[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:04.635]  We're good to go.
[00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.891]  For the rest of this fourth hour, we're going to be covering eugenics.
[00:00:20.391 --> 00:00:35.294]  Coming up in 30 minutes, how the eugenicists are using the fake environmental movement to not deal with real environmental crises and problems that the elite is actually generating, like out-of-control cross-species genetic engineering, toxic waste dumping, things of that nature.
[00:00:36.594 --> 00:00:39.315]  But how they're bringing in this global carbon tax and how that fits in.
[00:00:39.335 --> 00:00:40.515]  So for about 10 minutes,
[00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:47.335]  Coming up in a half hour, Paul's going to pop in with some new developments on that front with record cold weather.
[00:00:48.756 --> 00:01:10.645]  But I wanted to, before we get into eugenics, at the start of this live hour of video at PrisonPlanet.tv, every day during the fourth hour we go live, I wanted to draw a picture for listeners out there, a very simple crude picture that describes effectively the false left-right paradigm.
[00:01:13.945 --> 00:01:26.594]  Now, in an earlier hour, I was describing how the Republican Party props up the Democratic Party, and the Democratic Party props up the Republican Party.
[00:01:28.115 --> 00:01:37.702]  If you had one of the political parties standing on its own, standing on its own,
[00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:40.851]  When the wind came along, it would just fall over.
[00:01:41.331 --> 00:01:57.502]  When pressure, revolutionary pressure from the population, not liking what's going on, or new groups wanting the power structure, which is the main source of revolution, most of it is driven by evil, just like the elite is driven by evil.
[00:01:58.543 --> 00:02:00.665]  Very rare to have an altruistic revolution.
[00:02:04.807 --> 00:02:08.050]  By itself, a single party system will fall over.
[00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.860]  Okay?
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:21.262]  But, if you take the two party systems and you lean them up against each other, this is basically the arch.
[00:02:23.223 --> 00:02:37.346]  Their force going together keeps them together and makes it become a very strong, stable platform on which they can build their hierarchical New World Order system.
[00:02:38.706 --> 00:02:38.986]  Okay?
[00:02:40.202 --> 00:02:46.365]  So the current two-party system has been dominated and bought up and controlled by the elite that sits atop it.
[00:02:47.886 --> 00:02:53.989]  Now the elite, with a one-party system, would not be balanced on top of one party.
[00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.631]  They would be subject to being toppled.
[00:02:59.573 --> 00:03:02.394]  Being pushed over easily.
[00:03:03.795 --> 00:03:09.298]  But, you put the two parties up against each other, they form a royal arch.
[00:03:10.987 --> 00:03:17.831]  And now, it's very hard to separate those two, because they're leaning up against each other.
[00:03:19.591 --> 00:03:20.392]  I'm running out of paper.
[00:03:20.432 --> 00:03:21.693]  Will somebody bring me another piece of paper?
[00:03:21.713 --> 00:03:24.234]  I mean, this is really simple, but I want to explain this to people.
[00:03:25.815 --> 00:03:26.635]  Here, I've got one right here.
[00:03:26.675 --> 00:03:27.015]  It's fine.
[00:03:28.736 --> 00:03:29.537]  Check it out, folks.
[00:03:31.478 --> 00:03:35.840]  Why do you see so many leftists like, who mean well, like Rage Against the Machine,
[00:03:39.861 --> 00:03:52.507]  Tom Morello, or the guy we had on yesterday, Henry Rollins, who are right on so many issues, but then believe in leftist policies.
[00:03:52.527 --> 00:03:53.828]  We need a global carbon tax!
[00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:56.610]  But there's an elite funding that.
[00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.050]  No, no, no, the elite!
[00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.573]  The big corporations are against it, because the media advertises that big corporations and oil companies are against it.
[00:04:03.873 --> 00:04:06.875]  Henry Rollins doesn't know, doesn't have the documents,
[00:04:08.988 --> 00:04:17.472]  It doesn't understand that actually that's part of a sophisticated game that, oh, the big corporations say publicly, we don't want this, it's bad, while they actually fund it.
[00:04:18.473 --> 00:04:25.516]  They know that the public's awake to the fact that they're corrupt, so the public will be fooled and go and support the agenda.
[00:04:26.177 --> 00:04:27.938]  It's, please don't throw me in the briar patch.
[00:04:27.978 --> 00:04:30.499]  It's the old briar rabbit situation.
[00:04:34.121 --> 00:04:35.782]  So that's basically what we're dealing with here.
[00:04:36.742 --> 00:04:38.143]  And so you've got both parties
[00:04:39.443 --> 00:04:43.327]  Leaning into each other, supporting the other one.
[00:04:43.667 --> 00:04:46.270]  When we come back I'll briefly finish this and I promise we're getting into eugenics.
[00:04:47.431 --> 00:04:51.415]  It's just that the Republicans' criticism of the Democrats props them up.
[00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:54.378]  The Democratic criticism of the Republicans props them up.
[00:04:54.618 --> 00:04:56.760]  It's a very simple equation.
[00:04:59.022 --> 00:05:00.764]  I'm going to skip this break for InfoWars listeners.
[00:05:02.182 --> 00:05:06.703]  Because, you know, I got Aaron in here and he's been sitting there for 20 minutes while I took calls and went into other subjects.
[00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:16.126]  And yes, your calls are coming up too, but especially for the video viewers out there on PrisonPlanet.tv and all the members that ripped this and put it all over the web, we appreciate that.
[00:05:17.766 --> 00:05:19.947]  Members just get it live and in higher quality.
[00:05:20.887 --> 00:05:22.968]  We're very thankful to PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:05:23.688 --> 00:05:26.929]  Let me go ahead and just explain this as simply as I can.
[00:05:27.864 --> 00:05:29.205]  Here's the political field.
[00:05:30.045 --> 00:05:32.327]  And this is where the population resides.
[00:05:33.027 --> 00:05:38.991]  And then we supposedly, through the grassroots, come up into the political party.
[00:05:40.512 --> 00:05:40.853]  Okay?
[00:05:43.534 --> 00:05:46.897]  And then they lean on each other, as I was saying earlier, and support each other.
[00:05:46.937 --> 00:05:53.401]  If they're standing alone, the pressure of revolution or of new power structures will easily topple it and blow it over.
[00:05:53.721 --> 00:05:57.364]  But leaning together, it's not going to fall down.
[00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:58.830]  Okay?
[00:05:59.711 --> 00:06:03.772]  Now, I know that's simple, but let me give you an everyday example of this.
[00:06:03.993 --> 00:06:20.060]  As I said, the left sees all of these evil mainline Republicans who we know are liars, and who the media even exposes as being liars, they see them lying about everything else, so if the Republicans come out and say, we're against a global carbon tax, well then, by God, I'm for a global carbon tax.
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.423]  And so that's how the two sides leaning up against each other
[00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:30.372]  Give the other side support.
[00:06:31.493 --> 00:06:38.360]  And so, Democrats over here, Republicans over here, Republicans attack Barack Obama.
[00:06:39.481 --> 00:06:41.844]  And then the Democrats attack John McCain.
[00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:58.125]  And then the population who's down here is trained to see John McCain as representing them personally, as being their daddy, of where their personal power comes from, of their camp, their brand name, their brand of soda, their brand of automobile, Ford or Chevy.
[00:06:58.846 --> 00:07:01.589]  And so this is a controlled paradigm.
[00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:03.270]  And so we have
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:24.621]  We have Republicans attacking Democrats and that's the force against them and you have Democrats attacking Republicans and that's the force against them and really it's one unit supporting themselves and containing revolution so that the people who are down here never learned that there is a world outside of
[00:07:27.461 --> 00:07:28.681]  This controlled paradigm.
[00:07:28.961 --> 00:07:45.546]  We are locked within the left-right paradigm, and then it becomes this huge pageant, this huge distraction where we analyze every facet of the two political parties, never realizing they themselves are simply a front or puppets for a larger power structure.
[00:07:46.086 --> 00:07:47.327]  Now this is incredibly simple.
[00:07:48.089 --> 00:07:49.289]  But that's how this works.
[00:07:49.529 --> 00:07:55.191]  And then the two parties can limit the issues that are debated to this control paradigm.
[00:07:55.531 --> 00:08:04.154]  They can limit the scope of differences which, if you look at it, there's almost no difference between the two.
[00:08:04.654 --> 00:08:07.635]  Instead of getting the people to look outside the box at the wider world.
[00:08:07.995 --> 00:08:08.896]  Okay, we're going back live.
[00:08:08.936 --> 00:08:09.316]  Here we go.
[00:08:10.476 --> 00:08:13.477]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.296 --> 00:08:19.523]  Okay, for the rest of the hour, Aaron Dyches is with us.
[00:08:20.045 --> 00:08:21.851]  We did a four-part series
[00:08:23.251 --> 00:08:29.576]  Almost a year ago on Eugenics, the history of it, how it formed, how it started up until the modern time.
[00:08:29.816 --> 00:08:37.202]  But I thought, why not drag Aaron back in today to just give a basic overview instead of you meticulously going through all the facts, the diagrams, the documents.
[00:08:37.222 --> 00:08:38.043]  We'll cover some of those.
[00:08:38.303 --> 00:08:39.404]  They're covered in Endgame.
[00:08:39.604 --> 00:08:42.146]  There's a bibliography online for the film Endgame.
[00:08:42.546 --> 00:08:45.489]  Whatistheendgame.com or endgamethemovie.com.
[00:08:45.949 --> 00:08:50.032]  For folks out there, you can see a lot of this there on the site or get the DVD and see it.
[00:08:50.733 --> 00:08:51.494]  But Aaron,
[00:08:52.234 --> 00:09:05.386]  I wanted to go over with you today, you know, just basically your view on eugenics and the scientific dictatorship because during a break I was briefly talking about the scientific dictatorship in the first hour.
[00:09:06.343 --> 00:09:10.504]  I spent about thirty minutes on it, and you're like, I can't believe more hosts don't talk about the scientific dictatorship.
[00:09:10.544 --> 00:09:16.765]  I can't believe more people aren't aware of the scientific dictatorship, because it really is the key to everything, understanding the elite.
[00:09:17.105 --> 00:09:30.148]  So, from now until the next segment, give people a basic historical rundown, what we're dealing with, the elitist mindset, how eugenics tied in perfectly with the mindset that elites and royals already had of themselves being a different breed, like
[00:09:31.388 --> 00:09:35.831]  Going back to Plato believed, engineering, breeding the population.
[00:09:36.491 --> 00:09:43.355]  Break it down for us, just a basic overview today because this really is what governs our entire planet and it deserves more discussion.
[00:09:44.073 --> 00:09:52.515]  Well, eugenics, by definition, was the whole movement to control human breeding, according to supposedly scientifically crafted elite minds.
[00:09:53.015 --> 00:09:59.376]  And it fits in perfectly well with the way world government and control of societies in the 20th century took place, too.
[00:09:59.456 --> 00:10:03.077]  It's all about engineered society, engineered populations.
[00:10:03.637 --> 00:10:11.259]  And the whole idea is that we, the general public, cannot see above the threshold to make proper decisions, so they have to be made for us.
[00:10:11.559 --> 00:10:14.642]  And again, we see that at every level of left-to-right control paradigm.
[00:10:14.842 --> 00:10:35.920]  They're always trying to shorten the horizon, bring in the blinders, bring people into a very small, looking at the world through a straw, instead of, in a big panoramic view, limiting the data, limiting the terms to where people stay in their parties, stay in their racial groups, stay in their regional groups, and then they can play us off against each other using basic psychology.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:55.111]  Yeah, that's really interesting that you put it that way, actually, because from Edward Bernays to Carol Quigley, all the way up to Ray Kurzweil in the modern day, and also Brzezinski in the 70s, they've all used the same basic metaphor of shrinking time and space throughout the 20th century being the reason we have to have this world government.
[00:10:55.131 --> 00:10:56.352]  And that's what Orwell says.
[00:10:56.392 --> 00:11:02.576]  He says we're going to destroy the language, shrink it down, limit its use, where you can't physically communicate with people.
[00:11:02.856 --> 00:11:09.441]  And due to planes, trains, automobiles, instant communication, we couldn't possibly escape, you know, world political control.
[00:11:09.481 --> 00:11:11.983]  We can't possibly escape total domination.
[00:11:12.664 --> 00:11:20.030]  And it's just disgusting because everything they've engineered has turned out to be a fraud, a hoax, or just otherwise malignant.
[00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:24.053]  I mean, everything they've scientifically engineered has only brought us down, really.
[00:11:25.014 --> 00:11:30.178]  While it may be genius in a pure research sense, it really hasn't helped human beings as a whole.
[00:11:30.546 --> 00:11:36.250]  Well, I mean, it's a religion of greediness and control and domination, taking control of the species.
[00:11:36.931 --> 00:11:48.239]  Which is fair enough to argue may be human nature, but, you know, the whole eugenics is built on... Well, they also say it's human nature for us to be evil and greedy, so we're going to fully embrace it.
[00:11:48.619 --> 00:11:50.020]  And that's why we're so strong.
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:50.941]  You're weak.
[00:11:50.981 --> 00:11:52.442]  You have these moral conventions.
[00:11:52.802 --> 00:11:54.143]  But it's wrong from the basis.
[00:11:54.203 --> 00:12:02.330]  I mean, if that's human nature based on evolution, then humans steering human evolution is never going to craft a better human.
[00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:05.652]  I mean, if they really wanted to improve the human race, it would be freedom.
[00:12:05.833 --> 00:12:07.034]  But that's not what they're doing.
[00:12:07.354 --> 00:12:14.680]  Because when you read into their deeper documents that they sell the lower eugenicists on making a better society, they really admit it's about dumbing down their competition.
[00:12:15.086 --> 00:12:15.687]  Yeah, certainly.
[00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:21.397]  And you can see that in the parable of Huxley's Brave New World.
[00:12:22.159 --> 00:12:23.361]  I mean, it's pretty straightforward.
[00:12:24.022 --> 00:12:24.503]  Continue!
[00:12:27.133 --> 00:12:33.658]  Yeah, I mean, going along with the engineered society, I think propaganda kind of parallels the eugenics thing as well.
[00:12:35.359 --> 00:12:43.004]  Edward Bernays talked about regimenting the public mind every bit as much as an army regiments their bodies, and that's the same thing they wanted to do.
[00:12:43.044 --> 00:12:45.406]  They wanted to regiment human breeding with eugenics.
[00:12:46.087 --> 00:12:47.608]  But it's all about society control.
[00:12:47.668 --> 00:12:49.429]  I mean, we had to look at this in the 20th century
[00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:52.351]  Panorama overview.
[00:12:52.391 --> 00:12:53.712]  And that's why the elites are in control.
[00:12:53.772 --> 00:12:55.434]  They're into engineering things.
[00:12:55.454 --> 00:12:58.837]  They're into master planning, and they're master planning your minds.
[00:12:59.177 --> 00:13:04.582]  And by you being taught to deny that, it's like a child, you know, denying that walking down the street can get him killed.
[00:13:05.002 --> 00:13:10.547]  You deny your personal power and your destiny to be involved in the direction of the planetary development.
[00:13:12.789 --> 00:13:13.550]  Yeah, I agree.
[00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:15.792]  Continue, you've got a lot of quotes and articles there.
[00:13:17.291 --> 00:13:28.017]  Well, one of the things I hadn't discovered at the time of the making of Endgame, which is when I got into reading all this stuff, I know a lot of our listeners have known about this for a long time, is what a great example H.G.
[00:13:28.057 --> 00:13:32.860]  Wells is of both the quest for world government and eugenics.
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.843]  And he was, of course, a protege of the Darwin and Galton family.
[00:13:38.443 --> 00:13:39.404]  He was trained by them.
[00:13:40.224 --> 00:13:40.484]  I think?
[00:14:02.792 --> 00:14:07.254]  In the name of crafting a utopia, it's just detrimental to human nature.
[00:14:07.274 --> 00:14:07.855]  Well, let's be clear.
[00:14:07.875 --> 00:14:08.335]  The H.G.
[00:14:08.375 --> 00:14:13.357]  Wells is actually embraced by the Zionists and many others, because they admire the model of eugenics.
[00:14:14.018 --> 00:14:17.699]  They just think they are... all these groups think they are the God-man.
[00:14:17.759 --> 00:14:25.223]  They all think, you know, the black liberation folks think they're the God-man, the Zionists think they're the God-man, the Nazis think they're the God-man, continue.
[00:14:26.001 --> 00:14:30.686]  Yeah, but it's really just domination by elites at the end of the day.
[00:14:31.606 --> 00:14:40.595]  Just as in propaganda, we're controlled by an elite at the top, now we're supposed to have science crafting us and steering human breeding.
[00:14:41.756 --> 00:14:42.457]  It's just disgusting.
[00:14:43.458 --> 00:14:45.860]  It's a separation of the species, as they write about.
[00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:48.963]  And they're also teaching us that we don't have free will, which we clearly do.
[00:14:49.843 --> 00:14:59.692]  And our quote, higher mindset or spirit, whatever you want to call it, the higher attributes of man versus the more bestial and low.
[00:15:00.713 --> 00:15:05.538]  But they tell us every day and everywhere, men's fidelity controlled by cheating genetics.
[00:15:06.926 --> 00:15:10.807]  Well, I mean, they claim gambling is genetic.
[00:15:10.867 --> 00:15:16.168]  No, it's somebody who gets into the risk-taking and who wasn't taught that was dangerous and who didn't stay away from it.
[00:15:16.408 --> 00:15:21.590]  So they tell parents, don't try to keep your kids away from gambling, or don't tell them that cheating is wrong because it will ruin your children's lives.
[00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:26.571]  No, just say it's okay and it's my genetics, so I'm going to do it.
[00:15:27.091 --> 00:15:33.355]  Yeah, well, gambling, just like all the rest of this, is playing into a controlled paradigm, which is what I'm most offended by, really.
[00:15:33.375 --> 00:15:34.356]  It's the manipulation.
[00:15:34.836 --> 00:15:40.300]  Going into a situation thinking you have free will and an equal shot when it's really rigged stakes.
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:41.341]  The odds are rigged.
[00:15:41.961 --> 00:15:42.902]  Yeah, we can get back to that.
[00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:45.043]  Go ahead.
[00:15:50.587 --> 00:15:51.428]  Well, yeah, I think it's a...
[00:15:53.373 --> 00:15:54.374]  It's a controlled paradigm.
[00:15:55.196 --> 00:15:56.878]  You've got hundreds of articles there you printed off.
[00:15:56.938 --> 00:16:00.022]  I mean, just your overall view on this, what you've discovered.
[00:16:00.062 --> 00:16:05.449]  We were talking behind the scenes about how real this is, how this is all the elite talks about continually.
[00:16:05.469 --> 00:16:06.571]  This is the real world.
[00:16:07.032 --> 00:16:08.614]  And the general public isn't even aware of it.
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:25.450]  Well, I think in the larger scheme, eugenics came through Malthus, and then later through the Darwins, and I think that was partially paralleled with the Industrial Revolution displacing the value of human labor, you know, dehumanizing humans itself.
[00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:29.032]  And I think the new revolution... And making humans a bad thing!
[00:16:29.997 --> 00:16:31.078]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:16:31.098 --> 00:16:38.481]  I mean, you know, debasing us down to just raw material so the elites morally could feel good about what they're doing.
[00:16:39.362 --> 00:16:40.883]  I mean, these are competing ideologies.
[00:16:40.923 --> 00:16:43.884]  Why do the Darwinists seek to discredit and destroy Christianity?
[00:16:43.944 --> 00:16:45.165]  I'm not weighing in on the debate.
[00:16:45.585 --> 00:16:46.566]  I'm saying, why do they seek?
[00:16:46.606 --> 00:16:49.427]  Because they are overthrowing an existing religion.
[00:16:49.767 --> 00:16:53.009]  Why does Scientology seek to overthrow psychiatry?
[00:16:53.469 --> 00:16:56.231]  Because they are seeking to overthrow that religion.
[00:16:56.251 --> 00:16:58.132]  And it is a religion, both of them are.
[00:16:58.652 --> 00:17:02.714]  So you always have the new, in a revolutionary way, trying to overthrow the old.
[00:17:02.734 --> 00:17:13.759]  Well, I think that's true, but I think in terms of the human pyramid, just as the Industrial Revolution displaced human labor, Bertrand Russell talks about that and the impact of science on society.
[00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:20.322]  Today, with the technological revolutions and the information revolutions, it's an even greater displacement of human values.
[00:17:20.342 --> 00:17:23.464]  And they say this over and over again, they say, whereas before life was cheap,
[00:17:24.224 --> 00:17:25.025]  And blood was cheap.
[00:17:25.085 --> 00:17:26.326]  Now you're a liability.
[00:17:26.367 --> 00:17:27.488]  Now we want to get rid of you.
[00:17:27.528 --> 00:17:29.110]  They've been having this debate for 80 years.
[00:17:30.151 --> 00:17:41.123]  That's why in the Kurzweil paradigm and his other contemporaries, it's this discussion of, well, should we, you know, politely sort of maintain the human population or just wipe them out altogether?
[00:17:41.203 --> 00:17:56.417]  And by the way, these guys run the planet, and then you try to tell the mind-controlled public, they drool at you and laugh, because that's scary, that there's this big technocratic technocracy putting cancer viruses in your vaccines, and you're giggling and laughing as every cancer goes up thousands of percentage points.
[00:17:56.777 --> 00:17:58.119]  I mean, this isn't a game, folks.
[00:17:58.139 --> 00:17:58.859]  This isn't a joke.
[00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.721]  They're killing us right now.
[00:18:01.161 --> 00:18:05.085]  Well, they've invested in this program, so there's no way they could pull out the elites themselves.
[00:18:05.726 --> 00:18:07.187]  The whole structure is built around it.
[00:18:07.347 --> 00:18:08.830]  Yeah, they're psychologically built.
[00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:11.995]  The British Royalty got behind this 150 years ago and that's it!
[00:18:12.375 --> 00:18:17.904]  And they believe time and space are concentrating and that human genocide is basically inevitable.
[00:18:18.806 --> 00:18:19.106]  That's it.
[00:18:19.126 --> 00:18:24.029]  They believe everything is accelerating and if they don't cold-bloodedly kill the majority of us, then we're going to destroy ourselves.
[00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:26.231]  Meanwhile, they hand out nukes to Pakistan.
[00:18:26.271 --> 00:18:29.833]  They hand out these mousepox designed to kill every mammal on earth.
[00:18:30.293 --> 00:18:34.236]  They cross-species splice everything.
[00:18:35.316 --> 00:18:36.157]  It's like they're devils.
[00:18:36.637 --> 00:18:40.700]  They're busy destroying everything and then they offer the solution as it's all being destroyed.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.803]  Yeah, in a geopolitical sense, it's a policy of tension.
[00:18:44.843 --> 00:18:46.184]  There's so many distractions.
[00:18:46.264 --> 00:18:46.925]  Well, they say that.
[00:18:46.985 --> 00:18:51.429]  They say somebody's going to destroy it, so we'll destroy things so we're in control of the process.
[00:18:51.449 --> 00:18:51.709]  Go ahead.
[00:18:52.370 --> 00:19:02.338]  Yeah, it keeps us distracted from the real issues, too, because we think we're fighting AIDS, the isolated human epidemic, when it turns out that it's steered by science.
[00:19:05.439 --> 00:19:11.822]  It's about institutionalizing AIDS and covering it up and beta testing a soft kill age when they're getting ready to release a much worse age.
[00:19:12.022 --> 00:19:15.983]  I think it's also about how the system has to design new problems.
[00:19:16.183 --> 00:19:20.485]  Huxley talks about iatric diseases, diseases caused by doctors.
[00:19:21.746 --> 00:19:33.230]  We've cured a few diseases over the ages, but only by subjecting all of society to more diseases and the more intervention they do, the more problems we have.
[00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:47.214]  And they're contagious, so they've got to build a social control grid in the name of stopping other communicable diseases from third world populations, so then they can get us more herded into compact systems, so they can release the more destructive controlled weapons.
[00:19:47.634 --> 00:19:49.995]  Right, it's about being herded into the compact system.
[00:19:50.395 --> 00:19:54.937]  Just like with politics, freedom is really a better solution, but they want to have us herded together.
[00:19:54.957 --> 00:19:59.418]  All right, I'm going to skip this break for InfoWars.com audio stream listeners will be the only ones that can hear it.
[00:19:59.738 --> 00:20:01.159]  Everybody else will be back in four minutes.
[00:20:02.859 --> 00:20:10.084]  Yeah, I want to draw another picture of that for the PrisonPlanet.TV viewers, if you guys can punch that up for me.
[00:20:14.728 --> 00:20:17.049]  So, there we go.
[00:20:17.169 --> 00:20:18.190]  Okay, check this out.
[00:20:19.151 --> 00:20:30.439]  Now, earlier I explained how one political party is clearly the power structure and the people can rebel against it and bring it down, destroy it, and replace it.
[00:20:31.735 --> 00:20:34.016]  Doesn't mean that necessarily what it's replaced with will be better.
[00:20:34.596 --> 00:20:34.916]  Okay?
[00:20:36.656 --> 00:20:57.902]  But if they can control a nation, the true elite, by putting puppet governments or parliaments with different power structures in front, where they've bought off and control the leaders of all the groups, or maybe three of the groups, then if this guy gets too powerful, they can have these groups gang up on this guy,
[00:20:59.224 --> 00:21:00.404]  Okay, so that's another structure.
[00:21:01.004 --> 00:21:24.429]  I mean, I'm simplifying all of this, but earlier I was describing how a one-party system will fall over on its own, but if you have two parties leaning up against each other, the pressure of the two forces coming together will make it very, very sturdy and very, very strong and hard to bring down.
[00:21:25.489 --> 00:21:28.170]  Also, by controlling the two parties in the left-right system,
[00:21:30.242 --> 00:21:43.050]  Then the people will put all of their energy into trying to affect the two columns that are joined and are operating under the control of
[00:21:45.014 --> 00:21:50.476]  the outside elite that is controlling the contained paradigm.
[00:21:51.036 --> 00:21:54.977]  All I'm saying is, folks, you need to get out of this controlled paradigm.
[00:21:55.297 --> 00:21:56.338]  It doesn't mean listen to me.
[00:21:56.378 --> 00:21:57.338]  It doesn't mean believe me.
[00:21:57.358 --> 00:21:58.178]  It doesn't mean any of that.
[00:21:58.718 --> 00:22:00.819]  It means start looking outside the box.
[00:22:00.879 --> 00:22:01.799]  Start pulling back.
[00:22:02.239 --> 00:22:03.340]  Start connecting the dots.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.680]  Don't be too close to the problem.
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:06.021]  You're right here.
[00:22:06.121 --> 00:22:07.501]  You need to get over here.
[00:22:08.361 --> 00:22:09.942]  And you don't just need
[00:22:10.942 --> 00:22:15.005]  To be looking over here, or looking over here, or looking over here at what I said.
[00:22:15.025 --> 00:22:16.066]  Look at whatever you want.
[00:22:16.767 --> 00:22:17.747]  Look in all directions.
[00:22:18.508 --> 00:22:19.589]  Walk off the page.
[00:22:20.429 --> 00:22:23.231]  You know, you can decide to be a little person.
[00:22:23.252 --> 00:22:25.513]  Here, I'll draw a little person.
[00:22:31.618 --> 00:22:31.938]  See?
[00:22:33.299 --> 00:22:39.224]  You can decide to be a little person, and instead of, you know, being in this controlled paradigm,
[00:22:41.704 --> 00:22:44.965]  Right here, you can just march off.
[00:22:46.385 --> 00:22:48.666]  And you can go investigate or look at whatever you want.
[00:22:49.106 --> 00:23:00.889]  The point is, there is no doubt, and more and more Americans know, with Congress with a 9% approval rating, that's 9%, people now know this is a fraud.
[00:23:00.929 --> 00:23:01.609]  They know it's bull.
[00:23:01.689 --> 00:23:05.050]  But, you know, that's why the elite didn't care before.
[00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:10.132]  They'd give you two old white guys and act like they ran and let people fight over which old white guy was going to run things.
[00:23:11.431 --> 00:23:14.832]  To make people think that, you know, the power ended with those presidents or prime ministers.
[00:23:15.132 --> 00:23:28.415]  Well, now they know that people are getting away from the process and they keep saying about Barack Obama and now about Sarah Palin, oh, they're new, they're fresh, it's a woman, she's unexperienced, oh, it's a black guy, he's unexperienced, but at least it's changed.
[00:23:28.436 --> 00:23:30.036]  We'll see what change on the surface.
[00:23:31.681 --> 00:23:33.623]  They could be green-skinned, purple-skinned.
[00:23:34.604 --> 00:23:35.184]  They're puppets.
[00:23:35.204 --> 00:23:36.746]  They're not running anything, so it doesn't matter.
[00:23:36.966 --> 00:23:41.611]  And I know you know that, but the general public is not aware of this fully.
[00:23:43.226 --> 00:24:01.380]  And all you see from the power structure is an attempt to suck people back into the false paradigm, back into the blinders, back into not looking outside the two parties, where we can get real solutions, take over our local governments, have a revolution of understanding, and stop trusting the corrupt people that are running our society.
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:02.801]  Let's go back to eugenics.
[00:24:02.821 --> 00:24:03.542]  Did you get any quotes?
[00:24:03.562 --> 00:24:04.342]  Because I know you had a lot of quotes.
[00:24:04.362 --> 00:24:05.263]  I wanted to cover quotes.
[00:24:06.564 --> 00:24:08.606]  I mean, I know I told you just a little bit before we went on air here.
[00:24:08.806 --> 00:24:10.987]  Yeah, I don't have a very good source of quotes in front of me.
[00:24:11.148 --> 00:24:15.071]  Well, people can refer back on the archives of the first four eugenics pieces we did.
[00:24:15.111 --> 00:24:15.371]  Here we go.
[00:24:20.868 --> 00:24:22.790]  You know, Aaron, I want to do a show in the next few weeks.
[00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:23.611]  I can pull these too.
[00:24:23.651 --> 00:24:24.892]  There's sites for thousands of them.
[00:24:25.273 --> 00:24:30.878]  But we sent off to the libraries and to... Where are all those big boxes of eugenics books and documents we got?
[00:24:31.559 --> 00:24:32.260]  Most of it's in there.
[00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:33.621]  Why don't you go get that?
[00:24:33.641 --> 00:24:35.383]  I want to show people the research on TV.
[00:24:36.624 --> 00:24:37.004]  Because...
[00:24:38.234 --> 00:24:40.515]  You know, we did off and on a year of research.
[00:24:40.815 --> 00:24:56.261]  We've done all this other research before, I have, but we went back and if we saw a Margaret Singer quote online about black people being weed, she wanted to kill all of them, you know, to the Colgate Foundation or whatever, we would go and send off to a university and get Xerox copies of the official letter.
[00:24:56.982 --> 00:25:00.383]  And then we had so much evil that we didn't even put that in the film, in-game.
[00:25:01.404 --> 00:25:04.305]  I mean, you know, that's the level of this stuff.
[00:25:04.345 --> 00:25:06.706]  It's like yesterday, I had one of my new IT guys in here,
[00:25:07.674 --> 00:25:08.294]  Paul Hartman.
[00:25:10.075 --> 00:25:13.376]  And he's like, yeah, my wife couldn't believe me about the vaccines.
[00:25:13.396 --> 00:25:19.717]  And I said, well, you know, they're putting AIDS in over a million ampules of factor VIII blood product.
[00:25:20.818 --> 00:25:25.899]  And he just started shaking his head like, I said, oh, let's just go to, I just typed it in and pulled up MSNBC and they admitted it.
[00:25:26.499 --> 00:25:27.100]  Here, let me see that.
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.400]  Show Aaron right now, guys.
[00:25:30.165 --> 00:25:30.485]  Look at this.
[00:25:30.585 --> 00:25:31.046]  Let me see that.
[00:25:31.646 --> 00:25:35.169]  Now, this is just some of the research, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:36.010]  Look at this.
[00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:38.192]  This is just some of the eugenics stuff.
[00:25:38.652 --> 00:25:40.574]  And this is letters about how they're going to kill us.
[00:25:41.194 --> 00:25:41.575]  Not that one.
[00:25:42.115 --> 00:25:43.416]  That's Final Cut Studio stuff.
[00:25:43.436 --> 00:25:44.217]  Okay, all the others are.
[00:25:45.098 --> 00:25:50.202]  I mean, this is just, each one of these is completely population control.
[00:25:50.422 --> 00:25:52.104]  Eugenics, present, future.
[00:25:53.425 --> 00:25:53.705]  See that?
[00:25:55.936 --> 00:25:57.037]  And then it just goes through that.
[00:25:58.899 --> 00:25:59.339]  Quotes.
[00:25:59.379 --> 00:26:00.520]  You want eugenics quotes?
[00:26:03.603 --> 00:26:05.765]  There is a giant folder on quotes.
[00:26:07.407 --> 00:26:09.168]  You want Margaret Sanger letters.
[00:26:09.789 --> 00:26:10.750]  Let's see what's in here.
[00:26:13.532 --> 00:26:16.795]  I mean the amount of work that we went into on this film.
[00:26:17.676 --> 00:26:20.499]  How they're using the fake global warming movement
[00:26:21.676 --> 00:26:24.097]  Rothschild quotes about how they're going to control us.
[00:26:24.177 --> 00:26:33.762]  I mean, this type of research we do, and then you can't even... it's like you get the knowledge, and then you can't even cover it all.
[00:26:37.784 --> 00:26:39.285]  God, the amount of work we did on that film.
[00:26:39.325 --> 00:26:39.985]  It just blows me away.
[00:26:40.025 --> 00:26:40.506]  It's like 20 films.
[00:26:42.642 --> 00:26:49.595]  Transhumanism quotes about how they're going to kill all of us, and their own books, and how they want us to have a one-child policy.
[00:26:49.615 --> 00:26:50.898]  I mean, it's all right here.
[00:26:50.918 --> 00:26:53.001]  Aaron, any comments on all this?
[00:26:54.713 --> 00:26:56.335]  You know, we try to cover as much as we could.
[00:26:56.375 --> 00:26:58.417]  There's a lot of books and stuff you don't see here, too.
[00:26:59.137 --> 00:27:03.061]  And even more stuff that we just read online and cross-referenced.
[00:27:03.081 --> 00:27:08.106]  That's right, we had some ghostwriter author and then he, we didn't finish the project, he ran off with like ten books.
[00:27:08.126 --> 00:27:09.547]  I mean, we need to get him to give us our books back.
[00:27:09.988 --> 00:27:10.088]  Yeah.
[00:27:10.108 --> 00:27:13.431]  I don't know why he got paid for not doing the work and then ran off with our books.
[00:27:14.012 --> 00:27:15.273]  This whole country's falling apart.
[00:27:15.293 --> 00:27:18.956]  Oh my God.
[00:27:20.399 --> 00:27:21.319]  Anyways, keep going.
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:32.725]  Well, I think it's key that Nazi Germany is the country that ran away with eugenics, and they're also the country that was most statist, most centralized, and they're the ones who went too far with everything.
[00:27:33.065 --> 00:27:34.846]  Well, when the government gets its shot, what do they do?
[00:27:35.066 --> 00:27:39.828]  With foster children, 68% national average on more than one psychotropic drug.
[00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:43.510]  I mean, everywhere they have a controlled group, what do you get?
[00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:44.351]  You get hell on earth.
[00:27:44.391 --> 00:27:44.651]  Go ahead.
[00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:48.051]  Yeah, I mean, it's just eugenics is part of state control.
[00:27:48.071 --> 00:28:10.858]  I mean, the United States also centralized everything it did under FDR, and I've been perusing some various propaganda films, and just to reiterate the point, ad nauseam, you see how they controlled workers groups, how they controlled universities, how they controlled this particular sector of industry, this particular sector of industry, all behind the war effort, but it's still all
[00:28:13.149 --> 00:28:20.355]  It's centralization and control, and it's Nazi Germany who instituted marriage licenses, an idea that came from the U.S.
[00:28:20.395 --> 00:28:20.895]  and England.
[00:28:21.596 --> 00:28:29.642]  It's Nazi Germany who wanted to approve breeding for the elite and then liquidate the underclasses.
[00:28:29.842 --> 00:28:31.123]  You know what I just ran into here?
[00:28:31.143 --> 00:28:34.125]  And then the Nuremberg defense was, they learned this all from the U.S.
[00:28:34.165 --> 00:28:34.506]  and England.
[00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:37.973]  We just ran into the secret FEMA documents from the pastors.
[00:28:37.993 --> 00:28:38.994]  We never put that in the film.
[00:28:40.496 --> 00:28:42.078]  About the clergy response teams.
[00:28:42.098 --> 00:28:43.580]  Just ran into that again.
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:43.940]  Go ahead.
[00:28:45.362 --> 00:28:46.483]  There's no way to cover it all.
[00:28:46.623 --> 00:28:46.984]  Keep going.
[00:28:48.004 --> 00:28:57.954]  Well, yeah, I mean, everything you saw in Nazi Germany, the concentration camps, concentration camps were invented by the British during the Boer War, which just goes back to the 1920s.
[00:28:57.974 --> 00:28:58.894]  Well, that's a popular invention.
[00:28:58.914 --> 00:29:03.579]  They're actually used here in the war, you know, against the independent colonies.
[00:29:03.599 --> 00:29:04.760]  Oh, yeah, that's true.
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:05.901]  Andrew Jackson's family.
[00:29:05.921 --> 00:29:07.783]  Well, I guess nothing was invented, really, in history.
[00:29:07.883 --> 00:29:08.584]  Well, no, no, you're right.
[00:29:08.604 --> 00:29:12.187]  The official, when they were first called concentration camps, was in the Boer War.
[00:29:14.547 --> 00:29:23.440]  But yeah, overall I think eugenics was a movement to steer the world and to centralize control and it's just a concentration of breeding.
[00:29:23.481 --> 00:29:24.662]  I don't know what else to say about it.
[00:29:25.825 --> 00:29:30.629]  Stay with us when Paul Watson comes on, because how are they going to sell us on eugenics?
[00:29:30.649 --> 00:29:31.730]  They can't call it eugenics.
[00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:33.131]  They can't call it Nazism.
[00:29:33.471 --> 00:29:34.812]  They can't call it communism.
[00:29:34.872 --> 00:29:41.057]  All their other isms that the bankers use to push this, this social engineering, have been discredited.
[00:29:41.298 --> 00:29:42.218]  They have a new term.
[00:29:42.639 --> 00:29:43.539]  Environmentalism.
[00:29:43.559 --> 00:29:43.980]  Stay with us.
[00:29:46.391 --> 00:29:47.412]  We're going to skip this break.
[00:29:47.432 --> 00:29:50.854]  Aaron, keep talking other points you want to cover while we get Paul Watson on.
[00:29:51.615 --> 00:29:56.258]  One point I wanted to cover on your drawing you see there, which is kind of a policy of tension.
[00:29:56.698 --> 00:30:00.501]  You have the pillar of the Republicans leaning against the pillar of Democrats.
[00:30:00.521 --> 00:30:01.302]  Divide and conquer, yeah.
[00:30:01.362 --> 00:30:06.906]  Basically just like a mirror, just bouncing back energy back and forth, dissipating energy from the masses.
[00:30:07.746 --> 00:30:08.746]  Well, it's kind of like... That's it!
[00:30:08.786 --> 00:30:09.386]  It's a curtain.
[00:30:09.426 --> 00:30:10.207]  It shields them.
[00:30:10.227 --> 00:30:15.448]  They have this little play going on, where the two groups run out of the same people, disappear all the energy.
[00:30:15.648 --> 00:30:16.128]  Right, yeah.
[00:30:16.308 --> 00:30:26.430]  And it's a lot like what Huxley was talking about, about how you could control the masses militarily through terror and force, or you could control them with psychology.
[00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:33.552]  Well, this is just a simple ruse to eliminate 80-90% of the energy from any debate about anything political.
[00:30:33.832 --> 00:30:45.657]  Speaking about energy, real physical energy, this is a way to restrict our energy, restrict our free market, let government bureaucrats take over every facet of society, because energy output is killing the earth.
[00:30:45.977 --> 00:30:46.998]  Humans are bad.
[00:30:48.659 --> 00:30:50.840]  That's an interesting parallel there.
[00:30:50.980 --> 00:31:00.604]  But before they put it into scientific nomenclature, it was the kings are descended from God, the peasants are short and dumb, not because they've been starving for a hundred generations, but because they're scum.
[00:31:01.755 --> 00:31:15.205]  Yeah, and I think that's part of the elite's drive, is that they believe they're the ones with this knowledge, and just like the Prometheus myth where man takes fire from the gods, they're trying to replace the idea with gods with themselves.
[00:31:15.245 --> 00:31:16.025]  They're the new gods.
[00:31:16.265 --> 00:31:17.867]  And they know there's a cycle.
[00:31:17.927 --> 00:31:20.248]  They say over and over again, they don't want us getting the fire.
[00:31:20.288 --> 00:31:26.053]  It's like, they're the gods, they don't want us to get the fire of technology, so they're going to fluoride you, they're going to hit you with some mercury.
[00:31:26.793 --> 00:31:29.375]  Oh, you know, you stop taking the shots, we're going to put it in the air.
[00:31:29.675 --> 00:31:30.576]  We're going to put it in the food.
[00:31:31.707 --> 00:31:32.867]  Yeah, it's really frightening.
[00:31:34.528 --> 00:31:36.729]  That's why they're in control, though, because they care about control.
[00:31:36.749 --> 00:31:37.789]  They care about domination.
[00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:47.892]  Well, that is why they have the curtain set up, the smoke and mirror system, because if we could just see their note of power back there, I mean, it's still tens of thousands, but it's nothing compared to the masses of humanity.
[00:31:47.912 --> 00:31:52.513]  I mean, we could definitely physically outmaneuver them, and we could outthink them.
[00:31:52.533 --> 00:31:54.234]  But they told us they don't exist.
[00:31:54.654 --> 00:31:58.936]  It's like they project a rock wall up and the people have been taught, there was never an elite in history.
[00:31:59.296 --> 00:32:00.717]  There was never a corrupt force.
[00:32:01.197 --> 00:32:02.898]  We don't need to be involved in society.
[00:32:03.378 --> 00:32:06.300]  We don't need to stand up to poison in our food or bad stuff.
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:10.642]  But then we finally wake up to poison in our food and they say, yeah, you're dying because of the environment.
[00:32:10.682 --> 00:32:11.842]  Meanwhile, they're doing it by design.
[00:32:12.463 --> 00:32:14.083]  I mean, they are some slick bastards, man.
[00:32:14.544 --> 00:32:21.227]  Imagine having no morals, no qualms, totally ruthless and unlimited funds.
[00:32:22.645 --> 00:32:25.146]  But, because it's so dastardly, we have a chance of beating him.
[00:32:25.166 --> 00:32:25.746]  What are you doing, Aaron?
[00:32:25.766 --> 00:32:27.347]  I wanted to get this folder on the very bottom.
[00:32:29.528 --> 00:32:31.248]  I'm going to bring Watson in.
[00:32:31.268 --> 00:32:32.209]  Why don't you take these out?
[00:32:32.529 --> 00:32:32.729]  Great.
[00:32:32.769 --> 00:32:34.289]  And put them back on their nest, wherever that is.
[00:32:34.589 --> 00:32:36.970]  There's only a small amount of the stuff around here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32:37.451 --> 00:32:38.291]  Documentation.
[00:32:39.131 --> 00:32:42.072]  But again, I mean, I've had liberals go, Margaret Sanger's bad.
[00:32:42.132 --> 00:32:43.973]  I thought she was loving.
[00:32:43.993 --> 00:32:46.434]  I've had black people, Margaret Sanger.
[00:32:47.494 --> 00:32:48.655]  I was taught she loved me.
[00:32:50.891 --> 00:32:58.542]  Oh, she wants you to have the right to, you know, quote, go to any school you want so you can get your deadly injections.
[00:32:58.562 --> 00:33:00.304]  And I'm not weighing in on segregation.
[00:33:00.344 --> 00:33:04.870]  The point is, these are some sick bastards, folks, and they believe in what they're doing.
[00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:05.631]  Do we have Paul Watson?
[00:33:06.092 --> 00:33:06.933]  He's all set and ready.
[00:33:06.973 --> 00:33:07.254]  Here we go.
[00:33:16.141 --> 00:33:17.382]  Okay, we're back live.
[00:33:17.402 --> 00:33:18.582]  Paul Watson joins us.
[00:33:19.422 --> 00:33:21.964]  He had a story today up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:33:22.424 --> 00:33:25.105]  Global cooling unprecedented ice storms in Kenya.
[00:33:25.825 --> 00:33:31.368]  All the major governmental 10-year weather stations report record cold in the last 10 years.
[00:33:32.208 --> 00:33:35.430]  And if it continues, it's going to be one of the coldest decades coming up on record.
[00:33:35.711 --> 00:33:40.074]  The sun was the hottest it's ever been recorded in 200 plus years, with the most sunspots.
[00:33:40.574 --> 00:33:47.059]  And the spot's just an explosion on the sun, shinning out different types of radiation at the planet and out into space.
[00:33:47.139 --> 00:33:49.501]  Now there are no spots for the first time ever.
[00:33:49.941 --> 00:33:53.164]  No spots, meaning really cold weather's coming.
[00:33:54.128 --> 00:33:57.411]  And it'll take a few years to get here, but boy, we're going to be freezing our butts off.
[00:33:57.871 --> 00:34:01.274]  They've already shifted gears, the globalists, and they're saying it's now global cooling.
[00:34:01.674 --> 00:34:03.075]  Gotta ban carbon dioxide.
[00:34:03.095 --> 00:34:03.775]  That means tax you.
[00:34:03.795 --> 00:34:04.836]  They're not going to really ban it.
[00:34:05.777 --> 00:34:06.538]  License it.
[00:34:07.618 --> 00:34:10.260]  A license is an authorization to do something that would be illegal.
[00:34:11.401 --> 00:34:14.222]  And this is their eugenics control grid and they state it's that.
[00:34:14.662 --> 00:34:24.105]  To keep your energy usage down, to control you, to regulate you, to make you a third world slave, so you have to be under government control and government health care for eugenics.
[00:34:24.605 --> 00:34:25.645]  You think it's free health care?
[00:34:26.026 --> 00:34:27.026]  No, it's a eugenics
[00:34:28.266 --> 00:34:29.467]  Good to be back, Alex.
[00:34:29.487 --> 00:34:36.230]  Well, what's going on with the weather is the fact that there has been no global warming since 1998, and now they admit that there will be no global warming over the next ten years.
[00:34:58.818 --> 00:35:04.239]  And the consequences in the rapid decrease of solar activity.
[00:35:04.964 --> 00:35:07.465]  are beginning to be felt across the globe.
[00:35:08.065 --> 00:35:13.726]  And again, we had the entire solar system for the last 25 years with probes and telescopes.
[00:35:14.286 --> 00:35:23.749]  Liquid, hard, frozen moons of Jupiter and Saturn are now liquid seas of methane and things like that.
[00:35:23.789 --> 00:35:25.489]  They're not H2O, unfortunately.
[00:35:25.769 --> 00:35:32.791]  But the point is, we have volcanoes going off on Mars, ice caps shrinking by a mile a year on Mars, and what is
[00:35:33.911 --> 00:35:36.353]  You know, what do the global warming people say?
[00:35:36.393 --> 00:35:39.635]  They just say, nope, Saturn and Jupiter are closer to the Sun than Earth.
[00:35:40.016 --> 00:35:42.698]  They say, nope, there are no ice caps on Mars.
[00:35:42.838 --> 00:35:45.300]  Of course there are, but they know the public are dumbed down.
[00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:57.729]  Well, the fact is, Alex, that according to all the polls, even though this global warming propaganda is going out at all levels on an incessant basis,
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:00.301]  People aren't buying it.
[00:36:00.682 --> 00:36:08.748]  The polls show that people are at best apathetic to it all, and certainly in America, the majority just aren't buying it.
[00:36:09.449 --> 00:36:22.339]  So the global, the man-made global warming advocates are beginning to make more and more shrill and alarmist claims, and then coming in with more wilder solutions.
[00:36:23.779 --> 00:36:24.900]  Let me explain how this works.
[00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:31.066]  I was explaining earlier how if you have one political party it's easy to topple it.
[00:36:31.506 --> 00:36:32.367]  It can be pushed over.
[00:36:32.867 --> 00:36:37.471]  But if you have two big political parties or two supposedly different ideas
[00:36:38.743 --> 00:36:39.324]  We're good to go.
[00:36:55.077 --> 00:37:06.984]  And they would say, look at the Americans, they're for torture, look at the Americans, they're for secret arrest, look at the Americans, they're for attacking innocent countries, they lie about WMDs, and they're ignorant, they don't believe in global warming.
[00:37:07.604 --> 00:37:10.486]  And so because the Americans were wrong on all these other things,
[00:37:11.366 --> 00:37:12.066]  By design?
[00:37:12.267 --> 00:37:13.567]  Well, I'm not an ignorant American.
[00:37:14.327 --> 00:37:17.529]  I'll go ahead and support global warming, global tax.
[00:37:17.869 --> 00:37:20.410]  Those greedy Americans are too wasteful and pig-like.
[00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:21.471]  Well, that is true.
[00:37:21.511 --> 00:37:23.132]  We're wasteful pig-like SUVs.
[00:37:23.412 --> 00:37:26.173]  Doesn't mean we aren't wasting and doing some things that are bad and consumerist.
[00:37:26.513 --> 00:37:27.834]  So there's that idea in Europe.
[00:37:28.354 --> 00:37:33.255]  They don't see that it's about a tax and control, and so because George Bush was against it, they got behind it.
[00:37:33.655 --> 00:37:36.536]  As soon as Europe got behind it, Bush came out for it.
[00:37:36.936 --> 00:37:42.418]  And then we saw Pat Robertson go out on TV and say it's of the Lord, global tax, Jesus says do it.
[00:37:43.238 --> 00:37:49.980]  So again, another example how they play two sides off against each other that are really connected and run by the same group.
[00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:50.880]  Paul Watson, go ahead.
[00:37:52.443 --> 00:37:53.543]  Yeah, precisely.
[00:37:53.784 --> 00:38:00.126]  And then if, you know, if you speak out against man-made global warming propaganda, then you're called a tool of the oil companies.
[00:38:00.546 --> 00:38:20.494]  Well, go and take a look at who is actually promoting man-made global warming, and you will find that oil executives and people like British Petroleum's Peter Sutherland, the head there, are out meeting secretly and talking about pushing this false fear-mongering of global warming, and they're the ones doing it.
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:32.448]  And the end result is that, you know, the people on the left just don't look into who's pushing it, and they just think it's this neo-com lie to say anything against it.
[00:38:33.209 --> 00:38:40.574]  But the dangerous thing now is that, with the wilder claims, they're coming up with wilder solutions, which is what I wrote about on Monday.
[00:38:41.475 --> 00:38:49.701]  One of which is, there was an article out of the Guardian called, um, Geoengineering, the Radical Ideas to Combat Climate Change.
[00:38:50.638 --> 00:38:57.483]  And now, they're not just talking about this, because they've been doing it, and they've been doing it... They say, oh, we could spray the clouds.
[00:38:57.543 --> 00:39:00.925]  Turns out, these little buggers have actually been trying to heat things up.
[00:39:01.499 --> 00:39:03.681]  Yeah, and they've been doing it at the U.S.
[00:39:03.721 --> 00:39:13.648]  Department of Energy's Savannah River National Laboratory in South Carolina, conducting tests of spraying sulfur dioxide into the upper atmosphere.
[00:39:13.708 --> 00:39:16.390]  We need a big report about, you know, chemtrails exposed.
[00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:19.072]  This has been out for six months, Paul, still no story.
[00:39:19.492 --> 00:39:25.697]  I want a detailed story tomorrow if you can do it, about how they are chemtrailing, how every major research institute in the world is involved.
[00:39:26.757 --> 00:39:28.759]  Yeah, and I mean, twenty years ago,
[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:38.426]  We were all being told that the big environmental danger was something called acid rain, which was caused in part by factory and industrial emissions.
[00:39:39.145 --> 00:39:42.228]  And Alex, what's the main component of acid rain?
[00:39:42.788 --> 00:39:43.248]  Sulfur.
[00:39:43.709 --> 00:39:44.850]  Sulfur dioxide.
[00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:48.733]  And this is what they're saying they will go up and spray into the upper atmosphere.
[00:39:48.853 --> 00:39:50.774]  And aluminum oxide and barium.
[00:39:50.874 --> 00:39:52.936]  Everything the chemtrail researchers told us.
[00:39:53.397 --> 00:39:54.237]  I'm not kidding, folks.
[00:39:54.337 --> 00:39:55.899]  Thousands of U.S.
[00:39:55.959 --> 00:39:59.802]  universities, Canadian, British, every federal agency,
[00:40:00.422 --> 00:40:01.583]  Exactly, and it's being pushed by...
[00:40:18.556 --> 00:40:30.385]  People like Nobel Prize winner Paul Crutzen, who proposed sending jumbo jets up to dump huge quantities of sulfur particles into the far reaches of the stratosphere to cool down the atmosphere.
[00:40:30.465 --> 00:40:40.373]  And it turns out he did that in the late 80s, early 90s, and then he magically wins a Nobel Prize, and then the spraying starts, added to the fuel, so the pilots don't know.
[00:40:40.533 --> 00:40:41.614]  All compartmentalized.
[00:40:42.074 --> 00:40:46.097]  And what are the health effects of exposure to sulfur dioxide?
[00:40:46.681 --> 00:40:59.312]  Neurological effects and behavioral changes, disturbance of blood circulation, heart damage, reproductive failure, damage to immune systems, and there's a list that goes on and on.
[00:40:59.392 --> 00:41:00.753]  All of their favorites!
[00:41:00.953 --> 00:41:02.134]  All of their faves!
[00:41:02.595 --> 00:41:03.435]  Very tasty.
[00:41:05.683 --> 00:41:07.764]  But it's for the Earth, Paul!
[00:41:08.485 --> 00:41:09.606]  It's for the Earth!
[00:41:09.726 --> 00:41:10.927]  It's saving us!
[00:41:11.467 --> 00:41:16.771]  It causes, quote, substantial damage to the natural environment, according to the new scientists.
[00:41:16.991 --> 00:41:21.955]  So this is what, they want to damage the environment to save the environment.
[00:41:22.576 --> 00:41:25.738]  And the new thing is cut down all the trees because they create CO2.
[00:41:26.158 --> 00:41:27.299]  Oh yeah, trees are evil.
[00:41:27.339 --> 00:41:32.243]  They want to cut down beautiful, pristine, old-growth forests
[00:41:32.839 --> 00:41:39.881]  Because, um, as trees age, they, uh, start to take in less carbon dioxide and give it off.
[00:41:40.021 --> 00:41:48.825]  Now, again, scientifically, they know from psychology, and they say this, they say outrageous things to just shock you into going, fine.
[00:41:48.845 --> 00:41:49.985]  You know what I mean?
[00:41:50.005 --> 00:41:52.646]  That's why they come out with us and say, yes, we torture small children.
[00:41:53.046 --> 00:41:53.986]  It's the American way.
[00:41:54.246 --> 00:41:58.308]  That's meant to just shock the conscience till you finally just go, okay, fine.
[00:41:59.108 --> 00:42:01.669]  Right, which is now why the, uh,
[00:42:02.426 --> 00:42:26.204]  Prince Philip's World Wildlife Fund is saying that CO2 not only causes global warming, but it also causes global cooling, which is why whatever happens with the weather, and whether there's an earthquake or a hurricane, or whatever happens with the weather, it's all related to human-caused emissions, so humans are the problem.
[00:42:27.099 --> 00:42:40.087]  And again, this goes back to 10,000 years ago, 5,000 years ago, witch doctors saying, give us control of society, give us the best huts, the best temples, the best food, the best women, or the goblin god will eat the sun.
[00:42:40.567 --> 00:42:43.089]  Well, the priests were just marking down when there was going to be an eclipse.
[00:42:43.689 --> 00:42:44.590]  They knew what it was.
[00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:45.911]  The general public didn't.
[00:42:46.331 --> 00:42:51.434]  And so now it's suddenly global cooling and they have at a bunch of stores in Austin.
[00:42:51.955 --> 00:42:58.019]  I was at a steakhouse in Denver and it stunk because they have no flush toilets in the steakhouse.
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:02.582]  They had special parking spots for low emission cars.
[00:43:02.982 --> 00:43:05.864]  Again, Japan, England, the U.S.
[00:43:05.884 --> 00:43:11.067]  want to have stickers on the car that you have to have showing your carbon emission like yellow stars.
[00:43:11.508 --> 00:43:13.489]  I mean, this is social engineering, folks.
[00:43:15.529 --> 00:43:17.430]  Tell folks... In fact, I forgot to air it.
[00:43:18.310 --> 00:43:20.611]  Get that together about the Bend Police.
[00:43:21.031 --> 00:43:23.852]  Mainstream news in England reporting it like it's good.
[00:43:24.192 --> 00:43:25.272]  Tattle on your neighbors.
[00:43:25.352 --> 00:43:26.092]  See what they're doing.
[00:43:26.112 --> 00:43:30.933]  But see, after they get you done spying over trash, then it's what is your neighbor's political views.
[00:43:30.953 --> 00:43:34.754]  They always start it with something innocuous on spying, and then it moves on to everything else.
[00:43:34.774 --> 00:43:35.934]  Do you have that clip from yesterday?
[00:43:37.795 --> 00:43:38.075]  John?
[00:43:41.176 --> 00:43:41.716]  John, are you there?
[00:43:43.342 --> 00:43:46.883]  John, do you have the clip from yesterday?
[00:43:46.903 --> 00:43:47.984]  I want to play the rainwater clip.
[00:43:48.044 --> 00:43:49.204]  I may go into overdrive today.
[00:43:49.864 --> 00:43:54.866]  Do you have the clip about the trash can secret police?
[00:43:56.267 --> 00:43:57.467]  Oh, the neighborhood watch.
[00:43:57.607 --> 00:43:59.548]  Pull it up and tell me when you got it.
[00:43:59.848 --> 00:44:01.349]  Okay, go ahead, Paul.
[00:44:03.209 --> 00:44:09.892]  Yeah, we were talking about geoengineering and these radical solutions to solve a problem which doesn't exist.
[00:44:10.879 --> 00:44:19.601]  Climate change has happened throughout the eons, whether it's heating or cooling, and humans have had very little to do with it in every case.
[00:44:20.281 --> 00:44:31.364]  But now, I wrote an article on Monday, which I had to read it very carefully to make sure that what I was reading was actually true, and it was there in the article.
[00:44:32.004 --> 00:44:40.266]  But they're now proposing, and this is out of Stanford University, a guy called Professor Stephen Schneider,
[00:44:41.033 --> 00:44:45.916]  At a cost of $100 billion a year to the taxpayer.
[00:44:47.357 --> 00:45:00.185]  They're proposing to send out a fleet of spaceships and literally park them between the Earth and the Sun to form a giant artificial cloud to block out the Sun.
[00:45:01.826 --> 00:45:09.311]  And this is in the Guardian article that I referenced earlier, Geoengineering the Radical Ideas to Combat Climate Change.
[00:45:10.051 --> 00:45:22.896]  And the quote out of it is, scientists have suggested launching a constellation of free-flying craft that would sit between the Sun and the Earth, forming a cylindrical cloud around half the Earth's diameter and ten times longer.
[00:45:23.537 --> 00:45:29.619]  And this, they say, is to block out 2% of sunlight hitting the Earth.
[00:45:29.639 --> 00:45:32.780]  But I thought they said the Sun, Al Gore said, had nothing to do with heating.
[00:45:33.461 --> 00:45:39.203]  Oh yeah, yeah, they will say that the Sun has little to do with climate change and that it's CO2 emissions.
[00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:44.833]  But all these programs of geoengineering are based around blocking out the sun.
[00:45:45.054 --> 00:45:47.015]  And it all goes back to them playing God.
[00:45:47.035 --> 00:45:47.355]  Go ahead.
[00:45:48.096 --> 00:45:53.919]  Yeah, so I guess that that giant blazing ball of light in the sky has got something to do with climate change.
[00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:55.761]  Okay, let's play a few of these clips.
[00:45:56.341 --> 00:45:59.783]  We don't have time to play it all, but here's one clip about the Tattletail Squads.
[00:45:59.803 --> 00:46:01.484]  We now have these here in the US as well.
[00:46:01.524 --> 00:46:01.845]  Here it is.
[00:46:02.385 --> 00:46:03.686]  Are you naturally nosy?
[00:46:04.346 --> 00:46:06.007]  Do you consider yourself to be a snooper?
[00:46:06.508 --> 00:46:08.629]  Someone who likes to know what's going on in their street.
[00:46:09.312 --> 00:46:11.873]  Then you're wanted, but not for a crime.
[00:46:12.574 --> 00:46:17.777]  To uncover those close by who are not as environmentally minded as authorities think they could be.
[00:46:18.537 --> 00:46:23.120]  Adverts looking for so-called environment volunteers have been springing up around the country.
[00:46:24.498 --> 00:46:27.019]  Alright.
[00:46:27.079 --> 00:46:39.868]  And then you also have adverts in every major paper in England for kids to spy on their parents, fill out dossiers on them.
[00:46:40.848 --> 00:46:42.770]  You wear red and black uniforms.
[00:46:43.130 --> 00:46:44.411]  You're called climate cops.
[00:46:44.751 --> 00:46:46.572]  They're going to set that up here as well.
[00:46:46.612 --> 00:46:48.734]  They're building the whole Homeland Security apparatus.
[00:46:49.194 --> 00:46:53.517]  It's then going to be shifted into every one of you will have a caseworker who visits you weekly.
[00:46:53.817 --> 00:46:54.718]  This has all been announced.
[00:46:54.738 --> 00:46:55.499]  This will happen.
[00:46:56.119 --> 00:46:57.100]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:59.002]  You're not coming to my house, you dirty bastards.
[00:46:59.302 --> 00:47:00.123]  Stay out of my life.
[00:47:00.263 --> 00:47:01.224]  Every control freak.
[00:47:01.284 --> 00:47:04.527]  Nobody who could ever do anything in their life could ever make it.
[00:47:05.348 --> 00:47:08.131]  You know, controlling the arts and entertainment, just like East Germany.
[00:47:08.531 --> 00:47:09.892]  I mean, it is just going to be hellish.
[00:47:09.932 --> 00:47:14.036]  Now, here's another clip out of Utah telling you you can't collect rainwater.
[00:47:14.677 --> 00:47:17.299]  And then making it sound reasonable at the end of the newscast.
[00:47:17.319 --> 00:47:17.639]  Here it is.
[00:47:18.536 --> 00:47:20.217]  Who owns the rain?
[00:47:20.597 --> 00:47:21.818]  Turns out, not you.
[00:47:22.178 --> 00:47:27.802]  You're actually breaking the law if you try to capture rain falling under your roof and pour it on your flower bed.
[00:47:28.242 --> 00:47:32.625]  A prominent Utah car dealer found that out when he tried to do something good for the environment.
[00:47:32.845 --> 00:47:33.826]  Okay, stop right there.
[00:47:34.286 --> 00:47:37.068]  It's up on Infowars.com and presentplanet.com if you want to see it.
[00:47:37.088 --> 00:47:39.210]  But the bottom line is, it's the same sales tactic.
[00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:41.251]  We're doing this for your own good.
[00:47:41.652 --> 00:47:42.873]  We're doing this for the Earth.
[00:47:43.233 --> 00:47:46.275]  He was doing it for the environment, but it wasn't good enough.
[00:47:46.796 --> 00:47:51.699]  And at the end, he submitted to them, and they just explained that the government owns you.
[00:47:51.719 --> 00:47:56.123]  You know, that's why T. Boone Pickens is grabbing all those area for wind power.
[00:47:56.163 --> 00:47:58.805]  It's about the water under it, and it's a big scam.
[00:47:58.845 --> 00:48:01.467]  But he tells you it's for the environment, you'll go for it.
[00:48:02.267 --> 00:48:02.848]  Paul Watson.
[00:48:04.434 --> 00:48:24.760]  Well yeah, now you've got a situation in Britain, which I talked about last time I was on about this, where a guy allegedly, I stress allegedly, because he claims he didn't, but maybe he did, maybe he's evil, allegedly dropped an apple core when he was walking down the street, and he was subsequently
[00:48:25.989 --> 00:48:31.011]  Pursued by environmental snoops, who then called the regular police.
[00:48:31.091 --> 00:48:35.333]  He was handcuffed, arrested, and kept in a cell for about 12 hours.
[00:48:35.453 --> 00:48:36.613]  Yeah, this is total tyranny.
[00:48:36.773 --> 00:48:39.935]  And if you say the word homosexual, you're arrested in England, BBC reported.
[00:48:40.375 --> 00:48:43.636]  Again, hardcore super tyranny in your face.
[00:48:43.696 --> 00:48:44.196]  Go ahead, Paul.
[00:48:44.856 --> 00:48:53.820]  And there was another case where a woman and a young child had bought a sausage roll from a food stand and
[00:48:54.662 --> 00:49:03.010]  The mother was feeding it to her daughter and a tiny piece of the pastry dropped on the floor and immediately pigeons swooped down and ate it up.
[00:49:03.531 --> 00:49:12.240]  But it was this crime was spotted by an eagle-eyed environmental crimes unit official who came running across the street.
[00:49:12.922 --> 00:49:20.768]  And demanded the authority to fine this woman for dropping a tiny piece of pastry on the street.
[00:49:20.808 --> 00:49:28.993]  Now again, they're creating the Stasi force out of environmental wackos who don't care about cross-species, genetic engineering, GMO, you know, real crises.
[00:49:29.434 --> 00:49:32.256]  It's about maximum enforcement on the general public.
[00:49:32.596 --> 00:49:34.838]  You think it's bad with cops everywhere writing you tickets now?
[00:49:35.698 --> 00:49:37.500]  You know, ten times what it was decades ago.
[00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:39.662]  It's going to get hundreds of times worse.
[00:49:40.122 --> 00:49:41.904]  Every control freak, nobody in your face.
[00:49:42.244 --> 00:49:46.168]  We're going to talk behind the scenes in a minute, Paul, for the InfoWars.com audio streams.
[00:49:46.188 --> 00:49:55.236]  Before we end this segment and come back in a final segment with Aaron with some eugenics quotes that he didn't have in here earlier, I wanted to tell people about a cola blue.
[00:49:55.596 --> 00:49:56.978]  They tell you you can't have the water.
[00:49:58.581 --> 00:50:00.442]  They tell you that you can't collect rainwater?
[00:50:00.682 --> 00:50:01.103]  They tell you?
[00:50:01.143 --> 00:50:01.463]  You know what?
[00:50:01.803 --> 00:50:14.591]  It's totally legal, and even if it was, they can go to Hades, to go to acolablue.com, E-C-O-L-L-E-B-L-U-E, there's a big banner up on infowars.com, acolablue.com, get seven and a half gallons a day out of the atmosphere.
[00:50:15.638 --> 00:50:24.785]  Out of the air in your own home or out on your porch, and it makes seven and a half gallons, no sodium fluoride, them forcefully medicating you with a chemical weapon, none of that.
[00:50:25.446 --> 00:50:27.387]  Give them a call, 866-585-4044, 866-585-4044, acolablue.com, 866-585-4044, acolablue.
[00:50:38.717 --> 00:50:39.177]  You know what?
[00:50:39.437 --> 00:50:41.397]  I'll take rainwater out of the sky if I want.
[00:50:41.618 --> 00:50:42.058]  You know something?
[00:50:42.358 --> 00:50:43.778]  You better drill your wells now.
[00:50:43.858 --> 00:50:46.058]  Even in Texas, they're trying to ban having your own well.
[00:50:46.338 --> 00:50:47.479]  It'll be grandfathered in.
[00:50:47.739 --> 00:50:48.379]  They're coming.
[00:50:48.679 --> 00:50:49.379]  The scum.
[00:50:49.559 --> 00:50:51.159]  There's no jobs left in America.
[00:50:51.479 --> 00:50:54.080]  There's only cop and enforcer and bureaucratic jobs.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:56.580]  They're going to go from three million cops to ten million.
[00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:57.300]  They've announced it.
[00:50:57.540 --> 00:50:58.901]  They're going to run your life.
[00:50:58.981 --> 00:51:00.481]  It's going to get bad, folks.
[00:51:00.781 --> 00:51:01.761]  You think it's bad now?
[00:51:01.821 --> 00:51:02.821]  You ain't seen nothing.
[00:51:02.921 --> 00:51:03.561]  Terrorist storm.
[00:51:03.721 --> 00:51:04.542]  Alright, let me go to Paul.
[00:51:04.822 --> 00:51:05.702]  Paul, you've got three minutes.
[00:51:05.722 --> 00:51:06.862]  Any other topics you want to cover?
[00:51:09.356 --> 00:51:20.685]  I was going to add to that the fact that if you get a cadre of people who pick on innocent people for supposed crimes, then that only increases the real crime rate.
[00:51:21.085 --> 00:51:29.512]  There was a story today about a running street battle between Asian and black gangs in London.
[00:51:29.652 --> 00:51:32.494]  And this wasn't some, you know, hellhole.
[00:51:33.075 --> 00:51:36.918]  It was a posh area of London and they had a running street battle for 20 minutes.
[00:51:37.921 --> 00:51:40.082]  With no police showing up whatsoever.
[00:51:40.102 --> 00:51:50.809]  So you read stories about that, and then you read stories about mothers getting harassed and fined for dropping a piece of pastry on the floor by these environmental crime squads.
[00:51:50.829 --> 00:51:52.410]  Well, police files have been released.
[00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:54.431]  One time when the Chicago Police Chief slept up.
[00:51:56.453 --> 00:51:59.355]  When real stuff happens, the cops cower and protect themselves.
[00:51:59.695 --> 00:52:03.437]  But if it's beating up an old woman, they're going to be there on the spot, because that's easy.
[00:52:03.497 --> 00:52:05.879]  See, the fat cattle, that's us,
[00:52:07.116 --> 00:52:10.759]  Are to be bled and sucked off of, not the criminal element.
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:24.908]  That's right, and it's only going to increase when they devote more police time to more inane and stupid things that only target innocent people, such as, in this country at the moment, knife crime.
[00:52:25.369 --> 00:52:30.892]  There was a media scaremongering campaign about the increase in knife crime and people being stabbed.
[00:52:31.513 --> 00:52:32.854]  So what did the government do?
[00:52:33.536 --> 00:52:41.781]  They banned knives and now you get three years in jail simply for possessing a knife, you know, if you're not in your own house.
[00:52:42.341 --> 00:52:43.562]  What effect is that going to have?
[00:52:43.602 --> 00:52:46.544]  Well, it means that anybody who wants to defend themselves against
[00:52:47.105 --> 00:52:51.047]  Knife crime is not going to be able to carry a knife because criminals don't obey laws.
[00:52:51.607 --> 00:52:58.291]  And so your crime rate will totally explode when they catch a citizen with a knife to defend themselves, they'll throw the book at you.
[00:52:58.751 --> 00:53:05.174]  But in England they've already been caught and secret memos have come out on that to leave illegal aliens alone, to let them break the law.
[00:53:05.334 --> 00:53:07.595]  When they stab somebody, they'll let them go in a few weeks.
[00:53:08.576 --> 00:53:11.397]  Because they're there to menace you into submission.
[00:53:11.697 --> 00:53:13.198]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[00:53:14.679 --> 00:53:15.119]  That's right.
[00:53:17.025 --> 00:53:18.725]  Paul, I want a big Chemtrail report.
[00:53:18.765 --> 00:53:30.068]  I mean, we've got all this high-altitude aerosol spraying, all these universities admit they're doing it, they admit they're manipulating it, and it's exactly what all the Chemtrail researchers like Carnicom and others said when they did tests.
[00:53:30.108 --> 00:53:32.688]  It's not like we just guessed this and then it came true.
[00:53:33.308 --> 00:53:34.449]  We documented this.
[00:53:35.509 --> 00:53:39.810]  I think it'd be a big story, an important story, with a headline like, Chemtrail Mystery Solved.
[00:53:39.830 --> 00:53:42.911]  I think it'd be a supernova story, post a bunch of videos.
[00:53:43.371 --> 00:53:44.751]  I'd like to see that from you tomorrow, Paul.
[00:53:46.255 --> 00:53:48.616]  Yeah, I actually did a similar one back in April.
[00:53:48.636 --> 00:53:49.437]  Alright, thanks Alex.
[00:54:10.552 --> 00:54:13.694]  Final segment, ladies and gentlemen, two sponsors I want to tell you about.
[00:54:13.714 --> 00:54:19.899]  Well, one of them is Infowars.com video and bookstore online, where you get films like Fabled Enemies just out.
[00:54:19.919 --> 00:54:22.081]  You can order it now, now shipping, or watch it online.
[00:54:22.401 --> 00:54:26.324]  Super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv, burn disc of it, get it out to people.
[00:54:26.804 --> 00:54:31.688]  There's also E-Foods Direct, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful,
[00:54:33.424 --> 00:54:33.664]  I think?
[00:54:54.835 --> 00:54:57.416]  Police, state, depression, I hope none of it happens.
[00:54:57.837 --> 00:55:06.121]  But if there's a 10% chance of it happening, which there definitely is, why not have high-quality, storable foods that are freeze-dried and dehydrated, stored in very small areas?
[00:55:06.141 --> 00:55:09.943]  1-800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com.
[00:55:10.003 --> 00:55:16.127]  Giant banners at the top of infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[00:55:16.207 --> 00:55:20.129]  I really hope that you will take action on that.
[00:55:20.609 --> 00:55:23.431]  Also, when you're on infowars.com, be sure and check out
[00:55:24.372 --> 00:55:28.836]  The banners to the great folks at New Vitality.
[00:55:28.936 --> 00:55:41.466]  Hundreds of great, well-documented herbal remedies and vitamins and minerals and antioxidants and aloes, colon cleanse, very known for hundreds of years to clean out your guts, detoxify.
[00:55:41.966 --> 00:55:45.069]  They've got things like Super Beta Prostate, just a great line of products.
[00:55:45.089 --> 00:55:45.709]  Give them a call.
[00:55:45.729 --> 00:55:46.029]  1-800-569-4056.
[00:55:46.049 --> 00:55:46.109]  1-800-569-4056.
[00:55:52.334 --> 00:55:57.037]  Or you can also go to their website www.newvitality.com.
[00:55:57.357 --> 00:56:01.840]  If you forget that website, simply go to www.infowars.com.
[00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:04.721]  Now, everything's overkill here.
[00:56:05.161 --> 00:56:07.763]  And I told Aaron I wanted some of the quotes, and so he went out and got them.
[00:56:07.803 --> 00:56:09.504]  Now he has like 50 pages in his hands.
[00:56:09.544 --> 00:56:11.185]  We have about three minutes left here, Aaron.
[00:56:11.625 --> 00:56:14.927]  So, if you want to read a few globalist quotes about eugenics, go ahead.
[00:56:15.774 --> 00:56:17.675]  Alright, I'll start with Margaret Sanger.
[00:56:18.176 --> 00:56:22.839]  The most merciful thing a family does to one of its infant members is to kill it.
[00:56:23.719 --> 00:56:27.122]  That is reprinted in Woman and the New Race.
[00:56:28.002 --> 00:56:30.924]  Birth control must lead ultimately to a cleaner race.
[00:56:31.264 --> 00:56:35.027]  That's Margaret Sanger in Women, Morality, and Birth Control.
[00:56:37.694 --> 00:56:39.976]  Eugenics sterilization is an urgent need.
[00:56:40.036 --> 00:56:42.958]  We must prevent multiplication of this bad stock.
[00:56:43.479 --> 00:56:47.401]  Margaret Sanger, April 1933 Birth Control Review.
[00:56:48.082 --> 00:56:53.566]  Eugenics is the most adequate and thorough avenue to the solution of racial, political and social problems.
[00:56:54.147 --> 00:56:57.089]  Margaret Sanger, The Eugenic Value of Birth Control Propaganda.
[00:56:59.555 --> 00:57:07.384]  The campaign for birth control is not merely of eugenic value, but is practically identical with the final aims of eugenics.
[00:57:08.105 --> 00:57:11.028]  Margaret Singer, The Eugenic Value of Birth Control Propaganda.
[00:57:15.287 --> 00:57:18.730]  The marriage bed is the most degenerative influence in the social order.
[00:57:19.250 --> 00:57:20.751]  Margaret Sanger, the woman rebel.
[00:57:21.131 --> 00:57:26.875]  Yeah, so you wonder why all these big Rockefeller-funded people, and she was, were out getting rid of the family, get rid of this and that.
[00:57:26.976 --> 00:57:29.177]  It's not to empower women, it's to enslave you.
[00:57:29.617 --> 00:57:36.262]  And in all their internal documents, which are now published, these are university documents, it's about getting us all to be slaves.
[00:57:36.783 --> 00:57:37.843]  This is so cold-blooded.
[00:57:38.084 --> 00:57:41.646]  Meanwhile, you roll your sleeve up and trust what they shoot you full of?
[00:57:41.966 --> 00:57:42.307]  Go ahead.
[00:57:43.007 --> 00:57:49.612]  Give disgenic groups, people with bad genes, and our population their choice of segregation or compulsory sterilization.
[00:57:49.632 --> 00:57:51.994]  8 April 1932.
[00:57:52.575 --> 00:57:54.296]  And here's a quote about Margaret Sanger.
[00:57:54.336 --> 00:58:04.825]  As we celebrate the 100th birthday of Margaret Sanger, our outrageous and our courageous leader will probably find a number of areas in which we may find more about Margaret Sanger than we thought we wanted to know.
[00:58:05.345 --> 00:58:07.627]  Bay Waddleton, past president of Planned Parenthood.
[00:58:07.867 --> 00:58:08.808]  Alright, stop, stop.
[00:58:08.848 --> 00:58:10.771]  I know you've got hundreds of pages there.
[00:58:11.111 --> 00:58:16.758]  Tomorrow, sometime, maybe at the first of the show, 20 minutes with you, Aaron, to read more of these sickening eugenics quotes.
[00:58:17.579 --> 00:58:17.960]  Okay?
[00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:22.405]  Again, your liberal leaders want one thing, to kill you blacks and Hispanics.
[00:58:23.146 --> 00:58:25.747]  Your Republican leaders are there to neutralize whites.
[00:58:26.467 --> 00:58:27.588]  Wake up to the New World Order.
[00:58:27.868 --> 00:58:29.849]  I had a bunch of guests on, a ton of calls.
[00:58:30.329 --> 00:58:32.950]  I covered key info in the first hour.
[00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:37.592]  Key information on the eugenics program in the first hour today.
[00:58:37.652 --> 00:58:39.393]  Retransmission starts now, one place.
[00:58:39.753 --> 00:58:41.373]  InfoWars.com audio streams.
[00:58:41.593 --> 00:58:42.634]  Everybody else, God bless you.
[00:58:43.494 --> 00:58:45.255]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
