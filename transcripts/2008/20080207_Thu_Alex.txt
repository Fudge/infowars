[00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:09.792]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.472 --> 00:00:11.273]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:12.954]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.614 --> 00:00:17.196]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.797 --> 00:00:21.839]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.562 --> 00:00:33.404]  Oh, yeah.
[00:01:44.827 --> 00:01:46.548]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we're live.
[00:01:46.568 --> 00:01:49.390]  It is the seventh day of February 2008.
[00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.472]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:01:53.492 --> 00:01:57.594]  We're going to break down all the latest election news in the aftermath of Super Tuesday.
[00:01:57.634 --> 00:02:01.697]  We've now got the delegates, the numbers, who's in the lead, who's winning.
[00:02:02.197 --> 00:02:12.843]  Basically, the establishment has fielded a gaggle of New World Order insiders and is moving forward with a Hillary versus
[00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:23.908]  McCain ticket, both of them for open borders, both of them for gun control, both of them for endless wars, both of them for restrictions on free speech.
[00:02:24.328 --> 00:02:27.431]  And Bush says he's ready to back GOP nominee.
[00:02:27.791 --> 00:02:32.936]  McCain has widened his lead against Romney and others.
[00:02:33.056 --> 00:02:39.222]  Clinton is also leading right now against Barack Obama in the aftermath of Super Tuesday.
[00:02:40.327 --> 00:02:43.951]  They're saying that Romney is facing long odds for the nomination.
[00:02:44.011 --> 00:02:46.353]  The big question now is, what does Ron Paul do?
[00:02:46.734 --> 00:02:53.421]  LewRockwell.com, I think rightly so, is not calling for a broker convention, which we haven't had since the 50s.
[00:02:54.382 --> 00:03:01.910]  They are calling for a third-party run, so we'll be fleshing that out today and debating it as well.
[00:03:03.425 --> 00:03:07.608]  Also, on the Willie Nelson front, on Monday, of course, we interviewed Willie Nelson.
[00:03:08.048 --> 00:03:10.370]  He talked about 9-11 being an inside job.
[00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.452]  He talked about his fears of a dictatorship being set up in the United States.
[00:03:14.592 --> 00:03:21.116]  Now, the ultimate pinhead has called Willie Nelson a pinhead, and that's coming up in the next segment.
[00:03:21.156 --> 00:03:23.398]  Bill O'Reilly has gone after Bill.
[00:03:24.241 --> 00:03:28.024]  Willie Nelson for his interview here a couple days ago.
[00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:31.387]  Also, we have a large stack of important financial news.
[00:03:31.887 --> 00:03:37.512]  Pending home sales skid even more than expected as the recession deepens.
[00:03:37.532 --> 00:03:49.282]  The orchestrated recession by the central banks who are attempting to blow out the economy so they can consolidate real assets after flooding the global system with liquidity, credit, and currency.
[00:03:50.274 --> 00:03:54.556]  Stocks are wobbling also after retail sales report came out.
[00:03:54.676 --> 00:03:57.058]  Oil prices going back up.
[00:03:57.718 --> 00:04:02.981]  This is just some of what we're going to be discussing today here on the broadcast.
[00:04:03.341 --> 00:04:11.885]  Also Larry Nichols is in the Clinton Chronicles who worked with the Clintons when Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton were in the governorship.
[00:04:12.705 --> 00:04:17.428]  He's going to be joining us to give us his whole take on the Clinton crime machine.
[00:04:18.422 --> 00:04:18.862]  That's right.
[00:04:18.902 --> 00:04:21.624]  We are going to have either a Bush or a Clinton in the White House.
[00:04:22.104 --> 00:04:22.724]  Not just since 88.
[00:04:23.124 --> 00:04:24.385]  Everybody knows that Bush Sr.
[00:04:24.525 --> 00:04:27.766]  really ran the White House since Reagan was shot in 81 onward.
[00:04:28.047 --> 00:04:36.210]  So really from 81 until 2008, we have had a Bush or Clinton in the White House.
[00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.032]  Now we're looking at four to eight more years of that.
[00:04:39.092 --> 00:04:42.373]  It'll just be Clinton V, Bush IX.
[00:04:42.453 --> 00:04:44.554]  It'll be like two imperial dynasties.
[00:04:44.574 --> 00:04:45.795]  They'll probably intermarry.
[00:04:48.062 --> 00:04:51.284]  We'll just have that here in the United States with these staged elections.
[00:04:51.784 --> 00:04:56.705]  All right, all this and a lot more straight ahead after this quick break right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:04:57.286 --> 00:04:59.026]  InfoWars.com is the website.

[00:06:01.712 --> 00:06:03.093]  It is a big idea.
[00:06:03.113 --> 00:06:05.234]  A new world order.
[00:06:05.954 --> 00:06:11.238]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a power of government.
[00:06:11.318 --> 00:06:12.959]  It's known as the Bilderberg Effect.
[00:06:13.664 --> 00:06:15.887]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:06:16.448 --> 00:06:18.891]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:06:19.632 --> 00:06:26.961]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:06:29.955 --> 00:06:34.978]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:38.901]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:06:39.281 --> 00:06:41.803]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for the world government.
[00:06:41.863 --> 00:06:42.804]  Most people have no idea.
[00:06:42.824 --> 00:06:43.784]  They're not after money.
[00:06:43.804 --> 00:06:44.865]  They have all the money they need.
[00:06:45.065 --> 00:06:45.806]  They're after power.
[00:06:46.066 --> 00:06:47.187]  That's what they're after.

[00:06:55.892 --> 00:06:58.374]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:06:58.734 --> 00:06:59.755]  You have been warned.
[00:06:59.855 --> 00:07:00.736]  I think so.
[00:07:19.286 --> 00:07:22.848]  Experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[00:07:23.168 --> 00:07:29.150]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:32.932]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[00:07:33.192 --> 00:07:37.734]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[00:07:38.014 --> 00:07:38.794]  Do your part.
[00:07:39.054 --> 00:07:41.315]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!
[00:07:41.675 --> 00:07:47.798]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink
[00:07:48.018 --> 00:07:52.540]  It is Thursday, several days in the aftermath of Super Tuesday, and we now have a lot of the numbers on that.
[00:08:18.183 --> 00:08:18.863]  Who's ahead?
[00:08:19.203 --> 00:08:24.365]  Who is being positioned to be the anointed one for the nomination of the Republican Democratic Party?
[00:08:28.006 --> 00:08:35.628]  But right now, I want to go ahead and get into the latest development in the Willie Nelson story.
[00:08:35.648 --> 00:08:40.769]  For those that are just now joining us, on Monday we interviewed Willie Nelson for an hour.
[00:08:41.644 --> 00:08:51.351]  Here on air, and Mr. Nelson himself brought up the fact that he believed 9-11, the official story, to be a fraud.
[00:08:52.332 --> 00:08:58.977]  And he talked about how he had seen controlled demolitions in Las Vegas and how Tower 1 and 2 looked like they had been demoed.
[00:08:59.637 --> 00:09:09.024]  We then went into Building 7 that hadn't been hit by an aircraft, but that later that afternoon collapsed symmetrically into a nice little neat pile.
[00:09:09.597 --> 00:09:14.561]  Now we've interviewed firefighters and police and medical workers who said they heard a 20-second countdown.
[00:09:14.861 --> 00:09:17.283]  They were told to get back and that Building 7 was brought down.
[00:09:17.303 --> 00:09:24.468]  We even have CNN footage as you see the police saying, everybody get back, everybody get back at 5.30 in the afternoon.
[00:09:24.808 --> 00:09:27.910]  Amy Goodman is in the shot doing local New York news.
[00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:30.772]  She starts running and then you see Building 7 fall.
[00:09:33.177 --> 00:09:44.487]  Then, of course, Larry Silverstein, the owner of the complex, in a PBS documentary, America Rebuilds, said that they, quote, gave the order to pull the building and then watch the building come down.
[00:09:44.527 --> 00:09:47.670]  That is a demolition term in the industry.
[00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:51.253]  In the very same film, they cut to months later when they're demolishing
[00:09:52.330 --> 00:10:08.473]  Building 6, and they have explosives on the columns, and big cranes with cables to pull it the direction they want, when they blast the columns, and they say, getting ready to pull Building 6, when they were destroying the rest of the buildings in the complex, and they blow it up, and it falls over on its side.
[00:10:09.774 --> 00:10:11.334]  That's what pulling it means.
[00:10:12.574 --> 00:10:16.275]  And they continue to try to spin what happened there.
[00:10:16.755 --> 00:10:21.096]  Also, BBC, 25 minutes before Building 7 felled,
[00:10:23.817 --> 00:10:28.958]  ...reported that Building 7 had already fallen and gave the official line that later came out.
[00:10:29.278 --> 00:10:45.521]  They talked about how it collapsed totally into its own footprint, magically, with Building 7 in the background behind them, out the window, and then it turned out that another BBC channel, both BBC channels reported it, as well as CNN, so that's some false scripting.
[00:10:45.561 --> 00:10:48.062]  Kind of like with the Kennedy assassination,
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:11:13.390]  Hours before they'd even caught Lee Harvey Oswald, or anyone even knew his name here in the U.S., they had kind of had a false start with their news, and magically newspapers in New Zealand and other countries on the other side of the world were reporting that they had captured Lee Harvey Oswald before it had even been announced here that they were indeed looking for Lee Harvey Oswald.
[00:11:14.045 --> 00:11:14.606]  Same thing.
[00:11:15.046 --> 00:11:16.327]  They reported it a little bit early.
[00:11:16.727 --> 00:11:28.356]  So now, Bill O'Reilly, this is an individual who, of course, said he was for the Iraq War, now says that he wasn't for the Iraq War.
[00:11:28.796 --> 00:11:37.263]  This is an individual who is engaged in every form of yellow journalism, known under the sun to even call him a journalist, is comical.
[00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:44.883]  And he has this sophomoric section of his broadcast called Patriots in Pinheads.
[00:11:46.517 --> 00:11:50.942]  And he doesn't refute Willie Nelson talking about the buildings being controlled by militias.
[00:11:51.542 --> 00:11:53.724]  He doesn't refute any of the evidence of that.
[00:11:54.185 --> 00:12:04.755]  They also took out of context the comments he was making to where people watching on the internet and people commenting on the internet said, oh, Willie Nelson saying that no planes at Tower 1 or 2.
[00:12:05.416 --> 00:12:07.638]  No, Willie Nelson was talking about Building 7.
[00:12:08.726 --> 00:12:11.468]  And the government doesn't say that an aircraft hit Building 7.
[00:12:11.989 --> 00:12:13.310]  It's a separate building.
[00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:19.234]  It was a 47-story structure that collapsed into its own footprint that afternoon.
[00:12:20.115 --> 00:12:24.919]  So, here is Bill O'Reilly, then we'll decipher his propaganda here.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.983]  Today's The Patriots is next tonight, starring Willie Nelson and me!
[00:12:30.724 --> 00:12:31.164]  Uh-oh!
[00:12:31.925 --> 00:12:32.245]  Right back.
[00:12:39.895 --> 00:12:43.899]  Time now for Penn Ed and Patriots, I, your humble correspondent, and the Patriots tonight.
[00:12:44.139 --> 00:12:46.421]  I know that doesn't sound humble, but hear me out.
[00:12:46.901 --> 00:12:51.906]  For the past few years, the Scripps Howard News Agency has run an article where famous people picked the Super Bowl winner.
[00:12:51.966 --> 00:12:55.409]  Right now, I have the longest running streak in the country.
[00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:57.931]  Five straight picked correctly.
[00:12:58.011 --> 00:13:01.755]  So, in the Super Bowl predicting category, I'm a Patriot.
[00:13:02.135 --> 00:13:04.277]  I just wish I could pick political races as well.
[00:13:05.209 --> 00:13:08.452]  On the pinhead front, we are on the road again with Willie Nelson.
[00:13:08.612 --> 00:13:12.896]  The 74-year-old singer counts himself among the 9-11 conspiracy nuts.
[00:13:14.658 --> 00:13:15.859]  What's your take on 9-11?
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.701]  Do you question the official story?
[00:13:18.454 --> 00:13:24.437]  I certainly do, and I saw those towers fall, and I've seen an implosion in Las Vegas.
[00:13:25.178 --> 00:13:27.359]  There was too much similarity between the two.
[00:13:27.999 --> 00:13:29.520]  And I saw the building fall.
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:30.841]  It didn't get hit by nothing.
[00:13:30.881 --> 00:13:33.422]  So, you know, how naive are we?
[00:13:34.903 --> 00:13:36.304]  What do they think we'll go for?
[00:13:37.404 --> 00:13:38.105]  Good grief.
[00:13:38.605 --> 00:13:38.985]  Pinhead.
[00:13:41.062 --> 00:13:43.743]  So that's how deep his analysis gets.
[00:13:43.883 --> 00:13:49.304]  I mean, it's like something out of 1984 where they just put somebody's image on the screen and we have the two minutes of hate.
[00:13:50.144 --> 00:13:54.005]  He is a patriot, i.e.
[00:13:54.685 --> 00:14:02.687]  Bill O'Reilly, because he watches football and he's manly and he can predict who is going to win the Super Bowl.
[00:14:04.238 --> 00:14:14.427]  Willie Nelson, on the other hand, because he has the courage to make controversial statements and to come out and talk about a subject that the majority of Americans believe was an inside job, according to scientific polls.
[00:14:15.528 --> 00:14:16.208]  How dare him?
[00:14:16.789 --> 00:14:22.794]  How dare Willie Nelson have an opinion other than Bill O'Reilly's?
[00:14:23.214 --> 00:14:29.679]  And so it's boiled down to, Bill O'Reilly is a patriot, Willie Nelson is a pinhead.
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:31.521]  Well, at least
[00:14:34.376 --> 00:14:38.075]  At least Willie Nelson isn't sexually harassing his employees.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:46.365]  And at least he isn't, you know, calling up and trying to engage in dirty phone sex like Mr. Pervert, Mr. Fake Conservative Bill O'Reilly.
[00:14:46.385 --> 00:14:47.665]  I've just had enough of Bill O'Reilly.
[00:14:48.126 --> 00:15:03.735]  And one big reason is, is that if you look at him back when he was the producer of other TV programs, you ought to pull those up and play some of those today, he said that the government killed Kennedy, he did real reports, he laid out exactly who was involved in it, he talked about the New World Order, this is 15 years ago, 14 years ago,
[00:15:06.088 --> 00:15:08.949]  Uh, on Extra and Inside Edition and programs like that.
[00:15:09.369 --> 00:15:11.110]  And then now you look at Bill O'Reilly.
[00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:13.651]  He is a completely different individual.
[00:15:14.031 --> 00:15:16.432]  Here's the story from thejonesreport.com.
[00:15:16.592 --> 00:15:21.014]  O'Reilly calls Willie Nelson a pinhead for 9-11 remarks.
[00:15:21.454 --> 00:15:27.837]  O'Reilly launched an attack on country legend Willie Nelson last night in retaliation for bolstering support of 9-11 truth.
[00:15:28.157 --> 00:15:33.199]  But first, Bill O'Reilly took a moment to recognize himself as one of America's true patriots, a humble patriot,
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.542]  Well, because he called the Super Bowl five years straight.
[00:15:37.143 --> 00:15:44.508]  Never was there a truer example of Samuel Johnson's famous words, patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.
[00:15:44.909 --> 00:15:54.276]  While Willie Nelson, on the other hand, is labeled a pinhead for statements he made on the Alex Jones Show, where he claimed the tower's collapse resembled a Las Vegas demolition.
[00:15:54.776 --> 00:16:01.741]  Samuel Johnson also said of the true patriot, now listen to this, does this sound like Willie Nelson?
[00:16:02.302 --> 00:16:03.643]  Or does this sound like Bill O'Reilly?
[00:16:04.998 --> 00:16:14.580]  It is the quality of patriotism to be jealous and watchful, to observe all secret machinations, and to see public dangers at a distance.
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:24.802]  The true lover of his country is ready to communicate his fears and to sound the alarm whenever he perceives the approach of mischief by government.
[00:16:26.422 --> 00:16:28.963]  Now, does that sound... and that's what all the founding fathers said.
[00:16:29.823 --> 00:16:31.123]  That's what all the great statesmen said.
[00:16:32.245 --> 00:16:33.506]  Don't trust the government.
[00:16:33.726 --> 00:16:38.029]  It is a dangerous servant and a fearful master.
[00:16:38.149 --> 00:16:45.994]  Like fire, George Washington said, government is a dangerous servant and a fearful master.
[00:16:46.034 --> 00:16:48.396]  Read the Federalist Papers, read the Anti-Federalist Papers.
[00:16:49.317 --> 00:16:55.861]  It was about not trusting the government, being informed, being involved, keeping special interests from taking over your society.
[00:16:56.833 --> 00:17:04.001]  Now patriotism is mindlessly saying that you know how to call football final scores.
[00:17:04.161 --> 00:17:07.704]  That is the sum of a patriot because they've taken our heroes.
[00:17:07.724 --> 00:17:08.926]  They're not George Washington.
[00:17:09.426 --> 00:17:11.068]  They're not Benjamin Franklin.
[00:17:11.648 --> 00:17:12.109]  They're not
[00:17:13.075 --> 00:17:13.816]  We're good to go.
[00:17:29.579 --> 00:17:46.313]  They have turned this country into predominantly a group of people who aren't even dumbed down so much as they're experts on football scores and how to act cool and how to polish their cars and you know how to act trendy but not on how the world actually works so I want to get
[00:17:46.693 --> 00:17:52.097]  Your take on Bill O'Reilly at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:17:52.117 --> 00:17:52.877]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:17:52.897 --> 00:18:01.583]  But I am glad that hundreds of newspapers did carry the Associated Press article about Nelson on the show Monday.
[00:18:01.843 --> 00:18:04.945]  They carried that Tuesday and Wednesday, the last two days.
[00:18:05.546 --> 00:18:08.447]  And everything from Fox News to CNN has posted the story.
[00:18:08.848 --> 00:18:12.490]  AOL's front page, ABC News, has carried it as well.
[00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:13.551]  And so now,
[00:18:14.674 --> 00:18:28.591]  Not only is it the former German Defense Minister, or the former head of German Intelligence, or the former head of Italian Intelligence, or the former Italian President, or the Japanese Diet with the leader of Japan's second largest party,
[00:18:29.224 --> 00:18:38.149]  Going public on national television with a governmental investigation of 9-11 being staged by the military-industrial complex here in the United States.
[00:18:38.509 --> 00:18:45.113]  It's no longer just Bob Bair, who the movie Syriana was made about, the most highly decorated field CIA commander living.
[00:18:46.152 --> 00:18:53.595]  It's not just Bill Christensen, former CIA Section Chief in Europe, going public on this show saying he believes 9-11 is an inside job.
[00:18:53.815 --> 00:19:08.600]  It's not the thousands of architects and engineers and physicists and scientists and the head of an entire division of underwriting laboratories, Mr. Ryan, who went public and said we did internal tests, it's impossible that Building 7 felled.
[00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:12.261]  No, now it's Willie Nelson.
[00:19:12.864 --> 00:19:18.588]  It's not just Charlie Sheen or Martin Sheen, his father, that have gone public saying 9-11 is an inside job.
[00:19:18.928 --> 00:19:22.091]  We have an Angus and Reed Scientific Poll now from almost two years ago.
[00:19:22.351 --> 00:19:24.272]  The numbers just get better and better on our side.
[00:19:24.292 --> 00:19:27.334]  84% believe the government is lying about 9-11.
[00:19:28.775 --> 00:19:38.282]  The polls are as low as 36% believing the government carried out the attacks, and as high as 68% when plainly asked, do you believe the government was involved, saying yes.
[00:19:39.278 --> 00:19:40.579]  So we are the majority.
[00:19:40.619 --> 00:19:45.804]  Just like in the average poll, 85 plus percent of Americans believe the government killed Kennedy.
[00:19:46.986 --> 00:19:50.049]  The people don't buy your bull anymore, mainstream media.
[00:19:50.569 --> 00:20:00.639]  But tell you what, just keep on lying, keep on spinning, and you'll keep on hemorrhaging your market share, because everybody knows you're a pack of spinning liars for the military-industrial complex.
[00:20:02.941 --> 00:20:04.982]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:05.622 --> 00:20:14.546]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:14.986 --> 00:20:22.189]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:28.396]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:28.896 --> 00:20:39.727]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:40.488 --> 00:20:42.550]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:44.392]  For more information, call 702-953-7000.
[00:20:49.689 --> 00:20:56.493]  It is a big idea.
[00:20:56.993 --> 00:20:58.514]  A new world order.
[00:20:58.694 --> 00:21:07.399]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful government.
[00:21:08.239 --> 00:21:13.082]  It's known as the Builder Earth.
[00:21:13.382 --> 00:21:16.344]  Isn't their objective to be world domination?
[00:21:16.932 --> 00:21:19.376]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:21:20.117 --> 00:21:27.448]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:21:30.456 --> 00:21:35.439]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:39.382]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:21:39.762 --> 00:21:42.264]  Bill Burgess is making great progress for the world government.
[00:21:42.344 --> 00:21:43.485]  Most people have no idea.
[00:21:43.505 --> 00:21:44.245]  They're not after money.
[00:21:44.265 --> 00:21:45.366]  They have all the money they need.
[00:21:45.566 --> 00:21:46.287]  They're after power.
[00:21:46.547 --> 00:21:47.387]  That's what I have to do, sir.

[00:21:59.235 --> 00:22:00.236]  You have been warned.
[00:22:01.477 --> 00:22:03.338]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:22:03.478 --> 00:22:10.182]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:22:10.442 --> 00:22:18.607]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:22:18.827 --> 00:22:24.551]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:22:25.111 --> 00:22:25.271]  I think.

[00:24:33.811 --> 00:24:44.443]  We're back live, getting into some political news, and we'll go to your call for the next segment.
[00:24:45.664 --> 00:24:51.171]  Why a third party candidacy makes sense for Ron Paul from Blue Rockwell.
[00:24:52.339 --> 00:24:58.564]  Until Super Tuesday, many Ron Paul supporters believed his efforts to win the presidency were best served by remaining within the Republican Party.
[00:24:58.945 --> 00:25:05.570]  They believed the primaries would end in a brokered convention, from which Paul would emerge as the compromise candidate.
[00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:13.356]  Well, if you study brokered conventions, you need to just be a few percentage points behind the supposed leader.
[00:25:13.977 --> 00:25:19.201]  And even that is then demonized in the press when they had brokered conventions the last time back in the late 1940s.
[00:25:20.842 --> 00:25:27.744]  You can just go pull up the history of that, it's in any major political encyclopedia online, or you can go to the library, and I've actually looked into it.
[00:25:28.104 --> 00:25:33.265]  We're going to do some shows on Burger Conventions versus third party coming up in the next week or so.
[00:25:33.285 --> 00:25:40.047]  I know the poll campaign is split internally, but I happen to tell you, I can tell you, they are leaning towards third party run.
[00:25:40.968 --> 00:25:41.589]  It continues.
[00:25:41.929 --> 00:25:49.015]  Proponents of this scenario argue that Paul must remain Republican, for history tells us that third party candidates have no chance of winning the presidency.
[00:25:49.376 --> 00:25:53.699]  The results of Super Tuesday, however, tell us that Paul now has no chance of winning the GOP nomination.
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:26:01.867]  Even if frontrunner McCain doesn't lock up the nomination, a broker convention of neocon delegates will choose Joe Lieberman ahead of Ron Paul.
[00:26:02.427 --> 00:26:05.828]  Winning the GOP nomination would be a hollow victory anyhow.
[00:26:06.248 --> 00:26:10.950]  The party hierarchy has shown itself willing to undermine Paul's candidacy.
[00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:19.372]  The already faltering GOP fundraising machine would be unlikely to shower corporate donations upon a candidate who opposes pork on principle.
[00:26:19.772 --> 00:26:29.215]  And given that millions of Americans have become so outraged at this administration that they have sworn off voting Republican forever, the nomination could be more drag than lift.
[00:26:29.995 --> 00:26:31.936]  And he goes on to break down the fact that
[00:26:33.027 --> 00:26:37.470]  Ron Paul does have the grassroots machinery to get on the ballot.
[00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:38.771]  He can raise the money.
[00:26:39.492 --> 00:26:43.935]  And imagine Ron Paul, then, being in those national debates.
[00:26:44.855 --> 00:26:47.777]  Now that's why Bloomberg sees that both big parties are weak.
[00:26:47.837 --> 00:26:50.679]  That's why he's considering a third-party run.
[00:26:50.699 --> 00:26:52.801]  Now that does weaken Paul.
[00:26:54.491 --> 00:26:57.013]  We've had Kent Schneider, head of the Ron Paul campaign, on.
[00:26:57.033 --> 00:27:04.698]  He agrees a third-party run becomes weaker with a Bloomberg, but he agreed on air that a third-party run might be a good idea.
[00:27:04.718 --> 00:27:08.440]  We're going to have Ron Paul on, by the way, next week.
[00:27:08.621 --> 00:27:10.742]  That's being confirmed right now.
[00:27:10.762 --> 00:27:13.264]  We might even have him on tomorrow, but we'll see.
[00:27:13.284 --> 00:27:16.926]  He normally joins us about once a month.
[00:27:18.087 --> 00:27:19.768]  Again, a broker convention.
[00:27:20.008 --> 00:27:21.509]  People are saying, well, Ron Paul
[00:27:22.927 --> 00:27:26.810]  Supporters need to go in at all the state levels and flood the delegate post.
[00:27:27.551 --> 00:27:40.642]  But if Ron Paul's getting 5-10% of the vote, if he comes out with 60-70 delegates and the others have 500 apiece, imagine Ron Paul delegates trying to stand up and say, we're for Ron Paul.
[00:27:41.989 --> 00:27:51.257]  Back in the 40s when this last happened, when the candidate was just a few percentage points behind the supposed leader, the media talked about delegates trying to steal the election and foil the voters.
[00:27:51.757 --> 00:27:54.760]  And that's how they're going to frame this in the media.
[00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:56.181]  That's how they will push it.
[00:27:56.461 --> 00:28:05.349]  If Ron Paul's got 5-10% of the delegates, and we're not sure how that's going to end, but right now he's got about 5% of them, it's just not going to float.
[00:28:07.342 --> 00:28:09.083]  And I'm sorry I have to give people that news.
[00:28:09.643 --> 00:28:16.027]  I really think the campaign needs to very soon announce that they're going to run for a third party.
[00:28:17.167 --> 00:28:19.809]  The campaign is now, this is just facts, losing momentum.
[00:28:19.829 --> 00:28:22.410]  You can see the slowdown in the giving of money.
[00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:24.911]  You can see the slowdown in grassroots activity.
[00:28:25.792 --> 00:28:27.573]  I've gone and looked at all the big Ron Paul sites.
[00:28:27.613 --> 00:28:28.933]  Their traffic is down by about 60%.
[00:28:29.053 --> 00:28:31.895]  Some sites even more.
[00:28:33.095 --> 00:28:36.157]  And I can tell you, I've been doing this a long time, where this is going.
[00:28:37.006 --> 00:28:44.310]  And the longer he stays in as a Republican, the less time he has to re-energize the campaign by announcing a third-party candidacy.
[00:28:44.591 --> 00:29:03.722]  We can't wait to go into the convention and then hope that with, you know, 10% or less of the delegates that Ron Paul can then come in and with delegates infiltrating for other candidates' votes and claim any type
[00:29:04.422 --> 00:29:07.743]  Uh, of, uh, right to have a brokered convention.
[00:29:08.263 --> 00:29:16.745]  In fact, there's reports that it looks like Mitt Romney, if he continues to fall way behind McCain, that he can't even call for a brokered convention.
[00:29:16.765 --> 00:29:20.186]  But you watch, he'll probably end up being McCain's vice president, or something like that.
[00:29:20.866 --> 00:29:27.007]  Uh, so... But, you know, I know we're here in the Ron Paul bunker, and we're trying to command armies that don't exist.
[00:29:27.727 --> 00:29:28.947]  Uh, this just isn't gonna work.
[00:29:29.628 --> 00:29:30.808]  And that's just the facts.
[00:29:31.168 --> 00:29:31.228]  Uh...
[00:29:32.102 --> 00:29:33.603]  We'll see what the campaign does.
[00:29:33.763 --> 00:29:37.966]  I know they're trying to adjust and figure out their strategy right now, but they don't have time to wait.
[00:29:38.447 --> 00:29:47.313]  They need to, in the next few weeks, at least start hinting towards their grassroots system that there's a second half of this ballgame coming up.
[00:29:47.333 --> 00:29:49.875]  But you're welcome to debate that with me on the other side.
[00:29:49.895 --> 00:29:50.916]  We'll be right back with your phone calls.
[00:29:51.777 --> 00:29:52.737]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.158 --> 00:29:54.779]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:58.402]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.095 --> 00:30:03.595]  Hi neighbor.
[00:30:04.836 --> 00:30:06.557]  We all know that knowledge is power.
[00:30:06.977 --> 00:30:10.079]  We've tried to give you knowledge to help you prepare for rough times.
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:15.363]  There's the worldwide famine and our country's dependence on often dangerous food imports.
[00:30:16.003 --> 00:30:18.004]  You know about genetically poisoned food.
[00:30:18.525 --> 00:30:24.128]  Two-thirds of the food is disappearing with the bees along with huge crop failures from all-time record water shortages.
[00:30:24.829 --> 00:30:28.491]  You know they're turning food into fuel with corn ethanol plants.
[00:30:29.432 --> 00:30:33.153]  If we do not control our food, food will be used to control us.
[00:30:33.673 --> 00:30:38.815]  Food control has been the plan historically in every enslaved population and is the plan for America.
[00:30:39.495 --> 00:30:47.758]  The only value of the knowledge you have to take control of your food is if you choose to get a supply while you still have the freedom to choose.

[00:31:58.114 --> 00:31:59.615]  We're good to go.
[00:32:18.303 --> 00:32:18.523]  Thank you.

[00:32:41.841 --> 00:32:45.543]  The total cost for this massive package of information is only $10.
[00:32:45.863 --> 00:32:47.063]  $15 for UPS ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[00:33:11.034 --> 00:33:14.557]  It is Thursday, the seventh day of February 2008.
[00:33:16.799 --> 00:33:30.792]  The last segment, I was saying, looked for Mitt Romney to lose, that he was behind, that he couldn't even go for a broker convention, when he has hundreds and hundreds of more delegates than Ron Paul.
[00:33:31.913 --> 00:33:33.695]  Well, guess what just came out from CNN?
[00:33:36.511 --> 00:33:37.871]  Mitt Romney quits the race.
[00:33:37.891 --> 00:33:38.771]  We'll have to confirm this.
[00:33:38.811 --> 00:33:40.132]  I just got this during the break.
[00:33:40.952 --> 00:33:44.432]  CNN and various news agencies are reporting the presidential hopeful of the Republicans.
[00:33:44.472 --> 00:33:46.473]  Mitt Romney is bowing out of the race.
[00:33:46.513 --> 00:33:54.574]  CNN reports that the ex-governor of Massachusetts understands how to interpret numbers, and he has suspended his campaign, according to the CNN report.
[00:33:54.874 --> 00:33:58.455]  John McCain is speaking with Mitt Romney regarding this new development.
[00:33:58.475 --> 00:34:01.055]  In fact, that's too important.
[00:34:01.095 --> 00:34:03.216]  Let me just double-check this.
[00:34:03.276 --> 00:34:05.136]  Again, this news is coming in
[00:34:05.762 --> 00:34:08.023]  Fast and Furious here.
[00:34:11.504 --> 00:34:13.765]  Check the old Google for Mitt Romney.
[00:34:13.785 --> 00:34:23.928]  Right now they're reporting Romney faces long odds and bid to overtake a surging McCain.
[00:34:26.249 --> 00:34:29.349]  We will try to track this down and confirm that.
[00:34:29.410 --> 00:34:30.470]  Again, this just came in.
[00:34:34.332 --> 00:34:40.334]  This is not confirmed yet because the Guardian has reported that just 17 hours ago he was vowing to stay in the Republican race.
[00:34:40.654 --> 00:34:44.456]  But these guys usually do the opposite of what they say, so we'll confirm that.
[00:34:44.476 --> 00:34:49.917]  In fact, I know we have loaded phone lines, but after we take some calls, if you've indeed been seeing the news report this, let us know.
[00:34:49.957 --> 00:34:53.999]  I've got this here from CNN, but I want to, again, double confirm that.
[00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:58.640]  Now listen, I just don't want to be delusional here.
[00:34:59.281 --> 00:35:00.261]  I'm trying to be a realist.
[00:35:01.522 --> 00:35:07.324]  There have been brokered conventions, but the last time they had them in the 40s, the individuals who tried to have brokered conventions failed.
[00:35:07.364 --> 00:35:07.945]  They didn't get it.
[00:35:09.785 --> 00:35:13.207]  You have to have candidates that are neck and neck to have a brokered convention.
[00:35:13.827 --> 00:35:29.974]  There are people openly talking about having Ron Paul supporters show up and take over delegate positions and to hope that Mitt Romney or John McCain or Huckabee delegates don't show up and so then they'll be the delegate
[00:35:30.774 --> 00:35:31.755]  I can vote for Ron Paul.
[00:35:33.076 --> 00:35:35.098]  That politically looks like stealing votes.
[00:35:35.638 --> 00:35:38.481]  Exactly what Diebold machines have been doing in New Hampshire.
[00:35:39.041 --> 00:35:42.124]  Exactly what the mainstream media has been doing when Ron Paul wins Louisiana.
[00:35:42.344 --> 00:35:43.565]  They say he got second place.
[00:35:43.786 --> 00:35:47.829]  When he gets second place in Nevada, they just don't even show him and say McCain got it.
[00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:49.511]  That's what they're doing.
[00:35:50.572 --> 00:35:51.893]  That's what they're engaging in.
[00:35:54.787 --> 00:35:55.767]  I've looked at the poll numbers.
[00:35:55.867 --> 00:36:08.970]  If you really believe that Hillary was 13 to 20 points, depending on the poll, behind Barack Obama in New Hampshire, and then magically she won by more than 3 points, any way you cut it, that's more than a 15 point swing against the polls.
[00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:11.231]  We've never seen scientific polls be this wrong.
[00:36:11.691 --> 00:36:13.231]  They were always 2 to 4 points off.
[00:36:14.472 --> 00:36:15.152]  Plus or minus.
[00:36:16.432 --> 00:36:20.013]  So, all the spin doctors get up and explain to us why polls suddenly don't matter.
[00:36:20.533 --> 00:36:20.733]  Well,
[00:36:21.391 --> 00:36:32.918]  Speaking of polls, in major Gallup polls, 85% of Americans believe that the election process has been compromised fraudulently by these no-record, secretive, no-paper-trail voting systems.
[00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:38.942]  There is no doubt that Ron Paul has done much better than what has been shown.
[00:36:40.083 --> 00:36:43.245]  And there's no doubt that Hillary is less popular than Barack Obama.
[00:36:43.305 --> 00:36:44.666]  I know a lot of Democrats on the ground.
[00:36:44.686 --> 00:36:46.327]  I've been all over the country the last six months.
[00:36:46.407 --> 00:36:48.068]  I've done hundreds of interviews around the nation.
[00:36:48.846 --> 00:36:52.509]  Hillary Clinton is hated by many people in the Democratic Party.
[00:36:52.549 --> 00:36:54.430]  Barack Obama doesn't have all that baggage.
[00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:57.472]  He is clearly being cheated, and there's evidence of that, and it's come out in the press.
[00:36:57.953 --> 00:37:05.158]  Now remember, we fingered election fraud in Ohio in 2004, and election officials have gone to prison for that now.
[00:37:05.198 --> 00:37:05.838]  It's been confirmed.
[00:37:06.939 --> 00:37:09.180]  We don't just finger fraud where it doesn't exist.
[00:37:09.401 --> 00:37:18.307]  Bev Harris, who helped produce and vet the HBO documentary, Hacking Democracy, is very conservative about what she said, and she said, New Hampshire is clear fraud from pillar to post.
[00:37:18.914 --> 00:37:26.656]  She said New Hampshire, but the voting system there and the recount was, quote, a criminal enterprise.
[00:37:26.696 --> 00:37:29.557]  That is a quote from Bev Harris, and I agree with her.
[00:37:30.177 --> 00:37:33.078]  So, we need to now start pointing out that this is fraud riddled.
[00:37:33.638 --> 00:37:46.521]  Do you really believe Republicans, who universally, that I know, hate John McCain, do you really believe that this open border promoting, part of the Keating Five, gun control advocate,
[00:37:49.102 --> 00:37:53.126]  Do you really believe that he has beat out Huckabee and Mitt Romney?
[00:37:53.206 --> 00:37:55.949]  As bad as they are, they were better than John McCain.
[00:37:58.191 --> 00:38:04.917]  We have a big story up on PrisonPlanet.com today dealing with John McCain.
[00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:11.243]  Top cop says McCain was never tortured.
[00:38:13.184 --> 00:38:17.428]  And we go off the word of Jack McClain, the most highly decorated police officer in Phoenix, Arizona history.
[00:38:17.728 --> 00:38:23.193]  He was in black ops for more than seven years in Cambodia and surrounding nations.
[00:38:23.974 --> 00:38:25.595]  Had a top-secret clearance.
[00:38:25.715 --> 00:38:38.086]  He couldn't get into it on air, but he said that everybody knew that McCain, day one, was put in a special cell and taken to a hotel, lavished at dozens of propaganda films against the U.S., turned over all the secrets.
[00:38:38.686 --> 00:38:39.427]  Well, I don't need
[00:38:41.792 --> 00:38:45.914]  For Jack McClam, who I trust implicitly to tell me this, I've interviewed the veteran groups.
[00:38:45.934 --> 00:38:49.836]  I've interviewed people who were in the same camp as McCain when he was there for the first week.
[00:38:50.617 --> 00:38:52.517]  They've got their own websites and documented this.
[00:38:52.537 --> 00:38:59.001]  And by the way, the claims of Jack McClam from secret evidence is actually admitted.
[00:38:59.021 --> 00:39:03.203]  I've seen documentaries about McCain where he admits that he didn't break his arms from torture.
[00:39:03.243 --> 00:39:09.246]  He broke his arms ejecting and not putting his hands over his chest out of his fighter jet.
[00:39:11.035 --> 00:39:12.115]  When he landed in that lake.
[00:39:15.656 --> 00:39:20.097]  But there is media propaganda out there that McCain had his arms broken in torture.
[00:39:20.797 --> 00:39:24.718]  But that isn't even McCain lying, that's the media spinning and lying for it.
[00:39:25.398 --> 00:39:35.740]  This is the same media that told you Iraq had WMDs and yellowcake uranium and the aluminum tubes and the same media that is constantly saying that waterboarding isn't torture.
[00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:39.641]  But it is an important story that is up on
[00:39:40.282 --> 00:39:46.423]  PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:39:46.443 --> 00:39:51.764]  We've got a lot of callers here.
[00:39:51.844 --> 00:39:53.084]  Who is up first?
[00:39:57.805 --> 00:39:59.885]  Jeff in Indiana, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:39:59.905 --> 00:40:01.666]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[00:40:01.686 --> 00:40:02.886]  Good to talk to you, big fan.
[00:40:02.946 --> 00:40:03.726]  Good to talk to you too.
[00:40:04.286 --> 00:40:08.827]  I just wanted to say that I think this election has me really stirred up and really confused
[00:40:10.208 --> 00:40:13.451]  I'm thinking maybe we need a new approach.
[00:40:13.491 --> 00:40:18.374]  We need to do something more like what MLK and Gandhi did, for example.
[00:40:18.594 --> 00:40:27.100]  We need to just call for mass boycotts and just focus a lot of our energy on talking to people about the corrupt food system and medical system and start boycotting those.
[00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:29.061]  That's how MLK defeated the U.S.
[00:40:29.101 --> 00:40:29.401]  government.
[00:40:29.421 --> 00:40:31.603]  That's how Gandhi defeated the British.
[00:40:31.683 --> 00:40:33.144]  I wrote a book that I published.
[00:40:33.164 --> 00:40:34.225]  I'm not going to plug it here.
[00:40:34.245 --> 00:40:36.866]  I just want to say that the point of the whole book is 230 pages to show.
[00:40:38.516 --> 00:40:42.577]  That really the only way to defeat these people is through boycotting all the corporatist system.
[00:40:43.117 --> 00:40:44.237]  Well, go ahead and plug your book.
[00:40:44.277 --> 00:40:44.737]  I don't care.
[00:40:45.737 --> 00:40:47.998]  Oh, it's actually, it's advertised on Prison Planet.
[00:40:48.018 --> 00:40:48.898]  It's called Corporatism.
[00:40:50.038 --> 00:40:51.998]  The last name of the author of me is Grupp.
[00:40:53.079 --> 00:40:53.899]  Send me a copy of it.
[00:40:54.659 --> 00:40:55.659]  I think I did actually send you.
[00:40:55.679 --> 00:40:56.319]  I'll send you another one.
[00:40:56.339 --> 00:40:57.679]  I think I sent you one a couple months ago.
[00:40:57.979 --> 00:40:59.820]  I'm one of the regulars on Deagle's show.
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:07.001]  But anyway, I've just, with 230 pages of analysis, I've concluded that really the only way to
[00:41:07.737 --> 00:41:21.326]  I mean, they're going to cream us in these elections because they've got control of the Internet, they've got control of all these systems, and the only way we can beat them is really to go through means that are not in their control, which is just people power, grassroots power.
[00:41:21.346 --> 00:41:32.593]  I mean, we have to use the Internet and so forth, but we have to some way talk to person to person and start boycotting, because the whole system is controlled by money, and if we can take back the power
[00:41:34.288 --> 00:41:36.349]  I agree.
[00:41:36.429 --> 00:41:37.669]  I appreciate your call.
[00:41:39.749 --> 00:41:42.710]  Ten years ago, you couldn't find organic food in grocery stores.
[00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:49.631]  Now about a third of it, and in better grocery stores, most of it, is organic because people have been voting with their pocketbooks.
[00:41:49.651 --> 00:41:58.512]  If you don't like what Monsanto's doing with all this cross-species genetic-engineered food and the other big agri-companies, the biotech companies, stop buying it.
[00:41:59.493 --> 00:42:01.933]  Just five years ago, you couldn't find
[00:42:03.442 --> 00:42:13.851]  In major cities or small towns, organic milk that didn't have the bovine growth hormone in it that's making girls as young as three go into puberty.
[00:42:16.033 --> 00:42:17.314]  You couldn't find it in stores.
[00:42:17.454 --> 00:42:22.718]  Now, I go to mainline stores here in Austin, and you don't even hardly see the old milk.
[00:42:23.039 --> 00:42:31.686]  It'll be over in one little corner that's got the hormones in it, and then there'll be five, six different brands of the organic milk.
[00:42:33.402 --> 00:42:36.863]  Now the big corporates then come in and try to create fake certification groups.
[00:42:36.883 --> 00:42:48.168]  The feds passed a law two years ago where it can be 75% unorganic food products, and then they can still certify it as organic, but then consumer groups get wise to that and then create their own certification systems.
[00:42:48.428 --> 00:42:51.329]  And again, that's a microcosm of all of this.
[00:42:52.569 --> 00:42:54.570]  And so you're absolutely right, sir.
[00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:56.991]  Billy in New Jersey, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:42:58.031 --> 00:42:59.952]  Hi Alex, I spoke to you not too long ago.
[00:43:00.352 --> 00:43:01.853]  I have a question, but before I get to that,
[00:43:02.506 --> 00:43:04.246]  The New York Times has a breaking story.
[00:43:04.426 --> 00:43:06.787]  It says, Romney to quit presidential race.
[00:43:06.907 --> 00:43:08.087]  Yes, we have confirmed it.
[00:43:08.127 --> 00:43:09.248]  It's in the Associated Press.
[00:43:10.268 --> 00:43:10.608]  Oh, okay.
[00:43:10.628 --> 00:43:11.468]  It's also in the New York Times.
[00:43:11.488 --> 00:43:12.248]  Just want to let you know.
[00:43:13.389 --> 00:43:14.169]  But I have a question.
[00:43:14.489 --> 00:43:22.911]  I recently got a job at a bank as a bank teller, but every day to log in and log out, I have to scan my index finger using, what's the software called?
[00:43:22.951 --> 00:43:25.171]  I think it's called Bioscan 2.
[00:43:25.331 --> 00:43:26.232]  Maybe you could Google that.
[00:43:26.632 --> 00:43:31.993]  And I'm just wanting to know, I mean, I really don't want to keep the job, but should I quit solely based upon that?
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:34.501]  I appreciate your call.
[00:43:34.521 --> 00:43:36.142]  Let me answer your question when you're off air.
[00:43:37.343 --> 00:43:40.685]  My first film, America Destroyed by Design, I made in 1997.
[00:43:40.805 --> 00:43:43.087]  I really produced it in 96 into 97.
[00:43:45.088 --> 00:43:48.430]  And the last 20 minutes of the film gets into the executive orders.
[00:43:49.971 --> 00:43:57.537]  Clinton signed an executive order saying that if the states wanted their highway funds, they had to adopt federal standards.
[00:43:57.977 --> 00:43:59.818]  So we already had a national ID card by 1995.
[00:43:59.858 --> 00:44:00.859]  The states had adopted it.
[00:44:03.203 --> 00:44:17.645]  In 2000, they had a United Nations Summit, and the majority of nations in the world adopted global standards for biometric thumbprint, index fingerprint, digital photo for face scan identification, barcode, and scan script.
[00:44:19.286 --> 00:44:21.406]  And they have now put that into place.
[00:44:24.187 --> 00:44:32.408]  And so, in 2008, they're now telling us that we do indeed have federal standardized driver's license and ID cards, and they say you'll have to have it to have a job.
[00:44:34.343 --> 00:44:40.889]  Yes, but by the time they tell us we have a national ID card, we're eight plus years into it being a world ID card.
[00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:45.934]  The tanning salons to go in and if you have a membership, many of them thumbprint.
[00:44:48.136 --> 00:44:49.838]  The department stores to work at them.
[00:44:49.918 --> 00:44:52.240]  The grocery stores for four or five years now.
[00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:57.585]  Most of the big corporations are adopting this now to get into Disney World, you got a thumbprint.
[00:44:58.331 --> 00:45:04.574]  You gotta do a hand scan to get into the major theme parks like SeaWorld.
[00:45:04.974 --> 00:45:06.275]  That's for four years now.
[00:45:07.656 --> 00:45:13.078]  Most public schools make the children thumbprint or handprint to get their school lunches, no cash allowed.
[00:45:13.899 --> 00:45:16.940]  Most schools now have it to get into the library.
[00:45:17.601 --> 00:45:23.964]  Cameras in the bathrooms, cameras in the hallways, cameras in the classrooms, microphones, federally paid for, federally put in.
[00:45:26.005 --> 00:45:30.447]  They are now integrating it across the system, and they're going to have a national sales tax.
[00:45:31.007 --> 00:45:36.889]  That is going to be their excuse for federal authentication of all purchases.
[00:45:37.069 --> 00:45:41.471]  Now this is... I have seen Governor Ridge, when he was head of Homeland Security, say this on C-SPAN.
[00:45:41.731 --> 00:45:43.031]  I've seen it in the federal documents.
[00:45:43.912 --> 00:45:45.312]  Chertoff has now talked about it.
[00:45:46.673 --> 00:45:47.313]  They're doing it.
[00:45:47.933 --> 00:45:48.354]  Right now.
[00:45:49.534 --> 00:45:51.015]  And you say, well, what do I have to hide?
[00:45:51.035 --> 00:45:52.135]  You know, I'll go ahead and do that.
[00:45:53.962 --> 00:45:57.886]  They're having the fake conservative groups pitch it to us right now.
[00:45:59.407 --> 00:46:02.570]  Saying, oh, we're going to get rid of the income tax and have a national sales tax.
[00:46:02.650 --> 00:46:04.892]  No, they're going to keep both.
[00:46:06.053 --> 00:46:07.574]  They're just going to change the name of the IRS.
[00:46:07.594 --> 00:46:15.081]  They're going to have a 10 percent, this is so important, 10 percent quote social security tax.
[00:46:16.252 --> 00:46:22.895]  And then they're going to start it out at a graduated from 20 down to zero, depending on your income bracket.
[00:46:23.035 --> 00:46:28.036]  Because the argument against the sales tax is, the quote, fair taxes, well, the poor will be hit the hardest.
[00:46:28.056 --> 00:46:29.257]  They're saying, no, no, no, don't worry.
[00:46:29.957 --> 00:46:40.141]  If you make under $15,000 a year, and they're debating the number, $15,000 to $20,000 a year or less, you won't have to pay any sales tax but to stop fraud, because people will send folks in
[00:46:41.129 --> 00:47:07.681]  Who are in the lower bracket, and you're going to have to identify yourself and show what bracket you're in to not pay the tax, to see now if you're doing straw purchases for people, buying CD players, buying DVD players, computers, tractors, cars, clothes, food, cigarettes, alcohol, whatever the case may be, and going out and then selling it to people with the 15 to 20 percent sales tax not tagged on.
[00:47:09.016 --> 00:47:10.337]  This is how they're going to beguile you.
[00:47:10.417 --> 00:47:27.205]  Also, I saw six years ago, they have big corporate insurance meetings where the big heads of companies, the insurance companies, give them discounts if they adopt certain things, like drug testing all your employees, and then making your employees lose weight, or not allowing employees to smoke, even outside work.
[00:47:27.225 --> 00:47:33.568]  And it all sounds reasonable, but once that precedent's set, now we see internationally, international bodies lobbying here in the U.S.
[00:47:34.129 --> 00:47:36.810]  to, oh, don't let fat people come into restaurants.
[00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:38.611]  The feds are going to order
[00:47:39.853 --> 00:47:48.797]  The states are going to order, through the licensing of the restaurants that you thought was to keep salmonella off the counter and not to serve minors alcohol, sounded reasonable.
[00:47:49.517 --> 00:47:51.458]  They're now introducing legislation all across the country.
[00:47:51.498 --> 00:47:52.759]  Mississippi just did it this week.
[00:47:54.239 --> 00:48:05.284]  To where you will, as a restauranteur, if they look like they're overweight, come out with a tape measure and measure them and now see you're not paid by the feds or the states, but you have to go enforce that.
[00:48:05.564 --> 00:48:07.465]  Now a nanny social worker state.
[00:48:09.275 --> 00:48:16.476]  And so this total grid, tracking everything you buy, everything you do, total surveillance, you say, well, what do I have to hide?
[00:48:16.817 --> 00:48:18.177]  It's governments throughout history.
[00:48:18.357 --> 00:48:19.477]  Why are they hiding everything?
[00:48:19.517 --> 00:48:20.597]  Why are they so secretive?
[00:48:20.837 --> 00:48:22.298]  They're going to use this to control you.
[00:48:22.938 --> 00:48:24.718]  They're going to use this to jack up taxes.
[00:48:25.078 --> 00:48:31.780]  Once everything's tied to a national ID card, even if you're using cash, that's a cashless society, and there's no escape from this system.
[00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:38.301]  How did I predict exactly what was going to happen
[00:48:40.515 --> 00:48:41.496]  More than 10 years ago.
[00:48:43.417 --> 00:48:49.021]  How was I able to make my first film 11 years ago and lay out exactly what's going to happen?
[00:48:49.321 --> 00:48:50.582]  I had the executive orders.
[00:48:51.002 --> 00:48:52.283]  I had the corporate documents.
[00:48:53.044 --> 00:48:54.445]  And this just came out yesterday.
[00:48:54.485 --> 00:48:56.006]  I never got to it so I'll cover it now.
[00:48:56.526 --> 00:49:01.330]  DHS says real ID could be necessary for medicine.
[00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:08.394]  Now remember reading corporate documents where they get the Fortune 500 together and they say we want you to go ahead and implement this.
[00:49:08.414 --> 00:49:08.895]  Remember how
[00:49:09.941 --> 00:49:24.507]  The big drugstores, didn't matter who it was, didn't matter if it was Texas or California or New York, didn't matter which big chain it was, whether it was Eckards or Walgreens or Savon, did you notice how
[00:49:26.542 --> 00:49:37.151]  Going back about six, seven years, suddenly you'd go in to get some Sudafed or some type of antihistamine or some kind of cold medicine, and they said, oh, we're taking down your name and number and a copy of your driver's license and number.
[00:49:37.611 --> 00:49:38.332]  We have to look at it.
[00:49:38.352 --> 00:49:40.313]  And then suddenly the states all pass laws.
[00:49:40.373 --> 00:49:41.214]  Most states now have it.
[00:49:43.816 --> 00:49:49.681]  That was getting you ready to habitualize you to show your national ID card to buy and sell.
[00:49:50.822 --> 00:49:55.265]  Because everybody buys cold medicine a couple times a year, at least most people do, so you're being habitualized.
[00:49:55.285 --> 00:49:56.426]  Then it's cigarettes.
[00:49:56.486 --> 00:49:58.968]  Even I've seen 75-year-old women have to show ID.
[00:49:59.468 --> 00:50:03.711]  Or, even if you don't smoke, I've seen 50, 60, 70-year-old people have to show IDs.
[00:50:04.111 --> 00:50:06.653]  They just say, we card everyone when they buy beer.
[00:50:08.794 --> 00:50:10.135]  Now it's lighter fluid.
[00:50:10.315 --> 00:50:12.437]  Now it's, you see, it's everything.
[00:50:12.737 --> 00:50:15.739]  DHS says Real ID can be necessary for medicine.
[00:50:17.213 --> 00:50:29.216]  A top Homeland Security policymaker suggests that the recently released mandates for a de facto national ID card could help stop meth labs if the government required that pharmacies demand that the cold medicine buyers show their real ID.
[00:50:29.496 --> 00:50:34.097]  Now the feds are, not just the states, are going to be involved in your point of sale.
[00:50:35.837 --> 00:50:39.638]  Currently individuals who want to buy over-the-counter decongestants containing
[00:50:40.831 --> 00:50:42.554]  See how that magically happened in all 50 states?
[00:50:42.594 --> 00:50:43.715]  Warrior calls straight ahead.
[00:50:43.735 --> 00:50:44.156]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:50:44.176 --> 00:50:45.237]  InfoWars.com has been redesigned.
[00:50:45.257 --> 00:50:45.558]  Check it out.
[00:51:01.724 --> 00:51:14.429]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:51:14.869 --> 00:51:21.592]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[00:51:21.972 --> 00:51:25.554]  And the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:51:25.934 --> 00:51:29.136]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:51:29.336 --> 00:51:31.037]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[00:51:31.097 --> 00:51:36.840]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:51:42.643 --> 00:51:50.787]  While you're visiting the online video store, be sure to check out the huge discounts on films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, America, Freedom to Fascism, and
[00:51:55.490 --> 00:52:00.807]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[00:52:01.644 --> 00:52:03.505]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[00:52:03.705 --> 00:52:06.745]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[00:52:06.985 --> 00:52:11.607]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[00:52:11.947 --> 00:52:14.568]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[00:52:14.848 --> 00:52:21.689]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing that the major oil companies have run, yet they don't want you to know about them.
[00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:27.631]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[00:52:27.891 --> 00:52:29.612]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[00:52:30.032 --> 00:52:30.892]  SFR works
[00:52:32.551 --> 00:52:32.671]  That's 888!
[00:52:32.711 --> 00:52:33.091]  Use SFR1 today!
[00:53:02.193 --> 00:53:05.574]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:53:05.714 --> 00:53:10.916]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:53:11.117 --> 00:53:15.878]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:53:16.159 --> 00:53:27.283]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:53:27.583 --> 00:53:33.127]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:53:33.327 --> 00:53:39.432]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:53:39.632 --> 00:53:40.332]  What about you?
[00:53:40.573 --> 00:53:46.597]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[00:54:00.127 --> 00:54:03.530]  Big John.
[00:54:04.231 --> 00:54:07.293]  Big John.
[00:54:07.434 --> 00:54:09.996]  Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive.
[00:54:10.036 --> 00:54:12.858]  He stood six foot six and weighed 245.
[00:54:12.898 --> 00:54:15.440]  Kind of broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip.
[00:54:15.721 --> 00:54:19.023]  And everybody knew he didn't give no living to Big John.
[00:54:20.834 --> 00:54:29.957]  We're back live, continuing with your phone calls.
[00:54:31.197 --> 00:54:39.620]  I hope that you will take the last five minute breakdown that I gave you and give it to everybody on YouTube and LiveLeak and the rest of it.
[00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:42.280]  People need to know, this is all being put in by design.
[00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:46.102]  I've been telling you for more than ten years, exactly what I said would happen is happening.
[00:54:47.462 --> 00:54:49.183]  They have said it publicly.
[00:54:49.363 --> 00:54:50.463]  All I'm doing is repeating
[00:54:51.098 --> 00:54:51.438]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[00:54:51.458 --> 00:54:52.398]  Thank you for everything you do.
[00:55:19.955 --> 00:55:22.177]  I don't think so.
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:47.802]  His denial of 9-11, how much is that starting to come into, you were saying that he's starting to lose support.
[00:55:47.842 --> 00:55:51.643]  How much do you think that's got to do with losing his support, his denial of 9-11?
[00:55:52.503 --> 00:55:55.084]  I think it's a very small piece of it.
[00:55:55.724 --> 00:55:57.944]  Listen, I'm fully behind the campaign.
[00:55:57.964 --> 00:56:00.865]  I think he should have a third party run.
[00:56:02.266 --> 00:56:07.627]  I've looked at it carefully, and this broker convention is pretty much a pipe dream.
[00:56:09.295 --> 00:56:15.961]  I mean, he can't have 5-10% of the vote, and then go in there and have delegates come out and say they want Ron Paul.
[00:56:16.461 --> 00:56:20.084]  That's just not how it works, and that would be a PR disaster.
[00:56:20.565 --> 00:56:22.787]  Now, if he had 30% or something, that'd be different.
[00:56:23.827 --> 00:56:26.149]  I think we should all stay behind the campaign, keep promoting it.
[00:56:26.189 --> 00:56:29.152]  We've already won because we're getting the word out about liberty and freedom.
[00:56:29.172 --> 00:56:30.133]  Ron Paul is a wonderful
[00:56:31.013 --> 00:56:33.694]  Hey, just changing a little bit with this thing with Bill O'Reilly.
[00:56:55.295 --> 00:56:58.838]  Would you be willing to debate him on 9-11?
[00:56:58.938 --> 00:57:06.603]  I left a message for him, and I called him a coward, and he's always bragging how big he is.
[00:57:06.623 --> 00:57:08.324]  I think he says he's always six foot four.
[00:57:08.365 --> 00:57:10.886]  I heard that you're kind of a bodybuilder.
[00:57:11.146 --> 00:57:12.147]  I'm not a bodybuilder.
[00:57:12.567 --> 00:57:15.289]  Oh, that was on some deal where they said you were.
[00:57:15.550 --> 00:57:17.391]  But you look like you're put up pretty good anyway.
[00:57:17.936 --> 00:57:19.257]  I'm a little guy, I'm like 5'10".
[00:57:19.277 --> 00:57:28.183]  Listen, listen, I mean I gave up, my daddy's bigger than your daddy like 30 years ago, so I'm not, I mean it'd be an intellectual fight.
[00:57:28.764 --> 00:57:35.829]  Look, Fox News has set me up to be a guest about 10 times, and they've cancelled all but once, so I don't even really return their phone calls now.
[00:57:36.229 --> 00:57:41.333]  What happens is their underling producers want me on and the higher ups say no, Alex Jones is Prasada Nangrata.
[00:57:42.521 --> 00:57:44.983]  And look, Bill O'Reilly only has 3 million viewers.
[00:57:45.083 --> 00:57:46.604]  They're legends in their own mind.
[00:57:47.244 --> 00:57:49.926]  Medium-sized talk radio shows have 3 million listeners.
[00:57:50.727 --> 00:57:55.850]  So they're legends in their own minds, and I would go on Bill O'Reilly's show anytime, anyplace, anywhere.
[00:57:55.870 --> 00:58:05.897]  So why don't you have all your listeners just bombard Fox News and challenge them to have you on, say, for 15 or 20 minutes, not a two-minute little thing.
[00:58:07.068 --> 00:58:13.311]  And I even told them, I said, they could have their minion, Dennis Miller, on helping out O'Reilly, because I think he'd kick both their asses anyway.
[00:58:13.451 --> 00:58:15.552]  Well, I appreciate your call, sir, but you know what would happen?
[00:58:16.232 --> 00:58:19.933]  O'Reilly would turn the microphone off.
[00:58:21.894 --> 00:58:25.336]  Or, if he was in the studio with me, he would get up and menace and threaten.
[00:58:25.356 --> 00:58:26.216]  You know, he's done that before.
[00:58:26.596 --> 00:58:30.238]  He'll get up, I mean, it's just... But that's what his moron audience likes.
[00:58:30.258 --> 00:58:36.040]  You know, a bunch of people on Psychotropics who are 80 years old.
[00:58:36.773 --> 00:58:39.075]  So, I mean, the guy's got a zombie audience to begin with.
[00:58:43.179 --> 00:58:45.281]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.801 --> 00:58:49.104]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:57.832 --> 00:58:58.552]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.153 --> 00:59:00.214]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.915 --> 00:59:02.036]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.676 --> 00:59:03.477]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.244 --> 00:59:05.124]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.144 --> 00:59:09.445]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.985 --> 00:59:16.767]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:17.847 --> 00:59:22.588]  The cowardly bully who likes to bully women and guests physically on a show.
[00:59:22.608 --> 00:59:29.029]  A man who'll be remembered as a corporate government shill, Bill O'Reilly.
[00:59:30.070 --> 00:59:31.910]  Demonized Willie Nelson last night.
[00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:34.301]  Taking your calls about the election.
[00:59:34.321 --> 00:59:36.022]  Mitt Romney is stepping down.
[00:59:39.965 --> 00:59:43.027]  There is no doubt in my mind that there is massive fraud going on.
[00:59:43.047 --> 00:59:47.870]  I don't believe for a second that the country wants Hillary Clinton and John McCain.
[00:59:49.551 --> 00:59:51.473]  This is the establishment circling the wagons.
[00:59:51.513 --> 00:59:55.275]  They are almost identical on every policy, so you have no choice.
[00:59:55.295 --> 00:59:56.376]  They're both warmongers.
[00:59:59.033 --> 01:00:10.417]  And I've been telling you for what, since Hillary got into the Senate, for eight years, that it was going to be Hillary Clinton in after Bush had his stint.
[01:00:11.117 --> 01:00:12.017]  She's CIA.
[01:00:12.577 --> 01:00:14.958]  She was recruited with Clinton, her husband, around the same time.
[01:00:16.638 --> 01:00:17.939]  They vacation with the Bushes.
[01:00:18.039 --> 01:00:22.560]  Fox News has been financing them, having fundraisers for them, covertly, for at least six years.
[01:00:23.841 --> 01:00:28.122]  They are... The White House is helping write her speeches and advising her.
[01:00:28.894 --> 01:00:32.638]  This is the military-industrial complex just putting in their next agent.
[01:00:35.321 --> 01:00:37.823]  And all of that can be found in the mainstream news if you know where to look.
[01:00:37.843 --> 01:00:39.265]  A piece here, a piece there.
[01:00:40.767 --> 01:00:44.911]  Let's continue with your phone calls, and Larry Nichols, who can really tell you about the crimes of the Clintons, is coming up.
[01:00:47.053 --> 01:00:51.558]  It's time for conservatives and liberals to wake up and understand it's a rigged game, a rigged fight, a rigged horse race.
[01:00:54.673 --> 01:00:55.593]  Who's up next?
[01:00:55.673 --> 01:00:58.195]  Dan in Texas or is it Bill in Illinois?
[01:00:58.235 --> 01:00:59.855]  Bill in Illinois, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:00:59.875 --> 01:01:01.556]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:01:01.596 --> 01:01:02.236]  Good.
[01:01:02.396 --> 01:01:06.758]  First time I've called, I've listened to you for a long time, brought a lot of people to your show.
[01:01:06.838 --> 01:01:07.839]  Just a couple quick comments.
[01:01:07.879 --> 01:01:12.881]  First with Ron Paul, big supporter of Donated, but he's not going to address the boat fraud.
[01:01:13.421 --> 01:01:14.682]  I think we've all wasted our money.
[01:01:15.162 --> 01:01:22.525]  I mean, we had a pretty good idea he wasn't going to win because of this, but if he's not going to step up to the plate and start calling these people out, we're wasting our time.
[01:01:23.624 --> 01:01:30.271]  In second, on 9-11, and I've never had a chance to call your show before I tell you, but I was in the Navy, I was an operations specialist, I've been a radar operator.
[01:01:30.291 --> 01:01:34.495]  I've tracked aircraft, I've tracked ships, and I know how IFF works.
[01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:38.462]  Now, I've heard on your show how they superimpose things on the radars.
[01:01:38.922 --> 01:01:44.945]  And they would have to do that because if IFF drops, that does not wipe a contact off the radar.
[01:01:45.405 --> 01:01:47.066]  You can still track that contact.
[01:01:47.106 --> 01:01:49.988]  As a matter of fact... Yeah, but they told the public that you can track a bird.
[01:01:50.048 --> 01:01:53.409]  They told the public, oh, they all dropped off because they turned off their beacons.
[01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:58.472]  And now it's admitted that they superimposed at sometimes more than 40 blips.
[01:01:58.992 --> 01:02:03.753]  Generally about 20 blips over it, and you hear the operators going, is this part of the exercise?
[01:02:04.033 --> 01:02:06.473]  I've never seen so much real world during an exercise.
[01:02:06.854 --> 01:02:08.274]  Yeah, it's absolutely ridiculous.
[01:02:08.294 --> 01:02:09.194]  There's no way it could happen.
[01:02:09.214 --> 01:02:17.015]  It would be easier to track, because you would have course, speed, and the flight number above all of these other contacts, except for this one that's information that just dumped.
[01:02:17.316 --> 01:02:20.136]  And it would be an instantly, it would, an instantly would raise an alarm.
[01:02:20.216 --> 01:02:20.936]  It would stand out.
[01:02:20.996 --> 01:02:22.457]  What is going on with this flight?
[01:02:22.517 --> 01:02:24.817]  Why did his IFF codes just drop?
[01:02:25.057 --> 01:02:26.278]  It would stand out like a sore thumb?
[01:02:26.539 --> 01:02:27.379]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:28.240]  Absolutely.
[01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:29.602]  You would be able to track that thing.
[01:02:30.022 --> 01:02:32.424]  I could track it right now when I've been out for 13 years.
[01:02:32.725 --> 01:02:33.686]  It'd be a piece of cake.
[01:02:34.106 --> 01:02:40.032]  There is no way these guys, professional air traffic controllers, could not track a contact that lost its IFF drop.
[01:02:40.272 --> 01:02:41.574]  It would still paint on the radar.
[01:02:41.814 --> 01:02:42.735]  It would still be there.
[01:02:42.815 --> 01:02:43.916]  It's not going anywhere.
[01:02:44.376 --> 01:02:45.858]  And they're flying around for over an hour.
[01:02:46.747 --> 01:02:47.728]  Yeah, that's what I mean.
[01:02:48.209 --> 01:02:57.177]  That's why I mean, you know, long before... Yeah, I mean, you know, you're a smart guy and you've woken a lot of guys up, but I knew that day when I was sitting there watching it, I was like, this is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen!
[01:02:57.197 --> 01:02:58.839]  It's ridiculous!
[01:02:59.059 --> 01:03:05.125]  You know, so... Oh, and I don't know if you've seen the thing on the judge report where they're swabbing people's mouths at traffic stops now looking for serial killers.
[01:03:06.097 --> 01:03:13.140]  Well, I mean, they've been sucking blood out of people's arms from Arizona to Colorado to Texas randomly for at least eight years.
[01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:15.000]  This is all part of the police state.
[01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:16.281]  The border stays wide open.
[01:03:16.661 --> 01:03:17.921]  Enforcement against illegals.
[01:03:17.941 --> 01:03:20.602]  They're ordered to not arrest them for no driver's license when they're drunk.
[01:03:21.143 --> 01:03:21.883]  No insurance.
[01:03:23.123 --> 01:03:25.284]  Ordered to give them bank accounts with no ID.
[01:03:25.624 --> 01:03:27.405]  But citizens, you're going to be lined up.
[01:03:28.030 --> 01:03:30.751]  Guys in black uniforms are going to march back and forth in front of you.
[01:03:30.771 --> 01:03:33.192]  You're going to learn how to be a slave, present your papers.
[01:03:33.653 --> 01:03:44.117]  And 26,000 preachers, it's now public, I told you a year before it happened, before it came out, have been recruited to tell their flocks to turn their guns in, go to FEMA camps, take forced inoculations.
[01:03:45.338 --> 01:03:47.239]  And they'll probably just pass the baton to Hillary.
[01:03:48.119 --> 01:03:51.981]  They'll have an inaugural terror attack they stage, and it'll be pure dictatorship.
[01:03:53.686 --> 01:03:59.511]  Hey ladies, if you love to shop, then visit HerbalHealer.com to browse through their online catalog.

[01:04:49.787 --> 01:04:52.408]  Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[01:04:53.681 --> 01:04:55.343]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:04:55.663 --> 01:04:59.186]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:04:59.286 --> 01:05:01.228]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:05:01.248 --> 01:05:04.491]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:05:04.832 --> 01:05:10.317]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:05:10.617 --> 01:05:14.561]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:05:14.861 --> 01:05:19.806]  In the Infowar, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[01:05:20.086 --> 01:05:22.868]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:40.264]  My weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews and
[01:05:42.193 --> 01:05:50.197]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on Earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[01:06:02.703 --> 01:06:08.389]  At HempUSA.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the US and Canada.
[01:06:08.689 --> 01:06:15.296]  At HempUSA.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[01:06:15.796 --> 01:06:19.100]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:21.402]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[01:06:58.104 --> 01:06:58.825]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.405 --> 01:07:00.546]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:01.186 --> 01:07:02.307]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.947 --> 01:07:03.767]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.508 --> 01:07:05.508]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:06.069 --> 01:07:10.051]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.271 --> 01:07:14.353]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:17.157 --> 01:07:21.642]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[01:07:21.682 --> 01:07:25.765]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:07:41.377 --> 01:07:46.744]  Larry Nichols is an individual who has just had such an amazing life.
[01:07:47.525 --> 01:07:52.171]  He was with the Mujahideen for two years in Afghanistan doing some interesting work.
[01:07:52.511 --> 01:07:53.693]  He's going to talk about that later.
[01:07:54.965 --> 01:08:07.791]  He talked to Nouri al-Maliki, the Prime Minister of Iran, a while back during the attempted Gulf of Tonkin II they tried to stage with those fake radio transmissions.
[01:08:08.072 --> 01:08:09.412]  The media later admitted they were fake.
[01:08:09.772 --> 01:08:12.274]  It was a fraud that the Iranians didn't threaten to blow up the ship.
[01:08:12.294 --> 01:08:12.974]  It's just made up.
[01:08:12.994 --> 01:08:16.976]  And we're going to have him talk about that later in the second half of this hour.
[01:08:17.734 --> 01:08:17.974]  Well, Alex,
[01:08:45.770 --> 01:08:57.179]  First off, thank you for having me on, and I apologize for not being on with you for a few years, but for years I worked for the government.
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:03.244]  I was with the Contras in Nicaragua, Afghanistan,
[01:09:04.645 --> 01:09:11.526]  Then I got in with the Stevens Group in Arkansas, which is the largest investment group outside of Wall Street.
[01:09:11.666 --> 01:09:12.667]  Well, let's go back, though.
[01:09:12.687 --> 01:09:21.449]  Let's go back to... Larry, you haven't talked a lot about... Now, who were you working for back when you were in Afghanistan and Nicaragua?
[01:09:22.789 --> 01:09:23.449]  The CIA.
[01:09:24.169 --> 01:09:25.569]  And what was your position there?
[01:09:26.770 --> 01:09:27.630]  Well, you trained.
[01:09:29.230 --> 01:09:29.890]  Trained people.
[01:09:29.970 --> 01:09:30.650]  Trained fighters.
[01:09:31.251 --> 01:09:32.751]  When were you first recruited in the CIA?
[01:09:33.905 --> 01:09:34.625]  From Vietnam.
[01:09:34.645 --> 01:09:36.326]  Oh Lord, Alex.
[01:09:36.346 --> 01:09:37.186]  I was Green Beret in Vietnam.
[01:10:04.847 --> 01:10:15.711]  Then we were kicked out of Vietnam for cutting up the little Vietnamese when we killed them, because when you cut them up in little pieces, they didn't get to go to Buddha Heaven.
[01:10:15.731 --> 01:10:19.853]  And when they didn't get to go to Buddha Heaven, well then they wouldn't fight you.
[01:10:21.433 --> 01:10:28.196]  Well, the people didn't like that kind of rule, so they kicked us out.
[01:10:28.956 --> 01:10:31.537]  Then they turned and offered most of us muck work.
[01:10:31.857 --> 01:10:34.799]  From there I went to Rwanda against Idi Amin.
[01:10:35.719 --> 01:10:36.880]  From there to the Conga.
[01:10:38.921 --> 01:10:47.385]  And I guess just about every war in the world, Alex, anybody's war, I was in.
[01:10:49.926 --> 01:10:57.670]  And then Reagan called with a guy back during the Contras, right when Ali North
[01:10:58.399 --> 01:10:59.079]  Got in trouble.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.582]  There was a guy named Jack Zinglaub that I have worked with for years.
[01:11:05.083 --> 01:11:11.187]  And, uh, so anyway, he called and they needed a little help, so I went down there.
[01:11:12.908 --> 01:11:17.351]  And it was down there, Alex, that Nicaragua was different.
[01:11:18.971 --> 01:11:21.053]  My average soldier was 13 to 16 years old.
[01:11:25.785 --> 01:11:28.826]  And we were up against 500,000 Sandinos.
[01:11:31.767 --> 01:11:43.312]  And there you would go, but two hours later I'd hop on a Flying Tiger, or Southern Air, and I'd be back in America.
[01:11:45.333 --> 01:11:53.116]  And the transition of being in battle, and then being back here, that quick fried my brain.
[01:11:54.835 --> 01:11:59.819]  Now, I had known Bill Clinton and Hillary since I got them elected the first time.
[01:12:01.681 --> 01:12:09.567]  And so, my parents, my family, thought it was time for me to get out of the racket of running around and fighting.
[01:12:10.808 --> 01:12:16.192]  And so they said, why don't you call your friend Bill Clinton and get him to give you a job?
[01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:19.355]  So, by fried your brain, you got what they'd call PTSD?
[01:12:19.375 --> 01:12:19.515]  Yeah.
[01:12:22.484 --> 01:12:24.105]  And so I called Bill.
[01:12:24.165 --> 01:12:26.066]  Bill said, well, I've got a perfect place for it.
[01:12:26.086 --> 01:12:28.667]  It's called the Arkansas Development Finance Authority.
[01:12:28.927 --> 01:12:35.350]  And he knew you were good because, according to Terry Reid and others, Bill had been in intelligence quite a while, hadn't he?
[01:12:36.050 --> 01:12:36.791]  Oh, yeah.
[01:12:37.191 --> 01:12:38.471]  They all knew about me.
[01:12:40.012 --> 01:12:43.694]  I had done a lot of dirty work here for him.
[01:12:43.714 --> 01:12:50.537]  I mean, anybody that got in Bill's way, we eliminated.
[01:12:52.318 --> 01:12:52.918]  We got rid of him.
[01:12:54.279 --> 01:12:55.941]  Wow, you're going far today, Larry.
[01:12:55.961 --> 01:12:58.743]  I mean, I've been interviewing you for like 12 years off and on.
[01:12:59.623 --> 01:13:01.785]  By eliminated, what would happen to him?
[01:13:01.805 --> 01:13:05.007]  You mean arms, legs, head cut off and they'd report it was a suicide?
[01:13:06.348 --> 01:13:08.209]  It depended on what they deserved.
[01:13:10.551 --> 01:13:16.095]  Larry Patterson, Roger Perry and I, we would do whatever we were asked to do.
[01:13:16.275 --> 01:13:21.339]  Somebody got in our way, Bill screwed somebody, some farmer's daughter, and he was going to go public.
[01:13:22.409 --> 01:13:23.570]  He had two choices.
[01:13:25.331 --> 01:13:30.234]  Shut up, or, you know, hey, deal with it.
[01:13:33.757 --> 01:13:38.060]  So they put me at this place called the Arkansas Development Finance Authority.
[01:13:39.681 --> 01:13:43.824]  Nobody had ever heard of it, and I'd been around government for years.
[01:13:45.325 --> 01:13:46.626]  And if you remember from
[01:13:47.253 --> 01:13:52.836]  From the Clinton Chronicles, you remember the former Supreme Court Justice, Justice Jim Johnson.
[01:13:53.877 --> 01:13:55.478]  What an incredible man.
[01:13:55.498 --> 01:13:59.880]  He testified to all of this on the Clinton Chronicles.
[01:14:02.482 --> 01:14:04.723]  And I go there to this place.
[01:14:06.229 --> 01:14:12.213]  Thinking that they made low interest loans to schools and churches and low interest bond loans.
[01:14:12.553 --> 01:14:13.474]  I mean you were a killer.
[01:14:13.494 --> 01:14:20.558]  You've been killing for decades for this government and you knew that people played dirty but you still thought it was overall for something good at the end?
[01:14:20.578 --> 01:14:24.140]  It's what you did for money Alex.
[01:14:24.981 --> 01:14:26.302]  So you didn't even think it was good?
[01:14:27.242 --> 01:14:27.843]  I didn't care.
[01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:29.421]  Well, you know what?
[01:14:30.021 --> 01:14:37.806]  Folks have heard the whitewater and the rest of it, and we're going to tell that and get into the new, what's happening today, your bottom line on Hillary and McCain staging this whole deal.
[01:14:38.126 --> 01:14:39.267]  That's what's most important.
[01:14:39.587 --> 01:14:41.328]  And then into the Iran situation.
[01:14:41.369 --> 01:14:42.529]  We're really honored to have you, Larry.
[01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:44.651]  But then I want to talk about the mindset.
[01:14:45.631 --> 01:14:47.052]  Why are you doing this now?
[01:14:47.072 --> 01:14:52.656]  I mean, now you come across pretty credibly, and your info's always checked out, and you've hurt the Clintons bad.
[01:14:52.696 --> 01:14:56.819]  I mean, if you were doing it for money and being evil before, when did you decide to be a good guy?
[01:14:57.594 --> 01:15:07.439]  When I went to the Arkansas Development Finance Authority, remember, I had just been in a battle in the Bucca, right along the Rio Coco.
[01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:12.521]  And we had attacked the diamond mine.
[01:15:12.681 --> 01:15:18.404]  Adolfo Calero had sent me in to attack the diamond mine in the Bucca.
[01:15:22.006 --> 01:15:24.487]  And it was a little girl, about nine years old,
[01:15:26.178 --> 01:15:41.303]  And in that particular battle, what would happen when a battle was coming, Alex, people, the peasants, or campesinos, would move to enclaves, where they'd be safe from the battles.
[01:15:43.484 --> 01:15:48.966]  Well, this little girl and her mother were, uh, they didn't make it to the enclave.
[01:15:50.747 --> 01:15:52.047]  Well, they had a twin fifty.
[01:15:53.168 --> 01:15:54.188]  Blew her mother in the goo.
[01:15:56.556 --> 01:16:00.737]  And I ran and picked her up, pulled her over a log, and told her she'd be okay.
[01:16:02.817 --> 01:16:11.939]  And I was looking at the little girl, and I looked down, and her eyes went cold, and her bottom half had been blown off.
[01:16:15.339 --> 01:16:17.420]  And Alex had a daughter, Chelsea.
[01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:19.620]  Chelsea and Beth played together.
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:24.041]  I mean, they were the same age as this little girl.
[01:16:27.205 --> 01:16:28.266]  And my brain fried.
[01:16:29.587 --> 01:16:30.427]  I mean, I went nuts.
[01:16:32.348 --> 01:16:39.293]  So I came back, I go over to this place called the Arkansas Development Finance Authority, right, thinking I'm going to be the marketing director.
[01:16:41.214 --> 01:16:44.076]  Lo and behold, what do I find out?
[01:16:45.497 --> 01:16:54.143]  Adolfo Calero calls me, and you remember who Adolfo, the big guy with Ronald Reagan, the big white haired guy, the head of the Contras.
[01:16:55.686 --> 01:16:58.008]  He called me and he said, we've got a problem.
[01:16:58.088 --> 01:16:58.948]  I said, what is it?
[01:16:59.669 --> 01:17:04.913]  He said, we're hearing that we're smuggling cocaine through a place called Mina, Arkansas.
[01:17:04.933 --> 01:17:09.116]  I said, well, that's nuts.
[01:17:09.176 --> 01:17:11.157]  He said, well, would you go down and check it out?
[01:17:13.279 --> 01:17:18.022]  Well, I ran with Bill Clinton, Dan Laster, Webb Hubble.
[01:17:18.042 --> 01:17:22.886]  I mean, you name them, we were all buddies.
[01:17:25.925 --> 01:17:47.042]  And come to find out, Dan Laster was running, with Barry Thiel, a hundred million a month in cocaine through this little airport called MENA, which was a refurbishing center for the CIA, where they changed out planes from one theater to another.
[01:17:49.303 --> 01:17:54.968]  And Alex, it was that day when I went home, cried like a baby,
[01:17:57.625 --> 01:18:00.987]  And I thought, what if Beth got hooked on cocaine?
[01:18:04.488 --> 01:18:05.669]  How could I live with myself?
[01:18:07.790 --> 01:18:09.270]  And that's when I made my mistake.
[01:18:10.331 --> 01:18:17.694]  I went to Bill Clinton, told Bill what I had found out, that he had made a mistake.
[01:18:19.255 --> 01:18:19.996]  Now, I didn't know.
[01:18:20.076 --> 01:18:22.877]  See, Jack Stevens was my mentor.
[01:18:24.421 --> 01:18:26.122]  I mean, he would pick me up.
[01:18:26.262 --> 01:18:26.883]  Larry, stay there.
[01:18:26.903 --> 01:18:27.503]  We've got to go to break.
[01:18:27.523 --> 01:18:28.544]  We'll come right back with this.
[01:18:28.564 --> 01:18:32.626]  We're going to go to the history of the Clintons, and then you always said she'd be president.
[01:18:32.646 --> 01:18:34.967]  I remember in 2000, you said, watch 2008.
[01:18:35.488 --> 01:18:39.010]  And again, Larry Nichols is who he says he is.
[01:18:39.030 --> 01:18:40.751]  It's all been vetted by the national media.
[01:18:41.551 --> 01:18:44.273]  CIA, the whole nine yards, CIA commando.
[01:18:46.154 --> 01:18:50.517]  And I've heard the story so much, so many times from special forces colonels and the rest of it.
[01:18:50.857 --> 01:18:52.778]  It's the murdering children that changes them.
[01:18:53.792 --> 01:18:55.193]  It is a big idea.
[01:18:55.213 --> 01:18:57.315]  A new world order.
[01:18:58.035 --> 01:19:02.078]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:19:02.098 --> 01:19:05.721]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:19:05.761 --> 01:19:08.003]  Won't their objective be world domination?
[01:19:08.543 --> 01:19:11.005]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:19:11.726 --> 01:19:19.072]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:19:22.071 --> 01:19:27.495]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:19:27.535 --> 01:19:31.017]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:19:31.377 --> 01:19:33.899]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for the world government.
[01:19:33.959 --> 01:19:35.100]  Most people have no idea.
[01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:35.880]  They're not after money.
[01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:36.981]  They have all the money they need.
[01:19:37.181 --> 01:19:37.922]  They're after power.
[01:19:38.162 --> 01:19:39.283]  That's what I have to use it for.

[01:19:50.850 --> 01:19:51.871]  You have been warned.
[01:19:52.751 --> 01:19:58.395]  Now that we are in the midst of the presidential primaries, Republican candidate Ron Paul needs our support more than ever.
[01:19:58.795 --> 01:20:04.778]  Ron Paul stands for the issues that need to be addressed and not glossed over and forgotten like the globalist crowd being fielded.
[01:20:05.138 --> 01:20:11.462]  Unlike other candidates, Ron Paul takes a stand to follow what our forefathers envisioned America to be through the Constitution.
[01:20:11.482 --> 01:20:18.586]  Dr. Paul will restore sound money, eliminate the IRS, prevent the NAU, get us back to our constitutional roots.
[01:20:18.906 --> 01:20:19.527]  We're good to go.
[01:20:40.942 --> 01:20:45.306]  Go to RonPaulStickers.com and help get the word out about Ron Paul.
[01:20:45.666 --> 01:20:47.048]  This is our chance, America.
[01:20:47.328 --> 01:20:47.888]  Stand up.
[01:20:48.289 --> 01:20:49.470]  Now is the time to act.
[01:20:52.381 --> 01:20:54.923]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.

[01:21:00.866 --> 01:21:02.087]  The late, great USA.
[01:21:02.347 --> 01:21:03.748]  America, freedom to fascism.

[01:22:49.885 --> 01:22:58.347]  Larry Nichols is our guest.
[01:22:58.387 --> 01:23:01.088]  He's the guy that brought out all the big scandals on the Clintons.
[01:23:01.368 --> 01:23:03.068]  He knows them like the back of his hand.
[01:23:03.608 --> 01:23:10.670]  The mainstream media, from 60 Minutes to CBS, CNN, they've all gone over them with a fine-tooth comb, and it's all checked out.
[01:23:11.470 --> 01:23:11.990]  We've interviewed
[01:23:13.695 --> 01:23:20.738]  Well, as a matter of fact, if you go to Terry Reid's book, he writes in his book when he and I finally met, that he had never looked in the eyes of such a cold-blooded killer.
[01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:48.964]  Now folks, if you think I'm here telling you I'm a good guy, you're bad and wrong.
[01:23:51.105 --> 01:23:53.987]  There ain't nothing I haven't done.
[01:23:54.928 --> 01:23:55.268]  Twice.
[01:23:55.288 --> 01:23:58.790]  So do you understand that?
[01:24:01.312 --> 01:24:10.077]  But when I found out that they were smuggling cocaine, I went to Bill, and I said, Bill, you're smuggling cocaine and I can't have any part of that.
[01:24:10.177 --> 01:24:11.578]  You made a mistake about me.
[01:24:11.678 --> 01:24:12.619]  I'll do anything.
[01:24:13.223 --> 01:24:16.584]  I'll beat people up, break their arms or their legs, whatever.
[01:24:18.144 --> 01:24:22.045]  But I will not participate in trafficking cocaine.
[01:24:23.465 --> 01:24:27.806]  And that's when I got Dan Lester and Bill Clinton's brother put in prison.
[01:24:31.586 --> 01:24:35.087]  My mentor, Jack Stevens, I thought would protect me.
[01:24:36.787 --> 01:24:41.788]  I did not know that Jack Stevens and his brother, Whit Stevens,
[01:24:43.752 --> 01:24:46.694]  We're the head of the Dixie Mafia.
[01:24:48.055 --> 01:24:51.978]  So all this time, Alex, I had been working for the mob.
[01:24:53.979 --> 01:24:54.920]  And didn't even know it.
[01:24:56.961 --> 01:25:02.425]  Well, the Dixie Mafia is bigger than La Cosa Nostra in the U.S., and they keep it very quiet, don't they?
[01:25:03.245 --> 01:25:06.748]  Well, you ask anybody that you know in law enforcement.
[01:25:08.749 --> 01:25:12.592]  Pick any mob group you want to know, and they'll tell you there's no more vicious
[01:25:17.371 --> 01:25:22.254]  Well, here I go, and I come out, and I tell Lou, you got two weeks to tell the truth or I will.
[01:25:24.276 --> 01:25:32.141]  Next thing I know, I read in the paper, Bill, well, first off, then I find out my dad's dying of cancer.
[01:25:34.003 --> 01:25:40.627]  Well, then, it comes out in the paper that a state employee, this is all documented folks,
[01:25:42.337 --> 01:25:46.120]  A state employee was fighting for the Congress.
[01:25:48.461 --> 01:25:52.404]  And for six months, the media just had a field day with me.
[01:25:52.644 --> 01:25:54.045]  So they were destroying your character?
[01:25:54.305 --> 01:25:56.487]  Destroying my character, which I deserve!
[01:25:56.707 --> 01:25:57.547]  And blowing your cover?
[01:25:58.208 --> 01:25:58.828]  Blowing it?
[01:25:58.928 --> 01:26:00.309]  Hey, look, I deserved it.
[01:26:01.570 --> 01:26:03.071]  I deserve everything I get.
[01:26:05.553 --> 01:26:06.873]  January the 16th, 1989, I was sitting
[01:26:09.938 --> 01:26:11.839]  In the chair I'm sitting in right now.
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:15.861]  Daddy was dying of lung cancer.
[01:26:17.602 --> 01:26:22.945]  People would walk plumb across the other side of the street in this town.
[01:26:24.685 --> 01:26:26.366]  Do not even have to be near me.
[01:26:28.507 --> 01:26:31.029]  The neighbors wouldn't let their children play with my daughter.
[01:26:31.129 --> 01:26:33.430]  See, they thought I was a mild-mannered businessman.
[01:26:36.551 --> 01:26:39.433]  And I reached out, touched the floor,
[01:26:41.471 --> 01:26:46.352]  And I said, God can't get any lower than I am.
[01:26:49.933 --> 01:26:53.774]  So, uh, you know, I'm at the bottom.
[01:26:54.934 --> 01:26:55.775]  I don't know what to do.
[01:26:57.455 --> 01:27:02.356]  Now, I'm not going to tell you, I'm not going to tell any of you, you know, he burned a bush.
[01:27:03.977 --> 01:27:09.498]  Matter of fact, I wanted him to run something across screen, you know, scroll something across the bottom of the screen, telling me what to do.
[01:27:11.178 --> 01:27:11.598]  He didn't.
[01:27:12.059 --> 01:27:14.261]  The next morning I woke up and I knew what to do.
[01:27:15.482 --> 01:27:16.643]  And that was to tell the truth.
[01:27:19.265 --> 01:27:22.868]  But now to fight him, you had to be careful because these people would kill you.
[01:27:24.009 --> 01:27:37.920]  You know, I lost 52 witnesses that I had scheduled to testify to Ken Starr and to all the others that died of suicides.
[01:27:39.002 --> 01:27:42.163]  Shot themselves in the back of the head with 30-inch shotguns.
[01:27:45.924 --> 01:27:58.628]  And so, what I did, there was one thing I knew about, that everybody in Arkansas knew about, but nobody knew about it like I did, because I had had to cover it up so much.
[01:27:59.729 --> 01:28:01.049]  And that was a bill with his women.
[01:28:02.729 --> 01:28:07.171]  And I knew he was running for president, so I knew if I could just stay alive, Alex,
[01:28:08.658 --> 01:28:16.963]  If I could keep the mob from killing me, until he announced he was running for president, then the national media would just swarm in here.
[01:28:18.184 --> 01:28:20.986]  And man, I'd just show them all the women that he'd been screwing.
[01:28:22.827 --> 01:28:25.529]  You know, because remember of old Hart, Gary Hart.
[01:28:26.910 --> 01:28:27.610]  And it'd be over.
[01:28:28.491 --> 01:28:29.572]  Larry Nichols, stay there.
[01:28:29.652 --> 01:28:30.792]  Long segment coming up.
[01:28:30.852 --> 01:28:32.033]  I want to bring it up to date.
[01:28:33.234 --> 01:28:34.695]  The whole history and then up to date.
[01:28:34.715 --> 01:28:36.156]  He'll be with us into the next hour.
[01:28:37.808 --> 01:28:39.230]  Right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:43.955 --> 01:28:44.896]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.356 --> 01:28:46.978]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.899 --> 01:28:50.602]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.042 --> 01:28:55.884]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:28:56.024 --> 01:29:01.209]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:29:01.369 --> 01:29:02.730]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:29:02.991 --> 01:29:11.158]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:29:11.398 --> 01:29:17.124]  Hear how Heart and Body Extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:29:17.284 --> 01:29:19.046]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:29:19.126 --> 01:29:21.288]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:29:21.308 --> 01:29:25.672]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:29:25.832 --> 01:29:27.934]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:29:28.074 --> 01:29:35.821]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:29:36.021 --> 01:29:36.421]  We're good.
[01:29:53.454 --> 01:29:54.114]  It's a fact.
[01:29:54.334 --> 01:30:01.797]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[01:30:01.917 --> 01:30:10.800]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[01:30:11.060 --> 01:30:21.604]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:30:21.864 --> 01:30:27.927]  We can terminate your unsecure debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[01:30:28.147 --> 01:30:33.169]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[01:30:33.349 --> 01:30:37.832]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[01:30:37.992 --> 01:30:39.792]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[01:30:39.852 --> 01:30:40.133]  That's 877-943-8600.
[01:30:40.153 --> 01:30:40.553]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[01:30:40.653 --> 01:30:42.534]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[01:30:49.717 --> 01:30:51.578]  We're good to go.
[01:31:11.488 --> 01:31:12.229]  We're good to go.
[01:31:26.305 --> 01:31:26.785]  We're good to go!
[01:31:59.939 --> 01:32:01.760]  Larry Nichols joins us from Arkansas.
[01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:07.922]  He's the guy that blew open Whitewater, Sexgate, all of it, and the Clinton Chronicles and other films.
[01:32:08.582 --> 01:32:14.263]  People that would see Clinton with Jennifer Flowers would have their legs and arms broken by the state troopers.
[01:32:17.524 --> 01:32:19.905]  The Clinton death list began to rise.
[01:32:19.945 --> 01:32:21.865]  We've gotten up to that point, Larry Nichols.
[01:32:21.905 --> 01:32:22.626]  Continue, please.
[01:32:24.935 --> 01:32:26.876]  I stayed alive, kept it going.
[01:32:27.557 --> 01:32:30.358]  He announced, so I break Jennifer Flowers.
[01:32:30.979 --> 01:32:31.979]  Well, nobody believed me.
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.422]  They had already used the Stevens.
[01:32:36.782 --> 01:32:50.830]  You see, back then, Alex, people didn't believe that the media, the national media, was controlled in those days by about 50 different corporations.
[01:32:51.310 --> 01:32:51.871]  Now it's five.
[01:32:54.673 --> 01:32:56.034]  They had already gotten to them.
[01:32:57.115 --> 01:33:04.321]  And so the national media would come in, check me out like a, you know, like whatever.
[01:33:04.341 --> 01:33:07.204]  Then they'd find out it's true.
[01:33:08.104 --> 01:33:12.148]  The reporters would go back just with stories they could not believe.
[01:33:12.989 --> 01:33:15.951]  And the editors would spike them, would let them run.
[01:33:17.893 --> 01:33:21.456]  But then there was a guy from Star Magazine.
[01:33:22.159 --> 01:33:25.701]  Stephen Edwards left a little card in my mailbox.
[01:33:26.461 --> 01:33:30.663]  He said, I believe there's more to your story than what's been told.
[01:33:32.644 --> 01:33:34.145]  And so that's when it started.
[01:33:34.245 --> 01:33:35.425]  I told him the story.
[01:33:36.406 --> 01:33:38.307]  We broke it in Star Magazine.
[01:33:39.187 --> 01:33:39.928]  They denied it.
[01:33:39.968 --> 01:33:43.949]  Now, most of y'all will remember this.
[01:33:43.970 --> 01:33:45.590]  To show you how far back I go.
[01:33:47.771 --> 01:33:49.032]  It was during the Super Bowl.
[01:33:51.351 --> 01:33:53.773]  And I was there with Steve Kauf.
[01:33:55.013 --> 01:33:58.415]  And there was Bill and Hillary during the Super Bowl.
[01:33:58.956 --> 01:34:03.899]  And that was when Hillary said she wasn't just baking cookies like, you know, Tammy Wynette.
[01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:08.421]  Well, they denied Jennifer Plowers.
[01:34:10.122 --> 01:34:12.744]  Well, then I broke the story about Paul Jones.
[01:34:14.645 --> 01:34:15.746]  And nobody believed that.
[01:34:18.728 --> 01:34:21.029]  But then I met Alex Jones.
[01:34:22.219 --> 01:34:23.940]  And I met Talk Radio.
[01:34:26.101 --> 01:34:27.041]  Nobody would touch me.
[01:34:29.042 --> 01:34:33.805]  And all of a sudden, Talk Radio started picking up on it, saying, My God!
[01:34:34.865 --> 01:34:36.306]  This, this, this, this, and this!
[01:34:36.386 --> 01:34:37.547]  Can you prove this?
[01:34:37.647 --> 01:34:38.767]  Can you prove this?
[01:34:39.928 --> 01:34:42.969]  Alex, you remember a reporter from Great Britain.
[01:34:43.610 --> 01:34:45.431]  His name was Ambrose Evans Pritchard.
[01:34:47.011 --> 01:34:50.053]  He had chased me all over the world, trying to catch me.
[01:34:52.515 --> 01:34:54.876]  And Ambrose started breaking the stories.
[01:34:55.876 --> 01:34:57.597]  Well, then I broke Whitewater.
[01:34:58.878 --> 01:35:00.218]  Then I broke Paulgate.
[01:35:01.939 --> 01:35:04.620]  Well, to fight the Clintons, you had to know them.
[01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:12.923]  Now, folks, I'm telling you all this history, thanks to Alex, so that you understand, I know how to beat them.
[01:35:15.299 --> 01:35:18.940]  I don't know how to beat them because I designed this campaign they're running right now.
[01:35:18.980 --> 01:35:23.262]  We did it in 1986, little Vicky Morris and I. We designed this campaign.
[01:35:24.723 --> 01:35:26.243]  Exactly what they're doing.
[01:35:29.785 --> 01:35:30.725]  But we kept going.
[01:35:30.965 --> 01:35:32.586]  We kept going and kept going.
[01:35:32.686 --> 01:35:40.309]  And then finally, I had Mike Isikoff, who was with the Washington Post.
[01:35:42.344 --> 01:35:50.188]  And I had found out by this cook named Chuck about this girl named Monica Lewinsky.
[01:35:51.748 --> 01:35:52.909]  This little blue dress.
[01:35:56.170 --> 01:36:00.672]  And he had taken it to the cleaners while I had paid him $50 and I got the dress.
[01:36:03.253 --> 01:36:05.314]  And that's when the Lewinsky scandal came out.
[01:36:08.476 --> 01:36:11.017]  But to get to Bill Clinton, the problem was
[01:36:11.690 --> 01:36:13.271]  You gotta go through his men.
[01:36:14.473 --> 01:36:20.538]  And what y'all don't know about Hillary, Alex, what you don't know about Hillary, do you know why Bill married her?
[01:36:23.301 --> 01:36:23.561]  Why?
[01:36:24.962 --> 01:36:29.926]  Her father, Hugh Rodham, was the head of the mob in Chicago.
[01:36:32.209 --> 01:36:34.971]  He had a partner named Dan Rostenkowski.
[01:36:39.113 --> 01:36:46.956]  And it just so happened that Dan Rostenkowski happened to be the head of the most powerful House Wage and Wage Committee in Washington.
[01:36:47.316 --> 01:36:49.037]  Larry, uh, your phone's ruffling.
[01:36:49.057 --> 01:36:50.097]  Can you get it up close to your mouth?
[01:36:50.117 --> 01:36:51.038]  Alright.
[01:36:52.238 --> 01:36:57.060]  Uh, he was the head of the House Wage and Wage Committee.
[01:36:57.140 --> 01:37:00.901]  And he later did have to leave because of, uh, corruption scandals, bribery.
[01:37:01.582 --> 01:37:03.482]  Well, yeah, I put him in prison for two years.
[01:37:05.283 --> 01:37:07.724]  Well, then they, they imported Webb Hubble.
[01:37:09.485 --> 01:37:10.426]  To Attorney General.
[01:37:11.246 --> 01:37:19.512]  Because everybody else made a point to Attorney General, they knew I'd get, because I'd already put Jim Guy Tucker in prison in Arkansas.
[01:37:21.454 --> 01:37:24.016]  But then I got Webb Hubble, put him in prison.
[01:37:24.216 --> 01:37:28.940]  Now let's go back though, let's talk about the Vince Foster murder, let's talk about the Clinton death list.
[01:37:32.062 --> 01:37:34.964]  Well, I'll get to that.
[01:37:38.133 --> 01:37:39.834]  So we leveled the playing field.
[01:37:40.755 --> 01:37:43.756]  Now the Clintons are vulnerable.
[01:37:44.216 --> 01:37:44.477]  All right?
[01:37:45.337 --> 01:37:46.077]  Now they're vulnerable.
[01:37:47.718 --> 01:37:52.101]  There was a guy named Jerry Seeper from the Washington Times.
[01:37:54.162 --> 01:37:58.924]  And I had a story where I had caught Vince and Hillary screwing.
[01:38:00.645 --> 01:38:06.068]  I had bugged the governor's mansion with the full intention of catching Bill
[01:38:06.784 --> 01:38:08.125]  Screwin' this Arkansas.
[01:38:10.306 --> 01:38:21.133]  Well, that night, he kinda shafted us, and he went to another house, and Vince came over to Hillary's, to the mansion.
[01:38:23.094 --> 01:38:24.135]  And so I had this tape.
[01:38:26.777 --> 01:38:28.778]  Well, I played it for Jerry Seeper.
[01:38:28.798 --> 01:38:32.740]  Now at that time, I had nothing against Hillary.
[01:38:33.261 --> 01:38:35.182]  You know, my feud was with Bill Clinton.
[01:38:36.363 --> 01:38:37.764]  You and I talked about it a lot.
[01:38:41.446 --> 01:38:46.329]  Vince thought that tape was fixing to be aired in the Washington Times.
[01:38:48.490 --> 01:38:49.851]  Now, folks, I have no idea.
[01:38:49.871 --> 01:38:54.834]  I have no idea somebody killed Vince Foster if he killed himself.
[01:38:56.975 --> 01:39:03.799]  But from the stuff that I got from Star, Ken Star,
[01:39:05.137 --> 01:39:07.518]  Because I had more information than anybody else.
[01:39:09.679 --> 01:39:11.299]  The autopsy was obvious.
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:14.560]  He didn't die in Fort Marcy Park.
[01:39:16.501 --> 01:39:21.063]  And if he didn't die in Fort Marcy Park, then somebody moved the body.
[01:39:22.263 --> 01:39:30.066]  And then we have Hillary with the all-night cleaning crew doing all the carpets, and we have it being a different caliber gun left at the scene than what shot him in the back of the head.
[01:39:30.666 --> 01:39:31.286]  All of that.
[01:39:31.766 --> 01:39:33.387]  Well, you got another little problem.
[01:39:35.403 --> 01:39:44.390]  Hillary was in California, and when she found out, she supposedly flew back to Washington to be with Vince's wife, right?
[01:39:46.851 --> 01:39:52.395]  Well, I actually have the fuel certificate from Central Flying Service.
[01:39:54.297 --> 01:40:01.822]  She flew back to Arkansas, and I actually took Jerry Seeper
[01:40:03.919 --> 01:40:13.764]  To the Rose Law Firm and caught two guys taking boxes marked VF to be burned.
[01:40:14.765 --> 01:40:15.365]  We caught them.
[01:40:16.366 --> 01:40:16.866]  We got them.
[01:40:20.168 --> 01:40:25.370]  And that's why I've said to people, Hillary's gonna make it.
[01:40:25.730 --> 01:40:29.773]  Let me just tell y'all now, we're reliving 94.
[01:40:33.228 --> 01:40:35.969]  Remember when all this stuff with Bill hit?
[01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:52.315]  And remember, Alex, when all of the Republicans, all they did was just morph the long incumbent Democrat head into Bill Clinton and then they won and the Republicans took control of both houses?
[01:40:53.196 --> 01:40:53.496]  Yes.
[01:40:54.036 --> 01:40:54.576]  Remember that?
[01:40:54.936 --> 01:40:55.216]  Yes.
[01:40:56.057 --> 01:40:58.898]  There was no way that year
[01:41:00.308 --> 01:41:05.509]  No way Bill Clinton could have won again as president, except for one thing.
[01:41:07.009 --> 01:41:07.569]  Bob Dole.
[01:41:09.170 --> 01:41:11.430]  Yeah, they ran a weak candidate against him.
[01:41:12.730 --> 01:41:16.231]  Now you see John McCain.
[01:41:18.752 --> 01:41:26.453]  Now folks, the thing that you need to be the most afraid of, and you better be afraid,
[01:41:28.243 --> 01:41:30.924]  Bill Clinton is an inch deep and a mile wide.
[01:41:31.725 --> 01:41:33.746]  He's just a good-timer, just a good old boy.
[01:41:35.247 --> 01:41:36.267]  He didn't believe in anything.
[01:41:36.287 --> 01:41:41.870]  He didn't care about nothing except women, drugs.
[01:41:43.211 --> 01:41:44.131]  That's all he cared about.
[01:41:45.972 --> 01:41:49.674]  But now when I met Hillary, I met her.
[01:41:51.635 --> 01:41:57.738]  She was wearing moo-moo, one-rimmed glasses, had not
[01:41:58.291 --> 01:42:09.256]  He could take in a bath, did not shave under her arms or her legs, wearing sandals, and was carrying a card saying she was a proud member of the United States American Communist Party.
[01:42:11.557 --> 01:42:14.199]  She believes what she believes.
[01:42:15.239 --> 01:42:17.600]  She is what she is.
[01:42:20.682 --> 01:42:27.405]  And it was all scheduled that Bill would run, they would wait, and then she would run.
[01:42:28.652 --> 01:42:33.833]  Now, somehow Bush ended up in there that second term, but that was over the war.
[01:42:37.174 --> 01:42:42.796]  But where everybody gets confused, Alex, is a group that we used to call the Puppet Masters.
[01:42:46.097 --> 01:42:51.899]  I've been a part of destroying more countries than most of y'all even know ever even existed.
[01:42:55.140 --> 01:42:56.500]  And these Puppet Masters
[01:42:57.785 --> 01:42:58.786]  Control everything?
[01:43:00.167 --> 01:43:02.468]  How do you think the Clintons come up with all this money?
[01:43:05.210 --> 01:43:08.872]  And who do you think controls the war in Iraq?
[01:43:10.493 --> 01:43:13.255]  Maliki has asked Bush twice to leave.
[01:43:14.936 --> 01:43:15.336]  Leave!
[01:43:16.417 --> 01:43:17.897]  They've got security under control.
[01:43:17.918 --> 01:43:22.260]  My God, that's the third richest oil reserve in the world?
[01:43:23.881 --> 01:43:26.623]  They've got the fighting among the factions stopped.
[01:43:29.522 --> 01:43:29.942]  We ain't leavin'.
[01:43:29.962 --> 01:43:32.944]  We ain't leavin'.
[01:43:34.646 --> 01:43:39.249]  Larry Nichols, stop right there, because there's so much I want to go over with you.
[01:43:40.690 --> 01:43:43.492]  We know that Oklahoma City was a staged event.
[01:43:43.632 --> 01:43:45.714]  We know 9-11 was a staged event.
[01:43:45.814 --> 01:43:51.017]  We know that no matter what party it is, they keep building up the secret police apparatus.
[01:43:51.578 --> 01:43:58.583]  You, like E. Howard Hunt, have the job of overthrowing nations and running black op squads, and we have a very similar type background.
[01:43:59.429 --> 01:44:05.113]  Coming out of Special Forces and then into Intelligence and you know, being a boots on the ground commander.
[01:44:05.914 --> 01:44:13.460]  Here, it's like a slow-motion 30-year takeover instead of a one-week takeover like Guatemala or Nicaragua or El Salvador or Iran.
[01:44:14.060 --> 01:44:23.287]  They're building camps, they admit it, they've militarized the police, they've tripled the number of cops, they're brainwashing everybody, they're putting up cameras coming in with national ID cards.
[01:44:24.446 --> 01:44:26.827]  I want to go over their global geopolitical plan.
[01:44:26.867 --> 01:44:29.928]  You talked to the Iranian Prime Minister.
[01:44:30.288 --> 01:44:30.769]  Iraqi.
[01:44:31.289 --> 01:44:32.189]  Iraqi Prime Minister.
[01:44:32.569 --> 01:44:32.970]  Excuse me.
[01:44:34.590 --> 01:44:35.311]  Last letter different.
[01:44:36.111 --> 01:44:37.031]  I tend to get that wrong.
[01:44:37.451 --> 01:44:38.812]  You talked to the Iraqi Prime Minister.
[01:44:40.013 --> 01:44:43.614]  Okay, but let's just stop right there.
[01:44:43.634 --> 01:44:45.295]  Well, I know you talked to the Iranians and the Iraqis.
[01:44:45.315 --> 01:44:46.375]  That's what I've seen in the press reports.
[01:44:46.395 --> 01:44:48.816]  But let's just back up here before I get into that.
[01:44:49.637 --> 01:44:50.497]  And before you get into that.
[01:44:52.561 --> 01:44:53.562]  What will happen?
[01:44:53.922 --> 01:44:54.842]  What do you predict?
[01:44:54.862 --> 01:44:56.122]  Because you predicted it in the past.
[01:44:56.142 --> 01:44:57.163]  Everything you said came true.
[01:44:57.803 --> 01:45:03.966]  I think Hillary will have an inaugural terror attack to make us all love her and to be able to really launch martial law.
[01:45:03.986 --> 01:45:04.906]  They won't call it that.
[01:45:05.406 --> 01:45:11.468]  I know they've recruited 26,000 preachers to tell their flocks to turn their guns in, go to FEMA camps, take inoculations.
[01:45:11.849 --> 01:45:16.830]  I reported that over a year with the secret documents we got before it even broke in the news.
[01:45:16.910 --> 01:45:18.051]  It's now come out in the news.
[01:45:19.266 --> 01:45:23.989]  What do you see happening if and when, if the fix is in, Hillary Clinton becomes president?
[01:45:24.409 --> 01:45:30.032]  Well, the first thing you've got to understand, that you've got to learn, is a thing called social engineering.
[01:45:30.052 --> 01:45:32.094]  That's one of the first things we were trained.
[01:45:33.674 --> 01:45:34.675]  Social engineering.
[01:45:36.476 --> 01:45:40.558]  Y'all being social engineers, you think you're voting for president.
[01:45:40.979 --> 01:45:41.439]  You're not.
[01:45:43.580 --> 01:45:45.201]  You're not going to pick who's president.
[01:45:46.322 --> 01:45:46.822]  Others are.
[01:45:48.376 --> 01:45:53.178]  But the way they're going to get us, Alex, they're doing right now.
[01:45:55.479 --> 01:45:57.700]  They're taking American jobs.
[01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:01.001]  There's an invasion.
[01:46:01.381 --> 01:46:02.481]  My God, man.
[01:46:03.582 --> 01:46:07.803]  You were talking before, while I was in the bullpen, you were talking about the pseudofedron.
[01:46:09.644 --> 01:46:11.365]  Well, they don't even have to worry about that now.
[01:46:11.445 --> 01:46:17.067]  Now they got more crack cocaine coming across the border than you can make here.
[01:46:20.717 --> 01:46:24.881]  They're bringing people in, replacing American jobs.
[01:46:25.461 --> 01:46:28.904]  When Americans lose their jobs, what do you lose?
[01:46:29.184 --> 01:46:30.285]  You lose your home.
[01:46:30.385 --> 01:46:32.287]  When you lose your home, what do you lose?
[01:46:32.347 --> 01:46:33.108]  Your family.
[01:46:33.208 --> 01:46:36.491]  You lose your independence, and then they can come in with government jobs.
[01:46:37.572 --> 01:46:42.496]  You end up... There's a term that they use in social engineering.
[01:46:42.536 --> 01:46:43.837]  It's called empowerment.
[01:46:45.098 --> 01:46:45.859]  Disempowerment.
[01:46:46.517 --> 01:46:46.717]  Huh?
[01:46:46.997 --> 01:46:48.318]  They want to disempower the people.
[01:46:48.598 --> 01:46:53.361]  Right, because if you're empowered, you have enough money to control your own life and make your own decisions.
[01:46:53.401 --> 01:46:55.962]  They're always waging war against the middle class.
[01:46:57.122 --> 01:46:58.623]  And they're stripping us down.
[01:46:59.544 --> 01:47:01.164]  And we don't have two years.
[01:47:02.065 --> 01:47:03.906]  This thing's over in two years, buddy.
[01:47:03.926 --> 01:47:05.807]  I agree.
[01:47:05.847 --> 01:47:07.147]  We'll be in total martial law.
[01:47:08.228 --> 01:47:10.429]  And what are you going to do?
[01:47:11.570 --> 01:47:12.750]  What are you going to do?
[01:47:13.110 --> 01:47:14.211]  Who are you going to call?
[01:47:14.231 --> 01:47:15.952]  Who are you going to go to?
[01:47:17.386 --> 01:47:18.386]  There's one way to beat him.
[01:47:20.027 --> 01:47:20.907]  There's one way to beat him.
[01:47:21.247 --> 01:47:34.591]  I want to get into your solution, but fleshing out the type of individual that Hillary and the puppet masters that control her are, the puppeteers, predict, if she gets in, and then we'll talk about trying to stop her, but if she gets in, what do you predict she'll do?
[01:47:35.772 --> 01:47:46.655]  Well, the first thing she'll do is she'll carry on, and you'll know no difference between George Bush and his administration and the Clinton administration.
[01:47:47.250 --> 01:47:47.890]  You'll see none.
[01:47:49.351 --> 01:48:01.559]  Look, does it not make sense to you that since today's statue of Hussein fell in Iraq, that the oil companies have made the largest quarterly profits in the history of the world?
[01:48:01.579 --> 01:48:04.261]  I mean, does that not make some sense to somebody?
[01:48:05.522 --> 01:48:09.144]  By shutting off the oil supply, they create artificial scarcity.
[01:48:10.185 --> 01:48:12.687]  Now, nothing's gonna change.
[01:48:13.928 --> 01:48:14.308]  Nothing.
[01:48:15.023 --> 01:48:15.784]  is going to change.
[01:48:15.804 --> 01:48:20.787]  The only difference is Hillary will be the boss.
[01:48:21.468 --> 01:48:29.554]  Now, when Hillary gets to be the boss, we're going to go back to the old Clinton days in Arkansas.
[01:48:31.375 --> 01:48:34.037]  You cross them, they'll kill you.
[01:48:34.057 --> 01:48:39.240]  You know, I've noticed with Bush, he tends to just let people run around and attack him.
[01:48:39.301 --> 01:48:40.682]  He's got the hubris to ignore it.
[01:48:41.022 --> 01:48:42.463]  But the Clintons, they pay attention.
[01:48:42.503 --> 01:48:43.964]  They like to kill hundreds, don't they?
[01:48:45.033 --> 01:48:48.756]  I guarantee Bush will just let you run around and say what you want to, he doesn't care.
[01:48:50.797 --> 01:48:56.061]  You cross Hillary, and you'll not live to see tomorrow.
[01:48:57.482 --> 01:49:00.524]  And then they'll do what we're trained to do, get you when you're young.
[01:49:01.544 --> 01:49:06.868]  See, if they think you're about to start talking bad about them, you're going to have a car wreck.
[01:49:07.423 --> 01:49:14.148]  Well, that's why Jennifer Flowers was on Hardball, what now, eight years ago, and he said, so you're saying Bill Clinton's killing people?
[01:49:14.208 --> 01:49:16.049]  And she said, yeah, they've killed over a hundred people.
[01:49:16.529 --> 01:49:18.210]  Clinton said, well, why are you still alive?
[01:49:18.230 --> 01:49:19.331]  And she said, because I'm talking.
[01:49:38.300 --> 01:49:41.122]  And she waited a week, and they killed her.
[01:49:41.142 --> 01:49:44.826]  Let's talk about how they killed her when we get back.
[01:49:45.166 --> 01:49:47.128]  Talk about how to stop the Kwanzanistas.
[01:49:47.928 --> 01:49:52.172]  With our guest, Larry Nichols, former CIA Black Op commander.

[01:50:53.871 --> 01:51:06.620]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:51:07.020 --> 01:51:13.765]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[01:51:14.105 --> 01:51:17.707]  And the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:51:18.067 --> 01:51:21.269]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[01:51:21.469 --> 01:51:23.190]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[01:51:23.230 --> 01:51:28.973]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[01:51:56.912 --> 01:52:02.076]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:52:02.436 --> 01:52:07.800]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:52:08.141 --> 01:52:09.261]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:09.642 --> 01:52:18.489]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:52:18.949 --> 01:52:20.550]  Now compare a Calbin Pure Soap.

[01:52:54.905 --> 01:53:00.049]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:53:00.730 --> 01:53:03.092]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:53:05.053 --> 01:53:06.214]  Larry Nichols is our guest.
[01:53:06.234 --> 01:53:08.917]  He brought the first big Clinton scandals and many of the others.
[01:53:09.437 --> 01:53:11.238]  They haven't killed him because he's so prominent.
[01:53:11.479 --> 01:53:12.720]  They haven't tried as well.
[01:53:12.740 --> 01:53:19.585]  You know, so many dumb liberals think that they are just so sweet and kind and loving.
[01:53:19.625 --> 01:53:20.406]  I mean, you've been there.
[01:53:21.463 --> 01:53:23.904]  It's even mainstream knowledge they have a lot of people killed.
[01:53:25.965 --> 01:53:28.767]  Tell us about this poor young lady.
[01:53:29.727 --> 01:53:34.910]  Well, Susan Coleman worked as the nanny at the Governor's Mansion.
[01:53:36.631 --> 01:53:37.751]  And Bill Clinton raped her.
[01:53:38.712 --> 01:53:39.072]  Twice.
[01:53:41.613 --> 01:53:42.794]  And I got her to come out.
[01:53:42.894 --> 01:53:43.534]  Chris Ruddy.
[01:53:44.155 --> 01:53:47.677]  If you'll remember Chris Ruddy, he was with the Pittsburgh Tribune at the time.
[01:53:48.857 --> 01:53:50.358]  I had her fix him to come out.
[01:53:52.126 --> 01:53:55.348]  And, uh, she was gonna come out that Friday.
[01:53:55.368 --> 01:53:57.348]  She backed out.
[01:53:59.810 --> 01:54:01.510]  Well, that weekend, they found her dead.
[01:54:03.131 --> 01:54:11.695]  Now, somehow, she had taken a .380, shot herself in the back of the head, and killed herself.
[01:54:14.076 --> 01:54:20.539]  Well, when we broke into her apartment, she shot herself, supposedly,
[01:54:21.656 --> 01:54:22.616]  Just imagine this.
[01:54:22.676 --> 01:54:24.737]  She shot herself in the right temple.
[01:54:25.058 --> 01:54:25.518]  You with me?
[01:54:26.978 --> 01:54:27.899]  Sitting on a couch.
[01:54:28.899 --> 01:54:32.461]  To the left of the couch was the wall between the living room and the kitchen.
[01:54:32.741 --> 01:54:33.741]  In the apartment, right?
[01:54:35.362 --> 01:54:36.523]  Where would that bullet end up?
[01:54:38.764 --> 01:54:39.124]  Tell us.
[01:54:39.144 --> 01:54:42.826]  It would end up in that wall right there to the left of the couch, wouldn't it?
[01:54:43.126 --> 01:54:43.426]  Yes.
[01:54:45.047 --> 01:54:47.027]  We found the bullet up in the ceiling.
[01:54:48.768 --> 01:54:50.329]  Thirteen feet to the right.
[01:54:51.727 --> 01:54:52.587]  And to the front of her.
[01:54:54.488 --> 01:55:08.656]  Well then I find five nurses that worked with her that they had done such a poor make-up job that when they went to the morgue they didn't want the family to see her because she was such a pretty girl.
[01:55:09.776 --> 01:55:12.838]  So they asked the mortician to let them help do some make-up.
[01:55:12.878 --> 01:55:19.061]  Well they found out that her whole forehead, her right forehead had been made up with cake powder.
[01:55:20.908 --> 01:55:21.608]  She had been killed.
[01:55:21.668 --> 01:55:22.449]  I mean, it doesn't matter.
[01:55:22.489 --> 01:55:23.369]  I mean, she had been killed.
[01:55:24.510 --> 01:55:26.090]  That's just the cost of doing business.
[01:55:26.170 --> 01:55:28.571]  Now, it later came out other women he'd raped.
[01:55:28.632 --> 01:55:29.132]  How often?
[01:55:29.172 --> 01:55:31.573]  I mean, did he always like to rape them and bite them and all the things he did?
[01:55:33.074 --> 01:55:36.075]  Well, what was the other one?
[01:55:36.895 --> 01:55:41.357]  The one in Fort Smith that he raped and beat up?
[01:55:44.078 --> 01:55:44.799]  Oh, my goodness.
[01:55:46.099 --> 01:55:47.280]  Alex, there are so many.
[01:55:49.730 --> 01:55:54.594]  It's hard for me to remember all of them.
[01:55:54.754 --> 01:55:58.737]  I mean, you just... And it's like a bad nightmare.
[01:55:58.797 --> 01:56:00.158]  People thought the Clintons were gone.
[01:56:00.198 --> 01:56:01.539]  You kept saying they're not gone.
[01:56:01.559 --> 01:56:02.720]  They're not gone?
[01:56:02.740 --> 01:56:02.780]  No.
[01:56:03.761 --> 01:56:06.583]  What do you think they've been doing all these years?
[01:56:06.703 --> 01:56:09.145]  They've been getting ready for this day.
[01:56:10.806 --> 01:56:12.928]  These people do not live.
[01:56:14.189 --> 01:56:15.210]  They're not like me.
[01:56:15.230 --> 01:56:17.091]  I mean, they're not like you.
[01:56:17.131 --> 01:56:17.712]  They're like me.
[01:56:18.775 --> 01:56:19.855]  I don't live for today.
[01:56:20.895 --> 01:56:23.356]  By the time today gets here, guess what, folks?
[01:56:23.656 --> 01:56:24.136]  It's over.
[01:56:26.136 --> 01:56:27.637]  You plan for tomorrow.
[01:56:29.157 --> 01:56:38.219]  And if you plan far enough in advance for tomorrow, then you line up the things that you need to happen so that what you want to happen in the future to happen.
[01:56:38.239 --> 01:56:41.919]  And then all you got to do is just make them happen.
[01:56:43.720 --> 01:56:45.320]  But you do not understand
[01:56:46.514 --> 01:56:50.437]  Y'all will not understand, and it's hard for you to believe in some of your cynicism.
[01:56:50.457 --> 01:56:52.839]  This guy's full of crap.
[01:56:52.999 --> 01:56:55.121]  I don't care if you believe me.
[01:56:58.244 --> 01:57:05.369]  Look, half the world's doubted me, but they had no one of them proven it wrong yet.
[01:57:05.730 --> 01:57:10.774]  Well, Mitt Romney just dropped out, so like we said, it's gonna be McCain and Hillary in there, two peas in a pod.
[01:57:10.794 --> 01:57:14.717]  Let's talk about your ideas of how to stop them on the other side.
[01:57:15.831 --> 01:57:24.636]  Remember, when Bush first got in office, he blocked Congressman Dan Burton's committee from investigating Pardongate and all the cocaine dealers and people that they had pardoned.
[01:57:25.536 --> 01:57:30.439]  So it's all a big intelligence op for the puppet masters, and Hillary is their girl.
[01:57:30.899 --> 01:57:31.639]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:32.099 --> 01:57:37.402]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:57:38.283 --> 01:57:40.624]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:57:50.169 --> 01:57:54.371]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:55.011 --> 01:57:55.831]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.571 --> 01:57:57.472]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.492 --> 01:58:01.793]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.334 --> 01:58:06.455]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:11.457 --> 01:58:15.319]  We're now into the third hour on this seventh day of February 2008.
[01:58:16.838 --> 01:58:20.160]  Larry Nichols worked for the CIA in Black Ops, overthrowing nations.
[01:58:21.041 --> 01:58:22.742]  We're going to talk some about that before he leaves us.
[01:58:22.782 --> 01:58:23.402]  Very interesting.
[01:58:24.403 --> 01:58:29.566]  We're talking about the Clintons, their crimes, who they work for, the activities they're going to carry out.
[01:58:30.487 --> 01:58:36.590]  Larry, so many conservatives were against Clinton, and they were against everything communist.
[01:58:36.610 --> 01:58:42.374]  Now they're not worried about communists, they're worried about the Muslim extremists, which we all know our government runs and controls.
[01:58:43.955 --> 01:58:48.258]  And so many conservatives now are emailing me, calling me, saying, look, I don't care.
[01:58:48.298 --> 01:58:49.119]  I support Hillary.
[01:58:50.780 --> 01:58:55.184]  A bunch of national talk show hosts, Republicans, have been endorsing Hillary.
[01:58:56.084 --> 01:59:00.868]  We've had Ann Coulter saying she's for Hillary, quote, she's our girl.
[01:59:01.348 --> 01:59:05.612]  It's come out that Fox News has covertly been raising money for and advising her.
[01:59:05.632 --> 01:59:08.574]  The White House, they admit, has, quote, been helping write her speeches.
[01:59:09.226 --> 01:59:11.027]  I told people about this years ago, now it's out.
[01:59:11.407 --> 01:59:14.388]  We know they're intelligence operatives at a level way above what you were at.
[01:59:15.188 --> 01:59:16.529]  We know that's why they recruited you.
[01:59:17.869 --> 01:59:20.250]  And then you saw their narcotics traveling and wouldn't go along with it.
[01:59:21.111 --> 01:59:22.391]  What do you say to Ann Coulter?
[01:59:22.431 --> 01:59:28.393]  What do you say to all these big former neocons who are now saying, we support Clinton?
[01:59:28.834 --> 01:59:30.654]  And that shows you that she's going to be president.
[01:59:31.014 --> 01:59:36.016]  They're now all bowing down to her, and it shows the fix was in as soon as she got into the Senate.
[01:59:38.078 --> 01:59:42.861]  I mean, what do you say to those mainline conservatives right now that are starting to support Hillary?
[01:59:42.881 --> 01:59:44.581]  I'm with you, Alex.
[01:59:47.023 --> 01:59:52.045]  But what makes us believe that there have been two parties?
[01:59:56.187 --> 01:59:56.387]  What?
[01:59:57.028 --> 01:59:58.989]  I know there hasn't been since they blew Kennedy's head off in 1963.
[01:59:59.229 --> 01:59:59.529]  Yeah.
[02:00:01.930 --> 02:00:04.752]  I mean, these people are going to do what they're told to do.
[02:00:04.812 --> 02:00:07.033]  Look at Bill O'Reilly.
[02:00:07.791 --> 02:00:10.652]  Man, when I met Bill O'Reilly, he was with hard copy.
[02:00:12.072 --> 02:00:21.475]  Now he's this immediate Bill O'Reilly knows no more about the news or what's going on than my English Bulldog.
[02:00:24.556 --> 02:00:26.917]  But the problem, folks, is this.
[02:00:28.638 --> 02:00:29.638]  We're under invasion.
[02:00:29.678 --> 02:00:31.399]  We're under full invasion.
[02:00:31.719 --> 02:00:32.499]  Now you don't believe me.
[02:00:33.755 --> 02:00:35.596]  Let me give you a test.
[02:00:35.676 --> 02:00:37.756]  Now, I'm sorry, Alex, about my voice.
[02:00:37.856 --> 02:00:42.277]  I just spent a week on a slab in the hospital, and I just got out.
[02:00:42.297 --> 02:00:46.118]  I want y'all to take a test.
[02:00:47.859 --> 02:00:53.360]  Open your front door, get in your car, and drive.
[02:00:54.961 --> 02:00:58.902]  Drive by buildings that used to be big plants where Americans worked.
[02:01:00.495 --> 02:01:03.837]  Drive by construction sites where Americans used to lay bricks.
[02:01:04.177 --> 02:01:05.377]  All you see is illegal aliens.
[02:01:05.937 --> 02:01:07.678]  And all you see is illegal aliens.
[02:01:08.178 --> 02:01:09.479]  It's way more than 30 million.
[02:01:10.419 --> 02:01:10.780]  Yeah.
[02:01:11.180 --> 02:01:11.500]  Yeah.
[02:01:12.961 --> 02:01:14.661]  There's that many in California.
[02:01:17.022 --> 02:01:18.423]  Y'all, we're under invasion.
[02:01:18.823 --> 02:01:22.685]  And once they get here, where are we gonna go?
[02:01:23.205 --> 02:01:24.366]  What are you gonna do?
[02:01:25.446 --> 02:01:29.408]  And once you lose your family, once you lose your money,
[02:01:30.169 --> 02:01:36.813]  Once you lose your ability to live, you become a puppet to the government, and you become a slave.
[02:01:36.853 --> 02:01:45.278]  And they're going to have the welfare, and they're going to have the make-work jobs, and they're converting the universities and the scholarships over to police jobs, surveillance, homeland security.
[02:01:45.718 --> 02:01:58.626]  They're going to force people into this, and then Americans, whether you're white, Hispanic, black, Asian, doesn't matter, we're going to lose our standard of living, and we're all just going to be third-world slaves like they are in Mexico, or Nicaragua, or El Salvador.
[02:02:01.234 --> 02:02:04.336]  Look, all you got to do is go to Nicaragua.
[02:02:05.677 --> 02:02:07.278]  I asked Adolfo Calero once.
[02:02:07.298 --> 02:02:08.379]  I was in Managua.
[02:02:09.460 --> 02:02:10.821]  Excuse me.
[02:02:10.981 --> 02:02:12.622]  Here were these beautiful buildings.
[02:02:14.823 --> 02:02:17.545]  And they were all covered in vines and just destroyed.
[02:02:18.446 --> 02:02:19.406]  I said, how'd that happen?
[02:02:19.426 --> 02:02:20.527]  He said, it happened overnight.
[02:02:21.728 --> 02:02:22.128]  Stay there.
[02:02:22.188 --> 02:02:23.389]  I want to hear about that.
[02:02:23.409 --> 02:02:27.752]  I want to hear about how to beat the Clintons, beat the New World Order from your perspective, Larry Nichols.
[02:02:28.532 --> 02:02:29.433]  And then I want to get into
[02:02:30.265 --> 02:02:39.349]  Talk of Doc Mendenegy, talking to Al Maliki, and a lot more on the other side of Larry Nichols.
[02:02:39.429 --> 02:02:40.909]  Very important interview ladies and gentlemen.
[02:02:41.550 --> 02:02:41.970]  Stay with us.

[02:03:47.795 --> 02:03:51.256]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:03:51.416 --> 02:03:53.316]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:03:53.336 --> 02:03:56.617]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:03:56.937 --> 02:04:02.439]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:04:02.719 --> 02:04:06.680]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[02:05:47.023 --> 02:05:53.044]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.645 --> 02:05:56.665]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:56.685 --> 02:06:02.127]  Alright Larry Nichols, I want to start moving quickly with you now.
[02:06:02.687 --> 02:06:05.267]  You were finishing up when you were talking to one of the leaders down there.
[02:06:05.287 --> 02:06:08.288]  I believe you were talking about Nicaragua.
[02:06:08.428 --> 02:06:09.148]  Please continue.
[02:06:09.848 --> 02:06:12.189]  I mean, he said it happened overnight.
[02:06:13.679 --> 02:06:22.146]  One minute it was just a peaceful community and the next minute Sandinistas came in and took over and it became a puppet state.
[02:06:24.128 --> 02:06:25.710]  Now folks, listen to me.
[02:06:26.610 --> 02:06:33.376]  If we don't talk about anything else the rest of the day... Alex, I'm counting on you.
[02:06:34.778 --> 02:06:35.879]  I'm counting on you, son.
[02:06:38.461 --> 02:06:39.302]  Hillary's mine.
[02:06:40.552 --> 02:06:43.574]  Ain't nobody can stop Hillary from being president but me.
[02:06:43.595 --> 02:06:45.016]  Nobody has the documents.
[02:06:45.076 --> 02:06:46.257]  Nobody has the evidence.
[02:06:46.977 --> 02:06:47.438]  I got it.
[02:06:48.879 --> 02:06:50.760]  She's either got to go over me or through me.
[02:06:52.882 --> 02:06:54.183]  That ain't gonna save the country.
[02:06:55.784 --> 02:07:00.548]  There's one thing you can do and save the country tomorrow.
[02:07:00.588 --> 02:07:02.209]  Save it tomorrow.
[02:07:03.130 --> 02:07:04.011]  And we proved it.
[02:07:04.131 --> 02:07:05.312]  You have proven it.
[02:07:06.505 --> 02:07:11.967]  When Bush was president and the Republicans were in control of both houses, they were just like little Indians.
[02:07:12.048 --> 02:07:14.208]  Whatever Bush wanted, they just marched in a row.
[02:07:16.029 --> 02:07:23.333]  It took just a little bit of a balance of power of the Democrats to take away from the Republicans.
[02:07:24.813 --> 02:07:31.576]  And you learned, Alex, the key to this nation, the key that our forefathers gave us.
[02:07:32.557 --> 02:07:33.057]  You hear me?
[02:07:34.170 --> 02:07:36.912]  Our forefathers, they're the ones that taught us what to do.
[02:07:38.874 --> 02:07:42.437]  We need citizen legislators.
[02:07:43.778 --> 02:07:45.619]  Folks, there's never been a time.
[02:07:46.360 --> 02:07:47.721]  You know, how did I beat Clinton?
[02:07:47.881 --> 02:07:50.803]  There was no way to beat Clinton, because I mean, he had control of everything.
[02:07:51.103 --> 02:07:58.949]  But I picked my time, I picked women, of all things, to attack Bill Clinton with, which you really thought was the craziest thing on Earth.
[02:08:00.791 --> 02:08:03.353]  Right now, the American people
[02:08:04.810 --> 02:08:07.832]  Do not want Republican or Democrat.
[02:08:08.232 --> 02:08:09.313]  They're fed up with both.
[02:08:11.394 --> 02:08:16.937]  If y'all will get out and get on the ballot, don't buy yard signs.
[02:08:18.778 --> 02:08:20.479]  Don't buy ads on TV.
[02:08:20.820 --> 02:08:23.101]  Don't go up and down your street advertising.
[02:08:24.722 --> 02:08:33.247]  Just get whatever you gotta do to get your name on the ballot from dog catcher to Congressman to Senator.
[02:08:35.037 --> 02:08:35.878]  As an independent.
[02:08:37.919 --> 02:08:42.521]  Then what happens, Alex, is Hillary has no power.
[02:08:43.822 --> 02:08:44.783]  She has no power.
[02:08:46.864 --> 02:08:51.066]  Because we have citizen legislators there to block her.
[02:08:52.607 --> 02:08:58.631]  The problem is, Larry, and they still have the electronic, you know, fraudulent machines everywhere, but about 40% of the country now,
[02:08:59.349 --> 02:09:01.310]  I have rigged more voting machines than most people have ever seen.
[02:09:01.330 --> 02:09:02.850]  I will teach you how to beat that.
[02:09:02.890 --> 02:09:03.691]  You don't have to do anything.
[02:09:03.731 --> 02:09:04.511]  All you gotta do is go blow.
[02:09:28.658 --> 02:09:29.278]  On the ballot.
[02:09:30.299 --> 02:09:32.279]  And one's Republican, one's Democrat.
[02:09:32.740 --> 02:09:34.300]  And then here's this guy, Joe Bull.
[02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:37.301]  And people say, well, what do you stand for, Joe Bull?
[02:09:37.441 --> 02:09:38.161]  Don't tell them.
[02:09:39.682 --> 02:09:40.342]  Don't tell them.
[02:09:40.362 --> 02:09:43.663]  Because if you tell them, Alex, you're in 40-40-20.
[02:09:43.683 --> 02:09:48.025]  40-40-20 means if somebody, if you like this, somebody hates it.
[02:09:49.085 --> 02:09:49.966]  So you don't tell them.
[02:09:51.306 --> 02:09:56.168]  What difference, Alex, would it make if Al Capone were in Congress?
[02:09:56.966 --> 02:09:59.928]  What in God's name could he do anymore to this country?
[02:10:00.189 --> 02:10:01.710]  Well, Larry, let's expand on that.
[02:10:02.250 --> 02:10:07.294]  I think the key here is, as you said, continue to expose how they're getting rid of our sovereignty, North American Union.
[02:10:07.654 --> 02:10:10.256]  This is the end days for this country if we don't turn it around now.
[02:10:12.078 --> 02:10:13.439]  Look at the army you've got.
[02:10:14.039 --> 02:10:16.121]  You've got people that drive nails.
[02:10:16.221 --> 02:10:17.582]  They're not driving nails.
[02:10:18.142 --> 02:10:20.764]  Look what happened in this election.
[02:10:21.225 --> 02:10:25.588]  This election that you just saw is proof that what I'm telling you will work.
[02:10:26.505 --> 02:10:30.675]  People will show up if they think they can win.
[02:10:30.855 --> 02:10:35.085]  Yeah, you're talking about the 2006 election where they put Democrats in wanting change.
[02:10:35.925 --> 02:10:36.145]  Yeah.
[02:10:36.405 --> 02:10:38.687]  And they didn't get it, so now you think they're going to go for independent.
[02:10:38.707 --> 02:10:39.127]  I agree.
[02:10:39.188 --> 02:10:42.490]  Ron Paul needs to soon run for independent.
[02:10:42.510 --> 02:10:44.411]  They're talking about him winning a brokered convention.
[02:10:44.672 --> 02:10:47.534]  How would he win a brokered convention when he's going to get less than 10% of the vote?
[02:10:47.554 --> 02:10:48.535]  He's not going to win it.
[02:10:48.735 --> 02:10:50.496]  It's not at the presidential level.
[02:10:50.576 --> 02:10:51.076]  I agree.
[02:10:51.137 --> 02:10:58.762]  I've always said, why do we have 50-60% turnout at the national level, but then 8% on average at the local?
[02:10:58.842 --> 02:11:00.403]  I'll tell you what Ron Paul can do.
[02:11:00.423 --> 02:11:03.566]  Ron Paul can go around this nation
[02:11:04.167 --> 02:11:09.911]  And he can say, you, Mr. Farmer, you, Mr. Nail Driver, you, Mr. Roofer.
[02:11:10.031 --> 02:11:10.712]  He's been doing that.
[02:11:11.092 --> 02:11:13.134]  Get your name on the ballot.
[02:11:13.354 --> 02:11:14.094]  He's been doing that.
[02:11:15.315 --> 02:11:24.502]  And if we can get enough independents in Congress... There'll be so many independents running, they can't engage in fraud everywhere and fix it.
[02:11:24.942 --> 02:11:26.003]  They can't stop it.
[02:11:26.043 --> 02:11:26.624]  You got it.
[02:11:27.104 --> 02:11:27.704]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:11:27.724 --> 02:11:32.508]  You're the only one with a voice big enough to do that, buddy.
[02:11:34.051 --> 02:11:39.343]  Oh, I mean, my show's pretty good size, but I mean, if the listeners move on ideas, it can certainly have an effect.
[02:11:39.383 --> 02:11:42.450]  And I think, out of a toolbox of things, that's certainly there.
[02:11:42.711 --> 02:11:44.515]  But also, what you did on Talk Radio,
[02:11:45.128 --> 02:11:45.808]  Hey, you let them mess with me.
[02:11:45.828 --> 02:11:46.289]  You know, I've known
[02:12:15.445 --> 02:12:15.565]  No.
[02:12:15.625 --> 02:12:15.765]  No.
[02:12:35.046 --> 02:12:42.067]  Should at least be interviewed when they're interviewing anybody that might have ever known a shoe they ever wore?
[02:12:42.368 --> 02:12:44.588]  But like you said, the establishment fixes in.
[02:12:44.608 --> 02:12:50.889]  We're going to have to have you back for a second interview, Larry, but in the time we've got left, I want to switch gears over into the cable cutting.
[02:12:51.209 --> 02:12:52.390]  Now it is six cables.
[02:12:53.330 --> 02:12:56.511]  The open buildup of troops, open discussions of attacking Iran.
[02:12:57.231 --> 02:12:59.771]  You've talked to the Iranian leader.
[02:12:59.811 --> 02:13:01.131]  You've talked to the Iraqi leader.
[02:13:01.992 --> 02:13:03.492]  Let's talk about talking
[02:13:04.329 --> 02:13:08.833]  You have these sources going back to the Mujahideen and your CIA operations there, Larry.
[02:13:09.313 --> 02:13:13.637]  Let's go back here first and talk about your discussions with Al-Maliki.
[02:13:15.158 --> 02:13:22.464]  Maliki is ready with a government that they have already formed, that is set up.
[02:13:22.504 --> 02:13:29.430]  You see, they were running under, until the 16th of last month, what's called the Burma Provisional Government.
[02:13:30.811 --> 02:13:33.153]  Our government gave them all these benchmarks to hit.
[02:13:34.201 --> 02:13:36.002]  Yeah, but do you know what the little trick was?
[02:13:37.303 --> 02:13:37.604]  Tell me.
[02:13:37.764 --> 02:13:39.886]  They rigged it to where they couldn't hit any of them.
[02:13:41.106 --> 02:13:44.009]  Well, they want to stay there to keep the oil from flowing to keep prices up.
[02:13:44.229 --> 02:13:44.469]  Right.
[02:13:44.689 --> 02:13:47.471]  Now, Maliki is autonomous.
[02:13:48.853 --> 02:13:52.435]  Iraq now is an autonomous nation.
[02:13:52.495 --> 02:13:55.618]  Yeah, their puppet ceased to be a puppet, what, six months ago.
[02:13:55.658 --> 02:13:56.639]  He said, I want you to leave.
[02:13:57.359 --> 02:13:59.681]  And he told them, and remember what Bush said.
[02:13:59.721 --> 02:14:02.083]  Bush said, when y'all stand up, we'll stand down.
[02:14:02.303 --> 02:14:03.444]  Maliki stood up.
[02:14:03.993 --> 02:14:12.019]  He's standing up, but they're trying not to leave, and they're trying to start a kind of kick fight between Iran.
[02:14:12.459 --> 02:14:18.224]  You know, they were saying that Iran was providing all of these weapons into Iraq, and I'm sitting here.
[02:14:18.244 --> 02:14:20.665]  I mean, I'm talking to them, Alex.
[02:14:20.966 --> 02:14:21.886]  I'm talking to them.
[02:14:22.507 --> 02:14:25.809]  And I go on the air, and I go, show them to me.
[02:14:28.351 --> 02:14:28.611]  Show us.
[02:14:28.631 --> 02:14:30.753]  Well, you notice they never showed us.
[02:14:32.671 --> 02:14:35.412]  They're trying to start a regional conflict.
[02:14:36.152 --> 02:14:42.134]  If you understand... Well, that's the old... Yeah, that's the 1983 Israeli plan that we've adopted.
[02:14:42.414 --> 02:14:52.416]  Break the place up, break each nation in three to four parts, sow sectarian violence against Shiites, Sunni, and the Kurds, and that's been the policy, and they've carried out the policy.
[02:14:52.457 --> 02:15:00.979]  If you understand the plan that's been around since I've been around, you control through chaos.
[02:15:01.795 --> 02:15:02.775]  Ordered through chaos.
[02:15:03.156 --> 02:15:03.356]  Yep.
[02:15:04.716 --> 02:15:12.760]  And so, that's why, unless we stop it, it ain't gonna end.
[02:15:13.040 --> 02:15:16.182]  And it's hard for black ops to build something, make something good.
[02:15:16.222 --> 02:15:18.242]  It's easy to destroy and get everybody killing each other.
[02:15:19.083 --> 02:15:20.363]  Oh yeah, I mean, my God.
[02:15:20.624 --> 02:15:21.484]  Let me ask you this.
[02:15:22.756 --> 02:15:27.057]  They were talking about insurgents and I'm sitting here going, what are you talking insurgents?
[02:15:27.137 --> 02:15:30.117]  And it turns out the government was funding all the sides and giving them weapons.
[02:15:30.237 --> 02:15:31.278]  Oh yeah, go figure.
[02:15:31.578 --> 02:15:37.419]  I mean, if the Sunnis hated the Shias and the Shias hated the Sunnis and they were fighting each other, right?
[02:15:38.299 --> 02:15:42.720]  Then why would you need an insurgent to come in and start a fight between them?
[02:15:42.920 --> 02:15:44.580]  They ought to do it automatically, right?
[02:15:44.880 --> 02:15:45.420]  Absolutely.
[02:15:47.420 --> 02:15:48.161]  It is ready.
[02:15:48.361 --> 02:15:49.121]  It's time.
[02:15:49.301 --> 02:15:50.861]  We have to stand up.
[02:15:51.388 --> 02:15:57.571]  We have to stand up through our people, through our voices, through our Congress, through Ron Paul.
[02:15:57.651 --> 02:16:00.713]  Folks, you have to put the maximum effort out.
[02:16:00.733 --> 02:16:02.714]  Tell us a little bit about the work you did in Afghanistan.
[02:16:03.554 --> 02:16:07.136]  And when you first, I mean, when was the first time you talked to Ahmadinejad?
[02:16:08.157 --> 02:16:14.340]  Well, I talked to him because they were negotiating a thing between Maliki.
[02:16:16.401 --> 02:16:18.062]  At that time, if you'll remember,
[02:16:19.388 --> 02:16:24.051]  America did not want Maliki to negotiate with Iran.
[02:16:26.212 --> 02:16:36.298]  And because I'm the Paladin, and I know Sistani, I was able to help set up a negotiation.
[02:16:37.939 --> 02:16:39.880]  When did you first get into Afghanistan?
[02:16:39.940 --> 02:16:40.641]  How long were you there?
[02:16:41.962 --> 02:16:44.563]  I was there, I guess what, maybe 84, 85?
[02:16:48.337 --> 02:16:49.117]  Six, maybe.
[02:16:49.638 --> 02:16:51.158]  Two years, whatever, two years.
[02:16:51.218 --> 02:16:51.918]  What were you doing?
[02:16:52.419 --> 02:16:53.139]  Killing Russians.
[02:16:56.900 --> 02:16:58.901]  Were you with the teams or were you bringing weapons in?
[02:17:00.181 --> 02:17:03.903]  Well, I mean, we would run weapons across Pakistan.
[02:17:04.123 --> 02:17:04.643]  On the mules?
[02:17:05.303 --> 02:17:12.126]  Yeah, into, you know, into the mountains in Afghanistan and then you just sit back and shot Russians until the Russians quit.
[02:17:15.147 --> 02:17:16.087]  I mean, it was fun.
[02:17:16.147 --> 02:17:17.408]  I mean, it was something to do.
[02:17:19.776 --> 02:17:29.584]  Stay there, I want to talk about when you talk to Al Maliki, when you talk to Ahmadinejad, and this is amazing information.
[02:17:29.624 --> 02:17:31.045]  People find all this hard to believe.
[02:17:31.085 --> 02:17:32.926]  Everything Larry Nichols has ever told me is checked out.
[02:17:34.488 --> 02:17:37.130]  This is the guy who they admit brought all the big scandals on Clinton.
[02:17:38.050 --> 02:17:40.612]  We'll be right back with Larry Nichols on the other side.
[02:17:40.632 --> 02:17:44.455]  Then I'm going to have Larry Wright shotgun with us when we have the veterans against McCain coming on.
[02:17:46.337 --> 02:17:47.678]  It is a big idea
[02:17:48.800 --> 02:17:51.502]  A new world order in the near future.
[02:17:52.382 --> 02:17:54.824]  Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:17:55.464 --> 02:17:57.245]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[02:17:58.286 --> 02:18:00.527]  Both their objectives being world domination.
[02:18:01.067 --> 02:18:03.529]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[02:18:04.269 --> 02:18:11.614]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:18:14.592 --> 02:18:19.594]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:18:20.054 --> 02:18:23.535]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:18:23.915 --> 02:18:26.415]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for the world government.
[02:18:26.475 --> 02:18:27.436]  Most people have no idea.
[02:18:27.456 --> 02:18:28.416]  They're not after money.
[02:18:28.436 --> 02:18:29.496]  They have all the money they need.
[02:18:29.696 --> 02:18:30.437]  They're after power.
[02:18:30.697 --> 02:18:31.717]  That's what they're after.

[02:18:57.528 --> 02:19:10.636]  It was Patrick Henry who forced the Bill of Rights to be added to the Constitution, your unalienable or unchangeable right to religious freedom, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, or the right to own a gun.
[02:19:11.533 --> 02:19:16.857]  There are certain movements underway to strip you of these unalienable, unchangeable rights today.

[02:21:24.498 --> 02:21:28.980]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[02:21:29.140 --> 02:21:30.941]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[02:21:31.001 --> 02:21:31.181]  That's 877-943-8600.
[02:21:31.201 --> 02:21:31.581]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[02:21:31.601 --> 02:21:32.882]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[02:21:32.902 --> 02:21:33.602]  Visit FDRS.org today.
[02:21:45.919 --> 02:21:49.901]  We don't need no education.
[02:21:49.921 --> 02:22:02.648]  We don't need no... Larry Nichols, any websites, phone numbers, contact info you want to give out for other talk show hosts that might want to interview you?
[02:22:04.249 --> 02:22:07.691]  My number is 501-329-1159.
[02:22:08.271 --> 02:22:13.074]  Well, let's give that out at the end of the interview and I would ask listeners to not just call you because you might get a thousand phone calls.
[02:22:14.383 --> 02:22:15.503]  But think about it.
[02:22:15.543 --> 02:22:17.544]  Let me explain to you about Iran.
[02:22:17.664 --> 02:22:18.444]  May I please?
[02:22:18.464 --> 02:22:19.664]  Go ahead.
[02:22:19.684 --> 02:22:21.105]  Because nobody does.
[02:22:22.785 --> 02:22:23.505]  Amazon.
[02:22:24.685 --> 02:22:26.266]  He's got nukes, folks.
[02:22:26.346 --> 02:22:27.386]  He's had them.
[02:22:27.826 --> 02:22:29.266]  He got them from Korea.
[02:22:29.446 --> 02:22:31.027]  He got them from China.
[02:22:31.487 --> 02:22:32.687]  He got them from Russia.
[02:22:33.607 --> 02:22:40.969]  He doesn't need nuclear plants to build plutonium rods to create nuclear weapons.
[02:22:41.582 --> 02:22:43.583]  You know what their problem is, Alex?
[02:22:45.003 --> 02:22:47.864]  Their oil is drying up into sludge.
[02:22:49.385 --> 02:22:50.545]  And they need the power.
[02:22:52.906 --> 02:22:53.666]  They need the power.
[02:22:53.766 --> 02:22:57.848]  Well, they are building peaceful plants that have nothing to do with uranium enrichment.
[02:22:57.868 --> 02:22:59.468]  I don't know if they have weapons, as you say.
[02:22:59.528 --> 02:23:03.089]  I know that our government helped give Pakistan the weapons.
[02:23:03.169 --> 02:23:03.950]  Why would the U.S.
[02:23:03.970 --> 02:23:05.190]  help Pakistan get nukes?
[02:23:06.210 --> 02:23:08.471]  Well, go figure.
[02:23:12.299 --> 02:23:18.224]  We're, our job in the Middle East is to keep that place in turmoil.
[02:23:19.986 --> 02:23:29.114]  And as long as it's in turmoil, then there's one bunch that supposedly has the big stick that controls it all, which are the major oil companies.
[02:23:30.415 --> 02:23:36.080]  But let me tell you, Nary Al-Maliki ain't putting up with it anymore.
[02:23:37.141 --> 02:23:37.861]  He's had it.
[02:23:38.962 --> 02:23:39.623]  He's finished.
[02:23:41.880 --> 02:23:46.043]  And so he's made alliances with Iran, with Syria.
[02:23:46.264 --> 02:23:47.505]  Why do you think they killed Budo?
[02:23:49.566 --> 02:23:50.367]  Why do you think?
[02:23:52.329 --> 02:23:53.289]  Well, I'm asking you, Larry.
[02:23:54.350 --> 02:23:56.952]  Because they didn't want any stability.
[02:23:57.293 --> 02:24:02.337]  Actually, they killed her because there was a plan at the same time to kill Maliki and...
[02:24:04.082 --> 02:24:04.702]  The rest of them.
[02:24:04.862 --> 02:24:05.703]  Yeah, that's the M.O.
[02:24:05.763 --> 02:24:06.103]  I've got.
[02:24:06.123 --> 02:24:22.568]  And then machine gunned her in front of everybody, and then blew her up, and then said she hit her head, and then hundreds of witnesses and videos came out of it being a lie, and our media's telling us that, uh, the current dictator is... I mean, I got her right there on TV in front of us, and everybody just goes, okay, see, we're all looking at the Super Bowl.
[02:24:22.628 --> 02:24:24.188]  We're all looking at this election.
[02:24:25.168 --> 02:24:29.010]  What y'all better be careful of is what you're not looking at.
[02:24:30.230 --> 02:24:32.271]  Now, I want to say one thing very clear.
[02:24:32.291 --> 02:24:33.651]  I want to say it right now.
[02:24:35.341 --> 02:24:42.767]  If you think I'm against the American soldier, then you need to come to 58 Kensington Drive, Conway, Arkansas.
[02:24:42.787 --> 02:24:45.490]  Because we're gonna fight.
[02:24:46.811 --> 02:24:48.012]  There's no better soldier.
[02:24:48.392 --> 02:24:48.812]  No better.
[02:24:50.634 --> 02:24:51.314]  No braver.
[02:24:52.655 --> 02:24:57.479]  But you gotta understand what's hap... You gotta be a soldier to understand what's happening to them.
[02:24:58.900 --> 02:25:02.944]  These kids are serving two, three, four, five tours.
[02:25:04.702 --> 02:25:06.564]  Alex, they're coming back.
[02:25:07.745 --> 02:25:11.548]  Have you been standing by somebody when their head got blowed off?
[02:25:11.568 --> 02:25:13.930]  Have you done that?
[02:25:14.270 --> 02:25:14.771]  No, I haven't.
[02:25:15.932 --> 02:25:19.335]  Let me tell you, it's a pretty impressive thing.
[02:25:19.615 --> 02:25:21.477]  They're feeding our troops into a meat grinder.
[02:25:21.497 --> 02:25:23.098]  They're keeping them in over four tours.
[02:25:23.378 --> 02:25:25.460]  That wasn't done in Vietnam, World War, World War II.
[02:25:25.860 --> 02:25:28.443]  It's like... Yeah, now, let me give you a little tip.
[02:25:28.863 --> 02:25:30.144]  Look at all the generals.
[02:25:31.225 --> 02:25:32.026]  Look at the generals.
[02:25:33.038 --> 02:25:34.860]  And I want you to look on her left breath.
[02:25:36.081 --> 02:25:45.068]  And if you don't see this long, blue rifle, which is called a 90-day badge, that guy ain't ever even been in combat.
[02:25:46.370 --> 02:25:49.793]  We've got American soldiers right now playing chicken and egg.
[02:25:51.414 --> 02:25:52.195]  Can you believe that?
[02:25:52.995 --> 02:25:53.636]  Chicken and egg.
[02:25:55.838 --> 02:25:56.739]  Watch chicken and egg.
[02:25:57.860 --> 02:26:00.642]  Let's say you and I, we're on one corner, alright?
[02:26:01.334 --> 02:26:02.875]  Of a four-way intersection, right?
[02:26:03.695 --> 02:26:05.836]  And we're sitting in an old building that's been blown up.
[02:26:07.497 --> 02:26:10.918]  We get a call from command, and you know what they tell us to do, our squad?
[02:26:11.138 --> 02:26:11.899]  Talk into your phone.
[02:26:12.899 --> 02:26:21.743]  They tell us to go across the street and set up perimeter at the other service station on the other side.
[02:26:21.843 --> 02:26:22.483]  You know why?
[02:26:23.344 --> 02:26:27.946]  So that when we cross, the enemy will shoot at us,
[02:26:29.085 --> 02:26:33.087]  And then we'll know where the enemy is so we can shoot back at them.
[02:26:33.107 --> 02:26:37.689]  Yeah, they put them in those little troop deployments for, quote, security as bait.
[02:26:38.929 --> 02:26:40.250]  It's called the chicken and the egg.
[02:26:40.470 --> 02:26:41.270]  Why do that?
[02:26:42.130 --> 02:26:44.832]  What difference does that corner make than the other one?
[02:26:44.872 --> 02:26:45.572]  Just sit there.
[02:26:45.612 --> 02:26:47.313]  The bad guys will come to you.
[02:26:47.813 --> 02:26:55.296]  If you've been in battle, if you've been in combat, trust me, if they're bad guys, they'll come to you.
[02:26:56.016 --> 02:26:56.897]  They'll come to you.
[02:26:57.057 --> 02:26:57.937]  And then you know what you do?
[02:26:58.706 --> 02:26:59.186]  You kill them.
[02:27:00.567 --> 02:27:01.608]  Then nobody gets hurt.
[02:27:02.748 --> 02:27:03.629]  Everybody comes home.
[02:27:05.030 --> 02:27:09.612]  Our soldiers need to come home now.
[02:27:09.993 --> 02:27:15.756]  Well, 70 plus percent are against the war, but they tell us they're going to stay there, showing the puppet masters, showing everything.
[02:27:16.156 --> 02:27:17.797]  Stay there, Larry Nichols.
[02:27:18.137 --> 02:27:22.840]  We've got Ted Sampley of Veterans Against McCain.
[02:27:23.689 --> 02:27:29.292]  Coming on the breakdown, who he is, he's just like Bob Dole, like he said, meant to lose to Hillary Clinton.
[02:27:29.973 --> 02:27:32.774]  We'll be right back with our guest, Larry Nichols.
[02:27:36.056 --> 02:27:39.058]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.978 --> 02:27:42.700]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.839 --> 02:27:50.785]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[02:27:51.105 --> 02:27:52.987]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[02:27:53.187 --> 02:27:56.231]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[02:27:56.411 --> 02:27:59.554]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[02:27:59.855 --> 02:28:01.697]  We are living in this time of Earth's history.
[02:28:01.957 --> 02:28:05.659]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[02:28:05.959 --> 02:28:08.621]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[02:28:09.241 --> 02:28:13.504]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[02:28:13.724 --> 02:28:18.026]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation.
[02:28:18.427 --> 02:28:22.769]  The Bible says, Would like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, the unholy alliance.
[02:28:23.069 --> 02:28:26.271]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious,
[02:28:26.471 --> 02:28:26.831]  I think so.
[02:28:46.138 --> 02:28:50.399]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:28:50.659 --> 02:28:55.541]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:28:55.761 --> 02:28:57.081]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:28:57.261 --> 02:29:00.622]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?
[02:29:00.862 --> 02:29:06.043]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.
[02:29:06.283 --> 02:29:12.045]  Marty Schachter founded Calbin Soap Company in 1947 and provided products for health institutions.
[02:29:12.385 --> 02:29:14.767]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.
[02:29:14.907 --> 02:29:17.209]  Triple concentrated for all your cleaning needs.

[02:29:21.053 --> 02:29:21.974]  No animal testing.
[02:29:22.254 --> 02:29:23.535]  I use them and love them.
[02:29:23.555 --> 02:29:25.177]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[02:29:25.457 --> 02:29:26.618]  And I save big time.
[02:29:26.878 --> 02:29:28.119]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[02:29:28.139 --> 02:29:28.339]  That's 1-800-340-7091.
[02:29:28.379 --> 02:29:29.961]  Or log on to 5starsoap.com now for a free catalog.
[02:29:38.348 --> 02:29:44.873]  Again, that number, 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[02:29:45.874 --> 02:29:49.978]  If your body isn't feeling too well these days, you're going to start taking this hemp.
[02:29:50.138 --> 02:29:51.499]  I say go to hempusa.org.
[02:29:55.876 --> 02:30:00.338]  You may not like what I'm about to say, but you know I'm gonna say it anyway.
[02:30:00.658 --> 02:30:02.759]  The government doesn't want the best for you.
[02:30:03.120 --> 02:30:04.180]  They keep you down.
[02:30:04.360 --> 02:30:05.281]  They keep you blue.
[02:30:05.561 --> 02:30:08.462]  They starve your body for all its nutrients.
[02:30:10.483 --> 02:30:12.584]  They won't let you grow industrial hemp.
[02:30:12.944 --> 02:30:18.307]  It really doesn't make any kind of sense when it's so healthy for the world and useful for you, my friends.
[02:30:20.214 --> 02:30:24.778]  I hope Mr. Bush will hear this song, for the heart of America wants this one.
[02:30:24.798 --> 02:30:29.062]  Go to hempusa.org.
[02:30:29.643 --> 02:30:34.527]  If you're a truther, an anarchist, a renegade, you only want things that God has made.
[02:30:34.587 --> 02:30:38.831]  Go to hempusa.org.
[02:30:39.091 --> 02:30:41.233]  We offer free shipping anywhere in the states.
[02:30:41.313 --> 02:30:43.475]  Go to hempusa.org.
[02:31:15.204 --> 02:31:17.865]  Larry Nichols is riding shotgun with us for the rest of the half hour.
[02:31:17.885 --> 02:31:23.508]  We're going to have Ted Lane Sandley up for a full hour either next week or the week after that.
[02:31:23.528 --> 02:31:24.708]  30 minutes is not enough.
[02:31:25.229 --> 02:31:27.770]  I can't go over his incredibly distinguished military career.
[02:31:27.810 --> 02:31:30.471]  He heads up Vietnam veterans against John McCain.
[02:31:32.032 --> 02:31:39.639]  In Vietnam, Staff Sergeant Sampley served as company commander of the 36th Mike Force Civilian Irregular Defense Corps Company.
[02:31:40.720 --> 02:31:49.829]  Assigned to operate along the Cambodian border during that year of combat, Sampley was awarded four bronze stars, the Army Commendation Medal, and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry.
[02:31:50.600 --> 02:31:52.861]  And of course he was in the Green Beret Special Forces.
[02:31:52.881 --> 02:32:01.543]  In 1977 he was reassigned to the 3rd and later the 6th Special Forces group at Fort Bragg where he continued his military training and it just goes on and on.
[02:32:02.023 --> 02:32:03.604]  All the things he did in Vietnam.
[02:32:04.124 --> 02:32:09.805]  He got, what is it, four bronze stars while he was there in Cambodia and Vietnam.
[02:32:10.546 --> 02:32:15.547]  And I've had veterans on years ago who were actually in the camp with McCain.
[02:32:16.327 --> 02:32:17.808]  He made all the propaganda films.
[02:32:17.848 --> 02:32:19.268]  He spilt his guts immediately.
[02:32:20.309 --> 02:32:23.072]  Uh, and he's just, he's anti-gun, pro-open border.
[02:32:23.753 --> 02:32:33.083]  His wife has campaigned for Hillary, whereas Hillary Clinton pins, uh, you watch, it's just like Bob Dole, they're running the dead horse against Clinton, and it's going to be Hillary Clinton.
[02:32:33.103 --> 02:32:40.531]  And I told you that Romney was going to step down, he's done that today, and that's exactly what Larry Nichols, who helped bring out the first, uh,
[02:32:41.500 --> 02:32:44.122]  Scandals on the Clintons and many others is saying as well.
[02:32:44.162 --> 02:32:46.583]  He's waiting in the wings to pop in and make some comments.
[02:32:47.004 --> 02:32:48.345]  Mr. Sampley, you've got the floor.
[02:32:48.385 --> 02:32:50.746]  We appreciate you coming on the show.
[02:32:50.786 --> 02:32:53.008]  Thank you very much for having me on board.
[02:32:53.328 --> 02:32:55.129]  Just condense it down as much as you can.
[02:32:56.170 --> 02:33:01.834]  When you first learned about McCain, why you head up this organization and some other groups putting out the same info.
[02:33:02.674 --> 02:33:04.015]  I mean, it's not just what he did in the war.
[02:33:04.075 --> 02:33:05.436]  They call him Mr. Anti-Corruption.
[02:33:05.456 --> 02:33:06.637]  He was part of the Keating Five.
[02:33:07.604 --> 02:33:11.847]  It's like having Herman Goering running the Nuremberg Trials and we break down who John McCain really is.
[02:33:12.228 --> 02:33:14.069]  John McCain is a chameleon.
[02:33:14.630 --> 02:33:15.971]  Like a lizard, a reptile.
[02:33:15.991 --> 02:33:20.774]  It changes, it turns the color of the limb he's on at the time and he gets away with it.
[02:33:21.275 --> 02:33:26.038]  Because he forever has had the liberal talking heads in this country.
[02:33:27.319 --> 02:33:32.223]  Tim Russerts and Chris Matthews, that crowd adore him and cannot say enough good about him.
[02:33:33.209 --> 02:33:38.733]  And they have built this false image of a POW resistor hero.
[02:33:39.354 --> 02:33:56.927]  If you go back and read his record very clearly, at the best you can give John McCain was, he was a POW survivor who traded inflammation for better medical care and other special gifts he got from the Communists.
[02:34:02.520 --> 02:34:06.843]  So he collaborated very seriously, but I know John McCain personally.
[02:34:06.883 --> 02:34:09.926]  I met him in 1986 or 88, somewhere in there.
[02:34:10.506 --> 02:34:11.727]  I think it was 88 when he was in Congress.
[02:34:12.608 --> 02:34:18.813]  And it was over the POW issue, and I was in his office, and it just wasn't a good feeling.
[02:34:18.853 --> 02:34:20.715]  We were supposed to be a casual conversation.
[02:34:20.735 --> 02:34:23.417]  I thought he acted like a screw was loose a little bit.
[02:34:23.777 --> 02:34:29.942]  As we were talking, and I was talking about the man left behind, he got up and started walking around, and then he paced right out of the office and left me sitting there.
[02:34:29.962 --> 02:34:31.203]  He didn't say yay, nay, or anything.
[02:34:32.003 --> 02:34:36.065]  And I got up and kind of tagged along behind him, and he just outpaced me, so I just went on about my way.
[02:34:36.685 --> 02:34:57.613]  And the real concern was in 1992, during the Senate Select Committee on POW Affairs, that Senate study that the Senate commissioned, it took 18 months to study and report on what happened to the American servicemen known to have been alive in captivity, but not returned at the end of the war.
[02:34:58.499 --> 02:35:04.086]  McCain, you would think, would be the best friend of the families of the men still missing and left behind.
[02:35:04.546 --> 02:35:07.129]  He turned out to be Hanoi's best friend.
[02:35:08.631 --> 02:35:15.840]  We started looking closely and he had for some time been carrying water for the communist Vietnamese, trying to pass legislation.
[02:35:16.730 --> 02:35:21.992]  Uh, get legislation passed that would open the door to give communist Vietnam normalized relations.
[02:35:22.092 --> 02:35:26.734]  Something that we didn't want until the communist Vietnamese fessed up for what they did with our men.
[02:35:27.054 --> 02:35:33.017]  And that's why he worships them and they call him the songbird, is because they've got all the dirt on him.
[02:35:33.037 --> 02:35:35.298]  They have everything that he did.
[02:35:35.578 --> 02:35:36.778]  They kept meticulous notes.
[02:35:37.038 --> 02:35:43.421]  And not only did the Vietnamese communists have it, the Chinese have it, the former Soviets, which would be the Russian intelligence, have it.
[02:35:43.837 --> 02:35:52.644]  The Cubans have it, and there was even some Palestinian involvement as observers in observing the interrogation of American prisoners of war.
[02:35:52.764 --> 02:35:56.347]  Could you call him the ultimate security risk if he was going to be the Commander-in-Chief?
[02:35:57.048 --> 02:36:00.650]  Absolutely, and when one other entity has it, the CIA knows what he did.
[02:36:01.071 --> 02:36:08.677]  So there's a man that at the slightest threat, that if any of those collaborations, if the seriousness of them is made public,
[02:36:10.874 --> 02:36:14.195]  He'll go under, so he's going to have to bend when the CIA tells him to bend.
[02:36:14.335 --> 02:36:18.556]  Let's bring Larry Nichols in here because he's an expert on this and he was involved in Black Ops as well.
[02:36:19.657 --> 02:36:22.777]  Larry, you were talking earlier, this is exactly who they love.
[02:36:23.338 --> 02:36:24.418]  He's friends with the Clintons.
[02:36:24.438 --> 02:36:27.279]  Bill Clinton has said it's going to be a sweetheart race between the two.
[02:36:27.939 --> 02:36:32.440]  What do you think's happening here with McCain and how the media and the establishment is firmly behind him?
[02:36:32.480 --> 02:36:36.561]  Is it because they can destroy him any minute so they know he's totally compromised?
[02:36:37.001 --> 02:36:38.722]  Well, he's totally blackmailable.
[02:36:42.011 --> 02:36:46.413]  I mean, that's exactly what the sergeant's talking about.
[02:36:49.815 --> 02:36:51.176]  Continue, Mr. Sampling.
[02:36:52.056 --> 02:36:55.998]  Well, in Special Forces, my training was very extensive.
[02:36:57.179 --> 02:36:59.700]  I spent seven years in Special Forces out of my ten years in the Army.
[02:37:00.100 --> 02:37:05.863]  Part of my training was, at Fort Huachuca, Arizona, Operations Intelligence School, I was trained as an interrogator.
[02:37:06.243 --> 02:37:07.624]  I was trained on what to look for.
[02:37:07.644 --> 02:37:11.406]  I was also trained in what to try to achieve with a
[02:37:12.636 --> 02:37:13.117]  A prisoner.
[02:37:13.257 --> 02:37:17.299]  And one of the things you want to achieve is to neutralize them, and then control them.
[02:37:17.739 --> 02:37:27.543]  And the way you do that is you get them to do something they're not supposed to, or get them to do something against one of the other prisoners, and then you hold that over his head.
[02:37:27.563 --> 02:37:32.906]  Well, I'm going to tell this other prisoner you're the one that told on him, and it caused him to get the mess beat out of him, if you don't tell me some more.
[02:37:33.746 --> 02:37:34.867]  And then he's caught in this trap.
[02:37:34.907 --> 02:37:37.068]  He has to keep talking, and keep talking, and keep talking.
[02:37:37.428 --> 02:37:39.009]  That's the position that McCain is in.
[02:37:39.608 --> 02:37:43.469]  When it comes to what happened in the Hanoi Hiltons.
[02:37:43.569 --> 02:37:45.810]  And there's no doubt they're still controlling him today.
[02:37:46.250 --> 02:37:52.272]  Well, he went back to Vietnam and in front of witnesses, Bob Dornan, former congressman Bob Dornan, would tell you this.
[02:37:54.112 --> 02:38:00.754]  McCain said to the Vietnamese in front of them, if you ever release my files, you'll never see normalized relations.
[02:38:01.214 --> 02:38:06.556]  Then he came back to the United States and used his authority as a senator to get all the POW records sealed.
[02:38:09.802 --> 02:38:13.083]  How many men at that time, when he got those sealed, do we know were left behind?
[02:38:13.103 --> 02:38:23.406]  The number has varied depending on who's counting, but Senator Bob Smith and former Congressman Billy Hendon, they're coming up with the numbers that could be as two or three hundred.
[02:38:23.786 --> 02:38:29.108]  We know there was a second tier of prisoners, a secret tier, that none of the other prisoners knew about.
[02:38:29.128 --> 02:38:33.609]  The Soviets were very interested in our pilots, because at that time,
[02:38:34.099 --> 02:38:37.640]  Our pilots were zooming in and getting through the SAM system, the missile system.
[02:38:37.660 --> 02:38:39.640]  That was the same system that was defending Moscow.
[02:38:41.100 --> 02:38:44.501]  And so they were very interested in what they could get out of these pilots.
[02:38:44.961 --> 02:38:46.361]  And they got a lot.
[02:38:46.541 --> 02:38:47.442]  And all of that is sealed.
[02:38:47.822 --> 02:38:49.382]  McCain's not the only one that collaborated.
[02:38:49.402 --> 02:38:50.962]  A lot of them did.
[02:38:50.982 --> 02:38:59.484]  And Mr. Sampley, you do realize that they have cheapened the word hero with John McCain.
[02:39:00.134 --> 02:39:00.774]  Absolutely.
[02:39:00.954 --> 02:39:02.935]  He got a silver star, and I can trace it.
[02:39:03.216 --> 02:39:12.060]  The dates he got the silver star, I read the citation, were the same dates that he, quote-unquote, was trading military information for better medical care.
[02:39:13.421 --> 02:39:15.922]  Well, his daddy was the head of the Pacific Fleet.
[02:39:16.302 --> 02:39:18.063]  And his granddaddy was a famous Admiral, also.
[02:39:18.083 --> 02:39:18.783]  Wow.
[02:39:20.604 --> 02:39:21.525]  That's why he got that.
[02:39:21.865 --> 02:39:29.769]  Now, the problem is, Mr. Champlain, and I am for you, I support you, I honor you.
[02:39:32.168 --> 02:39:38.891]  But what they're going to do now, after the Swift Boat deal, you know what you're up against.
[02:39:39.692 --> 02:39:40.172]  Absolutely.
[02:39:40.232 --> 02:39:43.074]  I was involved in the Swift Boat deal against John Kerry.
[02:39:43.094 --> 02:39:43.914]  I was one of the leaders.
[02:39:44.534 --> 02:39:47.996]  We just reinvented the organization and turned it against John McCain.
[02:39:48.076 --> 02:39:50.337]  Oh, so you know... John O'Neill.
[02:39:50.918 --> 02:39:51.238]  Yeah.
[02:39:52.138 --> 02:39:56.040]  And you know, this time, the media's going to be ready for you.
[02:39:56.340 --> 02:39:58.681]  They're blasting us left and right.
[02:39:58.701 --> 02:39:59.942]  Then you know Dr. Corsi, right?
[02:40:02.242 --> 02:40:03.283]  Yeah, he's a regular guest here.
[02:40:04.704 --> 02:40:05.465]  Let me say this now.
[02:40:06.906 --> 02:40:18.775]  We are planning right now a counter-offensive, and we're going online on the internet probably tomorrow or the next day, but we're opening an offensive called GOP Tea Party.
[02:40:20.196 --> 02:40:25.560]  And in the spirit of 1773, when the colonists rebelled against the King of England and tossed all that tea over,
[02:40:26.004 --> 02:40:29.366]  We're going to rebel against the Republican Party, and we're going to toss McCain over.
[02:40:29.626 --> 02:40:37.850]  We hope to make it so hot before McCain between now and September, the convention, that this Republican establishment is really going to be rethinking this thing.
[02:40:37.870 --> 02:40:39.291]  But they're all dropping out.
[02:40:39.411 --> 02:40:41.472]  Are you going to go for Huckabee or Paul?
[02:40:41.512 --> 02:40:43.253]  Here's what we're going to do.
[02:40:43.833 --> 02:40:47.835]  We only got to move 5-10% of the conservative Republican base.
[02:40:48.295 --> 02:40:55.619]  Simply get people to pledge that they will not vote for McCain under any circumstances, and sign a pledge to that.
[02:40:56.565 --> 02:40:57.486]  Here's the deal, sir.
[02:40:57.646 --> 02:40:58.806]  I don't believe these polls.
[02:40:58.826 --> 02:40:59.847]  I think something's changed.
[02:40:59.887 --> 02:41:00.908]  We've seen evidence of fraud.
[02:41:01.468 --> 02:41:02.829]  I know Republicans.
[02:41:03.009 --> 02:41:05.811]  I'm on a whole bunch of stations, and I do interviews all the time on other stations.
[02:41:06.451 --> 02:41:08.572]  I can't find Republicans that support McCain.
[02:41:08.692 --> 02:41:10.994]  I don't believe that he's actually winning.
[02:41:11.054 --> 02:41:16.817]  He's winning with less than 30% of the, or about 30% of the Republicans.
[02:41:16.837 --> 02:41:20.059]  Well, as bad as Romney is, he was better than McCain, and now he's dropped out.
[02:41:21.100 --> 02:41:25.122]  People don't understand or don't realize that there are a lot of left-leaning Republicans now.
[02:41:25.529 --> 02:41:29.031]  We have gotten, the Republican Party has digressed.
[02:41:29.551 --> 02:41:37.235]  So one of our objectives is, the Tea Party, is to jettison all of them and reestablish the conservative Republican Party.
[02:41:38.055 --> 02:41:42.718]  And McCain is, the people rallying around McCain are left to center.
[02:41:44.158 --> 02:41:47.100]  So you're going to do this but you're not going to be able to support a candidate?
[02:41:47.120 --> 02:41:49.041]  I mean, Ron Paul?
[02:41:49.521 --> 02:41:52.903]  No, the only pledge is, we'll not vote for John McCain.
[02:41:55.351 --> 02:41:57.693]  I mean, if Ron Paul jumps up there, vote for Ron Paul.
[02:41:58.013 --> 02:41:58.413]  I understand.
[02:41:58.433 --> 02:42:02.536]  Well, that's who I will, but I mean... If he jumps up there, I probably will too.
[02:42:03.337 --> 02:42:05.718]  We better get this word out really fast.
[02:42:06.659 --> 02:42:08.100]  I wonder if all the... We got to September.
[02:42:08.840 --> 02:42:12.703]  I wonder if all the fake mainline Republicans are going to have you on.
[02:42:12.723 --> 02:42:13.103]  They better.
[02:42:13.784 --> 02:42:17.326]  Well, I'm doing quite a few radio shows.
[02:42:17.386 --> 02:42:21.609]  I'm doing one or two a day in sizable radio shows, and I appreciate you guys inviting me.
[02:42:23.419 --> 02:42:24.399]  This is news, by the way.
[02:42:24.440 --> 02:42:29.883]  This is the first time we've announced this program, this campaign we're starting, but we're going to be on the line.
[02:42:29.943 --> 02:42:32.085]  It's GOPTeaParty.com.
[02:42:32.305 --> 02:42:33.166]  Give us all the details.
[02:42:33.186 --> 02:42:33.786]  You've got the floor.
[02:42:33.846 --> 02:42:34.587]  Break it down for us.
[02:42:34.847 --> 02:42:36.568]  Well, we're setting up a website.
[02:42:36.628 --> 02:42:37.809]  It should be ready in two or three days.
[02:42:38.329 --> 02:42:47.616]  GOPTeaParty.com in the spirit of 1773 when the Boston Tea Party, when the colonists rebelled against the King of England,
[02:42:48.311 --> 02:42:50.453]  We're going to rebel against the Republican Party.
[02:42:50.693 --> 02:42:59.459]  We're going to start a revolution within the Republican Party to cleanse it of all the left-leaning Republicans.
[02:43:01.061 --> 02:43:02.962]  They're showing themselves around McCain right now.
[02:43:03.222 --> 02:43:05.524]  And McCain, I don't care what you say, is a leftist.
[02:43:06.605 --> 02:43:08.506]  If you look at his major activity.
[02:43:08.566 --> 02:43:11.468]  Well, what he is is a globalist New World Order minion.
[02:43:12.029 --> 02:43:17.453]  Well, let's say what you're doing, Mr. Stanley, is smart.
[02:43:19.409 --> 02:43:23.851]  You see, people believe because you say you're a Republican, you're a Republican.
[02:43:24.831 --> 02:43:25.172]  Exactly.
[02:43:25.252 --> 02:43:27.493]  You're not!
[02:43:27.533 --> 02:43:29.533]  Lindsey Graham's not a Republican.
[02:43:29.553 --> 02:43:38.838]  We have drifted so far, the Republican Party has drifted so far to the left that we didn't even realize it.
[02:43:39.118 --> 02:43:41.939]  But McCain has exposed everybody.
[02:43:41.959 --> 02:43:46.581]  You know, I was just reading a McHale-Malcolm article
[02:43:46.997 --> 02:43:52.601]  Well, she connects John McCain and his Reform Institute to that multi-million dollar, what is it, Soros?
[02:43:53.182 --> 02:43:54.083]  George Soros, yeah.
[02:43:54.323 --> 02:44:00.487]  With donating money to McCain's Institute, and some of McCain's staffers right now work for that Institute.
[02:44:00.628 --> 02:44:02.429]  But see, that's Clinton.
[02:44:03.410 --> 02:44:06.052]  Yeah, that would go back to the Clinton connection.
[02:44:06.112 --> 02:44:07.773]  McCain is involved with those same people.
[02:44:07.873 --> 02:44:09.915]  Sir, I mean, I don't know if you know this, but I'm sure you do.
[02:44:10.375 --> 02:44:16.580]  Remember back in the last two Clinton elections, McCain's wife kept getting caught campaigning for fundraising and wearing Hillary pins?
[02:44:17.375 --> 02:44:18.156]  No, I don't remember that.
[02:44:19.196 --> 02:44:19.677]  Look it up.
[02:44:20.537 --> 02:44:23.580]  I don't know.
[02:44:23.900 --> 02:44:32.186]  Well, I mean, look, it's the Republican Party itself wants big government and they want, you know, all this corporate welfare.
[02:44:32.926 --> 02:44:33.807]  And I'm sorry.
[02:44:33.827 --> 02:44:41.673]  I mean, have you seen the reports about Roger Ailes and the head of the owner of Fox, Rupert Murdoch, having fundraisers for Hillary?
[02:44:42.293 --> 02:44:44.335]  No, I haven't seen that.
[02:44:46.061 --> 02:44:55.571]  The problem, gentlemen, that we have is that as a nation, as a nation, we're running out of time.
[02:44:55.891 --> 02:44:56.592]  We've been betrayed.
[02:44:56.612 --> 02:44:57.392]  We've been infiltrated.
[02:44:58.694 --> 02:45:00.275]  We've allowed it to happen, unfortunately.
[02:45:00.796 --> 02:45:04.199]  But we do have an army.
[02:45:04.880 --> 02:45:08.944]  We do have an army that we've never had before.
[02:45:10.447 --> 02:45:20.418]  And that is a huge army of people that are now unemployed, underemployed, scared that they're going to lose their job.
[02:45:20.438 --> 02:45:25.023]  Houses being repossessed.
[02:45:26.965 --> 02:45:30.449]  So for the first time, Mr. Stanley, you got an army.
[02:45:32.904 --> 02:45:33.985]  Well, he does have an army.
[02:45:34.025 --> 02:45:38.390]  He is the Vice President of Rolling Thunder Motorcycle Rally, Washington, D.C.
[02:45:38.410 --> 02:45:41.693]  I mean, you guys have gotten how many people out on their motorcycles many times?
[02:45:42.094 --> 02:45:45.037]  Well, this past Memorial Day weekend, we probably had 600,000.
[02:45:45.077 --> 02:45:51.804]  That has turned into, and I'm one of the founders of Rolling Thunder, and that's turned into one of the largest
[02:45:53.979 --> 02:45:55.360]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:46:17.463 --> 02:46:19.485]  And do something like political.
[02:46:19.965 --> 02:46:21.126]  We have to be very careful of that.
[02:46:21.367 --> 02:46:32.516]  But at Vietnam Veterans Against McCain, which is VietnamVeteransAgainstJohnMcCain.com, and we'll get links to that up on the websites, people could get in there and expose him.
[02:46:33.017 --> 02:46:34.438]  Sure.
[02:46:35.219 --> 02:46:39.042]  And then people are reading, we're getting plenty of people reading our website.
[02:46:39.062 --> 02:46:44.647]  It's gotten off to a small start, like a pebble tossed out in a little pond, a little ripple started, but it's getting bigger and bigger.
[02:46:45.282 --> 02:46:48.684]  And so it's similar to what happened when we went up against John Kerry.
[02:46:48.704 --> 02:46:50.405]  We were the first to open up on John Kerry.
[02:46:50.705 --> 02:46:51.826]  We took a lot of crap.
[02:46:51.846 --> 02:46:57.429]  Same stuff that's still being thrown at us about McCain, was thrown at us about John Kerry.
[02:46:57.769 --> 02:47:02.531]  We weathered it, and the next thing you know, the Swift boats, John O'Neill's crowd jumped in, and they just took it on home.
[02:47:02.832 --> 02:47:04.913]  But let's be clear.
[02:47:06.274 --> 02:47:11.757]  In my opinion, and we're talking about these globalists, it's all the same, McCain is much worse than even Kerry.
[02:47:12.317 --> 02:47:12.477]  Yes.
[02:47:13.325 --> 02:47:15.686]  Because we know where Kerry's going.
[02:47:15.726 --> 02:47:16.806]  McCain is a deceiver.
[02:47:18.407 --> 02:47:19.467]  He is the great deceiver.
[02:47:20.067 --> 02:47:20.887]  You can't trust him.
[02:47:22.768 --> 02:47:30.991]  And I want to remind people that McCain was only just one little breath away from accepting the vice president position with John Kerry.
[02:47:31.271 --> 02:47:36.232]  He was actually shielding John Kerry from the swift boat bit.
[02:47:36.292 --> 02:47:38.193]  So you're hoping that by the convention,
[02:47:39.236 --> 02:47:43.279]  I mean, what do you do if he's got all the delegates and Romney and others who's just as bad?
[02:47:44.679 --> 02:47:45.460]  We don't care.
[02:47:46.060 --> 02:48:00.829]  We know if we can move from five to ten percent of the Republicans that normally vote to say, I'm not going to vote for McCain, that will cause McCain to lose and the Republicans to lose.
[02:48:01.089 --> 02:48:08.674]  The Republican establishment knows that, and if they see that coming into the convention, they're going to have to do some tap dancing, and we hope they're going to eject
[02:48:09.266 --> 02:48:10.186]  We're good to go.
[02:48:29.312 --> 02:48:30.013]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:30.033 --> 02:48:30.573]  A new world order.
[02:48:30.613 --> 02:48:33.155]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a power of government.
[02:48:55.876 --> 02:48:58.018]  It's known as the Bilderberg Theory.
[02:48:58.698 --> 02:49:00.920]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[02:49:01.481 --> 02:49:03.943]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:49:04.663 --> 02:49:11.989]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:14.998 --> 02:49:20.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:20.460 --> 02:49:23.941]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:24.321 --> 02:49:26.802]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:49:26.882 --> 02:49:28.042]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:28.062 --> 02:49:28.822]  They're not after money.
[02:49:28.842 --> 02:49:29.903]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:30.123 --> 02:49:30.863]  They're after power.
[02:49:31.083 --> 02:49:31.963]  That's what they're after.
[02:49:32.243 --> 02:49:36.785]  Order In Game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[02:49:37.005 --> 02:49:40.446]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:49:40.566 --> 02:49:43.307]  In Game, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:49:43.867 --> 02:49:45.008]  You have been warned.
[02:49:47.289 --> 02:49:51.332]  Do you need more than just the constant news of impending tyranny?
[02:49:52.112 --> 02:49:59.977]  Yes, this is Elizabeth Porter, back with The Divided Kingdom, the hour that analyzes spiritual and cultural issues too.
[02:50:00.458 --> 02:50:05.781]  Lou Blanchard and I are delighted, thanks in large part to past listeners' lobbying efforts,
[02:50:06.534 --> 02:50:12.537]  Now to be on the great Genesis Communications Network Monday through Friday at 6 p.m.
[02:50:12.617 --> 02:50:13.117]  Central.
[02:50:13.518 --> 02:50:19.881]  Formidable Alex Jones says, this is a network often imitated but never duplicated.
[02:50:20.561 --> 02:50:26.904]  Lou and I made the conscious decision to move to GCN because of its classy lineup and leadership.
[02:50:27.424 --> 02:50:32.467]  We invite you to hear our program, one we pray will strengthen and bless you.
[02:50:33.266 --> 02:50:38.771]  Indeed, trouble is part of the story, but the fellowship of faith surpasses it.
[02:50:39.152 --> 02:50:40.553]  Tune in at 6 p.m.
[02:50:40.633 --> 02:50:42.675]  Central with The Divided Kingdom.
[02:50:45.675 --> 02:50:46.155]  Hi, Ken.
[02:50:46.195 --> 02:50:46.976]  It's Judy again.
[02:50:46.996 --> 02:50:51.518]  I just wanted to call you back and let you know how thankful Mike and I are for your working with us.
[02:50:51.678 --> 02:50:54.819]  You know the Sun Oven we ordered from you on KenSolar.com?
[02:50:55.039 --> 02:50:56.920]  It cooks all of our food and then some.
[02:50:57.200 --> 02:50:59.261]  Plus, we just sold the old gas barbecue.
[02:50:59.441 --> 02:51:05.564]  Also, the solar-powered generator reduced our electric bill just like you said it would, and it's powering my whole studio right now.
[02:51:05.744 --> 02:51:11.047]  We don't have to worry about our food going bad or surviving the outages anymore, either of which is huge.
[02:51:11.327 --> 02:51:14.188]  Well, Ken, I'll cut this one short for now, and thanks again.
[02:51:14.308 --> 02:51:15.229]  Go KenSolar!
[02:51:16.528 --> 02:51:18.068]  Get the best of both worlds.
[02:51:18.448 --> 02:51:23.549]  Solar power for your household essentials and a backup generator all-in-one.
[02:51:23.569 --> 02:51:25.130]  Perfect for hurricane seasons.
[02:51:25.150 --> 02:51:28.950]  No long gas lines, no fumes and no noise.
[02:51:29.650 --> 02:51:32.331]  Lower your electric bill and be prepared year-round.
[02:51:32.971 --> 02:51:35.311]  Complete solar kits for under $1,200.
[02:51:35.551 --> 02:51:39.652]  See the complete solar power generator kit at KenSolar.com.
[02:51:39.812 --> 02:51:43.633]  Order your solar power generator from Ken's website at KenSolar.com.
[02:51:49.173 --> 02:51:51.155]  I want to thank Larry Nichols for spending time with us today.
[02:51:51.175 --> 02:51:52.976]  We're going to have a final word from him in a moment.
[02:51:54.537 --> 02:51:56.839]  And I hope that you'll take his words very serious.
[02:51:57.719 --> 02:52:00.861]  We weren't taking calls during this interview, and I had a call into the board.
[02:52:01.602 --> 02:52:04.324]  Somebody got the back line going, this guy is incredible, blah, blah, blah.
[02:52:04.924 --> 02:52:09.908]  I've checked out everything he's talking about, and you just, I guess, weren't around during the whole Clinton scandals.
[02:52:10.448 --> 02:52:10.789]  OK?
[02:52:11.129 --> 02:52:13.190]  This guy had the media go over him with a fine-toothed comb.
[02:52:13.210 --> 02:52:15.392]  He's the guy that released all the big scandals.
[02:52:16.320 --> 02:52:27.130]  He did do the things he said he did, and I want to say something to the Free Republic people, and even some of the World Night Daily folks, and all of them that have sold out to the neocons that think all this is cute.
[02:52:27.150 --> 02:52:30.072]  You've been gamed by the Puppet Masters, as Larry says.
[02:52:31.794 --> 02:52:36.157]  As much as I like this other group going after McCain, and he is bad, they're putting him in.
[02:52:36.758 --> 02:52:41.202]  And they mean for him to fail, and for Ann Coulter to now endorse Hillary.
[02:52:41.838 --> 02:52:42.639]  And for that to happen.
[02:52:42.659 --> 02:52:46.721]  Now, we could shoot down McCain early and... I hate to play lesser of two evils.
[02:52:46.781 --> 02:52:50.524]  I mean, Huckabee, even though he's CFR, would be better than this guy.
[02:52:50.544 --> 02:52:52.385]  I mean, you can't get any worse than McCain.
[02:52:52.865 --> 02:52:53.846]  But he's a Clintonista.
[02:52:53.886 --> 02:52:55.107]  He's in bed with them completely.
[02:52:55.787 --> 02:52:57.048]  Just like Fox News is.
[02:52:57.148 --> 02:52:58.709]  And good job, Freepers, all of you.
[02:52:58.869 --> 02:53:00.050]  You've helped destroy the country.
[02:53:00.771 --> 02:53:05.674]  You just love to hate Islamofascist so much when our own boys, our own system, created it.
[02:53:06.252 --> 02:53:08.293]  Larry Nichols, final comments on the point I just made.
[02:53:08.713 --> 02:53:12.954]  Well, first off, too, Sergeant Stanley, what a terrific hero.
[02:53:13.835 --> 02:53:14.515]  It don't matter.
[02:53:14.535 --> 02:53:16.516]  He ain't going in.
[02:53:16.576 --> 02:53:18.616]  McCain's not be there to go in.
[02:53:18.676 --> 02:53:19.737]  Hillary's going in.
[02:53:20.357 --> 02:53:21.497]  That's where we fight.
[02:53:21.737 --> 02:53:23.258]  Congress is where we win.
[02:53:23.278 --> 02:53:30.500]  And to the people that don't believe, look, my life's an open book.
[02:53:32.561 --> 02:53:33.201]  I don't hide.
[02:53:33.221 --> 02:53:35.582]  I don't hide my phone number.
[02:53:36.417 --> 02:53:37.858]  I don't have my phone.
[02:53:37.898 --> 02:53:39.099]  I don't have my address.
[02:53:42.282 --> 02:54:00.396]  And as Alex knows, from the BBC to Good God, the Washington Post, to the New York Times, to the Time Magazine, to NBC, CBS, 60 Minutes.
[02:54:02.117 --> 02:54:02.718]  Look, folks.
[02:54:03.726 --> 02:54:07.929]  If they'd spotted me telling one little fib, it'd have been over.
[02:54:10.872 --> 02:54:11.732]  It ain't over yet.
[02:54:13.674 --> 02:54:15.876]  Well, Larry, I'm not going to wait five years to have you back on.
[02:54:15.896 --> 02:54:23.662]  I want to get you back up in the next few weeks, because you're THE cleansing expert, and I just really appreciate all the fine work that you've done, my friend.
[02:54:23.682 --> 02:54:26.284]  Go ahead and give out your number for other talk shows that may want to interview you.
[02:54:26.304 --> 02:54:26.344]  501-329-1159.
[02:54:34.065 --> 02:54:34.806]  Thank you so much.
[02:54:35.166 --> 02:54:36.107]  Larry Nichols, take care.
[02:54:36.127 --> 02:54:36.987]  Thank you.
[02:54:39.349 --> 02:54:41.351]  Folks, the show's basically over.
[02:54:42.292 --> 02:54:46.055]  If you missed any of the first or second hour, it was all invaluable information.
[02:54:46.115 --> 02:54:48.056]  I mean, very important show today.
[02:54:48.436 --> 02:54:50.438]  The second hour was off the charts important.
[02:54:50.458 --> 02:54:51.319]  Call everybody you know.
[02:54:51.439 --> 02:54:52.299]  Email your email list.
[02:54:52.600 --> 02:54:53.320]  That's how we grow.
[02:54:53.380 --> 02:54:54.301]  It's how we reach more people.
[02:54:54.821 --> 02:54:56.223]  Tell them to go to the newinfowars.com.
[02:54:57.458 --> 02:55:00.841]  Tell them to go to PrisonPlanet.com, JonesReport.com, get this information.
[02:55:00.881 --> 02:55:02.522]  We know what the globalists are doing.
[02:55:02.542 --> 02:55:03.243]  We understand.
[02:55:03.283 --> 02:55:05.485]  We tell you decades before what's going to happen.
[02:55:06.185 --> 02:55:06.585]  We know.
[02:55:06.705 --> 02:55:07.926]  We're the people that know.
[02:55:08.107 --> 02:55:09.268]  This is what we do full-time.
[02:55:10.048 --> 02:55:10.829]  This is who we are.
[02:55:13.431 --> 02:55:25.901]  And some of the greatest assets we have are people that work for the system, who when they saw dead children, that's always the story we get, just finally had their Saul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus moment.
[02:55:28.760 --> 02:55:33.743]  So please, when the show ends in about two minutes, go to InfoWars.com if you missed any of it.
[02:55:33.763 --> 02:55:34.944]  There's the streams right there.
[02:55:35.224 --> 02:55:36.145]  The show's going to restart.
[02:55:38.126 --> 02:55:40.407]  Also, I have produced 18 films.
[02:55:40.427 --> 02:55:41.668]  That's how we fund this operation.
[02:55:41.708 --> 02:55:43.449]  I've been so busy lately, I haven't even been plugging them.
[02:55:43.469 --> 02:55:54.576]  You can see them online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv and get a membership for 15 cents a day, get a couple months free when you sign up for a year, or just get a trial monthly for $5.95.
[02:55:54.816 --> 02:55:57.098]  That supports us, but the most important thing is the info.
[02:55:57.794 --> 02:56:06.156]  Or get hard copies of the DVDs, books, films we carry, not just the films I made, at InfoWars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:56:06.256 --> 02:56:12.858]  They're bringing in martial law, they're bringing down the country.
[02:56:13.739 --> 02:56:17.300]  I agree with him, the economic attack is worse than any terror attack.
[02:56:17.760 --> 02:56:18.480]  And they're attacking us.
[02:56:19.295 --> 02:56:20.216]  Balls in your court?
[02:56:20.656 --> 02:56:21.537]  God bless you all.
[02:56:21.657 --> 02:56:24.480]  Retransmission starts now at InfoWars.com.
[02:56:24.540 --> 02:56:28.203]  Thank you for listening to GPN.
