[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.170]  Check out the huge discounts.
[00:00:18.564 --> 00:00:27.251]  The same globalists that engineered World War I, World War II, that put the communists into power in China and now admit it,
[00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:43.974]  They are setting up a global killing field to have their way with us.
[00:00:48.334 --> 00:00:52.055]  They are setting up a global police state to carry out eugenics operations against us.
[00:00:52.836 --> 00:01:02.879]  While we suck our thumbs and argue about just exactly who runs the whole global crime syndicate, and the answer is evil people, working together in combine, they're busy carrying out their operation.
[00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:11.082]  We need to warn the people with the basic info to wake up the biggest mass of people we can to discredit the government, discredit the elites, and then move on to the next level.
[00:01:11.502 --> 00:01:14.403]  That's always been my goal, and thank God we've been effective to some extent.
[00:01:14.763 --> 00:01:20.005]  We'll be even more effective if you get involved in the fight out there, some of you that have been on the bench, and come in for the big win.
[00:01:20.025 --> 00:01:22.946]  Let's take a few calls where Celica Stillo joins us with big news.
[00:01:23.386 --> 00:01:26.707]  Chris in Texas, then John, John, Chris, Fred, and others.
[00:01:26.747 --> 00:01:28.268]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Chris.
[00:01:29.448 --> 00:01:31.649]  Hi Alex, I just had a couple of quick things.
[00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:37.111]  One was I'm waiting on the edge of my seat for something from Jim Tucker.
[00:01:37.771 --> 00:01:40.292]  I was wondering if you had heard anything or I missed it?
[00:01:41.710 --> 00:02:00.579]  I got Jim's home phone number and I got his office number and we told him three times the time zone and he said he'd be on at 1 our time and then he thought it was 1 his time and then he's off today and he's not answering at home and I really think him and Estalin are trying to find out what really happened and if they did meet last week and I don't think they know.
[00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:02.840]  And I think that's why it's kind of hard to get them on.
[00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.201]  But we had him lined up and then he wasn't here.
[00:02:05.662 --> 00:02:08.463]  So we'll find out either Sunday or Monday, you should know.
[00:02:09.804 --> 00:02:10.184]  Okay.
[00:02:10.524 --> 00:02:24.072]  Another quick thing I had was in Burma, with the juntas, I mean, what country in their right mind would let American military come in?
[00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:27.595]  Well, I mean, four days into it, they were saying we were bad.
[00:02:28.595 --> 00:02:31.217]  I mean, that they were bad for not letting the, quote, U.S.
[00:02:31.237 --> 00:02:31.457]  in.
[00:02:31.777 --> 00:02:35.319]  But our own government for five days gave no aid in Katrina and then came and took guns.
[00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.759]  Go ahead.
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.940]  That's right.
[00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:40.633]  Are we really trying that hard?
[00:02:40.673 --> 00:02:47.719]  I mean, can't it be part of the big plan to let a lot of people die?
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.621]  You know what?
[00:02:51.642 --> 00:02:54.364]  Governments can't help you and they won't help you even if they could.
[00:02:54.384 --> 00:02:55.425]  Yeah.
[00:02:55.685 --> 00:02:56.606]  And that's just what they are.
[00:02:56.646 --> 00:02:58.608]  They're a bunch of dirty parasites and that's it.
[00:02:59.554 --> 00:02:59.754]  Yeah.
[00:03:00.034 --> 00:03:01.595]  They're there to suck and feed off of you.
[00:03:02.335 --> 00:03:08.518]  Most of the lower level people are idiots who couldn't make it in the free market, and the rest of them are a bunch of control freak criminals that want to suck off people.
[00:03:08.618 --> 00:03:09.659]  Now, that's on average.
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.080]  Anything else?
[00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:13.421]  That's it.
[00:03:13.801 --> 00:03:14.601]  Hey, good to hear from you.
[00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:15.542]  I appreciate you calling.
[00:03:16.002 --> 00:03:18.663]  Let's go ahead now, and who's up next here in line?
[00:03:20.084 --> 00:03:21.145]  John in New York, first timer.
[00:03:21.525 --> 00:03:22.845]  John in New York, first timer.
[00:03:23.045 --> 00:03:23.586]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:03:26.787 --> 00:03:27.087]  Hello?
[00:03:27.268 --> 00:03:27.908]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[00:03:29.142 --> 00:03:32.405]  Alex Jones, this is John Paul, and we are Change New York.
[00:03:32.445 --> 00:03:33.706]  I'm in the airport here in New York.
[00:03:33.746 --> 00:03:35.147]  I'm coming down to see your new movie.
[00:03:35.668 --> 00:03:38.050]  I can't wait for 9-11 Chronicles, Truth Rising.
[00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.252]  Alex, I want to say to everybody in the truth movement, truth is rising.
[00:03:41.633 --> 00:03:42.533]  Liberty is rising.
[00:03:42.674 --> 00:03:43.694]  Sovereignty is rising.
[00:03:44.395 --> 00:03:49.739]  And when it comes to its peak, we're going to be more powerful than the New World Order ever hoped they'd be.
[00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.582]  And the tyranny is never going to have a dream of coming again.
[00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:54.711]  And everybody in We Are Change, I love you.
[00:03:54.952 --> 00:03:56.794]  And everybody in the Ron Paul crowd, I love you.
[00:03:57.215 --> 00:03:59.297]  And let's keep doing it, and we're going to do it all the way.
[00:03:59.317 --> 00:04:00.579]  I'm with you every day, Alex.
[00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.122]  This is the first time I ever got through to you, but I'm with you every day, brother.
[00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:03.663]  Well, you're awesome.
[00:04:03.683 --> 00:04:07.588]  Hey, I hope you've already got your tickets, because the Saturday's sold out and the Sunday's getting close.
[00:04:08.624 --> 00:04:14.869]  All right, well, I'll see what the boys in Austin can do for me, but I hope to see you, Alex, and God bless everybody out there.
[00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.750]  You bet.
[00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:16.210]  You bet.
[00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.271]  I appreciate your call.
[00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:24.917]  It almost discourages people to come, because 90-plus percent of the time, we turn away hundreds from each showing.
[00:04:25.618 --> 00:04:27.740]  And then people stop going because they think they can't get in.
[00:04:28.521 --> 00:04:31.343]  And then every once in a while we have a show that doesn't fill up because of that.
[00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:33.625]  But they hold like 20 tickets at the door.
[00:04:34.005 --> 00:04:35.106]  So there's 20 tickets left.
[00:04:35.446 --> 00:04:38.209]  They'll sell the hour before it opens, Saturday.
[00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:39.430]  Same thing on Sunday.
[00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.832]  And they set out a few folding chairs sometimes too.
[00:04:41.872 --> 00:04:42.672]  They try to get you in.
[00:04:45.255 --> 00:04:46.255]  I'll be there giving a speech.
[00:04:46.275 --> 00:04:47.657]  We'll be right back with Sullivan Stillo.
[00:04:54.511 --> 00:04:55.912]  It is a big idea.
[00:04:56.212 --> 00:04:57.192]  Hundreds from each showing.
[00:04:57.892 --> 00:05:00.033]  And then people stop going because they think they can't get in.
[00:05:00.794 --> 00:05:03.595]  And then every once in a while we have a show that doesn't fill up because of that.
[00:05:04.335 --> 00:05:05.896]  But they hold like 20 tickets at the door.
[00:05:06.276 --> 00:05:07.336]  So there's 20 tickets left.
[00:05:07.717 --> 00:05:10.478]  They'll sell the hour before it opens, Saturday.
[00:05:10.798 --> 00:05:11.698]  Same thing on Sunday.
[00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:14.099]  And they set out a few folding chairs sometimes too.
[00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:14.960]  They try to get you in.
[00:05:17.521 --> 00:05:18.521]  I'll be there giving a speech.
[00:05:18.621 --> 00:05:19.942]  We'll be right back with Celica Stillo.
[00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.110]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.251]  A New World Order.
[00:05:30.951 --> 00:05:35.173]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:05:35.813 --> 00:05:38.634]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:05:38.674 --> 00:05:40.854]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:05:41.455 --> 00:05:43.895]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:51.958]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:54.989 --> 00:05:59.952]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:06:00.433 --> 00:06:03.915]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:06:04.295 --> 00:06:06.797]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:06:06.857 --> 00:06:08.018]  Most people have no idea.
[00:06:08.038 --> 00:06:08.798]  They're not after money.
[00:06:08.818 --> 00:06:09.919]  They have all the money they need.
[00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:10.800]  They're after power.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.920]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[00:06:23.748 --> 00:06:24.789]  You have been warned.
[00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:34.736]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:06:34.916 --> 00:06:39.700]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:51.188]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:06:51.588 --> 00:06:57.131]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:06:57.352 --> 00:07:03.435]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[00:07:03.635 --> 00:07:04.276]  What about you?

[00:07:25.464 --> 00:07:31.466]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:07:32.006 --> 00:07:37.888]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business and the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[00:07:38.248 --> 00:07:41.429]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.
[00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:43.911]  Start reading the Nationalist Times each month.
[00:07:44.151 --> 00:07:49.534]  The Nationalist Times promotes a common-sense, intelligent, and passionate alternative to the reigning party line.
[00:07:49.855 --> 00:07:57.080]  Published monthly since 1985, the Nationalist Times is a 20-page newspaper featuring... He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.402]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:11.101 --> 00:08:17.668]  The Associated Press is reporting, The Houston Chronicle is reporting that, quote, U.S.
[00:08:17.688 --> 00:08:22.754]  government trained paramilitary Mexican troops have, quote, turned over to the drug dealers.
[00:08:24.474 --> 00:08:34.777]  Celica Stillo, three years ago, on this very radio show, we wrote articles for PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com, came on and said, no, they've been trained by the U.S.
[00:08:35.217 --> 00:08:38.058]  to go after drug cartels that aren't paying their cut to U.S.
[00:08:38.118 --> 00:08:39.418]  banks, that the U.S.
[00:08:39.458 --> 00:08:41.238]  government's shipping in the majority of the narcotics.
[00:08:41.599 --> 00:08:46.280]  He, of course, is the highest level DEA agent in Latin America, witnessed government narcotics, cocaine shipments.
[00:08:47.518 --> 00:08:47.678]  I don't
[00:09:03.392 --> 00:09:13.114]  And he's written a book, he's been on Nightline and Dateline, all these big shows, exposing, and he's in the film, American Drug War, available at Infowars.com.
[00:09:13.134 --> 00:09:14.215]  It's been airing on Showtime.
[00:09:14.755 --> 00:09:18.896]  The federal prosecutors, when he tried to expose the BATF in South Texas, said, we're coming after you.
[00:09:19.256 --> 00:09:21.897]  They set him up on gun charges and are doing that now.
[00:09:22.337 --> 00:09:26.798]  And our listeners have raised him some well-needed money for a retainer with his lawyer.
[00:09:27.558 --> 00:09:29.479]  And we really salute the listeners for that.
[00:09:45.524 --> 00:09:49.747]  Death squads have been rehired by the CIA to go to Iraq to kill people.
[00:09:50.387 --> 00:09:51.708]  That came out in the mainstream news.
[00:09:52.048 --> 00:09:53.669]  So he just has incredible sources.
[00:09:54.810 --> 00:10:00.434]  Sully, A, have you seen the Houston Chronicle admitting that Congress has admitted that the U.S.
[00:10:00.474 --> 00:10:06.198]  is funding groups, quote, killing American citizens, carrying out hits as, quote, far north as Dallas?
[00:10:07.638 --> 00:10:30.059]  Certainly, like you said it before that I have been talking about this for quite a while and one of the reasons Alex that I happen to know this because when I was working the gun shows and I had access to all kinds of walkers alive that came up here from the set us to US Blackwater guys and so forth that would come up to me and they would tell me that
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:41.692]  They were trained, the people that we trained down in Central America, the Caibiles, the Chinches in South America, they're all coming down here and working for the cartels now.
[00:10:42.152 --> 00:10:43.614]  And it was part of a U.S.
[00:10:43.674 --> 00:10:44.114]  government.
[00:10:44.435 --> 00:10:49.240]  We also had, I don't know if you recall, we had 30 Iraqi, U.S.
[00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:50.061]  Iraqi veterans
[00:10:50.881 --> 00:10:56.627]  They went into Monterrey, Mexico and were involved in a big shootout and all 30 of them got whacked.
[00:10:57.048 --> 00:11:04.175]  And they were all part of working for the paramilitary for the Mexican Army in Monterrey, Mexico.
[00:11:04.536 --> 00:11:08.680]  So that was happening and, you know, those are 30 U.S.
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.483]  veterans that are never to be seen or found again.
[00:11:12.577 --> 00:11:27.084]  Now let's be clear, what percentage, well I've seen numbers as high as 85%, of the cartels work with the big central banks, Chase Manhattan Citibank, Federal Reserve Banks, to launder it and are shipped in on CIA aircraft.
[00:11:27.685 --> 00:11:29.686]  Do you think 80 plus percent is an accurate number?
[00:11:29.946 --> 00:11:35.629]  And then who are some of the cartels and smaller drug dealers that are breaking up their monopoly that they're waging war on?
[00:11:36.149 --> 00:11:41.213]  From what I get from you and others, and what the news is now admitting, this is a cartel war with the U.S.
[00:11:41.253 --> 00:11:44.955]  back, just like they killed the communist FARC in Colombia, because they're not paying the cut.
[00:11:45.276 --> 00:11:49.799]  Explain that to listeners, that there is a drug war, but it's only over who controls the drugs.
[00:11:50.490 --> 00:12:06.885]  Exactly, and basically the military came by and for the first time ever, Alex, you've got to remember that the Mexican military have admitted that they do now have paramilitary people, which is part of some U.S.
[00:12:07.085 --> 00:12:13.611]  mercenaries, and we even have the Mossad Israelis working with the
[00:12:14.592 --> 00:12:18.613]  With the cartels and with the military, paramilitary.
[00:12:18.713 --> 00:12:20.314]  Oh yeah, they're working right here in Austin.
[00:12:20.614 --> 00:12:22.454]  The evidence shows they're killing citizens.
[00:12:23.074 --> 00:12:23.555]  Exactly.
[00:12:23.595 --> 00:12:29.816]  They even had a camp north of Edinburgh, Texas that were training some of these people.
[00:12:30.317 --> 00:12:35.278]  So not only were they training in the south side of the river, but on the north side of the river.
[00:12:35.878 --> 00:12:36.719]  I think so.
[00:12:52.606 --> 00:13:01.632]  And they've also killed a lot of feds and a lot of local police, so the local police now are cowed to them, and that's those that aren't on the payroll.
[00:13:02.292 --> 00:13:02.712]  Exactly.
[00:13:02.732 --> 00:13:10.257]  And not only that, Alex, but they're also have, their intelligence inequities have reached to the highest level.
[00:13:10.317 --> 00:13:11.198]  They have several
[00:13:11.858 --> 00:13:14.339]  Now, when you were on with us three years ago,
[00:13:37.024 --> 00:13:51.496]  You said, when you said this at the time, you said, now they're going to come after me because you trained a lot of these people, you trained the death squads, as you have admitted, then it was too much for you to learn as they were shipping the drugs back, and I guess they have come after you now.
[00:13:51.516 --> 00:13:55.219]  We're going to talk about that in the second half of the interview, but Selly specifically
[00:13:55.819 --> 00:14:04.323]  Tell us about the death squads you trained, and from what I get from you and others, and they admit they're doing hits as far north as Indiana, and other papers that admit it's Indiana.
[00:14:04.383 --> 00:14:07.425]  This Houston Chronicle says killing people, truck bombs in Dallas.
[00:14:07.805 --> 00:14:22.112]  The media keeps it real quiet though, normally, and this is the army of the New World Order now, is going to be Mexican and other Central American paramilitaries, and I want to be very clear about that, and then go over some of your evidence for that.
[00:14:22.612 --> 00:14:26.274]  And how you could report this three years before it came out in mainstream news.
[00:14:26.994 --> 00:14:27.414]  Exactly.
[00:14:28.134 --> 00:14:28.635]  Go ahead.
[00:14:28.655 --> 00:14:41.640]  So, you know Alex, and what happened is the Caibiles, the Ataclad out of El Salvador, all those special forces units that we trained basically are very vicious.
[00:14:42.379 --> 00:14:42.700]  I don't
[00:15:03.881 --> 00:15:26.360]  The Venezuelan advisor that I worked with down in Salvador and Guatemala for six years, he was finally, and he worked for the CIA, he was finally gunned down and his body riddled with bullets three weeks ago in Guatemala because of his, you know, connections with training the death squad.
[00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:28.202]  His group that came in from Venezuela
[00:15:29.156 --> 00:15:38.120]  Back in the 80s, were instrumental in training the death squads and myself with part of the... How were you involved?
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.461]  Explain where you were attached, what you did.
[00:15:40.481 --> 00:15:43.542]  I've seen old photos of you on the helicopters and the news articles.
[00:15:44.283 --> 00:15:51.546]  Well, basically what I was, Alex, I was the advisor to the Guatemalan military G2.
[00:15:53.066 --> 00:16:05.671]  Uh, in other words, the Drug Enforcement Administration was, I was the agent that was liaison, as they say, with the CIA and the, uh, and the dead squads, which was the, uh, Guatemalan, uh, counterintelligence unit.
[00:16:06.171 --> 00:16:12.493]  And basically what we did was when there was no funding, we used DEA funds, um, to train these people.
[00:16:12.573 --> 00:16:14.214]  I'm talking about Dr. Regalao.
[00:16:14.234 --> 00:16:17.755]  Uh, I'm talking about, uh, um, uh,
[00:16:18.818 --> 00:16:19.239]  I don't
[00:16:35.271 --> 00:16:35.872]  I don't
[00:16:54.653 --> 00:17:08.977]  Now before it was even in Central and South American newspapers, you said almost four years ago here that they were going to send tens of thousands and already sent thousands of death squad members and new recruits out of Latin America to Iraq and then it came out in the news years later.
[00:17:09.057 --> 00:17:10.217]  How did you find out about that?
[00:17:11.197 --> 00:17:17.099]  Well, because when they were actually coming down here, Alex, I was being contacted by
[00:17:18.012 --> 00:17:26.916]  By some of the setters and some of the cartels down there about the possibility of me training individuals down in Mexico.
[00:17:27.196 --> 00:17:32.118]  Now, you said you believe they were really trying to set you up to kill you, right?
[00:17:32.438 --> 00:17:33.298]  Well, exactly.
[00:17:33.498 --> 00:17:39.461]  And basically, they did the second best thing and was to incarcerate me now for the rest of my life.
[00:17:39.901 --> 00:17:45.323]  And basically, when I said the word that they were ATF agents,
[00:17:46.064 --> 00:17:46.805]  I don't think so.
[00:18:01.866 --> 00:18:03.106]  Well, you have total credibility.
[00:18:03.126 --> 00:18:15.989]  Not only your presidential awards you've got from Reagan and Bush, and all the news articles, the admissions, and your congressional testimony, and Nightline, and PBS, and Dateline, NBC.
[00:18:16.029 --> 00:18:17.170]  I mean, this is all documented.
[00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:19.230]  He's got a Showtime special on right now.
[00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:21.751]  We have the DVD, not even available in stores yet, but we have it.
[00:18:22.091 --> 00:18:23.011]  The American Drug War.
[00:18:23.451 --> 00:18:27.772]  And Selly told us everything that was going to happen, and you said they were going to use him in the U.S.
[00:18:28.152 --> 00:18:29.993]  Now, who are these cartels they're fighting?
[00:18:32.113 --> 00:18:44.559]  Well, my intel tells me right now that the military is actually now starting to run the cartels.
[00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:50.022]  That's why they came in down to the border and they did the process of elimination thing.
[00:18:50.982 --> 00:18:57.146]  But yet, their cartels are real huge, and when you take one cell out, another one comes in.
[00:18:57.466 --> 00:19:01.828]  Okay, let me stop you, and we'll hold you over past the 30 if you can, because this is so important.
[00:19:01.848 --> 00:19:02.749]  I've got another guest coming on.
[00:19:03.129 --> 00:19:05.010]  That's exactly what all the intel shows.
[00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:09.392]  They used to just let the cartels bring it in, pay their cut, and launder the money.
[00:19:09.632 --> 00:19:10.193]  The U.S.
[00:19:10.233 --> 00:19:14.295]  and Mexican government are now taking full control of the drug war.
[00:19:15.115 --> 00:19:25.099]  I mean, of the drug business, for themselves, just getting rid of the middleman completely, and they're also going to use it as a hitman force here domestically.
[00:19:25.179 --> 00:19:25.840]  Is that accurate?
[00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:27.480]  That's absolutely true.
[00:19:30.282 --> 00:19:30.782]  Unbelievable.
[00:19:30.802 --> 00:19:31.862]  Stay there, Celica Stillo.
[00:19:32.643 --> 00:19:35.524]  We'll give you his website too on the other side.
[00:19:36.894 --> 00:19:37.735]  So there you have it.
[00:19:39.036 --> 00:19:43.360]  And I'll ask someone on the other side, Bush doesn't want to just give Mexico $10 billion for the drug war now.
[00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:45.462]  $146, where is it?
[00:19:45.482 --> 00:19:46.503]  $7, you can Google it.
[00:19:47.063 --> 00:19:49.085]  Billion to, quote, fight drugs.
[00:19:49.205 --> 00:19:52.948]  That's really the buy-off to win the war to control the drugs.
[00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:55.931]  It is a big idea.
[00:19:55.951 --> 00:19:58.053]  A new world order.
[00:19:58.774 --> 00:20:02.397]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by power.
[00:20:03.664 --> 00:20:05.385]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[00:20:06.465 --> 00:20:08.745]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:20:09.266 --> 00:20:11.686]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[00:20:12.446 --> 00:20:19.768]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:20:22.792 --> 00:20:27.777]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:20:28.237 --> 00:20:31.901]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:20:32.101 --> 00:20:34.643]  Build America to make great progress toward a world government.
[00:20:34.683 --> 00:20:35.824]  Most people have no idea.
[00:20:35.844 --> 00:20:36.605]  They're not after money.
[00:20:36.625 --> 00:20:37.726]  They have all the money they need.
[00:20:37.906 --> 00:20:38.667]  They're after power.
[00:20:38.887 --> 00:20:39.768]  That's what Africa needs here.

[00:20:51.819 --> 00:20:56.142]  Hi, John Huebner from Midas Resources.
[00:20:56.402 --> 00:20:59.044]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[00:20:59.344 --> 00:21:07.650]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[00:21:07.951 --> 00:21:10.773]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[00:21:11.613 --> 00:21:14.836]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[00:21:16.157 --> 00:21:17.738]  How much are you willing to lose?
[00:21:18.118 --> 00:21:19.059]  Take action now!

[00:21:24.005 --> 00:21:27.769]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[00:21:27.989 --> 00:21:31.193]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[00:21:31.313 --> 00:21:32.995]  Current Federal Reserve policy and
[00:21:32.995 --> 00:21:33.275]  We're good.
[00:21:53.337 --> 00:21:55.018]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:21:55.298 --> 00:21:58.759]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:21:58.919 --> 00:22:00.700]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:04.102]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:22:04.402 --> 00:22:09.864]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:22:10.144 --> 00:22:14.066]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:22:14.386 --> 00:22:19.310]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.TV is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[00:22:53.436 --> 00:22:56.397]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:22:56.537 --> 00:23:01.778]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:23:02.038 --> 00:23:07.459]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:23:07.779 --> 00:23:08.880]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:18.142]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:23:18.302 --> 00:23:18.522]  Yes!
[00:23:18.562 --> 00:23:20.203]  Now compare Calbin Pure Soap.

[00:23:57.271 --> 00:24:04.076]  Celica Stillo, be with us a few minutes into the next segment, and we got the guy that came up with the idea of the original Ron Paul money bomb joining us.
[00:24:04.577 --> 00:24:06.519]  He decided to do a money bomb for Infowars.
[00:24:07.591 --> 00:24:13.894]  And you better know that every cent of it will go straight into the heart of the New World Order like black arrows being shot into a dragon.
[00:24:17.036 --> 00:24:19.157]  Because that's what I want.
[00:24:19.237 --> 00:24:20.178]  That's my goal.
[00:24:21.138 --> 00:24:23.019]  Is to defeat these arrogant bastards.
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:27.802]  So our country isn't a drug dealing cesspit of government scum.
[00:24:30.703 --> 00:24:31.304]  Well, that's basically it.
[00:24:31.324 --> 00:24:35.047]  Remember that the Colombians were handling the whole thing from the very beginning.
[00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:53.731]  We're good to go.
[00:25:14.256 --> 00:25:15.897]  And they just killed the head of the FARC.
[00:25:15.937 --> 00:25:20.280]  I mean, Richard Grasso, head of the New York Stock Exchange on Reuters, in 1999, hugged him.
[00:25:20.761 --> 00:25:21.861]  There's a special U.S.
[00:25:21.901 --> 00:25:30.627]  law where, this is in mainstream news, where drug money can be laundered through the stock market, but your kid can get caught with one ounce of marijuana, they go to prison.
[00:25:32.108 --> 00:25:36.051]  And they finally killed the head of the FARC, who refused to pay his cut to him.
[00:25:37.472 --> 00:25:39.173]  Exactly, and that's been reported.
[00:25:39.533 --> 00:25:40.174]  I remember when
[00:25:42.029 --> 00:25:42.409]  I don't
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:55.582]  You know, it's called the process of elimination.
[00:25:55.622 --> 00:26:02.628]  You know, they're taking out the middle man now and just go straight to the source of the money.
[00:26:02.808 --> 00:26:08.393]  And we know there's a lot of classified missions where they send in Marines and Army to kill people all over Latin America.
[00:26:08.833 --> 00:26:11.796]  And really those are rival drug gangs, aren't they?
[00:26:12.156 --> 00:26:12.697]  Exactly.
[00:26:12.837 --> 00:26:17.601]  And it's basically now, you know, with Blackwater has gotten the approval not to go into Mexico.
[00:26:18.781 --> 00:26:24.403]  Basically, they're going to say that they're going to be training the soldiers and training the paramilitary.
[00:26:24.923 --> 00:26:32.724]  But in fact, they're going to be used as assassin groups to go in and take out anybody that's against the military.
[00:26:32.925 --> 00:26:34.845]  And that's basically what's going on.
[00:26:34.865 --> 00:26:41.927]  $146 billion in one year to Mexico, that is about 20% of the Iraq war funding.
[00:26:42.307 --> 00:26:47.328]  I mean, I don't know if people ever realize, what do you think Mexico is going to do with the money Bush is going to give them?
[00:26:47.884 --> 00:26:54.233]  Well, they're not going to do anything because the enforcement on the drug war has never worked, and there's a history to show that.
[00:26:54.373 --> 00:26:57.658]  Well, no, they're going to use that money, aren't they, to go knock out their competition, right?
[00:26:57.798 --> 00:26:58.279]  Exactly.
[00:26:58.319 --> 00:27:02.585]  They're going to be buying the weapons and all kinds of explosives from the military.
[00:27:03.386 --> 00:27:08.189]  And, you know, the guys, the freelancers are the ones that are going to be making the money.
[00:27:08.629 --> 00:27:14.652]  And you've got to remember right now here in South Texas, we've got more banks than we do Circle K's or whatever.
[00:27:14.672 --> 00:27:23.617]  And, you know, the banking system is building, you know, economic-wise is terrible down here, but yet we've got a bank in every corner now.
[00:27:23.677 --> 00:27:31.325]  By the way, for the folks that don't know, that's because the drug dealers then put their money in a bank and then loan it out ten times what's in there in Fractional Reserve Banking.
[00:27:31.625 --> 00:27:39.233]  Here in Austin, there is literally, you'll go out in the middle of nowhere and there'll be fifteen banks just sitting there with no one visiting them.
[00:27:39.734 --> 00:27:41.455]  Just banks everywhere.
[00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:44.971]  Yeah, they're just storing money.
[00:27:45.191 --> 00:27:56.675]  And one of the biggest banks here in Texas, called Texas State Bank, has just been bought out by a Spanish bank that is tied to laundering operations by the CIA.
[00:27:56.695 --> 00:27:59.376]  So, there's a history to show that.
[00:27:59.436 --> 00:28:03.717]  And that's tied in with all those Austin officials, who all have their own private banks.
[00:28:03.837 --> 00:28:04.417]  Absolutely.
[00:28:06.278 --> 00:28:08.900]  It's tied in with, you know, it's been sold.
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:14.723]  And the bank out of Spain owns the bank, the Texas State Bank now.
[00:28:15.684 --> 00:28:17.245]  Man, it's incredible, Selly.
[00:28:17.405 --> 00:28:20.066]  It's like the corruption is just going wild right now.
[00:28:20.547 --> 00:28:24.029]  Well, there's no checks and balances of anybody here with this administration.
[00:28:24.049 --> 00:28:29.472]  They're basically doing whatever they want to do, and they think they can walk on water.
[00:28:29.812 --> 00:28:33.915]  And I certainly hope that if a new administration comes in that they'll put a stop to it.
[00:28:34.975 --> 00:28:38.781]  You know, we have more drugs today, Alex, than we did five years ago.
[00:28:38.921 --> 00:28:50.159]  So, that's to tell you that there's no such animals as the war on drugs, and it's just a big monopoly on cornering the market on drugs and money.
[00:28:54.002 --> 00:28:55.723]  Shelley, where's it going to end?
[00:28:55.783 --> 00:28:57.824]  I mean, I guess they'll just kill whoever they want.
[00:28:57.924 --> 00:29:02.746]  I guess we'll be... I mean, they're already killing reporters and bombing and then the media keeps it quiet.
[00:29:02.806 --> 00:29:05.187]  I guess we're just all going to be third world slaves?
[00:29:05.227 --> 00:29:05.807]  What's going to happen?
[00:29:06.212 --> 00:29:08.513]  Well, basically that's what's going to happen, Alex.
[00:29:08.713 --> 00:29:12.194]  You know, as we know, one out of ten Americans is incarcerated now.
[00:29:12.854 --> 00:29:17.756]  And that's going to shoot down to one out of five.
[00:29:18.356 --> 00:29:22.358]  And, you know, they're building more prisons than there are schools and so forth.
[00:29:22.378 --> 00:29:26.159]  And we have more drugs today in the elementary level than we ever have before.
[00:29:26.179 --> 00:29:27.500]  Have you heard the latest?
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:28.020]  You're going to get...
[00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:30.761]  Ten years in prison for speeding now.
[00:29:31.421 --> 00:29:31.861]  Stay there.
[00:29:32.361 --> 00:29:33.622]  We'll be right back with Celica Stillo.
[00:29:33.702 --> 00:29:36.483]  Drug dealing government, imprisoning all the good people.
[00:29:36.803 --> 00:29:38.743]  With mindless idiot cops serving them.
[00:29:44.205 --> 00:29:45.145]  We're on the march.
[00:29:45.606 --> 00:29:47.206]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:48.126 --> 00:29:50.587]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:50.847 --> 00:29:52.608]  Alright, Mr. Nordstrom's is all set.
[00:29:55.109 --> 00:29:58.391]  We have more drugs today in the elementary level than we ever have before.
[00:29:58.871 --> 00:29:59.731]  Have you heard the latest?
[00:29:59.772 --> 00:30:03.013]  You're going to get 10 years in prison for speeding now.
[00:30:03.674 --> 00:30:04.074]  Stay there.
[00:30:04.094 --> 00:30:05.895]  We'll be right back with Celica Stillo.
[00:30:05.955 --> 00:30:08.736]  Drug dealing government imprisoning all the good people.
[00:30:09.056 --> 00:30:11.017]  With mindless idiot cops serving them.
[00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:17.341]  We're on the march.
[00:30:17.781 --> 00:30:19.402]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:20.302 --> 00:30:23.004]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:26.181 --> 00:30:28.282]  Hi, this is Dave from Ready Reserve Foods.
[00:30:28.702 --> 00:30:35.424]  I've been waiting patiently for the government and mainstream media to inform you of what is turning out to be the biggest problem facing the world in the last 50 years.
[00:30:36.064 --> 00:30:41.326]  For the last three years, the Earth has consumed more food than it has been able to produce, and it has now finally caught up with this.
[00:30:41.666 --> 00:30:47.808]  In the U.S., commodities such as flour and rice are already being rationed, and the next rice crop won't be available for another four to five months.
[00:30:48.588 --> 00:30:55.210]  It's fall in the Southern Hemisphere, and many countries are short the food necessary to make it through the winter and have stopped exporting certain commodities altogether.
[00:30:55.999 --> 00:30:57.140]  Remember our trade deficit?
[00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:02.784]  Trillions of dollars have stacked up outside the country and are now rushing in to buy our food production at any price.
[00:31:03.445 --> 00:31:09.269]  By late summer, if not early fall, it is likely our government will step in and control food and food exports under martial law.
[00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:11.291]  Call Ready Reserve Foods at 1-800-453-2202.
[00:31:11.311 --> 00:31:11.371]  1-800-453-2202.

[00:31:23.777 --> 00:31:34.461]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.

[00:31:47.848 --> 00:31:51.130]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:53.492]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[00:32:25.899 --> 00:32:29.400]  Hello, I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 15 books on health and natural healing.
[00:32:29.721 --> 00:32:33.442]  Vaccines included, medicines kill more people every year than any illness.
[00:32:33.842 --> 00:32:40.245]  The cost of drug side effects in America is more than $200 billion annually, with a worse toll taken by antibiotics.
[00:32:40.665 --> 00:32:43.546]  But there is a cure for this medical madness that has remained secret.
[00:32:43.946 --> 00:32:53.112]  OxySilver, developed by NASA scientists to keep astronauts healthy, is an evolutionary new dietary supplement making deadly vaccinations and antibiotics obsolete.
[00:32:53.352 --> 00:32:57.655]  Taking one to two teaspoons daily boosts natural immunity without drug toxicity.
[00:32:57.995 --> 00:33:00.817]  OxySilver combines oxygen and silver in a new way.
[00:33:01.118 --> 00:33:07.262]  The oxygen becomes a supercharged germ killer, freeing your immune system to fight colds, flus, cancers and more.
[00:33:07.582 --> 00:33:13.586]  Build disease defenses naturally, painlessly, powerfully, safely and inexpensively with OxySilver.
[00:33:13.906 --> 00:33:17.950]  You may still have time, we might still get by.
[00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:21.573]  Every time I think about it, I wanna cry.
[00:33:21.633 --> 00:33:29.800]  With bombs in the dirt, and the kids keep coming, don't we need these in time to be young?
[00:33:46.913 --> 00:33:51.137]  Let's go.
[00:34:12.543 --> 00:34:14.045]  Oh, that woman's got a beautiful voice.
[00:34:14.125 --> 00:34:15.967]  Her words are even more beautiful.
[00:34:16.088 --> 00:34:25.880]  Let's go ahead and go to Stella Costello.
[00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:26.961]  In closing, Stella.
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:29.960]  Give people your website.
[00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:33.042]  I know you said you wanted to thank the listeners for the support they gave you.
[00:34:34.002 --> 00:34:37.904]  And give us a brief update on where your court case is going with them setting you up.
[00:34:38.564 --> 00:34:39.444]  Okay.
[00:34:39.484 --> 00:34:45.586]  Yeah, I just got, I was selected for jury selection for the 9th of June.
[00:34:46.267 --> 00:34:54.390]  But we've asked for some files from Duran Contra and we got a continuance, or we're asking for a continuance instead of the 9th.
[00:34:55.445 --> 00:35:16.479]  And basically go to powderburns.org if you guys still want to buy my books or donate money because I know times are hard and I have received some funds and a lot of prayers from a lot of people and I do certainly understand that times are very hard especially with the gas today and so forth but if you find that little extra change I certainly would appreciate it.
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:24.445]  I paid the attorney the retainer that he was asking for and now I need to continue to pay him with
[00:35:25.565 --> 00:35:27.327]  And this lawyer comes highly recommended?
[00:35:27.988 --> 00:35:29.069]  Very highly recommended.
[00:35:29.129 --> 00:35:38.579]  He's an attorney out of San Antonio, Texas who has over 30 years of working with the federal
[00:35:43.074 --> 00:35:51.059]  Well, you have an incredible service record in the military, the police, and for the feds.
[00:35:52.921 --> 00:35:57.004]  So I really hope that you're successful in defeating them on this petty gun charge.
[00:35:57.564 --> 00:36:02.968]  And it also makes me sick how they spend millions of dollars on these charges on people, while all the real criminals run loose.
[00:36:03.648 --> 00:36:05.550]  But anything else you want to add, Celica Stillo?
[00:36:08.932 --> 00:36:11.413]  And when the book is sold out, that's it.
[00:36:11.433 --> 00:36:12.054]  How many got left?
[00:36:12.074 --> 00:36:12.914]  A couple hundred?
[00:36:34.664 --> 00:36:35.625]  That's exactly what I've got.
[00:36:35.645 --> 00:36:44.748]  I've got a couple hundred left, and I need the funds, so if you buy them, you'll get the last of the copies.
[00:36:44.988 --> 00:36:47.169]  It's an excellent book, and aren't all those signed too?
[00:36:47.969 --> 00:36:50.070]  Yes, they're all autographed personally by me.
[00:36:51.091 --> 00:36:52.331]  Well, fantastic.
[00:36:52.371 --> 00:36:53.352]  Give them the website again.
[00:36:54.072 --> 00:36:54.992]  It's powderburns.org.
[00:37:00.746 --> 00:37:14.017]  You know, it's always shocking to me, Shelly, that we know the government brings in the drugs, they're always getting caught, a plane just crashed with four tons, CIA rendition aircraft, there's a blackout in our news about it, but it's all over the foreign press and admitted.
[00:37:14.777 --> 00:37:19.420]  And the cops will still pull you over, have a checkpoint, and want to search people's cars for drugs.
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:27.504]  When you were a cop, did the cops know that the government shipped it in, or was it not until you were in the DEA in the 80s and saw it at El Apongo?
[00:37:27.544 --> 00:37:30.846]  I mean, had you heard stories before, or what?
[00:37:31.386 --> 00:37:31.847]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:37:31.947 --> 00:37:39.151]  It's just like, for example, when I got pulled over by, with ATF and DPS, that trooper went ballistic, because when he saw my book,
[00:37:39.771 --> 00:37:58.255]  He says, you're a conspiracy theorist, and he's shaking the book at my face, and, you know, saying, this is what you talk about the government, that, you know, the government that you belong to, and so forth, and he was just going off, you know, and it's basically, that's what it is, is that people are being trained... What did you say to this bedwetting punk?
[00:37:59.135 --> 00:38:06.057]  You know, I said to him, basically, in, you know, very simple words, he says, what have you ever done for your government?
[00:38:06.667 --> 00:38:12.831]  I mean, when was the last time you exercised your constitutional right, whether it was a protest or something?
[00:38:12.911 --> 00:38:14.892]  Oh no, the police act like protest are evil.
[00:38:14.952 --> 00:38:21.456]  I saw a protest out of Orlando against a Scientologist, and I want to get them on regardless of which side of the fence you're on on that.
[00:38:24.818 --> 00:38:36.691]  Yeah, I'm getting ready to get, believe it or not, I'm trying to get a whole bunch of veterans to go and protest.
[00:38:37.312 --> 00:38:43.179]  I started a new organization now, it's called Support Veterans with PTSD, Don't Prosecute Them.
[00:38:43.699 --> 00:38:46.801]  And I'm trying to get numbers of how many veterans have been arrested.
[00:38:46.821 --> 00:38:50.203]  They'll probably arrest you, saying you're not allowed, veterans aren't allowed to walk down the street.
[00:38:50.303 --> 00:38:50.823]  Exactly.
[00:38:50.903 --> 00:38:51.503]  Imagine that.
[00:38:51.664 --> 00:38:58.167]  We've come to this point in this country where our veterans who fought for their constitutional rights are not allowed to protest.
[00:38:58.287 --> 00:39:06.452]  Well, don't forget they shot a bunch of them with machine guns for peaceably protesting, you know, for their bonus checks decades after World War I.
[00:39:06.972 --> 00:39:08.073]  Exactly, I remember that.
[00:39:08.293 --> 00:39:09.875]  Yeah, it's not the first time they like to kill.
[00:39:09.895 --> 00:39:10.816]  I love to kill the veterans.
[00:39:11.196 --> 00:39:16.140]  Yeah, they'll probably say that's what you fight for in the military, so cops can tell you you have no right to walk down the street.
[00:39:17.121 --> 00:39:24.468]  Silly, but I mean, to the average cop out there that doesn't know, I know all the detectives know because most of them are involved in it, and they're in vice.
[00:39:25.409 --> 00:39:31.014]  Explain to them, what percentage of the drugs are laundered or shipped indirectly by the government?
[00:39:31.654 --> 00:39:34.577]  Well, very close to almost 100% of it.
[00:39:34.817 --> 00:39:38.500]  We go back, we started that crack epidemic, do you remember that Alex?
[00:39:39.461 --> 00:39:41.142]  That's now declassified, I know!
[00:39:41.503 --> 00:39:47.228]  Yeah, exactly, and there's been a couple of bipartisan investigations, congressional investigations.
[00:39:48.008 --> 00:39:52.050]  That has acknowledged that our government were complicit in drug traffic.
[00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:58.854]  So do you think that state police guy, as he was flipping out on you on the stage, staying for, you know, selling a gun illegally or whatever without a permit?
[00:39:58.994 --> 00:40:05.437]  I think what he was trying to do was trying to get a job with ATF or something, because he was really kissing up to their butt.
[00:40:05.617 --> 00:40:10.139]  And I'm telling you, you know, I'm very unprofessional.
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:24.026]  This six-foot stack of horse dung was yelling at a true veteran, a Vietnam vet, a police officer, a DEA guy who went on all these raids and trained all these people and got shot at and the rest of it.
[00:40:24.266 --> 00:40:30.729]  He's sitting there screaming at you, saying you're a conspiracy theorist, violating your First Amendment, flipping out over your book.
[00:40:31.209 --> 00:40:31.990]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:40:34.172 --> 00:40:42.999]  We have a guy who's a non-veteran who actually conspired against me, has not been arrested at all.
[00:40:43.719 --> 00:40:44.700]  Not even indicted.
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.541]  And this guy's not even a veteran.
[00:40:47.002 --> 00:40:51.706]  Describe exactly what this DPS guy looked like, what he was doing, and what you said to him.
[00:40:52.026 --> 00:40:56.189]  He was about six foot tall and kind of heavy built.
[00:40:57.775 --> 00:41:02.579]  His partner was Anglo, a very professional individual.
[00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:06.603]  But that Latino guy, and they're the worst.
[00:41:06.683 --> 00:41:19.714]  They tend to destroy their own people and just went off in front of everybody, trying to make an impression on them that I was a conspiracy theorist because of the book that I've written and so forth.
[00:41:20.014 --> 00:41:21.255]  I've never read the book.
[00:41:22.056 --> 00:41:24.478]  You've testified to the Congress about this.
[00:41:24.778 --> 00:41:25.478]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:41:25.498 --> 00:41:30.121]  And he has no idea or who I am.
[00:41:30.621 --> 00:41:36.545]  All he knew was that he was getting ready to arrest a former 20-year law enforcement officer.
[00:41:37.125 --> 00:41:40.107]  And that, to him, was going to be a big trophy for his name.
[00:41:42.068 --> 00:41:47.191]  So there we have guys, individuals like this, who are brainwashed, who would think that everybody's a criminal.
[00:41:49.695 --> 00:41:55.381]  I've done more time in the criminal justice enforcement type than he ever will be.
[00:41:55.401 --> 00:41:58.044]  Thank you Alex for having me and God bless everybody.
[00:42:06.572 --> 00:42:07.573]  It's Eric Nordstrom.
[00:42:07.913 --> 00:42:14.135]  Now, Jesse Elder was the original jazz musician in New York who had the idea of a money bomb.
[00:42:14.655 --> 00:42:19.557]  Then he gave the idea to Eric Nordstrom, I think it's important historically to know this, who carried the ball.
[00:42:19.597 --> 00:42:22.298]  Then Trevor Lyman, a marketing guy, came along later and picked it up.
[00:42:23.118 --> 00:42:24.158]  Well, here's Eric Nordstrom.
[00:42:24.519 --> 00:42:29.621]  He's the guy that first, you know, really made the initiation to set up the website, to do the Ron Paul Money Bombs.
[00:42:30.061 --> 00:42:31.101]  We promoted it here.
[00:42:31.621 --> 00:42:38.404]  The Ron Paul campaign told us on air, without me soliciting, that half the funds they got in the first half of their campaign was from this show.
[00:42:38.544 --> 00:42:38.804]  You.
[00:42:39.245 --> 00:42:39.485]  You.
[00:42:39.585 --> 00:42:40.665]  The listeners of this show.
[00:42:41.926 --> 00:42:42.266]  Wow!
[00:42:43.066 --> 00:42:44.687]  Ron Paul raised tens of millions of dollars.
[00:42:45.007 --> 00:42:48.548]  That money was well spent educating the public about the New World Order, the Federal Reserve.
[00:42:48.988 --> 00:42:49.969]  We know the Bilderberg Group.
[00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:57.456]  Uh, the Trilateral Commission meeting was very upset about the Ron Paul revolution that's ongoing, and I just want us to toot our own horn here.
[00:42:57.496 --> 00:43:01.760]  I want to toot your horn, Eric, and to show you how out of the loop I am.
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:05.644]  Last Wednesday I'm about to go on vacation, and they go, have you seen this Ron Paul money bomb?
[00:43:05.664 --> 00:43:06.865]  I mean, this Alex Jones money bomb.
[00:43:07.425 --> 00:43:08.126]  And I said, no.
[00:43:08.186 --> 00:43:08.767]  I said, what is it?
[00:43:08.787 --> 00:43:10.589]  And they said, well, it's the same guy that originally did it.
[00:43:12.074 --> 00:43:13.495]  And I said, man, I don't know.
[00:43:14.315 --> 00:43:18.357]  And I said, you know, I know we're thinking about doing this lease and starting this TV show and doing all this.
[00:43:18.878 --> 00:43:20.098]  This is the first time I've talked to him.
[00:43:20.138 --> 00:43:24.801]  I talked to him during the break just now, and this is the first time I'm talking to him, you know, today, live on air.
[00:43:25.341 --> 00:43:28.623]  So let me just ask him, A, why are you doing this money bomb?
[00:43:28.683 --> 00:43:30.744]  Why did you decide to do an Alex Jones money bomb?
[00:43:31.924 --> 00:43:32.865]  Eric, why are you doing this?
[00:43:35.647 --> 00:43:36.907]  Can we bring Eric Nordstrom up?
[00:43:37.647 --> 00:43:38.428]  What's that, Alex?
[00:43:38.528 --> 00:43:39.248]  I'm sorry, Eric.
[00:43:39.288 --> 00:43:43.209]  Can you tell people why you decided to do an Alex Jones Money Bomb?
[00:43:44.149 --> 00:43:49.750]  Well, essentially for the same reasons we wanted to do the Ron Paul Money Bombs, which is to educate the public.
[00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:51.670]  You know, Ron Paul's out there.
[00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:54.351]  He's trying to influence government and politics.
[00:43:55.731 --> 00:44:00.192]  But you, yourself, Alex, you know, there's all kinds of alternative media.
[00:44:00.452 --> 00:44:03.893]  We can only really turn to you guys to see what the heck's really going on.
[00:44:05.416 --> 00:44:14.127]  The mainstream media, we watch it, they cover various topics, and most of the time it's probably true, but they hide a lot of things, a lot of things they don't cover.
[00:44:14.948 --> 00:44:23.819]  Whereas organizations such as yours, you shine a light on everything, you leave nothing unturned, and I really do think that your organization there is kind of a lighthouse in the fog.
[00:44:24.782 --> 00:44:32.226]  And it's almost serving as a spear to pierce the thin veil of propaganda that we all receive day in and day out from the news.
[00:44:32.386 --> 00:44:52.056]  And I am somewhat of a blowhard, but the stuff I talk about is the truth, and in deep fog, you need a loud, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[00:44:52.517 --> 00:45:00.349]  He wrote a book called the money space bomb and the book was actually banned in England a while back I want to say about 10 years ago and
[00:45:01.081 --> 00:45:12.269]  And the book actually had something to do with the fact that, you know, governments who have central banks tend to inflate their money, and after a while their money system implodes, and that's why he called it the money bomb.
[00:45:12.389 --> 00:45:13.570]  Okay, so that's when the name came from.
[00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:13.930]  Go ahead.
[00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:15.091]  Well, it didn't actually come from that.
[00:45:15.111 --> 00:45:18.573]  I actually found that out after I'd gotten involved with Jesse Elder.
[00:45:18.613 --> 00:45:28.981]  Now, Jesse Elder, he had an opt-in email address where people could send him an email asking, you know, to donate $25 a week to Ron Paul's campaign.
[00:45:30.163 --> 00:45:35.005]  Soon after, a guy named James Sugra, he created a video called A Perfect Day.
[00:45:35.025 --> 00:45:36.286]  I saw that!
[00:45:36.606 --> 00:45:45.990]  Yeah, his concept was for everybody to donate something on one single perfect day to kind of blast some money to Ron Paul to enable his campaign.
[00:45:46.850 --> 00:45:54.993]  James Sugra actually contacted Jesse Elder to do up a money bomb for a day and Jesse Elder agreed.
[00:45:55.334 --> 00:45:58.535]  Soon after, Trevor Lyman also contacted James Sugra
[00:45:59.224 --> 00:46:04.267]  And that's when Trevor Lyman put up the ThisNovember5th.com website.
[00:46:04.407 --> 00:46:13.953]  Let me find out on air with you now, this has nothing to do, this is what you're doing, is Trevor Lyman involved in this?
[00:46:14.813 --> 00:46:15.413]  No, he's not.
[00:46:16.293 --> 00:46:20.855]  I've tried to get him involved in a lot of the stuff that I've been doing and I've never received an email from him.
[00:46:20.875 --> 00:46:21.555]  No, no, that's fine.
[00:46:21.575 --> 00:46:25.356]  I'd rather... He's fine and dandy, but he's doing his own... I'd love to have his support, you know.
[00:46:25.556 --> 00:46:25.756]  Yeah.
[00:46:26.036 --> 00:46:27.676]  Well, we gave him our support, but that doesn't matter.
[00:46:27.696 --> 00:46:28.596]  Let's just keep him separate.
[00:46:29.517 --> 00:46:32.938]  I mean, I know I've had none of these strategizing with you, so we'll just do it out in the open here on air.
[00:46:33.278 --> 00:46:34.018]  Yeah.
[00:46:35.149 --> 00:46:53.595]  I mean, I pledge, you probably need to put this on the side, and I appreciate what you're doing, I will spend 100% of the money on cameras, computers, a better office, and I'm just now moving anyways in the next month or two, and to produce
[00:46:55.276 --> 00:46:55.476]  We're good
[00:47:14.179 --> 00:47:15.279]  And I said, well, I'm going to do it.
[00:47:15.339 --> 00:47:18.820]  And I said, God, just show me a sign.
[00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:21.440]  And then the money bomb pops up.
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:23.421]  And I hadn't even talked about this really on air.
[00:47:23.801 --> 00:47:25.381]  And so I think it is something that needs to happen.
[00:47:25.601 --> 00:47:27.481]  What we'll do is we're going to have a PayPal account up there.
[00:47:27.561 --> 00:47:36.063]  And I'm going to have people here next on the 31st, two or three operators, at my office where you can call with a credit card number if you wish.
[00:47:36.543 --> 00:47:39.503]  Or you can mail checks that will get here by the 31st or there or around.
[00:47:39.523 --> 00:47:41.584]  And I will give 100%.
[00:47:43.905 --> 00:47:48.551]  100% into the organization to fund it.
[00:47:48.571 --> 00:47:48.551]  100%.
[00:47:49.272 --> 00:47:50.113]  None of it will go to me.
[00:47:50.173 --> 00:47:54.359]  It will all go to the infrastructure, to cameras, computers, and to developing.
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:56.101]  I want to start a
[00:47:57.888 --> 00:48:00.611]  First, a once-a-week, two-hour TV show.
[00:48:01.612 --> 00:48:07.798]  And I'd like to try to get that on Dish Network or something within three months of this happening, and that'll be breakneck hard to do in and of itself.
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:18.529]  Then, within a month of doing the weekend show, I would try to start a 30-minute everyday show, which takes a lot of work and fiber optic or satellite uplinks.
[00:48:20.091 --> 00:48:21.912]  The airtime isn't what's expensive.
[00:48:22.052 --> 00:48:23.013]  It's getting it set up.
[00:48:23.694 --> 00:48:26.376]  And then it can get really big on Dish Network or one of the others.
[00:48:27.216 --> 00:48:28.537]  If we get a lower channel, it's more.
[00:48:28.597 --> 00:48:29.498]  A higher channel, less.
[00:48:29.778 --> 00:48:31.940]  I think we have the buzz and the people to grow it.
[00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:40.467]  And then I would like to build that within a year into something like Democracy Now!, which has a whole network and is really becoming effective, but not liberal.
[00:48:40.987 --> 00:48:42.628]  We're talking libertarian patriotic.
[00:48:42.668 --> 00:48:43.089]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:48:45.031 --> 00:49:02.880]  Well, yeah, I mean, the whole thing is, you know, the only way to make a change is, a lot of people like to throw that word around, but the only way to make a permanent worldview change, and what I mean by that is, you know, a lot of people in the States, we kind of run our world based on a popular culture, a celebrity society.
[00:49:04.213 --> 00:49:11.384]  Well, let's go away and we've got to try to remember that the bad guys out there are trying to divide and conquer us.
[00:49:11.504 --> 00:49:12.786]  There is no us and them.
[00:49:12.806 --> 00:49:14.308]  It's just we.
[00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:16.892]  So we've got to basically support ourselves.
[00:49:16.932 --> 00:49:17.974]  We've got to get the word out.
[00:49:18.806 --> 00:49:24.489]  And if we're going to do that, we've got to get into the mainstream celebrity universe.
[00:49:24.689 --> 00:49:25.309]  Well, that's it.
[00:49:25.549 --> 00:49:27.990]  And we hear a lot of pipe dreams.
[00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:33.473]  We hear a lot of other people who claim they're going to raise all this money and buy all these stations or do this or that.
[00:49:33.833 --> 00:49:34.734]  I never talk big.
[00:49:34.774 --> 00:49:35.394]  I just do it.
[00:49:36.034 --> 00:49:45.599]  And so the thing is, I'm going, if I'm going to really upgrade my office, really do a TV show, really start another network, TV network, I mean, I'm going to really try it.
[00:49:45.679 --> 00:49:50.081]  I mean, I'm really going to go 18 hours a day and cough up blood if I have to.
[00:49:50.121 --> 00:49:53.403]  I mean, I'm going, I mean, I'm not going to start something and not do it.
[00:49:54.063 --> 00:50:02.147]  And I've never, but the problem was, is I don't like asking for the money, I don't like making the money to do it, but I've got to do it, and this money bomb comes at a perfect time.
[00:50:02.527 --> 00:50:04.148]  I mean, when did you finally decide to do this?
[00:50:05.922 --> 00:50:11.506]  Oh, I flipped it around in my head, kind of probably for the same reasons that you were last week.
[00:50:11.727 --> 00:50:13.768]  I mean, a money bomb's kind of a finicky thing.
[00:50:14.429 --> 00:50:16.730]  It can either bomb good or it can bomb bad.
[00:50:18.051 --> 00:50:22.915]  So whether to do it or not, you kind of have to gauge support, and you have to gauge, well, are these people ready to do it?
[00:50:23.175 --> 00:50:26.838]  Are they serious about supporting someone?
[00:50:26.858 --> 00:50:28.179]  Are they serious about getting the award out?
[00:50:28.199 --> 00:50:30.701]  Are they serious about fighting the bad guys?
[00:50:32.084 --> 00:50:38.189]  You know, that's why I kind of decided, well, yeah, I think that the people that listen to Alex Jones, well, most of them got a fair.
[00:50:38.529 --> 00:50:40.571]  And I think that they're ready to actually do something.
[00:50:40.931 --> 00:50:42.593]  Stay there, Eric Nordstrom.
[00:50:42.613 --> 00:50:44.054]  We'll come back in the final five minutes.
[00:50:44.074 --> 00:50:45.795]  Sorry, some of the callers, we're out of time.
[00:50:46.136 --> 00:50:47.477]  Five minutes, we'll talk more about the Money Bomb.
[00:50:47.777 --> 00:50:49.479]  Infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[00:50:49.759 --> 00:50:53.202]  Links to it up on infowars.com.
[00:50:54.363 --> 00:50:55.784]  It is a big idea.
[00:50:56.845 --> 00:50:57.846]  A new world order.
[00:50:58.584 --> 00:51:03.069]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:51:03.489 --> 00:51:06.352]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:51:06.372 --> 00:51:08.594]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:51:09.095 --> 00:51:11.537]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:51:12.278 --> 00:51:19.605]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:51:22.616 --> 00:51:27.580]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:31.722]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:51:31.922 --> 00:51:34.444]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:51:34.504 --> 00:51:35.465]  Most people have no idea.
[00:51:35.485 --> 00:51:36.425]  They're not after money.
[00:51:36.445 --> 00:51:37.546]  They have all the money they need.
[00:51:37.746 --> 00:51:38.507]  They're after power.
[00:51:38.707 --> 00:51:39.567]  That's what Africa needs here.
[00:51:39.868 --> 00:51:44.410]  Order in-game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[00:51:48.413 --> 00:51:48.713]  Endgame.
[00:51:48.753 --> 00:51:51.154]  Blueprint for global enslaving.
[00:51:51.394 --> 00:51:52.574]  You have been warned.
[00:51:53.275 --> 00:51:54.355]  Why should we fire Congress?
[00:51:54.555 --> 00:51:58.036]  Because they use the Constitution of the United States as a scrap of paper.
[00:51:58.176 --> 00:52:00.297]  They swear an oath to follow it, and then they reject it.
[00:52:00.497 --> 00:52:03.158]  That was their employment document.
[00:52:03.298 --> 00:52:04.038]  They haven't followed it.
[00:52:04.358 --> 00:52:06.119]  Congressmen, Senators, you're fired.
[00:52:06.239 --> 00:52:07.959]  Washington, you're fired!
[00:52:08.139 --> 00:52:09.680]  I think it's the next freedom to fascism.
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:16.646]  Washington You're Fired was born out of sheer frustration with abuses in our current political system, and it gives a voice to Americans across the country.
[00:52:17.066 --> 00:52:32.679]  Washington You're Fired examines constitutional issues as they relate to the Katrina disaster, the President's illegal spy program, NSA data mining, FISA's secret court, the illegal wiretapping of millions of Americans, and the last seven years of terror-related spy bills, how they affect you, and what you can do about it.
[00:52:33.119 --> 00:52:37.123]  Washington You're Fired captures the spirit and zest of an old-fashioned Boston Tea Party.
[00:52:37.483 --> 00:52:40.846]  Ken Williams describes the film as a rabble-rousing call to arms.
[00:52:41.346 --> 00:52:42.887]  We invite you to make the change with us.
[00:52:43.228 --> 00:52:44.488]  Help take back our government now.

[00:52:53.596 --> 00:52:57.858]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:52:58.098 --> 00:53:03.041]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:53:03.061 --> 00:53:04.642]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:53:04.702 --> 00:53:08.204]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[00:54:21.647 --> 00:54:31.575]  There's a lot of people that don't know what it's like to really work in this movement.
[00:54:32.696 --> 00:54:34.037]  Well, who's the workaholic?
[00:54:34.338 --> 00:54:35.539]  Who's the maniac?
[00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:40.022]  Who will actually take action and get it done?
[00:54:40.142 --> 00:54:40.523]  You!
[00:54:41.904 --> 00:54:42.925]  That's right, it's not me.
[00:54:44.662 --> 00:54:46.888]  You're the ones that'll make it happen.
[00:54:47.290 --> 00:54:49.074]  You're the ones that'll turn it loose.
[00:54:50.837 --> 00:54:57.423]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to step it up a notch against the New World Order.
[00:54:58.323 --> 00:55:00.685]  Go to InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com and pledge.
[00:55:01.326 --> 00:55:06.830]  We're going to have a 1-800 number up there for you by next week to call the Money Bomb Day and a PayPal.
[00:55:07.731 --> 00:55:12.135]  And if it's successful, we'll launch it in 3-4 months when we start a TV show.
[00:55:12.695 --> 00:55:15.718]  We'll have another bombing the bomb to go to the next level and start the network.
[00:55:18.635 --> 00:55:20.983]  And hell, we'll even publish the financials on it.
[00:55:22.809 --> 00:55:24.575]  And you know me, I don't talk, I do it!
[00:55:25.652 --> 00:55:29.314]  Because, and it's a lot of work folks, a lot of stuff we're facing to do this.
[00:55:29.374 --> 00:55:31.635]  And people say, oh it won't work, you won't beat the new world order with that.
[00:55:31.935 --> 00:55:32.375]  So what?
[00:55:32.415 --> 00:55:33.175]  We're taking action.
[00:55:34.236 --> 00:55:36.657]  I'm not here to talk, I'm here to take action.
[00:55:37.257 --> 00:55:42.500]  Going to Eric Nordstrom, really the critical guy that got the money bomb going, and then Lyman and others picked it up.
[00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:45.461]  Well I'm glad you're doing this and I apologize I haven't called you until now.
[00:55:45.501 --> 00:55:49.423]  I was kind of apprehensive and was just going to try to get more sponsors and raise more money.
[00:55:50.463 --> 00:55:54.224]  And however much it makes, and what is there, like close to $30,000 has been pledged.
[00:55:54.625 --> 00:56:02.487]  And in your experience, because I haven't really talked to you guys, but doesn't usually more money get given than what is pledged, or what happens?
[00:56:03.988 --> 00:56:05.668]  It goes up and down, it's hard to tell.
[00:56:06.469 --> 00:56:19.453]  But yeah, quite often you'll have certain pledges, or a certain amount of pledges, and then whatever has been pledged, usually on the day of the actual donations, more money winds up being poured in than what was advertised.
[00:56:21.115 --> 00:56:24.538]  Okay, well, I better get off my hind end.
[00:56:24.558 --> 00:56:29.182]  I mean, off my hind end, I've been working until midnight every night for the last few months, but I'm going to get a phone number.
[00:56:29.202 --> 00:56:31.423]  I've got a bunch of phone numbers, but we'll get an easy number to call here.
[00:56:31.884 --> 00:56:36.988]  I've got to get some extra people in this little hovel to try to answer the phone that day in case they shut down our PayPal.
[00:56:37.008 --> 00:56:39.590]  They play all kinds of games, so they can't stop us.
[00:56:40.110 --> 00:56:45.995]  They've done that to a lot of other people, and we'll do it, and we'll try to confer with you, and I'm just going to go with my main PayPal.
[00:56:46.055 --> 00:56:49.778]  We'll post that whenever you want, and then we'll
[00:56:50.899 --> 00:56:54.623]  The problem is setting up a new one, then they have a limited amount of how much can be given to a new one.
[00:56:54.643 --> 00:56:55.924]  There's a lot of weird problems in this.
[00:56:56.625 --> 00:56:58.527]  But we'll figure it all out in the next few days.
[00:56:59.107 --> 00:56:59.327]  Alex?
[00:56:59.568 --> 00:57:00.228]  Yes, sir?
[00:57:00.248 --> 00:57:01.149]  Do I have a couple seconds?
[00:57:01.229 --> 00:57:03.812]  I just wanted to say something to the folks that are listening out there.
[00:57:03.932 --> 00:57:04.352]  Yeah, go ahead.
[00:57:04.773 --> 00:57:05.934]  This is an info war.
[00:57:07.696 --> 00:57:12.420]  Yeah, it's the name of a show, but it's also actually and truly an information war.
[00:57:13.886 --> 00:57:17.887]  And, uh, if you dive into a little of Sun Tzu, there's three primary powers.
[00:57:18.067 --> 00:57:20.548]  There's knowledge, there's wealth, and then there's force.
[00:57:20.948 --> 00:57:23.849]  You could always symbolize them as the sword, the treasure, and the scroll.
[00:57:24.789 --> 00:57:26.630]  Interestingly, our government's set up that way.
[00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:34.172]  The executive branch is the sword or the force, uh, congress is the treasure or the wealth, and the judicial branch is the scroll or the knowledge.
[00:57:35.353 --> 00:57:39.234]  Basically, any one of these three forces can be used to obtain the other two.
[00:57:40.134 --> 00:57:44.038]  Once you have all three, of course, then you're God, you're King.
[00:57:45.419 --> 00:57:50.684]  But the key is, if you have a servant such as our government, you have to balance those powers.
[00:57:50.704 --> 00:57:51.065]  You know what?
[00:57:51.085 --> 00:57:51.925]  I've been running over you.
[00:57:51.945 --> 00:57:52.926]  We're going into overdrive.
[00:57:53.847 --> 00:57:54.808]  Overdrive, baby!
[00:57:54.848 --> 00:57:55.649]  Stay there, okay?
[00:57:56.850 --> 00:57:59.333]  Eric, we're going to call you back on my local studio line, okay?
[00:57:59.713 --> 00:58:00.474]  You got his number, right?
[00:58:01.658 --> 00:58:02.379]  Yes.
[00:58:02.739 --> 00:58:04.841]  I am it to my guy for me, John.
[00:58:04.881 --> 00:58:05.241]  Thank you.
[00:58:05.681 --> 00:58:06.782]  We're going to call you back, Eric.
[00:58:06.802 --> 00:58:10.345]  We're going to do 10 minutes on the other side in InfoWars Overdrive.
[00:58:10.365 --> 00:58:20.153]  I want to say bye to all the MNFM affiliates, everybody else, but for Internet listeners and PrisonPlanet.TV viewers, we're going to come back into Overdrive with Eric Nordstrom with InfoWarsMoneybomb.com.
[00:58:20.353 --> 00:58:22.174]  Everybody else, I'll see you this Sunday.
[00:58:22.234 --> 00:58:25.357]  Big show, 4 to 6 p.m., and at the Automobile Drafthouse, South Lamar.
[00:58:25.857 --> 00:58:29.206]  Go to InfoWars.com right now to hear the internet feed.
[00:58:29.346 --> 00:58:33.055]  Everybody, if you want to hear the rest of this, I am impressed with Eric Nordstrom.
[00:58:35.063 --> 00:58:35.623]  Thank you, John.
[00:58:36.123 --> 00:58:36.764]  Anytime, Jones.
[00:58:36.784 --> 00:58:37.404]  We'll see you Monday.
[00:58:37.424 --> 00:58:38.044]  See you, Bubba.
[00:58:38.224 --> 00:58:38.805]  Take care.
[00:58:38.845 --> 00:58:40.365]  Alright, we're going to shift gears now.
[00:58:40.545 --> 00:58:44.887]  We're going to go ahead and shift gears now with our intro music.
[00:58:44.967 --> 00:58:46.768]  Official money bomb music.
[00:58:46.788 --> 00:58:48.188]  A flight of the Valkyries.
[00:58:49.089 --> 00:58:55.811]  A flight of little money bombs flapping in with everything for everybody.
[00:58:56.252 --> 00:58:56.472]  Wait.
[00:58:57.392 --> 00:58:58.813]  Here come the Info Warriors.
[00:58:59.253 --> 00:59:01.113]  They gave millions to Ron Paul.
[00:59:01.734 --> 00:59:04.455]  Will they fill our treasury with Info Weapons?
[00:59:06.184 --> 00:59:09.005]  Ah.
[00:59:09.425 --> 00:59:14.167]  I need to stop acting stupid.
[00:59:14.447 --> 00:59:20.729]  I like to joke around a little bit.
[00:59:20.989 --> 00:59:23.210]  Oh God.
[00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:28.292]  What an insane world.
[00:59:30.145 --> 00:59:30.665]  Do we have him?
[00:59:31.505 --> 00:59:32.286]  Oh, we're getting him right now.
[00:59:33.246 --> 00:59:36.147]  Eric Nordstrom on our local line.
[00:59:36.167 --> 00:59:40.469]  Man, he was saying some eloquent stuff while I'm running over him as usual.
[00:59:40.909 --> 00:59:43.090]  This interruption brought to you by Infowars.com.
[00:59:45.551 --> 00:59:46.311]  Oh my goodness.
[00:59:48.111 --> 00:59:54.614]  You know, I've got a Dutch newspaper claiming that Bush is going to meet
[00:59:57.463 --> 01:00:04.373]  With the Dutch President and that Bilderberg is going to be meeting in Chantilly, Virginia, outside DC.
[01:00:06.076 --> 01:00:07.798]  And that it's still on, that it's June 5th.
[01:00:11.633 --> 01:00:13.155]  But is this an old newspaper?
[01:00:13.635 --> 01:00:14.456]  I was just given this.
[01:00:14.556 --> 01:00:20.042]  It says it's new, but it is a major publication, but I'm going to try to track that down.
[01:00:20.182 --> 01:00:21.924]  Tucker got his time zones wrong yesterday.
[01:00:21.944 --> 01:00:26.068]  All right, we're talking in overdrive right now to Eric Nordstrom.
[01:00:26.088 --> 01:00:27.490]  Eric, I want to commend you for the money bomb.
[01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:29.251]  I'm sorry I was timid at first.
[01:00:29.312 --> 01:00:30.993]  I just never really asked for donations.
[01:00:31.514 --> 01:00:32.355]  But why shouldn't I?
[01:00:32.435 --> 01:00:33.055]  See, it's weird.
[01:00:33.096 --> 01:00:34.417]  The good guys won't do it.
[01:00:34.757 --> 01:00:35.037]  Go ahead.
[01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:07.273]  Well, first of all, before I get into that, though, I just want to say, you don't have to ask for anything.
[01:01:07.333 --> 01:01:08.174]  We've got your back.
[01:01:08.414 --> 01:01:13.459]  You know, a lot of folks out there probably listen to the show for entertainment value.
[01:01:13.519 --> 01:01:16.021]  A lot of the folks probably take everything very seriously.
[01:01:17.342 --> 01:01:20.465]  But then again, a lot of the folks probably don't know what to think, you know.
[01:01:20.905 --> 01:01:26.630]  But at least, at the very least, what I think your role is, is you get people thinking.
[01:01:26.690 --> 01:01:30.654]  You get people to actually, how you say it, question their reality.
[01:01:31.405 --> 01:01:32.466]  What's really going on?
[01:01:32.726 --> 01:01:35.348]  They may not agree with you, but that doesn't matter.
[01:01:35.789 --> 01:01:44.176]  If you can flip one switch, and turn on that light bulb, that's all it takes for everything else to cascade, and for reality to set in.
[01:01:44.456 --> 01:01:47.579]  So, you know, we've got your back, and we're going to get this thing going.
[01:01:48.459 --> 01:01:54.825]  And if there's an information bomb, and what I was saying about the information bomb, or the information war, is there is war.
[01:01:55.638 --> 01:02:00.501]  The basic premise of tactics and strategy is you have to utilize three primary powers.
[01:02:01.081 --> 01:02:03.022]  They are knowledge, wealth, and force.
[01:02:03.522 --> 01:02:07.904]  They could also be, well, I guess symbolized as the sword, the treasure, and the scroll.
[01:02:09.445 --> 01:02:14.808]  Our government's set up that way, whether it was intended or not, I don't know, but the executive branch is the sword or the force.
[01:02:15.408 --> 01:02:17.009]  Congress is the treasure or the wealth.
[01:02:17.850 --> 01:02:20.311]  The judicial branch is the scroll or knowledge.
[01:02:21.151 --> 01:02:21.912]  And it's always been
[01:02:23.516 --> 01:02:36.407]  The attempt to balance these powers for fair-minded individuals, but also to obtain and increase these powers for people who aren't necessarily fair-minded, who want to gain additional power without unregulated control.
[01:02:37.508 --> 01:02:44.214]  But for us in the information war, you are a treasure trove of knowledge, which is one of the powers.
[01:02:45.313 --> 01:02:53.395]  Now, to obtain any kind of force or change, to be able to change people's perspectives and get people thinking again, you're gonna need the treasure.
[01:02:54.716 --> 01:03:06.639]  And this all goes back to Sun Tzu, The Art of War, all through all kinds of military strategies, it's always been known that these three things have to be harnessed in order to influence the change that we're looking for in our society.
[01:03:06.679 --> 01:03:12.621]  To change politics, to change government, we, the people, must do so by influencing
[01:03:13.453 --> 01:03:18.358]  By influencing I mean by utilizing our knowledge, our wealth, and our force.
[01:03:18.678 --> 01:03:20.039]  By force I don't mean violence.
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:21.261]  Violence is horrid.
[01:03:22.081 --> 01:03:28.808]  You have to defend yourself sometimes, you may need to employ it, but force just simply means the actions.
[01:03:29.288 --> 01:03:32.612]  You're going out, you're talking to people, you're going out and you're making a difference.
[01:03:34.349 --> 01:03:37.392]  You know, government is supposed to be the servant, and we are the masters.
[01:03:37.412 --> 01:03:47.781]  You know, we have to remember that, and a lot of the time we don't remember, we don't realize, and what I mean by realize is to make real, that we are the government.
[01:03:48.042 --> 01:03:49.043]  We are the people.
[01:03:49.223 --> 01:03:57.070]  The government is our servant, the government is a tool to harness the power of governance, to harness the powers of wealth,
[01:03:57.992 --> 01:03:58.933]  Well, I was pretty impressed.
[01:03:58.973 --> 01:03:59.953]  It was very dramatic.
[01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:30.472]  The guy who put it together, he did a fantastic job of it.
[01:04:30.732 --> 01:04:32.914]  And it really kind of got me emotionally charged.
[01:04:33.594 --> 01:04:36.917]  And at first I was thinking, wow, you know, this can't be so.
[01:04:37.337 --> 01:04:37.657]  No way.
[01:04:37.837 --> 01:04:39.198]  I grew up in Dallas as well.
[01:04:39.679 --> 01:04:42.320]  Carrollton Copper, Arlington, 14 years in Dallas.
[01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:48.725]  And so when you had said that, I was like, oh dear, you know, is my IQ dropped by 20 points?
[01:04:48.825 --> 01:04:50.406]  And so I checked it out.
[01:04:50.566 --> 01:04:53.769]  I went to a number of different references myself and
[01:04:54.816 --> 01:04:56.097]  Sure enough, there it was.
[01:04:56.558 --> 01:04:59.140]  Wednesday, Alex Jones is saying the truth.
[01:05:01.061 --> 01:05:03.263]  References out there, not by Alex Jones.
[01:05:03.323 --> 01:05:04.824]  Other references are government documents.
[01:05:05.404 --> 01:05:08.567]  Yeah, I mean, on average, some studies say 10 points, 15 points, 20, 25, 30.
[01:05:09.488 --> 01:05:14.511]  There's all these government studies, but the average is about 20 points if you drink it when you're a child.
[01:05:14.531 --> 01:05:17.314]  If you start drinking later, it doesn't hurt you that bad.
[01:05:18.995 --> 01:05:21.557]  My point is, though, is what do you agree with Alex Jones?
[01:05:21.577 --> 01:05:22.818]  What do you agree with Ron Paul?
[01:05:23.399 --> 01:05:32.827]  Whether you agree with the guys at Restore the Republic, the Freedom Movement, the Truth Movement, the 9-1-1 Movement, whether you agree with the guys on CNN, with Fox, it doesn't matter.
[01:05:33.247 --> 01:05:34.608]  We all live on this rock.
[01:05:35.529 --> 01:05:39.152]  The bottom line is, is whatever they say, don't take it at face value.
[01:05:39.532 --> 01:05:40.774]  Go do your own research.
[01:05:40.834 --> 01:05:42.095]  This is a time to wake up.
[01:05:42.595 --> 01:05:43.796]  This is a time to be you.
[01:05:45.542 --> 01:05:46.222]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:05:46.262 --> 01:05:46.462]  Continue.
[01:06:16.261 --> 01:06:19.744]  And so that's basically been my premise for doing the Money Bomb.
[01:06:19.764 --> 01:06:29.571]  If people can donate and get the money in, you've got to put the business end aside and understand that this is a free market economy.
[01:06:29.651 --> 01:06:39.999]  If we're going to use the free market economy to our benefit, which is supposed to be per the Constitution and how we do things in this world, if we're going to use what the bad guys use,
[01:06:40.805 --> 01:06:43.006]  Well, we need to use it for a good intent, which is to get the word out.
[01:06:43.026 --> 01:06:43.566]  Well, exactly.
[01:06:44.066 --> 01:06:49.588]  How does Pastor Hagee, the neocon that says, kill all the Arabs, nuke the planet, how does he get his power?
[01:06:49.648 --> 01:06:55.410]  He went and begged for money, and did go put a TV network on, and did produce shows, and then it got bigger and bigger.
[01:06:55.730 --> 01:06:58.731]  So we have to counter that same system.
[01:06:58.832 --> 01:07:04.474]  And frankly, I'm not in the business of bashing other Patriot talk shows and other little dinky networks and things.
[01:07:05.874 --> 01:07:12.459]  Out of this whole pantheon, I am the biggest thing in this movement as for alternative radio and things.
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:15.221]  And I'm also somebody that doesn't beg for money in the past.
[01:07:15.261 --> 01:07:17.964]  I'm somebody who isn't really into the whole money end of things.
[01:07:18.004 --> 01:07:19.565]  The money I've got is almost an annoyance.
[01:07:19.965 --> 01:07:23.448]  The few possessions I've got always are annoying me, having to mess with them, deal with them.
[01:07:23.788 --> 01:07:24.669]  I'm into ideas.
[01:07:25.289 --> 01:07:40.177]  And I'm one of the few people, other patriots have told me, that actually pays my bills, that actually pays my employees, doesn't try to cheat them, that gives people bonuses, that actually works, that doesn't care, that can sign a bandwidth agreement for $15,000 a month, so I can have super good CDNs.
[01:07:40.677 --> 01:07:42.158]  I'm somebody who really will do it.
[01:07:42.639 --> 01:07:50.843]  Most of these other people that have claimed they're going to start networks, they can't do it, because money comes in, and then they go, hmm, this has happened, oh, I've got to use this for me.
[01:07:51.223 --> 01:07:52.404]  I could buy a Corvette.
[01:07:52.904 --> 01:07:55.586]  Now, that's not going to happen here.
[01:07:55.606 --> 01:07:57.667]  100% of the Moneybomb Money will go.
[01:07:57.747 --> 01:07:58.508]  And I've already committed.
[01:07:58.528 --> 01:08:09.975]  I'm already going to go bare minimum for the once a week, two hour or so, nicely produced, taped cable show with guests we fly in and the rest of it.
[01:08:09.995 --> 01:08:13.157]  And I'm even going to try to hook up little studios to kind of give it a modern look.
[01:08:13.837 --> 01:08:17.118]  Uh, where people have their own little studios, kind of like YouTube, but fiber optic in.
[01:08:17.138 --> 01:08:18.578]  We don't even need satellite uplinks now.
[01:08:18.978 --> 01:08:25.780]  I mean, I could have a whole lineup, or like a morning news show, a midday live show, another show, and other people that want their films aired.
[01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:27.060]  That's how Free Speech TV works.
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:31.381]  They just, you know, they just have an authorization for you to play it, then you plug how to buy it at the end.
[01:08:31.421 --> 01:08:32.181]  That's their payment.
[01:08:32.541 --> 01:08:34.482]  I can get a lot of our Patriot films on there.
[01:08:34.782 --> 01:08:36.262]  I mean, I can program a network.
[01:08:36.802 --> 01:08:41.183]  I hear other people talk about it, and I wish they would do it, and then they never even contacted me about helping.
[01:08:41.604 --> 01:08:42.744]  Why would they not want talent?
[01:08:43.624 --> 01:08:45.405]  Yeah, I do have something that triggered me.
[01:08:45.445 --> 01:08:49.306]  You were talking to a fella out here in England
[01:09:10.948 --> 01:09:17.715]  Who basically got booted from his show, because I guess he had said to go ahead and vote for someone.
[01:09:17.735 --> 01:09:20.097]  Yeah, James Weyl, James Weyl.
[01:09:20.317 --> 01:09:31.128]  Yeah, and what triggered the idea for me to connect it with the Money Bomb was something he said actually at the end of the show, which was he jokingly said, well maybe I'll start a PrisonPlanet.co.uk.
[01:09:33.467 --> 01:09:36.629]  And I thought, wow, you know, what if this was to franchise out?
[01:09:36.930 --> 01:09:43.474]  No, but see, he's calling me now, wanting to do that, and I don't have the personnel to even help him or do it, but go ahead.
[01:09:43.735 --> 01:09:44.115]  Exactly.
[01:09:44.275 --> 01:09:45.896]  So that's what triggered the idea for me.
[01:09:45.956 --> 01:09:50.199]  I thought that, wow, if this thing could go global, this would be a force to be reckoned with.
[01:09:50.239 --> 01:09:51.760]  This is David versus Goliath.
[01:09:51.981 --> 01:09:58.425]  You know, there's Republic Magazine, there's Revolution Broadcasting, there's Freedom Force International, there's Truth News.
[01:09:58.746 --> 01:10:01.988]  You know, there are all kinds of budding organizations that are coming up.
[01:10:03.285 --> 01:10:12.569]  But they're meeting a great deal of resistance from these huge, massive, gigantic corporate monoliths.
[01:10:13.089 --> 01:10:15.850]  And the only way to get around that is us.
[01:10:18.331 --> 01:10:18.451]  Us.
[01:10:18.511 --> 01:10:19.191]  We need to fund it.
[01:10:19.211 --> 01:10:22.052]  We need to fund these tools of knowledge and of information.
[01:10:22.592 --> 01:10:23.573]  We need to get it out there.
[01:10:24.378 --> 01:10:33.624]  And the only way we can do it right now is face-to-face, one person at one person, it cascades out, being like around the campfire, you go talk to your neighbors.
[01:10:34.544 --> 01:10:48.673]  And the quicker way of doing it is utilizing something that's already in place, which is the Alex Jones Empire, to basically put it up in the sky and get a bigger audience and get people talking, get people thinking.
[01:10:49.421 --> 01:11:04.760]  Uh, whether you want to change politics, whether you want to change policy, whether you want to be free again, you know, whatever your perspective and point of view, if you want freedom in this country, if you want to retain sovereignty, if you want to reverse some of the actions that you feel our government's doing poorly,
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:06.841]  Well, you've got to trumpet it.
[01:11:07.021 --> 01:11:08.363]  You've got to go blast it.
[01:11:08.583 --> 01:11:14.089]  And the biggest and best way I can think of doing it right now is through the information war.
[01:11:14.429 --> 01:11:15.370]  Theinfowar.com.
[01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:16.551]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:11:16.851 --> 01:11:20.695]  And I can't think of a better place or organization to do it.
[01:11:21.676 --> 01:11:22.817]  And it's a huge amount of work.
[01:11:22.877 --> 01:11:25.699]  I mean, folks, it's easy on your end, and I commend you.
[01:11:25.999 --> 01:11:30.562]  You've just got to spread the word about the TV show, about the network, whatever it is we're going to set up.
[01:11:30.802 --> 01:11:33.684]  It'll at least be a weekend show and then beta test it from there.
[01:11:33.704 --> 01:11:35.785]  And I've got to be frank with you.
[01:11:36.225 --> 01:11:40.488]  I have piled up a little bit of money, but only because my overhead is so huge.
[01:11:42.529 --> 01:11:42.689]  Yeah.
[01:11:58.200 --> 01:11:58.440]  Yes, sir.
[01:12:13.947 --> 01:12:22.954]  And then I look at this little bit of money I've got piled up where I could run my business for a few months if I got attacked, shut down, had no capital coming in.
[01:12:23.414 --> 01:12:25.315]  I've got a few months of operating capital.
[01:12:25.795 --> 01:12:27.036]  And I thought, man, I'll gamble.
[01:12:27.056 --> 01:12:30.839]  I'll just go ahead and blow all that and try to get some TV network up.
[01:12:30.859 --> 01:12:35.122]  And I thought, well, I better go slow and just do a weekly show and then a weekday show.
[01:12:35.142 --> 01:12:36.183]  We don't need to gamble.
[01:12:36.203 --> 01:12:37.604]  We don't need to gamble, Alex.
[01:12:40.089 --> 01:12:43.651]  Your listeners, you, I, everyone, we need to ensure that this thing happens.
[01:12:43.851 --> 01:12:45.712]  You know, we don't need to take any chances.
[01:12:45.953 --> 01:12:50.535]  Because, you know, the big guys, the bad guys, man, they've got all the money in the world, they're not sweating it.
[01:12:50.735 --> 01:12:56.839]  And even if they were sweating it, you know, they're doing everything they can to just, you know, muscle us over and let that happen.
[01:12:56.879 --> 01:13:00.861]  Well, I mean, I agree, but I don't also want to imply that we're going to save the world with this one movement.
[01:13:00.961 --> 01:13:03.503]  It's the spirit of fighting, the spirit of building.
[01:13:03.703 --> 01:13:11.011]  The spirit of trying a TV show, the spirit of putting all my capital that I've got into it, and my children's small college funds.
[01:13:11.511 --> 01:13:18.799]  It's the spirit of just giving it all, trying, because we got in this position of being slaves by not trying.
[01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:23.423]  And so we're going to go all the way and I'm excited you're doing this.
[01:13:23.883 --> 01:13:31.589]  And I want to thank you because you really showed me Eric Nordstrom because I was kind of timid.
[01:13:31.609 --> 01:13:34.011]  I was like, alright, I'm going to go ahead and sign the lease.
[01:13:34.031 --> 01:13:35.953]  I'm going to go ahead and try to move into this bigger building.
[01:13:36.613 --> 01:14:04.882]  I'm going to go ahead and build a stage and put in a green screen and I guess go buy some suits and God and work even harder and you know I want to go fishing and I want to go drink beer and I just said you know what I'm doing it and I decided on that vacation and I already decided a few days before and then I thought about the money bomb and then I thought about it the last few days I said why not just throw myself at it why not just go ahead and beg for money you know I mean I mean because it's for a good cause I know I'm good
[01:14:05.442 --> 01:14:12.091]  I know the neocons and others are going to attack us, but they're allowed to beg for money and steal our money and ship in drugs and use it against us for the money they get.
[01:14:12.451 --> 01:14:15.475]  So yes, I'm asking listeners, give us the capital.
[01:14:16.236 --> 01:14:18.759]  You have my word of honor that 100% of the Money Bomb money
[01:14:21.462 --> 01:14:26.244]  We'll be a portion to side and we'll go towards the TV show and the new office.
[01:14:26.764 --> 01:14:32.867]  And I say that because 100% of the money from video sales and advertising does not go to my office in what I do.
[01:14:32.887 --> 01:14:34.367]  Like I said, I had an accountant do it.
[01:14:34.387 --> 01:14:36.608]  About 5-6% or so goes to me.
[01:14:37.309 --> 01:14:39.990]  And so, you know, that's the bottom line there.
[01:14:41.670 --> 01:14:43.011]  That is what this is all about.
[01:14:43.311 --> 01:14:45.151]  And we're going to go all the way.
[01:14:45.171 --> 01:14:46.712]  We're going to do the best job we can.
[01:14:47.012 --> 01:14:48.753]  And I'm going to then scout out talent.
[01:14:48.813 --> 01:14:50.233]  It's such a monumental job.
[01:14:51.653 --> 01:14:55.595]  And then I've got to pick talent that I know won't slander people or go crazy or who aren't agents.
[01:14:55.915 --> 01:14:57.835]  There's lots of pitfalls in this, but that doesn't matter.
[01:14:58.055 --> 01:14:59.296]  I'm not going to stay focused on that.
[01:14:59.336 --> 01:15:00.276]  I'm going to take action.
[01:15:00.736 --> 01:15:02.417]  And I'm looking at my limited crew out there.
[01:15:02.437 --> 01:15:03.557]  We're going to hire more people.
[01:15:03.857 --> 01:15:04.758]  That's a major job.
[01:15:04.818 --> 01:15:08.459]  And we're getting commitments from them right now that they're going to bust their butt, huh?
[01:15:09.079 --> 01:15:10.500]  Going to bust your butt launching this?
[01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:11.660]  I got a commitment.
[01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:28.806]  Alright, I mean, we're going to do this, because I can't do it alone, and I really want to thank you, Eric, because I don't want to get all mushy, but I think it's really a sign that separately, because when James Well was talking about his own network, so he couldn't be shut down, I was thinking, yeah, I've got to do my own thing.
[01:15:29.367 --> 01:15:30.447]  And not just with Genesis.
[01:15:30.487 --> 01:15:35.389]  I like Genesis, like Ted, like what he's doing, and I'm certainly going to invite him to be part of this new network.
[01:15:36.429 --> 01:15:37.950]  It's just that I need my own thing.
[01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:39.331]  We need more things.
[01:15:39.371 --> 01:15:42.456]  Like you said, you mentioned a few other networks out there.
[01:15:42.837 --> 01:15:43.598]  I'm all for them.
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:47.944]  In fact, I've always reached out to other people as long as they don't attack me.
[01:15:48.224 --> 01:15:50.348]  Because for me, this isn't about ego or a business.
[01:15:50.748 --> 01:15:52.771]  This is about warning people.
[01:15:52.811 --> 01:15:53.793]  Anything else you want to add?
[01:15:56.361 --> 01:15:58.843]  No sir, just thank you for all you're doing.
[01:15:59.123 --> 01:16:07.788]  I view your organization as definitely a spear and we need to defend the Constitution.
[01:16:08.248 --> 01:16:09.969]  That's basically why I got into the whole thing.
[01:16:10.029 --> 01:16:10.810]  I'm active duty.
[01:16:11.410 --> 01:16:17.354]  I've been in 14 years now and I'm doing everything I can to basically reinstate the Constitution.
[01:16:18.166 --> 01:16:18.627]  Yes, sir.
[01:16:37.563 --> 01:16:41.586]  What else is, I mean, you're in the military, what are you, in the Army or Marine Corps?
[01:16:41.666 --> 01:16:42.266]  I'm in the Air Force.
[01:16:42.506 --> 01:16:42.906]  Air Force?
[01:16:43.407 --> 01:16:51.872]  Are other people in the military, and I know 70-some percent of Ron Paul's donations, well, he got 70-plus percent of the military donations to Republicans.
[01:16:51.892 --> 01:16:55.114]  I mean, he got the vast majority, more than all the others combined.
[01:16:55.134 --> 01:16:58.376]  I mean, what are you seeing in the Air Force?
[01:16:58.436 --> 01:17:01.298]  Are people talking, or I guess they just keep their mouths shut?
[01:17:03.618 --> 01:17:07.719]  Well, the Air Force is no different than... I mean, I hear a lot of talking on a lot of shows.
[01:17:07.799 --> 01:17:10.580]  People like to basically compartmentalize people.
[01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:12.861]  But we're no different than anyone else.
[01:17:13.341 --> 01:17:14.642]  We're citizens of the United States.
[01:17:14.822 --> 01:17:15.902]  We're doing the best we can.
[01:17:16.702 --> 01:17:21.404]  We get the same news feeds from the corporate broadcasters.
[01:17:21.424 --> 01:17:25.685]  We get an additional dose of military information.
[01:17:26.747 --> 01:17:28.328]  Other than that, no difference.
[01:17:29.008 --> 01:17:35.171]  But as far as support for Ron Paul, yeah, there's a lot of support for Ron Paul.
[01:17:35.892 --> 01:17:38.633]  I'd say I probably have around 20 people in my work center.
[01:17:39.414 --> 01:17:42.555]  Because I'm in my work center, everyone knows who Ron Paul is.
[01:17:43.095 --> 01:17:46.137]  And now everybody's becoming very familiar with Alex Jones as well.
[01:17:46.297 --> 01:17:50.058]  Well, our military and our police, by and large, want to be the good guys.
[01:17:50.098 --> 01:17:51.238]  They want to be guardians.
[01:17:51.658 --> 01:17:54.659]  And they're trying to kick the good people out and bring in felons and crooks.
[01:17:54.739 --> 01:17:56.859]  And we've just got to fight this.
[01:17:56.979 --> 01:18:00.080]  And I'm willing to go all the way, be in prison, be killed for this.
[01:18:00.620 --> 01:18:01.400]  I am in a war.
[01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:02.380]  You know we're in a war.
[01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:03.661]  And I'm never stopping.
[01:18:03.701 --> 01:18:10.542]  And so I thought, over the weekend, looking out at the beach, down at the Texas coast, taking a few days off with the family, I thought, I'm already all the way.
[01:18:10.582 --> 01:18:11.622]  I'm already totally committed.
[01:18:11.922 --> 01:18:13.043]  Why not work even harder?
[01:18:13.083 --> 01:18:14.723]  Why not go ahead and go to the next level?
[01:18:15.383 --> 01:18:16.564]  And that's what life's all about.
[01:18:16.624 --> 01:18:19.165]  And so I commend you, Eric Nordstrom.
[01:18:19.225 --> 01:18:20.846]  I need to talk to you in the next few days.
[01:18:20.886 --> 01:18:22.426]  I've got to run out to like five meetings now.
[01:18:22.466 --> 01:18:24.807]  But let me give you a call so I can thank you privately.
[01:18:25.247 --> 01:18:26.788]  And I'm glad that we could talk here on air.
[01:18:27.308 --> 01:18:34.091]  And InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com, links up on InfoWars and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:18:34.592 --> 01:18:40.314]  And I'm asking all the people to go there and pledge to give $5, $10, $100, whatever you can.
[01:18:40.354 --> 01:18:41.995]  You have my commitment, my word of honor.
[01:18:44.776 --> 01:18:47.478]  I just want to thank you Eric Nordstrom.
[01:19:11.650 --> 01:19:12.130]  Thank you, sir.
[01:19:12.651 --> 01:19:13.011]  Thank you.
[01:19:13.031 --> 01:19:13.771]  Very, very exciting.
[01:19:13.811 --> 01:19:14.532]  Take care, my friend.
[01:19:15.092 --> 01:19:15.532]  All right.
[01:19:16.313 --> 01:19:16.673]  You bet.
[01:19:16.733 --> 01:19:16.993]  Wow.
[01:19:17.013 --> 01:19:18.133]  Well, that is just amazing.
[01:19:18.974 --> 01:19:20.595]  So he just learned about me in the recent past.
[01:19:20.615 --> 01:19:22.056]  I was wrong about saying he was a long-term listener.
[01:19:22.256 --> 01:19:24.697]  I guess it was Trevor Lyman said on air he woke up from this show.
[01:19:25.998 --> 01:19:29.219]  We wish Trevor and everybody else good luck with the network they're trying to set up.
[01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:32.021]  But money isn't everything.
[01:19:32.041 --> 01:19:35.483]  You've got to have the other ingredients, the audience, the people to spread the word about the show.
[01:19:36.143 --> 01:19:37.444]  And like I said, there's the plan.
[01:19:38.669 --> 01:19:41.132]  My goal, because I can't do it here.
[01:19:41.433 --> 01:19:46.159]  I mean, if you saw my office, I'd hook a wireless to one of these cameras and walk around this place for people.
[01:19:47.261 --> 01:19:56.346]  That's one thing that drives some of the other Patriot leaders crazy is they hear about me constantly and I'm so big in their mind that they don't understand I'm just a regular guy that puts my pants on one leg at a time too.
[01:19:56.907 --> 01:19:59.668]  You know, we get support, if it wasn't for Alex Jones, he gets all the support.
[01:20:00.029 --> 01:20:01.109]  That's not how it works.
[01:20:01.470 --> 01:20:03.611]  I wake a lot of people up through my great listeners.
[01:20:03.991 --> 01:20:05.872]  They're the ones that carry the ball and spread the word.
[01:20:06.232 --> 01:20:09.354]  Then the movement gets bigger and then you get all those new people to listen to you.
[01:20:09.935 --> 01:20:16.459]  So I really don't appreciate all the other talk show hosts, and I mean most of them, bitching and griping about me because
[01:20:17.279 --> 01:20:19.962]  I mean, do you guys work 17, 18 hours a day?
[01:20:21.183 --> 01:20:24.887]  You don't do that, do you?
[01:20:25.128 --> 01:20:27.030]  I mean, look, I know this is life and death, folks.
[01:20:27.370 --> 01:20:30.273]  I'm not going to waste my life on an effort and not try to win.
[01:20:30.293 --> 01:20:37.441]  And so instead, people out there are getting jealous of what I do and the things I do.
[01:20:37.521 --> 01:20:38.102]  You shouldn't be.
[01:20:38.993 --> 01:20:40.714]  I mean there's nothing to be jealous of.
[01:20:40.834 --> 01:20:43.594]  This is not about who the big stud is and who the leader is.
[01:20:44.355 --> 01:20:45.915]  It's a very dangerous position I'm in.
[01:20:46.395 --> 01:20:49.976]  You ought to be glad that I wake up all these people in like pilot fish.
[01:20:50.137 --> 01:20:51.997]  It's like I'm a great white shark with a big piece of meat.
[01:20:52.317 --> 01:20:53.998]  All these chunklets are falling out for you.
[01:20:55.339 --> 01:21:03.046]  You know, instead you wish I just wasn't there and the big chunk of people that we've woken up weren't there, so you'd be out in the wild blue yonder not drafting off me.
[01:21:03.066 --> 01:21:06.630]  I mean, that's really what this comes down to.
[01:21:07.010 --> 01:21:09.613]  But again, it's not me you're drafting off of, it's my listeners.
[01:21:09.973 --> 01:21:11.675]  Because I have the listeners with discernment.
[01:21:12.596 --> 01:21:14.878]  I've seen other talk shows where they pitch Miracle.
[01:21:16.715 --> 01:21:25.160]  You know, stuff, and magic cancer cures, and all this crap, and rife machines, and it still gets aired on some of the ads, and I can't control it, and Ted tries to ban it all.
[01:21:25.501 --> 01:21:26.081]  I love Ted.
[01:21:26.301 --> 01:21:26.981]  He's a good guy.
[01:21:27.542 --> 01:21:31.044]  But, you know, people know that the Patriots are good people, but they're also gullible.
[01:21:31.865 --> 01:21:38.089]  And so, just because mainstream media lies, doesn't mean that alternative media is completely trustworthy.
[01:21:38.929 --> 01:21:43.092]  And the untrustworthy people in our movement mainly aren't government agents, they're just opportunists.
[01:21:44.284 --> 01:21:45.906]  And I'm not perfect, but you know what?
[01:21:45.946 --> 01:21:47.187]  My name's what matters to me.
[01:21:47.968 --> 01:21:50.830]  And who I am is what matters to me, and the fact that I am a good guy.
[01:21:52.192 --> 01:21:55.035]  And I do cry during the Star Spangled Banner, and I don't know why.
[01:21:55.902 --> 01:21:59.866]  And I really do cry when I hear about CPS taking innocent children.
[01:22:00.046 --> 01:22:02.529]  When I've gone down to hospitals and tried to stop the police from it.
[01:22:03.229 --> 01:22:04.390]  I mean, that has changed me.
[01:22:04.430 --> 01:22:06.693]  That has created incredible rage in me.
[01:22:07.593 --> 01:22:08.094]  And anger.
[01:22:08.835 --> 01:22:09.535]  And commitment.
[01:22:10.336 --> 01:22:12.118]  And, you know, I see these other talk shows.
[01:22:12.298 --> 01:22:14.580]  They say you can sell 20% of anybody anything.
[01:22:15.541 --> 01:22:24.388]  And so there's these talk shows where they've got these gullible audiences where they just sell them magic products all day, but then all they've got is an idiot audience that'll believe anything.
[01:22:24.868 --> 01:22:26.049]  You know why this show's special?
[01:22:26.309 --> 01:22:33.915]  Why Greg Pallas and all these other people come on, Jesse Ventura and so many others come on and say, man, we get the big response on your show.
[01:22:33.955 --> 01:22:34.896]  Willie Nelson said that.
[01:22:34.956 --> 01:22:35.856]  Ron Paul has said that.
[01:22:36.337 --> 01:22:40.240]  It's like the show's big, we've got a few million listeners, but the few million we've got are the best.
[01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:42.281]  They're the men and women that have discernment.
[01:22:42.882 --> 01:22:46.364]  They're the people who know these other patriots are sad excuses.
[01:22:46.985 --> 01:22:49.267]  Who know that I'm the real deal.
[01:22:49.307 --> 01:22:51.248]  Who in their gut know I'm the real deal.
[01:22:51.528 --> 01:22:53.770]  And no amount of COINTELPRO crap is going to work.
[01:22:54.571 --> 01:22:55.812]  Because I am the real deal, folks.
[01:22:55.852 --> 01:22:56.873]  This is who I am.
[01:22:59.174 --> 01:23:02.377]  Fake government operatives or BSers can't work 18 hours a day.
[01:23:02.417 --> 01:23:04.178]  They don't have the drive, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:05.379 --> 01:23:05.800]  I have it.
[01:23:06.812 --> 01:23:09.055]  Because I am a hillbilly.
[01:23:09.655 --> 01:23:10.837]  I am the real deal, folks.
[01:23:12.278 --> 01:23:15.402]  I mean, and I know a lot of you are the real deal.
[01:23:16.023 --> 01:23:16.904]  We're the common people.
[01:23:17.898 --> 01:23:20.040]  We've just got to get mad and start taking action.
[01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:25.765]  Instead of letting all the snake oil salesmen and con artists in government, in our own movement, in alternative media.
[01:23:26.165 --> 01:23:29.108]  I mean, that's why every other person lines up to attack me.
[01:23:29.188 --> 01:23:30.149]  I mean, 90% of them attack me.
[01:23:30.529 --> 01:23:40.778]  Unless they're Pastor Butch Paw or Jack McClam or a few dozen others or classy guys like George Norrie who are good people.
[01:23:41.839 --> 01:23:44.761]  And I've been hurt by the fact that our movement is infested with scum.
[01:23:46.315 --> 01:23:48.317]  And they all attack me out of egomania.
[01:23:49.518 --> 01:23:52.862]  And it's wrong because it's not that I'm mad that I'm being attacked.
[01:23:54.884 --> 01:23:57.246]  I've had my headphones on so long it's hurting the top of my head.
[01:23:57.266 --> 01:24:02.351]  It's like it's wearing a bald spot on the top of my head too from these things being up there.
[01:24:04.213 --> 01:24:09.217]  The key here is I don't take myself seriously, folks, but I take the information that I'm putting out seriously.
[01:24:09.258 --> 01:24:10.118]  You understand the difference there?
[01:24:11.232 --> 01:24:12.873]  And I don't do the job right.
[01:24:13.653 --> 01:24:20.037]  You ever seen that movie, Stanley Kubrick, Full Metal Jacket, where he says, you know, you're fired, Private Snowball.
[01:24:20.717 --> 01:24:22.498]  Private Joker is now squad leader.
[01:24:23.359 --> 01:24:27.161]  And he says, Private Joker is silly and he's ignorant, but he's got guts and guts is enough.
[01:24:27.681 --> 01:24:28.982]  And I know you've got guts.
[01:24:29.042 --> 01:24:32.044]  You've just been told it doesn't matter if you've got guts, you can't affect change.
[01:24:32.324 --> 01:24:33.905]  That's a lie from the New World Order.
[01:24:34.305 --> 01:24:35.946]  You've got guts and guts is enough.
[01:24:36.266 --> 01:24:39.487]  And I'm not right about everything, and I'm not perfect, and I make mistakes.
[01:24:39.827 --> 01:24:40.348]  But you know what?
[01:24:40.368 --> 01:24:43.809]  At the end of the day, I mean what I say, and I'm trying to tell the truth.
[01:24:44.529 --> 01:24:48.291]  And that's all I've got in my life, is my name and my word.
[01:24:48.531 --> 01:24:49.431]  And my word's good.
[01:24:50.251 --> 01:24:50.571]  Okay?
[01:24:50.591 --> 01:24:54.453]  And I'm a friend to all who are my friend, and I'm an enemy to anybody that crosses me.
[01:24:55.353 --> 01:24:55.993]  You understand that?
[01:25:00.086 --> 01:25:02.128]  I'm also embarrassed that Bush claims he's a Texan.
[01:25:02.809 --> 01:25:04.311]  You know, I'm proud to be a real Texan.
[01:25:04.331 --> 01:25:08.055]  I'm proud to be somebody who tries to live up to what Texans were always known for.
[01:25:08.596 --> 01:25:16.905]  I try, you know, to be last of the Mohicans and actually be a good person in a world of cess and lies and backstabbing and scum and trash and filth.
[01:25:17.899 --> 01:25:20.701]  And it hurts me at a certain level.
[01:25:20.721 --> 01:25:23.803]  At a sick level, I like being attacked because it's always so ridiculous.
[01:25:24.484 --> 01:25:28.686]  But I know that's my defense mechanism, you know, my aggressiveness going, haha, it's funny.
[01:25:29.007 --> 01:25:31.628]  Deep down, it hurts my feelings because I know I'm real.
[01:25:32.029 --> 01:25:33.129]  And I know I'm the real McCoy.
[01:25:33.169 --> 01:25:36.552]  And I know I have passion and love for everybody out there who's good.
[01:25:36.892 --> 01:25:38.133]  And hatred for those that are bad.
[01:25:38.593 --> 01:25:39.914]  And war for those that are bad.
[01:25:39.954 --> 01:25:40.874]  That's what I have for you.
[01:25:41.795 --> 01:25:44.096]  And I'm coming for you and I'm doing everything I can to beat you.
[01:25:44.396 --> 01:25:45.536]  I'm throwing everything at you.
[01:25:46.076 --> 01:25:47.436]  And look, that isn't much.
[01:25:47.516 --> 01:25:48.117]  I'm not much.
[01:25:48.177 --> 01:25:51.237]  I'm a failed, fallen human.
[01:25:51.297 --> 01:25:51.917]  But you know what?
[01:25:52.077 --> 01:25:56.558]  I know I'm for real and that's... I know the enemy wants to teach you you can't trust anybody.
[01:25:56.959 --> 01:25:59.279]  I know the enemy wants to teach you that you can't affect change.
[01:25:59.299 --> 01:25:59.679]  But you know what?
[01:25:59.719 --> 01:26:00.639]  You can trust yourself.
[01:26:01.420 --> 01:26:02.660]  You can start a neighborhood newsletter.
[01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:06.641]  You can watch my films and know they wake people up and get them to make copies and give them to everybody.
[01:26:07.361 --> 01:26:08.402]  You can make your own film.
[01:26:08.422 --> 01:26:09.463]  You don't think you can?
[01:26:09.503 --> 01:26:10.123]  You can learn how.
[01:26:10.163 --> 01:26:11.344]  It's easy with the software now.
[01:26:11.825 --> 01:26:13.106]  You can go on and be great leaders.
[01:26:13.166 --> 01:26:13.926]  I've always said this.
[01:26:14.207 --> 01:26:18.690]  There are men and women out there watching right now who are much smarter and much more eloquent than I am.
[01:26:19.271 --> 01:26:19.831]  Where are you?
[01:26:19.871 --> 01:26:20.452]  We need you.
[01:26:21.012 --> 01:26:21.693]  They can kill me.
[01:26:23.285 --> 01:26:25.406]  But they can't kill ideas.
[01:26:26.507 --> 01:26:28.128]  And that's what I want to know.
[01:26:28.148 --> 01:26:29.129]  I want you to go forward.
[01:26:29.169 --> 01:26:30.169]  I want you to move forward.
[01:26:30.510 --> 01:26:32.771]  And I don't want them to take the real heroes away from you.
[01:26:32.791 --> 01:26:34.252]  Because there are good men and women out there.
[01:26:34.712 --> 01:26:35.993]  There are true people out there.
[01:26:36.393 --> 01:26:37.094]  There are people.
[01:26:37.174 --> 01:26:38.295]  And you know you're one of them.
[01:26:38.375 --> 01:26:39.596]  So it's up to you.
[01:26:39.656 --> 01:26:40.696]  You know you're good.
[01:26:41.117 --> 01:26:43.178]  You know you've got passion.
[01:26:43.218 --> 01:26:45.439]  You know you care about liberty and freedom.
[01:26:45.539 --> 01:26:48.481]  And you have to have confidence in yourself and take action.
[01:26:49.762 --> 01:26:50.163]  I've got to go.
[01:26:50.183 --> 01:26:54.246]  I've got to go do a few meetings and run home and see my family for a few hours because I've got to work again tonight.
[01:26:55.327 --> 01:26:58.050]  And I'll see everybody Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:26:58.110 --> 01:27:02.814]  on the Sunday syndicated show we do and all the sponsors, listeners, affiliates, folks running the show.
[01:27:03.695 --> 01:27:04.676]  I commend you and love you.
[01:27:05.176 --> 01:27:06.257]  Infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[01:27:09.380 --> 01:27:13.463]  We'll be back Sunday live, and then I'll see you at the Alamo Draft House Saturday and Sunday, and I'll see you Monday live.
[01:27:13.483 --> 01:27:15.845]  I've got a bunch of radio interviews I'm doing this weekend as well.
[01:27:16.465 --> 01:27:18.046]  Alright, have a great weekend.
[01:27:18.547 --> 01:27:22.089]  Remember, truth will prevail, goodness will prevail, the meek will inherit the earth.
[01:27:22.469 --> 01:27:28.794]  In the end, I guess that means the evil New World Order and aggressive rednecks like me won't be around then, but you will inherit the earth.
[01:27:29.234 --> 01:27:30.555]  So put one foot in front of the other.
[01:27:30.575 --> 01:27:32.957]  We're coming for the big win against the New World Order.
[01:27:33.197 --> 01:27:34.698]  Again, I want to commend Eric Nordstrom.
[01:27:34.958 --> 01:27:36.900]  I was really impressed talking to him live on air.
[01:27:37.540 --> 01:27:38.221]  God bless you all.
