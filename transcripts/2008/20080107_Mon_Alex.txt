[00:00:06.053 --> 00:00:06.713]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.354 --> 00:00:08.415]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.115 --> 00:00:10.216]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.896 --> 00:00:11.697]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.477 --> 00:00:14.378]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.398 --> 00:00:17.680]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.221 --> 00:00:22.263]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.636 --> 00:00:35.679]  We are very, very close to getting Barry Goldwater Jr.
[00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:37.581]  on today or tomorrow.
[00:00:37.601 --> 00:00:42.224]  I didn't think to tell my producer to get him on until this morning.
[00:00:42.244 --> 00:00:46.388]  It's nice to be able to just pick up the phone and call the chairman of the Ron Paul campaign.
[00:00:47.288 --> 00:00:48.870]  Or the head of the campaign, Ken Schneider.
[00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:49.991]  He is just such a great guy.
[00:00:50.731 --> 00:00:56.035]  Of course, Ron Paul was attacked on Fox this morning for not being there to come on Fox.
[00:00:56.075 --> 00:00:58.037]  That's kind of hard because he got on an airplane.
[00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:07.282]  Late last night and flew to Los Angeles, and I hope he's still asleep, I guess he probably just woke up, to go on Jay Leno's show tonight for a full 15 minutes.
[00:01:08.103 --> 00:01:09.946]  Oh, who's getting all the attention?
[00:01:11.087 --> 00:01:13.972]  The reason I want to get Barry Goldwater Jr., the congressman,
[00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:15.831]  We're good to go.
[00:01:38.985 --> 00:01:46.187]  And then LBJ ran nuking ads showing A-bombs going off, saying, vote for Goldwater, and this little girl's going to die.
[00:01:46.207 --> 00:01:48.368]  And it would show the nuke killing the little girl.
[00:01:48.988 --> 00:01:50.069]  Fred Thompson's tried it.
[00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:56.631]  But I was watching Fred Thompson last night give a speech on C-SPAN, and his hands were shaking so bad.
[00:01:56.651 --> 00:01:59.071]  I mean, I've had a lot of family die of cancer.
[00:01:59.111 --> 00:02:00.012]  Most of you have, too.
[00:02:00.472 --> 00:02:02.492]  You can tell when somebody is on their way out.
[00:02:03.773 --> 00:02:05.073]  Or pretty darn close to it.
[00:02:05.653 --> 00:02:07.034]  Fred needs to be...
[00:02:09.116 --> 00:02:14.880]  Fred needs to do what Tony Snow did when they told him you don't have a very good chance of living.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.902]  He needs to retire and quickly.
[00:02:17.782 --> 00:02:24.867]  I mean, it is just pathetic to watch him up there as a shill for the neocons trying to pose as a conservative so they can get one of their Democrats in.
[00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:28.450]  Unbelievable.
[00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.931]  But side issue there.
[00:02:31.592 --> 00:02:33.473]  We're lining up Barry Goldwater Jr.
[00:02:33.573 --> 00:02:34.234]  for the show.
[00:02:34.254 --> 00:02:35.815]  Looks like today, if not tomorrow...
[00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.780]  I literally just got on this 30 minutes ago, and it looks like we're going to get him.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:48.921]  And we have Mike Rivera, who's been tracking election fraud and all the evidence of election fraud in Iowa that came in suppressing Paul.
[00:02:49.481 --> 00:02:58.323]  I've also read some of the analysis by Bev Harris, who, of course, helped produce the HBO special concerning election fraud.
[00:02:58.523 --> 00:03:01.623]  And we're going to be talking about what went on in Iowa.
[00:03:03.303 --> 00:03:06.464]  Some people criticized me for talking about election fraud.
[00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:09.080]  And saying it could be a possibility.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.161]  Well, we've had it so many times in the past.
[00:03:11.882 --> 00:03:13.582]  It's always a possibility.
[00:03:15.203 --> 00:03:20.446]  That's why banks have vaults, because there's a possibility someone may walk in and try to rob them.
[00:03:21.126 --> 00:03:22.727]  That's why doors have locks.
[00:03:23.248 --> 00:03:33.193]  There's a possibility somebody may try to come in your house and steal your computer, your jewelry, or your body, rape you, or worse, kill you.
[00:03:34.253 --> 00:03:39.437]  So, some of the sites, I don't understand it, that have said, How dare Alex Jones say there could have been some fraud?
[00:03:39.457 --> 00:03:40.898]  There's no such thing!
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:51.846]  Those are some of the same sites, though, that said that Fox News had not banned Ron Paul from the debate.
[00:03:51.866 --> 00:03:59.331]  I'm not attacking them, but they need to stop throwing stones when they live in a big, fat, glass house.
[00:04:01.584 --> 00:04:06.708]  But the issue here isn't that websites are saying I'm crazy and there's no evidence of election fraud.
[00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:15.496]  The issue is that people are psychologically inoculated against even believing that such a thing could be happening and going on.
[00:04:16.117 --> 00:04:19.339]  And you know, the first few days after Iowa, I said, I don't know if there's any fraud.
[00:04:21.601 --> 00:04:23.763]  We'll have to see, but I think you should have done better than 10%.
[00:04:24.504 --> 00:04:29.228]  10% is still good in that process, that gamed process, and
[00:04:29.861 --> 00:04:36.384]  Then the evidence came out, and just like the evidence of them killing Budo, and the government being involved in that came out, so we covered it.
[00:04:37.124 --> 00:04:38.805]  We just cover where the evidence leads us.
[00:04:39.546 --> 00:04:42.587]  So Mike Rivera's popping in for about ten minutes coming up this hour.
[00:04:43.988 --> 00:04:47.869]  We've got some new documents on the North American Union Trans-Texas Corridor.
[00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.651]  These are documents and maps nobody else has got.
[00:04:51.451 --> 00:04:52.532]  That's coming up in an hour.
[00:04:52.552 --> 00:04:56.173]  It's all going to be transmitted here today.
[00:04:56.253 --> 00:04:57.014]  Big transmission.
[00:04:57.034 --> 00:04:57.434]  Stay with us.
[00:05:02.156 --> 00:05:03.556]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:03.576 --> 00:05:05.697]  A new world order.
[00:05:06.397 --> 00:05:10.638]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:05:11.358 --> 00:05:13.059]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:16.380]  Isn't their objective being world domination?
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.360]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:20.081 --> 00:05:27.463]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:30.436 --> 00:05:35.439]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.362]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:39.742 --> 00:05:42.264]  They'll make great progress toward a world of government.
[00:05:42.324 --> 00:05:43.465]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:43.485 --> 00:05:44.205]  They're not after money.
[00:05:44.225 --> 00:05:45.346]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:45.526 --> 00:05:46.267]  They're after power.
[00:05:46.527 --> 00:05:47.327]  That's what happens.
[00:05:47.668 --> 00:05:55.873]  Order Endgame on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.

[00:07:01.044 --> 00:07:02.546]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond.

[00:08:02.906 --> 00:08:08.932]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.553 --> 00:08:12.536]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.005 --> 00:08:16.946]  We're good to go.
[00:08:16.986 --> 00:08:17.987]  We're good to go.
[00:08:48.595 --> 00:08:49.576]  Good morning, Mr. Beale.
[00:08:50.276 --> 00:08:51.577]  They tell me you're a madman.
[00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:52.718]  Only dizzle to relate.
[00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:53.739]  How are you now?
[00:08:53.919 --> 00:08:54.780]  I'm as mad as a hacker.
[00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:56.261]  Who is he?
[00:08:58.223 --> 00:08:59.984]  I'm going to take you into our conference room.
[00:09:00.025 --> 00:09:02.426]  Seems more seemly a setting for what I have to say to you.
[00:09:05.189 --> 00:09:06.850]  I started as a salesman, Mr. Beale.
[00:09:07.771 --> 00:09:12.855]  I sold sewing machines and automobile parts, hairbrushes and electronic equipment.
[00:09:13.696 --> 00:09:14.957]  They say I can sell anything.
[00:09:16.889 --> 00:09:19.014]  I'd like to try to sell something to you.
[00:09:19.034 --> 00:09:26.353]  Mr. Beale, please sit down.
[00:09:56.812 --> 00:10:03.818]  You have meddled with the primal forces of nature, Mr. Neal, and I won't have it!
[00:10:04.658 --> 00:10:05.099]  Is that clear?
[00:10:05.119 --> 00:10:08.802]  You think you merely stopped a business deal.
[00:10:09.002 --> 00:10:10.383]  That is not the case.
[00:10:10.983 --> 00:10:14.746]  The Arabs have taken billions of dollars out of this country, and now they must put it back!
[00:10:16.027 --> 00:10:18.749]  It is air and flow, tidal gravity.
[00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:20.591]  It is ecological balance.
[00:10:22.668 --> 00:10:28.411]  You are an old man who thinks in terms of nations and peoples.
[00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:29.671]  There are no nations.
[00:10:29.911 --> 00:10:30.792]  There are no peoples.
[00:10:31.072 --> 00:10:31.992]  There are no Russians.
[00:10:32.192 --> 00:10:33.113]  There are no Arabs.
[00:10:33.333 --> 00:10:34.533]  There are no third worlds.
[00:10:34.573 --> 00:10:35.414]  There is no West.
[00:10:36.084 --> 00:10:40.809]  There is only one holistic system of systems.
[00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:49.018]  One vast and imane, interwoven, interacting, multivariate, multinational dominion of dollars.
[00:10:49.999 --> 00:10:57.927]  Petrodollars, electrodollars, multidollars, reichmarks, rins, rubles, pounds, and seconds.
[00:11:00.427 --> 00:11:07.829]  It is the international system of currency which determines the totality of life on this planet.
[00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:13.331]  That is the natural order of things today.
[00:11:15.032 --> 00:11:25.095]  That is the atomic and sub-atomic and galactic structure of things today.
[00:11:27.333 --> 00:11:32.796]  And you have meddled with the primal forces of nature!
[00:11:34.577 --> 00:11:39.199]  And you will atone!
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.721]  Am I getting through to you, Mr. B?
[00:11:46.283 --> 00:11:55.468]  You get up on your little 21-inch screen and howl about America and democracy.
[00:11:57.048 --> 00:11:58.209]  There is no America.
[00:11:59.069 --> 00:12:00.550]  There is no democracy.
[00:12:01.571 --> 00:12:11.937]  There is only IBM and ITT and AT&T and DuPont, Dow, Union Carbide and Exxon.
[00:12:13.037 --> 00:12:15.579]  Those are the nations of the world today.
[00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.421]  What do you think the Russians talk about in their councils of state?
[00:12:19.821 --> 00:12:20.301]  Karl Marx?
[00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:23.023]  They get out their linear programming charts
[00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:25.710]  The world is a business, Mr. B.
[00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:58.312]  It has been since man crawled out of the slime.
[00:13:01.895 --> 00:13:21.348]  And our children will live, Mr. Beale, to see that perfect world in which there's no war or famine, oppression or brutality.
[00:13:23.752 --> 00:13:35.558]  One vast and ecumenical holding company, for whom all men will work to serve a common profit, in which all men will hold a share of stock.
[00:13:37.679 --> 00:13:46.964]  All necessities provided, all anxieties tranquilized, all boredom
[00:13:56.127 --> 00:14:02.152]  And I have chosen you, Mr. Beale, to preach this evangel.
[00:14:03.753 --> 00:14:04.433]  Why me?
[00:14:06.655 --> 00:14:08.537]  Because you're on television, dummy.
[00:14:10.738 --> 00:14:14.982]  Sixty million people watch you every night of the week, Monday through Friday.
[00:14:17.103 --> 00:14:18.745]  I have seen the face of God.
[00:14:21.727 --> 00:14:23.188]  You just might be right, Mr. Beale.
[00:14:26.385 --> 00:14:30.469]  All right, that is from the movie back in the mid-1970s, Network.
[00:14:30.689 --> 00:14:36.774]  All of you should get it at the video store or order it online or buy it at Best Buy or whatever your fancy is.
[00:14:38.336 --> 00:14:41.398]  Because it is a New World Order film, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:41.859 --> 00:14:53.509]  What you just heard there in those five and a half minutes is actually laid out in hundreds of Stanford Research Institute, Carnegie, Ford Endowments,
[00:14:55.095 --> 00:15:02.078]  It's laid out by Georgetown, statements and documents, all public, going back to the 50s and 60s.
[00:15:02.138 --> 00:15:13.143]  Now, the truth is, they want a global government so that they can then carry out mass eugenics, unbridled, with no one resisting them.
[00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:21.605]  And you notice now that was made in the 70s about how they had all these currencies and how it was all for order and happiness.
[00:15:22.005 --> 00:15:25.087]  You notice they're killing the dollar by design right now.
[00:15:25.667 --> 00:15:27.529]  Slowly killing it, starving it to death.
[00:15:27.549 --> 00:15:32.332]  Kind of like they did Terry Schiavo, chaining her down for 14 days until she finally died.
[00:15:34.273 --> 00:15:36.054]  And that's what they're doing to the dollar right now.
[00:15:36.094 --> 00:15:40.798]  They openly state in the Financial Times that they're slowly killing it so you don't struggle or freak out.
[00:15:40.838 --> 00:15:44.320]  Kind of like gently strangling you in your sleep.
[00:15:45.231 --> 00:15:46.832]  Nice pillow over the face.
[00:15:47.733 --> 00:15:55.640]  Maybe at the last moment you wake up and think you're dreaming, and then it's too late, and on to Valhalla and the Gooder Dameron, if that's your fancy.
[00:15:58.482 --> 00:16:00.624]  By the way, I talked about this some yesterday.
[00:16:00.644 --> 00:16:04.647]  I don't even know if I'll have time to get into it much today, because I did read more of it last night.
[00:16:06.048 --> 00:16:13.074]  My wife, we were at Half Price Books last week, and she picked up A State of Fear by Michael Crichton.
[00:16:14.648 --> 00:16:16.369]  And I'd only read Eaters of the Dead.
[00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:18.410]  That's the only Michael Crichton book I'd ever read.
[00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:24.053]  I'd seen Jurassic Park and ER TV show and The Andromeda Strain made into a movie.
[00:16:24.073 --> 00:16:27.135]  You know, he's one of the top three best-selling authors in the world right now.
[00:16:29.536 --> 00:16:31.578]  And she reads about a book a day.
[00:16:32.158 --> 00:16:34.199]  The point is, it doesn't matter.
[00:16:34.219 --> 00:16:36.300]  The point is, a few days later, she goes, this is an incredible book.
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:37.661]  Did you ever read this?
[00:16:38.501 --> 00:16:40.463]  Did you get your ideas for Endgame from this?
[00:16:40.583 --> 00:16:41.243]  And I said, no.
[00:16:41.323 --> 00:16:42.764]  I went out and researched documents and
[00:16:43.368 --> 00:16:49.151]  Government research documents, and that's, I mean, original, first-hand research.
[00:16:49.852 --> 00:16:52.433]  That doesn't mean somebody else hasn't gone out and done that same research.
[00:16:52.473 --> 00:16:55.315]  In fact, I'm sure thousands have done the original research.
[00:16:55.375 --> 00:16:56.596]  I just wanted to see it for myself.
[00:16:57.276 --> 00:16:59.537]  And she said, well, this is everything you say.
[00:17:01.318 --> 00:17:02.399]  And I said, well, what's it about?
[00:17:02.419 --> 00:17:08.342]  I don't want to give the whole book away from you, but it's a group staging environmental catastrophes to get a global environmental carbon tax.
[00:17:08.723 --> 00:17:10.444]  And she goes, but you just made Endgame.
[00:17:10.464 --> 00:17:11.064]  This came out in 2004.
[00:17:14.281 --> 00:17:15.301]  And I said, well, here, let me see it.
[00:17:16.301 --> 00:17:21.883]  And so I scanned through it, and then I read the appendixes at the back where he says, by the way, this isn't just fiction.
[00:17:22.643 --> 00:17:23.783]  There is a global group.
[00:17:23.823 --> 00:17:24.883]  This is what they're doing.
[00:17:24.924 --> 00:17:27.104]  They're using environmentalism to take control of you.
[00:17:27.504 --> 00:17:29.705]  Feudalism, global taxes, by the way.
[00:17:30.145 --> 00:17:31.245]  They're eugenicists.
[00:17:31.665 --> 00:17:33.165]  Rockefellers run it all.
[00:17:34.986 --> 00:17:36.606]  Michael Crichton.
[00:17:37.887 --> 00:17:39.127]  I cannot get over this.
[00:17:41.261 --> 00:17:44.043]  Again, people all the time think I'm omnipresent and know everything.
[00:17:44.143 --> 00:17:45.244]  I don't know a lot, folks.
[00:17:45.584 --> 00:17:47.646]  I know more than the average schlub out in the street.
[00:17:47.986 --> 00:17:49.467]  But that ain't saying very much.
[00:17:50.328 --> 00:17:51.629]  That's why I'm so freaked out.
[00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:56.293]  That I've got this knowledge, this info, I want to warn people.
[00:17:56.333 --> 00:17:57.173]  It's hardcore.
[00:17:58.494 --> 00:18:02.037]  And the yuppies just giggle and snicker and polish their beamers.
[00:18:05.581 --> 00:18:18.673]  But it was heartening to find out that Michael Crichton wrote this big fiction book, and then in the last third of the book, he has a bunch of chapters with environmental charts and sunspot charts and documents and, by the way, eugenics.
[00:18:20.114 --> 00:18:21.856]  Man, it's good to know other people know.
[00:18:23.237 --> 00:18:26.760]  But it's always a Bill Joy, owner of Sun Microsystems, co-chair.
[00:18:27.381 --> 00:18:36.006]  Who's got morals and comes out and says, I went to a meeting with the 200 heads of technology and the richest guys and they said there's a plan they're probably going to kill everybody.
[00:18:36.786 --> 00:18:37.747]  I'm warning you.
[00:18:37.767 --> 00:18:44.351]  You know, there are a few of these guys, I guess, that find out about the big plan and end up warning you.
[00:18:44.731 --> 00:18:47.012]  I mean, look, this stuff's real, okay?
[00:18:49.074 --> 00:18:54.377]  But it is heartening that Michael Crichton... I mean, anything he...
[00:18:55.758 --> 00:18:57.460]  Right sells like 20 million copies.
[00:18:58.381 --> 00:19:00.243]  And I thought he was in the top five writers.
[00:19:00.383 --> 00:19:01.084]  I looked it up right now.
[00:19:01.124 --> 00:19:02.565]  He's like number two writer in the world.
[00:19:04.047 --> 00:19:06.569]  Innumerable movies, TV shows, and spinoffs.
[00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:08.651]  The guy's made over a billion bucks himself.
[00:19:08.712 --> 00:19:16.139]  And my point is, that's not the gauge of a man completely, but... I mean, good job Michael Crichton knows about this.
[00:19:16.179 --> 00:19:16.820]  He writes a book.
[00:19:17.521 --> 00:19:19.922]  20-something million copies of it are sold.
[00:19:20.042 --> 00:19:21.303]  Fantastic, Mr. Crichton.
[00:19:22.163 --> 00:19:27.286]  But if you do know about all this, and you say you know about it at the end of the book, can we have a little bit more about this?
[00:19:27.426 --> 00:19:29.147]  Or maybe he hasn't read any of his other books.
[00:19:29.447 --> 00:19:30.007]  Maybe he died.
[00:19:30.047 --> 00:19:31.228]  Maybe all his books are about it.
[00:19:31.508 --> 00:19:37.111]  Can you call in later and tell me if Michael... Like, I had a few calls on the show about, hey, have you read State of Fear?
[00:19:37.131 --> 00:19:39.012]  And I'm like, no, well, it kind of talks about Endgame.
[00:19:39.752 --> 00:19:41.453]  And I kind of forget about it and go along, but...
[00:19:45.313 --> 00:19:48.618]  I don't know, it just makes me feel like we've got allies, we've got friends, we've got people.
[00:19:49.719 --> 00:19:53.524]  It's scary to think you're one of the only people that knows about this who's got a media platform.
[00:19:55.026 --> 00:19:56.648]  Believe me, I want everybody to talk about this.
[00:19:56.928 --> 00:19:58.170]  I want you to say it's your research.
[00:19:58.210 --> 00:19:59.051]  I want you to run with it.
[00:19:59.632 --> 00:20:00.153]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:02.972 --> 00:20:05.033]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:05.673 --> 00:20:14.577]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:15.038 --> 00:20:22.221]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:22.944 --> 00:20:26.806]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMed Inc.'

[00:24:46.814 --> 00:24:51.637]  I have a wonderlust to go hang out in the mountains and camp and go hunting and hiking.
[00:24:52.378 --> 00:24:55.881]  I'd love to go on one of those month-long hikes they do up into the hills and mountains.
[00:24:55.941 --> 00:24:57.782]  Colorado, Smokies, it wouldn't matter.
[00:24:59.203 --> 00:24:59.844]  I'd love to do it.
[00:24:59.864 --> 00:25:01.665]  But I've got to fight the New World Order and I've got a family.
[00:25:01.705 --> 00:25:04.027]  But every time I hear that song, it makes me think about it.
[00:25:04.855 --> 00:25:06.736]  Hiking around the wilderness and how much fun it is.
[00:25:06.816 --> 00:25:07.996]  All right, I'm already digressing.
[00:25:08.477 --> 00:25:16.160]  Mike Rivero joins us in about eight minutes, and then we have an in-studio surprise guest with breaking Trans-Texas Corridor New World Order news.

[00:25:19.341 --> 00:25:27.385]  will be popping in in the middle of the third hour today, campaigning for Congressman Ron Paul in New Hampshire right now.
[00:25:28.825 --> 00:25:31.106]  So that is coming up today.
[00:25:31.126 --> 00:25:32.587]  I've got to tell you, my producer...
[00:25:33.331 --> 00:25:35.492]  Trey Kincaid is just doing a fabulous job.
[00:25:35.972 --> 00:25:38.834]  Friday, we had the chairman of the Ron Paul campaign on.
[00:25:39.134 --> 00:25:40.235]  We had Trevor Lyman on.
[00:25:40.275 --> 00:25:42.256]  We had Rand Paul, Dr. Paul's son.
[00:25:43.076 --> 00:25:45.157]  We had Congressman Ron Paul on.
[00:25:46.178 --> 00:25:51.701]  And we had Big Daddy Don Garlitz on, the king of drag racing on, all in the same show.
[00:25:52.221 --> 00:25:57.124]  We've got some other big guests, by the way, we're working on as well that you'll be hearing from this week.
[00:25:59.269 --> 00:26:01.950]  Let me tell you about some of the other news I'm going to squeeze in today.
[00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:03.871]  I mentioned this some on the Sunday show.
[00:26:03.891 --> 00:26:05.051]  I didn't have enough time to get into it.
[00:26:05.111 --> 00:26:07.572]  Breathalyzer test, now the law at New Jersey High School.
[00:26:07.912 --> 00:26:09.393]  Then you read and there is no law.
[00:26:09.413 --> 00:26:10.293]  They just say it's the law.
[00:26:10.913 --> 00:26:14.075]  Real sign of criminal government when they just start saying things of the law that aren't.
[00:26:15.335 --> 00:26:19.777]  Also, if your hard drive could testify, and it's about how when you fly into the U.S.
[00:26:19.817 --> 00:26:21.037]  they search your hard drives now.
[00:26:21.417 --> 00:26:22.618]  Well, that happened to me in Canada.
[00:26:23.298 --> 00:26:24.738]  With the guy laughing the whole time.
[00:26:24.779 --> 00:26:26.379]  It was like out of a movie.
[00:26:26.919 --> 00:26:28.640]  And by the way, it is in a movie now called Endgame.
[00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:33.483]  GM researching driverless cars.
[00:26:33.503 --> 00:26:35.224]  AP says we'll have them within 10 years.
[00:26:35.985 --> 00:26:37.766]  Yeah, that's a great idea.
[00:26:37.906 --> 00:26:40.789]  China communist sacked after having too many children.
[00:26:40.849 --> 00:26:44.792]  State media, AFP, these all tie together police state news.
[00:26:46.193 --> 00:26:50.556]  Oh, by the way, it's come out that for the last few months when she's been tested, she's not on drugs.
[00:26:51.984 --> 00:26:53.804]  She's been, quote, missing her medication.
[00:26:53.824 --> 00:26:56.245]  She's on a bunch of Prozac class drugs.
[00:26:56.865 --> 00:26:58.325]  And, yeah, when you're on them, you're nuts.
[00:26:58.365 --> 00:26:59.685]  And when you go off of them, you're nuts.
[00:26:59.725 --> 00:27:00.906]  Or when they change them, you're nuts.
[00:27:01.506 --> 00:27:04.566]  And every time she's had one of these breaks, they've changed her medication.
[00:27:05.346 --> 00:27:06.887]  Somebody needs to get to Britney Spears.
[00:27:06.907 --> 00:27:08.027]  I actually know somebody that knows her.
[00:27:08.807 --> 00:27:15.088]  Somebody needs to get to her and get her to a retreat for a few months to get off those drugs or it's over.
[00:27:15.668 --> 00:27:19.569]  She'll end up being a dead in a year, suicided, killed and robbed.
[00:27:19.609 --> 00:27:20.309]  You know how they work.
[00:27:21.064 --> 00:27:23.225]  I mean, they are really going to town on her.
[00:27:23.285 --> 00:27:24.886]  It's claiming she kidnapped her children.
[00:27:25.466 --> 00:27:36.010]  She went off her drugs, was freaking out, was fighting on the phone with her stupid ex-husband, who as a father should have just dropped it for a few days until the fight stopped.
[00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:42.152]  No, he called the police and they called it a hostage situation because she didn't hand the kids right away over to him.
[00:27:43.193 --> 00:27:44.693]  And I don't normally talk about Britney Spears.
[00:27:44.713 --> 00:27:48.275]  I'm talking about her because, you know, you can't help but follow the case.
[00:27:49.091 --> 00:27:52.414]  And they admit, they keep blood testing her when she goes in for probation.
[00:27:52.834 --> 00:27:53.774]  She's not on drugs.
[00:27:53.795 --> 00:27:57.497]  They keep going, she must be on illegal drugs acting crazy.
[00:27:57.517 --> 00:27:59.138]  Well, Brittany was never really into illegal drugs.
[00:27:59.158 --> 00:28:01.100]  She was into alcohol and prescription drugs.
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.222]  And now they've got her all hopped up on psychotropics.
[00:28:05.623 --> 00:28:06.984]  By the way, it isn't my opinion.
[00:28:07.024 --> 00:28:17.611]  If you go read the insert, and they're all online at the drug company websites, for all the serotonin reuptake inhibitors, Lubox, Prozac, all of them, Paxil, there's hundreds of them now.
[00:28:18.032 --> 00:28:18.472]  Over a hundred.
[00:28:19.105 --> 00:28:33.052]  They all say increased suicide, many fold, make you have psychopathic breaks, make you attack people violently, make you have... I mean, you don't normally see women going wild with butcher knives and cutting their baby's arms off or drowning them one after the other.
[00:28:33.072 --> 00:28:37.034]  I mean, even the most wicked person has trouble drowning five kids in a row.
[00:28:38.255 --> 00:28:39.876]  It's when you're on these hallucinogens.
[00:28:41.056 --> 00:28:44.018]  Of course she's whacked out, shaving her head, running around like a lunatic.
[00:28:45.129 --> 00:28:52.331]  I can't tell you how many cops I've talked to who say they pull up at a house and a woman's running around naked cutting themselves or up on top of a house naked cutting themselves.
[00:28:52.351 --> 00:28:53.512]  That seems to be the thing they do.
[00:28:53.892 --> 00:28:58.633]  Or how many young kids are cutting themselves and cops are called in to stop it and they're always on the drugs.
[00:29:02.355 --> 00:29:03.175]  Oh, it doesn't matter.
[00:29:04.115 --> 00:29:06.116]  They've gone from 15% to 20% of the country now being on them.
[00:29:07.532 --> 00:29:10.655]  Three years ago, they passed a new freedom initiative to push all these in the public schools.
[00:29:10.695 --> 00:29:14.798]  Their own internal documents say the plan is to get 50 plus percent on in the next phase.
[00:29:15.359 --> 00:29:17.521]  And they're on chart to do it within the next 10 years.
[00:29:19.122 --> 00:29:19.522]  Oh, man.
[00:29:19.562 --> 00:29:22.485]  And they'll have more shootings, more killings, more suicides.
[00:29:22.505 --> 00:29:24.086]  Their answer will be more drugs.
[00:29:25.067 --> 00:29:27.349]  It's like the HPV shot actually gives you cancer.
[00:29:27.389 --> 00:29:28.330]  That's in their own handout.
[00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:32.854]  And they're going to say cancer virus, that type of cancer went up.
[00:29:32.914 --> 00:29:34.535]  And they're going to say you need more shots.
[00:29:34.695 --> 00:29:35.616]  And it'll go up again and
[00:29:36.653 --> 00:29:37.213]  Heaven help us.
[00:29:37.273 --> 00:29:38.514]  These people don't play games.
[00:29:39.595 --> 00:29:40.756]  They don't play games at all.
[00:29:41.856 --> 00:29:42.497]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:42.517 --> 00:29:42.897]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.622 --> 00:29:52.582]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.023 --> 00:29:54.624]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.564 --> 00:29:58.266]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.483 --> 00:30:03.824]  America is the fattest nation on the planet.
[00:30:03.924 --> 00:30:10.427]  The obesity epidemic kills over 300,000 Americans each and every year, and this number continues to rise at an alarming rate.
[00:30:10.587 --> 00:30:13.688]  With fast food chains everywhere, eating right is not an easy task.
[00:30:13.908 --> 00:30:17.049]  It's time to stop eating those unhealthy meals and fattening snacks.
[00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:19.971]  Assured that you and your family do not become a statistic.
[00:30:20.191 --> 00:30:22.432]  Introducing the Excalibur Dehydrator.

[00:30:25.533 --> 00:30:30.355]  The Excalibur Dehydrator preserves fruits, vegetables, fish, and beef quickly and easily.

[00:32:01.285 --> 00:32:06.930]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:12.195]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[00:32:12.535 --> 00:32:13.036]  We're good to go.
[00:32:39.258 --> 00:32:40.459]  Again, that's AlkaVision.com.
[00:33:04.019 --> 00:33:04.580]  We're good to go.
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:04.800]  I think?
[00:33:27.172 --> 00:33:48.639]  I live back in the woods, you see A woman and the kids and the dogs and me I got a shotgun, a rifle and a four-wheel drive And a country boy can survive A country boy can survive
[00:33:52.626 --> 00:34:20.206]  I can plow a field all day long I can catch catfish from dusk till dawn We make our own whiskey and our own smoke too Ain't too many things these old boys can't do We grow good old tomatoes and homemade wine And country boy can survive
[00:34:27.634 --> 00:34:28.174]  Welcome back.
[00:34:28.214 --> 00:34:30.856]  I'm very, very thankful that you've decided to join us today.
[00:34:30.936 --> 00:34:40.282]  California is on the verge of passing a bill where the government will control your thermostats by remote control.
[00:34:58.140 --> 00:34:58.961]  We're good to go.
[00:35:26.977 --> 00:35:29.079]  Right there, of course, in Jerusalem.
[00:35:31.401 --> 00:35:35.425]  Double agent, Gadon, threatens Bush in neoconstant.
[00:35:35.946 --> 00:35:41.431]  Jewish Zionist, who once called Muslims bloodthirsty terrorists, and who would even go to mosque and beat them up.
[00:35:41.471 --> 00:35:45.875]  This is somebody who actually go out, hates Muslims so much, he goes out and beats them up.
[00:35:48.644 --> 00:35:57.769]  Granddaddy runs the ADL, and then he magically goes from some Hollywood studio and produces these stupid things with this obvious fake beard stuck to his face.
[00:35:58.169 --> 00:35:59.970]  I mean, how much of this do we have to take?
[00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:01.191]  How much fake news?
[00:36:01.631 --> 00:36:02.131]  How much?
[00:36:02.191 --> 00:36:03.072]  I'm so sick of it.
[00:36:03.332 --> 00:36:05.673]  Big story up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:36:07.274 --> 00:36:09.835]  Israel's been caught creating fake Al-Qaeda groups, mainstream news.
[00:36:09.855 --> 00:36:10.695]  We have links to all that.
[00:36:10.936 --> 00:36:12.536]  Get this story Paul Watson did.
[00:36:12.837 --> 00:36:13.937]  Get it out to everybody.
[00:36:13.957 --> 00:36:17.399]  I know there's a big section, Mike Rivero's,
[00:36:18.192 --> 00:36:19.172]  Made on WhatReallyHappened.com.
[00:36:19.212 --> 00:36:20.653]  That's what we got him on today to talk about this.
[00:36:20.913 --> 00:36:23.173]  And we got Bev Harris coming on tomorrow.
[00:36:23.753 --> 00:36:33.316]  She's working on another big story she's going to break here tomorrow, just like we broke Sunday that he was going to be on Jay Leno tonight when we had the spokesman of the campaign on, Jesse Benton, on the Sunday night show.
[00:36:33.776 --> 00:36:36.977]  Well, we're telling you right here, Bev Harris is going to break big news here tomorrow.
[00:36:37.497 --> 00:36:38.817]  But she's already broken a lot of it.
[00:36:38.877 --> 00:36:40.238]  Mike Rivera's vetted out a lot of it.
[00:36:40.278 --> 00:36:41.298]  He's a big computer guy.
[00:36:41.878 --> 00:36:43.378]  And so we're all here to talk about election fraud.
[00:36:43.398 --> 00:36:45.679]  We're going to this Godin situation.
[00:36:46.665 --> 00:37:00.032]  Before we go to Mike Rivera, until the end of this month, that's going to go by before you know it, you can get 5.3 months, 5 plus months free at prisonplanet.tv.

[00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:21.451]  We couldn't do it without you.

[00:37:30.956 --> 00:37:35.759]  Let's say you're a member two years ago and it was decent quality, but kind of medium speed downloads and high peak times.
[00:37:36.039 --> 00:37:36.640]  Go there now.
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:38.901]  That's the same bandwidth you're going to be getting as a member.

[00:38:00.854 --> 00:38:02.414]  These need to be gotten out to people.
[00:38:02.875 --> 00:38:07.516]  And by the way, you're authorized or encouraged to make copies of all of my films for non-profit educational purposes.
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:11.923]  All right, let's now go ahead and go to Mike Rivera.
[00:38:11.943 --> 00:38:12.704]  I'm not going to keep him long.
[00:38:12.724 --> 00:38:13.645]  He's very busy today.
[00:38:14.446 --> 00:38:21.332]  But, Mike, I noticed that you did some of the first analysis of what happened in Iowa.
[00:38:21.352 --> 00:38:24.534]  Some people attacked me for some reason, saying I said there was fraud.
[00:38:24.975 --> 00:38:27.277]  I was just reading Bev Harris and your analysis.
[00:38:28.021 --> 00:38:29.082]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:38:29.102 --> 00:38:31.704]  Vote fraud cannot reverse a landslide.
[00:38:31.724 --> 00:38:33.285]  All it can do is move percentage points...
[00:38:56.708 --> 00:38:59.110]  Just a few back and forth, otherwise it becomes obvious.
[00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:17.522]  And a big part of the campaign for people who are going to be cheating, which unfortunately seems to be a lot of them right now, is they just need to get the election close, like maybe 45% to 55%, and then they use election fraud to kind of shift things just enough to give them the win.
[00:39:17.562 --> 00:39:20.023]  And of course, Ohio is a really good example, looking back at 2006.
[00:39:21.616 --> 00:39:26.837]  Where, you know, Bush was just barely beat Kerry in Ohio.
[00:39:26.917 --> 00:39:30.058]  Now, of course, we realize there was a lot of vote fraud.
[00:39:30.318 --> 00:39:41.201]  When they went to do a recount, the people doing the recount were caught handpicking the ballots so that they'd match the official results in a recount, and they just got sentenced to prison for doing that.
[00:39:41.261 --> 00:39:47.022]  So we know the recount was fraud, and nobody's going to do a fraudulent recount unless the actual election itself
[00:39:47.426 --> 00:39:48.066]  ...was a fraud.
[00:39:48.086 --> 00:39:51.427]  So at this point, it's been settled in a court of law.
[00:39:51.467 --> 00:39:53.568]  The Ohio election in 2006 was fraudulent.
[00:39:53.628 --> 00:39:56.348]  The wrong person won.
[00:39:56.708 --> 00:40:00.949]  Yeah, the wrong person won, and hence... Now let's be clear here.
[00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:07.211]  A lot of Republican mainline fake conservative followers, they look at elections and they decide who they...
[00:40:07.907 --> 00:40:12.571]  I want to make something clear, because I hear the jokes about how we're conspiracy terrorists by Neil Bortz and others.
[00:40:12.591 --> 00:40:12.872]  We don't...
[00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:25.572]  I mean, if Bush would have really won, we would have said it.
[00:40:25.993 --> 00:40:28.516]  Or if Kerry would have really lost, we would have said it.
[00:40:28.816 --> 00:40:30.758]  We don't come to this with an axe to grind.
[00:40:31.058 --> 00:40:35.443]  We've had people at the election companies go public saying they were hired for fraud, the engineers.
[00:40:35.764 --> 00:40:40.609]  We've had vice presidents caught being computer crimes specialists with felony convictions.
[00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:42.511]  They've been caught red-handed.
[00:40:43.012 --> 00:40:44.834]  They just caught one of the top pollsters.
[00:40:45.775 --> 00:40:48.737]  Running around staging focus groups in New Hampshire.
[00:40:49.078 --> 00:40:50.379]  That's big news today.
[00:40:50.759 --> 00:40:52.100]  And you just heard Mike Rivero.
[00:40:52.421 --> 00:40:56.464]  Convictions in Ohio backing up.
[00:40:56.524 --> 00:40:57.986]  These are convictions.
[00:40:58.046 --> 00:41:00.288]  These are people pleading guilty.
[00:41:00.628 --> 00:41:02.430]  So that's a key point you just made.
[00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:02.910]  Go ahead, Mike.
[00:41:03.591 --> 00:41:10.577]  Yeah, and besides, remember, we're not talking about a criminal court here where we have to prove the fraud beyond a reasonable doubt.
[00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:14.672]  This is the government claiming authority over us based on the elections.
[00:41:14.732 --> 00:41:23.076]  The burden of proof is on them to prove the elections by which they claim authority and power over us are honest and accurate and honest.
[00:41:23.416 --> 00:41:32.381]  And if they can't prove that then there's no reason why we the people should be listening to what they tell us to do or paying their bills for these ruinous wars that
[00:41:34.162 --> 00:41:52.297]  Let's specifically, though, Mike, in the time we've got with you, get into the findings, the evidence of fraud in Ohio, like the Democrats coming in early with their ballots, but then Republicans until after midnight saying they were going to be releasing the numbers in real time, not doing it, exit polls not matching up.
[00:41:53.458 --> 00:42:00.284]  Yeah, all of those things and more, and moving more to the current situation, looking back here at Iowa last week,
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:03.341]  And Beth Harris, we were being flooded.
[00:42:03.901 --> 00:42:06.962]  Literally, we were getting more information in than we knew what to do with.
[00:42:07.602 --> 00:42:16.285]  And I got tons of email from people who claimed they were in the actual caucuses, and they were saying our ward voted for Ron Paul, but it was reported something else.
[00:42:16.385 --> 00:42:25.528]  I know that one of Beth Harris' situations is rather than counting the caucus results in public with everybody watching the way it was supposed to be, it all went into a back room.
[00:42:26.027 --> 00:42:32.049]  You know, and they said, well, you know, counting from across the county, this is what we got, and nobody could really follow it all the way through.
[00:42:32.149 --> 00:42:33.129]  Yeah, that's admitted.
[00:42:33.149 --> 00:42:33.569]  That's admitted.
[00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:37.710]  I mean, and then we're just told to shut up and go along with the official story, Mike.
[00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:39.290]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:42:39.310 --> 00:42:43.411]  And then, of course, all these numbers go into, I know they changed their own voters' news service.
[00:42:43.431 --> 00:42:47.513]  I think it's real-time election services or something like that.
[00:42:48.053 --> 00:42:53.054]  But, again, it's the same old bunch of crooks who basically take the numbers in and they say, this is who your new leader is.
[00:42:53.436 --> 00:42:54.496]  And just accept it.
[00:42:54.997 --> 00:42:56.317]  And, you know, it's kind of interesting.
[00:42:56.357 --> 00:43:11.101]  I just found an article I just put up where somebody said, you know, in the wake of all five of Ohio's electronic voting systems being decertified for use because they're so easy to rig, somebody just said, why not use the state's lottery system?
[00:43:11.141 --> 00:43:12.762]  Because that's an optical card reader.
[00:43:13.062 --> 00:43:15.203]  It's in every retail establishment.
[00:43:15.503 --> 00:43:18.924]  The people of Ohio trust it with millions of dollars of their betting money.
[00:43:20.094 --> 00:43:22.074]  And why not just use that to run the election?
[00:43:22.094 --> 00:43:23.855]  Because apparently that can't be rigged.
[00:43:25.455 --> 00:43:26.635]  That's amazing, Mike.
[00:43:26.855 --> 00:43:32.797]  Looking forward into New Hampshire, what do you see happening there?
[00:43:32.817 --> 00:43:34.797]  A little bit harder to rig, but they can still play games.
[00:43:35.697 --> 00:43:37.377]  Oh, they can definitely play games.
[00:43:37.758 --> 00:43:40.858]  I mean, ballot box stuffing goes way back before the electronics.
[00:43:40.938 --> 00:43:45.099]  It's just the electronics make it a lot easier to do and a lot more difficult to detect.
[00:43:45.886 --> 00:43:56.917]  And, you know, ultimately it's going to be in the hands of the people to stop this and bring about fair elections because the government is never going to work for honest elections because they're all the beneficiaries of the current system.
[00:43:57.978 --> 00:44:02.982]  You know, they're perfectly happy to let it go on where they don't have to worry about what the voters think anymore.
[00:44:03.022 --> 00:44:05.645]  They just have to worry about the people giving them money want.
[00:44:05.973 --> 00:44:13.562]  And that's why, you know, this last couple of years, we've seen Congress is just completely disinterested in whether the American people want these wars or not.
[00:44:13.602 --> 00:44:22.472]  Well, I understand why the campaign wants to take the high road and not say there's election fraud because the media will spin it and say they're being, you know, sour pusses and, you know, claiming they've been cheated.
[00:44:22.492 --> 00:44:23.333]  Sour grapes and stuff.
[00:44:24.154 --> 00:44:24.754]  Exactly.
[00:44:24.854 --> 00:44:26.515]  But this is going on.
[00:44:26.555 --> 00:44:28.677]  There's evidence of this happening.
[00:44:28.697 --> 00:44:29.678]  They've been caught.
[00:44:29.718 --> 00:44:30.719]  They've been convicted.
[00:44:31.099 --> 00:44:33.060]  We know that it's going on.
[00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:37.844]  They have federal court rulings saying it doesn't matter if 300 million people have been disenfranchised.
[00:44:38.204 --> 00:44:41.247]  No one can look under the hood of these secret machines.
[00:44:42.007 --> 00:44:45.810]  And even when they get decertified, they still didn't get recertified the last minute.
[00:44:46.211 --> 00:44:47.872]  What do you see happening in New Hampshire?
[00:44:47.892 --> 00:44:48.472]  I mean, I agree.
[00:44:48.532 --> 00:44:51.074]  Ron Paul's going to win New Hampshire in reality.
[00:44:51.214 --> 00:44:53.276]  And by the way, Ted Anderson, I just got the new video in.
[00:44:53.316 --> 00:45:04.465]  It's up on prisonplanet.com and truthnews.us of our airplane taking off over New Hampshire over the Fox News debate yesterday afternoon with Ron Paul Revolution.
[00:45:04.485 --> 00:45:07.807]  So good job, listeners, for that at the ronpaulaircorps.com.
[00:45:08.068 --> 00:45:09.909]  What do you see happening in New Hampshire?
[00:45:10.566 --> 00:45:15.827]  Well, I think Ron Paul's going to have a very strong showing, and the reason is, you have to remember, I'm originally a New Hampshire man myself.
[00:45:15.927 --> 00:45:19.768]  I grew up in the middle of New Hampshire farming country, 4-H, the whole thing.
[00:45:20.168 --> 00:45:24.929]  And one thing you're going to find throughout New England and in New Hampshire is a strong sense of fair play.
[00:45:25.009 --> 00:45:32.151]  And right now, the people I'm talking to in New Hampshire are livid at the way Fox News excluded Ron Paul from the debates.
[00:45:32.531 --> 00:45:37.812]  They are absolutely livid that the mainstream media is trying to tell them who they're supposed to vote for.
[00:45:38.605 --> 00:45:47.234]  And just out of that sense of fair play, they're taking a good long look at Ron Paul and saying, what is over here that the mainstream media and the political establishment are so afraid of?
[00:45:47.314 --> 00:45:49.597]  But even Jay Leno's got him coming on tonight.
[00:45:49.677 --> 00:45:51.599]  I mean, didn't Fox know this was going to backfire?
[00:45:51.899 --> 00:45:53.361]  Or is it just imperial hubris?
[00:45:54.122 --> 00:46:00.810]  I think it's imperial hubris because we're still seeing the government trying these same old lame tricks to kick off a war.
[00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:03.713]  They tried to lie about nuclear weapons twice in a row.
[00:46:04.033 --> 00:46:14.966]  Now they've got that, I'm searching for an FCC acceptable word, stunt that they just pulled in the Strait of Hormuz of trying to say that the Iranian boats were threatening American warships.
[00:46:15.453 --> 00:46:19.514]  I am insulted that they think the American people are dumb enough to fall for this.
[00:46:19.534 --> 00:46:21.155]  Oh, yeah, that's the latest news.
[00:46:21.195 --> 00:46:22.515]  That's in my stack, too.
[00:46:23.336 --> 00:46:26.117]  That's up on whatreallyhappened.com and prisonplanet.com.
[00:46:26.497 --> 00:46:34.059]  I mean, we've got our ships right up there up against their ships, knowing there's going to be something happen sooner or later.
[00:46:34.319 --> 00:46:35.460]  This is very suspect.
[00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:38.121]  Oh, it's Gulf of Tonkin all over again.
[00:46:38.461 --> 00:46:41.922]  And the really weird part is they really think this is going to work.
[00:46:42.423 --> 00:46:49.785]  They really believed lying about Iran's nuclear weapons, excuse me, nuclear weapons, was going to fool us a second time in a row.
[00:46:50.085 --> 00:46:54.006]  They think that a repeat of the Gulf of Tonkin is going to work a second time in a row.
[00:46:54.246 --> 00:46:54.727]  The U.S.
[00:46:54.767 --> 00:46:59.168]  government really does have a very low opinion of the intelligence of the average American citizen.
[00:47:00.648 --> 00:47:01.069]  I agree.
[00:47:01.109 --> 00:47:04.369]  What do you see, I mean, flesh more of it out, what do you see happening in New Hampshire?
[00:47:04.409 --> 00:47:05.250]  What can we do to stop it?
[00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:08.411]  I think, you know...
[00:47:09.778 --> 00:47:11.179]  Boy, that's a real hard one to say.
[00:47:11.239 --> 00:47:13.001]  I think Ron Paul is going to do very well.
[00:47:13.422 --> 00:47:18.166]  I think it's going to continue to confound the polling.
[00:47:18.186 --> 00:47:31.359]  And I think one of the reasons why Fox is taking so much heat is they're trying to basically say, our own polls are more accurate than the Iowa caucuses, where the Iowa caucuses had Ron Paul beating Rudy Giuliani by almost two to one.
[00:47:31.849 --> 00:47:34.330]  And yet Fox is saying, well, he's still not a real candidate.
[00:47:34.650 --> 00:47:37.072]  We have decided for you who the real candidates would be.
[00:47:37.292 --> 00:47:42.975]  That's going to anger a lot of people, and just how much of a factor that anger will be is kind of hard to state.
[00:47:43.215 --> 00:47:57.602]  But I think that Ron Paul is going to do a lot better in New Hampshire than anybody is saying, and we're going to see the mainstream media with a little bit more egg on their face trying to explain away why they've been paying no attention to Ron Paul when obviously he's got this incredible grassroots support.
[00:47:58.286 --> 00:48:09.033]  Mike Rivero, throughout history, in the classic cases of Caligula or Montezuma, and there's all these examples across the planet, of elites going crazy.
[00:48:09.313 --> 00:48:17.399]  They have their experts, they have their think tanks, they have their different commanders over different divisions and stratas of the global economy and the geopolitical system.
[00:48:18.079 --> 00:48:21.280]  But at the same time, we see the elites still making mistakes going crazy.
[00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:36.103]  All these Republican memos and Republican strategists and senators and former senators and Republican Party chairmen of states and syndicated columnists saying 9-11 was wonderful, we need another one, get ready, what we need is another terror attack.
[00:48:36.143 --> 00:48:38.283]  Terror attacks sure are good.
[00:48:38.643 --> 00:48:43.024]  And now Fox blocking Ron Paul and torture is good.
[00:48:43.364 --> 00:48:46.985]  I mean, it seems like these guys are pretty much just completely insane.
[00:48:47.995 --> 00:48:50.217]  Well, what it is, is they're true believers.
[00:48:50.277 --> 00:49:02.107]  And we have seen this in our nation's history many, many times before where you get a clique of people together, some of whom are sociopathic and absolutely do not see or feel the consequences of their actions in other people.
[00:49:02.509 --> 00:49:09.674]  But they get together and they think, we know what's best for the country, and we're going to move the country into this great new period of glorious growth.
[00:49:10.054 --> 00:49:21.942]  And in the current case, all of this goes back to that project for the new American century, which basically had an agenda of, we're the world's only remaining superpower, let's act like one, and the world will be ours for the next hundred years.
[00:49:22.442 --> 00:49:28.066]  And it's the same kind of global domination crap
[00:49:28.433 --> 00:49:33.716]  That we keep hearing from other would-be dictators, going all the way back to Alexander the Great.
[00:49:34.016 --> 00:49:45.061]  You know, every hundred years or so, we seem cursed by somebody who thinks that they can wind up owning it all, and that once they do, everything is just going to be so much better, because they know how to run the world better than anybody else.
[00:49:45.081 --> 00:49:47.162]  But owning it all sounds like a complete nightmare.
[00:49:48.303 --> 00:49:54.906]  Well, it is, because the reason I'm against globalism is, what happens if you have a global government and it falls into the hands of another Hitler?
[00:49:55.256 --> 00:50:01.039]  And there's nobody else out there able to muster opposition to stop him from reshaping the human race.
[00:50:01.099 --> 00:50:03.100]  I mean, we've already heard about the New World Order.
[00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:09.363]  One of their goals is to depopulate the planet, and they get to choose who is depopulated.
[00:50:09.443 --> 00:50:19.387]  Oh, by the way, I just found out that Michael Crichton wrote a whole book about that, and then in the index says that the book's basically about reality, and it sounds like Endgame.
[00:50:19.507 --> 00:50:22.869]  Wow, I didn't know Michael Crichton knew about all this, Mike.
[00:50:23.553 --> 00:50:25.054]  Oh, yeah, he is so plugged in.
[00:50:25.074 --> 00:50:31.838]  He lives out here on Kauai, and he is so plugged into all this stuff, and that's why his book, State of Fear, was such an absolute condom.
[00:50:31.858 --> 00:50:32.358]  No, that's it.
[00:50:32.779 --> 00:50:34.059]  Yeah, that's it, State of Fear, yeah.
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:48.088]  Yeah, yeah, and it's a wonderful book, and it's based on very real science, and yeah, absolutely, it was that whole idea that we're going to reshape the world in the way that we think it should be, because we know better than anybody else.
[00:50:48.562 --> 00:50:53.325]  And it seems to come up, we seem to get these sociopaths who are attracted to power.
[00:50:53.966 --> 00:50:58.669]  In fact, if there's one thing bad about power, it's that it always attracts the people who shouldn't have it.
[00:50:58.689 --> 00:50:59.569]  Do one more segment.
[00:50:59.590 --> 00:51:00.970]  I want to talk about the Mossad agent.
[00:51:02.351 --> 00:51:03.752]  It is a big idea.
[00:51:03.772 --> 00:51:05.874]  A new world order.
[00:51:06.594 --> 00:51:10.777]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful government.
[00:51:10.977 --> 00:51:13.239]  It's known as the Builderberg.
[00:51:14.319 --> 00:51:16.481]  Both their objectives being world domination...
[00:51:17.102 --> 00:51:17.603]  We're good to go.
[00:51:30.603 --> 00:51:35.586]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:51:36.067 --> 00:51:39.549]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:51:39.929 --> 00:51:42.431]  Bill Vargas is making great progress toward the world government.
[00:51:42.491 --> 00:51:43.652]  Most people have no idea.
[00:51:43.672 --> 00:51:44.432]  They're not after money.
[00:51:44.452 --> 00:51:45.513]  They have all the money they need.
[00:51:45.693 --> 00:51:46.494]  They're after power.
[00:51:46.694 --> 00:51:47.734]  That's what they're after.

[00:51:59.382 --> 00:52:00.403]  You have been warned.
[00:52:01.764 --> 00:52:03.605]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:52:03.745 --> 00:52:10.449]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:52:10.709 --> 00:52:18.893]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:52:19.113 --> 00:52:24.877]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:52:24.897 --> 00:52:26.778]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:52:26.858 --> 00:52:28.959]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:52:29.139 --> 00:52:33.424]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:52:33.564 --> 00:52:35.707]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.

[00:53:01.258 --> 00:53:04.699]  Attention, this is Jack Blood with an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:07.040]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.661]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[00:53:09.922 --> 00:53:14.283]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there is a very real chance you will now be able to do it.
[00:53:14.303 --> 00:53:14.984]  Here's why.
[00:53:15.404 --> 00:53:21.326]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[00:53:21.566 --> 00:53:27.569]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating.
[00:53:27.809 --> 00:53:28.729]  But they're not cheating.
[00:53:28.969 --> 00:53:29.810]  We're good to go.
[00:54:10.277 --> 00:54:13.319]  Monday through Friday, from 11 a.m.
[00:54:13.359 --> 00:54:14.220]  until 2 p.m.
[00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:16.021]  Central Standard Time, we're live.
[00:54:17.082 --> 00:54:17.942]  Barry Goldwater Jr.
[00:54:17.982 --> 00:54:19.263]  is coming up in the third hour.
[00:54:19.283 --> 00:54:27.309]  Got some breaking in-studio news on Trans-Texas Corridor and Napa Superhighway maps that haven't seen a lot of day, that aren't public yet.
[00:54:28.234 --> 00:54:29.556]  That's coming up right here.
[00:54:33.861 --> 00:54:35.263]  On the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:35.882 --> 00:54:42.664]  Going back to the man who runs WhatReallyHappened.com, Mike, double agent Gadon threatens Bush in Neocon Stunt.
[00:54:43.024 --> 00:54:45.064]  I was watching Fox and CNN last night.
[00:54:45.084 --> 00:54:47.725]  It was like Bush with incredible daring.
[00:54:48.505 --> 00:54:54.026]  With all these graphics made and these huge intros, goes the Middle East to face down the Al-Qaeda leader.
[00:54:54.246 --> 00:55:00.448]  So they gave us an Al-Qaeda that talks in our language, and they don't care if he's a street thug who openly would go and beat up Muslims at mosques.
[00:55:00.965 --> 00:55:01.686]  Well, it is very, very obvious.
[00:55:01.766 --> 00:55:05.148]  And again, in the days before the Internet and alternative media...
[00:55:25.703 --> 00:55:31.826]  They would have gotten away with it, because even those people who doubted it would have had no way to spread their doubts.
[00:55:31.906 --> 00:55:47.413]  I mean, looking back now at some of the cover-ups we've seen in the past, well, the JFK assassination, the RFK assassination, looking back at them, it's patently obvious what complete hoaxes they were.
[00:55:47.513 --> 00:55:52.735]  Even Pakistan can't get away with putting out the story that Budo wasn't shot.
[00:55:53.331 --> 00:55:54.692]  Yeah, with the sunroof thing.
[00:55:54.712 --> 00:55:55.773]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:55:55.793 --> 00:56:06.299]  And I think the biggest hope for the world right now is that the leaders of the world are still, for the most part, these old Cold War fossils who just don't get it.
[00:56:06.639 --> 00:56:11.442]  That the model for how information flows through society has changed forever.
[00:56:11.582 --> 00:56:14.584]  It is no longer from the leaders to the media to the people.
[00:56:15.024 --> 00:56:16.464]  It's from the people to the people.
[00:56:16.604 --> 00:56:19.225]  But we know that the CIA with DARPA created the web.
[00:56:19.265 --> 00:56:20.525]  We know MIT's on top of that.
[00:56:20.545 --> 00:56:23.186]  We know their think tanks are telling them they're in trouble.
[00:56:23.246 --> 00:56:27.647]  Congress openly has hearings and says that, quote, the alternative media is taking over.
[00:56:27.667 --> 00:56:28.587]  They're all with al-Qaeda.
[00:56:28.607 --> 00:56:29.067]  They're evil.
[00:56:29.307 --> 00:56:30.787]  You know, putting out that official spin.
[00:56:31.167 --> 00:56:39.689]  But it does appear that the higher-ups of the New World Order just are still at the helm and aren't even listening to their minions, which is a good thing, isn't it, Mike?
[00:56:40.322 --> 00:56:49.966]  Yeah, it absolutely is, because they're continuing to make these mistakes, and one of the things we have around here is the fastest way to bring down a dictator is to force them to act like one where everybody can see it.
[00:56:50.386 --> 00:56:59.270]  And we're beginning to see that right now, where our own government is being forced to, like, now they're setting up this thing about, what is it they call it, sudden jihad syndrome.
[00:56:59.530 --> 00:57:03.472]  They're trying to come up with fancy names to explain the fact that Americans are getting angry.
[00:57:03.911 --> 00:57:14.815]  And they've just about been fed up with all of this nonsense, and all it's going to take is one more obviously stolen election for people to seriously start thinking about alternative courses of action.
[00:57:14.895 --> 00:57:20.097]  And that just makes it more obvious when the news says, if you don't agree with the war, you're secretly an al-Qaeda.
[00:57:21.018 --> 00:57:22.018]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:57:22.058 --> 00:57:24.659]  It's reached just utterly absurd levels.
[00:57:24.799 --> 00:57:29.001]  And I guess buried in the middle of it, maybe they don't see how absurd it looks to the rest of the world,
[00:57:29.446 --> 00:57:30.527]  And the rest of America.
[00:57:30.827 --> 00:57:43.693]  And again, it's amazing that they think these lies are going to work twice in a row, like trying to go into Iran for nuclear bombs after we've already seen that Iraq didn't have the ones that we were told they had.
[00:57:43.773 --> 00:57:46.595]  It's almost like the people at the very top of our government
[00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:51.503]  Are completely cut off from what we're thinking out there in the U.S.
[00:57:51.783 --> 00:57:58.627]  And Mike, just two years ago, Adam Gadon, if you went to ABC News, only a third of the Post would say he's CIA, he's Messiah.
[00:57:58.967 --> 00:58:01.068]  Now you go there, every Post says it.
[00:58:01.368 --> 00:58:09.032]  I mean, it looks like the government and the system and the corporates that own it have just blown all credibility even faster than I thought.
[00:58:09.072 --> 00:58:10.173]  It's like they're bleeding out.
[00:58:11.081 --> 00:58:13.482]  They absolutely are, and they don't know what else to do.
[00:58:13.522 --> 00:58:17.484]  So they keep on doing what used to work, and they don't understand.
[00:58:17.504 --> 00:58:19.045]  There's really only one course of action.
[00:58:19.485 --> 00:58:20.566]  There's one course of action.
[00:58:20.826 --> 00:58:21.806]  Start telling the truth.
[00:58:22.106 --> 00:58:23.427]  Start being honest with the people.
[00:58:23.807 --> 00:58:26.328]  Anything else is just not going to work anymore.
[00:58:26.448 --> 00:58:27.049]  It can't.
[00:58:27.409 --> 00:58:29.490]  Not in the age of the Internet and alternative media.
[00:58:29.530 --> 00:58:31.291]  Well, I think they're going to stage big events, Mike.
[00:58:31.331 --> 00:58:31.791]  What do you think?
[00:58:32.598 --> 00:58:34.879]  I would agree that it's probably under consideration right now.
[00:58:35.159 --> 00:58:37.120]  Mike Rivero, thanks for spending time with us.
[00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:38.180]  You got it.
[00:58:38.220 --> 00:58:38.920]  Talk to you soon.
[00:58:39.121 --> 00:58:40.801]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:41.742 --> 00:58:45.403]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:46.523 --> 00:58:48.884]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:52.025 --> 00:58:52.285]  Now.
[00:58:58.188 --> 00:58:58.788]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.498 --> 00:59:00.578]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.259 --> 00:59:02.379]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:03.019 --> 00:59:03.860]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:05.500]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.161 --> 00:59:09.842]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.342 --> 00:59:14.424]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:26.668 --> 00:59:33.139]  It is the battle for the republic, the battle for western civilization, the battle for liberty on a planetary scale.
[00:59:33.981 --> 00:59:35.563]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:59:35.583 --> 00:59:36.986]  We've got two hours left.
[00:59:37.246 --> 00:59:38.048]  Stuart Nelson.
[00:59:39.013 --> 00:59:39.954]  We're good to go.
[01:00:05.897 --> 01:00:24.486]  And he got some of the plat maps, because he stayed in touch with some of the folks in Waco, and we found out Trans-Texas Corridor, Napa Superhighway, one of them goes right over Mount Carmel where the Davidians, where that massacre took place, and right over the little memorial church, nothing little about it, it seats 300 plus, comfortably.
[01:00:24.506 --> 01:00:29.208]  I wanted to have the little chapel that turned into something big when the volunteers got control of it.
[01:00:30.309 --> 01:00:30.609]  But...
[01:00:31.937 --> 01:00:42.868]  He's going to be in the studio in 30 minutes, and we're going to shoot video of these maps and these documents, and then we're going to put a presentation together for you in the next week that will be up on the web at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:00:42.908 --> 01:00:44.790]  I mean, these are internal plats.
[01:00:45.471 --> 01:00:50.256]  These are the internal maps for the Napa Superhighway Trans-Texas Corridor.
[01:00:50.296 --> 01:00:54.260]  And by the way, since they discovered that Stewart got these six months ago,
[01:00:56.089 --> 01:00:58.290]  They have now will not release these to anybody.
[01:00:58.330 --> 01:00:59.051]  They've tried to go back.
[01:00:59.111 --> 01:01:01.473]  Others have tried to go back and get copies of these.
[01:01:01.493 --> 01:01:02.434]  And, I mean, these are big.
[01:01:02.454 --> 01:01:03.555]  These are big work maps.
[01:01:04.035 --> 01:01:06.557]  These are the actual maps for the Napa Superhighway.
[01:01:07.297 --> 01:01:07.438]  And...
[01:01:08.931 --> 01:01:20.775]  This was all because some of the Davidians that still live out there, Charlie Pace and others, were trying to just get maps of the property and going downtown there in Waco, working on different things with property taxes.
[01:01:20.815 --> 01:01:21.895]  And then they said, oh, don't worry.
[01:01:22.375 --> 01:01:23.855]  We're just taking your property soon.
[01:01:23.875 --> 01:01:25.916]  There's going to be the Napa Superhighway going through it.
[01:01:25.936 --> 01:01:27.156]  And they gave them the maps.
[01:01:27.196 --> 01:01:29.497]  I mean, that's what a small world this is.
[01:01:30.137 --> 01:01:32.058]  Just like three weeks ago, I got mailed.
[01:01:33.001 --> 01:01:46.376]  The North American Union NAU official cataloging system where I'm supposed to sign on my employees and then no longer have a federal or state ID.
[01:01:46.416 --> 01:01:49.640]  It's now an NAU or North American ID.
[01:01:50.402 --> 01:01:52.344]  Or my dad showed up this morning to the office.
[01:01:52.944 --> 01:02:01.690]  We've got a family ranch and farm out in East Texas with hundreds of questions saying by law we've got to answer it, saying we've got to sign on to a contract waiving all our rights.
[01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:03.352]  And most farmers and ranchers are signing it.
[01:02:03.892 --> 01:02:04.873]  Just waiving all rights.
[01:02:05.193 --> 01:02:06.694]  It's basically a probation form.
[01:02:06.994 --> 01:02:07.955]  You just sign yourself.
[01:02:07.975 --> 01:02:12.598]  Just like this report I've got over here where they say, hey, we're going to breathalyze all students now.
[01:02:12.979 --> 01:02:13.579]  It's the law.
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:15.881]  And then you read later there is no law.
[01:02:15.901 --> 01:02:17.522]  They just order you to sign a form.
[01:02:19.005 --> 01:02:21.967]  See, I mean, it's just the government has gone criminal.
[01:02:22.528 --> 01:02:23.429]  It's gone rogue.
[01:02:23.469 --> 01:02:31.195]  The only thing holding it back is there's still good cops, there's still good teachers, there's still good firemen and women, there are still good people in government.
[01:02:31.255 --> 01:02:39.821]  I'm not saying you're all criminals, but the system, the people that run it and set up how it's implemented and administered are criminal.
[01:02:40.822 --> 01:02:42.303]  And they say, well, no, we're not criminal.
[01:02:42.363 --> 01:02:43.884]  Mike makes right.
[01:02:44.225 --> 01:02:47.107]  We're in positions of power, so we rule over you.
[01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:50.341]  What do you think on the eve of the New Hampshire primaries?
[01:02:50.361 --> 01:02:51.082]  What do you think is going to happen?
[01:02:51.102 --> 01:02:54.083]  What do you think about Ron Paul being censored and blowing up in Fox News' face?
[01:02:54.123 --> 01:02:56.764]  He's going to be on for two segments on Jay Leno tonight.
[01:02:57.405 --> 01:03:02.728]  What do you think about everything that's happening, everything that's developing, everything that's unfolding?
[01:03:02.748 --> 01:03:10.992]  You know, last time he met Tom Cruise and some other movie stars backstage and Ron Paul didn't even know who they were, but he was a little nervous on Jay Leno.
[01:03:11.012 --> 01:03:12.072]  He's such a humble guy.
[01:03:12.753 --> 01:03:17.095]  Ron needs to get fired up and focused, as I know he can do, like when he's calm here.
[01:03:17.839 --> 01:03:20.641]  And he's to get on that show tonight and kick butt.
[01:03:21.161 --> 01:03:22.402]  And tell folks, vote for me.
[01:03:22.542 --> 01:03:23.323]  I've been censored.
[01:03:24.323 --> 01:03:25.324]  I'm the man for the job.
[01:03:25.364 --> 01:03:26.325]  He's too humble.
[01:03:26.665 --> 01:03:32.909]  Humble attracts people, but at the same time, I think it's time for some fire-breathing by Ron Paul, our champions.
[01:03:33.250 --> 01:03:40.414]  By the way, we have his good personal friend and very Goldwater, Senator Goldwater's son, who was a congressman in his own right, coming up in the next hour as well.
[01:03:41.095 --> 01:03:44.217]  We'll take some of your phone calls before Stuart Nelson's in the studio with us at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:03:47.737 --> 01:03:52.781]  PrisonPlanet.com and RonPaulWarroom.com are the websites.

[01:04:53.849 --> 01:04:54.329]  Hi, Ken.
[01:04:54.369 --> 01:04:55.150]  It's Judy again.
[01:04:55.170 --> 01:04:59.691]  I just wanted to call you back and let you know how thankful Mike and I are for your working with us.
[01:04:59.831 --> 01:05:02.992]  You know the sun oven we ordered from you on KenSolar.com?
[01:05:03.212 --> 01:05:05.093]  It cooks all of our food and then some.
[01:05:05.353 --> 01:05:07.434]  Plus, we just sold the old gas barbecue.
[01:05:07.614 --> 01:05:13.736]  Also, the solar power generator reduced our electric bill just like you said it would, and it's powering my whole studio right now.
[01:05:13.936 --> 01:05:19.218]  We don't have to worry about our food going bad or surviving the outages anymore, either of which is huge.
[01:05:19.478 --> 01:05:22.340]  Well, Ken, I'll cut this one short for now, and thanks again.
[01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:23.400]  Go, Ken Solar!
[01:05:24.702 --> 01:05:26.223]  Get the best of both worlds.

[01:05:47.998 --> 01:05:52.381]  Order your solar power generator from Ken's website at KenSolar.com.
[01:05:54.119 --> 01:05:55.520]  It is a big idea.
[01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:57.641]  A new world order.
[01:05:58.361 --> 01:06:03.543]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:06:03.583 --> 01:06:05.384]  It's known as the Builderberg Group.
[01:06:06.064 --> 01:06:08.305]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:06:08.866 --> 01:06:11.307]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:06:12.027 --> 01:06:19.370]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:06:22.375 --> 01:06:27.379]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:06:27.839 --> 01:06:31.302]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:06:31.702 --> 01:06:34.204]  Don't forget to make great progress for the world government.
[01:06:34.264 --> 01:06:35.425]  Most people have no idea.
[01:06:35.445 --> 01:06:36.185]  They're not after money.
[01:06:36.205 --> 01:06:37.286]  They have all the money they need.
[01:06:37.506 --> 01:06:38.267]  They're after power.
[01:06:38.487 --> 01:06:39.348]  That's what happens.
[01:06:39.628 --> 01:06:47.854]  Order Endgame on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:06:48.034 --> 01:06:48.474]  Endgame.
[01:06:48.534 --> 01:06:50.656]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:06:51.096 --> 01:06:52.316]  You have been warned.
[01:06:53.717 --> 01:06:56.358]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:56.918 --> 01:06:59.698]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:19.898 --> 01:07:23.800]  Double agent Gadon threatens Bush and neocons stunt.
[01:07:25.141 --> 01:07:27.502]  Now I want to make clear, we're not even bashing Israel here.
[01:07:27.522 --> 01:07:32.705]  A lot of folks want to say Israel is the source of all evil, the fount of all wickedness.
[01:07:33.125 --> 01:07:39.548]  Not only is that a disservice to Jewish Americans and Jews around the world, but it's a disservice to those of us that really want to fight evil.
[01:07:39.988 --> 01:07:41.489]  Evil is in all humans.
[01:07:41.709 --> 01:07:43.670]  Evil is in all of us, including myself.
[01:07:44.191 --> 01:07:47.312]  Every day I have to fight to not do bad things and not do wrong things.
[01:07:47.772 --> 01:07:48.853]  I just do it instinctively.
[01:07:49.625 --> 01:07:51.046]  I instinctively am more aggressive.
[01:07:51.106 --> 01:07:54.368]  I instinctively say bad things, hear horrible things come out of my mouth.
[01:07:55.649 --> 01:07:56.950]  I instinctively want to win.
[01:07:57.590 --> 01:08:00.012]  And I have to always remember to be a moral person.
[01:08:00.632 --> 01:08:03.774]  So when I get up here and talk about Israel being corrupt and wicked, it is true.
[01:08:04.274 --> 01:08:06.395]  It is run by absolute murderers and criminals.
[01:08:06.816 --> 01:08:07.936]  But so is our government.
[01:08:07.996 --> 01:08:09.037]  So is the German government.
[01:08:09.077 --> 01:08:10.098]  So is the Russian government.
[01:08:10.478 --> 01:08:11.679]  So is the Japanese government.
[01:08:11.719 --> 01:08:12.980]  It's the nature of power.
[01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:15.181]  So we do ourselves a disservice...
[01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:19.012]  When we... I mean, it's corruption everywhere.
[01:08:19.052 --> 01:08:20.473]  We've got to stop that.
[01:08:21.513 --> 01:08:25.335]  And it's always been a disservice by one group saying they're good and the other group saying they're bad.
[01:08:25.655 --> 01:08:34.260]  That said, Israel has been caught attacking the USS Liberty to blame it on their political enemies.
[01:08:35.281 --> 01:08:42.164]  That's now been declassified and the NSA communiques have been released and Israeli pilots have admitted it publicly and it's done.
[01:08:42.505 --> 01:08:43.045]  Debate over.
[01:08:43.105 --> 01:08:44.826]  Israel attacked the ship to try to blame it on Egypt.
[01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:50.192]  And our government was involved and ordered the planes to stand down and tried to hold back while Israel sunk it.
[01:08:50.392 --> 01:08:50.732]  Period.
[01:08:51.072 --> 01:08:51.392]  Period.
[01:08:52.693 --> 01:08:53.033]  Period.
[01:08:53.833 --> 01:08:55.534]  So that's what happened in 1967.
[01:08:55.634 --> 01:08:59.956]  Israel's been caught in 2002 setting up fake al-Qaeda groups and staging bombings.
[01:09:00.036 --> 01:09:03.357]  Jerusalem Post, Haratz, UPI, AP, Reuters, AFP.
[01:09:06.145 --> 01:09:07.686]  And Israel does this stuff continually.
[01:09:07.726 --> 01:09:10.726]  Now, with this Adam Gadon, I don't know who's handling Adam Gadon.
[01:09:11.207 --> 01:09:17.828]  I don't know if it's Mossad, CIA, they're basically indistinguishable from each other, but governments do do this, and they do it all the time.
[01:09:19.489 --> 01:09:23.190]  Double agent Gadon threatens Bush in neocon stunt.
[01:09:24.136 --> 01:09:31.078]  Jewish Zionists who once called Muslims bloodthirsty terrorists helped Giuliani flagging numbers before New Hampshire primary.
[01:09:31.619 --> 01:09:44.223]  Adam Perlman, the Jewish Mossad agent who once wrote stinging essays condemning Muslims as bloodthirsty terrorists, has once again popped up as an Al-Qaeda spokesman to boost the neocons' imperial agenda by threatening George Bush on the eve of a trip to the Middle East.
[01:09:44.770 --> 01:09:55.035]  In a new videotape, Perlman, now calling himself Adam Gadon, states that occupied territories are awaiting their first visit by the crusader Bush, and the Mujahideen are waiting for him, reports ABC News.
[01:09:55.535 --> 01:09:59.537]  According to the tape, Gadon promises to welcome Bush with bombs and traps.
[01:10:01.637 --> 01:10:08.420]  I mean, most of those countries are run by globalist puppet nations that run torture squads, absolute suppression, the people just want to be left alone and want rock and roll music.
[01:10:09.381 --> 01:10:14.143]  Doesn't matter, the American people can't find them on a map and just stumble around calling for police state that will be used on them.
[01:10:14.833 --> 01:10:27.837]  Gadon's appearance is also perfectly timed to boost the flagging poll numbers of Giuliani and other establishment Republican candidates who invoke the imagery threat of terror for political point-scoring before the New Hampshire primary tomorrow.
[01:10:28.337 --> 01:10:32.578]  But who is the mysterious Adam Gadon?
[01:10:33.248 --> 01:10:46.350]  The FBI lists Gadon's aliases as Abu Sa'ib, Al-Amerikai, Abu Sa'ib, Yayan Majinin Adams, Adam Perlman, and Yaya.
[01:10:48.072 --> 01:10:57.137]  Adam Perlman is his real name, and his grandfather is none other than the late Carl K. Perlman, a prominent Jewish urologist in Orange County.
[01:10:57.197 --> 01:11:04.621]  Carl was also a member of the board of directors of the Anti-Defamation League, which was caught spying on Americans for Israel in 1993.
[01:11:05.442 --> 01:11:11.705]  Israel's Mossad intelligence agency was caught in 2002 creating a phony al-Qaeda group to justify attacks on Palestinians.
[01:11:12.065 --> 01:11:16.928]  Perlman has a knack of releasing his tapes at the most politically opportune time for Bush...
[01:11:17.811 --> 01:11:25.656]  Having first burst onto the scene shortly before the 2004 presidential election, and then again right after Katrina, when President Bush's approval rating was tanking fast.
[01:11:27.012 --> 01:11:34.857]  Even more mainstream publications, like the Los Angeles Times City Beat, have dismissed Perlman before as nothing more than cartoonish propaganda.
[01:11:35.277 --> 01:11:42.042]  Perlman had a hippie upbringing and brief but intense flirtation with death metal before a sudden transformation.
[01:11:42.482 --> 01:11:50.988]  Once referred to Muslims as bloodthirsty barbaric terrorists, Perlman was a hardcore Jewish Zionist who wrote essays and screeds bashing the Muslim faith.
[01:11:51.288 --> 01:11:54.530]  He even got into fights at mosques and beat up Muslim worshippers.
[01:11:56.028 --> 01:12:01.910]  Oh, but he magically pops up in these Hollywood-produced Al-Qaeda tapes at key times.
[01:12:01.990 --> 01:12:03.991]  I mean, can you put two and two together here?
[01:12:04.951 --> 01:12:06.692]  Perlman, the hardcore Jewish Zionist.
[01:12:06.712 --> 01:12:10.093]  We have to say Jewish Zionist because, you know, two-thirds of Zionists are Christian Zionists.
[01:12:11.154 --> 01:12:15.178]  Who trashed Muslims and beat them up, grows a beard, and suddenly becomes Al-Qaeda's spokesman.
[01:12:15.598 --> 01:12:16.579]  Nothing suspicious here.
[01:12:16.619 --> 01:12:17.139]  Move along.
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:26.768]  Herman's personal history and the highly suspicious nature in which he suddenly professed his conversion to Islam in a single Internet posting and later appeared on the scene as a spokesman for Al-Qaeda.
[01:12:27.148 --> 01:12:34.114]  Like if Al-Qaeda was real, they'd have some former ADL grandpa suddenly as their head.
[01:12:34.154 --> 01:12:36.416]  I mean, this is just so ridiculous.
[01:12:37.171 --> 01:12:42.632]  After all, the ingredients needed to draw the conclusion that Perlman is working as a double agent, most likely for Mossad.
[01:12:42.912 --> 01:12:44.753]  And it goes on with page after page of evidence.
[01:12:46.453 --> 01:12:49.174]  So, that is up right now.
[01:12:50.934 --> 01:12:52.354]  On PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:12:52.474 --> 01:12:54.415]  A few more plugs here that I hope you'll listen to.
[01:12:54.435 --> 01:12:58.355]  We want to make RonPaulWarRoom.com gigantic.
[01:12:58.695 --> 01:13:00.116]  It's been up since last Thursday.
[01:13:00.156 --> 01:13:02.276]  It's already number 40,000 on Alexa ratings.
[01:13:02.316 --> 01:13:03.116]  That's big.
[01:13:04.037 --> 01:13:05.677]  That's as big as InfoWars.net.
[01:13:06.822 --> 01:13:07.602]  In just a few days.
[01:13:08.122 --> 01:13:11.643]  Thank you for spreading the word about ronpaulwarroom.com.
[01:13:12.963 --> 01:13:19.604]  It is an uncensored place where you can talk about the New World Order, the police state, the different parties in the New World Order.
[01:13:20.244 --> 01:13:28.446]  This is a no-holds-bar area where you can attack me, Ron Paul, where you can praise Ron Paul, where you can post news articles, videos, blogs.
[01:13:28.846 --> 01:13:30.266]  It is an incredible source for us.
[01:13:30.326 --> 01:13:34.507]  Curt Nemo, Paul Watson, Slick Eisen, the whole crew, Dykes,
[01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:39.402]  It is a whole plethora, a cornucopia.
[01:13:39.862 --> 01:13:40.743]  It is a war room.
[01:13:40.823 --> 01:13:41.763]  It is a command base.
[01:13:41.823 --> 01:13:46.525]  It's a place to have a think tank and to war game all this stuff out.
[01:13:46.885 --> 01:13:50.167]  We have about 1,000 people that have signed up to be contributors to it.
[01:13:50.627 --> 01:13:53.008]  We have hundreds of people posting in there at any one time.
[01:13:53.408 --> 01:13:56.310]  Please continue to post in ronpaulwarroom.com.
[01:13:56.630 --> 01:14:01.072]  We're going to be expanding the functions and the features in the next days and weeks to come.
[01:14:01.712 --> 01:14:03.213]  So again, ronpaulwarroom.com.
[01:14:05.154 --> 01:14:13.117]  Also, they haven't updated it since last Friday because they have to combine the PayPal plus the chip-in count, but I know it's well over $30,000 raised by Friday.
[01:14:13.137 --> 01:14:14.977]  It says $26,000 on there.
[01:14:15.897 --> 01:14:20.719]  We'll find out later today how much the Rompel Air Corps has raised.
[01:14:21.608 --> 01:14:24.512]  Trevor Lyman, who runs the RonPaulBlimp.com, called me up.
[01:14:25.072 --> 01:14:25.813]  I had him on yesterday.
[01:14:25.853 --> 01:14:33.782]  He told me he just plans to combine the efforts of their Air Force into ours and just send everybody our way because Ted's already got the planes and the banners.
[01:14:34.122 --> 01:14:36.365]  They got aircraft up over New Hampshire yesterday.
[01:14:36.405 --> 01:14:38.427]  The video of that should be up.
[01:14:38.507 --> 01:14:40.269]  I aimed it to Paul and him about an hour ago.
[01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:41.871]  It just went up.
[01:14:43.226 --> 01:14:43.727]  We're good to go.
[01:15:06.328 --> 01:15:07.288]  And other areas.
[01:15:07.348 --> 01:15:08.409]  I mean, we're not playing games.
[01:15:08.429 --> 01:15:13.310]  We've got enough money now for the flights in New Hampshire and some flights in South Carolina.
[01:15:13.650 --> 01:15:14.811]  But after that, we're out of money.
[01:15:15.011 --> 01:15:18.132]  I've given a thousand smackers to this.
[01:15:18.772 --> 01:15:20.472]  So it is up to you.
[01:15:20.592 --> 01:15:22.353]  Ted, I know, has given about five grand to it.
[01:15:23.113 --> 01:15:26.514]  That's not even counting the money you've given that's up there on the site.
[01:15:26.814 --> 01:15:27.814]  So continue to give.
[01:15:27.914 --> 01:15:29.495]  We've got a third banner coming.
[01:15:30.035 --> 01:15:32.816]  More flights we're trying to book, but we need the money to do that.
[01:15:32.856 --> 01:15:33.736]  So go donate at
[01:15:34.699 --> 01:15:35.979]  Well, because years ago we'd get hack attacks.
[01:15:36.299 --> 01:15:39.620]  And every time we get a bona fide hack attack, we create a new website.
[01:16:04.145 --> 01:16:07.027]  I will tell you that has really discouraged the hackers.
[01:16:07.067 --> 01:16:09.388]  In fact, and I don't mean the good hackers.
[01:16:09.408 --> 01:16:12.490]  Most hackers are actually good patriot type people.
[01:16:12.510 --> 01:16:14.491]  You know, they're free thinkers, obviously.
[01:16:14.991 --> 01:16:15.912]  But the government types.
[01:16:16.032 --> 01:16:18.153]  Because they know that we have a rule.
[01:16:18.253 --> 01:16:19.754]  You attack us, there's a new website.
[01:16:21.035 --> 01:16:22.816]  And there was an attack a few weeks ago again.
[01:16:22.856 --> 01:16:24.036]  That's why there's going to be more.
[01:16:24.096 --> 01:16:24.677]  I'm sorry.
[01:16:25.677 --> 01:16:27.058]  I'm sorry there's not going to be more.
[01:16:27.438 --> 01:16:29.059]  And more webmasters over each one.
[01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:32.181]  And as you continue to attack, there will be more.
[01:16:33.007 --> 01:16:33.427]  We're good to go.
[01:16:33.467 --> 01:16:33.647]  I think?
[01:17:02.250 --> 01:17:05.653]  Info Wars, within a month, will be blog, and then that's set and that's done.
[01:17:05.993 --> 01:17:07.695]  Prison Plant, within three months, will be.
[01:17:10.017 --> 01:17:14.821]  Right now, we're just vetting and testing everything out on truthnews.us and ronpaulwarren.com.
[01:17:14.861 --> 01:17:21.947]  In the next month, we're going to add to all those, vet out different software packages we're using on those two sites, see what you like.
[01:17:22.588 --> 01:17:27.272]  We're going to put a link up asking what you recommend, what programs you recommend, what you like, what advice you've got for us.
[01:17:27.592 --> 01:17:28.333]  We need your help.
[01:17:29.662 --> 01:17:41.325]  And we're trying to create an open intelligence source, an open area where we can come and pool resources, ideas, info, virally spread info, and fight the New World Order.
[01:17:41.385 --> 01:17:51.407]  Because the alternative is mass depression, national draft, total war, police state, forced inoculations, the government controlling your car, controlling your cell phone, controlling your thermostats.
[01:17:52.364 --> 01:17:52.725]  We're good to go.
[01:18:14.902 --> 01:18:16.823]  Google listening to everything you do.
[01:18:17.203 --> 01:18:20.967]  Face scanning cameras from the time you walk outside your house chronicling everything you do.
[01:18:21.927 --> 01:18:23.889]  Chronicling how much you put in your trash can.
[01:18:23.949 --> 01:18:25.250]  Watching every move you make.
[01:18:25.911 --> 01:18:29.814]  Illegal aliens, though, exempt from all these laws just by selective enforcement.
[01:18:31.075 --> 01:18:32.936]  Just absolute wall-to-wall insanity.
[01:18:34.237 --> 01:18:37.760]  We're going to talk to Steve Ray Solomon Judy.
[01:18:39.335 --> 01:18:40.837]  Brian and others when we get back.
[01:18:40.857 --> 01:18:45.541]  Then we've got this North American Union, Trans-Texas Corridor exclusive news as well.
[01:18:45.621 --> 01:18:46.823]  Barry Goldwater Jr.
[01:18:47.704 --> 01:18:48.785]  Absolutely power-packed.
[01:18:48.805 --> 01:18:49.305]  Stay with us.
[01:18:53.930 --> 01:18:58.054]  If your body isn't feeling too well these days, you're going to start taking this hemp.
[01:18:58.194 --> 01:18:59.555]  I say go to hempusa.org.
[01:19:03.923 --> 01:19:08.364]  You may not like what I'm about to say, but you know I'm gonna say it anyway.
[01:19:08.384 --> 01:19:10.805]  The government doesn't want the best for you.
[01:19:11.165 --> 01:19:12.226]  They keep you down.
[01:19:12.406 --> 01:19:13.326]  They keep you blue.
[01:19:13.606 --> 01:19:16.527]  They starve your body for all its nutrients.
[01:19:18.528 --> 01:19:20.648]  They won't let you grow industrial hemp.
[01:19:20.988 --> 01:19:26.350]  It really doesn't make any kind of sense when it's so healthy for the world and useful for you, my friends.
[01:19:28.269 --> 01:19:32.813]  I hope Mr. Bush will hear this song, for the heart of America wants this one.
[01:19:32.853 --> 01:19:36.435]  Go to hempusa.org.
[01:19:37.696 --> 01:19:47.104]  If you're a truther, an anarchist, a renegade, you only want things that God has made, go to hempusa.org.
[01:19:47.144 --> 01:19:49.265]  We offer free shipping anywhere in the states.
[01:19:49.365 --> 01:19:51.947]  Go to hempusa.org.
[01:19:54.019 --> 01:19:55.700]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[01:19:56.020 --> 01:19:59.501]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:19:59.641 --> 01:20:01.502]  But in liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:20:01.522 --> 01:20:04.843]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:20:05.163 --> 01:20:10.665]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[01:20:10.945 --> 01:20:14.886]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:20:15.226 --> 01:20:20.149]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[01:20:20.429 --> 01:20:23.211]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[01:20:44.506 --> 01:20:46.149]  Join PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:20:46.569 --> 01:20:48.413]  Burn the info bombs to dust.
[01:20:48.573 --> 01:20:50.396]  Put them on the file sharing networks.
[01:20:50.716 --> 01:20:52.159]  Bring down the New World Order.
[01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:53.281]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:20:54.725 --> 01:20:58.046]  Attention GCN listeners who suffer from excruciating joint pain.
[01:20:58.386 --> 01:21:05.289]  If you're interested in suppressed but amazingly effective traditional arthritis remedies, this will be the single most important message you'll ever hear.
[01:21:05.669 --> 01:21:18.154]  Recently, a scientist who specializes in ancient medicine has discovered a 3,000-year-old arthritis remedy that has been proven in studies not only to relieve joint pain and inflammation but also to build damaged cartilage as well.
[01:21:18.394 --> 01:21:21.035]  And the amazing thing is just how fast it works.
[01:21:21.375 --> 01:21:27.578]  Now, because the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made for this ancient remedy.
[01:21:27.798 --> 01:21:32.961]  However, it is still legal to own it, and right now a small amount is available to my listeners.
[01:21:33.201 --> 01:21:41.445]  Keep in mind, shipments get filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you take immediate action by going to 321relief.com.
[01:21:41.665 --> 01:21:42.306]  And the best part?
[01:21:42.526 --> 01:21:44.527]  My listeners pay absolutely nothing today.
[01:21:44.787 --> 01:21:47.992]  Simply go to 321relief.com or call 815-259-4552 for details.
[01:21:53.889 --> 01:21:54.530]  It's a fact.
[01:21:54.750 --> 01:22:02.236]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[01:22:02.356 --> 01:22:11.224]  With never-ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[01:22:11.504 --> 01:22:22.033]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecure debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:22:22.073 --> 01:22:22.754]  That's 877-943-8600 or visit FDRS.org.
[01:22:22.774 --> 01:22:24.155]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[01:22:50.217 --> 01:23:01.382]  All right, let's go to Steve in Arizona.
[01:23:01.402 --> 01:23:02.442]  Steve, thanks for holding.
[01:23:02.482 --> 01:23:03.903]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:23:03.923 --> 01:23:06.144]  Hello?
[01:23:06.944 --> 01:23:07.725]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[01:23:07.865 --> 01:23:09.265]  Yeah, first time caller.
[01:23:09.305 --> 01:23:11.426]  I've been listening to the shortwave for 12 years.
[01:23:11.887 --> 01:23:12.547]  Welcome, sir.
[01:23:13.027 --> 01:23:13.427]  Thank you.
[01:23:14.368 --> 01:23:19.550]  I've been thinking about all these voting and cheating, you know, even with Marcos.
[01:23:20.376 --> 01:23:35.829]  And it came to me the other night, the people, when they become visible themselves in their support, not signs or advertisement, when the people wear their support, it stands out.
[01:23:36.389 --> 01:23:41.574]  And you've got a lot of people that if they see people wearing these buttons like they used to have years ago,
[01:23:42.642 --> 01:23:44.702]  They say, hey, everybody's voting for this guy.
[01:23:44.742 --> 01:23:45.463]  He must be good.
[01:23:45.483 --> 01:23:46.423]  They're dumb, you know?
[01:23:46.563 --> 01:23:51.624]  Yeah, that's the whole point of wearing a Ron Paul button is that it stirs up conversation.
[01:23:52.084 --> 01:24:04.326]  It makes people pay attention to you, and that's why we've got blimps, aircraft, the biggest crowds everywhere, only, I mean, literally 90% of the signs I've seen around the country, from California to Dallas to Austin to New York are Ron Paul signs.
[01:24:05.026 --> 01:24:08.227]  And so if he doesn't win, it's going to get pretty obvious, isn't it?
[01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:11.681]  Well, you know, the buttons is more important than anything else.
[01:24:12.741 --> 01:24:14.302]  I've talked to a lot of truck drivers.
[01:24:14.362 --> 01:24:15.182]  I have for years.
[01:24:15.762 --> 01:24:18.984]  I've got a CB base station that I've known all over the damn country.
[01:24:19.584 --> 01:24:26.506]  But I keep telling these guys about New World Order, you know, and Give Your Website, Power Hour, all the people.
[01:24:26.546 --> 01:24:32.388]  I've got a hundred different organizations that I've wrote down and made hundreds of copies for county workers, everybody.
[01:24:33.049 --> 01:24:36.950]  But these buttons, I think if everybody was to wear them,
[01:24:38.150 --> 01:24:40.651]  And, you know, that would be a lot of people.
[01:24:41.432 --> 01:24:43.673]  The others would probably follow suit.
[01:24:44.173 --> 01:24:49.416]  Because, you see, when the people came out after Marcus had been rigging those elections, they went out the streets.
[01:24:50.156 --> 01:24:51.597]  He sent the military out.
[01:24:52.137 --> 01:24:54.678]  And that commander, I remember, he said, what are we doing?
[01:24:55.118 --> 01:24:58.440]  This crazy little man has us going out after our own people.
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:02.922]  And that's when he gave word back to Marcus, you better get out of Dodge.
[01:25:03.662 --> 01:25:04.863]  Well, then he come here, you know.
[01:25:06.029 --> 01:25:06.689]  Well, that's right.
[01:25:06.749 --> 01:25:07.969]  Everybody who's evil does.
[01:25:08.250 --> 01:25:11.630]  And that's the sad part is the establishment has seen that.
[01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:18.112]  So they've slowly trained the police to be attack dogs, to like the bad guys, to like to work for the bad guys.
[01:25:18.152 --> 01:25:22.713]  They dress them in black uniforms and Darth Vader hats, knowing that'll affect their psychology.
[01:25:23.153 --> 01:25:25.233]  They try to brainwash them, but that's not working.
[01:25:25.273 --> 01:25:26.073]  You look at the polls.
[01:25:26.533 --> 01:25:28.674]  They've polled national policing organizations.
[01:25:28.714 --> 01:25:29.594]  They support Paul.
[01:25:30.214 --> 01:25:31.514]  The military supports Paul.
[01:25:31.594 --> 01:25:32.495]  It's not working.
[01:25:33.095 --> 01:25:34.715]  All their propaganda hadn't worked.
[01:25:35.535 --> 01:25:49.580]  On the local level here in this county, I know the top people, and for everybody that does a lot of talking like I do or like you do to a big audience, there's thousands out there that are scared.
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:53.261]  They know what's wrong, but they're afraid to open their mouth.
[01:25:53.621 --> 01:25:55.621]  Well, you know, I understand why people are scared.
[01:25:55.642 --> 01:25:58.923]  It's very dangerous, it's very serious, but it's more dangerous to not stand up.
[01:25:58.963 --> 01:25:59.943]  Thank you for the call, Steve.
[01:26:00.043 --> 01:26:01.203]  Ray in California.
[01:26:01.503 --> 01:26:02.304]  You're on the air, Ray.
[01:26:02.324 --> 01:26:02.884]  You've got the floor.
[01:26:02.924 --> 01:26:03.224]  Go ahead.
[01:26:03.823 --> 01:26:04.523]  Hi, Jones.
[01:26:04.883 --> 01:26:05.104]  Hi.
[01:26:05.404 --> 01:26:05.644]  Hi.
[01:26:06.344 --> 01:26:06.984]  First time caller.
[01:26:07.365 --> 01:26:08.385]  I appreciate everything you do.
[01:26:08.585 --> 01:26:09.105]  Welcome, sir.
[01:26:10.126 --> 01:26:16.088]  I wanted to, you know, I agree with about 99.9999% of what you say.
[01:26:16.108 --> 01:26:17.189]  You don't have to preface it.
[01:26:17.209 --> 01:26:18.069]  You disagree with something.
[01:26:18.089 --> 01:26:18.509]  Go ahead.
[01:26:19.110 --> 01:26:23.011]  Well, you know, you're against marijuana.
[01:26:23.291 --> 01:26:26.573]  I'm a 215 patient in California, and...
[01:26:28.089 --> 01:26:28.989]  I believe it's medicine.
[01:26:29.550 --> 01:26:33.672]  It's, you know, I think FDA, right, they classified it as a drug.
[01:26:34.932 --> 01:26:37.494]  Well, you're taking out of context what I'm saying.
[01:26:37.514 --> 01:26:41.956]  I am for total drug legalization and decriminalization.
[01:26:42.796 --> 01:26:49.640]  The states have voted for that, and the feds have said no, showing that we're not in a free society, and the 10th Amendment has gone down the toilet.
[01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:52.741]  But at the same time, I don't think the drug culture is cool.
[01:26:53.121 --> 01:26:54.762]  I don't think pot smoking is cool.
[01:26:54.802 --> 01:26:56.003]  I don't think drinking is cool.
[01:26:56.781 --> 01:26:57.021]  I agree.
[01:26:57.041 --> 01:27:02.927]  I understand it's a magical drug, THC, especially when it's tied in with the natural oils that the body needs for absorption.
[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:17.102]  It's best of the plant form.
[01:27:17.122 --> 01:27:18.704]  George Washington smoked marijuana.
[01:27:21.367 --> 01:27:24.250]  It was in the medicine books back then for hundreds of different things.
[01:27:24.931 --> 01:27:33.320]  I understand all that, and I know they banned it because it was challenging the cotton producers and the oil producers who wanted to control the...
[01:27:35.602 --> 01:27:38.863]  New types of clothing made out of petrol chemicals.
[01:27:39.224 --> 01:27:40.964]  So I understand all of that.
[01:27:41.424 --> 01:27:43.445]  It's just I'm talking about the culture of drugs.
[01:27:43.485 --> 01:27:45.386]  I want young people to know it's not cool.
[01:27:45.946 --> 01:27:50.068]  And most people I know that are potheads, it saps their force.
[01:27:50.168 --> 01:27:51.988]  It saps their energy.
[01:27:52.068 --> 01:27:55.430]  It turns them into potatoes that sit there watching television.
[01:27:57.030 --> 01:27:59.331]  Have you seen AboveTheInfluence.com?
[01:27:59.371 --> 01:28:01.692]  Have you seen any ads for that website?
[01:28:02.865 --> 01:28:03.105]  No.
[01:28:03.445 --> 01:28:04.485]  Total propaganda.
[01:28:06.086 --> 01:28:17.568]  They put their advertisement in, like, Nintendo magazines and stuff like that, and they're just... But studies show those advertisements actually increase drug use.
[01:28:17.588 --> 01:28:18.368]  I appreciate your call.
[01:28:18.588 --> 01:28:19.889]  We can talk about marijuana some other day.
[01:28:19.929 --> 01:28:21.989]  I'm out of time now, but very interesting point.
[01:28:22.769 --> 01:28:29.551]  Look, I've smoked pot before, and it made me feel like I just wanted to sit there and giggle on a couch.
[01:28:31.311 --> 01:28:31.551]  I mean...
[01:28:32.699 --> 01:28:35.582]  And I couldn't wait to not be high, as they call it.
[01:28:35.602 --> 01:28:36.383]  I mean, I don't like it.
[01:28:36.723 --> 01:28:37.744]  I like having my brain.
[01:28:38.445 --> 01:28:40.106]  I like having all the neurons firing.
[01:28:40.126 --> 01:28:41.728]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:28:41.748 --> 01:28:42.168]  I don't like it.
[01:28:44.210 --> 01:28:45.171]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.612 --> 01:28:47.253]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.273 --> 01:28:50.857]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.344 --> 01:28:58.606]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:28:58.866 --> 01:29:03.767]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:29:03.967 --> 01:29:05.308]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:29:05.468 --> 01:29:08.849]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?
[01:29:09.089 --> 01:29:14.271]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% of the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.
[01:29:14.491 --> 01:29:20.253]  Marty Schachter founded Calbin Soap Company in 1947 and provided products for health institutions.
[01:29:20.593 --> 01:29:23.015]  Now, Calbin soaps are available to you and me.
[01:29:23.115 --> 01:29:25.417]  Triple concentrated for all your cleaning needs.
[01:29:25.637 --> 01:29:27.778]  From bathing and laundry to dishes, hair, and more.
[01:29:28.058 --> 01:29:29.019]  No harsh chemicals.
[01:29:29.259 --> 01:29:30.200]  No animal testing.
[01:29:30.460 --> 01:29:33.402]  I use them and love them, knowing they're all naturally safe.
[01:29:33.662 --> 01:29:34.803]  And I save big time.
[01:29:35.083 --> 01:29:36.684]  Call Calbin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[01:29:36.804 --> 01:29:37.305]  That's 1-800-340-7091.
[01:29:37.325 --> 01:29:39.806]  Or log on to 5starsoap.com now for a free catalog.
[01:29:46.551 --> 01:29:53.096]  Again, that number, 1-800-340-7091, or 5starsoap.com, for all your cleaning needs.
[01:29:54.357 --> 01:29:54.857]  Hi, neighbor.
[01:29:55.057 --> 01:29:56.939]  This is Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[01:29:57.539 --> 01:30:00.141]  Life is a gamble, but you can stack the deck.
[01:30:01.062 --> 01:30:10.289]  If you knew what I know about all the problems food will protect you from, you'd start immediately to put every effort and dollar you can get into the biggest supply of food possible.
[01:30:10.996 --> 01:30:25.168]  When the dollar and economy crash, when the imported and genetically poisoned food is all that's left, when the quarantine and bird flu hit, our only protection and only chance to be fearless is having control of our own supply of food and enough of it.
[01:30:25.448 --> 01:30:33.135]  But if you knew what we haven't yet discovered, you wouldn't waste time listening to the rest of this announcement before charging out and getting a serious food supply.
[01:30:33.675 --> 01:30:34.215]  Decide.
[01:30:34.636 --> 01:30:36.497]  It's food now or probably never.
[01:30:36.898 --> 01:30:38.159]  But can you afford to be wrong?
[01:30:38.839 --> 01:30:39.560]  Decide now.
[01:30:40.020 --> 01:30:40.801]  Place your bet.
[01:30:41.602 --> 01:30:43.063]  Can you afford to be wrong?
[01:30:43.443 --> 01:30:45.024]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com Call 800-409-5633
[01:30:54.381 --> 01:30:55.041]  We're good to go.
[01:31:12.270 --> 01:31:18.953]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:19.293 --> 01:31:20.894]  There are no reported side effects.
[01:31:21.194 --> 01:31:24.376]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:31:24.656 --> 01:31:27.117]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[01:31:27.417 --> 01:31:34.140]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:31:34.580 --> 01:31:37.023]  For more information, call BioSolutions toll-free at 866-885-6625.
[01:31:37.063 --> 01:31:37.544]  That's 866-885-6625.
[01:31:37.604 --> 01:31:39.667]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.
[01:32:16.977 --> 01:32:33.259]  All right, coming up, we're going to get into the government to remote control your thermostats, the government to track all the guns you buy by serial numbers.
[01:32:34.220 --> 01:32:42.849]  The government to put cameras in all your neighborhoods, face scanning the time you leave your home, what you do, who visits you, everything to be stored in databases.
[01:32:43.249 --> 01:32:46.392]  Basically, just like the Internet's tracked, the real world is being tracked.
[01:32:46.792 --> 01:32:47.973]  All Pentagon designed.
[01:32:48.254 --> 01:32:49.875]  Now it's finally in the mainstream news.
[01:32:50.296 --> 01:32:51.537]  They're rolling it all out.
[01:32:52.618 --> 01:32:57.042]  Real criminals, laws, the government violates any of those they wish.
[01:32:57.082 --> 01:32:59.104]  It's all about controlling you, the cattle.
[01:32:59.870 --> 01:33:04.272]  And then we have Solomon, Julie, Brian, Rich, Rick, Robert, many others.
[01:33:04.292 --> 01:33:05.552]  We're going to get to your calls as well.
[01:33:06.672 --> 01:33:07.673]  Barry Goldwater, Jr.
[01:33:07.713 --> 01:33:10.474]  isn't on in the last 30 minutes of the broadcast with us.
[01:33:10.494 --> 01:33:20.857]  We'll have plenty of time coming up in the next hour, in those 30 minutes, to take your phone calls and, of course, also get into some of that police state news today.
[01:33:20.877 --> 01:33:25.139]  For the next 20 minutes or so, Stuart Nelson, I've known for years,
[01:33:26.092 --> 01:33:46.031]  I guess more than 10 years is a guest in studio with us, and Stuart happened to come across, because some of the folks in Waco discovered it, not just the maps that the Texas Department of Transportation put out calling it the Trans-Texas Corridor or the Napa Superhighway, but the actual plots, the actual more detailed maps.
[01:33:46.451 --> 01:33:48.233]  Now, since they got these six months ago,
[01:33:49.362 --> 01:33:57.946]  And Stuart's been trying to get folks to report on it, and nobody's had the time to do it, so he brought them to me, and here we are, day one, getting it out to you, because this is important information.
[01:33:58.386 --> 01:34:01.328]  Now, we have the mainstream media at the same time in CNN.
[01:34:02.128 --> 01:34:03.529]  We have the Boston Globe.
[01:34:03.589 --> 01:34:04.269]  We have the L.A.
[01:34:04.309 --> 01:34:04.710]  Times.
[01:34:04.910 --> 01:34:07.431]  All in the last month saying, this doesn't even exist.
[01:34:07.691 --> 01:34:10.993]  Now, they say on record, there is no trans-Texas corridor.
[01:34:11.033 --> 01:34:12.913]  They say that doesn't even exist.
[01:34:12.933 --> 01:34:15.875]  Now, Perry says it's part of the Napa Superhighway system.
[01:34:16.603 --> 01:34:17.224]  It doesn't matter.
[01:34:17.284 --> 01:34:18.445]  They just say it doesn't exist.
[01:34:18.485 --> 01:34:19.666]  They say the maps don't exist.
[01:34:19.686 --> 01:34:20.547]  They say we're lying.
[01:34:20.567 --> 01:34:28.573]  It doesn't matter if we got all these from the Texas Department of Transportation and the Federal Department of Transportation.
[01:34:28.974 --> 01:34:32.056]  But Stewart has maps that they won't release anymore.
[01:34:32.337 --> 01:34:44.467]  So to tell us how he got them and then basically what it covers and how it also runs the I-35 Napa Superhighway right over, I mean physically over the Branch Davidian Memorial Church,
[01:34:45.207 --> 01:34:48.768]  That was built for the dead Davidians and the victims as well as the police.
[01:34:49.129 --> 01:34:55.511]  There's a memorial chapel and magically it takes a turn especially so it can run right over that marker.
[01:34:55.551 --> 01:35:01.293]  It's kind of like a wounded knee there and they want that to be forgotten and have the Trans-Texas Corridor right over the top of it.
[01:35:01.773 --> 01:35:08.536]  So joining us is Stuart Nelson who helped as one of the volunteer coordinators with George Pulliam and others build that memorial church.
[01:35:08.556 --> 01:35:09.676]  Stuart, good to have you here, my friend.
[01:35:09.976 --> 01:35:10.676]  It's good to be here.
[01:35:10.796 --> 01:35:12.257]  I appreciate you covering this.
[01:35:13.417 --> 01:35:19.439]  I want to give a shout-out also to all those people that showed up from all over the country to help rebuild that church.
[01:35:20.599 --> 01:35:23.900]  Alex, Mike Hanson, George Pulliam put out a call.
[01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:32.622]  I guess, Alex, you were on KJFK at the time, and you kind of got run off the air for promoting that.
[01:35:34.863 --> 01:35:39.704]  But volunteers came from all over the country, and actually out of the country.
[01:35:40.828 --> 01:35:41.689]  To rebuild that church.
[01:35:41.729 --> 01:35:43.851]  We worked on it hard for seven months.
[01:35:45.773 --> 01:35:51.319]  And the guy that lives there now found out about these maps.
[01:35:51.699 --> 01:35:53.762]  McClendon County is the county in Waco.
[01:35:54.712 --> 01:35:55.533]  That Waco is in.
[01:35:55.553 --> 01:36:01.418]  That's the same county that banned protesting anywhere in the county because George Bush's ranch is in the county.
[01:36:01.658 --> 01:36:02.339]  Right, right.
[01:36:02.919 --> 01:36:14.990]  And they... So we have... We were able to go down to McLennan County, pick up the actual certified maps that now they won't release anymore.
[01:36:15.310 --> 01:36:16.151]  Because they don't exist.
[01:36:16.611 --> 01:36:17.012]  That's right.
[01:36:17.052 --> 01:36:17.692]  It's fantasy.
[01:36:17.952 --> 01:36:21.916]  So even though it says on here TTC route...
[01:36:23.162 --> 01:36:24.343]  Just hold that up and show the camera.
[01:36:24.363 --> 01:36:29.207]  We're going to show close-ups on this when we actually put it out on the web and at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:36:29.227 --> 01:36:32.890]  But over there on the side, it says Trans-Texas Corridor Disclosure.
[01:36:33.891 --> 01:36:36.713]  And there it is for everybody right there.
[01:36:36.733 --> 01:36:38.454]  Doesn't exist, though.
[01:36:38.714 --> 01:36:39.495]  Doesn't exist, no.
[01:36:40.115 --> 01:36:41.516]  In fact, you don't exist.
[01:36:41.536 --> 01:36:42.317]  You're probably a phantom.
[01:36:42.757 --> 01:36:43.058]  I am.
[01:36:43.298 --> 01:36:43.558]  I am.
[01:36:44.679 --> 01:36:51.344]  Also, another interesting possibility is a bunch of the family that owns property around...
[01:36:52.594 --> 01:36:57.717]  The Ranch Davidian Survivors Memorial Church there is the Perry family.
[01:36:57.757 --> 01:36:58.557]  We don't know yet.
[01:36:58.757 --> 01:37:00.478]  Also, the Beelows have their ranch out there.
[01:37:00.718 --> 01:37:01.138]  Right, right.
[01:37:02.219 --> 01:37:03.159]  Beelow Broadcasting.
[01:37:03.439 --> 01:37:03.679]  Right.
[01:37:03.899 --> 01:37:05.300]  So, hmm.
[01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:10.203]  Well, we don't know for sure if it's any relation to the current sitting governor.
[01:37:10.763 --> 01:37:12.804]  And by the way, they've said that they don't care.
[01:37:13.224 --> 01:37:15.525]  They're going to take property from whoever they want for this highway.
[01:37:15.725 --> 01:37:16.145]  That's right.
[01:37:16.386 --> 01:37:16.786]  That's right.
[01:37:17.975 --> 01:37:24.491]  The southbound lane of the trans-Texas corridor rolling through Waco rolls literally right over the top of the church.
[01:37:25.113 --> 01:37:26.556]  And for all of you that were out there
[01:37:27.652 --> 01:37:30.875]  Your hearts broke like mine did when I saw that church on fire.
[01:37:31.195 --> 01:37:45.345]  By the way, they would also say that they didn't shoot incendiary rounds at the church, and then we even dug up the actual grenade CS gas incendiary rounds, the type that you're not supposed to use in buildings because they burn.
[01:37:45.585 --> 01:37:46.806]  That's how it puts the gas out.
[01:37:47.066 --> 01:37:50.329]  We actually dug those up after they cleaned it up.
[01:37:50.549 --> 01:37:50.769]  Right.
[01:37:50.789 --> 01:37:50.909]  Right.
[01:38:16.910 --> 01:38:18.831]  And so now they're going to... Covering up the crime scene.
[01:38:19.051 --> 01:38:19.231]  Right.
[01:38:19.431 --> 01:38:20.771]  Now they're just going to pave over it.
[01:38:20.831 --> 01:38:26.793]  I don't know if they'll have a little, you know, thoughtful memorial there at the side of the trans-Texas corridor.
[01:38:27.334 --> 01:38:30.895]  You know, it's mind-blowing that they're just going to pave over it.
[01:38:30.915 --> 01:38:32.455]  This is what they did in New York City, too.
[01:38:32.735 --> 01:38:32.915]  Yeah.
[01:38:33.036 --> 01:38:34.916]  Taking body parts, paving roads with it.
[01:38:35.396 --> 01:38:36.717]  That was in the Associated Press.
[01:38:37.017 --> 01:38:39.838]  Now, you've actually got a smaller zoom-in on that...
[01:38:40.911 --> 01:38:43.392]  Now, that's a map of a whole section of Waco.
[01:38:44.032 --> 01:38:47.633]  And on the detailed map, there's that little pond or little lake there on the property.
[01:38:48.133 --> 01:38:51.434]  It's only about 75, 100 feet from the church.
[01:38:52.095 --> 01:38:53.015]  They have the map here.
[01:38:53.135 --> 01:38:58.957]  It shows the middle of the southbound lane runs exactly over the church.
[01:38:59.277 --> 01:39:01.578]  Right over the top of it.
[01:39:01.718 --> 01:39:03.038]  I mean, just exactly.
[01:39:03.098 --> 01:39:04.499]  Not beside, not near.
[01:39:04.939 --> 01:39:08.440]  I mean, the road runs exactly over the church.
[01:39:09.540 --> 01:39:09.740]  Right.
[01:39:09.820 --> 01:39:10.540]  In fact, point that out.
[01:39:10.580 --> 01:39:13.101]  Hold it up for people out there in TV land and show them.
[01:39:16.922 --> 01:39:19.062]  This is the actual property right here.
[01:39:20.463 --> 01:39:23.003]  This is the Trans-Texas Corridor coming through.
[01:39:23.023 --> 01:39:28.665]  I took a sharpie and kind of highlighted a little bit so that you can see.
[01:39:28.685 --> 01:39:30.585]  But they have their own lines there.
[01:39:30.785 --> 01:39:31.025]  Right.
[01:39:31.405 --> 01:39:35.026]  And it literally rolls southbound lane right over the top of the church.
[01:39:35.266 --> 01:39:36.726]  Show people where the church is with your fingers.
[01:39:36.746 --> 01:39:38.807]  The church is right in the middle right here.
[01:39:39.986 --> 01:39:40.626]  I shouldn't laugh.
[01:39:40.686 --> 01:39:41.507]  It's just so sick.
[01:39:42.407 --> 01:39:45.488]  It's just mind-blowing.
[01:39:46.108 --> 01:39:51.030]  And I do have some good news concerning the survivors.
[01:39:51.550 --> 01:39:54.371]  All the survivors that were in prison are now out.
[01:39:55.660 --> 01:40:03.227]  Oh, and by the way, the federal judge, Walter E. Smith, when he had the trial, the Davidians were found not guilty of murder in all charges.
[01:40:03.247 --> 01:40:05.049]  Then he said, I'm using federal sentencing.
[01:40:05.449 --> 01:40:07.891]  You're guilty of using firearms in the commission of a murder.
[01:40:08.211 --> 01:40:12.896]  How are you found guilty of using firearms in the commission of a murder when you're found not guilty of murder?
[01:40:12.936 --> 01:40:15.098]  The Supreme Court said let him go, and last time I heard...
[01:40:15.738 --> 01:40:19.939]  Five years after the Supreme Court said let him go, they still hadn't, but I guess they had to.
[01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:22.660]  And I talked to Clive Doyle last night.
[01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:28.402]  I gave him a call, talked to him, and he said the last guy to be released was Livingston Fagan, who is from England.
[01:40:29.322 --> 01:40:30.042]  He's deported.
[01:40:30.902 --> 01:40:32.363]  They were able to go visit him in prison.
[01:40:32.403 --> 01:40:34.884]  They were able to go visit him in the halfway house.
[01:40:34.924 --> 01:40:36.424]  They were able to communicate with him.
[01:40:37.648 --> 01:40:46.764]  But once they were released, on early release, they were forbidden from having any contact with any of the former church members.
[01:40:47.485 --> 01:40:50.531]  And I'm not a Branch Davidian, but we know...
[01:40:51.585 --> 01:40:53.346]  Those people were not doing anything to harm anybody.
[01:40:53.366 --> 01:40:55.767]  Yeah, the official story was 99% fraud.
[01:40:56.007 --> 01:41:00.428]  We had the BATF videos where they're unloading the tapes saying we're going to get great publicity and funding off this.
[01:41:00.748 --> 01:41:02.869]  They knew Koresh went off the property every day.
[01:41:03.109 --> 01:41:06.551]  They knew he worked at an auto repair shop a few miles away.
[01:41:06.971 --> 01:41:08.211]  Robby turned off the main highway.
[01:41:08.591 --> 01:41:09.752]  They could have picked him up any time.
[01:41:09.772 --> 01:41:10.152]  They didn't.
[01:41:10.172 --> 01:41:13.153]  They wanted to go attack a bunch of, quote, kooks to get funding.
[01:41:13.433 --> 01:41:13.613]  Right.
[01:41:14.093 --> 01:41:17.715]  And we've said over and over and over and over again, we'll never forget Waco.
[01:41:17.855 --> 01:41:18.735]  Never forget Waco.
[01:41:18.755 --> 01:41:19.596]  Never forget Waco.
[01:41:19.696 --> 01:41:22.297]  Well, right now, they're planning on paving over the whole thing.
[01:41:22.437 --> 01:41:23.717]  And let's tell folks how this started.
[01:41:23.737 --> 01:41:25.218]  This is a multifaceted story.
[01:41:26.418 --> 01:41:29.300]  I first met you, Stuart, if memory serves, back in, what, 1998?
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:31.460]  They were going to bull... Or was it 97?
[01:41:32.061 --> 01:41:35.722]  They were going to bulldoze Joe Campana, World War II vet's house.
[01:41:36.823 --> 01:41:39.504]  They were openly bragging neighbors how they were going to steal the property.
[01:41:39.524 --> 01:41:42.125]  It was in a gentrifying area off over there...
[01:41:43.169 --> 01:41:43.650]  We're good to go.
[01:42:06.212 --> 01:42:09.034]  And so we said, well, we'll try to fix this house.
[01:42:09.054 --> 01:42:10.455]  And the cops came and said, we're going to arrest you.
[01:42:10.795 --> 01:42:11.455]  It's condemned.
[01:42:11.856 --> 01:42:13.317]  And then we said, okay, well, let us get permits.
[01:42:13.337 --> 01:42:14.137]  They said, no permits.
[01:42:14.157 --> 01:42:15.018]  We're taking the property.
[01:42:15.358 --> 01:42:16.759]  So then we just said, go ahead and arrest us.
[01:42:16.839 --> 01:42:20.981]  And a city record, 14 days, fully furnished, built a brand new house.
[01:42:21.341 --> 01:42:23.042]  He got to use it for about five years and died.
[01:42:23.062 --> 01:42:28.486]  But to make a long story short, then Mike Hanson really had the idea.
[01:42:28.526 --> 01:42:32.328]  We were out there doing a story at Waco, and we had, I think Extra was with us.
[01:42:33.138 --> 01:42:35.499]  And, you know, interviewing Clyde Willem.
[01:42:35.519 --> 01:42:41.640]  Mike said, we ought to just build, instead of that little museum they've got that's one room, maybe a little bit bigger chapel so they can have a memorial for a few dozen people.
[01:42:41.660 --> 01:42:42.640]  And I said, okay.
[01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:45.201]  And then George Pulliam got involved and turned it into this gigantic thing.
[01:42:45.481 --> 01:42:46.481]  Tell them what we ended up building.
[01:42:46.501 --> 01:42:47.801]  Oh, my goodness.
[01:42:48.641 --> 01:42:56.503]  George Pulliam's an architect engineer, and he drew the plans for an actual church, not just some little...
[01:42:57.949 --> 01:42:58.530]  We're good to go.
[01:43:05.578 --> 01:43:06.078]  We're good to go.
[01:43:28.045 --> 01:43:34.352]  Fireproofing treatment, and George and I fireproofed all the plywood and studs and everything.
[01:43:34.372 --> 01:43:35.714]  I remember going under it and spraying it.
[01:43:35.774 --> 01:43:39.638]  Yeah, to protect it from any future firebombing.
[01:43:40.266 --> 01:43:43.908]  And by the way, there have been people out there trying to burn stuff down.
[01:43:44.388 --> 01:43:47.910]  They had a bus out there that they burned, people shooting at them.
[01:43:47.930 --> 01:43:49.872]  There have been all kinds of stuff over the years.
[01:43:49.972 --> 01:43:59.057]  And still, yeah, still, even recently, they've had people drive by, I don't know, local rednecks or whatever, shooting, and they've got bullet holes in the front of the church now.
[01:44:00.418 --> 01:44:03.259]  And people driving by yelling, burn, baby, burn.
[01:44:03.279 --> 01:44:04.260]  I mean, just crazy.
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:05.821]  Just lunatic stuff.
[01:44:07.542 --> 01:44:09.183]  But, the
[01:44:10.825 --> 01:44:15.167]  The survivors that were in prison are now out.
[01:44:15.827 --> 01:44:17.088]  So that's a good thing.
[01:44:17.348 --> 01:44:20.970]  Of course, the Davidians, the few that still live out there, are so quiet they won't even complain.
[01:44:21.330 --> 01:44:24.231]  Can you imagine if that was a black church or a synagogue or something?
[01:44:24.251 --> 01:44:25.032]  Oh, gosh.
[01:44:25.472 --> 01:44:26.432]  And it got shot up.
[01:44:26.452 --> 01:44:29.414]  Of course, it's usually the ADL doing it.
[01:44:29.774 --> 01:44:30.614]  But to actually see that happen...
[01:44:33.326 --> 01:44:33.586]  Right.
[01:44:34.327 --> 01:44:43.798]  And I'm just... And the Davidian survivors that I've gotten to know, I'm amazed at the forgiveness that they have.
[01:44:45.832 --> 01:44:48.534]  I think I'd be reacting somewhat differently.
[01:44:48.574 --> 01:44:52.016]  Well, the bigger story here is that they are going to bulldoze the church.
[01:44:52.257 --> 01:44:53.057]  It does exist.
[01:44:53.117 --> 01:44:55.099]  This is the big Napa Superhighway right here.
[01:44:55.239 --> 01:45:01.664]  I mean, people in the media always focus on the I-35 Supercorridor because that's one of the 83 and the first they plan to build.
[01:45:01.724 --> 01:45:03.746]  Most of it's existing infrastructure and roads.
[01:45:03.786 --> 01:45:10.371]  They're grabbing, tolling, using to fund roads in Mexico and building more of this infrastructure, which they're going to control and is internationalized.
[01:45:12.211 --> 01:45:13.192]  But this is it.
[01:45:13.232 --> 01:45:14.832]  It says Trans-Napta Highway.
[01:45:14.872 --> 01:45:17.913]  It says TTC, Trans-Texas Corridor.
[01:45:18.573 --> 01:45:20.313]  And this just isn't the little maps they put out.
[01:45:20.693 --> 01:45:23.374]  This is the real deal, and it shows it all, Stuart.
[01:45:23.394 --> 01:45:24.074]  Tell us about that.
[01:45:24.094 --> 01:45:24.814]  Let's talk about that.
[01:45:25.134 --> 01:45:31.976]  Well, we've got, you know, I mean, there's no questioning, and absolutely this is the official TTC map.
[01:45:32.476 --> 01:45:36.237]  Of course, the TTC doesn't exist, but they've... I...
[01:45:38.849 --> 01:45:50.402]  I tell you, for me, it also brought up a lot of questions about why those people... I mean, it just brings up more questions why they actually went after the Davidians and now they're going to pave over it and just... You know what I mean?
[01:45:50.442 --> 01:45:54.726]  I mean, it's just... Well, it's out there just a few miles from that secret Air Force base.
[01:45:54.786 --> 01:45:56.128]  By secret, it's high security.
[01:45:56.747 --> 01:46:02.471]  Where they fly in the president, and before that flew in all these weird operations, a lot of evidence of government drugs being shipped in there.
[01:46:02.491 --> 01:46:03.511]  Right, Clinton was out there.
[01:46:03.631 --> 01:46:06.773]  Yeah, Clinton was always out there doing weird stuff before he was even president and after.
[01:46:07.254 --> 01:46:12.377]  And then you've got just the B-Lows next door, and you've got who own B-Low Broadcasting.
[01:46:12.797 --> 01:46:13.318]  Yeah, right.
[01:46:13.478 --> 01:46:17.921]  So I guess potentially they stand to fill their pockets pretty well.
[01:46:17.941 --> 01:46:19.502]  Yeah, this goes over B-Low property, too.
[01:46:19.982 --> 01:46:21.683]  Well, I'm sure they'll compensate down.
[01:46:22.526 --> 01:46:28.769]  But, you know, anybody else that just has a couple acres, we've got to stop this.
[01:46:28.829 --> 01:46:30.210]  This has got to be spoken out about.
[01:46:30.250 --> 01:46:31.611]  But it doesn't exist, sir.
[01:46:32.611 --> 01:46:32.952]  Okay.
[01:46:34.132 --> 01:46:39.075]  Well, we've got the official maps, so they can't... It doesn't exist.
[01:46:39.295 --> 01:46:44.618]  Okay, well, we're going to continue to speak out in our psychological...
[01:46:45.956 --> 01:46:46.817]  But see how they do that?
[01:46:46.857 --> 01:46:48.838]  So we always have to address that it exists.
[01:46:48.878 --> 01:46:53.621]  Instead of having a debate about do we want this, the debate's always does it exist while they build it.
[01:46:53.781 --> 01:46:57.823]  The Texas legislature put up moratorium on the trans-Texas corridor.
[01:46:57.963 --> 01:46:59.724]  And then Perry just said, I don't care, I'm doing it.
[01:46:59.844 --> 01:47:00.585]  Right, he vetoed it.
[01:47:00.625 --> 01:47:01.705]  But that doesn't exist either.
[01:47:01.725 --> 01:47:02.846]  But that doesn't exist either.
[01:47:03.547 --> 01:47:05.029]  It's a confusing world we live in.
[01:47:05.190 --> 01:47:06.712]  And election fraud doesn't exist either.
[01:47:06.812 --> 01:47:07.894]  No, no.
[01:47:08.155 --> 01:47:09.657]  Nothing exists, except what they say exists.
[01:47:09.717 --> 01:47:11.060]  And Ron Paul's a communist.
[01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:14.346]  The list goes on and on.
[01:47:18.109 --> 01:47:20.730]  Well, the good news is we are awake to this.
[01:47:20.750 --> 01:47:23.071]  So, Charlie Pace dug these out.
[01:47:23.571 --> 01:47:25.812]  Charles Pace, who lives on the property, dug them out.
[01:47:26.492 --> 01:47:28.753]  He's a wife, daughter, two boys.
[01:47:29.633 --> 01:47:30.373]  Really nice fella.
[01:47:30.974 --> 01:47:31.974]  So, all this happened.
[01:47:31.994 --> 01:47:33.314]  He's the caretaker out there now.
[01:47:33.915 --> 01:47:36.615]  And you've since tried to go back and get more.
[01:47:36.655 --> 01:47:38.776]  And they say, there's no such thing.
[01:47:38.816 --> 01:47:39.296]  It doesn't exist.
[01:47:39.336 --> 01:47:41.937]  They act very spooky, very weird.
[01:47:42.197 --> 01:47:43.278]  No, we don't have those.
[01:47:43.358 --> 01:47:46.639]  And they start rubbing their hands together and get all nervous.
[01:47:46.759 --> 01:47:46.839]  And
[01:47:47.339 --> 01:47:48.040]  No, we don't have those.
[01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:48.860]  No, we don't have those.
[01:47:49.660 --> 01:47:50.941]  And, well, what are you talking about?
[01:47:50.981 --> 01:47:52.142]  We just got three copies.
[01:47:52.202 --> 01:47:56.284]  Well, it's like when we got the map where they're going to turn Mopac into a toll road three years ago.
[01:47:56.304 --> 01:47:57.545]  And they said, that's a conspiracy.
[01:47:57.565 --> 01:47:57.905]  We're not.
[01:47:57.945 --> 01:47:59.166]  And then now they announce they're doing it.
[01:48:00.967 --> 01:48:03.408]  I mean, they deny it right until the bulldozers come in.
[01:48:03.709 --> 01:48:05.049]  You know, right until they add the tollbooths.
[01:48:05.409 --> 01:48:06.030]  Right, right.
[01:48:08.851 --> 01:48:11.273]  Well, I don't know what else we can do other than, you know, just...
[01:48:12.403 --> 01:48:16.086]  Well, we're going to continue to speak out about it, so we're not going to shut up, ever.
[01:48:16.646 --> 01:48:19.268]  Well, the establishment's really got it out for those Davidians.
[01:48:19.408 --> 01:48:22.089]  I don't understand that.
[01:48:22.169 --> 01:48:25.992]  Well, there's a little history back there, too, on that actual property.
[01:48:26.032 --> 01:48:30.394]  There were actual local Indians that lived on that property, and they were murdered and butchered.
[01:48:30.495 --> 01:48:31.095]  Yeah, I knew that.
[01:48:31.555 --> 01:48:33.376]  And there's a natural spring there.
[01:48:35.358 --> 01:48:40.861]  That's what that lake's a part of, and they poured concrete all over the top of that after they murdered all the people there.
[01:48:41.665 --> 01:48:44.887]  And so there's a long history.
[01:48:44.927 --> 01:48:46.348]  That ground's got a lot of blood in it.
[01:48:46.368 --> 01:48:48.489]  There will be blood.
[01:48:49.009 --> 01:48:52.751]  Yeah, and so it's absolutely crazy.
[01:48:52.771 --> 01:49:01.997]  And for all of you that were part of, you know, that came and joined in on the effort to rebuild that church, you know, that might make you want to...
[01:49:03.394 --> 01:49:05.978]  Remember in the middle of the summer it was like 105 degrees?
[01:49:06.239 --> 01:49:08.523]  We're out there with pickaxes digging those, was it 36 holes?
[01:49:08.643 --> 01:49:09.564]  Oh gosh, yeah.
[01:49:09.644 --> 01:49:11.668]  How many of those big pylons we put in?
[01:49:11.708 --> 01:49:12.309]  Right, right.
[01:49:12.349 --> 01:49:13.471]  Those big piers, yeah.
[01:49:13.891 --> 01:49:15.073]  And it was brutal.
[01:49:15.093 --> 01:49:15.995]  And then you dig up like
[01:49:16.937 --> 01:49:20.120]  Toy dolls of babies with bullet holes in them and stuff.
[01:49:20.180 --> 01:49:21.100]  I mean, it was incredible.
[01:49:21.341 --> 01:49:22.602]  There was a bone in there.
[01:49:22.702 --> 01:49:30.628]  And after the government cleaned all that up with bulldozers and all that, we found, I mean, just big number 10 coffee cans full.
[01:49:30.648 --> 01:49:36.513]  I mean, we could just fill up a number 10 coffee can full of shells and casings and old hand grenades.
[01:49:36.573 --> 01:49:38.335]  Remember all that stuff that we saw?
[01:49:38.375 --> 01:49:41.157]  They had a bunch of it up in the front little...
[01:49:41.952 --> 01:49:42.372]  Store.
[01:49:42.412 --> 01:49:43.693]  They had a little memorial.
[01:49:43.713 --> 01:49:44.333]  Stay there, Stuart.
[01:49:44.353 --> 01:49:45.893]  Let's talk about what you'd like to see happen.
[01:49:45.953 --> 01:49:49.074]  How do you fight something that you deny exists as they build it?
[01:49:49.514 --> 01:49:50.194]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:50.214 --> 01:49:51.495]  Stay with us.
[01:49:54.675 --> 01:49:56.076]  It is a big idea.
[01:49:56.096 --> 01:49:58.196]  A new world order.
[01:49:58.916 --> 01:50:03.037]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:50:03.057 --> 01:50:06.578]  It's known as the Builderberg.
[01:50:06.638 --> 01:50:08.839]  Both their objectives being world domination...
[01:50:09.443 --> 01:50:11.867]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:50:12.608 --> 01:50:19.938]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:50:22.952 --> 01:50:27.933]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:50:28.393 --> 01:50:31.874]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:50:32.254 --> 01:50:34.775]  Bill Burr is making great progress for the world government.
[01:50:34.835 --> 01:50:35.795]  Most people have no idea.
[01:50:35.815 --> 01:50:36.775]  They're not after money.
[01:50:36.795 --> 01:50:37.856]  They have all the money they need.
[01:50:38.076 --> 01:50:38.856]  They're after power.
[01:50:39.056 --> 01:50:39.916]  They're after Athanasia.
[01:50:40.196 --> 01:50:48.378]  Order Endgame on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:50:48.878 --> 01:50:51.259]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:50:51.699 --> 01:50:52.940]  You have been warned.
[01:50:53.741 --> 01:50:58.324]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[01:50:58.724 --> 01:51:01.666]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[01:51:01.986 --> 01:51:04.528]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[01:51:04.908 --> 01:51:09.711]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[01:51:10.091 --> 01:51:15.475]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[01:51:15.775 --> 01:51:18.737]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act,
[01:51:18.917 --> 01:51:20.457]  Which goes into effect May 11, 2008.
[01:51:21.578 --> 01:51:30.580]  Many people believe that this will be the mark of the beast because of the restrictive measures included, which seems to parallel the no buying and selling of Revelations 13, 17.
[01:51:30.920 --> 01:51:37.201]  In Revelations 14, 9, speaking of the mark of the beast, it says, If any man worship the beast, take notice.
[01:51:37.541 --> 01:51:39.161]  It says, worship the beast.
[01:51:39.441 --> 01:51:42.042]  This issue is about worship, not economics.
[01:51:42.322 --> 01:51:42.563]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[01:51:54.301 --> 01:51:54.721]  Attention!
[01:51:54.841 --> 01:51:57.642]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[01:51:57.942 --> 01:52:02.244]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:52:02.564 --> 01:52:03.244]  Listen closely.
[01:52:04.205 --> 01:52:11.367]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product considered to be the single most powerful traditional remedy on Earth.
[01:52:11.648 --> 01:52:20.411]  In fact, medical studies in other countries have been conducted on the astonishing effects this rare mineral-like compound has had on arthritis, obesity, energy, memory, and even reproductive health.
[01:52:21.031 --> 01:52:26.253]  Because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made at this time.
[01:52:26.513 --> 01:52:35.997]  However, it is still legal to own this compound, and right now a very small amount is being made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual offer ever made on radio.
[01:52:36.198 --> 01:52:41.760]  To claim your supply set aside for GCN listeners, simply go to www.blacklistedverb.com.
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:43.702]  That's www.blacklistedherb.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:52:57.998 --> 01:53:00.559]  Final segment with Stuart Nelson.
[01:53:00.999 --> 01:53:02.220]  We really appreciate him joining us.
[01:53:02.260 --> 01:53:06.382]  I promise I'm going to go directly to your calls, Solomon, Judy, Brian, Rick, Robert, and others.
[01:53:06.682 --> 01:53:08.363]  Then I've got some police state news to cover.
[01:53:08.383 --> 01:53:10.524]  Then we're going to have Barry Goldwater Jr.
[01:53:10.704 --> 01:53:15.626]  on the show schedule to talk more about Ron Paul, the big New Hampshire situation coming up tomorrow.
[01:53:17.166 --> 01:53:22.089]  Me and Stuart were just talking about the illegal aliens during the break and how they're all above the law, but then citizens are all scum.
[01:53:22.729 --> 01:53:23.669]  And yeah, I've noticed this.
[01:53:23.709 --> 01:53:26.070]  Yeah, the bus companies, nonstop, they don't even search them.
[01:53:26.330 --> 01:53:27.271]  They don't check papers.
[01:53:27.961 --> 01:53:30.462]  The government has just legalized everybody.
[01:53:30.562 --> 01:53:32.523]  It is a total by fiat joke.
[01:53:33.624 --> 01:53:35.604]  And this is all part of the North American Union.
[01:53:35.644 --> 01:53:36.625]  It's all happening, Stuart.
[01:53:37.065 --> 01:53:41.407]  Yes, I actually took a bus trip over the Christmas holidays to Dallas.
[01:53:41.647 --> 01:53:44.188]  Got on the bus, rode to Dallas.
[01:53:44.708 --> 01:53:47.870]  They made two stops and everything, wherever they stopped.
[01:53:47.950 --> 01:53:48.930]  One was in Hewitt, Texas.
[01:53:48.970 --> 01:53:53.092]  The other one was in southwest Dallas off of Westmoreland and West Davis.
[01:53:53.752 --> 01:53:55.113]  Used to be a high black area.
[01:53:55.626 --> 01:53:56.086]  We're good to go.
[01:54:18.511 --> 01:54:19.071]  It was crazy.
[01:54:19.911 --> 01:54:21.012]  Well, see, that's the deal.
[01:54:21.032 --> 01:54:22.994]  They're super nationalistic illegals.
[01:54:23.154 --> 01:54:24.775]  They openly say this is their country.
[01:54:25.275 --> 01:54:26.796]  It's way more than 30 million.
[01:54:26.896 --> 01:54:29.198]  Half the people under the age of 14 are Hispanic.
[01:54:29.898 --> 01:54:34.382]  And the point is it's a total shift of the country, and the media wants to cover that up.
[01:54:34.402 --> 01:54:37.404]  They've got all these movies coming out about poor immigrants and how sad they are.
[01:54:37.644 --> 01:54:39.045]  The economy's going bankrupted.
[01:54:39.986 --> 01:54:41.306]  People say they work for low prices.
[01:54:41.327 --> 01:54:44.769]  Yeah, but on average they're on triple the welfare of anybody else because they're smart and they're getting it.
[01:54:45.573 --> 01:54:47.133]  And it's just over for the country.
[01:54:47.193 --> 01:54:50.174]  Meanwhile, they're going to run a highway over the Davidians property.
[01:54:50.194 --> 01:55:04.838]  All right, I've got another friend that travels selling janitorial products, and he travels to New Brunswick, San Marcos, Central Texas area, and he said he's witnessed these buses pulling up at these bus stops, and it's just totally unloaded, just illegals, illegals, illegals.
[01:55:04.878 --> 01:55:08.218]  And when I loaded all my gear to get to Dallas, they didn't search.
[01:55:08.259 --> 01:55:09.059]  They didn't look at anything.
[01:55:09.119 --> 01:55:10.219]  I could have put anything on there.
[01:55:11.244 --> 01:55:11.604]  Uh, no.
[01:55:11.624 --> 01:55:17.609]  No, no, security's all about the fat cow Americans, black, white, Hispanic, doesn't matter, who pay the taxes, who are shucked off of.
[01:55:17.929 --> 01:55:23.793]  I mean, cops are all over the news saying, we're told not to stop illegals, we're told not to arrest them, we're told not to care if they don't have insurance.
[01:55:24.073 --> 01:55:24.894]  They're above the law.
[01:55:25.814 --> 01:55:28.897]  They don't have to have IDs to get bank accounts, and we are literal scum.
[01:55:28.957 --> 01:55:29.758]  And we are scum.
[01:55:29.998 --> 01:55:30.719]  We put up with it.
[01:55:30.759 --> 01:55:31.619]  We put up with anything.
[01:55:31.660 --> 01:55:32.460]  We think we're free.
[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:33.021]  Right.
[01:55:33.141 --> 01:55:38.606]  And my God, when the Depression hits, it's just going to be... You watch these illegals riot on cue and burn everything down.
[01:55:38.786 --> 01:55:39.547]  That's going to be a zoo.
[01:55:39.567 --> 01:55:41.889]  That's what they're going to do when we fight back against the New World Order.
[01:55:41.909 --> 01:55:42.770]  They're going to activate them.
[01:55:43.190 --> 01:55:51.077]  Well, I'd like to also remind listeners that you've got several videos about the Waco murders and...
[01:55:52.358 --> 01:55:53.359]  That are terrific.
[01:55:53.679 --> 01:55:56.721]  And that was the single event that woke me up the most.
[01:55:57.581 --> 01:56:01.824]  And Wake Up or Waco, you've got several of them.
[01:56:02.044 --> 01:56:03.365]  And I know that...
[01:56:05.503 --> 01:56:07.205]  I know they've got plans to pave over this thing.
[01:56:07.225 --> 01:56:08.466]  We've got the actual maps.
[01:56:08.786 --> 01:56:11.589]  And we need to review and remember and never forget Waco.
[01:56:11.609 --> 01:56:12.930]  Well, Stuart, we're going to put this out.
[01:56:12.970 --> 01:56:15.052]  People who are in Texas need to contact McLennan County.
[01:56:15.072 --> 01:56:16.113]  They need to contact the legislature.
[01:56:16.133 --> 01:56:22.439]  They need to contact the national media and send them a copy of this video that will be up on Google and places and say, does this not exist?
[01:56:22.499 --> 01:56:27.524]  Are you just going to say as they run bulldozers over it that the bulldozers don't exist?
[01:56:27.544 --> 01:56:29.706]  You know, this is a military tactic they're using.
[01:56:30.426 --> 01:56:32.727]  And, you know, regardless, we built that memorial church.
[01:56:32.767 --> 01:56:34.188]  We're going to fight for it politically.
[01:56:34.228 --> 01:56:35.408]  We're going to expose what's happening.
[01:56:36.009 --> 01:56:38.550]  And it certainly gave the government a black eye to do that.
[01:56:38.790 --> 01:56:43.872]  And remind people that, Alex, you were the one that put the call out.
[01:56:44.892 --> 01:56:46.153]  I don't care about credit, doesn't matter.
[01:56:46.173 --> 01:56:47.753]  Well, still, you put the call out.
[01:56:47.793 --> 01:56:49.754]  George Pulliam, an engineering architect, showed up.
[01:56:49.794 --> 01:56:50.615]  He drew the plans.
[01:56:50.695 --> 01:56:52.235]  He did the engineering on it.
[01:56:52.255 --> 01:56:54.656]  And he died of an infection from surgery a few years ago.
[01:56:54.716 --> 01:56:56.017]  Yeah, he was battling cancer.
[01:56:56.577 --> 01:57:02.221]  And left a widow behind, and a bunch of volunteers showed up over there to put a roof on for her.
[01:57:02.281 --> 01:57:04.403]  Yeah, we put the call out there, but I was unable to attend that.
[01:57:04.783 --> 01:57:05.584]  You helped do that, Stuart.
[01:57:05.844 --> 01:57:08.085]  Stuart Nelson, good to have you here with us, my friend.
[01:57:08.105 --> 01:57:08.306]  Great.
[01:57:08.506 --> 01:57:09.126]  Thanks for the time.
[01:57:09.366 --> 01:57:10.967]  Thanks for spending time with us, my friend.
[01:57:11.448 --> 01:57:12.208]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:12.248 --> 01:57:18.052]  We'll go directly to your calls, and then I'm going to get into some police state news and Barry Goldwater, Jr.
[01:57:19.233 --> 01:57:19.874]  But there you go.
[01:57:19.994 --> 01:57:23.095]  Not just the trans-Texas Napa Superhighway, because it's the same.
[01:57:23.676 --> 01:57:29.639]  I mean, this is one of the trans-Texas arteries that actually is part of the Napa Superhighway 83 highway grid.
[01:57:29.959 --> 01:57:33.101]  But then it's over Mount Carmel and the Branch Davidians.
[01:57:33.882 --> 01:57:39.745]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:57:39.765 --> 01:57:41.526]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:57:50.126 --> 01:57:50.786]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.446 --> 01:57:52.506]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.207 --> 01:57:54.307]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.967 --> 01:57:55.787]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.527 --> 01:57:57.467]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.448 --> 01:58:01.908]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.288 --> 01:58:06.389]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.829 --> 01:58:10.170]  It is the eve of the New Hampshire primaries.
[01:58:10.270 --> 01:58:15.891]  Ron Paul left late last night, flew into Los Angeles, spent a show with Jay Leno.
[01:58:17.179 --> 01:58:17.659]  Very proud.
[01:58:17.699 --> 01:58:19.960]  That broke here on the transmission.
[01:58:19.980 --> 01:58:21.360]  The Sunday edition, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:58:21.380 --> 01:58:25.142]  when we had Jesse Benton, spokesman for the campaign, Ron Paul campaign on.
[01:58:25.402 --> 01:58:32.164]  We got Barry Goldwater Jr., the former congressman's son of the late senator who almost beat LBJ.
[01:58:33.024 --> 01:58:34.165]  Unfortunately didn't.
[01:58:34.205 --> 01:58:35.345]  He was anti-New World Order.
[01:58:35.705 --> 01:58:36.486]  So is his son.
[01:58:36.526 --> 01:58:38.966]  He'll be popping in coming up in about 30 minutes.
[01:58:39.286 --> 01:58:40.867]  Got a bunch of police state news as well.
[01:58:40.987 --> 01:58:42.448]  Solomon in Georgia.
[01:58:42.748 --> 01:58:43.408]  Thanks for holding.
[01:58:43.428 --> 01:58:44.408]  You're on the air, Solomon.
[01:58:44.428 --> 01:58:45.789]  Hi, Alex.
[01:58:46.209 --> 01:58:46.609]  Hello, sir.
[01:58:47.543 --> 01:58:55.111]  First, I want to dovetail what you said about Ron Paul earlier about him needing to be more fired up and not so humble.
[01:58:56.092 --> 01:59:00.597]  But first, Alex, I'd like to say that I'm amazed by how many people in the U.S.
[01:59:00.657 --> 01:59:04.521]  profess to be Christians but don't see their prophetic nature
[01:59:05.612 --> 01:59:17.776]  Well, it's no doubt biblical what's happening, and we have a lot of guests on about that, but I just deal with trying to show people politically what's happening.
[01:59:18.356 --> 01:59:18.816]  Yes, sir.
[01:59:19.536 --> 01:59:20.216]  I agree with you.
[01:59:20.236 --> 01:59:32.600]  I mean, this new world is coming, but I feel like you that we can get maybe a King Hezekiah extension, like 2 Kings chapter 20, but we need a man like Ron Paul.
[01:59:34.218 --> 01:59:37.360]  I like what you were saying earlier about him needing to be more fired up.
[01:59:38.420 --> 01:59:40.382]  America is beyond the need for change.
[01:59:40.402 --> 01:59:42.723]  America needs total reconstruction.
[01:59:44.024 --> 01:59:53.629]  I'm a black man living in Georgia and I have no intention of voting for Barack Obama, especially just because he's black like so many black people that I know are doing.
[01:59:54.339 --> 01:59:57.321]  However, he is a good speaker, and he gets people fired up.
[01:59:57.542 --> 01:59:59.683]  Well, yeah, I have to say it.
[02:00:00.063 --> 02:00:01.324]  He's better than Hillary Clinton.
[02:00:01.625 --> 02:00:02.825]  I mean, she's so evil.
[02:00:02.845 --> 02:00:04.327]  I mean, who knows?
[02:00:04.347 --> 02:00:06.248]  Maybe if he got in, he'd end up being as bad as her.
[02:00:06.288 --> 02:00:10.491]  But, I mean, as far as I know, he doesn't have any murders under his belt, and we know she does.
[02:00:11.912 --> 02:00:17.516]  Now, as far as Ron goes, he's got more real issues to talk to people about.
[02:00:17.716 --> 02:00:19.698]  Yet, at the same time, he comes across so humble.
[02:00:20.157 --> 02:00:24.140]  That people may not see his strength and come to understand what he's really all about.
[02:00:24.160 --> 02:00:31.966]  Because it seems that so many of Americans now are under the false belief that we are at war against some Islamic boogeyman out there.
[02:00:32.306 --> 02:00:35.748]  They've got to see that we've got someone with strength in the White House.
[02:00:36.889 --> 02:00:37.169]  You know?
[02:00:37.810 --> 02:00:40.352]  No, no, I hear you absolutely, Solomon.
[02:00:40.452 --> 02:00:42.033]  I absolutely hear what you're saying.
[02:00:42.688 --> 02:00:46.311]  And, you know, Ron Paul in person, Solomon, is a strong person.
[02:00:46.351 --> 02:00:48.892]  He is sometimes forceful on television.
[02:00:49.313 --> 02:00:57.518]  It's just that when he feels like he's a guest on Jay Leno or a guest on something else with a view, he is very reserved, and frankly, I don't like it.
[02:00:58.159 --> 02:01:02.662]  And I've told the campaign privately, and they go, we know, we've told him, but, you know, he does what he wants.
[02:01:02.702 --> 02:01:06.845]  That's one thing is he's, I don't want to call him pig-headed, but, you know, he is Dr. No.
[02:01:06.885 --> 02:01:08.286]  He does what he thinks is best.
[02:01:08.306 --> 02:01:08.606]  Go ahead.
[02:01:09.571 --> 02:01:15.976]  I would like to see, if any way possible, to have Ron Paul, since he does come on your show on a semi-regular basis.
[02:01:16.036 --> 02:01:17.237]  I've heard him several times.
[02:01:17.778 --> 02:01:23.562]  I don't know how much linking he does to InfoWars and promoting your website and your information.
[02:01:23.983 --> 02:01:30.568]  Maybe someone might think that might be politically incorrect, but a thing that has divided and has confused and has
[02:01:32.095 --> 02:01:41.517]  It is the majority view.
[02:01:41.577 --> 02:01:45.318]  I mean, Daily Paul, which is the biggest Ron Paul site out there, put a link up all weekend.
[02:01:45.338 --> 02:01:49.839]  It's now on their second page about, you know, Alex Jones and Ron Paul.
[02:01:49.919 --> 02:01:54.040]  And almost every post was saying, yeah, they found out about Ron Paul through this show.
[02:01:54.481 --> 02:01:57.161]  But Ron Paul has humbly said that on this show as well.
[02:01:57.821 --> 02:02:00.442]  And he still comes on the show despite national attacks.
[02:02:01.403 --> 02:02:02.964]  And I don't want to make it about me.
[02:02:03.505 --> 02:02:13.956]  I think that he's smart to not forsake us, but he's also smart to not completely jump in bed with us on 9-11 and other things, because still about 30-40% of the public just can't believe that.
[02:02:14.216 --> 02:02:15.718]  You're right, we are the majority.
[02:02:16.698 --> 02:02:24.181]  But unfortunately, it is that weirdo minority out there that still gets out and does the voting.
[02:02:24.542 --> 02:02:25.682]  But good to hear from you, Solomon.
[02:02:25.702 --> 02:02:26.822]  I hope you'll call us back again.
[02:02:26.902 --> 02:02:31.484]  Julie, Brian, Rich, Robert, your calls are all three minutes away.
[02:02:32.125 --> 02:02:33.845]  Stay with us, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:02:33.865 --> 02:02:35.926]  Barry Goldwater, Jr.
[02:02:36.326 --> 02:02:37.947]  is scheduled to join us as well.
[02:02:38.307 --> 02:02:39.628]  Transmission is straight ahead.
[02:02:39.648 --> 02:02:40.068]  Stay with us.

[02:03:47.327 --> 02:03:49.448]  A new world order.
[02:03:50.169 --> 02:03:54.172]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful government.
[02:03:54.192 --> 02:03:57.174]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:03:57.876 --> 02:04:00.117]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:04:00.658 --> 02:04:03.099]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:04:03.839 --> 02:04:11.163]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.

[02:04:27.046 --> 02:04:27.986]  They're not after money.
[02:04:28.006 --> 02:04:29.087]  They have all the money they need.
[02:04:29.307 --> 02:04:30.128]  They're after power.
[02:04:30.168 --> 02:04:30.948]  That's their after news.

[02:05:50.392 --> 02:05:53.014]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:55.149 --> 02:05:56.670]  Let's get back to your calls.
[02:05:57.050 --> 02:05:59.171]  Julie in Wisconsin, thanks for holding.
[02:05:59.451 --> 02:06:00.291]  You're on the air.
[02:06:00.991 --> 02:06:01.411]  Hello.
[02:06:01.431 --> 02:06:01.992]  Hi.
[02:06:02.012 --> 02:06:02.652]  Hi.
[02:06:02.672 --> 02:06:12.856]  I have to tell you, Alex, number one, I got a Christmas present this year that has been my favorite present ever.
[02:06:13.316 --> 02:06:16.477]  And that was a copy of Endgame.
[02:06:17.878 --> 02:06:21.719]  When I saw it, oh my gosh, I was so angered.
[02:06:22.319 --> 02:06:23.480]  I still am angered.
[02:06:24.520 --> 02:06:28.443]  But at the same time, I have to just focus on where we're going.
[02:06:28.463 --> 02:06:34.908]  I've never voted Republican in my life, but I am this time, only because of Ron Paul.
[02:06:35.829 --> 02:06:38.451]  Now, I do stay up on everything.
[02:06:38.471 --> 02:06:44.216]  This is the only thing I hadn't ever known about is when I saw Endgame and what they were doing.
[02:06:44.236 --> 02:06:48.599]  And the problem is, is no one will listen to me.
[02:06:48.619 --> 02:06:51.922]  None of my family, none of my friends.
[02:06:52.873 --> 02:07:00.955]  My daughter, who is going to college and supposed to be extremely smart, oh, Mom, it's just a conspiracy theory.
[02:07:00.975 --> 02:07:06.816]  I said, Amanda, it's not a theory anymore once it's proven, and you can see it proven right on Endgame.
[02:07:07.976 --> 02:07:14.378]  One thing I am waiting for is Terror Storm, because I know that my friend is going to copy that for me.
[02:07:15.718 --> 02:07:18.699]  And the last thing I actually really wanted to say was,
[02:07:19.304 --> 02:07:23.785]  When I heard you talk about the dumbing down of the people... Yes.
[02:07:24.585 --> 02:07:25.585]  Unfortunately, yes.
[02:07:25.705 --> 02:07:34.667]  They've tried to dumb me down ever since I was 13 years old by putting me on serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[02:07:35.187 --> 02:07:48.990]  They have me on a handful of drugs right now, and there's nothing I can do about it right now because my body is totally, you know, I'm addicted to
[02:07:49.633 --> 02:07:50.273]  Through my body.
[02:07:50.754 --> 02:07:52.995]  Oh, they're incredibly addictive.
[02:07:53.035 --> 02:07:58.579]  Now, they admit now that those are also linked to diabetes, but there are ways to get off.
[02:07:58.599 --> 02:08:03.522]  You just have to get off very, very slowly over a period of months if you've been on them for years.
[02:08:03.822 --> 02:08:05.043]  How many years have you been on these?
[02:08:05.303 --> 02:08:06.644]  Since I was 14, and I'm 50.
[02:08:07.004 --> 02:08:12.508]  Yeah, because they came out with these... In the 70s, you said, right?
[02:08:12.688 --> 02:08:13.308]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:08:13.568 --> 02:08:15.169]  Yep, I was, well, actually about 76.
[02:08:15.209 --> 02:08:17.111]  75 and 76 was when I first was put on them.
[02:08:19.795 --> 02:08:26.980]  You know, I was supposedly uncontrollable, and that's what they put me in the hospital for.
[02:08:27.020 --> 02:08:36.686]  Well, children are always, and young people are always, I mean, are always getting in trouble, are always doing things, and now they say it's a big crisis, and they up the crisis by sending them to the doctors.
[02:08:37.086 --> 02:08:39.368]  But expanding on that earlier point,
[02:08:40.346 --> 02:08:46.588]  Somebody gave you a copy of Endgame, then the tumblers all clicked into position, and then things were clearer.
[02:08:46.608 --> 02:08:47.348]  Yes!
[02:08:47.769 --> 02:08:48.849]  And that's exactly it.
[02:08:48.989 --> 02:08:57.732]  And now, earlier I went and signed up for the Ron Paul committee, and I'm hoping that I can work for him in my little town of Wisconsin.
[02:08:58.682 --> 02:09:02.845]  And get everybody, you know, I mean, I have friends in the media.
[02:09:02.925 --> 02:09:03.905]  I have friends here and there.
[02:09:03.925 --> 02:09:06.007]  I just need people to listen.
[02:09:06.287 --> 02:09:08.008]  My own family doesn't listen to me.
[02:09:08.028 --> 02:09:08.788]  They think I'm nuts.
[02:09:08.969 --> 02:09:12.991]  Well, the key here is, Julian, I appreciate your call, is give them the video.
[02:09:13.071 --> 02:09:14.792]  Make a copy of the copy you were given.
[02:09:15.473 --> 02:09:15.793]  Okay?
[02:09:15.813 --> 02:09:18.995]  Don't worry about buying it from Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:09:19.275 --> 02:09:19.995]  The power.
[02:09:20.035 --> 02:09:21.236]  I want my films to be seen.
[02:09:21.636 --> 02:09:22.557]  I want to have an effect.
[02:09:23.214 --> 02:09:23.935]  That's what I want.
[02:09:23.975 --> 02:09:26.237]  That's the currency I'm into is beating these people.
[02:09:26.598 --> 02:09:30.662]  And the power is you making copies and telling others to make copies.
[02:09:31.383 --> 02:09:40.173]  And with these digitals, you can just make copy after copy after copy after copy after copy after copy after copy and you get some quality loss over time depending on how you copy them, but
[02:09:41.448 --> 02:09:44.230]  Used to with VHS, by four or five copies, they looked really bad.
[02:09:44.631 --> 02:09:46.212]  We still got millions of them out there.
[02:09:46.552 --> 02:09:49.314]  A thousand videos with people making copies can turn into a million.
[02:09:49.755 --> 02:09:51.896]  You know, you take a video and make five copies.
[02:09:52.377 --> 02:09:53.738]  Two of the people you give it to make copies.
[02:09:53.758 --> 02:09:55.019]  They make ten copies.
[02:09:55.459 --> 02:09:57.661]  Five of those people make, you know, then that's 20 copies.
[02:09:57.721 --> 02:09:59.082]  And it's just on and on and on.
[02:09:59.603 --> 02:10:01.744]  Well, with the DVDs, just go crazy with them.
[02:10:03.246 --> 02:10:05.507]  Go get a prisonplanet.tv membership.
[02:10:05.527 --> 02:10:08.149]  Download Terror Storm, Endgame, all my films.
[02:10:08.209 --> 02:10:09.190]  It's super high quality.
[02:10:09.230 --> 02:10:09.991]  Burn them to death.
[02:10:10.836 --> 02:10:12.638]  It's not as good as the DVD, but it's close.
[02:10:12.678 --> 02:10:13.558]  And give those to people.
[02:10:14.299 --> 02:10:16.140]  Or give them a prisonplanet.tv membership.
[02:10:16.180 --> 02:10:18.222]  I mean, we need you, the listeners, to become activists.
[02:10:18.262 --> 02:10:19.123]  I know most of you are.
[02:10:19.463 --> 02:10:26.329]  But if you haven't, I mean, if you haven't gone out and registered to vote for Ron Paul, ensure there's fraud and corruption.
[02:10:26.589 --> 02:10:27.730]  The point is, we're going to expose it.
[02:10:27.750 --> 02:10:28.551]  We're going to point it out.
[02:10:28.571 --> 02:10:30.853]  We're going to have a good showing for Ron Paul.
[02:10:30.873 --> 02:10:31.993]  We're going to wake more people up.
[02:10:32.013 --> 02:10:33.835]  We're going to move this movement forward.
[02:10:35.116 --> 02:10:37.118]  We certainly just can't lay down and die.
[02:10:37.818 --> 02:10:39.840]  And Ron Paul's only one venue in this fight.
[02:10:41.039 --> 02:10:49.424]  All the people that have been woken up by Ron Paul, whether he wins, loses, or draws, or whatever happens, they're now going to look for other movements to be involved in.
[02:10:49.444 --> 02:10:56.468]  They're going to still be friends, these meet-up groups, thousands of them, thousands in some major cities apiece, hundreds of thousands together.
[02:10:56.508 --> 02:11:00.711]  They're going to form the core of the next big wave against the New World Order.
[02:11:02.250 --> 02:11:04.471]  You know, the United Nations tries to come into the U.S.
[02:11:04.511 --> 02:11:23.557]  and hand out free textbooks and comic books and pay for tuition and tries to hire the best and brightest minds out of high school and tries to recruit people for community propaganda work and to go out and be kind of a rent-a-mob and have the look of grassroots with their non-governmental organizations and it falls on its face everywhere.
[02:11:25.896 --> 02:11:32.943]  They're trying that with AmeriCorps and SecureCorps and FEMA in their recruiting and trying to hire and Homeland Security out of the high schools.
[02:11:34.139 --> 02:11:38.422]  Now, they're offering full tuitions there, so they are having some effect, and that's a big crisis point.
[02:11:38.762 --> 02:11:40.643]  But our revolution is grassroots.
[02:11:40.663 --> 02:11:41.784]  It isn't driven off money.
[02:11:41.804 --> 02:11:43.625]  It isn't driven off command and control.
[02:11:43.665 --> 02:11:44.966]  It isn't driven off central planning.
[02:11:45.466 --> 02:11:46.847]  And I'm seeing a bloom.
[02:11:47.308 --> 02:11:56.914]  I'm seeing an explosive growth right now that is going to continue to ripple effect and cause other explosions of awakening and expansion and movements.
[02:11:57.629 --> 02:12:00.090]  And let me tell you, the New World Order is in a lot of trouble.
[02:12:00.490 --> 02:12:01.850]  Doesn't mean things are going to be comfortable.
[02:12:01.870 --> 02:12:04.291]  Doesn't mean we're not running into rocky ground.
[02:12:04.311 --> 02:12:05.331]  They've brought down the borders.
[02:12:05.351 --> 02:12:07.092]  They've flooded us with third world populations.
[02:12:07.132 --> 02:12:08.512]  They've destroyed our dollar.
[02:12:08.532 --> 02:12:09.872]  They've dumbed down most of the public.
[02:12:09.892 --> 02:12:11.413]  They've militarized the police.
[02:12:11.453 --> 02:12:14.234]  They've shipped in narcotics and put our people in prison.
[02:12:14.774 --> 02:12:18.115]  And we're in deep shape, but we're in bad shape.
[02:12:18.175 --> 02:12:18.915]  We're in deep trouble.
[02:12:19.495 --> 02:12:23.396]  But still, there's a lot of good things happening.
[02:12:25.097 --> 02:12:31.042]  The country basically got stabbed 14 or 15 times, but it finally woke up and realized it was being stabbed, and it's starting to fight back.
[02:12:34.425 --> 02:12:36.247]  And we can recruit a lot of these illegal aliens.
[02:12:37.968 --> 02:12:39.590]  There's a lot of things we've got to do, folks.
[02:12:39.630 --> 02:12:43.153]  We're in deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep trouble.
[02:12:43.874 --> 02:12:44.854]  And this is only the beginning.
[02:12:45.515 --> 02:12:48.998]  By the way, gold is still at above $8.65 right now.
[02:12:49.539 --> 02:12:51.660]  I saw a lie in the Associated Press Friday.
[02:12:51.680 --> 02:12:52.261]  I couldn't believe it.
[02:12:53.180 --> 02:12:55.722]  They said, gold still has not reached its record of 875.
[02:12:58.024 --> 02:13:04.029]  And then I went, wait a minute, I happen to know that gold never went above 850 since 1980, and now broke that last week.
[02:13:04.069 --> 02:13:08.352]  And I went and looked at AP, Reuters, Wikipedia, all said 850.
[02:13:09.533 --> 02:13:10.273]  Kitco said 850.
[02:13:10.574 --> 02:13:16.018]  I called Ted Anderson, who was in the gold business in 1980, and he said, yeah, I know, 850 is the record.
[02:13:17.370 --> 02:13:22.512]  And AP didn't retract that and is just lying to say the record hasn't been reached.
[02:13:22.612 --> 02:13:24.572]  I mean, we're talking about incredible lies.
[02:13:26.473 --> 02:13:30.114]  Okay, Brian in... Where are you calling from, Brian?
[02:13:31.534 --> 02:13:32.294]  Indiana, Alex.
[02:13:32.314 --> 02:13:33.775]  We love you up here in northern Indiana.
[02:13:33.815 --> 02:13:34.975]  Well, we love you too up there.
[02:13:35.035 --> 02:13:35.655]  What's on your mind?
[02:13:36.475 --> 02:13:38.216]  Yeah, I wanted to tell you, it was interesting.
[02:13:38.536 --> 02:13:45.798]  Today on the Howard Stern Show, about like 7.30, 7.40, he actually said he thought Ron Paul was fantastic.
[02:13:46.557 --> 02:13:49.740]  And he doesn't understand why there's not enough media coverage of him.
[02:13:49.780 --> 02:13:55.765]  And I couldn't believe that from a guy who in 2004 was endorsing Kerry and telling everybody to go vote for Kerry.
[02:13:56.425 --> 02:13:58.747]  Well, there's a bandwagon effect.
[02:13:58.767 --> 02:14:07.875]  I mean, when Ron Paul gets the main first segment on Jay Leno tonight, you see, again, we couldn't have hoped for this five years ago.
[02:14:07.995 --> 02:14:09.876]  Now everybody's waking up to the Federal Reserve.
[02:14:10.317 --> 02:14:14.320]  Being a libertarian, being a truth seeker is totally fashionable.
[02:14:15.029 --> 02:14:18.172]  And guess what listenership is at the heart of this explosion?
[02:14:18.412 --> 02:14:18.672]  You.
[02:14:18.992 --> 02:14:19.273]  You.
[02:14:19.593 --> 02:14:20.353]  I don't get the credit.
[02:14:20.494 --> 02:14:21.194]  You get it, buddy.
[02:14:21.534 --> 02:14:22.395]  You get it, Brian.
[02:14:23.936 --> 02:14:24.377]  Thank you.
[02:14:24.457 --> 02:14:28.740]  Yeah, I just... Sirius Radio has like over 7 million subscriptions.
[02:14:28.760 --> 02:14:37.928]  If anybody from the campaign is listening, if we could get Ron Paul to go on the show, actually, I think that would hit a whole different demographic of people.
[02:14:37.968 --> 02:14:42.852]  We could control, in a way, the East Coast primaries and caucuses like for...
[02:14:43.519 --> 02:14:45.120]  To oppose Romney and Giuliani.
[02:14:45.180 --> 02:14:47.783]  I think that we could really head them off right there.
[02:14:48.263 --> 02:14:53.247]  Well, that is a niche audience that really loves Stern, and that's certainly good.
[02:14:53.287 --> 02:14:56.009]  But, I mean, Leno's got about 40 million viewers.
[02:14:56.650 --> 02:14:59.312]  It's one of the few places that still has big audiences.
[02:14:59.332 --> 02:15:02.835]  I mean, the nightly news is down to 15 mil per show.
[02:15:04.256 --> 02:15:11.242]  The only thing that's got big audiences is a couple of late shows and things like Coast to Coast AM, Rush Limbaugh.
[02:15:11.782 --> 02:15:12.343]  That's about it.
[02:15:13.442 --> 02:15:14.664]  Can I ask you one more thing, Alex?
[02:15:14.704 --> 02:15:14.944]  Sure.
[02:15:16.006 --> 02:15:17.748]  What's up with this Tucker Carlson?
[02:15:17.768 --> 02:15:21.454]  It seems he really supports Ron Paul in some aspects.
[02:15:21.494 --> 02:15:23.116]  But then he supports the neocon agenda.
[02:15:23.136 --> 02:15:25.039]  See, he saw the bandwagon a long time ago.
[02:15:25.700 --> 02:15:29.245]  And so, Glenn Beck, all of them have to, meal boards.
[02:15:30.111 --> 02:15:30.471]  We're good to go.
[02:16:01.035 --> 02:16:01.675]  Makes no sense.
[02:16:02.036 --> 02:16:02.916]  Hey, I appreciate your call.
[02:16:02.956 --> 02:16:03.897]  Good to hear from you, Brian.
[02:16:04.937 --> 02:16:07.058]  Rich in New Hampshire, Battleground State.
[02:16:07.098 --> 02:16:07.659]  Welcome, Rich.
[02:16:08.359 --> 02:16:09.320]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:16:09.560 --> 02:16:09.840]  Hi.
[02:16:10.700 --> 02:16:13.442]  I happen to notice something in my perusals of the day.
[02:16:13.462 --> 02:16:18.785]  It seems that Frank Luntz got caught out by some people on YouTube and
[02:16:19.284 --> 02:16:21.385]  What I call Quizzling Republic, Free Republic.
[02:16:21.706 --> 02:16:27.349]  Yeah, it's up on prisonplanet.com and Ron Paul War Room right now.
[02:16:27.729 --> 02:16:31.031]  Frank Luntz, one of the top pollsters and focus group guys.
[02:16:31.312 --> 02:16:32.492]  Focus group will be brand new.
[02:16:32.512 --> 02:16:33.353]  Brought in that one day.
[02:16:33.653 --> 02:16:39.737]  And it turns out, not just one guy, I noticed more, in the audience, they even place him with the camera in the same spot.
[02:16:40.517 --> 02:16:40.778]  Right.
[02:16:40.798 --> 02:16:42.819]  That's exactly what's going on.
[02:16:42.859 --> 02:16:46.182]  And the more that we use sites like yours and the Internet and other places...
[02:17:05.638 --> 02:17:08.607]  To be able to counter what they're pulling.
[02:17:08.868 --> 02:17:09.670]  I'm going to stop you.
[02:17:09.730 --> 02:17:11.174]  I'm going to stop you and hold you over.
[02:17:11.275 --> 02:17:11.897]  It is not me.
[02:17:13.087 --> 02:17:13.727]  It is you.
[02:17:13.747 --> 02:17:15.908]  It is listeners that went out.
[02:17:16.548 --> 02:17:18.989]  It is Ron Paul supporters that caught Frank Luntz.
[02:17:19.530 --> 02:17:22.691]  It is Ron Paul supporters that took that new Hitler movie that's excellent.
[02:17:22.711 --> 02:17:23.131]  I forget the name.
[02:17:23.171 --> 02:17:24.051]  I saw it two years ago.
[02:17:24.472 --> 02:17:27.193]  And put text over it like it was Fox News.
[02:17:27.253 --> 02:17:29.934]  And now it's got 200,000 views in 24 hours.
[02:17:30.394 --> 02:17:31.174]  It is you.
[02:17:31.575 --> 02:17:35.436]  You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you.
[02:17:36.016 --> 02:17:40.058]  And I want you to go post all the stuff you're doing at ronpaulwarren.com.
[02:17:40.618 --> 02:17:41.298]  Stay there, Rich.
[02:17:41.318 --> 02:17:42.459]  I want to hear from you from New Hampshire.
[02:17:45.680 --> 02:17:49.386]  The IRS garnished my wages, put a lien on our home, and levied our bank accounts.
[02:17:49.566 --> 02:17:50.888]  I had no idea what to do.
[02:17:51.188 --> 02:17:53.251]  Then my attorney told me about Assured Tax Relief.
[02:17:53.492 --> 02:17:55.435]  Calling them was the best thing I've ever done.
[02:17:55.675 --> 02:17:58.639]  They got us a settlement with the IRS that we could manage.
[02:17:58.840 --> 02:18:01.504]  Call Assured Tax Relief now for a free consultation.
[02:18:01.664 --> 02:18:02.084]  1-800-203-7479.

[02:18:14.494 --> 02:18:18.577]  The IRS is offering you a one-time opportunity to pay your debt for much less than you owe.
[02:18:18.937 --> 02:18:20.438]  Call Assured Tax Relief now.
[02:18:20.459 --> 02:18:20.859]  1-800-203-7479.
[02:18:20.879 --> 02:18:27.304]  Assured Tax Relief got the IRS to accept just a fraction of what we owed.
[02:18:27.544 --> 02:18:28.785]  Thanks, Assured Tax Relief.
[02:18:29.005 --> 02:18:34.732]  Assured Tax Relief's accountants, attorneys, and tax preparers are waiting to help you settle your debt for just pennies on the dollar.

[02:18:39.598 --> 02:18:39.879]  That's 1-800-203-7479.
[02:18:45.959 --> 02:18:58.704]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in Internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[02:18:59.104 --> 02:19:05.827]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[02:19:06.167 --> 02:19:06.627]  We're good to go.
[02:19:37.088 --> 02:19:39.350]  We're in a no-holds-barred information war.
[02:19:39.731 --> 02:19:45.036]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[02:19:46.059 --> 02:19:52.061]  How would you like to have a tool to use at home that you can use anytime that helps reduce back pain, sciatica, hip pain, and more?
[02:19:52.281 --> 02:19:55.042]  A tool that helps relieve the pain and doesn't just treat the symptoms.
[02:19:55.282 --> 02:19:57.563]  You need the Sacro Wedgie Sacral Stabilizer.
[02:19:57.843 --> 02:20:01.425]  One satisfied user states, I don't believe in gadgets, but this is a miracle.
[02:20:01.585 --> 02:20:02.385]  Yes, that's right.
[02:20:02.445 --> 02:20:07.447]  Just relax 20 minutes daily or when needed to help correct the muscle imbalance that creates many of these symptoms.
[02:20:07.647 --> 02:20:11.328]  Gravity does the work with the Sacro Wedgie under the sacrum and support under your neck.
[02:20:11.528 --> 02:20:13.549]  Help correct posture to help relieve the pain.
[02:20:13.789 --> 02:20:15.630]  Better balance equals fewer problems.
[02:20:15.790 --> 02:20:18.871]  You can even sit on the Sacro Wedgie at the computer or while traveling.
[02:20:18.971 --> 02:20:24.333]  This device has been helping people for the past 15 years, yet the cost is still just $29.95.
[02:20:24.554 --> 02:20:27.615]  Finally, something available that really relieves those stubborn aches and pains.

[02:20:46.883 --> 02:20:49.424]  Ladies and gentlemen, Abigail's Addict.

[02:21:40.862 --> 02:21:43.163]  By the way, we've been studying these internal trans-Texas synaptic superhighway maps.
[02:21:43.183 --> 02:21:44.004]  They've even got the TXU...
[02:22:07.558 --> 02:22:15.942]  Railroads, they're going to use our tax dollars to build just to bring coal to the Bilderberg-owned power plants that supply five states.
[02:22:16.082 --> 02:22:18.964]  I mean, it's just a complete handover of the entire infrastructure.
[02:22:19.524 --> 02:22:22.225]  Texas is going to have more people than California and New York soon.
[02:22:22.265 --> 02:22:25.247]  It's the second most populated state gaining on California.
[02:22:25.887 --> 02:22:26.807]  Everybody's moving here.
[02:22:27.748 --> 02:22:28.248]  They know that.
[02:22:28.288 --> 02:22:30.329]  They're just handing the entire state over for nothing.
[02:22:31.938 --> 02:22:36.079]  Just a few million to this politician, a few million to that, and they just go, hey, it's all yours, take it.
[02:22:36.099 --> 02:22:41.100]  We got men with machine guns and black uniforms that'll go gun down anybody that doesn't get out of our way.
[02:22:41.140 --> 02:22:43.680]  And they say, hi, Hitler, and off to the races.
[02:22:45.460 --> 02:22:47.321]  It's good to be a slave, isn't it?
[02:22:48.241 --> 02:22:50.181]  Let's go back to Rick in New Hampshire.
[02:22:50.201 --> 02:22:50.901]  You were making a point.
[02:22:50.941 --> 02:22:51.441]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:22:52.142 --> 02:22:53.482]  Yeah, just a quick thing.
[02:22:54.502 --> 02:22:56.082]  I'm not sure if it's the one you were actually talking about.
[02:22:56.502 --> 02:22:57.462]  I'm up on YouTube.
[02:22:57.542 --> 02:23:00.143]  It's Ron Paul, Fox News, Internal Meeting is the one with the...
[02:23:00.785 --> 02:23:04.746]  It looks like Alex Guinness is Hitler and they have the... It's not Alex Guinness is Hitler.
[02:23:04.806 --> 02:23:08.267]  It's like... It was called Hitler's Bunker or Hitler's Last Hours.
[02:23:08.287 --> 02:23:09.148]  It's a German film.
[02:23:09.188 --> 02:23:10.768]  I saw it two years ago in theaters.
[02:23:11.068 --> 02:23:11.828]  I haven't actually seen this.
[02:23:11.848 --> 02:23:13.189]  That would be interesting to look for.
[02:23:13.449 --> 02:23:22.112]  But they do have text over it and Hitler is Rupert Murdoch and supposedly everybody standing in front of him is like Hannity and O'Reilly and such.
[02:23:22.132 --> 02:23:22.932]  It's actually kind of funny.
[02:23:23.752 --> 02:23:26.373]  The point I was making, though, is that the more...
[02:23:27.348 --> 02:23:36.474]  Like you said, it's us, but you actually are also providing the focal point where people can go and find the information if they don't have the ability to search on the web themselves.
[02:23:36.834 --> 02:23:51.683]  But the more that this information gets out and counters what the official explanations are, the more they're going to come down on the net and the more they're going to crack down on people and the more they're going to be demanding that everything be controlled through the government for our security's sake.
[02:23:51.703 --> 02:23:55.105]  And everybody seems to have forgotten they're Franklin, they're Adams, they're Jefferson.
[02:23:55.843 --> 02:24:00.764]  And hopefully enough people wake up in time to be able to stop this.
[02:24:01.824 --> 02:24:02.364]  Absolutely.
[02:24:02.444 --> 02:24:04.385]  I hear you, my friend, and I appreciate your call.
[02:24:05.205 --> 02:24:07.865]  Let's go ahead and, by the way, Barry Goldwater Jr.
[02:24:07.925 --> 02:24:08.626]  is coming up.
[02:24:08.926 --> 02:24:12.066]  Let's go ahead and talk to Robert in South Dakota.
[02:24:12.106 --> 02:24:12.866]  Robert, go ahead.
[02:24:12.886 --> 02:24:14.027]  Hi, Alex.
[02:24:14.107 --> 02:24:15.267]  It's Robert in San Diego.
[02:24:16.007 --> 02:24:17.787]  Hey, that's close enough.
[02:24:18.047 --> 02:24:18.548]  That's close.
[02:24:18.728 --> 02:24:25.349]  Hey, I want to thank you and especially your wife and kids for the sacrifice they make, you know, supporting you for all you do, too.
[02:24:27.052 --> 02:24:31.074]  I missed the day when you said predictions for the new year.
[02:24:31.154 --> 02:24:34.976]  I think we're going to see more chemtrails in our skies than ever before.
[02:24:35.056 --> 02:24:35.936]  I've already seen that.
[02:24:35.956 --> 02:24:36.897]  I don't know what's going on.
[02:24:37.177 --> 02:24:41.198]  Yeah, on January 2nd over San Diego, it was so thick.
[02:24:43.299 --> 02:24:44.400]  Sir, we didn't cut you off.
[02:24:44.440 --> 02:24:44.840]  Are you there?
[02:24:46.641 --> 02:24:49.202]  You know, it's going to help the GM food destroy our bodies faster.
[02:24:49.222 --> 02:24:51.683]  I just think that's something I've been following on the Jeff Rinshow.
[02:24:52.256 --> 02:24:53.677]  There's no GMO food.
[02:24:53.717 --> 02:24:55.238]  There's no NAFTA highway.
[02:24:55.258 --> 02:24:57.780]  Schwarzenegger didn't say he loves Hitler.
[02:24:57.820 --> 02:24:58.440]  Everything's fine.
[02:24:59.901 --> 02:25:11.108]  Hey, last night on the Sunday night lineup for the cartoon shows, they had a new Simpsons and a family guy both doing an election series where both of them said the exact same thing.
[02:25:11.389 --> 02:25:13.370]  The audience was like, why should we vote for you?
[02:25:13.410 --> 02:25:15.591]  And they just said, 9-11, terrorists are going to get you.
[02:25:15.732 --> 02:25:17.473]  And they all said, oh, yes, that's right, we forgot.
[02:25:17.733 --> 02:25:19.294]  And they were making a big joke of it, so...
[02:25:19.833 --> 02:25:23.316]  Even pop culture is escaping the New World Order's attention there.
[02:25:23.937 --> 02:25:26.939]  Yeah, well, Fox has to do that just to maintain viewers.
[02:25:27.280 --> 02:25:29.482]  And it's just all part of their throwing it in our face.
[02:25:30.142 --> 02:25:31.984]  And then this morning, of course, you already brought it up.
[02:25:32.424 --> 02:25:33.425]  It was so obvious.
[02:25:33.545 --> 02:25:35.627]  Al-Qaeda is threatening Bush.
[02:25:35.687 --> 02:25:40.552]  And Iran is standing up to the blockade they put around them for our security.
[02:25:40.652 --> 02:25:41.993]  Oh, my God, we're all going to get it.
[02:25:42.654 --> 02:25:43.614]  And that's another point.
[02:25:43.674 --> 02:25:43.915]  And then...
[02:25:45.578 --> 02:25:52.960]  You can totally watch that and then see the polling numbers come out, and then you can totally predict what the propaganda is going to be on Monday morning.
[02:25:53.020 --> 02:25:54.561]  Oh, I wouldn't be surprised.
[02:25:54.581 --> 02:25:59.942]  They also have inaugural bombings right after Blair gets re-elected or right after Brown gets re-elected.
[02:25:59.962 --> 02:26:09.385]  There's a bombing, and it's always when they're having some meeting, right as they give a speech about terrorism, stuff's blown up, and then Adam Gadon points out, my dad runs, grandpa runs ADL.
[02:26:09.745 --> 02:26:10.705]  I'm going to get you.
[02:26:10.785 --> 02:26:13.026]  I mean, how obvious does it have to get?
[02:26:13.046 --> 02:26:14.166]  It's ridiculous.
[02:26:14.739 --> 02:26:19.140]  And since last Thursday, I have not seen any major news story on Ron Paul.
[02:26:19.660 --> 02:26:23.041]  I mean, he's kicking their butt, and they just hold their nose, close their eyes.
[02:26:23.701 --> 02:26:24.161]  That's right.
[02:26:24.221 --> 02:26:32.163]  I type Ron Paul into Google four or five times a day in Google News, and now there's literally about 10% of what there was a few weeks ago.
[02:26:32.183 --> 02:26:38.384]  Or when a major paper covers it, it's on their Internet only, only on the blog, not in the newspaper.
[02:26:39.315 --> 02:26:57.444]  See, the New World Order right now is living off of, God love them, people above 70 or so that watch Fox News, only get their news from the paper, and they still vote, but that's that 20% of the population that will believe anything they say, and they're there having no idea they're under mind control, no idea the flicker rates of the television.
[02:26:57.744 --> 02:26:59.225]  I mean, they're like babes of the slaughter.
[02:27:00.313 --> 02:27:02.794]  They still think it's in the 1950s, mom and apple pie.
[02:27:03.294 --> 02:27:05.394]  And that's who the dominant media targets.
[02:27:05.414 --> 02:27:06.235]  It's who they poll.
[02:27:06.255 --> 02:27:07.315]  It's who they're counting on.
[02:27:07.355 --> 02:27:07.975]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:27:08.415 --> 02:27:16.477]  No, I wanted to say one last thing, which is the good news, which is if you're out there listening and you think the new rule of order can't be stopped, just keep this in mind.
[02:27:16.857 --> 02:27:17.818]  They're a cyclops.
[02:27:17.998 --> 02:27:19.618]  They have one all-seeing eye.
[02:27:19.778 --> 02:27:21.398]  That means they have no depth perception.
[02:27:21.438 --> 02:27:23.319]  They never see the truth coming after them.
[02:27:23.757 --> 02:27:28.301]  You know, just like the devil would have never killed Christ on the cross if he would have known what was going to happen.
[02:27:28.541 --> 02:27:29.522]  Well, it's more than that.
[02:27:29.582 --> 02:27:30.843]  They can't help their nature.
[02:27:30.963 --> 02:27:32.424]  They've got to do what they've got to do.
[02:27:32.744 --> 02:27:34.465]  Kill, steal, and destroy.
[02:27:36.067 --> 02:27:36.987]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.428 --> 02:27:39.049]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.069 --> 02:27:42.692]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.919 --> 02:27:46.800]  Storable food.
[02:27:47.020 --> 02:27:47.880]  Storable food.
[02:27:48.041 --> 02:27:52.083]  HempUSA.org has an inexpensive, nutritionally dense, high-frequency food.
[02:27:52.243 --> 02:28:07.413]  Hemp, known around the world, will boost your immune system and increase energy levels, detoxifies the body and reduces junk food cravings, burns fat and builds muscle, and is easy to digest, non-allergenic and gluten-free, can be made into smoothies, breads, muffins, pancakes, cookies, you name it.
[02:28:07.594 --> 02:28:10.255]  The entire planet should make this a staple food in their diet.
[02:28:10.415 --> 02:28:14.198]  The seeds will scrape the colon wall, the powder will feed the body vital minerals,
[02:28:15.759 --> 02:28:18.500]  And remember, let your food be your medicine, and your medicine be your food.
[02:28:45.828 --> 02:28:46.328]  Hi, Ken.
[02:28:46.368 --> 02:28:47.148]  It's Judy again.
[02:28:47.168 --> 02:28:51.690]  I just wanted to call you back and let you know how thankful Mike and I are for your working with us.
[02:28:51.850 --> 02:28:54.991]  You know the sun oven we ordered from you on KenSolar.com?
[02:28:55.211 --> 02:28:57.091]  It cooks all of our food and then some.
[02:28:57.372 --> 02:28:59.432]  Plus, we just sold the old gas barbecue.
[02:28:59.632 --> 02:29:05.734]  Also, the solar power generator reduced our electric bill just like you said it would, and it's powering my whole studio right now.
[02:29:05.934 --> 02:29:11.216]  We don't have to worry about our food going bad or surviving the outages anymore, either of which is huge.
[02:29:11.496 --> 02:29:14.357]  Well, Ken, I'll cut this one short for now, and thanks again.
[02:29:14.477 --> 02:29:15.397]  Go, Ken Solar!
[02:29:16.698 --> 02:29:18.219]  Get the best of both worlds.

[02:29:23.923 --> 02:29:25.324]  Perfect for hurricane seasons.
[02:29:25.624 --> 02:29:29.126]  No long gas lines, no fumes, and no noise.
[02:29:29.847 --> 02:29:32.509]  Lower your electric bill and be prepared year-round.

[02:29:35.731 --> 02:29:39.834]  See the complete solar power generator kit at KenSolar.com.
[02:29:39.994 --> 02:29:43.836]  Order your solar power generator from Ken's website at KenSolar.com.
[02:29:45.464 --> 02:29:45.744]  Thank you.
[02:30:05.959 --> 02:30:06.659]  We're good to go.
[02:30:06.679 --> 02:30:06.940]  I think?
[02:30:35.712 --> 02:30:37.815]  I don't have to tell you things are bad.
[02:30:37.855 --> 02:30:39.757]  Everybody knows things are bad.
[02:30:39.777 --> 02:30:41.279]  It's a depression.
[02:30:41.299 --> 02:30:44.182]  Everybody's out of work or scared of losing their job.
[02:30:56.147 --> 02:30:57.669]  The dollar buys a nickel's worth.
[02:30:58.129 --> 02:30:59.151]  Banks are going bust.
[02:30:59.231 --> 02:31:01.153]  Shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter.
[02:31:01.794 --> 02:31:03.376]  Punks are running wild in the street.
[02:31:03.416 --> 02:31:05.999]  There's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do and there's no end to it.
[02:31:07.641 --> 02:31:10.024]  We know the air is unfit to breathe.
[02:31:10.164 --> 02:31:11.546]  Our food is unfit to eat.
[02:31:12.327 --> 02:31:20.873]  We sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had 15 homicides and 63 violent crimes, as if that's the way it's supposed to be.
[02:31:21.133 --> 02:31:23.194]  We know things are bad, worse than bad.
[02:31:23.795 --> 02:31:24.535]  They're crazy.
[02:31:24.755 --> 02:31:27.757]  It's like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don't go out anymore.
[02:31:28.138 --> 02:31:35.062]  We sit in the house, and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller, and all we say is, please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms.
[02:31:35.102 --> 02:31:39.445]  Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-built radios, and I won't say anything.
[02:31:39.645 --> 02:31:40.526]  Just leave us alone.
[02:31:40.726 --> 02:31:42.047]  Well, I'm not going to leave you alone.
[02:31:42.948 --> 02:31:44.129]  I want you to get mad.
[02:31:45.290 --> 02:31:46.211]  I don't want you to protest.
[02:31:46.291 --> 02:31:47.352]  I don't want you to riot.
[02:31:47.372 --> 02:31:50.315]  I don't want you to write to your congressman because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write.
[02:31:50.695 --> 02:31:54.999]  I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the streets.
[02:31:55.340 --> 02:31:57.842]  All I know is that first, you've got to get mad.
[02:31:58.303 --> 02:32:00.204]  You've got to say, I'm a human being.
[02:32:00.445 --> 02:32:01.666]  My life has value.
[02:32:03.267 --> 02:32:03.668]  I want you...
[02:32:04.634 --> 02:32:06.736]  I want you to get up now.
[02:32:06.756 --> 02:32:08.778]  I want all of you to get up out of your chairs.
[02:32:10.099 --> 02:32:20.509]  I want you to get up right now and go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell, I'm as tired as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!
[02:32:21.690 --> 02:32:23.112]  I want you to get up right now.
[02:32:23.832 --> 02:32:28.197]  Get up, go to your windows, open them and stick your head out and yell,
[02:32:30.702 --> 02:32:34.264]  I'm as bad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!
[02:32:42.288 --> 02:32:46.510]  I'm as bad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!
[02:32:50.072 --> 02:32:52.133]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're back live.
[02:32:52.153 --> 02:32:54.694]  Got about 25 minutes left in transmission.
[02:32:57.796 --> 02:32:59.737]  Barry Goldwater, Senator Barry Goldwater.
[02:33:00.649 --> 02:33:03.475]  Almost won the presidency when he went into New Hampshire.
[02:33:03.495 --> 02:33:04.837]  He only had about 1% of the vote.
[02:33:05.178 --> 02:33:10.528]  Well, Barry Goldwater Jr., a congressman from California in his own right, is...
[02:33:12.114 --> 02:33:18.178]  Out there campaigning in New Hampshire right now while Ron ran out to California to be on Jay Leno and do media this evening.
[02:33:18.218 --> 02:33:19.819]  Of course, on CNN and other places.
[02:33:20.400 --> 02:33:26.184]  And we're very, very honored to have Barry Goldwater Jr., who looks like a clone of his father, on the show with us.
[02:33:26.204 --> 02:33:27.805]  Mr. Goldwater, thanks for taking time out.
[02:33:28.205 --> 02:33:29.126]  My pleasure, Alex.
[02:33:29.166 --> 02:33:31.928]  Nice being here to campaign for my friend and buddy Ron Paul.
[02:33:32.717 --> 02:33:33.317]  Absolutely.
[02:33:33.377 --> 02:33:41.681]  I heard you this morning driving into work with that neocon in libertarian clothing, Neil Bortz, and I heard him talk about how he was driving your dad to the airport one time and almost killed him.
[02:33:43.922 --> 02:33:53.327]  Well, I'll tell you, politics is wonderful, it's great, and New Hampshire is a great state, and the people are thoughtful, but I'll tell you, they're unpredictable.
[02:33:53.707 --> 02:33:55.368]  But I think Ron's going to do pretty good.
[02:33:56.008 --> 02:33:59.590]  He may not win it, but he's getting his message out, which is important.
[02:34:00.771 --> 02:34:01.632]  Well, absolutely.
[02:34:01.652 --> 02:34:12.100]  I mean, who could have thought two years ago that Jay Leno would be having Ron Paul on and that the youth would be learning about the Constitution and Bill of Rights again and that suddenly it would be the cool thing to do?
[02:34:12.460 --> 02:34:18.145]  Well, you know, people don't remember this, but back in 1964, my father was just a blip on the radar screen.
[02:34:18.525 --> 02:34:21.247]  Nobody really paid much attention to conservatism.
[02:34:21.668 --> 02:34:25.531]  But my father, and he didn't win here in New Hampshire, Cavett Lodge,
[02:34:26.044 --> 02:34:26.605]  We're good to go.
[02:34:26.625 --> 02:34:27.085]  We're good to go.
[02:34:51.187 --> 02:34:53.568]  Why do you think Fox banned him from the debate?
[02:34:53.588 --> 02:34:55.409]  I mean, didn't they know that was going to blow up in their face?
[02:34:55.870 --> 02:34:59.391]  Well, I appeared on Fox this morning, and I chewed them out for doing that.
[02:34:59.431 --> 02:35:00.572]  I said, shame on you.
[02:35:00.992 --> 02:35:05.755]  You are not, what do they call it, even fair and balanced.
[02:35:05.835 --> 02:35:07.316]  I said, you are unfair and balanced.
[02:35:07.636 --> 02:35:12.438]  And they explained to me that the polls didn't show them very high.
[02:35:13.039 --> 02:35:15.260]  And I said, my God, he came in third in Iowa.
[02:35:15.500 --> 02:35:16.621]  He's raised $20 million.
[02:35:17.634 --> 02:35:19.675]  He has a groundswell, his building.
[02:35:19.995 --> 02:35:25.478]  You know, get out of your building and take a look, and shame on you.
[02:35:26.439 --> 02:35:30.361]  The only reason they gave me was that he didn't show up big in the polls.
[02:35:30.801 --> 02:35:39.186]  Have you heard about the new video showing Frank Luntz staging focus groups with selected people to make it look like Mitt Romney and others are going to be the winners?
[02:35:40.066 --> 02:35:41.207]  No, I didn't hear about that.
[02:35:41.867 --> 02:35:42.587]  Not surprised.
[02:35:42.868 --> 02:35:45.449]  A lot of strange things happen in campaigns.
[02:35:46.272 --> 02:35:47.132]  I bet they do.
[02:35:47.552 --> 02:35:58.975]  We're talking to Barry Goldwater Jr., who, of course, no stranger to politics himself, not just a famous father who got the Republican nomination back in 64 from nowhere, but also is an icon with anti-New World Order crowd.
[02:35:59.615 --> 02:36:05.196]  Expanding on that, from your experience in Congress and races, what do you see happening with this Paul campaign?
[02:36:05.216 --> 02:36:09.037]  Because, as you said this morning, it's gaining momentum exponentially.
[02:36:09.917 --> 02:36:15.778]  Well, you know, it's hard to say where it's going to go, but hopefully the people around the country will listen.
[02:36:16.405 --> 02:36:32.884]  And they will agree and they will demand of their elected legislators that they too start working for a smaller, more meaningful government, a stronger national defense, and bring some of our troops home and quit being nation-buildings.
[02:36:34.216 --> 02:36:38.177]  Barry Goldwater, Jr., a quote from your father from memory.
[02:36:38.197 --> 02:36:39.558]  Tell me if I paraphrase it wrong.
[02:36:39.718 --> 02:36:47.820]  I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice, and let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.
[02:36:48.140 --> 02:36:54.042]  And he also said that sometimes silence isn't golden, it's yellow.
[02:36:55.063 --> 02:36:56.183]  Are those accurate quotes?
[02:36:56.483 --> 02:36:57.643]  Yeah, they sure are.
[02:36:58.084 --> 02:36:59.224]  He said a lot of things.
[02:36:59.969 --> 02:37:01.870]  He also told me to keep it out of town.
[02:37:05.311 --> 02:37:07.592]  So, yeah, he did say those things.
[02:37:07.712 --> 02:37:12.955]  And, you know, he was a great protector of our freedoms and of our liberties.
[02:37:13.095 --> 02:37:16.416]  And he was known for that.
[02:37:17.277 --> 02:37:19.538]  And he got a lot of support over the years.
[02:37:19.598 --> 02:37:22.839]  And Ronald Reagan picked up the mantle and did very well.
[02:37:22.999 --> 02:37:24.740]  And now we have Ron Paul.
[02:37:26.007 --> 02:37:27.328]  Well, we certainly do.
[02:37:27.348 --> 02:37:37.956]  I think that Ron Paul now is going to be, regardless, in the record books, in history, as big an icon as your father, regardless of where this nomination goes.
[02:37:37.976 --> 02:37:38.837]  Do you agree with that statement?
[02:37:39.377 --> 02:37:41.139]  Well, I think he has all the potential.
[02:37:41.219 --> 02:37:45.102]  Ron's a likable guy, and his message is very clear.
[02:37:45.122 --> 02:37:47.784]  He's very easy to understand.
[02:37:47.804 --> 02:37:50.346]  There's nothing complicated about it.
[02:37:51.347 --> 02:37:54.269]  And what a contrast to the other Republican candidates
[02:37:54.696 --> 02:37:57.197]  Well, expanding on that, Barry Goldwater Jr.,
[02:38:08.681 --> 02:38:10.082]  The Republicans aren't stupid.
[02:38:10.102 --> 02:38:11.963]  I've seen all the polls, the numbers for a year.
[02:38:12.724 --> 02:38:15.246]  Double the money going to the Democrats that's been going to Republicans.
[02:38:15.286 --> 02:38:18.748]  Now that's starting to change here as the race gets closer.
[02:38:19.188 --> 02:38:22.530]  But the defense contractors are giving more money to the Democrats than Republicans.
[02:38:22.811 --> 02:38:25.753]  We see the Republicans basically just putting their B team forward.
[02:38:26.793 --> 02:38:30.616]  And they know they've got to come out anti-war to win this election, but they just won't do it.
[02:38:30.916 --> 02:38:35.999]  So they had to block Ron out of the debate because he embarrasses the fact that they're phony conservatives.
[02:38:36.019 --> 02:38:36.640]  Can you speak to that?
[02:38:37.245 --> 02:38:39.106]  Well, you know, you're right.
[02:38:40.307 --> 02:38:43.149]  The Republicans have gotten off message.
[02:38:43.889 --> 02:38:49.253]  They've gotten away from their basic, the things that made them successful.
[02:38:49.913 --> 02:38:53.516]  And they've ventured into areas that are un-Republican.
[02:38:53.956 --> 02:39:03.943]  For instance, under conservatives, there's been the single greatest expansion of government since LBJ.
[02:39:04.761 --> 02:39:08.665]  Now, this is under Republican administration, Republican control.
[02:39:09.126 --> 02:39:12.269]  That's not what conservatives or libertarians are about.
[02:39:12.849 --> 02:39:17.834]  And so we've gotten away from what the Republicans stand for, and we're getting spanked for it.
[02:39:18.976 --> 02:39:27.784]  And we need somebody who's got a stronger voice than just moderation and just stay on the same old thing.
[02:39:27.825 --> 02:39:28.165]  We need...
[02:39:28.587 --> 02:39:34.749]  Some strong language that will remind us about the Constitution and what the Constitution says about our freedoms.
[02:39:35.089 --> 02:39:36.809]  Mr. Goldwater, you've got the name.
[02:39:36.829 --> 02:39:41.370]  You've also distinguishedly served your country and you have military training.
[02:39:42.310 --> 02:39:50.432]  On top of that, you are good friends with Congressman Ron Paul going way back to before his first congressional run.
[02:39:50.672 --> 02:39:55.794]  There's a lot of talk about you with your experience being Ron Paul's VP pick.
[02:39:55.814 --> 02:39:56.794]  Have you heard anything about that?
[02:39:57.114 --> 02:40:01.297]  No, that's the first time I've heard of that, Alex, and I don't want you to start these rumors.
[02:40:02.137 --> 02:40:02.517]  Oh, yeah.
[02:40:02.838 --> 02:40:04.359]  You know, I've served my time.
[02:40:04.999 --> 02:40:05.980]  I'm back in business.
[02:40:06.540 --> 02:40:13.324]  I like coming out and helping as a volunteer, and that's the way it's going to be right now.
[02:40:13.484 --> 02:40:19.088]  There's a lot of good people in the Republican Party and throughout the country that Ron needs.
[02:40:19.408 --> 02:40:22.730]  It's a young man's game, and it needs new blood like Ron's.
[02:40:24.210 --> 02:40:27.213]  Okay, but I'm sure it's been in a few national papers.
[02:40:27.233 --> 02:40:28.854]  You're saying it's the first you've heard of it?
[02:40:29.115 --> 02:40:30.296]  Yeah, that's the first I've heard of it.
[02:40:30.416 --> 02:40:32.257]  Well, let me just give you the newsflash.
[02:40:32.277 --> 02:40:35.961]  Since last Friday, it's been floated about that you may be his VP.
[02:40:37.722 --> 02:40:38.863]  Well, wouldn't that be fun?
[02:40:39.824 --> 02:40:42.527]  So you're saying right now that's the first you've heard of it?
[02:40:42.547 --> 02:40:43.868]  That's the first I've heard of it.
[02:40:44.008 --> 02:40:44.749]  Scout's Honor.
[02:40:45.049 --> 02:40:45.950]  That's honest.
[02:40:46.290 --> 02:40:47.451]  That's the first I've heard of it.
[02:40:47.471 --> 02:40:48.452]  I've never even thought about it.
[02:40:48.932 --> 02:40:50.193]  Well, I believe you then.
[02:40:50.253 --> 02:40:51.033]  We'll see what happens.
[02:40:51.273 --> 02:40:52.574]  What about third-party runs?
[02:40:52.834 --> 02:41:09.383]  Ron did say on the show the last couple times you've been on with us, and so has his son, that obviously before he wasn't thinking about a third-party run, but if he doesn't get it, he's going to have this war chest and really a responsibility to continue to carry the ball into the national final debates to educate people on real issues.
[02:41:09.403 --> 02:41:10.463]  Do you have any take on that?
[02:41:10.643 --> 02:41:11.424]  Well, I don't.
[02:41:11.764 --> 02:41:13.465]  That's the first I've heard of that.
[02:41:14.785 --> 02:41:15.966]  Generally, third-parties...
[02:41:17.250 --> 02:41:26.794]  Are not very productive, but from a strategic point of view, they very well could play a role in the final decision.
[02:41:27.534 --> 02:41:29.675]  But that's something Iran's got to decide.
[02:41:31.556 --> 02:41:41.820]  Historically, we're a two-party country, and you need to be part of a party, and its infrastructure and communications and finance capabilities
[02:41:42.752 --> 02:41:44.413]  That's right.
[02:41:44.434 --> 02:41:46.755]  The machinery's there for Republicans and Democrats.
[02:41:46.835 --> 02:41:47.215]  Absolutely.
[02:41:47.235 --> 02:41:48.977]  I'm just trying to look out past the first round of...
[02:42:04.096 --> 02:42:05.756]  But that's too early to decide that.
[02:42:06.317 --> 02:42:07.577]  And why would it be strategic?
[02:42:07.597 --> 02:42:14.098]  Because then you could throw support in the final hour behind the party that was, say, anti-war, anti-Federal Reserve, something like that?
[02:42:14.639 --> 02:42:17.659]  Well, as a third party, you would have some muscle.
[02:42:18.279 --> 02:42:24.681]  You would have a lever that you could use to negotiate other activities within the party.
[02:42:25.783 --> 02:42:28.605]  Mr. Goldwater, what do you think about what's happening to the dollar right now?
[02:42:28.685 --> 02:42:35.088]  Gold at $8.65, oil above $100 a barrel, and the dollar going down, down, down.
[02:42:35.128 --> 02:42:37.690]  I mean, Ron Paul, you've been talking about this for 30 years.
[02:42:37.710 --> 02:42:38.610]  Your dad's been talking about it for 50.
[02:42:39.010 --> 02:42:41.452]  Ron Paul's been talking about it for 30 years.
[02:42:41.732 --> 02:42:47.195]  And now it's almost like on time for his campaign, the dollar is going in the toilet.
[02:42:48.010 --> 02:42:52.434]  Well, it is because our government has continued to spend beyond its means.
[02:42:52.494 --> 02:42:54.916]  We've not had a balanced budget.
[02:42:55.316 --> 02:43:05.164]  We've got to go out and finance that balanced budget by selling debt, and that devalues our dollar, and it's inflation that's causing this.
[02:43:06.465 --> 02:43:11.029]  I wish I'd have bought gold way back when, but you're absolutely right.
[02:43:11.710 --> 02:43:15.813]  The value of our currency, the value of our commerce, and our reputation as a
[02:43:16.238 --> 02:43:21.261]  As an economic powerhouse is being jeopardized by current government policies.
[02:43:21.381 --> 02:43:29.806]  And he's the only candidate that has a plan to deal with that, and a sound plan, and was talking about the plan before the crises even deepened.
[02:43:30.446 --> 02:43:33.768]  Well, Ron does, and first he believes in a balanced budget.
[02:43:34.108 --> 02:43:40.872]  He'd like to get some kind of support for the dollar, such as gold, so that it's predictable.
[02:43:41.525 --> 02:43:47.573]  And, of course, our foreign policies need to be changed around.
[02:43:48.093 --> 02:43:54.141]  But, yeah, we're in a precarious situation internationally in terms of our currency.
[02:43:55.103 --> 02:43:58.625]  We've only got a few minutes left with you because the break's coming up, and I appreciate your time.
[02:43:58.665 --> 02:44:04.909]  But shifting gears into the whole New World Order, the Congressman talks about those that want a global government, those that want internationalism.
[02:44:05.209 --> 02:44:09.251]  Your father was one of the first big national figures to fight that.
[02:44:10.352 --> 02:44:11.693]  How do you think the New World Order's doing?
[02:44:11.733 --> 02:44:14.474]  They plan to basically have their global governance, global tax by 2000.
[02:44:14.534 --> 02:44:16.896]  They admit they're behind schedule.
[02:44:16.916 --> 02:44:19.157]  People are now starting to wake up to their North American Union.
[02:44:19.437 --> 02:44:24.380]  Can you speak to where you think the New World Order is and where they're going in the future versus the people?
[02:44:25.416 --> 02:44:27.978]  Boy, I don't know anything about the New World Order.
[02:44:29.859 --> 02:44:31.201]  I mean, I've never heard of that term.
[02:44:31.241 --> 02:44:32.181]  Tell me more.
[02:44:32.381 --> 02:44:34.183]  You're being sarcastic, Mr. Goldwater.
[02:44:34.343 --> 02:44:36.304]  Well, I don't use the term New World Order.
[02:44:36.725 --> 02:44:38.966]  The one that George Bush Sr.
[02:44:39.067 --> 02:44:39.567]  talked about.
[02:44:40.530 --> 02:44:48.658]  The one that Ron Paul talks about when he talks about global governance, the move towards internationalism, the carbon tax, the law of the sea treaty.
[02:44:49.058 --> 02:44:50.039]  Okay, okay.
[02:44:50.940 --> 02:44:53.642]  I never used that term, but I understand what you're talking about.
[02:44:53.662 --> 02:44:54.223]  The globalist.
[02:44:54.483 --> 02:44:56.625]  Yeah, I understand what you're talking about now.
[02:44:56.745 --> 02:45:06.754]  And obviously, Ron, as opposed to all that, you know, we need to take care of America and be careful about joining all these alliances that,
[02:45:07.150 --> 02:45:14.373]  That jeopardize our freedoms and the banking alliances that have too much influence.
[02:45:14.754 --> 02:45:16.274]  The United Nations is another.
[02:45:16.294 --> 02:45:22.037]  I think Ron is correct on this and is a lot more well-versed than I am.
[02:45:23.197 --> 02:45:28.840]  But it is something that we're slowly moving ourselves into.
[02:45:28.900 --> 02:45:31.021]  We've got to be careful about it.
[02:45:31.909 --> 02:45:35.431]  In closing, what do you think is going to happen if Ron Paul doesn't win, God forbid?
[02:45:35.771 --> 02:45:49.277]  The Democrats get in or some doe-eyed fake conservative who's always clutching his little commercial items like Huckabee gets in and then everything starts unraveling and the Congress has an 11% approval rating.
[02:45:49.998 --> 02:45:53.540]  I mean, with some little rat at the helm, it's going to be that much worse for this nation.
[02:45:54.120 --> 02:45:56.181]  I mean, I see nothing but dark times ahead, period.
[02:45:56.621 --> 02:45:58.762]  Well, let's hope not.
[02:45:58.842 --> 02:46:00.523]  And I think what happens is that
[02:46:01.218 --> 02:46:01.638]  We're good to go.
[02:46:31.011 --> 02:46:34.294]  And I still think that there's hope in this country.
[02:46:34.795 --> 02:46:35.816]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:46:35.976 --> 02:46:38.498]  More and more hope at the end of the tunnel as we get closer to it.
[02:46:39.139 --> 02:46:40.841]  You know, George Sr.
[02:46:40.981 --> 02:46:42.743]  called himself a Rockefeller Republican.
[02:46:42.783 --> 02:46:45.806]  I think we're now going to have the term a Ron Paul Republican.
[02:46:46.506 --> 02:46:47.407]  Well, that could be.
[02:46:47.467 --> 02:46:54.394]  There was a Goldwater Republican, and I think Ron Paul comes closest to being a Goldwater conservative, Goldwater Republican.
[02:46:55.225 --> 02:46:58.207]  What do you think is going to happen tomorrow in closing?
[02:46:58.327 --> 02:47:00.329]  Do you think second or third place or could win?
[02:47:00.649 --> 02:47:02.810]  Well, I think he could very easily take third.
[02:47:03.791 --> 02:47:13.858]  I don't know that's pushing it to go second, but I think he has a good chance of finishing up a strong third, and we'll just have to wait and see.
[02:47:14.058 --> 02:47:15.139]  RonPaul2008.com.
[02:47:15.179 --> 02:47:21.183]  Mr. Goldwater, I know you're out there campaigning for Ron Paul, but any of your writings or work you've done, any websites you want to plug?
[02:47:22.040 --> 02:47:25.162]  No, I'm just here punching for Ron Paul.
[02:47:25.923 --> 02:47:27.444]  Well, God bless you, Mr. Goldwater.
[02:47:27.464 --> 02:47:32.448]  It was a real honor to interview you, and I really appreciate your fine work and all the fine work of your father.
[02:47:32.488 --> 02:47:35.130]  And again, thanks for being out there for Ron Paul in New Hampshire.
[02:47:35.150 --> 02:47:35.650]  God bless you.
[02:47:35.850 --> 02:47:36.911]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[02:47:37.091 --> 02:47:37.432]  Bye-bye.
[02:47:37.552 --> 02:47:37.992]  Take care.
[02:47:38.592 --> 02:47:39.393]  All right, there he goes.
[02:47:40.874 --> 02:47:45.918]  Being a little bit guarded with the New World Order concept, being the politician there, but he's a nice guy.
[02:47:46.098 --> 02:47:48.480]  I know that Bortz was attacking him on that this morning.
[02:47:49.386 --> 02:47:51.950]  And so he's in political mode.
[02:47:52.370 --> 02:47:54.553]  Yeah, Barry Goldwater's his dad.
[02:47:54.874 --> 02:47:56.817]  He doesn't know what the New World Order is.
[02:47:58.178 --> 02:48:02.144]  This is not the 1960s where the blue-haired ladies freak out if you talk about it.
[02:48:03.141 --> 02:48:09.768]  This is 2008, ladies and gentlemen, and we're going to talk about it, and we're going to discuss it, and it's kosher to talk about it all.
[02:48:09.808 --> 02:48:10.929]  We appreciate him coming on.
[02:48:11.389 --> 02:48:14.372]  We appreciate him lending the Goldwater name to all this.
[02:48:14.392 --> 02:48:21.379]  That's meant to get the old folks out who remember Barry Goldwater and loathe Lyndon Baines Johnson.
[02:48:22.120 --> 02:48:22.480]  Yeah, and it's 64.
[02:48:22.580 --> 02:48:24.442]  I don't know why I was saying 68 earlier.
[02:48:24.922 --> 02:48:26.624]  It all runs together, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:27.093 --> 02:48:28.674]  Did he run again in 68 or something?
[02:48:29.154 --> 02:48:29.815]  It doesn't matter.
[02:48:30.075 --> 02:48:33.357]  The point is, RonPaulWarRoom.com is up and running.
[02:48:33.417 --> 02:48:34.958]  RonPaulWarRoom.com.
[02:48:35.518 --> 02:48:37.300]  Closing comments on the police state.
[02:48:37.340 --> 02:48:38.460]  Maybe a few final calls.
[02:48:38.881 --> 02:48:40.502]  Final segment straight ahead.
[02:48:40.522 --> 02:48:44.844]  Stay with us.
[02:48:46.285 --> 02:48:47.686]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:48.767 --> 02:48:49.788]  A new world order.
[02:48:50.548 --> 02:48:54.911]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:48:55.399 --> 02:48:57.160]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[02:48:57.380 --> 02:49:00.482]  Wouldn't their objective be world domination?
[02:49:01.022 --> 02:49:03.464]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:49:04.204 --> 02:49:11.529]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:14.537 --> 02:49:19.521]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:20.001 --> 02:49:23.463]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:23.864 --> 02:49:26.365]  Bill Vargas makes great progress toward a world government.
[02:49:26.425 --> 02:49:27.406]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:27.426 --> 02:49:28.367]  They're not after money.
[02:49:28.387 --> 02:49:29.447]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:29.648 --> 02:49:30.428]  They're after power.
[02:49:30.648 --> 02:49:31.669]  That's what they have to do.
[02:49:31.789 --> 02:49:39.975]  Order Endgame on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:49:40.175 --> 02:49:40.915]  Endgame.
[02:49:41.256 --> 02:49:42.877]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:49:43.277 --> 02:49:44.498]  You have been warned.
[02:49:45.479 --> 02:49:48.421]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:49:48.581 --> 02:49:53.726]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:49:54.106 --> 02:49:59.390]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:49:59.831 --> 02:50:00.951]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:50:01.312 --> 02:50:10.179]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[02:50:10.619 --> 02:50:12.221]  Now compare a Cal Bend Pure Soap.

[02:51:50.211 --> 02:51:51.311]  All right, final segment.
[02:51:51.711 --> 02:51:52.751]  I just got some breaking news.
[02:51:52.772 --> 02:51:54.032]  We can't take those final calls.
[02:51:54.112 --> 02:51:54.952]  I apologize.
[02:51:55.012 --> 02:51:58.393]  Live tomorrow, again, 11 to 2 Central, noon to 3 Eastern.
[02:51:58.873 --> 02:52:00.013]  More big guests tomorrow.
[02:52:00.073 --> 02:52:04.314]  By the way, in the first hour, we have Mike Rivera on about election fraud and the evidence of it.
[02:52:04.334 --> 02:52:07.734]  That show restarts in five minutes on the Internet at InfoWars.com.
[02:52:07.874 --> 02:52:09.795]  If you missed any of the first hour, you can go to the stream.
[02:52:10.195 --> 02:52:11.955]  The main stream right there is what it's called.
[02:52:12.615 --> 02:52:15.396]  Just main InfoWars stream, and you can listen at the end of the show.
[02:52:15.416 --> 02:52:16.496]  I want to thank all of our affiliates.
[02:52:17.430 --> 02:52:21.271]  He just told me about something his mother told me, our producer, that we saw in the CNN debate.
[02:52:21.551 --> 02:52:24.932]  They were showing the Democrats, so that's coming up in just a moment.
[02:52:25.012 --> 02:52:27.632]  First, I want to tell you about eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:52:28.432 --> 02:52:33.793]  They are the nation's oldest and largest storable foods company.
[02:52:33.853 --> 02:52:40.875]  It's the highest quality freeze-dried, very good for storing, last 10 years, and it's compact, so it doesn't take up a lot of room.
[02:52:41.795 --> 02:52:44.896]  With all the craziness happening, you need this 10-year food supply.
[02:52:45.116 --> 02:52:46.316]  It's insurance you can eat.
[02:52:47.074 --> 02:52:53.858]  And five, six years later, you eat it, it tastes just as good as the day it was freeze-dried, and it'll be a lot cheaper then than it is now, you know, with inflation.
[02:52:54.098 --> 02:52:55.499]  Give them a call, 1-800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com.
[02:53:02.422 --> 02:53:02.783]  We're good to go.
[02:53:20.101 --> 02:53:20.902]  We're good to go.
[02:53:41.561 --> 02:53:43.782]  It's just so power-packed, 20 ingredients.

[02:53:56.925 --> 02:53:59.366]  Visit that banner on PrisonPlanet.com.

[02:54:14.714 --> 02:54:18.438]  Finishing up here, Trey, tell us what your mom called you this morning from Houston.
[02:54:18.698 --> 02:54:20.580]  Said she watched the Democratic debate and what happened.
[02:54:21.220 --> 02:54:23.503]  She said she got a big kick out of it.
[02:54:23.583 --> 02:54:30.469]  They were outside, I think it was the Barbara Walters one, where they were outside and she was talking, she's a big Hillary supporter, talking to all the Hillary people.
[02:54:30.489 --> 02:54:32.591]  There's like 20 Hillary supporters with their signs and
[02:54:33.148 --> 02:54:45.716]  The camera's panning down the line, and then all of a sudden you get a big 9-11 was an inside job sign, and then she said the camera just shuffles back to the other direction real fast, and there's a bunch of Ron Paul signs.
[02:54:45.736 --> 02:54:46.476]  That's what's happening.
[02:54:46.496 --> 02:54:51.659]  They're running back and forth, back and forth, and then they finally just had to focus with 20 Hillary supporters.
[02:54:51.719 --> 02:54:59.484]  Well, see, what happens when all the people do what we are changing, InfoWarriors have done, what happens when, and see, that's contagious.
[02:54:59.544 --> 02:55:01.085]  It isn't just about getting your name in the news.
[02:55:01.698 --> 02:55:07.703]  You know, this story attacking We Are Change from Radar Magazine says, oh, yeah, they get all this national attention, but nobody plugs their name.
[02:55:08.044 --> 02:55:08.544]  So what?
[02:55:08.604 --> 02:55:09.865]  It's about fighting the New World Order.
[02:55:10.125 --> 02:55:11.727]  It's about getting others to go out and fight.
[02:55:11.767 --> 02:55:12.607]  It's about history.
[02:55:12.748 --> 02:55:13.668]  It's about fighting evil.
[02:55:13.688 --> 02:55:16.150]  It isn't about getting our stupid names in the paper.
[02:55:16.171 --> 02:55:17.672]  In fact, that's actually a liability.
[02:55:18.012 --> 02:55:18.633]  Go out there.
[02:55:18.713 --> 02:55:19.954]  Do what We Are Change is doing.
[02:55:19.974 --> 02:55:21.415]  Do what the Ron Paul people are doing.
[02:55:21.835 --> 02:55:27.760]  Every event, everywhere the establishment goes, they want to have their facade, their fake focus groups, showing everybody their illusion.
[02:55:28.081 --> 02:55:29.462]  Their illusion is crumbling, Trey.
[02:55:29.982 --> 02:55:37.909]  I saw Mr. Goldwater on Fox when he was giving it to Fox today, and I just want to say that was the best comeback I'd ever heard.
[02:55:38.409 --> 02:55:42.272]  So I agree, you know, they're doing anything they can to keep Ron out of it, and we're not going to let them.
[02:55:42.433 --> 02:55:43.053]  Good job.
[02:55:43.073 --> 02:55:44.454]  We've got big guests coming up this week.
[02:55:44.474 --> 02:55:44.975]  Thank you, Trey.
[02:55:45.435 --> 02:55:45.675]  All right.
[02:55:45.775 --> 02:55:46.516]  Sorry to the callers.
[02:55:46.556 --> 02:55:47.216]  Show is over.
[02:55:47.236 --> 02:55:48.757]  Unless you want to tune back in to the first hour.
[02:55:48.797 --> 02:55:49.857]  We got into election fraud.
[02:55:50.238 --> 02:55:51.018]  It is going on.
[02:55:51.058 --> 02:55:53.379]  If you don't think it's a factor, you've got another thing coming.
[02:55:53.659 --> 02:55:54.980]  New Hampshire's a big day tomorrow.
[02:55:55.020 --> 02:55:57.521]  Don't forget all the latest news, all the latest tracking.
[02:55:57.782 --> 02:55:59.502]  You can be part of that, being up to date.
