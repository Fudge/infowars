[00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:01.770]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:02.431 --> 00:00:03.231]  You want answers?
[00:00:04.012 --> 00:00:04.912]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:05.573 --> 00:00:09.215]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:09.756 --> 00:00:13.859]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.462]  Alright folks, it is the 4th of July, Independence Day.
[00:00:18.542 --> 00:00:20.804]  I'm not Alex Jones, I am Jason Burma sitting in.
[00:00:20.844 --> 00:00:25.007]  I'd like to thank Alex for giving me the opportunity to do this 4th of July show.
[00:00:25.707 --> 00:00:26.848]  Very exciting stuff.
[00:00:26.908 --> 00:00:29.530]  I never thought I'd be sitting in the hot seat, if you will.
[00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:39.550]  On such a very special day, and not only is it special because it does represent our breaking away from tyranny, our becoming independent.
[00:00:40.325 --> 00:00:43.046]  But also because we launched a new movie yesterday.
[00:00:44.047 --> 00:00:44.987]  We launched a little early.
[00:00:45.407 --> 00:00:47.268]  Unfortunately, we had two server issues.
[00:00:47.428 --> 00:00:51.310]  Two of the DivX files got cut off, but we re-uploaded the files.
[00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.650]  It wasn't an encoding issue.
[00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.572]  Something weird happened with the server where it cut off half a megabyte or something.
[00:00:56.892 --> 00:00:58.173]  But it looks great.
[00:00:58.213 --> 00:01:04.355]  The people that have downloaded and watched it on their DivX DVD players, television sets, and computers are raving about it.
[00:01:04.375 --> 00:01:06.196]  There's a bunch of comments out there.
[00:01:06.216 --> 00:01:08.557]  It's already up on the Torrent file sharing networks.
[00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:18.667]  Which is very encouraging to us, and we're really hoping that you're going to go over to PrisonPlan.TV, get the high-quality version, burn them to disk, and spread them around.
[00:01:18.687 --> 00:01:30.352]  We're going to have Luke Radowski on for a full hour in the fourth hour, the fourth and final hour of this broadcast, to talk about Truth Rising and what's coming up for September 11th this year.
[00:01:30.633 --> 00:01:32.593]  There are some things in the works, of course, folks.
[00:01:32.613 --> 00:01:33.574]  We weren't going to leave you hanging.
[00:01:33.814 --> 00:01:36.795]  We're going to be at New York City yet again this year.
[00:01:36.855 --> 00:01:37.916]  We are changed, and
[00:01:39.218 --> 00:01:43.579]  Corey Rowe really working hard right now to bring you a top-notch event down there.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.280]  It's really exciting.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:55.063]  And we're going to talk about more of that later, but we are going to have Philly 9-11 Truth, who are also doing street actions in literally, you know, Independence Hall.
[00:01:55.103 --> 00:01:55.923]  I mean, this is the place.
[00:01:55.943 --> 00:01:57.044]  This is where the Liberty Bell is.
[00:01:57.764 --> 00:01:59.564]  This is where a lot of our history happened.
[00:01:59.584 --> 00:02:03.345]  If you've never been to Philadelphia, it's one of the cooler cities out there, folks.
[00:02:03.846 --> 00:02:04.846]  I've been there a couple times.
[00:02:04.906 --> 00:02:08.307]  I actually lived outside of Philadelphia and New Jersey for a couple months.
[00:02:08.737 --> 00:02:11.037]  Back in 2001, I believe.
[00:02:11.077 --> 00:02:13.138]  I think it was, like, actually right after the attack.
[00:02:13.158 --> 00:02:14.638]  Maybe a month after I'd moved out there.
[00:02:15.238 --> 00:02:16.378]  And, uh, it's just a great city.
[00:02:16.418 --> 00:02:17.039]  Full of history.
[00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:19.419]  Very cool town.
[00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:21.219]  Lots of Masonic stuff, too, to check out.
[00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:24.440]  If you're into all the symbolism, it's everywhere in there.
[00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.880]  Especially inside the museums.
[00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.581]  So we're gonna have Philadelphia 9-11 Truth on for a half an hour at half past this hour.
[00:02:31.621 --> 00:02:36.362]  And then we're also going to have Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster.
[00:02:38.008 --> 00:02:41.932]  And he's going to talk with us for about 90 minutes about what's going on with the economy.
[00:02:41.972 --> 00:02:42.773]  Tons of news!
[00:02:42.793 --> 00:02:47.417]  I think Counterpunch just did a new article on Dennis Kucinich.
[00:02:48.038 --> 00:03:01.911]  And the fact that prior to Dennis putting out those 35 articles of impeachment, Nancy Pelosi and AIPAC came into his office and offered him some kind of a... And by the way folks, AIPAC is the big Israeli lobby if you don't know.
[00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:09.032]  And I offered him some sort of, uh, Oh, Dennis, please just don't impeach.
[00:03:09.112 --> 00:03:11.954]  Don't put these articles out there and there'll be something in it for you.
[00:03:11.974 --> 00:03:14.315]  So we're going to go over that article as well.
[00:03:14.576 --> 00:03:15.336]  Dennis Kucinich.
[00:03:16.177 --> 00:03:17.898]  I think he's one of the heroes of the year.
[00:03:18.418 --> 00:03:23.201]  Um, obviously Ron Paul is up there, but Dennis Kucinich didn't let it flicker out.
[00:03:23.241 --> 00:03:24.241]  Didn't let it fade out.
[00:03:24.342 --> 00:03:25.482]  Went for the throat.
[00:03:26.003 --> 00:03:27.443]  Okay.
[00:03:27.463 --> 00:03:28.664]  35 articles of impeachment.
[00:03:28.724 --> 00:03:30.645]  I don't think it's been talked about enough.
[00:03:32.146 --> 00:03:33.307]  I don't think it's been talked about.
[00:03:33.726 --> 00:03:34.086]  Enough!
[00:03:35.366 --> 00:03:40.028]  Okay, and by the way, folks, I want to take your calls in this first half hour, especially if you've seen Truth Rising.
[00:03:40.568 --> 00:03:42.248]  We'll try to bump you to the front of the line.
[00:03:42.268 --> 00:03:43.488]  I want to get your opinions on it.
[00:03:43.848 --> 00:03:47.589]  I know we've had thousands of downloads over at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:50.870]  I know it's been uploaded, I think, somewhere to YouTube already.
[00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.511]  It's going to be on Google Video shortly, if it's not already there.
[00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:54.631]  Like I said, the torrents are wild.
[00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:57.672]  So if you've seen the movie, please call in and let us know what you think.
[00:03:59.052 --> 00:04:00.812]  Anyway, Kucinich.
[00:04:01.052 --> 00:04:01.873]  35 articles of impeachment.
[00:04:02.093 --> 00:04:03.173]  Not an easy task.
[00:04:03.826 --> 00:04:06.747]  Three plus hours before the house, and this wasn't prime house time.
[00:04:06.787 --> 00:04:11.467]  I mean, I think he went on around 9 o'clock Eastern.
[00:04:11.928 --> 00:04:13.448]  Maybe a little bit before 9 Eastern.
[00:04:13.648 --> 00:04:14.308]  That's pretty late.
[00:04:14.728 --> 00:04:17.469]  And he stood for over three hours.
[00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:19.049]  He covered it all.
[00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:21.109]  He covered the domestic wiretapping.
[00:04:21.869 --> 00:04:22.170]  Okay?
[00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.590]  He covered the torture.
[00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.210]  He covered the outright tearing.
[00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.351]  He even covered 9-11 in the last three.
[00:04:28.391 --> 00:04:29.891]  What else could we ask for, folks?
[00:04:30.811 --> 00:04:31.913]  It's the Alex Jones Show!
[00:04:31.953 --> 00:04:36.219]  PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com, 9-11 Truth Rising is out!
[00:04:53.527 --> 00:04:56.070]  Hemp, the superfood for you and your family.
[00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.734]  Hemp has nutritional values that far exceed any known plant.
[00:05:00.234 --> 00:05:03.658]  Hemp, used for food, clothing, and shelter since time began.
[00:05:04.018 --> 00:05:11.086]  Hemp, this God-given food source is controlled by your government, making it not legal to grow for American people and farmers, but legal to import.
[00:05:11.426 --> 00:05:14.690]  Our Founding Fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.
[00:05:14.971 --> 00:05:18.815]  The protein powder, seeds, and oil are available through hempusa.org.
[00:05:19.156 --> 00:05:30.249]  Recommended daily intake of this food source will allow the body to heal itself from many ailments loaded with potassium, magnesium, calcium, essential fatty acids, amino acids, and nutrients not available in other plants.
[00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:34.872]  Hemp can be stored with a long shelf life as a life-sustaining food source for you and your family.
[00:05:35.072 --> 00:05:36.953]  Could this be the government's best-kept secret?
[00:05:37.193 --> 00:05:43.437]  Call today at 908-691-2608 and see what the powder, seeds, and oil can do for you.
[00:05:43.797 --> 00:05:47.119]  Learn, help, shop at hempusa.org.
[00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:48.360]  We do not charge for shipping.
[00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:53.002]  That's 908-691-2608 or go to hempusa.org today.
[00:05:53.983 --> 00:05:55.404]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:55.424 --> 00:05:57.525]  A new world order.
[00:05:58.245 --> 00:05:58.986]  In the near future.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.601]  Earth is dominated by a powerful new world government.
[00:06:03.102 --> 00:06:05.903]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:06:05.923 --> 00:06:08.185]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:06:08.725 --> 00:06:11.186]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:06:11.907 --> 00:06:19.231]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:06:22.267 --> 00:06:27.230]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:06:27.691 --> 00:06:31.173]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:06:31.573 --> 00:06:34.055]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:06:34.135 --> 00:06:35.276]  Most people have no idea.
[00:06:35.296 --> 00:06:36.056]  They're not after money.
[00:06:36.076 --> 00:06:37.157]  They have all the money they need.
[00:06:37.377 --> 00:06:38.058]  They're after power.
[00:06:38.338 --> 00:06:39.018]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:44.022]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[00:06:51.026 --> 00:06:52.067]  You have been warned.
[00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:59.977]  Are you tired of hearing that a cure for cancer is coming, but it will be available sometime in the future?
[00:07:00.338 --> 00:07:02.601]  At LaysMedInc, the future is here.
[00:07:02.981 --> 00:07:06.426]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with our patented methodology.
[00:07:06.646 --> 00:07:09.570]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs or damaging radiation.

[00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:40.171]  That's L-A-S-E-M-E-D-I-N-C dot com today.
[00:07:57.816 --> 00:08:01.999]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:03.460]  You want answers?
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.141]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:05.781 --> 00:08:09.384]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:09.984 --> 00:08:14.087]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:16.468 --> 00:08:18.290]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we are back.
[00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:21.512]  It is the 4th of July, 2008, Independence Day.
[00:08:24.827 --> 00:08:33.891]  And coming up, we're going to be talking about some street actions out in Philadelphia, Liberty Bell stuff, I mean, the actual Founding Fathers stuff, folks, and people are doing it.
[00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:40.434]  And that's what 9-11 Chronicles Truth Rising, this is just part one, by the way, is all about.
[00:08:40.754 --> 00:08:50.378]  It's all about showing you that we have incredible power, that the 9-11 Truth Movement is many different people, and we can make a difference.
[00:08:50.398 --> 00:08:50.898]  Let me say it again.
[00:08:51.298 --> 00:08:53.219]  We can make a difference.
[00:08:54.076 --> 00:08:57.597]  And it's these different groups that are doing amazing, amazing things.
[00:08:59.138 --> 00:09:18.704]  For instance, Luke Rudowsky shows you how somebody who's not even old enough to drink, let me say that again, can't even buy a beer in a bar, folks, when he started doing this, can confront global elitists, global tyrants, such as Zygmunt Brzezinski, okay?
[00:09:18.824 --> 00:09:19.304]  Big time.
[00:09:19.664 --> 00:09:22.065]  David Rockefeller, one of the top guys at the apex.
[00:09:23.922 --> 00:09:24.222]  Alright?
[00:09:25.643 --> 00:09:26.543]  Michael Bloomberg.
[00:09:27.003 --> 00:09:28.043]  Michael Bloomberg alone.
[00:09:28.103 --> 00:09:30.504]  I can't... Do you understand how much power that man has?
[00:09:31.365 --> 00:09:31.965]  Billionaire?
[00:09:32.025 --> 00:09:32.665]  Bloomberg?
[00:09:33.305 --> 00:09:33.625]  Come on.
[00:09:34.206 --> 00:09:34.786]  Get with it.
[00:09:36.126 --> 00:09:36.866]  Mayor of New York.
[00:09:38.427 --> 00:09:39.107]  It's incredible.
[00:09:39.127 --> 00:09:43.069]  I mean, he gets on the subway and all this stuff, by the way, is in 9-11 Chronicles Truth Rising.
[00:09:44.429 --> 00:09:48.090]  Among other great stuff, I mean, I just want to talk about the activism right now.
[00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:49.911]  I mean, Gary Hart, former senator,
[00:09:50.575 --> 00:09:51.275]  We're good to go.
[00:10:20.367 --> 00:10:21.107]  It's unbelievable.
[00:10:21.628 --> 00:10:22.528]  It's like doublespeak.
[00:10:23.349 --> 00:10:26.811]  It's like as long as he denies that he's not agreeing with the guy, he can agree with him.
[00:10:28.752 --> 00:10:32.734]  And I want people to get this film over at PrisonPlanet.tv in super high quality.
[00:10:32.775 --> 00:10:35.396]  Again, the DivX versions are all fixed.
[00:10:35.836 --> 00:10:40.659]  If you're having any kind of problem, I would say go to Download.com and get the latest version of the codec.
[00:10:40.679 --> 00:10:42.701]  Some people were saying they could only hear the audio.
[00:10:42.721 --> 00:10:44.301]  That means you don't have the correct video codec.
[00:10:44.322 --> 00:10:45.862]  You're probably running on Windows 2000 or Windows
[00:10:48.204 --> 00:10:48.724]  98, possibly.
[00:10:48.764 --> 00:10:49.024]  God.
[00:10:49.184 --> 00:10:50.185]  Or maybe even ME.
[00:10:50.325 --> 00:10:51.206]  God, remember those days?
[00:10:51.386 --> 00:10:53.207]  Folks, I guess they're not that far away.
[00:10:53.428 --> 00:10:55.149]  I used to run on those operating systems, too.
[00:10:55.529 --> 00:10:59.332]  But XP and Vista, it's built into the latest Windows Media Player.
[00:10:59.372 --> 00:11:00.113]  It should play great.
[00:11:00.593 --> 00:11:02.154]  Again, the quality is super high.
[00:11:02.194 --> 00:11:06.498]  Probably the highest we've ever offered any of Alex Jones' films.
[00:11:07.318 --> 00:11:12.482]  And the film, again, is unlike anything else Alex Jones has ever done.
[00:11:13.143 --> 00:11:13.863]  Ever, ever, ever.
[00:11:14.063 --> 00:11:16.185]  In fact, we should go and read some comments.
[00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:19.732]  On what people are saying about Truth Rising.
[00:11:19.752 --> 00:11:21.833]  I mean, it was getting five stars all over the place.
[00:11:22.174 --> 00:11:23.114]  It's spreading about.
[00:11:23.595 --> 00:11:24.356]  It's unbelievable.
[00:11:25.536 --> 00:11:27.818]  You know, and for a brief second, I want to talk about another movie.
[00:11:28.379 --> 00:11:35.745]  I go out on these file sharing networks quite a bit to get news, documentaries, PBS stuff, HDNet.
[00:11:36.105 --> 00:11:38.367]  In other words, like, you know, Dan Rather's news footage.
[00:11:40.669 --> 00:11:41.690]  And check out what's popular.
[00:11:42.611 --> 00:11:43.572]  See what the kids are watching.
[00:11:44.552 --> 00:11:44.813]  Well, on
[00:11:45.492 --> 00:11:46.533]  Some of the most popular ones.
[00:11:46.613 --> 00:11:51.116]  Loose Change Final Cut has around 10,000 seeders and 15,000 leechers.
[00:11:51.136 --> 00:11:51.696]  And that's great.
[00:11:51.716 --> 00:11:52.437]  That's unbelievable.
[00:11:52.477 --> 00:11:54.919]  That's, you know, tops.
[00:11:55.079 --> 00:11:59.722]  I mean, that's one of the top torrents probably in the few first hundred or thousand.
[00:11:59.742 --> 00:12:00.122]  That's great.
[00:12:00.583 --> 00:12:07.507]  However, in the top three, I mean, the third most popular torrent out there right now that I'm seeing is America Freedom to Fascism.
[00:12:08.068 --> 00:12:10.009]  Aaron Russo's amazing picture.
[00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:14.112]  Now you can get over here at the shop at InfoWars.com, by the way.
[00:12:15.663 --> 00:12:26.611]  And I'm just like, wow, so I'm reading some of these comments and these people are just shocked and amazed and to have 44,000 seeders is really almost unheard of the top Hollywood downloads.
[00:12:26.991 --> 00:12:29.933]  In other words, all the illegal rips out there don't get that many seeders.
[00:12:30.493 --> 00:12:33.856]  So whoever's seen that movie, thank you so much.
[00:12:34.696 --> 00:12:36.478]  And, uh, keep doing it.
[00:12:36.558 --> 00:12:37.598]  That's how we spread the truth.
[00:12:37.659 --> 00:12:42.482]  We, we communicate through the ways we know how it's not just about, you know, going in,
[00:12:43.863 --> 00:12:45.503]  And, uh, typing on a message board.
[00:12:45.723 --> 00:12:47.464]  It's about providing people with the information.
[00:12:47.524 --> 00:12:48.624]  It's about knocking on doors.
[00:12:48.704 --> 00:12:49.864]  It's about today.
[00:12:50.565 --> 00:12:50.965]  Today.
[00:12:51.965 --> 00:12:52.825]  The 4th of July.
[00:12:52.885 --> 00:12:54.586]  Many of you are in a car right now.
[00:12:54.786 --> 00:12:56.406]  On your way to the family.
[00:12:57.386 --> 00:12:59.007]  Or listening to your shortwave in your backyard.
[00:12:59.847 --> 00:13:01.147]  Getting ready to throw a barbecue.
[00:13:02.627 --> 00:13:04.288]  Or on the internet, pumping it on a speaker.
[00:13:05.588 --> 00:13:07.689]  And again, getting ready to greet your friends and family.
[00:13:07.729 --> 00:13:08.429]  Today's the day!
[00:13:08.969 --> 00:13:09.989]  To talk about this stuff.
[00:13:10.669 --> 00:13:13.390]  It's not just a day to barbecue and hang back, folks.
[00:13:14.241 --> 00:13:15.162]  Let me give you an example.
[00:13:15.982 --> 00:13:17.123]  I was out for the last week.
[00:13:17.163 --> 00:13:18.805]  I went out to New York.
[00:13:19.125 --> 00:13:19.926]  Good friend's wedding.
[00:13:20.906 --> 00:13:24.309]  I actually blogged about this experience because it was so heartening.
[00:13:24.849 --> 00:13:26.471]  I can't even tell you how heartening it was.
[00:13:26.491 --> 00:13:31.295]  It was basically a big get-together of people that I've known since I was yay high.
[00:13:31.315 --> 00:13:32.355]  I was like 12 years old.
[00:13:34.577 --> 00:13:35.778]  One of my friends was getting married.
[00:13:36.038 --> 00:13:37.520]  Of course, we're almost rocking 30 now.
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:38.160]  We're old people.
[00:13:39.641 --> 00:13:40.922]  I've been harping on this stuff since 2002.
[00:13:42.847 --> 00:13:48.389]  So to start off with, I ride up to this wedding up at the Thousand Islands, which is gorgeous, by the way, in New York.
[00:13:50.449 --> 00:14:03.113]  And I'm riding with my friend who's now a school teacher at my old school that I went to, and my other buddy who was ex-military, spent four years in the Army, and just missed going to Iraq.
[00:14:03.313 --> 00:14:04.553]  Thank God he didn't have to go.
[00:14:05.613 --> 00:14:06.034]  Thank God.
[00:14:06.334 --> 00:14:06.974]  Geez, man.
[00:14:06.994 --> 00:14:11.115]  One of my other buddies that I'll talk about later did have to go, of course, and boy, did that change his life.
[00:14:12.168 --> 00:14:15.710]  Anyway, he also worked TSA over in LaGuardia for about five years.
[00:14:16.691 --> 00:14:25.376]  And I've had talks with this guy before, and he's talked about the drills that they run, and the times that they have been able to get explosives through, or mock explosives, and he says it's always a drill.
[00:14:25.416 --> 00:14:28.278]  He's never caught a real terrorist out there, but that's besides the point.
[00:14:28.298 --> 00:14:32.821]  So, back in 2002, when I'm talking about this stuff, they had no idea.
[00:14:32.921 --> 00:14:35.743]  Jason, if this was true, everybody would know about it.
[00:14:35.803 --> 00:14:36.903]  Why is it secret?
[00:14:36.943 --> 00:14:37.844]  I don't understand.
[00:14:39.824 --> 00:14:41.665]  Well, it's the complete opposite.
[00:14:41.725 --> 00:14:45.447]  My friend just got done reading Behold the Pale Horse by William Cooper.
[00:14:47.187 --> 00:14:51.930]  Although I don't agree with everything in there, I think there is some good information in William Cooper's material.
[00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.011]  And he's like, this stuff is blowing my mind.
[00:14:54.051 --> 00:14:55.871]  He was reading a couple of Jim Mars books.
[00:14:56.672 --> 00:15:00.213]  They'd both seen, of course, my film, Alex's film.
[00:15:01.314 --> 00:15:03.775]  My one friend, Matt, had just seen Road to Tyranny.
[00:15:03.855 --> 00:15:04.976]  And he was like, man.
[00:15:05.516 --> 00:15:06.596]  He's like, I couldn't sleep.
[00:15:06.636 --> 00:15:08.037]  That film really scared me.
[00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:14.842]  And I'm like, yeah, it's scary material and that's what happened to me back in 2002 when I was trying to get you to watch that movie.
[00:15:16.502 --> 00:15:27.065]  So anyway, we get up to the Thousand Islands and I'm rooming with my other buddy from the military who did go to Iraq, my brother from another mother, Jason, another Jason.
[00:15:27.825 --> 00:15:28.725]  I like to call him Dino.
[00:15:30.906 --> 00:15:32.246]  And just a great time.
[00:15:32.286 --> 00:15:34.527]  And even talking to him, it seemed like he had woken up.
[00:15:34.567 --> 00:15:35.787]  He, you know, he doesn't
[00:15:36.618 --> 00:15:44.659]  He doesn't necessarily agree with me, but he knows that I seem to know a lot more about politics and he's just one of those guys who says, look man, I just want to take the blue pill.
[00:15:45.039 --> 00:15:46.120]  I don't want the red pill.
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.060]  I need the blue pill.
[00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.101]  I, uh, I can't handle this stuff.
[00:15:51.601 --> 00:15:53.761]  He's like, you know, I went overseas, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:15:54.661 --> 00:15:56.441]  But I told, I showed him a couple of videos.
[00:15:56.501 --> 00:15:59.302]  I showed him, uh, John Kansias and Saltwater Burns.
[00:15:59.582 --> 00:16:01.662]  And I wish that Alex had brought that up with David Icke.
[00:16:01.702 --> 00:16:05.423]  Maybe the next time David Icke's on, we can talk about frequencies and John Kansias.
[00:16:05.811 --> 00:16:08.312]  For those of you who don't know about that, check it out, Saltwater Burns.
[00:16:09.712 --> 00:16:15.334]  But anyway, the wedding that we went to on top of this was a totally Republican wedding.
[00:16:16.034 --> 00:16:24.517]  And by Republican wedding, I mean my friend who was getting married, she worked for Pataki's office for quite some time, so did her soon-to-be husband, who she married.
[00:16:25.497 --> 00:16:26.377]  I think that's where they met.
[00:16:27.497 --> 00:16:30.938]  Her father was my guidance counselor, total right-wing nutjob.
[00:16:33.186 --> 00:16:35.246]  It just, it was, it was funny, you know, the situation.
[00:16:35.326 --> 00:16:40.047]  But, me being me, I gave her a stack of movies as the gift.
[00:16:41.268 --> 00:16:51.670]  And I think I gave her, like, 15 or so movies, including, you know, LCFC, American Drug War, Washington, You're Fired, some of the loose DVDs that were around the office, of course, Endgame.
[00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:54.651]  My buddy, Nanofrio, also took an Endgame, by the way.
[00:16:55.751 --> 00:16:59.332]  So, I get back from the wedding, and all of a sudden, I get a phone call from my friend, Heidi.
[00:17:00.552 --> 00:17:01.072]  And she's like,
[00:17:01.758 --> 00:17:03.799]  I just want to thank you so much for the gift.
[00:17:03.919 --> 00:17:05.199]  We all think it's hilarious.
[00:17:05.239 --> 00:17:07.320]  And I'm like, well, you know, I gave you some money too.
[00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:08.561]  She's like, no, no, no, I know.
[00:17:08.581 --> 00:17:09.901]  She's like, but I think this is great.
[00:17:10.181 --> 00:17:11.642]  She's like, my entire family's here.
[00:17:11.962 --> 00:17:13.243]  We're going to pop in and lose change.
[00:17:14.123 --> 00:17:14.603]  And they did.
[00:17:15.383 --> 00:17:25.127]  And I just think that's a huge win that people that would normally just scoff at this stuff or laugh at this stuff got together at a family organ.
[00:17:25.307 --> 00:17:27.288]  There's nothing more family than a wedding, by the way.
[00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:28.649]  All right.
[00:17:29.069 --> 00:17:31.490]  I mean, that's going to even surpass the 4th of July.
[00:17:32.537 --> 00:17:34.458]  You know, you're going to have a lot of family there.
[00:17:34.678 --> 00:17:36.419]  And they sat down and watched my film.
[00:17:37.139 --> 00:17:42.341]  I still have to get a review, but I'm sure a lot of them were in for the shock of their lives.
[00:17:42.661 --> 00:17:42.941]  You know?
[00:17:45.603 --> 00:17:46.303]  I can't imagine.
[00:17:46.343 --> 00:17:47.563]  But today is that day for you.
[00:17:47.824 --> 00:17:48.484]  Do you understand?
[00:17:48.564 --> 00:17:49.744]  Today is that day for you.
[00:17:49.964 --> 00:17:56.367]  When your uncle, your aunt, your cousin, your brother, your nephew, your niece come over today.
[00:17:56.407 --> 00:17:57.228]  Your best friend.
[00:17:58.348 --> 00:18:00.489]  Your local buddy at the workplace.
[00:18:01.212 --> 00:18:08.134]  You know, it doesn't have to all be about this, but it doesn't all have to be about, you know, what's going on in Major League Baseball either.
[00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:10.494]  Yeah, I caught a Yankees game while I was home.
[00:18:10.994 --> 00:18:11.835]  That's okay too.
[00:18:11.875 --> 00:18:12.835]  You can throw that on later.
[00:18:12.855 --> 00:18:15.956]  But again, for me, this has to be primary.
[00:18:16.016 --> 00:18:18.436]  How else are we going to win unless this is primary?
[00:18:19.636 --> 00:18:19.956]  Alright.
[00:18:20.737 --> 00:18:21.457]  Let's see.
[00:18:22.557 --> 00:18:23.477]  Let's read some of this.
[00:18:24.157 --> 00:18:27.178]  Let's read some of these 9-11 Truth Rising reviews.
[00:18:27.238 --> 00:18:30.659]  Guys, it's, again, unbelievable movie.
[00:18:31.684 --> 00:18:35.765]  Almost two hours long, super high-quality, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:18:36.526 --> 00:18:39.387]  By the way, PrisonPlanet.TV is about 15 cents a day, folks.
[00:18:40.427 --> 00:18:45.488]  And if you're not on to get Prison Planet material, you need to be.
[00:18:45.528 --> 00:18:47.129]  I mean, this is 15 cents a day.
[00:18:47.369 --> 00:18:48.509]  Can you get any cheaper?
[00:18:48.589 --> 00:18:52.431]  It's about a cup of coffee a week, and not really, because Starbucks is like four or five bucks a cup.
[00:18:56.032 --> 00:18:59.553]  But, you get all Alex Jones' movies,
[00:19:00.384 --> 00:19:06.770]  You can get his weekly TV show, which has a bunch of material in it that doesn't make his movies, that is just as interesting and intricate.
[00:19:07.091 --> 00:19:12.536]  See, I guess when you're on the outside looking in, you don't really realize how much material is in this little office.
[00:19:13.517 --> 00:19:18.802]  But there are literally binders, I mean binders, of stuff that is just incredible.
[00:19:19.963 --> 00:19:23.907]  And, uh, I'm gonna be scamming some of that stuff for the new movie, Fabled Enemies, that's on the way.
[00:19:26.129 --> 00:19:34.541]  But folks, I want to encourage you right now, right now, go to Infowars.com, click on the 9-11 Chronicles banner, and go check it out.
[00:19:34.781 --> 00:19:35.502]  Truth Rising.
[00:19:35.782 --> 00:19:36.663]  It's happening today.
[00:19:36.804 --> 00:19:38.306]  Independence Day, the 4th of July, 2008.
[00:19:38.386 --> 00:19:40.148]  We'll be back after this.
[00:19:40.208 --> 00:19:41.089]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:55.393 --> 00:19:56.434]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:19:56.835 --> 00:20:02.320]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:03.401]  That's right.
[00:20:03.721 --> 00:20:06.384]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:20:07.405 --> 00:20:13.491]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:20:14.031 --> 00:20:21.716]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:20:22.176 --> 00:20:27.039]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:20:27.659 --> 00:20:32.682]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:33.462 --> 00:20:37.585]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:20:37.985 --> 00:20:38.245]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:38.265 --> 00:20:40.086]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:20:43.328 --> 00:20:43.589]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:43.609 --> 00:20:43.809]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:20:54.164 --> 00:20:56.046]  Gas prices are out of control!
[00:20:56.487 --> 00:21:00.151]  Fight back by doing what thousands of listeners to the Alex Jones Show have done.
[00:21:00.371 --> 00:21:03.114]  Developed by a major oil company, a product that really works.
[00:21:03.435 --> 00:21:07.039]  Introducing SFR's Protecta Complete fuel system and engine treatment.
[00:21:07.199 --> 00:21:09.762]  Just one bottle increases mileage for up to six months.
[00:21:09.942 --> 00:21:13.486]  Fleet tested by major oil companies showing improvements in every car tested.
[00:21:13.706 --> 00:21:17.207]  Stop paying mechanics your hard-earned money to have your injection system cleaned.
[00:21:17.407 --> 00:21:23.089]  Protecta cleans up to 95% of new injector condition in just one tankful and is safe for all cars.
[00:21:23.269 --> 00:21:30.472]  Tests conducted by General Motors conclude fuel injectors can partially plug in as little as 5,000 miles due to poor gasoline quality.
[00:21:30.732 --> 00:21:37.575]  Fight high fuel prices by purchasing a Protecta fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive an engine treatment free at $12.95 value.
[00:21:38.775 --> 00:21:45.341]  Satisfaction guaranteed or your money back, go to oilcompanysecret.com, that's oilcompanysecret.com, or call 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:21:45.461 --> 00:21:45.641]  That's 888-873-7371.
[00:21:53.550 --> 00:22:03.976]  When I learned that the accumulation of acidic waste was the likely cause of my painful joints, lack of energy, and weight gain, I knew I would have to change to a more alkaline diet, but it just seemed so difficult.
[00:22:04.296 --> 00:22:13.761]  Then a friend suggested I try a Jupiter water ionizer from SnyderHealth.com and detox my body even before I changed my diet by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[00:22:14.121 --> 00:22:14.882]  Drinking water?
[00:22:15.382 --> 00:22:16.683]  Now that's something I can handle.
[00:22:17.063 --> 00:22:22.426]  The guys at Snyder Health took the time to explain all of the different options and help me choose the ionizer that was right for me.
[00:22:22.726 --> 00:22:25.048]  I use my new Jupiter ionizer for everything.
[00:22:25.148 --> 00:22:34.533]  For drinking, for cooking, and since I've been drinking the water, I have more energy, my joint pains are gone, and I already lost 7 pounds, and my skin looks great!
[00:22:34.833 --> 00:22:37.475]  Give them a call today at 877-356-2508 to find out which ionizer is right for you.

[00:22:53.177 --> 00:22:55.238]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:22:55.338 --> 00:22:57.740]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.901]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:23:00.061 --> 00:23:01.562]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:23:01.582 --> 00:23:03.183]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:23:03.283 --> 00:23:06.085]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[00:23:06.105 --> 00:23:10.568]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR, the...
[00:23:12.509 --> 00:23:19.438]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[00:23:19.478 --> 00:23:23.964]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:23:24.004 --> 00:23:25.506]  An inside job.
[00:23:28.163 --> 00:23:30.424]  How dare you?
[00:23:30.585 --> 00:23:35.648]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:23:35.668 --> 00:23:38.089]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:23:38.129 --> 00:23:44.973]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[00:23:45.033 --> 00:23:47.615]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[00:23:47.875 --> 00:23:49.876]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:23:50.136 --> 00:23:52.598]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:57.952]  Come, your master's at war.
[00:23:57.972 --> 00:24:02.376]  He'll build the big guns.
[00:24:04.758 --> 00:24:07.160]  He'll build the death planes.
[00:24:09.081 --> 00:24:11.043]  He'll build all the bombs.
[00:24:13.425 --> 00:24:15.887]  He'll hide behind walls.
[00:24:17.749 --> 00:24:19.851]  He'll hide behind disks.
[00:24:21.969 --> 00:24:26.152]  I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
[00:24:28.534 --> 00:24:34.899]  You that never done nothing but build to destroy.
[00:24:37.261 --> 00:24:43.486]  You play with my world like it's your little toy.
[00:24:45.748 --> 00:24:47.930]  You put a gun in my hand
[00:24:50.163 --> 00:24:52.426]  And you hide from my eyes.
[00:24:54.568 --> 00:24:58.833]  And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.
[00:24:59.213 --> 00:25:00.474]  Alright folks, we're back!
[00:25:01.215 --> 00:25:03.277]  Like a Judas of old.
[00:25:03.297 --> 00:25:04.819]  It's the 4th of July.
[00:25:05.019 --> 00:25:06.080]  Not like a little villain, huh?
[00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:07.522]  You lie and deceive.
[00:25:07.542 --> 00:25:11.847]  A world war can be won.
[00:25:12.819 --> 00:25:13.299]  You know it.
[00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:17.602]  Folks, it's a day for barbecues.
[00:25:17.662 --> 00:25:18.522]  It's a day for family.
[00:25:18.542 --> 00:25:19.623]  It's a day for hot dogs.
[00:25:20.463 --> 00:25:24.906]  It's a day for fireworks.
[00:25:25.886 --> 00:25:29.869]  It's a day where we can all get together.
[00:25:29.889 --> 00:25:32.890]  But for me, it's a day for the truth to rise.
[00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:34.151]  It's time to rise up.
[00:25:34.651 --> 00:25:35.872]  It's time to get busy.
[00:25:38.681 --> 00:25:42.823]  We are T-minus two days away from another attack by the BBC.
[00:25:43.603 --> 00:25:44.283]  Alright?
[00:25:44.303 --> 00:25:45.124]  Let me say that again.
[00:25:45.324 --> 00:25:50.786]  We're T-minus two more days away from an attack by the BBC.
[00:25:51.986 --> 00:25:58.949]  And I just want to shout out to that punk, Mike Rudin, who's putting out this blog already trying to make us look bad.
[00:25:58.989 --> 00:26:00.209]  This guy, yo.
[00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:03.490]  First of all, he's the one that interviewed Dylan.
[00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:05.651]  Apparently he's the producer of this piece.
[00:26:06.542 --> 00:26:10.683]  I talked to him for about a half an hour when we were out in Colorado.
[00:26:11.624 --> 00:26:12.404]  And he's total scum.
[00:26:13.124 --> 00:26:13.985]  I'll say that right now.
[00:26:14.045 --> 00:26:15.345]  I have no respect for the man.
[00:26:15.745 --> 00:26:17.006]  He is a cover-up artist.
[00:26:17.086 --> 00:26:19.286]  I guarantee this piece is not going to be fair.
[00:26:19.506 --> 00:26:24.208]  They're going to explain to us how damage caused Building 7 come down.
[00:26:24.368 --> 00:26:27.009]  Whether that's true or not, that's what he's going to explain.
[00:26:27.069 --> 00:26:27.789]  That is his goal.
[00:26:28.249 --> 00:26:29.330]  Do not fool yourselves.
[00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:30.190]  Alright?
[00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:32.311]  I've read a lot of these comments.
[00:26:33.283 --> 00:26:38.104]  Uh, blogger, and even over on InfoWars about certain things, and let me tell you something right now.
[00:26:38.184 --> 00:26:39.484]  The BBC is not our friend.
[00:26:39.724 --> 00:26:41.305]  Stop acting like they're our friend.
[00:26:42.205 --> 00:26:42.505]  Okay?
[00:26:42.525 --> 00:26:43.365]  Because they're not!
[00:26:44.165 --> 00:26:46.866]  The conspiracy files are not our friend!
[00:26:46.886 --> 00:26:50.527]  When are you gonna wake up, people?
[00:26:52.167 --> 00:26:54.268]  You really think they're gonna give a legit shot to us?
[00:26:54.368 --> 00:26:54.888]  I mean, really?
[00:26:54.968 --> 00:26:58.288]  After that horrifying hit piece of total lies?
[00:26:59.629 --> 00:27:00.449]  Let me give an example.
[00:27:01.269 --> 00:27:07.074]  A really simple example of how they totally and completely distorted their first 9-11 special.
[00:27:08.675 --> 00:27:20.524]  Okay, they go to, they act like we all went to Google Maps or MapQuest and mapped out where Indian Lake was in relation to the Flight 93 Shanksville crash.
[00:27:22.206 --> 00:27:22.406]  Right?
[00:27:22.706 --> 00:27:23.106]  Remember that?
[00:27:24.467 --> 00:27:27.570]  And they said, yeah, it's a six to eight mile drive.
[00:27:28.559 --> 00:27:30.480]  But it's really only one to two miles away.
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:31.081]  Debunked!
[00:27:32.361 --> 00:27:32.602]  No.
[00:27:33.322 --> 00:27:34.643]  Let's go over the real facts.
[00:27:35.143 --> 00:27:39.826]  They didn't want to go over the fact there is no plane in an open field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
[00:27:40.046 --> 00:27:40.407]  Period.
[00:27:40.787 --> 00:27:41.307]  Let me say it again.
[00:27:41.487 --> 00:27:45.050]  There is no plane in an open field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
[00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:46.450]  There are no engines.
[00:27:47.171 --> 00:27:49.292]  There are no pieces of fuselage.
[00:27:49.733 --> 00:27:50.353]  There's nothing.
[00:27:50.953 --> 00:27:52.374]  There's no bodies.
[00:27:53.095 --> 00:27:53.355]  Okay?
[00:27:53.635 --> 00:27:56.677]  Both Ernie Stahl, the mayor of Shanksville when he got there,
[00:27:57.498 --> 00:28:00.719]  was told that the plane disintegrated on impact into the ground.
[00:28:00.939 --> 00:28:01.179]  Okay?
[00:28:01.199 --> 00:28:02.020]  That's what they told him.
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:10.202]  The mayor of Indian Lake, when he got there, who we interviewed ourselves, said he wouldn't have known a plane had crashed there unless they told him.
[00:28:11.303 --> 00:28:11.623]  Okay?
[00:28:11.903 --> 00:28:12.603]  Let me go over it again.
[00:28:14.804 --> 00:28:22.907]  Even when Lifetime Network did their little Flight 93 movie, when the FBI agents get there, they ask the firefighters where the plane is.
[00:28:23.367 --> 00:28:24.767]  And they go, we don't know.
[00:28:25.008 --> 00:28:26.148]  Maybe you can help us find it.
[00:28:26.753 --> 00:28:27.694]  It's a plane!
[00:28:27.934 --> 00:28:28.655]  It's a seven!
[00:28:28.675 --> 00:28:29.676]  Oh my God!
[00:28:29.816 --> 00:28:30.757]  It's a jumbo jet!
[00:28:31.017 --> 00:28:31.537]  Oh my God!
[00:28:33.079 --> 00:28:35.321]  And then you have these little smaller debris areas.
[00:28:36.281 --> 00:28:43.528]  And then you have reports of smaller debris falling eight miles away over a mountain ridge in New Baltimore.
[00:28:43.548 --> 00:28:44.528]  Let me say it again.
[00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:50.794]  Eight miles away over a mountain ridge in New Baltimore.
[00:28:53.516 --> 00:28:54.337]  They didn't bring that up.
[00:28:56.206 --> 00:28:57.646]  But you're right, the BBC's our buddy.
[00:28:57.747 --> 00:28:58.607]  They're gonna be awesome.
[00:29:01.628 --> 00:29:02.628]  Keep dreaming, folks.
[00:29:03.508 --> 00:29:04.549]  Keep dreaming.
[00:29:05.429 --> 00:29:12.571]  They had... Listen, they had Davin Coburn and James Meggs as two of their main experts.
[00:29:13.191 --> 00:29:18.813]  James Meggs is the ex, uh, chief editor of Entertainment Weekly.
[00:29:19.373 --> 00:29:24.035]  So you can drool over your television set and your movie theater when you're not even there when you're reading.
[00:29:24.713 --> 00:29:25.974]  Yeah, that sounds real constructive.
[00:29:26.074 --> 00:29:27.195]  James Meigs is an expert.
[00:29:28.475 --> 00:29:29.316]  We'll be back after this.
[00:29:29.376 --> 00:29:31.697]  It's the Alex Jones Show with Philly 9-11 Truth.
[00:29:31.997 --> 00:29:33.238]  Truth Rising is out!
[00:29:33.418 --> 00:29:34.859]  PrisonPlanet.tv!
[00:29:43.484 --> 00:29:44.385]  We're on the march.
[00:29:44.885 --> 00:29:46.486]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:47.407 --> 00:29:50.108]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:54.207 --> 00:29:55.868]  Life has changed.
[00:29:56.268 --> 00:29:57.729]  We're not 21 anymore.
[00:29:58.109 --> 00:29:59.850]  We have responsibilities.
[00:30:01.271 --> 00:30:03.752]  That's why there's drinkin' made hangover defense.
[00:30:04.212 --> 00:30:05.813]  Sure, we've done our share of partying.
[00:30:05.893 --> 00:30:06.634]  Yeah, dude.
[00:30:06.694 --> 00:30:10.256]  Now, kickin' back with the neighbors and a few beers is more our style.
[00:30:10.836 --> 00:30:16.239]  But let's face it, as we get older, even that can leave us feeling run down the next morning.
[00:30:17.185 --> 00:30:21.827]  With Drink and Mate, you can have a few drinks tonight without waking up feeling like you had a few.
[00:30:22.167 --> 00:30:33.351]  Drink and Mate's patented and proven formula of guava leaf extract has antioxidants and other unique properties that help prevent the headache, queasy stomach, and dehydration even a few drinks can leave behind.
[00:30:33.871 --> 00:30:37.432]  Just dissolve one Drink and Mate in water and take it before bed.
[00:30:37.713 --> 00:30:38.313]  It's that easy!
[00:30:39.181 --> 00:30:41.502]  The next morning, bring on the responsibilities!
[00:30:43.103 --> 00:30:46.565]  Drink and Mate Hangover Defense is available at retailers nationwide.

[00:33:07.906 --> 00:33:08.410]  Yeah.
[00:33:26.921 --> 00:33:28.962]  Alright folks, we're back!
[00:33:29.242 --> 00:33:33.824]  It's Independence Day, it's the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:52.436]  Let me read you off a couple quotes of what the Prison Plans Act TV members are saying about the latest film from Alex Jones.
[00:33:52.696 --> 00:33:54.538]  There are no slow points in the film.
[00:33:54.658 --> 00:33:58.683]  Alex and his crew were absolutely successful at producing the movie.
[00:33:59.163 --> 00:34:01.746]  My eyes were glued to the screen through the entire film.
[00:34:02.166 --> 00:34:03.648]  I think I will watch it again.
[00:34:05.154 --> 00:34:09.496]  Excellent, I was able to download both DivX and MOV, high quality, in about an hour.
[00:34:09.796 --> 00:34:14.197]  I must say the film is one of, if not the best film Alex Jones has ever made.
[00:34:14.217 --> 00:34:17.538]  It is truly the best guide to activism I have ever seen.
[00:34:17.738 --> 00:34:19.399]  And that's what it's about folks, it's activating.
[00:34:19.839 --> 00:34:21.840]  You know, we don't need a bunch of armchair quarterbacks.
[00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:25.981]  I recommend that the film be disseminated now, the time is running short.
[00:34:26.362 --> 00:34:27.562]  Death to the New World Order!
[00:34:28.607 --> 00:34:31.428]  I am now an hour into the film and I have to say, Alex nailed it!
[00:34:31.728 --> 00:34:34.148]  Cinema Verite is definitely the way to go to tell this story.
[00:34:34.408 --> 00:34:36.829]  I bet this film wakes up more people than Loose Change.
[00:34:38.089 --> 00:34:43.230]  Nobody should have any hesitation in sharing this with unawake friends and family members.
[00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:49.351]  The film is sharing a very compelling human interest story, one that is the most difficult to ignore than any previous 9-11 doc.
[00:34:49.391 --> 00:34:58.353]  That's right, if you have a good connection, you're a PrisonPlanet.tv member, you got a DivX DVD player, you can literally download it and burn it in about an hour, hour and a half, and share it with your family.
[00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:03.365]  We're out on Independence Mall, which is about 1,000 yards or so away from Independence Hall.
[00:35:18.211 --> 00:35:20.753]  They've set up free speech zones down here.
[00:35:20.773 --> 00:35:26.939]  Another violation of everything that this country was founded on, on the birthday of this country.
[00:35:26.979 --> 00:35:28.020]  It's a real travesty.
[00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:33.965]  It's a real affront to everything that our forefathers and mothers fought for to bring to this country.
[00:35:34.205 --> 00:35:36.387]  And it's just really sad.
[00:35:36.447 --> 00:35:38.368]  I have a stinking feeling in my stomach right now.
[00:35:38.909 --> 00:35:41.611]  But there is a good deal of resistance out here.
[00:35:41.631 --> 00:35:45.835]  We're seeing more this year than the last when we had our event in the Independence
[00:35:46.286 --> 00:35:46.687]  All right.
[00:35:56.784 --> 00:35:59.385]  9-11 Truth and there's also anti-war activists out here.
[00:35:59.545 --> 00:36:03.907]  But really what's happening is that they're requiring folks to get a permit.
[00:36:03.967 --> 00:36:05.247]  It's not even a free speech zone.
[00:36:05.287 --> 00:36:08.308]  It's also duly so that you need to get a permit to be out here.
[00:36:08.328 --> 00:36:16.011]  So we're sort of just piggybacking off of the MAMEA folks at this point in time, waiting until they come over to us and ask us for our papers.
[00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:30.610]  Yeah, absolutely, and it's just so encouraging to me that you guys are actually out there doing something, showing that even though they are trying to restrict our free speech, trying to restrict our freedoms, as free humanity, man, that's what this is about.
[00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:35.494]  It's about us being able to be secure in our persons and possessions.
[00:36:36.332 --> 00:36:38.433]  And, you know, a government formed by the people.
[00:36:38.493 --> 00:36:39.393]  We no longer have that.
[00:36:39.713 --> 00:36:42.153]  We have restrictions on our First Amendment.
[00:36:42.173 --> 00:36:43.914]  You're not allowed to be near Independence Hall.
[00:36:43.954 --> 00:36:46.154]  You have to be at Independence Mall, apparently.
[00:36:46.595 --> 00:36:52.736]  But I am glad you're on the scene of where some of the most encouraging things have happened in this history.
[00:36:53.036 --> 00:36:57.517]  Really, when free men broke away from a tyrannical system over 200 years ago.
[00:36:58.918 --> 00:36:59.138]  Right.
[00:36:59.318 --> 00:37:00.278]  Yeah, it's definitely the case.
[00:37:00.954 --> 00:37:17.081]  And, um, last week we just saw, we saw another major action against the First Amendment, where, uh, this, this local municipal government, the police force, arrested a gentleman for standing, uh, somewhere in the vicinity of the Liberty Bell and reading off, uh, verses out of the Bible.
[00:37:17.361 --> 00:37:18.201]  He was arrested.
[00:37:18.541 --> 00:37:25.484]  And, uh, now that gentleman has since been banned from coming anywhere near Independence Mall or the Liberty Bell for one year.
[00:37:25.884 --> 00:37:29.846]  One year for reading passages out of the Bible for his free speech, his First Amendment.
[00:37:30.026 --> 00:37:42.565]  Yeah, I actually got to interview him I think it was about two weeks ago when I was filling in for Alex and it's just unbelievable that once again, you know, we're supposed to be able to go down the public streets and proclaim the truth.
[00:37:42.864 --> 00:37:44.864]  That's what this country was founded on.
[00:37:45.105 --> 00:37:47.265]  In fact, you know, Martin Luther King Jr.
[00:37:47.305 --> 00:37:55.107]  was so successful because he had people take to the streets and they were the ones handing out the pamphlets and the literature and it was person-to-person.
[00:37:55.607 --> 00:38:01.548]  And now you look at what happens to We Are Change Colorado when they're out in front of a Walmart handing out DVDs.
[00:38:01.788 --> 00:38:04.389]  They're now being charged with peddling and pandering.
[00:38:04.809 --> 00:38:06.350]  Well, they're not selling anything.
[00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:08.030]  This is free speech and they're really
[00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:15.875]  They're really trying to push that out of our lives and say, no, no, no, free speech is really a privilege and we're going to allow you to do that in a certain place.
[00:38:16.135 --> 00:38:18.137]  Here's a nice pen, here's your free speech zone.
[00:38:18.897 --> 00:38:25.742]  And I'd like to get your take on how we can change that, how we can make sure that our entire country is a free speech zone.
[00:38:27.123 --> 00:38:29.204]  Make sure the entire country is a free speech zone?
[00:38:29.224 --> 00:38:34.968]  Well, isn't that the multi-trillion dollar question and the all ten amendment question?
[00:38:35.088 --> 00:38:36.229]  We really have to
[00:38:37.853 --> 00:38:40.697]  You know, build up resistance on a pragmatic level.
[00:38:40.737 --> 00:38:55.315]  We have to take back the positions of office and the means to counteract all this improper legislation, as well as to have the support of your local police department.
[00:38:55.905 --> 00:38:56.606]  I don't know.
[00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:29.158]  If you had a trial by jury nowadays, it would be a lot easier to defeat these anti-free speech legislation, but it seems now that they've completely taken away the power of jury nullification by abolishing, in almost all cases, this right to a jury.
[00:39:30.178 --> 00:39:36.301]  Yeah, they put the power directly in the judge's hands so that they can ensure they get the payoff and that you have no chance of defending yourself.
[00:39:36.642 --> 00:39:37.822]  It's the new America with a K.
[00:39:39.941 --> 00:39:48.684]  It's just, it's sad to me, but, you know, releasing this new film, showing people that activists can make a difference, and, I mean, you, Nick, are a huge activist.
[00:39:48.944 --> 00:39:53.265]  Why don't you list off some of the bigwigs that you've actually confronted and gotten on film?
[00:39:53.545 --> 00:39:59.607]  My favorite, personally, of course, is the Bob Graham confrontation, and that's going to be in my new film, Fabled Enemy.
[00:39:59.647 --> 00:40:02.868]  So, why don't you go over some of the other people out there that you've been able to get?
[00:40:04.375 --> 00:40:07.716]  Well, we've gotten pretty much the whole slew of presidential candidates.
[00:40:07.756 --> 00:40:11.858]  Hillary, Barack, Giuliani, of course.
[00:40:11.878 --> 00:40:22.682]  When Giuliani tried to come into our city and act like a Philadelphian and get a Philly cheesesteak, it was so, I mean, hilarious for lack of a better term.
[00:40:23.022 --> 00:40:29.024]  He could not handle the level of resistance coming from the six, it was only like six of us out there, but we just, we pinned him in.
[00:40:29.768 --> 00:40:32.190]  And, uh, we had the, we won over the support of the crowd.
[00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:50.405]  I mean, most of his, uh, his, uh, most fervent supporters actually, you know, came onto our side because they understood that the first responders is a critical issue and that for somebody to be that derelict in their duties, uh, to not have, uh, taken care of, of, you know, city workers and all, you know, volunteer firefighters is just completely
[00:40:51.093 --> 00:41:01.663]  You know, unheard of, so... The absolute heroes of 9-11, by the way, the people that literally went into the fires, into the places where there was still molten metal, okay?
[00:41:02.024 --> 00:41:09.211]  People who sacrificed limbs, who have died of cancer, who are now walking around breathing out of a bag and they're less than 40, you know?
[00:41:09.451 --> 00:41:11.533]  The real heroes, yeah, he really spit on them, didn't he?
[00:41:12.786 --> 00:41:19.728]  I think the most important truth squads, to be honest, are those that are more in the line of investigative journalism.
[00:41:20.068 --> 00:41:36.172]  And really, Bob Graham was more along that line because the questions that we asked were more to do with his personal involvement with Randy Glass, the FBI ATF operative who was undercover prior to 9-11 and tried to expose the plot by R.G.
[00:41:36.212 --> 00:41:38.733]  Abbas and Osama bin Laden to destroy the World Trade Center.
[00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:44.425]  And of course, Bob Graham had full knowledge of this plot, and he never conveyed it through the proper channel.
[00:41:44.445 --> 00:41:48.250]  So when we confronted him on that, you know, face-to-face, and he denied it...
[00:41:48.686 --> 00:42:04.869]  I mean, it's just a sheer testament to the duplicity of these people, where they, you know, they say one thing on camera, you know, back in 2002, and then you catch them again at a more recent date, and they'll completely deny it, contrary to all the factual and videographer's evidence.
[00:42:04.969 --> 00:42:06.030]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:15.092]  But, um, beyond Beyonce, Bob Graham, I think the Willie Brown confrontation was pretty effective as well, because you saw how he could not control his temper.
[00:42:15.472 --> 00:42:17.092]  When he was pressed with, uh,
[00:42:17.677 --> 00:42:24.605]  You know, the more pointed questions about who warned him specifically and, you know, the nature of his activities on the morning of 9-11.
[00:42:24.705 --> 00:42:27.488]  He just couldn't stand up to the fire.
[00:42:27.528 --> 00:42:34.075]  I mean, we held his feet to the fire and he just, you know, he burned down to a crisp to the point where he could barely even keep his confidence.
[00:42:34.095 --> 00:42:34.936]  And let's go over that.
[00:42:34.976 --> 00:42:39.601]  You know, it was reported in the San Francisco Chronicle that he got a low-key warning not to fly that morning.
[00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:45.455]  Now when he was pressed on that, eventually he would say, Oh, I don't know anything about that.
[00:42:45.495 --> 00:42:46.776]  That was misinformation.
[00:42:47.176 --> 00:42:54.423]  Dylan actually went on his radio show and was going to ask him, but coincidentally, Willie Brown was out that day and he had a substitute host.
[00:42:54.463 --> 00:42:55.704]  So we never got to ask him there.
[00:42:56.065 --> 00:42:57.286]  And then you got to ask him.
[00:42:58.084 --> 00:43:00.726]  And he denies it even... I mean, you guys got to ask him.
[00:43:00.766 --> 00:43:01.486]  He denies it.
[00:43:01.526 --> 00:43:02.747]  He didn't deny it necessarily.
[00:43:02.787 --> 00:43:04.048]  He denied a specific warning.
[00:43:04.068 --> 00:43:10.893]  He said, the warning that you're referring to is a standard warning that comes up for Washington every morning.
[00:43:11.133 --> 00:43:11.833]  That's what he said.
[00:43:12.534 --> 00:43:22.981]  And we couldn't even, you know, really find a way to deal with that because within the article it says that he got a low-key early warning.
[00:43:23.041 --> 00:43:25.002]  And you have to understand the two reporters that
[00:43:26.656 --> 00:43:31.678]  You know, wrote the story of Maytier and Ross were actually embedded with the mayor on the day of 9-11.
[00:43:31.738 --> 00:43:35.640]  They were, you know, they were running around the city with him as he conducted his emergency operation.
[00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:43.143]  So for him to, you know, try to contradict verbatim what was told to these reporters is just completely absurd.
[00:43:43.423 --> 00:43:45.664]  And you can really see the anger in his face, by the way.
[00:43:45.704 --> 00:43:51.946]  I mean, folks, if you haven't seen this... And then when we... Well, first of all, he tried to really even deny the existence of the words in the article.
[00:43:52.226 --> 00:43:56.128]  And then Mark Peters, one of my compatriots, reads it all verbatim.
[00:43:56.468 --> 00:43:59.570]  And his face just drops into this incredulous expression.
[00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:06.473]  And, you know, toward the end of it, another one of our guys just puts... It's a book signing, so he just puts the article right on the desk.
[00:44:07.033 --> 00:44:10.835]  So, I mean, that really, you know, added insult to injury.
[00:44:10.995 --> 00:44:19.359]  And I'm sure Willie Brown can't... I think he did cancel quite a few of his book tours, because I was trying to encourage folks to go, you know, ask him more pressing questions.
[00:44:19.439 --> 00:44:24.561]  But it looks as if he never... He cut it short at about, like, one week after ours.
[00:44:25.422 --> 00:44:34.969]  And that's what's key, is that we keep the pressure on these guys, that we don't let them just go off and spew their propaganda without any resistance whatsoever.
[00:44:35.009 --> 00:44:37.411]  I mean, look what's happened to Oliver North recently.
[00:44:37.751 --> 00:44:40.233]  You know, look what's happened to Bill Clinton everywhere.
[00:44:40.253 --> 00:44:53.903]  You know, Bill Clinton, a couple days ago, he said that he's looking forward, at least he said this, it was a blurb on CNN, I guess McKenna, one of his staff, said that Bill Clinton was ready to campaign with and for
[00:44:54.543 --> 00:44:55.403]  Barack Obama.
[00:44:55.444 --> 00:44:56.824]  So he wants to go on tour with him.
[00:44:57.264 --> 00:44:58.925]  And that's what's important.
[00:44:59.105 --> 00:44:59.846]  See, people don't understand.
[00:44:59.866 --> 00:45:00.206]  Well, why?
[00:45:00.226 --> 00:45:02.087]  This guy's not even the president anymore.
[00:45:02.187 --> 00:45:04.528]  No, but he's still heavily involved in politics.
[00:45:04.828 --> 00:45:07.689]  He has a huge influential base.
[00:45:08.109 --> 00:45:12.852]  And his wife is involved in politics and still may be the nominee as vice president.
[00:45:13.072 --> 00:45:17.734]  So it is very important that we don't stop our efforts, but we double our efforts.
[00:45:18.114 --> 00:45:21.916]  And hopefully, you know, 9-11 Chronicles Part 2 is going to be truth revolution.
[00:45:22.396 --> 00:45:22.976]  You know what I mean?
[00:45:23.056 --> 00:45:25.558]  Or, you know, finally we get our Constitution back.
[00:45:25.658 --> 00:45:27.138]  I don't know what Part 2 is going to be.
[00:45:27.399 --> 00:45:28.959]  It's up to us to make the Part 2.
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:30.020]  You know what I'm saying?
[00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:32.121]  It's up to us to bring these guys to justice.
[00:45:32.341 --> 00:45:40.145]  It's up to us to support people like Dennis Kucinich, who have the balls to bring 35 articles of impeachment to this obvious criminal administration.
[00:45:41.727 --> 00:45:41.947]  Right.
[00:45:42.207 --> 00:45:47.228]  And Jason, did you by chance get an opportunity to review that article I submitted to you yesterday?
[00:45:47.248 --> 00:45:48.848]  You know, I wasn't able to, man.
[00:45:48.948 --> 00:45:53.389]  I was in the office until about 1 o'clock in the morning and we were having server issues.
[00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:56.450]  You can only imagine what this office is like, but I didn't get to.
[00:45:56.490 --> 00:45:57.630]  I had to get some sleep before this.
[00:45:57.850 --> 00:46:00.511]  But why don't you go over what's going on out there.
[00:46:00.531 --> 00:46:01.851]  I know you sent that article.
[00:46:02.031 --> 00:46:02.611]  Yeah, go ahead.
[00:46:02.711 --> 00:46:05.972]  Alright, well, it's really apropos for today, of course, because we have
[00:46:06.997 --> 00:46:16.103]  You know, a celebration of the birth of this nation, and then the eventual institution of the Constitution, you know, in 1787 or 1789.
[00:46:16.884 --> 00:46:33.415]  And really, what we have, it happened to one of our members, and the issue was he had political signs on his personal property, his home in Belmar, New Jersey, and a local municipal order states that you cannot have any signs whatsoever on your local
[00:46:34.073 --> 00:46:35.014]  Uh, on your property.
[00:46:35.354 --> 00:46:40.998]  And, uh, it's totally bizarre, you would think, because how are people supposed to run for office?
[00:46:41.018 --> 00:46:49.404]  Like, literally, in this township, you cannot have a Hillary, Barack, or even, like, a local candidate's, uh, advertisement on your property for political candidacy.
[00:46:49.924 --> 00:46:53.707]  So, I mean, anyway, and my friend had no idea.
[00:46:53.727 --> 00:46:57.189]  I mean, he just, he erected a Ron Paul sign, it was.
[00:46:57.589 --> 00:47:01.552]  But anyhow, the municipal worker, the township zoning official,
[00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:05.753]  You know, he actually has no trespassing signs posted on his property.
[00:47:06.113 --> 00:47:15.539]  So this fellow, Mr. Warburton, comes onto his property, starts peering into his windows, and then, eventually, when my friend comes to the door, he serves him with a note.
[00:47:15.579 --> 00:47:20.062]  He basically, I think, verbally says to him, if you don't remove the sign, you're going to be cited.
[00:47:20.082 --> 00:47:27.267]  His friend doesn't remove the sign, and actually, I think, a week later, he receives a citation in the mail.
[00:47:29.309 --> 00:47:30.390]  It's an undescribed amount.
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:34.120]  Basically, from there, he erects two more signs.
[00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:36.341]  I mean, it's four by eight Ron Paul signs.
[00:47:36.361 --> 00:47:36.921]  They're major.
[00:47:37.241 --> 00:47:41.402]  So we're talking a four by 24 complex.
[00:47:42.062 --> 00:47:45.102]  And from there, they issue citations.
[00:47:45.122 --> 00:47:46.943]  And eventually, he summons the court.
[00:47:47.583 --> 00:47:52.384]  And when he gets the court, this is where it really gets heated up.
[00:47:53.784 --> 00:47:58.345]  He tries to determine... Well, first of all, he has all the constitutional laws about free speech.
[00:47:58.765 --> 00:48:00.545]  He has Supreme Court rulings.
[00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:01.591]  All right.
[00:48:18.783 --> 00:48:22.744]  It has to be dismissed or it has to be transferred to federal court.
[00:48:23.165 --> 00:48:31.088]  Now when he brought this up to the judge during the arraignment, the judge tried to repeatedly stonewall him, wouldn't allow him to get it on the record.
[00:48:31.128 --> 00:48:32.268]  He finally did so.
[00:48:33.188 --> 00:48:40.511]  And while at the same time, there's also another issue wherein he's questioning the jurisdiction of the court in the first place because
[00:48:41.076 --> 00:48:42.897]  Actually, the gentleman just arrived right now.
[00:48:42.917 --> 00:48:44.777]  His name is Fabrizio Matracia.
[00:48:45.338 --> 00:48:53.761]  And he's questioning the jurisdiction of the court because you'll find that, like we were stating earlier, is that courts no longer have trial by jury.
[00:48:53.821 --> 00:48:54.461]  Why is that?
[00:48:54.781 --> 00:48:57.302]  It's because they're operating under a pseudo-jurisdiction.
[00:48:57.983 --> 00:49:02.124]  And really what happens in Matracia's case is that he starts to question the jurisdiction.
[00:49:02.464 --> 00:49:06.626]  And he finds that, well, he poses the question as follows.
[00:49:07.086 --> 00:49:09.587]  Is this going to be a jurisdiction under
[00:49:10.393 --> 00:49:11.134]  The common law?
[00:49:11.274 --> 00:49:14.739]  Or is it going to be a jurisdiction under admiralty or military tribunal?
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:19.286]  And the judge says that it's not under admiralty and it repeats it very sternly.
[00:49:19.707 --> 00:49:25.435]  So then it comes down to, well therefore, it must be under the common law, a criminal prosecution under the common law.
[00:49:26.107 --> 00:49:28.831]  And, uh, the judge will not answer that, that inquiry.
[00:49:28.891 --> 00:49:30.113]  He refuses to do so.
[00:49:30.133 --> 00:49:34.379]  Well, because that, that automatically takes the power right out of his hands and it gives it to the state.
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:37.123]  And, uh... He says, shut up, you're done.
[00:49:37.404 --> 00:49:38.044]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:49:38.185 --> 00:49:40.989]  Where can people find out information and support this guy?
[00:49:41.109 --> 00:49:42.411]  Is there a website or what's going on?
[00:49:43.452 --> 00:49:44.533]  I sent out the press release.
[00:49:44.653 --> 00:49:46.654]  You know, it's going to be on NWO Blogger.
[00:49:46.694 --> 00:49:50.316]  Unfortunately, I was having internet issues myself last night, so I couldn't make it up there.
[00:49:50.336 --> 00:49:53.618]  But NWOBlogger.com, we'll have the story by this afternoon.
[00:49:54.419 --> 00:49:57.360]  And the gentleman is here right now, but here's another thing.
[00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:58.681]  I just want to get this on the air.
[00:49:59.061 --> 00:50:07.266]  Is that after the trial, I mean, he was basically adjourned for the day, and then it was going to go into a trial a month later or so.
[00:50:08.244 --> 00:50:12.988]  In the interim, he decided to go and try to find the judge's oath of office.
[00:50:13.168 --> 00:50:14.469]  And this is the real scary part.
[00:50:14.830 --> 00:50:25.418]  He did obtain a copy of the judge's oath of office, but what he discovered was that the judge did not swear an oath to defend and uphold the Constitution of the United States, nor of the state of New Jersey.
[00:50:26.199 --> 00:50:31.263]  And that's in direct violation of, I believe it's sixth offense, I mean article six of the Constitution.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:32.520]  Absolutely.
[00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:38.703]  Nick, we're going to come back one more final segment with Philly 9-11 Truth doing street actions right across the street from Independence Hall.
[00:50:38.743 --> 00:50:42.745]  It's the Alex Jones Show, PrisonPlanet.tv, 9-11 Chronicles, Truth Rising.
[00:50:53.870 --> 00:51:00.854]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero and we knew what to do.
[00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:03.151]  At least we thought we did.
[00:51:03.211 --> 00:51:06.073]  Whitman, EPA Director on the 18th made a statement that the air
[00:51:17.369 --> 00:51:18.490]  We're shaped to breathe.
[00:51:18.851 --> 00:51:25.658]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:51:25.958 --> 00:51:29.001]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:51:29.121 --> 00:51:34.246]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:51:34.887 --> 00:51:37.507]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:51:37.968 --> 00:51:43.809]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[00:51:44.009 --> 00:51:46.549]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:51:46.929 --> 00:51:51.950]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:51:54.971 --> 00:51:57.791]  Another untold story, here it comes.
[00:51:59.551 --> 00:52:02.252]  Another untold story, here it comes.
[00:52:04.068 --> 00:52:11.397]  Another untold story that you've not been told from another untold story dot com.
[00:52:13.868 --> 00:52:14.648]  How could it be?
[00:52:15.269 --> 00:52:18.351]  It can't be, some say, but they can't deny it.
[00:52:19.071 --> 00:52:24.094]  All the scientific foreknowledge in the most ancient, accurate, truthful storybook ever written.
[00:52:24.735 --> 00:52:36.121]  For example, a scientist by the name of Spencer, who lived back in the 1800s, made a then-world discovery that there is only five known manifestations of the unknowable in existence.
[00:52:36.222 --> 00:52:36.762]  Only five.
[00:52:37.162 --> 00:52:43.807]  Yet, in the very first line penned 3,400 years ago in that book, all five were made known.
[00:52:44.447 --> 00:52:48.350]  Ever heard of Mathieu Fontaine Marais, the founder of the science of oceanography?
[00:52:48.990 --> 00:52:53.834]  He found that there were actual paths in the sea, found them, chartered them, ships sail them today.
[00:52:53.914 --> 00:52:56.356]  But guess where he found them first?
[00:52:57.296 --> 00:53:01.220]  And guess what astronomers found after the invention of the telescope?
[00:53:01.681 --> 00:53:04.604]  Found it in the north, a great empty space.
[00:53:05.064 --> 00:53:07.307]  But what did the book say about that?
[00:53:07.987 --> 00:53:12.792]  Then with that invention called the telescope, they found that the stars cannot be numbered.
[00:53:13.453 --> 00:53:16.455]  But in 150 B.C., the scientists were numbering them.
[00:53:16.976 --> 00:53:17.716]  Today, they don't.
[00:53:17.956 --> 00:53:19.077]  They say they can't be.
[00:53:19.617 --> 00:53:20.318]  Can't be numbered.
[00:53:20.498 --> 00:53:23.260]  But guess what the book said, thousands of years ago?
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:29.744]  It's called Scientific Foreknowledge, and those that don't want you to believe that book say, can't be, no way.
[00:53:29.804 --> 00:53:32.947]  Don't listen to AnotherUntoldStory.com.
[00:53:34.408 --> 00:53:39.091]  For another untold story, go to AnotherUntoldStory.com.
[00:53:39.351 --> 00:53:41.553]  AnotherUntoldStory.com.
[00:53:43.197 --> 00:53:45.782]  Another Untold Story dot com.
[00:53:47.324 --> 00:53:50.370]  Another Untold Story dot com.
[00:54:15.253 --> 00:54:16.454]  People shuffling their feet.
[00:54:16.614 --> 00:54:20.537]  People sleeping in their shoes.
[00:54:20.577 --> 00:54:25.901]  There's a warning sign on the road ahead.
[00:54:26.201 --> 00:54:29.684]  There's a lot of people saying we'd be better off dead.
[00:54:30.384 --> 00:54:33.207]  Don't feel like Satan, but I am your man.
[00:54:33.567 --> 00:54:38.691]  So I try to forget in any way I can.
[00:54:38.751 --> 00:54:41.433]  Keep on rocking in the free world.
[00:54:45.706 --> 00:54:48.228]  Keep on rockin' in the free world!
[00:54:48.328 --> 00:54:52.371]  I'm gonna keep on rockin' till it's free again.
[00:54:52.391 --> 00:54:56.895]  Cuz our country is far from the free world anymore, folks.
[00:54:57.815 --> 00:55:01.198]  With things like free speech zones that are total oxymorons.
[00:55:01.899 --> 00:55:04.981]  With an assault on the Constitution and Bill of Rights like no other.
[00:55:05.181 --> 00:55:06.742]  With private detention centers.
[00:55:08.684 --> 00:55:09.865]  With torture facilities.
[00:55:10.828 --> 00:55:14.330]  We've got a long way to go in this country if we want a free world again.
[00:55:14.350 --> 00:55:16.792]  If we want to do it, it's up to us.
[00:55:16.872 --> 00:55:21.655]  It's not sitting on our couch slurping down Jenny Light and watching sports.
[00:55:21.675 --> 00:55:23.176]  Although a lot of you are going to be doing that today.
[00:55:23.216 --> 00:55:24.236]  It is the 4th of July.
[00:55:24.256 --> 00:55:25.037]  I understand that.
[00:55:25.277 --> 00:55:34.702]  But there are some of us out there that have dedicated a portion of Independence Day to reclaiming that independence that we so desire.
[00:55:34.923 --> 00:55:39.025]  Many people still think they have, but unfortunately they really just don't.
[00:55:39.085 --> 00:55:40.526]  And I'm with Nick Kerangi.
[00:55:41.741 --> 00:55:42.962]  Of Philly 9-11 Truth.
[00:55:44.924 --> 00:55:46.065]  Where do we go from here?
[00:55:46.165 --> 00:55:46.665]  What's next?
[00:55:46.745 --> 00:55:49.468]  I know that I'm going to be down at Ground Zero on 9-11, Nick.
[00:55:49.948 --> 00:55:51.329]  And, you know, there'll be a bunch of us.
[00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:52.910]  We're going to be handing out DVDs.
[00:55:53.051 --> 00:55:54.292]  We've done this yearly.
[00:55:54.912 --> 00:55:58.015]  People have talked about the Ron Paul march out in D.C.
[00:55:58.035 --> 00:55:58.895]  this summer as well.
[00:55:59.516 --> 00:56:00.737]  But what can we do as a movement?
[00:56:00.757 --> 00:56:03.519]  I think one of the biggest things is probably to spread films.
[00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:05.161]  You know, like mine, like others.
[00:56:05.241 --> 00:56:06.942]  Especially this new one, Truth Rising.
[00:56:07.323 --> 00:56:09.024]  It's really an activist toolkit.
[00:56:09.304 --> 00:56:09.945]  You know, a how-to.
[00:56:11.212 --> 00:56:11.873]  But what do you think?
[00:56:12.333 --> 00:56:13.434]  What's next for this movement?
[00:56:15.295 --> 00:56:22.501]  I mean, the real next steps for this movement, and I made these remarks down at Bilderberg, I believe is that we need to get more organized.
[00:56:22.581 --> 00:56:26.143]  And it's not, perhaps, how some are postulating.
[00:56:26.263 --> 00:56:30.527]  We don't need to be centrally organized, but we certainly do need hubs, activist hubs.
[00:56:31.311 --> 00:56:39.914]  Communication networks, and I think that sites like InfoWarsSocial and RestoreTheRepublic.com are very good, you know, initiating steps toward that goal.
[00:56:40.534 --> 00:56:54.258]  And what can be done really from there is, you know, what we saw with the Ron Paul movement was sort of a degree of that was we did see local groups consolidate, but unfortunately ever since, you know, our president's campaign died out,
[00:56:55.555 --> 00:57:00.141]  It's really dissipated those local groups, so we still have those contacts.
[00:57:00.361 --> 00:57:05.287]  In essence, it's just that they're kind of inert at this stage in time.
[00:57:05.628 --> 00:57:09.633]  So what we have to do is take those people, get them onto an information network,
[00:57:10.066 --> 00:57:12.707]  Where they can essentially organize locally more easily.
[00:57:13.007 --> 00:57:17.408]  And at the same time, there can be, you know, there can be updates posted on a national level.
[00:57:18.048 --> 00:57:24.250]  That's really where we're heading with this, is that there is a national movement at this point in time, but it's really autonomous working groups.
[00:57:24.290 --> 00:57:29.031]  But we are change chapters, although they do have a level of communication with one another.
[00:57:29.051 --> 00:57:31.572]  And same with the 9-11 truth chapters and the Ron Paul groups.
[00:57:31.872 --> 00:57:36.493]  They're still largely disconnected, and that connection is vital to our success.
[00:57:36.693 --> 00:57:39.979]  Well I'm really hoping that CampaignForLiberty.org, Ron Paul's new...
[00:57:40.931 --> 00:57:50.637]  ...organization that's supposedly going to be putting people like us into office can really attract those that maybe are a bit disappointed that their president is no longer in the race.
[00:57:51.077 --> 00:57:53.779]  But they have to realize they're the ones that have to step up.
[00:57:53.859 --> 00:57:54.279]  Step up!
[00:57:54.359 --> 00:57:55.279]  Be a city councilman.
[00:57:55.379 --> 00:57:56.260]  Be a state senator.
[00:57:56.460 --> 00:57:59.122]  If your congressional district is open, go for it.
[00:57:59.422 --> 00:57:59.682]  You know?
[00:58:00.022 --> 00:58:01.663]  No one else is going to do it for you.
[00:58:02.023 --> 00:58:04.125]  And that's why I really like that organization.
[00:58:04.145 --> 00:58:05.625]  They took that money, they put it there.
[00:58:05.645 --> 00:58:08.247]  Why don't you throw out your website one more time before you go, Nick?
[00:58:08.897 --> 00:58:12.398]  Alright, yeah, if you want to visit nwoblogger.com.
[00:58:12.418 --> 00:58:14.458]  That's nwoblogger.com.
[00:58:14.918 --> 00:58:19.299]  And just so we're clear, the legal battle goes on with Mr. Matracia.
[00:58:19.899 --> 00:58:21.519]  He has defeated that one case.
[00:58:21.799 --> 00:58:22.760]  Alright, man, I gotta go.
[00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:24.620]  Alex Jones Show, thanks for joining us.
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:25.620]  We'll be back after this.

[00:59:48.419 --> 00:59:51.221]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:58.050 --> 00:59:59.151]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:59.811 --> 01:00:00.631]  You want answers?
[01:00:01.391 --> 01:00:02.312]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:06.653]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:07.134 --> 01:00:11.175]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:12.616 --> 01:00:14.516]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome!
[01:00:14.716 --> 01:00:18.558]  It is the fourth day of July, Independence Day 2008.
[01:00:19.638 --> 01:00:21.539]  I am not Alex Jones, I am Jason Burmess.
[01:00:22.179 --> 01:00:26.461]  Guest hosting this fabulous, fireworks-filled day.
[01:00:27.205 --> 01:00:28.545]  Fun fireworks filled day.
[01:00:28.885 --> 01:00:30.346]  I'm hoping to see some fireworks today.
[01:00:30.586 --> 01:00:31.886]  Let's see what Austin has to offer.
[01:00:31.926 --> 01:00:33.106]  I'm sure it's going to be a good time.
[01:00:34.466 --> 01:00:39.707]  Truth Rising has dropped, and I want to read yet another review because they're really pouring in, folks.
[01:00:40.747 --> 01:00:45.308]  And then we're going to get Bob Chapman on the line, and we're going to have him on from TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[01:00:46.748 --> 01:00:47.208]  Woo woo!
[01:00:47.548 --> 01:00:48.489]  Just finished watching it.
[01:00:48.589 --> 01:00:49.209]  Very neat.
[01:00:49.389 --> 01:00:50.589]  Best movie so far.
[01:00:50.709 --> 01:00:53.949]  Energizing, fun attitude that makes it watchable for ignorant folks.
[01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:57.010]  Luke became a historical figure at this point.
[01:00:57.785 --> 01:01:00.026]  By the way, who is that girl who confronted Giuliani?
[01:01:00.946 --> 01:01:03.548]  If you talk about courage, that was the perfect example.
[01:01:03.908 --> 01:01:04.328]  Amazing.
[01:01:04.448 --> 01:01:05.408]  That's Sabrina, by the way.
[01:01:07.069 --> 01:01:10.211]  Yeah, I will continue to talk about 9-11 too, as long as I live.
[01:01:10.531 --> 01:01:11.711]  We'll bring them to justice.
[01:01:12.592 --> 01:01:13.632]  There are many ways to do it.
[01:01:13.692 --> 01:01:15.853]  Eventually, the real perpetrators will fail.
[01:01:16.973 --> 01:01:24.757]  Also, if they have all the power behind them, all the grunt military force, all the money, all arrogant fake news puppets, they are not real.
[01:01:25.569 --> 01:01:27.912]  They are little pitiful demons without souls.
[01:01:29.593 --> 01:01:33.538]  They just can't do anything about the real truth movement.
[01:01:33.618 --> 01:01:37.922]  People are so powerful and energizing when they know they fight for the right side.
[01:01:38.923 --> 01:01:43.749]  No power, how great so ever, can do anything to fight that.
[01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:47.653]  Truth and power and independent thought will eventually pour into the minds of everyone.
[01:01:48.490 --> 01:01:51.952]  We shouldn't feel as victims, but as powerful fighters for the truth force.
[01:01:52.312 --> 01:01:53.713]  The good spirit of the human race.
[01:01:54.034 --> 01:01:58.616]  Truth and power to the people, misery and pain to the corrupted souls of the New World Order.
[01:01:59.597 --> 01:02:00.197]  Awesome review!
[01:02:01.098 --> 01:02:01.778]  Awesome review!
[01:02:02.819 --> 01:02:04.560]  And, uh, like I said, you can get this at high quality.
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:06.661]  I mean, almost DVD quality.
[01:02:06.681 --> 01:02:11.284]  And, folks, I encoded these myself to make sure that they were good stuff.
[01:02:11.845 --> 01:02:14.186]  Uh, you know, the 699 megabyte one, or the... I think it's 680, actually.
[01:02:14.206 --> 01:02:14.666]  Uh, it's okay.
[01:02:17.629 --> 01:02:20.010]  It's the lowest of the DivX, but still looks amazing.
[01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:25.391]  But the other two... Wow, there's not much difference between the 830 megabyte and the gig file.
[01:02:25.871 --> 01:02:37.254]  And like I said, you burn that right to disk, throw it on your DivX DVD player, you're literally watching it on your new plasma screen television, with your friends and family, while you're downing nachos and watching the football game.
[01:02:38.435 --> 01:02:40.975]  Actually, there's no football right now, so you're probably watching baseball.
[01:02:41.115 --> 01:02:43.236]  I'd be watching baseball too, it's a sunny day, it's nice.
[01:02:46.508 --> 01:03:15.949]  Luke Rudowski gonna be on later and you know when you see somebody like Luke come as far as he has it's just so so encouraging again this is somebody who was part of New York 9-11 Truth wanted to do even more he said you know what these these meetings aren't as effective as I'd like them to be and the same people we're not reaching as many as many as I'd like so he made connections he got big signs he got a dedicated core
[01:03:17.193 --> 01:03:21.396]  And he went down to Ground Zero every single weekend.
[01:03:22.036 --> 01:03:24.218]  Okay?
[01:03:24.258 --> 01:03:34.844]  Then in 2006, after we went down and we handed out 10,000 DVDs of Loose Change, we had 2,000 people in Investigate 9-11 shirts.
[01:03:35.285 --> 01:03:36.005]  Luke said, you know what?
[01:03:36.045 --> 01:03:37.566]  It's time to start my own organization.
[01:03:38.927 --> 01:03:41.929]  Let us be the change that we want to see in the world.
[01:03:43.650 --> 01:03:44.951]  And over the last two years,
[01:03:46.212 --> 01:03:53.275]  Luke Rudowsky has done incredible and amazing things, and they are chronicled in this new film, Truth Rising.
[01:03:54.996 --> 01:03:57.017]  Again, it just shows the power of one person.
[01:03:57.317 --> 01:04:10.984]  There's no one out there listening right now that can't do something, that can't put forward their talent, that can't take the time to get a video camera, to go to an event, to ask a tough question, to hold these criminals' feet to the flames.
[01:04:12.947 --> 01:04:13.968]  That's what needs to be done.
[01:04:14.308 --> 01:04:17.510]  We need to keep pressing and pressing and pressing, and that's why we just had Nick Kerangi on.
[01:04:17.710 --> 01:04:22.993]  Because you could hear in the background at times, the crowds, and a free speech zone doesn't stop him.
[01:04:23.893 --> 01:04:29.696]  He's still, right across from Independence Hall in Philadelphia, speaking the truth, talking 9-11.
[01:04:31.137 --> 01:04:31.917]  And we gotta do that.
[01:04:31.937 --> 01:04:33.598]  They're bringing it up again, folks.
[01:04:33.899 --> 01:04:35.419]  Bush says he wants to capture Bin Laden.
[01:04:35.439 --> 01:04:36.580]  This story's not going away.
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:39.382]  It's the Alex Jones Show, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:04:50.819 --> 01:04:53.761]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:04:53.921 --> 01:04:59.144]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:04:59.444 --> 01:05:04.787]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:05:05.148 --> 01:05:06.288]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:06.629 --> 01:05:15.614]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:05:15.954 --> 01:05:17.576]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[01:05:17.796 --> 01:05:21.961]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[01:05:50.535 --> 01:05:52.596]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[01:05:52.696 --> 01:05:55.097]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:05:55.117 --> 01:05:57.358]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:05:57.378 --> 01:05:58.939]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:05:58.959 --> 01:06:00.560]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:03.501]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:06:03.541 --> 01:06:09.184]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:06:09.264 --> 01:06:16.407]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[01:06:16.827 --> 01:06:22.095]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:06:22.957 --> 01:06:24.078]  An inside job!
[01:06:25.504 --> 01:06:26.624]  How dare you!
[01:06:26.964 --> 01:06:32.986]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:06:33.006 --> 01:06:35.807]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:06:35.887 --> 01:06:42.068]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[01:06:42.368 --> 01:06:44.909]  Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now.
[01:06:45.209 --> 01:06:47.189]  Or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[01:06:47.449 --> 01:06:49.930]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:06:50.868 --> 01:06:57.310]  I am at a gathering of friends, minding my own business, when one of our buddies, Bob, walks up to me, very concerned, and he says, Wow!
[01:06:57.551 --> 01:06:59.291]  Have you seen the gasoline prices lately?
[01:06:59.311 --> 01:07:00.091]  And I said, Oh, of course.
[01:07:00.532 --> 01:07:00.872]  Woo!
[01:07:00.912 --> 01:07:01.372]  They're high.
[01:07:01.772 --> 01:07:02.252]  He says, Yeah.
[01:07:02.272 --> 01:07:03.073]  He says, What am I going to do?
[01:07:03.373 --> 01:07:03.913]  I've got a truck.
[01:07:03.933 --> 01:07:06.534]  There's no way anybody's going to buy my truck in this market.
[01:07:06.854 --> 01:07:08.455]  I really need the truck for my job.
[01:07:08.775 --> 01:07:10.455]  It uses more gas than I can afford.
[01:07:10.775 --> 01:07:12.736]  I've got to find a way to come up with some extra money.
[01:07:13.016 --> 01:07:14.397]  I've got a wife with four kids at home.
[01:07:14.677 --> 01:07:15.457]  I don't know what to do.
[01:07:15.797 --> 01:07:16.718]  I said, Bob, relax.
[01:07:16.838 --> 01:07:17.518]  I know what to do.
[01:07:18.098 --> 01:07:22.201]  Call eFoodsDirect.com or go up on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:07:22.401 --> 01:07:32.570]  They will deliver food, really good, high-quality, nutritional, delicious food to your door, your door now, right there in front of your house, for about half the price that you were paying for groceries last year.
[01:07:32.930 --> 01:07:40.516]  You can take the savings from that, offset the cost of your fuel, and use it to buy more inexpensive food to hedge against tomorrow's increasing food prices.
[01:07:40.776 --> 01:07:41.736]  Why don't you do that, Bob?
[01:07:41.957 --> 01:07:43.497]  He said, eFoodsDirect.com?
[01:07:43.557 --> 01:07:43.977]  I said, yep.
[01:07:44.037 --> 01:07:46.679]  Call them at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:07:46.699 --> 01:07:47.219]  That's 800-409-5633.
[01:07:47.439 --> 01:07:49.760]  Do it now.
[01:07:51.701 --> 01:07:57.724]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:58.324 --> 01:08:01.365]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:04.587 --> 01:08:05.267]  All right, folks.
[01:08:05.767 --> 01:08:06.508]  We are back.
[01:08:07.488 --> 01:08:09.109]  I guess we have Chapman on in the next hour.
[01:08:10.333 --> 01:08:18.779]  So, I'm going to read this BBC thing, just to explain again to those that don't get it, that a big hit piece is coming, and then we're going to take your calls.
[01:08:18.799 --> 01:08:21.301]  We're going to go to Leo, Steve, Mario, Mark, and more.
[01:08:23.403 --> 01:08:25.284]  The evolution of a conspiracy theory.
[01:08:25.324 --> 01:08:28.366]  A large number of Americans questioned what happened that day.
[01:08:28.606 --> 01:08:31.268]  It wasn't part of the Twin Towers collapse on September 11th.
[01:08:31.288 --> 01:08:34.791]  The third World Trade Center tower that wasn't hit by planes also fell.
[01:08:35.879 --> 01:08:45.002]  As a report into the Tower 7 prepares to publish its finding, Mike Rudin, total scum, considers how the conspiracy theory got to be so big.
[01:08:45.342 --> 01:08:46.363]  Well, because it happened!
[01:08:46.383 --> 01:08:47.943]  Because they blew the building up, Mike!
[01:08:48.544 --> 01:08:48.884]  Okay?
[01:08:49.364 --> 01:08:51.224]  And he's got some snaggle teeth, too.
[01:08:51.665 --> 01:08:53.785]  I didn't want to bring that up, but it was pretty disgusting.
[01:08:53.805 --> 01:08:57.006]  He was a little taller than me, so my eyeline was, like, right in his gross mouth.
[01:08:57.507 --> 01:08:58.347]  He was very...
[01:08:59.019 --> 01:08:59.860]  Very pompous.
[01:09:00.421 --> 01:09:08.869]  Oh, I've been to Iraq, Jason, and hmm, he was very leftist too, like he was trying to be my friend, but really just a total weasel and a snake.
[01:09:08.889 --> 01:09:11.272]  9-11 is a conspiracy theory of the internet age.
[01:09:11.812 --> 01:09:15.116]  Put 9-11 conspiracy into Google and you get 7.9 million hits.
[01:09:15.476 --> 01:09:17.898]  Put in 9-11 truth and you get more than 22 million.
[01:09:19.039 --> 01:09:20.101]  Opinion polls in the U.S.
[01:09:20.121 --> 01:09:22.403]  have picked up widespread doubts among the American people.
[01:09:23.064 --> 01:09:30.350]  A New York Times CBS News poll in 2006 found that 53% of those that questioned thought the Bush administration was hiding something.
[01:09:30.610 --> 01:09:37.656]  Another US poll found a third of those questioned thought the government officials either assisted in the 9-11 attacks or allowed them to happen.
[01:09:37.897 --> 01:09:38.697]  Absolutely proven.
[01:09:40.299 --> 01:09:51.528]  In the UK, a survey by the BBC's Conspiracy Files carried out in something in 2006 found that 16% of those questioned thought there was a wider conspiracy that included the American government.
[01:09:51.808 --> 01:09:52.349]  Of course there was.
[01:09:53.201 --> 01:09:54.662]  Uh, for a very good, uh, reason.
[01:09:54.723 --> 01:09:57.485]  A lot of people are very suspicious about what went down that day.
[01:09:57.845 --> 01:09:59.547]  Dylan Avery, Director of Loose Change.
[01:10:00.087 --> 01:10:01.809]  Uh, the BBC and the missing tape.
[01:10:02.729 --> 01:10:06.833]  This summer will be a key moment for those who question the official explanation of what happened on 9-11.
[01:10:06.933 --> 01:10:07.433]  No, it won't!
[01:10:07.654 --> 01:10:07.974]  Okay?
[01:10:08.134 --> 01:10:12.037]  This summer won't be a key moment for- It'll be a key moment for the liars!
[01:10:12.638 --> 01:10:13.899]  Like yourself, Mike Rudin.
[01:10:14.219 --> 01:10:18.243]  Where you can pat yourself on the back, with your little Cointelpro op, and say,
[01:10:20.071 --> 01:10:21.112]  We explained it.
[01:10:21.412 --> 01:10:23.033]  It was fire all along.
[01:10:23.434 --> 01:10:24.795]  They're crazy.
[01:10:24.815 --> 01:10:28.538]  Oh, we're the BBC.
[01:10:28.658 --> 01:10:30.500]  We're the number one stunner.
[01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:31.580]  Believe us.
[01:10:31.801 --> 01:10:32.621]  That's what's going to happen.
[01:10:32.942 --> 01:10:35.904]  And so this Sandar guy is going to put out his NIST report.
[01:10:35.924 --> 01:10:36.705]  It's going to be bull.
[01:10:38.306 --> 01:10:38.666]  Oh, man.
[01:10:38.726 --> 01:10:39.567]  He's so mad.
[01:10:41.770 --> 01:10:45.211]  Nearly seven years after the terrible events of September that day, the U.S.
[01:10:45.231 --> 01:10:49.312]  authorities are due to publish the final report on the third tower that also collapsed on 9-11.
[01:10:49.792 --> 01:10:54.633]  Unlike the Twin Towers, this 47-story, 610-foot skyscraper was not hit by a plane.
[01:10:55.273 --> 01:11:02.214]  And Tower 7 has become a key issue for truthers like Dylan Avery, the director of the internet film on 9-11 called Loose Change.
[01:11:03.454 --> 01:11:06.575]  The truth movement is heavily centered on Building 7, and for very good reason.
[01:11:06.615 --> 01:11:10.096]  A lot of people are very suspicious about what went down that day, he says.
[01:11:10.556 --> 01:11:11.476]  Again, as they should be.
[01:11:12.725 --> 01:11:14.486]  See World Trade Center 7's location.
[01:11:14.506 --> 01:11:17.147]  Avery points out that Tower 7 housed some unusual tenants.
[01:11:17.207 --> 01:11:17.427]  It did.
[01:11:17.467 --> 01:11:25.850]  The CIA, the Secret Service, the Pentagon, and the very agency meant to deal with the disasters or terrorist attacks in New York, the Office of Emergency Management.
[01:11:26.251 --> 01:11:30.252]  And some people think Tower 7 was the place where 9-11 conspiracy was hatched.
[01:11:30.492 --> 01:11:31.333]  No one said that.
[01:11:31.593 --> 01:11:32.013]  Hold on.
[01:11:32.493 --> 01:11:32.673]  No.
[01:11:32.953 --> 01:11:37.275]  Who said that Building 7 was where the 9-11 conspiracy was hatched?
[01:11:38.490 --> 01:11:39.190]  Total bull.
[01:11:39.490 --> 01:11:40.351]  Total lies.
[01:11:41.491 --> 01:11:47.533]  See, again, all you people out there that think that the BBC's your friend, they're not your friend.
[01:11:47.713 --> 01:11:50.574]  They just pointed something out that no one said.
[01:11:50.774 --> 01:11:53.154]  If someone had said that, it would be a quote.
[01:11:54.395 --> 01:11:54.715]  Okay?
[01:11:55.155 --> 01:11:59.316]  It would say, this man said that that's where the 9-11 conspiracy was hatched.
[01:11:59.356 --> 01:11:59.616]  Building 7.
[01:11:59.796 --> 01:12:00.576]  No one said that.
[01:12:01.137 --> 01:12:02.257]  That's so ridiculous.
[01:12:06.665 --> 01:12:08.086]  Alright, I'm done.
[01:12:08.106 --> 01:12:08.367]  You know what?
[01:12:08.567 --> 01:12:21.056]  I'm done reading it because if you really do believe that Dr. Shyam Sunder is going to tell you the truth, that this NIST report is right, you know, it's not, okay?
[01:12:21.376 --> 01:12:23.137]  It's just going to be total bull.
[01:12:23.198 --> 01:12:24.178]  Alright, let's take calls.
[01:12:24.619 --> 01:12:26.400]  Leo in Mass, how you doing, man?
[01:12:28.481 --> 01:12:29.983]  Hi, great to catch up with you.
[01:12:31.544 --> 01:12:32.885]  I'll give you my critique on the
[01:12:34.211 --> 01:12:55.297]  9-11 rising afterwards, but I was thinking it would be kind of neat, you know, since Alex and you guys are such a prolific bunch of filmmakers, that we should, you know, those of us who are willing to contribute a fair amount of extra money, should be able to get the Alex Jones version of the Oscar.
[01:12:55.317 --> 01:12:58.778]  I could have a little Alex to put on my mantelpiece.
[01:12:58.838 --> 01:13:00.459]  No, I'm dead serious about this.
[01:13:01.277 --> 01:13:03.838]  We've got to permeate the culture in all aspects.
[01:13:04.158 --> 01:13:04.358]  Uh-huh.
[01:13:04.838 --> 01:13:06.158]  So what do you think we should do?
[01:13:06.178 --> 01:13:07.579]  I gave $100 to Alex and look what I got!
[01:13:07.919 --> 01:13:08.659]  I got an Alex!
[01:13:09.679 --> 01:13:10.119]  Well, you know what?
[01:13:10.159 --> 01:13:17.301]  There is like a little, little, little... It's not even really that good, but it's like this Canadian toy of Alex, where it kind of looks goofy and it's like a bendy toy.
[01:13:17.321 --> 01:13:18.921]  No, I want something that mimics the Oscars.
[01:13:19.562 --> 01:13:21.462]  The Oscar that you can put on a mantelpiece.
[01:13:21.482 --> 01:13:23.482]  Something that's, you know, worthy of a mantelpiece.
[01:13:23.783 --> 01:13:24.743]  And you guys make it up.
[01:13:25.043 --> 01:13:25.443]  Create it.
[01:13:25.743 --> 01:13:29.144]  And then those of us who want to give big money can get X amount of them or whatever.
[01:13:29.224 --> 01:13:30.465]  Alright, I'll bring it up with him, man.
[01:13:30.505 --> 01:13:32.625]  So what did you think of the film?
[01:13:32.985 --> 01:13:39.747]  Okay, number one, I have a 768 DSL, the cheap Verizon $18 a month one.
[01:13:40.088 --> 01:13:40.928]  Uh-huh.
[01:13:41.088 --> 01:13:42.288]  Seven hours to load.
[01:13:42.308 --> 01:13:42.768]  Mm-hmm.
[01:13:43.289 --> 01:13:51.271]  Okay, now this is, as far as loading, could we have more slides and cut the thing and subtitles?
[01:13:51.311 --> 01:13:52.411]  We've got to have subtitles.
[01:13:52.471 --> 01:13:53.812]  I could just barely understand it.
[01:13:54.714 --> 01:13:54.874]  Okay.
[01:14:11.019 --> 01:14:18.886]  I know there's subtitles on some of the things, but if you watch like the low-quality Flash version, and even the low-quality Flash version is like a gig, so yeah, it would take forever to load.
[01:14:18.946 --> 01:14:21.788]  I did the Windows Media... Oh, the WMV?
[01:14:22.108 --> 01:14:29.474]  Well, that one's probably the lowest quality out of all of them, and if you look, like, I know there's parts where, you know, the bomb in the bag, that's all on the bottom.
[01:14:29.534 --> 01:14:30.895]  Now, the thing is this.
[01:14:32.376 --> 01:14:37.841]  In order to load quickly, if you did it with slides and audio with a subtitle, wouldn't that
[01:14:38.382 --> 01:14:40.723]  Take out a lot of sections that could be just slides.
[01:14:40.743 --> 01:14:43.444]  Now, when you have the camera moving around, it's very distracting.
[01:14:43.484 --> 01:14:45.645]  I don't... It's hard to focus.
[01:14:46.165 --> 01:14:48.386]  It's annoying when you do it so often.
[01:14:48.406 --> 01:14:51.047]  You know, just have a slide of the person.
[01:14:51.447 --> 01:14:54.528]  And I think it would be kind of funny to do, like, uh... What is it?
[01:14:54.548 --> 01:14:56.049]  South Park, where the mouth goes open?
[01:14:56.069 --> 01:15:00.250]  All right, Leo, I gotta let you go.
[01:15:00.290 --> 01:15:03.091]  There's more of it.
[01:15:03.391 --> 01:15:05.372]  I'd like to see the timing of it, so that...
[01:15:06.041 --> 01:15:10.302]  We are here now, and like the last 10 minutes of the movie was great, I loved it!
[01:15:10.902 --> 01:15:13.363]  The rest of it was kind of like, oh yeah, yeah, I know all that stuff.
[01:15:13.723 --> 01:15:21.806]  But you know the thing is, if we start out with where we are now with the police state, what we were like before, like back in the 60s and 70s, and how did we get here?
[01:15:22.066 --> 01:15:28.848]  And more bios on the deceased, so they can check for their relatives, and show the good police versus the government parasites.
[01:15:30.039 --> 01:15:35.723]  And how people can tell signs of the NWO in their town or city and what they can do locally.
[01:15:35.743 --> 01:15:47.130]  These are the important aspects that should be in the film or on an interactive website for that specific film so people can refer to the website and then do the interactive stuff.
[01:15:47.330 --> 01:15:47.891]  Alright, Leo.
[01:15:48.131 --> 01:15:49.111]  Thanks for the info.
[01:15:49.152 --> 01:15:49.952]  I'll pass it along.
[01:15:50.012 --> 01:15:51.493]  Let's go to Steve in Colorado.
[01:15:51.533 --> 01:15:52.113]  Steve, are you with me?
[01:15:53.334 --> 01:15:54.295]  Yeah, hi there, Jason.
[01:15:54.315 --> 01:15:57.517]  Hey, I didn't catch the very first part of the program.
[01:15:59.982 --> 01:16:02.024]  One of the loose change producers, is that correct?
[01:16:02.104 --> 01:16:02.264]  Yeah.
[01:16:02.624 --> 01:16:02.864]  Okay.
[01:16:03.204 --> 01:16:04.345]  Did you guys do anything?
[01:16:04.365 --> 01:16:05.406]  I haven't seen it yet.
[01:16:05.806 --> 01:16:06.607]  Did you do anything on...
[01:16:07.991 --> 01:16:13.135]  Ted Olsen, who I guess, if I remember right, used to be the Solicitor General of the U.S.
[01:16:13.575 --> 01:16:25.783]  On his part in, I guess, faked phone calls from... Well, we didn't go into it in detail, but I do believe that in the final cut we do mention Barbara Olsen, who was the husband of Ted Olsen.
[01:16:25.803 --> 01:16:27.284]  Ted Olsen gets a quick cameo.
[01:16:27.584 --> 01:16:33.428]  But what you're discussing is that he went on television and he first said that his wife had called him from the plane.
[01:16:33.488 --> 01:16:34.789]  Now, at first they said that
[01:16:35.655 --> 01:16:49.522]  It was from a cell phone and that, you know, then they kind of backtracked and said, no, it was from an air phone, but she had told him that she couldn't find her purse, which would have made it impossible for her to call from an air phone because you would have needed a credit card to do so, correct?
[01:16:50.582 --> 01:16:50.963]  Okay.
[01:16:51.423 --> 01:17:04.249]  And, and we didn't cover that specific aspect of it, but we did mention that, you know, Barbara Olson, who was this CNN reporter and the husband of a, or I'm sorry, the wife of a solicitor general, you know, Ted Olson, we did bring up that fact.
[01:17:04.730 --> 01:17:08.371]  Yeah, she was kind of a high-profile person.
[01:17:08.691 --> 01:17:13.852]  I can't remember exactly what her background was, but yeah, she was pretty well-known, from what I remember.
[01:17:15.373 --> 01:17:26.936]  And then, also, the second thing I had was, you know, like you were mentioning about the different offices that were in Building 7, do you know of that kind of thing for the Pentagon, of why
[01:17:27.597 --> 01:17:29.078]  Yeah, whatever was going into it.
[01:17:46.630 --> 01:17:53.281]  But, uh, basically she says she was dealing with classified documents, and that when she turned on the computer, that's where the attack happened.
[01:17:53.301 --> 01:17:56.406]  So there was some operations going on there.
[01:17:56.447 --> 01:18:00.213]  I doubt that we'll ever find out what they were, because anything above top secret...
[01:18:00.928 --> 01:18:02.729]  You know, there's just it's not going to hit the public.
[01:18:02.929 --> 01:18:07.912]  However, however, I will say this, you know, Donald Rumsfeld was safe on the other side.
[01:18:08.212 --> 01:18:14.176]  This would have been the weakest place to hit the Pentagon unless it was an inside job, because again, it hit none of the main offices.
[01:18:14.476 --> 01:18:15.777]  Most of it was evacuated.
[01:18:15.977 --> 01:18:17.258]  There wasn't a big death toll.
[01:18:18.217 --> 01:18:27.545]  And it's kind of odd that they knew about this plane quote-unquote supposedly going into the White House and then into, this is supposedly the one that hit the Pentagon, and they didn't warn anybody.
[01:18:27.665 --> 01:18:29.067]  There were no alarm bells going off.
[01:18:29.407 --> 01:18:34.631]  Yet they evacuated Cheney and Mineta, and they're both in the PEOC, before this happens.
[01:18:35.492 --> 01:18:36.853]  Yeah, okay, I was going to bring that up.
[01:18:36.913 --> 01:18:43.699]  The part that I guess is on YouTube, or the video, excuse me, that's on YouTube, that has the actual
[01:18:44.904 --> 01:18:49.857]  Or has the testimony of Norm Mineta before the 9-11 Commission?
[01:18:50.642 --> 01:18:51.903]  Okay, was that where it was at?
[01:18:51.923 --> 01:18:52.163]  Okay.
[01:18:52.323 --> 01:18:52.443]  Yeah.
[01:18:52.483 --> 01:18:53.743]  Where he was talking about that.
[01:18:53.763 --> 01:18:55.324]  Do you guys include that, perchance?
[01:18:55.444 --> 01:18:56.884]  Oh yeah, that's in Loose Change Final Cut, man.
[01:18:56.904 --> 01:18:58.925]  You can go watch it for free at Google Video right now.
[01:18:58.965 --> 01:19:01.966]  You get the high-quality thing over at Prison Planner InfoWars.
[01:19:01.986 --> 01:19:03.307]  But yeah, that's absolutely in there.
[01:19:03.787 --> 01:19:04.187]  Oh, great!
[01:19:04.227 --> 01:19:06.408]  And he confirmed that two other times.
[01:19:06.688 --> 01:19:19.633]  In fact, over at my blog, LooseChange911.com, I actually have Minetta saying the same exact story five separate times, on five different occasions, one year after the fact on ABC, in front of the 9-11 Commission, in front of a We Are Change group,
[01:19:19.973 --> 01:19:21.815]  And on yet another special on CNN.
[01:19:22.135 --> 01:19:23.397]  So it's well documented.
[01:19:23.637 --> 01:19:27.381]  They just covered it all up in the 9-11 Commission and said Cheney wasn't there until 955.
[01:19:27.421 --> 01:19:28.142]  Believe your government.
[01:19:28.362 --> 01:19:29.503]  Steve, I thank you for the call.
[01:19:29.743 --> 01:19:31.325]  We're going to take more callers.
[01:19:31.745 --> 01:19:36.050]  Remember, 9-11 Chronicles Truth Rising has hit PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:38.292]  Get it in high quality now or order the DVD today.
[01:19:38.312 --> 01:19:39.794]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:50.612 --> 01:19:52.633]  Good morning, this is Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:19:52.733 --> 01:19:53.354]  July 3rd, 2008.
[01:19:53.414 --> 01:19:53.994]  Gold opened at $9.3050.
[01:19:54.054 --> 01:19:56.775]  One ounce gold coins can be purchased for $9.5727, $4.7145 for half, and $2.3573 for quarter ounce.
[01:19:56.815 --> 01:19:57.496]  That's $9.5727, $4.7145, and $2.3573.
[01:20:08.422 --> 01:20:10.904]  Hedge funds caught in the malaise of mortgage bankruptcies.
[01:20:10.944 --> 01:20:12.625]  The bond market continues to slump.
[01:20:12.785 --> 01:20:13.085]  J.P.
[01:20:13.125 --> 01:20:15.907]  Morgan gets caught in a $10 billion bad deal for Chrysler.
[01:20:15.947 --> 01:20:17.989]  Housing sales fell 6.6%.
[01:20:18.069 --> 01:20:22.632]  Mortgage giant Countrywide showed mortgage payment woes spreading to the middle and upper class.
[01:20:22.672 --> 01:20:24.933]  Investors cast doubt on investment banks.
[01:20:25.053 --> 01:20:29.176]  Credit protection insurance for mortgage lenders are skyrocketing due to the increased risk.
[01:20:29.497 --> 01:20:29.857]  The U.S.
[01:20:29.917 --> 01:20:33.960]  dollar is free-falling against foreign currencies and countries that previously financed the U.S.
[01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:35.701]  are now seeking safer alternatives.
[01:20:36.121 --> 01:20:38.703]  Economist Rody Boyd published the report, Bubble Leaking.
[01:20:38.963 --> 01:20:40.083]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[01:20:40.203 --> 01:20:45.386]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[01:20:45.486 --> 01:20:45.686]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:45.706 --> 01:20:45.886]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:51.454 --> 01:20:54.796]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[01:20:55.216 --> 01:20:59.798]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[01:21:00.258 --> 01:21:05.480]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:16.245]  Though the people of the U.S., where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reigning them in and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[01:21:16.705 --> 01:21:20.667]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[01:21:21.087 --> 01:21:21.727]  We're good to go.
[01:21:50.422 --> 01:21:52.545]  Hey Bonnie, no more pickpocketing for us.
[01:21:52.805 --> 01:21:56.971]  I have an easier way we can steal people's credit cards without them even knowing they've been robbed.
[01:21:57.151 --> 01:21:58.253]  How so, Clyde?
[01:21:58.433 --> 01:22:01.177]  I have this RFID reader I picked up on the internet.
[01:22:01.357 --> 01:22:06.024]  Just by waving it near you, I can skim your credit card information while your cards are still in your purse.
[01:22:06.224 --> 01:22:06.745]  Just watch.
[01:22:07.352 --> 01:22:09.294]  Hey look, that's my info on the screen.
[01:22:09.434 --> 01:22:10.675]  You gotta be kidding me.
[01:22:10.916 --> 01:22:11.176]  Nope.
[01:22:11.316 --> 01:22:15.380]  With 50 million credit cards with hidden RFID chips, I figure we'll make a fortune.
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:17.822]  As long as people don't hear about Identity Stronghold.
[01:22:18.043 --> 01:22:18.363]  Why?
[01:22:18.563 --> 01:22:20.345]  What's Identity Stronghold?
[01:22:20.525 --> 01:22:21.866]  They make the Secure Sleeve.
[01:22:22.087 --> 01:22:25.630]  When people keep their credit cards in the shielded Secure Sleeve, I can't read them.
[01:22:25.670 --> 01:22:28.653]  Do a lot of people already know about the Secure Sleeve?
[01:22:28.753 --> 01:22:29.294]  No way.
[01:22:29.594 --> 01:22:32.979]  Most people don't realize they even have chips in their credit cards and passports.
[01:22:33.139 --> 01:22:35.783]  Clyde, we should get some of those secure sleeves.
[01:22:35.903 --> 01:22:36.804]  I already got some.
[01:22:37.005 --> 01:22:38.687]  I also got some to fit our passports.
[01:22:38.927 --> 01:22:43.614]  Identity Stronghold has secure sleeves for sale right on the internet at idstronghold.com.
[01:22:43.915 --> 01:22:45.457]  idstronghold.com?
[01:22:45.737 --> 01:22:46.078]  Right!

[01:23:03.619 --> 01:23:06.882]  Accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:23:07.162 --> 01:23:11.106]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:23:11.406 --> 01:23:16.330]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.TV is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[01:23:16.611 --> 01:23:19.373]  PrisonPlanet.TV is a vault of forbidden information.

[01:23:48.499 --> 01:23:49.239]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:24:02.310 --> 01:24:07.094]  Aww, a little more Dylan!
[01:24:08.575 --> 01:24:12.078]  I'll take it on this sunny 4th of July, Independence Day.
[01:24:12.238 --> 01:24:13.519]  It's the Alex Jones Show, folks.
[01:24:13.579 --> 01:24:14.380]  I'm Jason Burmess.
[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:18.163]  If you want to get at me, it's MySpace.com slash Jason Burmess.
[01:24:19.584 --> 01:24:23.207]  I am one of the producers of Loose Change, working on a new flick down here in Austin, Texas.
[01:24:24.067 --> 01:24:26.669]  Hopefully coming at you September 1st, Fabled Enemies.
[01:24:26.769 --> 01:24:27.170]  Get ready.
[01:24:27.190 --> 01:24:28.651]  It's going to have the Barry Jennings interview.
[01:24:29.326 --> 01:24:32.947]  Very successful story here at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:24:33.967 --> 01:24:37.788]  Over 50,000 views on YouTube in just a couple of weeks.
[01:24:38.169 --> 01:24:39.049]  Less than two weeks, I think.
[01:24:40.249 --> 01:24:42.430]  In dozens of different versions.
[01:24:43.530 --> 01:24:47.491]  But today is the launch of Truth Rising.
[01:24:47.531 --> 01:24:50.292]  We launched a little early yesterday, but this is the official launch.
[01:24:51.352 --> 01:24:52.693]  And we're all really proud of this film here.
[01:24:54.813 --> 01:24:55.573]  Myself included.
[01:24:55.613 --> 01:24:57.174]  I had very little to do with it, but I did
[01:24:58.490 --> 01:25:25.042]  Actually design the DVD cover and that sort of thing and watch as Rob Jacobson edited it for the last couple of months really checking it out and pointing out you know how how what well it's done I mean it's it's cinema verite it is just truly different from anything Alex Jones has ever put out before with interviews with people like Jesse Ventura, Willie Nelson, Martin Sheen, George Carlin, Rosie O'Donnell, Christine Ebersole.
[01:25:25.522 --> 01:25:27.483]  This film is unlike anything
[01:25:28.311 --> 01:25:30.592]  I think the movement has ever seen.
[01:25:30.772 --> 01:25:33.493]  I mean it really is just an excellent, excellent movie.
[01:25:34.413 --> 01:25:39.375]  And before we jump to your calls, I want to take time to thank our sponsors.
[01:25:39.655 --> 01:25:41.896]  They help support this show and we hope you support them.

[01:26:54.292 --> 01:26:59.255]  Actually, you know, for you guys that are all going to be drinking all day, you might want to pop a little bit of this with your brewskis.
[01:26:59.815 --> 01:27:01.076]  Keep you up so you don't fall asleep.
[01:27:02.097 --> 01:27:07.200]  Then again, I know we've got some pretty big warriors out there on the 4th of July.
[01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:08.781]  Try to be careful, too, folks.
[01:27:08.821 --> 01:27:11.823]  I haven't said that, but drinking and driving is not a good thing.
[01:27:11.863 --> 01:27:16.306]  That's not something we promote over here at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:27:16.766 --> 01:27:17.847]  We want you to be safe today.
[01:27:17.887 --> 01:27:19.908]  We do want you to have a good time, and
[01:27:21.081 --> 01:27:30.609]  If you're a PrisonPlanet.tv member, we want you to download the movie in high quality DivX format and play it on your DivX player, your DVD player, most of them play DivX these days.

[01:27:32.490 --> 01:27:33.071]  Today's the day.
[01:27:33.111 --> 01:27:35.272]  I said it earlier today and I'm gonna say it again.
[01:27:35.673 --> 01:27:36.513]  You're gonna see your friends.
[01:27:36.533 --> 01:27:37.514]  You're gonna see your family.
[01:27:37.855 --> 01:27:39.196]  This information is vital.
[01:27:39.236 --> 01:27:40.897]  We don't really know how much time we have.
[01:27:41.397 --> 01:27:45.240]  We need to educate people that Barack Obama is not going to save the world.
[01:27:46.141 --> 01:27:46.762]  Did you know that?
[01:27:47.422 --> 01:27:48.763]  Yeah, Barack's not saving the world.
[01:27:48.843 --> 01:27:49.584]  Get with it.
[01:27:50.822 --> 01:27:51.362]  Get hip to it.
[01:27:51.703 --> 01:27:53.063]  Clinton's about to campaign for the man.
[01:27:53.263 --> 01:27:54.264]  Clinton is not a good person.
[01:27:55.845 --> 01:27:57.086]  Alright, let's jump to these other callers.
[01:27:57.126 --> 01:27:58.967]  Let's go to Mark in Georgia.
[01:27:59.027 --> 01:27:59.807]  Mark, what's on your mind?
[01:28:00.408 --> 01:28:01.248]  Well, a few things.
[01:28:01.288 --> 01:28:04.210]  So I'll try and hit them in a rapid sequence here.
[01:28:04.230 --> 01:28:06.911]  I was dealing with his erstwhile friend.
[01:28:08.032 --> 01:28:09.313]  Not very well educated.
[01:28:09.333 --> 01:28:10.633]  I told him he was a sycophant.
[01:28:10.653 --> 01:28:12.374]  He thought I was paying him a compliment.
[01:28:12.394 --> 01:28:14.936]  And he called me a paranoid schizophrenic.
[01:28:15.336 --> 01:28:18.238]  Well, not even I know what the word schizophrenic really means.
[01:28:19.244 --> 01:28:22.746]  I said, well, the thing is, you're an Aletheophobe.
[01:28:24.567 --> 01:28:27.728]  That's a person with a morbid irrational fear of the truth.
[01:28:27.808 --> 01:28:30.149]  Aletheia means truth in Greek.
[01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:34.251]  I think that some of these people need a ramp.
[01:28:34.791 --> 01:28:41.975]  They hit the wall, they need a ramp or a stairwell they can climb up that kind of explains to them, you know, kind of an introductory thing.
[01:28:42.855 --> 01:28:44.636]  Your project is the thing that woke me up.
[01:28:45.096 --> 01:28:45.476]  Oh, cool.
[01:28:45.636 --> 01:28:46.777]  And I thank you for that.
[01:28:47.972 --> 01:29:13.347]  I was thinking, with Mark Dice's, this is one of a number of points that I've hit in rapid sequence, that with Mark Dice's thing of inform a soldier, I appreciate that he wants to send them information, but I'm thinking along the lines that if we could put together a specific project that explains to the soldiers about their oath of office, and that on 10th, I hear these neocons talk about the 10th of September mentality,
[01:29:13.891 --> 01:29:15.092]  And I just sent in a rebuttal.
[01:29:15.112 --> 01:29:15.993]  Alright, hold on Mark.
[01:29:16.013 --> 01:29:16.873]  We're going to stay with you.
[01:29:16.933 --> 01:29:17.374]  Hold over.
[01:29:17.394 --> 01:29:18.774]  We're going to have you on the other side.
[01:29:19.115 --> 01:29:20.376]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:20.416 --> 01:29:21.556]  It is Independence Day.
[01:29:21.596 --> 01:29:22.917]  Truth Rising has dropped.
[01:29:23.138 --> 01:29:24.879]  It's over at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:29:25.299 --> 01:29:26.340]  And we'll be back after this.
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:27.741]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:41.024 --> 01:29:44.046]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:44.966 --> 01:29:47.768]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:50.730 --> 01:29:52.211]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Dimon.

[01:30:50.456 --> 01:30:55.940]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[01:30:56.180 --> 01:30:57.481]  And we knew what to do.
[01:30:57.501 --> 01:30:59.283]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:30:59.503 --> 01:31:05.927]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:31:06.528 --> 01:31:13.273]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air
[01:31:13.956 --> 01:31:15.077]  We're safe to breathe.
[01:31:15.097 --> 01:31:17.119]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:31:17.139 --> 01:31:19.501]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[01:31:31.471 --> 01:31:34.112]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[01:31:43.515 --> 01:31:48.457]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[01:31:49.912 --> 01:31:52.133]  Have you heard about American Free Press?

[01:32:41.263 --> 01:32:44.264]  Once again, that's AmericanFreePress.net.
[01:32:44.604 --> 01:32:48.986]  American Free Press, the voice of the Second American Revolution.
[01:33:07.153 --> 01:33:09.297]  Happy 4th of July to all you out there.
[01:33:09.317 --> 01:33:10.981]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:11.762 --> 01:33:13.305]  The launch of Truth Rising.
[01:33:13.325 --> 01:33:17.634]  It's over at PrisonPlanet.tv right now on the highest of quality.
[01:33:17.654 --> 01:33:19.076]  You can get it on DivX.
[01:33:20.057 --> 01:33:22.538]  Burn it to DVD, play it on your DivX DVD player.
[01:33:22.578 --> 01:33:23.218]  It's that simple.
[01:33:23.258 --> 01:33:26.420]  It's getting that much easier to fight the Info War.
[01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:28.841]  We've got Mark in Georgia on the line.
[01:33:28.861 --> 01:33:38.025]  He was discussing some other projects, possibly one directed directly at the soldiers to show them exactly what's happened to the military and themselves.
[01:33:38.285 --> 01:33:38.865]  Continue, Mark.
[01:33:39.766 --> 01:33:40.186]  Ah, yes.
[01:33:40.686 --> 01:33:48.910]  When I was in the Weekend Warrior at Charleston Air Force Base, I saw in the latrine, and I'm going to modify this for obvious reasons,
[01:33:49.821 --> 01:33:53.782]  That a lifer is a lazy, ignorant fornicator expecting retirement.
[01:33:54.362 --> 01:34:07.886]  Now, as we understand it now, and I mentioned this to Colonel Bowman when he was in town recently about the crash of the Pentagon, it's like, yeah, the records that they needed to find out where the money went was right where the plane hit.
[01:34:08.146 --> 01:34:09.047]  And I'm like, really?
[01:34:09.767 --> 01:34:13.848]  So here's these guys expecting retirement, and it's like,
[01:34:14.620 --> 01:34:20.703]  Even if you were having grossly inflated currency for your retirement, you expect the money's gonna be there?
[01:34:21.583 --> 01:34:32.909]  Uh, you know, I'd like to see about getting, uh, like, officer-friendly Jack McLam involved in terms of reminding them of their oath of office, that it is the enemy domestic that we need to contend with.
[01:34:33.369 --> 01:34:43.694]  I tried to tell my, um, aletheophobic mother about, uh, um, there's a tract, actually, it's a couple of tracts that were combined, it's a couple of articles that were combined into a tract
[01:34:44.295 --> 01:34:52.397]  It's called Foundations Paid Away by Alan Stang, and I put it on, I basically converted it to a PDF format and uploaded it to my site.
[01:34:52.577 --> 01:35:05.880]  It's available, doyoulovejesus.org, that's letter U, slash Foundations, with a capital F, dot PDF, that's Papa Delta Foxtrot, or Portable Document Format.
[01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:13.362]  And so that track is available, and I believe that if the people are in uniform, whether in the
[01:35:14.463 --> 01:35:35.131]  And the civil authorities here in the United States, or overseas, or wherever they may be, need to be reminded that the enemy domestic, I think maybe we ought to put the material together where the Founding Fathers explained in this project, where the Founding Fathers warned that the real threat would be corruption from within.
[01:35:35.252 --> 01:35:37.953]  That's right, the Republic could only fall from the inside, Mark.
[01:35:37.993 --> 01:35:38.913]  I thank you for the call.
[01:35:39.133 --> 01:35:41.254]  I mean, so many people said, look,
[01:35:42.051 --> 01:35:43.312]  Yes sir, Jason, you're doing a great job.
[01:35:43.452 --> 01:35:45.213]  I've got a new slant on Building 7.
[01:35:45.333 --> 01:35:47.615]  It's maybe not new, but I have not heard a lot of people talk about it.
[01:35:47.635 --> 01:35:48.396]  With Larry Silverstein saying that
[01:36:03.166 --> 01:36:06.447]  We've had such a loss of life and we decided we should just pull.
[01:36:07.647 --> 01:36:19.010]  Even with that, that doesn't ever add up because if you know a little bit about demolition, it takes days or months to design a demo.
[01:36:19.431 --> 01:36:19.651]  Sure.
[01:36:20.271 --> 01:36:22.932]  It takes months to install the demo.
[01:36:23.772 --> 01:36:24.052]  Okay.
[01:36:24.872 --> 01:36:31.794]  So for him to get on TV and say, well, we just decided to pull it that day of, is totally incredulous.
[01:36:32.498 --> 01:36:37.482]  And totally, just, there's no way you can rig a building to be full the day of.
[01:36:37.562 --> 01:36:40.544]  I don't necessarily think that he said, let's rig it for demolition.
[01:36:40.584 --> 01:36:42.426]  He probably knew it was rigged for demolition.
[01:36:42.646 --> 01:36:44.787]  No, he said we decided to pull it.
[01:36:45.028 --> 01:36:50.452]  Yeah, well exactly, but if it already had the bombs in the building and he knew that, that it had a, say it had a contingency plan.
[01:36:50.472 --> 01:36:52.033]  I mean, this was Secret Service.
[01:36:52.433 --> 01:36:53.894]  Oh yeah.
[01:36:54.414 --> 01:37:00.377]  This took months to prepare, and I don't think that gets hammered home enough to people that don't understand.
[01:37:00.597 --> 01:37:01.238]  No, I agree.
[01:37:01.318 --> 01:37:02.478]  It did take months to prepare.
[01:37:02.518 --> 01:37:03.859]  Those bombs were pre-positioned.
[01:37:04.359 --> 01:37:07.161]  Larry Silverstein wasn't the one that put the bombs in the building.
[01:37:07.321 --> 01:37:12.063]  You know, he obviously, I think, was aware that there were explosives in the building.
[01:37:12.423 --> 01:37:17.025]  I do believe that it's not going to matter because the BBC is going to tell us the building fell from fire.
[01:37:17.146 --> 01:37:21.968]  I mean, two days from now, the BBC is going to solve the mystery of 9-11, which they're calling the final mystery.
[01:37:22.168 --> 01:37:22.308]  Oh yeah.
[01:37:34.304 --> 01:37:40.366]  No, just anybody out there that's got half a mind or doubt in this, think about how long it would take to repair this.
[01:37:40.386 --> 01:37:46.948]  I mean, you're talking about drilling probably 50 holes per floor, 2,300 holes in concrete columns.
[01:37:47.288 --> 01:37:49.328]  That takes a long time to set up.
[01:37:49.768 --> 01:37:55.590]  You know, now that you brought that up, I want to bring up yet another piece of evidence for demolition.
[01:37:55.610 --> 01:37:56.790]  And I thank you for the call, Carl.
[01:37:56.810 --> 01:37:58.070]  We're going to take more callers in a moment.
[01:37:58.611 --> 01:37:59.991]  But in the beginning of Truth Rising,
[01:38:01.164 --> 01:38:03.825]  There's a shot of the World Trade Center Cross.
[01:38:03.885 --> 01:38:23.172]  Now for you, for those out there that don't know what the World Trade Center Cross is, it is a piece of the building, two pieces of steel, that were somehow fused together in the form of a cross at the site of Ground Zero, not by man, but by the demolition of World Trade Center 1 or 2, underground zero.
[01:38:23.552 --> 01:38:30.195]  And it also had moltenized iron or another form of metal, didn't look like aluminum to me, might have been
[01:38:31.530 --> 01:38:32.571]  Might have been something other than iron.
[01:38:32.611 --> 01:38:34.492]  But anyway, it was hanging off the side.
[01:38:34.532 --> 01:38:35.832]  Now, all of this had been moltenite.
[01:38:36.033 --> 01:38:44.277]  You gotta understand, two steel beams being fused together, fused together in the shape of a cross, doesn't happen from jet fuel.
[01:38:44.678 --> 01:38:45.038]  Okay?
[01:38:45.798 --> 01:38:47.419]  It happens from high temperatures.
[01:38:47.699 --> 01:38:52.802]  Now, again, the official version people will say, there's no proof of molten metal underneath.
[01:38:53.663 --> 01:38:54.303]  There's none.
[01:38:54.323 --> 01:38:59.146]  I'm John Grossenist, and I don't know of anybody who saw any molten metal.
[01:38:59.773 --> 01:39:10.791]  You know, though we reported it, though the fires ran until late December, I mean, though we have molten metal pouring out of the World Trade Center prior to its collapse, none of it's real, apparently.
[01:39:11.793 --> 01:39:17.215]  Apparently we all imagined it and somehow it formed itself, but it's all due to the official version.
[01:39:17.255 --> 01:39:18.216]  These people make me sick.
[01:39:18.596 --> 01:39:24.758]  The thermal imagery shows that the intense hotspots could not have been created by jet fuel fires.
[01:39:25.158 --> 01:39:25.419]  Okay?
[01:39:25.919 --> 01:39:27.199]  John Gross doesn't want to look at those.
[01:39:27.399 --> 01:39:29.000]  So that's the NASA imagery.
[01:39:29.300 --> 01:39:29.840]  Okay, folks?
[01:39:30.481 --> 01:39:31.221]  God, man.
[01:39:31.461 --> 01:39:32.421]  When are we going to wise up?
[01:39:32.701 --> 01:39:39.024]  You know, if you're listening right now and you've got a little time on this 4th of July, you've already seen truth rising.
[01:39:40.054 --> 01:39:41.375]  Or you haven't seen Truth Rising.
[01:39:41.415 --> 01:39:45.817]  Either way, you need to email this guy at the BBC and just let him know the jig's up.
[01:39:46.137 --> 01:39:49.218]  And he's like, oh, I need you to preserve judgment till after the show.
[01:39:49.338 --> 01:39:51.600]  No, you really don't, because I know what your game is.
[01:39:52.260 --> 01:39:53.981]  It's about lying and distorting the truth.
[01:39:54.241 --> 01:39:54.841]  And you sicken me.
[01:39:55.261 --> 01:39:57.182]  All right, let's go to Chris in Kentucky.
[01:39:57.202 --> 01:39:57.742]  Chris, are you there?
[01:39:59.403 --> 01:39:59.924]  Chris, you with me?
[01:40:01.124 --> 01:40:01.904]  Do I not have Chris?
[01:40:02.265 --> 01:40:02.765]  Hello, Jason.
[01:40:02.865 --> 01:40:03.505]  Hey, what's up, Chris?
[01:40:03.865 --> 01:40:05.966]  Hey, thanks for waking me up as well.
[01:40:05.986 --> 01:40:07.127]  No problem.
[01:40:07.557 --> 01:40:18.580]  There's a couple of news items here in the state of Kentucky that came up a few days ago that since the high price of gas is getting so expensive to the taxpayers, well, the Kentucky State Police want to save gas by having roadblocks.
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:20.441]  Have you heard that in any other states as well?
[01:40:20.961 --> 01:40:23.042]  Wait a minute, they want what for roadblocks?
[01:40:23.082 --> 01:40:23.662]  State gas?
[01:40:23.742 --> 01:40:27.243]  What are they going to do, block off the entryways to other states so people can get it cheaper?
[01:40:27.723 --> 01:40:31.384]  So they can just, you know, they can go to the most dangerous roads.
[01:40:31.664 --> 01:40:36.726]  What the spokesman of the Kentucky State Police said on a newscast today before WHAS here in Louisville,
[01:40:37.291 --> 01:40:41.815]  I heard that and I think, what are they conditioning, what are they up to?
[01:40:41.855 --> 01:40:46.839]  Let me tell you, not only the gas, but the price of living has gone up so much.
[01:40:47.279 --> 01:40:49.641]  Now I'm in Texas, regular gas is still under $4.
[01:40:49.841 --> 01:40:53.544]  I was just in New York, regular gas was like $4.35 in upstate New York.
[01:40:53.824 --> 01:40:57.007]  That means it's close to $5, maybe $5.50 down in the city.
[01:40:57.467 --> 01:40:59.709]  Now on top of that, they just upped the price of cigarettes.
[01:41:00.342 --> 01:41:00.903]  In New York.
[01:41:00.963 --> 01:41:02.484]  So again, I'm in upstate New York.
[01:41:02.504 --> 01:41:04.085]  I think it's like $7.50 a pack.
[01:41:04.125 --> 01:41:04.745]  I don't even smoke.
[01:41:05.046 --> 01:41:06.066]  My friends are complaining to me.
[01:41:06.247 --> 01:41:06.887]  Down in the city, it's $10.
[01:41:08.148 --> 01:41:09.169]  I mean, can you imagine?
[01:41:09.389 --> 01:41:11.250]  $10 for a pack of smokes.
[01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:12.071]  $5 for a gallon of gas.
[01:41:12.131 --> 01:41:18.916]  Anybody who drives and smokes now has an extra, especially if you smoke a pack a day, I gotta figure you're spending an extra $100 to $200 a week on
[01:41:22.088 --> 01:41:22.589]  On garbage.
[01:41:22.810 --> 01:41:23.291]  On lies.
[01:41:23.331 --> 01:41:31.672]  I mean, the tobacco companies lose lawsuits, and then the taxpayers end up paying for it, and the smokers just end up having to pay more to get cancer.
[01:41:32.617 --> 01:41:34.297]  I mean, the system is so twisted.
[01:41:34.317 --> 01:41:38.158]  And then to say that you're not allowed to go get gas in another state because it's cheaper?
[01:41:38.578 --> 01:41:46.881]  I mean, people would be outraged if you did that in New York because, believe it or not, New Jersey still has much cheaper gas than New York City and the border is right there.
[01:41:46.901 --> 01:41:51.382]  I know a lot of people that go directly to Jersey because gas is about $1.52 cheaper.
[01:41:51.662 --> 01:41:56.783]  When they start regulating you by your license plate or where you're from stateside to get gas,
[01:41:57.913 --> 01:41:59.214]  Yeah, that's scary stuff.
[01:41:59.274 --> 01:42:00.455]  I had not heard that story.
[01:42:00.495 --> 01:42:05.378]  I would suggest you email it over to Aaron at Infowars.com or tips at Infowars.com.
[01:42:05.418 --> 01:42:06.979]  You got anything else for me, Chris?
[01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:15.065]  Yeah, it's also, we did have the newspaper here, the Courier-Journal here in Louisville also now, so they're going to have massive roadblocks of checkpoints everywhere this weekend.
[01:42:15.105 --> 01:42:16.546]  So this is not freedom this weekend.
[01:42:17.006 --> 01:42:21.970]  No, it's definitely not, and it'll all be in light of, you know, drunk drivers and all this other stuff, but
[01:42:22.540 --> 01:42:26.282]  You know, I understand where people are like, well, we need to save lives.
[01:42:26.422 --> 01:42:27.083]  It's a holiday.
[01:42:27.123 --> 01:42:31.545]  But what we don't need is Fourth Amendment breaking checkpoints.
[01:42:31.605 --> 01:42:33.366]  If somebody is swerving on the road, that's great.
[01:42:33.406 --> 01:42:34.267]  Double the cops today.
[01:42:34.287 --> 01:42:35.247]  I have no problem with that.
[01:42:36.448 --> 01:42:36.688]  Yeah.
[01:42:36.728 --> 01:42:38.309]  Just don't stop us for no reason.
[01:42:38.329 --> 01:42:38.489]  Yeah.
[01:42:38.529 --> 01:42:39.830]  That's triple the cops today.
[01:42:40.070 --> 01:42:40.370]  Whatever.
[01:42:40.410 --> 01:42:41.271]  Have them on the lookout.
[01:42:41.311 --> 01:42:43.792]  You know, there's enough rats out there anyway today.
[01:42:43.852 --> 01:42:46.714]  If someone swerves just slightly off the road, everybody's got a cell phone.
[01:42:46.954 --> 01:42:49.095]  I know plenty of people that call it in, you know,
[01:42:49.716 --> 01:43:01.623]  There's no reason to have us stop, let me see your papers, okay, get out of the car, and then even if you're not drunk or haven't done anything illegal, oh I see you don't have your seatbelt on, well there's a $200 fine, here you go sir, just pull over for a moment.
[01:43:02.264 --> 01:43:03.264]  It's a total rape fest.
[01:43:04.405 --> 01:43:08.948]  And that's what they're conditioning with this high price of gas by just having the state police sit at checkpoint.
[01:43:08.968 --> 01:43:09.868]  Yeah, absolutely man.
[01:43:09.909 --> 01:43:10.949]  Alright, thank you Chris.
[01:43:10.969 --> 01:43:13.191]  We're going to jump to the next caller.
[01:43:13.611 --> 01:43:15.532]  Let's go to Louie in Texas.
[01:43:15.572 --> 01:43:16.052]  What's up Louie?
[01:43:18.328 --> 01:43:18.849]  What's on your mind?
[01:43:18.869 --> 01:43:19.589]  Yes, what's on your mind?
[01:43:19.629 --> 01:43:20.430]  You're on the air.
[01:43:20.450 --> 01:43:25.394]  Hey, you're going to have Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster pretty soon?
[01:43:25.574 --> 01:43:26.695]  Yeah, he's going to be on at 1 o'clock.
[01:43:27.356 --> 01:43:27.636]  Okay.
[01:43:28.177 --> 01:43:34.202]  I'm just wondering, one little thing I was thinking about is we're getting payments, you know, that refund check.
[01:43:34.262 --> 01:43:35.463]  Yeah, the $600 check.
[01:43:35.663 --> 01:43:35.903]  Yes.
[01:43:36.604 --> 01:43:40.307]  And then money from the state also, if you're on a pension and things like that.
[01:43:40.347 --> 01:43:45.812]  Doesn't the Constitution require federal and states to pay what they owe in silver and gold?
[01:43:47.232 --> 01:43:49.334]  They have a class action action right there.
[01:43:49.674 --> 01:43:53.417]  Well, I think they changed that when they brought in the Federal Reserve Banking System, right?
[01:43:53.437 --> 01:43:54.819]  I'm pretty sure that's what it was.
[01:43:54.839 --> 01:43:57.541]  I don't think they had a constitutional amendment for that.
[01:43:57.961 --> 01:43:59.923]  All right, well, what do you want me to ask Chapman?
[01:44:00.383 --> 01:44:07.950]  I'll ask him if there's a possibility to kick-start class action in every state for any payment you get from the state or federal government.
[01:44:08.130 --> 01:44:09.711]  That is not silver or gold.
[01:44:09.731 --> 01:44:10.712]  All right, I'll ask him that, man.
[01:44:10.752 --> 01:44:11.733]  I thank you for the call.
[01:44:12.053 --> 01:44:14.875]  Let's jump to Joe in Pennsylvania.
[01:44:14.975 --> 01:44:15.696]  Joe, what's happening?
[01:44:16.289 --> 01:44:17.329]  Hey, how are you doing, Jason?
[01:44:17.429 --> 01:44:17.830]  Good, man.
[01:44:18.610 --> 01:44:43.057]  Listen, I've got to tell you, I downloaded, I'm a Prison Planet team member, and I downloaded Truth Rising, and about 20 minutes into it, I mean, I just started weeping, because, you know, there's so many people, you guys put so much effort into this, and my heart goes out to all those people that were, you know, they were arguing back and forth, and they don't realize that you guys are down there trying to help, and they don't know.
[01:44:43.917 --> 01:44:44.738]  They don't know.
[01:44:46.260 --> 01:44:55.225]  You know, I just, it's an incredible effort and it just made me want to, you know, like I said, I've been on before, I'm in a wheelchair, I'm quadriplegic, and I want to get down there.
[01:44:55.945 --> 01:45:01.428]  And I don't know, I got some people here that may be able to bring me down on September 11th, that's the one coming up.
[01:45:01.648 --> 01:45:01.848]  Yep.
[01:45:02.028 --> 01:45:08.291]  But it's a fantastic video, and not only that, there's so many more sources out there.
[01:45:08.331 --> 01:45:12.133]  These people, you know, they call you guys nutjobs, Alex Jones is a nutjob.
[01:45:12.514 --> 01:45:15.315]  They don't realize, like, I go on the internet and I look at
[01:45:16.055 --> 01:45:25.057]  You know, hundreds of sources of different people exposing the truth, and that BBC guy that's gonna supposedly discredit the Building 7 thing?
[01:45:25.497 --> 01:45:38.181]  He's going to look stupid because, you know, it's not just... There's so much information out there to the contrary, and I have people, you know, they're called sheeple, right?
[01:45:38.561 --> 01:45:38.741]  Yes.
[01:45:38.841 --> 01:45:43.162]  And I got a guy that I racked, a buddy of mine, just emailed me and said,
[01:45:44.257 --> 01:45:46.538]  I wished him a happy Fourth of July.
[01:45:46.558 --> 01:45:51.439]  I asked him how he was doing, and he said, you know, we don't need to be here.
[01:45:51.459 --> 01:45:52.479]  They need to get the U.S.
[01:45:52.579 --> 01:45:55.499]  out because, he said, Afghans don't want them there.
[01:45:55.519 --> 01:45:58.540]  He said they're basically big targets.
[01:45:59.320 --> 01:45:59.940]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:00.800]  But you know what?
[01:46:00.820 --> 01:46:02.481]  Let me just stop you for a second.
[01:46:02.921 --> 01:46:08.042]  They have now set it up to make sure people understand that there is no getting out of Afghanistan.
[01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:15.925]  Let's see, I did the show two weeks ago, a little over two weeks ago, and the big news on Friday was, oh, prison break!
[01:46:15.985 --> 01:46:17.086]  Kandahar prison break!
[01:46:17.126 --> 01:46:19.948]  A thousand people escaped, many of them Taliban.
[01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:25.922]  On Monday, it was Taliban have a new stronghold in Afghanistan, and they've been hyping that up the past couple weeks.
[01:46:26.322 --> 01:46:28.522]  By Monday afternoon, it was reported that the U.S.
[01:46:28.562 --> 01:46:32.203]  forces gave the green light for that attack, and they may have even helped.
[01:46:32.343 --> 01:46:34.184]  Well, they did that because they're not going anywhere.
[01:46:34.204 --> 01:46:36.064]  They need an external threat.
[01:46:36.104 --> 01:46:40.446]  They need an enemy to fight or people get hip to it, just like your soldier friend.
[01:46:40.906 --> 01:46:47.268]  And you know that a lot of the soldiers know over there there's no reason to be in Afghanistan other than to secure some rich guy's interests.
[01:46:47.668 --> 01:46:48.628]  I mean, it's sad, man.
[01:46:49.247 --> 01:46:53.868]  And I hope that movies like this one show how we can make a difference over here.
[01:46:54.128 --> 01:46:58.109]  You know, we need to help those people over there by making people aware over here.
[01:46:58.129 --> 01:46:58.930]  And you're right, man.
[01:46:58.970 --> 01:47:06.331]  It does make me very, very sad and disheartened sometimes when I'm talking to somebody, and you're right, I'm trying to help, and they just don't get it.
[01:47:06.411 --> 01:47:09.352]  But I really feel like we can break through that facade.
[01:47:09.372 --> 01:47:09.872]  You know what I mean?
[01:47:10.252 --> 01:47:16.194]  Well, they're coming home, and I am encouraging them to not re-enlist.
[01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:23.862]  And I want to show him the videos, and there was a guy, a kid, he came up to me, and he's like, oh, I just got a $30,000 a year job.
[01:47:23.882 --> 01:47:25.002]  I'm going into the military.
[01:47:25.042 --> 01:47:27.643]  And I said, listen, if it's about money, I said, did you do your training?
[01:47:28.203 --> 01:47:29.363]  He said, yeah, I did my training.
[01:47:29.423 --> 01:47:31.484]  I said, did you sign documents and all that?
[01:47:31.504 --> 01:47:32.024]  He said, yeah.
[01:47:32.504 --> 01:47:33.605]  I said, did they inoculate you?
[01:47:33.625 --> 01:47:34.205]  And he's like, no.
[01:47:34.245 --> 01:47:38.706]  And I said, well, if it's just about the money, I said, you know, if you're not a patriot, go to Blackwater.
[01:47:38.746 --> 01:47:41.967]  They'll hire you for $100,000 a year if you don't give a shit about your country.
[01:47:42.287 --> 01:47:42.587]  Sorry.
[01:47:42.627 --> 01:47:43.867]  Yeah, I got to let you go.
[01:47:43.887 --> 01:47:44.808]  Hey, I understand, man.
[01:47:46.983 --> 01:47:47.964]  I'll let you go after that.
[01:47:48.964 --> 01:47:49.805]  I feel your sentiment.
[01:47:49.845 --> 01:47:52.026]  I'm glad you're a PrisonPlan.TV subscriber.
[01:47:52.046 --> 01:47:53.067]  I'm glad you dig the film.
[01:47:53.387 --> 01:47:54.608]  Hope you spread it out to your friends.
[01:47:55.028 --> 01:47:58.090]  Alright, let's go to Jay in North Carolina.
[01:47:58.150 --> 01:47:58.971]  Jay, what's the haps?
[01:47:59.811 --> 01:48:00.511]  Hey, Jason.
[01:48:00.972 --> 01:48:02.673]  I just wanted to make a couple of comments.
[01:48:03.173 --> 01:48:04.374]  A friend of mine just called me.
[01:48:04.414 --> 01:48:07.136]  I'm an over-the-road truck driver, and he just called me from
[01:48:08.376 --> 01:48:16.321]  from Washington and she just went to her local 4th of July parade and they had a 9-11 truth float in the parade.
[01:48:17.001 --> 01:48:17.962]  Oh, that is awesome!
[01:48:18.022 --> 01:48:18.602]  Where was this?
[01:48:19.823 --> 01:48:24.066]  It was in Tacoma Park, just a suburb of Washington, D.C.
[01:48:24.526 --> 01:48:27.207]  Now, I've been doing this since the one-year anniversary.
[01:48:27.267 --> 01:48:28.608]  I've been handing out information.
[01:48:28.628 --> 01:48:31.110]  I've handed out over 8,000 DVDs to people.
[01:48:33.371 --> 01:48:34.452]  We are winning, people.
[01:48:34.812 --> 01:48:37.554]  We are winning this fight and this
[01:48:38.638 --> 01:48:39.218]  We're good to go.
[01:49:01.215 --> 01:49:13.218]  Well, we hope that this movie is that, and we hope that this brings thousands of people to ground zero yet again this year, on the anniversary of 9-11, and just redoubles our efforts.
[01:49:13.539 --> 01:49:15.499]  We hope that it starts new chapters of We Are Change.
[01:49:15.699 --> 01:49:17.440]  We hope it starts other organizations.
[01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:20.581]  We hope it triples the activism in the next six months.
[01:49:20.601 --> 01:49:22.501]  I think that this movie can do that, Jay.
[01:49:23.301 --> 01:49:28.483]  Listen, Jason, about a month and a half ago, I drove through one of these Draw Your Blood checkpoints.
[01:49:29.827 --> 01:49:32.467]  Down in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
[01:49:32.487 --> 01:49:32.948]  Mm-hmm.
[01:49:33.848 --> 01:49:37.848]  And I was actually interviewed on a radio station for the whole hour about it.
[01:49:37.908 --> 01:49:39.809]  The whole situation was kind of weird.
[01:49:41.969 --> 01:49:45.710]  There was about 200 police on I-40.
[01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:49.530]  They had I-40 shut down both ways, just east of Albuquerque.
[01:49:49.550 --> 01:49:50.130]  Mm-hmm.
[01:49:50.911 --> 01:49:55.231]  And they had... It was a four-lane road at that point.
[01:49:55.251 --> 01:49:59.032]  They had three lanes with checkpoints and they had all semis left lane.
[01:49:59.468 --> 01:50:28.099]  Well, I got waved through this checkpoint, but as I was driving by it, I was looking at this scene, and they had, um, they had four, uh, three deep, four long checkpoints with three officers at each one to check your car as you drove up to it, um, and, and, um, and then just past that, they had a whole bunch of cops milling around, and then just past that, down the exit ramp, they had ten ambulances, all with their doors open and all with their lights on.
[01:50:29.361 --> 01:50:32.925]  And just past that, they had about 200 impounded cars.
[01:50:33.206 --> 01:50:33.486]  Wow.
[01:50:33.606 --> 01:50:37.571]  Alright, Jay, I gotta let you go, but it's a scary world we live in, when they're taking your blood.
[01:50:37.851 --> 01:50:41.736]  It's not freedom, folks, but it is the 4th of July, so let's declare our independence.
[01:50:42.256 --> 01:50:43.177]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:50:43.197 --> 01:50:44.239]  We'll be back after this.
[01:50:52.173 --> 01:50:56.378]  Would you like to know how you can use water as fuel and laugh at the rising price of gas?
[01:50:56.598 --> 01:50:58.560]  Then keep listening for a very special offer.
[01:50:58.741 --> 01:51:03.886]  GasFreedom.info has the information you need to learn about a simple technology you can have right now.

[01:51:43.824 --> 01:51:44.505]  A new world order.
[01:51:44.565 --> 01:51:45.045]  In the near future.
[01:51:56.937 --> 01:51:59.659]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:51:59.999 --> 01:52:02.141]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:52:02.821 --> 01:52:05.063]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:52:05.603 --> 01:52:08.045]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:52:08.806 --> 01:52:16.111]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:52:19.141 --> 01:52:24.104]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:52:24.585 --> 01:52:28.087]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:52:28.447 --> 01:52:30.949]  Bill of Rights makes great progress for the world government.
[01:52:31.029 --> 01:52:32.190]  Most people have no idea.
[01:52:32.210 --> 01:52:32.950]  They're not after money.
[01:52:32.970 --> 01:52:34.071]  They have all the money they need.
[01:52:34.251 --> 01:52:34.972]  They're after power.
[01:52:35.232 --> 01:52:36.052]  That's what they're after.
[01:52:36.393 --> 01:52:44.638]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:52:47.900 --> 01:52:49.001]  You have been warned.

[01:52:53.163 --> 01:52:55.244]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[01:52:55.484 --> 01:52:58.486]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[01:52:58.786 --> 01:53:05.269]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[01:53:05.670 --> 01:53:07.771]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.

[01:54:13.568 --> 01:54:17.492]  Said a joker to the thief.
[01:54:17.912 --> 01:54:19.714]  There's too much confusion.
[01:54:19.834 --> 01:54:24.559]  I can't get no relief.
[01:54:26.461 --> 01:54:29.404]  Been standing to drink my wine.
[01:54:38.142 --> 01:54:39.363]  Alright folks, we're back!
[01:54:39.563 --> 01:54:43.047]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:43.167 --> 01:54:44.088]  I'm Jason Berman.

[01:54:58.198 --> 01:55:02.099]  And we're going to have Bob Chapman on in the next hour, but I'm going to shoot through.
[01:55:02.179 --> 01:55:04.760]  I'm going to try to go through four calls, so we've got to make it quick, folks.
[01:55:05.580 --> 01:55:07.180]  Let's go to Archie in Portland.
[01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:07.801]  What's up, Archie?
[01:55:09.381 --> 01:55:09.901]  Hey, Jason.
[01:55:10.341 --> 01:55:10.921]  How you doing, man?
[01:55:11.702 --> 01:55:12.162]  I'm good.
[01:55:12.762 --> 01:55:13.762]  I will make it quick.
[01:55:14.422 --> 01:55:19.123]  I don't know if... I haven't seen Truth Rising, but I did see Loose Change Final Cut.
[01:55:19.143 --> 01:55:20.404]  I got it from my local library.
[01:55:20.644 --> 01:55:21.244]  Oh, awesome!
[01:55:21.707 --> 01:55:22.528]  Yeah, and it's really good.
[01:55:22.588 --> 01:55:27.611]  I like the way you guys, you know, sort of dropped some of the things that weren't approvable and tightened it up.
[01:55:27.731 --> 01:55:28.892]  Very good presentation.
[01:55:28.932 --> 01:55:33.055]  I can't imagine anyone watching it and not being convinced that it was an inside job.
[01:55:33.496 --> 01:55:41.942]  To that, I'm reading the 9-11 Commission report, and you guys may have covered this on Alex's show or in the blog or somewhere, but I haven't heard it.
[01:55:42.562 --> 01:55:44.183]  On page 320, paragraph 136, it says,
[01:55:46.929 --> 01:55:58.713]  At about 9.57, an EMS paramedic approached the FDNY Chief of Department and advised that an engineer in front of 7 WTC had just remarked that the Twin Towers, in fact, were in imminent danger of a total collapse.
[01:55:59.333 --> 01:56:00.273]  Who is this engineer?
[01:56:00.573 --> 01:56:01.554]  Who is the paramedic?
[01:56:02.254 --> 01:56:05.695]  And why, you know, I don't know if you guys have ever... No, that's a good question.
[01:56:06.075 --> 01:56:06.495]  I don't know.
[01:56:06.535 --> 01:56:11.677]  There's just so much disinfo about the times and what happened at 7, for instance,
[01:56:12.342 --> 01:56:29.174]  Uh, in that first FEMA report, they try to say that Barry Jennings and, uh, Michael Hess weren't in the building till after both planes had struck so that they can move the timeline over, uh, so that when they experience that explosion in Building 7, they say it's the collapse of the first tower.
[01:56:29.214 --> 01:56:34.718]  Well, the thing is that the collapse of the first tower didn't really cause all that much damage to the South Face of 7.
[01:56:35.299 --> 01:56:40.102]  We now have video of the South Face of 7, and there's barely any windows even blown out.
[01:56:40.142 --> 01:56:40.663]  You know what I mean?
[01:56:41.403 --> 01:56:44.406]  I saw that in the film.
[01:56:45.046 --> 01:56:47.669]  No one knew that they were going to come down, so how could there be an engineer?
[01:56:47.689 --> 01:56:50.411]  Well, someone did know, and it wasn't an engineer, my friend.
[01:56:50.451 --> 01:56:56.156]  Let me also point out the fact that Rudy Giuliani, who was in 7 in the morning, okay?
[01:56:56.176 --> 01:56:57.557]  That's why Michael Hess was there.
[01:56:58.038 --> 01:57:02.822]  He got moved out of there, and then he got moved to a command center on Barkley Street.
[01:57:03.102 --> 01:57:07.106]  He got on with Peter Jennings and said that he had gotten a warning from someone.
[01:57:07.146 --> 01:57:08.207]  Didn't say who it was.
[01:57:08.727 --> 01:57:19.412]  But then later, on I believe it was the 16th or 15th of September, he did an interview on 2020 with Barbara Walters, where he revealed that Dick Cheney had indeed given him a call that morning.
[01:57:19.592 --> 01:57:24.434]  He didn't say Dick Cheney warned him the towers were going to fall, but he did say that Dick Cheney did call him.
[01:57:24.474 --> 01:57:26.355]  Now remember, Cheney's in the PEOC.
[01:57:26.675 --> 01:57:30.137]  He's the guy that's, you know, neck deep in this Pentagon situation.
[01:57:30.437 --> 01:57:30.977]  He's also
[01:57:31.872 --> 01:57:36.033]  The guy who who basically probably was the most in the know that morning.
[01:57:36.153 --> 01:57:38.333]  He's the one that knew about Air Force One's threat.
[01:57:38.413 --> 01:57:39.614]  He had called the president there.
[01:57:39.854 --> 01:57:41.414]  He didn't warn anybody in the Pentagon.
[01:57:41.434 --> 01:57:42.634]  He allowed the Pentagon strike.
[01:57:43.054 --> 01:57:47.715]  I think Cheney was the middleman that got the insiders that weren't in the know out.
[01:57:47.875 --> 01:57:50.556]  I think he's the guy that was saying, hey, you need to get out of there.
[01:57:51.076 --> 01:57:52.416]  They're about to blow those buildings up.
[01:57:53.817 --> 01:57:55.037]  I mean, that's my personal opinion.
[01:57:56.843 --> 01:57:58.144]  Well, thank you very much.
[01:57:58.164 --> 01:57:58.824]  You got it, brother.
[01:57:59.004 --> 01:57:59.905]  Hey, thanks for the call, Archie.
[01:57:59.925 --> 01:58:01.585]  All right, let's jump to Fred in Philadelphia.
[01:58:02.006 --> 01:58:03.306]  All right, we're already at the bottom.
[01:58:03.726 --> 01:58:06.708]  If you guys hold over, we'll try to take some calls while Bob Chapman is in.
[01:58:07.108 --> 01:58:08.909]  Internationalforecaster.com.
[01:58:09.329 --> 01:58:12.171]  We're going to be talking about the skyrocketing prices of oil.
[01:58:13.471 --> 01:58:15.432]  You know, the fact the economy's in the dubs.
[01:58:15.672 --> 01:58:17.413]  We're almost on parity with the peso, folks.
[01:58:18.594 --> 01:58:19.674]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:58:19.714 --> 01:58:20.315]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:58:32.182 --> 01:58:35.544]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:35.584 --> 01:58:39.047]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:40.888 --> 01:58:42.910]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[01:58:43.030 --> 01:58:45.452]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:58:45.472 --> 01:58:47.713]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:58:47.753 --> 01:58:49.274]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:58:49.314 --> 01:58:50.935]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:58:50.995 --> 01:58:53.858]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:58:53.898 --> 01:58:59.822]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR, to send a hot shot?
[01:59:00.342 --> 01:59:06.872]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[01:59:07.173 --> 01:59:12.120]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:59:13.342 --> 01:59:14.423]  An inside job.
[01:59:15.845 --> 01:59:19.666]  How dare you?
[01:59:19.926 --> 01:59:23.347]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:59:23.367 --> 01:59:26.148]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:59:26.248 --> 01:59:32.690]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[01:59:43.348 --> 01:59:45.268]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:45.749 --> 01:59:48.629]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:53.590 --> 01:59:54.631]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:55.331 --> 01:59:56.431]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:57.091 --> 01:59:57.911]  You want answers?
[01:59:58.692 --> 01:59:59.572]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:59.592 --> 02:00:03.893]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:04.413 --> 02:00:08.474]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:09.972 --> 02:00:11.352]  All right, folks, we are back.
[02:00:11.752 --> 02:00:12.813]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:12.913 --> 02:00:21.175]  I am Jason Thermos, sitting in on this Independence Day, this Fourth of July, this Fireworks Friday, if you will.
[02:00:21.715 --> 02:00:22.735]  Very exciting stuff.
[02:00:22.815 --> 02:00:31.517]  And joining me now is Bob Chapman of the internationalforecaster.com in a time of great sorrow for this country.
[02:00:31.657 --> 02:00:34.378]  Our currency just continues to be devalued.
[02:00:34.438 --> 02:00:36.438]  Gas prices continue to shoot up.
[02:00:37.205 --> 02:00:44.908]  But even with all this, we still do have, you know, days like today where we are supposed to celebrate our independence, or what we have left of it.
[02:00:45.389 --> 02:00:48.110]  What do we have left of our independence, Mr. Chapman?
[02:00:48.130 --> 02:00:48.690]  What do you think?
[02:00:49.991 --> 02:00:55.273]  Well, I think very little, considering what eyewitnesses a young person in America.
[02:00:57.074 --> 02:01:00.555]  You know, the whole concept of freedom has been changed.
[02:01:01.475 --> 02:01:04.557]  We have laws today, the Patriot Act, among other things, that
[02:01:05.585 --> 02:01:11.811]  Uh, allow the government to, uh, ferret into our lives and find out things that they have no right to know.
[02:01:12.892 --> 02:01:20.220]  And, uh, also, these laws have a great controlling factor on people within our society.
[02:01:21.101 --> 02:01:23.423]  And, uh, it has also moved our government
[02:01:23.968 --> 02:01:37.998]  From what used to be a democratic republic, democracy if you may, into the hands of people who believe that we should have a corporatist, nationalist, socialist, fascist government.
[02:01:38.579 --> 02:01:41.221]  And that's what it's evolved into and that's what we've got.
[02:01:41.841 --> 02:01:52.309]  And people better get smart and realize it quickly because it's extremely dangerous to our freedom and everything else that we do in America.
[02:01:53.479 --> 02:01:54.160]  Absolutely.
[02:01:54.760 --> 02:02:04.926]  And days like today when we have a large audience, I really am hoping that when people go to their next barbecue, their family event, that this is on the table.
[02:02:04.966 --> 02:02:13.912]  That we're going to be talking about the fact that the country is in the dumps financially to get out of the dollar, to get into hard currency like silver and gold.
[02:02:14.833 --> 02:02:19.096]  And also to be aware that Barack Obama is not going to save you.
[02:02:19.176 --> 02:02:21.637]  John McCain and him pretty much play ball for the same folks.
[02:02:23.661 --> 02:02:38.446]  Until we become the government again, until we go out there and take the seats of power, a government formed by the people, until we go into our local communities and say, hey, I'm going to be the mayor, I'm going to be the city councilman, I'm going to be the governor, I'm going to be the congressman, I'm going to be the state senator.
[02:02:38.866 --> 02:02:44.047]  We're not going to change the system, you know, and that's why I'm enjoying what Ron Paul's doing with CampaignForLiberty.org.
[02:02:44.627 --> 02:02:46.988]  And I hope that this summer is a big awakening.
[02:02:47.028 --> 02:02:50.348]  That's why we released Truth Rising today on the 4th of July.
[02:02:50.608 --> 02:02:53.309]  I'm sure you haven't gotten a chance to see that yet, Bob, but we hope you do.
[02:02:53.689 --> 02:02:54.229]  Give it a look.
[02:02:54.989 --> 02:03:00.410]  And I hope we're motivated, because we have to be, because this is not going to be an easy task, is it?
[02:03:01.770 --> 02:03:06.051]  No, it certainly isn't, and it hasn't been for a long time, but I'll say this.
[02:03:06.724 --> 02:03:10.326]  That we've made great strides in informing people of what's going on.
[02:03:10.366 --> 02:03:15.369]  I remember in the early 60s, we were banging our heads against the wall.
[02:03:15.969 --> 02:03:28.016]  And guys like G. Edward Griffith and Gary Allen, who was my partner, and Alan Stang, you know, we did the best we could.
[02:03:28.036 --> 02:03:33.259]  But now, today, fortunately, we have a proliferation, but certainly not enough.
[02:03:33.737 --> 02:03:37.798]  Programs like this, telling people really the truth about what's going on.
[02:03:38.398 --> 02:03:47.620]  And the internet has revolutionized our ability to reach people and tell them the truth about what is going on behind the scenes.
[02:03:47.640 --> 02:03:49.380]  So, we are making strides.
[02:03:49.600 --> 02:04:02.363]  And I think that the opposition, which is the Illuminati, which you know in more nominal terms is the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderberger Group,
[02:04:05.157 --> 02:04:05.957]  They're on the run.
[02:04:06.117 --> 02:04:10.120]  I mean, you may not think so, but they've got some serious problems.
[02:04:10.581 --> 02:04:24.211]  I mean, everything they've done in the Middle East has gone upside down for them, and now they were not able to stop the financial and economic carnage that they began some five years ago, and now they're in a real pickle.
[02:04:25.496 --> 02:04:26.056]  Absolutely.
[02:04:26.136 --> 02:04:32.560]  And there are no easy solutions, although I do want to discuss solutions for the regular people out there, for the viewers.
[02:04:33.061 --> 02:04:39.064]  And I also want to discuss the fact that Mexico's currency isn't that far behind us anymore.
[02:04:39.104 --> 02:04:40.025]  We're really close.
[02:04:40.065 --> 02:04:41.105]  I think it's something like 5 to 1.
[02:04:41.185 --> 02:04:42.366]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:04:42.646 --> 02:04:43.587]  We'll be back after this.

[02:07:56.326 --> 02:07:57.508]  All right, folks, we are back.
[02:07:57.548 --> 02:07:58.709]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:07:58.809 --> 02:07:59.750]  I am Jason Bermas.
[02:08:00.291 --> 02:08:03.955]  With me is Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:08:03.995 --> 02:08:06.498]  I want to remind everybody, Truth Rising has dropped.
[02:08:06.558 --> 02:08:11.784]  It's over at PrisonPlanet.tv in the highest of qualities, almost DVD quality, folks.
[02:08:11.864 --> 02:08:12.405]  It's really
[02:08:13.065 --> 02:08:14.966]  Just about as close to a DVD as you're gonna get.
[02:08:14.986 --> 02:08:16.646]  You can get it, you can burn it to disk.
[02:08:17.107 --> 02:08:20.168]  And if you got the DivX DVD player, you can watch it on your big screen.
[02:08:20.188 --> 02:08:21.308]  It's very exciting times.
[02:08:21.688 --> 02:08:24.149]  So go to PrisonPlanet.tv and grab a membership.
[02:08:24.469 --> 02:08:25.970]  It's 15 cents a day.
[02:08:26.330 --> 02:08:30.952]  Now before we left, Mr. Chabon, I was discussing how the dollar has just plunged.
[02:08:31.012 --> 02:08:34.353]  We now have Canadian currency, which is actually above the dollar.
[02:08:34.373 --> 02:08:37.394]  I was actually in the mall a week ago and I had some Canadian
[02:08:37.754 --> 02:08:40.355]  Well, first of all, we have seen the Canadian dollar go to $1.15 several months ago.
[02:09:04.128 --> 02:09:06.069]  And it's backed off.
[02:09:06.269 --> 02:09:13.473]  It closed here on Thursday at $98.20.
[02:09:14.054 --> 02:09:20.177]  So right now it's worth a little bit less than the dollar, a tenth of a cent less.
[02:09:21.718 --> 02:09:29.862]  And that is in part because, as you know, Canada is a natural resource producer, a big one.
[02:09:31.023 --> 02:09:32.284]  That's because it
[02:09:33.570 --> 02:09:40.273]  Is the Bank of Canada and the Canadian government don't want that currency going higher.
[02:09:41.013 --> 02:09:55.000]  And the reason why is they find it difficult to compete under free trade and World Trade Organization rules, especially for manufacturing in Ontario and Quebec.
[02:09:56.240 --> 02:10:00.182]  And so I don't expect the Canadian dollar to run away against the U.S.
[02:10:00.202 --> 02:10:01.643]  dollar because the manipulation
[02:10:02.133 --> 02:10:06.455]  By their central bank and the policies of the present Canadian government.
[02:10:07.896 --> 02:10:15.780]  As far as the Mexican peso is concerned, the peso recently hit a high of 10.27.
[02:10:17.081 --> 02:10:19.562]  And you're probably wondering how I know all these things.
[02:10:20.402 --> 02:10:22.823]  I watch him like a hawk and have for years and years.
[02:10:22.904 --> 02:10:26.445]  In fact, to my subscribers, I predicted the
[02:10:30.416 --> 02:10:43.026]  Mexican peso used to be pegged to the dollar one for one and I predicted it would go to $3.25 to a dollar and most people thought I was mad and of course that happened and look where it is today.
[02:10:44.087 --> 02:10:46.389]  But anyway, back to the price of the peso.
[02:10:46.849 --> 02:10:56.057]  It wasn't too long ago, several months ago, that the peso was $11.3 to the dollar which means it was much weaker than it is now and presently
[02:10:57.588 --> 02:11:09.774]  The peso yesterday morning was $10.34, $10.37, and I'm sure that in part is because the Mexican government stepped in and made it a little cheaper.
[02:11:12.736 --> 02:11:20.100]  The Bank of Mexico raised interest rates not too long ago because of inflation, which they say is running close to 5%.
[02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:24.462]  And that's probably so, and it's probably even higher than that.
[02:11:25.185 --> 02:11:35.171]  But the appreciation of the Mexican peso against the dollar over the past, let's say, four months has been about 10%.
[02:11:36.212 --> 02:11:37.093]  Highly unusual.
[02:11:38.013 --> 02:11:39.414]  That's because the U.S.
[02:11:39.494 --> 02:11:45.278]  problem with their balance of payments deficit is greater than that of Mexico.
[02:11:46.078 --> 02:11:53.623]  Mexico, in the last 10 years in particular, have really cleaned up their financial act, so to speak.
[02:11:54.232 --> 02:11:58.435]  And they're in much better condition than they were previously, historically.
[02:11:58.955 --> 02:12:09.683]  But Mexico's main problem is not a diminuting tax coming, a revenue coming from diminishing oil production.
[02:12:09.823 --> 02:12:14.706]  It's from the wealthy in Mexico who control 85% of the wealth.
[02:12:15.446 --> 02:12:20.930]  And they hold most of their wealth offshore, off from the country of Mexico.
[02:12:21.350 --> 02:12:23.512]  And they do that so they don't have to pay taxes on it.
[02:12:24.321 --> 02:12:35.831]  And unless that money starts to get retrieved so that it can be invested in Mexico, their problems are never going to get solved because you need a strong educational process.
[02:12:36.651 --> 02:12:39.554]  And education is not free in Mexico.
[02:12:40.374 --> 02:12:42.857]  And it's expensive for poor people.
[02:12:42.917 --> 02:12:50.263]  It costs $200 a year for a little boy or a little girl to go to the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th grade into high school.
[02:12:50.976 --> 02:13:01.125]  And when you've got a daddy who's a policeman who's making $500 a month, that $200 is a lot of money.
[02:13:02.426 --> 02:13:04.148]  And so that has to stop.
[02:13:04.168 --> 02:13:06.470]  There has to be real free education in Mexico.
[02:13:07.210 --> 02:13:18.020]  And those jobs have got to be created so the people who have illegally gone to America will want to go home so that they can be with their own people and their own culture and make a decent living.
[02:13:19.361 --> 02:13:30.126]  Absolutely, but you know, that's what is so worrisome to me is that, you know, our country is going to be merging with Mexico and Canada through the SPP, through NAFTA, through CAFTA.
[02:13:30.586 --> 02:13:42.731]  You know, I don't know exactly when this is going to happen or how long it's going to take, but I would hate to see the standard of living be dropped to that of, oh my God, we need to pay such and such so our kids get a middle school or a high school education.
[02:13:42.771 --> 02:13:44.912]  It sounds like insanity to me.
[02:13:46.033 --> 02:13:48.714]  Well, I can guarantee you, Jason, it will happen.
[02:13:49.830 --> 02:13:52.511]  If we have an amalgamation of those three countries.
[02:13:53.351 --> 02:14:00.213]  And that is another method of bringing those countries financially and economically to their knees.
[02:14:00.353 --> 02:14:01.933]  Particularly the United States and Canada.
[02:14:02.473 --> 02:14:05.574]  So that they can't argue about the implantation of world government.
[02:14:06.134 --> 02:14:11.736]  And I think that the North American Union is a long ways away.
[02:14:12.376 --> 02:14:14.497]  And I think the Amaro is a long ways away.
[02:14:15.497 --> 02:14:19.058]  And we're hearing noises out of Mexico right now.
[02:14:19.659 --> 02:14:27.324]  That they're starting to realize what it is, especially in the Senate and in the Assembly.
[02:14:28.085 --> 02:14:31.848]  And I think it's going to be a pretty cold day that that happens.
[02:14:32.608 --> 02:14:36.791]  And so I don't see any of that, at least within the next five years.
[02:14:37.071 --> 02:14:42.956]  But don't you think that the Mexicans, especially their government, their officials, their elite, are going to be pushing for this?
[02:14:43.016 --> 02:14:44.717]  Because like you just said, you know,
[02:14:45.865 --> 02:15:02.734]  You know, 90% of the country is run by about, what, 5 or 10% of the people, and this is only going to benefit them even further in trade, and they'll, you know, they'll sell it to the commoners in Mexico as, look, you know, we're going to become part of the United States, paved roads everywhere, you know, malls, everything we've ever dreamed of.
[02:15:02.754 --> 02:15:03.934]  They've already got all that.
[02:15:05.095 --> 02:15:12.459]  But don't you feel like... I mean, you go to Mexico City and Guadalajara and Monterrey, and you go down the street and
[02:15:12.961 --> 02:15:24.070]  And over there is Walmart, and next door is Sam's, and down the street, a hundred yards away is Costco, and up the way is Liverpool, which is the equivalent of Nordstrom's.
[02:15:24.751 --> 02:15:26.753]  And you've already got all that there.
[02:15:27.473 --> 02:15:31.336]  And you've got toll highways, yes, but you've got highways, and they're good ones.
[02:15:31.957 --> 02:15:32.157]  No.
[02:15:32.718 --> 02:15:40.204]  The problem in Mexico is the formation of industry and services, the brainpower is there,
[02:15:41.187 --> 02:15:42.228]  That's what's good.
[02:15:42.268 --> 02:15:44.470]  The investments have to be made financially.
[02:15:44.910 --> 02:15:48.392]  And number two, the educational system has to be made free.
[02:15:49.173 --> 02:15:58.220]  And, you know, the labor unions are not helping, because in order to compete with China and India, they're lowering wages.
[02:15:58.360 --> 02:16:00.041]  I mean, they're bad enough as they are.
[02:16:00.882 --> 02:16:04.765]  And so, Mexico has great potential.
[02:16:05.345 --> 02:16:09.368]  It's just that the money has to be brought into place to do it.
[02:16:09.898 --> 02:16:22.929]  And I want to tell you this, that the Assembly and the Senate in Mexico is going to be very, very hard to convince them to join the North American Union.
[02:16:23.629 --> 02:16:34.098]  And they're fighting right now with the administration, which is run by Pan and the two, the Assembly and the Senate is run by PRD.
[02:16:34.939 --> 02:16:37.741]  And they've got a battle going on because
[02:16:38.467 --> 02:16:45.012]  Calderon, who's the president, wants to denationalize the oil industry.
[02:16:45.713 --> 02:16:48.435]  And he can't even get that accomplished.
[02:16:48.956 --> 02:16:51.037]  So North American Union is a long ways away.
[02:16:51.798 --> 02:16:53.940]  Well, now that you brought up oil, let's get into it.
[02:16:53.980 --> 02:16:57.222]  I mean, higher gas prices than ever everywhere I go.
[02:16:57.302 --> 02:17:00.525]  I mean, right here in Texas, it's about $4 a gallon for regular.
[02:17:00.565 --> 02:17:02.787]  I was down in New York, like I said, last week, and it's
[02:17:03.427 --> 02:17:06.409]  God, I wasn't even in the city and it was like $4.50 for regular.
[02:17:07.090 --> 02:17:11.953]  Are we going to see a cap on these guys' gas prices or are we going to be paying like $6 a gallon by the end of the summer?
[02:17:12.574 --> 02:17:14.915]  Well, let's go to the reasons.
[02:17:14.975 --> 02:17:17.317]  Number one, there's more demand than supply.
[02:17:18.098 --> 02:17:19.198]  And it's as simple as that.
[02:17:19.319 --> 02:17:23.402]  In the United States, yes, they've cut back 2, 3, 4 percent.
[02:17:23.882 --> 02:17:27.184]  Depending upon where you look in gasoline consumption, that's going to continue.
[02:17:28.005 --> 02:17:30.827]  But you've got places like India and China that are expanding.
[02:17:31.505 --> 02:17:33.166]  And so the demand is there.
[02:17:33.787 --> 02:17:36.989]  So we have more demand than supply, and that's why prices are high.
[02:17:37.689 --> 02:17:39.090]  Yes, we have speculation.
[02:17:40.251 --> 02:17:46.155]  Anywhere between 20 and 35% of the market in all commodities is speculation, and that's good.
[02:17:47.336 --> 02:18:00.625]  Because there's somebody out there who's willing at some price to take delivery, or at least say that they're going to take delivery of 100,000 barrels of oil, or a million bushels of corn, or whatever it is.
[02:18:01.860 --> 02:18:29.495]  What's making the prices go up is two things, but one in particular, and that is the Fed Reserve supplying the money to the financial system so that they can go and create excessive speculation in the commodity markets because they are no longer making money, which they were making two-thirds of their income, from packaging mortgages into bonds that weren't worth the paper they were written on.
[02:18:30.936 --> 02:18:31.236]  And so
[02:18:32.136 --> 02:18:45.340]  The speculation that's happening among banks, investment banks, brokerage houses, in the energy sector, is what has driven prices to the levels that they're at.
[02:18:45.840 --> 02:18:47.360]  Where should oil be selling for?
[02:18:48.300 --> 02:18:52.942]  I think a fair price today, considering demand, would be about $80 a barrel.
[02:18:52.962 --> 02:18:53.402]  It's around $140.
[02:18:54.462 --> 02:18:55.162]  It shouldn't be there.
[02:18:58.675 --> 02:19:00.975]  And it's probably going to go higher over the short term.
[02:19:01.536 --> 02:19:02.316]  Natural gas, $13.50.
[02:19:03.276 --> 02:19:08.077]  Actually $13.60 a BCF.
[02:19:08.557 --> 02:19:09.797]  It'll probably move up to $14.50.
[02:19:10.417 --> 02:19:13.158]  It could caterbilt to pound at $20.
[02:19:14.118 --> 02:19:15.518]  Oil could go to $1.70.
[02:19:16.539 --> 02:19:18.939]  Gasoline could go up another $0.50 a gallon.
[02:19:20.259 --> 02:19:21.580]  And so it's not going to go away.
[02:19:22.160 --> 02:19:23.520]  But those are the reasons why.
[02:19:24.160 --> 02:19:28.301]  As far as the high prices for food, the real culprit is ethanol.
[02:19:29.797 --> 02:19:35.522]  Taking down about one third of the corn that we're producing, and that, you know, what would you rather have?
[02:19:35.542 --> 02:19:37.343]  Cheap gasoline or no food?
[02:19:37.543 --> 02:19:43.248]  Alright, let's get into ethanol on the other side of the Alex Jones Show, PrisonPlanet.tv, the 9-11 Chronicles, Truth Rising.
[02:19:48.191 --> 02:19:55.177]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero, and we knew what to do.
[02:19:56.007 --> 02:19:56.988]  At least we thought we did.
[02:19:57.208 --> 02:20:03.611]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[02:20:04.251 --> 02:20:10.975]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air
[02:20:11.667 --> 02:20:12.788]  We're safe to breathe.
[02:20:13.149 --> 02:20:19.957]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[02:20:20.257 --> 02:20:23.300]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[02:20:23.421 --> 02:20:28.546]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[02:20:29.187 --> 02:20:31.808]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[02:20:32.249 --> 02:20:38.112]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[02:20:38.312 --> 02:20:40.853]  Or order the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:20:41.233 --> 02:20:46.176]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[02:20:47.489 --> 02:20:47.929]  Gold.
[02:20:48.289 --> 02:20:49.570]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:20:49.830 --> 02:20:55.912]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:20:56.092 --> 02:20:59.933]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:21:00.273 --> 02:21:02.154]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:21:02.214 --> 02:21:04.495]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:21:04.635 --> 02:21:11.317]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker
[02:21:11.357 --> 02:21:11.857]  We're good to go.
[02:21:40.886 --> 02:21:42.407]  You must read this report.
[02:21:42.527 --> 02:21:44.248]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[02:21:47.209 --> 02:21:47.810]  Question.
[02:21:48.050 --> 02:21:52.592]  Is the world getting better or vastly worse?
[02:21:52.732 --> 02:21:56.874]  The world economic collapse could come any day.
[02:21:57.255 --> 02:21:57.795]  Question.
[02:21:58.115 --> 02:22:01.657]  Are you prepared or are you ignoring the signs?
[02:22:03.378 --> 02:22:03.958]  Question.

[02:24:20.290 --> 02:24:24.572]  All you people out there gearing up for big barbecues and big firework displays, remember,
[02:24:25.310 --> 02:24:36.253]  There's no day like the present to spread the truth, and, uh, that's why we like you to share this radio show, get the podcast, get our films, burn them to disk, hand them out, hold screenings, all that good stuff.
[02:24:36.273 --> 02:24:41.415]  We're gonna be talking about a lot more of that with Luke Rudowsky in the final hour and what's going on in New York City.
[02:24:42.475 --> 02:24:49.298]  On the September 11th anniversary this year, but right now we're with, uh, Bob Chapman, and you were getting into ethanol at the end.
[02:24:49.858 --> 02:24:53.779]  And, uh, you know, Alex thinks that the ethanol thing is a, a total and complete scam,
[02:24:54.312 --> 02:24:57.092]  It's phony environmentalism, and it's harmful, isn't it, Bob?
[02:24:58.253 --> 02:25:00.593]  It is, and Alex is absolutely right.
[02:25:01.393 --> 02:25:03.934]  Like he is about almost everything.
[02:25:05.014 --> 02:25:11.515]  And we're glad we have Alex on the air, and he's young and he's vibrant, and I'm old and I can't do it anymore.
[02:25:11.995 --> 02:25:15.636]  But anyway, it is a scam.
[02:25:17.136 --> 02:25:23.117]  And 85% of ethanol is created by Archer Daniels Midland, and
[02:25:24.225 --> 02:25:29.629]  Archie Daniels Midland is a top group.
[02:25:30.770 --> 02:25:38.296]  The owners of the company are Bilderbergers and CFR and Trilateralists, etc.
[02:25:39.136 --> 02:25:47.803]  And of course you've got your hangarons, ex-politicians like Tom Daschle and Bob Dole.
[02:25:49.184 --> 02:25:52.026]  Daschle's from South Dakota and Dole's from Kansas.
[02:25:52.879 --> 02:25:56.780]  And they produce great amounts of corn, so they're all for that.
[02:25:57.460 --> 02:26:12.484]  And then you have Barack Obama, who got caught getting cheap flights at subsidized rates in corporate jets, owned by ADM, which is the symbol for Archie Daniels Midland, back in 2004, and Obama's
[02:26:17.868 --> 02:26:29.154]  Uh, advisor on energy and environmental issues is Jason Bromant, uh, who was on the National Commission of the Energy Apology associated with, uh, uh, ethanol.
[02:26:29.234 --> 02:26:36.618]  So, you know, if Mr. Obama's elected, uh, then, uh, ethanol's not going to, uh, be curtailed.
[02:26:37.238 --> 02:26:38.979]  And the same thing with Mr. McCain.
[02:26:38.999 --> 02:26:41.960]  Uh, he has all those ghosts in his closet as well.
[02:26:42.881 --> 02:26:46.603]  And so, um, we're not gonna get any relief if, uh,
[02:26:47.333 --> 02:26:49.954]  These people are elected presidents.
[02:26:50.454 --> 02:26:58.376]  And about one-third of the corn in the country goes for that in production, created into ethanol.
[02:26:58.416 --> 02:27:06.218]  And of course, it does injure the engine, particularly the gaskets, which hold the engine together.
[02:27:06.998 --> 02:27:10.179]  And in time, you have to have more repairs.
[02:27:10.419 --> 02:27:16.341]  And of course, there's a subsidy that goes with ethanol, which is ridiculous.
[02:27:17.233 --> 02:27:19.155]  And it's a whole thing is a scam.
[02:27:19.735 --> 02:27:28.623]  And it's creating higher food prices because corn is being farmed, which is going into ethanol that wouldn't be otherwise.
[02:27:28.703 --> 02:27:36.149]  And then the farmers are not growing wheat or soybeans or something else that would have gone into the system because they're growing corn.
[02:27:36.870 --> 02:27:44.436]  And so the United States and Europe in particular agreed
[02:27:45.916 --> 02:27:55.139]  All the experts agreed at the meeting in Lima, Peru about a month ago that ethanol should stop production, but they didn't pass any initiatives on it.
[02:27:55.599 --> 02:28:11.723]  They wouldn't do anything about it, and the reason why is that the Illuminists don't want that to happen, because Archer Daniels Midland is making lots of money, and people in the third world are dying, and they're useless eaters, and the Illuminists want to get rid of them.
[02:28:12.575 --> 02:28:13.196]  Absolutely.
[02:28:13.236 --> 02:28:17.081]  I mean, it really is about population control and the consolidation of power.
[02:28:17.481 --> 02:28:24.030]  Meanwhile, they sell the public on this green movement, you know, saying, oh, we need to go green, we need to go green.
[02:28:24.290 --> 02:28:27.454]  They have commercials now where Al Sharpton and Pat Robertson
[02:28:27.813 --> 02:28:28.393]  Well, they don't get it.
[02:28:54.335 --> 02:28:57.818]  They don't understand the psycho-political aspect of what's going on.
[02:28:59.059 --> 02:29:00.440]  It takes a long time.
[02:29:01.500 --> 02:29:10.827]  It takes a lot of research to really get into the Illuminist heads, to find out what they're doing, how they're doing it, and where they're headed.
[02:29:11.448 --> 02:29:19.754]  And you have to start off by re-ratcheting your mind and thinking like a full-term, all-out criminal.
[02:29:21.144 --> 02:29:21.925]  Well, that's what they are.
[02:29:21.965 --> 02:29:23.867]  They're absolute maniacal criminals.
[02:29:24.387 --> 02:29:28.391]  And they get their just desserts in 9-11 Chronicles Truth Rising.
[02:29:28.451 --> 02:29:35.718]  Watch as the global elite and their minions are confronted by the power of free speech right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:33:28.332 --> 02:33:29.173]  That's right, folks.
[02:33:31.314 --> 02:33:37.018]  Despite what the BBC is gonna tell you in a couple days, 9-11 was an inside job.
[02:33:38.799 --> 02:33:40.681]  They're gonna put out some junk science,
[02:33:42.702 --> 02:33:58.566]  Some nonsensical propaganda piece on how Building 7 fell from fire and damage, and the news just happened to have the foresight to report that same very fact before the building had even collapsed, yet it took almost seven years for a report on the matter.
[02:33:58.666 --> 02:33:59.846]  It's absolutely ludicrous.
[02:34:00.246 --> 02:34:01.967]  The BBC, you continue to sicken me.
[02:34:03.307 --> 02:34:10.049]  But before we go back to Bob Chapman, I was just sent this link by Aaron Dykes, and it is an
[02:34:10.959 --> 02:34:18.606]  A speech by Kucinich on July 4th, telling how patriotic it is actually to impeach the President.
[02:34:18.646 --> 02:34:24.531]  We talked about Dennis in the first segment, one of the real patriots of the year outside of Ron Paul.
[02:34:24.591 --> 02:34:26.873]  Dennis Kucinich has done so much for this movement.
[02:34:27.514 --> 02:34:35.220]  And, you know, those 35 articles on the House floor, the last three, the last three of which, including 9-11, is just an amazing step.
[02:34:35.261 --> 02:34:38.043]  So without further ado, let's play this little clip.
[02:34:39.468 --> 02:34:41.749]  Democratic leaders say impeachment's off the table.
[02:34:43.009 --> 02:34:55.352]  So let's set a new table for our nation, upon which we place the Constitution and where we demand that all those who've taken an oath to defend it keep their promise and protect our nation from the threat within.
[02:34:56.732 --> 02:35:00.713]  Please go to Kucinich.us now and sign the petition which calls for impeachment.
[02:35:01.574 --> 02:35:07.255]  This is the one petition that will make a difference because I will be personally delivering it to your member of Congress.
[02:35:08.217 --> 02:35:11.998]  Please circulate word of this petition far and wide to all your friends and family.
[02:35:12.578 --> 02:35:20.181]  This is the one opportunity we have right now to actually change events in this country.
[02:35:20.201 --> 02:35:23.622]  232 years ago, our nation was conceived in liberty.
[02:35:24.803 --> 02:35:37.727]  We have once again reached a moment of truth, one that Lincoln recognized at Gettysburg, as to whether this nation or any nation so conceived or so dedicated can long endure.
[02:35:39.548 --> 02:35:55.400]  Through the ashes of the Civil War, Lincoln prayed that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, and for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
[02:35:57.081 --> 02:36:08.910]  This 4th of July, 2008, we face a different kind of war, one which is trying our souls, a war based on lies, but with the power of truth.
[02:36:10.367 --> 02:36:11.188]  The power of the people.
[02:36:12.449 --> 02:36:14.451]  We can achieve a new birth of freedom.
[02:36:15.792 --> 02:36:17.613]  Standing up for what is good in America.
[02:36:18.995 --> 02:36:20.796]  Insisting on the rule of law.
[02:36:22.157 --> 02:36:25.040]  Demanding adherence to the Constitution.
[02:36:26.601 --> 02:36:33.147]  And supporting the impeachment of a president who lied to take us into a war against Iraq.
[02:36:34.929 --> 02:36:36.350]  Be the answer to Lincoln's prayer.
[02:36:37.734 --> 02:36:41.877]  Please pledge your support now to restoring the rule of law in America.
[02:36:43.538 --> 02:36:58.150]  As we once again celebrate Independence Day, let us celebrate freedom from fear and pledge that this government of the people will survive in this land that we love.
[02:36:59.831 --> 02:37:01.632]  Please go to KASINIC.US now.
[02:37:03.314 --> 02:37:06.416]  This is your opportunity to make a difference.
[02:37:07.873 --> 02:37:10.114]  Truly celebrate Independence Day.
[02:37:11.395 --> 02:37:13.956]  Thank you, and happy 4th of July.
[02:37:15.396 --> 02:37:16.357]  Go Dennis Kucinich!
[02:37:16.417 --> 02:37:23.800]  It's kucinich.us with one C key, or um, K-U-C-I-N-I-C-H dot U-S, and I want you to sign that petition.
[02:37:23.840 --> 02:37:26.281]  I want these articles of impeachment to move forward.
[02:37:27.582 --> 02:37:29.642]  And this, this is the guy giving us the opportunity.
[02:37:29.662 --> 02:37:31.203]  What did you just think about that speech, Bob?
[02:37:31.223 --> 02:37:35.465]  I thought it was terrific, and I, you know, what's good about all this
[02:37:37.185 --> 02:38:06.461]  Because of the evil that's been committed is that we have people like Ron Paul and Dennis who come from very different parts of the political spectrum coming together with many similar ideas and how to extricate America from this terrible morass that it's in and bringing the left and the right together so to speak is a wonderful accomplishment because that makes us all really one people
[02:38:07.276 --> 02:38:09.537]  Who are not at odds with one another.
[02:38:09.557 --> 02:38:12.819]  We're always going to have disagreements, and that's okay.
[02:38:13.319 --> 02:38:33.751]  But this participation of conservatives and liberals and people from all walks of political life in endeavors now to go forward and cleanse our country of people like the President of the United States, legally, is a wonderful action.
[02:38:35.940 --> 02:38:46.043]  It really is, and Dennis is leading the way, and I like how he started off saying, you know, if it's off the table for Democratic leaders, then let's put it on the table for a new party.
[02:38:46.123 --> 02:38:51.024]  I mean, Nancy Pelosi and AIPAC went into his office and tried to extort Consention.
[02:38:51.044 --> 02:38:53.444]  He threw them out before these articles were released.
[02:38:53.744 --> 02:38:55.645]  He's now looking for the support of the people.
[02:38:56.503 --> 02:38:58.004]  We need to give him that support.
[02:38:58.484 --> 02:39:00.766]  We need to make it known that this is what we want.
[02:39:01.226 --> 02:39:06.649]  That this is really a last-ditch effort to bring these tyrants to some sort of justice.
[02:39:06.930 --> 02:39:08.631]  For some sort of transparency.
[02:39:08.931 --> 02:39:13.514]  So that more can be revealed on how criminal this organization has truly been.
[02:39:13.534 --> 02:39:14.794]  That's what this administration is.
[02:39:15.055 --> 02:39:17.016]  It is a criminal organization.
[02:39:17.756 --> 02:39:18.617]  That's one of the other things.
[02:39:18.677 --> 02:39:19.818]  Bush does not run the show.
[02:39:20.598 --> 02:39:23.720]  That's right, and I think we can all help ourselves by clearing Congress.
[02:39:49.722 --> 02:39:53.806]  Vote them all out of office, except Dennis and Ron, and just get rid of them.
[02:39:54.346 --> 02:40:08.098]  And at least it'll give us a year of breathing room before those who are compromised get compromised, and those who are willing to get on the payroll of the Illuminists get on there.
[02:40:08.759 --> 02:40:11.141]  So we have a window of opportunity here.
[02:40:11.822 --> 02:40:13.363]  Don't let it slip through our hands.
[02:40:13.823 --> 02:40:15.785]  Fortunately, there's some 45 or 50
[02:40:17.641 --> 02:40:20.642]  Congressmen and Senators who are not running for re-election.
[02:40:20.702 --> 02:40:27.783]  So that gives us at least a partial piece of help in getting these people out.
[02:40:29.044 --> 02:40:33.044]  It's people we don't have to continue with which were there before.
[02:40:33.665 --> 02:40:38.346]  But Nancy Pelosi is a person that we really don't want there anymore.
[02:40:38.866 --> 02:40:44.487]  And so all of you people in her district, please give that some thought.
[02:40:45.615 --> 02:40:46.095]  Absolutely.
[02:40:46.135 --> 02:40:52.436]  Well, one of the things that people don't understand is that Pelosi was part of the initial congressional investigation into 9-11.
[02:40:52.737 --> 02:40:58.518]  She was the lead Democrat, so that whole investigation was a total cover-up.
[02:40:58.738 --> 02:41:01.778]  They actually redacted 27 pages in that report.
[02:41:01.818 --> 02:41:05.059]  It still hasn't been released, and it was a whitewash anyway.
[02:41:05.499 --> 02:41:14.061]  I'm sure those 27 pages probably have to do with foreign government funding of the hijackers and possibly help on the inside from those foreign governments.
[02:41:14.421 --> 02:41:18.647]  And that won't come to light according to Bob Graham for another, you know, 15 or 20 years.
[02:41:18.687 --> 02:41:20.950]  He said 20 to 30 years in 2002.
[02:41:21.531 --> 02:41:24.134]  But she was in on the cover-up from the beginning.
[02:41:24.214 --> 02:41:31.124]  She's not our friend and we should not celebrate, you know, that she... I mean a lot of people invested in the 2006 elections thinking,
[02:41:32.185 --> 02:41:32.705]  Well, it's gotta happen.
[02:41:32.765 --> 02:41:34.946]  That's why we're on the radio almost every day, and that's why we're writing.
[02:42:01.693 --> 02:42:10.044]  And thank God for the Internet, and we just gotta keep on doing it until we can't do it anymore.
[02:42:10.705 --> 02:42:11.245]  Absolutely.
[02:42:11.526 --> 02:42:14.369]  Listen, I had a question from one of the callers earlier today.
[02:42:14.409 --> 02:42:15.431]  They were asking me
[02:42:16.363 --> 02:42:17.104]  I don't know.
[02:42:38.312 --> 02:42:43.674]  I'm not going to speed on that, and he may be right, but I can't answer that because I don't know.
[02:42:43.934 --> 02:42:46.715]  Yeah, no, I didn't know either, and I thought that you might be the guy to ask.
[02:42:46.995 --> 02:42:55.337]  He was basically saying that the federal government doesn't have jurisdiction to put this out unless it was in gold or silver, and he was wondering if he could put out a class action lawsuit.
[02:42:55.357 --> 02:43:00.479]  I guess if you're still listening, you know, go to Google, go to another source, because we just don't know.
[02:43:00.859 --> 02:43:04.420]  But I mean, that's another thing, this $600 that everybody's going to get back.
[02:43:05.561 --> 02:43:12.108]  The majority of the people out there, unfortunately, that aren't expecting this, this is going to be a little treat for them.
[02:43:12.128 --> 02:43:13.529]  They're not going to use it for anything useful.
[02:43:13.589 --> 02:43:19.075]  It's going to be a new PlayStation 3, or a new Wii, or maybe a car payment.
[02:43:20.116 --> 02:43:26.203]  It's really going to be frivolous stuff, and you don't believe the $600 is going to stimulate the economy, do you, Bob?
[02:43:27.336 --> 02:43:30.077]  No, and I think it's more psychological than anything else.
[02:43:30.998 --> 02:43:37.081]  When we see the final figures, I think you'll find two-thirds of it went towards paying back payments and something.
[02:43:38.141 --> 02:43:39.982]  And probably mostly credit cards.
[02:43:40.842 --> 02:43:42.763]  And all of the checks haven't been released.
[02:43:42.823 --> 02:43:43.644]  A part of them have.
[02:43:44.164 --> 02:43:45.564]  And part of them have got to go.
[02:43:46.065 --> 02:43:48.446]  But Congress is talking about doing it again.
[02:43:50.287 --> 02:43:52.208]  And maybe they will.
[02:43:52.828 --> 02:43:55.349]  They're talking about extending unemployment.
[02:43:56.187 --> 02:44:00.088]  And in this kind of environment, I quite frankly think that's a good idea.
[02:44:01.188 --> 02:44:12.411]  And I'm not for socialistic measures, but when people see the lies that we have received in regard to unemployment figures.
[02:44:13.051 --> 02:44:14.171]  A true unemployment is 14%.
[02:44:15.051 --> 02:44:18.152]  That includes all the long-terms and everything else.
[02:44:19.392 --> 02:44:22.533]  If you take and leave the long-terms out, it's 9.7%.
[02:44:25.130 --> 02:44:27.591]  Uh, and those are the discouraged and people like that.
[02:44:27.671 --> 02:44:34.873]  And if you drop down to what the figures they give to the American public of 5.5%, those are only the current people.
[02:44:35.693 --> 02:44:43.636]  And besides, we've lost millions and millions of jobs, uh, over the last several years to free trade globalization, offshoring, and outsourcing.
[02:44:44.409 --> 02:44:46.751]  And it's driven wages down as well.
[02:44:47.371 --> 02:44:51.374]  And then you have the illegal alien factor, which has helped drive those wages down as well.
[02:44:52.075 --> 02:44:59.880]  And so the American public is in tough shape, and it's going to get tougher because unemployment is going to climb.
[02:45:00.480 --> 02:45:11.248]  And the figures that we saw come out yesterday, even though they're bogus figures, even they show that we are in a recession.
[02:45:11.768 --> 02:45:13.590]  And it's not going to get better, it's going to get worse.
[02:45:15.216 --> 02:45:16.457]  Well, I mean, that's all over the place.
[02:45:16.497 --> 02:45:21.400]  I mean, I'm constantly watching CNBC, and it's just kind of out in the open.
[02:45:21.420 --> 02:45:22.620]  Yeah, we're in a recession.
[02:45:22.940 --> 02:45:26.903]  The only people that are telling us that we're not and we're going to be okay are really this administration.
[02:45:27.303 --> 02:45:28.384]  Well, maybe Fox News, too.
[02:45:29.524 --> 02:45:35.247]  But it's such a thinly-veiled lie when we really don't produce anything in this country anymore.
[02:45:35.267 --> 02:45:37.889]  I mean, what do we make in this country now, Bob?
[02:45:39.212 --> 02:45:51.198]  Well, we make a few cars and trucks, and there are things we make, but we're down from about 25% 25 years ago of manufacturing the things that we use and need.
[02:45:51.979 --> 02:45:53.780]  We're down to about 11%.
[02:45:54.760 --> 02:46:04.465]  And that's why, if the dollar were to fall in the USDX, which is a dollar index, it's around 72 right now, and it's down from 130 several years ago.
[02:46:08.975 --> 02:46:22.288]  If it drops down to, say, 50 or 55, which I think it will, then people think that our exports will pick up and our GDP will increase and our balance of payments will be, our deficit will be reduced.
[02:46:22.328 --> 02:46:23.990]  And that's not going to be the case.
[02:46:24.371 --> 02:46:27.514]  It'll add about one-half of 1% to GDP.
[02:46:27.854 --> 02:46:31.458]  And that's it because, as you say, we don't make very much anymore.
[02:46:32.114 --> 02:46:34.055]  No, it seems like everything is outsourced.
[02:46:34.615 --> 02:46:43.798]  You know, I see a lot of kids getting out of college and they're still flipping burgers or working in restaurants and living with their parents and they don't know why they can't find a job in their field.
[02:46:43.858 --> 02:46:45.999]  And I'm like, well, number one, the economy's bad.
[02:46:46.059 --> 02:46:47.939]  Number two, we don't really produce anything.
[02:46:48.459 --> 02:46:53.461]  And number three, it seems like the biggest thing is the technology market and that's the easiest to outsource.
[02:46:53.901 --> 02:46:59.083]  I mean, how many times have you called about computer repair and you get somebody on the line who's from Pakistan or India?
[02:46:59.583 --> 02:47:05.665]  So I really wonder where this country is headed in terms of, you know, gross national product.
[02:47:05.765 --> 02:47:06.946]  What are we going to make?
[02:47:07.266 --> 02:47:11.407]  What are we going to produce that the rest of the world absolutely needs other than ideas?
[02:47:11.767 --> 02:47:12.808]  I mean, what are we going to do?
[02:47:13.948 --> 02:47:16.909]  Within five years, IBM will be a foreign corporation.
[02:47:18.510 --> 02:47:19.330]  And they've told us that.
[02:47:20.930 --> 02:47:21.851]  And that's very scary.
[02:47:21.871 --> 02:47:23.211]  It's a national conglomerate.
[02:47:23.791 --> 02:47:28.133]  And as a result of that, I know people who have two degrees.
[02:47:29.133 --> 02:47:29.913]  And three degrees!
[02:47:30.974 --> 02:47:34.495]  That are making $32,000 and $35,000 and $40,000 a year.
[02:47:35.175 --> 02:47:40.116]  Because someone in another place is willing to do their job for $12,000 a year.
[02:47:41.337 --> 02:47:42.797]  And so, what is the solution?
[02:47:43.417 --> 02:47:44.098]  Very simple.
[02:47:44.958 --> 02:47:48.619]  The end of free trade, globalization, offshoring, and outsourcing.
[02:47:49.519 --> 02:47:52.520]  We need tariffs on goods and services.
[02:47:53.100 --> 02:47:58.122]  We have to go back to what we were doing before that made America great.
[02:47:59.153 --> 02:48:02.674]  And all the other countries will do the same thing, and that's okay.
[02:48:03.034 --> 02:48:06.375]  It's going to cause inflation in the United States, that's okay.
[02:48:07.295 --> 02:48:20.838]  It'll be a pittance compared to the inflation that is created every single day by the privately owned Federal Reserve, which is pouring money and credit into our economy at a rate of 18% annually.
[02:48:21.839 --> 02:48:23.259]  That's a devaluation.
[02:48:23.908 --> 02:48:27.451]  You know, that's another great thing that Ron Paul was able to provide us with.
[02:48:27.471 --> 02:48:31.515]  It was an awakening to the fact that the Federal Reserve is anything but federal.
[02:48:48.169 --> 02:48:50.051]  And that it doesn't have our best interest at heart.
[02:48:50.091 --> 02:48:52.513]  In fact, it doesn't have American interest at heart at all.
[02:48:52.913 --> 02:48:58.779]  It has the interest of producing more capital and more power for them, for the elite at heart.
[02:48:59.299 --> 02:49:01.781]  And now people seem to be waking up to that.
[02:49:01.841 --> 02:49:04.023]  I mean, my friends know about the Federal Reserve.
[02:49:04.264 --> 02:49:06.105]  A lot of them are getting into gold and silver.
[02:49:06.145 --> 02:49:12.511]  They realize that this system is not very well regulated, that they just print the money out of thin air and it's not backed.
[02:49:12.711 --> 02:49:14.613]  In five years, the system will have come down.
[02:49:14.653 --> 02:49:15.413]  The Fed will be no more, and the U.S.
[02:49:15.453 --> 02:49:16.894]  Treasury will go back to fulfilling that duty.
[02:49:16.914 --> 02:49:18.395]  And that's what we need in America, along with tariffs.
[02:49:18.415 --> 02:49:19.956]  We have to have a level playing field.
[02:49:19.977 --> 02:49:20.377]  It's not fair
[02:49:42.679 --> 02:49:51.926]  That our industries should move to another country and still expect to sell in our own country while putting people out of work.
[02:49:52.046 --> 02:49:54.648]  I mean, it's just absolute insanity!
[02:49:55.289 --> 02:49:56.550]  And who makes out?
[02:49:57.090 --> 02:50:02.754]  Well, the countries that didn't have this advantage before are making out fine.
[02:50:02.774 --> 02:50:05.456]  We'll take China and India as examples, even Mexico.
[02:50:06.377 --> 02:50:09.960]  And the transnational corporations are making all the money.
[02:50:11.133 --> 02:50:12.415]  This is really where it's at.
[02:50:12.795 --> 02:50:19.543]  They're making 75% of the profit, at least, on this outsourcing and so on and so forth.
[02:50:20.264 --> 02:50:28.034]  And you can't have... You won't have anybody going and getting degrees in America if we continue to do what we're doing.
[02:50:29.113 --> 02:50:31.677]  People with 2 and 3 degrees making $35,000 a year.
[02:50:31.717 --> 02:50:32.478]  That's absurd!
[02:50:32.819 --> 02:50:36.064]  It's absolutely insane, especially with the low price of the dollar.
[02:50:36.124 --> 02:50:39.510]  I mean, it's unreal, but it's where we are today in America.
[02:50:39.550 --> 02:50:40.351]  We'll be back after this.
[02:50:40.411 --> 02:50:41.653]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:50:41.913 --> 02:50:42.775]  It's Independence Day!
[02:50:48.208 --> 02:50:50.249]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[02:50:50.389 --> 02:50:52.790]  I've come with a message of information.
[02:50:52.810 --> 02:50:55.031]  9-11 was an inside job.
[02:50:55.071 --> 02:50:56.611]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[02:50:56.631 --> 02:50:58.252]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[02:50:58.332 --> 02:51:01.153]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[02:51:01.213 --> 02:51:05.854]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR, or you?
[02:51:07.535 --> 02:51:14.487]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[02:51:14.527 --> 02:51:19.455]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[02:51:20.677 --> 02:51:21.778]  An inside job.
[02:51:23.200 --> 02:51:25.442]  How dare you?
[02:51:25.622 --> 02:51:30.667]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[02:51:30.687 --> 02:51:33.490]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[02:51:33.510 --> 02:51:39.796]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[02:53:17.527 --> 02:53:23.630]  And it works at home, the office, or even in other countries to grab television channels and video feeds at your command.
[02:53:23.950 --> 02:53:28.252]  GCN listeners can use it to watch hundreds of conspiracy videos absolutely free.
[02:53:28.752 --> 02:53:32.915]  Best of all, you could be watching free TV on your PC in five minutes or less.
[02:53:33.075 --> 02:53:33.916]  It's that simple.
[02:53:34.216 --> 02:53:37.519]  Just go to www.orderfreetv.com.
[02:53:37.839 --> 02:53:40.841]  That's www.orderfreetv.com.
[02:53:41.121 --> 02:53:46.806]  To watch unregulated TV on your PC, go to www.orderfreetv.com.
[02:53:53.250 --> 02:53:54.571]  I was a highway man.
[02:53:55.472 --> 02:53:57.794]  Along the coach roads I did ride.
[02:53:59.957 --> 02:54:23.934]  With sword and pistol by my side Many a young maid lost her marbles to my trade Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade The masters hung me in the spring of twenty-five But I am still alive
[02:54:28.783 --> 02:54:31.405]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:31.485 --> 02:54:35.767]  I could listen to this all day.
[02:54:35.807 --> 02:54:37.248]  Love the Highwaymen.
[02:54:57.860 --> 02:54:59.781]  Folks, this is the time.
[02:55:00.361 --> 02:55:01.681]  This is the time to step it up.
[02:55:01.761 --> 02:55:03.362]  This is the time to take the government back.
[02:55:04.762 --> 02:55:16.246]  We got somebody who ran for the presidency on the Republican ticket, who brought truth to power, that brought truth to the people, that has a number one best-selling book with the word manifesto in it.
[02:55:17.127 --> 02:55:26.990]  We have more and more people waking up to 9-11 than ever despite the mainstream media trying to put out its propaganda and its mainstream hit pieces like the one by the BBC coming up.
[02:55:28.160 --> 02:55:29.963]  And we have a new tool in the Infowar today.
[02:55:30.524 --> 02:55:40.298]  We have 9-11 Chronicles Truth Rising that you can get over at PrisonPlanet.tv right this very second in the highest of qualities for around 15 cents a day.
[02:55:40.899 --> 02:55:42.482]  So we hope that you come and you join us.
[02:55:43.186 --> 02:56:12.431]  In this epic struggle against hearing and we're gonna have Luke Rudowsky on in the next hour to talk about we are change actions and what's going on in New York City this year on the anniversary of 9-11 but right now we're wrapping it up with Bob Chapman of the international forecaster dot com and you know it seems like we have a pretty grim future of the world when you know somebody just passing by listening to this radio but I'm an optimist I believe if we can wake enough people up there's no need
[02:56:13.046 --> 02:56:14.768]  Well, I think so, but it's going to be painful.
[02:56:14.788 --> 02:56:16.449]  There's lots of things that have to be done.
[02:56:37.122 --> 02:56:43.146]  To undo all the excesses that have been done by the governments and those behind government in the past.
[02:56:43.707 --> 02:56:49.691]  And we've got to start out by clearing Congress and working at the local levels in your counties, cities, states, towns.
[02:56:50.651 --> 02:56:59.137]  Get rid of the people who want to spend your money wantonly, no matter how good the thing might sound that they want to spend it on.
[02:57:00.078 --> 02:57:04.721]  Because we're in a time where the world economy, and especially the American economy,
[02:57:05.245 --> 02:57:06.626]  It's slowing down dramatically.
[02:57:06.686 --> 02:57:07.887]  Unemployment is going higher.
[02:57:08.607 --> 02:57:10.969]  Inflation is already into hyperinflation.
[02:57:11.569 --> 02:57:13.651]  We need a statesman to lead us.
[02:57:13.851 --> 02:57:19.915]  And he either doesn't have the opportunity to be there or isn't there.
[02:57:20.576 --> 02:57:29.742]  And so we got to work through Congress because the two people that we have that look like they're going to be the nominees certainly don't fill the bill.
[02:57:30.622 --> 02:57:33.084]  And so it's going to be a struggle.
[02:57:35.203 --> 02:57:36.724]  You've got to get yourself out of debt.
[02:57:36.904 --> 02:57:39.465]  You've got to get it into gold and silver-related assets.
[02:57:39.926 --> 02:57:44.588]  You have to have your insurance policy, which is food at home and ways to defend your family.
[02:57:45.208 --> 02:57:48.010]  And these are the things that are very important for you to do now.
[02:57:49.270 --> 02:57:54.033]  Absolutely, and to me again, it's all about spreading this to your friends, your family.
[02:57:54.433 --> 02:57:57.615]  Today, while you're flipping burgers, maybe it's time to talk about the economy.
[02:57:57.655 --> 02:58:01.737]  Maybe it's time to say, hey, it's time to step up.
[02:58:02.682 --> 02:58:03.563]  You want to make change?
[02:58:04.043 --> 02:58:06.585]  Like he said, a lot of the congressional seats are vacated.
[02:58:07.106 --> 02:58:09.367]  I want to thank you, Bob Chapman, for spending an hour with us.
[02:58:09.447 --> 02:58:11.329]  It's TheInternationalForecaster.com.

[02:58:38.106 --> 02:58:39.766]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:58:40.066 --> 02:58:43.508]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:58:43.688 --> 02:58:45.488]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:58:46.009 --> 02:58:48.870]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:58:49.170 --> 02:58:54.631]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:58:54.912 --> 02:58:58.813]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[02:58:59.153 --> 02:59:04.074]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[02:59:04.354 --> 02:59:07.115]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[02:59:36.222 --> 02:59:37.562]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:59:40.763 --> 02:59:42.684]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:43.144 --> 02:59:45.945]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:59:58.357 --> 03:00:00.617]  It's Independence Day, July 4th, 2008!
[03:00:00.677 --> 03:00:04.478]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:05.678 --> 03:00:09.199]  The one place you're gonna find the truth in this crazy, mixed-up world we live in.
[03:00:10.059 --> 03:00:10.719]  No spin.
[03:00:11.540 --> 03:00:12.440]  Just the real deal.
[03:00:12.480 --> 03:00:13.500]  What's really happening.
[03:00:14.020 --> 03:00:15.000]  The real economics.
[03:00:15.680 --> 03:00:18.541]  The men behind the throne.
[03:00:19.401 --> 03:00:24.102]  Those that cower behind the curtain with their gold and rubies and greed.
[03:00:25.484 --> 03:00:27.945]  The ones that call us sheep, cattle, chattel.
[03:00:30.326 --> 03:00:31.206]  Useless feeders.
[03:00:33.507 --> 03:00:34.688]  They're the ones I'm after.
[03:00:35.788 --> 03:00:37.289]  The ones that carried out 9-11.
[03:00:37.309 --> 03:00:38.869]  The ones that continue to cover it up.
[03:00:39.790 --> 03:00:41.050]  We will bring them to justice.
[03:00:41.110 --> 03:00:41.750]  I promise you.
[03:00:42.451 --> 03:00:43.511]  People will go down.
[03:00:45.732 --> 03:00:47.072]  Thank God for Dennis Kucinich.
[03:00:48.153 --> 03:00:49.773]  Kucinich.us right now.
[03:00:49.833 --> 03:00:50.234]  Go there.
[03:00:50.254 --> 03:00:51.834]  Kucinich.us right now.
[03:00:51.874 --> 03:00:52.274]  Go there.
[03:00:52.294 --> 03:00:52.955]  Kucinich.us.
[03:00:54.252 --> 03:00:55.993]  Right now, go there, sign the petition.
[03:00:56.293 --> 03:00:58.513]  Make sure that these articles of impeachment are followed up on.
[03:00:59.093 --> 03:01:05.495]  Make sure we send a strong, super strong message that we're not going to take it.
[03:01:07.116 --> 03:01:12.117]  Alright, we're still trying to get Luke on the line, but while we do that, let's take your calls, let's shoot through them.
[03:01:12.137 --> 03:01:14.918]  We've got a bunch of calls, as always, but they've been waiting for a long time.
[03:01:15.058 --> 03:01:17.298]  Fred in Philly, thank you for waiting so long, sir.
[03:01:19.519 --> 03:01:19.939]  Freddy there?
[03:01:21.360 --> 03:01:21.540]  Hello?
[03:01:23.740 --> 03:01:24.260]  I'm right here.
[03:01:24.280 --> 03:01:25.040]  All right, man.
[03:01:25.060 --> 03:01:25.301]  What's up?
[03:01:25.321 --> 03:01:25.801]  All right.
[03:01:25.821 --> 03:01:26.761]  I had to really wait.
[03:01:28.402 --> 03:01:36.124]  I think you've got to remember that NIST is an agency that does a lot of classified work.
[03:01:36.224 --> 03:01:47.668]  There's a whole section of NIST that is in that category, in that classification of a secret agency.
[03:01:49.149 --> 03:01:51.009]  And also, they're very manipulatable.
[03:01:53.177 --> 03:02:02.102]  Because of that fact, they're not independent, as you can tell if you look into the way some of these agencies are.
[03:02:03.763 --> 03:02:04.724]  They're not independent.
[03:02:04.784 --> 03:02:18.912]  So, the other thing I just want to mention is I want to differ on and just discuss with you the fact that we don't seem to have anyone on our side who has been
[03:02:21.363 --> 03:02:23.904]  You know, someone like a cabinet officer.
[03:02:24.245 --> 03:02:38.872]  I know we have some of these former officials, but we don't have anyone who's actually had to give up anything, who has actually taken a risk and lost everything to oppose Bush.
[03:02:39.052 --> 03:02:40.093]  What about Cynthia McKinney?
[03:02:41.758 --> 03:02:43.559]  I mean, she's not in office now, but she did it.
[03:02:43.859 --> 03:02:47.360]  I mean, she held an actual 9-11 truth event on Capitol Hill.
[03:02:47.861 --> 03:02:51.882]  Not only that, she confronted Rumsfeld about the missing trillions and the war games that morning.
[03:02:51.902 --> 03:02:53.963]  She was the first person to go public about that.
[03:02:53.983 --> 03:02:55.183]  True, I know.
[03:02:55.203 --> 03:02:57.765]  Cynthia McKinney was not in their camp.
[03:02:58.485 --> 03:03:06.088]  You don't have anyone who has said, I'm going to now join the forces of truth.
[03:03:06.784 --> 03:03:08.125]  From where I was.
[03:03:27.938 --> 03:03:28.998]  I'm going to apologize.
[03:03:29.038 --> 03:03:31.719]  We screwed up that day, but he's on this new BBC special.
[03:03:31.919 --> 03:03:34.220]  He's talking about... Marshall Jesus Clark, right?
[03:03:34.260 --> 03:03:35.741]  He's, um... Richard Clark.
[03:03:35.801 --> 03:03:37.141]  He's the... Yeah, Richard Clark.
[03:03:37.761 --> 03:03:42.363]  It's, um... It's, um... But, I mean, I'm not... It's not that I'm arguing.
[03:03:42.423 --> 03:03:46.544]  It's just that I see, um... a certain dynamic at work.
[03:03:46.824 --> 03:03:49.545]  Now, we had a, uh... William Odom.
[03:03:50.246 --> 03:03:52.806]  Odom, who was the, uh... Was he the Joint Chief of Staff?
[03:03:53.407 --> 03:03:55.367]  I'm not quite sure with the name, but go ahead.
[03:03:55.747 --> 03:03:57.448]  Uh, he denounced Bush.
[03:03:58.191 --> 03:04:03.973]  Vehemently, on the Charlie Rose Show a couple of years ago, but he just passed.
[03:04:04.333 --> 03:04:08.235]  You don't have any military that have... But so has Brzezinski.
[03:04:08.275 --> 03:04:12.257]  You know, all these guys love to pick on Bush because he's a huge target and an easy one at that.
[03:04:12.297 --> 03:04:15.698]  I mean, the guy is obviously, you know, he's not the smartest guy in the world.
[03:04:15.758 --> 03:04:16.999]  He's not the best speechwriter.
[03:04:17.299 --> 03:04:21.760]  He's an easy target, in my opinion, and I just don't think anybody's gone that hardcore.
[03:04:21.780 --> 03:04:25.302]  I guess I could say that Kurt Weldon also sacrificed a lot as a
[03:04:26.235 --> 03:04:27.436]  Congressman from Pennsylvania.
[03:04:27.476 --> 03:04:28.677]  I thank you for the call, Fred.
[03:04:29.057 --> 03:04:30.598]  We're going to jump through your calls on this side.
[03:04:30.638 --> 03:04:34.080]  Remember, 9-11 Truth Rising, out now, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:04:45.587 --> 03:04:52.572]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero, and we knew what to do.
[03:04:53.413 --> 03:04:54.393]  At least we thought we did.
[03:04:54.613 --> 03:05:01.016]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[03:05:01.656 --> 03:05:08.378]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air
[03:05:09.056 --> 03:05:10.217]  We're safe to breathe.
[03:05:10.558 --> 03:05:17.366]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[03:05:17.666 --> 03:05:20.709]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[03:05:20.830 --> 03:05:25.955]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[03:05:26.596 --> 03:05:29.257]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[03:05:29.678 --> 03:05:35.521]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[03:05:35.721 --> 03:05:38.262]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[03:05:38.642 --> 03:05:43.565]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[03:05:46.314 --> 03:05:52.058]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[03:05:52.398 --> 03:05:58.002]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high-stress lifestyles.
[03:05:58.343 --> 03:06:02.205]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[03:06:02.506 --> 03:06:07.409]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[03:06:07.649 --> 03:06:15.796]  At SnyderHealth.com we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science, the leader in water ionization technology for over 25 years.
[03:06:16.156 --> 03:06:26.164]  Instantly transform ordinary tap water into clean, living, energized water containing alkaline minerals, disease-fighting antioxidants, and highly absorbable oxygen.
[03:06:26.424 --> 03:06:31.228]  Now you can easily and effectively rid your body of harmful acidic waste with alkaline ionized water.
[03:06:31.608 --> 03:06:35.650]  Let SnyderHealth.com provide the water ionizer that's right for you and your family.

[03:06:39.951 --> 03:06:41.112]  That's SnyderHealth.com.
[03:06:44.858 --> 03:06:47.920]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[03:06:48.300 --> 03:06:50.362]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[03:06:50.602 --> 03:06:53.624]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[03:06:53.904 --> 03:07:00.389]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[03:07:00.789 --> 03:07:02.911]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[03:07:03.391 --> 03:07:06.472]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[03:07:06.692 --> 03:07:11.333]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[03:07:11.473 --> 03:07:15.175]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.

[03:07:45.089 --> 03:07:50.132]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:07:50.552 --> 03:07:52.774]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:07:55.955 --> 03:08:06.564]  Alright, we're gonna play another clip.
[03:08:07.925 --> 03:08:11.008]  And, uh, I gotta play this one because it really just shows how
[03:08:12.088 --> 03:08:13.669]  The British power really never left.
[03:08:14.110 --> 03:08:15.471]  Now we're in bed with them.
[03:08:15.551 --> 03:08:18.053]  The Royal Family are not good people.
[03:08:18.773 --> 03:08:27.420]  This is a big toasting, I think, with Nelson Rockefeller, Queen Elizabeth, and Gerald Ford when he was the Vice President of the United States.
[03:08:27.480 --> 03:08:28.441]  A big love fest.
[03:08:29.102 --> 03:08:31.203]  And let's just play the clip.
[03:08:31.243 --> 03:08:32.624]  It was on C-SPAN the other day.
[03:08:32.644 --> 03:08:35.207]  Oh, old history.
[03:08:35.267 --> 03:08:36.127]  This is 1976, folks.
[03:08:36.147 --> 03:08:37.088]  Upgrade our past.
[03:08:42.250 --> 03:08:47.093]  We also look forward with confidence to working for a better life for all humanity.
[03:08:48.574 --> 03:08:58.719]  In our third century, I know that the United Kingdom will be on our side, and the United States will be on your side.
[03:09:07.764 --> 03:09:11.106]  Your Royal Highness, ladies and gentlemen,
[03:09:12.051 --> 03:09:12.291]  Queen.
[03:09:18.055 --> 03:09:27.340]  Queen.
[03:09:27.380 --> 03:09:34.184]  Permanence.
[03:09:34.904 --> 03:09:36.185]  Anglo-American friendship.
[03:09:46.465 --> 03:09:48.966]  It has grown and prospered down the years.
[03:09:50.106 --> 03:09:53.867]  It has brought with it benefits beyond measure to our peoples.
[03:09:55.847 --> 03:10:02.949]  May it long continue to flourish for the sake of both our countries and for the greater good of mankind.
[03:10:05.269 --> 03:10:13.611]  Mr. President, I raise my glass to you and to Mrs. Ford to the 200th birthday of America.
[03:10:14.574 --> 03:10:17.855]  And to the happiness of our staunch and generous people.
[03:10:20.576 --> 03:10:37.801]  Here it is, folks, just a big old love fest between Nelson Rockefeller, Gerald Ford, and the Queen on Independence Day.
[03:10:37.821 --> 03:10:43.643]  It's actually on 7-7, it's a few days after, but in remembrance of the 200th anniversary of this country.
[03:10:45.816 --> 03:10:46.076]  Yeah.
[03:10:46.917 --> 03:10:53.463]  I mean, unfortunately, the British royal family likes to joke and goof on each other overseas.
[03:10:53.503 --> 03:10:54.865]  They own most of the tabloids.
[03:10:54.925 --> 03:10:58.829]  Prince Philip does that on purpose to make it look like they don't have any power.
[03:10:58.849 --> 03:10:59.309]  Well, they do.
[03:10:59.369 --> 03:11:00.190]  They got a ton of power.
[03:11:01.601 --> 03:11:03.222]  The royalty has never left.
[03:11:03.242 --> 03:11:05.442]  These people really do think that they're better than us.
[03:11:05.802 --> 03:11:06.922]  I mean, did you hear her voice?
[03:11:07.122 --> 03:11:07.443]  Yes.
[03:11:08.403 --> 03:11:10.543]  The queen and everything is good.
[03:11:11.523 --> 03:11:16.125]  And we shall prosper with our Anglo-American friendship forever.
[03:11:18.445 --> 03:11:18.985]  Makes me ill.
[03:11:19.265 --> 03:11:20.486]  When are people going to wake up?
[03:11:20.526 --> 03:11:26.447]  I mean, I guess a few people may have woken up overseas when they killed Dai, because a lot of people are hip to that fact.
[03:11:27.156 --> 03:11:29.741]  But, you know, again, Prince Charles, not a good person.
[03:11:29.781 --> 03:11:30.823]  Prince Philip especially.
[03:11:31.083 --> 03:11:32.786]  Prince Philip's a huge, uh, eugenicist.
[03:11:33.147 --> 03:11:35.010]  You know, he want- talk about population control.
[03:11:35.070 --> 03:11:36.132]  He doesn't want me and you alive.
[03:11:36.873 --> 03:11:38.316]  Dodi, uh, Fayyad's father.
[03:11:39.446 --> 03:11:49.554]  Uh, he got on the Stern Show and said that, you know, Prince Philip was a Nazi and an occultist and that he was a homosexual and all these other things.
[03:11:49.614 --> 03:11:53.658]  And of course, Prince Philip can't do anything, but he's like, do you think Prince Philip's gonna try to sue me?
[03:11:53.718 --> 03:11:54.718]  He's like, he's a rich man.
[03:11:54.758 --> 03:11:55.259]  He could do it.
[03:11:55.299 --> 03:11:55.919]  I'm a rich man.
[03:11:55.959 --> 03:11:56.840]  He could get money out of me.
[03:11:56.860 --> 03:11:58.341]  He's like, but everything I'm saying is true.
[03:11:59.442 --> 03:11:59.923]  Look into it.
[03:11:59.943 --> 03:12:00.683]  Check that interview out.
[03:12:00.723 --> 03:12:01.364]  It's a really good one.
[03:12:01.804 --> 03:12:02.104]  All right.
[03:12:02.144 --> 03:12:04.886]  Let's see if Jeff in Massachusetts is still on the line.
[03:12:04.927 --> 03:12:05.607]  Jeff, are you with me?
[03:12:07.569 --> 03:12:08.009]  Jeff, you there?
[03:12:09.522 --> 03:12:10.182]  Yes, I'm right here.
[03:12:10.522 --> 03:12:11.223]  Alright, what's up, man?
[03:12:11.503 --> 03:12:11.843]  Oh, yes.
[03:12:12.543 --> 03:12:19.506]  Now, as far as the sheeple is concerned, I believe that the demise of America will come in a two-pronged fashion.
[03:12:19.926 --> 03:12:25.308]  First off, at least in my neck of the woods, most of the sheeple really don't care about politics.
[03:12:25.528 --> 03:12:28.009]  They just want a politician to butter their bread.
[03:12:28.569 --> 03:12:29.589]  Give them the bacon.
[03:12:30.670 --> 03:12:37.172]  And once the bacon runs out, then you have rioting and stuff like that, then martial law will be imposed.
[03:12:37.592 --> 03:12:38.993]  Once martial law is imposed,
[03:12:39.451 --> 03:12:47.423]  There's going to be no more radio, no more conservative alternative media, absolutely nothing, and that's what I'm afraid of.
[03:12:47.724 --> 03:12:51.029]  I want to be afraid, but that's a day I dread, because
[03:12:51.898 --> 03:12:54.919]  Because once freedom has been stifled, I mean, that's it.
[03:12:55.059 --> 03:13:02.162]  Well, the thing is that that would only happen locally unless there was some kind of a big contrived provocatory event such as a dirty bomb or a bio-attack.
[03:13:02.482 --> 03:13:09.284]  I mean, you're not going to get that even in a local riot, you know, because of some political leader.
[03:13:09.584 --> 03:13:10.684]  I don't see that happening.
[03:13:10.724 --> 03:13:15.186]  What worries me, however, is the release of a bio-weapon or a dirty
[03:13:15.526 --> 03:13:16.767]  We're good to go.
[03:13:41.881 --> 03:13:44.483]  You know, so they can't take us down all the way.
[03:13:44.523 --> 03:13:46.404]  You know, they can stop us on AM and FM.
[03:13:46.664 --> 03:13:49.466]  They may be even able to regulate us on the internet.
[03:13:49.846 --> 03:13:53.248]  But shortwave radios are the ones that people listen to in disasters, man.
[03:13:53.829 --> 03:13:56.190]  No, no, you're absolutely right.
[03:13:56.250 --> 03:13:59.052]  And the part about the dirty bomb, I thought about that too.
[03:13:59.072 --> 03:14:00.933]  Because I'm studying to be an EMT.
[03:14:01.634 --> 03:14:06.777]  If a dirty bomb ever went off, the paramedics and the EMTs will not want to touch that.
[03:14:07.077 --> 03:14:10.039]  And there's only so many hazmat teams to go around.
[03:14:10.632 --> 03:14:11.412]  I think so.
[03:14:26.141 --> 03:14:27.882]  But I just hope that doesn't happen.
[03:14:28.002 --> 03:14:34.167]  Well, a lot of people are talking about that Russia-Chinese alliance to bring in World War III very possible.
[03:14:34.367 --> 03:14:35.548]  Might be on the horizon.
[03:14:36.228 --> 03:14:40.431]  You know, I'm more concerned about the Middle East right now, but that doesn't mean that's not in the back of my mind.
[03:14:40.751 --> 03:14:41.672]  I thank you for the call.
[03:14:41.732 --> 03:14:44.714]  All right, let's pop to Ellie in Toronto.
[03:14:44.774 --> 03:14:45.334]  Ellie, are you there?
[03:14:46.495 --> 03:14:47.075]  Hey, Sean.
[03:14:47.115 --> 03:14:47.916]  How you doing, man?
[03:14:48.136 --> 03:14:48.617]  How you doing, man?
[03:14:49.337 --> 03:14:51.919]  Sean, first off, before I go ahead,
[03:14:54.028 --> 03:15:13.116]  I'd just like to let you know that, you know, I'm a great fan of your movies, especially Lose Change, Final Cut, although I still run into people who are, like, you know, still thinking it's like a conspiracy theory, and God knows what.
[03:15:13.216 --> 03:15:14.176]  I'm sure you do, too.
[03:15:14.337 --> 03:15:14.677]  Oh, sure.
[03:15:15.517 --> 03:15:15.777]  Okay.
[03:15:16.417 --> 03:15:19.559]  Anyway, I wanted to comment in regards to the
[03:15:20.580 --> 03:15:36.130]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[03:15:48.033 --> 03:15:51.655]  General, public, or civilian type products.
[03:15:52.075 --> 03:16:07.963]  But when it comes to military arms, like jet planes, radar equipment, surface-to-air missiles, and God knows what else, the United States is still one of the top manufacturers of arms.
[03:16:08.543 --> 03:16:12.925]  Maybe that is one of the reasons.
[03:16:14.766 --> 03:16:16.547]  I'm sure you remember Larry Nichols,
[03:16:17.062 --> 03:16:19.723]  When he was on the show talking to Alex Jones.
[03:16:19.763 --> 03:16:27.547]  So Larry Nichols is the one that exposed the Clintons and the Clinton Chronicles and shows the false left-right paradigm.
[03:16:27.788 --> 03:16:32.850]  We love conflict because this is how we ensure control.
[03:16:33.791 --> 03:16:43.956]  And I think the best way the United States, aka globally, they get control is one of the ways
[03:16:44.568 --> 03:16:45.629]  It's a good question.
[03:17:05.373 --> 03:17:05.953]  Well, absolutely.
[03:17:05.973 --> 03:17:13.397]  I mean, these things are outsourced to private companies all the time, like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon and Boeing, and a lot of it remains classified.
[03:17:13.437 --> 03:17:15.318]  But yeah, that's what we make the problem is.
[03:17:15.338 --> 03:17:16.679]  That's not for public consumption.
[03:17:16.719 --> 03:17:24.003]  It's on a very limited level, and the people that are getting rich aren't the people that are working in the factories, and they're few and far between anyway.
[03:17:24.423 --> 03:17:28.505]  It's the people at the top, the people that have moved over to Dubai, I mean, to get out of this country.
[03:17:28.766 --> 03:17:30.607]  It's absolutely ludicrous stuff.
[03:17:30.867 --> 03:17:31.667]  Thank you for the call.
[03:17:31.707 --> 03:17:34.169]  Let's move to Dave in California.
[03:17:34.209 --> 03:17:34.869]  What's happening, Dave?
[03:17:35.583 --> 03:17:38.164]  Jason, happy birthday, America, man.
[03:17:38.184 --> 03:17:38.804]  I hear ya.
[03:17:38.824 --> 03:17:39.444]  I hear ya.
[03:17:39.464 --> 03:17:40.605]  You guys are great.
[03:17:40.785 --> 03:17:43.866]  Lew Grodowski, if you're there, if you're listening, man, we love you.
[03:17:44.286 --> 03:17:50.248]  We're not giving up whoever it is that thinks we're gonna roll over for China or Russia or any of them.
[03:17:50.528 --> 03:17:52.189]  Obama, it does not matter.
[03:17:52.409 --> 03:17:53.269]  The truth is out.
[03:17:53.509 --> 03:17:54.050]  It is out.
[03:17:54.170 --> 03:17:56.130]  It's never gonna get put back in the can.
[03:17:56.411 --> 03:17:57.171]  They can try.
[03:17:57.191 --> 03:17:59.872]  They can fake things out.
[03:17:59.932 --> 03:18:00.572]  They can lie.
[03:18:00.612 --> 03:18:03.273]  They can put their little pundits up there and they can scream at us.
[03:18:03.880 --> 03:18:05.220]  Nothing is working anymore.
[03:18:05.240 --> 03:18:06.941]  We've got DVDs everywhere.
[03:18:07.281 --> 03:18:08.221]  People are waking up.
[03:18:08.301 --> 03:18:09.861]  It's just not going to stop.
[03:18:10.581 --> 03:18:11.862]  Well, I'm with you.
[03:18:11.902 --> 03:18:13.242]  And I love the enthusiasm.
[03:18:13.262 --> 03:18:14.522]  Have you seen Truth Rising yet?
[03:18:14.882 --> 03:18:16.163]  Not yet, but I've got it on order.
[03:18:16.183 --> 03:18:18.723]  But listen, let me do something for you real fast.
[03:18:18.743 --> 03:18:20.423]  You said you were looking for fireworks.
[03:18:20.683 --> 03:18:23.004]  You might want to take your earphones off.
[03:18:25.905 --> 03:18:28.645]  All right, we can't have fireworks on the air, but thank you, Dave.
[03:18:29.545 --> 03:18:30.485]  Oh, that's good stuff.
[03:18:30.545 --> 03:18:31.366]  See, that's what I like.
[03:18:31.426 --> 03:18:32.906]  I like a little bit of enthusiasm.
[03:18:33.698 --> 03:18:36.600]  I like people that are psyched about, you know, independence.
[03:18:36.641 --> 03:18:43.146]  You know, maybe I should put a little, little Metallica ecstasy of gold on this little rant because this is going to be my little independence rant.
[03:18:43.666 --> 03:18:45.628]  You know, I love this country.
[03:18:45.688 --> 03:18:47.710]  You don't, you don't even know how much I love this country.
[03:18:47.750 --> 03:18:50.052]  A lot of people say they love this country.
[03:18:50.072 --> 03:18:51.313]  Well, I love it.
[03:18:52.133 --> 03:18:53.194]  It's Independence Day.
[03:18:54.755 --> 03:19:01.361]  And I got to tell you, if we want our independence, if we truly want to be a free people,
[03:19:03.661 --> 03:19:04.542]  We must rise.
[03:19:05.362 --> 03:19:06.263]  We must stand up.
[03:19:07.804 --> 03:19:08.904]  Against these globalists.
[03:19:09.645 --> 03:19:10.365]  These tyrants.
[03:19:12.066 --> 03:19:14.488]  The people that want to put us in their privatized prisons.
[03:19:15.108 --> 03:19:18.150]  The people that want to charge $5 a gallon of gas, maybe $10.
[03:19:19.731 --> 03:19:22.272]  The people that want to force vaccinations on us.
[03:19:23.053 --> 03:19:25.394]  Vaccinations filled with cancer viruses.
[03:19:26.575 --> 03:19:29.116]  With mercury and poison to dumb us down.
[03:19:29.977 --> 03:19:31.578]  The people that fluoridate our water.
[03:19:32.591 --> 03:19:35.456]  This is why I do this radio show, because I do love America.
[03:19:35.517 --> 03:19:36.418]  I love this country.
[03:19:37.580 --> 03:19:39.785]  I want my Constitution and Bill of Rights back.
[03:19:42.630 --> 03:19:43.391]  Is that so much?
[03:19:45.979 --> 03:19:49.362]  Or are we going to step up for its triumph of reducing government debt?
[03:19:49.583 --> 03:20:01.855]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[03:20:02.275 --> 03:20:02.695]  The U.S.
[03:20:02.735 --> 03:20:08.261]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[03:20:08.681 --> 03:20:10.902]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[03:20:11.663 --> 03:20:13.844]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[03:20:13.864 --> 03:20:16.725]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[03:20:16.825 --> 03:20:22.848]  However, shocking the economy with a reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[03:20:23.288 --> 03:20:26.630]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[03:20:26.710 --> 03:20:33.053]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[03:20:33.613 --> 03:20:37.621]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[03:20:37.741 --> 03:20:38.062]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[03:20:38.082 --> 03:20:38.322]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[03:20:46.678 --> 03:20:53.881]  Even terrible gas prices don't come close to the disaster of food costs from shortages already destroying millions of American families.
[03:20:54.142 --> 03:20:57.663]  Wheat for flour is already four times more expensive than it was about a year ago.
[03:20:58.163 --> 03:21:01.825]  Food costs continue to double because there's no food worldwide.
[03:21:02.205 --> 03:21:11.530]  The only solution is to use now and store for later great flavored super bulk foods that cost half as much as your groceries cost last year.
[03:21:12.150 --> 03:21:16.192]  Get on the web at efoodsdirect.com and find a two-month grab-and-go kit.
[03:21:16.673 --> 03:21:21.115]  This easy fix supply gives you two months worth of three great meals a day.
[03:21:21.535 --> 03:21:22.055]  The cost?
[03:21:22.276 --> 03:21:23.316]  About five dollars a day.
[03:21:23.936 --> 03:21:31.020]  efoodsdirect.com also has a complete bulk supply of superfood at half the cost of last year's groceries.
[03:21:31.421 --> 03:21:33.061]  Call 800-409-5633.
[03:21:33.942 --> 03:21:39.225]  The rest of the world is starving, but what happens in your piece of America is up to you.
[03:21:39.665 --> 03:21:39.946]  Call 800-409-5633.
[03:21:39.966 --> 03:21:40.407]  It is a big idea.
[03:21:40.427 --> 03:21:40.987]  A new world order.
[03:21:41.008 --> 03:21:41.849]  In the near future.
[03:21:51.423 --> 03:21:53.865]  Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[03:21:54.506 --> 03:21:56.627]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:21:57.328 --> 03:21:59.590]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:22:00.110 --> 03:22:02.552]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:22:03.293 --> 03:22:10.619]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:22:13.649 --> 03:22:18.592]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:22:19.073 --> 03:22:22.555]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:22:22.955 --> 03:22:25.457]  Buildberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:22:25.517 --> 03:22:26.658]  Most people have no idea.
[03:22:26.678 --> 03:22:27.458]  They're not after money.
[03:22:27.478 --> 03:22:28.539]  They have all the money they need.
[03:22:28.739 --> 03:22:29.460]  They're after power.
[03:22:29.740 --> 03:22:30.540]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[03:22:42.388 --> 03:22:43.469]  You have been warned.
[03:22:44.790 --> 03:22:53.535]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[03:22:53.715 --> 03:22:58.498]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[03:22:58.858 --> 03:23:09.985]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[03:23:10.385 --> 03:23:15.927]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.

[03:24:24.955 --> 03:24:38.456]  The old familiar sting Try to kill it all away But I remember everything
[03:24:43.103 --> 03:24:45.585]  We're back on Independence Day, folks.
[03:24:47.027 --> 03:24:49.029]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:49.069 --> 03:24:50.410]  I'm Jason Bermas subbing in.
[03:24:50.430 --> 03:24:53.192]  Alex will be back on Sunday, I believe.
[03:24:53.833 --> 03:24:58.918]  And today is the day for Truth Rising, The 9-11 Chronicles Part 1.
[03:25:00.940 --> 03:25:05.184]  It's live at PrisonPlanet.tv in the highest quality we've ever offered anything.
[03:25:06.292 --> 03:25:09.213]  And quite frankly, this is getting four star reviews.
[03:25:09.253 --> 03:25:10.873]  People are very impressed.
[03:25:10.893 --> 03:25:12.553]  Let's read through some of these reviews.
[03:25:13.053 --> 03:25:14.254]  Alex's best film ever.
[03:25:14.334 --> 03:25:15.234]  Five stars.
[03:25:15.334 --> 03:25:16.254]  Alex nailed it.
[03:25:17.054 --> 03:25:19.295]  This may wake up more people than Loose Change.
[03:25:19.455 --> 03:25:20.315]  It's unbelievable.
[03:25:23.075 --> 03:25:24.616]  And we are just so proud of this movie.
[03:25:24.636 --> 03:25:30.537]  In fact, let's play a little sneak peek of Truth Rising right now.
[03:25:46.199 --> 03:25:51.062]  How you doing tonight?
[03:25:51.382 --> 03:25:53.664]  Guess who's going to jail?
[03:25:53.784 --> 03:25:55.625]  Guess who's going to jail?
[03:25:55.965 --> 03:25:58.447]  I think he's got a bomb in his bag.
[03:26:05.279 --> 03:26:13.903]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage that was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR, and Bilderberg Group, sir?
[03:26:14.083 --> 03:26:19.005]  Answer my question.
[03:26:20.405 --> 03:26:21.325]  We love this country.
[03:26:21.346 --> 03:26:25.407]  We should treat our police officers, our fire department, our first responders with respect, sir.
[03:26:25.427 --> 03:26:28.789]  They're getting no respect from you for what you're doing to them, sir.
[03:26:31.610 --> 03:26:32.430]  That's my roommate.
[03:26:33.971 --> 03:26:34.811]  That's his medication.
[03:26:35.956 --> 03:26:37.836]  Can this side of the room, everybody stand up?
[03:26:41.217 --> 03:26:48.498]  Everybody on this side, if you're all rescue workers, you'll be dead in four years.
[03:26:48.578 --> 03:26:49.179]  Are you there?
[03:26:49.339 --> 03:26:50.399]  Are you there?
[03:26:50.619 --> 03:26:51.499]  Are you there?
[03:26:54.600 --> 03:26:55.780]  We're here to defend America.
[03:26:56.800 --> 03:26:57.480]  Yeah, right.
[03:26:57.540 --> 03:26:58.040]  That's right.
[03:26:58.100 --> 03:26:59.221]  Right, right.
[03:26:59.701 --> 03:27:00.901]  You ain't an American.
[03:27:00.941 --> 03:27:01.201]  Come on.
[03:27:02.700 --> 03:27:05.564]  When are you going to investigate World Trade Center 7, sir?
[03:27:05.584 --> 03:27:08.267]  When are you going to investigate World Trade Center 7?
[03:27:08.347 --> 03:27:09.268]  You made your promise!
[03:27:09.429 --> 03:27:12.613]  You made a promise, sir!
[03:27:12.733 --> 03:27:15.336]  Rule Hill is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[03:27:15.356 --> 03:27:18.400]  If violence breaks out, don't worry, we can handle it.
[03:27:26.306 --> 03:27:34.828]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[03:27:35.148 --> 03:27:35.888]  It's true.
[03:27:36.108 --> 03:27:37.269]  An inside job?
[03:27:38.609 --> 03:27:39.649]  How dare you?
[03:27:41.249 --> 03:27:43.330]  How dare you?
[03:27:43.350 --> 03:27:47.011]  Why did Bush not even want to investigate the attack?
[03:27:49.735 --> 03:27:50.555]  9-11 was an inside job!
[03:27:50.575 --> 03:27:52.255]  9-11 was an inside job!
[03:27:52.275 --> 03:27:53.416]  9-11 was an inside job!
[03:27:53.436 --> 03:27:54.376]  9-11 was an inside job!
[03:27:54.396 --> 03:27:55.396]  9-11 was an inside job!
[03:27:55.416 --> 03:27:56.416]  Turn the camera off.
[03:27:56.436 --> 03:27:56.716]  No, sir.
[03:27:56.736 --> 03:27:58.136]  Turn the camera off.
[03:27:58.256 --> 03:27:58.737]  No, sir.
[03:27:58.757 --> 03:28:00.557]  Can I ask you why you're taking my picture?
[03:28:31.452 --> 03:28:33.433]  Gives me goosebumps every time I watch it.
[03:28:34.955 --> 03:28:40.460]  Get the high quality DVD over at InfoWars.com right now or go to PrisonPlanet.tv to see it in the

[03:28:45.953 --> 03:28:49.897]  I really can't wait for people to take this, burn this, and share it with others.
[03:28:49.937 --> 03:28:50.578]  Today's the day.
[03:28:50.618 --> 03:28:51.599]  It's the 4th of July.
[03:28:51.619 --> 03:28:53.881]  There's a ton of barbecues, ton of family get-togethers.
[03:28:54.822 --> 03:28:56.763]  What better day for the truth to rise?
[03:28:57.704 --> 03:29:01.388]  All right, before we go back to callers, I would like to thank eFoods Direct.
[03:29:01.408 --> 03:29:02.869]  They helped make this show possible.
[03:29:02.909 --> 03:29:04.911]  They are one of our biggest sponsors.

[03:29:11.141 --> 03:29:14.043]  We don't need to remind you you need food to survive, folks.

[03:29:17.304 --> 03:29:20.005]  It is eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:29:20.506 --> 03:29:21.566]  And we'll be back after this.
[03:29:21.606 --> 03:29:22.827]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:29:22.887 --> 03:29:23.707]  I'm Jason Burmess.
[03:29:24.087 --> 03:29:24.788]  LooseChange911.com.
[03:29:35.424 --> 03:29:38.426]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:39.346 --> 03:29:42.148]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:48.532 --> 03:29:58.578]  Last month, Ready Reserve Foods stated that by fall, food would be in short supply and the government would be forced to impose controls on food and food distribution because of civil unrest and panic.
[03:29:59.542 --> 03:30:03.167]  Well, the floods in the heartland of America have all but assured this will happen.
[03:30:03.707 --> 03:30:09.735]  It is estimated that 5 million acres of farmland will not be producing over 700 million bushels of corn alone.
[03:30:10.556 --> 03:30:13.920]  If you have ever thought about storing food, now is the time to do so.
[03:30:14.861 --> 03:30:19.703]  Call Ready Reserve Foods at 1-800-453-2202 for a free catalog.
[03:30:20.143 --> 03:30:29.827]  Larry Matlack, President of the American Agriculture Movement, stated on June 6th that the USDA has only enough wheat stored to make one half of a loaf of bread for every American.
[03:30:30.267 --> 03:30:32.448]  Visit us on the web at readyreservefoods.com.

[03:30:32.588 --> 03:30:33.509]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[03:30:33.529 --> 03:30:33.669]  Act now!
[03:30:45.430 --> 03:30:47.451]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[03:30:47.571 --> 03:30:49.973]  I've come with a message of information.
[03:30:49.993 --> 03:30:52.114]  9-11 was an inside job.
[03:30:52.254 --> 03:30:53.815]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[03:30:53.855 --> 03:30:55.416]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[03:30:55.516 --> 03:30:58.357]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[03:30:58.417 --> 03:31:02.240]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[03:31:02.260 --> 03:31:04.501]  Will you please sit down and shut up?
[03:31:04.741 --> 03:31:11.668]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[03:31:11.708 --> 03:31:17.774]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[03:31:17.854 --> 03:31:18.915]  An inside job.
[03:31:20.396 --> 03:31:21.437]  How dare you?
[03:31:22.998 --> 03:31:27.882]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[03:31:27.902 --> 03:31:30.684]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[03:31:30.784 --> 03:31:36.229]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of that.
[03:31:36.269 --> 03:31:37.210]  Truth Rising.
[03:31:37.250 --> 03:31:39.832]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[03:31:40.112 --> 03:31:42.113]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[03:31:42.354 --> 03:31:44.836]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[03:31:46.633 --> 03:31:47.955]  It truly is amazing!
[03:31:47.995 --> 03:31:50.699]  You have to care enough about yourself to want to do something.
[03:31:50.999 --> 03:31:54.383]  If you're tired of feeling sick or run down, this truly is the answer.
[03:31:54.684 --> 03:31:56.106]  I have so much energy now!
[03:31:56.126 --> 03:31:57.608]  It makes you feel good!
[03:31:57.968 --> 03:31:58.910]  And it's all natural.
[03:31:59.330 --> 03:32:01.313]  Everyone in my family takes Cardivite.
[03:32:01.333 --> 03:32:01.874]  Cardivite.
[03:32:01.914 --> 03:32:02.354]  Cardivite.
[03:32:02.434 --> 03:32:04.057]  We all use Cardivite!
[03:32:04.801 --> 03:32:08.284]  Ladies and gentlemen, Heart Drop 2000 presents Cardivite.
[03:32:08.785 --> 03:32:15.131]  Cardivite is an all-natural supplement which is made up of our own special blend of herbs gathered from many different parts of the world.
[03:32:15.271 --> 03:32:19.575]  Specially designed to improve your health, come on and care about yourself just a little more.
[03:32:19.755 --> 03:32:20.435]  Federal Agents!
[03:32:20.615 --> 03:32:21.115]  We are armed!
[03:32:48.622 --> 03:32:53.063]  What would you do if you knew all the things we knew?
[03:32:53.603 --> 03:32:55.544]  Would you stand up for truth?
[03:32:55.684 --> 03:32:58.664]  Or would you turn away, too?
[03:32:58.924 --> 03:33:03.465]  And then what if you saw all of the things that's wrong?
[03:33:03.705 --> 03:33:06.066]  Would you stand tall and strong?
[03:33:06.686 --> 03:33:09.827]  Or would you turn and walk away?
[03:33:09.887 --> 03:33:13.768]  What would you do if you knew all the things we knew?
[03:33:23.075 --> 03:33:43.769]  I see a message from the government like every day I watch it and listen and call them all suckers they wanted me about Osama or whatever picture me buying the scam I said never you in tune to a hard truth soldier spitting I stay committed
[03:33:44.589 --> 03:33:46.570]  Alright folks, it's Independence Day.
[03:33:46.630 --> 03:33:47.630]  And I want to remind people...
[03:34:13.399 --> 03:34:15.600]  There is going to be big events down in New York City.
[03:34:16.020 --> 03:34:18.341]  For some reason, Luke missed out on the interview today.
[03:34:18.361 --> 03:34:18.861]  I don't know why.
[03:34:18.901 --> 03:34:21.422]  He might be down in New York City right now, down at Ground Zero.
[03:34:21.442 --> 03:34:23.602]  But regardless, there's going to be huge events.
[03:34:23.662 --> 03:34:29.204]  WeAreChange.org is where to go check out where and when those events are going to be taking place.
[03:34:30.344 --> 03:34:35.306]  And as of now, it looks like I will be down there showing Fabled Enemies, my new film.
[03:34:35.346 --> 03:34:37.467]  Possibly some other films are going to be shown down there.
[03:34:37.487 --> 03:34:38.187]  It should be a really
[03:34:38.920 --> 03:34:39.701]  Great time.
[03:34:39.721 --> 03:34:41.502]  All right, let's jump to some callers.
[03:34:41.522 --> 03:34:43.563]  Let's go to Chris in New Jersey.
[03:34:43.643 --> 03:34:44.223]  Chris, what's up?
[03:34:45.644 --> 03:34:46.985]  Hey, Jason.
[03:34:47.005 --> 03:34:48.205]  How you doing, man?
[03:34:48.545 --> 03:34:48.966]  All right.
[03:34:49.206 --> 03:35:07.616]  Hey, I just downloaded 9-11 Chronicles last night, watched it all at about one o'clock in the morning, and I know Alex was talking on the show about it being an inspiration to others to get involved, and I've been involved in my own local area, but being 45 minutes out from New York City,
[03:35:08.348 --> 03:35:12.151]  Send Luke a message and let him know that I'll be joining him at Ground Zero sometime soon.
[03:35:12.811 --> 03:35:13.592]  Excellent, excellent.
[03:35:13.612 --> 03:35:14.753]  So you watched it.
[03:35:14.853 --> 03:35:15.933]  Tell the people what it's about.
[03:35:16.014 --> 03:35:18.375]  You know, I've been stringing on it all day.
[03:35:18.415 --> 03:35:21.738]  You tell people what is 9-11 Chronicles Truth Rising.
[03:35:22.338 --> 03:35:31.845]  Well, what I got out of it is that, you know, it's kind of going away from 9-11 being an inside job per se and not really focusing on that.
[03:35:32.560 --> 03:35:41.568]  The first half of it, what I got from it was that you guys really concentrated on the first responders and some of the injustices that happened to them afterwards.
[03:35:42.048 --> 03:35:43.329]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[03:35:43.770 --> 03:35:45.391]  And just seeing all those videos, too.
[03:35:45.431 --> 03:35:50.636]  I mean, I've seen a lot of them on YouTube with Mark Dice and Luke and all the other We Are Change guys.
[03:35:51.296 --> 03:35:56.381]  But just seeing them again, I mean, in some parts I felt like crying, in other parts I felt like laughing.
[03:35:56.829 --> 03:36:01.392]  Well, that's what it's all about, is that it has an upbeat sense, but some of this material is so strong.
[03:36:01.633 --> 03:36:04.415]  And you mentioned how it really begins with the first responders' plight.
[03:36:04.695 --> 03:36:06.836]  Well, it ends with the first responders' plight, too.
[03:36:07.137 --> 03:36:11.920]  And it ends, really, with Dennis Kucinich saying, you know, he's going to be asking questions and getting documents.
[03:36:11.960 --> 03:36:23.529]  And that 35th article of impeachment was because the Bush administration lied about the air quality to the EPA and put all those first responders in early graves, essentially, and gave them health problems.
[03:36:23.949 --> 03:36:26.271]  So, you know, this is a multi-tiered film.
[03:36:26.391 --> 03:36:32.937]  I think for people that are uninitiated, that don't know about the 9-11 Truth Movement, I think it's also an attractive movie to bring them in.
[03:36:32.957 --> 03:36:39.122]  I mean, like you just said, you've been active in your own area, but after seeing this, you're ready to go to New York City and join Luke Radowski.
[03:36:39.902 --> 03:36:40.423]  Absolutely.
[03:36:41.391 --> 03:36:43.373]  All right, Chris, I thank you for the kind words, man.
[03:36:43.393 --> 03:36:44.214]  Keep spreading the truth.
[03:36:44.254 --> 03:36:44.935]  Burning copies.
[03:36:44.955 --> 03:36:46.456]  Hopefully you got that DivX version.
[03:36:46.777 --> 03:36:49.179]  Let's jump over to Frank in New York.
[03:36:49.219 --> 03:36:50.060]  What's going on, Frank?
[03:36:50.300 --> 03:36:51.081]  Hi, how are you doing?
[03:36:51.101 --> 03:36:54.284]  I want to wish you and Alex and everyone a happy 4th.
[03:36:54.945 --> 03:37:03.994]  And I wanted to just ask you a question, and that is, your event is going to be down at Ground Zero, correct?
[03:37:04.014 --> 03:37:04.515]  The screening?
[03:37:05.318 --> 03:37:07.900]  I don't know if the screening will absolutely be at Ground Zero.
[03:37:07.920 --> 03:37:13.965]  In other words, we're not going to just set up cameras outside or a projector outside of Ground Zero, but it'll be down in lower Manhattan somewhere.
[03:37:13.985 --> 03:37:18.828]  Okay, I'm going to try to get there tonight before the fireworks.
[03:37:18.888 --> 03:37:31.197]  What I wanted to talk about is Gore Vidal's excellent interview with the Iranian press that was published on Saturday, the 28th.
[03:37:32.911 --> 03:37:34.853]  And it's really, it's entitled, The U.S.
[03:37:34.913 --> 03:37:36.314]  Is Not a Republic Anymore.
[03:37:37.135 --> 03:37:39.156]  It really means that the U.S.
[03:37:39.216 --> 03:37:41.659]  is not a constitutional republic anymore.
[03:37:42.059 --> 03:37:50.226]  And it's an excellent interview with very succinct comments that Gore Vidal has been making over the last 20 years.
[03:37:50.666 --> 03:37:54.870]  But it's so cogent that I think everyone should read it.
[03:37:55.010 --> 03:37:58.813]  And I'm not at all surprised that the New York Times nor the Washington Post
[03:38:00.178 --> 03:38:03.440]  They chose not to run the story, but it's one of the best.
[03:38:03.520 --> 03:38:05.380]  It's been getting lots of airplay in England.
[03:38:05.400 --> 03:38:12.183]  In fact, it was actually in the Times on Sunday in London.
[03:38:12.283 --> 03:38:13.864]  So, I mean, it's really interesting.
[03:38:13.904 --> 03:38:18.585]  The only people that seem to not know what's happening are those here in the States.
[03:38:18.725 --> 03:38:20.886]  And I don't mean the people listening to your show.
[03:38:21.386 --> 03:38:27.909]  But what I wanted to say, too, is that I also wanted to thank Kucinich and also Professor Boyle
[03:38:28.274 --> 03:38:31.896]  Who has been working on articles of impeachment since 2003.
[03:38:32.796 --> 03:38:37.899]  And I think it's time that we hold our Congress and our Senators accountable.
[03:38:38.279 --> 03:38:45.083]  And we demand that Bush be tried for his crimes against the American people, American treaties, and the Constitution.
[03:38:45.123 --> 03:38:57.750]  And if we are too panty-waisted to bring Bush to trial with impeachment and his wartime cabinet, including the Vice President, I think it's time that we extradite him to the Hague to stand trial.
[03:38:59.667 --> 03:39:06.609]  I'm with you on many levels.
[03:39:06.649 --> 03:39:11.411]  I don't know about The Hague, but I do want people to go to Cassinich.us right now.
[03:39:11.471 --> 03:39:13.331]  Did you hear that Cassinich clip earlier today?
[03:39:13.391 --> 03:39:13.731]  I do.
[03:39:13.751 --> 03:39:18.213]  The only reason why I'm stating The Hague is when our own system fails to act.
[03:39:18.853 --> 03:39:21.154]  There have been over a million people murdered.
[03:39:21.676 --> 03:39:28.267]  by this illegal criminal bush regime and it's time to hold them accountable in the far congress can't enforce its own laws
[03:39:28.789 --> 03:39:35.952]  Then let's extradite him and let the world court try him for his crimes, or let the Iraqi people try him and his wartime cabinet.
[03:39:36.112 --> 03:39:37.493]  I think that has to be done.
[03:39:37.553 --> 03:39:38.693]  Thank you, Matt.
[03:39:38.713 --> 03:39:39.894]  Thank you, Matt.
[03:39:39.934 --> 03:39:45.256]  You know, I'm just very, very hesitant to bring anything to a world tribunal because I don't trust the UN.
[03:39:45.657 --> 03:39:49.658]  If the world tribunals were so great, we would have had trials in the first year after 9-11.
[03:39:49.758 --> 03:39:51.579]  We would have had a real investigation.
[03:39:51.619 --> 03:39:52.980]  I really think that we have to do this.
[03:39:53.480 --> 03:39:59.502]  From a homegrown perspective, Kacinich.us, Kacinich.us, Kacinich.us.
[03:39:59.863 --> 03:40:07.846]  Go to Kacinich.us right now and sign this petition to get these articles on the fast track to reality.
[03:40:08.066 --> 03:40:09.366]  He already put them before the House.
[03:40:09.446 --> 03:40:10.326]  Congress is aware.
[03:40:10.447 --> 03:40:11.007]  They don't care.
[03:40:11.287 --> 03:40:12.887]  They think the people are just going to fall asleep.
[03:40:13.027 --> 03:40:17.089]  They're going to lie on their backs in their little fetal position and be like, oh, I can't do anything.
[03:40:17.329 --> 03:40:17.929]  Do something.
[03:40:18.189 --> 03:40:18.770]  Kacinich.us.
[03:40:19.910 --> 03:40:23.292]  Go and sign the petition right away.
[03:40:23.492 --> 03:40:24.592]  Alright, let's take another call.
[03:40:24.612 --> 03:40:26.573]  Let's go to John in Michigan.
[03:40:26.613 --> 03:40:27.534]  John, how are you today?
[03:40:28.934 --> 03:40:29.955]  Yeah, excuse me.
[03:40:30.635 --> 03:40:31.095]  What's your name?
[03:40:31.155 --> 03:40:31.615]  I'm sorry.
[03:40:31.696 --> 03:40:32.356]  I'm Jason, man.
[03:40:32.396 --> 03:40:33.816]  Jason, yeah.
[03:40:34.157 --> 03:40:37.138]  Look, I live in a little town just outside of Detroit.
[03:40:37.898 --> 03:40:42.540]  I want to let you know that the blacks here are actually starting to take to the streets.
[03:40:43.041 --> 03:40:43.321]  Good.
[03:40:43.541 --> 03:40:45.682]  They do not walk out in the sidewalk anymore.
[03:40:46.423 --> 03:40:51.327]  And what I'm figuring is, there's been a lot of rainy weather here in power outages everywhere except Detroit.
[03:40:52.367 --> 03:40:57.531]  But if there were to be a power outage in Detroit for a couple hours, we'd have 1967 and more all over again, I know it.
[03:40:57.551 --> 03:40:59.292]  That's why I'm letting you know that.
[03:40:59.712 --> 03:41:02.594]  You really think it's that politically charged out there in Detroit right now?
[03:41:02.614 --> 03:41:04.656]  I don't know about the political side, but they're angry.
[03:41:04.676 --> 03:41:07.258]  They're angry over their status, you know.
[03:41:09.139 --> 03:41:17.005]  Well, I mean, back in the 80s, Detroit was a huge industrial town, had a lot of jobs everywhere, and that slowly was taken away.
[03:41:17.065 --> 03:41:22.909]  That was Michael Moore's first movie, Roger and Me, and then now, I mean, there's not much there, is there?
[03:41:23.230 --> 03:41:34.939]  Like I said, you know, there's been power outages everywhere except Detroit, but about two, three hours in Detroit, it would start, because they know the alarm batteries would be gone, and even UPS batteries would be gone, you know, for the computer backup.
[03:41:35.659 --> 03:41:36.680]  So that all makes sense.
[03:41:37.225 --> 03:41:37.685]  All right, man.
[03:41:37.745 --> 03:41:38.646]  I thank you for the call, John.
[03:41:38.666 --> 03:41:40.867]  Let's jump to Betty in North Carolina.
[03:41:41.227 --> 03:41:41.927]  Betty, what's up?
[03:41:43.748 --> 03:41:44.589]  Hi, Jason.
[03:41:44.849 --> 03:41:45.269]  How are you?
[03:41:45.929 --> 03:41:46.890]  I'm doing okay.
[03:41:48.010 --> 03:41:59.916]  I wanted to call and let you know that I went on, tried to get on Dick Kucinich's website and I can't pull it up because I was going to vote for that.
[03:42:00.116 --> 03:42:00.356]  Yep.
[03:42:00.996 --> 03:42:06.299]  And also, too, I've been getting emails sent to me about Bush's impeachment.
[03:42:06.656 --> 03:42:07.697]  We're good to go.
[03:42:22.350 --> 03:42:24.993]  And I think you guys are doing a great job.
[03:42:41.604 --> 03:42:44.865]  The whole oil scenario and why we need to impeach Bush.
[03:42:44.945 --> 03:42:47.446]  And Betty, I thank you so much for your support with the movies.
[03:42:47.486 --> 03:42:49.586]  I hope that you make copies and hand them out to friends.
[03:42:49.646 --> 03:42:56.648]  And I hope that all of you listeners, listen again, all of you listeners, go to kucinich.us, sign this petition, support them.
[03:42:56.668 --> 03:42:57.968]  We've got a big weekend ahead of us.
[03:42:58.469 --> 03:42:59.729]  Okay, this is Independence Day.
[03:43:00.211 --> 03:43:01.633]  You're going to be talking to your family.
[03:43:02.013 --> 03:43:09.302]  If your family is just as upset as you, or they don't know why they're upset, but they still think things are wrong, point them to Kucinich.us.
[03:43:09.482 --> 03:43:11.184]  We need as many signatures as possible.
[03:43:11.544 --> 03:43:13.146]  I mean, this thing should be all over the news.
[03:43:13.446 --> 03:43:13.867]  It's not.
[03:43:14.147 --> 03:43:15.168]  You don't see it on CNN.
[03:43:15.188 --> 03:43:16.390]  You don't see it on Fox News.
[03:43:16.670 --> 03:43:18.291]  You don't see it on MSNBC.
[03:43:18.591 --> 03:43:21.972]  You don't see it on any flavor of the news because they want to keep this silent.
[03:43:21.992 --> 03:43:30.994]  They don't want you to know that a congressman who's now run for president twice in this country is trying to impeach Bush on 35 counts.
[03:43:32.135 --> 03:43:32.755]  35 different articles.
[03:43:32.795 --> 03:43:33.575]  He's charged him.
[03:43:34.035 --> 03:43:34.775]  It's unbelievable.
[03:43:35.516 --> 03:43:37.056]  Alright, let's go to Hartwell in Louisiana.
[03:43:37.076 --> 03:43:37.716]  Hartwell, what's up?
[03:43:39.577 --> 03:43:39.917]  You with us?
[03:43:40.546 --> 03:43:47.890]  Yes, Jason, I'm calling to let you know that on this Independence Day I am not barbecuing, I'm not drinking beer, and I'm not looking for ball games.
[03:43:47.991 --> 03:43:51.933]  What I'm looking for is information, the information that you're giving.
[03:43:52.443 --> 03:43:55.526]  And I'm calling to thank you so much for being there for me.
[03:43:56.006 --> 03:43:57.127]  May God bless you.
[03:44:14.222 --> 03:44:27.252]  But we can't do that every day, and I really feel like the general populace is out there in this daze, just not caring what's going on, just living day-to-day in a total and complete haze, almost a false reality, if you will, Harwell.
[03:44:27.912 --> 03:44:29.734]  Yes.
[03:44:30.774 --> 03:44:33.897]  Well, I spent $500 burning a professional DVD burner.
[03:44:33.957 --> 03:44:35.338]  I burned four at one time.
[03:44:35.692 --> 03:44:36.653]  Oh, good, good, good.
[03:44:36.793 --> 03:44:38.474]  And I am doing it.
[03:44:38.935 --> 03:44:39.215]  Awesome.
[03:44:39.615 --> 03:44:39.875]  Awesome.
[03:44:39.895 --> 03:44:42.698]  That is good news and I hope you hand out thousands of those discs.
[03:44:42.998 --> 03:44:47.382]  And I know you're in Louisiana, but maybe you can make it out to New York this year for September 11th.
[03:44:47.402 --> 03:44:50.224]  The more of you that can make it out, the better the impact will be.
[03:44:50.504 --> 03:44:51.385]  I thank you for the call.
[03:44:51.705 --> 03:44:54.147]  Let's jump to Wade in Mississippi.
[03:44:54.587 --> 03:44:56.869]  Wade, how's your Independence Day going so far, buddy?
[03:44:57.530 --> 03:44:58.450]  So far, so good.
[03:44:58.490 --> 03:45:03.134]  I'm at work in beautiful southwestern Louisiana, but I live in Mississippi.
[03:45:04.420 --> 03:45:10.943]  I want to call and wish y'all a happy Independence Day, and thank you for the work that you've done on 9-11 loose change.
[03:45:11.603 --> 03:45:13.144]  All three films, I've watched all three.
[03:45:13.184 --> 03:45:31.492]  I just watched 9-11 Truth Rising last night, and all I gotta say is it really does the best job of saying what the real issue is in getting at the first responders, because I myself was a firefighter before 9-11 in Mississippi, and I participated in Hurricane Katrina's
[03:45:32.990 --> 03:45:35.472]  Recovery efforts and everything in the Mississippi Gulf Coast.
[03:45:35.912 --> 03:45:41.016]  But moving on to Dennis Kucinich's 35 articles of impeachment.
[03:45:42.251 --> 03:45:46.833]  One article of impeachment stands out to be the nail in the coffin.
[03:45:46.873 --> 03:45:48.873]  This is guaranteed 100%.
[03:45:49.734 --> 03:45:52.435]  Congress should be lynching the White House on this.
[03:45:53.395 --> 03:46:00.417]  Bush went to war without Congress' approval or formal declaration of war saying, yes, we can go invade a foreign country.
[03:46:00.817 --> 03:46:01.858]  That violates our U.S.
[03:46:01.938 --> 03:46:04.999]  Constitution and anybody that doesn't understand that
[03:46:05.763 --> 03:46:07.904]  Obviously, didn't pay attention in history class.
[03:46:08.104 --> 03:46:13.308]  Well, absolutely, and it's all wordplay, because we're not really at war with Iraq.
[03:46:13.368 --> 03:46:29.857]  It is a conflict, but they can sit there up on a podium and say we're at war, we're at war, we're at war, we're at war, when war is never actually declared, and it's just a conflict that can last forever, and basically allow us to do anything outside of our own international and national rules.
[03:46:30.338 --> 03:46:33.399]  It's absolute ludicrous, and I agree 110% with you, but I think
[03:46:34.620 --> 03:46:36.321]  You know, there's some other solid ones in there.
[03:46:36.361 --> 03:46:39.644]  I mean, for instance, the domestic wiretapping they've had to admit to.
[03:46:39.984 --> 03:46:51.151]  I mean, that one AT&T whistleblower alone has blown the lid off the fact that the National Security Agency clones almost all information from emails to phone calls and puts it into a database.
[03:46:51.471 --> 03:46:52.612]  I mean, that's scary stuff.
[03:46:52.632 --> 03:46:54.774]  And this was in place before 9-11.
[03:46:54.814 --> 03:46:56.955]  This is one of the other articles of impeachment.
[03:46:57.195 --> 03:46:57.435]  You know?
[03:46:58.096 --> 03:46:59.777]  It's absolutely amazing.
[03:47:00.317 --> 03:47:02.039]  And, you know, being a first responder, my
[03:47:03.234 --> 03:47:04.694]  Experience with Hurricane Katrina.
[03:47:04.714 --> 03:47:07.655]  I'm a search and rescue coordinator for Hancock County, Mississippi.
[03:47:07.935 --> 03:47:15.096]  So if we have another hurricane, I'm the guy that's got to deal with FEMA and getting the USAR teams to come down and coordinate the rescue efforts.
[03:47:15.536 --> 03:47:19.937]  But they just had a press release that said FEMA's not going to give anybody any ice.
[03:47:19.997 --> 03:47:25.098]  And ice was very critical in the survival in the immediate days of the aftermath of the storm.
[03:47:25.438 --> 03:47:28.059]  Because people have prescriptions that they have to keep.
[03:47:28.499 --> 03:47:31.463]  Cold, and not just that, the food that's in the refrigerators.
[03:47:31.743 --> 03:47:41.274]  If you could take a little bit of food that's in your refrigerator that you lost power, put it in an ice chest with some fresh ice, you can keep it a week or two in that ice chest as long as you have a constant supply of ice.
[03:47:41.735 --> 03:47:47.322]  But I know now that I've been reading and doing research on FEMA, doing online courses with FEMA, independent study,
[03:47:47.862 --> 03:47:53.889]  FEMA wants every emergency management agency throughout the entire United States to comply with them.
[03:47:53.909 --> 03:48:00.557]  It's basically where FEMA is leading the way saying you have to do what we tell you to do or you're not going to be involved.
[03:48:00.718 --> 03:48:06.825]  They have a five-year training matrix and you go to FEMA.gov and read all about it that says that you have to be trained
[03:48:07.679 --> 03:48:08.380]  To be compliant.
[03:48:08.400 --> 03:48:11.602]  If you're not compliant, you can't participate in emergency management.
[03:48:11.743 --> 03:48:12.463]  Well, that's what FEMA's all about.
[03:48:12.483 --> 03:48:13.804]  And it's basically weeding out all the people.
[03:48:13.945 --> 03:48:15.426]  Yeah, I mean, it's all about control.
[03:48:15.466 --> 03:48:17.608]  It's all about doing what the elite want to do.
[03:48:17.648 --> 03:48:20.010]  That's why it's part of the continuity of government program.
[03:48:20.270 --> 03:48:27.156]  In case they just want to declare that we no longer have a constitutional government like they did on 9-11, FEMA will step in and do what it has to do.
[03:48:27.196 --> 03:48:32.621]  You know, that's why they let Halliburton build all those FEMA camps throughout the country privately with no-bid contracts.
[03:48:32.921 --> 03:48:33.361]  It's because...
[03:48:34.362 --> 03:48:39.504]  Look at KBR and how Burton had the contract to build all them railcars for the FEMA camps.
[03:48:39.664 --> 03:48:39.844]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:48:39.864 --> 03:48:47.968]  In fact, it's financed by the federal government, and there's several videos available on the internet about how we have concentration camps in the United States that are funded by FEMA.
[03:48:48.268 --> 03:48:51.409]  Yeah, and they have all these little portable coffins, if you will.
[03:48:51.449 --> 03:48:53.470]  They could probably fit two or three bodies in these plastics.
[03:48:53.550 --> 03:48:56.010]  I just wanted to tell people about a new website I made.
[03:48:56.090 --> 03:48:56.731]  It's Global911Truth.com.
[03:49:20.837 --> 03:49:23.699]  And I'm also from TorontoChange.com.
[03:49:23.719 --> 03:49:24.660]  We are Change Toronto.
[03:49:24.980 --> 03:49:25.400]  Excellent.
[03:49:25.721 --> 03:49:34.147]  Just wanted to let people know, if they're in the Toronto area, or even anywhere in Canada, you've got to watch Unfair Dealing.
[03:49:34.727 --> 03:49:38.770]  And that deals with Toronto 18, the Muslims that they arrested in 2006.
[03:49:39.210 --> 03:49:47.516]  And it's a must-see for any Canadian to see how CSIS did some really dirty dealings there.
[03:49:47.596 --> 03:49:49.598]  Throw out the website one more time.
[03:49:50.365 --> 03:49:54.547]  It's TorontoChange.com and you can check out Global911Truth.com as well.
[03:49:54.807 --> 03:49:56.267]  Alright Rich, thanks so much for the call.
[03:49:56.287 --> 03:49:58.228]  Let's jump to Mark in California.
[03:49:58.268 --> 03:49:58.968]  Mark, are you with us?
[03:49:59.709 --> 03:50:00.849]  Yeah, hey Jason.
[03:50:00.869 --> 03:50:06.711]  I just wanted to give you a success story from someone I work with.
[03:50:07.131 --> 03:50:08.552]  Awesome.
[03:50:08.792 --> 03:50:11.433]  Someone a couple years ago, about three years ago, I gave a
[03:50:12.240 --> 03:50:14.881]  Alex Jones interview with Stanley Hilton.
[03:50:15.102 --> 03:50:16.202]  I think you remember that one.
[03:50:16.222 --> 03:50:19.003]  Yes, Stanley Hilton was the former chief of staff of Bob Dolan.
[03:50:19.023 --> 03:50:20.564]  We'll talk about that on the other side.
[03:50:20.584 --> 03:50:26.307]  He was one of the first guys to go public and put out a lawsuit into the criminal activity of our U.S.
[03:50:26.347 --> 03:50:27.848]  government involved in 9-11.
[03:50:28.168 --> 03:50:29.028]  We'll come back to Mark.
[03:50:29.068 --> 03:50:33.391]  Remember, it's Independence Day and the truth is rising over at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:50:45.441 --> 03:50:48.042]  Listener, ask yourself, can I be deceived?
[03:50:48.342 --> 03:50:52.523]  Matthew 24 states four times, in the last days many will be deceived.
[03:50:52.743 --> 03:50:56.024]  There are many ideas about the mark of the beast and the antichrist.
[03:50:56.304 --> 03:50:59.705]  What do you know about the beast, its mark, and the antichrist?
[03:51:00.065 --> 03:51:03.586]  Is the beast a superpower nation or a giant computer in Belgium?
[03:51:03.986 --> 03:51:05.428]  Is its mark an implanted chip?
[03:51:05.708 --> 03:51:06.269]  A tattoo?
[03:51:06.509 --> 03:51:07.751]  The National ID Card?
[03:51:07.931 --> 03:51:08.051]  Or 666?
[03:51:09.273 --> 03:51:11.896]  Is the Antichrist a person, title, or both?
[03:51:12.257 --> 03:51:13.899]  Some believe these things are in the future.
[03:51:14.179 --> 03:51:15.641]  Others believe that it's in the past.
[03:51:16.161 --> 03:51:19.185]  1 John states, The Antichrist is already in the world.
[03:51:19.466 --> 03:51:20.146]  What is the truth?
[03:51:20.387 --> 03:51:21.268]  And what is a lie?
[03:51:21.588 --> 03:51:23.630]  Are you willing to search God's Word for the truth?
[03:51:23.930 --> 03:51:25.691]  Friends, these answers are in the Bible.
[03:51:25.951 --> 03:51:33.938]  For free books, DVDs, and Bible studies exposing the Antichrist, the Beast, and its mark, write to The Bible Says, Box 99, Lenore City, Tennessee, 37771.

[03:54:41.797 --> 03:54:45.958]  We're encouraging people to do that as well, so that they can make copies and hand those out.
[03:54:46.419 --> 03:54:56.183]  Right now, we're talking to Mark in California, and he was talking about how he led his friend into the Stanley Hilton situation, and Stanley Hilton was a former Chief of Staff for Bob Dole.
[03:54:57.177 --> 03:55:10.647]  Yeah, well, Jason, you know, I had what I would perceive as a normal reaction to hearing the Stanley Hippelman interview on the show, and I distributed it to a few of my friends, and one of them was someone I was working with at the time of the interview.
[03:55:24.754 --> 03:55:35.996]  Subsequently, he went to another job, and I should say, at the time, he told me I was crazy, I was a nut for, you know, even handing him the audio compact disc.
[03:55:36.896 --> 03:55:53.199]  And so anyway, a couple years go by, and he's recently come back to the company that I work for, and out of nowhere, he starts basically describing to me Terror Storm and a couple other internet videos that he'd seen.
[03:55:54.057 --> 03:56:11.065]  It changed his perspective and he jumped out of the typical left-right mindset and jumped into our world of, holy mackerel, there's all kinds of stuff going on that we're being lied to about.
[03:56:12.626 --> 03:56:14.507]  So, I don't know if it was
[03:56:14.983 --> 03:56:21.248]  Not necessarily, you know, my giving him the audio CD a couple years ago.
[03:56:21.288 --> 03:56:23.330]  Well, I guarantee that was the start of it, man.
[03:56:23.450 --> 03:56:26.593]  Listen, you plant these seeds, they don't always bloom right away.
[03:56:26.713 --> 03:56:27.334]  Sometimes they do.
[03:56:27.374 --> 03:56:29.335]  Some people are smart enough to pick up on it.
[03:56:29.355 --> 03:56:31.977]  Some people are like, oh my God, and then they want more information.
[03:56:32.218 --> 03:56:34.860]  Other people, it sits back in the back of their mind forever.
[03:56:35.330 --> 03:56:36.810]  And then all of a sudden there's a trigger.
[03:56:37.051 --> 03:56:39.111]  And that's why I don't give up on my friends and family.
[03:56:39.131 --> 03:56:41.472]  That's why I've been pushing this stuff even when I go home.
[03:56:41.512 --> 03:56:52.775]  That's why I gave, you know, my Republican friend who got married in New York last week, you know, 12 different movies, including, you know, Alex Jones's movies, my movies, American Drug War, because we can wake them up.
[03:56:52.835 --> 03:56:53.696]  We can keep pushing.
[03:56:53.716 --> 03:56:55.596]  They're not going to call us nuts forever.
[03:56:55.696 --> 03:56:59.497]  Something's going to happen in their life that's going to trigger them to this information.
[03:56:59.537 --> 03:57:00.578]  They're going to join our fight.
[03:57:00.618 --> 03:57:01.478]  I truly believe that.
[03:57:02.466 --> 03:57:22.215]  It seems to me that the 9-1-1 Truth Rising, which I've watched three times already, shows the other side doing just a series of ad hominem attacks against people that are simply quoting stories that they've seen in the mainstream press.
[03:57:22.235 --> 03:57:31.799]  It seems like they always get back on their heels and they just resort to name-calling or saying, you know, get a life.
[03:57:32.339 --> 03:57:33.620]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:57:33.640 --> 03:57:35.541]  Let's go through some of the talking points that are in the movie.
[03:57:35.861 --> 03:57:37.281]  Oh, they're not going to be nice forever.
[03:57:37.621 --> 03:57:39.422]  What's going to stop them from being tased?
[03:57:39.462 --> 03:57:40.283]  They're terrorists.
[03:57:40.943 --> 03:57:42.744]  But in actuality, we're the Patriots.
[03:57:43.204 --> 03:57:45.225]  And I'm glad you've watched it almost three times, man.
[03:57:45.265 --> 03:57:46.225]  That's very encouraging.
[03:57:46.265 --> 03:57:47.666]  That tells me that this is a good movie.
[03:57:47.706 --> 03:57:49.407]  I hope that you make copies and you hand them out.
[03:57:49.627 --> 03:57:50.767]  I thank you for the call, Mark.
[03:57:51.488 --> 03:57:53.008]  Guys, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:53.629 --> 03:57:56.150]  This is where patriotism is every day.
[03:57:56.810 --> 03:57:59.171]  In fact, it's Independence Day on this show 365 days a year.
[03:58:01.443 --> 03:58:05.605]  If you missed any of this big-time broadcast, remember PrisonPlanet.TV.

[03:58:35.792 --> 03:58:41.256]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[03:58:41.536 --> 03:58:42.837]  And we knew what to do.
[03:58:42.857 --> 03:58:44.618]  Or at least we thought we did.
[03:58:44.859 --> 03:58:51.264]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[03:58:51.904 --> 03:58:57.048]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement
[03:58:58.015 --> 03:59:00.437]  That the air was safe to breathe.
[03:59:00.778 --> 03:59:07.584]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[03:59:07.884 --> 03:59:10.927]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[03:59:11.047 --> 03:59:16.212]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[03:59:16.812 --> 03:59:19.474]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[03:59:19.894 --> 03:59:25.758]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[03:59:25.938 --> 03:59:28.500]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[03:59:28.860 --> 03:59:33.884]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[03:59:39.628 --> 03:59:41.289]  Thank you for listening to GCA.
[03:59:45.246 --> 03:59:47.358]  Eugenics dominated the 20th century.
[03:59:47.982 --> 03:59:48.948]  It's ruthless spirit
