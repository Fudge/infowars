[00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.494]  We offer a real solution using real science.
[00:00:03.874 --> 00:00:07.719]  Our unique approach to cancer treatment is what everyone has been waiting for.
[00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:11.164]  A simple, easy way to eliminate the threat of cancer.
[00:00:11.464 --> 00:00:13.467]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:00:22.691 --> 00:00:31.334]  Congressman Ron Paul is our guest as the big rally for the Republic coming up in just about three and a half weeks.
[00:00:31.894 --> 00:00:37.796]  I'll tell you about that before he leaves us and some of the amazing speakers and people that are going to be on the list.
[00:00:39.778 --> 00:00:58.745]  Congressman, finishing up with the economy, the mainstream media gets the public to focus in on what's happening with oil or gold or inflation day-to-day, instead of looking at the year-long and decade-long graphs where gold's going straight up, oil's going straight up, every commodity's going straight up, the dollar's going straight down.
[00:01:00.706 --> 00:01:08.308]  You talked a few weeks ago about something really big on the economic front coming that would, quote, put our liberties into deep freeze.
[00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:23.213]  Can you flesh that out for us and give us more specifics with your economic outlook, studying economics and being on the Banking Committee on where we're going, looking at the current economic landscape and what the Private Federal Reserve is saying?
[00:01:24.434 --> 00:01:32.863]  Well, what I'm thinking about is the tremendous dislocation of capital that has occurred over the last 35 years since the Bretton Woods Agreement broke down.
[00:01:32.883 --> 00:01:35.045]  We've had nothing but a world fiat currency.
[00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:42.364]  And it's already well into the correction, but I think it has a long way to go.
[00:01:42.964 --> 00:01:46.887]  And that is, we've literally pumped in hundreds of billions of dollars.
[00:01:47.247 --> 00:01:53.131]  You know, they talked about the housing bill last week when that was finally passed, and it's open-ended.
[00:01:53.171 --> 00:01:56.654]  They pretend it's $25 billion, but the Secretary of the Treasury
[00:01:57.354 --> 00:02:02.700]  Actually has license to buy up all the securities relating to mortgages.
[00:02:03.221 --> 00:02:06.704]  So he has no restraint and he can do that without coming back to Congress.
[00:02:07.285 --> 00:02:12.951]  But if you look at what the Fed has already done, they've pumped in hundreds of billions of dollars already.
[00:02:13.641 --> 00:02:16.322]  And the market really hasn't discounted that at all.
[00:02:16.442 --> 00:02:24.005]  I saw an article that said that if another country had even hinted to our debt, their currency would have been wiped out immediately.
[00:02:24.065 --> 00:02:25.925]  It would have been so disastrous.
[00:02:26.405 --> 00:02:33.268]  And yet there's so much illogical trust placed in the dollar still, even though it's being lost and it's going down.
[00:02:33.288 --> 00:02:40.130]  I think someday somebody's going to wake up and say, you know, this dollar is a fraud and they're going to leave the dollar.
[00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:48.906]  And the reason I think about this in light of our foreign policy is, you know, there's still a bunch of people in Washington that want to go and bomb Iran.
[00:02:49.326 --> 00:02:59.874]  If they do that, I mean, just the psychology of this and the pressure on the military and the pressure on the oil and everything, that would be the precipitating event I see.
[00:03:00.647 --> 00:03:08.030]  As a financial collapse, and when you have that, you have a political crisis, and I just happen to believe we're vulnerable.
[00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.691]  It's just that I don't have a timetable.
[00:03:10.711 --> 00:03:19.655]  I can't say next week it's going to happen or next month, but I do believe it's going to happen unless we wake up, and right now it doesn't look like we're waking up very fast.
[00:03:20.322 --> 00:03:25.503]  The Federal Reserve has signaled for years they plan to just print more money, issue more liquidity.
[00:03:25.983 --> 00:03:35.325]  Now Barack Obama proposed Saturday a $150 billion or $1,000 credit per U.S.
[00:03:35.385 --> 00:03:42.007]  citizen for increasing energy costs, but that's again borrowing from the private
[00:03:42.387 --> 00:03:55.611]  Bankers again and borrowing from foreign countries again, instead of fixing the problems we have with our energy system of not enough refineries and not allowing drilling in places like Anwar and Alaska.
[00:03:55.932 --> 00:04:02.734]  Congressman, what's your take on Barack Obama wanting a $150 billion energy check to be sent out to the American people?
[00:04:03.564 --> 00:04:05.485]  Well, it's just more of the same.
[00:04:05.525 --> 00:04:08.067]  It should send shutters through the market.
[00:04:08.127 --> 00:04:20.276]  I mean, in time, that is what will push up gold and the dollar down, but the immediate results haven't been that way because, of course, he's not president yet, and they may well do that later.
[00:04:20.696 --> 00:04:22.297]  The markets are sort of fickle.
[00:04:22.397 --> 00:04:27.561]  Sometimes they react immediately in the wrong direction, then they finally wake up and they do the other thing.
[00:04:28.081 --> 00:04:38.084]  But this whole notion that Barack Obama has something new and wonderful to offer is just silly talk, and he just has more spending.
[00:04:38.124 --> 00:04:43.346]  But if we could only criticize him and say, ah, the answer is just vote for the Republican.
[00:04:43.846 --> 00:04:47.029]  And the Republicans will say, you know, we can't do that either.
[00:04:47.049 --> 00:04:53.234]  And I think that's what the American people are waking up to, realizing that neither party is offering us any solution.
[00:04:53.294 --> 00:05:01.361]  But this whole idea that we can either appropriate more money or print more money and inflate our way out of it or borrow our way out of it,
[00:05:01.929 --> 00:05:11.412]  That's coming to an end, and I think that's what the American people are sensing, and the frustrations with the American people are way ahead of what's going on in Washington.
[00:05:11.572 --> 00:05:13.693]  A crisis of confidence.
[00:05:14.113 --> 00:05:22.816]  You've always spoken, going back decades, about the fact that once the government started going bankrupt, once the dollar started imploding and eroding because of the policies they
[00:05:23.496 --> 00:05:23.976]  We're good to go.
[00:05:44.588 --> 00:05:50.410]  Well, I can't say for sure, and I don't think anybody knows, but we're getting awfully close to that.
[00:05:50.430 --> 00:06:01.393]  I have concluded that we will not, you know, gradually improve ourselves in Washington, that we get a better Congress and we work our way out of it.
[00:06:13.897 --> 00:06:15.218]  In theory, you could do that.
[00:06:15.238 --> 00:06:19.020]  If you did the right things, you'd suffer a bit, but we could work our way out of it.
[00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:28.085]  I think we're going to continue to have the politicians always do the bailouts, as well as Treasury and as well as the Federal Reserve, which means that we will come to a crisis.
[00:06:28.145 --> 00:06:40.952]  And the question is, is what you bring up, will there be enough of us to pick up the pieces, or will the authoritarians who ruined the system come in and hold it together just by more brute force?
[00:06:41.532 --> 00:06:42.793]  And history says that
[00:06:43.832 --> 00:06:45.153]  I don't think so.
[00:07:01.668 --> 00:07:05.691]  Well, Congressman, we're gearing up to educate the public peacefully.
[00:07:05.731 --> 00:07:12.976]  Meanwhile, the authoritarians in all their major white papers, Defense Department, Ministry of Defense in England, they admit they're gearing up to counter the people
[00:07:22.802 --> 00:07:27.945]  Who don't want to go into bondage and third-world serfdom in this whole high-tech overlay.
[00:07:28.245 --> 00:07:38.970]  And so clearly, the enemy of liberty understands that and is gearing up with propaganda, militarily, police-wise, to oppress the people.
[00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:51.176]  Can you speak to that in this latest example of where they've just announced, without warrants, they're going to seize everybody's computers, they've already started it at the border, and send them off for months for them to download the contents of your laptop?
[00:07:52.637 --> 00:07:54.539]  Or your iPhone?
[00:07:55.741 --> 00:07:59.945]  And then they're having quote private corporations who are sharing the data?
[00:08:00.185 --> 00:08:02.248]  I mean it's a race towards Orwell!
[00:08:03.086 --> 00:08:05.487]  Yeah, and it's always, you know, for good reasons.
[00:08:05.567 --> 00:08:12.650]  I mean, somebody coming into this, they start with the borders, and they say, well, you might be a terrorist, so we have to know what's in everybody's computer.
[00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:15.611]  So it's always playing on this, we're going to take care of you.
[00:08:16.031 --> 00:08:21.673]  But just think of all these lists and ID badges and everything else that they want to have, national ID cards.
[00:08:22.014 --> 00:08:25.275]  It's always done to keep out the illegals.
[00:08:25.735 --> 00:08:29.096]  And yet, at the same time, we know that they're not very serious about that.
[00:08:29.497 --> 00:08:32.758]  But, you know, some person one time said,
[00:08:33.118 --> 00:08:42.985]  You know, maybe we ought to do better at the borders to keep illegals out, but if we have too many fences, it may be that those fences are going to be used to keep us all in.
[00:08:43.005 --> 00:08:47.888]  And the borders, I don't believe them being very serious about protecting our borders.
[00:08:47.928 --> 00:08:51.331]  Every time they pretend to protect the borders, I get very worried.
[00:08:51.351 --> 00:09:01.298]  This whole idea that they're going to cease computers at the border without a search warrant means, although it hasn't happened domestically and it's just starting at the borders,
[00:09:01.798 --> 00:09:09.574]  I mean, we're in for a lot of trouble because everything is more lists on people.
[00:09:09.594 --> 00:09:11.097]  I mean, there are so many databases.
[00:09:11.693 --> 00:09:19.996]  Uh, in Washington, maybe the only saving grace will be that they'll have so much information they won't be able to keep up with and it won't be very efficient.
[00:09:20.296 --> 00:09:22.016]  But in the meantime, they make a lot of mistakes.
[00:09:22.056 --> 00:09:25.897]  Just think about the list they have now on suspected terrorists.
[00:09:26.197 --> 00:09:28.598]  I mean, hundreds of thousands of people on that list.
[00:09:28.898 --> 00:09:30.919]  Once your name gets on there, you can't get it off.
[00:09:30.939 --> 00:09:36.461]  So, so much abuse and so much distrust that exists from this.
[00:09:38.141 --> 00:09:45.463]  What about federal funding for police to go knock on people's doors and, quote, ask to look for illegal guns randomly?
[00:09:45.823 --> 00:09:53.825]  Now the Illinois governor has announced two weeks ago, NBC and Chicago Tribune, that they want to, quote, use the National Guard in anti-gun sweeps.
[00:09:55.105 --> 00:09:57.446]  I mean, it's getting so bad.
[00:09:57.486 --> 00:09:58.306]  What should we do about this?
[00:09:59.062 --> 00:10:02.265]  Well, if it's a state thing, you have to raise a fund.
[00:10:02.325 --> 00:10:05.048]  If it's federal money, of course, we're supposed to take care of that.
[00:10:05.448 --> 00:10:10.373]  But isn't this a perfect example of how the government is being used to destroy our liberties?
[00:10:10.894 --> 00:10:14.197]  And there was a time when it was thought the government was there to protect our liberties.
[00:10:14.878 --> 00:10:17.861]  The government's supposed to be there to make sure you have your Second Amendment.
[00:10:18.241 --> 00:10:21.464]  But here, they're using the government to take your Second Amendment rights away.
[00:10:21.504 --> 00:10:22.005]  What happened?
[00:10:22.365 --> 00:10:25.488]  You know, in Katrina in New Orleans, they went in there and took guns away.
[00:10:25.508 --> 00:10:32.514]  Well, they were supposed to go in there and protect property, which means that you had a right to go to your property, use your own gun and protect it.
[00:10:32.594 --> 00:10:35.436]  But now the government comes in and says, you can't even get on your property.
[00:10:35.796 --> 00:10:37.558]  If you have a gun, we're going to take it away from you.
[00:10:38.178 --> 00:10:42.942]  And why the American people put up with this and they have been doing it for so long, I don't know.
[00:10:43.423 --> 00:10:48.627]  But I do know there's a growing number of individuals like us who are saying enough is enough.
[00:10:51.169 --> 00:10:53.432]  I want to get into the campaign for liberty.
[00:10:53.452 --> 00:10:55.515]  I want to get into the big rally coming up.
[00:10:55.555 --> 00:10:56.816]  The tickets are selling out fast.
[00:10:56.836 --> 00:11:02.503]  Some of the great people that are going to be there like Jesse Ventura and others who, by the way, I talked to this morning about an event we're doing I'll tell you about later, listeners.
[00:11:03.364 --> 00:11:06.008]  Congressman, Iran.
[00:11:06.028 --> 00:11:06.849]  I mean, you're up there.
[00:11:06.889 --> 00:11:08.150]  Last time you were on, you said that
[00:11:09.011 --> 00:11:13.693]  Colleagues of yours are walking around talking about how great it would be to nuke Iran.
[00:11:13.793 --> 00:11:15.754]  Israel is saying they may go in, even if the U.S.
[00:11:15.774 --> 00:11:16.535]  doesn't back it.
[00:11:16.775 --> 00:11:17.735]  We're getting mixed signals.
[00:11:17.775 --> 00:11:27.180]  Barack Obama said last week to the Senate Democrats, hey, if we don't get these sanctions, then there probably is going to be an attack on Iran.
[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.861]  What is the best intel you've got?
[00:11:30.041 --> 00:11:31.662]  Are they planning to hit Iran and win?
[00:11:33.049 --> 00:11:48.021]  Well, I don't know of any precise plans, but I know that the neoconservatives are still in charge in Washington, although every once in a while you'll hear Condoleezza Rice say something and say, oh, maybe she represents the moderates.
[00:11:48.421 --> 00:11:51.964]  But at the same time, she says something like, let's talk to them for a day.
[00:11:52.004 --> 00:11:55.967]  The next day, she said, but remember, nothing is taken off the table.
[00:11:56.447 --> 00:11:59.410]  So the influence is still there that wants it to happen.
[00:12:02.291 --> 00:12:05.833]  They probably themselves don't have a day set to do it.
[00:12:05.873 --> 00:12:10.295]  They're waiting for an opportunity and something will come along.
[00:12:10.936 --> 00:12:13.357]  Whether it happens in the next month or two is still unknown.
[00:12:13.677 --> 00:12:28.545]  But the one thing the American people have to realize is just because on occasion they hear Obama say something that's less aggressive and he wants to maybe bring some troops out of Iraq, you have to remember he's the one that even beat John McCain
[00:12:29.045 --> 00:12:39.389]  In saying we need more troops in Afghanistan and he has never backed away from even a nuclear first strike on Iran because he won't take anything off the table either.
[00:12:40.029 --> 00:12:42.110]  Congressman, we've only got a few minutes left with you.
[00:12:42.811 --> 00:12:56.736]  Specifically, you've warned several times on the House floor and on this radio show about provocations, Gulf of Tonkin style events that almost happened a few months ago in the Strait of Hormuz with the Iranian boats and the fake radio transmission.
[00:12:57.216 --> 00:12:58.417]  Cy Hirsch reported
[00:12:59.057 --> 00:13:01.898]  Two months ago, the White House, quote, wants a provocation.
[00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:05.239]  He got that from inside sources in White House meetings.
[00:13:05.399 --> 00:13:06.199]  You're aware of that.
[00:13:06.219 --> 00:13:26.544]  A, that's A. B, did you know that Keith Olbermann did report Friday that Cy Hirsch has now reported that the White House wanted provocations and Dick Cheney proposed creating fake Iranian patrol boats, putting Navy SEALs in them, and having a shootout between the larger missile cruisers and the Navy SEALs.
[00:13:26.584 --> 00:13:27.344]  Were you aware of that?
[00:13:29.704 --> 00:13:32.305]  Well, I heard that story.
[00:13:32.326 --> 00:13:37.247]  I don't have proof of it, but I believe it's very, very possible.
[00:13:37.307 --> 00:13:43.230]  I mean, this is the kind of... Didn't McCain do something early on about using a U.N.
[00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:46.131]  symbol and hitting it and then blaming it on the Iranians?
[00:13:46.171 --> 00:13:47.872]  They're capable of doing anything!
[00:13:48.892 --> 00:13:51.515]  Well, I tell you what, Congressman, I just skipped the break.
[00:13:51.555 --> 00:13:54.959]  If you can stay with us three more minutes, I will pull Keith Oberman up.
[00:13:55.659 --> 00:13:58.382]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:13:58.402 --> 00:14:00.785]  See, the news moves so fast, it's already off the main page.
[00:14:00.825 --> 00:14:03.347]  No, sir, I'm telling you, Keith Oberman reported on it.
[00:14:03.588 --> 00:14:09.494]  There is a YouTube video of Cy Hersh at a media conference saying that there were a dozen provocations.
[00:14:09.774 --> 00:14:11.336]  He said, I'll only tell you about one.
[00:14:11.796 --> 00:14:16.621]  Dick Cheney proposed but the military shot it down because they didn't want to kill our own troops.
[00:14:16.701 --> 00:14:17.441]  Dick Cheney.
[00:14:17.461 --> 00:14:17.942]  This is huge.
[00:14:17.962 --> 00:14:20.184]  We need your help to look into this and then cover it.
[00:14:21.045 --> 00:14:24.668]  Dick Cheney came right out and said this, sir.
[00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:26.970]  I believe him.
[00:14:27.971 --> 00:14:29.353]  Well, it's just unbelievable.
[00:14:29.393 --> 00:14:30.374]  What should we do about this?
[00:14:31.721 --> 00:14:34.443]  Well, I don't know how much more we can do.
[00:14:34.463 --> 00:14:38.045]  I mean, we have to let the people know first is get knowledge.
[00:14:38.466 --> 00:14:44.970]  Individuals like myself, and we only have a few in Washington, that speak in Washington that try to slow that up.
[00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:50.094]  And you know, in one minor way, I think we did a little bit of good on that.
[00:14:50.994 --> 00:14:56.759]  H. Conrad's 362, I believe, where they were going to put on the absolute blockade of Iran.
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.783]  And we spoke out on that, and that has settled down.
[00:15:01.183 --> 00:15:10.411]  It may still come up, but because several of us spoke out against it, I think they've backed off because they had to admit it really was a blockade.
[00:15:10.991 --> 00:15:15.255]  They proposed that as if, oh no, this is just a few sanctions, this is not really a blockade.
[00:15:15.855 --> 00:15:21.481]  So, we're outnumbered and we're outgunned and that's why it's so dangerous.
[00:15:34.775 --> 00:15:41.202]  Well, you know, the Republicans' convention starts, I think, it's on September 1st and runs for several days.
[00:15:41.923 --> 00:15:46.848]  And we had what many consider the very successful campaign the last year and a half.
[00:15:47.663 --> 00:15:59.994]  And we wanted to conclude it on a very positive note, so it was very clear that we would not be allowed to participate in the Republican Convention, so we decided we would have our own.
[00:16:01.335 --> 00:16:06.700]  And so we're about eight miles from where the Republicans are holding their rally and to campaign for liberty.
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:12.585]  I see the other candidates as campaigning for power, which is exactly opposite of what we do.
[00:16:12.645 --> 00:16:13.906]  We campaign for liberty.
[00:16:14.506 --> 00:16:16.187]  And we want it to be a very positive note.
[00:16:16.207 --> 00:16:22.531]  We're going to have a lot of music, and we're going to have a lot of speakers, and it's going to be talking about the Republic.
[00:16:22.871 --> 00:16:24.692]  It's a rally for the Republic.
[00:16:25.273 --> 00:16:31.377]  And anybody interested should go to CampaignForLiberty.com and join us and come there.
[00:16:31.437 --> 00:16:33.758]  We expect to have a lot of enthusiasm.
[00:16:33.778 --> 00:16:41.623]  We had one reporter call Jesse, our press guy, and said, look, if you guys fill that place, he says, you will be the news for the whole week.
[00:16:42.123 --> 00:16:45.746]  Well, you've already sold more than half the tickets and you've got three weeks to sell the rest.
[00:16:45.806 --> 00:16:47.086]  This is going to be a huge success.
[00:16:59.795 --> 00:17:00.996]  Guaranteed it's going to overflow.
[00:17:01.016 --> 00:17:05.841]  In fact, Jesse told me last week he's already looking for overflow areas for other people nearby.
[00:17:06.661 --> 00:17:10.525]  But, Congressman, let me just play you a minute of this, get your comment on it, and then we'll let you go.
[00:17:10.905 --> 00:17:12.887]  This is world's worst president.
[00:17:13.227 --> 00:17:13.988]  This is Keith Oberman.
[00:17:14.008 --> 00:17:21.675]  Now understand, we have the Cyhurst clip where he lays it out and says we just didn't put it in the newspaper, in the magazine, but here it is.
[00:17:21.955 --> 00:17:24.618]  This is the audio from Friday's Keith Oberman.
[00:17:26.147 --> 00:17:36.052]  He told the Campus Progress Journalism Conference that in a meeting in the Vice President's office, members of the administration sat around brainstorming ideas to provoke a war with Iran.
[00:17:36.172 --> 00:17:44.297]  Quote, the one that interested me the most was, why don't we build, we in our shipyard, build four or five boats that look like Iranian PT boats.
[00:17:44.677 --> 00:17:51.147]  Put navy seals on them with a lot of arms, and the next time one of our boats goes to the Straits of Hormuz, start a shoot-up.
[00:17:51.467 --> 00:17:55.193]  Might cost some lives, and it was rejected because you can't have Americans killing Americans.
[00:17:55.213 --> 00:17:58.197]  That's the kind of, that's the level of stuff we're talking about.
[00:17:58.457 --> 00:18:00.300]  Provocation, but that was rejected.
[00:18:01.001 --> 00:18:02.742]  Can you see this happening in Cheney's office?
[00:18:03.162 --> 00:18:03.902]  Sure you can.
[00:18:04.382 --> 00:18:07.803]  Can you see Cheney getting all happy and worked up and almost smiling?
[00:18:08.343 --> 00:18:09.003]  Sure you can.
[00:18:09.343 --> 00:18:17.206]  Can you see when they get to the part about Americans being killed and you can't do that and he just stares at them all and says, So?
[00:18:17.226 --> 00:18:23.848]  Vice President Dick Cheney, today's worst person in the world!
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:34.149]  Congressman, to me, this is a huge deal, because in the actual clip that I'll email your staff, this is at a major journalism conference in front of hundreds of people and journalists.
[00:18:34.469 --> 00:18:37.292]  He says there were 11 other staged events they planned.
[00:18:37.492 --> 00:18:39.975]  Then we have the White House memo where they wanted to fly the U.S.
[00:18:40.015 --> 00:18:41.556]  planes, painted up like the U.N.
[00:18:41.596 --> 00:18:42.717]  low, to get them shot down.
[00:18:43.058 --> 00:18:46.441]  This is a big deal, and we need to make sure there's an investigation.
[00:18:46.461 --> 00:18:48.343]  We need to know those other 11 targets.
[00:18:48.363 --> 00:18:49.163]  Can you comment on this?
[00:18:49.804 --> 00:18:54.626]  Well, the sad part is that a lot of people won't be surprised.
[00:18:54.706 --> 00:18:57.608]  I imagine you weren't totally surprised.
[00:18:58.568 --> 00:19:01.670]  And that's the really sad part about it, but it is tragic.
[00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:02.310]  It's sad.
[00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:04.771]  And we have to do our very best.
[00:19:04.851 --> 00:19:06.232]  And this exposure is great.
[00:19:06.372 --> 00:19:07.333]  I think this is fine.
[00:19:07.353 --> 00:19:08.973]  Let the people know what's going on.
[00:19:09.053 --> 00:19:14.516]  And maybe they'll wake up when it happens, but I'm afraid to death.
[00:19:14.536 --> 00:19:18.198]  All I have to do is have one of our ships hit.
[00:19:18.698 --> 00:19:22.541]  A bunch of Americans killed, and two news stations up.
[00:19:22.781 --> 00:19:23.662]  It was the Iranians.
[00:19:24.002 --> 00:19:25.604]  The country's going to be ready to go to war.
[00:19:25.844 --> 00:19:29.447]  I mean, they'd be even willing to call a draft and say, well, we have to go.
[00:19:29.467 --> 00:19:31.108]  We have to save Israel.
[00:19:31.148 --> 00:19:32.489]  We have to go and march in.
[00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:33.831]  So we need a draft.
[00:19:34.011 --> 00:19:37.073]  And that's the worst part that I fear.
[00:19:40.477 --> 00:19:43.339]  I guess we have to keep doing what we can do to expose the truth.
[00:19:43.419 --> 00:19:58.251]  Congressman, you don't toot your own horn, but in closing, it was almost two years ago, I know it was in early 2007, I know you gave speeches similar to this even before that, saying, I'm afraid they're going to stage a Gulf of Tonka in the Strait of Hormuz.
[00:19:58.911 --> 00:20:00.312]  Did you get intel on that?
[00:20:00.513 --> 00:20:05.577]  Or are you, I mean, how on earth were you able to predict something like this?
[00:20:06.598 --> 00:20:11.082]  And then now they already tried it with the PT boats a few months ago, with fake radio transmissions.
[00:20:11.143 --> 00:20:15.266]  Now Gary Hart's writing letters to Iran, saying they may stage a Gulf of Tonkin.
[00:20:15.487 --> 00:20:16.748]  I mean, how did you know that?
[00:20:18.278 --> 00:20:20.120]  I didn't absolutely know that.
[00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:23.543]  It just sort of was the fact that they've done it before.
[00:20:23.683 --> 00:20:30.970]  I know what the neocons want, and they did it for Vietnam, and they've done it over the centuries.
[00:20:31.171 --> 00:20:33.293]  You know, the various wars.
[00:20:33.573 --> 00:20:38.938]  So often there seems to be an incident with the Navy and with the ship.
[00:20:39.418 --> 00:20:41.400]  So it must be easier to do it.
[00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:46.464]  So it was just a strong suspicion in relationship to the kind of people that we have running our government.
[00:20:46.524 --> 00:20:51.048]  Well, by exposing it, that takes this tool of staged events and breaks it so they can't use it.
[00:20:51.969 --> 00:20:53.790]  Again, huge guests coming up.
[00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:55.812]  Folks can go buy tickets right now.
[00:20:56.072 --> 00:20:57.393]  You've got several websites.
[00:20:57.853 --> 00:20:59.475]  Is the best one Rally for the Republic?
[00:21:00.433 --> 00:21:01.934]  That or Campaign for Liberty.
[00:21:02.554 --> 00:21:04.835]  And that's rallyfortherepublic.com?
[00:21:05.295 --> 00:21:05.535]  Right.
[00:21:05.995 --> 00:21:07.556]  And the Campaign for Liberty website.
[00:21:07.776 --> 00:21:09.837]  We have links to those up on infowars.com.
[00:21:10.437 --> 00:21:12.658]  Also, Congressman, give us your House website.
[00:21:12.678 --> 00:21:13.719]  Give us some of your other websites.
[00:21:14.974 --> 00:21:25.881]  The best one to go to to look at all my websites would be RonPaul.org, and it lists about six websites, the political websites, and the PAC website, and the different things, and the educational website.
[00:21:25.941 --> 00:21:27.722]  RonPaul.org for all the websites.
[00:21:27.782 --> 00:21:30.824]  Okay, that's the big portal to all the world of Ron Paul and liberty.
[00:21:31.184 --> 00:21:33.846]  Thank you so much for your tireless efforts to defend freedom.
[00:21:33.866 --> 00:21:41.891]  I know you're going to be popping in for about five minutes later in the week to make that big announcement we were going to make today, but Jesse Ventura, many others at the event, get your tickets now.
[00:21:41.971 --> 00:21:43.012]  Congressman, thank you.
[00:21:43.752 --> 00:21:44.332]  Thanks for having me.
[00:21:44.553 --> 00:21:44.933]  You bet.
[00:21:45.433 --> 00:21:48.355]  Well, that was a bombshell interview, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:48.655 --> 00:21:51.297]  And it's only going to get more powerful after this break.
[00:21:51.457 --> 00:21:53.358]  Prison Planet is now censored by the British government.
[00:21:53.618 --> 00:21:54.519]  We're on the march.
[00:21:54.999 --> 00:21:56.620]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:57.661 --> 00:21:59.282]  All right, Paul Watson is all set.
[00:22:01.001 --> 00:22:01.361]  What's that?
[00:22:01.781 --> 00:22:03.542]  The world of Ron Paul and Liberty.
[00:22:03.903 --> 00:22:06.564]  Thank you so much for your tireless efforts to defend freedom.
[00:22:06.584 --> 00:22:14.609]  I know you're going to be popping in for about five minutes later in the week to make that big announcement we were going to make today, but Jesse Ventura, many others at the event, get your tickets now.
[00:22:14.689 --> 00:22:15.769]  Congressman, thank you.
[00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:17.010]  Thanks for having me.
[00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:17.650]  You bet.
[00:22:18.151 --> 00:22:24.014]  Well, that was a bombshell interview, ladies and gentlemen, and it's only going to get more powerful after this break.
[00:22:24.194 --> 00:22:26.095]  Prison Planet is now censored by the British government.
[00:22:26.275 --> 00:22:27.196]  We're on the march.
[00:22:27.676 --> 00:22:29.177]  The empire's on the run.
[00:22:30.191 --> 00:22:32.993]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:37.857 --> 00:22:45.042]  Even terrible gas prices don't come close to the disaster of food costs from shortages already destroying millions of American families.
[00:22:45.302 --> 00:22:48.845]  Wheat for flour is already four times more expensive than it was about a year ago.
[00:22:49.345 --> 00:22:52.948]  Food costs continue to double because there's no food worldwide.
[00:22:56.294 --> 00:23:02.707]  For later great flavored super bulk foods that cost half as much as your groceries cost last year

[00:23:12.705 --> 00:23:13.205]  The cost?

[00:23:15.107 --> 00:23:22.173]  efoodsdirect.com also has a complete bulk supply of superfood at half the cost of last year's groceries.
[00:23:22.593 --> 00:23:24.235]  Call 800-409-5633.

[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:31.581]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:23:32.382 --> 00:23:41.751]  If this is your paycheck and this is your debt, what are your options?
[00:23:42.112 --> 00:23:45.255]  File bankruptcy and tread water the next seven years?

[00:24:35.855 --> 00:24:37.537]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:24:37.817 --> 00:24:41.260]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.281]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:24:43.762 --> 00:24:46.624]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:24:46.924 --> 00:24:52.409]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:24:52.669 --> 00:24:56.572]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:24:56.912 --> 00:25:01.815]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[00:25:02.095 --> 00:25:04.857]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.
[00:25:05.137 --> 00:25:07.618]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded.
[00:25:08.158 --> 00:25:09.619]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.561]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:25:21.286 --> 00:25:23.287]  It was the best of times.
[00:25:23.487 --> 00:25:26.088]  It was the worst of times.
[00:25:27.168 --> 00:25:40.714]  The fact that the British government is censoring PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.com, TruthNews.us, Infowars.net is a big victory for us.
[00:25:41.534 --> 00:25:43.455]  It shows that we're hurting them badly.
[00:25:43.895 --> 00:25:46.716]  When they carried out their attack with Mossad and CIA,
[00:25:48.317 --> 00:26:10.082]  Back on 7-7 in 2005 with the London bombings, when you typed London bombing or bombing into Google for at least a month straight, the number one thing under the term bombing or London bombing, the number one thing was PrisonPlanet.com links.
[00:26:11.742 --> 00:26:16.363]  Now, we have caught major internet companies in England, Australia, Germany,
[00:26:18.086 --> 00:26:20.801]  The United States, BlockingInfoWars.com
[00:26:22.591 --> 00:26:25.633]  If you will notice on most major cable modem systems in the U.S.
[00:26:25.693 --> 00:26:29.076]  now, if you type an address in wrong, it doesn't go to a blank screen on your computer.
[00:26:29.356 --> 00:26:32.978]  It'll be Time Warner Roadrunner or it'll be Comcast Cable.
[00:26:33.779 --> 00:26:36.140]  And they're running everything through their systems.
[00:26:36.581 --> 00:26:38.102]  They don't need to tap anything.
[00:26:38.602 --> 00:26:41.564]  You go through them as a gate.
[00:26:42.025 --> 00:26:45.087]  Your computer is coupled first into their system.
[00:26:45.847 --> 00:26:50.590]  Now, I learned a decade ago, really I guess I started InfoWars.com eleven years ago,
[00:26:51.890 --> 00:27:06.920]  In 1997, so even then, public schools, Dell computers, many University of Texas systems, then we got calls and people mailed us the sheets where the university had screens saying that it was blocked.
[00:27:07.697 --> 00:27:12.400]  Municipal libraries, state libraries, university libraries.
[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:14.781]  So this is one form of censorship.
[00:27:14.821 --> 00:27:24.628]  Also we found out of the scores of internet filtration systems that people subscribe to and download, or in the old days you would mail off for a disk, that would have thousands of websites banned on it.
[00:27:25.088 --> 00:27:26.549]  And there's a family of these.
[00:27:26.569 --> 00:27:31.732]  There's porn, hacking, hate, and gambling.
[00:27:31.792 --> 00:27:32.472]  That's the four
[00:27:34.574 --> 00:27:41.739]  Genres that people, oh I don't want my children seeing this, I'm going to download this program, or I'm going to buy this disk and install it.
[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:50.125]  And we all are included in hacking in many of those private systems.
[00:27:50.985 --> 00:27:52.806]  We are listed as a hacker website.
[00:27:53.367 --> 00:27:54.728]  Nothing about hacking on our website.
[00:27:56.549 --> 00:27:58.010]  And we are also listed
[00:27:59.492 --> 00:28:01.613]  As a filtration system for hate.
[00:28:02.034 --> 00:28:03.975]  Now they've added a fifth to some of these filters.
[00:28:03.995 --> 00:28:05.435]  There's only one way they're censoring.
[00:28:05.636 --> 00:28:06.156]  There's many.
[00:28:06.996 --> 00:28:09.958]  They hit you from multiple sides, multi-headed Hydra.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.381]  Now they're adding piracy.
[00:28:14.541 --> 00:28:27.488]  Now we're not on those lists, but... It's kind of like the TSA list that has over a million Americans on it, or the criminal list that has over eight million Americans on it, that people don't even have convictions they're on it.
[00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:34.183]  This is a control grid to track and trace and make us second-class citizens.
[00:28:35.064 --> 00:28:41.710]  Now under Internet 2, one facet of that plan, there's multiple tracks running on that,
[00:28:42.987 --> 00:28:45.829]  Comcast, Time Warner, others are doing it right here in Texas.
[00:28:45.889 --> 00:28:47.471]  Comcast is doing it in New York.
[00:28:48.091 --> 00:28:56.678]  Other major, the two major companies have announced two weeks ago in Canada that they're going to decide what sites you visit and they're only going to allow a couple thousand sites.
[00:28:57.138 --> 00:29:01.081]  It isn't just going to be InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:29:01.722 --> 00:29:11.990]  It is already just the vast majority of the internet and so your computer becomes a glorified cable system with only a few thousand websites that you can visit.
[00:29:13.305 --> 00:29:17.368]  Now, we told you years ago this was going to happen because we could read the minutes of the Internet.
[00:29:17.408 --> 00:29:23.511]  Two meetings they've had in London, that they've had in Tokyo, that they've had in Austin, Texas, they've had in Chicago, San Francisco.
[00:29:23.531 --> 00:29:24.832]  What, three years ago it was in Austin?
[00:29:25.072 --> 00:29:30.516]  And they always announce at the beginning, it's a consortium of private corporations, universities and government and DARPA,
[00:29:31.963 --> 00:29:37.447]  and other foreign governments that quote the internet is dead and they say they're going to not fix the old hubs of the internet.
[00:29:37.487 --> 00:29:38.748]  They're going to let those degrade.
[00:29:39.028 --> 00:29:41.450]  They say that's their right to do that.
[00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:46.013]  They also want the authorization by the federal government and the FCC.
[00:29:46.674 --> 00:29:51.777]  That Comcast just got told Friday that they have to stop doing what they're doing, filtering out the majority of the web.
[00:29:52.318 --> 00:29:54.579]  And they are saying they're going to disregard the FCC.
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:56.141]  They don't have that regulatory power.
[00:29:56.841 --> 00:29:59.203]  So the web was built to be free and open.
[00:29:59.403 --> 00:30:02.746]  You pay for it with your websites you pay for.
[00:30:02.927 --> 00:30:06.130]  The people that are serving you pay for it with their servers and their bandwidth.
[00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:08.091]  You pay for it with your internet connection.
[00:30:09.172 --> 00:30:10.794]  We're getting more internet connectivity.
[00:30:11.034 --> 00:30:12.896]  We're getting more bandwidth, not less.
[00:30:13.256 --> 00:30:16.159]  They try to have Ted Stevens come out and say, oh the pie is small.
[00:30:16.399 --> 00:30:17.179]  It's not getting bigger.
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:17.940]  We have to restrict it.
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.002]  Now he's indicted for all his crimes.
[00:30:20.543 --> 00:30:21.543]  There's no alleging those.
[00:30:22.765 --> 00:30:22.965]  So
[00:30:27.304 --> 00:30:30.645]  We need listeners to understand, this is happening, this is coming down now.
[00:30:31.465 --> 00:30:32.446]  This has been declared.
[00:30:35.647 --> 00:30:38.768]  Now, Paul Watson has gone to China.
[00:30:43.389 --> 00:30:45.710]  Paul Watson took a trip there last year to Tibet.
[00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:50.031]  Paul Watson can get on PrisonPlanet.com from Communist China.
[00:30:50.631 --> 00:30:56.233]  But in England, and we keep getting reports from listeners and emails and they send us screenshots of it happening,
[00:30:57.999 --> 00:31:12.383]  Another way they're attacking is, quote, the government's going to offer everyone free broadband wireless in Western Europe, in the United States, in South Korea, in Singapore, and many other countries, first world nations.
[00:31:13.203 --> 00:31:13.763]  Quote, free.
[00:31:13.803 --> 00:31:21.725]  You're paying for it through tax money and then they are demanding that anyone in that area
[00:31:23.991 --> 00:31:29.757]  Who is taking the free broadband, basically click on an agreement waiving their rights to be tracked, to be traced, to be controlled.
[00:31:29.958 --> 00:31:35.283]  So see, they're just making the new internet where you'll have to have a sub-website on one of their major websites.
[00:31:35.303 --> 00:31:37.025]  There's only going to be a hundred of them under Internet 2.
[00:31:37.306 --> 00:31:44.453]  And then nomoreinfowars.com, it'll be myspace slash infowars.com and they can restrict your bulletins, shut you down, delete you, ban you.
[00:31:46.172 --> 00:31:55.554]  But the other big way they're doing this on, quote, free government internet systems is InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are completely banned, but not just us.
[00:31:56.314 --> 00:32:10.657]  Paul then noticed that almost every alternative media site, even mainline alternative sites, you see 60% down, 60 plus percent down in newspaper readership, TV's plunging in ratings, the mainstream media is fully discredited, they're falling apart.
[00:32:11.357 --> 00:32:12.718]  They've got to do this, folks.
[00:32:12.759 --> 00:32:13.559]  They are coming.
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:15.241]  They're chopping up the web right now.
[00:32:15.301 --> 00:32:19.445]  You had better use PrisonPlanet.com while it's still available.
[00:32:19.665 --> 00:32:22.088]  You'd better tell your whole email list about the censorship.
[00:32:22.348 --> 00:32:33.839]  You'd better explain to them the different... We've got to create a war room on Prison Planet and InfoWars now, explaining the... Well, there's really more than 20 ways they're killing the web, but there's...
[00:32:36.095 --> 00:32:44.306]  Six or seven main ways that have sub-systems of doing it so people can identify how they're being censored, how it's being choked, what's happening.
[00:32:45.288 --> 00:32:45.849]  But it's here!
[00:32:47.079 --> 00:32:50.501]  Just like we wrote two years ago, MySpace is a Trojan Horse of Internet, too.
[00:32:50.922 --> 00:33:07.553]  And that got picked up by a lot of magazines, newspapers, Wired Magazine reported on our report, the San Francisco Chronicle did, because their own web people, their own IT specialists, their own consultants, had never put the big spectrum together, and they went, oh my god, this is accurate, this is real!
[00:33:08.654 --> 00:33:10.595]  Well, we didn't put it together.
[00:33:10.675 --> 00:33:11.856]  Quit thinking I'm a genius.
[00:33:12.257 --> 00:33:15.359]  Internet, too, told us the plan seven years ago.
[00:33:16.735 --> 00:33:20.058]  You understand, folks, all we do is tell you what their official plan is.
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:27.483]  Nick Cheney said they wanted terror attacks, staged terror attacks for the war, and then they did it.
[00:33:27.823 --> 00:33:29.365]  They are arrogant bastards.
[00:33:31.126 --> 00:33:32.567]  It's the same thing on every issue.
[00:33:32.607 --> 00:33:36.050]  We're only telling you what is admitted.
[00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:37.411]  Do you understand that?
[00:33:37.531 --> 00:33:44.236]  And if they can acclimate you and get you to accept, okay, they're shutting the web down piece by piece, death by a thousand cuts,
[00:33:46.206 --> 00:33:53.550]  And now they're implementing the most egregious forms of censorship and control right now, and if we just accept and go, okay, that's the way it is.
[00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:55.792]  I mean, we've gone on the web.
[00:33:55.832 --> 00:33:58.313]  I've checked the message boards, YouTube comments, Dig comments.
[00:33:58.593 --> 00:34:03.596]  We've gone from people saying, we're making this up, to people saying, okay, Alex Jones is right, but there's nothing we can do about it.
[00:34:05.317 --> 00:34:07.298]  We can do a lot about this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:07.999 --> 00:34:13.622]  Wim Comcast and Time Warner and a few others, but they're together about half of the cable modem market,
[00:34:15.572 --> 00:34:17.533]  You can pull the numbers on that in the US and Canada.
[00:34:18.373 --> 00:34:24.596]  When they're able to do that, that sets a precedent that all the other majors and then minors can implement that as well.
[00:34:24.656 --> 00:34:29.319]  You have to boycott and protest it and speak out against it early on!
[00:34:29.459 --> 00:34:31.100]  Now is the time!
[00:34:33.421 --> 00:34:35.402]  Now I bring you now to Paul Watson.
[00:34:38.231 --> 00:34:45.954]  Major transportation, major international transportation hubs, censors, political websites, by Paul Watson on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:34:47.514 --> 00:34:59.779]  And this is a huge deal, just more of an example of how they all, don't just engage in censorship, they then, as he's in the massive international terminal, he's reading newspapers everywhere,
[00:35:01.035 --> 00:35:08.142]  Before he visited Europe for the last week and a half with his girlfriend, he was its only article reading China censors, China does this and that.
[00:35:08.583 --> 00:35:12.747]  Oh, China's so bad, they make you sign up for free speech zones, which we already have here.
[00:35:13.448 --> 00:35:19.934]  You see, we have to recognize we're as bad or worse than China, and now they've got congressional hearings talking about shutting down our free speech.
[00:35:21.089 --> 00:35:29.376]  We've got all the major pundits calling for my arrest for the things I say because we're hurting these people because we do have power because of you, the listeners, taking action.
[00:35:29.617 --> 00:35:30.497]  We're walking point.
[00:35:30.517 --> 00:35:31.338]  We need your support.
[00:35:31.598 --> 00:35:33.320]  Paul Watson, tell your story.
[00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:34.201]  Tell folks what happened.
[00:35:35.182 --> 00:35:35.762]  Hello, Alex.
[00:35:37.343 --> 00:35:43.449]  Yeah, I was traveling down to London from Sheffield to catch the Eurostar.
[00:35:44.426 --> 00:35:45.207]  Traveling to St.
[00:35:45.247 --> 00:35:49.511]  Pancras International, which is basically the home of the Eurostar.
[00:35:49.591 --> 00:35:53.234]  It goes to France, Brussels, Germany and beyond.
[00:35:54.175 --> 00:36:07.067]  And I had actually come down on the train using a 3G connection, which is over the cell phone network, to collect some articles to post on Prison Planet.
[00:36:08.171 --> 00:36:23.560]  So I got the articles, bookmarked them, and then when I thought, when I get to St Pancras they've got a wireless connection which is a lot quicker, so I'll be able to use it to send them to my brother a lot quicker because he'd be updating the website that day.
[00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:34.346]  So as soon as I connected to the wireless internet, you know, I loaded up a few mainstream websites, BBC etc.
[00:36:34.386 --> 00:36:35.207]  they came up fine.
[00:36:36.235 --> 00:36:49.686]  Then I tried clicking on a link to thinkprogress.org, which is a left-leaning alternative news website, but it's semi-mainstream.
[00:36:49.746 --> 00:36:52.828]  It's quoted in mainstream sources quite regularly.
[00:36:53.529 --> 00:37:01.095]  And of course, ThinkProgress, I mean, it covers nothing in relation to UK or UK policy.
[00:37:01.615 --> 00:37:03.537]  So to see a message pop up saying,
[00:37:04.326 --> 00:37:07.328]  You know, this website is blocked and cannot be accessed.
[00:37:07.809 --> 00:37:11.651]  I thought, well this is a bit strange, maybe it's some kind of technical error.
[00:37:12.372 --> 00:37:16.695]  So then I went straight to PrisonPlanet.com and got exactly the same message.
[00:37:17.756 --> 00:37:24.201]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, they're all blocked by St Pancras International.
[00:37:24.841 --> 00:37:31.626]  As are, you know, others like CounterPunch.org and other alternative news websites, they're all blocked.
[00:37:32.293 --> 00:37:41.836]  And this was around the same time that I was reading headlines in the newspapers about China blocking political websites in anticipation of the Olympic Games.
[00:37:42.516 --> 00:37:57.061]  So to just experience the hypocrisy of the fact that it was going on right here at home, and the British tabloids and broadsheets were howling about how it was going on in China, was just galling to witness.
[00:38:00.638 --> 00:38:13.103]  Now, Paul, we get reports literally every day of, and I've confirmed many of them, of many other government institutions in the US, Canada, England, Germany, you name it, doing it.
[00:38:14.223 --> 00:38:24.467]  We need to desperately, desperately, get other media outlets, alternative outlets that have been blocked, to report on this.
[00:38:24.747 --> 00:38:26.128]  We need to make a big stink out of this.
[00:38:26.408 --> 00:38:28.309]  If we lay down to this, this sets a precedent.
[00:38:29.977 --> 00:38:30.497]  Well, exactly.
[00:38:30.577 --> 00:38:40.723]  I mean, I get emails every month from people saying, your website is blocked in a library, in a university, in a hospital.
[00:38:40.743 --> 00:38:43.104]  In fact, we've got people in London.
[00:38:43.985 --> 00:38:51.829]  Prison Planet is basically blocked in most, you know, establishment London libraries and many hospitals as well.
[00:38:52.309 --> 00:38:53.290]  It's blocked everywhere.
[00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:58.092]  No doubt, you know, that's got something to do with the fact that when 7-7 happened,
[00:38:59.685 --> 00:39:02.727]  We were basically right at the forefront of exposing it.
[00:39:03.988 --> 00:39:18.417]  But I mean, even to see mildly critical websites in comparison to ours, like ThinkProgress, get blocked just underlines how desperate they are to blacklist any kind of alternative information.
[00:39:21.319 --> 00:39:23.721]  And Paul, now they are announcing
[00:39:24.867 --> 00:39:31.789]  That they are going to do this on entire system-wide grids with major telecommunications companies.
[00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:32.489]  We're here, folks.
[00:39:32.509 --> 00:39:37.730]  We're now at the point where you won't be able to get to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:46.212]  Now is the time for people to go absolutely ape and realize how important InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are.
[00:39:46.972 --> 00:39:50.115]  Ladies and gentlemen, these are precious websites, but not just ours.
[00:39:50.555 --> 00:39:58.883]  They are already announced, just a few weeks ago in Canada, that 99% of the web will be off-limits with their two major telecom companies.
[00:39:58.923 --> 00:39:59.823]  This is everybody.
[00:40:00.304 --> 00:40:01.765]  This is everything.
[00:40:02.105 --> 00:40:05.709]  Because they can't have InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:40:05.749 --> 00:40:12.274]  Last Thursday, we put the call out to the listeners to make sure the story about Dick Cheney wanting to plan terror attacks
[00:40:12.935 --> 00:40:16.297]  Well, that's right, and I mean, the other way they're getting it through is by censorship of emails.
[00:40:16.317 --> 00:40:21.800]  During the Downing Street Memo scandal, which was of course all over the alternative news media, yet it took the Washington Post
[00:40:43.027 --> 00:40:43.648]  We're good to go.
[00:41:01.832 --> 00:41:06.896]  The activist behind that project, David Swanson, did not send out 46,000 emails.
[00:41:06.956 --> 00:41:08.917]  They are moving against us now.
[00:41:09.118 --> 00:41:13.561]  Everybody has to stick together or we're all going to hang separate on this.
[00:41:14.161 --> 00:41:23.929]  They are moving against us because we're on the verge of exposing their state-sponsored terrorism, their fake global warming hype, their global taxes, all of it.
[00:41:24.429 --> 00:41:26.591]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's happening now.
[00:41:26.691 --> 00:41:28.912]  Paul, what's the battle plan?
[00:41:29.112 --> 00:41:29.693]  What should we do?
[00:41:29.733 --> 00:41:30.914]  What should we ask listeners to do?
[00:41:32.324 --> 00:41:42.253]  Well, what's proven successful in the past is whenever something like this happens, I mean MySpace admitted to the fact that we were on a censorship list.
[00:41:42.333 --> 00:41:45.676]  At first they said it was a technical error, then later when it happened again,
[00:41:46.508 --> 00:41:55.015]  We got a screenshot of one of the administrators admitting that PrisonPlanet.com links were being censored because the website was on a blacklist.
[00:41:55.335 --> 00:42:02.821]  And you need to make a master article with the 30 or 40 probably more examples we have where censorship of our sites is admitted.
[00:42:02.841 --> 00:42:10.086]  And I'm so tired of listeners on our MySpace account saying that we're blocking your posts, we're blocking your videos.
[00:42:10.146 --> 00:42:10.326]  No.
[00:42:10.627 --> 00:42:12.268]  MySpace does that to everybody.
[00:42:12.748 --> 00:42:18.032]  Well, Alex, if you go to Alex Jones' MySpace page right now and click on the blog,
[00:42:32.631 --> 00:42:37.454]  Then try and click on the link for the latest entry, which is this article that we're talking about now.
[00:42:37.954 --> 00:42:44.278]  Because I post the first paragraph and then I post a link to the rest of the article, which is a link to PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:42:44.918 --> 00:42:46.039]  Go and click on the link.
[00:42:46.519 --> 00:42:48.580]  It will not send you to PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:52.462]  It will send you to MySpace homepage, because they've blocked the link.
[00:42:52.702 --> 00:42:54.283]  Yeah, they don't let us send bulletins out.
[00:42:55.143 --> 00:42:57.085]  I've got a way to counter them when we get back.
[00:42:57.525 --> 00:42:58.825]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:58.866 --> 00:43:00.406]  Paul Watson, stay there.
[00:43:00.426 --> 00:43:01.367]  We'll be right back.
[00:43:03.895 --> 00:43:05.757]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:43:05.877 --> 00:43:11.063]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:43:11.243 --> 00:43:12.564]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:43:12.844 --> 00:43:21.033]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:43:21.253 --> 00:43:26.979]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:43:27.259 --> 00:43:27.679]  I don't know.
[00:43:45.845 --> 00:43:50.469]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero, and we knew what to do.
[00:44:11.673 --> 00:44:12.654]  At least we thought we did.
[00:44:12.874 --> 00:44:19.280]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:26.626]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air
[00:44:27.318 --> 00:44:28.479]  We're safe to breathe.
[00:44:28.819 --> 00:44:35.622]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:44:35.902 --> 00:44:38.963]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:44:39.083 --> 00:44:44.346]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[00:44:44.846 --> 00:44:47.527]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:44:47.927 --> 00:44:53.770]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.

[00:44:56.271 --> 00:45:01.912]  Mom, if we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:45:03.593 --> 00:45:04.273]  Question.
[00:45:04.433 --> 00:45:08.954]  Is the world getting better or vastly worse?
[00:45:09.094 --> 00:45:13.575]  The world economic collapse could come any day.
[00:45:13.655 --> 00:45:14.195]  Question.
[00:45:14.475 --> 00:45:19.576]  Are you prepared or are you ignoring the signs?
[00:45:19.756 --> 00:45:20.336]  Question.
[00:45:20.536 --> 00:45:24.097]  Do you have seven years of healthy food for your family?

[00:45:47.002 --> 00:45:48.702]  Without water, you die.

[00:45:52.384 --> 00:45:53.404]  Are you prepared?

[00:45:56.025 --> 00:45:58.126]  Go to SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[00:45:58.266 --> 00:46:00.807]  Do it now or become property of the
[00:46:28.263 --> 00:46:29.764]  There's one big thing you can do.
[00:46:32.245 --> 00:46:33.766]  Go get our major headlines.
[00:46:33.786 --> 00:46:35.807]  The most important news we put out a day.
[00:46:35.827 --> 00:46:39.449]  Probably three or four articles we write on the biggest, most important issues.
[00:46:40.635 --> 00:46:51.422]  Earth-shaking stuff, like Dick Cheney planned to attack 12 different targets, including dressing up Navy SEALs and putting them on patrol boats, and having them attack US ships, blaming it on Iran.
[00:46:52.042 --> 00:46:54.664]  You, the listeners, are the ones being censored.
[00:46:55.004 --> 00:46:55.825]  You got that out.
[00:46:55.885 --> 00:47:06.812]  That's why they're scared of Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, because millions of you, together on these sites, are able to break through the electronic Berlin Wall that is the controlled corporate media.
[00:47:06.832 --> 00:47:09.554]  We are kicking their butts right now.
[00:47:11.465 --> 00:47:12.388]  You've got to go get.
[00:47:13.432 --> 00:47:16.803]  Stories like, rest in peace Alexander Schultz and Edson.
[00:47:17.711 --> 00:47:20.693]  Neocons pressured FBI to blame Al Qaeda for anthrax attacks.
[00:47:21.313 --> 00:47:24.776]  Major international transportation hub censors political websites.
[00:47:25.136 --> 00:47:28.899]  Those are the headlines on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:47:28.939 --> 00:47:30.900]  Don't take this information for granted.
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:33.282]  Put it on hundreds of websites.
[00:47:33.322 --> 00:47:34.362]  Go on message boards.
[00:47:34.422 --> 00:47:35.283]  Post it in full.
[00:47:35.883 --> 00:47:42.588]  That's why we're trying to hire more staff so we can post our full articles on MySpace so they can't
[00:47:42.768 --> 00:47:44.609]  Censor that, at least that'll be on the page.
[00:47:44.849 --> 00:47:46.110]  They're blocking our videos.
[00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:48.871]  YouTube, we know, is messing with the counters.
[00:47:49.431 --> 00:47:58.776]  We know that Google would change our hits, or when we were getting a video that might be having a half million hits a day, they would just block it for a few weeks, or erase it.
[00:47:59.216 --> 00:48:02.498]  And then they stopped putting the counters on Google Video.
[00:48:02.678 --> 00:48:04.539]  Started knocking us out of the number one spot.
[00:48:04.819 --> 00:48:07.580]  We're winning the info war, and they're cheating!
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:08.841]  Of course they're cheating!
[00:48:10.273 --> 00:48:11.133]  They want tyranny.
[00:48:11.153 --> 00:48:12.393]  They want dehumanization.
[00:48:13.134 --> 00:48:14.114]  Folks, we need your help.
[00:48:14.154 --> 00:48:17.395]  We need InfoWarriors, not orders from headquarters, but to every day.
[00:48:17.415 --> 00:48:23.116]  And for thirty minutes, all of you who are computer savvy, go in there, copy our stories, post them everywhere, post them.
[00:48:23.556 --> 00:48:30.638]  You know, if every listener out there who's on the website will just start copying our stories, emailing them out to everybody, posting them on sites.
[00:48:30.938 --> 00:48:32.998]  We have to let the New World Order know we're not going to put up with this.
[00:48:33.058 --> 00:48:36.359]  And let everybody know, PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com.
[00:48:37.339 --> 00:48:42.643]  Infowars.net, jonesreport.com, these sites are scaring the globalists to death.
[00:48:43.143 --> 00:48:46.026]  They are shutting us down, they are censoring us everywhere.
[00:48:46.626 --> 00:48:49.568]  Appreciate our Google videos, appreciate the YouTube videos.
[00:48:50.009 --> 00:48:52.731]  They're not going to be there forever, folks, if they're able to win.
[00:48:53.351 --> 00:48:54.232]  They're moving now.
[00:48:54.312 --> 00:48:57.253]  We better get the word out while we've still got some punch!
[00:48:57.874 --> 00:48:58.474]  You understand?
[00:48:58.514 --> 00:48:59.214]  Paul Watson.
[00:48:59.695 --> 00:49:00.495]  Any other ideas?
[00:49:00.535 --> 00:49:03.577]  I guess complain to these ISPs.
[00:49:03.657 --> 00:49:05.658]  Cancel your service if they don't unblock it.
[00:49:05.958 --> 00:49:06.939]  I mean, every one of you.
[00:49:06.979 --> 00:49:07.619]  You can't count.
[00:49:07.659 --> 00:49:09.100]  Look, you can forget Congress.
[00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:10.561]  You can forget the executive.
[00:49:10.621 --> 00:49:11.642]  It's all bought and paid for.
[00:49:11.922 --> 00:49:14.423]  We've got to take the country and the world back to the grassroots.
[00:49:14.623 --> 00:49:15.664]  They're moving to block us.
[00:49:15.844 --> 00:49:18.385]  And they're moving to block us because we are having an effect.
[00:49:18.405 --> 00:49:18.986]  Paul Watson.
[00:49:20.083 --> 00:49:34.246]  Well, yeah, it's been successful in the past when Google blocked Spacewar!, which is a mainstream website, carries AFP articles, some of them mildly critical of China's geopolitical aspirations.
[00:49:34.846 --> 00:49:38.967]  Google simply delisted that website from their entire search engine.
[00:49:38.987 --> 00:49:41.968]  There was an outcry and it came back a couple of days later.
[00:49:42.048 --> 00:49:43.588]  And let's be clear, Paul, I'm going to hold you over.
[00:49:43.648 --> 00:49:44.248]  Let's be clear.
[00:49:46.349 --> 00:49:48.109]  YouTube, Google,
[00:49:49.099 --> 00:49:49.699]  Yahoo!
[00:49:49.919 --> 00:49:53.781]  They all admit for three years they are censoring for Communist China.
[00:49:54.221 --> 00:49:56.722]  They get the list from them and do what they say.
[00:49:57.202 --> 00:49:57.842]  You understand?
[00:49:58.702 --> 00:50:02.444]  Now they're doing it on a mass scale in the U.S., England, Canada, and Europe.
[00:50:02.864 --> 00:50:08.706]  Are we going to put up with Communist Chinese style, or worse, censorship of the sites?
[00:50:08.826 --> 00:50:09.666]  It's happening!
[00:50:09.706 --> 00:50:10.566]  Do you understand?
[00:50:10.586 --> 00:50:13.827]  That's the point, Alex.
[00:50:14.247 --> 00:50:15.548]  As you said, I was in China.
[00:50:16.576 --> 00:50:21.481]  There's a delay every time you visit a website while it's checked against the government blacklist.
[00:50:22.202 --> 00:50:26.165]  And PrisonPlanet.com isn't on that blacklist, but it is in London, England.
[00:50:27.627 --> 00:50:30.570]  Ladies and gentlemen, the government of Britannia.
[00:50:31.210 --> 00:50:36.596]  The criminal organization is blocking all of our websites, and many others.
[00:50:37.316 --> 00:50:40.119]  We'll be right back to keep breaking this down with Paul Watson.
[00:50:40.399 --> 00:50:41.000]  Stay with us.
[00:50:45.023 --> 00:50:46.864]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:50:48.225 --> 00:50:51.907]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:53.968 --> 00:50:55.369]  It is a big idea.
[00:50:55.389 --> 00:50:57.510]  A new world order.
[00:50:58.210 --> 00:51:02.432]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:51:03.073 --> 00:51:05.254]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:51:05.934 --> 00:51:08.135]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:51:08.716 --> 00:51:11.137]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:51:11.901 --> 00:51:19.232]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:51:22.247 --> 00:51:27.209]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:51:27.689 --> 00:51:31.170]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:51:31.550 --> 00:51:34.051]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:51:34.131 --> 00:51:35.271]  Most people have no idea.
[00:51:35.291 --> 00:51:36.051]  They're not after money.
[00:51:36.071 --> 00:51:37.132]  They have all the money they need.
[00:51:37.352 --> 00:51:38.072]  They're after power.
[00:51:38.332 --> 00:51:39.352]  That's what they're after these days.
[00:51:39.492 --> 00:51:44.014]  Order In Game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:51:44.234 --> 00:51:47.015]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:51:48.215 --> 00:51:48.575]  Endgame.
[00:51:48.956 --> 00:51:50.497]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:51:50.977 --> 00:51:52.217]  You have been warned.
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:58.061]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:58.541 --> 00:52:01.323]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:07.876 --> 00:52:08.516]  Big Brother.
[00:52:09.196 --> 00:52:10.237]  Mainstream media.
[00:52:10.957 --> 00:52:12.057]  Government cover-ups.
[00:52:12.717 --> 00:52:13.537]  You want answers?
[00:52:14.297 --> 00:52:15.178]  Well, so does he.
[00:52:15.858 --> 00:52:19.518]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:20.058 --> 00:52:24.159]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:30.221]  I have an idea.
[00:52:30.741 --> 00:52:32.041]  A great way to counter this.
[00:52:37.170 --> 00:52:45.736]  We need folks like the Alex Jones Channel and other independents, Gatekeeper Invasion, NuffRespect, all those great YouTube channels.
[00:52:46.457 --> 00:52:54.342]  We need you to take what I'm about to say, just a minute or two, and then edit it together with the last 30 minute rant down to about a 10 minute piece to explain this to everybody.
[00:52:55.603 --> 00:52:58.786]  Here's what we do to counter the British Government.
[00:52:59.807 --> 00:53:02.951]  Censoring PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:53:03.432 --> 00:53:06.075]  We use YouTube as a weapon.
[00:53:06.676 --> 00:53:10.721]  And no doubt they will censor our hit counters as well.
[00:53:11.402 --> 00:53:13.525]  But we do this as another example for everybody.
[00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:31.933]  And you take this video and you send it out to everybody you know, you pass it on to everyone, and then we show everyone the censorship that's going on, not just on MySpace, not just with the government filters now on websites, all the things that are admitted and documented, worse than Communist China.
[00:53:32.694 --> 00:53:46.727]  You then will witness YouTube, if it follows past operations, when this viral video hits about 200,000, and we've had videos that have done that in one day on YouTube, and then suddenly the counter just stops and adds a couple hundred a day.
[00:53:46.747 --> 00:53:52.233]  I mean, you'll have a video with 300,000 views and it'll have 20,000 comments.
[00:53:52.573 --> 00:53:53.374]  That's impossible.
[00:53:53.954 --> 00:53:56.236]  Or you'll have 40-something thousand ratings and only
[00:53:57.037 --> 00:53:57.937]  200,000 views.
[00:53:57.977 --> 00:53:59.158]  That ratio is not right.
[00:53:59.538 --> 00:54:01.719]  But we've caught Google censoring us.
[00:54:02.479 --> 00:54:05.960]  Both in text, and they've had to admit it, and with videos.
[00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:08.141]  We've had a whole bunch of videos that were number one.
[00:54:08.441 --> 00:54:08.941]  Not anymore.
[00:54:08.981 --> 00:54:10.142]  They just took the hit counters off.
[00:54:10.462 --> 00:54:11.142]  Google video.
[00:54:11.542 --> 00:54:19.805]  We need you to make a serious stink about this and get this out to everyone to then illustrate the censorship they're engaging in.
[00:54:20.145 --> 00:54:21.146]  Google and YouTube
[00:54:21.866 --> 00:54:23.428]  Which, of course, YouTube's owned by Google.
[00:54:23.848 --> 00:54:30.814]  Yahoo and others, admittedly for close to three years, have been censoring things for the Communist Chinese government.
[00:54:31.094 --> 00:54:39.542]  Now they're using those same censor systems here in the United States, in Canada, in England, and there's a whole cocktail of other ways they're censoring.
[00:54:39.762 --> 00:54:42.525]  But again, the British government is censoring
[00:54:42.845 --> 00:54:48.191]  Right now they are censoring PrisonPlanet.com and our other family of websites because we're so effective.
[00:54:48.431 --> 00:54:49.192]  We pushed it out.
[00:54:49.312 --> 00:54:50.213]  Our listeners pushed it out.
[00:54:50.613 --> 00:54:55.599]  Got Keith Olbermann to cover last week the fact that Cheney was planning staged terror attacks and killing our own troops.
[00:54:55.979 --> 00:54:57.120]  This is important news.
[00:54:57.140 --> 00:54:58.321]  We're risking our lives.
[00:54:58.982 --> 00:55:02.705]  And for our safety, we need to continue to be prominent and more prominent.
[00:55:02.985 --> 00:55:04.967]  They're bringing in tyranny, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:05.167 --> 00:55:06.548]  The mainstream media is dying.
[00:55:06.768 --> 00:55:07.468]  They're panicking.
[00:55:07.508 --> 00:55:09.710]  The propaganda arms are losing all their credibility.
[00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:13.653]  So now they're engaging in communist Chinese style Orwellian censorship.
[00:55:13.893 --> 00:55:16.795]  Paul Watson, we need everybody to get this video out.
[00:55:18.056 --> 00:55:22.379]  Yeah, and there's another thing, Alex, concerning Google.
[00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:28.344]  Now, this may be related to the fact that we changed our website design, but
[00:55:29.516 --> 00:55:33.340]  It's happening with old articles that, you know, were under the old design.
[00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:48.853]  And that is, when you search for an article from PrisonPlanet.com in Google, if you search for any other article, you'll get the headline of the page and the keywords or the first paragraph of the page underneath in your Google search.
[00:55:49.571 --> 00:55:53.592]  Now, when you search for a Prison Planet article, all you get is the headline.
[00:55:53.612 --> 00:55:59.813]  You don't get any keywords, thereby relegating the link further down the Google results page.
[00:56:00.713 --> 00:56:04.014]  Now, as I've said, it's happening on articles that were in the old format.
[00:56:04.694 --> 00:56:13.676]  So, I've got no explanation as to why that's happening, but it's certainly resulting in making PrisonPlanet.com articles harder to find on Google.
[00:56:16.024 --> 00:56:24.214]  That's why we need listeners to take our stories, and even change the headline yourselves sometimes to confuse their system and their blocs.
[00:56:24.715 --> 00:56:31.603]  But we have the British government admitting they are censoring universities, city libraries, governments, but it's not just us!
[00:56:31.964 --> 00:56:34.146]  It's thousands of other alternative sites.
[00:56:35.256 --> 00:56:37.137]  We are just some of the most banned out there.
[00:56:37.157 --> 00:56:42.561]  Paul Watson, I want to come back, open the phones up for listeners, their ideas of ways to counter this.
[00:56:42.621 --> 00:56:43.422]  We need your help.
[00:56:43.782 --> 00:56:44.823]  We're being shut down.
[00:56:45.523 --> 00:56:53.289]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're being shut down because our information warfare system is going viral and they are shutting us down.
[00:56:53.309 --> 00:56:55.831]  If you can look at Prison Planet numbers, they're cratering.
[00:56:56.131 --> 00:56:58.693]  Are you going to let them win, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:56:58.933 --> 00:57:01.535]  Are you going to let them shut us down worldwide?
[00:57:01.675 --> 00:57:03.076]  Are we going to be like Communist China?
[00:57:04.882 --> 00:57:15.249]  Paul Watson, I want to come back, open the phones up for listeners, their ideas of ways to counter this.
[00:57:15.309 --> 00:57:16.110]  We need your help.
[00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:17.471]  We're being shot down.
[00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:25.962]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're being shut down because our information warfare system is going viral and they are shutting us down.
[00:57:25.982 --> 00:57:28.523]  If you can look at Prison Planet numbers, they're cratering.
[00:57:28.803 --> 00:57:31.364]  Are you going to let them win, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:57:31.624 --> 00:57:34.224]  Are you going to let them shut us down worldwide?
[00:57:34.344 --> 00:57:35.745]  Are we going to be like Communist China?
[00:57:37.659 --> 00:57:39.200]  Attention please!
[00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:41.942]  I've come with a message of information!
[00:57:41.962 --> 00:57:43.142]  9-11 was an inside job!
[00:57:43.182 --> 00:57:44.743]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:57:44.763 --> 00:57:46.364]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:57:46.444 --> 00:57:49.306]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:57:49.346 --> 00:57:52.989]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the bilateral commission, the CFR?
[00:58:02.624 --> 00:58:07.477]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:58:09.578 --> 00:58:15.142]  John, how dare you?
[00:58:15.383 --> 00:58:18.805]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:58:18.965 --> 00:58:21.327]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:58:21.427 --> 00:58:28.112]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[00:58:28.172 --> 00:58:30.754]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[00:58:31.014 --> 00:58:33.016]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:58:33.296 --> 00:58:35.758]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:58:36.138 --> 00:58:40.880]  Don't be a victim of sudden cardiac arrest due to inflammation of the arterial walls.
[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:47.562]  Our hemp foods are anti-inflammatory and gluten-free and can greatly benefit the health of the human body.
[00:58:48.302 --> 00:58:56.665]  By calling 908-691-2608 or visiting hempusa.org, you can benefit from this wonderful natural food source.
[00:58:57.325 --> 00:59:04.750]  Our customers are also purchasing this natural food for long-term storage, camping, survival and emergency food rations.
[00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:10.793]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit hempusa.org today.
[00:59:10.813 --> 00:59:18.758]  Hempusa.org believes that now is the time to plan for the future and food will be your greatest asset.
[00:59:19.359 --> 00:59:26.143]  People spend money on all kinds of things, but our warning is prepare now for food shortages in the future.
[00:59:26.972 --> 00:59:28.935]  So don't delay, call today!
[00:59:28.955 --> 00:59:31.859]  908-691-2608 and see what our powder, seeds and oil can do for you!
[00:59:36.425 --> 00:59:39.008]  Listener, ask yourself, can I be deceived?
[00:59:39.308 --> 00:59:41.130]  Matthew 24 states four times.
[00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:43.512]  In the last days, many will be deceived.
[00:59:43.713 --> 00:59:46.996]  There are many ideas about the mark of the beast and the antichrist.
[00:59:47.276 --> 00:59:50.700]  What do you know about the beast, its mark, and the antichrist?
[00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:54.644]  Is the beast a superpower nation or a giant computer in Belgium?
[00:59:54.984 --> 00:59:59.008]  Is its mark an implanted chip, a tattoo, the national ID card, or 666?
[01:00:00.229 --> 01:00:00.449]  Alex Jones!
[01:00:28.249 --> 01:00:42.706]  Psychologically, Paul Watson, Curt Nemo, myself, the folks that run InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and allied websites, we have become acclimated to being censored by Google and YouTube and
[01:00:44.085 --> 01:00:44.745]  MySpace.
[01:00:45.085 --> 01:00:46.026]  And they've all been caught.
[01:00:46.046 --> 01:00:46.946]  They've all admitted it.
[01:00:47.466 --> 01:00:49.107]  We've written major news articles on it.
[01:00:49.167 --> 01:00:51.228]  Mainstream news has picked up on our censorship.
[01:00:51.548 --> 01:00:55.069]  Now the British government is blocking us out on their wireless networks.
[01:00:55.109 --> 01:00:55.930]  This is confirmed.
[01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:58.851]  Universities, libraries, this is happening.
[01:00:58.871 --> 01:01:01.972]  We need everybody to get this information out to everyone.
[01:01:02.252 --> 01:01:03.293]  In fact, I need listeners.
[01:01:03.313 --> 01:01:04.153]  I'm going to do this right now.
[01:01:04.193 --> 01:01:08.075]  I was given a large donation a few weeks ago.
[01:01:08.115 --> 01:01:10.055]  I've been so busy I hadn't figured out how to use it.
[01:01:10.075 --> 01:01:11.276]  I knew I was going to do some contest.
[01:01:12.928 --> 01:01:16.609]  $5,000!
[01:01:13.408 --> 01:01:16.609]  And we don't have time to wait on this.
[01:01:16.649 --> 01:01:18.930]  You need to get on making the video right now.
[01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:21.091]  $5,000 prize.
[01:01:21.631 --> 01:01:25.252]  For whoever makes, it can be 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 2 minutes long.
[01:01:25.433 --> 01:01:25.873]  I don't care.
[01:01:25.893 --> 01:01:27.573]  It just needs to be under 10 minutes.
[01:01:27.973 --> 01:01:30.094]  The best video.
[01:01:31.175 --> 01:01:34.096]  And I want it to be on YouTube in one other format.
[01:01:34.116 --> 01:01:35.076]  It needs to be on two formats.
[01:01:35.136 --> 01:01:37.957]  YouTube, one of the other channels.
[01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:51.501]  $5,000 for the person, and we're just going to go ahead and set this date for... We'll go ahead and set it for the 19th.
[01:01:52.523 --> 01:01:55.186]  What is that, a Thursday or is that a Wednesday coming up this month?
[01:01:56.314 --> 01:01:58.576]  The 19th, $5,000.
[01:01:58.937 --> 01:02:02.560]  I've had three or four other contests over the years.
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:03.821]  We will send you a checkout.
[01:02:04.922 --> 01:02:09.206]  All of the entries will be posted on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:02:09.246 --> 01:02:21.338]  Today, we're going to get the information up on the website, so we're going to go ahead and create a section for the contest.
[01:02:25.509 --> 01:02:31.834]  $5,000.
[01:02:25.529 --> 01:02:31.834]  $1,000 goes to second place, $500 for third place.
[01:02:31.875 --> 01:02:36.438]  That's $6,500 in prizes on that.
[01:02:36.879 --> 01:02:42.383]  The individual that gave me the donations and spent it however I wanted, I said, I'm going to spend it on contest.
[01:02:43.244 --> 01:02:53.312]  We're going to have another contest for $1,000 for the best trailer using clips from the film, Truth Rising.
[01:02:55.256 --> 01:02:58.999]  Okay, so that's $7,500 in prizes.
[01:02:59.559 --> 01:03:10.086]  We're also going to have $2,000 prize for a new Declaration of Independence listing the crimes of this government.
[01:03:10.407 --> 01:03:14.009]  It needs to be a 3-4 page essay.
[01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:23.576]  I need to come up with a number of words, roughly, but $2,000 for the best new Declaration of Independence.
[01:03:25.043 --> 01:03:25.964]  There will be another.
[01:03:26.224 --> 01:03:26.785]  So what is that?
[01:03:26.845 --> 01:03:28.087]  Now that's up to like $9,000.
[01:03:28.648 --> 01:03:33.093]  There will be a $1,000 prize, literary prize.
[01:03:33.714 --> 01:03:35.917]  But the real prize is, it's going to go all over the websites.
[01:03:36.117 --> 01:03:36.798]  We're going to push it.
[01:03:36.858 --> 01:03:37.599]  It's going to be big.
[01:03:38.059 --> 01:03:39.301]  A bill of particulars.
[01:03:43.030 --> 01:03:43.410]  Listing.
[01:03:43.450 --> 01:03:45.452]  It could be ten pages, it could be a hundred pages.
[01:03:45.872 --> 01:03:55.419]  Long listing all the crimes and evidence of chemical, biological testing, killing the American people, others, uh... CPS stealing children, police brutality, the wars.
[01:03:55.759 --> 01:03:57.981]  Listing all the crimes of the New World Order.
[01:04:01.883 --> 01:04:04.485]  That's like ten thousand dollars in prizes.
[01:04:04.705 --> 01:04:04.945]  Okay?
[01:04:04.985 --> 01:04:05.646]  I keep waiting.
[01:04:05.946 --> 01:04:06.967]  I wanted to write these up.
[01:04:07.027 --> 01:04:07.988]  I'm just launching it now.
[01:04:09.369 --> 01:04:09.629]  Okay?
[01:04:10.816 --> 01:04:12.557]  The 19th is the deadline.
[01:04:13.078 --> 01:04:14.379]  The 19th of August.
[01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:19.462]  That gives you like 15 days, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:19.502 --> 01:04:20.063]  Don't wait.
[01:04:20.703 --> 01:04:21.884]  Make the videos now.
[01:04:22.384 --> 01:04:23.625]  Write the essays now.
[01:04:24.105 --> 01:04:33.892]  We will create a email, several emails for the contest, a page, a comment section, a message board, and then of course hundreds of videos will be made with each contest.
[01:04:34.072 --> 01:04:35.253]  That'll reach tens of millions.
[01:04:38.703 --> 01:04:46.030]  Millions will end up in the aggregate reading the new Declaration of Independence and another contest, the Bill of Particulars.
[01:04:46.550 --> 01:04:59.922]  That's what they had for the, well, from really 1760 into 1775 was they had little handbills, little newsletters, they were censored then, listing the crimes of the government, listing the abuses.
[01:05:00.402 --> 01:05:01.804]  So there you go, a bunch of different
[01:05:02.444 --> 01:05:03.465]  I've been meaning to launch that.
[01:05:03.545 --> 01:05:05.667]  I'm launching it now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:05:05.768 --> 01:05:06.889]  Thanks to a great guy, Darrell.
[01:05:07.409 --> 01:05:08.330]  Darrell, I got your call yesterday.
[01:05:08.350 --> 01:05:09.091]  I'm going to be calling you.
[01:05:09.291 --> 01:05:10.753]  Who gave us the donation to do that.
[01:05:11.133 --> 01:05:13.075]  There you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:05:13.435 --> 01:05:14.676]  That's how we're going to counter this.
[01:05:14.716 --> 01:05:15.778]  But I need you now.
[01:05:16.638 --> 01:05:17.659]  You've got great minds.
[01:05:21.303 --> 01:05:22.144]  You're great editors.
[01:05:22.384 --> 01:05:23.786]  We'll post them all on the website now.
[01:05:25.859 --> 01:05:26.800]  I need you to not wait.
[01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:30.702]  We're going to have... I'm going to go to $11,000.
[01:05:30.943 --> 01:05:42.751]  A $1,000 prize for whoever, by Friday, makes the best video, and that will be chosen by... I'll tell you Monday who the winner is on this $1,000 prize.
[01:05:43.511 --> 01:05:43.952]  You know what?
[01:05:44.752 --> 01:05:45.173]  Let's make it $2,000!
[01:05:45.733 --> 01:05:48.955]  No, no, no!
[01:05:48.975 --> 01:05:51.137]  $3,000 prize for next Monday.
[01:05:51.597 --> 01:05:54.299]  It's got to be on the web by Friday, and you know who wins the $3,000 prize?
[01:05:56.633 --> 01:05:58.234]  To defeat tyranny and censorship?
[01:05:58.654 --> 01:06:06.178]  Whoever gets the most hits on YouTube with a video about this censorship, editing together the last 45 minutes down to 10 minutes.
[01:06:06.398 --> 01:06:07.118]  Give me 5 minutes.
[01:06:07.359 --> 01:06:14.282]  Whoever edits the best video down that gets the most hits as of Monday morning.
[01:06:16.043 --> 01:06:16.343]  Okay?
[01:06:16.663 --> 01:06:17.104]  You will get $3,000.
[01:06:17.784 --> 01:06:25.568]  And I'm going to be searching YouTube and seeing what's gotten the most hits, but we'll call that the censorship.
[01:06:27.213 --> 01:06:29.474]  The censorship contest.
[01:06:30.675 --> 01:06:31.855]  And then you'll need to email those.
[01:06:31.875 --> 01:06:33.616]  We'll have email addresses up for you the next day.
[01:06:33.896 --> 01:06:38.758]  So now we've got, what is it, four or five contests of over $11,000 coming up for the 19th.
[01:06:38.818 --> 01:06:44.541]  But $3,000, $3,000 for whatever's most viral and whatever's had the most views as of
[01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:55.972]  I think it's a good way to get people motivated, certainly.
[01:06:55.992 --> 01:06:58.795]  This is one of the most important subjects at present because
[01:07:11.403 --> 01:07:16.567]  They still consider the internet to be somewhat out of their control, and they want to centralize control of it.
[01:07:16.768 --> 01:07:19.090]  That's one of the main agendas.
[01:07:19.210 --> 01:07:20.411]  And why do we need the web?
[01:07:20.871 --> 01:07:23.653]  Because, ladies and gentlemen, why do they have to shut it down and restrict it?
[01:07:24.154 --> 01:07:35.664]  Because the New York cops can run 15 feet and knock a bicycler off and bust their head open, and then charge that person with assaulting the police, and then it gets shown that the cop went and tackled him, and then the cop gets in trouble.
[01:07:36.224 --> 01:07:36.846]  Or the police.
[01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:40.196]  Some guy's walking outside out of a convenience store with a glass of ice, no alcohol.
[01:07:40.577 --> 01:07:41.339]  They say, come here.
[01:07:41.399 --> 01:07:41.881]  He doesn't.
[01:07:42.101 --> 01:07:43.746]  So they beat him with a baton, bloody.
[01:07:44.778 --> 01:07:46.119]  That comes out, they get in trouble.
[01:07:46.679 --> 01:07:48.780]  All this is hurting the New World Order.
[01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:50.280]  It's come to a flashpoint.
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:55.342]  They thought they'd use the web as the worldwide wiretap, as DARPA called it 25 years ago, as the joke.
[01:07:55.742 --> 01:07:59.143]  But we've used it as a web to capture them and expose them.
[01:07:59.183 --> 01:08:01.164]  They dug a pit for us and they've fallen into it.
[01:08:01.364 --> 01:08:03.405]  They want to shut it down and go to a controlled web.
[01:08:03.605 --> 01:08:04.646]  Paul, I'm really fired up.
[01:08:04.686 --> 01:08:06.286]  I want to go to some calls here in a moment for you.
[01:08:06.506 --> 01:08:08.167]  But right now, any other points you've got?
[01:08:09.567 --> 01:08:10.348]  Yeah.
[01:08:11.148 --> 01:08:13.509]  People like Bill Gates have proposed
[01:08:14.415 --> 01:08:14.715]  I don't
[01:08:34.534 --> 01:08:41.575]  The anarchic and hazardous nature of the public internet meant that companies are now constructing supervised private IP networks.
[01:08:41.655 --> 01:08:42.515]  And this was years ago.
[01:08:42.915 --> 01:08:45.016]  Quote, the internet is dead or dying.
[01:08:45.076 --> 01:08:47.016]  It's full of viruses, worms and porn.
[01:08:47.356 --> 01:08:49.817]  You have to wear a Kevlar suit before you go online.
[01:08:50.157 --> 01:08:53.917]  BT is creating a private network which will be joined to other private networks.
[01:08:54.257 --> 01:08:57.878]  And this is internet 2, which has been around for at least 6 or 7 years.
[01:08:57.898 --> 01:09:03.599]  Meanwhile, it's the big networks, most of them, that are in the business of porn through subsidiaries, making the money.
[01:09:04.431 --> 01:09:07.122]  And then they don't censor the porn, they censor us!
[01:09:07.824 --> 01:09:09.170]  And all of you tomorrow!
[01:09:12.537 --> 01:09:13.257]  Go ahead, Watson.
[01:09:13.697 --> 01:09:21.399]  That's the future, is a website on a government sub-domain where you have to get a registration just to exist.
[01:09:21.879 --> 01:09:32.501]  And of course you'll get the DVD downloads in seconds and the high-resolution teleconferencing facilities which universities and corporations already have access to and are using.
[01:09:32.541 --> 01:09:34.901]  That they used tax money to build in the last seven years.
[01:09:35.541 --> 01:09:39.982]  Yeah, on the fiber optic networks, but you won't have access to prismplanet.com.
[01:09:41.923 --> 01:09:47.967]  Paul Watson, I need you to go listen to the announcement I just made about these contests.
[01:09:48.027 --> 01:09:52.611]  I had a huge article out on that listing why we're doing it, how it's to counter censorship.
[01:09:54.192 --> 01:10:01.357]  I mean, I don't know, I think that's like $14,000 or more in prizes, ladies and gentlemen, to be paid out in the next 15 days.
[01:10:01.377 --> 01:10:03.038]  3,000 of it on Monday.
[01:10:03.498 --> 01:10:05.039]  You're going to get mail-to-check Monday.
[01:10:05.359 --> 01:10:08.702]  Whoever creates a video about this censorship that goes the most viral.
[01:10:09.818 --> 01:10:11.419]  It is up to you, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:10:12.459 --> 01:10:15.160]  I mean, if we don't have the web, folks, we don't have anything.
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:17.521]  Paul, I can't believe they're doing this.
[01:10:17.981 --> 01:10:18.661]  But I can.
[01:10:18.701 --> 01:10:19.582]  I mean, we're kicking their butt.
[01:10:21.562 --> 01:10:22.183]  Well, that's right.
[01:10:22.203 --> 01:10:23.463]  I mean, they're moving forward.
[01:10:24.283 --> 01:10:27.785]  They know that the Internet is the last outpost of freedom of speech.
[01:10:28.645 --> 01:10:30.325]  And we're using it to its full effect.
[01:10:30.385 --> 01:10:31.586]  So they've announced
[01:10:32.449 --> 01:10:34.150]  No, you know, they've declared war on it.
[01:10:34.210 --> 01:10:39.434]  The White House has, the CENTCOM has, and now are being censored by the British government as well.
[01:11:02.349 --> 01:11:02.709]  Paul?
[01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:04.991]  Will the listeners come to our aid?
[01:11:05.212 --> 01:11:07.233]  We are the champions on the front line for you!
[01:11:07.253 --> 01:11:15.000]  That's right, it's the battleground and we need as many troops in the cyber warfare as possible.
[01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:28.312]  Folks, we can completely kick their ass if you will just take action and stop screwing around and face down the New World Order and get aggressive and dedicate yourself to making videos and posting stories and getting information out about web censorship.
[01:11:29.298 --> 01:11:31.820]  And we're going to start writing articles every day about this.
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:32.921]  We're trying to move into a bigger office.
[01:11:32.941 --> 01:11:34.322]  We're going to try to hire more people.
[01:11:34.542 --> 01:11:35.923]  We're fighting as hard as we can.
[01:11:36.143 --> 01:11:37.384]  We need your help right now.
[01:11:37.564 --> 01:11:38.044]  We need you.
[01:11:38.064 --> 01:11:39.946]  The enemy's knocking down the wall at the gates.
[01:11:40.146 --> 01:11:41.487]  We've got to block them at the breach.
[01:11:41.747 --> 01:11:43.148]  This is it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:44.829 --> 01:11:45.510]  I need you to wait.
[01:11:45.530 --> 01:11:46.711]  Not wait any time.
[01:11:46.791 --> 01:11:47.031]  Now.
[01:11:47.051 --> 01:11:49.973]  We're going to be uploading the video of this to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:11:50.033 --> 01:11:50.954]  You can grab it from there.
[01:11:51.474 --> 01:11:52.315]  In fact, I'm going to take
[01:11:53.223 --> 01:11:59.291]  This last hour rant, and I'm gonna post it free on the internet this afternoon, okay?
[01:12:00.573 --> 01:12:01.494]  This is going up free.
[01:12:01.514 --> 01:12:02.395]  I gotta pay for it.
[01:12:02.436 --> 01:12:03.918]  It'll cost me thousands of dollars.
[01:12:05.445 --> 01:12:06.487]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:12:06.887 --> 01:12:12.354]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:12:12.955 --> 01:12:13.435]  That's right.
[01:12:13.756 --> 01:12:16.038]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:12:16.599 --> 01:12:23.548]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:12:24.088 --> 01:12:31.774]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:12:32.215 --> 01:12:37.078]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:12:37.699 --> 01:12:42.703]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:12:43.504 --> 01:12:47.627]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:12:48.007 --> 01:12:48.267]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:12:48.288 --> 01:12:50.210]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:50.590]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:12:50.610 --> 01:12:51.151]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:13:04.813 --> 01:13:10.556]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[01:13:10.896 --> 01:13:16.519]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high-stress lifestyles.
[01:13:16.839 --> 01:13:20.701]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[01:13:20.981 --> 01:13:25.924]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[01:13:26.164 --> 01:13:33.648]  At SnyderHealth.com, we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science, the leader in water ionization technology for over 25 years.
[01:13:34.648 --> 01:13:44.652]  Instantly transform ordinary tap water into clean, living, energized water containing alkaline minerals, disease-fighting antioxidants, and highly absorbable oxygen.
[01:13:44.912 --> 01:13:49.755]  Now you can easily and effectively rid your body of harmful acidic waste with alkaline ionized water.

[01:14:03.596 --> 01:14:06.117]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:14:06.457 --> 01:14:07.738]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[01:14:08.018 --> 01:14:09.998]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:14:10.159 --> 01:14:11.919]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:14:12.059 --> 01:14:13.320]  The late, great USA.
[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:14.980]  America, freedom to fascism.
[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:22.163]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[01:14:36.048 --> 01:14:38.149]  All available at PrisonPlanet.com.

[01:14:50.134 --> 01:14:51.054]  Knowledge is power.
[01:14:51.274 --> 01:14:55.016]  And the information you need to effectively wake up your fellow man and fight the new
[01:14:55.196 --> 01:14:55.816]  We're good to go.
[01:15:12.479 --> 01:15:17.722]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[01:15:17.942 --> 01:15:28.449]  Though the people of the U.S., where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reining them in and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[01:15:28.929 --> 01:15:32.953]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[01:15:33.333 --> 01:15:35.816]  They oppose everything that is God and Truth.
[01:15:36.116 --> 01:15:39.359]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[01:15:39.679 --> 01:15:52.211]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the Earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.
[01:15:52.671 --> 01:15:56.173]  Visit our website at unveilingthem.com.
[01:15:56.393 --> 01:16:00.416]  That's U-N-V-E-I-L-I-N-G them dot com.
[01:16:00.696 --> 01:16:02.017]  The message of his kingdom.
[01:16:03.978 --> 01:16:06.199]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:16:06.219 --> 01:16:09.521]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:16:29.724 --> 01:16:31.587]  Zsa Zsa in New York.
[01:16:31.647 --> 01:16:32.949]  You're on the air with Paul Watson.
[01:16:32.969 --> 01:16:33.410]  Go ahead.
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:35.541]  What's up, Alex?
[01:16:35.621 --> 01:16:36.461]  I'm a new fan.
[01:16:36.521 --> 01:16:37.582]  I love you to death.
[01:16:37.642 --> 01:16:41.044]  You know, I found you by freak accident.
[01:16:41.084 --> 01:16:43.886]  One of my fans sent me to you because I've been fighting with this.
[01:16:44.206 --> 01:16:47.068]  My cousin, my late cousin, is Aaron Russo, actually.
[01:16:47.108 --> 01:16:47.988]  We were very tight.
[01:16:48.068 --> 01:16:50.009]  You're a hip-hop artist, a blonde.
[01:16:50.069 --> 01:16:50.570]  I've seen you.
[01:16:51.190 --> 01:16:52.311]  I'm a rapper, that's right.
[01:16:52.331 --> 01:16:53.752]  I'm also a visual artist.
[01:16:53.932 --> 01:16:55.353]  You know, I'm very well known.
[01:16:55.393 --> 01:16:59.475]  My stuff's in the museum, the Whitney Museum, and I have shows all over the world, internationally.
[01:17:01.144 --> 01:17:03.645]  You know, I was targeted, and this is why I came.
[01:17:03.965 --> 01:17:29.492]  I always knew, from day one, I knew that the World Trade Center was set up with an inside job, because I, right across the Twin Towers, I used to live right in Brooklyn, and 9-10, I had helicopters out my window all that night, and I was printing photographs, I was printing mosh pits in my darkroom, I was getting military helicopters overriding my punk rock music,
[01:17:30.012 --> 01:17:32.275]  Well, I gotta have you on as a guest sometime.
[01:17:32.295 --> 01:17:32.876]  I'm aware of your work.
[01:17:32.896 --> 01:17:33.977]  What's your take on all this censorship?
[01:17:45.276 --> 01:17:47.658]  Oh, this is... I am so angry!
[01:17:47.818 --> 01:17:48.379]  You don't understand.
[01:17:48.399 --> 01:17:49.840]  I just sent a bulletin out on my face.
[01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:51.541]  I am so angry about this.
[01:17:52.022 --> 01:17:57.786]  I am... You don't understand, like, the fact that I'm a freedom fighter, you know?
[01:17:57.806 --> 01:17:59.227]  I'm a freedom for speech fighter.
[01:17:59.508 --> 01:18:08.175]  And the fact that they're going into the UK, this country that we ran for... Oh my God, that's the first step for them to really...
[01:18:09.045 --> 01:18:11.186]  To really get at us, and it's scary.
[01:18:11.306 --> 01:18:13.466]  And I'm going to do everything that I can for you, Alex.
[01:18:13.786 --> 01:18:16.247]  I'm going to blast it, I'm going to blare it all over MySpace.
[01:18:16.487 --> 01:18:17.748]  And they've already taken me down once.
[01:18:17.868 --> 01:18:19.828]  I was in the top ten for a year and a half.
[01:18:20.048 --> 01:18:21.089]  I had a million and a half hits.
[01:18:21.489 --> 01:18:22.389]  And they couldn't scare me.
[01:18:22.689 --> 01:18:24.550]  And they've been stealing from me.
[01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:26.330]  They've been stealing all my music.
[01:18:26.670 --> 01:18:28.351]  All these people in the big corporations.
[01:18:28.591 --> 01:18:30.632]  Then they accessed my computer.
[01:18:30.972 --> 01:18:33.613]  Okay, if you know about Aaron, they wiretapped him.
[01:18:33.653 --> 01:18:34.653]  They wiretapped my whole family.
[01:18:34.833 --> 01:18:36.334]  No, that came out in the New York Times.
[01:18:36.354 --> 01:18:38.774]  Well, listen, let me get your info, your phone number.
[01:18:38.794 --> 01:18:41.215]  I'd like to have you on as a guest sometime, because I recognize your voice.
[01:18:41.635 --> 01:18:45.017]  I've seen some of your videos, and we really appreciate you calling, Zsa Zsa.
[01:18:45.057 --> 01:18:46.257]  Okay, we're going to get your number right now.
[01:18:46.277 --> 01:18:47.537]  Alright, you got it.
[01:18:47.918 --> 01:18:48.718]  John, go ahead and get that.
[01:18:49.498 --> 01:18:52.339]  Look, they can't stop us if more people like her line up.
[01:18:53.319 --> 01:18:56.781]  I need the great lady who's at the Ron Paul event, who was on with Burmas when I was out of town.
[01:18:56.821 --> 01:18:58.661]  She said she's a big fan of the show, and that I woke her up.
[01:18:59.001 --> 01:18:59.602]  I didn't know that.
[01:18:59.622 --> 01:19:00.442]  We need her to help us.
[01:19:00.742 --> 01:19:02.703]  We need everybody to help us, because we're under attack.
[01:19:02.743 --> 01:19:03.243]  Paul Watson?
[01:19:04.793 --> 01:19:14.219]  That's right, Alex, and there's a lot of... there's a groundswell of hip-hop artists over the past five or six years, but they're not going to get on MTV, are they?
[01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:17.001]  Because that's another form of censorship.
[01:19:17.041 --> 01:19:31.271]  They pick the music that conforms to the message of keeping the culture down, as it is at the moment, obsessed with sex and money, whereas the groundswell of an awakening that is happening in the background is depressed.
[01:19:32.475 --> 01:19:42.842]  Well, folks, we're going to have a big prize coming up the 19th for whoever has the best video promoting PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com and to stop censorship, but we can't wait.
[01:19:43.222 --> 01:19:45.223]  That's 15 days away.
[01:19:46.004 --> 01:19:49.626]  You've got until Sunday, ladies and gentlemen, $3,000 to have one.
[01:19:49.666 --> 01:19:51.548]  The winner will be whatever has the most hits.
[01:19:52.208 --> 01:20:04.210]  It'll be the same thing with what happens with the 19th, but again it can't be whatever video wins coming up Sunday, because that may be the biggest video then 15 days from now.
[01:20:04.470 --> 01:20:06.291]  So pick which one you want to get involved in.
[01:20:07.231 --> 01:20:08.971]  Get all of this out to everybody right now.
[01:20:09.351 --> 01:20:10.311]  This is so important.
[01:20:10.331 --> 01:20:11.811]  Let's jam in on some more calls.
[01:20:11.912 --> 01:20:15.772]  Matt in the UK, where the British government is censoring PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:20:15.792 --> 01:20:16.172]  Go ahead.
[01:20:17.152 --> 01:20:18.253]  Good afternoon Alex.
[01:20:18.273 --> 01:20:20.133]  Thanks for inviting me on the show.
[01:20:20.908 --> 01:20:21.188]  Welcome.
[01:20:21.208 --> 01:20:28.835]  I'd like to mention, yeah, you mentioned Paul Watson, obviously about censorship and obviously accessing InfoWars and PrisonPanic.com as well.
[01:20:30.156 --> 01:20:32.958]  I've found it pretty hard to even access your site on InfoWars.
[01:20:32.978 --> 01:20:35.080]  Can you turn your radio off because I want to hear what you have to say?
[01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:36.741]  Yeah, of course, come on, one minute.
[01:20:38.282 --> 01:20:38.683]  Sorry about that.
[01:20:38.963 --> 01:20:43.527]  Yeah, I was mentioning that, look, there, obviously you mentioned about Paul Watson, about censorship on your site.
[01:20:43.547 --> 01:20:49.752]  I was mentioning that to your viewers, to be honest, obviously people in the UK, because I've tried to access your site quite a few times.
[01:20:53.749 --> 01:20:55.150]  We did not just hang up on him.
[01:20:56.131 --> 01:20:59.713]  He just called in to talk about how the websites are censored in the UK.
[01:20:59.753 --> 01:21:01.795]  Yeah, we get these emails, we get screenshots of this.
[01:21:02.075 --> 01:21:04.076]  We're being censored like this is China!
[01:21:04.116 --> 01:21:04.777]  Paul Watson!
[01:21:06.278 --> 01:21:08.299]  Yeah, I get them all the time.
[01:21:08.779 --> 01:21:10.961]  As you say, we're becoming immune to it because...
[01:21:11.747 --> 01:21:15.349]  You know, sometimes I just delete them without even checking into it.
[01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:17.311]  And it's happening a lot in London.
[01:21:17.591 --> 01:21:22.434]  From what my brother says, people he's talked to say the same thing, that they can't access it.
[01:21:22.614 --> 01:21:23.615]  John, you just popped in.
[01:21:23.635 --> 01:21:24.135]  What were you saying?
[01:21:24.155 --> 01:21:25.095]  I was just saying, I hear him.
[01:21:25.116 --> 01:21:25.456]  He's there.
[01:21:26.420 --> 01:21:27.560]  Okay, caller, you're back.
[01:21:28.201 --> 01:21:31.562]  You're saying you can't get to InfoWars and Present Planet?
[01:21:32.302 --> 01:21:50.769]  No, and another thing is, I mentioned on this tutorialization state that we're in, obviously I've spread the message in the place that I live in the UK, it's not so far away from where Paul is actually, and it's amazing how I've been followed and been watched.
[01:21:50.809 --> 01:21:51.830]  We've got to jump, here we go.
[01:21:53.743 --> 01:21:54.663]  We're on the march.
[01:21:55.124 --> 01:21:56.724]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:57.665 --> 01:22:00.246]  Alex Jones and the GCN... Caller, you're back.
[01:22:00.867 --> 01:22:04.248]  You're saying you can't get... You can't get to InfoWars in present planet?
[01:22:04.908 --> 01:22:12.012]  No, and another thing is, I mentioned on this tutorialization state that we're in.
[01:22:12.092 --> 01:22:15.894]  Obviously, I've spread the message in the place that I live in the UK.
[01:22:16.314 --> 01:22:18.115]  It's not so far away from where Paul is actually.
[01:22:18.955 --> 01:22:22.357]  And it's amazing how I've been followed and been watched.
[01:22:23.616 --> 01:22:24.137]  We gotta jump!
[01:22:24.177 --> 01:22:24.578]  Here we go!
[01:22:26.341 --> 01:22:27.243]  We're on the march.
[01:22:27.724 --> 01:22:29.347]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:22:30.269 --> 01:22:32.954]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:36.215 --> 01:22:39.157]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:22:39.317 --> 01:22:44.560]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:50.183]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:22:50.563 --> 01:22:51.684]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:22:52.044 --> 01:23:00.909]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:23:01.349 --> 01:23:02.971]  Now compare a Calvin Pure Soap.
[01:23:03.192 --> 01:23:07.357]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[01:23:07.397 --> 01:23:12.042]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[01:23:12.423 --> 01:23:14.765]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[01:23:16.147 --> 01:23:19.669]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero, and we knew what to do.
[01:23:44.158 --> 01:23:45.219]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:23:45.460 --> 01:23:51.867]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:23:52.528 --> 01:23:57.675]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement.
[01:23:58.629 --> 01:24:01.031]  That the air was safe to breathe.
[01:24:01.391 --> 01:24:08.197]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:24:08.498 --> 01:24:11.560]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:24:11.661 --> 01:24:16.905]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[01:24:17.446 --> 01:24:20.008]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:24:20.508 --> 01:24:26.351]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[01:24:26.552 --> 01:24:29.073]  Or order the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:24:29.473 --> 01:24:34.376]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[01:24:35.768 --> 01:24:38.829]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[01:24:39.189 --> 01:24:41.269]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[01:24:41.509 --> 01:24:44.510]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[01:24:44.810 --> 01:24:51.271]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[01:24:51.691 --> 01:24:53.891]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[01:24:54.311 --> 01:24:57.372]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[01:24:57.592 --> 01:25:02.233]  I just talk to clients on the phone, and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[01:25:02.373 --> 01:25:04.393]  So I can travel the world and still be here.
[01:25:06.914 --> 01:25:13.939]  Ladies and gentlemen, the British government has been caught censoring PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:25:16.381 --> 01:25:30.272]  I'm putting out more than $10,000 in prizes for you to make videos exposing this, but not just my sites, how they're censoring everything and the different ways they're doing it.
[01:25:32.445 --> 01:25:36.246]  What they can't stop now, what they're trying to shut down, is the file sharing networks.
[01:25:36.266 --> 01:25:42.628]  You better get the podcast that 60,000 listeners a day are getting and appreciate it and get it out to everybody.
[01:25:42.648 --> 01:25:46.989]  Put it on every podcasting service, system.
[01:25:47.189 --> 01:25:48.469]  It's already number one on most.
[01:25:48.509 --> 01:25:49.610]  Let's make it number one everywhere.
[01:25:49.870 --> 01:25:50.870]  We're serving it out to 60,000.
[01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:53.451]  They're serving it out to millions.
[01:25:53.691 --> 01:25:55.051]  We've gone mega viral.
[01:25:55.331 --> 01:25:58.292]  They're trying to shut us down and they're not going to get away with it.
[01:26:00.265 --> 01:26:03.366]  There's a lot of different ways to attack the enemy in the Infowar.
[01:26:03.666 --> 01:26:05.987]  Get all of our articles we put out each day.
[01:26:06.067 --> 01:26:08.068]  Change the headlines, because that's how they're trying to block them.
[01:26:08.528 --> 01:26:11.230]  Make it similar to our headline, but even change the headline if you want.
[01:26:11.430 --> 01:26:12.850]  Then attack pattern Delta!
[01:26:13.210 --> 01:26:14.151]  Put it out everywhere!
[01:26:14.271 --> 01:26:16.232]  Smash them in the Infowar!
[01:26:16.352 --> 01:26:17.092]  Never stop!
[01:26:17.372 --> 01:26:19.813]  This is the highest level alert I've ever given you!
[01:26:20.093 --> 01:26:23.775]  I want rampaging attacks on the New World Order in the Infowar!
[01:26:24.055 --> 01:26:25.716]  Overrun them like you've never done!
[01:26:26.776 --> 01:26:29.878]  I want each of you, 10 hours a day, savagely attacking.
[01:26:30.018 --> 01:26:31.519]  Get my films, make copies.
[01:26:32.119 --> 01:26:33.840]  Get the podcasts, make copies.
[01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:36.541]  Get the video fees we put out, make copies.
[01:26:36.581 --> 01:26:38.862]  I'm taking the last hour and a half.
[01:26:38.882 --> 01:26:43.084]  It's going to cost us thousands here, but I'm running it all out to put out this video free today.
[01:26:43.144 --> 01:26:45.185]  Why do we charge 15 cents a day for prisonpanda.tv?
[01:26:45.385 --> 01:26:47.166]  Because we can't afford to put it out free.
[01:26:47.386 --> 01:26:47.887]  But you know what?
[01:26:48.527 --> 01:27:00.332]  This last hour and a half is so important that it's going up the next couple hours on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com so you can slice and dice and boil it down and post it everywhere and go completely nuts and show these murdering bastards the New World Order!
[01:27:00.492 --> 01:27:01.613]  They're never going to stop us!
[01:27:03.974 --> 01:27:07.396]  Alright, we're about to go to Dr. Jerome Corsi breaking major news here today.
[01:27:07.577 --> 01:27:09.618]  We're so thankful for him coming on this show to do it.
[01:27:09.898 --> 01:27:11.039]  First place you're going to hear it.
[01:27:11.579 --> 01:27:13.981]  The embargo is lifted today on his abomination books.
[01:27:14.001 --> 01:27:16.302]  He'll be breaking that down for us and I don't like either candidate.
[01:27:16.463 --> 01:27:17.583]  We're just exposing them all.
[01:27:17.783 --> 01:27:18.984]  Let the chips fall where they may.
[01:27:19.184 --> 01:27:23.147]  You have 60 seconds, Paul Watson, in your final transmission on this subject today.
[01:27:23.167 --> 01:27:31.793]  Well yeah, I would encourage anyone who wants to send me their videos that it's Watson at PrisonPlanet.com
[01:27:33.492 --> 01:27:35.135]  I'll post as many as possible.
[01:27:36.798 --> 01:27:42.107]  It's another rallying call to organise behind and get active and get aggressive with the truth.
[01:27:42.751 --> 01:27:45.894]  Defend free speech, stop communist Chinese-style censorship.
[01:27:46.234 --> 01:27:50.518]  Prison Planet banned in the UK by the UK government, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:27:50.558 --> 01:27:51.159]  Huge news.
[01:27:51.820 --> 01:27:52.520]  We're going to be covering this.
[01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:57.665]  Dr. Corsi leaves us in 25 minutes and taking Scott and Carl and Frank and everybody else's calls on this subject.
[01:27:57.685 --> 01:27:58.566]  This is a big deal.
[01:27:58.866 --> 01:27:59.887]  It affects everybody.
[01:28:00.528 --> 01:28:02.650]  Now we go to Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:28:02.850 --> 01:28:05.533]  Dr. Corsi, thank you for coming on today.
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:07.643]  Alex, great pleasure to be with you.
[01:28:07.683 --> 01:28:08.184]  Thank you.
[01:28:08.444 --> 01:28:09.927]  This is the battle for the republic.
[01:28:10.168 --> 01:28:17.081]  Tell us about the incredible research you have done on Barack Obama, which you can now release today.
