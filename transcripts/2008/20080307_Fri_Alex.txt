[00:00:05.817 --> 00:00:06.478]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.118 --> 00:00:08.179]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.000]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.661 --> 00:00:11.461]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.222 --> 00:00:13.143]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.803 --> 00:00:17.406]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.987 --> 00:00:22.090]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:24.852]  Music
[00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:42.387]  Well, we brought you Lou Dobbs yesterday, and another award-winning reporter, Sarah A. Carter from Washington Times, on the border war that's raging.
[00:00:43.308 --> 00:00:50.213]  The Mexican military basically taking over organized crime in areas of the U.S., not just in Mexico.
[00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:55.397]  We have another big transmission lined up for you on this Friday edition.
[00:00:57.538 --> 00:01:12.462]  John Williams of ShadowStats.com, a very respected forecaster and economist who consults with some of the largest Fortune 100 companies out there, is going to be joining us coming up in the second hour.
[00:01:12.502 --> 00:01:18.924]  Remember, they played a clip of him earlier this week on CNN talking about an inflationary depression.
[00:01:20.265 --> 00:01:21.845]  And with all the new numbers coming out,
[00:01:22.535 --> 00:01:22.975]  We're good to go.
[00:01:51.696 --> 00:02:01.922]  On the pro-war side, so we will have him on to talk about The Shell Game, his new book.
[00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:08.426]  So, better late than never, because now he's getting a lot of attention and we're glad he is.
[00:02:08.826 --> 00:02:12.769]  So that is coming up in the third hour today.
[00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.452]  You know, sometimes you run into things from just a year and a half, two years ago, and it seems like a million years ago.
[00:02:19.594 --> 00:02:21.155]  But at the same time, it seems like yesterday.
[00:02:21.615 --> 00:02:24.297]  You know how it can seem like it was ancient, but also just yesterday?
[00:02:25.137 --> 00:02:44.328]  This morning, I always surf around at least 20-30 minutes on YouTube seeing what new stuff is up there, and I noticed that all 11 parts in 10-minute segments of the close to two-hour piece that we did on C-SPAN back in May of 2006, 9-11 Neocon Agenda Symposium,
[00:02:47.822 --> 00:02:52.224]  And so I thought I would just play maybe my introduction to that as a blast from the past.
[00:02:53.044 --> 00:02:58.387]  And later today up on Infowars.com, we're going to post all 11 parts to that.
[00:02:58.427 --> 00:02:59.387]  It's in pretty good quality.
[00:03:00.268 --> 00:03:03.849]  Just two years ago, YouTube was still kind of in its infancy, and we did upload some clips.
[00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:04.770]  They didn't look too good.
[00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.011]  It wasn't really on YouTube two years ago, a year and a half ago.
[00:03:08.131 --> 00:03:08.811]  Now it is.
[00:03:09.392 --> 00:03:11.012]  And so we'll push that.
[00:03:11.092 --> 00:03:16.335]  Hopefully you get it out to everybody because for a lot of people, something old they hadn't discovered is really new.
[00:03:19.008 --> 00:03:22.029]  So that is coming up later in the broadcast today.
[00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.710]  We're going to have this economic expert on with us scheduled for an entire hour.
[00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.712]  And so that means that if you've got economic questions, we're going to try to open the phones up while he is on with us today.
[00:03:34.633 --> 00:03:39.654]  John Williams of ShadowStats.com coming up in the next hour.
[00:03:41.435 --> 00:03:45.816]  Some of the other really important news I have for you on this important Friday broadcast is
[00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:47.326]  Lou Dobbs, U.S.
[00:03:47.346 --> 00:03:49.307]  heading for stagflation crisis.
[00:03:49.367 --> 00:03:50.467]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:03:50.487 --> 00:03:52.108]  We'll read over some of his comments.
[00:03:52.588 --> 00:03:55.369]  Another story from PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:57.890]  Lou Dobbs, New World Order can be defeated.
[00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.011]  Where else you get that type of stuff?
[00:04:03.492 --> 00:04:04.792]  But right here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:05.573 --> 00:04:09.194]  Also, dollar falls to new low against the euro.
[00:04:10.314 --> 00:04:11.114]  All-time new low.
[00:04:11.154 --> 00:04:11.955]  Every day it's a new low.
[00:04:12.915 --> 00:04:15.696]  The nightmare plunge continues.
[00:04:18.627 --> 00:04:24.150]  There's the yuppies running around saying, take all my rights or Al-Qaeda will get me when Al-Qaeda's run by the boys that run this government.
[00:04:25.951 --> 00:04:33.976]  Employers slash jobs by most in five years, 63,000 jobs slash in February alone.
[00:04:35.377 --> 00:04:38.939]  Carlisle's unit, new margin calls may hit cash flow.
[00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:42.120]  Central banks voice concern on inflation.
[00:04:43.601 --> 00:04:45.682]  Fed boost efforts to loosen U.S.
[00:04:45.742 --> 00:04:46.523]  credit markets.
[00:04:47.489 --> 00:04:50.411]  Surge in job cuts fuels worries about recession.
[00:04:51.111 --> 00:04:53.833]  Congress questioned three executives on compensation.
[00:04:53.853 --> 00:04:54.614]  That's a distraction.
[00:04:56.035 --> 00:04:57.395]  Vehicle sales plunge.
[00:04:58.436 --> 00:04:59.717]  We'll come back and cover it all.
[00:05:01.607 --> 00:05:07.392]  Hey ladies, if you love to shop, then visit HerbalHealer.com to browse through their online catalog.

[00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:03.076]  It is a big idea.
[00:06:03.096 --> 00:06:06.818]  A new world order in the near future.
[00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:11.096]  Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:06:11.136 --> 00:06:12.977]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:06:13.637 --> 00:06:15.878]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:18.880]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:26.944]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:06:29.944 --> 00:06:34.927]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:06:35.408 --> 00:06:38.870]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.752]  Build-A-Bear is making great progress toward a world of government.
[00:06:41.832 --> 00:06:42.993]  Most people have no idea.
[00:06:43.013 --> 00:06:43.733]  They're not after money.
[00:06:43.753 --> 00:06:44.854]  They have all the money they need.
[00:06:45.074 --> 00:06:45.795]  They're after power.
[00:06:46.055 --> 00:06:46.715]  That's what happens.
[00:06:47.196 --> 00:06:55.401]  Order Endgame on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:06:55.521 --> 00:06:58.243]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:06:58.723 --> 00:06:59.744]  You have been warned.
[00:07:01.045 --> 00:07:02.886]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:07:03.026 --> 00:07:09.731]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:07:09.991 --> 00:07:18.157]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:07:18.397 --> 00:07:24.121]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:07:24.281 --> 00:07:26.063]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:07:26.124 --> 00:07:28.286]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:07:28.306 --> 00:07:32.672]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:07:32.853 --> 00:07:34.996]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[00:07:35.076 --> 00:07:41.825]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular

[00:08:02.623 --> 00:08:08.667]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.267 --> 00:08:12.229]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:23.685 --> 00:08:27.206]  We have videos up on YouTube that have millions and millions of views.
[00:08:28.486 --> 00:08:35.008]  The average YouTube video that we put up gets about 50,000, 60,000 hits on average from what I've seen.
[00:08:36.248 --> 00:08:41.250]  But there are thousands of listeners to this radio show that post hundreds of videos a day
[00:08:42.088 --> 00:08:47.131]  And for some reason, what they put together gets even more hits in one day.
[00:08:47.151 --> 00:08:54.594]  And this is a lot, because this just went up yesterday.
[00:08:54.614 --> 00:08:54.594]  61,986.
[00:08:54.994 --> 00:08:56.655]  And YouTube updates about three times a day.
[00:08:56.695 --> 00:09:01.838]  I bet it'll be like 100,000 once it updates in the next few hours.
[00:09:02.798 --> 00:09:06.300]  Just part of a rant of my weekly TV show last week.
[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:10.482]  And it's the second most discussed day video
[00:09:11.913 --> 00:09:14.875]  The number one most discussed in news and politics.
[00:09:15.656 --> 00:09:16.976]  Number one top rated.
[00:09:16.996 --> 00:09:20.839]  I mean, it just goes on and on and on.
[00:09:21.179 --> 00:09:24.741]  This one video, Question Your Reality.
[00:09:24.761 --> 00:09:27.243]  They took a little bit of a rant I did.
[00:09:28.264 --> 00:09:29.845]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:09:31.045 --> 00:09:36.269]  While you're still looking for it, I sent it to John yesterday, but out of the hundreds of clips I was sending, if you can't find it, just grab it again.
[00:09:36.309 --> 00:09:37.069]  It's on YouTube, John.
[00:09:37.109 --> 00:09:37.890]  Question Your Reality.
[00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:39.931]  I'm going to play that, but I've got to play it in the first hour.
[00:09:40.905 --> 00:09:45.368]  You know, people see me getting passionate and upset, and some people question, is it real?
[00:09:45.508 --> 00:09:47.849]  Believe me, ladies and gentlemen, I wish it wasn't real.
[00:09:48.889 --> 00:09:55.693]  I wish that when I get up on television and I start talking about really hardcore issues or radio, that I didn't get upset.
[00:09:56.273 --> 00:09:59.215]  I try as hard as I can to not get upset.
[00:09:59.235 --> 00:10:06.279]  I actually succeeded this Monday on the weekly TV show that will be up in the next few days for prisonplanet.tv viewers and super high quality.
[00:10:07.856 --> 00:10:15.242]  I actually succeeded in being calm for a full hour talking about the puppy murder incident and all the other animals being killed and how neocons are defending it.
[00:10:16.083 --> 00:10:17.904]  I was extremely calm the entire time.
[00:10:17.944 --> 00:10:20.626]  But in a way, it's not good to be calm.
[00:10:20.786 --> 00:10:21.907]  We've been calm too long.
[00:10:21.927 --> 00:10:23.648]  We can't just sit here and take this anymore.
[00:10:27.171 --> 00:10:30.614]  I am threatened at a very base level by people that think all this is okay.
[00:10:33.047 --> 00:10:39.133]  So we will play that Alex Jones Question Your Reality is the name of the piece.
[00:10:39.193 --> 00:10:43.257]  It's up on InfoWars.com a little bit later in the show.
[00:10:43.277 --> 00:10:54.467]  Again, we just joined this top forecaster and economist, John Williams, who was reported on CNN talking about how we're going into inflationary depression.
[00:10:56.208 --> 00:10:58.851]  He's going to be joining us in Steve Allen, Atlin.com.
[00:10:59.722 --> 00:11:01.664]  Alton, I can't suddenly remember who's coming on.
[00:11:01.984 --> 00:11:06.727]  Steve Alton, coming on in the third hour with his new book, The Shell Game.
[00:11:07.468 --> 00:11:11.831]  New York Times bestselling author of Meg and the Lock.
[00:11:13.032 --> 00:11:15.854]  The End of Oil, The Next 9-11, The End of Civilization.
[00:11:17.455 --> 00:11:20.357]  So that is coming up as well.
[00:11:21.678 --> 00:11:24.240]  Let me just hit some economic news now.
[00:11:26.187 --> 00:11:28.148]  And it's just more of the same, but it's deepening.
[00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:34.453]  As we told you two years ago, that 2008 looked to be the beginning of the slide.
[00:11:35.573 --> 00:11:45.100]  We were able to predict this because we had scores of top economists from Nobel Prize winners to the father of economics on the broadcast of the former chief economist of the World Bank.
[00:11:47.101 --> 00:11:51.504]  And last January, I asked Joseph Stiklitz here on air, now over a year ago, I said...
[00:11:53.220 --> 00:12:13.454]  If the globalists that you've worked for do not change their policy and have some of the same, quote, reforms that Dr. Roberts and others have called for, Joseph Sticklitz said, that we would begin to see an unraveling slow slide into full collapse by early 2008.
[00:12:14.034 --> 00:12:19.438]  And remember, we continue to say for the last two years...
[00:12:20.985 --> 00:12:21.666]  The middle of 2008.
[00:12:21.726 --> 00:12:23.608]  The middle of 2008.
[00:12:23.668 --> 00:12:25.510]  The middle of 2008.
[00:12:26.891 --> 00:12:41.165]  Last year when a lot of other pundits were either saying the economy was wonderful and everything was blue skies and it was Al-Qaeda, they actually said this, Al-Qaeda propaganda, that our economy was doing bad and that if you didn't like the Federal Reserve's policies or you said we had inflation, you were aiding Al-Qaeda.
[00:12:42.046 --> 00:12:42.846]  They literally said that.
[00:12:42.886 --> 00:12:43.247]  Google it.
[00:12:43.607 --> 00:12:44.548]  They said it hundreds of times.
[00:12:44.888 --> 00:12:45.449]  Mainstream news.
[00:12:46.428 --> 00:12:55.456]  Running the gamut to other Patriot talk show hosts and others, and I don't blame them because it looked like it could implode any time, were saying, no, it's going to happen now, it's going to happen this week, it's going to happen this month.
[00:12:55.857 --> 00:13:05.926]  And I kept saying, well, from all the experts we've talked to and all the information we have, it looks like that this will come unhinged and begin to fully unravel.
[00:13:08.188 --> 00:13:12.692]  The debate was between February and July to August.
[00:13:14.432 --> 00:13:41.333]  The only debate was, because the first earnings start coming in in February, and then more of the reports come out at the end of the summer, going into the fall, and then that's going to, after years of being in a recession, we've really been in one more than two years, if you look at the real numbers, they just kept the facade going that we weren't, that then, if we don't have a good Christmas, and there isn't spending, that this fiat-based economy will...
[00:13:42.907 --> 00:13:49.950]  Plunge a whole other level downwards into 2009, and it will continue for at least three years thereafter.
[00:13:53.511 --> 00:13:55.432]  And do we have a Ron Paul who's going to be in the White House?
[00:13:55.452 --> 00:14:06.637]  Do we have someone who has actual policies that are constitutional, historical, and make sense, that would sure up the dollar, that would sure up our credit and our name, so people wouldn't dump the dollar?
[00:14:07.441 --> 00:14:18.952]  No, they're giving you Barack Obama, Hillary, or McCain, who are all exactly the same in real policies of George Bush, other than Barack Obama in one area, and that's saying no to the Iraq War.
[00:14:19.253 --> 00:14:20.554]  He does have that going for him.
[00:14:20.934 --> 00:14:23.237]  In one area, he was different from Hillary and McCain.
[00:14:24.418 --> 00:14:30.844]  But on every other issue, every other issue, they want open borders, gun control, big government,
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.281]  More socialized healthcare.
[00:14:33.801 --> 00:14:37.683]  And McCain is different from those two, and then he's not openly for socialized healthcare.
[00:14:39.544 --> 00:14:50.010]  Out of the three, and I'm not saying vote for either one of the three, I've really spent a lot of hours thinking about this, McCain and Obama are better than Hillary.
[00:14:51.931 --> 00:14:58.155]  And I say that because at least Obama was against the war, and McCain isn't for socialized healthcare.
[00:15:00.136 --> 00:15:00.596]  Hillary
[00:15:02.077 --> 00:15:07.202]  Was for the war and is for government-controlled rationing, socialism, which means government control.
[00:15:07.402 --> 00:15:09.164]  You say you don't want the government involved with your body?
[00:15:09.184 --> 00:15:11.366]  Do you know what it means to have government-controlled health care?
[00:15:11.387 --> 00:15:14.690]  Do you have any idea with these eugenicists running things?
[00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:21.717]  Of course, if we had angels running things, then as a bleeding-heart position, you could argue for socialized health care.
[00:15:22.409 --> 00:15:24.330]  I'm not even saying that would work or be a good idea.
[00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:25.970]  I'm saying I see your argument.
[00:15:26.411 --> 00:15:28.851]  I understand you mean well, many of you out there.
[00:15:29.352 --> 00:15:31.993]  But it will not work because evil people run it.
[00:15:32.553 --> 00:15:33.653]  Can't you figure that out?
[00:15:34.734 --> 00:15:35.654]  I mean, come on!
[00:15:37.935 --> 00:15:45.898]  The government takes a dollar of our tax money, and sends 32, 33 cents, depending on the year, back to the states with strings attached.
[00:15:47.058 --> 00:15:51.700]  States normally deliver 50 plus cents for services for every dollar taken.
[00:15:53.066 --> 00:15:54.266]  Well, yeah, there's less bureaucracy.
[00:15:55.827 --> 00:15:56.947]  There's more local control.
[00:15:56.967 --> 00:16:01.249]  I mean, even if you're going to be a socialist, at least be a local one.
[00:16:02.509 --> 00:16:09.452]  There are some small socialist communities that have actually done okay because people have more control over how it's divvied up.
[00:16:10.232 --> 00:16:12.513]  And again, I'm 180 degrees against that system.
[00:16:14.053 --> 00:16:21.356]  Liberals look at the quote, free market and think it's capital, you know, crony capitalism
[00:16:22.245 --> 00:16:33.694]  Where the elites come in and use government for corporate welfare and where they go after their own competition and shut people down and shut down family farms and hoard and bid rig and scam.
[00:16:33.914 --> 00:16:35.555]  That's not capitalism.
[00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:43.661]  So I'm already digressing here into economic theorem.
[00:16:45.343 --> 00:16:47.504]  We've seen it played out in hundreds of countries.
[00:16:48.105 --> 00:16:49.726]  We know what happens 99% of the time.
[00:16:52.014 --> 00:16:53.415]  It doesn't work.
[00:16:54.295 --> 00:17:03.058]  Oh, it works for a tiny elite to get total control and then have their way with you, and then any mistakes they make are magnified because there's no checks and balances.
[00:17:03.098 --> 00:17:04.659]  I mean, do you really like that?
[00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:06.940]  Hitler, by the way, had socialized health care.
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:13.782]  That's why a lot of liberals have written books and said, well, we hate Hitler for his racism, but he had a lot of good ideas.
[00:17:15.143 --> 00:17:15.583]  No, he didn't.
[00:17:21.454 --> 00:17:21.854]  All right.
[00:17:26.136 --> 00:17:28.696]  Okay, I like to drive 100 miles an hour down the expressway.
[00:17:28.716 --> 00:17:29.477]  That was a good idea.
[00:17:32.898 --> 00:17:35.059]  But that was so we could move troops, by the way, folks.
[00:17:35.079 --> 00:17:36.339]  That's why we adopted that here.
[00:17:36.719 --> 00:17:38.900]  But they won't let you drive 100 miles an hour.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.861]  That might be a good thing, though, when these people drive and talk on their cell phones.
[00:17:43.581 --> 00:17:46.162]  You ever been out in Montana, Wyoming, where they got no speed limit?
[00:17:46.262 --> 00:17:47.043]  Oh, man, it's great.
[00:17:48.083 --> 00:17:50.924]  Let me tell you, the state police are sitting on the side of the road, just like in Germany.
[00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:55.131]  And if you reckless drive in any way, you're going to jail.
[00:17:56.772 --> 00:17:57.332]  And you should.
[00:17:57.372 --> 00:17:58.233]  You're driving down the road.
[00:17:58.533 --> 00:18:00.574]  The number one cause of death is automobiles.
[00:18:01.414 --> 00:18:02.915]  It's the most deadly thing out there.
[00:18:02.975 --> 00:18:04.235]  Hundreds of thousands a year die.
[00:18:06.096 --> 00:18:09.437]  Last time I looked it up, you have a 14 times... It's in the almanac every year.
[00:18:09.737 --> 00:18:11.858]  Better chance of dying in a car wreck than from a gun.
[00:18:13.499 --> 00:18:17.561]  Better chance of drowning three times as much than you being shot, but it doesn't matter.
[00:18:17.601 --> 00:18:18.841]  They fearmonger guns all day.
[00:18:19.622 --> 00:18:20.602]  But can you imagine...
[00:18:21.249 --> 00:18:25.551]  The way people drive, myself included sometimes, if we had a 100 mile an hour speed limit.
[00:18:25.571 --> 00:18:29.372]  Okay, now I'm really digressing and talking about things that don't matter.
[00:18:31.293 --> 00:18:34.134]  Dollar falls to new low against Euro.
[00:18:37.436 --> 00:18:41.537]  Dollar sinks to record low against Euro, which tops $1.54 for the first time.
[00:18:41.557 --> 00:18:42.558]  The Euro is $1.54 versus the dollar.
[00:18:49.719 --> 00:18:53.402]  Remember, the euro opened at 82 cents to the dollar, so that's 18 and 54.
[00:18:54.723 --> 00:18:55.183]  Do the math.
[00:18:55.223 --> 00:18:56.584]  That's the change that's happened.
[00:18:57.525 --> 00:19:00.447]  The amount of destruction that we've seen.
[00:19:01.748 --> 00:19:12.135]  The dollar sank to another record low Friday against the euro, which topped 154 for the first time today after the European Central Bank held its benchmark interest rate steady and singled no rush to change it.
[00:19:12.415 --> 00:19:14.297]  Then you read this article out of
[00:19:15.921 --> 00:19:17.242]  And it never tells you why.
[00:19:17.783 --> 00:19:21.246]  Why won't these reporters tell you what that... Just the basic mechanics.
[00:19:21.827 --> 00:19:29.695]  I know full-grown adults that live in million-dollar houses who make $300,000 a year, and they don't know... I'll have talks with them.
[00:19:31.536 --> 00:19:32.918]  And they can't understand this.
[00:19:33.678 --> 00:19:37.262]  When our interest rates are 3%, and theirs is 5.5%,
[00:19:41.893 --> 00:19:47.258]  Are other governments and institutions and private individuals going to buy euros and British pounds?
[00:19:48.139 --> 00:19:53.644]  Or are they going to buy dollars if they get a bigger return on buying the other currencies, the other investments?
[00:19:55.205 --> 00:20:00.630]  See, the government, our government's policy of low interest rates is killing us.
[00:20:02.631 --> 00:20:04.672]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:05.313 --> 00:20:14.238]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:14.738 --> 00:20:21.862]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:22.603 --> 00:20:26.464]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMed Inc.'
[00:20:26.444 --> 00:20:28.085]  's patented methodology.

[00:20:59.277 --> 00:21:03.260]  It is a big idea.
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.362]  A new world order.
[00:21:06.082 --> 00:21:10.065]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by our government.
[00:21:10.085 --> 00:21:12.747]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[00:21:12.947 --> 00:21:15.969]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:21:16.573 --> 00:21:19.017]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:21:19.758 --> 00:21:27.088]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:21:30.094 --> 00:21:35.077]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:21:35.558 --> 00:21:39.020]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.

[00:21:41.982 --> 00:21:43.123]  Most people have no idea.
[00:21:43.143 --> 00:21:43.903]  They're not after money.
[00:21:43.923 --> 00:21:45.004]  They have all the money they need.
[00:21:45.184 --> 00:21:45.965]  They're after power.
[00:21:46.205 --> 00:21:47.025]  That's what they're after.

[00:23:08.876 --> 00:23:10.116]  The Late Great USA.
[00:23:10.377 --> 00:23:11.777]  America, Freedom to Fascism.
[00:23:12.138 --> 00:23:18.982]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.
[00:23:19.162 --> 00:23:23.085]  When you visit prisonplanet.com, you can connect to our amazing online store.
[00:23:23.245 --> 00:23:26.607]  Whether you're looking for survival and wellness products like Berkey water filters,
[00:23:26.927 --> 00:23:27.408]  We're good to go.
[00:23:56.807 --> 00:24:09.775]  I read the news today, oh boy About a lucky man who made the grade And though the news was rather sad
[00:24:26.232 --> 00:24:49.192]  Well I just had to learn I saw the photograph He blew his mind out in a car He didn't notice that the lights had changed
[00:24:58.362 --> 00:25:00.303]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:00.323 --> 00:25:00.824]  The English Army.
[00:25:00.864 --> 00:25:04.126]  We've got crazy police state news coming up, too.
[00:25:04.186 --> 00:25:05.167]  But I just had to look.
[00:25:31.997 --> 00:25:33.860]  So the dollar falls to new record low.
[00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:36.923]  Gold right up there at 980 is filled today.
[00:25:38.686 --> 00:25:41.810]  Employers slash jobs by most in five years.
[00:25:42.591 --> 00:25:45.955]  But remember, in the last six, now six and a half years...
[00:25:46.886 --> 00:26:02.712]  The average American lost more than $1,000 a year in pay and replaced good-paying jobs and factory jobs and computer jobs and value-added jobs, manufacturing jobs, with service jobs.
[00:26:04.212 --> 00:26:09.074]  Now the service economy is viciously contracting.
[00:26:09.634 --> 00:26:13.856]  And I'll tell you, Austin, Texas is supposedly the biggest boomtown in the U.S.,
[00:26:14.947 --> 00:26:17.229]  It is now per capita the richest city.
[00:26:17.309 --> 00:26:17.909]  Per capita.
[00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:20.391]  Not New York, San Francisco, obviously, or the Kings.
[00:26:20.912 --> 00:26:21.872]  But per capita.
[00:26:22.393 --> 00:26:23.133]  The richest city.
[00:26:23.534 --> 00:26:27.136]  It also now sells more liquor per capita than New Orleans, the drunkest city.
[00:26:27.857 --> 00:26:28.517]  Very decadent.
[00:26:29.418 --> 00:26:31.139]  I've seen the statistics on prostitution.
[00:26:31.199 --> 00:26:31.800]  It's way up.
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:35.022]  It's quite a Sodom and Gomorrah here, as they say.
[00:26:35.042 --> 00:26:36.283]  A lot of money.
[00:26:37.244 --> 00:26:41.927]  And everybody from New York, California, Miami, they're all moving here.
[00:26:41.967 --> 00:26:42.428]  It's nice.
[00:26:43.468 --> 00:26:44.189]  The secret's out.
[00:26:45.089 --> 00:26:47.751]  But this town was 400,000 people just 10 years ago.
[00:26:47.791 --> 00:26:48.672]  It's like a million now.
[00:26:48.692 --> 00:26:50.133]  They say it's going to double in the next 10 years.
[00:26:51.394 --> 00:26:52.095]  So it's exploding.
[00:26:53.596 --> 00:26:55.958]  And there are boarded up businesses all over the place.
[00:26:56.959 --> 00:26:59.882]  You go to restaurants, there's about half as many people as you'd see a year ago.
[00:27:01.903 --> 00:27:03.945]  You go to the fair, there's about half as many people.
[00:27:05.066 --> 00:27:06.727]  And then I went to Dallas a few months ago.
[00:27:06.747 --> 00:27:07.508]  I told you about that.
[00:27:07.548 --> 00:27:08.529]  It was like a ghost town.
[00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:10.811]  More than half the billboards were empty.
[00:27:11.291 --> 00:27:12.092]  Stuff was shut down.
[00:27:14.821 --> 00:27:16.542]  See, it's on-the-ground stuff.
[00:27:16.602 --> 00:27:23.648]  But I told you about six months ago, my uncle lives out in the country, and there's these swan trucks that deliver, you know, it's decent food.
[00:27:24.188 --> 00:27:31.994]  It's not really, you know, good stuff like you get at the grocery store or fresh produce, but it's just frozen food they deliver, everything from ice cream to steaks.
[00:27:33.075 --> 00:27:42.482]  And they were talking about not even coming out there anymore because everybody's maxed out their credit cards just to buy gas to go to work, and people aren't buying like they used to, and they're saying they're going broke.
[00:27:43.792 --> 00:27:45.732]  See, that's the kind of little intel you get.
[00:27:45.752 --> 00:27:54.674]  I remember being five years old out there on the ranch and the swan truck pulling up on the weekend when I was staying down there on the summer.
[00:27:54.694 --> 00:28:02.056]  And I'd be happy because Meemaw would get me a box of popsicles from the swan truck.
[00:28:05.697 --> 00:28:07.517]  Or those little frozen pizzas I liked.
[00:28:09.658 --> 00:28:09.798]  And...
[00:28:11.468 --> 00:28:13.770]  They're talking about cutting their routes back.
[00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:16.011]  Not coming out as much.
[00:28:16.131 --> 00:28:17.793]  Coming out every few weeks instead of every week.
[00:28:19.714 --> 00:28:20.435]  First time ever.
[00:28:21.896 --> 00:28:22.596]  First time ever.
[00:28:23.797 --> 00:28:26.719]  Oh, the economy is real good.
[00:28:26.739 --> 00:28:30.242]  Yeah, the economy is just doing fabulous.
[00:28:31.182 --> 00:28:31.943]  I had to get gas.
[00:28:32.003 --> 00:28:33.004]  I pulled in a 7-Eleven.
[00:28:33.024 --> 00:28:35.666]  A lot of times I've tried to pay cash, but didn't have any cash.
[00:28:35.786 --> 00:28:37.207]  Stick my credit card in.
[00:28:38.308 --> 00:28:38.868]  Refused it.
[00:28:39.671 --> 00:28:43.153]  It said right there, no debit cards, but it was a credit card and debit.
[00:28:44.554 --> 00:28:45.735]  Pull over next to the mobile.
[00:28:47.296 --> 00:28:47.896]  Stick it in.
[00:28:48.657 --> 00:28:49.557]  Wants my zip code.
[00:28:49.597 --> 00:28:50.618]  Give it the right zip code.
[00:28:50.818 --> 00:28:51.298]  Won't get it.
[00:28:51.819 --> 00:28:52.339]  I go in.
[00:28:53.139 --> 00:28:55.341]  I hand them the card, and they say, well, it was refused out there.
[00:28:55.381 --> 00:28:57.582]  And I said, well, you've got to pay cash.
[00:28:58.263 --> 00:28:59.844]  I had $6 in my wallet.
[00:28:59.884 --> 00:29:01.084]  I gave it to them and got $6 gas.
[00:29:04.477 --> 00:29:06.077]  And by the way, those guys knew who I was.
[00:29:06.137 --> 00:29:07.118]  I've had my car fixed there.
[00:29:07.538 --> 00:29:08.938]  That's how scared people are.
[00:29:08.978 --> 00:29:11.078]  That's how bad the economy is.
[00:29:11.098 --> 00:29:13.119]  That's how many people are giving them bad credit cards.
[00:29:14.979 --> 00:29:17.220]  That's Austin, Texas, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:22.281 --> 00:29:25.142]  Employers slash jobs, 63,000 in February, the most in five years.
[00:29:27.902 --> 00:29:33.224]  Stark has signed, yet the country is headed dangerously towards recession, or is in one already.
[00:29:33.685 --> 00:29:45.250]  The Labor Department's report released Friday also showed that the nation's unemployment rate dipped to 4.8%, as hundreds of thousands of people, perhaps discouraged by their prospects, left the civilian labor force.
[00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:49.011]  What does that mean, left the civilian labor force?
[00:29:49.331 --> 00:29:49.892]  Gave up?
[00:29:51.893 --> 00:29:52.853]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.293 --> 00:29:54.794]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.826 --> 00:29:58.708]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.589 --> 00:30:07.252]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[00:30:07.432 --> 00:30:12.575]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[00:30:12.855 --> 00:30:17.938]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[00:30:18.238 --> 00:30:20.019]  People who alkalize to water they drink
[00:30:20.259 --> 00:30:23.802]  Experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[00:30:24.122 --> 00:30:30.127]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[00:30:30.367 --> 00:30:33.890]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:38.694]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[00:30:38.974 --> 00:30:39.755]  Do your part.
[00:30:40.015 --> 00:30:42.277]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[00:30:42.637 --> 00:30:48.762]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink
[00:30:49.062 --> 00:30:51.466]  Up to the pH of 10, with only 10 drops.
[00:30:51.826 --> 00:30:58.036]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to alkavision.com.
[00:30:58.316 --> 00:31:00.399]  Again, that's alkavision.com.
[00:31:02.743 --> 00:31:03.204]  Hi, neighbor.
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.201]  We all know that knowledge is power.
[00:31:06.621 --> 00:31:09.723]  We've tried to give you knowledge to help you prepare for rough times.
[00:31:10.343 --> 00:31:15.026]  There's the worldwide famine and our country's dependence on often dangerous food imports.
[00:31:15.646 --> 00:31:17.627]  You know about genetically poisoned food.
[00:31:18.167 --> 00:31:23.770]  Two-thirds of the food is disappearing with the bees along with huge crop failures from all-time record water shortages.
[00:31:24.471 --> 00:31:28.133]  You know they're turning food into fuel with corn ethanol plants.
[00:31:29.093 --> 00:31:32.816]  If we do not control our food, food will be used to control us.
[00:31:33.317 --> 00:31:38.481]  Food control has been the plan historically in every enslaved population and is the plan for America.
[00:31:39.162 --> 00:31:47.389]  The only value of the knowledge you have to take control of your food is if you choose to get a supply while you still have the freedom to choose.
[00:31:47.869 --> 00:31:49.471]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com Call 800-409-5633
[00:32:01.747 --> 00:32:03.608]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[00:32:03.808 --> 00:32:06.848]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[00:32:07.088 --> 00:32:11.730]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:14.691]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[00:32:14.951 --> 00:32:21.812]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing that the major oil companies have run, yet they don't want you to know about them.
[00:32:22.013 --> 00:32:27.734]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[00:32:28.014 --> 00:32:29.735]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[00:32:30.135 --> 00:32:30.995]  SFR works
[00:32:31.135 --> 00:32:33.996]  So well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[00:32:34.436 --> 00:32:45.439]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the United States was so strong that they are allowing my listeners to buy one at their regular price of $9.95 and get another one free of charge.
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:50.901]  If you are not completely delighted with the savings, SFR will refund the purchase price and shipping.
[00:32:51.121 --> 00:32:54.162]  Share in the oil company's secret and get SFR now.
[00:32:54.402 --> 00:32:55.022]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:32:55.122 --> 00:32:56.583]  That's 888-USE-SFR1 today.
[00:33:05.325 --> 00:33:07.246]  All right, I'm going to play this little excerpt.
[00:33:07.446 --> 00:33:09.187]  Question Your Reality is the name of it.
[00:33:09.848 --> 00:33:12.589]  It's up on InfoWars.com, about nine minutes long.
[00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:15.191]  Then I'm going to rush through the economic news.
[00:33:15.811 --> 00:33:17.052]  I get stuck on each article.
[00:33:17.072 --> 00:33:25.477]  Then I'm going to get into all the weird machinations of the Democrats as Howard Dean tries to basically cheat for Hillary Clinton.
[00:33:26.038 --> 00:33:28.759]  Again, I don't like Barack Obama.
[00:33:28.959 --> 00:33:30.220]  I'm just telling you the facts.
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:33.222]  The machine is trying to, at least on the surface...
[00:33:35.623 --> 00:33:37.065]  Knock him off politically.
[00:33:37.505 --> 00:33:42.950]  Dean urges do-over in Florida and Michigan to give Hillary delegates.
[00:33:43.871 --> 00:33:47.134]  Associated Press, Latinos seek citizenship in time for voting.
[00:33:47.895 --> 00:33:51.779]  New York Times, Dems can't win without superdelegates, AP.
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:55.983]  Border incident probed in Times Square bombing.
[00:33:57.449 --> 00:34:01.271]  Neocon bloggers blame anti-war movement for New York bombing.
[00:34:01.771 --> 00:34:06.154]  Times Square blast link with anti-war demonstrator that was put out by ABC News yesterday.
[00:34:06.174 --> 00:34:07.254]  Now they admit it's not true.
[00:34:07.514 --> 00:34:08.175]  Doesn't matter.
[00:34:08.235 --> 00:34:10.536]  Neocons are on Radio Center right now.
[00:34:10.556 --> 00:34:17.060]  9-11 truth issues explode on a CBS National Radio yesterday with our guests.
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:18.100]  It's coming up in the third hour.
[00:34:19.701 --> 00:34:22.322]  Feds have high hopes for National Data Exchange System.
[00:34:22.342 --> 00:34:23.723]  Tell you about that.
[00:34:24.624 --> 00:34:26.765]  Archive is blocked release of Clinton papers.
[00:34:28.032 --> 00:34:30.414]  That's what these presidential libraries act as.
[00:34:31.254 --> 00:34:38.479]  Use institutions to keep things secret, even after they're declassified, claiming they own their own papers from government.
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:41.181]  That is all coming up.
[00:34:41.261 --> 00:34:49.186]  And again, top economist forecaster joining us coming up in the second hour here, just about 30 minutes away, or now about 25 minutes away.
[00:34:50.227 --> 00:34:57.212]  But here is a video racing up the YouTube charts, number one in many categories, less than 24 hours after being posted.
[00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:01.593]  Just a little 10-minute excerpt from my TV show a few weeks ago.
[00:35:02.153 --> 00:35:08.358]  Members of PrisonPlanet.tv can see the TV show in super high quality, just like you're watching television.
[00:35:08.379 --> 00:35:11.661]  So be sure and go over and check out PrisonPlanet.tv and all the benefits.
[00:35:11.701 --> 00:35:12.062]  Here it is.
[00:35:13.083 --> 00:35:15.825]  Now we can see a new world coming into view.
[00:35:17.026 --> 00:35:20.909]  A world in which there is a very real prospect of a new world order.
[00:35:29.828 --> 00:35:46.215]  It is a new world order with significantly different and radically new challenges for the future.
[00:35:46.796 --> 00:35:56.960]  The question is, will they build untold millions as they did in the last century?
[00:36:08.608 --> 00:36:11.670]  It is not the elite cockroaches that determine that.
[00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:12.290]  It is you!
[00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:13.391]  I am only one man.
[00:36:13.411 --> 00:36:17.834]  But I am a representation, as all of you are.
[00:36:38.965 --> 00:36:44.067]  Regardless of your race, color, or creed of the human spirit.
[00:36:47.828 --> 00:36:52.430]  I am blasted by the responsibility I have.
[00:36:55.371 --> 00:37:02.853]  I am humbled by the knowledge that I have accrued.
[00:37:07.054 --> 00:37:08.415]  I do not have the words
[00:37:09.594 --> 00:37:33.140]  Or the intellect as primitive and weak as I am to somehow reach out to your human soul and attempt to activate the spirit of the universe that is in all of our souls.
[00:37:37.841 --> 00:37:38.881]  I stand before you
[00:37:41.044 --> 00:37:41.704]  Blunted.
[00:37:43.105 --> 00:37:44.826]  Bludgeoned.
[00:37:45.246 --> 00:37:45.646]  Weakened.
[00:37:48.587 --> 00:37:56.790]  I have been programmed by the society, by the peer pressure, by the lust and needs implanted in me.
[00:37:58.391 --> 00:38:02.272]  I grew up in Dallas, Texas, drinking sodium fluorinated water.
[00:38:03.493 --> 00:38:07.975]  All the scientific studies show my IQ has been reduced by at least 20 points.
[00:38:11.937 --> 00:38:17.139]  But the shadow of who I would have been calls out from the grave.
[00:38:18.599 --> 00:38:24.741]  The shadow of who you would have been calls out from the soul that is humanity.
[00:38:26.922 --> 00:38:28.463]  Your families are being broken up.
[00:38:29.123 --> 00:38:32.484]  Your children are being trained to commit suicide.
[00:38:32.964 --> 00:38:34.525]  Our world is in crisis.
[00:38:35.865 --> 00:38:37.306]  Everything is parasitic.
[00:38:39.867 --> 00:38:40.767]  Every fulcrum
[00:38:41.357 --> 00:38:53.462]  Every benchmark, every root of wholesomeness is under assault because our enemy venturally seeks to destroy all that is pure, all that is beautiful, and all that is strong.
[00:38:56.504 --> 00:39:05.848]  But from the grave that is humanity, I call out and I say to the elite, what a great mischief you have wrought.
[00:39:06.028 --> 00:39:08.949]  What a great dark wickedness you have created.
[00:39:10.327 --> 00:39:14.891]  What a blight you are on a beautiful species that had so much promise!
[00:39:18.634 --> 00:39:29.082]  I look into the eyes of the elite, windows into their souls, and I see weak, decadent people who revel in the raw exercise of power.
[00:39:31.785 --> 00:39:34.527]  They enjoy murdering the innocent child,
[00:39:35.222 --> 00:39:37.262]  They revel in killing the widow.
[00:39:37.742 --> 00:39:45.204]  They revel in dumbing down the tiny green shoots that are children that would grow into mighty oak trees.
[00:39:46.524 --> 00:39:48.564]  Everything they are is anathema.
[00:39:49.825 --> 00:39:54.926]  Everything they are is counterbalance against the spirit of the universe.
[00:39:56.066 --> 00:40:01.927]  Everything they are is a fraud against life and a crime against life.
[00:40:02.489 --> 00:40:06.132]  That every fiber of my soul cries out against.
[00:40:14.258 --> 00:40:19.382]  It is a great pain to me to see their work.
[00:40:22.784 --> 00:40:27.948]  It savages the core of my soul to witness the innocence.
[00:40:28.956 --> 00:40:29.657]  Degradated.
[00:40:30.077 --> 00:40:30.918]  Pulled down.
[00:40:31.378 --> 00:40:31.898]  Bludgeoned.
[00:40:32.339 --> 00:40:33.119]  Destroyed.
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:34.140]  Burned.
[00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:35.261]  Decimated.
[00:40:35.661 --> 00:40:36.442]  Annihilated.
[00:40:36.942 --> 00:40:41.746]  Kindled to flames that only sparkle in the eye of the psychopath.
[00:40:43.847 --> 00:40:45.488]  We are at the crossroads.
[00:40:45.528 --> 00:40:49.632]  We are entering a dangerous time in the development of our species.
[00:40:53.835 --> 00:40:56.917]  The least you can do is investigate.
[00:40:58.359 --> 00:41:06.363]  The minimum that is expected of you as a sentient being is to question your reality.
[00:41:08.124 --> 00:41:13.247]  The minimum is that you realize you are in a box.
[00:41:13.767 --> 00:41:14.908]  You are being controlled.
[00:41:15.308 --> 00:41:16.429]  And you are being fed.
[00:41:16.889 --> 00:41:22.112]  And you are having buttons in your mind pushed and controlled.
[00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:35.371]  You talk about raw will.
[00:41:40.032 --> 00:41:59.837]  The raw will it takes to have the studies from the 1920s and the 1930s, where they knew that sodium fluoride and its derivatives caused bone fractures, cancer, destruction of the kidneys,
[00:42:00.569 --> 00:42:05.293]  Hypothalamus, pituitary, but most importantly, brain tissue and IQ.
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:14.921]  And to put it in our water.
[00:42:18.424 --> 00:42:20.866]  And to hurt millions of people.
[00:42:25.690 --> 00:42:28.853]  To eat holes in every person's brain, listening.
[00:42:30.353 --> 00:42:35.075]  To take everything you want to be and to destroy it!
[00:42:37.876 --> 00:42:44.358]  That's who you face from the cold depths of the ninth circle of hell!
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:51.401]  None of this even means anything.
[00:42:51.461 --> 00:42:54.222]  I cover all their tyranny on the face of it.
[00:42:54.723 --> 00:42:55.943]  Total tyranny.
[00:42:56.043 --> 00:42:58.284]  What does it even matter anymore?
[00:42:59.813 --> 00:43:01.016]  What does it even mean?
[00:43:01.157 --> 00:43:04.325]  I have been robbed!
[00:43:12.324 --> 00:43:30.575]  At the end of the day, I know we're hurtling into martial law, and there's this great wicked intelligence that's scientifically diagrammed and chronicled every single button they have to push to control you to the point of you can't even understand what I'm saying, most of you!
[00:43:30.595 --> 00:43:39.240]  I've told you the truth.
[00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:40.821]  I've told you what's happening.
[00:43:41.849 --> 00:43:49.891]  We have a scientific dictatorship, an elite using scientific technologies to dumb down, control, poison you, sterilize you.
[00:43:50.311 --> 00:43:51.531]  We're all under attack.
[00:43:51.631 --> 00:43:57.993]  Every one of you has had your IQ, your mind, your intellect, your soul, who you are, massively reduced by it.
[00:43:58.433 --> 00:44:01.914]  We have our own documents in the 20s where they said they were going to put it in the water and dumb you down.
[00:44:03.434 --> 00:44:07.395]  And now you're so dumbed down, mainstream news can inevitably poison and does reduce your IQ.
[00:44:08.877 --> 00:44:16.843]  It doesn't matter if the American Medical Association finally gets pressured to say, don't give fluoride to babies, since all the babies want it.
[00:44:16.863 --> 00:44:18.904]  You can rebel as a species, though.
[00:44:18.924 --> 00:44:19.945]  You can say no.
[00:44:20.585 --> 00:44:25.829]  You cannot just count on Alex Jones to start your own access show, your own website, your own newsletter.
[00:44:26.209 --> 00:44:27.270]  Call him to talk shows.
[00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:29.292]  Get your kids off sodium fluoride.
[00:44:29.372 --> 00:44:31.293]  Stop eating MSG and fast food.
[00:44:31.673 --> 00:44:33.255]  Stop eating GMO.
[00:44:33.575 --> 00:44:34.956]  Wake your neighbor up who's a cop.
[00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:37.801]  There are thousands of things you can do.
[00:44:38.281 --> 00:44:40.042]  The elite is behind schedule.
[00:44:41.443 --> 00:44:43.423]  Their new world order is in trouble.
[00:44:44.544 --> 00:44:45.885]  They admit they're behind.
[00:44:45.905 --> 00:44:47.505]  They're trying to accelerate.
[00:44:47.865 --> 00:44:49.406]  Things are getting more and more obvious.
[00:44:50.527 --> 00:44:52.067]  You can do things to fight this.
[00:44:52.187 --> 00:44:54.328]  You don't have to let them just have their way with you.
[00:44:54.829 --> 00:44:56.549]  You don't have to let them just win.
[00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:02.332]  If you take action now, and if you resist them,
[00:45:03.723 --> 00:45:04.743]  You can have a great time.
[00:45:12.507 --> 00:45:27.613]  I'm calling for you to break out of your condition, and to become aware of your condition, and to use your intellect in any way you see fit to bring the New World Order down.
[00:45:31.394 --> 00:45:32.475]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:45:33.582 --> 00:45:39.723]  One of the number one videos on YouTube, not just in the United States, but in the United Kingdom right now.
[00:45:41.664 --> 00:45:49.205]  Last night, Aaron Dykes raced from the time that Lou Dobbs was on with us live to take the 18-minute interview to put images to it.
[00:45:49.845 --> 00:45:51.146]  They had documents to it.
[00:45:52.846 --> 00:45:56.867]  He posted it on YouTube, and YouTube pulled it without saying why.
[00:45:56.887 --> 00:45:58.087]  They normally say why.
[00:45:58.607 --> 00:45:59.607]  We uploaded it again.
[00:45:59.627 --> 00:46:02.468]  We also put it on our own servers for you.
[00:46:03.872 --> 00:46:04.392]  We're good to go.
[00:46:23.101 --> 00:46:26.484]  Those are up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com as well.
[00:46:26.905 --> 00:46:31.269]  If they try to censor the video you just heard, go get it off Infowars.com.
[00:46:31.349 --> 00:46:38.515]  Copy it onto your YouTube or LiveLeak or any of the other video websites.
[00:46:38.695 --> 00:46:41.398]  It's a very effective message completely from my heart.
[00:46:43.159 --> 00:46:48.664]  I have had a lot of people who have...
[00:46:50.603 --> 00:47:05.049]  From TV stations, radio stations that interview me, that have seen me give the Bilderberg speech, who have seen me stand up and give a speech to a city council or give a speech to a legislature or give a speech to a crowd of people.
[00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:17.354]  And I've had, not arguments, but time and time again, I've had people time and time again
[00:47:20.555 --> 00:47:33.417]  Tell me that, oh, you wrote that speech you gave to the Bilderberg Group when you bullhorned them, or you wrote that speech you just gave, or you... Why would it matter if I wrote it?
[00:47:33.477 --> 00:47:34.358]  Those are my ideas.
[00:47:34.718 --> 00:47:35.558]  That's what I believe in.
[00:47:35.578 --> 00:47:36.898]  But I don't write this stuff.
[00:47:38.658 --> 00:47:47.820]  Occasionally when I give an hour-long speech or I have a bunch of people I'm introducing, I'm going to do the C-SPAN, you know, almost two-hour TV symposium that was then played on TV.
[00:47:48.806 --> 00:47:53.970]  I had about ten notes in front of me of what order I was going to speakers or basic topics I wanted to cover.
[00:47:55.091 --> 00:47:56.772]  But I do not write my speeches.
[00:47:56.792 --> 00:47:59.213]  Those come from my heart, from my soul.
[00:47:59.694 --> 00:48:01.615]  And I'm not even saying they're the best speeches out there.
[00:48:02.756 --> 00:48:04.777]  The point is that this comes from my soul.
[00:48:05.858 --> 00:48:07.059]  This is who I am.
[00:48:07.119 --> 00:48:07.820]  This is real.
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:11.282]  And you can track back everything I'm saying and find out it's true.
[00:48:11.342 --> 00:48:16.806]  In fact, that it's much more serious in most cases than what I'm even saying.
[00:48:19.127 --> 00:48:29.092]  So I've said my piece there, and I have gone over that information, but I have a lot of passion.
[00:48:32.013 --> 00:48:34.394]  And I rarely can articulate what I'm thinking.
[00:48:35.134 --> 00:48:42.898]  That type of speech you just heard isn't even the edge of what I understand and what I know and what I literally am in my heart.
[00:48:45.816 --> 00:48:51.877]  And all of you have that same eloquence and understanding if you just turn it loose and stop caring what other people think.
[00:48:53.397 --> 00:48:58.358]  Of all the economic news I have in this gigantic stack, it is just a huge one.
[00:48:59.078 --> 00:48:59.578]  Look at this one.
[00:48:59.958 --> 00:49:01.899]  Nine in ten UK jobs go to foreigners.
[00:49:02.279 --> 00:49:05.419]  The UK's economy is falling apart almost as fast as ours right now.
[00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:07.600]  Even though their currency isn't being debased.
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:14.001]  And they have the opposite problem because their currency is going up in value
[00:49:15.598 --> 00:49:22.880]  They are a debtor nation, and so things cost more because the value has gone up.
[00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:24.600]  It's the reverse.
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:27.261]  If you have the money and its value goes up, you're ahead.
[00:49:27.541 --> 00:49:35.403]  But if you don't have money, and now credit costs more, and the currency is worth more, so you're actually paid less of it, is the way to explain it.
[00:49:36.403 --> 00:49:46.626]  And 9 out of 10, government report, almost 9 in 10 new jobs created over the past decade have been taken by foreign-born workers, despite a sharp increase in the number of skilled British workers.
[00:49:46.746 --> 00:49:48.166]  Yeah, they're all told, go do education.
[00:49:48.446 --> 00:49:49.827]  Go pay for all these educations.
[00:49:50.307 --> 00:49:52.347]  All these different certificates, and then it's useless.
[00:49:52.927 --> 00:50:02.630]  Official figures show the number of British people in work has swum to the lowest level since labor was elected in 97, undermining claims made by Gordon Brown that employment was at record high.
[00:50:03.456 --> 00:50:10.620]  Since 1997, some 1.4 million fewer Britons work in manufacturing, yet 113,000 more foreign-born workers are in the sector.
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:20.225]  Of the 1.7 million people in employment since 1997, 1.5 million were born outside the UK, according to the Office for National Statistics.
[00:50:21.546 --> 00:50:32.372]  The figures have been uncovered by the former Labor Minister, who is urging the government to urgently restrict immigration from Eastern Europe to help young Britons gain employment.
[00:50:38.579 --> 00:50:40.361]  I'm going to leave you alone.
[00:51:01.983 --> 00:51:14.706]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in Internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:51:15.146 --> 00:51:21.848]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[00:51:22.208 --> 00:51:22.648]  We're good to go.
[00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:55.372]  We're in a no-holds-barred information war.
[00:51:55.773 --> 00:52:01.060]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[00:52:02.026 --> 00:52:06.288]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:52:06.528 --> 00:52:11.430]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:12.971]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:52:13.151 --> 00:52:16.513]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?
[00:52:16.753 --> 00:52:21.915]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% of the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.

[00:52:28.258 --> 00:52:30.700]  Now, Calvin soaps are available to you and me.
[00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:33.101]  Triple concentrated for all your cleaning needs.

[00:52:36.923 --> 00:52:37.864]  No animal testing.
[00:52:38.124 --> 00:52:41.066]  I use them and love them, knowing they're all naturally safe.
[00:52:41.346 --> 00:52:42.466]  And I say big time.

[00:53:01.898 --> 00:53:07.381]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:53:07.821 --> 00:53:12.044]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:53:12.464 --> 00:53:19.328]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:53:19.768 --> 00:53:26.475]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:53:26.796 --> 00:53:28.398]  There are no reported side effects.
[00:53:28.698 --> 00:53:31.881]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:53:32.162 --> 00:53:34.624]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.

[00:53:48.879 --> 00:53:50.640]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.
[00:54:04.295 --> 00:54:10.318]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:10.938 --> 00:54:13.920]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:19.523 --> 00:54:22.084]  Racing towards hour number two.
[00:54:22.124 --> 00:54:32.069]  In fact, John, let's just go ahead and get... John Williams, our guest, shadow government, on with us.
[00:54:34.409 --> 00:54:36.812]  Right when we start the next hour, I want to go directly into it.
[00:54:38.173 --> 00:54:41.657]  The other economic news here, not just 9 and 10 U.K.
[00:54:41.697 --> 00:54:42.878]  jobs go to foreigners.
[00:54:43.619 --> 00:54:46.682]  Oil prices are down only 105 from a high of 106.
[00:54:46.762 --> 00:54:50.085]  See, now they're telling you, oh, it's low, 105.
[00:54:51.026 --> 00:54:51.587]  See how when it was 80...
[00:54:57.110 --> 00:54:57.830]  And then it dropped down to 60.
[00:54:58.211 --> 00:54:59.191]  You go, oh, it's only 60.
[00:54:59.551 --> 00:55:00.131]  And then it went up to 90.
[00:55:00.532 --> 00:55:01.152]  And then, oh, it's only 80.
[00:55:01.412 --> 00:55:01.932]  And then it went up to 100.
[00:55:02.272 --> 00:55:04.213]  And, oh, now it's only 90 when it drops back.
[00:55:04.233 --> 00:55:04.854]  Kind of like gold.
[00:55:08.875 --> 00:55:09.296]  Shoots up to 500.
[00:55:09.776 --> 00:55:10.436]  Drops back down to 400.
[00:55:10.496 --> 00:55:11.216]  Shoots up to 600.
[00:55:11.597 --> 00:55:12.557]  Drops back down to 500.
[00:55:12.597 --> 00:55:15.058]  See how it's leapfrogging upwards?
[00:55:16.259 --> 00:55:17.159]  That's how they spin it.
[00:55:17.339 --> 00:55:18.040]  Oh, wonderful.
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:18.880]  Oil prices are down.
[00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:19.260]  Only $105 a barrel.
[00:55:22.387 --> 00:55:31.332]  Employers slash jobs, the most in five years, covered that 63,000 gone in just one month of February.
[00:55:31.473 --> 00:55:32.093]  Unbelievable.
[00:55:33.854 --> 00:55:37.116]  Private equity firm Carlyle Group's having some problems as well.
[00:55:39.297 --> 00:55:41.719]  Central banks voice concern over inflation.
[00:55:42.259 --> 00:55:48.843]  Central banks from the world's industrialized and developing regions voiced concern Friday over sagging food and energy prices.
[00:55:49.383 --> 00:55:50.484]  Surging, not sagging.
[00:55:50.824 --> 00:55:51.885]  Freudian slip, I wish they were
[00:55:52.489 --> 00:55:52.849]  Sagging.
[00:55:53.610 --> 00:56:00.334]  Their latest big challenge is globalization unsettles the balance of supply and demand, which they engineered.
[00:56:00.354 --> 00:56:05.818]  Another big thing about central banks want more credit issued when they're the ones restricting it, after they created the bubble.
[00:56:07.719 --> 00:56:09.941]  And it goes on from there.
[00:56:10.321 --> 00:56:15.364]  Then they have headlines about, as unemployment surges, fears that we might enter a recession.
[00:56:16.985 --> 00:56:18.726]  Kind of like when somebody's had their head chopped off.
[00:56:18.806 --> 00:56:19.667]  Fears he might have...
[00:56:21.624 --> 00:56:22.645]  Cutting self-shaving.
[00:56:23.987 --> 00:56:25.369]  Fears that we might be entering.
[00:56:28.672 --> 00:56:29.794]  Cutting our self-shaving.
[00:56:32.016 --> 00:56:38.284]  We told you about food exploding in prices, but eFoods Direct has it locked in at the prices from a few months ago.
[00:56:39.224 --> 00:56:44.327]  And this food has been freshly freeze-dried and dried just in the last few weeks.
[00:56:44.928 --> 00:56:46.229]  Prices will go up again, though.
[00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:49.411]  Wheat is now four times what it was just a month ago.
[00:56:49.491 --> 00:56:49.911]  It doubled.
[00:56:50.251 --> 00:56:52.252]  And it's down four times last time I checked yesterday.
[00:56:53.473 --> 00:56:56.075]  But this is high-quality, storable foods.
[00:56:56.195 --> 00:57:01.018]  And if we go into an even bigger crisis, it's good to have insurance you can eat no matter what happens.
[00:57:01.058 --> 00:57:02.579]  And this is high-quality, tasty food.
[00:57:03.431 --> 00:57:04.471]  None of it is GMO.
[00:57:04.571 --> 00:57:05.872]  It is all healthy and good.
[00:57:06.312 --> 00:57:07.612]  Give eFoods Direct a call.
[00:57:07.632 --> 00:57:07.812]  800-409-5633.
[00:57:07.832 --> 00:57:08.112]  800-409-5633.
[00:57:08.652 --> 00:57:16.475]  Or check them out online at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:57:16.495 --> 00:57:21.956]  Big fat banners at the top of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:57:23.577 --> 00:57:27.578]  Also, I want to tell you about Aloe's Body Cleanse.
[00:57:28.918 --> 00:57:30.478]  Aloe vera is up there with hemp.
[00:57:30.658 --> 00:57:32.559]  It's just one of those superfoods.
[00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:42.847]  It's used all over the world and it is known for detoxifying, totally cleaning out your intestinal tract, but detoxifying the body as a whole.
[00:57:43.387 --> 00:57:46.009]  Massive mainline medical research on aloe vera.
[00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:48.991]  It's a component of hundreds of mainline drugs.
[00:57:49.332 --> 00:57:53.395]  This is just raw aloe vera with some other well-known herbs for cleansing the body.
[00:57:54.315 --> 00:57:55.957]  Aloe is colon and body cleanse.
[00:57:55.997 --> 00:57:56.657]  Give them a call at 1-800-569-4056.
[00:58:00.137 --> 00:58:02.598]  Eloise, Body Cleanse, 1-800-569-4056.

[00:59:04.348 --> 00:59:05.268]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.908 --> 00:59:09.549]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.109 --> 00:59:14.230]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.330 --> 00:59:26.392]  Coming up after the break, we're going to play a clip of John Williams...
[00:59:27.762 --> 00:59:37.792]  Economist, forecaster, being interviewed on CNN talking about inflationary depression coming up.
[00:59:38.753 --> 00:59:41.196]  We're lining out some phone line issues now.
[00:59:42.197 --> 00:59:44.459]  Getting things to network phones, we're having so many problems.
[00:59:45.554 --> 00:59:50.235]  But John Williams with a BA in economics and an MBA both from Dartmouth.
[00:59:50.555 --> 00:59:54.976]  He serves as an economic consultant both to private industries and Fortune 500 companies.
[00:59:55.376 --> 01:00:00.018]  For more than 20 years he writes on his website shadowstats.com.
[01:00:00.458 --> 01:00:08.680]  I have been a practicing consultant, economist, and out of necessity has become a specialist in government economic reporting because they're very deceptive about that.
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:10.860]  And that's why he joins us today.
[01:00:13.461 --> 01:00:14.641]  Do we have Mr. Williams now?
[01:00:15.501 --> 01:00:16.121]  Fantastic.
[01:00:16.181 --> 01:00:17.842]  Mr. Williams, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:00:18.582 --> 01:00:19.022]  My pleasure.
[01:00:20.083 --> 01:00:31.708]  Mr. Williams, we've got a quick segment here, but just introduce yourself to us for those that don't know about shadowstats.com and why you had to get into really having to crack government numbers and find out what's really happening.
[01:00:33.348 --> 01:00:44.573]  I've been a consulting economist for more than 25 years, and I found early on that if I wanted to put out meaningful forecasts as to what was going to happen in the economy or the financial markets,
[01:00:45.475 --> 01:01:13.826]  That I fully had to understand what was in the government numbers, and the more I dealt into it, the more I found that the numbers were not quite as represented, and in fact, over the last couple of decades, in the period of time in which I've been involved in it, the ways that key series like the CPI and the GDP, the unemployment rate, how they're calculated has been changed over time, with the general effect of putting an upside bias into the
[01:01:15.141 --> 01:01:20.245]  Estimates of economic growth and a downside bias into the estimates of inflation.
[01:01:21.766 --> 01:01:38.136]  And so what I did a couple of years back was to start the current website, shadowstats.com, where I assess where the numbers would be in terms of common experience and the more traditional methodologies.
[01:01:38.517 --> 01:01:41.539]  You'd find that the CPI instead of...
[01:01:43.517 --> 01:01:54.740]  Being around 4.3% as the government's estimating it right now is in the 7% to 11% range, depending upon whether or not you look at the methodology of 1990 or 1980.
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:58.940]  And I think most people would find that is closer to their experience.
[01:01:59.361 --> 01:02:03.861]  Well, there are other groups that look at, say, inflation, and they were saying 12%, 13% last year.
[01:02:04.482 --> 01:02:06.502]  They're talking about 15% this year.
[01:02:06.882 --> 01:02:10.523]  But the Fed was just six months ago still trying to say inflation was at 2%.
[01:02:11.935 --> 01:02:15.416]  Yeah, that's their game.
[01:02:16.256 --> 01:02:19.917]  They think they have to report a low inflation rate.
[01:02:20.697 --> 01:02:36.020]  Mr. Bernanke, if you go back in time a little bit, I mean, last year was touting how it really was up to the Fed to keep inflationary expectations low, that the expectations were what drove inflation.
[01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:41.121]  Well, expectations may have an impact on it, but there are other factors such as
[01:02:42.162 --> 01:02:43.543]  And if something includes...
[01:03:07.785 --> 01:03:12.315]  And if something in food and energy goes up, they take that part of energy out and then stick something else in.
[01:03:12.356 --> 01:03:13.037]  We're about to break.
[01:03:13.057 --> 01:03:13.719]  When we come back...
[01:03:14.452 --> 01:03:28.922]  I want to walk through how they cook the books, what the real numbers are from what you've gotten, what other economists and people studying this have gotten, and then where you think all this is leading with your forecast of going into dangerous inflationary depression.
[01:03:29.002 --> 01:03:39.549]  What an inflationary depression is, or what type of depression that would be, and the duration of that economic forecast.
[01:03:40.089 --> 01:03:42.491]  So we'll be right back with our guest.
[01:03:42.531 --> 01:03:43.592]  He's highly respected.
[01:03:43.652 --> 01:03:43.932]  Walter...
[01:03:44.927 --> 01:03:46.789]  Jay, that's Walter John Williams.
[01:03:47.689 --> 01:03:50.972]  And we're going to come back and play a little clip of him from CNN.
[01:03:50.992 --> 01:03:51.553]  Stay with us.

[01:04:55.731 --> 01:04:59.195]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:04:59.356 --> 01:05:01.618]  But in liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:05:01.818 --> 01:05:04.561]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:05:04.902 --> 01:05:10.388]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.

[01:06:53.382 --> 01:06:59.325]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:02.609 --> 01:07:09.791]  In the last week, we brought you one of the chief economists at the New York School of Business saying we're going into a probable depression.
[01:07:09.831 --> 01:07:11.092]  We're already in a deep recession.
[01:07:11.692 --> 01:07:15.893]  We brought you Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, father of Reaganomics, former head of Treasury.
[01:07:16.813 --> 01:07:19.534]  Also, Wall Street Journal editors saying basically the same thing.
[01:07:19.554 --> 01:07:23.055]  Joseph Stiklitz, Nobel Prize winner, former chief economist, World Bank.
[01:07:23.815 --> 01:07:27.717]  They're all basically saying the same thing, and we're bringing you another individual.
[01:07:27.757 --> 01:07:29.177]  We're just bringing you all the top names.
[01:07:30.353 --> 01:07:38.558]  It's hard now to find actual people that have had good track records that aren't saying we're going into a serious deepening recession and maybe even a depression.
[01:07:39.058 --> 01:07:44.401]  And we've got John Williams from ShadowStats.com who does just an amazing job.
[01:07:44.861 --> 01:07:50.764]  I've been following him for the last few years and many others for a lot longer than that at forecasting what's really happening in the economy.
[01:07:52.424 --> 01:08:00.806]  Extracting real numbers and kind of reverse engineering the disinfo that the government agencies and both parties are putting out about the economy.
[01:08:01.166 --> 01:08:03.866]  This is what CNN was saying about Mr. Williams the other day.
[01:08:04.406 --> 01:08:10.167]  John Williams at ShadowStats.com says about what's coming down the road.
[01:08:11.068 --> 01:08:11.628]  Where are we going?
[01:08:12.448 --> 01:08:17.809]  We have a severe recession ahead of us with even higher inflation than we're seeing now.
[01:08:17.869 --> 01:08:18.489]  It's going to be the
[01:08:19.210 --> 01:08:23.495]  Probably the worst business cycle seen since the Great Depression.
[01:08:24.015 --> 01:08:34.186]  I wouldn't want to be the president in the 2012 election because whoever wins this upcoming one is going to take blame for a real bad economy.
[01:08:35.558 --> 01:08:38.059]  So with that kind of a prediction, did you hear that?
[01:08:38.159 --> 01:08:41.941]  An inflationary depression is coming down the road.
[01:08:42.421 --> 01:08:45.062]  And my first impression with that was, wow, what do we do?
[01:08:45.202 --> 01:08:47.743]  I'm not the kind of guy that goes down the air and tells people what to do.
[01:08:47.923 --> 01:08:54.826]  But listen to what John Williams says, and he makes these predictions to Fortune 500 companies and hedge funds around the country.
[01:08:55.066 --> 01:09:01.528]  This is the guy who gets paid for his advice, and we're lucky enough to get him on CNN to tell you what to do with your money.
[01:09:01.769 --> 01:09:03.329]  Listen to what he says you should do.
[01:09:04.250 --> 01:09:05.090]  It's a bad time.
[01:09:05.973 --> 01:09:06.894]  We're good to go.
[01:09:24.972 --> 01:09:32.276]  Now, you know what, Robert Shiller at Yale University, the famous economics professor up there who does the K. Shiller Report, amazingly, he says the same thing.
[01:09:32.536 --> 01:09:35.358]  So does Nero Rubini over at NYU, saying the same thing.
[01:09:35.498 --> 01:09:36.258]  These aren't a bunch of kooks.
[01:09:36.278 --> 01:09:37.579]  These are guys who are educated.
[01:09:37.859 --> 01:09:42.082]  These are guys who are looking far out into the economy that say, look out, there's a big pie coming in your face.
[01:09:43.812 --> 01:09:44.833]  Craig, let me ask you a question.
[01:09:45.233 --> 01:09:50.035]  I was listening, you know, the other day when President Bush made his speech, Ben Bernanke was testifying before Congress for a second day.
[01:09:50.055 --> 01:09:51.336]  I was listening to Bernanke speaking.
[01:09:51.856 --> 01:09:53.397]  Senators were asking about inflation.
[01:09:53.597 --> 01:10:02.461]  Everybody in America, certainly in Texas, spent this week talking about inflation and how serious it was in 2007 and how bread and milk and cheese and gas and all of that is more expensive.
[01:10:02.501 --> 01:10:07.103]  And Ben Bernanke with a straight face said to Congress, no, no, core inflation is quite contained.
[01:10:07.163 --> 01:10:08.504]  In fact, it's under 3%.
[01:10:08.964 --> 01:10:11.425]  Core inflation, as we've all talked about, is inflation that...
[01:10:11.485 --> 01:10:15.188]  All right, going back to John Williams, who you just heard from shadowstats.com.
[01:10:17.289 --> 01:10:23.534]  John, do you want to get into how they cook the stats first, or do you want to just get into the forecast of where you see this country going?
[01:10:24.375 --> 01:10:31.880]  Well, let me get into how they cook the stats, because that, I think, affects the credibility of where I believe they are and where we are going.
[01:10:34.782 --> 01:10:38.085]  Again, there are actually two types of manipulations.
[01:10:38.789 --> 01:10:46.654]  The one which has the greatest impact over time is where there are methodological changes made in the way the numbers are put together.
[01:10:48.075 --> 01:10:57.800]  And the second way is where you have an occasional direct manipulation aimed at changing a particular number for political purposes or otherwise.
[01:10:58.641 --> 01:11:05.685]  To give you an example, in the first case, with the consumer price index, a very key point, really the most insidious,
[01:11:06.488 --> 01:11:14.132]  Change I've seen in any of these numbers goes back before Bill Clinton.
[01:11:15.733 --> 01:11:30.621]  Michael Boskin, who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors under Bush, and Alan Greenspan, then the Fed chairman, started arguing about how the CPI, the Consumer Price Index, was overstating inflation.
[01:11:31.981 --> 01:11:34.903]  And if you listen to their arguments, what they were saying is, well...
[01:11:35.683 --> 01:11:45.726]  You know, the inflation measure reflects the price of steak, but let's say steak goes up too much in price, people are going to start buying hamburgers.
[01:11:46.206 --> 01:11:53.528]  So really, you know, if the price of steak goes up, we should replace steak with hamburgers, and that would give you a more reasonable estimate of the cost of living.
[01:11:54.148 --> 01:11:56.549]  That's not the concept of the Consumer Price Index.
[01:11:57.189 --> 01:12:02.311]  If you go back to after World War II, the Consumer Price Index goes way back in time.
[01:12:03.865 --> 01:12:22.228]  When the CPI was used in the auto union contracts, the concept, very simply, and I'm being very simplistic here, would be, let's say we take the price of a gallon of milk, a steak, a loaf of bread, maybe a gallon of gas, we price those out.
[01:12:22.848 --> 01:12:31.530]  Next year, we price those same commodities out, and you compare the prices, and that's how much your income had to go up if you wanted to maintain a constant standard of living.
[01:12:32.188 --> 01:12:37.730]  The concept was, what's my cost of living of maintaining a constant standard of living?
[01:12:38.830 --> 01:12:48.893]  What they were proposing pre-Quentin is shifting to a basis where the weightings are based on substitution.
[01:12:49.633 --> 01:12:53.674]  So the steak goes up, you replace it with hamburger.
[01:12:53.854 --> 01:12:56.815]  That's not maintaining a constant standard of living.
[01:12:57.395 --> 01:13:00.616]  That's really more a cost of survival.
[01:13:01.731 --> 01:13:05.874]  And what was not the concept behind the CPI, and obviously it's much lower.
[01:13:06.475 --> 01:13:13.860]  If something goes up in price and you replace it with something that's of lower quality... So they should call it the Survival Price Index.
[01:13:14.581 --> 01:13:14.861]  Yeah.
[01:13:15.021 --> 01:13:20.125]  Now, they didn't actually put it into full play the way Boskin and Greenspan were advocating.
[01:13:20.165 --> 01:13:26.810]  And the reason they gave for this was, oh my goodness, you know, if we only could bring down the cost of the level of the CPI...
[01:13:28.125 --> 01:13:33.268]  We could reduce entitlement payments on the cost of living adjustments on Social Security and such.
[01:13:33.548 --> 01:13:44.094]  That was their purpose behind it, which would be a way of reducing Social Security payments without anyone in Congress ever having to vote against Social Security.
[01:13:44.514 --> 01:13:46.895]  Very politically dangerous situation.
[01:13:49.076 --> 01:13:56.000]  There was enough here that everyone sort of backed off that, but after Clinton became president, the Bureau of Labor Statistics
[01:13:57.049 --> 01:14:05.414]  ...changed the way they weighted the CPI in a way that they said mimicked the substitution-based concept.
[01:14:05.815 --> 01:14:19.403]  And because of that, right now, what is 4.3% inflation would be around 7.5% inflation if they hadn't made that change.
[01:14:20.004 --> 01:14:22.525]  Social security checks would be double what they are today.
[01:14:22.545 --> 01:14:25.247]  I mean, the effect's cumulative over time.
[01:14:26.396 --> 01:14:27.938]  Let me stop you right there.
[01:14:28.258 --> 01:14:36.384]  Mr. Williams, let me just stop you there with that one example, because you're just calmly reporting on this, and that's important, but let's break down the incredible statement you just made.
[01:14:36.864 --> 01:14:48.993]  Since, what, the mid-1990s, and that's what our other experts have basically been saying, Social Security checks for what we've paid in and for the real index should be double what they are.
[01:14:49.113 --> 01:14:51.214]  Instead, the checks are going up 2-3% a year,
[01:14:52.635 --> 01:14:57.439]  And it goes beyond that to people that have union contracts or wage agreements that are tied to the CPI.
[01:14:57.820 --> 01:14:57.940]  It's...
[01:15:19.944 --> 01:15:26.759]  It is widespread and it's one reason that people find or the average household finds that they can't make ends meet.
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:28.443]  That's a common problem.
[01:15:28.866 --> 01:15:34.249]  But the news media, at least until now, would say, oh, well, it's a recession if you're out of work.
[01:15:34.290 --> 01:15:37.371]  It's a depression if everybody's out of work.
[01:15:37.712 --> 01:15:41.154]  Or it's a recession when your neighbor's out of work, and it's a depression when you're out of work.
[01:15:42.014 --> 01:15:45.277]  And they've just kept saying the last few years, everything's fine, everything's wonderful.
[01:15:45.537 --> 01:15:48.559]  You know, it's a conspiracy theory to say that things are getting more expensive.
[01:15:48.779 --> 01:15:50.420]  But now they can't cover it up anymore.
[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:51.300]  That's right.
[01:15:52.981 --> 01:15:53.642]  Indeed, they can't.
[01:15:53.722 --> 01:15:55.363]  I mean, even the core inflation is...
[01:15:57.166 --> 01:16:00.188]  Mr. Bernanke likes to look at the lowest rate.
[01:16:00.328 --> 01:16:02.349]  Even that is starting to move higher.
[01:16:02.369 --> 01:16:04.230]  And for good reason.
[01:16:04.410 --> 01:16:10.774]  I mean, a lot of the inflation we've seen in the last year or two has been tied to the extraordinary surge in the price of oil.
[01:16:11.434 --> 01:16:12.935]  Oil is not just gasoline.
[01:16:13.456 --> 01:16:16.537]  The effect of oil prices permeates the economy.
[01:16:16.698 --> 01:16:18.559]  Plastics, shipping, everything.
[01:16:19.179 --> 01:16:19.759]  Yeah, everything.
[01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:24.422]  Including pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, and indeed the transportation.
[01:16:24.822 --> 01:16:26.103]  Anything that gets transported.
[01:16:27.882 --> 01:16:30.963]  And that's... They've been very slow picking that up.
[01:16:31.123 --> 01:16:37.604]  Now, of course, most of oil, sir, and tell me if I'm wrong, most of oil's increase, if you're buying in euros, oil hasn't really gone up.
[01:16:37.984 --> 01:16:39.524]  But if you're buying in dollars, it has.
[01:16:39.604 --> 01:16:50.106]  Isn't it dollar devaluation that has triggered... It's most sharply in dollars because, among other things, dollars are plummeting right now.
[01:16:50.286 --> 01:16:52.166]  And there's a dollar's drop.
[01:16:53.407 --> 01:16:54.987]  It becomes cheaper for people...
[01:16:56.202 --> 01:17:03.806]  Let's say who live to dominate in euros or Swiss francs or yen to buy oil in dollars.
[01:17:03.886 --> 01:17:05.126]  It's becoming cheaper for it.
[01:17:05.667 --> 01:17:08.268]  But that has a counter effect in the marketplace.
[01:17:08.368 --> 01:17:09.409]  It's sort of an imbalance.
[01:17:09.449 --> 01:17:14.131]  And the effect is it tends to spike oil prices, which we're seeing now.
[01:17:14.151 --> 01:17:19.053]  I mean, one reason oil prices are rising is because the dollar is dropping in value.
[01:17:19.934 --> 01:17:21.374]  And I wouldn't be surprised.
[01:17:21.794 --> 01:17:22.775]  I mean, they've already been
[01:17:24.046 --> 01:17:32.795]  Rumblings about it, but not too far down the road you see OPEC abandon the dollar as the method of evaluation.
[01:17:33.416 --> 01:17:39.862]  Well, yes, in the last 12 days, we've seen the dollar's biggest drop in modern history.
[01:17:40.302 --> 01:17:44.206]  And I said Monday, when we learned about it last Monday, that it was going to happen.
[01:17:44.246 --> 01:17:45.388]  It wasn't hard for me to figure out.
[01:17:45.468 --> 01:17:46.629]  And finally, mainstream news...
[01:17:47.109 --> 01:17:49.070]  This goes back to the Nixon administration.
[01:17:49.090 --> 01:17:51.812]  As I understand it, Arthur Burns, who was Fed Chairman at that time,
[01:18:17.409 --> 01:18:17.930]  We're good to go.
[01:18:38.217 --> 01:18:40.958]  We've seen that happen when the stock market crashed in 87.
[01:18:41.558 --> 01:18:41.998]  Stay there.
[01:18:42.118 --> 01:18:42.898]  Stay there, sir.
[01:18:42.938 --> 01:18:48.780]  I want to talk about market fundamentals, how they're manipulating the numbers, and where you forecast this economy is going.
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:53.101]  We'll be right back with our guest, John Williams, shadowstats.com.
[01:18:54.082 --> 01:18:55.482]  It is a big idea.
[01:18:55.502 --> 01:18:57.603]  A new world order.
[01:18:58.323 --> 01:19:02.604]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by powerful governments.
[01:19:03.214 --> 01:19:04.975]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[01:19:05.175 --> 01:19:08.276]  Wouldn't their objective be world domination?
[01:19:08.816 --> 01:19:11.278]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:19:11.998 --> 01:19:19.341]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:19:22.339 --> 01:19:27.343]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:19:27.743 --> 01:19:31.266]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:19:31.686 --> 01:19:34.188]  Don't worry, it's making great progress for the world government.
[01:19:34.248 --> 01:19:35.189]  Most people have no idea.
[01:19:35.209 --> 01:19:36.170]  They're not after money.
[01:19:36.190 --> 01:19:37.271]  They have all the money they need.
[01:19:37.451 --> 01:19:38.212]  They're after power.
[01:19:38.452 --> 01:19:39.152]  That's what happens.

[01:19:51.125 --> 01:19:52.156]  You have been warned.
[01:19:53.101 --> 01:19:53.762]  It's a fact.
[01:19:53.962 --> 01:20:01.447]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[01:20:01.567 --> 01:20:10.453]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[01:20:10.713 --> 01:20:21.260]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecure debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:27.564]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[01:20:27.784 --> 01:20:32.807]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[01:20:32.988 --> 01:20:37.490]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.

[01:21:56.848 --> 01:22:00.249]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:22:00.430 --> 01:22:03.931]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:22:04.171 --> 01:22:07.492]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:22:07.572 --> 01:22:12.913]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.

[01:22:53.539 --> 01:22:57.300]  Everybody knows that the days are loaded.
[01:22:57.580 --> 01:23:00.181]  Everybody rolls with them fingers crossed.
[01:23:00.421 --> 01:23:02.461]  Everybody knows the war is over.
[01:23:02.481 --> 01:23:04.241]  Everybody knows the good guys lost.
[01:23:20.347 --> 01:23:26.438]  Okay, I want to talk with our guest more about how they cook the books, but more importantly, we know he's the expert on that.
[01:23:27.288 --> 01:23:35.610]  What he forecasts in the future, that talk of inflationary depression, and then how we can pull out of this in his educated opinion.
[01:23:35.630 --> 01:23:49.593]  We don't hear any candidate but Ron Paul from Democrats or Republicans talking about the inflation tax, talking about how Social Security recipients in the last 15 years, really 12 years, have had their check really cut in half for purchasing power.
[01:23:51.716 --> 01:23:53.397]  You talk about depression.
[01:23:53.417 --> 01:23:54.818]  You talk about inflationary depression.
[01:23:55.278 --> 01:23:58.440]  Give us your forecast on will it just be a deep recession?
[01:23:58.500 --> 01:23:59.020]  How long?
[01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:01.181]  Or is it going to turn into an inflationary depression?
[01:24:02.402 --> 01:24:05.103]  Well, we're already in an inflationary recession.
[01:24:06.144 --> 01:24:14.388]  And it's just a matter of depth and also level of inflation that makes it hyperinflationary depression.
[01:24:15.468 --> 01:24:17.870]  Let me make a couple of points up front.
[01:24:19.250 --> 01:24:20.551]  One is to define the depression.
[01:24:21.412 --> 01:24:23.794]  You won't find a standard definition around.
[01:24:23.814 --> 01:24:28.617]  It used to be that prior to the Great Depression that every downturn was called a depression.
[01:24:29.578 --> 01:24:34.641]  And if you plotted out the level of economic activity, it would sort of dip like a bowl.
[01:24:35.722 --> 01:24:41.766]  And after the Great Depression, the idea was to come up with a euphemism for depression.
[01:24:42.307 --> 01:24:46.350]  And the down part of the line going into the bowl was called a recession.
[01:24:47.150 --> 01:24:49.792]  So they changed the name of a depression to a recession.
[01:24:51.052 --> 01:24:59.615]  Some decades back, I talked to a number of people throughout the government and private sector, trying to put this into perspective and how it could be defined.
[01:25:00.315 --> 01:25:19.581]  Generally, a recession, despite some protestations to the contrary, that's usually defined as two consecutive quarters of declining growth in the gross domestic product, which is the broadest measure of economic activity adjusted for inflation.
[01:25:21.024 --> 01:25:27.249]  A depression would be a decline from the peak of economic activity to the trough of greater than 10%.
[01:25:28.770 --> 01:25:31.192]  We haven't had one like that since the Great Depression.
[01:25:31.813 --> 01:25:36.977]  And a Great Depression would be a decline of greater than 20% from peak to trough.
[01:25:37.538 --> 01:25:40.700]  How close are we to that?
[01:25:43.242 --> 01:25:47.346]  If you had an accurate measure of the GDP, which we don't,
[01:25:49.459 --> 01:25:53.420]  You'd be right now about halfway into a depression.
[01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:55.260]  You'd be down about 5%.
[01:25:55.700 --> 01:25:58.021]  Good God, and they say this recession is just starting.
[01:25:58.381 --> 01:26:02.802]  On average, the top economists and forecasters we have on say a three-year recession.
[01:26:03.082 --> 01:26:09.583]  If it continues to recess, and like you said, goes down as much as it's already fallen, then that will be a depression.
[01:26:09.843 --> 01:26:14.084]  And I would imagine if it's going to be a three-year recession, that's going to be called a deep depression.
[01:26:15.566 --> 01:26:17.828]  Well, how it's going to be called remains to be seen.
[01:26:17.868 --> 01:26:20.809]  Those definitions I gave you are mine.
[01:26:20.890 --> 01:26:22.310]  There's nothing published out there.
[01:26:22.871 --> 01:26:25.452]  Someone will eventually get around to addressing the issue.
[01:26:25.552 --> 01:26:28.194]  So basically we'll have a depression and they'll never say we had one.
[01:26:28.354 --> 01:26:32.757]  They'll just say it's a recession if it really is a depression.
[01:26:33.517 --> 01:26:39.661]  Yeah, well, we've had recessions that have disappeared and the government's redefinitioned.
[01:26:39.701 --> 01:26:42.742]  But what you have in play here is a problem that started back in the 1970s.
[01:26:44.991 --> 01:27:01.917]  If you go back 30 years, and you look at what the government publishes in terms of average real weekly earnings, that means what the average person earns in a week adjusted for inflation, you're down 20-30% from where you were back in 1970.
[01:27:03.698 --> 01:27:11.541]  And the difference that makes is that back in 1970, on average, the husband at work, the wife would stay home with the kids.
[01:27:12.293 --> 01:27:14.815]  I want to get into the causes and then the solutions, but...
[01:27:32.339 --> 01:27:41.347]  What you're saying is, just as a layman, what I've observed, true standard of living for 30 years has been dropping for the average family, for the average individual.
[01:27:41.647 --> 01:27:47.632]  So really, we've been in one long recession, now culminating in what could be an economic collapse?
[01:27:48.212 --> 01:27:49.593]  Yeah, that's about it.
[01:27:49.713 --> 01:27:51.235]  It's a structural change.
[01:27:52.275 --> 01:27:57.179]  You can't turn it around with some finagling with interest rates by the Fed.
[01:27:58.561 --> 01:27:59.281]  It's protracted.
[01:27:59.301 --> 01:28:00.022]  It's very deep.
[01:28:01.007 --> 01:28:01.868]  We're in it.
[01:28:02.208 --> 01:28:03.510]  It's going to become a depression.
[01:28:03.890 --> 01:28:05.633]  I think it's going to become a Great Depression.
[01:28:05.653 --> 01:28:13.982]  But unlike the Great Depression back in the 30s, where you had a severe deflation, prices dropped.
[01:28:15.104 --> 01:28:16.525]  Here we're going to have inflation.
[01:28:16.566 --> 01:28:17.647]  We already have inflation.
[01:28:18.263 --> 01:28:21.925]  But it's going to become a hyperinflation, in my definition of a hyperinflation.
[01:28:21.965 --> 01:28:23.706]  This is not next week.
[01:28:23.726 --> 01:28:26.247]  This is down the road a year or two.
[01:28:26.487 --> 01:28:27.108]  Got to break again.
[01:28:27.128 --> 01:28:28.368]  I got to hear this on the other side.
[01:28:28.468 --> 01:28:29.009]  Quick break.
[01:28:29.109 --> 01:28:30.429]  Back with our guest.
[01:28:30.449 --> 01:28:31.990]  We'll take a few calls for him.
[01:28:32.010 --> 01:28:33.971]  If you have quick questions at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:28:33.991 --> 01:28:34.932]  Only on the subject of the economy.
[01:28:35.032 --> 01:28:35.832]  We're on the march.
[01:28:35.852 --> 01:28:37.113]  The empire's on the run.

[01:28:54.804 --> 01:28:58.185]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:28:58.325 --> 01:29:03.526]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:29:03.706 --> 01:29:08.488]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:29:08.768 --> 01:29:19.891]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:29:20.191 --> 01:29:20.972]  We're good to go.
[01:29:50.111 --> 01:29:50.451]  I think.
[01:30:12.312 --> 01:30:13.113]  We're good to go.
[01:30:38.271 --> 01:30:41.332]  Clear skin and health in every aspect of your being.

[01:31:58.687 --> 01:32:00.568]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:32:01.089 --> 01:32:03.930]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:11.135 --> 01:32:12.956]  Final segment with our guest.
[01:32:14.730 --> 01:32:16.632]  A lot of the stuff on the site is free.
[01:32:16.652 --> 01:32:21.576]  He also has a subscription there that I suggest you get if you have any brain in your head.
[01:32:21.616 --> 01:32:26.541]  He consults for some of the biggest Fortune 500 companies who want real numbers, real stats.
[01:32:26.981 --> 01:32:28.823]  Shadowstats.com.
[01:32:29.223 --> 01:32:32.166]  Being ignorant is a good way to lose everything you've got, folks.
[01:32:33.187 --> 01:32:35.549]  We know now these people operate, and we're sitting pretty here.
[01:32:35.629 --> 01:32:36.310]  What about you?
[01:32:37.291 --> 01:32:37.651]  All right?
[01:32:37.851 --> 01:32:39.513]  The country is just basically...
[01:32:40.578 --> 01:32:41.198]  On the rocks.
[01:32:41.638 --> 01:32:45.039]  I want to ask our guest how we get out of that, in his opinion, or there is a way.
[01:32:45.599 --> 01:33:08.443]  But he was just now saying that we've been in a recessionary slide since the 70s, but now there's a systematic change in the whole system coming to a head, he said, in the next year or two that fits with sticklets, that fits with people from totally different economic views and camps, that fits with Roberts, it fits with everybody else we've met.
[01:33:09.003 --> 01:33:11.785]  I think the establishment media pretty much follows what they hear from Wall Street.
[01:33:11.805 --> 01:33:13.046]  That tends to be the common source of information.
[01:33:13.066 --> 01:33:13.646]  And you'll never get a...
[01:33:36.821 --> 01:33:40.203]  And they give you the economy or what's happening from Wall Street.
[01:33:40.223 --> 01:33:41.024]  I can't say never.
[01:33:41.064 --> 01:33:51.230]  I mean, there are a couple of people that will give you a straight view, but generally Wall Street has to sell product, and they're not going to put out information that kills your business.
[01:33:51.450 --> 01:33:52.271]  Okay, let's move quick.
[01:33:52.291 --> 01:33:53.852]  Let's go back to where we were before the break.
[01:33:54.212 --> 01:34:01.457]  You said a hyperinflation, deep depression within the next two years is what you see.
[01:34:01.937 --> 01:34:04.138]  I see the possibility.
[01:34:04.378 --> 01:34:05.099]  Just clarify that.
[01:34:05.580 --> 01:34:07.822]  We are now in an inflationary recession.
[01:34:07.842 --> 01:34:09.363]  I mean, you've got inflation on the rise.
[01:34:09.823 --> 01:34:12.045]  You've got the economy in a tumble.
[01:34:12.305 --> 01:34:14.286]  I mean, there's a sharp drop in employment.
[01:34:14.306 --> 01:34:15.327]  It was reported today.
[01:34:15.808 --> 01:34:16.868]  All sorts of indicators.
[01:34:16.888 --> 01:34:18.610]  That is happening right now.
[01:34:19.630 --> 01:34:24.014]  I'm looking for the downturn in the economy to deepen, to actually become a depression.
[01:34:24.574 --> 01:34:35.102]  And on the inflation front, inflation, and it's from the inflation standpoint turning to hyperinflation, that I'm talking two years, maybe more,
[01:34:35.683 --> 01:34:36.883]  Plus or minus.
[01:34:37.663 --> 01:34:44.645]  This is the ultimate disaster that unfolds, but I don't see any way out of it, and I'll explain why.
[01:34:46.165 --> 01:34:54.747]  When I talk about hyperinflation, I'm talking about an inflation so powerful that the dollar effectively becomes worthless.
[01:34:54.787 --> 01:35:02.789]  You can take a $100 bill, and it'll be worth more as a functional piece of toilet paper than it will be as currency.
[01:35:03.209 --> 01:35:04.069]  That's my definition.
[01:35:06.909 --> 01:35:09.291]  To the price of toilet paper.
[01:35:10.132 --> 01:35:13.375]  It'll be worth more as toilet paper than as a $100 bill.
[01:35:13.455 --> 01:35:13.995]  Good God.
[01:35:14.536 --> 01:35:15.977]  That's how bad it gets.
[01:35:16.157 --> 01:35:19.941]  We're talking about Weimar Republic-level inflation.
[01:35:20.601 --> 01:35:21.062]  Exactly.
[01:35:21.402 --> 01:35:30.450]  And this has been set up over the decades by both Republican and Democrat administrations.
[01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:31.091]  There's no one...
[01:35:33.489 --> 01:35:35.030]  Culpable party here.
[01:35:35.070 --> 01:35:36.870]  They're all involved in it.
[01:35:37.050 --> 01:35:51.253]  And the issue, and it actually, it's interesting how these things work out, but right now the government is required by law to publish financial statements as though it were a corporation using generally accepted accounting principles.
[01:35:51.313 --> 01:35:58.775]  And when you do that, and you look at them carefully, what they're telling you is the deficit isn't $200 billion or $300 billion or $160 billion.
[01:36:01.718 --> 01:36:03.399]  It's around $4 trillion.
[01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:14.187]  The reason for that is the amount of what they call unfunded liabilities that are being taken on year after year with Social Security and Medicare.
[01:36:14.887 --> 01:36:20.712]  And putting that $4 trillion number in perspective, that's the shortfall in one year.
[01:36:20.772 --> 01:36:22.273]  That's what we're losing each year.
[01:36:23.954 --> 01:36:28.097]  If you wanted to reverse that, let's say you wanted to balance the real budget,
[01:36:29.958 --> 01:36:39.384]  You could raise taxes to take 100% of wages, salaries, corporate profits, and the government still would be in deficit.
[01:36:39.945 --> 01:36:50.231]  I remember 10 years ago seeing Wall Street Journal articles about that current expenditures, they talked about by 2010, 83% of your paycheck for taxes.
[01:36:50.591 --> 01:36:56.535]  Now you're saying 10 years later we've reached a point where it cannot be paid back a black hole of debt.
[01:36:57.076 --> 01:36:57.636]  That is correct.
[01:36:58.314 --> 01:37:12.304]  Now, the other side of it, of course, is cutting the spending, but that would mean slashing Social Security and Medicare, and you have nobody in Washington who's willing even to consider discussing that.
[01:37:12.704 --> 01:37:18.008]  And the inflation has already destroyed half the value of that Social Security check.
[01:37:18.588 --> 01:37:25.173]  Yes, well, it's going to destroy the rest of it, because nobody in Washington has the guts to face the problems.
[01:37:26.031 --> 01:37:35.935]  And the way the politicians usually handle it, and there have been similar circumstances, never this bad of the scope, with the world's reserve currency, but there have been similar circumstances in the past.
[01:37:36.675 --> 01:37:46.359]  And the way the nations usually resolve it, they don't default on their debt, they just drive up the printing prices, and they inflate, and they pay people off with worthless money.
[01:37:46.499 --> 01:37:49.840]  And it's clear they're going to... And now the world is holding...
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:54.322]  Hundreds of trillions of dollars of debt and dollars and the rest of it.
[01:37:54.362 --> 01:37:56.282]  How do you see that unraveling?
[01:37:56.302 --> 01:37:58.323]  I mean, give us a forecast of how it could.
[01:37:58.343 --> 01:38:00.724]  Well, we're beginning to see that unravel.
[01:38:00.764 --> 01:38:05.646]  That's what's frightening because aside from the...
[01:38:10.371 --> 01:38:21.834]  With our wonderful trade policies, we've pushed so much of the productive capacity offshore, we're running a terrible annual trade deficit, which is pumping excess dollars into the global system.
[01:38:21.994 --> 01:38:37.419]  And we have a lot of people outside the United States who, rather than throw it back at us and say, hey, we want to redeem it, and actually you can't redeem it against gold, but the effect would be if everyone cashed in, you'd see a sharp decline in the dollar.
[01:38:37.972 --> 01:38:44.734]  They come back and they buy treasury bills and bonds and other financial instruments.
[01:38:45.474 --> 01:38:51.456]  And the amount of money here has been so significant that it has done a lot to provide liquidity to our system.
[01:38:51.836 --> 01:38:55.858]  If you go back over the last several years and you take the net debt issuance by the U.S.
[01:38:55.898 --> 01:39:05.821]  government, that's been covered almost 100% by the influx of investment from people holding otherwise unwanted dollars.
[01:39:06.707 --> 01:39:11.948]  Now, as long as the dollar's holding its value, you know, maybe they're going to come out okay on it.
[01:39:12.548 --> 01:39:15.649]  But now we're seeing the dollar drop very sharply.
[01:39:15.949 --> 01:39:19.170]  Sir, that brings me to the $64 million question.
[01:39:19.990 --> 01:39:22.850]  Why is the Federal Reserve bad-mouthing?
[01:39:22.970 --> 01:39:25.091]  Why is Greenspan bad-mouthing the dollar?
[01:39:25.471 --> 01:39:36.073]  Why, of all we've got left, is even the fiat perceived confidence in the dollar, and they're doing everything they can to bad-mouth it while putting all their money in euros and pound and yen,
[01:39:36.973 --> 01:39:43.397]  I read the Financial Times of London six months ago saying big central banks actually want to implode our economy to consolidate it.
[01:39:43.617 --> 01:39:47.979]  But then I talked to other economists that say this is going to pull down the entire world market.
[01:39:48.659 --> 01:39:50.260]  So is there a method to the madness?
[01:39:50.340 --> 01:39:53.142]  Is this a predatory engineered implosion?
[01:39:53.422 --> 01:39:56.623]  Or are they rationalizing saying they're going to come out on top?
[01:39:56.663 --> 01:39:57.604]  What I'm getting at here is
[01:39:58.084 --> 01:39:59.305]  That's an area I can't give you a good...
[01:40:23.252 --> 01:40:32.441]  Answer two, I've heard those stories, but I can tell you that I think in terms of what's happening here, what we're seeing right now... You're just covering economic outlook, yeah.
[01:40:32.542 --> 01:40:43.913]  It's been more gross incompetence and overconfidence, a belief that the computer models could resolve everything, that they could control the system.
[01:40:45.574 --> 01:40:47.036]  From the politician's standpoint...
[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:52.501]  Not planning beyond the next election, buying votes in the near term.
[01:40:52.701 --> 01:40:55.282]  I mean, it's a system that's been running out of control.
[01:40:55.662 --> 01:40:57.922]  Short-term thoughts of greed.
[01:40:59.063 --> 01:40:59.443]  I'm sorry?
[01:40:59.943 --> 01:41:00.543]  Short-term thoughts.
[01:41:00.563 --> 01:41:01.383]  I'm a little hard of hearing.
[01:41:01.643 --> 01:41:03.184]  I'm sorry, short-term thoughts.
[01:41:04.344 --> 01:41:06.864]  Short-term thoughts in terms of what's happening?
[01:41:07.024 --> 01:41:09.125]  Well, I mean, they're doing everything according to a short-term.
[01:41:09.645 --> 01:41:13.306]  Yes, in other words, I mean, corporate America is not too much better.
[01:41:13.326 --> 01:41:16.787]  It operates on looking one quarter ahead.
[01:41:17.585 --> 01:41:22.927]  The government, they'll look at as far as the next election, which is never more than two years off.
[01:41:23.588 --> 01:41:30.731]  Okay, physically, what will it look like if we go into this inflationary depression?
[01:41:30.791 --> 01:41:34.892]  What will it look like on the streets of Main Street, USA?
[01:41:35.352 --> 01:41:39.974]  It's going to be very painful and very scary.
[01:41:40.375 --> 01:41:46.077]  I mean, I can give you an idea in terms of what's going to happen with economics, but when you get into the
[01:41:46.778 --> 01:41:55.082]  The nitty-gritty of what this does to people, I mean, it's anyone's guess as to how far certain things go.
[01:41:55.122 --> 01:42:04.206]  I can tell you that from a political standpoint, the most powerful motivation for voting is a person's pocketbook.
[01:42:04.807 --> 01:42:06.868]  That's determined more elections than anything else.
[01:42:07.268 --> 01:42:15.912]  Pocketbook issues here are going to be so severe by the next presidential election, barring revolution in the streets, I would expect a
[01:42:16.491 --> 01:42:26.033]  Significant shift in power, and it would be a good opportunity for a third party to make an offering.
[01:42:26.893 --> 01:42:32.974]  I was about to say, sir, I just brought up revolution, and the government's response then, you bring up revolution, that's the big question.
[01:42:34.834 --> 01:42:36.315]  It could happen, I don't know.
[01:42:36.935 --> 01:42:43.656]  It's the type of thing that people are going to be uncomfortable enough, and will be in enough financial pain, you'll probably see disruption to
[01:42:44.466 --> 01:42:46.887]  The normal flow of goods and commerce.
[01:42:47.728 --> 01:42:50.929]  And that's the type of thing that does lead to civil unrest.
[01:42:51.470 --> 01:42:55.572]  But how something like that works out, I'm not an expert on.
[01:42:55.712 --> 01:43:08.899]  Well, we had Lou Dobbs on yesterday for 20 minutes, and he said he sees a confrontation, whether it's physical or whatever it's going to be, because the Democrats are offering even bigger government and socialized health care when we're already bankrupt.
[01:43:09.379 --> 01:43:11.020]  Absolutely.
[01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:12.861]  There's really no chance that I see with
[01:43:13.667 --> 01:43:18.228]  Okay, so on the outside, four years... And this is one area where... I mean, to me, this would not make sense.
[01:43:18.248 --> 01:43:18.908]  And that is that...
[01:43:44.098 --> 01:43:52.081]  If the dollar becomes worthless, again, that's the biggest portion of the currency markets, the global economy.
[01:43:53.322 --> 01:43:55.543]  The whole globe is going to be in turmoil.
[01:43:56.063 --> 01:43:58.264]  Financial markets globally will be in turmoil.
[01:43:58.544 --> 01:44:00.585]  The currency system will have to be revamped.
[01:44:01.385 --> 01:44:04.386]  And you'll end up with a new currency system.
[01:44:04.406 --> 01:44:04.786]  I don't know.
[01:44:04.966 --> 01:44:07.527]  And I'm talking a global currency system.
[01:44:07.547 --> 01:44:09.368]  And how that ends up, I don't know.
[01:44:09.408 --> 01:44:11.749]  But I can tell you if they're going to try and sell it to the public.
[01:44:12.925 --> 01:44:15.366]  It's likely going to have some gold in it somewhere.
[01:44:15.787 --> 01:44:25.251]  Did you see the report a month ago by the Council on Foreign Relations released by their full committee on economics calling for a global currency to answer the dollar crisis?
[01:44:25.871 --> 01:44:27.612]  No, I didn't see that.
[01:44:31.374 --> 01:44:33.375]  I certainly wouldn't advocate a global currency.
[01:44:34.335 --> 01:44:36.756]  I mean, you've got all sorts of problems with that.
[01:44:36.776 --> 01:44:37.877]  But you see them now.
[01:44:38.637 --> 01:44:40.418]  I mean, I know there are people who would like to see...
[01:44:43.348 --> 01:44:56.203]  The world evolved into one government, but I'll contend that if you look at what's happened around the globe, that the movement of people and what people are looking for seems to be more in the other direction.
[01:44:58.628 --> 01:44:59.249]  Okay.
[01:44:59.990 --> 01:45:10.497]  Sir, we only have about five minutes left, and I want to jam in three calls, but my last question for John Williams at ShadowStats.com, then jam these calls in with quick questions, quick answers, is this.
[01:45:10.537 --> 01:45:21.406]  You said in that CNN piece, I would get into cash and a little bit of gold, but if cash is going down to toilet paper value, why wouldn't you fully get in to a portfolio of different metals?
[01:45:22.106 --> 01:45:22.666]  I'm confused.
[01:45:23.327 --> 01:45:25.829]  Well, first of all, I'm not an investment advisor.
[01:45:26.405 --> 01:45:27.145]  I'm an economist.
[01:45:27.185 --> 01:45:28.726]  I'm talking in real broad terms here.
[01:45:29.226 --> 01:45:42.411]  This is an environment where the investor wants to protect his wealth, his assets, and as a result, what you invest in, you want it to be safe and liquid.
[01:45:42.691 --> 01:45:44.651]  Those would be two prequalifications.
[01:45:44.711 --> 01:45:48.133]  But you're not going to tell people to get into gold because that's not what you do, but you did say, hey.
[01:45:48.153 --> 01:45:49.033]  Gold is a very fine...
[01:45:52.233 --> 01:45:52.553]  What else is?
[01:45:52.573 --> 01:45:52.733]  I agree.
[01:45:52.753 --> 01:45:53.094]  Very complex.
[01:45:53.114 --> 01:45:53.474]  Swiss bonds.
[01:45:53.494 --> 01:45:53.874]  Swiss bonds.
[01:46:22.269 --> 01:46:25.732]  You know, that would accomplish it, but I'm... One small word.
[01:46:25.772 --> 01:46:31.757]  Generally, I think interest rates are going to rise globally, so you want to stay short-term in terms of debt instruments.
[01:46:32.138 --> 01:46:32.558]  I agree.
[01:46:32.638 --> 01:46:33.539]  High quality.
[01:46:34.219 --> 01:46:37.022]  High quality, safety, liquidity.
[01:46:37.082 --> 01:46:38.963]  Those are the general guidelines you want to look at.
[01:46:39.204 --> 01:46:40.224]  Portability, mobility.
[01:46:40.745 --> 01:46:46.049]  Dave in Illinois, you're on the air with one of the global leading experts on forecasting, shadowstats.com.
[01:46:46.069 --> 01:46:46.830]  John Williams, go ahead.
[01:46:47.450 --> 01:46:48.271]  Yeah, thanks, Alex.
[01:46:48.371 --> 01:46:49.092]  My question is,
[01:46:50.364 --> 01:46:58.530]  Roosevelt had the New Deal that pulled us out of the 1929 Depression, which created jobs, and they had the CC camps.
[01:47:00.291 --> 01:47:04.713]  What do you see about after... You know, there's no doubt this is all going to collapse.
[01:47:04.814 --> 01:47:05.374]  It's coming.
[01:47:05.414 --> 01:47:12.558]  I've been seeing it being in the transportation business since 2004, and the fall, whenever it started falling.
[01:47:13.679 --> 01:47:16.361]  And do you... What do you...
[01:47:16.929 --> 01:47:21.150]  What are your feelings and thoughts about how we're going to get out of it once it does fall?
[01:47:21.830 --> 01:47:34.192]  Even if they make new money, you're still going to have to have some kind of employment for people to make this new money for them to spend it.
[01:47:35.072 --> 01:47:39.473]  Or are we going to live in a road warrior type atmosphere?
[01:47:39.553 --> 01:47:41.933]  This really concerns me.
[01:47:42.433 --> 01:47:46.674]  And how about all the trillions that, for instance, we owe China
[01:47:47.949 --> 01:47:51.672]  Are they going to take possession of our ground?
[01:47:52.052 --> 01:47:53.533]  They're already taking assets.
[01:47:53.573 --> 01:47:54.634]  That's what the foreigners are doing.
[01:47:54.694 --> 01:47:55.254]  Thank you, Dave.
[01:47:55.294 --> 01:47:56.455]  Incredible question.
[01:47:57.175 --> 01:47:57.676]  Mr. Williams?
[01:47:58.216 --> 01:48:05.981]  In terms of the trillions of dollars that are out there where the government owes the money, they're going to pay it off with worthless money.
[01:48:06.241 --> 01:48:08.723]  And so that's taken care of.
[01:48:09.163 --> 01:48:16.808]  In terms of how you get out of it or where you go, again, I can't tell you what the political environment is going to evolve into here.
[01:48:17.307 --> 01:48:32.636]  But if the system were left to its own devices and you didn't have government intervention and you didn't have all these destructive trade policies, the system would become self-righting.
[01:48:33.016 --> 01:48:34.437]  We didn't get into this overnight.
[01:48:34.477 --> 01:48:36.778]  We're not going to get out of it overnight.
[01:48:37.699 --> 01:48:41.781]  It could be a couple of decades until things started to return to a normal basis.
[01:48:41.921 --> 01:48:43.302]  We're up the creek without a paddle.
[01:48:43.862 --> 01:48:44.202]  I'm sorry?
[01:48:44.362 --> 01:48:45.503]  We're up the creek without a paddle.
[01:48:46.483 --> 01:48:50.245]  We are, but there have been so many excesses in the system.
[01:48:50.345 --> 01:48:53.566]  I mean, people talk in fear and terror of a recession.
[01:48:54.026 --> 01:48:56.307]  Recession's a normal part of the business cycle.
[01:48:56.347 --> 01:48:57.748]  It's like going to sleep at night.
[01:48:58.148 --> 01:48:59.688]  It cleanses your system.
[01:48:59.728 --> 01:49:03.430]  They've done everything they can to prevent it, and there's so much waste and trouble in the system.
[01:49:04.250 --> 01:49:08.132]  The plus in all this is that all the bad stuff should get flushed out of the system.
[01:49:08.472 --> 01:49:14.214]  Now, maybe the politics will go bad in the other way and counterbalance that, but
[01:49:15.106 --> 01:49:17.969]  The system by itself will tend to become self-righting.
[01:49:18.089 --> 01:49:26.517]  Well, Mr. Williams, that's my fear is that they know this is coming and they're going to gear up and bring us into tyranny and use the crisis to bring us into something even worse.
[01:49:28.098 --> 01:49:30.341]  Well, I sure hope you're wrong on that.
[01:49:31.402 --> 01:49:31.902]  Okay, sir.
[01:49:32.623 --> 01:49:38.368]  I can tell you that the financial circumstance will be severe enough that...
[01:49:39.614 --> 01:49:40.896]  Almost anything could happen there.
[01:49:41.236 --> 01:49:42.257]  Mr. Williams, hold on one moment.
[01:49:42.277 --> 01:49:49.206]  I'd like to talk to you during the break and say bye to you or maybe twist the arm for two more minutes on the other side and take two more calls.
[01:49:49.466 --> 01:49:49.967]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:50.007 --> 01:49:50.588]  We'll see what happens.
[01:49:53.706 --> 01:50:00.473]  There are many types of storable foods, but how about a superfood that contains every nutrient that the human body needs for survival?
[01:50:00.493 --> 01:50:12.525]  50% protein, 300 milligrams of potassium per ounce, and calcium and magnesium for your heart and bones, with many more nutrients found in this incredible food source that the government does not want you to have.
[01:50:12.805 --> 01:50:17.730]  This product is available in powder, seeds, and oil, and is shipped free to your door in the U.S.,
[01:50:18.110 --> 01:50:18.771]  We're good to go.

[01:50:33.803 --> 01:50:37.045]  Remember what the Word of God says in Ezekiel 719.

[01:50:54.216 --> 01:51:06.941]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in Internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:51:07.361 --> 01:51:14.104]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[01:51:14.444 --> 01:51:14.964]  We're good to go.
[01:51:15.004 --> 01:51:15.985]  We're good to go.
[01:51:33.553 --> 01:51:35.274]  We're in a no-holds-barred information war.
[01:51:35.294 --> 01:51:39.195]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[01:51:54.150 --> 01:51:57.093]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:51:57.253 --> 01:52:02.417]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:52:02.777 --> 01:52:08.082]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:52:08.502 --> 01:52:09.623]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:09.983 --> 01:52:18.831]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:52:21.133 --> 01:52:29.961]  All natural, earth-friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing, they're safe, and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.

[01:53:00.700 --> 01:53:01.261]  Blessings to you.
[01:53:01.281 --> 01:53:03.102]  I've been long-term unemployed thanks to the New World Order.
[01:53:27.339 --> 01:53:40.343]  And one, I'm planning on getting a victory garden going as the season progresses, as well as being on good terms with an organic farm just a little bit down the road where my dad plays out in the country.
[01:53:41.944 --> 01:53:49.466]  I was wondering if there's any particular industries, like would mining be a good industry to get into, given that...
[01:53:50.652 --> 01:53:55.053]  That the value of precious metals will be shooting up, for example, would that be a good place to go?
[01:53:55.273 --> 01:54:00.514]  Mining industry and stocks, the whole thing's up, but again, of everything, craters, you can't guarantee that.
[01:54:01.434 --> 01:54:06.615]  Medical, nursing, government, but then that's, I mean, well, let's talk to the experts, sir.
[01:54:08.435 --> 01:54:10.375]  Well, I don't know if I'm an expert there.
[01:54:11.436 --> 01:54:19.077]  I would look for... People will need to eat and farming is...
[01:54:20.477 --> 01:54:21.617]  It's a wonderful area.
[01:54:23.258 --> 01:54:28.580]  The problem with mining and such is, I mean, you're in Georgia?
[01:54:30.060 --> 01:54:35.442]  There's Dahlonega, which had a gold mine going back to the 19th century.
[01:54:35.942 --> 01:54:40.343]  Well, I mean, if gold prices get high enough that it's economic, that might be a good idea.
[01:54:40.363 --> 01:54:43.544]  I mean, it all depends on the circumstance.
[01:54:43.584 --> 01:54:46.145]  But, sir, they tend to hire people who've been in the industry.
[01:54:46.826 --> 01:54:49.689]  I mean, a lot of times there's a bunch of Dutch and Germans at these mines, right?
[01:54:49.709 --> 01:54:50.970]  You know, in Arizona or Texas.
[01:54:51.491 --> 01:54:52.251]  Listen, gotta jump.
[01:54:52.271 --> 01:54:52.872]  Thanks for the call.
[01:54:52.932 --> 01:54:54.474]  Terry in Seattle, Washington.
[01:54:54.754 --> 01:54:55.855]  You're on the air with our guest.
[01:54:56.476 --> 01:55:05.465]  Mr. Williams, it would seem that the imposition of the dollar and our economy is dovetailing perfectly with the establishment of the North American Union.
[01:55:06.065 --> 01:55:06.865]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:55:28.352 --> 01:55:32.453]  Well, I think this is the question.
[01:55:32.473 --> 01:55:35.154]  We already know it's $1.54 to the dollar right now.
[01:55:35.414 --> 01:55:37.095]  The pound's even more.
[01:55:37.495 --> 01:55:39.555]  It's $2.2.01 against the dollar.
[01:55:40.036 --> 01:55:40.876]  Here's the big question.
[01:55:40.936 --> 01:55:45.037]  How fast do you project the dollar's going to devalue down to toilet paper?
[01:55:46.377 --> 01:55:52.799]  Well, that's my two years plus forecast.
[01:55:52.899 --> 01:55:54.780]  It's going to take a little time until the
[01:55:56.547 --> 01:55:58.750]  All the pressures for the hyperinflation kick in.
[01:55:59.091 --> 01:56:01.354]  The Fed's doing a lot to move it along right now.
[01:56:02.115 --> 01:56:09.806]  It still could be some years down the road, but in terms of constructing an Amero
[01:56:10.658 --> 01:56:13.740]  With a dollar that's worthless, that becomes an interesting task.
[01:56:13.860 --> 01:56:14.700]  Well, that's what they want to do.
[01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:15.181]  They've said it.
[01:56:15.461 --> 01:56:17.022]  But here's the last question.
[01:56:17.402 --> 01:56:28.709]  Do you see an incremental slow slide at an angle, down at a 45-degree angle, or do you see it in steps down, or do you see it as just a plunge?
[01:56:29.549 --> 01:56:39.655]  Well, odds would favor things happening a lot faster than most people would think, and it can happen very quickly, so it would be more of a plunge.
[01:56:40.815 --> 01:56:41.656]  Would be my betting.
[01:56:41.756 --> 01:56:43.657]  So odds are two years out.
[01:56:44.117 --> 01:56:46.418]  But odds are two years out for total bedlam.
[01:56:46.658 --> 01:56:48.619]  But you're saying it could happen next week.
[01:56:50.100 --> 01:56:50.620]  It could.
[01:56:51.941 --> 01:56:55.002]  Again, I think it's a little further down the road.
[01:56:55.062 --> 01:56:58.704]  But when it hits, it should hit hard and fast.
[01:56:59.605 --> 01:57:00.145]  Oh, my gosh.
[01:57:00.365 --> 01:57:02.426]  So kind of a slow slide and suddenly a plunge.
[01:57:03.667 --> 01:57:04.807]  Yeah, something along those lines.
[01:57:04.827 --> 01:57:05.748]  That would be my guess.
[01:57:05.868 --> 01:57:06.048]  Again...
[01:57:07.679 --> 01:57:09.580]  Almost anything can happen here.
[01:57:09.981 --> 01:57:16.204]  Despite other countries having gone through similar things, no one's gone through exactly the type of thing we're going through.
[01:57:16.224 --> 01:57:20.287]  Here, we're very much in uncharted waters.
[01:57:20.467 --> 01:57:22.628]  And in the Great Depression, we were 80% agrarian.
[01:57:22.648 --> 01:57:23.949]  Now we're 90-plus percent city.
[01:57:24.329 --> 01:57:24.869]  Unbelievable.
[01:57:24.929 --> 01:57:26.010]  Shadowstats.com.
[01:57:26.050 --> 01:57:28.432]  John Williams, thank you for your analysis and time.
[01:57:29.212 --> 01:57:29.612]  Most welcome.
[01:57:30.133 --> 01:57:30.733]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:35.146 --> 01:57:37.068]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:57:49.857 --> 01:57:50.538]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.178 --> 01:57:52.259]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.940 --> 01:57:54.061]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.701 --> 01:57:55.522]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.282 --> 01:57:57.223]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.824 --> 01:58:01.727]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.027 --> 01:58:04.389]  And now, live from Austin, Texas...
[01:58:05.243 --> 01:58:06.084]  Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.304 --> 01:58:14.969]  You know, I love my listeners, whether you live in England or Germany or Texas or New York, Canada, Mexico, it doesn't matter.
[01:58:14.989 --> 01:58:19.232]  And we told you free prices would start increasing.
[01:58:19.252 --> 01:58:19.632]  They have.
[01:58:19.672 --> 01:58:20.993]  We told you this would happen with the dollar.
[01:58:21.073 --> 01:58:24.535]  Every major expert we have on, we just tell the truth.
[01:58:24.595 --> 01:58:26.056]  It isn't hard to figure this stuff out.
[01:58:26.156 --> 01:58:31.940]  Ted Anderson was talking to his brokers last night, and they were like, yeah, well, you know, when do you think the dollar will come back, Ted?
[01:58:31.980 --> 01:58:33.421]  And Ted said, it ain't ever coming back.
[01:58:35.074 --> 01:58:38.219]  It's about a 95% chance we're going into total world government.
[01:58:38.239 --> 01:58:40.523]  They're going to use this as a police state crackdown.
[01:58:41.445 --> 01:58:43.248]  We're not giving you negative news.
[01:58:43.288 --> 01:58:44.469]  We're just telling you the truth.
[01:58:45.030 --> 01:58:46.453]  It isn't negative to tell you the truth.
[01:58:46.493 --> 01:58:48.336]  It's very positive what you're hearing here.
[01:58:49.844 --> 01:58:50.925]  We're good to go.
[01:58:51.025 --> 01:58:51.966]  We're good to go.
[01:59:11.114 --> 01:59:14.237]  But Ted has got the same price he had a week ago.
[01:59:14.337 --> 01:59:15.238]  It's going to be going up.
[01:59:15.298 --> 01:59:17.480]  If gold doesn't go down, and it isn't going down, it's going up.
[01:59:17.860 --> 01:59:18.961]  And he's about to run out of this.
[01:59:18.981 --> 01:59:24.466]  They're going to have brokers there all weekend, Saturday and Sunday, and late tonight, to take your orders.
[01:59:24.547 --> 01:59:26.228]  Ted, tell them about the offer.
[01:59:26.288 --> 01:59:27.709]  They just heard the economic outlook.
[01:59:28.150 --> 01:59:34.836]  I was just telling Ted the tiny amount of money he makes doing this, and how it supports the network, because there's literally about a 4% markup here just to take the orders.
[01:59:35.596 --> 01:59:37.118]  I guess about the same in the silver.
[01:59:38.013 --> 01:59:44.077]  And I said, we are capitalizing the network in a small way, and we're doing it completely morally.
[01:59:44.417 --> 01:59:46.138]  That's how I roll, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:59:46.438 --> 01:59:48.399]  You need to call and melt their phones down.
[01:59:48.419 --> 01:59:51.902]  I don't care if it's one quarter gold piece or 20 ounces of gold.
[01:59:52.402 --> 01:59:55.203]  Folks, we told you to buy it when it was 260-something.
[01:59:55.244 --> 01:59:55.544]  Now it's 980.
[01:59:56.084 --> 01:59:57.745]  And, folks, you just heard it.
[01:59:58.005 --> 02:00:00.327]  The globalists are shutting this country down.
[02:00:00.747 --> 02:00:02.288]  We can't probably save the country.
[02:00:02.928 --> 02:00:04.989]  In the short term, but we can maybe help ourselves.
[02:00:05.030 --> 02:00:05.290]  Ted?
[02:00:05.790 --> 02:00:06.931]  No, you're right about that, Alex.
[02:00:06.951 --> 02:00:11.214]  The dollar is not going to come back, and you better be getting into gold and silver at this time.
[02:00:11.254 --> 02:00:12.234]  That's all I can say.
[02:00:12.294 --> 02:00:15.436]  Everything else that's out there, the bond market's going to take it on the chin.
[02:00:15.756 --> 02:00:20.199]  Right now, the bonds are actually at a premium right now because the Fed artificially lowered the interest rates.
[02:00:20.700 --> 02:00:22.641]  What an opportunity to get out of that market.
[02:00:22.961 --> 02:00:24.542]  The stock market is going to get hit, too.
[02:00:24.922 --> 02:00:26.243]  You've added the economist on.
[02:00:26.283 --> 02:00:27.924]  He's already told everybody what that's about.
[02:00:27.944 --> 02:00:28.865]  I'll talk about the gold.
[02:00:29.485 --> 02:00:32.268]  Presently, right now, we have the British Sovereign Gold coin.
[02:00:32.328 --> 02:00:33.549]  It is trading at 268.
[02:00:35.051 --> 02:00:38.194]  We have the Frank coin, which is trading at 214.
[02:00:38.234 --> 02:00:42.919]  And, obviously, a really good buy, too, is the silver right now.
[02:00:42.959 --> 02:00:46.723]  And for rolls of 20, you can get into the Walking Liberty halves for 210.
[02:00:46.803 --> 02:00:49.026]  And, Alex, at this time, they're just as...
[02:00:51.768 --> 02:00:59.872]  The market is here, and it's showing that this is going to continue, and supplies are drying up.
[02:01:00.212 --> 02:01:01.472]  The supplies are finite.
[02:01:01.892 --> 02:01:06.334]  Silver and gold coins that we've been talking about all these years are from the turn of the century.
[02:01:06.374 --> 02:01:08.015]  Folks, you're not getting in at the top.
[02:01:08.495 --> 02:01:09.916]  All the evidence shows.
[02:01:10.876 --> 02:01:14.157]  All the evidence points towards getting in on the bottom right now.
[02:01:14.197 --> 02:01:15.498]  This is the bottom floor.
[02:01:15.858 --> 02:01:17.418]  This is not the middle floor.
[02:01:17.959 --> 02:01:21.460]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're looking at $2,000, $3,000 gold and silver.
[02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:24.961]  Heaven knows, regardless, it can't be devalued.
[02:01:25.161 --> 02:01:27.882]  It's not like the toilet paper Federal Reserve currencies.
[02:01:27.902 --> 02:01:29.183]  We gave the bankers control.
[02:01:29.383 --> 02:01:30.343]  They have raped us.
[02:01:30.843 --> 02:01:31.904]  They are sinking the ship.
[02:01:31.944 --> 02:01:33.665]  The least you can do is get in the lifeboats.
[02:01:34.026 --> 02:01:34.706]  We're getting in them.
[02:01:35.006 --> 02:01:36.347]  Me and Ted climbed in years ago.
[02:01:36.387 --> 02:01:38.669]  We're way off from the ship going towards land.
[02:01:38.889 --> 02:01:41.811]  We're radioing you saying, get on the lifeboat, dummy.
[02:01:42.092 --> 02:01:42.912]  Ted, give them the number.
[02:01:43.172 --> 02:01:43.613]  Yeah, it's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:01:43.633 --> 02:01:44.013]  Again, that's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:01:50.338 --> 02:01:50.718]  2-2-3-7.
[02:01:50.819 --> 02:01:51.499]  Do it now.
[02:01:51.559 --> 02:01:52.821]  Don't put it off any longer.
[02:01:52.921 --> 02:01:53.582]  Get it done.
[02:01:53.942 --> 02:01:55.144]  You've been thinking about doing it?
[02:01:55.384 --> 02:01:55.684]  Do it.
[02:01:55.985 --> 02:02:01.892]  And I'm going to tell you, if you haven't taken firearms training, you don't have shotguns and handguns and semi-autos, you need them right now.
[02:02:01.972 --> 02:02:02.633]  You need food.
[02:02:02.673 --> 02:02:03.714]  You need water filters.
[02:02:04.134 --> 02:02:04.475]  Because...
[02:02:05.095 --> 02:02:09.097]  The money is more than 50% on total road warrior bedlam.
[02:02:09.497 --> 02:02:15.700]  Let's pray none of that happens and then you just know how to use a gun and you've got some storable food that's gone up in value and you can eat it to save money.
[02:02:16.120 --> 02:02:17.761]  And you can sell gold and make a profit.
[02:02:17.781 --> 02:02:18.061]  800-686-2237.
[02:02:18.121 --> 02:02:19.141]  Give them a call.
[02:02:19.161 --> 02:02:20.742]  They'll be there all weekend and tonight.
[02:02:20.802 --> 02:02:21.682]  Give them a call now.
[02:02:21.702 --> 02:02:21.742]  800-686-2237.
[02:02:21.762 --> 02:02:22.143]  Here's the number.
[02:02:22.163 --> 02:02:22.203]  800-686-2237.
[02:02:31.247 --> 02:02:33.510]  2237.
[02:02:31.588 --> 02:02:33.510]  You don't need a new fancy motorcycle.
[02:02:33.530 --> 02:02:34.571]  You need gold and silver.
[02:02:34.591 --> 02:02:34.911]  800-686-2237.
[02:02:35.011 --> 02:02:37.454]  Thanks, Ted.
[02:02:37.474 --> 02:02:39.536]  Thanks a lot for having me up again, Alex.
[02:02:39.556 --> 02:02:40.978]  We'll be right back with a big guest.
[02:02:40.998 --> 02:02:42.039]  Your calls, tons of news.
[02:02:42.059 --> 02:02:42.499]  Stay with me.
[02:02:42.559 --> 02:02:43.000]  It's Friday.

[02:03:25.244 --> 02:03:25.904]  We're good to go.
[02:03:45.763 --> 02:03:47.445]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[02:03:47.765 --> 02:03:51.229]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:03:51.389 --> 02:03:53.251]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:03:53.271 --> 02:03:56.595]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:03:56.915 --> 02:04:02.421]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[02:04:02.702 --> 02:04:06.646]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[02:04:06.966 --> 02:04:11.889]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[02:04:12.189 --> 02:04:14.951]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[02:04:36.246 --> 02:04:37.888]  Join PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:04:38.329 --> 02:04:40.071]  Burn the info bombs to disk.

[02:04:44.277 --> 02:04:45.018]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:04:46.767 --> 02:04:47.928]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, MD.
[02:04:47.948 --> 02:04:50.329]  I'm the Nutri-Medical Report here on Jetsons.
[02:04:50.469 --> 02:04:53.450]  Allicin's natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[02:04:53.510 --> 02:04:54.190]  is a real thing.
[02:04:54.270 --> 02:05:01.154]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer for a fresh, never-before-available garlic.
[02:05:01.274 --> 02:05:06.536]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites,
[02:05:07.217 --> 02:05:12.161]  And it kills flesh and bacteria, MRSA, Acinetobacter infections that ravage our everyday health.
[02:05:12.261 --> 02:05:12.901]  Take it daily.
[02:05:12.961 --> 02:05:20.968]  It removes these stealth pathogens, clearing our bodies of disease activators that cause chronic health issues and means a much higher level of wellness for you and your family.
[02:05:21.128 --> 02:05:33.339]  Order today for fighting disease, turning on your immune system, activating infection-fighting properties against sinus, lung, bowel, skin, Lyme disease, nail fungus, colds, flu, ringworm, gum disease, diarrhea, athlete's foot, and cholesterol.
[02:05:33.599 --> 02:05:36.602]  I would also like to thank C-SPAN for being here and covering this event.
[02:06:02.544 --> 02:06:14.734]  C-SPAN has been really the only outlet on national television that hasn't just shown small portions or had speakers exposing 9-11 as an inside job on for just a few minutes.
[02:06:14.774 --> 02:06:20.158]  They have covered quite a few presentations by David Ray Griffin and others, the 9-11 truth convergence.
[02:06:20.558 --> 02:06:22.199]  And so, again, they really need to be commended.
[02:06:22.259 --> 02:06:22.940]  Thank you, C-SPAN.
[02:06:52.390 --> 02:06:58.552]  I'm just going to speak for a few minutes, then we're going to introduce our panel and give them all a five-minute opening statement.
[02:06:58.572 --> 02:07:11.796]  Then we're going to open it up to a general discussion about 9-11 and the unanswered questions and the clear evidence of black op, black world involvement in the tragic attacks in New York and Washington, D.C.
[02:07:11.896 --> 02:07:15.617]  And then later, I believe we'll have time for about 15, 20 minutes of questions.
[02:07:19.198 --> 02:07:20.118]  Long before 9-11 took place,
[02:07:23.556 --> 02:07:31.962]  I was fully aware of the historical fact that governments, Western governments, Eastern governments, the U.S.
[02:07:32.002 --> 02:07:48.073]  government, elements of it, normally small criminal elements, have staged terror attacks or have manufactured different pretexts to invade countries, attack nations, or enslave their own domestic populations with police state measures.
[02:07:48.954 --> 02:07:56.596]  And so, opening this up today, I wanted to talk a little bit about the history of state-sponsored false flag terrorism.
[02:07:58.036 --> 02:08:15.940]  Even the CIA's own website, CIA.gov, in their history department, admits in 14 books, scholarly books have been published, including one by Herman Roosevelt himself, where our own government admits that in 1953, they staged false flag terror attacks and riots, shootings,
[02:08:17.498 --> 02:08:23.280]  To blame it on the president, the elected president, Mosaday.
[02:08:25.441 --> 02:08:26.321]  That's part of the record.
[02:08:27.002 --> 02:08:30.403]  And then we have declassified documents like Operation Northwoods.
[02:08:31.147 --> 02:08:37.249]  From the early 1960s, it was green-lighted all the way up to Kennedy, and President Kennedy said no to Operation Northwoods.
[02:08:37.589 --> 02:08:43.451]  Operation Northwoods, in late 2000, was actually covered by ABC News and the Baltimore Sun.
[02:08:43.951 --> 02:08:47.872]  You can read the document itself, the National Security Archive, and the Library of Congress online.
[02:08:48.072 --> 02:08:49.832]  Just type Operation Northwoods into Google.
[02:08:50.213 --> 02:08:54.154]  I say that for the TV viewers out there because this is really a foundational document.
[02:08:54.894 --> 02:08:57.715]  In it, the Pentagon and...
[02:08:59.204 --> 02:09:00.284]  General L.L.
[02:09:00.304 --> 02:09:14.507]  Lemonster, the chairman who joins you as a staff, proposed, not as a war game, but as an operational plan they wanted to implement as a pretext to go to war with Cuba and then perhaps the Soviet Union, widening it, a cocktail, a cornucopia of false flag events.
[02:09:14.847 --> 02:09:21.728]  Events that would kill and wound individuals, American citizens, and then other events where they would claim Americans had died or none had died.
[02:09:22.008 --> 02:09:27.169]  And one of the five different terror attacks they discussed that they could carry out to blame on a foreign government
[02:09:27.913 --> 02:09:42.949]  Is the hijacking of a jet by remote control and crashing it and having a list of dead Americans, preferably students, to create a catalyzing event to get the public angry and behind a war effort?
[02:09:42.969 --> 02:09:46.092]  You can go read this in Operation Northwater.
[02:09:46.152 --> 02:09:46.753]  All right, folks.
[02:09:47.381 --> 02:09:58.907]  Yeah, I saw that somebody had posted 11 parts of the entire almost two-hour piece that aired on C-SPAN of our 9-11 Neocon Agenda Symposium up on YouTube, so folks can find that and hopefully get that out to people.
[02:09:58.947 --> 02:09:59.867]  That's just my introduction.
[02:10:00.447 --> 02:10:05.070]  A lot of powerful info from that conference now up there on YouTube.
[02:10:05.090 --> 02:10:07.131]  Kind of a blast from the past.
[02:10:09.312 --> 02:10:14.754]  Our guest has written just a whole bunch of New York Times bestselling books.
[02:10:14.974 --> 02:10:15.835]  Very, very respected.
[02:10:17.366 --> 02:10:20.548]  And then I got up this morning.
[02:10:21.248 --> 02:10:23.789]  I knew he'd been contacting us about coming on the show, and I meant to get him on.
[02:10:23.809 --> 02:10:24.970]  I just hadn't read the book yet.
[02:10:25.410 --> 02:10:27.491]  Then I got up and saw op-ed news today.
[02:10:27.511 --> 02:10:32.854]  9-11 truth issues explode on the CBS National Radio yesterday.
[02:10:34.873 --> 02:10:39.174]  And he went on national radio and basically tore them up big time.
[02:10:39.675 --> 02:10:43.196]  So we are very honored to have Steve Alton on.
[02:10:43.216 --> 02:10:45.737]  The new book is The Shell Game.
[02:10:46.297 --> 02:10:47.997]  And Mr. Alton, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:10:49.138 --> 02:10:50.278]  Alex, the pleasure's all mine.
[02:10:51.502 --> 02:10:54.523]  You've got such a big bio and such a lengthy, successful career.
[02:10:54.543 --> 02:11:08.069]  I don't know where to start, but just in a nutshell, tell us about yourself, who you are, how you woke up to 9-11 being an inside job, and why you wrote The Shell Game, The End of Oil, The Next 9-11, The End of Civilization, and how your political views have changed.
[02:11:09.570 --> 02:11:12.291]  Alex, The Shell Game is my eighth novel.
[02:11:12.391 --> 02:11:16.053]  My career started back in 1996 with Meg, a novel of deep terror.
[02:11:16.073 --> 02:11:18.274]  It was quite a bit different, about a 70-foot...
[02:11:19.238 --> 02:11:19.718]  I think so.
[02:11:42.697 --> 02:11:49.303]  But it started off investigating whether peak oil existed or not and the implications of it.
[02:11:49.323 --> 02:11:59.352]  And suddenly I was thrust into the events of 9-11 and began reading these through the lies of the Bush administration, which I had swallowed too.
[02:11:59.552 --> 02:12:01.974]  And it just got me very angry.
[02:12:02.455 --> 02:12:09.121]  And I realized that I had to change the tone of this book, that I had to tell the truth even though it was going to put me out there and risk my career and
[02:12:09.973 --> 02:12:14.194]  And, you know, this is life and death stuff, and there's more important things in my career.
[02:12:14.234 --> 02:12:33.760]  And so I decided to write the book and tell it as a fictional thriller, fictional because it takes place a few years from now, a thriller because it tells a story, but it really is a cautionary tale that extrapolates the real events from 9-11 and tells us the road that we're on and where we're going.
[02:12:35.961 --> 02:12:36.601]  Absolutely.
[02:12:37.867 --> 02:12:44.393]  You know, I loved reading the transcript of you on national radio on CBS syndicated program talking about this.
[02:12:45.014 --> 02:12:48.016]  And it shocked the host because he wasn't expecting you to get into all this.
[02:12:48.037 --> 02:12:49.558]  You went through a lot of the key areas.
[02:12:50.098 --> 02:12:51.580]  But tell us, because this is interesting.
[02:12:51.880 --> 02:12:55.824]  You know, we have the best actress this year, Academy Award winner, coming out of 9-11 Truth.
[02:12:56.224 --> 02:13:00.988]  We have the Italian former president, former head of intelligence, all these former German defense ministers.
[02:13:01.008 --> 02:13:01.748]  Now it's two of them.
[02:13:02.329 --> 02:13:03.650]  You know, all these other people.
[02:13:03.710 --> 02:13:05.631]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, father of Reaganomics.
[02:13:05.651 --> 02:13:07.072]  I mean, hundreds and hundreds of prominent people.
[02:13:07.433 --> 02:13:11.716]  It's an avalanche, and the establishment's now calling for the arrest of 9-11 truthers.
[02:13:11.736 --> 02:13:14.358]  That's a talking point all over MSNBC and Fox.
[02:13:15.659 --> 02:13:17.420]  And CNN, by the way, with Glenn Beck.
[02:13:17.961 --> 02:13:20.803]  So they're really in damage control emergency mode right now.
[02:13:20.823 --> 02:13:20.923]  But...
[02:13:22.329 --> 02:13:26.330]  The process, I mean, how you first bought into the lie and then how you woke up from that lie.
[02:13:28.170 --> 02:13:35.252]  Well, like a lot of Americans, I mean, you know, you sort of rally behind the president as a natural reaction.
[02:13:35.272 --> 02:13:47.895]  But once I started doing research for the book and reading the great materials that's out there, including David Ray Griffin and including Michael C. Rupert's book, Crossing the Rubicon, and
[02:13:48.624 --> 02:13:58.070]  And, you know, DVDs, loose change guys, and started looking at all that material, I realized that this is absolutely criminal.
[02:13:58.770 --> 02:14:04.774]  And what really scared me was the fact that, you know, if you read the Project for a New American Century, these guys aren't done.
[02:14:04.794 --> 02:14:14.700]  I mean, Rumsfeld's not sitting on the beach somewhere drinking a cocktail, and the rest of these guys aren't going away until they finish what they started out to finish.
[02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:15.561]  In fact...
[02:14:16.636 --> 02:14:30.081]  You know, even though the book was completed about 10 months ago, the candidates that I named in the election that takes place in 2012 and the president, I seem to have hit it right on that, too.
[02:14:30.501 --> 02:14:33.342]  But it's the recent things that are in the news that scares me.
[02:14:34.882 --> 02:14:41.985]  The fact that Homeland Security Chief Michael Chertoff comes out and says that his biggest fear is a nuclear suitcase bomb going off in a city.
[02:14:42.501 --> 02:14:51.684]  A week later, Bush comes out and makes a statement in defense of waterboarding that the next 9-11 will make the last one pale in comparison.
[02:14:52.304 --> 02:14:56.485]  For me, I'm shaking when I hear this stuff because it's almost like they're reading the book.
[02:14:59.466 --> 02:15:05.428]  Well, the White House has admitted that they have...
[02:15:06.172 --> 02:15:28.842]  Yeah, but there is also two presidential directives out there that, you know, God forbid another false flag event were to take place before the November election, that Bush and Cheney would remain in power, that they can stop the election, and they could declare martial law.
[02:15:31.403 --> 02:15:34.565]  Talk about this radio interview you did a few days ago, and...
[02:15:36.027 --> 02:15:38.949]  The response you got and what the Neocon Talk Show host thought.
[02:15:40.270 --> 02:15:46.976]  Well, it was a big venue, the Jim Bohannon Show on CBS Radio.
[02:15:47.616 --> 02:15:53.421]  And as I was sitting in the green room listening to his prior guest, the prior guest was an executive from Shell Oil.
[02:15:54.522 --> 02:16:01.387]  And I was listening to his thing and I almost thought, well, this sounds like a setup that I'm being led to slaughter.
[02:16:02.849 --> 02:16:14.839]  But once we started talking, he took some phone calls and a fan of mine who had read the show game called in and specifically asked about 9-11 and the growing threat of another 9-11.
[02:16:15.480 --> 02:16:16.961]  And bam, we were off and going.
[02:16:17.021 --> 02:16:21.625]  And, you know, he's a radical right-winger.
[02:16:21.825 --> 02:16:22.406]  I mean, he's...
[02:16:24.949 --> 02:16:32.457]  You know, he started off the conversation talking about that the problem with Iraq is that Americans have it too soft and we need to institute a draft and then double the size of the military.
[02:16:32.497 --> 02:16:35.520]  And my response was, what the hell for?
[02:16:35.540 --> 02:16:40.665]  I mean, who are we fighting and who are we fighting for so that corporations make more money?
[02:16:42.067 --> 02:16:45.070]  But once we got into the 9-11 truth discussions and
[02:16:45.717 --> 02:17:07.778]  You know, I had to overcome the objection that, you know, he feels that all 9-11 truthers are conspiracy theorists and crazy wackos, and I let him know that, first of all, that's not the case, that the 9-11 truthers are the real patriots, and I include yourself in that, of the 21st century, and that the people who believe that it's all conspiracy theorists
[02:17:08.365 --> 02:17:10.846]  All have one thing in common, and that is they never looked at the facts.
[02:17:11.106 --> 02:17:13.886]  They just made an assumption that these people were crazy.
[02:17:13.906 --> 02:17:25.729]  And if you look at the facts like I did as a novelist, look at the facts as I did from a best-selling author, then there's only one conclusion you can come to, and that was, of course, it was an inside job.
[02:17:25.929 --> 02:17:27.149]  Well, who has the motive?
[02:17:27.989 --> 02:17:29.349]  Who stands to gain?
[02:17:29.409 --> 02:17:30.750]  Who could carry it out?
[02:17:31.470 --> 02:17:36.851]  All this and a lot more with Steve Olten, the new book, The Shell Gang.
[02:17:37.654 --> 02:17:40.255]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[02:17:40.755 --> 02:17:44.416]  We'll also open the phones up later to talk about all the new 9-11 truth developments.
[02:17:44.916 --> 02:17:45.536]  It's Friday.
[02:17:45.937 --> 02:17:47.337]  It is a big idea.
[02:17:47.357 --> 02:17:49.458]  A new world order.
[02:17:50.178 --> 02:17:54.659]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:17:55.059 --> 02:17:56.820]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[02:17:57.900 --> 02:18:00.121]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:18:00.681 --> 02:18:03.082]  For thousands of years, their dark border grew.
[02:18:03.860 --> 02:18:11.288]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:18:14.211 --> 02:18:19.157]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:18:19.977 --> 02:18:25.241]  Most people have no idea.
[02:18:25.261 --> 02:18:28.023]  They're not after money.
[02:18:28.043 --> 02:18:29.104]  They have all the money they need.
[02:18:29.304 --> 02:18:30.064]  They're after power.
[02:18:30.284 --> 02:18:31.325]  That's what they're after.

[02:22:14.944 --> 02:22:20.906]  Steve Olson is our guest, another prominent person going public for 9-11 proof, the new book, The Shell Game.
[02:22:23.927 --> 02:22:25.248]  Now, Steve, I want to be clear on this.
[02:22:25.448 --> 02:22:29.109]  How would you describe yourself politically just a few years ago before you woke up?
[02:22:30.769 --> 02:22:32.050]  I'm a registered Democrat.
[02:22:32.090 --> 02:22:38.092]  I'm not a liberal by any means, more conservative in nature, open-minded, listening to ideas, but...
[02:22:39.478 --> 02:22:40.878]  Yeah, I mean, I was asleep too.
[02:22:40.898 --> 02:22:48.240]  I mean, I was taken by surprise by the 9-11 information I found, but at the same time knew that it was the truth.
[02:22:48.940 --> 02:23:00.322]  And I think that the beauty of the shell game over a lot of the other terrific materials that have come out of that 9-11 truth is that it flies under the radar because it's a fictional novel written by a best-selling author.
[02:23:00.362 --> 02:23:07.983]  And so I get a lot of email every day from Republicans who have read the book, weren't expecting to read what they read,
[02:23:08.504 --> 02:23:10.365]  And now have changed their minds about things.
[02:23:14.086 --> 02:23:18.208]  But how shocked was this neocon Jim Bohannon?
[02:23:18.228 --> 02:23:20.769]  He kind of poses as a liberal, but he's a warmonger.
[02:23:20.789 --> 02:23:24.190]  I mean, how shocked was he when you were on the show arguing with him?
[02:23:25.511 --> 02:23:34.134]  It caught him off guard because he wasn't expecting the conversation to go there, and he wasn't expecting the things to come out in the interview that came out that sort of
[02:23:34.949 --> 02:23:37.130]  Took him aback because he couldn't answer them.
[02:23:37.511 --> 02:23:42.854]  I mean, you know, we got on to the war games and I told him about, you know, these false flag events.
[02:23:43.334 --> 02:23:49.178]  One of the key clues about it is that there always seems to be a war game that simulates exactly what the event is.
[02:23:49.278 --> 02:23:58.643]  And then on 9-11, we had these war games going on with NORAD and Dick Cheney in charge of things and the false blips inserted on radar screens of the FAA.
[02:23:58.663 --> 02:24:04.147]  And his initial response was, you know, so says you.
[02:24:05.413 --> 02:24:07.654]  I mean, so you're the only one who knows about this information.
[02:24:07.694 --> 02:24:10.236]  I said, no, this is not my information.
[02:24:10.256 --> 02:24:16.700]  I said, there's tens of thousands of people out there that know this information, and they cannot get any mainstream attention.
[02:24:16.760 --> 02:24:21.303]  And his response was, well, why don't they run out and have a congressional hearing about this?
[02:24:21.403 --> 02:24:30.029]  I said, listen, you've got a situation where the Fox is guarding the hen house, and the Fox has no interest in having an investigation about itself.
[02:24:30.829 --> 02:24:31.770]  And that's the problem.
[02:24:31.810 --> 02:24:33.651]  We also have mainstream media out there
[02:24:34.198 --> 02:24:36.078]  That are in the business of war.
[02:24:36.879 --> 02:24:41.139]  And business is good right now, and they don't want to talk about this stuff.
[02:24:41.159 --> 02:24:43.920]  They don't want to make any less money than they're making.
[02:24:44.940 --> 02:24:52.301]  And then we came up to the World Trade Centers and World Trade Center 7, and he did not know about World Trade Center 7 going down.
[02:24:52.341 --> 02:25:01.123]  And we discussed that a little bit to the point where I finally said to him, you know, Jim, how does a 47-story building just fall on its own at free-fall speed?
[02:25:01.917 --> 02:25:02.757]  How did that happen?
[02:25:02.817 --> 02:25:04.158]  He said, well, I don't know.
[02:25:04.238 --> 02:25:05.218]  And he said, exactly.
[02:25:05.238 --> 02:25:10.380]  You know, my... Well, I mean, when Willie Nelson... When Willie Nelson... Okay.
[02:25:10.960 --> 02:25:15.021]  It's just to pose the question and say, why don't we... Why aren't we asking these questions?
[02:25:15.061 --> 02:25:16.462]  Why aren't we seeking answers to it?
[02:25:17.102 --> 02:25:18.642]  Is everything a conspiracy?
[02:25:18.662 --> 02:25:20.603]  You know, maybe it's the truth.
[02:25:20.783 --> 02:25:21.984]  Maybe it needs to be looked into.
[02:25:22.084 --> 02:25:23.344]  Steve... He would shock...
[02:25:25.074 --> 02:25:36.561]  Steve, when Willie Nelson came on the show, and he said Tower 1 and 2 got hit by planes and fell, but then Tower 7 wasn't hit and fell, and then the media tried to spin it that he said the towers weren't hit by planes.
[02:25:36.602 --> 02:25:42.525]  You know, again, they know that Building 7 was imploded or was very suspicious.
[02:25:42.565 --> 02:25:46.348]  I mean, what about BBC reporting Building 7 had fallen before it fell?
[02:25:47.589 --> 02:25:48.949]  So they know what's going on.
[02:25:49.030 --> 02:25:51.131]  I don't believe that Jim Bohannon's that stupid.
[02:25:52.563 --> 02:25:56.946]  Well, I honestly believe that Jim Bohannon has never looked at the information.
[02:25:56.966 --> 02:26:12.715]  I believe that Keith Oberman has never looked at the information, or Bill Maher, or any of these people that would really speak out for this if it wasn't toxic to them, and they simply wipe it away as being 9-11 conspiracy theories.
[02:26:13.695 --> 02:26:15.636]  And that's one of the beauties of the show game.
[02:26:15.937 --> 02:26:19.419]  See, it's a thriller, and it's a thriller written by an established author.
[02:26:19.839 --> 02:26:21.760]  And so you catch people off guard.
[02:26:22.324 --> 02:26:33.172]  And I know that I caught Jim Bohannon off guard, and if your audience can help me, and I get on the Bill O'Reilly Show, I'm going to nail him to the wall, because he's not going to know what's coming on this either.
[02:26:33.192 --> 02:26:36.134]  Well, I hear what you're saying.
[02:26:36.154 --> 02:26:48.262]  What do you think the establishment's going to do as more and more prominent authors and movie stars and scientists and former presidents start coming out saying it's an inside job and then dropping the evidence down on the table?
[02:26:50.490 --> 02:27:03.082]  I think, you know, and I've said this to the 9-11 truth movement, I think that you have a concrete dam of lies, and you have to just keep hitting it with a sledgehammer until you start getting cracks.
[02:27:03.522 --> 02:27:13.392]  You know, David Ray Griffin hits it, you hit it, you know, the Loose Change guys hit it, the new Reflecting Pool guys hit it, and the Shogun hits it.
[02:27:13.732 --> 02:27:15.594]  At some point, you're going to get a crack,
[02:27:16.189 --> 02:27:23.330]  And somebody's going to take a chance in a major media that sees that the dam's cracking and it's going to break, and they're going to want to be the first to break the story.
[02:27:23.350 --> 02:27:23.790]  Absolutely.
[02:27:23.910 --> 02:27:26.531]  I want to hear from listeners how they think this is going to unfold.
[02:27:26.571 --> 02:27:35.052]  Will 9-11 truth just fade off in the sunset, or, as evidence shows, just keep growing, and will it ever result in people getting in trouble for it?
[02:27:36.073 --> 02:27:37.033]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.453 --> 02:27:39.053]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.073 --> 02:27:42.694]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.703 --> 02:27:46.143]  We're good to go.
[02:28:15.683 --> 02:28:16.143]  We're good to go.
[02:28:45.309 --> 02:28:46.750]  America needs Ron Paul.
[02:28:46.991 --> 02:28:48.052]  He needs your support.
[02:28:48.272 --> 02:28:49.273]  The time is now.
[02:28:49.653 --> 02:28:53.536]  As long as he has your support, he will continue to fight until the very end.
[02:28:53.876 --> 02:28:57.960]  We know that many people would like to show their support, but want to do it on a larger scale.
[02:28:58.300 --> 02:29:04.225]  RonPaulFlags.com produces the most beautiful flags dedicated to electing the only man fit to be president.

[02:29:22.254 --> 02:29:23.094]  And meet up groups.
[02:29:23.474 --> 02:29:24.575]  Flags start at 4307.

[02:29:38.419 --> 02:29:42.660]  Stand up for the only man worthy of restoring our country to how our forefathers envisioned.
[02:29:42.960 --> 02:29:44.601]  Fly a Ron Paul flag today.

[02:31:02.369 --> 02:31:27.060]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen, waging war on corruption, crashing through the lies and disinformation, Monday through Friday.
[02:31:30.422 --> 02:31:54.884]  And yes, ladies and gentlemen, I will be back live this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., with the Sunday edition, now syndicated on more than 25 stations, up and running for a year, simulcasting on global shortwave, the Internet, and satellite, out of the studios of NewsRadio 5, 90 KLBJ, and carried on stations like KCAA out of San Diego, California, KCXL out of Kansas City, and many others.
[02:31:54.944 --> 02:31:55.645]  We salute them.
[02:31:58.227 --> 02:31:59.809]  50,000 water out of Norfolk, Virginia.
[02:31:59.829 --> 02:32:02.732]  Room the phones up.
[02:32:02.772 --> 02:32:03.834]  I know it's going to be all over the map.
[02:32:03.874 --> 02:32:04.454]  That's fine.
[02:32:04.975 --> 02:32:08.019]  The author of The Shell Game, Steve Alton, rides shotgun with us.
[02:32:08.419 --> 02:32:12.304]  I just started trying to read this just in the last few days, and suddenly I noticed it broke in the news.
[02:32:12.344 --> 02:32:13.405]  Why haven't I gotten him on?
[02:32:14.046 --> 02:32:15.668]  There are just so many great people out there.
[02:32:16.602 --> 02:32:19.104]  And we'll talk a little bit about how the book reads and why folks should get it.
[02:32:19.545 --> 02:32:21.567]  Also, I haven't really plugged this today, and I need to.
[02:32:21.667 --> 02:32:22.748]  I've made 18 films.
[02:32:22.808 --> 02:32:38.662]  The latest is Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, The History of the New World Order, Their Master Plan, How They've Created an Amero, The Euro, How They're Merging the North American Union Currently with It, What Their Master Plan Is, How Their Eugenicist, How Hitler Learned Everything He Knew from Them, and Lord Milner.
[02:32:39.502 --> 02:32:40.643]  Two hours, 20 minutes.
[02:32:40.723 --> 02:32:43.626]  You want to have a master's degree in the New World Order, you'll have it with this one film.
[02:32:44.341 --> 02:32:51.272]  Then there's Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror, where we just look at all the admissions of terror our government and other governments have staged.
[02:32:51.893 --> 02:32:56.480]  That this is as common as sliced bread and fire hydrants.
[02:32:56.661 --> 02:32:57.963]  I mean, this is just everywhere.
[02:33:00.390 --> 02:33:05.431]  Again, InfoWars.com to order DVDs of all the films or other books and videos I carry.

[02:33:44.130 --> 02:33:45.231]  We just got bigger CDN...
[02:33:48.408 --> 02:33:54.053]  Servers, it streams super high fast, five different formats, downloads, we're just making it better and better.
[02:33:54.333 --> 02:33:55.974]  I just got even bigger CDNs.
[02:33:56.235 --> 02:34:00.458]  We got two CDNs, seven servers to run this network in the InfoWar.
[02:34:01.419 --> 02:34:03.100]  We're only using 50 terabytes right now.
[02:34:03.320 --> 02:34:03.901]  I just got 200.
[02:34:04.021 --> 02:34:05.682]  Yeah, we're planning big stuff.
[02:34:06.283 --> 02:34:07.664]  And the sites are all exploding.
[02:34:08.587 --> 02:34:11.288]  The enemy's trying to hit us and hit us hard in ways I won't even get into.
[02:34:11.328 --> 02:34:12.629]  We just laugh at it and work extra.
[02:34:12.729 --> 02:34:21.732]  Every time I'm tired and don't want to go back to work at 10 o'clock at night, somebody attacks me or does something, I just get up off the couch and just turbo through, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:34:22.392 --> 02:34:29.035]  All right, John, Stacy, Aaron, Chris, others, we're going to get to you here in just a moment.
[02:34:29.735 --> 02:34:34.937]  But just in a nutshell, tell us about how you put the 9-11 story into a novel.
[02:34:36.774 --> 02:34:39.135]  Well, Alex, the story takes place.
[02:34:39.195 --> 02:34:47.517]  It opens up in 2007 with two neoconservatives who work in intelligence meeting with a colonel who served in Iraq.
[02:34:47.557 --> 02:34:53.618]  And they're basically making their claim that Iran represents enriched uranium.
[02:34:53.658 --> 02:34:57.999]  In five years, they can take that enriched uranium, make suitcase bombs, give it to terrorists.
[02:34:58.839 --> 02:35:02.980]  Imagine the scenario of 20 cities simultaneously went off with nuclear suitcase bombs.
[02:35:03.570 --> 02:35:04.451]  How do you stop that?
[02:35:04.771 --> 02:35:06.493]  Rumsfeld broke the army.
[02:35:07.074 --> 02:35:09.136]  These guys have been on four, five, six deployments.
[02:35:09.456 --> 02:35:11.598]  There's no way we're prepared to go into Iran.
[02:35:12.099 --> 02:35:24.171]  And so their solution is to allow one suitcase bomb to go off in one city, a false flag event that they want this guy to help them set up, which will give them the green light
[02:35:26.263 --> 02:35:30.205]  To chemical bomb Iran and its military establishment, its nuclear establishment.
[02:35:30.225 --> 02:35:33.347]  And by the way, that's how they sold their own people.
[02:35:33.707 --> 02:35:40.031]  That's how they sold their own people on carrying out 9-11 is, if we don't do something like this, we're going to be weak and we are going to get hit.
[02:35:40.071 --> 02:35:42.413]  That's how they sell this military mindset.
[02:35:42.433 --> 02:35:42.753]  Go ahead.
[02:35:43.793 --> 02:35:44.834]  That's exactly right.
[02:35:44.874 --> 02:35:47.475]  I mean, you know, in their mind, they're justified what they do.
[02:35:47.816 --> 02:35:51.638]  And hell, what's a million people out of 300 million?
[02:35:51.718 --> 02:35:53.359]  I'm not saying you won't get your hair mushed.
[02:35:54.716 --> 02:35:55.016]  Right.
[02:35:55.476 --> 02:36:07.601]  You know, these are the sacrifices that the neoconservatives, the way they think, you know, of course, they're not going to be in the city when it gets blown up, but, you know, you've got to get rid of some of the sheep in order to make it easy for the wolves, and that's their thinking.
[02:36:07.621 --> 02:36:09.462]  Break a few eggs to make an omelet.
[02:36:10.583 --> 02:36:11.183]  Exactly.
[02:36:11.503 --> 02:36:23.648]  And so right away, right from the prologue, we know the story of the show game, that it's a false flag event, and what I did was extrapolate from everything that happened in 9-11 and put it into the storyline where you have
[02:36:24.150 --> 02:36:24.510]  Thank you.
[02:36:43.437 --> 02:36:46.318]  Everything that was going on in 2008 is going on in the storyline.
[02:36:46.338 --> 02:36:55.062]  And now that we're hurtling towards a depression, they're more likely than ever to pull this off, but not to help us economically, just to make sure we worship them while they control us.
[02:36:55.442 --> 02:37:00.764]  Anthony from We Are Change Ireland, who's confronted Bill Clinton and many others, is calling in.
[02:37:00.804 --> 02:37:04.425]  He's first up, then John, Stacey, Aaron, Chris, and others.
[02:37:04.525 --> 02:37:05.946]  Anthony, you're on the air from Ireland.
[02:37:07.506 --> 02:37:08.587]  Hi, Alex.
[02:37:08.767 --> 02:37:11.788]  I'm just ringing up to plug a new documentary we made.
[02:37:12.887 --> 02:37:13.727]  It's just gone live.
[02:37:14.648 --> 02:37:15.128]  Okay, good.
[02:37:15.168 --> 02:37:17.128]  Plug it.
[02:37:17.148 --> 02:37:18.389]  It's End of Nations.
[02:37:18.689 --> 02:37:21.710]  If you go to Google Videos, type in End of Nations.
[02:37:21.730 --> 02:37:22.971]  It's 122 minutes long.
[02:37:23.491 --> 02:37:24.471]  I've seen your promo.
[02:37:24.511 --> 02:37:26.072]  It's got some Endgame in it.
[02:37:26.092 --> 02:37:26.812]  It looks pretty good.
[02:37:27.772 --> 02:37:28.172]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:37:28.192 --> 02:37:30.673]  You put some Endgame footage in that, yeah.
[02:37:31.273 --> 02:37:34.234]  And for the research at the end, you have to view Endgame.
[02:37:34.254 --> 02:37:34.935]  It's important.
[02:37:34.955 --> 02:37:35.775]  Great, great.
[02:37:36.155 --> 02:37:38.776]  Again, End of Nations, and just Google that, and it'll come up.
[02:37:39.989 --> 02:37:40.469]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:37:40.590 --> 02:37:43.712]  And there's some stuff in it about the NAU also.
[02:37:43.852 --> 02:37:49.457]  Like, all the members of the European Parliament got sent a report making the case for the NAU.
[02:37:49.897 --> 02:37:52.059]  Over 700 copies were sent.
[02:37:52.199 --> 02:37:53.300]  Look, it looks powerful.
[02:37:53.340 --> 02:37:55.622]  I might even want to carry it if you get it on DVD.
[02:37:56.462 --> 02:37:58.884]  Let's try to set something up with Trey, okay?
[02:37:59.925 --> 02:38:00.546]  Yeah, great.
[02:38:01.086 --> 02:38:03.168]  Give out your Ireland We Are Change website.
[02:38:04.699 --> 02:38:09.183]  It's WACIreland.org and WiseUpJournal.com.
[02:38:09.644 --> 02:38:10.705]  All right, good job, my friend.
[02:38:10.965 --> 02:38:13.227]  What do you think of our guests going public for 9-11 Truth?
[02:38:15.549 --> 02:38:18.051]  Actually, I haven't been listening in the last few days.
[02:38:18.091 --> 02:38:21.514]  Normally I listen every day, but I've been way too busy up to 5 a.m.
[02:38:21.574 --> 02:38:22.735]  getting this documentary done.
[02:38:23.176 --> 02:38:23.816]  I know how it is.
[02:38:23.836 --> 02:38:24.677]  I appreciate your call.
[02:38:25.097 --> 02:38:30.442]  Okay, John in Ohio, you're on the air with our guest, author of The Shuttle Game, Steve Alton.
[02:38:30.622 --> 02:38:31.003]  Go ahead.
[02:38:31.952 --> 02:38:33.193]  Yeah, I just want to start out.
[02:38:33.233 --> 02:38:40.356]  This character, Jim Bohannon, I think, is a hardcore disinformation specialist going from way back for decades.
[02:38:40.396 --> 02:38:47.479]  He knows a lot more than he says, and he's justified every war, assassination, bombing, overthrow of a government around the world.
[02:38:47.719 --> 02:38:48.099]  He knows.
[02:38:48.559 --> 02:39:01.205]  But at any rate, I called originally to talk about some disagreements I have with you, but I just first wanted to say that we owe you a tremendous debt of gratitude, both you, Alex, and the guest, for...
[02:39:02.007 --> 02:39:16.370]  ...exposing their secret weapon of false flag terrorism that is justifying all of their police state measures and their warmongering across the globe, which I think you're doing a tremendous great service in exposing.
[02:39:16.390 --> 02:39:26.731]  I think the most taboo subject, of course, is the 9-11 truth, because it gets to the heart of the evil of these characters.
[02:39:26.791 --> 02:39:29.592]  They're not doing this out of the greater good...
[02:39:30.351 --> 02:39:34.712]  Through some kind of evil policy to accomplish a greater good.
[02:39:34.752 --> 02:39:37.293]  They are totally evil and evilly motivated.
[02:39:37.773 --> 02:39:55.019]  And I believe that beyond the taboo of 9-11, the one thing that I've got to say is that it's declared taboo by the entire military industrial media, by the fake liberals, the fake leftists, even the populists.
[02:39:56.187 --> 02:40:01.635]  All of them has been any consideration of a Marxist or a socialist analysis.
[02:40:01.695 --> 02:40:11.168]  And I think even people like Counterpunch has pointed out that we can't believe anything of these so-called regimes in Russia at this point.
[02:40:11.956 --> 02:40:16.380]  Or any of their so-called archives that have been gone over totally by the FBI and the CIA.
[02:40:16.420 --> 02:40:17.500]  Let me just stop you, John.
[02:40:17.541 --> 02:40:21.403]  We can't, John, John, we can't do a history lesson because our guest is on with us, but let me just stop you.
[02:40:21.423 --> 02:40:25.286]  You know, I'm a free market Ron Paul type, but you're not being censored here.
[02:40:25.306 --> 02:40:26.367]  Nobody screened your call.
[02:40:26.647 --> 02:40:33.773]  If you want to give us a minute and a half analysis of a leftist Marxist analysis of economics, go ahead.
[02:40:39.679 --> 02:40:49.962]  I would actually disagree with the caller because there's an old quote from a Nobel Prize winner that said, men in order to do evil must first believe what they are doing is good.
[02:40:50.502 --> 02:40:54.183]  I don't believe that these neoconservatives think they're doing evil.
[02:40:54.223 --> 02:40:55.364]  They think they're doing good.
[02:40:55.744 --> 02:41:00.566]  And that's what's most frightening about it because, I mean, they enact God's name just as...
[02:41:02.785 --> 02:41:16.561]  You know, the radical Islam that enacts God's name and believes that they are doing good and that is what allows them to go to sleep at night with a clear conscience after having murdered 3,000 Americans with a lot more on the agenda.
[02:41:17.099 --> 02:41:27.488]  You know, I think it's too simple to say that, you know, they're evildoers and they're doing evil and it's just about the corporate block.
[02:41:27.528 --> 02:41:28.449]  Let me say something here.
[02:41:28.809 --> 02:41:30.731]  They use the fake Christian angle.
[02:41:30.971 --> 02:41:33.113]  We know they're not really Christians, Bush and others.
[02:41:34.234 --> 02:41:35.976]  As a way to sell their constituents.
[02:41:36.297 --> 02:41:37.758]  I say they're fake at that level.
[02:41:38.159 --> 02:41:41.683]  Now, do they believe that they should be running things so it justifies the means?
[02:41:42.544 --> 02:41:43.926]  Are they students of Machiavelli?
[02:41:44.206 --> 02:41:44.727]  We know they are.
[02:41:44.767 --> 02:41:47.069]  They're Straussians.
[02:41:47.150 --> 02:41:50.133]  So I agree with you in that respect, Steve.
[02:41:50.313 --> 02:41:51.555]  But go ahead and finish up, John.
[02:41:52.529 --> 02:41:54.090]  Yeah, well, just an answer to that.
[02:41:54.810 --> 02:41:59.774]  I think there's too many people that are giving this idea that this is a matter of incompetence.
[02:41:59.814 --> 02:42:00.894]  They're well-intentioned.
[02:42:01.014 --> 02:42:05.517]  All of the presidential candidates run by the military-industrial complex use that line.
[02:42:05.877 --> 02:42:07.839]  No, we can't read their mind.
[02:42:07.879 --> 02:42:12.662]  We can look at their actions, and we can look at their knowledge of their own evil and call that evil.
[02:42:12.682 --> 02:42:16.164]  But I wanted to say that if somebody wants to look at, for instance...
[02:42:17.468 --> 02:42:26.376]  The genesis of libertarianism, you can Google up Mr. Anonymous, the not-so-spontaneous libertarian.
[02:42:26.416 --> 02:42:28.718]  Mr. Anonymous, not-so-spontaneous libertarian.
[02:42:29.059 --> 02:42:39.288]  Though I agree totally with what you're talking about, Alex, about the police state dangers, the wars, the false flag terrorism, and Ron Paul on those issues, I think is dangerous.
[02:42:39.778 --> 02:42:44.040]  To eliminate the social safety spending, which is not even socialism.
[02:42:44.060 --> 02:42:45.040]  Hey, it's already gone.
[02:42:45.100 --> 02:42:46.661]  Listen, I appreciate your call, okay?
[02:42:46.721 --> 02:42:47.841]  I mean, it's a moot point.
[02:42:47.942 --> 02:42:53.124]  And look, I'm not saying social safety networks couldn't help people if angels ran the government.
[02:42:53.324 --> 02:42:56.185]  But it's always control freaks that are going to use it to hurt people.
[02:42:56.605 --> 02:42:58.266]  Steve, Alton, any comments?
[02:42:59.767 --> 02:43:01.647]  I agree, and always to make a buck.
[02:43:01.887 --> 02:43:04.168]  Always take care of their constituents who are making a buck.
[02:43:04.669 --> 02:43:06.289]  All right, who's up next here in order, John?
[02:43:06.329 --> 02:43:07.750]  I've got my list messed up here.
[02:43:08.439 --> 02:43:09.359]  Stacey in Ohio.
[02:43:09.379 --> 02:43:09.859]  You're on the air.
[02:43:09.879 --> 02:43:10.719]  A lot of calls from Ohio.
[02:43:10.759 --> 02:43:11.059]  Go ahead.
[02:43:11.840 --> 02:43:12.580]  Idaho, actually.
[02:43:13.020 --> 02:43:13.740]  Idaho, okay.
[02:43:14.440 --> 02:43:20.541]  Your question was about if you think this book is going to help people realize the truth about 9-11.
[02:43:20.561 --> 02:43:29.203]  I don't think it is because once people are going to start catching on to it, they're going to do something to try to stop it.
[02:43:29.263 --> 02:43:33.824]  The whole freedom of Internet thing is really pushing the movement.
[02:43:33.844 --> 02:43:35.144]  They're going to try to take that away.
[02:43:36.337 --> 02:43:42.362]  And something's going to happen, I think, before another terrorist attack, and then the Bush administration could say, oh, see, we told you so.
[02:43:43.302 --> 02:43:44.423]  We told you we needed this.
[02:43:44.463 --> 02:43:45.904]  We told you we need to go in Iraq.
[02:43:45.945 --> 02:43:46.705]  Now we need to go in Iraq.
[02:43:46.745 --> 02:43:55.012]  Well, remember years ago I warned before the next false flag that some of their legislation to, quote, keep us safe wouldn't go through, and Bush would say, we're about to be hit.
[02:43:55.232 --> 02:43:56.353]  I don't have the power I need.
[02:43:56.373 --> 02:43:58.374]  I know, and I agree with that.
[02:43:58.494 --> 02:44:00.616]  And then they hit us, and then they say, oh, yeah.
[02:44:01.738 --> 02:44:02.859]  Everybody thinks I'm crazy.
[02:44:02.959 --> 02:44:03.599]  Everybody at work.
[02:44:03.639 --> 02:44:05.499]  I try to talk to everybody that I can about it.
[02:44:05.539 --> 02:44:06.120]  My family.
[02:44:06.140 --> 02:44:07.140]  Well, the yuppies think it's crazy.
[02:44:07.160 --> 02:44:09.360]  My friends laughing at me right now and what we're talking to.
[02:44:10.141 --> 02:44:11.141]  I think about it all the time.
[02:44:11.161 --> 02:44:13.402]  I'm obsessed with it, and it pisses me off.
[02:44:13.722 --> 02:44:15.602]  I feel like there's nothing that I can do about it.
[02:44:15.682 --> 02:44:18.863]  Now, do people at your work think the dollar's still worth the same, and they think that's funny, too?
[02:44:18.923 --> 02:44:20.244]  Actually, I work in a bank, so...
[02:44:21.384 --> 02:44:22.425]  Well, they're totally brainwashed.
[02:44:22.465 --> 02:44:23.166]  Let them be slaves.
[02:44:23.506 --> 02:44:26.529]  Hey, listen, listen, listen, Stacey.
[02:44:26.869 --> 02:44:28.190]  Let the dead bury the dead.
[02:44:28.451 --> 02:44:29.752]  Just stop trying to wake them up.
[02:44:29.792 --> 02:44:31.854]  They want to laugh and giggle and snicker.
[02:44:32.054 --> 02:44:34.036]  There's plenty of people that do want to hear from you.
[02:44:34.576 --> 02:44:35.857]  But finish up your point.
[02:44:35.877 --> 02:44:36.098]  Sorry.
[02:44:36.958 --> 02:44:37.959]  Well, what can I do?
[02:44:37.999 --> 02:44:39.220]  I mean, what kind of information?
[02:44:39.260 --> 02:44:43.764]  Like, your guest now, where does he get his information about, you know, NORAD standing down?
[02:44:43.804 --> 02:44:46.467]  Well, let me just answer that question for you, but first let me say this.
[02:44:47.523 --> 02:44:51.204]  If you aren't completely appalled, you're not paying attention, as the bumper sticker says.
[02:44:51.724 --> 02:44:55.666]  And if they don't know something's fundamentally wrong, doesn't mean they have to agree with you.
[02:44:56.466 --> 02:44:58.847]  Then they're idiots, and you just need to move on.
[02:44:58.867 --> 02:44:59.827]  They're never going to wake up.
[02:45:00.568 --> 02:45:00.868]  Steve?
[02:45:02.268 --> 02:45:08.810]  Well, Stacy, and if this sounds self-serving, it's not meant to be, but here's the solution, one of the solutions.
[02:45:08.830 --> 02:45:10.591]  Buy them a copy of the shell game.
[02:45:11.195 --> 02:45:14.076]  Because it's a wolf in sheep's clothing.
[02:45:14.356 --> 02:45:15.717]  They're not going to know what they're getting.
[02:45:15.757 --> 02:45:16.557]  It's just a thriller.
[02:45:16.637 --> 02:45:18.978]  And once they start reading it, they're not going to be able to pull it down.
[02:45:19.299 --> 02:45:21.860]  And when they're done, they're going to be different.
[02:45:22.500 --> 02:45:23.660]  They're going to be taken by it.
[02:45:24.181 --> 02:45:28.803]  And by the way, Steve, the story's going to hook them, and the information in there is going to seep into their mind.
[02:45:29.143 --> 02:45:31.264]  And for the first time, they're going to open their eyes and awaken.
[02:45:31.524 --> 02:45:35.225]  And Steve, you've had a bunch of big bestsellers.
[02:45:35.265 --> 02:45:38.227]  You're taking a risk of being blackballed by putting this book out.
[02:45:38.267 --> 02:45:38.967]  We've got to commend you.
[02:45:40.217 --> 02:45:41.378]  I've already been blackballed.
[02:45:41.418 --> 02:45:43.839]  I mean, none of my New York publishers would touch the book.
[02:45:44.580 --> 02:45:48.523]  I was supposed to speak on a Los Angeles book festival panel.
[02:45:48.843 --> 02:45:53.306]  They were really excited to get me on there, and they mysteriously canceled a couple weeks later.
[02:45:53.326 --> 02:45:55.787]  I've been kept off the major shows.
[02:45:56.007 --> 02:45:57.288]  But here's the one.
[02:45:57.508 --> 02:46:03.933]  I've been on the Today Show before, Kathleen Cryer's report, Fox News, almost every station, hundreds of interviews.
[02:46:04.973 --> 02:46:08.856]  Your audience has the power to get me onto the mainstream media.
[02:46:09.375 --> 02:46:33.418]  If they do simply one thing, between now and Tuesday, which is when the New York Times book seller's list comes out, between now and Tuesday, if they simply go to Amazon.com or Barnes & Noble and Borders and buy two copies, one for themselves and one copy of the show game for somebody like Stacy's relatives or friends at the bank who just will never listen to her, your audience's numbers are so vast.
[02:46:33.985 --> 02:46:37.167]  That that would push the book into the top 10 New York Times bestseller list.
[02:46:37.187 --> 02:46:38.348]  It's hit 31 already.
[02:46:38.748 --> 02:46:44.412]  But that would push it to top 10, and what that would do is force it into the top 100 newspapers in the country the next week.
[02:46:44.972 --> 02:46:54.458]  And suddenly, the Bill O'Reilly, the Bill Maher, the Tonight Show, I'd be able to get a venue to talk about this stuff on those venues.
[02:46:55.298 --> 02:46:55.619]  I hear you.
[02:46:55.639 --> 02:46:56.219]  We've got to jump.
[02:46:56.239 --> 02:46:57.440]  Thank you for the call, Stacey.
[02:46:57.980 --> 02:47:00.562]  Aaron, where are you calling from?
[02:47:01.302 --> 02:47:01.823]  Ohio.
[02:47:02.063 --> 02:47:02.363]  Welcome.
[02:47:03.662 --> 02:47:03.922]  Thanks.
[02:47:03.982 --> 02:47:05.883]  I've got three points.
[02:47:06.143 --> 02:47:14.708]  One, I was wondering, you know, I'm 17, so there's not much I can do about gold and silver, but I do have some money saved up.
[02:47:15.068 --> 02:47:15.988]  What should I do?
[02:47:16.708 --> 02:47:18.489]  That money's being devalued right now.
[02:47:18.569 --> 02:47:18.870]  I don't know.
[02:47:18.890 --> 02:47:19.910]  I'm not going to tell you what to do with it.
[02:47:19.930 --> 02:47:21.391]  All right.
[02:47:21.731 --> 02:47:27.814]  And I also want to say that with the book, I'm not sure how...
[02:47:28.610 --> 02:47:35.437]  Many, you know, newspapers and things like that will take it because I think they will take it as fiction and nothing else.
[02:47:35.697 --> 02:47:37.960]  Well, for people that read, it's a great tool.
[02:47:38.340 --> 02:47:39.341]  Most people don't now.
[02:47:39.381 --> 02:47:41.243]  That's why you give them an Endgame or a Terror Storm.
[02:47:41.463 --> 02:47:45.488]  But it's one more great tool, and he is a prominent writer, and we appreciate him joining us.
[02:47:45.528 --> 02:47:46.168]  Thank you, Aaron.
[02:47:46.429 --> 02:47:48.130]  Chris in Florida, last caller for our guest.
[02:47:48.150 --> 02:47:48.611]  Go ahead, Chris.
[02:47:50.376 --> 02:47:55.939]  Yes, I'd like to hear what you and your guests have to say about my recommendations when calling up talk shows.
[02:47:56.919 --> 02:47:58.380]  It's unbelievably easy.
[02:47:58.400 --> 02:48:04.704]  You don't have to dress up like you do for TV, so you can stay relatively anonymous while stating hard facts.
[02:48:05.724 --> 02:48:10.167]  And you don't often need to be vague about your reason for calling in order to get on the air.
[02:48:10.207 --> 02:48:14.789]  It's easy to get on the air, even when you tell the call screener exactly what you're calling about.
[02:48:15.205 --> 02:48:15.826]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:15.846 --> 02:48:16.206]  Final segment.
[02:48:45.928 --> 02:48:47.349]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:47.369 --> 02:48:49.470]  A new world order.
[02:48:50.171 --> 02:48:54.173]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:48:54.293 --> 02:48:56.835]  It's known as the Builder Earth.
[02:48:57.896 --> 02:49:00.157]  Would their objective be world domination?
[02:49:00.677 --> 02:49:03.079]  For thousands of years, their dark border grew.
[02:49:03.863 --> 02:49:11.354]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:14.219 --> 02:49:19.186]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:19.666 --> 02:49:23.127]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:23.527 --> 02:49:25.588]  Build-A-Bear is making great progress in the world.
[02:49:26.088 --> 02:49:27.048]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:27.068 --> 02:49:28.009]  They're not after money.
[02:49:28.029 --> 02:49:29.109]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:29.309 --> 02:49:30.149]  They're after power.
[02:49:30.269 --> 02:49:31.310]  That's their app to use it.
[02:49:31.450 --> 02:49:39.632]  Order Endgame on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:49:39.773 --> 02:49:42.934]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:49:42.974 --> 02:49:44.114]  You have been warned.
[02:49:44.858 --> 02:49:49.419]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[02:49:49.820 --> 02:49:52.761]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[02:49:53.081 --> 02:49:55.641]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[02:49:56.002 --> 02:50:00.823]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state, nullifying our First Amendment.
[02:50:01.203 --> 02:50:06.565]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[02:50:06.865 --> 02:50:09.826]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act,
[02:50:10.026 --> 02:50:10.606]  We're good to go.
[02:50:25.396 --> 02:50:28.299]  It says, If any man worship the beast, take notice.
[02:50:28.659 --> 02:50:30.260]  It says, Worship the beast.
[02:50:30.540 --> 02:50:33.163]  This issue is about worship, not economics.
[02:50:33.443 --> 02:50:38.907]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[02:50:39.048 --> 02:50:39.348]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[02:50:44.893 --> 02:50:45.534]  It's a fact.
[02:50:45.754 --> 02:50:53.242]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[02:50:53.362 --> 02:51:02.212]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[02:51:02.492 --> 02:51:13.057]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecure debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[02:51:13.297 --> 02:51:19.320]  We can terminate your unsecure debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[02:51:19.480 --> 02:51:19.940]  We're good to go.
[02:51:49.787 --> 02:51:52.910]  The broadcast transmission will be over here in about five minutes.
[02:51:52.970 --> 02:52:01.277]  We had an unbelievable economist on with us in the second hour, if you missed it, and tons of economic news in the first hour.
[02:52:01.837 --> 02:52:13.827]  The restreams on the Internet, if you're not listening on an AM or FM station or you missed any of it, start consecutively all the way, the show re-airing back-to-back, until I come back live Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:52:13.887 --> 02:52:14.968]  Central Standard Time.
[02:52:16.750 --> 02:52:18.490]  Don't have any time to take any more of your calls.
[02:52:18.510 --> 02:52:20.071]  I have a few final news stories I want to hit.
[02:52:20.511 --> 02:52:25.012]  I just wanted to tell Steve Alton thanks for coming on and thanks for writing The Shell Game.
[02:52:25.032 --> 02:52:28.553]  I'm going to give it to my wife who's a voracious reader who reads a book about it every day.
[02:52:29.653 --> 02:52:33.014]  And we look forward to having you back on and wish you all the luck, Steve.
[02:52:34.214 --> 02:52:40.456]  Well, it's an honor and it's also an honor to carry the message for the people who seek the truth and I will do my best.
[02:52:41.276 --> 02:52:41.936]  Thank you, my friend.
[02:52:41.956 --> 02:52:42.996]  Thanks for spending time with us.
[02:52:43.536 --> 02:52:45.537]  Before I hit a final news story or two,
[02:52:48.362 --> 02:52:49.684]  I've got to tell you about Interfood.
[02:52:50.084 --> 02:52:56.312]  They've got healthy coffees, healthy cocoa, but their main product, one that made them famous, is their green food.
[02:52:57.053 --> 02:53:01.038]  20 superfoods in two little scoops in your juice, your apple juice, your orange juice.
[02:53:01.758 --> 02:53:06.905]  The fields are, even if it's organic, have really lost a lot of their nutritive value.
[02:53:08.263 --> 02:53:09.625]  You need extra vitamins.
[02:53:09.645 --> 02:53:11.126]  You absorb 100% of these.
[02:53:11.186 --> 02:53:17.394]  Dulp, kelp, barley grass, wheatgrass, corolla, spirulina, balance energy all day long, detoxing effects.
[02:53:17.514 --> 02:53:20.418]  Go to InfoWars.com and link through to their banner.
[02:53:21.024 --> 02:53:27.410]  And you get 10% off as an InfoWars reader by linking through to Interfood to that subpage from InfoWars.
[02:53:27.770 --> 02:53:28.691]  So go to Interfood.com or 1-866-762-9238.
[02:53:28.711 --> 02:53:28.791]  1-866-762-9238.
[02:53:28.811 --> 02:53:29.672]  And there is still time.
[02:53:29.712 --> 02:53:31.954]  They shell out at least the last two conferences I knew of.
[02:53:40.502 --> 02:53:41.384]  I'm told sold out.
[02:53:41.644 --> 02:53:42.826]  Very professionally done.
[02:53:43.066 --> 02:53:44.428]  People love these conferences.
[02:53:44.769 --> 02:53:47.653]  Freedom Law School's 2008 Justice, Peace, and Freedom Conference.
[02:53:47.933 --> 02:53:50.938]  There's a lot of patriot conferences that are coop-filled, and I won't plug them.
[02:53:51.969 --> 02:53:53.089]  This is all good people.
[02:53:53.149 --> 02:53:59.852]  William Rodriguez, Jason Bermas, G. Edward Griffin, Tommy Cryer, Joe Bannister, Larry Becraft, Michael Collins Piper, so many more.
[02:54:00.692 --> 02:54:03.813]  That's going to be in Irvine, California, March 28th to the 31st.
[02:54:03.874 --> 02:54:06.935]  Get your tickets now by calling 760-868-4271, 760-868-4271, or livefreenow.org.
[02:54:06.955 --> 02:54:07.975]  That's livefreenow.org.
[02:54:08.015 --> 02:54:09.135]  I meant to get into...
[02:54:19.184 --> 02:54:20.426]  This is looking worse and worse.
[02:54:20.466 --> 02:54:28.395]  They provocateur the flashbang bombing of the Army Recruiting Center that's shut down most of the time because they can't even recruit people.
[02:54:29.336 --> 02:54:31.459]  It's a way of making the government look like it's under attack.
[02:54:31.499 --> 02:54:33.602]  More police state measures while the border's wide open.
[02:54:34.443 --> 02:54:37.446]  ABC News reported it was connected to a peace group.
[02:54:37.466 --> 02:54:38.748]  Now they admit that's not true.
[02:54:39.785 --> 02:54:46.531]  Howard Dean is trying to have a re-election in Michigan and Florida so Hillary Clinton can get the delegates.
[02:54:46.571 --> 02:54:47.492]  That's in the AP.
[02:54:48.052 --> 02:54:50.034]  That is just right out in everybody's face.
[02:54:53.457 --> 02:54:58.942]  There is so much more that is going on that we'll be covering coming up Sunday.
[02:54:58.962 --> 02:54:59.342]  But here it is.
[02:54:59.382 --> 02:55:02.805]  Times Square blast link with anti-war demonstrator AP.
[02:55:02.865 --> 02:55:06.088]  Photos of targeted military recruiting station were sent to members of Congress.
[02:55:06.812 --> 02:55:20.241]  And then it turns out, in another article, ABC's now having to admit that that is not the case, but the neocons are still on talk radio saying that's the case, because they need an excuse to turn their police and military apparatus.
[02:55:20.481 --> 02:55:22.402]  You've heard them saying, arrest 9-11 truthers.
[02:55:22.683 --> 02:55:27.065]  You've heard O'Reilly and all of them in the talking point, if it's going to get violent, peace groups are going to get violent.
[02:55:27.346 --> 02:55:33.910]  And if you look at the 60s, 70s, and before, the feds would provocateur, either run organizations, command people to do it, or do it and blame people.
[02:55:34.432 --> 02:55:35.073]  We're good to go.
[02:55:35.113 --> 02:55:35.333]  I think?
[02:55:54.346 --> 02:55:58.449]  And so if you tune in right now at InfoWars.com, if you missed it, you'll be able to hear it.
[02:55:58.730 --> 02:56:00.751]  The first and second hour are about to restart.
[02:56:00.791 --> 02:56:04.494]  The show will continue at InfoWars.com right now.
[02:56:04.514 --> 02:56:10.859]  You've got to go to those streams to listen, though, and I recommend you do because the shows just get more and more powerful each and every day.
[02:56:11.020 --> 02:56:13.281]  Or you can catch it throughout the weekend until I'm back live Sunday, 4 to 6.
[02:56:14.626 --> 02:56:17.589]  To all of our M&M affiliates, support them, support their sponsors.
[02:56:17.889 --> 02:56:19.471]  To all of our listeners, God bless you.
[02:56:19.731 --> 02:56:20.652]  Have a great weekend.
[02:56:20.672 --> 02:56:22.493]  Get out there and take on the new world order.
[02:56:22.674 --> 02:56:24.055]  We'll see you Sunday live for what's next.
[02:56:24.175 --> 02:56:25.817]  We'll be right back at InfoWars.com.
