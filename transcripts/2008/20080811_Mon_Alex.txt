[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.851]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:00:01.911 --> 00:00:03.533]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.478 --> 00:00:22.845]  Ladies and gentlemen, gigantic developments on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:00:22.885 --> 00:00:25.569]  Top story, American mercenary captured by Russians.
[00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.933]  Confirmed by multiple mainstream sources.
[00:00:28.973 --> 00:00:31.537]  We know 1,000 Marines were there taking part in drills.
[00:00:32.578 --> 00:00:34.420]  Hundreds of confirmed U.S.
[00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:43.107]  Army Special Forces, major Israeli newspapers as we reported earlier, and we have links to those up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:00:43.967 --> 00:00:50.072]  More than a thousand Israeli troops led by Israeli mercenaries.
[00:00:50.673 --> 00:00:53.815]  The Georgian military is commanded by an Israeli national.
[00:00:54.196 --> 00:00:56.177]  That's all listed here by the BBC.
[00:00:57.058 --> 00:00:58.880]  Also their foreign minister is an Israeli.
[00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.982]  So this is a NATO-Israeli-Ukrainian-British sneak attack launched Thursday night on the eve of the Olympics.
[00:01:06.322 --> 00:01:08.943]  The media is spinning it and saying that Russia attacked them.
[00:01:09.303 --> 00:01:15.605]  They destroyed an entire city, killing thousands, continuing to attack with their self-propelled rocket batteries.
[00:01:15.665 --> 00:01:22.127]  The Russians have been fighting back and are now, for several days, driving them out of Ossetia and other areas.
[00:01:22.727 --> 00:01:24.807]  They've now entered into central Georgia.
[00:01:24.867 --> 00:01:26.488]  The fighting is intensifying.
[00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.495]  General Petraeus reported today in the Associated Press he is sending in U.S.
[00:01:32.555 --> 00:01:36.800]  military C-130s with 2,000 Georgian reinforcements that were in Iraq.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.360]  U.S.
[00:01:37.421 --> 00:01:39.703]  aircraft are flying into the zone.
[00:01:40.104 --> 00:01:41.726]  Petraeus says to back up.
[00:01:41.786 --> 00:01:44.749]  So our government is delivering troops to the front line.
[00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.351]  And don't think the Russians won't send Heinz in.
[00:01:47.611 --> 00:01:54.074]  They've said anybody supporting the conflict, anybody attacking Russian forces or supplying them will be attacked.
[00:01:54.094 --> 00:02:03.578]  They've told the international community and all the nations that border, including Ukraine, the Black Sea, that any ships trying to deliver weapons, they've told the Israelis this, out of Turkey.
[00:02:04.398 --> 00:02:09.522]  They told Turkey, anybody trying to deliver weapons into Georgia will be attacked.
[00:02:09.842 --> 00:02:11.944]  Russian submarines are there on alert.
[00:02:12.264 --> 00:02:17.528]  Russian battleships and missile cruisers have been sinking Georgian ships.
[00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:19.510]  This is insane.
[00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.733]  NATO instructor taken hostage with Georgians amid reports of U.S.
[00:02:23.753 --> 00:02:27.276]  military commanding thousands of mercenaries in proxy war.
[00:02:27.816 --> 00:02:30.117]  Paul Joseph Watson, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:02:30.457 --> 00:02:37.199]  An American mercenary has been captured by Russian forces along with a number of Georgian soldiers, according to a report from the Russian news website.
[00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:39.980]  And it goes on, providing more evidence that U.S.
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.061]  and NATO are covertly supporting the Georgian Army in a proxy war against Russia.
[00:02:44.822 --> 00:02:51.864]  According to the report, which is a major Russian daily, the mercenary is an African-American who is a NATO instructor and an ordnance specialist.
[00:02:51.884 --> 00:02:54.705]  He has now been transferred to the Russian base of
[00:02:56.363 --> 00:02:57.484]  Vlada Vaskovs.
[00:02:58.104 --> 00:03:05.809]  It goes on, the story also backs up previous reports of dead black Americans being found dead in the capital of South Ossetia wearing U.S.
[00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:06.449]  uniforms.
[00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.071]  We played those Russia Today, that's the equivalent of CNN.
[00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:10.351]  U.S.
[00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:17.736]  soldiers recently conducted training programs where they instructed Georgian soldiers how to deal with unexploded ordnances as part of a Georgian train and equip program.
[00:03:18.786 --> 00:03:22.249]  And it is a serious escalation.
[00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:30.517]  Now, he was on with us about two and a half weeks ago and he said Russia is going to start bringing more oil and gas to market.
[00:03:30.837 --> 00:03:32.799]  People have been pointing this out over the web, the interview.
[00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:36.662]  He said there will be major confrontations with Russia in the next year.
[00:03:37.543 --> 00:03:39.244]  Over them trying to bring this to market.
[00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:47.090]  BP owns the end of the pipeline, which applies more than 1%, which doesn't sound like a lot, but that's enough to really shake things up.
[00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.513]  Just that one pipeline that goes into the Black Sea and then into Turkey.
[00:03:52.476 --> 00:03:53.857]  Uh, very, very serious.
[00:04:22.796 --> 00:04:28.040]  More of what your New World Order source said specifically about confrontations with Russia.
[00:04:30.021 --> 00:04:32.383]  Alex, thank you for the privilege of being on with you today.
[00:04:32.923 --> 00:04:35.524]  The standard currency of the world is crude oil.
[00:04:36.305 --> 00:04:40.187]  Everything that you're seeing happen today is about crude oil.
[00:04:41.288 --> 00:04:41.969]  It's nothing else.
[00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:44.010]  They really don't care about people.
[00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.893]  It wasn't a matter of the fact that Saddam Hussein killed so many people in Iraq.
[00:04:49.497 --> 00:04:54.781]  After all, George Bush has seen more people murdered over there and killed than what Saddam ever did.
[00:04:55.161 --> 00:04:56.042]  Same thing in Georgia.
[00:04:56.062 --> 00:04:56.942]  Well, he was our boy!
[00:04:57.002 --> 00:04:58.043]  It was about crude oil.
[00:04:58.283 --> 00:05:00.765]  He was our boy, in fact, until they set him up to go into Kuwait.
[00:05:01.746 --> 00:05:01.986]  Sure.
[00:05:02.146 --> 00:05:03.247]  It's all about crude oil.
[00:05:04.247 --> 00:05:04.748]  Iran.
[00:05:05.208 --> 00:05:07.470]  I'm so glad that you had Ron Paul on the other day.
[00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:08.951]  Congratulations, Alec.
[00:05:09.551 --> 00:05:15.656]  You're listening audience are some of the most privileged people on the face of this earth, because they get everything up to date every day.
[00:05:15.696 --> 00:05:19.038]  I don't know how you do such an amazing job of it, but Ron Paul talking about
[00:05:19.574 --> 00:05:23.436]  What's going to happen in Iran, every bit of it is about crude oil.
[00:05:23.557 --> 00:05:26.398]  Iran, Iraq, Georgia, Russia, every bit of it.
[00:05:26.458 --> 00:05:33.403]  And eight weeks ago, when this individual called me in order to threaten me, he said, Lindsey, you can't talk about certain things anymore.
[00:05:33.463 --> 00:05:39.566]  And again, this is a big oil exec you worked for for several years, worked with, but please continue.
[00:05:40.947 --> 00:05:43.529]  Well, I was a chaplain on the Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline.
[00:05:44.005 --> 00:05:54.131]  And because I was doing such a job for them, they gave me executive status and invited me to sit in on their board meetings in an advisory capacity in order to help the relationship between management and labor.
[00:05:54.572 --> 00:05:57.494]  And because of it, I got to know a lot of these top people.
[00:05:57.894 --> 00:06:01.296]  Well, I had not seen this man for about 20 years, or talked with him.
[00:06:01.676 --> 00:06:06.559]  And he called me up on the phone to threaten me and say, you can't talk about certain things anymore.
[00:06:06.619 --> 00:06:12.243]  Well, after we agreed, and I did everything that he said, including pulling my website and my DVD,
[00:06:12.936 --> 00:06:17.642]  And then I decided I'd be polite and kind to him, and I said, how's your family?
[00:06:17.682 --> 00:06:18.443]  Where you been living?
[00:06:19.164 --> 00:06:21.547]  He really became very friendly.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:28.825]  And then I began to ask him questions, and when I asked him the questions, he readily answered me just as if he'd been in the board meetings lately.
[00:06:29.205 --> 00:06:31.968]  And that, Alex, is where I came by my information.
[00:06:32.008 --> 00:06:35.610]  You know, people so often think, oh, Lindsey Williams, you're a prophet.
[00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:36.171]  No, I'm not.
[00:06:36.491 --> 00:06:38.553]  I put on my breeches every morning just like you do.
[00:06:38.993 --> 00:06:44.417]  It's just the fact that there are certain contacts that I still have amongst the elite
[00:06:44.761 --> 00:06:45.322]  We're good to go.
[00:07:07.523 --> 00:07:16.435]  Well, Lindsey, let's get into specifics because everybody was freaking out on YouTube comments and on my InfoWars.com comments pages.
[00:07:16.455 --> 00:07:17.677]  You can comment below the pages.
[00:07:17.717 --> 00:07:18.998]  People are using it as a message board.
[00:07:19.799 --> 00:07:22.042]  That is, people can comment on the stories to be specific.
[00:07:23.852 --> 00:07:30.434]  And they're all pointing out that you had talked about confrontation with Russia in and around Central Asia and Eastern Europe when you were on.
[00:07:30.814 --> 00:07:38.717]  I don't have the staff of the time to go back and listen to the three or four hours of interviews we did two or three weeks ago, but then I brought that up to you and you said, well, yes, I did.
[00:07:38.997 --> 00:07:45.299]  You know, he did tell me that there will be escalating tensions in that region with the Russians.
[00:07:45.319 --> 00:07:47.840]  Did he say anything else about that?
[00:07:49.025 --> 00:07:59.571]  Okay, let me give you the context in which that was given to me, because there again, let me stress, I only say what I have been told by, and this person gave me certain things.
[00:07:59.611 --> 00:08:03.673]  He said, the price of crude oil is going to $50 a barrel eventually.
[00:08:03.754 --> 00:08:06.055]  It'll probably go up more before it goes there.
[00:08:06.495 --> 00:08:18.322]  He said we're going to open up two major oil fields in the world in order to flood the world with crude oil and basically destroy the economies of the Middle East, the oil-producing countries of the Arabs,
[00:08:18.726 --> 00:08:19.286]  I don't think so.
[00:08:37.904 --> 00:08:43.847]  That Russia is going to become the leading major financial power in the world.
[00:08:43.867 --> 00:08:49.209]  Do you realize right now that there are more millionaires in Russia than in any other country in the world?
[00:08:50.069 --> 00:08:52.951]  And it's all about oil.
[00:08:53.251 --> 00:09:06.997]  So, in the context of the fact that he said they're going to have this major oil field found in Russia, that Russia's going to supply most of the oil for the world, beginning almost immediately, whenever this oil field is announced, which it was on July the 24th,
[00:09:08.824 --> 00:09:13.808]  I knew that we would have confrontations with Russia from that point on.
[00:09:13.908 --> 00:09:16.990]  Then, Georgia comes up, and what's it all about?
[00:09:17.711 --> 00:09:18.552]  Oil pipeline?
[00:09:19.132 --> 00:09:20.033]  Oil in Georgia?
[00:09:20.433 --> 00:09:22.215]  Natural gas going through Georgia?
[00:09:22.635 --> 00:09:27.779]  Russia has interest in Georgia because of oil and natural gas?
[00:09:28.219 --> 00:09:31.602]  And every bit of this all revolves around one thing, oil.
[00:09:31.702 --> 00:09:36.026]  So we definitely, I could gather from the context of what this man said,
[00:09:36.508 --> 00:09:41.971]  We can expect over the next few years more and more and more power to be vested in Russia.
[00:09:41.991 --> 00:09:46.914]  Now did you extrapolate that or deduce that or did he specifically say we're going to have confrontations with Russia?
[00:09:47.774 --> 00:09:49.575]  No, I extrapolated that.
[00:09:49.835 --> 00:10:03.543]  He did not say we're going to have confrontations with Russia, but I knew that if Russia becomes the financial power that he said it was going to, and that there is this major oil field that will supply the majority of oil for the world from Russia,
[00:10:04.008 --> 00:10:08.390]  I knew that this meant confrontations with Russia, but I didn't expect it to happen this quickly.
[00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:13.312]  Lindsey, why don't you call him back again and ask him some more questions?
[00:10:13.853 --> 00:10:15.213]  I mean, have you only talked to him twice?
[00:10:16.794 --> 00:10:17.995]  I've talked to him three times.
[00:10:19.455 --> 00:10:21.196]  Okay, well, when's the last time you talked to him?
[00:10:24.578 --> 00:10:26.279]  About three weeks ago.
[00:10:26.999 --> 00:10:28.800]  So right around the time you were on my show last?
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.381]  Just before I was on your show.
[00:10:31.521 --> 00:10:33.162]  What was the last thing you talked to him about?
[00:10:34.483 --> 00:10:38.748]  I asked him, I said, what can I say that what you've told me?
[00:10:38.828 --> 00:10:40.390]  You've told me these things are going to happen.
[00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:44.114]  And I said, I don't want to get in trouble and definitely don't want you to threaten me again.
[00:10:44.995 --> 00:10:48.979]  I said, can I say Lindsey Williams thinks these things are going to happen?
[00:10:49.039 --> 00:10:51.442]  He said, as long as you leave my name out of it, you can't.
[00:10:53.605 --> 00:10:54.566]  What a nice gangster.
[00:10:56.664 --> 00:10:58.465]  Well, you need to call him back, Lindsey.
[00:10:58.485 --> 00:11:01.908]  You need to call him back and pick his brain about some more things that are happening.
[00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:10.195]  Now, obviously, the discovery of this Russian oil, and they're discovering fields everywhere, I mean, that alone shouldn't drive the price down, because they have to then bring it to market.
[00:11:10.675 --> 00:11:13.718]  The imploding dollar is what has driven oil up, and every summer,
[00:11:14.622 --> 00:11:27.846]  I mean, this could be him being right, or it could be that every summer for the last six years, it's been going up to an all-time high, then dropping during the fall and winter, late summer, fall and winter, and then going back up in spring into mid-summer, and then back down.
[00:11:27.886 --> 00:11:28.646]  I mean, that's how it works.
[00:11:28.666 --> 00:11:29.607]  You have a 12-month...
[00:11:30.507 --> 00:11:42.714]  In front of you and in the first part of the year it's low and then it goes to the middle part of the year and goes up and then it goes back down into the end of the year into the start of the next year.
[00:11:42.854 --> 00:11:45.936]  So I'm not saying that this person isn't a real source.
[00:11:45.976 --> 00:11:50.698]  I know you've got good sources and we know where you worked and what you were around and what you did in your position.
[00:11:51.199 --> 00:11:52.880]  Everything you've talked about has ended up happening.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.661]  I'm just throwing that out there.
[00:11:55.521 --> 00:11:57.743]  Looking at all the different options here.
[00:11:58.063 --> 00:11:59.605]  Lindsey Williams is our guest.
[00:11:59.625 --> 00:12:05.070]  You'll be able to talk to him on the other side of this break at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:06.671]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:12:07.913 --> 00:12:10.415]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:12:11.096 --> 00:12:17.742]  Did you know there's an assault upon America's freedom of religion by the United Nations Genocide Convention Treaty?
[00:12:18.923 --> 00:12:21.165]  The laws are called hate crime laws.
[00:12:22.003 --> 00:12:28.248]  These laws will eventually shut down Christianity in America by accusing Christians of hate crimes.
[00:12:29.129 --> 00:12:37.235]  These laws are already being used in Canada, Britain, Australia, and Sweden against Christians for reading certain Bible passages.
[00:12:38.256 --> 00:12:46.122]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:13:07.336 --> 00:13:10.358]  Alabama state code makes it illegal to drive barefoot.
[00:13:10.719 --> 00:13:14.101]  In Downey, California, it's illegal to wash your car in the street.
[00:13:14.421 --> 00:13:18.164]  In Minnesota, you can be fined for displaying that your vehicle is for sale.
[00:13:18.504 --> 00:13:22.908]  These laws are obviously not made to protect us, but instead to help states profit.
[00:13:23.208 --> 00:13:25.750]  The use of red light cameras is another great example.
[00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:31.154]  They intrude on your privacy, are unconstitutional, and cost you valuable time and money.
[00:13:31.635 --> 00:13:37.738]  SprayYourPlate.com is a spray-on photo blocker that protects against red light cameras, toll cameras, and speed cameras.

[00:13:55.894 --> 00:13:56.834]  That's SprayYourPlate.com.

[00:13:58.435 --> 00:13:59.035]  Spray your plate!
[00:14:07.472 --> 00:14:11.133]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:14:11.534 --> 00:14:16.956]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:14:17.436 --> 00:14:18.516]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:14:18.556 --> 00:14:22.598]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:14:23.238 --> 00:14:36.483]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:42.344]  For this reason Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:14:42.644 --> 00:14:48.586]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[00:14:52.286 --> 00:14:52.626]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:14:52.706 --> 00:14:54.727]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[00:14:54.747 --> 00:14:54.807]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:15:07.173 --> 00:15:08.554]  It is a big idea.
[00:15:08.574 --> 00:15:10.696]  A new world order.
[00:15:11.396 --> 00:15:16.239]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.441]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:15:18.661 --> 00:15:20.302]  John, give me new calls, please.
[00:15:21.883 --> 00:15:24.385]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:15:24.425 --> 00:15:25.066]  Just for the guests?
[00:15:26.647 --> 00:15:27.628]  Yeah, go through them, give them to me.
[00:15:27.868 --> 00:15:31.010]  Okay, close your window.
[00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:32.391]  80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:15:33.741 --> 00:15:40.786]  It is a big idea.
[00:15:40.806 --> 00:15:42.907]  A new world order.
[00:15:43.607 --> 00:15:48.390]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:50.651]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:15:51.332 --> 00:15:53.613]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:15:54.113 --> 00:15:56.535]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:04.674]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:16:14.319 --> 00:16:15.240]  I'm gonna play a little bit of this.
[00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:16.321]  I think it says it all.
[00:16:17.821 --> 00:16:21.063]  There's a man going around taking names.
[00:16:22.584 --> 00:16:25.806]  And he decides who to free and who to blame.
[00:16:28.175 --> 00:16:30.976]  Everybody won't be treated all the same.
[00:16:32.837 --> 00:16:42.241]  There'll be a golden ladder reaching down when the man comes around.
[00:16:45.402 --> 00:16:53.485]  The hairs on your arm will stand up at the terror in each sip and in each suck.
[00:16:55.459 --> 00:16:58.321]  Will you partake of that last offered cup?
[00:17:00.423 --> 00:17:04.567]  Or disappear into the potter's ground?
[00:17:06.408 --> 00:17:08.089]  When the man comes around.
[00:17:10.611 --> 00:17:12.913]  Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers.
[00:17:15.175 --> 00:17:17.737]  One hundred million angels singing.
[00:17:17.757 --> 00:17:24.363]  Multitudes are marching to the big cuddle drum.
[00:17:26.511 --> 00:17:48.889]  Voices callin', voices cryin' Some are bornin', some are dyin' It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree The virgins are all trimming their wicks
[00:17:52.674 --> 00:17:54.416]  Lindsay Williams is our guest.
[00:17:54.436 --> 00:17:56.478]  We're going to take your calls in the next segment.
[00:17:56.538 --> 00:18:03.065]  John, Rusty, Brendan, Cody, folks from Arizona, Australia, Arkansas, New Hampshire, you name it.
[00:18:03.085 --> 00:18:03.305]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:18:03.385 --> 00:18:12.054]  In this short segment, any key points that need to be made, Lindsay Williams, in world developments from your inside sources?
[00:18:13.676 --> 00:18:15.818]  The elitists play both sides.
[00:18:16.657 --> 00:18:22.901]  And at this point, Russia is going to be probably the most prominent nation on the face of the earth from this point on.
[00:18:22.981 --> 00:18:31.025]  This man was very emphatic about the fact that this oil field, or combined these two, Indonesia has not been announced yet.
[00:18:31.406 --> 00:18:35.828]  Russia, north of Russia, was announced by Fox News headlines on July the 24th.
[00:18:36.589 --> 00:18:43.172]  These two oil fields combined contain more recoverable oil than all of the Middle East combined.
[00:18:43.213 --> 00:18:43.893]  Iraq, Iran,
[00:18:44.355 --> 00:18:55.485]  Saudi Arabia, Dubai, take everything over there, combine it, and these two oil fields that they said they were going to open up, they're ready to go, will produce more crude oil than all the Middle East combined.
[00:18:55.545 --> 00:18:59.209]  That means that Russia is going to be a major contender.
[00:18:59.249 --> 00:19:01.991]  The United States of America is going to have to take a back seat.
[00:19:02.532 --> 00:19:10.179]  We are not going to be allowed to produce our crude oil from the North Slope of Alaska, that monstrous oil find in Montana.
[00:19:10.766 --> 00:19:12.827]  And North Dakota that we know is there.
[00:19:13.047 --> 00:19:15.208]  None of that is going to be allowed to be opened up.
[00:19:15.588 --> 00:19:25.492]  And as a result, we will have major, my prediction now, this is Lindsey Williams, my prediction is we will have major confrontations with Russia from this point on.
[00:19:27.733 --> 00:19:29.334]  All right, well, very interesting.
[00:19:29.354 --> 00:19:31.215]  Let's go to Brendan in Australia.
[00:19:31.275 --> 00:19:33.095]  Brendan, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:19:34.856 --> 00:19:35.116]  Hello?
[00:19:35.436 --> 00:19:35.977]  Yes, Brendan.
[00:19:36.737 --> 00:19:37.137]  Hi, Alex.
[00:19:37.697 --> 00:19:38.278]  Thanks for having me on.
[00:19:38.338 --> 00:19:39.178]  Hello, Mr. Williams.
[00:19:40.208 --> 00:19:40.989]  Hi there, Brendan.
[00:19:42.349 --> 00:19:43.850]  I just wanted to comment.
[00:19:43.950 --> 00:20:07.124]  I noticed something interesting on the... I was watching CNN, and I saw when the conflict first started, the president, the Georgian president, went on TV and he was saying, talking about issuing a state of war, and he said, actually he said, we're not going to be taking away anybody's democratic freedoms, we're not going to be restricting movement of anyone.
[00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:12.433]  But, you know, Parliament will just be in 24 hours and, you know, other things like that.
[00:20:13.054 --> 00:20:33.749]  And then, after he finished his speech, they had the CNN correspondent sort of wrap it up, and he mentioned, he said, the Georgian President mentioned a state of war, which, you know, means it gives the President special powers to install rules without having to go to Government or Parliament.
[00:20:34.899 --> 00:20:42.062]  Yeah, he came on and lied to the West, and then declared martial law, and they've got all sorts of police state operations in Georgia.
[00:20:42.082 --> 00:20:44.663]  You know, Russia's corrupt, but so is Georgia.
[00:20:44.703 --> 00:20:48.024]  And the whole point here is, Georgia, backed up by Israeli and U.S.
[00:20:48.064 --> 00:20:48.945]  forces, and U.S.
[00:20:48.965 --> 00:20:53.507]  people have now been captured, it's confirmed, running sneak attacks on the Russians.
[00:20:53.567 --> 00:20:56.128]  This is unprecedented escalation.
[00:20:56.148 --> 00:20:56.808]  Lindsey Williams?
[00:20:57.930 --> 00:20:58.690]  Yes, it is.
[00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:09.533]  And I was amazed that this is taking place so quickly because eight weeks ago now, when this man said, we are going to open up this major oil field.
[00:21:09.773 --> 00:21:10.833]  Now, keep in mind something.
[00:21:11.373 --> 00:21:14.414]  Most of the elite are socialistic in their thinking.
[00:21:14.774 --> 00:21:20.835]  So for them to promote Russia and open up this huge oil field and flood the world with it is nothing new.
[00:21:21.336 --> 00:21:23.276]  Now, this means then that Russia
[00:21:23.649 --> 00:21:29.192]  He's going to take advantage of all of the resources that they've got that they know they're going to have in the future.
[00:21:29.792 --> 00:21:35.555]  And now this Georgia situation produces, oh my goodness Alex, this is scary what's happening over there.
[00:21:37.256 --> 00:21:37.816]  Anything else?
[00:21:37.876 --> 00:21:38.977]  Brennan from Australia.
[00:21:41.114 --> 00:21:42.295]  Stay there, stay there Brendan.
[00:21:42.555 --> 00:21:43.035]  Gotta break.
[00:21:43.515 --> 00:21:44.015]  Satellite.
[00:21:44.556 --> 00:21:48.077]  We'll be back with Brendan in Australia, John, Rusty, Cody and many others.
[00:21:48.597 --> 00:21:49.437]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:21:49.578 --> 00:21:53.039]  The new trailer is up on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:21:53.419 --> 00:21:54.379]  Fabled Enemies.
[00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:58.261]  We're on the march.
[00:21:58.761 --> 00:22:00.342]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:22:01.282 --> 00:22:03.963]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:07.356 --> 00:22:09.378]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:22:09.498 --> 00:22:11.900]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.522]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:22:14.542 --> 00:22:15.763]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:22:15.783 --> 00:22:17.385]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:22:17.445 --> 00:22:20.307]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:22:20.347 --> 00:22:23.990]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:22:33.639 --> 00:22:38.904]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:22:39.785 --> 00:22:40.946]  An inside job?
[00:22:42.287 --> 00:22:43.348]  How dare you?
[00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:49.815]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:22:49.835 --> 00:22:52.597]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:22:52.737 --> 00:22:56.541]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th.
[00:22:57.918 --> 00:22:59.119]  Truth Rising.

[00:23:02.001 --> 00:23:04.002]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:23:04.263 --> 00:23:06.804]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:23:07.225 --> 00:23:10.307]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[00:23:10.667 --> 00:23:12.729]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[00:23:12.989 --> 00:23:15.991]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[00:23:16.271 --> 00:23:22.776]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[00:23:23.156 --> 00:23:25.278]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[00:23:25.758 --> 00:23:28.821]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[00:23:29.061 --> 00:23:33.705]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[00:23:33.846 --> 00:23:37.529]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[00:23:37.769 --> 00:23:39.311]  Travel less, meet online.
[00:23:39.391 --> 00:23:41.893]  Go to Webex.com and try Webex free.
[00:23:42.073 --> 00:23:44.395]  Just click the radiographic and enter promo code 500.
[00:23:45.436 --> 00:23:45.636]  Hi there.
[00:23:45.656 --> 00:23:47.017]  I want to talk to you about a dirty word.
[00:24:11.358 --> 00:24:12.178]  I know, I know.
[00:24:12.478 --> 00:24:15.659]  As the makers of drink and mate hangover defense tablets, we hear it every day.
[00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:18.901]  Grown, respectable adults don't get hangovers.
[00:24:19.281 --> 00:24:26.723]  Hangovers are what you got in college when you had about ten too many at the frat house and then rolled out of bed bright and early at the crack of noon the next day.
[00:24:27.163 --> 00:24:27.683]  These days?
[00:24:28.084 --> 00:24:34.226]  Well, sure, sometimes you'll have a couple drinks with dinner and sometimes you'll wake up with a little headache feeling just a bit queasy.
[00:24:34.506 --> 00:24:36.306]  But that's not really a hangover, is it?
[00:24:36.806 --> 00:24:38.227]  Well, call it what you want, but now
[00:24:42.218 --> 00:24:46.783]  Just pop one fizzy Drink and Mate tablet into a glass of water, just after you have a couple drinks.
[00:24:47.183 --> 00:24:51.808]  They taste great, and the patented guava leaf extract formula works while you sleep.
[00:24:52.188 --> 00:24:55.691]  So you wake up with no headache, no queasiness, no hangover.
[00:24:56.232 --> 00:24:58.314]  Look for the green box at retailers everywhere.
[00:24:58.634 --> 00:25:01.176]  For a location near you, visit drinkandmate.com.
[00:25:01.437 --> 00:25:02.798]  Drink and Mate Hangover Defense.
[00:25:03.118 --> 00:25:05.981]  It's how smart, responsible people like us avoid hangovers.
[00:25:18.547 --> 00:25:23.750]  The Fabled Enemies trailer is posted at the top of the page at InfoWars.com.
[00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:26.252]  It's not yet up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:25:26.972 --> 00:25:28.513]  Neocon's call for U.S.
[00:25:28.533 --> 00:25:32.576]  to launch war with Russia is also posted there.
[00:25:33.136 --> 00:25:36.158]  Today the New York Times reports that Russia is escalating its war with Georgia.
[00:25:36.578 --> 00:25:37.658]  What a deceptive headline.
[00:25:38.098 --> 00:25:48.642]  Moving tanks and troops to the separatist enclave of South Ossetia and advancing towards the city of Gori in central Georgia and even bombing parts of Tbilisi, the Georgian capital.
[00:25:49.102 --> 00:25:53.463]  Russia's increasing aggression is putting a spark into American neoconservatives today.
[00:25:53.864 --> 00:25:56.684]  They're always mad the Russians kicked out Trotsky, who was their founder.
[00:25:56.704 --> 00:25:57.725]  Yeah, a bunch of dirty commies.
[00:25:58.665 --> 00:26:03.046]  Russia's increasing aggression is putting a spark into American neoconservatives, that means communists.
[00:26:03.606 --> 00:26:11.628]  Today on the Times op-ed page, one of their leaders, William Crystal, founder of the communist movement, Fourth International, his father founded it, claims the U.S.
[00:26:11.688 --> 00:26:19.910]  must defend Georgia's sovereignty as a reward for its participation in Iraq, while the conservative Washington Times is calling for maximum pressure on Russia.
[00:26:21.297 --> 00:26:30.623]  Bill Kristol, again, son of the head of the Communist Fourth International, has had the third largest military presence, about 2,000 troops, fighting along U.S.
[00:26:30.663 --> 00:26:31.503]  soldiers and Marines.
[00:26:31.864 --> 00:26:34.845]  For this reason alone, we owe Georgia a serious effort to defend its sovereignty.
[00:26:35.286 --> 00:26:43.411]  Surely, we cannot simply stand by as an autocratic aggressor gobbles up part of, and perhaps destabilizes all of, a friendly democratic nation.
[00:26:44.051 --> 00:26:45.932]  What an incredible statement!
[00:26:45.952 --> 00:26:46.813]  We must strike!
[00:26:46.853 --> 00:26:47.413]  We must hit!
[00:26:48.114 --> 00:26:54.918]  And Cheney said that, I'll get you his actual quote, he said that there will be a serious response, there will be a response.
[00:26:55.239 --> 00:26:59.181]  Betrayus is flying C-130s full of Georgian troops up to the battle lines.
[00:26:59.221 --> 00:27:00.022]  This is insane!
[00:27:00.062 --> 00:27:01.042]  This could turn into World War III!
[00:27:02.023 --> 00:27:09.829]  Washington Times reports, it is the American interest to exert maximum pressure on Russia, withdraw its troops, and halt the interference from Georgian territory.
[00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:16.034]  The latest act shows the need for greater resolve in establishing a European security system that can be an effective check on Russian power.
[00:27:16.295 --> 00:27:25.222]  Kind of like when they went into the former Russian territory of Serbia, blew the daylights out of it, brought Muslims in, and then told the American people that Serbia attacked Albania.
[00:27:25.262 --> 00:27:26.203]  Just, it's unbelievable.
[00:27:26.883 --> 00:27:33.388]  Writing in the Washington Post today, Robert Kagan goes even further suggesting that the Georgian-Russian conflict may be the start of World War III.
[00:27:33.868 --> 00:27:34.989]  And he goes on to say that.
[00:27:35.369 --> 00:27:48.239]  I mean, I want to go back to Brendan and others that are patiently holding, but Lindsey Williams, they are all over TV, all over radio, all over the quote liberal media, all over everything, saying Russia started this.
[00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:51.181]  They have total contempt for the American people.
[00:27:51.221 --> 00:27:55.624]  They treat us like we are three-year-olds.
[00:27:56.701 --> 00:27:58.042]  Who've been beaten upside the head.
[00:27:59.263 --> 00:28:14.372]  But I guess that's what we are, because most people I talk to really think Russia, out of a clear day, just suddenly attacked for no reason last week, when it's admitted that U.S.-backed and Israeli-backed Georgian, with those troops involved.
[00:28:14.412 --> 00:28:18.194]  Our troops involved attacked and slaughtered and blew up a couple cities.
[00:28:18.794 --> 00:28:21.256]  I mean, this is incredible, Lindsey Williams.
[00:28:22.554 --> 00:28:25.557]  The elite make fortunes off of both sides of war.
[00:28:25.677 --> 00:28:32.963]  First World War, Second World War, what's happened in Iraq, what's going to happen in Iran, what's happening over in Georgia.
[00:28:33.223 --> 00:28:34.224]  They play both sides.
[00:28:34.504 --> 00:28:35.925]  They supply to both sides.
[00:28:36.486 --> 00:28:39.028]  And the elite are socialistic.
[00:28:39.048 --> 00:28:40.990]  You know, I lived with them for three years, Alex.
[00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:46.475]  This is the privilege that I had that the average person sits off and says, well, I think this, this, this, and this.
[00:28:46.775 --> 00:28:50.398]  I lived with these people for three years, analyzed them right on their own soil.
[00:28:50.916 --> 00:28:57.278]  They love conflicts like this, and the more they can get us into this, the more they're going to enjoy it and make fortunes off of it.
[00:28:58.679 --> 00:29:06.482]  Lindsey, in your educated opinion, do we have a hope and a prayer of de-escalating this, or do the elites just not give a you-know-what?
[00:29:08.022 --> 00:29:18.486]  Everything revolves around one subject and one subject only, and that is crude oil, and whoever it is that won't, that pipeline won't secrude oil out of Georgia,
[00:29:19.039 --> 00:29:22.242]  And once a natural gas out of Georgia, they're going to fight for it.
[00:29:22.562 --> 00:29:26.725]  Life means nothing because crude oil is the standard currency of the world.
[00:29:27.165 --> 00:29:36.373]  And in some way, connect in your mind and everything you see on the news about crude oil and natural gas in relation to Georgia and you'll know which way this thing is going.
[00:29:37.714 --> 00:29:38.774]  I have to agree with you.
[00:29:39.395 --> 00:29:41.296]  Very, very serious, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:41.437 --> 00:29:44.239]  Very, very serious.
[00:29:46.159 --> 00:29:48.020]  There's so much incredible news in the past.
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:50.461]  One story, like, confirmed U.S.
[00:29:50.501 --> 00:29:57.744]  mercenaries are being captured, one of them is an African American, in their leading troops attacking the Russians.
[00:29:57.784 --> 00:30:00.485]  This is an incredible provocation.
[00:30:00.845 --> 00:30:04.607]  Six months ago, three months ago, a month ago, the Russian Foreign Ministry
[00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:07.502]  Threatened to aim their nukes at the U.S.
[00:30:07.542 --> 00:30:15.789]  again and said, we will use nukes if you keep moving weapon systems into Ukraine, into Georgia, into Czech Republic, and they just don't care.
[00:30:16.309 --> 00:30:17.030]  They're doing it.
[00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:19.091]  Now, some people say the New World Order plays both sides.
[00:30:19.111 --> 00:30:22.634]  You're right, they do play both sides, but are they in control of both sides?
[00:30:23.075 --> 00:30:32.643]  We know, and it's been in the Financial Times of London, that every time they arrest one of the oligarchs, the ten or so that really owned Russia, that arrested like six of them, that they always then, once they're in jail,
[00:30:33.163 --> 00:30:38.047]  International agreements were already signed, where it's transferred to the Rothschilds, who were the secret owners.
[00:30:39.108 --> 00:30:42.291]  And yes, folks, that's really in the newspaper in England.
[00:30:43.372 --> 00:30:49.317]  So it also looks like Russia may actually be, at some level, a rogue element inside the New World Order.
[00:30:49.517 --> 00:30:52.900]  But you're saying your oil company source says no, they're teamed up with Russia.
[00:30:54.402 --> 00:30:57.685]  Well, yes, they've got to be, in order to produce.
[00:30:57.705 --> 00:30:59.166]  They know, they have known
[00:30:59.801 --> 00:31:00.882]  A long time in advance.
[00:31:00.982 --> 00:31:09.989]  Far enough in advance that the CEO of Exxon Mobil Oil Company on May the 3rd, 2008, said crude oil should be $50 a barrel.
[00:31:10.309 --> 00:31:10.949]  Now go look it up.
[00:31:10.989 --> 00:31:11.950]  You can find it on the web.
[00:31:12.290 --> 00:31:14.752]  It hit the national news May the 3rd of 2008.
[00:31:15.933 --> 00:31:25.500]  And for these oil company top people to make these statements, and then this man eight weeks ago to tell me exactly where these oil fields are that they were going to bring online,
[00:31:26.127 --> 00:31:46.054]  And for the retired CEO of Shell Oil to state on Monday, June the 2nd of 2008, America must have a new energy policy, but he wasn't talking about an energy policy of us developing our own oil fields, but an energy policy of developing the huge oil fields in Indonesia north of Russia, destroying the Arabs totally.
[00:31:46.534 --> 00:31:54.217]  And when people, if people can put all this together, Alex, they're going to see exactly what these people are doing, and every bit relates to
[00:31:55.537 --> 00:32:05.900]  All of these things are planned behind closed doors, and when this man said this to me eight weeks ago, he knew everything that they had talked about, all the plans that they had made.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:07.580]  Now, he did not mention Georgia.
[00:32:08.121 --> 00:32:16.903]  He did mention the fact that Russia is going to become one of the major powers on the face of the Earth, because they're going to become rich like the Arabs are right now.
[00:32:17.303 --> 00:32:20.804]  Then you put together that along with the socialism of Russia,
[00:32:21.326 --> 00:32:28.368]  And bring in the oil to give them the finances that they need to be able to do things that nobody ever thought that anybody could do.
[00:32:28.388 --> 00:32:35.530]  So Russia's been playing possum while the globalists brought down and bankrupted the U.S., which is what all the old-timers 50 years ago said the plan really was.
[00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:36.230]  And I want to be clear.
[00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:39.651]  Joseph McCarthy was an alcoholic.
[00:32:40.531 --> 00:32:48.654]  He thought he was, you know, he was a Marine who flew dangerous combat photography missions over Japan, and his plane got shot up quite a few times.
[00:32:48.714 --> 00:32:49.694]  He was the real deal.
[00:32:50.461 --> 00:32:53.143]  They make movies demonizing him, making him look like a fool.
[00:32:53.203 --> 00:32:54.004]  He wasn't perfect.
[00:32:54.044 --> 00:32:55.325]  He wasn't that sophisticated.
[00:32:56.386 --> 00:32:58.147]  But then he found out about the New World Order.
[00:32:58.167 --> 00:32:59.689]  I've talked to people that knew him and worked with him.
[00:33:00.469 --> 00:33:03.151]  They were allowing him to set up a police state in the U.S.
[00:33:03.171 --> 00:33:08.035]  in the name of fighting communism to really persecute the left and create censorship boards for the FBI.
[00:33:08.636 --> 00:33:13.700]  But as soon as he found out and said, the Army, the Air Force, everybody works for the Communists.
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:15.922]  He goes, no wait, they're funding the Communists.
[00:33:15.962 --> 00:33:16.943]  And as soon as he found out,
[00:33:17.643 --> 00:33:21.664]  That they had put Mao Tse-tung into power, which is now declassified in mainstream history.
[00:33:22.064 --> 00:33:23.084]  Our government put Mao in.
[00:33:24.064 --> 00:33:31.806]  They set them up after the Boxer Rebellion 110 years ago, and then had them fight the Japanese, and then didn't give Chiang Kai-shek the weapons.
[00:33:32.226 --> 00:33:33.826]  The point is, it turned out he was right.
[00:33:34.126 --> 00:33:36.507]  But it wasn't communism, it was globalism.
[00:33:36.987 --> 00:33:43.948]  Just as Carol Quigley at Georgetown said, Bill Clinton's mentor, the head of political science there, that the international roundtable groups based in London
[00:33:45.329 --> 00:33:55.577]  Use and own all the groups and finance them all, but they like to work with communists and fascists because they centralize control, which they can then create a global government with.
[00:33:56.257 --> 00:33:58.018]  And so, that's what's happening.
[00:33:58.038 --> 00:34:10.048]  And as soon as McCarthy found out that the military was, quote, backing the communists, which later all came out, giving them nukes, weapons, aluminum plants, everything, that's when they had to shut him down and made him look like a fool.
[00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:13.550]  Now, let's go back to Brendan in Australia.
[00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:14.271]  Finish up, Brendan.
[00:34:15.292 --> 00:34:24.421]  Yeah, I was just going to say, today, Kevin Rudd, the Prime Minister of Australia, went to Korea, and they've got like a big story about how he's talking about Australian beef and whatnot.
[00:34:24.761 --> 00:34:28.785]  And then, you know, most of the media just left it out, but a few of them are starting to pick it up.
[00:34:29.566 --> 00:34:33.370]  Also, the main reason he went there was to push his Asia-Pacific community.
[00:34:34.133 --> 00:34:59.049]  The Asian Pacific Union, which is... And when you read it, they call it a union, just like the African Union, the Caribbean Union they're trying to set up, the South American Union was signed five weeks ago, the African Union's been around for ten years, and then major news publications wrote articles in the last two weeks, several of them saying, I'm insane that the African Union doesn't exist.
[00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:03.172]  They're living in a delusional la-la land.
[00:35:03.792 --> 00:35:05.312]  I mean, it's all over the foreign press.
[00:35:05.332 --> 00:35:06.052]  They're having meetings.
[00:35:06.072 --> 00:35:10.173]  They have international bodies that are set up.
[00:35:10.213 --> 00:35:11.834]  They have the African Union set up.
[00:35:12.334 --> 00:35:13.754]  And the media says it doesn't exist.
[00:35:15.975 --> 00:35:20.535]  Even now, even the news is saying it's going to be like a European Union style community.
[00:35:20.595 --> 00:35:21.456]  They call it a community.
[00:35:21.476 --> 00:35:23.416]  Yeah, but you're allowed to see that in Australia.
[00:35:23.836 --> 00:35:26.057]  They know Americans are so dumb.
[00:35:26.117 --> 00:35:29.837]  I mean, everybody's been dumbed down in the West, but we're the winners.
[00:35:29.917 --> 00:35:32.338]  I mean, we win by several lengths.
[00:35:32.918 --> 00:35:34.539]  You know, it's not winning by a nose.
[00:35:34.599 --> 00:35:38.562]  I mean, it's just... I mean, I'm not being mean here.
[00:35:38.602 --> 00:35:39.142]  It's a fact.
[00:35:39.482 --> 00:35:43.005]  It's literally... None of it exists!
[00:35:43.045 --> 00:35:44.526]  Government's always good!
[00:35:44.906 --> 00:35:46.107]  There's no elite!
[00:35:46.447 --> 00:35:48.068]  There's no... I mean, I don't...
[00:35:48.328 --> 00:35:49.209]  Thank you for the call, sir.
[00:35:50.069 --> 00:35:50.650]  Absolutely.
[00:35:51.510 --> 00:36:07.082]  They said a year ago, because I was finishing Endgame at the time, I've got the mainstream articles in the film, they said that they were now making the Asian economic group, what is it, APEC, similar to AIPAC, not the same thing, that it was now a union.
[00:36:08.106 --> 00:36:09.167]  Oh, you're exactly right, Alex.
[00:36:09.227 --> 00:36:18.735]  In fact, everything that you've been saying over these years, and even though I don't get to talk to you that much in person, I follow you very carefully.
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:48.870]  These elitists have everything planned in advance, and when this gentleman called me eight weeks ago and told me these things were going to happen, I was utterly flabbergasted to hear the things that they have already on the drawing board, and all of this fits together.
[00:36:49.151 --> 00:36:52.513]  Understand one thing, everybody out there in Alex's listening audience.
[00:36:52.873 --> 00:36:54.955]  The elite control the world.
[00:36:55.075 --> 00:36:56.856]  They control both sides.
[00:36:57.273 --> 00:36:59.836]  They control what's happening over there in Iraq.
[00:36:59.876 --> 00:37:00.898]  They control Iran.
[00:37:00.938 --> 00:37:02.259]  They control Russia.
[00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:04.222]  They control what's happening in America.
[00:37:04.622 --> 00:37:06.124]  And the elite pull the strings.
[00:37:06.224 --> 00:37:09.789]  Everybody in Congress immediately says, how do you want us to jump?
[00:37:09.849 --> 00:37:10.850]  Whenever they say jump.
[00:37:11.577 --> 00:37:12.838]  And the President does too.
[00:37:34.759 --> 00:37:38.481]  Yeah, Alex, I just wanted to say, I mean, Billy Crystal's such a scumbag.
[00:37:38.521 --> 00:37:40.963]  I mean, the guy's like a little warlord every time you see him.
[00:37:41.043 --> 00:37:44.344]  I honestly don't even think people take the guy seriously anymore.
[00:37:44.464 --> 00:37:44.825]  Oh, really?
[00:37:44.865 --> 00:37:45.985]  They're attacking Russia right now?
[00:37:47.146 --> 00:37:47.506]  They are.
[00:37:47.546 --> 00:37:48.347]  You're right about that.
[00:37:48.707 --> 00:37:50.668]  He's anything but a conservative.
[00:37:51.308 --> 00:37:53.950]  Well, I mean, he's a Trotskyite, so that's the new conservative.
[00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:58.772]  Well, I wanted to ask, Lindsey, how do you see this for the United States playing out?
[00:37:58.812 --> 00:38:01.614]  I mean, how much do you think we're going to escalate this?
[00:38:02.521 --> 00:38:03.622]  I don't know.
[00:38:16.201 --> 00:38:22.662]  In Ezekiel chapter 38 and 39, you put these nations together and you've got World War III if it goes to that point.
[00:38:22.682 --> 00:38:23.182]  Okay, you know what?
[00:38:23.603 --> 00:38:24.443]  That's a great point, John.
[00:38:24.503 --> 00:38:28.864]  Briefly, and I'll just keep you to the end of the show, but I've got a few things I've got to plug, and I also want to plug your stuff.
[00:38:28.884 --> 00:38:43.707]  Lindsay Williams, briefly, as a Baptist minister, looking at your perspective on the Scriptures, and I'm going from memory here, but doesn't the Antichrist blow the daylights out of a Russian group, and then later the Russians and the Chinese come back?
[00:38:44.267 --> 00:38:45.647]  Or fill me in briefly on that.
[00:38:46.564 --> 00:38:47.444]  You're exactly right.
[00:38:47.584 --> 00:38:51.266]  He literally decimates certain parts of the world.
[00:38:51.406 --> 00:38:53.687]  Russia will eventually be destroyed.
[00:38:55.067 --> 00:38:58.489]  China, oh my goodness, China's got some exciting days ahead.
[00:38:58.849 --> 00:39:02.530]  The United States of America is going to really take a backseat.
[00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:09.613]  We are going to become a nil, how should I put it, a nil circumstance in the world.
[00:39:09.693 --> 00:39:12.054]  A third world kind of backwater cesspit.
[00:39:12.815 --> 00:39:16.296]  Yeah, we are going to take a backseat from this point on, any way you look at it.
[00:39:17.875 --> 00:39:20.017]  Because we've been neutralized, sucked dry by the bankers.
[00:39:20.357 --> 00:39:21.158]  Anything else, Sean?
[00:39:22.018 --> 00:39:24.861]  Historically, gold and oil have always gone together.
[00:39:24.981 --> 00:39:27.483]  I do not think that's going to continue.
[00:39:27.503 --> 00:39:28.163]  Now, this is only a prediction.
[00:39:28.183 --> 00:39:29.184]  I agree with you, Alex.
[00:39:41.505 --> 00:39:45.166]  I've got to call this man back and ask him some more questions if he's willing to answer me.
[00:39:45.906 --> 00:39:53.168]  It's my opinion... If you have a devaluing dollar, it doesn't matter what oil does, the gold's going to go up because it's denominated in dollars.
[00:39:54.248 --> 00:39:56.509]  Yeah, I think oil and gold are going to break.
[00:39:56.709 --> 00:39:59.149]  I do not think they're going to stay together as they've done in the past.
[00:39:59.209 --> 00:40:00.190]  I think they're going to break.
[00:40:00.650 --> 00:40:06.971]  I was just in touch this morning with a gold dealer who had talked with the United States Mint.
[00:40:07.031 --> 00:40:09.072]  He literally was on the phone with them this morning.
[00:40:09.608 --> 00:40:18.053]  Yeah, I just wanted to mention, I remember back on the first Alex, it was like the Friday after Lindsay first came on, that she had mentioned, I believe, Bob Chapman was on with you.
[00:40:38.837 --> 00:40:43.280]  Well, I just said, like I said earlier, the globalists, you never know what they're going to do.
[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:43.960]  This could be a curveball.
[00:40:59.631 --> 00:41:03.992]  It would normally take about one to two years to get a refinery up and going over there to introduce them.
[00:41:04.352 --> 00:41:05.232]  That's what we said, yeah.
[00:41:05.472 --> 00:41:06.132]  Yeah.
[00:41:06.332 --> 00:41:12.054]  Is that actually the case, Lindsey, or would they already have something in place, or what do you see about that?
[00:41:12.854 --> 00:41:19.735]  One of the first things that came to my mind after I talked with this man eight weeks ago was he is trying to literally make me look like a fool.
[00:41:20.195 --> 00:41:23.136]  He is trying to totally discredit everything I've done for the past 35 years.
[00:41:24.218 --> 00:41:26.180]  Hey Alex, you've got some great guests on lately.
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:27.821]  Hey, I've got a question for each of you.
[00:41:27.841 --> 00:41:29.622]  First of all, I was in the Coast Guard on September 11th.
[00:41:50.305 --> 00:41:54.486]  You mentioned quite a few times that the FBI had been out there spreading disinfo.
[00:41:55.106 --> 00:42:03.088]  And on that day, because of my position, I was handed probably about a stack of 20 pages of Middle Eastern men and women's names.
[00:42:03.928 --> 00:42:10.829]  And it just seems to me that it should have been in a marked envelope, either classified or secret.
[00:42:12.089 --> 00:42:16.710]  So my question for you is, do you believe that that should have been marked?
[00:42:17.191 --> 00:42:19.071]  I've talked to a lot of troops that I know.
[00:42:20.825 --> 00:42:22.566]  Yeah, everything that you've said about 9-11 is true Alex.
[00:42:48.297 --> 00:42:50.639]  That gives you an idea of how reckless this New World Order crowd is.
[00:42:50.699 --> 00:42:51.480]  Anything else, Cody?
[00:42:52.121 --> 00:42:55.063]  I'm going to jam you in, Cody and Jennifer.
[00:42:55.123 --> 00:42:55.864]  Sorry to Jeremy.
[00:42:56.144 --> 00:42:59.247]  I'll have time for two more calls and Lindsey Williams on the other side.
[00:42:59.327 --> 00:43:04.412]  My new film, well, I produced it, Burmiss directed it, is coming out in a few weeks.
[00:43:04.732 --> 00:43:06.474]  The trailer is on InfoWars.com.
[00:43:06.514 --> 00:43:07.155]  It's Fabled Enemies.
[00:43:07.595 --> 00:43:17.243]  Since the year 2000, earthquakes, heat waves, droughts, tsunamis, floods, fires, and hurricanes have killed over 1 million people worldwide and forced tens of millions to go without food and water.
[00:43:17.423 --> 00:43:21.466]  After Katrina, the media was eager to show victims in New Orleans begging for food.
[00:43:21.606 --> 00:43:24.729]  If a disaster strikes you and your loved ones and you have no stored food,
[00:43:25.029 --> 00:43:26.310]  You'll be begging as well.
[00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:32.614]  Now our economy is slipping into an abyss that even Donald Trump says will make the Great Depression look like a Sunday picnic.
[00:43:32.734 --> 00:43:33.135]  The U.S.
[00:43:33.195 --> 00:43:35.857]  dollar is worth less today than it was even last week.
[00:43:36.077 --> 00:43:39.919]  Before food prices skyrocket, trucks stop running and stores close their doors.
[00:43:40.039 --> 00:43:42.121]  Survival Enterprises can help you prepare.
[00:43:42.381 --> 00:43:47.065]  They're master distributors of Mountain House freeze-dried food with up to a 50-year shelf life.

[00:46:20.179 --> 00:46:21.521]  I want to thank our guests for joining us.
[00:46:21.541 --> 00:46:26.787]  Before we go back to him, you need to remember, ladies and gentlemen, that this broadcast is made possible
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:39.565]  By our sponsors, and one of them is eFoodsDirect, eFoodsDirect.com, it's the J. Michael Stevens Group, the longest continually operating storable foods company in the nation.

[00:46:52.772 --> 00:46:53.513]  Wonderful folks.
[00:46:53.533 --> 00:46:55.255]  Give them a call.
[00:46:55.876 --> 00:46:59.841]  Get the free CD as well.

[00:47:57.729 --> 00:47:59.250]  That means your order will go out first.
[00:48:00.236 --> 00:48:02.117]  Maybe even a few days before September 1st.
[00:48:02.157 --> 00:48:05.459]  We have a way of sneaking the DVDs out early for people that order first.
[00:48:05.759 --> 00:48:07.600]  That's just a few weeks away, Fabled Enemies.
[00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:12.502]  The trailer is up on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:48:12.562 --> 00:48:17.145]  It'll be up by the end of the day on PrisonPlanet.tv for a members version in super high quality.
[00:48:17.505 --> 00:48:20.747]  I just want to put it out for everybody in members quality so they get a view of what it looks like.
[00:48:20.927 --> 00:48:24.789]  Okay, very quickly, Cody in Arizona, Coast Guard, go ahead and finish your point.
[00:48:25.621 --> 00:48:40.706]  Yeah, Lindsey, I just have some friends that moved up to Wyoming to work in the oil fields, and I'm curious if you're aware of any foreign interests up in that area, you know, Russian or any other countries that might be involved.
[00:48:41.787 --> 00:48:48.649]  Russia would not need to have an interest in it at all, because they have just had discovered in the northern part of Russia this huge oil field.
[00:48:49.122 --> 00:48:52.004]  It has such major amounts and it's almost unbelievable.
[00:48:52.104 --> 00:48:54.525]  And see, none of that affects Americans.
[00:48:54.765 --> 00:48:56.246]  None of this affects the U.S.
[00:48:56.286 --> 00:48:59.468]  If they allow more oil out of Alaska, it's just going to be given to Asia.
[00:48:59.608 --> 00:49:01.389]  We are known as the dumb cows.
[00:49:01.790 --> 00:49:03.390]  We are known as the people to be abused.
[00:49:03.831 --> 00:49:04.171]  Okay?
[00:49:04.191 --> 00:49:05.892]  So we don't get any of our oil anyways.
[00:49:06.652 --> 00:49:07.253]  Very little of it.
[00:49:07.533 --> 00:49:08.373]  Thank you, Cody.
[00:49:08.634 --> 00:49:10.214]  Jennifer in Tennessee, last caller.
[00:49:12.856 --> 00:49:13.256]  Are you there?
[00:49:13.416 --> 00:49:14.157]  Yes, I am, Jennifer.
[00:49:14.918 --> 00:49:16.780]  Okay, I have a question for Lindsey.
[00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:27.411]  Last time you were on Alex's show, you had mentioned that you thought by the end of the summer that gas would go up $1 a gallon before it reached $50 a barrel, but since you were on... I don't believe you.
[00:49:27.451 --> 00:49:28.492]  I don't remember him saying that.
[00:49:28.632 --> 00:49:30.054]  I think he said it was going to start dropping then.
[00:49:30.074 --> 00:49:35.900]  Well, I thought I heard him say that he thought that gas would go up $1 a gallon before it reached $50 a barrel.
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:36.881]  Lindsey, did you say that?
[00:49:38.007 --> 00:49:44.871]  If the individual that talked with me eight weeks ago, he said that the price of gasoline will probably go up a little higher before it drops.
[00:49:45.331 --> 00:50:03.382]  Now, if you'd like to know everything that I was told by one of the people who knows all that's happening behind closed doors, a man that is as close to the elitist as I probably have ever known, please, I beg of you to get my analysis of what he said as well as everything he said on a DVD
[00:50:04.469 --> 00:50:05.510]  And a CD.
[00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:07.912]  Please dial this number.
[00:50:07.932 --> 00:50:08.893]  800-321-2900.
[00:50:09.093 --> 00:50:14.918]  The title of it is The Next 12 Months.
[00:50:14.938 --> 00:50:15.258]  800-321-2900.
[00:50:15.318 --> 00:50:22.043]  Lindsey, we're going to have to have you back up later this week if we can do it.
[00:50:22.083 --> 00:50:23.164]  We are flat out of time.
[00:50:23.184 --> 00:50:24.646]  Thank you for spending time with us today.
[00:50:25.366 --> 00:50:26.047]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:50:26.107 --> 00:50:28.349]  And folks, listen to everything Alex has to say.
[00:50:28.369 --> 00:50:29.830]  He's giving it to you day after day.
[00:50:29.850 --> 00:50:31.131]  Don't miss a single broadcast.
[00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:32.611]  Thank you, Lindsay Williams.
[00:50:32.631 --> 00:50:33.611]  God bless and take care.
[00:50:34.032 --> 00:50:36.714]  Rebroadcast with Michelle Chosodosky, the professor.
[00:50:37.894 --> 00:50:40.596]  We also had on a lot of other great folks today.
[00:50:42.157 --> 00:50:45.120]  Amy Allen, and of course, that interview you just heard.
[00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:47.321]  At InfoWars.com, retransmission is now.
