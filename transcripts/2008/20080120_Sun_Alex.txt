[00:00:11.548 --> 00:00:12.889]  He stands for truth.
[00:00:14.311 --> 00:00:16.172]  He stands for justice.
[00:00:17.513 --> 00:00:19.135]  He stands for what's right.
[00:00:19.935 --> 00:00:22.297]  This is the Alex Jones Show.

[00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.763]  Now live from Austin, Texas.
[00:00:34.833 --> 00:00:35.893]  Here's Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.615 --> 00:00:41.496]  Yes, my friends, we are live.
[00:00:41.596 --> 00:00:43.957]  It is Sunday, the 20th day of January 2008.
[00:00:44.037 --> 00:00:48.018]  We'll be here live for the next two hours.
[00:00:48.058 --> 00:00:49.739]  We're going to have wide open phones.
[00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:50.419]  No guests today.
[00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:52.080]  A lot of your calls at 877-590-5525.
[00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.280]  877-590-5525.
[00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.121]  On stations from San Diego to Northern
[00:01:02.074 --> 00:01:12.940]  New York, down to Florida, to right here in Austin, Texas on NewsRadio 590K LBJ, the studios we come to you from locally in Texas, in the area, it's 836-0590.
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.441]  Here is the news I have in front of me.
[00:01:15.561 --> 00:01:29.268]  Seeking tools to calm the market, the New York Times, the establishment media is finally getting around to admitting that we're in a deep, deep recession that could gyrate into a massive currency collapse and total depression.
[00:01:29.932 --> 00:01:31.913]  And they're talking about the stock market going down to 6,000.
[00:01:32.414 --> 00:01:42.300]  Now, of course, those of you that understand inflation know that at 2,000 numbers, the stock market is below 6,000 in actual dollar value today.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.143]  So they're talking about a stock market at 3,000 points the year 2000 level.
[00:01:49.824 --> 00:01:55.648]  Also, overseas investors are aggressively buying up the infrastructure and companies in the United States.
[00:01:55.728 --> 00:02:00.412]  The fire sale, we are now a third world nation, in case no one got around to telling you about it.
[00:02:01.761 --> 00:02:06.867]  Also, directly from the Council on Foreign Relations website, the organization sworn to destroy U.S.
[00:02:06.887 --> 00:02:15.938]  sovereignty, CFR, the historical anomaly of the dollar, they're going to talk about a world currency directly from them.
[00:02:16.418 --> 00:02:17.479]  So we'll be breaking that down.
[00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:21.384]  Also, Mexico is already interfering in the politics and internal workings.
[00:02:21.804 --> 00:02:22.264]  We're good to go.
[00:02:49.114 --> 00:02:51.257]  And it wasn't just somebody joking around on the radio.
[00:02:51.357 --> 00:02:52.758]  It was a staged event.
[00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:56.362]  And even mainstream media is now reporting that.
[00:02:56.382 --> 00:02:57.143]  See, that's the good news.
[00:02:57.163 --> 00:02:58.825]  They don't get away with this stuff most of the time.
[00:02:59.205 --> 00:03:05.312]  Now when they stage terror attacks or stage provocations, even the mainstream media has to report on it because it comes out.
[00:03:05.633 --> 00:03:07.715]  We know your tricks, but like an old dog,
[00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:10.836]  They just keep bringing out the same trick over and over again.
[00:03:11.217 --> 00:03:16.760]  Earlier in the week I talked about this on my weekday syndicated transmission, but I thought I'd talk about it again today.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:25.546]  Fox News, foreign television, BBC, as well as British papers are reporting that there are secret armies of Al-Qaeda all over the West.
[00:03:27.053 --> 00:03:30.915]  1,400 strong, they're blonde-haired, blue-eyed, and it says, watch all white people.
[00:03:31.015 --> 00:03:40.500]  See, first they create the false pretext of terrorism, Al-Cieda, then they get you looking under every rock and under your bed at night and in the closet for Al-Qaeda, you slip and fall.
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:46.262]  Al-Qaeda did it, kind of like Jack Frost, secretly frosting the grass and the trees in the morning.
[00:03:46.983 --> 00:03:51.525]  It's mythological, but for a dumbed-down public, it works like a charm.
[00:03:51.565 --> 00:03:55.947]  The new Al-Qaeda, quote, blonde-haired, blue-eyed, they're everywhere under Al-Qaeda's
[00:03:56.482 --> 00:03:57.223]  Control.
[00:03:58.444 --> 00:04:02.847]  So we'll be going over that, and talking about politics, Decision 2008.
[00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.032]  I have a nice screenshot up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:09.172 --> 00:04:20.941]  We omit, you decide, by the ultra-liberal, neo-con, fake conservative, Judas Goat, Judas Iscariot, sort of neutralized conservatives, fool them until it's too late, and bring in the new world order.
[00:04:21.576 --> 00:04:26.699]  Ron Paul won second place in Nevada.
[00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:29.941]  What did Fox News, CNN, and a bunch of others do?
[00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:36.985]  We actually watched some of the coverage this weekend when I was up in Dallas on a shoot working on a new film on the JFK assassination.
[00:04:37.545 --> 00:04:48.611]  I was up there and so at night we'd watch and I'd read the papers and nowhere heard except if you actually went to the returns that Ron Paul had even gotten second place.
[00:04:48.671 --> 00:04:50.232]  It was all Mitt Romney,
[00:04:50.928 --> 00:04:52.289]  First place, John McCain.
[00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:53.871]  Second place, Mike Huckabee.
[00:04:54.271 --> 00:04:54.791]  Third place.
[00:04:55.352 --> 00:05:00.436]  Now, it's true that Ron Paul tied McCain for second place, but they just omitted him.
[00:05:01.177 --> 00:05:03.399]  They just didn't even show him.
[00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:07.822]  They just showed Mitt Romney, John McCain, and Mike Huckabee side-by-side.
[00:05:08.303 --> 00:05:09.524]  And they did that everywhere else.
[00:05:09.564 --> 00:05:18.111]  But you better believe, when he had a weak showing in South Carolina, a four-point, still better than Giuliani, who they keep cramming down your throat, Giuliani,
[00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:21.291]  Just, oh my gosh, Paul on a dropout.
[00:05:21.652 --> 00:05:24.594]  He's not doing well, only four percentage points.
[00:05:26.055 --> 00:05:29.318]  I mean, if they give Ron Paul one-tenth the coverage, they give Giuliani.
[00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:33.882]  He was still getting more coverage than anybody but Hillary, because he is the establishment candidate.
[00:05:34.102 --> 00:05:39.827]  And they're telling us that John McCain is the Republican for the job, the only electable Republican.
[00:05:39.907 --> 00:05:40.568]  Oh, he's so great.
[00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.432]  Did you know that he's mafia connected and his wife is?
[00:05:44.492 --> 00:05:45.874]  And that's even been in major papers.
[00:05:46.394 --> 00:05:50.237]  Did you know that he was part of the Keating Five in savings and loan swindles?
[00:05:50.257 --> 00:05:51.398]  They all went to prison, he didn't.
[00:05:51.718 --> 00:05:52.739]  He was the Keating Six.
[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:53.880]  The Six Man.
[00:05:54.581 --> 00:05:57.163]  So they call him Anti-Corruption Mr. Clean McCain.
[00:05:57.804 --> 00:05:59.525]  Knowing that the public is ignorant.
[00:06:01.881 --> 00:06:05.604]  Knowing that the public is unaware of his history.
[00:06:06.084 --> 00:06:09.727]  It doesn't matter if I've interviewed people who were in the Hanoi Hilton for a few days with him.
[00:06:10.047 --> 00:06:13.250]  He agreed to turn over all the secrets on the fleet and the jets and the rest of it.
[00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.151]  So they took him to a lavish facility.
[00:06:16.693 --> 00:06:18.374]  I mean, McCain is anti-gun.
[00:06:18.394 --> 00:06:19.935]  He's called for gun bans.
[00:06:20.195 --> 00:06:24.679]  He's for total blanket open borders and total North American Union merger amnesty.
[00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:29.843]  I mean, he couldn't be more unconservative, un-libertarian, anti-freedom.
[00:06:30.413 --> 00:06:31.093]  But does it matter?
[00:06:31.413 --> 00:06:33.174]  Hillary, McCain, none of them.
[00:06:33.214 --> 00:06:35.655]  They're all bought and paid for by the same globalist interests.
[00:06:36.075 --> 00:06:37.876]  If you don't vote for Paul, vote for none of them.
[00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:51.842]  How about you just focus locally where you could actually have an effect, and we focus, we have over 50% turnout for national and presidential races, the big horse races, but then we have 8% at the county and city level on average in the country.
[00:06:51.862 --> 00:06:54.803]  I know that's about 8.2 here in Austin, where I live.
[00:06:55.762 --> 00:06:57.043]  That's where the real power is.
[00:06:57.063 --> 00:07:01.666]  That's where the real action, that's where the feds come in and federalize you is happening.
[00:07:01.726 --> 00:07:04.608]  That's where we need to focus most of our energies.
[00:07:05.888 --> 00:07:07.849]  By the way, some people are saying, well, Ron Paul's out of it.
[00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.211]  Well, I mean, why is Giuliani still in it?
[00:07:11.251 --> 00:07:13.813]  He keeps beating Giuliani in every primary.
[00:07:15.496 --> 00:07:17.637]  Bottom line, we've already won in the Ron Paul Revolution.
[00:07:18.317 --> 00:07:27.759]  Masses of people, tens of millions, are talking about the private Federal Reserve, the New World Order, the North American Union, the inflation tax on our money.
[00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:30.780]  Either way, we're standing up, we're fighting.
[00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:37.001]  More people are awake to the globalists and the international financial interests that control our country.
[00:07:37.634 --> 00:07:40.015]  Like a puppeteer controls his marionette.
[00:07:40.515 --> 00:07:41.396]  And that's the good news.
[00:07:41.416 --> 00:07:42.496]  This is a process.
[00:07:42.536 --> 00:07:44.197]  This isn't going to be won overnight.
[00:07:44.217 --> 00:07:45.678]  And I'm glad Ron Paul's still in the race.
[00:07:45.718 --> 00:07:46.518]  And who knows?
[00:07:47.519 --> 00:07:48.959]  He might run for a third party.
[00:07:48.979 --> 00:07:50.480]  You know, he isn't ruling that out now.
[00:07:51.187 --> 00:07:53.368]  And so we'll see what happens there.
[00:07:53.388 --> 00:07:56.670]  At least real ideas will be injected into this debate.
[00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:59.071]  When we get back from break, we're going to open up the phones.
[00:07:59.111 --> 00:08:01.032]  Again, the toll-free number is 877-590-5525.
[00:08:02.113 --> 00:08:16.580]  And then after we take some calls at the bottom of the hour after news, I'm going to get into the economy and talk about the supposed fixes that the Republicans and Democrats in a bipartisan package
[00:08:17.639 --> 00:08:31.407]  According to Chuckie Schumer, Mr. Ban All Guns in the Senate, and George Bush, his good buddy, we're going to break down the fact that it is not a solution, and they're not even discussing the real root cause of the problem.
[00:08:32.227 --> 00:08:38.170]  And then we'll get into Mexico interfering in the internal operations of the United States.
[00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:39.791]  This is called espionage.
[00:08:40.992 --> 00:08:44.854]  This is called getting involved in the internal affairs of another country.
[00:08:45.801 --> 00:08:48.502]  This is what the United States has done to other third world nations.
[00:08:48.943 --> 00:08:51.244]  That's how pathetic we've gotten.
[00:08:52.004 --> 00:08:55.026]  And again, I love this country, but we're not going to save it.
[00:08:55.966 --> 00:09:05.230]  We're not going to save the country unless we start admitting just how serious and just how deep the real problems are.
[00:09:05.651 --> 00:09:12.434]  So I would also ask the listeners, what do you think of Mexico saying that they're going to run TV ads during the election this year?
[00:09:13.337 --> 00:09:30.203]  In 2008, they're going to run non-stop TV ads, radio ads, print ads, all over the United States saying, legalize the illegals, let hundreds of millions of Latin Americans, foreign unabated, of course didn't get all the free health care, have their births all paid for, further bankrupt the nation.
[00:09:30.963 --> 00:09:37.866]  But you know, I think the country is going to completely, financially collapse long before they get all this done, and the pressures will be so great,
[00:09:38.793 --> 00:09:41.935]  Uh, that, uh, the illegal aliens are gonna have to go home, a lot of them.
[00:09:42.236 --> 00:09:52.023]  That's why the establishment's rushing to get Amnesty Now to flood the nation with as many as they can before the New World Order destroys the United States once and for all.
[00:09:52.403 --> 00:09:54.264]  And believe me, we're in the crosshairs.
[00:09:54.544 --> 00:09:55.325]  It's happening now.
[00:09:55.425 --> 00:09:56.046]  We'll be right back.
[00:09:56.626 --> 00:09:57.387]  It is a big idea.
[00:09:57.407 --> 00:09:58.567]  A New World Order.
[00:09:58.747 --> 00:09:59.608]  In the near future.
[00:10:15.887 --> 00:10:18.328]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:10:19.069 --> 00:10:26.473]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:10:29.414 --> 00:10:34.357]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:10:34.877 --> 00:10:38.319]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:10:38.719 --> 00:10:41.221]  Bill of Rights makes great progress for the world government.
[00:10:41.281 --> 00:10:42.441]  Most people have no idea.
[00:10:42.461 --> 00:10:43.222]  They're not after money.
[00:10:43.242 --> 00:10:44.303]  They have all the money they need.
[00:10:44.523 --> 00:10:45.243]  They're after power.
[00:10:45.283 --> 00:10:46.624]  That's what they're after, isn't it?
[00:10:46.644 --> 00:10:54.848]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:10:54.969 --> 00:10:57.750]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:10:58.170 --> 00:10:59.211]  You have been warned.
[00:11:00.211 --> 00:11:01.191]  Ted Anders from Midas.
[00:11:01.211 --> 00:11:01.591]  January 18, 2008.
[00:11:01.671 --> 00:11:02.592]  Gold, 880.80.
[00:11:02.632 --> 00:11:09.613]  Old school coins can be purchased for 906.58, 446.60 per half, 223.30 per quarter.
[00:11:09.793 --> 00:11:12.234]  That's 906.58, 446.60, and 223.30.
[00:11:13.734 --> 00:11:17.015]  For years, Ron Paul has taken the position to uphold constitutional rights.
[00:11:17.315 --> 00:11:21.496]  He's been branded by special interest groups as doctrinal, refusing to bend his values.
[00:11:21.896 --> 00:11:25.858]  I can only imagine the pressure applied by Congress as he stands alone for these principles.
[00:11:26.258 --> 00:11:28.079]  He has given up a medical career for this.
[00:11:28.579 --> 00:11:30.300]  Ron Paul is running for President.
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:36.543]  The ideas of strong currency, ending the war, defending the Constitution, and protecting civil liberties are catching on.
[00:11:36.803 --> 00:11:43.586]  As a thank you, GCNlive.com, Midas Resources, and I would like to send you a free copy of the Ron Paul Family Cookbook.

[00:11:51.271 --> 00:11:54.354]  I hope his values are touching your heart as deep as they are mine.
[00:11:54.494 --> 00:11:54.814]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:11:54.874 --> 00:11:56.336]  Thanks again for supporting Ron Paul.

[00:12:53.617 --> 00:12:54.018]  Hi, neighbor.
[00:13:03.766 --> 00:13:05.488]  We all know that knowledge is power.
[00:13:05.908 --> 00:13:09.011]  We've tried to give you knowledge to help you prepare for rough times.
[00:13:09.612 --> 00:13:14.297]  There's the worldwide famine and our country's dependence on often dangerous food imports.
[00:13:14.937 --> 00:13:16.919]  You know about genetically poisoned food.
[00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:23.065]  Two-thirds of the food is disappearing with the bees along with huge crop failures from all-time record water shortages.
[00:13:23.766 --> 00:13:27.430]  You know they're turning food into fuel with corn ethanol plants.
[00:13:28.363 --> 00:13:32.084]  If we do not control our food, food will be used to control us.
[00:13:32.604 --> 00:13:37.746]  Food control has been the plan historically in every enslaved population and is the plan for America.
[00:13:38.426 --> 00:13:46.688]  The only value of the knowledge you have to take control of your food is if you choose to get a supply while you still have the freedom to choose.
[00:13:47.148 --> 00:13:48.409]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[00:13:48.429 --> 00:13:48.729]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:14:04.727 --> 00:14:08.771]  You're listening to GPM, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:14:08.851 --> 00:14:12.875]  Alright, my friends, we are back live again.
[00:14:12.935 --> 00:14:14.397]  It's the 20th day of January 2008.
[00:14:14.577 --> 00:14:15.938]  Hope you're able to join us.
[00:14:15.959 --> 00:14:15.999]  877-590-5525.
[00:14:28.917 --> 00:14:32.899]  Let's go ahead and go to some of your phone calls and all the financial news coming up in the next segment.
[00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.881]  Let's talk to Matt Listing in Boston.
[00:14:36.281 --> 00:14:37.181]  Matt, you're on the air.
[00:14:37.262 --> 00:14:37.622]  Welcome.
[00:14:37.662 --> 00:14:38.642]  Hi, Alex.
[00:14:38.682 --> 00:14:39.423]  Nice to talk to you again.
[00:14:39.443 --> 00:14:40.343]  Good to talk to you.
[00:14:40.363 --> 00:14:56.251]  I just want to point out this article that AP put out on January 7th about how they're using RFID chips on students' backpacks in Rhode Island.
[00:15:04.098 --> 00:15:14.045]  Yeah, the ACLU has a lot of well-meaning members in it, but it's loyal opposition.
[00:15:14.085 --> 00:15:15.946]  Predominantly, it goes and creates bad case law.
[00:15:15.966 --> 00:15:17.247]  It goes and loses the cases.
[00:15:17.767 --> 00:15:23.630]  It attacks things that are rights, and then doesn't properly defend things that are rights as well.
[00:15:24.811 --> 00:15:25.932]  So you get a mixed bag with them.
[00:15:26.525 --> 00:15:36.170]  But that aside, the Pentagon officially said more than a decade ago that they were going to have RFID in all products, that they were going to demand that all manufacturers have that in place by 2004.
[00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:38.171]  They're a few years behind.
[00:15:38.191 --> 00:15:48.437]  It was the Pentagon that enforced the acceptance of the Universal Product Code, the barcode, by the mid-eighties.
[00:15:48.457 --> 00:15:50.098]  It was also Walmart.
[00:15:50.158 --> 00:15:55.281]  But Walmart and the Pentagon in 2000 had a public partnership to demand that all of their
[00:15:56.403 --> 00:16:14.950]  Suppliers, from everything from shavers to cans of soup, all have tiny little tags on them and then when you pay, even with cash in the future, with the new national sales tax they're pushing as a replacement for the income tax, they're actually going to keep both, they will scan that and then that will go on the record of what you purchased.
[00:16:15.971 --> 00:16:19.052]  Also, face scanning cameras were nationwide five years ago.
[00:16:19.887 --> 00:16:24.050]  Cameras that recognize the shape of your face, your ear, your walk, your voice.
[00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:28.932]  Most cities have thousands of microphones and tens of thousands of cameras.
[00:16:28.992 --> 00:16:30.113]  Most of them you don't even see.
[00:16:31.254 --> 00:16:34.996]  That all goes into emergency management centers that are shared with the locals that are run by FEMA.
[00:16:35.496 --> 00:16:37.637]  And so the military industrial complex is just taking over.
[00:16:38.138 --> 00:16:47.643]  All over the country they're making school teachers and also realtors biometrically scan their hands and fingers and faces and retinas, depending on the state.
[00:16:47.923 --> 00:16:48.884]  It's all federally funded.
[00:16:49.824 --> 00:16:55.789]  And then the government selectively enforces, you can be a convicted coke dealer and run the elections in New Hampshire and that's okay.
[00:16:56.049 --> 00:16:57.971]  They then just selectively enforce that.
[00:16:58.051 --> 00:17:04.256]  Once they have your fingerprints too, they can easily fake them and then go and frame you in the government, federal and state.
[00:17:04.636 --> 00:17:06.578]  I've been caught literally tens of thousands of times.
[00:17:07.651 --> 00:17:13.258]  Doing that, and the Department of Education, the Pentagon, and others admit that the schools are the training grounds of the future.
[00:17:14.199 --> 00:17:20.527]  Thousands of school districts have cameras all over the schools, in the classrooms, in the bathrooms, even over the urinals and toilets.
[00:17:21.148 --> 00:17:21.769]  It's just total 1984.
[00:17:23.584 --> 00:17:26.506]  RFID going in everywhere, tracking everything we do.
[00:17:27.347 --> 00:17:30.849]  Just six months ago, they were still denying that they were listening to our phones.
[00:17:30.869 --> 00:17:31.790]  It was just for Al-Qaeda.
[00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:36.653]  Now they admit, OK, we're going to read all your emails, track everything you do, have a whole history of all your web searches.
[00:17:37.054 --> 00:17:39.816]  By the time they're telling you about something, it's already in place.
[00:17:40.216 --> 00:17:48.822]  We have private corporate owners who are doing everything they can to make a cynical, dumbed-down, unengaged in this process.
[00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:53.071]  They control most of the states with electronic fraud driven machines.
[00:17:53.091 --> 00:17:55.512]  They've been caught in every state doing it.
[00:17:55.672 --> 00:17:59.893]  I mean, it really is a hellish future with this technocracy that we have in place running things.
[00:18:00.973 --> 00:18:06.175]  And it's our job to get the people to realize just how serious and how bad this is because these are some very bad people.
[00:18:06.515 --> 00:18:11.397]  They want this control grid in place so they can completely destroy our standard of living and bring us back to a feudalist state.
[00:18:11.977 --> 00:18:13.497]  We're going to be covering that after the break.
[00:18:13.877 --> 00:18:15.298]  Let's go ahead now and take another call.
[00:18:16.715 --> 00:18:20.118]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ed in L.A.
[00:18:20.498 --> 00:18:21.759]  says that he disagrees.
[00:18:21.779 --> 00:18:22.640]  Ed, you're on the air.
[00:18:23.441 --> 00:18:29.646]  Yeah, Alex, I'm a real big fan, but the way you interview, you're like a big fat pumpkin head.
[00:18:29.666 --> 00:18:30.907]  You don't let anybody talk.
[00:18:32.148 --> 00:18:35.610]  The grandfather of Reaganomics told you to shut up sometimes.
[00:18:36.431 --> 00:18:45.218]  Why don't you shut up when somebody's talking and when you're interviewing somebody, listen to them so everybody can listen to them.
[00:18:45.706 --> 00:18:52.654]  And the best part of your show, which I do agree, is when you digress, and when you go and rant and raving.
[00:18:53.115 --> 00:18:53.996]  Big fan, Alex.
[00:18:54.476 --> 00:18:54.837]  Alright.
[00:18:55.137 --> 00:19:00.683]  You know, I re-aired that Dr. Paul Craig Roberts interview from a few months ago, where he told me, shut up and let him finish.
[00:19:00.703 --> 00:19:02.065]  See, I don't care what you think of me.
[00:19:02.105 --> 00:19:03.106]  I don't care how it sounds.
[00:19:03.507 --> 00:19:05.489]  Why am I, quote, the king of conspiracy?
[00:19:06.352 --> 00:19:09.735]  Why am I the most listened to in this whole genre?
[00:19:09.955 --> 00:19:13.478]  Why do I have the biggest websites at prisonplanet.com and truthnews.us?
[00:19:13.898 --> 00:19:16.520]  It's because I do the show the way I want to.
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:21.464]  And if I want to make a point, and if I want to stop a guest, and I want to add something, I'm going to do it.
[00:19:22.164 --> 00:19:26.908]  Actually, if you watch the shows on CNN or Fox, they all talk about 20 seconds and then interrupt the other one.
[00:19:27.408 --> 00:19:32.112]  I sit there and I let people talk one, two, three minutes at a time, sometimes before I jump in.
[00:19:32.872 --> 00:19:33.453]  So you really
[00:19:34.793 --> 00:19:36.394]  You are just a little bit confused there, sir.
[00:19:36.714 --> 00:19:40.116]  But I know you're a big fan and all, but if you don't like the way I do the show, just don't listen.
[00:19:40.136 --> 00:19:41.997]  Because that's another thing about me.
[00:19:42.097 --> 00:19:43.378]  I don't care if you listen to my show.
[00:19:43.998 --> 00:19:45.859]  Really, I'm not doing this for fun or for kicks.
[00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:48.581]  This is about the information.
[00:19:49.161 --> 00:19:54.264]  And I'm strongly considered, because I have so much news and information, sometimes not even taking calls.
[00:19:55.224 --> 00:19:56.125]  I enjoy your calls.
[00:19:56.165 --> 00:19:58.366]  I enjoy the directions they take us in.
[00:19:58.386 --> 00:20:00.227]  People that disagree go to the head of the line, by the way.
[00:20:01.134 --> 00:20:05.417]  But at the same time, I have a lot of really serious issues that need to be covered here.
[00:20:05.897 --> 00:20:09.279]  Okay, let's go ahead now and let's talk to Mark in Atlanta.
[00:20:09.339 --> 00:20:11.321]  Let's talk about the recount in New Hampshire.
[00:20:12.061 --> 00:20:12.681]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:20:13.362 --> 00:20:23.568]  Well, brother, you're ever in our prayers, and I hope you're going to keep me in your prayers, because to be honest, right now all I am is sound as a dollar, and we all know how bad that is.
[00:20:23.648 --> 00:20:29.452]  Hopefully, I'm going to be getting a real job before too long, because the new world order has not been kind to me.
[00:20:30.872 --> 00:20:40.056]  Yeah, I've been trying to find out, because I saw one little blurb that said there were some discrepancies with the recount, but I haven't heard any actual results yet.
[00:20:40.497 --> 00:20:48.660]  Are they not finished folding, spindling, and mutilating the ballots to their desired ends, or what's going on?
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:52.202]  Well, you know, that's the situation, and it's a good point you bring up.
[00:20:52.322 --> 00:20:55.123]  In New Hampshire, then it's the central Democratic side.
[00:20:55.643 --> 00:21:01.448]  And of course, then one of the lower-level Republican candidates on the Republican side went for a recount.
[00:21:01.468 --> 00:21:03.690]  We supported that, but then you have the same people.
[00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:13.497]  The Bev Harris election fraud expert, who of course produced Hacking Democracy, was their expert for HBO special, went out there and just said, it's the same people that did this that are recounting it.
[00:21:14.258 --> 00:21:21.504]  And see, for the first time, suddenly the polls in the past were always accurate, especially when it showed big spreads, big differences.
[00:21:23.005 --> 00:21:24.046]  And we had
[00:21:25.754 --> 00:21:30.176]  Barack Obama, in the lowest polls, 13 points ahead, then he loses by almost 4 points.
[00:21:30.676 --> 00:21:33.998]  So that's a 16 point plus difference between Obama and Clinton.
[00:21:34.798 --> 00:21:36.559]  The truth is, Hillary Clinton's unpopular.
[00:21:36.579 --> 00:21:38.180]  The people know she's established, but they don't want her.
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:38.900]  It doesn't matter.
[00:21:39.621 --> 00:21:48.665]  Rob Paul was double what he got in the polls in New Hampshire, but magically didn't, and then all these discrepancies came up, and zero ballots counted for him in townships where he got votes.
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.842]  So, no, I haven't gotten the latest word on that.
[00:21:51.902 --> 00:21:53.223]  It takes a while to do that recount.
[00:21:53.743 --> 00:21:55.465]  And we're just in a pickle, sir.
[00:21:55.765 --> 00:21:59.268]  We're in a very, very serious situation.
[00:21:59.528 --> 00:22:03.251]  Let's jam in one more call before we go to break.
[00:22:04.111 --> 00:22:06.953]  Let's talk to Jay in Tennessee.
[00:22:06.993 --> 00:22:07.894]  You're on the air, Jay.
[00:22:08.835 --> 00:22:09.896]  Alex, how you doing?
[00:22:09.936 --> 00:22:18.662]  Hey, I noticed on TruthNews you posted a really good article about Bertrand Russell and his discussions about the social changes that
[00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:22.324]  Stay there, I'm going to let you finish up on the other side, Jay, okay?
[00:22:32.358 --> 00:22:37.940]  We'll be right back and talk about the scientific dictatorship, because that leads perfectly into the economic news.
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:50.225]  This is a process of shackling you, a process of hurting you, controlling you, dumbing you down, and until you become aware of that process, we have no hope of stopping and then reversing this trend towards absolute despotism.
[00:22:50.425 --> 00:22:50.985]  We'll be right back.
[00:23:00.679 --> 00:23:02.161]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond.
[00:23:02.501 --> 00:23:08.007]  You can now get the most important package ever on what has happened to the Catholic Church in the last 50 years.
[00:23:08.487 --> 00:23:16.415]  Find out how this massive crisis concerning the Catholic Church happened, what happened, and how the Bible predicted it would take place in the last days.
[00:23:16.895 --> 00:23:17.135]  I think so.
[00:23:40.473 --> 00:23:45.137]  That's 1-800-275-1126 or mail in your order to us at 4425 Schneider Road, Fillmore, NY 14735.

[00:24:00.802 --> 00:24:09.206]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on Earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.

[00:27:30.709 --> 00:27:32.069]  Taking your phone calls at 877-590-5525.
[00:27:32.109 --> 00:27:37.271]  Listen to us in Texas, 836-0590.
[00:27:37.652 --> 00:27:41.553]  I'm going to finish up with this call and get into some of the economic news.
[00:27:41.613 --> 00:27:44.134]  And coming up, Mexico ready to interfere in U.S.
[00:27:44.214 --> 00:27:44.634]  elections.
[00:27:44.654 --> 00:27:45.415]  I've got news for you.
[00:27:45.435 --> 00:27:47.796]  It's already happening, but that's from CNN.
[00:27:48.887 --> 00:27:54.989]  Going back to Jay in Tennessee talking about the scientific dictatorship for folks that don't know.
[00:27:55.956 --> 00:28:04.399]  Hundreds of textbooks, thousands of documents, hundreds and hundreds of books by top sociologists, top PR masters, the father of modern advertising, Edward Bernays.
[00:28:04.919 --> 00:28:09.161]  I mean, literally, it's all they talk about is how to control people, how people operate, how to manipulate them.
[00:28:09.601 --> 00:28:12.522]  They even taught you to not believe that even exists.
[00:28:12.602 --> 00:28:20.785]  Believe me, it does exist, and my job is not even to convince you of anything, it's to get you to realize that things are happening around you, that people are trying to influence you.
[00:28:21.397 --> 00:28:30.644]  And I'm very honest, and I'm trying to influence you, but they're more subtle in the different types of propaganda, this propaganda net, web that they put over you.
[00:28:31.525 --> 00:28:33.026]  But they said in the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s,
[00:28:34.568 --> 00:28:37.490]  They would basically take kids away from their parents by using the schools.
[00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:38.971]  They would drug the children.
[00:28:39.831 --> 00:28:40.852]  They would dumb them down.
[00:28:40.892 --> 00:28:43.193]  They would teach them to just be mindless and petty.
[00:28:43.754 --> 00:28:49.117]  They would use baubles and trinkets and constantly chasing the dollar to make people envious and greedy.
[00:28:49.177 --> 00:28:55.121]  They would pay women and not have men in the house to break up the family with welfare.
[00:28:55.981 --> 00:28:57.862]  All these things to help you.
[00:28:58.383 --> 00:29:01.545]  And I assure you, helping you is not what they're after.
[00:29:01.705 --> 00:29:03.486]  Total domination, total control.
[00:29:04.153 --> 00:29:05.554]  What are we doing today, Pinky?
[00:29:05.614 --> 00:29:06.775]  The same thing we do every day.
[00:29:07.256 --> 00:29:08.397]  Trying to take over the world.
[00:29:08.417 --> 00:29:11.599]  You know, the old rock and roll song, everybody wants to rule the world.
[00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:13.861]  Well, that's what they certainly in the elite want.
[00:29:14.482 --> 00:29:15.523]  Jay in Tennessee.
[00:29:15.843 --> 00:29:17.885]  Go ahead, sir, and finish up your statement.
[00:29:19.686 --> 00:29:26.532]  I've taught upper-level social theory classes, and just like you said, you don't have to go very far in the
[00:29:27.327 --> 00:29:27.747]  We're good.
[00:29:48.148 --> 00:30:04.701]  Yeah, Thomas Jefferson 230-240 years ago wrote that we had to stay agrarian, but also stay very educated yeoman farmer, because centralization in cities would allow the elites of Europe, as they'd always done, to get total control.
[00:30:04.721 --> 00:30:05.963]  Exactly.
[00:30:06.123 --> 00:30:12.448]  And that's precisely what Russell was saying in an article he posted on Truth News.
[00:30:13.476 --> 00:30:22.925]  And so, I mean, as a response to the guy who called in a few weeks ago trying to argue that Bertrand Russell was a good guy, I mean, there's nothing good about Bertrand Russell.
[00:30:23.205 --> 00:30:25.847]  Bertrand Russell said that blacks were basically not human.
[00:30:26.388 --> 00:30:26.808]  Exactly.
[00:30:27.248 --> 00:30:31.953]  But, oh, we're not supposed to read his books that say that because he's a Nobel Prize winner and the liberals say he's great.
[00:30:31.973 --> 00:30:35.236]  I mean, Margaret Singer gave awards to Hitler, got awards from him.
[00:30:35.756 --> 00:30:37.758]  We have all her letters calling blacks weeds.
[00:30:38.422 --> 00:30:44.906]  But then, again, folks, all these poor black people out there, just like everybody else, who believes the system cares about them, and the liberals love you.
[00:30:45.307 --> 00:30:46.387]  Oh yeah, they really love you.
[00:30:47.128 --> 00:30:47.868]  They really love you.
[00:30:47.888 --> 00:30:51.431]  Let me tell you, they want to totally dominate you.
[00:30:52.311 --> 00:30:58.495]  Alright, we're going to go back to your calls, Greg and Andrew and others coming up, but let me get into the economy.
[00:30:58.515 --> 00:31:05.380]  If you've been listening to me the last ten years, or even the last year, six months, you know I've been saying that
[00:31:06.101 --> 00:31:32.718]  The globalists stated in the seventies with the Trilateral Commission public statements that they would create a euro as they've done, they would then create a union in North America, then larger, that they would destroy the dollar, and they would then have a currency crisis that went on for several years or longer, as long as a decade, between the dollar and the euro and other competing currencies, and then have a global benchmark
[00:31:34.064 --> 00:31:40.668]  On a new global cashless society, currency that they can fully control and manipulate.
[00:31:40.968 --> 00:31:43.970]  And if you weren't a good little globalist, they'd turn your national ID card off.
[00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:47.412]  If you're not a good little globalist, they're going to have debtor prisons again.
[00:31:47.752 --> 00:31:54.455]  You walk outside your house, or even if you're homeless, the camera face scans you, police come and pick you up and put you in a labor camp.
[00:31:54.496 --> 00:31:56.176]  They're now proposing this, talking about it.
[00:31:56.697 --> 00:31:59.498]  So everything they said decades ago, they're now implementing.
[00:32:01.557 --> 00:32:09.044]  This is a report from the New York Times today, and it says, Seeking Tools to Calm a Market.
[00:32:09.304 --> 00:32:13.308]  And of course, they put this, they couch this, as the government's trying to help you, but listen carefully.
[00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:22.175]  They go on to report that we had a 59.91 fall just this last week, and the Dow at 12,099.30.
[00:32:27.006 --> 00:32:36.590]  And they say that Friday the Dow in the next year could sink, this is the New York Times, to 6,000 by the end of the year as the country slides into deep recession.
[00:32:38.051 --> 00:32:39.532]  And it goes on from there.
[00:32:40.412 --> 00:32:43.253]  But see, even that is just the surface.
[00:32:43.894 --> 00:32:48.876]  If you have the dollar at less than half the value it was in 2000.
[00:32:49.196 --> 00:32:52.438]  This is very simple 2 plus 2 equals 4 stuff.
[00:32:53.998 --> 00:32:55.119]  If you look at that
[00:32:56.121 --> 00:32:58.924]  Then you realize that the stock market is really below $6,000.
[00:32:58.964 --> 00:33:08.513]  So if it drops to $6,000 now, but in real worth is only worth $6,000, currently it'll be worth less than $3,000.
[00:33:09.314 --> 00:33:12.316]  And I get emails from people saying, I'm a stockbroker, I'm a whatever.
[00:33:12.577 --> 00:33:13.858]  You don't need to talk about this.
[00:33:13.958 --> 00:33:16.020]  It may be true, but it destroys confidence.
[00:33:16.744 --> 00:33:20.285]  And, you know, this is going to... Look, I'm not the one that set up this fiat system.
[00:33:20.745 --> 00:33:45.349]  You know, we got the IMF World Bank documents when their chief economist, Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz, quit in 2002, and there was the IMF saying, we've bankrupted all these third world countries, and then once they're imploded, they like that, once they totally fall apart and have a depression, the big central banks that still issue the currencies and have the foreign strong currencies they control, can come in and literally fire sale everything and buy it up.
[00:33:46.585 --> 00:33:46.945]  Okay?
[00:33:48.106 --> 00:33:51.627]  That's why they've done this to third world country after third world country after third world country.
[00:33:52.027 --> 00:33:56.928]  And that's why now it is starting to come home to roost here.
[00:33:57.629 --> 00:33:59.309]  And they're doing it by design.
[00:33:59.829 --> 00:34:01.730]  Now the very same global interest.
[00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:03.410]  These are not capitalists.
[00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:04.271]  These are not free market.
[00:34:04.291 --> 00:34:05.071]  They're robber barons.
[00:34:05.311 --> 00:34:08.892]  They're monopoly men who control the issuance of currency and credit.
[00:34:09.432 --> 00:34:09.512]  Okay?
[00:34:09.532 --> 00:34:11.393]  And that's why they run everything and own everything.
[00:34:12.122 --> 00:34:17.024]  I mean, everything in the free market, all the supposed wealth that they don't control is only about 20%.
[00:34:18.005 --> 00:34:19.365]  They have 80% of everything.
[00:34:19.725 --> 00:34:20.866]  Now they want it all.
[00:34:21.466 --> 00:34:25.888]  And to do that, they have to have a global slide into deep recession and then depression.
[00:34:26.148 --> 00:34:27.869]  They're going to call it depression or recession.
[00:34:28.229 --> 00:34:34.732]  We have not been out of a recession for decades.
[00:34:35.592 --> 00:34:37.893]  The debt goes up, corporate, government, private.
[00:34:40.029 --> 00:34:43.811]  Amount of hours you have to work, your standard of living and reality goes down.
[00:34:43.851 --> 00:34:48.473]  Just because your house that was $200,000 is now $500,000, that's devalued currency.
[00:34:49.213 --> 00:34:51.074]  Everybody's leveraged out on their credit cards.
[00:34:51.694 --> 00:35:00.558]  This was all done and precipitated, and this is in their own documents, this is what's so incredible, by design to get you into this position.
[00:35:00.658 --> 00:35:08.381]  Now, they suddenly announce, remember on a conspiracy theory a month ago, a year ago, two years ago, talking about the exact issues, you can now read the news,
[00:35:09.048 --> 00:35:11.770]  But they spin it and say, don't worry, we'll freeze interest rates.
[00:35:12.971 --> 00:35:25.040]  Well, if they freeze interest rates at 5%, 5.5%, then the world that's already running away from the dollar isn't going to continue to buy securities in the dollar, and the dollar's going to drop even more.
[00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:32.906]  And they've now made the decision to have another rate cut, and of course the dollar went down in the last few weeks, and gold went up to over $910 an ounce.
[00:35:34.147 --> 00:35:35.989]  That's because gold didn't really go up
[00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:39.571]  The dollar went down.
[00:35:39.872 --> 00:35:46.177]  And so you've lost more than half your value, half your savings, half of everything you've got in the last seven years.
[00:35:47.358 --> 00:35:54.905]  And they're having debates about one or two percent tax cuts, or tax credits on your mortgages, or freezing mortgages.
[00:35:54.945 --> 00:36:00.270]  And they're saying that it all spirals around bad debt with the mortgages.
[00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:02.131]  But that's only one problem.
[00:36:02.432 --> 00:36:03.733]  What have I been saying for three years?
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:13.448]  Since we learned in 2005-2006, I went to the Bilderberg Group with 125 richest people in the world, the royalty, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, they're all there.
[00:36:14.469 --> 00:36:18.112]  We had people inside, we got the data out, and we told you what was going to happen.
[00:36:18.132 --> 00:36:27.920]  We said they're going to kill the housing market, they want to bring the market down by design to start the unraveling of the economy so they can come in after they've blown it out and loot!
[00:36:28.761 --> 00:36:28.941]  Now!
[00:36:29.611 --> 00:36:31.092]  Those shows are all on the internet.
[00:36:31.112 --> 00:36:33.454]  The articles we wrote are all at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:36:33.855 --> 00:36:34.595]  I'm on record.
[00:36:35.336 --> 00:36:36.157]  Always right.
[00:36:36.677 --> 00:36:37.738]  Always on target.
[00:36:38.368 --> 00:36:41.810]  Because I read what they say they're going to do to us!
[00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:43.331]  IT ISN'T HARD!
[00:36:43.591 --> 00:36:44.852]  AND I'M TIRED OF IT!
[00:36:45.052 --> 00:36:48.755]  IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO FIND OUT WHO OUR REAL ENEMY IS!
[00:36:49.015 --> 00:36:49.935]  AND GET MAD!
[00:36:50.236 --> 00:36:55.959]  BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T GET MAD AND TAKE ACTION, THEY'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND DECIDE TO TAKE US DOWN TO ZERO!
[00:36:55.979 --> 00:36:57.660]  I DON'T WANNA BE A SLAVE!
[00:36:57.940 --> 00:36:59.001]  STAND UP TO THEM!
[00:36:59.181 --> 00:37:00.602]  DON'T YOU WANNA BE FREE?!
[00:37:00.822 --> 00:37:04.805]  It seems like every time you pull up to the pump, gas prices have gone up again.
[00:37:06.766 --> 00:37:07.146]  We're good to go.
[00:37:23.286 --> 00:37:27.029]  It works with regular or synthetic motor oil and can even be used in diesel engines.

[00:38:00.035 --> 00:38:01.236]  Hi, neighbor.
[00:38:01.836 --> 00:38:03.497]  The world famine is in its third year.
[00:38:03.917 --> 00:38:06.038]  Our harvest is too small to get through the year.
[00:38:06.639 --> 00:38:13.443]  Genetically poisoned food, dangerous food imports, and constantly recalled disease-contaminated foods are mixed in with our safe food.
[00:38:14.312 --> 00:38:17.093]  Farm food production has turned into ethanol fuel.
[00:38:17.733 --> 00:38:18.414]  What should I do?
[00:38:18.934 --> 00:38:21.635]  How long can I afford food or till there's no food?
[00:38:22.215 --> 00:38:23.676]  How long before it's all poisoned?
[00:38:24.276 --> 00:38:26.537]  Will three years worth of food supply be enough?
[00:38:26.997 --> 00:38:30.438]  Or will it only postpone my trip to the population control breadline?
[00:38:30.898 --> 00:38:32.999]  Will it be okay to wait till after the holidays?
[00:38:33.439 --> 00:38:37.421]  I'll use what I didn't spend on Christmas for a something-is-better-than-nothing supply.
[00:38:37.901 --> 00:38:38.781]  I'll get the rest later.
[00:38:39.202 --> 00:38:40.102]  How long do I dare wait?
[00:38:40.905 --> 00:38:44.108]  I know I'll regret not starting sooner and not getting enough food.
[00:38:44.728 --> 00:38:46.890]  I have to decide while I still have a choice.
[00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:48.291]  Tell me what to do.
[00:38:48.952 --> 00:38:51.414]  Now take your own advice and call 800-409-5633 or on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:38:51.434 --> 00:38:51.574]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:06.545]  Now that we are in the midst of the presidential primaries, Republican candidate Ron Paul needs our support more than ever.
[00:39:06.945 --> 00:39:12.930]  Ron Paul stands for the issues that need to be addressed and not glossed over and forgotten like the globalist crowd being fielded.
[00:39:13.291 --> 00:39:18.355]  Unlike other candidates, Ron Paul takes a stand to follow what our forefathers envisioned America to be.
[00:39:18.575 --> 00:39:29.977]  Through the Constitution, Dr. Paul will restore sound money, eliminate the IRS, prevent the NAU, get us back to our constitutional roots, and guard our nation here at home by bringing home the troops.
[00:39:30.377 --> 00:39:32.238]  Show your support for Ron Paul today.
[00:39:32.498 --> 00:39:39.199]  Go to RonPaulStickers.com to find the latest Ron Paul promotional media to help promote our last hope for America.
[00:39:39.479 --> 00:39:42.420]  Yard signs, buffer stickers, window decals, buttons,
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:43.041]  I think so.
[00:40:00.206 --> 00:40:00.947]  Job stress.
[00:40:01.127 --> 00:40:02.249]  Painful relationships.
[00:40:02.449 --> 00:40:03.730]  Unbearable money pressures.
[00:40:03.831 --> 00:40:05.392]  Deteriorating health conditions.
[00:40:05.593 --> 00:40:11.900]  Are political uncertainties and a world spinning out of control keeping you from getting the restful sleep your body desperately needs?
[00:40:12.241 --> 00:40:12.721]  It's true.
[00:40:12.941 --> 00:40:16.706]  Researchers now know that insufficient sleep can lead to dangerous health problems.
[00:40:16.806 --> 00:40:17.106]  I think so.
[00:40:39.673 --> 00:40:40.273]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:40:40.293 --> 00:40:41.594]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:41:13.965 --> 00:41:18.807]  Alright, we're back live, and we've got LeVon, Eric, Greg, Andrew, and many others patiently holding at 877-590-5525.
[00:41:19.247 --> 00:41:21.388]  Alright.
[00:41:22.869 --> 00:41:41.037]  I challenge new listeners, listening around the country on AM, FM, dial, shortwave, internet, satellite, to go back and just look at the financial reports we've put out at PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com, and some of them in the last 6, 7, 8 years,
[00:41:42.483 --> 00:41:45.265]  Documenting what was going to happen, exactly what was going to happen.
[00:41:45.665 --> 00:41:46.926]  Imagine you're the private banks.
[00:41:46.946 --> 00:41:49.848]  You've somehow brought control of the governments the last 200 years, the U.S.
[00:41:49.888 --> 00:41:50.348]  in the last 90.
[00:41:51.689 --> 00:41:53.851]  You are able to issue all the credit you want.
[00:41:53.911 --> 00:42:04.178]  You issue it in a predatory way like a loan shark to fully bankrupt and to create an economic system where no one could pay it off so you could consolidate.
[00:42:05.114 --> 00:42:14.518]  Under the guise of growing the economy, where really what you were doing was getting everybody in a position where you could pull a rug fully out from under them.
[00:42:15.358 --> 00:42:28.583]  Now, there are hundreds and hundreds of things that they're able to do once they implode an economy, but I keep explaining that when the dollar loses 60% of its value against the euro in the last seven years, I keep saying seven, it's since 2000, it's been eight years,
[00:42:30.353 --> 00:42:33.976]  So in the last eight years, that they're able to then come in and buy up everything.
[00:42:33.996 --> 00:42:38.581]  But they don't just come in and buy up companies and sections of the stock market and the media and Hollywood.
[00:42:39.902 --> 00:42:43.745]  They don't just come in and buy the gold mines and the mineral deposits.
[00:42:44.146 --> 00:42:47.149]  They come in and buy off your politicians criminally, corruptly.
[00:42:47.369 --> 00:42:50.892]  They come in and buy them off publicly and they hand them over the roads for nothing.
[00:42:51.653 --> 00:42:52.874]  Just for campaign contributions.
[00:42:52.914 --> 00:42:53.935]  They hand over the reservoirs.
[00:42:53.975 --> 00:42:55.156]  They hand over the power plants.
[00:42:55.655 --> 00:42:56.656]  They hand them all over.
[00:42:57.097 --> 00:43:00.861]  I mean, this is full-scale looting that is going on.
[00:43:00.901 --> 00:43:02.122]  Here's the New York Times today.
[00:43:02.282 --> 00:43:05.326]  Overseas investors buy aggressively in the U.S.
[00:43:05.926 --> 00:43:08.769]  Last May, a Saudi Arabian conglomerate bought a Massachusetts plastic maker.
[00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:11.893]  In November, a French company established a new factory in Adrian, Michigan.
[00:43:12.934 --> 00:43:16.378]  And then it goes on to make it look positive and just mention just a few.
[00:43:17.699 --> 00:43:18.940]  And I guess in a sick way, it's true.
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:24.343]  As we become more and more third world, we'll start competing with China and India and places, but we'll live like they do.
[00:43:24.723 --> 00:43:33.388]  For much of the world, the United States is now on sale at discount prices, this is the New York Times, with credit tight, unemployment growing, and worries mounting about a potential recession.
[00:43:33.508 --> 00:43:35.049]  A potential recession!
[00:43:36.450 --> 00:43:42.954]  They supposedly have said since 2001 to 2007, the economic numbers, that we have this big boom.
[00:43:43.596 --> 00:43:48.998]  But the median income lost a thousand dollars in this nation.
[00:43:49.959 --> 00:43:53.580]  In six plus years, we lost a thousand dollars per worker.
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:56.281]  That was per worker, not just household.
[00:43:56.301 --> 00:43:57.181]  It was more per household.
[00:43:57.441 --> 00:43:58.342]  Go pull these numbers up.
[00:43:58.362 --> 00:43:59.362]  I was reading them just last week.
[00:44:00.203 --> 00:44:04.104]  Speaking of Treasury, former Treasury head, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:44:04.124 --> 00:44:07.105]  I was talking to him about it live just a few weeks ago.
[00:44:08.446 --> 00:44:11.507]  And this is what they're doing to our economy.
[00:44:12.495 --> 00:44:14.937]  And they're coming in and snatching and grabbing it all up.
[00:44:15.638 --> 00:44:23.063]  And the governments of the world have dumped over 700 billion dollars, half of that from the US, into banks to quote, make them solvent.
[00:44:23.444 --> 00:44:25.926]  All they're doing is acting like they're doing something.
[00:44:26.246 --> 00:44:33.832]  The Financial Times of London has even been honest about it and said that the big central banks are running all this to consolidate the medium-sized banks.
[00:44:34.472 --> 00:44:35.073]  And you think of a
[00:44:35.896 --> 00:44:41.697]  Countrywide, or you think of a Northern Rock, you think of one of those as a huge bank, that's actually a retail bank to you, the consumer.
[00:44:41.917 --> 00:44:46.459]  They're small compared to the central banks that are the top of this credit pyramid.
[00:44:46.639 --> 00:44:51.420]  And they just unleashed this huge tsunami of currency and credit.
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:56.501]  But then it devalues it, but they don't care because they're going to get the real assets.
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:01.602]  Imagine if you had a money and credit machine, how long would it take you to take over society?
[00:45:01.982 --> 00:45:03.142]  Not very long.
[00:45:03.662 --> 00:45:05.363]  And that's what these individuals have done.
[00:45:05.403 --> 00:45:10.465]  And now the Council on Foreign Relations comes right out in the open on their own website.
[00:45:10.505 --> 00:45:13.386]  We have this posted for posterity on truthnews.us.
[00:45:13.686 --> 00:45:18.688]  CFR, the historical anomaly of the dollar, and they go on to say we need a global currency.
[00:45:19.238 --> 00:45:43.469]  But then you talk about this, and the mainstream media, see the mainstream media will spin watered down lie, predominantly, but then in the actual publications put out by these different organizations, this is really the shadow government, people that operate our nation, they're very open about it, knowing that the average American is too busy watching reality TV and into Britney Spears and her new English accent, or OJ being brought in and arraigned in court,
[00:45:44.244 --> 00:45:51.287]  Instead of being concerned about how the world really works, or who runs things, and what do they have planned for the economy that we all live in.
[00:45:51.488 --> 00:45:54.909]  They can't get away with this unless you're ignorant and unengaged.
[00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:57.130]  So again, I am lecturing.
[00:45:57.170 --> 00:45:59.411]  Please, please, you're smart.
[00:46:00.172 --> 00:46:12.718]  You know all about the football plays, and all about the Cowboys and the Giants, and all about the Pats, and you know everything about how much each player weighs, and what kind of car they drive, and you, you know, you're an expert on that, but you don't understand fiat currencies.
[00:46:13.823 --> 00:46:30.112]  Now before I go back to your calls, and then I've got a bunch of other election news, and also some really serious environmental news and economic news I'm going to be going over, I wanted to play just a minute or so, and this too is up on TruthNews.us, from a YouTube clip of CNN Friday.
[00:46:31.092 --> 00:46:36.595]  And this is Lou Dobbs, and I'd already reported on this, and I'm not bragging, I'm just saying this has been going on a long time.
[00:46:37.159 --> 00:46:39.642]  But now it's finally getting attention.
[00:46:39.662 --> 00:46:47.811]  Remember I told you two years ago that those big Mexican rallies all over the country calling for open borders, calling for the end of the U.S., saying this is Mexico?
[00:46:47.831 --> 00:46:51.514]  That those were funded by the Mexican government and the White House.
[00:46:51.895 --> 00:46:54.358]  And it was even in the Dallas Morning News that nobody gave it any attention.
[00:46:54.598 --> 00:46:55.679]  Even Bilo got it right.
[00:46:56.360 --> 00:47:01.563]  They said, oh yeah, millions of dollars by this big PR firm, the Mexican government, the U.S.
[00:47:01.583 --> 00:47:06.145]  government are funding in Dallas to run it out of Mexico and into the U.S.
[00:47:06.385 --> 00:47:08.146]  With the media all saying how great it is.
[00:47:08.366 --> 00:47:11.968]  But citizens go out and protest the war, the riot cops will come beat your head in.
[00:47:12.188 --> 00:47:14.189]  But the illegal aliens can run out and block highways.
[00:47:14.809 --> 00:47:16.390]  And we'll tell you why that's so important.
[00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:17.871]  I'm not even against the illegal aliens.
[00:47:18.631 --> 00:47:22.133]  I mean, you've all been brainwashed at the general public, just your own form of brainwashing, your own flavor.
[00:47:23.562 --> 00:47:28.104]  This is big picture, but first, because you don't believe me, some of you out there, here it is, Lou Dobbs.
[00:47:29.325 --> 00:47:39.489]  The battle over illegal immigration is about to become the subject of a multi-million dollar advertising campaign in this country, and guess who may be paying for a large part of that?
[00:47:39.609 --> 00:47:40.369]  You'll never guess.
[00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:42.170]  The government of Mexico!
[00:47:42.690 --> 00:47:43.051]  A U.S.
[00:47:43.091 --> 00:47:51.234]  advertising executive says he's close to a deal with the Mexican government to help fund a hundred million dollar ad campaign that would be pushing, you guessed it,
[00:47:52.114 --> 00:47:53.774]  Amnesty for Illegal Aliens.
[00:47:54.355 --> 00:47:55.695]  Casey Wyant has our report.
[00:47:57.595 --> 00:47:58.876]  Lobbying groups for the U.S.
[00:47:58.936 --> 00:48:10.178]  construction, agriculture, and other industries with large illegal alien workforces are funding a series of pro-amnesty TV ads scheduled to air after this year's presidential convention.
[00:48:11.078 --> 00:48:15.839]  And then it goes in to admit that the Mexican government is footing millions and millions of this.
[00:48:15.899 --> 00:48:18.620]  Now, what did I tell you two years ago?
[00:48:20.149 --> 00:48:24.573]  Now, I didn't learn about this under a toadstool or in a cabbage patch.
[00:48:25.393 --> 00:48:26.634]  It was in the Dallas Morning News.
[00:48:26.735 --> 00:48:31.679]  I took the keywords in it, googled it, and found stuff literally hundreds of times worse.
[00:48:32.019 --> 00:48:33.780]  Because the Dallas Morning News was acting like it was good.
[00:48:34.201 --> 00:48:34.921]  Oh, how cute!
[00:48:34.941 --> 00:48:35.642]  How wonderful!
[00:48:35.682 --> 00:48:36.543]  The Mexican and U.S.
[00:48:36.563 --> 00:48:44.169]  government are funding this big PR firm to put tens of millions of dollars of PR and to contact media and to run a big PR campaign.
[00:48:44.875 --> 00:48:49.258]  And the meatpackers groups who'd fired all the American workers and hired the illegal aliens.
[00:48:50.079 --> 00:48:55.123]  They've paid them with the days off, week after week, to run around and do this in the streets.
[00:48:55.463 --> 00:49:04.209]  Big corporations, the media that's financed and owned by them, the government of the U.S., the government of Mexico, for those same corporate interests.
[00:49:05.350 --> 00:49:06.171]  But here's the problem.
[00:49:06.211 --> 00:49:07.272]  We subsidize that.
[00:49:07.352 --> 00:49:11.475]  The average illegal alien is on triple the welfare of even an inner-city black.
[00:49:11.515 --> 00:49:11.915]  Did you know that?
[00:49:12.055 --> 00:49:14.297]  Because they can have multiple identities and it's not enforced.
[00:49:14.986 --> 00:49:19.432]  Did you know that illegal aliens in almost every major city don't have to have a driver's license?
[00:49:19.452 --> 00:49:20.694]  The police have been told to let them go.
[00:49:20.734 --> 00:49:23.117]  I've had Austin cops admit it to my face, but it's been in the paper.
[00:49:23.137 --> 00:49:27.103]  And when they do arrest them, the judges and the courts and the prosecutors say, let them go.
[00:49:27.604 --> 00:49:28.265]  They're above the law.
[00:49:28.285 --> 00:49:29.546]  They don't have to have insurance, nothing.
[00:49:29.927 --> 00:49:30.508]  Citizens do.
[00:49:31.818 --> 00:49:37.062]  Then they go in and get health care in front of you because the hospitals have been told, serve them first.
[00:49:37.943 --> 00:49:39.184]  They certainly don't have insurance.
[00:49:39.544 --> 00:49:40.385]  They get free health care.
[00:49:40.905 --> 00:49:41.786]  Citizens don't.
[00:49:42.267 --> 00:49:43.127]  Oh, you didn't know this?
[00:49:43.447 --> 00:49:49.973]  Wait until you cut your finger off and try to go to the Bracken Ridge like I did.
[00:49:50.473 --> 00:49:53.315]  And the illegal aliens are all going in right in front of me, not even checking anything.
[00:49:53.615 --> 00:49:58.599]  But as a citizen, I had full insurance, and I had to yell at them after 30 minutes because I didn't want to lose my finger.
[00:49:58.619 --> 00:50:01.741]  It was dangling by a piece of meat to go put my finger on.
[00:50:01.762 --> 00:50:03.703]  I mean, just experience it for yourself.
[00:50:03.883 --> 00:50:05.704]  Kind of like I tell you, Mercury's still on the vaccines.
[00:50:05.945 --> 00:50:07.626]  Go to your doctor and say, I want a vaccine.
[00:50:07.786 --> 00:50:09.287]  When he walks out, say, I want the insert.
[00:50:09.527 --> 00:50:10.888]  Open up the ingredients and read it.
[00:50:11.128 --> 00:50:12.389]  And go, Alex Jones is right.
[00:50:12.570 --> 00:50:13.830]  The mainstream media is lying.
[00:50:14.791 --> 00:50:17.053]  He'll find out the truth, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:18.348 --> 00:50:21.409]  The government's got thousands of unfunded mandates on the states.
[00:50:21.449 --> 00:50:22.570]  The feds do.
[00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:24.871]  They want to bankrupt the states.
[00:50:25.231 --> 00:50:27.132]  Every state in the union's going bankrupt.
[00:50:27.512 --> 00:50:29.173]  And they pile more and more on.
[00:50:29.293 --> 00:50:33.955]  But there's always more money for cops to go out and write tickets and run checkpoints on citizens!
[00:50:36.476 --> 00:50:42.438]  We have got 100 million people in Mexico, 30 million of those living here in the United States, conservatively.
[00:50:43.439 --> 00:50:46.120]  We have got hundreds of millions of Latin Americans
[00:50:46.964 --> 00:50:49.106]  50 plus million new births in Latin America in a year.
[00:50:49.226 --> 00:51:00.172]  That's not even all the other foreigners coming in, who come in and literally get first come, first serve, whatever they want on welfare, which then subsidize them working for five, six bucks an hour.
[00:51:01.053 --> 00:51:13.941]  I'm not against these people individually, but that's why they have Angus and Reed polls, that's why they have Gallup polls showing 67 to upwards of 75 percent, go pull them up for yourself, of Hispanic Americans, who are Americans, and then even naturalized Hispanics,
[00:51:14.651 --> 00:51:16.572]  Who say shut the border down.
[00:51:17.172 --> 00:51:17.633]  Why?
[00:51:17.653 --> 00:51:20.274]  Why when we have an anti-open border rally?
[00:51:20.294 --> 00:51:21.295]  We have a lot of Hispanics there?
[00:51:21.315 --> 00:51:27.718]  Because they know their truck driving job went down from 25 bucks an hour to 12 bucks an hour and it's going down even further.
[00:51:28.394 --> 00:51:33.197]  They know that the company they own is going bankrupt.
[00:51:33.258 --> 00:51:36.700]  They know it's killing the country because they're in the same boat as every other citizen.
[00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:47.367]  But the media tries to act like it's racist and claims that all Hispanics are for open borders when they're not, so other Hispanics feel weird and say they're for it, so everybody else goes along with it.
[00:51:47.628 --> 00:51:50.850]  We'll be right back with a power-packed, info-packed show.
[00:51:51.568 --> 00:51:58.791]  Hi, I'm David, and if you wake up at night to urinate like I was, then you'll want to take advantage of this special risk-free offer.

[00:52:16.937 --> 00:52:17.458]  I think so.

[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:42.901]  Scrap your soul, shit.
[00:52:42.941 --> 00:52:43.181]  Oh, God.

[00:53:05.648 --> 00:53:07.509]  He stands for justice.

[00:53:17.433 --> 00:53:21.194]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[00:53:30.231 --> 00:53:35.914]  All right, we just released another info bomb as we come into the second hour, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:36.315 --> 00:53:44.499]  I'm Alex Jones, your host here every Sunday with this syndicated late edition, the final word at the end of one week, the start of another.
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.502]  Coming up, we told you day one, all the evidence showed it was going to be staged.
[00:53:48.862 --> 00:53:51.884]  It's now come out mainstream news, but back of the paper.
[00:53:52.728 --> 00:54:00.450]  That situation a few weeks ago with the Iranian patrol boats and the audio of, we're going to blow you up in one minute, was absolute bull.
[00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:07.911]  We're going to also get into some of the election news that is developing, but right now, let's get to your phone calls.
[00:54:08.772 --> 00:54:19.154]  I'm just going to, this will be a grab bag, people bringing up all these different subjects that hopefully get our neurons firing in different directions, getting your thinkings what this broadcast is all about.
[00:54:20.147 --> 00:54:23.228]  Let's talk to Greg, listening north of Austin.
[00:54:23.268 --> 00:54:26.249]  I guess a 590 listener here deep in the heart of Texas.
[00:54:26.689 --> 00:54:29.230]  You're on the air, sir.
[00:54:29.250 --> 00:54:29.670]  Go ahead.
[00:54:30.070 --> 00:54:31.831]  Yes, thank you, Mr. Jones.
[00:54:31.851 --> 00:54:35.492]  This is Dr. Gregory Lopriato in Austin, Texas.
[00:54:35.552 --> 00:54:36.832]  We have met, sir.
[00:54:37.573 --> 00:54:42.574]  I was Dave and Laura's best man, and your children play with their children.
[00:54:42.854 --> 00:54:44.235]  We met at the draft house.
[00:54:45.143 --> 00:54:46.584]  It was memorable for me.
[00:54:46.604 --> 00:54:48.966]  It may not have been memorable for you.
[00:54:49.327 --> 00:55:01.517]  Anyways, Mr. Jones, I would like to talk very briefly about why the elitist will ultimately fail and why I think Ron Paul may well win Texas.
[00:55:02.898 --> 00:55:08.823]  Sir, I am a student of the physical, biological, and sociological sciences.
[00:55:10.177 --> 00:55:16.924]  Sir Isaac Newton gave us the equation force equals mass times acceleration.
[00:55:17.524 --> 00:55:32.159]  Now in the physical sciences, the mass is held constant in many experiments and the conjugate variables such as temperature, pressure, and entropy are varied
[00:55:34.550 --> 00:55:39.873]  So that we can see how various masses behave under different conditions.
[00:55:40.373 --> 00:55:52.160]  Now the elitists, although they may not be conscious of it, they are using that same equation and the complementary laws of thermodynamics.
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:58.523]  In my view, the elitists substitute for force
[00:55:59.910 --> 00:56:18.671]  Mass, rather than physical masses, are the people who the elitists are trying to gain control of, and they are doing that by the acceleration component of the equation, using such things as political correctness.
[00:56:19.505 --> 00:56:32.610]  They are attempting to standardize the masses, Mr. Jones, by... That's exactly, and going back to the Prussians, 200 years ago, whose design was imported here and throughout the rest of Europe and the world, that's what they want.
[00:56:32.630 --> 00:56:40.673]  They talk about us being cogs, automatons, kind of like Metropolis, or the brave new world, so they can standardize everything to control everyone.
[00:56:40.693 --> 00:56:47.196]  Yes, sir, but ultimately they will fail because of the second law of thermodynamics dealing with entropy.
[00:56:48.408 --> 00:57:14.630]  uh... says that uh... this empire uh... will eventually uh... pop like also also chaos theory and well that is related to entropy uh... chaos is a subset of uh... sir isaac's second law uh... sir uh... may i turn to a second subject i have the williamson county coordinator for the uh... uh... ron paul vote count dot com uh...
[00:57:15.830 --> 00:57:17.431]  That's trying to document the election.
[00:57:17.451 --> 00:57:20.553]  I mean, he's clearly been cheated everywhere but Nevada.
[00:57:21.273 --> 00:57:28.978]  A lot of the polls, the internal polls, show he should be getting second place everywhere, but Nevada's the only place where we didn't see the major signs of fraud.
[00:57:29.178 --> 00:57:32.980]  And I mean, it's coming out that they're giving him zero votes where he got votes.
[00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:36.842]  It's coming out that they're engaged in all forms of chicanery and have all these felons
[00:57:37.082 --> 00:57:37.662]  You're on point, sir.
[00:57:37.722 --> 00:57:40.704]  And this effort is an attempt to deal with the chicanery that you speak of.
[00:57:40.724 --> 00:57:43.066]  We're offering the voters a chance to have their votes notarized.
[00:57:43.086 --> 00:57:44.566]  We need more boots on the ground.
[00:57:44.586 --> 00:57:45.327]  You need volunteers.
[00:57:45.347 --> 00:57:45.907]  Fire them out, my friend.
[00:57:45.927 --> 00:57:46.768]  Fire them out quick.
[00:58:07.409 --> 00:58:08.650]  Sir, we need your help.
[00:58:09.410 --> 00:58:12.393]  We need men and women at the polling stations.
[00:58:12.853 --> 00:58:21.721]  Please have them go to www.RonPaulVoteCount.com.
[00:58:21.921 --> 00:58:22.521]  All right, sir.
[00:58:22.561 --> 00:58:23.522]  That's fantastic.
[00:58:24.283 --> 00:58:26.805]  And folks, you can say, well, they're going to engage in election fraud.
[00:58:26.825 --> 00:58:27.545]  We can't win.
[00:58:28.166 --> 00:58:29.707]  What's the point in watching the fraud?
[00:58:30.288 --> 00:58:34.491]  And we know there's big fraud right here in Travis and Williamson and Hayes County with the same system running it.
[00:58:35.353 --> 00:58:36.754]  In over 80% of the precincts.
[00:58:37.875 --> 00:58:38.395]  We've caught them.
[00:58:38.995 --> 00:58:46.720]  Well, just five years ago, in major polls, about 10-12%, depending on the poll, go look these up, believe it was election fraud engineered at the highest levels.
[00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:48.482]  Not voter fraud, election fraud.
[00:58:49.562 --> 00:58:58.768]  Now, in major polls, go pull this, upwards of 85% believe there is systemic, endemic, system-wide, pandemic would be the word, across-the-board fraud.
[00:58:59.108 --> 00:59:01.510]  So see, now people are angry, they're upset.
[00:59:02.364 --> 00:59:02.725]  Alright?
[00:59:02.865 --> 00:59:03.806]  So that's the first step.
[00:59:03.826 --> 00:59:05.167]  Get people convinced it's happening.
[00:59:05.207 --> 00:59:05.888]  Show them the evidence.
[00:59:06.929 --> 00:59:09.412]  Let them know there's a problem before we can set about fixing it.
[00:59:09.652 --> 00:59:14.338]  And if we just give up and say, oh, there's all this corruption, there's nothing we can do, let's give up, then they're certainly going to win.
[00:59:14.658 --> 00:59:16.800]  And people are waking up to the corrupt New World Order system.
[00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:18.142]  That is the good news, as you said, sir.
[00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:20.781]  Let's see who else has been holding the longest.
[00:59:21.541 --> 00:59:28.085]  Let's talk to Eric in San Marcos, Texas on our 590K LBJ listener, and he wants to talk about Planned Parenthood for eugenics.
[00:59:28.245 --> 00:59:29.186]  You're on the air, sir.
[00:59:29.206 --> 00:59:29.546]  Welcome.
[00:59:29.846 --> 00:59:30.667]  How's it going, Alex?
[00:59:30.687 --> 00:59:30.887]  Good.
[00:59:30.927 --> 00:59:32.228]  I went to go see you at Waterloo.
[00:59:32.328 --> 00:59:33.609]  Great, great presentation.
[00:59:34.289 --> 00:59:37.511]  I'd like to go on and tell you I was watching the Trinity Broadcast Network.
[00:59:39.581 --> 00:59:49.286]  There's a link off their website where these two individuals called Planned Parenthood and they recorded the entire conversation.
[00:59:49.306 --> 00:59:53.048]  You should be able to find it on the Trinity Broadcast Network website somewhere.
[00:59:53.108 --> 00:59:57.091]  Email it to Aaron at Infowars.com or Trey at Infowars.com so I get it.
[01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:14.740]  What happened was they asked to donate a large sum of money for a specific reason for only an abortion for an African American woman so she could have an abortion and they were all for it.
[01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:19.123]  And he even made it clear saying, oh yes, I want it because I'm afraid of affirmative action.
[01:00:19.524 --> 01:00:21.625]  And they were down for it.
[01:00:21.946 --> 01:00:34.035]  And what makes me sick to my stomach is the fact that when they go back and they want answers of why they were accepting this donation for this reason, they try to stick them with an illegal wiretapping.
[01:00:34.276 --> 01:00:36.537]  You know, it's just wrong.
[01:00:36.577 --> 01:00:37.658]  It's out wrong, man.
[01:00:37.959 --> 01:00:38.759]  Well, I hear you.
[01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:39.840]  Let me just say this.
[01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:41.602]  There's only a few states that have that law.
[01:00:41.622 --> 01:00:44.584]  If it wasn't in Connecticut or New York or a few other places, that's fraud.
[01:00:45.086 --> 01:00:48.528]  That's not illegal wiretapping, but let me just explain something here.
[01:00:49.488 --> 01:00:50.288]  It's not my opinion.
[01:00:50.328 --> 01:00:52.530]  My whole film, Endgame, is covering this.
[01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:55.431]  That's why you've got to get it, folks, at InfoWars.com.
[01:00:55.471 --> 01:00:57.732]  Get the DVD, make copies, get it out to people.
[01:00:58.192 --> 01:01:00.333]  You want the high-quality DVD and you can't afford it?
[01:01:00.433 --> 01:01:04.975]  Google Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, and watch it for free on Google Video.
[01:01:05.015 --> 01:01:05.816]  It's all over the web.
[01:01:06.176 --> 01:01:06.596]  Please!
[01:01:07.096 --> 01:01:08.817]  Spend the two hours, 20 minutes watching it.
[01:01:09.437 --> 01:01:14.200]  I mean, I made a film that cost me $150,000 to make, and I'm just saying here, it's free.
[01:01:15.495 --> 01:01:16.696]  Please, find out who these people are.
[01:01:17.416 --> 01:01:23.861]  Eugenics had the minds of over 90%, I think it's more than that, of those scientific minds.
[01:01:23.901 --> 01:01:24.601]  They believe in it.
[01:01:25.302 --> 01:01:26.863]  And that was just a few generations ago.
[01:01:26.883 --> 01:01:28.764]  That's what they're carrying out under new names.
[01:01:29.124 --> 01:01:31.006]  Margaret Sanger was a eugenicist.
[01:01:31.866 --> 01:01:36.309]  And then she's one of the top, what, 20 women, you know, in Time Magazine or whatever.
[01:01:36.349 --> 01:01:38.771]  They cover up who these people are.
[01:01:39.474 --> 01:01:40.895]  I don't think I have time to go to another call.
[01:01:40.915 --> 01:01:47.977]  We're going to come back, and I'm going to get to LeVon, Derek, Andrew, and others that are patiently holding 877-590-5525.
[01:01:49.257 --> 01:01:51.738]  Before we end this break, I keep forgetting to plug this.
[01:01:52.259 --> 01:02:00.521]  If you're a Texas listener, or even if you're in Oklahoma or New Mexico or Louisiana, I mean, it's worth it to come to this, because it's really great.
[01:02:03.102 --> 01:02:04.823]  I've never even been an official participant in it.
[01:02:05.706 --> 01:02:06.747]  I'm just always invited.
[01:02:06.868 --> 01:02:17.440]  George Norrie called me a few weeks ago, hosted the second biggest radio show in the country, that next Friday night, this coming up Friday, I'll be live with him three hours in the studio here at NewsRadio, live on a Kelby Jay nationwide.
[01:02:17.901 --> 01:02:25.010]  He invited me to spend an hour or so of time with him up on stage.
[01:02:25.732 --> 01:02:26.132]  It is a big idea.
[01:02:54.930 --> 01:02:55.952]  A new world order.
[01:02:56.693 --> 01:03:00.719]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:03:00.819 --> 01:03:04.384]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:03:04.404 --> 01:03:06.667]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:03:07.208 --> 01:03:09.572]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:03:10.365 --> 01:03:17.790]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:03:20.712 --> 01:03:25.656]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:03:26.196 --> 01:03:29.619]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:03:30.019 --> 01:03:32.561]  Bill Burdick is making great progress in the New World Order.
[01:03:32.601 --> 01:03:33.742]  Most people have no idea.
[01:03:33.762 --> 01:03:34.542]  They're not after money.
[01:03:34.562 --> 01:03:35.623]  They have all the money they need.
[01:03:35.823 --> 01:03:36.544]  They're after power.
[01:03:36.804 --> 01:03:37.605]  That's what they're after.
[01:03:37.965 --> 01:03:42.508]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[01:03:42.708 --> 01:03:46.151]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:03:46.271 --> 01:03:47.091]  Endgame.
[01:03:47.452 --> 01:03:49.013]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:03:49.473 --> 01:03:50.514]  You have been warned.
[01:03:51.343 --> 01:03:53.927]  Hi neighbor, this is Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[01:03:54.508 --> 01:03:57.131]  Life is a gamble, but you can stack the deck.
[01:03:58.033 --> 01:04:07.266]  If you knew what I know about all the problems food will protect you from, you'd start immediately to put every effort and dollar you can get into the biggest supply of food possible.
[01:04:07.961 --> 01:04:22.152]  When the dollar and economy crash, when the imported and genetically poisoned food is all that's left, when the quarantine and bird flu hit, our only protection and only chance to be fearless is having control of our own supply of food and enough of it.
[01:04:22.433 --> 01:04:30.099]  But if you knew what we haven't yet discovered, you wouldn't waste time listening to the rest of this announcement before charging out and getting a serious food supply.
[01:04:30.119 --> 01:04:33.481]  Decide, it's food now or probably never.
[01:04:33.882 --> 01:04:35.143]  But can you afford to be wrong?
[01:04:35.823 --> 01:04:36.523]  Decide now.
[01:04:37.004 --> 01:04:37.784]  Place your bet.
[01:04:38.564 --> 01:04:40.045]  Can you afford to be wrong?
[01:04:40.425 --> 01:04:41.806]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[01:04:41.826 --> 01:04:41.986]  Call 800-409-5633.
[01:04:52.538 --> 01:04:53.498]  Ted Anders from Midas.
[01:04:53.538 --> 01:04:53.919]  January 18, 2008.
[01:04:53.999 --> 01:04:54.920]  Gold 880.80.
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:05:01.945]  Old school coins can be purchased for 906.58, 446.60 per half, 223.30 per quarter.
[01:05:02.126 --> 01:05:04.568]  That's 906.58, 446.60, and 223.30.
[01:05:04.608 --> 01:05:09.351]  For years, Ron Paul has taken the position to uphold constitutional rights.
[01:05:09.652 --> 01:05:13.855]  He's been branded by special interest groups as doctrinal, refusing to bend his values.
[01:05:14.236 --> 01:05:18.179]  I can only imagine the pressure applied by Congress as he stands alone for these principles.
[01:05:18.579 --> 01:05:20.400]  He has given up a medical career for this.
[01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:22.621]  Ron Paul is running for president.
[01:05:22.861 --> 01:05:28.864]  The ideas of strong currency, ending the war, defending the Constitution, and protecting civil liberties are catching on.
[01:05:29.124 --> 01:05:35.907]  As a thank you, GCNlive.com, Midas Resources, and I would like to send you a free copy of the Ron Paul Family Cookbook.
[01:05:36.247 --> 01:05:37.028]  Call 800-686-2237 for your free copy.
[01:05:40.149 --> 01:05:42.734]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[01:05:43.596 --> 01:05:46.681]  I hope his values are touching your heart as deep as they are mine.
[01:05:46.822 --> 01:05:47.142]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:05:47.202 --> 01:05:48.805]  Thanks again for supporting Ron Paul.
[01:05:51.977 --> 01:05:52.638]  It's a fact.
[01:05:52.858 --> 01:06:00.343]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[01:06:00.443 --> 01:06:09.329]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:20.136]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:06:20.396 --> 01:06:26.461]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[01:06:26.661 --> 01:06:31.705]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[01:06:31.886 --> 01:06:36.369]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[01:06:36.529 --> 01:06:38.331]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[01:06:38.351 --> 01:06:38.571]  That's 877-943-8600.
[01:06:38.611 --> 01:06:39.071]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[01:06:39.191 --> 01:06:41.053]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[01:06:48.459 --> 01:06:51.241]  It is quite a circus in here today.
[01:06:51.261 --> 01:06:59.026]  We got into the hot lights, Independent Film Channel, documentary filmmakers, the guys that won the South by Southwest Award for Darkon.
[01:07:15.996 --> 01:07:20.800]  Are here with us in studio and follow me around off and on for what, six months or so?
[01:07:21.721 --> 01:07:28.787]  We also have, coming up in the next three or four months, a Discovery Channel piece, a full hour on the wicked Alex Jones.
[01:07:29.667 --> 01:07:32.970]  And I am holding my breath to see what happens there.
[01:07:33.270 --> 01:07:36.213]  Doesn't matter what people say or do though, I think these guys are good here.
[01:07:37.113 --> 01:07:42.738]  Because it just makes folks check out what I'm actually saying, what I'm actually doing, what we're actually discussing, and then they wake up.
[01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:46.362]  Some words about Ron Paul and election fraud.
[01:07:46.442 --> 01:07:50.185]  Coming up on the 29th, you're going to have the Florida primary.
[01:07:50.825 --> 01:07:51.105]  What is it?
[01:07:51.145 --> 01:07:52.106]  The third largest state.
[01:07:52.126 --> 01:07:53.347]  It goes to the most delegates.
[01:07:53.407 --> 01:07:54.067]  California.
[01:07:54.087 --> 01:07:56.249]  And of course, Texas.
[01:07:57.050 --> 01:07:58.130]  And Florida, then New York.
[01:07:59.211 --> 01:08:02.534]  And I think you're going to see more election fraud there against Ron Paul.
[01:08:02.794 --> 01:08:06.957]  I mean, if he gets half the votes at the poll show he's getting, it's a fraud.
[01:08:07.537 --> 01:08:08.958]  Again, he got second place.
[01:08:09.779 --> 01:08:12.861]  Second place Friday in Nevada.
[01:08:13.917 --> 01:08:14.737]  And guess what happened?
[01:08:16.678 --> 01:08:17.599]  I watched Fox.
[01:08:17.699 --> 01:08:18.499]  I watched CNN.
[01:08:18.579 --> 01:08:19.540]  No one reported on it.
[01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:21.161]  They just said McCain got second place.
[01:08:22.161 --> 01:08:23.222]  Absolutely amazing.
[01:08:23.262 --> 01:08:24.783]  Look into it for yourself.
[01:08:24.803 --> 01:08:25.783]  You're asking, how can that be?
[01:08:25.803 --> 01:08:27.924]  He tied with McCain.
[01:08:29.345 --> 01:08:37.309]  I think he got 15 point something, actually, above McCain, and McCain got a few percentage points under him.
[01:08:37.329 --> 01:08:38.530]  Where is that here?
[01:08:38.550 --> 01:08:41.311]  I've got an article, 15 point something, and Paul got 15 point something.
[01:08:42.324 --> 01:08:43.245]  I know Paul won.
[01:08:43.265 --> 01:08:43.826]  It doesn't matter.
[01:08:43.846 --> 01:08:45.528]  It doesn't matter if you win in this rigged game.
[01:08:45.548 --> 01:08:48.291]  It doesn't matter if you beat that little creature.
[01:08:48.892 --> 01:08:51.756]  That gun-grabbing, open-bordered, loving, New World Order piece of trash.
[01:08:52.256 --> 01:08:55.220]  Have you noticed how both parties are circling the wagons against the people?
[01:08:55.240 --> 01:09:01.828]  Talking about how they're working together to save the economy and help you and take good care of you because they love you so much.
[01:09:03.287 --> 01:09:07.071]  I want everyone to understand, I just want you to think they're doing something about the economy.
[01:09:07.111 --> 01:09:18.001]  Exactly what the establishment wanted to happen from the IMF, the World Bank documents that we have, the banking documents we have, is what is now unfolding and it's going to get very, very, very bad.
[01:09:18.842 --> 01:09:23.006]  The people that got gold, you could be looking at $2,000 gold in the next year.
[01:09:23.707 --> 01:09:25.508]  It's already gone up from $300 to $900 plus, as we told you it would.
[01:09:27.694 --> 01:09:28.414]  But don't listen to us.
[01:09:28.454 --> 01:09:32.217]  There's paid liars that I'm sure will be glad to give you a bunch of bulls.
[01:09:32.237 --> 01:09:33.077]  You can just listen to them.
[01:09:33.297 --> 01:09:36.079]  Don't listen to people that have incredible track records of accuracy.
[01:09:36.799 --> 01:09:38.020]  Let's talk to LeVon.
[01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:40.681]  LeVon in the San Francisco Bay Area.
[01:09:41.862 --> 01:09:44.443]  And it says LeVon is 16 years old.
[01:09:44.483 --> 01:09:49.586]  We don't screen your calls, but if you volunteer what you're calling about, they'll put it on the computer screen here for me.
[01:09:49.606 --> 01:09:50.927]  By the way, if you disagree with me, 877-590-5525.
[01:09:50.947 --> 01:09:51.727]  LeVon, you're on the air.
[01:09:51.747 --> 01:09:52.368]  Thanks for holding.
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:56.280]  Hi Alex.
[01:09:56.861 --> 01:09:57.241]  Hi.
[01:09:57.841 --> 01:10:02.164]  I've been doing this for about three years, and I've been doing this since I was like 12 or 13.
[01:10:02.204 --> 01:10:05.366]  You mean doing this, finding out about the New World Order?
[01:10:05.387 --> 01:10:10.810]  Finding out about the New World Order, eugenics, and I was amazed to see when your movie came out.
[01:10:10.850 --> 01:10:11.851]  I've seen all your movies.
[01:10:11.911 --> 01:10:17.455]  A lot of the things I saw before your movies, and then when you came out with the movies, I was amazed.
[01:10:19.972 --> 01:10:20.913]  It's in my community.
[01:10:20.953 --> 01:10:27.321]  Things like, um, they have this UN youth organization in my school and the kids are just dumbed down.
[01:10:27.361 --> 01:10:28.563]  They don't know what's going on.
[01:10:31.551 --> 01:10:44.873]  They're literally, we are Homo Sapiens Sapiens, we're primates, and the elite openly say that, and they treat us like animals, it's humans that are into how humans operate, but they use it for evil, and then they've trained us to be gibbering monkeys.
[01:10:45.173 --> 01:10:49.714]  The general public, I watch them, who aren't aware, are literally gibbering monkeys.
[01:10:50.214 --> 01:11:00.596]  And I bring them the evidence, I show them that, okay, this is what it's about, this is what's going to happen, the dollar's going down, my history teachers aren't even aware of this.
[01:11:01.931 --> 01:11:04.131]  They don't know what the doll... They don't understand currency.
[01:11:04.151 --> 01:11:05.672]  They don't understand value.
[01:11:05.952 --> 01:11:10.153]  I know the basic things that our grandfathers and great-grandfathers and mothers knew.
[01:11:10.353 --> 01:11:11.853]  Basic knowledge.
[01:11:11.873 --> 01:11:15.914]  Look, one-fifth of Americans, and they have these surveys every year of university students, but also of adults.
[01:11:16.474 --> 01:11:19.334]  One-fifth of Americans can't find the U.S.
[01:11:19.434 --> 01:11:19.854]  on a map.
[01:11:20.614 --> 01:11:20.974]  Okay?
[01:11:22.035 --> 01:11:27.656]  Eighty-plus percent of, what, sophomore college students, they had a survey two years ago, didn't know who the vice president was.
[01:11:28.116 --> 01:11:29.416]  But they know how to act cool.
[01:11:30.265 --> 01:11:32.286]  They know how to look at them wrong and start a fight with you.
[01:11:32.626 --> 01:11:33.947]  They know how to snicker and call.
[01:11:33.967 --> 01:11:37.769]  If you say, the government's corrupt, they just snicker and go, that doesn't exist.
[01:11:38.810 --> 01:11:39.950]  But you're out there, my friend.
[01:11:41.211 --> 01:11:43.132]  But listen, people are waking up.
[01:11:43.192 --> 01:11:44.493]  Positive things are happening.
[01:11:44.533 --> 01:11:45.833]  People are starting to see the big picture.
[01:11:46.254 --> 01:11:47.314]  And we're planting seeds.
[01:11:47.834 --> 01:11:52.417]  And as things get worse and worse, as more and more of what we said comes true, people are going to remember that.
[01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:56.141]  They're going to see films I made 10, 11 years ago.
[01:11:56.161 --> 01:11:58.262]  They're going to see TV shows I did 13 years ago.
[01:11:58.282 --> 01:12:02.384]  They're going to see what a lot of other patriots and truth-tellers and alternative media said and did.
[01:12:03.485 --> 01:12:05.086]  And our stocks are going to continue to rise.
[01:12:06.246 --> 01:12:06.586]  Okay?
[01:12:07.227 --> 01:12:17.131]  And there's a lot of people in the system who aren't evil, a lot of powerful, wealthy people who aren't corrupt, who aren't in the controlling corridors, but are also in those circles.
[01:12:17.191 --> 01:12:17.992]  And they're very upset.
[01:12:18.032 --> 01:12:18.632]  I've talked to them.
[01:12:19.491 --> 01:12:20.592]  I mean, I've talked to billionaires.
[01:12:20.652 --> 01:12:22.473]  I've talked to retired four-star generals.
[01:12:22.593 --> 01:12:27.036]  I've talked to people you wouldn't believe off-record, because they know I know how to keep my mouth shut.
[01:12:27.296 --> 01:12:28.557]  People say stuff's off the record.
[01:12:28.877 --> 01:12:30.058]  They're completely freaked out.
[01:12:30.138 --> 01:12:30.639]  I mean, listen.
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:44.228]  Tons of the Hollywood elite are building emergency relocation places for their families in Singapore and the Cook Islands, in New Zealand, in Costa Rica.
[01:12:44.848 --> 01:12:47.670]  I mean, Schwarzenegger, Gibson, they're all fleeing there.
[01:12:48.132 --> 01:12:50.856]  Gibson's got my films and watches them.
[01:12:52.058 --> 01:12:55.062]  They've got jets fueled, ready for their families to get out.
[01:12:55.502 --> 01:12:57.044]  The analogy is the U.S.
[01:12:57.425 --> 01:13:03.093]  was a great palace, and now the elite is out on the front lawn grabbing onto helicopter skids as they take off.
[01:13:03.313 --> 01:13:04.535]  Ever seen the fall of Saigon?
[01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:22.311]  You know, in the early 70s when we were leaving, mid 70s, and there's the images of the troops and the people literally hanging off helicopter skids, and the elite is just, they set up the system, they sucked us dry, and the billionaires, how many people are worth a billion bucks, six billion bucks, people I know,
[01:13:23.091 --> 01:13:24.793]  People I know who represent wealthy people.
[01:13:25.093 --> 01:13:26.174]  I mean, I mean real wealth.
[01:13:26.414 --> 01:13:27.976]  I mean, they are totally freaked.
[01:13:28.016 --> 01:13:29.097]  They've got bodyguards.
[01:13:29.277 --> 01:13:31.218]  They've got weapons caches offshore.
[01:13:31.419 --> 01:13:32.800]  They've got barbed wire fences.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.262]  They've got people with machine guns ready to protect them.
[01:13:35.642 --> 01:13:36.083]  They know.
[01:13:36.923 --> 01:13:37.984]  And they're begging the elite.
[01:13:38.004 --> 01:13:41.167]  There's people throughout the strata, throughout the World Bank, IMF, British U.S.
[01:13:41.227 --> 01:13:44.590]  government, intelligence agencies, FBI, saying, don't do it!
[01:13:44.890 --> 01:13:46.492]  Don't set off nukes in the U.S.
[01:13:46.512 --> 01:13:47.933]  Don't blame it on Al-Qaeda.
[01:13:48.213 --> 01:13:49.634]  Don't bring in the New World Order.
[01:13:49.914 --> 01:13:50.455]  Don't do it.
[01:13:51.823 --> 01:13:52.764]  Well, I'm not a billionaire.
[01:13:52.864 --> 01:13:53.544]  I'm not a millionaire.
[01:13:53.885 --> 01:13:54.825]  I don't have anywhere to go.
[01:13:55.126 --> 01:13:56.427]  This is all I've got in this country.
[01:13:56.647 --> 01:13:57.628]  I'm going down with a ship.
[01:13:57.948 --> 01:13:59.449]  And the ship's literally on its side.
[01:13:59.489 --> 01:14:00.009]  It's smoking.
[01:14:00.029 --> 01:14:00.670]  It's on fire.
[01:14:00.970 --> 01:14:06.094]  And you've got all these pansy, mainline, arrogant, self-centered people going, We love it.
[01:14:06.254 --> 01:14:07.115]  There's no corruption.
[01:14:07.675 --> 01:14:09.717]  I mean, I watched television last night for about an hour.
[01:14:10.712 --> 01:14:19.035]  In Dallas, we were doing shoots there for JFK film I'm making with the fellow that wrote the screenplay for JFK, their main consultant, Jim Mars, and also E. Howard Hunt's firstborn son, St.
[01:14:19.055 --> 01:14:24.896]  John Hunt, cover of Rolling Stone Magazine about what we always knew him confessing to being part of the killing Kennedy, the government.
[01:14:25.737 --> 01:14:28.798]  And after the shoot, after three days of shooting, I went in and collapsed.
[01:14:28.818 --> 01:14:29.998]  We're in a room eating ice cream.
[01:14:30.038 --> 01:14:39.661]  I'm watching television, and I was flipping through every channel, and it was more and more insane and mentally ill and just mindless and decadent and stupid.
[01:14:41.425 --> 01:14:43.026]  I mean, we're babes to the slaughter here.
[01:14:43.046 --> 01:14:45.347]  If I have time to jam in one more call?
[01:14:45.367 --> 01:14:47.447]  Before we go to break?
[01:14:48.608 --> 01:14:50.068]  Can't even see my producer in there, do I?
[01:14:52.549 --> 01:14:53.049]  That's strange.
[01:14:54.010 --> 01:14:54.830]  I guess he doesn't hear me in there.
[01:14:54.850 --> 01:14:55.770]  Do we have time to go to another call?
[01:14:56.811 --> 01:14:57.031]  We do?
[01:14:57.111 --> 01:14:58.391]  Okay.
[01:14:58.552 --> 01:15:03.053]  Let's go ahead and... See, I got a different clock during the week, a different clock here, and I forget the clock.
[01:15:03.914 --> 01:15:06.935]  Let's go ahead and talk to Andrew in Wisconsin.
[01:15:07.015 --> 01:15:07.735]  Andrew, you're on the air.
[01:15:08.755 --> 01:15:09.796]  Hey, Mr. Jones?
[01:15:09.956 --> 01:15:10.216]  Yes, sir.
[01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:17.552]  Yeah, I've been trying to get on for a couple times, but I know... You know, I actually shouldn't have gone to your call.
[01:15:17.572 --> 01:15:19.853]  I'm going to come right back to you, okay?
[01:15:20.593 --> 01:15:21.374]  Stay there, Andrew.
[01:15:21.734 --> 01:15:22.394]  Stay there, Derek.
[01:15:22.714 --> 01:15:23.855]  Everybody else, stay right there.
[01:15:23.875 --> 01:15:26.776]  We'll come back to you after this quick break.
[01:15:27.256 --> 01:15:30.657]  Get into them staging the Iran situation, trying to start World War III a few weeks ago.
[01:15:30.677 --> 01:15:32.198]  That's now admitted to have been staged.
[01:15:32.598 --> 01:15:37.860]  And a lot more, the website for TruthNews.us, PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com.
[01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:38.480]  We'll be back.
[01:15:40.534 --> 01:15:41.095]  I think so.
[01:15:52.094 --> 01:15:53.395]  Hi Ken, it's Judy again.
[01:15:53.415 --> 01:15:57.939]  I just wanted to call you back and let you know how thankful Mike and I are for your working with us.
[01:15:58.099 --> 01:16:01.241]  You know the Sun Oven we ordered from you on KenSolar.com?
[01:16:01.461 --> 01:16:05.685]  It cooks all of our food and then some, plus we just sold the old gas barbecue.
[01:16:05.885 --> 01:16:11.969]  Also, the solar-powered generator reduced our electric bill just like you said it would, and it's powering my whole studio right now.
[01:16:12.190 --> 01:16:17.474]  We don't have to worry about our food going bad or surviving the outages anymore, either of which is huge.
[01:16:17.754 --> 01:16:20.616]  Well Ken, I'll cut this one short for now, and thanks again.

[01:18:06.791 --> 01:18:08.893]  The government doesn't want the best for you.
[01:18:09.253 --> 01:18:14.577]  They keep you down, they keep you blue, they starve your body for all its nutrients.
[01:18:16.594 --> 01:18:18.714]  They won't let you grow industrial hemp.
[01:18:19.055 --> 01:18:24.436]  It really doesn't make any kind of sense when it's so healthy for the world and useful for you, my friends.
[01:18:26.336 --> 01:18:30.877]  I hope Mr. Bush will hear this song, for the heart of America wants this one.

[01:20:09.918 --> 01:20:10.638]  We're back live.
[01:20:10.838 --> 01:20:12.019]  Sorry about that caller.
[01:20:12.199 --> 01:20:14.400]  Let's go back to Andrew in Wisconsin.
[01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:16.681]  Let him finish up what he was saying.
[01:20:17.261 --> 01:20:18.141]  You're on the air, sir.
[01:20:19.121 --> 01:20:27.665]  Yeah, Alex, you know, I just, I don't know if it's the dumbing down, if that's a correct phrase, of society, or if it starts in high school.
[01:20:27.805 --> 01:20:28.845]  It's the distracting.
[01:20:28.905 --> 01:20:31.326]  It's the destruction of the language, the shrinking of the language.
[01:20:31.646 --> 01:20:33.567]  It's the sodium and stannous fluoride in the water.
[01:20:33.607 --> 01:20:33.927]  Go ahead.
[01:20:34.327 --> 01:20:38.749]  It seems like it starts, you know, with the brainwashing in high school with
[01:20:39.818 --> 01:20:42.299]  Not giving you the truth, you know what I'm saying?
[01:20:42.339 --> 01:20:47.441]  And then it goes on to college, and then it goes into the yuppies where they sit in their cubicles.
[01:20:48.721 --> 01:20:56.524]  And it just seems like, and I don't know if it's the baby boomers, I don't want to go negative and say it's the Vietnam vets when it came back.
[01:20:56.804 --> 01:20:59.845]  It's the entire society who's had it so good so long.
[01:21:00.225 --> 01:21:03.046]  They stopped being involved in society and everything fell apart.
[01:21:03.666 --> 01:21:04.346]  It's true.
[01:21:04.406 --> 01:21:07.067]  My father is similar to your viewpoint.
[01:21:07.107 --> 01:21:08.828]  When I was young, he would talk about
[01:21:09.329 --> 01:21:17.271]  When I was 6 or something, 26, when I was 6, he would say, uh, watch when the government comes to your house to wipe your butt, you know what I'm saying?
[01:21:17.811 --> 01:21:19.591]  Uh, stuff, crazy stuff like that, you know what I mean?
[01:21:19.631 --> 01:21:20.332]  Yeah, to help you.
[01:21:20.912 --> 01:21:22.672]  To come wipe your butt, you know what I mean?
[01:21:22.692 --> 01:21:24.633]  That's how it's gonna be when they're gonna, you know what I mean?
[01:21:24.893 --> 01:21:35.315]  It's overtaking, I work 50 hours like you're saying, and I, when I was younger, you know, you're supposed to work 50 hours to have a house, and it isn't happening anymore, you know what I mean?
[01:21:35.925 --> 01:21:37.147]  No, you're absolutely right.
[01:21:37.747 --> 01:21:39.349]  Look, the elite doesn't care about you.
[01:21:39.810 --> 01:21:45.857]  In fact, they're disgusted with the population, but they've helped turn the population into what it is, by and large, as a generalization.
[01:21:46.698 --> 01:21:49.442]  And people better know it's a very serious world.
[01:21:49.802 --> 01:21:51.905]  The veneer of civilization is very, very thin.
[01:21:53.427 --> 01:21:55.790]  And we have some very very wicked people running our society.
[01:21:56.151 --> 01:21:57.793]  Let's go to another caller.
[01:21:57.833 --> 01:21:59.596]  Let's talk to Derek in Canada.
[01:21:59.876 --> 01:22:00.497]  You're on the air.
[01:22:00.517 --> 01:22:01.178]  Thank you for holding.
[01:22:01.198 --> 01:22:02.660]  Hey, thanks for having me on.
[01:22:03.241 --> 01:22:08.128]  In regards to the immigration problem that you guys are having down in the United States,
[01:22:08.769 --> 01:22:13.252]  I think it's important to note that it's not something that's just inherent to the United States.
[01:22:13.352 --> 01:22:26.141]  All of Europe, by design and official government policies, including Canada and North America, is being overrun by design by the third world to drive down wages and destroy the middle class, the historical enemy of the ruling elite.
[01:22:26.561 --> 01:22:28.483]  That's right, and we have a similar problem up here.
[01:22:28.823 --> 01:22:34.307]  However, the only fundamental difference is that in Canada they're unbelievably overt about it.
[01:22:35.047 --> 01:22:53.912]  Just for example the Moncton City Council of New Brunswick President is going over to South Korea and holding these massive seminars spending millions of dollars of tax dollars or money to convince these people to migrate here so that they can fill jobs that they're not going to be able to fill because people are not having kids.
[01:22:54.092 --> 01:22:59.354]  There's a massive exodus out west where people can find better jobs and the only
[01:23:00.825 --> 01:23:04.748]  Reasoning, I can see why they would want to do that, is to drag down the wages.
[01:23:05.048 --> 01:23:06.209]  They don't want to pay a fair wage.
[01:23:06.549 --> 01:23:09.271]  Absolutely, it's the elite waging war on the population.
[01:23:09.471 --> 01:23:11.553]  Excellent point, because they're monopoly men.
[01:23:11.573 --> 01:23:16.877]  In a free market, you want to protect your nation, build it up, but this is not a, quote, free market.
[01:23:16.897 --> 01:23:18.658]  It's a monopoly market.
[01:23:19.099 --> 01:23:22.601]  In a nationalistic free market, it is the opposite.
[01:23:22.861 --> 01:23:25.303]  Let's talk to Tony in Pennsylvania.
[01:23:26.064 --> 01:23:27.365]  You're on the air, Tony.
[01:23:27.465 --> 01:23:27.865]  Welcome.
[01:23:28.926 --> 01:23:29.807]  Good evening, Mr. Jones.
[01:23:30.931 --> 01:23:31.051]  Hi.
[01:23:31.512 --> 01:23:37.356]  Just a reminder, if you could remind your listeners to leave the NRA and go with the GOA.
[01:23:37.477 --> 01:23:37.717]  That's right.
[01:23:37.737 --> 01:23:39.959]  The NRA is a pro-gun control group.
[01:23:40.219 --> 01:23:42.701]  They have sponsored every major gun control bill that has passed.
[01:23:43.001 --> 01:23:46.304]  The 1968 Gun Control Act, the Brady Bill in 1993.
[01:23:46.664 --> 01:23:49.527]  They have supported the 2000 NICS expansion.
[01:23:49.727 --> 01:23:52.349]  They have now supported the Veterans and Police Disarmament Act.
[01:23:53.431 --> 01:23:54.432]  Yes, sir, they have.
[01:23:55.353 --> 01:24:05.000]  I joined the GOA last week and I intend to stick with them, but just as a side note, I'd like to let you know that you're freaking out all of my friends.
[01:24:06.161 --> 01:24:13.426]  I've started making copies of Endgame and sending them to all my friends on DVD, and they keep coming to me going,
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:16.681]  How did this all happen all of a sudden?
[01:24:16.981 --> 01:24:20.744]  It hasn't been all of a sudden, it's been happening for decades.
[01:24:21.384 --> 01:24:27.908]  We show the last 200 years of history, starting with Napoleon on, the first of the film explains all of it.
[01:24:28.788 --> 01:24:38.354]  Right, well I understand that, but I've been referring them to your website, and when they start seeing Police State, and they start seeing your other videos, it just freaks them out.
[01:24:39.075 --> 01:24:41.456]  But are they waking up, or are they going back on their turtle shell?
[01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:44.344]  They're waking up, but slowly.
[01:24:45.366 --> 01:24:46.088]  Well, good job.
[01:24:46.128 --> 01:24:47.411]  They're waking up very slowly.
[01:24:48.362 --> 01:24:54.747]  Well, it's shocking to learn that the NRA has great members, wonderful people, but that it was founded for gun control, is run by gun control.
[01:24:54.787 --> 01:24:59.590]  Gunners of America, second largest Second Amendment group in the country, and really the only large Second Amendment group.
[01:25:00.210 --> 01:25:03.473]  It's not the Judas Coat, not the Benedict Arnold, not the wolves in sheep's clothing.
[01:25:03.713 --> 01:25:09.357]  When they find out the NRA and the globalists weren't going to get our guns without controlling the so-called pro-gun group.
[01:25:09.597 --> 01:25:11.638]  And that's what they've done, and that's how they fooled the population.
[01:25:12.319 --> 01:25:16.362]  Let's go ahead now and talk to James in Los Angeles.
[01:25:16.762 --> 01:25:17.903]  James, you're on the air.
[01:25:18.363 --> 01:25:19.644]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[01:25:19.684 --> 01:25:25.929]  You know, I've just been turned on to your program in the last couple of weeks because a big Ron Paul supporter and a friend of mine here in L.A.
[01:25:25.949 --> 01:25:29.692]  told me to listen, and I've been doing it, and I think you've been doing a heck of a job with that.
[01:25:29.712 --> 01:25:40.280]  There's a couple of things I disagree with you on that I completely agree with you, like I just mentioned about Ron Paul and your economic assertions, and you had the Bob Chapman on recently, who was excellent as well.
[01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:48.345]  The only thing I wanted to get through to you, though, on 9-11, I don't know if you ever saw my exchange with Lee Hamilton of the 9-11 Commission.
[01:25:48.585 --> 01:25:56.109]  If you go to representativepress.blogspot.com, you'll see a link there on the upper left.
[01:25:56.530 --> 01:25:57.110]  It's a video.
[01:25:57.330 --> 01:25:59.531]  Lee Hamilton of the 9-11 Whitewash Commission.
[01:25:59.551 --> 01:26:05.255]  Yeah, yeah, but Alex, seriously, I mean, you've got somebody here who agrees with you in many areas, and it's not a hostile call, okay?
[01:26:05.935 --> 01:26:06.876]  Hold on, let me just stop you.
[01:26:08.008 --> 01:26:10.149]  A lot of listeners don't know who Lee Hamilton is.
[01:26:10.649 --> 01:26:12.469]  I'm going to put you on hold for just a minute.
[01:26:13.189 --> 01:26:16.090]  That's what they would do on any talk show or C-SPAN.
[01:26:16.530 --> 01:26:24.592]  If a caller calls into C-SPAN and they've got a guest on and they say the name of a government official or someone on a commission, I just stated who he was.
[01:26:25.393 --> 01:26:29.494]  So he was on the 9-11 Commission, appointed by Bush, they call independent, appointed by Bush.
[01:26:30.474 --> 01:26:34.695]  So that's why I just put you on hold.
[01:26:35.399 --> 01:26:37.840]  And I think he hung up after I put him on hold.
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:42.300]  Sir, if you want to call back and get back in, you might have thought I hung up on you when I put you on hold.
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:43.121]  You were talking over me.
[01:26:43.141 --> 01:26:44.101]  I wanted to finish my point.
[01:26:44.361 --> 01:26:46.861]  See, I'm not bad because I just said who that was.
[01:26:47.322 --> 01:26:55.103]  A lot of people listening, driving down the road in Tennessee or Texas or New York or Southern California, they don't know who we were talking about.
[01:26:55.603 --> 01:26:55.923]  Okay?
[01:26:56.683 --> 01:26:59.024]  Let's go ahead and talk to Paula.
[01:27:00.237 --> 01:27:02.178]  We just lost Paul's call.
[01:27:02.438 --> 01:27:04.899]  Let's go ahead and talk to Sam in Cedar Park.
[01:27:04.939 --> 01:27:06.620]  That's basically Austin, Texas.
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:07.320]  You're on the air, sir.
[01:27:08.241 --> 01:27:12.483]  Yeah, Alex, I wondered if you'd ever heard of the term, the dark side of the coin?
[01:27:13.623 --> 01:27:13.864]  No.
[01:27:15.484 --> 01:27:20.267]  I met a man that said that he kind of worked for the dark side of the coin, as he put it.
[01:27:21.007 --> 01:27:27.970]  He said he actually didn't even work for an agency of the government, but he was over there in Europe in the 1950s, the mid-50s.
[01:27:30.527 --> 01:27:33.909]  And he got a hold of this book called Greater Germany and World Events.
[01:27:34.049 --> 01:27:35.010]  Are you familiar with that?
[01:27:36.751 --> 01:27:37.031]  No.
[01:27:39.252 --> 01:27:50.199]  It was a leather bound book with all sorts of photography from Heiner Hoffman, Hitler's personal confidant.
[01:27:52.695 --> 01:27:55.597]  The historians don't know about this book yet.
[01:27:55.617 --> 01:27:58.739]  He said he got one from Germany and brought it back and he showed it to me.
[01:27:58.820 --> 01:27:59.640]  It's just amazing.
[01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:06.565]  It's got captions under each photo and a summary at the end of each month's photos of what was done.
[01:28:06.645 --> 01:28:09.227]  But the basic title is, you know, Greater Germany and World Events.
[01:28:09.267 --> 01:28:10.788]  It's all in German Gothic script.
[01:28:12.149 --> 01:28:13.870]  And it's from the Ministry of Propaganda.
[01:28:13.890 --> 01:28:19.975]  And I just thought I'd bounce that off of you because I think it's a fabulous book.
[01:28:19.995 --> 01:28:21.335]  Well, what's the basic premise?
[01:28:21.376 --> 01:28:21.876]  What's it say?
[01:28:22.486 --> 01:28:23.327]  I don't know what it says.
[01:28:23.407 --> 01:28:31.333]  It's German Gothic script and I don't read German, but I do know that we looked and we found another one in Germany that they sent to us.
[01:28:32.053 --> 01:28:33.795]  And, you know, it's got weird photos in it.
[01:28:33.835 --> 01:28:40.960]  Like, it's got a map of Europe, how Europe was going to be divided up when they got rid of Germany.
[01:28:40.980 --> 01:28:48.246]  It had photos of maps that the Germans discovered how, basically, England had
[01:28:49.228 --> 01:28:49.728]  Absolutely.
[01:28:49.748 --> 01:28:51.889]  I mean, I really can't comment on a book that I haven't read.
[01:28:51.909 --> 01:28:53.450]  I know the historical fact is that
[01:29:18.152 --> 01:29:27.339]  Lord Milner in England, by the twenties, wanted to set up a dictator in Germany, have Germany then destroy Europe, and then England could then come in and dominate Europe.
[01:29:27.359 --> 01:29:32.303]  And by England, the Anglo-American establishment that did indeed do all of that.
[01:29:33.334 --> 01:29:36.856]  Continuing with your very interesting phone calls, taking us in so many different directions.
[01:29:37.296 --> 01:29:46.342]  On the other side of this quick break, again, the website is R-TruthNews.us, and I'm going to be at TalkFest here in Austin, the Austin Convention Center, next Saturday.

[01:29:52.350 --> 01:29:52.870]  Hi, neighbor.
[01:29:53.210 --> 01:29:58.733]  No matter when the time comes to survive on our food supply, every single one of us who have prepared will have two regrets.
[01:29:59.353 --> 01:30:05.076]  Even those who haven't wasted a single penny on Christmas, birthdays, and vacations in order to store all the food possible.
[01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:09.081]  Even those who have sold stuff and taken on part-time jobs to buy food.
[01:30:09.742 --> 01:30:13.023]  Even those who have traded their gold while it will still buy food.
[01:30:13.623 --> 01:30:17.005]  Yes, we will have been called stupid, crazy, and foolish.
[01:30:17.605 --> 01:30:22.127]  When folks won't be able to afford food and there won't be any food for any amount of money.
[01:30:22.847 --> 01:30:24.828]  We will still have two regrets.
[01:30:25.468 --> 01:30:28.809]  We will regret that we didn't get more serious about more food sooner.
[01:30:29.490 --> 01:30:32.351]  We will deeply regret that we didn't get enough food.
[01:30:33.146 --> 01:30:40.015]  Putting off emergency food preparations to celebrate the holidays will be the most dangerous decision that some of us will ever make.
[01:30:40.035 --> 01:30:41.036]  Call 800-409-5633.
[01:30:41.117 --> 01:30:42.158]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[01:30:42.178 --> 01:30:42.218]  800-409-5633.
[01:30:51.565 --> 01:30:52.226]  It's a fact.
[01:30:52.446 --> 01:30:59.931]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[01:31:00.051 --> 01:31:08.917]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[01:31:09.177 --> 01:31:19.724]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:31:19.984 --> 01:31:26.047]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[01:31:26.267 --> 01:31:31.290]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[01:31:31.470 --> 01:31:35.952]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[01:31:36.112 --> 01:31:37.913]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.

[01:32:02.328 --> 01:32:03.589]  The joy of relaxation.
[01:32:03.749 --> 01:32:08.653]  Few people realize how much benefit the ionic cleansing can be to remove toxins from your body.

[01:32:54.474 --> 01:33:01.157]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:33:01.418 --> 01:33:09.582]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[01:33:49.462 --> 01:33:57.348]  News, politics, sports, cars, home improvement, health, and everything in between.
[01:33:57.528 --> 01:33:58.408]  We've got you covered.
[01:33:58.508 --> 01:34:00.330]  You're listening to the GCN Radio Network.
[01:34:07.066 --> 01:34:17.376]  Coming to you live from deep in the heart of Texas, I'm Alex Jones, your host, blasting out across the nation and the internet worldwide.
[01:34:17.396 --> 01:34:23.843]  All right, let me hit one final news story and then I'm going to go right to four or five final calls.
[01:34:24.503 --> 01:34:28.227]  Jay and James and others from around the country that are patiently holding
[01:34:29.893 --> 01:34:45.399]  Remember three weeks ago, the Iranian patrol boat supposedly came out in their tiny blue motorboats, their jet boats, and threatened the giant destroyer's task force that were going into the Persian Gulf.
[01:34:46.479 --> 01:34:48.220]  And Bush said this could be war.
[01:34:48.300 --> 01:34:50.280]  The media was saying this is unbelievable evil.
[01:34:50.940 --> 01:34:52.181]  We've never seen such evil.
[01:34:53.323 --> 01:34:57.188]  Except when our own government blew up two of their passenger liners and keeps bombing their ships over the years.
[01:34:57.208 --> 01:34:57.848]  You didn't know about that?
[01:34:58.149 --> 01:35:06.618]  Second biggest naval engagement since midway in World War II was in what, what was it, 1991 after the Gulf War.
[01:35:06.638 --> 01:35:09.281]  They blew up a bunch of the Iranian ships, sunk some of their battleships.
[01:35:10.042 --> 01:35:11.384]  I'm claiming something like this happened too.
[01:35:12.031 --> 01:35:18.894]  And then the tapes finally got released, and it was the Iranians doing their regular... I mean, this happens with the Coast Guard on our coast.
[01:35:18.914 --> 01:35:21.175]  When you come right up on the edge of their waters, they come out and say, identify.
[01:35:21.215 --> 01:35:22.155]  And our ships say, identify.
[01:35:22.175 --> 01:35:24.216]  And those tapes were brought out, and they were being polite.
[01:35:24.236 --> 01:35:27.518]  And our captains and people on board the ships were being polite.
[01:35:28.118 --> 01:35:33.481]  And they said, okay, somebody was joking, and it wasn't the Iranians, it's somebody all the ships know.
[01:35:34.362 --> 01:35:40.245]  It's a radio pirate who likes to pop on and make jokes.
[01:35:40.505 --> 01:35:42.046]  You know, the fake Persian accent.
[01:35:42.406 --> 01:35:44.427]  We are going to blow you up in one minute!
[01:35:45.648 --> 01:35:50.551]  And we told you day one it was fake, and now it's in the Asia Times, it's now come out in several major U.S.
[01:35:50.591 --> 01:35:51.191]  newspapers.
[01:35:51.952 --> 01:35:56.054]  Steve Watson for Infowars.net wrote a really important report you should go read.
[01:35:56.826 --> 01:36:07.669]  Remember what Ron Paul said, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts said, I said, so many others said they would try to stage a gulp of Tonkin there to get a war going, claiming some of our ships have been attacked, and then exactly that.
[01:36:08.129 --> 01:36:17.371]  Garth Porter, a journalist who previously wrote a story regarding a secret Iranian peace overture to the Bush administration in 2006, writing for the Asia Times, states that the event was hyped up
[01:36:17.871 --> 01:36:24.294]  In a major incident after the original press release described the event as somewhat routine and did not refer to any threat to explode U.S.
[01:36:24.314 --> 01:36:26.254]  ships or any similar confrontation.
[01:36:26.554 --> 01:36:32.857]  And you better believe that was the CIA or another unnamed intelligence agency coming over that line saying, we're going to blow you up.
[01:36:33.417 --> 01:36:36.819]  And now the people on both the ships are saying, yeah, somebody pops in and says that all the time.
[01:36:37.199 --> 01:36:39.239]  And we've, you know, triangulated where it's coming from.
[01:36:39.299 --> 01:36:40.480]  It's not coming out of Iran.
[01:36:41.195 --> 01:36:50.464]  And the Iranians are smart enough now to have video cameras all over their boats, all over their shoreline, and there was even video of them on the walkie-talkies, and, I mean, on the radios, and then the U.S.
[01:36:50.484 --> 01:36:51.946]  had to admit, okay, they didn't threaten us.
[01:36:52.687 --> 01:36:56.030]  And the boats were, uh, like a half a mile away behind them.
[01:36:56.550 --> 01:37:03.657]  I mean, tiny little five-man boats driving around with giant missile cruisers and jets and helicopters flying overhead.
[01:37:03.918 --> 01:37:04.939]  Oh, they're gonna get us!
[01:37:06.678 --> 01:37:07.678]  This is just incredible.
[01:37:08.118 --> 01:37:09.339]  Okay, James in L.A.
[01:37:09.439 --> 01:37:10.479]  actually got disconnected.
[01:37:10.819 --> 01:37:14.840]  He had a point he wanted to make about talking to one of the people on the 9-11 Commission.
[01:37:15.540 --> 01:37:16.440]  James, go ahead.
[01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:16.980]  Sorry about that.
[01:37:17.300 --> 01:37:17.800]  Hi, Alex.
[01:37:17.820 --> 01:37:20.081]  Listen, that was just one point I wanted to make.
[01:37:20.141 --> 01:37:27.502]  I had it out with Lee Hamilton, but I want to get to the issue of Iran and the USS Liberty and McCain and talk about other issues that I'm sure we agree on as well.
[01:37:27.822 --> 01:37:28.082]  Go ahead.
[01:37:28.102 --> 01:37:28.702]  You've got the floor.
[01:37:29.183 --> 01:37:29.643]  Sounds good.
[01:37:32.103 --> 01:37:35.064]  What happened with what you just mentioned in the Strait of Hormuz?
[01:37:35.365 --> 01:37:37.125]  Yeah, that's like a Gulf of Tonkin, too.
[01:37:37.185 --> 01:37:46.829]  I mean, you've got the USS Liberty attack back in 1967, and what I wanted to mention about that is here we have Israel basically treacherously attacking our ship.
[01:37:46.849 --> 01:37:49.210]  You can go to USSLiberty.com to check that out.
[01:37:49.230 --> 01:37:52.991]  I'm a friend of Captain Ward in Boston, but you might want to have on your program as well.
[01:37:53.111 --> 01:37:54.212]  I have interviewed him three times.
[01:37:54.392 --> 01:38:00.634]  Yeah, well, we should really nail McCain with this, because I was on C-SPAN right before... And it was his father, the Admiral, that helped cover it up.
[01:38:00.934 --> 01:38:10.637]  Well, yeah, Isaac, you know, Isaac Kidd, he worked for him, did three, like, naval court of inquiries for him, and what happened is McCain's father, just like you mentioned, helped to cover it up.
[01:38:10.877 --> 01:38:20.659]  And here we have McCain selling himself as a patriotic American when he's been selling out to the Israelis, not only with the USS Liberty attack, but also with the war in Iraq.
[01:38:20.679 --> 01:38:22.500]  That was all for the pro-Israel lobby, Alex.
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:26.581]  You can look at the Walton Mershheimer book, you know, the U.S.
[01:38:26.601 --> 01:38:27.261]  foreign policy.
[01:38:27.601 --> 01:38:28.562]  It's Israel Lobby and U.S.
[01:38:28.582 --> 01:38:29.202]  Foreign Policy.
[01:38:29.222 --> 01:38:31.483]  Just go to IsraelLobbyBook.com and check that out.
[01:38:31.983 --> 01:38:33.604]  And there's a media blackout on that too.
[01:38:33.644 --> 01:38:35.045]  I tried to get 60 minutes to do it.
[01:38:35.345 --> 01:38:38.306]  Got an email back from the executive office and they're saying, no we won't do it.
[01:38:38.326 --> 01:38:40.027]  And that was a month before the book came out.
[01:38:40.307 --> 01:38:42.869]  Yet I was able to get it out on the BBC internationally.
[01:38:43.249 --> 01:38:46.971]  The problem in our country, as you've been addressing as well, is the media blackout.
[01:38:47.331 --> 01:38:50.092]  Look what we have to deal with regarding that with Ron Paul.
[01:38:50.693 --> 01:38:51.273]  Another issue.
[01:38:51.713 --> 01:38:53.514]  Let's get a campaign against McCain.
[01:38:53.834 --> 01:38:54.934]  I mean, look what they did to Kerry.
[01:38:54.954 --> 01:38:55.955]  I didn't like Kerry at all.
[01:38:55.995 --> 01:38:58.316]  He was strummin', playin' guitar with... Exactly.
[01:38:58.356 --> 01:39:00.036]  I mean, they can't just stage the election.
[01:39:00.056 --> 01:39:04.198]  They have to have a fall guy or a guy with a glass jaw to take a dive like Kerry.
[01:39:04.238 --> 01:39:05.078]  Both parties are bought.
[01:39:05.118 --> 01:39:08.220]  That's how they control it, so... But, look.
[01:39:09.460 --> 01:39:11.961]  On the situation of the USS Liberty, 1967, during the Six-Day War,
[01:39:14.514 --> 01:39:32.293]  It is true that Israel, for more than two and a half hours, with patrol boats firing .50 caliber and larger cannons, and torpedoes, and Desant Misery bombers, and Mirage fighter-bombers, did attack the ship.
[01:39:32.313 --> 01:39:33.754]  And then the ship called for help.
[01:39:33.815 --> 01:39:35.016]  It wasn't even in Israeli waters.
[01:39:35.792 --> 01:39:48.183]  And now the Israeli pilots have gone public saying they were ordered to attack it, they knew it was an American ship, that's in Israeli papers, and the Chicago Tribune reported the NSA is now releasing intercepts, and it has been declassified, the Israeli intercepts, the U.S.
[01:39:48.223 --> 01:39:50.625]  intercepted, where they said attack the American ship, sink it.
[01:39:51.506 --> 01:40:02.235]  And then you can debate all day why they did it, but the more important fact is, they've now released the transcripts, and I've interviewed the admirals, I've interviewed the captain before he died, I've interviewed Ward Boston, the judge advocate general,
[01:40:02.862 --> 01:40:05.963]  He was a captain at the time, then became a general and ran that investigation.
[01:40:06.403 --> 01:40:19.567]  They were ordered to stand down, and that LBJ, when the admirals, 100 miles away, launched jets in the MED, and they were ordered to turn those jets back, and the admirals said, no, I want to hear from the President.
[01:40:20.267 --> 01:40:26.349]  They told McNamara over the phone, I've talked to multiple people who heard this up in the conning towers, I mean, admirals.
[01:40:28.766 --> 01:40:33.550]  I talked to the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Moore, went public about this.
[01:40:33.770 --> 01:40:34.691]  I guess he's bad too, though.
[01:40:34.771 --> 01:40:35.612]  Admiral Thomas Moore.
[01:40:35.952 --> 01:40:37.013]  He just died a few years ago.
[01:40:37.113 --> 01:40:37.573]  Great man.
[01:40:37.593 --> 01:40:42.998]  And LBJ came on the phone and said, that ship, you know, I don't care if that GD ship goes to the bottom.
[01:40:43.078 --> 01:40:43.518]  No help.
[01:40:43.598 --> 01:40:44.419]  Recall the aircraft.
[01:40:44.839 --> 01:40:46.160]  And then people said that wasn't true.
[01:40:46.180 --> 01:40:47.842]  Well, now the NSA intercepts have been released.
[01:40:48.182 --> 01:40:57.490]  And the evidence we've got, and what the survivors believe, Congressional Medal of Honor winners, by the way, some of the most highly decorated ship in USA history, you didn't know that, folks, was that
[01:40:58.746 --> 01:41:04.089]  They were trying to sink the ship to blame it on Egypt as a false flag.
[01:41:04.149 --> 01:41:12.254]  It looks like our government was involved because it was an intelligence ship and the executive branch had that ship parked out there and was in collusion to do that.
[01:41:12.954 --> 01:41:14.295]  It's very, very horrible.
[01:41:15.636 --> 01:41:17.977]  My point is that all governments do this.
[01:41:18.892 --> 01:41:24.817]  And so, you know, we get into an Israel bashing fest, instead of just intellectually going, yes, Israel stages terror attacks.
[01:41:25.117 --> 01:41:25.878]  It's been in Herat.
[01:41:25.938 --> 01:41:27.099]  It's been in Jerusalem Post.
[01:41:27.339 --> 01:41:28.600]  They created fake Al-Qaeda groups.
[01:41:28.620 --> 01:41:29.461]  Just type that into Google.
[01:41:29.501 --> 01:41:34.545]  Israel created fake Al-Qaeda groups to bomb Israeli cities, to get their people to go along with the police state.
[01:41:35.146 --> 01:41:35.946]  Our government does it.
[01:41:36.006 --> 01:41:36.847]  The Germans do it.
[01:41:36.927 --> 01:41:37.668]  The British do it.
[01:41:37.728 --> 01:41:38.588]  The Italians do it.
[01:41:38.648 --> 01:41:39.529]  The Japanese do it.
[01:41:39.769 --> 01:41:40.630]  The Chinese do it.
[01:41:40.970 --> 01:41:42.832]  And this is a favorite tactic of government.
[01:41:43.542 --> 01:41:44.643]  And you're absolutely right, sir.
[01:41:45.504 --> 01:41:46.965]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jay.
[01:41:47.085 --> 01:41:49.107]  Jay, you're on the air from New York.
[01:41:50.328 --> 01:41:51.368]  Okay, he's got his radio up.
[01:41:51.408 --> 01:41:51.729]  Go ahead.
[01:41:51.749 --> 01:41:57.373]  I'm going to have to let him go, and I don't think we're going to take any more calls, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:57.393 --> 01:41:59.035]  We've only got about two minutes left.
[01:41:59.115 --> 01:42:09.143]  I know we have listeners all over the country and the world, but if you're blessed to live in Texas, God bless Texas, George Norrie invited me to be in studios with him here in town.
[01:42:10.624 --> 01:42:16.786]  His station here that broadcasts in Austin is the station we transmit out of to syndicate around the country and the world.
[01:42:17.126 --> 01:42:19.006]  It's News Radio 590 KLBJ.
[01:42:19.467 --> 01:42:20.827]  And they've got TalkFest.
[01:42:21.187 --> 01:42:22.147]  It's coming up that Saturday.
[01:42:22.167 --> 01:42:23.288]  He'll be here in town Friday.
[01:42:23.728 --> 01:42:26.769]  I'm going to be in studio with him on the nationwide broadcast for three hours.
[01:42:26.789 --> 01:42:27.749]  I'm really honored to do that.
[01:42:28.529 --> 01:42:32.410]  I'm always honored when they, the last three years in a row, have invited me to that.
[01:42:32.750 --> 01:42:34.591]  And then he invited me again to be at TalkFest.
[01:42:35.391 --> 01:42:38.452]  So I'm not sure how much I'll be up on stage with him.
[01:42:39.159 --> 01:42:41.420]  I really could care less one way or the other.
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:42.380]  It sounds like a lot of fun.
[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:44.181]  I like seeing the people out there at the event.
[01:42:44.221 --> 01:42:50.723]  The big deal is I'll be in studio with him here at the station going out nationwide coming up next Friday night into Saturday morning.
[01:42:50.743 --> 01:42:51.843]  So definitely want to tune in for that.
[01:42:52.103 --> 01:42:54.164]  And you can meet George Norrie at TalkFest.
[01:42:54.444 --> 01:42:56.105]  That's with the Austin Convention Center.
[01:42:56.125 --> 01:42:57.045]  Really nice facility.
[01:42:57.525 --> 01:43:00.106]  And there's going to be all the local hosts and some other national hosts.
[01:43:00.966 --> 01:43:02.166]  John Dromgoole is really interesting.
[01:43:02.206 --> 01:43:06.628]  Pat Robertson, Cheryl McLaughlin, Patrick Tempone, Carl Stewart.
[01:43:07.602 --> 01:43:11.784]  I bet Kenny Romire, Jeff Ward, there's a lot of people there.
[01:43:11.824 --> 01:43:12.864]  It's a free event.

[01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:19.401]  Pacific.
[01:44:20.001 --> 01:44:22.822]  And of course the weekday show, 11 to 2 Central Standard Time.

[01:44:27.184 --> 01:44:28.805]  Great job to Trey Kincaid running the show.
[01:44:28.825 --> 01:44:33.726]  I want to say hi as well and thanks for the great help in here with the Independent Film Channel folks.
[01:44:33.766 --> 01:44:34.087]  Take care.
[01:44:42.345 --> 01:44:43.385]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:44:43.485 --> 01:44:48.307]  Over the years, Genesis Communications Network has grown by leaps and bounds, reaching millions of listeners.
[01:44:48.407 --> 01:44:51.308]  The impact on political and social issues have been enormous.
[01:44:51.428 --> 01:44:55.450]  Businesses associated with the network have grown to become valuable enterprises.
[01:44:55.750 --> 01:45:01.772]  If you are accredited and have an entrepreneurial spirit, national radio may be the opportunity you're looking for.

[01:45:16.026 --> 01:45:17.947]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[01:45:18.648 --> 01:45:21.830]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[01:45:22.470 --> 01:45:28.915]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
