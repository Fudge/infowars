[00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:01.890]  In studio with us for the next 52 minutes is George Butler.
[00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:06.114]  I might even keep it a little bit longer when Peter Schiff
[00:00:22.646 --> 00:00:29.752]  One of Ron Paul's top financial advisors, market advisors, joins us in the fourth hour today.
[00:00:29.812 --> 00:00:35.156]  I will continue with calls later in this hour on The Economy at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:00:36.277 --> 00:00:40.340]  We are streaming live right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.623]  That will also be archived for PrisonPlanet.tv members as it is each and every day.
[00:00:45.504 --> 00:00:52.848]  Don't forget we have the free podcast now for about a year and a half at InfoWars.com with a whole show every day to your MP3 or iPod.
[00:00:53.388 --> 00:01:00.572]  Now with over 80,000 people downloading that a day and growing, so that is also exciting.
[00:01:01.312 --> 00:01:05.356]  I wanted to go back to Ted Anderson just briefly.
[00:01:05.576 --> 00:01:10.700]  Ted, I wanted to get your comment on the financial terrorism with the Federal Reserve.
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.946]  Ted Anderson, of course, at Minus Resources, watching the metals commodity markets closely there on the inside of it.
[00:01:18.747 --> 00:01:20.108]  I mean, this was so clear.
[00:01:20.188 --> 00:01:21.389]  Terrorizing the public.
[00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:23.651]  The Congress saying, if you don't pass this, there'll be a depression.
[00:01:23.972 --> 00:01:25.813]  They say no Monday, four days ago.
[00:01:26.173 --> 00:01:26.694]  It plunges.
[00:01:27.674 --> 00:01:30.516]  $1,200,000,000 in one day, terrorizing the public.
[00:01:30.876 --> 00:01:39.300]  The President's Plunge Protection Team didn't prop it up that day, and then the public still isn't acquiescing, but the Senate passes it, the House set to pass it today or tomorrow.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.161]  Ted Anderson, your take on that?
[00:01:41.621 --> 00:01:44.222]  Oh yeah, and it probably will pass tomorrow.
[00:01:44.262 --> 00:01:50.125]  When it does, just hold on to your hat, because there's going to be so much new currency coming into the system through that Federal Reserve System.
[00:01:50.225 --> 00:01:52.226]  All that money is being printed from thin air.
[00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.600]  And to bail out the, you know, who are they bailing out?
[00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.001]  They're bailing out the member banks that have the risk here.
[00:01:59.321 --> 00:02:09.945]  They're basically saying, one more gash into the taxpayer to solve... Yeah, they know it's going down, and they're going to set up a world banking system with world laws out of that.
[00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:15.047]  Again, they pose the crisis, then they pose as the saviors and offer the false solution.
[00:02:15.547 --> 00:02:22.430]  Alex, a world banking system would be the ultimate way to collect labor from the entire world.
[00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.073]  And they've been doing that to us here in the United States since 1913.
[00:02:28.313 --> 00:02:31.475]  And it's just crazy that we let this come along in the first place.
[00:02:31.495 --> 00:02:32.515]  Well, that's what the New Order is.
[00:02:32.575 --> 00:02:41.740]  It is a global corporate takeover of the world's energy supplies, finance, the food systems, everything.
[00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.041]  It's the biggest form of serfdom there is out there.
[00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:46.602]  We will become their slaves.
[00:02:46.642 --> 00:02:50.904]  We'll be working for them, and they will produce nothing, and we'll be turning over our production.
[00:02:50.924 --> 00:02:51.884]  Well, here's the bad news.
[00:02:51.924 --> 00:02:56.466]  There's not enough gold and silver for the general public of the West to protect themselves.
[00:02:58.667 --> 00:03:23.295]  The good news is, because we can't help that, the good news is at least our listeners and people that are informed know that they still have time to get into gold and silver and other metals before it's too late because once the people find out about hyperinflation that's already with us but going to compound now, there won't be enough gold and silver and the price will be so high most people aren't going to be able to afford it because we're going to have a depression
[00:03:23.755 --> 00:03:29.218]  And a deflation in jobs and the amount of money people can get at the same time while prices are going up.
[00:03:29.598 --> 00:03:30.478]  Stagflation.
[00:03:30.678 --> 00:03:32.359]  So, stag hyperinflation.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.521]  Stagflation was invented by the bankers in the seventies.
[00:03:36.001 --> 00:03:38.362]  I guess we have to call this stag hyperinflation.
[00:03:38.682 --> 00:03:40.463]  I can't think of a worse scenario, Ted.
[00:03:40.523 --> 00:03:44.105]  Yeah, you've got joblessness right now and you also have printing of money.
[00:03:44.165 --> 00:03:45.445]  The two of them goes together.
[00:03:45.645 --> 00:03:50.248]  You're going to have price inflation and unemployment is going to go up at the same time.
[00:03:50.588 --> 00:03:51.268]  That's crazy.
[00:03:51.288 --> 00:03:52.789]  I mean, the people are just straddled.
[00:03:53.129 --> 00:04:00.814]  The people that are getting hurt the worst are the people that have been saving all their lives, entering into the retirement age, and they're not going to have any value left in their currency.
[00:04:00.855 --> 00:04:03.817]  And what, are they going to go to Social Security?
[00:04:04.097 --> 00:04:05.378]  There's not enough money there.
[00:04:06.138 --> 00:04:11.302]  They dope the figures, they're not going to... But not just that, they won't even pay you for the cost of living increase from inflation.
[00:04:11.562 --> 00:04:16.283]  No, they won't, because they'll go off the CPI, and the CPI is a doped-up figure that's not even real.
[00:04:16.403 --> 00:04:17.303]  Everybody knows that.
[00:04:17.803 --> 00:04:18.064]  All right.
[00:04:18.084 --> 00:04:23.945]  Well, Ted Anderson, again, I bet in five minutes you've already sold out of those buffaloes.
[00:04:24.645 --> 00:04:26.085]  I would call right away.
[00:04:26.105 --> 00:04:31.126]  If you're interested in those buffaloes, I would call right now, because there is definitely not a lot of that to go around.
[00:04:32.007 --> 00:04:34.687]  Also, right now, you're talking about that creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:04:34.707 --> 00:04:35.227]  That book is $19.95.
[00:04:35.868 --> 00:04:37.528]  You get the silver dollar for free.
[00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:42.393]  Right now you're paying $20 for silver dollars, so it's a great buy.
[00:04:42.413 --> 00:04:44.255]  800-686-2237.
[00:04:44.595 --> 00:04:50.580]  And to get that, tell them Alex Jones and Ted Anderson sent you 1-800-686-2237.
[00:04:50.941 --> 00:04:52.882]  Folks, it's a win-win-win-win-win.
[00:04:53.303 --> 00:05:01.430]  And the margins here are so small, but it supports the network, makes this show possible, lets Ted hire more board ops, he just got an even better star guide.
[00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.952]  We're switching over to that in a month.
[00:05:05.192 --> 00:05:07.933]  We have both Star Guide feeds going right now.
[00:05:08.674 --> 00:05:12.035]  It allows you to get gold and silver at incredibly good prices.
[00:05:12.496 --> 00:05:13.916]  Win, win, win, win, win.
[00:05:13.956 --> 00:05:19.619]  Because Ted buys when the market's going down, so when the market's going up, he can pass on those discounts to you.
[00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:23.761]  And you can get the Creature from Jekyll Island that I know sells for like $24 in bookstores.
[00:05:24.001 --> 00:05:27.183]  Ted's selling it for $19.95, and you get a free silver dollar.
[00:05:27.463 --> 00:05:28.884]  You can't get silver dollars.
[00:05:29.304 --> 00:05:33.265]  For below $20, so that is basically a free silver dollar.
[00:05:33.505 --> 00:05:36.346]  You cannot beat that!
[00:05:36.366 --> 00:05:39.367]  $19.95 for this creature from Jekyll Island, the history of the banking system.
[00:05:39.727 --> 00:05:42.428]  You may know all about it, but your neighbors, your friends, your family don't.
[00:05:42.648 --> 00:05:47.289]  So you get the book to give to somebody, read it yourself, and then give it away, and you get the silver dollar.
[00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.530]  You get a free silver dollar.
[00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.651]  I don't know how you're offering that, Ted.
[00:05:51.671 --> 00:05:54.492]  $800, may not after this show, with me plugging this.
[00:05:54.512 --> 00:05:54.952]  800-686-2237.
[00:05:54.972 --> 00:05:56.272]  Ted, thanks for coming on.
[00:05:59.013 --> 00:06:00.154]  Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[00:06:00.554 --> 00:06:00.895]  You bet.
[00:06:00.995 --> 00:06:06.620]  Okay, shifting gears, and I'm going to keep you a little bit in with Ship if you've got some questions to George Butler.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.504]  George Butler has a Saturday evening show here on Genesis, and I've known George for years.
[00:06:12.144 --> 00:06:18.049]  George Butler, so much is happening, so much is going on, but you're also a long-time real estate agent.
[00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:22.874]  I know you're involved in brokerage as well, because you brokered a deal on another office we leased.
[00:06:24.255 --> 00:06:25.356]  So, I want to talk about
[00:06:25.916 --> 00:06:44.142]  You know, the overarching banking infrastructure, but then the real economy on Main Street, Austin, the supposedly wealthiest per capita city in the country, the best city to live in, rated the last four years consecutively, still the best, but we see restaurants I've gone to for years are closing.
[00:06:44.442 --> 00:06:47.383]  My wife went to the mall yesterday to get some prescription glasses.
[00:06:48.203 --> 00:06:49.163]  No one was at the mall.
[00:06:49.203 --> 00:06:50.664]  It's usually jam-packed at that time.
[00:06:51.444 --> 00:06:53.965]  We're seeing, I mean, in this city, supposedly the best,
[00:06:55.806 --> 00:06:58.128]  I know some other real estate agents, and they say the market's dropped about 20%.
[00:06:58.168 --> 00:07:05.255]  The media isn't really covering that, but they said in the Jumbo loan and the Million Dollar Houses, which are four bedrooms in this town, the price has gone up.
[00:07:05.816 --> 00:07:11.301]  People are refusing to sell, and they're refusing to lower their price, but nothing's selling for months.
[00:07:11.602 --> 00:07:14.745]  So I want to talk about Main Street as well from your perspective.
[00:07:14.765 --> 00:07:15.866]  George Butler, good to have you here.
[00:07:17.037 --> 00:07:20.318]  Alex, you invited me here today.
[00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:25.420]  Main Street is being affected in a way that was predicted by many.
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.282]  I think you predicted some of this, along with Ted and others over the years.
[00:07:29.302 --> 00:07:29.962]  I didn't predict it.
[00:07:29.982 --> 00:07:31.803]  The bankers said they were going to do it to us.
[00:07:31.963 --> 00:07:32.943]  I just said, oh, the enemy's
[00:07:34.004 --> 00:07:42.009]  You started announcing it early on, though, that we would be put into some kind of a depression or some kind of a severe recession.
[00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:44.931]  And so you were at the forefront with other people.
[00:07:45.331 --> 00:07:49.514]  But we're seeing now that credit lines are being audited by some of the largest banks.
[00:07:50.415 --> 00:07:52.776]  Chase themselves are auditing out in El Paso.
[00:07:52.796 --> 00:07:54.277]  I have some contacts out there.
[00:07:54.818 --> 00:08:00.982]  And they got back and they said, well, the loan would be two or three weeks later than possibly they could make right now.
[00:08:01.042 --> 00:08:03.003]  So they are stalling on some of our loans right now.
[00:08:04.144 --> 00:08:06.888]  I mean, we see the credit markets shutting down to a great extent.
[00:08:07.348 --> 00:08:10.192]  Yes, the mortgage loans in Austin, Texas.
[00:08:10.252 --> 00:08:13.136]  Austin has been an exception to the rule up until now.
[00:08:13.496 --> 00:08:21.987]  And I've noticed in the last three to four weeks, I've been getting all three to five times as many emails from realtors, and everyone is reducing prices right now.
[00:08:22.367 --> 00:08:35.655]  Now, that figure you threw out earlier, the 20 percent or so forth, we saw a reduction over the last year of 20 to 30 percent, not in prices, but in reduction of sales themselves.
[00:08:35.855 --> 00:08:38.917]  We saw a rise of about the same amount in number of listings.
[00:08:39.257 --> 00:08:45.981]  We saw a decrease in sales themselves of that much, but the price has not been weakened until just recently.
[00:08:46.241 --> 00:08:51.905]  We've seen in the last three to four weeks, prices coming down more so than we've ever seen before.
[00:08:53.263 --> 00:08:53.983]  And you're a realtor.
[00:08:54.003 --> 00:08:56.224]  Keep breaking down those numbers for people, what that means.
[00:08:56.304 --> 00:09:01.766]  And supposedly the best city in the country for real estate and business, we're seeing a sudden plunge.
[00:09:01.886 --> 00:09:09.828]  Yeah, when Austin started being affected, and that's what I'm saying in the last month, I would say, we were starting to really be affected.
[00:09:10.309 --> 00:09:15.950]  And the million dollar houses and so forth were first affected when we first went into this over a year ago.
[00:09:16.531 --> 00:09:20.772]  And now we're seeing it move into hundred thousand, two hundred thousand dollar houses
[00:09:21.533 --> 00:09:28.582]  We're getting emails daily, five to ten emails from different realtors saying, reduced here, increase of commission here and so forth.
[00:09:28.923 --> 00:09:36.393]  And so it's having an effect right now in probably one of the premier real estate markets in the country, which is Austin, Texas.
[00:09:37.605 --> 00:09:38.546]  What does that mean to you?
[00:09:39.226 --> 00:09:43.628]  Well, we're going to see, we've been, I've been through this tight, we call it a tight money period.
[00:09:44.069 --> 00:09:47.651]  And that means credit is going to be not easy to get.
[00:09:47.731 --> 00:09:53.014]  We rely on some well-heeled private investor to make some of our loans.
[00:09:53.594 --> 00:09:57.917]  So we're outside the normal mortgage market in some of our transactions.
[00:09:58.337 --> 00:10:03.100]  And so we do take some of our mortgage business and sales to private individuals.
[00:10:04.116 --> 00:10:10.458]  That's one way to deal in a market like this without depending on the existing, the traditional credit lines.
[00:10:12.639 --> 00:10:28.844]  Now, going from Main Street to the larger perspective, give us your perspective, you know, living a while, seeing markets go up and down, similarities with this market to old downtimes, and then anything different you're seeing this time.
[00:10:29.608 --> 00:10:31.731]  Well, here is different.
[00:10:32.092 --> 00:10:40.065]  I think the financial terrorism, which y'all have set out very well in detail, is something I've never seen before.
[00:10:41.281 --> 00:10:51.690]  We've had doubt declines before and recessions and so forth before, but we've never had these pronouncements, especially by the President, when the President started threatening about pension funds and things like that.
[00:10:52.110 --> 00:11:05.662]  Now, one of the precursors to this was about a year ago, a main investment manager, I think it might have been Goldman Sachs or one of those companies out of New York, approached our teacher's retirement pension fund.
[00:11:06.223 --> 00:11:17.183]  And it was about in April of 2007 that they decided to give that investment company $30 billion out of the Texas Teacher Retirement Fund.
[00:11:18.685 --> 00:11:23.851]  And the article, the way they portrayed the investments, they said these would be more risky types of investments.
[00:11:24.211 --> 00:11:29.817]  And I'm sure that they meant derivative types of investments that they invested.
[00:11:29.857 --> 00:11:30.598]  That's right.
[00:11:30.638 --> 00:11:33.862]  We've had looting of state and federal and private pensions.
[00:11:33.882 --> 00:11:36.445]  We've had them change the laws so companies can do that.
[00:11:36.765 --> 00:11:39.208]  And so you've also had a quiet shift into that area.
[00:11:39.574 --> 00:11:52.100]  Well, Mark to Model is what they've been using to estimate a future value of a derivative, and they're using an algorithm, and they can concoct any algorithm they want to project into the future.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.701]  Enron was using the same technique.
[00:11:53.721 --> 00:11:54.622]  Well, let's talk about that.
[00:11:54.662 --> 00:12:02.145]  What's the public going to do when they learn that it isn't just the bailouts, that they've already sucked your police, firemen, school teacher pensions dry?
[00:12:02.686 --> 00:12:03.186]  Stay with us.
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.820]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:12:06.941 --> 00:12:12.082]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:12:12.102 --> 00:12:13.642]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:12:13.902 --> 00:12:22.084]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:12:22.304 --> 00:12:28.026]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:12:28.206 --> 00:12:29.987]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:12:30.048 --> 00:12:32.209]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:12:32.229 --> 00:12:36.593]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:12:36.773 --> 00:12:38.895]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[00:13:05.245 --> 00:13:08.306]  Do you want to pay for the government bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?
[00:13:08.526 --> 00:13:09.786]  You may have no choice.
[00:13:10.486 --> 00:13:13.287]  Obviously, taxpayers are on the hook for over six trillion.
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:17.483]  That's right, trillion dollars in mortgages held by these two corporations.
[00:13:18.223 --> 00:13:25.009]  The part that most people don't realize is that this bailout can have significant adverse effects on their 401ks and IRAs.
[00:13:25.849 --> 00:13:30.573]  Unless you're planning to help pay for this bailout with your personal retirement funds, you need to act now.
[00:13:31.053 --> 00:13:34.416]  The solution is to fund a self-directed IRA with gold and silver.

[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:10.262]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[00:14:10.542 --> 00:14:15.344]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[00:14:15.584 --> 00:14:20.546]  Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[00:14:20.767 --> 00:14:24.188]  This product is a one of a kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[00:14:24.688 --> 00:14:32.852]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[00:14:33.192 --> 00:14:38.154]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[00:14:38.994 --> 00:14:44.737]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[00:14:44.977 --> 00:14:47.298]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[00:14:47.578 --> 00:14:49.999]  ...cannot survive in an alkaline environment.

[00:15:03.444 --> 00:15:07.526]  ...a day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[00:15:07.626 --> 00:15:10.727]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:15:11.087 --> 00:15:12.748]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:14.781]  But who is the enemy?
[00:15:15.261 --> 00:15:15.802]  Bin Laden.
[00:15:16.062 --> 00:15:17.063]  This is his M.O.
[00:15:17.083 --> 00:15:18.364]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:15:18.404 --> 00:15:20.066]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:15:20.426 --> 00:15:27.193]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:28.033]  Some U.S.
[00:15:28.073 --> 00:15:33.739]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:15:34.399 --> 00:15:37.862]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:15:37.882 --> 00:15:40.064]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:16:07.637 --> 00:16:10.099]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:16:10.119 --> 00:16:10.640]  to 3 p.m.
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:16.465]  We're here live and we restream the show for 20 hours till we're back live at InfoWars.com.
[00:16:16.485 --> 00:16:20.009]  If you're listening to us on an AM or FM station, those are wonderful affiliates.
[00:16:20.029 --> 00:16:26.315]  Support their sponsors and tell people at Red Lights, the grocery store, at church about the local station.
[00:16:26.335 --> 00:16:30.899]  Whether they carry us live during the day or rear us at night or both or carry the show on the weekend.
[00:16:30.959 --> 00:16:32.420]  I have a lot of affiliates that do that as well.
[00:16:33.061 --> 00:16:39.862]  Be sure and support those sponsors, ladies and gentlemen, because they are solid gold in the fight against the New World Order to really reach people.
[00:16:40.482 --> 00:16:42.463]  There's a lot of ways we are reaching out.
[00:16:42.543 --> 00:16:49.744]  George Butler is a real estate agent, also a broker, and he has been working in it for a long time.
[00:16:49.764 --> 00:16:54.125]  We were getting into pensions, and that's a whole area I haven't really gotten into during all this.
[00:16:54.165 --> 00:17:00.586]  They have already sucked those dry, come in and paid off local politicians, put that into their banking system, and leveraged it out
[00:17:01.326 --> 00:17:06.207]  And I mean, any way you cut it, it's going to be a depression or a mega-depression.
[00:17:06.568 --> 00:17:07.728]  On the good end, a depression.
[00:17:08.068 --> 00:17:09.388]  On the bad end, a mega-depression.
[00:17:09.408 --> 00:17:10.269]  They're calling in U.S.
[00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:11.729]  military against the American people.
[00:17:12.289 --> 00:17:13.910]  I mean, I can't believe this is even happening.
[00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:18.671]  I mean, I intellectually knew they were setting up for it, George, but to see it unfolding...
[00:17:19.011 --> 00:17:19.992]  Continue with the pensions.
[00:17:20.372 --> 00:17:22.213]  This is a prime example here.
[00:17:22.253 --> 00:17:26.916]  The teacher retirement system takes a hit on Lehman Brothers' stock holdings.
[00:17:27.256 --> 00:17:31.278]  This was reported in our local American Statesman by the staff.
[00:17:31.359 --> 00:17:33.340]  Robert Elder wrote this article.
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:34.621]  U.S.
[00:17:34.641 --> 00:17:43.586]  Securities and Exchange Commission filings show that the retirement system ramped up its holdings starting in March when Lehman's stock was trading near $50 per share.
[00:17:43.866 --> 00:17:46.448]  At the time, the system held about one million shares.
[00:17:47.148 --> 00:17:53.293]  The retirement system then went on a buying spree, raising its stake to 4.3 million shares by June 30th.
[00:17:53.694 --> 00:17:59.098]  During those four months, however, Lehman stock fell below $20 per share, a 60% drop.
[00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:08.126]  They are hustling these retirement funds into the hundreds of millions of dollars, and in some cases billions, they stand to lose.
[00:18:08.942 --> 00:18:10.903]  And that's all over the country and all over the world.
[00:18:10.923 --> 00:18:18.807]  This is just right here in Austin, Texas, and this is, teachers' retirement should be raising hell about how these funds have been invested on their behalf.
[00:18:18.827 --> 00:18:23.770]  Remember about... They got into risky, too risky investments because the derivative thing needed to be fed.
[00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:31.214]  Remember Orange County alone, five years ago, when hundreds of millions of dollars got sucked out and they found it was, quote, risky investments, they were derivatives?
[00:18:31.714 --> 00:18:36.617]  Again, that's why they then started sucking other pension funds dry, was to try to pump that bubble up.
[00:18:37.737 --> 00:18:39.278]  And no amount of pumping will fix it.
[00:18:39.378 --> 00:18:43.280]  All it will do is steal your investments and devalue your currency.
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:44.281]  Exactly.
[00:18:44.341 --> 00:18:47.502]  What they've done is use this mark-to-model accounting method.
[00:18:47.762 --> 00:18:56.387]  Now that is one thing I think in this bill that they're trying to get back to a mark-to-market system of accounting versus a mark-to-model.
[00:18:56.627 --> 00:19:02.670]  The mark-to-model enabled these pension funds, I mean these investment funds and mutual funds and Lehman Brothers and so forth,
[00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:06.353]  Now, while we talk about what's happening in the international banking centers,
[00:19:19.623 --> 00:19:23.924]  You know, the finance markets and the finance economy.
[00:19:24.344 --> 00:19:29.806]  Meanwhile, again here in Austin, I am seeing the economy contract fast.
[00:19:29.826 --> 00:19:31.687]  I mean, it's like an overnight effect.
[00:19:32.047 --> 00:19:35.448]  I mean, restaurants that six months ago I could never get into.
[00:19:35.728 --> 00:19:40.089]  You know, because I'd be at work and say, I want to go eat at this restaurant and it would always be too full to get into.
[00:19:40.689 --> 00:19:43.870]  Now, I went to one of these restaurants a few nights ago and it was about half full.
[00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:46.051]  I mean, we're seeing an immediate effect.
[00:19:46.391 --> 00:19:54.877]  Yeah, when you're saying a credit expansion has a multiplier effect because it puts money into other people's hands, they in turn spend the money and put in investments.
[00:19:55.138 --> 00:20:01.222]  Well, the opposite is true when you have a contraction of credit, and that's what we're experiencing right now.
[00:20:01.522 --> 00:20:06.826]  And the contraction does create more of a dynamic of contracting, just like it would on the upside.
[00:20:09.349 --> 00:20:19.934]  We've seen this whole police state being prepared, gearing up, the government saying they're doing it for financial panic years ago, while they carry out the financial operations they know will bring it to fruition.
[00:20:22.595 --> 00:20:28.278]  What does your gut tell you when this is really going to start breaking loose and get so bad that it can't be ignored?
[00:20:29.454 --> 00:20:34.237]  Well, I think you probably have a better handle on that than I do.
[00:20:34.537 --> 00:20:38.580]  There have been reports of bringing, what, some units home from overseas that would do street.
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:47.685]  You and Mike Hanson did some wonderful videoing down in Kingsville, and I think you tried to do some in San Antonio, but did they not resist that?
[00:20:47.725 --> 00:20:50.187]  No, they kind of put guns to our heads and took the video.
[00:20:50.787 --> 00:20:51.228]  They did.
[00:20:51.348 --> 00:20:54.710]  So, y'all had forewarning of some of this.
[00:20:55.431 --> 00:21:09.301]  So, all I can say is that keep your ear to the ground and listen to some of these units that the National Guard and some of the reserve units and active army units should give us some advance notice, but I don't think it's going to be much.
[00:21:09.341 --> 00:21:12.623]  Well, they've been saying, now it's admitted what we said a decade ago.
[00:21:12.643 --> 00:21:16.766]  They're saying, no, we are here for you, we are here to engage the American people.
[00:21:16.826 --> 00:21:21.432]  Well, they have been training in regular Army units and National Guard units.
[00:21:21.452 --> 00:21:26.599]  They've been training for riot control and crowd control and civilian unrest and riot.
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:29.242]  And those guys I saw in St.
[00:21:29.282 --> 00:21:29.883]  Paul were terrible.
[00:21:30.704 --> 00:21:32.026]  Those Darth Vader uniforms.
[00:21:32.046 --> 00:21:32.406]  Oh, that's right!
[00:21:32.426 --> 00:21:33.688]  And they were mean-spirited, too.
[00:21:34.068 --> 00:21:37.811]  You and Richard almost got arrested a few times when they would just arrest whole peaceful crowds.
[00:21:38.091 --> 00:21:42.314]  Let's briefly talk about that when we get back and anything else you want to cover, George, and then take phone calls.
[00:21:42.554 --> 00:21:43.775]  Ben, Robert, Rick and others.
[00:21:43.955 --> 00:21:44.516]  Okay, fine.
[00:21:44.556 --> 00:21:46.777]  I think we made that video available to you just recently.
[00:21:47.198 --> 00:21:47.858]  Fantastic.
[00:21:47.918 --> 00:21:49.019]  All right.
[00:21:49.459 --> 00:21:50.160]  We'll be right back.
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.441]  Stay with us after this quick break.
[00:21:51.481 --> 00:21:53.002]  In fact, I'm going to skip this break.
[00:21:53.022 --> 00:21:54.443]  I'm going to skip it for InfoWars listeners.
[00:21:55.683 --> 00:22:01.868]  Yeah, let's continue behind the scenes with just the web folks watching and for folks listening at InfoWars.com on those streams.
[00:22:02.548 --> 00:22:04.049]  What's some of the other stuff you want to talk about?
[00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:22.803]  Well, you know, you bring up a very interesting subject and not only are we caught up in the dynamics of everyday living and surviving and trying to discern and you could say navigate our way through these changing events which are tumultuous and very wicked and very dangerous.
[00:22:23.203 --> 00:22:26.105]  But the delusional aspect of this is always there.
[00:22:27.165 --> 00:22:32.288]  And you've been touching on that recently, and I think your insight in that area, I think, is very good.
[00:22:32.428 --> 00:22:37.391]  Well, I'm going to get your insight, because I know you've studied psychology, but people are in willful denial.
[00:22:37.451 --> 00:22:41.714]  Businessmen I know, wealthy people I know, upper middle class, and then just average folks.
[00:22:42.234 --> 00:22:45.056]  I'll say, hey, what do you think about what's happening?
[00:22:45.076 --> 00:22:46.417]  And they're like, I don't want to hear about it.
[00:22:47.017 --> 00:22:50.418]  You know, I know about your show, and I don't want to hear negativity.
[00:22:50.839 --> 00:22:51.699]  It's not negative.
[00:22:51.859 --> 00:22:53.600]  I mean, if your leg's broken, you've got to fix it.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:23:02.083]  And so there's this, the establishment is being encouraged to carry this out because they know the public has been put in a catatonic state.
[00:23:02.643 --> 00:23:06.384]  Yes, that state is one of comfort.
[00:23:07.324 --> 00:23:10.805]  Psychologists, and even pop psychologists, have described it as a comfort zone.
[00:23:11.185 --> 00:23:12.505]  They don't want to disturb that.
[00:23:12.745 --> 00:23:15.486]  You bring some things to them that it's upsetting to them.
[00:23:15.726 --> 00:23:16.786]  It makes them unhappy.
[00:23:17.046 --> 00:23:21.407]  But they need to wake up and start confronting exactly what you're saying.
[00:23:22.188 --> 00:23:27.549]  And you have, in your style, I'll say that, you've hit them right between the eyes.
[00:23:27.589 --> 00:23:28.309]  You wake them up!
[00:23:30.338 --> 00:23:32.499]  Because sometimes that is the best method.
[00:23:32.999 --> 00:23:39.863]  Well, there's different ways for different people, different drugs for different folks, many different ways of thinking, make the world go round.
[00:23:41.244 --> 00:23:50.752]  I just hit people from the honest perspective that I'm freaked out by this, and I know history, and I know what's happening currently is nightmarish, and so that's why I get so upset.
[00:23:50.772 --> 00:23:55.736]  But, you know, the folks that are smooth about it, like yourself, or low-key like Ron Paul, that's also very effective.
[00:23:56.237 --> 00:24:01.581]  And I also want to talk about the fact that we've laid this out and made these predictions, so now people are actually listening.
[00:24:01.761 --> 00:24:08.906]  Yeah, your credibility has soared because you've been saying this for years, and then people said, oh, that's just a bunch of bull, and now they're saying, uh-oh.
[00:24:09.426 --> 00:24:14.189]  And they're coming back to you, and listening to you, and supporting you now, unlike they ever have before.
[00:24:14.209 --> 00:24:17.532]  But I mean, not just myself, I mean... Well, everyone in this area.
[00:24:18.052 --> 00:24:23.656]  But really, the alternative media, you've been at the forefront of many, and 9-11 for sure, you're the founding...
[00:24:24.116 --> 00:24:34.904]  Well, we're going to come back to the full audience and let's go through your take on the comfort zone, the cognitive dissonance, people staying in that little bubble and they don't want you to come into it.
[00:24:35.805 --> 00:24:42.270]  Let's get into what it will look like if we do have a true breakdown and there's already gas shortages, already banking problems, we're already seeing it.
[00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:44.872]  What would a depression like 29 look like?
[00:24:45.432 --> 00:24:47.073]  And then we'll take some phone calls.
[00:24:48.414 --> 00:24:54.558]  Well, first, as we said before we went to break, first let's get into what you saw in Minneapolis-St.
[00:24:54.598 --> 00:25:01.182]  Paul for the RNC as an eyewitness, briefly, and then we'll get into the psychology and then take phone calls.
[00:25:01.702 --> 00:25:02.963]  Here we go, back to the main audience.
[00:25:13.075 --> 00:25:24.419]  Peter Schiff, one of Ron Paul's main economic advisors, and Ron Paul's got international awards for economics papers himself, from Von Mises and others institute.
[00:25:25.059 --> 00:25:27.860]  So this is a quite a expert and I'm
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:31.282]  I've read a lot of his papers and seen him on international and national television.
[00:25:31.302 --> 00:25:36.465]  So, Peter Schiff, his maiden voyage with us coming up in about 27 minutes.
[00:25:36.485 --> 00:25:39.126]  I do want to get to your phone calls at 800-259-9231.
[00:25:39.146 --> 00:25:46.310]  But I tried to get Richard Reeves in here, who's done camera work for us and who's driven us in D.C.
[00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:47.791]  and Dallas and at some other events.
[00:25:48.854 --> 00:25:51.177]  But he just wants you to step butler on.
[00:25:51.837 --> 00:25:55.181]  And so I was meaning to get you on about that, but then all this financial stuff happened.
[00:25:55.622 --> 00:26:00.087]  But just in a nutshell, Reeves told me you guys almost got arrested repeatedly.
[00:26:00.407 --> 00:26:02.569]  The police were clearly targeting peaceful crowds.
[00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:06.273]  In a nutshell, what did you witness at the RNC in Minneapolis, St.
[00:26:06.293 --> 00:26:06.394]  Paul?
[00:26:08.582 --> 00:26:11.883]  I began to witness it not as close in.
[00:26:12.203 --> 00:26:16.224]  Richard went right in there with my camera and got some footage that was unbelievable.
[00:26:16.624 --> 00:26:28.446]  But I saw it a little bit further back, but there was the Darth Vader riot control, and they encircled before the speeches were over, and right in front of the state capitol of St.
[00:26:28.486 --> 00:26:32.227]  Paul, the state capitol of Minnesota, they encircled the whole crowd.
[00:26:32.267 --> 00:26:34.467]  And I said, oh my gosh, what are we in for?
[00:26:34.747 --> 00:26:37.348]  And it was hell getting out of that circle once they encircled us.
[00:26:37.908 --> 00:26:41.130]  But Richard went right in and waited in there and got right close in.
[00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:48.374]  And at the very end, we went back to find the last remnants of those demonstrators.
[00:26:48.654 --> 00:26:57.138]  We found them parked on the Marion Bridge, surrounded, handcuffed, and they'd been pepper sprayed, surrounded by EMS vehicles.
[00:26:57.578 --> 00:27:00.260]  And the police were celebrating this great victory.
[00:27:02.034 --> 00:27:06.844]  Eating little Twinkies or whatever and drinking Coca-Cola.
[00:27:07.425 --> 00:27:08.146]  You know what I mean?
[00:27:08.447 --> 00:27:11.473]  They got a kick out of subduing these peaceful demonstrators.
[00:27:12.085 --> 00:27:25.255]  And then lying to the media and saying they were violent, showing a few videos of anarchists who they never arrested, who had some witnesses, and this was reported by mainstream media, said anarchists would come from behind the police line, bash a police car window out, and run back into the cops.
[00:27:25.555 --> 00:27:29.878]  Now they've been caught provocateuring, and police have been caught dressed up like anarchists before.
[00:27:30.899 --> 00:27:31.740]  Did you see any of that?
[00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:33.702]  That Richard went in on Monday.
[00:27:33.742 --> 00:27:37.945]  We didn't get in there until late Monday evening and I was only part of the demonstration on Thursday.
[00:27:38.245 --> 00:27:42.429]  But Richard was in there and he escaped through a parking garage.
[00:27:42.689 --> 00:27:48.294]  He has quite a story where he ducked out of the crowd and they were encircling them and getting ready to arrest a whole bunch of them.
[00:27:50.523 --> 00:27:54.346]  And he went through a building, and it led to a parking garage, and they weren't covered.
[00:27:54.766 --> 00:27:56.427]  The police had that not covered.
[00:27:56.647 --> 00:27:59.289]  And he got through that parking garage out to the outside of the circle.
[00:28:00.149 --> 00:28:02.571]  But on Thursday, I ordered him out of there.
[00:28:03.171 --> 00:28:03.652]  Okay?
[00:28:03.992 --> 00:28:07.374]  And I told him, I said, Richard, I see him coming in.
[00:28:07.434 --> 00:28:10.956]  I was outside the circle at that time, and I was safe, so to speak.
[00:28:11.196 --> 00:28:13.598]  And I said, Richard, I order you out of here, period.
[00:28:13.638 --> 00:28:15.519]  You get out of there now, you know what I mean?
[00:28:15.839 --> 00:28:16.660]  And he said, yes sir.
[00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:20.463]  I'm a little older than he is, so seniority worked on that.
[00:28:20.703 --> 00:28:23.126]  And he got out, and you know how he got out, Alex?
[00:28:24.046 --> 00:28:30.132]  He walked out with some office workers that had still been behind the lines, inside the encirclement.
[00:28:30.332 --> 00:28:32.254]  Because for those who don't know, they just arrest everybody.
[00:28:32.274 --> 00:28:36.998]  Yes, and he walked out with them like he was part of the office worker group, and they let him down.
[00:28:37.338 --> 00:28:43.485]  And that sends the message, don't be part of protests, don't come out to events, don't engage in your First Amendment, your right to assemble.
[00:28:43.886 --> 00:28:48.091]  And the Feds have to, they hire these anarchists, in some cases the anarchists do it on their own.
[00:28:48.111 --> 00:28:51.014]  I'm not saying all anarchist groups, but clearly the ones that are doing this.
[00:28:52.776 --> 00:28:54.678]  Any other points from the RNC?
[00:28:55.479 --> 00:29:08.011]  Well, the mesmerizing inside, we saw Palin speak on Wednesday and Thursday evening, I was sitting there, and there was one person in that whole auditorium that did not stand and did not clap for McCain, and that was me.
[00:29:08.431 --> 00:29:15.858]  I would not, because of what I know about the gentleman and especially the POW problem, of not going back and getting our POWs back.
[00:29:16.078 --> 00:29:17.879]  Well, was this all mass mind control?
[00:29:18.019 --> 00:29:19.200]  Yes, exactly.
[00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:24.562]  It was this cult of personality that was operating on such a scale that it was overwhelming to me.
[00:29:24.582 --> 00:29:25.943]  Well, it's the same thing.
[00:29:26.003 --> 00:29:28.965]  It's depressing in a way to see that many people go for this.
[00:29:29.065 --> 00:29:29.805]  Losing their minds.
[00:29:29.865 --> 00:29:30.445]  Yes, yes.
[00:29:30.685 --> 00:29:33.567]  Just go, you know, crazy because they want to jump on the power wagon.
[00:29:33.587 --> 00:29:35.468]  Oh, listen, I'm hearing neocons calling to shows.
[00:29:35.728 --> 00:29:35.828]  Yeah.
[00:29:35.988 --> 00:29:37.368]  And they go, she's still a genius.
[00:29:37.709 --> 00:29:39.309]  It's a trick when she acts stupid.
[00:29:39.669 --> 00:29:41.029]  She's going to show them tonight.
[00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:43.130]  And no, we're not saying we're for Obama, folks.
[00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:46.191]  We're saying it's cult of personality with Palin and Obama.
[00:29:46.211 --> 00:29:46.711]  Yes, both sides.
[00:29:46.731 --> 00:29:47.951]  These men run nothing.
[00:29:48.272 --> 00:29:48.852]  Both sides.
[00:29:49.192 --> 00:29:51.132]  They did it in Denver and they did it in St.
[00:29:51.172 --> 00:29:51.472]  Paul.
[00:29:51.672 --> 00:29:55.614]  And it's cult of personality and they've got everybody mindwashed and going for the big deal.
[00:29:55.634 --> 00:29:57.634]  Alright, speaking of psychology, you've studied this.
[00:29:57.674 --> 00:29:57.894]  Yes.
[00:29:58.174 --> 00:30:00.095]  A lot of the public's breaking out of their bunks.
[00:30:00.635 --> 00:30:03.316]  And then they engage in financial terrorism, and some went back into it.
[00:30:04.017 --> 00:30:11.981]  But Congress is afraid of being blamed for a depression, so they're going to probably go along with this, and then all the other fleecing that's going to go on that will devalue the currency in your pension funds.
[00:30:12.761 --> 00:30:15.862]  But I mean, just briefly, the psychology of people that live in denial.
[00:30:16.083 --> 00:30:23.466]  I know they buy into a worldview, and then they will defend that worldview, no matter what all the evidence shows, to their own detriment.
[00:30:23.486 --> 00:30:24.787]  Can you speak to that psychology?
[00:30:24.927 --> 00:30:25.667]  Yes, I can.
[00:30:26.067 --> 00:30:28.569]  What they're actually supporting is the false self.
[00:30:29.449 --> 00:30:35.874]  And we've moved away from that at birth and we've been fed by our families and other people that are suffering in the same mode.
[00:30:36.175 --> 00:30:37.496]  And it's a mode of delusion.
[00:30:37.516 --> 00:30:39.417]  It's play acting is what I call it.
[00:30:39.537 --> 00:30:40.518]  Exactly, exactly.
[00:30:40.838 --> 00:30:45.302]  And that personality, that identity of who we think we are is a false self.
[00:30:45.602 --> 00:30:48.765]  And it's fed by what's wrong in the world, not what's right.
[00:30:49.245 --> 00:30:55.371]  And I maintain that forgiveness can bring you out of that and establish a greater objectivity.
[00:30:55.812 --> 00:31:02.678]  And non-judgment and forgiveness of self and others can create a dynamic that is awakening.
[00:31:02.819 --> 00:31:04.020]  It's an awakening dynamic.
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:04.620]  That's right.
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:09.065]  A lot of people, and it's very complex, but just simply put a little
[00:31:10.424 --> 00:31:12.705]  Yeah, it's sick, but it's also frustrating at times, is it not?
[00:31:36.681 --> 00:31:44.972]  You have a heart that wants to help people in such a powerful way that when they don't respond immediately sometimes, it can be frustrating.
[00:31:45.012 --> 00:31:47.115]  We're all frustrated, but patience is love.
[00:31:47.896 --> 00:31:48.817]  And that's the hardest thing.
[00:31:49.238 --> 00:31:50.860]  It only takes a little time to learn it.
[00:31:51.861 --> 00:31:55.463]  Because, you know, it's a thing that takes time for sure, mainly.
[00:31:55.683 --> 00:31:57.164]  And that's patience with one another.
[00:31:57.184 --> 00:31:59.825]  Because humans are not like light bulbs you can turn off and on.
[00:32:00.226 --> 00:32:01.746]  It takes time to work with them.
[00:32:02.006 --> 00:32:06.009]  And people that have been turned off of you five years ago are your friends today.
[00:32:07.089 --> 00:32:08.951]  Well, that's why I don't get mad at people.
[00:32:09.012 --> 00:32:11.454]  I just feel sorry for them when I try to warn them or show them something.
[00:32:11.955 --> 00:32:13.396]  And if they disagree, that's fine.
[00:32:13.416 --> 00:32:22.206]  But if they get that weird, self-assured, you-know-what-eating grin on their face above, like, pleasure, or, you know, so what, or you tell some yuppies...
[00:32:22.967 --> 00:32:26.491]  Hey, they're going to take our existing roads we paid for and give them to a foreign corporation.
[00:32:26.871 --> 00:32:28.293]  They'll just laugh and say, so what?
[00:32:28.353 --> 00:32:31.036]  Like saying, so what, gives them power over it.
[00:32:31.396 --> 00:32:34.720]  Yeah, there's an arrogance there, but it's not the real self that's speaking.
[00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:37.342]  It's this false glorified self that's interacting with you.
[00:32:37.963 --> 00:32:39.625]  And that's really the cause of warfare.
[00:32:40.346 --> 00:32:43.229]  We have these abstracted selves fighting with abstracted selves.
[00:32:44.472 --> 00:32:46.093]  They're not real identities.
[00:32:46.193 --> 00:32:48.174]  It's a conjured-up construction.
[00:32:48.294 --> 00:32:51.016]  It's an imagined identity of who people think they are.
[00:32:51.036 --> 00:32:51.216]  No, I know.
[00:32:51.236 --> 00:32:52.577]  You always talk about that.
[00:32:52.737 --> 00:32:55.318]  And it's very strange when you lose more and more of that.
[00:32:56.139 --> 00:32:59.181]  And then people take my aggression and my fury as an ego-driven thing.
[00:32:59.281 --> 00:32:59.961]  It's the opposite.
[00:33:00.001 --> 00:33:00.541]  I know it is.
[00:33:00.581 --> 00:33:03.623]  It's an instinct-driven thing out of basic survival.
[00:33:04.063 --> 00:33:06.385]  But so many people
[00:33:07.085 --> 00:33:14.167]  I mean, I remember being three years old, I talk about this a lot, and I was out on the back porch by myself playing, and I was a superhero jumping on and off the back porch.
[00:33:14.187 --> 00:33:24.851]  I remember it was Batman or Superman, and it was a sunny day, and I had this huge, like a thunderbolt hit me, and it said, you're play acting, you're not really the superhero, and you're not the whole world.
[00:33:25.311 --> 00:33:28.272]  You are just a tiny spark of life for a short period of time.
[00:33:28.332 --> 00:33:29.233]  It wasn't a child's thought.
[00:33:29.253 --> 00:33:30.313]  It was like this whole download.
[00:33:30.333 --> 00:33:41.437]  And I realized that I was just this little flotsam and jetsam on the sea of humanity and time and thousands of years and everybody that had come and gone and those that were going to come in the future.
[00:33:41.457 --> 00:33:43.578]  And it wasn't crushing.
[00:33:43.638 --> 00:33:44.538]  It was liberating.
[00:33:44.958 --> 00:33:49.140]  And then my whole life I realized that other people are still playing dress-up.
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.583]  They're still imagining.
[00:33:51.643 --> 00:33:59.093]  That's what trinkets and baubles and cygnets and cymbals are all about, is, like you said, this false template.
[00:33:59.554 --> 00:34:00.395]  Unconscious people.
[00:34:00.635 --> 00:34:04.701]  Yes, you have a connection to reality that not many people have.
[00:34:05.842 --> 00:34:13.974]  No, you see it, but because you have this connection and your studies over the years of the world system, then you can see how evil that it really is.
[00:34:14.174 --> 00:34:16.097]  Well, the elites are self-actualized, though.
[00:34:16.117 --> 00:34:21.185]  I mean, the elites also are conscious and understand in a mechanical way, but it's very cold with them.
[00:34:21.533 --> 00:34:31.823]  But when you see it at the depth, and you see the beast to the center, I mean to the depth that not many people see it, and I see it in the same way, okay?
[00:34:33.184 --> 00:34:40.511]  And it's upsetting to us to see it like that, and then trying to reach out to people, and they're not responding like we want them to do sometimes.
[00:34:41.032 --> 00:34:41.933]  It can be frustrating.
[00:34:43.524 --> 00:34:44.144]  Absolutely.
[00:34:45.205 --> 00:34:48.567]  I wanted to get into a few other issues, but let's go ahead and take some calls.
[00:34:48.587 --> 00:34:50.648]  Well, before we go to calls, any other issues you wanted to bring up?
[00:34:50.908 --> 00:34:53.310]  I know you've got hundreds of things here on the computer to talk about.
[00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:58.713]  Oh, yeah, I just brought up that we've still got the bailout, and they're talking about a rescue bill now.
[00:34:59.585 --> 00:35:01.627]  Are you going to be watching the Palin-Biden?
[00:35:01.667 --> 00:35:02.627]  Yes, I will.
[00:35:03.328 --> 00:35:14.016]  Palin comes from a very religious background, and so that's where, and maybe a dominionism, perhaps, of taking a religious thought and trying to enact that into law.
[00:35:14.836 --> 00:35:16.037]  That's basically that idea.
[00:35:16.077 --> 00:35:20.080]  Well, she certainly uses that as a front to get support.
[00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:24.884]  I think with her, it's just like a beauty pageant, it's all completely fake, but that she's bought into it.
[00:35:24.964 --> 00:35:27.886]  Well, you know the coverage that you gave on Georgia?
[00:35:28.666 --> 00:35:31.728]  The response that she gave about the Russians was totally off the wall.
[00:35:31.748 --> 00:35:33.829]  Well, she said we need to go ahead and have war with them.
[00:35:34.289 --> 00:35:36.150]  She said we need to have war with Russia.
[00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:44.274]  That is totally, totally, gosh, I can't describe how worthy a comment that was.
[00:35:44.354 --> 00:35:49.257]  I meant to do this, and I'm going to do it not to make fun of her, but to illustrate that literally
[00:35:50.617 --> 00:36:06.884]  First, let's play Miss South Carolina, where she just throws out a bunch of mismatched stuff, terms she heard, has nothing to do with the question, and you watch Sarah Palin, and as long as she's giving you some fake conservative line, it sounds eloquent, but she's reading off a teleprompter, folks.
[00:36:07.344 --> 00:36:11.346]  Okay, then they make a big deal about, oh, the teleprompter broke and all this crap she had written prepared.
[00:36:11.366 --> 00:36:14.607]  I mean, this is all about, oh, look, she can talk on her own!
[00:36:14.947 --> 00:36:18.308]  My God, this is so amazing that all these people are reading prepared speeches.
[00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:19.069]  Now,
[00:36:20.222 --> 00:36:23.544]  When she does get an interview and people say, well, what about the Bush Doctrine?
[00:36:23.584 --> 00:36:26.786]  They say, oh, well, that's a liberal media trick to make her look dumb.
[00:36:26.826 --> 00:36:28.607]  That's too complex for her to know.
[00:36:28.627 --> 00:36:37.292]  Well, no, the Bush Doctrine is preemptive war, global government, torture, evil, but she just totally... John, you have that clip of her on Katy Curry.
[00:36:37.312 --> 00:36:38.072]  Let's play that second.
[00:36:38.312 --> 00:36:40.033]  Let's play Miss South Carolina first.
[00:36:40.053 --> 00:36:40.394]  Here it is.
[00:36:41.194 --> 00:36:44.956]  Recent polls have shown a fifth of Americans can't locate the U.S.
[00:36:45.056 --> 00:36:45.797]  on a world map.
[00:36:46.497 --> 00:36:47.438]  Why do you think this is?
[00:36:49.938 --> 00:36:52.680]  I personally believe that U.S.
[00:36:52.740 --> 00:37:15.057]  Americans are unable to do so because some people out there in our nation don't have that and I believe that our education, like such as in South Africa and Iraq, everywhere like such as, and I believe that they should, our education over here in the U.S.
[00:37:15.137 --> 00:37:16.377]  should help the U.S.
[00:37:16.558 --> 00:37:18.259]  or should help South Africa.
[00:37:18.829 --> 00:37:21.253]  It should help Iraq and the Asian countries.
[00:37:21.654 --> 00:37:23.837]  So we will be able to build up our future.
[00:37:23.857 --> 00:37:27.002]  Thank you very much, South Carolina.
[00:37:28.283 --> 00:37:31.044]  And by the way, she's a genius compared to a lot of people.
[00:37:31.084 --> 00:37:34.446]  You talk to men and women now, they don't even know what states are.
[00:37:34.526 --> 00:37:36.807]  They don't even know what different forms of government are.
[00:37:37.047 --> 00:37:39.908]  And it doesn't give me any pleasure like I'm some smart guy.
[00:37:40.128 --> 00:37:43.710]  See, the globalists and their minions, they enjoy the ignorance of the public.
[00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:45.511]  They revel in how people are dumb.
[00:37:45.791 --> 00:37:46.992]  They enjoy conning.
[00:37:47.192 --> 00:37:49.753]  They think they're part of the system, though they're being crushed too, most of them.
[00:37:51.293 --> 00:37:58.556]  But then those of us that do care, and understand that what comes around goes around, and that we can't be a free society with all this idiocy, we're just horrified at this.
[00:37:58.576 --> 00:38:11.440]  And you try to talk to somebody like Miss South Carolina, and they're everywhere, they will just arrogantly snicker at you and, you know, shake some bobbles at you, some bling, and say, look, I have bling, I have booty.
[00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:13.081]  Now, let's go ahead and play.
[00:38:13.121 --> 00:38:16.042]  Now listen how similar she is, Sarah Palin, with
[00:38:19.184 --> 00:38:20.665]  With Miss South Carolina, here it is.
[00:38:21.426 --> 00:38:26.510]  You've cited Alaska's proximity to Russia as part of your foreign policy experience.
[00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:27.711]  What did you mean by that?
[00:38:28.212 --> 00:38:38.941]  That Alaska has a very narrow maritime border between a foreign country, Russia, and on our other side, the land boundary that we have with Canada.
[00:38:39.921 --> 00:38:46.547]  It's funny that a comment like that was kind of made to, I don't know, you know,
[00:38:47.373 --> 00:38:47.813]  Mocked?
[00:38:48.073 --> 00:38:48.674]  Yeah, mocked.
[00:38:48.714 --> 00:38:50.435]  I guess that's the word, yeah.
[00:38:51.875 --> 00:38:56.298]  Well, explain to me why that enhances your foreign policy credentials.
[00:38:56.698 --> 00:39:01.601]  Well, it certainly does because our next-door neighbors are foreign countries.
[00:39:01.681 --> 00:39:05.383]  They're in the state that I am the executive of.
[00:39:06.203 --> 00:39:10.465]  Have you ever been involved with any negotiations, for example, with the Russians?
[00:39:10.866 --> 00:39:12.867]  We have trade missions back and forth.
[00:39:13.857 --> 00:39:24.702]  It's very important when you consider even national security issues with Russia as Putin rears his head and comes into the airspace of the United States of America.
[00:39:25.403 --> 00:39:25.943]  Where do they go?
[00:39:26.483 --> 00:39:27.144]  It's Alaska.
[00:39:27.204 --> 00:39:28.324]  It's just right over the border.
[00:39:28.724 --> 00:39:35.648]  It is from Alaska that we send those out to make sure that an eye is being kept on
[00:39:36.167 --> 00:39:36.407]  This is
[00:39:55.546 --> 00:39:58.188]  A week ago when I sent it to you, I knew the clips, but I sent you too many.
[00:39:58.228 --> 00:39:58.908]  That's not the one.
[00:39:58.928 --> 00:40:03.432]  There's another one with her where she sounds just like Miss South Carolina.
[00:40:03.952 --> 00:40:05.293]  I'll find it on YouTube and play it.
[00:40:05.593 --> 00:40:11.638]  And I mean, she's just like, eh, ooh, and then we do it in the train, and that's how we're friends and helping.
[00:40:12.919 --> 00:40:14.900]  John, you've got some more Sarah Palin clips, right?
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:15.921]  You're pretty good at that.
[00:40:15.941 --> 00:40:16.601]  I'll pick some up.
[00:40:17.882 --> 00:40:22.008]  Yeah, well, I mean, that was actually, you know, not good, but, you know, made up.
[00:40:22.068 --> 00:40:28.958]  I mean, but that's... We got the airspace, we got the motor there, we're gonna go across there, we're gonna invade Russia!
[00:40:30.416 --> 00:40:32.738]  Well, we can find a clip where she said we need to attack Russia.
[00:40:32.778 --> 00:40:33.018]  Yes.
[00:40:33.279 --> 00:40:34.500]  Now, that's dangerous.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:35.861]  No, it doesn't matter.
[00:40:35.901 --> 00:40:38.343]  The point is, we're not saying vote for Barack Obama.
[00:40:38.403 --> 00:40:39.224]  It doesn't matter.
[00:40:39.644 --> 00:40:41.165]  In Travis County, we don't have voting.
[00:40:41.205 --> 00:40:43.387]  It's been proven to be a fraud.
[00:40:44.288 --> 00:40:45.809]  That's how serious these bankers are.
[00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:48.171]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ben in Virginia.
[00:40:48.211 --> 00:40:50.293]  You're on the air with our guest, George Butler.
[00:40:52.335 --> 00:40:52.675]  Hi, Alex.
[00:40:52.695 --> 00:40:53.356]  How are you doing?
[00:40:53.536 --> 00:40:53.756]  Good.
[00:40:53.776 --> 00:40:56.078]  I was one of the protesters in D.C.
[00:40:56.098 --> 00:40:58.500]  that you actually put up on your website on Monday.
[00:40:59.481 --> 00:41:06.527]  I just wanted to say that this whole bailout bill and everything else, it's so clear now and people are so angry.
[00:41:06.587 --> 00:41:16.275]  While I was down in D.C., I actually saw a tourist, a lady was just there touring the Capitol, screaming at House Representatives, asking them, why are you robbing us?
[00:41:16.375 --> 00:41:18.757]  Why are you doing this to us?
[00:41:19.277 --> 00:41:22.860]  And people are so angry right now, we just need to find a way to tap into that.
[00:41:24.383 --> 00:41:36.788]  Well, I agree, and it shows that the people are finally starting to wake up and are not... I mean, again, when Congress has a 9% approval rating even before this, it shows that both parties are now hated.
[00:41:37.108 --> 00:41:49.714]  People realize both parties are in bed together, and they need a woman, a good-looking woman, or they need a handsome, articulate black guy to make it look like it's new and different, because it's not an old white guy.
[00:41:50.074 --> 00:41:50.815]  But that's it.
[00:41:50.915 --> 00:41:56.419]  It's skin color and gender is the only difference with these people.
[00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:00.122]  Yeah, I think the more protesters we get out in D.C.
[00:42:00.262 --> 00:42:02.684]  in the next couple of days, the better.
[00:42:02.744 --> 00:42:05.486]  Because I got on the front page of MSNBC.
[00:42:06.507 --> 00:42:09.370]  I know other people who have been able to infiltrate the news.
[00:42:09.850 --> 00:42:14.314]  And basically, the more active you are, the more it shows that we don't want this bill.
[00:42:14.554 --> 00:42:16.075]  It doesn't matter if they try to cover it up.
[00:42:16.155 --> 00:42:17.236]  You can tell all your friends.
[00:42:17.676 --> 00:42:18.457]  Everybody will know.
[00:42:20.393 --> 00:42:21.313]  That's what it comes down to.
[00:42:23.534 --> 00:42:24.115]  Absolutely.
[00:42:25.835 --> 00:42:26.376]  Anything else?
[00:42:26.396 --> 00:42:27.096]  Thank you very much.
[00:42:27.116 --> 00:42:28.196]  Alright, I appreciate your call.
[00:42:28.837 --> 00:42:35.700]  I am busy here trying to find the particular clip I sent John, where it sounds just like Miss South Carolina.
[00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:41.422]  I mean, she is just... She is just babbling incoherently.
[00:42:41.442 --> 00:42:42.282]  Well, everybody's seen it.
[00:42:42.322 --> 00:42:43.203]  The clips have been everywhere.
[00:42:44.588 --> 00:42:47.589]  We'll come back and take some more phone calls for our guests.
[00:42:47.629 --> 00:43:03.837]  In fact, I want to take the calls, we're going to skip this break too, on the internet at InfoWars.com on those exclusive streams and on PrisonPlanet.tv so we can keep taking your phone calls and get them all in before this hour ends and our next guest joins us, Peter Schiff, Financial Advisor to Ron Paul.
[00:43:05.267 --> 00:43:07.188]  Okay, I'm going to skip this break.
[00:43:07.649 --> 00:43:10.590]  Let's go ahead here and go back to the calls.
[00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:13.532]  Let's talk to Robert in California and then Rick and Paul.
[00:43:13.592 --> 00:43:14.372]  Go ahead, Robert.
[00:43:15.113 --> 00:43:16.493]  Yeah, first a little bit of news.
[00:43:16.673 --> 00:43:33.062]  I was watching Channel 4 out here in California and they quoted Barbara Boxer saying that she received over 95,000 calls and 89,000 were against her voting for a bailout, which is about 94% of the people against this.
[00:43:35.097 --> 00:43:54.961]  Yeah, that's what the scientific polls are showing, 93, 95, Monday, and then most of the polls have been about 91%, there's hundreds of them, you can pull them up, but over 90% are against it, even with the trillion, $200 billion terrorism, when Bush said it'll be a depression and they plunged the market, when Congress said no.
[00:43:56.181 --> 00:44:03.302]  Yeah, and let me ask, does anybody understand what is going on today in the market with the downturn of almost everything?
[00:44:05.304 --> 00:44:12.811]  Is that a reaction to what happened in the foreign markets, or is this just something they just can't control anymore?
[00:44:13.011 --> 00:44:25.721]  Well, look, we are a debtor nation, and in early 2007, the United States went to its highest level of private debt ever.
[00:44:26.462 --> 00:44:28.083]  It's higher than during the Great Depression.
[00:44:28.703 --> 00:44:29.724]  That's an official number.
[00:44:30.164 --> 00:44:31.826]  We have a negative savings.
[00:44:31.906 --> 00:44:33.887]  It's below zero on average.
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:41.742]  And so the bankers then, the Bilderberg Group, said, now pop the subprime, begin the implosion.
[00:44:42.062 --> 00:44:43.943]  So that's why we know it's a controlled implosion.
[00:44:45.243 --> 00:44:48.184]  They claim it's so big it could endanger them, but they initiated it.
[00:44:48.844 --> 00:44:54.686]  And so, as soon as they said, okay, they're now debtors, they pulled the plug on the credit.
[00:44:56.184 --> 00:44:57.845]  And so that is what has happened now.
[00:44:58.385 --> 00:45:07.711]  And you can slice it any way you want, but the architects of our financial doom are the ones now reaping the benefits of it, and Main Street is coming to a halt.
[00:45:08.091 --> 00:45:13.154]  The economy is on the skids, even in Austin, Texas, the supposedly best city in the country to be in.
[00:45:13.874 --> 00:45:19.158]  And I mean, in places like Michigan, and California, and other places, it is bad.
[00:45:19.958 --> 00:45:22.242]  Yeah, and the real estate market.
[00:45:22.282 --> 00:45:24.806]  You know, I've recently purchased some property.
[00:45:34.964 --> 00:45:39.626]  Out in Arizona, some undeveloped land that's bordering state trust.
[00:45:39.686 --> 00:45:44.148]  Am I in, like, danger of them creating a road or anything through there?
[00:45:44.628 --> 00:45:58.273]  Well, I don't know exactly where it's located, but they are stealing a lot of land, hundreds of thousands, well, it's actually over a million acres in Texas and all over the country for international highways that are actually international zones and under international law that are international
[00:45:58.653 --> 00:46:00.074]  That's how the New World Order is going to tax.
[00:46:00.595 --> 00:46:08.220]  One way is carbon taxes, the other is international roads that are internationalized and privatized that then tax the host slave nations.
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:08.881]  Thanks for the call.
[00:46:17.007 --> 00:46:21.170]  I did find a bunch of the clips of Sarah Palin sounding like a babbling idiot.
[00:46:23.846 --> 00:46:26.909]  Yeah, mock, I guess that's the word.
[00:46:29.426 --> 00:46:32.989]  Well, explain to me why that enhances your foreign policy.
[00:46:33.730 --> 00:46:37.052]  Man, I tell ya, that clip is a completely dirty one on the air.
[00:46:37.573 --> 00:46:41.756]  Before we leave, I don't think we're ever leaving the studio, I need to get this line fixed here.
[00:46:42.117 --> 00:46:42.957]  Point is, I'll find it.
[00:46:43.077 --> 00:46:51.104]  John, I sent you about eight clips last Saturday of her, and I think it's the first clip I sent you is the one, but I guess you didn't save that?
[00:46:51.945 --> 00:46:53.426]  So, you're trying to play them here from Texas?
[00:46:53.626 --> 00:46:54.827]  If you sent them, they're saved.
[00:46:54.847 --> 00:46:55.648]  I'll look at it.
[00:46:56.028 --> 00:46:57.309]  Let me just hear some during the break.
[00:46:57.770 --> 00:46:58.570]  Now I'm going to play this.
[00:46:58.610 --> 00:46:59.992]  I should have played it when I first sent them to you.
[00:47:00.492 --> 00:47:02.153]  And I never got around to it because there's so many of them.
[00:47:02.174 --> 00:47:03.094]  I want to find a particular one.
[00:47:03.755 --> 00:47:04.976]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[00:47:05.056 --> 00:47:06.417]  And George, pop in any time here.
[00:47:07.478 --> 00:47:10.441]  Up next here is Rick in Texas.
[00:47:10.461 --> 00:47:11.461]  You're on the air, sir.
[00:47:12.682 --> 00:47:13.343]  Hi.
[00:47:13.523 --> 00:47:16.145]  What's the background of John Cornyn?
[00:47:16.566 --> 00:47:19.008]  I know that they both voted yes, Kay Bailey.
[00:47:19.048 --> 00:47:20.930]  And I know she was a reporter in Houston.
[00:47:22.014 --> 00:47:24.395]  Can you tell me a little bit about John Cornyn, please?
[00:47:24.595 --> 00:47:28.897]  Well, he was a state judge and involved in all sorts of neoconnery.
[00:47:29.637 --> 00:47:34.399]  He was another fake conservative, another stuffed shirt puppet for the New World Order.
[00:47:34.419 --> 00:47:37.421]  I mean, most of these people you see are nothing but fishlers.
[00:47:37.921 --> 00:47:42.784]  I mean, I don't really spend, I don't have conversations with purple worms at the sporting goods store.
[00:47:42.804 --> 00:47:45.706]  I don't have really conversations with Kay Belly Hushes and her cornyn.
[00:47:46.307 --> 00:47:55.773]  I mean, if you've got some outside house members that are good people and aren't controlled, like Ron Paul and a few others, we interview those, but talking to a cornyn, they're nothing but bait for the public.
[00:47:55.853 --> 00:48:00.396]  I mean, they run nothing, do nothing, they're just total puppets.
[00:48:02.458 --> 00:48:04.079]  I mean, they're called cutouts.
[00:48:04.119 --> 00:48:05.600]  You want to comment on Cornyn?
[00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:06.581]  We're right here in Texas.
[00:48:06.601 --> 00:48:07.101]  George Butler?
[00:48:07.741 --> 00:48:13.905]  Well, I believe he does have some kind of a Navy background also, if I'm not mistaken.
[00:48:13.945 --> 00:48:19.369]  I mean, the point is, he's just a nothing puppet who runs nothing, does nothing, and they really hate that when you point out they're just nothings.
[00:48:19.489 --> 00:48:22.851]  But I think he's got a strong tie to Clear Channel, I believe.
[00:48:22.931 --> 00:48:23.852]  Communication also.
[00:48:24.072 --> 00:48:24.452]  Yeah.
[00:48:24.492 --> 00:48:26.653]  Well, what doesn't?
[00:48:26.773 --> 00:48:30.236]  And they took the UT Permanent Fund to buy all that up, and then they handed that over.
[00:48:31.176 --> 00:48:32.156]  Again, they take everything.
[00:48:32.196 --> 00:48:32.896]  It's just everything.
[00:48:33.717 --> 00:48:36.797]  Universities are big into football now because that's all they really do.
[00:48:37.137 --> 00:48:39.178]  There's not much education, not much teaching.
[00:48:39.558 --> 00:48:40.798]  They double, triple tuition.
[00:48:40.818 --> 00:48:41.498]  They're state-run.
[00:48:41.518 --> 00:48:42.879]  They're supposed to be free for citizens.
[00:48:43.879 --> 00:48:45.699]  The oil and gas in Texas take UT.
[00:48:46.319 --> 00:48:48.020]  And it's a cut-out.
[00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:48.980]  It too is a front.
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:54.381]  And 90-something percent of their actions is owning businesses and industries and taking your money out of the country.
[00:48:54.921 --> 00:48:55.401]  Anything else?
[00:48:57.442 --> 00:48:58.702]  Why do you bring up Cornyn, Rick?
[00:49:00.586 --> 00:49:01.947]  Oh, I think they should go to jail.
[00:49:03.687 --> 00:49:04.988]  Yeah, but see, they run the jails.
[00:49:05.008 --> 00:49:06.128]  They own the private prisons.
[00:49:06.208 --> 00:49:07.149]  I appreciate your call.
[00:49:08.269 --> 00:49:10.910]  You know, they got a bunch of brainwashed cops just like the public.
[00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:12.891]  Don't worry, the cops are going to lose everything they got to.
[00:49:13.451 --> 00:49:15.552]  You get to share in what you brought down on us.
[00:49:15.632 --> 00:49:16.092]  Don't worry.
[00:49:16.512 --> 00:49:18.293]  You can laugh and smile all you want.
[00:49:18.313 --> 00:49:19.294]  You'll get what you need.
[00:49:19.354 --> 00:49:19.894]  Don't worry.
[00:49:20.774 --> 00:49:22.295]  Paul in California, go ahead.
[00:49:22.315 --> 00:49:23.855]  Hi, Alex.
[00:49:24.296 --> 00:49:27.457]  I'm one of the organizers of a micropower station.
[00:49:27.952 --> 00:49:28.192]  Good job!
[00:49:28.212 --> 00:49:33.495]  I like the idea of nationalizing the Fed, but unfortunately that puts the government in charge of it, and I suspect that they would be
[00:49:50.495 --> 00:49:54.017]  Just as greedy and corrupt as the people that are running the Fed.
[00:49:54.037 --> 00:50:02.642]  No, we need to take it over and point out it was a criminal organization and put the Fed Directors in prison as Ron Paul, the Congressman, called for on the air here last week.
[00:50:02.662 --> 00:50:04.463]  People should get that article and get it out to everybody.
[00:50:04.983 --> 00:50:08.805]  We need to have that idea first in our minds so we can do that.
[00:50:09.045 --> 00:50:18.991]  But no, we grab it, we monetize the debt, we arrest all these people, we throw them in prison after a jury of their peers finds them guilty, and then we go hunt down the New World Order worldwide and bring them to justice.
[00:50:19.977 --> 00:50:40.537]  And then we, you know, get rid of two million of the three million cops, let them go get real jobs again, and we decriminalize drugs, let the non-violent people out of prisons, we start arresting real criminals, and if your car gets broken into, your house gets robbed, the cops are going to do what they used to do, put their nose to the ground, and go off and do police work, and they can go back to getting pie and coffee and being loved instead of hated.
[00:50:40.557 --> 00:50:41.978]  We'll be right back in one minute.
[00:50:41.998 --> 00:50:42.419]  Stay with us.
[00:50:46.178 --> 00:50:48.158]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:50:50.559 --> 00:50:51.459]  We're not going to cut feed.
[00:50:51.499 --> 00:50:52.699]  We're just going to cut audio.
[00:50:53.479 --> 00:50:55.900]  You know, get rid of 2 million of the 3 million cops.
[00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:57.260]  Let them go get real jobs again.
[00:50:57.780 --> 00:50:59.640]  And we decriminalize drugs.
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:01.181]  Let the non-violent people out of prisons.
[00:51:01.581 --> 00:51:02.861]  We start arresting real criminals.
[00:51:03.441 --> 00:51:09.462]  And if your car gets broken into, your house gets robbed, the cops are going to do what they used to do, put their nose to the ground and go off and do police work.
[00:51:09.502 --> 00:51:12.783]  And they can go back to getting pie and coffee and being loved instead of hated.
[00:51:13.183 --> 00:51:14.203]  Be right back in one minute.
[00:51:14.223 --> 00:51:14.683]  Stay with us.
[00:51:18.351 --> 00:51:20.712]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:51:20.952 --> 00:51:25.553]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:51:27.133 --> 00:51:28.533]  It is a big idea.
[00:51:28.553 --> 00:51:30.654]  A new world order.
[00:51:31.374 --> 00:51:35.575]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:51:36.275 --> 00:51:38.396]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:51:39.096 --> 00:51:41.316]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:51:41.896 --> 00:51:44.277]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:51:45.055 --> 00:51:52.479]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:51:55.401 --> 00:52:00.384]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:52:00.884 --> 00:52:04.246]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:52:11.499 --> 00:52:16.523]  I want to take a few final calls right now with George Butler, our guest, who I want to have back in in the near future.
[00:52:16.543 --> 00:52:19.966]  I think I'm going to have you and Bob Dacey co-host when I'm out of town sometime, if you'll do it.
[00:52:20.246 --> 00:52:21.227]  The two of you together.
[00:52:22.648 --> 00:52:23.889]  I think that'd be a nice dynamic.
[00:52:24.869 --> 00:52:25.650]  Yeah, Bob's a nice guy.
[00:52:25.690 --> 00:52:28.472]  Yeah, he's a smart guy, and so are you, so I think that'd be a nice mix.
[00:52:29.653 --> 00:52:31.054]  Four hours is a lot to do for any one person.
[00:52:31.074 --> 00:52:32.355]  I think the two of you mixed together.
[00:52:32.375 --> 00:52:35.458]  I think it would be great.
[00:52:37.782 --> 00:52:38.843]  Hey Alex, my question is
[00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:11.376]  We know that Rockefeller, it seems like, is there a way to put him, like you've done movies on these guys.
[00:53:11.516 --> 00:53:16.359]  Yeah, David Rockefeller just called for one child policy and population reduction again today.
[00:53:16.399 --> 00:53:18.401]  That's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:53:19.242 --> 00:53:22.004]  How come we can't go and just put, I mean, major, like,
[00:53:22.443 --> 00:53:25.944]  Like, Crimes Against Humanity, on this guy, just put him all over the press.
[00:53:26.304 --> 00:53:34.166]  Because they own most of the counties and cities and the grand juries, and the CIA has run most major cities for 20 years.
[00:53:34.826 --> 00:53:35.467]  I mean, literally.
[00:53:35.507 --> 00:53:38.547]  I mean, they pay people off in satchels of money, kill mayors, police chiefs.
[00:53:39.008 --> 00:53:40.208]  I mean, the U.S.
[00:53:40.268 --> 00:53:43.869]  military runs America, and now NORTHCOM publicly does it.
[00:53:44.389 --> 00:53:48.031]  And you get a Jim Garrison every once in a while, and they went after him and threatened his children.
[00:53:48.512 --> 00:53:52.955]  But as the evil unfolds, more and more people in government who haven't been bought off will stand up.
[00:53:53.795 --> 00:53:55.176]  But they've corrupted so many.
[00:53:55.837 --> 00:53:59.839]  Most sheriffs are now former FBI or CIA, run by the feds and put in power.
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:05.743]  And so, yes, we need grand juries to indict Bernanke, Paulson.
[00:54:06.344 --> 00:54:09.066]  They've committed crimes publicly, as Ron Paul said on air last week.
[00:54:09.366 --> 00:54:11.547]  We need to bring them to justice.
[00:54:15.050 --> 00:54:20.374]  The State Department Memorandum 200, where it openly calls for genocide, that's U.S.
[00:54:20.474 --> 00:54:20.874]  law?
[00:54:20.894 --> 00:54:22.115]  I mean, that's U.S.
[00:54:22.155 --> 00:54:22.696]  policy?
[00:54:22.796 --> 00:54:24.317]  Kissinger should be arrested right now.
[00:54:24.677 --> 00:54:26.639]  In fact, he's indicted all over the world.
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:31.483]  I mean, this is the one, we just need to focus on these two names are the big players.
[00:54:31.503 --> 00:54:32.323]  They all work for him.
[00:54:32.543 --> 00:54:35.466]  Bernanke and all of them work for Rockefeller.
[00:54:35.526 --> 00:54:38.148]  We need to really focus on him and Henry Kissinger.
[00:54:38.621 --> 00:54:45.785]  Just really work on those two guys right there, if we can just focus on two individuals to try to bring them down and let the whole world come against them.
[00:54:45.805 --> 00:54:50.327]  Well, I mean, it would be good to bring them down, but remember, it's like shark teeth.
[00:54:50.887 --> 00:54:53.329]  They've got all their evil underlings under them and it's a system.
[00:54:53.349 --> 00:54:55.770]  You've got to discredit the private Federal Reserve System.
[00:54:55.810 --> 00:54:56.810]  I appreciate your call, Scott.
[00:54:57.291 --> 00:54:59.432]  Anthony in New Jersey, last caller on the air.
[00:54:59.472 --> 00:54:59.812]  Go ahead.
[00:54:59.832 --> 00:55:01.373]  Hi, Alex.
[00:55:01.493 --> 00:55:05.835]  I was just curious if you're familiar with some of the policies and rhetoric of Lyndon LaRouche?
[00:55:06.693 --> 00:55:10.998]  Yes, I agree with his analysis about the Anglo-American banking establishment.
[00:55:11.358 --> 00:55:15.843]  What about some of his ideas about returning to FDR's policies?
[00:55:15.883 --> 00:55:23.672]  Well, we've had Tarpoli, who was formerly one of his acolytes, who kind of espouses the same model, and that is a
[00:55:25.193 --> 00:55:32.757]  Better model than the corporate kleptocracy that is not free capitalism, free market that we have now.
[00:55:33.918 --> 00:55:36.679]  And instead of bailing out the bankers, I agree.
[00:55:36.999 --> 00:55:46.664]  I mean, if they really just gave each American, so there wasn't any bureaucracy, $50,000, basically what would be their piece of this bailout, that would actually get the economy going.
[00:55:46.684 --> 00:55:50.606]  You're still going to devalue the currency, but people could, you know, that would help a little bit.
[00:55:50.886 --> 00:55:53.888]  But if they're going to go ahead and devalue it to begin with, George?
[00:55:54.948 --> 00:55:59.509]  Lyndon LaRouche is quite an interesting character in his world view.
[00:55:59.830 --> 00:56:08.872]  He's mixed Neo-Platonism in with Alexander Hamilton and a very strong collectivist socialist view that I can't subscribe to.
[00:56:09.392 --> 00:56:10.733]  That's basically what he's doing.
[00:56:10.753 --> 00:56:11.573]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:56:11.593 --> 00:56:14.994]  He's right about the problems, but then his solution is not correct.
[00:56:15.014 --> 00:56:21.876]  We'll be talking to somebody who I do agree with, Peter Schiff, coming up in the next segment, okay?
[00:56:22.136 --> 00:56:24.438]  He's still a statist, Lyndon LaRouche is.
[00:56:24.958 --> 00:56:25.859]  He's for big government.
[00:56:26.139 --> 00:56:27.400]  Which the bankers want it.
[00:56:27.601 --> 00:56:28.281]  Yes, that's right.
[00:56:28.621 --> 00:56:31.864]  He knows the money problem, but he's wanting to cure it with the big government.
[00:56:31.904 --> 00:56:38.189]  Yeah, he's saying the problem is we've got corrupt people in charge of the large... Put me in charge and it's going to be okay.
[00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:39.611]  Well, also... That's what he said.
[00:56:39.631 --> 00:56:42.913]  The LaRouche-ian organization itself, I'll just say, is very pushy.
[00:56:45.342 --> 00:56:47.603]  Well, just if you've ever had any experience with them, folks, you know.
[00:56:47.663 --> 00:56:49.143]  I've studied them for about three years.
[00:56:49.684 --> 00:56:55.166]  You know what my grandma used to say, if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.
[00:56:55.186 --> 00:56:56.646]  Okay, good advice.
[00:56:56.706 --> 00:56:57.706]  Hey, George, thanks for coming in.
[00:56:57.726 --> 00:56:58.787]  Okay, thank you.
[00:56:58.827 --> 00:56:59.587]  We have shift, don't we?
[00:57:00.507 --> 00:57:01.188]  You got me on hold.
[00:57:01.268 --> 00:57:01.788]  Fantastic.
[00:57:04.898 --> 00:57:08.283]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:57:08.423 --> 00:57:13.630]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:57:13.830 --> 00:57:18.516]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:57:19.838 --> 00:57:22.699]  KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water.
[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:26.301]  And it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron.
[00:57:26.421 --> 00:57:30.123]  And it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[00:57:30.483 --> 00:57:36.046]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:57:36.266 --> 00:57:42.329]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[00:57:42.529 --> 00:57:43.190]  What about you?
[00:57:43.570 --> 00:57:45.491]  Order your KDF shower filter normally.

[00:58:04.402 --> 00:58:10.746]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:58:11.107 --> 00:58:12.788]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:14.801]  But who is the enemy?
[00:58:15.261 --> 00:58:15.802]  Bin Laden.
[00:58:16.082 --> 00:58:17.043]  This is his MO.
[00:58:17.063 --> 00:58:18.384]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:58:18.404 --> 00:58:20.086]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:58:20.426 --> 00:58:27.193]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:58:27.593 --> 00:58:28.033]  Some U.S.
[00:58:28.073 --> 00:58:33.759]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:58:34.399 --> 00:58:37.900]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:48.144]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:58:48.384 --> 00:58:49.124]  Fabled enemies.

[00:59:27.713 --> 00:59:30.095]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[00:59:30.435 --> 00:59:32.517]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[00:59:32.557 --> 00:59:33.057]  this fall?
[00:59:33.538 --> 00:59:34.038]  Don't wait.
