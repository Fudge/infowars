[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.190]  We're live at PrisonPlanet.tv coming up
[00:00:21.016 --> 00:00:29.840]  In 30 minutes, we're going to be joined in studio by Bob Dacey for the Balance of the Radio show to talk about what's happening with the economy, the global banking system, the private Federal Reserve.
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.401]  Know your enemy, know who is behind this.
[00:00:31.881 --> 00:00:33.482]  Continued open phones today.
[00:00:34.042 --> 00:00:40.766]  Is anyone shocked by Barack Obama having police and prosecutors threaten to arrest people that criticize Barack Obama?
[00:00:42.286 --> 00:00:48.810]  We're talking about the economic hijinks that are going on, a bunch of other news as well right now.
[00:00:49.827 --> 00:00:50.867]  Let's go back to the calls.
[00:00:51.507 --> 00:00:53.728]  Let's talk to AJ in Maine.
[00:00:53.748 --> 00:00:55.729]  AJ, you are on the air.
[00:00:55.749 --> 00:00:56.909]  Hi, Alex.
[00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:57.409]  Hi.
[00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:09.612]  First of all, I know that money is the root of all evil, and I'm wondering if this whole bailout thing is kind of taking everyone's eye off the ball as far as the other issues that are going on right now.
[00:01:09.652 --> 00:01:11.352]  Well, money is not the root of all evil.
[00:01:11.433 --> 00:01:12.713]  The love of money.
[00:01:13.996 --> 00:01:29.826]  Yes, as far as everyone's scared of, you know, losing their retirement, the stock market crashing, you know, everyone's more concerned about... Yeah, they're terrorizing, saying, give the private banks government power, total immunity, and let us steal trillions of dollars more from you, because this is the final phase.
[00:01:29.846 --> 00:01:31.187]  They're saying, why not steal it all?
[00:01:31.607 --> 00:01:32.567]  You know, we're going for it.
[00:01:32.588 --> 00:01:33.608]  We're going for a police state.
[00:01:33.628 --> 00:01:34.469]  We're going for it all.
[00:01:35.309 --> 00:01:35.669]  And so, yes,
[00:01:38.371 --> 00:01:45.253]  The elite, the elite, the elite, to answer your question, are using the people's greed to support this, but it's not working.
[00:01:45.593 --> 00:01:46.994]  The people know it's a scam.
[00:01:47.834 --> 00:01:56.037]  It's a crisis of confidence, both in the markets and with the government, and so you've got 90-something percent against it, but the elite shows its colors and says, you know what?
[00:01:56.357 --> 00:01:56.997]  We don't care!
[00:01:58.358 --> 00:01:58.778]  Exactly.
[00:01:59.178 --> 00:02:07.701]  But as far as, like, the organization, as far as the real matters, like the 9-11 Truth Movement and, you know, this Iran-Russia thing and the presidential election,
[00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:18.820]  Isn't there any way for an organization to come together and get some big lawyers behind them, kind of like what the ACLU does, and really push for that?
[00:02:21.314 --> 00:02:36.647]  There's no magic silver bullet, but certainly grand juries at the state level where these crimes have been committed in Dallas and Houston and LA and New York and DC, they can be calling for indictments, handing down indictments for all these different criminals.
[00:02:37.468 --> 00:02:40.630]  That would slow the system down if we had local justice, but we don't.
[00:02:42.452 --> 00:02:53.977]  I mean, the only other option is the whole fear of that, like you were talking about, the violence and, you know, the militias and all these, like, secret things that are going on right now and these riots and them declaring martial law.
[00:02:54.477 --> 00:02:57.559]  I mean, that's totally out of people like ours control.
[00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:58.799]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:00.720]  And people always say, well, give us a solution, Alex.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.403]  I've probably given 20 or 30 in the last two hours different things we can do, ideas, but they're all real world.
[00:03:08.304 --> 00:03:10.065]  I'm like a carpenter or a farmer.
[00:03:10.825 --> 00:03:12.266]  People say, well, give us food.
[00:03:12.326 --> 00:03:34.747]  Well, I've got to find the fields, I've got to plow them, I've got to plant the right crop, I've got to water it, I've got to till it, I've got to pull weeds, I've got to bring it to harvest, I've got to have a silo to put it in, I've got to prepare it, we've got to grind it, we've got to bake it, we've got to have cows to milk to make the butter, and people want a loaf of bread, but they're used to the loaf of bread falling out of the sky.
[00:03:34.767 --> 00:03:35.868]  It doesn't fall out of the sky.
[00:03:38.427 --> 00:03:41.028]  Why can't we look at the Constitution as the Bible?
[00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:42.769]  The Bible, you know, is Word.
[00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:43.790]  It's not changed.
[00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.391]  People follow it, you know, the Constitution.
[00:03:46.411 --> 00:03:50.734]  But they'd have to know the Constitution in this long process of corruption.
[00:03:50.774 --> 00:03:51.934]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[00:03:53.135 --> 00:04:02.220]  The problem here is that we're trying to fix the Titanic after it's hit the iceberg and busted open four or five of its bulkheads.
[00:04:03.841 --> 00:04:07.263]  The salt water's pouring in, it's flooded the bulkheads, you're not going to save it.
[00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.882]  And the Elite's already gotten the lifeboats and they've already gone off to their own private islands.
[00:04:13.483 --> 00:04:18.887]  And they've got SWAT teams on the deck of the ship making sure we continue to polish the silverware.
[00:04:21.429 --> 00:04:22.510]  And that's what's going to happen.
[00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.332]  SWAT teams, all of us, going under.
[00:04:24.772 --> 00:04:25.673]  While the Elite laughs.
[00:04:26.693 --> 00:04:28.175]  Only by somehow
[00:04:29.545 --> 00:04:35.169]  Admitting that this has happened and making makeshift rafts or something, here's the analogy, can we try to do that?
[00:04:35.209 --> 00:04:39.732]  But the SWAT teams like their devil tats and like the steroids and the shaved heads and acting tough.
[00:04:40.172 --> 00:04:41.493]  So they're going to lose everything too.
[00:04:42.233 --> 00:04:45.896]  So we can at least, after we're on the bottom of the North Atlantic, know what happened.
[00:04:45.936 --> 00:04:48.157]  So when we start over, we know who to blame.
[00:04:48.177 --> 00:04:49.018]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:49.935 --> 00:04:50.355]  Let's go.
[00:05:10.953 --> 00:05:11.533]  I don't know.
[00:05:33.848 --> 00:05:34.528]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:34.548 --> 00:05:35.088]  A new world order.
[00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:37.469]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:05:59.466 --> 00:06:02.248]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:06:02.288 --> 00:06:04.469]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.511]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:06:08.252 --> 00:06:15.577]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:06:18.607 --> 00:06:23.550]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:27.533]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:06:27.913 --> 00:06:30.395]  Bill Burdick is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:06:30.475 --> 00:06:31.636]  Most people have no idea.
[00:06:31.656 --> 00:06:32.416]  They're not after money.
[00:06:32.436 --> 00:06:33.517]  They have all the money they need.
[00:06:33.717 --> 00:06:34.438]  They're after power.
[00:06:34.478 --> 00:06:35.538]  That's what they're after these years.

[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.643]  Why does our government not allow this crop to grow in the U.S.?
[00:07:40.903 --> 00:07:43.265]  This product is also great for pets and animals.

[00:07:50.973 --> 00:07:56.558]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:07.512 --> 00:08:09.714]  Okay, taking your phone calls right now.
[00:08:09.734 --> 00:08:11.575]  Bob Dacey and Studio coming up.
[00:08:14.197 --> 00:08:17.139]  Up next here, Keith in Vermont.
[00:08:17.199 --> 00:08:18.140]  You're on the air.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:18.601]  Welcome.
[00:08:19.361 --> 00:08:19.801]  Hey, Alex.
[00:08:19.821 --> 00:08:20.282]  How you doing?
[00:08:20.382 --> 00:08:20.842]  Good, Keith.
[00:08:20.862 --> 00:08:21.523]  Good to talk to you.
[00:08:22.163 --> 00:08:23.404]  Good to talk to you, too.
[00:08:23.524 --> 00:08:25.866]  You know, I just wanted to bring up a couple quick points.
[00:08:26.166 --> 00:08:32.151]  You know, I've been listening for quite a while, and I think that a couple things that people need to do simply is vote.
[00:08:33.132 --> 00:08:36.034]  Contact your congresspeople, as I have about voting no.
[00:08:36.784 --> 00:08:52.347]  On this bailout, I've contacted, I live in Vermont currently, but I contacted Barack Obama, which is where I'm registered to vote, and I let all my senators and representatives know to vote no on this, and I think that's something that people need to do.
[00:08:53.187 --> 00:08:54.667]  And by the way, they admit that.
[00:08:54.707 --> 00:08:59.608]  They admit that around 5 to 9 percent, depending on the poll, are for it, 90 plus percent against it.
[00:09:00.088 --> 00:09:05.229]  Another testament, this government is rogue, this government is criminal, because they are planning to pass it.
[00:09:05.765 --> 00:09:20.390]  Yeah, and I'm sitting at home today watching, as it doesn't pass in the House, as it has not passed, that, you know, watching the stock market just take a tumble, it's like 500 to 600 points down at points.
[00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:27.252]  I think this goes to show exactly a lot of the things that you've been talking about, and gold is like the only thing that went up.
[00:09:28.272 --> 00:09:28.952]  Gold is like an $18 up.
[00:09:32.096 --> 00:09:39.788]  So, I think people need to take stock in some of the things, not just that you say, but that other people in the same community say, and people need to listen to.
[00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:42.733]  Well, what have we said here that hasn't come true?
[00:09:43.553 --> 00:09:44.954]  I mean, and it's not hard.
[00:09:44.994 --> 00:09:46.575]  The globalists say what they're doing.
[00:09:46.595 --> 00:09:57.060]  I mean, we got it almost three years ago out of Bilderberg that they were going to stage an economic collapse triggered by the subprime mortgages and blame it on the people.
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:00.362]  I mean, we didn't just say there'd be a collapse in a few years.
[00:10:00.402 --> 00:10:04.484]  We said exactly what would happen because we were getting it from the global rulers.
[00:10:05.645 --> 00:10:06.986]  And so, again,
[00:10:08.171 --> 00:10:16.734]  We have all these declassified army documents about how they like to stage terror attacks, so of course we talk about the government staging terror attacks.
[00:10:16.814 --> 00:10:19.655]  We're only going off what they say and what they do.
[00:10:20.535 --> 00:10:21.296]  And it's been proven.
[00:10:23.444 --> 00:10:34.212]  Thank you, and I just, like I said, I've been in my mom's ear constantly, because my mom and dad support Obama, even though they're in their seventies, which would make them fit more the camp of McCain.
[00:10:35.073 --> 00:10:36.594]  Well, see, he's a false revolution.
[00:10:36.834 --> 00:10:45.760]  The global architects, the social architects, the social engineers, they know that the people are mad, so they give us something on the surface that looks different.
[00:10:46.121 --> 00:10:49.443]  A younger, well-spoken black man.
[00:10:49.963 --> 00:10:52.025]  Right, and it seems like it would appease a lot of people.
[00:10:52.472 --> 00:10:58.799]  You know, I gave my parents a copy of the Truth Rising, and they just left my house a couple days ago.
[00:10:58.839 --> 00:11:02.383]  We'll see what kind of feedback I get from them, but it's just, it's doing stuff like that.
[00:11:02.463 --> 00:11:07.469]  I've passed it to neighbors, I've passed it to friends, just trying to say, hey, people need to pay attention.
[00:11:07.749 --> 00:11:12.295]  It's not as simple as, I don't even want to say it, it's not as simple as black and white, but it's not.
[00:11:12.415 --> 00:11:13.336]  It's not as simple as
[00:11:13.886 --> 00:11:15.387]  It's this guy's good and that guy's bad.
[00:11:15.407 --> 00:11:16.387]  There's a lot more to it.
[00:11:16.427 --> 00:11:19.268]  There's a lot of cards and smoke and mirrors that they use.
[00:11:19.488 --> 00:11:20.148]  Absolutely.
[00:11:20.449 --> 00:11:21.089]  Absolutely.
[00:11:21.129 --> 00:11:22.669]  I appreciate your call, Keith.
[00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:24.450]  Mike in Tennessee.
[00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:25.470]  Mike, you're on the air.
[00:11:26.731 --> 00:11:27.171]  Hey, Alex.
[00:11:27.191 --> 00:11:28.191]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:11:28.332 --> 00:11:33.734]  I went to the debate Friday in Ole Miss, and I tell you, the cops were great.
[00:11:34.094 --> 00:11:35.154]  I spoke to several of them.
[00:11:35.574 --> 00:11:37.395]  They were in blue uniforms, laid back.
[00:11:37.555 --> 00:11:39.116]  They actually gave me the thumbs up.
[00:11:39.436 --> 00:11:42.537]  I made a sign that said 9-11 was an inside job, and the other side said,
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:48.084]  Save America for Paulson, and they were great.
[00:11:48.244 --> 00:11:57.291]  But the thing that I noticed, they did a poll after the debate, I think they said locally there at the event 36% were pro-Obama, 22% for McCain.
[00:11:57.732 --> 00:12:00.054]  I think that leaves about 44% undecided.
[00:12:00.474 --> 00:12:09.661]  And I was talking to Chris Matthews, and I said, I think the undecided are the people that are true conservatives that wanted Ron Paul to get in there, or somebody other than McCain.
[00:12:10.734 --> 00:12:16.957]  Democrats up in the Northeast cross party lines to go vote for McCain to get the weakest candidate possible for the Republicans.
[00:12:17.597 --> 00:12:33.544]  And I think that if these 44% of the people get up and go and vote on Election Day, we could possibly have a, you know, a great turnout for either the constitutional party candidate, Chuck Baldwin, or right in for Ron Paul.
[00:12:33.904 --> 00:12:35.404]  And he kind of nodded his head.
[00:12:35.644 --> 00:12:36.665]  And he also signed my
[00:12:37.278 --> 00:12:44.764]  9-11 was an inside job poster, which I found quite interesting.
[00:12:47.607 --> 00:12:52.331]  If you watched Hardball, I'm the guy directly behind him on the left with the sign that keeps flipping.
[00:12:52.771 --> 00:12:54.973]  One side is 9-11's inside job, the other side is
[00:12:55.603 --> 00:12:56.865]  Save America, fire Paulson.
[00:12:56.905 --> 00:12:58.207]  He signed the back of my sign.
[00:12:58.447 --> 00:13:00.330]  Didn't want to sign the front, but he did sign the back.
[00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:03.854]  Well, Save America, arrest Paulson, but I love your sign.
[00:13:04.375 --> 00:13:10.243]  No, I mean, I try to not bash police, though I do do it, because the culture's out of control, the orders they're giving are unconstitutional.
[00:13:11.264 --> 00:13:16.565]  And a lot of police really are awake right now, more than even the general public, because they know what's going on behind the scenes.
[00:13:17.686 --> 00:13:18.766]  But, I mean, it's time.
[00:13:19.346 --> 00:13:26.488]  It's time for everybody to speak up and say no, because the times that are coming, as bad as things are now, this is nothing.
[00:13:26.968 --> 00:13:30.829]  I mean, how many police were giving you a thumbs up to your 9-11 inside job poster?
[00:13:31.607 --> 00:13:38.631]  I walked past one pool of maybe 20 or 30, and three or four of them that watched me as I walked by gave me the thumbs up.
[00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:40.372]  The others weren't really paying attention to me.
[00:13:40.512 --> 00:13:41.853]  I didn't see any secret service.
[00:13:41.913 --> 00:13:45.855]  I didn't see anybody with a black suit talking into their sleeve, nothing like that.
[00:13:45.975 --> 00:13:48.137]  But of course, I was about 200 yards away.
[00:13:48.157 --> 00:13:51.759]  I was in what's called The Grove, about 200 yards away from the theater.
[00:13:52.359 --> 00:13:57.442]  But actually, I met some people just an hour before the event who were not supposed to go in.
[00:13:58.021 --> 00:13:58.361]  I think so.
[00:14:17.633 --> 00:14:21.994]  What do you think of Obama's supporters?
[00:14:22.374 --> 00:14:23.634]  I met his coordinator.
[00:14:23.694 --> 00:14:25.835]  I met his coordinator from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
[00:14:25.875 --> 00:14:30.696]  She was behind everybody, passing out brochures, telling them, you know, everybody was dispersed.
[00:14:30.856 --> 00:14:32.836]  She said, wait a minute, they're going to be back in five minutes.
[00:14:32.876 --> 00:14:33.416]  Wait right here.
[00:14:33.716 --> 00:14:35.876]  And she was coordinating everybody's activities.
[00:14:35.916 --> 00:14:42.458]  So if you looked at hardball and you see people get real excited, you had a guy from hardball trying to jazz everybody up beforehand.
[00:14:42.498 --> 00:14:44.578]  Plus, she was back there saying, okay, everybody get ready.
[00:14:45.362 --> 00:14:50.544]  And so, it was choreographed, I would say, from the Abala standpoint.
[00:14:50.564 --> 00:14:55.107]  None of these were paid people, but they were their supporters, but they were being coached as to what to do.
[00:14:55.147 --> 00:14:55.747]  I understand.
[00:14:55.927 --> 00:15:02.550]  What do you think about Obama's supporters, police and others, in at least three states, threatening to arrest people that badmouth Obama?
[00:15:04.019 --> 00:15:04.739]  I didn't see any of that.
[00:15:04.799 --> 00:15:07.340]  No, I'm saying that's been reported now.
[00:15:07.741 --> 00:15:08.841]  Do you have a comment on that?
[00:15:09.481 --> 00:15:10.542]  Yeah, major tyranny.
[00:15:11.522 --> 00:15:18.345]  Anytime a government agent gets involved with anything having to do with a campaign like that, those people need to be arrested.
[00:15:18.385 --> 00:15:20.066]  Those people need to be put in jail.
[00:15:20.953 --> 00:15:24.215]  They're violating, I believe, federal and state statutes.
[00:15:24.835 --> 00:15:25.256]  No, they are.
[00:15:25.276 --> 00:15:33.200]  There are statutes about officials, government, especially police, getting involved and trying to frustrate people's choice in elections.
[00:15:33.661 --> 00:15:35.321]  And that's a big no-no.
[00:15:35.341 --> 00:15:43.967]  I wonder if these Obama police and prosecutors and sheriff's department people realize that they're opening themselves up for serious felonies.
[00:15:44.427 --> 00:15:45.427]  I appreciate your call.
[00:15:45.608 --> 00:15:46.908]  There are a bunch of laws against that.
[00:15:47.869 --> 00:15:48.689]  Who's up next here?
[00:15:48.729 --> 00:15:49.410]  Cody in Florida?
[00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:51.871]  Or did we just talk to Cody?
[00:15:54.433 --> 00:15:56.374]  Let's go to... Who's up next, Jason?
[00:15:58.096 --> 00:15:58.616]  Brian in New York.
[00:15:58.736 --> 00:15:59.777]  Okay, Brian in New York.
[00:15:59.797 --> 00:16:00.578]  We just talked to Cody.
[00:16:00.938 --> 00:16:01.839]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[00:16:02.919 --> 00:16:03.420]  Hi, Alex.
[00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:03.880]  Hi.
[00:16:05.481 --> 00:16:10.325]  I was just on CNN and it looks like the bailout package was defeated.
[00:16:10.906 --> 00:16:11.606]  That's shocking.
[00:16:11.626 --> 00:16:13.928]  We had a congressman on it at first thinking it was going to pass.
[00:16:15.389 --> 00:16:17.031]  They're stalling it for some reason.
[00:16:17.071 --> 00:16:18.512]  They're not letting it not pass.
[00:16:21.627 --> 00:16:22.828]  Like the floor's still open on it?
[00:16:23.208 --> 00:16:25.169]  Well, that's what it looked like during the last break.
[00:16:25.209 --> 00:16:26.150]  I was watching C-SPAN.
[00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:30.973]  It looked like that it was going against, but that's very interesting.
[00:16:31.953 --> 00:16:40.418]  And I was going to say, I haven't heard anyone say this yet, but debt is extremely maxed out on every aspect.
[00:16:41.719 --> 00:16:48.243]  And there's a lot of talk now of going to gold, but wouldn't the bankers love to get paid back all that debt in gold?
[00:16:49.158 --> 00:16:56.803]  Well, how are they going to physically, if you've got gold buried under the old hickory tree, or silver, how are they going to physically squeeze that out of you?
[00:16:57.103 --> 00:17:05.349]  The point is... I mean, if we made the dollar, like, gold again, or... They put the Amaro in and it was based on gold.
[00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:08.231]  Sure, well that's not seriously being discussed.
[00:17:08.251 --> 00:17:14.355]  They're talking about re-monetizing the debt with a new regional currency that will be fiat as well.
[00:17:15.675 --> 00:17:19.457]  So there's just not enough gold and silver to make the currency be backed by that.
[00:17:19.517 --> 00:17:25.260]  I know some of the economists from the Austrian school have called for that, but that's really not being seriously discussed.
[00:17:25.901 --> 00:17:29.102]  Alright, that's all I really have.
[00:17:29.242 --> 00:17:30.383]  Thank you, appreciate the call.
[00:17:30.803 --> 00:17:36.286]  Here is the headline, House Votes Down Bill to Bail Out Financial Markets.
[00:17:37.787 --> 00:17:39.908]  And so the stock market was already plunging.
[00:17:39.968 --> 00:17:44.391]  It's going to plunge even further as the private Federal Reserve, involved in insider trading,
[00:17:45.151 --> 00:17:48.137]  Through the Plunge Protection Team.
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:53.369]  You watch, they are now not going to basically pump money into the market today.
[00:17:54.514 --> 00:17:58.695]  And then it will plunge even further and they can say, see, we told you so.
[00:17:59.255 --> 00:18:02.916]  House votes against $700 million rescue plan.
[00:18:03.577 --> 00:18:11.199]  Washington House lawmakers voted 205 to 228 Monday against approving the historic $700 million financial rescue plan.
[00:18:11.739 --> 00:18:19.441]  A sharp blow to the administration and a bipartisan rallying efforts for leaders in Congress who warned the country's on the brink of economic collapse unless it's passed.
[00:18:20.438 --> 00:18:29.364]  With elections approaching, some lawmakers, both Democrat and Republican, may feel nervous about voting for a plan that will risk so much taxpayer money and can't promise success.
[00:18:29.704 --> 00:18:32.786]  But the President has lobbied hard to approve the plan, and U.S.
[00:18:32.826 --> 00:18:36.169]  officials also have stressed the dire consequences of action.
[00:18:36.829 --> 00:18:44.154]  And there is a bunch of language we've been scanning over the bill about immunity for those involved in the financial structure for their crimes.
[00:18:45.711 --> 00:18:52.756]  Critics say the plan does not adequately address problems such as job loss and distressed housing market that underline current economic weakness.
[00:18:53.817 --> 00:18:53.937]  U.S.
[00:18:53.977 --> 00:19:00.062]  officials have hoped that the plan would ease the credit crunch and restore confidence in markets, even as the markets plunge around the world.
[00:19:00.862 --> 00:19:01.783]  Worldwide, they're plunging.
[00:19:02.263 --> 00:19:10.069]  Those in favor of the rescue plan may have been trying to treat the most manageable symptom, the frozen credit market, if not the actual disease.
[00:19:10.189 --> 00:19:11.911]  A vote in the Senate was expected
[00:19:12.651 --> 00:19:15.472]  Wednesday, and the President would have followed with speedy signature.
[00:19:16.032 --> 00:19:30.739]  Earlier today, doubt emerged over whether enough representatives would vote in favor of the plan, as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appealed to colleagues in the earlier afternoon, stressing representatives will continue to monitor financial issues and pursue additional strategies.
[00:19:31.059 --> 00:19:34.140]  She said it's imperative that the measure on the floor receives bipartisan support.
[00:19:37.921 --> 00:19:44.071]  So, we'll continue breaking down the latest economic developments as they unfold on the other side of this quick break.

[00:20:49.577 --> 00:20:55.940]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.301]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:20:58.961 --> 00:21:00.001]  But who is the enemy?
[00:21:00.501 --> 00:21:01.062]  Bin Laden.
[00:21:01.302 --> 00:21:02.282]  This is his ammo.
[00:21:02.302 --> 00:21:03.623]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:21:03.663 --> 00:21:05.323]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:21:05.664 --> 00:21:12.426]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:21:12.826 --> 00:21:13.247]  Some U.S.
[00:21:13.287 --> 00:21:18.949]  investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:21:19.649 --> 00:21:23.112]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:21:23.132 --> 00:21:33.401]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:21:33.622 --> 00:21:34.362]  Fabled enemies.

[00:23:38.156 --> 00:23:41.937]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:17.368 --> 00:24:18.889]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:18.989 --> 00:24:20.190]  We are here.
[00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:21.992]  We are live right now.
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:25.200]  Amazing!
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:29.742]  House votes down bill to bail out financial markets.
[00:24:29.822 --> 00:24:32.822]  Central banks try to keep crisis from spreading.
[00:24:32.882 --> 00:24:40.805]  Close to $1 trillion by the Federal Reserve pumped into the markets last week alone.
[00:24:40.825 --> 00:24:41.985]  $940 billion plus according to Reuters.
[00:24:45.686 --> 00:24:47.407]  And that was just last week alone.
[00:24:47.447 --> 00:24:49.228]  The same thing is going on right now.
[00:24:49.608 --> 00:24:54.030]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, ladies and gentlemen, previously closed at 11,143.
[00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:57.291]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average stands, an index of the top 30 stocks, at 10,691.21, a 451.92 drop, or 4.06% plunge.
[00:25:12.157 --> 00:25:13.519]  NASDAQ stands at 2,500.
[00:25:13.599 --> 00:25:14.880]  Remember back when it was at 5,000?
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:16.081]  At 1,000, it's dropped 127.36.
[00:25:16.121 --> 00:25:16.161]  S&P...
[00:25:25.376 --> 00:25:27.217]  Has dropped from 1 to 1147.76 or 65.25 change.
[00:25:27.237 --> 00:25:28.077]  Overall a 5.38 change in one day.
[00:25:28.117 --> 00:25:30.079]  And it is continuing to drop right now as we speak.
[00:25:30.099 --> 00:25:33.400]  We will continue to cover this as it all unfolds and develops.
[00:25:47.779 --> 00:25:48.640]  This is amazing.
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:54.063]  You had the entire Democrat and Republican leadership, for the last week and a half, fear-mongering.
[00:25:54.743 --> 00:25:56.184]  This is an amazing thing that's happened.
[00:25:56.985 --> 00:25:59.546]  Fear-mongering, saying there would be a depression.
[00:26:00.207 --> 00:26:01.908]  Paulson said that over the weekend again.
[00:26:02.248 --> 00:26:05.330]  Secretary of the Treasury, who's behind much of this.
[00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:06.430]  The cause of it.
[00:26:08.391 --> 00:26:12.074]  This is actually incredibly positive, what's happening right now.
[00:26:13.134 --> 00:26:17.157]  To have wall-to-wall fear-mongering, every major TV news show,
[00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:23.481]  Almost every radio talk show, the newspaper is saying, we need the bailout, we need the bailout, we need the bailout.
[00:26:24.041 --> 00:26:26.102]  Oh, it's not perfect, but it's the best thing we've got.
[00:26:27.722 --> 00:26:29.462]  Pushing it, and pushing it, and pushing it.
[00:26:30.723 --> 00:26:32.603]  And the Congress says no.
[00:26:33.463 --> 00:26:36.724]  Now, the Congress did narrowly say no, but still.
[00:26:38.264 --> 00:26:39.985]  Also, something positive is happening.
[00:26:40.365 --> 00:26:46.286]  Ron Paul is now all over radio and TV with people saying he was right, he predicted all of this.
[00:26:47.082 --> 00:26:48.683]  Same thing's happening for this radio show.
[00:26:49.764 --> 00:26:50.945]  Folks are saying we were right.
[00:26:51.246 --> 00:26:51.666]  We were.
[00:26:52.126 --> 00:26:53.668]  The credibility is just shooting up.
[00:26:54.348 --> 00:27:07.059]  So they're able to freeze him out of the presidential run to where he couldn't get that nomination, but now everybody remembers what Ron Paul said in the debates and all over television and in Congress to such an extent that Chuck Norris has written an editorial.
[00:27:08.641 --> 00:27:10.762]  Paul would point them out and I would choke them.
[00:27:11.863 --> 00:27:14.666]  Chuck Norris is defecting from being a neocon minion now.
[00:27:16.169 --> 00:27:23.019]  I've been told by folks that know Chuck Norris well, who I know that know him up in Dallas where he lives, that he is a closet patriot.
[00:27:23.459 --> 00:27:31.671]  Looks like he's taken the step of recusing himself from the neocons, just like we've seen Bruce Willis do.
[00:27:32.392 --> 00:27:51.283]  We told you here with director Rick Linklater that made a movie with him, that on the set he gave him a bunch of my videos, and Bruce said about a year and a half ago, I'm no longer a neocon, I've woken up to the left-right paradigm, and the people didn't believe it on this show, and then he went in Vanity Fair and talked about government-sponsored terror, and how the government killed Kennedy, and how he didn't trust Republicans or Democrats now.
[00:27:52.323 --> 00:27:58.167]  So Chuck Norris waking up, Bruce Willis, the point is they're canaries in the coal mine.
[00:27:59.335 --> 00:28:08.742]  If Chuck Norris were granted one wish, he would walk through Congress with Ron Paul and watch as Paul, the Republican representative from Texas, pointed out the corrupt politicians.
[00:28:09.183 --> 00:28:13.266]  One by one, Norris would grab each crooked congressman and choke him unconscious.
[00:28:13.966 --> 00:28:22.953]  I keep sticking them in a pile, piling them up to the martial arts star, who at 68 looks as young and bluff as the Walker, Texas Ranger.
[00:28:23.293 --> 00:28:23.894]  Glory days!
[00:28:25.315 --> 00:28:26.876]  The ones that are honest, they stay.
[00:28:27.156 --> 00:28:28.798]  This is the black belt patriotism.
[00:28:29.845 --> 00:28:34.069]  The Roundhouse Kick to the Point Political Philosophy.
[00:28:34.109 --> 00:28:36.692]  Norris explains in the new book of the same title.
[00:28:38.614 --> 00:28:39.595]  I actually have that book.
[00:28:39.655 --> 00:28:41.457]  It was in here and somebody got it out of my studio.
[00:28:42.554 --> 00:28:47.135]  The point is that even Chuck Norris now, waking up, I always knew he was a good guy.
[00:28:47.835 --> 00:28:49.936]  He just, it takes so much to wake these people up.
[00:28:50.456 --> 00:28:52.576]  See, we were telling you the truth the whole time.
[00:28:53.377 --> 00:28:55.197]  Oklahoma City was an inside job.
[00:28:55.597 --> 00:28:57.117]  Waco was a massacre.
[00:28:57.618 --> 00:29:00.718]  The first World Trade Center attack was government provocateur.
[00:29:00.738 --> 00:29:01.779]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:07.653]  And so Congress has said no to the bailout.
[00:29:07.733 --> 00:29:12.318]  Now they'll probably totally spike the stock market and say, okay, you better pass it.
[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:20.206]  Then they'll try to pass it and then maybe buoy it back up because the private Federal Reserve puts tens of billions a day into the stock market.
[00:29:20.527 --> 00:29:21.308]  Insider trading.
[00:29:21.948 --> 00:29:23.250]  Totally criminal, but they do it.
[00:29:26.454 --> 00:29:28.596]  So we will continue to break that down.
[00:29:28.656 --> 00:29:30.398]  Bob Dacey in studio when we get back.
[00:29:30.758 --> 00:29:34.102]  I'm going to hit on some other news items that are developing and unfolding.
[00:29:34.502 --> 00:29:39.207]  And then we're also going to continue taking your phone calls.
[00:29:39.907 --> 00:29:40.808]  We're on the march.
[00:29:41.309 --> 00:29:42.890]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:43.831 --> 00:29:46.514]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:49.878 --> 00:29:52.919]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:55.360]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[00:29:55.601 --> 00:29:58.622]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[00:29:58.902 --> 00:30:05.405]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[00:30:05.785 --> 00:30:07.906]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[00:30:08.406 --> 00:30:11.488]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[00:30:11.688 --> 00:30:16.331]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[00:30:16.471 --> 00:30:20.173]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[00:30:20.413 --> 00:30:21.934]  Travel less, meet online.

[00:30:51.974 --> 00:30:54.377]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:30:54.397 --> 00:30:57.000]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:58.201]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:30:58.221 --> 00:30:59.863]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:30:59.943 --> 00:31:02.786]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:31:02.826 --> 00:31:06.470]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:31:16.119 --> 00:31:21.024]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:31:22.245 --> 00:31:23.366]  An inside job.
[00:31:24.782 --> 00:31:26.123]  How dare you?
[00:31:27.204 --> 00:31:32.268]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:31:32.288 --> 00:31:35.090]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:41.374]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[00:31:46.758 --> 00:31:49.240]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:31:50.222 --> 00:31:53.585]  Are you sick and tired of spending your hard-earned money to fill your gas tank?
[00:31:53.925 --> 00:31:55.286]  Then do something about it!
[00:31:55.586 --> 00:31:59.089]  Fuel Saver's Fuel Conditioner lets you drive further on each gallon of fuel.
[00:31:59.389 --> 00:32:01.070]  Completely safe for all engines.

[00:32:44.143 --> 00:32:45.664]  Call now.
[00:32:45.724 --> 00:32:54.611]  Pienso que un sueño parasito no volverá más.
[00:32:54.691 --> 00:33:00.936]  Que me pintaba las manos y la cara azul.
[00:33:02.798 --> 00:33:06.741]  Y de proviso en el viento la vida me devolverá.
[00:33:09.318 --> 00:33:10.659]  We're good.
[00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:35.243]  The stock market just dropped 35 points plus in the last five minutes.
[00:34:00.342 --> 00:34:09.747]  So, uh, that's not going well on news of the Congress saying they're not going to give the private banks that caused all these problems a free ride.
[00:34:09.847 --> 00:34:13.689]  Bob Dacey will be with us for the rest of the broadcast, about an hour and twenty minutes of it.
[00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:19.973]  For the next five minutes, I wanted to bring Ted Anderson on, not to say, see, I told you so.
[00:34:20.033 --> 00:34:23.595]  In fact, for those watching me on PrisonPlanet.tv, they can see me dancing around with the music.
[00:34:24.457 --> 00:34:33.199]  I'm making myself be positive, I'm making myself be happy, I'm making myself not be negative here, because I'm very very upset about what's happening.
[00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:49.223]  This could turn into a road warrior type economic collapse, because the fact that we're 90 plus percent urban, no longer agrarian, 7 million people according to different studies that have been done by universities, 7 plus million starved to death during the decade of depression.
[00:34:50.163 --> 00:34:52.684]  And this is very predatory of what's being set up.
[00:34:52.704 --> 00:35:00.607]  This has been engineered by design, and then they want to, through the crisis they create, create a world dictatorship of the banks.
[00:35:00.687 --> 00:35:03.328]  And Henry Kissinger and others called for that last week.
[00:35:03.348 --> 00:35:10.471]  There were stories up on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.net by Steve Watson on that, with their quotes and videos of them saying it.
[00:35:11.631 --> 00:35:19.876]  How many years have we said they'll create a world economic crisis based in the U.S., then offer a new global economic order to deal with the last scam they ran?
[00:35:19.956 --> 00:35:23.538]  A new Ponzi scheme for the old one now coming to an end.
[00:35:23.558 --> 00:35:24.999]  So we're at a very important crossroads.
[00:35:25.039 --> 00:35:33.504]  And I thought the House was going to pass the economic bailout of the bankers, the takeover bill, the criminal stick-up bill, but it didn't.
[00:35:34.244 --> 00:35:45.303]  And I said last week, if that didn't happen, then they would just plunge the market, because the Federal Reserve has been propping it up for years with our tax money every day, with the Plunge Protection Team, the Committee on Open Markets that they set up back in the 80s.
[00:35:46.952 --> 00:35:53.318]  And that they would then let it crash, then pump it back up when people finally acquiesce.
[00:35:53.418 --> 00:35:55.220]  That remains to now be seen.
[00:35:56.441 --> 00:35:58.983]  So this is a big defeat for the New World Order right now.
[00:35:59.784 --> 00:36:01.345]  Will they now do as they've threatened?
[00:36:01.385 --> 00:36:04.729]  Yelling fire in a theater, screaming, depression, depression, depression.
[00:36:05.109 --> 00:36:10.194]  If we didn't give them anonymity, immunity, and by anonymity they could secretly
[00:36:11.203 --> 00:36:11.843]  Do whatever they wanted.
[00:36:12.084 --> 00:36:13.785]  Bob Daisy's got all the documents on that.
[00:36:14.165 --> 00:36:16.247]  And his big thing is the Federal Reserve.
[00:36:16.267 --> 00:36:21.191]  By the way, we carry the three and a half hour documentary, The Money Masters, on one DVD.
[00:36:21.531 --> 00:36:22.512]  The definitive film.
[00:36:23.527 --> 00:36:25.649]  Yes, you know all about it, listeners, but your neighbor doesn't.
[00:36:25.669 --> 00:36:29.814]  Give them the pretty DVD with the cover and say, do you want to be an expert on this?
[00:36:29.914 --> 00:36:31.596]  Well, the next three nights, watch an hour of it.
[00:36:46.611 --> 00:36:49.333]  And people used to, I don't care about that, the Cowboys are on.
[00:36:49.633 --> 00:36:51.854]  They just lost to the Redskins.
[00:36:51.874 --> 00:36:52.855]  This is a disaster.
[00:36:53.395 --> 00:36:56.497]  Well, maybe now they will care and check it out.
[00:36:56.517 --> 00:36:57.178]  And the answer is yes.
[00:36:57.358 --> 00:36:59.900]  But I want to bring Ted Anderson up for five minutes.
[00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:03.662]  Ted, hate to say, gee, we told you so, but we're right again.
[00:37:04.162 --> 00:37:06.624]  And gold is exploding in price today.
[00:37:07.104 --> 00:37:09.165]  And folks, it may go up and down in the months to come.
[00:37:09.186 --> 00:37:10.967]  But bottom line, the dollar is a dead duck.
[00:37:11.807 --> 00:37:12.387]  I don't know.
[00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:31.971]  The dollar is a dead duck with the bailouts we've already seen.
[00:37:31.991 --> 00:37:35.652]  If they would have done this bailout, which they may still do, guaranteed even faster.
[00:37:36.272 --> 00:37:38.252]  But Ted, give me your take on what's happening right now.
[00:37:38.512 --> 00:37:39.332]  Oh, I sure will.
[00:37:39.792 --> 00:37:42.753]  I think it's just a victory for Congress not to do this.
[00:37:42.793 --> 00:37:49.274]  That doesn't mean the dollar is going to be saved, but at least we're not handing it over to the banks right now at this time.
[00:37:49.334 --> 00:37:50.975]  Wall Street's not getting bailed out.
[00:37:51.395 --> 00:37:57.076]  Yes, indeed, there's going to be some very severe consequences on Main Street where you and I are trying to live.
[00:37:58.045 --> 00:38:01.186]  The bank's not lending money means the money supply is going to shrink.
[00:38:01.246 --> 00:38:02.246]  It's going to get very tough.
[00:38:02.806 --> 00:38:03.346]  Very tough.
[00:38:03.406 --> 00:38:06.107]  A depression style like we had in the 1930s.
[00:38:06.627 --> 00:38:10.948]  Of course, there still will be a bailout, just like they said.
[00:38:11.428 --> 00:38:12.228]  The U.S.
[00:38:12.288 --> 00:38:14.129]  government has FDIC to cover.
[00:38:14.189 --> 00:38:18.530]  They have all the welfare programs to cover, the unemployment programs to cover.
[00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:20.670]  They're going to be shifting a lot of new money.
[00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:23.631]  They just passed a trillion dollar defense budget last week.
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:26.421]  So this is what it comes down to.
[00:38:26.481 --> 00:38:29.202]  We got problems, but at least we're not billing out the banks.
[00:38:29.282 --> 00:38:37.145]  We are going to see the dollar fall, and it's going to become... I doubt it a bit if we're still trading Federal Reserve notes even ten years from now.
[00:38:37.385 --> 00:38:39.526]  And folks, I know you like to procrastinate.
[00:38:40.006 --> 00:38:43.388]  Oh, they'll try to have them, Amaro, within four years, I believe, a lot of experts believe.
[00:38:44.529 --> 00:38:54.615]  I'm looking right now at the gold numbers from CNBC and gold is up $27 plus today at $9.04.80.
[00:38:55.475 --> 00:38:54.615]  $9.04.80.
[00:38:57.897 --> 00:39:00.478]  And people, you think that's high?
[00:39:00.998 --> 00:39:02.539]  This is a buying opportunity.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.562]  Gold always goes up in the fall and winter.
[00:39:07.362 --> 00:39:10.384]  And it is way undervalued.
[00:39:11.805 --> 00:39:13.126]  It is undervalued right now, Alex.
[00:39:13.146 --> 00:39:14.207]  There's no question about it.
[00:39:14.507 --> 00:39:15.928]  But here's another kicker for you.
[00:39:16.309 --> 00:39:17.089]  When gold was what?
[00:39:17.109 --> 00:39:20.992]  It was $9.87, $9.78 right in there and we're offering things last week.
[00:39:21.372 --> 00:39:22.934]  We've got the same prices right now.
[00:39:23.274 --> 00:39:25.155]  People can get at the very same items.
[00:39:25.575 --> 00:39:31.220]  I was able to hold on to that level because I was watching this thing happen and I just knew I had to accumulate.
[00:39:32.608 --> 00:39:37.191]  And set up an opportunity for my people to buy once the market price... Yeah, let's be clear about that.
[00:39:37.231 --> 00:39:37.751]  Let's stop.
[00:39:37.771 --> 00:39:40.673]  I want everyone to listen very carefully.
[00:39:41.533 --> 00:39:45.256]  Ted, last Friday, couldn't even talk to me on the phone when I called him in the afternoon.
[00:39:46.016 --> 00:39:50.719]  The owner of the Genesis Network, same big building Midas Resources is in.
[00:39:51.019 --> 00:39:52.560]  Ted's been in this almost 30 years.
[00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:54.301]  Had Midas for, what, 12?
[00:39:55.201 --> 00:39:58.103]  And Ted couldn't talk to me.
[00:39:58.143 --> 00:39:59.244]  He said, look, I'm too busy.
[00:40:00.501 --> 00:40:09.644]  I'm making some buys right now while gold is only at $8.75 because I believe it's going to explode next week whether they do the bailout or not.
[00:40:10.124 --> 00:40:12.045]  And boy was Ted Wright, it's up $27 from the close
[00:40:16.658 --> 00:40:17.198]  Friday.
[00:40:17.218 --> 00:40:23.562]  And so, Ted, you're saying you've got gold at how much below spot?
[00:40:23.642 --> 00:40:24.362]  Same prices.
[00:40:24.382 --> 00:40:25.983]  $2.41 on the British Sovereigns.
[00:40:26.003 --> 00:40:30.946]  That's about $20 below what it would cost if I entered into the marketplace to buy the same thing at this time.
[00:40:31.426 --> 00:40:32.907]  I still have the Franks right now.
[00:40:32.927 --> 00:40:33.928]  They're at $1.96.
[00:40:34.788 --> 00:40:39.130]  That's the same price I offered them on Friday, and gold's gone up like crazy.
[00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:42.832]  And obviously, silver is about to make an explosive move, too.
[00:40:43.393 --> 00:40:45.534]  And I still have the dimes right now.
[00:40:45.973 --> 00:40:49.158]  That's $1,600 per face, you know, per $100 face.
[00:40:49.598 --> 00:40:55.868]  And I gotta tell you right now, Alex, there's just way, way, way too much trouble out there to ignore this buy.
[00:40:55.908 --> 00:40:57.189]  This is one of the better buys.
[00:40:57.770 --> 00:40:59.553]  I would say it's one of the best buys I've ever done.
[00:41:00.026 --> 00:41:08.748]  Except for that one time on Monday I locked in, and gold shot up eighty-some bucks that day, but I don't know, that's the only time gold's ever done that in history.
[00:41:09.168 --> 00:41:16.569]  And right now, it's up thirty bucks, this whole thing's melting down, and we don't know what the market is going to carry forward to the rest of today.
[00:41:16.589 --> 00:41:26.491]  That's right, and the futures show it only going up as well, and so I think it's safe to say that, well, gold's broken the psychological of nine hundred and is sailing up
[00:41:27.271 --> 00:41:27.972]  On its way towards $1,000.
[00:41:28.593 --> 00:41:31.495]  Ted, how long do you think until it potentially hits $1,000?
[00:41:31.755 --> 00:41:36.320]  Well, you know, obviously if we break through that $900 level, we could see $1,000 in three days.
[00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:37.761]  It could go that quick.
[00:41:37.941 --> 00:41:41.765]  I mean, we went $85 up in one day, and then we're up over $130 within two.
[00:41:43.126 --> 00:41:48.987]  And folks, you know, I've bought gold and silver over the years, a little bit here, a little bit there, and invested it and done things with it.
[00:41:49.287 --> 00:41:52.288]  And I bought gold when it was $264, and it was $300 when it was $400, $500, $600, $700, $800.
[00:41:53.248 --> 00:41:55.569]  I bought gold from Ted when it was $1,000.
[00:41:55.969 --> 00:41:58.309]  Did I sell it when it went down to $800 and something?
[00:41:58.349 --> 00:41:58.509]  No.
[00:41:58.929 --> 00:42:01.750]  I kept it because it's my insurance policy.
[00:42:01.810 --> 00:42:03.330]  The Federal Reserve notes are dead.
[00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:11.872]  We could be in a depression next week, God forbid, but in the future, every economist we have on says within two to three years, the worst depression we've ever seen,
[00:42:12.632 --> 00:42:15.193]  And now is the time to move out of dollars.
[00:42:15.273 --> 00:42:24.718]  Now is the time to get out of the bank and get out of paper, because this derivatives bubble that is over one thousand trillion, over a quadrillion, it is not going away, period.
[00:42:25.058 --> 00:42:28.219]  So you are insane if you don't move into gold and silver.
[00:42:28.299 --> 00:42:38.224]  And if you are moving into gold and silver and metals, you are even more insane not to get it from Ted Anderson right now, who has it in his vault, who got it
[00:42:38.944 --> 00:42:41.086]  When gold was down $30, okay?
[00:42:41.586 --> 00:42:42.467]  It is up $30.
[00:42:42.767 --> 00:42:45.829]  He made a major buy, Thursday and Friday made buys.
[00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:49.672]  Ladies and gentlemen, he has the gold, he has the silver, but here's the problem.
[00:42:50.133 --> 00:42:58.619]  Ted's told me he's having trouble getting the gold and silver in these really good coins because, and there's a lot of articles about real scarcity in gold.
[00:42:58.879 --> 00:43:01.001]  They're trying to suppress it and can't suppress the price.
[00:43:02.025 --> 00:43:06.451]  But they're suppressing it from where it should be at above $2,000 for inflation from 1980 numbers.
[00:43:06.792 --> 00:43:11.599]  But physically in this market, in the real market, they're running out of gold and silver.
[00:43:11.719 --> 00:43:13.902]  I mean, look, just last week the U.S.
[00:43:14.042 --> 00:43:15.525]  Mint suspended gold sales.
[00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.630]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:17.451]  That's what's going on.
[00:43:17.811 --> 00:43:21.833]  When you watch that volatility, it means that the futures market is bouncing up and down.
[00:43:21.853 --> 00:43:24.634]  But that's all paper, and it's all credit and leverage.
[00:43:24.674 --> 00:43:29.877]  I mean, for God's sakes, there are only 10 cents on the dollars there to back the trades that are going through.
[00:43:30.357 --> 00:43:33.598]  And when that goes down and that goes up, that doesn't affect the physical market.
[00:43:33.638 --> 00:43:36.680]  Like you, Alex, people are buying this stuff and they're holding on to it.
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:41.302]  Just because they paid a thousand bucks for it doesn't mean they're willing to sell it when gold's down in the $780 range.
[00:43:43.516 --> 00:43:45.677]  And now it's just bouncing right back up again.
[00:43:46.298 --> 00:43:47.558]  In fact, from $780 to $905, it just went up again.
[00:43:47.578 --> 00:43:49.599]  We're talking about a massive increase here.
[00:43:49.619 --> 00:43:51.981]  We're talking about a $125 increase in the last two weeks.
[00:43:52.001 --> 00:43:55.863]  Most of the countries around the world quit coining gold and silver coins
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:10.882]  Back in World War II.
[00:44:11.302 --> 00:44:20.935]  I mean, yeah, you got the Eagles, you got some, you know, the Canadian Maple Leaf, and this kind of adds a little bit of supply to the market, but it's nothing in comparison to what it used to be like.
[00:44:21.275 --> 00:44:24.960]  The supply of gold and silver is drying up, especially silver.
[00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:26.081]  But gold is too!
[00:44:40.276 --> 00:44:41.637]  Bullion prices.
[00:44:42.037 --> 00:44:44.578]  You cannot beat this, and I believe in it.
[00:44:44.678 --> 00:44:50.440]  And Ted literally lost money on one of the pitches he did a week and a half ago when it went up 80-something bucks in one day.
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:53.041]  He still fulfilled it all, did it all.
[00:44:53.421 --> 00:44:58.383]  Ted has locked in on these so he won't lose money because he locked in with his gamble.
[00:44:58.883 --> 00:45:01.324]  But he is passing that savings on.
[00:45:01.384 --> 00:45:05.425]  This is the second best deal I've ever heard Ted offer.
[00:45:06.146 --> 00:45:10.267]  And if it keeps going up today, Ted is locked in so he can still offer it to you.
[00:45:10.507 --> 00:45:11.908]  How long can you hold this deal, Ted?
[00:45:12.028 --> 00:45:14.128]  I'll honor these transactions till midnight.
[00:45:14.268 --> 00:45:15.089]  And Alex, you're right.
[00:45:15.149 --> 00:45:20.070]  Last time around I locked in a position I must have sold ten times as much as I locked in on.
[00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:21.051]  But I'll honor it.
[00:45:21.091 --> 00:45:25.372]  I'll honor every single one of these trades because people need to have gold.
[00:45:25.632 --> 00:45:27.673]  And when I give my word, my word is my word.
[00:45:28.683 --> 00:45:29.944]  And I can't say it enough.
[00:45:30.004 --> 00:45:35.667]  Gold's up 30 bucks and I'm offering the same stuff at the same prices I was last week when gold was lower.
[00:45:35.787 --> 00:45:36.727]  Absolutely amazing.
[00:45:36.767 --> 00:45:37.728]  Ted, let's give them the number.
[00:45:37.748 --> 00:45:37.788]  1-800-686.
[00:45:37.808 --> 00:45:38.568]  Give them the number, Ted.
[00:45:38.588 --> 00:45:39.309]  Yeah, 1-800-686-2237.
[00:45:39.329 --> 00:45:39.549]  It's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:45:48.029 --> 00:45:49.110]  2-2-3-7.
[00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:51.031]  Man, you want to get involved with this now.
[00:45:51.371 --> 00:45:55.594]  And if you don't have the brains to get out of paper now, you don't deserve to have gold.
[00:45:55.814 --> 00:45:56.515]  You know what I'm saying?
[00:45:56.755 --> 00:46:00.137]  There's just way too many... Well, a lot of us are just so busy, we don't have time to do it.
[00:46:00.177 --> 00:46:03.399]  But, I mean, I've been meaning to get some for two weeks, knowing it was going up.
[00:46:03.439 --> 00:46:08.443]  And I've been too busy to go scrabble around and get money out of the children's savings account to go get it.
[00:46:08.523 --> 00:46:09.864]  But I've got to do that today, Ted.
[00:46:09.904 --> 00:46:14.186]  Now, I'm... I mean, I'm 120 bucks down on this announcement, because I've just been too busy.
[00:46:14.467 --> 00:46:15.327]  Folks, don't wait.
[00:46:15.347 --> 00:46:15.387]  1-800-686.
[00:46:18.069 --> 00:46:19.190]  Two, two, three, seven.
[00:46:19.690 --> 00:46:24.092]  The brokers will be there until midnight tonight.
[00:46:24.112 --> 00:46:24.692]  800-686-2237.
[00:46:25.273 --> 00:46:25.933]  Do not wait.
[00:46:26.033 --> 00:46:27.654]  Lock it in today.
[00:46:27.794 --> 00:46:30.775]  Gold is only going up as we speak.
[00:46:30.996 --> 00:46:36.258]  One more time, that toll-free number, and I'm refreshing the gold price right now.
[00:46:36.278 --> 00:46:38.419]  I'm going to give that number out to everybody.
[00:46:38.439 --> 00:46:38.780]  800-686-2237.
[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:41.321]  Gold just went up another three dollars, Ted.
[00:46:46.504 --> 00:46:48.686]  That's what it's doing right now, and it's just reacting.
[00:46:48.746 --> 00:46:51.509]  It's saying, OK, we're not going to get the bailout.
[00:46:51.609 --> 00:46:56.494]  If we did get the bailout, we'd have so much currency coming into the system, it would be coming by the buckets full.
[00:46:56.634 --> 00:46:58.716]  But for the time being, gold would have probably sat still.
[00:46:59.037 --> 00:47:00.358]  Now as it is, boom.
[00:47:00.378 --> 00:47:00.658]  800-686-2237.
[00:47:02.721 --> 00:47:05.403]  Gold up three bucks in the last five minutes.
[00:47:05.684 --> 00:47:06.625]  Ted, thanks for coming on.
[00:47:06.845 --> 00:47:07.806]  Thanks for having me on, Alex.
[00:47:08.466 --> 00:47:12.768]  It's at $907 right now, or up right at $30 today.
[00:47:12.868 --> 00:47:14.548]  Okay, he's with us until the end of the show.
[00:47:14.628 --> 00:47:19.850]  Coming up later, I'm going to go to your calls on the economy and what's happening, and we'll cover things as they develop.
[00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:33.814]  Bob Dacey really is an expert on the Federal Reserve in the now decade-plus that he has been studying what's going on and what has been happening, and I'm pleased to have Bob Dacey in studio with us.
[00:47:33.874 --> 00:47:35.295]  Bob, it's good to have you here, my friend.
[00:47:35.655 --> 00:47:37.076]  Alex, it's been a while since I've been in here.
[00:47:37.216 --> 00:47:38.177]  I'm glad to be back.
[00:47:38.237 --> 00:47:46.704]  That's right, and folks know Bob has sat in on quite a few shows and done an excellent job, other than speaking too softly, and my guys didn't turn his mic up, but he is just awesome.
[00:47:47.285 --> 00:47:54.891]  We've got about three or four minutes before break, but let's go ahead and get into your bottom line take on what's happening with the banker bailout.
[00:47:55.011 --> 00:47:56.352]  Well, I've got to tell you something, Alex.
[00:47:56.432 --> 00:47:58.112]  I'm a little bit confused right now.
[00:47:58.192 --> 00:48:00.493]  I was betting on them voting for this thing anyway.
[00:48:00.973 --> 00:48:17.000]  I mean, I called my congressman and my senators every single day for the last week, and very calmly, like I always do, explained why there's no way they should vote for this, and I'm sure it was going on all over the country, but I'm trying to figure out, and I don't understand, this is one of these anatomical anomalies.
[00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:17.600]  How did
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:26.886]  A creature without a spine walk erect and then develop a spine and actually develop some cojones and actually vote the right way.
[00:48:26.966 --> 00:48:28.267]  I'm confused by that.
[00:48:28.287 --> 00:48:36.032]  I'm actually thinking that this gigantic amount of pressure that we the people put on these creatures actually might have had an effect.
[00:48:36.573 --> 00:48:43.638]  I'm a little concerned that they're going to try to pull something else out of the hat before, you know... No, they're going to crash it and say it's our fault.
[00:48:44.258 --> 00:48:45.759]  I mean, that's why they blame it on the subprime.
[00:48:45.779 --> 00:48:46.939]  It's always about blaming us.
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:56.404]  Well, it's always our fault, but the thing that people have to understand, and this is the bottom line, and Alex is right about this, they're not really trying to fix anything.
[00:48:56.464 --> 00:49:00.327]  I mean, they are trying to tank the economy one way or another.
[00:49:01.027 --> 00:49:03.088]  It's a highway robbery.
[00:49:03.148 --> 00:49:03.728]  It's a theft.
[00:49:04.469 --> 00:49:05.249]  And that's all it is.
[00:49:05.729 --> 00:49:07.650]  It's Gilbert Griffin's book.
[00:49:09.474 --> 00:49:12.555]  The Creature from Jekyll Island, Chapter 2, explains it really well, you know.
[00:49:13.496 --> 00:49:14.777]  The name of the game is bailout.
[00:49:14.857 --> 00:49:17.838]  Well, this time, they're not bailing out this, but they're bailing out everything else.
[00:49:18.518 --> 00:49:20.119]  And again, I am confused.
[00:49:20.179 --> 00:49:20.859]  I have to admit it.
[00:49:20.879 --> 00:49:21.820]  I do not understand.
[00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:33.125]  And by the way, I haven't pointed out in weeks that the Bush's specialty, all of them have different criminal specialties, but it's all about raiding SNLs, blowing out savings and loans, robbing banks, you know, being bank directors.
[00:49:33.465 --> 00:49:36.447]  I mean, that's the Bush specialty, and McCain's specialty.
[00:49:36.627 --> 00:49:38.108]  Financing dictators, don't forget that.
[00:49:39.889 --> 00:49:40.330]  Yeah.
[00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:43.153]  So, like I say, I'm a little bit confused.
[00:49:43.173 --> 00:49:46.016]  I mean, just before I got on the air, we found out that the House voted against it.
[00:49:46.276 --> 00:49:48.579]  Well, now the Senate's not going to be able to vote on anything, are they?
[00:49:49.335 --> 00:49:49.555]  Right?
[00:49:49.775 --> 00:49:54.699]  And people are asking, because it's the end of the fiscal year, they're about to go away on a holiday recess.
[00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:56.481]  Good.
[00:49:56.941 --> 00:49:57.782]  I mean, let it tank.
[00:49:57.802 --> 00:49:58.482]  Let it implode.
[00:49:58.842 --> 00:50:02.205]  Because letting it tank later will only make it worse, folks.
[00:50:02.245 --> 00:50:07.249]  They're saying, we owe all this money, and it's going to devalue the currency that is in the real economy.
[00:50:07.549 --> 00:50:08.970]  Main Street versus Wall Street.
[00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:09.891]  You want to explain that to people?
[00:50:10.431 --> 00:50:12.213]  Well, Main Street versus Wall Street.
[00:50:12.233 --> 00:50:14.534]  I'll give you a great example of Main Street versus Wall Street.
[00:50:14.574 --> 00:50:19.138]  The logic must have been so ridiculous that even the congressman must have been able to figure it out.
[00:50:19.838 --> 00:50:29.282]  What they're proposing to do, according to Bernanke, was to buy this stuff back, all these bad mortgages, at what their market value was in more normal times.
[00:50:29.782 --> 00:50:35.184]  So you've got a $100,000 mortgage that's worth $60,000 now, and they're going to take taxpayer money and spend $100,000 on it.
[00:50:35.204 --> 00:50:37.905]  That doesn't make sense to anybody.
[00:50:39.865 --> 00:50:43.327]  And if we're going to be complete socialists, why be socialists for the billionaire bankers?
[00:50:43.787 --> 00:50:48.929]  I mean, if we're going to do this, if we're going to be paying interest on this, this is a credit card, then we might as well be able to buy the crap.
[00:50:53.882 --> 00:50:55.382]  The stock market is crazy.
[00:50:55.743 --> 00:50:58.043]  The chemtrails are spraying us with their chemicals.
[00:50:58.684 --> 00:51:00.424]  It's time to think about what is important.
[00:51:01.024 --> 00:51:03.225]  Most forget just how important life is.
[00:51:03.925 --> 00:51:10.447]  Life Change Tea removes toxins, chemicals, parasites, and bacteria that store up in your body.
[00:51:10.868 --> 00:51:13.648]  It cleanses you and gives you results in hours.

[00:51:18.795 --> 00:51:19.275]  That's right!

[00:51:20.496 --> 00:51:24.300]  And on top of that, there's a 45-day money-back guarantee.
[00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:25.360]  So why wait?

[00:51:26.361 --> 00:51:27.622]  Operators are standing by.

[00:51:28.583 --> 00:51:34.828]  I'll say it again.
[00:51:34.848 --> 00:51:35.509]  928-308-0408.
[00:51:35.709 --> 00:51:40.293]  Or order online at GetTheTee.com.

[00:51:42.955 --> 00:51:46.498]  And remember, the stock market may crash, but you don't have to go with it.
[00:51:49.901 --> 00:51:56.286]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:51:56.646 --> 00:51:58.627]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:51:59.288 --> 00:52:00.328]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:00.849 --> 00:52:01.369]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:01.649 --> 00:52:02.550]  This is his ammo.
[00:52:02.570 --> 00:52:03.971]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:04.011 --> 00:52:05.632]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:05.992 --> 00:52:12.757]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:13.157 --> 00:52:13.598]  Some U.S.
[00:52:13.638 --> 00:52:19.322]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:19.982 --> 00:52:23.444]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:23.464 --> 00:52:33.730]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:34.690]  Fabled enemies.

[00:53:13.257 --> 00:53:15.619]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[00:53:15.979 --> 00:53:18.081]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[00:53:18.101 --> 00:53:18.601]  this fall?
[00:53:19.081 --> 00:53:19.602]  Don't wait.

[00:53:52.944 --> 00:54:01.530]  Okay, we are back live on the MNFM Dial Global Shortwave, the Internet at InfoWars.com and streaming live at PrisonPlanet.tv to all the folks there.
[00:54:01.550 --> 00:54:03.832]  I want to thank the PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:54:03.872 --> 00:54:07.594]  You make so much of what we do possible here with your membership.
[00:54:09.195 --> 00:54:14.379]  Okay, Bob, you've got a lot of notes there, a lot of news and points you want to make, and I want to get the calls coming up in the next hour.
[00:54:14.679 --> 00:54:15.760]  Start breaking it down for us.
[00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:19.803]  Well, you know, we're talking about the history of this thing, you know, and this goes way back over a hundred years.
[00:54:20.643 --> 00:54:23.069]  I think you were on my show many, many, many years ago.
[00:54:23.089 --> 00:54:26.979]  By the way, that's the Simple Truth TV show here in Austin.
[00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:29.746]  We have a website now by the way, simpletruthonline.net.
[00:54:30.697 --> 00:54:35.662]  We have a webmaster, we've got a reporter, we've got two producers, and we've got five people working on our show now.
[00:54:35.802 --> 00:54:36.182]  Good job!
[00:54:36.423 --> 00:54:37.544]  SimpleTruthOnline.net.
[00:54:38.024 --> 00:54:40.347]  But this thing goes back way over a hundred years.
[00:54:40.687 --> 00:54:54.601]  Cecil Rhodes, the super-rich guy from way back in the good old days, 1890s and whatnot, he was the one that went over to South Africa and he founded De Beers, just super-rich, kicked a bunch of Africans off their land, the Metabiti tribe, and got their
[00:54:55.061 --> 00:54:57.862]  Got their gold and stuff and all that.
[00:54:58.222 --> 00:55:05.084]  This guy was one of the super rich guys back then and when he died he had a will and in his will he set up the Rhodes Scholarship.
[00:55:05.525 --> 00:55:07.145]  You just think that's for a bunch of smart people.
[00:55:07.185 --> 00:55:21.890]  Well no, the Rhodes Scholarship program was set up as a recruiting ground for elitists and his fondest desire according to his biographer was to gradually absorb the wealth of the world into the hands of the few.
[00:55:22.868 --> 00:55:34.902]  And from the Rhodes Trust and all that came financing for the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London and its cousin over here in the United States, the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:55:35.542 --> 00:55:39.547]  And this is not something which is debatable.
[00:55:39.787 --> 00:55:40.348]  They admit it.
[00:55:40.848 --> 00:55:43.271]  They admit it in the book Tragedy and Hope.
[00:55:45.110 --> 00:55:45.731]  What's his name?
[00:55:45.871 --> 00:55:46.391]  Give me his name.
[00:55:46.451 --> 00:55:47.191]  I just forgot it.
[00:55:47.772 --> 00:55:48.532]  Carol Quigley.
[00:55:48.552 --> 00:55:49.213]  Carol Quigley.
[00:55:49.673 --> 00:55:51.294]  Carol Quigley wrote about it in the 60's.
[00:55:51.334 --> 00:55:52.435]  He was a member of the CFR.
[00:55:52.495 --> 00:55:53.495]  He said it all.
[00:55:53.555 --> 00:55:54.076]  It's in the book.
[00:55:54.156 --> 00:55:55.517]  It's funny you brought this up.
[00:55:56.297 --> 00:55:59.159]  Because I meant Sunday to have time to get to this.
[00:55:59.799 --> 00:56:01.120]  I'll put it up on screen for people.
[00:56:01.660 --> 00:56:02.841]  I meant to get to this.
[00:56:04.222 --> 00:56:06.183]  The New World Order Conspiracy Theory.
[00:56:06.884 --> 00:56:08.345]  This is Wikipedia.
[00:56:09.321 --> 00:56:21.770]  And it goes on to say it refers to a purported conspiracy in which a powerful and secretive group is plotting to eventually rule the world via an autonomous world government, which would replace sovereign states and other checks and balances in world power struggles.
[00:56:22.625 --> 00:56:34.575]  And it goes on to say it's an imaginary theory, but then when you start reading it, it gets into Cecil Rhodes' book, Cecil Rhodes' will, a New World Order set up for the British Empire with the United States and Anglo-American establishment.
[00:56:35.015 --> 00:56:42.722]  Then it goes through all the books written by the elites and the real groups they set up to do it, and all the presidents that have called for it and prime ministers.
[00:56:43.382 --> 00:56:44.604]  But it still doesn't exist, Bob.
[00:56:44.624 --> 00:56:48.190]  Well, that's because of the definition of conspiracy.
[00:56:48.671 --> 00:56:53.099]  I mean, you can have all these people telling you about all these horrible things, but a conspiracy is obviously kooks.
[00:56:53.997 --> 00:56:57.899]  They've conditioned the American people into thinking that anybody who uses that word is a kook.
[00:56:58.319 --> 00:56:59.800]  But all a conspiracy is, is what?
[00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:02.581]  Two or more people conspiring to do something that's wrong?
[00:57:02.821 --> 00:57:03.442]  That's all it is!
[00:57:03.982 --> 00:57:13.467]  And when Cecil Rhodes puts it in his will, and by the way, one of the things in his will was he wanted to recruit people through this Rhodes Scholarship Fund of what he called unctuous rectitude.
[00:57:13.527 --> 00:57:14.707]  Nobody uses that word anymore.
[00:57:15.228 --> 00:57:16.548]  Unctuous means slippery.
[00:57:17.749 --> 00:57:20.070]  In common parlance, it means used car salesman.
[00:57:20.888 --> 00:57:24.849]  And, you know, what do you figure about... What's his name?
[00:57:24.889 --> 00:57:25.610]  Bill Clinton?
[00:57:26.010 --> 00:57:27.070]  I mean, that's what he is.
[00:57:27.090 --> 00:57:28.231]  He's a used car salesman.
[00:57:28.951 --> 00:57:30.611]  Jimmy Carter was a used car salesman.
[00:57:31.052 --> 00:57:33.572]  Barack Obama is the latest used car salesman.
[00:57:33.873 --> 00:57:34.393]  They're slick.
[00:57:34.673 --> 00:57:35.673]  They're polished.
[00:57:35.953 --> 00:57:37.894]  They're very well educated.
[00:57:38.334 --> 00:57:40.175]  And they're working for global government.
[00:57:40.335 --> 00:57:40.675]  All of them.
[00:57:41.826 --> 00:57:44.307]  And it doesn't matter if you have North American Union documents.
[00:57:44.327 --> 00:57:47.048]  It doesn't matter if you have presidents calling for world government.
[00:57:47.068 --> 00:57:49.489]  It doesn't matter if all these corporations are calling for it.
[00:57:49.869 --> 00:57:52.250]  They just respond to us by saying it doesn't exist.
[00:57:52.330 --> 00:57:58.772]  And Wikipedia basically says it doesn't exist, but then goes on to show all the elitists saying it does exist.
[00:57:58.792 --> 00:58:03.894]  You know, there was a book written a few years ago about, what was it, trying to
[00:58:05.943 --> 00:58:10.646]  Oh, it was taking over all these countries with economic means.
[00:58:10.686 --> 00:58:11.407]  I forgot the name of the author.
[00:58:11.427 --> 00:58:12.207]  Well, it's Super Clash.
[00:58:12.287 --> 00:58:13.928]  It's written by the head of the Kissinger Group.
[00:58:13.948 --> 00:58:16.110]  He came on the show and said, yeah, we're setting all this up.
[00:58:16.310 --> 00:58:19.652]  But then they say it's not a conspiracy, like it happens by osmosis or something.
[00:58:20.132 --> 00:58:21.013]  Global governance.
[00:58:21.133 --> 00:58:24.355]  Well, we've got Walter Cronkite saying they're setting up world government.
[00:58:24.915 --> 00:58:27.817]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, back in 70 seconds for the fourth hour.

[00:59:59.468 --> 00:59:59.549]  Yeah.
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:10.221]  Okay, Bob Dacey, our guest in studio.
[01:00:10.241 --> 01:00:17.385]  Bob, you've got a lot of notes and comments and news articles you want to go over concerning the bailout that, at least for this round, failed today in the House.
[01:00:18.005 --> 01:00:22.567]  A big shocker, but the polls show around five to nine percent, depending on which poll.
[01:00:23.208 --> 01:00:27.050]  And we've got a bunch of them up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:00:27.070 --> 01:00:29.051]  Also, hundreds of top economists
[01:00:29.631 --> 01:00:38.594]  Have written emails, letters, they've gone on TV, they've gone on radio, they've said it's a big scam, they've said that these are criminal acts committed by those in the banking structure.
[01:00:38.634 --> 01:00:43.776]  We played some congressmen and women commenting on this during the debates earlier in the first hour.
[01:00:44.156 --> 01:00:50.878]  I had a congressman on from Texas who said they basically declared martial law in the House, saying the normal rules were suspended.
[01:00:51.298 --> 01:00:54.759]  I mean, these are some crazy times that we're in the middle of right now.
[01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:56.280]  Bob Dacey, continue.
[01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:59.583]  I think that what they were trying to do, Alex, was just too over the top.
[01:00:59.663 --> 01:01:11.333]  I mean, I looked at the so-called improved bill, the 110 pages of garbage that they posted last night on the internet, and they had basically four things they promised us idiots that they were going to do.
[01:01:12.114 --> 01:01:15.777]  One of them was to make sure that the executives didn't get paid too much.
[01:01:16.018 --> 01:01:19.401]  You know what kind of a nonsense that is relative to the amount of money they were talking about?
[01:01:19.681 --> 01:01:25.866]  You're talking about a few million here or there instead of billions and billions and billions with the shareholders.
[01:01:25.906 --> 01:01:37.357]  But the larger issue is they said, don't worry, an independent commission made up of Paulson and the chairman of the Federal Reserve and the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the guys that literally did the bank robbery.
[01:01:37.717 --> 01:01:38.797]  They will oversee it.
[01:01:39.017 --> 01:01:48.701]  Yeah, you're going to have Paulson, and you're going to have Bernanke, and you're going to have a couple of other executive branch people are going to oversee it.
[01:01:48.741 --> 01:01:50.061]  And again, what is that like?
[01:01:50.081 --> 01:01:51.702]  The authors of the bill will oversee it.
[01:01:51.722 --> 01:01:59.465]  That's like installing a group of foxes to determine what it is, why the chickens are missing from the hen house.
[01:01:59.485 --> 01:02:02.526]  We're going to figure this out for you guys, and that's going to be good.
[01:02:03.226 --> 01:02:08.468]  And they also said they were going to, again with this limiting executive compensation, that was nonsense.
[01:02:09.008 --> 01:02:13.529]  Well that's because the public has been taught to obsess on CEOs making 50 million a piece.
[01:02:13.549 --> 01:02:13.989]  That's nonsense!
[01:02:14.029 --> 01:02:15.730]  And we're talking about trillions of dollars here.
[01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:24.973]  Yeah, and they also said that they were going to make sure that in several years from now, if the enterprises that they're going to buy for way more than they're worth,
[01:02:25.413 --> 01:02:29.574]  Start making money that they're going to have to like, no, they didn't say they were going to have to pay it back.
[01:02:29.895 --> 01:02:34.516]  They said the president was going to have to make a proposal that they pay it back.
[01:02:34.736 --> 01:02:37.877]  So I mean, when you ask the girl to marry her, that's a proposal.
[01:02:37.917 --> 01:02:39.498]  She doesn't have to say yes, does she?
[01:02:39.778 --> 01:02:40.438]  It's a crock!
[01:02:40.638 --> 01:02:42.999]  No, they said maybe later.
[01:02:43.899 --> 01:02:45.619]  And here's the math of the deal.
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:49.180]  You've got a $100,000 mortgage on a house, right?
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:52.641]  The thing is now, the house that holds it up is only worth $60,000 now.
[01:02:52.661 --> 01:02:54.962]  Because like in California, they said that real estate has dropped 40%.
[01:02:55.002 --> 01:02:56.362]  So you've got a $100,000 mortgage with a $60,000 house.
[01:03:00.223 --> 01:03:08.371]  Bernanke said that the point of all this was to take the $700 billion and buy these things for more like what their normal market value would be, i.e.
[01:03:08.391 --> 01:03:08.371]  $100,000.
[01:03:08.551 --> 01:03:15.217]  So if you buy something that's worth $60,000, how in the world are you going to make any money on it in a few years so you can pay us back?
[01:03:15.337 --> 01:03:20.542]  It is a total crock, and I think even the Congress people were able to figure that out.
[01:03:21.172 --> 01:03:23.453]  Well, I think they know, getting millions of phone calls.
[01:03:23.493 --> 01:03:34.480]  I mean, per congressman, they said it was thousands and thousands, and they said, out of congressmen on First Hour, saying, out of several thousand phone calls against, five, count it, five were for it.
[01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:35.700]  For the bailout.
[01:03:35.901 --> 01:03:37.902]  Yeah, those were probably the guys that are members of the Federal Reserve Board.
[01:03:37.922 --> 01:03:41.524]  But that's kind of like TxDOT handing over our roads to the private company, Centra.
[01:03:41.904 --> 01:03:50.449]  They'll have a meeting with 1,200 people, and there'll be three or four there for it, and they're all TxDOT employees, and then they say, okay, we're voting against what the people want, we're going to hand it over to Centra.
[01:03:50.629 --> 01:03:55.854]  And I've got a story on that I'm working on right now, Alex, too, about the Stafford Superhighway.
[01:03:55.974 --> 01:03:56.895]  Big, big story.
[01:03:57.276 --> 01:03:57.836]  Huge one.
[01:03:58.257 --> 01:03:59.198]  Are you interested in it?
[01:03:59.658 --> 01:04:00.379]  It's a big sucker.
[01:04:00.419 --> 01:04:01.260]  I wouldn't wait on it, though.
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:02.581]  I'd go ahead and get the story out.
[01:04:02.621 --> 01:04:06.565]  Well, basically, this is something that I think you need to handle because you're the big cheese, okay?
[01:04:06.585 --> 01:04:08.387]  You know, you are the imperious leader and all that.
[01:04:08.707 --> 01:04:09.388]  Oh yeah, right.
[01:04:09.728 --> 01:04:18.958]  You know, we've been working on the Trans-Texas Corridor for a long time, and our typical TV shows had a lot to do with it, and our work in The New American has had a lot to do with stopping the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[01:04:19.139 --> 01:04:21.982]  Pasture came out a few months ago and said it was dead, which it really is.
[01:04:22.002 --> 01:04:22.602]  Yeah, sure it's dead.
[01:04:22.622 --> 01:04:23.543]  That's possum behavior.
[01:04:24.324 --> 01:04:29.927]  But there's a new deal coming out in Arizona which is obscene and it's huge.
[01:04:30.347 --> 01:04:40.133]  They're trying to kick 450 people out of their houses because their houses are in the way of a hub they want to build and the Canamex route going through Arizona.
[01:04:40.173 --> 01:04:41.053]  Which doesn't exist.
[01:04:41.113 --> 01:04:42.814]  It's in all the official documents but it doesn't exist.
[01:04:42.834 --> 01:04:43.655]  Well, it exists.
[01:04:43.755 --> 01:04:44.135]  No, no.
[01:04:44.155 --> 01:04:45.616]  The sky doesn't exist.
[01:04:45.696 --> 01:04:46.897]  The bailout doesn't exist.
[01:04:47.537 --> 01:04:48.358]  The government's good.
[01:04:48.398 --> 01:04:48.878]  Don't lie.
[01:04:51.573 --> 01:04:54.375]  I know I'm on air, but I'm just gonna go ahead and do it.
[01:05:10.302 --> 01:05:13.643]  Because somebody's lunch here at my office with a guy running my board.
[01:05:13.683 --> 01:05:16.204]  He's at lunch and he's not back.
[01:05:16.684 --> 01:05:18.625]  Did John Harmon ever come back from his meeting?
[01:05:18.965 --> 01:05:19.745]  Yep, I'm back now.
[01:05:19.765 --> 01:05:20.806]  Oh, your lordship!
[01:05:20.946 --> 01:05:21.926]  I am back, Jones.
[01:05:22.266 --> 01:05:25.947]  We may skip a few breaks for folks that are watching, so get ready for that in the next segment.
[01:05:26.207 --> 01:05:26.748]  Okay, you got it.
[01:05:28.068 --> 01:05:29.669]  They must be getting a lot of calls at Midas.
[01:05:29.689 --> 01:05:32.349]  I tried to call you on the back line and all circuits were busy twice.
[01:05:34.290 --> 01:05:35.491]  You're calling 125 and it was busy?
[01:05:38.547 --> 01:05:39.328]  Well, remember, we're on air.
[01:05:39.348 --> 01:05:44.351]  Let's... Okay, well, I'll... No, I mean, not now.
[01:05:44.531 --> 01:05:47.953]  Maybe not now, but... Anyways, how are you doing today?
[01:05:48.293 --> 01:05:48.934]  I'm doing good.
[01:05:50.115 --> 01:05:53.177]  What would you like to say on air to the folks watching and listening?
[01:05:53.797 --> 01:05:54.778]  God bless you all.
[01:05:55.558 --> 01:05:56.559]  You make this show possible.
[01:05:56.679 --> 01:05:57.900]  God bless you all.
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:00.241]  What does Tiny Tim say at the end of the Christmas story?
[01:06:00.701 --> 01:06:02.042]  God bless you everyone.
[01:06:04.053 --> 01:06:04.673]  Every one of us.
[01:06:04.973 --> 01:06:07.014]  But that doesn't exist.
[01:06:07.034 --> 01:06:08.015]  Christmas doesn't exist.
[01:06:08.715 --> 01:06:09.656]  You're making it up.
[01:06:09.756 --> 01:06:13.837]  If you see a bird hopping around in a tree, it doesn't exist.
[01:06:13.897 --> 01:06:15.738]  Nothing exists but what the government says, John.
[01:06:16.299 --> 01:06:16.519]  Yes.
[01:06:16.659 --> 01:06:18.820]  If the government tells you you don't exist, you don't exist.
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:20.140]  I don't.
[01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:23.222]  And if I tell you 2 plus 2 equals 97, it does.
[01:06:23.322 --> 01:06:24.642]  Or you're with Al-Qaeda, boy.
[01:06:24.882 --> 01:06:25.403]  That's right.
[01:06:26.723 --> 01:06:27.944]  Thank you, John, for talking to us.
[01:06:27.964 --> 01:06:34.186]  Hey, Bob Dacey, doesn't it seem to you, though, like no matter what crap the government puts out and the corporations now, no one's buying it?
[01:06:34.466 --> 01:06:37.867]  I mean, we've done quite a bit of good waking people up.
[01:06:37.967 --> 01:06:47.431]  Is it possible that people like Alex Jones, working 18 hours and 20 hours a day for all these years, for all this time, have actually started to have an effect?
[01:06:47.991 --> 01:06:52.073]  Is it possible that we're pushing back against these people and they're getting a little nervous?
[01:06:52.393 --> 01:06:54.974]  Is it possible that we are actually winning this thing?
[01:06:55.234 --> 01:06:59.196]  Is it possible that someday we'll be able to arrest them and try them?
[01:06:59.476 --> 01:07:02.438]  They're going to get full due process.
[01:07:02.458 --> 01:07:03.018]  Absolutely.
[01:07:03.058 --> 01:07:04.119]  Full due process.
[01:07:04.819 --> 01:07:06.940]  They're going to get... But what is a jury of their peers?
[01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:07.461]  What is that?
[01:07:07.501 --> 01:07:09.221]  Is it like other CFR members or what?
[01:07:09.241 --> 01:07:12.243]  I have a hard time picturing what their definition is.
[01:07:12.363 --> 01:07:14.964]  A jury of their peers just means randomly selected from the community.
[01:07:15.205 --> 01:07:18.566]  Okay, well I don't think that's their definition of peers because they think they don't have any.
[01:07:19.367 --> 01:07:19.527]  Right?
[01:07:21.128 --> 01:07:22.829]  Did you have a nice lunch?
[01:07:23.942 --> 01:07:25.243]  Mr. Lunchey's back.
[01:07:25.263 --> 01:07:27.605]  Actually, no, I didn't have lunch.
[01:07:27.645 --> 01:07:29.446]  No, no, I'm talking to the other culprit down here.
[01:07:29.466 --> 01:07:30.006]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:07:31.447 --> 01:07:32.368]  I'm just joking around.
[01:07:32.408 --> 01:07:32.808]  You know what?
[01:07:32.888 --> 01:07:37.211]  I'm glad this bailout didn't pass, but now they're going to destroy the economy and say it was all our fault.
[01:07:37.431 --> 01:07:39.132]  They're masters at psychology.
[01:07:39.172 --> 01:07:40.493]  Now, I believe they lost control here.
[01:07:40.833 --> 01:07:42.014]  I believe they were trying to pass it.
[01:07:42.134 --> 01:07:43.175]  I'm going to say that when we get back.
[01:07:43.395 --> 01:07:45.657]  We're going live to the full audience right now.
[01:07:46.017 --> 01:07:50.340]  PrisonPlanet.tv viewers get to see all the silliness that goes on, but here we go.
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:56.282]  Alright, I'm in a good mood right now.
[01:07:56.302 --> 01:07:56.762]  I'm giddy.
[01:08:17.133 --> 01:08:19.935]  Because clearly this is not staged.
[01:08:20.375 --> 01:08:21.856]  My instincts, my gut.
[01:08:22.176 --> 01:08:23.036]  What is your instinct?
[01:08:23.076 --> 01:08:23.757]  What is your gut?
[01:08:23.837 --> 01:08:28.179]  It's hundreds of points, facts, research, history, body language.
[01:08:28.519 --> 01:08:34.202]  It's like asking a good police detective, well why is it your hunch he committed the murder and nine times out of ten it turns out they were right.
[01:08:34.843 --> 01:08:35.803]  It's not really a hunch.
[01:08:35.843 --> 01:08:41.306]  A hunch is a word for, I don't have ten hours to go through all the evidence of why I know Billy Bob did it.
[01:08:42.507 --> 01:08:45.549]  And then later you go, you know, look at the evidence that Billy Bob did.
[01:08:46.873 --> 01:08:54.255]  I don't know for a fact that this isn't staged with the failure of the bailout passage a few hours ago.
[01:08:55.075 --> 01:09:00.457]  I don't know that that was not staged, but I know that every member of the House is not controlled.
[01:09:00.497 --> 01:09:01.637]  It's the committee chairmen that are.
[01:09:02.377 --> 01:09:12.380]  I know that I've interviewed a congressman on air, several others I've seen giving interviews, have been saying, and the polls show, around five to nine percent, any way you cut it,
[01:09:13.601 --> 01:09:16.905]  90 plus percent are against this bailout package.
[01:09:18.846 --> 01:09:21.367]  And just masses of calls.
[01:09:21.947 --> 01:09:26.208]  Thousands and thousands and thousands of calls and letters and emails in the last week and a half to Congress.
[01:09:26.948 --> 01:09:29.548]  The fiscal year is about to end tomorrow.
[01:09:29.568 --> 01:09:33.089]  I don't think they're going to get the bailout plan.
[01:09:33.289 --> 01:09:34.629]  Big defeat with it failing.
[01:09:34.969 --> 01:09:36.950]  Will they be able to repackage it and bring it back?
[01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:38.390]  Bob Dacey's been reading over it.
[01:09:38.750 --> 01:09:39.670]  We've been reading over it.
[01:09:39.710 --> 01:09:42.411]  Strangely enough, it won't let us print it on two different computers.
[01:09:43.331 --> 01:09:46.552]  So it's not even letting us copy it and put it in documents and print it.
[01:09:46.852 --> 01:09:50.333]  So somebody put systems on there to keep you from printing it.
[01:09:51.213 --> 01:09:52.874]  It's got all the same crap in there.
[01:09:52.934 --> 01:09:55.494]  The immunity and the rest of it is in there.
[01:09:55.534 --> 01:09:56.394]  We've confirmed that.
[01:09:57.675 --> 01:09:59.335]  And so what's going to happen now?
[01:09:59.935 --> 01:10:02.676]  We probably should analyze that and then go back and look at the last bailout.
[01:10:03.696 --> 01:10:07.377]  They're going to plunge the stock market and it's down almost 600 points right now.
[01:10:07.878 --> 01:10:08.418]  Gold is
[01:10:10.231 --> 01:10:14.594]  Up $30, a cool $30 right now.
[01:10:14.614 --> 01:10:15.995]  It's a few cents short of $30.
[01:10:16.336 --> 01:10:17.016]  I'm refreshing.
[01:10:20.238 --> 01:10:22.140]  And so a lot of things are happening.
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:22.780]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:24.321]  Gold is up $33.10.
[01:10:24.902 --> 01:10:30.306]  It's gone up $3.20 in the last 20 minutes.
[01:10:31.667 --> 01:10:33.268]  So it's going straight to the moon.
[01:10:34.589 --> 01:10:36.210]  So much is happening on that front.
[01:10:37.867 --> 01:10:47.034]  So we should talk about, and we're opening the phones up in about ten minutes, we should talk about what Bob Dacey today, who really has been studying and writes articles for New American Magazine and hosts this TV show for nigh on, is it a decade yet?
[01:10:47.254 --> 01:10:48.555]  Nine years.
[01:10:48.615 --> 01:10:49.035]  Nine years.
[01:10:49.055 --> 01:10:51.037]  We just finished our ninth year, I can't believe it.
[01:10:52.236 --> 01:10:56.880]  So, bottom line, this is being devalued, but not as fast as the bankers would have liked.
[01:10:57.020 --> 01:10:59.342]  If this bailout would have passed, the dollar would have gone down.
[01:10:59.803 --> 01:11:02.885]  Gold probably, the more I think about it, probably would have gone up either way.
[01:11:03.626 --> 01:11:08.050]  Now, look for the dollar to stay the same, though it's dropping.
[01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:13.034]  I would think it would stay the same, saying that, you know, as much damage has been done, it wouldn't drop any more for now.
[01:11:14.196 --> 01:11:20.307]  I would think it would have gone down further if they would have passed this, but gold regardless is why a lot of crazy things are going on.
[01:11:20.768 --> 01:11:22.952]  What is the establishment going to do now?
[01:11:24.315 --> 01:11:36.041]  Because they had the Republican and Democratic leadership in the House and in the Senate, in the Executive with the Republicans, and most of these governors on both parties coming out and saying we had to have it.
[01:11:36.501 --> 01:11:39.482]  Most of the TV coverage said, well the people don't want it but you need it.
[01:11:39.522 --> 01:11:45.185]  And so the news spin over the weekend was, we know the people don't want it, but you don't know what's best for you.
[01:11:45.445 --> 01:11:46.466]  We've got to have something.
[01:11:46.506 --> 01:11:48.707]  It's a bad plan, but it's better than nothing.
[01:11:48.727 --> 01:11:49.727]  We're going to have a depression.
[01:11:50.008 --> 01:11:52.369]  Paulson came out yelling, fire in the theater, he should be
[01:11:53.349 --> 01:12:09.575]  You know, you've got free speech, but as the Secretary of the Treasury, who's committed most of these crimes, and let all this happen, and been involved in it, in conflict of interest, giving tens of billions a week to Goldman Sachs that he just ran a few years ago, he needs to step down, he needs to resign.
[01:12:09.975 --> 01:12:14.717]  Now, I don't think he should be arrested, even though in his power position, he yelled fire in the theater.
[01:12:15.217 --> 01:12:16.998]  I mean, he needs to be shut up.
[01:12:17.518 --> 01:12:23.841]  He needs to be told by the President, shut your mouth, stop saying, we're going to have a depression.
[01:12:24.262 --> 01:12:26.403]  And they've had Bernanke running around saying that.
[01:12:26.683 --> 01:12:30.765]  Because these are the big financial heads, and they're saying, run for the hills if this doesn't pass.
[01:12:31.085 --> 01:12:33.466]  And now, here's the bottom line.
[01:12:33.506 --> 01:12:34.667]  I'm thinking about this as I talk.
[01:12:36.228 --> 01:12:37.028]  Here's the bottom line.
[01:12:38.409 --> 01:12:41.991]  If there is a depression out of this, they already set all this up and let us into this.
[01:12:43.237 --> 01:12:47.638]  They need to get the blame for saying a depression would come if this didn't pass.
[01:12:48.098 --> 01:12:58.241]  If the stock market tanks by a third today, which is shaping up to lose ten percent at least today, it looks like, if that happens, they are the ones that did it.
[01:12:58.301 --> 01:13:08.544]  They caused the previous economic activities and set up the system that's now causing this, and they then grandstanded and said,
[01:13:10.694 --> 01:13:23.069]  Pardons, give us unlimited political power, create a fourth branch of government above all the rest of the government, make the private Federal Reserve governmental, it's always been private basically, give them governmental powers, or Armageddon, fiscal Armageddon.
[01:13:24.344 --> 01:13:26.465]  And so they are behind it all.
[01:13:26.505 --> 01:13:29.386]  They engineered what's happened, and now they're fear-mongering.
[01:13:30.066 --> 01:13:30.927]  I'm concerned, Bob.
[01:13:30.987 --> 01:13:33.087]  I don't know how the market isn't going to completely tank.
[01:13:33.587 --> 01:13:39.190]  And plus, you notice, they're not in there with the Plunge Protection Team, it appears, with the Federal Reserve dumping money into the market to prop it up.
[01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:42.511]  So these bastards are in control, and they're doing it any way you cut it.
[01:13:42.551 --> 01:13:42.971]  Bob Dasey.
[01:13:43.171 --> 01:13:55.117]  Well, you know, one good thing about all this, and people of my ilk have said for years and years and years that the salvation of this country in terms of politically has never been through the executive branch of the government.
[01:13:55.497 --> 01:14:01.160]  The House of Representatives has always been the place that it's kind of like we have to rely on them, unfortunately.
[01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:11.083]  And in this particular case, it looks like massive pressure on the part of the people of the United States has finally gotten the House to pay attention.
[01:14:11.683 --> 01:14:16.625]  And, you know, although I would be a lot more comfortable if they would conduct an investigation
[01:14:17.305 --> 01:14:28.614]  And start indicting some of these people because, you know, Nancy Kaptur herself, Democratic representative, she said yesterday that there's criminal behavior going on here.
[01:14:28.654 --> 01:14:29.495]  Well, hey, let's go!
[01:14:30.155 --> 01:14:35.960]  You know, now that we've stopped the bailout, this dollar's going up in smoke there, Alex, you better be careful.
[01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:40.221]  I'm burning a dollar here in the studio trying to distract me here.
[01:14:40.241 --> 01:14:42.102]  Yeah, I'm afraid it's going to get on me.
[01:14:42.902 --> 01:14:48.303]  But, you know, why don't they start... get a grand jury and... uh oh.
[01:14:50.644 --> 01:14:51.064]  Okay.
[01:14:51.084 --> 01:14:52.204]  Oops, sorry.
[01:14:52.224 --> 01:14:53.245]  Yeah, blow it at me, Alex.
[01:14:54.710 --> 01:14:56.752]  Hang on, we've got a fire here.
[01:14:56.772 --> 01:14:58.313]  We're putting out a fire here in the studio.
[01:14:58.333 --> 01:14:59.874]  That's going to be the value of the dollar.
[01:14:59.894 --> 01:15:06.719]  That's about how much it's going to be left from what it was in 1913, when the private Federal Reserve took over.
[01:15:06.739 --> 01:15:08.540]  We told you these guys would take advantage, everybody.
[01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:13.164]  Hey, if any of you want to believe this, all you've got to do is go on the internet and get one of those inflation calculators.
[01:15:13.764 --> 01:15:15.686]  And type in whatever amount of money you want.
[01:15:15.706 --> 01:15:19.810]  That's already about the value of what it was from that quote, about one and a half percent?
[01:15:19.930 --> 01:15:20.590]  That's about right.
[01:15:20.890 --> 01:15:24.614]  I think if I remember correctly... They claimed three, but that last number was done about two years ago.
[01:15:24.634 --> 01:15:30.219]  Yeah, I think what it took a dollar to buy now, back then it would cost you a couple of pennies.
[01:15:30.239 --> 01:15:30.899]  Here, Bob Shum.
[01:15:31.299 --> 01:15:31.880]  Thank you.
[01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:34.642]  This is your dollar relative to like 1913 or 1911, you know.
[01:15:37.885 --> 01:15:44.927]  When the Jekyll Island meeting took place and they started forming the Federal Reserve, this is what they've done to your dollar over the last several years.
[01:15:45.287 --> 01:15:52.869]  Because literally, I mean, two cents back then... But while it was worth something, they took it and bought up real assets.
[01:15:52.929 --> 01:15:56.670]  And the bottom line is, all this is, it's a giant scam.
[01:15:56.830 --> 01:15:59.651]  It's theft of your hard work, your hard labor.
[01:16:00.211 --> 01:16:02.092]  Through the vehicle of inflation.
[01:16:02.112 --> 01:16:03.132]  You can put that in your wallet.
[01:16:03.592 --> 01:16:05.992]  Yeah, I'll tell you what, I'd give me a Happy Meal with that.
[01:16:06.933 --> 01:16:10.654]  I mean, that's... He's vandalizing the currency.
[01:16:11.094 --> 01:16:11.974]  Shame on you, Alex.
[01:16:12.474 --> 01:16:14.815]  I mean, literally, that's what this is.
[01:16:15.875 --> 01:16:20.776]  They've been confiscating the value of your hard-earned assets for decades through the Federal Reserve System.
[01:16:20.836 --> 01:16:24.857]  It's not hard to understand, but people don't understand money.
[01:16:25.444 --> 01:16:27.505]  They flat do not understand money.
[01:16:28.066 --> 01:16:35.631]  You know, when they pour a bunch of money into a system without a rise of goods and services, then you just dilute the value of the money.
[01:16:35.871 --> 01:16:38.053]  If you don't understand money, do you understand iced tea?
[01:16:38.273 --> 01:16:42.136]  Well, by the way, someday they're going to get completely rid of the currency.
[01:16:42.876 --> 01:16:45.538]  And when that happens, they're going to take the 1.5%
[01:16:47.219 --> 01:16:47.520]  I think so.
[01:17:03.982 --> 01:17:04.663]  Of the value.
[01:17:04.963 --> 01:17:05.143]  Yeah.
[01:17:05.463 --> 01:17:06.444]  Used to be in the good old days.
[01:17:06.484 --> 01:17:10.427]  Well, I guess it's a collection, kind of like old Confederate notes.
[01:17:10.647 --> 01:17:15.912]  If you took a dollar in the 1800s and parked it on the shelf for a year, you could buy the same amount of stuff with it a year later.
[01:17:16.412 --> 01:17:19.515]  Now you come back and your dollar is missing a big chunk.
[01:17:19.735 --> 01:17:20.395]  How'd that happen?
[01:17:20.575 --> 01:17:23.518]  And people are too dumb to figure out that that was an inflation tax.
[01:17:23.898 --> 01:17:25.519]  And that's what they've been doing for all these years.
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:28.662]  And now, like I said, the House of Rent
[01:17:29.162 --> 01:17:32.243]  The House of Representatives just did something I hadn't figured it out yet.
[01:17:32.263 --> 01:17:34.223]  I don't know how this is going to settle out, Alex.
[01:17:34.283 --> 01:17:35.764]  We're celebrating by burning money!
[01:17:36.184 --> 01:17:37.764]  Yeah, you know, we've got money to burn.
[01:17:37.804 --> 01:17:38.404]  You know, why not?
[01:17:38.444 --> 01:17:39.645]  It's going to be worthless.
[01:17:39.925 --> 01:17:42.245]  Actually, that'll be used as toilet paper.
[01:17:42.585 --> 01:17:44.966]  Well, you know, actually I prefer the U.N.
[01:17:45.226 --> 01:17:47.846]  toilet paper roll myself, but that's a whole other subject.
[01:17:48.187 --> 01:17:49.247]  You know, I've actually used that.
[01:17:49.307 --> 01:17:51.127]  I bought a whole thing of it at a gun show.
[01:17:51.207 --> 01:17:52.087]  Well, I got some of that.
[01:17:52.167 --> 01:17:54.308]  When I had family come into town as a joke, it was in the
[01:17:54.528 --> 01:17:56.589]  I got that from Daniel New, and I still have it.
[01:17:56.649 --> 01:18:00.710]  It's in my store, in my showcase there, a little roll of U.N.
[01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:01.110]  toilet paper.
[01:18:01.130 --> 01:18:01.751]  You don't use it?
[01:18:02.471 --> 01:18:03.992]  Well, I like to look at it.
[01:18:04.892 --> 01:18:06.432]  After it's been used?
[01:18:06.512 --> 01:18:07.233]  I don't want to run out.
[01:18:07.273 --> 01:18:09.294]  I want to hoard it.
[01:18:09.614 --> 01:18:10.574]  I want to hoard this stuff.
[01:18:11.234 --> 01:18:12.715]  You're hoarding used toilet paper?
[01:18:12.755 --> 01:18:13.355]  No, U.N.
[01:18:13.395 --> 01:18:15.076]  toilet paper, not used toilet paper.
[01:18:15.256 --> 01:18:15.616]  U.N.
[01:18:16.116 --> 01:18:16.796]  toilet paper.
[01:18:16.836 --> 01:18:17.937]  There's a difference there, Alex.
[01:18:18.797 --> 01:18:19.037]  Yeah.
[01:18:19.618 --> 01:18:24.504]  But anyway, I mean, you know, I think part of the problem is you got this one giant bailout.
[01:18:24.524 --> 01:18:30.111]  I'm not being mean, but it is funny when the illegal aliens, like Walmart and stuff, you notice they don't throw it in the toilet?
[01:18:30.551 --> 01:18:31.292]  They throw it in the corner?
[01:18:34.545 --> 01:18:35.606]  I'm sorry, folks!
[01:18:35.626 --> 01:18:36.427]  That's good.
[01:18:36.467 --> 01:18:39.709]  This show is deteriorating.
[01:18:39.809 --> 01:18:41.911]  I can't handle it anymore!
[01:18:42.131 --> 01:18:43.372]  They're coming to take me away!
[01:18:44.513 --> 01:18:45.994]  Everything is insane.
[01:18:46.054 --> 01:18:48.256]  The House of Representatives did something good for a change.
[01:18:48.296 --> 01:18:49.217]  I mean, what's with that?
[01:18:49.857 --> 01:18:54.280]  You know, I mean, it's like, I have said before that... Because they're probably going to crash the economy and blame it on us.
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:19:00.143]  I don't know, but recently I thought that, you know, we've been fighting this delaying action going back and back and back and back.
[01:19:00.483 --> 01:19:06.766]  And the last couple of years to this NAFTA Superhighway fight that we've been on, I feel like we've been going forward and making them retreat.
[01:19:07.146 --> 01:19:09.188]  And here's another little victory for this.
[01:19:09.328 --> 01:19:11.349]  I don't know whether it's going to be a Pyrrhic victory for us.
[01:19:11.409 --> 01:19:12.789]  Oh, no, Alex is getting some more of his money out.
[01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:14.590]  Hey, Alex, I dare you to burn that $100 bill.
[01:19:15.911 --> 01:19:17.092]  I don't have a hundred dollars.
[01:19:17.112 --> 01:19:17.972]  He's got a twenty.
[01:19:18.112 --> 01:19:18.992]  No, stop that.
[01:19:19.693 --> 01:19:20.113]  Look at that.
[01:19:21.974 --> 01:19:23.354]  He's going to cause a fire in here.
[01:19:24.455 --> 01:19:25.855]  With all the theater lights and everything?
[01:19:25.875 --> 01:19:26.215]  Yeah.
[01:19:29.457 --> 01:19:30.997]  I think Alex is celebrating, y'all.
[01:19:31.017 --> 01:19:31.797]  I think he's happy.
[01:19:32.318 --> 01:19:34.218]  The House of Representatives finally did something smart.
[01:19:34.238 --> 01:19:36.099]  Alright, Bob, let's get serious.
[01:19:36.159 --> 01:19:36.739]  I'll stop it.
[01:19:36.759 --> 01:19:43.502]  We're going to, during this break, for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, we are going to let Bob continue.
[01:19:43.522 --> 01:19:44.723]  We're going to come back and take phone calls.
[01:19:46.343 --> 01:19:47.464]  We're going to continue right now.
[01:19:47.484 --> 01:19:48.745]  Alright, we'll get serious.
[01:19:48.765 --> 01:19:50.547]  Alright, Bob, go ahead.
[01:19:51.988 --> 01:19:53.610]  This is the break part, right?
[01:19:53.770 --> 01:19:54.650]  We're skipping the break.
[01:19:54.670 --> 01:19:55.531]  We're skipping the break.
[01:19:55.571 --> 01:19:56.332]  I didn't hear you say that.
[01:19:57.513 --> 01:19:59.415]  Anyway, can I get back to my other subject?
[01:19:59.455 --> 01:20:01.857]  I wanted to tell you about this huge news story, because this is important.
[01:20:02.426 --> 01:20:03.006]  This is important.
[01:20:03.026 --> 01:20:06.207]  I don't want to talk about the economy, but this is another way they're screwing us out of our property.
[01:20:06.267 --> 01:20:06.867]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:20:07.467 --> 01:20:09.748]  I'll burn money while you do that.
[01:20:09.828 --> 01:20:19.991]  In Arizona, you've got a situation where the Attorney General, under the guise of saving an Air Force base, is kicking people out of a residential area.
[01:20:20.011 --> 01:20:20.611]  That's freedom!
[01:20:20.631 --> 01:20:21.831]  That's what America's about!
[01:20:22.171 --> 01:20:23.651]  What are you with Al-Qaeda, boy?
[01:20:23.852 --> 01:20:26.172]  It's a step up from eminent domain.
[01:20:26.492 --> 01:20:28.773]  With eminent domain, you've got to pay the suckers, see?
[01:20:29.773 --> 01:20:37.320]  But with this procedure, they have just made sure that nobody in the subdivision can get a permit to do anything, therefore the house is worthless.
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:39.802]  And if they have to move, nobody's going to buy it.
[01:20:40.262 --> 01:20:46.388]  And this thing is sitting literally in between... If those people don't move off right now, well, they'll just send a SWAT team in!
[01:20:46.468 --> 01:20:52.433]  Yeah, it's sitting between a Canamex corridor location and a big... Those don't exist!
[01:20:52.513 --> 01:20:53.755]  ...a multimodal hub
[01:20:54.375 --> 01:20:57.176]  That's supposed to be on the other side of it, and they're kind of in the way.
[01:20:57.436 --> 01:21:04.097]  And what's interesting is that the Attorney General of the state, who wants to run for governor, has imposed this building moratorium, this permit.
[01:21:04.117 --> 01:21:06.178]  You can't get a permit to do anything in this area.
[01:21:06.378 --> 01:21:07.338]  That's how you do it!
[01:21:07.498 --> 01:21:08.779]  But... That's America!
[01:21:08.799 --> 01:21:10.879]  If it's a commercial development, guess what?
[01:21:11.279 --> 01:21:12.940]  The permitting process goes on.
[01:21:13.260 --> 01:21:14.360]  It's just the residential.
[01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:20.962]  So obviously this residence is in the way of this multimodal hub linking up to the Kanemex corridor.
[01:21:20.982 --> 01:21:21.662]  It doesn't exist.
[01:21:22.262 --> 01:21:24.863]  And the guy who... CNN says the Trans-Texas Corridor doesn't exist.
[01:21:25.243 --> 01:21:27.104]  Well, yeah, we've been fixing them real good.
[01:21:27.264 --> 01:21:28.384]  We got them pretty good.
[01:21:28.424 --> 01:21:29.344]  You're insane.
[01:21:29.404 --> 01:21:30.265]  Yeah, I'm insane.
[01:21:30.425 --> 01:21:31.085]  It doesn't exist.
[01:21:31.145 --> 01:21:34.186]  Yeah, go read one of my stories on the New American Highway robbery or something like that.
[01:21:34.206 --> 01:21:34.566]  Doesn't exist.
[01:21:34.626 --> 01:21:35.326]  Doesn't exist.
[01:21:35.526 --> 01:21:36.227]  Yeah, it doesn't exist.
[01:21:36.247 --> 01:21:36.987]  Doesn't exist.
[01:21:37.027 --> 01:21:37.367]  Doesn't exist.
[01:21:37.387 --> 01:21:39.868]  Yeah, just talk to... None of it exists.
[01:21:39.908 --> 01:21:40.468]  Everything's fine.
[01:21:40.488 --> 01:21:43.729]  The Nation magazine will tell you that we're all a bunch of nuts.
[01:21:44.209 --> 01:21:46.010]  The Nation magazine will tell you we're all crazy.
[01:21:46.846 --> 01:21:47.106]  Yeah.
[01:21:47.647 --> 01:21:54.450]  But anyway, this story is something else because it's a human interest thing where they're kicking people off their property without even having to pay for it.
[01:21:54.470 --> 01:21:56.612]  They're kicking Al-Qaeda off, boy!
[01:21:56.872 --> 01:21:57.752]  White Al-Qaeda.
[01:21:58.233 --> 01:21:58.953]  White Al-Qaeda.
[01:21:58.993 --> 01:22:03.456]  There's secret Al-Qaeda teams everywhere, so we're going to take all your rights!
[01:22:03.996 --> 01:22:09.398]  Take all the money, because I'm Officer Jack Boone, and I'm going to deal with it for you.
[01:22:09.418 --> 01:22:12.859]  Well, in this case, it's in Maricopa County.
[01:22:12.919 --> 01:22:15.320]  I don't know what Arpaio's doing there.
[01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:17.240]  Oh, that's a great American, right there.
[01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:18.061]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:22:18.101 --> 01:22:20.261]  But anyway, it's going to be interesting to see what happens there.
[01:22:20.502 --> 01:22:24.023]  And the problem is that it's a long-term deal.
[01:22:24.483 --> 01:22:26.384]  The military says they don't need the land.
[01:22:26.544 --> 01:22:28.304]  In fact, I'm Sheriff Arpaio.
[01:22:28.324 --> 01:22:30.405]  Give me your wallet right now, or you're with Al Qaeda.
[01:22:30.585 --> 01:22:31.745]  Pink underwear for you, buddy.
[01:22:31.825 --> 01:22:32.646]  Give me the wallet!
[01:22:32.686 --> 01:22:33.346]  Pink underwear.
[01:22:34.987 --> 01:22:35.708]  Pink drawers.
[01:22:35.748 --> 01:22:35.888]  No.
[01:22:35.908 --> 01:22:35.968]  No.
[01:22:35.988 --> 01:22:36.748]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:22:36.768 --> 01:22:37.849]  Yeah, right.
[01:22:37.869 --> 01:22:38.230]  The SWAT team.
[01:22:47.333 --> 01:22:47.613]  What?
[01:22:48.254 --> 01:22:49.054]  The SWAT team?
[01:22:49.074 --> 01:22:49.354]  I don't know.
[01:22:49.754 --> 01:22:50.315]  Look at this guy.
[01:22:50.335 --> 01:22:50.935]  He's going nuts.
[01:22:51.215 --> 01:22:51.676]  I swear.
[01:22:51.696 --> 01:22:53.196]  We're going to get the SWAT team.
[01:22:53.217 --> 01:22:53.837]  That ain't going to happen.
[01:22:53.857 --> 01:22:54.417]  That ain't going to happen.
[01:22:54.437 --> 01:22:55.438]  I'm going to do a joke with it, Bob.
[01:22:55.458 --> 01:22:55.798]  Give it to me.
[01:22:55.998 --> 01:22:56.258]  Okay.
[01:22:56.298 --> 01:22:56.719]  Give you what?
[01:22:56.739 --> 01:22:57.039]  It's a joke.
[01:22:57.079 --> 01:22:57.819]  I might actually run under that.
[01:22:57.839 --> 01:22:58.960]  What am I going to give it to you?
[01:22:58.980 --> 01:22:59.960]  You're afraid I'm going to burn it?
[01:23:00.301 --> 01:23:00.561]  This?
[01:23:00.621 --> 01:23:01.141]  This money?
[01:23:02.222 --> 01:23:03.663]  What do you want me to give to you?
[01:23:03.743 --> 01:23:04.103]  My wallet?
[01:23:06.627 --> 01:23:10.649]  No, I don't have, I'm sorry, I don't have, I don't carry a wallet, I don't have yet, I don't have my papers on me, Alex, I'm sorry.
[01:23:11.169 --> 01:23:12.630]  You do not have your papers?
[01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:14.051]  No, I do not have my papers.
[01:23:14.171 --> 01:23:15.371]  Alright, we're coming back to full audience.
[01:23:15.451 --> 01:23:17.152]  Actually, tell your story in a serious fashion.
[01:23:17.172 --> 01:23:18.393]  Okay.
[01:23:18.513 --> 01:23:20.974]  In a serious fashion, this is... Hold on, we're coming back in just a minute.
[01:23:20.994 --> 01:23:21.774]  First, give me your wallet.
[01:23:22.315 --> 01:23:22.495]  No.
[01:23:23.115 --> 01:23:23.535]  Forget that.
[01:23:23.915 --> 01:23:25.996]  I'll keep my assets to myself.
[01:23:26.417 --> 01:23:28.938]  But I'm gonna send a SWAT team, anti-government!
[01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:34.402]  Okay, so when are we going to be back on the normal audience right now so I can be serious about this?
[01:23:34.422 --> 01:23:37.504]  This is the insane asylum alternate dimension.
[01:23:38.204 --> 01:23:40.946]  Yeah, well, this is important stuff.
[01:23:41.126 --> 01:23:42.046]  Alright, alright, alright.
[01:23:42.106 --> 01:23:43.347]  I'm going to be serious right now.
[01:23:44.007 --> 01:23:45.188]  In fact, I'm going to give you the floor.
[01:23:45.208 --> 01:23:48.550]  I just want everybody to know he's an extremist.
[01:23:49.930 --> 01:23:53.092]  Al Qaeda wants to attack you, don't listen to him!
[01:23:53.892 --> 01:23:55.473]  Go ahead, we're back live.
[01:23:55.753 --> 01:23:56.874]  So here's what you have, basically.
[01:23:59.963 --> 01:24:01.404]  Alright Bob, I'm going to quit screwing around.
[01:24:01.505 --> 01:24:04.868]  Once I start into comics, I actually like to screw around and be funny.
[01:24:05.689 --> 01:24:06.870]  Once I start, it's hard to quit.
[01:24:06.890 --> 01:24:07.931]  That's why I don't do it very often.
[01:24:08.792 --> 01:24:10.374]  Officer Jack Boot has now left the building.
[01:24:11.274 --> 01:24:12.015]  He's very handsome.
[01:24:12.035 --> 01:24:12.776]  He looks just like me.
[01:24:12.796 --> 01:24:14.438]  Except he has a face like this.
[01:24:16.854 --> 01:24:19.835]  He feels very entitled, but I'm going to stop it.
[01:24:19.855 --> 01:24:21.256]  Tell me about the Canamax Highway thing.
[01:24:21.276 --> 01:24:21.756]  That's big.
[01:24:22.036 --> 01:24:23.377]  They've got their Kansas City hub.
[01:24:23.397 --> 01:24:26.578]  They're trying to take over Texas, but they're also setting some stuff up in Arizona.
[01:24:26.658 --> 01:24:27.158]  Tell us about it.
[01:24:27.839 --> 01:24:31.820]  The Napa Superhighway is not just Trans-Texas Corridor 35 going through Texas.
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:34.521]  It's a series of about 80 highways going all over the place.
[01:24:34.962 --> 01:24:37.823]  And this particular one is running near Whitman, Arizona.
[01:24:38.383 --> 01:24:41.886]  And there's a former radio talk show host out there by the name of Dave Hodges.
[01:24:42.166 --> 01:24:43.186]  I don't know if you know who he is.
[01:24:43.206 --> 01:24:44.427]  They ought to arrest him!
[01:24:44.908 --> 01:24:47.229]  Well, I was on his show about a year ago.
[01:24:47.249 --> 01:24:49.771]  He's talking about imaginary North American Union!
[01:24:49.911 --> 01:24:50.772]  That's illegal!
[01:24:50.792 --> 01:24:55.095]  Hey, what do you think of the Obama truth squads out having cops arrest people that disagree with Obama?
[01:24:55.135 --> 01:24:56.956]  That is the definition of insanity.
[01:24:57.056 --> 01:24:59.498]  No, that's the definition of freedom, boy!
[01:25:00.238 --> 01:25:02.039]  I'll say whatever I want to about Obama.
[01:25:02.079 --> 01:25:03.620]  I'll say whatever I want to about McCain.
[01:25:03.660 --> 01:25:06.762]  And if you don't like it, I'm going to have you arrested right now!
[01:25:06.862 --> 01:25:10.684]  And speaking of McCain, McCain is the guy behind this stuff in Arizona.
[01:25:10.744 --> 01:25:12.805]  That's the interesting part about this.
[01:25:13.105 --> 01:25:13.926]  Now we will get serious.
[01:25:13.946 --> 01:25:14.967]  Tell us about it.
[01:25:15.047 --> 01:25:18.769]  Alright, so you've got these people that are living in this area, which has been permitted.
[01:25:19.469 --> 01:25:23.674]  The Attorney General of the State of Arizona has said, sorry guys, no more permits for you.
[01:25:23.694 --> 01:25:24.675]  That'll force them off their land.
[01:25:24.695 --> 01:25:36.528]  Remember in Austin several years ago, out west of here, they said, okay, no more development, we've got to protect the... And then they let her take the restriction off ahead of themselves as arch criminals, and the mindless yuppies dance around loving being conned.
[01:25:36.788 --> 01:25:41.353]  They drove down the price of everybody's stuff out there, and then they get a bond for us to buy it.
[01:25:41.493 --> 01:25:43.975]  And the farmers wouldn't give their land up, they sent SWAT teams.
[01:25:44.215 --> 01:25:49.719]  And then after the price was down, they bought it, and then all of a sudden, a few years later, all these rich developments are popping up out there.
[01:25:49.759 --> 01:25:49.999]  Of course!
[01:25:50.019 --> 01:25:54.583]  Well, that same idea out here, except for these guys are in the way of the Canamex Corridor development.
[01:25:55.203 --> 01:26:09.414]  And it's a real interesting story, and I think that, you know, the human interest part of it is like, okay, how would you like it if you had a house, and you had a fire, and you couldn't get a permit to rebuild your kitchen?
[01:26:10.037 --> 01:26:10.717]  I mean, what are you going to do?
[01:26:11.017 --> 01:26:14.678]  Or if you've got to move, you own a house, you want to move, and nobody's going to buy your house.
[01:26:14.698 --> 01:26:17.759]  So it's just like New London, Connecticut, they're forcing them out.
[01:26:18.039 --> 01:26:20.980]  But it's better than New London, Connecticut for the New World Order crowd.
[01:26:21.220 --> 01:26:22.300]  Oh, it's more abusive!
[01:26:22.401 --> 01:26:23.121]  Oh, good!
[01:26:23.161 --> 01:26:25.801]  Because they don't even have to do the eminent domain.
[01:26:26.002 --> 01:26:26.382]  Excellent!
[01:26:26.402 --> 01:26:30.723]  Because they have a longer period of time before they build this thing, they're just going to force them out by attrition.
[01:26:31.103 --> 01:26:33.564]  They don't even have to pay them, they're going to kick them out by attrition.
[01:26:33.584 --> 01:26:34.304]  But that's freedom!
[01:26:34.986 --> 01:26:36.568]  Yeah, that's freedom for the New World Order.
[01:26:36.588 --> 01:26:39.891]  The American people laughed and giggled about dead Iraqi children, now they can be slaves.
[01:26:39.991 --> 01:26:54.506]  And the same thing they're doing in Texas, they're doing over there, they're couching it with all the local politicos as some sort of a economic development thing, and you peonic homeowners are in the way, and they try to make it a local issue, when they know full well it's not.
[01:26:54.826 --> 01:26:57.429]  And John McCain is the one that was behind all this.
[01:26:57.689 --> 01:26:58.249]  No!
[01:26:58.690 --> 01:26:59.370]  That's right.
[01:26:59.410 --> 01:27:05.212]  His people were at the meetings trying to make sure that this stuff was going through.
[01:27:05.252 --> 01:27:12.295]  He had a peculiar interest in making sure that these deed exceptions were gotten rid of.
[01:27:12.355 --> 01:27:14.216]  So these people are in big trouble.
[01:27:14.376 --> 01:27:16.877]  And there's four areas in the state that they're doing this.
[01:27:16.937 --> 01:27:17.418]  Not just one.
[01:27:17.778 --> 01:27:18.398]  Four areas.
[01:27:18.978 --> 01:27:22.762]  And when we get a story up on that, I want to send it to you because it's huge.
[01:27:22.962 --> 01:27:23.523]  It is huge.
[01:27:23.803 --> 01:27:26.906]  Because this Trans-Texas Corridor thing we've been going through, that's just Texas.
[01:27:27.206 --> 01:27:28.287]  You know, that's the main trunk.
[01:27:28.488 --> 01:27:31.450]  But they've got the Can-Mix Corridor, they've got the Entrada.
[01:27:31.490 --> 01:27:32.291]  There's 83 of these.
[01:27:32.932 --> 01:27:39.298]  And by the way, when states started blocking it, Bush has signed an executive order to start grabbing people's land and grabbing the roads.
[01:27:39.458 --> 01:27:42.721]  Yeah, and of course our local governor here in the state, you know,
[01:27:43.542 --> 01:27:44.383]  Totally trashed.
[01:27:44.563 --> 01:27:45.224]  Twinkle toes?
[01:27:45.424 --> 01:27:51.349]  House Bill 2006, which prohibited these imminent domain proceedings where they force you off your land.
[01:27:51.369 --> 01:27:56.493]  Yeah, but when he does a press conference, he puts on a fake Texas accent and goes, ugh, yeah.
[01:27:56.533 --> 01:27:57.354]  Don't people like it?
[01:27:57.674 --> 01:27:59.876]  Don't be hard on him, Alex.
[01:27:59.996 --> 01:28:01.077]  His mansion burned down.
[01:28:01.117 --> 01:28:02.818]  He's living in a shack somewhere.
[01:28:02.858 --> 01:28:06.081]  Oh, by the way, I was supposed to call Texas Monthly again this morning.
[01:28:06.101 --> 01:28:06.982]  They want to interview me.
[01:28:07.722 --> 01:28:09.044]  What is going on around here?
[01:28:09.064 --> 01:28:11.386]  I just forget everything, and I'm supposed to call
[01:28:12.659 --> 01:28:15.662]  We're going to talk about that after I burn some more Federal Reserve notes.
[01:28:16.642 --> 01:28:19.425]  Why don't you just go buy some stuff with them now instead of later?
[01:28:19.465 --> 01:28:21.307]  Because they're worth more now than they will be tomorrow.
[01:28:21.347 --> 01:28:22.047]  That's my whole point.
[01:28:22.267 --> 01:28:23.468]  Is that the new order?
[01:28:23.488 --> 01:28:24.469]  Well, yeah, but don't burn them.
[01:28:24.529 --> 01:28:26.851]  Just go buy toilet paper with them.
[01:28:26.931 --> 01:28:28.172]  United Nations or the United States?
[01:28:28.192 --> 01:28:29.393]  United Nations toilet paper.
[01:28:29.434 --> 01:28:30.094]  It's on sale.
[01:28:30.134 --> 01:28:30.755]  You ought to get some.
[01:28:31.417 --> 01:28:32.338]  Yeah, it works.
[01:28:33.179 --> 01:28:34.701]  But the UN doesn't exist, Bob.
[01:28:34.941 --> 01:28:35.521]  Yeah, right.
[01:28:36.182 --> 01:28:36.723]  Yeah, right.
[01:28:37.203 --> 01:28:40.747]  Well, I have people telling me that the European Union doesn't exist, and they're serious.
[01:28:41.268 --> 01:28:43.770]  Did you know it's still called a conspiracy theory to say that exists?
[01:28:45.051 --> 01:28:50.573]  Well, look, you know as well as I do that 70% of the population of the United States is a bunch of idiots.
[01:28:50.693 --> 01:28:51.173]  You know that.
[01:28:51.453 --> 01:28:52.334]  And you'll never wake them up.
[01:28:52.794 --> 01:28:54.334]  Because all they care about is them cowboys.
[01:28:54.494 --> 01:28:55.435]  How about them cowboys?
[01:28:55.455 --> 01:28:56.395]  What's about them cowboys?
[01:28:56.415 --> 01:28:57.696]  They lost yesterday.
[01:28:57.716 --> 01:28:59.896]  To heck with all this economy stuff.
[01:29:00.056 --> 01:29:02.577]  The cowboys lost to the redskins of all places.
[01:29:02.857 --> 01:29:04.558]  However, you know what happened else that was good?
[01:29:04.878 --> 01:29:06.239]  The eagles lost, too.
[01:29:06.599 --> 01:29:07.339]  Hold on!
[01:29:07.699 --> 01:29:10.900]  You mean the cowboys lost to the redskins?
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:12.741]  Get a rope, Junior!
[01:29:13.041 --> 01:29:15.622]  The eagle's lost, though, so all is not lost.
[01:29:15.782 --> 01:29:18.282]  I'm just glad I got your W, bro.
[01:29:19.102 --> 01:29:21.163]  I like the way things are runnin'.
[01:29:21.183 --> 01:29:30.345]  Anyways, I had a caller yesterday, said that he wanted to come down to the studio and arrest Webster Tarpley, because he was criticizing, uh, Lord Obama.
[01:29:30.525 --> 01:29:31.425]  He doesn't get it, does he?
[01:29:31.445 --> 01:29:33.386]  Alright, I'm gonna start taking phone calls.
[01:29:33.426 --> 01:29:35.746]  This is descended into total insanity.
[01:29:36.267 --> 01:29:37.627]  Bob is the one acting crazy.
[01:29:42.570 --> 01:29:43.571]  I love doing hillbillies.
[01:29:43.591 --> 01:29:43.951]  You know why?
[01:29:44.011 --> 01:29:46.372]  Because I'm hillbilly, so I can do it.
[01:29:46.452 --> 01:29:49.454]  You did something years ago on my show, which you ought to bring back.
[01:29:49.494 --> 01:29:50.055]  What's going on?
[01:29:51.075 --> 01:29:51.696]  Yeah, we're still on air.
[01:29:52.656 --> 01:29:55.418]  You had some guy named Professor Anselmo that you did.
[01:29:55.458 --> 01:30:00.221]  You did this little thing for this lord riding along, looking at all the peons.
[01:30:00.541 --> 01:30:02.503]  Look at the pathetic rabble.
[01:30:02.543 --> 01:30:05.485]  Yeah, the rabble.
[01:30:05.805 --> 01:30:07.026]  That was some funny stuff.
[01:30:08.206 --> 01:30:10.248]  You see, this is the hillbilly look.
[01:30:11.178 --> 01:30:12.319]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[01:30:12.459 --> 01:30:13.420]  I have to get the mindset.
[01:30:13.460 --> 01:30:15.121]  It's hard to switch back and forth between characters.
[01:30:16.882 --> 01:30:18.703]  And we don't take all the rights.
[01:30:18.883 --> 01:30:20.744]  Al-Qaeda will get the rights!
[01:30:21.585 --> 01:30:23.186]  You know, we're accountable.
[01:30:24.487 --> 01:30:28.710]  But then, there's also... Let me do the elitist.
[01:30:30.123 --> 01:30:33.606]  Of course we've got to eliminate 90% of the rabble.
[01:30:33.926 --> 01:30:35.767]  Why do you think they poisoned the water?
[01:30:35.787 --> 01:30:37.468]  This is immediately needed.
[01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:41.191]  Yeah, that's the elitist.
[01:30:42.972 --> 01:30:46.575]  And they have the elitist back in the good old days with the horses when all the peasants... No such thing.
[01:30:46.615 --> 01:30:47.836]  There were no kings or queens.
[01:30:48.216 --> 01:30:49.457]  No elites dominated the people.
[01:30:49.477 --> 01:30:50.078]  It doesn't exist.
[01:30:50.678 --> 01:30:53.499]  There's no elite corruption, there's nothing bad going on, Bob.
[01:30:54.219 --> 01:30:54.859]  Everything's fine.
[01:30:54.919 --> 01:30:57.720]  Everything is fine because the Eagles lost, too, okay?
[01:30:58.461 --> 01:30:58.881]  That's good.
[01:30:58.941 --> 01:30:59.621]  The Eagles lost.
[01:30:59.701 --> 01:31:02.362]  That means the Cowboys really didn't lose any ground in their division.
[01:31:02.462 --> 01:31:03.082]  You understand?
[01:31:03.162 --> 01:31:04.563]  Were you watching the game last night?
[01:31:04.583 --> 01:31:05.583]  Do you understand what I'm saying?
[01:31:05.623 --> 01:31:06.543]  Were you watching the game?
[01:31:06.563 --> 01:31:07.744]  Chicago Bears, man.
[01:31:08.384 --> 01:31:08.744]  Come on.
[01:31:09.636 --> 01:31:12.319]  You know, I went to the gym yesterday to lift weights.
[01:31:12.780 --> 01:31:14.722]  Yesterday afternoon was the morning, actually.
[01:31:15.323 --> 01:31:16.384]  And I just watched the men.
[01:31:17.345 --> 01:31:20.349]  And I work out at kind of old folks' gyms.
[01:31:20.449 --> 01:31:22.171]  Well, you're getting older now.
[01:31:22.431 --> 01:31:24.834]  No, I don't work out at a meat market.
[01:31:24.854 --> 01:31:26.076]  I just don't like the distractions.
[01:31:26.536 --> 01:31:28.398]  You know, it's just too many guys walking around going...
[01:31:30.477 --> 01:31:33.299]  Boy, just looking for a problem, you know, puffed up.
[01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:35.841]  You like to be the only one doing that and intimidate all the old guys.
[01:31:35.861 --> 01:31:36.462]  Exactly!
[01:31:36.542 --> 01:31:38.243]  No, no, no, now you've got it straight.
[01:31:38.704 --> 01:31:39.444]  No, no, seriously.
[01:31:40.045 --> 01:31:42.707]  I was watching the old guys do it.
[01:31:42.727 --> 01:31:46.530]  Everybody's posing and looking and I'm just trying to ignore it and work out.
[01:31:47.390 --> 01:31:53.675]  But I just thought about these guys all act so tough, everybody's just so into their image and nobody's going to screw them and they're bad ass and all this.
[01:31:54.296 --> 01:31:59.380]  And you know, like men will walk around a corner and you're trying to walk somewhere and then when you try to get out of their way they kind of go...
[01:32:00.566 --> 01:32:02.107]  I mean, it's really freaking weird.
[01:32:02.807 --> 01:32:08.330]  And, you know, as a man, I'm not thinking about that kind of stuff because, you know, back when I was a teenager, I was.
[01:32:09.010 --> 01:32:12.812]  You know, I was into, you know, fist-fighting and being tough, and I thought that was really important.
[01:32:12.852 --> 01:32:15.634]  Later, I figured out it's important not to get into those situations.
[01:32:15.694 --> 01:32:27.680]  But the point I was making is, these men are so into image and acting tough and acting savage and full of, you know, bravado and machismo or, you know, they're macho.
[01:32:29.787 --> 01:32:30.587]  Whatever the word is.
[01:32:30.767 --> 01:32:32.628]  Hey, will you set this with Texas Monthly back up?
[01:32:32.648 --> 01:32:33.408]  Because I keep forgetting.
[01:32:33.448 --> 01:32:33.788]  Thank you.
[01:32:34.109 --> 01:32:36.730]  Anyways, the point is that they cower to cops.
[01:32:36.870 --> 01:32:38.290]  They cower to having their rights violated.
[01:32:38.491 --> 01:32:41.172]  They cower to bankers robbing them and stealing them blind.
[01:32:41.532 --> 01:32:50.456]  I mean, a real man gets really mad about being a slave and his children being slaves and corrupt elites, and then somehow we've been taught... Oh, we're going back live.
[01:32:50.476 --> 01:32:50.836]  Here we go.
[01:32:50.976 --> 01:32:51.977]  We're going live.
[01:32:51.997 --> 01:32:52.257]  Here we go.
[01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:58.732]  Look at your young man fighting.
[01:33:01.209 --> 01:33:07.394]  I was telling the story that we're going to your phone calls, part of Insane Asylum Day here on the radio with Bob Dasey.
[01:33:07.715 --> 01:33:10.137]  He's been really out of control today, Bob, and I don't appreciate it.
[01:33:10.817 --> 01:33:13.039]  You need to learn to settle down on air a little bit.
[01:33:13.059 --> 01:33:15.321]  You know, you're going to be with those yuppies one of these days, boy.
[01:33:15.341 --> 01:33:19.285]  You're going to be on the street corner holding up a sign that says, we'll work for Latte.
[01:33:19.845 --> 01:33:20.546]  Exactly.
[01:33:20.586 --> 01:33:20.886]  You know?
[01:33:20.906 --> 01:33:23.389]  Or maybe, Dreaming of the Ultimate Espresso.
[01:33:23.609 --> 01:33:25.010]  But Bob, you really should settle down today.
[01:33:25.030 --> 01:33:25.871]  This has been kind of a crowd.
[01:33:25.891 --> 01:33:27.032]  I've never seen you act like this.
[01:33:27.372 --> 01:33:31.854]  You're going to be sitting there with a shopping cart next to you with a sign that says my other car was a Mercedes.
[01:33:31.974 --> 01:33:34.015]  You know, people tell me that I shouldn't be so serious.
[01:33:34.035 --> 01:33:35.996]  Let me tell you the truth.
[01:33:36.337 --> 01:33:37.777]  I'm having trouble being serious all the time.
[01:33:37.797 --> 01:33:39.538]  I am sick of the New World Order, aren't you Bob?
[01:33:40.079 --> 01:33:41.239]  Yeah, but you know what?
[01:33:41.339 --> 01:33:43.080]  It's kind of fun fighting them, you know?
[01:33:43.860 --> 01:33:45.141]  I don't have any trouble sleeping at night.
[01:33:45.361 --> 01:33:45.781]  I really don't.
[01:33:45.801 --> 01:33:46.822]  But see, you're a real man.
[01:33:47.182 --> 01:33:48.363]  And you're not a macho guy.
[01:33:48.383 --> 01:33:50.004]  You're not a guy that gets into being a tough guy.
[01:33:50.024 --> 01:33:52.445]  But you know, your whole family, military folks, cops, people like that.
[01:33:52.965 --> 01:33:56.970]  And, you know, you're people that really do love America, so as a real patriot, you're actually fighting the new world order.
[01:33:57.330 --> 01:34:09.684]  Not all these fake conservatives that, like I was talking about during the break, they go to the gym and they walk around looking at everybody and acting tough and swaggering, but if somebody's violating their rights, they literally start peeing down the side of their leg.
[01:34:10.285 --> 01:34:24.895]  If somebody pushes them around, or the IRS does something, they crap their pants, and they live this life of cowardice to government, and they rationalize that the government isn't corrupt, and the government isn't bad, and they cower in fear of what their neighbors would think if they were to come out and fight the New World Order.
[01:34:25.376 --> 01:34:36.784]  And they, you know, we need you to be real men out there, and real women, and just stop being so stupid, and stop... I mean, you know, these good old boys will get mad if their neighbor parks in their parking space.
[01:34:37.364 --> 01:34:41.947]  But they could care less if somebody's putting sodium fluoride that eats holes in their brains in their water.
[01:34:41.967 --> 01:34:43.188]  I mean, Bob, you get the point I'm making?
[01:34:43.688 --> 01:34:45.269]  I completely understand the point you're making.
[01:34:45.309 --> 01:34:59.619]  Today in my store, we always talk politics in the store, a customer comes in and listens to us talking about the proposed terms of the bailout, and he just comes up to the front and he says, hey, they're not going to let those executives have any of that money, that's good!
[01:35:04.782 --> 01:35:08.344]  And they're going to make them pay back the money in five years!
[01:35:08.384 --> 01:35:14.467]  So like, you're hearing him regurgitate the pre-packaged propaganda, where they told, we'll get the executives, oh yes!
[01:35:15.208 --> 01:35:17.109]  Not the shareholders though, the Rothschilds!
[01:35:17.449 --> 01:35:20.491]  I mean, when I heard that, I thought, this guy's just falling for a hook, line, and sinker.
[01:35:20.511 --> 01:35:21.671]  Of course, I straightened him out.
[01:35:21.811 --> 01:35:24.753]  I don't know if he left straightened out, but I explained what it actually was.
[01:35:24.753 --> 01:35:26.855]  Well that's another thing, these guys never want to admit when they're wrong.
[01:35:26.875 --> 01:35:28.016]  I want to know if I'm wrong.
[01:35:28.356 --> 01:35:29.618]  I want to know if I'm being conned.
[01:35:29.638 --> 01:35:35.163]  A lot of these, you know, good old boy types, they're into, you just shut your mouth, Al-Qaeda!
[01:35:35.303 --> 01:35:36.604]  You know what I find out about you, Alex?
[01:35:36.624 --> 01:35:37.946]  I want to tell you something about you.
[01:35:38.426 --> 01:35:44.272]  You know, I get all these comments about, you know, I'm on TV in Austin and all, and they talk about, oh Alex Jones, you know Alex Jones.
[01:35:44.672 --> 01:35:48.335]  And a lot of people love to criticize you because of how
[01:35:49.502 --> 01:35:51.303]  Bombastic you are, or whatever, you know.
[01:35:51.904 --> 01:35:52.824]  And you know what I tell them?
[01:35:53.365 --> 01:35:57.067]  I say, I'm going to tell you what's wrong with Alex Jones.
[01:35:57.247 --> 01:35:58.548]  I'll tell you, because I know the guy.
[01:35:59.128 --> 01:36:02.030]  What's wrong with Alex Jones is he knows more than you do.
[01:36:02.931 --> 01:36:03.391]  And that's it.
[01:36:04.372 --> 01:36:04.652]  That's it.
[01:36:05.745 --> 01:36:07.067]  That's your problem, you know too much.
[01:36:07.247 --> 01:36:08.909]  Well, you've been around long enough to know my story.
[01:36:09.950 --> 01:36:21.381]  I saw when my dad came back one day from the IRS, he used to be talking about it, and he said, I've always paid, I have a CPA, and they sat across the table from him in Dallas, and they said, we're white-crawler criminals, we're going to take everything you have.
[01:36:21.401 --> 01:36:22.282]  And they laughed at him.
[01:36:22.822 --> 01:36:27.128]  I remember seeing my dad when I was 12 years old at the dinner table.
[01:36:27.208 --> 01:36:28.449]  I knew he was straight-laced.
[01:36:28.469 --> 01:36:29.691]  He stopped and changed tires.
[01:36:30.372 --> 01:36:32.094]  Me and my mother would say, please don't stop.
[01:36:32.114 --> 01:36:33.936]  He stopped at every car.
[01:36:34.016 --> 01:36:35.919]  Really goody-two-shoes, but also a smart, nice guy.
[01:36:36.379 --> 01:36:38.642]  I watched him get pushed around, cheated, things like that.
[01:36:38.963 --> 01:36:39.844]  Then my grandparents...
[01:36:40.785 --> 01:36:44.386]  They didn't even own this creek behind their house, but the city gave them $2,000 a day fines.
[01:36:44.706 --> 01:36:50.047]  While I was covering him doing this to other old people, my grandpa went back there, cleaned it out, had a heart attack, and basically later killed him.
[01:36:50.507 --> 01:36:59.348]  And so that's the kind of thing, I mean, you know, in America, you're not supposed to have some bastard from the city making your grandparents clean out city property so they can try to steal their house.
[01:36:59.748 --> 01:37:09.130]  Or you're not supposed to, I remember going to ranchers' and farmers' houses after I got on air, when the city was stealing it for environmental reasons, giggling and laughing that they were going to sell it all to developers later.
[01:37:09.730 --> 01:37:11.551]  And that pissed me off.
[01:37:11.871 --> 01:37:13.891]  And I'm not a good guy.
[01:37:14.192 --> 01:37:15.132]  I'm a normal person.
[01:37:15.232 --> 01:37:19.993]  As a man, when criminals are robbing people of their land, that pisses me off, Bob.
[01:37:20.394 --> 01:37:21.374]  And well it should.
[01:37:21.634 --> 01:37:23.715]  But people always thank me.
[01:37:23.795 --> 01:37:24.795]  I don't need to be thanked.
[01:37:25.335 --> 01:37:27.656]  Aren't we supposed to be mad about being screwed?
[01:37:27.836 --> 01:37:28.356]  Absolutely.
[01:37:28.896 --> 01:37:35.458]  I've got news for anybody that's on the fringe of whether they want to get involved in fighting the New World Order or not.
[01:37:35.498 --> 01:37:38.378]  I've been doing this now, fighting the New World Order, for ten years.
[01:37:39.419 --> 01:37:45.420]  My response, and I have some national following now, and I've got a lot of local following.
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:49.281]  My response to that is, in my own personal experience,
[01:37:49.961 --> 01:37:56.323]  I would say 99.5% of my direct responses from people have been positive.
[01:37:56.983 --> 01:38:04.404]  And that little .5% that's negative is coming from guys that are supposed to be on our side that just disagree with our methodology.
[01:38:04.504 --> 01:38:05.825]  No, they like to bitch.
[01:38:06.065 --> 01:38:08.805]  They're in this to be studs and to be leaders.
[01:38:09.366 --> 01:38:11.726]  And they get sick of hearing Alex Jones' name.
[01:38:12.026 --> 01:38:14.807]  Hey folks, I'm not Bernanke taking your money.
[01:38:15.447 --> 01:38:19.109]  And that's what's wrong about this, is we're a nation of second-guessers.
[01:38:19.569 --> 01:38:21.470]  And it's fine to second-guess if you're on the field.
[01:38:21.890 --> 01:38:29.694]  But they're sitting up in the peanut gallery, bitching and complaining, and they haven't walked a mile, or a hundred miles, or a thousand miles in our shoes, Bob.
[01:38:31.455 --> 01:38:34.477]  I wish I could go back in time and get a hold of
[01:38:35.390 --> 01:38:38.175]  Of Paul Revere and Patrick Henry.
[01:38:38.275 --> 01:38:39.818]  Al-Qaeda Revere, according to the government?
[01:38:39.858 --> 01:38:45.047]  Paul Revere and Patrick Henry, and take a look at them and see whether or not you are both of those guys reincarnated.
[01:38:45.087 --> 01:38:45.788]  Oh, please!
[01:38:48.266 --> 01:38:50.187]  Bob, you need to quit being so nice to me, please.
[01:38:50.207 --> 01:38:59.071]  Oh man, I tell you what, you know... You know, it actually makes me feel bad, though, because I realize I'm not doing a good enough job, I don't work hard enough in this fight, and I'm just doing my... Well, here's another one, here's another one, Alex.
[01:38:59.431 --> 01:39:01.012]  You know, you're just a guy.
[01:39:01.672 --> 01:39:01.972]  You know?
[01:39:02.232 --> 01:39:03.533]  I mean, you know, you're just a guy.
[01:39:03.773 --> 01:39:07.474]  Jason Burmess has been down here for several months working on his film down here, right?
[01:39:07.654 --> 01:39:07.874]  Yeah.
[01:39:07.895 --> 01:39:13.417]  Okay, he's got this, he's got the number one film in the history of the internet, Loose Change, second edition.
[01:39:13.837 --> 01:39:16.299]  He comes up with another one, Loose Chains Final Cut.
[01:39:16.579 --> 01:39:19.381]  He's down here in your area, here in Austin, for several months.
[01:39:19.901 --> 01:39:23.444]  He was on our show, Simple Truth, locally here three times.
[01:39:23.884 --> 01:39:24.445]  And guess what?
[01:39:25.045 --> 01:39:27.206]  Jason Burmess is just a guy!
[01:39:28.052 --> 01:39:29.632]  Just a nice guy.
[01:39:29.712 --> 01:39:30.133]  That's all.
[01:39:30.493 --> 01:39:31.513]  He's not pretentious.
[01:39:31.893 --> 01:39:33.053]  He's just a nice guy.
[01:39:33.473 --> 01:39:34.734]  And that's who we are.
[01:39:34.774 --> 01:39:37.154]  And he's not borderline insane like me, so that's good.
[01:39:37.234 --> 01:39:41.495]  Yeah, well, he's not as bombastic as you are, you know, but he's just a nice guy.
[01:39:41.715 --> 01:39:46.877]  The people that we work with in this movement, by and large, are just people.
[01:39:46.937 --> 01:39:48.037]  Just regular folks.
[01:39:48.177 --> 01:39:52.863]  Well, and I want to point that out, and I want to point out to those that detract who claim they're in our movement.
[01:39:53.123 --> 01:39:57.428]  A lot of them are feds, but a lot of them are just, they're the damaged goods of America.
[01:39:57.469 --> 01:40:01.674]  And so they woke up, but they still can't shed, you know, the things they do and the way they operate.
[01:40:01.874 --> 01:40:02.555]  But that's okay.
[01:40:02.575 --> 01:40:05.398]  We have to ignore those people, not spend our time on it and move on.
[01:40:05.699 --> 01:40:06.039]  But Bob,
[01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:08.242]  I want to take the last 15 minutes.
[01:40:08.262 --> 01:40:10.164]  We've got 20 left, but in the last 15 I want to take calls.
[01:40:10.204 --> 01:40:11.186]  I promise.
[01:40:11.206 --> 01:40:11.927]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:40:12.848 --> 01:40:13.569]  We're about to go to them.
[01:40:13.849 --> 01:40:16.292]  But Bob, before we do that, there were some other things in your list.
[01:40:16.353 --> 01:40:19.176]  I mean, run through the gamut quickly of your points, because they're so good.
[01:40:21.396 --> 01:40:29.684]  The point is, in order to understand this, you have to understand that the powers that be are not trying to fix anything.
[01:40:30.405 --> 01:40:35.850]  If you think, like the press says, that they're trying to fix the economy, they're not trying to fix the economy.
[01:40:36.030 --> 01:40:41.415]  They're trying to affix themselves to your wallet, transfer all their bad debt to you,
[01:40:42.636 --> 01:40:43.977]  And abscond with the goods.
[01:40:44.738 --> 01:40:57.208]  If you think that the leaders of the House, the leaders of the Senate, the people in the Federal Reserve, the executive branch, Bush and crowd, you think they're trying to help you, you are so off base, you're never going to get it.
[01:40:57.588 --> 01:41:02.933]  I mean, even Ben Sargent, who we can't stand, you know, he's a cartoonist for the American Statesman.
[01:41:03.093 --> 01:41:05.154]  He draws some pretty good cartoons every once in a while.
[01:41:05.535 --> 01:41:08.457]  He had a cartoon the other day where you had this
[01:41:11.158 --> 01:41:15.901]  This used car salesman, which was the Treasury Secretary, trying to sell us used cars, as is!
[01:41:16.341 --> 01:41:30.409]  You've got to take the whole thing, and that's all there is to it, and this woman is looking at the used car salesman, and Bush is standing behind the used car salesman, and the woman says, aren't you the same guys that sold us the Patriot Act as is, and the Iraq War as is?
[01:41:31.150 --> 01:41:32.070]  I mean, wake up!
[01:41:32.631 --> 01:41:33.491]  You know, wake up!
[01:41:33.892 --> 01:41:39.515]  Now that we're trying to sell you this as is, and I think maybe, just maybe, we're starting to wake up.
[01:41:40.023 --> 01:41:42.585]  Well, let's look at what the stock market's doing right now.
[01:41:43.125 --> 01:41:48.789]  Gold has exploded in price today, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:49.790 --> 01:41:51.531]  It is up over $33.
[01:41:51.651 --> 01:41:52.552]  Oh my gosh, I just hit refresh.
[01:41:52.572 --> 01:41:53.232]  I'm sorry.
[01:41:53.252 --> 01:41:54.573]  It's up $40.20 right now.
[01:41:54.593 --> 01:41:54.573]  $40.20.
[01:41:54.613 --> 01:41:55.734]  Ted is offering gold that he bought at $8.75.
[01:42:09.096 --> 01:42:26.363]  And he has that position locked in, so there's a little markup for the guys, you know, to take the call, but that's... Tell you what, go grab Ted in here for just 60 seconds, because this is too... He said he's going to hold this until the end of the day regardless, but gold is now at $40.20 over what he's selling it for.
[01:42:26.783 --> 01:42:29.564]  Now, he already bought it, so he can sell it to you, but I don't know how much he has.
[01:42:29.964 --> 01:42:32.525]  He says he's going to midnight with this.
[01:42:33.445 --> 01:42:35.246]  Bob Finisher of The Points, we're going to go to some calls here.
[01:42:36.004 --> 01:42:37.106]  Well, let me see.
[01:42:37.126 --> 01:42:39.590]  You've got a lot of yellow notepads.
[01:42:39.650 --> 01:42:40.932]  I've got a lot of yellow notepads.
[01:42:40.952 --> 01:42:41.413]  I always have.
[01:42:41.453 --> 01:42:42.575]  Hundreds of fine points.
[01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:51.222]  I want to say that this, you know, back about three years ago I went to Baylor University for the New American.
[01:42:51.903 --> 01:42:53.823]  They were talking about this free trade of the Americas.
[01:42:54.164 --> 01:42:59.566]  And I was talking to the heads of the economics department at Baylor, the business school people.
[01:42:59.766 --> 01:43:01.727]  They had a little get-together before the conference.
[01:43:02.088 --> 01:43:04.129]  The head guys, the deans of the schools.
[01:43:04.589 --> 01:43:07.070]  And I was a reporter and I was talking to them about economics.
[01:43:07.230 --> 01:43:08.451]  That's when Lord Fox and
[01:43:10.086 --> 01:43:11.527]  Yeah, but that was after Fox.
[01:43:11.787 --> 01:43:14.068]  That was the follow-up meeting to that meeting in Baylor.
[01:43:14.648 --> 01:43:25.493]  And I was talking to him about economics, and I'm not an economist, but I mentioned that I believed in the Austrian school of economics, Ludwig von Mises, or whatever, von Mises, however you pronounce it.
[01:43:26.013 --> 01:43:29.335]  And these guys looked at me like they literally
[01:43:29.955 --> 01:43:31.656]  Hadn't even heard the term.
[01:43:31.676 --> 01:43:32.537]  They hadn't even heard of it!
[01:43:32.557 --> 01:43:39.341]  Well, most of these economists at school just go to little parties and play golf and, I have to say, pick their nose all day.
[01:43:39.361 --> 01:43:40.482]  Scratch the crack of their pants.
[01:43:41.503 --> 01:43:50.208]  Well, I mean, they are so educated in the system that they didn't even understand what Austrian economics was.
[01:43:50.709 --> 01:43:52.290]  Maybe I ought to listen to Ron Paul now, huh?
[01:43:53.491 --> 01:43:54.352]  See, that's what's happening.
[01:43:54.452 --> 01:43:55.674]  Bob Dacey isn't that smart.
[01:43:55.714 --> 01:43:56.355]  I'm not that smart.
[01:43:56.375 --> 01:43:57.136]  We're just average people.
[01:43:57.156 --> 01:43:57.876]  We're not stupid.
[01:43:58.237 --> 01:44:00.580]  And we've decided we better find out what's going on in the world.
[01:44:00.940 --> 01:44:02.983]  And then you find out that criminals are running wild.
[01:44:03.003 --> 01:44:04.084]  I mean, that's really all we're doing.
[01:44:04.285 --> 01:44:08.370]  And then every time you go, hey, there's crime, the public says, that does not exist in high places.
[01:44:08.550 --> 01:44:12.253]  Well, and if you show the crime, then you're a conspiracy theorist.
[01:44:12.293 --> 01:44:13.354]  And I don't deal in theory.
[01:44:13.454 --> 01:44:13.975]  I really don't.
[01:44:14.355 --> 01:44:16.057]  I never really have much.
[01:44:16.277 --> 01:44:16.857]  I just deal in fact.
[01:44:16.897 --> 01:44:19.600]  I'll tell you who engages in theories is the government and the media.
[01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:21.802]  Yeah, there's some real theories out there.
[01:44:22.042 --> 01:44:23.443]  Like 9-11 official story.
[01:44:23.463 --> 01:44:24.484]  Now there's a crock right there.
[01:44:26.966 --> 01:44:28.747]  Now there's a conspiracy theory.
[01:44:28.767 --> 01:44:29.787]  9-11, what a conspiracy theory.
[01:44:30.187 --> 01:44:33.389]  And if you've studied 9-11 as much as we have... Bob, I'm going to have you back up sooner.
[01:44:33.429 --> 01:44:36.151]  I know I've gone crazy today, but we're going to have you up soon.
[01:44:36.171 --> 01:44:42.554]  We're going to take calls here in a moment, but Ted Anderson, gold is up over $40 from when you bought it Friday.
[01:44:42.574 --> 01:44:47.757]  You have it $40 cheaper than what it's now being sold for when you factor it in.
[01:44:48.157 --> 01:44:50.699]  I mean, you're going to be able to hold this deal today.
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:53.220]  Ted?
[01:44:53.700 --> 01:44:53.900]  Ted?
[01:44:55.069 --> 01:45:00.190]  Ted Anderson is in the Minnesota studio, but he is not coming to the microphone.
[01:45:00.210 --> 01:45:09.393]  I don't know why they have the studio in a separate room in the control room, but he's obviously on the cell phone or playing TiddlyWinks or something's going on.
[01:45:09.553 --> 01:45:10.633]  I guess we don't have him, John?
[01:45:11.493 --> 01:45:12.433]  Yeah, sorry about that, Alex.
[01:45:12.474 --> 01:45:14.254]  I was just printing up the latest market quotes.
[01:45:15.407 --> 01:45:16.348]  What a crazy day.
[01:45:16.668 --> 01:45:17.248]  Are you there still?
[01:45:17.368 --> 01:45:17.828]  Yes, sir.
[01:45:17.848 --> 01:45:19.069]  Boy, I tell you.
[01:45:19.769 --> 01:45:22.951]  And the markets are just, you know, in the toilet.
[01:45:23.011 --> 01:45:23.751]  Gold and silver.
[01:45:23.771 --> 01:45:25.372]  You know, gold is up like crazy.
[01:45:25.392 --> 01:45:26.233]  Yeah, how far down?
[01:45:26.293 --> 01:45:28.454]  The market was almost 600 points down when I last looked.
[01:45:28.474 --> 01:45:28.994]  Yeah, I know.
[01:45:29.034 --> 01:45:30.755]  It's just been volatile as ever.
[01:45:31.315 --> 01:45:34.677]  And like I said, Alex, I mean, the gold and silver market's just been strong.
[01:45:34.697 --> 01:45:35.778]  And I really apologize.
[01:45:35.798 --> 01:45:37.518]  I was just trying to pull up the latest Kitco.
[01:45:38.879 --> 01:45:39.159]  It is.
[01:45:39.219 --> 01:45:40.280]  It's been just crazy.
[01:45:40.340 --> 01:45:41.320]  The people are calling it.
[01:45:41.481 --> 01:45:42.241]  They really should.
[01:45:42.927 --> 01:45:48.852]  I still have those British Sovereigns and the Franks at the same price level.
[01:45:48.872 --> 01:45:50.093]  I didn't change those at all.
[01:45:50.673 --> 01:45:52.995]  And obviously, gold's now up over $36.
[01:45:53.035 --> 01:45:57.779]  Now, Ted, it's up more than that.
[01:45:57.819 --> 01:45:59.500]  I'm sorry, they just brought me in a printout here.
[01:45:59.540 --> 01:46:00.421]  Let me take a look here.
[01:46:00.641 --> 01:46:02.022]  Well, it's going up and down.
[01:46:02.062 --> 01:46:05.185]  We're looking at $9.1550 right now.
[01:46:05.905 --> 01:46:10.369]  And this one cut off the high of today, so I don't even get to see that.
[01:46:10.409 --> 01:46:11.970]  But yeah, the markets are just nuts.
[01:46:12.677 --> 01:46:24.923]  And people, I mean, just about everybody has a stake in either money in the bank, or they got money in the stock market, or they're looking at the annuities, or, I mean, you name it.
[01:46:24.963 --> 01:46:26.984]  I mean, there's so many different investments that are out there.
[01:46:27.024 --> 01:46:34.367]  You've got IRAs sitting in mutual funds, or you're sitting in... Well, Ted, I'm not going to trust gold and silver in my personal possession.
[01:46:34.488 --> 01:46:35.748]  I'm going to trust the bankers.
[01:46:36.148 --> 01:46:37.509]  So I'm going to go invest in
[01:46:42.851 --> 01:46:53.561]  The paper market is so gyrating right now.
[01:46:54.703 --> 01:47:02.771]  This exposes the weaknesses and the manipulation of what the Fed's been doing, and now it's just hitting mainstream and everybody's waking up to this fact.
[01:47:03.411 --> 01:47:19.781]  And gold and silver is in short supply, so people should know, listening, that when the general public, I was going to say public, finally, fumbling public, finally figures this out, Katie, bar the door, you're not going to be able to probably get gold or silver at any price.
[01:47:20.101 --> 01:47:22.402]  I mean, that is a real potential we're looking at, Ted.
[01:47:22.943 --> 01:47:23.303]  It is.
[01:47:23.483 --> 01:47:26.185]  Alex, I can tell you right now, supply is tough.
[01:47:26.265 --> 01:47:28.546]  I mean, you can go out there and you can Google it, like you said.
[01:47:29.071 --> 01:47:31.253]  It's right on the very front page of Kitco.
[01:47:31.474 --> 01:47:33.776]  It's a qualification right on the very first page.
[01:47:34.296 --> 01:47:35.938]  I mean, it is tough.
[01:47:36.178 --> 01:47:38.721]  The silver dollars were just non-existent.
[01:47:38.781 --> 01:47:43.105]  I still have some of those right now, but they're poking up there at about $20 a piece.
[01:47:43.746 --> 01:47:46.569]  And right now, you can still pick up the dimes at about $16 per face.
[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:52.201]  For the collector type dimes, not the ones that are junk silver like you have.
[01:47:52.701 --> 01:47:54.082]  I don't understand this.
[01:47:54.122 --> 01:47:59.663]  I was on Kidco and it said $40 up, and then it says $32 up, but doesn't show the bar dropping.
[01:47:59.723 --> 01:48:00.504]  It's all insane.
[01:48:01.424 --> 01:48:02.324]  It's hard to catch up.
[01:48:02.344 --> 01:48:03.985]  There's so much volatility right now.
[01:48:04.025 --> 01:48:05.825]  You're going to have to take a look back.
[01:48:06.085 --> 01:48:08.426]  But I will hold these prices until this evening.
[01:48:08.986 --> 01:48:13.107]  And people are going to be crazy now.
[01:48:13.127 --> 01:48:13.447]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:48:13.867 --> 01:48:16.208]  Okay, let's thank you, Ted, for coming on.
[01:48:16.368 --> 01:48:17.989]  Yeah, thanks for having me up again, Alex.
[01:48:18.229 --> 01:48:18.469]  You bet.
[01:48:18.489 --> 01:48:21.230]  I wanted to have Ted pop in and just offer one more time.
[01:48:21.730 --> 01:48:22.470]  Ted, be specific.
[01:48:22.650 --> 01:48:23.150]  You already left?
[01:48:23.730 --> 01:48:24.310]  I'm here still.
[01:48:24.350 --> 01:48:26.511]  You bought gold at what, and it's now being offered at what?
[01:48:26.531 --> 01:48:32.893]  Well, I mean, when we worked on it, it was trading right in that $8.79 range last Friday to $8.82.
[01:48:33.553 --> 01:48:35.314]  I can't remember exactly where it closed at.
[01:48:37.196 --> 01:48:46.444]  But I was able to accumulate a position at the same British Sovereigns I offered on your show on Friday at the same exactly price that I'm offering them today.
[01:48:47.364 --> 01:48:49.766]  Same with the French Franc and same with the Silver Coins.
[01:48:50.147 --> 01:48:54.010]  I mean, I'm holding that deal because I was able to get in there and do something.
[01:48:54.030 --> 01:48:55.431]  I mean, to me it was obvious.
[01:48:55.531 --> 01:48:59.474]  I mean, if they bail out the banks, it could have gone either way.
[01:48:59.494 --> 01:49:02.517]  If they bailed out the banks, we knew the dollar was going to crash.
[01:49:03.024 --> 01:49:08.109]  If they didn't bail out the banks, we knew that there was going to be tremendous volatility in the stock market.
[01:49:08.149 --> 01:49:09.811]  And either way, people win with gold.
[01:49:10.191 --> 01:49:11.553]  It's a win-win situation.
[01:49:12.113 --> 01:49:26.988]  In the depression of the 1930s, we went through this deflationary depression because there was no way for the Federal Reserve System to get the money into the economy fast enough to replace the money that was being defaulted on.
[01:49:27.348 --> 01:49:31.132]  Every time there's a default in the economy, that money supply disappears.
[01:49:31.712 --> 01:49:33.154]  Dollar for dollar it goes away.
[01:49:34.555 --> 01:49:36.116]  No, there's no inflation.
[01:49:36.797 --> 01:49:37.818]  So here's the thing.
[01:49:37.878 --> 01:49:39.219]  It's a little different right now, Alex.
[01:49:39.259 --> 01:49:42.943]  We've got all these government programs that the government has to cover.
[01:49:43.763 --> 01:49:45.085]  They're already on the hook for it.
[01:49:45.545 --> 01:49:48.788]  When inflation starts rising and the tax base starts to drop,
[01:49:49.289 --> 01:49:57.379]  And the United States Treasury is going to have to pay out unemployment benefits and all these different... No, no, the economy is wonderful and so long.
[01:49:57.399 --> 01:49:59.222]  Just hand over your firearms, everything will be fine.
[01:49:59.822 --> 01:50:00.643]  Bob, you wanted to comment?
[01:50:00.784 --> 01:50:05.509]  Yeah, Ted, you just said something that really needs to be pointed out when the tax base starts to drop.
[01:50:06.030 --> 01:50:08.612]  You know, they're relying on... They just keep raising sales taxes.
[01:50:08.632 --> 01:50:13.336]  They're relying on communism to bail out capitalism, crony capitalism.
[01:50:13.716 --> 01:50:21.742]  And when the government, say, owns 80% of AIG, well that means any money that AIG makes is no longer in the tax base.
[01:50:21.923 --> 01:50:22.763]  And that's what he's talking about.
[01:50:22.803 --> 01:50:23.544]  You're shrinking the tax base.
[01:50:23.564 --> 01:50:28.988]  And also, then those government bureaucrats get to pimp over their own little baronies, and then selectively enforce.
[01:50:29.008 --> 01:50:30.990]  You think there's going to be less corruption in AIG?
[01:50:31.290 --> 01:50:32.391]  It's going to get worse now.
[01:50:32.611 --> 01:50:36.934]  Yeah, and then the government's going to funnel money to them at the expense of the other insurance companies, because they own it!
[01:50:50.043 --> 01:50:50.443]  Government.
[01:50:51.024 --> 01:50:52.624]  Government is best that governs lease.
[01:50:54.025 --> 01:51:02.769]  Uh, by the way, that Liberty sticker, I like them, but they took my 1984 to 1776, the answer 1984 to 1776, and they didn't, on their bumper sticker, didn't give me credit.
[01:51:03.069 --> 01:51:03.749]  Oh, shame on them.
[01:51:03.789 --> 01:51:06.591]  For coining that, and that's fine, but they give everybody else a quote.
[01:51:06.711 --> 01:51:07.651]  Well, those are good guys.
[01:51:07.711 --> 01:51:08.092]  I like them.
[01:51:08.132 --> 01:51:12.534]  They are good guys, but I want my name on the sticker!
[01:51:13.634 --> 01:51:15.195]  Turnabout is fair play, turkeys!
[01:51:16.795 --> 01:51:17.935]  I don't know, I'm just joking around.
[01:51:18.716 --> 01:51:19.336]  I don't even care.
[01:51:19.416 --> 01:51:21.436]  The point is, I think that's kind of a cute little saying.
[01:51:21.797 --> 01:51:22.797]  It was a great saying.
[01:51:22.977 --> 01:51:26.438]  Are you the one that did the Founding Father material quote for Ron Paul?
[01:51:26.478 --> 01:51:26.718]  Yes.
[01:51:26.918 --> 01:51:28.239]  Well, you should get credit for that one, too.
[01:51:28.259 --> 01:51:29.059]  No, I get nothing!
[01:51:29.139 --> 01:51:30.059]  I get hatred!
[01:51:30.299 --> 01:51:33.600]  Oh, well, that's because you're, you know, you're over the target.
[01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:34.441]  You get the flack, right?
[01:51:34.461 --> 01:51:34.961]  That's right.
[01:51:34.981 --> 01:51:35.781]  That's right.
[01:51:35.941 --> 01:51:36.461]  Absolutely.
[01:51:37.001 --> 01:51:37.782]  I don't even care.
[01:51:37.842 --> 01:51:41.783]  It's just that, you know, I come up with these little... I've come up with a lot of other sayings.
[01:51:42.870 --> 01:51:43.350]  By the way.
[01:51:44.210 --> 01:51:47.931]  Maybe you ought to write a little red book of Alex Jones' famous sayings and sell it.
[01:51:48.691 --> 01:51:49.632]  I don't even care anymore.
[01:51:49.652 --> 01:51:50.772]  I haven't even plugged my videos.
[01:51:50.792 --> 01:51:52.352]  They're a huge part of the solution here.
[01:51:52.772 --> 01:51:54.213]  And I'm not even plugging those.
[01:51:54.593 --> 01:51:55.593]  I'm plugging nothing.
[01:51:55.733 --> 01:51:57.253]  The sayings of Chairman Alex.
[01:51:57.293 --> 01:51:58.074]  You could have a little book.
[01:51:58.314 --> 01:51:58.754]  Think about it.
[01:51:58.774 --> 01:52:00.034]  A little red one?
[01:52:00.194 --> 01:52:00.894]  Yeah, a little red one.
[01:52:00.994 --> 01:52:06.776]  Because, you know, obviously you're a communist, obviously.
[01:52:07.116 --> 01:52:08.096]  Oh, Jesus, help me.
[01:52:08.236 --> 01:52:09.376]  Alright, alright.
[01:52:09.396 --> 01:52:10.697]  Let's go to Dan in Alabama.
[01:52:10.717 --> 01:52:11.517]  You're on the air, Dan.
[01:52:13.464 --> 01:52:14.265]  Hello, Dano!
[01:52:15.046 --> 01:52:15.486]  Oh, yes.
[01:52:16.467 --> 01:52:17.068]  Book him, Dano!
[01:52:17.148 --> 01:52:18.089]  Everybody's mentioning.
[01:52:18.590 --> 01:52:19.090]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:52:19.431 --> 01:52:23.395]  The biggest trouble we got, we got oil, we run out of gas in Alabama.
[01:52:23.776 --> 01:52:27.019]  Gas is up in oil, is 50 cents a gallon.
[01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:30.343]  And the Council on Foreign Relations that owns the Senate,
[01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:34.401]  That's the one that's causing 90% of our trouble.
[01:52:34.581 --> 01:52:37.823]  Yeah, they admit that it was set up by the British to take over the U.S.
[01:52:37.843 --> 01:52:40.264]  government, and that's in official government documents.
[01:52:40.344 --> 01:52:47.226]  If the states would just start recalling some of these Senators and get them out, that might just scare them enough to do something.
[01:52:47.246 --> 01:52:50.888]  Remember 15 years ago when Rush Limbaugh said the CFR didn't exist?
[01:52:51.508 --> 01:52:55.730]  And then the Internet came along and people found out they did exist, and now they have to come out on C-SPAN and TV.
[01:52:56.590 --> 01:52:57.990]  God, he should have no credibility.
[01:52:58.751 --> 01:53:00.611]  He knew all about this a long time ago.
[01:53:01.251 --> 01:53:02.692]  He actually admitted it in his books.
[01:53:02.732 --> 01:53:06.453]  Just get something started and get Senators recalled.
[01:53:06.493 --> 01:53:08.233]  CFR Senators recalled.
[01:53:08.453 --> 01:53:11.954]  Well, we used to be able to do that before the 17th Amendment.
[01:53:11.994 --> 01:53:13.535]  The Senators were creatures of the state.
[01:53:13.575 --> 01:53:14.435]  Bob, you're for that, aren't you?
[01:53:15.051 --> 01:53:15.531]  Well, yeah.
[01:53:15.772 --> 01:53:16.672]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:53:16.732 --> 01:53:19.254]  Because, you know, they screw everything up.
[01:53:19.274 --> 01:53:19.835]  That's what they do.
[01:53:19.875 --> 01:53:23.097]  But that Limbaugh thing, listen, Limbaugh knows all about this stuff.
[01:53:23.577 --> 01:53:24.278]  He wrote about it.
[01:53:24.318 --> 01:53:26.479]  He talked about it way back many years ago.
[01:53:26.620 --> 01:53:27.981]  New World Order, the whole nine yards.
[01:53:28.241 --> 01:53:32.724]  He's been exposed to the same material that you were exposed to, and something made him flip.
[01:53:32.944 --> 01:53:34.966]  You know, maybe that was job security or something.
[01:53:35.006 --> 01:53:37.768]  Maybe that was that $290-something million dollar contract?
[01:53:37.788 --> 01:53:38.208]  Could have been.
[01:53:38.348 --> 01:53:38.728]  Could have been.
[01:53:38.989 --> 01:53:39.189]  Yeah.
[01:53:39.369 --> 01:53:40.670]  It's called selling out for the money.
[01:53:41.090 --> 01:53:46.954]  Alright, hey listen Dan, I appreciate your call, but don't criticize the Senate or the local police will just say it doesn't exist.
[01:53:48.295 --> 01:53:49.555]  I appreciate your call Dan, here we go.
[01:53:49.916 --> 01:53:55.399]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:55.479 --> 01:53:59.021]  Matt in New York, you're on in the final segment with Bob Dacey.
[01:54:00.723 --> 01:54:01.603]  Hey, hey brother Jones.
[01:54:01.983 --> 01:54:02.284]  Hi.
[01:54:03.144 --> 01:54:03.564]  How you doing?
[01:54:03.604 --> 01:54:04.905]  Matt from We Are Change New York.
[01:54:05.285 --> 01:54:05.726]  Hey buddy.
[01:54:06.696 --> 01:54:08.097]  Enjoying your good humor today.
[01:54:08.117 --> 01:54:10.217]  I love that British elitist character.
[01:54:10.297 --> 01:54:11.318]  You've got to do some more of that.
[01:54:12.498 --> 01:54:13.499]  Excuse me.
[01:54:14.619 --> 01:54:16.520]  You know, I'm actually calling to get some shame.
[01:54:18.501 --> 01:54:21.102]  I'm actually calling to get some shameless plus in here.
[01:54:21.602 --> 01:54:22.943]  That's what the phone calls are for.
[01:54:23.683 --> 01:54:25.664]  You know, we've got a couple of really big things going on.
[01:54:25.684 --> 01:54:28.485]  You know, they changed our bill number again.
[01:54:28.725 --> 01:54:31.186]  The James Adroga bill.
[01:54:31.386 --> 01:54:31.746]  It's now H.R.
[01:54:31.766 --> 01:54:31.746]  7174.
[01:54:31.786 --> 01:54:32.707]  Tell folks specifically what that is.
[01:54:37.045 --> 01:54:46.651]  What that is, is that's the Health and Compensation Act to take all of the dying first responders who are missing right now and give them a little bit of a platform to maybe survive.
[01:54:46.912 --> 01:54:51.014]  Yeah, and Congress keeps saying no to that because you can't give the firemen and police any help, you know.
[01:54:51.875 --> 01:54:54.397]  Hey, but listen, we got 219 Congressmen.
[01:54:54.477 --> 01:54:55.878]  I never expected that to happen.
[01:54:55.918 --> 01:54:56.298]  No, it's true.
[01:54:56.378 --> 01:55:03.383]  In fact, Truth Rising, I should add, tells that story and shows that you guys valiantly in Congress with Kucinich and others fighting for that.
[01:55:03.723 --> 01:55:04.964]  So, what's the plug, EWUG?
[01:55:06.087 --> 01:55:15.836]  The plug is, we've got to get on to loc.gov, find the congressman that didn't vote, yes, and call them, because we've got a couple of days, Congress is in session, we can get this thing passed.
[01:55:16.077 --> 01:55:18.138]  It takes nothing but 40 more votes.
[01:55:18.319 --> 01:55:20.821]  What bill, what bill, what bill is it attached to?
[01:55:20.841 --> 01:55:22.643]  It is HR 7174.
[01:55:22.903 --> 01:55:26.787]  It's what you look it up on loc.gov.
[01:55:26.807 --> 01:55:29.950]  No, no, I know about the bill, but it's not attached to a larger spending package?
[01:55:30.836 --> 01:55:31.938]  Not as far as I know of right now.
[01:55:31.958 --> 01:55:34.681]  That's probably not going to pass this session, but yeah, folks, your call.
[01:55:35.022 --> 01:55:36.023]  Good to hear from you, Matt.
[01:55:36.043 --> 01:55:37.164]  I really appreciate your call.
[01:55:37.184 --> 01:55:38.045]  Is this Matt Lepacek?
[01:55:39.828 --> 01:55:41.270]  Oh, I didn't mean to let him go there.
[01:55:41.310 --> 01:55:43.753]  Matt Lepacek's been on fire lately.
[01:55:43.793 --> 01:55:44.654]  Great, great guy.
[01:55:45.535 --> 01:55:46.536]  Those guys are awesome.
[01:55:47.395 --> 01:55:51.257]  In fact, I mean to get Luke and Matt and all those guys on the show very, very soon.
[01:55:52.097 --> 01:55:55.398]  I had all these sponsors I was supposed to plug, but it looks like they don't get theirs today.
[01:55:55.758 --> 01:55:57.779]  Well, you know, I know you, Alex.
[01:55:57.799 --> 01:56:01.521]  You're more interested in the information than you are in the commercial aspect of your enterprise.
[01:56:01.701 --> 01:56:02.201]  Are you kidding?
[01:56:02.261 --> 01:56:04.242]  I can't... I can't... Yeah, you are.
[01:56:04.262 --> 01:56:05.082]  I know.
[01:56:05.402 --> 01:56:05.722]  I know.
[01:56:05.742 --> 01:56:06.243]  I know.
[01:56:06.663 --> 01:56:06.923]  You know?
[01:56:07.303 --> 01:56:08.203]  That makes you honest.
[01:56:09.884 --> 01:56:12.905]  Well, I need to plug things, so that's what pays the bills, plus they're great products.
[01:56:13.145 --> 01:56:16.025]  In fact, speak of the devil, I'm just going to do that here at the end of the show.
[01:56:16.085 --> 01:56:24.007]  Bob Dacey, you know, go in there with Trey, and let's get you set up in about two weeks from now for two hours to come in and talk about all the stuff you're doing, because you're doing a lot.
[01:56:24.027 --> 01:56:33.309]  You have a lot of original research, and I got so ecstatic on that kind of trip, the endorphins in my brain, with the House voting this down, that I kind of got off skilter.
[01:56:33.729 --> 01:56:34.629]  Yeah, it's confusing.
[01:56:35.050 --> 01:56:36.950]  I'm still, really, I'm unsettled about it.
[01:56:37.010 --> 01:56:38.551]  I'm trying to sort it out.
[01:56:38.731 --> 01:56:39.972]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:56:40.032 --> 01:56:41.192]  It's going to fall somewhere.
[01:56:41.312 --> 01:56:43.953]  Go set yourself up for two weeks from now and I appreciate you coming in.
[01:56:44.053 --> 01:56:44.774]  Okay, thank you, Alex.
[01:56:44.814 --> 01:56:45.214]  I appreciate it.
[01:56:45.234 --> 01:56:45.714]  Bob, thanks for coming in.
[01:56:45.734 --> 01:56:47.555]  We're going to have you fill in on the show soon, too.
[01:56:47.835 --> 01:56:48.055]  Yeah.
[01:56:48.215 --> 01:56:48.775]  You do an excellent job.
[01:56:48.795 --> 01:56:50.976]  I'm just going to have somebody here to turn the mic up for you.
[01:56:51.497 --> 01:56:52.057]  But not today.
[01:56:52.077 --> 01:56:52.997]  I had to turn your mic down.
[01:56:53.237 --> 01:56:55.118]  Well, you know, that's because we got a little rambunctious.
[01:56:55.158 --> 01:56:55.578]  Take care, Alex.
[01:56:55.618 --> 01:56:59.040]  Hey, good to have you here and I really appreciate Bob Dacey coming in studio with us.
[01:57:00.376 --> 01:57:03.760]  Rebroadcast is about to start at InfoWars.com on the internet streams.
[01:57:03.780 --> 01:57:04.862]  You've got to go to those specific streams.
[01:57:04.882 --> 01:57:07.665]  I had a congressman on at the start of the show about martial law in the house.
[01:57:08.366 --> 01:57:10.869]  That starts right at the first of the show, five minutes in.
[01:57:11.210 --> 01:57:13.673]  Don't want to miss that, starting right now at InfoWars.com.
[01:57:14.254 --> 01:57:16.416]  Cola Blue is just an incredible news sponsor.
[01:57:17.137 --> 01:57:20.478]  And Cola Blue is an atmospheric water generator.
[01:57:20.718 --> 01:57:22.638]  These things are some of the hottest things in the nation.
[01:57:23.018 --> 01:57:24.739]  Atmospheric water generator for the home.
[01:57:25.059 --> 01:57:27.399]  Pays for itself in one year if you buy your water from the store.
[01:57:27.439 --> 01:57:29.460]  Pure, clean water without the fluoride.
[01:57:29.620 --> 01:57:30.500]  Directly from the air.
[01:57:30.580 --> 01:57:31.600]  Seven and a half gallons a day.
[01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:32.700]  About half that in the desert.
[01:57:33.020 --> 01:57:34.261]  Great tasting, pure H2O.
[01:57:34.301 --> 01:57:35.741]  Exactly the way Mother Nature wants it.
[01:57:35.961 --> 01:57:37.001]  With a neutral pH.
[01:57:37.041 --> 01:57:37.921]  No chemicals, pollutants.
[01:57:38.141 --> 01:57:40.282]  It has five filters inside of it.
[01:57:40.822 --> 01:57:42.904]  And at first it takes it out of the air, which is pretty darn clean.
[01:57:42.924 --> 01:57:44.325]  Then it cleans it up in there.
[01:57:44.565 --> 01:57:48.187]  Give them a call or get a free brochure.
[01:57:48.207 --> 01:57:48.708]  866-585-4044.
[01:57:48.748 --> 01:57:49.448]  Amazing System.
[01:57:49.468 --> 01:57:51.109]  1-866-585-4044.
[01:57:51.209 --> 01:57:53.111]  Or coloblue.com.
[01:57:53.471 --> 01:57:57.094]  Big banner up on infowars.com.
[01:57:57.114 --> 01:57:58.034]  866-585-4044.
[01:57:58.054 --> 01:58:02.938]  And then don't forget the best storable foods company in the nation, efoodsdirect.com.
[01:58:03.298 --> 01:58:04.359]  The J. Michael Stevens Group.
[01:58:04.379 --> 01:58:08.522]  Big fat banners at the top of infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:58:09.872 --> 01:58:14.573]  With all the things that are happening in the world today, it is more important to have some storable food than ever.
[01:58:14.633 --> 01:58:15.414]  Get it while you can.
[01:58:15.454 --> 01:58:16.554]  Food prices are exploding.
[01:58:16.574 --> 01:58:16.674]  1-800-409-5633.
[01:58:16.694 --> 01:58:16.874]  1-800-409-5633.
[01:58:16.934 --> 01:58:17.634]  Or eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:58:17.654 --> 01:58:18.235]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:58:18.275 --> 01:58:19.175]  Retransmission starts now.
[01:58:19.195 --> 01:58:19.495]  One place.
[01:58:19.515 --> 01:58:20.075]  Infowars.com.
[01:58:30.236 --> 01:58:30.537]  Yes!
[01:58:31.278 --> 01:58:32.420]  Another excellent transmission.
[01:58:32.440 --> 01:58:33.161]  I want to say bye to everybody.
[01:58:33.201 --> 01:58:33.802]  Hold on one minute.
[01:58:34.423 --> 01:58:36.607]  John, I want to say great job there.
[01:58:36.627 --> 01:58:37.449]  Thank you sir.
[01:58:37.629 --> 01:58:41.035]  And good job for Worsley filling in for the hour.
[01:58:41.055 --> 01:58:41.676]  He did good?
[01:58:41.816 --> 01:58:42.618]  He did excellent.
[01:58:42.978 --> 01:58:43.259]  Good.
[01:58:43.561 --> 01:58:49.583]  He will not be forced to walk the plank into a shark tank of JC Clayton's.
[01:58:50.603 --> 01:58:55.944]  But hey, listen, I really appreciate you and everything you're doing.
[01:58:56.545 --> 01:59:01.566]  And I will see you back live tomorrow, my friend.
[01:59:01.866 --> 01:59:02.366]  Damn right.
[01:59:02.386 --> 01:59:03.207]  We'll see you tomorrow, same time.
[01:59:03.267 --> 01:59:04.508]  Well done.
[01:59:04.948 --> 01:59:05.488]  We'll see you tomorrow.
[01:59:05.528 --> 01:59:05.929]  Take care.
[01:59:05.969 --> 01:59:06.369]  Take care.
[01:59:06.389 --> 01:59:08.991]  To everybody else out there, exciting things are happening.
[01:59:09.211 --> 01:59:11.432]  I've never seen people waking up to the New World Order like they are right now.
[01:59:11.452 --> 01:59:13.073]  A lot of bad stuff's happening too.
[01:59:13.494 --> 01:59:20.338]  But we can certainly use this right now against the New World Order and really expose these dirty bastards for who they are.
[01:59:20.818 --> 01:59:23.981]  As I said, we will be right back with the Congressman.
[01:59:24.841 --> 01:59:29.664]  Burgress, who was on, dealing with martial law, and a whole other group of things.
[01:59:29.704 --> 01:59:32.726]  And I'll tell you about some of the special guests that are coming up Wednesday.
[01:59:33.127 --> 01:59:38.730]  All of that right now as we go back into retransmission in about the next 30 seconds.
[01:59:38.750 --> 01:59:42.333]  In fact, you don't want to hear the ad, so I'll just keep talking for 30 seconds.
[01:59:43.013 --> 01:59:43.794]  I can't help it, folks.
[01:59:43.834 --> 01:59:47.756]  I'm so mission-oriented that when good things happen, I just get excited.
[01:59:47.836 --> 01:59:49.918]  It's like my team just won the Super Bowl.
[01:59:50.618 --> 01:59:53.579]  There's not a bunch of steroid head, arrogant gang members.
[01:59:54.059 --> 01:59:54.939]  You know, like in sports.
[01:59:55.080 --> 01:59:57.020]  It's the American people just want a big victory.
[01:59:57.360 --> 01:59:59.721]  And I'm totally dedicated to this fight against the New World Order.
[01:59:59.961 --> 02:00:00.961]  We can beat them.
[02:00:01.222 --> 02:00:02.222]  We can expose them.
[02:00:02.242 --> 02:00:04.002]  But you have to take action.
[02:00:04.063 --> 02:00:06.223]  That's what causes it all to happen.
[02:00:06.823 --> 02:00:07.984]  And so it is up to you.
[02:00:08.664 --> 02:00:14.271]  All right, I figure now's a good time to go back into retransmission at InfoWars.com.
[02:00:14.291 --> 02:00:18.015]  We'll be back for everybody else in 22 hours from now.
[02:00:18.055 --> 02:00:22.139]  No, that's 20 hours from now at InfoWars.com and on the AM and FM dial.
[02:00:22.179 --> 02:00:22.900]  But for everybody else,
[02:00:23.641 --> 02:00:24.302]  God bless you all.
[02:00:24.322 --> 02:00:29.265]  Don't forget the new podcast and we are about to have free archives going back two years of all the shows as well.
[02:00:29.646 --> 02:00:32.088]  Big Mouth now signs off with a big victory for Liberty.
[02:00:32.348 --> 02:00:37.492]  Now they'll probably stage a depression and blame it all on us, but we'll expose the terrorists again and their financial terrorism.
[02:00:37.732 --> 02:00:38.793]  Goodbye and good luck.
