[00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:53.128]  Psoriasis.
[00:00:53.308 --> 00:00:58.510]  The itching, flaking, and irritation is painful, but the emotional suffering can be even more devastating.
[00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:59.691]  My body was so sore.
[00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:00.931]  My mind was so worn out.
[00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:02.072]  I could not sleep at night.
[00:01:02.272 --> 00:01:03.272]  I felt self-conscious.
[00:01:03.312 --> 00:01:04.753]  Nobody knows what that flaking is.
[00:01:04.793 --> 00:01:07.214]  And people say, ew, it just made me feel like you're dirty.
[00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:08.274]  I don't want people knowing I have this.
[00:01:08.294 --> 00:01:08.715]  It's embarrassing.
[00:01:08.775 --> 00:01:10.175]  Of course I felt self-conscious.
[00:01:10.235 --> 00:01:11.556]  Not very attractive to look at.

[00:02:13.793 --> 00:02:19.118]  And it is setting a bold example for other former communist nations that desire to live in peace and freedom.
[00:02:19.438 --> 00:02:25.664]  The president says two of those countries are Croatia and Albania, which have been invited to join the alliance.
[00:02:25.964 --> 00:02:33.371]  The president says Europe is now into a promising new era of peace after the wars and the communist oppression of the 20th century.

[00:03:33.186 --> 00:03:41.429]  Bishop Carlos Aguirre says drug traffickers pour money into building roads or churches and providing electricity service.
[00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:46.310]  He says the drug smugglers quote, bill things that mean a lot for the communities.
[00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.493]  He adds the church is trying to get gangsters to leave the drug smuggling trade.
[00:03:51.873 --> 00:04:00.057]  An estimated two and a half thousand people died in Mexico last year in the war between drug lords and controlling smuggling routes to the United States.

[00:06:18.758 --> 00:06:30.003]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[00:06:30.083 --> 00:06:31.484]  I have 25 words for you.
[00:06:32.164 --> 00:06:34.225]  From my cold, dead hand,
[00:06:38.932 --> 00:06:45.178]  I've always been a big fan of Charlton Heston.
[00:06:45.338 --> 00:06:54.206]  Ever since I was a little kid, my mom in Dallas took me in to see the Ten Commandments on the big screen and then
[00:07:06.814 --> 00:07:08.814]  Every, about once a year, Ben Hur would come to town.
[00:07:08.834 --> 00:07:09.935]  She took me once to see that.
[00:07:10.955 --> 00:07:17.336]  And Soylent Green, Omega Man, which they just remade into I Am Legend with Will Smith.
[00:07:17.356 --> 00:07:20.637]  That's the original name of the novel that they first made into Omega Man.
[00:07:20.657 --> 00:07:26.838]  And of course, I've interviewed Charlton Heston and talked to him at several events.
[00:07:26.898 --> 00:07:30.399]  Had a chance to meet him a few times after that in person.
[00:07:31.339 --> 00:07:35.840]  And last night, when I found out he died, I'd gone into the office to
[00:07:36.718 --> 00:07:38.338]  Do some work on a film I'm making.
[00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:54.123]  And it was midnight, and I got in the car and was driving home right at midnight and tuned in to KLBJ 590 AM, the station that we do this Sunday syndicated show out of, where we originate the show out of, and I heard them talking about an 84-year-old actor who died.
[00:07:54.163 --> 00:07:59.364]  I'd missed the first part of the announcement on Fox News, and I just knew it was Charlton Heston because I knew his age.
[00:08:00.025 --> 00:08:04.826]  And then they went into the rolls and repeated that Charlton Heston had died.
[00:08:05.768 --> 00:08:06.989]  At 84 years of age.
[00:08:07.449 --> 00:08:18.976]  So today I'm going to re-air part of an interview I did with Mr. Heston, now deceased, seven years ago, or January 18, 2000.
[00:08:20.237 --> 00:08:23.639]  Now last night I got home about 12.30.
[00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:28.361]  I started googling and searching on my own website, going back seven years, and guess what?
[00:08:28.401 --> 00:08:31.003]  The MP3 link was dead.
[00:08:31.683 --> 00:08:34.385]  I looked all over the web until about 2 a.m., couldn't find it.
[00:08:35.365 --> 00:08:47.329]  I went into the office this afternoon, tore the office apart, and found a copy of it on CD that somebody recorded off of an AM radio station, and that they had copied and mailed to me.
[00:08:48.189 --> 00:08:50.630]  So it's not the best audio quality, but this is it!
[00:08:50.970 --> 00:09:00.194]  I was real mad, folks, that I couldn't find my Charlton Heston interview, but we were able to find it sometime during the weekday show.
[00:09:00.234 --> 00:09:01.254]  It's about a 20-minute interview.
[00:09:02.442 --> 00:09:23.000]  I will air the whole thing sometime this week on the three-hour weekday show, but I'm going to air about five minutes of it today, just like I'm going to air about five minutes of the Jesse Ventura interview that I did Wednesday that made it in the Associated Press, the Dallas Morning News, the Pioneer Press, international television, national television.
[00:09:24.501 --> 00:09:30.246]  We interviewed Governor Ventura and he said a lot of, well, really controversial statements
[00:09:31.445 --> 00:09:39.947]  He talked about how NBC really hired him to block him from having free speech and keeping him, when he left the governorship in 2003, from being able to speak out against the war.
[00:09:40.267 --> 00:09:45.708]  They wouldn't let him speak out against the war, and they wouldn't let him get on any other media or TV via his contract.
[00:09:46.328 --> 00:09:54.210]  He talked about how he believes that criminal elements of the government will assassinate Barack Obama if he truly becomes the president and tries to pull troops out of Iraq.
[00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:59.331]  But the big one was, former Governor Jesse Ventura, World Trade Center collapse, a controlled demolition.
[00:09:59.713 --> 00:10:01.614]  An inside job, the government carried it out.
[00:10:02.474 --> 00:10:10.958]  Associated Press, Ventura says he regrets initial acceptance of 9-11 explanations, and he said that on the syndicated radio show of Alex Jones.
[00:10:11.418 --> 00:10:16.640]  So, we'll be playing some of that today, as well, and taking your phone calls.
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:23.963]  But in the last half of the show today, I'm going to play, I don't know, eight, nine minutes, or about half the interview I had with Charlton Heston.
[00:10:25.103 --> 00:10:28.385]  And I know this, Chuck retired about a year and a half later,
[00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:36.863]  Sharp as a tack when I interviewed him, Chuck Heston, and I never bugged him again even though I had his home phone number and never tried to get him back on.
[00:10:37.783 --> 00:10:43.825]  Well, Willie Nelson called up and wanted to come on the show and talk about 9-11 being an inside job.
[00:10:44.666 --> 00:10:47.667]  And let me tell you something, I am not going to not call Willie Nelson now.
[00:10:48.127 --> 00:10:50.188]  I've had Willie Nelson's phone number for two, three months.
[00:10:50.988 --> 00:10:53.729]  I haven't ever bugged him or called him on it after I had him on the show.
[00:10:54.229 --> 00:10:54.789]  But you know what?
[00:10:54.829 --> 00:10:55.510]  I am going to bug him.
[00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:56.290]  I'm going to get to know him.
[00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:57.410]  He invited me to get to know him.
[00:10:57.711 --> 00:10:58.611]  I'm going to get to know
[00:10:59.531 --> 00:11:01.612]  These people, because I'm tired of them dying.
[00:11:01.652 --> 00:11:02.812]  I'm tired of them being gone.
[00:11:07.193 --> 00:11:07.893]  Just amazing.
[00:11:09.393 --> 00:11:15.135]  I know a lot of other big Hollywood people who have actually contacted me before, and I'll talk to them and never call them again.
[00:11:17.455 --> 00:11:18.096]  Well, that's over.
[00:11:18.156 --> 00:11:19.576]  I'm going to start calling Keanu Reeves.
[00:11:20.176 --> 00:11:22.417]  And I'm going to start calling Bruce Willis.
[00:11:22.457 --> 00:11:26.218]  And I'm going to start calling and bugging Rick Linklater here in Austin.
[00:11:27.158 --> 00:11:27.538]  Because...
[00:11:28.274 --> 00:11:32.656]  The craziest thing is I've been invited out to eat with people, or invited out to Los Angeles, and I just don't do it!
[00:11:33.436 --> 00:11:42.220]  I'm so busy fighting the New World Order, so busy doing radio, and I just regret that I didn't at least call Chuck Heston back, Charlton Heston, and get him on a few more times before he retired.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:46.342]  Because this living legend, this icon, this humanitarian, is gone.
[00:11:47.662 --> 00:11:48.123]  He's gone.
[00:11:48.183 --> 00:11:49.483]  I can't ever talk to him again.
[00:11:50.063 --> 00:11:51.584]  We'll never get to see another interview with him.
[00:11:51.604 --> 00:11:52.945]  We'll never get to see anything new from him.
[00:11:53.245 --> 00:11:53.725]  He's gone.
[00:11:55.646 --> 00:11:58.066]  I do have some comments, too, about Heston's family.
[00:11:58.807 --> 00:11:59.947]  Just some observations.
[00:11:59.967 --> 00:12:05.108]  I'm going to try to be nice about this, but I've got some comments coming up near the end of the show today as well.
[00:12:06.628 --> 00:12:08.048]  But Chuck Heston.
[00:12:09.449 --> 00:12:12.249]  I mean, he's just one of my favorite actors, and such a gentleman.
[00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:13.670]  Okay.
[00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:18.251]  What is the other news I have in front of me here?
[00:12:20.811 --> 00:12:23.652]  Vodka maker Absolute apologizes.
[00:12:23.892 --> 00:12:25.452]  Ends ad show in California.
[00:12:25.905 --> 00:12:27.406]  Texas is part of Mexico.
[00:12:28.848 --> 00:12:30.649]  That's out of the Associated Press today.
[00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:40.718]  Friday this broke, and I'm so conditioned to all of the Larry Conquista talk, the reconquering of the Southwest, that I didn't even cover it on my show.
[00:12:40.978 --> 00:12:45.682]  Kurt Nimmo posted it, posted the absolute ad Monday morning, I mean Friday morning.
[00:12:46.663 --> 00:12:49.345]  I went on the air for three hours and didn't even talk about it.
[00:12:50.085 --> 00:12:53.148]  This is so old hat to me that I didn't even talk about it.
[00:12:53.775 --> 00:13:01.961]  Since then, it's been all over the news, a huge issue, Washington Post, LA Times, TV News, huge boycotts, people freaking out.
[00:13:03.522 --> 00:13:08.845]  I forget, just because I knew about this 15 years ago, doesn't mean the general public knows about it today.
[00:13:08.865 --> 00:13:10.707]  I have to remember we have to reintroduce all this.
[00:13:12.448 --> 00:13:21.174]  And it is true that in polls, more than 80% of Hispanics from Mexico do not consider themselves to be American, and they actually
[00:13:21.792 --> 00:13:24.814]  No, this is not Mexican-Americans or folks that are here in this country and love this country.
[00:13:25.174 --> 00:13:25.954]  It's the immigrants.
[00:13:26.835 --> 00:13:29.056]  They don't just not like the U.S.
[00:13:29.176 --> 00:13:32.418]  It is a cultural, wild hatred.
[00:13:33.739 --> 00:13:34.980]  And go read the L.A.
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:35.720]  Times comments.
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.222]  There's more than 500 of them last time I checked.
[00:13:39.162 --> 00:13:40.843]  And it's, we're going to kill you.
[00:13:40.943 --> 00:13:42.004]  Yes, we're taking over.
[00:13:42.084 --> 00:13:43.124]  You will all be killed.
[00:13:44.645 --> 00:13:47.147]  And I'm like, I'm not supposed to talk about this.
[00:13:47.167 --> 00:13:50.929]  I'm supposed to just play along with this and act like this isn't going on.
[00:13:51.821 --> 00:13:55.062]  Absolute Vodka understood that this is the market.
[00:13:56.262 --> 00:14:12.186]  And so in Spanish publications in the U.S., Spanish language, and in the Mexican TV and Mexican newspapers and magazines, they advertise Colorado, Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma.
[00:14:13.746 --> 00:14:15.206]  It isn't just Texas and Mexico.
[00:14:16.507 --> 00:14:17.867]  It is about half the country.
[00:14:20.137 --> 00:14:21.858]  And this is taught in U.S.
[00:14:21.918 --> 00:14:22.659]  public schools.
[00:14:22.759 --> 00:14:23.940]  It is taught in the colleges.
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:24.980]  It is taught in Mexico.
[00:14:25.541 --> 00:14:26.862]  Our government is globalist.
[00:14:26.882 --> 00:14:27.982]  They want to break the U.S.
[00:14:28.102 --> 00:14:28.182]  up.
[00:14:28.823 --> 00:14:31.224]  They want us divided and conquered and fighting with each other.
[00:14:32.465 --> 00:14:48.936]  And our government for 50 years, the criminals running it, have been financing, the Ford Foundation has spent more than $20 billion of its hundreds of billions, its hundreds of billions, ladies and gentlemen, to go down to Mexico and pay for the textbooks, the comic books,
[00:14:49.838 --> 00:14:50.218]  All of it.
[00:14:50.338 --> 00:14:51.299]  I mean, I own all these.
[00:14:52.639 --> 00:14:54.920]  Where they say they're going to take over the U.S.
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:56.961]  and that all whites will be murdered.
[00:14:57.782 --> 00:14:59.102]  Now, I know you don't believe this.
[00:14:59.142 --> 00:14:59.962]  See, it's perfect.
[00:15:00.243 --> 00:15:04.665]  It's like teenagers talking code and text messaging code and parents don't understand it.
[00:15:05.305 --> 00:15:07.906]  And I still haven't figured out half of it and I'm a computer head.
[00:15:08.325 --> 00:15:09.546]  I just don't text message a lot.
[00:15:09.846 --> 00:15:11.447]  It's the same thing with the illegal aliens.
[00:15:11.527 --> 00:15:12.968]  I mean, it's the radios.
[00:15:13.008 --> 00:15:13.929]  We're gonna kill you.
[00:15:14.049 --> 00:15:14.749]  Get the guns.
[00:15:14.809 --> 00:15:15.490]  Get the weapons.
[00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:16.690]  We're gonna kill gringo.
[00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:17.471]  Get ready.
[00:15:17.511 --> 00:15:18.011]  Move in.
[00:15:18.091 --> 00:15:18.652]  Take over.
[00:15:18.672 --> 00:15:19.532]  Don't hire them.
[00:15:19.572 --> 00:15:21.133]  Get in positions to fire all of them.
[00:15:21.353 --> 00:15:22.514]  Drive them out of America.
[00:15:22.774 --> 00:15:24.615]  The killing of the gringo will soon start.
[00:15:24.655 --> 00:15:26.216]  The mass murder will soon begin.
[00:15:26.236 --> 00:15:27.297]  Death, death, death.
[00:15:28.358 --> 00:15:35.422]  But see, the gringos and the blacks and Hispanics that have been, you know, in the melting pot, they're not speaking Spanish.
[00:15:35.442 --> 00:15:36.102]  They're not here.
[00:15:36.123 --> 00:15:36.803]  They're not tuned in.
[00:15:37.284 --> 00:15:38.545]  Perfect way to take over.
[00:15:39.065 --> 00:15:45.148]  Gonna let you know just how serious it is, and how there's a mass of people preparing to slaughter you and your family, and they have already attacked.
[00:15:45.168 --> 00:15:45.768]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:45.788 --> 00:15:47.189]  It is a big idea.
[00:15:47.309 --> 00:15:48.610]  A new world order.
[00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:49.810]  In the near future.
[00:15:59.491 --> 00:16:01.873]  Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:16:02.574 --> 00:16:04.696]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:16:05.396 --> 00:16:07.618]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:16:08.179 --> 00:16:10.621]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:16:11.361 --> 00:16:18.668]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:16:21.707 --> 00:16:26.670]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:16:27.151 --> 00:16:30.613]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:16:31.013 --> 00:16:33.475]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:16:33.595 --> 00:16:34.556]  Most people have no idea.
[00:16:34.576 --> 00:16:35.516]  They're not after money.
[00:16:35.536 --> 00:16:36.617]  They have all the money they need.
[00:16:36.837 --> 00:16:37.538]  They're after power.
[00:16:37.578 --> 00:16:38.498]  That's what they're after these years.

[00:16:47.684 --> 00:16:50.446]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:16:50.466 --> 00:16:51.507]  You have been warned.
[00:16:52.168 --> 00:16:53.149]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:16:53.229 --> 00:16:58.034]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:16:58.174 --> 00:17:05.983]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:17:06.243 --> 00:17:11.589]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:17:11.809 --> 00:17:18.813]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:17:19.094 --> 00:17:24.417]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:17:24.697 --> 00:17:29.420]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:37.345]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:17:37.685 --> 00:17:43.928]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:17:44.248 --> 00:17:45.448]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:17:45.468 --> 00:17:45.709]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:17:52.944 --> 00:17:55.987]  Hi neighbor, this is Steve Schenck, Fearless Task Force.
[00:17:56.588 --> 00:17:59.170]  Life is a gamble, but you can stack the deck.
[00:18:00.111 --> 00:18:09.360]  If you knew what I know about all the problems food will protect you from, you'd start immediately to put every effort and dollar you can get into the biggest supply of food possible.
[00:18:10.061 --> 00:18:15.286]  When the dollar and economy crash, when the imported and genetically poisoned food is all that's left,
[00:18:15.946 --> 00:18:24.233]  When the quarantine and bird flu hit, our only protection and only chance to be fearless is having control of our own supply of food and enough of it.
[00:18:24.493 --> 00:18:32.179]  But if you knew what we haven't yet discovered, you wouldn't waste time listening to the rest of this announcement before charging out and getting a serious food supply.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.542]  Decide, it's food now or probably never.
[00:18:35.942 --> 00:18:37.224]  But can you afford to be wrong?
[00:18:37.904 --> 00:18:38.585]  Decide now.
[00:18:39.086 --> 00:18:39.867]  Place your bet.
[00:18:40.648 --> 00:18:42.110]  Can you afford to be wrong?
[00:18:42.491 --> 00:18:43.893]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[00:18:43.913 --> 00:18:44.073]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:18:53.464 --> 00:18:56.847]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:18:56.987 --> 00:19:02.212]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:19:02.392 --> 00:19:07.177]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:19:07.557 --> 00:19:18.668]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:19:19.068 --> 00:19:24.611]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons, or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:19:24.831 --> 00:19:30.915]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:19:31.095 --> 00:19:31.755]  What about you?
[00:19:32.135 --> 00:19:36.738]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for our special price of only $39.99, with free shipping.

[00:19:44.545 --> 00:19:47.948]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.121]  Let me explain something, everybody.
[00:20:13.181 --> 00:20:16.662]  It is painful for me to have to cover this and have to tell you this.
[00:20:18.303 --> 00:20:22.745]  And what happens is, is I mean to mediate my words.
[00:20:23.725 --> 00:20:26.646]  But when I get on air, all I want to do is tell you the truth.
[00:20:27.587 --> 00:20:28.747]  And I can't control myself.
[00:20:28.807 --> 00:20:30.948]  So I just laid out the truth to you in the last segment.
[00:20:31.568 --> 00:20:32.629]  I know it sounds radical.
[00:20:32.649 --> 00:20:33.409]  I know it's scary.
[00:20:33.429 --> 00:20:34.269]  I know it's crazy.
[00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:38.611]  It's also divisive and painful.
[00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:46.434]  I'm not the one selling, at shops all over Austin, Plan of San Diego shirts.
[00:20:47.234 --> 00:20:55.239]  If you Google Plan of San Diego, you'll be at the University of Texas website, you'll be at the University of Mexico at Mexico City's website.
[00:20:55.820 --> 00:21:06.646]  It was the German-slash-Mexican plan during World War I to attack the Southwest from Texas to California and to kill all whites 16 and older.
[00:21:07.987 --> 00:21:10.948]  And then forced the other whites to leave.
[00:21:12.408 --> 00:21:16.448]  It also said that if blacks didn't swear allegiance to Mexico, they would be killed.
[00:21:17.049 --> 00:21:23.170]  Now, under German command, Mexico did attack California, Arizona, and Texas.
[00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:27.070]  In one night, 23 Americans were killed.
[00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:36.552]  And the Mexicans went in, in South Texas, into homes, killed whole families, two-year-old children, slit their throats ear to ear,
[00:21:37.473 --> 00:21:38.854]  Under German command, of course.
[00:21:39.775 --> 00:21:43.278]  Now, they don't want you to know about that, but you can find out about that real quick.
[00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:51.625]  We're these chicken-necked, yuppie Americans who are weak and pathetic and dumbed down and think we're free when we're not.
[00:21:52.506 --> 00:21:54.667]  And so we have no idea what's going on.
[00:21:55.208 --> 00:21:56.649]  You ever heard the Marine Corps anthem?
[00:21:56.869 --> 00:22:06.257]  From the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli, we will fight this country's battles
[00:22:06.783 --> 00:22:07.703]  You understand that song?
[00:22:08.584 --> 00:22:09.864]  The few, the proud, the Marines?
[00:22:10.424 --> 00:22:17.206]  The Marines' first big victory, after they were incorporated into the Navy properly and expanded, was led by Ulysses S. Grant.
[00:22:17.747 --> 00:22:21.488]  He's the guy, I remember, became the head of the Northern Military during the Civil War.
[00:22:22.108 --> 00:22:28.810]  But as a young man, he led the Marines to fight a force of about four to one, battling all the way down into Mexico.
[00:22:29.791 --> 00:22:31.251]  Then the Mexicans asked the U.S.
[00:22:31.271 --> 00:22:32.792]  to take over, and the U.S.
[00:22:32.832 --> 00:22:34.032]  said, no, we're not going to do that.
[00:22:34.844 --> 00:22:41.828]  We're going to pay you $10 million for land that you took from Spain when you overthrew them 20-something years before.
[00:22:42.348 --> 00:22:43.189]  Let's get this clear.
[00:22:43.869 --> 00:22:47.211]  If the Southwest belongs to anybody, it's the Native American tribes.
[00:22:47.391 --> 00:22:49.252]  But they all fought with each other constantly.
[00:22:50.953 --> 00:22:51.913]  Spain fell.
[00:22:52.213 --> 00:22:53.554]  Santa Ana came in.
[00:22:53.714 --> 00:23:04.300]  Santa Ana then, Spain had invited the Tennesseans, Alabamans, and others into Texas because they couldn't kick the Comanche, the Apache, the Red Sticks,
[00:23:05.035 --> 00:23:06.296]  Baton Rouge in French.
[00:23:06.316 --> 00:23:07.677]  That's why you call it Baton Rouge.
[00:23:07.737 --> 00:23:08.858]  It was where the Red Sticks were based.
[00:23:08.878 --> 00:23:10.739]  It means Red Bat, Red Stick.
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.422]  That was one of the main tribes in the eastern part of the state.
[00:23:14.542 --> 00:23:15.122]  Very tough.
[00:23:16.083 --> 00:23:22.908]  And it's not like the movies set in the 1880s, where, you know, it's John Wayne, he's riding down the last few Indians, the Native Americans.
[00:23:23.188 --> 00:23:33.516]  This was like huge battles where whole towns would be wiped out, and there'd be 20,000 Indians against, you know, 8,000 Americans, and Andrew Jackson in the riding.
[00:23:33.556 --> 00:23:33.816]  This was
[00:23:34.366 --> 00:23:35.387]  This was toe-to-toe.
[00:23:35.447 --> 00:23:41.151]  This was just endless warfare from what's Illinois today down to Texas.
[00:23:42.352 --> 00:23:48.597]  This is when the battles were at each other's throats and the natives were getting the upper hand most of the time.
[00:23:51.119 --> 00:23:52.840]  Spain could do nothing.
[00:23:53.221 --> 00:23:56.083]  I mean, the warlike Anglo-Saxons could barely beat the Indians.
[00:23:56.463 --> 00:23:57.884]  The Spanish had no chance.
[00:23:57.904 --> 00:23:59.466]  They were being wiped out everywhere.
[00:23:59.726 --> 00:24:01.367]  There were less than 5,000 Spanish citizens
[00:24:03.137 --> 00:24:10.482]  From Texas, Oklahoma, all the way over through Colorado, all the way over through Arizona, all the way through Nevada into California and Oregon.
[00:24:10.822 --> 00:24:13.184]  And the Russians were up in Washington State and Oregon.
[00:24:13.204 --> 00:24:13.724]  They had that.
[00:24:13.744 --> 00:24:14.585]  It doesn't matter.
[00:24:14.625 --> 00:24:17.386]  The La Reconquistas are claiming all of that.
[00:24:17.426 --> 00:24:19.428]  It means the reconquering of the Southwest.
[00:24:19.448 --> 00:24:20.688]  And it's taught in Mexico.
[00:24:21.569 --> 00:24:22.189]  So it's true.
[00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:28.293]  For about 19 and a half years, Mexico had the Southwest and couldn't hold any of it.
[00:24:29.834 --> 00:24:32.096]  Then Mexico came into Oklahoma.
[00:24:33.328 --> 00:24:35.969]  And attacked a bunch of people, and killed a bunch of people.
[00:24:36.009 --> 00:24:38.710]  There was a group of scouts, what was it, like 19 of them?
[00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:42.551]  And more than a thousand Mexican troops just slaughtered them, killed every one of them.
[00:24:43.551 --> 00:24:45.272]  And then the Mexico kept attacking them.
[00:24:45.312 --> 00:24:46.892]  Mexico was attacking the U.S.
[00:24:47.772 --> 00:24:53.394]  And so the Marines came down and just absolutely cleaned Mexico's clock.
[00:24:53.934 --> 00:24:55.375]  They had a bunch of Irish with them.
[00:24:55.735 --> 00:25:02.417]  You'll wonder why the La Rican Quiches like to wear, you'll see it, green and clovers.
[00:25:03.531 --> 00:25:08.593]  And that's saying, and you can ask them, that's saying, well, you know, we like the Irish.
[00:25:08.673 --> 00:25:12.474]  They helped us, you know, fight the Americans.
[00:25:12.534 --> 00:25:13.274]  We're not racist.
[00:25:13.734 --> 00:25:15.215]  We just want to kill Americans.
[00:25:17.735 --> 00:25:23.677]  Had a whole bunch of Catholic Irish down there that also got their hind ends kicked when the Marines came in.
[00:25:24.477 --> 00:25:25.098]  And I'm sorry.
[00:25:25.318 --> 00:25:28.439]  I mean, you know, I'm sorry the Marines could fight 4 to 1, 5 to 1.
[00:25:28.759 --> 00:25:29.259]  I'm sorry.
[00:25:29.879 --> 00:25:33.020]  I mean, you know, Mexico is a narco-terrorist state.
[00:25:33.433 --> 00:25:34.573]  It is totally corrupt.
[00:25:36.294 --> 00:25:42.035]  It has more billionaires than any other nation on earth per capita, but the people are some of the poorest in the world.
[00:25:43.255 --> 00:25:45.876]  The Mexican people are smart, hard-working, inventive.
[00:25:46.976 --> 00:25:52.678]  They have been downtrodden since the Aztecs enslaved them, and then that merged with the conquistadors.
[00:25:53.458 --> 00:25:57.039]  And so this hatred of the United States... I'm a true patriot.
[00:25:57.119 --> 00:25:58.119]  I love the United States.
[00:25:59.079 --> 00:26:01.880]  Okay, my family was in the battles of San Jacinto.
[00:26:02.446 --> 00:26:07.530]  My family, on both sides, my mother's family raised Colonel Travis's son.
[00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:09.572]  His last letter from the Alamo was to them.
[00:26:11.093 --> 00:26:15.517]  You understand, folks, my family has Spanish land grants on my dad's side.
[00:26:16.517 --> 00:26:20.901]  On my mother's side, German immigrants, Alsatian immigrants that came here in the 1830s and 40s.
[00:26:21.661 --> 00:26:25.785]  As Texas as it gets, and I just cannot stand by for this anymore.
[00:26:26.745 --> 00:26:31.009]  It makes me sick, and I really, it's a terrible thing because
[00:26:32.967 --> 00:26:34.448]  Because I want to get along with everybody.
[00:26:34.548 --> 00:26:35.428]  I want to be friendly.
[00:26:35.949 --> 00:26:36.729]  I want to be nice.
[00:26:36.849 --> 00:26:39.431]  You know, I was talking to a group of La Reconquistas a few years ago.
[00:26:39.451 --> 00:26:41.992]  They were going to have a big parade celebrating the takeover of the U.S.
[00:26:42.573 --> 00:26:46.815]  And I called the head of it up here in Austin, and I said, man, I said, listen, I got a lot of Hispanic friends.
[00:26:46.875 --> 00:26:48.957]  I said, but this is aggressive towards the U.S.
[00:26:49.397 --> 00:26:52.559]  And he said, oh, the racist gringo, you like some of us.
[00:26:52.599 --> 00:26:54.240]  And I said, no, man, I really don't care.
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:55.781]  I said, you're the one that's the racist.
[00:26:55.841 --> 00:26:56.661]  And he used that term.
[00:26:57.181 --> 00:26:58.082]  And I said, I'll be down there.
[00:26:58.102 --> 00:26:59.083]  And he said, you don't dare.
[00:26:59.123 --> 00:26:59.903]  We'll kick your butt.
[00:26:59.923 --> 00:27:00.804]  And I said, OK, I'm going to be there.
[00:27:01.044 --> 00:27:01.544]  And I was there.
[00:27:02.714 --> 00:27:08.597]  And you know, that's the sad part about this, is that we got the New World Order hurting all of us.
[00:27:08.617 --> 00:27:10.798]  We got the New World Order putting fluoride in all of our water.
[00:27:11.379 --> 00:27:14.100]  We have the New World Order that's putting mercury in all our vaccines.
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:17.302]  We have the New World Order that's destroying the dollar, just like they destroyed the peso.
[00:27:17.942 --> 00:27:27.848]  We have the New World Order that is hurting... I mean, I say take Planned Parenthood, the eugenics front, for exterminating little black and brown babies out of your neighborhood.
[00:27:28.028 --> 00:27:30.929]  Do you see your Mexican or black leaders saying, get those out of your neighborhood?
[00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:31.950]  No.
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:38.284]  Do you know that was set up even before Hitler and that Hitler was buddies with Margaret Sanger, who set up Planned Parenthood?
[00:27:38.464 --> 00:27:40.826]  You know, I actually want you to live well.
[00:27:40.886 --> 00:27:42.467]  I actually want you to have good jobs.
[00:27:42.567 --> 00:27:46.530]  I actually want everybody to be happy and have fun.
[00:27:48.051 --> 00:27:50.593]  But, you know, my uncle lived in Guatemala for many years.
[00:27:50.673 --> 00:27:51.373]  My cousins did.
[00:27:51.413 --> 00:27:52.234]  They speak Spanish.
[00:27:52.955 --> 00:28:01.441]  I remember my cousin 15 years ago going, yeah, you know, I speak Spanish, but I'm a white guy, so I get to hear about how the gringos are bad and how we're going to get it and how we're going to get killed.
[00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:04.491]  And, you know, that's the problem.
[00:28:04.531 --> 00:28:14.615]  Every time you talk about the little secret that I'd have to say more than half the folks that, you know, say that they're from Mexico are four.
[00:28:15.195 --> 00:28:19.797]  It's like, oh, you shouldn't say that we write books saying we're going to kill you when our numbers are high enough.
[00:28:20.597 --> 00:28:21.237]  That's racist.
[00:28:21.297 --> 00:28:22.678]  I'm going, but you say you want to kill me.
[00:28:25.339 --> 00:28:27.139]  I'm going to finish up on this because this is important.
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.100]  I'm going to read you some of the quotes out of the L.A.
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:30.801]  Times about, we are going to kill you.
[00:28:32.347 --> 00:28:37.611]  Again, absolute vodka in an absolute world says that half the U.S.
[00:28:37.631 --> 00:28:38.631]  will go back to Mexico.
[00:28:38.651 --> 00:28:39.732]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:53.112 --> 00:28:54.573]  America needs Ron Paul.
[00:28:54.793 --> 00:28:55.834]  He needs your support.
[00:28:56.074 --> 00:28:57.075]  The time is now.
[00:28:57.455 --> 00:29:01.338]  As long as he has your support, he will continue to fight until the very end.
[00:29:01.678 --> 00:29:05.761]  We know that many people would like to show their support, but want to do it on a larger scale.

[00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:00.250]  Hemp.
[00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:03.430]  Used for food, clothing, and shelter since time began.
[00:30:03.791 --> 00:30:04.071]  Hemp.
[00:30:04.411 --> 00:30:10.852]  This God-given food source is controlled by your government, making it not legal to grow for American people and farmers, but legal to import.
[00:30:11.232 --> 00:30:14.474]  Our Founding Fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.

[00:30:55.387 --> 00:30:58.810]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:00.852]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:31:01.473 --> 00:31:04.235]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:31:04.536 --> 00:31:10.041]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.

[00:32:57.822 --> 00:33:00.985]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today!
[00:33:12.688 --> 00:33:25.358]  What's happened is Absolute Vodka is running print ads and TV ads in Mexico that show half the United States that originally belonged to Spain just because they
[00:33:41.684 --> 00:33:42.684]  Said they had it.
[00:33:43.044 --> 00:33:45.345]  They didn't have anybody on it and couldn't keep it.
[00:33:49.146 --> 00:33:57.368]  All Absolute Vodka, the Swedish vodka company, was doing was playing to something that their marketing studies had shown.
[00:33:57.428 --> 00:34:03.529]  In fact, the PR firm that's now in deep trouble and apologizing that was hired by Absolute is apologizing.
[00:34:04.409 --> 00:34:05.850]  And see, that's the big dirty secret.
[00:34:09.113 --> 00:34:10.274]  And my wife grew up in Spain.
[00:34:10.314 --> 00:34:14.237]  She lived there four years, Italy six years, so she speaks fluent Spanish.
[00:34:15.018 --> 00:34:17.419]  And she'll freak out listening to the Spanish radio station.
[00:34:17.439 --> 00:34:19.841]  She'll freak out at signs as we drive down the road.
[00:34:20.602 --> 00:34:25.345]  She'll freak out, and I told her about this ten years ago, and she didn't believe me, and now she sees it everywhere.
[00:34:26.506 --> 00:34:32.371]  And we'll be in restaurants, and people will say stuff, and it's perfect, because
[00:34:34.591 --> 00:34:41.813]  You've got the chicken-necked, liberal, guilty... Let me roll a red carpet out for everybody.
[00:34:41.833 --> 00:34:42.733]  Let me feel sorry.
[00:34:42.773 --> 00:34:43.934]  Let me not say anything.
[00:34:45.154 --> 00:34:46.275]  Let me just feel guilty.
[00:34:46.315 --> 00:34:47.775]  I'm an evil, white devil.
[00:34:48.275 --> 00:34:49.936]  I'm the worst thing on earth.
[00:34:50.736 --> 00:34:51.976]  And oh, yes.
[00:34:52.977 --> 00:34:56.558]  Let the illegal aliens be able to have free health care, but citizens don't get it.
[00:34:56.578 --> 00:34:57.478]  Did you know they get that?
[00:34:57.538 --> 00:35:00.519]  Or let the illegal aliens get free tuition that citizens don't get.
[00:35:00.579 --> 00:35:04.280]  Or let them not get arrested for DWIs or not having a driver's license.
[00:35:04.713 --> 00:35:05.434]  That's all admitted.
[00:35:08.816 --> 00:35:20.203]  It's just anything, because we love you and we're bad and we're... And then meanwhile, it's... On one end, well, Gringo needs to be, you know, have all the land taken, and ha-ha, Gringo's dying.
[00:35:20.223 --> 00:35:21.444]  I can play you hundreds of these clips.
[00:35:21.664 --> 00:35:22.564]  The mayor of L.A.
[00:35:22.604 --> 00:35:23.185]  says this stuff.
[00:35:23.865 --> 00:35:25.446]  Back when he was just a city council member.
[00:35:26.167 --> 00:35:28.888]  And, uh, all the white people are gonna die, ha-ha.
[00:35:29.409 --> 00:35:33.131]  You know, you're a scum, the blacks are maillotas, which means blackbird.
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:36.561]  All this racist stuff and Native American Indians.
[00:35:36.741 --> 00:35:38.822]  They have all these horrible names for them.
[00:35:39.303 --> 00:35:41.504]  I mean, just so much racist terms.
[00:35:42.784 --> 00:35:48.547]  And by they, I'm talking about public officials, members of the legislature in California, the mayor.
[00:35:49.047 --> 00:35:52.429]  I think I'm going to come in next week and just play a bunch of clips of this.
[00:35:52.929 --> 00:35:56.151]  Now, most Hispanics hate this.
[00:35:56.311 --> 00:36:02.354]  Most Hispanics can't stand it, but they then get called sellouts.
[00:36:02.998 --> 00:36:05.879]  If they don't go with the pro-nationalist groups from Mexico.
[00:36:06.559 --> 00:36:09.719]  You see, people have been taught that the U.S.
[00:36:09.759 --> 00:36:12.440]  belongs to Mexico, who come from Mexico.
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:19.381]  And then, the Mexicans come from where they're dirt poor and oppressed completely in a very corrupt system.
[00:36:19.781 --> 00:36:27.962]  They get here and they see Hispanics, whites, blacks, Asians, and others that are part of the system, that see themselves as Americans, doing better than them.
[00:36:28.262 --> 00:36:31.183]  They see themselves having to take the menial, lower-paid jobs.
[00:36:32.406 --> 00:36:35.467]  And so there also, you know, a lot of anger gets created and generated.
[00:36:35.727 --> 00:36:38.428]  But you have the Ford Foundation, the Bush White House, the Democrats.
[00:36:39.208 --> 00:36:44.850]  Rob Allen and co., this was in the Dallas Morning News three years ago, three Christmases ago, or two and a half Christmases ago.
[00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:52.573]  They, two and a half years ago to be technical, they, it was in the news that they were going to finance marches all over the country.
[00:36:52.613 --> 00:36:59.175]  And big packing houses and big companies paid their employees to be off and go march in these things all over the country.
[00:36:59.695 --> 00:37:02.116]  And so I knew, this was in the Dallas Morning News, it was all staged.
[00:37:03.392 --> 00:37:06.355]  But still, no one seemed to know that as it unfolded for the next two years.
[00:37:07.716 --> 00:37:15.122]  That is, big corporations who want to drive down wages, who want to break down the sovereignty of this country, are financing all of this.
[00:37:16.423 --> 00:37:20.486]  Financing, driving down the wages, breaking down the country, and they want to divide and conquer.
[00:37:20.506 --> 00:37:26.110]  They want a Southwest that's majority people who believe this belongs to Mexico.
[00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:29.493]  See, Americans have been taught to be anti-nationalistic, to hate their country,
[00:37:30.747 --> 00:37:36.172]  That America's bad, that sovereignty's bad, that we've got to be globalist, that the UN's got to run us.
[00:37:38.073 --> 00:37:41.896]  But then, conversely, Mexico is one of the most nationalistic countries in the world.
[00:37:42.216 --> 00:37:45.018]  They've been taught to hate America, to hate the United States.
[00:37:46.039 --> 00:37:48.161]  And so, that's the recipe we've got.
[00:37:50.423 --> 00:37:50.763]  Alright?
[00:37:51.343 --> 00:37:54.906]  Folks, I want to do business with the Mexicans from Mexico who are here.
[00:37:55.427 --> 00:37:56.788]  I want to be their friends.
[00:37:56.928 --> 00:37:58.549]  I want them to fight the New World Order.
[00:38:00.313 --> 00:38:02.094]  I want their children to be healthy and happy.
[00:38:02.194 --> 00:38:04.116]  I want them to have good medical care.
[00:38:04.216 --> 00:38:05.737]  I want them to do well.
[00:38:06.317 --> 00:38:11.701]  But I cannot sit here while... Here's an example.
[00:38:13.763 --> 00:38:17.305]  White-owned, U.S.-owned TV company.
[00:38:19.046 --> 00:38:21.889]  Three years ago, and you can just type this in, L.A.
[00:38:21.909 --> 00:38:23.670]  billboards say, L.A.
[00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:24.490]  belongs to Mexico.
[00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:25.871]  Type that into Google, it'll come up.
[00:38:26.192 --> 00:38:26.672]  It's in the news.
[00:38:29.554 --> 00:38:37.057]  They ran 670-something billboards that show the TV anchors, Spanish TV, and it said LA.
[00:38:38.478 --> 00:38:40.559]  And then it was crossed out and it said Mexico.
[00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:52.164]  Now, why do you think the rich, white TV network, the network that owns this, has hundreds of stations, both English and Spanish, across the country,
[00:38:53.004 --> 00:38:54.184]  Why do you think they ran that?
[00:38:54.264 --> 00:38:59.466]  Well, A, they know that that's the prevailing, that's the dominant, cultural ideal in view.
[00:39:00.086 --> 00:39:03.607]  And I just can't sit here and ignore that the emperor has no clothes and say this isn't going on.
[00:39:05.688 --> 00:39:14.211]  Okay, that's going on, A. B, the corporates also want the breakup of the U.S.
[00:39:14.231 --> 00:39:17.332]  They're already busy merging Canada and Mexico with the U.S.
[00:39:17.652 --> 00:39:19.152]  and getting rid of our Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:39:19.172 --> 00:39:20.873]  It's called the Security and Prosperity Partnership.
[00:39:21.237 --> 00:39:24.219]  And there are good statesmen, politicians in Mexico, the U.S.
[00:39:24.259 --> 00:39:29.724]  and Canada, last week who were getting together to introduce legislation in all three countries to scrap the SPP.
[00:39:31.705 --> 00:39:45.256]  Now, I've actually found that Mexicans from Mexico know about the New World Order, know about implantable chips, know about government-sponsored terror, know about tyranny, are actually more savvy to tyranny in most respects than dumbed-down, spoiled Americans.
[00:39:46.457 --> 00:39:48.239]  But then they still have this cultural
[00:39:50.334 --> 00:39:52.056]  Zeitgeist of hating the U.S.
[00:39:52.116 --> 00:39:54.357]  and believing that the Southwest belongs to them.
[00:39:54.417 --> 00:39:58.259]  Like, oh, we'd be doing great if we just had the U.S.
[00:39:58.299 --> 00:39:59.520]  You know, they stole that from us.
[00:40:00.761 --> 00:40:03.643]  There were no Mexicans to speak of here when Spain ran it.
[00:40:04.223 --> 00:40:06.124]  Mexico didn't exist, but 5,000 total.
[00:40:06.344 --> 00:40:11.087]  A little bit under that number, actually, at the time of the war with Texas.
[00:40:11.427 --> 00:40:12.648]  That's the whole Southwest.
[00:40:16.348 --> 00:40:21.653]  Mexico has triple the natural resources of all of the United States, including Alaska and Hawaii.
[00:40:22.994 --> 00:40:25.816]  But you don't have wealth, because it is a culture of corruption.
[00:40:25.836 --> 00:40:28.498]  And I don't want to hear, oh, you can't make judgments about culture.
[00:40:28.859 --> 00:40:30.820]  I can say the Nazi culture was degenerate.
[00:40:30.901 --> 00:40:35.204]  Black uniforms, mass killings, concentration camps, warmongering.
[00:40:35.805 --> 00:40:37.606]  I can say the Aztec culture was bad.
[00:40:37.987 --> 00:40:39.548]  Humans sacrificing their children.
[00:40:39.948 --> 00:40:40.449]  Is that good?
[00:40:41.289 --> 00:40:43.031]  I can say the Babylonian culture was bad.
[00:40:46.189 --> 00:40:47.610]  You know, compared to other cultures.
[00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:49.011]  You can judge cultures.
[00:40:49.051 --> 00:40:50.312]  No, cultures are not equal.
[00:40:52.954 --> 00:41:00.060]  And Western modern culture has been anti-corruption, pro-art, pro-science, pro-ideas, pro-due process, Magna Carta 1215.
[00:41:01.621 --> 00:41:03.382]  That was the lie of the world created.
[00:41:03.723 --> 00:41:05.144]  Now it's become the evil of the world.
[00:41:05.504 --> 00:41:07.606]  Because power corruption, absolute power corruption, absolutely.
[00:41:07.806 --> 00:41:10.448]  Because the West developed all the major structures
[00:41:11.412 --> 00:41:16.635]  And all the major dominant sciences and systems and got all the power, it has become evil and ruthless and corrupt.
[00:41:16.935 --> 00:41:18.896]  I'm not debating that the West is very evil.
[00:41:19.516 --> 00:41:20.477]  It is an evil culture.
[00:41:20.637 --> 00:41:21.877]  Fifty million abortions is evil.
[00:41:22.397 --> 00:41:30.742]  But it's different, and it's becoming corrupt just like Mexico with the classic kind of Napoleonic or French-type corruption.
[00:41:32.222 --> 00:41:34.824]  The French have a... I could use a European model of that.
[00:41:35.224 --> 00:41:39.846]  Or the old Spanish-or corruption, or the Castilian corruption, or the old
[00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:41.531]  Portuguese-type corruption.
[00:41:42.592 --> 00:41:50.741]  It's called mordido, or little bite, paying off the police, or it's called beak-dipping.
[00:41:51.682 --> 00:41:56.367]  And I mean, I've been in Mexico many times, and almost every time I'm there, cops pull you over randomly and say a hundred dollars.
[00:41:58.409 --> 00:42:00.932]  And if you don't pay it to them, they'll take your wife into the station and rape her!
[00:42:02.102 --> 00:42:06.746]  I mean, you're a dumb gringo down there driving across the border and they find a .22 shell casing under your seat.
[00:42:07.046 --> 00:42:08.307]  You're going to jail for five years.
[00:42:08.327 --> 00:42:09.808]  They're going to suck every dime out of your family.
[00:42:10.028 --> 00:42:11.249]  They run credit reports on you.
[00:42:11.269 --> 00:42:12.090]  Find out how much money you got.
[00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:14.232]  I'm tired of the double standard.
[00:42:17.054 --> 00:42:18.655]  So, so, absolute vodka.
[00:42:18.675 --> 00:42:19.536]  I'm going to finish up with this.
[00:42:19.556 --> 00:42:23.059]  I know we got callers, but I'm going to finish up with this because this is an important subject.
[00:42:23.819 --> 00:42:26.842]  I'm not going to sit here and cover this up and act like this doesn't exist.
[00:42:28.003 --> 00:42:29.704]  We're in deep trouble, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:29.724 --> 00:42:30.785]  We need to come together.
[00:42:31.289 --> 00:42:35.313]  Stop hating each other and realize the globalists are playing us off against each other.
[00:42:35.933 --> 00:42:43.921]  You can see the map of the Reconquista from the Absolute Vodka ad at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now, main page.
[00:42:54.051 --> 00:42:54.551]  Hi, neighbor.
[00:42:54.851 --> 00:42:57.573]  They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[00:42:58.153 --> 00:43:02.875]  Certainly we'd never intend to procrastinate getting our own food supply until there was none left at any price.
[00:43:03.436 --> 00:43:08.558]  We would intend to have plenty of food so the relief organizations could care for those unable to care for themselves.
[00:43:09.179 --> 00:43:16.262]  We would intend not to be standing in the bread line with the ignorant and the foolish who pretend the facts of food disappearance are untrue.
[00:43:16.782 --> 00:43:21.685]  If the experience of the Katrina disaster is evidence, the bread line may have no bread.
[00:43:22.285 --> 00:43:29.327]  Just like the good intentions on the road to that unheavenly place, the good intentions alone to get a supply of food will not feed us.
[00:43:30.108 --> 00:43:34.549]  Only getting our food supply immediately will make us independent and fearless for the future.
[00:43:35.229 --> 00:43:35.509]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:43:35.529 --> 00:43:35.569]  800-409-5633.
[00:43:35.609 --> 00:43:36.570]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[00:43:36.610 --> 00:43:36.890]  Who am I?
[00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:37.030]  Nobody.
[00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:38.210]  Steve Schenck, Someone Who Cares.
[00:43:54.753 --> 00:44:01.517]  There are many types of storable foods, but how about a superfood that contains every nutrient that the human body needs for survival?
[00:44:01.537 --> 00:44:13.564]  50% protein, 300 milligrams of potassium per ounce, and calcium and magnesium for your heart and bones, with many more nutrients found in this incredible food source that the government does not want you to have.
[00:44:13.844 --> 00:44:18.847]  This product is available in powder, seeds, and oil, and is shipped free to your door in the U.S.
[00:44:19.147 --> 00:44:22.668]  This product is illegal to grow in the U.S., but is legal to import.
[00:44:22.928 --> 00:44:25.149]  Don't waste time thinking about storing food.
[00:44:25.349 --> 00:44:30.131]  Plan ahead and prepare for yourself and your family now, and be in control of your destiny.
[00:44:30.391 --> 00:44:34.553]  You can save and invest your money, but in the end, food will be your greatest asset.
[00:44:34.853 --> 00:44:38.075]  Remember what the Word of God says in Ezekiel 719.
[00:44:38.335 --> 00:44:43.518]  Call 908-691-2608 and see what the powder, seeds, and oil can do for you.
[00:44:43.798 --> 00:44:46.039]  Remember, food will be your greatest asset.
[00:44:46.259 --> 00:44:46.479]  Call 908-691-2608.
[00:44:46.499 --> 00:44:48.200]  This product does not contain THC.
[00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:48.520]  Call 908-691-2608.
[00:44:53.343 --> 00:44:54.003]  It's a fact.
[00:44:54.203 --> 00:45:01.687]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:45:01.807 --> 00:45:10.670]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:21.495]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:45:21.735 --> 00:45:27.798]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[00:45:28.019 --> 00:45:33.042]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[00:45:33.222 --> 00:45:37.724]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[00:45:37.864 --> 00:45:39.685]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[00:45:39.725 --> 00:45:40.006]  That's 877-943-8600.
[00:45:40.026 --> 00:45:40.526]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[00:45:40.546 --> 00:45:42.387]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[00:45:49.591 --> 00:45:52.593]  Visit FDRS.org today.
[00:45:53.073 --> 00:45:59.277]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:45:59.757 --> 00:46:07.522]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:46:07.862 --> 00:46:15.707]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:46:16.027 --> 00:46:20.790]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:46:21.110 --> 00:46:25.833]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:46:26.333 --> 00:46:30.196]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:46:30.696 --> 00:46:31.697]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:46:31.777 --> 00:46:35.859]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:46:36.279 --> 00:46:40.662]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:46:41.182 --> 00:46:43.704]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:46:44.164 --> 00:46:45.925]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:46:45.945 --> 00:46:46.285]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:46:46.365 --> 00:46:47.285]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:46:47.365 --> 00:46:49.105]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:47:08.123 --> 00:47:10.264]  By the way, Paul's in there.
[00:47:10.284 --> 00:47:20.510]  Heard me talking about all the clips we have.
[00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:22.691]  So he started doing searches.
[00:47:23.812 --> 00:47:25.933]  Why don't you Google gringo killer?
[00:47:26.673 --> 00:47:28.494]  That's the most popular Mexican wrestler.
[00:47:29.115 --> 00:47:30.876]  It's all about how he kills the gringos.
[00:47:31.756 --> 00:47:35.938]  Or go to Professor Gutierrez, the head of Chicano Studies at the University of Texas.
[00:47:37.552 --> 00:47:40.535]  New York Times interviews, he says, yes, all whites must be killed.
[00:47:41.255 --> 00:47:43.277]  In fact, I played it on my TV show before.
[00:47:43.297 --> 00:47:44.458]  This is the head of Chicano Studies.
[00:47:44.478 --> 00:47:52.225]  This is the founder of the second largest Hispanic organization in the country that every major corporation, I mean there's hundreds of them, gives money to.
[00:47:54.206 --> 00:47:57.169]  GM, Ford, Miller, just all of them.
[00:47:58.370 --> 00:48:02.073]  And then, I'm sitting here, this guy's saying we need to be killed.
[00:48:02.874 --> 00:48:04.055]  He wants to kill me!
[00:48:06.093 --> 00:48:07.253]  And people in this L.A.
[00:48:07.293 --> 00:48:10.415]  Times article, there's hundreds and hundreds of comments in their comment section.
[00:48:10.435 --> 00:48:11.095]  You've got to go read them.
[00:48:11.275 --> 00:48:15.836]  We have a link to it up on InfoWars.com, if you want an easy place to find the story in the L.A.
[00:48:15.876 --> 00:48:16.196]  Times.
[00:48:19.338 --> 00:48:20.598]  They will quote this stuff.
[00:48:20.618 --> 00:48:25.580]  They'll put links up to this, and then the LaRiconquistas come in and say, yes, you're an evil white.
[00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:26.840]  You need to be killed.
[00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:28.361]  You're a racist.
[00:48:28.401 --> 00:48:28.581]  See?
[00:48:28.601 --> 00:48:29.541]  You don't want to die.
[00:48:31.001 --> 00:48:32.462]  The Texas Civil Rights Review
[00:48:34.025 --> 00:48:44.992]  When I did a TV report on the plan of San Diego, the plan to kill all whites 16 and older, and then forcibly adopt and re-educate the rest of the whites.
[00:48:46.293 --> 00:48:50.256]  That was the German plan, because they knew how to sell the Mexicans on attacking the U.S.
[00:48:50.276 --> 00:49:02.784]  when they got desperate in World War I. The Texas Civil Rights Review, you can pull it up, they said, well, Mr. Jones is backwards and bad, and it is true the plan of San Diego is to kill the whites, but, in fact,
[00:49:04.127 --> 00:49:06.168]  Type the Plan of San Diego into Google.
[00:49:06.208 --> 00:49:13.753]  You'll find articles we wrote about it, and articles we wrote about what the Texas Civil Rights Review said, and you can link through and read their comments on their own newspaper.
[00:49:14.093 --> 00:49:21.458]  And they said, yes, but Hispanics have been downtrodden by evil whites, and so it's okay to talk about how all whites need to be killed.
[00:49:23.819 --> 00:49:26.501]  By the way, if you're listening to this for the first time, I'm not joking.
[00:49:26.881 --> 00:49:27.982]  I try to not cover this.
[00:49:28.062 --> 00:49:28.802]  It's very painful.
[00:49:28.842 --> 00:49:31.084]  I try to ignore it, but
[00:49:34.249 --> 00:49:35.770]  It's very, very, very, very sad.
[00:49:37.650 --> 00:49:39.191]  It's very, very, very, very sad.
[00:49:40.051 --> 00:49:44.172]  But it feels good, it's very primitive, and everybody likes to hate other groups.
[00:49:44.192 --> 00:49:45.873]  You know, it's very primitive.
[00:49:45.933 --> 00:49:59.277]  Blacks like to hate whites, and whites like to hate blacks, and the blacks and whites love to fight with Hispanics, and some of the Hispanics... And then, even if you don't like racism or tribalism, because the hate's coming at you, it makes it real, and you don't want to give in to it.
[00:50:00.672 --> 00:50:04.394]  And then it gets so ridiculous that the politicians run all this and control this.
[00:50:04.975 --> 00:50:08.937]  We've got all these Gutierrez clips, and I've got a Charlton Heston interview I did I want to play.
[00:50:09.477 --> 00:50:17.322]  I've got my interview I did with Jesse Ventura this week that made headlines all over the country.
[00:50:17.862 --> 00:50:19.523]  I've got a lot of other subjects I want to cover.
[00:50:20.684 --> 00:50:25.967]  The eugenicists are poisoning us, sterilizing us, black, white, old, young, Hispanic.
[00:50:26.087 --> 00:50:26.727]  It doesn't matter.
[00:50:26.747 --> 00:50:29.849]  We're all in this together, and they're just playing us off against each other.
[00:50:30.131 --> 00:50:34.735]  But it's so outrageous that you turn on Mexican TV.
[00:50:36.437 --> 00:50:47.567]  No, I mean, HBO last year had a comedy special where that popular comedian, I was watching TV one night, he was on there, the whole thing was racist, anti-gringo.
[00:50:47.988 --> 00:50:49.529]  And hell, it was in English.
[00:50:52.332 --> 00:50:53.353]  So, here's the deal.
[00:50:54.995 --> 00:51:00.757]  I am the son of liberal types who were taught they were white and evil and bad.
[00:51:01.017 --> 00:51:03.957]  And so I'm brought up that everyone is good but whites and I'm evil.
[00:51:04.958 --> 00:51:09.399]  And then I learned that no matter how much I grovel, I'm hated and everyone's planning to kill me.
[00:51:10.899 --> 00:51:11.600]  So to hell with it!
[00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:13.160]  I'm not going to kiss your butt anymore, man.
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:13.640]  It's over.
[00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:14.960]  The fun, the games are over.
[00:51:15.201 --> 00:51:17.281]  And if all this race stuff continues, fine.
[00:51:18.681 --> 00:51:20.482]  But you're the racist, the people out there.
[00:51:21.542 --> 00:51:24.103]  I mean, I've protested the Ku Klux Klan so many times.
[00:51:24.588 --> 00:51:32.149]  And I remember being on the phone with these LaRica and Quichas who were going to have this anti-America march, where they wave Mexican flags and chant Oslon.
[00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:35.650]  The motto is, for our race, everything.
[00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:37.451]  For those outside the race, nothing.
[00:51:40.431 --> 00:51:42.251]  And I just said, you know, I protested the Klan.
[00:51:42.451 --> 00:51:43.772]  And the guy's like giggling on the phone.
[00:51:43.792 --> 00:51:45.272]  Well, you ought to go join them, gringo.
[00:51:45.312 --> 00:51:45.872]  We don't want you.
[00:51:45.892 --> 00:51:48.493]  You know, it's like how I'm pathetic.
[00:51:48.633 --> 00:51:50.073]  I'm weak because I want to be friendly.
[00:51:51.229 --> 00:52:03.358]  And then just giggling and snickering and just knowing that this country is so weak now, so chicken-necked, so pathetic, puts up with anything, goes along with anything, puts up!
[00:52:05.359 --> 00:52:08.942]  There were a couple million people in Mexico in the 1840s.
[00:52:10.122 --> 00:52:13.245]  There's a hundred million in the country and thirty million in our country now.
[00:52:14.085 --> 00:52:16.067]  It's going to be two hundred million in another thirty years.
[00:52:16.967 --> 00:52:17.888]  The West is dying.
[00:52:17.908 --> 00:52:19.169]  The third world's exploding.
[00:52:19.509 --> 00:52:20.670]  I'm fighting the globalists.
[00:52:21.087 --> 00:52:34.741]  from exterminating you trying to stop the real ops but you trust your government you trust your it's so sick and then it's all this race thing you think that the new world order is for the country breaking down it's for
[00:52:36.283 --> 00:52:40.384]  Did you know that the Royal Commission on Population, written up by the British, that's the blueprint of the U.S.
[00:52:40.424 --> 00:52:46.766]  plan, says that they actually block third world countries from industrializing and from becoming first world?
[00:52:46.826 --> 00:52:49.607]  They want you to have a bunch of kids, because it holds you back.
[00:52:49.927 --> 00:52:51.367]  They want you to be in squalor.
[00:52:51.587 --> 00:52:53.328]  They want only 1% having the money.
[00:52:53.548 --> 00:53:00.230]  They want the peon system, that just means, peon means slave, means ranch slave, here in the U.S.
[00:53:01.090 --> 00:53:01.870]  You see, the U.S.
[00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:05.651]  is like a lifeboat that 20 people can be in, and we've already got 100 and it's sinking.
[00:53:06.124 --> 00:53:09.385]  And they just want to have the third world overwhelm and bring this country down.
[00:53:09.425 --> 00:53:10.765]  That's in globalist documents.
[00:53:12.225 --> 00:53:14.305]  You know, there's so many of these Gutierrez clips.
[00:53:14.546 --> 00:53:16.586]  Have you found the one where he says whites need to be killed?
[00:53:17.386 --> 00:53:18.506]  Because there's so many clips.
[00:53:18.906 --> 00:53:26.168]  We were in there during a three minute break trying to, with like 50 different clips, with just how we've got, and this is the head of UT Chicano Studies.
[00:53:26.728 --> 00:53:27.148]  UT!
[00:53:29.128 --> 00:53:30.708]  Big eugenics front organization.
[00:53:31.209 --> 00:53:32.369]  Totally whitey run.
[00:53:32.609 --> 00:53:33.309]  Why do they do this?
[00:53:33.996 --> 00:53:35.437]  Because they want us all at each other's throats.
[00:53:35.497 --> 00:53:38.100]  The big money wants to bring down the U.S.
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:39.181]  And don't worry, the U.S.
[00:53:39.241 --> 00:53:39.721]  is falling.
[00:53:39.901 --> 00:53:40.782]  The dollar's dying.
[00:53:40.822 --> 00:53:41.503]  Everything's dying.
[00:53:41.743 --> 00:53:43.505]  If you're Hispanic, black, white, it doesn't matter.
[00:53:43.545 --> 00:53:44.205]  It's hurting you.
[00:53:46.187 --> 00:53:49.991]  I mean, I remember being at an event three years ago, and like, what are all these Plano San Diego shirts?
[00:53:50.271 --> 00:53:53.113]  And a Hispanic listener of mine walks up and goes, man, you need to Google that.
[00:53:53.153 --> 00:53:54.154]  You don't know Mr. Jones?
[00:53:54.975 --> 00:53:59.159]  And another guy comes up, a white guy, and goes, yeah, I'm a history professor at UT.
[00:53:59.199 --> 00:54:00.340]  That means kill all whites.
[00:54:01.107 --> 00:54:04.670]  And I said no, and I went home and googled it and it was mainstream.
[00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:06.871]  A huge plan to kill me?
[00:54:07.131 --> 00:54:07.932]  What did I do?
[00:54:09.053 --> 00:54:12.135]  I'm a limp-wristed chicken neck walking around feeling guilty.
[00:54:13.776 --> 00:54:14.737]  Guilty for what?
[00:54:15.397 --> 00:54:19.820]  My ancestors kicked the butt of the Imperial Spanish.
[00:54:20.201 --> 00:54:23.083]  They kicked the butt of the Imperial British.
[00:54:23.463 --> 00:54:24.944]  Imperial systems didn't work.
[00:54:25.765 --> 00:54:26.926]  Were my ancestors perfect?
[00:54:26.986 --> 00:54:27.186]  No.
[00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:29.721]  Y'all hear this, well the U.S.
[00:54:29.741 --> 00:54:30.341]  had slavery.
[00:54:30.542 --> 00:54:32.683]  Hell, Mexico still basically got slavery.
[00:54:32.904 --> 00:54:33.644]  Just a different name.
[00:54:33.965 --> 00:54:34.605]  You ready to play him?
[00:54:35.266 --> 00:54:36.927]  Here's the head of Chicano Studies, U.T.
[00:54:36.967 --> 00:54:38.549]  There's so many clips, just play some of it.
[00:54:38.909 --> 00:54:41.591]  You have to believe in yourself because the fight begins with you!
[00:54:42.172 --> 00:54:44.333]  Self-determination, the first word is self!
[00:54:45.254 --> 00:54:45.655]  You!
[00:54:47.556 --> 00:54:49.378]  And we believed it in the Chicano Movement.
[00:54:50.739 --> 00:54:51.820]  We believed it!
[00:54:53.241 --> 00:54:55.223]  So we said, we're gonna build a plan!
[00:54:55.863 --> 00:54:56.384]  Right here!
[00:54:58.354 --> 00:55:00.576]  And each one of us begin in our own way.
[00:55:02.237 --> 00:55:06.720]  The Brown Berets, for example, is a defense unit for all of us.
[00:55:08.181 --> 00:55:11.043]  The Mayo Chapters in Texas was full walkout.
[00:55:11.583 --> 00:55:15.265]  Como en California los El Castros and the Lincoln Heights and the Roosevelt Heights.
[00:55:15.986 --> 00:55:18.167]  Los Rosalio Muñoz is fighting against the war.
[00:55:19.608 --> 00:55:26.293]  Los Raul Rices y los demás in that area with La Raza Magazine and the early Chicano Studies program, Del Plan de San Diego.
[00:55:27.216 --> 00:55:32.620]  If you go back and read any basic book... Hit pause.
[00:55:33.861 --> 00:55:35.002]  Now, he goes on and on.
[00:55:35.223 --> 00:55:36.303]  This is from my TV show.
[00:55:36.363 --> 00:55:37.024]  This is from UT.
[00:55:37.124 --> 00:55:39.246]  Okay, this is University of Texas.
[00:55:39.906 --> 00:55:44.970]  Now, you go Google Plan of San Diego, and then he says, we need to implement the Plan of San Diego!
[00:55:45.391 --> 00:55:47.432]  You wanna kill me and my family?
[00:55:48.213 --> 00:55:49.974]  And I'm not supposed to talk about it?
[00:55:53.377 --> 00:55:55.419]  All I can say is from the shores of, uh...
[00:55:56.420 --> 00:56:00.323]  Tripoli, ladies and gentlemen, from the halls of Montezuma.
[00:56:00.603 --> 00:56:01.764]  And, you know, that's the point here.
[00:56:02.084 --> 00:56:09.349]  The U.S., when Mexico attacked it, marched down, took over your country, should have freed all the slaves, the people living on the peon ranches.
[00:56:12.632 --> 00:56:13.893]  Should have freed all the people.
[00:56:14.934 --> 00:56:16.174]  And it should just be part of the U.S.
[00:56:16.194 --> 00:56:20.818]  And then we'd have... I don't care if it was brown-skinned people everywhere, as long as they were Americans!
[00:56:22.768 --> 00:56:27.410]  Imagine that place would be an incredible engine right now of economy and liberty and freedom.
[00:56:27.790 --> 00:56:28.610]  Hell, I could live in the U.S.
[00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:29.731]  and live in Cancun.
[00:56:30.791 --> 00:56:33.792]  It isn't that I don't want to be around brown people.
[00:56:33.892 --> 00:56:39.814]  It's that my cousin happened to speak Spanish and so he would say, oh man, I'm a bartender.
[00:56:39.854 --> 00:56:40.575]  You ought to hear it.
[00:56:40.635 --> 00:56:44.196]  Then they walk up and say, hey dirty white scum, give me a drink.
[00:56:44.256 --> 00:56:47.017]  And he'll flash back in Spanish, hey how dare you talk to me like that?
[00:56:47.077 --> 00:56:47.677]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:56:48.017 --> 00:56:48.838]  Then it's a big joke.
[00:56:49.618 --> 00:56:52.039]  And my wife speaks Spanish growing up in Spain.
[00:56:52.748 --> 00:56:54.149]  And it totally freaks her out.
[00:56:54.209 --> 00:56:55.290]  Man, I'm tired of it.
[00:56:56.090 --> 00:56:59.492]  And then I went and found out, and now I see it on the sides of restaurants.
[00:57:00.213 --> 00:57:04.656]  Restaurants I used to go in have, like, basically, we're gonna get the whites on the side of it.
[00:57:05.576 --> 00:57:11.900]  And it's like a big joke, like a smuck, I'd walk in there while I'm being hated, while stuff's being done to my food.
[00:57:14.182 --> 00:57:15.522]  You know, I mean, this is sick!
[00:57:16.463 --> 00:57:17.684]  Can't we just live in peace?
[00:57:21.562 --> 00:57:22.262]  No, we can't.
[00:57:22.302 --> 00:57:23.643]  The globalists are going to have their way.
[00:57:23.663 --> 00:57:25.704]  They're going to destroy the dollar.
[00:57:25.724 --> 00:57:26.645]  They're going to bring the country down.
[00:57:26.665 --> 00:57:27.665]  They're going to have a race war.
[00:57:28.125 --> 00:57:30.206]  And we'll all be slaves and our children will have no future.
[00:57:30.707 --> 00:57:31.607]  Globalists win again.
[00:57:31.627 --> 00:57:35.889]  It's like they play different native tribes off against each other in Africa or in the U.S.
[00:57:36.689 --> 00:57:38.070]  They'll play us off against each other.
[00:57:38.490 --> 00:57:39.971]  We could wake up and win, but we won't.
[00:57:40.191 --> 00:57:41.612]  It feels too good to be idiots.
[00:57:43.228 --> 00:57:44.229]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:57:44.289 --> 00:57:47.430]  As you know, GCN is a huge supporter of Ron Paul and all he stands for.
[00:57:47.530 --> 00:57:55.772]  That's why, for a limited time, I have personally set aside commercial inventory allowing advertisers the chance to show their personal support for Ron Paul while promoting their products.

[00:58:17.396 --> 00:58:19.297]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:58:20.018 --> 00:58:23.180]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:58:23.841 --> 00:58:30.325]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.

[01:03:54.885 --> 01:03:58.186]  The company says it's evaluating its bid for Yahoo.
[01:03:58.727 --> 01:04:06.250]  Sources familiar with the situation say the internet company may have lost value since Microsoft made its offer in January.
[01:04:06.290 --> 01:04:11.833]  Sources say Yahoo has lost some key personnel, making the company less valuable.
[01:04:12.353 --> 01:04:13.233]  I'm Jackson Ivey.
[01:04:13.413 --> 01:04:18.735]  International Monetary Fund in England has issued a grim report on the future of the global economy.

[01:04:44.607 --> 01:04:48.830]  I'm Jason Walker, IRN USA Radio News.
[01:04:51.584 --> 01:04:57.306]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[01:04:57.667 --> 01:05:03.289]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high-stress lifestyles.
[01:05:03.609 --> 01:05:07.471]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[01:05:07.771 --> 01:05:12.653]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.

[01:06:32.101 --> 01:06:39.385]  I've got this Charlton Heston interview that I did seven years ago that's never re-aired since and isn't on the internet.
[01:06:39.446 --> 01:06:42.987]  I'm going to air all of it later on the weekday show coming up this week.
[01:06:44.348 --> 01:06:48.470]  The Jesse Ventura interview we did made it all over national and international news.
[01:06:48.551 --> 01:06:50.171]  I'm going to play a few minutes of that today.
[01:06:50.191 --> 01:06:52.233]  I've got a bunch of other important news.
[01:06:52.733 --> 01:06:54.214]  I said I'd get to your calls and we will.
[01:06:55.674 --> 01:06:55.815]  At 877-590.
[01:06:58.852 --> 01:06:58.992]  5-5-2-5.
[01:06:59.032 --> 01:07:03.614]  We're toll-free all over Central Texas.
[01:07:03.634 --> 01:07:05.134]  8-3-6-0-5-9-0.
[01:07:05.794 --> 01:07:07.135]  Somebody has to talk about this.
[01:07:08.836 --> 01:07:16.118]  The fact that on the colleges, in the high schools... I mean, I've got a report here that we won't have time to play, but it's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:07:16.138 --> 01:07:18.619]  We're an Air Force veteran at a major university.
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:25.361]  The university took down the American flag and now flies the Mexican flag.
[01:07:25.401 --> 01:07:26.982]  There are eight South Texas towns
[01:07:27.517 --> 01:07:29.618]  But the City Halls fly Mexican flags and not U.S.
[01:07:29.658 --> 01:07:29.939]  flags.
[01:07:29.959 --> 01:07:32.140]  That's been in all over Texas papers.
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:33.421]  El Cenicho is the main one.
[01:07:33.441 --> 01:07:38.264]  I remember that 12 years ago and it finally hit CNN last week.
[01:07:38.344 --> 01:07:40.265]  And see, Lou Dobbs is bad to report on.
[01:07:40.285 --> 01:07:44.588]  But they fly the Mexican flag, not the American.
[01:07:45.528 --> 01:07:46.869]  Do you understand, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:07:46.889 --> 01:07:53.353]  This guy went and took down the university flag, ran up the Stars and Stripes, and he got arrested and he was just convicted.
[01:07:56.357 --> 01:08:00.258]  Hate crime, hate law, hate speech, it's all selectively enforced.
[01:08:02.738 --> 01:08:13.681]  It's all selectively enforced, and again, the big banks, the big money, wants to get rid of the U.S., wants to get rid of the middle class, and Hispanic Americans are the most patriotic people there are, statistically.
[01:08:14.281 --> 01:08:22.663]  Most people don't know this, there are more Congressional Medal of Honor winners, and I meant to make this point earlier, I just get so mad, who are Hispanic than any other group?
[01:08:23.763 --> 01:08:24.843]  Very patriotic people.
[01:08:25.421 --> 01:08:42.752]  I'll never forget being down in San Antonio when my cousin was about 12 years old, I was about 13, and he had his friends on the football team who were all Hispanic, and we'd go over to their houses, and you know, hang out and play football and stuff, and they would all say, man, what do you think about the illegal aliens?
[01:08:43.993 --> 01:08:51.517]  And I thought it was some test or something, I'm this chicken-neck liberal, and I had been totally taught to hate myself, and I said, what do you mean, the illegals?
[01:08:51.537 --> 01:08:52.658]  I don't even know what an illegal is!
[01:08:53.268 --> 01:08:55.729]  They're like, these illegal aliens that hate this country want to take it over!
[01:08:56.249 --> 01:09:00.011]  And I got to know those guys over, you know, five or six years before my cousin moved.
[01:09:00.031 --> 01:09:01.352]  You know, visiting once or twice a year.
[01:09:02.112 --> 01:09:04.433]  And Carlos and all of them, they were all serious.
[01:09:04.473 --> 01:09:05.754]  They knew they were Americans.
[01:09:06.054 --> 01:09:07.634]  Their dads were all former military.
[01:09:08.315 --> 01:09:09.996]  They were middle class, living in big houses.
[01:09:11.156 --> 01:09:14.377]  And they were hearing the Spanish of, we're going to get America, we're going to bring it down.
[01:09:14.698 --> 01:09:16.338]  Communism, you know, crap like that.
[01:09:17.759 --> 01:09:22.161]  And so, Hispanic Americans have to pay the same taxes everybody else does for the illegal aliens to get free taxes.
[01:09:23.086 --> 01:09:24.127]  By the way, they've done studies.
[01:09:26.168 --> 01:09:27.749]  More than half the people in L.A.
[01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:29.491]  More than half the people in Dallas County.
[01:09:31.032 --> 01:09:31.412]  In L.A.
[01:09:31.472 --> 01:09:34.414]  it's like 75% in the jails are illegal aliens.
[01:09:34.515 --> 01:09:36.356]  And why is it saying Mexicans are criminals?
[01:09:36.916 --> 01:09:37.136]  No!
[01:09:37.557 --> 01:09:39.558]  The criminals in Mexico run up here.
[01:09:40.479 --> 01:09:42.420]  And then they run back down when they get in trouble.
[01:09:42.821 --> 01:09:44.922]  And they got different names and different IDs.
[01:09:46.583 --> 01:09:49.926]  And so you got a hundred million people south of the border, their crooks come up here.
[01:09:52.606 --> 01:09:54.927]  So, you know, this is the type of stuff we're dealing with.
[01:09:54.967 --> 01:09:58.269]  I mean, did you know El Paso, across the border now, is a ghost town?
[01:09:58.289 --> 01:10:01.451]  Did you know Nuevo Laredo, across from Laredo, is a ghost town?
[01:10:02.691 --> 01:10:04.832]  The drug gangs, the crime, all of it.
[01:10:06.293 --> 01:10:11.936]  And this La Raza culture is really picked up because the media, the culture, the gringo-owned media pushes it.
[01:10:12.296 --> 01:10:13.437]  I mean, come on, put two and two together.
[01:10:13.697 --> 01:10:15.278]  Why does the rich gringo
[01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:23.043]  Sell and push all this La Raza, La Reconquista, because they want to break down the U.S.
[01:10:23.703 --> 01:10:27.945]  This is a triple team against the U.S., and the U.S.
[01:10:28.005 --> 01:10:28.525]  is falling.
[01:10:29.186 --> 01:10:30.086]  You want to get the U.S.?
[01:10:30.106 --> 01:10:30.547]  Don't worry.
[01:10:30.567 --> 01:10:31.707]  It's basically already gone.
[01:10:32.047 --> 01:10:35.189]  But what it's being replaced with is something far worse.
[01:10:37.330 --> 01:10:38.511]  Now, we've got all these clips.
[01:10:38.931 --> 01:10:39.931]  I mean, there's like ten of them.
[01:10:40.652 --> 01:10:42.313]  Just play him talking about the plan of San Diego.
[01:10:42.353 --> 01:10:43.994]  This is the head of UT Chicano Studies.
[01:10:44.794 --> 01:10:46.715]  He's the head of the entire Chicano Studies Department.
[01:10:48.223 --> 01:10:50.044]  Here he is.
[01:10:50.984 --> 01:10:54.886]  If you go back and read... Back it up again, I'm at the Plan of San Diego part.
[01:10:55.206 --> 01:10:58.927]  And don't believe me, Google, the Plan of San Diego.
[01:11:00.248 --> 01:11:02.469]  That is to kill all whites 16 and older.
[01:11:02.489 --> 01:11:08.631]  Now then you go to a Desus Seys Parade and there'll be green shirts that say Plan of San Diego all over the place.
[01:11:09.152 --> 01:11:10.832]  Don't believe me, go see!
[01:11:11.653 --> 01:11:14.894]  I mean, I'm the guy bullhorning the Klan, folks, I've done it more than 10 times.
[01:11:24.289 --> 01:11:35.112]  If you go back and read any basic book written by... And then it goes back to me on the TV show.
[01:11:35.132 --> 01:11:36.152]  Those are clips from my TV show.
[01:11:36.192 --> 01:11:37.133]  And then there's that other clip.
[01:11:37.153 --> 01:11:39.933]  Can you back up that other clip laughing about how the gringos are all dying?
[01:11:40.133 --> 01:11:44.495]  And then it's got quotes from him from his textbooks where he says, the blue-eyed devil is the greatest enemy.
[01:11:44.895 --> 01:11:45.835]  Wait, I wrote some notes.
[01:11:46.539 --> 01:11:48.040]  Off the New York Times.
[01:11:48.741 --> 01:11:50.262]  About the whites must be killed.
[01:11:51.804 --> 01:11:53.025]  It's that earlier clip you found.
[01:11:53.345 --> 01:11:54.046]  It doesn't matter.
[01:11:54.086 --> 01:11:57.168]  How am I ever going to get the calls or play all this stuff if I just keep ranting?
[01:11:57.208 --> 01:11:58.049]  It just freaks me out.
[01:11:58.409 --> 01:12:00.891]  What got me going is the fact that people finally are listening.
[01:12:02.253 --> 01:12:03.033]  La Plaza.
[01:12:03.073 --> 01:12:04.795]  This is out of the LA Times today.
[01:12:04.895 --> 01:12:06.656]  Mexico reconquers California.
[01:12:07.097 --> 01:12:08.218]  Absolute drinks to that.
[01:12:09.119 --> 01:12:10.880]  Latest advertising campaign in Mexico.
[01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:12.341]  From the Swedish vodka maker.
[01:12:12.421 --> 01:12:14.163]  Absolute promises to push
[01:12:14.798 --> 01:12:19.281]  The right button south of the border, but it could ruffle a few feathers in El Norte.
[01:12:19.921 --> 01:12:20.642]  That's the north.
[01:12:21.743 --> 01:12:23.284]  The billboard or Old Mexico.
[01:12:23.764 --> 01:12:37.113]  The billboard and press campaign created by advertising agency Ternatebia and now running in Mexico is a colorful map depicting what America might look like in a absolute, i.e.
[01:12:37.193 --> 01:12:37.873]  perfect world.
[01:12:39.294 --> 01:12:41.135]  So that's what this ad campaign is, what's ideal.
[01:12:41.455 --> 01:12:43.597]  The US-Mexico border lies where it was
[01:12:44.036 --> 01:12:52.739]  Before the Mexican-American War of 1848, when California, as we know it, and the Mexican Territory, was known as Alte California.
[01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:55.020]  And the article limits it.
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:13:03.184]  No, it shows Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma, Oregon, everything.
[01:13:03.684 --> 01:13:04.144]  Nevada.
[01:13:06.138 --> 01:13:10.522]  And it says, Mexicans talk about how America stole their land, so this is their way of reclaiming it.
[01:13:10.602 --> 01:13:12.885]  It's very relevant, and Mexicans love the idea.
[01:13:12.985 --> 01:13:14.546]  Now, that's the advertising campaign.
[01:13:15.167 --> 01:13:16.768]  The Swedes know what sells.
[01:13:17.769 --> 01:13:19.971]  Because this is a majority idea.
[01:13:20.532 --> 01:13:21.693]  And I say it's cheating.
[01:13:21.793 --> 01:13:23.014]  I say it's not fair play.
[01:13:24.216 --> 01:13:27.639]  To have a secret gear up for a race war and be,
[01:13:29.099 --> 01:13:38.986]  By the way, just look at AP photos of these marches the last two years saying, you know, legalize the illegal aliens, and Bush pushing and saying, oh, they love America, oh, the illegal aliens want to be friendly.
[01:13:39.787 --> 01:13:46.111]  And you look at the kids in school who are wearing the same shirts that say either La Reconquista, La Raza, or Plan de San Diego.
[01:13:47.012 --> 01:13:47.412]  He found it.
[01:13:47.432 --> 01:13:47.972]  Go ahead and roll it.
[01:13:48.713 --> 01:13:49.914]  We just have to survive.
[01:13:51.134 --> 01:13:53.676]  We have an aging, white America.
[01:13:55.878 --> 01:13:57.279]  They are not making babies.
[01:13:58.573 --> 01:13:59.194]  They're dying.
[01:14:00.416 --> 01:14:01.457]  It's a matter of time.
[01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:06.183]  The explosion is in our population.
[01:14:08.546 --> 01:14:09.828]  Alright, we'll come back.
[01:14:11.230 --> 01:14:12.131]  Oh yeah, crank it up.
[01:14:12.191 --> 01:14:13.913]  I'd like to build the world a coke.
[01:14:19.221 --> 01:14:22.322]  But don't talk about it, or you're an evil white racist!
[01:14:22.762 --> 01:14:28.264]  There are quotes in the LA Times, in the comments, going, we're gonna kill you, manifest destiny, all gringos will die.
[01:14:28.284 --> 01:14:32.786]  And then somebody says, how dare you to the guy, and he goes, see, racist, you need to die!
[01:14:34.367 --> 01:14:44.691]  It's just like the Texas Civil Rights Review said, yes, they were wearing shirts saying that all whites should be killed, but the whites are evil!
[01:14:46.331 --> 01:14:47.992]  And this was a white person writing the article.
[01:14:51.121 --> 01:14:52.562]  I mean, don't talk about it!
[01:14:52.622 --> 01:14:53.202]  It's evil!
[01:14:53.222 --> 01:14:53.562]  See?
[01:14:53.582 --> 01:14:54.763]  You're an evil whitey!
[01:14:56.524 --> 01:14:58.925]  I'm saying I want to kill you and your family!
[01:14:58.945 --> 01:15:02.226]  And you say you don't like it!
[01:15:02.246 --> 01:15:02.867]  You're racist!
[01:15:02.887 --> 01:15:03.387]  You're bad!
[01:15:03.407 --> 01:15:04.167]  You're not good!
[01:15:06.829 --> 01:15:09.370]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, all I can do is tell the truth.
[01:15:13.512 --> 01:15:14.232]  That's all I can do.
[01:15:14.893 --> 01:15:15.653]  I'm sick of it!
[01:15:16.674 --> 01:15:17.454]  I'm tired of it!
[01:15:18.959 --> 01:15:23.200]  Alright, I'm gonna come back, take calls, then I'm here on the Jesse Ventura and Charlton Heston interview.
[01:15:23.961 --> 01:15:27.242]  But I guess, hey, Charlton Heston, another dead white gringo, huh?
[01:15:27.722 --> 01:15:29.622]  Yay!
[01:15:30.183 --> 01:15:31.143]  Yay!
[01:15:31.703 --> 01:15:31.803]  Ah!
[01:15:31.883 --> 01:15:33.344]  They're dying!
[01:15:34.164 --> 01:15:35.064]  Good!
[01:15:36.445 --> 01:15:36.585]  Ah!
[01:15:37.865 --> 01:15:38.365]  Oh!
[01:15:38.985 --> 01:15:39.666]  Ah!
[01:15:39.966 --> 01:15:40.746]  We're right back!
[01:15:50.498 --> 01:15:51.899]  It is a big idea.
[01:15:51.919 --> 01:15:54.019]  A New World Order.
[01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:58.741]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:15:58.781 --> 01:16:02.422]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:16:02.462 --> 01:16:04.603]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:16:05.243 --> 01:16:07.684]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:16:08.424 --> 01:16:15.727]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:16:18.766 --> 01:16:23.729]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:16:24.210 --> 01:16:27.692]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:16:28.092 --> 01:16:30.594]  Bill Burgess is making great progress for the world government.
[01:16:30.654 --> 01:16:31.795]  Most people have no idea.
[01:16:31.835 --> 01:16:32.555]  They're not after money.
[01:16:32.575 --> 01:16:33.656]  They have all the money they need.
[01:16:33.896 --> 01:16:34.617]  They're after power.
[01:16:34.857 --> 01:16:35.697]  That's what they're after.
[01:16:36.018 --> 01:16:40.541]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[01:16:44.723 --> 01:16:45.084]  Endgame.
[01:16:45.504 --> 01:16:47.525]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:16:47.565 --> 01:16:48.546]  You have been warned.
[01:16:49.266 --> 01:16:51.247]  This is Steve Shank, J. Michael Stevens Group.
[01:16:51.567 --> 01:16:52.408]  Let's get real.
[01:16:52.848 --> 01:16:54.368]  Flour is already being rationed.
[01:16:54.568 --> 01:16:59.090]  Prices on food are getting so high, warehouses are installing security systems and guards.
[01:16:59.771 --> 01:17:03.012]  You can expect soon to see criminal activity in food.
[01:17:03.672 --> 01:17:10.995]  We're all in a foot race as to whether the food will become so expensive we can't afford it, or there will be no food at any price.
[01:17:11.636 --> 01:17:14.857]  We can't grow enough of our own food, even with genetically altered trash.
[01:17:15.623 --> 01:17:18.624]  It will give you the opportunity to eat perfectly engineered food.
[01:17:19.704 --> 01:17:23.125]  They think God didn't get it right, so Monsanto had to step in.
[01:17:23.925 --> 01:17:27.206]  If you think it's a little bit crazy to put in a supply of food, it's okay.
[01:17:27.766 --> 01:17:28.446]  We won't tell.
[01:17:28.987 --> 01:17:29.267]  Call 800-409-5633.
[01:17:29.287 --> 01:17:30.587]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[01:17:30.607 --> 01:17:30.987]  That's 800-409-5633.
[01:17:31.067 --> 01:17:33.988]  It may be a little bit crazy, that's okay.
[01:17:34.068 --> 01:17:35.428]  Because there is no
[01:17:50.229 --> 01:17:52.390]  Ted Anderson from Midas, April 4, 2008.
[01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:53.010]  Gold, 90180.
[01:17:53.490 --> 01:17:59.812]  Ounce gold coins can be purchased for 9.28, 4.57.10 for half, 2.28.55 for quarter.
[01:17:59.892 --> 01:18:00.672]  That's 9.28, 4.57.10, and 2.28.55.
[01:18:01.012 --> 01:18:07.114]  For years, Ron Paul has taken the position to uphold constitutional rights.
[01:18:07.414 --> 01:18:11.455]  He's been branded by special interest groups as doctrinal, refusing to bend his values.
[01:18:11.855 --> 01:18:15.676]  I can only imagine the pressure applied by Congress as he stands alone for these principles.
[01:18:16.056 --> 01:18:17.816]  He has given up a medical career for this.
[01:18:18.296 --> 01:18:19.956]  Ron Paul is running for President.
[01:18:20.216 --> 01:18:25.998]  The ideas of strong currency, ending the war, defending the Constitution, and protecting civil liberties are catching on.
[01:18:26.278 --> 01:18:32.839]  As a thank you, GCNlive.com, Midas Resources, and I would like to send you a free copy of the Ron Paul Family Cookbook.
[01:18:33.159 --> 01:18:33.999]  Call 800-686-2237 for your free copy.
[01:18:34.059 --> 01:18:34.899]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[01:18:40.265 --> 01:18:43.272]  I hope his values are touching your heart as deep as they are mine.
[01:18:43.392 --> 01:18:43.693]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:18:43.753 --> 01:18:45.156]  Thanks again for supporting Ron Paul.
[01:18:50.222 --> 01:18:52.742]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:18:53.083 --> 01:18:54.343]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[01:18:54.643 --> 01:18:56.623]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:18:56.783 --> 01:18:58.544]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:18:58.684 --> 01:18:59.924]  The late, great USA.
[01:19:00.184 --> 01:19:01.584]  America, freedom to fascism.
[01:19:01.944 --> 01:19:08.746]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[01:19:53.399 --> 01:19:55.740]  Are you tired of searching for great talk radio?
[01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:56.960]  Well, search no more.
[01:19:56.980 --> 01:19:59.302]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:02.103 --> 01:20:03.924]  Look, illegal aliens have a choice to make.
[01:20:06.084 --> 01:20:10.805]  If another 30 million or so come in, it will completely bankrupt all the states, the healthcare, the schools.
[01:20:10.825 --> 01:20:11.545]  It's already happened.
[01:20:12.906 --> 01:20:15.086]  And then they have no place for even themselves.
[01:20:15.626 --> 01:20:19.708]  That's why a lot of the illegals that get here, after a few years, agree on keeping the other illegals out.
[01:20:20.148 --> 01:20:21.868]  There's six plus billion third world people.
[01:20:21.888 --> 01:20:22.648]  They all want to come here.
[01:20:24.529 --> 01:20:25.809]  We will be a third world nation.
[01:20:26.669 --> 01:20:28.870]  We also have to ask ourselves, what's better, the U.S.
[01:20:28.930 --> 01:20:29.510]  or Mexico?
[01:20:30.510 --> 01:20:31.110]  The U.S.
[01:20:31.130 --> 01:20:33.051]  is becoming corrupt, becoming third world.
[01:20:34.733 --> 01:20:35.893]  I mean, I just want to live in peace.
[01:20:37.334 --> 01:20:42.675]  Hey, man, I like tequila and enchiladas, and I like, uh, you know, everybody.
[01:20:43.815 --> 01:20:47.256]  And I don't appreciate the fact that it's been popularized.
[01:20:47.316 --> 01:20:49.017]  I mean, it's really the majority view now.
[01:20:49.857 --> 01:20:50.957]  I'd say about 55-60%.
[01:20:51.057 --> 01:20:52.638]  And that's what Absolute says.
[01:20:53.218 --> 01:20:55.719]  Absolute said, well, we did this because this is the majority view.
[01:20:56.799 --> 01:20:58.639]  And the people are in this LA Times story.
[01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:02.741]  It's a whole bunch of articles, but this one has hundreds and hundreds of comments saying, yeah, this is our country.
[01:21:03.061 --> 01:21:03.941]  This belongs to Mexico.
[01:21:05.512 --> 01:21:08.854]  Well, if Mexico's so great, why aren't you in where Mexico's been running things?
[01:21:08.874 --> 01:21:15.197]  You know, I don't like Mordido, Little Bite, that's now going on in Texas with the cops, where they want to shake you down.
[01:21:15.577 --> 01:21:17.018]  I mean, I don't like that, folks.
[01:21:17.518 --> 01:21:21.240]  I don't go down to Mexico anymore, because it's so anti-American down there.
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:32.065]  I mean, this is really sad, and I'm telling you, if all this anti-America stuff continues, I am not gonna go to Mexico ever again, and I'm not gonna support anything that has to do with it.
[01:21:32.405 --> 01:21:34.106]  And I'm gonna, not that I drink,
[01:21:34.574 --> 01:21:37.195]  Because I go off and on drinking, but I drink very little.
[01:21:37.776 --> 01:21:40.237]  And I don't drink a lot of hard liquor, that's certainly for sure.
[01:21:40.277 --> 01:21:47.040]  But a couple years and I'm out somewhere and somebody's serving vodka martinis, I'm not drinking any Absolut vodka ever.
[01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:50.622]  And Absolut has now apologized and is in deep trouble.
[01:21:50.862 --> 01:21:52.202]  Hey, it's over for you, okay?
[01:21:52.502 --> 01:21:54.884]  The people know, they're just not supposed to talk about it.
[01:21:55.224 --> 01:21:56.925]  The people have now found out about all this.
[01:21:57.685 --> 01:22:01.207]  And I know you think the new demographic is Larry Conquista, so that's fine.
[01:22:01.227 --> 01:22:02.167]  You can just have fun with that.
[01:22:05.202 --> 01:22:06.783]  Okay, I've just blown the whole show on this.
[01:22:06.863 --> 01:22:15.290]  But, you know, it's important and... I mean, you can pick up the Spanish newspapers around here in Austin.
[01:22:15.330 --> 01:22:17.552]  It's full of racial dribble.
[01:22:17.972 --> 01:22:19.033]  I'm tired of it, man!
[01:22:20.354 --> 01:22:23.257]  See, first we're told not to have any national identity.
[01:22:24.097 --> 01:22:26.159]  And then we're told to be ashamed of who we are.
[01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:29.301]  And, I mean, I'm 34 years old, folks.
[01:22:29.421 --> 01:22:31.223]  I grew up not doing anything to anybody.
[01:22:34.085 --> 01:22:39.790]  I grew up in Dallas, where a couple times, three or four black guys would come up and say, we're gonna beat you up, honky.
[01:22:40.230 --> 01:22:43.033]  And I'd feel bad until they punched me and I had to go ahead and fight back.
[01:22:43.353 --> 01:22:45.635]  I was guilty to fight back against racist blacks.
[01:22:45.995 --> 01:22:47.196]  Now, are all blacks racist?
[01:22:47.256 --> 01:22:47.516]  No.
[01:22:49.818 --> 01:22:52.841]  But I mean, you know, there are racist blacks, there are racist Mexicans.
[01:22:53.161 --> 01:22:54.302]  There are racist Asians.
[01:22:56.204 --> 01:22:58.686]  To tell you the truth, the blacks and Hispanics really hate each other.
[01:22:58.906 --> 01:23:02.269]  I mean, why are we talking about all these real things that are going on?
[01:23:02.839 --> 01:23:06.144]  In the name of multiculturalism, they're training us all to be at each other's throats.
[01:23:06.384 --> 01:23:07.766]  Let's stop hating each other!
[01:23:07.786 --> 01:23:13.374]  And the answer would be, well, then don't talk about the plan from San Diego.
[01:23:13.715 --> 01:23:15.838]  Just wait till the killing starts, gringo.
[01:23:16.278 --> 01:23:17.400]  No, that's stupid!
[01:23:18.752 --> 01:23:22.033]  And by the way, it's not because I'm afraid you'll really launch your plan of San Diego.
[01:23:22.373 --> 01:23:23.413]  It just shows the hatred.
[01:23:23.833 --> 01:23:25.253]  The government's built FEMA camps.
[01:23:25.273 --> 01:23:27.574]  Do you know what they said in 86 the FEMA camps were for?
[01:23:27.974 --> 01:23:42.357]  They said they were going to wait for the illegal aliens to riot, which they're going to orchestrate, then they're going to throw a bunch of you in prisons, and then sell the racist white population, who, if they weren't racist before, they're going to be now,
[01:23:43.653 --> 01:23:47.174]  Against going along with having martial law.
[01:23:47.214 --> 01:23:49.094]  And then they're going to put the real political dissonance in.
[01:23:49.274 --> 01:23:50.655]  Did you know that's been declassified?
[01:23:51.155 --> 01:23:53.275]  Did you know the little plan that they're setting you up?
[01:23:53.315 --> 01:23:54.196]  It's real cute and funny.
[01:23:54.676 --> 01:23:59.837]  You know what happened when you listened to the Germans in 1918 and you attacked Texas and killed all those people?
[01:24:02.317 --> 01:24:03.978]  Thousands of Mexicans were slaughtered.
[01:24:04.318 --> 01:24:07.259]  They sent the Texas Rangers in and they just massacred a bunch of people.
[01:24:07.479 --> 01:24:08.299]  Which was wrong!
[01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:12.920]  You're being set up again!
[01:24:14.159 --> 01:24:15.579]  I don't want you to get killed.
[01:24:15.739 --> 01:24:16.719]  I don't want to get killed.
[01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:18.800]  I don't want to go to a FEMA camp, okay?
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:21.740]  Ted Turner says we can only have one kid.
[01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:23.421]  They want a one-child policy here.
[01:24:24.301 --> 01:24:25.241]  Do you know about eugenics?
[01:24:25.261 --> 01:24:26.881]  Do you know what they're doing to your food and water?
[01:24:28.362 --> 01:24:34.623]  Did you know that the Ford Foundation, Henry Ford, who funded Adolf Hitler, and was the top Nazi agent in the U.S.
[01:24:34.663 --> 01:24:38.263]  next to Prescott Bush, Bush's grandfather, did you know he funded you?
[01:24:39.444 --> 01:24:41.044]  Because it's the plan of San Diego.
[01:24:41.064 --> 01:24:42.064]  You're absolutely right it is.
[01:24:43.297 --> 01:24:44.698]  Very sophisticated.
[01:24:47.919 --> 01:24:49.560]  So I'm tired of feeling weird.
[01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:51.481]  I want to feel good around Hispanic people.
[01:24:51.521 --> 01:24:52.701]  They want to feel good around me.
[01:24:53.701 --> 01:24:58.424]  We want to do business together, live together, be friends, intermarry.
[01:24:58.664 --> 01:25:02.465]  The Czech and German communities all over Texas have intermarried with the Mexicans.
[01:25:02.745 --> 01:25:05.146]  They don't intermarry with each other, the Czechs and Poles and Germans.
[01:25:05.387 --> 01:25:07.047]  They don't intermarry, but they intermarry with the Mexicans.
[01:25:07.447 --> 01:25:08.748]  Nobody has anything against the Mexicans.
[01:25:10.246 --> 01:25:12.847]  35% of the signers of the Texas Constitution.
[01:25:13.268 --> 01:25:15.008]  The guy that wrote it was Juan Navarro.
[01:25:15.729 --> 01:25:18.410]  A Mexican wrote Texas Constitution!
[01:25:18.650 --> 01:25:20.670]  You've got a big seat at the table here!
[01:25:20.991 --> 01:25:21.911]  You're Texan!
[01:25:22.151 --> 01:25:23.932]  How have you let them take your heritage?
[01:25:26.193 --> 01:25:27.953]  How have you let them steal it from you?
[01:25:29.574 --> 01:25:31.675]  Texas is a lot cooler than Mexico!
[01:25:32.775 --> 01:25:34.976]  Texas is a lot more macho than Mexico!
[01:25:36.243 --> 01:25:36.903]  Because it is!
[01:25:36.983 --> 01:25:43.105]  It's got the Mexican, and the Spanish, and the German, and the French, and the Native American, and all of it mixed in!
[01:25:43.505 --> 01:25:44.105]  The black!
[01:25:46.885 --> 01:25:47.826]  It's a great place!
[01:25:48.686 --> 01:25:49.526]  I love Texas!
[01:25:49.566 --> 01:25:50.446]  God bless Texas!
[01:25:50.666 --> 01:25:51.526]  Let's be Texans!
[01:25:54.227 --> 01:25:57.448]  And we can all drink tequila and wear big ol' sombreros!
[01:25:57.528 --> 01:25:58.188]  I don't care!
[01:25:59.348 --> 01:26:03.169]  Just stop talking about how, and snickering about how you want to kill my family!
[01:26:04.028 --> 01:26:10.991]  I got videotape of 30,000 Mexicans while this guy's giving a speech about how he wants to kill us, and they're cheering.
[01:26:11.251 --> 01:26:12.392]  That is scary, man!
[01:26:12.572 --> 01:26:15.833]  You go out to some toothless Klan meeting, it's like 10 guys.
[01:26:17.174 --> 01:26:19.815]  Nobody supports them, and they're not even talking about stuff like that.
[01:26:20.335 --> 01:26:21.075]  And they're pathetic.
[01:26:22.496 --> 01:26:24.817]  Meanwhile, you got Fortune 500 funding this.
[01:26:26.358 --> 01:26:29.539]  You know, I said I'd take your calls, and I got Charlton Heston coming up.
[01:26:32.762 --> 01:26:33.523]  Let's go to Ventura now.
[01:26:33.543 --> 01:26:40.847]  I'm going to come back and take calls and then get into... Ventura came on, hit AP, national TV, local TV, foreign television, picked it up.
[01:26:40.867 --> 01:26:41.787]  Ventura came on my show.
[01:26:42.287 --> 01:26:44.949]  Fifty minutes of the interview during the break, he's like, Alex, I want to talk about 9-11.
[01:26:45.009 --> 01:26:47.310]  We're going to put those behind-the-scenes clips, by the way, up.
[01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:50.232]  And I said, okay, Jesse, I already interviewed you about a year and a half ago.
[01:26:50.272 --> 01:26:51.172]  You think the government let it happen?
[01:26:51.192 --> 01:26:52.233]  He goes, no, they did it.
[01:26:52.273 --> 01:26:53.033]  I want to talk about it.
[01:26:53.474 --> 01:26:54.094]  And then he laid it out.
[01:26:54.134 --> 01:26:54.634]  Here's Ventura.
[01:26:55.875 --> 01:26:57.416]  Governor Ventura, you've got the floor.
[01:26:57.476 --> 01:26:58.797]  Give us your take on 9-11.
[01:27:00.034 --> 01:27:02.175]  Well, first of all, Alex, let me state this.
[01:27:02.215 --> 01:27:13.801]  You know, being ex-military, when the attack initially took place and I was governor, I went on a very focused tunnel vision mode that our country had been attacked, and what the hell do we need to do to repel it?
[01:27:13.841 --> 01:27:22.865]  So, I today kick myself, because at that point in time, I had a position of power, and if I would have, you know, not been
[01:27:23.525 --> 01:27:41.931]  The way I was, the way all of us were so shocked when it happened, that in that position of power I could have raised a lot more questions at that time about the things that went down that day, and where today when I raise those questions naturally it doesn't quite have the impact that it would have had back then.
[01:27:42.731 --> 01:27:47.473]  But to me it's questions that are not being answered and haven't been answered about 9-11.
[01:27:48.973 --> 01:27:57.719]  And, you know, first and foremost, I think, is the fact that, okay, in New York City and Manhattan, two planes struck two buildings.
[01:28:06.504 --> 01:28:07.965]  I am back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:08.706 --> 01:28:09.126]  I am back.
[01:28:09.146 --> 01:28:10.407]  You know, we're playing that off YouTube.
[01:28:10.447 --> 01:28:13.268]  We edited down the hour and 20-minute interview to, like, 20 minutes.
[01:28:13.288 --> 01:28:14.129]  We're playing it off YouTube.
[01:28:14.622 --> 01:28:22.808]  And it's fully loaded, and it's just... I think the computer lines they have in here... But I've noticed my computer lines at my house used to be fast, and now they're slow.
[01:28:22.828 --> 01:28:25.690]  I think it's... I should start burning this on CD.
[01:28:25.790 --> 01:28:26.190]  You know what?
[01:28:26.230 --> 01:28:32.675]  We do have the interview with Heston on CD, so that will work nicely for you.
[01:28:32.955 --> 01:28:33.535]  It doesn't matter.
[01:28:33.575 --> 01:28:35.637]  We'll come back and play some more of it after the break.
[01:28:35.937 --> 01:28:44.223]  You can go to PrisonPlanet.com and watch the 20-minute boil-down, or we have an hour and 20-minute mp3 up there that everybody can watch.
[01:28:45.325 --> 01:28:47.553]  Other Ventura interview, it was unbelievable.
[01:28:47.573 --> 01:28:48.917]  He got into a bunch of other stuff too.
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:50.001]  Uh, Will...
[01:28:50.854 --> 01:28:58.080]  Hi, I'm David, and if you wake up at night to urinate like I was, then you'll want to take advantage of this special risk-free offer.
[01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:06.307]  If you have dribbling, burning, or pain during or after urination, then you may have a condition known as benign prostate enlargement.
[01:29:06.567 --> 01:29:16.035]  This is potentially serious and can get worse with age, so get regular checkups from your doctor and take advantage of this special risk-free offer on Beta Prostate.
[01:29:16.215 --> 01:29:20.759]  Beta-prostate contains natural ingredients that help support a healthy prostate.
[01:29:20.999 --> 01:29:26.423]  And it contains 3,000 times more beta-sinosterols than ordinary soft palmetto.
[01:29:26.663 --> 01:29:28.645]  So it's powerful and it works.
[01:29:29.005 --> 01:29:31.747]  What's better is that beta-prostate is a healthy supplement.
[01:29:31.968 --> 01:29:33.609]  So you don't need a prescription for it.
[01:29:33.849 --> 01:29:34.650]  And it's risk-free.
[01:29:34.950 --> 01:29:37.312]  For your risk-free trial of beta-prostate.
[01:29:37.492 --> 01:29:37.893]  Dial 1-800-457-9914.
[01:29:37.933 --> 01:29:38.153]  That's 1-800-457-9914.
[01:29:38.193 --> 01:29:39.055]  Try Beta Prostate Risk Free.
[01:29:39.075 --> 01:29:39.315]  That's 1-800-457-9914.
[01:29:50.345 --> 01:29:50.985]  It's a fact.
[01:29:51.205 --> 01:29:58.688]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[01:29:58.808 --> 01:30:07.671]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[01:30:07.931 --> 01:30:18.475]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:30:18.735 --> 01:30:24.798]  We can terminate your unsecure debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[01:30:25.018 --> 01:30:30.040]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[01:30:30.220 --> 01:30:34.702]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[01:30:34.862 --> 01:30:36.703]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[01:30:36.723 --> 01:30:36.983]  That's 877-943-8600.

[01:30:50.230 --> 01:31:03.018]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:31:03.359 --> 01:31:14.046]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:31:14.426 --> 01:31:17.589]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[01:31:17.829 --> 01:31:19.530]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[01:31:19.590 --> 01:31:25.335]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[01:31:31.140 --> 01:31:34.843]  While you're visiting the online video store, be sure to check out the huge discounts.
[01:31:35.103 --> 01:31:40.946]  On films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, America, Freedom to Fascism, and hundreds of other titles.
[01:31:41.347 --> 01:31:43.608]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[01:31:43.988 --> 01:31:49.331]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[01:31:49.851 --> 01:31:52.793]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:31:52.953 --> 01:31:58.156]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:31:58.476 --> 01:32:03.799]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:32:04.199 --> 01:32:05.300]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:32:05.660 --> 01:32:14.725]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:32:15.005 --> 01:32:16.606]  Now compare a cowbend pure soap.
[01:32:16.826 --> 01:32:25.651]  All natural, earth-friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing, they're safe, and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[01:32:26.052 --> 01:32:26.852]  Start saving over
[01:32:26.892 --> 01:32:27.652]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:33:29.757 --> 01:33:35.699]  I'm going to play some of that mature interview at the end of the show today.
[01:33:36.260 --> 01:33:39.481]  We're going to go to the Charlton Heston piece in a second.
[01:33:39.501 --> 01:33:43.002]  That's good music.
[01:33:43.763 --> 01:33:44.443]  Ha ha ha!
[01:33:46.944 --> 01:33:47.684]  I am radical.
[01:33:47.704 --> 01:33:56.868]  There's a huge secret plan that's totally public to kill me and everybody else of a certain race and talking about it's evil.
[01:33:58.301 --> 01:34:00.363]  Let's go ahead and take calls here.
[01:34:01.544 --> 01:34:03.245]  Let's talk to Aaron in Iowa.
[01:34:03.745 --> 01:34:04.566]  Aaron, you're on the air.
[01:34:04.626 --> 01:34:06.067]  Thanks for holding while I've been ranting.
[01:34:06.327 --> 01:34:07.068]  No problem at all.
[01:34:07.588 --> 01:34:08.108]  What's on your mind?
[01:34:08.749 --> 01:34:12.051]  First of all, I just want to say that I would go to the limit to call this an honor to be talking to you right now.
[01:34:12.071 --> 01:34:13.833]  I appreciate what you've been doing and what you have been doing.
[01:34:14.073 --> 01:34:15.274]  Well, thanks for putting up with me.
[01:34:15.294 --> 01:34:15.914]  What's on your mind?
[01:34:16.474 --> 01:34:18.276]  I have two things I want to talk about.
[01:34:18.296 --> 01:34:26.902]  I just want to talk about a couple weeks ago, I was in one of my community college classes and the professor showed a bowling for Columbine with Michael Moore.
[01:34:27.631 --> 01:34:30.033]  Yes, where Moore tries to set up Heston.
[01:34:30.473 --> 01:34:40.199]  Yeah, where he just ambushes him, and he says that Heston has never been a victim of any assault or any crime whatsoever, and he was questioning why he would have a loaded gun in his house.
[01:34:41.460 --> 01:34:44.081]  And, I mean, I just wanted to say that.
[01:34:45.642 --> 01:34:53.868]  Well, the establishment wants to disarm the people, so they pose as liberals, and once they've got us disarmed like they are in Mexico or Russia or Nazi Germany, we can be good little slaves.
[01:34:56.226 --> 01:35:01.911]  And what better way to ban our guns than to instigate some race war in the United States instead of us all living in peace?
[01:35:02.251 --> 01:35:09.738]  Yeah, I mean, it might sound crazy to say, but the global elite have wide open borders to spark a revolution.
[01:35:09.858 --> 01:35:10.719]  No, that's what they want.
[01:35:10.739 --> 01:35:13.762]  And then the countries, they have handbooks on it, tear each other apart.
[01:35:14.062 --> 01:35:15.423]  I want to live in peace with everybody.
[01:35:15.864 --> 01:35:18.586]  Yeah, and you said earlier that people call you weak for being friendly.
[01:35:19.026 --> 01:35:20.588]  I mean, I'm sick and tired of that.
[01:35:21.652 --> 01:35:23.273]  No, no, that's the thing.
[01:35:23.313 --> 01:35:30.837]  You've got to act weak, be friendly, and be told, we hate you, we don't want you, and then you can't even say, hey, that's mean, because then you're racist if you do.
[01:35:32.357 --> 01:35:39.281]  When I was talking to Trey, he plays in a band, and he says all the time, and I've experienced it, out at night, folks will pull up and say, hey, Gringo, we want to kill you.
[01:35:39.581 --> 01:35:40.682]  Come on, say something, do something.
[01:35:40.702 --> 01:35:47.865]  There'll be guns waving out windows, and it's just like, but if you get shot or stabbed or killed down on 6th Street, it's just, oh, somebody got killed.
[01:35:47.925 --> 01:35:48.805]  It's never racial.
[01:35:49.086 --> 01:35:49.606]  Well, it is.
[01:35:50.751 --> 01:35:52.331]  But see, it's okay to kill gringo.
[01:35:52.592 --> 01:35:55.052]  That's the only racial murders and killings allowed.
[01:35:55.252 --> 01:35:56.092]  And I'm sick of it.
[01:35:56.953 --> 01:35:57.833]  I am sick of it.
[01:35:58.153 --> 01:35:58.953]  I am tired of it.
[01:35:59.313 --> 01:36:02.314]  I don't call in my household Mexicans' racist names.
[01:36:03.314 --> 01:36:03.915]  You understand that?
[01:36:04.075 --> 01:36:04.895]  I am above that.
[01:36:05.835 --> 01:36:07.816]  But that means I'm also above what they're doing.
[01:36:07.896 --> 01:36:08.956]  And that doesn't mean all.
[01:36:10.156 --> 01:36:13.157]  Just like all whites don't need to be lumped in with the Ku Klux Klan.
[01:36:14.137 --> 01:36:17.818]  But the Ku Klux Klan's not being funded by HBO and Absolute Vodka.
[01:36:18.819 --> 01:36:20.159]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:36:21.021 --> 01:36:22.642]  Let's talk to Sean in Wisconsin.
[01:36:22.662 --> 01:36:24.162]  He says he's angry with me.
[01:36:24.602 --> 01:36:24.823]  Okay.
[01:36:24.863 --> 01:36:26.863]  Hey, Alex.
[01:36:26.943 --> 01:36:29.044]  Actually, this is Sean's girlfriend, Jen.
[01:36:29.064 --> 01:36:29.705]  How are you doing today?
[01:36:29.725 --> 01:36:29.945]  Good.
[01:36:29.985 --> 01:36:31.545]  Thanks for holding while I went through that rant.
[01:36:32.006 --> 01:36:33.266]  Oh, it's quite all right, dude.
[01:36:33.286 --> 01:36:33.846]  I understand.
[01:36:34.787 --> 01:36:40.109]  Listen, I just want to say I really respect what you're doing here, and we've listened to your... Well, that's okay.
[01:36:40.129 --> 01:36:41.309]  What do you disagree with me about?
[01:36:42.170 --> 01:36:45.031]  Oh, well, I guess I don't really disagree.
[01:36:45.051 --> 01:36:50.033]  I was just a little taken back when you were discussing earth-based religions.
[01:36:51.150 --> 01:37:00.758]  And it's not that I know what you're getting at, but I do feel that... I just, when the shit hits the fan, I don't want some... Ma'am?
[01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:06.182]  Look, I don't want to hang up on you, but if you cuss, I gotta hang up on you, okay?
[01:37:06.602 --> 01:37:08.784]  The lady called in, and I had to delay her out.
[01:37:08.844 --> 01:37:11.686]  Please don't email me saying, We didn't hear cussing, you're a liar!
[01:37:11.947 --> 01:37:12.827]  There's a delay!
[01:37:12.847 --> 01:37:14.989]  Okay, I delayed her out.
[01:37:15.730 --> 01:37:18.532]  Ma'am, I wanted to hear what you had to say, but you talked about the...
[01:37:19.059 --> 01:37:24.441]  Horseman error hitting the oscillating device.
[01:37:27.182 --> 01:37:31.103]  Because I was talking about earth-based religions wanting to exterminate 80% of the population.
[01:37:32.524 --> 01:37:39.866]  That is not what I said on Coast to Coast AM, Thursday night, with George Norrie in the first hour, in the news hour.
[01:37:41.297 --> 01:37:53.385]  What I said was, is that the brand of earth-based religion that Ted Turner and the UN follows, and Dr. Eric Pianca follows at UT, and he's on the UT website, dressed up like a druid, talking about Lucifer.
[01:37:53.685 --> 01:37:55.266]  You cannot make this type of stuff up.
[01:37:55.306 --> 01:37:59.629]  He's the one that says he wants 90% of us to die and get standing ovations at the Texas Academy of Sciences.
[01:38:00.470 --> 01:38:05.393]  I was on there because Ted Turner was saying, too many people, we've got to forcibly only have, you know, one child.
[01:38:06.094 --> 01:38:09.036]  Well, he said it needs to be voluntary, but then that's how China started.
[01:38:09.076 --> 01:38:09.576]  That's my point.
[01:38:10.945 --> 01:38:11.966]  That's what they're pushing.
[01:38:12.407 --> 01:38:16.030]  And so their brand of earth-based religion says humans are bad and need to be killed.
[01:38:16.491 --> 01:38:20.355]  I know that a lot of the other brands of it don't say that.
[01:38:22.497 --> 01:38:25.140]  Just like there's different brands of Christianity that believe different things.
[01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:26.962]  I'm not going to get into a religious debate.
[01:38:27.903 --> 01:38:32.868]  So I was not saying that your brand of Gaia worship or whatever it is
[01:38:33.655 --> 01:38:36.776]  Or animism, is wanting to kill all the humans.
[01:38:36.916 --> 01:38:50.321]  But, you can't ignore that in Druid culture in Europe, which was degenerate, at least some of it was in my opinion, in the Aztec culture, again I'm saying both cultures, you've got a white culture, you've got an Asian culture, and that's what they are.
[01:38:50.561 --> 01:38:58.344]  It's Asians that passed over the land bridge 35,000 years ago, cutting their children's hearts out for Earth as a sacrifice, I think is bad.
[01:38:59.505 --> 01:39:06.788]  Now, I know that most of the modern earth worship stuff doesn't do that, but most earth worship, even in the ancient Greeks, culminated in human sacrifice.
[01:39:07.668 --> 01:39:08.989]  Okay, now I think that's wrong.
[01:39:10.009 --> 01:39:11.950]  And UN documents talk about how they're pushing that.
[01:39:14.031 --> 01:39:18.273]  Let's go ahead and talk to Satanya in Oregon.
[01:39:18.293 --> 01:39:18.713]  You're on the air.
[01:39:18.793 --> 01:39:19.293]  Thanks for holding.
[01:39:20.233 --> 01:39:20.814]  Hi, Alex.
[01:39:21.154 --> 01:39:22.034]  Pleasure to talk to you.
[01:39:22.134 --> 01:39:22.374]  You bet.
[01:39:22.394 --> 01:39:22.894]  What's on your mind?
[01:39:23.234 --> 01:39:26.856]  A few weeks ago you said something about Barack Obama.
[01:39:27.663 --> 01:39:29.564]  I'm not being confronted.
[01:39:29.584 --> 01:39:31.225]  Well, I'm 14.
[01:39:31.845 --> 01:39:39.509]  I decided to go down to Corvallis, a town here in Oregon, and Barack Obama was there, so I went and confronted him.
[01:39:39.789 --> 01:39:40.849]  Did you get some video of that?
[01:39:41.270 --> 01:39:42.230]  I didn't get a video.
[01:39:42.250 --> 01:39:42.830]  That's okay.
[01:39:43.050 --> 01:39:44.591]  It would be great to put it on YouTube.
[01:39:45.051 --> 01:39:45.311]  Yeah.
[01:39:45.372 --> 01:39:46.352]  So what'd you confront him about?
[01:39:46.392 --> 01:39:47.633]  How he's pushing a one-world government?
[01:39:48.293 --> 01:39:50.434]  Yeah, and about him being in the CFR.
[01:39:51.014 --> 01:39:56.877]  Well, that's the problem, is that he doesn't have all the baggage of the other candidates, so you want to like him, and I like him as a person.
[01:39:57.284 --> 01:40:00.126]  The problem is he's handled by the very same people that handle Hillary.
[01:40:00.746 --> 01:40:05.049]  Yeah, well, um, he like, you know, uh, he didn't really talk to me.
[01:40:05.090 --> 01:40:06.250]  I just started yelling at him.
[01:40:06.851 --> 01:40:08.492]  And, uh, it's pretty good.
[01:40:09.012 --> 01:40:19.259]  I talked to about 50 people and, um, and like a bunch of them knew about the, the vote fraud and a few of them turned to Ron Paul.
[01:40:21.121 --> 01:40:21.921]  Well, good job.
[01:40:22.422 --> 01:40:22.662]  Yeah.
[01:40:22.902 --> 01:40:24.183]  And also, um,
[01:40:24.693 --> 01:40:27.274]  I wanted to say hi to someone that's speaking.
[01:40:27.434 --> 01:40:28.155]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:40:29.195 --> 01:40:31.396]  Hi to my mom and Guten Tag, Keisha.
[01:40:32.097 --> 01:40:33.257]  Okay, you're awesome.
[01:40:34.137 --> 01:40:35.278]  I love having the young people listen.
[01:40:35.938 --> 01:40:42.561]  You know, I wanted to talk about Chuck Heston, Charlton Heston for like 30 minutes today.
[01:40:43.382 --> 01:40:44.882]  And I'm just not going to have time to do it.
[01:40:44.983 --> 01:40:46.563]  And then next week, nobody's going to care.
[01:40:46.603 --> 01:40:47.984]  People forget about folks that die.
[01:40:48.004 --> 01:40:51.346]  It's just that I interviewed him, I talked to him a few times off air.
[01:40:51.366 --> 01:40:52.306]  He was such a gentleman.
[01:40:52.754 --> 01:40:53.254]  So nice.
[01:40:53.314 --> 01:40:54.735]  He really did care about the Second Amendment.
[01:40:55.095 --> 01:40:56.615]  The NRA is compromised.
[01:40:56.655 --> 01:40:57.516]  Does compromise.
[01:40:58.016 --> 01:40:59.636]  But I'm not going to blame Charlton Heston for that.
[01:40:59.676 --> 01:41:02.838]  He really did help educate folks about the Second Amendment.
[01:41:04.058 --> 01:41:05.859]  And he is dead now, of course.
[01:41:06.319 --> 01:41:07.199]  Died last night.
[01:41:07.919 --> 01:41:09.520]  Clearly complications from Alzheimer's.
[01:41:09.820 --> 01:41:11.841]  He'd had pneumonia last year and almost died.
[01:41:13.181 --> 01:41:16.022]  And just such an icon.
[01:41:17.263 --> 01:41:18.603]  But he was in the civil rights movement.
[01:41:20.322 --> 01:41:32.709]  Back in the early sixties when it was unpopular to do it, he got boycotted over it, a lot of things happened, and then he got called names and attacked by the quote left because he said, well, I'm still for civil rights, and it's our right to own guns and defend ourselves.
[01:41:33.889 --> 01:41:38.432]  And he did so many other great things, and now he's dead, he's gone on.
[01:41:39.552 --> 01:41:43.114]  So I'm going to come back and play a little bit of that.
[01:41:44.975 --> 01:41:46.716]  What an amazing week this week!
[01:41:46.997 --> 01:41:49.438]  Chuck Heston died, and then of course I interviewed
[01:41:50.305 --> 01:42:00.088]  Jesse Ventura, some of the other things he broke on my show, that he, over 20 publishers refused his book, even though he had three other bestsellers, New York Times bestsellers, because it did criticize the government.
[01:42:00.768 --> 01:42:02.149]  He said it was mockingbird, you know.
[01:42:02.389 --> 01:42:08.350]  He also talked about the CIA covertly trying to basically take over his administration.
[01:42:08.711 --> 01:42:14.352]  His first week in office as governor, there were 23 CIA people in the basement of his office.
[01:42:15.092 --> 01:42:17.613]  There, in a clandestine op that was illegal.
[01:42:17.893 --> 01:42:18.914]  Every major city's run by them.
[01:42:18.934 --> 01:42:20.014]  They run the narcotics, everything.
[01:42:20.755 --> 01:42:21.755]  He broke that on the show.
[01:42:21.775 --> 01:42:29.418]  He also talked about how Obama, that the people will try to assassinate him if he's for real, and he really tries to get us out of this war.
[01:42:29.438 --> 01:42:32.539]  So that's some of the stuff that Jesse Ventura talked about.
[01:42:32.599 --> 01:42:35.000]  Again, that interview is up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:39.441]  We'll come back, play a Chuck Heston clip, maybe take a few calls.
[01:42:39.481 --> 01:42:39.861]  Stay with us.
[01:42:50.273 --> 01:42:51.954]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:42:52.274 --> 01:42:55.695]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:42:55.875 --> 01:42:57.735]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:42:58.056 --> 01:43:01.117]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:43:01.417 --> 01:43:06.919]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:43:07.199 --> 01:43:11.140]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[01:43:51.113 --> 01:43:54.495]  I am Dr. Buell Von Scheich with the White Paper Comicals.
[01:43:54.735 --> 01:44:03.099]  Mr. Steve Scheich with this fearless radio program is correct when he says the solution to our difficult times is to store food and get healthy.
[01:44:03.419 --> 01:44:06.481]  My comrades and I of the media don't want you to panic.
[01:44:06.801 --> 01:44:15.747]  We, unlike Fearless Radio, try not to tell you about the food control legislation, Hurricane Katrina, the American Famine, families unable to buy food.
[01:44:16.047 --> 01:44:23.933]  If we told you the solution to all these problems is food, you'd panic and run out and buy a food before it disappeared, or you couldn't afford it.
[01:44:24.233 --> 01:44:30.577]  You'd completely mess up the perfect strategy for population control, and they'd kick us out of the Survivors Club.
[01:44:30.757 --> 01:44:35.781]  You are a sissy chicken if you call JMSEfoodsDirect.com and order food.
[01:44:36.201 --> 01:44:36.782]  This is Steve.
[01:44:37.243 --> 01:44:38.745]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[01:44:38.765 --> 01:44:38.805]  800-409-5633.
[01:44:38.905 --> 01:44:42.731]  You'd be considered a little bit crazy, but there's no such thing as a little bit dead.
[01:44:50.532 --> 01:44:51.993]  America needs Ron Paul.
[01:44:52.213 --> 01:44:53.274]  He needs your support.
[01:44:53.514 --> 01:44:54.495]  The time is now.
[01:44:54.896 --> 01:44:58.759]  As long as he has your support, he will continue to fight until the very end.
[01:44:59.099 --> 01:45:03.202]  We know that many people would like to show their support, but want to do it on a larger scale.
[01:45:03.522 --> 01:45:09.467]  RonPaulFlags.com produces the most beautiful flags dedicated to electing the only man fit to be president.
[01:45:09.807 --> 01:45:14.391]  Standard flags are 3 feet by 5 feet, and custom flags can be as large as 30 feet by 50 feet.
[01:45:15.572 --> 01:45:20.595]  Our most popular flags are Ron Paul, President in 08, and Ron Paul Revolution.
[01:45:20.875 --> 01:45:28.320]  These flags work perfectly mounted on homes, RVs, at barbecues, outdoor rallies, picnics, NASCAR races, and meet-up groups.

[01:45:36.746 --> 01:45:37.186]  That's 731-664-1526.
[01:45:37.206 --> 01:45:37.706]  Do something!
[01:45:43.630 --> 01:45:47.873]  Stand up for the only man worthy of restoring our country to how our forefathers envisioned.

[01:45:50.652 --> 01:45:54.033]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:45:54.173 --> 01:45:59.374]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:45:59.574 --> 01:46:04.355]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:46:04.715 --> 01:46:15.838]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:46:16.238 --> 01:46:21.784]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:46:22.025 --> 01:46:28.091]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:46:28.292 --> 01:46:28.932]  What about you?
[01:46:29.333 --> 01:46:31.235]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.

[01:46:56.993 --> 01:46:59.254]  You're listening to the GCN Radio Network.
[01:47:05.243 --> 01:47:06.704]  All right, it's the final segment.
[01:47:06.744 --> 01:47:11.706]  Two hours just isn't enough for this show, but if I expand the number of hours I do here, my wife will probably kill me.
[01:47:11.766 --> 01:47:14.288]  And I drag my ugly hind end in here.
[01:47:17.289 --> 01:47:18.750]  On Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:47:18.790 --> 01:47:20.131]  Central, 5 to 7 p.m.
[01:47:20.931 --> 01:47:22.632]  Eastern, we do the show live.
[01:47:22.652 --> 01:47:23.652]  2 to 4 p.m.
[01:47:23.692 --> 01:47:26.334]  Pacific.
[01:47:26.454 --> 01:47:28.695]  I'm gonna leave the mountain out.
[01:47:28.715 --> 01:47:29.175]  3 to 5 p.m.
[01:47:29.215 --> 01:47:29.475]  Mountain.
[01:47:30.896 --> 01:47:32.877]  And I want everybody to know, I love y'all.
[01:47:34.249 --> 01:47:42.055]  I mean, who can look at a little white child, a black child, a Hispanic child, an Asian child, and not want them to have great opportunities and a great life?
[01:47:43.315 --> 01:47:43.596]  Who?
[01:47:46.318 --> 01:47:48.179]  No, I care about everybody.
[01:47:49.460 --> 01:47:56.525]  But see, race has such power because then when other people are racist to you... And I know people have been real racist to the Mexicans.
[01:47:57.165 --> 01:47:58.746]  And so now they get real racist.
[01:47:59.127 --> 01:48:00.007]  That's just how it works.
[01:48:00.047 --> 01:48:02.169]  But the point is, we've got to stop this someday.
[01:48:03.895 --> 01:48:12.520]  And this ignoring what's happened with the La Reconquista crowd has let it really develop and grow and get big.
[01:48:14.241 --> 01:48:15.241]  And it's very destructive.
[01:48:16.882 --> 01:48:21.645]  You know, it's all coming out now and what it's going to do is it's going to hurt a lot of Hispanic businesses.
[01:48:23.506 --> 01:48:27.008]  Because whites, blacks and others aren't going to know if they're welcome.
[01:48:27.028 --> 01:48:29.469]  And aren't going to know if they're wanted there.
[01:48:29.649 --> 01:48:29.889]  I know
[01:48:32.648 --> 01:48:35.930]  You know, I go places sometimes and it's not welcome now and I just don't come back.
[01:48:36.250 --> 01:48:39.072]  And I remember hearing that black folks always feeling not welcome at restaurants.
[01:48:39.112 --> 01:48:40.173]  Maybe they were paranoid sometimes.
[01:48:40.473 --> 01:48:41.714]  Maybe they were right some of the time.
[01:48:42.595 --> 01:48:44.576]  I mean, I'm starting to experience that.
[01:48:44.596 --> 01:48:46.397]  It's really sad.
[01:48:46.997 --> 01:48:47.598]  Okay, look.
[01:48:48.679 --> 01:48:49.599]  Here's Chuck Heston.
[01:48:49.719 --> 01:48:50.640]  It's a 20-minute interview.
[01:48:50.660 --> 01:48:52.001]  I'm only going to play about 5 minutes of it.
[01:48:52.781 --> 01:48:56.103]  Sometime during the week, probably tomorrow, I'm going to air the whole thing on the weekday show.
[01:48:56.123 --> 01:48:58.265]  I've got a big announcement I'm making, by the way, in the second hour tomorrow.
[01:48:58.285 --> 01:49:00.386]  You'll be able to see it in text by 12.30 tomorrow.
[01:49:02.244 --> 01:49:04.526]  In the afternoon it will be posted up on Infowars.com.
[01:49:04.566 --> 01:49:05.246]  Huge announcement.
[01:49:05.767 --> 01:49:06.908]  We'll just let you see what that is.
[01:49:07.428 --> 01:49:09.970]  But right now here is Charlton Heston.
[01:49:10.511 --> 01:49:12.952]  My interview with him seven years ago, January 18, 2001.
[01:49:18.537 --> 01:49:29.926]  And again, you can also read the transcript of the interview up on Infowars.com.
[01:49:31.601 --> 01:49:35.303]  Here is Chuck Heston, who died yesterday at 84 in Los Angeles.
[01:49:36.523 --> 01:49:37.884]  And I don't say that lightly.
[01:49:37.904 --> 01:49:53.311]  I mean, everybody knows who Charlton Heston is, and it really made the socialist in-the-culture war, as Mr. Heston calls it, angry when he stepped up to the plate a couple years ago, back into the Second Amendment fight, and now his new book is amazing, The Courage to be Free.
[01:49:53.911 --> 01:49:55.892]  Mr. Heston, thank you for joining us today.
[01:49:55.912 --> 01:49:57.973]  Well, thank you for loaning me your audience.
[01:49:57.993 --> 01:49:59.194]  It's a pleasure to talk to you.
[01:49:59.554 --> 01:50:00.194]  You bet.
[01:50:00.234 --> 01:50:07.817]  Why did you decide to get back really involved in the Second Amendment fight at the forefront and to write this new book, The Courage to Be Free?
[01:50:08.258 --> 01:50:14.620]  Well, of course, I've been involved with the Second Amendment, you could say, since I was a little kid shooting deer up in Michigan.
[01:50:17.054 --> 01:50:32.508]  Then I became involved more seriously with the Bill of Rights, and I came to see the importance of defending every one of the twelve articles of the Bill of Rights, of which the second is the right to keep and bear harms.
[01:50:32.889 --> 01:50:36.932]  And we had a lot of success with it in the last election.
[01:50:37.733 --> 01:50:38.814]  There's an interesting thing.
[01:50:38.834 --> 01:50:41.717]  The President last April,
[01:50:42.677 --> 01:50:48.698]  Felt that this would be a good time to take down the NRA.
[01:50:48.718 --> 01:50:55.239]  And he made a couple of brief radio addresses about it and so on.
[01:50:55.960 --> 01:50:57.840]  But he realized it wasn't going to fly.
[01:50:58.660 --> 01:50:59.860]  And so he abandoned it.
[01:51:00.981 --> 01:51:08.622]  And of course, what he didn't realize, as we found ourselves rather amazed to find,
[01:51:09.415 --> 01:51:23.959]  When I was campaigning through, what, eight different states and several different cities, and what the president has not realized is not just the NRA.
[01:51:24.079 --> 01:51:26.960]  The NRA has, what, just under 5,000 members.
[01:51:28.960 --> 01:51:30.661]  I'm sorry, 5 million.
[01:51:31.661 --> 01:51:32.361]  And we
[01:51:35.558 --> 01:51:51.905]  A campaign on this issue, in part because of course, as again, the President did not realize that an overwhelming proportion of people in this country are hunters.
[01:51:51.925 --> 01:51:53.406]  Of course they are.
[01:51:53.686 --> 01:51:54.746]  This is hunting country.
[01:51:54.786 --> 01:51:57.427]  The whole continent is a hunting continent.
[01:51:58.488 --> 01:52:00.829]  Except for New York City and L.A., of course.
[01:52:02.086 --> 01:52:05.967]  And we had enormous success.
[01:52:06.727 --> 01:52:08.908]  We would gather crowds.
[01:52:08.928 --> 01:52:11.088]  Flint, Michigan, I think, was the biggest one.
[01:52:11.868 --> 01:52:24.832]  We had a rally at 7 o'clock in the morning, which meant people who were going to work, of course, driving to work, had to get up to come at 6 o'clock.
[01:52:25.752 --> 01:52:30.593]  And we had over 3,000 people in some different venues.
[01:52:31.574 --> 01:52:37.063]  And in every case, the Second Amendment won the day.
[01:52:37.363 --> 01:52:39.607]  It was quite surprising, I have to say.
[01:52:40.367 --> 01:52:53.830]  Well, we see the mainstream media, the controlled propaganda arms is what I call them, and I think they've shown themselves to deserve that title, convincing a lot of people that the average American isn't for the Second Amendment.
[01:52:53.850 --> 01:53:07.213]  But if you can explain to people the basics of how it's there to defend us from the street thug, the government thug, or to put food on the table, not to mention just as a sporting enjoyment and heritage, most people are actually for it.
[01:53:08.428 --> 01:53:10.889]  John Ashcroft right now, they're trying to confirm him.
[01:53:10.929 --> 01:53:15.391]  I think he would be a good... I think he will be confirmed.
[01:53:15.411 --> 01:53:18.632]  I think he will make a fine Attorney General.
[01:53:18.692 --> 01:53:20.993]  Certainly a far better one than Janet Reno.
[01:53:21.373 --> 01:53:24.375]  But absolutely, that wouldn't be too hard to do.
[01:53:24.495 --> 01:53:32.378]  But Mr. Kennedy, who I really don't think has any room to talk, with all the skeletons in his closet, began to attack him.
[01:53:32.398 --> 01:53:33.618]  There's no one in the U.S.
[01:53:33.698 --> 01:53:34.539]  Senate that has more...
[01:53:35.419 --> 01:53:38.361]  More skeletons in his closet than Kennedy.
[01:53:38.641 --> 01:53:40.042]  He should be ashamed of himself.
[01:53:40.102 --> 01:53:40.842]  He really should.
[01:53:40.942 --> 01:53:43.144]  I worked for his older brother.
[01:53:43.964 --> 01:53:45.145]  I voted for him.
[01:53:45.465 --> 01:53:46.606]  I campaigned for him.
[01:53:48.126 --> 01:53:51.228]  But Teddy Kennedy is another piece of work entirely.
[01:53:53.229 --> 01:53:57.752]  But anyway, to return to the question of the Second Amendment,
[01:53:59.189 --> 01:54:05.070]  There are, for example, now 41 states that have concealed carry laws.
[01:54:05.830 --> 01:54:24.814]  Meaning that if you pass a background check, show that you have no felony convictions of any kind, show that you demonstrate that you know how to use a firearm safely, you can then get a permit to carry a concealed carry weapon under your arm or wherever.
[01:54:25.829 --> 01:54:26.130]  I don't
[01:54:45.394 --> 01:54:47.316]  The murder rate, the crime rate, too.
[01:54:47.856 --> 01:54:48.938]  Never mind the murder rate.
[01:54:48.978 --> 01:54:52.081]  The crime rate has dropped significantly.
[01:54:52.641 --> 01:54:54.924]  Significantly in every one of those states.
[01:54:55.565 --> 01:54:55.945]  Why?
[01:54:56.786 --> 01:55:01.351]  Because, of course, most people who have this permit don't carry all the time.
[01:55:02.031 --> 01:55:05.375]  But the point is, the bad guys don't know who's carrying and who isn't.
[01:55:06.292 --> 01:55:09.755]  So that is, of course, you don't need to have to carry them.
[01:55:23.906 --> 01:55:24.626]  It does indeed.
[01:55:24.766 --> 01:55:36.209]  Kennedy attacked him on the Second Amendment because, of course, Ashcroft is pro-Second Amendment, pro-Constitution Bill of Rights, and he said, how dare you say that these guns are here to defend us from tyranny in government?
[01:55:36.529 --> 01:55:44.331]  Well, it turned out that Ashcroft's actual quote was basically paraphrasing Thomas Jefferson, so how dare Kennedy?
[01:55:44.371 --> 01:55:45.272]  Any comments on that?
[01:55:46.572 --> 01:55:49.933]  You know, I have to say, much as I admired his big brother,
[01:55:50.766 --> 01:55:55.969]  I think Teddy Kennedy is one of the worst members of the U.S.
[01:55:56.190 --> 01:55:56.550]  Senate.
[01:55:57.651 --> 01:55:58.051]  You know what?
[01:55:58.091 --> 01:56:01.053]  Tomorrow I'm going to air all 20 minutes of the interview on the weekday show.
[01:56:01.073 --> 01:56:01.833]  You'll be able to hear it there.
[01:56:01.873 --> 01:56:02.974]  This is nowhere on the web.
[01:56:03.034 --> 01:56:04.515]  This interview is forgotten, lost.
[01:56:04.935 --> 01:56:06.276]  It has now been found.
[01:56:06.356 --> 01:56:10.599]  I dug through heaps of CDs and things angrily today at the office and found it.
[01:56:11.219 --> 01:56:13.341]  Now remember, Ashcroft hadn't been confirmed.
[01:56:13.481 --> 01:56:15.082]  Bush wasn't even in office yet.
[01:56:16.872 --> 01:56:19.953]  Remember, Bush officially got into office January 22nd.
[01:56:20.233 --> 01:56:21.893]  This is four days before Bush got in.
[01:56:22.533 --> 01:56:34.776]  To show I've been fair, I was thinking Ashcroft talked about Clinton spying on people without warrants, how evil he was, how the second amendment was absolute, and then he got in there, and now Bush has tried to pass gun bills.
[01:56:35.596 --> 01:56:40.597]  So, kind of embarrassing me, in hindsight, after how bad Ashcroft turned out to be.
[01:56:40.957 --> 01:56:44.618]  But I tried to give Bush benefit of the doubt, and it turned out
[01:56:45.222 --> 01:56:46.103]  Very, very bad indeed.
[01:56:46.123 --> 01:56:51.767]  But we get into a bunch of other police state and new world order issues in the 15 minutes or so that you haven't heard.
[01:56:52.488 --> 01:56:55.991]  And we'll also be posting that on YouTube in the next few days in its entirety with some images.
[01:56:56.611 --> 01:57:00.274]  It'll be up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:57:01.435 --> 01:57:02.416]  Sorry to all the callers.
[01:57:03.657 --> 01:57:05.759]  Next weekend I'll take more calls, I promise.
[01:57:05.779 --> 01:57:08.981]  I did the last few weeks, but today we just had too much news.
[01:57:09.702 --> 01:57:14.906]  And to everybody out there, there are just a few thousand global elitists
[01:57:15.578 --> 01:57:19.720]  They are trying to keep us all at each other's throats, divide and conquer so they can control us.
[01:57:21.281 --> 01:57:25.643]  And I'm begging everybody out there, whether you're black, white, Hispanic, Asian, it doesn't matter.
[01:57:26.123 --> 01:57:32.866]  Big foundations, big money, in the name of multiculturalism are actually trying to turn us against each other so that we can
[01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:41.502]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:57:41.622 --> 01:57:46.423]  Over the years, Genesis Communications Network has grown by leaps and bounds, reaching millions of listeners.
[01:57:46.543 --> 01:57:49.424]  The impact on political and social issues have been enormous.
[01:57:49.564 --> 01:57:53.565]  Businesses associated with the network have grown to become valuable enterprises.
[01:57:53.885 --> 01:57:59.846]  If you are accredited and have an entrepreneurial spirit, national radio may be the opportunity you're looking for.
[01:58:00.086 --> 01:58:01.649]  Call me today at 877-996-4327, extension 101.
[01:58:01.830 --> 01:58:04.054]  For more information, that's 877-996-4327, extension 101.
[01:58:11.601 --> 01:58:12.582]  Looking for profit?
[01:58:12.662 --> 01:58:14.063]  Looking for safety and security?
[01:58:14.503 --> 01:58:17.605]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[01:58:17.645 --> 01:58:25.209]  This low-mintage collector coin, with a total series mintage under $600,000, has sold at four times its current price.
[01:58:25.269 --> 01:58:28.992]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[01:58:29.032 --> 01:58:30.533]  Secure your position today.
[01:58:30.853 --> 01:58:32.094]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:58:32.114 --> 01:58:32.334]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:58:40.498 --> 01:58:42.639]  All you men out there, you need to listen up.
[01:58:42.959 --> 01:58:48.122]  By the age of 60, 1 in 2 men already have a prostate-related health issue.
[01:58:48.262 --> 01:58:48.942]  What does this mean?
[01:58:49.222 --> 01:58:54.945]  It might be an enlarged prostate, difficulty going to the bathroom, and a diminished sex drive.
[01:58:55.205 --> 01:58:56.206]  Not a pretty picture.
[01:58:56.486 --> 01:59:00.448]  If you're a man, you need to give your body nutrition to support prostate health.
[01:59:00.748 --> 01:59:01.808]  There's no question about it.
[01:59:01.848 --> 01:59:06.751]  Many people hear this and they might think Saw Paul Meadow, but there's something so much better out there.
[01:59:07.111 --> 01:59:13.515]  It's called Beta Prostate, and it contains 3,000 times more healthy plant sterols than ordinary saw palmetto.
[01:59:13.675 --> 01:59:17.197]  So before you try anything else, try Beta Prostate.
[01:59:17.637 --> 01:59:20.198]  Ignoring your prostate's not going to make the problems go away.
[01:59:20.498 --> 01:59:25.261]  Taking Beta Prostate is guaranteed to provide effective, all-natural support.
[01:59:25.281 --> 01:59:25.601]  Dial 1-800-457-9914.
[01:59:25.641 --> 01:59:25.921]  That's 1-800-457-9914.
[01:59:25.941 --> 01:59:29.083]  Call now and find out how you can get a free bottle of Beta Prostate with your order.
[01:59:36.107 --> 01:59:36.387]  Dial 1-800-457-9914.
