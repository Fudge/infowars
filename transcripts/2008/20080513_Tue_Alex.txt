[00:00:05.592 --> 00:00:06.233]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.914 --> 00:00:07.955]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.676 --> 00:00:09.777]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.438 --> 00:00:11.239]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.861]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.582 --> 00:00:17.286]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:21.811]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:29.873]  Robert Galen Ross is in studio with us for the next hour and a half, maybe even longer than Tony Gosling from England.
[00:00:30.294 --> 00:00:33.238]  Has the Bilderberg Group already met in Athens, Greece?
[00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:35.961]  That's what a Greek newspaper is reporting.
[00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:37.744]  We'll see if that's true or a false start.
[00:00:38.084 --> 00:00:47.096]  We know they have steering committee meetings that have thrown people off six years ago, and it's happened before that as well, where they were having a steering committee with about 25-30 members.
[00:00:47.356 --> 00:00:50.981]  The Library of Congress, K. Billy Hutchinson, was one of the U.S.
[00:00:51.021 --> 00:00:51.802]  representatives there.
[00:00:52.202 --> 00:00:54.485]  They had that about a month before they met in Europe.
[00:00:55.086 --> 00:00:56.627]  So, we've seen this trick before.
[00:00:56.687 --> 00:00:58.268]  We'll be fleshing that out.
[00:00:58.288 --> 00:01:01.810]  We're going to take your calls early in this hour at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:08.194]  And whatever the subject is, Galen Ross, Robert Galen Ross, can comment on it.
[00:01:08.654 --> 00:01:11.296]  He worked with the NSA in intelligence.
[00:01:12.056 --> 00:01:22.843]  He then was international consultant to oil companies, lived all over the Middle East, all over the world, and he's been fighting the New World Order for decades, written quite a few very well-received, very well-selling books.
[00:01:23.143 --> 00:01:27.186]  We carry quite a few of them at the online bookstore at InfoWars.com.
[00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:29.288]  Before we go to them, I'd like to just say this.
[00:01:29.948 --> 00:01:35.033]  I was watching early this morning a clip of Endgame on YouTube.
[00:01:35.053 --> 00:01:36.113]  Just a little five-minute clip.
[00:01:36.974 --> 00:01:40.157]  And I kind of sat back and said, man, I made this documentary.
[00:01:40.197 --> 00:01:41.057]  This is really good.
[00:01:41.798 --> 00:01:43.459]  And I thought, man, this needs to be seen.
[00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:45.381]  It was like I was discovering someone else's work.
[00:01:46.322 --> 00:01:47.623]  And I was just realizing that
[00:01:48.613 --> 00:01:49.934]  I tend to not toot my horn.
[00:01:51.516 --> 00:01:52.597]  But this is quite a weapon.
[00:01:53.358 --> 00:01:58.744]  And it really shows who the globalists are, what their master plan is, what they're doing, how to stop them.
[00:02:00.512 --> 00:02:02.493]  The film is 2 hours 20 minutes long.
[00:02:02.573 --> 00:02:04.333]  It's got 40 minutes of extras on the DVD.
[00:02:04.433 --> 00:02:05.893]  It's got about 3 hours total.
[00:02:05.973 --> 00:02:06.073]  It's $19.95.
[00:02:06.634 --> 00:02:09.854]  You can get it for $9.95 when you get it with Terror Storm or some of the other films.
[00:02:11.255 --> 00:02:12.755]  This is how we support ourselves.
[00:02:13.075 --> 00:02:16.696]  This is how I hire more people, get better websites, better servers.
[00:02:17.276 --> 00:02:20.377]  This is how we buy better cameras, fly places, and cover things.
[00:02:21.217 --> 00:02:25.518]  And I advertise on my own show that Endgame is free on Google Video.
[00:02:26.198 --> 00:02:29.783]  And I want you to go watch it there, and I want you to email it out to everybody.
[00:02:30.464 --> 00:02:39.538]  And in fact, I uploaded it in-game myself to Google Video the day it was released at PrisonPlanet.tv, the day it was released on DVD.
[00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:40.980]  And why did I do that?
[00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:43.942]  Because this isn't about making money.
[00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:48.145]  Money is fuel that I put in my engine to fight the New World Order.
[00:02:48.185 --> 00:02:53.568]  We are a juggernaut of truth and liberty against them, and I literally see it as fuel.
[00:02:54.169 --> 00:03:03.294]  To me, who I am, telling the truth, being honorable, being truthful, fighting tyranny, defending my family name, trying to build a better world for those...
[00:03:04.275 --> 00:03:05.376]  They're going to come in the future.
[00:03:06.016 --> 00:03:07.898]  That is what makes me tick.
[00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:17.466]  And I get so focused on that so often that we then don't call for capital and call for the capital we need to do bigger things.
[00:03:17.726 --> 00:03:21.809]  And I wasn't going to mention this right now because it got organized last week.
[00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:23.210]  The nice fellow keeps calling.
[00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.832]  He's the original guy that came up with the money bomb.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.523]  For Ron Paul, then it got picked up by others and carried, one of my listeners.
[00:03:33.024 --> 00:03:35.165]  And he's got this Alex Jones money bomb.
[00:03:35.726 --> 00:03:39.308]  And I kind of thought about it over the weekend, and people around the office have asked me, what are you going to do?
[00:03:39.848 --> 00:03:41.289]  You know, you need to put a PayPal link up.
[00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:42.230]  This guy wants you to.
[00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.431]  And I thought, should I do that?
[00:03:44.331 --> 00:03:46.313]  You know, I mean, I always raise money for other people.
[00:03:46.753 --> 00:03:48.934]  And I will say that, yes, we're going to get a PayPal up.
[00:03:48.954 --> 00:03:49.835]  In fact, that needs to happen.
[00:03:49.855 --> 00:03:50.856]  We need to make sure that's happening.
[00:03:52.257 --> 00:04:01.312]  Uh, and we need to, if you give us donations, we will buy better computers, better software, better effects for our films.
[00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:05.445]  I mean, I'm already going to get a bigger office.
[00:04:05.465 --> 00:04:06.406]  We're out looking right now.
[00:04:06.706 --> 00:04:11.269]  But I will factor that in to hiring more people, doing more.
[00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:18.134]  I need to get a second IT person full-time because it's just overwhelming the amount of work that we've got to do here.
[00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:21.777]  We've got to grow fast because the New World Order is making their move right now.
[00:04:22.358 --> 00:04:25.100]  So that said, there isn't even a PayPal up for this yet.
[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.944]  The next day or two we'll link to the Money Bomb, the Alex Jones Money Bomb.
[00:04:28.984 --> 00:04:29.985]  I forget the address.
[00:04:30.425 --> 00:04:36.411]  But the Money Bomb right now is just go to Infowars.com and buy Robert Galen Ross' books that we sell, that we support him to.
[00:04:36.852 --> 00:04:38.694]  Buy In Game Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:04:38.954 --> 00:04:40.896]  Have it on DVD, the high quality DVD.
[00:04:40.936 --> 00:04:41.537]  Give it to people.
[00:04:42.157 --> 00:04:42.458]  That's great!
[00:04:59.219 --> 00:04:59.940]  We're good to go.
[00:05:14.278 --> 00:05:23.720]  Posted within an hour of the end of the show for you to watch how you want, when you want, where you want with the document cam and the guest cam and everything else that we bring you here.
[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.021]  So, I have not been really calling for your support lately.
[00:05:27.421 --> 00:05:42.084]  I've been trying to just run off sponsorship and the little bit of videos we sell, but I start looking at the accounting as we're doing it and realize that if we had a lot more capital come in, I will dump it directly into the tip of the spear, directly into going after the globalists because
[00:05:43.004 --> 00:05:44.566]  I'm committed to this.
[00:05:44.706 --> 00:05:45.908]  I mean, I've cast the dice.
[00:05:45.948 --> 00:05:46.869]  The dice are rolled.
[00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:48.591]  And I'm in this fight 110%.
[00:05:48.631 --> 00:05:52.636]  And I've just been realizing why stand here idle?
[00:05:52.696 --> 00:05:53.837]  Why not even work harder?
[00:05:54.218 --> 00:05:57.642]  You know, why not make three films this year like we're doing right now instead of one a year?
[00:05:58.042 --> 00:05:59.444]  Why not up the game?
[00:06:00.605 --> 00:06:01.486]  Update the websites.
[00:06:01.546 --> 00:06:04.707]  Why not make them a higher quality web 2.5 or whatever?
[00:06:05.067 --> 00:06:06.448]  Why not get more aggressive?
[00:06:07.008 --> 00:06:09.409]  I mean, if we're going to fight the New World Order, let's do it all the way.
[00:06:09.429 --> 00:06:12.951]  So I want to thank all of you that have supported us at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:13.471 --> 00:06:18.814]  I want to thank all of you that have gotten the books and videos at Infowars.com or called 888-253-3139.
[00:06:18.834 --> 00:06:27.838]  All of you that have purchased the books and videos, that is really a donation to us so we can continue what we're doing and so I can also try to pay my people well.
[00:06:28.658 --> 00:06:29.179]  I like to pay them.
[00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:32.763]  They're not paid exorbitantly, but they're paid decent for people in media.
[00:06:33.043 --> 00:06:41.472]  Folks in media don't make a lot of money at the grassroots level, and I'd like to try to reward them, help them, make sure they can put food on their family's table.
[00:06:41.913 --> 00:06:49.261]  As the economy implodes, that's another reason I'm kind of like a squirrel for winter, trying to get some nuts away, because we don't run this like a profit business.
[00:06:49.821 --> 00:07:05.226]  If everything starts going to hell in a hand basket, as it's starting to, and our capital goes down, and less money comes in, I'm just going to spend the savings I've accrued, which are modest, but that are there to fund this, to go all the way until we ran out of money, until we aren't here.
[00:07:05.927 --> 00:07:06.608]  That's the goal.
[00:07:06.668 --> 00:07:07.609]  Go all the way.
[00:07:07.869 --> 00:07:10.773]  Like a missile that expends its fuel as it comes in for impact.
[00:07:12.315 --> 00:07:13.237]  We're not retreating.
[00:07:13.517 --> 00:07:14.438]  We're not going back.
[00:07:14.478 --> 00:07:15.440]  And we're doing well.
[00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:15.981]  We're expanding.
[00:07:16.001 --> 00:07:16.421]  We're growing.
[00:07:16.782 --> 00:07:20.807]  My point is, if we go into a depression, I am going to continue on as long as we can.
[00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:22.449]  And you need to realize that.
[00:07:22.549 --> 00:07:22.810]  Okay.
[00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.591]  There is my rant on that subject.
[00:07:24.631 --> 00:07:27.515]  I appreciate Robert Galen Ross joining us in studio.
[00:07:28.015 --> 00:07:31.439]  And Robert, I'd like you to get into the economy.
[00:07:31.459 --> 00:07:35.723]  You know, you've consulted internationally in finance, in oil, in commerce.
[00:07:35.804 --> 00:07:37.726]  You've worked in the government and intelligence.
[00:07:38.266 --> 00:07:42.909]  You've really, in the books you've written, forecasted a lot of what has actually developed in your film.
[00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:45.210]  You forecasted what would happen with the NAU.
[00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:56.557]  So I really respect your opinion, and we want to bring you here as another one of our family of experts, wise men that know what's going on, to break down what's really happening with the economy.
[00:07:56.797 --> 00:08:03.701]  Then coming up at the bottom of the hour, we'll start taking calls, and I want to shift gears into the globalist structure later, and what their master plans are.
[00:08:03.961 --> 00:08:06.182]  But Robert, again, thank you for coming into the studio.
[00:08:06.482 --> 00:08:07.323]  I really do appreciate it.
[00:08:07.503 --> 00:08:09.184]  It's always a pleasure to be with you, Alex.
[00:08:09.584 --> 00:08:10.245]  Thanks for being here.
[00:08:10.625 --> 00:08:11.485]  You've got the floor.
[00:08:11.726 --> 00:08:13.066]  Please tell us what's happening with banking.
[00:08:13.667 --> 00:08:18.890]  Okay, the world financial system is in meltdown.
[00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:22.392]  They won't admit that publicly.
[00:08:23.331 --> 00:08:26.475]  But the signs, the vital signs are showing up all the time.
[00:08:26.495 --> 00:08:43.175]  And we can go back as far as February 27, 1995, when a fellow named Nick Leeson was one of the key people with bearings in Southeast Asia.
[00:08:44.576 --> 00:08:50.597]  Barings, at the time they went under, was Britain's oldest bank.
[00:08:51.737 --> 00:08:58.379]  And Leeson got to dealing in derivatives, and he crashed the company in a very short period of time.
[00:08:59.379 --> 00:09:05.120]  And Barings was a very large company at that time, and so this is how vulnerable they are.
[00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:08.661]  And I'm sure that all banks have put in
[00:09:10.861 --> 00:09:17.662]  Safety valves, and watch your people very closely to keep from being crashed like that again.
[00:09:18.483 --> 00:09:24.344]  But just recently, as late as March 14, 2008, Bear Stearns went under.
[00:09:24.484 --> 00:09:27.825]  Bear Stearns in November of 2007 was rated by
[00:09:41.493 --> 00:09:42.033]  Goldman Sachs at $118 a share.
[00:09:42.053 --> 00:09:45.195]  And so when they finally died in February, they were bought out by JPMorgan Chase at $2 a share.
[00:10:04.088 --> 00:10:07.851]  And so this is how quick this could happen.
[00:10:08.792 --> 00:10:12.574]  Now, there are others looming on the horizon.
[00:10:13.795 --> 00:10:24.443]  On May 9, 2008, the CEO of Citigroup announced that they were fixing to write off $400 billion of their assets.
[00:10:25.404 --> 00:10:29.827]  Now, to them, an asset is something like a mortgage or something like that.
[00:10:31.128 --> 00:10:37.195]  Most of these mortgages are worthless, and so that's the reason they're writing them off.
[00:10:39.878 --> 00:10:44.423]  In the first quarter of 2008, Citigroup lost $5.1 billion.
[00:10:52.105 --> 00:10:55.710]  First quarter of 2007, they lost $10 billion.
[00:10:56.391 --> 00:11:00.196]  So Citigroup is really fixing to go under.
[00:11:02.058 --> 00:11:08.507]  But the Fed Chairman Bernanke has already informed the public that
[00:11:09.728 --> 00:11:11.088]  No bank will go under.
[00:11:11.228 --> 00:11:27.993]  And he's saying, yeah, he said that today, he said everything's wonderful, meanwhile the dollar's being devalued at about 30% a year now, there are millions of houses going into repossession, people are walking away from millions others, there's a huge contraction even in retail, and the media's busy running around saying everything's wonderful.
[00:11:29.094 --> 00:11:36.196]  That's right, and they're saying that as a smoke screen trying to hide what's really going on behind a curtain.
[00:11:37.402 --> 00:11:51.694]  And if you do a Google search for the MZM money supply, there's a chart on there that shows that the money supply is almost vertical right now.
[00:11:52.014 --> 00:11:54.116]  They're printing money like it's going out of style.
[00:11:54.797 --> 00:12:00.541]  Stay there Robert Gale and Ross will continue with what the global economic architects are up to.
[00:12:01.502 --> 00:12:02.883]  It is a big idea.
[00:12:02.903 --> 00:12:04.985]  A new world order.
[00:12:05.712 --> 00:12:09.955]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:12:10.616 --> 00:12:12.777]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:12:13.218 --> 00:12:15.679]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:18.682]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:12:19.422 --> 00:12:26.748]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:12:29.746 --> 00:12:34.727]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:12:35.207 --> 00:12:38.668]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:12:39.068 --> 00:12:41.568]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:12:41.628 --> 00:12:42.788]  Most people have no idea.
[00:12:42.808 --> 00:12:43.568]  They're not after money.
[00:12:43.588 --> 00:12:44.669]  They have all the money they need.
[00:12:44.849 --> 00:12:45.569]  They're after power.
[00:12:45.609 --> 00:12:46.669]  That's what they're after these days.
[00:12:46.989 --> 00:12:51.510]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.962]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:14:03.262 --> 00:14:04.543]  Loose change, final cut.
[00:14:04.823 --> 00:14:06.805]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:14:06.965 --> 00:14:08.626]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:14:08.626 --> 00:14:09.106]  We're good.
[00:14:38.686 --> 00:14:39.146]  We're good.
[00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:03.561]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[00:15:03.821 --> 00:15:08.262]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[00:15:08.522 --> 00:15:13.422]  I have run across a company called SFR, who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[00:15:13.823 --> 00:15:24.825]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, Protecta Complete Fuel System Treatment cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage in only one tank full.
[00:15:25.045 --> 00:15:27.405]  Protecta Engine Treatment not only reduces friction,
[00:15:27.825 --> 00:15:29.546]  But it extends the life of your engine.
[00:15:29.847 --> 00:15:30.507]  Let's face it.
[00:15:30.767 --> 00:15:33.309]  With the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[00:15:33.609 --> 00:15:41.155]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment which is a $12.95 value free.
[00:15:41.615 --> 00:15:43.696]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:15:43.917 --> 00:15:46.779]  That number again is 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:15:47.039 --> 00:15:50.821]  Or check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com.
[00:15:51.102 --> 00:15:52.823]  That's oilcompanysecret.com.
[00:15:53.283 --> 00:15:55.645]  Satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[00:15:56.125 --> 00:15:57.527]  And it's safe for all cars.
[00:15:57.547 --> 00:15:58.167]  Act now.
[00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:08.557]  We don't need no education We don't need no thought control
[00:16:14.918 --> 00:16:16.439]  Robert Galen Ross is our guest.
[00:16:16.459 --> 00:16:17.880]  Your call is coming up in the next segment.
[00:16:18.281 --> 00:16:21.564]  A host of issues we'll be discussing going into the third hour.
[00:16:22.464 --> 00:16:26.147]  Tony Gosling on the Bilderberg Group joining us in the fourth hour today.
[00:16:26.848 --> 00:16:30.471]  Robert, continuing with the banking situation please.
[00:16:30.851 --> 00:16:40.043]  Okay, for many years the Federal Reserve had their practice was to loan money to their member banks overnight.
[00:16:40.704 --> 00:16:43.708]  They would loan money to them today, but tomorrow they had to pay it back.
[00:16:44.689 --> 00:16:47.273]  Now the financial situation has gotten so bad now,
[00:16:48.234 --> 00:16:52.536]  That the Fed now has extended overnight practice to 30 days.
[00:16:53.256 --> 00:16:59.219]  And even they say, if you can't pay us back in 30 days, we'll consider extending that period.
[00:16:59.879 --> 00:17:03.400]  So, it's really getting bad in the financial system.
[00:17:04.801 --> 00:17:07.562]  Now, on September 2007, the Fed interest rate was 5.25%.
[00:17:07.602 --> 00:17:09.163]  On May 2nd, 2008, they reduced this to 2%.
[00:17:17.226 --> 00:17:24.653]  And in an effort to try to stop this runaway financial problem.
[00:17:26.734 --> 00:17:32.219]  Now they also, the Bank of England has followed suit.
[00:17:32.299 --> 00:17:42.067]  They've told their banks that they're putting 50 billion pounds available for banks to aid in their financial situation.
[00:17:42.908 --> 00:18:03.300]  The Japanese Central Bank has been running at 1.5% interest for years and a lot of other people are borrowing money from the Japanese Central Bank and buying assets around the world and it costs them 1.5% and they make what they can off of that.
[00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:05.621]  But this is coming to an end.
[00:18:09.193 --> 00:18:17.479]  One of the major problems that is discussed publicly is what they call a subprime lending problem.
[00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:34.871]  Now, the best way to explain that is that a bank will lure someone in to, like they want to buy a home, they'll offer them a low teaser rate interest, but it's variable.
[00:18:35.912 --> 00:18:49.643]  And so they calculate their monetary payments, and the couple figure they can afford that, but within a few short years, all of a sudden they start kicking into these higher rates.
[00:18:50.664 --> 00:19:01.473]  And in many cases, the bank or lending institution don't even check on the credit availability of this couple.
[00:19:02.914 --> 00:19:09.395]  And the reason they do that, just as soon as they loan the money, they don't keep that loan.
[00:19:09.455 --> 00:19:12.356]  They immediately turn around and sell that loan to someone else.
[00:19:12.776 --> 00:19:17.377]  And they also now count loans, as you just said, as an asset.
[00:19:17.457 --> 00:19:23.998]  So a debt is an asset, a liability is an asset, and they leverage that out with fractional reserve banking at least tenfold.
[00:19:24.598 --> 00:19:26.358]  And then they leverage that again tenfold.
[00:19:26.398 --> 00:19:27.978]  Just a Ponzi scheme to the sun.
[00:19:28.219 --> 00:19:28.639]  That's right.
[00:19:32.168 --> 00:19:37.092]  Probably the best way to illustrate this is to take a can of mixed nuts.
[00:19:38.233 --> 00:19:51.783]  Let's say that I eat a lot of mixed nuts and they generally come in a clear plastic jar and you can see what's in it, but let's say that macadamia nuts sell for $13 a pound, pistachios for $11 a pound, cashews for $10 a pound, and peanuts
[00:19:57.367 --> 00:19:58.608]  Eight dollars a pound.
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:27.945]  And but if you really, when you get around to opening that can, you'll find just very few macadamias, just a few more pistachios, maybe a handful of cashews.
[00:20:28.366 --> 00:20:30.447]  So it's another carnival barker scam.
[00:20:30.487 --> 00:20:30.927]  That's right.
[00:20:30.967 --> 00:20:36.710]  But in addition to having peanuts, they're even putting in stale and rancid peanuts in here.
[00:20:38.371 --> 00:20:42.196]  Including peanuts that have rat feces in it.
[00:20:42.316 --> 00:20:43.357]  So there's some rat droppings.
[00:20:43.397 --> 00:20:43.958]  That's right.
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:53.549]  And they package these with macadamia nuts on the wrapper, and they sell these to other lending anastacias.
[00:20:54.429 --> 00:20:57.350]  Who then leverage it out again and do the same thing.
[00:20:57.591 --> 00:21:01.032]  So pretty much it's like one peanut per package of rat turds.
[00:21:01.132 --> 00:21:01.612]  That's right.
[00:21:02.573 --> 00:21:09.656]  But now it's gotten so bad that for many years there was interbank lending practice.
[00:21:09.736 --> 00:21:13.258]  If one bank needed some cash they'd just go to the bank next door and borrow money from them.
[00:21:14.358 --> 00:21:24.569]  They won't loan money to one another because the assets they're putting up for collateral are these toxic waste peanuts.
[00:21:24.729 --> 00:21:27.653]  So the Great Ponzi scheme, it appears, is coming to an end.
[00:21:27.693 --> 00:21:29.475]  Let's talk about, from your experience,
[00:21:29.975 --> 00:21:32.116]  Living quite a long time, living in third world countries.
[00:21:32.896 --> 00:21:34.076]  Where do you think this is going to go?
[00:21:34.516 --> 00:21:36.257]  Is that why they're gearing up for martial law?
[00:21:36.317 --> 00:21:40.818]  Is that why they've been quietly militarizing for decades, knowing that they were going to implode the economy?
[00:21:41.298 --> 00:21:42.698]  And is it by design?
[00:21:42.738 --> 00:21:44.399]  We know it certainly is in some sectors.
[00:21:45.019 --> 00:21:48.019]  We'll come back with Robert Bick, Galen Ross and your phone calls.
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:49.000]  Please stay with us.
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.280]  We're on the march.
[00:21:52.781 --> 00:21:54.381]  The empire's on the run.
[00:21:55.321 --> 00:21:57.982]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:01.058 --> 00:22:06.223]  The Federal Trade Commission estimates that 9 million Americans are victims of identity theft each year.
[00:22:06.423 --> 00:22:11.187]  The crime of identity theft occurs every 3.5 seconds, costing the victims an average of $8,000.
[00:22:12.448 --> 00:22:19.274]  If you own a PC, passwords are a common form of authentication, and often the only protection between a hacker and your personal information.
[00:22:19.594 --> 00:22:28.216]  Passwords that are stored in a spreadsheet, text file, data file, or any other file that is not encrypted and password protected are vulnerable to malicious theft and misuse.

[00:23:01.871 --> 00:23:05.213]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[00:23:05.634 --> 00:23:07.855]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us,
[00:23:10.636 --> 00:23:15.882]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[00:23:16.102 --> 00:23:26.653]  Though the people of the U.S., where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reining them in and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[00:23:27.113 --> 00:23:28.335]  They are called Illuminati.
[00:23:28.715 --> 00:23:29.656]  We're good to go.
[00:23:58.715 --> 00:23:59.055]  We're good.
[00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:20.912]  The package contains six DVDs that contain ten different programs.
[00:24:21.252 --> 00:24:24.854]  Two books that combined are over a thousand pages and other information.

[00:24:28.516 --> 00:24:32.458]  That's mostholyfamilymonastery.com.
[00:24:32.758 --> 00:24:36.640]  The last word monastery is spelled M-O-N-A-S-T-E-R-Y.
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:37.441]  Or call us at 1-800-275-1126.
[00:24:37.461 --> 00:24:37.661]  That's 1-800-275-1126.
[00:24:42.222 --> 00:24:43.083]  We're good to go.
[00:25:21.318 --> 00:25:30.144]  People wonder how the New World Order can have such incredible power.
[00:25:52.371 --> 00:25:54.733]  They wonder how they can buy armies, countries.
[00:25:56.135 --> 00:26:03.602]  How they can come into every town and city, even small towns, and spend a million, two million, to fluoridate your water, because they care about you so much.
[00:26:04.303 --> 00:26:05.704]  How they can buy off anybody.
[00:26:07.026 --> 00:26:08.087]  Anybody that will take their money.
[00:26:09.301 --> 00:26:10.282]  Because it's all fiat.
[00:26:10.302 --> 00:26:11.382]  They just make it out of nothing.
[00:26:12.003 --> 00:26:13.044]  They back it up with force.
[00:26:13.164 --> 00:26:14.685]  They buy with their own fiat.
[00:26:15.465 --> 00:26:17.827]  And then they train the society that debt is good.
[00:26:17.907 --> 00:26:18.527]  Get into debt.
[00:26:18.547 --> 00:26:19.908]  The public schools, the colleges.
[00:26:20.649 --> 00:26:26.733]  It's come out that they have credit card agreements with the companies, public schools and colleges, to tell the kids to take credit cards to get in debt.
[00:26:27.293 --> 00:26:28.854]  All designed to get you shackled.
[00:26:28.954 --> 00:26:30.615]  All designed to get control.
[00:26:30.675 --> 00:26:37.000]  And now, after bubble, after bubble, after bubble, we're in the final bubbles that economists always said we would see before a total implosion.
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.161]  And that is just a speculative bubble.
[00:26:39.862 --> 00:26:39.942]  Yes.
[00:26:57.083 --> 00:27:11.307]  by the private banks that own and control it, is to beef up, to militarize, to build camps, to say the public is the enemy, that the government are the officials, the authorities, clearly in response to the population.
[00:27:11.667 --> 00:27:26.432]  Robert Galen Ross, before we get more into whether you think we're going to have a depression or not, and how we're getting to this apex of the mega-bubble, the super-bubble, A, do you think that's why one of the reasons they're gearing up their police state, and B, do you believe this was engineered by design?
[00:27:27.951 --> 00:27:34.975]  Alex, nothing of significance happens in the entire world that is not very carefully planned years in advance.
[00:27:36.516 --> 00:27:44.521]  These people hire the best and the brightest to do all this for them, and they're just clay.
[00:27:44.782 --> 00:27:53.407]  They mold them any way they want to, and so they make things happen, and they don't care what happens.
[00:27:56.362 --> 00:27:59.724]  They're really concerned about what's going to happen ten years from now.
[00:28:00.645 --> 00:28:02.366]  And it's all very carefully planned.
[00:28:02.866 --> 00:28:07.469]  Well, I harp on this a lot, but it's because it's a seminal source document.
[00:28:07.489 --> 00:28:11.232]  2002, Joseph Stiglitz, Chief Economist, World Bank.
[00:28:11.252 --> 00:28:13.413]  He's a globalist, but he said he didn't believe in hurting people.
[00:28:13.873 --> 00:28:14.614]  They give him a 119 point plan.
[00:28:17.284 --> 00:28:17.384]  Yes.
[00:28:32.355 --> 00:28:32.715]  We're good to go.
[00:28:54.762 --> 00:29:07.174]  So, and he said what they did to the third world countries, they're now planning to do to the West, and I just had him on a few weeks ago, again, he's been on the radio with us twice and in an in-person video interview once, and he admitted, yes, they're engineering this.
[00:29:07.674 --> 00:29:12.239]  I mean, we have the IMF documents where they're saying they're doing it.
[00:29:12.539 --> 00:29:13.380]  There's no debating it.
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:24.703]  Yeah, but you know there's a strange guy behind the bushes that's taking care of this fellow named Hugo Chavez, president of Venezuela.
[00:29:25.943 --> 00:29:32.685]  The elite denigrate him, they say he's communist, he's a dictator, he's doing terrible things.
[00:29:33.265 --> 00:29:38.867]  To me he's a hero because he has single-handedly stopped the creation of the American Union.
[00:29:39.667 --> 00:29:42.608]  And a number of the things that he's done is
[00:29:43.877 --> 00:29:54.109]  He's created what they call the Bank of the South, which is a central bank owned by Venezuela, or funded by Venezuela, Brazil and Argentina.
[00:29:54.169 --> 00:29:55.291]  And they've now dumped the dollar.
[00:29:55.351 --> 00:29:58.535]  You can't buy their oil, and that's what 33%, 34% of all of our oil.
[00:29:58.555 --> 00:29:59.496]  Can't buy it with dollars now.
[00:29:59.516 --> 00:29:59.936]  That's right.
[00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:19.425]  But they created this bank and they're loaning money to all the Latin American countries to pay off the IMF and World Bank loans early so they can get out from under this burden and they loan this money to them at very low interest rates and so that's one by
[00:30:19.465 --> 00:30:23.588]  By the way, you work for oil companies, you know they're paying 18 cents a gallon in Venezuela.
[00:30:24.028 --> 00:30:26.109]  They're paying like 25 cents a gallon in Mexico.
[00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:29.311]  They're paying 14 cents a gallon for diesel in Mexico.
[00:30:30.312 --> 00:30:35.936]  Just like we pay five, six times what somebody in Mexico pays for prescription drugs, we pay double what somebody in Europe.
[00:30:36.316 --> 00:30:39.538]  Why is it that Americans are seen as the schmuck cattle?
[00:30:39.898 --> 00:30:44.461]  We're just, we get treated the worst, our cops treat us the worst, everything, but we think we're free.
[00:30:47.003 --> 00:30:48.705]  They've dumbed the people down.
[00:30:49.265 --> 00:30:53.108]  They've done it very carefully planned.
[00:30:53.728 --> 00:31:00.814]  They've done them down in schools, and they provide them with information on the mass media that they want to hear.
[00:31:01.655 --> 00:31:06.398]  All of it is designed psycho-control.
[00:31:07.379 --> 00:31:12.002]  And so that they really don't protest what's going on.
[00:31:12.382 --> 00:31:19.266]  As long as they can have their six-pack and watch their football game or play a game of pool, that's all I care.
[00:31:19.486 --> 00:31:22.028]  Now, speak of the devil, that may be what's coming next.
[00:31:22.788 --> 00:31:28.511]  I know you were around during the last Great Depression that they admit in mainline textbooks was engineered by the bankers.
[00:31:28.892 --> 00:31:31.133]  Maybe we should start there with what they did then.
[00:31:32.374 --> 00:31:36.016]  In 1929, deepening for three years, into the depths of it in late 1933.
[00:31:36.377 --> 00:31:43.062]  Compare that to, I mean the bubble we've got now, the indebtedness we have now of every sector, private, corporate, government.
[00:31:44.042 --> 00:31:47.345]  The amount of leveraging, it's two different universes.
[00:31:48.225 --> 00:31:53.229]  I mean, 90% or 85% being rural then, now only 5% being self-sufficient today.
[00:31:53.249 --> 00:31:55.251]  I mean, we're talking about a recipe for
[00:31:55.971 --> 00:31:57.173]  Absolute breakdown.
[00:31:57.213 --> 00:32:03.022]  I'm not saying it's going to happen, but there's a good chance it is, and if it does, I mean, this is going to be unbelievable.
[00:32:03.462 --> 00:32:13.489]  You know, the real truth is that from 1920 to 1929, the Federal Reserve started a very loose money policy.
[00:32:13.529 --> 00:32:16.431]  They would loan people money on anything.
[00:32:17.111 --> 00:32:24.996]  And so people started investing in stocks and bonds, commodities, because they were going to get rich over it.
[00:32:25.697 --> 00:32:32.862]  And so in 29, all of a sudden, they pulled in the money and they started calling loans.
[00:32:33.762 --> 00:32:37.184]  And people couldn't pay these loans, and a lot of people committed suicide over it.
[00:32:37.784 --> 00:32:40.806]  But this was very carefully designed.
[00:32:41.026 --> 00:32:47.570]  One of the main reasons they did this is that at that point in 1913 is when they created the Federal Reserve.
[00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:51.772]  And so most of the money were in state banks.
[00:32:52.152 --> 00:32:55.774]  And a lot of the state banks wouldn't join the Federal Reserve System.
[00:32:55.834 --> 00:32:58.176]  So they said, well, all right, we'll go get them anyway.
[00:32:58.216 --> 00:33:02.698]  So they said, we've got to crash these state banks and get their money.
[00:33:03.399 --> 00:33:06.500]  And so that was one of the main reasons for the 29 Depression.
[00:33:08.251 --> 00:33:08.791]  Absolutely.
[00:33:08.871 --> 00:33:12.313]  And of course they had already engineered runs on banks before that's come out.
[00:33:12.733 --> 00:33:14.774]  National Banking Association documents have come out.
[00:33:15.094 --> 00:33:16.215]  And they said, give us the Federal Reserve.
[00:33:16.235 --> 00:33:18.676]  There will never be another recession.
[00:33:18.696 --> 00:33:20.076]  There will never be another run.
[00:33:20.536 --> 00:33:21.197]  We promise.
[00:33:21.237 --> 00:33:26.979]  And then they engineered the 29 crash and then cut off all credit as they're getting ready to do now.
[00:33:27.239 --> 00:33:27.840]  That's right.
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:37.324]  And the stated purpose of the creation of the Federal Reserve was to normalize and steady the financial situation so they wouldn't have all these ups and downs.
[00:33:38.044 --> 00:33:43.868]  But every up and down that's happened in the financial world is created by the central banks.
[00:33:43.908 --> 00:33:45.088]  Well, look at what they're doing now.
[00:33:45.889 --> 00:33:52.473]  Just as the Federal Reserve got more power after they engineered the Great Depression, now they're saying, get rid of the three federal agencies that regulate us.
[00:33:52.813 --> 00:33:57.076]  And I'm not saying they're good, but they're corrupt and controlled, but at least it's some semblance of regulation.
[00:33:57.396 --> 00:34:02.179]  They said, let us run everything secretly, get rid of these three federal agencies, let us run everything.
[00:34:02.799 --> 00:34:03.960]  And then everything will be okay.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.122]  So they're saying, just, you know, we're the ones that have engineered this, admittedly, changing the rules for all this loaning.
[00:34:10.542 --> 00:34:11.703]  Fiat to infinitum.
[00:34:12.443 --> 00:34:14.104]  Just no limit to infinity.
[00:34:14.864 --> 00:34:17.585]  And now, so that's their formula.
[00:34:17.685 --> 00:34:23.588]  Always create a crisis, and then as the crisis deepens, offer the next solution which expands their power.
[00:34:23.908 --> 00:34:25.809]  Then they deepen the next crisis even bigger.
[00:34:26.069 --> 00:34:26.349]  Then they
[00:34:26.889 --> 00:34:29.852]  Get more power, then they expand an even greater crisis and get more power.
[00:34:30.513 --> 00:34:32.135]  But now they're coming into total ownership.
[00:34:32.175 --> 00:34:38.962]  I mean, I've seen the numbers of thousands of trillions of liquid fiat they made that was accepted globally.
[00:34:39.243 --> 00:34:44.669]  They literally bought up the entire global infrastructure, except for a handful of private interest in Europe and the US.
[00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:52.054]  Now they're changing laws to take that for middle class people, and they write white papers saying they don't even need the peasants anymore.
[00:34:52.535 --> 00:35:03.283]  I mean, they have created this tsunami of liquidity, bought the world with it, and now they're going to turn that liquidity off and get what crumbs they didn't have.
[00:35:04.063 --> 00:35:08.105]  And all of the funds that they have are created out of thin air.
[00:35:08.146 --> 00:35:10.007]  They're not backed by anything.
[00:35:10.867 --> 00:35:18.211]  But I suggest you go to, do a Google search on MZM money supply or money stock.
[00:35:18.932 --> 00:35:22.353]  MZM stands for money zero maturity.
[00:35:23.214 --> 00:35:27.957]  And that's made up of the M2 money supply and several other financial indicators.
[00:35:28.857 --> 00:35:35.820]  And I've got their data from the Federal Reserve and created a graph on that.
[00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:41.803]  And the last two or three years, that graph has gone vertical.
[00:35:43.298 --> 00:35:46.301]  Well, in fact, they have a lot of private groups that analyze it, and that's what they say.
[00:35:47.302 --> 00:35:51.405]  Bernanke stopped releasing the numbers 12 months ago.
[00:35:51.465 --> 00:35:52.806]  Did you reverse-engineer that?
[00:35:52.846 --> 00:35:54.267]  How did you get the numbers, the latest ones?
[00:35:54.387 --> 00:35:55.308]  No, I got it from St.
[00:35:55.348 --> 00:35:55.928]  Louis Fed.
[00:35:57.009 --> 00:36:00.972]  Oh, you're talking about the internal money supply numbers?
[00:36:01.052 --> 00:36:02.414]  That's right.
[00:36:02.734 --> 00:36:06.937]  But the Federal Reserve quit reporting the M3 money supply.
[00:36:09.959 --> 00:36:18.724]  Some of the private institutions are still generating the M3, but it's not done by the Fed.
[00:36:19.545 --> 00:36:20.365]  Well, I want to explain.
[00:36:20.385 --> 00:36:22.566]  I know most of you know this, but your neighbors don't know this.
[00:36:22.626 --> 00:36:28.590]  I talk to people who've got degrees, and they just don't understand that it's like the peso or the ruble.
[00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:35.674]  Our elite have made the decision to devalue it, and that leaves you holding the bag while they hold all the real assets.
[00:36:36.494 --> 00:36:51.620]  And then you can see the parallel, how suddenly there's cops on every corner, suddenly there's helicopters flying overheads, cameras going in, and then you read the government documents, they say, yeah, we're going to implode everything you've got, and if you riot, or if you fight back against us, we're going to gun you down the streets.
[00:36:52.281 --> 00:37:02.165]  Well now, a lot of people are really playing down the oil companies, giving them hell about increasing their price of oil.
[00:37:02.972 --> 00:37:05.373]  They're only making the same 8% profit they always did.
[00:37:05.573 --> 00:37:07.094]  They did not raise their prices.
[00:37:07.274 --> 00:37:08.274]  The dollar went down.
[00:37:08.434 --> 00:37:15.337]  The oil is dollar-denominated, so when the value of the dollar goes down, the value of the oil goes up.
[00:37:15.817 --> 00:37:23.040]  And so gold and oil and silver and a number of the commodities are dollar-denominated.
[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:25.921]  So they only go up because the dollar is going down.
[00:37:26.141 --> 00:37:38.509]  And that's what the media so craftily and deceptively all day attacks the oil companies when they're only middleman refining brokers between OPEC cartel, which as you know is predominantly Rothschild-owned.
[00:37:38.789 --> 00:37:46.134]  The Arabs are just dumb and conspicuously consume with their private 747s and brothels in front of everybody.
[00:37:46.995 --> 00:37:49.557]  But you worked as a consultant for oil companies.
[00:37:49.577 --> 00:37:50.677]  Can you break that down for people?
[00:37:51.238 --> 00:37:53.579]  Yeah.
[00:37:53.739 --> 00:37:55.421]  As a matter of fact, this fellow named
[00:37:56.721 --> 00:38:18.947]  John J. McCloy, he was at the secret meeting at Clint Markson's the night before Kennedy was killed, but he was named by the oil companies to be the first negotiator of the OPEC meetings, and so he got with the OPEC nations and
[00:38:19.927 --> 00:38:48.024]  They agreed on a price and a production rate, but McCoy told them, he said, now, we'll allow you, say, $10 a barrel, but every dollar over $10 a barrel, you must deposit in United States banks, particularly JP Morgan and those large banks, because according to Islamic law, it's illegal to create usury or interest rates.
[00:38:49.705 --> 00:38:56.949]  Rather than make money off of interest, these Arab nations, they put their money in the banks in New York City.
[00:38:56.969 --> 00:38:58.009]  That's the insane thing.
[00:38:58.069 --> 00:39:09.255]  They said, what, a thousand years ago, during the Dark Ages, the Catholic Church said, Christians can't own banks, but Jews can, and that's what gave that original power to that group.
[00:39:09.375 --> 00:39:09.795]  That's right.
[00:39:10.396 --> 00:39:11.957]  It's just the same thing over and over again.
[00:39:11.977 --> 00:39:12.337]  That's right.
[00:39:15.018 --> 00:39:16.119]  So it's a legalese.
[00:39:16.239 --> 00:39:18.240]  Oh no, the Arabs don't have usury.
[00:39:18.661 --> 00:39:20.222]  No, the Western banks are doing it for us.
[00:39:20.502 --> 00:39:20.962]  That's right.
[00:39:21.743 --> 00:39:23.724]  But their money are in the U.S.
[00:39:23.764 --> 00:39:24.145]  banks.
[00:39:25.165 --> 00:39:27.347]  And it's the old multiplier.
[00:39:27.407 --> 00:39:30.769]  When a bank has an asset like cash,
[00:39:32.811 --> 00:39:38.255]  They can loan that out and create 9 to 1 for every dollar they have in deposit.
[00:39:38.976 --> 00:39:43.839]  And so that's the main benefit of having this Arab oil in these U.S.
[00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:46.241]  banks is they turn around and multiply it by 9.
[00:39:46.622 --> 00:39:50.365]  Now if there was a dictatorship in Alaska with some guy named King Krom,
[00:39:50.865 --> 00:39:54.126]  They would be getting all the oil out of there right now and wouldn't be using the Arabs.
[00:39:54.467 --> 00:39:57.888]  They use the Arabs because the British shut those countries up 90 years ago, as you know.
[00:39:57.908 --> 00:39:58.608]  You lived over there.
[00:39:59.068 --> 00:40:01.670]  And they made a deal for a monopoly with them.
[00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:06.892]  That's why they run around using the environmentalists as their fronts to keep the real oil from being tapped.
[00:40:07.012 --> 00:40:07.472]  That's right.
[00:40:08.132 --> 00:40:13.274]  They say you can't drill out of California or Florida or places like that for environmental reasons.
[00:40:13.935 --> 00:40:16.056]  The only reason is to keep it off the market.
[00:40:17.357 --> 00:40:23.147]  And I've charted a lot of the characteristics of oil supply.
[00:40:24.489 --> 00:40:41.854]  And oil reserves, and the real facts are that in the very beginning, the oil coming out of an oil well will shoot up because of the pressure in the well, and then it'll start turning down, and will eventually head towards zero.
[00:40:42.314 --> 00:40:44.755]  That is a characteristic of an oil field.
[00:40:45.615 --> 00:40:50.297]  But, and they're using that to say we have peak oil.
[00:40:51.357 --> 00:40:59.107]  But the other side of that coin is they have discovered massive supplies of oil all over the world that they're not putting on the market.
[00:40:59.127 --> 00:41:02.351]  And they're finding the 50- and 60-year-old wells suddenly are full again.
[00:41:03.052 --> 00:41:05.355]  All over Texas they're uncapping them and they're full again.
[00:41:05.375 --> 00:41:08.619]  Yeah, they're gradually, just by seepage, are filling up.
[00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:15.982]  And so, oil companies lie about it.
[00:41:16.642 --> 00:41:19.583]  For the P&L statement, they overstate their reserves.
[00:41:20.764 --> 00:41:33.968]  And back in 2005, the Federal Reserve, I mean the Securities and Exchange Commission, required Shell oil companies to redo their reserves, and they
[00:41:34.748 --> 00:41:40.250]  Did it five times in a 12-month period, and every time they reduced their stated reserves.
[00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:45.451]  Well, we know that's the same with banking, because they're able to get loans, invest, and leverage those proven reserves.
[00:41:45.651 --> 00:41:46.071]  That's right.
[00:41:46.331 --> 00:41:47.512]  Yeah, so it's like money in the bank.
[00:41:47.532 --> 00:41:54.874]  There's so many subjects here, I want to go ahead and go to some phone calls after the break, and then we'll just keep you for the whole next hour if you can do that, Robert.
[00:41:55.154 --> 00:41:59.155]  Okay, we might touch on derivatives, and then we'll get on to other things.
[00:41:59.175 --> 00:42:18.784]  Sure, fantastic, and I want to talk about the mindset, what makes the New World Order tick, why they believe what they believe, and we have Elite Serial Killers of RFK, JFK, MLK, that book available at InfoWars.com, and a couple of the other great books that Robert Ganlon Ross has written, all available at InfoWars.com, or you can also visit his website, give that out, Robert.
[00:42:19.144 --> 00:42:21.185]  It's www.4rie.com, www.4rie.com.
[00:42:27.708 --> 00:42:36.815]  Alright, we're going to break and I promise we're going to go straight to George, Scott, Dave, Mary, and Fred on the other side of this quick break.
[00:42:36.835 --> 00:42:46.462]  We'll take your calls into the bottom of the next hour and for the last 30 minutes we'll shift gears from Robert Gale and Ross into a whole host of other subjects, whatever he thinks most important.
[00:42:46.482 --> 00:42:48.744]  You know, I get these guests in here and I say, hey, what do you want to talk about?
[00:42:48.764 --> 00:42:49.985]  And they say, hey, I want to talk about the economy.
[00:42:50.445 --> 00:42:52.106]  I was like, absolutely, that's important.
[00:42:52.126 --> 00:42:54.147]  So, who knows what he'll want to talk about next?
[00:42:54.207 --> 00:42:56.669]  We will experience that with each other.
[00:42:57.069 --> 00:43:00.891]  Coming up on the other side, InfoWars.com is the website.
[00:43:01.431 --> 00:43:14.159]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:43:14.579 --> 00:43:18.401]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[00:43:18.741 --> 00:43:25.246]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:43:25.626 --> 00:43:28.828]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:43:29.049 --> 00:43:36.534]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:46:55.262 --> 00:47:02.011]  Alright, your call's coming up, but Robert wanted to add something about derivatives on the financial end, and then straight to your calls.
[00:47:02.392 --> 00:47:02.932]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:47:04.094 --> 00:47:09.301]  I mentioned in the beginning that a fellow named Neeson that bankrupted the
[00:47:10.442 --> 00:47:13.964]  Barings back in 1995 dealing in derivatives.
[00:47:14.044 --> 00:47:15.585]  So let's just touch on that a little bit.
[00:47:15.625 --> 00:47:16.866]  What is a derivative?
[00:47:16.986 --> 00:47:29.954]  A derivative is something by definition is the value is based on some underlying asset like a corporate bond or a treasury bond or something like that.
[00:47:30.754 --> 00:47:33.476]  But it turns out to be a wager.
[00:47:33.956 --> 00:47:34.617]  They can wager
[00:47:35.595 --> 00:47:36.115]  On anything.
[00:47:36.156 --> 00:47:38.917]  They can wager on the global warming.
[00:47:38.957 --> 00:47:42.280]  They can wager on the tide levels.
[00:47:43.321 --> 00:47:49.225]  They generally wager on things like the dollar index or something like that.
[00:47:50.065 --> 00:47:56.169]  But let's just look at the involvement of the major banks and derivatives.
[00:47:56.770 --> 00:48:00.032]  JPMorgan Chase has total assets of 1.2 trillion dollars.
[00:48:02.774 --> 00:48:06.757]  They own $91.7 trillion in derivatives.
[00:48:08.078 --> 00:48:15.162]  Citibank has total assets of $1.23 trillion but their derivative exposure is $34 trillion.
[00:48:16.643 --> 00:48:18.665]  Bank of America has assets of $1.3 trillion
[00:48:20.888 --> 00:48:24.030]  And their derivative exposure is $32.1 trillion.
[00:48:24.810 --> 00:48:32.954]  Wachovia Bank has assets of a little over a half a trillion, and their exposure is a little over $5 trillion.
[00:48:34.655 --> 00:48:42.279]  HSBC Bank has assets of about $0.2 trillion, exposure of $4.4 trillion.
[00:48:42.599 --> 00:48:45.900]  So, if things go wrong,
[00:48:48.158 --> 00:48:48.838]  I just said it.
[00:48:49.959 --> 00:48:56.962]  For example, JPMorgan Chase assets $1.2 trillion and they have an exposure of about $92 trillion.
[00:48:57.662 --> 00:48:58.703]  They can't pay that off.
[00:48:59.963 --> 00:49:01.264]  So what are they going to do?
[00:49:01.284 --> 00:49:12.989]  Of course, the Federal Reserve has said that they will not let any bank fail, so the Federal Reserve will step in and save them, but they don't have enough assets to cover their liability.
[00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:15.010]  Now to be clear,
[00:49:17.006 --> 00:49:29.478]  The big central banks and the private brokerage houses, they have already put their real assets into commodities, into infrastructure, into institutions.
[00:49:30.278 --> 00:49:38.346]  Now they're just going to have the public back up those institutions, their front institutions, and then basically drive the dollar
[00:49:39.086 --> 00:49:46.297]  Uh, some value into the ground and then leave us holding the bag claiming this is some communal debt when it was created out of fraud.
[00:49:46.317 --> 00:49:47.519]  So they get us coming and going.
[00:49:47.539 --> 00:49:52.005]  It's kind of like they ship the drugs in and then put us in jail if they catch us using them.
[00:49:52.266 --> 00:49:53.447]  They always have that formula.
[00:49:54.275 --> 00:50:07.605]  Yeah, there's a fellow named Jim Rogers that is a big financial guru, and I saw a video of him on YouTube recently, and he says he's completely out of the dollar.
[00:50:08.385 --> 00:50:10.127]  In fact, I think he lives in Hong Kong.
[00:50:10.447 --> 00:50:15.771]  But his position is that we need to get rid of the Federal Reserve System and fire Bernanke.
[00:50:16.852 --> 00:50:18.073]  Yeah, he said that from Singapore.
[00:50:19.246 --> 00:50:24.730]  On Bloomberg, but I think everybody lives in Hong Kong, but I remember that newscast we played some of that audio here.
[00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:28.272]  We're going to come back and go directly to George, Scott, Dave, Mary, Fred.
[00:50:29.032 --> 00:50:36.016]  We've got the third hour straight ahead, then we've got a lot of news coming up and a special guest joining us from England about the Bilderberg Group.
[00:50:36.036 --> 00:50:39.759]  Did they already meet, or is this disinfo?
[00:50:43.241 --> 00:50:44.762]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:50:45.722 --> 00:50:48.044]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:51.528 --> 00:50:52.929]  It is a big idea.
[00:50:52.949 --> 00:50:55.050]  A New World Order.
[00:50:55.750 --> 00:51:00.192]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:51:00.253 --> 00:51:03.454]  It's known as the Builderberg Group.
[00:51:03.494 --> 00:51:05.715]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:51:06.276 --> 00:51:08.717]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:51:09.457 --> 00:51:16.781]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:51:19.781 --> 00:51:24.783]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:51:25.243 --> 00:51:28.725]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:51:29.105 --> 00:51:31.606]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:51:31.666 --> 00:51:32.827]  Most people have no idea.
[00:51:32.847 --> 00:51:33.607]  They're not after money.
[00:51:33.627 --> 00:51:34.687]  They have all the money they need.
[00:51:34.907 --> 00:51:35.628]  They're after power.
[00:51:35.888 --> 00:51:36.708]  That's what they're after.

[00:51:48.553 --> 00:51:49.796]  You have been warned.
[00:51:53.644 --> 00:51:55.568]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:56.049 --> 00:51:58.814]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:05.387 --> 00:52:06.028]  Big Brother.
[00:52:06.709 --> 00:52:07.750]  Mainstream media.
[00:52:08.471 --> 00:52:09.572]  Government cover-ups.
[00:52:10.233 --> 00:52:11.054]  You want answers?
[00:52:11.815 --> 00:52:12.676]  Well, so does he.
[00:52:13.377 --> 00:52:17.062]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:17.562 --> 00:52:21.608]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:52:25.185 --> 00:52:26.447]  We're now into the third hour.
[00:52:26.467 --> 00:52:32.015]  I want to get into the power structure of the New World Order from Robert Galen Ross' research briefly later in this hour.
[00:52:32.035 --> 00:52:41.188]  I also want to get his take on what a depression will look like versus just a serious inflationary recession, how long he thinks that'll go.
[00:52:42.209 --> 00:52:43.911]  Yeah, Alex, can I go off topic?
[00:53:06.665 --> 00:53:08.707]  I'm sure that Robert Allen Ross can talk about any subject.
[00:53:08.767 --> 00:53:09.087]  Go ahead.
[00:53:09.107 --> 00:53:10.648]  Okay, there's three things I want to mention.
[00:53:10.968 --> 00:53:13.330]  I did the math on the square footage of Florida.
[00:53:14.151 --> 00:53:18.934]  And do you realize we could put 7 billion people in Florida and each would have 20 square feet?
[00:53:19.635 --> 00:53:21.096]  We're not overcrowded in this world.
[00:53:22.017 --> 00:53:26.100]  The second thing I wanted to mention, I wanted to ask you, Alex, is the Fourth Amendment still valid?
[00:53:27.429 --> 00:53:32.510]  The Fourth Amendment has been abolished under H.R.
[00:53:32.530 --> 00:53:32.510]  3162.
[00:53:33.010 --> 00:53:44.573]  The criminals have to still act like it's there, and still some people in government who aren't criminals but live in delusional la-la land think that it's still in force.
[00:53:46.094 --> 00:53:51.115]  The Fourth Amendment, as you know, only points out an innate organic
[00:53:52.119 --> 00:53:54.220]  Or what many call God-given right.
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:55.800]  I mean, I don't care what the government says.
[00:53:56.181 --> 00:53:59.002]  You know, the president can't barbecue babies on the White House lawn.
[00:53:59.342 --> 00:54:01.363]  That is inhumane, inhuman, criminal.
[00:54:01.843 --> 00:54:05.944]  It doesn't matter if he says he's supreme dictator and allowed to order the torture of children.
[00:54:05.964 --> 00:54:06.705]  You need to be serious.
[00:54:07.865 --> 00:54:14.148]  And so, but yeah, by and large, the government ignores the Fourth Amendment and says it doesn't exist.
[00:54:14.668 --> 00:54:14.968]  Okay.
[00:54:15.028 --> 00:54:16.008]  You want to comment on that, Robert?
[00:54:16.048 --> 00:54:19.850]  I wanted to say is on CNN today, I actually seen that a man
[00:54:20.550 --> 00:54:26.533]  Got put in jail for six months because his 18-year-old daughter failed her GED.
[00:54:26.933 --> 00:54:28.894]  Oh, yeah.
[00:54:28.954 --> 00:54:30.955]  This started about 10 years ago in Houston.
[00:54:31.315 --> 00:54:32.476]  It's all over the country.
[00:54:33.497 --> 00:54:34.817]  You have to stay in school.
[00:54:34.837 --> 00:54:35.918]  You're not allowed to drop out.
[00:54:36.498 --> 00:54:40.540]  And now the parents are given prison time if they don't.
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:43.862]  Look, if you drop a banana peel, six months in jail.
[00:54:44.022 --> 00:54:46.423]  If you batter in your backyard, five years.
[00:54:47.163 --> 00:54:48.164]  This is the new system.
[00:54:48.964 --> 00:54:51.286]  Robert Gillin Ross, it's always been that way in tyranny.
[00:54:51.546 --> 00:54:54.189]  They always make laws for the common people, don't they?
[00:54:54.209 --> 00:54:56.511]  That's right, and laws don't apply to them at all.
[00:54:58.472 --> 00:55:01.154]  So for us, there's hyper-laws, but for them, there's no laws.
[00:55:01.335 --> 00:55:05.078]  Yeah, for example, probably the best example is bribery.
[00:55:05.658 --> 00:55:09.621]  If you go down and you give a judge some money, you can go to jail for bribery.
[00:55:10.102 --> 00:55:17.128]  But if a politician, if somebody drops several hundred thousand dollars in his pocket, that's a campaign finance.
[00:55:17.668 --> 00:55:18.468]  Well, here's an example.
[00:55:18.508 --> 00:55:22.990]  They can even break those laws that are tailored for them, and it's all selectively enforced.
[00:55:23.410 --> 00:55:26.991]  Hillary and McCain both went to England in the last six months.
[00:55:27.371 --> 00:55:30.492]  They both raised hundreds of thousands of dollars at Lord Rothschild's house.
[00:55:30.852 --> 00:55:31.952]  You think I'm joking, folks.
[00:55:31.972 --> 00:55:33.793]  Just type McCain Rothschild into Google.
[00:55:33.833 --> 00:55:34.613]  It's Times of London.
[00:55:35.053 --> 00:55:36.354]  They gave him hundreds of thousands.
[00:55:36.474 --> 00:55:40.095]  It said that one dollar is a felony for a foreigner in a foreign country.
[00:55:40.175 --> 00:55:41.695]  And McCain just said, I don't care.
[00:55:41.975 --> 00:55:43.196]  And the Fed said, that's right.
[00:55:43.336 --> 00:55:44.156]  We're going to let him do it.
[00:55:44.176 --> 00:55:44.696]  That's right.
[00:55:44.836 --> 00:55:46.717]  I mean, we've entered a new era here.
[00:55:47.185 --> 00:55:54.029]  Yeah, and we're not going to get all this back until we get rid of the two-party system.
[00:55:54.609 --> 00:56:01.413]  We've got to have independent people in every elected position that are there to look out after the people they represent.
[00:56:01.853 --> 00:56:11.799]  I remember debating a guy like ten years ago on a talk show in Florida, speaking of the devil, and he was saying that Rothschilds don't exist, that that's a made-up code race word.
[00:56:12.299 --> 00:56:14.140]  I mean, that's what they... I'm not kidding!
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:21.004]  It's just, we know the world, we study documents all day, we spend our time knowing what's going on, and then they just say, doesn't exist!
[00:56:21.684 --> 00:56:32.050]  If you go to my book, The Elite Don't Dare Let Us Tell People, I list all of the Rothschilds that are over the age of 50, and what they own and their position.
[00:56:32.650 --> 00:56:33.991]  And it's all right there for you.
[00:56:35.685 --> 00:56:37.668]  Okay, well I appreciate your call, George.
[00:56:37.708 --> 00:56:38.188]  Good point.
[00:56:38.328 --> 00:56:42.513]  Scott, Dave, Mary, Fred, we'll go straight back to you in just three minutes.
[00:56:43.093 --> 00:56:57.229]  And there's so much I want to talk about with Robert Galen Ross today that we're going to do some behind-the-scenes talk for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers at the 20 after, 24 after, so you'll want to go to the InfoWars.com streams to listen if you want to hear that behind-the-scenes stuff.
[00:57:01.084 --> 00:57:02.765]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:57:03.045 --> 00:57:06.507]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:57:06.667 --> 00:57:08.888]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:57:08.968 --> 00:57:11.849]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:57:12.149 --> 00:57:17.632]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:57:17.892 --> 00:57:21.794]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[00:58:04.168 --> 00:58:06.309]  We're already under a scientific dictatorship.
[00:58:06.509 --> 00:58:09.711]  Martial law is coming, but it's not going to arrive overnight.
[00:58:10.011 --> 00:58:11.812]  It's going to be incremental.
[00:58:11.992 --> 00:58:13.713]  This country is already teetering on the edge.
[00:58:13.973 --> 00:58:16.815]  Any incident, small or large, could trigger a total takeover.
[00:58:17.055 --> 00:58:18.196]  Anything could be the final push.
[00:58:18.516 --> 00:58:24.299]  Visit SurviveMartialLaw.com and download the e-book full of information that will prepare you for life under total military control.

[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:32.282]  Learn how to act around controlling troops, and how to use their own psychology against them through social engineering.
[00:58:32.602 --> 00:58:38.925]  When Martial Law is officially announced, checkpoints will be enforced, gun confiscations will occur for registered gun owners, and cities will be on lockdown.
[00:58:39.205 --> 00:58:42.747]  You will be dealing with a force that has been in training for years, preparing for this takeover.
[00:58:43.067 --> 00:58:43.487]  We're good.
[00:59:01.278 --> 00:59:05.560]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:59:05.801 --> 00:59:10.803]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:59:10.883 --> 00:59:12.284]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.

[01:00:02.210 --> 01:00:08.252]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:08.852 --> 01:00:11.893]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:12.473 --> 01:00:15.834]  I want the listeners to know that I really appreciate you.
[01:00:15.854 --> 01:00:17.974]  I was thinking about this last night.
[01:00:18.875 --> 01:00:24.576]  My wife's got XM in her car and I was driving her car and I was listening to some George Strait song.
[01:00:25.176 --> 01:00:26.837]  They had a George Strait channel on there.
[01:00:28.270 --> 01:00:31.511]  I couldn't get out of the car last night once I got home at one in the morning after working.
[01:00:32.172 --> 01:00:33.272]  Alright, now I'm really digressing.
[01:00:33.292 --> 01:00:36.173]  I was listening to these George Strait top 56 hits.
[01:00:36.213 --> 01:00:38.754]  He's now got more hits than anybody in any genre.
[01:00:39.815 --> 01:00:41.135]  That really doesn't matter, does it folks?
[01:00:41.155 --> 01:00:46.938]  But the point is, I'm listening to George Strait, but he had this song about, you know, wanting to
[01:00:48.191 --> 01:00:53.218]  Talk to people or tell people, I forget the name of it, after they died, what he wished he could have told them before.
[01:00:53.238 --> 01:00:55.420]  But that's what I want to tell the listeners.
[01:00:55.461 --> 01:01:03.531]  I appreciate you and I appreciate everything you do and I appreciate all the support and I'm sorry that I blow up on air and freak out.
[01:01:04.472 --> 01:01:10.854]  And sometimes they're rude or whatever, but I really care and I'm really freaked out because I'm not some shrinking violin.
[01:01:10.874 --> 01:01:13.015]  I'm not even some goody two-shoes in my life.
[01:01:13.715 --> 01:01:21.358]  Maybe it's because growing up I saw some, you know, kind of the other side of things just happened to run into that, that I have been a little bit
[01:01:22.705 --> 01:01:24.708]  Harder in my life, in just a few respects.
[01:01:24.748 --> 01:01:27.171]  I'm not saying I'm a tough guy.
[01:01:27.291 --> 01:01:38.104]  But to me, it's just so shocking to see the public dumbed down, mindless, in denial, giggling, smirking, laughing, having no idea it's so criminal.
[01:01:39.073 --> 01:01:40.233]  And that things are so bad.
[01:01:40.553 --> 01:01:45.355]  And to see the police so trained against the people.
[01:01:46.155 --> 01:01:46.975]  And I don't hate them.
[01:01:47.055 --> 01:01:51.557]  I know they're being used and manipulated and controlled and brainwashed and there's whole handbooks on it.
[01:01:51.577 --> 01:01:52.657]  And I want to reach out to them.
[01:01:52.737 --> 01:01:54.357]  I want their families to have good futures.
[01:01:54.797 --> 01:01:55.778]  I want them to do well.
[01:01:56.938 --> 01:02:01.600]  And then I studied the New World Order, and just how evil they are boggles the mind.
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:06.143]  But when you know about serial killers and the mindset of control freaks, it really makes sense.
[01:02:06.163 --> 01:02:08.104]  And when you know history, it really makes sense.
[01:02:08.124 --> 01:02:12.726]  We're about to go back to your calls, but Robert Galen Ross, do you ever marvel
[01:02:13.406 --> 01:02:16.630]  At just the horrible, diabolical things they do.
[01:02:16.690 --> 01:02:19.793]  And do you ever feel panicked that you want to warn people?
[01:02:19.853 --> 01:02:26.681]  I mean, I sometimes want to start yelling in the middle of a grocery store, but I know that people have been preconditioned that, you know, you're crazy if you do that.
[01:02:27.762 --> 01:02:29.524]  We don't have the town criers anymore.
[01:02:29.564 --> 01:02:30.505]  People want a soapbox.
[01:02:31.586 --> 01:02:33.707]  If you try to do that in England now, they arrest you.
[01:02:33.847 --> 01:02:37.029]  I mean, I'm really kind of babbling here.
[01:02:37.049 --> 01:02:39.750]  I'm just putting out my thoughts that I don't claim to be the best at this.
[01:02:39.790 --> 01:02:41.691]  I don't claim to be the Grand Poobah.
[01:02:41.751 --> 01:02:43.111]  I don't claim to have all the answers.
[01:02:43.532 --> 01:02:45.833]  All I know is this new world order is coming down on us.
[01:02:46.293 --> 01:02:48.074]  I'm trying to tell the truth the best I can.
[01:02:48.114 --> 01:02:50.035]  I'm trying to get people rallied to fight against it.
[01:02:50.735 --> 01:02:52.616]  And I see our own movement fighting with each other.
[01:02:52.636 --> 01:02:53.676]  That makes me very sad.
[01:02:53.696 --> 01:02:57.018]  I know that's inevitable, but do you get the point I'm making?
[01:02:57.819 --> 01:03:00.260]  Yeah, Alex, I'm like you.
[01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:07.122]  I'm absolutely convinced you have dedicated the rest of your life to trying to expose all this, and that's exactly the way I am.
[01:03:08.083 --> 01:03:12.925]  If we don't do this, our children, our grandchildren, their quality of life is going to be terrible.
[01:03:13.725 --> 01:03:16.826]  And it's really our responsibility to do that.
[01:03:17.086 --> 01:03:20.027]  You can't divorce yourself from your kids like that.
[01:03:20.607 --> 01:03:22.008]  You've got to protect them.
[01:03:22.848 --> 01:03:25.110]  And the only way we can do that is try to get the truth out.
[01:03:25.330 --> 01:03:26.351]  Well, that's what it comes down to.
[01:03:26.391 --> 01:03:32.236]  I look at my children, and I image these grandchildren that I know will be here next week, and that's how time flies.
[01:03:32.256 --> 01:03:33.797]  We were talking about that during the break.
[01:03:33.817 --> 01:03:37.000]  Your son's 40-something years old now, and you remember holding him as a baby.
[01:03:38.561 --> 01:03:40.383]  Talk about how time flies, because it really does.
[01:03:40.703 --> 01:03:54.589]  Yeah, my son is adopted and they brought him to us when he was five days old and brought him in this little blanket and I looked in his eyes and of course that killed me right off.
[01:03:54.669 --> 01:03:57.550]  I mean that was instant bonding.
[01:03:58.330 --> 01:04:00.491]  But now he's over 46 years old.
[01:04:02.672 --> 01:04:04.373]  And I'm going to go see him in a couple of weeks.
[01:04:04.553 --> 01:04:09.177]  But I've missed so much time with him.
[01:04:10.077 --> 01:04:12.719]  Also, I missed time with my own father and my own mother.
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:18.823]  When I was making my way through industry, I ignored them.
[01:04:18.903 --> 01:04:20.765]  I didn't go to visit them like I should.
[01:04:20.785 --> 01:04:25.548]  And I look back and these were some of the finest people I've ever known in my life.
[01:04:26.469 --> 01:04:27.169]  And I ignored them.
[01:04:27.289 --> 01:04:27.970]  And don't do that.
[01:04:29.136 --> 01:04:32.940]  It's very important that the people you love give them the time.
[01:04:46.195 --> 01:04:48.316]  A few hours a day with my children, but that's not enough.
[01:04:48.937 --> 01:04:51.699]  I work most weekends, and I'm not whining about this.
[01:04:51.719 --> 01:04:52.899]  I'm talking about the process.
[01:04:53.220 --> 01:05:01.825]  That's another reason I hate the New World Order so much, is that I have to totally fight them all the time, and I know they're so evil, and if more good people get involved and fight evil,
[01:05:03.306 --> 01:05:07.949]  We wouldn't be in such dire straits, and I have to admit, I get mad at the general public who are in denial.
[01:05:07.969 --> 01:05:11.752]  You know, who tell me there's no such thing as Rothschilds, or no such thing as New World Order.
[01:05:11.772 --> 01:05:14.233]  I mean, I get that all the time, and I really want to slap them!
[01:05:14.694 --> 01:05:21.298]  I mean, these are hardcore killers coming for them, and they are living in denial, and I'm sick of it!
[01:05:22.018 --> 01:05:27.442]  Yeah, the people behind all of this, the ones behind the curtain, are hardened criminals.
[01:05:27.862 --> 01:05:29.203]  They don't care about anybody.
[01:05:29.884 --> 01:05:30.804]  They're greedy.
[01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:35.881]  They don't care how many people are killed in wars.
[01:05:35.921 --> 01:05:36.822]  They create wars.
[01:05:36.882 --> 01:05:40.023]  They finance both sides of wars, all for their own benefit.
[01:05:40.804 --> 01:05:43.985]  And like you, I really get pissed off.
[01:05:45.546 --> 01:05:49.328]  But I've got to be careful that I don't lose my objective.
[01:05:50.208 --> 01:05:54.250]  I don't want to lose my tunnel vision of exposing all of this.
[01:05:55.111 --> 01:06:00.774]  And I'm going to spend all my time, all the spare time I can, exposing these evil people.
[01:06:01.752 --> 01:06:02.713]  Let's go back to the calls.
[01:06:02.753 --> 01:06:04.253]  Let's talk to Scott in Colorado.
[01:06:04.273 --> 01:06:05.074]  You're on the air, Scott.
[01:06:07.035 --> 01:06:07.255]  Hey, Alex.
[01:06:07.275 --> 01:06:07.775]  Can you hear me?
[01:06:07.855 --> 01:06:08.215]  Yes, sir.
[01:06:08.716 --> 01:06:09.576]  Hey, I'm just like you.
[01:06:09.596 --> 01:06:17.560]  I get very passionate about what the message I'm trying to convey, and a lot of times it makes it a little harder because they kind of push away from me.
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:19.361]  But anyway, just a couple of points.
[01:06:19.421 --> 01:06:21.102]  I don't want to take much from Mr. Ross today.
[01:06:21.162 --> 01:06:25.924]  I'll keep one of the issues I wanted to discuss with you until another time.
[01:06:26.825 --> 01:06:30.727]  You were talking earlier, though, about genetic engineering.
[01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:41.367]  And one of the things that they're doing right now, and I think I may have even read this in one of your articles somewhere, but I have had, I've actually worked with, this is called apoptosis?
[01:06:42.027 --> 01:06:42.888]  Are you familiar with that term?
[01:06:43.268 --> 01:06:43.528]  Yes.
[01:06:43.728 --> 01:06:44.268]  Okay.
[01:06:44.569 --> 01:06:45.509]  Programmed cell death.
[01:06:46.270 --> 01:06:52.774]  And what they can do is go in and target certain cells of the human body and program them to live a shorter period of time.
[01:06:52.794 --> 01:07:00.519]  So they can program in a shorter period of time for specific organs that are necessary to not last as long.
[01:07:01.255 --> 01:07:07.160]  And I think that may be something that they are working on currently.
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:10.182]  I actually have a little involvement with some studies.
[01:07:11.763 --> 01:07:21.471]  Now we've had life extension experts on and certainly all the good things that industry and science discovers, with well-meaning researchers doing it, is compartmentalized.
[01:07:21.831 --> 01:07:29.177]  That has been sent back to the big boys who already have very serious life extension technologies that they've been suppressing.
[01:07:29.937 --> 01:07:30.978]  Robert Gellin Ross, your take on that?
[01:07:31.058 --> 01:07:35.841]  Yeah, they're after us from every direction.
[01:07:36.541 --> 01:07:40.684]  For example, one of their goals is to depopulate the world.
[01:07:41.124 --> 01:07:42.445]  They say there's too many eaters.
[01:07:43.585 --> 01:07:47.288]  Something like six billion people in the world, they say it ought to be two billion or less.
[01:07:47.988 --> 01:07:52.891]  And so they're literally trying to depopulate Africa for one major example.
[01:07:53.491 --> 01:08:10.315]  And I want people listening to know, when I get up on air and just throw out the warning, hey, fluoride eats holes in your brains, attacks every organ, or when I say every major vaccine's been found to be filled with different cancer viruses and different artificially created data packets, whatever you want to call them, artificial viruses that are
[01:08:10.635 --> 01:08:23.040]  Programming you at certain hormonal fluctuations and certain ages that will kill you, that I've had scientists, doctors, medical people on, government documents, EPA, toxicologists.
[01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:24.300]  This is going on.
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:25.020]  You want to speak to that?
[01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:28.922]  Yeah, and they have what they call nanobots.
[01:08:29.942 --> 01:08:45.535]  This is actually physical beings that they can, they're small enough that they can inject it into your blood system and sometime in the future they can turn those nanobots on and are they there for good or are they there for bad?
[01:08:46.216 --> 01:08:50.360]  Well they're talking about people don't trust the government anymore, they're not taking vaccines.
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:52.361]  We'll just engineer it into the potatoes.
[01:08:53.282 --> 01:08:56.765]  I mean, see, it's just, it's this forced medication.
[01:08:56.825 --> 01:08:57.726]  Anything else, Scott?
[01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:16.996]  Real quick, I want to go ahead and, I guess, I'm not really ashamed to plug, but we had talked about before, I made that video of the Colorado Springs fire drill, and since we're talking about martial law and what's going on, we have 30,000 troops moving into Colorado Springs to Fort Carson right now.
[01:09:17.016 --> 01:09:18.717]  And I'll tell you, it really concerns me.
[01:09:19.118 --> 01:09:24.362]  But I just want to, anyway, bring that up again so more people can take a look at what they're doing behind the scenes.
[01:09:24.702 --> 01:09:25.042]  Sure, sure.
[01:09:25.102 --> 01:09:26.283]  We've seen that video.
[01:09:26.323 --> 01:09:27.444]  Thank you so much for that call.
[01:09:27.524 --> 01:09:28.965]  I just want to be careful.
[01:09:29.005 --> 01:09:33.309]  A lot of people think there's going to be an overnight martial law.
[01:09:41.855 --> 01:09:42.616]  It's incremental.
[01:09:43.036 --> 01:09:45.338]  I mean, getting randomly pulled over by the cops is martial law.
[01:09:46.239 --> 01:09:48.060]  Random checkpoints is martial law.
[01:09:48.141 --> 01:09:52.164]  Curfews is martial law, which they're now putting in for adults in many cities.
[01:09:52.985 --> 01:09:57.449]  All of this, cops telling you that there's free speech zones, that's martial law.
[01:09:58.329 --> 01:09:59.890]  It's what, increment of martial law.
[01:09:59.910 --> 01:10:01.770]  So everybody's looking for this big overnight thing.
[01:10:02.570 --> 01:10:09.893]  Listen, going from 300,000 cops to 2 million cops, and having 10% of the college grads being Homeland Security related, that's martial law right there.
[01:10:10.113 --> 01:10:12.193]  Getting rid of posse commentatus is martial law.
[01:10:12.554 --> 01:10:16.535]  They just put the gun to your head, they've taken the safety off, are they going to pull the trigger?
[01:10:16.995 --> 01:10:18.596]  That's a 10 on a Richter scale.
[01:10:18.936 --> 01:10:19.816]  Robert, comments on that?
[01:10:20.576 --> 01:10:22.617]  It goes back to the old frog in the pan.
[01:10:23.477 --> 01:10:30.025]  As they gradually turn the heat up, the frog just sits there because it's really nice, it's warm, and before you know it, he's cooked.
[01:10:30.786 --> 01:10:34.050]  But if you throw him in a pot of boiling water, he'll jump out.
[01:10:34.591 --> 01:10:35.211]  Yep, that's it.
[01:10:35.251 --> 01:10:36.573]  Let's go to Dave in Wisconsin.
[01:10:36.593 --> 01:10:37.174]  Dave, you're on the air.
[01:10:39.301 --> 01:10:39.581]  Hello.
[01:10:40.121 --> 01:10:47.744]  I just wanted to say that the Son of God is recorded as saying, for the love of money is the root of all evil.
[01:10:48.265 --> 01:10:58.529]  And I tried to think that through a little bit, and really, anything to do with money management, whether it's in a personal life or a meeting with bankers, has to do with the occult.
[01:10:59.289 --> 01:11:20.253]  And I just finished a book by, um, let's see, uh, Elizabeth Starr Miller, or Lady Queensborough by her other name, called Occult Theocracy, and it says in there, on page 581, for the purposes of occult dominion, minds must therefore be rendered passive and negative in order that control can be achieved.
[01:11:20.913 --> 01:11:25.574]  Minds consciously working to a definite end for good are of power.
[01:11:26.437 --> 01:11:31.796]  The scheme for world dominion might be doomed by the recognition of this principle alone.
[01:11:32.509 --> 01:11:34.430]  I just wanted to make that point and also... Well, stay there.
[01:11:34.450 --> 01:11:35.250]  I'm going to come back to you.
[01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:37.212]  I'm going to come... Dave, stay there.
[01:11:37.252 --> 01:11:39.052]  In fact, I'm going to talk to you during the break.
[01:11:39.073 --> 01:11:48.217]  We're going to give you four minutes during the break and a large portion of the audience and folks watching on the web at PrisonPlanet.tv will be able to hear you on the other side.
[01:11:48.237 --> 01:11:49.378]  So we're going to break for the network.
[01:11:49.398 --> 01:11:54.421]  We're going to do four minutes on the behind the scenes for people listening on the InfoWars.com streams.
[01:11:54.801 --> 01:11:56.142]  But yes, you bring up a key point.
[01:11:56.222 --> 01:11:56.682]  Stay with us.
[01:12:00.993 --> 01:12:04.897]  Okay, let me go ahead and talk to Dave in Wisconsin some more.
[01:12:04.917 --> 01:12:06.158]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[01:12:06.698 --> 01:12:11.763]  Yeah, for those that are out there watching, let me just make my point, and I'll let you make yours, and then I want to get Robert Galen Ross' take on this.
[01:12:11.903 --> 01:12:20.751]  People think of the occult as somebody, a witch with a pointed hat, stirring a black pot, and that certainly is a druidic angle out of Europe.
[01:12:21.771 --> 01:12:24.433]  But the main manifestation was government statecraft.
[01:12:24.773 --> 01:12:32.979]  How the Babylonians, how the Egyptians manipulated the population, how they used symbols, how they created fractional reserve banking.
[01:12:33.399 --> 01:12:35.581]  And they did call mathematics magic.
[01:12:35.941 --> 01:12:40.264]  So you're right, the occultists have a true college or formulae.
[01:12:40.644 --> 01:12:42.606]  That's why the quote, occult, gives you power.
[01:12:43.947 --> 01:12:45.148]  Not the ooga booga part.
[01:12:45.368 --> 01:12:49.792]  That's to get lower level people to come to your sex party and use drugs so they'll join your church.
[01:12:50.973 --> 01:12:57.619]  But for the initiates of the real occult, it is all about how humans behave, how humans operate.
[01:12:57.899 --> 01:13:02.783]  Getting outside and seeing yourself from the outside and looking at yourself like a machine.
[01:13:03.684 --> 01:13:06.326]  And so you're right to say that modern banking is the occult.
[01:13:06.627 --> 01:13:07.427]  Because what is the occult?
[01:13:07.487 --> 01:13:08.228]  It's like a magician.
[01:13:08.508 --> 01:13:09.489]  That comes out of the occult.
[01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:11.391]  It's a religion.
[01:13:12.131 --> 01:13:13.593]  It's ooga-booga.
[01:13:13.973 --> 01:13:21.139]  And so for them, they are the masters, the rulers, because out of nothing, out of fiat currency, they own your family.
[01:13:21.179 --> 01:13:23.101]  The cops will kill your children for a paycheck.
[01:13:23.461 --> 01:13:28.826]  They get everything because they have this occult money, which is a lie.
[01:13:31.509 --> 01:13:32.571]  It's not real money.
[01:13:33.012 --> 01:13:34.133]  It is an occult symbol.
[01:13:34.153 --> 01:13:34.494]  Go ahead.
[01:13:35.175 --> 01:13:37.619]  In a way, it's the veil that's spoken of in scripture.
[01:13:37.679 --> 01:13:39.582]  It's the ooga booga, if you will, the fraud.
[01:13:41.792 --> 01:13:45.435]  But anyway, there's a couple of other books that I read just recently.
[01:13:46.296 --> 01:13:47.718]  Of course, Occult Theocracy.
[01:13:47.778 --> 01:13:50.580]  I recommend that for everyone, but especially for Christians.
[01:13:51.101 --> 01:13:55.385]  And Be Wise as Serpents by Fritz Springmeier goes into great detail in this.
[01:13:55.945 --> 01:14:00.850]  And a book, incidentally, that I mailed to you, and I'm wondering if you received it, called Hidden Secrets of the Alpha.
[01:14:00.930 --> 01:14:01.311]  Of course.
[01:14:01.391 --> 01:14:02.632]  Did you receive that, Mr. Jones?
[01:14:02.653 --> 01:14:04.115]  Yeah, I received about ten bucks a day.
[01:14:04.135 --> 01:14:10.324]  I don't want to discourage people from sending me books if somebody around here reads it, but I think I saw that laying around.
[01:14:10.384 --> 01:14:14.009]  I'm making three films right now, and so I haven't read it.
[01:14:15.444 --> 01:14:17.665]  Hey, I appreciate you sending that and I appreciate your call.
[01:14:18.005 --> 01:14:21.066]  Robert Galen Ross, you want to comment on what Dave in Wisconsin was just saying?
[01:14:21.246 --> 01:14:29.269]  Yeah, probably the apex of the example of occult is when you and Mike slipped in the Bohemian Grove.
[01:14:29.829 --> 01:14:32.450]  That was a major revolution of the occult.
[01:14:33.030 --> 01:14:34.710]  And you caught them on camera.
[01:14:36.531 --> 01:14:38.272]  And it showed that the elite are not invincible.
[01:14:38.332 --> 01:14:40.533]  People think that was staged, or they let us in.
[01:14:40.713 --> 01:14:42.834]  I assure you, if they did, I didn't know it.
[01:14:43.334 --> 01:14:46.455]  I was, you know, I snuck in, I got questioned, I hid out.
[01:14:46.755 --> 01:14:49.456]  People then said, well, why didn't you walk up and ask them to take their mask off?
[01:14:49.516 --> 01:14:55.139]  Like I wouldn't have been arrested instantly, as all the other CBS reporters and People Magazine reporters were.
[01:14:56.199 --> 01:14:58.600]  So I snuck in, got in, hid out, got the video.
[01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:00.821]  The point is, the elite is not invincible.
[01:15:01.201 --> 01:15:03.362]  So many listeners see them as invincible.
[01:15:03.682 --> 01:15:05.963]  No, two ragtag guys were able to sneak in.
[01:15:06.283 --> 01:15:11.847]  Yeah, you just kind of walked in and acted like you belonged there, and nobody questioned you.
[01:15:12.267 --> 01:15:19.452]  Well, they got questioned a few times, but then I knew enough about the camps to say, oh, I'm part of this camp, and then I got in the woods and hid out until it got dark, but yeah.
[01:15:19.492 --> 01:15:24.316]  Yeah, but that is probably the best public example of the occult.
[01:15:25.036 --> 01:15:26.857]  And I encourage everybody to get a copy of that.
[01:15:27.257 --> 01:15:28.878]  If you haven't seen it, or don't have a copy.
[01:15:29.138 --> 01:15:30.558]  Yeah, I never plugged that.
[01:15:30.578 --> 01:15:37.561]  The definitive work, a 45-minute film we made in 2005 called Order of Death, that's all the latest.
[01:15:37.621 --> 01:15:39.782]  The second infiltration by a new guy who went in.
[01:15:39.822 --> 01:15:41.502]  They went ahead and set him up on some charges.
[01:15:41.522 --> 01:15:42.343]  He's in prison now.
[01:15:43.483 --> 01:15:46.064]  And then the original film re-edited and remastered.
[01:15:46.084 --> 01:15:48.945]  So two films, 1995 on one DVD.
[01:15:49.545 --> 01:15:53.647]  Order of Death, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, combo, two films on one DVD.
[01:15:54.227 --> 01:15:56.491]  Yeah, if you don't have that, get a copy of it.
[01:15:56.551 --> 01:15:59.795]  It's very important that you see that because you need to see it with your own eyes.
[01:15:59.815 --> 01:16:02.139]  Alright, we're going live right now to the main audience.
[01:16:02.159 --> 01:16:02.419]  Here we go.
[01:16:11.281 --> 01:16:22.283]  You know, Robert, if I had time, that's where I'd be.
[01:16:22.323 --> 01:16:28.684]  I'd be down in Big Bend, going across to the Mexico side, Boquillas, those huge caves and mountains, just something out of a movie.
[01:16:29.064 --> 01:16:31.565]  Or I'd be in Monument Valley, or I'd be up north in Alaska.
[01:16:32.265 --> 01:16:34.508]  Up there in the summer, prospecting around.
[01:16:34.928 --> 01:16:39.353]  I'd go up there and camp for a month, but I've got to stay here in the Infowars.com command bunker.
[01:16:39.853 --> 01:16:44.838]  The fellow was bringing up during the break for behind the scenes listeners, the occultism.
[01:16:45.539 --> 01:16:48.442]  An occult isn't just a witch in a black cauldron.
[01:16:48.723 --> 01:16:50.024]  That's kind of the archetypal image.
[01:16:50.104 --> 01:16:52.206]  It is the system of control of populations.
[01:16:52.567 --> 01:16:53.508]  And it is alchemy.
[01:16:54.088 --> 01:16:55.149]  It is a fraud.
[01:16:55.249 --> 01:16:56.510]  It is a magic.
[01:16:57.331 --> 01:16:58.572]  Magic's just tricking somebody.
[01:16:59.353 --> 01:17:10.023]  To be able to have private banks that just create money out of nothing and own our governments, own our police, and we all bow down for the real things that can be bought with the fiat.
[01:17:10.763 --> 01:17:11.004]  Yep.
[01:17:12.665 --> 01:17:13.306]  Just amazing.
[01:17:15.006 --> 01:17:15.887]  And it's getting worse.
[01:17:17.468 --> 01:17:22.751]  And I advise you to do everything you can to prepare what's coming.
[01:17:23.331 --> 01:17:28.875]  And probably the best thing you can do is eliminate as much debt as you can.
[01:17:28.895 --> 01:17:33.858]  And if you have anything left over, invest in gold.
[01:17:35.078 --> 01:17:38.821]  But you need to look out for your family or your friends.
[01:17:39.801 --> 01:17:42.123]  And it's really going to get bad.
[01:17:43.732 --> 01:17:44.892]  You know what, this is a short segment.
[01:17:44.912 --> 01:17:50.335]  We'll come back and go to Mary, Fred, Lee, Rob, Ronnie, and others in quick succession.
[01:17:50.375 --> 01:17:59.578]  But right now, let's talk about A. What do you think the chances are that we're going to have a depression versus just a hyperinflationary deep recession?
[01:18:00.419 --> 01:18:02.440]  And B. When do you think that will happen?
[01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:07.842]  And C. What will it look like if it does happen?
[01:18:08.683 --> 01:18:20.427]  Well, we're absolutely in a recession now, and if we don't pull out by the end of 2009, we're going into a deep depression, so watch that very carefully.
[01:18:20.467 --> 01:18:21.528]  Look for the trends in 2009.
[01:18:22.028 --> 01:18:24.609]  And the trends are going towards depression.
[01:18:24.649 --> 01:18:25.009]  That's right.
[01:18:26.059 --> 01:18:30.622]  And it's all based on what the elite are doing to us.
[01:18:31.162 --> 01:18:34.224]  Do that Google search on the MCM money supply.
[01:18:34.264 --> 01:18:36.785]  That's a very important thing to look at.
[01:18:37.605 --> 01:18:43.909]  Because it shows that they're printing money like it's going out of style, and that's driving the cost up of everything that we buy.
[01:18:47.387 --> 01:18:48.668]  And they get to consolidate.
[01:18:48.708 --> 01:18:56.433]  Understand, they implode economies after they get you extended out like a loan shark, and then they get all the real assets in a big bag they put over their shoulder.
[01:18:56.813 --> 01:18:58.354]  Mass global carpet-bagging.
[01:18:58.715 --> 01:18:59.115]  That's right.
[01:19:00.196 --> 01:19:12.544]  And they fleece the public ever so often, and they allow you to gain some assets, and all of a sudden they'll come in and jerk your feet out from under you.
[01:19:13.649 --> 01:19:15.050]  That's been going on for years.
[01:19:15.370 --> 01:19:25.033]  And then the very public that has been ripped off by them will then turn to the same experts to tell them how to get out of it on the news, which will be some new solution that gets them deeper under their control.
[01:19:25.713 --> 01:19:41.419]  And Henry Kissinger said at the, I believe it was 1992 Bilderberg meeting, that we will essentially create a mass fear by the public and then they will welcome us as world leaders to come in and save them.
[01:19:41.479 --> 01:19:49.341]  Yeah, that's a quote from Evian France, and that was confirmed that he said that, and they publicly... I mean, I keep plugging this quote because it's so amazing.
[01:19:49.361 --> 01:19:58.783]  Another guy called in with a Carol Quigley quote from the 60s about how they'd create a North American Union, and how they'd call it a confederation, how they'd call it an integration, how they'd merge it through roads.
[01:19:58.823 --> 01:20:00.724]  I mean, it's all there, but...
[01:20:01.704 --> 01:20:19.396]  The head of the CFR Haas says, we're using fake terror to control you and make you the enemy, and he said, and we're going to use environmentalism as a fad to make humans the enemy, to totally control your life, and quote, make humans the enemy, and we will wage the war against humans.
[01:20:19.456 --> 01:20:21.157]  I mean, this is about hurting you.
[01:20:21.857 --> 01:20:25.520]  And they just publicly say it in the public, thanks and oh, thank you for hurting me!
[01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:28.080]  Let me roll my sleeve up and take an injection.
[01:20:28.321 --> 01:20:29.461]  Oh, you're a Nazi eugenicist.
[01:20:29.541 --> 01:20:30.961]  Oh, let me have a shot.
[01:20:31.061 --> 01:20:31.681]  I trust you.
[01:20:32.962 --> 01:20:36.343]  Yeah, one of the recent fears is global warming.
[01:20:37.563 --> 01:20:45.445]  There's a lot of evidence that the so-called global warming has reversed for the last year, year and a half.
[01:20:46.585 --> 01:20:48.246]  It's getting cooler rather than warmer.
[01:20:50.226 --> 01:20:55.832]  But they won't step up and verify that because they're trying to scare you with global warming.
[01:20:55.872 --> 01:20:57.674]  Well, they say we've got to keep climate stable.
[01:20:58.215 --> 01:20:59.877]  Climate's never been stable on this planet.
[01:20:59.897 --> 01:21:00.297]  That's right.
[01:21:00.477 --> 01:21:05.983]  And all the evidence, every climatologist, every biologist, expert says that a warming planet is better for life.
[01:21:06.664 --> 01:21:14.686]  And that this is the lowest in carbon dioxide and oxygen of the hundreds of thousands of ice core samples going back hundreds of thousands of years they've ever found.
[01:21:15.546 --> 01:21:21.188]  And they've now found in studies that desertification in Sahara is happening because of low carbon dioxide.
[01:21:21.768 --> 01:21:23.068]  Plants need it, folks.
[01:21:23.208 --> 01:21:28.149]  It's not a deadly bio-weapon, chemical weapon, as the news has been saying.
[01:21:28.349 --> 01:21:29.429]  It's a lie, folks.
[01:21:29.489 --> 01:21:30.930]  It's a huge hoax.
[01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:34.431]  I think with the elite, Robert, they love to joke.
[01:21:34.611 --> 01:21:40.112]  I mean, it must be a huge joke to them that the public's running in fear from imaginary terrorists and carbon dioxide.
[01:21:40.652 --> 01:21:44.113]  I'm sure they'd get together and laugh about it, how they're scaring us.
[01:21:44.493 --> 01:21:45.654]  Look at those people running.
[01:21:45.674 --> 01:21:46.534]  Look at them hiding.
[01:21:46.914 --> 01:21:48.434]  Look at them crunching down.
[01:21:48.534 --> 01:21:49.295]  We'll be right back.
[01:21:51.315 --> 01:21:52.235]  We're on the march.
[01:21:52.716 --> 01:21:54.316]  The empire's on the run.
[01:21:55.236 --> 01:21:57.917]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:01.095 --> 01:22:06.240]  The Federal Trade Commission estimates that 9 million Americans are victims of identity theft each year.
[01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:11.204]  The crime of identity theft occurs every 3.5 seconds, costing the victims an average of $8,000.
[01:22:11.324 --> 01:22:19.311]  If you own a PC, passwords are a common form of authentication, and often the only protection between a hacker and your personal information.
[01:22:19.631 --> 01:22:28.255]  Passwords that are stored in a spreadsheet, text file, data file, or any other file that is not encrypted and password protected, are vulnerable to malicious theft and misuse.

[01:23:01.286 --> 01:23:07.173]  Attention GCN listeners, would you like to watch uncensored, unregulated, even banned TV on your computer?
[01:23:07.294 --> 01:23:18.748]  Well now you can watch satellite TV on your PC with an extremely simple hookup that allows computer owners to pick up more channels than any sane person can even watch without paying monthly cable or satellite fees.
[01:23:19.148 --> 01:23:19.989]  Here's the story.
[01:23:20.309 --> 01:23:28.153]  New video feed technology lets anyone with a high-speed internet connection gain instant access to an endless list of underground channels from all over the globe.
[01:23:28.453 --> 01:23:29.514]  And here's the best part.
[01:23:29.614 --> 01:23:30.895]  It's 100% legal.
[01:23:31.315 --> 01:23:37.418]  And it works at home, the office, or even in other countries to grab television channels and video feeds at your command.
[01:23:37.738 --> 01:23:42.021]  GCN listeners can use it to watch hundreds of conspiracy videos absolutely free.
[01:23:42.541 --> 01:23:46.707]  Best of all, you could be watching free TV on your PC in five minutes or less.
[01:23:46.867 --> 01:23:47.688]  It's that simple.
[01:23:47.988 --> 01:23:51.293]  Just go to www.orderfreetv.com.
[01:23:51.613 --> 01:23:54.617]  That's www.orderfreetv.com.
[01:23:54.917 --> 01:24:00.525]  To watch unregulated TV on your PC, go to www.orderfreetv.com.
[01:24:01.457 --> 01:24:04.418]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:24:04.558 --> 01:24:09.799]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:24:10.059 --> 01:24:15.420]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:16.901]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:24:17.261 --> 01:24:26.163]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:24:26.583 --> 01:24:28.204]  Now, compare a Calbin Pure Soap.
[01:24:28.424 --> 01:24:32.586]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[01:25:03.458 --> 01:25:09.720]  The preacher man says it's the end of time, in the Mississippi River she's a-goin' dry.
[01:25:21.288 --> 01:25:28.350]  That's another facet to an economy imploding, is that crime always skyrockets.
[01:25:29.350 --> 01:25:31.251]  People run out of food.
[01:25:31.311 --> 01:25:41.093]  They've got to go to crime in order to feed their families, feed themselves, and provide food and shelter, and it's just going to get worse.
[01:25:41.713 --> 01:25:42.614]  And the government knows that.
[01:25:42.654 --> 01:25:45.415]  That's why they openly want to stop us defending ourselves.
[01:25:45.435 --> 01:25:46.116]  They just love it.
[01:25:46.596 --> 01:25:57.182]  They just love making us these little cowardly domesticated... You got these kids drinking soft drinks full of all this, you know, different dyes and chemicals and sugar and caffeine.
[01:25:57.762 --> 01:26:01.465]  No real exercise, watching TV, playing video games, totally depressed.
[01:26:02.245 --> 01:26:10.049]  But if they were out playing sports or out having to shovel out some horse stalls or out having to work, that actually makes you appreciate your life.
[01:26:10.069 --> 01:26:12.591]  They're totally unhappy because they're not being taught a trade.
[01:26:12.631 --> 01:26:13.711]  They're not being made to work.
[01:26:14.292 --> 01:26:18.894]  You've got all these rich yuppies kids that are totally unhappy, out running around like a bunch of heathens.
[01:26:19.394 --> 01:26:20.315]  And it's simple, folks.
[01:26:20.375 --> 01:26:29.920]  If you don't make your children work and make them clean up the house, and I'm talking to myself right now, it's work to make them work, because it's easier to just do the work yourself sometimes, you're going to ruin them.
[01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:38.808]  And the reason I'm getting off another subject, there's a story here about doctors to remind kids to take their Ritalin via cell phone alerts.
[01:26:39.308 --> 01:26:42.651]  Then soon you'll have to videotape yourself taking the pill to make sure you're taking it.
[01:26:42.971 --> 01:26:48.796]  Associated Press and somebody here on the Infowars.com comment section under the story says,
[01:26:49.983 --> 01:26:52.385]  The parents are popping more pills than the kids.
[01:26:52.465 --> 01:26:58.248]  I have people in my family on 14 different medications and they can't figure out why they feel like crap all the time.
[01:26:58.729 --> 01:27:00.130]  You know what these kids need?
[01:27:00.150 --> 01:27:12.297]  To get away from these fake city slickers and to, you know, go do some farm work every morning and every evening before and after school for a year and see how hyperactive they are.
[01:27:12.698 --> 01:27:15.800]  Have a milk cow kick you in the shoulder and get chased by a thousand pound
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:16.460]  Yes.
[01:27:47.891 --> 01:27:49.038]  It's just there's no wind, Robert.
[01:27:49.861 --> 01:27:55.104]  Well, and also the fast food that they're all consuming leads to obesity.
[01:27:55.604 --> 01:28:04.248]  Obesity leads to other problems that cause life-threatening, like diabetes.
[01:28:05.149 --> 01:28:18.556]  Diabetes, when it really gets to going in the wrong direction, it can cause you to lose your feet, your legs, and so diabetes is directly a function of overweight and obesity.
[01:28:20.333 --> 01:28:22.015]  Well, it's just skyrocketing.
[01:28:22.075 --> 01:28:28.401]  I mean, we had 1 in 33 people in the 1940s, and I have the federal numbers on this, died of cancer.
[01:28:28.441 --> 01:28:29.442]  People lived as long then.
[01:28:29.962 --> 01:28:31.443]  And they smoked and drank even more.
[01:28:31.984 --> 01:28:34.086]  And there was toxic waste all over in the factories.
[01:28:34.967 --> 01:28:36.568]  Why now, magically, is it 1 in 3?
[01:28:38.230 --> 01:28:44.115]  We used to chew on 22 bullets, the lead, and we played with mercury.
[01:28:44.135 --> 01:28:49.400]  I've done so many things like that when I was growing up, and I'm still here.
[01:28:50.321 --> 01:28:52.143]  But I'm sure it caused some problems for me.
[01:28:52.523 --> 01:28:55.204]  Is it now that all this is happening?
[01:28:55.824 --> 01:28:59.825]  Well, I don't think I know the GMO food, it's a cocktail of things, alone.
[01:29:00.225 --> 01:29:06.007]  It creates new amino acids, new things that are toxic waste to the body, and your body doesn't know what it is.
[01:29:06.027 --> 01:29:12.989]  They're creating new cellular structures, new compounds in food that have never existed.
[01:29:13.429 --> 01:29:17.070]  Yeah, and does your immune system attack it because it thinks it's an enemy?
[01:29:17.450 --> 01:29:17.890]  We don't know.
[01:29:19.447 --> 01:29:20.208]  Well, you're right.
[01:29:20.268 --> 01:29:27.815]  We actually do know that it's increasing allergies, and that your body gets hyper-aware, and then it finally just succumbs, and that's when you get cancer.
[01:29:28.575 --> 01:29:31.478]  It basically wears out your immune system, then it just breaks and it's over.
[01:29:31.498 --> 01:29:31.918]  Yeah.
[01:29:32.939 --> 01:29:33.440]  Unbelievable.
[01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:34.501]  Let's take another call here.
[01:29:34.561 --> 01:29:36.663]  Marion, Illinois, you're on the air with Robert Galen Ross.
[01:29:36.683 --> 01:29:37.083]  Go ahead.
[01:29:38.064 --> 01:29:38.905]  Hello.
[01:29:39.085 --> 01:29:39.185]  Hi.
[01:29:39.205 --> 01:29:39.605]  Hello, Marion.
[01:29:39.645 --> 01:29:40.226]  Hi, Alex.
[01:29:40.426 --> 01:29:40.986]  Hi, Robert.
[01:29:41.027 --> 01:29:42.388]  What a pleasure and an honor.
[01:29:43.092 --> 01:29:44.393]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:29:44.893 --> 01:29:47.255]  Actually, I wanted to put some information out there.
[01:29:47.776 --> 01:29:57.863]  I had heard of, yesterday, that a store named Cabela's, it reminds me of the word Cabala, but actually, Cabela's, it's a huge sporting goods store.
[01:29:57.883 --> 01:30:03.027]  They had signed out talking about a homeland security drill.
[01:30:03.167 --> 01:30:08.911]  And I guess they were looking for people supposedly held at the Sears Center.
[01:30:09.151 --> 01:30:12.274]  I called up Cabela's to get some additional information.
[01:30:13.094 --> 01:30:20.617]  And the woman there would seem real excited that they're having this big, you know, Homeland Security, but didn't know too much about it, so they called the Sears Center.
[01:30:21.097 --> 01:30:26.479]  Now this place is a huge place, like, where they would have sporting events.
[01:30:26.559 --> 01:30:28.540]  I thought it was in Chicago, down by the water.
[01:30:28.900 --> 01:30:32.381]  Yeah, this is actually in Hoffman Estate, which is in the center of Chicago.
[01:30:33.181 --> 01:30:36.462]  So, she was very guarded, did not want to say too much about it.
[01:30:36.822 --> 01:30:41.504]  She said, uh, I said, oh, plain kind of stupid, oh, can I get, like, tickets?
[01:30:41.564 --> 01:30:42.164]  Can I watch?
[01:30:42.244 --> 01:30:44.044]  And I guess it's being held inside.
[01:30:44.064 --> 01:30:46.705]  She's like, oh, no, no, we already have the participants.
[01:30:47.285 --> 01:30:49.566]  And it's very heavily guarded.
[01:30:51.104 --> 01:30:53.765]  Yeah, I actually did see something about that.
[01:30:53.985 --> 01:30:57.267]  I'll tell you what, go ahead and make your point and then I'll make mine.
[01:31:12.456 --> 01:31:12.816]  I agree.
[01:31:12.856 --> 01:31:18.965]  People should go and act friendly and say, wow, I'm just interested in this or I'm doing a college report on this.
[01:31:19.827 --> 01:31:22.030]  Why don't you tell me about what happened?
[01:31:22.591 --> 01:31:24.674]  But if you'd like, I can tell you what's going on in there.
[01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:27.201]  I'm very interested.
[01:31:27.221 --> 01:31:28.962]  I'm actually in Grays Lake.
[01:31:28.982 --> 01:31:31.364]  A friend of mine who I met through Ron Paul
[01:31:44.794 --> 01:31:45.796]  We're good to go.
[01:32:01.309 --> 01:32:01.709]  Drill.
[01:32:01.869 --> 01:32:04.491]  He wasn't real specific, but some kind of drill was going on.
[01:32:05.112 --> 01:32:07.193]  And he said it's supposed to be happening this week.
[01:32:07.834 --> 01:32:16.539]  Well, and I thought about it this morning, and I wanted to do a little bit more investigation, and that's when I called the store and called the Sears Center to see if it was in fact happening.
[01:32:17.180 --> 01:32:18.381]  Okay, I appreciate your call.
[01:32:18.401 --> 01:32:19.742]  Let me tell you what we know about this.
[01:32:21.303 --> 01:32:25.906]  When you look at a secret operation, by itself it's hard to penetrate it.
[01:32:27.242 --> 01:32:38.170]  Okay, but when you, over time, look at other similar operations, and then look at what's been declassified, and then you get the on-the-ground intelligence, you can find out exactly what happened.
[01:32:38.751 --> 01:32:50.220]  Now, from past operations, like Top-Off 1 and Top-Off 2, that happened shortly after 9-11, from Operation Dark Winter, that they had in early 2001, and these are all mainstream reports,
[01:32:56.297 --> 01:32:58.239]  You can find out exactly what's happening.
[01:32:58.319 --> 01:33:01.342]  Now, take the Denver operation and top off one.
[01:33:01.362 --> 01:33:04.305]  They've also had them in Seattle, Illinois, Chicago, everywhere.
[01:33:04.685 --> 01:33:07.108]  Seattle, Washington, Chicago, Illinois, Dallas, Texas.
[01:33:08.149 --> 01:33:13.674]  They will hire, like five, six bucks an hour, in some cases thousands of role players.
[01:33:14.435 --> 01:33:15.657]  They will blow up buses.
[01:33:15.677 --> 01:33:16.718]  They will burn cars.
[01:33:17.579 --> 01:33:19.100]  They will practice with riot police.
[01:33:19.140 --> 01:33:22.284]  They'll give the citizens signs saying, don't take my land.
[01:33:22.684 --> 01:33:25.087]  And then they practice rounding you up and putting you in the camp.
[01:33:25.688 --> 01:33:27.970]  Or they practice with people who wait at their homes.
[01:33:28.956 --> 01:33:29.997]  And they've done this in Austin.
[01:33:30.497 --> 01:33:39.445]  And the police drive around in city buses practicing going to the house and raiding the homes, or knocking on the home, depending on the list, and taking you to the facility.
[01:33:39.485 --> 01:33:40.306]  It's a mass arrest.
[01:33:40.326 --> 01:33:45.890]  Just like you hear about in Burma, or you hear about in Pakistan, or you hear about in Russia.
[01:33:46.451 --> 01:33:47.131]  That's what this is for.
[01:33:47.151 --> 01:33:48.332]  And they admit that's what it's for.
[01:33:48.352 --> 01:33:50.614]  It's in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[01:33:50.634 --> 01:33:57.140]  So what always happens with these stories is, people hear, I heard they were doing drills for arresting everybody with Cabela's in Illinois.
[01:33:58.974 --> 01:34:07.590]  About a week and two days ago, it was first reported by the Des Moines Register and others that they were taking over the cattle fairgrounds where they could process tens of thousands of people an hour.
[01:34:08.722 --> 01:34:18.429]  And we went on air, and Lee Rogers put out a report, it's on Infowars.com, he's from Rogue Government, and said, watch, this is going to be an illegal alien roundup.
[01:34:19.389 --> 01:34:22.231]  But they were saying it's part of a homeland security drill.
[01:34:22.311 --> 01:34:37.162]  Well, the government documents, RECS 84, now public, said they would use arresting illegals in the first wave, but only a few thousand here and there, there's 30 million, to make the public think it was for them, but really it's for political dissidents.
[01:34:37.862 --> 01:34:39.743]  Okay, they're very, very slick.
[01:34:40.904 --> 01:34:42.405]  And so none of this is hidden.
[01:34:43.665 --> 01:34:47.208]  It's just that those who are involved in it are told to shut up.
[01:34:47.248 --> 01:34:48.468]  Now, why are they really doing it?
[01:34:49.029 --> 01:34:53.591]  Why are they having drills with role players in Chicago?
[01:34:53.631 --> 01:34:55.092]  And I actually saw a blurb about that.
[01:34:55.132 --> 01:34:56.173]  It's happening all over the country.
[01:34:57.133 --> 01:35:04.819]  They're having a drill throughout the month, from the 1st to the 8th, they have another overlapping from the 6th to the 14th, and they have another one later in the month.
[01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:13.206]  And there's all these drills, the feds pipe-bomb themselves as part of the drill, there's no doubt, those always happen during the drills, and then later it's come out that it was part of drills.
[01:35:13.566 --> 01:35:15.408]  But then that's also, it's a huge psyop.
[01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:20.762]  And this is so they can test control of local police.
[01:35:21.203 --> 01:35:22.944]  They can test command and control.
[01:35:23.384 --> 01:35:31.049]  They can prepare the troops and police and feds, the people screaming, I'm an American, no, no, please not the camp, that that's okay.
[01:35:32.129 --> 01:35:37.753]  So this is to acclimate the media, the population, the police, the military, everybody.
[01:35:37.793 --> 01:35:39.794]  Robert Galen Ross comments on what she was just saying.
[01:35:41.875 --> 01:35:43.995]  You used the right term, PsyOps.
[01:35:44.716 --> 01:35:53.399]  It's a smoke screen to cover up what they're doing and to point you in the direction they want you to go or to stop you from doing what you'd like to do.
[01:35:53.959 --> 01:35:55.880]  And this is all very carefully controlled.
[01:35:56.320 --> 01:36:01.682]  Well, you notice, decades ago, we knew they'd built camps, it'd come out, people would say it was a conspiracy.
[01:36:01.722 --> 01:36:08.725]  Now, on the news, they admit, yeah, they've built camps for the citizens, and John Warner Defense Authorization Act says, in case the American people engage in insurrection.
[01:36:09.145 --> 01:36:14.907]  Why would they need to fund tens of billions of dollars and say the President's above the governors, and that governors can't be trusted?
[01:36:15.327 --> 01:36:18.629]  I mean, they're planning some really bad stuff that they think governors are going to revolt.
[01:36:18.889 --> 01:36:19.869]  What do you think that is, Robert?
[01:36:20.930 --> 01:36:24.071]  Well, there are some governors that are revolting.
[01:36:25.052 --> 01:36:29.416]  And the President says, I'm going to have... I mean, again, it could be Barack Obama for all we know.
[01:36:29.837 --> 01:36:41.728]  Yeah, some of the governors are saying, we're fed up with the federal government not enforcing immigration, so they're taking over, and that is a real threat to them.
[01:36:42.269 --> 01:36:48.695]  And a lot of governors, what is it, like 14 of them now or something, are saying no to the REAL ID Act, national ID cards.
[01:36:48.735 --> 01:36:49.055]  That's right.
[01:36:49.075 --> 01:36:49.755]  That's part of it.
[01:36:50.115 --> 01:36:53.456]  They're saying, we don't have to lay down and take this anymore.
[01:36:54.457 --> 01:36:59.258]  If we're going to defend our constituents, we need to really try to defend them and do something about it.
[01:36:59.938 --> 01:37:00.959]  And some of them are doing that.
[01:37:01.299 --> 01:37:04.360]  By the way, for cops driving along in your cars, don't just believe me.
[01:37:04.740 --> 01:37:06.260]  Go to PDD 51.
[01:37:06.300 --> 01:37:08.481]  Go to John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[01:37:08.521 --> 01:37:09.161]  Don't be lazy.
[01:37:09.581 --> 01:37:09.761]  PDD 51.
[01:37:09.801 --> 01:37:10.562]  Write it down.
[01:37:11.622 --> 01:37:12.583]  P.D.D.
[01:37:12.943 --> 01:37:14.283]  Presidential Decision Directive 51.
[01:37:14.463 --> 01:37:17.825]  There's an accompanying executive order, but just P.D.D.
[01:37:17.845 --> 01:37:17.825]  51.
[01:37:18.345 --> 01:37:21.687]  And then also John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[01:37:22.187 --> 01:37:28.510]  I mean, instead of just laughing and saying, I'm making this up, even though you're being trained for this, but you have double think, go read it.
[01:37:28.590 --> 01:37:29.711]  It says the states
[01:37:30.131 --> 01:37:30.631]  No longer.
[01:37:30.732 --> 01:37:31.972]  Congress has no authority.
[01:37:32.053 --> 01:37:34.935]  It says the President is a dictator in the first page.
[01:37:35.795 --> 01:37:37.096]  That's also in PD 51.
[01:37:37.416 --> 01:37:42.840]  And then Congress is told, the highest level security clearance, co-equal with the President, they're told they can't see it.
[01:37:43.161 --> 01:37:48.605]  How bad is it that even their lapdog Republican members of Homeland Security can't see it?
[01:37:49.185 --> 01:37:52.127]  Well, there's another thing that they don't talk about very much.
[01:37:53.849 --> 01:37:56.370]  The President has two very strong powers.
[01:37:56.490 --> 01:37:58.332]  One of them is a signing statement.
[01:37:59.469 --> 01:38:01.250]  And the other is the executive order.
[01:38:01.450 --> 01:38:11.614]  And Congress can pass a law, and when it reaches his desk, he can sign it and then immediately have a signing statement that says, ignore this law, we're not going to do it.
[01:38:12.114 --> 01:38:15.336]  And by the way, that's totally illegal, total fraud, total tyranny.
[01:38:15.616 --> 01:38:22.379]  The executive in the last decade has claimed that signing statement power and claimed it a new legislative power.
[01:38:23.099 --> 01:38:29.604]  In fact, he even has signing statements, Clinton started it, Bush is now doing it all the time, where he'll even announce a new paragraph.
[01:38:30.364 --> 01:38:32.285]  So it's just godlike.
[01:38:32.326 --> 01:38:33.907]  That's not America, folks.
[01:38:34.927 --> 01:38:35.408]  Go ahead.
[01:38:35.468 --> 01:38:37.229]  And Congress does zero about it.
[01:38:38.009 --> 01:38:42.773]  Congress has the power to stop this, but they just lay back and just let it happen.
[01:38:42.893 --> 01:38:43.953]  Well, I want to admit something.
[01:38:45.114 --> 01:38:47.016]  You can't help but become acclimated to this.
[01:38:47.477 --> 01:38:57.807]  As it gets crazier and crazier, as it gets weirder and weirder, as they taser you for no reason, as they show you video of stomping on innocent, now admitted they were innocent, people's heads who didn't resist.
[01:38:57.867 --> 01:38:58.988]  They said it was for their safety.
[01:38:59.269 --> 01:39:01.030]  Cops running up on guys they say are armed.
[01:39:01.311 --> 01:39:03.293]  That's even bad for the cops.
[01:39:04.754 --> 01:39:05.614]  I get acclimated.
[01:39:05.634 --> 01:39:07.195]  You know, as corporations in the U.S.
[01:39:07.215 --> 01:39:09.115]  say their employees have to have chips under the skin.
[01:39:10.115 --> 01:39:15.857]  I mean, it's getting so crazy that feds accuse student of terror and espionage for talking about Constitution.
[01:39:16.317 --> 01:39:19.458]  And I have the video and audio in their own documents where they teach the police this.
[01:39:19.838 --> 01:39:22.258]  And this guy was teaching, he worked for the administration.
[01:39:22.899 --> 01:39:24.059]  He's a doctorate student there.
[01:39:24.079 --> 01:39:25.479]  He's already a pastor.
[01:39:25.639 --> 01:39:30.080]  And at the big Bible school, it's Baptist Bible school.
[01:39:30.180 --> 01:39:31.601]  It's the one in Mount Vernon.
[01:39:33.182 --> 01:39:37.827]  And the Homeland Security called him in and said, you'll be arrested for espionage if you ever teach the Constitution again.
[01:39:38.808 --> 01:39:44.093]  And I know, I laugh too, but I've got FEMA on video telling police that.
[01:39:44.153 --> 01:39:48.919]  I've got them pulling a woman over and arresting her for a pocket Constitution in the same article.
[01:39:49.619 --> 01:39:53.804]  I mean, how do these police think it's terrorism to talk about the Constitution?
[01:39:54.949 --> 01:39:57.371]  Yeah, but their brainwashed themselves.
[01:39:58.512 --> 01:40:06.359]  They're trying to earn a living, and the only way they can earn a living is do what they're told to do, and it's sort of their nature to do this.
[01:40:07.399 --> 01:40:10.822]  And they said, alright, I'm just following orders.
[01:40:12.163 --> 01:40:19.890]  But they're doing things that if they were not on the police force, or not in the FBI, they wouldn't put up with it.
[01:40:20.595 --> 01:40:22.777]  Well, I mean, I want to ask FBI agents something.
[01:40:23.117 --> 01:40:24.478]  I've got you on video.
[01:40:24.598 --> 01:40:25.919]  I mean, I've got FEMA on video.
[01:40:25.959 --> 01:40:27.901]  This isn't just a person telling us this.
[01:40:28.522 --> 01:40:34.306]  I mean, how do you swear an oath to it, but then if somebody has a pocket constitution, you arrest them?
[01:40:35.107 --> 01:40:36.928]  I mean, what is their major problem?
[01:40:36.969 --> 01:40:39.391]  That's what the red, white, and blue symbolize.
[01:40:40.352 --> 01:40:43.196]  And you ought to have a conscience.
[01:40:43.476 --> 01:40:51.128]  If you're told to do something that is basically against your normal way of doing things, or your normal way of thinking,
[01:40:51.937 --> 01:40:54.037]  You need to say, well now, do I really want to do that?
[01:40:54.318 --> 01:40:58.598]  And you need to say, can I not do that?
[01:40:58.959 --> 01:41:01.039]  Of course, you'd love to get fired when you'd say that.
[01:41:01.839 --> 01:41:08.260]  But you need to start using your own conscience in these positions of power.
[01:41:08.481 --> 01:41:08.961]  Absolutely.
[01:41:08.981 --> 01:41:09.981]  Let's take another call here.
[01:41:10.401 --> 01:41:11.461]  Fred in Philadelphia.
[01:41:11.501 --> 01:41:12.441]  You're on the air, Fred.
[01:41:12.461 --> 01:41:14.082]  OK.
[01:41:14.162 --> 01:41:18.463]  First, I want to get some information, and then I want to share some information.
[01:41:18.483 --> 01:41:19.863]  Alex, just briefly,
[01:41:20.655 --> 01:41:29.187]  Tell me about this Library of Congress Steering Committee sent over by the Bilderberg Group to the Library of Congress.
[01:41:31.089 --> 01:41:34.811]  Well, that's a separate issue from... I don't think you understand what I was saying.
[01:41:35.392 --> 01:41:42.456]  We've got a guest coming up talking about, you know, did they really meet in Greece?
[01:41:42.576 --> 01:41:43.437]  I don't believe they did.
[01:41:43.497 --> 01:41:44.538]  Robert doesn't believe they did.
[01:41:44.558 --> 01:41:45.418]  He told me that privately.
[01:41:45.438 --> 01:41:47.060]  We'll get his take on that in a minute.
[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:58.527]  I'm saying this could be a steering committee because they have had steering committees that have met in France, met in Virginia, in the U.S., that have been in the news.
[01:41:59.428 --> 01:42:03.171]  By the way, I have actual minutes of steering committee meetings and Bilderberg meetings
[01:42:17.945 --> 01:42:19.307]  Okay, I'm going to share...
[01:42:36.373 --> 01:42:37.794]  We'll stay there.
[01:42:37.854 --> 01:42:38.174]  You know what?
[01:42:38.194 --> 01:42:39.955]  We're just going to go ahead and go during this break.
[01:42:40.495 --> 01:42:43.557]  So for listeners that are listening on the AM and FM, we'll be right back in three minutes.
[01:42:43.577 --> 01:42:44.418]  Appreciate all of you.
[01:42:44.758 --> 01:42:55.484]  For listeners that are listening to the InfoWars.com streams, not the GCN streams, the InfoWars.com streams, we're going to continue talking right now during this break with this caller so we have time to jam everybody in.
[01:42:55.784 --> 01:42:59.045]  We'll also tell you how to get Robert Galen Ross' books and how to visit his website.
[01:42:59.166 --> 01:42:59.766]  We'll be right back.
[01:43:01.334 --> 01:43:06.337]  Okay, Fred and Philly, go ahead and finish your point.
[01:43:06.577 --> 01:43:06.958]  Okay.
[01:43:08.759 --> 01:43:17.965]  The Library of Congress, just in April, eliminated its bibliographic and reference service.
[01:43:19.366 --> 01:43:22.708]  They will not deal with the public now.
[01:43:22.768 --> 01:43:26.670]  That's been around, I don't know how long, 200 years since they set it up, it's a big deal.
[01:43:29.758 --> 01:43:37.010]  Uh, I verify, first you call up, you get a recording, when you call the number for that, they say that's been eliminated.
[01:43:37.030 --> 01:43:40.957]  I spoke to people, and with a lot of evasion, they do.
[01:43:43.991 --> 01:43:50.794]  No, they're shutting down information.
[01:43:51.134 --> 01:43:54.315]  They are retroactively classifying most presidential papers.
[01:43:55.135 --> 01:43:58.797]  They're declaring national security when they dump toxic waste in your neighborhood now.
[01:43:59.177 --> 01:44:01.798]  This is a license for mass insane raping.
[01:44:02.058 --> 01:44:03.399]  The roads are falling apart.
[01:44:03.739 --> 01:44:06.000]  Hordes of police are running around foaming at the mouth.
[01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:08.101]  It's a total implosion of society.
[01:44:08.761 --> 01:44:09.881]  Robert, any comments?
[01:44:10.782 --> 01:44:11.202]  No, go ahead.
[01:44:11.997 --> 01:44:29.770]  And I also want to mention, Alex, that I've mentioned this before, but you had misunderstood what I said, that after they're going to digital television, there is a move to get rid of what's called audio services, and that is ordinary analog radio.
[01:44:30.331 --> 01:44:34.754]  When I say digital broadcasting is coming in, I don't mean
[01:44:37.558 --> 01:44:42.391]  I mean, it's the basic, since 1900 technology of a modulated wave.
[01:44:43.212 --> 01:44:47.436]  You're not going to be able to use ordinary radios if that plan goes through.
[01:44:47.876 --> 01:44:49.257]  And they don't call it radio.
[01:44:49.317 --> 01:44:51.939]  They call it audio services.
[01:44:52.440 --> 01:45:07.492]  No, I know there are moves to try to phase out the AM and FM dial and then have different receivers in your car, but they plan to transmit over the normal modulation just a signal that is then decoded somehow.
[01:45:07.532 --> 01:45:10.375]  I don't know how all the high-def radio and TV works.
[01:45:10.595 --> 01:45:18.123]  But I'm against that because that is going to add cost, complexity, you're going to cut down the number of sources of information.
[01:45:18.143 --> 01:45:22.928]  No, it's going to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to upgrade each station and I agree with you and I appreciate your call.
[01:45:22.948 --> 01:45:25.190]  So I don't think we disagreed there either.
[01:45:25.250 --> 01:45:26.772]  The problem is it's a time constraint.
[01:45:29.073 --> 01:45:54.078]  Yeah, they are using the forced move over to digital television and digital radio as a way to put added cost on people, and now they're trying to make radio stations, they're saying, in the next few years, just like TV has to switch over this year, they're trying to make the radio switch over in the next couple years, and that will bankrupt a lot of mom-and-pop stations.
[01:45:54.978 --> 01:45:55.898]  So that is a problem.
[01:45:56.239 --> 01:46:00.741]  Okay, we will go live back to the main transmission now.
[01:46:01.401 --> 01:46:16.287]  Robert... There are people that make it their business to run your life.
[01:46:16.307 --> 01:46:19.729]  There are people that make it their business to micromanage our world.
[01:46:22.227 --> 01:46:23.227]  That's why they're in control.
[01:46:23.687 --> 01:46:24.407]  They want power.
[01:46:24.467 --> 01:46:25.388]  That's why they're there.
[01:46:25.608 --> 01:46:31.369]  It takes good men and women who don't want power to stand up and fight back or be slaves.
[01:46:32.249 --> 01:46:35.850]  You didn't want power, folks, but you've got to get power to just live your life.
[01:46:37.010 --> 01:46:38.050]  Robert Galen Ross is our guest.
[01:46:38.070 --> 01:46:40.151]  He's going to stay over five minutes with us in the next hour.
[01:46:40.451 --> 01:46:46.652]  Then we've got Tony Gosling from billaburg.org coming on real fast to kind of flesh out this report they may have already met, but that
[01:46:49.331 --> 01:46:54.094]  According to this Athens paper, we'll see what's going on there with Tony Gosselin coming up.
[01:46:54.935 --> 01:47:06.963]  But before we go back to Ronnie and James in the next segment, Robert Gale and Ross, I wanted to get into the elite's power structure, who they are, and if they have their way, what this world will look like.
[01:47:07.023 --> 01:47:07.703]  You've got the floor.
[01:47:08.244 --> 01:47:17.070]  Okay, the person at the very top of the organization behind the curtain is a fellow named David de Rothschild.
[01:47:18.230 --> 01:47:24.732]  And David Rockefeller is his agent here in the United States.
[01:47:24.832 --> 01:47:36.496]  Those two are behind all of this power structure, and their goal is to create the New World Order, the Global Union, and they'll probably change those terms.
[01:47:39.966 --> 01:47:54.778]  They were trying to create the American Union, and Cesar Chavez stopped them, so now they're creating the North American Union, and now they're even changing the term for North American Union to a less mundane term.
[01:47:55.538 --> 01:48:06.927]  And it's something to do with standards and procedures or something like that, but they're trying to... the people have honed in on North American Union, and so they've got to get their attention off of that.
[01:48:07.808 --> 01:48:21.585]  I mean, they just said, John McCain just said, Gary Hart just said, the CFR, all said in unison in the last two months, we're not going to call it New World Order anymore, we're going to call it global freedom, global democracy, a league of global democracies.
[01:48:21.605 --> 01:48:25.610]  But when you actually read what they're doing, it's taking our right to vote and our liberty away.
[01:48:26.551 --> 01:48:29.832]  But you're right, they're now trying to change terms because they're worried.
[01:48:30.113 --> 01:48:30.593]  That's right.
[01:48:30.833 --> 01:48:40.657]  And when the people really get focused in on something and they say, well I really need to check on that, well then they step in and change the terms so you can't check it anymore.
[01:48:40.677 --> 01:48:43.638]  Well like DynCorp got caught running giant child kidnapping rinks.
[01:48:43.658 --> 01:48:45.599]  I mean it was in the news and they just changed their name.
[01:48:45.979 --> 01:48:46.179]  Yeah.
[01:48:47.780 --> 01:48:49.700]  So they're in power.
[01:48:51.704 --> 01:49:01.456]  But there are only about three or four thousand of them, and there's something like six billion of us, and so we shouldn't put up with that.
[01:49:02.177 --> 01:49:07.263]  We've got to start legally fighting this.
[01:49:08.416 --> 01:49:15.359]  Well, if it gets down to the last ditch, we may have to do even more than just verbal and legal tactics.
[01:49:15.580 --> 01:49:17.621]  Well, that's why they're militarizing the police.
[01:49:17.761 --> 01:49:21.202]  And again, the police are literally destroying themselves.
[01:49:21.222 --> 01:49:24.364]  I mean, do you want to talk to the cops out there that don't understand what's happening?
[01:49:25.393 --> 01:49:27.255]  Yeah, I really haven't talked to any of them about it.
[01:49:27.275 --> 01:49:29.136]  I mean, you're talking to them right now.
[01:49:29.156 --> 01:49:29.937]  What do you want to say to them?
[01:49:30.077 --> 01:49:34.220]  Okay, well, use your own conscience in what you're doing.
[01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:38.844]  If what you're told to do, if you think it's wrong, think about it.
[01:49:40.565 --> 01:49:47.751]  Because you've got to be concerned about your family, your children, and how what they've told you to do is going to affect them.
[01:49:48.092 --> 01:49:53.176]  And I think there's a good chance now the New World Order is going to lose, and they need to think about being prosecuted later.
[01:49:53.556 --> 01:49:54.136]  That's right.
[01:49:54.216 --> 01:50:18.604]  In fact, they've tried to, and maybe they've already done it, write into laws the provisions to exempt them from prosecution later as war criminals, and they're trying to make that retroactive to 1995 or something like that, to relieve them from being called war criminals later.
[01:50:19.491 --> 01:50:24.275]  Well, that's what the whole NSA thing was, is let's pass a law so what we did isn't criminal.
[01:50:25.516 --> 01:50:26.637]  It's the same thing on torture.
[01:50:26.737 --> 01:50:29.719]  Let us pass a law that torture's okay, because we tortured a bunch of people.
[01:50:30.399 --> 01:50:33.422]  Robert Galen Ross, final segment with you, my friend, on the other side.

[01:51:04.420 --> 01:51:08.244]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[01:51:08.584 --> 01:51:15.107]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:51:15.447 --> 01:51:18.648]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[01:51:18.868 --> 01:51:26.372]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[01:51:45.021 --> 01:51:50.384]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[01:51:53.566 --> 01:51:55.487]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:51:55.947 --> 01:51:58.709]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:52:17.080 --> 01:52:18.761]  Final segment with Robert Galen Ross.
[01:52:18.781 --> 01:52:26.285]  Before we get a quick comment from Ronnie and James finishing up, if they succeed, what will the world look like if the Globalists win?
[01:52:26.705 --> 01:52:28.286]  What is their dream world?
[01:52:28.746 --> 01:52:29.967]  And what's the time frame on that?
[01:52:30.925 --> 01:52:57.783]  Well, it's really going to go back to the days of the Knights of the Round Table where the Kings, when they would go to their neighboring castle to visit a friend, they had to have a big army around them because they had made their people within their region paupers, and we're going to end up very close to that ourselves.
[01:53:00.285 --> 01:53:15.239]  People are going to be without things, and they're going to be desperate, they're going to have to resort to crime, and eventually there won't be enough jails to hold them all, and so it's really going to be tough.
[01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:19.964]  And if we get past the end of 2009 and start recovering,
[01:53:22.731 --> 01:53:30.356]  Then it'll be a short period, but if we don't get past 2009, it's going to slide into a depression.
[01:53:32.277 --> 01:53:36.539]  Meanwhile, the globalists are showing every indication of trying to move their enslavement ahead.
[01:53:36.559 --> 01:53:38.400]  I mean, they're just going pell-mell wild.
[01:53:38.700 --> 01:53:39.121]  That's right.
[01:53:39.541 --> 01:53:42.463]  Alright, Ronnie in California, you're on the air with Robert Gellin Ross, go ahead.
[01:53:43.863 --> 01:53:44.424]  My brother.
[01:53:44.904 --> 01:53:45.164]  Hello.
[01:53:45.484 --> 01:53:46.945]  Alex Jones, my brother from another mother.
[01:53:47.406 --> 01:53:47.826]  How you doing?
[01:53:48.621 --> 01:53:50.142]  Good.
[01:53:50.242 --> 01:53:51.683]  I wanted to make two points.
[01:53:51.743 --> 01:53:54.125]  Two days ago, one was about the D.C.
[01:53:54.165 --> 01:53:57.066]  Madam lady, and another one was about the vaccinations.
[01:53:57.267 --> 01:54:03.691]  Two nights ago, I was watching CNN, and they had said that people are crying foul play and conspiracy about the D.C.
[01:54:03.751 --> 01:54:03.951]  Madam.
[01:54:03.971 --> 01:54:04.771]  Yeah, they attacked me.
[01:54:04.791 --> 01:54:05.892]  I haven't played that yet.
[01:54:05.932 --> 01:54:07.473]  I don't know if you're aware of that.
[01:54:07.513 --> 01:54:15.278]  They had broadcasted PrisonPlanet.com on CNN and InfoWars, and they actually played your interview with her.
[01:54:15.498 --> 01:54:21.301]  Yeah, I mean, it's kind of like I'm, in a way, I really don't like talking about when we're getting covered, but they did murder her.
[01:54:21.622 --> 01:54:22.942]  So, you know, I'm going to play that today.
[01:54:22.982 --> 01:54:27.045]  I keep meaning to, after Tony Gosling's on with this, I'll play that audio and analyze the lies.
[01:54:29.126 --> 01:54:30.287]  Today, I was watching the CNN.
[01:54:30.307 --> 01:54:33.750]  Today, I always, you know, pay attention to how they're lying to everybody.
[01:54:34.190 --> 01:54:45.298]  But they said that they found out that there actually is thermosol in the vaccinations, and they actually admitted to it today on CNN, and saying that now they're going to take it out of the vaccinations.
[01:54:46.378 --> 01:54:47.279]  I know, I know.
[01:54:47.299 --> 01:54:48.580]  I know exactly what you're saying.
[01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:51.862]  I mean, there's probably a thousand more chemicals in there that they're not even talking about.
[01:54:51.882 --> 01:54:53.323]  I mean, Robert, why are you laughing?
[01:54:53.383 --> 01:54:54.084]  It's just so crazy.
[01:54:54.104 --> 01:54:54.844]  Well, I don't know.
[01:54:54.925 --> 01:54:55.925]  It's so sickening.
[01:54:57.146 --> 01:54:57.566]  It is.
[01:54:57.666 --> 01:54:58.247]  It's sickening.
[01:54:59.395 --> 01:55:02.296]  They're doing major damage to our children.
[01:55:02.316 --> 01:55:11.180]  Autism and Alzheimer's disease, a lot of those things are caused by things that they put in these injections.
[01:55:11.220 --> 01:55:12.121]  But they're always lying.
[01:55:12.141 --> 01:55:14.342]  They're saying, five years ago, we never put it in there.
[01:55:14.362 --> 01:55:15.242]  Then we took it all out.
[01:55:15.282 --> 01:55:16.403]  Now we put it back in.
[01:55:16.583 --> 01:55:17.683]  It's not bad for you.
[01:55:18.164 --> 01:55:20.745]  Have you ever heard that newscast where they said it's good for you, Mercury?
[01:55:24.167 --> 01:55:24.988]  It's crazy!
[01:55:25.028 --> 01:55:26.209]  These people are crazy!
[01:55:27.049 --> 01:55:27.530]  I'm sorry.
[01:55:27.550 --> 01:55:28.470]  Anything else, Ronnie?
[01:55:29.051 --> 01:55:29.491]  One more thing.
[01:55:29.511 --> 01:55:36.516]  I just last week went to the copycat over here and copied about a thousand papers.
[01:55:37.016 --> 01:55:45.582]  One has about eight websites to look at, and I did radio stations to listen to with George Norrie, and also in the back I put Google Videos to search.
[01:55:46.062 --> 01:55:53.165]  From 9-11, Road to Tyranny, to Jordan Maxwell, and to Naked Truth, to different documentaries that people can do.
[01:55:53.586 --> 01:55:54.266]  Anyone can do this.
[01:55:54.426 --> 01:55:55.126]  Anyone can do that.
[01:55:55.266 --> 01:55:58.848]  I mean, I paid $50, $60, $100, whatever.
[01:55:58.908 --> 01:56:06.271]  I'm on a fixed income, and I'm being able to do this, and I'm fighting the New World Order, and I'm doing the Info Wars, and I've been doing this for about 10 years now.
[01:56:06.451 --> 01:56:08.232]  Hang in there and don't stop.
[01:56:08.472 --> 01:56:09.653]  I want to see other people do this.
[01:56:09.693 --> 01:56:11.574]  I mean, anyone can do this.
[01:56:12.435 --> 01:56:13.356]  Great, great job.
[01:56:13.376 --> 01:56:14.637]  Dust tape and paper.
[01:56:15.018 --> 01:56:21.806]  And I'm going to go tape it all over the polls, schools, parks, recreation centers, and that's what we've got to do.
[01:56:22.146 --> 01:56:22.667]  Absolutely.
[01:56:22.707 --> 01:56:24.028]  Thank you so much for the call, Ronnie.
[01:56:24.369 --> 01:56:25.690]  James and others, your calls are coming up.
[01:56:25.710 --> 01:56:26.511]  We've got to let Robert go.
[01:56:26.551 --> 01:56:27.433]  He's got some appointments.
[01:56:27.933 --> 01:56:29.956]  Robert Galen Ross, fire out the website.
[01:56:31.877 --> 01:56:37.139]  My website is www.4rie.com.
[01:56:37.519 --> 01:56:39.760]  That's 4rie.com.
[01:56:40.380 --> 01:56:42.661]  You know, we laugh because it is sick.
[01:56:42.861 --> 01:56:44.621]  It's really sick.
[01:56:44.881 --> 01:56:49.643]  It's so ridiculous how bad these people are and the public can't see it, some of them.
[01:56:49.683 --> 01:56:51.723]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[01:56:52.003 --> 01:56:53.724]  Hey, I really appreciate you coming in.
[01:56:53.744 --> 01:56:59.766]  I hope folks get your book, The Elite Serial Killers of Lincoln, JFK, RFK, MLK, It's Amazing, and Infowars.com.
[01:57:00.146 --> 01:57:01.068]  My pleasure, Alex.
[01:57:01.348 --> 01:57:02.110]  Thank you, Robert.
[01:57:38.908 --> 01:57:41.389]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:57:41.469 --> 01:57:42.610]  Most people have no idea.
[01:57:42.630 --> 01:57:43.410]  They're not after money.
[01:57:43.430 --> 01:57:44.490]  They have all the money they need.
[01:57:44.710 --> 01:57:45.431]  They're after power.
[01:57:45.671 --> 01:57:46.371]  That's their after news.

[01:58:05.718 --> 01:58:08.920]  Martial Law is coming, but it's not going to arrive overnight.
[01:58:09.221 --> 01:58:11.042]  It's going to be incremental.
[01:58:11.202 --> 01:58:12.923]  This country is already teetering on the edge.
[01:58:13.183 --> 01:58:16.045]  Any incident, small or large, could trigger a total takeover.
[01:58:16.265 --> 01:58:17.485]  Anything could be the final push.

[02:00:28.826 --> 02:00:31.648]  Tony Gosling is our guest for this segment and the next.
[02:00:31.688 --> 02:00:40.874]  Then I'm going to cover a bunch of news we haven't gotten to and take a few final calls in the last 30 minutes of the four-hour weekday show we do every Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:00:40.975 --> 02:00:41.875]  until 3 p.m.
[02:00:41.895 --> 02:00:43.696]  We've now expanded it to a fourth hour.

[02:00:46.478 --> 02:00:47.479]  Central Standard Time.
[02:00:47.859 --> 02:00:56.705]  Don't forget I'll be showing my new film, Truth Rising, the story of the 9-11 Truth Movement, 9-11 Truth, We Are Change, Willie Nelson, Jesse Ventura,
[02:00:57.686 --> 02:01:22.836]  Martin Sheen, it just goes on and on, all the people on their side, just amazing who gets confronted, Alan Greenspan, David Rockefeller, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, John McCain, Barack Obama, John Edwards, Arnold Schwarzenegger, all of them, I mean it's just insane!
[02:01:24.053 --> 02:01:31.338]  And it's dynamic, well done, all of these confrontations, you know, on high quality video, not some YouTube clip, as most of you have seen it.
[02:01:32.159 --> 02:01:39.124]  And interwoven with the last three years of demonstrations and protests and the footage of Bill Maher being confronted.
[02:01:39.144 --> 02:01:40.124]  Amazing film.
[02:01:40.645 --> 02:01:41.625]  And that's coming up.
[02:01:41.685 --> 02:01:42.326]  Two showings.

[02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:17.802]  It's the Alamo Ritz, their new big one downtown on 6th Street.
[02:02:17.902 --> 02:02:19.183]  Hope to see you there.
[02:02:19.843 --> 02:02:22.904]  Okay, let's go to Tony Gosling up on
[02:02:24.185 --> 02:02:27.206]  PrisonPlanet.com, we have a link to the Infowars.net story.
[02:02:27.526 --> 02:02:30.086]  Complete media lockdown on Athens' Bilderberg meeting?
[02:02:30.566 --> 02:02:33.967]  Did recent exposures prompt elite confab into super secrecy?
[02:02:34.667 --> 02:02:36.227]  Or is the Greek newspaper wrong?
[02:02:37.127 --> 02:02:38.748]  Could this just be a steering committee?
[02:02:38.768 --> 02:02:39.848]  Are they partially right?
[02:02:40.128 --> 02:02:41.488]  We know they do have steering committees.
[02:02:42.088 --> 02:02:45.089]  This is the journalist, the man who runs Bilderberg.org.
[02:02:45.469 --> 02:02:51.250]  He first broke this in the Western English language press that this could be happening.
[02:02:51.610 --> 02:02:53.693]  And it's important because they have tried a lot of tricks.
[02:02:53.753 --> 02:02:57.658]  It's been decades since we didn't find out where they were meeting and indeed get there.
[02:02:57.958 --> 02:02:58.679]  They normally meet...
[02:02:59.671 --> 02:03:04.793]  In late May into early June, but joining us is Tony Gosling from the United Kingdom.
[02:03:05.134 --> 02:03:06.134]  Tony, thanks for coming on.
[02:03:06.754 --> 02:03:08.115]  Hi Alex, yeah.
[02:03:08.535 --> 02:03:16.779]  The interesting thing is, though, that I don't think we've had anything whatsoever in the English language about this before the event this year, and there's still very, very little.
[02:03:16.859 --> 02:03:23.642]  I mean, the fact that there was no opportunity for any journalist to actually get there this year means that they're saying very little.
[02:03:24.062 --> 02:03:33.787]  I mean, I've had a look at this, obviously, I don't speak Greek, I've had a look at this and put it through the various translation devices and things, and it certainly looks as if this is the meeting.
[02:03:33.827 --> 02:03:45.392]  The reason I say that is because, you know, on the forum, which is kind of off the side of the Bilderberg.org site, there's been a lot of discussion over the past few weeks and months about where this meeting is going to take place.
[02:03:46.081 --> 02:03:46.401]  I think so.
[02:04:01.651 --> 02:04:02.952]  Let's be clear then, you're saying...
[02:04:17.677 --> 02:04:31.187]  And I think you're a credible source and very accurate in the past, for listeners out there wondering my opinion for what it's worth, that I put a lot of stake in what you believe, Tony, because you're one of the most tireless researchers on this front and have done so much work.
[02:04:31.827 --> 02:04:34.769]  You're saying, tentatively, or 80% chance, 70, 60?
[02:04:34.849 --> 02:04:39.513]  I'd say it's almost certain that this was the meeting of the past weekend.
[02:04:39.533 --> 02:04:41.014]  The most significant thing about it
[02:04:41.753 --> 02:04:52.699]  Is that this is the first time, certainly since I've been doing this, and that's probably for 12 years or so, that we haven't actually managed to figure out where they're meeting for certain beforehand.
[02:04:52.719 --> 02:05:02.484]  Now, we had some pretty good indications that it was going to be in Greece, and at this particular hotel, in a place beginning with V that I wouldn't even like to try and pronounce.
[02:05:02.504 --> 02:05:04.144]  We'll spell it out for people!
[02:05:05.665 --> 02:05:09.087]  V-O-U-L-I-A-G-M-E-N-I.
[02:05:09.147 --> 02:05:11.008]  Voliamini, maybe.
[02:05:11.828 --> 02:05:13.010]  Well, this is score one!
[02:05:31.127 --> 02:05:35.068]  Okay, so that's why you think this is so credible and you're saying virtually certain, 95% chance.
[02:05:35.228 --> 02:05:46.272]  Yeah, I mean for the last three or four weeks on the Bilderberg Forum, we've been saying it certainly looks like one of the first two weekends in Greece in May.
[02:05:46.932 --> 02:05:49.473]  Now this is historically very early for them to be meeting.
[02:05:50.399 --> 02:05:52.200]  No, it's around about the normal time.
[02:05:52.240 --> 02:05:54.762]  I mean, it's during May and June.
[02:05:55.542 --> 02:05:58.224]  There's nothing particularly strange about the timing.
[02:05:58.264 --> 02:05:59.104]  I was looking at some dates.
[02:05:59.124 --> 02:06:01.506]  Don't they generally meet in late May, early June?
[02:06:02.646 --> 02:06:05.108]  Well, yes, but this week we're coming up for the middle of May.
[02:06:05.128 --> 02:06:06.949]  There are other meetings around about this time.
[02:06:07.209 --> 02:06:09.891]  I don't think that's particularly special about this year.
[02:06:10.111 --> 02:06:20.520]  Okay, but what you're saying is so credible is that you've got a lot of intel, a lot of your sources that you trust, we're pointing towards Athens, Greece, and now it appears that's happened.
[02:06:20.940 --> 02:06:31.229]  Well, the thing that really stands out this year, Alex, is the fact that we've had absolutely no information about the movements of some of the key Bilderberg people.
[02:06:31.269 --> 02:06:34.452]  What's happening is that they're taking that information off the web now.
[02:06:35.172 --> 02:06:35.653]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:06:48.650 --> 02:06:56.234]  In the past, had been pretty good at putting on the web whereabouts they were going, what their engagements were, you know, in the future.
[02:06:56.254 --> 02:06:58.175]  And then you could see where they were clustering.
[02:06:58.235 --> 02:06:59.496]  That's right, exactly.
[02:06:59.656 --> 02:07:04.799]  And this year that's been almost impossible to do, because that information has just not been there.
[02:07:05.139 --> 02:07:10.122]  I mean, there's been a little bit, so, you know, we've had a bit of a go at figuring out where they're going to be.
[02:07:10.142 --> 02:07:12.463]  So this is a score, a big one for Bilderberg Group.
[02:07:12.483 --> 02:07:13.364]  This is a big victory.
[02:07:13.744 --> 02:07:14.484]  This is, yeah.
[02:07:14.504 --> 02:07:23.708]  And also, I think, I mean, my own feeling is that it's a little bit ominous that they've decided that they need to really make sure that absolutely nobody in the English language covers them.
[02:07:24.048 --> 02:07:24.988]  And that's what's happened this year.
[02:07:25.008 --> 02:07:28.009]  There was not a single English language journalist there this year.
[02:07:28.049 --> 02:07:29.009]  Well, you just stole my thunder.
[02:07:29.029 --> 02:07:29.730]  Let me stop you.
[02:07:31.330 --> 02:07:41.996]  If you're correct, and I pray you're not, because this will be quite a victory for them, they hate being hounded by us the first time in 30 plus years that Tucker hasn't learned the location.
[02:07:42.136 --> 02:07:50.561]  If this is the case, and I'm being convinced by you, gosh I hope you're wrong, but that's my next point.
[02:07:51.241 --> 02:07:56.364]  Man, we've got FEMA camp round-up drills going on, bizarre military activities, all sorts of stuff.
[02:07:56.724 --> 02:07:58.285]  And I'm not trying to fear-monger, folks.
[02:07:58.705 --> 02:08:01.687]  I mean, other people jump at shadows, but I'm seeing a lot of weird stuff.
[02:08:01.947 --> 02:08:05.269]  I've been very disquieted in my gut, which I also always go off of.
[02:08:05.969 --> 02:08:11.192]  And if they don't pull something big, some new war, some new financial thing, they were certainly thinking about it.
[02:08:11.612 --> 02:08:19.857]  And the fact that they would go super-stealth like this would show and point towards something was happening here that they did not want to be known.
[02:08:20.037 --> 02:08:20.357]  Go ahead.
[02:08:20.797 --> 02:08:21.337]  That's right.
[02:08:21.657 --> 02:08:25.059]  And also, the venue this year is a really isolated place.
[02:08:25.119 --> 02:08:36.284]  I mean, if you or I were to get down there, Alex, we'd have found it very, very difficult to get close to them, to speak to anyone from the hotel, to ask the waiters, etc., to keep an eye on them.
[02:08:36.664 --> 02:08:57.669]  To inform the staff at the hotel about the Nazi roots of Bilderberg, you know, the Prince Bernhard setting it up in the first place, and it's actually one of the most important things I've found going to these Bilderberg meetings is to actually have a chat to the staff beforehand and when you actually explain to them the connections with fascism and the Nazis then often the staff are
[02:08:58.189 --> 02:09:00.250]  Shocked, and are actually quite cooperative.
[02:09:00.290 --> 02:09:07.274]  And in fact, you also find, as you probably found yourself, that some of the participants also find these meetings really smothering.
[02:09:07.774 --> 02:09:19.060]  I mean, we had a chat to a couple of politicians when I was at the meeting in Versailles a few years ago, who actually come out of the meeting to buy cigarettes just to have any excuse to get out of the place.
[02:09:19.640 --> 02:09:21.721]  These were the politicians, not the financiers.
[02:09:21.881 --> 02:09:29.245]  By smothering, describe from all the tidbits you've gotten over the years from your sources and even mainstream press reports, by smothering what you mean.
[02:09:29.265 --> 02:09:31.365]  Sorry?
[02:09:32.146 --> 02:09:34.287]  Describe by smothering what you mean.
[02:09:34.587 --> 02:09:40.130]  I mean, describe details of the definition of smothering.
[02:09:40.590 --> 02:09:47.473]  Well, I mean, what they do is they try and make sure that nobody gets any information about these conferences.
[02:09:48.013 --> 02:10:02.530]  I mean, they also have in the past put out disinformation, put out false lists with sort of weird Jewish names, loads of Jewish names on there so that the idea is to sort of associate that with people like you and I, Alex, to brand us as anti-Semites.
[02:10:08.053 --> 02:10:21.842]  That's right, they really want to make this an anti-semitic thing, and that's why they've been caught funding Nazi gribs and PR gribs, because that's so important that we now have a real political debate about this, they want to taint it with a you-know-what in the punch bowl.
[02:10:22.322 --> 02:10:39.228]  I mean, if you and I had the sort of financing that these people from the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the IMF had behind their PR operation and behind their intelligence operation, I mean, and their disinformation operation, then, you know, I think we would be laughing.
[02:10:39.288 --> 02:10:43.389]  But, I mean, they have a fantastic amount of resources to put into this.
[02:10:44.289 --> 02:10:48.912]  I mean, I think it's pretty clear to me that they're planning something pretty nasty coming up soon.
[02:10:48.952 --> 02:10:54.096]  That's why they've spent a lot of time and effort this year keeping everybody away from them.
[02:10:54.956 --> 02:11:04.923]  Also, of course, it's significant that they're down in Greece, because these people are big followers of Greek classical mythology and pre-Christian stuff.
[02:11:05.163 --> 02:11:05.643]  Eugenics.
[02:11:05.663 --> 02:11:10.906]  Their religion is eugenics and the worship of the Spartan eugenic system.
[02:11:11.307 --> 02:11:11.767]  That's right.
[02:11:11.867 --> 02:11:18.731]  So I think it is significant that they wanted to have a big meeting in Greece this year to make it kind of glitzy, but absolutely private.
[02:11:18.771 --> 02:11:25.575]  And it scares me, actually, that they're able to keep any scrutiny by any of the Western press out of there.
[02:11:25.935 --> 02:11:33.740]  And of course, our job in the past years, even if the press don't listen in the West, is just to at least flag it up to the press to make sure that a few of them do turn up.
[02:11:34.881 --> 02:11:37.483]  Tony Gosselin, Bilderberg.org, stay with us if you can.
[02:11:37.503 --> 02:11:43.747]  I want to come back and ask you a few other questions about what you think this big nasty thing could be.
[02:11:43.827 --> 02:11:56.556]  We know two years ago, plus, they said they were going to implode the economy, pop the subprime mortgage bubble, to start the unraveling so they could shear the slaves, the scum, the trash, the filth, the cattle, that's us.
[02:11:56.576 --> 02:11:59.639]  Do you think it's going to be that or is it attacking Iran?
[02:11:59.659 --> 02:12:00.379]  We'll be right back.
[02:12:01.320 --> 02:12:02.641]  It is a big idea.
[02:12:03.766 --> 02:12:04.827]  A New World Order!
[02:12:05.547 --> 02:12:09.789]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:12:10.450 --> 02:12:12.210]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[02:12:12.391 --> 02:12:15.532]  Won't their objective be world domination?
[02:12:16.053 --> 02:12:18.474]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:12:19.234 --> 02:12:26.558]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:12:29.582 --> 02:12:34.545]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:12:35.046 --> 02:12:38.488]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:12:38.888 --> 02:12:41.390]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:12:41.450 --> 02:12:42.611]  Most people have no idea.
[02:12:42.631 --> 02:12:43.391]  They're not after money.
[02:12:43.411 --> 02:12:44.472]  They have all the money they need.
[02:12:44.692 --> 02:12:45.393]  They're after power.
[02:12:45.673 --> 02:12:46.513]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[02:13:58.905 --> 02:14:01.866]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:14:02.147 --> 02:14:05.588]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:14:05.768 --> 02:14:07.568]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:14:08.209 --> 02:14:10.950]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:14:11.250 --> 02:14:12.210]  It is essential that patriots
[02:14:12.210 --> 02:14:12.590]  We're good to go.
[02:14:38.513 --> 02:14:38.733]  We're good.
[02:15:00.461 --> 02:15:03.965]  Hello, I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 15 books on health and natural healing.
[02:15:04.286 --> 02:15:08.010]  Vaccines included, medicines kill more people every year than any illness.
[02:15:08.410 --> 02:15:14.818]  The cost of drug side effects in America is more than $200 billion annually, with the worst toll taken by antibiotics.
[02:15:15.238 --> 02:15:18.122]  But there is a cure for this medical madness that has remained secret.
[02:15:18.502 --> 02:15:27.666]  OxySilver, developed by NASA scientists to keep astronauts healthy, is an evolutionary new dietary supplement making deadly vaccinations and antibiotics obsolete.
[02:15:27.907 --> 02:15:32.229]  Taking one to two teaspoons daily boosts natural immunity without drug toxicity.
[02:15:32.569 --> 02:15:35.390]  OxySilver combines oxygen and silver in a new way.
[02:15:35.670 --> 02:15:41.813]  The oxygen becomes a supercharged germ killer freeing your immune system to fight colds, flus, cancers, and more.
[02:15:42.133 --> 02:15:45.855]  Build disease defenses naturally, painlessly, powerfully, safely,
[02:15:46.115 --> 02:15:46.415]  I think?
[02:16:07.779 --> 02:16:12.162]  Tony Gosling, Bilderberg.org, been to many of the meetings and covering it for more than a decade.
[02:16:13.242 --> 02:16:14.863]  Joins us weeks ago.
[02:16:14.943 --> 02:16:21.648]  He was speculating a lot of evidence was coming in as he told you that it was going to be in Greece.
[02:16:23.652 --> 02:16:26.814]  And he believes that it happened last weekend and that they went in and met.
[02:16:27.554 --> 02:16:33.098]  Other than this report, do you know how credible this news source is?
[02:16:33.158 --> 02:16:34.078]  I mean, it looks credible.
[02:16:34.098 --> 02:16:35.619]  It looks like they've got a lot of people on staff.
[02:16:36.239 --> 02:16:38.721]  It's just so hard to try to read Greek.
[02:16:39.661 --> 02:16:41.843]  You really think that they've met and defeated us?
[02:16:42.722 --> 02:16:43.282]  I think so.
[02:16:43.703 --> 02:16:47.486]  This newspaper... I mean, there's just two things that make me think that.
[02:16:47.546 --> 02:16:49.968]  First of all is that it was pointed towards Greece anyway.
[02:16:49.988 --> 02:16:51.750]  It didn't look like it was going to be there.
[02:16:51.790 --> 02:16:58.316]  And then this is a national newspaper in Greece that, even though it's printed in Crete, apparently it's circulated right across Greece.
[02:16:58.436 --> 02:17:06.023]  And it's on the front page of the newspaper, a picture of this Bilderberg meeting, or a picture from afar, from a telephoto lens, of it happening.
[02:17:07.183 --> 02:17:11.686]  I don't think it's a steering group, but I mean, the thing is, this is part of their little game.
[02:17:12.506 --> 02:17:22.291]  But at the end of the day, looking at, comparing all these various sources, I think, you know, there's definitely been a big security clampdown this year, and it doesn't entirely surprise me.
[02:17:22.711 --> 02:17:24.132]  We haven't found out.
[02:17:24.372 --> 02:17:26.312]  Other people get depressed when their soccer team loses.
[02:17:26.372 --> 02:17:26.992]  I get depressed.
[02:17:27.133 --> 02:17:27.613]  Yeah, I know.
[02:17:27.633 --> 02:17:28.453]  Well, it is.
[02:17:28.493 --> 02:17:30.273]  You do feel like it's a bit of a body blow.
[02:17:30.573 --> 02:17:38.234]  But in a way, you know, there's only so much you can do at one of these extremely secluded, island-style venues.
[02:17:38.314 --> 02:17:48.376]  Anyway, you know, you can't necessarily get... But being across the water or circling in a boat, being harassed by police, then gets it in the news, and then we expose the shadow government.
[02:17:48.696 --> 02:17:50.457]  This is not good, if you're right.
[02:17:50.497 --> 02:17:51.697]  And Tony, I respect you, but...
[02:17:52.617 --> 02:17:53.577]  Let me just move forward here.
[02:17:53.857 --> 02:17:59.939]  What do you think, and then make whatever point you want, what do you think the big nasties are that they were planning?
[02:18:00.299 --> 02:18:12.121]  Well, it's really difficult to tell that, Alex, and you know, one doesn't want to get really too much into fear mongering, but it does seem to me that we are headed towards some sort of a clash possibly with the Chinese.
[02:18:12.161 --> 02:18:16.382]  There's loads of anti-Chinese stuff going on, and goodness knows what's going to happen.
[02:18:16.402 --> 02:18:20.343]  I mean, I've said in the little report that I've done about this year's Bilderberg,
[02:18:21.683 --> 02:18:22.483]  We're good to go.
[02:18:48.099 --> 02:18:48.360]  I think so.
[02:19:11.931 --> 02:19:16.253]  Horrified as to how obedient they were to the Chinese government.
[02:19:16.273 --> 02:19:22.796]  You know, you think to yourself, hopefully, that journalists will have at least a little interest and sympathy for ordinary people, but these people didn't at all.
[02:19:23.116 --> 02:19:28.599]  And they seemed, thought it was very, very strange that we should even question what the Chinese government wanted to say.
[02:19:28.619 --> 02:19:30.920]  So, you know, that's one aspect of all this.
[02:19:31.400 --> 02:19:37.604]  The other thing, of course, is that we've had two big false flag attacks in the U.S.
[02:19:37.624 --> 02:19:39.465]  since 9-11 and here in the U.K.
[02:19:39.945 --> 02:19:41.666]  on 7-7.
[02:19:41.766 --> 02:19:46.628]  One of the places that we haven't had that yet is Israel, so I wonder if something like that could happen over there.
[02:19:46.769 --> 02:19:52.552]  A lot of experts we talk to do think the next staged event is set for Israel.
[02:19:53.212 --> 02:19:53.892]  Well, we'll see.
[02:19:54.473 --> 02:20:12.920]  The other thing, of course, which is a massive possibility is a kind of, I don't know how to describe it really, but a sort of the Gulf of Tonkin for real, where you have, you know, British ships or US ships that are basically just exploded and then that is blamed on whoever it is that they want to kick off this war with.
[02:20:13.920 --> 02:20:27.209]  Thankfully, I think, it's fair to say in Britain here that our military is aware of the danger of these kinds of exercises and of also these kind of tricks that are used to get wars started.
[02:20:27.229 --> 02:20:30.652]  I'm not quite so sure that's true out in the rest of the world.
[02:20:31.252 --> 02:20:33.495]  So it will be really interesting to see what happens.
[02:20:33.535 --> 02:20:35.458]  Let's just pray to God that nothing does happen.
[02:20:36.179 --> 02:20:43.168]  The other thing I wanted to say, though, is that I've been doing a lot of reading recently around the whole sort of origins of the New World Order.
[02:20:43.669 --> 02:20:47.414]  I don't know if you, Alex, have ever come across this author, Dennis Wheatley, have you?
[02:20:49.096 --> 02:20:49.756]  It rings a bell.
[02:20:50.237 --> 02:20:56.540]  Dennis Wheatley was one of the most prolific authors that came out of Britain in the 1930s, 40s, 50s, and 60s.
[02:20:57.341 --> 02:21:00.523]  And there was a couple of films made about his books.
[02:21:00.623 --> 02:21:03.244]  One of the most famous is called The Devil Rides Out.
[02:21:03.785 --> 02:21:08.287]  But back in 1941, I discovered Dennis talking about the New World Order.
[02:21:08.848 --> 02:21:14.391]  And this also joins the dots between the Second World War and the current conflict.
[02:21:15.266 --> 02:21:20.310]  What he's saying is that in the New World Order, all family life will be at an end, except for the conquerors.
[02:21:20.830 --> 02:21:28.116]  And only the worst elements, spiritually, will be allowed to procreate fresh generations to populate a world divided into masters and slaves.
[02:21:28.536 --> 02:21:32.379]  Now that was 1941 he wrote that, under the shadow of the Second World War.
[02:21:32.659 --> 02:21:33.840]  Well, that's what they're obsessed with.
[02:21:33.880 --> 02:21:35.461]  It's the eugenics empire.
[02:21:36.122 --> 02:21:38.263]  And instead we argue about who exactly runs it.
[02:21:38.323 --> 02:21:40.285]  Well, we know what they're carrying out.
[02:21:40.685 --> 02:21:42.506]  I tell you what, Tony, can you stay with us five more minutes?
[02:21:42.546 --> 02:21:43.707]  I want to hear you talk more about this.
[02:21:44.088 --> 02:21:46.249]  Okay, he thinks Milderberg already happened.
[02:21:46.750 --> 02:21:50.192]  This is true, it's horrible news, but we'll continue to cover it on the other side.
[02:21:51.013 --> 02:21:51.933]  We're on the march.
[02:21:52.414 --> 02:21:54.015]  The empire's on the run.
[02:21:54.936 --> 02:21:57.618]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:22:01.281 --> 02:22:02.101]  Attention gardeners!
[02:22:02.181 --> 02:22:04.522]  This is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[02:22:04.762 --> 02:22:09.103]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[02:22:09.304 --> 02:22:17.166]  It's called Proto-Gro and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[02:22:17.486 --> 02:22:20.327]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[02:22:20.607 --> 02:22:28.129]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[02:22:28.249 --> 02:22:33.811]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[02:22:34.051 --> 02:22:39.614]  Proto-Gro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[02:22:39.894 --> 02:22:43.196]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[02:22:43.456 --> 02:22:46.798]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[02:22:47.038 --> 02:22:52.081]  GCN listeners who want to grow dirt cheap superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[02:22:52.101 --> 02:22:54.963]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:22:55.023 --> 02:22:55.203]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:23:00.956 --> 02:23:02.336]  Wake up, Protestant America!
[02:23:02.556 --> 02:23:06.077]  There is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state.
[02:23:06.237 --> 02:23:12.138]  This confederation of evangelicals, Catholics, and Protestant denominations will form one huge political voting bloc.
[02:23:12.278 --> 02:23:16.039]  Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation.
[02:23:16.339 --> 02:23:20.840]  Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom, liberty of conscience.
[02:23:21.100 --> 02:23:24.360]  History and the Bible prove to them that these two systems... Hey, John!
[02:23:24.540 --> 02:23:25.561]  ...must be kept separate.
[02:23:25.761 --> 02:23:27.181]  It must be our love of God... Yes, sir?
[02:23:28.399 --> 02:23:30.720]  And yes, listeners, I know you can all hear us here.
[02:23:30.760 --> 02:23:32.280]  This is the new way we do the radio show.
[02:23:34.500 --> 02:23:36.801]  We have secret info behind the scenes.
[02:23:37.521 --> 02:23:40.722]  One time I put a video out of me and Humphrey talking and they went, we got it live!
[02:23:40.762 --> 02:23:41.502]  They didn't know!
[02:23:41.522 --> 02:23:42.582]  So funny.
[02:23:45.223 --> 02:23:47.403]  Get that CNN hit piece on us.
[02:23:47.483 --> 02:23:47.964]  Ready, please?
[02:23:48.384 --> 02:23:48.784]  I sure do.
[02:23:48.824 --> 02:23:49.324]  It's all set.
[02:23:49.364 --> 02:23:51.504]  It's seven minutes and eleven seconds.
[02:23:51.524 --> 02:23:52.585]  Yeah, I'll just play a few minutes of it.
[02:23:52.605 --> 02:23:53.205]  Thank you, Keebler.
[02:23:53.385 --> 02:23:53.825]  No problem.
[02:23:54.787 --> 02:23:59.630]  The Bible says, Box 99, Lenore City, Tennessee, 37771.
[02:24:00.310 --> 02:24:04.573]  Prepare for an uncertain future with DVDs from the winner of 12 Telly Awards.
[02:24:04.713 --> 02:24:07.755]  Hoods Woods is the world leader in survival instructional videos.
[02:24:07.875 --> 02:24:17.160]  Hoods Woods produces an outstanding collection of survival DVDs from cave cooking to survival basics to home survival DVDs covering topics such as food storage and home emergency planning.
[02:24:17.220 --> 02:24:20.282]  You will learn survival techniques for use in the wild and in your village.
[02:24:34.957 --> 02:24:35.517]  We're good to go.
[02:25:24.068 --> 02:25:32.250]  Yeah, I got a smile for everybody I meet, unless you don't try to
[02:25:52.705 --> 02:25:54.946]  Take my baby or drop a bomb on my street.
[02:25:54.966 --> 02:26:04.230]  These control freaks love the fact they can inject you with their bioweapons and the vaccines, carry out their eugenics against you.
[02:26:05.230 --> 02:26:09.972]  I did a pre-interview with Tony Gosling and here he is bringing up eugenics, bringing up their program, bringing up their control.
[02:26:10.432 --> 02:26:13.013]  He's bringing up an author who had this figured out back during the 40s.
[02:26:13.033 --> 02:26:13.974]  I've heard that name.
[02:26:14.834 --> 02:26:15.954]  Tell me more about that guy.
[02:26:16.455 --> 02:26:17.115]  This is interesting.
[02:26:17.575 --> 02:26:20.317]  Dennis was actually a Second World War hero.
[02:26:20.757 --> 02:26:27.801]  He was a writer in the 30s, but he was also very close to people like Alistair Crowley and some of these occultists.
[02:26:28.642 --> 02:26:32.404]  So he was actually kind of into the white magic style thing.
[02:26:33.445 --> 02:26:38.248]  So he met around these people and he knew what they were up to, so he spelt them out.
[02:26:38.328 --> 02:26:39.648]  So what's his name again, Dennis what?
[02:26:40.049 --> 02:26:42.890]  It's Dennis Wheatley, W-H-E-A-T-L-E-Y.
[02:26:43.071 --> 02:26:43.831]  I've heard that name.
[02:26:44.391 --> 02:26:57.882]  Now, one of the weird things is that there was a big copyright battle just after he died, and so his material, even though it was published, as I said, in the 30s, right the way up to the 70s, there's hardly been any copies of his books printed at all since then.
[02:26:58.182 --> 02:27:03.586]  So you have to get on to, you know, sort of second-hand bookshops and that kind of thing to get hold of Dennis' stuff.
[02:27:03.606 --> 02:27:04.787]  Okay, but he knew about the New World Order.
[02:27:04.827 --> 02:27:05.348]  What did he say?
[02:27:05.948 --> 02:27:08.932]  Well, he said, as I just explained to you, that stuff.
[02:27:08.972 --> 02:27:15.079]  He was also writing about, he said that Winston Churchill, he believed, was a member of the Illuminati, of Adam Weishaupt.
[02:27:15.560 --> 02:27:16.821]  He said that in one of his books.
[02:27:16.921 --> 02:27:19.604]  Well, he was a public member of the Druids.
[02:27:20.365 --> 02:27:22.768]  Well, yes, but he's talking about the Illuminati now.
[02:27:23.929 --> 02:27:32.314]  Of course, we need to get serious about this Illuminati stuff, because if you go back far enough, there's plenty of evidence that these people very much did exist.
[02:27:32.774 --> 02:27:40.158]  And the main people who were exposing the Illuminati, back in the time that they very first started, was actually a Freemason himself.
[02:27:40.918 --> 02:27:49.624]  He exposed it, John Robeson, because he could see the way that Freemasonry was being twisted by these people and infiltrated.
[02:27:49.984 --> 02:27:53.747]  George Washington, by the way, before he died, came out against it as well.
[02:27:53.787 --> 02:28:04.294]  Now let's be clear, if we say all Masons are these wicked devils, they're going to think we're liars because most of them are porch Masons, lower down in the pyramidal structure, not at the capstone.
[02:28:04.794 --> 02:28:13.744]  But we need to explain that they used the mechanism of the Masonic system to take over and then forge their Illuminati, this subversive political arm funded
[02:28:15.541 --> 02:28:25.023]  Well, the other thing Dennis Wheatley says is that the right to homes and children of their own would be reserved for the overlords.
[02:28:25.103 --> 02:28:28.124]  The rest would be herded into barracks and reduced to the level of robots.
[02:28:36.406 --> 02:28:37.087]  Yeah, very nice people!
[02:29:04.547 --> 02:29:13.469]  Yeah, but I find it fascinating that he was talking about all this stuff all that time ago, and then we see this whole idea of Hitler being this kind of man-god as he was at the time.
[02:29:14.090 --> 02:29:21.631]  I think that's what we're going to be seeing in the future, someone coming along to do a similar kind of thing, obviously much better spun than Hitler was.
[02:29:24.052 --> 02:29:30.199]  Also, I mean, we're seeing in Britain now, I mean, I don't know how much you follow British politics, a really incredible attack on Gordon Brown.
[02:29:30.379 --> 02:29:32.341]  Yeah, I follow it closely.
[02:29:32.481 --> 02:29:35.384]  I think it's all psychological tactics.
[02:29:35.444 --> 02:29:41.550]  If you go back to the mid-70s, you'll see that the secret state in Britain attacked Harold Wilson in a very similar way.
[02:29:42.210 --> 02:29:47.235]  Gordon Brown, I mean, he was one of the people who was part of the cabinet that signed up to the war, the Iraq war.
[02:29:47.756 --> 02:29:51.658]  He signed up to have England enter the EU, and he's thrown New World Order.
[02:29:51.758 --> 02:30:13.770]  You do wonder if maybe he had his fingers crossed behind his back at the time, because a lot of the stuff he's doing now is really kind of in what we would call, I suppose, Christian Socialist principles, old-fashioned Socialist principles, which is to do with making sure that the poor are reasonably well looked after, that some of the, at least of the nationalized industries, like our National Health Service over here, is preserved,
[02:30:14.570 --> 02:30:15.030]  I think so.
[02:30:31.738 --> 02:30:42.382]  Yeah, that was actually an Israeli General.
[02:30:43.302 --> 02:30:48.304]  Well, let's be clear, that was the Mayor of London helping try to put out the arrest warrant for him.
[02:30:48.344 --> 02:30:49.484]  Notice they just kicked him out.
[02:30:49.965 --> 02:30:56.427]  But expanding on that, so they were warning him to leave so they wouldn't get him on a warrant in London.
[02:30:59.728 --> 02:31:02.811]  I think it's more like getting rid of George Bush and putting in a Barack Obama.
[02:31:03.752 --> 02:31:11.498]  I think it's that they know that they're not moving the ball down the field, so they switch left-right, right-left, left-right, back and forth.
[02:31:11.638 --> 02:31:16.342]  You see, there are really two different sorts of leaders in the world today, at least in the Western world.
[02:31:17.683 --> 02:31:18.423]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:31:40.213 --> 02:31:41.494]  He has a heart attack.
[02:31:42.154 --> 02:31:58.905]  Well he had a big accident during an exercise up in a Scottish mountain and a helicopter came and took him away and refused to let his wife get in the helicopter with him and by the time, it was the helicopter of death, a bit like Diana's ambulance of death, when by the time he got to the hospital he was in a really terrible state and he died.
[02:31:59.185 --> 02:32:04.549]  So, you know, maybe Gordon Brown is only alive because he's a bit weak and easily manipulated.
[02:32:05.905 --> 02:32:08.746]  Well, I have no doubt that the Globalists are very, very serious people.
[02:32:08.806 --> 02:32:15.369]  So, bottom line, Tony Gosling from Mildenburg.org, you think they just had the meeting in Greece this weekend?
[02:32:15.710 --> 02:32:16.790]  I'm afraid so, Alex.
[02:32:16.830 --> 02:32:18.751]  Yep, looks like they've beaten us this year.
[02:32:18.791 --> 02:32:22.973]  I mean, we can't win every year, I suppose, and I just would ask your listeners,
[02:32:25.835 --> 02:32:31.001]  Let's try next year really hard to track down various hotels, looking at hotels.
[02:32:31.021 --> 02:32:33.644]  Are hotels free for that particular weekend?
[02:32:34.265 --> 02:32:36.647]  And to really give them a hard time.
[02:32:36.667 --> 02:32:38.970]  Let me just say this, in case you're wrong.
[02:32:40.091 --> 02:32:40.671]  Well, I could be.
[02:32:40.692 --> 02:32:47.256]  We need to keep looking for the location now, because this could be an elaborate foil.
[02:32:47.376 --> 02:32:48.938]  I think it's very unlikely.
[02:32:48.978 --> 02:32:49.818]  You're absolutely right.
[02:32:49.858 --> 02:32:50.699]  We don't know for sure.
[02:32:50.719 --> 02:32:51.740]  And it's always the case.
[02:32:51.760 --> 02:32:58.705]  I mean, as you know, Alex, going to these Bilderberg meetings, you're never 100% sure that you've got the right venue, the right time and the right place.
[02:32:58.725 --> 02:32:59.846]  Until you see David Rockefeller.
[02:33:00.586 --> 02:33:00.846]  Sorry?
[02:33:01.366 --> 02:33:02.687]  Until you see David Rockefeller.
[02:33:02.707 --> 02:33:10.611]  Well, once you actually fly to the venue, you turn up, and you actually turn up on the right morning, on the Thursday morning.
[02:33:11.191 --> 02:33:13.892]  And of course, you have to first be arrested getting off the plane.
[02:33:14.232 --> 02:33:19.815]  Of course, that's always a cue you're at the right city, right country too, because they then detain you and scream at you.
[02:33:21.016 --> 02:33:24.238]  We really have to work a little bit harder next year.
[02:33:24.299 --> 02:33:30.104]  I've been doing my best, but we need more people working on this to figure out where they're going to be next year.
[02:33:30.144 --> 02:33:32.906]  We don't want it to evade our attention next year.
[02:33:32.946 --> 02:33:38.992]  Tony Gosling, Bilderberg.org, thank you for popping in with us, and as this develops in the next few days, I'd like to have you visit with us again.
[02:33:39.052 --> 02:33:40.573]  Thank you for all your great reportage.
[02:33:40.894 --> 02:33:42.015]  Thank you, Alex, for all you do.
[02:33:42.355 --> 02:33:42.875]  Take care.
[02:33:43.395 --> 02:33:48.318]  Look, he's a credible guy and he does a lot of good work at his site and he's been right in the past.
[02:33:48.398 --> 02:33:49.398]  I hope he's wrong this time.
[02:33:49.738 --> 02:33:50.999]  We talked to Jim Tucker this morning.
[02:33:51.039 --> 02:33:55.321]  He doesn't think that he's been fooled and he hasn't ever been fooled yet.
[02:33:56.741 --> 02:34:02.444]  He has narrowly found out like a day before it starts and jumped on an all-nighter and flown, you know, 10 hours, 12 hours.
[02:34:03.684 --> 02:34:03.965]  I don't know.
[02:34:03.985 --> 02:34:04.465]  I've got to research.
[02:34:04.485 --> 02:34:04.986]  I'll come on tomorrow.
[02:34:19.008 --> 02:34:20.609]  I don't want to beat up on Tony Gosling.
[02:34:20.969 --> 02:34:22.089]  I think he's a good guy.
[02:34:22.249 --> 02:34:23.269]  I hope he's wrong, though.
[02:34:23.830 --> 02:34:29.011]  Because I hope that they haven't been able to hide this.
[02:34:29.051 --> 02:34:34.153]  But the fact that they're jumping through all these hoops to do it shows that they're very angry that they're getting so much press coverage.
[02:34:34.193 --> 02:34:39.735]  I mean, seven years ago, the New York Times said I was insane and believed an imaginary Bilderberg group.
[02:34:40.575 --> 02:34:46.117]  Just like I'm insane and Thimerosal wasn't in the vaccines, and then it was, but it's out, but Mercury's good for you.
[02:34:47.082 --> 02:34:49.024]  See, I mean, it's an insanity.
[02:34:50.185 --> 02:34:52.487]  Everything they do is just so crazy.
[02:34:52.867 --> 02:34:57.911]  Oh, Homeland Security, you talk about the Constitution, need to be arrested, that's terror code.
[02:34:57.931 --> 02:35:01.975]  Again, that sounds insane, but they're doing it.
[02:35:02.836 --> 02:35:04.197]  It's all happening.
[02:35:05.367 --> 02:35:07.928]  I'm going to take a lone caller here because he's been holding so long.
[02:35:07.948 --> 02:35:13.030]  I'm going to get into the latest Debra Jean Palfrey situation since people reminded me about it.
[02:35:13.530 --> 02:35:15.290]  James in Ohio, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:35:16.131 --> 02:35:16.371]  Alex.
[02:35:16.871 --> 02:35:17.551]  Hello my friend.
[02:35:18.311 --> 02:35:20.732]  I'm mad as hell and I'm not taking it anymore.
[02:35:22.213 --> 02:35:28.415]  I want to express the same sentiments your last caller had and let you know that
[02:35:29.176 --> 02:35:34.599]  I'm trying to get as many educational DVDs out there as I can.
[02:35:34.619 --> 02:35:39.281]  Endgame, Freedom to Fascism, Terror Storm.
[02:35:39.881 --> 02:35:42.443]  Just pass them out as much as I can.
[02:35:42.483 --> 02:35:45.624]  I'm limited income, so I do it on payday.
[02:35:45.664 --> 02:35:46.425]  I'll pass out about 25.
[02:35:46.585 --> 02:35:53.008]  If every one of our listeners would do that, we'd win this battle very, very quickly.
[02:35:53.720 --> 02:35:56.403]  Yeah, we gotta get together and really work at it.
[02:35:56.423 --> 02:35:58.365]  But no, I wanted to ask you a quick question.
[02:35:58.886 --> 02:36:03.531]  I'm doing a little bit of research on my own and I come across the red and the blue list.
[02:36:03.611 --> 02:36:04.092]  What do you know?
[02:36:06.194 --> 02:36:08.076]  Other countries always have a list.
[02:36:08.136 --> 02:36:11.921]  People that are to be arrested, people that are to be killed, people that are to be rounded up.
[02:36:14.349 --> 02:36:16.732]  And totalitarian regimes always have these.
[02:36:16.772 --> 02:36:18.254]  They're very hard to carry out.
[02:36:19.596 --> 02:36:24.823]  We see FEMA doing these type drills right now, and they've built camps, and they admit they want to put political dissidents in them.
[02:36:25.584 --> 02:36:31.773]  A lot of bank owners, a lot of well-known preachers, people have even served them on the list we picked up.
[02:36:33.827 --> 02:36:36.149]  If they try it, it'll be a big canary in the coal mine.
[02:36:36.189 --> 02:36:37.830]  I mean, the common person out there.
[02:36:38.891 --> 02:36:41.533]  The Feds also use this as propaganda, and I appreciate your call, James.
[02:36:41.553 --> 02:36:42.794]  Let me answer your question and move on.
[02:36:42.814 --> 02:36:50.419]  The Feds, and we know people that are Feds and people that put out this info, they love to run around and go, if you ever talk about the New World Order, you're on the list.
[02:36:50.499 --> 02:36:52.321]  If you ever visited a site, you're on it.
[02:36:52.701 --> 02:36:53.421]  Be afraid.
[02:36:53.501 --> 02:36:56.503]  Sit in your room with your knees knocking together.
[02:36:56.904 --> 02:36:58.005]  Don't go out in public.
[02:36:58.065 --> 02:36:59.245]  Hide secretly.
[02:37:00.326 --> 02:37:04.788]  Uh, meet with a militia person behind a barn in the middle of nowhere, bring weapons.
[02:37:05.248 --> 02:37:05.608]  That's it.
[02:37:06.148 --> 02:37:06.988]  Watch out the list.
[02:37:07.008 --> 02:37:08.329]  They're everywhere.
[02:37:10.129 --> 02:37:13.231]  You know, and then you go and it's feds.
[02:37:14.491 --> 02:37:15.311]  Uh, so what?
[02:37:16.072 --> 02:37:17.592]  I mean, they've got a million people.
[02:37:17.612 --> 02:37:25.335]  They keep giving the numbers out from like a year ago of nine hundred and something thousand, uh, nine hundred and ninety-four thousand on the terrorist list.
[02:37:26.175 --> 02:37:30.600]  And it said, a five-year-old girl takes a picture on the plane of their mother.
[02:37:31.100 --> 02:37:35.264]  The federal marshals protested last year and said, we have to put them on a list for the rest of their life if they're a terrorist.
[02:37:35.985 --> 02:37:37.066]  And then they said, we don't want to do this.
[02:37:37.106 --> 02:37:39.068]  We're told to make up that they're terrorists.
[02:37:39.128 --> 02:37:40.690]  I mean, it's made up.
[02:37:40.750 --> 02:37:41.391]  It's not real.
[02:37:41.951 --> 02:37:43.733]  It's all part of the hysteria, the backdrop.
[02:37:45.755 --> 02:37:54.003]  You ever sold a car and went in and normally you only get a thousand dollar paycheck every two weeks, but you deposited five thousand because you sold that old truck?
[02:37:54.664 --> 02:37:56.445]  You're on a terror list for the rest of your life.
[02:37:56.525 --> 02:37:59.568]  I mean, that's just, it's all about getting everyone on a terror list.
[02:38:00.129 --> 02:38:02.591]  Because the terrorists run the government and they're waging war on us.
[02:38:03.372 --> 02:38:04.293]  And so, so what?
[02:38:04.373 --> 02:38:05.134]  They're the terrorists.
[02:38:05.154 --> 02:38:08.096]  Let's put them on public list as traitor enemies of the Republic.
[02:38:09.994 --> 02:38:11.095]  You know, they can't get us all.
[02:38:11.115 --> 02:38:12.196]  They're not going to get us all.
[02:38:12.757 --> 02:38:14.939]  We can't be like the Germans and just go along with it.
[02:38:15.440 --> 02:38:17.001]  They always try to set it first.
[02:38:17.062 --> 02:38:18.583]  Well, it's just this minority.
[02:38:18.643 --> 02:38:19.884]  Just the gypsies first.
[02:38:21.546 --> 02:38:30.235]  And, you know, they've got a culture of robbing and cheating everybody else, so it's okay, cultural hygiene, to go ahead and arrest them and put them in labor camps.
[02:38:31.141 --> 02:38:31.881]  For their own good.
[02:38:33.182 --> 02:38:37.143]  And then it's another group, and then another group, and then another group, and then another group.
[02:38:37.783 --> 02:38:40.083]  But the main target's always the German people.
[02:38:40.403 --> 02:38:41.644]  It's always the American people.
[02:38:41.684 --> 02:38:42.724]  It's always the British people.
[02:38:42.784 --> 02:38:44.945]  It's always... So see, they beta test.
[02:38:45.005 --> 02:38:49.986]  As Rex84 says, the government says, we'll claim it's for illegal aliens, but it'll be for the citizens.
[02:38:50.726 --> 02:38:52.287]  And see, now you see that happening.
[02:38:52.787 --> 02:38:58.991]  As they kind of, yeah, they're a roundup of rest teams, and they're putting people through the cattle shoots in Des Moines, Iowa.
[02:38:59.011 --> 02:39:03.253]  I mean, I've got the article, there's photos, there's video.
[02:39:05.755 --> 02:39:09.677]  So see, it's, oh, well, I like these teams that take you to sports stadiums.
[02:39:11.340 --> 02:39:12.821]  You know, that take you to the cattle pens.
[02:39:12.921 --> 02:39:14.682]  I mean, they're putting them through cattle pens.
[02:39:15.202 --> 02:39:16.483]  It's all a message.
[02:39:16.523 --> 02:39:18.584]  It's all, you can't talk about the Constitution.
[02:39:18.604 --> 02:39:19.805]  You're going to cattle pens.
[02:39:19.865 --> 02:39:21.606]  It's all archetypal.
[02:39:23.467 --> 02:39:32.173]  So they want us to all basically potty in our pantses and just all freak out in paranoia and run, when they're the traitors.
[02:39:32.213 --> 02:39:32.913]  They're the enemies.
[02:39:32.973 --> 02:39:33.674]  They're shameful.
[02:39:33.714 --> 02:39:34.474]  They're disgusting.
[02:39:34.975 --> 02:39:39.898]  They would have been able to carry this off if we hadn't have exposed that they're the terrorists.
[02:39:40.638 --> 02:39:44.201]  They would have been able to get away with this if we wouldn't have exposed that they carried out the attacks.
[02:39:44.661 --> 02:39:47.503]  Now most people know, now their credibility's blown.
[02:39:47.884 --> 02:39:48.704]  They're in deep trouble.
[02:39:49.045 --> 02:39:54.029]  They're just trying to move through things and use their great mass and inertia to follow through.
[02:39:54.049 --> 02:39:55.250]  Alright, shifting gears.
[02:39:56.551 --> 02:40:01.975]  But yeah, there are some lists about who's to be arrested and who's to be killed and they really do have a list of people.
[02:40:02.956 --> 02:40:05.237]  I assure you I'm on the red list, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:40:05.598 --> 02:40:06.178]  Do I care?
[02:40:06.198 --> 02:40:09.201]  I get out on the highway every day, deadly dangerous, and I do it.
[02:40:10.031 --> 02:40:12.014]  Because I want to be able to travel and I enjoy driving.
[02:40:12.895 --> 02:40:18.683]  Do I, uh, you know, cry and whine and, oh my god, I'm on the driving list?
[02:40:19.244 --> 02:40:19.445]  No!
[02:40:20.085 --> 02:40:24.472]  And is there a small chance, much smaller compared to dying in an automobile accident, that it'll come get me and kill me?
[02:40:24.692 --> 02:40:24.912]  Yeah!
[02:40:25.874 --> 02:40:26.874]  But, I mean, I'm a man.
[02:40:26.954 --> 02:40:30.396]  I mean, it's about, you know, going, well, I'm fighting a bunch of scum.
[02:40:30.456 --> 02:40:31.836]  I mean, they might come kill me.
[02:40:32.636 --> 02:40:34.997]  I hope that doesn't happen, but do I take a lot of precautions?
[02:40:35.017 --> 02:40:35.877]  Do I run around in fear?
[02:40:35.937 --> 02:40:40.119]  No, I just kind of go, well, you know, they're a bunch of dime-core child kidnappers.
[02:40:40.159 --> 02:40:41.599]  I've got to speak out against them, you know.
[02:40:42.660 --> 02:40:50.703]  It's not, I mean, the fact that we have to ask ourselves if we should do this, the fact that we have to question whether we should even speak out or do something,
[02:40:52.103 --> 02:40:53.404]  Shows why we're in so much trouble.
[02:40:54.184 --> 02:40:55.584]  Now listen to this CNN piece.
[02:40:55.604 --> 02:40:56.865]  This is a CNN Prime Saturday.
[02:40:56.905 --> 02:41:08.469]  I've never played it because I'm frankly only talking about myself, but it's an important issue because they imply that, oh well, they claim that she thought she might be being followed.
[02:41:08.509 --> 02:41:10.450]  No, she said, I think there's a hit out on me.
[02:41:11.050 --> 02:41:14.153]  And then, oh, people claim she said that this was going... No, no, she said this.
[02:41:14.853 --> 02:41:19.337]  Or, oh, her manager says the handwriting doesn't look the same, and they use one little example.
[02:41:20.758 --> 02:41:26.482]  And, oh, well, you know, that's just how... So they basically just put out a bunch of disinfo, and it really is shameful.
[02:41:26.522 --> 02:41:26.943]  Here that is.
[02:41:28.197 --> 02:41:28.837]  I don't know.
[02:41:46.429 --> 02:41:47.090]  Yeah, hey there, Rick.
[02:41:47.150 --> 02:41:49.431]  One of the most prominent blogs taking a look at this is right here.
[02:41:49.451 --> 02:41:54.314]  It's called PrisonPlanet.com, and they've been talking about this very frequently, at times every day.
[02:41:54.574 --> 02:41:59.777]  They have, for example, this one piece that says, her friend said that that's not her signature on the suicide note.
[02:41:59.797 --> 02:42:02.979]  Let me scroll down a little bit, show you the kinds of things that are going on online.
[02:42:02.999 --> 02:42:08.142]  They're putting together a piece, a signature that they've seen from her, or rather a piece of handwriting they've seen of her before.
[02:42:08.702 --> 02:42:10.825]  And her handwriting on her suicide note.
[02:42:10.845 --> 02:42:12.607]  They're saying, was she forced to do this?
[02:42:12.787 --> 02:42:13.989]  Is it even really hers?
[02:42:14.349 --> 02:42:22.139]  Also, this same site at another point talks about, look, they say, even the Washington Post said that after she went to jail, she would have been able to make all this money.
[02:42:22.179 --> 02:42:23.000]  She would have been famous.
[02:42:23.241 --> 02:42:24.542]  There would have been book deals, movies.
[02:42:24.582 --> 02:42:25.784]  Why would she possibly do this?
[02:42:26.084 --> 02:42:31.149]  So these are the kinds of things people were batting back and forth and saying, hey, does it even make sense that she would have committed suicide?
[02:42:31.189 --> 02:42:41.017]  Well, you know, when it comes to handwriting, I can tell you just from some of the studies that we've done in the past, say that there's no actual definitive way of breaking down what somebody's handwriting.
[02:42:41.057 --> 02:42:46.963]  Then they come back and say, actually, women do hang themselves a lot less than men, but it's not that big of a difference.
[02:42:47.403 --> 02:42:52.264]  And then they add into that asphyxiation by carbon monoxide, a bunch of other stuff.
[02:42:52.364 --> 02:42:54.105]  I mean, it's just, these guys are tough.
[02:42:54.425 --> 02:43:00.727]  The same guy, that same day I was watching him at the beach, was saying the police did a good job of those people beating him.
[02:43:01.327 --> 02:43:02.707]  It is a big idea.
[02:43:02.727 --> 02:43:04.848]  A new world order.
[02:43:05.568 --> 02:43:10.390]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:43:10.470 --> 02:43:13.250]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:43:13.290 --> 02:43:15.451]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[02:43:16.064 --> 02:43:18.507]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:43:19.248 --> 02:43:26.577]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:43:29.577 --> 02:43:34.560]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:43:35.061 --> 02:43:38.543]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:43:38.903 --> 02:43:41.405]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:43:41.485 --> 02:43:42.626]  Most people have no idea.
[02:43:42.646 --> 02:43:43.406]  They're not after money.
[02:43:43.426 --> 02:43:44.507]  They have all the money they need.
[02:43:44.707 --> 02:43:45.428]  They're after power.
[02:43:45.448 --> 02:43:46.528]  That's what they're after these years.
[02:43:46.849 --> 02:43:51.372]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[02:43:51.592 --> 02:43:55.054]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:43:55.214 --> 02:43:58.296]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:43:58.356 --> 02:43:59.397]  You have been warned.
[02:44:00.244 --> 02:44:00.810]  Hey, Emily.
[02:44:01.072 --> 02:44:01.214]  What?
[02:44:06.408 --> 02:44:06.888]  How does it work?
[02:44:07.068 --> 02:44:13.670]  MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from your body.
[02:44:13.810 --> 02:44:16.111]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[02:44:16.291 --> 02:44:21.692]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[02:44:21.972 --> 02:44:22.452]  That's it?
[02:44:22.732 --> 02:44:24.273]  It sounds so easy and convenient.
[02:44:24.513 --> 02:44:25.213]  It is easy.
[02:44:25.413 --> 02:44:32.075]  Plus, the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[02:44:32.395 --> 02:44:33.916]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[02:44:34.236 --> 02:44:34.937]  That's amazing!
[02:44:35.337 --> 02:44:40.760]  And the Benzonite Clay and MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[02:44:41.040 --> 02:44:41.361]  Wow!
[02:44:41.561 --> 02:44:42.681]  Where can I buy MediCleanse?
[02:44:42.942 --> 02:44:45.803]  A one-month supply is available online at MediCleanse.com.
[02:44:45.883 --> 02:44:49.085]  That's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E dot com.
[02:44:49.225 --> 02:44:52.648]  For only $22.95 plus shipping, MediCleanse is shipped directly to you.
[02:44:52.808 --> 02:44:53.428]  Or call them at 1-800-317-9547.
[02:44:53.448 --> 02:44:53.648]  That's 1-800-317-9547.
[02:44:53.668 --> 02:44:53.928]  Call today.
[02:45:00.172 --> 02:45:01.234]  Why should we fire Congress?
[02:45:01.454 --> 02:45:04.918]  Because they use the Constitution of the United States as a scrap of paper.
[02:45:05.058 --> 02:45:07.140]  They swear an oath to follow it, and then they reject it.
[02:45:07.380 --> 02:45:10.044]  That was their employment document.
[02:45:10.184 --> 02:45:10.925]  They haven't followed it.
[02:45:11.245 --> 02:45:12.987]  Congressmen, Senators, you're fired.
[02:45:13.147 --> 02:45:14.829]  Washington, you're fired!
[02:45:15.029 --> 02:45:16.610]  I think it's the next freedom to fascism.
[02:45:17.050 --> 02:45:23.514]  Washington You're Fired was born out of sheer frustration with abuses in our current political system, and it gives a voice to Americans across the country.
[02:45:23.954 --> 02:45:39.563]  Washington You're Fired examines constitutional issues as they relate to the Katrina disaster, the President's illegal spy program, NSA data mining, FISA's secret court, the illegal wiretapping of millions of Americans, and the last seven years of terror-related spy bills, how they affect you, and what you can do about it.
[02:45:40.004 --> 02:45:44.006]  Washington You're Fired captures the spirit and zest of an old-fashioned Boston Tea Party,
[02:45:44.366 --> 02:45:47.710]  Cam Williams describes the film as a rabble-rousing call to arms.
[02:45:48.231 --> 02:45:49.773]  We invite you to make the change with us.
[02:45:50.114 --> 02:45:51.375]  Help take back our government now.
[02:45:51.676 --> 02:45:55.661]  Go to TakeBackWashington.com and get the video tools you need for the information war.

[02:46:29.868 --> 02:46:35.313]  John Harmon, running the show up in Minnesota, Billy Bob down here in Austin, Texas, doing a great job as well.
[02:46:35.853 --> 02:46:44.780]  I want to be sure and ask you, John, remind me, I keep forgetting, to play that seven minute hit piece tomorrow, because I don't want to
[02:46:45.851 --> 02:46:48.592]  Not due justice to Debra Jean Palfrey.
[02:46:48.632 --> 02:46:50.994]  I've also been called by the local detective there.
[02:46:51.014 --> 02:46:54.055]  He actually called me when I was out of town last week.
[02:46:54.095 --> 02:46:54.935]  I haven't called him yet.
[02:46:55.936 --> 02:46:58.977]  I'm going to call him when the show ends and I'll have some tidbits for you tomorrow.
[02:46:59.778 --> 02:47:03.639]  I mean, I've got to do justice here to this hit piece that they did.
[02:47:03.659 --> 02:47:06.481]  I am not going to go over four hours today.
[02:47:06.501 --> 02:47:08.642]  I am not going to be doing that.
[02:47:10.407 --> 02:47:14.790]  When the show ends in about three minutes, that will be it.
[02:47:14.870 --> 02:47:29.640]  And then if you want to hear any of the first hour, second hour, third hour, fourth hour that you missed on Bilderberg developments, did they really meet, with Robert Galen Ross talking about the economy and his take on what's happening there, that will restart at the InfoWars stream.
[02:47:29.660 --> 02:47:31.021]  Those are separate from Genesis streams.

[02:47:35.485 --> 02:47:37.327]  You've got to go there, right there to listen.
[02:47:38.188 --> 02:47:43.853]  Also, don't forget that your support makes this broadcast possible, and that means support of our sponsors.

[02:47:49.258 --> 02:47:50.298]  We're very, very thankful to them.
[02:47:52.563 --> 02:48:02.104]  I also want to tell you that I appreciate Interfood, Aloe Ease, and eFoods Direct, and I just want everybody to be sure and visit the
[02:48:03.866 --> 02:48:08.807]  Aloe's website, the overall company, of course, is New Vitality.
[02:48:08.987 --> 02:48:10.328]  Hundreds of great products.
[02:48:10.988 --> 02:48:18.730]  These are well-known, well-designed herbs and different solid foods, superfoods that are very well-known.
[02:48:18.750 --> 02:48:19.890]  They have hundreds of products.
[02:48:19.970 --> 02:48:20.650]  New Vitality.

[02:49:38.781 --> 02:49:40.822]  Last more than 10 years in climate control.
[02:49:40.842 --> 02:49:42.783]  10 years in non-climate control.
[02:49:42.864 --> 02:49:46.746]  You need to give eFoods Direct a call and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:49:46.766 --> 02:49:47.886]  At least get a free brochure.
