[00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:01.010]  It is November 18, 2008.
[00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:03.331]  We've got an hour and 52 minutes left in this transmission.
[00:00:03.451 --> 00:00:05.752]  Broadcasting on the AM and FM dial.
[00:00:24.386 --> 00:00:33.336]  Transmitting and streaming over the web at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com as well as over different satellite systems.
[00:00:34.177 --> 00:00:36.139]  This is the Alex Jones Radio Show.
[00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:37.621]  I am Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:46.764]  And our guest is Alan Watt of CuttingThroughTheMatrix.com, again for the next hour and 51 minutes.
[00:00:46.924 --> 00:00:56.371]  Now, I know that we have Don in Costa Rica, Jimmy in Kentucky, Dustin and others holding over from the last hour, but Alan can speak to any subjects you want to call in about.
[00:00:56.391 --> 00:00:58.552]  If you want to talk to Alan Watt, it's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:02.014]  I have a lot of questions I want to ask Alan.
[00:01:02.034 --> 00:01:08.579]  I want to have discussions with him and try to bring both of our knowledge of the New World Order and all of our knowledge together to a higher level.
[00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.745]  Because to defeat the enemy, you have to know who they are and what their agenda is.
[00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:18.675]  But we will start going to your calls in T-minus 20 minutes when we come out of the bottom of the hour break.
[00:01:18.695 --> 00:01:19.597]  So everybody be patient.
[00:01:20.018 --> 00:01:22.862]  We're going to get to everybody who is patiently holding.
[00:01:24.261 --> 00:01:32.965]  But Alan, last hour I had a caller call in, Mike from California, saying, well if they're saying they plan to kill 80% of us, how do they plan to do that?
[00:01:32.985 --> 00:01:35.266]  And I was explaining to him that it's incremental.
[00:01:35.306 --> 00:01:48.293]  First they've got to socialize us, get us under government control, being regulated, being tracked, being traced, in government schools, where they always have things more far advanced than they are for the adults.
[00:01:48.633 --> 00:01:52.095]  This is all part of, like programming, bringing in the new model.
[00:01:52.675 --> 00:01:55.378]  You know, flushing out the old info, putting in the new.
[00:01:55.718 --> 00:01:58.260]  Reducing the language, semantically reducing the language.
[00:01:59.501 --> 00:02:02.944]  Drugging, poisoning, sterilizing the population.
[00:02:02.984 --> 00:02:05.106]  We have all the numbers on that, I want to go over that.
[00:02:05.426 --> 00:02:14.434]  But out of the gates, I wanted to ask you, because I've seen a lot of this in there, Club of Rome planning, UN planning, biological diversity assessments.
[00:02:15.395 --> 00:02:16.256]  We've seen a lot of it.
[00:02:17.681 --> 00:02:37.601]  In the university-level documents they're putting out, what the Rand Corporation is saying, what the British Ministry of Defense said last year that I know you covered extensively, as we did here, where they admit that there's a global elite and they're waging war against the individual, that they're putting in robotic aircraft so they can replace humans, even refusing to say nerve gas large cities.
[00:02:38.782 --> 00:02:50.626]  So can you walk through how, from the pieces we have, and I know you've researched the same stuff I have and even more in some cases because I hear you, I read you, I know it's all on target because it's from the Enemy's Own Manual.
[00:02:50.666 --> 00:02:52.867]  So for listeners, this is not our opinion here.
[00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:55.148]  But again, they leave gaps in it.
[00:02:55.748 --> 00:03:00.891]  They explain a lot of it, but then it's all compartmentalized and partitioned.
[00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:01.892]  You have to put it all together.
[00:03:02.532 --> 00:03:22.583]  And they're not clear on time frames, but they want to use global war, global famine, controlled bioweapons releases, to train us with each terror attack, each bioweapons release, being bigger, to live in a more and more controlled society, in the name of keeping us safe, to get us finally in that totally controlled technological enslavement grid,
[00:03:23.443 --> 00:03:27.884]  Yes, well, as far as bringing the population down, it's already happening.
[00:03:28.024 --> 00:03:29.085]  It's been happening for 50 years.
[00:03:29.105 --> 00:03:31.405]  And their own statistics prove it.
[00:03:48.798 --> 00:03:53.701]  I've read reports this last week or so from official reports on the sterilization of males.
[00:03:54.422 --> 00:04:06.430]  The CBC television, Canada, that's the BBC version of the Canadians, came out with a documentary called The Disappearing Male, where we're now at 85% or more sterile.
[00:04:07.431 --> 00:04:10.633]  Yeah, the West is dying from Russia to Japan to the United States.
[00:04:10.673 --> 00:04:17.698]  First World is dying at about 3-4% a year, but to be clear, you mean they've slowed down the global growth?
[00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:19.371]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:04:19.411 --> 00:04:31.159]  And there's more girls being born than boys now because the boys have been attacked in the womb by bisphenol A and phthalates, which literally alter the biological makeup of the male.
[00:04:31.179 --> 00:04:34.602]  It attacks his endocrine system at the age of seven weeks as a fetus.
[00:04:35.542 --> 00:04:38.825]  And we're seeing them today, the feminine males.
[00:04:39.505 --> 00:04:42.566]  They're much slimmer, they have no shoulders.
[00:04:42.926 --> 00:05:04.132]  Let's not glaze over that, and this is again, main government documents, CBC broadcast, what Alan and I have already covered, but there it was, codified, the baby boys are dying in the womb, en masse, being targeted, if they make it out, I don't want to even say they're feminine, they're an emasculated male, whose literal glands do not develop.
[00:05:04.432 --> 00:05:05.232]  Alan, please continue.
[00:05:05.672 --> 00:05:08.193]  Yeah, and also in that same documentary,
[00:05:09.201 --> 00:05:18.545]  They said that 10 years ago they could take sperm samples from young healthy males in college around the age of 18 and they had 60 million
[00:05:22.356 --> 00:05:47.514]  sperm per million liter and now the new normal is 10 million per million liter so that's how far it's dropped and so they keep dropping the normal sperm count for males and then sperm that's left is a motile dysfunctional it doesn't find the target it cannot go to the ovum so technically most males today are almost completely sterile
[00:05:48.257 --> 00:05:49.477]  And this is well understood.
[00:05:49.497 --> 00:05:55.480]  They've been studying this for 50 years, as only now they're releasing what they've always known for the last 50 years.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:14.166]  And you have to go back 50 years to the writings of Charles Galton Darwin, who came up with his book, The Next Million Years, where he outlines, on behalf of the elites, the different techniques of doing this very thing, sterilizing the population, primarily targeting the males, and reducing them drastically.
[00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.131]  So it has been happening.
[00:06:16.151 --> 00:06:20.594]  People are always looking for a big apocalypse, and it doesn't happen that way.
[00:06:21.095 --> 00:06:26.258]  It happens gradually, quietly, and the big mainstream media make no big deal about it.
[00:06:26.318 --> 00:06:28.320]  Explain that, because you do that very well.
[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.983]  I mean, they state it's silent weapons for quiet wars.
[00:06:32.043 --> 00:06:34.905]  They slowly turn up the ambient chemicals.
[00:06:35.345 --> 00:06:36.705]  It's complete all-out warfare.
[00:07:01.392 --> 00:07:04.493]  And, you know, he discussed this with Charles Galton Darwin.
[00:07:04.533 --> 00:07:06.973]  He was a physicist in the 1950s.
[00:07:07.913 --> 00:07:11.194]  And you'll find Arthur Koestler also worked at the United Nations.
[00:07:11.694 --> 00:07:13.214]  Arthur Koestler is admitted now.
[00:07:13.315 --> 00:07:15.335]  Koestler was a member of MI5, MI6.
[00:07:17.075 --> 00:07:20.096]  And he taught at a university in New York for a while.
[00:07:20.796 --> 00:07:21.916]  He worked for the United Nations.
[00:07:21.976 --> 00:07:26.157]  And he wrote about this necessity as well of vastly reducing the population.
[00:07:26.597 --> 00:07:30.218]  They're using the same techniques, in fact, they've been using on animals
[00:07:30.811 --> 00:07:39.013]  And basically animal management and the forestry commissions, they target primarily the males to bring their population down drastically.
[00:07:39.273 --> 00:07:40.453]  Same techniques we use chemically.
[00:07:40.473 --> 00:07:48.075]  Now they've been putting out baits to chemically sterilize badgers and foxes and again it's all done just like you manage animals.
[00:07:48.095 --> 00:07:48.775]  They even say that.
[00:07:48.815 --> 00:07:49.355]  Go ahead please.
[00:07:49.856 --> 00:07:55.517]  Yes, they actually call it herd management when they discuss humans in the medical societies now openly.
[00:07:56.768 --> 00:07:58.129]  So this has been happening.
[00:07:58.149 --> 00:08:00.231]  We're seeing all the other side effects.
[00:08:00.692 --> 00:08:15.303]  As the sperm count drops and the endocrine system is severely attacked in young men, their IQ level is dropping as well, which also explains why they can't catch on to the big picture of what's happening around them.
[00:08:15.624 --> 00:08:18.946]  They literally don't have the ability to see what's happening.
[00:08:19.567 --> 00:08:24.311]  And that again ties in with the big planning committees who discussed this with
[00:08:25.172 --> 00:08:25.573]  I think?
[00:08:42.927 --> 00:08:52.134]  If the men will never ever accept this new world order, this regimented system from birth to death... And that's why they prozac and riddle in the boys.
[00:08:52.635 --> 00:08:54.416]  That's why they target them for a fist fight.
[00:08:54.436 --> 00:08:59.700]  They go to jail now instead of doing, you know, being allowed to do their normal male activities.
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:05.484]  I mean, that'd be like arresting a baby pronghorn, you know, a juvenile pronghorn for, you know, for
[00:09:06.705 --> 00:09:10.786]  You know, challenging other males out on the grassy plains of New Mexico.
[00:09:11.286 --> 00:09:13.987]  All normal human activity is made criminal.
[00:09:14.027 --> 00:09:15.547]  The male is destroyed.
[00:09:16.567 --> 00:09:17.168]  That is correct.
[00:09:17.728 --> 00:09:23.429]  And as I say, they had a targeted IQ, very little testosterone working there.
[00:09:23.769 --> 00:09:25.450]  You technically are not a man anymore.
[00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:26.630]  You won't rebel.
[00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:28.090]  You won't stand up and fight.
[00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:29.731]  You won't even object.
[00:09:30.311 --> 00:09:31.151]  You're very placid.
[00:09:31.991 --> 00:09:35.772]  And again, this is well understood by herd management for animals.
[00:09:37.258 --> 00:09:43.723]  When you basically neuter a bull, he becomes very, very placid and he'll accept treatment quite easily.
[00:09:44.644 --> 00:09:45.445]  There's no objections.
[00:09:45.465 --> 00:09:47.206]  Well, that's happened in society.
[00:09:47.286 --> 00:09:53.071]  And the police now take steroids to supplement the fact that they've been basically neutered.
[00:09:53.292 --> 00:09:59.037]  And so that's the only sequestered area, though, where you're allowed to be male only if you're assaulting your own people, though.
[00:09:59.497 --> 00:10:00.258]  That is correct.
[00:10:00.418 --> 00:10:01.379]  That is absolutely correct.
[00:10:01.419 --> 00:10:04.101]  And of course, the guy is in charge of the military and the police.
[00:10:04.867 --> 00:10:05.568]  Please continue.
[00:10:33.226 --> 00:10:54.210]  Well, what's interesting, too, one of the main chemicals that is a synthetic hormone, the very things that Charles Galton Darwin was talking about and advocated was bisphenol A. Now, bisphenol A was understood, it was discovered in the 1800s, and in the 1930s, the chemical companies in the U.S.
[00:10:54.890 --> 00:11:00.672]  had done extensive experimentation with it and they found that it was an endocrine disruptor.
[00:11:01.032 --> 00:11:02.752]  It literally would attack male
[00:11:03.417 --> 00:11:04.478]  Uh, growth in the womb.
[00:11:04.978 --> 00:11:07.039]  So, what do they do with this bi-spinal aid?
[00:11:07.079 --> 00:11:10.822]  And they make it mandatory to use it to sterilize all babies' bottles.
[00:11:10.862 --> 00:11:16.185]  That's right, there's hundreds of types of plastic, but they find this one type of sterilizing rats and guinea pigs.
[00:11:16.745 --> 00:11:19.707]  And so they make sure there's universal adoption of that.
[00:11:19.987 --> 00:11:21.568]  How loving!
[00:11:22.108 --> 00:11:22.308]  Yes.
[00:11:23.069 --> 00:11:31.634]  And then, of course, they put it into the bottles themselves, and with heat, it leaches very quickly from the plastic feeding bottles for babies.
[00:11:32.339 --> 00:11:35.501]  And it's in the little teats they use, through the rubber teats.
[00:11:35.581 --> 00:11:37.381]  And in children it's even more devastating.
[00:11:37.862 --> 00:11:38.542]  Alan Watts, stay there.
[00:11:38.582 --> 00:11:39.863]  We're going to come back and talk more about this.
[00:11:40.223 --> 00:11:42.864]  Only one small facet of how you're under attack.
[00:11:43.124 --> 00:11:43.704]  Don't believe us.
[00:11:43.744 --> 00:11:44.885]  It's all true, all on record.
[00:11:44.905 --> 00:11:45.845]  They bragged how they would do it.
[00:11:46.426 --> 00:11:52.028]  Diet injections and injunctions will reduce you to the level of mutton.
[00:11:53.149 --> 00:11:53.649]  Or sheep.
[00:11:54.849 --> 00:11:56.450]  But mutton on the plate.
[00:11:57.611 --> 00:11:59.412]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:59.452 --> 00:12:00.052]  Stay with us.

[00:13:00.653 --> 00:13:07.040]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.002]  The enemy struck America on September 11.
[00:13:10.037 --> 00:13:11.078]  But who is the enemy?
[00:13:11.578 --> 00:13:12.118]  Bin Laden.
[00:13:12.379 --> 00:13:13.359]  This is his M.O.
[00:13:13.379 --> 00:13:14.680]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.401]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:13:16.741 --> 00:13:23.486]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:13:23.886 --> 00:13:24.326]  Some U.S.
[00:13:24.366 --> 00:13:30.050]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:34.232]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:13:34.593 --> 00:13:44.438]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:13:44.678 --> 00:13:45.439]  Fabled enemies.

[00:14:00.774 --> 00:14:02.216]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:14:02.416 --> 00:14:02.696]  November 18, 2008.
[00:14:02.776 --> 00:14:03.757]  Gold opened this morning at $733.90.
[00:14:03.797 --> 00:14:07.281]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $756.74, $378.37 for the half-ounce, and $189.18 for a quarter-ounce.
[00:14:07.301 --> 00:14:07.741]  That's $756.74, $378.37, and $189.18.
[00:14:18.294 --> 00:14:24.097]  There has been talk coming from the Council of Foreign Relations of forming an American Union combining Canada, Mexico, and the U.S.
[00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:25.618]  and erasing economic borders.
[00:14:25.818 --> 00:14:32.641]  Bush met with Vincent Fox, President of Mexico, Paul Martin, Prime Minister of Canada, discussing a security and prosperity partnership.
[00:14:32.841 --> 00:14:36.423]  The formation of a North American Union will have a great impact on the U.S.
[00:14:36.483 --> 00:14:36.983]  economy.
[00:14:37.243 --> 00:14:42.006]  Jerome R. Corsi published the document, The Plan to Replace the Dollar with the Emerald.
[00:14:42.226 --> 00:14:43.666]  The sovereignty of the U.S.
[00:14:43.927 --> 00:14:44.647]  is under attack.
[00:14:45.107 --> 00:14:48.509]  And Corsi uncovers the secrets and lies that surround the deceit.
[00:14:48.789 --> 00:14:50.029]  Call for your copy today 800-686-2237.
[00:14:50.049 --> 00:14:51.470]  We the people must take a stand.
[00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:51.890]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:52.230]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:15:00.626 --> 00:15:03.908]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[00:15:04.068 --> 00:15:08.151]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[00:15:08.331 --> 00:15:19.758]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[00:15:19.978 --> 00:15:25.822]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[00:15:26.062 --> 00:15:26.683]  We're good to go.
[00:15:47.458 --> 00:15:48.739]  Alan Watts, our guest.
[00:15:48.759 --> 00:15:49.860]  Call's coming up.
[00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:30.581]  Alan, of course you've only covered one tiny area of this and they just throw it in your face that they knew in the studies over a hundred years ago what this would do and they said we'll put it in the in the plastics.
[00:16:30.801 --> 00:16:32.442]  Put it in the liners for the tin cans.
[00:16:33.023 --> 00:16:40.829]  Put it in everything and more importantly they said let's put fluoride, sodium fluoride in the water.
[00:16:41.389 --> 00:16:43.571]  We have the documents on that but then they just laugh at us.
[00:16:45.353 --> 00:16:46.614]  Please continue Alan Watt.
[00:16:47.659 --> 00:16:50.081]  Yes, what you have is a multi-pronged attack.
[00:16:50.641 --> 00:16:57.565]  When you look at your victim, or your enemy in warfare, you must study the enemy, and the enemy are the people.
[00:16:58.286 --> 00:17:02.849]  You study them, you find out what their habits are, what do all people go through in stages, etc.
[00:17:03.589 --> 00:17:13.335]  How do they rear their young, you can conceive their young, where can you hit your target, you hit your target in the womb, preferably, if you want to stop major natural changes from occurring.
[00:17:13.715 --> 00:17:16.197]  You get in there first, and you cause abnormal changes.
[00:17:16.877 --> 00:17:19.959]  We've been under attack from so many areas, including the inoculations.
[00:17:20.379 --> 00:17:37.607]  Now Bertrand Russell, Lord Bertrand Russell, another member of MI5, who is now declassified again, along with Koestler and many other big writers of their time, who led big international meetings, he said himself that they'd also use the needle to make people very placid.
[00:17:38.548 --> 00:17:40.109]  Those are his words in one of his books.
[00:17:40.929 --> 00:17:42.750]  And they have been using inoculations.
[00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:46.572]  They train the public who are taught to trust their masters,
[00:17:47.398 --> 00:17:51.601]  And they've trained them that everything they pump into your body is for your own good.
[00:17:51.862 --> 00:17:53.002]  Well, it's like your dog!
[00:17:53.203 --> 00:17:57.486]  You're lovingly coming over and getting your lap, and the government just injects cyanide in.
[00:17:57.506 --> 00:17:59.668]  I mean, it's so sick!
[00:18:00.228 --> 00:18:00.849]  Please continue.
[00:18:01.409 --> 00:18:08.615]  Yes, and once again, these inoculations literally have targeted the immune system of people.
[00:18:09.055 --> 00:18:12.738]  There's hardly a person in the Western world with an intact immune system.
[00:18:13.919 --> 00:18:15.280]  I thought about this years ago when
[00:18:16.321 --> 00:18:21.644]  I've looked at the fads that the medical sciences have gone through, and they do go through these strange fads.
[00:18:22.424 --> 00:18:33.430]  And back in the 50s, at the same time as all this was mandated to go into effect with the food and so on, they also started tonsillectomies and removing adenoids.
[00:18:33.971 --> 00:18:43.916]  As a matter of course, with all children in Europe around the age of four or five, it was the done thing to do, and every mother brought in their child and they'd become their adenoids and their tonsils.
[00:18:44.269 --> 00:18:45.910]  That's your first line of defense.
[00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:48.052]  They are parts of your immune system.
[00:18:48.112 --> 00:18:49.593]  They create white blood cells.
[00:18:50.334 --> 00:18:52.495]  So once they're removed, you're already missing 30% of them.
[00:18:52.556 --> 00:19:01.402]  You're being set up so that ordinary little colds or flus or things which you could normally fight off could actually kill you.
[00:19:02.383 --> 00:19:05.105]  And that was the intent of attacking the immune system.
[00:19:05.325 --> 00:19:06.867]  And they did studies in the 40s.
[00:19:06.907 --> 00:19:09.609]  They knew that antibiotics were going to create superbacteria.
[00:19:11.191 --> 00:19:23.799]  And not only that, what really staggers the mind, too, I call this the Matrix, because you swallow the world that's been presented to you, and everything in it is pretty well false, or a deception, or a cover.
[00:19:24.599 --> 00:19:32.864]  Now, again, the CBC in Canada did an incredible documentary a few years ago called Phagocytes.
[00:19:33.524 --> 00:19:37.807]  Now, phagocytes are viruses which are man-made.
[00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:45.614]  Which can attack and destroy other viruses, any other viruses programmed, literally programmed to destroy, or bacterium.
[00:19:46.375 --> 00:20:04.945]  And the Russians, the Soviet system, were using them from 1917 onwards, and all through the period up until the 90s, the mid-90s, the West weren't... They knew about this, of course, intelligence agencies, they knew about this in the military-industrial complex, but we were told there's nothing but antibiotics.
[00:20:05.045 --> 00:20:07.767]  Meanwhile, children can go into a clinic in Russia,
[00:20:08.243 --> 00:20:16.228]  With pneumonia, they get a little puffer, inhalants, they have a couple of breaths of this, they go home, and they're cured the following day.
[00:20:16.668 --> 00:20:23.532]  Because special viruses can be programmed like computers from 1917, and they did not need antibiotics in Russia.
[00:20:24.112 --> 00:20:31.717]  Now, a company in New York bought over all of the rights of this particular Georgian company, in the ex-Soviet Union,
[00:20:32.384 --> 00:20:33.825]  And they've kept it quiet.
[00:20:33.845 --> 00:20:36.887]  They're only using it for one thing only, and I don't trust them here.
[00:20:37.407 --> 00:20:39.849]  They're using it in all cold-cut meats now.
[00:20:40.489 --> 00:20:46.673]  They put these phagocytes, viruses, on the cold-cut meats, supposedly to kill off other viruses.
[00:20:46.693 --> 00:20:50.615]  That's right, in Latin it means bacteria eater.
[00:20:51.536 --> 00:21:01.002]  And the bigger problem with the cold cuts in the meats, they're spraying with it, is it allows them to take rotten meat covered in feces from the slaughterhouse, literally folks,
[00:21:01.542 --> 00:21:04.064]  That's right, and now we have outbreaks of Listeria
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.321]  On Cold Beach, suddenly.
[00:21:31.341 --> 00:21:32.722]  That didn't happen before.
[00:21:35.543 --> 00:21:37.284]  And so their answer is, radiated.
[00:21:37.985 --> 00:21:40.787]  But you're still eating the toxin.
[00:21:40.987 --> 00:21:43.908]  What gets you really sick is the bacteria excrement.
[00:21:44.269 --> 00:21:50.352]  We'll be right back with Alan Watt and your calls.
[00:21:51.273 --> 00:21:52.173]  We're on the march.
[00:21:52.674 --> 00:21:54.255]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:55.195 --> 00:21:57.877]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:05.733]  Don't be a victim of sudden cardiac arrest due to inflammation of the arterial walls.
[00:22:06.094 --> 00:22:12.438]  Our hemp foods are anti-inflammatory and gluten-free, and can greatly benefit the health of the human body.
[00:22:13.178 --> 00:22:21.544]  By calling 908-691-2608 or visiting hempusa.org, you can benefit from this wonderful natural food source.
[00:22:22.205 --> 00:22:29.610]  Our customers are also purchasing this natural food for long-term storage, camping, survival and emergency food rations.
[00:22:30.134 --> 00:22:35.636]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit hempusa.org today.
[00:22:35.656 --> 00:22:43.599]  Hempusa.org believes that now is the time to plan for the future and food will be your greatest asset.
[00:22:44.219 --> 00:22:51.001]  People spend money on all kinds of things, but our warning is prepare now for food shortages in the future.
[00:22:51.843 --> 00:23:00.507]  So don't delay, call today, 908-691-2608, and see what our powder, seeds, and oil can do for you.
[00:23:00.527 --> 00:23:03.149]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:23:03.169 --> 00:23:05.690]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:08.311]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:23:08.331 --> 00:23:09.492]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:23:09.512 --> 00:23:11.152]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:23:11.232 --> 00:23:17.736]  How do the American people know that 9-11 wasn't staged, wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:23:27.411 --> 00:23:32.307]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:23:36.056 --> 00:23:37.136]  How dare you?
[00:23:37.317 --> 00:23:43.559]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:23:43.579 --> 00:23:46.200]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:52.882]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[00:23:52.922 --> 00:23:55.503]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[00:23:55.783 --> 00:23:57.784]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.

[00:24:49.604 --> 00:24:52.807]  Free yourself from expensive cable and satellite fees.
[00:24:53.207 --> 00:24:54.307]  All right, going back to Alan Watt.
[00:25:25.433 --> 00:25:40.896]  Going back to Alan Watt and your phone calls here in just a moment.
[00:25:43.436 --> 00:25:47.257]  But before I do that I want to tell you about a couple sponsors that make this radio show possible.
[00:25:47.277 --> 00:25:50.437]  One great sponsor
[00:25:54.608 --> 00:25:56.229]  is Interhealth Botanicals.
[00:25:56.669 --> 00:25:58.250]  You know them as Interfood.
[00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:01.512]  That's just one of their great line of products.
[00:26:04.093 --> 00:26:10.237]  Interfood, folks, is the best green food out there, bar none.
[00:26:11.909 --> 00:26:25.423]  And I hope that you will check out the web banners that we have for them up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com because they have a whole line of great products, but they're green food.
[00:26:25.563 --> 00:26:30.688]  I've taken other ones that have all these superfoods and ingredients and they always give me headache or make me feel sped up.
[00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:40.633]  It's just a whole bunch of well-known superfoods that are really good for your body.
[00:26:41.233 --> 00:26:49.316]  So again, check it out at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:26:51.457 --> 00:26:54.077]  You can link through there to the InnerFood website.
[00:26:54.117 --> 00:26:56.778]  Find the banner right there on both sites.
[00:26:58.019 --> 00:27:00.400]  Also, there is Food Shortage USA.
[00:27:01.786 --> 00:27:05.207]  FoodShortageUSA.com is the website.
[00:27:06.468 --> 00:27:12.250]  Phase one of the insiders plan for a one world government has been indicated with the recent bailout.
[00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:19.212]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new world bank to act as savior.
[00:27:19.672 --> 00:27:20.612]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[00:27:20.633 --> 00:27:24.434]  The insiders have discovered that they can control two things to seize total control and power.
[00:27:25.154 --> 00:27:28.575]  One is the world currency, which they are currently being prepared to accept, and the other is food.
[00:27:29.095 --> 00:27:31.776]  We're witnessing the engineered financial crisis, folks.
[00:27:32.096 --> 00:27:33.356]  Don't wait until it's too late.
[00:27:33.757 --> 00:27:40.479]  Go to FoodShortageUSA.com to learn how to make your own storable foods for you and your family, prepare for the road ahead.
[00:27:40.859 --> 00:27:45.200]  This website reveals a step-by-step way for the average person to get prepared for what's ahead.
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:50.483]  I think the best part about the system is it gets you off the food grid, even if you don't have a lot of money to spend.
[00:27:50.523 --> 00:27:53.085]  The site is foodshortageusa.com.
[00:27:53.185 --> 00:27:53.585]  One word.
[00:27:54.046 --> 00:27:57.528]  Or 877-327-0365 to learn more.
[00:27:57.548 --> 00:28:01.291]  877-327-0365.
[00:28:03.272 --> 00:28:11.277]  Alan, I said I was particularly having you on today, and we appreciate your time, to take calls so we can go in different directions than you or I would normally focus on.
[00:28:13.012 --> 00:28:21.715]  You know, pretty much on the same page with you and your research, because we just go to their own source documents with the chemical dumbing down, the biological attacks, what they're setting up.
[00:28:22.335 --> 00:28:29.398]  But I want to go to the calls, and we've been interrupted by a few breaks and my seconding everything you're saying, but you know, I can't help myself.
[00:28:29.438 --> 00:28:30.298]  It's all so accurate.
[00:28:30.338 --> 00:28:32.599]  I want listeners to know this isn't a joke.
[00:28:32.679 --> 00:28:34.900]  This is earth-shatteringly important.
[00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:37.921]  But encapsulating it, and then I want to go to calls.
[00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:42.882]  Again, you're trying to give people the facts, like you always do.
[00:28:42.922 --> 00:28:43.662]  I do the same thing.
[00:28:44.523 --> 00:28:59.753]  But going from the up-close view to the wider view, just in a general gestalt, what their time frame is, what the world's going to look like, what their endgame is, Alan Watt from CuttingThroughTheMatrix.com.
[00:29:00.753 --> 00:29:08.819]  Yeah, they want to manage the takedown of society, and at the same time, they want a unified world to come out of it at the very end.
[00:29:09.542 --> 00:29:11.763]  With the survivors.
[00:29:11.863 --> 00:29:22.527]  With a new system, a standardized world system, where they can literally replace all the old types with better, enhanced, genetically enhanced types that'll serve the elite better.
[00:29:22.788 --> 00:29:26.449]  Now, we know that the elite themselves are not going to dumb themselves down.
[00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:31.691]  Charles Galton Darwin was very explicit about that in his writings, so was Arthur Kessler.
[00:29:32.212 --> 00:29:37.974]  He said, we, the elite, must retain our survival capabilities because we will be guiding planet Earth.
[00:29:38.482 --> 00:29:43.545]  But the rest of the people will not need theirs because the state will be making all the decisions for them.
[00:29:44.446 --> 00:29:46.767]  So that's what they want to come out at the very, very end.
[00:29:46.827 --> 00:29:53.971]  A placid, compliant, genetically enhanced, more productive species, but a far reduced, more efficient population.
[00:29:54.752 --> 00:30:01.776]  And when you tie that in with the Department of Defense's think tank study for NATO, which was echoed by the U.S.
[00:30:01.816 --> 00:30:03.457]  military's one, it's quite identical.
[00:30:03.877 --> 00:30:06.259]  They see nothing but riots starting around 2010, 2012.
[00:30:08.772 --> 00:30:14.474]  To do with food and various other things, necessities really, and escalating for 30 years.
[00:30:14.554 --> 00:30:22.976]  Now that ties in with the timelines that the United Nations has talked about for their new global society with the reduced population.
[00:30:23.296 --> 00:30:28.618]  They say in their own documents now there'll be a vastly reduced population by the year 2030, 2035.
[00:30:30.958 --> 00:30:36.720]  So we're looking at a long-term business plan that's going to reduce population
[00:30:37.527 --> 00:30:42.795]  During that time, they will be putting big money into genetic enhancing of specific people.
[00:30:43.533 --> 00:30:45.094]  To serve them better new strains.
[00:30:45.575 --> 00:30:49.318]  And at the end, as the old man dies off, they'll bring in the new type.
[00:30:49.758 --> 00:30:52.861]  In fact, the old man will be unable to even procreate and reproduce.
[00:30:53.401 --> 00:30:54.562]  So they'll bring in the new type.
[00:30:54.622 --> 00:30:57.224]  And this will be the reason for bringing in the new type.
[00:30:57.745 --> 00:30:58.906]  Well, we've all gone sterile.
[00:30:58.966 --> 00:30:59.806]  We have to do it.
[00:31:00.367 --> 00:31:01.348]  And no one will complain.
[00:31:01.408 --> 00:31:02.489]  No one will object.
[00:31:02.929 --> 00:31:06.552]  They'll think it's just a necessity and a strange thing in nature.
[00:31:07.052 --> 00:31:10.075]  That's how... See, most people don't think on a conscious level.
[00:31:10.375 --> 00:31:12.317]  They're in a state of almost perpetual
[00:31:12.955 --> 00:31:13.596]  Hypnosis.
[00:31:14.378 --> 00:31:22.512]  And this has been done by scientific indoctrination from birth, plus the masses of entertainment they take in.
[00:31:22.532 --> 00:31:24.175]  They cannot tell fact from fiction.
[00:31:24.435 --> 00:31:25.958]  They have no reasoning abilities.
[00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:31.673]  And they do expect, like Brzezinski says, they expect the media to do the reasoning for them.
[00:31:31.993 --> 00:31:34.554]  And unfortunately for most folk, that has happened.
[00:31:34.835 --> 00:31:37.436]  And that's why we see all the pre-programming.
[00:31:37.456 --> 00:31:50.243]  I mean, the Pentagon back in 2000, as you know, said, we'll use Hollywood, we'll use movies, we'll use security, we'll use the call for Alzheimer's patients, we will use the fad-driven PR.
[00:31:51.804 --> 00:31:58.710]  Peer pressure system, public relations system, to sell the public on taking microchips.
[00:31:59.511 --> 00:32:12.222]  And they talk in all these government white papers and documents, I covered one on Sunday, I think I'm going to play that clip later, Dr. Kaufman talking about it, from the document, about how most people don't even have their own thoughts, how we're pathetic slaves.
[00:32:13.743 --> 00:32:15.244]  I mean, they're really doing this to you.
[00:32:16.405 --> 00:32:21.347]  I just feel so sorry for the yuppies and people who are so arrogant and so into themselves being powerful.
[00:32:21.647 --> 00:32:33.151]  They've been trained to laugh at us, and then they wonder why their son, you know, is sterile, or why they are sterile, or why they're so unhappy, or why their wife has breast cancer at 40.
[00:32:33.691 --> 00:32:37.812]  And it's all engineered, and they just sit there dying, still loving the lie.
[00:32:38.833 --> 00:32:39.713]  They do, they do.
[00:32:39.733 --> 00:32:45.375]  The trick was, and it's been written about too, is to make a generation believe
[00:32:46.021 --> 00:32:46.662]  That's good to hear.
[00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:00.771]  Everything that we've been told.
[00:33:00.971 --> 00:33:06.594]  An arrogance, a haughtiness, a self-false satisfiedness that they're members of the elite.
[00:33:06.614 --> 00:33:07.755]  I mean, here's a microcosm.
[00:33:08.135 --> 00:33:11.697]  There have been tens of thousands of urban warfare drills the last 25 years.
[00:33:12.118 --> 00:33:13.358]  I mean, they have thousands a year.
[00:33:13.899 --> 00:33:18.361]  So, I mean, it's got to be tens of thousands, more than tens of thousands, probably hundreds of thousands.
[00:33:18.842 --> 00:33:23.925]  And they always tell the town or city, even though they may have been there 15 times over the years,
[00:33:24.565 --> 00:33:26.307]  You are the first city to have this drill.
[00:33:26.427 --> 00:33:27.248]  You are special.
[00:33:27.588 --> 00:33:31.271]  You are the first city to have us tax you to drive your car with transponders.
[00:33:31.592 --> 00:33:32.452]  You are the first.
[00:33:32.533 --> 00:33:35.375]  And I always see that and go, but they're not the first.
[00:33:35.395 --> 00:33:38.018]  But again, it's part of that, oh my God, I'm part of the first.
[00:33:38.458 --> 00:33:39.239]  I'm cutting edge.
[00:33:39.299 --> 00:33:40.240]  I'm a trailblazer.
[00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:41.161]  Go ahead, please.
[00:33:42.174 --> 00:33:47.856]  Exactly, that that is how it's done, and they truly believe that the most advanced species has ever existed.
[00:33:48.536 --> 00:33:51.958]  That's exactly what Bertrand Russell and others said in the 50s.
[00:33:52.078 --> 00:34:03.001]  They said, we shall create an egocentronic society, a hedonistic society, where they'll live for themselves and think they know it all, and they will be the willing fools for our strategy.
[00:34:03.302 --> 00:34:04.242]  Well, that's happened.
[00:34:06.192 --> 00:34:12.197]  And you can take them to the documents, the published works, government policy, and they will just laugh at you.
[00:34:12.498 --> 00:34:16.641]  They'll get this pre-programmed little smile and go, haha, sure.
[00:34:18.062 --> 00:34:18.823]  Man, I tell you.
[00:34:19.183 --> 00:34:21.265]  And now they're openly announcing world government, Alan.
[00:34:21.445 --> 00:34:24.588]  They're now openly announcing the banks are going to run it all, carbon taxes.
[00:34:25.209 --> 00:34:29.973]  And still, people email me and post on InfoWars.com and PrisonPilot.com in the comments,
[00:34:31.448 --> 00:34:35.429]  They say, oh, they're announcing world government, but that's different than the one you're talking about.
[00:34:36.329 --> 00:34:38.170]  Governance isn't government.
[00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:41.511]  It says Lord Rothschild called last week for governance.
[00:34:41.871 --> 00:34:44.951]  Well, governance is, in the definitions, government, the system of government.
[00:34:45.852 --> 00:34:47.352]  So global system of government.
[00:34:48.092 --> 00:34:53.234]  And then they say, okay, they're calling for a new world order, but that just means a new system.
[00:34:53.514 --> 00:34:57.915]  And I go, but we told you specifically it would be by the bankers that they would create the collapse.
[00:34:57.935 --> 00:34:58.855]  We had their documents.
[00:34:59.155 --> 00:34:59.795]  Most of them you can't.
[00:34:59.815 --> 00:35:03.297]  I've even had people, yuppies, who say that they do want librarianship.
[00:35:17.802 --> 00:35:23.644]  And the big benefactors at the top that designed it, designed it to help them and to make them happy.
[00:35:23.824 --> 00:35:24.785]  Do you really believe this?
[00:35:24.945 --> 00:35:26.125]  I've had them tell me that, too.
[00:35:27.005 --> 00:35:35.248]  And I say to them, I say, well, don't forget there are going to be central computers to program that chip, which means you're not going to be in control of your own mind anymore.
[00:35:35.268 --> 00:35:36.789]  And they're just laughing.
[00:35:36.809 --> 00:35:37.809]  Yeah.
[00:35:38.189 --> 00:35:38.389]  Yeah.
[00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:42.811]  So they're a lost cause.
[00:35:43.618 --> 00:35:46.600]  Well, the good news is there are more people than ever that do want to hear, that do want to know.
[00:36:09.031 --> 00:36:19.352]  And it's so three-dimensional and even four-dimensional, how it's all interlocked, and after decades of study you can get a map of it in your own mind, you can articulate it, but still...
[00:36:21.134 --> 00:36:23.756]  It's so hard to articulate the subtleties to people.
[00:36:23.796 --> 00:36:27.839]  The globalists in their own documents articulate it and try to articulate it.
[00:36:28.619 --> 00:36:39.246]  And because the public can't see it as one-dimensional or two-dimensional, they'll just throw it out of hand saying, that's too complicated for anyone to run, when it is being run and they say they're running it.
[00:36:40.247 --> 00:36:43.709]  They say, and that's the key to the term they're using of governance.
[00:36:44.409 --> 00:36:50.093]  You see, the new system that's already here, it's been here for a long time, is a system
[00:36:50.865 --> 00:36:53.787]  That to the public appears to be something called democracy.
[00:36:54.268 --> 00:37:04.796]  In reality, you have a parallel government run by foundations, which in turn are a front for the ancient establishment, the very wealthy rich establishment.
[00:37:05.277 --> 00:37:10.301]  They fund the non-governmental organizations that appear to speak on behalf of the public.
[00:37:11.161 --> 00:37:15.185]  In reality, they're speaking on behalf of the very foundations that fund them.
[00:37:15.865 --> 00:37:18.027]  That's the new type of governance they're talking about.
[00:37:18.087 --> 00:37:19.388]  It is the Soviet system.
[00:37:20.171 --> 00:37:30.303]  The Soviet means rule by councils, and in the Soviet Union they had NGO groups with their leaders appointed from the Politburo.
[00:37:31.064 --> 00:37:34.548]  We have the exact same system here as they merged the two systems together.
[00:37:35.449 --> 00:37:39.954]  That came out from the Ford Foundation during the Rees Commission.
[00:37:40.891 --> 00:37:40.991]  I'm
[00:38:02.665 --> 00:38:02.865]  That's
[00:38:19.108 --> 00:38:20.509]  And they call them stakeholders.
[00:38:20.569 --> 00:38:31.493]  The individual has no voice, but all these subgroups who then have heads, who are globalists, who speak for them and really control them, they are stakeholders.
[00:38:31.994 --> 00:38:36.375]  And we see all this nomenclature now coming in and replacing everything.
[00:38:39.277 --> 00:38:42.038]  Alan, I want to go to calls here, but just in closing before we do that,
[00:38:43.717 --> 00:38:49.741]  The official UN documents, as you know, and government documents say they want to reduce this by 80%.
[00:38:51.742 --> 00:39:02.350]  And everything we've seen up until now is just testing the soft kill weapons, testing how to sell to the public, how to not have the public notice that people are dying all around them, how to try to cook the numbers and spin things.
[00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:14.815]  But we know there's been hot kill going on in Iraq, hot kill in Serbia, Afghanistan, Africa, Latin America, where large portions of populations are being killed, 10, 20, 30, 40% in some cases.
[00:39:15.656 --> 00:39:22.339]  The hot killing, the fast killing in the West, when are they going to start launching those?
[00:39:24.151 --> 00:39:28.775]  I think fairly shortly they have big plans to standardize the world quickly.
[00:39:29.095 --> 00:39:51.251]  What they're doing, and that's exactly what they're doing, they're eradicating all older cultures that haven't gone along and accepted this very vague term of democracy, and they haven't accepted World Bank running their system, they haven't accepted basically the British-style parliamentary system, because this whole world system was born in London, England,
[00:39:52.385 --> 00:39:53.246]  It's from the 1500s.
[00:39:54.207 --> 00:39:57.950]  John Dee wrote about the creation of a world empire based on the British system.
[00:39:58.731 --> 00:40:04.296]  And it's now come out that the Crown, MI5 and MI6, run the whole Parliament, spy on it.
[00:40:04.556 --> 00:40:07.019]  They kill any member or set them up that gets out of line.
[00:40:07.299 --> 00:40:09.841]  It is totally ceremonial, just like the Congress.
[00:40:10.742 --> 00:40:17.428]  Yes, and after World War II, there were big talks at the United Nations and wanted to set it up.
[00:40:18.004 --> 00:40:24.493]  That those colonial countries would not be pulled out of by Britain until they had set up in those countries.
[00:40:25.314 --> 00:40:30.878]  a mini British type system of government and then they could pull it out and withdraw it.
[00:40:30.938 --> 00:40:39.683]  And they wrote hundreds of books from Quigley's to others bragging about the system but you go to Wikipedia or to the mainline Encyclopedia Britannica and they say the New World Order doesn't exist!
[00:40:39.984 --> 00:40:47.969]  Does it matter if it's taught at Princeton and Harvard and Oxford and they admit the system of world governance through the shadow roundtables?
[00:40:48.469 --> 00:40:50.791]  They will just still laugh at us and say it doesn't exist!
[00:40:51.711 --> 00:41:08.038]  That's right, even though the historian for the Council on Foreign Relations, which is part of the Parliament, Carol Quigley himself, wrote his big book on it, The Anglo-American Establishment and Tragedy and Hope, and he outlines them there, their whole agenda.
[00:41:08.358 --> 00:41:09.479]  It was quite fascinating.
[00:41:11.192 --> 00:41:11.912]  Yeah, that's a great book.
[00:41:11.952 --> 00:41:16.274]  I read that back when I was about 15, and I had no idea what I was reading was the keys to how it all worked.
[00:41:16.314 --> 00:41:17.834]  And this is the government commissioning.
[00:41:17.854 --> 00:41:20.695]  Because, you know, the people in government really have to know how it works.
[00:41:20.755 --> 00:41:21.535]  These are the slaves.
[00:41:21.575 --> 00:41:22.816]  We're poisoning them.
[00:41:22.836 --> 00:41:23.996]  We're going to get rid of them, okay?
[00:41:24.036 --> 00:41:27.457]  And if you work with us, you'll be allowed to procreate, and we won't kill you.
[00:41:27.497 --> 00:41:27.978]  How's that sound?
[00:41:29.038 --> 00:41:37.821]  Another odd thing, too, was back in the 90s, I don't know if it... I think it's the same in the U.S., but politicians in Canada and the British Commonwealth countries
[00:41:38.735 --> 00:41:45.179]  They made a law to treat the politicians and their families in special military hospitals.
[00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:48.582]  And I thought at the time, well, what's all this about?
[00:41:49.402 --> 00:41:51.563]  Aren't the hospitals that we have good enough for them?
[00:41:52.304 --> 00:41:59.168]  And I realized, too, what it is, is all these coming plagues that are scheduled to come out, they do have treatments for them.
[00:41:59.529 --> 00:42:01.390]  They do have the real antidotes to them.
[00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:07.213]  And I think they've been giving the politicians and the families these particular antidotes.
[00:42:07.553 --> 00:42:09.274]  Well that's actually already come out.
[00:42:09.935 --> 00:42:15.978]  They get all the cancer cures, they get it all, and this is so diabolical.
[00:42:16.478 --> 00:42:25.524]  And that's why they go along with these politicians and they will keep their mouths shut, they will play the game because they're getting all these benefits and a fairly good guarantee they will live.
[00:42:28.624 --> 00:42:34.668]  Ultra-vicious, ultra-wicked, ultra-selfish, and a lot of you listening will continue to laugh.
[00:42:35.529 --> 00:42:43.955]  But, God forbid, as you're burying your children, your wife, your husband, from what your masters are going to do to you, maybe then you'll fight back.
[00:42:44.355 --> 00:42:56.044]  Then you'll be facing the drone aircraft, and the swords, and the brainwashed chipped troops, but we can still get into their deep underground bases, even after this happens, and probably beat them.
[00:42:57.076 --> 00:42:57.917]  But we'll see.
[00:42:58.277 --> 00:42:58.938]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:58.958 --> 00:42:59.358]  Stay with us.
[00:43:00.599 --> 00:43:01.440]  Let's skip this break.
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:02.941]  I'm going to keep rolling.
[00:43:03.902 --> 00:43:05.203]  I'm going to go ahead and skip this break.
[00:43:05.243 --> 00:43:05.403]  Why?
[00:43:05.443 --> 00:43:05.963]  What's going on?
[00:43:06.003 --> 00:43:06.584]  Hold on a second.
[00:43:06.604 --> 00:43:14.490]  Something behind the scenes.
[00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:23.137]  I got the Trachems in here laughing with the local TV producers.
[00:43:23.157 --> 00:43:25.539]  They want me to do some 9-11 hit piece and I'm not going on it.
[00:43:25.639 --> 00:43:26.600]  Now they're all upset about it.
[00:43:27.517 --> 00:43:29.079]  I mean, we can waste our time all day.
[00:43:29.719 --> 00:43:30.080]  Do what?
[00:43:32.543 --> 00:43:33.564]  I can't understand you, man.
[00:43:34.985 --> 00:43:35.506]  Ah, whatever.
[00:43:36.327 --> 00:43:37.428]  Anyways, craziness here.
[00:43:37.548 --> 00:43:44.936]  Alan, we're still on the internet right now streaming, but we're going to come back to the whole full audience in about two minutes, and then we'll start taking calls, okay?
[00:43:45.517 --> 00:43:45.677]  Yeah.
[00:43:46.237 --> 00:43:46.758]  Thanks a lot.
[00:43:46.878 --> 00:43:47.419]  We'll be right back.
[00:43:49.756 --> 00:43:51.477]  Drying123.com.
[00:43:51.758 --> 00:43:54.240]  That's D-R-Y-I-N-G-123.com.
[00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:59.944]  Excalibur Dehydrator wishes you and yours health and wellness for the new year.
[00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:11.450]  But who is the enemy?
[00:44:11.971 --> 00:44:12.491]  Bin Laden.
[00:44:12.751 --> 00:44:13.631]  This is his ammo.
[00:44:13.671 --> 00:44:15.072]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:44:15.112 --> 00:44:16.793]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:44:17.133 --> 00:44:23.876]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:44:24.276 --> 00:44:24.716]  Some U.S.
[00:44:24.756 --> 00:44:30.439]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:44:31.119 --> 00:44:34.562]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:44:34.582 --> 00:44:36.603]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.

[00:46:15.284 --> 00:46:20.808]  We're going to Don in Costa Rica, Jimmy, Dustin, Donna, Rico, Dustin, Jeremy and others.
[00:46:21.308 --> 00:46:23.370]  You know, I've done a lot of hit pieces.
[00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:30.295]  I've gone on a lot of national TV shows where they tape you for days or hours and then cut up what you said.
[00:46:30.315 --> 00:46:34.919]  They never let you put out your real evidence of a 9-11 minute inside job or the New World Order.
[00:46:37.387 --> 00:46:40.129]  And, you know, the key is the mainstream media has lost all their credibility.
[00:46:40.149 --> 00:46:42.171]  They've been caught putting out their disinfo forever.
[00:46:42.791 --> 00:46:47.855]  And, you know, I said I'd do this first History Channel thing and others, and I did them.
[00:46:48.675 --> 00:46:53.359]  I mean, it's a stacked deck, but this newest one, Alan, was
[00:46:55.310 --> 00:47:05.333]  A guy that specializes in hit pieces on JFK researchers and others, and really puts out ridiculous pieces, where it's not even based in reality.
[00:47:06.173 --> 00:47:07.594]  The very foundations of it aren't.
[00:47:08.954 --> 00:47:12.235]  And he's doing a big piece for National Geographic.
[00:47:12.995 --> 00:47:14.796]  And I said, you know what, I don't think I'm going to do that interview.
[00:47:14.856 --> 00:47:16.016]  No, I'm not going to be interviewed by it.
[00:47:16.196 --> 00:47:23.118]  And they just can't believe that I don't care about going on their national TV show, so that I can have them stack the deck.
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:55.736]  It's true, it's interesting as well to recognize that Professor Carroll Quigley himself mentioned that that was a technique they used in mainstream media because they often called on him to bring on with a guest who was coming out with a theory of the world being manipulated and they'd bring him on to try and repudiate the guest.
[00:47:56.417 --> 00:48:02.899]  So that was part of his function, and he admits that in his own book, that they try and stack the deck and make the person look ridiculous.
[00:48:02.919 --> 00:48:12.302]  You gotta go on TV, here he is, government historian, who's writing a book for the government, laughing at how he would go lie to the American people and say this didn't exist.
[00:48:12.703 --> 00:48:15.944]  I mean, how do they get these guys to do this against their fellow man?
[00:48:17.544 --> 00:48:20.405]  Many people out there are so easily bribed.
[00:48:21.185 --> 00:48:21.966]  Ego status,
[00:48:23.974 --> 00:48:24.614]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:48:35.846 --> 00:48:37.707]  Which we call integrity.
[00:48:37.727 --> 00:48:39.207]  They can't understand that at all.
[00:48:39.628 --> 00:48:43.069]  It's a foreign... They actually go into a stunned look when you say it.
[00:48:43.089 --> 00:48:49.451]  Well, I mean, they've killed 3 million Iraqis in the last 18 years.
[00:48:49.471 --> 00:48:50.632]  I mean, I don't want to be part of that.
[00:48:50.692 --> 00:48:51.872]  I mean, killing little kids?
[00:48:52.593 --> 00:48:53.993]  Yes, and to them that's nothing.
[00:48:54.053 --> 00:48:55.054]  That's nothing at all.
[00:48:55.714 --> 00:48:56.434]  They sleep well.
[00:48:56.454 --> 00:48:57.455]  They plan this kind of thing.
[00:48:57.475 --> 00:48:58.575]  They don't need sleeping pills.
[00:48:59.164 --> 00:49:03.628]  They are psychopathic types, and we really cannot relate to them.
[00:49:03.848 --> 00:49:11.654]  They're so far removed as a species in psychopathy, and so inbred that it is guaranteed to pass on to their offspring.
[00:49:11.674 --> 00:49:18.540]  All right, let's talk about that term later, but right now let's go to Don in Costa Rica, and then we'll hold him over.
[00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:20.582]  Don, thanks for holding her on the air with Alan Watt.
[00:49:21.624 --> 00:49:22.385]  Hola, Alex.
[00:49:22.485 --> 00:49:28.230]  Yeah, I'm calling from an IP phone in Costa Rica, a first-time caller, former Californian.
[00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:29.231]  Can you hear me okay?
[00:49:29.331 --> 00:49:29.732]  Yes, sir.
[00:49:31.013 --> 00:49:31.393]  Okay.
[00:49:31.974 --> 00:49:46.547]  I just wanted to talk a little bit about global warming and supposedly it's caused CO2, which a lot of people call greenhouse gas, but if you want to find some information on it,
[00:49:47.527 --> 00:49:52.130]  You could better find it by looking up industrial gases on the internet.
[00:49:53.511 --> 00:49:57.813]  And you'll find all the uses that industry uses CO2 for.
[00:49:57.833 --> 00:50:07.039]  So my plan to stop all talk of global warming would be simply just to outlaw the sale of CO2.
[00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:15.224]  And when you do that, the first people to raise a stink about it would be the soft drink industry.
[00:50:16.810 --> 00:50:18.531]  And also, maybe they're consumers.
[00:50:18.571 --> 00:50:19.811]  Yeah, well they're not going to do that.
[00:50:19.831 --> 00:50:20.852]  They're going to tax it.
[00:50:21.212 --> 00:50:26.394]  They know it's based on all manufacturing, life on this planet, you know, a key.
[00:50:26.814 --> 00:50:31.036]  It's sunlight, water, oxygen, carbon dioxide, makes the world go round.
[00:50:31.956 --> 00:50:32.336]  Stay there.
[00:50:32.356 --> 00:50:34.297]  We'll get Alan Watts' take on this when we get back.
[00:50:34.337 --> 00:50:37.098]  Yeah, the global feudalism tax.
[00:50:37.178 --> 00:50:37.598]  Stay with us.
[00:50:37.618 --> 00:50:43.781]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:51:56.050 --> 00:51:58.832]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:52:22.247 --> 00:52:23.027]  All right, Don.
[00:52:24.007 --> 00:52:30.629]  Yes, CO2 is just used in almost every type of manufacturing imaginable.
[00:52:30.709 --> 00:52:31.449]  Soft drinks.
[00:52:33.169 --> 00:52:34.550]  The oceans are filled with it.
[00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:36.390]  The atmosphere is where the plants breathe.
[00:52:37.170 --> 00:52:39.331]  But it's the perfect thing to restrict
[00:52:40.205 --> 00:52:52.535]  It's what humans exhale, and as the Club of Rome said, Richard N. Haas had the CFR writing for them, he said it's about making humans the enemy, and the state is the solution to deal with the enemy.
[00:52:54.016 --> 00:52:55.478]  So it's about making us bad.
[00:52:55.538 --> 00:52:56.038]  Alan Watt?
[00:52:57.239 --> 00:53:04.765]  Yes, that's in the book The First Global Revolution, and that's put out by the Club of Rome, and they said that back in the 70s,
[00:53:05.871 --> 00:53:19.036]  They were looking at a way to unite the planet and allow the public to be dominated, to allow themselves to be dominated, and they said that they hit upon the idea of making man the enemy of an environment, and could say that global warming was caused by man.
[00:53:19.056 --> 00:53:20.857]  They said that would fit the bill.
[00:53:21.017 --> 00:53:21.957]  That excuse would fit the bill.
[00:53:21.978 --> 00:53:22.658]  Yeah, that's a quote.
[00:53:22.738 --> 00:53:24.378]  Now, now, now, this is published publicly.
[00:53:24.418 --> 00:53:26.199]  Now, think about this, listeners.
[00:53:26.879 --> 00:53:35.063]  Openly saying it's fake, and openly saying they want a global state waging war against the individual and exterminating us.
[00:53:36.229 --> 00:53:37.650]  These are not nice people, Alan.
[00:53:38.071 --> 00:53:39.171]  Any comments on that, Don?
[00:53:39.191 --> 00:53:52.122]  What we know too is that the Club of Rome is not just a think tank, it's the premier think tank that creates strategy for the future and hands it to governments to put into policy.
[00:53:52.622 --> 00:54:00.665]  Meanwhile you have all these well-meaning liberals and mainline people and having global warming parties and getting involved in knifing tires of SUVs.
[00:54:01.105 --> 00:54:03.406]  I'm proving, oh, I'm so loving.
[00:54:03.946 --> 00:54:11.688]  And then now Obama openly has announced these youth brigades, three million man environmental squads, one million man domestic spy force.
[00:54:11.929 --> 00:54:13.229]  He says it on TV.
[00:54:13.649 --> 00:54:15.310]  His chief of staff says it.
[00:54:16.030 --> 00:54:16.870]  All of them do it.
[00:54:16.910 --> 00:54:18.731]  He puts it on his website and pulls it off.
[00:54:19.031 --> 00:54:21.772]  And I'm getting hundreds of emails every day, Alan, saying I'm a liar.
[00:54:22.832 --> 00:54:23.973]  Yeah.
[00:54:23.993 --> 00:54:37.463]  And then I was watching PBS Sunday, a show called Fueled, and they had a roundtable on PBS with Robert Kennedy and others saying, we're going to take everybody out of work and have them work for the environment, fighting for the environment.
[00:54:37.723 --> 00:54:49.612]  Can you imagine all these dumbed down fluoride heads, sterilized, running around, literal zombie creatures, coming after us that know what's going on, because the government gives them a little uniform?
[00:54:50.911 --> 00:55:06.839]  That is right, and what the Club of Rome also said about that agenda was that the only time that the public will allow themselves to be completely ruled 100% is during a war scenario, and therefore they'd have to make a war scenario to do with the environment and man against the planet.
[00:55:07.429 --> 00:55:11.790]  And then, they would change all of society by the laws they would then introduce.
[00:55:12.370 --> 00:55:13.731]  So, it's a war scenario.
[00:55:13.991 --> 00:55:16.471]  They're using all the techniques right now, so you're quite right.
[00:55:16.491 --> 00:55:21.473]  A land army was spoken about, the first earth army at NATO, of all places.
[00:55:22.333 --> 00:55:25.374]  Actually, NASA came out with it, and they now have it.
[00:55:25.914 --> 00:55:30.435]  And they mention, let's get more to that after the calls, but they also mention the other part of the pincer.
[00:55:30.495 --> 00:55:33.256]  It says, fake environmentalism, carbon tax.
[00:55:34.176 --> 00:55:34.957]  Terrorism.
[00:55:35.077 --> 00:55:36.398]  Threat of stage terror.
[00:55:36.698 --> 00:55:39.219]  And then like a beetle grabbing a wasp.
[00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:40.260]  He's got you.
[00:55:42.221 --> 00:55:43.002]  Pinscher attack.
[00:55:43.122 --> 00:55:43.743]  Fake terror.
[00:55:43.923 --> 00:55:45.304]  Fake environment.
[00:55:45.424 --> 00:55:45.824]  Gotcha.
[00:55:46.624 --> 00:55:46.765]  Yep.
[00:55:47.425 --> 00:55:47.805]  That's right.
[00:55:47.825 --> 00:55:49.306]  My studio audience likes the analogy.
[00:55:49.727 --> 00:55:57.532]  The indoctrination of children at kindergarten now is terrifying because they're going to grow up to be real staunch environazis.
[00:55:58.628 --> 00:56:01.250]  And you can see it all coming, what's been planned.
[00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:05.272]  They always go for the youngsters to train them for their role when they're adults.
[00:56:05.312 --> 00:56:12.275]  Well, you saw these articles in the New York Times and others where, I'm glad my three-year-old and five-year-old rebuke me for taking a hot bath.
[00:56:12.355 --> 00:56:13.216]  I won't anymore.
[00:56:13.496 --> 00:56:15.157]  I'm glad my children are my bosses.
[00:56:15.357 --> 00:56:24.862]  So reversing roles with mindless five-year-old Nazis, literally in red and black uniforms, climate cops, we're not making it up, just storming around, reporting everyone.
[00:56:24.882 --> 00:56:26.243]  Oh, it's so good.
[00:56:27.245 --> 00:56:29.034]  I mean, how could you make this up, Alan?
[00:56:29.315 --> 00:56:30.240]  It's too insane!
[00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:30.983]  Yeah.
[00:56:31.809 --> 00:56:35.370]  Yeah, and George Orwell had that in his book, and you see it in the movie, too.
[00:56:35.410 --> 00:56:37.110]  The British version was Richard Burton.
[00:56:37.490 --> 00:56:38.851]  Excellent movie.
[00:56:38.891 --> 00:56:39.551]  The spies!
[00:56:40.351 --> 00:56:42.191]  The children have little uniforms on.
[00:56:42.211 --> 00:56:43.752]  They call the adults thought criminals.
[00:56:43.772 --> 00:56:44.772]  They're going to report them.
[00:56:45.192 --> 00:56:46.192]  This is all here.
[00:56:46.352 --> 00:56:50.553]  And the uniform is red and black, just as it is now in England and the U.S.
[00:56:50.873 --> 00:56:52.713]  Red and black uniform, kids running around.
[00:56:53.034 --> 00:56:54.574]  By 15, they give them machine guns.
[00:56:54.934 --> 00:56:56.774]  We're going to skip this break for Internet listeners.
[00:56:56.814 --> 00:56:58.535]  I'm going to let Don finish up in Costa Rica.
[00:56:58.795 --> 00:56:59.415]  Here we go.
[00:57:01.503 --> 00:57:02.784]  Yeah, folks, you can't make it up.
[00:57:02.864 --> 00:57:04.344]  I mean, you can't make it up.
[00:57:04.684 --> 00:57:09.026]  It's in the Philadelphia Daily News, 15-year-olds with M16s training for us.
[00:57:09.826 --> 00:57:10.666]  I mean, we're just screwed.
[00:57:10.686 --> 00:57:20.990]  They're going to turn loose mindless hordes of scum, brain-dead, brainwashed, lazy hamburger eaters, the mainline McDonald's heads, the fluoride heads on us.
[00:57:21.490 --> 00:57:23.811]  Because they'll do anything for money, anything for power.
[00:57:24.271 --> 00:57:26.072]  I just wish I was down in Costa Rica with Don.
[00:57:26.092 --> 00:57:27.072]  Don, finish up your points.
[00:57:27.964 --> 00:57:28.624]  Don dropped off.
[00:57:28.704 --> 00:57:29.464]  Don dropped off?
[00:57:29.524 --> 00:57:30.565]  I wanted to hear from Don!
[00:57:31.145 --> 00:57:33.265]  But he does have a good idea down there in Costa Rica, Don.
[00:57:34.005 --> 00:57:36.426]  Jimmy in Kentucky, fellow thought criminal.
[00:57:36.486 --> 00:57:41.407]  I'm sure your children will be reporting you soon, because it's part of the home of the free, land of the brave.
[00:57:41.827 --> 00:57:43.307]  Go ahead, criminal!
[00:57:44.727 --> 00:57:45.468]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:57:46.048 --> 00:57:50.228]  Oh, I'm just, I'm realizing that freedom is all sorts of secret police and children spying.
[00:57:51.249 --> 00:57:53.949]  Well, uh, today's my first day actually getting through.
[00:57:53.989 --> 00:57:57.590]  I've tried to call before, so instead of asking a question, I would like to
[00:57:58.123 --> 00:57:59.664]  Give some information to maybe help people?
[00:58:01.025 --> 00:58:04.247]  Oh, you have a license to be able to speak and be able to talk?
[00:58:04.907 --> 00:58:08.729]  Government wants you to have a license to be able to speak to fellow slaves!
[00:58:09.309 --> 00:58:09.970]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:11.231]  No, you're all right.
[00:58:11.631 --> 00:58:17.194]  I got a simple physics test for anybody who does not believe that 9-11 was an inside job.
[00:58:18.135 --> 00:58:19.495]  And anybody can do this anywhere.
[00:58:19.615 --> 00:58:22.597]  It's simply just grab a quarter and try to stick it in a nickel slot.
[00:58:23.358 --> 00:58:25.379]  And if you can get that quarter to fit, then I'll believe the
[00:58:26.454 --> 00:58:27.594]  The official version of it.
[00:58:27.754 --> 00:58:30.135]  Outside of that, I can't see a plane going inside the Pentagon.
[00:58:31.415 --> 00:58:36.536]  And, uh, consider me, uh, I don't know, ignorant, but I think that's an easy way to get it across to people.
[00:58:38.656 --> 00:58:40.297]  Just figured I'd try to put that out there.
[00:58:40.317 --> 00:58:46.298]  Uh, and, uh, Ventura, Governor Ventura had used a quote from Denzel Washington.
[00:58:46.318 --> 00:58:49.578]  Uh, talk to me like I'm a six year old so I'll understand.
[00:58:50.238 --> 00:58:50.458]  Yeah.
[00:58:50.899 --> 00:58:53.219]  I have another quote from Denzel Washington that I liked.
[00:58:54.053 --> 00:58:59.035]  And it was in training day and I can't curse, but uh... The craft ain't checkers, it's chest.
[00:59:00.076 --> 00:59:05.659]  And it's pretty simple whenever you start to think that way that they will do whatever they can to win this war.
[00:59:07.059 --> 00:59:08.080]  Well, I mean exactly.
[00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:13.242]  You've got these scientists who come up with plans to dumb us down, sterilize us, poison us.
[00:59:13.543 --> 00:59:18.325]  They're doing it on record and the public just can't believe it because it's so horrible.
[00:59:18.345 --> 00:59:18.945]  Thanks for the call.
[00:59:18.985 --> 00:59:20.146]  Alan Watt comments on that.
[00:59:20.946 --> 00:59:21.967]  That's absolutely true.
[00:59:23.024 --> 00:59:23.604]  You have to.
[00:59:23.684 --> 00:59:27.066]  People suspend their incredulity because they can't imagine it.
[00:59:27.226 --> 00:59:33.509]  And they have been trained that the good shepherd there, the boss man, is really different from themselves.
[00:59:33.569 --> 00:59:34.630]  He's very altruistic.
[00:59:34.690 --> 00:59:35.590]  He's there to help them.
[00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:37.771]  And all the scientific elite are there to help them.
[00:59:38.292 --> 00:59:39.893]  That's how they've been trained to perceive this.
[00:59:40.613 --> 00:59:48.557]  And the trick of the elite is always to convince, you know, the wolf or the shepherd is always to convince the sheep
[00:59:49.096 --> 00:59:52.839]  The interests lay in the same direction as the elite themselves.
[00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:54.781]  That's the con game of it.
[00:59:55.101 --> 00:59:55.942]  That's the trick of it.
[00:59:56.042 --> 01:00:00.886]  Yeah, that's like the slaves saying, we gotta take care of this here plantation.
[01:00:01.787 --> 01:00:03.148]  This here our plantation.
[01:00:03.668 --> 01:00:04.889]  Here we go, we're going live.
[01:00:06.611 --> 01:00:07.652]  Radio Network.
[01:00:10.534 --> 01:00:13.457]  They have trained the public, Alan Watt, as you know, to believe that
[01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:35.630]  What they believe is reality, and that the general public is with the elite, and as you were saying, that the general masses well-being is the same well-being of the elite, or that we're all together, we're all going in the same direction, we all have the same interest.
[01:00:37.382 --> 01:00:48.688]  The public's also been trained not to have respect for themselves and to imagine Hollywood people as like gods who float around on clouds and elitist with eggheads in fancy suits on TV no more than they do.
[01:00:49.549 --> 01:00:57.693]  When in truth, once you really know what's going on, you watch the eggheads, the experts, they're putting out false disinfo on purpose that isn't even meant to make sense.
[01:00:58.334 --> 01:00:58.594]  Alan?
[01:00:59.594 --> 01:01:04.137]  That is true, and with science they can rationalize anything to an ignorant populace.
[01:01:06.206 --> 01:01:07.427]  Let's take more calls here.
[01:01:07.487 --> 01:01:09.688]  Let's talk to Dustin in Ohio.
[01:01:09.788 --> 01:01:12.429]  Dustin, you're on the air with Alan Watt.
[01:01:12.509 --> 01:01:12.889]  Welcome.
[01:01:13.249 --> 01:01:14.110]  Dustin dropped off.
[01:01:14.610 --> 01:01:15.991]  Dustin dropped off.
[01:01:17.291 --> 01:01:18.312]  OK, I see that there.
[01:01:18.752 --> 01:01:20.993]  Donna in New Mexico, you're on the air.
[01:01:21.914 --> 01:01:22.234]  Hello.
[01:01:22.454 --> 01:01:22.754]  Hi.
[01:01:23.454 --> 01:01:24.115]  How are you today?
[01:01:24.315 --> 01:01:24.855]  Fine, thank you.
[01:01:25.695 --> 01:01:26.596]  Hi, Alan, as well.
[01:01:27.536 --> 01:01:30.838]  I'm going to raise a point that never gets raised in terms of the global
[01:01:31.437 --> 01:01:46.080]  Climate change debate, and it's one that really gets under my skin because I've researched it extensively, and that is heating of the ionosphere using electromagnetic energy from projects such as HAARP, one of many.
[01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:48.620]  I think over 60 countries now are heating the ionosphere.
[01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:56.781]  And I don't see how we can even have a discussion about climate change and so forth without including this in this quote-unquote debate.
[01:01:56.801 --> 01:01:58.842]  The debate itself is polarized.
[01:01:59.642 --> 01:02:00.642]  It comes down on two sides.
[01:02:00.973 --> 01:02:04.014]  Those who believe in naturally occurring climate change, that's one side.
[01:02:04.494 --> 01:02:06.374]  And those who believe in the global warming myth.
[01:02:06.414 --> 01:02:07.254]  And it is a myth.
[01:02:07.314 --> 01:02:08.274]  There's no doubt about that.
[01:02:08.314 --> 01:02:10.415]  It takes you about five seconds to figure it out if you look it up.
[01:02:12.295 --> 01:02:23.637]  What we see when we experience this ionosphere heating with electromagnetic energy is severe changes in jet stream, increase in volcanics, increase in earthquakes.
[01:02:24.337 --> 01:02:29.578]  Now, my understanding is that HAARP went operational approximately sometime right before 2004.
[01:02:31.090 --> 01:02:34.812]  And right after that, we had the dramatic earthquake tsunami in Indonesia.
[01:02:34.852 --> 01:02:40.714]  Yeah, let me be specific here, because you're bringing up a really important point that I have made, but not often enough.
[01:02:40.734 --> 01:02:55.121]  In fact, this morning, I was meaning to make this very point, and then you have these thousands of thoughts that never get on air, and then I want you to comment more on it, Donna, and then we'll have Alan comment on it, but it's this.
[01:02:57.382 --> 01:03:05.008]  We know the sun was in a particularly hot phase, putting off more heat radiation in the last 30 years.
[01:03:05.048 --> 01:03:06.689]  Now, the last few, it's cooled down.
[01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:10.873]  The entire solar system is cooling.
[01:03:11.473 --> 01:03:14.416]  The ice caps that were receding on Mars are getting larger.
[01:03:14.456 --> 01:03:16.958]  Same thing for the moons of Saturn and Jupiter and others.
[01:03:18.690 --> 01:03:24.892]  Separately from that, they're getting upset that because of the cooling it's becoming obvious that it's not global warming.
[01:03:24.932 --> 01:03:26.592]  So now they're just saying climate change.
[01:03:27.132 --> 01:03:28.432]  But then that's very childlike.
[01:03:28.732 --> 01:03:29.993]  We're always having climate change.
[01:03:30.013 --> 01:03:30.753]  We have seasons.
[01:03:32.393 --> 01:03:34.094]  We know we go through hot and cold periods.
[01:03:34.174 --> 01:03:35.094]  But you're right.
[01:03:35.854 --> 01:03:42.996]  None of that even matters when it's declassified that they're doing thousands of aerosol spraying operations.
[01:03:43.036 --> 01:03:43.756]  Just Google it.
[01:03:44.116 --> 01:03:46.217]  The government now admits they're... I'm watching one right now.
[01:03:48.217 --> 01:03:59.227]  Just finishing this thought for folks that don't know what Donna knows, that don't know what Alan knows, I'm just throwing this out because it's so important and I meant to make the point today and I'm glad you called in on synchronicity or serendipity, whichever one.
[01:03:59.467 --> 01:04:14.321]  The point here is, is that, just finishing a thought, they are clearly, as Secretary of Defense Cohen said in 97 in Army Times in the April issue,
[01:04:15.325 --> 01:04:16.646]  They do have weather weapons.
[01:04:16.666 --> 01:04:18.768]  They do have tectonic earthquake weapons.
[01:04:18.948 --> 01:04:19.588]  They said it.
[01:04:19.728 --> 01:04:20.329]  They admit it.
[01:04:20.589 --> 01:04:21.930]  They are manipulating the weather.
[01:04:22.170 --> 01:04:25.793]  So, finish up your comment, and then I want to get Alan Watts' take on that.
[01:04:26.573 --> 01:04:29.696]  Okay, well, there's a misconception about missile defense shield.
[01:04:30.777 --> 01:04:38.182]  The prevailing, what the mainstream puts out there is that missile defense shield are these interceptors which fail nine times out of ten.
[01:04:38.803 --> 01:04:44.687]  And in fact, missile defense shield is pulsed energy, electromagnetic energy, into the ionosphere.
[01:04:45.366 --> 01:04:51.208]  And I'm leaning toward thinking that the chemtrails that I'm witnessing right now outside my window have something to do with that.
[01:04:52.748 --> 01:04:57.450]  So what we have here is this shield of energy being created by antennas such as HAARP.
[01:04:57.490 --> 01:05:02.051]  And you say HAARP and you've got this horrible stigma just like you have when you say chemtrails.
[01:05:02.392 --> 01:05:03.532]  But it's a very real thing.
[01:05:04.156 --> 01:05:06.877]  And it's impacting everybody, everything, every living organism.
[01:05:06.917 --> 01:05:15.621]  Well governments admit that they use antennas to manipulate the atmosphere and that's in thousands, literally thousands of mainstream newspapers have reported on that.
[01:05:15.701 --> 01:05:17.021]  China does it, Russia does it.
[01:05:18.142 --> 01:05:21.303]  But the problem is we don't know the full extent of that.
[01:05:21.343 --> 01:05:23.544]  We do know that there are
[01:05:24.284 --> 01:05:31.450]  Thousands of spraying programs going on with aluminum dioxide, with barium salts being added to jet fuel.
[01:05:31.810 --> 01:05:33.312]  Perfect compartmentalization.
[01:05:33.352 --> 01:05:34.533]  The companies don't even know.
[01:05:35.053 --> 01:05:37.856]  It's only the three big jet fuel makers that are adding it.
[01:05:37.956 --> 01:05:39.157]  Alan Watt comments on this.
[01:05:40.018 --> 01:05:42.039]  It's much bigger even.
[01:05:42.199 --> 01:05:46.823]  The HAARP technology was used in the 1970s, early 70s, from Russia, Riga.
[01:05:47.504 --> 01:05:49.766]  In fact, the Soviet system and Latvia.
[01:05:50.826 --> 01:05:54.589]  And we find out now there's over 54 of them worldwide.
[01:05:55.749 --> 01:05:56.210]  The U.S.
[01:05:56.270 --> 01:06:01.994]  has one in, I think, Iceland and one in Greenland as well as one in Alaska, and they had one in Australia in Pine Grap.
[01:06:02.914 --> 01:06:05.856]  Now, they can work these in concert with each other.
[01:06:05.876 --> 01:06:16.583]  It was in the British papers they used it in the first Gulf War in Iraq, and it literally affected the minds of the soldiers who were just walking out the desert completely stunned.
[01:06:17.464 --> 01:06:18.865]  They hadn't been under bombardment.
[01:06:19.906 --> 01:06:23.529]  At least a visible bombardment, and yet they were like zombies.
[01:06:24.009 --> 01:06:25.210]  So it can affect the mind.
[01:06:25.350 --> 01:06:33.195]  Now, the harp technology, there's no doubt about it, this ties in with technotronic warfare that Brzezinski talked about in his book, Between Two Ages.
[01:06:33.235 --> 01:06:39.839]  He says, shortly a technique will be used on the public, and it will affect their minds, being very placid, etc.
[01:06:40.399 --> 01:06:46.603]  And it can also use it to put thoughts right into your head, if necessary, by using a secondary beam.
[01:06:47.284 --> 01:07:02.891]  The United Nations signed a document with all the countries that had HAARP technology in the 1970s, should look into that as under weather warfare, and the whole idea was dreamed up in the 50s with Teller, who was the inventor of the H-bomb.
[01:07:03.411 --> 01:07:08.293]  He said if they can doze the atmosphere with barium salts, aluminum oxide,
[01:07:08.937 --> 01:07:23.977]  And others, he said, we can make it very conductive and it will help this ELF frequency cover vast distances and they could use it either for altering the weather, weather modification, or they could cause global warming with it or freezing.
[01:07:24.137 --> 01:07:27.181]  One or the other depends on the type of frequency they hit it with.
[01:07:27.984 --> 01:07:31.546]  And it could also affect the mindset of a target population.
[01:07:31.846 --> 01:07:35.787]  So this is actually in the treaty at the United Nations from the seventies.
[01:07:35.867 --> 01:07:38.849]  They have this technology, they're using it extensively across the world.
[01:07:38.869 --> 01:07:56.876]  And by the way, the Baltimore Sun, eight years ago, did a big report admitting that DARPA is testing antenna arrays across the United States, and it said, to calm the American people, we put off these waves, we love you, we're the government,
[01:07:57.361 --> 01:08:01.142]  Yeah, I've got photographs from Canada, the States and Europe.
[01:08:01.222 --> 01:08:03.243]  They're putting up these strange antennas.
[01:08:03.303 --> 01:08:08.405]  They look like tall lampposts with a windsock on the end of it.
[01:08:09.465 --> 01:08:12.146]  I've seen this construction and photographed the construction.
[01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:24.788]  Where they have massive thick cables going into the bases of them and this is part of the Technotronic series set up where they can control crowds during and whole populations during times of crisis.
[01:08:24.808 --> 01:08:28.590]  They can make you literally zombified and very placid if they wish to.
[01:08:29.230 --> 01:08:30.571]  But that's freedom, Alan!
[01:08:31.231 --> 01:08:31.991]  That's the freedom.
[01:08:32.071 --> 01:08:32.652]  That's the freedom.
[01:08:32.672 --> 01:08:33.612]  That's their new freedom.
[01:08:36.734 --> 01:08:39.635]  Freedom was redefined by Mr. Bush himself.
[01:08:41.021 --> 01:08:47.245]  Well, for the people that think they're going to enforce this system, most of them aren't going to be part of the Brave New Future either, are they?
[01:08:48.146 --> 01:08:48.927]  No, they will not.
[01:08:50.768 --> 01:08:53.890]  I think, too, that'll start freaking out some as they get closer to their target.
[01:08:54.551 --> 01:08:58.213]  When they personally will see their end coming, they will no longer be necessary.
[01:08:58.894 --> 01:08:59.634]  This is interesting.
[01:08:59.654 --> 01:09:07.340]  You see, technology is very old, because the true sciences are kept back from the public and even from professors.
[01:09:08.052 --> 01:09:11.414]  There's much higher levels of technology and science existing.
[01:09:12.154 --> 01:09:27.943]  And we know this from Nick Biggage, who had a documentary on television on the Wendy Mesley Show, where he demonstrated the obsolete technology, little handheld remotes that the CIA used back in the 1950s, where they could put thoughts
[01:09:28.767 --> 01:09:30.888]  Directly into a target's mind.
[01:09:31.268 --> 01:09:40.253]  By the way, they had said Ted Stevens was beating his brother, but it looks like Senator Stevens is going to be Senator Stevens.
[01:09:40.273 --> 01:09:49.998]  Looks like he's beating, that's Nick Begich's brother, Mark Begich, so it looks like he's winning right now in that highly contested Senate race.
[01:09:50.038 --> 01:09:54.500]  Just a program note, you're absolutely right, they've suppressed a lot of technologies.
[01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:57.682]  Anything else you wanted to add there?
[01:09:58.859 --> 01:09:59.100]  Yes.
[01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:01.241]  One more thing, and this is really important.
[01:10:01.742 --> 01:10:08.047]  The powers of observation for everybody are critical, not just in terms of the geopolitical situation.
[01:10:08.087 --> 01:10:10.029]  I mean, we really have to use our minds.
[01:10:10.589 --> 01:10:17.054]  But in observing nature every day, if you really pay attention, you will see things you've never seen before.
[01:10:18.275 --> 01:10:19.556]  We had a period of six weeks.
[01:10:19.576 --> 01:10:23.520]  I live in a small mountain village in northern New Mexico where we have farming and ranching.
[01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:27.383]  There was a period of about six weeks or more where things stopped growing.
[01:10:28.263 --> 01:10:29.264]  Literally stopped growing.
[01:10:29.945 --> 01:10:31.026]  Flowers didn't bloom.
[01:10:31.827 --> 01:10:34.850]  Crops that had been planted weren't getting any bigger.
[01:10:35.631 --> 01:10:43.119]  And when I noticed it myself, with regard to my indoor plants and my outdoor flowers and so forth, these are plants that are potted, mind you, not even in the ground.
[01:10:43.995 --> 01:10:46.716]  Yeah, everything these elites do is about playing God.
[01:10:47.156 --> 01:10:52.657]  Total matrix dominance, total... I mean, they have all these terms, but go ahead.
[01:10:53.177 --> 01:10:54.237]  Full spectrum dominance.
[01:10:54.497 --> 01:10:56.437]  Well, this went on for weeks and weeks and weeks.
[01:10:56.617 --> 01:10:58.858]  They weren't dying, but they weren't flourishing.
[01:10:58.878 --> 01:10:59.618]  They weren't growing.
[01:11:00.278 --> 01:11:04.739]  So when I talked to local people, local farmers about it, they said, yes, they had observed the same thing.
[01:11:04.779 --> 01:11:05.859]  They didn't know what was going on.
[01:11:06.399 --> 01:11:10.820]  I posted on a message board that goes out across the country, and people posted the same thing.
[01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:12.400]  They said, yes, we noticed it was very strange.
[01:11:12.864 --> 01:11:18.929]  So what if, I mean it's a what if, what if this energy that they're manipulating could be used to stop things from growing?
[01:11:18.969 --> 01:11:39.507]  No, it could be used to kill you, so of course, but listen, 2 billion bees, or close to 80% of them in England, just drop dead, they're dropping dead everywhere, other animals are dropping dead, whole bird species are dying, meanwhile the globalists dance around going, it's for the earth, for the earth, when really they want to destroy the earth and rebuild it in their image playing God.
[01:11:40.308 --> 01:11:41.448]  Alan Watt is our guest.
[01:11:41.668 --> 01:11:43.989]  Again, we'll be right back for everybody on the AM and FM dial.
[01:11:44.389 --> 01:11:45.529]  We're going to take some more calls.
[01:11:45.549 --> 01:11:51.230]  I want to get to everybody here on the Infowars.com streams only during this break.
[01:11:51.970 --> 01:12:00.231]  You know, I joke around about all this because it would be too stressful if I didn't, but this is all very serious and it's all very, very painful to admit that we've gotten to this point.
[01:12:02.032 --> 01:12:03.972]  Okay, Alan, let's take another call.
[01:12:04.032 --> 01:12:07.253]  Very interesting call from Donna in New Mexico.
[01:12:07.653 --> 01:12:09.253]  Your comments to what she was just saying.
[01:12:10.038 --> 01:12:10.719]  She's right on.
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:20.834]  Even here in Canada, where I am here, this is the blueberry area for this country, and they literally didn't get enough sunlight this year.
[01:12:20.854 --> 01:12:23.839]  It rained every single day, June and July.
[01:12:24.239 --> 01:12:25.221]  Heavy, heavy spring.
[01:12:25.908 --> 01:12:29.109]  This is the global dimming they talk about at NASA.
[01:12:30.029 --> 01:12:40.053]  Yeah, NASA brags they've dimmed the Earth by 20 percent, that's BBC report, and they admit they're chemtrailing, but it's only on university sites, and then no news will touch it.
[01:12:41.113 --> 01:12:41.754]  That is correct.
[01:12:42.234 --> 01:12:44.675]  And also, there's no birds here.
[01:12:44.755 --> 01:12:45.775]  There's just no birds.
[01:12:45.795 --> 01:12:48.316]  I can walk through the forest here and there's not a single bird.
[01:12:48.636 --> 01:12:51.117]  The moles are coming out of the ground and dying.
[01:12:51.957 --> 01:12:54.618]  And I've noticed quite a few of them this last couple of months.
[01:12:55.146 --> 01:12:59.110]  So they're being poisoned by the stuff that's coming down in this spray as well.
[01:13:00.191 --> 01:13:01.432]  God, they're just slaughtering us.
[01:13:01.452 --> 01:13:08.799]  And then they're going to say it's a global economic environmental crisis and then say that we've all got to be enslaved to stop it.
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:12.342]  And then blame us for doing it and getting us to believe it.
[01:13:13.764 --> 01:13:14.965]  It's a brilliant strategy.
[01:13:16.405 --> 01:13:19.686]  All you've got to do is just be completely ruthless, and it's a brilliant strategy.
[01:13:20.567 --> 01:13:25.129]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rico in Toronto.
[01:13:25.269 --> 01:13:26.449]  Rico, you're on the air.
[01:13:26.469 --> 01:13:28.070]  Hi, how are you?
[01:13:28.490 --> 01:13:28.730]  Good.
[01:13:30.771 --> 01:13:36.634]  I really respect your work, Alex, of course, so I just wanted to say that off the bat.
[01:13:37.933 --> 01:13:45.398]  I'm sure you probably didn't get a chance to catch James Bond, the new movie that came out Friday.
[01:13:45.718 --> 01:13:50.461]  No, but every James Bond has all these pro-New World Order brainwashing messages.
[01:13:51.141 --> 01:13:52.262]  What's the latest brainwashing?
[01:13:52.922 --> 01:13:56.345]  Oh, Alex, this baby is crazy.
[01:13:56.945 --> 01:13:58.366]  Okay, there's a scene
[01:13:58.976 --> 01:14:11.146]  Where they go into a movie theater, like in a movie, not a movie theater, I'm sorry, a theater, where all the shadow elite group is like communicating in the theater itself.
[01:14:11.666 --> 01:14:18.451]  There's a giant eye that opens up, and it's all Catholic priests.
[01:14:19.432 --> 01:14:28.119]  Then, at the bottom of it, of the altar, if you will, there's a bunch of people who are being dragged as prisoners
[01:14:28.775 --> 01:14:33.519]  So they're just throwing Illuminati Catholic, the Catholic Church's Illuminati, human sacrifice?
[01:14:56.246 --> 01:15:00.988]  Yes, and it's like, basically it's like the goddess Gaia, she's sacrificing to the eye.
[01:15:01.468 --> 01:15:09.291]  Then after that you have, um, basically like the whole movie is about a war for the resources.
[01:15:10.231 --> 01:15:19.995]  The shadow group makes the government, the dictator, that they're putting back in, sell them the water rights, basically like the whole country.
[01:15:20.075 --> 01:15:25.237]  But let me guess, the MI6 James Bond is going to save us?
[01:15:26.178 --> 01:15:31.524]  Yes, he basically goes like he's not with it, the Americans are with it.
[01:15:32.313 --> 01:15:33.813]  The CIA section chief is with it.
[01:15:33.833 --> 01:15:34.654]  Well, let me just say this.
[01:15:34.714 --> 01:15:36.814]  I mean, obviously the Vatican's corrupting the New World Order.
[01:15:36.834 --> 01:15:38.014]  I mean, I'm not even Catholic.
[01:15:38.675 --> 01:15:45.296]  But I am seeing major pushes to make it only about it being a Catholic conspiracy in the media.
[01:15:45.656 --> 01:15:55.499]  But then, meanwhile, the new Da Vinci Code movie, Angels and Devils, is about the Catholic Church being the good guys and it being an Anglo-American Merovingian.
[01:15:56.379 --> 01:15:59.800]  Alan Watt, let's come back out of break and get your comment on this.
[01:16:03.661 --> 01:16:07.363]  Okay, behind the scenes there we were talking to Rico in Toronto.
[01:16:07.383 --> 01:16:08.844]  He went and saw the new James Bond movie.
[01:16:10.125 --> 01:16:12.566]  No, I didn't go see it.
[01:16:13.207 --> 01:16:17.089]  I'm dealing with all the admitted world government being set up in front of me.
[01:16:17.569 --> 01:16:23.873]  They talk about how it's like Catholic priests doing human sacrifice to the Illuminati in the movie, and I've got some emails about it.
[01:16:23.893 --> 01:16:25.034]  I haven't seen it myself yet.
[01:16:27.635 --> 01:16:31.918]  So on that side it's saying it's a Catholic conspiracy, but then you have the new angels and devils
[01:16:32.842 --> 01:16:52.408]  uh... coming out uh... with uh... you know that all these big actors like tom hanks where it's the catholics fighting the Illuminati and and and i tell you what that is that's about making it factionalized or divide and conquer where now people will fight about which group is it really when the new world order controls both groups uh... correct alan want
[01:16:53.542 --> 01:16:54.164]  Absolutely.
[01:16:54.184 --> 01:16:55.626]  There's no doubt about it.
[01:16:55.666 --> 01:17:02.659]  Even Malachi Martin, who was a Jesuit priest, said that the Vatican had been totally taken over and is now run by Freemasons.
[01:17:02.939 --> 01:17:06.165]  And these are the same Freemasons that run the Protestant sites as well.
[01:17:06.818 --> 01:17:10.021]  It's the same Freemasons that go over and get knighted by the royalty.
[01:17:10.421 --> 01:17:12.983]  That's one of their high ambitions, of course, if you serve the great works.
[01:17:13.003 --> 01:17:14.064]  And see, let's be clear.
[01:17:14.084 --> 01:17:16.706]  We're not having a debate about the Catholic Church pushing world government.
[01:17:16.726 --> 01:17:17.947]  The last two popes have called for it.
[01:17:18.207 --> 01:17:19.268]  We're not debating that.
[01:17:19.589 --> 01:17:21.770]  We're just stating the facts of what it is today.
[01:17:22.411 --> 01:17:32.479]  And for some reason, groups out of Israel fund the idea that if you don't only talk about Catholics being the source of all evil, that you are in their employ.
[01:17:32.739 --> 01:17:34.481]  And that's just massive disinfo.
[01:17:35.379 --> 01:17:46.141]  That's right, even though in Israel itself there is a Masonic lodge there, where some of the Muslim leaders attend, along with the Jewish leaders and leaders from the Western world.
[01:17:46.161 --> 01:17:55.324]  There's been articles in the paper here from a Jewish leader in Toronto with his regalia on, his Masonic regalia, going off to that particular lodge representing Canada.
[01:17:55.904 --> 01:17:56.944]  So, you understand,
[01:17:57.446 --> 01:18:00.187]  You should say that ISIS had a thousand faces.
[01:18:00.227 --> 01:18:03.848]  Well, you see, this is the organization with a thousand faces and fronts.
[01:18:04.508 --> 01:18:05.809]  There are a thousand points of light.
[01:18:05.869 --> 01:18:08.329]  And the Masons are only one more of those fronts.
[01:18:08.349 --> 01:18:14.751]  Yeah, there's blue, there's raw arch, but they all take their orders from the English Lodge.
[01:18:14.771 --> 01:18:16.072]  That's where they get their charters from.
[01:18:17.412 --> 01:18:19.533]  Just like all royalty gets its charter from there.
[01:18:20.153 --> 01:18:23.714]  Yes, and the Duke of Kent, traditionally, is the head of
[01:18:25.124 --> 01:18:32.351]  Do you agree with those statements?
[01:18:35.294 --> 01:18:36.175]  I do, I do.
[01:18:37.456 --> 01:18:44.042]  It was crazy because they were showing you that it's a cabal of all industrialists.
[01:18:44.423 --> 01:18:48.767]  But the British are good and they're going to save us from the cabal, right?
[01:18:49.727 --> 01:18:54.909]  Well, they wanted to go along with it, but supposedly James Bond did not want to go along with it.
[01:18:55.549 --> 01:19:09.273]  Then after that, but it's like it leaves you with like, okay, this shadow group is still out there, they're still doing what they're doing, and yeah, and the ministry even goes along with it, with a lot of resources.
[01:19:09.963 --> 01:19:11.824]  So we've got to go ahead and do it with the Shadow Grip once.
[01:19:11.844 --> 01:19:12.644]  I appreciate your call.
[01:19:13.584 --> 01:19:16.766]  That's throwing it in your face, and we're seeing that everywhere, Alan.
[01:19:17.126 --> 01:19:19.607]  Explain to people what predictive programming is.
[01:19:20.447 --> 01:19:34.193]  Yeah, predictive programming is a technique developed in London for the BBC by Tavistock Institute, where they experimented on, first of all, mental patients, and then they expanded it into the general population by surveys and tests, etc.
[01:19:35.131 --> 01:19:56.407]  And they found out that mainly through fiction, because your sensor part of the brain is down, you don't expect to have to make decisions on information, you're being entertained, your sensor is down, and therefore all of the messages that are wrapped into generally a fight and flight scenario, where the hero gets chased, there's a lot of chasing going on and your adrenaline's up,
[01:19:56.897 --> 01:19:59.459]  It's attached to emotion and sex and so on.
[01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:08.367]  Then many messages can be downloaded into your subconscious to make you familiar with this new possibility called possibility programming.
[01:20:09.067 --> 01:20:13.971]  And so now when we talk about it, they're comfortable with it because, oh, everybody knows about that.
[01:20:14.252 --> 01:20:16.273]  Everybody knows the CIA deals the drugs.
[01:20:16.553 --> 01:20:19.096]  Everybody knows they put cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[01:20:19.436 --> 01:20:21.718]  I mean, a lot of people don't even deny what we're saying.
[01:20:21.978 --> 01:20:24.060]  They just go, OK, yeah, everybody knows that.
[01:20:24.895 --> 01:20:31.397]  That's right, but they don't realize that they now have opinions and conclusions, and they have no idea how they arrived at those opinions.
[01:20:32.077 --> 01:20:32.477]  Absolutely.
[01:20:32.517 --> 01:20:33.298]  Just hold on to them.
[01:20:33.458 --> 01:20:34.858]  Let's jam in another call here.
[01:20:35.018 --> 01:20:35.959]  Jeremy in Canada.
[01:20:35.979 --> 01:20:37.219]  A lot of calls from where you're at.
[01:20:37.579 --> 01:20:38.699]  Jeremy, you're on the air.
[01:20:39.340 --> 01:20:40.220]  Okay.
[01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:49.863]  Listen, I really appreciate what you and Alan are doing, and other people like you in the alternative media, because you're the only ones I hear speaking the truth these days.
[01:20:51.023 --> 01:20:52.104]  I just have one question.
[01:20:54.025 --> 01:21:01.653]  Wouldn't the Bilderbergers and the elites who are killing us with soft kill, are they suicidal as well as homicidal?
[01:21:01.693 --> 01:21:05.437]  Because like on the subject of the disappearing mail,
[01:21:06.485 --> 01:21:10.188]  Wouldn't their sperm count be way down, and wouldn't their children be deformed too?
[01:21:10.608 --> 01:21:13.511]  No, when you read, they all avoid the plastics.
[01:21:13.931 --> 01:21:15.412]  They avoid the vaccines.
[01:21:15.452 --> 01:21:20.376]  I mean, it's like when I had the state director on about them forcibly injecting the kids in Maryland.
[01:21:20.757 --> 01:21:24.420]  He said, it's no law, you're right, and I don't, my kids don't take them.
[01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:25.821]  And then he laughed.
[01:21:26.161 --> 01:21:27.422]  You see, it's that pleasure.
[01:21:27.582 --> 01:21:27.823]  Alan?
[01:21:28.803 --> 01:21:35.349]  What's interesting, back in the 60s, I think it was, that was a small time tolling around, but there's a documentary on the Queen
[01:21:35.928 --> 01:21:40.231]  And how she had her own personal herbalist who dealt with the soap she used and everything else.
[01:21:40.271 --> 01:21:41.592]  But they don't use what we use.
[01:21:41.612 --> 01:21:46.094]  They understand the agenda and they make sure they're healthy and their offspring are healthy too.
[01:21:46.314 --> 01:21:48.236]  Yeah, does that answer your question?
[01:21:48.996 --> 01:21:50.497]  Jeremy, hold on, hold on.
[01:21:51.057 --> 01:21:51.958]  We're on the march.
[01:21:52.938 --> 01:21:54.199]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:54.279 --> 01:21:57.041]  It's Alan Watt and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:58.902 --> 01:22:00.223]  Yeah, go ahead Jeremy, finish up.
[01:22:01.047 --> 01:22:08.052]  Okay, what about some of these plastic dangerous chemicals are right in the atmosphere of the whole planet, so they'd be breathing it too.
[01:22:08.693 --> 01:22:10.714]  Well they are, and the fact is they're doing it.
[01:22:11.134 --> 01:22:14.637]  I mean, everything Alan's telling you that I'm telling you, they admit, sir.
[01:22:15.177 --> 01:22:23.203]  I mean, we can give you all the sources, they're on cuttingthroughthematrix.com, they're on infowars.com, they're on our sites, I make films about them, Alan does presentations about them.
[01:22:25.444 --> 01:22:28.066]  They also understand how these things cross and mix.
[01:22:29.795 --> 01:22:33.857]  It's a nexus of, take the Batman movies.
[01:22:33.957 --> 01:22:53.489]  In the Batman movie, one of them they say, from back 15 years ago, yeah, we staged terror attacks like the Gulf of Tonkin, or this event, or hey, we're crossing a whole bunch of different hair care and face care products, but together they poison you.
[01:22:53.709 --> 01:22:55.850]  And then they sell you the solution.
[01:22:56.071 --> 01:22:57.992]  Well, see, that's what they really do in the real world.
[01:22:58.852 --> 01:22:59.212]  Okay.
[01:23:00.133 --> 01:23:02.215]  So, I mean, these people are obsessive-compulsive.
[01:23:02.235 --> 01:23:06.900]  They're all about intricately woven systems, and they brag about it.
[01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:13.626]  Lord Rothschild, two weeks ago, in a major paper saying, you know, we run the world, we're setting up world government, world governance.
[01:23:13.666 --> 01:23:20.312]  He said, my family's most proud of how we've kept our wealth, not been decadent, controlled our family.
[01:23:20.832 --> 01:23:22.054]  See, they're all about
[01:23:22.594 --> 01:23:29.419]  Keeping their money, institutions, and the general public's like, how can something last 500 years?
[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:32.962]  They don't understand, it's like universities or organizations.
[01:23:33.763 --> 01:23:34.864]  Alan, you want to explain that to him?
[01:23:35.584 --> 01:23:36.985]  Yes, it's intergenerational.
[01:23:37.306 --> 01:23:40.568]  Foundations can go on for centuries with the same mandate.
[01:23:41.229 --> 01:23:45.933]  Retiring, using, and rehiring new ones into the same agenda.
[01:23:46.673 --> 01:23:48.094]  The families all breed together?
[01:23:48.374 --> 01:23:50.076]  Even the servant families breed together?
[01:23:50.481 --> 01:23:52.042]  Yes, it's all eugenics.
[01:23:52.062 --> 01:23:57.344]  Rockefeller ran the eugenics system back in the 30s and 40s and so on.
[01:23:57.364 --> 01:24:01.006]  They were the ones who mandated forced sterilization of what they called the feeble-minded.
[01:24:01.606 --> 01:24:02.847]  And they're still into that yet.
[01:24:02.887 --> 01:24:10.030]  I've heard Rockefeller in a recent speech talking about the need to reduce the population and that there's too many basically common types at the bottom.
[01:24:11.050 --> 01:24:12.071]  So it's never changed.
[01:24:12.871 --> 01:24:15.873]  I totally agree that they are doing eugenics and that
[01:24:16.997 --> 01:24:20.861]  They want to get rid of the inferiors, which is most of us.
[01:24:22.022 --> 01:24:27.467]  But I'm just wondering, the pollution in the atmosphere, are they really totally responsible for that?
[01:24:27.487 --> 01:24:28.929]  Because they're breathing that air too.
[01:24:29.309 --> 01:24:31.111]  Yeah, but you understand how these people live.
[01:24:31.151 --> 01:24:34.154]  They live, if you take a Buckingham Palace, it's rigged up.
[01:24:34.730 --> 01:24:34.870]  Do you
[01:24:54.540 --> 01:24:56.901]  Yeah, we're going back to the main audience.
[01:24:57.201 --> 01:24:59.282]  They also do total body blood transfusions.
[01:24:59.302 --> 01:24:59.603]  Here we go.
[01:24:59.623 --> 01:25:00.623]  Alright, final segment with Alan Watt.
[01:25:00.663 --> 01:25:01.824]  This show has just blasted past us.
[01:25:01.844 --> 01:25:02.664]  Dr. Kyle, Scott,
[01:25:25.936 --> 01:25:27.917]  Dave, Andy and others.
[01:25:28.497 --> 01:25:30.898]  We're going to go back to Alan Watt here in just a moment.
[01:25:33.138 --> 01:25:42.581]  But before I go any further, I do want to tell you about some of our sponsors.
[01:25:44.342 --> 01:25:46.042]  And one of them is Inner Health Botanicals.
[01:25:46.062 --> 01:25:54.865]  You know, I plugged them last hour and forgot to tell you that they have a lot of new products in their product line like Natural Amino Acid Meal Replacement.
[01:25:56.018 --> 01:25:58.360]  Talk about something for dieting or something for emergencies.
[01:25:58.740 --> 01:26:03.344]  It's basically a natural, healthy, effective way to lose weight while getting all the nutrients your body needs.
[01:26:03.704 --> 01:26:07.708]  How it works, you mix up a cup and a glass of juice and have it in place of a meal.
[01:26:07.748 --> 01:26:12.932]  For example, you can replace one of your meals every day, stay healthy, get all your nutrients and lose weight in the process.
[01:26:13.412 --> 01:26:18.436]  Check it out at E-N-E-R, just innerfood.com.
[01:26:18.696 --> 01:26:19.777]  E-N-E-R, food.com.
[01:26:20.788 --> 01:26:25.191]  Or check out the natural amino acid meal replacement by calling 866-762-9238, 866-762-9238.
[01:26:25.651 --> 01:26:32.095]  And these aren't just great sponsors we go out and get.
[01:26:32.315 --> 01:26:33.216]  I only get stuff I believe in.
[01:26:33.736 --> 01:26:35.497]  It also makes what we're doing here possible.
[01:26:36.077 --> 01:26:40.920]  I want to do online, and probably on TV, daily news review shows.
[01:26:41.741 --> 01:26:47.204]  And I'm so busy, I'm going to try to hire somebody to come in and do it in our office.
[01:26:48.045 --> 01:26:48.565]  More people.
[01:26:50.919 --> 01:26:54.380]  But the point is, I got a lot of things I want to do to fight these people.
[01:26:54.701 --> 01:26:55.501]  We need your support.
[01:26:55.521 --> 01:26:59.122]  So go to InfoWars.com, buy the books and videos, get them out to people.
[01:26:59.162 --> 01:27:01.263]  They wake folks up and it supports what we're doing here.
[01:27:01.783 --> 01:27:03.844]  Support our sponsors like Interfood, 866-762-9238.
[01:27:07.459 --> 01:27:12.663]  Also, one other sponsor I want to plug is New Vitality.
[01:27:12.683 --> 01:27:17.407]  This is an old, large vitamin and mineral and nutrient company.
[01:27:17.847 --> 01:27:26.715]  No magic cures, no miracle stuff, just things that are proven to really have good nutritive and health effects, like their Aloe Ease Body Cleanse flushes out your guts, detoxifies,
[01:27:27.435 --> 01:27:33.700]  It's got aloe vera and 30 other powerful herbs known to detoxify.
[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:35.381]  800-569-4056 or newvitality.com.
[01:27:35.401 --> 01:27:38.183]  Got big banners up on infowars.com.
[01:27:38.203 --> 01:27:38.883]  800-569-4056.
[01:27:39.584 --> 01:27:42.686]  They have super beta prostate.
[01:27:42.926 --> 01:27:44.708]  Really great for your prostate.
[01:27:45.028 --> 01:27:47.890]  After 45, younger people can even take it as well.
[01:27:47.910 --> 01:27:47.990]  800-569-4056.
[01:27:48.110 --> 01:27:52.273]  The salt palm meadow and a bunch of other ingredients.
[01:27:52.293 --> 01:27:53.674]  They've got the most popular
[01:27:55.962 --> 01:28:01.204]  It's a big company, one of the most popular mixes out there for the prostate, 800-569-4056.
[01:28:01.524 --> 01:28:06.466]  I want to make something clear before I take some final calls for Alan Watt here.
[01:28:06.706 --> 01:28:07.586]  We really appreciate it.
[01:28:09.227 --> 01:28:11.327]  You know, I don't even lose sleep dealing with this.
[01:28:11.347 --> 01:28:19.090]  I mean, I do sometimes, but not as much as I would if I just didn't do the best job I can fighting it and move forward.
[01:28:20.370 --> 01:28:21.691]  You're only alive one time.
[01:28:23.854 --> 01:28:27.396]  There are just very wicked focus control freaks that run the planet.
[01:28:29.356 --> 01:28:32.738]  They say it's their right to do this to us because survival of the fittest.
[01:28:32.758 --> 01:28:33.338]  They're in control.
[01:28:33.358 --> 01:28:33.798]  We're not.
[01:28:34.759 --> 01:28:36.059]  And I liken them to cancer.
[01:28:36.140 --> 01:28:37.620]  You know, cancer can take over a body.
[01:28:37.660 --> 01:28:40.361]  Cancer is quote dominant in the tissues of the body.
[01:28:40.762 --> 01:28:43.303]  But it ends up killing the host.
[01:28:45.544 --> 01:28:48.725]  And it's the same thing with the global elite.
[01:28:49.285 --> 01:28:50.546]  I don't think they're in total control.
[01:28:50.566 --> 01:28:51.526]  They've lost their minds.
[01:28:51.586 --> 01:28:52.167]  They're crazy.
[01:28:54.782 --> 01:29:04.866]  They say there's no such thing as a genetic mutation, so when they create chimera cross-species creations, they just say, well, man's a natural mutation, and so anything we make is a natural mutation.
[01:29:05.266 --> 01:29:07.587]  So all their talk about the environment is a bunch of bull.
[01:29:08.647 --> 01:29:10.568]  They don't even care about themselves at certain levels.
[01:29:10.628 --> 01:29:11.748]  Some of them do, some don't.
[01:29:11.768 --> 01:29:19.671]  A lot of them are very nihilistic, and openly state, and we have this in Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, that they
[01:29:21.724 --> 01:29:23.245]  Might want to just destroy the earth for fun.
[01:29:23.285 --> 01:29:29.911]  You know, it's like Nero burning Rome or Caligula marrying his horse.
[01:29:29.991 --> 01:29:32.894]  I mean, throughout history these guys go crazy.
[01:29:33.755 --> 01:29:36.077]  So there is some megalomania going on here.
[01:29:37.078 --> 01:29:40.681]  But this is just a huge institution of evil.
[01:29:41.642 --> 01:29:44.964]  And they select more evil people into their ranks as the older ones die.
[01:29:45.965 --> 01:29:48.728]  And to them, I mean, it's a great honor that
[01:29:49.793 --> 01:29:53.676]  Zbigniew Brzezinski brags that he supported Paul Pott and helped him kill two million people.
[01:29:53.716 --> 01:29:57.339]  He's very proud of that and they honor him when he walks on stage anywhere.
[01:29:57.599 --> 01:29:58.620]  They look at him with respect.
[01:29:58.640 --> 01:29:59.621]  Oh, you killed two million.
[01:30:00.501 --> 01:30:01.943]  Kissinger killed tens of millions.
[01:30:02.023 --> 01:30:04.485]  That's why there's just such respect for him.
[01:30:06.146 --> 01:30:09.569]  These people, we respect the tough job you've done.
[01:30:10.424 --> 01:30:11.905]  Well, someone has to do it.
[01:30:31.021 --> 01:30:35.044]  I want you, in closing, to speak to the enemy's mindset.
[01:30:36.024 --> 01:30:42.428]  I mean, was I accurately, from your position studying it, was I accurately trying to articulate their mindset?
[01:30:43.529 --> 01:30:43.809]  Yes.
[01:30:43.969 --> 01:30:54.837]  What they've found with psychopaths, like Hitler, he said that the German people could not conquer the world, did not deserve to live under his own theory, the Darwinistic theory.
[01:30:55.357 --> 01:30:59.900]  And you find with Israel, Israel did drag the Prime Minister Beginoff
[01:31:00.858 --> 01:31:05.061]  When you had the Samson Complex, when you said, well, if Israel goes down, we will take the world with us.
[01:31:05.721 --> 01:31:08.383]  That's a standard psychopathic response.
[01:31:08.523 --> 01:31:11.164]  Complete nihilism if they cannot win and get their way.
[01:31:11.545 --> 01:31:21.291]  However, most of them at the top have utter faith in their own abilities and their money and power to buy the sciences they need to help their own survival.
[01:31:21.731 --> 01:31:28.335]  And so they pin everything on higher sciences, which are kept quiet from the public, to pull themselves through.
[01:31:29.885 --> 01:31:33.807]  Same thing with Hitler and his super weapons, but they do have the underground bases.
[01:31:34.227 --> 01:31:37.790]  I mean, in Switzerland or in Russia, they have underground bases with a whole population of food.
[01:31:38.110 --> 01:31:47.916]  Here, we're told they don't exist while they're in the Congressional Office, Budget Office, they admit it exists, but they tell us, the dumbest people on Earth, no, it doesn't exist, or the most mind-controlled people on Earth, I should say.
[01:31:48.517 --> 01:31:50.898]  And so they're also very confident because they have those facilities.
[01:31:51.699 --> 01:31:54.541]  Yes, they have total faith in forward planning.
[01:31:55.271 --> 01:32:04.793]  And the unlimited financing that can be taken from the taxpayer and funneled into building their safe houses and their underground bases.
[01:32:05.153 --> 01:32:06.693]  And they're well stocked up as well.
[01:32:07.113 --> 01:32:15.255]  Margaret Thatcher talked about that when she was in power because she was spending incredible amounts of the taxpayer's money on building these things for the elite.
[01:32:15.715 --> 01:32:16.615]  She was quizzed on it.
[01:32:16.975 --> 01:32:23.296]  She said if the common people try to get in, the SAS will machine gun them down because no commoner would be allowed in.
[01:32:26.089 --> 01:32:29.010]  That's right.
[01:32:29.030 --> 01:32:29.750]  That's the arrogance.
[01:32:29.910 --> 01:32:33.992]  And by the way, Michael Crichton did come out about global warming.
[01:32:34.472 --> 01:32:37.633]  His last book was about the New World Order, State of Fear.
[01:32:37.693 --> 01:32:38.113]  I read it.
[01:32:39.033 --> 01:32:40.594]  It came out in 2006.
[01:32:40.814 --> 01:32:44.935]  It was about the New World Order, how they're engineering the mass extermination.
[01:32:45.676 --> 01:32:47.456]  And I know people that knew Michael Crichton.
[01:32:47.496 --> 01:32:50.617]  He died of an accelerated, basically very quick act in cancer.
[01:32:50.637 --> 01:32:52.158]  He was in great health, a medical doctor.
[01:32:52.958 --> 01:32:54.218]  And I believe they got rid of him.
[01:32:54.819 --> 01:32:55.439]  Mark Cuban,
[01:32:57.065 --> 01:32:58.325]  Was going to put out loose change.
[01:32:58.365 --> 01:33:00.626]  He backed off after threats and he was threatened.
[01:33:00.646 --> 01:33:01.747]  We should do an article about that.
[01:33:02.867 --> 01:33:04.068]  So he did back off of it.
[01:33:04.528 --> 01:33:11.050]  And then notice you have trillions being stolen by the bankers, but they claim he stole a stock, selling his own stock.
[01:33:11.550 --> 01:33:14.391]  $700,000 and he's worth like $5 billion.
[01:33:15.912 --> 01:33:18.313]  Selling some stock of some little company.
[01:33:19.013 --> 01:33:20.894]  But again, the public will think of him as rich.
[01:33:20.934 --> 01:33:24.096]  He owns a basketball team, just like they burned Martha Stewart.
[01:33:24.377 --> 01:33:31.101]  So none of the bankers, Kashkari or Paulson, they won't get in trouble.
[01:33:31.521 --> 01:33:32.662]  And of course, they're minions too.
[01:33:33.462 --> 01:33:37.925]  No, no, it's going to be Mark Cuban, and he's going to be punished now for even thinking about it.
[01:33:37.945 --> 01:33:39.446]  And remember, O'Reilly threatened him.
[01:33:39.486 --> 01:33:41.127]  He said, you will be taken down.
[01:33:41.488 --> 01:33:43.309]  Do not make it or you're gone, buddy.
[01:33:43.529 --> 01:33:43.949]  You hear me?
[01:33:44.329 --> 01:33:44.950]  I'm talking about
[01:33:46.463 --> 01:33:47.664]  Oh, they are ruthless at the top, absolutely ruthless.
[01:33:47.704 --> 01:33:49.545]  They had James Goldsmith, Sir James Goldsmith, who
[01:34:11.673 --> 01:34:12.174]  I don't think so.
[01:34:25.987 --> 01:34:27.888]  And of course, there's more than just that.
[01:34:28.528 --> 01:34:36.673]  We have the guy that was going to get us out of Iraq and England, and who was going to beat Gordon Brown, and ooh, something happened to him real fast.
[01:34:37.273 --> 01:34:43.617]  Kelly, he said they'll find me in the woods with my wrist cut.
[01:34:44.557 --> 01:34:46.338]  And sure enough, they did, but they found no blood.
[01:34:46.398 --> 01:34:51.201]  But we know their standard MO, they're utterly ruthless at the top.
[01:34:51.221 --> 01:34:55.403]  And those who join their circles and join their fraternities,
[01:34:55.859 --> 01:34:58.121]  And take-offs do put themselves at risk.
[01:34:58.161 --> 01:34:58.761]  They know that.
[01:34:59.461 --> 01:35:04.205]  Most of them think they'll never have to recount for it or stand up for it.
[01:35:04.545 --> 01:35:08.287]  But they do know if they cross the line, their lives can be forfeit.
[01:35:08.528 --> 01:35:11.029]  What do the elites think of us, Alan, from your study?
[01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:21.076]  Oh, I always liken it to the sadist breaking the legs of the cow and down it goes.
[01:35:21.576 --> 01:35:24.058]  And then they kick the cow because it can't get up.
[01:35:24.631 --> 01:35:33.576]  In other words, they've dumbed us down, they've poisoned us, they've dropped the IQ, they've literally bioengineered us until we were almost transsexual as we are today.
[01:35:34.657 --> 01:35:41.441]  And they laugh at us, they laugh at the mess we're in, and they have this complete disdain for us, in fact.
[01:35:41.601 --> 01:35:49.165]  That's right, they laugh at us wallowing in our excrement on the ground with broken legs, drooling in pain, and they say, look at how ugly they are!
[01:35:49.465 --> 01:35:51.326]  Look at how beautiful we are!
[01:35:51.567 --> 01:35:53.508]  I mean, that is the ultimate in selfishness.
[01:35:54.315 --> 01:36:19.770]  Yeah, I was watching a documentary, it was made in Germany during World War II, where some psychiatrists were explaining to schoolchildren why they had to kill off the feeble-minded, and they showed you the most extreme examples of deformed people with very low IQs, and I thought, this is exactly the same technique that they're conditioning the whole public, they're conditioning the victims to accept their own demise.
[01:36:20.170 --> 01:36:21.131]  That's what they're doing right now.
[01:36:23.675 --> 01:36:28.118]  Well, I want to jam in very quickly, a few final calls here.
[01:36:29.039 --> 01:36:29.939]  Who's up next, John?
[01:36:30.820 --> 01:36:31.580]  Kyle in Florida.
[01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:32.461]  Kyle in Florida.
[01:36:32.501 --> 01:36:33.642]  Go ahead, you're on the air with Alan Watt.
[01:36:34.542 --> 01:36:35.583]  Yeah, how you doing, Al?
[01:36:35.783 --> 01:36:36.304]  Good, go ahead.
[01:36:36.324 --> 01:36:36.804]  Not so bad.
[01:36:37.885 --> 01:36:42.988]  Um, yeah, I just, I actually, first of all, your show is amazing.
[01:36:43.448 --> 01:36:50.953]  You have unbelievable insight and I hope the general public
[01:36:53.095 --> 01:36:56.898]  You know, knows what you know.
[01:36:57.338 --> 01:37:20.176]  My question to you is, I have a situation going on where I'm prescribed with painkillers and my doctor decided to drug test me and apparently I came up positive for certain things that were not prescribed.
[01:37:20.917 --> 01:37:24.821]  And did not come up for what they prescribed me.
[01:37:27.123 --> 01:37:34.109]  After that, they urine tested me and then I went and had a blood test done.
[01:37:36.912 --> 01:37:45.019]  After that, I'm just kind of wondering, you know, why they are trying to
[01:37:48.778 --> 01:37:50.799]  Make this a criminal.
[01:38:18.998 --> 01:38:25.783]  And so, yes, they go, they put you on painkillers, then it's a schedule three, then they test you, then they find marijuana.
[01:38:26.103 --> 01:38:29.985]  You know, when a mother goes in, they don't tell you, they find marijuana in a mother, kid's gone.
[01:38:30.406 --> 01:38:31.687]  They find any alcohol.
[01:38:31.727 --> 01:38:34.488]  They find, and about a third of the time, it's a false positive.
[01:38:34.508 --> 01:38:35.609]  They CPS your kids.
[01:38:35.989 --> 01:38:42.674]  The whole system is meant to destroy individuality and to get control of your life.
[01:38:42.714 --> 01:38:44.435]  So, folks, never take
[01:38:45.745 --> 01:38:46.365]  Painkillers.
[01:38:46.686 --> 01:38:50.949]  I mean, even if you're in really bad pain, because if you get addicted, they're going to ruin your life.
[01:38:51.069 --> 01:38:53.671]  Never take their illegal drugs, because they want to catch you.
[01:38:53.711 --> 01:38:55.292]  You defeat them by living clean.
[01:38:55.592 --> 01:38:57.074]  You defeat them by living well.
[01:38:57.394 --> 01:39:00.556]  You defeat them by realizing they're scum and filth and garbage.
[01:39:00.976 --> 01:39:02.478]  Young people, do not use drugs.
[01:39:02.498 --> 01:39:03.478]  Do not think it's cool.
[01:39:03.679 --> 01:39:05.060]  They're brought here for you.
[01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:06.821]  Don't even get into the gateway drugs.
[01:39:07.081 --> 01:39:09.483]  Keep your head down if your parents put you in a government camp.
[01:39:09.803 --> 01:39:10.864]  Keep your mouth shut.
[01:39:11.224 --> 01:39:12.265]  They're there to destroy you.
[01:39:13.786 --> 01:39:16.787]  I mean, I could rant and rant, but Alan, in closing, you want to comment on that?
[01:39:17.928 --> 01:39:18.488]  It's true.
[01:39:18.748 --> 01:39:19.168]  It is true.
[01:39:19.188 --> 01:39:32.494]  They run both sides of the drug industry, legal and illegal, and you would not have the excuse to build up the massive police forces always under the guise of recruitment to fight the drug war if it wasn't for them putting out the drugs themselves.
[01:39:33.175 --> 01:39:36.376]  And we know for a fact, and I've read articles from some of the top
[01:39:37.117 --> 01:39:41.099]  X Special Forces men who were involved in bringing the drugs into the country.
[01:39:41.399 --> 01:39:47.602]  We see the Oliver North scandal with the drugs for guns with the Contras and so on.
[01:39:47.902 --> 01:39:51.984]  The government itself are the biggest drug dealers of all time.
[01:39:52.932 --> 01:39:54.233]  So, we want them in society.
[01:39:54.253 --> 01:39:55.094]  It's been a pleasure, Alex.
[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:36.397]  I got a few final stories I'm going to hit at the very end of the show that we haven't gotten to and maybe jam in a few final calls, but I want to introduce Ted Anderson with this little piece of music because people, you know where the gold's at?
[01:40:36.437 --> 01:40:38.139]  Well, I know where the gold's at.
[01:40:38.159 --> 01:40:38.520]  Here it is.
[01:40:52.322 --> 01:40:53.163]  Give me the dough.
[01:40:53.323 --> 01:40:54.024]  I want the dough.
[01:40:54.044 --> 01:40:54.684]  I want the dough.
[01:40:54.724 --> 01:40:55.545]  Give me the dough.
[01:40:55.565 --> 01:40:56.426]  I want the dough.
[01:40:56.446 --> 01:40:57.067]  I want the dough.
[01:40:57.087 --> 01:40:57.967]  I want the dough.
[01:40:58.027 --> 01:40:59.188]  Give me the dough.
[01:40:59.329 --> 01:41:00.089]  I want the dough.
[01:41:00.109 --> 01:41:00.730]  I want the dough.
[01:41:43.530 --> 01:41:44.311]  Oh my goodness!
[01:41:44.391 --> 01:41:46.553]  Well, you just saw the Gimme the Gold video.
[01:41:47.033 --> 01:41:47.674]  I want the gold!
[01:41:47.694 --> 01:41:48.434]  What's the gold at?
[01:41:48.674 --> 01:41:49.655]  Well, I'll tell you what the gold at.
[01:41:49.695 --> 01:41:51.637]  The gold is with Ted Anderson.
[01:41:52.557 --> 01:42:00.744]  And Ted Anderson has got gold that he bought a week ago, when gold was fifty-something bucks under what it is now, so he can pass on those gigantor savings.
[01:42:01.284 --> 01:42:05.828]  Most people don't even have gold right now, ladies and gentlemen, but if they do, they're selling it at huge premiums.
[01:42:06.288 --> 01:42:07.709]  Well, Ted Anderson happens to have it
[01:42:08.470 --> 01:42:09.350]  With no premium.
[01:42:09.370 --> 01:42:12.651]  In fact, below the price, it should be sold because he's a smart guy.
[01:42:13.112 --> 01:42:15.372]  And when we come back, we're going to briefly talk to Ted.
[01:42:15.652 --> 01:42:17.073]  Ted, that is now your new anthem.
[01:42:17.113 --> 01:42:18.774]  Do you like your new music, your new ballad?
[01:42:22.015 --> 01:42:23.055]  Oh, Ted's not in the studio.
[01:42:23.075 --> 01:42:23.515]  No, I'm here.
[01:42:23.535 --> 01:42:23.855]  I'm here.
[01:42:23.895 --> 01:42:24.275]  Oh, good.
[01:42:24.315 --> 01:42:25.296]  I want to know where to go then.
[01:42:25.676 --> 01:42:26.136]  Yeah, I know.
[01:42:26.196 --> 01:42:27.617]  I just ran into the studio.
[01:42:27.657 --> 01:42:28.457]  I just got caught up.
[01:42:29.025 --> 01:42:30.906]  Getting the last prices on gold and silver.
[01:42:30.926 --> 01:42:31.527]  Give me the gold!
[01:42:31.947 --> 01:42:33.088]  Yeah, right now it's at $736.40.
[01:42:33.328 --> 01:42:35.529]  Right now the silver's at $957.
[01:42:35.629 --> 01:42:37.350]  I want the gold!
[01:42:37.751 --> 01:42:41.693]  Yeah, we did run into some maple leaves here, so let's talk about that right after the break.
[01:42:41.713 --> 01:42:42.634]  I definitely want that gold.
[01:42:42.654 --> 01:42:44.835]  Alright, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:42:44.855 --> 01:42:49.899]  Having some fun here at the end of the show today with Ted Anderson, the little gold bug.
[01:42:49.919 --> 01:42:51.880]  He's not a leprechaun, though.
[01:42:51.900 --> 01:42:53.161]  He's a little gold goblin.
[01:42:53.919 --> 01:42:55.961]  Well, they're digging around for the gold.
[01:42:56.241 --> 01:42:57.102]  We got the gold.
[01:42:57.562 --> 01:42:59.143]  We'll be right back with Mr. Gold.
[01:43:01.926 --> 01:43:02.266]  Hello.
[01:43:02.786 --> 01:43:03.767]  I'm Steve Schenck.
[01:43:04.268 --> 01:43:07.290]  We're entering a holiday season never before seen in America.
[01:43:07.751 --> 01:43:16.158]  We're thankful for the warning given by members of Mr. Obama's campaign team of the coming international incident, which will force unpopular decisions.
[01:43:16.578 --> 01:43:22.363]  Without this warning, many of us who still have money available would have unknowingly wasted it on Christmas gifts
[01:43:23.097 --> 01:43:23.437]  I'm good to go.
[01:43:47.159 --> 01:43:48.881]  Christmas is life itself.
[01:43:49.222 --> 01:43:51.184]  Food for these unknown times.
[01:43:51.525 --> 01:43:52.986]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com 800-409-5633
[01:44:00.902 --> 01:44:13.625]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:44:14.045 --> 01:44:20.807]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[01:44:21.167 --> 01:44:24.729]  And the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:44:25.109 --> 01:44:28.310]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[01:44:28.531 --> 01:44:36.034]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.
[01:44:36.414 --> 01:44:41.617]  Secure your copy of Loose Change Final Cut today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:44:41.817 --> 01:44:50.101]  While you're visiting the online video store, be sure to check out the huge discounts on films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, America, Freedom to Fascism,
[01:44:50.421 --> 01:44:51.002]  We're good to go.
[01:45:00.507 --> 01:45:05.111]  Phase One of the Insiders' plan for a One World Government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[01:45:05.431 --> 01:45:10.455]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis... Say, come in with that music!
[01:45:10.676 --> 01:45:12.617]  ...and a new World Bank to act as savior.
[01:45:12.878 --> 01:45:14.279]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[01:45:14.499 --> 01:45:18.382]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[01:45:18.642 --> 01:45:22.225]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[01:45:22.486 --> 01:45:26.569]  The Insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[01:45:26.969 --> 01:45:28.911]  Phase One is a One World Currency.
[01:45:29.071 --> 01:45:30.935]  Which we are currently being prepared to accept.
[01:45:30.955 --> 01:45:32.619]  Phase 2 of their insidious plan.
[01:45:36.442 --> 01:45:37.423]  That's right.
[01:46:16.085 --> 01:46:20.209]  Uh, you wanna know?
[01:46:20.369 --> 01:46:22.371]  Bring in the leprechaun, Ted Anderson.
[01:46:23.872 --> 01:46:25.053]  I'm a leprechaun now.
[01:46:26.294 --> 01:46:28.376]  I'm the only Swedish leprechaun out there, I think.
[01:46:33.738 --> 01:46:35.800]  All right, Ted, you've got some great deals.
[01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:37.281]  Tell them about the group of coins you've got.
[01:46:37.621 --> 01:46:40.023]  Folks, you're insane if you don't give Minus Resources a call.
[01:46:40.303 --> 01:46:45.386]  They'll be there past midnight tonight, taking your orders on AM and FM, so pick this show up later.
[01:46:45.667 --> 01:46:47.868]  And if you don't get it from Ted Anderson, get it from somebody else.
[01:46:48.349 --> 01:46:49.689]  But believe me, check out the prices.
[01:46:49.709 --> 01:46:50.670]  These are some good deals.
[01:46:51.090 --> 01:46:53.092]  So, Mr. Leprechaun, tell us all about it.
[01:46:53.172 --> 01:46:54.313]  Yeah, of course we will.
[01:46:54.333 --> 01:46:57.515]  You know, right now I have an $11 discount on Franks.
[01:46:57.575 --> 01:47:00.317]  They're the one-fifth of an ounce gold coin.
[01:47:00.337 --> 01:47:00.557]  They're $1.87.
[01:47:02.193 --> 01:47:05.474]  I was trading those $11 higher here just last week.
[01:47:05.874 --> 01:47:07.935]  Gold is up, not down since then.
[01:47:08.455 --> 01:47:10.575]  And then I also have the British Sovereign.
[01:47:10.936 --> 01:47:14.477]  And that coin right now is close to $22 less than what it was.
[01:47:14.937 --> 01:47:16.157]  And again, gold was up.
[01:47:16.337 --> 01:47:17.277]  These are at $228.
[01:47:17.938 --> 01:47:20.398]  So another great buy to be getting into.
[01:47:20.518 --> 01:47:22.439]  And you asked me about those Maple Leafs earlier.
[01:47:23.274 --> 01:47:26.237]  I can't believe that Maple Leafs are in short supply.
[01:47:26.257 --> 01:47:31.301]  They never were before, but of course, with the markets doing what they're doing, now they're in short supply.
[01:47:31.361 --> 01:47:32.041]  I do have 50.
[01:47:33.282 --> 01:47:33.863]  Maximum 50.
[01:47:34.083 --> 01:47:38.707]  I have those right now at $8.95, and that's going to go first come, first serve.
[01:47:39.727 --> 01:47:42.470]  We didn't talk yesterday about the Walking Liberty halves.
[01:47:43.130 --> 01:47:48.655]  I got to tell people out there, I mean, silver dollars right now, Alex, are trading just under $25 a coin.
[01:47:51.555 --> 01:47:55.558]  And yet, Walking Liberty halves right now you can get for $8.40.
[01:47:56.479 --> 01:48:01.063]  The Walking Liberty half has half the amount of silver that the silver dollar has.
[01:48:02.143 --> 01:48:05.887]  Obviously, the futures market is not reflecting the physical market right now.
[01:48:06.067 --> 01:48:07.088]  Everybody knows that.
[01:48:07.528 --> 01:48:09.810]  And there's plenty of trouble right now.
[01:48:10.210 --> 01:48:12.772]  Look at what's going to happen here now with General Motors.
[01:48:13.393 --> 01:48:14.213]  Absolutely, folks.
[01:48:14.233 --> 01:48:15.675]  This is a buying opportunity.
[01:48:16.235 --> 01:48:17.336]  It's already hard to get gold.
[01:48:17.376 --> 01:48:19.458]  Most places are sold out or have huge premiums.
[01:48:20.238 --> 01:48:24.582]  Don't wait until it doubles or triples, which a lot of analysts are saying it could.
[01:48:24.642 --> 01:48:32.288]  Regardless, gold and silver will always have intrinsic value, so this is a very important insurance policy, and Ted has fabulous prices.
[01:48:32.988 --> 01:48:38.673]  We're talking $50 below what it's selling for now when he got positions on these gold coins.
[01:48:39.273 --> 01:48:41.495]  Now, I still think the Franks and the Sovereigns are great deals.
[01:48:41.515 --> 01:48:42.556]  Give folks the numbers on those.
[01:48:42.856 --> 01:48:48.099]  Yeah, right now, again, they're $187 for the Frank, and the Sovereign right now is $228.
[01:48:48.599 --> 01:48:55.482]  And think about it, I mean, when the poop hits the fan, I don't want to have a kid's show here, you know?
[01:48:55.822 --> 01:48:56.763]  I've got families listening.
[01:48:56.843 --> 01:48:57.843]  This is a kid's show.
[01:48:57.983 --> 01:48:59.484]  Yeah, right, it's a kid's show.
[01:48:59.524 --> 01:49:00.344]  Here comes Mr. Rogers.
[01:49:01.766 --> 01:49:07.415]  Well, anyways, the Frank is a small piece of gold, and you need to have small pieces of gold to trade for items.
[01:49:07.916 --> 01:49:09.138]  Items of gold and silver, you know?
[01:49:09.178 --> 01:49:10.740]  I mean, yeah, silver and gold.
[01:49:10.781 --> 01:49:11.542]  What time of year is this?
[01:49:11.963 --> 01:49:14.046]  Well, anyways, yeah, the British Sovereign...
[01:49:16.183 --> 01:49:16.504]  Hey, 800-686-2237.
[01:49:17.864 --> 01:49:20.726]  The British Stalwarts are great.
[01:49:20.746 --> 01:49:26.510]  They have the ugly witch on them, but they're accepted worldwide by people because it's the imperial prostitute.
[01:49:26.790 --> 01:49:28.331]  So, 800, the imperial great whore.
[01:49:28.351 --> 01:49:28.391]  800-686-2237.
[01:49:28.411 --> 01:49:30.713]  Well, I only disrespect the Queen.
[01:49:33.715 --> 01:49:36.477]  Well, if you want something that looks pretty, get the $10 Indian.
[01:49:36.517 --> 01:49:38.578]  I mean, that coin is just absolutely gorgeous.
[01:49:38.658 --> 01:49:42.981]  Designed by Augustus Saint-Gauden, a sculptor hired by Teddy Roosevelt.
[01:49:43.001 --> 01:49:44.582]  800-686-2237.
[01:49:45.103 --> 01:49:46.103]  Folks, the brokers are there.
[01:49:46.363 --> 01:49:48.745]  They have a wide selection of coins at different prices.
[01:49:49.165 --> 01:49:49.886]  All great deals.
[01:49:49.966 --> 01:49:51.727]  I recommend the Imperial...
[01:49:53.268 --> 01:49:53.969]  Which bag?
[01:49:54.309 --> 01:49:56.872]  Sovereign and the European Frankies.
[01:49:57.633 --> 01:49:57.873]  But 800-686-2237.
[01:49:58.053 --> 01:50:02.118]  They have those Maple Leafs right now.
[01:50:02.138 --> 01:50:03.339]  Nobody else can get those.
[01:50:03.740 --> 01:50:04.681]  They have Eagles.
[01:50:04.741 --> 01:50:05.562]  They have Gold Eagles.
[01:50:06.643 --> 01:50:08.024]  What, those are the half-ouncers, Ted?
[01:50:08.164 --> 01:50:09.566]  Yeah, half-ouncers and full-ouncers.
[01:50:09.586 --> 01:50:10.167]  You get them both.
[01:50:10.327 --> 01:50:10.667]  Oh, really?
[01:50:10.687 --> 01:50:11.188]  I mean, folks...
[01:50:11.548 --> 01:50:12.789]  Again, they got the gold.
[01:50:13.229 --> 01:50:14.190]  Nobody else has got it.
[01:50:14.670 --> 01:50:15.671]  Check around.
