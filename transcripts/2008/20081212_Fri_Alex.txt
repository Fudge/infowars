[00:00:05.593 --> 00:00:09.515]  We're good to go.
[00:00:31.061 --> 00:00:31.782]  All right, folks.
[00:00:31.842 --> 00:00:33.423]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:33.443 --> 00:00:35.944]  This is the Maiden Voyage in our new studios.
[00:00:36.024 --> 00:00:43.649]  Next week, I'm going to go around the studio with a camera and show you the TV studios we're building, the radio studios we put together, and everything we're doing here.
[00:00:43.669 --> 00:00:50.534]  And I want to commend my team with everything else we've been doing, with a very limited staff already doing the job of a hundred people.
[00:00:52.314 --> 00:00:52.374]  I'm
[00:01:07.228 --> 00:01:22.444]  Right now we're streaming over PrisonPlanet.tv for the viewers and of course people listening on the web at InfoWars.com and then later today we'll post this file up on PrisonPlanet.tv for everybody and we're gonna expand the show.
[00:01:22.464 --> 00:01:28.591]  I'm gonna be able to put up maps on the screen with a pad where I can you know draw and you know
[00:01:28.891 --> 00:01:39.618]  Get into geopolitical issues or where I can show documents on screen and circle key subsections so you can be seeing what I'm seeing when I'm on the radio, when I'm on TV, what I'm covering.
[00:01:40.118 --> 00:01:45.202]  In the future we're going to load most of the top stories into the computer where we can put those on screen for you as well.
[00:01:45.942 --> 00:01:50.285]  Like, if I cover this article right here out of Bloomberg today, I won't just be holding it up and showing it to you.
[00:01:50.546 --> 00:01:51.666]  We'll put it up on screen.
[00:01:52.227 --> 00:01:55.109]  Fed refuses to disclose recipients of $2 trillion in lending.
[00:01:55.469 --> 00:02:01.134]  Now, it's $8.5 trillion now, but when the lawsuit was filed five, six weeks ago, it was only $2 trillion that had been stolen.
[00:02:01.734 --> 00:02:03.596]  And they won't even answer questions on that.
[00:02:03.616 --> 00:02:11.382]  So in the future, we'll be posting that up on screen for you as well, and then I can circle key comments and key statements that are in the article.
[00:02:12.222 --> 00:02:19.125]  Also, we have a story here I want to go over today, some with everybody, and that is out of the Financial Times of London.
[00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:23.788]  And it says, Manila reports Ebola virus in pigs in Manila.
[00:02:23.828 --> 00:02:27.930]  Now, this is a huge issue because the Philippines produces its own pork.
[00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.432]  They bring in their breeding stock out of Europe and out of the United States.
[00:02:32.912 --> 00:02:34.793]  They haven't brought any pigs in from Africa.
[00:02:35.493 --> 00:02:41.174]  And of course, this has always been something that humans would contract and some other primates like monkeys and apes.
[00:02:41.835 --> 00:02:53.978]  Now, we've seen a lot of the eugenicists saying they're hoping for an airborne Ebola to kill humans and wipe out 90% of the world's population against everybody.
[00:02:54.318 --> 00:02:59.099]  So we're going to be going over this report for everybody as well.
[00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:05.526]  Because this is just coming out of nowhere and the last time we saw this type of
[00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:32.334]  situation break out on the farm uh... breakout in agriculture it was in england in two thousand when the british government admits that someone inside the organization uh... got a level four bioweapons lab and uh... went out as a road and spread it all over the country and they killed a four million cows eight million sheep and decimated many of the farms and uh... cheaper uh...
[00:03:33.394 --> 00:03:34.474]  A production facilities.
[00:03:34.955 --> 00:03:38.656]  And so we look to the government again carrying this out.
[00:03:38.696 --> 00:03:42.277]  We know that Ebola was a biological weapon developed back in the 60s.
[00:03:42.417 --> 00:03:47.318]  It popped up by United Nations and World Health Organization and U.S.
[00:03:47.358 --> 00:03:52.520]  weapons labs in Africa and is clearly a bioweapon being tested for depopulation measures.
[00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.801]  And to have this show up in pigs is just off the charts insane.
[00:03:57.261 --> 00:04:01.203]  So we'll be going over some of that report for you today as well.
[00:04:02.463 --> 00:04:07.806]  We're also waiting for Aaron Dykes to arrive back or to call in.
[00:04:07.846 --> 00:04:09.126]  In fact, bring Rob in here.
[00:04:09.186 --> 00:04:10.947]  Rob was the last person to talk to Aaron.
[00:04:12.728 --> 00:04:21.172]  As part of NORTHCOM and the Army and the Marines conditioning the public to accept armed troops on the streets, they're sending troops into the schools to brainwash the children.
[00:04:21.592 --> 00:04:27.115]  They are running checkpoints around the country and they're going out to automobile accidents helping people in wrecks.
[00:04:27.535 --> 00:04:27.675]  I think?
[00:04:44.321 --> 00:05:07.490]  Who has done some reports for us in the past and the Marines got on the phone with me and the sergeant on air knew who I was but then wouldn't talk to me anymore and then they went and told security outside the Toys R Us in a parking lot with radio stations out there doing promos so it was supposedly a public event to kick him off the property so we sent Aaron and Derek
[00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.552]  up there a few hours ago to see what was happening and we have not heard back from them yet.
[00:05:12.592 --> 00:05:16.533]  Hope they weren't arrested for daring to ask questions in America.
[00:05:17.254 --> 00:05:29.558]  Also, speaking of the military, Secretary of Defense Gates last week in the Associated Press put out a PR piece saying, yes, we're hiring a lot of foreigners and bringing them in to be part of the military.
[00:05:29.578 --> 00:05:36.021]  But they spun it and said it's for linguists and for people to be able to protect the homeland.
[00:05:36.781 --> 00:05:37.822]  And that's a cover story.
[00:05:37.882 --> 00:05:38.743]  Certainly that's part of it.
[00:05:39.063 --> 00:05:42.925]  The main force is illegal aliens that they're legalizing.
[00:05:42.985 --> 00:05:47.288]  The largest army recruiting center, Marine Corps recruiting centers, are no longer in the United States.
[00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:55.594]  They are in the Manila, Philippines, speaking of Manila, and of course in Mexico City, Ukraine, and places along those lines.
[00:05:55.634 --> 00:05:57.555]  So with the classical tyranny of a
[00:05:58.556 --> 00:06:03.779]  A government that wants to oppress its people, bringing in foreign troops, and then integrating them into the total force.
[00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:12.743]  And I'm seeing this propaganda everywhere, without even looking for it on the news, on television, in newspapers, about how we need to have foreigners to make up our force.
[00:06:13.103 --> 00:06:21.027]  And I saw this in the Austin Chronicle, which is more propagandistic than even the daily Austin American Statesman.
[00:06:21.587 --> 00:06:26.690]  And it talks about this wonderful Palestinian man, and just how great he is,
[00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.811]  And how he was not a U.S.
[00:06:29.851 --> 00:06:33.392]  citizen, but after he joined the military they allowed him to become a U.S.
[00:06:33.432 --> 00:06:33.812]  citizen.
[00:06:34.092 --> 00:06:38.413]  So lots of PR humanizing the fact that our military is being made up of foreigners.
[00:06:38.753 --> 00:06:39.854]  Am I against somebody who's a U.S.
[00:06:39.894 --> 00:06:40.274]  citizen?
[00:06:40.594 --> 00:06:47.116]  Who lives here, who's Palestinian, or who's German, or who is Ukrainian, or British being part of our military?
[00:06:47.616 --> 00:06:47.776]  No.
[00:06:48.396 --> 00:06:51.918]  But the point is, is that they're doing it when they're not legal U.S.
[00:06:51.938 --> 00:06:52.438]  citizens.
[00:06:52.458 --> 00:07:00.981]  They're giving them green cards, they're taking illegal aliens and giving them green cards, and then after a few years of service, they're giving them, basically as mercenaries, U.S.
[00:07:01.001 --> 00:07:08.885]  citizenship, and they're propagandizing the public, conditioning the public, that all of this is acceptable, and that all of this is a great thing.
[00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.213]  And so, they're easing it into the public.
[00:07:12.233 --> 00:07:14.376]  You know, we always wondered, how would they hire the foreign troops?
[00:07:14.977 --> 00:07:18.381]  A decade ago, plus, when the Pentagon said they wanted to use foreign troops against the American people.
[00:07:19.343 --> 00:07:20.544]  And now we're seeing how they're doing it.
[00:07:21.105 --> 00:07:27.333]  Also, earlier this year, back in January of 2008, the Toronto Star and other papers reported
[00:07:28.234 --> 00:07:40.770]  That a secret deal was signed by the United States, Canada, and Mexico to use each other's troops, to use Mexican and American troops in Canada, to use Canadian and Mexican troops in the United States, to use Canadian and U.S.
[00:07:40.811 --> 00:07:46.057]  troops in Mexico for terrorism and, quote, to defend the homeland.
[00:07:46.738 --> 00:07:54.166]  And we also see an Associated Press article reporting that they're hiring illegal aliens to work as police officers in police departments.
[00:07:54.686 --> 00:07:57.469]  So, Stalin brought in foreigners to oppress people.
[00:07:57.489 --> 00:08:00.212]  The British brought in foreigners to oppress the colonies.
[00:08:01.013 --> 00:08:02.415]  This is seen over and over again.
[00:08:02.435 --> 00:08:04.537]  And then you also have the hundreds of thousands of mercenaries.
[00:08:04.817 --> 00:08:07.600]  No longer Blackwater USA, it's now Blackwater Worldwide.
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.242]  They're international in scope.
[00:08:09.642 --> 00:08:11.363]  They're signing weird deals with the Vatican.
[00:08:11.664 --> 00:08:14.166]  They are to patrol the streets of America.
[00:08:14.406 --> 00:08:15.887]  They've also been in the L.A.
[00:08:15.927 --> 00:08:20.430]  Times, photographed raiding medical marijuana facilities.
[00:08:20.971 --> 00:08:23.253]  So we're also seeing Blackwater involved in that.
[00:08:23.273 --> 00:08:25.474]  A lot of really serious, bizarre behavior.
[00:08:25.955 --> 00:08:37.384]  And of all places, Bill Moyer's program a few months ago on PBS had guests on talking about Israeli troops, Blackwater and Mexican troops.
[00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:53.261]  uh... and uh... other foreign troops that were in new orleans taking part into the operations in the gun confiscation i mean this is all really happening and as if that that isn't bad enough i learned twelve years ago that out of the minimum security federal prison
[00:08:54.449 --> 00:09:04.693]  In Bastrop, Texas, just outside of Austin, that they were hiring people to join the military, commuting their sentences, if they would join the military.
[00:09:05.213 --> 00:09:12.276]  Now the Washington Times, the Associated Press have reported since then that actually there's a huge program recruiting violent, aggravated felons.
[00:09:12.296 --> 00:09:15.497]  An aggravated felon means something violent.
[00:09:15.777 --> 00:09:17.698]  Rape, robbery, armed robbery.
[00:09:18.579 --> 00:09:21.062]  In fact, the news has listed they're hiring arsonists.
[00:09:21.703 --> 00:09:24.726]  They're hiring a rapist for the military.
[00:09:24.766 --> 00:09:33.196]  So they're bringing in a pack of rogues, huge throngs of foreigners to carry out all of these operations.
[00:09:34.197 --> 00:09:38.640]  I do want to give out the toll-free number if you're watching at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:45.923]  We're also going to put that up on screen for people that are watching PrisonPlanet.tv, the toll-free number to call in.
[00:09:45.943 --> 00:09:56.789]  But if you're listening on the InfoWars and PrisonPlanet.com free audio streams that are there of this show, let me give it out to you verbally, audibly, so you can hear it, not just on the screen.
[00:09:56.809 --> 00:09:57.089]  888-201-2244.
[00:09:57.109 --> 00:09:57.149]  888-201-2244.
[00:10:03.332 --> 00:10:05.733]  We're going to open those phone lines up in just a moment.
[00:10:05.773 --> 00:10:12.515]  We can just open the computer system up to take calls and literally 20, 30, 40 will come in in seconds.
[00:10:13.215 --> 00:10:17.437]  In the past when we've done special audio reports and PrisonPlanet.tv pieces,
[00:10:19.255 --> 00:10:21.218]  separate from being hooked up to Genesis.
[00:10:21.258 --> 00:10:32.714]  Now, of course, starting next Monday, I am going to be live in studio here for the full four hours, and several hours of that will be live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:10:33.455 --> 00:10:35.998]  And all of that is a beta test
[00:10:36.699 --> 00:10:37.200]  I don't know.
[00:10:59.241 --> 00:10:59.401]  I don't
[00:11:15.264 --> 00:11:20.446]  As a depression instituted and orchestrated by the federal government.
[00:11:20.466 --> 00:11:29.190]  So again, 888-201-2244 and PrisonPlanet.tv viewers can see that live right now on their screen.
[00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:33.291]  Incidentally, we are running a special 5 plus months free.
[00:11:33.311 --> 00:11:36.492]  It comes up to 5.3 months free when you get a yearly membership and pay for 6.7 months.
[00:11:36.513 --> 00:11:38.553]  You pay for 6.7 months, you get 5.3 months free at Prison Planet.
[00:11:43.115 --> 00:12:11.533]  uh... dot tv and uh... you can share that with uh... several people and the passcode will still works we hope that you get some membership and then give that to others also all twenty one of my films all of my other special reports these tv reports everything is posted at prison planet dot tv easily downloaded and burned a desk to share with others and basically every subject uh... that uh... you can imagine is posted uh... op uh... on prison planet dot tv it's four and a half years up and running
[00:12:12.313 --> 00:12:19.837]  I guess since April of 2003, so quite a long time that we have been doing that.
[00:12:19.897 --> 00:12:27.841]  But here is the Austin Chronicle telling us how great the foreigners are who were not citizens and put in the military.
[00:12:27.861 --> 00:12:31.323]  And then once they prove themselves, they get to become citizens again.
[00:12:31.323 --> 00:12:32.524]  Again, all sounds romantic.
[00:12:32.804 --> 00:12:38.649]  It's being pitched simultaneously in every major newspaper we see, all part of a PR propaganda campaign.
[00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:53.821]  Now, this may not be paid for by the government, but I had a guest on last week reporting from Congress that billions of dollars in fake news and propaganda are paid for each year and put in newspapers, TV and radio, and the public is never told about that.
[00:12:53.881 --> 00:13:00.867]  It's clearly a unified propaganda push, and then other newspapers kind of parrot it and pick it up, I guess not knowing they're part of that, so we don't know what the Chronicle
[00:13:01.227 --> 00:13:01.767]  Translating the War.
[00:13:20.985 --> 00:13:24.286]  And how great it is that we have all these foreigners making up our military.
[00:13:25.146 --> 00:13:32.668]  So just absolutely incredible to see this happening.
[00:13:34.549 --> 00:13:37.670]  You can go read that report for yourself if you live in Austin.
[00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:38.750]  This is a free newspaper.
[00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:40.731]  It's going to the Dallas Observer.
[00:13:41.656 --> 00:13:44.359]  The San Francisco has a weekly paper.
[00:13:44.439 --> 00:13:45.280]  It's very, very popular.
[00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:46.741]  But again, I'm seeing this everywhere.
[00:13:47.642 --> 00:14:00.635]  In other propaganda, I was in the gas station last night getting some gas, and I noticed that at quite a few gas stations lately I've been seeing this flyer, or similar flyers, and it says, Stop Child Abuse.
[00:14:00.655 --> 00:14:02.857]  We're going to show you a little bit closer shot of that.
[00:14:03.298 --> 00:14:04.779]  Stop Child Abuse.
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.963]  And over a million children a year are taken from their parents and growing.
[00:14:08.983 --> 00:14:12.206]  There are federal bounties on children's heads.
[00:14:12.607 --> 00:14:23.818]  The federal government admits, the Justice Department admits, and it's also been a Newsweek cover story, that in government custody, in foster care control, children are five times more likely to be abused or die
[00:14:24.198 --> 00:14:25.680]  Than anyone else.
[00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:32.327]  So I wonder why they're not putting out brochures everywhere about stopping government child abuse when they're the biggest offender.
[00:14:32.367 --> 00:14:34.689]  And how horrible it is and how terrible it is.
[00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:46.042]  I wonder why there aren't flyers about the Texas Youth Commission caught by the Texas Rangers selling the children in their custody into prostitution in the prison facilities.
[00:14:46.682 --> 00:15:14.099]  uh... and uh... why that got swept under the rug don't know about it google texas youth commission uh... and what's happening to the children there and there are all these private adoption agencies in these churches in these big institutions hundreds of thousands of dollars every child they get adopted out uh... huge government contracts uh... some of the owners of these that i've seen in in just this texas state budget uh... some of the directors of these things are making millions of dollars a year apiece and so what happens is
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:22.967]  Now, you hear about a child in front of witnesses falling off a jungle gym, and they take them to the hospital and the CPS comes and takes them.
[00:15:23.367 --> 00:15:35.757]  Or you hear about everybody who has their child in Head Start now, that's considered government welfare under eugenics, and they get three CPS visits to the home, the public doesn't know they can refuse it, and they come in and find dirty dishes or something and take their children.
[00:15:36.678 --> 00:15:41.923]  They are now taking people's children if they're not basically obese, they're also taking people's children if they are obese.
[00:15:43.043 --> 00:15:43.663]  I don't think so.
[00:15:58.869 --> 00:16:04.391]  And so the special family courts were set up to decide whether you'd be sterilized to find out if you were even allowed to have children.
[00:16:04.671 --> 00:16:09.393]  And they took a lot of the children of poor families and institutionalized them and did chemical and biological testing on them.
[00:16:09.713 --> 00:16:11.374]  Am I saying there aren't some good orphanages?
[00:16:11.434 --> 00:16:14.935]  Am I saying that there aren't some good foster parents out there?
[00:16:15.155 --> 00:16:15.836]  Certainly there are.
[00:16:16.036 --> 00:16:21.238]  But the system itself is predatory and violates due process and abuses many more children than they help.
[00:16:22.478 --> 00:16:25.340]  The state will not investigate these orphanages.
[00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.581]  The state will not engage in oversight.
[00:16:27.801 --> 00:16:30.642]  They will not investigate all the tens of thousands of deaths every year.
[00:16:31.863 --> 00:16:34.204]  The children locked up and starved to death in cages.
[00:16:34.925 --> 00:16:39.727]  Just a few days ago in California, a kid bust loose, all beaten and bloody with a chain on his leg.
[00:16:40.068 --> 00:16:40.908]  They go and bust him.
[00:16:41.308 --> 00:16:43.349]  And I said, you watch, it's going to be foster parents.
[00:16:43.389 --> 00:16:43.950]  Well, it was.
[00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:47.912]  A foster parent had sold them to the pedophiles.
[00:16:47.972 --> 00:16:49.793]  And I, by the way, predicted this on air and it came out.
[00:16:50.093 --> 00:16:51.194]  Because I've seen it a million times.
[00:16:52.779 --> 00:16:58.863]  Because every time they said that he'd been in foster care, but it had run away, and I said, no, you watch.
[00:16:59.444 --> 00:17:01.165]  They sold him, because that's what they do.
[00:17:01.665 --> 00:17:07.149]  You see, foster care has the highest turnover of any state or federal job.
[00:17:08.365 --> 00:17:10.648]  Okay, the CPS workers have the highest turnover.
[00:17:10.688 --> 00:17:11.108]  It's more than 50%.
[00:17:11.309 --> 00:17:12.390]  You can pull that up.
[00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:12.970]  More than 50%.
[00:17:13.651 --> 00:17:14.292]  Why is that?
[00:17:14.873 --> 00:17:19.218]  Because moral people think they're going to go help children that are being neglected or beaten or tortured or hurt.
[00:17:19.678 --> 00:17:22.442]  They get in and they find out that it's two other groups in there.
[00:17:22.722 --> 00:17:25.685]  The sociopaths that just want the bounties on every child they kidnap.
[00:17:26.676 --> 00:17:44.839]  And the big corrupt orphanages and organizations that get federal money for drugging the kids and their special needs, or if it's a healthy baby, you know, you're getting $200,000, $300,000, $400,000, on average about $200,000, but sometimes $500,000 in fees, especially if it's blonde hair, blue eyed, that's on record, that that's what happens.
[00:17:45.848 --> 00:17:58.035]  So, I wanted to talk about the fact that the government will not investigate itself, and so that's why all of this is so ripe for abuse.
[00:17:58.676 --> 00:18:02.918]  And that's why we're seeing such incredible, abhorrent things happening.
[00:18:03.679 --> 00:18:08.682]  But if you pull up the California case, just type in California case, shackled boy.
[00:18:09.929 --> 00:18:25.052]  And then you go back, I guess it came out about a week ago, the day it happened I said, folks, they say he ran away from foster parents, watch, I bet you a million bucks, I said this on air, when we get more staff I'm going to have him waiting and whenever I say something pulling it up and playing it on air from when I said it the week before.
[00:18:25.352 --> 00:18:37.094]  And it came out this weekend, it was in the newspapers in California, that indeed the foster parents had basically done some transaction and sold this child out to him.
[00:18:38.723 --> 00:18:46.069]  Remember, four years ago in Florida, it came out that 3,500 plus children were missing out of foster care.
[00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:49.773]  And they kept finding them dead, kept finding them tortured, kept finding them in other states.
[00:18:50.153 --> 00:19:00.482]  They were being sold, and then when a child disappears, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10 years old, there's no Amber Alert, there's no National Alert, they just say, we don't know where the child is or they're a runaway.
[00:19:01.707 --> 00:19:06.497]  And then, nine times out of ten, they're being sold by the foster parents to pedophile rinks.
[00:19:06.878 --> 00:19:09.864]  So why do you have this massive 50 plus percent turnover?
[00:19:11.072 --> 00:19:23.978]  What's happening is good people get in and go, my God, I was here really to help children, and then they leave, and then it's only the pedophiles that are one group, and I don't know what percentage that is, but it's admitted the highest percentage of pedophiles out there are truancy officers, CPS workers.
[00:19:24.238 --> 00:19:26.659]  They're constantly getting caught, and that's in basic criminology.
[00:19:26.679 --> 00:19:34.283]  If you go take that at a major university or pull up those crime statistics, you hear about all the time teachers and foster care workers raping kids, and they finally do get caught because they'll do it publicly.
[00:19:34.303 --> 00:19:36.224]  It's in the news every day, but they're trying to downplay it.
[00:19:37.216 --> 00:19:40.717]  Or they'll say a parent rapes their child, and you read the fine print, foster parent.
[00:19:41.097 --> 00:19:42.278]  Nine times out of ten, literally.
[00:19:42.978 --> 00:19:44.598]  I mean, just check this out for yourself.
[00:19:44.658 --> 00:19:45.579]  This is unbelievable.
[00:19:45.839 --> 00:19:52.461]  So there's the sociopaths that just want the money, the headhunters, that want the federal and state money, the bounty on children, and there is one.
[00:19:53.602 --> 00:19:59.004]  Or it's the pedophiles, and that's all that's left in the foster care situation.
[00:19:59.044 --> 00:20:05.127]  So this is the total dehumanization that we are talking about here.
[00:20:06.007 --> 00:20:13.210]  So I don't know about STRAY, a children at heart ministry helping life's darkest hours.
[00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:15.651]  I don't know if it's a good, bad, or indifferent organization.
[00:20:16.892 --> 00:20:22.440]  But let me tell you, the nomenclature that they have here does not sound good in any way.
[00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:29.391]  So let me just read this to you, then I'm going to cover the Ebola in pigs, which is just unbelievable in the Philippines.
[00:20:29.811 --> 00:20:31.514]  And then, I guess I didn't think about this.
[00:20:32.515 --> 00:20:33.796]  I can look over here and get my caller.
[00:20:33.876 --> 00:20:39.060]  Soon we're going to have a laptop in here or a built-in system so I can more readily check that out.
[00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:40.401]  But I see your calls coming in.
[00:20:40.781 --> 00:20:47.186]  Sherry in Texas, Tim in Houston, Chris in Tampa, Leo in Mass, JT in Colorado, and many, many others.
[00:20:47.206 --> 00:20:48.847]  So your calls are coming up.
[00:20:48.907 --> 00:20:50.088]  But let me just read this.
[00:20:50.289 --> 00:20:51.610]  Now imagine, you've got all these do-gooders.
[00:20:52.350 --> 00:21:01.755]  Reading CPS billboards about stop-abuse children, in between the billboards saying report illegal guns, that show a picture of a revolver, so that everybody thinks revolvers are illegal when they're not.
[00:21:01.795 --> 00:21:04.036]  See, this is all brainwashing, using your tax money.
[00:21:04.236 --> 00:21:06.897]  Half the billboards I see in Texas now are government propaganda.
[00:21:06.917 --> 00:21:09.738]  It's like we live in North Korea or something on that front.
[00:21:09.758 --> 00:21:15.041]  I mean, that's not a free society when half the billboards are government propaganda about tattle on your neighbor, spy on your neighbor.
[00:21:16.172 --> 00:21:19.556]  Now listen to this, there's no excuse for child abuse.
[00:21:20.377 --> 00:21:24.962]  Each year there are tens of thousands of confirmed cases of child abuse or neglect in Texas.
[00:21:25.603 --> 00:21:28.707]  Tens of thousands of confirmed, but there's no due process, there's no jury.
[00:21:30.609 --> 00:21:35.494]  Just these eugenics courts set up 80 years ago, 90 years ago, depending on what state,
[00:21:36.633 --> 00:21:40.454]  Who had the power to just grab you off the street with no jury or anything and just sterilize you.
[00:21:40.874 --> 00:21:42.695]  That's what the family courts were founded for.
[00:21:43.215 --> 00:21:44.275]  And they're not due process.
[00:21:44.295 --> 00:21:45.676]  They're extra constitutional.
[00:21:45.936 --> 00:21:48.977]  They're outside the purview of checks and balances, the Constitution Bill of Rights.
[00:21:49.737 --> 00:21:51.637]  And people say, well, how does that happen with the Constitution Bill of Rights?
[00:21:52.037 --> 00:21:53.218]  Well, you have to enforce that.
[00:21:53.698 --> 00:21:57.299]  You know, black people weren't considered human and they could be lynched for no reason.
[00:21:59.161 --> 00:22:01.303]  They weren't allowed to own guns when everybody else was.
[00:22:02.063 --> 00:22:05.106]  That was against the Constitution, but people had to stand up and demand their rights.
[00:22:05.426 --> 00:22:10.650]  So that's why we have these criminal, predatory courts where the judges even get part of the money of seized children.
[00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:16.774]  Each year there are tens of thousands of confirmed cases, you mean in your kangaroo court, of child abuse or neglect in Texas.
[00:22:17.515 --> 00:22:20.077]  This includes emotional, physical, or sexual abuse.
[00:22:20.097 --> 00:22:23.600]  Now, there's no law saying you can't scream at your children when they run out the street.
[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:25.741]  There's no law saying that.
[00:22:26.322 --> 00:22:27.463]  But they will take your children
[00:22:28.243 --> 00:22:45.549]  If you don't know your rights and don't defend yourself, and they're teaching the public, and they teach you here, if somebody screams at a child, now the government can taser a five-year-old, and the teachers can scream at you, and the cops can scream at you, but parents can't say, no, stay away from that space heater, or no, you do not go in the street, I've told you!
[00:22:46.749 --> 00:22:50.851]  By the way, it's not illegal to spank your child, but they still seize children for that.
[00:22:52.711 --> 00:22:57.293]  This includes emotional, emotional, physical or sexual abuse,
[00:22:58.564 --> 00:23:03.788]  Pain that no child should be forced to endure until they get in government-controlled hands and they're five times more likely.
[00:23:03.808 --> 00:23:06.449]  Until they get locked up in a cage and fed one hot dog a day.
[00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:12.333]  By the way, the government has ruled, you can pull this up, that foster parents are allowed to cage children.
[00:23:12.553 --> 00:23:16.436]  But if you cage your child, which I'm not for, you get in trouble.
[00:23:17.036 --> 00:23:19.078]  So they warehouse them, they cage them, they get money for them.
[00:23:19.278 --> 00:23:20.799]  And they get more when they put them on drugs.
[00:23:21.059 --> 00:23:26.643]  That's why more than two-thirds of American foster children are on, on average, seven psychotropic drugs.
[00:23:28.032 --> 00:23:29.875]  Pain that no child should be forced to endure.
[00:23:30.356 --> 00:23:32.259]  It is pain that can last a lifetime.
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:37.007]  In Williamson and Travis County, thousands of cases of child abuse or neglect are investigated each year.
[00:23:37.268 --> 00:23:39.271]  Confirmed cases leave innocent children victimized.
[00:23:40.117 --> 00:23:41.598]  Scarred and emotionally damaged.
[00:23:42.259 --> 00:23:45.822]  Abuse and neglect does not simply affect one child or one family.
[00:23:46.263 --> 00:23:47.744]  It is felt in schools, neighborhoods, and communities.
[00:23:48.104 --> 00:23:51.927]  Most frequently, the cycle of child abuse can repeat itself in families, generation after generation after generation.
[00:23:51.947 --> 00:23:53.989]  See, this is the state coming in and taking over families.
[00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:57.272]  We can stop child abuse, but children can't always speak for themselves.
[00:23:57.632 --> 00:23:59.054]  Sometimes we have to speak for them.
[00:23:59.714 --> 00:24:03.678]  Now, let's hear what they say could be signs of abuse.
[00:24:04.619 --> 00:24:05.800]  The child's being bad.
[00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:07.101]  School, gotta be taken.
[00:24:08.103 --> 00:24:17.888]  The first step in helping an abused or neglected child, or a child that's drunk a bunch of Coca-Cola, is to recognize the symptoms and signs of abuse, whether it's neglect or physical, sexual or emotional abuse.
[00:24:18.168 --> 00:24:19.789]  Here are some of the signs you should look for.
[00:24:20.129 --> 00:24:24.071]  A child shows signs of malnutrition, or begs or hoards food.
[00:24:25.912 --> 00:24:29.014]  Really, my kids are pretty plump, but they're always begging for sweet treats.
[00:24:29.534 --> 00:24:30.455]  Sorry, gotta take them.
[00:24:31.414 --> 00:24:32.174]  Poor hygiene!
[00:24:32.615 --> 00:24:40.639]  You see, if a child wipes their nose at school, on their shirt, and they see that snot, a little bit of snot, that's in the CPS manuals.
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.180]  Kid's gone.
[00:24:43.341 --> 00:24:46.423]  You turn them over to them, they get snot on their face, gone.
[00:24:48.464 --> 00:24:49.985]  I've been there, I've seen them take kids for this.
[00:24:52.106 --> 00:24:52.607]  Unattended.
[00:24:53.587 --> 00:24:55.167]  Physical or mental problems?
[00:24:55.568 --> 00:24:58.288]  Well, they say everything's a mental problem now, and they threaten parents all the time.
[00:24:58.568 --> 00:25:08.131]  The school aren't doctors, but they say, you put your child on Prozac, you put them on Ritalin, they don't tell them, stop giving them soft drinks, or the school shouldn't be giving them Cokes and sweets and all the stuff that makes them crash.
[00:25:09.572 --> 00:25:10.532]  Nutrition's all of it.
[00:25:11.392 --> 00:25:17.034]  Oh, they say, you don't put your child on Ritalin, we're going to take them, and they do it every day across the nation.
[00:25:17.972 --> 00:25:19.917]  See how they disguise all this psychological warfare.
[00:25:20.157 --> 00:25:25.891]  The child shows signs of malnutrition or begs or hoards for food, poor hygiene, unintended physical or mental problems.
[00:25:30.023 --> 00:25:31.164]  So that's anything they want.
[00:25:31.725 --> 00:25:34.167]  The parent or caregiver abuses drugs or alcohol.
[00:25:34.207 --> 00:25:35.027]  See, they don't tell you.
[00:25:35.728 --> 00:25:36.389]  You go in.
[00:25:36.789 --> 00:25:37.670]  They're now doing this.
[00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:38.551]  I've seen the news reports.
[00:25:38.891 --> 00:25:42.014]  And they ask you, hey, are you a drinker before you have this surgery on your gallbladder?
[00:25:42.314 --> 00:25:43.735]  Yeah, I drink a few beers every night.
[00:25:43.755 --> 00:25:47.558]  I remember one case, they took the guy's kids because he said, yeah, I drink a six pack every night.
[00:25:47.919 --> 00:25:48.399]  No logging.
[00:25:48.419 --> 00:25:48.960]  Took his kids!
[00:25:51.642 --> 00:25:54.885]  And see, it was all, no judge, no jury, none of these did it.
[00:25:57.858 --> 00:25:59.700]  I guess it was a kangaroo judge, but no jury.
[00:26:00.461 --> 00:26:02.023]  Unexplained bruises, burns, or welts.
[00:26:02.043 --> 00:26:06.287]  I mean, my children are constantly running around outside.
[00:26:06.307 --> 00:26:09.191]  They're constantly, you know, getting bruises and things.
[00:26:09.391 --> 00:26:13.515]  And they go to the government training camp.
[00:26:13.595 --> 00:26:14.396]  They're there watching.
[00:26:14.416 --> 00:26:15.157]  They're there looking.
[00:26:15.197 --> 00:26:17.240]  They're there, you know, seeing what's happening.
[00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:19.062]  Looking for an excuse.
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:23.185]  A child is frightened of a parent.
[00:26:23.766 --> 00:26:32.704]  Well, I mean, a child, if they've been caught doing something bad, and you say, you know, you've been bad, and the child goes like that, oh, that's it, not allowed.
[00:26:36.656 --> 00:26:39.457]  Inappropriate knowledge about sex or age-inappropriate play.
[00:26:39.777 --> 00:26:44.600]  See, they put sex all over TV, all over mainstream news, all over commercials.
[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:46.380]  It's all over the society.
[00:26:47.001 --> 00:26:48.381]  And children do all this stuff naturally.
[00:26:48.421 --> 00:26:50.462]  They can never see anything and they're going to try to play doctor.
[00:26:50.882 --> 00:26:52.163]  That's basic child psychology.
[00:26:52.203 --> 00:26:52.663]  Go take it.
[00:26:52.923 --> 00:26:55.604]  I took a course in that in school, in college.
[00:26:55.784 --> 00:26:56.565]  It's right there.
[00:26:56.585 --> 00:26:57.145]  It doesn't matter.
[00:26:57.405 --> 00:26:59.266]  You see, oh, that's another reason to get them.
[00:26:59.826 --> 00:27:00.947]  Extreme mood swings.
[00:27:02.298 --> 00:27:07.104]  You got kids on Ritalin and Prozac with it, or you got kids on all the sugar and dyes and toxins and GMOs.
[00:27:07.845 --> 00:27:09.226]  That's basically every kid in America.
[00:27:09.246 --> 00:27:10.708]  So now, boy, that kid's throwing a fit.
[00:27:11.249 --> 00:27:12.510]  I better call the police on him.
[00:27:13.451 --> 00:27:16.953]  Oh man, and all the time, every time I talk to these parents, I'm like, well how did this happen?
[00:27:17.313 --> 00:27:35.602]  Well, my children, my five and six year old, were playing in the backyard on Saturday, and I was watching them out of the window, and it's a fenced backyard, and that night the CPS showed up and demanded to come in the house and said they'd arrest me if I didn't sign a paper, but the paper said that I agreed that I was abusive, I didn't know that, and then they took them, and it's been a year since I saw my children.
[00:27:36.883 --> 00:27:38.444]  No due process, it's just all made up.
[00:27:39.381 --> 00:27:49.887]  So, I want to get Children at Heart Ministries on the show, and I want to... Oh, and then it also lectures the parents.
[00:27:49.927 --> 00:27:51.068]  See, the parents are bad.
[00:27:51.108 --> 00:27:55.931]  The state and their cohorts are five times more likely, and they're the ones with the bad record of hurting people.
[00:27:56.271 --> 00:27:59.573]  The state, and the government, and their minions, and those profiting from this.
[00:27:59.613 --> 00:28:01.954]  But they're also going to have the moral high ground.
[00:28:01.974 --> 00:28:02.935]  They're going to tell you you're bad.
[00:28:03.155 --> 00:28:03.895]  Parents are bad.
[00:28:04.616 --> 00:28:05.036]  You're evil.
[00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:09.661]  Children need to know that they are special, loving, capable of following their dreams.
[00:28:10.762 --> 00:28:12.102]  Help a friend, neighbor, or relative.
[00:28:12.162 --> 00:28:12.903]  Offer a helping hand.
[00:28:12.943 --> 00:28:15.644]  Take care of the children so the parents can rest or spend time together.
[00:28:15.884 --> 00:28:19.925]  See, now this tells you to spy on everybody and then it goes, go get in everybody's business right here.
[00:28:21.146 --> 00:28:26.948]  Help yourself when the big and little problems of your everyday life pile up on you to the point where you feel overwhelmed and out of control.
[00:28:26.988 --> 00:28:27.528]  Take time out.
[00:28:27.588 --> 00:28:28.608]  Don't take it out on your child.
[00:28:28.668 --> 00:28:30.229]  See, they're telling you you're abusive.
[00:28:30.749 --> 00:28:32.310]  Somebody reads this and they go, my God!
[00:28:33.339 --> 00:28:37.323]  You know, my children get scared of me when I yell at them for running on the street.
[00:28:37.983 --> 00:28:41.306]  Or, my gosh, my kids have mood swings, which is a normal part of life.
[00:28:41.366 --> 00:28:42.067]  I must be bad.
[00:28:42.267 --> 00:28:44.810]  See, they tell 13-year-old girls now and boys, oh, you're feeling upset.
[00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:49.534]  You're feeling, you know, all these feelings.
[00:28:50.795 --> 00:28:51.936]  You need Prozac and Ritalin.
[00:28:52.357 --> 00:28:54.579]  See how they're telling you there's something wrong with you.
[00:28:55.299 --> 00:28:56.300]  Be a nurturing parent.
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:58.042]  Help a friend, neighbor, or relative.
[00:28:58.322 --> 00:28:58.983]  Help yourself.
[00:29:00.472 --> 00:29:01.112]  Get involved.
[00:29:01.192 --> 00:29:06.034]  Ask your community leaders, clergy, library and schools to develop services to meet the needs of healthy children and families.
[00:29:06.454 --> 00:29:09.995]  Now that's because most of the 26,000 churches are under FEMA secret control.
[00:29:10.035 --> 00:29:11.476]  We got you the documents, it's now in the news.
[00:29:11.756 --> 00:29:17.678]  Training for gun confiscation, going to FEMA camps, training parents, that's in the documents, to turn loose of their parents to go to FEMA camps.
[00:29:17.978 --> 00:29:22.720]  So that's so you go ask to be part of what most of these government controlled churches are already involved in.
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:25.801]  Volunteer at a local child abuse prevention program.
[00:29:27.776 --> 00:29:33.020]  And then this is to get you to be a volunteer spy for information about volunteer opportunities.
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:36.562]  Report suspected child abuse or neglect.
[00:29:37.583 --> 00:29:38.783]  And all the time they take children.
[00:29:38.803 --> 00:29:40.745]  The neighbor, a little old lady, went to one of these training seminars.
[00:29:41.705 --> 00:29:42.306]  I saw him.
[00:29:42.406 --> 00:29:42.746]  Yes.
[00:29:43.226 --> 00:29:47.989]  She pulled out to the mailbox and got out of the car while her children were in it.
[00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:49.410]  And the car was running.
[00:29:49.691 --> 00:29:50.551]  Thank you so much.
[00:29:50.571 --> 00:29:52.933]  We need you to file that report with us online.
[00:29:52.953 --> 00:29:53.993]  We'll be there tomorrow.
[00:29:55.735 --> 00:29:56.055]  Boom.
[00:29:56.095 --> 00:29:56.655]  Kids are gone.
[00:29:56.795 --> 00:29:57.416]  See it all the time.
[00:29:59.184 --> 00:30:03.230]  Oh yes, your child slips out of their car seat as you pull up to the house.
[00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:04.571]  Cops are waiting, they take them.
[00:30:04.591 --> 00:30:05.913]  We've had Austin cases of that.
[00:30:09.673 --> 00:30:11.774]  They see you run in the house for a minute.
[00:30:12.614 --> 00:30:18.455]  They see your child run out to your car when you pull up with a t-shirt on when it's cold weather.
[00:30:18.615 --> 00:30:19.435]  Your children are gone.
[00:30:20.076 --> 00:30:21.976]  By the way, you think I'm joking, don't you?
[00:30:22.256 --> 00:30:23.857]  I study this every day.
[00:30:24.377 --> 00:30:25.757]  I know what's going on.
[00:30:26.337 --> 00:30:27.838]  I understand what we're dealing with.
[00:30:28.158 --> 00:30:29.718]  I'm not kidding about this.
[00:30:30.758 --> 00:30:33.579]  Just type into Google, child dies in foster care.
[00:30:34.785 --> 00:30:39.347]  And you'll see hundreds of articles from just in your town, your city, your county.
[00:30:40.348 --> 00:30:44.570]  And then, you know, type in, child dies in foster care Austin, Texas.
[00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:47.572]  Child dies in foster care Albuquerque, New Mexico.
[00:30:47.872 --> 00:30:50.033]  Child dies in foster care Oklahoma City.
[00:30:50.233 --> 00:30:52.254]  Sometimes you'll get two or three articles a day.
[00:30:55.256 --> 00:30:59.478]  Because this is an industry for lazy pieces of trash who warehouse these children.
[00:30:59.518 --> 00:31:01.939]  Listen, I worked for one summer as a carpet cleaner.
[00:31:04.167 --> 00:31:17.015]  Back in 1993, no, 1994, I worked as a carpet cleaner at Stanley Steamer Carpet Cleaner.
[00:31:17.875 --> 00:31:21.117]  And let me tell you, you see something when you work for a carpet cleaner.
[00:31:22.018 --> 00:31:27.481]  And we go in houses with cat piss everywhere and dog crap everywhere and fleas jumping all over your legs.
[00:31:28.161 --> 00:31:30.403]  But it paid so much, like twenty-something bucks an hour back then.
[00:31:30.423 --> 00:31:33.305]  That was like, whoa, because you've got to pay people to do that work.
[00:31:34.281 --> 00:31:38.546]  And I remember I'd go into these houses and you'd always smell marijuana.
[00:31:38.786 --> 00:31:40.188]  You'd see whiskey bottles and stuff.
[00:31:40.208 --> 00:31:46.375]  There'd be some drugged out looking guy laying in front of the couch, in front of the TV on the couch.
[00:31:46.855 --> 00:31:48.056]  And you'd be going to the rooms.
[00:31:50.659 --> 00:31:51.600]  This is so incredible.
[00:31:52.791 --> 00:31:54.492]  And there'd be all these children there.
[00:31:54.592 --> 00:31:56.153]  They'd be 5, they'd be 8, they'd be 10.
[00:31:56.453 --> 00:31:58.194]  They'd look all skinny and scared.
[00:31:58.214 --> 00:32:01.556]  Sometimes they'd be in their underwear and they'd crawl kind of up in a corner.
[00:32:02.217 --> 00:32:03.737]  And I was like, what the hell is this?
[00:32:03.757 --> 00:32:06.499]  It's like everything in my life has trained me for now what I'm doing.
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:09.341]  And it was always... I'm like, what is this place?
[00:32:10.484 --> 00:32:11.604]  I'm a foster parent.
[00:32:11.624 --> 00:32:16.767]  There'd be pot seeds in a, you know, a can with the lid half, you know, not even hiding their pot.
[00:32:17.187 --> 00:32:17.767]  And you know why?
[00:32:17.787 --> 00:32:18.667]  Because they're untouchable.
[00:32:18.687 --> 00:32:20.168]  The cops won't come there for their pot.
[00:32:20.508 --> 00:32:24.630]  They can do whatever they want to the children because the government doesn't want to report on itself.
[00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:26.090]  They are above the law.
[00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:29.492]  And I saw that over and over and over again.
[00:32:29.532 --> 00:32:34.294]  You'd be in a house with cat piss, with fleas, and it'd be foster children.
[00:32:35.074 --> 00:32:39.896]  Always mattresses on the floor, wads of dirty stuff or stinking diapers.
[00:32:41.249 --> 00:32:45.170]  And sometimes these would be an upper middle class series.
[00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:46.770]  This might be a five, six bedroom house.
[00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:48.590]  There'd be a pool right out back.
[00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:58.652]  Because the lazy, slob, foster parents warehouse kids, and then if they can say they've got psychological problems, they get thousands more to take care of a special needs.
[00:32:58.892 --> 00:33:04.993]  So they get healthy, normal kids that were kidnapped from their parents, they put them on drugs, and now it's a special needs child so they get even more money.
[00:33:05.193 --> 00:33:07.894]  So they can lay on the couch taking drugs all day watching Oprah.
[00:33:08.905 --> 00:33:15.811]  Now I'm telling you, I'm telling you, anybody who's worked in service has seen this, and that's why I quit that job after just a few months.
[00:33:16.652 --> 00:33:24.459]  It's because I was tired of going, not just that, it was other houses with, the worst thing was cat piss, the way it smells.
[00:33:24.819 --> 00:33:26.821]  But the point is, is that I couldn't handle it.
[00:33:28.743 --> 00:33:33.667]  And I don't know, I probably was in ten houses, I don't know, probably more than that, with the foster care.
[00:33:34.108 --> 00:33:35.089]  And you'd see these kids just...
[00:33:36.513 --> 00:33:37.994]  Just hiding all skinny.
[00:33:38.414 --> 00:33:39.974]  And that's the government just squeezing them.
[00:33:39.994 --> 00:33:41.175]  We'll do what we want to you!
[00:33:41.195 --> 00:33:42.675]  We'll get the money!
[00:33:42.695 --> 00:33:44.596]  And there's nothing you can do!
[00:33:44.716 --> 00:33:47.978]  Our evil goes on and on and on and on and on and on.
[00:33:51.199 --> 00:33:57.661]  So, why doesn't this group, why doesn't this church group or whatever it is, why doesn't it go put out brochures about government abuse?
[00:33:57.842 --> 00:34:01.483]  And about stopping the Texas Youth Commission and all the things they're doing.
[00:34:01.643 --> 00:34:04.844]  And about stopping the real threat and menace to children.
[00:34:05.245 --> 00:34:06.125]  I want to see that.
[00:34:08.372 --> 00:34:13.716]  I'm just going to look at the screen over here and see what the set looks like.
[00:34:14.057 --> 00:34:15.057]  And it's going to get even better in here.
[00:34:15.077 --> 00:34:19.861]  We've got another little set over here with a blue curtain set up for interviews.
[00:34:20.301 --> 00:34:21.342]  We've got an area in here.
[00:34:24.825 --> 00:34:29.949]  You know, why don't you rotate around the room a little bit while I'm talking with this camera over here.
[00:34:30.009 --> 00:34:33.952]  Kind of pan around and show people some of the stuff going on in here.
[00:34:35.816 --> 00:34:40.677]  It's already first broadcast in here and I'm already littering everywhere.
[00:34:40.717 --> 00:34:41.357]  Oh, that's bad.
[00:34:41.417 --> 00:34:44.118]  Did you know for papers on a desk they take your children?
[00:34:44.338 --> 00:34:44.898]  Oh, you don't believe me?
[00:34:44.918 --> 00:34:45.698]  Go read the handbooks.
[00:34:46.178 --> 00:34:47.759]  I'm not, you can't make this up!
[00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:58.821]  You can't make up 8.5 trillion stolen in seven weeks and the Federal Reserve tells Congress and Bloomberg, suing them, that we're not going to tell you where the money went when they promised and swore it would all be transparent.
[00:35:00.945 --> 00:35:02.046]  Zoom in on this bad boy.
[00:35:02.086 --> 00:35:03.146]  Zoom in on Bloomberg.
[00:35:04.127 --> 00:35:07.549]  Fed refuses to disclose recipients of $2 trillion.
[00:35:07.769 --> 00:35:09.610]  But that's the lawsuit from five weeks ago again.
[00:35:10.511 --> 00:35:13.152]  It's now $8.5 trillion, according to the news.
[00:35:15.854 --> 00:35:16.234]  Look at that.
[00:35:19.796 --> 00:35:21.497]  Fed refuses.
[00:35:21.517 --> 00:35:26.020]  Is that as much as it zooms in?
[00:35:28.208 --> 00:35:29.009]  There we go.
[00:35:29.149 --> 00:35:29.609]  Yeah.
[00:35:29.749 --> 00:35:31.611]  Fed refuses to disclose.
[00:35:31.631 --> 00:35:33.333]  We've got a lot of robotic settings for these two.
[00:35:33.353 --> 00:35:40.959]  I'm going to mount a robotic camera on the ceiling, and then it's going to have presets on places on my desk with a light over it, so I can just, boom, lay it down and you'll see it.
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:42.721]  We can scroll over news articles.
[00:35:43.081 --> 00:35:48.606]  Now, again, it's 8.5 now, but when they filed their suit, it was $2 trillion.
[00:35:50.047 --> 00:35:51.729]  So the suit's over the $2 trillion missing.
[00:35:53.322 --> 00:35:54.582]  But it's 8.5 trillion.
[00:35:55.582 --> 00:36:00.603]  In fact, just Google 8.5 trillion, bailout now 8.5 trillion, and put that up on screen.
[00:36:00.643 --> 00:36:01.243]  Let's test that.
[00:36:01.264 --> 00:36:02.324]  I wanted to see that.
[00:36:03.044 --> 00:36:04.784]  San Francisco Chronicle is the first one that comes up.
[00:36:04.824 --> 00:36:05.644]  Pull that up for folks.
[00:36:07.105 --> 00:36:11.405]  By the way, I've got all these old videos of CPS kidnapping kids in Austin.
[00:36:11.425 --> 00:36:12.966]  We would go and try to expose what they were doing.
[00:36:12.986 --> 00:36:17.407]  But I had to quit doing it about five years ago, going to the hospital when an innocent family had done nothing.
[00:36:17.967 --> 00:36:19.227]  But, you know, they...
[00:36:21.496 --> 00:36:24.539]  You know, the mother had a marijuana conviction from 10 years before.
[00:36:24.659 --> 00:36:25.320]  They run that now.
[00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:26.461]  And they say, well, that's at risk.
[00:36:26.701 --> 00:36:27.562]  And the mother's crying.
[00:36:27.602 --> 00:36:28.643]  It's a blonde-haired, blue-eyed baby.
[00:36:28.683 --> 00:36:30.725]  There's special cops there to take the child.
[00:36:30.785 --> 00:36:31.085]  It's worth $500,000.
[00:36:31.746 --> 00:36:35.710]  And again, the hospitals also kill you to take your organs.
[00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:39.433]  They also kill you to get your corneas.
[00:36:39.694 --> 00:36:40.294]  Oh, don't believe me?
[00:36:40.514 --> 00:36:41.455]  In fact, Google that.
[00:36:41.535 --> 00:36:43.918]  Google hospital steel corneas.
[00:36:47.162 --> 00:36:48.203]  These are run by criminals.
[00:36:49.083 --> 00:36:52.084]  Criminality is now in control of almost everything.
[00:36:53.125 --> 00:36:54.886]  In positions of power, we have to counter them.
[00:36:55.226 --> 00:36:55.946]  Google both those.
[00:36:55.966 --> 00:36:57.047]  8.5, bailout now 8.5 trillion.
[00:37:01.129 --> 00:37:07.053]  And then Google, hospitals stealing organs, or hospitals stealing corneas.
[00:37:07.453 --> 00:37:11.655]  But they don't just take it if you haven't signed an organ donor card, and then zip you back up.
[00:37:11.715 --> 00:37:18.059]  They are people coming in who have good brain waves, but who are badly hurt, and they won't render aid.
[00:37:18.079 --> 00:37:19.140]  That's coming out in 60 minutes.
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:20.581]  And they will kill you.
[00:37:21.141 --> 00:37:23.663]  They will murder you for your organs.
[00:37:23.703 --> 00:37:26.805]  See, that's how corrupt things are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:27.853 --> 00:37:32.817]  So we're going to put that up on screen for everybody that is out there.
[00:37:32.857 --> 00:37:35.959]  Fed refuses to disclose recipients of $2 trillion.
[00:37:36.719 --> 00:37:39.842]  Okay, let me show folks a close-up of this article.
[00:37:41.343 --> 00:37:56.614]  This is out of the Financial Times of London, and it is an Ebola outbreak in pigs in the Philippines.
[00:37:59.045 --> 00:38:00.886]  Now, what do you think about that?
[00:38:00.966 --> 00:38:05.689]  Manila reports Ebola virus in pigs.
[00:38:05.769 --> 00:38:12.392]  Now, again, I want to go over why this is such a big deal, and then I'm going to take some of your phone calls.
[00:38:12.452 --> 00:38:18.536]  Hell, I may just start doing the whole four-hour show live, because then I can just show everybody what I'm talking about.
[00:38:18.896 --> 00:38:22.658]  You know, last week, no, I guess Monday,
[00:38:23.979 --> 00:38:35.811]  I get up on air and I'm reading, and now for World Government, Financial Times of London headlines saying, World Government's tyrannical, it's been secretly set up, by the way, it's a good thing, the editor of the Financial Times is a Bilderberg Group member, we've covered that, Mr. Wolf.
[00:38:36.912 --> 00:38:39.936]  And people called me and emailed and said, you're lying, it doesn't say that.
[00:38:39.996 --> 00:38:41.998]  It didn't matter, hundreds of other papers are now announcing it.
[00:38:43.371 --> 00:38:46.093]  Now, I can show this on the video.
[00:38:46.133 --> 00:38:49.715]  Now, I know those saying it on the YouTube comments everywhere are liars, they're government operatives.
[00:38:50.115 --> 00:38:55.518]  I understand they're COINTELPRO and that's been admitted, that they've hired tens of thousands of paid bloggers, that's been in the news as part of the fake news.
[00:38:56.019 --> 00:38:59.561]  But they're playing on weak people's minds, believing I'm making this up.
[00:38:59.881 --> 00:39:05.404]  So now it won't just be people grabbing my audio and putting it on YouTube, they'll grab this off prisonplanet.tv and put it up in everything I say.
[00:39:06.845 --> 00:39:11.288]  Everything I say will be right there for them.
[00:39:12.679 --> 00:39:16.382]  Now that is Steve Watson's, or Paul Joseph Watson's article about it.
[00:39:16.742 --> 00:39:21.045]  Click on the first link in the story, because people won't believe PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:39:21.706 --> 00:39:23.167]  Click on the San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:39:23.207 --> 00:39:23.708]  There you go.
[00:39:23.728 --> 00:39:25.749]  Ah!
[00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:28.271]  Oh, this is going to crush the enemy right here.
[00:39:28.511 --> 00:39:29.452]  I tell you, I can't wait.
[00:39:29.772 --> 00:39:31.433]  I'm so sick of people denying everything.
[00:39:31.674 --> 00:39:34.436]  I can show them bills where it says troops on the streets to take our guns.
[00:39:34.756 --> 00:39:35.977]  I can show them all the documents.
[00:39:36.017 --> 00:39:37.018]  I can show them everything!
[00:39:38.257 --> 00:39:42.681]  I can show them all the crime statistics about government being the most abusive, hurting children.
[00:39:43.301 --> 00:39:44.803]  I can show everybody everything.
[00:39:46.745 --> 00:39:46.925]  Oh!
[00:39:48.046 --> 00:39:49.527]  Kathleen Pender.
[00:39:49.947 --> 00:39:50.888]  San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:39:50.928 --> 00:39:52.950]  Government bailout hits 8.5.
[00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:53.931]  Trill.
[00:39:54.812 --> 00:39:59.055]  Now, have you guys found the one about them stealing corneas?
[00:40:00.497 --> 00:40:02.118]  Hospitals steal corneas.
[00:40:02.739 --> 00:40:04.100]  Hospitals steal organs.
[00:40:08.402 --> 00:40:09.303]  I want them to see it.
[00:40:09.783 --> 00:40:10.464]  They'll deny it.
[00:40:11.946 --> 00:40:19.653]  Right now they've got children, millions of them, just raping them, torturing them, doing whatever they want, hoping you don't fight them, hoping you don't have the will to face what they've done.
[00:40:20.994 --> 00:40:21.795]  Why am I fired up?
[00:40:21.815 --> 00:40:23.977]  You're supposed to get fired up about people hurting children!
[00:40:25.038 --> 00:40:29.362]  I don't get fired up about the stupid horns, the stupid football, the stupid cowboys.
[00:40:29.563 --> 00:40:30.604]  I care about liberty!
[00:40:31.224 --> 00:40:32.866]  And I'm waging war on corruption!
[00:40:37.182 --> 00:40:39.904]  Manila reports Ebola virus in pigs.
[00:40:41.366 --> 00:40:45.269]  Did you guys find the organ story yet?
[00:40:49.593 --> 00:40:50.794]  I mean, how can you not find that?
[00:40:50.834 --> 00:40:52.996]  It's been in scores of papers I've seen.
[00:40:53.016 --> 00:40:55.078]  They caught Austin Hospital stealing them a few years ago.
[00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:58.320]  Problem is, it scrolls down.
[00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:01.581]  Okay, I guess I'll do it here.
[00:41:01.641 --> 00:41:02.122]  Here, hold on.
[00:41:02.322 --> 00:41:04.862]  Before I get into Manila, I'll just go ahead and do this for people.
[00:41:05.483 --> 00:41:07.643]  They'll get to see me misspelling here how bad I did that.
[00:41:07.943 --> 00:41:10.424]  Google has totally ruined my spelling, because I can just halfway spell it.
[00:41:11.204 --> 00:41:11.585]  Let me see.
[00:41:11.705 --> 00:41:22.568]  Cornea... Hoss... Fiddles... Steel... It's all gone off the computer.
[00:41:26.061 --> 00:41:26.361]  Corneas.
[00:41:26.381 --> 00:41:27.202]  How do you spell corneas?
[00:41:29.644 --> 00:41:33.466]  There you go.
[00:41:33.506 --> 00:41:33.967]  Oh, look at this!
[00:41:34.467 --> 00:41:34.987]  This is one.
[00:41:35.047 --> 00:41:39.290]  Columbian Hospital did not steal children's corneas.
[00:41:39.350 --> 00:41:42.152]  Italy's Hospital of Horrors Fears of Cornea Trafficking.
[00:41:43.033 --> 00:41:43.933]  Veteran Hospital.
[00:41:43.953 --> 00:41:45.815]  There's a bunch of articles here about corneas stealing.
[00:41:45.835 --> 00:41:46.936]  Let me click on News.
[00:41:46.956 --> 00:41:48.877]  I guess it hasn't been in the news lately because it's not up there.
[00:41:51.759 --> 00:41:54.561]  This is all about worldwide people having their corneas stolen.
[00:41:55.729 --> 00:42:01.172]  I know I've seen it in the news probably, you know, not 500 times, probably only 200 times or something.
[00:42:01.572 --> 00:42:02.633]  Let me just type Austin.
[00:42:02.653 --> 00:42:12.479]  I remember a few years ago they got some... Former coordinator admits stealing from University of Kentucky, I. Establishing a cornea bank.
[00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:17.802]  How about hospitals steal patients' corneas?
[00:42:17.822 --> 00:42:18.042]  That'll...
[00:42:24.215 --> 00:42:24.575]  Points?
[00:42:24.735 --> 00:42:25.476]  That's not what I said.
[00:42:25.536 --> 00:42:26.617]  Oh, I combined the two words.
[00:42:27.517 --> 00:42:28.338]  How do you spell patience?
[00:42:33.501 --> 00:42:35.342]  I can't believe you guys won't find this stuff for me.
[00:42:35.362 --> 00:42:36.143]  I've got to do it on air.
[00:42:36.163 --> 00:42:39.285]  I need to get Aaron in here.
[00:42:39.305 --> 00:42:40.005]  He's really good at it.
[00:42:43.267 --> 00:42:45.709]  Well, the point is, for Monday's show, I'm going to find a bunch of those.
[00:42:45.729 --> 00:42:46.649]  I'm going to put them up on screen.
[00:42:47.129 --> 00:42:48.871]  Or maybe while callers are talking, I can find them.
[00:42:48.911 --> 00:42:50.952]  I found some in other countries where they're doing it.
[00:42:53.874 --> 00:42:55.434]  Hospital Steel Corneas.
[00:42:57.175 --> 00:43:06.177]  The problem with the web is, if something's a couple years old... Ah, it's driving me crazy.
[00:43:06.337 --> 00:43:08.898]  Official Steel and Trade Organs from Executed Criminals.
[00:43:10.078 --> 00:43:10.878]  Ah, that's Asia.
[00:43:12.599 --> 00:43:15.179]  Italy's Hospital of Horrors, Corning and Trafficking.
[00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:20.220]  Boy, they have really gotten this a-sponged off of here.
[00:43:20.241 --> 00:43:20.761]  Well, it doesn't matter.
[00:43:20.801 --> 00:43:21.101]  It's up there.
[00:43:21.121 --> 00:43:22.041]  People can find it if they want.
[00:43:23.103 --> 00:43:28.507]  Workers in the country's morgues are stealing eyes to sell to private hospitals, where healthy cornea costs now $3,000.
[00:43:28.548 --> 00:43:32.050]  Well, yeah, there it is.
[00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:33.271]  That's out of the BBC.
[00:43:34.192 --> 00:43:34.973]  Anyways, doesn't matter.
[00:43:34.993 --> 00:43:36.234]  The point is, that's going on too.
[00:43:38.035 --> 00:43:39.436]  Let's punch this up on screen.
[00:43:39.477 --> 00:43:41.558]  Manila reports Ebola virus in pigs.
[00:43:41.598 --> 00:43:43.480]  Let's put that up on screen for people.
[00:43:45.461 --> 00:43:46.983]  Philippine officials
[00:43:49.517 --> 00:44:07.015]  Tucked into servings of luncheon, the popular dish of roasted whole pig in front of a television camera on Thursday to reassure the public of the safety of the nation's staple meat after discovery among hogs near Manila of a strain of Ebola virus.
[00:44:11.445 --> 00:44:12.446]  Click on the original link.
[00:44:12.466 --> 00:44:14.708]  I don't want to put up a Free Republic sub-link.
[00:44:14.728 --> 00:44:16.209]  People will deny that article even exists.
[00:44:16.229 --> 00:44:18.751]  If you click on the original link, it'll be Financial Times of London.
[00:44:19.172 --> 00:44:20.553]  See the link at the top, the red link?
[00:44:21.394 --> 00:44:22.895]  That'll take you to the original article.
[00:44:26.238 --> 00:44:26.698]  Arthur Yep.
[00:44:28.422 --> 00:44:42.921]  Agriculture Secretary and Francisco Duque Health Secretary said the Ebola Reston virus, which had never been found in pigs before, presented a low health risk for humans and was different from the deadly African variety.
[00:44:43.814 --> 00:44:49.782]  The World Health Organization was reportedly to be looking into whether there was any chance that humans could have become infected.
[00:44:49.802 --> 00:44:54.008]  The outbreak could deal a blow to the Philippines' plans to build a pork export industry.
[00:44:54.028 --> 00:45:01.298]  The government halted the inaugural shipment of frozen pork to Singapore and quarantined three swine farms, pork vendors and
[00:46:26.257 --> 00:46:26.677]  Immediately.
[00:46:26.917 --> 00:46:31.841]  Let me just make that executive decision to send this back and get the next... I guess we'll buy a more expensive unit.
[00:46:32.842 --> 00:46:39.406]  This thing was over $20,000, brand new, but that's about the cheapest unit there is out there, and the stupid thing is not working.
[00:46:40.026 --> 00:46:40.947]  What's the name of this product?
[00:46:40.967 --> 00:46:42.148]  I want to put its name out for everybody.
[00:46:42.428 --> 00:46:43.049]  TriCaster?
[00:46:43.669 --> 00:46:44.309]  Yeah.
[00:46:44.389 --> 00:46:45.750]  And that's why we're doing this Maiden Voyage.
[00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:51.795]  This is to be expected as we work out these bugs for everybody.
[00:46:52.816 --> 00:47:05.869]  And again, I'm going to have more focused, broadcasterly parts of the show, but they'll also be ranting and raving, and we should rant and rave about all these crazy things that are happening and going on in our society.
[00:47:11.121 --> 00:47:21.324]  And again, we are back, ladies and gentlemen, going over PrisonPlanet.tv and we are streaming over the web for everybody on the audio front as well.
[00:47:21.865 --> 00:47:25.426]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to the calls.
[00:47:25.446 --> 00:47:27.907]  I'm going to let you guys go ahead and air these calls.
[00:47:29.087 --> 00:47:30.828]  Leo and Mass, you are on the air.
[00:47:30.888 --> 00:47:31.248]  Welcome.
[00:47:32.688 --> 00:47:33.028]  Hi.
[00:47:33.328 --> 00:47:40.531]  Yeah, I was kind of hoping that we could set up a Stasi CPS reporting core nationwide so that
[00:47:41.417 --> 00:47:45.420]  When these people do these things, we get it up on YouTube and stuff like that.
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:51.965]  And also for the military, whenever they have these show things like what happened today to acclimatize people.
[00:47:51.985 --> 00:47:54.667]  You know, like meet-up groups and stuff like that.
[00:47:55.547 --> 00:47:56.148]  Absolutely.
[00:47:56.188 --> 00:48:01.391]  And speak of the devil, after your call's done, Aaron Dykes, come in here and give me a report about the troops at the end of the show.
[00:48:01.411 --> 00:48:02.712]  We'll do that, come up in about ten minutes.
[00:48:02.752 --> 00:48:03.993]  But his mic's on, he's ready to go?
[00:48:04.013 --> 00:48:05.334]  Okay, good.
[00:48:05.394 --> 00:48:08.096]  And we'll swivel that camera around on him a little bit.
[00:48:08.397 --> 00:48:09.237]  One more little point.
[00:48:10.791 --> 00:48:23.555]  I can't, I'm a member, but I can't seem to get into the Prison Planet membership so I can see it, but it would be best if you just described everything as though you were doing an audio only, and that way the people in the video can see the other stuff.
[00:48:24.236 --> 00:48:26.316]  If you program yourself to do that, you see what I'm saying?
[00:48:26.776 --> 00:48:27.617]  No, I don't understand.
[00:48:28.377 --> 00:48:31.318]  Okay, when you're doing your show,
[00:48:32.594 --> 00:48:38.396]  Program your voice to think that you're only speaking to an audio audience.
[00:48:38.816 --> 00:48:39.397]  Well, I did that.
[00:48:39.437 --> 00:48:42.558]  I mean, I'm saying, here I have the article, here's the headline, and I read it.
[00:48:44.079 --> 00:48:44.859]  Okay.
[00:48:45.099 --> 00:48:52.382]  And I say, here you can see the Palestinian, that wasn't even a citizen when he joined the military.
[00:48:52.802 --> 00:48:54.703]  And now they're conditioning us to accept foreign trips.
[00:48:58.652 --> 00:49:02.735]  Do that thing about the PBS voice, you do that?
[00:49:03.155 --> 00:49:05.737]  That is the most brilliant thing that you can do.
[00:49:05.757 --> 00:49:06.998]  Oh, when they talk like this?
[00:49:07.318 --> 00:49:08.860]  We're just enslaving you.
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:10.301]  Calm down.
[00:49:10.321 --> 00:49:13.463]  We're just taking you to the glue factory, horsey.
[00:49:13.483 --> 00:49:15.585]  It's all going to be over soon.
[00:49:15.625 --> 00:49:16.966]  We're going to kill all of you.
[00:49:17.426 --> 00:49:18.867]  We're loving and liberal.
[00:49:18.887 --> 00:49:19.968]  We know best.
[00:49:20.228 --> 00:49:20.768]  Exactly.
[00:49:20.808 --> 00:49:22.650]  Talk like you're talking to a dog, you know?
[00:49:23.743 --> 00:49:30.067]  Sometimes you may say something in a cute little voice so that he doesn't know what you're exactly saying and he thinks it's funny.
[00:49:30.107 --> 00:49:31.548]  That's what they would do stuff to.
[00:49:31.948 --> 00:49:39.233]  Well, I've asked my guys to post more prominent links on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv and the sites so you can click on and watch the live feed.
[00:49:39.253 --> 00:49:41.354]  I know people are watching the live feed, right guys?
[00:49:42.375 --> 00:49:43.776]  Because he's saying he can't get through to it.
[00:49:44.276 --> 00:49:49.039]  And this is all a test today, test transmission, so we're vetting everything, Leo.
[00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:51.241]  Tell me what happens when you try to watch the show.
[00:49:52.612 --> 00:50:00.744]  Oh, I get the signing area, and I put my specific information in, and it doesn't go through.
[00:50:00.764 --> 00:50:04.289]  So it's probably something in Windows or... I mean, I'll clear it up.
[00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:07.414]  I mean, does your PrisonPlanet.tv membership usually work for you?
[00:50:09.141 --> 00:50:09.982]  I don't even use it.
[00:50:10.002 --> 00:50:11.524]  I mean, I have enough fun listening to you.
[00:50:11.604 --> 00:50:12.104]  No, no, no.
[00:50:12.205 --> 00:50:20.374]  If you paid for a PrisonPlanet.tv membership, you, I am, you email Paul Watson at Customer Service and you get him to fix it and give you a new code, okay?
[00:50:20.875 --> 00:50:21.155]  Okay.
[00:50:21.576 --> 00:50:24.319]  Also, how did $700 billion become $8.5 trillion?
[00:50:24.339 --> 00:50:24.699]  I don't see a
[00:50:27.242 --> 00:50:28.723]  Well, I mean, I read the bill on air.
[00:50:28.803 --> 00:50:40.030]  It said unlimited power, we can never be looked at again, we become the government, and yes, and that's why the Federal Reserve is now announcing that it's going to issue the government bonds and become the government, and we will pay them.
[00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:44.693]  Sir, when you write your income tax check, it's already written to the Federal Reserve.
[00:50:44.973 --> 00:50:48.275]  They're just publicly taking over, and they're bankrupting us by design.
[00:50:48.555 --> 00:50:54.118]  We've got to, the thing is, they're not just stealing it, we've got to pay taxes back for the $8.5 trillion.
[00:50:54.358 --> 00:50:56.079]  $700 billion was just a term they gave the public.
[00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:56.640]  Thanks for the call.
[00:50:58.436 --> 00:50:59.897]  Okay, sorry, we already cut you off.
[00:51:00.518 --> 00:51:01.899]  Chris in Tampa, you're on the air.
[00:51:01.959 --> 00:51:02.580]  Go ahead, Chris.
[00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:05.022]  Really, we're doing a test show.
[00:51:05.442 --> 00:51:07.364]  I'd like to get my computer screens in front of me next time.
[00:51:07.925 --> 00:51:09.606]  This looking over my shoulder thing isn't going to work here.
[00:51:10.267 --> 00:51:13.169]  I can wear sunglasses with a mirror and I can look that way.
[00:51:13.530 --> 00:51:15.892]  Okay, go ahead, Chris in Tampa.
[00:51:16.834 --> 00:51:18.355]  The future's so bright, you gotta wear shades.
[00:51:18.955 --> 00:51:19.655]  That's right.
[00:51:20.315 --> 00:51:23.257]  This is Chris Steiner in Dunedin, Florida.
[00:51:23.277 --> 00:51:24.857]  I want to say you have a really nice set.
[00:51:25.638 --> 00:51:31.620]  Now I'm buffering a lot on PrisonPlanet.tv, but Infowars.com, that's just fine.
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:41.484]  The stream coming in through there, and I've noticed that on Firefox, sometimes I don't get your video stream through PrisonPlanet.tv, but Internet Explorer 7 always works.
[00:51:42.868 --> 00:51:47.655]  I want to let you and your guests know that this is one of the best birthday presents I've ever had.
[00:51:47.675 --> 00:51:49.017]  This is my 35th birthday.
[00:51:50.592 --> 00:51:53.054]  And I also got another surprise present for him.
[00:51:53.114 --> 00:51:58.798]  I was just invited this morning to be a guest on 1340 AM here locally.
[00:51:58.818 --> 00:52:02.681]  You can tune in, streaming Tantalk1340.com.
[00:52:02.721 --> 00:52:03.782]  That's W-T-A-N.
[00:52:04.402 --> 00:52:17.132]  And I wanted to ask you, since you're talking about Ebola and so many other diseases, maladies that come about, some super survival foods that you could do a whole show on that, like spirulina and chlorella.
[00:52:17.752 --> 00:52:21.015]  I'm glad the government is moving to ban those.
[00:52:21.035 --> 00:52:23.276]  Let's get a shot of Aaron because he's coming up in a minute.
[00:52:23.296 --> 00:52:25.518]  Let's go ahead and talk to Corey in California.
[00:52:25.578 --> 00:52:26.299]  Corey, you're on the air.
[00:52:26.339 --> 00:52:26.579]  Go ahead.
[00:52:37.427 --> 00:52:38.208]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[00:52:38.248 --> 00:52:40.010]  Congratulations on your new studio.
[00:52:40.110 --> 00:52:42.152]  Well, we're working the bugs out here, so, you know.
[00:52:42.433 --> 00:52:42.813]  Oh, yeah.
[00:52:43.133 --> 00:52:43.794]  Sure.
[00:52:44.154 --> 00:52:53.545]  I just wanted to let you know that my father called me about two days ago telling me about Indiana has just implemented the quote-unquote Big Brother program.
[00:52:55.006 --> 00:53:02.273]  Uh, you basically go in for like how you do your driver's license, and this thing takes a 360 degree scan of your skull.
[00:53:02.833 --> 00:53:11.141]  Every nook and cranny is surveyed, your hair, freckles, eye color, you can't wear hats, you can't wear your glasses, you can't wear nothing, and this thing will be able to pick you out of 100,000 people!
[00:53:13.618 --> 00:53:13.838]  Alex.
[00:53:13.858 --> 00:53:14.258]  100,000 people.
[00:53:44.058 --> 00:53:47.579]  So they take your baby's blood without a warrant, put it in a database so they can frame them later.
[00:53:48.359 --> 00:53:51.020]  Everybody 35 and under who was born in the hospital had it done.
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:52.680]  Secret federal program, now public.
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:57.821]  And I don't know about Indiana, but I knew the feds were paying the states to put in.
[00:53:58.662 --> 00:54:08.564]  And he just stuck his head in there and let the guys behind the counter scan the slave so they can now track your daddy everywhere that he goes with the defense department software they've got in the cameras.
[00:54:09.404 --> 00:54:09.744]  Oh yeah.
[00:54:10.064 --> 00:54:12.365]  Also, another thing... I mean, what does your dad think of that?
[00:54:14.475 --> 00:54:18.418]  Actually, Alex, through you, I was woken up and then he was woken up through Bob Chapman.
[00:54:18.798 --> 00:54:20.479]  And he knows exactly what's going on.
[00:54:20.499 --> 00:54:22.981]  Did he refuse?
[00:54:23.061 --> 00:54:24.122]  Is he going to sue?
[00:54:24.582 --> 00:54:29.265]  Because, I mean, this is his face, his body scan, his biometric signature.
[00:54:29.726 --> 00:54:35.590]  They've also identified you with these AI computers coming out of your house with the cameras or on the road.
[00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.491]  Let me finish.
[00:54:36.951 --> 00:54:38.572]  Or when you pay with a credit card at a store.
[00:54:38.612 --> 00:54:40.754]  Some stores are signed up to get federal money to do this.
[00:54:41.394 --> 00:54:44.658]  It then ties your name to your walk.
[00:54:44.978 --> 00:54:47.041]  But I mean, people are saying, well, how do they identify who I am on my walk?
[00:54:47.321 --> 00:54:49.684]  They identify you with cameras according to your license plate.
[00:54:49.944 --> 00:54:54.930]  When you get out of the car, they then know who you are because it's according to the license plate.
[00:54:55.251 --> 00:54:58.114]  Then it scans with the cameras your walk.
[00:54:58.835 --> 00:55:12.419]  And that's the Bob Woodward secret weapon he talked about in Iraq, is that now they can target somebody, videotape them, feed it into a computer, and then satellites can tell by your walk and your shadow from above.
[00:55:13.919 --> 00:55:15.340]  So see, that's what they've put in.
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:17.840]  That's why they've stole 8.5 trillion.
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:26.183]  They're kidnapping kids, they're taking organs in hospitals, they're murdering whoever they want, they've got a military slave grid in, and they're getting ready to really hurt everybody.
[00:55:26.223 --> 00:55:26.543]  Go ahead.
[00:55:28.341 --> 00:55:32.543]  I've actually witnessed first hand that surveillance system you're talking about.
[00:55:32.683 --> 00:55:37.244]  I actually have a friend that works for that, doesn't even know what's really going on.
[00:55:37.264 --> 00:55:38.405]  He's just like me.
[00:55:38.425 --> 00:55:40.725]  Sir, I'm a Marine.
[00:55:41.106 --> 00:55:42.086]  I'm not going to lie about it.
[00:55:42.106 --> 00:55:42.986]  So the military is using this?
[00:55:46.264 --> 00:55:51.046]  Oh yeah, but I can't really go into it, you know, this kind of secret kind of thing, I guess.
[00:55:51.406 --> 00:55:54.227]  It's not secret, it's been deployed against the enemy, the U.S.
[00:55:54.267 --> 00:55:54.507]  people.
[00:55:55.548 --> 00:55:59.909]  Well, yeah, I just don't want to kind of get into it.
[00:55:59.949 --> 00:56:01.070]  It's funny you mention Indiana.
[00:56:01.390 --> 00:56:06.892]  That's where license plate scanning and face scanning was first tested about 14 years ago in federal documents we found.
[00:56:07.192 --> 00:56:10.533]  Then next was Texas, and so those are two of the worst states.
[00:56:10.573 --> 00:56:15.055]  So is California, New York, and that's a total slave grid, and the public has no idea.
[00:56:15.805 --> 00:56:18.726]  Yeah, I didn't have any faith in the Governor of Indiana.
[00:56:18.786 --> 00:56:21.027]  I knew he'd sell us out sooner or later.
[00:56:21.327 --> 00:56:29.029]  As far as that, the whole Marines thing... What level are you in the Marines where you're... I mean, I guess you've been in combat where they're accessing this, or are they doing tests here in the U.S.
[00:56:29.049 --> 00:56:32.930]  with their... I mean, the satellite stuff, I know they're testing.
[00:56:33.511 --> 00:56:40.973]  They've got the National Reconnaissance Office and the Interspatial Office, the Geospatial Office... I'm actually...
[00:56:41.826 --> 00:56:45.649]  I wish I was actually that high up in the food chain to be able to find this stuff out and tell you about it.
[00:56:46.430 --> 00:56:49.172]  We already know that they're surveilling the American people.
[00:56:49.632 --> 00:56:55.217]  My whole point is, as a Marine, I'm just curious what applications you've been involved in.
[00:56:56.518 --> 00:56:58.159]  I'm just a mechanic.
[00:56:58.900 --> 00:56:59.480]  I'm a sergeant.
[00:57:00.839 --> 00:57:07.483]  I actually heard earlier when they were at the baby's toy store with that sergeant that was there kind of laughing at you.
[00:57:07.643 --> 00:57:09.204]  Dude, I respect you, Alex.
[00:57:09.424 --> 00:57:10.605]  You know, you woke me up.
[00:57:11.086 --> 00:57:14.968]  Your endgame sold me right there from the start because I know that kind of stuff happens.
[00:57:15.188 --> 00:57:17.349]  I mean, new technology nowadays, people are evil.
[00:57:17.770 --> 00:57:20.712]  You know, it's going down, and you helped me out with that.
[00:57:21.412 --> 00:57:23.874]  I joined the Marine Corps out of service for my country.
[00:57:23.894 --> 00:57:25.274]  I thought I was doing something right, you know?
[00:57:25.935 --> 00:57:27.416]  I'm at 2%, you know what I'm saying?
[00:57:28.076 --> 00:57:35.138]  And as far as the surveillance on the American public, personally Alex, I swear I don't know anything about it.
[00:57:35.298 --> 00:57:37.398]  And if it's happening, God help us all, sir.
[00:57:38.678 --> 00:57:42.139]  Well, I mean, I was sent videos of Operation Death Star.
[00:57:44.039 --> 00:57:45.140]  That's secret, by the way.
[00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:47.740]  But we did put clips of it on Local Access.
[00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:50.501]  Operation Death Star, I was sent by Marines.
[00:57:51.461 --> 00:57:57.002]  That was a surveillance operation of pretended militia groups attacking
[00:57:57.242 --> 00:58:02.943]  Operation Urban Warrior 1999 in Oakland, California.
[00:58:03.063 --> 00:58:06.524]  And in the Death Star video, we are being followed.
[00:58:06.544 --> 00:58:08.765]  But they came in, played a clip on TV, wouldn't let me have it.
[00:58:09.205 --> 00:58:13.606]  Turned out one of the local producers' son was involved in Operation Death Star.
[00:58:14.326 --> 00:58:20.968]  And they had drones up there following me from my hotel down to the Marine Corps takeover drill.
[00:58:21.947 --> 00:58:27.490]  Do you see how they're integrating all of this control?
[00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:32.332]  They're so on top of it that Operation Death Star was tracking me.
[00:58:33.112 --> 00:58:33.752]  Right, yeah.
[00:58:33.792 --> 00:58:39.395]  They actually came out with a new program called Center for Irregular Warfare.
[00:58:39.415 --> 00:58:40.895]  It just came out.
[00:58:41.796 --> 00:58:43.756]  I never heard of it until just a couple days ago.
[00:58:43.797 --> 00:58:47.038]  I was searching on the internet with one of my superiors and we found it.
[00:58:47.805 --> 00:58:49.186]  I don't know.
[00:59:04.051 --> 00:59:09.772]  I mean, it's just insanity the kind of stuff that's going on behind our backs, even the Marines that are under my belt.
[00:59:09.852 --> 00:59:15.494]  I try teaching them all the time, Alex, you know, posse comitatus, the habeas corpus and everything, but they laugh at me.
[00:59:15.854 --> 00:59:20.135]  My superiors were laughing today when they heard about the Marines and telling that whole thing.
[00:59:20.155 --> 00:59:22.855]  They were laughing and they were ridiculing me the whole time, you know.
[00:59:22.995 --> 00:59:25.996]  I'm embarrassed, but you know, at the same time, I'm going to have the last laugh because
[00:59:26.956 --> 00:59:35.920]  Wait a minute, so they think it's okay they're absorbing the National Guard and going to put 20,000 combat army troops on the streets and they think it's okay the Marines have trained to confiscate farms.
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:37.881]  I mean, they think all of that is okay?
[00:59:38.541 --> 00:59:39.162]  They're dumbed down.
[00:59:39.522 --> 00:59:40.082]  They're dumbed down.
[00:59:40.102 --> 00:59:40.602]  They refuse.
[00:59:40.622 --> 00:59:44.324]  These are all the same people that are searching football statistics on the internet.
[00:59:45.765 --> 00:59:46.505]  Good to hear from you.
[00:59:46.525 --> 00:59:47.345]  I appreciate your call.
[00:59:47.386 --> 00:59:48.346]  Call back again.
[00:59:48.366 --> 00:59:51.227]  You guys want to go another 20 minutes or so here?
[00:59:51.868 --> 00:59:52.788]  In the maiden voyage?
[00:59:53.528 --> 00:59:54.729]  Maiden voyage is going pretty well?
[01:00:00.051 --> 01:00:00.551]  You're down?
[01:00:00.791 --> 01:00:01.972]  Are you on air, Paul, when you're talking?
[01:00:03.412 --> 01:00:04.213]  Well, maybe you should be.
[01:00:04.233 --> 01:00:08.014]  Because folks will think I'm talking to Casper the Ghost or something in there.
[01:00:08.655 --> 01:00:09.475]  Let's cut to Aaron.
[01:00:09.515 --> 01:00:10.336]  Let's zoom in on him.
[01:00:10.376 --> 01:00:11.676]  Get a close shot on Aaron Dyches.
[01:00:12.757 --> 01:00:16.278]  We were... There's Aaron Dyches, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:18.759 --> 01:00:20.680]  There he is, my friends.
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:25.642]  Aaron, tell me basically what happened with the Marines.
[01:00:25.662 --> 01:00:26.683]  I mean, we had Mr. Dillon.
[01:00:30.276 --> 01:00:42.021]  Call in on the show, he's done some reports for us, he's the guy that got Governor Perry on that time, and he's down there going to work and he sees Marines in North Austin out front, the Toys R Us, getting toys for the children.
[01:00:42.561 --> 01:00:59.729]  And again, that sounds reasonable, but then when you read the Army's own report, they say for PR purposes, and this was in the Army Times a few weeks ago, that they're going to have the military
[01:01:02.917 --> 01:01:06.300]  Going around with the jaws of life, opening up car wrecks.
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:07.362]  Again, that's for pure PR.
[01:01:07.562 --> 01:01:07.982]  Well, you're not.
[01:01:08.403 --> 01:01:09.824]  What's wrong with the military on the streets of America?
[01:01:09.964 --> 01:01:12.327]  They're helping people out of their wrecked cars.
[01:01:12.367 --> 01:01:14.029]  This is the best thing since sliced bread.
[01:01:17.364 --> 01:01:36.040]  So, think about what's going on with that, and now they're out there in full battle gear with their machine guns, which by the way is illegal, and they are, at least it was in the past, I haven't checked lately, maybe it's been overthrown, and they're out there, the people are donating toys to them, and then they give them to the needy children.
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:39.903]  How about the children get their Bill of Rights, their Constitution, their Declaration of Independence?
[01:01:40.063 --> 01:01:42.385]  How about they don't have roving government bands kidnapping them?
[01:01:42.785 --> 01:01:50.748]  How about government get off their back instead of always abusing them, instead of always feeding on them and putting sodium fluoride in their water.
[01:01:51.068 --> 01:01:52.709]  Aaron, you got there, you just got back.
[01:01:53.249 --> 01:01:54.550]  Tell folks out there what you saw.
[01:01:55.110 --> 01:02:03.953]  Yeah, we actually missed the troops, but we talked to the local radio station that was running with the Marines the Toys for Tots, and they told us how good it was.
[01:02:04.994 --> 01:02:07.595]  And one of your best listeners, he's a
[01:02:09.127 --> 01:02:10.687]  A military vet of some kind.
[01:02:11.128 --> 01:02:13.508]  And they asked him, are you a military vet?
[01:02:13.708 --> 01:02:14.548]  Yes, sir, I am.
[01:02:14.608 --> 01:02:16.129]  Well, shame on you!
[01:02:16.749 --> 01:02:18.749]  Asking questions, shame on you!
[01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:20.850]  Those weren't even real guns!
[01:02:22.350 --> 01:02:27.112]  They tried to say that the mounted guns on top of the Humvees were not real.
[01:02:27.132 --> 01:02:28.752]  Quote, not real.
[01:02:28.772 --> 01:02:31.273]  So there's total delusion.
[01:02:31.313 --> 01:02:35.134]  Just, just, those weren't even... Well, I mean, we had a lot of our listeners show up and see them.
[01:02:35.174 --> 01:02:36.154]  Why did the Marines leave?
[01:02:37.352 --> 01:02:38.214]  I don't know why they left.
[01:02:38.234 --> 01:02:40.037]  They were gone by the time we got there.
[01:02:40.498 --> 01:02:42.923]  But we were told, oh, children love the guns.
[01:02:43.064 --> 01:02:44.527]  Children love that kind of thing.
[01:02:45.555 --> 01:02:46.896]  But they weren't even real guns.
[01:02:46.956 --> 01:02:48.316]  But children love guns.
[01:02:48.717 --> 01:02:49.637]  Well, they do love guns.
[01:02:49.657 --> 01:02:52.138]  But the point is, you don't... This is part of acclamation.
[01:02:52.458 --> 01:02:53.879]  Putting troops in sports stadiums.
[01:02:53.899 --> 01:02:54.800]  Kentucky Derby.
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:59.282]  It's in my martial law film I made in 2004-2005.
[01:02:59.362 --> 01:03:03.364]  Troops at sports stadiums at college and high school games.
[01:03:03.924 --> 01:03:05.165]  Searching people.
[01:03:05.905 --> 01:03:07.346]  Searching people.
[01:03:08.703 --> 01:03:17.356]  Running around with photos that their listeners took of little children having their little bag searched, looking up, with a guy with a gun searching it.
[01:03:17.937 --> 01:03:18.137]  Nuts!
[01:03:18.217 --> 01:03:21.462]  I mean, oh, you're a five-year-old little girl with blonde hair and blue eyes.
[01:03:21.502 --> 01:03:22.323]  You're El Coda.
[01:03:23.545 --> 01:03:24.006]  Go ahead, Aaron.
[01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:25.560]  That's it.
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:35.544]  I mean, basically these radio station people were laughing at us, laughing at other patriots for asking questions about why there's troops with guns on the streets at public places.
[01:03:35.564 --> 01:03:38.004]  But it's toys, but they're going to be helping at car wrecks.
[01:03:38.304 --> 01:03:45.287]  But then it states they're also going to be running military operations for insurrection and riots against the American people.
[01:03:45.567 --> 01:03:46.527]  But lots of PR.
[01:03:46.587 --> 01:03:47.428]  Here's toys!
[01:03:47.728 --> 01:03:49.208]  I'm fixing the crashed car!
[01:03:49.548 --> 01:03:51.649]  Oh, the military flighted somebody to car wreck.
[01:03:51.909 --> 01:03:54.290]  We can't have a local infrastructure of police and firemen.
[01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:56.391]  We've got to have the military doing it.
[01:03:56.932 --> 01:03:59.394]  Well, I guess you're either for the troops or you're against them.
[01:04:01.095 --> 01:04:01.675]  As they say.
[01:04:02.336 --> 01:04:02.536]  Yep.
[01:04:02.936 --> 01:04:08.040]  Well, I am against the troops being given experimental smallpox and anthrax shots that killed so many, but I guess that means I'm evil too.
[01:04:09.461 --> 01:04:14.025]  I mean, I guess the Romans were against the troops because they didn't want Caesar to bring the troops into Rome.
[01:04:14.045 --> 01:04:16.066]  Because you weren't supposed to have the troops in Rome.
[01:04:16.266 --> 01:04:20.410]  You weren't supposed to have them in Italy, south of the Rubicon, because that would be a police state.
[01:04:20.650 --> 01:04:22.631]  Because that would allow a takeover of the government.
[01:04:22.651 --> 01:04:23.972]  And now, the military...
[01:04:25.046 --> 01:04:38.351]  is being threatened against Congress and the banks and Bloomberg reported yesterday Bloomberg reported yesterday that War Powers, in fact Google, under Google News, War Powers Bloomberg.
[01:04:38.891 --> 01:04:42.392]  I want to show people the War Powers article.
[01:04:42.412 --> 01:04:45.493]  It says War Powers declared by Federal Reserve.
[01:04:46.253 --> 01:04:51.135]  They told Congress, they told the other Fed Governors, you aren't involved in anything.
[01:04:51.575 --> 01:04:53.476]  This is War Powers.
[01:04:54.468 --> 01:04:55.268]  Aaron, what do you think of that?
[01:04:56.008 --> 01:04:56.709]  It's incredible.
[01:04:56.789 --> 01:05:00.350]  I mean, it's such a bait-and-switch, such a swindle.
[01:05:00.910 --> 01:05:07.872]  They had this pretended power, and then they come in and usurp it, just like we knew they would, and they just pulled a fast one on everyone.
[01:05:08.632 --> 01:05:09.192]  Absolutely.
[01:05:09.232 --> 01:05:10.273]  Here, I'll direct on air.
[01:05:10.313 --> 01:05:11.933]  See how there's too much room in back of him?
[01:05:12.413 --> 01:05:14.394]  We need to swivel that where there's more room in front.
[01:05:15.999 --> 01:05:17.360]  In fact, this will be the new thing we do on the show.
[01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:17.740]  There we go.
[01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:20.561]  Maybe even a little bit more room in front of him.
[01:05:20.681 --> 01:05:22.142]  We want to get him exactly centered.
[01:05:22.422 --> 01:05:23.062]  We want to have room.
[01:05:23.102 --> 01:05:23.742]  There we go.
[01:05:23.762 --> 01:05:29.644]  Again, for those watching later on the web, as this is ripped to the four corners of the earth, this is a live test, December 12, 2008.
[01:05:29.764 --> 01:05:35.627]  I'm going to be doing a live video feed, sometimes the whole four hours, generally an hour or two.
[01:05:36.267 --> 01:05:39.608]  It's set times on PrisonPlanet.tv for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[01:05:39.988 --> 01:05:44.350]  We're also going to develop this show in here and in the other studio we're building that's a TV set.
[01:05:44.830 --> 01:05:45.310]  I think so.
[01:06:05.242 --> 01:06:06.122]  Paul Hartman, a.k.a.
[01:06:06.182 --> 01:06:10.023]  The Hoosh, and I want to thank Dan and Bob that are in there.
[01:06:10.484 --> 01:06:12.804]  Dan especially doing IT work that's just off the charts.
[01:06:13.204 --> 01:06:16.565]  Aaron Dykes, Rob Jacobson, and that's it.
[01:06:16.625 --> 01:06:18.466]  That's the team around here.
[01:06:18.926 --> 01:06:29.969]  The other folks are a couple people in shipping, one in customer service, and then the writers, Steve Watson, Paul Watson, Kurt Nemo, and then one other IT guy, Dwayne Coots, who is in Louisiana doing some side work.
[01:06:30.249 --> 01:06:31.009]  I mean, that's the team.
[01:06:31.049 --> 01:06:31.429]  That's it.
[01:06:31.930 --> 01:06:33.010]  I mean, that's all there is here.
[01:06:33.611 --> 01:06:38.864]  and uh... it's very expensive to do this but uh... and we did all this you know we bought
[01:06:39.954 --> 01:06:45.919]  One of the cheapest plasma TVs we could, because LED or LCD, they say shimmers doesn't work as good.
[01:06:46.279 --> 01:06:54.426]  We bought the cheapest TriCaster Studio, and boy, we're finding out that wasn't a good move.
[01:06:54.686 --> 01:06:55.667]  What's going on here?
[01:06:56.087 --> 01:06:57.509]  Anyway, it's crashing several times.
[01:06:57.529 --> 01:06:58.389]  Only during the show, though.
[01:06:58.429 --> 01:06:59.790]  Never other than that.
[01:06:59.810 --> 01:07:02.493]  And we bought the cheapest robotic cameras there are, though they look pretty good.
[01:07:03.553 --> 01:07:05.915]  In fact, maybe one of the robots can aim at one of the other robots.
[01:07:05.935 --> 01:07:08.658]  I don't know if they can shoot through that tripod and get them, but it doesn't matter.
[01:07:09.364 --> 01:07:09.684]  I think so.
[01:07:25.785 --> 01:07:29.708]  Again, building an even nicer TV studio in there for interviews as well.
[01:07:30.309 --> 01:07:36.153]  And I'm going to put a little lectern in here and do announcements in a little focused five-minute announcement, a little newscast.
[01:07:36.173 --> 01:07:43.739]  And I'm going to try to squeeze in like a five-minute produced quick news blitz every day where I'm focused right into the camera covering the news with the articles going bam, bam, bam, bam.
[01:07:44.139 --> 01:07:47.162]  So we're trying to do that for everybody as well, just intensifying what we're doing
[01:07:47.902 --> 01:07:49.844]  And I commend the entire team.
[01:07:50.164 --> 01:07:54.807]  And I hope people out there will financially support us, because this is all very, very expensive.
[01:07:55.408 --> 01:08:01.172]  And it was not my idea to have the Ron Paul Money Bomb, but the folks that did the original Ron Paul Money Bomb came up with the idea.
[01:08:01.192 --> 01:08:03.614]  I said, OK, might as well get behind it.
[01:08:03.714 --> 01:08:05.115]  $249,000 was raised.
[01:08:05.876 --> 01:08:09.979]  Doing this on the cheaps has been $160,000 so far.
[01:08:09.999 --> 01:08:10.980]  Running through that money fast.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.202]  Pulling the other studio, we're probably going to run out of all that money.
[01:08:13.562 --> 01:08:15.123]  And then I've got to come up with my money myself.
[01:08:15.143 --> 01:08:17.165]  It's not too expensive, really.
[01:08:18.306 --> 01:08:20.988]  A couple thousand dollars a pop to get on Dish Network or DirecTV.
[01:08:21.088 --> 01:08:22.509]  If they'll let you on is the issue.
[01:08:22.529 --> 01:08:25.532]  I'm going to have to buy it and select cable markets, then there's all those hassles.
[01:08:27.173 --> 01:08:33.079]  There are a few TV channels that are interested in carrying the show themselves, but they've got
[01:08:34.301 --> 01:08:38.743]  Maybe a million viewers a day on the whole channel and maybe 50,000 tuning in, but it doesn't matter.
[01:08:39.163 --> 01:08:42.584]  That'll go out internationally and that's another, just one more thing we do.
[01:08:42.644 --> 01:08:43.745]  We do lots of stuff here.
[01:08:43.765 --> 01:08:52.428]  But I do want to say, go to mfallwars.com, buy the books, buy the videos, the prisonplanet.tv memberships, give them as gifts because that is where the money's going.
[01:08:52.788 --> 01:08:54.749]  That is what is funding this operation.
[01:08:54.769 --> 01:08:59.050]  We'll soon give you a tour of the rest of the building and what we're doing here.
[01:08:59.491 --> 01:09:02.172]  Let me jam in some final phone calls for folks that have been
[01:09:03.072 --> 01:09:08.574]  Folks that have been patiently holding out there in internet hinterland.
[01:09:09.154 --> 01:09:10.394]  Sherry in Texas.
[01:09:10.535 --> 01:09:11.655]  Sherry, you're on the air.
[01:09:11.715 --> 01:09:12.075]  Welcome.
[01:09:12.915 --> 01:09:13.496]  Hey Alex.
[01:09:13.736 --> 01:09:15.696]  Congratulations on getting into your new place.
[01:09:16.156 --> 01:09:16.617]  Well, thank you.
[01:09:16.657 --> 01:09:20.858]  We're working out the bugs right now and I'm literally like a galley manager.
[01:09:20.898 --> 01:09:21.798]  I'm flogging them.
[01:09:23.599 --> 01:09:29.161]  Well, I was just going to ask when you were going to have Alan Watt on next?
[01:09:30.111 --> 01:09:30.491]  I don't know.
[01:09:30.591 --> 01:09:33.154]  I mean, we've had him on quite a bit, but we'll have him back on.
[01:09:33.934 --> 01:09:44.763]  Well, just because he likes to talk about the police state and what it's actually for, who it's actually for, and everything that's going to be happening after this.
[01:09:45.023 --> 01:09:55.232]  Also, I was at Burger King the other day, and there's a sign, and I look over it, and it's a sign that says, like anybody else matters.
[01:09:56.522 --> 01:10:00.231]  And I'm like, what in the world does that even mean?
[01:10:00.251 --> 01:10:01.414]  I'll tell you what it means.
[01:10:03.194 --> 01:10:06.077]  Why do they want us to be decadent?
[01:10:06.237 --> 01:10:07.578]  Why do they want us to be hateful?
[01:10:07.658 --> 01:10:11.061]  Because then we don't care about our neighbors, then nobody cares about us.
[01:10:11.401 --> 01:10:16.185]  So it's self-magazine, and I'm loving it, as if anybody else matters.
[01:10:16.545 --> 01:10:17.907]  That way is evil things.
[01:10:17.967 --> 01:10:28.376]  As people starve around you and die around you, or taken to FEMA camps, as the Child Pedophile Services, CPS, takes more children, nobody cares.
[01:10:28.716 --> 01:10:29.156]  It's all...
[01:10:30.257 --> 01:10:45.824]  A foolish, laughing, smart-ass, I-don't-care-about-anybody-but-myself, not understanding that when you don't care about anybody else and you're not involved, and you're detached, only watching 10 hours of TV a day, you literally disintegrate and you lose your humanity.
[01:10:46.185 --> 01:10:49.286]  So that's why we're being shown violence and destruction and death on TV.
[01:10:49.606 --> 01:10:51.507]  All the studies show it desensitizes.
[01:10:51.827 --> 01:10:52.888]  Erin, you want to comment on this?
[01:10:54.356 --> 01:10:58.840]  Yeah, basically the more volume you have of media, the more desensitized you'll be.
[01:10:59.381 --> 01:10:59.801]  I agree.
[01:10:59.841 --> 01:11:01.182]  I mean, we've studied that kind of thing.
[01:11:01.563 --> 01:11:10.130]  But I mean, it's all about, hey, in fact, I've got to pull through a Burger King, because I'm sure that's a new national slogan.
[01:11:10.150 --> 01:11:13.153]  I haven't seen it myself, but it's as if anybody else matters.
[01:11:13.553 --> 01:11:15.755]  But in reality, you're hurting yourself with that junk.
[01:11:16.636 --> 01:11:19.979]  So I guess it's, again, telling you, well, nobody else matters and I don't matter.
[01:11:20.179 --> 01:11:21.160]  But go ahead and make your point.
[01:11:23.735 --> 01:11:26.160]  She was there and I heard the kids run in the room and I guess she's gone.
[01:11:26.521 --> 01:11:26.901]  Call back.
[01:11:26.921 --> 01:11:28.044]  Oh, I'm done.
[01:11:28.104 --> 01:11:29.146]  Okay, Sherry, go ahead and finish up.
[01:11:29.587 --> 01:11:30.709]  Oh, I'm done.
[01:11:30.769 --> 01:11:32.492]  My stuff is talking to me.
[01:11:32.633 --> 01:11:33.655]  But I mean, what did you think?
[01:11:33.715 --> 01:11:35.238]  What did you think it meant when you saw it?
[01:11:36.252 --> 01:11:41.136]  I think it meant don't give a crap about anybody else because it doesn't matter anyway.
[01:11:42.257 --> 01:11:43.257]  Exactly, they're teaching us.
[01:11:43.297 --> 01:11:45.419]  If someone's going to die, let's just get over it.
[01:11:45.759 --> 01:11:46.800]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:48.641]  So what if they stole $8.5 trillion?
[01:11:48.881 --> 01:11:50.423]  So what if they're setting up a new world order?
[01:11:50.563 --> 01:11:51.924]  I don't care about anybody.
[01:11:52.304 --> 01:11:54.286]  But then again, that will destroy you.
[01:11:56.307 --> 01:12:01.911]  It eats you up inside because if you don't care about other people, that just shows how much you care about yourself, which is none.
[01:12:03.092 --> 01:12:05.374]  Well, exactly, but it's more than that.
[01:12:05.454 --> 01:12:10.659]  If no one cares about anybody, we're not unified, we're all... We're not human anymore.
[01:12:10.799 --> 01:12:19.827]  We're all balkanized, we're all stranded, we're all isolated and cornered by their big global enslavement architecture.
[01:12:19.847 --> 01:12:22.870]  The New World Order is unified, and they want us all broken up.
[01:12:22.910 --> 01:12:27.834]  That's why they said 100 years ago in government documents, and we've covered them all, literally on the show,
[01:12:28.815 --> 01:12:37.200]  By name, how they had to break up the family, how they had to destroy the family, how they had to... Starting with the black families.
[01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:43.544]  They decided to break up the black families and the Hispanic families, and now they're moving on to the white families.
[01:12:43.604 --> 01:12:54.631]  Well, 90% of blacks plus were legitimate, meaning born into a two-parent home, and you're three times or four times, depending on the area, with crime and drugs, to be more successful as a two-parent home.
[01:12:55.382 --> 01:12:55.802]  There you go.
[01:13:15.315 --> 01:13:28.813]  And now whites are 50% illegitimate, and it's actually the Hispanics that are pro-family that are only about 35% illegitimate, so they're trying to work on them and break up their Raza, but they're not having as... They've done a very good job.
[01:13:29.113 --> 01:13:30.754]  Well, again, isolating.
[01:13:30.794 --> 01:13:31.695]  They said the family.
[01:13:31.915 --> 01:13:33.376]  People owe allegiance to families.
[01:13:33.416 --> 01:13:34.377]  Families are strong.
[01:13:34.637 --> 01:13:42.403]  We've got to isolate, drug people, dumb them down, and then now they're just a bunch of idiots arrogantly going around going, as if anybody else matters.
[01:13:42.443 --> 01:13:47.406]  And it's all about worldliness and selfishness and they're all unhappy and they're backstabbing.
[01:13:47.646 --> 01:13:50.509]  Did you see that survey of 30 plus thousand?
[01:13:51.529 --> 01:13:53.750]  High school seniors, they've been doing it every year for decades.
[01:13:54.210 --> 01:13:55.130]  The highest level.
[01:13:55.370 --> 01:13:56.690]  Half of them are stealing.
[01:13:57.870 --> 01:13:59.471]  Half of them plus are lying.
[01:13:59.511 --> 01:14:02.891]  And they said... Oh, and yeah, they just go on and admit it nowadays.
[01:14:02.911 --> 01:14:06.692]  Because, you know, even the definition of sex isn't even sex anymore.
[01:14:07.092 --> 01:14:14.214]  And thanks to Clinton, and then in the last eight years, all the kids are running around saying, oh, well, it's okay to kill, you know, brown people.
[01:14:14.494 --> 01:14:15.074]  That's all right.
[01:14:15.434 --> 01:14:16.634]  As long as we get on for them.
[01:14:16.974 --> 01:14:18.195]  That's what they are saying.
[01:14:18.275 --> 01:14:18.875]  Exactly.
[01:14:19.875 --> 01:14:21.278]  They have trained them.
[01:14:23.544 --> 01:14:25.324]  That was an Al-Qaeda caller right there.
[01:14:26.325 --> 01:14:28.185]  That woman's taking care of her children.
[01:14:28.225 --> 01:14:31.026]  They ought to be in a foster home with the state raising them.
[01:14:31.166 --> 01:14:32.226]  I have the textbooks.
[01:14:32.286 --> 01:14:33.106]  People never believed this.
[01:14:33.126 --> 01:14:37.587]  We did a whole show on it with textbooks and documents where they said the family's a disease.
[01:14:37.907 --> 01:14:38.887]  It must be broken up.
[01:14:38.947 --> 01:14:39.847]  It must be destroyed.
[01:14:39.887 --> 01:14:40.907]  It must be eradicated.
[01:14:41.328 --> 01:14:45.328]  And that was, again, 100 years ago, 80 years ago, 50 years ago.
[01:14:45.768 --> 01:14:46.689]  It's all there.
[01:14:46.709 --> 01:14:49.009]  And then I brought on guests reading hundreds of quotes.
[01:14:49.589 --> 01:14:50.449]  Aaron, remember back to that?
[01:14:51.310 --> 01:14:51.730]  I think so.
[01:14:51.850 --> 01:14:52.930]  You remember us doing the show on that?
[01:14:53.956 --> 01:15:10.565]  You remember me having Gatto and all them on, reading all the quotes, and then we actually, I mentioned, and then listeners actually found the textbook I was talking about from ten years ago, that UT uses for social workers, where it says the family is a disease, an arcane thing, it's got to be eradicated, it's got to be gotten rid of?
[01:15:11.486 --> 01:15:12.126]  Yeah, I've seen that.
[01:15:12.426 --> 01:15:14.887]  I mean, we're not kidding around about this, folks.
[01:15:16.068 --> 01:15:17.269]  This is actually going on.
[01:15:17.309 --> 01:15:18.029]  This is happening.
[01:15:18.069 --> 01:15:19.330]  The government is your enemy.
[01:15:20.569 --> 01:15:31.915]  It is there to destroy society, because if you're a military mind and totally cold-blooded, you want to break up families, dump people down, destroy any infrastructure, so your structure can come in and take over, and that structure is eugenics.
[01:15:32.215 --> 01:15:34.557]  They don't want to conquer us to make us their slaves.
[01:15:34.757 --> 01:15:37.558]  They want to conquer us to exterminate 80 to 90 percent of us.
[01:15:38.039 --> 01:15:39.059]  Let's take another call here.
[01:15:39.399 --> 01:15:41.080]  Let's talk to JT in Colorado.
[01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:42.501]  JT, you are on the air.
[01:15:42.521 --> 01:15:43.362]  Hey, Alex.
[01:15:43.882 --> 01:15:44.582]  Good to talk to you.
[01:15:44.942 --> 01:15:46.263]  Dude, it looks good, man.
[01:15:46.363 --> 01:15:47.604]  The widescreen format.
[01:15:48.609 --> 01:15:50.690]  Of course you're pushing some bandwidth.
[01:15:52.331 --> 01:15:52.991]  You can tell.
[01:15:54.172 --> 01:15:58.074]  Even with my T1, I'll get pixelation every once in a while.
[01:15:58.094 --> 01:16:00.535]  Have we increased the bandwidth, guys, that we're sending this out with?
[01:16:01.035 --> 01:16:02.196]  Perhaps we should cut it down.
[01:16:04.077 --> 01:16:05.817]  Or have a high bandwidth and a low bandwidth.
[01:16:06.438 --> 01:16:07.498]  What are we pushing this out at?
[01:16:07.518 --> 01:16:11.160]  Before it was like 400 Gibbler Snippers or whatever it's called.
[01:16:11.681 --> 01:16:12.021]  It's over 500.
[01:16:12.161 --> 01:16:14.783]  Yeah, we better cut it back down to 350 or whatever.
[01:16:15.243 --> 01:16:16.424]  Yeah, that would help.
[01:16:16.504 --> 01:16:18.265]  It would pixelate a lot less.
[01:16:18.425 --> 01:16:24.449]  You know, I'm like, you know, 200 feet from the main T1 head.
[01:16:24.589 --> 01:16:26.751]  So, you know, it's one of those deals.
[01:16:27.311 --> 01:16:34.336]  Anyway, as far as the Toys for Tots thing with the Marines, you know, that's been around for a while.
[01:16:34.396 --> 01:16:36.838]  I remember the first time I saw it was in the early 60s.
[01:16:37.018 --> 01:16:38.659]  Yeah, it's all part of conditioning.
[01:16:39.039 --> 01:16:40.500]  Yeah, well, at that time,
[01:16:41.264 --> 01:16:42.004]  I don't think so.
[01:17:09.004 --> 01:17:16.362]  We're on the other side of the Rubicon because to see Marines in full battle dress with armaments
[01:17:17.729 --> 01:17:21.831]  Collecting toys for children, that is not a good sign at all.
[01:17:22.231 --> 01:17:27.853]  Well, I know we had a bunch of listeners show up with cameras, but by the time we learned of it, it had been going on for hours, they had to drive 30 minutes north.
[01:17:28.233 --> 01:17:39.117]  I hope some listeners took some photos of this, and I hope that listeners out there will get that emailed to Aaron at InfoWars.com, two A's, so we can post some stills or some video of that.
[01:17:39.618 --> 01:17:42.759]  Because I had a bunch of callers call in on and off air and say, no, no, they've got
[01:17:43.879 --> 01:17:47.040]  M60s on top, you know, they've got their guns.
[01:17:47.380 --> 01:17:51.480]  And then Aaron, you were there and the radio station did say they had guns, but said they were fake.
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:53.761]  Yeah, they said they were fake.
[01:17:54.421 --> 01:17:55.421]  Give me a break.
[01:17:55.481 --> 01:17:56.521]  What is the use of that?
[01:17:56.581 --> 01:17:59.362]  I mean, why carry a fake gun to a Christmas collection?
[01:17:59.382 --> 01:18:00.922]  Well, look, I mean, I remember the federal law.
[01:18:01.022 --> 01:18:09.323]  I can't place the exact name of the law, but I remember a federal law where the National Guard, unless it was an order of the governor, couldn't even have rifles out.
[01:18:09.783 --> 01:18:10.684]  Yeah, I remember that.
[01:18:10.704 --> 01:18:12.224]  I was in the Guard at that time.
[01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:15.201]  Yeah, but we had other listeners there.
[01:18:15.261 --> 01:18:17.042]  They said they were real guns.
[01:18:17.263 --> 01:18:19.925]  No, you didn't see the Marines.
[01:18:19.945 --> 01:18:20.785]  You're insane.
[01:18:21.386 --> 01:18:22.326]  You're with Al-Qaeda.
[01:18:23.127 --> 01:18:23.947]  You're Al-Qaeda.
[01:18:24.188 --> 01:18:24.968]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:18:26.049 --> 01:18:32.594]  Also, that interview you did with General Hamid Kul on Tuesday?
[01:18:32.934 --> 01:18:33.274]  Yes, sir.
[01:18:33.754 --> 01:18:39.118]  Man, that connected many dots for the old coyote boy.
[01:18:40.239 --> 01:18:40.659]  It did.
[01:18:43.413 --> 01:18:50.359]  He was talking about Mahan's, oh, it was a theory, it was a logistical theory on how to take Asia.
[01:18:51.259 --> 01:18:55.883]  They're utilizing it here in the United States with the Constitution-free zones.
[01:18:56.844 --> 01:18:59.566]  They have surrounded us with martial law.
[01:19:00.270 --> 01:19:05.071]  No, that's it, and they're slowly, with the ambient background, turning it up, turning it up, turning it up.
[01:19:05.091 --> 01:19:08.092]  It's like a cricket that starts real low, and now it's like, ahhh!
[01:19:08.292 --> 01:19:08.932]  They're like, what?
[01:19:08.952 --> 01:19:09.412]  What's wrong?
[01:19:09.432 --> 01:19:10.593]  The troops are here to help?
[01:19:11.093 --> 01:19:13.013]  Oh my God, they have machine guns that love you!
[01:19:13.033 --> 01:19:18.615]  They pull you over, you know, 90 miles from the border.
[01:19:19.395 --> 01:19:21.295]  And, you know, they, I mean, they check everything.
[01:19:21.375 --> 01:19:23.936]  It's like, you know, you just went through the border or something.
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:27.221]  And when they catch illegal aliens, they let them go.
[01:19:27.742 --> 01:19:31.324]  There are police on record everywhere that when they do catch somebody real, let them go.
[01:19:31.664 --> 01:19:36.347]  It is for us, because they've stolen $8.5 trillion in seven weeks.
[01:19:36.407 --> 01:19:38.048]  Can you imagine what they're going to do next?
[01:19:38.108 --> 01:19:39.329]  And folks, we've got to pay for all of that.
[01:19:39.349 --> 01:19:39.889]  We're bankrupt.
[01:19:39.949 --> 01:19:40.349]  It's over.
[01:19:40.689 --> 01:19:41.070]  That's it.
[01:19:41.170 --> 01:19:47.574]  I mean, our progeny, 20 generations, are still going to be paying for that.
[01:19:48.536 --> 01:19:50.777]  We dismantle that system post-case.
[01:19:50.957 --> 01:19:53.038]  Well, this is an illegitimate thing they're doing.
[01:19:53.058 --> 01:19:53.738]  Well, yeah.
[01:19:53.778 --> 01:19:55.018]  This is all criminal.
[01:19:55.058 --> 01:19:55.919]  This is martial law.
[01:19:55.959 --> 01:19:56.579]  This is tyranny.
[01:19:56.619 --> 01:19:57.539]  I appreciate your call.
[01:19:58.099 --> 01:19:58.800]  Let's take one more.
[01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:00.000]  Tim in Houston, and then that's it.
[01:20:00.020 --> 01:20:01.060]  We're going to end transmission.
[01:20:02.081 --> 01:20:02.341]  Alex.
[01:20:02.481 --> 01:20:03.181]  Yes, sir.
[01:20:03.321 --> 01:20:04.382]  I enjoyed your program.
[01:20:04.722 --> 01:20:06.762]  Thanks for all the hard work you do.
[01:20:07.503 --> 01:20:09.703]  And I just had a comment for you.
[01:20:10.244 --> 01:20:16.686]  I really appreciate your insight at the beginning of the program this afternoon about your reflecting
[01:20:17.265 --> 01:20:21.848]  And really, I'd just like to give you a quote from Carl Jung.
[01:20:22.648 --> 01:20:29.071]  He said that we are in this world, not of it.
[01:20:30.292 --> 01:20:40.837]  And I think that's, I believe that you espouse that, and I certainly do, and I hope that some of your listeners continue on their path towards consciousness.
[01:20:42.278 --> 01:20:45.500]  Not only what's going on around them, but also what's going on inside them.
[01:20:46.158 --> 01:20:49.942]  That we can all strive to just grow.
[01:20:51.083 --> 01:20:55.327]  Absolutely, because I know I can come off as obnoxious or scatterbrained.
[01:20:55.367 --> 01:20:57.289]  It's because there's so much data.
[01:20:58.490 --> 01:21:08.300]  If I mention a term, then all these files, these memories in my mind of all this research and how it's interconnected, I'm seeing a giant vivid 3D
[01:21:11.631 --> 01:21:18.815]  Or 4D system of this, and then I'm trying to articulate it, and I'm looking at it, and it's pure tyranny.
[01:21:19.295 --> 01:21:24.258]  And it's not just physical tyranny, like I was saying earlier on the show, I think that's what you're alluding to.
[01:21:24.698 --> 01:21:25.839]  This is spiritual.
[01:21:25.899 --> 01:21:28.320]  This is so much more.
[01:21:29.061 --> 01:21:33.763]  More than even the GMO food we eat, it's the TV we watch, the images, the programming.
[01:21:33.863 --> 01:21:36.545]  It's so incredibly wicked.
[01:21:37.805 --> 01:21:40.946]  And, you know, that'll make you really come to grips with the fact that it is spiritual.
[01:21:41.146 --> 01:21:43.727]  Because there's no way that just men could come up with all this.
[01:21:44.147 --> 01:21:45.928]  I mean, it's a system.
[01:21:46.008 --> 01:21:48.748]  It's a hive mind of wickedness.
[01:21:49.529 --> 01:21:55.270]  And then there's that hive mind of goodness and decency that has to, you know, that group consciousness that needs to counter.
[01:21:55.911 --> 01:21:59.652]  But we've got to ask, you know, God to lead God and direct us in that.
[01:22:00.512 --> 01:22:07.655]  You know, it freaks me out that it's admitted that Dyncor and Halliburton run giant child kidnapping rings and comes out in the paper in Congress and nobody gets in trouble.
[01:22:08.055 --> 01:22:10.376]  And then they threaten me and tell me to shut up, and I'm not going to shut up.
[01:22:10.416 --> 01:22:12.977]  I mean, somebody's got to say no to these people.
[01:22:13.497 --> 01:22:19.780]  And I just can't believe that out of all the great, intelligent, smart people in the world, I'm the most prominent in this fight.
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:24.721]  And I know there's all these other more intelligent, more eloquent, more focused, more organized people.
[01:22:25.061 --> 01:22:25.741]  Where are they?
[01:22:25.761 --> 01:22:28.042]  You know, why aren't they standing up?
[01:22:28.622 --> 01:22:32.683]  And I think a lot of it's thinking they can get past the peer pressure of coming out and talking about this.
[01:22:32.863 --> 01:22:37.644]  Even as world government's announced, as the gauntlet is thrown before us, as all of it's thrown in our face.
[01:22:38.185 --> 01:22:38.605]  Anything else?
[01:22:39.705 --> 01:22:47.107]  I'd just like to encourage you to keep doing the good work and just know that your people like myself are out there supporting you and spreading the message.
[01:22:48.683 --> 01:22:55.985]  Well, whatever happens to me, I know it was worth it to stand up for humanity in this one little candle in the wind, as they say.
[01:22:56.385 --> 01:22:57.445]  Just a twinkling of an eye.
[01:22:57.905 --> 01:23:04.467]  All of us are only here for a minute, and when I throw off the mortal coil, or when you throw off the mortal coil,
[01:23:08.715 --> 01:23:18.181]  When we get rid of this Earth suit we're wearing, I know there's more to it, and I'm just not going to be part of cluster bombing children and putting poison in the water.
[01:23:18.781 --> 01:23:21.963]  And again, if I don't fight this, folks, I am part of it.
[01:23:22.963 --> 01:23:24.524]  And that's the thing people need to know.
[01:23:24.584 --> 01:23:32.109]  If you know about this, and that means even if you know about it for a split second and rationalize it, you have brought on your own destruction.
[01:23:32.689 --> 01:23:33.289]  Anything else, sir?
[01:23:33.850 --> 01:23:36.151]  It's just the sin of omission, what you're talking about.
[01:23:37.347 --> 01:23:37.968]  Absolutely.
[01:23:38.068 --> 01:23:41.913]  And Jung was quite a person from Switzerland, wasn't he?
[01:23:41.933 --> 01:23:42.614]  Yeah.
[01:23:42.974 --> 01:23:44.256]  There's a lot of books out there.
[01:23:44.276 --> 01:23:47.439]  I mean, they have many, many books that are written about his writings.
[01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:54.388]  And he wrote, I don't know how many dozens of books, and they're so deep that a normal
[01:23:55.001 --> 01:23:58.864]  Average person can't really comprehend and understand.
[01:23:58.904 --> 01:24:02.066]  You only get it if you've been one of those people that's experienced it.
[01:24:02.346 --> 01:24:10.992]  And if you've experienced it, and I've read a few of his books years ago, you know, I'm not saying I even agree with it all, but the minute you read it, you're like, I've seen this, I've been there, I know it.
[01:24:11.792 --> 01:24:17.876]  But even if people don't consciously understand it, if it was put to a visual form, it is the archetypes.
[01:24:17.976 --> 01:24:19.437]  Everything is the archetype.
[01:24:19.577 --> 01:24:20.218]  Yes, yes.
[01:24:22.199 --> 01:24:23.880]  We have to be that archetype of good.
[01:24:23.940 --> 01:24:26.542]  We have to... That's when we ask God to lead God into darkness.
[01:24:26.562 --> 01:24:33.947]  We have to step into that purpose, step into that vision, and then we will grow with it and become it, and then we will truly tap into the universe.
[01:24:33.987 --> 01:24:35.408]  The enemy is tapped into darkness.
[01:24:35.769 --> 01:24:42.133]  The enemy is tapped into destruction and death and raging, you know, tectonic, titanous, black power.
[01:24:42.573 --> 01:24:45.235]  It's just laziness, Alex.
[01:24:45.295 --> 01:24:50.139]  They've given up to the dark side, and really, it takes a lot of work to
[01:24:50.959 --> 01:24:51.459]  To grow.
[01:24:51.799 --> 01:25:02.464]  It takes a lot of work to want to rest on your merits and really try to achieve a meritocracy in your life.
[01:25:03.204 --> 01:25:12.628]  And at the end of the day, let the chips where they fall and you've done the best you could and leave it on the field, like Vince Lombardi said.
[01:25:13.328 --> 01:25:15.369]  That's just, I think, the only way to live.
[01:25:15.669 --> 01:25:16.550]  We're not in control.
[01:25:20.822 --> 01:25:26.207]  Death is the ultimate loss of control, and it's not up to us.
[01:25:26.247 --> 01:25:33.214]  The only thing we have control of is our reaction to emotion, to our emotions, our reaction.
[01:25:33.595 --> 01:25:35.677]  And we have no control over what happens.
[01:25:35.757 --> 01:25:43.645]  And to try to control things, as you've seen, those people that have, you know, these globalists and so on, that have resources,
[01:25:44.286 --> 01:25:57.295]  For them to even try to control events is really fruitless in the end and will cause their own destruction, if not to their wealth and the material resources they have, to their souls.
[01:25:58.276 --> 01:25:59.236]  And that's all I have to say.
[01:25:59.616 --> 01:26:00.577]  Alright, good to hear from you.
[01:26:01.758 --> 01:26:05.721]  I agree, evil is very limited and burning in its focus, but it is strong.
[01:26:06.341 --> 01:26:08.683]  But nothing compared to good.
[01:26:09.881 --> 01:26:23.891]  And what happens is a lot of people who are slothly and wicked and decadent and just don't care and have that arrogant screw the world attitude, they're saying screw themselves and they're not tying into the much wider universe and world and so I actually feel sorry for them.
[01:26:24.972 --> 01:26:36.200]  But there are a lot of really dark evil people that do understand how things work and they've decided to truly plumb the depths of evil and they are conscious in a way that most of their little minion ringwraiths aren't and
[01:26:40.882 --> 01:26:43.363]  You know, I catch myself on the path to evil all the time.
[01:26:44.397 --> 01:26:47.478]  I mean, I'll think about, maybe I should have this other talk show host on my show.
[01:26:47.498 --> 01:26:50.020]  And I think, yeah, but they've talked crap about me.
[01:26:50.100 --> 01:26:55.782]  But maybe I ought to reach out to them, even if they don't, and just be nice to them and have them on.
[01:26:55.802 --> 01:26:58.143]  And then I'm like, no, I'm not going to do that.
[01:26:58.443 --> 01:26:58.683]  No.
[01:26:59.044 --> 01:27:00.244]  I'm tired of being nice to people.
[01:27:00.284 --> 01:27:05.907]  I'm tired of them reacting bad to me, because I've always been a pretty nice person to people I know and others and reach out.
[01:27:06.227 --> 01:27:13.050]  And then I get bitten so much when I try to help people that I start holding my hand back and then not engaging, not interacting.
[01:27:13.610 --> 01:27:25.760]  So I think that not having that quest or not having that spirit of reaching out and taking risk and at least giving people chances is very, very dangerous.
[01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:30.544]  And there's so many other points and layers and facets to it.
[01:27:31.613 --> 01:27:38.541]  But I can't imagine going back to being a, I wasn't really an evil person, but somewhat of a worldly person.
[01:27:38.561 --> 01:27:39.963]  I'm a lot less worldly than I used to be.
[01:27:39.983 --> 01:27:47.952]  I mean, I have weak worldly things I do, but, you know, I certainly know those things aren't overall good for my heart and soul and body and spirit.
[01:27:50.731 --> 01:27:59.158]  I don't know, I'm very reflective now trying to make this point that's there, but as soon as it comes to my mind I lose it again because it's such a large thought.
[01:27:59.178 --> 01:28:02.081]  I'm trying to simplify it as best I can.
[01:28:03.942 --> 01:28:04.603]  It's just that
[01:28:06.289 --> 01:28:07.710]  I know what I'm saying is the truth.
[01:28:07.850 --> 01:28:10.932]  I know I've done my homework in research history and human activity.
[01:28:10.952 --> 01:28:12.894]  And I know we have some very bad people in control.
[01:28:13.134 --> 01:28:13.995]  They're playing God.
[01:28:14.015 --> 01:28:15.115]  They want to be omnipresent.
[01:28:15.316 --> 01:28:16.857]  They're playing God with genetic engineering.
[01:28:16.877 --> 01:28:18.318]  They're playing God with the surveillance.
[01:28:18.818 --> 01:28:20.159]  They're playing God with our families.
[01:28:20.179 --> 01:28:21.680]  They're trying to reorder things.
[01:28:23.001 --> 01:28:24.522]  And it's a hatefulness.
[01:28:24.622 --> 01:28:25.943]  It's a selfishness.
[01:28:25.983 --> 01:28:33.989]  They're so into themselves and power that they want to hurt others just for wickedness sake so they're not happy and so they don't have great lives.
[01:28:35.527 --> 01:28:45.878]  And I think good people, or people that are half-decent, have to have the will to be able to face the dark side and realize that that's really there.
[01:28:45.918 --> 01:28:51.904]  We like to try to see our reflection in the world and imagine that people in the system are like us, but it really isn't.
[01:28:53.676 --> 01:29:02.943]  And it's like a frequency or it's like a transmission and the evil is just growing and growing and growing, but good is also growing and growing and growing to counter it.
[01:29:03.123 --> 01:29:05.185]  But our enemies are very, very ruthless.
[01:29:06.206 --> 01:29:11.270]  But adults that you see out there,
[01:29:13.123 --> 01:29:13.844]  are like children.
[01:29:13.864 --> 01:29:29.674]  I know everybody remembers being two or three years old, five years old maybe, and imagining you had an imaginary friend, imagining that you were a captain of a spaceship, or you were Paul Revere, or you were John Wayne, and you're out there imagining how great you are, marching around with your chest out feeling powerful.
[01:29:29.994 --> 01:29:36.218]  When I was about three, I was in the backyard doing this by myself, and it was a sunny day and beautiful, and I went, whoa, there's a whole universe.
[01:29:36.559 --> 01:29:40.842]  I'm a tiny island of consciousness, and I'm connected to all of this, and I'm imagining this.
[01:29:41.042 --> 01:29:42.783]  I'm living in a delusion.
[01:29:43.623 --> 01:29:46.045]  I am posing to myself.
[01:29:46.445 --> 01:29:48.026]  Posers pose to themselves first.
[01:29:48.066 --> 01:29:48.746]  They get into it.
[01:29:49.066 --> 01:29:56.730]  You see little girls in Barbie outfits and fake jewels and feeling all, oh, and acting all worldly.
[01:29:57.131 --> 01:29:58.651]  And I'm not even saying that that's evil.
[01:29:58.952 --> 01:30:06.776]  That's part of being a child is imagining so that in the real world you can build towards that as a creator made in the image of God.
[01:30:07.736 --> 01:30:08.417]  A little creator.
[01:30:09.611 --> 01:30:24.768]  And so what happens is all these adults, the BMW, the dressing stylishly, the acting cool, the yuppies walk around downtown looking at each other, you're pathetic, look at you, and they go, oh, you're pathetic, and it's all about insecurity, and it's all about, oh, I'm being dominant, oh, I'm feeling so good.
[01:30:25.729 --> 01:30:37.138]  On the hierarchy of needs, they never knew that helping people, building something, building the species, being part of the species in one endless chain that I don't die, I go on forever through the species as long as it goes on.
[01:30:37.358 --> 01:30:40.721]  The great threat is death of the species, suicide of the species.
[01:30:41.061 --> 01:30:42.341]  That the elite is engineering.
[01:30:42.621 --> 01:30:43.582]  That must be stopped.
[01:30:43.762 --> 01:30:44.562]  I don't die.
[01:30:44.902 --> 01:30:46.723]  I go on to the genetics of my children.
[01:30:46.923 --> 01:30:53.925]  And the fact that the elites with the GMO and the rest of it are changing our DNA and warping it, and that's been admitted in thousands of studies, literally thousands.
[01:30:53.965 --> 01:30:54.445]  Go look it up.
[01:30:54.985 --> 01:30:56.245]  That is the great crime.
[01:30:56.865 --> 01:31:08.229]  And so my instincts, my basic programming, all of that development that goes back into the eons, you know, in this creation, cries out against that.
[01:31:11.365 --> 01:31:18.231]  We have a natural allergy, a natural resistance to this tyranny, and I believe it's going to explode in ways the elite can't even imagine.
[01:31:18.532 --> 01:31:19.613]  And I want the yuppies.
[01:31:19.913 --> 01:31:22.475]  No amount of fur coats, no amount of BMWs is going to make you happy.
[01:31:22.495 --> 01:31:24.237]  I'm not saying you can't have a fur coat or a BMW.
[01:31:24.477 --> 01:31:25.778]  It's just that's not your God.
[01:31:26.059 --> 01:31:27.380]  That isn't what fulfills you.
[01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:30.323]  That's just safe transportation with a titanium cage.
[01:31:32.085 --> 01:31:32.385]  Okay?
[01:31:33.466 --> 01:31:34.506]  It isn't about the trappings.
[01:31:34.546 --> 01:31:35.647]  It isn't about the bling.
[01:31:35.707 --> 01:31:36.788]  It's about the soul.
[01:31:37.088 --> 01:31:38.068]  It's about the mind.
[01:31:38.108 --> 01:31:39.089]  It's about the universe.
[01:31:39.149 --> 01:31:41.310]  It's about the moon and the blue sky.
[01:31:42.150 --> 01:31:43.891]  It's about the deep, beautiful oceans.
[01:31:44.211 --> 01:31:46.573]  It's about the creation all around you.
[01:31:47.293 --> 01:31:50.695]  And that you're meant to guard it and build it and construct and make something good.
[01:31:51.176 --> 01:31:52.517]  That is what humanity is all about.
[01:31:52.557 --> 01:32:02.344]  And none of us are perfect, but we need to reach for the beauty, reach for the beautiful, reach for the divine, instead of falling back into
[01:32:03.996 --> 01:32:04.136]  This
[01:32:20.899 --> 01:32:30.991]  You have to escape that gravitational pull and get without it, and then you will see that you're part of a larger universe and have unlimited potential through the species and through your spirit.
[01:32:31.371 --> 01:32:35.276]  Getting all into the esoteric here, but we are out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:35.776 --> 01:32:37.358]  Get out there and fight the New World Order.
[01:32:37.539 --> 01:32:39.080]  Realize we can defeat these people.
[01:32:39.401 --> 01:32:40.682]  Realize we can bring them down.
[01:32:41.363 --> 01:32:42.223]  I want to thank the crew.
[01:32:42.683 --> 01:32:48.506]  Great job, and we'll see you back next Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., out of the other studio, just on the radio, and back next Monday.
[01:32:48.526 --> 01:32:53.747]  I'm going to try to do the show all four hours out of here, and we'll go for two hours live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:32:53.867 --> 01:32:56.548]  If you're listening on audio, go get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[01:32:56.588 --> 01:33:00.410]  It looks great, and we're upgrading it all the time, and it funds our entire operation.
[01:33:00.770 --> 01:33:01.910]  I'm Alex Jones, signing off.
[01:33:01.930 --> 01:33:06.012]  This December 12, 2008 test transmission, I think, went rather well.
[01:33:06.072 --> 01:33:06.432]  God bless.
