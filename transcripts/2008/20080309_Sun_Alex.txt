[00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:12.115]  Prepare yourself for a talk radio experience like no other.
[00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:14.436]  He stands for truth.
[00:00:15.857 --> 00:00:17.698]  He stands for justice.
[00:00:19.078 --> 00:00:20.639]  He stands for what's right.
[00:00:21.379 --> 00:00:23.861]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:24.821 --> 00:00:27.662]  Call Alex now, toll free at 877-422-4222.
[00:00:29.584 --> 00:00:46.377]  Welcome my friends, welcome and thank you for joining us on this live Sunday edition.
[00:00:46.397 --> 00:00:51.341]  We're here every Sunday covering the week past and the week that we look forward to ahead.
[00:00:52.654 --> 00:00:53.415]  4 to 6 p.m.
[00:00:53.455 --> 00:01:04.425]  Central Standard Time, syndicated from Southern California to Upstate New York on the MNFM dial and going out worldwide on the internet at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:01:06.447 --> 00:01:10.410]  In the news, we're going to be going over some financial information today.
[00:01:10.951 --> 00:01:13.153]  Goldman Sachs raises possibility of $200
[00:01:15.345 --> 00:01:16.306]  A barrel of oil.
[00:01:16.426 --> 00:01:18.307]  It's at 106 right now.
[00:01:18.907 --> 00:01:21.468]  So the national average is about 355 at the pump.
[00:01:21.488 --> 00:01:26.351]  We're talking about, by the summer, $5 a gallon for gas.
[00:01:27.111 --> 00:01:30.253]  Now, in Europe, they're paying less for fuel than they were five years ago.
[00:01:30.293 --> 00:01:33.755]  We're paying more because our dollar is being devalued.
[00:01:33.915 --> 00:01:34.735]  It does matter.
[00:01:35.476 --> 00:01:37.617]  Also, consumer debt grows to $2.52 trillion.
[00:01:41.067 --> 00:01:44.989]  New documents reveal North American Union public relations campaign.
[00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:56.753]  New documents through four-year lawsuits from Information Act, where they had to actually sue to get them, show that they are meeting and talking about how to lie to us about the fact that they're setting up a North American Union.
[00:01:57.174 --> 00:01:59.835]  More smoking gun documents there.
[00:01:59.915 --> 00:02:02.316]  And we first broke this two weeks ago.
[00:02:02.336 --> 00:02:06.598]  We happened to have the California court ruling.
[00:02:06.618 --> 00:02:10.019]  A listener emailed me and said, look at the state
[00:02:10.791 --> 00:02:18.555]  Supreme Court saying that parents don't control their children, or own their children, or have their children, or have custody of their children.
[00:02:18.595 --> 00:02:19.295]  The state does.
[00:02:19.875 --> 00:02:24.597]  Now the Associated Press has picked up on this and is dryly reporting.
[00:02:25.098 --> 00:02:27.759]  Parents don't have constitutional right to homeschool kids.
[00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:30.100]  The state says they own your children.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.081]  So we'll go over that also in other police state news.
[00:02:33.562 --> 00:02:36.123]  Britain makes camera that sees through your clothes.
[00:02:36.143 --> 00:02:36.643]  Reuters
[00:02:37.273 --> 00:02:38.994]  Another story here on the Daily Mail.
[00:02:39.154 --> 00:02:44.757]  Insects become fly-on-the-wall spies with tiny cameras, radio controls, and microphones.
[00:02:44.797 --> 00:02:51.221]  They genetically engineer the flies to actually have cameras and microchip ports on them.
[00:02:51.662 --> 00:02:57.085]  Then they just plug the microchip that controls the cameras and microphones into the fly.
[00:02:57.125 --> 00:03:01.407]  That's how far along genetic engineering is that's already been done.
[00:03:01.828 --> 00:03:04.109]  So we'll be going over that for you today.
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:12.547]  The Sydney Morning Herald, the largest newspaper in the land down under Australia, has the headline, They Knew But Did Nothing.
[00:03:13.728 --> 00:03:14.990]  And it's actually a whitewash.
[00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:23.458]  It is a lengthy, nine-page story, reporting on everything that we told you six years ago, right after the attacks happened.
[00:03:24.335 --> 00:03:33.304]  That they knew the specific, exact information on what was going to happen, when was going to happen, in the months and weeks and days before 9-11, and quote, did nothing.
[00:03:33.344 --> 00:03:36.107]  But this article doesn't get into the other half of the story.
[00:03:36.147 --> 00:03:37.288]  They didn't just do nothing.
[00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:47.158]  The White House ordered senior FBI, to order FBI field leaders, anti-terror head officers, agents,
[00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.202]  In Dallas, in Phoenix, in Minneapolis-St.
[00:03:51.262 --> 00:04:00.850]  Paul, Chicago, in Oklahoma City, in Los Angeles, in San Diego, in Miami, in New York, everywhere.
[00:04:01.451 --> 00:04:04.393]  And some of the FBI agents would refuse to stand down.
[00:04:04.433 --> 00:04:05.894]  They were threatened with arrest.
[00:04:06.355 --> 00:04:07.096]  That's all public.
[00:04:07.156 --> 00:04:09.638]  That's all come out here and there in the news but never got any attention.
[00:04:10.418 --> 00:04:11.980]  But here's a huge story.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.441]  They knew but did nothing.
[00:04:13.892 --> 00:04:14.973]  It's a lot more than that.
[00:04:15.073 --> 00:04:17.115]  People say, well, who were the hijackers then?
[00:04:17.155 --> 00:04:18.016]  They work for the government?
[00:04:18.496 --> 00:04:20.858]  All we know is the hijackers were trained at U.S.
[00:04:20.878 --> 00:04:26.643]  military bases, had the highest level security clearances, and supposedly boarded those planes.
[00:04:27.464 --> 00:04:40.975]  Now, when they work for the government or are trained by the government, the government orders the FBI not to stop them, gives the FBI agents that block them record cash bonuses in 2002, and then demotes or fires the agents that did their job.
[00:04:42.248 --> 00:04:43.669]  Then what does that look like to you?
[00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:53.472]  All we know is we've been lied to, all we know is these people were agents of our criminal government, and we know that the official 9-11 Commission reports are fraud.
[00:04:54.852 --> 00:05:09.677]  And then you look at all the other evidence of bombs in the buildings, and NORAD drills, NORAD standing down, and all of our troops already massed around Afghanistan to invade in the months before, and Bush the day before launching the order, signing the order to launch attack September 12th.
[00:05:10.845 --> 00:05:20.393]  You think they just lined up all the troops and all the aircraft carriers by accident and then magically the attack happened and they attacked days later and they said, look at the incredible, our military was on it in hours!
[00:05:20.774 --> 00:05:22.215]  Well of course they were on it in hours!
[00:05:22.235 --> 00:05:26.238]  They were masked and lined up and ready to go and then magically the towers blow up!
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.762]  I mean, are you starting to put two and two together?
[00:05:30.642 --> 00:05:31.743]  Figure it out for yourself!
[00:05:31.783 --> 00:05:32.684]  Go look into it!
[00:05:32.724 --> 00:05:33.385]  It's incredible!
[00:05:34.446 --> 00:05:36.968]  So we've got that report as well.
[00:05:38.215 --> 00:05:40.276]  That is just some of what we're going to be going over today.
[00:05:40.336 --> 00:05:42.516]  But look, I'm not going to belabor all this news today.
[00:05:42.536 --> 00:05:48.798]  I'm going to give you just the basics of it, point you in the right direction, and then encourage you to do your own research.
[00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:50.479]  Just question reality.
[00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:51.459]  That's all we ask you here.
[00:05:51.579 --> 00:05:53.500]  You know you've been lied to by the government millions of times.
[00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.141]  You know the government's been caught in every type of crime you can imagine.
[00:05:56.441 --> 00:05:57.681]  We're saying the whole government's bad?
[00:05:57.781 --> 00:05:58.021]  No.
[00:05:58.101 --> 00:06:00.602]  But criminal, unaccountable elements are running wild.
[00:06:01.282 --> 00:06:03.023]  But the big issue today is your calls.
[00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:10.772]  I want to get your take on scores of top economists and forecasters that are the top advisors of the Fortune 100.
[00:06:10.952 --> 00:06:20.497]  I interviewed the head of Shadow Stats, who's a big CNN contributor, Friday, and he said 100% we're going to have a depression within two years.
[00:06:21.955 --> 00:06:27.178]  And I interviewed the head of the New York Business School, and he said we're going into a depression.
[00:06:27.658 --> 00:06:34.021]  And Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, the father of ergonomics, the former head of the Treasury, former Wall Street Journal editor, says we're going into a depression.
[00:06:34.781 --> 00:06:40.344]  I hope that's not the case, but I'd like to get your take on what's happening.
[00:06:40.364 --> 00:06:48.788]  We know the dollar has been devalued now by more than 60% from what it was eight years ago when the Euro opened.
[00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:55.542]  We know that it slid another cent last week, and there's only a hundred pennies to slide in a dollar.
[00:06:56.182 --> 00:07:01.404]  I mean, when it slid 60% and it slides another penny, there's only 39 pennies to go, folks!
[00:07:02.184 --> 00:07:05.946]  Now, inflation always affects the nation that's done it last.
[00:07:06.446 --> 00:07:10.448]  Outside, you try to go to England, a crummy hotel's 800 bucks now.
[00:07:11.869 --> 00:07:13.549]  Whereas three years ago, it was 300 bucks.
[00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:13.809]  200 bucks.
[00:07:17.728 --> 00:07:19.409]  Used to, the dollar was king in Canada.
[00:07:19.449 --> 00:07:23.510]  Now, what, the loonie, their money is $1.06 to the dollar.
[00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.231]  Used to be like $0.60 to the dollar.
[00:07:27.391 --> 00:07:29.311]  Now it's worth $0.06 more than a dollar.
[00:07:31.112 --> 00:07:34.393]  The positions have been reversed, and it's sliding every week!
[00:07:35.013 --> 00:07:36.193]  It's not stopping!
[00:07:37.634 --> 00:07:43.875]  And all the financial experts say that if it slides another $0.20 or so in value against other currencies, it's over.
[00:07:45.296 --> 00:07:46.256]  Conservatively,
[00:07:48.038 --> 00:07:52.801]  Your Social Security check, those of you on fixed incomes, has had half its value cut in the last decade.
[00:07:53.141 --> 00:07:55.583]  Now it's telescoping, it's accelerating at the end.
[00:07:55.903 --> 00:07:59.005]  We're talking about in two years it losing another half of its value.
[00:07:59.485 --> 00:07:59.885]  Or more.
[00:08:01.907 --> 00:08:07.290]  But you're only given about 3% increase each year for inflation, when inflation is more like 15% a year.
[00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:08.831]  That's compounded, that builds.
[00:08:09.251 --> 00:08:11.193]  I'd like to hear from you out there.
[00:08:11.853 --> 00:08:13.094]  And maybe you don't care about old people.
[00:08:13.134 --> 00:08:15.015]  Maybe you don't care about retirees that have paid in their whole life.
[00:08:15.395 --> 00:08:16.476]  You know, you're a know-it-all yuppie.
[00:08:17.142 --> 00:08:25.386]  This is going to affect your business, and your company, and where you work, that, what, 20-something percent of the country is on fixed incomes?
[00:08:26.026 --> 00:08:27.967]  And that's accelerating as more people retire?
[00:08:29.448 --> 00:08:31.549]  More baby boomers now retiring, adding on to that?
[00:08:31.569 --> 00:08:36.351]  I mean, that's just one small facet to all of this.
[00:08:36.831 --> 00:08:45.135]  Oil prices being so high, that gets passed on to every facet of the economy, to shipping, and to the products.
[00:08:46.098 --> 00:08:47.478]  Taxes in all of it.
[00:08:48.599 --> 00:08:52.019]  And so you say, I got lots of money, I don't care if gas is four bucks a gallon.
[00:08:52.459 --> 00:08:55.440]  Well, you better care because other people don't have as much money as you do.
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.260]  I'm talking to establishment types who think they're part of the establishment.
[00:08:59.101 --> 00:09:06.642]  It's going to affect your business because the general public, Sally Soccer Mom and Joe Six Pack aren't going to have money to buy your product.
[00:09:09.043 --> 00:09:11.523]  So, that's another facet to all of this.
[00:09:12.043 --> 00:09:13.684]  What's going to happen if we have a depression?
[00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:15.024]  What's going to happen?
[00:09:16.829 --> 00:09:17.849]  What are people going to do?
[00:09:18.729 --> 00:09:25.311]  People were pretty well behaved in the 1930s.
[00:09:25.871 --> 00:09:27.912]  And 80% lived on farms and grew their own food.
[00:09:28.192 --> 00:09:29.612]  Now it's 90% living in the city.
[00:09:30.652 --> 00:09:33.933]  And the 10% living on the farms, what, 4 or 5% of them can grow their own food.
[00:09:34.513 --> 00:09:35.233]  What's going to happen?
[00:09:35.253 --> 00:09:38.734]  It's all about crime in the streets, breakdown of society.
[00:09:40.115 --> 00:09:41.595]  Why are they gearing up for martial law?
[00:09:41.655 --> 00:09:42.715]  Well, it's obvious for that.
[00:09:43.315 --> 00:09:46.276]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with your calls and a lot more.
[00:09:47.148 --> 00:09:47.668]  Stay with us.
[00:09:47.688 --> 00:09:48.229]  The number is 877-590-5525.
[00:09:48.309 --> 00:09:49.389]  It is a big idea.
[00:09:49.429 --> 00:09:50.469]  A new world order.
[00:09:50.629 --> 00:09:56.832]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful dark force.
[00:10:17.593 --> 00:10:20.035]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:10:20.776 --> 00:10:28.182]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:10:31.124 --> 00:10:36.088]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:10:36.588 --> 00:10:40.029]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:10:40.429 --> 00:10:42.529]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for the world.
[00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:44.130]  Most people have no idea.
[00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:44.930]  They're not after money.
[00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:46.010]  They have all the money they need.
[00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:46.971]  They're after power.
[00:10:47.211 --> 00:10:48.331]  That's what they're after.
[00:10:48.351 --> 00:10:52.912]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[00:10:57.073 --> 00:10:57.453]  Endgame.
[00:10:57.833 --> 00:10:59.534]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:10:59.854 --> 00:11:01.014]  You have been warned.
[00:11:01.654 --> 00:11:07.076]  10 Enters from Midas March 3rd 2008 Gold 981 20 ounce gold coins can be purchased for $1,898 or $96.80 per half $248.40 per quarter that's $1,898 or $96.80 and $248.40
[00:11:16.576 --> 00:11:22.418]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[00:11:22.478 --> 00:11:26.680]  treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing a neon revolution.
[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:35.263]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[00:11:35.283 --> 00:11:37.804]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[00:11:38.084 --> 00:11:41.886]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[00:11:42.086 --> 00:11:48.368]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.
[00:11:48.668 --> 00:11:52.110]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:55.271]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in the global game of chess.
[00:11:55.331 --> 00:11:55.671]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:11:55.691 --> 00:11:55.971]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:11:56.031 --> 00:11:56.892]  Hi, neighbor.
[00:12:05.936 --> 00:12:07.637]  We all know that knowledge is power.
[00:12:08.057 --> 00:12:11.158]  We've tried to give you knowledge to help you prepare for rough times.
[00:12:11.778 --> 00:12:16.459]  There's the worldwide famine and our country's dependence on often dangerous food imports.
[00:12:17.079 --> 00:12:19.080]  You know about genetically poisoned food.
[00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:25.222]  Two-thirds of the food is disappearing with the bees along with huge crop failures from all-time record water shortages.
[00:12:25.902 --> 00:12:29.583]  You know they're turning food into fuel with corn ethanol plants.
[00:12:30.527 --> 00:12:34.249]  If we do not control our food, food will be used to control us.
[00:12:34.769 --> 00:12:39.911]  Food control has been the plan historically in every enslaved population and is the plan for America.
[00:12:40.591 --> 00:12:48.835]  The only value of the knowledge you have to take control of your food is if you choose to get a supply while you still have the freedom to choose.
[00:12:49.315 --> 00:12:50.456]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[00:12:50.476 --> 00:12:50.616]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:13:02.845 --> 00:13:03.486]  It's a fact.
[00:13:03.706 --> 00:13:11.192]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:13:11.312 --> 00:13:20.179]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[00:13:20.459 --> 00:13:30.987]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:13:31.247 --> 00:13:37.311]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[00:13:37.531 --> 00:13:42.534]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[00:13:42.734 --> 00:13:47.216]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[00:13:47.377 --> 00:13:49.138]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-877-8000.
[00:13:51.018 --> 00:13:56.460]  That's 877-943-8600 or visit FDRS.org.
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.921]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[00:13:59.101 --> 00:14:02.081]  Visit FDRS.org today.
[00:14:02.101 --> 00:14:08.563]  You're listening to G3N, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:17.960]  All right, we're back live.
[00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:19.721]  Again, I want to get your take on the economy.
[00:14:19.741 --> 00:14:21.641]  You're welcome to call in on any subject you wish.
[00:14:23.142 --> 00:14:30.864]  We have the central banks that own our private and public reserve that made the decision eight years ago publicly to begin the slow death of the dollar.
[00:14:31.525 --> 00:14:33.025]  We're now seeing that happen.
[00:14:33.045 --> 00:14:39.947]  The Council on Foreign Relations, the shadow government that runs our nation, three weeks ago came out and said, yeah, that's true.
[00:14:39.987 --> 00:14:45.829]  We want to get rid of the dollar and create an Amaro to be merged into the European Union's currency, the Euro.
[00:14:46.869 --> 00:14:53.353]  Everything we told you from secret documents and things that came out in lawsuits, they now just throw in your face.
[00:14:54.433 --> 00:14:57.255]  And every chief economist I have on says the same thing.
[00:14:57.275 --> 00:15:03.178]  They want to kill the dollar to bring in their Amero, their North American Union currency that'll then be a Pan-American currency.
[00:15:03.459 --> 00:15:07.461]  Meanwhile, they want to make the public think that there's some scapegoat or somebody for the media to blame.
[00:15:08.822 --> 00:15:14.505]  And while I'm no fan of the actions in the cartel that works with OPEC that works with our oil companies,
[00:15:14.904 --> 00:15:18.647]  It's really not the oil companies at the end of the day that are doing all of this.
[00:15:18.907 --> 00:15:23.951]  They're selling oil, actually for less, to Europe than they were just five years ago.
[00:15:24.632 --> 00:15:26.813]  Because the euro has more value now.
[00:15:27.254 --> 00:15:33.899]  And because it's been pushed up in value and the dollar has been devalued, then it's a world market and many of these nations are moving away from the dollar.
[00:15:34.877 --> 00:15:42.363]  For oil purchases and so we're going to pay $106 a barrel for crude oil and you're going to pay $3.50 for $5.
[00:15:42.583 --> 00:15:44.265]  It's just going to grow.
[00:15:44.285 --> 00:15:49.869]  We're talking about $5 by next year, $4 by the summer for your gallon of gas.
[00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:52.191]  And that affects everything else.
[00:15:53.112 --> 00:15:59.617]  Somebody else that they're blaming, and again a lot of these CEOs are globalists and they're part of it and most of them are part of the SPP shadow government structure.
[00:15:59.637 --> 00:16:00.778]  We've got the documents on that.
[00:16:01.777 --> 00:16:10.182]  But to blame them, and they're making hundreds of millions, 50, 60 million, 30 million a piece, some of them make hundreds of millions a year a piece.
[00:16:12.003 --> 00:16:14.664]  There's one CEO here that's made 161.6 mil.
[00:16:15.645 --> 00:16:21.668]  Those are drops in the bucket compared to the institutional investors, the governmental investors in these companies.
[00:16:21.888 --> 00:16:26.911]  And so they're trying to say, oh, the economy's doing bad because the CEOs are making a lot of money.
[00:16:27.455 --> 00:16:30.337]  The CEO is very small in the entire financial picture.
[00:16:30.637 --> 00:16:42.646]  I mean, you'll have some $300 billion, $250 billion, $100 billion company, and yeah, the CEO is making $200 million a year.
[00:16:43.146 --> 00:16:47.569]  Again, that's a distraction overall to what's actually causing these problems.
[00:16:47.609 --> 00:16:49.190]  It's not that they're being paid so much.
[00:16:50.031 --> 00:16:54.334]  It's that they're being paid so much to ruthlessly destroy this nation and destroy our currency.
[00:16:54.969 --> 00:16:57.890]  It's not that they're in and of themselves being paid a lot that's bad.
[00:16:58.711 --> 00:17:05.414]  So, Congress, Spotlight, CEOs pay, legislators call on executives to explain millions in payments despite companies' failures.
[00:17:06.174 --> 00:17:06.854]  And that is true.
[00:17:06.995 --> 00:17:09.376]  Even as the companies fail, they jump out with golden parachutes.
[00:17:10.016 --> 00:17:10.896]  What do you expect?
[00:17:11.357 --> 00:17:12.777]  Okay, loaded phone lines here.
[00:17:13.938 --> 00:17:16.919]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Rhode Island.
[00:17:17.219 --> 00:17:18.080]  You're on the air, Chris.
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:20.461]  Hello, Alex Jones.
[00:17:20.601 --> 00:17:22.822]  I've been a big fan for at least three years.
[00:17:23.894 --> 00:17:25.235]  I'd like to say thank you for your work.
[00:17:25.255 --> 00:17:25.976]  Thank you, sir.
[00:17:27.037 --> 00:17:31.340]  And, uh, well, I was just listening to your interview of Jordan Maxwell in 2005.
[00:17:32.001 --> 00:17:32.281]  Yes.
[00:17:33.282 --> 00:17:41.448]  And, uh, yeah, he talked about, uh, all these martial law, police state that's coming up if we don't revolt at the end of the year, 2008.
[00:17:43.009 --> 00:17:45.932]  He did say that in 2005, and Jordan is a great scholar.
[00:17:46.647 --> 00:17:50.048]  Yeah, we hope that's not the case, but they're certainly making the preparations now.
[00:17:50.128 --> 00:17:56.409]  Even the Houston Chronicle, San Francisco Chronicle, Chicago Tribune admit the government has built camps for the American people.
[00:17:58.269 --> 00:18:01.670]  And furthermore, like, this one question, I just have one question.
[00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:06.331]  Why, when I tell people about this, they think I'm crazy?
[00:18:07.991 --> 00:18:10.411]  That's because, well, it's an important question.
[00:18:10.911 --> 00:18:14.172]  Because in sitcoms, I mean, even in fiction programs and in books,
[00:18:14.986 --> 00:18:17.348]  And in school and everywhere for 20 years.
[00:18:18.108 --> 00:18:19.529]  You know why I woke up to the New World Order?
[00:18:20.029 --> 00:18:22.391]  I already knew a lot about history, and I was somewhat educated.
[00:18:22.411 --> 00:18:30.496]  But when I was going to college, they would teach us that world government was good, and handing our guns in was good, and sterilization and population reduction was good.
[00:18:30.516 --> 00:18:36.080]  And then I'd turn on CNN and they'd say, crazies believe in this, there's no move for a world government.
[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:39.482]  And I'd go, wait a minute, I'm being taught this at school.
[00:18:41.143 --> 00:18:43.444]  So then I started investigating, when I was about 19 or so.
[00:18:45.504 --> 00:18:46.725]  I got on air when I was 21.
[00:18:47.766 --> 00:18:50.368]  But they've been preconditioned.
[00:18:51.328 --> 00:19:00.375]  Like, I didn't know why 15 years ago, right before I got on air, why they would have cartoons and news programs where they would talk about crazy kooks that think the government wants to put chips in us.
[00:19:01.135 --> 00:19:02.395]  I thought, yeah, they are crazy kooks.
[00:19:02.415 --> 00:19:07.837]  And then suddenly, the media started pushing how we all need to have chips, and how babies need chips, and prisoners need chips.
[00:19:08.237 --> 00:19:11.738]  See, they preconditioned us before they made a move.
[00:19:12.199 --> 00:19:14.479]  They said, if you hear people talk about this, they're kooks.
[00:19:14.919 --> 00:19:20.821]  So then, even when the media then starts pushing it, polite society isn't supposed to talk about it, because that's what weirdos discuss.
[00:19:22.002 --> 00:19:23.922]  You have dumbed-down, cattle-like population.
[00:19:23.942 --> 00:19:24.722]  That's why they're slaves.
[00:19:25.163 --> 00:19:26.143]  They're starting to wake up, though.
[00:19:26.644 --> 00:19:27.364]  But just move on.
[00:19:27.384 --> 00:19:28.165]  People will laugh at you.
[00:19:28.185 --> 00:19:28.745]  Just move on.
[00:19:28.925 --> 00:19:29.906]  Let the dead bury the dead.
[00:19:30.286 --> 00:19:31.387]  Knock the dust off your feet.
[00:19:32.307 --> 00:19:34.188]  Let's go ahead now and take another call.
[00:19:34.288 --> 00:19:35.789]  Scott in Colorado.
[00:19:35.809 --> 00:19:36.429]  You're on the air.
[00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:37.950]  Yeah, this is Scott.
[00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:39.011]  How are you, Alex?
[00:19:39.031 --> 00:19:39.331]  Good, sir.
[00:19:40.732 --> 00:19:41.772]  Great to talk to you again.
[00:19:42.272 --> 00:19:47.195]  I just wanted to bring to your attention a video that I actually uploaded to YouTube.
[00:19:49.728 --> 00:19:58.474]  And the reason I'm calling you, it's not because it's a great video, is I had a response to a little video and I had a response to it within about 30 seconds.
[00:19:59.254 --> 00:20:02.696]  And I was kind of concerned on how fast somebody would respond to it.
[00:20:03.036 --> 00:20:09.440]  And I'm just going to leave you, or give you the information to Google it if you want to.
[00:20:10.181 --> 00:20:13.583]  And it's Colorado Springs Fire Department
[00:20:18.723 --> 00:20:22.084]  Well, that's where the main node of the shadow government is based, as you know.
[00:20:22.104 --> 00:20:22.544]  Right.
[00:20:23.144 --> 00:20:25.644]  And what was the particular drill?
[00:20:26.785 --> 00:20:29.165]  Well, you can watch the video in your break.
[00:20:29.225 --> 00:20:31.966]  It's a minute and 13 seconds, and you can tell me.
[00:20:32.046 --> 00:20:33.726]  I'm just going to go ahead and hang up.
[00:20:34.426 --> 00:20:37.827]  But we have 30,000 troops now moving into
[00:20:38.737 --> 00:20:40.898]  Well, I forgot to have a pen.
[00:20:40.918 --> 00:20:42.218]  Can one of you guys run me a pen in here?
[00:20:42.318 --> 00:20:43.339]  Thanks.
[00:20:43.419 --> 00:20:44.559]  What's the name of the clip again?
[00:20:44.859 --> 00:20:49.941]  It's Colorado Springs Fire Department.
[00:20:50.341 --> 00:20:51.102]  And it's DE.
[00:20:51.242 --> 00:20:54.963]  Okay, but from your own layman's perspective, what are they doing in the drill that's so important?
[00:20:55.003 --> 00:20:57.664]  Well, I don't see any firemen in this drill.
[00:20:59.066 --> 00:21:06.712]  And, uh, there are a lot of people dressed in military garb and also a couple of people, uh, dressed and looking like moon suits.
[00:21:07.092 --> 00:21:09.153]  Sure, so it's Colorado Springs Fire Department Drill?
[00:21:09.634 --> 00:21:10.494]  Fire Department Drill.
[00:21:11.075 --> 00:21:21.222]  And then, if you go ahead and put in, and I also put in posse comitatus because... But the larger issue is somebody instantly responded to you when you put in... Oh, about 30 seconds.
[00:21:22.392 --> 00:21:23.853]  And let me guess, it was a negative response?
[00:21:24.214 --> 00:21:24.794]  Absolutely.
[00:21:25.354 --> 00:21:26.916]  Well, look, they admit this.
[00:21:26.956 --> 00:21:28.657]  The Pentagon, this is in mainstream news.
[00:21:28.837 --> 00:21:37.744]  They said two years ago that they were going to have CENTCOM and use tens of thousands of regular troops to sit on the web and quote, combat this info.
[00:21:38.625 --> 00:21:40.687]  And they admittedly even brag on the sites.
[00:21:41.427 --> 00:21:42.608]  And they'll even have handles.
[00:21:42.668 --> 00:21:45.370]  They're so dumb, they'll have a handle.
[00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:49.934]  Their computer name, you'll find their MySpace, and nine times out of ten, it's a CENTCOM goon.
[00:21:50.803 --> 00:21:52.224]  Engaging in propaganda.
[00:21:52.264 --> 00:21:58.566]  They'll go on my site and say, on the InfoWars message board, and say, I'm going to kill you, I can't wait to gas you in camps.
[00:21:58.927 --> 00:22:05.329]  We take their handle name, find out they're in the military, they're in domestic operations, and we've, you know, done shows on that.
[00:22:05.729 --> 00:22:12.312]  And yes, they are just waiting with anything with the name Alex Jones in the tag.
[00:22:12.873 --> 00:22:14.613]  Did you put Alex Jones in your tag names?
[00:22:15.013 --> 00:22:16.614]  I did put Alex Jones in the tag names.
[00:22:16.654 --> 00:22:18.175]  No, no, we've already done our own study of this.
[00:22:19.096 --> 00:22:22.018]  Of course, regular video won't get commented on for hours, generally.
[00:22:22.278 --> 00:22:24.939]  But anything with my name, they instantly jump on.
[00:22:25.319 --> 00:22:26.980]  So what you do is you dopplegang them.
[00:22:27.521 --> 00:22:34.004]  You upload stuff under the serious name, but you double upload it under a stupid, silly name, and don't put my name on it.
[00:22:34.404 --> 00:22:35.745]  That gets through some of their filters.
[00:22:35.765 --> 00:22:36.546]  Alright?
[00:22:36.626 --> 00:22:37.606]  I'd like for you to see this.
[00:22:37.626 --> 00:22:42.249]  At the very end of it, I'd like for you to see the sheriffs that are in this.
[00:22:42.269 --> 00:22:43.729]  There were no... No, I know.
[00:22:43.789 --> 00:22:45.750]  I've seen these a hundred times, and I will check it out.
[00:22:46.071 --> 00:22:48.092]  Yeah, the military is probably going to take over the town.
[00:22:48.112 --> 00:22:48.432]  I know.
[00:22:49.222 --> 00:22:49.766]  We'll be right back.
[00:23:02.691 --> 00:23:04.373]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:23:04.693 --> 00:23:08.137]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:23:08.318 --> 00:23:10.160]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:13.523]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:23:13.844 --> 00:23:19.330]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:23.555]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[00:26:32.919 --> 00:26:33.980]  We're good to go.
[00:27:04.548 --> 00:27:06.748]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:27:07.148 --> 00:27:12.129]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:24.972]  Alright, we're back live, my friends.
[00:27:25.072 --> 00:27:31.933]  I want to be clear here.
[00:27:34.412 --> 00:27:48.023]  Last Monday, we became aware of a military upload video of three Marines in Iraq with what looks like about a six-week-old black-and-white puppy.
[00:27:48.063 --> 00:27:49.143]  It's clearly a real puppy.
[00:27:49.864 --> 00:27:54.227]  The Marines are clearly...we're either Marines or they were Best Actor Oscar winners.
[00:27:54.267 --> 00:27:55.368]  They were that...it was that real.
[00:27:56.029 --> 00:27:58.771]  Throwing this puppy off of a cliff and then
[00:27:59.522 --> 00:28:03.864]  The Marines said, well, we think it's real, and the guy's name is real, and it checks out.
[00:28:03.904 --> 00:28:06.046]  And a week later, it's been all over the newspapers.
[00:28:06.086 --> 00:28:08.887]  He hasn't recanted and said it wasn't him or it wasn't a real puppy.
[00:28:09.728 --> 00:28:27.878]  But the bigger issue here was that we found hundreds of videos of them torturing animals, shooting and torturing dogs, cats, but more importantly, shooting humans, mowing children down, mowing women down, throwing hand grenades into a sheep herder and a sheep.
[00:28:28.709 --> 00:28:29.950]  Laughing as it explodes.
[00:28:31.211 --> 00:28:32.012]  Hundreds of them.
[00:28:32.072 --> 00:28:33.453]  I quit watching after about a hundred.
[00:28:33.733 --> 00:28:37.256]  So we just posted all of those on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:28:38.317 --> 00:28:39.338]  Then we got the death threats.
[00:28:41.059 --> 00:28:44.302]  We're going to kill you, you hate America, you're with Al Qaeda.
[00:28:45.803 --> 00:28:48.265]  Let me explain something to the people in our military who think this is good.
[00:28:48.806 --> 00:28:55.992]  By defending that, by saying that killing innocent children or killing puppies is good,
[00:28:57.009 --> 00:28:59.651]  You destroy the name of our military and our country.
[00:29:00.352 --> 00:29:01.552]  That behavior is bad.
[00:29:01.592 --> 00:29:13.081]  If you would have said it was bad, instead of making excuses and lying and saying the video wasn't real and it's now admitted that it's real, and all the other videos, then it could have been a bad apple situation.
[00:29:13.101 --> 00:29:22.067]  But by Michelle Malkin and others covering it up, making excuses, by the neocons defending it, it shows this is the policy.
[00:29:22.227 --> 00:29:25.810]  And what do you expect when White House memos that are public,
[00:29:26.579 --> 00:29:42.152]  The Academy Award winning film this year, Taxi to the Dark Side, has the information we played here on air three years ago, John Yoo, Chief White House Counsel, at a CFR meeting saying, yeah, we are torturing children with pliers, sexually, and we're allowed to do that.
[00:29:42.733 --> 00:29:44.054]  And even the CFR boo's him.
[00:29:44.974 --> 00:29:45.715]  And then laughs at him.
[00:29:45.735 --> 00:29:46.716]  I don't think it's a laughing matter.
[00:29:47.196 --> 00:29:48.858]  But that's the Academy Award winning documentary, 2008.
[00:29:49.979 --> 00:29:50.659]  So that's real!
[00:29:50.679 --> 00:29:51.420]  Okay?
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.922]  By the way, Taxi to the Dark Side is free on Google right now.
[00:29:54.967 --> 00:30:00.028]  I went and saw it at the theater at the Arbor a few weeks ago, and then boom, there it was on Google Video.
[00:30:00.048 --> 00:30:10.870]  We put a link to it up on InfoWars.com, but it's actually the dark side on Google right now, where all their memos, all their training manuals, torture children in front of their parents, the rest of it.
[00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:22.892]  Now, when people come out and they defend that, and when the White House says that's good, until public opinion turned against them, and they said, we never said that, and they prosecuted people they ordered to do the torture, pretty sick,
[00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:29.151]  I'm against those that torture, but even more those that give the orders, and then they have the nerve to burn the people that follow us.
[00:30:30.692 --> 00:30:32.553]  When you do that, then you start getting troops.
[00:30:33.913 --> 00:30:37.674]  And American soldiers have always, you know, been cut above the rest, historically.
[00:30:37.914 --> 00:30:40.435]  Not just from our own history, but I've read other histories of our soldiers.
[00:30:41.235 --> 00:30:43.616]  In the Revolutionary War, we were much better behaved than the British were.
[00:30:44.697 --> 00:30:45.897]  And so on and so forth.
[00:30:46.397 --> 00:30:51.859]  Not that we have a perfect history, but now this is among some of the worst type war crimes I've ever seen against humans.
[00:30:52.659 --> 00:30:56.780]  They just sit off the side of the road laughing, randomly shooting cars, minivans full of women and children.
[00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:58.600]  They fall out dead and the troops are laughing.
[00:30:58.620 --> 00:30:59.800]  I mean, there's videos of that.
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:06.341]  There's videos of them making fun of handicapped kids and calling them names.
[00:31:07.662 --> 00:31:11.642]  And that seems to get people more mad than just machine-gunning men, women, and children for fun.
[00:31:12.822 --> 00:31:14.363]  Why are people so mad about this puppy?
[00:31:16.603 --> 00:31:18.363]  Because everybody knows the puppy was innocent.
[00:31:18.403 --> 00:31:21.464]  We've already dehumanized the Iraqis to where they're not even human, not even an animal.
[00:31:22.273 --> 00:31:23.493]  That's how they've been sold.
[00:31:23.533 --> 00:31:24.294]  They are human beings.
[00:31:25.234 --> 00:31:25.934]  They don't deserve that.
[00:31:25.954 --> 00:31:28.335]  I thought we were liberating them.
[00:31:28.375 --> 00:31:31.676]  But, uh, it is shocking on the Dig comments.
[00:31:31.696 --> 00:31:33.137]  We post articles, people would comment.
[00:31:33.317 --> 00:31:34.377]  Dig's one of the biggest websites.
[00:31:34.957 --> 00:31:37.618]  And they're in there saying, I can't wait to get you into camp and kill you.
[00:31:38.138 --> 00:31:44.160]  And then you go to their handle and it links right to their MySpace page and it's them and they're saying similar things and they're in full uniform.
[00:31:44.521 --> 00:31:51.703]  I mean, that's scary when trained killers are on my website saying, and on our subpages, and on our YouTube videos saying, we're gonna kill you, Jones!
[00:31:53.129 --> 00:31:54.549]  What happened to you?
[00:31:54.729 --> 00:32:02.711]  How did you become so evil that you think it's unpatriotic for me to say our troops need to be punished when they do that?
[00:32:04.051 --> 00:32:06.911]  People are criticizing the Austin police chief for people around the country.
[00:32:07.211 --> 00:32:08.092]  It's a microcosm.
[00:32:08.352 --> 00:32:15.293]  We finally got a police chief that's actually punishing cops that shoot people in the back and shoot fleeing suspects from non-violent crimes.
[00:32:15.373 --> 00:32:21.854]  And he's saying, look, I've read the transcripts, the letters, the testimony he's given.
[00:32:23.917 --> 00:32:29.360]  In these court cases where they're trying to reinstate bad cops, and he says, look, if we let bad cops do this, it gives us all a bad name.
[00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:30.900]  It makes perfect sense.
[00:32:31.321 --> 00:32:32.161]  It's the same thing.
[00:32:32.621 --> 00:32:41.606]  When you have people saying torture, and killing kids, and murdering little puppies is good, then it totally destroys the entire military's name.
[00:32:41.726 --> 00:32:44.127]  I'm trying to defend our military, you idiots!
[00:32:45.147 --> 00:32:50.390]  You can't come in and say that's okay, then it makes it look like everybody's for it.
[00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:52.551]  What is your problem?
[00:32:53.473 --> 00:33:01.335]  ABC News, of all places, had a headline saying, oh, they're under mental stress, they're victims, the troops killing these animals.
[00:33:02.495 --> 00:33:04.756]  Was Jeffrey Dahmer who started out killing animals?
[00:33:05.776 --> 00:33:06.557]  Or Ted Bundy?
[00:33:06.637 --> 00:33:07.477]  Or John Wayne Gacy?
[00:33:07.577 --> 00:33:11.518]  Every major serial killer, in every case we've seen, tortures animals.
[00:33:14.519 --> 00:33:19.360]  And you have this vitriol where all these military people work for the government,
[00:33:19.992 --> 00:33:25.316]  It's been in the news about the billions of fake news the White House purchases each year for buying off reporters, fake newscasts.
[00:33:25.336 --> 00:33:29.299]  I mean, this is the military engaging in domestic propaganda, running PSYOPs against us.
[00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:38.305]  And then to see them go on Dig, where you vote things up to the main page and they all brag, we're the Berry Brigade, most of them are military, they bury all the stories we write so people don't see them.
[00:33:39.286 --> 00:33:40.647]  I mean, is that an American thing to do?
[00:33:40.667 --> 00:33:45.331]  To go in there and be on government payroll and be blocking what I say and what I do?
[00:33:45.571 --> 00:33:47.212]  By the way, it isn't working.
[00:33:48.883 --> 00:33:52.624]  My radio show is one small part of what I do, but it's all growing exponentially.
[00:33:52.984 --> 00:33:56.265]  We can put up any video now and it gets 100,000 views in a couple days.
[00:33:57.045 --> 00:34:03.547]  Just, I mean, tens of millions of people a day that we can track on YouTube and Google alone, only two platforms, and there's hundreds of others that are big.
[00:34:04.807 --> 00:34:09.348]  Hundreds of millions of people a week are watching my little local Austin TV show on the web now.
[00:34:11.008 --> 00:34:12.469]  I'm just one person in this fight.
[00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:17.050]  I mean, the worst thing you could ever do is kill me.
[00:34:17.992 --> 00:34:21.774]  That would then make more people look into what I've said and what I've done.
[00:34:23.715 --> 00:34:25.116]  And all I want is a free country.
[00:34:25.196 --> 00:34:28.077]  All I want is for you to not have your dollar devalued troops.
[00:34:28.978 --> 00:34:30.158]  Now, by the way, I want to be clear.
[00:34:31.499 --> 00:34:34.621]  The majority of the troops support this radio show.
[00:34:35.701 --> 00:34:42.285]  You go to one of my rallies, or one of my events, and literally there's just huge numbers of military there from Fort Hood here in Austin.
[00:34:42.625 --> 00:34:43.405]  Or I go to L.A.
[00:34:43.425 --> 00:34:44.946]  for an event and they're up there from San Diego.
[00:34:46.844 --> 00:34:47.585]  It doesn't matter where.
[00:34:47.645 --> 00:34:54.247]  And Ron Paul got 73% of all military donations from Republican voters.
[00:34:55.188 --> 00:35:01.630]  He got 73% of all the campaign contributions from the military that were given to Republicans.
[00:35:04.031 --> 00:35:06.112]  That was when Ron Paul was running against 10 different people.
[00:35:07.333 --> 00:35:08.213]  And it held right through.
[00:35:08.233 --> 00:35:09.153]  73% mainstream news.
[00:35:09.173 --> 00:35:12.175]  Ron Paul, 73% of the campaign contributions from the military.
[00:35:17.646 --> 00:35:22.988]  All the other candidates combined were only, what, 27, 28 percent.
[00:35:26.189 --> 00:35:26.729]  Think about that.
[00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:33.431]  So, the military doesn't like the FEMA camps.
[00:35:33.471 --> 00:35:35.011]  The military doesn't like the war.
[00:35:35.531 --> 00:35:38.852]  The military doesn't like the new world order.
[00:35:38.872 --> 00:35:42.193]  They love this country and most of them joined for the right reasons, but they're being phased out.
[00:35:42.574 --> 00:35:47.235]  Illegal aliens are being hired and aggravated felons, mainstream news, are replacing their ranks.
[00:35:48.126 --> 00:35:57.535]  And the good guys are getting out, and the psychopaths that like to shoot women and children for no reason, and like to kill little puppies, they're replacing them, and they're coming back and becoming police officers.
[00:35:57.875 --> 00:36:05.022]  And we better have police chiefs, like the Austin Police Chief, who fire bad cops, to weed out the psychopaths.
[00:36:07.184 --> 00:36:08.645]  But most cities, that's not the trend.
[00:36:10.507 --> 00:36:10.707]  Now,
[00:36:11.334 --> 00:36:15.998]  They have... One major reason a lot of cities now are punishing bad cops finally is because of the lawsuits.
[00:36:16.158 --> 00:36:21.462]  The old policy was just stonewall no matter what happens and you don't have to pay the lawsuit.
[00:36:21.482 --> 00:36:26.366]  They kept getting so many bad cops that they thought they had a free reign that they actually started losing more of the cases.
[00:36:26.386 --> 00:36:32.050]  There was a big news article a few years ago with the famous police chief of Detroit talking about it.
[00:36:32.951 --> 00:36:34.492]  So I'm done ranting about that.
[00:36:35.013 --> 00:36:37.635]  Frank, Mark, Elijah, Gary, Chris, Mark, Moe,
[00:36:38.795 --> 00:36:39.936]  Your calls are straight ahead.
[00:36:40.036 --> 00:36:42.077]  Most first, then Mark, Gary, and others.
[00:36:42.997 --> 00:36:43.658]  Stay with us.
[00:36:43.738 --> 00:36:47.420]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are the most censored sites on the web.
[00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:48.461]  Find out why.
[00:36:56.045 --> 00:37:03.189]  Hi, neighbor.
[00:37:03.389 --> 00:37:05.310]  This is Steve Schenck, fearless task force.
[00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:08.372]  Life is a gamble, but you can stack the deck.
[00:37:09.355 --> 00:37:18.617]  If you knew what I know about all the problems food will protect you from, you'd start immediately to put every effort and dollar you can get into the biggest supply of food possible.
[00:37:19.309 --> 00:37:33.498]  When the dollar and economy crash, when the imported and genetically poisoned food is all that's left, when the quarantine and bird flu hit, our only protection and only chance to be fearless is having control of our own supply of food and enough of it.
[00:37:33.778 --> 00:37:41.443]  But if you knew what we haven't yet discovered, you wouldn't waste time listening to the rest of this announcement before charging out and getting a serious food supply.
[00:37:41.463 --> 00:37:44.805]  Decide, it's food now or probably never.
[00:37:45.205 --> 00:37:46.466]  But can you afford to be wrong?
[00:37:47.146 --> 00:37:47.847]  Decide now.
[00:37:48.347 --> 00:37:49.128]  Place your bet.

[00:41:26.273 --> 00:41:28.575]  Your calls are coming up in one moment.
[00:41:29.295 --> 00:41:29.856]  Get ready.
[00:41:29.896 --> 00:41:34.018]  Then we're going to get into more states, consider immigration bills, some good news.
[00:41:34.779 --> 00:41:36.740]  Brett makes cameras and sees through your clothes.
[00:41:38.001 --> 00:41:44.405]  And I got a big stack of documents here on UN forced sterilization programs through vaccines.
[00:41:45.086 --> 00:41:46.527]  Stay with us.
[00:41:46.567 --> 00:41:48.008]  Let's hear a little bit from Junior first.
[00:41:49.037 --> 00:42:03.490]  Ah, but the Animal ID and Premise Society is going to shut down what's left of the family farms.
[00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:08.434]  They want you in the urban centers where they can control you.
[00:42:10.416 --> 00:42:12.638]  Yeah, I can plow a field.
[00:42:13.715 --> 00:42:14.937]  I can skid a buck, I can run a trot line.
[00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:27.691]  We make our own whiskey and our own smoke, too.
[00:42:27.711 --> 00:42:30.812]  Ain't too many things these old boys can't do.
[00:42:30.992 --> 00:42:33.613]  Ain't too many things these old boys can't do.
[00:42:33.993 --> 00:42:35.134]  New Orleans doesn't like that.
[00:42:35.534 --> 00:42:41.296]  We grow good old tomatoes and homemade wine, and country boys can survive.
[00:42:41.736 --> 00:42:44.657]  Country folks can survive.
[00:42:44.677 --> 00:42:47.538]  If you can't starve us out, you can't make us run!
[00:42:48.703 --> 00:42:50.224]  We were raised on shotguns!
[00:42:50.284 --> 00:42:52.386]  Alright, let's go to your calls.
[00:42:52.426 --> 00:42:54.208]  Moe, Oregon, you're on the air.
[00:43:19.687 --> 00:43:23.250]  Yes, thank you very much Mr. Alex for taking my call.
[00:43:23.350 --> 00:43:37.363]  We love your show and everything what you're saying, everything is accurate and I'm an international journalist from Iran and I work with Alex Ansari, your friend in Portland, Oregon.
[00:43:37.403 --> 00:43:37.703]  Yes.
[00:43:37.824 --> 00:43:43.529]  Also, and you know, I would like to bring two things to your attention.
[00:43:44.089 --> 00:43:48.653]  And a recession is two consecutive quarters of job loss.
[00:43:48.813 --> 00:43:49.313]  Exactly.
[00:43:49.333 --> 00:44:00.802]  And again, for those that don't know what a recession and a depression is, a recession is the name of the downward graph into the bottom that is a depression.
[00:44:00.822 --> 00:44:01.002]  Go ahead.
[00:44:14.133 --> 00:44:20.298]  Yes, and another story I have from Arnold, the Terminator in California.
[00:44:20.959 --> 00:44:28.305]  He has signed a new law that in a massive disaster, care will be scarce.
[00:44:28.505 --> 00:44:36.211]  Older, sicker patients could be allowed to die in order to save the lives of patients more likely to survive.
[00:44:36.251 --> 00:44:37.772]  And that's bioethics!
[00:44:38.113 --> 00:44:40.975]  Exactly, and once you have the European model of bioethics,
[00:44:41.295 --> 00:44:42.576]  Which is really eugenics.
[00:44:43.117 --> 00:44:46.439]  Under socialized health care, they're openly saying old people won't get health care.
[00:44:46.719 --> 00:44:48.180]  You cannot make this stuff up.
[00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:50.242]  That's mainstream news.
[00:44:51.083 --> 00:44:51.623]  Exactly.
[00:44:52.684 --> 00:45:08.336]  And it says that it's not the nurse and doctors are accustomed to doing things, nor how Californians expect to be treated, but it is the part of sweeping a statewide plan being praised for its breadth.
[00:45:08.917 --> 00:45:13.179]  Even as Rankles provides, who will have to carry it out?
[00:45:13.299 --> 00:45:18.902]  If the nurse and the doctors refuse, say, no, we want to treat that patient, they will lose their job.
[00:45:19.082 --> 00:45:25.206]  Well, I mean, ten years ago they stopped having doctors, when they got their medical degree, give the Hippocratic Oath to do no harm.
[00:45:26.366 --> 00:45:32.429]  I mean, most major bioethicists are open eugenicists, and call for all this.
[00:45:32.469 --> 00:45:33.590]  Great to hear from you, my friend.
[00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:35.531]  Alex Andrews, a great radio talk show host.
[00:45:36.297 --> 00:45:39.339]  TV show host in his own right, so I'm glad you know my friend.
[00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:41.801]  We're mutual friends down there.
[00:45:42.582 --> 00:45:45.564]  Let's now go ahead and talk to Mark in Nevada.
[00:45:45.584 --> 00:45:46.445]  You're on the air, Mark.
[00:45:46.785 --> 00:45:47.385]  Hey, how are you?
[00:45:47.746 --> 00:45:48.246]  Hello, sir.
[00:45:49.307 --> 00:45:59.354]  Yeah, I just want to go back to your depression talk, because I think, you know, those economic advisors you were talking about, the housing is already in a depression for sure.
[00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:23.836]  I just want to make a connection between all this and Ron Paul, and obviously it's been up, but I think it needs to be reiterated so we can get the man in, whatever it takes, right in, with a housing bubble and a stock bubble, and everybody buying a car and a house that wanted one in the next two or three years, and they bought it ahead of time because there was no payments for two years, whatever.
[00:46:23.876 --> 00:46:27.439]  It's catch-up time, so you've got at least a mild depression.
[00:46:28.374 --> 00:46:30.016]  It's already in the housing, and it's going to go.
[00:46:30.056 --> 00:46:33.119]  Yeah, one out of ten homes now is already upside down.
[00:46:33.919 --> 00:46:38.604]  We have millions and millions of homes going belly up, people walking away.
[00:46:38.624 --> 00:46:41.206]  Yeah, we're in Vegas, and that's the crux of it.
[00:46:41.226 --> 00:46:42.327]  That's the worst place.
[00:46:42.748 --> 00:46:46.752]  You know, The Economist, every time The Economist talks about housing problems, we're in there.
[00:46:46.952 --> 00:46:48.753]  Arizona, Minnesota, Florida.
[00:46:48.793 --> 00:46:49.334]  Yeah, Florida.
[00:46:50.355 --> 00:46:52.257]  But my point is that if we have
[00:46:53.400 --> 00:47:00.185]  You know, one thing we should be focusing on to get Rod and Paul in there is obviously McCain's cluelessness on economics, and he admitted such.
[00:47:00.825 --> 00:47:06.069]  But to look at, you know, I don't want us to be in a depression, but we're going there.
[00:47:06.629 --> 00:47:13.354]  And since we're going there, we've got to reiterate, and we all saw him teaching Ben Bernanke, the most powerful finance man on the planet.
[00:47:13.374 --> 00:47:17.357]  Yeah, Bernanke's telling Paul in the House Banking Committee, the Congressman's saying,
[00:47:18.015 --> 00:47:23.480]  Bernanke's still saying we have 2.3 percent inflation when every index says it's at least above 10.
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:24.621]  You're absolutely right.
[00:47:25.381 --> 00:47:29.005]  I mean, that's the type of bull the Federal Reserve shovels at the general public.
[00:47:30.186 --> 00:47:35.951]  Look, Ron Paul is not going to be president, but he's one in injecting real ideas, real information.
[00:47:35.991 --> 00:47:37.392]  People know about the inflation tax.
[00:47:37.412 --> 00:47:38.773]  They know about the North American Union.
[00:47:40.454 --> 00:47:40.875]  What is
[00:47:41.804 --> 00:47:47.286]  Hillary saying she wants forced socialized health care, where CPS will take your kids if you don't have the government insurance.
[00:47:47.606 --> 00:47:50.847]  Then with the government insurance, the government can force you to go under what care they want.
[00:47:51.187 --> 00:47:51.867]  That's the model.
[00:47:53.448 --> 00:47:54.468]  Rationing of care.
[00:47:54.648 --> 00:47:55.468]  Total control.
[00:47:55.728 --> 00:47:57.929]  We don't need more government, we need less government.
[00:47:57.969 --> 00:47:58.809]  We're already bankrupt.
[00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:03.430]  And between Hillary and McCain and Obama, there's no difference.
[00:48:04.151 --> 00:48:06.912]  I mean, these are all open border, gun control scum.
[00:48:08.212 --> 00:48:08.532]  Period.
[00:48:10.355 --> 00:48:13.037]  The country had a chance to go for Ron Paul, but the media cheated him.
[00:48:13.278 --> 00:48:21.545]  Look, if you believe Ron Paul really got 5% of the vote in Texas when he got 70% of the vote, 70% in his district, trounced his opponent, 70-30.
[00:48:21.565 --> 00:48:29.353]  I mean, do you really believe Ron Paul got 5% in Texas with the blimps and the signs and the TV and radio ads?
[00:48:30.794 --> 00:48:31.675]  That's pure bull.
[00:48:33.257 --> 00:48:34.638]  We have caught them in election fraud.
[00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:37.792]  There is Diebold-type systems in most of the country.
[00:48:38.033 --> 00:48:38.753]  They've been caught!
[00:48:38.793 --> 00:48:40.355]  Their executives have gone to jail!
[00:48:40.755 --> 00:48:42.777]  We said there was fraud in Ohio in 2004!
[00:48:43.558 --> 00:48:44.699]  People went to prison for it!
[00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:46.160]  It's real!
[00:48:47.201 --> 00:48:48.102]  You go, what do we do then?
[00:48:48.142 --> 00:48:52.526]  You continue to vote to go prove it's a fraud and diagram it and track it and expose it.
[00:48:53.427 --> 00:48:55.429]  Let's go ahead now and take another call.
[00:48:56.050 --> 00:48:57.811]  Let's talk to Gary in Austin.
[00:48:57.851 --> 00:48:59.453]  You're on the air, Gary.
[00:49:00.541 --> 00:49:01.722]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[00:49:01.862 --> 00:49:02.703]  Pleasure to talk to you.
[00:49:02.863 --> 00:49:03.704]  Pleasure to talk to you.
[00:49:03.904 --> 00:49:07.087]  I got two questions and I'll take your comments off the air.
[00:49:08.108 --> 00:49:08.989]  First question is this.
[00:49:09.929 --> 00:49:27.525]  At what point do we, the people, stop allowing what the government dictates to us, and we, the 80 million plus gun owners in this United States, stand up and start dictating to the United States government that it better get back to the Constitution or hell's a coming?
[00:49:28.047 --> 00:49:29.928]  Well, they know that hell is coming.
[00:49:29.948 --> 00:49:38.272]  There's more than a hundred million gun owners, so that's over a million armed combatants in the streets, and only 1% actually decide to fight.
[00:49:38.653 --> 00:49:39.693]  I don't want that to happen.
[00:49:39.733 --> 00:49:42.815]  They're geared up and ready for that, and they'll claim we're terrorists.
[00:49:42.895 --> 00:49:46.837]  I want to peacefully take the government back, but what do you do if they stage a terror attack?
[00:49:47.477 --> 00:49:54.881]  I was talking to a former Special Forces guy yesterday who's involved in international business, and I've actually run into him a few times over the years.
[00:49:54.901 --> 00:49:56.302]  We have some joint acquaintances.
[00:49:57.034 --> 00:50:02.535]  And he just said, look Alex, a nuke's going to go off and then the tolerance for people like you is over.
[00:50:02.895 --> 00:50:04.575]  And I said, you know who's going to be behind that nuke?
[00:50:04.595 --> 00:50:05.816]  And he basically laughed at me.
[00:50:05.836 --> 00:50:06.996]  You know, it's real funny.
[00:50:07.476 --> 00:50:10.716]  You see, they set a nuke off and then they pose as the saviors.
[00:50:10.736 --> 00:50:11.476]  You understand how that works?
[00:50:12.537 --> 00:50:12.757]  Right.
[00:50:13.457 --> 00:50:22.838]  Let me follow up on that just by making an analogy that I think that the airplane is at the point of no return and it's either we land or we crash.
[00:50:23.599 --> 00:50:26.139]  Second question I want to get to real fast if you don't mind.
[00:50:26.807 --> 00:50:40.900]  What's your personal philosophical belief that what is happening in our country and around the world today has a lot to do with the prophecies of Daniel and what's in Revelation?
[00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:42.621]  And I'll take my answer off the air.
[00:50:42.661 --> 00:50:43.222]  Thank you very much.
[00:50:43.262 --> 00:50:43.762]  Thank you, sir.
[00:50:43.802 --> 00:50:44.183]  Thank you.
[00:50:44.743 --> 00:50:53.071]  Number one, it is such a hot-button issue that most Christians in America are bought and paid for by Council on Foreign Relations, World Council of Churches.
[00:50:53.723 --> 00:50:57.146]  Where they tell you there's going to be a rapture and you're going to be pulled out of it and you don't have to face any evil.
[00:50:57.686 --> 00:50:59.828]  People in Germany being killed thought it was the rapture.
[00:51:00.588 --> 00:51:02.150]  The Seventh-day Adventists thought it was.
[00:51:02.930 --> 00:51:04.471]  The Baptists thought it was.
[00:51:05.172 --> 00:51:07.454]  That wasn't taught until a hundred years ago at Schofield.
[00:51:08.835 --> 00:51:11.537]  And regardless, I have a duty to fight evil.
[00:51:11.717 --> 00:51:12.398]  I am a Christian.
[00:51:13.138 --> 00:51:21.124]  I think that what we see developing in the world with them wanting you to face scan or thumb scan to buy and sell and the cashless society, it all mirrors what's in the Bible.
[00:51:22.105 --> 00:51:23.046]  I mean, really closely.
[00:51:23.883 --> 00:51:26.644]  And so, yeah, you've got to look at that and you've got to consider all that.
[00:51:26.664 --> 00:51:31.226]  But a lot of people then cop out and say, well, then I'm just going to praise God, the world's about to end.
[00:51:32.206 --> 00:51:34.467]  All I know is evil's coming for us, it's hurting innocents.
[00:51:34.988 --> 00:51:37.028]  We've got to fight it and stand up against it in the info war.
[00:51:37.048 --> 00:51:38.989]  And I don't want to have a physical confrontation.
[00:51:39.209 --> 00:51:42.311]  But don't worry, they're going to start it like Lexington and Concord in 1775.
[00:51:42.951 --> 00:51:44.952]  More calls, tons of news, second hour after the news.
[00:51:44.992 --> 00:51:45.432]  Stay with us.
[00:51:52.754 --> 00:51:53.814]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[00:52:26.432 --> 00:52:28.333]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:52:29.054 --> 00:52:32.216]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:52:32.877 --> 00:52:39.341]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.

[00:53:22.932 --> 00:53:42.182]  In the final segment today, coming up in about 15 minutes, I'm going to air some excerpts of my interview that I had Thursday with CNN's own Lou Dobbs.
[00:53:43.343 --> 00:53:45.084]  Then I'm going to talk about the New World Order.
[00:53:46.078 --> 00:53:48.019]  He said there's going to be a revolution against the Alita.
[00:53:48.039 --> 00:53:48.939]  They don't back off.
[00:53:48.959 --> 00:53:50.779]  And a lot of other amazing things.
[00:53:50.799 --> 00:53:53.620]  Talk about how we're going into inflationary depression.
[00:53:54.321 --> 00:53:56.141]  The central banks don't turn around what they're doing.
[00:53:56.161 --> 00:54:05.164]  This is a continued amazing guess that Trey, who's also running the Sunday show in there right now with Paul, are getting for the show.
[00:54:06.343 --> 00:54:12.087]  We had some big guests on this one, too, the Sunday edition, but this is more of a kind of weekly wrap-up, looking forward to the new week here.
[00:54:12.647 --> 00:54:17.170]  All right, I want to get into more state-considered immigration bills, as the feds are doing the opposite.
[00:54:17.710 --> 00:54:19.191]  Also get into some Big Brother news.
[00:54:19.231 --> 00:54:23.333]  Got a big stack of research here of how the U.N.
[00:54:23.373 --> 00:54:28.336]  and others have been caught adding different vaccines to sterilize women.
[00:54:28.977 --> 00:54:32.439]  They even forced the women to have shots while they're pregnant to kill their babies.
[00:54:33.291 --> 00:54:37.472]  This is the folks that run our planet, the control freaks that are running things that are engaged in this.
[00:54:38.012 --> 00:54:39.632]  But people have been holding long enough.
[00:54:39.692 --> 00:54:41.153]  We've got loaded phones continually.
[00:54:42.053 --> 00:54:52.975]  You can call in when you hear somebody hang up at 877-590-5525, or locally, we're listening to our mothership that we bring you this program from across the country, 836-0590, and that 0590 is for KLBJ 590, NewsRadio 590-KLBJ.
[00:54:52.995 --> 00:54:54.776]  Okay, let's go back to the calls.
[00:55:03.039 --> 00:55:06.041]  We're going to skip ahead to some people calling from other nations on their line.
[00:55:06.401 --> 00:55:09.604]  Dr. Chris in New Zealand, and Sean in Belfast, Ireland.
[00:55:09.844 --> 00:55:12.486]  We'll go to Elijah, Chris, Mark, Russell, and others.
[00:55:13.267 --> 00:55:15.729]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in New Zealand.
[00:55:15.749 --> 00:55:16.310]  You're on the air.
[00:55:17.731 --> 00:55:17.831]  Hi.
[00:55:17.891 --> 00:55:18.452]  G'day, Alex.
[00:55:18.532 --> 00:55:18.912]  How are you?
[00:55:19.092 --> 00:55:19.592]  Good day, sir.
[00:55:19.633 --> 00:55:20.073]  Doing fine.
[00:55:20.911 --> 00:55:21.411]  Brilliant.
[00:55:21.431 --> 00:55:22.852]  Look, you're doing some great stuff.
[00:55:22.912 --> 00:55:24.293]  Keep it up, mate.
[00:55:24.894 --> 00:55:26.114]  It's getting out all over the world.
[00:55:26.174 --> 00:55:28.656]  I don't know how many units.
[00:55:28.696 --> 00:55:33.539]  You're aware of how many people in New Zealand, Australia, are listening to your DVDs, your videos, what have you?
[00:55:34.019 --> 00:55:35.560]  Well, let me give you... I mean, are you asking a question?
[00:55:35.580 --> 00:55:36.181]  Do you want me to tell you?
[00:55:36.861 --> 00:55:37.161]  Yeah.
[00:55:37.341 --> 00:55:38.802]  Okay, well, let me just give you an idea.
[00:55:38.942 --> 00:55:45.907]  I don't sell a lot of DVDs, a lot of books, okay, compared to... I mean, I sell tens of thousands a year.
[00:55:46.545 --> 00:56:01.650]  Compared to, I put up basically any video, or my listeners put video to my radio show, those literally are getting tens of millions of views that we can track a day on Google, YouTube, LiveLeak, and BlipTV, the rest of them.
[00:56:02.611 --> 00:56:03.811]  Literally millions a day.
[00:56:04.568 --> 00:56:07.230]  Hundreds of millions every few weeks, every month, conservatively.
[00:56:07.551 --> 00:56:11.614]  I mean, I have, you know, one film on the web that we know has gotten more than 50 million views.
[00:56:12.455 --> 00:56:13.035]  Terror Storm.
[00:56:13.556 --> 00:56:15.097]  So, that's just one film.
[00:56:15.577 --> 00:56:16.919]  And so, it is insane.
[00:56:17.059 --> 00:56:25.386]  I mean, we see the stats coming in from China, Europe, Mexico, Chile, Brazil, South Africa.
[00:56:26.807 --> 00:56:28.448]  Just, just, I mean, it's incredible.
[00:56:28.488 --> 00:56:30.310]  So, we have no way of gauging it all.
[00:56:30.370 --> 00:56:32.812]  We just know, and it's exponential.
[00:56:33.602 --> 00:56:36.044]  I mean, I'm really freaked out now.
[00:56:36.064 --> 00:56:43.609]  You know, I've been doing radio for 13 years, TV for 13 years, and I got to where I almost fall asleep on air.
[00:56:43.629 --> 00:56:48.533]  I mean, I do it so much that I'm totally calm, I'm relaxed, I never get butterflies, and I did 10-12 years ago.
[00:56:48.633 --> 00:56:52.315]  Now I get butterflies every day on the show, because I realize, my God!
[00:56:52.335 --> 00:57:00.221]  I mean, there are so many people listening to me, including the Japanese Parliament, and well-known billionaires, and generals, and
[00:57:00.875 --> 00:57:01.555]  Hollywood.
[00:57:01.776 --> 00:57:02.896]  And I'm nobody.
[00:57:02.916 --> 00:57:03.917]  I'm just an average person.
[00:57:03.957 --> 00:57:08.379]  But yes, we've hit the zeitgeist and the show is just exponentially exploding.
[00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:10.860]  Good on you.
[00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:12.221]  You're making a difference out there, mate.
[00:57:12.241 --> 00:57:13.341]  You're making a major difference.
[00:57:13.421 --> 00:57:15.783]  Because of people like you, sir, spreading the word.
[00:57:17.203 --> 00:57:18.084]  Well, keep doing it, mate.
[00:57:19.304 --> 00:57:20.005]  All the very best.
[00:57:20.265 --> 00:57:20.725]  Well, thank you.
[00:57:20.745 --> 00:57:21.265]  Is that it, sir?
[00:57:22.066 --> 00:57:24.827]  Yeah, just phoned up to say well done and keep it up.
[00:57:25.147 --> 00:57:25.848]  Thank you, my friend.
[00:57:25.868 --> 00:57:26.488]  Good to hear from you.
[00:57:26.808 --> 00:57:27.989]  Sean in Belfast, Ireland.
[00:57:28.009 --> 00:57:28.449]  You're on the air.
[00:57:29.266 --> 00:57:29.826]  Hello, Alex.
[00:57:30.006 --> 00:57:30.467]  Hello, sir.
[00:57:31.147 --> 00:57:32.768]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:57:33.188 --> 00:57:33.608]  Thank you.
[00:57:34.329 --> 00:57:39.071]  Alex, I have been a listener to yours for around one year.
[00:57:39.091 --> 00:57:41.313]  Hello?
[00:57:41.353 --> 00:57:42.934]  Yes, sir.
[00:57:43.174 --> 00:57:48.917]  I just have a few questions to ask you in regards to William Cooper.
[00:57:49.237 --> 00:57:49.937]  Is that okay?
[00:57:50.117 --> 00:57:50.638]  Sure, go ahead.
[00:57:51.338 --> 00:57:58.222]  Okay, just doing a bit of research into the New World Order, I came across this guy, William Cooper.
[00:57:59.456 --> 00:58:07.481]  I was just wondering what are your views on William Cooper's views on the New World Order?
[00:58:08.402 --> 00:58:28.375]  William Cooper, Bill Cooper, very talented fella, very angry though in his last few years, just screaming, cussing, yelling at everybody that would call up and talk to him, and kind of turned into an egomaniac, and got, I think, unstable under the pressure or whatever it was.
[00:58:28.914 --> 00:58:31.335]  And he attacked me a lot his last few years.
[00:58:31.775 --> 00:58:31.955]  Yeah.
[00:58:32.195 --> 00:58:38.897]  I think out of jealousy or something and I was very sad whenever he got gunned down by that SWAT team in Arizona.
[00:58:39.358 --> 00:58:39.558]  Yeah.
[00:58:39.798 --> 00:58:42.819]  And I just really don't respond to it or attack him.
[00:58:43.079 --> 00:58:47.660]  You know, he would say that my info wasn't accurate and then misconstrue it and twist it, which is fine.
[00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:49.801]  This is really a whole thing's a distraction right now.
[00:58:49.821 --> 00:58:50.501]  It's not about me.
[00:58:50.702 --> 00:58:52.062]  It's about you checking out what I claim.
[00:58:52.282 --> 00:58:54.583]  But then he would write books about UFOs running everything.
[00:58:54.643 --> 00:58:56.423]  So, see, I'm not a UFOlogist.
[00:58:56.504 --> 00:58:57.864]  I don't get into things you can't prove.
[00:58:58.655 --> 00:59:02.156]  Everything I'm saying here is open source and out in the open.
[00:59:02.496 --> 00:59:11.117]  Bills, legislation, court rulings, documents, and I'm not in this to be the big kahuna.
[00:59:11.257 --> 00:59:12.778]  I am the big kahuna, unfortunately.
[00:59:12.798 --> 00:59:13.858]  It's a very dangerous position.
[00:59:14.678 --> 00:59:21.639]  But Bill was the big kahuna, and I guess he flipped out when I took the poll position from him.
[00:59:22.539 --> 00:59:26.500]  Alex, also, could I ask you, what was your opinion
[00:59:27.418 --> 00:59:31.662]  On his opinions concerning the JFK assassination?
[00:59:31.962 --> 00:59:33.163]  I have to be honest with you.
[00:59:33.283 --> 00:59:37.487]  I was never... I was a fan of his delivery and he was great.
[00:59:37.847 --> 00:59:41.150]  I probably listened to his show ten times and I always found it to be very interesting.
[00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:46.875]  But I didn't really follow Bill and I only interviewed him once and he was cussing so much on air I was delaying it out.
[00:59:46.895 --> 00:59:48.537]  That's why nobody heard the cussing dummies.
[00:59:48.757 --> 00:59:52.380]  People then heard the radio show and said, we didn't hear cussing because I was delaying him out.
[00:59:53.212 --> 00:59:56.493]  Uh, and I don't believe that the driver turned around and shot Kennedy.
[00:59:56.513 --> 00:59:58.853]  Uh, and the video doesn't show that.
[00:59:59.573 --> 01:00:02.614]  And again, I don't want to talk bad about Bill, but you asked me my opinion.
[01:00:03.054 --> 01:00:04.434]  Just so much of what he said was bull.
[01:00:05.074 --> 01:00:07.475]  So, I mean, you know, that's really what it boils down to at the end of the day.
[01:00:07.735 --> 01:00:09.035]  Let's jam in one more here.
[01:00:09.375 --> 01:00:10.456]  Elijah in Austin.
[01:00:10.476 --> 01:00:11.076]  You're on the air.
[01:00:11.096 --> 01:00:12.376]  How you doing today?
[01:00:12.616 --> 01:00:12.876]  Good.
[01:00:13.656 --> 01:00:13.936]  Awesome.
[01:00:14.516 --> 01:00:17.437]  Um, not a longtime listener, but I've definitely watched you.
[01:00:17.477 --> 01:00:18.557]  I'm from your hometown.
[01:00:19.197 --> 01:00:22.658]  And I don't really much have a question, but some comments and maybe a little critique.
[01:00:24.089 --> 01:00:31.793]  I feel that we should all take personal accountability and responsibility for our own lives, and in our communities, it's going to affect us the greatest.
[01:00:32.293 --> 01:00:36.695]  If you're not taking this time right now to prepare yourself for what's going to happen, you're wasting it.
[01:00:37.396 --> 01:00:48.522]  I agree that we do need to get the information out, and everybody needs to know what's going on, but more so, we need to prepare under the seven Ps prior to proper planning to prevent fifth floor performance, because
[01:00:49.133 --> 01:00:56.998]  It's going to be in our face, and if you can't deal with it in your face, nobody in the government, nobody in the Congress, nobody anywhere is going to be able to solve your own problem.
[01:00:57.018 --> 01:01:02.281]  Hey, I agree, my friend, and I probably haven't prepared as much as I should for a coming depression.
[01:01:02.341 --> 01:01:03.982]  If it's going to happen, I hope it doesn't happen.
[01:01:04.402 --> 01:01:05.223]  Well, it's going to happen.
[01:01:05.263 --> 01:01:06.423]  I mean, it's natural.
[01:01:06.524 --> 01:01:13.848]  It's going to take place, and if you don't have a garden, if you don't have a compost, if you don't have a rain catch system, and if you don't have your house paid off,
[01:01:14.352 --> 01:01:15.792]  You're going to be one of the people in the streets.
[01:01:15.812 --> 01:01:16.832]  Well, here's the bigger problem.
[01:01:16.892 --> 01:01:18.073]  Well, it's going to happen to me now.
[01:01:18.173 --> 01:01:19.093]  Here's the bigger problem.
[01:01:20.133 --> 01:01:23.394]  The people in the streets are going to come wanting what you've got.
[01:01:24.094 --> 01:01:25.774]  And that's when you say, hey, you know what?
[01:01:25.874 --> 01:01:26.834]  I'm prepared for that.
[01:01:27.254 --> 01:01:28.154]  I have a house right by 35.
[01:01:28.735 --> 01:01:32.875]  I know that that place is going to get jam-packed when the F hits the fan.
[01:01:33.175 --> 01:01:36.476]  People are going to trickle through my neighborhood and try and take what I've got.
[01:01:36.496 --> 01:01:38.636]  And I'm going to defend it every step of the way.
[01:01:38.916 --> 01:01:39.616]  Defend my family.
[01:01:39.636 --> 01:01:40.657]  Okay, get to your criticisms.
[01:01:40.677 --> 01:01:41.857]  Get to your criticisms.
[01:01:41.877 --> 01:01:42.477]  We're about to break.
[01:01:43.536 --> 01:01:47.298]  I just think, you know, less time in talking and more time in action, you know?
[01:01:47.518 --> 01:01:48.098]  Sure, I hear you.
[01:01:48.178 --> 01:01:49.939]  Listen, I'm a radio talk show host, sir.
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:51.160]  I'm a filmmaker.
[01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:51.860]  That's what I do.
[01:01:52.721 --> 01:01:58.304]  Okay, I literally, with your help, you know, we have woken up a large segment of the planet.
[01:01:58.584 --> 01:01:59.844]  You have to wake them up first.
[01:02:00.905 --> 01:02:03.887]  You know, I mean, have you ever worked 18 hours in one day?
[01:02:04.847 --> 01:02:06.228]  I did it last year.
[01:02:06.268 --> 01:02:07.088]  I'm not doing it anymore.
[01:02:07.108 --> 01:02:08.509]  It almost broke me, physically.
[01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:12.331]  I do everything I can, including
[01:02:13.323 --> 01:02:17.246]  Giving money to charity and buying kids hospital beds and meals on wheels.
[01:02:17.287 --> 01:02:18.067]  You don't know what I do.
[01:02:19.388 --> 01:02:20.229]  And soup kitchens.
[01:02:21.290 --> 01:02:23.292]  I mean, I'd get down there on the ground.
[01:02:24.553 --> 01:02:27.736]  So, I just, I can't do any more.
[01:02:28.436 --> 01:02:31.439]  But I agree with the points you made earlier, but please don't criticize me.
[01:02:31.459 --> 01:02:32.580]  This is just stupid.
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:35.122]  Alright, we'll be right back with tons more calls.
[01:02:36.279 --> 01:02:37.180]  Very important news.
[01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:38.660]  On the other side, stay with us.
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:40.101]  It is a big idea.
[01:02:40.181 --> 01:02:41.261]  A new world order.
[01:02:41.301 --> 01:02:45.143]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful government.
[01:03:04.672 --> 01:03:11.695]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:19.838]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:27.741]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:03:28.261 --> 01:03:31.683]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:03:32.123 --> 01:03:34.644]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:03:34.685 --> 01:03:35.825]  Most people have no idea.
[01:03:35.845 --> 01:03:36.606]  They're not after money.
[01:03:36.626 --> 01:03:37.686]  They have all the money they need.
[01:03:37.706 --> 01:03:38.627]  They're after power.
[01:03:38.887 --> 01:03:39.907]  That's what they're after.
[01:03:40.027 --> 01:03:44.570]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[01:03:44.790 --> 01:03:48.211]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:03:48.332 --> 01:03:49.112]  Endgame.
[01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:51.553]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:03:51.573 --> 01:03:52.694]  You have been warned.
[01:03:54.187 --> 01:03:54.688]  Hi, neighbor.
[01:03:54.988 --> 01:03:57.769]  They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[01:03:58.309 --> 01:04:03.031]  Certainly we'd never intend to procrastinate getting our own food supply until there was none left at any price.
[01:04:03.591 --> 01:04:08.733]  We would intend to have plenty of food so the relief organizations could care for those unable to care for themselves.
[01:04:09.334 --> 01:04:16.417]  We would intend not to be standing in the bread line with the ignorant and the foolish who pretend the facts of food disappearance are untrue.
[01:04:16.937 --> 01:04:21.839]  If the experience of the Katrina disaster is evidence, the bread line may have no bread.
[01:04:22.459 --> 01:04:29.521]  Just like the good intentions on the road to that unheavenly place, the good intentions alone to get a supply of food will not feed us.
[01:04:30.261 --> 01:04:34.703]  Only getting a food supply immediately will make us independent and fearless for the future.
[01:04:34.723 --> 01:04:35.663]  Call 800-409-5633.
[01:04:35.683 --> 01:04:35.723]  800-409-5633.

[01:04:36.763 --> 01:04:37.043]  Who am I?
[01:04:37.063 --> 01:04:37.183]  Nobody.
[01:04:37.203 --> 01:04:37.784]  Steve Shane.
[01:04:54.187 --> 01:04:59.289]  Ten Enters from Midas March 3rd 2008 Gold 981 20 ounce gold coins can be purchased for $1,898 or $96.80 per half $248.40 per quarter.
[01:04:59.309 --> 01:04:59.789]  That's $1,898 or $96.80 and $248.40.
[01:05:09.272 --> 01:05:15.115]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[01:05:15.175 --> 01:05:19.397]  treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing the Yon revolution.
[01:05:19.677 --> 01:05:27.962]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[01:05:28.002 --> 01:05:30.523]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[01:05:30.783 --> 01:05:34.585]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[01:05:34.785 --> 01:05:41.048]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.
[01:05:41.368 --> 01:05:44.810]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[01:05:44.850 --> 01:05:47.951]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in the global game of chess.
[01:05:48.031 --> 01:05:48.272]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:05:48.312 --> 01:05:48.492]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:05:54.239 --> 01:06:06.973]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:06:07.394 --> 01:06:14.121]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[01:06:14.481 --> 01:06:18.063]  And the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:06:18.443 --> 01:06:21.625]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[01:06:21.845 --> 01:06:23.546]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[01:06:23.606 --> 01:06:29.350]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[01:06:45.379 --> 01:06:47.600]  We're in a no-holds-barred information war.
[01:06:48.001 --> 01:06:53.344]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[01:06:57.406 --> 01:06:59.807]  Are you tired of searching for great talk radio?
[01:06:59.868 --> 01:07:00.888]  Well, search no more.
[01:07:01.128 --> 01:07:03.189]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:07.828 --> 01:07:09.669]  Alright, let's move quickly back into your calls.
[01:07:09.689 --> 01:07:11.410]  We're taking a lot of calls today.
[01:07:11.450 --> 01:07:13.150]  Big news bulletin coming up in the next segment.
[01:07:13.170 --> 01:07:19.033]  We'll talk about one angle that mainstream media is using to try to demonize the internet.
[01:07:19.233 --> 01:07:22.615]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jim in Missouri.
[01:07:23.395 --> 01:07:24.295]  Jim, you're on the air.
[01:07:25.376 --> 01:07:25.656]  Alex?
[01:07:25.856 --> 01:07:26.196]  Yes, sir.
[01:07:27.137 --> 01:07:28.437]  Listen, I want to preface this.
[01:07:28.617 --> 01:07:33.159]  If I say something that you don't want passed over the airwaves, stop me, okay?
[01:07:34.969 --> 01:07:39.591]  You know about what occurred in Texas after the primary?
[01:07:42.213 --> 01:07:43.193]  What occurred in Texas?
[01:07:43.273 --> 01:07:44.314]  A lot happened in Texas.
[01:07:44.614 --> 01:07:47.656]  The conventions that occurred.
[01:07:48.776 --> 01:07:52.478]  They were swamped by Ron Paul people and they took it.
[01:07:52.898 --> 01:07:53.358]  I knew that.
[01:07:53.479 --> 01:08:02.743]  I knew that in several states that Ron Paul delegates, even though he didn't get that many votes, more people showed up to be delegates who were Ron Paul supporters.
[01:08:02.803 --> 01:08:03.944]  So how does that extrapolate?
[01:08:04.398 --> 01:08:05.899]  Okay, now listen to this.
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:11.244]  You saw Ron Paul's video on Thursday, and then Jesse Benton's statement on Friday.
[01:08:11.464 --> 01:08:14.607]  That he's not dropping out, but the mainstream media is saying he is.
[01:08:15.127 --> 01:08:18.770]  Well, but the mainstream media took it as that he was.
[01:08:19.751 --> 01:08:22.093]  Okay, now this is pure political strategy.
[01:08:22.153 --> 01:08:22.534]  No, I know.
[01:08:22.574 --> 01:08:24.255]  He's not dropping out, but they're saying he is.
[01:08:24.295 --> 01:08:25.076]  No, no.
[01:08:25.857 --> 01:08:30.961]  This is the first time we got the mainstream media to do something for the revolution.
[01:08:31.966 --> 01:08:34.268]  They bought it hook, line, and sinker.
[01:08:34.608 --> 01:08:40.372]  That was a ploy to get everybody off of what was happening in Texas.
[01:08:40.812 --> 01:08:44.534]  The GOP on a national basis is scared to death.
[01:08:44.975 --> 01:08:46.676]  They've figured out what we're doing.
[01:08:48.057 --> 01:08:49.918]  And Ron Paul... Here's the deal, sir.
[01:08:49.998 --> 01:09:01.586]  If you've got 10% of the vote, you can't go into a brokered convention and demand that your candidate be the nominee if you don't have the majority of the delegates, even if you have people who've gone and filled those delegate positions.
[01:09:02.131 --> 01:09:02.851]  That's the key.
[01:09:03.091 --> 01:09:06.732]  You've got to have the majority of the delegates, and we're working on that.
[01:09:07.372 --> 01:09:09.012]  But it's political suicide.
[01:09:09.372 --> 01:09:11.933]  You can't go take people's delegates in that name.
[01:09:12.593 --> 01:09:14.833]  People aren't listening to me on this Broker Convention business.
[01:09:15.353 --> 01:09:16.494]  They've had Broker Conventions.
[01:09:16.514 --> 01:09:18.114]  The last one was in the late 1940s.
[01:09:19.614 --> 01:09:28.516]  And that was where the candidate had a few points less than the other candidate, and politically, you can't go then, quote, steal the election, because the popular vote is
[01:09:30.376 --> 01:09:32.598]  Sacrosanct, and that's what the delegates are supposed to follow.
[01:09:33.298 --> 01:09:34.939]  I don't mind trying to get in a fight with you listeners.
[01:09:34.959 --> 01:09:44.925]  I know you want Ron Paul to win, but he can't have, you know, 6, 7, 8, 9 percent of the vote and have maybe 60, 70 delegates, and then McCain's got a thousand, and then our nominee's Ron Paul.
[01:09:47.547 --> 01:09:50.729]  I really think there's some rearranging of deck chairs on the Titanic going on here.
[01:09:50.769 --> 01:09:51.750]  I'm just trying to be honest here.
[01:09:52.851 --> 01:09:53.271]  Oh, boy.
[01:09:53.931 --> 01:09:55.492]  Let's talk to Chris in Kentucky.
[01:09:55.512 --> 01:09:56.313]  Chris, you're on the air.
[01:09:56.893 --> 01:09:57.313]  Hey, Alex.
[01:09:57.333 --> 01:09:57.674]  How you doing?
[01:09:58.949 --> 01:10:06.372]  I just want to, you know, you were bringing up the police state and all the other things that we had with Katrina and all the, with the emergency management.
[01:10:06.452 --> 01:10:13.774]  Now snowstorms, we just had a massive snowstorm here and we had emergency management out this weekend saying anybody out on the streets will be arrested.
[01:10:13.814 --> 01:10:14.735]  They said that on the news.
[01:10:14.775 --> 01:10:15.895]  Yeah, I saw that in the news.
[01:10:15.975 --> 01:10:21.097]  It's all excuses to crack down and go into this police state mode, which they never had before.
[01:10:21.758 --> 01:10:25.479]  Yeah, and that's just our freedoms, you know, and this is the conditioning method.
[01:10:25.499 --> 01:10:32.081]  So if we do have a tornado or some major disaster, people are sure going to be in trouble, because they're conditioning.
[01:10:32.121 --> 01:10:34.922]  And again, it all sounds reasonable, but it's about training us for it.
[01:10:35.202 --> 01:10:41.905]  They have hired 26,000 preachers, mainstream news now, training their flock to hand their guns in, to go to FEMA camps when they're told.
[01:10:42.285 --> 01:10:44.045]  That means they're seriously considering doing it.
[01:10:44.965 --> 01:10:49.487]  Yep, and it's just like these corporate churches, like Southeast Christian Church, I've heard that they're part of that.
[01:10:50.791 --> 01:10:51.112]  40,000 members.
[01:10:51.432 --> 01:10:52.052]  It's incredible.
[01:10:52.252 --> 01:10:52.452]  I know.
[01:10:52.492 --> 01:10:54.053]  The government is just all over.
[01:10:54.113 --> 01:10:56.275]  I mean, look, in New Orleans, they didn't bring food and water.
[01:10:56.515 --> 01:10:57.495]  They came and took the guns.
[01:10:58.756 --> 01:11:02.158]  And if you don't know about that, just Google New Orleans gun confiscation.
[01:11:02.178 --> 01:11:03.078]  They did it statewide.
[01:11:03.319 --> 01:11:05.720]  You can watch them go into high and dry mansions and take their guns.
[01:11:07.241 --> 01:11:07.841]  Unbelievable.
[01:11:08.441 --> 01:11:09.762]  Mark in Washington.
[01:11:09.822 --> 01:11:10.923]  You're on the air.
[01:11:11.483 --> 01:11:11.883]  Welcome.
[01:11:13.865 --> 01:11:14.065]  Alex?
[01:11:14.245 --> 01:11:14.465]  Yes, sir.
[01:11:15.659 --> 01:11:17.900]  Okay, I just heard a scratching sound.
[01:11:17.941 --> 01:11:18.681]  That's what it does.
[01:11:18.921 --> 01:11:23.744]  With talk radio boxes, when you put something on air, it goes... That's to let you know you're on air.
[01:11:23.784 --> 01:11:24.084]  Go ahead.
[01:11:25.085 --> 01:11:26.265]  On Martin Luther King Jr.
[01:11:26.305 --> 01:11:30.388]  Day, the stock markets, you know, basically crumbled all over the world.
[01:11:31.088 --> 01:11:35.390]  And I was watching it on the news, and I wanted to figure out what was going on.
[01:11:35.410 --> 01:11:37.372]  Well, Greenspan came out and said, dump the dollars.
[01:11:37.992 --> 01:11:45.036]  Yeah, and I asked the Lord to lead me to the right sources of information to understand what's going on.
[01:11:45.492 --> 01:11:51.997]  So I went on YouTube, and I found your site, and I also found this other site called Patriot Radio News.
[01:11:52.577 --> 01:11:53.798]  I'm not sure if you've heard of that.
[01:11:53.918 --> 01:11:54.099]  No.
[01:11:54.279 --> 01:11:59.042]  But on Thursday, February 28th, they had Pastor Lindsey Williams on there.
[01:11:59.503 --> 01:12:02.165]  Yeah, talking about the energy non-crisis.
[01:12:02.685 --> 01:12:02.885]  Yeah.
[01:12:02.905 --> 01:12:03.926]  The fact that there's 200 plus years.
[01:12:05.641 --> 01:12:10.566]  Of sweet, light crude in one oil field in Prudhoe Bay, and that's been in mainstream news.
[01:12:10.926 --> 01:12:12.668]  And the big oil companies don't want that to flow.
[01:12:12.688 --> 01:12:23.618]  They're creating artificial scarcity, just like the documents have come out and the APs reported that the oil companies from 1995 to 2001 bought up 200-plus refineries and shut them down to create an artificial bottleneck.
[01:12:23.638 --> 01:12:24.839]  We have our own documents admitting it.
[01:12:24.859 --> 01:12:25.320]  Case closed.
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:27.061]  There's too much oil.
[01:12:27.322 --> 01:12:28.002]  We're bathing in it.
[01:12:28.042 --> 01:12:28.623]  It's all a scam.
[01:12:29.508 --> 01:12:34.991]  Yeah, and he said that he lived with this elite group of people for three years.
[01:12:35.271 --> 01:12:42.695]  Well, he was the, let's admit it, for Atlantic Richfield, he was the main chaplain.
[01:12:43.936 --> 01:12:44.196]  Right.
[01:12:44.356 --> 01:12:45.937]  He was a missionary up there.
[01:12:46.517 --> 01:12:49.939]  I was wondering, is there any way that you could possibly get him on your show?
[01:12:49.959 --> 01:12:51.019]  Interviewed him probably 30 times.
[01:12:51.119 --> 01:12:52.420]  Oh, okay.
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:52.900]  Yeah.
[01:12:53.441 --> 01:12:54.101]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:12:54.141 --> 01:12:54.681]  Hey, thank you.
[01:12:54.721 --> 01:12:55.762]  Good to hear from you.
[01:12:55.782 --> 01:12:57.943]  But, I mean, as good as Lindsey is and his info is accurate,
[01:12:59.249 --> 01:13:04.932]  If you go dig around, we've written articles about it, how peak oil is a fraud, how global warming is a fraud.
[01:13:05.633 --> 01:13:07.774]  We have our own UN documents where they explain this.
[01:13:07.794 --> 01:13:08.874]  Here's an example.
[01:13:10.055 --> 01:13:13.997]  This is in the Austin American-Statesman, Saturday, March 8th.
[01:13:14.017 --> 01:13:14.797]  This was yesterday.
[01:13:14.817 --> 01:13:19.380]  And it says, area may have to scramble to meet new air standards.
[01:13:21.341 --> 01:13:25.303]  And it says that Austin has a lot lower levels of
[01:13:27.290 --> 01:13:32.631]  The supposed greenhouse gas ozone.
[01:13:32.811 --> 01:13:38.373]  But now the feds are going to raise the standards and put bigger fines on your cars and vehicles and make you buy new cars.
[01:13:38.873 --> 01:13:39.733]  All sounds reasonable.
[01:13:40.333 --> 01:13:43.474]  But it's about taxation and control, just like taxing carbon dioxide is.
[01:13:43.834 --> 01:13:48.275]  Meanwhile, they just took the restrictions off coal-burning plants to burn dirty coal full of mercury.
[01:13:49.635 --> 01:13:53.176]  Mercury levels are off the chart, but they don't test for mercury, they test for
[01:13:54.062 --> 01:13:57.903]  A gas that actually cleans the atmosphere and that all the studies show and all the levels is good for you.
[01:13:58.183 --> 01:14:02.724]  They just claim ozone is deadly and that they've got to have a bunch of taxes on that.
[01:14:03.024 --> 01:14:06.105]  They take innocuous stuff and restrict it and tax you with it.
[01:14:06.385 --> 01:14:08.125]  And then the really toxic waste substances.
[01:14:08.385 --> 01:14:11.626]  I heard a national talk show host today saying the water is clean to drink.
[01:14:12.646 --> 01:14:13.126]  Tap water.
[01:14:13.826 --> 01:14:20.548]  If you go to the EPA's own website and go into the section, just Google EPA allowable toxins.
[01:14:24.051 --> 01:14:33.237]  And you will find their site with thousands of things that are in every major water supply and the allowable levels of mercury, lead, arsenic, MBTE.
[01:14:34.998 --> 01:14:37.199]  Tap water is a toxic stew in most areas.
[01:14:37.259 --> 01:14:38.180]  Is it good in some areas?
[01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:38.460]  Yeah.
[01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:40.461]  But even those then add sodium fluoride.
[01:14:40.922 --> 01:14:42.823]  And I have the EPA's own admissions that that
[01:14:44.497 --> 01:14:53.979]  If you drink tap water from birth until age 10, federal studies done in the last 50 years, a whole bunch, show between 10 and 20 point IQ reduction.
[01:14:55.059 --> 01:15:01.321]  Versus other study groups and long-term studies in cities right next door that don't drink fluoride.
[01:15:03.381 --> 01:15:08.723]  I did a rant on that on the TV show a few weeks ago and people put it on YouTube and it's had like 200,000 views in two days.
[01:15:09.223 --> 01:15:10.423]  It just went up a few days ago.
[01:15:11.859 --> 01:15:14.981]  And people are going, how come he says 20 point IQ reduction?
[01:15:15.001 --> 01:15:15.861]  He just makes that up.
[01:15:16.542 --> 01:15:17.242]  That's the studies.
[01:15:17.402 --> 01:15:18.783]  I mean, that's the feds admitting it.
[01:15:19.264 --> 01:15:20.945]  They don't publicize that though, do they?
[01:15:21.985 --> 01:15:22.286]  Okay?
[01:15:22.986 --> 01:15:26.669]  Alright, look, I'm going to blitz through Mike, Mike, Pat, Russell, and a few others.
[01:15:27.049 --> 01:15:28.230]  I'm going to blitz through some news.
[01:15:28.650 --> 01:15:29.731]  Lou Dobbs is coming up.
[01:15:29.771 --> 01:15:34.354]  Lou Dobbs on the show, coming up here in a little while, going to be joining us.
[01:15:34.935 --> 01:15:36.638]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:37.238 --> 01:15:44.148]  PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com, JonesReport.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, JonesReport.com, TruthNews.us.
[01:15:44.629 --> 01:15:45.591]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:54.073 --> 01:15:54.734]  It's a fact.
[01:15:54.954 --> 01:16:02.419]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[01:16:02.559 --> 01:16:11.425]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[01:16:11.705 --> 01:16:22.232]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:16:22.492 --> 01:16:23.093]  We're good to go.
[01:16:42.312 --> 01:16:42.752]  We're good to go.
[01:16:54.466 --> 01:16:56.148]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:16:56.468 --> 01:16:59.912]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:17:00.072 --> 01:17:02.335]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:17:02.535 --> 01:17:05.298]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:17:05.618 --> 01:17:11.104]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:17:11.405 --> 01:17:15.349]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:17:15.649 --> 01:17:20.591]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.TV is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[01:20:10.123 --> 01:20:10.763]  Welcome.
[01:20:12.324 --> 01:20:13.605]  Welcome to the machine.
[01:20:17.808 --> 01:20:18.829]  All I ask you to do
[01:20:20.547 --> 01:20:23.089]  To get outside the box, to realize you're being manipulated.
[01:20:23.649 --> 01:20:37.660]  The greatest minds of science, psychology, have been covertly drugging you, poisoning you, dumbing you down, destroying our families, integrating us into a one world government, which is only a means to an end.
[01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:41.723]  The extermination of more than 80% of the world's population.
[01:20:42.243 --> 01:20:48.028]  Official UN policy, official US policy, official German, British, Chinese policy.
[01:20:48.908 --> 01:20:49.829]  Welcome my friends,
[01:20:50.572 --> 01:20:51.152]  To the machine.
[01:20:51.172 --> 01:20:55.974]  All right, get ready with that clip.
[01:20:55.994 --> 01:20:57.415]  I want to play this up right here in a few calls.
[01:20:57.475 --> 01:20:58.495]  This is Sky News.
[01:20:58.535 --> 01:20:59.475]  I'm only going to play part of it.
[01:20:59.896 --> 01:21:05.658]  See if you can pick up on what they're saying and doing, how they're trying to manipulate you here in just one moment.
[01:21:06.218 --> 01:21:09.259]  Right now, let's go ahead and talk to Russell in Austin.
[01:21:09.319 --> 01:21:10.260]  Russell, thanks for holding.
[01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:11.160]  You're on the air.
[01:21:12.113 --> 01:21:17.694]  Hey Alex, I'm a vegetarian and I have some self-imposed diet restrictions due to food quality.
[01:21:17.714 --> 01:21:19.435]  I usually buy organic and whatnot.
[01:21:19.455 --> 01:21:22.635]  I heard your guest on Genetically Modified Food a couple weeks ago.
[01:21:22.655 --> 01:21:23.576]  That's pretty alarming.
[01:21:24.396 --> 01:21:28.597]  My parents came to Austin last week and there are big rumors approaching 60.
[01:21:28.757 --> 01:21:32.898]  I'd say they're classified as average Americans.
[01:21:32.918 --> 01:21:37.999]  I played your podcast and my dad's like, you're Bush Limbaugh, the opposite end of the spectrum.
[01:21:38.039 --> 01:21:40.880]  I told him about GMO and my dad's calling it some other acronym.
[01:21:42.159 --> 01:21:49.882]  I don't know if it's cholesterol or something, but then I showed them some videos, and they watched America Free the Fascism on the internet, and I think they started to wake up.
[01:21:49.902 --> 01:21:52.383]  They went home and watched some War on Drugs documentary.
[01:21:52.643 --> 01:21:54.083]  You broke his conditioning, huh?
[01:21:54.103 --> 01:21:55.884]  You broke his imperial programming.
[01:21:56.424 --> 01:22:07.288]  Yeah, and I think, you know, if we just continue to do that, like here in Austin, my band Toast puts out flyers or shows with just different videos on Google, and my thing is, I wanted to tell you to take care of yourself.
[01:22:07.388 --> 01:22:09.029]  I saw you on Public Access last week,
[01:22:09.688 --> 01:22:10.549]  I hear you, brother.
[01:22:10.569 --> 01:22:11.509]  Good to hear from you.
[01:22:11.529 --> 01:22:11.929]  Thank you.
[01:22:12.009 --> 01:22:12.269]  All right.
[01:22:12.289 --> 01:22:14.591]  Now let's talk to Mike in New Braunfels, Texas.
[01:22:14.671 --> 01:22:15.991]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:22:16.011 --> 01:22:16.812]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:22:16.932 --> 01:22:17.052]  Good.
[01:22:17.092 --> 01:22:17.732]  Long-time listener.
[01:22:17.772 --> 01:22:18.273]  First-time caller.
[01:22:18.293 --> 01:22:18.593]  Welcome.
[01:22:39.676 --> 01:22:49.101]  The Endgame, there in September, a great film, and I put a name on what I've noticed throughout society and with the social engineering and whatnot.
[01:22:49.762 --> 01:22:52.143]  I agree with the last caller.
[01:22:53.544 --> 01:22:55.505]  I show your documentaries to everyone.
[01:22:56.425 --> 01:23:02.709]  I got picked up Rousseau's Freedom to Fascism, and man, it really angers people when they watch it.
[01:23:02.749 --> 01:23:06.491]  I'm doing what I can, but if anything, just to invoke thought in people.
[01:23:06.531 --> 01:23:07.792]  It's like a lost art, you know?
[01:23:08.445 --> 01:23:09.386]  Start questioning.
[01:23:09.446 --> 01:23:11.507]  Start, just question reality.
[01:23:12.207 --> 01:23:19.351]  People's lives, I mean, you know, what I've noticed is, you know, the gut are so busy with work and, you know, the few hours you have with your children.
[01:23:19.371 --> 01:23:21.393]  And chasing after baubles that don't matter.
[01:23:21.433 --> 01:23:26.255]  Well, you know, I only have, you know, time to work and maybe an hour or so at night to rage against the machine.
[01:23:26.335 --> 01:23:28.016]  You have a unique opportunity.
[01:23:28.036 --> 01:23:35.241]  You know, the Creator allowed you to, you know, find an avenue to make a living doing this and, you know, you're kind of the voice for everyone.
[01:23:35.261 --> 01:23:37.462]  Well, it's not a living, it's a mission.
[01:23:38.246 --> 01:23:41.368]  Well, that's your job.
[01:23:41.448 --> 01:23:43.309]  You get the rage all day, it's great.
[01:23:43.989 --> 01:23:46.970]  So just keep it up and I just wanted to tell you thanks.
[01:23:47.191 --> 01:23:47.831]  Thank you, sir.
[01:23:47.891 --> 01:23:48.631]  Very nice call.
[01:23:49.192 --> 01:23:52.513]  Alrighty, let's go ahead now and talk to Pat in New York.
[01:23:52.973 --> 01:23:53.914]  Pat, you're on the air.
[01:23:55.034 --> 01:23:56.895]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:23:57.436 --> 01:24:06.040]  I just have a couple of questions and I know you'd be the right person to ask, but lately I see on the news, well actually it's been going on for a little bit of time now,
[01:24:06.650 --> 01:24:26.995]  As an event happens with any situation, whether it's a school shooting or anything, and all you see for hours upon hours afterwards is these police officers with AR-15s and machine guns holding them up and walking around, and I was just wondering, what would the necessity be?
[01:24:27.235 --> 01:24:29.256]  Just so you know, I'm not against
[01:24:29.853 --> 01:24:37.516]  The police officers having the proper equipment and all of that to use, but what's the idea of walking around with a machine gun hours after an event?
[01:24:37.536 --> 01:24:38.056]  No, no, no.
[01:24:38.096 --> 01:24:38.516]  I hear you.
[01:24:38.556 --> 01:24:41.738]  They tell the police that it's a show of force to make us feel good.
[01:24:41.778 --> 01:24:44.559]  They tell them in case the terrorist or whoever pops up.
[01:24:45.279 --> 01:24:46.580]  But it's all part of a hysteria.
[01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:47.800]  All these drills they have.
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:52.362]  We have government documents where they admit all the terror drills they have is to condition us that terror is real.
[01:24:52.742 --> 01:24:53.642]  We've got to give up our rights.
[01:24:53.682 --> 01:24:54.963]  Meanwhile, the border is wide open.
[01:24:55.823 --> 01:24:56.483]  Here's an example.
[01:24:56.503 --> 01:24:57.624]  I'm going to do this right now.
[01:24:58.709 --> 01:25:00.009]  They're demonizing the Internet.
[01:25:00.029 --> 01:25:02.610]  They're saying, we've got to shut it down, we've got to restrict it, we've got to control it.
[01:25:02.630 --> 01:25:05.831]  I'm going to do some shows in the future about how they do plan to kill the web.
[01:25:06.172 --> 01:25:11.473]  The governments of the world have openly said how they're going to convert it into something where you don't really have free speech and it's controlled.
[01:25:12.254 --> 01:25:12.934]  And it's called Internet 2.
[01:25:12.974 --> 01:25:14.234]  You want to look into it.
[01:25:15.035 --> 01:25:18.056]  But they're demonizing it, saying something must be done, something must be done.
[01:25:18.276 --> 01:25:21.677]  And take this Sky Television news piece out of England.
[01:25:22.777 --> 01:25:27.439]  They show people knocking a woman off of a bike in England, dragging her into a house,
[01:25:28.087 --> 01:25:28.708]  raping her.
[01:25:29.728 --> 01:25:32.851]  And nowhere in the newscast, we don't have time to play the whole thing, but you can go watch it.
[01:25:32.871 --> 01:25:35.292]  We've got a link to it up on InfoWars.com right now.
[01:25:35.893 --> 01:25:40.837]  Do they ever talk about, well, these people raped her, and then they put it on YouTube.
[01:25:40.877 --> 01:25:42.278]  You have the account of who did it.
[01:25:42.738 --> 01:25:43.639]  Go arrest them.
[01:25:44.619 --> 01:25:47.221]  There's no discussion about who gets the blame for this.
[01:25:47.622 --> 01:25:49.423]  Hey, we get to then go bust them.
[01:25:50.524 --> 01:25:54.687]  Or, why haven't they been punished?
[01:25:55.416 --> 01:25:58.338]  It's all about how the Internet's bad and how YouTube's bad.
[01:25:58.879 --> 01:26:06.344]  Well, YouTube's bad because the mainstream media is dying and the newspaper circulation is down by 65% and TV viewership is down and people don't believe them.
[01:26:06.624 --> 01:26:13.929]  They just had a big national survey last month saying that the majority of Americans, 70 plus percent, now primarily trust alternative news over mainstream news.
[01:26:15.190 --> 01:26:17.872]  So the horse has already left the gate, you're not getting him back.
[01:26:18.530 --> 01:26:26.393]  But imagine, you can watch the whole newscast, nothing about the person that uploaded this who did this, go arrest them.
[01:26:27.553 --> 01:26:32.074]  It's just about how humiliating the internet is because it isn't censored first.
[01:26:33.595 --> 01:26:34.155]  What does that mean?
[01:26:35.532 --> 01:26:37.352]  As if the internet made them rapers.
[01:26:37.372 --> 01:26:39.013]  It's all about how the internet raped this woman.
[01:26:39.213 --> 01:26:39.993]  How the internet's bad.
[01:26:40.193 --> 01:26:44.094]  They never mention, and in England they will not punish criminals and rapists now.
[01:26:44.274 --> 01:26:45.855]  It's all, I mean, hardly any of them get busted.
[01:26:46.015 --> 01:26:48.755]  So they call for more cops, more surveillance, and the crime goes up and up and up.
[01:26:49.095 --> 01:26:49.696]  Go ahead and roll it.
[01:26:50.976 --> 01:27:03.159]  The amount of low-level violence and illegal activity being posted online is on the posted online party because of footage like this that the government's now looking into ways to protect people from the effects of such material.
[01:27:04.025 --> 01:27:05.086]  I definitely couldn't believe it.
[01:27:23.502 --> 01:27:30.047]  How could anyone allow anything to be as degrading as that be posted on the internet for millions of people to see?
[01:27:30.467 --> 01:27:36.411]  And not even that, it wasn't even a sexual site, it's a normal site, what young kids look at, anyone looks at.
[01:27:37.372 --> 01:27:38.292]  It's just awful.
[01:27:38.873 --> 01:27:41.654]  Like, how could YouTube allow that to go on there?
[01:27:42.135 --> 01:27:45.237]  I've seen the three-minute footage and it's stomach-churning.
[01:27:45.697 --> 01:27:49.020]  Tanya appears to be totally unconscious as the group abuse her.
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:52.542]  They also filmed themselves laughing into the camera.
[01:27:53.103 --> 01:27:56.244]  All the while her children can be heard crying in the background.
[01:27:56.984 --> 01:28:03.727]  YouTube removed the video as soon as it was brought to their attention, but by that time, 600 people had watched it and done nothing.
[01:28:03.747 --> 01:28:04.367]  Ah, that's enough.
[01:28:04.387 --> 01:28:10.329]  I can't believe that no one... So I can't believe that no one's did, that they're not shutting YouTube down.
[01:28:11.189 --> 01:28:12.930]  Why aren't you saying you can't believe?
[01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:15.631]  And you know they would have busted them, they would have been on the newscast.
[01:28:16.071 --> 01:28:20.632]  They knock her off a bicycle, drag her in a house and gang rape her, in her own house, right out front of her house.
[01:28:20.652 --> 01:28:22.633]  Meaning they've been watching her for a while.
[01:28:24.762 --> 01:28:27.084]  And, oh, because it's precious immigrants to England.
[01:28:27.104 --> 01:28:28.025]  You can't talk about that about them.
[01:28:28.485 --> 01:28:35.871]  And so, why aren't they using the fact that they can trace the IP address of who uploaded that?
[01:28:36.132 --> 01:28:37.193]  We have their faces.
[01:28:38.213 --> 01:28:39.495]  They can bust them now.
[01:28:39.655 --> 01:28:40.976]  Oh, no, that's not going to happen.
[01:28:41.336 --> 01:28:45.099]  It's going to be, YouTube raped me, is basically how this ends.
[01:28:45.199 --> 01:28:46.921]  And you watch the news now, every show.
[01:28:47.381 --> 01:28:49.263]  The internet, evil predators are everywhere.
[01:28:49.303 --> 01:28:51.945]  But you look at a big federal statistics came out just last month.
[01:28:52.657 --> 01:29:00.400]  Showing that about 7% of sexual crimes are connected to the Internet.
[01:29:00.420 --> 01:29:00.400]  7%!
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:01.320]  93% aren't!
[01:29:03.281 --> 01:29:05.882]  It's like most fraud isn't on the Internet with credit cards.
[01:29:06.162 --> 01:29:18.267]  It's when you go in a gas station and the rings of foreigners, that's generally who does it, they then take your credit card, they don't run it, they make copies of it, and they then email or mail it people in India and other places, and then they steal your credit cards.
[01:29:19.082 --> 01:29:20.323]  So see, that's where the real fraud.
[01:29:20.343 --> 01:29:21.224]  They don't tell you that in the news.
[01:29:21.504 --> 01:29:24.407]  It's all the internet, the internet, the internet, the internet, the internet, the internet.
[01:29:24.687 --> 01:29:25.628]  We've got to shut down the internet.
[01:29:25.648 --> 01:29:26.449]  We've got to regulate it.
[01:29:26.609 --> 01:29:27.390]  We've got to censor it.
[01:29:28.111 --> 01:29:30.273]  YouTube got it down after just a little while.
[01:29:30.893 --> 01:29:33.356]  The point is, they're coming after the web big time.
[01:29:33.956 --> 01:29:35.337]  We interviewed Lou Dobbs a few days ago.
[01:29:35.618 --> 01:29:36.639]  We'll play a few clips of that.
[01:29:37.019 --> 01:29:40.542]  Come back, cover some final news, jam in a few calls when we have time in the final segment.
[01:29:40.562 --> 01:29:41.123]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:50.151 --> 01:29:50.452]  Yeah.
[01:29:54.290 --> 01:29:56.832]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:29:57.152 --> 01:29:58.433]  Loose Change, Final Cut.
[01:29:58.713 --> 01:30:00.695]  Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:30:00.875 --> 01:30:02.616]  The True Story of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:30:02.776 --> 01:30:04.017]  The Late Great USA.
[01:30:04.257 --> 01:30:05.658]  America, Freedom to Fascism.
[01:30:06.039 --> 01:30:12.883]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[01:30:21.009 --> 01:30:21.229]  I think so.
[01:30:51.730 --> 01:31:00.036]  Hi neighbor, no matter when the time comes to survive on our food supply, every single one of us who have prepared will have two regrets.
[01:31:00.676 --> 01:31:06.440]  Even those who haven't wasted a single penny on Christmas birthdays and vacations in order to store all the food possible.
[01:31:07.181 --> 01:31:10.403]  Even those who have sold stuff and taken on part-time jobs to buy food.
[01:31:11.084 --> 01:31:14.346]  Even those who have traded their gold while it will still buy food.
[01:31:14.986 --> 01:31:18.269]  Yes, we will have been called stupid, crazy, and foolish.
[01:31:18.940 --> 01:31:23.444]  When folks won't be able to afford food and there won't be any food for any amount of money.
[01:31:24.165 --> 01:31:26.166]  We will still have two regrets.
[01:31:26.807 --> 01:31:30.130]  We will regret that we didn't get more serious about more food sooner.
[01:31:30.830 --> 01:31:33.713]  We will deeply regret that we didn't get enough food.
[01:31:34.493 --> 01:31:41.279]  Putting off emergency food preparations to celebrate the holidays will be the most dangerous decision that some of us will ever make.
[01:31:42.094 --> 01:31:43.536]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com 800-409-5633

[01:32:58.266 --> 01:32:59.707]  We are entering martial law.
[01:33:00.187 --> 01:33:02.349]  There are ten telling signs of martial law.
[01:33:02.869 --> 01:33:04.110]  America has them all.

[01:34:00.530 --> 01:34:02.792]  You're listening to the GCN Radio Network.
[01:34:12.808 --> 01:34:15.690]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're back live now to the second segment.
[01:34:16.710 --> 01:34:18.051]  It is the sixth day of March 2008.
[01:34:19.632 --> 01:34:39.124]  I am extremely honored to be joined by one of my idols, someone I admire as a real journalist and a true patriot, who's been defending the sovereignty of this nation, defending the jobs of every working American, and has stood up in an incredible way to globalism and the corruption of the out-of-control federal government.
[01:34:39.975 --> 01:34:42.636]  He, of course, was born in Texas.
[01:34:42.896 --> 01:34:44.517]  Very proud that he hails from my state.
[01:34:45.578 --> 01:34:46.718]  And he joins us.
[01:34:46.758 --> 01:34:49.860]  His new book is bound to be a bestseller, like all his others.
[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:52.521]  He's the bestselling author of The War on the Middle Class.
[01:34:53.161 --> 01:34:54.602]  And the new book is independent today.
[01:34:54.622 --> 01:34:56.202]  He is Lou Dobbs.
[01:34:57.023 --> 01:34:58.464]  Lou Dobbs, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:34:59.404 --> 01:35:00.224]  Oh, it's great to be with you.
[01:35:00.244 --> 01:35:01.245]  Thank you for the kind words.
[01:35:01.925 --> 01:35:02.765]  You're a busy man.
[01:35:02.806 --> 01:35:08.108]  I hear you're going to start a syndicated radio show on top of your CBS TV show and your number one CNN show.
[01:35:09.433 --> 01:35:17.138]  As a matter of fact, we started Monday and we're off and running a soft launch on a syndicated radio show and I'm having a ball with it.
[01:35:17.759 --> 01:35:19.200]  You didn't tell me how much fun this was.
[01:35:19.900 --> 01:35:24.083]  It is, because you have the free form and you're not kept down in little five-minute segments.
[01:35:24.644 --> 01:35:28.366]  We've only got you for this segment, so I want to move quickly and go through a lot of points.
[01:35:28.646 --> 01:35:29.667]  Tell us about your new book.
[01:35:30.906 --> 01:35:49.009]  Well, Independence Day is a cry for people to start thinking and acting independently, to push back against these political parties, the Republican Party and Democratic Party alike, who've really brought us to the mess that we're in and now are fielding three candidates that say they're the solution.
[01:35:49.491 --> 01:35:50.111]  Well, we certainly do.
[01:36:08.129 --> 01:36:09.471]  I'd like you to be as candid as possible.
[01:36:09.511 --> 01:36:21.645]  You always do that, but, I mean, to really give us the bottom line, both parties bought and paid for by the Fortune 100, who could care less about our sovereignty, who have already basically strip-mined this nation economically.
[01:36:22.046 --> 01:36:27.292]  What do you see coming out of this election with McCain versus Hillary or Obama?
[01:36:28.971 --> 01:36:38.336]  I truly believe, just as you said Alex, that both parties are bought and paid for by corporate America, by socio-ethnocentric interests, special interests.
[01:36:40.277 --> 01:36:48.342]  The first tenet of any democracy is that the rule of the majority prevails, and that the majority will rule in a democracy.
[01:36:49.142 --> 01:36:54.445]  We have a representative republic in which those tenets of democracy were to be preserved.
[01:36:54.955 --> 01:36:59.156]  That is, the majority would be first recognized and ruled.
[01:36:59.897 --> 01:37:09.400]  The majority in this country is simply ignored by the elites of both our political system, academia, and corporate America.
[01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:16.282]  And this race will result in a perpetuation of partisan control and the control of corporate America.
[01:37:16.382 --> 01:37:23.304]  There will be no change, I will guarantee you, if one of the two candidates of these two political parties
[01:37:23.951 --> 01:37:24.712]  He's elected president.
[01:37:24.792 --> 01:37:26.773]  There won't be a change in our fortunes at all.
[01:37:27.493 --> 01:37:32.957]  You joined CNN when it was founded out of the gates as their financial news director.
[01:37:33.037 --> 01:37:33.918]  You've been studying this.
[01:37:33.938 --> 01:37:37.160]  You've run private successful companies yourself.
[01:37:37.420 --> 01:37:43.404]  We see Congress with, depending on the poll, between an 11 and 20 percent approval rating, the lowest it's ever been.
[01:37:43.684 --> 01:37:44.985]  Both parties are reviled.
[01:37:45.005 --> 01:37:46.045]  We've never seen this before.
[01:37:46.406 --> 01:37:49.848]  Looking forward, the establishment is just giving us more of the same.
[01:37:50.308 --> 01:37:55.251]  Kennedy said those that make peaceful revolutions impossible make violent revolutions inevitable.
[01:37:55.631 --> 01:38:06.316]  Looking forward, do you see some type of either economic or even physical revolution or more and more clashes between the disappearing middle class and these elites?
[01:38:07.757 --> 01:38:15.821]  I happen to be one of those, Alex, who believes very strongly that either we will take back our system of government, that is a populist
[01:38:16.707 --> 01:38:23.171]  I don't think it will be a violent revolution, but I think there will be a crisis that will demand action on the part of the people.
[01:38:37.958 --> 01:38:42.342]  The American people right now are not being represented in Washington, D.C.
[01:38:42.383 --> 01:38:45.786]  The will of the majority is not being followed.
[01:38:46.687 --> 01:38:51.732]  Alright folks, that's only about 5 minutes of a 20 minute interview I did with Lou Dobbs live Thursday.
[01:38:51.752 --> 01:38:52.593]  I thought we'd air part of that.
[01:38:53.253 --> 01:38:54.094]  It's up on YouTube.
[01:38:54.114 --> 01:38:58.919]  If you go to PrisonPlanet.com, right there in the corner of the site is the two different YouTube videos of it.
[01:38:59.756 --> 01:39:05.819]  Again, I'll put up some nothing YouTube video and it'll get a million views, and this one's huge, been up for a few days, only had about 50,000 people view it.
[01:39:05.839 --> 01:39:10.121]  I hope you'll go check it out, because we had documents and photos while we interview Lou.
[01:39:10.141 --> 01:39:14.863]  We want this video to go viral, the video of the interview, audio that you were just hearing.
[01:39:15.384 --> 01:39:22.227]  Look, I got calls from Hungary, calls from Oklahoma, Texas, all over the place, and a few final stories I want to jam in, but I've got to go to this call in Hungary.
[01:39:22.247 --> 01:39:24.448]  Are you calling from Eastern Europe?
[01:39:25.928 --> 01:39:26.848]  Hey, hi Alex.
[01:39:26.928 --> 01:39:27.568]  Hi everyone.
[01:39:27.768 --> 01:39:27.968]  Good.
[01:39:27.988 --> 01:39:28.889]  What are you doing over in Hungary?
[01:39:28.909 --> 01:39:29.609]  What time is it there?
[01:39:29.629 --> 01:39:30.129]  Middle of the night?
[01:39:31.889 --> 01:39:34.470]  Uh, yeah, we're, uh, yeah.
[01:39:35.150 --> 01:39:37.590]  Uh, and had a great fight tonight.
[01:39:38.030 --> 01:39:45.752]  Uh, I had a referendum about, well, first, first of all, I'm a first course, and I don't speak that well of English.
[01:39:45.772 --> 01:39:48.112]  That's okay, and you're on an IP phone, too, aren't you?
[01:39:49.992 --> 01:39:51.092]  I'm from Skype.
[01:39:51.193 --> 01:39:52.353]  I'm calling from Skype.
[01:39:52.553 --> 01:39:53.153]  Okay, welcome.
[01:39:54.582 --> 01:39:57.104]  Okay, thanks for the great job you're doing.
[01:39:57.485 --> 01:40:00.127]  Very certain.
[01:40:00.888 --> 01:40:05.712]  Very many people are listening to you here in Hungary.
[01:40:06.833 --> 01:40:09.996]  Let me tell you just a few things and maybe a question.
[01:40:10.016 --> 01:40:11.337]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:40:12.778 --> 01:40:17.623]  We're fighting quite as much as you do here in Hungary.
[01:40:17.703 --> 01:40:18.944]  I know you are, we've got a lot of...
[01:40:20.368 --> 01:40:38.860]  In the EU, because there was just recently a peace treaty adopted, which makes a partnership and a tyranny out of it, and unfortunately the Hungarian parliament has proposed one to rectify this treaty, but we're fighting it.
[01:40:39.041 --> 01:40:41.882]  Yeah, let me be clear, because your Skype is breaking up.
[01:40:41.922 --> 01:40:45.545]  Call me back during the weekday show or next Sunday when you've got a better connection.
[01:40:46.424 --> 01:40:52.729]  In fact, next time if his connection's that bad, let's try to get him to dial back in, because these internet phones can be a little bit sketchy from overseas.
[01:40:52.749 --> 01:40:55.110]  I'm sorry we had to let you go, but you'll hear it on the web.
[01:40:55.150 --> 01:40:56.071]  It didn't sound too good, my friend.
[01:40:56.531 --> 01:40:58.873]  He was talking about how they're forcing Hungary into the European Union.
[01:40:59.033 --> 01:41:00.434]  England has never agreed to join.
[01:41:01.255 --> 01:41:04.517]  And they swore they wouldn't do it, but Gordon Brown, who's openly called for world government.
[01:41:04.557 --> 01:41:06.939]  Just type Gordon Brown, New World Order in all these videos.
[01:41:07.219 --> 01:41:08.500]  We need a world government.
[01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:11.102]  We need to bring in the world New World Order system.
[01:41:11.986 --> 01:41:15.148]  And they wouldn't let the British people vote on a referendum, as they promised.
[01:41:15.168 --> 01:41:19.550]  They just now said, you're under the EU, and you don't have free speech anymore, and we're going to enslave you.
[01:41:20.410 --> 01:41:21.390]  That just happened last week.
[01:41:22.291 --> 01:41:28.634]  There's been a 10-year battle as England tried to stay out of the European Union, and now they've just rammed it through over the top of them.
[01:41:31.895 --> 01:41:32.255]  You know what?
[01:41:32.295 --> 01:41:33.356]  We're just flat out of time.
[01:41:34.817 --> 01:41:40.159]  There are a few other news stories I've got here in front of me, like Britain makes a camera that sees under clothes.
[01:41:41.024 --> 01:41:42.545]  And they've already got these in the airports.
[01:41:42.705 --> 01:41:44.167]  They literally put you on a hard drive.
[01:41:44.227 --> 01:41:45.147]  It's your body naked.
[01:41:45.187 --> 01:41:46.188]  It just looks right through.
[01:41:46.208 --> 01:41:47.329]  It's an image of you.
[01:41:48.110 --> 01:41:48.930]  Total police state.
[01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:51.733]  They're putting cameras in school bathrooms all over Europe and the U.S.
[01:41:52.393 --> 01:41:53.494]  I got another story here.
[01:41:54.435 --> 01:42:00.700]  Insects become fly-on-the-wall spies with tiny cameras, radios, controls, and microphones daily mailed.
[01:42:01.841 --> 01:42:03.042]  Sounds like the stuff of science fiction.
[01:42:03.082 --> 01:42:06.865]  Beetles, rats, sharks turn into cunning spies, courtesy of brain implant or two.
[01:42:07.566 --> 01:42:12.928]  But then it comes in and then it says, but it's true with laboratories around the world hatching a new breed of spy.
[01:42:13.508 --> 01:42:14.969]  Moths, beetles, rats, pigeons.
[01:42:15.049 --> 01:42:20.911]  And they're genetically engineered with the electrodes connected to them with the ports literally growing out of their body.
[01:42:21.411 --> 01:42:23.132]  So this is the type of technology we're facing.
[01:42:23.152 --> 01:42:25.913]  This is the type of stuff the military wants to use against the people.
[01:42:26.213 --> 01:42:28.134]  The elite has just decided to enslave us.
[01:42:28.434 --> 01:42:30.715]  They want all the life extension technologies for themselves.
[01:42:30.975 --> 01:42:32.196]  They test it all on us.
[01:42:32.296 --> 01:42:33.696]  What works, they keep for themselves.
[01:42:33.976 --> 01:42:35.577]  What doesn't work, they leave for the public.
[01:42:36.212 --> 01:42:41.716]  We are in a matrix-like system, and I'm telling you folks, we can't even cover the tip of the iceberg here.
[01:42:41.856 --> 01:42:57.045]  You need to look into it for yourself, and find out how they're poisoning your water, poisoning your air, GMO, genetically engineering your food, adding pesticides to the food, where genetically it develops and grows pesticides themselves.
[01:42:57.446 --> 01:42:59.627]  Pigs and cows won't even eat GMO foods.
[01:42:59.927 --> 01:43:01.208]  But then humans are eating them.
[01:43:01.248 --> 01:43:02.009]  They know it's bad.
[01:43:02.229 --> 01:43:05.631]  Their olfactory nerves, their nose, is literally picking it up.
[01:43:06.522 --> 01:43:17.284]  And something I wanted to spend time on today that I'll probably spend time on on the weekday show tomorrow, I already knew all of this, and I say that not to say you already knew it, but to say that I already know it's all documented and true.
[01:43:17.304 --> 01:43:18.205]  I've already done the research.
[01:43:18.845 --> 01:43:23.406]  And so we're routinely linking now to subpages on the PrisonPlanet.com forum.
[01:43:23.826 --> 01:43:33.668]  We have a big link on the main page today about sterilization, because they've created hundreds of pages of links to mainstream documents, you name it, where they offer PhDs,
[01:43:35.314 --> 01:43:45.322]  At the University of Oregon in sterilization and how sterilized people, where the UN has been caught and admits they add pathogens to tetanus shots and sterilize women.
[01:43:45.642 --> 01:43:49.065]  They've enforced Thai women and others to take it while they're already pregnant.
[01:43:49.525 --> 01:43:53.468]  Eight months, they have abortions, spontaneous miscarriages.
[01:43:54.249 --> 01:43:57.011]  They're doing that to us here, domestically sterilizing us.
[01:43:57.591 --> 01:43:59.753]  This is happening and this is a big deal.
[01:44:00.334 --> 01:44:03.236]  And so I suggest you just go over to theprisonplanet.com forum
[01:44:03.909 --> 01:44:09.032]  And click on this section and just spend a few hours looking at this before you go and trust the medical establishment.
[01:44:09.252 --> 01:44:11.954]  Does that mean your local doctor is evil and trying to sterilize you?
[01:44:12.254 --> 01:44:12.874]  They don't know.
[01:44:12.934 --> 01:44:14.835]  They're good men and women in healthcare.
[01:44:14.976 --> 01:44:18.958]  They're compartmentalized believing that what they're giving you is good, not knowing
[01:44:19.867 --> 01:44:25.852]  That it's the big pharmaceutical companies founded by eugenicists, IBM, founded and run by them, that are doing all this.
[01:44:26.273 --> 01:44:28.775]  We'll see you back live at the next Sunday edition, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:44:28.815 --> 01:44:31.397]  Central, 5 to 7 Eastern, to all the M&M affiliates.
[01:44:31.678 --> 01:44:32.678]  Thank you to all the listeners.
[01:44:32.719 --> 01:44:33.299]  God bless you.
[01:44:33.499 --> 01:44:34.400]  We couldn't do it without you.
[01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:36.041]  And to Trey and Paul, great job.
[01:44:36.262 --> 01:44:36.682]  God bless you.
[01:44:36.702 --> 01:44:38.063]  We'll see you this week and back next Sunday.
[01:44:43.051 --> 01:44:43.732]  The Headlines!
[01:45:12.631 --> 01:45:13.232]  I think so.
[01:45:29.492 --> 01:45:33.219]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[01:45:33.239 --> 01:45:34.741]  Secure your position today.
[01:45:34.761 --> 01:45:36.284]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:45:36.324 --> 01:45:36.564]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
