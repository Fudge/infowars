[00:00:01.291 --> 00:00:02.873]  You want answers?
[00:00:02.873 --> 00:00:04.815]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:04.815 --> 00:00:08.640]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.686]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:16.028 --> 00:00:24.851]  Oil continues to explode in prices despite Saudi output increase pledge because it isn't supply.
[00:00:24.851 --> 00:00:26.191]  It isn't supply.
[00:00:26.191 --> 00:00:38.876]  If you read the actual OPEC report, it is dollar devaluation and speculation in commodities because the global currency is dying to make way for the New World Order.
[00:00:38.876 --> 00:00:39.896]  Unbelievable.
[00:00:39.896 --> 00:00:42.777]  Oil rises despite Saudi output pledge.
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.523]  The Supreme Court is set to announce in the next few hours a vicious attack on the Second Amendment.
[00:00:49.523 --> 00:00:55.046]  It will be announced as a victory for the Second Amendment, but will say they can restrict it by law.
[00:00:55.046 --> 00:00:58.227]  We've got Larry Pratt and Aaron Zellman coming on tomorrow to analyze this.
[00:00:58.227 --> 00:01:01.469]  We're waiting for that ruling, but we already know what it's going to be.
[00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.270]  And so that's coming up.
[00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.552]  We're about to have Jordan Maxwell on in the next segment.
[00:01:06.552 --> 00:01:08.312]  Right now, going back to Ted Anderson.
[00:01:08.312 --> 00:01:11.094]  Ted, this just now came out.
[00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:14.351]  Uh, in Associated Press.
[00:01:14.351 --> 00:01:16.212]  Right now, up on InfoWars.com.
[00:01:16.212 --> 00:01:18.893]  It's also up on Drudge and Yahoo News.
[00:01:18.893 --> 00:01:23.276]  Oil rises on modest Saudi increase, Nigeria.
[00:01:23.276 --> 00:01:27.279]  Oil prices have risen amid disappointment with Saudi's output hike.
[00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:33.122]  And it goes on, and they give you the disinfo saying it's Nigerian pipeline problems.
[00:01:33.122 --> 00:01:34.302]  It's dollar.
[00:01:34.302 --> 00:01:41.726]  I watched yesterday the Saudi oil emergency meeting, and they kept saying, it's currency, it's currency.
[00:01:41.726 --> 00:01:51.111]  But you'll never get on our news, because they can't tell the people the truth, because this is being done by design, and the public would get mad if they found out their criminal government did this, Ted.
[00:01:51.531 --> 00:01:52.892]  Certainly get away from the U.S.
[00:01:52.892 --> 00:01:54.352]  dollar, that's for sure.
[00:01:54.352 --> 00:01:56.773]  And that's what people should be doing at this time.
[00:01:56.773 --> 00:01:57.874]  When I talk about the U.S.
[00:01:57.874 --> 00:02:03.776]  dollar, I'm not talking about our constitutional currency that we should have here in the United States of America.
[00:02:03.776 --> 00:02:04.897]  The private Federal Reserve.
[00:02:04.897 --> 00:02:06.597]  Yeah, there's a private Federal Reserve.
[00:02:06.597 --> 00:02:10.639]  It has nothing to do with the United States government or representation of U.S.
[00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:11.579]  citizens.
[00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:13.620]  It has only to do with private bank economies.
[00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.482]  And we always told people it was dangerous to give them this power, and they're engineering a mass raping.
[00:02:18.482 --> 00:02:20.503]  Ted, give them the gold and silver offer of the day.
[00:02:20.723 --> 00:02:24.025]  Again, right now, I've got Walking Liberty Rolls.
[00:02:24.025 --> 00:02:26.706]  If you pick them up right now, they're at $182.
[00:02:26.706 --> 00:02:31.988]  If you look at it, if you buy them by the coin, it's $188 per roll, but you get a discount on that.
[00:02:31.988 --> 00:02:34.290]  I also have the British Sovereign coin.
[00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.911]  It's a great coin to get into a small piece of gold.
[00:02:36.911 --> 00:02:40.132]  They're at $243 per coin.
[00:02:40.132 --> 00:02:45.215]  You really do need to get into small gold, and you need to have small fractions of silver.
[00:02:45.795 --> 00:02:50.398]  And right now I also have the Frank coin, which we've talked a lot about too, Alex.
[00:02:50.398 --> 00:03:00.445]  And they're right now at $194, and we were talking about those back around January, and they're sitting at about $215 at that time.
[00:03:00.445 --> 00:03:05.588]  And the reason why the prices are low right now is just basically a seasonal thing.
[00:03:06.048 --> 00:03:09.452]  It's not low, it's up at 900 compared to what it was a year ago.
[00:03:09.452 --> 00:03:16.138]  Now, folks, it will go up in, I mean, every time it has, in the fall, and they're talking about $5,000 an ounce.
[00:03:16.138 --> 00:03:17.960]  It's at 900 an ounce right now.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:18.060]  800-686-2237.
[00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.821]  Give them a gold coin, Ted.
[00:03:23.345 --> 00:03:31.508]  Yeah, right now the gold coin is, the best one is the franc right now at 194, and you can call us at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:03:31.508 --> 00:03:33.649]  Pick up your quantities of gold and silver now.
[00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:34.829]  Look at your portfolios.
[00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:35.950]  What do you have in stocks?
[00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.330]  What do you have in the bank?
[00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.811]  What do you have in the bond market?
[00:03:38.811 --> 00:03:40.831]  Where, you know, where are you sitting in real estate?
[00:03:40.831 --> 00:03:50.855]  At this time you should be taking a very serious look, because the United States dollar is doomed, because the foreigners want to get away from it, and they're the ones who supported it when we were going through.
[00:03:51.135 --> 00:03:53.037]  Do the right thing, do the smart thing.
[00:03:53.037 --> 00:03:57.122]  I know you're going to buy gold from Ted and silver from Ted when it's exploding.
[00:03:57.122 --> 00:03:58.865]  It's sitting there right now.
[00:03:58.865 --> 00:04:02.329]  They're saying in the fall it's going to start racing towards $2,000.
[00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:08.156]  I don't know what's going to happen, but I know the dollar's being devalued and that means gold's going to go up in the laws of finance.
[00:04:08.376 --> 00:04:08.576]  I think
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.581]  Buy one or two coins.
[00:04:27.581 --> 00:04:28.681]  Test it out.
[00:04:28.681 --> 00:04:30.021]  Buy a roll of silver dollars.
[00:04:30.021 --> 00:04:30.762]  They're great.
[00:04:30.762 --> 00:04:32.402]  They're hard to get right now.
[00:04:32.402 --> 00:04:34.423]  800-686-2237.
[00:04:34.423 --> 00:04:36.624]  The brokers are there right now.
[00:04:36.624 --> 00:04:39.565]  Tell them it's an Alex Jones special or it's going to cost more.
[00:04:39.565 --> 00:04:41.286]  Those are literally at cost.
[00:04:41.286 --> 00:04:42.826]  800-686-2237.
[00:04:42.826 --> 00:04:44.887]  Ted, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:04:44.887 --> 00:04:46.488]  Hey, thanks for having me up again, Alex.
[00:04:46.488 --> 00:04:47.808]  Bloomberg says $5,000 an ounce gold.
[00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:54.090]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.531]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:04:56.531 --> 00:04:58.833]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:04:58.833 --> 00:05:00.374]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:05:00.374 --> 00:05:02.094]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:05:02.094 --> 00:05:04.956]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:05:04.956 --> 00:05:09.618]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the bilateral commission, the CFR, and you?
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.343]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:05:17.343 --> 00:05:19.584]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:05:39.435 --> 00:05:43.798]  In 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[00:05:43.798 --> 00:05:46.640]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.

[00:05:51.824 --> 00:06:00.170]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on Earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:06.492]  At HempUSA.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the US and Canada.

[00:06:16.996 --> 00:06:19.237]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[00:07:06.273 --> 00:07:08.414]  Well, maybe you don't believe.
[00:07:08.414 --> 00:07:09.754]  Maybe you doubt.
[00:07:09.754 --> 00:07:13.795]  For those who don't believe, we will give you a money-back guarantee.

[00:07:16.376 --> 00:07:17.637]  Some restrictions apply.
[00:07:17.637 --> 00:07:21.418]  That's right, if you don't feel better and lose weight, you can get your money back.
[00:07:21.798 --> 00:07:23.319]  So what are you waiting for?

[00:07:43.168 --> 00:07:44.488]  Read up on us.
[00:07:44.488 --> 00:07:47.249]  You have nothing to lose, but wait.
[00:07:53.297 --> 00:07:59.944]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:07:59.944 --> 00:08:03.428]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:03.428 --> 00:08:07.352]  We're going to be talking to an individual who for more than 50 years
[00:08:09.778 --> 00:08:12.579]  It's coming up on 50 Plus.
[00:08:12.579 --> 00:08:14.239]  We've been fighting the New World Order.
[00:08:14.239 --> 00:08:29.504]  We've been having icons on the show, like G. Edward Griffin and many others, but I really can't think of anybody when it comes to really delving deeply into the New World Order and exposing so many dark secrets that we now just take as commonplace knowledge.
[00:08:29.504 --> 00:08:36.426]  So much of it was pioneered and rediscovered because it was all there in the ancient documents and text by Jordan Maxwell.
[00:08:36.426 --> 00:08:38.026]  So we'll be talking to him in just one moment.
[00:08:38.792 --> 00:08:47.595]  Before we go to Jordan, uh, you can pre-order my new film, 9-11 Chronicles, Truth Rising, Part 1, Truth Rising.
[00:08:47.595 --> 00:08:50.676]  And the way the world's going, who knows, there'll be a part 2.
[00:08:50.676 --> 00:09:05.180]  Uh, but it's got Willie Nelson in it, it's got Governor Jesse Ventura, it's got video interview with George Carlin, who died last night, of course, in Southern California, of heart failure, uh, talking about how the government wouldn't have an investigation in 9-11, they wouldn't investigate something they did.
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.141]  They wouldn't investigate, uh, themselves.
[00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:10.932]  I mean, it's got everybody.
[00:09:10.932 --> 00:09:19.980]  Martin Sheen, it's got the head of democracy now saying 9-11 should be investigated, Building 7 should be investigated.
[00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:24.523]  Michael Moore saying it could be an inside job and that firefighters have told him there were bombs in the buildings.
[00:09:26.531 --> 00:09:38.900]  We've got to expand the description that's up on the InfoWars.com shopping cart because it mainly gets into how we confront Schwarzenegger and how we confront Lynne Cheney and how just all these people get confronted, hundreds of people.
[00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:43.184]  Barack Obama, I mean, the list goes on and on.
[00:09:43.184 --> 00:09:47.567]  Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and of course John McCain.
[00:09:48.843 --> 00:09:51.784]  With We Are Change and 9-11 Truth and everybody.
[00:09:51.784 --> 00:09:56.105]  The video of, of course, We Are Change L.A.
[00:09:56.105 --> 00:10:01.547]  basically taking over Bill Maher's show.
[00:10:01.547 --> 00:10:15.472]  So, it's a story of people standing up, taking action, having a great effect, confronting Bill Clinton, Hillary, Bill Clinton blowing up, admitting Bohemian Grove, admitting Bilderberg, meltdowns, the media saying, kill us, arrest us.
[00:10:17.609 --> 00:10:22.852]  Woven through this is the firefighters, police and military and EMTs dying of the dust.
[00:10:22.852 --> 00:10:28.475]  The government documents where they knew it was going to kill them and decided not to give them health care.
[00:10:28.475 --> 00:10:33.257]  All of that is in the film.
[00:10:33.257 --> 00:10:37.779]  And it just completely devastates their official story.
[00:10:37.779 --> 00:10:40.241]  Truth Rising will ship July 5th.
[00:10:40.241 --> 00:10:42.822]  So, the official release date is July 4th.
[00:10:42.822 --> 00:10:46.284]  It will be on PrisonPlanet.tv midnight.
[00:10:47.094 --> 00:11:06.634]  Uh, the day July 4th starts, so as July 3rd ends, that Thursday, on that Friday morning, throughout Friday, it will be posted in a bunch of different formats, DivX formats, you can burn it to disk, get it out to people in higher quality, Flash, a bunch of other systems, super high quality, for PrisonPlanet.tv members, get it out to people, folks.
[00:11:07.414 --> 00:11:09.134]  And yes, you can order the DVD now.
[00:11:09.134 --> 00:11:11.995]  The DVD is being mass replicated right now.
[00:11:11.995 --> 00:11:24.598]  I'm supposed to get them middle of next week, and so we will have them before it even ships, and then we'll be packaging them up later next week, and they will all ship out on that Saturday and then that next Monday after July 4th.
[00:11:24.598 --> 00:11:29.859]  So get your 9-11 Chronicles Truth Rising today at InfoWars.com.
[00:11:29.859 --> 00:11:30.119]  Okay.
[00:11:33.425 --> 00:11:37.446]  I'm really excited about having Jordan Maxwell on the show.
[00:11:37.446 --> 00:11:44.568]  I kind of woke up to the New World Order on my own, or kind of on the John Birch Society route.
[00:11:44.568 --> 00:11:58.211]  I wasn't part of the John Birch Society, but read stuff like None Dare Call a Conspiracy, The Private Fellow Deserved, and then I learned about Ron Paul fifteen years ago and got a radio show and was kind of a mainline conservative Republican who was anti-New World Order.
[00:11:58.211 --> 00:12:00.251]  Then I found out that that party was controlled.
[00:12:00.251 --> 00:12:02.112]  I mean, even as late as nineteen
[00:12:04.247 --> 00:12:05.388]  Ninety-eight.
[00:12:05.388 --> 00:12:06.929]  Ninety-nine.
[00:12:06.929 --> 00:12:08.710]  I wouldn't get into the occult on air.
[00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:09.791]  I wouldn't talk about it.
[00:12:09.791 --> 00:12:10.511]  I didn't believe it.
[00:12:10.511 --> 00:12:12.332]  I thought, hey, the Federal Reserve is private.
[00:12:12.332 --> 00:12:15.734]  They do want a world government for their administrative convenience.
[00:12:15.734 --> 00:12:21.558]  It is bad, but there's no occult and, you know, that's a bunch of... there's dumb conspiracy theorists.
[00:12:21.558 --> 00:12:22.939]  There's no black helicopters.
[00:12:22.939 --> 00:12:24.760]  There's no FEMA camp plans.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:26.321]  And then Delta Force invaded Texas.
[00:12:26.321 --> 00:12:27.722]  They bribed police chiefs.
[00:12:27.722 --> 00:12:28.402]  I interviewed them.
[00:12:28.402 --> 00:12:33.025]  I found out they had martial law plans with the San Antonio police chief and the emergency managers and I...
[00:12:33.505 --> 00:12:42.314]  And then I found out about Bohemian Grove, and I found out it was real, and I infiltrated it, and so, so really, you know, I am a Johnny-come-lately.
[00:12:42.314 --> 00:12:45.156]  Doesn't matter, we're all Johnny-come-latelys.
[00:12:45.156 --> 00:12:50.561]  You know, in this short life we have, the point is we can all move forward, take action.
[00:12:50.561 --> 00:12:55.386]  And then I remember Chris Athanas, in about 98, 99, putting Jordan Maxwell videos on.
[00:12:56.601 --> 00:12:56.701]  Well,
[00:13:16.016 --> 00:13:19.197]  An independent scholar in the field of occult religious philosophy.
[00:13:19.197 --> 00:13:22.159]  His interest in these subjects began far back as 59.
[00:13:22.159 --> 00:13:30.602]  He served for three and a half years as the regional editor of Truth Seeker Magazine, America's oldest free thought journal since 1873.
[00:13:30.602 --> 00:13:37.505]  His work exploring the hidden foundations of Western religions and secret societies creates enthusiastic responses from audiences around the world.
[00:13:38.306 --> 00:13:58.082]  He has conducted dozens of intense seminars, hosted his own radio talk show, guested on more than 600 radio shows, and written, produced, and appeared in numerous television shows and documentaries, including the two-hour special for CBS TV Network, as well as the internationally acclaimed five-part Ancient Mysteries series, all devoted to understanding ancient religions and their pervasive influence on world affairs today.
[00:13:58.602 --> 00:14:15.526]  His works on the subject of secret societies, both ancient and modern, and their symbols has fascinated audiences around the world for decades, considering the rapidly moving events of today and the very real part these hidden religious agendas play in our modern war-torn world.
[00:14:15.526 --> 00:14:20.227]  He feels that controversial subjects are not only interesting to explore, but too important to ignore.
[00:14:20.227 --> 00:14:24.268]  His extraordinary presentations include documents and photographs seldom seen elsewhere.
[00:14:24.769 --> 00:14:30.324]  Now, we can argue about our interpretation of what Jordan says, but I agree with the info he brings out.
[00:14:30.324 --> 00:14:32.149]  I may even disagree with some of his interpretations.
[00:14:33.258 --> 00:14:33.698]  We're good to go!
[00:15:03.598 --> 00:15:08.460]  We may even hold him over a little bit into overdrive today, but I wanted to properly introduce him.
[00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:11.641]  Jordan doesn't like to talk about himself, but he does have cancer.
[00:15:11.641 --> 00:15:13.962]  He is not doing well financially.
[00:15:13.962 --> 00:15:15.603]  I've heard him on a lot of shows over the years.
[00:15:15.603 --> 00:15:18.264]  He never seems to plug his great books and videos.
[00:15:18.264 --> 00:15:20.125]  Go to his website, JordanMaxwell.com.
[00:15:21.263 --> 00:15:22.364]  Well, thank you Alex for having me on.
[00:15:44.918 --> 00:15:53.222]  Yeah, I just can't tell you how much I appreciate your support and the things you've said, and I thank you for it.
[00:15:53.222 --> 00:16:03.547]  And yeah, it's true that I was interested in these subjects as far back as when I was a teenager, and even earlier.
[00:16:03.547 --> 00:16:08.569]  When I was a kid, I used to ask my parents and ask the adults around me questions, and
[00:16:09.535 --> 00:16:24.542]  Uh, they just will look at me with glassy eyes, and they have no idea in the world what I was talking about, and consequently, I just never understood why people weren't interested in the things that I was, you know?
[00:16:24.542 --> 00:16:38.768]  And so, at 18 years old, I moved to California, and, uh, by myself, ended up in Los Angeles with $9 in my pocket, no family, no friends here, nobody I had no idea in the world
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.462]  You know, what I was going to do with my life, but I ended up in L.A.
[00:16:42.462 --> 00:16:47.024]  with $9 in my pocket in downtown L.A.
[00:16:47.024 --> 00:16:55.908]  Somehow or another, I lived through all of it, but I was fascinated with how much people don't know, and how much people don't care to know.
[00:16:55.908 --> 00:17:05.073]  And I hear people today say, why doesn't the government tell us the truth, and why doesn't these educational institutes really tell us the truth?
[00:17:05.908 --> 00:17:13.655]  I think it's because they, the Illuminati, know that we, generally speaking, don't want the truth.
[00:17:13.655 --> 00:17:15.677]  We don't want to hear the truth.
[00:17:15.677 --> 00:17:23.945]  Now, I've had Jordan Alitas come up to me, I mean, high-level members of government and others, and say, Alex, and they always say, this is off-record, right?
[00:17:23.945 --> 00:17:25.467]  I'm a journalist, so it has to be off-record.
[00:17:26.198 --> 00:17:28.619]  And they say, look, the slaves don't want to know.
[00:17:28.619 --> 00:17:29.879]  You're basically one of us.
[00:17:29.879 --> 00:17:31.260]  You want to be enlightened.
[00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:32.060]  You can't help them.
[00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.940]  You might as well just take care of yourself.
[00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:34.921]  Well, that's what I'm saying.
[00:17:34.921 --> 00:17:39.522]  I mean, I have to, I have to say that that is pretty much true.
[00:17:39.522 --> 00:17:45.864]  And then I also want to ask the question, how important is it to tell the people the real truth?
[00:17:45.864 --> 00:17:49.285]  I mean, like the movie with, uh, you know, when the, when the,
[00:17:49.924 --> 00:17:55.026]  Military guy was asked by the kid, you know, well, what do you want?
[00:17:55.026 --> 00:17:56.406]  He said, I want to know the truth.
[00:17:56.406 --> 00:17:59.607]  And he said, you can't handle the truth.
[00:17:59.607 --> 00:18:03.348]  How important is it to tell people the real truth?
[00:18:03.348 --> 00:18:10.110]  Because what you're doing, and I've learned this the hard way, what you're doing is you're putting your life on the line.
[00:18:10.976 --> 00:18:24.267]  For people who will be entertained for a while hearing you, but they will go on with their regular lives as they always have, watching basketball and doing what they normally do, and life will go on.
[00:18:24.267 --> 00:18:35.417]  Of course, you had the big mouth and was telling people something that they weren't supposed to know, so you end up in trouble, maybe even end up dead or in prison.
[00:18:36.489 --> 00:18:44.078]  The Internal Revenue finds a bad comma on your tax records and now you can go to prison and that way they'll shut you up.
[00:18:45.233 --> 00:18:53.940]  And all because you were trying to help your fellow man who, while you're sitting in prison, they're out at the kids' baseball game because they were just entertained by you.
[00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:57.683]  Jordan, I think what you're saying is people don't need to take this for granted.
[00:18:57.683 --> 00:19:03.887]  They need to appreciate your work, my work, so many others, because it's dangerous and it's valuable.
[00:19:03.887 --> 00:19:05.248]  You've got that right, boy.
[00:19:05.248 --> 00:19:06.549]  That's exactly right.
[00:19:06.549 --> 00:19:09.111]  So the question is, are we casting pearls before swine?
[00:19:09.111 --> 00:19:11.213]  We've got a break, Jordan, a quick break.
[00:19:11.213 --> 00:19:11.853]  We'll come back.
[00:19:11.853 --> 00:19:12.734]  You've got the floor.
[00:19:14.014 --> 00:19:18.196]  But I want to do this interview a little bit different than other interviews, because you don't like talking about yourself.
[00:19:18.196 --> 00:19:24.960]  I want to make you talk about your history, your awakening, because I found talking about people's awakenings tends to wake others up.
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:33.984]  Your journey, and then I want to get into the basics of the New World Order, their greatest secrets, kind of Jordan Maxwell's greatest hits, because
[00:19:35.103 --> 00:19:40.991]  I want to understand your life, your awakening, and then where you see the New World Order going, and we'll take calls.
[00:19:40.991 --> 00:19:42.553]  Jordan Maxwell is our guest.
[00:19:42.553 --> 00:19:43.615]  He isn't feeling well today.
[00:19:43.615 --> 00:19:47.560]  He'll be with us for the next hour and 40 minutes, maybe longer.
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:48.121]  We'll see.
[00:19:48.121 --> 00:19:48.682]  Stay with us.
[00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:52.210]  Good day.
[00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:53.831]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:19:53.831 --> 00:19:54.211]  September 12, 2008.
[00:19:54.211 --> 00:19:54.971]  Gold opened at $756 this morning.
[00:19:54.971 --> 00:19:58.072]  One ounce gold coins can be purchased for $779.28, $389.64 for half ounce, and $194.82 for quarter ounce.
[00:19:58.072 --> 00:19:58.672]  That's $779.28, $389.64, and $194.82.
[00:20:09.375 --> 00:20:21.881]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11,110, was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[00:20:21.881 --> 00:20:25.062]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[00:20:25.062 --> 00:20:28.404]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[00:20:28.404 --> 00:20:31.245]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[00:20:31.505 --> 00:20:34.306]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[00:20:34.306 --> 00:20:35.206]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:35.206 --> 00:20:38.367]  I'd like your liberty.
[00:20:38.367 --> 00:20:39.487]  The paper is free.
[00:20:39.487 --> 00:20:42.388]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:42.388 --> 00:20:46.109]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:46.109 --> 00:20:46.289]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:58.456]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:20:58.456 --> 00:21:01.098]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:21:01.098 --> 00:21:02.659]  But who is the enemy?
[00:21:02.659 --> 00:21:03.440]  Bin Laden.
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.401]  This is his MO.
[00:21:04.401 --> 00:21:05.842]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:21:05.842 --> 00:21:06.903]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:21:06.903 --> 00:21:07.083]  Some U.S.
[00:21:07.083 --> 00:21:11.205]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:21:11.205 --> 00:21:13.646]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:21:25.492 --> 00:21:35.755]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:21:35.755 --> 00:21:36.995]  Fabled enemies.

[00:21:44.737 --> 00:21:48.098]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:21:53.806 --> 00:21:55.968]  We live in a world of vanishing privacy.
[00:21:55.968 --> 00:22:03.816]  The added threat of invisible radio waves sending out personal information to anyone willing to receive them makes our privacy as citizens even less secure.
[00:22:03.816 --> 00:22:07.559]  The RFID tags and ID cards have been proven to be not secure.
[00:22:07.559 --> 00:22:11.743]  Thieves are able to read information stored on these tags to steal your identity.
[00:22:11.743 --> 00:22:17.029]  Protect yourself from ID theft with our RFID blocker available as a wallet or passport case.
[00:22:17.609 --> 00:22:21.272]  ProSpy.com offers simple, affordable personal protection.
[00:22:21.272 --> 00:22:25.556]  Many countries, including the U.S., have begun to institute RFID in passports.
[00:22:25.556 --> 00:22:26.717]  Why take a chance?
[00:22:26.717 --> 00:22:28.759]  This is your personal information.
[00:22:28.759 --> 00:22:29.720]  Protect yourself.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:34.024]  ProSpy.com also offers a complete selection of spy gear and security equipment.
[00:22:34.544 --> 00:22:38.971]  Including bug detectors, camera finders, countermeasure equipment and night vision gear.

[00:22:51.903 --> 00:22:53.904]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:22:53.904 --> 00:23:00.847]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:23:00.847 --> 00:23:09.250]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:14.973]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:23:15.213 --> 00:23:16.995]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:23:16.995 --> 00:23:19.278]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:23:19.278 --> 00:23:23.703]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:23:23.703 --> 00:23:25.946]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:23:25.946 --> 00:23:33.675]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[00:24:08.701 --> 00:24:11.542]  Jordan Maxwell.
[00:24:11.542 --> 00:24:12.963]  Anthony Hilder.
[00:24:12.963 --> 00:24:15.484]  David Ray Griffin.
[00:24:15.484 --> 00:24:21.007]  I guess you could talk about people like Red Beckman, Law That Never Was.
[00:24:21.007 --> 00:24:23.668]  People fighting the New World Order.
[00:24:23.668 --> 00:24:26.930]  Different genres, but all going in the same direction, trying to wake the sheep up.
[00:24:28.281 --> 00:24:29.082]  He's a real icon.
[00:24:29.082 --> 00:24:30.262]  We appreciate having him on.
[00:24:30.262 --> 00:24:32.864]  Just a network note, we're going to continue and skip this break.
[00:24:32.864 --> 00:24:37.266]  For Infowars.com listeners and PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, coming up to our next main break.
[00:24:37.266 --> 00:24:38.847]  We'll be at 50 after.
[00:24:38.847 --> 00:24:47.972]  Jordan Maxwell, let's start off with, you get there with, you know, less than 20 bucks in your pocket in LA when you're 13 years old.
[00:24:47.972 --> 00:24:57.277]  Go through your life, your awakening process, some of the people you ran into over the years, and what that awakening was like.
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:02.703]  Well, yeah, I was 18 when I came to Los Angeles, and I had no idea why.
[00:25:02.703 --> 00:25:04.725]  I just felt I had to go somewhere.
[00:25:04.725 --> 00:25:11.970]  Originally, I'm from the South, I'm from Florida, and I ended up in Los Angeles back in 59.
[00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:21.717]  And I had no idea why I was here or what I was going to do with my life, but I just was drawn to the fact that I wanted to know.
[00:25:22.717 --> 00:25:26.140]  And so many people today just don't want to know.
[00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:28.942]  And so that's what drove me.
[00:25:28.942 --> 00:25:46.756]  And I've done what I have done with nothing for so many years because I have always appreciated the people who made themselves available for me by doing tapes and records and lectures and teachers who I could go to to learn.
[00:25:47.655 --> 00:26:10.596]  The things that I was, my heart was burning to know and I would, I would attend all the lectures I could, read everything I could get my hands on because I wanted to know and I really appreciated those people many years ago that were there out on the front lines like you are today making the information available so that I could learn.
[00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:22.449]  And so that's what I wanted to do with my life at 19 years old, is to gather up as much information as possible and make it available to all that wanted to hear.
[00:26:22.449 --> 00:26:26.272]  And so I was very idealistic about that.
[00:26:26.272 --> 00:26:28.034]  But I discovered something.
[00:26:28.034 --> 00:26:30.235]  I'll tell you a big secret that I discovered.
[00:26:30.235 --> 00:26:32.858]  It took me many years to figure it out.
[00:26:32.858 --> 00:26:38.022]  But people will always support what they want to hear.
[00:26:38.812 --> 00:26:41.714]  They will not support what they don't want to hear.
[00:26:41.714 --> 00:26:45.416]  And if you like country music, you're not going to pay money for an opera.
[00:26:45.416 --> 00:26:50.220]  If you like classical music, you're not going to pay money to go to an acid rock concert.
[00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:53.942]  So people will always support what they want to hear.
[00:26:53.942 --> 00:26:58.225]  And so I always assumed as a young person that people were like me.
[00:26:58.225 --> 00:27:00.366]  They wanted to know the truth.
[00:27:00.366 --> 00:27:08.432]  And so I later on discovered that no, most of the time people do not want to know the truth.
[00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:27.820]  They will look at something, see that it's wrong, and then prefer to, as Churchill said, every now and then you'll stumble on the truth, but then you'll pick yourself up, brush yourself off, and go on, act like you never saw it, and just go on and live your life, and go to the ballgame, and have a good time.
[00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:31.602]  And one day, what comes around goes around.
[00:27:31.602 --> 00:27:36.105]  One day, what you should have looked at, you should have been concerned about,
[00:27:36.886 --> 00:27:46.192]  Well, when it comes to you, finally, and you finally have to see what you, you know, what you could have seen years ago, but you didn't want to.
[00:27:46.192 --> 00:27:53.657]  Well, that's what I wanted to do, is to make this kind of information that I was interested in available to everyone.
[00:27:53.657 --> 00:27:56.339]  And you mentioned John Birch Society.
[00:27:56.339 --> 00:28:03.904]  As far back as 19... I think they were founded in 1959 in Belmont, Massachusetts, where I used to
[00:28:05.209 --> 00:28:14.171]  Send research articles to Belmont back in 1961, 62, and 63 to the Bird Society as they're just getting going.
[00:28:14.171 --> 00:28:24.234]  I was doing a lot of research on my own on fascism, Nazism, communism, all of the different movements of the bankers, etc.
[00:28:24.234 --> 00:28:31.856]  So I was just sending in articles and sometimes I'd see some of my work being incorporated into their literature.
[00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:43.864]  And then I began to connect with all kinds of researchers and writers, and the more I learned, the more I realized how much I don't know.
[00:28:43.864 --> 00:28:59.089]  And I realized, too, that most people don't want to know, and that's what really frightened me, because now we're faced with something that is just absolutely beyond most people's ability to even grasp.
[00:29:00.106 --> 00:29:14.113]  And I have no words for it because I know that this country and this republic cannot be saved as long as there's a flaw in the thinking of the people.
[00:29:14.113 --> 00:29:19.696]  Look at your decisions in life are only as good as your information.
[00:29:19.696 --> 00:29:24.999]  And if you are not willing to look at all of the truth, then you don't have it yet.
[00:29:25.678 --> 00:29:30.162]  And as long as you don't have it all, any attorney will tell you before going in the court.
[00:29:30.162 --> 00:29:34.226]  If you don't have everything going for you, then don't go.
[00:29:34.226 --> 00:29:39.611]  Don't even try, because you're not going to win, because you don't know the facts yet.
[00:29:39.611 --> 00:29:42.154]  So that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:29:42.154 --> 00:29:43.555]  We're on the march.
[00:29:43.555 --> 00:29:46.077]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:46.077 --> 00:29:48.780]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:51.997 --> 00:29:53.938]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:29:53.938 --> 00:29:57.560]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:00.022]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:30:00.022 --> 00:30:03.064]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:30:03.064 --> 00:30:08.787]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:30:08.787 --> 00:30:12.710]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[00:33:11.967 --> 00:33:17.195]  We're going to talk more about his awakening, his process of awakening, that journey.
[00:33:18.906 --> 00:33:35.476]  And then we're going to get into, basically, the biggest secrets he discovered, the bottom line on how it works, and what the Globalist New World Order, Occult Kingdom, Occult Theocracy's master plan is, with Jordan Maxwell.
[00:33:35.476 --> 00:33:38.358]  Today, the website jordanmaxwell.com.
[00:33:38.358 --> 00:33:47.203]  A lot of books, very old books that he owns the copyright to, that really break down how they run and control things are there available at jordanmaxwell.com.

[00:33:57.991 --> 00:34:03.095]  A picture gallery, great website, jordanmaxwell.com.
[00:34:03.095 --> 00:34:08.439]  Uh, you know, I took off last week and went with my family to the Texas beach to spend a few days with them.
[00:34:08.439 --> 00:34:11.982]  And while I was out on the beach, I wrote notes.
[00:34:11.982 --> 00:34:16.125]  About 20 pages of notes of what I thought was most important in life.
[00:34:17.265 --> 00:34:23.971]  And one of the things I wrote in here is that I was really thinking about what makes me up, who I am.
[00:34:23.971 --> 00:34:38.043]  And I thought about being a young man and being ego driven and wanting to be tough and good looking and wanting to get in fights with bullies and you know, kind of those base type things you do when you're young, but that's normal.
[00:34:38.043 --> 00:34:39.805]  It's a hierarchy of needs.
[00:34:39.805 --> 00:34:41.006]  It's a journey we're all on.
[00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:47.574]  And I thought about how I still fall back into ego sometimes, but less and less.
[00:34:47.574 --> 00:34:51.778]  It's almost like a long-lost, uh, forgotten friend.
[00:34:51.778 --> 00:34:54.681]  Because it's a great source of energy, ego, but it also blinds you.
[00:34:55.854 --> 00:34:58.236]  And I remember decades ago, people would tell me about ego.
[00:34:58.236 --> 00:35:06.122]  I couldn't even grasp the concept, even in psychology class, because I was still so controlled by ego when I was 18, 19 years old.
[00:35:06.122 --> 00:35:07.423]  But now I understand what it is.
[00:35:07.423 --> 00:35:10.806]  I'm totally separate from my, quote, mind.
[00:35:10.806 --> 00:35:14.729]  I can pull back, look at myself, warts and all.
[00:35:14.729 --> 00:35:24.137]  I can analyze what makes humans tick, how we operate, the basic engineering, the basic genetics, what our true values are, what we're truly meant to do.
[00:35:24.989 --> 00:35:32.314]  And at the final equation, laying down your life for your neighbor means that you save yourself.
[00:35:32.314 --> 00:35:49.405]  Because when you have that attitude of laying down your life for your neighbor, when you do have courage, when you do care about others, when you're not greedy and filled with hate, when you're not just self-centered, you truly are conscious and can now use your brain, and you understand that in a society where we care about each other, and that means sometimes fighting against evil.
[00:35:49.405 --> 00:35:51.006]  That doesn't mean just laying back and being a wimp.
[00:35:52.165 --> 00:35:54.869]  That you have a better society, a dynamic system.
[00:35:54.869 --> 00:35:55.970]  Does it mean we're ever perfect?
[00:35:55.970 --> 00:36:00.136]  No, but we're reaching towards something better.
[00:36:00.136 --> 00:36:08.808]  And being there, you know, at the beach, laying in the sand, watching my children play and build sandcastles, and seeing God's beautiful creation, you know, the firmament.
[00:36:10.464 --> 00:36:22.953]  You know, just looking at how wonderful this world is and how Madison Avenue has trained us to feel inadequate, to be unhappy, to not see how great things are, but to not also be able to see all the evil that's in the world at the same time.
[00:36:22.953 --> 00:36:26.376]  People are basically blind to the beauty and blind to the ugliness.
[00:36:26.376 --> 00:36:28.738]  They've been stunted and kind of shrunken down.
[00:36:28.738 --> 00:36:30.058]  They're looking at the world through a
[00:36:30.919 --> 00:36:33.101]  Through a straw.
[00:36:33.101 --> 00:36:35.923]  They're seeing such a limited perspective.
[00:36:35.923 --> 00:36:39.905]  And I have a desire to see them have pleasure.
[00:36:39.905 --> 00:36:42.047]  I have a desire to see them be free.
[00:36:42.047 --> 00:36:44.429]  I have a desire to see them do well.
[00:36:44.429 --> 00:36:49.612]  I have a desire, kind of a builder's desire, which is what we're all meant to be, creators.
[00:36:49.612 --> 00:36:51.874]  To see their minds unlocked.
[00:36:51.874 --> 00:36:57.718]  And I have a desire to learn more and to challenge myself and to really know the truth.
[00:36:58.906 --> 00:37:13.001]  And it's painful to realize that a lot of them don't want to do that, and they want to be caught in snares, and they want to be killed, and they want to have fluoride put in their water, and they want to be injected with cancer, and they want to give their kids mercury shots, and they don't want to know the truth.
[00:37:13.001 --> 00:37:19.928]  And I wanted to ask Jordan this question, or make this statement and get his take on it, and I wrote here in a little book
[00:37:21.762 --> 00:37:42.748]  Uh, that, that I realize that the instinct to want to build something better for the tribe is a human instinct, and to, and to realize that the human community is bigger than just yourself, and that I want to pass better things on to people, and that all the good things we have is because other good people before us pass them on to us.
[00:37:43.487 --> 00:37:53.678]  And there's always been this struggle of good and evil within our own species that's being directed and controlled from above, and you can debate what that intelligence is.
[00:37:53.678 --> 00:38:00.386]  And Jordan gets into that, but certainly, for those that have studied, it's there, and the elite know it's there, and communicate with it.
[00:38:01.147 --> 00:38:03.368]  With both sides of it or whatever it is.
[00:38:03.368 --> 00:38:04.869]  God.
[00:38:04.869 --> 00:38:08.631]  But then they control it and put out a false facsimile for the public.
[00:38:08.631 --> 00:38:12.672]  But my only message is that I'm not just some do-gooder.
[00:38:12.672 --> 00:38:14.173]  I want to transmit knowledge.
[00:38:14.173 --> 00:38:16.334]  I want to tell people the mistakes I've made.
[00:38:16.334 --> 00:38:17.595]  I want to let them know.
[00:38:17.595 --> 00:38:19.736]  I want them to see pitfalls.
[00:38:19.736 --> 00:38:20.676]  And I want to write.
[00:38:20.676 --> 00:38:21.817]  I want to make films.
[00:38:21.817 --> 00:38:24.978]  And it's because I want to communicate with the future.
[00:38:24.978 --> 00:38:26.199]  And I can almost feel
[00:38:26.819 --> 00:38:27.440]  Tangibly.
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:31.523]  I do feel it, but is it a facsimile in my mind or is it real?
[00:38:31.523 --> 00:38:52.040]  The bouncing back from the future, the information I've already put out, I can feel the good it's created and I can feel it tangibly coming back at me from the future and I know that I stand on the shoulders of those in the past and I can feel myself with my ancestors and others looking back into the past and into the future.
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:39:03.529]  And if you really want to get down to what makes Alex Jones tick, at the end of the day, when Jordan was just talking, I was going to share this later in the week, it's that I want to make things better for those in the future.
[00:39:03.529 --> 00:39:05.211]  Because I live on through them.
[00:39:05.211 --> 00:39:15.860]  I live on through their pleasure and their pain and their exaltation and the births and the deaths and the lives that were all part of a larger species, like a cell in a larger
[00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:16.720]  Well, Alex,
[00:39:46.623 --> 00:39:51.526]  I'm so happy that you said those things, because that's exactly what I was going to say.
[00:39:51.526 --> 00:39:58.250]  I'm older and more tired than you are, so you said it so much better than I would have said it.
[00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:00.431]  That's exactly what I feel.
[00:40:00.431 --> 00:40:03.412]  Precisely what you said is exactly what I feel.
[00:40:03.412 --> 00:40:04.213]  When I was young,
[00:40:04.853 --> 00:40:19.006]  When I was younger, I was filled with the zeal for knowledge and wisdom and understanding and questioning everything and talking to all the adults that were out there writing and speaking publicly.
[00:40:19.006 --> 00:40:23.450]  I loved knowledge and I loved the idea of helping my fellow man.
[00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:25.072]  I loved watching young people.
[00:40:25.972 --> 00:40:30.795]  Their eyes light up when you show them something they've never seen before.
[00:40:30.795 --> 00:40:33.036]  It's the instinct of a teacher.
[00:40:33.036 --> 00:40:39.539]  And the older I grew, the more I loved talking to audiences and helping them to understand.
[00:40:39.539 --> 00:40:45.262]  Because, you know, like the Apostle Paul says, do you not teach yourself when helping others?
[00:40:45.262 --> 00:40:50.565]  So I was learning and I was trying to transmit all the things I was learning to other people.
[00:40:51.348 --> 00:41:01.384]  Well, when I took my work publicly back in 1988, I decided to go public and instead of the little Mickey Mouse venues that I had been speaking at, the little
[00:41:02.293 --> 00:41:06.077]  Mom and Pop bookstores.
[00:41:06.077 --> 00:41:07.878]  You emerged from the underground.
[00:41:07.878 --> 00:41:08.779]  Yes.
[00:41:08.779 --> 00:41:15.866]  I had been speaking at little venues, small little venues around Los Angeles.
[00:41:15.866 --> 00:41:22.973]  As far back as 1961 and 62, I was giving lectures in libraries in little small groups.
[00:41:23.873 --> 00:41:41.341]  Uh, ladies home groups and all these little, uh, venues on secret societies, Bible codes, Knights Templars, uh, Nazi fascism, all of the different secret societies that were operating and how they were connected behind the scenes in European bloodlines.
[00:41:42.143 --> 00:41:59.071]  All of that back in the 60s, early 60s, but it wasn't until I was introduced to the work of Myron Fagan, Anthony Hilda put out the records set on Illuminati, that was in late 66.
[00:41:59.071 --> 00:42:02.653]  Well, I got a copy of it almost right after they came out.
[00:42:02.653 --> 00:42:04.774]  And all the pieces came together?
[00:42:04.774 --> 00:42:06.114]  All of it came together.
[00:42:06.114 --> 00:42:07.695]  It all began to make sense.
[00:42:08.235 --> 00:42:11.338]  Of the things which I was already interested in.
[00:42:11.338 --> 00:42:17.342]  Let me interrupt briefly and see if you're on the same page or can expand.
[00:42:17.342 --> 00:42:21.205]  This is for people that are listeners of mine and think that I know more, Jordan knows more than you do.
[00:42:21.205 --> 00:42:22.346]  Let me explain something.
[00:42:22.346 --> 00:42:29.832]  When you get so close to a problem and you understand the different sectors of it, you can be called a master of understanding the New World Order.
[00:42:29.832 --> 00:42:32.274]  As Jordan said, you realize how much you don't know.
[00:42:33.652 --> 00:42:59.242]  And so I would imagine you discovered thousands of things that Myron Fagan didn't know, but that was the last piece, or the master key, the Rosetta Stone, that the tumblers flipped, and then you went, because I know your research, to a whole new level past him, but we have to understand that it was that step that brought you to the next level, and then you bring others, and then you learn more from new people, and then we just
[00:43:00.643 --> 00:43:02.944]  That's exactly right.
[00:43:02.944 --> 00:43:10.309]  And so I was then caught on the track of Illuminati as a philosophical concept.
[00:43:11.171 --> 00:43:19.413]  And so I was living in UCLA libraries, USC, Berkeley, I was all over the state.
[00:43:19.413 --> 00:43:26.274]  I personally went to all of those because we didn't have the computers and the technology we have today.
[00:43:26.274 --> 00:43:32.936]  So I personally spent years at UCLA's research library, general research.
[00:43:33.957 --> 00:43:44.106]  Uh, USC, I used to spend days and weeks and months, uh, at USC and the stacks, uh, late at night photocopying documents from old books.
[00:43:45.365 --> 00:43:49.248]  And so, the more I learned, the more I knew how much I didn't know.
[00:43:49.248 --> 00:44:10.784]  And I was fascinated with every day I was learning things, and it was as if the spirit was bringing me people and bringing things to me, because it was as if the spirit in the universe knew that I wanted to know, and that I was eager to learn, and so I was meeting all kinds of interesting people.
[00:44:10.784 --> 00:44:13.406]  And it was just blowing my mind.
[00:44:14.395 --> 00:44:24.258]  And then, like I said, about 1988, I had a nervous breakdown because I lost my wife, I lost my family, I lost everything.
[00:44:24.258 --> 00:44:33.281]  But those things happen in life, but I wasn't ready for it and too much of it came too quickly and it just overwhelmed me and I just broke down.
[00:44:34.016 --> 00:44:37.177]  But when I came out... Did you lose your wife because of the research?
[00:44:37.177 --> 00:44:38.378]  Was she sick of it?
[00:44:38.378 --> 00:44:46.041]  Yes, because she decided that she had had enough of me, and whatever it was that was driving me, she wanted no part of it.
[00:44:46.041 --> 00:44:50.563]  All the time I was living with her, she never wanted to hear anything that I was interested in.
[00:44:50.563 --> 00:44:54.945]  Yeah, Richard Gage's wife, architect and engineer, left him over this stuff.
[00:44:54.945 --> 00:44:55.746]  It's really sad.
[00:44:55.746 --> 00:44:56.666]  I'm blessed to have my wife.
[00:44:57.285 --> 00:45:03.989]  And so, uh, and so I, you know, that was a terrible blow to me because she just decided she's had enough.
[00:45:03.989 --> 00:45:04.389]  That's it.
[00:45:04.389 --> 00:45:12.574]  She doesn't, she doesn't want, she used to tell me all the time, why don't you just get a job and be like everybody else and just go along to get along?
[00:45:12.574 --> 00:45:17.397]  And I said, my God did not bring me into this world to go along to get along.
[00:45:17.397 --> 00:45:19.939]  My God brought me here to be who I am.
[00:45:20.692 --> 00:45:22.294]  And to do what I do.
[00:45:22.294 --> 00:45:29.403]  I have a high respect for the concept of the divine force in the universe that men call God.
[00:45:29.403 --> 00:45:34.149]  I believe that certain people are brought here purposely to do work.
[00:45:35.221 --> 00:45:41.203]  And so I have a very high regard for spiritual things.
[00:45:41.203 --> 00:45:44.063]  But not for the whorehouse churches that are Illuminati-controlled.
[00:45:44.063 --> 00:45:57.226]  Yeah, not for the corporations, silly bull that we call the religions today, jumping around on stages with their diamond rings and their effeminate haircuts and jumping around, falling down.
[00:45:57.226 --> 00:45:59.207]  It's just incredible.
[00:46:00.668 --> 00:46:03.290]  Uh, display of stupidity.
[00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:05.351]  Look at, think about this.
[00:46:05.351 --> 00:46:16.120]  If you were to go to a particular school for 40 years and study one subject for 40 years and one day come out of that 40 years of study and can't even read
[00:46:19.541 --> 00:46:27.165]  Or form a sentence correctly, and cannot hold an intelligent conversation with your fellow man.
[00:46:27.165 --> 00:46:29.486]  What kind of a school is that?
[00:46:29.486 --> 00:46:32.587]  That you've spent all your life in and can't even read?
[00:46:32.587 --> 00:46:41.131]  Well, the same thing is true with so many Christians who have been Christians all their life, and spent all their life pursuing a church.
[00:46:42.973 --> 00:46:56.723]  And have no idea in the world what certain words mean, the etymology of words and terms and symbols, corporate logos, flags, poetry, where concepts have come from.
[00:46:56.723 --> 00:47:00.045]  The obelisk, it's all the complete opposite.
[00:47:00.045 --> 00:47:03.928]  Opposite, totally opposite than what you think it is.
[00:47:03.928 --> 00:47:05.289]  Well, I mean that's the issue.
[00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:16.659]  They have Benny Hinn and all those guys and it's turned out they get government financing to start them off to make it look stupid to actually turn spiritual people off.
[00:47:16.659 --> 00:47:20.864]  And I've noticed, I wanted to get your take on this, that the Illuminati, the globalists are all
[00:47:21.897 --> 00:47:40.445]  Whether it's Ted Turner, Maury Strong, Prince Philip, David Rockefeller, they're all deeply occultic, deeply into this Illuminati religion of killing their fellow humans for the greater good of Gaia, but then they finance all the atheist groups to tell people there's nothing.
[00:47:41.798 --> 00:47:46.281]  So they really want to turn people off from a true spiritual experience, don't they?
[00:47:46.281 --> 00:47:47.462]  That's exactly right.
[00:47:47.462 --> 00:47:53.206]  There is a world of difference between being religious and truly spiritual.
[00:47:53.206 --> 00:47:57.688]  A true spiritual person is exactly what the Bible has Jesus saying.
[00:47:57.688 --> 00:48:01.831]  Go into your inner chambers or go someplace by yourself and pray it.
[00:48:03.402 --> 00:48:06.023]  Pray by yourself to your father.
[00:48:06.023 --> 00:48:13.746]  You don't need to dance around on the stage with diamond rings and make a fool of yourself jumping around.
[00:48:13.746 --> 00:48:18.548]  You know, spirituality is between you and your Creator.
[00:48:18.548 --> 00:48:22.069]  And I've always understood that.
[00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:31.313]  And I'm just amazed at how many people buy into never even asking the questions, where are these people getting the money?
[00:48:32.637 --> 00:48:36.761]  Uh, it's just, uh, I don't have words for it.
[00:48:36.761 --> 00:48:37.701]  TBN.
[00:48:37.701 --> 00:48:39.363]  Typical TBN.
[00:48:39.363 --> 00:48:47.051]  They got statues of, uh, of, uh, pagan gods in their, uh, in their yards.
[00:48:47.051 --> 00:48:49.193]  Bacchus Dionysus.
[00:48:49.193 --> 00:48:55.619]  Uh, one of the, uh, gods that has been used to represent Satan is out there in TBN's courtyard.
[00:48:56.471 --> 00:49:02.647]  The very symbol that the Christianity has used for the devil is sitting in TBN's courtyard.
[00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:13.249]  But, consequently, nobody reads, nobody questions... They also have copies of the Babylonian altar in some of their TV shows with plants sitting on it, right in front of everybody.
[00:49:13.249 --> 00:49:14.751]  The one that was at Ishtar's Gate?
[00:49:14.751 --> 00:49:16.572]  Right in your face, absolutely.
[00:49:16.572 --> 00:49:19.275]  What's the name of that altar that the Bible says is Satan's seat?
[00:49:19.275 --> 00:49:21.877]  And they have copies of it on TV right in front of you.
[00:49:21.877 --> 00:49:27.823]  Yeah, and the trees, the trees all around TBN, as you walk around you'll see these spiral trees.
[00:49:28.403 --> 00:49:33.488]  Those spiral trees all over TPN's lot are called Shiva's phallic.
[00:49:33.488 --> 00:49:41.535]  They symbolize the old Hindu religion, the erect phallic of Shiva, the god Shiva.
[00:49:42.199 --> 00:49:44.540]  And TBN has them everywhere.
[00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:49.281]  Everywhere you go, you see sexual symbols, occult stuff, demonic symbols.
[00:49:49.281 --> 00:49:55.902]  And Crouch admittedly has all his homosexual mistresses, but then he speaks out against gay people on his show.
[00:49:55.902 --> 00:49:56.343]  I know.
[00:49:56.343 --> 00:49:58.623]  And then publicly has all his male mistresses.
[00:49:58.623 --> 00:50:02.084]  And look, I used to be, my friend died, but
[00:50:03.274 --> 00:50:11.736]  A very bright guy who was just an interesting man, lived down in Balboa Island.
[00:50:11.736 --> 00:50:15.557]  I used to go down to see him, and he worked at a liquor store.
[00:50:15.557 --> 00:50:22.039]  He was very wealthy, but just to have something to do, he worked at a liquor store on Balboa Island.
[00:50:22.039 --> 00:50:27.661]  And he used to tell me, I'd go down and sit on the wharf and talk with him about theology and religion.
[00:50:27.661 --> 00:50:28.761]  Very, very bright guy.
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:38.964]  And he was telling me, you know, in my liquor store, uh, all the officials from TBN come and buy their booze and they buy them by cases.
[00:50:38.964 --> 00:50:50.969]  Uh, Paul and Jan Crouch come down and buy thousands of dollars in booze and whiskey and all kinds and throw their big parties and I was just thinking to myself, you know, the people are so stupid.
[00:50:52.199 --> 00:50:58.948]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:50:58.948 --> 00:51:01.612]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:51:01.612 --> 00:51:03.134]  But who is the enemy?
[00:51:03.134 --> 00:51:03.955]  Bin Laden.
[00:51:03.955 --> 00:51:04.816]  This is his MO.
[00:51:04.816 --> 00:51:06.338]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:51:06.338 --> 00:51:07.480]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:07.760]  Some U.S.
[00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:11.181]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:51:11.181 --> 00:51:12.962]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:51:25.987 --> 00:51:36.255]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:51:36.255 --> 00:51:37.476]  Fabled enemies.

[00:51:52.065 --> 00:51:53.826]  Honey, have you seen the remote?
[00:51:53.826 --> 00:51:56.047]  Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?
[00:51:56.047 --> 00:51:57.807]  I can't find my wallet!
[00:51:57.807 --> 00:51:58.648]  Sound familiar?
[00:51:58.648 --> 00:52:02.109]  Why not save time looking for lost things and lose the stress instead?

[00:52:52.153 --> 00:52:56.356]  Do you have doubts about the stability of the dollar or your own financial future?
[00:52:56.356 --> 00:53:01.340]  Is a dismal growth rate or rapid inflation affecting the bottom line of your retirement savings account?

[00:54:10.804 --> 00:54:13.145]  I can't get any relief.
[00:54:13.145 --> 00:54:18.466]  Jimi Hendrix had tapped into what was really going on.
[00:54:32.873 --> 00:54:44.698]  I love the part of this song that says, there are many here among us who think that life is but a joke.
[00:54:44.698 --> 00:54:47.519]  They are... The mind is an incredible thing.
[00:54:47.519 --> 00:54:56.323]  If they willfully want to be stupid and want to be in denial, their mind will engineer itself to build into that reality.
[00:54:56.323 --> 00:54:59.584]  Just what Jordan was saying earlier.
[00:54:59.584 --> 00:55:01.205]  They will decide to believe a lie.
[00:55:04.251 --> 00:55:07.692]  They will decide to be fools.
[00:55:07.692 --> 00:55:18.516]  I can have the Chicago Tribune admitting Don Cort Halliburton kidnapped over a million women and children, put them in slave camps, sell them to people to make snuff films.
[00:55:18.516 --> 00:55:20.397]  They even admit it in the newspaper.
[00:55:20.397 --> 00:55:23.118]  Nobody goes to jail.
[00:55:23.118 --> 00:55:25.579]  Trillions are missing from the Pentagon.
[00:55:25.579 --> 00:55:30.701]  I have all the government documents where they put cancer viruses in the vaccines, poisons in our water.
[00:55:32.105 --> 00:55:35.566]  You tell a yuppie that and they just laugh at you.
[00:55:35.566 --> 00:55:37.187]  It's funny to them.
[00:55:37.187 --> 00:55:42.329]  It's funny because they couldn't face the reality of how horrifying it really is.
[00:55:42.329 --> 00:55:44.230]  They are cowards.
[00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:47.371]  And I'm not somebody full of courage.
[00:55:47.371 --> 00:55:50.192]  If somebody's attacking me, I want to stop it.
[00:55:50.192 --> 00:55:58.776]  But see, these cowards are so cowardly, they could have a lion ripping their guts out and they'd probably deny it and go into a blackout and say, a lion isn't tearing my guts out.
[00:56:00.615 --> 00:56:02.695]  Kind of like the fella being tortured in Brazil.
[00:56:02.695 --> 00:56:04.116]  He goes off into la-la land.
[00:56:04.116 --> 00:56:10.837]  At the end of the film, they're cutting his hand off and he's sitting there humming happily in his mind and they say, oh, he's left us, I'm afraid.
[00:56:10.837 --> 00:56:13.638]  You know, the public has left us, I'm afraid.
[00:56:13.638 --> 00:56:16.818]  Jordan Maxwell, your take on the comments I just made.
[00:56:16.818 --> 00:56:21.019]  Boy, I can't comment on it because you said exactly what I'm thinking.
[00:56:21.019 --> 00:56:25.380]  That's precisely the point, that the public has left their sanity.
[00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:28.781]  They have been robbed of their sanity and their humanity.
[00:56:31.839 --> 00:56:33.500]  I don't know what to do about it.
[00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:39.782]  At this point, I just do the best I can to try and help people who want to be helped.
[00:56:39.782 --> 00:56:42.523]  Those who don't want to hear it, they're not going to hear it anyway.
[00:56:42.523 --> 00:56:49.946]  Finishing up with Crouch, though, I grew up by Bob Tilton, Larry Lee, a bunch of other preachers.
[00:56:52.351 --> 00:57:01.040]  I didn't see the Lees doing a bunch of partying, but with Tilton and some others, I mean, I saw incredible stuff that I won't even say on air in our neighborhood.
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:01.740]  Oh, I know.
[00:57:01.740 --> 00:57:03.182]  I can imagine.
[00:57:03.182 --> 00:57:05.604]  That's what I'm talking about, but people love it.
[00:57:05.604 --> 00:57:11.190]  I mean, every time you turn on television, the place is just crowded with people and they're just enjoying it.
[00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:26.774]  And what it just blows my mind on this is that you see thousands and thousands of people, you know, coming to these churches to listen and they're learning nothing.
[00:57:27.817 --> 00:57:31.641]  Actually, intellectually, learning nothing.
[00:57:31.641 --> 00:57:41.930]  And 20 years later, they're still jumping around, singing hymns and loving the Lord, and have no idea in the world how to read.
[00:57:41.930 --> 00:57:44.453]  That the Lord is Baphomet.
[00:57:44.453 --> 00:57:48.256]  Yeah, it's just incredible ignorance.
[00:57:48.256 --> 00:57:52.180]  People who cannot read, they don't think, they don't question anything.
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:58:03.703]  Uh, it's just, uh, and, and that's why the entire human race is going under, because the human family have lost their ability to even think.
[00:58:03.703 --> 00:58:10.325]  Now, now, Jordan, we gotta start the next hour, and it's only a 60-second break, 70-second with the tag, so stay there.
[00:58:10.325 --> 00:58:13.286]  I really wanna get into whatever it is you wanna cover, whatever areas.
[00:58:13.846 --> 00:58:15.127]  You want to cover when we get back.
[00:58:15.127 --> 00:58:20.972]  I want to bring up a few controversies, a few issues, uh, as well, uh, with you.
[00:58:20.972 --> 00:58:23.875]  And you've agreed, he's agreed to stay 20-30 minutes to the next hour.
[00:58:23.875 --> 00:58:27.678]  Uh, after that, we've got another hour and 20 minutes at least.
[00:58:27.678 --> 00:58:33.543]  Jordan Maxwell, straight ahead.
[00:58:33.543 --> 00:58:37.065]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:37.065 --> 00:58:38.907]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:42.589 --> 00:58:48.339]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[00:58:48.339 --> 00:58:49.581]  And we knew what to do.
[00:58:50.350 --> 00:58:51.630]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:58.672]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:58:58.672 --> 00:59:07.574]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:59:07.574 --> 00:59:14.356]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:59:14.656 --> 00:59:17.838]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:59:17.838 --> 00:59:23.602]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[00:59:23.602 --> 00:59:26.704]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[00:59:44.713 --> 00:59:47.102]  Waging War on Corruption!

[01:00:05.869 --> 01:00:07.991]  JordanMaxwell.com.

[01:00:12.575 --> 01:00:15.878]  Links up on InfoWars.com.
[01:00:15.878 --> 01:00:29.369]  Continue the rest of the hour with us, and then for internet listeners and TV viewers at PrisonPlanet.TV, we'll continue about 20, maybe 30 minutes uninterrupted in the, uh, overdrive time to take phone calls.
[01:00:29.369 --> 01:00:32.152]  We'll do that off my phone system in my studio.
[01:00:32.812 --> 01:00:39.838]  So that is coming up from PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and folks listening on the InfoWars.com streams.
[01:00:39.838 --> 01:00:41.979]  Okay, going back to Jordan Maxwell.
[01:00:41.979 --> 01:00:48.224]  This is another short break and a long one's coming up, Jordan, but I'm gonna go ahead and skip this break to note the network so we can continue to 20 after.
[01:00:50.799 --> 01:00:52.320]  You know, I never get into infighting.
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:55.301]  I never really talk about groups fighting with each other.
[01:00:55.301 --> 01:00:58.903]  People try to even get us to, you know, pick fights with each other.
[01:00:58.903 --> 01:01:00.584]  They try to get other people to do it.
[01:01:00.584 --> 01:01:02.385]  I've noticed you never get involved in all that.
[01:01:03.753 --> 01:01:11.379]  Jordan, but you have pioneered so much of the research that is now the mainstay of a lot of people out there.
[01:01:11.379 --> 01:01:16.563]  And then I get people emailing me saying, what's going on with Jordan Maxwell and this researcher?
[01:01:16.563 --> 01:01:18.425]  What's going on with Jordan Maxwell and that researcher?
[01:01:18.425 --> 01:01:22.408]  And then I go look it up and find out you've said nothing or done nothing.
[01:01:22.408 --> 01:01:26.472]  And that's how the disinfo people, they're key at getting us to fight with each other.
[01:01:27.272 --> 01:01:37.636]  But just on record, I mean, tell me about some of the people you woke up to the New World Order, some of the people you educated, who then kind of took your work and then added on to it or did their own thing.
[01:01:37.636 --> 01:01:43.918]  I mean, go through some of the folks that we could say that you first met or that you woke up.
[01:01:43.918 --> 01:01:50.800]  Well, I mean, classic example is back in 88 when I first started going public.
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:53.981]  I had a family that I was very close to out here.
[01:01:54.834 --> 01:02:04.060]  And one of the boys, I mean one of the girls in the family, her name was Gloria.
[01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:05.601]  Gloria was a young girl.
[01:02:05.601 --> 01:02:10.884]  She used to come over to my office in Glendale when I was first going public.
[01:02:10.884 --> 01:02:15.887]  And she would tell me about how she just loved what I was doing and loved all the research.
[01:02:15.887 --> 01:02:16.627]  And I knew her.
[01:02:16.627 --> 01:02:17.368]  I knew the family.
[01:02:18.141 --> 01:02:24.863]  And so I suspected nothing, and she asked if she could photocopy all my documents and materials that I was working on.
[01:02:24.863 --> 01:02:29.824]  And of course, so I gave her boxes upon boxes over a two-day period.
[01:02:29.824 --> 01:02:41.728]  There was a photocopy shop in the building I was in, so she just spent all day, all afternoon and all evening photocopying all the research materials and documents and everything that I had.
[01:02:42.635 --> 01:02:54.586]  And later on, about a year later, I get a phone call from a mutual friend that knew both Gloria and myself, and said, Jordan, uh, you know, there's a new book out with all of your work in it.
[01:02:54.586 --> 01:02:56.748]  Uh, the guy's name was Fritz Springmeier.
[01:02:56.748 --> 01:02:59.830]  It's called Bloodlines of the Illuminati.
[01:02:59.830 --> 01:03:01.552]  And I was shocked.
[01:03:01.552 --> 01:03:07.477]  And I, so I called Fritz Springmeier, and I said, Fritz, what is this book, Bloodlines of the Illuminati?
[01:03:08.414 --> 01:03:12.337]  And he said, well, uh, Jordan, anybody could have done that kind of research.
[01:03:12.337 --> 01:03:14.118]  Anybody could have done that.
[01:03:14.118 --> 01:03:18.441]  I said, yeah, anyone could have done it, but it was me that did it.
[01:03:18.441 --> 01:03:27.528]  And consequently, uh, you know, now it's a big book out there, Bloodline to the Illuminati, which Fred Springmeyer got from Jordan Maxwell and never even said, thank you.
[01:03:27.528 --> 01:03:27.928]  I mean, I,
[01:03:28.582 --> 01:03:40.417]  I gave John Rappaport a job but he didn't have a job and sat for hours with John Rappaport and told him about my work in San Diego when I brought him in and hired him to work with me.
[01:03:40.417 --> 01:03:44.722]  Later on he creates a book called The Secret Behind Secret Societies.
[01:03:44.722 --> 01:03:45.363]  It's all my work.
[01:03:46.289 --> 01:03:55.094]  And of course I work with Richard Hoagland and Zachariah Sitchin around the world five times, and I met the company of Truth Seekers.
[01:03:55.094 --> 01:03:58.836]  And Zachariah I have the highest respect for, a wonderful man.
[01:03:58.836 --> 01:04:01.598]  And Richard Hoagland is still a great friend of mine.
[01:04:01.598 --> 01:04:04.680]  But I've worked with so many people, and then when I hear
[01:04:05.519 --> 01:04:12.542]  Uh, lecturers like, uh, Jim Mars and Tex Mars, especially Jim Mars, talking about Illuminati and secret societies.
[01:04:12.542 --> 01:04:16.824]  I think, hell, I was talking about that stuff back in sixty-two.
[01:04:16.824 --> 01:04:19.205]  I was talking about that forty-five years ago.
[01:04:19.205 --> 01:04:31.211]  But Jordan, I mean, you, that's also a sign of your success, uh, and, and Myron Fagans and others, that we do want other people to go out and, and, and put the information out.
[01:04:31.211 --> 01:04:31.871]  Of course we do.
[01:04:31.871 --> 01:04:33.592]  But I can certainly see in a case where
[01:04:34.713 --> 01:04:38.437]  You think somebody went and got your material and then put it into a book and gave you no credit?
[01:04:38.437 --> 01:04:48.688]  Uh, that is, uh, bad, but, I mean, at the same time, um... Well, hold on, we're gonna continue on through this break for folks on the internet talking, and we'll come back for everybody else in a sec.
[01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:56.846]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:04:56.846 --> 01:04:59.489]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:04:59.489 --> 01:05:01.030]  But who is the enemy?
[01:05:01.030 --> 01:05:01.831]  Bin Laden.
[01:05:01.831 --> 01:05:02.812]  This is his ammo.
[01:05:02.812 --> 01:05:04.213]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:05:04.213 --> 01:05:05.074]  We have to look to Osama.
[01:05:05.114 --> 01:05:05.374]  Some U.S.
[01:05:05.374 --> 01:05:08.578]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:05:20.171 --> 01:05:23.653]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:05:23.653 --> 01:05:26.474]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:05:50.219 --> 01:05:52.161]  Government is best, which governs least.
[01:05:52.161 --> 01:05:53.622]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:05:53.622 --> 01:05:56.664]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:05:56.664 --> 01:05:59.707]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:05:59.707 --> 01:06:02.929]  It's not who votes that counts, it's who counts the votes.
[01:06:02.929 --> 01:06:09.715]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:07:58.593 --> 01:08:08.386]  Okay, to be clear, uh, Jordan has always been a very magnanimous, very friendly, uh, very, you know, helping, generous person.
[01:08:08.386 --> 01:08:11.090]  And I've talked to him on and off there.
[01:08:11.090 --> 01:08:12.331]  His main point is...
[01:08:13.953 --> 01:08:33.526]  Like you said your own words is that it's not that only that people take a lot of his work and don't give him credit It's that he then gets emails and post about oh this person came out with this and Jordan took it And I think that's and then people start fights up between people and I was just talking to Jordan He's saying he won't be doing very many interviews in the future.
[01:08:33.526 --> 01:08:36.128]  It was hard to get even get Jordan on We called him a few months ago.
[01:08:36.128 --> 01:08:42.512]  He said he wasn't doing interviews anymore And then later he called back and said okay, I'll come on which we're very thankful for he is ill.
[01:08:42.512 --> 01:08:43.313]  He needs our support
[01:08:43.873 --> 01:08:49.215]  He's our financial support, he deserves that, and we'll tell you how to get some of his books and videos before he leaves us.
[01:08:49.215 --> 01:08:52.396]  They're all at JordanMaxwell.com, and there you go, but we'll talk more about them.
[01:08:52.396 --> 01:08:54.337]  But I mean, let's walk through that.
[01:08:54.337 --> 01:09:03.180]  Specifically on your own words, you were telling me during the last little behind-the-scenes interview we were doing for the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers that yes,
[01:09:04.820 --> 01:09:19.349]  That people make these fights up, and I think it is people in the government in this info, to get researchers fighting, where people will then say, Jordan Maxwell took this guy's research, and you're laughing because you were around 40 years before they even showed up.
[01:09:19.349 --> 01:09:23.211]  You were around before I was a zygote in my mother's womb.
[01:09:23.211 --> 01:09:30.275]  You were doing this, you know, 40 years before, you know, other people popped up on the scene.
[01:09:31.081 --> 01:09:50.645]  I've said that even to audiences, that some of the people that are out there talking today about this subject of secret societies, the Illuminati, Bible codes, Knights Templars, international banking, all of that stuff I was talking about back in the 60s, early 60s, 62.
[01:09:50.645 --> 01:09:57.327]  Like I said at the beginning, I used to send a lot of articles to the Bird Society way back in 60, 61.
[01:09:59.467 --> 01:10:09.636]  I was giving a lecture in downtown Hollywood in East Hollywood to a Christian group the day that John Kennedy was assassinated.
[01:10:09.636 --> 01:10:21.446]  I was giving a lecture in downtown Hollywood on secret societies and occult religions in 1963 when Kennedy was assassinated.
[01:10:21.446 --> 01:10:23.027]  I've been talking about this stuff for 48 years.
[01:10:24.068 --> 01:10:25.828]  Well, we owe a debt to you.
[01:10:25.828 --> 01:10:35.970]  I mean, let's briefly talk about some of the shoulders that you and others stand on so that we can stand on yours in this fight against tyranny and lies and fraud and dehumanization and greed and control.
[01:10:35.970 --> 01:10:37.431]  You were saying Myron Fagan.
[01:10:37.431 --> 01:10:39.291]  What about Eustace Mullins?
[01:10:39.291 --> 01:10:43.652]  I mean, his work on the Federal Reserve, he really was the guy helping get the book.
[01:10:43.652 --> 01:10:44.492]  Oh, yeah.
[01:10:44.492 --> 01:10:45.232]  Oh, yeah.
[01:10:45.232 --> 01:10:49.833]  Eustace Mullins did tremendous research for days and weeks and months.
[01:10:50.614 --> 01:10:53.017]  Uh, writing and has paid the price for it.
[01:10:53.017 --> 01:10:54.438]  Has repelled, I mean, he helped get it.
[01:10:54.438 --> 01:10:56.321]  Has repelled, absolutely.
[01:10:56.321 --> 01:10:58.604]  And, uh, and many before that.
[01:10:58.604 --> 01:11:05.613]  So, and I've always said, and I'm famous for saying that, that I'm not the world's foremost authority on anything, right?
[01:11:06.133 --> 01:11:10.534]  I'm just an ordinary man interested in extraordinary knowledge.
[01:11:10.534 --> 01:11:21.716]  Well, I think the key here is though, you codified so much of it, and before you came along, you'd have to go read a hundred high-level Masonic books, you'd have to go to the libraries, look at the real meanings of gods.
[01:11:21.716 --> 01:11:32.618]  So what you did is, that knowledge was there, but that was kind of their internal knowledge, and so you did bring to the world so much of what's going on today.
[01:11:32.618 --> 01:11:33.598]  I've seen online
[01:11:34.358 --> 01:11:37.619]  A little, you know, people trying to create a controversy between you and David Icke.
[01:11:37.619 --> 01:11:43.302]  Tell me, I mean, just to set the record straight, because people try to stir up stuff between you guys, let's set the record straight.
[01:11:43.302 --> 01:11:44.522]  What's really happening there?
[01:11:44.522 --> 01:11:56.427]  Well, I appreciate that, because I've been wanting to talk about this for a long time, because there is a lot, I get a lot of emails and phone calls about, well, you said this about David Icke, or David Icke said that.
[01:11:56.427 --> 01:12:00.969]  First of all, I don't have any problems with anything David Icke is talking about.
[01:12:01.747 --> 01:12:07.016]  As a matter of fact, I gave him a lot, and he's gotten a lot from me.
[01:12:07.016 --> 01:12:13.186]  But I did, in point of fact, myself, in 1992, I brought David Icke to America.
[01:12:13.186 --> 01:12:14.368]  I'm the one that brought him here.
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:29.327]  And I was in San Diego at the time, and a young lady named Alice Ferguson came to my office in San Diego with a man, a friend of hers, named David Griffith.
[01:12:29.327 --> 01:12:32.068]  And Alice Ferguson, David Griffith, came to my office.
[01:12:32.068 --> 01:12:35.490]  I was pretty much running a company down in San Diego.
[01:12:36.130 --> 01:12:48.636]  called Truth Seeker Company, and she asked me if I would help bring her friend to America, who was doing, who was very interested in all my work, and he was trying to do the same thing in England.
[01:12:48.636 --> 01:12:50.437]  So I said, well, who is this person?
[01:12:50.437 --> 01:12:52.918]  And so she said, it's David Icke.
[01:12:52.918 --> 01:12:58.620]  So I listened to her for about an hour, and we talked about it, and I said, alright, I'll tell you what I'll do.
[01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:01.862]  I'll give both you and David Griffin a job.
[01:13:01.862 --> 01:13:02.942]  I'll pay both of you $2,500 a month,
[01:13:05.277 --> 01:13:06.278]  I don't know.
[01:13:26.332 --> 01:13:47.718]  Both had the credit cards for the foundation, the corporation, and so I financed her, Alice Ferguson, and ultimately David Icke, to come to America, to go to Australia, to go to Canada, and all of that cost money to fly all over the world and to set up lectures for David Icke.
[01:13:49.096 --> 01:14:06.140]  And, uh, and eventually, uh, Alice Ferguson talked with, uh, Bonnie Lang, the, the, the lady who was running the company, and a couple of other women in the office, and they decided that, why don't we just fire Jordan Maxwell, get rid of him, and bring David Icke in to take his place?
[01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:07.240]  And so that's what happened.
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:13.541]  I got fired, uh, by the same people that I tried to help and bring David Icke to America.
[01:14:13.541 --> 01:14:16.302]  I got fired so that David could take my job.
[01:14:17.285 --> 01:14:24.592]  But after they fired me, they found out that David was not interested in sitting in an office running a company like Jordan Maxwell.
[01:14:24.592 --> 01:14:28.756]  So then the company went downhill from there because I was gone.
[01:14:28.756 --> 01:14:31.999]  And they had already fired me and David didn't want the job.
[01:14:32.814 --> 01:14:39.797]  And so they just cut their nose off despite their face, and so the Truth Seeker Company is now defunct and is no longer around.
[01:14:39.797 --> 01:14:47.201]  Of course, at that time I was helping because I had access to the corporation funds.
[01:14:47.201 --> 01:14:51.203]  I was helping Richard Hoagland, Zachariah Sitchin.
[01:14:51.203 --> 01:14:54.425]  As I said, John Rapoport had no job.
[01:14:54.425 --> 01:14:57.066]  I called John Rapoport, gave him a job.
[01:14:57.706 --> 01:15:07.375]  Got him started again, and he went out and wrote a book on my work called Secret Societies.
[01:15:07.375 --> 01:15:17.784]  And of course, I don't know if we were on the air at the time when we were talking about the Fritz Springmeier with the bloodlines of the Illuminati, but all of that was taken from me back in 1988.
[01:15:19.637 --> 01:15:19.997]  I don't
[01:15:40.010 --> 01:15:44.232]  And, uh, just the working class people in the studios would give me a pass.
[01:15:44.232 --> 01:15:48.455]  Yeah, I know, uh, some say that they took the idea of the Matrix from you.
[01:15:48.455 --> 01:15:49.355]  Is that true?
[01:15:49.355 --> 01:15:58.040]  Well, uh, I had a video called Matrix of Power about ten years before the movie Matrix came out.
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:05.464]  But I don't think that they, well, maybe they might have been influenced by the Matrix because it was a big seller when it came out.
[01:16:05.464 --> 01:16:06.244]  One never knows.
[01:16:06.244 --> 01:16:07.325]  But what I do know
[01:16:08.090 --> 01:16:08.410]  Is that
[01:16:27.384 --> 01:16:37.152]  Out of that, at the very beginning of the basic slide presentation, and get that and watch it, and then get the movie, Da Vinci Code.
[01:16:37.152 --> 01:16:56.068]  And it is exactly, word for word, exactly, in the Da Vinci Code, at the beginning of the movie, they introduce Tom Hanks as the world's foremost researcher in occult societies and secret societies, and he comes up on the stage,
[01:16:56.841 --> 01:16:57.221]  This is a
[01:17:12.629 --> 01:17:25.438]  The projection, so some of it is being projected on him, and he's now pointing to the pyramid, the all-seeing eye, etc., and talking about the Illuminati and secret societies on the dollar bill, etc.
[01:17:25.438 --> 01:17:30.742]  That came directly out of my Basics Live presentation, period.
[01:17:31.912 --> 01:17:32.612]  Period.
[01:17:32.612 --> 01:17:38.376]  It came directly out of my video and nobody ever called me to send me a check.
[01:17:38.376 --> 01:17:39.196]  Da Vinci Code.
[01:17:39.196 --> 01:17:44.319]  Of course, the whole idea of Da Vinci Code was a rip-off of Bajent Lee and Lincoln.
[01:17:44.319 --> 01:17:58.346]  The entire movie, Da Vinci Code, was an absolute rip-off of the British writers Bajent Lee and Lincoln and their book that appeared about 15 years before the movie called Holy Blood, Holy Grail.
[01:17:58.346 --> 01:18:01.108]  And so the producers of Da Vinci Code ripped off
[01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:22.324]  Major Lee and Lincoln's book uh... holy blood holy grail and made it into a movie and uh... and act like they would they came up with something new and there was a lawsuit in England because of that so I'm not the only one that's been ripped off and lied to and cheated and left for dead there's a lot of good people out there.
[01:18:22.324 --> 01:18:29.945]  You've made such a contribution to fighting the New World Order Jordan that I don't normally even air laundry on the show but it's important that
[01:18:30.465 --> 01:18:35.087]  That you'd be recognized for the work you've done, and some people appreciate the work you've done.
[01:18:35.087 --> 01:18:39.989]  Now I want to shift gears for the rest of this hour into the biggest secrets, the biggest issues.
[01:18:39.989 --> 01:18:41.390]  You know, what makes them tick?
[01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:46.272]  Big, broad, you know, basic info, and we can go back into more detail.
[01:18:46.272 --> 01:18:57.137]  Okay, then let me say, then, if you're up for that, just remember that when you ask for something, you know, make sure you're ready for it, because
[01:18:58.644 --> 01:19:03.547]  You know, make sure what you ask for you're ready for because it might be something that you weren't expecting.
[01:19:29.465 --> 01:19:33.928]  And the guest he has on, and all my guests, can talk about whatever they want.
[01:19:33.928 --> 01:19:35.509]  The callers can talk about whatever they want.
[01:19:35.509 --> 01:19:36.950]  We don't screen calls.
[01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:37.310]  Nothing.
[01:19:37.310 --> 01:19:40.813]  Anybody that says otherwise is a liar.
[01:19:40.813 --> 01:19:41.473]  Stay there.
[01:19:41.473 --> 01:19:44.475]  Quick break, Jordan, and we'll come back.
[01:19:44.475 --> 01:19:50.260]  You've got a couple minute break you can take, and we'll be right back.
[01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:51.581]  It is a big idea.
[01:19:52.719 --> 01:19:54.480]  A New World Order!
[01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:58.983]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:19:58.983 --> 01:20:02.204]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:20:02.204 --> 01:20:05.006]  Don't their objective be world domination?
[01:20:05.006 --> 01:20:08.188]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:20:08.188 --> 01:20:15.492]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:20:18.510 --> 01:20:23.974]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:20:23.974 --> 01:20:27.838]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:20:27.838 --> 01:20:30.400]  The Overbearing is making great progress toward a world which I believe in.
[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:31.581]  Most people have no idea.
[01:20:31.581 --> 01:20:32.361]  They're not after money.
[01:20:32.361 --> 01:20:33.642]  They have all the money they need.
[01:20:33.642 --> 01:20:34.623]  They're after power.
[01:20:34.623 --> 01:20:35.764]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[01:20:45.252 --> 01:20:46.753]  Blueprint for global enslaving.
[01:20:47.253 --> 01:20:49.153]  You have been warned.
[01:20:49.153 --> 01:20:49.934]  Gold.
[01:20:49.934 --> 01:20:51.474]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:20:51.474 --> 01:20:57.755]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:20:57.755 --> 01:21:01.916]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:21:01.916 --> 01:21:03.856]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:21:03.856 --> 01:21:06.297]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:21:06.297 --> 01:21:12.938]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker.
[01:21:12.978 --> 01:21:13.458]  We're good to go.
[01:21:37.911 --> 01:21:39.914]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:39.914 --> 01:21:44.041]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.
[01:21:44.041 --> 01:21:45.222]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[01:21:49.258 --> 01:21:53.041]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[01:21:53.041 --> 01:21:58.066]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[01:21:58.066 --> 01:22:03.531]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[01:22:03.531 --> 01:22:14.040]  Though the people of the U.S., where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reigning them in and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:18.922]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[01:22:18.922 --> 01:22:21.683]  They oppose everything that is God and Truth.
[01:22:21.683 --> 01:22:25.265]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[01:22:25.265 --> 01:22:37.771]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the Earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.

[01:22:46.291 --> 01:22:47.554]  The message of his kingdom.
[01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:52.043]  Hello, this is Tom with HempUSA.org.
[01:22:52.043 --> 01:22:59.789]  Most of you have been hearing my ads for the past few months, and it's no secret that the economy is failing and prices are rising in all sectors.

[01:23:52.333 --> 01:23:58.835]  Alright, we're going to skip the next break if you're an InfoWars.com internet stream listener or PrisonPlanet.tv subscriber.
[01:23:58.835 --> 01:24:01.896]  Everybody else will continue after the next break with Jordan Maxwell.
[01:24:01.896 --> 01:24:06.918]  We're going to go 20 minutes at least into overdrive to take phone calls for Jordan Maxwell.
[01:24:06.918 --> 01:24:10.419]  I'll give you that number at the end of the show.
[01:24:10.419 --> 01:24:18.562]  Okay, Jordan, should we start at the end with the globalist master plan, the New World Order, what they want to build on Earth?
[01:24:18.562 --> 01:24:21.063]  Sometimes that's the best way to start, or should we start at the beginning?
[01:24:21.781 --> 01:24:25.123]  Well, I'll tell you what, start at the beginning and let me say this.
[01:24:25.123 --> 01:24:32.346]  I don't really want to get into the political part of this because we don't have a whole lot of time left.
[01:24:32.346 --> 01:24:37.809]  And besides, everyone who needs to know already knows how bad off we are.
[01:24:38.562 --> 01:24:41.383]  I'd like to talk about some subjects that maybe we don't know.
[01:24:41.383 --> 01:24:45.065]  Okay, but I do want to get your take on what their final master plan is.
[01:24:45.065 --> 01:24:51.388]  I mean, I know what your view is, but also I want to get your latest take, your latest analysis on what their endgame is.
[01:24:51.388 --> 01:24:54.310]  But sure, go ahead and start at the beginning.
[01:24:54.310 --> 01:25:01.693]  Okay, well, then everybody should get a piece of paper and a pencil and write down a couple words I'm going to give you.
[01:25:01.693 --> 01:25:06.976]  Because I believe these are key words to open up a can of worms that you will not believe.
[01:25:07.865 --> 01:25:14.709]  It's going to open up a whole world of research to you that you've never known existed.
[01:25:14.709 --> 01:25:18.252]  The first word is Hanseatic League.
[01:25:18.252 --> 01:25:23.395]  Spell H-A-N-S-E-A-T-I-C.
[01:25:23.395 --> 01:25:25.276]  Hanseatic League.
[01:25:25.276 --> 01:25:27.317]  It's on my website.
[01:25:27.317 --> 01:25:36.043]  If you go to my website and go to the Research Department, it goes to the Research, you will see a box saying, Words to Research.
[01:25:36.821 --> 01:25:43.042]  Go on the Words to Research and check down into the H's and you'll see Hanseatic League.
[01:25:43.042 --> 01:25:49.264]  The Hanseatic League is extremely important to the Illuminati story today.
[01:25:49.264 --> 01:25:59.146]  And connected to the Hanseatic League, which most people don't even know exists, is something called, and write it down, Teutonic Zionism.
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:04.001]  It is not Semitic Jewish Zionism.
[01:26:04.001 --> 01:26:04.881]  No.
[01:26:04.881 --> 01:26:06.502]  The word is Teutonic.
[01:26:06.502 --> 01:26:10.843]  T-E-U-T-O-N-I-C.
[01:26:10.843 --> 01:26:15.105]  The Teutonic Knights are the German branch of the Knights Templars.
[01:26:15.105 --> 01:26:16.165]  That's right.
[01:26:16.165 --> 01:26:17.525]  That's the name of the tomb.
[01:26:17.525 --> 01:26:20.406]  The Teutonic Zionism.
[01:26:20.406 --> 01:26:26.148]  It's a whole secret order that has been in operation for a thousand years.
[01:26:26.992 --> 01:26:34.699]  It is the whole story behind America, England, and those things which are going on on the Earth today.
[01:26:34.699 --> 01:26:44.787]  And if you don't understand Hanseatic League and Teutonic Zionism, you're never going to figure out the name of the tune and how this thing is being played.
[01:26:44.787 --> 01:26:52.294]  And I've been looking at this for 48 years, and I'm telling you that unless and until you have the whole story,
[01:26:52.975 --> 01:27:07.825]  You're not going to get to the bottom of anything, because like I said in the beginning, the first hour, your decisions in life are only as good as your information, and the really extraordinary information has never been allowed to be given to the people.
[01:27:07.825 --> 01:27:13.068]  So I'm just getting you started into a truly arcane occult research.
[01:27:13.068 --> 01:27:20.192]  Well, on the Teutonic Knights that really grew into the Templars and vice versa, after they knocked out the Templars, there was still the Teutonic Knights.
[01:27:20.192 --> 01:27:22.094]  I only know about the Teutonic Knights because I read
[01:27:22.734 --> 01:27:30.503]  Mind comp, I read other books about the Nazis and Hitler thought that he was creating the recreated Teutonic Knights.
[01:27:30.503 --> 01:27:31.905]  We know the British follow that.
[01:27:31.905 --> 01:27:32.946]  That's right.
[01:27:32.946 --> 01:27:37.611]  And again, this goes back to them believing they're the seed of Jesus, they're the God race.
[01:27:37.611 --> 01:27:38.552]  No, you're getting it.
[01:27:38.552 --> 01:27:40.795]  That's exactly right.
[01:27:40.795 --> 01:27:42.277]  And so that's why people can't get why
[01:27:43.726 --> 01:27:47.810]  The political Zionists, who were supposedly Jewish, were funding Hitler.
[01:27:47.810 --> 01:27:52.594]  Why Hitler allowed Jews to leave to Israel, but nowhere else?
[01:27:52.594 --> 01:27:57.659]  Why, at the highest levels, you'll have Zionists right next to top Nazis at Bilderberg?
[01:27:57.659 --> 01:27:58.540]  And it's right.
[01:27:58.540 --> 01:28:04.125]  I've said, when you kick in that final door, it's a room full of Nazis and Kabbalists.
[01:28:04.605 --> 01:28:05.545]  That's right.
[01:28:05.545 --> 01:28:09.867]  That's exactly what I'm saying, and that's why I'm saying you better go back and look at this.
[01:28:09.867 --> 01:28:12.969]  And that's what Steven Spielberg is telling us in Writers of the Lost Ark.
[01:28:12.969 --> 01:28:14.669]  He's trying to tell you something.
[01:28:14.669 --> 01:28:15.970]  Twice, the Nazis.
[01:28:15.970 --> 01:28:19.131]  Three times, the last one, the Nazis are in it.
[01:28:19.131 --> 01:28:23.833]  And the first two times, the Nazis are looking for the Lost Ark of the Covenant.
[01:28:23.833 --> 01:28:29.356]  Why would the Nazis care a damn about a Jewish symbol of the Covenant or the
[01:28:30.797 --> 01:28:34.498]  The Covenant of the... The Lost Ark of the Covenant.
[01:28:34.498 --> 01:28:39.279]  Why would Nazis care about the Lost Ark of the Covenant, a Jewish symbol?
[01:28:39.279 --> 01:28:44.700]  Why would they care about the Christian symbol of the Holy Grail?
[01:28:44.700 --> 01:28:48.260]  The second one, the Last Crusade.
[01:28:48.260 --> 01:28:56.782]  Why are the... Why is he putting so much emphasis on the Knights Templars, the Masonic Knights, orders of the Teutonic Knights?
[01:28:58.180 --> 01:29:01.402]  They're trying to tell you something.
[01:29:01.402 --> 01:29:08.344]  And so I'm saying, I've been looking at this for a long time, and I'll tell you what the story is.
[01:29:08.344 --> 01:29:13.186]  Hanseatic League Teutonic Zionism.
[01:29:13.186 --> 01:29:17.228]  It has nothing to do with Jewish Zionism out of the Bible.
[01:29:17.228 --> 01:29:17.808]  Period.
[01:29:17.808 --> 01:29:20.149]  Nothing Jewish about it.
[01:29:20.149 --> 01:29:24.751]  It has to do with a very ancient, prehistoric, ancient concept
[01:29:26.450 --> 01:29:28.891]  Of a totalitarian dictatorship.
[01:29:28.891 --> 01:29:34.494]  As a matter of fact, if you go to any good law dictionary and look up the word FAS.
[01:29:34.494 --> 01:29:35.614]  F-A-S.
[01:29:35.614 --> 01:29:36.535]  FAS.
[01:29:36.535 --> 01:29:40.056]  FAS is a Latin word which means God.
[01:29:40.056 --> 01:29:41.456]  We're on the march.
[01:29:41.456 --> 01:29:43.977]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:43.977 --> 01:29:46.659]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:50.066 --> 01:29:56.829]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:29:56.829 --> 01:29:59.470]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:29:59.470 --> 01:30:01.011]  But who is the enemy?
[01:30:01.011 --> 01:30:01.812]  Bin Laden.
[01:30:01.812 --> 01:30:02.732]  This is his ammo.
[01:30:02.732 --> 01:30:04.173]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:30:04.173 --> 01:30:06.174]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:30:06.174 --> 01:30:13.317]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:30:13.317 --> 01:30:13.797]  Some U.S.
[01:30:13.797 --> 01:30:19.440]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:23.642]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:30:23.642 --> 01:30:26.744]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:30:49.807 --> 01:30:53.230]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[01:30:53.230 --> 01:30:55.552]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[01:30:55.552 --> 01:30:58.835]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[01:30:58.835 --> 01:31:05.721]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[01:31:05.721 --> 01:31:07.843]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[01:31:08.323 --> 01:31:11.626]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[01:31:11.626 --> 01:31:16.410]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[01:31:16.410 --> 01:31:20.354]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[01:31:20.354 --> 01:31:21.975]  Travel less, meet online.

[01:31:49.870 --> 01:31:55.812]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[01:31:55.812 --> 01:32:00.854]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[01:32:00.854 --> 01:32:06.037]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[01:32:06.037 --> 01:32:09.418]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[01:32:09.958 --> 01:32:18.465]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[01:32:18.465 --> 01:32:24.289]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[01:32:24.289 --> 01:32:30.274]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[01:32:30.274 --> 01:32:32.576]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[01:32:32.856 --> 01:32:35.517]  Cannot survive in an alkaline environment.
[01:32:35.517 --> 01:32:41.259]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to AlkaVision.com.
[01:32:41.259 --> 01:32:43.740]  That's A-L-K-A Vision dot com.
[01:32:43.740 --> 01:32:44.801]  Or call 269-344-3420 today.
[01:32:44.801 --> 01:32:47.122]  While you were sleeping, they came and took it all away.
[01:33:08.362 --> 01:33:11.632]  The place is where you used to play.
[01:33:18.854 --> 01:33:21.096]  We're going to continue into the next hour.
[01:33:21.096 --> 01:33:22.597]  Special Overdrive.
[01:33:22.597 --> 01:33:35.507]  And when the retransmission continues, I'll get into Barry Jennings, Deputy Head of Emergency Management, New York, talking about explosions in the buildings, dead bodies in Building 7 before either tower collapsed, destroying the 9-11 Commission Report.
[01:33:35.507 --> 01:33:39.671]  Huge video up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[01:33:46.340 --> 01:33:51.343]  The Supreme Court is set to rule that there is no Second Amendment today.
[01:33:51.343 --> 01:33:55.845]  But in lawyer speak, they're going to say it's a victory for the Second Amendment.
[01:33:55.845 --> 01:33:58.607]  They're not allowed to totally ban guns in D.C.
[01:33:58.607 --> 01:34:03.230]  Now they have to go back and pass a new law that just basically restricts them to nothing, but it has to be done by law.
[01:34:04.346 --> 01:34:05.827]  Uh, that's what they're gonna do.
[01:34:05.827 --> 01:34:10.010]  They've already said they're gonna do it, and you're gonna watch them do it, and that way it neutralizes people.
[01:34:10.010 --> 01:34:12.612]  It's all about deception, all about word games.
[01:34:12.612 --> 01:34:14.293]  They play so many.
[01:34:14.293 --> 01:34:21.077]  They've trained whole cadres of people, compartmentalized to carry out the lies, but they don't see the larger part of how they're destroying themselves.
[01:34:21.077 --> 01:34:23.939]  We'll be back with Jordan Maxwell in just one moment.
[01:34:23.939 --> 01:34:28.882]  Be sure to visit his website, jordanmaxwell.com, and let's just go 30 more minutes into the next hour.
[01:34:28.882 --> 01:34:34.086]  He says he's feeling good and can do it, and we're gonna be taking your phone calls coming up in the next hour, but not yet.
[01:34:35.027 --> 01:34:37.868]  We'll get that number out at the end of the main radio broadcast.
[01:34:37.868 --> 01:34:41.771]  It'll be internet only for the last 30 minutes with Jordan Maxwell.
[01:34:42.691 --> 01:34:51.453]  Before we go back to Jordan, this show is made possible by our sponsors, and one of those sponsors is eFoods Direct.
[01:34:51.453 --> 01:34:56.314]  eFoods Direct is the longest continually operating storable food company in the United States.
[01:34:56.314 --> 01:34:58.594]  They have freeze-dried and dehydrated food.
[01:34:58.594 --> 01:35:12.177]  That means it's high quality, keeps its nutritive value, it's non-GMO, clean, healthy food, balanced, and it is in cans, so it stores for more than 10 years in climate-controlled, 10 years non-climate-controlled,
[01:35:12.777 --> 01:35:14.299]  And it stores in very small areas.
[01:35:14.299 --> 01:35:15.300]  Each can's very heavy.
[01:35:15.300 --> 01:35:17.281]  It's jam-packed.
[01:35:17.281 --> 01:35:19.343]  Very inexpensive.
[01:35:19.343 --> 01:35:25.289]  And with all the food price increases, the talk of depression, it's just good insurance to have storable food.
[01:35:25.289 --> 01:35:25.669]  I do.
[01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:27.531]  I bought from several other companies.
[01:35:27.531 --> 01:35:28.852]  Didn't really like them.
[01:35:28.852 --> 01:35:29.913]  Bought from these guys.
[01:35:29.913 --> 01:35:31.594]  Liked them six, seven years ago.
[01:35:31.594 --> 01:35:32.696]  Bought from them four times.
[01:35:32.696 --> 01:35:34.197]  Bought family food.
[01:35:34.197 --> 01:35:34.998]  And done a lot more.
[01:35:35.918 --> 01:35:47.703]  So, 1-800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com, BigFatBanners at the top of Infowars.com, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:35:47.703 --> 01:35:51.344]  Also, there's the great folks at Inner Health Botanicals.
[01:35:51.344 --> 01:35:58.507]  They're one of the most long-operating and most respected mineral and supplement companies out there.
[01:35:58.507 --> 01:36:00.288]  They don't make magic claims.
[01:36:00.288 --> 01:36:05.150]  They have the well-documented herbs and medicines that have been known to have nutritive and health effects for thousands of years.
[01:36:05.690 --> 01:36:09.472]  Like aloe vera for flushing out your intestines and detoxifying.
[01:36:09.472 --> 01:36:11.073]  Concentrated aloe vera tablets.
[01:36:11.073 --> 01:36:13.534]  It's the equivalent of drinking gallons of the stuff.
[01:36:13.534 --> 01:36:16.055]  And, uh, it's got other herbs that are known for cleaning out your guts.
[01:36:16.055 --> 01:36:16.636]  1-800-569-4056.
[01:36:16.636 --> 01:36:16.716]  1-800-569-4056.
[01:36:16.716 --> 01:36:17.776]  Aloes, colon, body cleanse.
[01:36:17.776 --> 01:36:18.657]  Another one of their products.
[01:36:25.603 --> 01:36:29.351]  Super Beta Prostate with Palmetto and other things.
[01:36:29.351 --> 01:36:33.820]  Most men start having problems with their prostate after 45 and don't find out until they're 60.
[01:36:33.820 --> 01:36:37.047]  These are things that are well known to shrink it to have some effect to help you.
[01:36:37.699 --> 01:36:38.660]  Are they a magic cure?
[01:36:38.660 --> 01:36:38.940]  No.
[01:36:38.940 --> 01:36:39.560]  Do they help?
[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:39.860]  Yes.
[01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:40.340]  1-800-569-4056.
[01:36:40.340 --> 01:36:46.023]  Even medical doctors are now prescribing this.
[01:36:46.023 --> 01:36:47.264]  1-800-569-4056.
[01:36:47.264 --> 01:36:50.606]  BigFatManor on InfoWars.com.
[01:36:50.606 --> 01:36:52.046]  Okay.
[01:36:52.046 --> 01:36:53.687]  Going back to Jordan Maxwell.
[01:36:53.687 --> 01:36:57.929]  He was talking about the Teutonic Zionist.
[01:36:57.929 --> 01:37:01.131]  And again, separately from Jordan Maxwell, because I've been a big reader.
[01:37:02.970 --> 01:37:15.398]  I can confirm what he's saying because I happen to read Heinz Hobel, Order of the Death's Head, Scheer's Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, two of Hitler's books, Mein Kampf and then the New World Order.
[01:37:15.398 --> 01:37:17.900]  I happen to know that they believe in Teutonic Knights.
[01:37:17.900 --> 01:37:20.241]  This predates the Templars.
[01:37:20.241 --> 01:37:22.923]  Mainstream history teaches you the Templars became the Teutonics, but
[01:37:23.866 --> 01:37:34.449]  Really, they were the tree from which the Templars rose, and when that tree was cut down and ran to Northern England or to Scotland, the real heart of it grew back up.
[01:37:34.449 --> 01:37:36.510]  Am I correct in saying that, Jordan?
[01:37:36.510 --> 01:37:37.430]  Yeah, I think you're right.
[01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:42.132]  I think you're right, because the Teutonic thing goes way back into ancient history.
[01:37:42.132 --> 01:37:44.372]  Way back.
[01:37:44.372 --> 01:37:45.373]  Yes.
[01:37:45.373 --> 01:37:47.453]  Yeah, that's a whole study in itself.
[01:37:47.453 --> 01:37:52.675]  That's why I said, put the two together, the Teutonic Zionism, which is
[01:37:54.059 --> 01:37:59.241]  Semitic Zionism, it's Teutonic Zionism, and Hanseatic League.
[01:37:59.241 --> 01:38:04.563]  And again, the word is H-A-N-S-E-A-T-I-C.
[01:38:04.563 --> 01:38:11.685]  Hanseatic League and Teutonic Zionism will begin to open up a can of worms that you're not going to believe.
[01:38:11.685 --> 01:38:13.446]  Well, tell us about the Hanseatic League.
[01:38:13.946 --> 01:38:30.419]  Well, as a league of German bankers and thinkers, philosophers, but especially bankers and commercial enterprises in Germany under the Second Reich, which was under Kaiser Wilhelm and even way before that.
[01:38:31.159 --> 01:38:34.360]  Uh, before the German nation came to be a nation.
[01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:41.664]  So it's a whole confederation of, of bankers, thinkers, philosophers who were basically put together.
[01:38:41.664 --> 01:38:43.644]  They created the modern education system.
[01:38:43.644 --> 01:38:43.944]  That's right.
[01:38:43.944 --> 01:38:45.685]  They created the PhD.
[01:38:45.685 --> 01:38:46.045]  That's it.
[01:38:46.045 --> 01:38:46.526]  You got it.
[01:38:46.526 --> 01:38:48.566]  Uh, they, they engineered the whole society.
[01:38:48.566 --> 01:38:49.907]  They created NASA.
[01:38:49.907 --> 01:38:51.328]  They created our CIA.
[01:38:51.328 --> 01:38:52.008]  Now you got it.
[01:38:52.008 --> 01:38:54.369]  They merged with the British-German aristocracy.
[01:38:55.109 --> 01:38:59.212]  And again, I'm not absolving the modern, corrupt, murderous Zionists.
[01:38:59.212 --> 01:39:13.381]  The point is, I have found that they are actually their plaything, and that they are married in with the Rothschilds, and every time I knock down that final door, this is a Germanic death cult that believes they are the true Zionists.
[01:39:13.681 --> 01:39:14.241]  That's it.
[01:39:14.241 --> 01:39:16.502]  That's the name of the tune and you said it all.
[01:39:16.502 --> 01:39:17.062]  That's it.
[01:39:17.062 --> 01:39:22.345]  So let's move on because... But I mean, all I try to do though is report what I really find in history.
[01:39:22.345 --> 01:39:23.345]  I know.
[01:39:23.345 --> 01:39:25.346]  And I mean, look at who owns the big pharma companies.
[01:39:25.346 --> 01:39:27.267]  Look at who owns the military.
[01:39:27.267 --> 01:39:37.611]  And then it's got to be a debate about the Catholics or it's got to be a debate about the... But then the Catholic system, you know, is trying to set up the new Rome and it's hooked in with the Teutonics, is it not?
[01:39:37.611 --> 01:39:38.491]  Oh, of course it is.
[01:39:38.491 --> 01:39:39.952]  Of course it is.
[01:39:39.952 --> 01:39:41.953]  But then I say it's only part of it.
[01:39:42.313 --> 01:39:50.120]  I mean, I'm saying Zionists, Catholics, all of it, the Protestants, but see, no, they want to keep us compartmentalized, divided, and conquered, don't they?
[01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:50.841]  You're right.
[01:39:50.841 --> 01:39:51.581]  You're right.
[01:39:51.581 --> 01:39:57.987]  That's why I was saying earlier that when you go on my website, there are three books that are showing.
[01:39:57.987 --> 01:40:04.593]  I have other e-books, but once you hit one of the books that are showing, it will take you to the whole e-book section.
[01:40:04.593 --> 01:40:08.977]  But the one in the middle is called Symbols, Sex, and the Stars.
[01:40:09.597 --> 01:40:13.600]  Which I was so taken by when I first found this book in an old bookstore.
[01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:22.507]  I was just absolutely mesmerized by how much information is in there so well easily to read and explain.
[01:40:23.431 --> 01:40:35.556]  About where things come from in the world theology, where it developed, what the words meant, the etymology of the words, and where the concepts and ideas have come from.
[01:40:35.556 --> 01:40:38.037]  It's called Symbols, Sects, and Stars.
[01:40:38.037 --> 01:40:40.838]  I own the copyright on that.
[01:40:40.838 --> 01:40:43.539]  I gave it to my friend so he could publish it.
[01:40:43.539 --> 01:40:47.581]  And then the second one, which was so extraordinarily important,
[01:40:48.388 --> 01:40:53.353]  I asked and got the copyright to own it also.
[01:40:53.353 --> 01:40:58.999]  I not only loved the books, I wanted to own them so I could put them out all over the world.
[01:40:58.999 --> 01:41:03.023]  It's called Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy.
[01:41:03.023 --> 01:41:11.712]  And once you understand how Masonic Astronomy and is connected to the Stellar Theology of the ancient world,
[01:41:12.660 --> 01:41:19.689]  Then all of the words and terms you're hearing in religion and philosophy and astronomy all begin to make sense.
[01:41:19.689 --> 01:41:24.334]  And that's why the Olympics this year are going to be on 888 at 888 in the day.
[01:41:24.334 --> 01:41:31.503]  That's why NASA did the shoots on certain days at certain times, admittedly occultic.
[01:41:31.963 --> 01:41:43.207]  That's why Ronald Reagan only gave speeches in an exact second, on an exact day, with a certain color tie, looking a certain direction, and would walk out and hail his arms in an occultic fashion before he did it.
[01:41:43.207 --> 01:41:44.747]  That's why Bill Clinton's upset.
[01:41:44.747 --> 01:41:52.630]  They really believe this, and they believe that by extension all the power they have, they believe it's real, and they believe they're communing with entities, don't they?
[01:41:52.630 --> 01:42:00.653]  That's exactly right, and the mere fact, I mean, you know, by their fruits you shall know them, the mere fact that they are the power
[01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:07.164]  Tells you that there very well might be something in fact legitimate about it.
[01:42:07.164 --> 01:42:20.852]  That there very well might be an occult hidden dark force in the universe that we call the occult magical system that we put into movies like Matrix.
[01:42:21.644 --> 01:42:30.329]  But there is, in point of fact, a legitimate, de jure, real, magical system operating on the Earth.
[01:42:30.329 --> 01:42:48.921]  Now, let's be clear, for atheists out there, if you go research your atheistic founders, you will find they're funded by a cultic and theophics, you know, different societies, and that the world leaders who are telling you not to believe anything, they are obsessed with this, aren't they?
[01:42:49.341 --> 01:42:50.082]  Absolutely.
[01:42:50.082 --> 01:42:51.043]  No doubt about it.
[01:42:51.043 --> 01:42:53.486]  And Washington, D.C.
[01:42:53.486 --> 01:42:55.969]  is just filled with occult symbolism.
[01:42:55.969 --> 01:42:57.431]  Oh, it's everywhere.
[01:42:57.431 --> 01:42:58.792]  Everywhere.
[01:42:58.792 --> 01:43:05.741]  We go to the Washington Monument, and you know how many people go to the Washington Monument and see the Washington Monument and are
[01:43:06.321 --> 01:43:18.546]  And are so proud to stand there and have a picture taken with the Washington Monument, never realizing that the Washington Monument is a phallic symbol for the phallic worship in Egypt.
[01:43:18.546 --> 01:43:20.066]  Or all these Baptist churches.
[01:43:20.066 --> 01:43:24.708]  I mean, you'll tell a Baptist preacher that and he'll giggle and laugh and wink at you, because most of them are Masons.
[01:43:24.708 --> 01:43:25.288]  That's right.
[01:43:25.288 --> 01:43:26.609]  I mean, they know.
[01:43:26.609 --> 01:43:28.089]  It's funny to them.
[01:43:28.089 --> 01:43:33.011]  Look, I've had so many people contact me, emails and phone.
[01:43:33.801 --> 01:43:35.482]  Asking me, well, what about this?
[01:43:35.482 --> 01:43:37.083]  And what can you tell me about that?
[01:43:37.083 --> 01:43:38.183]  Well, I'm just one man.
[01:43:38.183 --> 01:43:41.065]  I can't talk to the whole world one man at a time.
[01:43:41.065 --> 01:43:48.708]  But, when people call me and ask me, I tell them, look, I've had a website for 15 years.
[01:43:48.708 --> 01:43:51.770]  I've had stuff on that one subject you just asked me about.
[01:43:51.770 --> 01:43:58.613]  In my research department, did you go to the research boxes on my website?
[01:43:58.613 --> 01:43:59.354]  No.
[01:43:59.354 --> 01:44:01.855]  Well, did you go to the links on my website?
[01:44:01.855 --> 01:44:01.895]  No.
[01:44:02.799 --> 01:44:07.580]  Did you see the pictures and the downloadable documents?
[01:44:07.580 --> 01:44:08.641]  No.
[01:44:08.641 --> 01:44:11.521]  Well, did you get any of the e-books that were there?
[01:44:11.521 --> 01:44:13.262]  No, I didn't see any e-books.
[01:44:13.262 --> 01:44:30.847]  So I want to take this opportunity to say, anyone who goes on my website, understand there is at least 48 years of knowledge and work that I have put into my website of stuff that you will never be privy to know even exists.
[01:44:31.647 --> 01:44:36.368]  So when you go to my website, don't just look at the homepage and up a couple of pictures.
[01:44:36.368 --> 01:44:42.670]  Go all through it, and especially on the audio video page and the links page.
[01:44:42.670 --> 01:44:44.411]  I've got stuff on links pages.
[01:44:44.411 --> 01:44:48.012]  I don't put links on my website to take up room.
[01:44:48.012 --> 01:44:51.213]  I put them on because they are very important to me.
[01:44:51.213 --> 01:44:54.474]  Now, now, now, now, Jordan, I want to move quickly here.
[01:44:54.474 --> 01:44:58.035]  You also told me privately that you may not be doing radio much longer.
[01:44:58.035 --> 01:44:59.275]  Two Sundays from now,
[01:44:59.915 --> 01:45:09.402]  You're going to be joining us for the full two hours, and if you really are talking about hanging up your hat here, I want to get you up even sooner back on this show.
[01:45:09.402 --> 01:45:16.106]  I mean, you say you're ill, you don't feel well, you're losing the drive, but I hear that drive reigniting once we get you on air.
[01:45:16.106 --> 01:45:19.028]  Any ballpark on when you may hang it up?
[01:45:19.028 --> 01:45:25.833]  I get excited in my spirit when I'm in the company of someone like yourself, Alex, that appreciates
[01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:55.658]  uh... the work and appreciates the time and the effort and the and and all the that comes with it because i have become so despondent and so dejected over all the years of of uh... seeing things people are saying about me which are not true they're saying that i'm an enemy of so-and-so you shouldn't let them get to you they're mad but you're you're getting flack as you're over the target jordan and that people are jealous of you they try to stir up fights
[01:45:56.158 --> 01:46:03.167]  Just you need to know you've done a lot of great work, you're still doing great work, and if they know they're getting to you, they're only going to go ten times crazier.
[01:46:03.167 --> 01:46:11.176]  And look, I've got people threatening me and threatening my family, and I know it's happened to you, and you've got people banging on your doors, saying they're going to kill you and the cops won't help you.
[01:46:11.176 --> 01:46:15.542]  I understand all that's happened, that's why we've got you here, to try to get you support, but
[01:46:16.122 --> 01:46:17.303]  Don't let him get you down.
[01:46:17.303 --> 01:46:25.847]  I mean, I know you're 70-something years old and got cancer, so it's easy for me, you know, 30-something years younger to sit here and say this, but that's why we got you.
[01:46:25.847 --> 01:46:27.868]  You got rare books, important material.
[01:46:27.868 --> 01:46:30.490]  Folks, go buy his stuff at JordanMaxwell.com.
[01:46:30.490 --> 01:46:34.352]  Jordan, I've known him for many years, interviewed him many times over the years, never heard him like this.
[01:46:34.352 --> 01:46:35.453]  I know he's in a bad spot.
[01:46:35.453 --> 01:46:37.854]  That's why we are trying to support him here.
[01:46:37.854 --> 01:46:41.096]  But just from me to you, brother, don't let him get you down.
[01:46:41.096 --> 01:46:43.397]  Man, you have done an incredible job.
[01:46:43.977 --> 01:46:48.642]  Well, I'll tell you what really bothers me terrible.
[01:46:48.642 --> 01:46:54.768]  I mean, I'll just tell you personally what really hurts me is the fact that I haven't even begun to tell
[01:46:55.606 --> 01:46:57.487]  The people who want to know.
[01:46:57.487 --> 01:47:00.187]  I haven't even begun to scrape the surface of what I really am.
[01:47:00.187 --> 01:47:01.188]  I know the frustration.
[01:47:01.188 --> 01:47:02.208]  I have the same feeling.
[01:47:02.208 --> 01:47:03.769]  There's 50 films I want to make.
[01:47:03.769 --> 01:47:06.389]  There's all these complex issues I want to expose.
[01:47:06.389 --> 01:47:10.751]  And then I make a film like Endgame that cost me $150,000 to make.
[01:47:10.751 --> 01:47:13.092]  And people watched it and appreciated it.
[01:47:13.092 --> 01:47:15.052]  But I know it hasn't gotten the attention it needs.
[01:47:15.052 --> 01:47:17.433]  This is life-saving information.
[01:47:18.473 --> 01:47:21.194]  And people just kind of like, oh, you put it on the web for free?
[01:47:21.194 --> 01:47:22.754]  I don't even care to watch it.
[01:47:22.754 --> 01:47:24.534]  You know, it's like you pour your guts out.
[01:47:24.534 --> 01:47:26.475]  You don't sleep making something.
[01:47:26.475 --> 01:47:31.096]  You go through hell to make it, and they don't understand it's pearls before swine sometimes.
[01:47:31.096 --> 01:47:37.057]  Absolutely, and consequently, but the powers that be know that you're putting it out, and they're going to deal with you.
[01:47:37.057 --> 01:47:44.979]  You're going to have your family and threats against your life, and threats against your home, and you're dealing, you're fighting something on the front lines,
[01:47:45.559 --> 01:47:49.861]  Well, other people are just viewing your work as entertainment.
[01:47:49.861 --> 01:47:56.204]  So many people will listen to me and watch videos, which I've never put any of my videos... That's right!
[01:47:56.204 --> 01:48:01.687]  One of the biggest comic book companies has put out a whole line of comic books called New World Order, and they are giving you credit, Jordan.
[01:48:01.687 --> 01:48:05.989]  You know, I know that comic book company did, because I think they had to.
[01:48:05.989 --> 01:48:12.452]  Lawfully, they had to, because it was based on me, so... But, you know, if you go on my website to the...
[01:48:13.502 --> 01:48:14.643]  To the e-books.
[01:48:14.643 --> 01:48:16.824]  Those free e-books are very, very important.
[01:48:16.824 --> 01:48:18.625]  That's why I put them on the home page.
[01:48:18.625 --> 01:48:22.288]  And, of course, I have another box called Endorsements and Emails.
[01:48:22.288 --> 01:48:27.091]  A lot of interesting stuff on there that people have sent me.
[01:48:27.091 --> 01:48:28.592]  And I just put it out in the public.
[01:48:28.592 --> 01:48:31.334]  So I'll let you see what other people have sent me.
[01:48:31.334 --> 01:48:33.935]  Then Downloadable Documents.
[01:48:33.935 --> 01:48:34.956]  The Photo Gallery.
[01:48:34.956 --> 01:48:37.558]  And, of course, just general research boxes.
[01:48:37.558 --> 01:48:39.579]  I've got tons of stuff on there.
[01:48:39.579 --> 01:48:40.900]  But what really bothers me
[01:48:42.102 --> 01:48:48.337]  I would love to be able to do radio and talk to the world and tell the world what I really know.
[01:48:49.511 --> 01:48:57.475]  Well, why don't we have you back up later in the week for like two hours to really... You can say whatever you want here, Jordan.
[01:48:57.475 --> 01:48:59.075]  It's a big audience.
[01:48:59.075 --> 01:49:00.236]  Millions of people, as you know.
[01:49:00.236 --> 01:49:06.859]  But before we go to this final break for the main show, I'm going to call you back on my studio line for an internet cast.
[01:49:06.859 --> 01:49:11.041]  Millions will see it in the next few months, but tens of thousands listening and watching right now.
[01:49:11.041 --> 01:49:17.183]  I want to talk about two things before this main show ends in about eight minutes.
[01:49:17.183 --> 01:49:18.084]  And that is this.
[01:49:19.787 --> 01:49:22.609]  A, how does their command and control structure work?
[01:49:22.609 --> 01:49:27.811]  I mean, we know it's a philosophy, it's a pyramid, it's different lower levels of compartmentalization.
[01:49:27.811 --> 01:49:32.153]  A, but I mean, you know, from a city up to the national level, international.
[01:49:32.153 --> 01:49:34.214]  And then B, their master plan.
[01:49:34.214 --> 01:49:40.556]  If they're able to get everything they want built and done, which it looks like they're able to do, what will it finally look like?
[01:49:40.556 --> 01:49:44.618]  When will they go ahead and wipe out 90% of us, or what's the time frame on that?
[01:49:44.618 --> 01:49:48.480]  In fact, let's cover that first, and we're going to skip this break for InfoWars.com listeners.
[01:49:49.146 --> 01:49:51.373]  Okay, you want to talk about it now?
[01:49:51.373 --> 01:49:54.062]  Yeah, let's talk about their master plan if they win.
[01:49:55.889 --> 01:50:07.211]  Well, I think the human race, and this is going to be a painting with a very broad brush, but it's based on many years of looking at the subject from every conceivable angle.
[01:50:07.211 --> 01:50:18.594]  And I've traveled all around the world, from Egypt to Europe, to quite literally around the world, talking to people, lecturing on the subject, and I've learned so much from others.
[01:50:19.654 --> 01:50:24.038]  I'm totally convinced that the human race is being mutated according to a scientific method.
[01:50:35.999 --> 01:50:46.783]  We know that there have been experiments done as far back as the 1920s and 30s of trying to crossbreed animals with humans.
[01:50:46.783 --> 01:50:48.163]  The Germans were doing that.
[01:50:51.345 --> 01:50:54.526]  You know, I know exactly what you're thinking when it comes to this economy.
[01:50:54.526 --> 01:50:55.886]  The banks are crashing.
[01:50:55.886 --> 01:50:57.507]  The stock market's a mess.
[01:50:57.507 --> 01:50:59.167]  There's the mortgage crisis.
[01:50:59.167 --> 01:51:01.128]  There's the lending crisis.
[01:51:01.128 --> 01:51:05.789]  There is the food and gasoline prices through the ceiling crisis.
[01:51:05.789 --> 01:51:07.350]  And we are paralyzed a little bit.
[01:51:07.350 --> 01:51:09.330]  We don't know exactly how to respond to it.
[01:51:09.330 --> 01:51:10.110]  I don't know what to say.
[01:51:10.110 --> 01:51:10.911]  What can you do?
[01:51:10.911 --> 01:51:11.771]  Do what you can do.
[01:51:11.771 --> 01:51:12.391]  That's what you do.
[01:51:12.391 --> 01:51:13.511]  You do what you can do.
[01:51:13.511 --> 01:51:15.192]  What I can do is I can put some food away.
[01:51:15.572 --> 01:51:17.094]  There's a global food shortage.
[01:51:17.094 --> 01:51:17.614]  I can read it.
[01:51:17.614 --> 01:51:20.818]  I can go to efoodsdirect.com, read hundreds of articles about this.
[01:51:20.818 --> 01:51:24.262]  I can go up on the Google website and Google food shortage and see.
[01:51:24.262 --> 01:51:25.203]  The world's a mess.
[01:51:25.203 --> 01:51:25.624]  I know it.
[01:51:25.624 --> 01:51:26.044]  You know it.
[01:51:26.044 --> 01:51:26.805]  Look at the prices.
[01:51:26.805 --> 01:51:27.526]  Look where they're headed.
[01:51:27.526 --> 01:51:28.127]  Be prepared.
[01:51:28.127 --> 01:51:28.828]  Take care of yourself.
[01:51:28.828 --> 01:51:34.735]  You owe your family some security, some sense of self-being, a little bit of self-reliance is a good idea right now.
[01:51:34.915 --> 01:51:37.036]  Get some food from eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:51:37.036 --> 01:51:38.757]  Go up to eFoodsDirect.com right now.

[01:51:40.598 --> 01:51:41.418]  We canned it for you.
[01:51:41.418 --> 01:51:42.459]  That's 1-800-409-5633. eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:51:42.459 --> 01:51:42.559]  1-800-409-5633.
[01:51:42.559 --> 01:51:42.879]  Call us now.
[01:51:49.620 --> 01:51:51.721]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[01:51:51.721 --> 01:51:54.163]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:51:54.163 --> 01:51:56.424]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:51:56.424 --> 01:51:58.005]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:51:58.005 --> 01:51:59.707]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:51:59.707 --> 01:52:01.948]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:52:01.948 --> 01:52:06.431]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:52:06.431 --> 01:52:09.093]  Will you please sit down and shut up?
[01:52:11.329 --> 01:52:15.493]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:52:15.493 --> 01:52:15.973]  An inside job?
[01:52:15.973 --> 01:52:16.454]  How dare you?
[01:52:27.165 --> 01:52:32.208]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:52:32.208 --> 01:52:34.950]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:52:34.950 --> 01:52:41.435]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9- Truth Rising.

[01:52:46.518 --> 01:52:49.020]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:52:49.733 --> 01:52:52.974]  Every 22 seconds, a violent crime is committed.
[01:52:52.974 --> 01:52:55.316]  Are you concerned about your personal safety?
[01:52:55.316 --> 01:52:58.937]  Why wait for something bad to happen when you can take action now?
[01:52:58.937 --> 01:52:59.878]  Be smart.
[01:52:59.878 --> 01:53:00.838]  Be safe.

[01:53:45.231 --> 01:53:46.912]  I was a highwayman, along the coach roads I did ride.
[01:54:05.037 --> 01:54:10.642]  In my gut, in my psyche, the full power of my subconscious mind.
[01:54:10.642 --> 01:54:14.866]  Thousands of times more powerful than my limited cerebral cortex.
[01:54:14.866 --> 01:54:18.048]  In my bones, I know they're waging war against the species.
[01:54:19.629 --> 01:54:22.431]  And then lo and behold, I go to their own documents.
[01:54:22.431 --> 01:54:27.973]  They vitriolically say they're poisoning us, killing us, euthanizing us right now.
[01:54:27.973 --> 01:54:29.994]  With the nutrition we've been getting, we should be living to 130.
[01:54:29.994 --> 01:54:31.635]  They are waging war on us and I...
[01:54:34.136 --> 01:54:38.540]  You know, I hadn't even got into Jordan Maxwell's own research on this, and I say, what's the master plan?
[01:54:38.540 --> 01:55:00.758]  And he says, to dumb us down into a new suboid species, and you read the eugenicists, you read the government plans, they are now doing it, inserting us into a matrix, you're being sucked into your iPhones, sucked into your video games, you're already interfacing, you're already... I've got to have you up very soon, Jordan, to do a whole show on this, and how they admit they're doing it,
[01:55:01.218 --> 01:55:04.562]  And I've had elitists tell me, Alex, you warn them, and look, they don't even care.
[01:55:04.562 --> 01:55:06.565]  That's the ultimate cop-out.
[01:55:06.565 --> 01:55:10.730]  They have done everything for generations to dumb us down and to turn us into this.
[01:55:10.730 --> 01:55:16.277]  The National Banking Association, a hundred years ago, put out memos saying, buy up the media, dumb everybody down.
[01:55:16.277 --> 01:55:17.379]  They're reading too much.
[01:55:17.379 --> 01:55:19.601]  They're chemically attacking all of you.
[01:55:20.302 --> 01:55:28.707]  This is their own admissions, and Jordan, we're going to call you back in just a moment on your line, because we're going to end the show, the main show.
[01:55:28.707 --> 01:55:36.472]  We're going to do 30 more minutes with you, but in closing, I want to thank you for coming on the main show, and I want to ask everybody to visit JordanMaxwell.com.
[01:55:36.472 --> 01:55:38.654]  Anything else in closing you want to say to the main audience?
[01:55:38.934 --> 01:55:44.298]  Yes, the material that's on my website is there for the moment.
[01:55:44.298 --> 01:55:48.442]  So you need to understand, it may not be there tomorrow.
[01:55:48.442 --> 01:55:55.888]  So you better get whatever's on there because I'm always under attack, always my website is being cut down, shut down.
[01:55:56.528 --> 01:56:03.634]  So I'm just saying, go on my website to JordanMaxwell.com and get whatever you can now, because who knows what tomorrow's gonna bring.
[01:56:03.634 --> 01:56:07.537]  Are you for people taking the stuff and creating mirrors of it?
[01:56:07.537 --> 01:56:08.218]  Oh, I don't care.
[01:56:08.218 --> 01:56:09.699]  I couldn't care less.
[01:56:09.699 --> 01:56:16.905]  Okay, well we'll create a mirror and then point at it for you then, and then all my visitors can come check out what you're doing and get your books and videos.
[01:56:16.905 --> 01:56:24.752]  Jordan, we're gonna call you right back here in just one minute, so take a two minute break and the phone will ring, and we'll do 30 more minutes and take calls, okay?
[01:56:24.992 --> 01:56:25.652]  I don't.
[01:56:25.652 --> 01:56:26.453]  Okay, bye-bye.
[01:56:26.453 --> 01:56:26.853]  Thank you.
[01:56:26.853 --> 01:56:28.134]  There goes Jordan Maxwell.
[01:56:28.134 --> 01:56:36.479]  For Genesis listeners, our wonderful AM and FM and shortwave and all the affiliates, satellite, the show ends in three minutes, two and a half minutes.
[01:56:36.479 --> 01:56:38.981]  There's only one place to listen to the rest of Jordan Maxwell.

[01:56:41.202 --> 01:56:44.084]  That's a different internet streaming you find on the network or other places.
[01:56:44.084 --> 01:56:45.185]  That's where the show re-loops.
[01:56:45.185 --> 01:56:47.266]  When we go into overdrive, it's still live.

[01:57:06.593 --> 01:57:09.474]  An amazing interview with Jordan Maxwell.
[01:57:09.474 --> 01:57:10.935]  People kept saying, get Jordan Maxwell on.
[01:57:10.935 --> 01:57:14.416]  I tried to get him on, he said he wasn't doing interviews anymore, and then he graciously came on.
[01:57:14.416 --> 01:57:18.697]  So here he is, he's on, and he'll be on more in the next few weeks with us.
[01:57:20.700 --> 01:57:28.168]  I do want to tell all of you that Truth Rising, the people taking action, waking up to 9-11, exposing that lie, can expose the rest.

[01:58:15.540 --> 01:58:18.282]  You need these organic foods.
[01:58:18.282 --> 01:58:18.962]  It's so good.
[01:58:18.962 --> 01:58:23.084]  866-762-9238 or Interfood.com.

[01:58:24.845 --> 01:58:28.868]  I'll be back live right now with Jordan Maxwell at one place.
[01:58:28.868 --> 01:58:29.428]  Infowars.
[01:58:31.718 --> 01:58:34.339]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:34.339 --> 01:58:37.621]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:37.621 --> 01:58:43.404]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[01:58:43.404 --> 01:58:46.886]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:58:46.886 --> 01:58:49.528]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:58:49.528 --> 01:58:51.068]  But who is the enemy?
[01:58:51.068 --> 01:58:51.869]  Bin Laden.
[01:58:51.869 --> 01:58:52.689]  This is his MO.
[01:58:52.689 --> 01:58:54.230]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:58:54.230 --> 01:58:55.691]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:58:56.211 --> 01:59:03.354]  Tabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:59:03.354 --> 01:59:03.835]  Some U.S.
[01:59:03.835 --> 01:59:10.197]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:59:10.197 --> 01:59:13.659]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:59:13.919 --> 01:59:24.166]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:59:24.166 --> 01:59:25.406]  Fabled enemies.
[01:59:25.406 --> 01:59:33.132]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:59:33.132 --> 01:59:36.514]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:59:42.614 --> 01:59:45.003]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:45.003 --> 01:59:47.794]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:57.244 --> 02:00:00.146]  Aaron's got some final points he wants to make on this.
[02:00:00.146 --> 02:00:02.288]  We could spend every show, every minute on this.
[02:00:02.288 --> 02:00:03.569]  This is what governs the world.
[02:00:03.569 --> 02:00:04.871]  This is the reality.
[02:00:04.871 --> 02:00:06.712]  This is what we're dealing with.
[02:00:06.712 --> 02:00:07.853]  We're being soft-killed.
[02:00:07.853 --> 02:00:12.057]  We're being studied, poisoned, tested, mixtures of poisons.
[02:00:12.057 --> 02:00:17.241]  How to dumb us down, how to psychologically control us, how to kill us, how to get us out of the way.
[02:00:17.241 --> 02:00:22.546]  Before I go back to Aaron and then Mark Stepnowski, new vitality, aloes, colon cleanse.
[02:00:32.251 --> 02:00:37.655]  Before I go back to Aaron, I just want everybody to
[02:00:40.345 --> 02:00:43.488]  Check out Aloe's Colon and Body Cleanse.
[02:00:43.488 --> 02:00:44.549]  They are just great folks.
[02:00:44.549 --> 02:00:48.472]  Their phone number is 1-800-569-4056.
[02:00:48.472 --> 02:00:49.773]  1-800-569-4056.
[02:00:49.773 --> 02:00:54.498]  Or you can simply go to NewVitality.com.
[02:00:54.498 --> 02:00:58.661]  They have hundreds of great products, but that's just one of them that detoxifies and cleans you out.
[02:00:58.661 --> 02:01:01.364]  They also have Super Beta Prostate, a very
[02:01:01.884 --> 02:01:06.386]  Well-known, high-quality combination of herbs and things that shrink the prostate.
[02:01:06.386 --> 02:01:07.187]  Men over 45 really need this.
[02:01:07.187 --> 02:01:07.267]  1-800-569-4056.
[02:01:07.267 --> 02:01:07.347]  1-800-569-4056.
[02:01:07.347 --> 02:01:09.268]  You can also check out another one of our fine sponsors.
[02:01:09.268 --> 02:01:09.388]  Now,
[02:01:31.309 --> 02:01:32.970]  That is a Coloblue.
[02:01:32.970 --> 02:01:35.571]  And a Coloblue is a coloblue.com.
[02:01:35.571 --> 02:01:38.433]  They are an atmospheric water generator for the home.
[02:01:38.433 --> 02:01:41.295]  Pays for itself in one year if you buy your water from the store.
[02:01:41.295 --> 02:01:43.316]  Pure, clean water without the fluoride.
[02:01:43.316 --> 02:01:45.617]  Unlimited water from the humidity in the air.
[02:01:45.617 --> 02:01:48.379]  Machine produces up to 28 liters or 7 1⁄2 gallons a day.
[02:01:48.379 --> 02:01:54.182]  This is a pretty amazing system, folks, when you realize that
[02:01:55.242 --> 02:02:01.746]  You can grab it right out of the air, and it has no fluoride, none of the stuff they self-medicate you or forcibly medicate you with.
[02:02:01.746 --> 02:02:08.850]  Ecoloblue, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E-D-O-T-C-O-M, big banner up on Infowars.com, or 866-585-4044.
[02:02:08.850 --> 02:02:10.911]  By the way, they sold out of these and just got more in.
[02:02:10.911 --> 02:02:12.032]  We sold the company out.
[02:02:12.032 --> 02:02:12.652]  You did, listeners.
[02:02:12.892 --> 02:02:19.277]  866-585-4044 or 1-866-585-4044 or coloblue.com.
[02:02:19.277 --> 02:02:21.838]  Okay, Aaron, you've got about 2-3 minutes left.
[02:02:21.838 --> 02:02:23.540]  I want to go back to Aaron now.
[02:02:23.540 --> 02:02:25.501]  Aaron, finish up with your other points on eugenics.
[02:02:25.501 --> 02:02:30.405]  I was going to rapid-fire a Margaret Singer quote and then finally a Richard Dawkins quote.
[02:02:30.405 --> 02:02:34.848]  Margaret Singer, the most merciful thing a family does to one of its infant members is to kill it.
[02:02:35.348 --> 02:02:38.691]  Birth control must lead ultimately to a cleaner race.
[02:02:38.691 --> 02:02:41.013]  Eugenics sterilization is an urgent need.
[02:02:41.013 --> 02:02:44.535]  We must prevent multiplication of this bad stock.
[02:02:44.535 --> 02:02:50.220]  Eugenics is the most adequate and thorough avenue to solution of racial, political, and social problems.
[02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:56.244]  And Richard Dawkins has this kind of open thought of, uh, what if eugenics came back?
[02:02:56.244 --> 02:03:04.369]  In the 1920s and 1930s, scientists from both the political left and right would not have found the idea of designer babies particularly dangerous.
[02:03:04.369 --> 02:03:06.590]  Though, of course, they would not have used that phrase.
[02:03:06.590 --> 02:03:14.475]  Today, I suspect that the idea is too dangerous for comfortable discussion, and my conjecture is that Adolf Hitler is responsible for the change.
[02:03:14.975 --> 02:03:19.297]  Nobody wants to be caught agreeing with that monster, even in a single particular.
[02:03:19.297 --> 02:03:27.021]  The specter of Hitler has led some scientists to stray from ought to is and deny that breeding for human qualities is even possible.
[02:03:27.021 --> 02:03:35.526]  But if you can breed cattle for milk, horses for speed, dogs for skill, why shouldn't you breed humans for mathematical, musical, or athletic ability?
[02:03:35.526 --> 02:03:37.667]  I wonder some 60 years after Hitler's death,
[02:03:38.425 --> 02:03:44.050]  Why we might at least venture to ask what the moral difference is between breeding for musical ability.
[02:03:44.050 --> 02:03:48.954]  And the problem is with breeding, you're talking about exterminating most of the puppies or kittens that are born.
[02:03:48.954 --> 02:03:51.216]  You're talking about the state having this incredible control.
[02:03:51.216 --> 02:04:01.905]  And in special breeds, you get more mental illness, more inherited diseases, and the elites that are bred, most of their children are born retarded or had serious mental illness problems.
[02:04:02.145 --> 02:04:04.486]  But do they give up this system of control?
[02:04:04.486 --> 02:04:15.468]  No, they've only intensified it down throughout the last hundred plus years, and now they're practicing their eugenics upon us through the vaccines, through the chemtrails, through the entire system.
[02:04:15.468 --> 02:04:24.570]  Aaron, I want to have you back up in a couple weeks again for a whole other discussion and other areas of eugenics, because this is the governing system, the ideology of the New World Order.
[02:04:24.570 --> 02:04:29.671]  We've got a special guest coming up after the break, a lot of key videos and things from what happened in Denver,
[02:04:30.171 --> 02:04:33.696]  With the MSNBC staff attacking us is going up on YouTube later.
[02:04:33.696 --> 02:04:35.658]  That'll be up on InfoWars.com.
[02:04:35.658 --> 02:04:40.584]  The Rage Against the Machine concert being attacked by police, that's going up on InfoWars.com.

[02:05:46.872 --> 02:05:49.754]  Listener, ask yourself, can I be deceived?
[02:05:49.754 --> 02:05:54.155]  Matthew 24 states four times, in the last days many will be deceived.
[02:05:54.155 --> 02:05:57.717]  There are many ideas about the mark of the beast and the Antichrist.
[02:05:57.717 --> 02:06:01.478]  What do you know about the beast, its mark, and the Antichrist?
[02:06:01.478 --> 02:06:05.420]  Is the beast a superpower nation or a giant computer in Belgium?
[02:06:05.420 --> 02:06:07.601]  Is its mark an implanted chip, a tattoo,
[02:06:07.921 --> 02:06:13.664]  The National ID Card, or 666, is the Antichrist a person, title, or both?
[02:06:13.664 --> 02:06:15.585]  Some believe these things are in the future.
[02:06:15.585 --> 02:06:17.566]  Others believe that it's in the past.
[02:06:17.566 --> 02:06:20.868]  1 John states, The Antichrist is already in the world.
[02:06:20.868 --> 02:06:23.009]  What is the truth, and what is a lie?
[02:06:23.009 --> 02:06:25.350]  Are you willing to search God's Word for the truth?
[02:06:25.350 --> 02:06:27.371]  Friends, these answers are in the Bible.

[02:06:48.743 --> 02:06:50.884]  We live in a world of vanishing privacy.
[02:06:50.884 --> 02:06:58.729]  The added threat of invisible radio waves sending out personal information to anyone willing to receive them makes our privacy as citizens even less secure.
[02:06:58.729 --> 02:07:02.472]  The RFID tags and ID cards have been proven to be not secure.
[02:07:02.472 --> 02:07:06.654]  Thieves are able to read information stored on these tags to steal your identity.
[02:07:06.654 --> 02:07:11.958]  Protect yourself from ID theft with our RFID blocker, available as a wallet or passport case.

[02:07:20.486 --> 02:07:21.647]  Why take a chance?
[02:07:21.647 --> 02:07:23.669]  This is your personal information.
[02:07:23.669 --> 02:07:24.650]  Protect yourself.

[02:07:56.842 --> 02:07:58.402]  You want answers?
[02:07:58.402 --> 02:07:59.323]  Well, so does he.
[02:07:59.323 --> 02:08:04.164]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:04.164 --> 02:08:08.206]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:09.711 --> 02:08:15.196]  Well, we've got one of the most famous linemen in NFL history, Mark Stepnoski, on with us.
[02:08:15.196 --> 02:08:16.317]  Pro career in the NFL.
[02:08:16.317 --> 02:08:20.341]  Most of us have been with the Dallas Cowboys and the Houston Oilers.
[02:08:20.341 --> 02:08:24.404]  He won two Super Bowls, one with the Cowboys and was a five-time Pro Bowler.
[02:08:25.625 --> 02:08:27.547]  And he is a 9-11 truther.
[02:08:27.547 --> 02:08:29.829]  We had him on almost a year ago.
[02:08:29.829 --> 02:08:31.270]  It was a long time ago.
[02:08:31.270 --> 02:08:32.391]  Time just flies by.
[02:08:32.391 --> 02:08:33.392]  It seems like yesterday.
[02:08:33.392 --> 02:08:39.837]  And he also campaigns for the legalization of marijuana, the decriminalization.
[02:08:39.837 --> 02:08:42.379]  You got 80 plus percent of drug users only use marijuana.
[02:08:42.819 --> 02:08:54.811]  They need to keep it that way, so that, uh, they need to keep it illegal so they can SWAT Team Raid more people and fill more prisons while the government has been caught hundreds of times shipping in heroin and cocaine and laundering the money.
[02:08:54.811 --> 02:08:58.935]  Did you know it's legal for foreign drug money to be invested in the New York Stock Exchange?
[02:08:58.935 --> 02:09:06.162]  And the former head, Richard Grasso, when he was head of the New York Stock Exchange, was in Reuters going to the FARC, communist guerrillas, and saying, invest your cocaine money with us.
[02:09:06.722 --> 02:09:10.645]  I'm going off on a rant here about the decriminalization of marijuana.
[02:09:10.645 --> 02:09:17.369]  They need to keep it illegal because, what is it, 86-87% of people only smoke marijuana that use illegal drugs.
[02:09:17.369 --> 02:09:19.931]  George Washington smoked it.
[02:09:19.931 --> 02:09:22.432]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, this is an excuse.
[02:09:22.432 --> 02:09:23.293]  What's a greater crime?
[02:09:23.293 --> 02:09:26.495]  Guys in black masks squat-teaming you at 3am?
[02:09:26.495 --> 02:09:28.396]  Or somebody smoking marijuana?
[02:09:28.396 --> 02:09:31.999]  You know, do we want this great evil in the name of stopping this minor evil?
[02:09:32.779 --> 02:09:34.421]  And I'm not a marijuana person.
[02:09:34.421 --> 02:09:38.264]  I've smoked marijuana, and it's just not my cup of tea.
[02:09:38.264 --> 02:09:43.269]  But I know a lot of people that do smoke it, a lot of doctors and lawyers and people, and they don't need to be SWAT teamed.
[02:09:43.269 --> 02:09:47.232]  Mark Stepnoski, I really appreciate you coming on with us today.
[02:09:47.232 --> 02:09:47.933]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:09:47.933 --> 02:09:49.134]  It's good to be on with you today.
[02:09:49.565 --> 02:09:51.146]  You're going to be with us for the next 50 minutes.
[02:09:51.146 --> 02:09:55.268]  At the bottom of the hour, we're going to open the phones up at 1-800-259-99231.
[02:09:55.268 --> 02:10:00.350]  The last 10 months or so since you were on with us, a lot has happened.
[02:10:00.350 --> 02:10:08.174]  Top Italian former presidents, German defense ministers, Japanese diet members, the best actress.
[02:10:08.174 --> 02:10:11.695]  So many prominent people have gone public for 9-11 Truth.
[02:10:11.695 --> 02:10:15.217]  Give us your take on the evolution of it and why 9-11 Truth is so important.
[02:10:15.217 --> 02:10:16.998]  Why you took the step of speaking out, Mark.
[02:10:17.927 --> 02:10:28.072]  Yeah, I think it's great to see, you know, like you said, as time goes on, more and more people are coming forward as they gradually become aware of the facts.
[02:10:28.072 --> 02:10:37.856]  Obviously, you know, through online research and through the amount of books and magazines that have come out now, you know, enough authors have come forward and stated their opinion.
[02:10:37.856 --> 02:10:39.817]  And I think what's really important now is
[02:10:40.990 --> 02:10:50.241]  You know, obviously, people early on, shortly after the 9-11 attacks, were kind of pigeon-holed as conspiracy theorists.
[02:10:50.241 --> 02:10:56.469]  But now, that label, it never did apply, but it's less applicable now than ever.
[02:10:57.169 --> 02:11:05.216]  Simply because the people who are coming out in favor of 9-11 Truth are too credible to ignore.
[02:11:05.216 --> 02:11:17.446]  You know, in the last few years we've had the formation of things like Scholars for 9-11 Truth, which includes architects and engineers for 9-11 Truth, pilots for 9-11 Truth.
[02:11:17.446 --> 02:11:26.433]  We have former people who worked in government, including the current administration, who are coming out and saying that they don't believe the official story.
[02:11:27.330 --> 02:11:42.924]  So it's just a case of, you know, as more people become exposed to it, as the media blackouts and mainstream media continues, mostly via the internet, people are becoming connected and becoming aware of these facts and voicing their opinion.
[02:11:42.924 --> 02:11:44.586]  It's very encouraging to see.
[02:11:44.586 --> 02:11:46.828]  You know, it's never too late.
[02:11:47.498 --> 02:11:58.943]  For anybody who feels strongly about this issue to come forward and voice their opinion because I think as time goes on people will be surprised to find out that
[02:11:59.893 --> 02:12:15.005]  If they are no longer worried about expressing their skepticism of the official story regarding 9-11, they will find out that there are a lot of people out there, you might refer to them as a silent majority, who also feel very much the same way.
[02:12:15.005 --> 02:12:24.112]  They are either too afraid or too reluctant to come forward and also express their doubts in the official story.
[02:12:24.112 --> 02:12:25.593]  What made you go public?
[02:12:25.593 --> 02:12:28.876]  I mean, you were one of the first prominent
[02:12:29.376 --> 02:12:29.596]  I just, uh...
[02:12:45.592 --> 02:12:54.560]  You know, I got tired of waiting for the channels of government to move along in a proper fashion.
[02:12:54.560 --> 02:12:58.463]  You know, like a lot of people, I had hope.
[02:12:58.463 --> 02:13:06.270]  It turned out to be false hope, in retrospect, but I had hope at the time that maybe the 9-11 Commission would be legitimate.
[02:13:09.116 --> 02:13:12.799]  You know, the safeguards are in place in constitutional government.
[02:13:12.799 --> 02:13:17.802]  I thought that they would kick in and operate in the manner in which they're supposed to.
[02:13:17.802 --> 02:13:24.466]  And we would see a proper investigation, you know, with relevant witnesses and
[02:13:26.033 --> 02:13:27.434]  Evidence.
[02:13:27.434 --> 02:13:31.517]  And, as we all know, none of that really came to fruition.
[02:13:31.517 --> 02:13:34.158]  The 9-11 Commission was a sham.
[02:13:34.158 --> 02:13:35.279]  It was a cover-up.
[02:13:35.279 --> 02:13:45.785]  It was a modern-day version of the Warren Commission, as far as its attempt to silence witnesses and suppress truth-tellers.
[02:13:45.785 --> 02:13:54.311]  And, you know, when things reached that point, and that commission was shown to be the impotent vehicle that it was,
[02:13:55.319 --> 02:14:02.242]  I just felt compelled to, in my own small way, say whatever I could as far as what I thought the truth was.
[02:14:02.242 --> 02:14:05.624]  Well, Mark, that isn't in your own small way.
[02:14:05.624 --> 02:14:10.186]  It's not just that you're a celebrity or a well-known sports figure.
[02:14:10.186 --> 02:14:19.350]  It's that people resonate with the courage of a Willie Nelson or a Mark Stepnowski or a former German defense minister or a former governor.
[02:14:19.350 --> 02:14:20.291]  They resonate
[02:14:20.991 --> 02:14:23.514]  And they know that person has a lot to lose.
[02:14:23.514 --> 02:14:24.916]  That person is going to be demonized.
[02:14:24.916 --> 02:14:27.419]  This person is really stepping up.
[02:14:27.419 --> 02:14:31.685]  And so that's what makes you and so many others that have stood up and gone public heroes.
[02:14:31.685 --> 02:14:33.587]  But look at the vindication.
[02:14:33.587 --> 02:14:34.649]  The Chicago Tribune
[02:14:35.290 --> 02:14:41.415]  Four months ago, reported as well as Associated Press, the NSA declassified that Israel did attack the U.S.'
[02:14:41.355 --> 02:14:47.299]  's liberty to try to sink it, to blame it on Egypt to start World War III, as they've now tried, the U.S.
[02:14:47.299 --> 02:14:49.301]  has tried in Georgia.
[02:14:49.301 --> 02:14:58.728]  It's now come out, Cy Hirsch at a big media event, and he did admit in New Yorker Magazine that Cheney, he just said a staged provocation, he said this is the provocation to have U.S.
[02:15:00.189 --> 02:15:05.392]  Navy SEALs dressed up like Iranians on blue PT boats attack U.S.
[02:15:05.392 --> 02:15:07.813]  ships in the Strait of Hormuz.
[02:15:07.813 --> 02:15:17.898]  So, government-sponsored terror, the fact the Gulf of Tonkin was staged, that's all coming out now, and people say, well, that was seven years ago, you know, 9-11, why are you so concerned?
[02:15:17.898 --> 02:15:28.483]  Well, because Black Ops is going to continue to stage terror attacks as a pretext for control if we don't step up and expose that they're behind it.
[02:15:28.483 --> 02:15:29.584]  Mark your comments on that.
[02:15:30.774 --> 02:15:33.037]  Yeah, I entirely agree.
[02:15:33.037 --> 02:15:35.139]  It's been a steady progression.
[02:15:35.139 --> 02:15:38.223]  It's been, you know, just one instant after another.
[02:15:38.223 --> 02:15:39.624]  We saw last year where
[02:15:40.976 --> 02:15:45.240]  Bush and Tony Blair had the plan to send U.S.
[02:15:45.240 --> 02:15:48.683]  military planes over Iran, disguised as U.N.
[02:15:48.683 --> 02:15:56.570]  planes, to try and instigate an attack on them so we would be justified in responding.
[02:15:56.570 --> 02:16:08.300]  I remember also last year, there was a big Nebrzynski appearing in the press, practically coming right out and saying, you know, we had to worry about the current administration
[02:16:09.645 --> 02:16:14.450]  Putting together a false flag terror op to stimulate war with Iran.
[02:16:14.450 --> 02:16:20.376]  This is a guy who is now Barack Obama's main foreign policy advisor.
[02:16:20.376 --> 02:16:31.808]  So again, we have these people coming out in mainstream media within the last year with these scenarios that have come and gone that have involved false flag terror.
[02:16:32.791 --> 02:16:38.214]  So I just think in this day and age, people are becoming a little bit too hip to what's going on.
[02:16:38.214 --> 02:16:40.155]  They understand ahead of time.
[02:16:40.155 --> 02:16:44.978]  Similar to what happened in Spain when you had the false flag terror attack there with the train.
[02:16:44.978 --> 02:16:48.700]  The people within days came out in the hundreds of thousands and said, we know you did it.
[02:16:48.700 --> 02:16:51.542]  And it turned out it was the intelligence operation.
[02:16:51.542 --> 02:16:52.222]  Exactly.
[02:16:52.222 --> 02:16:55.484]  Hopefully we are reaching that point now in North America.
[02:16:55.484 --> 02:16:58.506]  If you call it critical mass or whatever you want to.
[02:16:59.778 --> 02:17:09.044]  Hopefully through, you know, the work that you do and statements made by 9-11 truthers like myself and the many others around the world.
[02:17:09.044 --> 02:17:17.290]  You know, we have people, a politician in Japanese Parliament came out wanting to have another investigation.
[02:17:17.290 --> 02:17:28.197]  We're having a march in Canada to Ottawa to culminate on September 11th where they're going to present a petition at Parliament Hill for a new 9-11 investigation in Canada.
[02:17:30.679 --> 02:17:40.685]  So I think, you know, worldwide you are seeing people come around and, you know, waking up to the fact that this was a false flag operation, you know, to have a certain effect on the American public.
[02:17:40.685 --> 02:17:57.036]  The question now is, you know, are the people who live in America going to be smart enough to look into the right sources of information to kind of emancipate themselves from this from this media blackout that's going on?
[02:17:57.036 --> 02:17:59.358]  I think if people, you know, continue to
[02:18:00.365 --> 02:18:18.695]  Turn off their TVs, give less credence to mainstream media, corporate media, and instead, you know, read online, read books, read magazines, anything out there that's going to give the true story of 9-11 truth.
[02:18:18.695 --> 02:18:25.579]  This is what's going to mobilize the population in America so that when another false flag terrorist attack occurs,
[02:18:26.704 --> 02:18:39.252]  Whatever it is, whether it's bioterror, whether it's a mini-nuke somewhere, people will see it for what it is, and not be railroaded into a certain mindset like they were after 9-11.
[02:18:46.305 --> 02:19:02.592]  He's a pro bowler and he's, again, going public, not because it's fun, but because it's his duty, and I would venture to say because he just said it, he knows that if we don't expose the tool of false flag, that mechanism, this military-industrial complex is going to keep doing it to hurt us.
[02:19:02.592 --> 02:19:05.033]  Just like in England, how they hunt pheasants.
[02:19:05.033 --> 02:19:12.136]  They beat pots and pans, they have beaters who push the birds out in a wedge so the hunters can shoot them when they get driven out.
[02:19:12.136 --> 02:19:12.877]  It's the same thing.
[02:19:12.877 --> 02:19:15.718]  You want to attack Iran, you want to attack Iraq, you stage an event.
[02:19:16.238 --> 02:19:17.258]  You want to attack Egypt?
[02:19:17.258 --> 02:19:18.379]  You stage an event.
[02:19:18.379 --> 02:19:25.002]  They've been caught over and over and they're going to continue to do this if we don't expose it.
[02:19:25.002 --> 02:19:36.106]  And that's why the courage of now thousands of prominent people that have gone public for 9-11 truth and now all these architects and engineers and physicists is unstoppable.
[02:19:36.106 --> 02:19:42.468]  We're going to come back and talk about the fraudulent new NIST report with Mark Stepnoski and then we're going to take your phone calls.
[02:19:42.468 --> 02:19:42.949]  Stay with us.
[02:19:42.949 --> 02:19:43.529]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:47.193 --> 02:19:47.994]  Gold.
[02:19:47.994 --> 02:19:49.514]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:19:49.514 --> 02:19:55.818]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:19:55.818 --> 02:19:59.981]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:19:59.981 --> 02:20:01.922]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:20:01.922 --> 02:20:04.343]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:20:04.343 --> 02:20:10.947]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaned
[02:20:10.947 --> 02:20:11.407]  We're good to go.
[02:20:37.005 --> 02:20:37.966]  800-686-2237.
[02:20:37.966 --> 02:20:42.247]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.

[02:20:43.907 --> 02:20:50.009]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[02:20:50.009 --> 02:20:53.470]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:20:53.470 --> 02:20:56.130]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:20:56.130 --> 02:20:57.671]  But who is the enemy?
[02:20:57.671 --> 02:20:58.171]  Bin Laden.
[02:20:58.171 --> 02:20:59.351]  This is his ammo.
[02:20:59.351 --> 02:21:00.832]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:21:00.832 --> 02:21:02.312]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:21:02.812 --> 02:21:09.979]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:21:09.979 --> 02:21:10.460]  Some U.S.
[02:21:10.460 --> 02:21:16.806]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:21:16.806 --> 02:21:20.249]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:21:20.509 --> 02:21:30.777]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:21:30.777 --> 02:21:32.018]  Fabled enemies.

[02:22:46.865 --> 02:22:47.706]  Question.
[02:22:47.706 --> 02:22:52.429]  Is the world getting better or vastly worse?
[02:22:52.429 --> 02:22:55.312]  A world economic collapse could come age.
[02:22:56.877 --> 02:22:57.738]  Question.
[02:22:57.738 --> 02:22:59.279]  Are you prepared?
[02:22:59.279 --> 02:23:03.002]  Or are you ignoring the signs?
[02:23:03.002 --> 02:23:03.783]  Question.
[02:23:03.783 --> 02:23:11.049]  Do you have 7 years of healthy food for your family?

[02:24:01.792 --> 02:24:04.498]  Two-time Super Bowl champion with the Dallas Cowboys.
[02:24:04.498 --> 02:24:05.439]  Also played with the Oilers.
[02:24:05.439 --> 02:24:07.283]  Five-time Pro Bowler.
[02:24:07.283 --> 02:24:08.947]  Mark Stepnoski on the line.
[02:24:08.947 --> 02:24:11.933]  I remember sitting around watching the Cowboys play.
[02:24:12.964 --> 02:24:18.348]  Rooting for Mark, and now I'm rooting for him in a much more important way, and that is his courage.
[02:24:18.348 --> 02:24:24.752]  Speaking out for 9-11 Truth, there's a ballot initiative in New York to get a new investigation going, or expose that, a grand jury.
[02:24:24.752 --> 02:24:26.933]  There's a lot of different initiatives.
[02:24:26.933 --> 02:24:33.778]  There's marches going on, events coming up in New York next week that I hope folks go to.
[02:24:33.778 --> 02:24:38.341]  Let's talk about that ballot initiative first, and then I want to get into the NIS report, Mark.
[02:24:39.511 --> 02:24:48.091]  Yeah, obviously, since we're coming up on the anniversary of 9-11, there's a lot of activities going around to highlight the fact that the official story is untrue.
[02:24:50.020 --> 02:24:51.100]  It is in New York City.
[02:24:51.100 --> 02:24:53.821]  It's a 9-11 ballot initiative.
[02:24:53.821 --> 02:25:02.423]  This is a way for, I mean, it's obvious that, like I said earlier, that we're not going to get a proper investigation through government channels.
[02:25:02.423 --> 02:25:12.826]  But this is a way for the people of New York City to create a new 9-11 commission, an investigation of the events, which would have subpoena power.
[02:25:12.826 --> 02:25:14.547]  It would have some legal authority.
[02:25:16.525 --> 02:25:20.388]  Volunteers in New York City have been going around getting signatures on petitions.
[02:25:20.388 --> 02:25:24.351]  They needed a minimum of $30,000, which they just recently achieved.
[02:25:24.351 --> 02:25:25.893]  So that was great news.
[02:25:25.893 --> 02:25:32.738]  And now these petitions will be submitted to the New York City Clerk and New York City Council.
[02:25:32.738 --> 02:25:42.906]  And with a sufficient amount of signatures, this being above $30,000, they will be able to present this and then it can become
[02:25:44.398 --> 02:25:44.978]  Absolutely, and
[02:26:14.656 --> 02:26:15.716]  It shouldn't just be New York.
[02:26:15.716 --> 02:26:24.259]  We need lots of grand jury, you know, type public investigations, both governmental and non-governmental, to draw this out publicly and continue to expose it.
[02:26:24.259 --> 02:26:33.843]  Everything is a step, to use a football analogy, you know, for more yards to get a new set of downs towards the touchdown, bringing these criminals to justice.
[02:26:33.843 --> 02:26:37.104]  And even if we never bring them to quote justice by sending them to prison,
[02:26:37.882 --> 02:26:48.230]  By publicly convicting them in the court of public opinion, and by educating the public about false flag terrorism, it breaks that tool that the black ops continue to use.
[02:26:48.230 --> 02:26:50.552]  Mark, your take on that?
[02:26:50.552 --> 02:26:54.915]  Yeah, without a doubt, it's all a question of, you know, just mobilizing the masses.
[02:26:54.915 --> 02:26:59.779]  I think a lot of people fall into a defeatist attitude of, you know, what can I do?
[02:26:59.779 --> 02:27:01.560]  How can I make a difference?
[02:27:01.560 --> 02:27:02.641]  I'm only one person.
[02:27:03.723 --> 02:27:13.189]  Well, just by signing that petition, just by signing your name on that piece of paper, you are, in effect, saying, look, I don't believe in what the government is telling me.
[02:27:13.189 --> 02:27:17.151]  I don't believe the lies that I'm being told in corporate media.
[02:27:17.151 --> 02:27:20.073]  You know, I demand a new investigation.
[02:27:20.073 --> 02:27:23.855]  This is one way for people to have their voice heard, people who otherwise
[02:27:24.535 --> 02:27:26.517]  Might feel powerless.
[02:27:26.517 --> 02:27:28.418]  There's a lot of people in New York City.
[02:27:28.418 --> 02:27:33.082]  If a lot of them mobilize, it might be surprising what could actually happen.
[02:27:33.082 --> 02:27:42.150]  But, you know, I urge listeners of your show who either live in New York City or have family or friends there to let them know about this.
[02:27:42.150 --> 02:27:52.698]  They can look it up on www.nyc911initiative.org and find out anything they would like to about this movement.
[02:27:52.698 --> 02:27:53.639]  But I think that
[02:27:54.682 --> 02:28:00.645]  Yeah, right now it's moving along very nicely, and should it succeed in any degree, it'll be a big step forward.
[02:28:00.645 --> 02:28:02.246]  It really could be a breakthrough.
[02:28:02.246 --> 02:28:07.488]  And a lot of people have this loser mentality of, oh, it'll never be corruption, oh, there's no point.
[02:28:07.488 --> 02:28:09.529]  Ladies and gentlemen, we don't have a choice, number one.
[02:28:09.529 --> 02:28:11.270]  Number two, we're actually having an effect.
[02:28:11.770 --> 02:28:14.831]  The majority of Americans in major polls believe there's a 9-11 cover-up.
[02:28:14.831 --> 02:28:16.332]  There's hundreds of these polls.
[02:28:16.332 --> 02:28:17.632]  We're having an effect.
[02:28:17.632 --> 02:28:25.295]  Look how far we've come from myself two months before the attack saying I think they're going to attack the World Trade Center and blame it on their asset bin Laden.
[02:28:25.295 --> 02:28:28.156]  Because I saw them preparing the public, introducing bin Laden.
[02:28:28.156 --> 02:28:29.516]  I knew their past history.
[02:28:29.516 --> 02:28:36.199]  I knew the FBI had cooked the bomb, framed the driver, given them the detonators, blocked local police in 93 with the first attack.
[02:28:37.239 --> 02:28:40.681]  I mean, again, look how far we've come from 9-11 that first day.
[02:28:40.681 --> 02:28:48.966]  Look how far we've come, thanks to people like Mark Sipnosky, Willie Nelson, Governor Ventura, Stephen Jones.
[02:28:48.966 --> 02:28:58.992]  Now, I'm going to skip this break for InfoWars.com, for everybody else, we'll be back in three minutes, but I don't want to waste any time that we've got with Mark Sipnosky today, but Mark, that NIST report,
[02:28:59.784 --> 02:29:01.165]  They delayed it three years.
[02:29:01.165 --> 02:29:05.607]  The people on the government NIST board are involved in explosive thermite research.
[02:29:05.607 --> 02:29:06.708]  They're experts.
[02:29:06.708 --> 02:29:08.769]  They're involved in government contracts.
[02:29:08.769 --> 02:29:12.271]  And then they had to pull back.
[02:29:12.271 --> 02:29:18.675]  They had to say, okay, our last five reasons for the towers falling and Building 7 falling are wrong.
[02:29:18.675 --> 02:29:19.976]  It's not fuel oil tank.
[02:29:19.976 --> 02:29:22.217]  It's not bad building construction.
[02:29:22.217 --> 02:29:23.298]  It's not fires.
[02:29:23.298 --> 02:29:23.638]  It's not
[02:29:24.238 --> 02:29:25.238]  No, no.
[02:29:25.238 --> 02:29:29.699]  They gave a new reason, a new syndrome, a new phenomenon.
[02:29:29.699 --> 02:29:32.160]  We're going to cover that right now with Mark Stepnowski.
[02:29:32.160 --> 02:29:37.481]  Stay with us.
[02:29:37.481 --> 02:29:38.882]  We're on the march.
[02:29:38.882 --> 02:29:41.402]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:41.402 --> 02:29:44.103]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:47.745 --> 02:29:53.471]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[02:29:53.471 --> 02:29:54.712]  And we knew what to do.
[02:29:55.523 --> 02:29:56.783]  Or at least we thought we did.
[02:29:56.783 --> 02:30:03.825]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[02:30:03.825 --> 02:30:12.708]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[02:30:12.708 --> 02:30:19.510]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[02:30:19.810 --> 02:30:22.972]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[02:30:22.972 --> 02:30:26.875]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was BOOM!
[02:30:26.875 --> 02:30:27.175]  BOOM!
[02:30:27.175 --> 02:30:27.496]  BOOM!
[02:30:27.496 --> 02:30:27.816]  BOOM!
[02:30:27.816 --> 02:30:28.756]  BOOM!
[02:30:28.756 --> 02:30:31.839]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[02:30:31.839 --> 02:30:37.883]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[02:30:37.883 --> 02:30:40.805]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[02:30:40.805 --> 02:30:45.749]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[02:30:47.062 --> 02:30:50.464]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[02:30:50.464 --> 02:30:52.786]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[02:30:52.786 --> 02:30:56.088]  Tonight, I have a date with the very lovely Rachel.
[02:30:56.088 --> 02:31:02.973]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[02:31:02.973 --> 02:31:05.075]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[02:31:05.575 --> 02:31:08.876]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[02:31:08.876 --> 02:31:13.657]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[02:31:13.657 --> 02:31:17.578]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[02:31:17.578 --> 02:31:19.218]  Travel less, meet online.

[02:31:46.874 --> 02:31:56.140]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[02:31:56.140 --> 02:32:04.306]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[02:32:04.306 --> 02:32:08.909]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[02:32:08.909 --> 02:32:11.671]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[02:32:11.671 --> 02:32:15.654]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning and high cholesterol.
[02:32:15.834 --> 02:32:23.217]  Naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.

[02:32:44.225 --> 02:33:06.435]  We're bringing up the NIST report and how they've had to change how physics works and so a lot of scientists and physicists and architects that weren't involved and didn't believe it was an inside job are now looking, going,
[02:33:07.392 --> 02:33:11.995]  You're saying jet fuel made 2600 degree pockets of stuff five weeks later?
[02:33:11.995 --> 02:33:13.216]  Thousands of degrees hotter?
[02:33:13.216 --> 02:33:21.260]  I mean, this is... I mean, NIST coming out and saying now small fires bring down steel buildings is changing everything.
[02:33:21.260 --> 02:33:22.101]  Uh, Mark, continue.
[02:33:23.345 --> 02:33:31.287]  Yeah, I mean, this coincides with the Bush administration's technique from day one.
[02:33:31.287 --> 02:33:39.128]  They have actively sought to discredit science and to really argue with scientific belief.
[02:33:39.128 --> 02:33:50.591]  You know, it doesn't matter whether it's the EPA, the FDA, whatever it is, you know, there's been active warfare on the part of the Bush administration against science.
[02:33:51.417 --> 02:33:54.498]  And this is another clear-cut example of that.
[02:33:54.498 --> 02:33:55.658]  Well, it's like marijuana.
[02:33:55.658 --> 02:33:57.639]  They know marijuana doesn't kill one person a year.
[02:33:57.639 --> 02:34:08.302]  It's a miracle drug with thousands of patented real things it does for cancer, glaucoma, but they're still SWAT teaming people every day where I live looking for marijuana.
[02:34:08.302 --> 02:34:09.083]  Absolutely.
[02:34:09.083 --> 02:34:10.163]  No matter how much
[02:34:11.187 --> 02:34:24.653]  Evidence you present, no matter how authoritative that evidence is, no matter who it comes from, as far as, you know, credible scientific or medical establishments, it will just be written off by propaganda.
[02:34:24.653 --> 02:34:26.314]  You know, it really isn't in full war.
[02:34:26.314 --> 02:34:39.000]  You can present any kind of factual evidence you want to support your theory, but again, you know, corporate media, the Republican or Democratic Party, they'll just write it off with propaganda.
[02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:40.701]  But that is starting... I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:34:41.903 --> 02:34:54.910]  I'm sorry, but that is what we are seeing right now, which is another by this NIST report trying to come out and explain why something that's never happened before did happen, namely three steel buildings collapsing because of fire in one day.
[02:34:54.910 --> 02:34:57.852]  They do have to stretch the realms of reality.
[02:34:57.852 --> 02:35:06.877]  You know, they do have to contradict science and offer an alternative view, which is completely bogus, which is why I'm glad to see that people with
[02:35:08.314 --> 02:35:09.374]  People who are experts.
[02:35:09.374 --> 02:35:19.018]  People, you know, whose backgrounds are in this field are coming forward and saying, look, you guys are just straining any credibility you have here to the breaking point.
[02:35:19.018 --> 02:35:20.378]  We can't accept this.
[02:35:20.378 --> 02:35:26.980]  The only thing is, you know, these are things that's coming out in scientific journals and academic papers.
[02:35:26.980 --> 02:35:27.861]  They're peer-reviewed.
[02:35:27.861 --> 02:35:32.022]  These are not things that appear on the evening news or are going to be on a front page headline.
[02:35:32.022 --> 02:35:33.723]  You know, that's a great point.
[02:35:33.723 --> 02:35:34.623]  First, they said
[02:35:35.905 --> 02:35:38.707]  Like, three or four years ago, oh, let's see some studies.
[02:35:38.707 --> 02:35:39.587]  And then they did studies.
[02:35:39.587 --> 02:35:40.668]  Let's see them be peer-reviewed.
[02:35:40.668 --> 02:35:50.134]  Then a couple of them get peer-reviewed by major, major peer-reviewed, I mean, not just side journals, big marquee, you know, Super Bowl-level journals.
[02:35:50.134 --> 02:35:51.214]  We're talking the big ones.
[02:35:51.214 --> 02:35:53.035]  You know, the most prestigious.
[02:35:53.035 --> 02:35:54.877]  And then they try to write that off.
[02:35:54.877 --> 02:36:00.380]  I mean, we keep clearing every hurdle, Mark, and the other side is just looking stupider and stupider.
[02:36:01.494 --> 02:36:06.696]  And I believe that NIST itself is part of the executive branch, correct?
[02:36:06.696 --> 02:36:08.016]  Yes, yes.
[02:36:08.016 --> 02:36:27.403]  So there we see another example, you know, just like the Office of National Drug Control Policy is part of the executive branch, and they are the ones who constantly spew forth misinformation about the drug war, we have NIST, which is also an executive branch administration, you know, leading the charge about the lies regarding 9-11.
[02:36:29.375 --> 02:36:33.678]  Well, like you said, though, more and more people are tuning out of mainstream media.
[02:36:33.678 --> 02:36:45.385]  It's exponential, and instead of them reporting some of the truth or trying to act more credible, it seems like they're getting more shrill, more cartoonish, more ridiculous, piling lie on top of lie.
[02:36:45.385 --> 02:36:48.307]  I don't know what the tactic is there, but it doesn't seem to be working, Mark.
[02:36:49.241 --> 02:36:56.104]  Well, it reminds me of the old quote about, and I can't remember who said it, but it's just the old quote about truth coming out, you know.
[02:36:56.104 --> 02:37:07.189]  First, when you are a truth teller, you know, in this age of universal deceit that we live in, where those of us are trying to commit a revolutionary act by telling the truth,
[02:37:07.958 --> 02:37:13.061]  You know, it becomes evident that we will be attacked.
[02:37:13.061 --> 02:37:16.123]  That's the first method.
[02:37:16.123 --> 02:37:21.726]  Actually, the first method is to be written off and ridiculed, and that was the case early on after September 11th.
[02:37:21.726 --> 02:37:26.689]  We were all pigeonholed as conspiracy terrorists, and we were out of our minds, so that was the ridicule.
[02:37:26.689 --> 02:37:30.432]  Then you had the vicious attacks, and now it's becoming obvious that
[02:37:31.354 --> 02:37:36.196]  You know, the 9-11 truth movement is based on truth and facts and evidence.
[02:37:36.196 --> 02:37:40.038]  We are being maliciously attacked.
[02:37:40.038 --> 02:37:49.202]  Yes, and that's... You know, I just want to follow up by, again, with that famous quotation, the third stage of the truth being accepted is that people will accept it.
[02:37:49.202 --> 02:37:51.203]  So I think now we are in the second stage.
[02:37:51.203 --> 02:37:54.504]  You know, those first few years we were attacked and vilified.
[02:37:54.504 --> 02:37:56.685]  I'm sorry, we were ridiculed.
[02:37:56.685 --> 02:37:58.566]  Now we are being attacked and vilified.
[02:37:59.426 --> 02:38:15.380]  Hopefully we are coming close to that third stage where there will be mass acceptance of this truth and people won't be afraid to put aside their cognitive dissonance and step out and accept this new paradigm of reality that we all have to see around us.
[02:38:15.860 --> 02:38:16.900]  Oh, beautifully put.
[02:38:16.900 --> 02:38:18.001]  And that's really it.
[02:38:18.001 --> 02:38:33.147]  I don't blame a lot of people who don't want to look at the facts, because every night when I go to bed, I look at how innocent my children are, I look at how good my wife is, and I just think, God, there are really evil people in this world, and they really are in control, and I've really gotten their face, and man, I've been threatened, and this is dangerous.
[02:38:33.647 --> 02:38:36.710]  Then I realize, you know, I just can't let the world go on like this.
[02:38:36.710 --> 02:38:39.573]  I've got to do my job, whether it has an effect or not.
[02:38:39.573 --> 02:38:44.978]  But the truth is, when good people do get involved, I believe as Thomas Jefferson said, you know, that we can't overturn evil.
[02:38:44.978 --> 02:38:48.782]  It's evil only wins when good men and women do nothing.
[02:38:49.542 --> 02:39:02.287]  And you're right, first they ignore you, then they attack you, then you win, and that's basically what's happening now, and there's another quote I'm butchering, but paraphrasing, but you know, truth goes through three stages.
[02:39:02.287 --> 02:39:08.970]  First it's laughed at, then it's ridiculed, then it's accepted as universally true.
[02:39:08.970 --> 02:39:13.932]  And people who said the world was round were laughed at, and now we know it's round, Mark.
[02:39:13.932 --> 02:39:15.893]  Well yeah, and just for me personally,
[02:39:17.102 --> 02:39:19.663]  You know, again, I think we should all just do what we can.
[02:39:19.663 --> 02:39:26.567]  You know, different people have different amounts of time, different resources, be they financial or whatever.
[02:39:26.567 --> 02:39:31.370]  But I just felt personally, as an American citizen, it was my duty to speak out.
[02:39:31.370 --> 02:39:37.573]  You know, I was asked to do a newspaper article for my hometown.
[02:39:38.465 --> 02:39:41.547]  And it was just one of those deals, uh, where are they now?
[02:39:41.547 --> 02:39:43.988]  What are they doing now that they're retired?
[02:39:43.988 --> 02:39:50.752]  And I just, again, I felt compelled to at least let people in Erie, Pennsylvania, my hometown, who read the paper
[02:39:51.696 --> 02:40:02.566]  No, that somebody who came from there doesn't believe in the official story of 9-11 and wholeheartedly believes that they too should seek out the truth for themselves.
[02:40:02.566 --> 02:40:11.674]  What type of response, I mean I know overwhelmingly it was positive, but what type of negative responses did you get and then what was it like with your moral courage to go through that and not recant?
[02:40:13.834 --> 02:40:17.176]  Well, you know, the reaction overwhelmingly was positive.
[02:40:17.176 --> 02:40:24.900]  I mean, I don't spend a lot of time in my hometown anymore, and I know that there were people who wrote in letters saying, you know, what's wrong with this guy?
[02:40:24.900 --> 02:40:26.541]  He's way out in that field.
[02:40:27.222 --> 02:40:40.246]  But like we discussed earlier, and now that we are, you know, coming up on eight years after the fact, people are coming, I'm sorry, seven years after the fact, people are becoming aware of what actually happened that day.
[02:40:40.246 --> 02:40:44.527]  You know, the initial shock value of that psychological operation is wearing off.
[02:40:44.527 --> 02:40:48.248]  People are getting a chance to see what really went on behind the scenes.
[02:40:48.248 --> 02:40:52.909]  So I didn't really suffer much fallout at all.
[02:40:52.909 --> 02:40:53.930]  You know, it was just, again,
[02:40:55.487 --> 02:41:01.051]  Regardless of how many people might write in, there's always going to be a few, you know, who will just personally attack you.
[02:41:01.051 --> 02:41:04.294]  I experienced the same thing when I spoke out against marijuana laws.
[02:41:04.294 --> 02:41:11.980]  You know, you have people saying that you're not a good role model, you know, that you're a proponent of drug use and everything else.
[02:41:11.980 --> 02:41:22.788]  Yeah, but you go to a football game and there's liquor ads everywhere, which no doubt is bad for you, but then, you know, these guys with a whiskey bottle, how dare you be with that marijuana?
[02:41:23.759 --> 02:41:31.482]  Yeah, again, people have blinders on with certain respect to the war on drugs, just like they do with 9-11.
[02:41:31.482 --> 02:41:46.068]  So I just wanted to, again, for people in my hometown who might know who I am or what I stand for, at least they might know enough about me to know that I'm not just some guy spouting off, that I might be a guy who actually does have educated opinions.
[02:41:46.750 --> 02:41:51.016]  And it might be worthwhile to follow up on what I said, because they might learn something.
[02:41:51.016 --> 02:41:51.577]  Absolutely.
[02:41:51.577 --> 02:41:53.760]  Let's take some calls from Mark Stepnoski.
[02:41:53.760 --> 02:41:58.367]  Mark, before we do that in the last 15 or 16 minutes, any other points you wanted to add?
[02:41:58.367 --> 02:41:59.789]  Anything else you wanted to point out?
[02:42:00.794 --> 02:42:07.661]  Well, I would just like to tell people that they should make a personal commitment in their life to continue to educate themselves on these issues.
[02:42:07.661 --> 02:42:15.648]  You know, the easiest thing in the world is just to pigeonhole something and write it off, put a label on it, and say, I don't have to look into it any further.
[02:42:15.648 --> 02:42:20.593]  You know, they'll just categorize it as something they don't want to know, and then just move on.
[02:42:20.593 --> 02:42:22.014]  That's the easiest thing to do.
[02:42:22.014 --> 02:42:24.697]  And I say, intellectually, that's a lazy thing to do.
[02:42:25.377 --> 02:42:28.579]  I think people should take it upon themselves to have the initiative.
[02:42:28.579 --> 02:42:35.223]  If you're going to disprove something, if you're going to write it off, at least look into it and have an educated opinion about it.
[02:42:35.223 --> 02:42:41.507]  So I just, I know there's a lot of nonsense out there regarding any topic, including 9-11.
[02:42:43.788 --> 02:42:44.269]  Go ahead.
[02:42:44.269 --> 02:42:48.270]  I would just, you know, tell people to look into anything they can.
[02:42:48.270 --> 02:42:58.895]  Like some of the things I mentioned earlier, scholars from 9-11 Truth, any 9-11 Truth chapter, you know, cities all over North America have their own separate 9-11 Truth factor.
[02:42:58.895 --> 02:43:07.479]  We have a great one here in Toronto, British, or Vancouver, British Columbia, as well as Toronto and Ottawa, across Canada, just like in the States.
[02:43:08.039 --> 02:43:10.041]  I need to send you Truth Rising.
[02:43:10.041 --> 02:43:14.847]  We've got Canadian, U.S., 9-11, Truth, We Are Change just exploding.
[02:43:14.847 --> 02:43:16.769]  That new film just came out.
[02:43:16.769 --> 02:43:17.970]  I know you've seen Terror Storm.
[02:43:17.970 --> 02:43:18.811]  What did you think of that film?
[02:43:19.793 --> 02:43:21.573]  I thought it was outstanding.
[02:43:21.573 --> 02:43:23.714]  There are a lot of great movies out right now.
[02:43:23.714 --> 02:43:34.436]  There's a current one people can watch on YouTube called Shadowplay, which is an excellent synopsis of the 9-11 false flag terror attack.
[02:43:34.436 --> 02:43:39.458]  It's a film that's coming out in segments, and they can watch those on YouTube.
[02:43:39.458 --> 02:43:45.139]  That's an excellent education for anybody who wants to kind of get a crash course on this subject.
[02:43:45.399 --> 02:43:49.047]  Well, and remember folks, the evil people that did this are still there.
[02:43:49.047 --> 02:43:50.811]  And I wish they were in a cave.
[02:43:50.811 --> 02:43:53.357]  That's a lot less scary than knowing they're in control of our government.
[02:43:55.555 --> 02:43:56.616]  No question about it.
[02:43:56.616 --> 02:44:05.141]  I mean, we see now in a Dutch newspaper talk of an attack on Iran as imminent.
[02:44:05.141 --> 02:44:12.445]  I'm so glad to see that you're at the Democratic National Convention, because people seem to think that if we get a Democrat in office, there's going to be big changes.
[02:44:12.445 --> 02:44:17.968]  But the Democratic Congress has already signed off on a preemptive nuclear attack against Iran.
[02:44:18.639 --> 02:44:19.059]  Absolutely.
[02:44:19.059 --> 02:44:25.824]  I don't know how anybody can expect anything to the contrary, should Democrats be in power.
[02:44:25.824 --> 02:44:28.085]  Yeah, and again, we're not bashing either party, folks.
[02:44:28.085 --> 02:44:37.892]  The point is, is that the corporates have taken over everything, and until we recognize that both parties have been taken over, we can never set about fixing the real problem if we're in that controlled paradigm.
[02:44:37.892 --> 02:44:46.318]  Again, five-time Pro Bowler, two-time Super Bowl champion, Mark Stepnoski is our guest, former Dallas Cowboy, Houston Oiler.
[02:44:46.318 --> 02:44:47.538]  Let's go ahead and talk to
[02:44:48.719 --> 02:44:54.020]  Tim in New York, then we'll go to Adam, Tim, Casey, Victor, and others.
[02:44:54.020 --> 02:44:56.041]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Tim in New York.
[02:44:56.041 --> 02:44:59.402]  Hi Alex and Mark, give you a lot of credit for what you're doing.
[02:44:59.402 --> 02:45:07.444]  I'm involved in a situation here now where I'm experiencing my friend and girlfriend of 12 years is being soft killed as we speak.
[02:45:08.104 --> 02:45:10.867]  She has a brother that's in the State Department.
[02:45:10.867 --> 02:45:13.670]  She gave him a copy of the Road to Tyranny in about 2002.
[02:45:13.670 --> 02:45:18.535]  And ever since then, their family's really been against us.
[02:45:18.535 --> 02:45:21.498]  She was an experimental guinea pig back in 1958.
[02:45:21.498 --> 02:45:23.720]  We had her thymus radiated.
[02:45:23.720 --> 02:45:28.305]  She's always had lifelong allergies and actually a victim of sexual abuse when she was a child.
[02:45:28.305 --> 02:45:30.147]  Her mother brought foster kids into the house.
[02:45:30.888 --> 02:45:39.074]  On July of this year she finally found out that she had a lot of thyroid problems and a lot of hormone deficiencies causing some memory problems.
[02:45:39.074 --> 02:45:46.159]  About a month later her brother came home from where he works in the State Department, coerced her into going to lunch with her.
[02:45:46.159 --> 02:45:47.140]  She never came home.
[02:45:47.140 --> 02:45:49.262]  What he did is told her he was going to get her to a doctor.
[02:45:49.682 --> 02:45:57.587]  The next day he put her into the psychiatric ward up at Strong Memorial, and since then... Well, sir, you need to put the names, the emails, the facts.
[02:45:57.587 --> 02:46:00.548]  I need to confirm this happened, I believe you, but I need to confirm it.
[02:46:00.548 --> 02:46:02.810]  That's the big news, so let me stop you.
[02:46:02.810 --> 02:46:09.914]  So because she was a 9-11 truther, she's been stuck in a mental ward, and we're starting to see this happen like the old Soviet Union.
[02:46:09.914 --> 02:46:16.278]  I'm gonna get your name and number off air, and then we'll have you on as a guest so I can see some documents and confirm this.
[02:46:16.698 --> 02:46:30.644]  But we have seen calls, it's in the new film Truth Rising, all the major cable channels saying, kill Alex Jones, put them in FEMA camps, they're terrorists, Taser 9-11 truthers, send them to Gitmo, and they're serious.
[02:46:30.644 --> 02:46:34.385]  Mark Sipnosky, I mean, they're getting scared of us now.
[02:46:34.385 --> 02:46:35.566]  Yeah, no question.
[02:46:35.566 --> 02:46:37.747]  You'll see it across the board.
[02:46:37.747 --> 02:46:42.489]  Yeah, whether it's Geraldo Rivera or Bill Maher or any of these guys who
[02:46:43.658 --> 02:46:57.089]  You are in a position where they have a show on corporate media and the only way they're going to continue to maintain their show is to spout the lies of the current administration, you know, the corporate party line.
[02:46:57.089 --> 02:46:59.351]  Calling for violence against us is what blows me away.
[02:47:00.771 --> 02:47:10.394]  Yeah, well, again, you know, it's, uh... I think Sinclair Lewis said, when fascism comes to America, it'll be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross.
[02:47:10.394 --> 02:47:12.315]  Yep, that's what Ron Paul said and got in trouble.
[02:47:12.315 --> 02:47:13.995]  He's not saying Christians are bad.
[02:47:13.995 --> 02:47:16.676]  He's saying evil people will use that.
[02:47:16.676 --> 02:47:21.138]  Yeah, I mean, if that's not what we're seeing right now, I don't know what we're seeing.
[02:47:21.138 --> 02:47:27.040]  Because, you know, we are looking at, again, the corporate ownership of both political parties.
[02:47:28.633 --> 02:47:31.116]  Again, you're wrapped in a flag carrying a cross.
[02:47:31.116 --> 02:47:33.178]  That's it, Adam.
[02:47:33.178 --> 02:47:42.787]  In defense of religion and freedom, they are trying to ramrod a whole system of laws through that is to the detriment of everybody.
[02:47:42.787 --> 02:47:45.169]  You got it, and it has nothing to do with Christianity.
[02:47:45.169 --> 02:47:47.872]  Adam in Texas, you're on the air with Mark Stipnoski, go ahead.
[02:47:47.872 --> 02:47:50.414]  Hey Mark, it's great to talk to you.
[02:47:51.767 --> 02:47:55.256]  I watched you through your career and some of the finest football I've ever seen.
[02:47:55.256 --> 02:47:58.223]  I was wondering if you caught Alex up there.
[02:47:59.420 --> 02:48:06.942]  Behind the MSNBC counter, and I wonder if you've met anybody more tenacious and more wonderful than Alex Jones.
[02:48:06.942 --> 02:48:07.803]  Oh, come on.
[02:48:07.803 --> 02:48:10.243]  Sounds like a setup call.
[02:48:10.243 --> 02:48:11.724]  It's not.
[02:48:11.724 --> 02:48:19.827]  I did see the clip online where T-Boom Pickens was being interviewed on MSNBC in the background.
[02:48:19.827 --> 02:48:22.027]  That was Minneapolis 9-11 Truth.
[02:48:22.027 --> 02:48:24.048]  We took over for three hours at the DNC.
[02:48:25.664 --> 02:48:27.004]  I think that's outstanding.
[02:48:27.004 --> 02:48:42.907]  I think, again, like we saw with Geraldo Rivera and like we saw with Bill Maher, there's going to have to continue, and we are change people who do it everywhere, there has to continue to be a breakthrough into mainstream media of 9-11 truth.
[02:48:42.907 --> 02:48:48.728]  Again, it's become obvious that we're not going to have a top-down solution to this problem.
[02:48:48.728 --> 02:48:51.189]  You know, the censorship is coming from top-down.
[02:48:51.189 --> 02:48:52.069]  It's going to be bottom-up.
[02:48:52.749 --> 02:48:53.390]  Exactly.
[02:48:53.390 --> 02:48:57.992]  It's going to have to be grassroots, and that's the beauty of the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[02:48:57.992 --> 02:49:01.014]  You know, people, it's a grassroots movement.
[02:49:01.014 --> 02:49:08.718]  People don't have to rely on anything else other than their fellow citizens who want to get to the bottom of this and find out the truth.
[02:49:08.718 --> 02:49:09.459]  Well, exactly.
[02:49:09.459 --> 02:49:10.720]  I have to use the football analogy.
[02:49:10.720 --> 02:49:11.300]  What's it called?
[02:49:11.300 --> 02:49:12.401]  What's the term?
[02:49:12.401 --> 02:49:13.481]  I'll dip my tongue.
[02:49:13.481 --> 02:49:20.906]  Where the ball is moved by running, you know, just a foot at a time, a long battle down the whole field?
[02:49:20.906 --> 02:49:21.126]  Yes.
[02:49:22.381 --> 02:49:24.482]  Yeah, uh, time of possession.
[02:49:24.482 --> 02:49:30.823]  Yeah, like, uh... Yeah, like, uh, you're gonna ground out, you're gonna grind, uh, eat up the clock.
[02:49:30.823 --> 02:49:32.464]  Yeah, uh... Ground war, whatever.
[02:49:32.464 --> 02:49:33.524]  Time of possession.
[02:49:33.524 --> 02:49:34.204]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:49:34.204 --> 02:49:35.265]  I mean, I mean, that's what this is.
[02:49:35.265 --> 02:49:37.165]  And we've gone, like, 80 yards.
[02:49:37.165 --> 02:49:38.385]  We've got 20 more to go.
[02:49:38.385 --> 02:49:39.646]  We got a first down.
[02:49:39.646 --> 02:49:41.546]  We've had all these victories.
[02:49:41.546 --> 02:49:42.847]  I mean, folks, we're winning.
[02:49:42.847 --> 02:49:43.887]  We can win this thing.
[02:49:45.453 --> 02:49:50.837]  Yeah, I think really people should, again, just concentrate on what they themselves can do.
[02:49:50.837 --> 02:49:52.479]  Don't feel powerless.
[02:49:52.479 --> 02:49:58.564]  Don't think like, you know, you have to accept these things, even though you don't believe them.
[02:49:58.564 --> 02:50:03.728]  Every person has it in themselves to make a decision to do what is right.
[02:50:04.540 --> 02:50:05.120]  Absolutely.
[02:50:05.120 --> 02:50:05.961]  Let's take another call.
[02:50:05.961 --> 02:50:07.222]  I'm going to skip this break too.
[02:50:07.222 --> 02:50:12.085]  Just skip the music as well for the InfoWars.com listeners and stations that choose to carry it.
[02:50:12.085 --> 02:50:13.586]  I'm skipping the break.
[02:50:13.586 --> 02:50:17.789]  Let's go ahead and talk to... Who's up next?
[02:50:17.789 --> 02:50:18.969]  Tim in North Carolina.
[02:50:18.969 --> 02:50:22.071]  You're on the air with Mark Stepnoski.
[02:50:22.071 --> 02:50:22.712]  Hey guys.
[02:50:22.712 --> 02:50:23.692]  That's interesting.
[02:50:23.692 --> 02:50:26.794]  You came up with the football analogy there, Alex.
[02:50:26.794 --> 02:50:28.235]  That's exactly what I was thinking about.
[02:50:28.235 --> 02:50:29.216]  Mark, did you play defense?
[02:50:29.216 --> 02:50:30.937]  I played center.
[02:50:34.983 --> 02:50:36.186]  He played center.
[02:50:36.186 --> 02:50:37.989]  He was offensive lineman.
[02:50:37.989 --> 02:50:39.272]  Offensive lineman?
[02:50:39.272 --> 02:50:46.547]  Well, what I was thinking was, if you're playing defense, and that's what the 9-11 thing is all about, we're defending ourselves against those guys.
[02:50:47.304 --> 02:50:49.825]  Collectors, outdoor enthusiasts, survivalists.
[02:50:49.825 --> 02:50:53.566]  The Army-Navy store from your memory as a child is just that, a memory.
[02:50:53.566 --> 02:50:58.107]  But there is still one place to find everything from gas masks to ammo cans and find it cheap.

[02:51:47.472 --> 02:51:54.219]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:51:54.219 --> 02:51:56.862]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:51:56.862 --> 02:51:58.404]  But who is the enemy?
[02:51:58.404 --> 02:51:58.965]  Bin Laden.
[02:51:58.965 --> 02:52:00.066]  This is his ammo.
[02:52:00.066 --> 02:52:01.587]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:52:01.587 --> 02:52:03.029]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:52:03.549 --> 02:52:10.714]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:52:10.714 --> 02:52:11.194]  Some U.S.
[02:52:11.194 --> 02:52:17.538]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:52:17.538 --> 02:52:21.000]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:52:21.260 --> 02:52:31.508]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:52:31.508 --> 02:52:32.749]  Fabled enemies.

[02:52:47.520 --> 02:52:50.623]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:52:50.623 --> 02:52:56.148]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:52:56.148 --> 02:53:01.873]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:53:01.873 --> 02:53:03.355]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:53:03.355 --> 02:53:12.363]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[02:53:12.643 --> 02:53:14.504]  Now, compare Calbin Pure Soap.

[02:54:07.750 --> 02:54:12.613]  Final segment with Mark Stavnoski.
[02:54:12.613 --> 02:54:19.378]  Mark, do you have a personal website or is there a site you want to plug or something you want to say here at the end?
[02:54:19.378 --> 02:54:22.520]  Well, again, I would just, you know, for those of
[02:54:23.763 --> 02:54:33.550]  Those of us in Canada, I would just like again to bring up the march that the 9-11 Truth Society of Vancouver has orchestrated.
[02:54:33.550 --> 02:54:34.591]  It's already began.
[02:54:34.591 --> 02:54:38.834]  It's going to culminate in Ottawa on September 15th, I believe today.
[02:54:38.834 --> 02:54:42.117]  They're in Sudbury and Toronto, Ontario.
[02:54:42.117 --> 02:54:47.220]  These 9-11 truthers have been traveling across the country to get petitions.
[02:54:47.220 --> 02:54:49.582]  They're going to march from Montreal to Ottawa.
[02:54:51.275 --> 02:55:00.904]  And arrive on September 11th with all the signatures that they get nationwide on this petition, and this is for a new 9-11 investigation in Canada.
[02:55:00.904 --> 02:55:09.913]  Because what people forget is 9-11 was, it was obviously portrayed as an attack against America, but it was a worldwide crime.
[02:55:09.913 --> 02:55:14.718]  There were citizens, I believe, from over 80 countries in the World Trade Center.
[02:55:14.838 --> 02:55:20.400]  And it totally freaks out the global controllers when we're out marching, when we don't shut up, when we don't stop.
[02:55:20.400 --> 02:55:21.640]  They tell us we don't have power.
[02:55:21.640 --> 02:55:23.381]  We know that's a lie.
[02:55:23.381 --> 02:55:26.021]  An enemy will always tell you you don't have a chance to win, folks.
[02:55:26.021 --> 02:55:27.402]  That's psychological warfare.
[02:55:27.402 --> 02:55:29.162]  We don't just have a chance.
[02:55:29.162 --> 02:55:30.063]  We are going to win.
[02:55:30.063 --> 02:55:31.463]  We are never going to stop.
[02:55:31.463 --> 02:55:32.543]  A couple final calls.
[02:55:32.543 --> 02:55:33.884]  Victor in Canada.
[02:55:33.884 --> 02:55:36.024]  Speaking of Canada, you're on the air with Mark Stepnoski.
[02:55:36.024 --> 02:55:37.325]  Go ahead.
[02:55:37.325 --> 02:55:38.205]  Hi there.
[02:55:38.205 --> 02:55:40.786]  Thanks, Mark, for everything you're doing, including plugging the March on Ottawa.
[02:55:40.786 --> 02:55:41.726]  I'm actually from Ottawa.
[02:55:42.545 --> 02:55:44.185]  I have a comment and a question.
[02:55:44.185 --> 02:55:50.226]  First, my question is, what advice do you have for closet celebrity truthers?
[02:55:50.226 --> 02:55:56.687]  I would tell them just to, instead of having a fear of the unknown, just come forward and speak the truth.
[02:55:56.687 --> 02:55:58.548]  Speak from your heart.
[02:55:58.548 --> 02:56:00.848]  You know, be honest with people.
[02:56:00.848 --> 02:56:03.549]  Have facts to back up your point of view.
[02:56:03.549 --> 02:56:07.009]  And I really think that being the case, there's nothing for people to fear.
[02:56:07.009 --> 02:56:10.170]  Hey, think about Charlie Sheen, especially with his baggage.
[02:56:10.170 --> 02:56:11.370]  He was the first.
[02:56:12.034 --> 02:56:14.276]  Think about what he did.
[02:56:14.276 --> 02:56:16.639]  People appreciate someone who's willing to come forward.
[02:56:16.639 --> 02:56:23.085]  I think as time goes on, people are realizing how sanitized and censored mainstream media is.
[02:56:23.085 --> 02:56:34.117]  And whether somebody is a 9-11 truther who tells the truth, or a politician who's willing to give up the talking points and just, you know, speak truthfully, people appreciate that because it's so rare.
[02:56:34.537 --> 02:56:35.978]  Absolutely.
[02:56:35.978 --> 02:56:36.919]  Absolutely.
[02:56:36.919 --> 02:56:42.862]  That's what matters in this world is conviction and honor and duty and goodness and Mark Sipnoski and many others have got it.
[02:56:42.862 --> 02:56:48.165]  I just love to be part of this brotherhood, this sisterhood of man, of people that stand up and have courage.
[02:56:48.165 --> 02:56:49.866]  Real fast, Norman in North Carolina.
[02:56:49.866 --> 02:56:50.847]  You've got about 30 seconds.
[02:56:52.912 --> 02:56:53.792]  Hello, gentlemen.
[02:56:53.792 --> 02:56:57.973]  Thank you for taking my call, and thank you for keeping the truth sacred.
[02:56:57.973 --> 02:57:05.536]  I believe that if the truth can be told so as to be understood, that it will be believed, and that's what you do so well, Alex, and I'm proud.
[02:57:05.536 --> 02:57:17.059]  I'm a proud info warrior working to wake up anyone with a pulse and an attention span, and it just gives me a true sense of purpose and a real feeling of patriotism, and I intuit that we have critical mass.
[02:57:17.466 --> 02:57:22.987]  And given that the news report is laughable, it's just a matter of time before we have resolutions.
[02:57:22.987 --> 02:57:24.988]  God bless you guys and thank you so much.
[02:57:24.988 --> 02:57:25.488]  Absolutely.
[02:57:25.488 --> 02:57:26.808]  Let me be clear here at the end.
[02:57:26.808 --> 02:57:28.669]  We reached critical mass years ago.
[02:57:28.669 --> 02:57:32.309]  In every major poll, the majority believe that there's a cover-up.
[02:57:32.309 --> 02:57:35.190]  A huge portion of that majority believe inside job.
[02:57:35.190 --> 02:57:37.230]  And those are in polls when they're calling somebody up.
[02:57:37.230 --> 02:57:39.311]  And folks usually don't answer controversially.
[02:57:39.969 --> 02:57:41.450]  We've reached critical mass.
[02:57:41.450 --> 02:57:44.813]  People just don't realize that the majority of us know the truth and we're scared.
[02:57:44.813 --> 02:57:50.698]  People like Mark Stepnowski stepping up to the plate, that lets people see the courage and lets them know that we're not alone.
[02:57:50.698 --> 02:57:52.300]  In fact, that we're the majority.
[02:57:52.300 --> 02:57:55.342]  And so now we've just got to take back control of our government.
[02:57:55.342 --> 02:57:56.563]  We are the majority.
[02:57:56.563 --> 02:57:59.066]  Mark Stepnowski, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:57:59.066 --> 02:58:02.789]  I want to say bye to you on the show ends here in about 30 seconds, but anything else you want to add?
[02:58:03.940 --> 02:58:06.362]  Well, I just want to say it's been nice being with you.
[02:58:06.362 --> 02:58:08.303]  Thanks again for the opportunity to come on.
[02:58:08.303 --> 02:58:09.644]  I appreciate it.
[02:58:09.644 --> 02:58:10.404]  I appreciate you.
[02:58:10.404 --> 02:58:11.905]  Stay right there, my friend, for 20 seconds.
[02:58:11.905 --> 02:58:15.808]  I'm gonna be right there at the end to talk to you for a second, say bye to you personally.

[02:58:50.791 --> 02:58:54.632]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[02:58:54.972 --> 02:59:01.854]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[02:59:01.854 --> 02:59:05.254]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.

[02:59:31.426 --> 02:59:40.112]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[02:59:40.112 --> 02:59:42.494]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:42.494 --> 02:59:45.276]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:59:52.649 --> 02:59:54.411]  Government cover-ups.
[02:59:54.411 --> 02:59:55.972]  You want answers?
[02:59:55.972 --> 02:59:57.553]  Well, so does he.
[02:59:57.553 --> 03:00:01.737]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:01.737 --> 03:00:07.061]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:07.061 --> 03:00:21.272]  Well, he testified before the House Judiciary Committee on a preliminary hearing on whether they should hear full hearings, evidence on moves to impeach George W. Bush.
[03:00:21.272 --> 03:00:21.973]  The President
[03:00:24.358 --> 03:00:27.879]  And I wanted to have him on today to talk about that and go over his evidence.
[03:00:27.879 --> 03:00:39.984]  He is, of course, needs no introduction, best-selling author, the prosecutor that successfully nailed the Manson family to the wall and a bunch of other famous cases, a great legal mind, and the jury's in.
[03:00:39.984 --> 03:00:47.267]  People believe, even they had Bob Barr and others up there, that he was the most effective and most powerful in the hearing last week.
[03:00:47.267 --> 03:00:48.127]  We're going to get into that
[03:00:48.877 --> 03:00:50.338]  But he just now heard about this.
[03:00:50.338 --> 03:00:58.341]  He's so focused on trying to prosecute Bush and trying to get impeachment or some type of grand jury to move for indictment that he wasn't aware of this.
[03:00:58.341 --> 03:01:00.721]  And I don't blame him.
[03:01:00.721 --> 03:01:01.822]  This broke yesterday.
[03:01:02.782 --> 03:01:07.763]  On ThinkProgress, there's no doubt I made phone calls last night and this morning.
[03:01:07.763 --> 03:01:18.307]  Cy Hirsch, Seymour Hirsch of the New Yorker magazine, highly respected, White House sources, Congressional sources, probably the greatest living investigative journalist who broke five years ago that U.S.
[03:01:18.307 --> 03:01:26.589]  Special Forces were in Iran with Wahhabist Al Qaeda-type groups attacking the Iranian Shiite government as a pretext to overthrow it or start a war.
[03:01:27.873 --> 03:01:32.737]  He broke, along with the Times of London the same day, the story about the White House memo.
[03:01:32.737 --> 03:01:36.319]  He broke this two years ago, or a year and a half ago, the plan to fly U.S.
[03:01:36.319 --> 03:01:38.241]  airplanes painted up like U.N.
[03:01:38.241 --> 03:01:42.784]  law to try to get Saddam's forces to shoot at them or shoot them down.
[03:01:42.784 --> 03:01:45.166]  But now, major breaking news!
[03:01:46.693 --> 03:02:08.087]  Major breaking news, and so I want to read a little bit of a report after the break to him and play a few minutes of Cy Hirsch talking, and then pooh-poohing, saying, well, they just planned, you know, he just proposed, Cheney in a meeting, getting SEALs to have a bunch of arms and have a clash with destroyers and have them shoot at each other and some people could die, but you know, that's the high school annex.
[03:02:08.087 --> 03:02:12.189]  So we kind of pooh-poohed it, and I find this to be really disgusting in a way.
[03:02:12.189 --> 03:02:14.611]  Uh, Vincent Bugliosi, I hate to, you know,
[03:02:15.606 --> 03:02:21.151]  Bushwacky here with new info, but I'm going to cover the sources for you after the break, but what do you think about this?
[03:02:21.151 --> 03:02:22.972]  Well, I'd have to hear it.
[03:02:22.972 --> 03:02:38.846]  I'm so focused on getting George Bush in an American courtroom being prosecuted for murder and taking the nation to war in Iraq on a lie that I literally, other than reading headlines, do not have time to read the daily newspapers, so I'm being exposed to this for the first time, but I'd like to hear it.
[03:02:38.846 --> 03:02:39.106]  Okay.
[03:02:39.106 --> 03:02:40.367]  I'd like to hear the tape of it.
[03:02:40.367 --> 03:02:41.008]  Absolutely.
[03:02:41.008 --> 03:02:42.029]  We're going to do that.
[03:02:42.029 --> 03:02:42.729]  I'll tell you what, John,
[03:02:44.444 --> 03:02:57.590]  Move that to 2 minutes 20 seconds in when when when her starts talking on the stage that is the best place to Start this and we and we're gonna go to break and some stations join us after the break So that's that's good.
[03:02:57.590 --> 03:03:08.895]  We'll have all our full audience then But just now let me give you the background Cheney neocons are killing Americans and pretext to attack Iran think progress and other publications in the video here tape of the campus of
[03:03:09.568 --> 03:03:10.149]  We're good to go.
[03:03:20.788 --> 03:03:28.273]  Kick off World War Four as they finally call their pet project to take out the Muslims and foment a contrived clash of civilizations.
[03:03:28.273 --> 03:03:32.136]  Now, I went and checked the conference website at the university.
[03:03:32.136 --> 03:03:32.897]  He was there.
[03:03:32.897 --> 03:03:33.517]  It is him.
[03:03:33.517 --> 03:03:36.960]  It's video of him on the stage.
[03:03:36.960 --> 03:03:38.000]  We have called the New Yorker.
[03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:38.941]  We've called his office.
[03:03:38.941 --> 03:03:47.367]  We're trying to get a response because he has a responsibility to tell us the other eleven provocations they were planning.
[03:03:47.367 --> 03:03:49.769]  Okay, and it's also come out that right after
[03:03:51.101 --> 03:03:58.907]  This meeting was right after they had the event, where they claimed that the PT Iranian boats in the Strait of Hormuz came out and wanted to attack the ship.
[03:03:58.907 --> 03:04:02.069]  Turned out they were over a mile away, and there was a fake radio transmission.
[03:04:02.069 --> 03:04:04.011]  The media had to admit it was fake.
[03:04:04.011 --> 03:04:12.758]  It was obviously an Anglo with a ridiculous fake Muslim voice going, Eastern voice, Persian voice going, we are going to blow you up in one minute.
[03:04:12.758 --> 03:04:16.921]  And then it turned out, quote, oh, somebody was joking around on the Navy radios.
[03:04:16.921 --> 03:04:18.202]  Okay, yeah, that's a cover story.
[03:04:19.485 --> 03:04:21.686]  Vincent Bugliosi, we're very honored to have you.
[03:04:21.686 --> 03:04:25.409]  I didn't mean to spend four minutes doing that before we have you speak.
[03:04:25.409 --> 03:04:27.470]  I just want to give you as much info.
[03:04:27.470 --> 03:04:36.776]  We'll go to a three-minute break and come directly back with the full clip for Vincent Bugliosi so he can give us his take on it.
[03:04:36.776 --> 03:04:38.357]  Just unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:04:38.357 --> 03:04:40.159]  Vincent Bugliosi is our guest.
[03:04:40.159 --> 03:04:40.579]  Stay with us.
[03:04:45.353 --> 03:04:52.118]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:04:52.118 --> 03:04:54.760]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:04:54.760 --> 03:04:56.301]  But who is the enemy?
[03:04:56.301 --> 03:04:57.101]  Bin Laden.
[03:04:57.101 --> 03:04:58.062]  This is his ammo.
[03:04:58.062 --> 03:04:59.483]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:04:59.483 --> 03:05:00.964]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:05:01.365 --> 03:05:08.614]  Enabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:05:08.614 --> 03:05:09.094]  Some U.S.
[03:05:09.094 --> 03:05:15.442]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:05:15.442 --> 03:05:18.907]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:05:19.147 --> 03:05:29.410]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[03:05:29.410 --> 03:05:30.650]  Fabled enemies.

[03:07:46.275 --> 03:07:52.920]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:07:52.920 --> 03:07:55.903]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:02.492 --> 03:08:11.836]  During the break, because we already played it last hour, I played the audio, part of the audio, of the full video that's up on InfoWars.com right now.
[03:08:11.836 --> 03:08:23.040]  And again, you hear Cyrus talk about, he's written a little article that mentioned they wanted provocations, but not what they were, and that the New Yorker editors said, oh, well, that's not newsworthy that they were discussing this.
[03:08:23.040 --> 03:08:26.321]  I mean, that's like saying President Bush and Dick Cheney were discussing
[03:08:27.597 --> 03:08:32.559]  Kidnapping children, or cutting babies out of women's wombs, like Charlie Manson.
[03:08:32.559 --> 03:08:39.523]  But they didn't do it, so we're not going to talk about it when they clearly have staged other provocations.
[03:08:39.523 --> 03:08:53.009]  This is just incredible, and I know Vincent Bugliosi, famous prosecutor, who did prosecute the Manson family, hence the mention of Charlie Manson, doesn't like to get into things he hasn't fully vetted or looked at yet, but I played him the audio during the break.
[03:08:53.009 --> 03:08:54.510]  Give us your preliminary take on that.
[03:08:55.521 --> 03:08:57.963]  Yeah, Alex, I didn't hear everything.
[03:08:57.963 --> 03:08:59.644]  It wasn't that clear.
[03:08:59.644 --> 03:09:02.065]  I can tell you this, that it didn't surprise me at all.
[03:09:02.065 --> 03:09:04.047]  These people are capable of anything.
[03:09:04.047 --> 03:09:07.129]  By people, I mean the Bush administration.
[03:09:07.129 --> 03:09:18.416]  But I would like to have either a transcript of this meeting that took place between Cheney and who else, or someone having written the minutes or a memo on the meeting.
[03:09:18.416 --> 03:09:20.338]  It would be a little stronger if we had that.
[03:09:20.338 --> 03:09:25.241]  But it's totally consistent with the Manning memo that I talk about.
[03:09:26.061 --> 03:09:43.259]  In my book, The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder, where Bush himself, not just Cheney, but Bush himself is talking about how to provoke a war with Saddam Hussein, I agree with you 100% that this is relevant, even though they didn't go ahead and do it, because it's reflective of their state of mind.
[03:09:43.259 --> 03:09:48.324]  And that's very important in a criminal trial, their state of mind, that they are willing
[03:09:49.318 --> 03:09:53.464]  To deliberately deceive the American public in taking this nation to war.
[03:09:53.464 --> 03:09:57.029]  And it also shows premeditation for dastardly deeds.
[03:09:57.029 --> 03:09:57.710]  Absolutely.
[03:09:57.710 --> 03:09:58.051]  Absolutely.
[03:09:58.051 --> 03:10:01.315]  So whether they go ahead on it or not is not relevant.
[03:10:01.315 --> 03:10:04.059]  The relevant thing is what's their state of mind that they're very willing
[03:10:05.661 --> 03:10:10.306]  Well, Vincent Bugliosi, we're going to get into your book, we're going to get into the Manning Memo.
[03:10:10.306 --> 03:10:13.069]  I want you to spend some time on that first, since it does dovetail.
[03:10:13.069 --> 03:10:25.963]  But as a famous, highly respected prosecutor and legal scholar, if I met with 10 guys and discussed 12 different crimes, and were seriously thinking about implementing them, isn't that a crime in and of itself?
[03:10:26.743 --> 03:10:28.165]  Um, not really.
[03:10:28.165 --> 03:10:29.887]  It comes pretty close to it.
[03:10:29.887 --> 03:10:36.134]  Um, well, you could say yes, a conspiracy to commit the crime, except at common law, that was enough.
[03:10:36.134 --> 03:10:42.101]  But today, in addition to the agreement, there has to be what they call an overt act, a step taken.
[03:10:42.101 --> 03:10:43.162]  It does not have to be a big step.
[03:10:43.720 --> 03:10:47.182]  But a step taken to carry out the object of the conspiracy.
[03:10:47.182 --> 03:10:50.765]  So there is the agreement, which is one element of the crime of conspiracy.
[03:10:50.765 --> 03:10:56.209]  But here, if that's all there was, there was no over-back to further what they were agreeing on.
[03:10:57.774 --> 03:10:58.234]  To do.
[03:10:58.234 --> 03:11:01.317]  But it's another major investigation, is it not?
[03:11:01.317 --> 03:11:04.600]  Oh, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely, of course.
[03:11:04.600 --> 03:11:12.887]  It shows that they want to take the nation to war on a lie, but there has to be some step that they take in furtherance of the object of that agreement.
[03:11:12.887 --> 03:11:13.948]  And I don't hear that here.
[03:11:13.948 --> 03:11:16.490]  Even in the Manning Memo, we don't have that.
[03:11:16.490 --> 03:11:21.254]  But we do have Bush showing that he wanted to take the nation to war on a lie.
[03:11:21.254 --> 03:11:22.575]  Tell folks about the Manning Memo.
[03:11:22.575 --> 03:11:25.397]  I mean, not everybody is aware of it like you are in a book about it.
[03:11:25.397 --> 03:11:25.878]  Tell us about it.
[03:11:26.676 --> 03:11:35.282]  Well, the Manning Memo is just one piece of evidence that I present in my book to show that George Bush is guilty of murder.
[03:11:35.282 --> 03:11:38.564]  And it shows his state of mind that he wanted to go to war on a lie.
[03:11:38.564 --> 03:11:41.026]  The date was January the 31st, 2003.
[03:11:41.026 --> 03:11:43.748]  And by the way, we're not talking about the Downing Street Memo.
[03:11:43.748 --> 03:11:46.129]  That's a totally different memo, and it's kind of ambiguous.
[03:11:46.129 --> 03:11:49.892]  If I prosecuted Bush, that would be offered, but it's not strong enough to go to war.
[03:11:49.892 --> 03:11:51.733]  I mean, to go to a trial.
[03:11:51.733 --> 03:11:54.395]  Yeah, that's telling the British, fix intelligence, we're going to lie.
[03:11:55.055 --> 03:12:01.602]  Yeah, but there was no source for that, and it's a little ambiguous what fixing the evidence means.
[03:12:01.602 --> 03:12:08.290]  It could mean creating evidence, which would be very, very serious, or it could mean cherry-picking, which is a lot weaker.
[03:12:08.290 --> 03:12:14.717]  But the Manning Memo, this is January 31st, 2003, Bush met with British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
[03:12:15.684 --> 03:12:24.127]  In the Oval Office for two hours with six of his top aides, including Blair's Chief Foreign Policy Advisor, David Manning.
[03:12:24.127 --> 03:12:34.551]  After the meeting, Manning prepared a five-page memo stamp, quote, extremely sensitive, unquote, in which he summarized, Alex, what was said at the meeting.
[03:12:34.551 --> 03:12:38.233]  And among other things, he said that George Bush, not Blair, but Bush,
[03:12:39.435 --> 03:12:59.401]  Uh, was so worried about the failure of UN inspectors to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq that he talked about three possible ways to quote, provoke a confrontation, unquote, with Hussein, one of which Bush said was to quote, fly U-2 reconnaissance aircraft over Iraq, falsely painted in United Nations colors.
[03:12:59.401 --> 03:13:07.223]  And Bush said that if Hussein fired upon them, uh, he'd be in violation of UN resolutions and that would justify our going to war.
[03:13:07.990 --> 03:13:25.826]  Now, here we have Alex, George Bush, telling the American people, telling the world, that Hussein was an imminent threat to the security of this country, but behind closed doors, this small man was talking about how to provoke Hussein into a war.
[03:13:25.826 --> 03:13:29.169]  Now, if Bush honestly, and let's try to tell a lie as a word, honestly,
[03:13:29.941 --> 03:13:43.692]  If he honestly believed that Hussein was an imminent threat to the security of this country, which is the main reason he gave the American people going to war, by definition, the thought of provoking Hussein into a war would never, ever have entered his mind.
[03:13:43.692 --> 03:13:47.155]  I was on the Dennis Moore Show a couple weeks ago.
[03:13:47.155 --> 03:13:52.059]  Dennis fell hopelessly in love with the Republican Party at the time of 9-11, and I poked fun of him in my book.
[03:13:52.901 --> 03:14:04.251]  And I said, Dennis, you're defending George Bush at his trial for murder, and the prosecutor calls David Manning to the witness stand to testify to what your guy said on January 31st, 2003.
[03:14:04.251 --> 03:14:10.196]  Other than trying to hide beneath the consul table, Dennis, what would your response be to David Manning's testimony?
[03:14:10.196 --> 03:14:12.218]  And Dennis is bright and quick.
[03:14:12.218 --> 03:14:15.741]  He said, I'd ask for a recess.
[03:14:15.741 --> 03:14:16.882]  No matter how long that recess
[03:14:17.629 --> 03:14:43.744]  uh... went on for ten minutes an hour a week uh... or a year there's no answer to the manning uh... memo other than guilt it clearly shows george bush uh... wanted to take the national war on a lie uh... the fact that they didn't implement that is not relevant uh... it's relevant in that we couldn't prosecute it on that alone but it shows that he lied when he told the nation that he believed that hussein was an imminent threat to this country because if you believe that
[03:14:44.364 --> 03:14:48.368]  He never, by definition, would have been talking about how to provoke Hussein into a war.
[03:14:48.368 --> 03:15:01.902]  And he then had his surrogates go out and produce, excised, as you covered in the hearings last week, before the judiciary, false, dummied-up reports that had then been brought to Congress and before the United Nations.
[03:15:01.902 --> 03:15:05.346]  So he had his surrogates all over, pushing a line, and then took us to the war.
[03:15:06.267 --> 03:15:10.731]  Yeah, in fact, on June 16th, I got a call here in L.A.
[03:15:10.731 --> 03:15:19.979]  from a very conservative Republican congressman from the South who voted for the war, was one of its most vocal supporters.
[03:15:19.979 --> 03:15:28.947]  I'm not giving his name right now because he's running for re-election, but he told me that come November, he wants to be on my side, hopefully when George Bush is indicted for murder, in any event.
[03:15:30.071 --> 03:15:45.199]  He heard the tape on the book, The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder, and he called me, and he said, Mr. Brioza, I want to tell you that I'm convinced now that George Bush misled Congress, he didn't mention the American people, he misled Congress into war.
[03:15:45.199 --> 03:15:58.966]  I've given several copies of the book to colleagues, including John Conyers, who called me, by the way, about a month ago, or three weeks ago, I forget how long ago, but anyway, he said he was reading the book, and he had gotten a copy of the book.
[03:15:59.890 --> 03:16:09.595]  And he said that, um, where am I here on the story here, um, I'm talking about, um, this Republican Congressman.
[03:16:09.595 --> 03:16:16.418]  He said he's given them a copy of the book, asked them to read it, and told them, read the book, uh, we were lied to.
[03:16:17.256 --> 03:16:25.482]  He felt very bad himself that he was susceptible to that lie, and I told him, uh, Congressman, do not feel that way.
[03:16:25.482 --> 03:16:29.446]  You were not, as he learned in the book, you were not given the information that you were supposed to be given.
[03:16:29.446 --> 03:16:31.827]  Now, what is that information?
[03:16:31.827 --> 03:16:45.198]  Well, Bush, on the evening of October the 7th, 2002, from Cincinnati, Ohio, this was his first reference to Hussein in Iraq being a threat to the country, he told the nation that, um,
[03:16:46.075 --> 03:16:57.037]  That Hussein was an imminent threat to the security of this country, either by his attacking us with weapons of mass destruction or giving those weapons to a terrorist group to attack us.
[03:16:57.037 --> 03:17:03.699]  And he said this attack can happen, quote, on any given day, unquote, meaning the threat was imminent.
[03:17:03.699 --> 03:17:11.040]  The big problem for George Bush is that the evidence shows that what he told the American people was the exact opposite
[03:17:11.761 --> 03:17:21.965]  Of what his own CIA had told him just six days earlier in a classified October 1st report, that Hussein was not an imminent threat.
[03:17:21.965 --> 03:17:25.606]  Now we get into the issue of deletions.
[03:17:25.606 --> 03:17:26.586]  And it gets worse.
[03:17:26.586 --> 03:17:32.788]  October the 4th, and I told Congress this, and they were taking notes, it looked like, to me.
[03:17:32.788 --> 03:17:35.949]  If they weren't taking notes, they were certainly listening very intently.
[03:17:35.949 --> 03:17:40.451]  In fact, Conyers, the fellow to his left, the Republican congressman, literally tried to shut me down.
[03:17:41.528 --> 03:17:42.749]  And he made this remark.
[03:17:42.749 --> 03:17:44.090]  Lamar Smith.
[03:17:44.090 --> 03:17:51.797]  He said, uh, he said, I, not referring to me, but he said, um, I'm about to have an aneurysm.
[03:17:51.797 --> 03:18:08.572]  Now, I don't know if that was a Freudian slip or what have you, but I told, uh, I told Congress that in this October 4th, um, uh, unclassified version of the, of the classified report, it was called the white paper.
[03:18:09.460 --> 03:18:11.102]  This is what the Bush administration did.
[03:18:11.102 --> 03:18:16.947]  They had an unclassified summary version of an October 1st report to give to Congress and the American people.
[03:18:16.947 --> 03:18:21.451]  And in this unclassified version, the conclusion of U.S.
[03:18:21.451 --> 03:18:23.693]  intelligence, we're talking about 16 U.S.
[03:18:23.693 --> 03:18:27.777]  intelligence agencies led by the CIA, the conclusion of U.S.
[03:18:27.777 --> 03:18:32.502]  intelligence that Hussein was not an imminent threat to the security of this country,
[03:18:33.183 --> 03:18:35.306]  Was completely deleted.
[03:18:35.306 --> 03:18:38.470]  Every single one of those all-important words was taken out.
[03:18:38.470 --> 03:18:39.832]  So Congress never saw that.
[03:18:39.832 --> 03:18:44.258]  And I was telling this Congressman, as he learned from the book, you never saw that.
[03:18:46.300 --> 03:18:48.581]  I can't tell you how serious this is.
[03:18:48.581 --> 03:19:03.828]  Those who don't understand, they premeditatedly edited the 16 agencies reports, created a fraud, and then put it forward as 16 anonymous agencies saying he is a threat when they said he isn't an imminent threat.
[03:19:03.828 --> 03:19:05.089]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[03:19:07.390 --> 03:19:09.652]  The consensus of 16 U.S.
[03:19:09.652 --> 03:19:22.503]  intelligence agencies was that Hussein was not an imminent threat to security to this country, but the white paper that was given to Congress just seven days, just seven days before Congress voted on whether to authorize George Bush to go to war, October 11th.
[03:19:23.582 --> 03:19:25.904]  Uh, did not contain that statement.
[03:19:25.904 --> 03:19:27.745]  It did not contain several other things.
[03:19:27.745 --> 03:19:31.488]  And when we get back, I'd like to talk about, talk to you about several other things that were not in that report.
[03:19:31.488 --> 03:19:31.949]  Absolutely.
[03:19:31.949 --> 03:19:35.651]  Vincent Bugliosi is our guest, the famed prosecutor.
[03:19:35.651 --> 03:19:36.952]  He says he's got the edge.
[03:19:36.952 --> 03:19:38.954]  George Bush is a mass murderer.
[03:19:38.954 --> 03:19:39.654]  That's the facts.
[03:19:39.654 --> 03:19:40.255]  We'll be right back.
[03:19:45.982 --> 03:19:49.865]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[03:19:49.865 --> 03:19:51.265]  dollar has been devaluating.
[03:19:51.265 --> 03:19:55.148]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[03:19:55.148 --> 03:19:58.050]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[03:19:58.050 --> 03:20:00.131]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[03:20:00.131 --> 03:20:02.272]  They've both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[03:20:03.493 --> 03:20:09.115]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[03:20:09.115 --> 03:20:11.676]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.

[03:20:49.573 --> 03:20:51.816]  9-11 was an inside job.
[03:20:51.816 --> 03:20:53.378]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[03:20:53.378 --> 03:20:55.020]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[03:20:55.020 --> 03:20:57.783]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[03:20:57.783 --> 03:21:03.931]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the bilateral commission, the C.A.F.R., and Lisa Dantzscher.
[03:21:06.699 --> 03:21:11.262]  It's the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[03:21:11.262 --> 03:21:17.425]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[03:21:17.425 --> 03:21:19.926]  An inside job?
[03:21:19.926 --> 03:21:24.029]  How dare you?
[03:21:24.029 --> 03:21:27.631]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[03:21:27.631 --> 03:21:30.332]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[03:21:30.332 --> 03:21:35.455]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of

[03:21:46.723 --> 03:21:54.729]  Above stoplights, on toll booths, and scanning the freeways just waiting to snap a photo of your license plate only to slam you with ridiculous fines.

[03:23:51.993 --> 03:23:55.916]  Famed prosecutor of the Manson family and many other famous cases, best-selling author,
[03:23:57.438 --> 03:23:59.940]  Vincent Bugliosi is our guest for the rest of the hour.
[03:23:59.940 --> 03:24:07.166]  We're going to open the phones up about the impeachment hearings last week, about where all this is going.
[03:24:07.166 --> 03:24:12.190]  I also want to ask him later, is he fearing for his safety going up against this mafia?
[03:24:12.190 --> 03:24:14.552]  Has he got any threats?
[03:24:14.552 --> 03:24:25.041]  But continuing with the absolute evidence that, I mean, you use the number of 100,000 dead in Iraq, but most of the big, the lands at study and
[03:24:26.124 --> 03:24:31.748]  You know, other international respected groups who are non-partisan have said that it's closer to a million now.
[03:24:31.748 --> 03:24:35.350]  I mean, two and a half years ago it was six hundred plus thousand dead.
[03:24:35.350 --> 03:24:40.954]  But being conservative, a hundred thousand dead in Iraq, I mean, this is murder.
[03:24:40.954 --> 03:24:42.215]  This is premeditated.
[03:24:42.215 --> 03:24:42.715]  Please continue.
[03:24:43.115 --> 03:24:51.341]  Of course, but by the way, Alex, in my endnotes, a lot of times people don't read endnotes, but my endnotes are a little different than a lot of people.
[03:24:51.341 --> 03:24:55.064]  Some of my endnotes go on for 20, 30 pages in my book on the Kennedy Fascination.
[03:24:55.064 --> 03:24:59.047]  I have an endnote that goes on for 60 pages, I think, with about 30 footnotes.
[03:24:59.047 --> 03:25:10.556]  I'm not dropping names here, but Johnny Carson said, Vince, I read all your endnotes, but the only reason I mention that now is I do mention what you say about the estimates being as high as one million, and that was about a year ago.
[03:25:11.156 --> 03:25:17.898]  So I'm using a very conservative number in the main text of a 100,000.
[03:25:17.898 --> 03:25:35.443]  Summarizing what I'm saying up to where we left off, we have Bush then telling the nation on October the 7th that Hussein was an imminent threat to the security of this country, and he was telling millions of unsuspecting Americans the exact opposite of what his own CIA had told him just six days earlier.
[03:25:36.338 --> 03:25:38.299]  Uh, that Hussein was not an imminent threat.
[03:25:38.299 --> 03:25:48.905]  And then I was pointing out to you that on October the 4th, the Bush administration put out an unclassified summary version of this classified report so they could give it to Congress and the American people.
[03:25:48.905 --> 03:26:00.692]  And this report was called the White Paper, and in that White Paper, uh, the main conclusion of the October 1st classified report that Hussein was not an imminent threat was completely deleted.
[03:26:00.692 --> 03:26:03.233]  So, Congress and the American people did not see that.
[03:26:03.233 --> 03:26:04.154]  There were two other things
[03:26:05.043 --> 03:26:25.059]  In that classified report that Congress and the American people never saw, and the Republican Congressmen saw it for the first time in the book, one, the conclusion, it was an erroneous conclusion, that Hussein and weapons of mass destruction, we subsequently learned that they were all destroyed in 1991 at the end of the Persian Gulf War,
[03:26:25.976 --> 03:26:36.363]  That conclusion was stated in the Classified Report as an opinion, with the words, we assess that, or we judge that, Hussein has weapons of mass destruction.
[03:26:36.363 --> 03:26:44.649]  The white report, uh, the white paper, the words, we judge that, we assess that, were deleted, and that opinion was stated as a fact.
[03:26:44.649 --> 03:26:48.071]  The words were, Hussein has weapons of mass destruction.
[03:26:48.071 --> 03:26:55.576]  Also, there were several very important dissents in the area of nuclear weapons in the Classified Report.
[03:26:56.249 --> 03:27:00.150]  All of those dissents were deleted from the white paper.
[03:27:00.150 --> 03:27:07.973]  This is extremely powerful evidence that Bush took this nation to war knowingly and deliberately on a lie, under false pretenses.
[03:27:07.973 --> 03:27:16.255]  And therefore, under the law, under the law, he's guilty of murder for the death of over 4,000 young American soldiers who have died so far fighting his war.
[03:27:16.255 --> 03:27:19.416]  Not your war, Alex, or my war, or America's war, but his war.
[03:27:20.228 --> 03:27:33.471]  One of the key issues that I knew would come up, if there's going to be a prosecution, and there very well could be after he leaves office, right now he has temporary immunity, is whether there's jurisdiction to prosecute George Bush.
[03:27:33.471 --> 03:27:35.191]  And I spent a great number of hours at the L.A.
[03:27:35.191 --> 03:27:38.772]  County Law Library, the 9th Circuit Library, trying to establish jurisdiction.
[03:27:38.772 --> 03:27:46.253]  I was unable to establish jurisdiction for the well over 100,000 innocent Iraqi men, women, children, and babies who have died in his war.
[03:27:46.253 --> 03:27:49.354]  Bush is guilty of those murders, but I couldn't establish jurisdiction for them.
[03:27:50.017 --> 03:27:57.202]  But I was able to establish jurisdiction to prosecute Bush for the murder of the over 4,000 young American soldiers.
[03:27:57.202 --> 03:28:01.205]  And I established jurisdiction for the Attorney General in Washington, D.C.
[03:28:01.205 --> 03:28:03.827]  acting through his Department of Justice.
[03:28:03.827 --> 03:28:05.909]  We're only talking really about one prosecutor there.
[03:28:05.909 --> 03:28:06.930]  There's 93 U.S.
[03:28:06.930 --> 03:28:11.533]  attorneys around the country, but they're not going to bring an action against Bush without the consent of their boss.
[03:28:11.533 --> 03:28:17.318]  But on a state level, I established jurisdiction for the Attorney General, Alex, in each of the 50 states.
[03:28:18.522 --> 03:28:32.716]  Plus the approximately 950 district attorneys in counties within those states to prosecute Bush for the murder of any soldier or soldiers from their state or county who died fighting Bush's war in Iraq.
[03:28:32.716 --> 03:28:42.906]  So with over or approximately 1,000 prosecutors out there in this land of ours, and with all the evidence of guilt that I present in my book, The Prosecution of George Bush for Murder,
[03:28:43.740 --> 03:28:50.524]  I don't think it's unreasonable to believe, Alex, that there's at least one prosecutor out there that's courageous enough to step forward.
[03:28:50.524 --> 03:28:51.945]  Maybe there's many more.
[03:28:51.945 --> 03:28:54.967]  Step forward and say, this is the United States of America.
[03:28:54.967 --> 03:28:57.948]  In America, no man is above the law.
[03:28:57.948 --> 03:29:01.730]  The evidence of Bush's guilt is clear, so I'm going to go after him.
[03:29:01.730 --> 03:29:11.716]  And when we talk about 1,000 prosecutors, before Bush passes away, that number may go up to 7,000 or 8,000 prosecutors, because there's no statute of limitations for the crime of murder.
[03:29:11.716 --> 03:29:12.877]  You know, Pinochet down in Chile.
[03:29:13.803 --> 03:29:18.685]  Uh, 33 years later, they brought murder charges against him.
[03:29:18.685 --> 03:29:22.646]  Stay there, Vincent Bugliosi, and I want to talk about what's happening now.
[03:29:22.646 --> 03:29:23.967]  They're cornered rats.
[03:29:23.967 --> 03:29:27.668]  They need a new war.
[03:29:27.668 --> 03:29:35.471]  If, getting in the mind of the criminals, what do you think they're planning to do to stop your investigation and others' investigations?
[03:29:35.471 --> 03:29:36.872]  We're on the march.
[03:29:36.872 --> 03:29:39.393]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:39.393 --> 03:29:42.094]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:45.495 --> 03:29:52.240]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:29:52.240 --> 03:29:54.882]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:29:54.882 --> 03:29:56.443]  But who is the enemy?
[03:29:56.443 --> 03:29:57.224]  Bin Laden.
[03:29:57.224 --> 03:29:58.105]  This is his ammo.
[03:29:58.105 --> 03:29:59.626]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:29:59.626 --> 03:30:01.067]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:30:01.587 --> 03:30:08.733]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:30:08.733 --> 03:30:09.213]  Some U.S.
[03:30:09.213 --> 03:30:15.578]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:30:15.578 --> 03:30:19.021]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:30:19.281 --> 03:30:29.549]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[03:30:29.549 --> 03:30:30.770]  Fabled enemies.

[03:30:47.059 --> 03:31:01.250]  I had the opportunity to speak to my 90-year-old grandmother at some length here recently, and she was talking about the Great Depression, and we were talking about the gas prices, the food prices, this economic uncertainty we're in, these, you know, really kind of perilous times, no one knows where we're headed or where we might end up.
[03:31:01.250 --> 03:31:08.796]  And she was reminded of the Great Depression and how, in those days, folks who lived in the country did okay because they had chicken and eggs and they could grow gardens and can their food.
[03:31:08.796 --> 03:31:16.422]  But how difficult it was for people who lived in urban areas or in the cities, because they didn't have the landscape for gardening or the know-how, and they didn't have the chickens and the livestock.
[03:31:17.022 --> 03:31:17.902]  What's different for them?
[03:31:17.902 --> 03:31:19.823]  Well, we know one thing's certain right now.
[03:31:19.823 --> 03:31:23.785]  We're headed into much higher prices on food, and there is a global food shortage.
[03:31:23.785 --> 03:31:24.926]  Now, what can you do to prepare?
[03:31:24.926 --> 03:31:25.926]  Do what I did.
[03:31:25.926 --> 03:31:27.487]  Sell some toys off in the garage.
[03:31:27.487 --> 03:31:30.288]  Go to the J. Michael Stevens eFoodsDirect.com company.
[03:31:30.288 --> 03:31:32.149]  Get some food and put it away, and be safe.

[03:31:45.035 --> 03:31:47.996]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[03:31:47.996 --> 03:31:57.499]  Did you know that in 1975, 32 senators and 92 representatives signed the Declaration of Interdependence, which stated that we must bring about a new world order?
[03:31:57.499 --> 03:32:02.860]  It called for the surrender of our national sovereignty to international organizations.
[03:32:02.860 --> 03:32:07.742]  It called for the redistribution of the wealth from America to third and fourth world countries.
[03:32:08.542 --> 03:32:19.768]  This is the same New World Order call for by President, former President George Herbert Walker Bush 210 times at the start of the Iraqi War 1990-1991.

[03:33:07.040 --> 03:33:09.881]  County when he was prosecutor there.
[03:33:09.881 --> 03:33:10.322]  105 out of 106.
[03:33:10.322 --> 03:33:16.825]  Won 21 consecutive murder trials.
[03:33:16.825 --> 03:33:18.686]  He's Vincent Bugliosi, best-selling author.
[03:33:18.686 --> 03:33:20.807]  Books he's written have been made into films, TV shows, you name it.
[03:33:22.088 --> 03:33:30.890]  Mr. Bugliosi, getting into the mind, you know, you've studied criminology, you've been death-threatened before, you've dealt with these type of individuals.
[03:33:30.890 --> 03:33:36.771]  We know that psychopaths, the controlled psychopaths, go for positions of power throughout history.
[03:33:36.771 --> 03:33:50.534]  Comparing the mind of Charlie Manson and other psychos you put away with George Bush, with Cheney, with the neocons, with their nasty mindset, give us your analysis on their mindset.
[03:33:51.855 --> 03:33:54.497]  Well, I don't know if I have an authority on the mindset.
[03:33:54.497 --> 03:34:02.923]  You know, I had to prove that the defendant committed the crime, and that there was no legal justification for him to do so.
[03:34:02.923 --> 03:34:07.526]  We certainly got into the mind in the resolution of that issue.
[03:34:07.526 --> 03:34:16.252]  But motive is not an element of the corpus delicti of any crime, so I've actually put people on death row without knowing for sure why they committed the crime.
[03:34:16.252 --> 03:34:21.016]  All I knew is that they had done it, put someone in their grave six feet under, and they had no legal justification for doing so.
[03:34:22.043 --> 03:34:26.604]  Asking me to compare Manson with Bush.
[03:34:26.604 --> 03:34:30.045]  Manson obviously was a very evil person.
[03:34:30.045 --> 03:34:33.306]  Let me get that off the hook here so we're not interrupted.
[03:34:33.306 --> 03:34:40.628]  Manson was a very evil person who wanted to kill as many people as he could.
[03:34:40.628 --> 03:34:45.389]  And I knew that if he was not stopped, he would have killed as many people as he could have.
[03:34:46.369 --> 03:34:48.770]  Someone who knew Manson a lot better than I did, because he lived with him.
[03:34:48.770 --> 03:34:50.470]  Little Paul Watkins, he's dead now.
[03:34:50.470 --> 03:34:56.092]  He said, Vince, death is Charlie's trip.
[03:34:56.092 --> 03:35:08.816]  So I would classify Manson as being a very evil human being who placed no value on human life, and he had a passion for death, blood, and murder.
[03:35:08.816 --> 03:35:11.196]  Bush, I would not say is evil.
[03:35:11.196 --> 03:35:13.017]  He certainly doesn't want to kill anyone.
[03:35:15.291 --> 03:35:21.372]  But he's a despicable human being who couldn't care less when people do die.
[03:35:21.372 --> 03:35:43.236]  He's extremely arrogant, extremely self-centered, and one of the emotional underpinnings for this book, basically, is the fact that, and we're getting into this issue now, that he couldn't possibly care less about the fact that his own people were being killed or the death of innocent Iraqi civilians.
[03:35:44.136 --> 03:36:01.880]  One of the emotional underpinnings from my book is the fact that the evidence is overwhelming that throughout the hell on earth, that Bush created an Iraq with over 100,000 people dying horrible, violent deaths and hundreds of thousands of their survivors crying out hysterically and having terrible nightmares over what happened to their loved ones.
[03:36:01.880 --> 03:36:05.281]  This guy, George Bush, has smiled through it all.
[03:36:05.281 --> 03:36:08.442]  In fact, we see a photo of Bush and six or seven other people smiling.
[03:36:08.442 --> 03:36:12.243]  Alex, who has the biggest smile on his face right in the middle of the war, George Bush.
[03:36:12.873 --> 03:36:19.536]  The evidence is very clear and anyone that tries to dispute it is just going to be looking like a fool.
[03:36:19.536 --> 03:36:32.422]  That while young American soldiers, 18, 19 year old kids, Alex, who never had a chance to live out their dreams, were being blown to pieces by roadside bombs in Iraq, Bush was having a lot of fun
[03:36:33.388 --> 03:36:35.249]  And enjoying life to the very fullest.
[03:36:35.249 --> 03:36:42.391]  I'm talking about running, bicycling, joking with friends, slapping backs, dancing and swiveling in hips like Elvis to blaring music.
[03:36:42.391 --> 03:36:46.713]  Almost always appearing to be in the very best of good spirits.
[03:36:46.713 --> 03:36:47.133]  Exactly!
[03:36:47.133 --> 03:36:49.574]  Let me just stop you, Vincent Pagliosi.
[03:36:49.574 --> 03:36:54.576]  I mean, just covering serious issues on this show, I've become more of a serious person.
[03:36:54.576 --> 03:36:55.656]  I'm very serious in life.
[03:36:56.897 --> 03:36:58.900]  And you see a judge, they try to be solemn.
[03:36:58.900 --> 03:37:02.284]  You see police, they try to be professional and solemn.
[03:37:02.284 --> 03:37:03.906]  With Bush, he's always clowning around.
[03:37:03.906 --> 03:37:07.670]  And then he lied and said, oh, I haven't been playing golf since the war started.
[03:37:07.670 --> 03:37:09.432]  And it turns out he's playing every week.
[03:37:09.432 --> 03:37:13.958]  So it's also the endless lying and just the arrogance, thinking we're all idiots.
[03:37:15.074 --> 03:37:31.104]  Yeah, you look at a photograph of people like, or presidents like Roosevelt, Truman, LBJ, and Nixon, a photograph of their faces during the time of war, their respective wars, and the photos reflect the grimness of the war.
[03:37:31.104 --> 03:37:37.388]  It was a very serious time, unlike any other president in American history during a time of war.
[03:37:38.127 --> 03:37:42.151]  Bush has regularly and routinely had a lot of fun and been in high spirits.
[03:37:42.151 --> 03:37:43.432]  Well, you can say what you want.
[03:37:43.432 --> 03:37:56.342]  You can say what you want about Nixon or LBJ, but they obsessed in the war room and tried to figure things out and got ulcers and lost sleep, and these weren't even very moral people in many respects, but they took it serious.
[03:37:56.342 --> 03:37:57.604]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:37:57.604 --> 03:38:05.210]  LBJ told one of his aides, Jack Valenti, that every time in the morning when he'd read a casualty report, it was like drinking carbolic acid.
[03:38:05.948 --> 03:38:15.332]  And for your audience out there, I would tell them that they don't have to take my word for this, or the photographs in the book, and they're not gotcha photos, they're photos showing Bush having an absolute ball.
[03:38:15.332 --> 03:38:21.474]  Bush himself has had no hesitancy at all in saying things like this, Alex, over and over again.
[03:38:21.474 --> 03:38:26.276]  And while I'm quoting Bush, these are just some quotes that are in the book, while I'm quoting him,
[03:38:27.108 --> 03:38:42.476]  Try to think, I'm asking your audience, you try to think of, at the very same time he's uttering these words, all of the death and the horror and the suffering and the screaming and the mutilations and beheadings that are taking place in Iraq while he's uttering these words.
[03:38:42.476 --> 03:38:43.957]  This is George Bush.
[03:38:43.957 --> 03:38:47.579]  Laura and I are having the time of our lives.
[03:38:47.579 --> 03:38:49.540]  I'm in a great mood.
[03:38:49.540 --> 03:38:51.842]  It's a perfect day.
[03:38:51.842 --> 03:38:54.183]  I'm feeling pretty good about life.
[03:38:54.975 --> 03:39:01.659]  Alex, if I killed one person, even accidentally, like in a car accident, I'd never have another perfect day for the rest of my life.
[03:39:01.659 --> 03:39:07.282]  And I'm telling you, this guy has been having a ball enjoying himself to the utmost throughout this entire war.
[03:39:07.282 --> 03:39:23.992]  And I say this, that even if George Bush was only guilty of making an innocent mistake in taking this nation to war in Iraq, not murder, as I firmly believe, with all of the death, horror, and suffering he has caused, what type of a monstrous individual is it
[03:39:24.594 --> 03:39:25.795]  Who could be happy with his life?
[03:39:25.795 --> 03:39:28.237]  There's no question that he's happy.
[03:39:28.237 --> 03:39:34.681]  I mean, as recently as March of this year, he shows up at a press conference to endorse McCain's candidacy.
[03:39:34.681 --> 03:39:35.722]  McCain shows up late.
[03:39:35.722 --> 03:39:36.903]  What does Bush do?
[03:39:36.903 --> 03:39:45.869]  Spontaneously, big smile on his face, he starts doing a soft-shoe tap-dancing routine to entertain the assembled media.
[03:39:46.725 --> 03:39:48.406]  You've probably heard of Mark McKinnon?
[03:39:48.406 --> 03:39:49.547]  Yes.
[03:39:49.547 --> 03:40:01.016]  Well, he's a bicycling friend of Bush, and I think he was the head of Bush's media campaign, or one of his strategists, I think he was the head of it, in the 2004 re-election campaign.
[03:40:01.016 --> 03:40:11.344]  He told the New York Times in 2005, right in the midst of all the horror and atrocities going on in Iraq, he said he'd never seen the President more calm, relaxed, and happy.
[03:40:12.105 --> 03:40:13.806]  And to me, this is almost unprecedented.
[03:40:13.806 --> 03:40:15.186]  I kind of went off on a little riff.
[03:40:15.186 --> 03:40:18.228]  You're asking me to compare Manson with Bush.
[03:40:18.228 --> 03:40:20.989]  Bush is a despicable human being.
[03:40:20.989 --> 03:40:26.891]  I don't believe he's lost one wink of sleep over all the death that he's caused in Iraq.
[03:40:26.891 --> 03:40:33.014]  Well, what about the working out three hours a day and taking two-hour naps and then says he doesn't even read the newspaper?
[03:40:33.596 --> 03:40:37.658]  Oh yeah, probably even more telling than all of this.
[03:40:37.658 --> 03:40:45.702]  My wife and I, during a seven-year period, I work seven days a week, I get to bed around two in the morning, wake up at ten, she says, you work from morning to morning.
[03:40:45.702 --> 03:40:53.025]  We had our 50th anniversary and we took three days off in the desert during a seven-year period that Bush was president.
[03:40:53.025 --> 03:40:57.067]  If it hadn't been for the anniversary, we probably wouldn't have even taken those three days off.
[03:40:57.067 --> 03:41:01.569]  Now the only reason I mention that is that I'm, you know, a cypher, a complete nobody.
[03:41:01.569 --> 03:41:02.610]  I'm just an author.
[03:41:03.399 --> 03:41:09.561]  During that same period, you know how many days George Bush took off for a vacation?
[03:41:09.561 --> 03:41:12.481]  Or at places like Kanabunkport?
[03:41:12.481 --> 03:41:16.302]  Well, I know it's around a third of the year he's on vacation.
[03:41:16.302 --> 03:41:17.502]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:41:17.502 --> 03:41:18.003]  908 days.
[03:41:18.003 --> 03:41:19.883]  So I take three days off and I'm nothing.
[03:41:19.883 --> 03:41:22.304]  He's the President of the United States.
[03:41:22.304 --> 03:41:28.645]  And I was told by the CBS radio guy who follows the White House, that up until January 1st, 2008, he had taken off 908 days on vacation.
[03:41:32.921 --> 03:41:35.583]  Here's someone that's not particularly bright at all.
[03:41:35.583 --> 03:41:41.005]  Everyone agrees, even his supporters, that he has an extremely low amount of knowledge.
[03:41:41.005 --> 03:41:48.630]  If you were to take the average person and put them in the presidency with Bush's lack of knowledge, what would that person do if he loved America?
[03:41:48.630 --> 03:41:54.393]  He'd work round the clock, trying to get as knowledgeable as he could, so he could represent this country in the best possible way.
[03:41:55.126 --> 03:41:59.309]  To bring it to a better condition than it presently is in.
[03:41:59.309 --> 03:42:02.211]  George Bush did the exact opposite.
[03:42:02.211 --> 03:42:04.213]  Took off 908 days.
[03:42:04.213 --> 03:42:05.194]  Why?
[03:42:05.194 --> 03:42:08.736]  Well, like I say in the book, it doesn't just show he's lazy.
[03:42:08.736 --> 03:42:09.537]  Everyone knows that.
[03:42:09.537 --> 03:42:10.938]  It shows that.
[03:42:10.938 --> 03:42:16.882]  It shows, in my opinion, I'm not positive of this, that this man does not love the United States of America.
[03:42:16.882 --> 03:42:17.523]  He doesn't hate it.
[03:42:17.523 --> 03:42:18.984]  He doesn't hate it.
[03:42:18.984 --> 03:42:21.646]  But he has no particular love for it.
[03:42:22.313 --> 03:42:26.858]  In one way you show your love for your country, obviously, is to fight for it.
[03:42:26.858 --> 03:42:33.545]  And this is what I have against, among many other things, against Bush and his fellow neocons in the right wing of the party.
[03:42:33.545 --> 03:42:35.947]  The tremendous hypocrisy of these people.
[03:42:35.947 --> 03:42:40.332]  They're the most repugnant, hypocritical, un-American people in our society.
[03:42:40.332 --> 03:42:43.395]  When it was their time, this is just one example, I'm sure you have many more, Alex.
[03:42:44.079 --> 03:42:48.861]  When it was their time to fight for America in the Vietnam War, show their love for this country.
[03:42:48.861 --> 03:42:49.382]  What did they do?
[03:42:49.382 --> 03:42:54.764]  I'm talking about the Bushes, the Cheneys, the Roves, the indescribably reprehensible Rush Limbaugh.
[03:42:54.764 --> 03:42:55.825]  What did they do?
[03:42:55.825 --> 03:42:59.207]  They ran like hell in the opposite direction.
[03:42:59.207 --> 03:43:06.210]  But now they have no hesitancy in waving the flag and shedding the blood of other people's children in far-off Iraq.
[03:43:06.210 --> 03:43:08.651]  These are not good people.
[03:43:08.651 --> 03:43:11.853]  With respect to Bush's monumental crime in this case, here's my
[03:43:12.726 --> 03:43:16.809]  Uh... view and I view it more as a fact than as an opinion.
[03:43:16.809 --> 03:43:24.154]  Because George Bush is a conservative Republican and so are they, anything he does, anything at all, including murder,
[03:43:25.202 --> 03:43:33.751]  Listen, I have people in my message board on InfoWars.com, and they come in and go, yeah, the government stages events to get us into war, it's good.
[03:43:33.751 --> 03:43:36.293]  Yeah, cops are tasing people to death, it's good.
[03:43:36.293 --> 03:43:41.139]  I mean, it seems like it's not just Bush and his psychopathic or sociopathic activities.
[03:43:41.139 --> 03:43:46.825]  The whole society, and I've always seen myself as, you know, a mainline conservative slash libertarian,
[03:43:47.545 --> 03:43:48.746]  But it's not just George Bush.
[03:43:48.746 --> 03:43:51.008]  It's a lot of these Republican followers.
[03:43:51.008 --> 03:43:53.429]  They think it's cute and funny to be evil.
[03:43:53.429 --> 03:43:55.491]  They think it's cute and funny Iraqis are dying.
[03:43:55.491 --> 03:44:03.356]  They post on their blogs pictures of Iraqi children with their feet blown off and talk about nuking them and turning them into a glass parking lot.
[03:44:03.356 --> 03:44:04.277]  They really are
[03:44:05.268 --> 03:44:07.770]  Demonic, psychopathic camp followers.
[03:44:07.770 --> 03:44:09.771]  Now, they wouldn't actually want to go below the kid's feet off.
[03:44:09.771 --> 03:44:17.697]  They'd throw up at the sight of real blood, but it's like some kind of some type of stunted bloodlust.
[03:44:17.697 --> 03:44:21.600]  It's like a little piggy-ish demon, and there's hordes of them.
[03:44:22.100 --> 03:44:25.081]  And I really think it's a society that's become very decadent.
[03:44:25.081 --> 03:44:31.642]  I think George Bush is an expression of the rotten sectors, not saying the whole country, it's a great country, that are out there.
[03:44:31.642 --> 03:44:38.504]  And it makes me ashamed because we can say they did it and they lied to us and Congress didn't know, but now the Democrats aren't going after them.
[03:44:38.504 --> 03:44:40.465]  The Democrats have still got us in the war.
[03:44:40.465 --> 03:44:43.685]  And it just makes me really ashamed to be an American.
[03:44:43.685 --> 03:44:45.946]  Well, Alex, I agree with everything you say.
[03:44:45.946 --> 03:44:49.507]  If we look at the genesis of this, I would add this addendum.
[03:44:50.605 --> 03:44:56.434]  These people that couldn't care less about all the killings of not only Iraqi citizens, but American soldiers.
[03:44:56.434 --> 03:44:57.255]  They couldn't care less.
[03:44:57.255 --> 03:44:59.258]  They say, well, this is war.
[03:44:59.258 --> 03:45:05.947]  My analysis is that the reason they're that way is that they are much more Republican than they are American.
[03:45:06.744 --> 03:45:08.085]  Let me ask you this.
[03:45:08.085 --> 03:45:14.647]  What do you think their state of mind would be if Bill Clinton were doing the same identical thing as George Bush?
[03:45:14.647 --> 03:45:15.687]  They'd be freaking out.
[03:45:15.687 --> 03:45:18.328]  They'd be running around, freaking out, pulling their hair out.
[03:45:18.328 --> 03:45:23.430]  Well, more than that, they'd want to skin him alive, hang him in the town square at noontime.
[03:45:23.430 --> 03:45:28.792]  I mean, here's a guy that had consensual sex outside of marriage, tried to cover it up.
[03:45:28.792 --> 03:45:30.132]  Just sublime silliness.
[03:45:30.132 --> 03:45:30.733]  Nothing at all.
[03:45:30.733 --> 03:45:31.433]  And what happened to him?
[03:45:32.526 --> 03:45:44.474]  With these right-wingers, day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year, he was savaged by the right-wing media, including the liberal New York Times and Washington Post.
[03:45:44.474 --> 03:45:55.722]  The monstrous Ken Starr, with federal funding, conducted a seven-year, $70 million effort to destroy the Clinton presidency.
[03:45:55.722 --> 03:45:57.803]  He was impeached.
[03:45:57.803 --> 03:45:59.965]  They tried to drive him from office for doing nothing.
[03:46:00.876 --> 03:46:08.102]  And here's George Bush, responsible for, like you say, probably over one million murders, and they don't want to do anything at all.
[03:46:08.102 --> 03:46:18.871]  And I say this, uh, Bush and his people have gotten away with thousands upon thousands of murders, and we, America, the American people, cannot let him do this.
[03:46:18.871 --> 03:46:20.492]  And this is why I'm not going to be satisfied.
[03:46:20.492 --> 03:46:26.777]  I may not succeed, but I'm not going to be satisfied until I see this guy in an American courtroom being prosecuted for first-degree murder.
[03:46:27.515 --> 03:46:31.277]  And if the jury convicts him, Alex, as you know, it'll be up to them to decide the appropriate punishment.
[03:46:31.277 --> 03:46:34.719]  One of their options being the imposition of the death penalty.
[03:46:34.719 --> 03:46:41.242]  The other option being life imprisonment, and life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.
[03:46:41.242 --> 03:46:41.842]  Are you there, Alex?
[03:46:41.842 --> 03:46:52.008]  Yes, I'm just stunned by the magnitude of what you're talking about, and again, I cut my teeth on talk radio attacking Bill Clinton for the Chinese generals and the missile secrets and the Arkansans, but compared to
[03:46:53.456 --> 03:46:54.397]  George Bush.
[03:46:54.397 --> 03:46:55.818]  I mean, I'm no fan of Bill Clinton.
[03:46:55.818 --> 03:46:57.960]  I know people that worked with him, were around him.
[03:46:57.960 --> 03:46:59.602]  The guy slept four hours a night.
[03:46:59.602 --> 03:47:02.144]  He constantly read all the government agency reports.
[03:47:02.144 --> 03:47:06.248]  He had at least pride in himself that he wanted to be sharp and know what was going on.
[03:47:06.248 --> 03:47:11.873]  And I mean, just a side issue, I've been reading the military reports themselves.
[03:47:11.873 --> 03:47:15.337]  Many of the VAs, roaches, flies, rats,
[03:47:16.487 --> 03:47:37.120]  No good health care, people that aren't even real doctors have been hired, overflowing toilets at bases everywhere, the C-130's falling apart, toilets overflowing, the men crapping in the aisles on the way over to Iraq, and then they've built all these pleasure planes for the brass, and it seems like we are Rome in 409 right before 410.
[03:47:37.120 --> 03:47:43.523]  I mean, it just seems like sectors of the government are just completely let them eat cake Marie Antoinette.
[03:47:45.327 --> 03:47:49.209]  Yeah, well, I can't disagree with anything that you say, Alex.
[03:47:49.209 --> 03:47:50.729]  As they say, I guess it's a new term.
[03:47:50.729 --> 03:47:53.911]  I'm still in the 19th century with a yellow pad and pencil.
[03:47:53.911 --> 03:47:54.931]  You're spot on.
[03:47:54.931 --> 03:47:55.892]  Is that a new term?
[03:47:55.892 --> 03:47:56.472]  Spot on?
[03:47:56.472 --> 03:47:59.233]  No, no, that's a good term.
[03:47:59.233 --> 03:48:00.234]  I'm not that familiar with it.
[03:48:00.234 --> 03:48:01.414]  I just heard it recently.
[03:48:01.414 --> 03:48:03.215]  Well, take the handling of the economy.
[03:48:03.215 --> 03:48:10.318]  The dollar's plunging, all these prices are up, and Bush is prancing around, what, two weeks ago saying the economy's just fine.
[03:48:10.318 --> 03:48:12.039]  Yeah.
[03:48:12.039 --> 03:48:13.400]  Talking about Clinton's
[03:48:14.298 --> 03:48:16.640]  Alleged crimes vis-a-vis Bush's.
[03:48:16.640 --> 03:48:35.896]  As you know, at the hearings Friday in Congress, there was a professor from Northwestern, Mr. Presser, I don't know his first name, but anyway, he was denouncing all the horrible things that George Bush did, but had no trouble with what... No, all the horrible things he said that Clinton did, but had no trouble with what George Bush did.
[03:48:35.896 --> 03:48:37.117]  And I just said to Mr. Presser,
[03:48:38.331 --> 03:48:47.173]  You apparently think it's worse what Clinton did, lying to the American public about consensual sex.
[03:48:47.173 --> 03:48:56.676]  And you feel that's worse than George Bush lying to the American public about going to war and all the death, horror, and suffering that has resulted from it.
[03:48:56.676 --> 03:48:59.917]  And I said, I would ask you this question, Mr. Presser.
[03:48:59.917 --> 03:49:04.558]  What previously recognized form of logic would allow you to reach a conclusion like that?
[03:49:04.558 --> 03:49:05.258]  And he was silent.
[03:49:06.826 --> 03:49:07.466]  Well, that's it.
[03:49:07.466 --> 03:49:11.869]  There's a craziness spreading across the country, but I don't give the Democrats cover.
[03:49:11.869 --> 03:49:13.649]  They should have already pulled out of Iraq.
[03:49:13.649 --> 03:49:18.512]  They should already be in full-blown impeachment hearings a year and a half ago, but we don't see that.
[03:49:18.512 --> 03:49:26.376]  Instead, we see Nancy Pelosi prancing around with Bush everywhere, so I think it's just going to continue under the Democrats.
[03:49:26.376 --> 03:49:26.876]  I want to take
[03:49:27.518 --> 03:49:31.422]  Some phone calls, uh, for our, uh, guest.
[03:49:31.422 --> 03:49:36.247]  And, uh, I don't want to keep you too much longer in the next hour, but can you do five minutes in the next hour?
[03:49:36.247 --> 03:49:36.928]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:49:36.928 --> 03:49:38.549]  Listen, I'm honored to be on this show.
[03:49:38.549 --> 03:49:40.892]  You're a stand-up guy, and I, uh, I can't thank you enough.
[03:49:40.892 --> 03:49:43.414]  You know, I've been blacked out by the major media in this country.
[03:49:43.414 --> 03:49:45.977]  Yeah, talk about the blackout in the minute we've got left before break.
[03:49:45.977 --> 03:49:47.819]  Oh, okay, good.
[03:49:47.819 --> 03:49:48.780]  Go ahead.
[03:49:48.780 --> 03:49:49.821]  Oh, right now?
[03:49:49.821 --> 03:49:50.502]  Well, um,
[03:49:51.132 --> 03:50:02.782]  My publisher said she had never seen another book in her over 30 years that had been totally blacked out by the mainstream national media, up until a New York Times article about two weeks ago pointing out the blackout.
[03:50:02.782 --> 03:50:04.563]  It was a total, complete blackout.
[03:50:04.563 --> 03:50:09.167]  No network, no cable.
[03:50:09.167 --> 03:50:09.828]  Total blackout.
[03:50:09.828 --> 03:50:13.711]  It got so bad that ABC Radio refused to take money from my publisher.
[03:50:14.420 --> 03:50:22.275]  To take out a radio spot on the news, on their network, for the book, Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder.
[03:50:22.275 --> 03:50:27.104]  But despite that, the book, because of people like you and incredible word of mouth,
[03:50:27.879 --> 03:50:29.940]  And that's because they know they're complicit going along with it.
[03:50:29.940 --> 03:50:32.142]  We'll be right back with your phone calls and Vincent Bugliosi.
[03:50:46.917 --> 03:50:52.562]  Are you tired of hearing that a cure for cancer is coming, but it will be available sometime in the future?

[03:51:44.898 --> 03:51:46.859]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[03:51:46.859 --> 03:51:50.461]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[03:51:50.461 --> 03:51:52.923]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[03:51:52.923 --> 03:51:55.965]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[03:51:55.965 --> 03:52:01.688]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[03:52:01.688 --> 03:52:05.611]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[03:52:54.232 --> 03:52:59.396]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.

[03:54:41.843 --> 03:54:44.745]  We have one of the most successful prosecutors in U.S.
[03:54:44.745 --> 03:54:49.769]  history, prosecuted the Mansons, among other unsavory people, let's put it lightly.
[03:54:50.309 --> 03:55:05.600]  Vincent Bugliosi, he has the new New York Times bestseller, despite a total media blackout, in mainstream controlled corporate media out of fear, and their complicity in all this, and they have a stake in the whole establishment, basically, the military industrial complex.
[03:55:05.600 --> 03:55:13.145]  In covering this up, despite that, it is number 9 on the New York Times bestseller list, the prosecution of George W. Bush for murder by Vincent Bugliosi.
[03:55:13.145 --> 03:55:15.526]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[03:55:15.526 --> 03:55:19.109]  Frankie, in Missouri, you're on the air with Vincent Bugliosi, Frankie.
[03:55:19.642 --> 03:55:20.922]  Chris, how you doing?
[03:55:20.922 --> 03:55:21.462]  Good, Frankie.
[03:55:21.462 --> 03:55:24.723]  Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones, I want you to understand something.
[03:55:24.723 --> 03:55:27.344]  We got a lot of love for you out here, brother.
[03:55:27.344 --> 03:55:30.245]  A lot of love.
[03:55:30.245 --> 03:55:30.765]  Well, thank you.
[03:55:30.765 --> 03:55:32.745]  Do you have a question for Vincent Bugliosi?
[03:55:32.745 --> 03:55:33.825]  Yes, Mr. Jones.
[03:55:33.825 --> 03:55:39.427]  I'm going to tell you, too, so how you doing, by the way?
[03:55:39.427 --> 03:55:41.407]  I don't want to drop another name.
[03:55:41.407 --> 03:55:47.369]  Warren Beatty asked me the same thing on Sunday, and I said, I'm angry.
[03:55:47.369 --> 03:55:48.029]  I'm angry.
[03:55:48.029 --> 03:55:49.029]  I'm very, very angry.
[03:55:49.963 --> 03:55:55.745]  Mr. Berlusconi, has there ever been a successful prosecution of somebody of Bush's status?
[03:55:55.745 --> 03:56:05.409]  And if this trial ever does come to court, will those that choose to prosecute him, will they live to see the verdict?
[03:56:07.645 --> 03:56:19.172]  Well, those that choose to prosecute him live to see the verdict that, well, you're saying there'd be a whole trial, and then before the verdict, after the trial, but just before the verdict, someone's gonna step forward and kill them?
[03:56:19.172 --> 03:56:20.693]  Is that what you're suggesting?
[03:56:20.693 --> 03:56:29.118]  Well, I would think that, you know, somebody that doesn't take on this type of job would have great concern.
[03:56:29.118 --> 03:56:33.481]  Well, I'm looking for a courageous prosecutor out there.
[03:56:33.481 --> 03:56:37.323]  About two weeks ago, not even that long, maybe a week and a half ago, the publisher sent out
[03:56:38.625 --> 03:56:59.069]  Uh, a copy of my book, Prosecution of George Bush for Murder, to each of the 50 state attorney generals in this country, with a cover letter from me, asking the prosecutor to read the book, and if they agree that the evidence of Bush's guilt is clear, and that there's jurisdiction that they proceed against him, they can't prosecute him right now, but they can commence the criminal investigation of him.
[03:56:59.753 --> 03:57:12.923]  And I offered my services to the prosecutor in whichever way he or she sees fit, which would range from being a consultant all the way up to and including being appointed a special prosecutor.
[03:57:12.923 --> 03:57:21.450]  I certainly would not be averse to prosecuting George W. Bush for murder, and I can tell you right now that unquestionably I would seek the death penalty against him.
[03:57:21.450 --> 03:57:28.355]  I mean, here's a guy, by the way, who was very much in favor of the death penalty, probably had the highest execution rate
[03:57:29.256 --> 03:57:33.757]  In the history of any governor, 152 cases came across his desk when he was governor of Texas.
[03:57:33.757 --> 03:57:38.618]  And by the way, he would give press conferences and then giggle and laugh about it and talk about how they begged him.
[03:57:38.618 --> 03:57:41.578]  I mean, if you're going to execute somebody, you don't make jokes about it.
[03:57:41.578 --> 03:57:50.700]  No, of course, but he signed off on 152 of 152, even signed off on a death warrant for a young man who was mentally retarded.
[03:57:50.700 --> 03:57:52.400]  So I would seek the death penalty against him.
[03:57:52.400 --> 03:57:57.481]  I've got to think there's at least one courageous prosecutor out there, and I'm going to be looking for him.
[03:57:58.907 --> 03:57:59.988]  Frankie, we've got to go to break.
[03:57:59.988 --> 03:58:01.329]  We've got to go to break.
[03:58:01.329 --> 03:58:02.670]  Thank you for the call, Frankie.
[03:58:02.670 --> 03:58:03.451]  More calls straight ahead.
[03:58:03.451 --> 03:58:05.092]  David, Walt, Steve and others.
[03:58:05.092 --> 03:58:11.636]  There is no doubt that Vincent Bugliosi is treading where angels fear to tread.
[03:58:11.636 --> 03:58:13.798]  I mean, there is no doubt that it is.
[03:58:13.798 --> 03:58:20.883]  This guy has really got a lot of will and nerve because we're dealing with global mafia here.
[03:58:20.883 --> 03:58:22.684]  George Bush is just their front man.
[03:58:22.684 --> 03:58:23.405]  We'll be right back.
[03:58:23.405 --> 03:58:28.048]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:30.837 --> 03:58:35.523]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:35.523 --> 03:58:38.746]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[03:58:38.746 --> 03:58:42.230]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:58:42.230 --> 03:58:44.873]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:58:44.873 --> 03:58:46.415]  But who is the enemy?
[03:58:46.415 --> 03:58:47.216]  Bin Laden.
[03:58:47.216 --> 03:58:48.177]  This is his ammo.
[03:58:48.177 --> 03:58:49.599]  We have to look to the Middle East.
