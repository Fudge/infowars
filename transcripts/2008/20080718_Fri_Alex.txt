[00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:03.012]  Mark Cornkey is our guest for the next hour and 51 minutes.
[00:00:24.585 --> 00:00:28.787]  Bill Clinton came out and tried to say that Mark Kornke was involved in the Oklahoma City bombing.
[00:00:29.267 --> 00:00:30.528]  That's how worried they were about him.
[00:00:30.548 --> 00:00:35.231]  Mark Kornke helped mobilize much of the major militia movement we've seen in the last 15 years.
[00:00:35.271 --> 00:00:36.131]  He's been demonized.
[00:00:36.491 --> 00:00:41.174]  He was also run off the road by police and then put into prison for seven years.
[00:00:41.214 --> 00:00:42.374]  And I have the squad car videos.
[00:00:42.434 --> 00:00:43.235]  It's absolutely nothing.
[00:00:43.855 --> 00:00:47.256]  They were basically trying to kill him, trying to frame him for a bank robbery.
[00:00:47.276 --> 00:00:48.136]  He had no criminal record.
[00:00:48.156 --> 00:00:51.057]  Of course, his family grew up right there in Dexter, Michigan.
[00:00:51.077 --> 00:00:52.157]  Dad in the Sheriff's Department.
[00:00:52.617 --> 00:00:55.278]  And they admitted that later, but first said it was for bank robbery.
[00:00:56.138 --> 00:00:59.319]  And he got out of prison, I forget.
[00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:00.699]  I know it was the last year or so.
[00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:06.460]  He's got his new book out in the Battle for the Republic series, part one.
[00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.141]  He's also got new militia manuals.
[00:01:08.441 --> 00:01:11.542]  We'll tell you how to get those several times before he leaves us.
[00:01:11.582 --> 00:01:12.822]  We're also going to open the phones up.
[00:01:13.802 --> 00:01:17.624]  To talk about a host of issues with Mark coming up in the next hour.
[00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:26.669]  For the next 50 minutes we're going to be talking as much as we can to Mark about a whole host of New World Order developments that are unfolding and moving very fast.
[00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:33.512]  The bank runs, Barack Obama announcing the one million man youth brigades with weapons to quote spy.
[00:01:33.532 --> 00:01:36.473]  Of course we know that he didn't hatch that, he's just pushing it.
[00:01:36.493 --> 00:01:37.774]  That's already been set up.
[00:01:38.134 --> 00:01:39.495]  They're just going public with it now.
[00:01:40.035 --> 00:01:54.984]  Also, the huge development off the charts, never before seen, National Guard being called out by the Governor for gun confiscation in Illinois under federal grants, just calmly inserted in a newscast, an announcement on NBC News in Chicago.
[00:01:55.444 --> 00:01:56.704]  Huge news!
[00:01:57.485 --> 00:02:02.348]  And we've got articles right now up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com on that.
[00:02:02.828 --> 00:02:06.110]  Also, Ron Paul came out yesterday in a speech on the floor.
[00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.831]  We're going to be covering this later.
[00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:13.837]  Where he said something big is about to happen, and he said our liberties will be taken.
[00:02:14.557 --> 00:02:17.558]  They want to launch this war for police, state, and martial law.
[00:02:17.998 --> 00:02:20.859]  So Ron Paul is saying the hour is near.
[00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:23.460]  This is the maximum alert for everybody.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.321]  This is the time to be warning people.
[00:02:25.361 --> 00:02:27.682]  The population is finally listening.
[00:02:28.122 --> 00:02:30.683]  That doesn't mean they know what's going on, but they're finally listening.
[00:02:30.703 --> 00:02:31.603]  They're not laughing.
[00:02:32.935 --> 00:02:35.157]  And so joining us in this dark hour is Mark Corgi.
[00:02:35.217 --> 00:02:40.702]  I want him on again next week as the dark times he foretold begin to unfold.
[00:02:41.462 --> 00:02:43.004]  Mark, it's great to have you back with us.
[00:02:43.504 --> 00:02:44.125]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:02:44.185 --> 00:02:48.348]  And again, you know, absolutely in this situation we have a watchman on the wall.
[00:02:48.428 --> 00:02:53.933]  Well, we've all been watchmen on the wall for a long time, but Ron Paul has been right in the middle of Barad-Dur.
[00:02:54.013 --> 00:02:55.935]  He's right in the middle of Mordor, okay?
[00:02:56.958 --> 00:03:01.780]  And as he and several other people have pointed out, they're seeing this firsthand.
[00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.661]  They know what's going on.
[00:03:02.721 --> 00:03:07.883]  So everybody out there listening, for those who were naysayers, we're going to do something right now.
[00:03:08.384 --> 00:03:08.724]  We.
[00:03:09.144 --> 00:03:09.584]  Told.
[00:03:09.944 --> 00:03:10.284]  You.
[00:03:10.765 --> 00:03:11.125]  So.
[00:03:12.826 --> 00:03:13.546]  Here's the thing.
[00:03:13.646 --> 00:03:15.907]  We've been under attack for a long time.
[00:03:16.167 --> 00:03:20.689]  The other side is getting, to a degree, impatient because they're getting old.
[00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:21.930]  Guys, we're outliving them.
[00:03:22.935 --> 00:03:25.036]  This is why they're going crazy.
[00:03:25.096 --> 00:03:27.237]  They're the ones that are in reaction mode.
[00:03:27.337 --> 00:03:29.798]  We're the ones in response mode.
[00:03:29.838 --> 00:03:30.358]  The difference?
[00:03:30.938 --> 00:03:34.680]  Reaction is knee-jerk desperation because of a lack of plan.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:47.325]  Okay, response is where we understand the threat, we see what's going on, we have the working knowledge to deal with it, plus we have the working knowledge to deal with any problem that exists after we get rid of the buggers.
[00:03:48.365 --> 00:03:49.806]  This is what they're scared to death of.
[00:03:49.847 --> 00:03:52.409]  There is a whole bunch of people out here in the United States.
[00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:53.530]  We're not wild-eyed.
[00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:54.291]  We're not crazy.
[00:03:54.351 --> 00:03:56.933]  We have been specifically pointing at the problem.
[00:03:57.714 --> 00:03:59.296]  We have demonstrated the problem.
[00:03:59.896 --> 00:04:01.658]  And we have the solution in hand.
[00:04:01.758 --> 00:04:04.761]  Now, there are several things that are going to have to be done at the same time, Alex.
[00:04:04.881 --> 00:04:07.644]  And the most important thing is to be physically prepared.
[00:04:07.684 --> 00:04:08.805]  You know, we've talked about this.
[00:04:09.471 --> 00:04:21.076]  We have, we have to deal with food, water, light manufacturing, the ability to take care of our people medically, and we have to be ready to fight to defend ourselves, and there are a lot of people in uniform who know this too.
[00:04:21.236 --> 00:04:24.298]  Now here's the one thing the other side is making the mistake on, and you know what?
[00:04:24.478 --> 00:04:25.378]  Fine, let them do it.
[00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:30.701]  There are a whole lot of people in uniform who are absolutely against this.
[00:04:31.864 --> 00:04:36.087]  I'm going to say something that I have had meetings with general staff officers.
[00:04:36.427 --> 00:04:37.168]  This is important.
[00:04:37.248 --> 00:04:38.989]  I'm going to do this publicly.
[00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:46.834]  People, their most common question at different times over the years, and this is in the Air Force, the Navy, the Army, and the Marines.
[00:04:47.435 --> 00:04:47.775]  Mark?
[00:04:48.135 --> 00:04:49.536]  Will the people stand with us?
[00:04:49.896 --> 00:04:50.677]  That's right.
[00:04:51.097 --> 00:05:00.764]  And all you out there listening, if you want to know what's going to make the difference between having liberty and not having liberty, go walk into the bathroom, look in the mirror, and look at the man or woman that's going to make the decision.
[00:05:02.111 --> 00:05:05.393]  It isn't going to be some silver magic bullet from, you know, somewhere else.
[00:05:05.473 --> 00:05:06.694]  You can't pass the buck.
[00:05:06.734 --> 00:05:08.775]  This is a personal decision.
[00:05:08.815 --> 00:05:11.036]  This is gut check time, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:12.037 --> 00:05:12.457]  That's right.
[00:05:12.817 --> 00:05:13.578]  And that's where we are.
[00:05:13.898 --> 00:05:16.319]  So we're everybody listening right now.
[00:05:16.579 --> 00:05:18.280]  At this time, there are things you can do.
[00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.881]  Now, some of you are saying, well, I'm old.
[00:05:19.961 --> 00:05:20.782]  I'm almost 70.
[00:05:20.822 --> 00:05:21.182]  Guess what?
[00:05:21.222 --> 00:05:22.062]  You can drive a truck.
[00:05:22.102 --> 00:05:22.823]  Congratulations.
[00:05:22.843 --> 00:05:23.743]  You can operate a radio.
[00:05:23.863 --> 00:05:24.624]  You can be a medic.
[00:05:25.217 --> 00:05:27.380]  You can help it with the administration.
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.642]  Life's going to have to go on while all of this is taking place.
[00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:33.687]  Congratulations, you can run information through enemy checkpoints.
[00:05:34.288 --> 00:05:34.708]  That's right.
[00:05:34.748 --> 00:05:37.972]  There's a hundred things that can be done to successfully defeat the enemy.
[00:05:37.992 --> 00:05:43.599]  They don't have enough bodies to do this without trying to puff everybody, puff the stuff up through the controlled media.
[00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:44.260]  Now here's the thing.
[00:05:44.904 --> 00:05:49.625]  What you just heard about in Chicago, we had the initial clippings on that as it came through.
[00:05:50.165 --> 00:05:53.906]  Remember, they're not sending these troops to Baghdad as originally planned.
[00:05:53.926 --> 00:05:55.687]  They're shipping them to Chicago.
[00:05:55.707 --> 00:05:58.947]  Hmm, major shift in operations.
[00:05:59.128 --> 00:06:02.248]  I've always said that's probably where they're going to hit with a false flag.
[00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:08.570]  And again, one of the issues here, the tie-in with all of this, Alex, is remember, the practice is overseas.
[00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.891]  What you see and everybody goes, oh yeah, they're doing it to the Iraqis, oh yeah, people.
[00:06:13.416 --> 00:06:28.873]  They gave FBI, ATF, prison guards, local cops leave of absence for a year to work as a mercenary over there for $100,000 tax-free so they could practice busting skulls and torturing people the way they'd like to have the goofs
[00:06:29.153 --> 00:06:30.053]  Do that over here.
[00:06:30.173 --> 00:06:31.214]  And that's not our opinion.
[00:06:31.274 --> 00:06:34.895]  We got White House and Rand Corporation and other white papers on that.
[00:06:35.115 --> 00:06:36.376]  And we've written articles about it.
[00:06:36.696 --> 00:06:38.597]  They admit this is the big prize.
[00:06:39.097 --> 00:06:43.038]  And they created the murderous cadres over there.
[00:06:43.418 --> 00:06:44.759]  And they found out who was good.
[00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:46.179]  And they go, oh, get your shot.
[00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:47.800]  You know, the doctor doesn't even know.
[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.861]  It's just a special shot for you where you get your soft kill weapon.
[00:06:51.101 --> 00:06:52.322]  You come back home and die.
[00:06:52.502 --> 00:06:58.084]  But the guys that said they'd torture and would torture and would run the 30 plus camps over there, they're all coming back here.
[00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:59.120]  That's right.
[00:06:59.301 --> 00:07:01.463]  And here again, people wonder, how can they do this?
[00:07:01.503 --> 00:07:03.005]  Well, this is the mechanism they've used.
[00:07:03.025 --> 00:07:08.410]  Now, there's a lot of good soldiers and a lot of good men and women right now, who are in uniform, who are listening.
[00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.973]  And you've got to decide to use one two-letter word.
[00:07:10.993 --> 00:07:11.033]  No!
[00:07:13.194 --> 00:07:24.023]  We are not going to let America slip into the Soviet Socialist mechanism that destroyed, that gutted both the work ethic, the economy, and the spirit of the Russian people.
[00:07:24.043 --> 00:07:29.588]  But the globalists are masters at stampeding even intellectual people, even folks that know what's going on.
[00:07:29.888 --> 00:07:37.915]  They see a nuke go off, they say the Al-Cieda did it, you've got to go do this, but then ask yourselves into the first week,
[00:07:38.235 --> 00:07:40.996]  Why are we confiscating guns around this city and other cities?
[00:07:41.537 --> 00:07:42.957]  Why are we going after the people?
[00:07:43.037 --> 00:07:44.658]  Why are there big arrest lists?
[00:07:45.218 --> 00:07:47.539]  At that point, you know who the terrorists were.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.701]  If there was ever any doubts, you know that, when they're attacking the wrong target.
[00:07:52.262 --> 00:07:53.742]  Well, a good interesting point.
[00:07:53.762 --> 00:08:05.508]  How many examples, think about it Alex, do we have on video and audio, where we were attacked with a plane, with guys with box cutters, and immediately the argument was, we need to confiscate the guns!
[00:08:06.855 --> 00:08:10.883]  Absolutely had nothing to do with firearms, had nothing to do with the American firearms owner.
[00:08:10.923 --> 00:08:15.751]  In fact, to be quite honest, if an American firearms owner had been on the plane with a smuggled gun...
[00:08:16.913 --> 00:08:23.154]  If we believe the story that they officially gave, it would have been pop-pop, pop-pop, oh you've got a box cutter too, pop-pop, there we go, game over.
[00:08:24.135 --> 00:08:35.797]  Plus, Mark, who believes in on planes with 50 plus men and women on average, it was about 55, so let's say half of those, you know, 26 or so are men.
[00:08:35.817 --> 00:08:40.518]  I mean, somebody pulls a box cutter on me and I don't claim to be Mr. Macho, I'm going to
[00:08:41.878 --> 00:08:42.899]  I'm going to beat the hell out of you!
[00:08:43.219 --> 00:08:46.281]  You got nothing to lose and everything to gain and you know something's going bad.
[00:08:46.562 --> 00:08:57.790]  And especially with understanding the history, this is why, in fact, even with the no-fly list, patriots are on the no-fly list for one reason, people, because American patriots would stop a hijacking.
[00:08:58.891 --> 00:09:01.793]  That's why American patriots are on the no-fly list.
[00:09:01.833 --> 00:09:10.039]  And when you look at Washington and you look at these goofs, understand, they hate the American patriot because they are globalist parasites.
[00:09:11.266 --> 00:09:20.009]  These parasites, these succubus, these vampire, who look just as pasty as you'd expect and just as goofy-eyed, look at the eyes of Bush.
[00:09:20.049 --> 00:09:21.250]  Look at the eyes of Gore.
[00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:24.091]  He looks like a ghoul!
[00:09:24.271 --> 00:09:27.092]  I mean, my mother says they both look like vampires.
[00:09:27.552 --> 00:09:28.212]  Yes, exactly.
[00:09:28.232 --> 00:09:29.953]  And they're looking worse every day.
[00:09:30.413 --> 00:09:33.955]  Or if you look at a shark, don't they look like that shark coming out of the murky water?
[00:09:34.055 --> 00:09:38.857]  As Don would say, he's been a diver for years, one of my other co-hosts, and a great guy.
[00:09:39.337 --> 00:09:40.038]  He was a diver.
[00:09:40.078 --> 00:09:41.038]  He's seen sharks come out.
[00:09:41.158 --> 00:09:46.660]  He said they look just like a combination of a parasitic vampire with the eyes of a shark.
[00:09:47.361 --> 00:09:48.741]  The bobble-headed eyes of a shark.
[00:09:49.582 --> 00:09:50.102]  Now, again,
[00:09:50.751 --> 00:09:51.952]  That's a minor point.
[00:09:51.992 --> 00:09:57.194]  They're so far away from the reality of the world and so far isolated that they're irrelevant, to be quite honest.
[00:09:57.214 --> 00:10:00.375]  They will be the ones who are going to press the button, so to speak.
[00:10:01.175 --> 00:10:04.096]  But it's you who are going to be the ground pounders on the line, people.
[00:10:04.156 --> 00:10:05.237]  We hold the real estate.
[00:10:05.357 --> 00:10:11.719]  Every person listening, if you're in Maine, Florida, Washington State, or Arizona, or California, people, you're standing on your country.
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:13.980]  This is our piece of real estate.
[00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:15.461]  Possession is nine-tenths of the law.
[00:10:15.661 --> 00:10:17.082]  Arm yourself now.
[00:10:17.842 --> 00:10:19.142]  You want to vote these people?
[00:10:19.182 --> 00:10:20.203]  Explain to them how you feel?
[00:10:20.845 --> 00:10:32.252]  Reach into your pocket, pull out a handful of change and a dollar bill and go right now when you go home or when you go to your lunch and buy 50 rounds of .22 ammo and make sure that you get it for a quote-unquote rifle.
[00:10:32.272 --> 00:10:33.452]  I always tell them, it's for a rifle.
[00:10:33.472 --> 00:10:34.573]  They always ask, but it's a pistol.
[00:10:34.593 --> 00:10:36.614]  You gotta put paperwork down in some states.
[00:10:37.275 --> 00:10:37.955]  It's for a rifle.
[00:10:38.655 --> 00:10:41.677]  But everybody, buy a 50-round box of ammo with pocket change.
[00:10:41.797 --> 00:10:42.798]  Vote with your wallet.
[00:10:43.118 --> 00:10:45.900]  Explain to them that's 50 more rounds that we'll have available.
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:50.042]  Doesn't mean it's anything fancy, but every one of you got pocket change to do that with.
[00:10:51.078 --> 00:11:00.367]  And every one of us, we need to be part of the deep, tactical reserve to develop the arms, equipment, and material necessary so we don't have to have supply lines.
[00:11:01.008 --> 00:11:11.018]  You can walk out to one of the militiamen standing there and literally hand him what he needs, because it'll be where it needs to be, not in a warehouse where they can roll the door shut and lock it.
[00:11:11.818 --> 00:11:14.260]  It needs to be spread across the whole of the country now.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.561]  It needs to be in our hands.
[00:11:15.661 --> 00:11:16.221]  And you know what?
[00:11:16.261 --> 00:11:18.603]  The first time they try something, oh well.
[00:11:18.883 --> 00:11:20.604]  You know, it's like the old John Lee movie.
[00:11:20.885 --> 00:11:31.873]  You know, I don't want this to happen, but if you study history, whether it's in reality in 1775 or whether it's in Viva Vendetta, they're just going to keep pushing and keep killing us until people fight back.
[00:11:32.373 --> 00:11:37.657]  And then it's going to turn into a melee and then everybody's going to see the guys in black uniforms like at Waco running
[00:11:38.237 --> 00:11:43.198]  But it's not going to be just one Waco, it's going to be hundreds, where they're running, and then it's over!
[00:11:43.678 --> 00:11:48.680]  And then they're going to bring in the foreign I-4 forces, as they've been conditioning everybody for.
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:55.961]  Mark Kornke is our guest, we're going to talk behind the scenes, right now for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, and InfoWars.com streamlisters.
[00:11:55.981 --> 00:11:57.282]  For everybody else, we'll be right back.
[00:11:57.922 --> 00:12:00.382]  Have you ever thought about... Okay, bring me Mark.
[00:12:00.422 --> 00:12:05.684]  Mark, I want to go back into that when we get back, but I want to spend time on this, because you talk about, see, we told you so.
[00:12:06.884 --> 00:12:08.766]  I mean, it's even moving faster than I thought.
[00:12:09.306 --> 00:12:32.205]  When they just come right out and say, let me just throw this out at you and get your take on it, and I'm going to come back and talk more, I'm going to spend a lot of time on this, and just kind of slip it in, oh, the National Guard is going to be helping fight all the guns in Chicago, they're going to help take them with the police, and then they have from Dallas to Tucson to, I mean, hundreds of cities, Oakland, DC, Boston, they're all announcing
[00:12:32.865 --> 00:12:38.067]  That they're coming to the door and saying, I want to search for your guns with no warrants.
[00:12:38.107 --> 00:12:39.828]  I mean, this is martial law, Mark.
[00:12:40.088 --> 00:12:45.911]  And then you got Obama talking about million man spy forces of teenagers.
[00:12:45.951 --> 00:12:50.132]  I mean, how can the public not know this is the gauntlet being thrown down?
[00:12:50.172 --> 00:12:52.913]  I mean, it looks like they're getting ready to move.
[00:12:53.394 --> 00:12:55.755]  Especially since, remember, we had all this information.
[00:12:55.795 --> 00:13:01.097]  And by the way, the first meeting where the proposal to use this one million man youth slash gang brigade
[00:13:01.792 --> 00:13:05.155]  The Slant Slash Gang Army was right there in Chicago.
[00:13:06.636 --> 00:13:15.443]  That was the first meeting where FinCEN and all of the other, well actually where FinCEN was created was right there in Chicago where its initial meeting took place in conjunction with all of the others.
[00:13:15.463 --> 00:13:15.963]  That was Bush Seniors!
[00:13:16.724 --> 00:13:30.835]  And remember that at that time, when they did it, that's where they brought up the whole idea of using the youth and the street gangs, putting them into uniform because they would be regimented, they already understand management, they would be thugs, they would be expendable,
[00:13:31.573 --> 00:13:34.216]  They were already incorporated into this an original note.
[00:13:34.276 --> 00:13:39.303]  In fact, they were both note and no-note meetings that took place in Chicago and then in Los Angeles and in Seattle.
[00:13:39.323 --> 00:13:40.124]  Alright, let me stop you.
[00:13:40.204 --> 00:13:40.664]  Let me stop you.
[00:13:40.685 --> 00:13:42.367]  When I come back, I want the full audience to hear that.
[00:13:42.387 --> 00:13:42.947]  It's too important.
[00:13:42.967 --> 00:13:44.830]  We're just the folks online.
[00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:45.771]  I just want everybody to hear it.
[00:13:46.592 --> 00:13:47.333]  But that's another thing.
[00:13:47.433 --> 00:13:49.876]  We all told them they'd hire felons and gang members.
[00:13:50.837 --> 00:13:57.979]  And then they're telling the public, oh, it's to fight them, but then if you read the news closely, they admit they're hiring illegal aliens, aggravated felons.
[00:13:57.999 --> 00:14:03.280]  I've seen that in the AP three years ago saying, oh, they really want foreigners who are also aggravated felons.
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:08.701]  I mean, that makes the government totally illegitimate right there, Mark.
[00:14:09.121 --> 00:14:09.661]  They're a criminal.
[00:14:09.781 --> 00:14:13.822]  Well, the other thing tied into that, remember, the reason they want the aggravated felons from overseas?
[00:14:14.682 --> 00:14:21.105]  Remember that the way that the, uh, Admiralty law works, they're property, they're not people.
[00:14:21.966 --> 00:14:27.629]  So therefore, they are bondsmen slash they are mercenary slaves.
[00:14:27.649 --> 00:14:29.330]  They're actually property of the state.
[00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:34.292]  That's what they're doing is they're coming in and surrendering time of their life in exchange for a benefit.
[00:14:35.253 --> 00:14:35.873]  That's what they're doing.
[00:14:35.893 --> 00:14:36.693]  That's why they want them.
[00:14:36.713 --> 00:14:43.457]  They're the preferred ones because they are absolutely owned as property by the state and they can also dispose of them just as quickly as they get hold of them.
[00:14:44.858 --> 00:15:06.206]  Good God, I mean, to see all of it being announced, to really know they're really going to do it, and that's why all the elitists are moving out of the country for the season, they think, while they run a black op, kill 50 million, a re-education, a great leap forward, a cultural revolution, a linen-mound Nazi purge, and they really are going to do it, Mark.
[00:15:06.226 --> 00:15:12.588]  I mean, I've always known they were planning it, but to really be alive, aren't you glad you're not behind the wire now to be able to
[00:15:13.348 --> 00:15:20.554]  Well, there's a whole bunch of people that are concerned that we've got to be keeping in mind and keeping in our prayers, too, for their reason.
[00:15:21.054 --> 00:15:24.456]  Because there are people inside that understood full well what this was.
[00:15:24.497 --> 00:15:27.979]  We saw it from even the... You even saw it from inside the system.
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:33.663]  There's bragging that goes up with the guard system, etc., and they didn't pull it out of their head.
[00:15:33.703 --> 00:15:37.126]  It's like when you have this character talk about how the Founding Fathers were terrorists.
[00:15:37.386 --> 00:15:38.347]  He didn't think that up.
[00:15:38.976 --> 00:15:44.422]  That came from some briefing with some goof who told him how he was going to be thinking when he taught all the rest of the group.
[00:15:44.442 --> 00:15:45.863]  Oh no, we have the slat manuals.
[00:15:45.883 --> 00:15:46.604]  That's a manual.
[00:15:47.105 --> 00:15:47.285]  Yep.
[00:15:47.565 --> 00:15:49.207]  We later got that from a federal marshal.
[00:15:49.547 --> 00:15:54.312]  Okay, we're going live right now, ladies and gentlemen, with the main transmission.
[00:15:54.332 --> 00:15:56.435]  I want to recap it into more detail right now.
[00:15:57.015 --> 00:15:58.176]  The gang member thugs.
[00:15:58.216 --> 00:15:58.497]  Here we go.
[00:16:14.417 --> 00:16:20.979]  So much going on, so much going on.
[00:16:21.059 --> 00:16:23.880]  So many things going on in the world.
[00:16:25.221 --> 00:16:30.763]  Babies dying, mothers crying.
[00:16:31.003 --> 00:16:34.144]  How much all this one human life worth.
[00:16:39.944 --> 00:16:43.347]  Well, good people stood down, so evil took over, and now there's no peace.
[00:16:45.208 --> 00:16:46.048]  Until they're defeated.
[00:16:50.231 --> 00:16:52.073]  Let's go ahead and go back to Mark Cornkey.
[00:16:52.113 --> 00:16:55.695]  Mark, we were getting into American Peril 1 and 2.
[00:16:55.755 --> 00:17:05.863]  You know, we're talking 15 years ago, you're laying out, they're going to hire street gangs, they're going to hire thugs, they're going to hire felons, people laughed at you, all the documents, all the sources.
[00:17:06.423 --> 00:17:09.304]  And then, in about 1999, it was in the news.
[00:17:09.744 --> 00:17:11.904]  And now I've got all these mainstream publications.
[00:17:11.984 --> 00:17:12.825]  It's in my films.
[00:17:13.545 --> 00:17:24.388]  We've posted it on Prison Planet and Infowars.com, where they say, we're not just hiring foreigners from Venezuela, Nicaragua, Panama, the former death squads in the U.S.
[00:17:24.428 --> 00:17:25.648]  and Mexican military.
[00:17:25.688 --> 00:17:26.848]  We told you that three years ago.
[00:17:27.188 --> 00:17:28.369]  Now it's been in Texas News.
[00:17:28.409 --> 00:17:31.149]  They work for the CIA and are killing rival drug dealers.
[00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:32.850]  So Mexican paramilitary
[00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:39.875]  Now they're announcing that the biggest army recruiting station is in Mexico City, the Philippines.
[00:17:39.915 --> 00:17:41.075]  They're hiring criminals.
[00:17:42.356 --> 00:17:44.518]  They report they want aggravated felons.
[00:17:44.558 --> 00:17:45.739]  That means rape, arson.
[00:17:46.479 --> 00:17:49.241]  It listed that in the news, and they just said it's good.
[00:17:49.261 --> 00:17:52.824]  I mean, that is one of the most classic signs of tyranny.
[00:17:52.884 --> 00:17:55.305]  Not just armed spy youth brigades.
[00:17:55.926 --> 00:18:02.671]  And Mark, you were telling us behind the scenes there for the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, and I remember you reporting this ten, twelve, fourteen years ago,
[00:18:03.391 --> 00:18:09.053]  That the first meeting for FinCEN was in Chicago, where that was proposed.
[00:18:09.213 --> 00:18:10.314]  Lay this out for people.
[00:18:10.854 --> 00:18:21.958]  Originally in Chicago, and this was in fact in 1993 and 1994, FinCEN was an unknown entity outside of a very narrow band of alphabet soup agencies.
[00:18:22.859 --> 00:18:28.401]  They met in Chicago, and 56 specific agencies and police organizations met with them.
[00:18:29.113 --> 00:18:39.216]  And what they did is mapped out how to expand the MJTF and JTF forces, Multi-Jurisdictional Task Forces, and Joint Task Force operations.
[00:18:39.976 --> 00:18:51.179]  But during these meetings, which were both note and no-note briefings, all of these men sucked in the air when they flat-out said that what they were proposing is to create... Oh, and where did we just hear this?
[00:18:51.199 --> 00:18:52.920]  With Osama bin Laden and the chipmunks?
[00:18:53.892 --> 00:18:59.020]  A multi-jurisdictional task force built up using the street gangs.
[00:18:59.180 --> 00:18:59.821]  And the reason?
[00:19:00.362 --> 00:19:01.404]  Well, guys, think about it.
[00:19:01.444 --> 00:19:03.046]  The street gangs are already regimented.
[00:19:03.066 --> 00:19:04.989]  The street gangs already have a command structure.
[00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:08.054]  They already understand how to use, you know, units of organization.
[00:19:09.011 --> 00:19:12.476]  They could arm them, equip them, and then use them as a shock force.
[00:19:24.931 --> 00:19:37.896]  DEA, and now he's been set up and arrested like Mark was, and this is a police officer, army veteran, sniper, Vietnam, no criminal record, raided his house for some firearms, going to prison basically, we tried to raise him some money.
[00:19:38.496 --> 00:19:46.799]  And it was all because he basically went on air and on TV in Texas and explained that they were hiring death squads and using Mexican troops to kill U.S.
[00:19:46.819 --> 00:19:47.239]  citizens.
[00:19:47.399 --> 00:19:49.180]  Now it's in the mainstream news.
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:50.741]  Think of the insanity.
[00:19:50.801 --> 00:19:51.341]  Mark, go ahead.
[00:19:51.861 --> 00:19:58.266]  Well, another thing that's tied in with this is remember that, uh, when now we're talking about this Million Man Youth Brigade, remember the Clintonistas?
[00:19:58.286 --> 00:20:08.755]  There's a picture you might have laying around people that we, uh, was in the AP, showing, uh, the characters doing the double-handed, uh, basically a salute, like they were bowing to the Emperor.
[00:20:09.495 --> 00:20:12.718]  And one kid standing there, and he's looking like, what the hell is this?
[00:20:12.818 --> 00:20:18.643]  And there's one, and the interesting thing is, Hillary's looking right at him like, yeah, I see you, you're not saluting like the rest.
[00:20:19.028 --> 00:20:24.990]  Bill's sitting there clapping and laughing while they're doing this, and it was a repeat, you know, like, uh, basically, uh, to the demagogue.
[00:20:25.311 --> 00:20:25.651]  Okay?
[00:20:26.311 --> 00:20:27.812]  Well, that's where they're going with this.
[00:20:27.852 --> 00:20:33.134]  Now, those kids are already grown up and have gotten into some other part of the bureaucracy, I'm sure, because they were chosen for being bobbleheads.
[00:20:33.814 --> 00:20:45.579]  This latest situation now, in line with the, for instance, using also the felon, the aggravated felons, remember that under Admiralty Law, they perceive anybody who has been charged as property.
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:50.102]  Under a United States Code, but also International Admiralty Law.
[00:20:50.703 --> 00:20:55.666]  So by them signing them into a military element like this, they become property.
[00:20:56.566 --> 00:21:01.829]  They're under contract, that's a word all you in the military understand, and the police, you understand, contract.
[00:21:01.889 --> 00:21:04.351]  I'm under contract for four years, or six years, or whatever.
[00:21:05.051 --> 00:21:05.832]  Well, guess what?
[00:21:05.952 --> 00:21:09.274]  They're gonna do, they're doing the same thing, but this is an indentureship.
[00:21:10.069 --> 00:21:12.771]  The advantage of using these spellings is that they already have.
[00:21:12.811 --> 00:21:20.497]  Remember, like the CIA, like DEA, like all these alphabet agencies, and intelligence operations, what they do is they need to pollute you.
[00:21:20.557 --> 00:21:26.242]  They need to get to a fork in the road and get you to do the wrong thing so they have something hanging over your head like the Sword of Damocles.
[00:21:27.156 --> 00:21:28.997]  What they're doing with these guys, same thing.
[00:21:29.758 --> 00:21:33.620]  Alex, they bring them in, and they can also get rid of them just as quick when they're done with them.
[00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:35.001]  And I don't want to hear laughing.
[00:21:35.281 --> 00:21:38.383]  We told you this for decades, now it's mainstream news.
[00:21:39.183 --> 00:21:40.844]  We were right, you were wrong.
[00:21:41.165 --> 00:21:42.846]  Join the battle for the Republic.
[00:21:43.166 --> 00:21:45.507]  Join the Sons of Liberty against tyranny.
[00:21:45.787 --> 00:21:47.268]  Make your choice now.
[00:21:48.309 --> 00:21:49.009]  We're on the march.
[00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:50.070]  I keep talking behind the scenes.
[00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:50.410]  The Empire.
[00:21:51.291 --> 00:21:52.312]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:52.372 --> 00:21:54.153]  Mark, I mean,
[00:21:54.915 --> 00:22:00.520]  I want to get into Ron Paul when we get back, read some of this and get your take on it, but continue with this.
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.221]  Challenging people.
[00:22:02.822 --> 00:22:05.504]  You know, the Sons of Liberty started up in what?
[00:22:05.984 --> 00:22:17.574]  Officially in 1763, but really a decade before that because of corruption and governors stealing things and the local constabulary raping people's wives and things.
[00:22:18.354 --> 00:22:38.940]  And within just a few years, the British had to send in troops, because the people quit supporting the establishment, the people started boycotting anybody that supported it, and they started then getting, sabotaging some things, doing passive-aggressive things, banner hanging, painting thugs' houses, you know, kind of...
[00:22:39.867 --> 00:22:45.949]  Fraternity type stuff, but very effective media stunts showing the locals weren't invincible.
[00:22:46.229 --> 00:22:48.290]  Showing the local enforcers weren't God.
[00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:52.532]  It's important to show people that they're a bunch of weak scum, isn't it?
[00:22:52.732 --> 00:22:54.432]  Because the public still thinks they're invincible.
[00:22:54.892 --> 00:22:57.433]  Well, one of the things to do is, like we said, everybody needs to.
[00:22:57.453 --> 00:23:05.056]  The next time there's a line for a bank, especially where they're trying to get in and they can't, we need to have a whole bunch of people walking down there with DVDs, CDs, paperwork.
[00:23:05.689 --> 00:23:09.873]  And handed over how to plug into programming that's independent, because here's what's really going on.
[00:23:10.053 --> 00:23:10.793]  You got fooled.
[00:23:10.853 --> 00:23:11.954]  You won't get burned again.
[00:23:12.735 --> 00:23:20.802]  And that's critical from the one direction, because there's a whole army of people that, as long as we hit them on the peak, they're going to be thinking now.
[00:23:20.942 --> 00:23:29.709]  And just like men I knew for 40 and 50 years never trusted a bank since the Depression, because they were burned then, and they would repeat in a bitter voice,
[00:23:30.532 --> 00:23:32.773]  You know, I would never use a bank in my life.
[00:23:32.793 --> 00:23:33.613]  I don't trust them.
[00:23:33.673 --> 00:23:34.533]  I know what they'll do.
[00:23:34.553 --> 00:23:35.233]  They destroyed me.
[00:23:35.253 --> 00:23:37.054]  They always make fun of old-timers.
[00:23:37.074 --> 00:23:39.454]  You all are dead now, but all the World War II vets and others.
[00:23:39.734 --> 00:23:45.056]  That nut, when he died, you know, he had syrup buckets with gold in the backyard and cash in the walls.
[00:23:45.336 --> 00:23:53.078]  Yeah, and he also, you know, from nothing, you know, running a carpentry business, owned all these houses and all these lands and took care of all his family from nothing out of the Depression.
[00:23:53.458 --> 00:23:54.478]  Oh, that guy's an idiot.
[00:23:54.518 --> 00:23:56.278]  He, you know, he owns a company and is successful.
[00:23:56.558 --> 00:23:58.539]  You know, let's be modern idiots all in debt.
[00:23:59.306 --> 00:24:12.292]  Right, and in fact it's interesting that that is a complete turn upon its head, the basic premise that kept us free for as long as it did, by understanding that we had to preserve and save if we were going to be free and maintain our liberties.
[00:24:12.352 --> 00:24:14.292]  And for those... They know this.
[00:24:15.093 --> 00:24:18.074]  The key to this whole thing is to understand, ignoring everything else,
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:24.562]  This is an attack upon our liberty and our lifetime because our lifetime is ours.
[00:24:24.722 --> 00:24:27.564]  Let's explain that when we get back and get into the cashless grid.
[00:24:27.824 --> 00:24:30.505]  Because a cashless grid means you can't escape it.
[00:24:30.825 --> 00:24:35.367]  And that's why they're gearing up with huge bureaucracies to block barter, block communities.
[00:24:35.427 --> 00:24:36.167]  You want to beat them?
[00:24:36.507 --> 00:24:37.168]  Start barter.
[00:24:37.208 --> 00:24:37.868]  Start communities.
[00:24:38.348 --> 00:24:45.930]  Start a little community garden, get to know your neighbors, stop watching television, have a party over with your neighbors, you know, and then pop a DVD in.
[00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:47.711]  It's a cultural shift.
[00:24:47.971 --> 00:24:49.411]  That's how we're going to beat these bastards.
[00:24:49.451 --> 00:24:49.911]  Right, Mark?
[00:24:50.371 --> 00:24:51.192]  Yep, exactly.
[00:24:51.412 --> 00:24:55.473]  It's going to have to be the people deciding, well, again, the power's going to be going off.
[00:24:55.513 --> 00:25:00.374]  You won't be watching a whole lot of television, which is one of the reasons I see that they can't afford to shut the power off.
[00:25:00.454 --> 00:25:01.895]  All right, here we go.
[00:25:02.115 --> 00:25:02.715]  Absolutely, here we go.
[00:25:09.116 --> 00:25:12.180]  You can run on for a long time.
[00:25:12.781 --> 00:25:15.084]  Run on for a long time.
[00:25:15.144 --> 00:25:17.847]  Run on for a long time.
[00:25:18.548 --> 00:25:21.031]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[00:25:21.552 --> 00:25:23.955]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[00:25:26.147 --> 00:25:32.989]  Why do you think tyrants and thugs and corrupt governments always try to mass up militarized police and prisons?
[00:25:45.458 --> 00:25:47.841]  Because the wicked fleeth when none pursueth.
[00:25:48.442 --> 00:25:56.332]  And then they always push and drive people into resisting them in their attempt to fully dominate you.
[00:25:56.632 --> 00:25:58.174]  Because they know they're bad.
[00:25:58.235 --> 00:26:02.320]  They are cowardly, horrible people who hate seeing others do well.
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.562]  Who hates seeing you being healthy and happy.
[00:26:05.042 --> 00:26:14.129]  They're not just trying to kill you with bioweapons and the food and vaccines and water and chemical weapons and cancer viruses and the shots because they want to save the earth.
[00:26:14.189 --> 00:26:15.950]  It's because they like hurting good people.
[00:26:16.151 --> 00:26:17.351]  They like hurting beauty.
[00:26:17.592 --> 00:26:19.193]  They like death and destruction.
[00:26:19.233 --> 00:26:21.475]  These are sick, twisted filth.
[00:26:22.435 --> 00:26:32.083]  Mark, we were talking behind the scenes there about how they need to keep the television there to keep people mesmerized in that dream state, not aware of what's going on.
[00:26:33.328 --> 00:26:35.430]  Look at what just happened here with digital television.
[00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:38.632]  You'll remember three years ago they said you will get one no matter what.
[00:26:38.752 --> 00:26:39.233]  What happened?
[00:26:39.253 --> 00:26:40.113]  They had to extend the date.
[00:26:40.193 --> 00:26:40.474]  Why?
[00:26:40.854 --> 00:26:43.296]  Because the economy was already soft and we all knew it.
[00:26:43.996 --> 00:26:46.999]  But what they did is they said, okay, well we'll bring the price down.
[00:26:47.179 --> 00:26:48.600]  They set another deadline.
[00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:49.161]  It failed.
[00:26:49.541 --> 00:26:51.482]  But they didn't shut the television off, did they?
[00:26:52.403 --> 00:26:53.004]  You notice that?
[00:26:53.104 --> 00:26:55.606]  They kept, oh wait a minute, no, we need to have you on this.
[00:26:56.026 --> 00:26:57.727]  So what they did is they extended it again.
[00:26:57.807 --> 00:26:59.769]  Right now, now they're talking, what's happening?
[00:27:00.239 --> 00:27:06.441]  They're talking about government actually subsidizing, giving you money to put a little box on your machine.
[00:27:06.461 --> 00:27:07.081]  They're already doing it.
[00:27:07.401 --> 00:27:08.341]  Yeah, think about this.
[00:27:08.461 --> 00:27:09.202]  Why did they do that?
[00:27:09.262 --> 00:27:15.764]  Why didn't they just, because they told you with an iron fist, we're in control, you either do this or we're going to threaten to shut you off.
[00:27:16.524 --> 00:27:20.705]  They can't afford to do that because it's one of the several boob tube tools that they use.
[00:27:21.092 --> 00:27:32.817]  The movie tools that they've been using with the, you know, Survivor series, excuse me, teaching you how to do the exact opposite of what you would be doing if all of you were in a situation where you were on your own and had to take care of your people.
[00:27:33.477 --> 00:27:34.197]  Just the reverse.
[00:27:34.257 --> 00:27:37.318]  The executive letter opener crowd takes over a survival situation.
[00:27:37.359 --> 00:27:42.120]  First one I would pop is anybody who was stupid enough to be following the guidelines of that goofiness.
[00:27:43.001 --> 00:27:48.343]  Because you'll notice in every one of those series, the first person they get rid of is the person who knows what they're doing.
[00:27:50.179 --> 00:27:51.400]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:27:51.581 --> 00:27:59.231]  All those big shows that the social engineers put out by design and pushed until they were picked up and began to be popular and profitable.
[00:28:00.728 --> 00:28:11.455]  It shows you destroy the smartest, destroy the best, get rid of them first, so that you can make it to the end, which is the opposite of how ten people would survive by working together.
[00:28:11.695 --> 00:28:19.099]  They're training us to see all of us as competing with each other, so we pull each other down like a bunch of crabs in the bottom of a bucket.
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:24.463]  Instead of together working as one, and this is what has always been, this is the issue of liberty.
[00:28:24.543 --> 00:28:25.723]  Liberty is what they're attacking.
[00:28:26.364 --> 00:28:29.806]  Our liberty is a treasure that is unlimited.
[00:28:30.447 --> 00:28:31.908]  With it, we can reach the stars.
[00:28:32.228 --> 00:28:39.390]  Without that liberty, we have to first cut the chains off of our ankles and off of our wrists in order for us to move.
[00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:42.511]  It's like swimming with a bowling ball tied to your leg.
[00:28:42.831 --> 00:28:43.291]  That's right.
[00:28:43.311 --> 00:28:44.172]  It don't work too well.
[00:28:44.212 --> 00:28:48.473]  In fact, you can do it for a while, but eventually the bowling ball starts to pull you down.
[00:28:49.233 --> 00:28:50.074]  And the same is true.
[00:28:50.134 --> 00:28:56.156]  In fact, you'll see a progressive destruction of civilization, as has been the case, if we allow these creatures to proceed.
[00:28:56.196 --> 00:28:56.996]  But we don't need to.
[00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:00.823]  They are not all-powerful, and I'll give you a point real quick.
[00:29:00.863 --> 00:29:02.264]  I'm gonna rub this in tactically.
[00:29:03.085 --> 00:29:04.766]  The bat faggots at Waco attacked once.
[00:29:05.046 --> 00:29:09.450]  Okay, right off the bat, shot Koresh, shot the other man in the front door, shot him in the abdomen, and they fall back.
[00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:11.432]  Killed, tried to kill every man, woman, and child.
[00:29:12.272 --> 00:29:16.456]  All they wanted to know when that guy called in with a 911 number was, where's the guy with the phone?
[00:29:16.476 --> 00:29:17.277]  Where's the guy with the phone?
[00:29:17.297 --> 00:29:20.739]  So they attacked a second time, while the dispatcher lied to the people inside.
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:22.281]  Oh no, they're not making a move!
[00:29:22.601 --> 00:29:24.743]  Then he turns around and says, are you making your move?
[00:29:25.723 --> 00:29:27.404]  Now, they attack a second time.
[00:29:27.424 --> 00:29:32.748]  They get beat back by grandmas, grandpas, women, and a handful of men my age and younger.
[00:29:33.429 --> 00:29:34.109]  A handful!
[00:29:34.249 --> 00:29:39.313]  The savages attacked when only grandpa and grandma and the women and the kids were there for the most part, guys.
[00:29:39.353 --> 00:29:39.933]  They're cowards.
[00:29:40.574 --> 00:29:41.314]  But here's the thing.
[00:29:41.935 --> 00:29:45.638]  Grandma and grandpa and the women and a handful of men stomped on their hind end.
[00:29:45.658 --> 00:29:46.979]  So they attacked a third time.
[00:29:47.039 --> 00:29:48.199]  And they didn't want to negotiate.
[00:29:48.219 --> 00:29:49.060]  They didn't want to talk.
[00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:50.101]  They wanted to murder.
[00:29:51.578 --> 00:30:06.546]  And by the way, at the time we told you that Israelis, French, British, and Russians were there, we were laughed at, and then later Newsweek said, oh yeah, they had microwave guns, sound cannons, other secret white noise devices, and foreign troops helped kill Americans.
[00:30:06.926 --> 00:30:07.626]  Ha ha ha!
[00:30:08.047 --> 00:30:18.232]  I mean, it was like a giant cookout, and then they posed with skulls and posed with the American flag as the building was burning, when really they were burning the soul of the American flag.
[00:30:18.732 --> 00:30:23.094]  Now, to the first day here, the third attack failed and the Batfaggots all fell back.
[00:30:23.454 --> 00:30:25.515]  Do you want to know why they wanted to negotiate people?
[00:30:26.155 --> 00:30:36.060]  Because between the hundred or so combat troops they had in their spiffy little black uniforms, they had less than 40 rounds between all of them left.
[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:38.681]  The Davidians were nice people.
[00:30:38.821 --> 00:30:40.242]  You had better learn something.
[00:30:40.602 --> 00:30:47.345]  When the enemy wants to negotiate, shoot the negotiator and hunt the rest of them down because they're out of ammo.
[00:30:49.215 --> 00:30:50.036]  That's how it works.
[00:30:50.056 --> 00:30:55.559]  Do you realize the Branch Davidians would have captured every camera on the ground that showed who shot first?
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:57.580]  Every film disappeared.
[00:30:57.701 --> 00:31:03.604]  Watch the Waco Rules of Engagement and look at how many cameras were running that the Batfaggots had.
[00:31:03.925 --> 00:31:05.005]  They bragged about it.
[00:31:05.506 --> 00:31:10.629]  But when they all had to retreat, all the film disappeared and it was never found.
[00:31:10.729 --> 00:31:11.089]  Why?
[00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:15.212]  Because it shows beyond a shadow of a doubt that the Batfaggots shot first.
[00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:27.589]  But it later came out in documents that they did shoot first and wanted to massacre them to then say, look, we killed a cult, we need more funding, and the video did get leaked of them loading the cameras saying, this is going to get us a lot of funding.
[00:31:28.329 --> 00:31:28.870]  That's right.
[00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:30.031]  Now here's the thing, though.
[00:31:30.051 --> 00:31:36.996]  The point is, they only want to negotiate once they realize that their hind end, their old mammary gland was in the ringer, okay?
[00:31:37.016 --> 00:31:37.637]  There's another term.
[00:31:37.657 --> 00:31:38.878]  We'll be polite.
[00:31:39.478 --> 00:31:40.619]  The point is this, people.
[00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:42.681]  They aren't carrying enough ammo to win.
[00:31:43.616 --> 00:31:46.618]  And old people are going to say, oh, but they have tanks and they have this and they have that.
[00:31:46.638 --> 00:31:47.978]  Let me point something out real quick.
[00:31:48.699 --> 00:31:54.882]  The Israelis went into Lebanon with a class AA military force against leg infantry militia that had one thing.
[00:31:55.302 --> 00:31:56.583]  They had spirit.
[00:31:57.267 --> 00:32:01.249]  They didn't have Air Force, they didn't have helicopters, they didn't have spy satellites.
[00:32:01.289 --> 00:32:03.030]  They had guts and guts was enough.
[00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:13.955]  And yet what they did is they used an effective checkerboard defense and dealt with and neutralized a class AA combined arms army with all the bells and whistles.
[00:32:14.836 --> 00:32:21.879]  So they don't want to dwell on it or talk about it because you're supposed to believe like the boar gets futile to resist, you will be absorbed blasé splee.
[00:32:22.386 --> 00:32:23.206]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[00:32:23.626 --> 00:32:24.807]  All flesh dies.
[00:32:25.007 --> 00:32:27.568]  And they, we need to send them to hell first.
[00:32:28.448 --> 00:32:29.689]  That's how it works.
[00:32:29.769 --> 00:32:30.909]  As long as you understand that.
[00:32:31.009 --> 00:32:39.332]  All you combat veterans out there, you soldiers, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and even Desert Dust 1 and 2, y'all know that here's how it works.
[00:32:39.753 --> 00:32:41.793]  At a given point, you're fearful of death.
[00:32:42.314 --> 00:32:46.495]  But then eventually you realize, seeing enough of it, that, well, if it's my time, it's my time.
[00:32:46.535 --> 00:32:51.017]  And when you throw that fear down, it doesn't mean that you don't try to keep yourself alive.
[00:32:51.545 --> 00:32:57.950]  It's when you concentrate on the job and put them in the ground first that you find you will probably make it.
[00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:04.155]  Now, Hezbollah, and there's a term nobody wants to talk about, in Lebanon, what they did is they all agreed we fight to the death.
[00:33:04.735 --> 00:33:05.916]  And they, you know what's funny?
[00:33:06.296 --> 00:33:07.737]  They agreed to that, and guess what?
[00:33:07.917 --> 00:33:09.819]  Most of them didn't have to fight to the death.
[00:33:09.919 --> 00:33:12.641]  They survived the battle and they won.
[00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:19.395]  You realize what kind of a high that is, people, to actually face armor, artillery, aircraft, and helicopters?
[00:33:19.415 --> 00:33:22.077]  Oh, they fought super tanks with more armor than the Abrams.
[00:33:22.537 --> 00:33:24.218]  That's right, and look what happened.
[00:33:24.499 --> 00:33:29.422]  They didn't, the bad guys didn't even reach their first primary objective.
[00:33:30.623 --> 00:33:31.484]  Think about that.
[00:33:32.064 --> 00:33:34.326]  They didn't even reach their first primary objective.
[00:33:34.386 --> 00:33:40.391]  And by the way, it was photographed, even by the mainstream media, they were even using nerve gas artillery, and that didn't even help them.
[00:33:40.939 --> 00:33:41.339]  That's right.
[00:33:41.399 --> 00:33:42.179]  Now, here's another thing.
[00:33:42.219 --> 00:33:43.920]  Thank you very much for bringing it up, Alex.
[00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:47.900]  I'm going to repeat this, because Mark, everybody knows Mark's a fanatic on this, and I'm not a fanatic.
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:51.661]  I was an NBC instructor, nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare instructor.
[00:33:52.301 --> 00:33:54.901]  You all need a gas mask now.
[00:33:55.642 --> 00:34:00.022]  You all need a gas mask, and preferably a chem suit, now.
[00:34:00.202 --> 00:34:00.502]  Why?
[00:34:00.902 --> 00:34:04.643]  Because it's an insurance policy, and someone's going to say, well, it's not state-of-the-art.
[00:34:04.703 --> 00:34:05.103]  Guess what?
[00:34:05.183 --> 00:34:07.564]  You have $4,000 to spend on state-of-the-art.
[00:34:07.604 --> 00:34:08.764]  If you do, congratulations.
[00:34:08.804 --> 00:34:09.564]  Go for it, puppy.
[00:34:10.325 --> 00:34:16.590]  If not, you get what you can afford, and you upgrade progressively by taking it right off the face of the sucker that's coming at ya.
[00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:32.041]  I only need 15 minutes if that's all my filter would work, and trust me, I'll have the- I'll have whatever that puppy's coming across with, plus, ch-ch-ch, I'm gonna have his weapon, ba-dop, I'm gonna have his toys, ba-dop, and by the way, if I'm hungry, I'll pull the food out of his mouth, cause I know it's safe.
[00:34:33.447 --> 00:34:35.548]  That is the attitude all of you have got to have.
[00:34:35.588 --> 00:34:37.129]  We are going to gut the enemy.
[00:34:37.169 --> 00:34:40.271]  If you don't think that way, they plan on gutting your country.
[00:34:40.351 --> 00:34:41.132]  Look what's happening.
[00:34:41.152 --> 00:34:42.673]  You guys are down there in Texas.
[00:34:42.893 --> 00:34:43.753]  And I want to be straight up.
[00:34:43.793 --> 00:34:55.461]  When the enemy attacks you folks, and they do it every day, they rape your children, they torture them, but these are waddling pedophile scum and then basically low-grade morons that are too stupid to think they're on the good guy's team.
[00:34:55.921 --> 00:34:59.803]  I mean, we've got the thinkers, and Mark, they've got the... They've got the stinkers.
[00:35:00.223 --> 00:35:00.664]  That's right.
[00:35:00.744 --> 00:35:02.565]  And you know the thing, the most important thing is this.
[00:35:03.064 --> 00:35:04.587]  It's not that we are starting this.
[00:35:04.767 --> 00:35:06.109]  My God, people, look around.
[00:35:06.149 --> 00:35:08.834]  You're living at your... Your battlefield is your home now.
[00:35:10.056 --> 00:35:12.179]  Everybody said, we'll fight them when they're over... No, you're not.
[00:35:12.239 --> 00:35:13.221]  We'll let them hit the beach.
[00:35:14.676 --> 00:35:15.857]  They've landed on the beach.
[00:35:15.957 --> 00:35:17.097]  They're all through the country.
[00:35:17.137 --> 00:35:19.658]  They plan on raping, killing, pillaging, and burning.
[00:35:19.678 --> 00:35:25.061]  MIT admits that the camera system was designed by the Pentagon 15 years ago in place tracking us, the enemy.
[00:35:25.541 --> 00:35:29.743]  NORTHCOM admits we are under a military rule and that we are seen as an enemy force.
[00:35:30.684 --> 00:35:34.766]  The American people have had war declared on them by a criminal, rogue government.
[00:35:35.563 --> 00:35:36.863]  Let's tie this in real quick, guys.
[00:35:37.584 --> 00:35:41.185]  Alex, you saw the picture of the North Com General signing with the Canadian, right?
[00:35:41.765 --> 00:35:44.366]  And they announced that it is a force against the American people.
[00:35:44.446 --> 00:35:48.207]  It shocked everybody, but we already told you they signed agreements a decade ago.
[00:35:48.567 --> 00:35:52.828]  For all of you Americans out there listening, what general officer has any authority
[00:35:53.408 --> 00:36:00.070]  To sign any agreement with a foreign power, and to do so... By the way, Congress had to pass a resolution saying they couldn't do that.
[00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:02.190]  The military just said, you don't run, Jack!
[00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:06.671]  Just like PDD 51 Bush signed, says Congress isn't involved in government anymore.
[00:36:07.291 --> 00:36:14.633]  And yet, every American listening right now who might be listening for the first time would say, well, wait a minute, says the civil government, you know, they have the authority.
[00:36:14.973 --> 00:36:22.775]  And I will go back again, go to NORTHCOM, and look, you've got a general sitting there, swapping spit with a Canadian UN officer, and you better rub this in, people.
[00:36:23.321 --> 00:36:25.092]  Canada is a UN prostitute.
[00:36:25.928 --> 00:36:27.709]  They already work for the UN.
[00:36:27.749 --> 00:36:29.871]  They've been busted several times for torture.
[00:36:30.431 --> 00:36:34.314]  They just signed an agreement to bring Canadian forces into the United States.
[00:36:55.828 --> 00:36:56.629]  He's flying them out.
[00:36:56.869 --> 00:36:58.551]  Mark, here's the thing about that.
[00:36:58.911 --> 00:37:13.384]  When you look at Time Magazine, Newsweek, and all the others, for instance, the Canadians in the Caribbean or the Canadians in North Africa, every time they take a picture, you'll notice they look at the ground, they turn away, they cover their face, they grab something like they're drinking.
[00:37:13.925 --> 00:37:16.687]  Every person in the picture is trying to hide their face.
[00:37:17.368 --> 00:37:19.550]  Those are criminals.
[00:37:20.171 --> 00:37:25.879]  They want to bring, now here's the thing too, the thing about poetic long-term, this is their idea for vendetta.
[00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:37.394]  Most Canadians are nice people, but there's a bunch of Canadians who have a vendetta against our liberated country because we deported them to Canada from the colonies.
[00:37:38.621 --> 00:37:40.702]  We kicked the Tories out of this country.
[00:37:40.802 --> 00:37:44.684]  We didn't want them back in, so we didn't re-invade Canada to make Canada proud.
[00:37:44.704 --> 00:37:45.104]  That's right.
[00:37:45.224 --> 00:37:47.505]  Ethan Allen made sure we took their property, too.
[00:37:48.206 --> 00:37:52.928]  And the thing is, keep this in mind, those Canadians that are up there, that are with the UN forces,
[00:37:53.362 --> 00:37:57.505]  I think that this is a revenge act, and for people to say, well, that was 200 years ago.
[00:37:57.966 --> 00:38:02.109]  Back in 1995, you had a whole string of Canadians... Well, let me stop you, Mark.
[00:38:02.169 --> 00:38:07.334]  When I was up there for 15 hours being interrogated, they let me know they hate America and George Washington.
[00:38:07.354 --> 00:38:08.014]  But go ahead.
[00:38:08.535 --> 00:38:08.915]  Exactly.
[00:38:08.935 --> 00:38:14.820]  Well, the point is that the Canadians, back in the... after we talked about this on the air, about the whole idea about Canadians being deported,
[00:38:15.678 --> 00:38:27.424]  A bunch of the Kosher Mafia lawyers got together, ADL Lawyers got together with a bunch of Canadians and filed a lawsuit against the United States for war reparations from the Revolutionary War because of the deportees that we sent to Canada.
[00:38:27.764 --> 00:38:31.647]  Now, unlike what the Soviets do, the Socialists do, here's the thing.
[00:38:32.667 --> 00:38:39.951]  The American Revolution, unlike Communist Russia or Germany or Japan or China, we didn't kill all of the opposition off.
[00:38:40.131 --> 00:38:43.853]  We told them, pack your bags, you got 90 days, leave this country in peace.
[00:38:44.833 --> 00:38:51.037]  That's the difference between our revolution and like the French Revolution with the Jacobins and the guillotines and the nutcases.
[00:38:51.558 --> 00:38:55.501]  The difference between the American Revolution is it was justice tempered with mercy.
[00:38:55.981 --> 00:38:59.283]  Now I will say this, I understand I have to fight.
[00:38:59.784 --> 00:39:03.006]  I will not let my enemy take me into the gutter with him.
[00:39:03.646 --> 00:39:08.150]  We must maintain a standard and an ideal even as we kick the slats off of them.
[00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:10.171]  We will act in a specific way.
[00:39:10.431 --> 00:39:12.533]  We are men and women of the West.
[00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:20.432]  We are not the vagabonds and scallywags that we see in the Middle East, that we see over, you know, with all of these socialist states.
[00:39:20.932 --> 00:39:22.112]  Granted, they've tried to do this.
[00:39:22.152 --> 00:39:29.193]  They've got a million people they think they're going to recruit to make a little youth corps, you know, KGB-type interior police, on top of what we already have.
[00:39:29.233 --> 00:39:30.854]  By the way, Mark, that's the incredible thing.
[00:39:30.894 --> 00:39:34.855]  They said in, let me find the actual NBC News article.
[00:39:35.075 --> 00:39:35.675]  I've got it here.
[00:39:36.874 --> 00:39:37.774]  That's what they said.
[00:39:37.854 --> 00:39:44.856]  They said civilian national security force to collect intelligence and then it's going to be an armed force.
[00:39:45.716 --> 00:39:49.577]  Well, that's in line with the whole idea that what they're doing is going right down the checklist.
[00:39:49.638 --> 00:39:52.398]  Remember what happened here in the United States or the colonies.
[00:39:52.478 --> 00:39:54.599]  That's like the GRU, isn't it?
[00:39:54.619 --> 00:39:57.600]  Well, the GRU combined with mostly the Interior Police.
[00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:02.241]  In fact, it's a magic number, this million or first 100,000 for the core of the Interior Police.
[00:40:02.842 --> 00:40:09.283]  A million-man dispersion force, which would be attached to the Interior Police, which were used as stunt dummies.
[00:40:09.303 --> 00:40:11.264]  They were up the front line, take the bullet first.
[00:40:11.684 --> 00:40:21.186]  But they were also, obviously, the on-the-ground intelligence collectors in Yugoslavia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, all of the Baltic states.
[00:40:21.246 --> 00:40:22.326]  Czechoslovakia!
[00:40:22.826 --> 00:40:24.266]  That's right, all of these countries.
[00:40:24.486 --> 00:40:28.187]  And the thing is, we cannot let this go there, people.
[00:40:28.287 --> 00:40:30.968]  Some people are saying, well, we'll just let it roll over us and then we're going to resist.
[00:40:31.028 --> 00:40:31.208]  No!
[00:40:31.548 --> 00:40:32.408]  You stop this now!
[00:40:33.789 --> 00:40:34.930]  By God, you're Americans.
[00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:36.451]  You stop this now.
[00:40:36.552 --> 00:40:37.412]  Listen to my words.
[00:40:37.512 --> 00:40:38.413]  Stop this now.
[00:40:39.314 --> 00:40:41.336]  For you people in the military, I'm going to say this again.
[00:40:41.356 --> 00:40:42.377]  Alex is not saying this.
[00:40:42.437 --> 00:40:43.478]  Mark Corky is saying this.
[00:40:44.159 --> 00:40:46.921]  When the time comes and somebody gives you an order to flatten a U.S.
[00:40:46.961 --> 00:40:54.428]  city to make an excuse for Tel Aviv and for England and a couple of other countries to come in here and rape this country the rest of the way by manipulating the spiders,
[00:40:54.952 --> 00:41:04.855]  You turn, pull your weapon out, you put the weapon to their ear immediately and pull the trigger three times, because they're going to take three shots to hit that little pea brain of that rat that's going to give that order.
[00:41:05.936 --> 00:41:12.838]  If you don't, what you're going to see is a destruction in the United States, and some people are saying, well, we have to do sacrifices because we've got to save the nation.
[00:41:12.858 --> 00:41:14.219]  You're not going to save the nation with this.
[00:41:14.679 --> 00:41:16.179]  They plan on gutting the country.
[00:41:16.499 --> 00:41:18.440]  They're going to split it three ways going on four.
[00:41:19.144 --> 00:41:25.588]  They're gonna gut the country just like they did when they were attacking Germany back in the 20s and 30s when they raped them for all the resources they could.
[00:41:25.928 --> 00:41:31.732]  By the way, look at the map of Germany's economic corridor that was made by France, and take a look.
[00:41:31.792 --> 00:41:39.677]  Lay that map from France through Germany, lay that map over Mexico and the United States, and tell me that it isn't a repeat of history.
[00:41:40.118 --> 00:41:48.023]  The industrial corridor that's gonna come through your state in Texas, guys, is designed to flush the wealth, the raw materials, out of the United States,
[00:41:48.684 --> 00:41:52.707]  And gut us for every penny they can take physically as repossession.
[00:41:52.727 --> 00:41:53.647]  That's right.
[00:41:53.707 --> 00:41:56.609]  It's basically spider fangs to suck the juices out.
[00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.890]  Exactly.
[00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:59.131]  And here's the thing, too, guys.
[00:41:59.891 --> 00:42:04.074]  For instance, right down there, again, most Americans are hearing about this, but let's remind everybody.
[00:42:04.554 --> 00:42:08.516]  What business do the Spanish have running Texas roads and running them as a toll road?
[00:42:08.536 --> 00:42:12.439]  Why are they sending the money to Spain, and then Texas is going to get
[00:42:13.139 --> 00:42:14.159]  But if you look, U.S.
[00:42:14.199 --> 00:42:15.460]  companies don't even exist.
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:19.401]  Anheuser-Busch, all the car companies, it's all being bought up.
[00:42:19.761 --> 00:42:23.602]  All the roads, all the ports, city governments that privatize are being bought.
[00:42:23.622 --> 00:42:31.104]  You've got private Merc forces, like LCRA Water has their own SWAT teams and squads and surveils us all.
[00:42:31.684 --> 00:42:34.805]  I mean, it's just hellish mafia takeover at every level.
[00:42:35.445 --> 00:42:36.425]  But it can be prevented.
[00:42:36.465 --> 00:42:40.226]  By the way, with our Ford, Chrysler and GM employees listening, and retirees,
[00:42:40.726 --> 00:42:47.470]  The stocks are so low, you all need to buy the company so you're on the stock floor when the time comes to tell them what to do, people.
[00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:49.311]  Don't let the Europeans or the Asians buy it.
[00:42:49.731 --> 00:42:50.232]  You buy it up.
[00:42:50.252 --> 00:42:51.292]  You ain't got nothing to lose.
[00:42:51.312 --> 00:42:52.653]  Your retirement's at stake.
[00:42:52.673 --> 00:42:53.153]  Do it now.
[00:42:53.413 --> 00:42:54.094]  Here we go.
[00:42:54.634 --> 00:42:55.174]  Stay with us.
[00:42:57.996 --> 00:42:59.357]  I want to talk to Mark behind the scenes again.
[00:43:00.978 --> 00:43:03.719]  Mark, we got to get into this Ron Paul stuff when we get back.
[00:43:07.605 --> 00:43:08.525]  We need to explain.
[00:43:09.025 --> 00:43:12.966]  I mean, I can't believe that they've... It's so incredible.
[00:43:13.086 --> 00:43:16.647]  Foreigners, criminals, felons, youth brigades.
[00:43:19.108 --> 00:43:23.609]  It's just... It's so incredible that it even amazes me.
[00:43:23.669 --> 00:43:26.690]  So I know that's why some of the public just can't believe it.
[00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:28.731]  I mean, it's so incredible.
[00:43:29.271 --> 00:43:31.591]  Here's a fun one for everybody to be reminded of, Alex.
[00:43:31.831 --> 00:43:34.112]  Wild in the streets with Malcolm McDowell.
[00:43:36.681 --> 00:43:39.302]  Wild in the Streets with Malcolm McDowell.
[00:43:39.982 --> 00:43:40.582]  Fill me in.
[00:43:40.922 --> 00:43:42.162]  It's a 70's movie.
[00:43:42.683 --> 00:43:46.944]  Malcolm McDowell is younger than the president's normal age.
[00:43:47.764 --> 00:43:58.847]  They push the youth of America, the youth brigades, mobilize and they demand that the restrictions on age for office be dropped and Malcolm McDowell becomes the youngest president of the United States.
[00:43:59.327 --> 00:44:04.088]  They round up all the older people, over 30, put them in detention camps, put them on LSD,
[00:44:05.603 --> 00:44:18.771]  And in the end of the movie, by the time they're done, he thinks he's got everything under control, and all of a sudden he gets a call from some of his henchmen in the White House, in the Oval Office, that the pre-teens are now revolting against the teenagers and the 20-year-olds.
[00:44:20.732 --> 00:44:21.572]  Sounds like a good movie.
[00:44:21.612 --> 00:44:22.373]  I've heard of that one.
[00:44:22.453 --> 00:44:24.014]  Yeah, Wild in the Streets, Malcolm McDowell.
[00:44:24.034 --> 00:44:25.555]  Wild in the Streets, Malcolm McDowell.
[00:44:26.075 --> 00:44:29.197]  And by the way, Shelley Winters was in it, too.
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:32.322]  She played, I think, his mother.
[00:44:32.703 --> 00:44:38.870]  Well, Mark, what they've got going for them is the full horror of what they're setting up.
[00:44:40.512 --> 00:44:49.424]  The average person consciously knows it's true, has seen enough evidence, but then they make the double-think decision because it's so scary to just deny it.
[00:44:49.884 --> 00:44:55.847]  And we need to talk about that mechanism and then get into Ron Paul when we get back to the main broadcast here in just a moment.
[00:44:55.867 --> 00:44:58.789]  And later in the next hour, I've got a few fine sponsors I need to plug.
[00:44:58.809 --> 00:45:02.311]  I'm going to plug one right now when we come out, and then we'll get right back to you, Mark.
[00:45:02.371 --> 00:45:11.376]  And don't leave before you plug the book and the manuals and the rest of the work that you and your folks are doing.
[00:45:11.416 --> 00:45:11.956]  Here we go, Mark.
[00:45:23.743 --> 00:45:26.706]  Go to survivalistseeds.com now.
[00:45:26.726 --> 00:45:32.191]  12,000 seeds giving you 5,000 pounds of food for just four pennies a pound.
[00:45:32.231 --> 00:45:34.033]  Without a long-term food solution.
[00:45:36.397 --> 00:45:41.222]  Visit SurvivalistSeeds.com and check out our Doomsday Water Filter System.
[00:45:41.343 --> 00:45:43.044]  Without water, you die.
[00:45:43.105 --> 00:45:46.488]  It's all online at SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[00:45:46.708 --> 00:45:47.730]  Are you prepared?

[00:45:52.615 --> 00:45:54.137]  Do it now or become...
[00:46:01.733 --> 00:46:30.574]  In the mornin' you go runnin' For the man who stole your water And you'll fight till he is done But they catch you at the border And the mourners are all slangin' As they drag you by your feet
[00:46:45.815 --> 00:46:50.037]  The New World Order are just a society of parasites and crooks.
[00:46:50.697 --> 00:46:53.058]  They love to suck off better men and women.
[00:46:53.898 --> 00:46:55.198]  They don't like your morals.
[00:46:55.218 --> 00:46:56.659]  They don't like the fact that you're happy.
[00:46:57.099 --> 00:47:00.260]  They only enjoy hurting people and flaunting their power.
[00:47:01.786 --> 00:47:04.048]  And they have diseased many of us with their own taste.
[00:47:04.448 --> 00:47:05.329]  We have to reject that.
[00:47:05.349 --> 00:47:07.531]  We have to come back together as communities.
[00:47:07.771 --> 00:47:14.297]  I want to talk with Mark about what it'll look like if they were to win, what happened in the Soviet Union, what happened in China, what happened in Germany.
[00:47:14.397 --> 00:47:22.704]  I had a top former White House analyst and Treasury Department analyst, a well-known historian, Richard C. Cook, on and he said no.
[00:47:23.485 --> 00:47:26.866]  He's sure they plan a mass extermination in this country, a huge purge.
[00:47:27.427 --> 00:47:31.968]  Tens of millions, conservatively, to take property and murder and then kill their enforcers.
[00:47:31.988 --> 00:47:33.469]  They'll always do that in several waves.
[00:47:33.489 --> 00:47:35.990]  We're going to go back to Mark in a moment and get into Ron Paul.
[00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:37.430]  Some big events are about to occur.
[00:47:37.810 --> 00:47:44.573]  Congressman warns that chaos is about to be unleashed on economic and political system by globalist intervention and world empire.
[00:47:44.933 --> 00:47:48.214]  Talk about that in the next hour and take your calls for Mark Kornke at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:47:53.303 --> 00:48:20.888]  I do want to also let you know that this show is made possible by the sales of the books and videos, not just the books and films that I've written or made at InfoWars.com, but the other books and videos we carry, like Washington You're Fired, or The Money Masters on the Banking System, or my new film, of course, Truth Rising, very, very important, or Endgame, or Terror Storm, the final cut that's got it all, how they blew up Building 7, just everything.
[00:48:22.113 --> 00:48:26.075]  And remember, just because you know about this doesn't mean your neighbors and friends and family do.
[00:48:26.195 --> 00:48:28.196]  Or maybe you talked to them a year ago and they laughed at you.
[00:48:28.316 --> 00:48:29.396]  Now they're not going to laugh.
[00:48:29.456 --> 00:48:31.017]  Or there's a better chance they won't laugh.
[00:48:31.437 --> 00:48:37.180]  Or down the road, like a seed that sprouts from a year before, they will remember what we said, what we did.
[00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:39.241]  Because as Mark said, we told you so.
[00:48:39.321 --> 00:48:40.942]  We broke down what was happening.
[00:48:41.684 --> 00:48:49.307]  We have another great sponsor, and that's Ecolo Blue, and their website is E-C-H-O-L-O-Blue.
[00:48:49.327 --> 00:48:51.488]  E-C-O-L-O-Blue.
[00:48:51.508 --> 00:48:52.288]  Ecolo.
[00:48:52.488 --> 00:48:54.689]  E-C-O-L-O-Blue.com.
[00:48:54.709 --> 00:49:00.072]  There's a big banner up on Infowars.com to EcoloBlue.com.
[00:49:00.452 --> 00:49:02.873]  It is an atmospheric water generator for your home.
[00:49:03.473 --> 00:49:05.294]  In the desert, it gets gallons a day.
[00:49:05.994 --> 00:49:07.455]  I can't imagine how much water it would give you.
[00:49:07.475 --> 00:49:11.937]  I mean, here in Austin, the thing just fills up in a few hours, and we never seem to drain it each day.
[00:49:11.957 --> 00:49:14.299]  But it just makes gallon after gallon out of the air.
[00:49:14.319 --> 00:49:15.479]  It has five filters in it.
[00:49:15.499 --> 00:49:18.901]  It's got a little maintenance manual, easy to clean and take care of.
[00:49:18.961 --> 00:49:19.561]  Great folks.
[00:49:19.981 --> 00:49:23.123]  Call Oblue.com or give them a call to get a free catalog.

[00:49:29.106 --> 00:49:33.468]  And if you plug this into a solar panel system, it doesn't take a lot of power, then you've got water anywhere.
[00:49:33.488 --> 00:49:34.189]  Don't need a well.
[00:49:34.209 --> 00:49:35.870]  And this gets water in the desert, folks.
[00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:38.191]  There's so much water in the air.
[00:49:38.211 --> 00:49:39.612]  866-585-4044.

[00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:53.262]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:50:53.443 --> 00:50:55.304]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:50:55.884 --> 00:50:58.626]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:50:58.926 --> 00:51:04.409]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.

[00:52:29.433 --> 00:52:32.334]  Coming up over the next break, your phone calls for Mark Kornke.
[00:52:33.114 --> 00:52:35.295]  Ron Paul, some big events are about to occur.
[00:52:36.075 --> 00:52:37.596]  This is all up on Infowars.net.
[00:52:39.017 --> 00:52:46.761]  Congressman warns of chaos about to be unleashed on economic and political system by globalist intervention and world empire.
[00:52:47.141 --> 00:52:58.447]  Texas Congressman Ron Paul has warned the House that he is convinced the time is now upon us that some big events are about to occur that will cause liberty to go into deep hibernation.
[00:52:59.147 --> 00:53:02.589]  Paul told the House, these fast-approaching events will not go unnoticed.
[00:53:02.609 --> 00:53:03.709]  They will affect us all.
[00:53:04.009 --> 00:53:06.450]  They will not be limited to just some areas of our country.
[00:53:06.751 --> 00:53:11.053]  The world economy and political system will share in the chaos that's about to be unleashed.
[00:53:11.113 --> 00:53:15.615]  There are reasons, I'm quoting Ron Paul, there are reasons, Dr. Congressman Ron Paul,
[00:53:16.235 --> 00:53:21.797]  There are reasons to believe this coming crisis is different and bigger than the world has ever experienced.
[00:53:22.038 --> 00:53:31.502]  Instead of using globalism in a positive fashion, it's been used to globalize all the mistakes of the politicians, bureaucrats, and central bankers, continued Paul.
[00:53:32.242 --> 00:53:38.787]  And he goes, our arrogance and aggressiveness have been used to promote a world empire backed by the most powerful of history.
[00:53:39.107 --> 00:53:46.412]  This type of globalist intervention creates problems for all citizens of the world and fails to contribute to the well-being of the world's populations.
[00:53:46.712 --> 00:53:50.015]  Just think how our personal liberties have been tarnished here at home.
[00:53:50.675 --> 00:53:53.296]  Have been trashed here at home in the last decade.
[00:53:53.697 --> 00:53:56.138]  Paul went on to say that very serious times are ahead.
[00:53:56.178 --> 00:54:01.441]  The entire speech and video and audio of it is up on Infowars.net right now.
[00:54:01.521 --> 00:54:02.261]  Very important article.
[00:54:03.422 --> 00:54:07.704]  And when we talk about the center of the empire being in England, we're not bashing British people.
[00:54:07.724 --> 00:54:09.825]  We're talking about the elite city of London within London.
[00:54:09.845 --> 00:54:13.567]  When we bash Israel, we're talking about the elite that dominates and controls there.
[00:54:14.670 --> 00:54:15.591]  We talk about America.
[00:54:15.611 --> 00:54:17.312]  We talk about the Communist Chinese.
[00:54:17.352 --> 00:54:18.593]  We're not blaming the people.
[00:54:18.613 --> 00:54:21.494]  In fact, they're fighting back with more spirit than here in the U.S.
[00:54:21.555 --> 00:54:22.195]  against tyranny.
[00:54:22.915 --> 00:54:26.338]  Unarmed against guys with tanks and guns and taking over cities every week.
[00:54:27.298 --> 00:54:28.619]  It's really shut down in the media.
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:30.160]  And this is the fact.
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:32.482]  The human spirit cries out for liberty.
[00:54:32.742 --> 00:54:35.284]  The globalists know that, so they brought in this control grid.
[00:54:35.984 --> 00:54:42.748]  And if we just realize we can win, and if we wake enough people up before they drop the hammer, there's no way we can lose.
[00:54:42.808 --> 00:54:43.309]  Is there, Mark?
[00:54:44.028 --> 00:54:51.553]  No, in fact, the bottom line is they're terrified of the idea, remember, that the Borg, even though they get their butts stomped, always would repeat, it's futile to resist, you will be absorbed.
[00:54:52.433 --> 00:54:58.938]  Uh, Sun Tzul, uh, the basic rule of warfare, convince your enemy before the first arrow leaves the bow that he has lost.
[00:54:59.598 --> 00:55:02.000]  In other words, propaganda and illusion.
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:11.686]  The pickpocket, the thief, whoever, depend upon, in fact, even the magician, depend upon illusion and confusion so that they can accomplish their goal.
[00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:15.421]  Now, the same is true with regard to these ring knockers.
[00:55:15.621 --> 00:55:18.081]  Take a look at the scabbiest crows and what they really are.
[00:55:18.181 --> 00:55:21.062]  Now remember, they've been around for a long time.
[00:55:21.342 --> 00:55:23.582]  And again, our argument has been, well, just do it!
[00:55:23.602 --> 00:55:28.924]  You know, this is something that in the 90s people said, oh, they did this to us, or oh, they did that.
[00:55:28.984 --> 00:55:32.484]  People, for all of their abuse, they understood and they still understand the numbers.
[00:55:32.524 --> 00:55:34.405]  But the problem is, they're getting old.
[00:55:35.205 --> 00:55:40.246]  Now they're grabbing for the ring because they're scared that they're not going to be the ones remembered.
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:42.801]  People don't remember number two.
[00:55:43.441 --> 00:55:52.126]  In the ring knocker societies with all these clandestine groups, nobody's going to remember the guy who set the guy up that won, or that supposedly might get the ring.
[00:55:52.806 --> 00:55:54.767]  Instead, he's left in the dustbin.
[00:55:54.847 --> 00:55:56.628]  He's left in the history, you know, second foot now.
[00:55:56.648 --> 00:55:58.990]  Well, there's also a suicidal nihilism about it.
[00:55:59.010 --> 00:56:10.496]  They even write in some of their writings that if they can't have complete power, they'll destroy it all, including releasing something to kill everything on the face of the earth, just to be mean and greedy and hateful.
[00:56:10.922 --> 00:56:14.285]  Well, that's part of the throw that they've always used in the past and always will.
[00:56:14.545 --> 00:56:17.467]  I don't think it'll be any different, be it conventional ordinance or whatever the idea is.
[00:56:17.507 --> 00:56:19.048]  If I can't have you, what will you know what?
[00:56:19.128 --> 00:56:19.729]  And you first.
[00:56:20.289 --> 00:56:21.470]  This is the attitude we've got to have.
[00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:22.150]  Them first.
[00:56:22.771 --> 00:56:24.252]  Everybody needs to be thinking that way.
[00:56:24.312 --> 00:56:30.536]  It's like these people with the cases you had down there at the one university where they're all cheering, you know, killing 80% of the population.
[00:56:30.717 --> 00:56:31.117]  You know what?
[00:56:31.696 --> 00:56:34.318]  Everyone in that room, we should have shut the doors and sent them first.
[00:56:34.418 --> 00:56:34.698]  Why?
[00:56:35.019 --> 00:56:36.240]  They can be leading examples.
[00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:36.920]  Exactly.
[00:56:37.861 --> 00:56:38.882]  They want it 90% dead.
[00:56:38.922 --> 00:56:39.462]  It's even worse.
[00:56:39.722 --> 00:56:43.305]  Yeah, they should have all just passed out revolvers, passed out razor blades.
[00:56:43.345 --> 00:56:43.906]  Let's see it!
[00:56:44.206 --> 00:56:45.587]  Come on, blow your heads off!
[00:56:45.907 --> 00:56:47.689]  You first, you scumbag trash!
[00:56:47.749 --> 00:56:49.190]  We're going to be talking behind the scenes.
[00:56:49.610 --> 00:56:51.112]  Then your phone calls on the other side.
[00:56:51.132 --> 00:56:53.013]  In fact, just IMM the calls, John.
[00:56:53.053 --> 00:56:53.353]  Thank you.
[00:56:54.074 --> 00:56:55.115]  Alright, here we go.
[00:56:58.703 --> 00:57:02.007]  You know, Mark, that's a great point, but they'd use double-think on us.
[00:57:02.027 --> 00:57:12.197]  They'd say, how dare you say we should kill ourselves, but then they just said kill 90% of us, but then with double-think, oh, don't say that we should, no, no, we're not saying we're going to kill you, we're saying kill yourselves.
[00:57:12.237 --> 00:57:12.598]  Go ahead.
[00:57:12.618 --> 00:57:13.278]  Right, well, you do it.
[00:57:13.318 --> 00:57:16.301]  You jump over the cliff first and we'll watch to see if it's a viable solution.
[00:57:16.462 --> 00:57:17.483]  Oh, that doesn't look pretty.
[00:57:17.583 --> 00:57:19.485]  You know, Alex, I think we'll just stand here and watch him.
[00:57:19.585 --> 00:57:20.366]  Oh, there goes another one.
[00:57:20.546 --> 00:57:21.507]  Oh, that's really messy.
[00:57:22.105 --> 00:57:24.286]  No, I think we'll just stay over here away from those lemmings.
[00:57:24.466 --> 00:57:25.827]  But, I mean, look at the double think.
[00:57:26.147 --> 00:57:27.328]  They're going to say, oh, that's terrible.
[00:57:27.368 --> 00:57:31.990]  They said that, no, no, we have to oversee the killing for the greater cause.
[00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:33.131]  And then that's what Bianca said.
[00:57:33.171 --> 00:57:35.772]  He said, I'm ready for me and my family to die.
[00:57:35.812 --> 00:57:38.214]  And he started going, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.
[00:57:38.254 --> 00:57:40.015]  These are just, oh, but you know what?
[00:57:40.055 --> 00:57:43.697]  That guy would really squeal for his life if he was actually about to die.
[00:57:43.757 --> 00:57:44.417]  I guarantee it.
[00:57:44.817 --> 00:57:51.101]  Well, either that or here's the problem is, like you said, you have a nihilist on your hand who is, again, it is a sick mind to begin with.
[00:57:52.157 --> 00:57:53.819]  Well, have you seen the videos of him?
[00:57:53.839 --> 00:57:55.581]  I mean, he literally can hardly talk.
[00:57:56.122 --> 00:57:56.802]  He's in Endgame.
[00:57:56.822 --> 00:58:04.450]  He's just like... And then you see him on the UT official website in a druid outfit saying he loves Lucifer.
[00:58:05.051 --> 00:58:05.231]  Right.
[00:58:05.331 --> 00:58:06.593]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:58:06.753 --> 00:58:08.635]  These characters have sold their soul.
[00:58:08.655 --> 00:58:10.517]  Their actual nature is coming out.
[00:58:10.577 --> 00:58:11.277]  That's the problem.
[00:58:11.297 --> 00:58:12.619]  Remember, we've argued this for years.
[00:58:13.379 --> 00:58:14.620]  This is a light-dark issue.
[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:17.222]  This is a darkness, you know, evil versus good.
[00:58:17.482 --> 00:58:18.102]  It's that simple.
[00:58:18.282 --> 00:58:21.144]  But they are like a lobotomized golem.
[00:58:21.364 --> 00:58:29.049]  I mean, they literally, when you really meet globalists, as you know, Mark, they're literally like... Take the Prince of Darkness, Richard Perle.
[00:58:29.389 --> 00:58:34.173]  They describe him as ghoulish and literally rubbing his... He'll walk up to beautiful women at...
[00:58:34.975 --> 00:58:47.262]  At cocktail parties, and he doesn't know how to pick them up, he literally starts bragging, I have killed millions, this has been in the news, I have power, I bomb people, and even other globalists go, ooh.
[00:58:47.882 --> 00:58:51.545]  I mean, imagine walking up and going, oh, ooh, yes.
[00:58:51.565 --> 00:58:52.545]  Go ahead, Mark.
[00:58:52.805 --> 00:58:53.286]  Exactly.
[00:58:53.766 --> 00:58:55.187]  That is the problem that we have.
[00:58:55.347 --> 00:58:59.089]  And what needs to be done, and here's the thing, and this is what they're terrified of,
[00:58:59.727 --> 00:59:02.989]  Their logic is that we don't like the technology so we don't know how to use it.
[00:59:03.089 --> 00:59:11.233]  The problem that they have now is all of what they have created is now going to allow us to show people exactly what they are like.
[00:59:12.254 --> 00:59:17.857]  And that is, I think, the greatest fear that they have because the logic is that they've always been able to keep it one-sided.
[00:59:18.597 --> 00:59:25.841]  We need to use every tool to record and to document because when the time comes, the concept of justice tempered with mercy
[00:59:26.471 --> 00:59:32.635]  Means that we are going to bring them all forward, and we are going to show the world exactly what they are.
[00:59:33.756 --> 00:59:44.703]  That is the first and best service we can commit to eliminating them as a threat for many generations, because they've always used this, oh, they're just a benevolent, kind old guy, really?
[00:59:44.763 --> 00:59:47.285]  Like that nutcase in Texas that wants to kill 80-90% of the population?
[00:59:49.116 --> 00:59:50.517]  Let's look at him the way he really is.
[00:59:50.537 --> 01:00:03.823]  But you go to his website and he's talking about Lucifer in a druid outfit on the UT website, and he's connected to the bioweapons labs at UT with 95% of thousands of the professors going, oh!
[01:00:04.103 --> 01:00:08.526]  I mean, it was standing ovations with huge red skulls projected on the wall.
[01:00:08.926 --> 01:00:10.487]  I mean, these people are dangerous.
[01:00:10.507 --> 01:00:11.107]  Here we go, Mark.
[01:00:19.013 --> 01:00:24.637]  Mark, you know, it's got to shake up the Bilderberg group that we're committed and don't care if they arrest us or detain us.
[01:00:24.657 --> 01:00:34.363]  I mean, when they would drive in, the Queen of the Netherlands and David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski and Henry Kissinger and the King of Spain showed up.
[01:00:35.724 --> 01:00:37.906]  When they would show up and drive past, we would see them.
[01:00:38.546 --> 01:00:41.168]  Madeleine Albright panicked and then sped back out and left.
[01:00:41.188 --> 01:00:47.672]  Because when she got out, we were bullhorning her with huge industrial bullhorns going, Madeleine, Madeleine, you murdered the Iraqi children.
[01:00:47.712 --> 01:00:48.693]  She got scared and left.
[01:00:49.734 --> 01:00:57.101]  When Bernanke drove by, he was on an untinted window, and he looked really upset and looked at us like we were 500 foot goblins or something.
[01:00:57.481 --> 01:01:02.265]  And that's the thing, is they hate it that we're committed and ready to be killed and ready to be tortured to die.
[01:01:02.285 --> 01:01:03.807]  That doesn't mean we're going to go along with it.
[01:01:04.227 --> 01:01:05.748]  But I mean, they know we're committed.
[01:01:05.768 --> 01:01:09.952]  I think they're realizing that they're going to... I know they're going to lose.
[01:01:10.072 --> 01:01:12.615]  I can tell in my heart of hearts they are going to go down, Mark.
[01:01:13.923 --> 01:01:15.624]  ...that they have and now it's realized.
[01:01:15.644 --> 01:01:17.826]  You see, their argument is there's no place to hide.
[01:01:17.886 --> 01:01:21.748]  Well, you know, kind of like what Chesty Pollard said years ago when they were at the Chosin Reservoir.
[01:01:21.768 --> 01:01:23.109]  I mentioned this last time around the air.
[01:01:23.649 --> 01:01:26.551]  The Major walked up and said, Sir, we're surrounded.
[01:01:26.851 --> 01:01:27.952]  And he looked at me and he said, Good!
[01:01:27.972 --> 01:01:30.113]  That means we can attack in all directions.
[01:01:30.894 --> 01:01:32.675]  Every bullet counts from that point forward.
[01:01:32.715 --> 01:01:33.335]  Well, you know what?
[01:01:34.076 --> 01:01:42.721]  There's one part about this is that when the time comes, the global connections that they've created means that there is also no place
[01:01:43.246 --> 01:01:44.807]  For them to run.
[01:01:46.308 --> 01:01:47.069]  Think about this.
[01:01:47.169 --> 01:01:50.091]  Before they've- and in fact, they're already trying to figure this out.
[01:01:50.451 --> 01:01:51.672]  You know, I'll give you an example.
[01:01:52.092 --> 01:01:56.235]  I've always asked people, what about these massive yachts that you see in different magazines?
[01:01:56.275 --> 01:01:56.895]  Who buys them?
[01:01:57.396 --> 01:01:58.016]  Where are they?
[01:01:58.296 --> 01:01:59.777]  Why is it you don't see images of them?
[01:01:59.897 --> 01:02:01.018]  If you do, it's very rare.
[01:02:01.038 --> 01:02:04.661]  And when you do, they look like cruise liners parked in whatever harbor they're in.
[01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:08.323]  Well, it's because that's one of the many refuges they think they're going to use.
[01:02:08.743 --> 01:02:09.504]  But here's the thing.
[01:02:10.037 --> 01:02:18.423]  When we are done, and there's going to be a two-phase war, one of the points, the secret police are the shock troops, and most of them are the goofs that are designed to be expendable.
[01:02:19.363 --> 01:02:21.204]  Once that happens, then we will defeat them.
[01:02:21.224 --> 01:02:25.067]  They're designed to consume resources in what is a one-two-three punch.
[01:02:25.811 --> 01:02:33.158]  Second phase is going to be conventional ground forces, mostly foreign, although some... And we see this in Iraq right now, but go ahead.
[01:02:33.498 --> 01:02:33.699]  Right.
[01:02:33.739 --> 01:02:38.743]  Now the next step is, as they get more frustrated, they're going to pour more assets into the U.S.
[01:02:38.783 --> 01:02:40.205]  to attack the American people.
[01:02:40.265 --> 01:02:40.925]  But that's simple.
[01:02:41.686 --> 01:02:42.487]  The problem is this.
[01:02:42.567 --> 01:02:45.029]  We have militaries that are not going to go along with it.
[01:02:45.049 --> 01:02:45.770]  They're overseas.
[01:02:45.930 --> 01:02:50.895]  The sad part is, they're in frontier posture, far away from the homeland, from the United States.
[01:02:51.365 --> 01:03:01.287]  The enemy won't bring them back if they can help it because they realize that their wives, their children, their families, their grandpas, their grandmas are the ones that they're being told to fight and kill.
[01:03:01.927 --> 01:03:06.488]  So the biggest problem is for our soldiers listening overseas is that they're in a very bad situation.
[01:03:07.208 --> 01:03:09.568]  I would be best if they could get back here in time.
[01:03:09.688 --> 01:03:18.370]  Personally, they should be probably looking at stepping away from the uniform at this time unless they're in key positions that we established years ago inside the military.
[01:03:18.959 --> 01:03:23.022]  We have a large number of people who are biding their time.
[01:03:23.562 --> 01:03:29.086]  How do you think we were able to map out what transpired over the last 15 years?
[01:03:29.927 --> 01:03:33.249]  I worked as a 94B Intelligence Analyst, a 94B20.
[01:03:33.529 --> 01:03:36.531]  I am USAID educated.
[01:03:36.591 --> 01:03:37.612]  I was educated at U.S.
[01:03:37.672 --> 01:03:39.373]  Army Intelligence Center and Schools.
[01:03:39.533 --> 01:03:41.134]  I was not assigned my post.
[01:03:41.675 --> 01:03:43.296]  I was trained to my post.
[01:03:43.897 --> 01:03:58.460]  I also worked as a 96C and I worked as a security manager, military trained, not something I just stepped into, with regard to OPSEC and other elements of communications and tangible securities.
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:07.821]  So this is one thing that when I talk, we've done this from both behind the wire or behind the scenes, so to speak, and also right out in your face.
[01:04:07.921 --> 01:04:12.422]  The reason I started this years ago was because we were doing this from behind the scenes for a decade, people.
[01:04:13.095 --> 01:04:14.116]  And what we saw is this.
[01:04:14.156 --> 01:04:16.698]  We could have stomped them and stopped them much, much sooner.
[01:04:16.999 --> 01:04:19.141]  But nobody wanted to step up and say no.
[01:04:19.221 --> 01:04:30.591]  And no one wanted to admit on the outside, you know, there's all these guys from government and intelligence saying there's a plan to create youth brigades and gun control and overrun the borders and the North American Union.
[01:04:31.072 --> 01:04:32.273]  Oh, they're all crazy!
[01:04:32.313 --> 01:04:38.238]  And then people got together all the declassified documents and made big books and videos and, oh, that's still crazy.
[01:04:38.258 --> 01:04:38.719]  And then now,
[01:04:39.139 --> 01:04:43.500]  You read some book from 20 years ago, or a video from 15 years ago, it's all happened!
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:47.561]  And now we look at the final chapters of the books and we're going, my God, is the next thing going to happen?
[01:04:48.022 --> 01:04:58.845]  And yes, they're going to stage more terror, bring in more police, brainwash the cops, incrementally turn the heat up, hire more felons and crooks, and then they do plan to start just murdering tens of millions of us.
[01:04:59.485 --> 01:05:06.427]  Now, most important here again, real quick guys, I'm going to touch on this, get a gas mask now, get a gas mask now, and get a gas mask now.
[01:05:07.031 --> 01:05:07.912]  Get extra filters.
[01:05:08.052 --> 01:05:12.456]  If it's cheaper to buy another gas mask than to get extra filters, more masks are better.
[01:05:13.036 --> 01:05:14.657]  We need everything we're talking about.
[01:05:14.698 --> 01:05:17.420]  Your sponsors, Alex, for instance, have water purification.
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:18.561]  Water is life.
[01:05:20.002 --> 01:05:21.103]  You have to have water.
[01:05:21.243 --> 01:05:22.124]  We must have food.
[01:05:22.164 --> 01:05:24.005]  He who controls the water controls the food.
[01:05:24.025 --> 01:05:26.908]  He who controls the food controls the people.
[01:05:27.543 --> 01:05:29.423]  But both of those elements are instrumental.
[01:05:47.688 --> 01:05:51.869]  But only a few million that really know what's going on and are really ready for this.
[01:05:52.589 --> 01:05:57.650]  And then looking at the enemy's posture and things they're planning, Chicago does seem to be one of their main areas.
[01:05:58.371 --> 01:06:00.871]  But you never know, they might say, look over here and then do something over there.
[01:06:01.231 --> 01:06:03.532]  How do you see this unfolding and what do you see coming up?
[01:06:03.972 --> 01:06:05.732]  Well, real quick, let's do a compression here.
[01:06:05.752 --> 01:06:07.273]  First of all, strategic overview.
[01:06:07.413 --> 01:06:11.254]  Many parts of the world, people fully understand what it is they see as a risk or a threat.
[01:06:11.814 --> 01:06:15.855]  America, exactly as was described in George Washington's three visions,
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:16.560]  He's
[01:06:32.748 --> 01:06:37.130]  Through your state in Texas and up through the western side of the Mississippi River.
[01:06:37.170 --> 01:06:44.815]  And they brought up all the papers, all the newspapers of foreign companies have, Spanish and German and Dutch and British, have brought up all the papers there.
[01:06:45.075 --> 01:06:50.098]  They're also moving in former FBI and others would be the sheriffs in all those areas.
[01:06:50.118 --> 01:06:55.240]  So they're moving massive amounts of propaganda, control grid, surveillance into those corridors.
[01:06:55.781 --> 01:06:59.763]  Most of the FBI are traitors who are working for a foreign power.
[01:07:00.290 --> 01:07:03.492]  Who are with one clandestine element or another.
[01:07:03.952 --> 01:07:07.073]  They must be looked at as hostile, coming into your community.
[01:07:07.473 --> 01:07:13.076]  Their agenda, if they are trying to get into a public post, is to betray the local people.
[01:07:13.816 --> 01:07:14.877]  Understand that, period.
[01:07:14.897 --> 01:07:17.498]  If you think anything else, you are making a foolish mistake.
[01:07:18.018 --> 01:07:21.700]  These people have an allegiance to foreign powers, not to America.
[01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:29.664]  Their mission is to surrender the United States, in its cut-up form, to the ring-knockers outside of this country.
[01:07:30.086 --> 01:07:30.827]  Now, here's the thing.
[01:07:30.947 --> 01:07:32.088]  Look at the stroke people.
[01:07:32.208 --> 01:07:36.571]  Straight up through the western side of the United States, the Mississippi River is a natural land barrier.
[01:07:37.032 --> 01:07:47.400]  Number two is an eight-lane highway becomes an excellent patrol control zone, dividing the critical elements that are still valuable to the globalists.
[01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:54.806]  The western provinces of the United States, which have uranium, gold, iron, copper,
[01:07:55.430 --> 01:08:05.643]  The whole of the Rockies could not be touched because of, not all of it, but a good portion of it could not be touched because of America's national parks system established a hundred years ago.
[01:08:06.344 --> 01:08:09.448]  But, by surrendering them as collateral to the IMF,
[01:08:09.966 --> 01:08:18.149]  We now have the vast treasuries of physical wealth of the United States in the claws... And by the way, we have the executive orders in UNESCO.
[01:08:18.529 --> 01:08:30.633]  They then have spokes in buffer zones which total half the land mass under international agreements, now under internationalist control, brainwashing the youth brigades about fake carbon taxes and total control.
[01:08:30.733 --> 01:08:31.893]  I mean, it is bad.
[01:08:32.441 --> 01:08:34.942]  Now, second tier here, three divisions.
[01:08:35.022 --> 01:08:44.466]  The Appalachians and the Southern, from the Appalachians South, the Southern states are carved off separately, with Florida kept as an independent international zone for the partiers.
[01:08:45.307 --> 01:08:53.230]  The Southwestern part of the United States, with the boobies coming up from Mexico, will be carved off with a military force of, what, about 10 million already in place?
[01:08:53.837 --> 01:09:01.761]  Occupiers from a foreign country or foreign countries who have all over the Spanish radio, get the gringos, take over, break up Aslan.
[01:09:01.781 --> 01:09:03.562]  We're going to get them all funded.
[01:09:05.263 --> 01:09:09.805]  Anglo-owned TV stations, 700 plus billboards saying LA belongs to Mexico.
[01:09:10.205 --> 01:09:11.306]  It is military.
[01:09:11.346 --> 01:09:11.726]  Go ahead.
[01:09:12.086 --> 01:09:14.968]  Now the next step is the northwestern part of the United States.
[01:09:15.612 --> 01:09:19.953]  Russian and Chinese influence, along with the rest of the Asian Rim.
[01:09:20.193 --> 01:09:33.058]  And by the way, you always said that, and now we have the international agreements, and they've openly said we will use foreign troops to quote, fight American terrorists from NATO, and then now every time there's a fire, they bring in foreign troops to fight the fires.
[01:09:33.538 --> 01:09:34.978]  All this massive conditioning.
[01:09:35.438 --> 01:09:37.859]  And again, think about this people, just like with Katrina.
[01:09:38.459 --> 01:09:42.100]  We have 258 million Americans who are supposed to be here.
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:44.021]  How many are unemployed right now?
[01:09:45.327 --> 01:09:48.408]  Now, why is it we need foreign anything coming into this country?
[01:09:48.428 --> 01:10:02.592]  They blocked tens of thousands of firemen and police from going in and helping in Katrina for five days, shut it down, so that FEMA could say, oh, we screwed up, give us more power and funding, but brought in Mexican and Dutch troops into New Orleans.
[01:10:03.033 --> 01:10:03.473]  That's right.
[01:10:03.753 --> 01:10:05.113]  And the Russians were there too.
[01:10:05.193 --> 01:10:10.455]  We have FEMA bus drivers, by the way, Alex, who sat right there on the tarmac at Gulfport,
[01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:16.776]  And watch the Anatovs fly in one after another after another after another.
[01:10:17.397 --> 01:10:18.719]  They were not ready for that.
[01:10:18.779 --> 01:10:20.180]  They were sent to pick up U.S.
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:23.464]  American airborne troops that were supposed to come in to Gulfport.
[01:10:24.005 --> 01:10:25.666]  The troops did not land there.
[01:10:26.127 --> 01:10:32.414]  The buses were left for days wasted because they were not being utilized and could have been used for emergency evacuation.
[01:10:32.984 --> 01:10:38.969]  Instead, they sat and watched the foreign troops come into the United States, plane load after plane load.
[01:10:39.129 --> 01:10:56.862]  And then the first chance they had on flatback trailers, squads of 50 men led by FBI commanders in their black uniforms, led in National Guard and police units from around the country, that's why they had to hold them up for five days, to go into high and dry areas and loot and confiscate guns.
[01:10:57.863 --> 01:10:58.744]  Now, here's the thing.
[01:10:58.824 --> 01:11:01.746]  We can prevent that, and again, this is why we need to organize
[01:11:02.412 --> 01:11:04.514]  Militia on a massive scale.
[01:11:04.574 --> 01:11:10.419]  We already have militia out there, and by the way, Alex, there are tens of millions of people who are well organized and are ready to go.
[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:15.664]  This does not mean that we stop all of the other elements of our program that have to be in place.
[01:11:15.684 --> 01:11:16.725]  Let me give you an example.
[01:11:17.225 --> 01:11:24.212]  Strategically, people, we need currency in the hands of the American people, but it has to be at the tactical level.
[01:11:24.732 --> 01:11:26.854]  When I say tactical, we mean individual.
[01:11:27.515 --> 01:11:27.795]  Why?
[01:11:28.425 --> 01:11:30.745]  Well, America has always invested in America.
[01:11:30.805 --> 01:11:34.826]  The hard currency you are all dispersing now cannot be taken back easily.
[01:11:35.166 --> 01:11:42.148]  But with everybody with gold, silver, and copper in hand, we have the ability to create the treasury of a free America when the time comes, Alex.
[01:11:42.268 --> 01:11:46.228]  We're going to talk behind scenes, and then I promise, folks, nothing but calls for the rest of the interview with Mark Cornyn.
[01:11:46.608 --> 01:11:47.749]  Amazing information.
[01:11:48.189 --> 01:11:53.710]  This guy was set up for seven years, admittedly, for no reason, for what he's telling you now.
[01:11:54.210 --> 01:11:54.970]  We'll be right back.
[01:11:55.050 --> 01:11:55.570]  Stay with us.
[01:11:58.936 --> 01:12:09.060]  Alright Mark, of the four minutes we've got during this break before we go, I promise to Adam and Rusty and Dave and Peggy and others, then before you leave us we'll plug the books and stuff.
[01:12:10.581 --> 01:12:14.822]  Dealing with other issues, because this will be on the web, can you talk about infighting?
[01:12:14.862 --> 01:12:16.683]  Because you know I've always stayed away from infighting.
[01:12:18.224 --> 01:12:26.687]  People try to stir up fights between you and me, we never let that happen, you and I. This is a classic COINTELPRO where they start it and everybody else picks it up.
[01:12:27.307 --> 01:12:35.835]  And then meanwhile, about a third of our movement just spends its time ninnying and having popularity contests and arguing about exactly who's at the top of the pyramid.
[01:12:36.256 --> 01:12:51.270]  How important is it for viewers out there and people listening on the web right now at Infowars.com to understand that we have to keep the info downrange and we have to continue to wake up everybody right now with a unifying message like our lives depend on it.
[01:12:52.128 --> 01:12:53.309]  Well, that is the focus.
[01:12:53.409 --> 01:12:54.710]  Every round needs to go down range.
[01:12:54.750 --> 01:13:00.273]  If you want to attack somebody, pick one of the other guys on the other side and spit on him, defecate on him, do whatever you want.
[01:13:00.694 --> 01:13:04.396]  But make sure it's somebody that we already absolutely know is right there in the crosshairs.
[01:13:04.416 --> 01:13:06.097]  We've got more than enough to choose from.
[01:13:06.697 --> 01:13:08.158]  I mean, take a look at the neocons.
[01:13:08.218 --> 01:13:08.879]  Pick a neocon.
[01:13:08.899 --> 01:13:12.201]  If you really feel brave, go ahead and pick a neocon and just start ragging on him.
[01:13:12.799 --> 01:13:14.360]  Let's put all the fire on the enemy.
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:15.621]  Put all the fire on the enemy.
[01:13:15.761 --> 01:13:18.903]  Oh, by the way, put all the fire on the enemy.
[01:13:18.983 --> 01:13:20.204]  There's no time left.
[01:13:20.324 --> 01:13:23.205]  But you know how the FBI shut down a lot of groups of tell-and-tell pros?
[01:13:23.225 --> 01:13:26.427]  They come in and say, that guy's not good, and they just start a big debate.
[01:13:26.868 --> 01:13:31.351]  And then we spend all our time ninnying instead of warning everybody about what's happening.
[01:13:31.951 --> 01:13:34.893]  Well, again, that comes down to the whole issue of staying focused.
[01:13:34.953 --> 01:13:39.796]  The purpose of your sergeant at arms, so to speak, and the other people is kind of like a sergeant in any situation.
[01:13:40.376 --> 01:13:41.677]  Sergeant had a home guard pike.
[01:13:42.372 --> 01:13:43.333]  Yeah, he actually had a pike.
[01:13:43.373 --> 01:13:45.556]  He didn't have a rifle in a squad.
[01:13:45.997 --> 01:13:49.221]  Even in the Civil War, he had a pistol and he had usually a short sword.
[01:13:49.621 --> 01:13:51.944]  And his job was to keep the squad pointed at the enemy.
[01:13:52.645 --> 01:13:57.511]  And that's really the job of everybody that right now is in the movement if they are serious about this.
[01:13:58.174 --> 01:14:02.555]  Focus on everything downrange, and it's our job to keep reminding everybody we don't have time for this.
[01:14:02.595 --> 01:14:05.836]  There is no time for any kind of nonsense left or right.
[01:14:05.856 --> 01:14:06.897]  Well, you know what I'm talking about?
[01:14:07.017 --> 01:14:10.758]  Endless debates about is it run by the British?
[01:14:10.818 --> 01:14:12.058]  Is it run by the Protestants?
[01:14:12.098 --> 01:14:12.799]  The Catholics?
[01:14:12.819 --> 01:14:13.479]  The Jews?
[01:14:14.119 --> 01:14:16.121]  I mean, that's all they spend their time doing.
[01:14:16.361 --> 01:14:19.583]  When we know all these countries are New World Order run, what's the difference?
[01:14:19.863 --> 01:14:21.224]  We know the Vatican's New World Order.
[01:14:21.244 --> 01:14:23.386]  We know the Protestants are... We know it's all New World Order.
[01:14:23.686 --> 01:14:26.047]  Why not now just try to inform the public?
[01:14:26.468 --> 01:14:33.112]  We're down to the point now where they're talking about youth brigades and the National Guard is going to start gun confiscating in Illinois.
[01:14:33.513 --> 01:14:35.314]  And people don't want to talk about that.
[01:14:35.334 --> 01:14:38.136]  They want to talk about, you know, is it the Black Pope or the Pope?
[01:14:38.196 --> 01:14:41.138]  Or is it the... I mean, my God, we know that it's all bad.
[01:14:41.158 --> 01:14:42.479]  Let's just move against it all!
[01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:45.986]  At this point in time, we agree on 95% of the problem.
[01:14:46.026 --> 01:14:46.527]  Deal with it.
[01:14:46.607 --> 01:14:52.380]  The 5% later is why we have a Congress and why we have rural societies and why we need to get together to debate.
[01:14:53.106 --> 01:14:58.689]  But that's a debate we can do as a common friend, working in a polite environment where we are more peaceful.
[01:14:58.869 --> 01:14:59.689]  Well, it's a sickness.
[01:14:59.749 --> 01:15:01.350]  I mean, they've trained us to infight.
[01:15:01.550 --> 01:15:02.791]  Like, you brought up Survivor.
[01:15:03.311 --> 01:15:15.197]  You know, it's all about how you have a group of ten people, and it's all, screw the smartest person, cut out the leader, so the weak, and the weakest little weasel always ends up at the end, who could just not be noticed, and kind of, ugh.
[01:15:15.757 --> 01:15:16.397]  And that's literal.
[01:15:18.178 --> 01:15:21.399]  Pavlovian social dog training, and I'm glad you brought that up.
[01:15:21.739 --> 01:15:25.741]  And so the people out there need to think, why have you been trained to infight with everyone?
[01:15:26.061 --> 01:15:29.782]  Why have you been trained to do all of this?
[01:15:30.642 --> 01:15:34.664]  Instead, the whole idea is, we've all, again, this goes back to the generation war.
[01:15:34.704 --> 01:15:37.345]  Multi-generationalism was part of the strength of our people.
[01:15:37.925 --> 01:15:41.686]  Grandpa taught the grandchildren, just as he taught his children.
[01:15:41.906 --> 01:15:44.547]  Dad helped by reinforcing that Grandpa was right.
[01:15:45.188 --> 01:15:55.436]  Between the three, they were able to teach effectively good government, the concepts of liberty, good banking practices, understand through experience that we don't have to get burned on the stove.
[01:15:55.556 --> 01:15:57.877]  Dad and Grandpa already experienced, or Grandpa did.
[01:15:58.057 --> 01:16:12.368]  And Grandpa, Dad, and the sons all loved each other, went fishing, camping, worked together, family was everything, and now they've trained people just to let the government take their kids, and the family just sits there like lobotomized rats, letting them take their babies.
[01:16:12.428 --> 01:16:13.049]  I mean, wake up!
[01:16:13.069 --> 01:16:13.449]  Here we go!
[01:16:15.947 --> 01:16:18.109]  Deadlines and commitments.
[01:16:37.588 --> 01:16:44.749]  You know, I have everybody on my show, and I really appreciate Mark coming on, but we have everybody on this show that keeps their ammo down at the enemy.
[01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:46.770]  Keeps the fire going right at the enemy.
[01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:51.991]  Everybody on who's building and teaching people they can stand up and that you have strength and honor and will.
[01:16:53.051 --> 01:16:57.112]  We don't have the people on, though, whose websites are all about attacking everybody else in the movement.
[01:16:57.572 --> 01:17:00.413]  Those people need to not be attacked, ignored.
[01:17:00.813 --> 01:17:02.333]  Move forward, the time is short.
[01:17:03.632 --> 01:17:07.195]  Hi Alex, I'd just like to thank you for everything, but I was wondering what you know about this year's Bohemian Grove?
[01:17:25.319 --> 01:17:32.503]  There's a few local news articles, they confirm what Paul Watson reported on, that Obama's dropping by, Bush Sr.
[01:17:32.623 --> 01:17:33.184]  and Jr.
[01:17:33.204 --> 01:17:42.349]  are there, and McCain, all staged, and all, I guess, cementing their... I mean, that's really where a lot of the New World Order stuff gets done.
[01:17:42.409 --> 01:17:50.794]  Kissinger admits that, the head of the Kissinger Group admits it, a lot of them admit it, of drug-taking, alcohol, and homosexual orgies.
[01:17:51.674 --> 01:17:56.137]  As Richard Nixon said, we have him in major newspapers now, and of course the tape released.
[01:17:58.218 --> 01:17:59.538]  It is like the Romans.
[01:18:01.997 --> 01:18:02.638]  Bizarre.
[01:18:02.698 --> 01:18:04.079]  I mean, who could make this up, Mark?
[01:18:04.099 --> 01:18:11.465]  I'd hear that 15 years ago and didn't believe it, and now it's just admitted that, yeah, they're all there or dropping by for the next 10 days.
[01:18:11.665 --> 01:18:13.127]  It goes from the 15th to the 30th.
[01:18:13.807 --> 01:18:18.431]  So I guess the next 12 days or so, having orgies.
[01:18:19.372 --> 01:18:20.793]  Mark, the challenge would be this.
[01:18:21.013 --> 01:18:29.681]  If supposedly Osama bin Laden is any different from McLean, then how is it that this separate institution is having all of them at the same place at the same time?
[01:18:30.598 --> 01:18:35.604]  This demonstrates what we've argued for years, and again, to remember, the Democrats and Republicans.
[01:18:35.664 --> 01:18:36.745]  The difference between the two?
[01:18:37.466 --> 01:18:45.656]  If the Democrats proposed to burn down the Library of Congress today, the Republicans would propose to phase it in over a three-day period.
[01:18:47.034 --> 01:18:54.341]  And that was the case with Clinton and before, but now the Republicans would say incinerated in a half a second and the Democrats would say, we agree.
[01:18:54.601 --> 01:19:02.849]  I mean, they're for the war, they're for every program, they act like they're not, they've been blocking impeachment of Bush, I mean, and I've got Democrats
[01:19:03.630 --> 01:19:08.994]  I've gotten some emails here, you know, saying, how dare you talk bad about Obama?
[01:19:09.314 --> 01:19:10.435]  You're a fear monger.
[01:19:10.755 --> 01:19:12.336]  He's not proposing youth corps.
[01:19:12.396 --> 01:19:17.399]  And then you've got, we've got him on tape admitting, I mean, it's, of course, it's not him running anything.
[01:19:17.459 --> 01:19:18.680]  Like, they don't understand.
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:20.521]  I'm not even arguing about Obama.
[01:19:20.722 --> 01:19:21.602]  He runs nothing.
[01:19:21.642 --> 01:19:22.563]  He is no one.
[01:19:22.923 --> 01:19:23.884]  Everybody's freaking out.
[01:19:23.904 --> 01:19:25.104]  There's a lot of racists or mad.
[01:19:25.125 --> 01:19:26.205]  Oh, a black guy might be in.
[01:19:26.505 --> 01:19:33.130]  Folks, if we had a black president who was a patriot and would fight the New World Order, I mean, I wouldn't care if he was black and his whole cabinet was black.
[01:19:34.110 --> 01:19:35.271]  Well, here's the thing, guys.
[01:19:35.291 --> 01:19:36.612]  They're meat puppets, okay?
[01:19:36.652 --> 01:19:38.472]  Here's the way to look at what we're seeing right now.
[01:19:39.213 --> 01:19:45.296]  They literally have given you what is the CFR's agenda for the next shyster who will be president, okay?
[01:19:45.756 --> 01:19:47.237]  No matter which base it is.
[01:19:47.797 --> 01:19:56.541]  In fact, this whole thing, this announcement about this latest KGB interior police force that they're going to put together on top of Homeland Security,
[01:19:57.111 --> 01:20:04.521]  On top of local police, county police, state police, ATF, FBI, DEA, Homeland Security, Fire Department, and Security.
[01:20:05.101 --> 01:20:06.483]  Let's go right on down the list guys.
[01:20:06.503 --> 01:20:07.484]  The bat-faggots are there too.
[01:20:07.644 --> 01:20:09.367]  All of these, and we're going to put more?
[01:20:10.219 --> 01:20:12.921]  Well, remember, we told everybody about Homeland Security in the mid-90s.
[01:20:12.961 --> 01:20:13.702]  It was in the documents.
[01:20:13.922 --> 01:20:14.723]  We got laughed at.
[01:20:14.763 --> 01:20:15.303]  There it is.
[01:20:15.864 --> 01:20:18.066]  We told you it would come after a staged terror attack.
[01:20:18.426 --> 01:20:19.086]  Again, we're right.
[01:20:19.127 --> 01:20:20.868]  We told you you'd have $4 gas by this summer.
[01:20:21.088 --> 01:20:21.769]  Again, we're right.
[01:20:21.929 --> 01:20:22.389]  We're right.
[01:20:22.429 --> 01:20:22.890]  We're right.
[01:20:22.930 --> 01:20:23.350]  We're right.
[01:20:23.390 --> 01:20:23.790]  We're right.
[01:20:24.011 --> 01:20:26.513]  Because we're not just making this stuff up.
[01:20:26.533 --> 01:20:29.195]  We're going off of enemy blueprints that are public.
[01:20:29.475 --> 01:20:29.976]  Correct, Mark?
[01:20:29.996 --> 01:20:31.817]  The other thing, just a real quick reminder.
[01:20:32.177 --> 01:20:35.620]  Homeland Security, what was its name, guys, for everybody listening out there?
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:37.422]  This has been several years now.
[01:20:38.231 --> 01:20:41.092]  Homeland Security's name wasn't Homeland Security.
[01:20:42.272 --> 01:20:43.973]  What was its name when it first came out?
[01:20:44.033 --> 01:20:47.494]  Everybody think it was Heartland Security.
[01:20:48.915 --> 01:20:50.355]  Now, where did that come from?
[01:20:50.935 --> 01:20:54.056]  Back in 1995, when the Mossad and the U.S.
[01:20:54.096 --> 01:21:04.060]  government planned the Oklahoma City bombing and executed it, what they had 25 days beforehand is the entire Patriot Act was sent to Washington through the GPO, Government Printing Office.
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:04.660]  How do we know?
[01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:05.360]  We got copies.
[01:21:06.047 --> 01:21:07.267]  By the way, Mark, I remember you
[01:21:25.646 --> 01:21:30.089]  Talking about, I mean just so many things that ended up happening, it's just amazing.
[01:21:30.409 --> 01:21:37.653]  Stay there, we're gonna go ahead and take this break and then come back with Adam if he has anything else, Rusty, Dave, Peggy, Hal and others.
[01:21:37.693 --> 01:21:38.633]  Gotta move fast folks.
[01:21:38.893 --> 01:21:39.334]  Here we go.
[01:21:47.758 --> 01:21:50.420]  You know what, we don't have time to waste, let's just keep going.
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:51.921]  We're still going right?
[01:21:53.331 --> 01:21:59.052]  I wanted to say this to the full audience, and then I decided not to because I didn't think we had time, but I'll come back and talk about it.
[01:22:00.153 --> 01:22:04.594]  I remember you and others on air saying the Southern Poverty Law Center was involved.
[01:22:05.154 --> 01:22:06.974]  And I remember you saying you had sources.
[01:22:06.994 --> 01:22:08.434]  I remember this like 10 years ago.
[01:22:08.895 --> 01:22:10.815]  No, no, it was like 12, 13 years ago.
[01:22:10.895 --> 01:22:13.936]  It was like back in 96, 97 when I first started tuning in to you.
[01:22:13.956 --> 01:22:16.136]  You know, I was on the air separately and then found you, Mark.
[01:22:16.396 --> 01:22:17.457]  It was all through osmosis.
[01:22:17.497 --> 01:22:18.797]  We were, you know, connected to other people.
[01:22:19.877 --> 01:22:32.300]  But I remember you talking about that, and then it came out, as you know, two years ago in FBI documents, and now it's been in major papers, that the Southern Poverty Law Center was running the Elohim City Nazi camp.
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:41.903]  We already knew that with Strassmeier, and he was CIA, but to know that they really were running the founders and people controlling it as kind of one of the central nodes for the setup,
[01:22:42.823 --> 01:22:50.469]  But I wanted to talk about how did you know at the time, because you didn't even say ADL, that you said Southern Poverty Law Center, if you remember that.
[01:22:50.910 --> 01:22:54.633]  Well, one of the reasons we had sources, first of all, one of the things to remember is patterns.
[01:22:54.853 --> 01:23:01.218]  One of the things I was watching was the specific cyclic pattern with regard to who was presenting information in advance.
[01:23:02.319 --> 01:23:08.444]  What they did is they pre-printed and they pre-generated the material and they had to shoot it out to their assets and affiliates.
[01:23:09.096 --> 01:23:15.242]  Southern Perversion Law, Southern Poverty Law, was the group that was doing all of the ground coordinating from behind the scenes.
[01:23:15.822 --> 01:23:32.718]  Some of the satellite feeds, in fact, we have where literally they got so frustrated they turned and they slathered at the camera and literally blurted out what they wanted because, in fact, they threw the sponsor, the host of the program, aside, literally brushed him aside
[01:23:33.248 --> 01:23:36.149]  And look right at the camera and the demon in them literally came out.
[01:23:36.209 --> 01:23:47.091]  This is videotaped in several different situations where they became so frustrated because they had orchestrated it, engineered it, and it didn't go the way it was supposed to where they were going to tweak both sides.
[01:23:47.651 --> 01:23:54.533]  A lot of people, law enforcement was supposed to stumble into this, but they stepped back and said, wait a minute, something's not right here.
[01:23:55.093 --> 01:23:57.333]  From our side, we already knew what the game was.
[01:23:57.473 --> 01:23:58.713]  We already knew what they were doing.
[01:23:58.753 --> 01:24:01.214]  So all we had to do is say, hey, ask a basic question.
[01:24:01.570 --> 01:24:04.509]  And we went right down the shopping list of what it is that they were up to.
[01:24:05.205 --> 01:24:10.227]  They didn't anticipate that because their logic is somehow we were going to just fumble into a we hate, but we don't hate America.
[01:24:10.247 --> 01:24:13.909]  Yeah, Mark, I just want to commend the incredible foresight and knowledge.
[01:24:13.949 --> 01:24:32.016]  I mean, what you've put out has always been so amazingly accurate, and I really think of all the analysts out there, you are the best when it comes to overall general knowledge, and I agree so much with your idea of general knowledge, and that's the type of knowledge I have, and then being able to assess the larger picture.
[01:24:32.336 --> 01:24:34.357]  We're going to come back into the full broadcast here.
[01:24:35.197 --> 01:24:37.639]  And try to run through as many calls as we can.
[01:24:37.679 --> 01:24:38.159]  Okay, Mark?
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:39.841]  Absolutely.
[01:24:39.901 --> 01:24:41.362]  By the way, real quick with Strauss-Meyer.
[01:24:41.402 --> 01:24:56.813]  Remember, this last three years, it was acknowledged by Germany that they have been giving out blank passports to the Israelis, and that they have been creating fictional identities utilizing real people to bring Israeli Mossad personnel into the United States.
[01:24:56.933 --> 01:24:57.414]  All right, here we go.
[01:24:57.434 --> 01:25:04.359]  Strauss-Meyer was supposedly a German, but nobody has been able to, you'll notice, nobody's been able to track him down or find him.
[01:25:05.017 --> 01:25:05.137]  Yeah.
[01:25:05.157 --> 01:25:07.859]  Well, I thought his dad was a prominent SS officer.
[01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:10.301]  By the identity of the person, yes.
[01:25:10.722 --> 01:25:14.585]  But here's the thing, you'll notice nobody has gone... They could have multiple doppelgangers.
[01:25:14.605 --> 01:25:15.746]  We gotta go back on the main show.
[01:25:15.846 --> 01:25:16.186]  Here we go.
[01:25:18.088 --> 01:25:20.670]  Red, white, and blue.
[01:25:20.710 --> 01:25:21.891]  Red, white, and blue.
[01:25:22.852 --> 01:25:27.115]  And when the band plays, hell to the chief, Lord knows.
[01:25:27.536 --> 01:25:29.797]  They point their cannon at you.
[01:25:38.643 --> 01:25:41.728]  By the way, major Bohemian Grove development since you asked.
[01:25:41.848 --> 01:25:44.473]  Vanity editor Alex Jones.
[01:25:47.677 --> 01:25:49.879]  Showmanoff busted at Bohemian Grove.
[01:25:50.539 --> 01:25:55.743]  Vanity Fair contributing editor was arrested this week after he tried to sneak into the world-famous Bohemian Grove.
[01:25:56.163 --> 01:25:57.844]  People Magazine tried, everybody else did.
[01:25:57.864 --> 01:26:06.391]  The exclusive getaway of some of the world's most powerful men to gather there every year in July for two weeks, the San Francisco Chronicle reports.
[01:26:07.091 --> 01:26:08.212]  So we've got all these articles.
[01:26:08.232 --> 01:26:10.093]  They're going up on JonesReport.com.
[01:26:10.113 --> 01:26:11.674]  Aaron is putting them up right now.
[01:26:11.714 --> 01:26:15.255]  You know, people also overestimate the power of the New World Order.
[01:26:15.275 --> 01:26:16.536]  They're not omnipresent.
[01:26:16.776 --> 01:26:17.797]  They're not all powerful.
[01:26:17.817 --> 01:26:19.358]  Some say, I'm an agent, Marcus.
[01:26:20.118 --> 01:26:25.281]  Agents don't run around for decades telling you how to fight the New World Order and you have power and you're good and you're strong.
[01:26:25.561 --> 01:26:29.663]  They try to get you to be Nazis or they try to get you to act in a way that's unpopular.
[01:26:29.683 --> 01:26:34.506]  They try to get you to hide in the bushes and try to get you to be paranoid of everyone and end up going to jail.
[01:26:35.166 --> 01:26:37.748]  Okay, they try to set people up like they've set Mark up.
[01:26:38.508 --> 01:26:42.651]  That's what they do, and they judge a tree by its fruits.
[01:26:42.691 --> 01:26:45.053]  They don't energize the population and say, take action.
[01:26:45.293 --> 01:26:47.375]  People say, Alex couldn't have snuck into Bohemian Grove.
[01:26:48.191 --> 01:26:52.913]  Well, I snuck in about eight years after the last people got arrested trying to sneak in.
[01:26:52.933 --> 01:26:56.054]  I went in with Mike Hanson and I didn't know until I got in.
[01:26:56.074 --> 01:27:03.576]  I knew something about the gay porn stars and male prostitutes they bring in, but I wasn't thinking when I snuck in.
[01:27:05.117 --> 01:27:05.197]  Yes.
[01:27:22.179 --> 01:27:22.940]  Real good-looking.
[01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:24.461]  Mike's not a bad-looking guy.
[01:27:24.541 --> 01:27:29.065]  I didn't know at the time, but they thought we were male prostitutes.
[01:27:29.105 --> 01:27:32.348]  It's kind of embarrassing, but that's the only reason we made it.
[01:27:32.388 --> 01:27:33.730]  We got questioned by Secret Service.
[01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:36.012]  I knew enough about the Grubbs.
[01:27:36.912 --> 01:27:39.074]  We're with the, what camp did I say?
[01:27:40.276 --> 01:27:41.337]  What's the name of the Bush camp?
[01:27:41.837 --> 01:27:42.417]  The Hillbillies.
[01:27:43.218 --> 01:27:45.742]  And then I got questioned by the sheriff of the county.
[01:27:45.762 --> 01:27:46.283]  He was there.
[01:27:46.723 --> 01:27:47.965]  And then I said, this is too dangerous.
[01:27:47.985 --> 01:27:49.147]  We hid in the woods till dark.
[01:27:49.407 --> 01:27:52.992]  Then snuck out and got the ritual on tape that supposedly happened every 15th.
[01:27:53.954 --> 01:27:55.075]  And it did happen on time.
[01:27:55.356 --> 01:27:56.838]  And then we got out of there.
[01:27:57.078 --> 01:27:57.359]  Then...
[01:27:58.917 --> 01:28:00.098]  We made copies of the tapes.
[01:28:00.158 --> 01:28:01.920]  The British watched us make copies of the tapes.
[01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:03.682]  Those were mailed, erased.
[01:28:03.742 --> 01:28:06.484]  Another group were erased.
[01:28:07.025 --> 01:28:10.308]  We made copies and carried them on our person, checked bags.
[01:28:10.508 --> 01:28:12.550]  Those got erased.
[01:28:13.231 --> 01:28:13.971]  Mark, that's another thing.
[01:28:14.031 --> 01:28:17.935]  People can't believe that we can actually infiltrate enemy operations.
[01:28:18.135 --> 01:28:21.799]  I was able to do it and people just can't believe that I could have some success, Mark.
[01:28:22.338 --> 01:28:22.938]  Well, here's the thing.
[01:28:22.978 --> 01:28:29.943]  First of all, remember, command-and-control personnel are basically the people that the enemy targets for control and manipulation.
[01:28:30.483 --> 01:28:38.228]  In the General Staff War College, they focus on, the CFR focuses on, general staff command-and-control personnel.
[01:28:38.268 --> 01:28:40.270]  They don't get the whole command structure.
[01:28:40.710 --> 01:28:46.254]  Their logic is that if they use the hourglass system and they go to the choke points, they can manipulate.
[01:28:46.294 --> 01:28:47.835]  This is how 9-11 took place.
[01:28:48.595 --> 01:28:51.057]  If you have the command-and-control people under your thumb,
[01:28:51.491 --> 01:28:54.874]  Everybody else follows orders under the assumption that somebody's going to do something right.
[01:28:55.414 --> 01:29:03.420]  As each second ticks by and they perceive that something is going wrong, then people have to make decisions to either do the right thing or just follow along like sheep.
[01:29:04.081 --> 01:29:15.470]  And that's where the change took place in the later stages of 9-11, when one field commander or another finally did send aircraft to intercept, even though Washington told him to stand down, I am sure.
[01:29:16.010 --> 01:29:19.513]  Remember, this is hard for people to understand because they do not
[01:29:19.969 --> 01:29:21.249]  Deal with military personnel.
[01:29:21.329 --> 01:29:31.632]  At one point I could brag that I met about 78% of all the general staff officers and had briefed them in the military, the US Army, I won't say the Navy, Marine Corps, whatever.
[01:29:32.172 --> 01:29:39.233]  But I had met and briefed at one time or another many, many general staff officers because of the nature of my job and some of the positions that I held.
[01:29:39.973 --> 01:29:47.195]  Now, most of these men you could sit down if they were in plainclothes and they were just as normal as everybody else and you could pick the nutcases out in a heartbeat.
[01:29:48.228 --> 01:29:50.758]  And I mean nut cases, the ones that are the fruit loops that are with the CFR.
[01:29:51.724 --> 01:29:57.466]  The men who are normal men have stood up and have actually been the ones putting the brakes on this at different times.
[01:29:57.626 --> 01:29:57.887]  Absolutely.
[01:29:57.907 --> 01:30:01.248]  We've got to go to calls, but I just wanted to add that I also forgot one thing.
[01:30:01.308 --> 01:30:06.010]  It turned out with the People Magazine thing that they had a rat inside People that blew the whistle.
[01:30:06.310 --> 01:30:14.433]  I think that's another reason I was able to infiltrate was because I wasn't with a major magazine that would report, and I didn't even trust the British media.
[01:30:14.453 --> 01:30:15.554]  They even put this in their film.
[01:30:15.994 --> 01:30:20.676]  I didn't tell them what I was going to do and broke off and did something else because my instinct told me to do it.
[01:30:21.860 --> 01:30:24.823]  The rodents are actually, that's for him, they're designed to be gatekeepers.
[01:30:24.963 --> 01:30:30.968]  Even the fact this story is in the controlled press right now remembers to scare everybody with the idea that, oh, don't go and look at them, they'll grab you.
[01:30:31.048 --> 01:30:39.175]  Well, the whole point is, is that contrary to what everybody thinks... You're saying maybe people getting caught has been staged?
[01:30:39.876 --> 01:30:40.916]  Oh, yes, absolutely.
[01:30:40.956 --> 01:30:44.920]  The idea behind getting people caught is to terrify... Remember, for years before you went in, Alex,
[01:30:45.464 --> 01:31:00.112]  The most common story that was used, and I'm telling you this from personal experience, was, well, you know, if the state police, even the highway patrol, the chips are up there, a couple of them got grabbed, and they were stripped naked, and they were raped, and they were molested for six or seven days, and thrown back on the highway naked.
[01:31:00.572 --> 01:31:08.656]  Now, that was to terrorize the police, the sheriff's department, everybody who's not a spit-swapper or a ring-knocker, into thinking, oh my goodness, whatever you do, don't go there.
[01:31:09.076 --> 01:31:11.978]  Imagine if everybody right now listening treated this like V.
[01:31:13.010 --> 01:31:16.653]  And everybody just turned and walked upon that site and converged.
[01:31:17.794 --> 01:31:18.475]  What could they do?
[01:31:19.876 --> 01:31:20.797]  What really could they do?
[01:31:20.817 --> 01:31:22.498]  What, are they going to nuke their own site?
[01:31:22.518 --> 01:31:23.740]  I mean, come on, think about it, people.
[01:31:23.780 --> 01:31:28.143]  What if everybody stood there on the road with cameras and just looked at them and pointed to them and said, we see you.
[01:31:28.984 --> 01:31:30.305]  And we see you for what you are.
[01:31:30.325 --> 01:31:36.591]  Well, what if at zero hour boats were landing and people were scaling and coming in from all directions and in on the main road?
[01:31:37.011 --> 01:31:37.652]  They could do nothing.
[01:31:38.083 --> 01:31:48.987]  Well, I think it's just the idea that they're terrified of the idea that people will look at them and not be fearful, because this is what this whole thing is based upon, and it doesn't mean that they aren't wicked and evil and can't do bad things, but they're thugs.
[01:31:49.247 --> 01:31:55.329]  The whole thing is based on the idea that people will not understand that the only strength we have ever had is free men and women.
[01:31:56.053 --> 01:32:00.094]  Is for all of us to stand together against darkness.
[01:32:12.118 --> 01:32:19.241]  By one of the back entrances after we've been walking around all day and I saw David Gergen and other people coming in and out and I would go up and do interviews.
[01:32:19.281 --> 01:32:20.382]  They're not gods.
[01:32:20.762 --> 01:32:24.424]  And so if you want to go confront these people, go to the RNC, go to the DNC.
[01:32:24.444 --> 01:32:25.664]  Don't act like protesters.
[01:32:25.964 --> 01:32:27.325]  Just be walking along with your camera.
[01:32:27.385 --> 01:32:28.485]  You will run into them.
[01:32:28.785 --> 01:32:32.967]  We saw Ann Coulter, but I was about to go in so I didn't want to get stopped so I didn't go up to her.
[01:32:33.607 --> 01:32:34.388]  But the point is,
[01:32:35.288 --> 01:32:37.629]  That again, people see me with these little exploits.
[01:32:37.669 --> 01:32:39.490]  I mean, it's not that big of a deal to sneak in the Grove.
[01:32:39.890 --> 01:32:44.733]  Not that big a deal to confront David Gergen or George Bush at the time I got arrested for doing it.
[01:32:44.873 --> 01:32:47.154]  It's just, it took going and doing it.
[01:32:47.834 --> 01:32:54.057]  Instead, they will, you know, develop some conspiracy theory about, I staged that with David Gergen.
[01:32:54.298 --> 01:32:56.259]  Oh yeah, I had him blow up at me about rituals.
[01:32:56.679 --> 01:33:00.921]  You know, again, folks, you have to get focused and engaged in the info war now.
[01:33:01.581 --> 01:33:04.803]  Rusty in Arkansas, you're on the air with Mark Corenkey, gotta move fast, go ahead.
[01:33:06.109 --> 01:33:09.791]  Hey Mark, I just wanted to ask you a couple questions.
[01:33:09.811 --> 01:33:12.192]  Spiritually speaking, are you a saved individual?
[01:33:12.493 --> 01:33:12.713]  Yes.
[01:33:13.273 --> 01:33:19.337]  Okay, and my second question is, regarding the timeline of Bible prophecy, where do you think we stand?
[01:33:20.317 --> 01:33:26.601]  Well, my problem with the whole idea of trying to write ourselves into the end world here is the idea that back when the American Revolution...
[01:33:27.887 --> 01:33:28.968]  Yeah, it's a jettison.
[01:33:29.068 --> 01:33:32.970]  It's the idea I can sit on my hands and let the world go by and let the devil take over.
[01:33:33.110 --> 01:33:33.791]  I argue this.
[01:33:33.871 --> 01:33:39.354]  Anybody who is cooperating and thinking we need to just let things slide is going to go to hell because they're helping out with the devil.
[01:33:39.414 --> 01:33:40.915]  No, I'm just telling everybody flat out my point.
[01:33:40.955 --> 01:33:44.797]  Guaranteed, folks, you are with the devil if you're not fighting this.
[01:33:45.038 --> 01:33:45.978]  You are with the evil.
[01:33:46.178 --> 01:33:49.801]  These fake Christians going, oh, praise the Lord, they're putting ships in people.
[01:33:50.021 --> 01:33:53.463]  That means I'm going to get a golden rope out of here real soon.
[01:33:54.123 --> 01:34:03.367]  Yeah, here's the thing I would tie into that, Revelation 13, taking the mark as a divorce from Christ, which means that we under no circumstances can accept or allow it, we have to fight it.
[01:34:04.107 --> 01:34:10.590]  And that doesn't mean putting your head on a block and letting them chop it off, that means fighting tooth and nail because we must resist evil, period.
[01:34:11.230 --> 01:34:12.111]  That's my position.
[01:34:12.151 --> 01:34:12.991]  And the bottom line is,
[01:34:13.593 --> 01:34:18.914]  Anybody who's doing this way, and I know you're asking a question, but I'm going to elaborate on this because it is critical.
[01:34:18.994 --> 01:34:19.975]  Well, let me just say this.
[01:34:20.015 --> 01:34:23.155]  They're also saying there's hundreds of verses that are going to be raptured out.
[01:34:23.235 --> 01:34:23.936]  That's made up.
[01:34:24.216 --> 01:34:26.916]  It says the beast will make war on the saints and overcome them.
[01:34:27.256 --> 01:34:31.737]  How are there going to be saints here if they were all raptured out five minutes before?
[01:34:32.017 --> 01:34:33.678]  I mean, I'm sick of the cop-out.
[01:34:33.878 --> 01:34:38.039]  That wasn't taught until Schofield 130 years ago, and it's pure bull.
[01:34:38.399 --> 01:34:52.724]  Well, in part of the defense process, my argument is this, is that one way or another, okay, if we have nothing to fear, and we are going to have to have faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, we are going to have to stand as warriors, we are going to have to stand as free men in liberty, and free women in liberty, too.
[01:34:52.784 --> 01:34:54.604]  And women, you need to support your men in this.
[01:34:55.344 --> 01:35:00.366]  I have had many soldiers, and I stand with them in a situation where we have no choice but to fight.
[01:35:00.806 --> 01:35:02.106]  We cannot go with them anymore.
[01:35:02.327 --> 01:35:06.948]  We cannot agree and placate them by letting them have their way.
[01:35:07.577 --> 01:35:12.580]  We must fight them tooth and nail, and the Founding Fathers understood their place in time and history.
[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:16.341]  And even though they tried to claim that they weren't Christian, that's all nonsense.
[01:35:16.422 --> 01:35:17.822]  No king but King Jesus.
[01:35:18.463 --> 01:35:22.124]  That was a battle cry for many of the militia... Yeah, I mean, there were some... ...who fought hard and won.
[01:35:22.164 --> 01:35:26.607]  There were some, you know, deists and a few others in there, but that was the minority.
[01:35:27.267 --> 01:35:32.490]  They tried to claim they were atheists or something because they didn't want a government-run church like we have today with the 501c3.
[01:35:32.550 --> 01:35:33.050]  Rusty, anything else?
[01:35:35.382 --> 01:35:37.883]  Oh yeah, I just want to say your best friend Tex believes in the Rapture.
[01:35:37.903 --> 01:35:38.544]  We'll talk to you later.
[01:35:38.584 --> 01:35:38.824]  Bye-bye.
[01:35:39.664 --> 01:35:39.984]  Hoorah!
[01:35:40.685 --> 01:35:41.205]  There you go.
[01:35:41.225 --> 01:35:43.306]  I think I ought to have Tex Mars on.
[01:35:43.326 --> 01:35:47.228]  You may have been reading some book you wrote 20 years ago, but that's not what I believe Tex says.
[01:35:47.548 --> 01:35:48.308]  I just know this.
[01:35:48.449 --> 01:35:50.950]  All the Rapture people, and I don't get into this stuff.
[01:35:51.030 --> 01:35:51.810]  I don't talk about it.
[01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:52.651]  You brought it up here.
[01:35:52.991 --> 01:35:55.092]  They all tell me they're not doing anything!
[01:35:55.652 --> 01:36:00.137]  They all tell me it's not their job, and praise the Lord it's getting bad, because that means it's the end.
[01:36:00.437 --> 01:36:01.458]  Well, you know what?
[01:36:01.478 --> 01:36:02.399]  You're going to take all of it.
[01:36:02.419 --> 01:36:08.866]  You're going to take the Casual Society, you're going to go along, because you keep looking to be raptured, and so this can't be the devil, because I'm not being raptured.
[01:36:08.886 --> 01:36:12.050]  The Bible says they're going to worship the devil as Jesus.
[01:36:12.490 --> 01:36:14.212]  He's going to show up and say he's it.
[01:36:14.453 --> 01:36:16.475]  They're going to think they're raptured and go along with it.
[01:36:17.015 --> 01:36:22.198]  If you cooperate with this, you are cooperating with the devil's plan, so how can you claim to be in the light?
[01:36:36.064 --> 01:36:40.406]  Just say it's the rapture, but you better warn children that they're given a mercury in the vaccines.
[01:36:40.626 --> 01:36:43.007]  You better warn people they're putting cancer viruses in.
[01:36:43.508 --> 01:36:47.410]  I demand you spend your time doing that instead of chattering about the rapture.
[01:36:47.690 --> 01:36:49.271]  Now, I'm not getting mad at you, sir.
[01:36:49.311 --> 01:36:50.751]  I'm talking about other people out there.
[01:36:51.091 --> 01:36:52.732]  Mark, you understand my frustration, don't you?
[01:36:52.752 --> 01:36:54.893]  Here's one of the things I would point out.
[01:36:55.073 --> 01:36:58.575]  Number one is, we were given a gift from God called liberty.
[01:36:59.416 --> 01:37:04.098]  We have an obligation as free men and women to protect that liberty interest.
[01:37:04.861 --> 01:37:06.502]  Our liberty interest is a real thing.
[01:37:06.542 --> 01:37:10.223]  It is a defense of our time on this planet, which is also a gift from God.
[01:37:10.903 --> 01:37:16.706]  Those who wish to fail in that action will fail utterly, and I do believe will be punished accordingly for it.
[01:37:16.746 --> 01:37:18.847]  And oh, there's going to be ranting and raving over that.
[01:37:18.947 --> 01:37:23.389]  And notice, I'm just flat out telling you, bottom line, the Founding Fathers understood this.
[01:37:23.989 --> 01:37:26.910]  Go to a book called They Preached Liberty.
[01:37:27.870 --> 01:37:31.732]  The ten years of sermons leading up to the American Revolution.
[01:37:31.992 --> 01:37:34.714]  It's called, They Preached Liberty.
[01:37:34.794 --> 01:37:38.576]  And it was pastors in the pulpits with their guns, saying, let's go out and get it on.
[01:37:39.176 --> 01:37:39.577]  That's right.
[01:37:39.597 --> 01:37:43.639]  In other words, if we're going to have to fight, let's get it over with, because we're going to get on with life.
[01:37:43.979 --> 01:37:45.360]  I'm going to challenge everybody to this.
[01:37:45.740 --> 01:37:54.245]  There were people that went into the ministries in Russia before the Communist Revolution, so that they could undermine the people, and they told them then,
[01:37:54.910 --> 01:38:00.733]  In the 1920s, that this was the end of the world and that they might as well just lay down and let them murder everybody.
[01:38:00.773 --> 01:38:01.353]  And you know what?
[01:38:01.893 --> 01:38:05.895]  A bunch of people were stupid enough to believe that, and they murdered for 70 years.
[01:38:05.955 --> 01:38:06.956]  And wait a minute, hold on here.
[01:38:08.391 --> 01:38:10.552]  I'm still breathing and we're all still around, people.
[01:38:10.652 --> 01:38:13.793]  And they told the Christians that in Germany.
[01:38:14.374 --> 01:38:14.894]  That's right.
[01:38:14.994 --> 01:38:19.416]  In other words, Hitler's the antichrist, don't fight back, go to the death camp.
[01:38:20.076 --> 01:38:21.217]  And the problem is this, guys.
[01:38:21.257 --> 01:38:21.897]  Here's the thing.
[01:38:21.977 --> 01:38:25.879]  The enemy knows the nature of the goodness of our teachings.
[01:38:26.299 --> 01:38:29.340]  And they are trying to use, they are word twisters.
[01:38:30.301 --> 01:38:34.723]  Utilizing the twisting of words, they are boring you into a death march.
[01:38:35.353 --> 01:38:38.154]  Instead, Christ died to give us life.
[01:38:38.934 --> 01:38:45.316]  Life that we must preserve, we must embrace, and liberty, which is our birthright.
[01:38:46.297 --> 01:38:51.879]  To surrender that is, again, as it says in Revelation, is as a divorce from Christ.
[01:38:52.799 --> 01:38:54.379]  Our liberty is a gift from God.
[01:38:54.439 --> 01:38:56.460]  The Founding Fathers all understood this.
[01:38:56.940 --> 01:38:59.181]  We have a natural right to defend ourselves.
[01:38:59.621 --> 01:39:04.843]  We have a bunch of creatures that are parasitic predators that we are going to have to defend ourselves from.
[01:39:05.706 --> 01:39:09.128]  All of you need to rise up and shine, people.
[01:39:09.168 --> 01:39:11.769]  You need to be in the sunlight, in the daylight.
[01:39:12.049 --> 01:39:15.210]  Not exposing yourselves for fields of fire, guys.
[01:39:15.250 --> 01:39:16.751]  We know how to use cover and concealment.
[01:39:17.391 --> 01:39:20.513]  But the bottom line is to be the best warrior you possibly can be.
[01:39:20.553 --> 01:39:23.554]  To be a soldier against those who would steal our liberty.
[01:39:24.094 --> 01:39:28.316]  Men, cough and find your body parts and make sure they don't go plop plop on the floor there.
[01:39:29.065 --> 01:39:34.186]  Women, support your men because it's our job to defend the people of this nation.
[01:39:34.246 --> 01:39:35.986]  We are the sword and shield of liberty.
[01:39:36.367 --> 01:39:37.427]  We are the militia.
[01:39:38.107 --> 01:39:47.009]  And if you do not support the militia, then you will become slaves in chains and your children have the right to urinate on your graves for failing to protect them.
[01:39:48.349 --> 01:39:51.650]  That is where we are headed if we do not stand up now.
[01:39:52.130 --> 01:39:54.850]  And it means putting your foot down and telling them enough is enough.
[01:39:54.890 --> 01:39:56.151]  We are going to protect the borders.
[01:39:56.291 --> 01:39:57.491]  We are going to clean up the country.
[01:39:57.884 --> 01:40:11.606]  We are going to defend it from any invader that is foolish enough to put his boot on this country and a Canadian soldier that is used against America shall be incinerated and only a rumor of his death will go back to Canada or go to anywhere where these scumbags come from.
[01:40:11.707 --> 01:40:18.808]  Only a rumor of their demise will be sent back and they will understand that the warriors of America are some of the most terrible to deal with.
[01:40:19.508 --> 01:40:25.469]  And yet we can be the greatest friends on the planet if you are smart, if you're intelligent and wise and deal with us fairly.
[01:40:27.549 --> 01:40:28.770]  Rise up and shine, people.
[01:40:47.634 --> 01:40:49.075]  Oh, I can stay whatever time you need me.
[01:40:59.654 --> 01:41:00.935]  Okay, I know it's exhausting.
[01:41:00.955 --> 01:41:06.959]  I've been skipping all the breaks all day, and I'm going into overdrive, folks, but this is the burning we have for liberty.
[01:41:07.079 --> 01:41:09.080]  Because I know once the hammer drops, it's all over.
[01:41:09.781 --> 01:41:11.702]  And believe me, we're not happy about this.
[01:41:11.782 --> 01:41:13.043]  Mark's not happy about this.
[01:41:13.063 --> 01:41:19.467]  You know, he's a guy, small-town Michigan, dad and uncles all in the police department, sheriff's department, you know, military veteran.
[01:41:19.487 --> 01:41:20.588]  We just love this country.
[01:41:20.908 --> 01:41:23.270]  We know what the evil is, and we faced it.
[01:41:23.690 --> 01:41:28.715]  And they faced it decades ago when they first learned about it in secret, you know, inside the government.
[01:41:29.076 --> 01:41:30.577]  Now, can you face it?
[01:41:31.118 --> 01:41:38.465]  I mean, I want to come back and go to calls, but right now, Mark, I mean, talking to cops out there, I don't dislike them personally.
[01:41:38.725 --> 01:41:42.969]  I'm mad at the tyranny and how they've been trained to act, but I mean, this is going to destroy them too!
[01:41:43.310 --> 01:41:46.173]  Just as sure as the sun came up this morning, can you speak directly to them?
[01:41:46.833 --> 01:41:50.034]  And a man who is a peace officer has my respect.
[01:41:50.294 --> 01:41:57.717]  A person who wishes to be nothing but a policy enforcement officer slash a revenuer needs to go back and look at the history of this nation.
[01:41:58.337 --> 01:42:00.918]  There's a lot of good men that are listening right now that know what I mean.
[01:42:00.958 --> 01:42:09.001]  If you took up the uniform, you have an obligation to specific spiritual policies that have been part of this nation since its inception.
[01:42:09.701 --> 01:42:12.462]  And that means that you're also part of the shield and the sword.
[01:42:12.942 --> 01:42:14.903]  You're supposed to be protecting and defending.
[01:42:15.382 --> 01:42:16.883]  Not occupying and taking.
[01:42:17.704 --> 01:42:20.446]  That is the difference between a good man and a parasite.
[01:42:21.046 --> 01:42:23.408]  Now we have a lot of good men out there listening right now.
[01:42:23.949 --> 01:42:26.891]  You guys can make this nation the greatest nation on this planet.
[01:42:27.011 --> 01:42:32.035]  Not a police state, not an oppressive state, but a great nation that can be built upon.
[01:42:32.295 --> 01:42:34.857]  We can look to the stars instead of looking into the mud.
[01:42:35.956 --> 01:42:39.880]  We have the opportunity now, but you're all going to have to stand together, and you all have to decide.
[01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:45.866]  When they give you a bad order, you shoot the bugger that gives you the bad order, and hunt the one down that sent him the order, too.
[01:42:46.507 --> 01:42:47.227]  All right, stay there.
[01:42:47.247 --> 01:42:48.128]  We're going to talk behind the scenes.
[01:42:48.168 --> 01:42:50.511]  By the way, let's dig up Visitor from the Past.
[01:42:50.531 --> 01:42:52.332]  We'll end the show with that.
[01:42:53.033 --> 01:42:54.394]  Can you IM that to the network?
[01:42:55.896 --> 01:42:57.397]  Well, just however we can get it to the network.
[01:42:57.418 --> 01:42:57.638]  Here we go.
[01:42:59.924 --> 01:43:01.986]  Okay, Mark, let's continue with calls.
[01:43:02.026 --> 01:43:06.269]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dave in California, then Hal, Heather, Paige, and others.
[01:43:06.629 --> 01:43:08.130]  Dave, you're on the air with Mark Hornke.
[01:43:09.011 --> 01:43:10.272]  Hi guys, this is great, man.
[01:43:10.292 --> 01:43:18.638]  I'm on the radio with my two favorite people, and I got Mark, my 9-11 truth brother here, who's the guy that sent you the Hendrix DVD and the disc.
[01:43:18.658 --> 01:43:19.318]  I hope you got them.
[01:43:19.378 --> 01:43:19.679]  Thank you.
[01:43:20.598 --> 01:43:20.858]  Good.
[01:43:21.038 --> 01:43:21.339]  Excellent.
[01:43:21.719 --> 01:43:22.320]  I got one thing.
[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:22.940]  I know I got some.
[01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:25.603]  I don't know if you were saying that was for Mark, but I got some too, but go ahead.
[01:43:25.763 --> 01:43:26.464]  No, they were for you.
[01:43:26.484 --> 01:43:27.725]  I didn't send any to Mark.
[01:43:27.785 --> 01:43:28.345]  No offense, Mark.
[01:43:28.946 --> 01:43:30.567]  Well, Mark gets a lot of stuff too, but go ahead.
[01:43:30.908 --> 01:43:31.188]  Okay.
[01:43:31.228 --> 01:43:32.409]  Well, anyway, I was just going to say this.
[01:43:32.529 --> 01:43:38.355]  If you want to see a model of what it's going to look like when the shooting actually starts, look at the cowards
[01:43:38.777 --> 01:43:44.141]  At the rainbow gathering and how people just started walking at him and they utterly panicked and fell back in disarray.
[01:43:44.201 --> 01:43:46.623]  Kept shooting at people and people just kept marching forward.
[01:43:46.703 --> 01:43:48.625]  The wicked fleeth when none pursueth.
[01:43:48.905 --> 01:43:49.486]  That's right.
[01:43:49.666 --> 01:43:53.028]  And I mean, you know, here you got a bunch of guys, you know, screaming, get on the ground now!
[01:43:53.088 --> 01:43:55.050]  And everybody's just walking toward him.
[01:43:55.090 --> 01:43:56.231]  Nobody's getting on the ground.
[01:43:56.710 --> 01:43:58.291]  You know, I mean, that's the way it's going to happen.
[01:43:58.331 --> 01:44:03.336]  And that's liberal hippies making the police, literally, the land grab.
[01:44:03.356 --> 01:44:05.898]  But you see, those park rangers are a special breed of evil.
[01:44:05.958 --> 01:44:06.999]  Not all of them, but most of them.
[01:44:07.219 --> 01:44:08.160]  Kind of like BATF.
[01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:14.446]  Some agencies are really bad, because they've been occultists, earth worshippers, weirdos for decades.
[01:44:14.486 --> 01:44:17.308]  They've really infiltrated into the park service, haven't they, Mark?
[01:44:18.089 --> 01:44:19.150]  Yes, as a matter of fact.
[01:44:19.190 --> 01:44:22.593]  Remember, we demonstrated in this, well, we touched on this at the very beginning of the program.
[01:44:23.243 --> 01:44:25.764]  With the whole idea of the international biospheres.
[01:44:25.804 --> 01:44:33.848]  The international biospheres do not have the protections that all of these contracts and restrictions had with our National Park Service.
[01:44:33.868 --> 01:44:36.209]  And that's why they transferred them over as real estate.
[01:44:37.069 --> 01:44:38.230]  These characters know this.
[01:44:38.410 --> 01:44:46.754]  If they're going to get in with the bulldozers and the backhoes, and they're going to get in and take the raw materials, they had to get around the sovereignty of the United States.
[01:44:47.188 --> 01:44:48.909]  And the sovereignty of the respective states.
[01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:50.431]  And that's really what this is all about.
[01:44:50.471 --> 01:44:52.112]  They're not going to protect the deserts.
[01:44:52.132 --> 01:44:53.393]  They're not going to protect the mountains.
[01:44:53.934 --> 01:44:55.195]  They're not going to protect anything.
[01:44:55.235 --> 01:44:56.796]  And these are just isolated pods.
[01:44:57.196 --> 01:45:01.300]  But they realize that there's pristine resources there that they could pilfer and take.
[01:45:01.740 --> 01:45:02.601]  And that's the focus.
[01:45:02.641 --> 01:45:04.002]  That's where they're headed with this.
[01:45:06.064 --> 01:45:11.668]  Germany was agitated into World War II because the French were such arrogant occupiers.
[01:45:11.708 --> 01:45:14.991]  And they were doing nothing but being foreclosure officers for the banksters.
[01:45:15.649 --> 01:45:17.130]  They came in and they took everything.
[01:45:17.170 --> 01:45:20.972]  They shot train crews because train crews wouldn't let anything leave Germany anymore.
[01:45:21.532 --> 01:45:30.596]  This evacuation corridor was like literally cutting an artery and watching blood puddle on the floor in somebody else's house or somebody else's room.
[01:45:30.616 --> 01:45:32.597]  And it was your lifeblood.
[01:45:32.657 --> 01:45:38.320]  Well, the same thing is going to happen here and it's all been documented because when they went to the Rio Treaty, 22,000 pages guys,
[01:45:40.146 --> 01:45:52.613]  In the middle of that was an acknowledgement that in 1977, because of the oil prices, we had transferred our national parks as real estate and property and collateral to the IMF for national debt.
[01:45:53.994 --> 01:45:55.735]  That's how they got into the national parks.
[01:45:55.755 --> 01:45:58.597]  Remember the signs, Alex, that they turned around backwards?
[01:45:59.737 --> 01:46:01.939]  Oh, listen, listen, we're going back a lot right now.
[01:46:01.959 --> 01:46:02.359]  Here we go.
[01:46:03.359 --> 01:46:03.980]  Absolutely.
[01:46:06.365 --> 01:46:10.207]  Mark Kornke was just bringing up the National Park people, or a bunch of globalists.
[01:46:10.668 --> 01:46:11.788]  Not all of them, but the leaders.
[01:46:12.729 --> 01:46:14.790]  This is when I first had only been on the air a few years.
[01:46:15.250 --> 01:46:17.152]  I show up in 97 because there were U.N.
[01:46:17.472 --> 01:46:18.953]  Park signs saying the U.N.
[01:46:19.033 --> 01:46:19.293]  owned it.
[01:46:19.573 --> 01:46:22.035]  I had the treaties, state governments had tried to throw it out.
[01:46:22.735 --> 01:46:26.057]  And I showed up at the Grand Canyon, and the lady came running out and said, I'm going to arrest you.
[01:46:26.597 --> 01:46:28.719]  And started trying to put me in handcuffs, basically.
[01:46:28.759 --> 01:46:29.960]  It's all in footage, on tape.
[01:46:30.380 --> 01:46:31.741]  In America Destroyed by Design.
[01:46:32.041 --> 01:46:33.722]  I mean, they were acting so guilty.
[01:46:35.211 --> 01:46:41.755]  I mean, it's kind of like a cop shows up in your backyard and somebody's shooting fireworks off to tell you to stop it, and then you say, there's no dead bodies buried under here.
[01:46:42.296 --> 01:46:42.556]  Mark?
[01:46:44.457 --> 01:46:45.157]  What dead bodies?
[01:46:45.197 --> 01:46:45.918]  What are you talking about?
[01:46:45.958 --> 01:46:46.238]  What?
[01:46:46.918 --> 01:46:47.979]  Exactly.
[01:46:48.039 --> 01:46:48.640]  I didn't kill her.
[01:46:49.700 --> 01:46:50.741]  She's not buried right there.
[01:46:52.162 --> 01:46:55.544]  Well, here's a quick one for everybody, and everybody will recognize this document.
[01:46:55.604 --> 01:47:01.928]  Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light or transient causes, and accordingly, all experiences shown
[01:47:02.512 --> 01:47:13.179]  That mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.
[01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:26.088]  But when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object envisions a design to reduce them to under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty,
[01:47:26.894 --> 01:47:29.435]  To throw off such government.
[01:47:42.521 --> 01:47:46.504]  And others that are holding there, Hal, Heather, and Paige.
[01:47:46.544 --> 01:47:49.767]  I promise I'll get to you right when the show starts, the overdrive of 30 minutes.
[01:47:49.827 --> 01:47:53.850]  Then we'll get to my uncle and closing comments from Mark Kornke.
[01:47:53.890 --> 01:47:57.213]  But before we end, Mark, fire out... Are you still there, Mark?
[01:47:58.373 --> 01:47:59.695]  Oh, I think he's... Oh, great.
[01:47:59.935 --> 01:48:02.437]  Give out your website for folks to get your book.
[01:48:02.517 --> 01:48:03.918]  You just put a book out.
[01:48:04.483 --> 01:48:10.588]  LibertyTreeRadio.4mg.com.
[01:48:11.349 --> 01:48:14.411]  Battle for the Republic, The Winter War Book 2 is part of a series.
[01:48:14.491 --> 01:48:15.592]  It's $25.
[01:48:16.173 --> 01:48:20.976]  We also have the How to Organize a Militia, PM 8-94.
[01:48:21.557 --> 01:48:25.480]  This is part of a series on how to get your operations in place.
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:26.481]  It's designed to promote
[01:48:27.026 --> 01:48:29.829]  A vast militia corps in a short period of time.
[01:48:29.849 --> 01:48:32.753]  We're going to spend more time on that in the next 30 minutes.
[01:48:32.773 --> 01:48:34.234]  We're going to call you right back right now, Mark.
[01:48:34.254 --> 01:48:35.095]  Hoorah!
[01:48:35.155 --> 01:48:35.836]  Okay, here we go.
[01:48:36.117 --> 01:48:38.359]  I've got some sponsors I've got to plug before the show ends.
[01:48:38.980 --> 01:48:42.664]  The show continues on the web at InfoWars.com here in about three minutes.
[01:48:42.924 --> 01:48:47.249]  And for all the people saying we're going to be raptured, why don't you read the Bible for yourself, okay?
[01:48:48.030 --> 01:48:51.873]  Because I've just had enough of it, and it's destroying our movement.
[01:48:52.533 --> 01:48:56.116]  And even if that was the case, you don't have an excuse to stand by.
[01:48:56.416 --> 01:49:02.020]  Let me tell you about eFoods Direct, the best horrible foods company out there in the country.
[01:49:02.381 --> 01:49:04.202]  The longest continually operating.
[01:49:04.622 --> 01:49:06.023]  They are just fabulous folks.
[01:49:06.063 --> 01:49:09.446]  They've got a free audio CD about their products, what they do, and brochures.
[01:49:09.906 --> 01:49:10.747]  Give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:49:14.049 --> 01:49:14.449]  1-800-409-5633.
[01:49:15.189 --> 01:49:20.291]  I've got a storable food from them four separate times, given it to family and stockpiled it myself.
[01:49:20.391 --> 01:49:22.912]  It's non-GMO, high quality.
[01:49:23.332 --> 01:49:24.112]  Give them a call.
[01:49:24.352 --> 01:49:26.733]  You'll never stand in the bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:49:26.753 --> 01:49:27.433]  1-800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com.
[01:49:27.713 --> 01:49:28.073]  Fabulous!
[01:49:28.093 --> 01:49:28.414]  Wonderful!
[01:49:36.636 --> 01:49:43.098]  Good people, and the New World Order hates you being prepared, hates you having storable foods, and they've got water filters and a lot more.
[01:49:43.118 --> 01:49:45.719]  800-409-5633 are huge.
[01:49:45.999 --> 01:49:51.681]  Banners at the top of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:49:52.282 --> 01:49:56.283]  And also, the best green food out there anywhere is inner food.
[01:49:56.323 --> 01:49:57.424]  There is no doubting it.
[01:49:57.864 --> 01:50:00.965]  Wonderful folks get 10% off their healthy coffees, Cocos.
[01:50:01.245 --> 01:50:03.766]  There are two scoops a day of inner food in your drinks.
[01:50:04.386 --> 01:50:06.747]  My wife takes it every morning, was raving about it this morning.
[01:50:06.807 --> 01:50:07.988]  I've got to get her on tape.
[01:50:09.109 --> 01:50:10.189]  It is very affordable.
[01:50:10.729 --> 01:50:14.992]  10% off when you tell them you're an Alex Jones listener by linking through at Infowars.com to Interfood.
[01:50:15.232 --> 01:50:17.953]  You get that at Interfood.com, Interfood.com or 1-866-762-9238, 1-866-762-9238, Interfood.com.
[01:50:17.973 --> 01:50:20.154]  Be sure and join us for this very special
[01:50:28.959 --> 01:50:30.060]  We only do this every few weeks.
[01:50:30.500 --> 01:50:39.688]  Overdrive with Mark Kornke, my uncle William Hammond, and your phone calls starting right now at InfoWars.com and InfoWars only.
[01:50:39.708 --> 01:50:41.390]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:50:41.970 --> 01:50:44.652]  Be sure to visit GCN.com today.
[01:50:46.539 --> 01:50:49.122]  All right, John, great job.
[01:50:49.543 --> 01:50:50.084]  Thank you, Jones.
[01:50:50.104 --> 01:50:50.925]  We'll talk to you on Monday.
[01:50:50.965 --> 01:50:51.665]  I'll see you tomorrow.
[01:50:51.746 --> 01:50:52.907]  Fabulous job.
[01:50:53.127 --> 01:50:53.628]  Take care.
[01:50:53.848 --> 01:50:54.449]  All right, take care.
[01:50:54.709 --> 01:51:01.097]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to take a 30-second break while we line up Kornke, Mr. Hammond, and your phone calls.
[01:51:01.678 --> 01:51:03.660]  Could I ever give those poor callers the number to call in on?
[01:51:05.391 --> 01:51:06.872]  Well, we'll get to whoever can get in.
[01:51:06.992 --> 01:51:08.573]  Throw our studio number up for me.
[01:51:09.113 --> 01:51:10.874]  I haven't memorized that even in the last three months.
[01:51:10.894 --> 01:51:19.277]  888-201-2244, 888-201-2244, or 512-646-5400, because I guess if most of those callers are listening on AM and FM, they probably aren't listening on the web to hear this now.
[01:51:19.297 --> 01:51:21.878]  512-646-5400, 888-201-2244, and we will come right back after...
[01:51:33.812 --> 01:51:37.036]  The intro music here for everybody.
[01:51:37.396 --> 01:51:39.039]  Let's go, give me some Flight of the Valkyries.
[01:51:40.100 --> 01:51:41.642]  Ah, Starship Troopers, even better.
[01:51:42.262 --> 01:51:45.186]  While we line up Mark Kornke and of course my uncle.
[01:51:45.226 --> 01:51:45.847]  We got both of them?
[01:51:47.409 --> 01:51:48.090]  Where'd both go?
[01:51:49.571 --> 01:51:50.713]  Okay, we got both of them, good.
[01:51:52.927 --> 01:51:54.148]  Alright, we're in overdrive.
[01:51:54.188 --> 01:51:58.193]  The main radio show on the satellite shortwave AM and FM dial is over.
[01:51:58.213 --> 01:52:02.177]  I'm going to have Mark back up next week because I want him to plug his book really good.
[01:52:02.197 --> 01:52:03.098]  We were out of time there.
[01:52:03.879 --> 01:52:15.451]  But he'll plug it today before he leaves in the next 30 minutes for everybody who is patiently out there listening to us today.
[01:52:17.011 --> 01:52:22.757]  But right now, let's go ahead and introduce my uncle, and let's bring him up with Mark Kornke.
[01:52:22.777 --> 01:52:23.898]  Mark, I have you there, correct?
[01:52:27.085 --> 01:52:28.306]  Oh, we've got my uncle.
[01:52:28.326 --> 01:52:29.566]  Okay, go ahead and get Corky on, too.
[01:52:30.127 --> 01:52:30.387]  Alright?
[01:52:30.407 --> 01:52:33.188]  Let me go ahead and bring my uncle up right now.
[01:52:34.049 --> 01:52:49.196]  I know you were busy working out on the farm when I called you, and my aunt ran out and got you with the cordless phone, brought you in, but were you listening to the guy who just kind of added at the end, you know, there's going to be a rapture, you know, basically we're all absolved from waking people up?
[01:52:52.798 --> 01:52:53.979]  Maybe I don't have callers.
[01:52:54.419 --> 01:52:55.360]  I don't know what's going on.
[01:52:57.571 --> 01:52:58.992]  I thought he told me I had my callers.
[01:53:00.312 --> 01:53:01.092]  I'm just not clear.
[01:53:01.453 --> 01:53:02.773]  Do I have my uncle there?
[01:53:04.134 --> 01:53:07.075]  This was kind of an unannounced deal to go into overdrive today, folks.
[01:53:07.095 --> 01:53:12.377]  Sometimes this is a little bit bumpy here as we switch from a studio in Minnesota down to Mission Control here.
[01:53:13.457 --> 01:53:16.778]  Do we have him?
[01:53:18.559 --> 01:53:19.339]  That's Mark Kornke.
[01:53:19.380 --> 01:53:20.380]  I have Mark Kornke, correct?
[01:53:23.168 --> 01:53:24.589]  Probably something to do with our system in here.
[01:53:24.609 --> 01:53:26.109]  I've got one guy doing the job of eight people.
[01:53:26.450 --> 01:53:30.752]  Well, let me go ahead and give you some of the important news while we're lining all of this out.
[01:53:32.873 --> 01:53:36.214]  Barack Obama calls for National Civilian Stasi.
[01:53:36.734 --> 01:53:39.316]  Presidential candidate wants domestic security forces.
[01:53:39.396 --> 01:53:40.036]  Powerful.
[01:53:40.976 --> 01:53:41.237]  Hello.
[01:53:41.477 --> 01:53:43.998]  Yeah, there's Mark.
[01:53:44.098 --> 01:53:45.519]  Hey, what's going on?
[01:53:46.299 --> 01:53:47.339]  I'm waiting to go on the air.
[01:53:48.060 --> 01:53:49.661]  Yeah, I've got you both here.
[01:53:49.681 --> 01:53:51.021]  People have been in here for a while.
[01:53:51.041 --> 01:53:52.342]  I don't know if they can hear me.
[01:53:57.709 --> 01:53:58.691]  This is bad, man.
[01:54:00.233 --> 01:54:01.916]  Okay, guys, we got you both on air.
[01:54:01.956 --> 01:54:02.376]  Are you there?
[01:54:02.657 --> 01:54:03.198]  We gotcha.
[01:54:03.438 --> 01:54:03.678]  I'm here.
[01:54:04.384 --> 01:54:08.148]  Okay, yeah, other folks do shows out of the studio and, well, let's just say it's not pretty.
[01:54:09.449 --> 01:54:11.731]  That's why I just got to ban everybody from being in my studio.
[01:54:12.071 --> 01:54:13.233]  I'll start a network sometime.
[01:54:13.253 --> 01:54:17.216]  I'll have separate studios for everybody so they don't sabotage my equipment in here and change things.
[01:54:17.597 --> 01:54:26.205]  All right, I have my uncle and Mark Corky on together with that fun, that's good radio, it's like old-fashioned radio, you know, by the seat of our pants.
[01:54:26.445 --> 01:54:27.926]  Mark Corky, good to have you back on with us.
[01:54:27.946 --> 01:54:29.168]  Thank you, Alex, appreciate that.
[01:54:29.648 --> 01:54:31.549]  You bet, and my uncle William Hammond.
[01:54:31.569 --> 01:54:32.750]  I want to address this first.
[01:54:32.810 --> 01:54:38.914]  Mark already addressed it, but I want to go back to him after my uncle deals with it, because he's one of the best Bible scholars I know out there.
[01:54:39.635 --> 01:54:43.417]  He goes right to what the Bible says, and Schofield and the disinfo they put out.
[01:54:43.937 --> 01:54:46.839]  They told the Russians, they told the Germans, lay down.
[01:54:47.180 --> 01:54:54.865]  Stalin's the Antichrist, Lenin's the Antichrist, Hitler's the Antichrist, Pol Pot's the Antichrist, hundreds of thousands of Christians he killed in Cambodia.
[01:54:55.085 --> 01:54:57.106]  It's always lay down, don't fight evil.
[01:54:57.146 --> 01:54:57.586]  Romans 13 and
[01:54:58.827 --> 01:54:59.767]  It's a rapture.
[01:55:00.027 --> 01:55:01.068]  You're going to be raptured.
[01:55:01.108 --> 01:55:04.668]  Now, we can attack this from two places.
[01:55:04.748 --> 01:55:09.209]  It's your moral duty to warn people, even if there is a rapture, pre-tribulation.
[01:55:09.849 --> 01:55:11.170]  But we know the Bible doesn't say that.
[01:55:11.210 --> 01:55:21.492]  But even if it is, if there is a pre-tribulation rapture, it's still wicked to not warn people about evil and to fight back against it and just run around in fancy outfits at church acting official.
[01:55:22.272 --> 01:55:26.093]  So my uncle, William Hammond, will you deal with that for people just briefly here?
[01:55:26.946 --> 01:55:27.546]  Yes, Alex.
[01:55:27.806 --> 01:55:36.090]  The New Testament is now 2,000 years old, but there was no reference to a pre-tribulation rapture until recently.
[01:55:36.750 --> 01:55:42.053]  Around 1790, there was a Catholic priest who advanced this doctrine in his writings.
[01:55:42.733 --> 01:55:55.639]  And then about 1830, a man in England who was a member of the Plymouth Brethren Church, his name was Darby, took up this doctrine, originally evidenced by the Catholic priest,
[01:55:56.320 --> 01:55:57.420]  And began to publish it.
[01:55:57.500 --> 01:56:07.023]  And a young lady in his group named Marie MacDonald had some ecstatic experiences and prophesied that there was a pre-tribulation rapture.
[01:56:07.563 --> 01:56:10.844]  This doctrine was imported into the United States where C.I.
[01:56:10.864 --> 01:56:15.125]  Schofield, around 1900, wrote his C.I.
[01:56:15.165 --> 01:56:23.927]  Schofield's Reference Bible, which became almost like scripture to many denominations who picked up the idea because it sounded good.
[01:56:24.505 --> 01:56:27.446]  We all know the damage that's resulted from this false doctrine.
[01:56:27.766 --> 01:56:29.687]  Here's what the Bible says in truth.
[01:56:30.627 --> 01:56:33.328]  In chapter 24 in the New Testament, St.
[01:56:33.368 --> 01:56:45.112]  Matthew, verse 29, immediately after the tribulation of those days, shall the sun be darkened, the moon not give her light, and stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.
[01:56:45.672 --> 01:56:51.074]  And then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven, and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn,
[01:56:51.821 --> 01:56:56.485]  As they see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
[01:56:57.265 --> 01:56:58.226]  And this is the point.
[01:56:58.666 --> 01:57:08.734]  And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect, that's the believers, from the four winds that is all over the earth and from one end of heaven to the other.
[01:57:08.794 --> 01:57:16.800]  So here clearly it states that the gathering up to the marriage supper of the Lamb in the heavens
[01:57:17.381 --> 01:57:17.761]  Okay, let's
[01:57:47.771 --> 01:57:52.717]  Then shall two be in the field, and one shall be taken, and the other left.
[01:57:52.877 --> 01:57:57.203]  The idea here is that Noah was not raptured out of the world.
[01:57:57.836 --> 01:58:02.478]  The world ended in a terrible flood of total destruction, but Noah... Well, let me interrupt.
[01:58:02.538 --> 01:58:26.591]  I mean, you're getting into all the technical, and that's good, but the whole revelation in Daniel, and a five-year-old can understand it, it says the beast comes in, he says he's Jesus, people that don't go along with it, the saints, he comes after and starts slaughtering, but that they then cause a huge awakening because of their voice in the world, but then the New World Order comes in and says, no, there won't be any voice of Christians during this, because they'll all be gone.
[01:58:27.051 --> 01:58:29.493]  I mean, a five-year-old can figure out this is pure bull.
[01:58:29.673 --> 01:58:31.114]  Let me get a comment from Mark Hornke.
[01:58:31.454 --> 01:58:34.937]  Well, again, the perfect problem is this.
[01:58:34.997 --> 01:58:39.700]  People would say, well, because I'm going to be jettisoned out, the ejection seat policy, I don't have to do anything.
[01:58:39.780 --> 01:58:41.161]  Well, here, I'll reverse that on them.
[01:58:41.901 --> 01:58:51.208]  If they truly believe this, give me your money, give me your cars, give me your clothing, I'll create a place called the Lilies of the Field Warehouse.
[01:58:52.066 --> 01:58:57.990]  And you can walk in sackcloth and you can enjoy each other's company until such time as all you leave are the sacks behind.
[01:58:58.791 --> 01:59:03.894]  But you'll notice that most of these people who do this don't think they want to join in that policy.
[01:59:04.495 --> 01:59:20.426]  And again, it's a convenient, the old term is cop-out for the last 30 years, but the bottom line is, it is a failing to meet the responsibility of a human being on this earth, put here by God, who is given an opportunity to act in whatever, you know, we have an option here,
[01:59:21.169 --> 01:59:24.341]  Either act accordingly the way you're supposed to or be slothful.
[01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:30.825]  My attitude is that anybody who wants to set aside like this wants to be slothful.
[01:59:30.965 --> 01:59:32.246]  This is the great contest.
[01:59:32.286 --> 01:59:35.929]  This is the one time you're alive in this plane to stand up against evil.
[01:59:35.969 --> 01:59:37.611]  The enemy is totally into evil.
[01:59:37.851 --> 01:59:39.252]  They know where they're getting their power.
[01:59:39.472 --> 01:59:42.875]  They tell the world they're atheists when they're totally obsessed with religion.
[01:59:43.315 --> 01:59:45.537]  And then here we are seeing it all being fulfilled.
[01:59:45.918 --> 01:59:49.160]  And in the Bible, a five-year-old, literally, it's right there.
[01:59:49.601 --> 01:59:52.243]  And you've got all these cowards who are in denial.
[01:59:52.523 --> 01:59:55.385]  I want to go back to my uncle, and then get Cornkey to comment again on that.
[01:59:55.885 --> 01:59:56.445]  Give us more.
[01:59:56.485 --> 02:00:02.148]  I mean, what about my comments, just as a layman, where it says the beast wages war against the saints?
[02:00:02.188 --> 02:00:06.350]  I mean, it's all there, and you've got to take the mark, and he's chopping Christians' heads off.
[02:00:06.771 --> 02:00:10.213]  And then they just say, oh no, that doesn't exist, oh no, everything's fine.
[02:00:10.393 --> 02:00:14.655]  But in reality, he comes and says he's Jesus, and the fakes follow him.
[02:00:14.735 --> 02:00:16.836]  That's going to be all these mainline churches.
[02:00:17.617 --> 02:00:22.059]  Well, the hypocrites and the heretics have lots of convoluted, ancillary doctrines.
[02:00:22.557 --> 02:00:30.082]  That they used to back up the false doctrine of the pre-tribulation rapture, as you have just talked about.
[02:00:30.122 --> 02:00:35.966]  But let me finish real quick with this reference in the Old Testament from Matthew 24.
[02:00:36.807 --> 02:00:43.532]  As in the days of Noah, while the world was being destroyed, the true believers were in the ark in the flood above.
[02:00:44.132 --> 02:00:48.395]  They went through the trouble, they went through the tribulation, they went through the destruction,
[02:00:49.048 --> 02:00:56.133]  And because they were faithful, they were brought through alive to the New Kingdom, and that's exactly what's going to happen to we, the believers.
[02:00:56.193 --> 02:01:05.479]  We're going to be here, we're going to fight, we're going to build the ark, we're going to sweat and use elbow grease and do what we can to get ready, and then God will take care of the rest.
[02:01:05.999 --> 02:01:14.125]  And what it says finally in verse 40 is that, "...then shall two be in the field, the one shall be taken and the other left."
[02:01:14.365 --> 02:01:16.086]  The one who's taken is the wicked.
[02:01:16.584 --> 02:01:19.005]  The one who is remaining is the righteous.
[02:01:19.505 --> 02:01:22.267]  And that's the true truth of post-tribulation doctrine.
[02:01:24.347 --> 02:01:27.289]  And there again, we have an opportunity here, as I've said, to build.
[02:01:27.349 --> 02:01:30.450]  But the biggest, you know, let's think about this for a second, guys.
[02:01:30.510 --> 02:01:46.077]  How many times, in how many ways in Hollywood, or Hollyweird, as courses we actually call it, or in books, or in all these publications created by our enemy, have they told us that we just need to throw out our Christian philosophy, our Christian belief, our Christian teachings,
[02:01:46.676 --> 02:01:49.159]  And it's interesting that, but never theirs, of course.
[02:01:49.359 --> 02:01:50.821]  Always we have to bend to them.
[02:01:51.322 --> 02:01:54.466]  Now, people would say, well, that's because Christianity doesn't have any strength.
[02:01:54.586 --> 02:01:54.906]  Really?
[02:01:55.367 --> 02:02:05.099]  Then why has our enemy spent so much resource and so much time to try and defeat the works and writings of Jesus Christ?
[02:02:06.511 --> 02:02:11.795]  Because when you call upon his authority, I can bring person after person... Well, I mean, look at the founding fathers.
[02:02:11.935 --> 02:02:18.779]  Look at Captain Bly and their 21-foot boat with 18 guys, with enough food for one day, living 41 days.
[02:02:18.799 --> 02:02:22.162]  And they have the letters and the accounts of that.
[02:02:22.522 --> 02:02:24.844]  Over and over again, it said, we've got to make account of ourselves.
[02:02:25.464 --> 02:02:28.727]  Give a hundred percent and then God may provide.
[02:02:28.967 --> 02:02:33.872]  You know, it's the faith of stepping out on the battlefield and committing to the cause of good.
[02:02:34.233 --> 02:02:36.174]  Then God comes to your aid.
[02:02:36.715 --> 02:02:41.980]  You know, it isn't just let's dress up in fancy outfits and go to a church like a bunch of painted trollops.
[02:02:43.121 --> 02:02:46.705]  I want to get a take from Kornke and then Mr. Hammond on that.
[02:02:47.546 --> 02:02:49.347]  Well, again, we have an opportunity.
[02:02:49.507 --> 02:02:52.510]  We're at the point where we have to decide to put our money where our mouth.
[02:02:52.550 --> 02:02:56.792]  I think that's the biggest problem people have, is it's nice to watch a movie from the sidelines.
[02:02:57.473 --> 02:03:02.657]  It's not necessarily the most fun to be part of the movie or part of the experience.
[02:03:02.697 --> 02:03:08.781]  In other words, the history of the true events that make up history, because there is a lot of blood, sweat, and tears involved.
[02:03:08.821 --> 02:03:16.026]  But the exciting thing is, for those who participate, is that the rewards are so great, and they're not monetary rewards.
[02:03:16.775 --> 02:03:31.321]  There is a point where you realize you've done something right, where you realize that you've been part of something that was gifted to you as an opportunity through God, and that you've actually stepped forward, and your medal has been tested, and you win.
[02:03:32.102 --> 02:03:39.965]  And even if we fall, guys, here, think about this, for everybody out there listening, even if we were to fall, doesn't it say that we come back with the legions that defeat the enemy?
[02:03:41.306 --> 02:03:42.566]  What fear do we have?
[02:03:42.806 --> 02:03:44.507]  What fear can we possibly have?
[02:03:44.567 --> 02:03:46.108]  What fear can our enemy strike in us?
[02:03:46.582 --> 02:03:53.590]  I know, count after count, guys, where men have been threatened by demons, you know, cult worshippers in the military.
[02:03:53.930 --> 02:03:55.852]  I've seen this firsthand.
[02:03:55.872 --> 02:04:05.383]  And each case, the man stood right there and called upon the authority and the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, and it was like the swine that had the demons in them.
[02:04:05.483 --> 02:04:06.264]  They fled!
[02:04:07.679 --> 02:04:16.988]  Yeah, for those that don't know, the military, it's all over the news here, is just filled with Satanists now, and it's true, they are scared to death of us.
[02:04:17.408 --> 02:04:32.462]  And it's so simple, here's the thing, what was said about Faust years ago, remember the old story, Faustus, Faustus, thou art damned, Faustus, and again, each step when he wanted to change the contract, because all he had to do was call upon the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[02:04:33.175 --> 02:04:36.759]  Instead, the demon would threaten him, and he would think the devil had more power.
[02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:39.202]  But when hell opened up, what did they do?
[02:04:39.262 --> 02:04:46.810]  They came up and they laughed, as they dragged him into perdition, because they said, at any time, you could have left us.
[02:04:47.271 --> 02:04:52.056]  At any time, you could have walked away, and we could do nothing about it.
[02:04:52.600 --> 02:04:55.382]  But you gave authority to the wrong being.
[02:04:55.442 --> 02:04:59.565]  You gave authority to the devil instead of giving authority to that who deserved it.
[02:04:59.825 --> 02:05:01.846]  Let me go back to my uncle.
[02:05:02.367 --> 02:05:12.033]  Why do these people that go to the mainline churches, I mean, they are willfully blind, and then once they're given over to the blindness, they're blind to Bush, they're blind to all of it.
[02:05:13.334 --> 02:05:14.314]  They just cling to this.
[02:05:14.374 --> 02:05:17.977]  Is it just too scary to them to know they're going to have to go through this?
[02:05:18.477 --> 02:05:19.498]  There's an answer to that.
[02:05:19.938 --> 02:05:31.627]  The Pre-Tribulation Rapture Doctrine is a hypocritical doctrine that appears to those who want to appear spiritual, but who want to indulge, walk, and live after the flesh.
[02:05:32.367 --> 02:05:37.691]  Every day, in the believer, it's a war between the flesh and the spirit.
[02:05:38.252 --> 02:05:43.075]  And like Solomon says in Proverbs, there is no discharge in this war.
[02:05:44.556 --> 02:05:45.517]  There is no retirement.
[02:05:47.096 --> 02:05:47.556]  That's right.
[02:05:47.737 --> 02:05:49.098]  Exactly what we've said for years.
[02:05:49.118 --> 02:06:00.428]  There's no retiring from the Patriot Movement, for if you understand that it's all part of the process of life, and the process of what our founding fathers understood completely, then there's no stepping away.
[02:06:00.509 --> 02:06:01.630]  There is no walking away.
[02:06:01.730 --> 02:06:06.054]  Grandpas and Grandmas listening right now, I know it sounds so tempting.
[02:06:06.174 --> 02:06:08.156]  It's so easy to say, I can relax.
[02:06:08.928 --> 02:06:10.410]  And in reality, though, think about it.
[02:06:10.450 --> 02:06:17.378]  What greater safety is there than to know that your sons and your daughters are safe and that they are secure in the knowledge of what they should know?
[02:06:17.958 --> 02:06:22.003]  Or that your grandchildren or your great-grandchildren should know the same knowledge?
[02:06:22.784 --> 02:06:29.191]  Should have the same processes that you had built into their being so that they, too, will rise up when the time comes?
[02:06:29.952 --> 02:06:31.334]  That's safety and security.
[02:06:31.554 --> 02:06:32.575]  Well, it's really simple.
[02:06:32.675 --> 02:06:39.623]  I mean, are we going to allow a group of globalists to re-engineer the species to try to kill 90% of the public at least?
[02:06:39.663 --> 02:06:43.328]  I mean, this is stated in United Nations Biological Diversity Assessments.
[02:06:43.348 --> 02:06:48.053]  These are raving, psychopathic killers and it is a grand illusion.
[02:06:49.855 --> 02:06:53.017]  People buy into little lies and they have to buy into all the other lies.
[02:06:53.077 --> 02:06:56.820]  It is a conscious choice and then they're totally turned over to it.
[02:06:57.181 --> 02:07:00.563]  The good news is some people aren't too far gone to be able to do that.
[02:07:00.803 --> 02:07:11.851]  I wanted to get my uncle's take on all the craziness that is happening right now with the youth brigades and the National Guard to be doing gun confiscation.
[02:07:12.272 --> 02:07:15.274]  I mean is this even amazing you how fast it's moving?
[02:07:16.255 --> 02:07:19.377]  Well it's all going by the book like the Johnny Cash song goes.
[02:07:19.824 --> 02:07:26.928]  There's a further answer to your prior question, and that is, most of your churchgoers today just want to be believers.
[02:07:27.408 --> 02:07:28.829]  They don't want to obey.
[02:07:29.589 --> 02:07:34.011]  And the Bible says that the demons believe and tremble.
[02:07:34.292 --> 02:07:35.252]  So that's not enough.
[02:07:35.392 --> 02:07:38.654]  We need to be disciples, not just Christians.
[02:07:39.214 --> 02:07:42.696]  And we need to obey what the Word says and be doers.
[02:07:43.196 --> 02:07:46.598]  The word Christian appears in the Bible about seven times.
[02:07:47.150 --> 02:07:50.132]  The word disciple appears about 230 times.
[02:07:50.533 --> 02:07:52.034]  What do you think he wants us to be?
[02:07:52.554 --> 02:07:56.217]  Mere Christians or obeying dedicated disciples?
[02:07:56.317 --> 02:07:57.438]  There's a big difference.
[02:07:57.958 --> 02:08:09.187]  And as far as this repeat of history goes, remember in Hitler's Germany, prior to the takeover in 33, Ernst Röhm was the leader of the SA.
[02:08:09.867 --> 02:08:13.270]  Hundreds of thousands of all kinds of weirdos.
[02:08:14.122 --> 02:08:17.784]  Launched out to go through the streets and beat everybody in the submission.
[02:08:18.504 --> 02:08:21.765]  Hitler used those worthless curves to get his job done.
[02:08:22.326 --> 02:08:26.388]  And then on the light of the long knives, he wiped them all out.
[02:08:26.468 --> 02:08:28.448]  From Ernst Röhm all the way down.
[02:08:28.969 --> 02:08:32.410]  And he brought in his 100% loyal SS.
[02:08:32.610 --> 02:08:34.911]  They were not loyal to anyone but him.
[02:08:34.971 --> 02:08:37.172]  Not to the nation, not to the army, not to anything.
[02:08:37.192 --> 02:08:40.914]  Well that's what this 100 million cannon fodder group is.
[02:08:41.074 --> 02:08:42.755]  They're the equivalent of the SA.
[02:08:43.311 --> 02:08:52.034]  Which will be used as stormtroopers to run through the streets, beat everybody into submission, and then when they are ready to get rid of them, they'll be gone.
[02:08:53.639 --> 02:09:06.949]  I just, it's so classic to be hiring felons and aggravated felons for the military and police and to be hiring youth brigades to spy on people and now in every major airport they're now putting the body scanners in.
[02:09:06.989 --> 02:09:14.755]  I've got the news articles but I've gotten emails from people where they go, you will go through it and we will scan your naked body and then they come up with tasers and get around you.
[02:09:14.775 --> 02:09:15.836]  If you won't, I mean this is
[02:09:16.576 --> 02:09:21.778]  This isn't, and now the Homeland Security's proposing making us wear shock bracelets when we get on planes?
[02:09:21.938 --> 02:09:22.478]  Everybody?
[02:09:22.938 --> 02:09:25.880]  I mean, Mark, this is getting even more ridiculous than I could imagine.
[02:09:26.020 --> 02:09:32.622]  Well, and the thing here, too, again, remember, I want to touch on this because I know we don't have much time, but real quick, people, we have to organize.
[02:09:33.462 --> 02:09:40.465]  And what we're seeing there is, are in the international zones, by the way, think about this, the airports are the international ports of entry.
[02:09:40.525 --> 02:09:42.866]  That's how they brought all this in is alien law.
[02:09:43.596 --> 02:09:44.797]  Separate from the United States.
[02:09:44.817 --> 02:09:53.562]  That's why they wanted to convert all of our airports from local airports into regional slash airports tied into international airports.
[02:09:53.602 --> 02:09:54.162]  That's right.
[02:09:54.643 --> 02:10:00.466]  That has brought in alien contract law, admiralty law, through the all the rest of the nonsense.
[02:10:01.086 --> 02:10:01.887]  Now real quick here.
[02:10:02.047 --> 02:10:03.228]  PBN P.O.
[02:10:03.288 --> 02:10:04.068]  Box 194, Dexter, Michigan, 48130.
[02:10:04.148 --> 02:10:04.308]  PBN
[02:10:09.403 --> 02:10:09.763]  P.O.
[02:10:09.803 --> 02:10:12.426]  Box 194, Dexter, Michigan, 48130.
[02:10:13.687 --> 02:10:17.230]  Send a self-addressed stamped envelope if you want more info.
[02:10:17.990 --> 02:10:24.836]  Real quick, Alex, PM 8-94, How to Start and Train a Militia Unit.
[02:10:25.537 --> 02:10:31.802]  This has been put together to help people speed the process up, make copies, generate them, drop them everywhere.
[02:10:32.383 --> 02:10:32.983]  It is PM 8-94.
[02:10:33.003 --> 02:10:33.764]  The cost is $5 per unit.
[02:10:36.519 --> 02:10:38.701]  Plus six stamps in postage.
[02:10:38.841 --> 02:10:39.942]  Any combination of stamps.
[02:10:39.982 --> 02:10:40.462]  I don't care.
[02:10:40.482 --> 02:10:41.403]  The stamps will be used.
[02:10:41.563 --> 02:10:43.224]  Old stamps, new stamps, whatever you got.
[02:10:43.644 --> 02:10:44.645]  Penny stamps are fine.
[02:10:45.386 --> 02:10:46.026]  PM 8-94.
[02:10:46.327 --> 02:10:50.109]  How to start and train a militia unit.
[02:10:50.910 --> 02:10:54.313]  Uh, if you're going to use a check or money order, make it out to Nancy Kornke.
[02:10:54.413 --> 02:10:56.754]  K-O-E-R-N-K-E.
[02:10:57.235 --> 02:10:58.836]  That's Nancy Kornke.
[02:10:58.936 --> 02:11:00.557]  K-O-E-R-N-K-E.
[02:11:01.078 --> 02:11:04.901]  The other manual that is one of several that are being generated is PM 10.
[02:11:05.808 --> 02:11:08.850]  Which is, of course, Militia Standard Operating Procedure.
[02:11:08.890 --> 02:11:14.273]  This allows you to create a standard procedure for the individual, the fireteam, and the squad.
[02:11:14.373 --> 02:11:24.439]  And this way it can be cellular, and in cells across the country, but have the basic command structure, and to have unified, upstanding rules.
[02:11:24.459 --> 02:11:25.780]  It can always come together.
[02:11:26.180 --> 02:11:31.963]  The building blocks of an army are the individual, the fireteam of 5 or 6 men, and the squad, which can be 10 or 12 men.
[02:11:33.105 --> 02:11:36.113]  If you understand those basic components, it makes no difference.
[02:11:36.133 --> 02:11:38.159]  You can bring them together in any combination.
[02:11:38.749 --> 02:11:42.673]  And they can work within their elements and then work as a larger formation.
[02:11:42.693 --> 02:11:43.994]  By the way, Mark, let me just say this now.
[02:11:44.335 --> 02:11:50.500]  Let's set you up right now for an hour and a half next week and just do militia, how to not be infiltrated, how to form.
[02:11:51.261 --> 02:11:51.862]  Look at your book.
[02:11:51.902 --> 02:11:53.243]  Let's do it right now like we did last week.
[02:11:53.403 --> 02:11:54.905]  What time do you want to come on next week?
[02:11:55.045 --> 02:11:56.146]  Oh, probably up to you.
[02:11:56.186 --> 02:11:56.867]  Whatever you need, Alex.
[02:11:56.887 --> 02:11:58.608]  It's up to you.
[02:11:58.668 --> 02:12:00.690]  Trey was working Sunday, so he just left.
[02:12:01.791 --> 02:12:02.732]  Let's shoot for...
[02:12:03.994 --> 02:12:07.177]  Next Wednesday at 12 noon.
[02:12:07.217 --> 02:12:08.318]  That way it's a different time.
[02:12:09.059 --> 02:12:11.301]  Next Wednesday at 12 noon.
[02:12:11.441 --> 02:12:11.961]  Is that good?
[02:12:12.161 --> 02:12:12.682]  That'd be fine.
[02:12:12.762 --> 02:12:14.644]  That's 12 noon central, 1 pm eastern.
[02:12:15.024 --> 02:12:15.905]  Okay, very good.
[02:12:16.065 --> 02:12:17.046]  1 pm eastern your time.
[02:12:17.446 --> 02:12:18.247]  Absolutely, Mark.
[02:12:18.327 --> 02:12:19.648]  And fire out your website again.
[02:12:20.169 --> 02:12:22.851]  And if you'd like to, you can also check out our videos at YouTube.
[02:12:22.871 --> 02:12:27.075]  These are training videos, but there's also to show you what's being done around the country, people.
[02:12:27.675 --> 02:12:30.338]  Go to Liberty Tree Radio.
[02:12:31.221 --> 02:12:54.981]  dot the number four dot four m g dot com again that's liberty tree radio dot four m g dot com or you can go to youtube and just punch in liberty tree radio to watch the video or mark corny and see america in peril and all your other films now now i i want to take a few fall for you guys leave uh... because i'm in the show about fifteen twenty minutes if that isn't too long for you guys uh... but but uh...
[02:12:55.521 --> 02:12:56.943]  I know my uncle woke me up.
[02:12:56.963 --> 02:13:03.511]  Well, I had already read some books and knew something about it, but before I ever found you, Mark, and others in the early 90s, I would say, I love Rush Limbaugh.
[02:13:03.551 --> 02:13:05.473]  And he'd say, oh, you need to learn about the New World Order.
[02:13:05.493 --> 02:13:07.736]  And then he'd explain it to me and I already knew quite a bit about it.
[02:13:07.776 --> 02:13:11.020]  I just didn't realize how big it was or how much in force it was.
[02:13:11.621 --> 02:13:15.265]  I've already read None Dare Call a Conspiracy when I was like 15 or 16, maybe even younger.
[02:13:15.885 --> 02:13:19.649]  And then I read Mein Kampf and other history books just to understand things.
[02:13:19.709 --> 02:13:25.074]  I read Gibbons' Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire, Scherer's Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.
[02:13:25.575 --> 02:13:30.700]  But it's just neat to have my uncle, who's a really knowledgeable guy, on with Mark Kornke.
[02:13:30.780 --> 02:13:32.502]  And I know he likes you too, Mark.
[02:13:32.522 --> 02:13:33.763]  Do you want to say hi to Mark?
[02:13:37.454 --> 02:13:42.677]  Yes, I've been a fan of Mark since I guess he was ever on shortwave, and I do have a request, Mark.
[02:13:43.057 --> 02:13:56.506]  When you come on Alex's show next week, if you feel comfortable, I'd like to hear you lay out some of how you went through your incarceration and didn't just come out the same man or a worse man, but came out a better man.
[02:13:56.666 --> 02:13:59.388]  I think we need to hear that if you're comfortable with that.
[02:13:59.528 --> 02:14:00.408]  I can do that, yes.
[02:14:01.189 --> 02:14:05.812]  I will say that part of what, first of all, not part, the foundation is this.
[02:14:06.576 --> 02:14:11.820]  Understand that we must have full strength, and we must follow the guiding light of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:12.360]  Period.
[02:14:13.401 --> 02:14:19.866]  If you do not have that as an anchor, then everything else becomes much more difficult, or in some cases, for some people, impossible.
[02:14:20.667 --> 02:14:35.918]  But because of that, if we understand that we are in a war, and this war will last the whole length of our lives, as long as we understand we're in that war, and we have that rod, that strength to stand with, then nothing, absolutely nothing, can defeat us.
[02:14:36.556 --> 02:14:41.158]  And our enemy, there is no doubt in my mind, people, our enemy knows this fully.
[02:14:41.419 --> 02:14:42.859]  Well, I want to be clear for everybody, too.
[02:14:43.139 --> 02:14:44.040]  They're not going away.
[02:14:44.540 --> 02:14:46.301]  Folks, I'm not trying to play it safe here.
[02:14:46.321 --> 02:14:47.662]  They're criminals.
[02:14:47.702 --> 02:14:48.242]  They're coming.
[02:14:48.602 --> 02:14:49.583]  There's nothing we can do.
[02:14:49.723 --> 02:14:50.383]  I'm committed.
[02:14:51.424 --> 02:14:54.325]  They're not just going to run some corruption like Argentina or something.
[02:14:54.886 --> 02:14:58.607]  They plan to kill tens of millions.
[02:14:58.647 --> 02:15:01.929]  They plan to overdo what they did in Russia, in Germany.
[02:15:02.009 --> 02:15:02.950]  They have shed it.
[02:15:03.650 --> 02:15:28.654]  You know, Alex, really quick on this, you know one thing I've been watching, you know that you can tell who your enemies are amongst the people when you're talking in a public place, because they'll turn away, they look down, they'll try to look away, and they're the people who try just to be a naysayer, but the problem is this, kind of like the old cowboys who used to tell you when they were there amongst the herd, when there was that dry crackling lightning in the sky, you could tell when the herd was thinking about stampeding,
[02:15:29.898 --> 02:15:30.819]  You know what I'm talking about?
[02:15:30.839 --> 02:15:40.764]  In other words, everybody knew, all of that group of livestock knew something was wrong and then something was, as they say, in the wind, in the air.
[02:15:41.564 --> 02:15:48.148]  There are a lot of people that even if they're trying to sit in denial right now, you look at their eyes, they don't laugh.
[02:15:48.308 --> 02:15:51.910]  They might turn away, they might look down, but they don't turn away and not listen.
[02:15:53.146 --> 02:15:59.851]  Because everybody knows that what we are talking about is true because they all in their subconscious have part of this formula.
[02:16:00.572 --> 02:16:02.393]  They have part of the math right now.
[02:16:02.513 --> 02:16:04.575]  They just aren't... The problem is this.
[02:16:05.075 --> 02:16:09.539]  To step forward and acknowledge is a big shelf to pull yourself up to.
[02:16:09.559 --> 02:16:12.081]  I don't consider it steps like a regular stairs.
[02:16:12.641 --> 02:16:20.727]  You have to physically reach up and pull yourself up to the next level and as a responsible adult, acknowledge what you're looking at.
[02:16:20.927 --> 02:16:22.609]  By the way, Mark, it's been confirmed
[02:16:24.065 --> 02:16:25.245]  Hundreds of thousands.
[02:16:25.446 --> 02:16:27.846]  The CDC has ordered these coffin boxes.
[02:16:27.886 --> 02:16:29.347]  They've got them at the Atlanta airport.
[02:16:29.807 --> 02:16:30.788]  And this is confirmed.
[02:16:31.388 --> 02:16:32.708]  Got the little newscast right here.
[02:16:32.728 --> 02:16:34.169]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:16:35.329 --> 02:16:36.370]  I mean, it's so obvious.
[02:16:36.410 --> 02:16:38.470]  Everybody's against the war, but they're going ahead with it.
[02:16:38.791 --> 02:16:40.571]  How do you expect to see this unfold, Mark?
[02:16:40.591 --> 02:16:41.752]  You think they're going to go ahead and hit Iran?
[02:16:41.812 --> 02:16:42.772]  And what do you think is going to happen?
[02:16:42.792 --> 02:16:47.554]  Well, I think Iran would be desperation, because as more and more things happen here, they're going to try to pull us away.
[02:16:47.594 --> 02:16:49.235]  But I don't think it's going to do them any good.
[02:16:49.475 --> 02:16:50.075]  I believe that
[02:16:50.990 --> 02:16:53.074]  They'll have to try for something inside the U.S.
[02:16:53.134 --> 02:16:54.376]  as a 1-2-3 punch.
[02:16:54.997 --> 02:16:57.963]  The problem is, they know that everybody is looking for them.
[02:16:58.516 --> 02:17:02.098]  You know, we're taking to spirit the whole idea, oh, we're under attack.
[02:17:02.118 --> 02:17:03.319]  Yeah, I believe we're under attack.
[02:17:03.379 --> 02:17:05.460]  I believe that it's by traitors inside the system.
[02:17:05.840 --> 02:17:06.981]  So we know where to focus.
[02:17:07.001 --> 02:17:08.102]  We know how to look for them.
[02:17:08.122 --> 02:17:09.082]  We know what to watch for.
[02:17:09.542 --> 02:17:12.064]  And many men in uniform out there know the same thing.
[02:17:12.584 --> 02:17:19.908]  There are a whole bunch of men who were there for 9-11 who saw how America was betrayed through lack of action.
[02:17:19.928 --> 02:17:20.689]  Well, I want to say to them,
[02:17:21.932 --> 02:17:30.158]  I mean, do you think you're going to be safe with a government that'll just kill 3,000 of us as a stunt, or kill 4,307 little kids radiating them in the 40s?
[02:17:30.438 --> 02:17:32.199]  I mean, they do this all the time.
[02:17:32.780 --> 02:17:37.964]  And the point is, now they're getting ready to really run a Soviet mass murder op on us, and there's no doubting it.
[02:17:37.984 --> 02:17:44.028]  I have all these big former White House people on saying it, and I mean, it isn't going to go away unless you stand up now.
[02:17:45.429 --> 02:17:46.330]  But I agree with you, Mark.
[02:17:46.350 --> 02:17:46.970]  They're shook up.
[02:17:47.010 --> 02:17:47.851]  Let me go back to my uncle.
[02:17:48.908 --> 02:17:53.130]  You're out there in the country, though, with a lot of, you know, hillbillies and folks around you.
[02:17:53.150 --> 02:17:56.031]  And the problem is, some areas they're awake, some areas they're not.
[02:17:56.712 --> 02:17:57.892]  They're not awake out there.
[02:17:58.592 --> 02:18:00.133]  And they don't know what's going on.
[02:18:01.113 --> 02:18:02.374]  And in some areas they do.
[02:18:02.474 --> 02:18:06.616]  But that's what's so sad, is that there's good men and women, they just don't know.
[02:18:06.656 --> 02:18:09.457]  That's why it's our job to get the word out to them any way we can.
[02:18:09.477 --> 02:18:13.119]  And they don't even know where the gas prices are coming from.
[02:18:15.060 --> 02:18:17.581]  Again, talking to my uncle, William Hammond, where do you see this going?
[02:18:18.618 --> 02:18:23.281]  Well, I always refer back to the Bible, and we are in the end times.
[02:18:23.341 --> 02:18:31.647]  That's why the true patriots and true Christians have a quickening in their spirit, that they really must act and all do something, be it ever so humble.
[02:18:32.267 --> 02:18:43.374]  And one thing that everybody can do is, like Alan Stang, one of the founders and grandfathers of the movement, always said at the end of his radio show, arm yourselves.
[02:18:45.296 --> 02:18:45.516]  Yes.
[02:18:46.755 --> 02:18:47.116]  I don't know.
[02:19:05.973 --> 02:19:07.774]  You want to vote and let them know what you're thinking?
[02:19:08.254 --> 02:19:13.678]  Take that pocket full of change you got that you saved up that's in your pocket, in the left pocket there, or in your little change purse.
[02:19:14.098 --> 02:19:19.462]  Take a dollar and go into the hardware store and buy a fifty-round box of twenty-two ammunition today to make a statement.
[02:19:19.722 --> 02:19:33.771]  Well, the deal is they're going to gut the country fully, and we've always told you to be financial with terror and wars, every angle, and they need to have a war so you'll rally around them while they fully gut the country, and they need a police state so they can get away with all their crimes.
[02:19:34.631 --> 02:19:37.632]  And that is a, as Mark always says, that is a rearguard action.
[02:19:37.652 --> 02:19:39.893]  Their stage terror is desperation.
[02:19:40.673 --> 02:19:42.514]  And they're going to be defeated.
[02:19:43.514 --> 02:19:43.754]  Alex?
[02:19:44.095 --> 02:19:44.375]  Yes, sir?
[02:19:44.415 --> 02:19:46.636]  Could I add one more thing about the rural areas?
[02:19:46.876 --> 02:19:47.156]  Yes.
[02:19:47.956 --> 02:19:55.879]  If history is any example, the Civil War in Bolshevik Russia took place from 1917 to 1919.
[02:19:56.779 --> 02:20:01.721]  And at that time, the white forces were defeated and the Bolsheviks were masters.
[02:20:01.821 --> 02:20:03.842]  However, Stalin took over
[02:20:04.494 --> 02:20:09.596]  And it took him from 1919 till 1922 to subdue the city.
[02:20:10.216 --> 02:20:19.299]  The countryside was pretty well on its own in terms of freedom between 1918 and 1922.
[02:20:19.919 --> 02:20:22.020]  So I think the same thing will repeat itself.
[02:20:22.060 --> 02:20:32.403]  There'll be such an effort, such a problem within the mass urban areas that the people in the urban areas, if they have half a brain cell, excuse me, the people in the rural areas,
[02:20:32.805 --> 02:20:41.152]  If they have half a brain cell, we'll be able to see what's happening, know what's coming their way, and get ready, because there will be no denial by then.
[02:20:41.672 --> 02:20:43.814]  And we gotta look at the Alexander Schultz and Itzik quote.
[02:20:43.894 --> 02:20:47.997]  If they're trying to take you to camps, coming to get you, what's the quote, Mark?
[02:20:48.097 --> 02:21:01.868]  Oh, how we burned later in the camps, wishing... Knowing full well that we had, realizing that we had had nothing to lose, and if we had waited in the shadows when the mass arrest had begun, with sharp objects and cudgels, the wretched machine, for lack of operatives, would have ground to a halt.
[02:21:03.274 --> 02:21:05.615]  But we don't have to wait with sharp objects and cudgels.
[02:21:06.015 --> 02:21:11.998]  We are an arm of population with an army bigger than any other on the planet, and we're on our supply base.
[02:21:12.478 --> 02:21:18.081]  Which, as any commander knows, when you're on your supply base, just like Chesty Puller said, hey, we're surrounded.
[02:21:18.221 --> 02:21:18.541]  Good.
[02:21:18.601 --> 02:21:19.941]  We can attack in all directions.
[02:21:19.981 --> 02:21:20.542]  And you know what?
[02:21:20.602 --> 02:21:23.363]  By the way, every bullet counts, because it's going to hit a bad guy.
[02:21:25.270 --> 02:21:28.552]  Well, I just want to tell all the goons out there, I think it's all funny and cute.
[02:21:29.032 --> 02:21:30.633]  You know, having B.A.T.F.
[02:21:30.653 --> 02:21:36.256]  harass me one time, seeing the evil people, when you really get around them, they are like piles of crap.
[02:21:36.296 --> 02:21:44.440]  I mean, they're weak, sorry little soft guys, always trying to act tough with shaved heads and goatees, and they laugh at you, and they think it's all funny.
[02:21:45.561 --> 02:21:49.163]  Yeah, they're going to find out how funny it is when their own masters are slit in their throats.
[02:21:49.184 --> 02:21:50.464]  I mean, they're going to really find out.
[02:21:50.785 --> 02:21:53.226]  They've had it soft and easy and they think they're tough guys.
[02:21:53.406 --> 02:21:55.288]  They're going to find out they're not so tough, aren't they?
[02:21:55.528 --> 02:21:56.228]  Well, interesting.
[02:21:56.308 --> 02:22:08.736]  Guys, in every situation where mass graves were found, every 3,000 to 6,000 bodies, there were uniformed soldiers or interior police that were shot and buried right there.
[02:22:08.817 --> 02:22:09.357]  Who were they?
[02:22:10.051 --> 02:22:17.234]  They were the execution squad that were told they were the pet puppies and they wouldn't be touched as long as they murdered 20, 30, or 100,000 people.
[02:22:17.774 --> 02:22:29.838]  But at a given point, to make sure nobody found out, or less information came out, the next execution squad came in and their first job was to kill the old execution squad.
[02:22:30.939 --> 02:22:36.581]  It's the same thing, even remember, now the Czar's body, remember they kept this kind of quiet, but remember they've just done a DNA check
[02:22:37.031 --> 02:22:40.052]  And they found the place where the Czar and his family's body were buried?
[02:22:40.212 --> 02:22:40.452]  Yeah.
[02:22:40.772 --> 02:22:44.133]  Remember that three execution squads were involved.
[02:22:45.013 --> 02:22:46.333]  One came in and killed them.
[02:22:46.933 --> 02:22:50.854]  Another group was told that they were counter-revolutionaries, and they came in and killed them.
[02:22:51.375 --> 02:22:58.756]  And yet another one came in and killed the other group, and still they couldn't destroy completely where those bodies were buried.
[02:22:58.796 --> 02:23:02.137]  It had been a rumor, but it was an accurate rumor like everything else.
[02:23:02.577 --> 02:23:05.398]  There was accuracy because the information did get out.
[02:23:06.201 --> 02:23:09.882]  It's the same is true with regard to the mass executions in Russia.
[02:23:09.962 --> 02:23:18.525]  You know, our government and the UN did everything they could to bury, pardon the pun, any information on what happened to the Poles, the Czechs, and whatever.
[02:23:18.965 --> 02:23:31.729]  And after all these years, the Poles are still disgusted because Kaetin, the Kosigory, known as Goat's Hill in the Smolensk Peninsula, was dug up and virtually tens and tens of thousands of Boy Scouts
[02:23:32.219 --> 02:23:33.240]  We're good to go.
[02:23:48.240 --> 02:23:52.682]  Wanted that to happen there, and now they would like to plug it in here in the United States.
[02:23:52.702 --> 02:23:59.924]  Well, when you meet the scumbag professors and others, they're always chicken-necked, cowardly weaklings, and they just walk around hissing about death.
[02:23:59.984 --> 02:24:01.525]  I mean, they just love death.
[02:24:01.585 --> 02:24:05.447]  They are maggot slime.
[02:24:05.467 --> 02:24:06.647]  I mean, I don't know how to describe them.
[02:24:06.687 --> 02:24:12.789]  They are just putrid, unhappy, ugly, grimy, slimebag demons.
[02:24:15.626 --> 02:24:19.827]  I mean, I know my uncle's seen a lot, a Vietnam veteran and been all over the world, seen quite a bit.
[02:24:19.867 --> 02:24:21.647]  You know what I'm talking about, about evil people?
[02:24:22.148 --> 02:24:25.969]  Why do they hate beauty and love death so much, and why do they love their master so much?
[02:24:26.489 --> 02:24:28.489]  Well, now you're getting back into theology, Alex.
[02:24:28.589 --> 02:24:34.291]  It's a question of the righteous line and the wicked line, and that goes back to the Garden of Eden.
[02:24:34.311 --> 02:24:38.952]  And we probably can't shake that out here, but there is a wicked evil line.
[02:24:39.392 --> 02:24:43.793]  They will never believe, and so they logically serve their own master, Satan.
[02:24:44.392 --> 02:24:50.516]  And there are those chosen by our Heavenly Father to believe, and we naturally gravitate to His love and His truth.
[02:24:52.096 --> 02:24:52.537]  Exactly.
[02:24:52.557 --> 02:24:56.659]  Well, and you do see certain families that are just evil for scores of generations.
[02:24:57.119 --> 02:24:58.580]  And then you see other families that aren't.
[02:24:59.741 --> 02:25:00.241]  Exactly.
[02:25:00.261 --> 02:25:12.628]  There's no way through the millennia that this evil conspiracy could have survived and flourished and gotten to the point it is at right now if it were not aided and abetted by supernatural forces from the dark side.
[02:25:12.648 --> 02:25:14.129]  It's beyond human intelligence.
[02:25:14.736 --> 02:25:16.457]  And their master always destroys them.
[02:25:16.517 --> 02:25:17.598]  But they love it.
[02:25:17.618 --> 02:25:18.238]  They say, oh, destroy me!
[02:25:18.258 --> 02:25:18.538]  Oh, yes!
[02:25:27.066 --> 02:25:27.627]  It's incredible.
[02:25:27.987 --> 02:25:33.831]  Okay, well, keep up all the great work you're doing, and I love you, and say hi to everybody down there for me.
[02:25:34.092 --> 02:25:34.612]  Love you.
[02:25:35.312 --> 02:25:36.173]  I should say up there.
[02:25:36.213 --> 02:25:38.055]  He's actually up and over on the state.
[02:25:38.795 --> 02:25:41.757]  Mark, I don't want to keep you all day, but I do want to take a little bit of gamut here of calls.
[02:25:41.777 --> 02:25:42.698]  I want to talk to you, okay?
[02:25:42.978 --> 02:25:43.379]  Go right ahead.
[02:25:43.939 --> 02:25:45.220]  Okay, now I'm going to take ten of these.
[02:25:45.340 --> 02:25:46.521]  We literally have unlimited.
[02:25:46.861 --> 02:25:48.422]  I'm just going to go to ten of them, and that's it.
[02:25:48.603 --> 02:25:52.526]  Alex, Steve, Bart, Chad, Bandit, and maybe one other.
[02:25:53.286 --> 02:25:55.328]  Steve in Pennsylvania, you're on the air with Mark Kornke.
[02:25:56.269 --> 02:25:57.169]  Yeah, hi Mark and Alex.
[02:25:57.349 --> 02:25:58.049]  I love the show.
[02:25:58.170 --> 02:26:13.853]  I agree wholeheartedly, concur with just about every aspect of what you're talking about there, and I wanted to come in here about the spin that the Christians have put on this doctrine of the rapture and the preacher of rapture, and I just run into this all the time.
[02:26:14.114 --> 02:26:19.755]  Church people are so deceived, and it's like their brains and their minds are soaked
[02:26:20.552 --> 02:26:22.013]  In this left-right paradigm.
[02:26:22.033 --> 02:26:25.416]  And by the way, they don't just come in and say, I'm going to be raptured.
[02:26:25.456 --> 02:26:27.497]  They say, hey, I don't want to hear about it.
[02:26:27.938 --> 02:26:28.838]  I'm going to be raptured.
[02:26:28.858 --> 02:26:29.098]  Exactly.
[02:26:29.198 --> 02:26:30.259]  It's a cop-out.
[02:26:30.760 --> 02:26:40.427]  I can't even get on a phone conversation with somebody that I know well, and they're just automatically putting me in this camp and saying, I'm just this and that and I'm a liberal.
[02:26:40.447 --> 02:26:41.688]  I'm just trying to bash George Bush.
[02:26:42.330 --> 02:26:45.712]  Never said a word about that, but they're just totally preconditioned and programmed.
[02:26:45.732 --> 02:26:51.055]  It's just almost like... Yeah, you say, let's fight evil, let's fight evil, and they say, you're not with Lord Bush.
[02:26:51.796 --> 02:26:52.176]  Exactly.
[02:26:52.216 --> 02:26:54.318]  I'm trying to, like, let's talk about what's true here.
[02:26:54.358 --> 02:26:55.238]  Let's look at the facts.
[02:26:55.278 --> 02:26:56.119]  Let's look at the history.
[02:26:56.179 --> 02:26:57.019]  Let's look at the stuff.
[02:26:57.079 --> 02:27:02.483]  And, you know, the thing with the... I used to be a believer in this preacher of rapture, and I woke up out of that.
[02:27:02.783 --> 02:27:04.624]  And one of the things that they think that, you know,
[02:27:05.037 --> 02:27:15.665]  Well, when all the Christians get raptured, you know, then that itself is going to cause an awakening, and you can have all these other Christians that are going to have to go through and get their heads chopped off.
[02:27:15.845 --> 02:27:20.428]  Yeah, it's kind of like, oh, we're the good ones, because we were out of here.
[02:27:20.588 --> 02:27:33.958]  Yeah, it's like, we're going to get flung out of here, but everybody that's left behind isn't going to have to, and if they become a Christian, then well... But if you look at history, and you look at the Old and New Testament, it's all about being persecuted, because you won't submit.
[02:27:35.259 --> 02:27:36.160]  It's just ridiculous.
[02:27:36.480 --> 02:27:45.565]  You know, here's the thing about the rapture, and you can confer with this with your uncle, you know, the rapture is only going to happen to those people that survive to the end.
[02:27:48.166 --> 02:27:48.767]  Absolutely.
[02:27:48.807 --> 02:27:52.409]  But it's an issue that needs to be addressed, and again, you have to ask basic questions.
[02:27:52.429 --> 02:27:56.051]  I always, like I said, I'm not joking.
[02:27:56.071 --> 02:28:00.173]  Hold on a second.
[02:28:03.464 --> 02:28:04.786]  Mark's got people coming in talking to him.
[02:28:18.024 --> 02:28:21.487]  You walk around in your sackcloth in the lilies of the field syndrome.
[02:28:21.607 --> 02:28:22.308]  We'll feed you.
[02:28:22.568 --> 02:28:25.371]  You can walk and talk with the people until you disappear.
[02:28:25.411 --> 02:28:27.893]  We'll scoop up the sacks and we'll use them for flour later.
[02:28:27.933 --> 02:28:28.574]  How's that sound?
[02:28:28.694 --> 02:28:29.155]  Absolutely.
[02:28:29.195 --> 02:28:30.156]  Let's take another call.
[02:28:30.216 --> 02:28:30.516]  Thank you.
[02:28:30.536 --> 02:28:31.937]  I've got to jump service and get to everybody.
[02:28:32.017 --> 02:28:32.378]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:28:32.398 --> 02:28:32.998]  Go right ahead, please.
[02:28:33.319 --> 02:28:34.640]  Mark, you've got time to take some more calls, right?
[02:28:34.680 --> 02:28:35.080]  Go right ahead.
[02:28:35.120 --> 02:28:36.301]  Yeah, we've got a little more time.
[02:28:36.522 --> 02:28:37.222]  Alex in New York.
[02:28:37.242 --> 02:28:37.943]  We've got to hurry here.
[02:28:37.963 --> 02:28:38.303]  Go ahead.
[02:28:39.024 --> 02:28:39.164]  Hi.
[02:28:39.184 --> 02:28:39.705]  How are you doing?
[02:28:39.925 --> 02:28:40.105]  Good.
[02:28:40.145 --> 02:28:42.187]  Can you hear me?
[02:28:42.507 --> 02:28:42.968]  All right.
[02:28:44.063 --> 02:28:45.083]  A couple questions about this.
[02:28:45.163 --> 02:29:03.186]  Correct me if I'm wrong, but were not most of our Founding Fathers deist in that they still believed in God, but they, I'd say they weren't sure about many... Some of them were, and you look at about 30% or so, some of the really prominent ones, like Jefferson and Franklin.
[02:29:03.486 --> 02:29:04.507]  Well, let's back up here, guys.
[02:29:04.547 --> 02:29:04.927]  Now, wait a minute.
[02:29:04.947 --> 02:29:06.347]  First of all, I have a problem with this.
[02:29:06.487 --> 02:29:07.087]  I'm an historian.
[02:29:07.347 --> 02:29:10.508]  I'm sitting around probably close to 40,000 books right here, okay?
[02:29:11.228 --> 02:29:12.548]  When was your information printed?
[02:29:13.803 --> 02:29:15.124]  Was it printed in 1775?
[02:29:16.105 --> 02:29:17.826]  Was it printed in 1730?
[02:29:17.966 --> 02:29:20.828]  Was it printed in... Well, Mark, I'm agreeing with you!
[02:29:20.868 --> 02:29:24.230]  No, my point is, guys, the reason I'm bringing this up is, my biggest problem is this.
[02:29:24.390 --> 02:29:26.852]  Our database has been corrupted to begin with.
[02:29:27.913 --> 02:29:29.013]  And this is true of everything.
[02:29:29.073 --> 02:29:33.136]  Look at how many things... Let's take the best example of this, if you want to ask that question.
[02:29:33.777 --> 02:29:34.657]  Does Ron Paul exist?
[02:29:37.717 --> 02:29:38.997]  Not according to the mainstream media.
[02:29:39.017 --> 02:29:39.518]  There you go.
[02:29:39.598 --> 02:29:40.218]  Thank you very much.
[02:29:40.258 --> 02:29:45.680]  You've lived through an experience right now, which I've used constantly with my students, and I add to everybody who's listening.
[02:29:45.820 --> 02:29:47.120]  Ron Paul exists, doesn't he?
[02:29:47.620 --> 02:29:52.662]  But if you were to tell somebody, Ron Paul's running for president, Ron Paul ran for president, really prove it to me!
[02:29:53.322 --> 02:29:55.603]  Well, that's like the North American Union set up.
[02:29:55.783 --> 02:29:56.903]  They say it doesn't exist.
[02:29:56.943 --> 02:30:00.724]  I'm just saying that when we talk about the idea that we're a Muslim deist, well, my problem is this.
[02:30:00.804 --> 02:30:02.745]  The writings that I see from the 1780s, the 1780s, the 1790s,
[02:30:05.905 --> 02:30:13.068]  And I can pull books off here that are reproductions or some are original, just the reverse is reinforced by their own writings.
[02:30:14.048 --> 02:30:22.912]  So my problem is, remember, that when there's been something repeated over and over again in the last 30 years, because I watched this myself... No, Mark, I agree with you, but it's true that some of them were.
[02:30:22.992 --> 02:30:25.493]  Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin.
[02:30:25.513 --> 02:30:26.553]  But that's my point.
[02:30:26.593 --> 02:30:27.354]  Go ahead, please.
[02:30:27.974 --> 02:30:32.816]  Okay, but I mean, look, let's also look at a couple other facts about it.
[02:30:33.656 --> 02:30:35.077]  You've said on several occasions that
[02:30:35.956 --> 02:30:38.278]  Most of our founding fathers were porch masons.
[02:30:38.358 --> 02:30:39.860]  I don't think that's true.
[02:30:39.900 --> 02:30:48.589]  I think actually the reason that we were given a secular form of government in which we have the separation of church and state is because most of them were
[02:30:49.173 --> 02:30:55.478]  They're Masons or Rosicrucians and were opposed to the idea of the union of the church and state like they had in Europe.
[02:30:55.498 --> 02:30:55.998]  Do you know what I mean?
[02:30:56.339 --> 02:30:58.761]  No, that's not accurate either.
[02:30:58.781 --> 02:31:05.866]  It was led by Christians who didn't like what England was doing and trying to make them have one religion.
[02:31:05.966 --> 02:31:07.768]  Well, let's tie this in.
[02:31:07.808 --> 02:31:11.431]  That comes from a series of videos and tapes that have been done most recently.
[02:31:11.531 --> 02:31:12.812]  I've seen them too.
[02:31:12.852 --> 02:31:18.096]  In fact, I think it was not loose change, but the other one where at the end it talks about we have to be in the form, fuzzy, global.
[02:31:18.496 --> 02:31:27.621]  Globalness, which gets us over into India again, with Far Eastern mysticism being plugged into a situation that had nothing to do with our Founding Fathers and how they operated.
[02:31:27.841 --> 02:31:29.222]  Now, here's the thing.
[02:31:29.322 --> 02:31:31.704]  There were Rosicrucians here, no doubt about that.
[02:31:32.244 --> 02:31:34.345]  There were Deists here, no doubt about that.
[02:31:34.825 --> 02:31:39.828]  My argument has been, from the very beginning, when discussing the whole concept, is I talked about hourglasses.
[02:31:39.988 --> 02:31:40.629]  Let's think about it.
[02:31:41.529 --> 02:31:42.790]  Turn the hourglass on its side.
[02:31:43.447 --> 02:31:53.754]  There are points in history where people, even though we have about a 5% variance in what we believe in, have all realized that the common threat is what we have to come together for.
[02:31:54.434 --> 02:32:02.379]  Now, even Alexander Hamilton, a man who was a war hero, and now he's a war hero in his own right because he fought tenaciously in the American Revolution, was wounded.
[02:32:02.900 --> 02:32:03.860]  There's no doubt about it.
[02:32:04.541 --> 02:32:10.464]  Yet this man, at the end of the Revolution, after the Articles of Confederation, and even as they were trying to create the
[02:32:12.742 --> 02:32:18.707]  Constitution of the Republic openly talked about handing us back over to the Crown.
[02:32:18.907 --> 02:32:21.289]  Or making George Washington a king and a central bank.
[02:32:21.610 --> 02:32:25.733]  So the big thing is, there's actually an accounting of this at the Constitutional Convention.
[02:32:25.753 --> 02:32:28.456]  Yeah, let's be clear, there were different blocks and different groups.
[02:32:28.756 --> 02:32:37.964]  But for the right, for the moment, this is the thing, that even though they had diverse ideas in certain, or in certain point, at certain point, in a certain point in time, and they changed.
[02:32:38.164 --> 02:32:38.845]  Men change.
[02:32:39.381 --> 02:32:44.863]  At that given point, from 1775 to 1783, they were together.
[02:32:45.003 --> 02:32:49.784]  And afterwards, I personally think that Byrd did us a favor when he shot Hamilton.
[02:32:50.344 --> 02:32:55.086]  The whole story of that is totally different from what they've tried to repaint on the New York Channel.
[02:32:55.346 --> 02:32:57.586]  Sir, you say, just finish up what you're saying.
[02:32:57.626 --> 02:32:58.187]  Forgive me, I'm sorry.
[02:32:58.207 --> 02:32:58.507]  No, it's fine.
[02:32:58.527 --> 02:32:59.747]  We've just got to get through the last few calls.
[02:33:00.667 --> 02:33:01.527]  Anything else, Alex?
[02:33:02.108 --> 02:33:06.529]  Yeah, sort of the conclusion I've come to is that the reason
[02:33:07.331 --> 02:33:21.185]  Sure, of course there's a diversity of opinions among the Founding Fathers, and obviously Byrd did us a favor when he was doing away with a Federalist like Hamilton, but what I've come to find in my own looking at this is that most of the Founding Fathers who were liberty-oriented
[02:33:21.696 --> 02:33:30.199]  were liberty-oriented because they were Masons and Rosicrucians, even though now, obviously, those groups are allied with a very different type of agenda.
[02:33:30.219 --> 02:33:31.079]  Well, let me break this down.
[02:33:31.119 --> 02:33:40.002]  The evil groups that were infiltrating and took over the Masons then needed to have the good guys under their control so they would recruit them into it as a control arm.
[02:33:40.022 --> 02:33:41.022]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:33:41.062 --> 02:33:41.842]  I've got to go here.
[02:33:42.642 --> 02:33:44.943]  Let's talk to Bart in Houston.
[02:33:45.903 --> 02:33:46.884]  You're on the air.
[02:33:46.964 --> 02:33:47.544]  Go ahead, Bart.
[02:33:48.069 --> 02:33:54.432]  Well, guys, you know, I want to say first off that this information is critical, and I really think y'all are hitting on all cylinders.
[02:33:54.532 --> 02:34:03.396]  You know, we have to approach this, at least in our own interior confrontation with this entire reality that it is a spiritual situation.
[02:34:03.556 --> 02:34:08.758]  And, you know, what really upsets me is just all of the semantics that people use, you know?
[02:34:12.836 --> 02:34:22.743]  You always use this quote, Alex, and I've used it as the bedrock of my understanding of dealing with the public, dealing with politicians, dealing with everything, is that by their works you shall know them.
[02:34:23.223 --> 02:34:29.207]  If they're locked in a churchianity and they're not practicing what they're supposedly learning, then they are a dead tree.
[02:34:29.687 --> 02:34:41.695]  They are not actually bearing any fruit of what it is that they are taking in, and that is one of the key things that you can recognize in people that are either, you know, I don't care if they don't even know about the New World Order,
[02:34:42.307 --> 02:34:59.923]  If they're out in the street and they are utilizing that dynamic human spirit, that spark of God's creation within us, which is the ability to create in this reality, the ability to use our minds to reach into this reality... In our precious limited time, like Mark always talks about, you don't get any more of that time.
[02:35:00.023 --> 02:35:00.423]  That's right.
[02:35:00.604 --> 02:35:02.525]  God gives us only one pocketful here.
[02:35:02.545 --> 02:35:04.747]  It's like, you know, you guys all remember this.
[02:35:05.188 --> 02:35:08.691]  You can't reach into your pocket and hand a handful of seconds over to another man.
[02:35:10.758 --> 02:35:11.619]  That's the whole thing.
[02:35:11.720 --> 02:35:13.141]  We have to burn.
[02:35:13.461 --> 02:35:14.462]  We have to burn.
[02:35:14.482 --> 02:35:15.984]  And I'm talking about myself.
[02:35:16.144 --> 02:35:18.847]  I'm talking about everyone that's trying to do something right now.
[02:35:19.288 --> 02:35:21.410]  We have to be the bonfires in the night.
[02:35:21.829 --> 02:35:29.031]  And that's why it's so important for the information that y'all are getting out to be gotten out, but then to be applied in the real world.
[02:35:29.111 --> 02:35:29.751]  No, I agree.
[02:35:29.891 --> 02:35:31.012]  And that's up to you guys.
[02:35:31.032 --> 02:35:33.072]  People say, Alex do this or Mark do that.
[02:35:33.112 --> 02:35:34.513]  We're working as hard as we can.
[02:35:35.213 --> 02:35:36.553]  We're putting out the info.
[02:35:36.573 --> 02:35:37.613]  We're listening to your info.
[02:35:37.893 --> 02:35:38.834]  It's all of us together.
[02:35:38.894 --> 02:35:40.154]  Many hands make light work.
[02:35:40.754 --> 02:35:42.835]  And we have to all commit and realize
[02:35:43.655 --> 02:35:45.636]  I mean, we're living in the most incredible time ever.
[02:35:45.676 --> 02:35:48.238]  We ought to thank God we're living in this time to be tested.
[02:35:48.498 --> 02:35:49.438]  And I appreciate your call.
[02:35:49.478 --> 02:35:50.879]  Call me back later, Bart.
[02:35:50.899 --> 02:35:51.399]  Great points.
[02:35:51.759 --> 02:35:53.200]  Mark, your comments on what he was saying.
[02:35:53.320 --> 02:35:58.903]  Well, again, and also this ties in with our last caller, too, about even, for instance, many of the founders being Masons.
[02:35:59.023 --> 02:36:10.830]  Okay, Washington said the Masonry of the continent and the Mason of New America were two totally different institutions, under the argument that perhaps there was, again, another agenda afoot.
[02:36:11.351 --> 02:36:17.253]  They all understood, and they acknowledged the overall authority of God.
[02:36:17.953 --> 02:36:31.016]  The fact that if we don't answer to a higher being, if we don't answer to God, and we don't, just as was said here by this caller, apply what it is that we know, then somebody, that vacuum, will be filled by something.
[02:36:31.056 --> 02:36:38.998]  And we know that it's, you know, the good and evil pull back and forth, that if we don't step in there and do what is righteous, and do what needs to be done,
[02:36:39.622 --> 02:36:47.489]  That there is a power vacuum that will be filled with something totally different from what one... Evil succeeds because good people do nothing.
[02:36:47.529 --> 02:36:47.950]  That's right.
[02:36:48.070 --> 02:36:49.111]  Failure to perform.
[02:36:49.351 --> 02:36:50.892]  And that's what we're talking about.
[02:36:50.912 --> 02:36:51.993]  And we must be well-rounded.
[02:36:52.374 --> 02:36:53.535]  We must be knowledgeable.
[02:36:54.309 --> 02:36:59.030]  In the processes of the ethereal, the mind is a powerful tool, the spirit greater still.
[02:36:59.210 --> 02:37:01.911]  Yeah, don't waste your time watching TV and screwing around, folks.
[02:37:01.971 --> 02:37:02.611]  Life is short.
[02:37:02.991 --> 02:37:09.513]  And we're also in the physical world, which is the other half of this, which is why, one, all of you, the militia is the property of we, the people.
[02:37:09.573 --> 02:37:11.153]  It is not the property of the state.
[02:37:11.553 --> 02:37:14.254]  We did not vote to go into the American Revolution, people.
[02:37:14.414 --> 02:37:15.874]  Tell me where there was a vote cast.
[02:37:15.894 --> 02:37:16.875]  There was one vote cast.
[02:37:16.895 --> 02:37:22.596]  A one-ounce mini-ball went downrange, and a whole bunch of votes went back and forth over the next few seconds at Lexington.
[02:37:23.192 --> 02:37:24.694]  And it was opposed and a four.
[02:37:24.814 --> 02:37:25.695]  Opposed and four.
[02:37:26.115 --> 02:37:26.595]  You know what?
[02:37:26.876 --> 02:37:28.037]  It started the revolution.
[02:37:28.177 --> 02:37:29.999]  The militia was the obligated force.
[02:37:30.339 --> 02:37:33.222]  They were the men standing there at the moment who saw the need.
[02:37:33.722 --> 02:37:36.745]  All of you out there must be part of the militia.
[02:37:37.085 --> 02:37:40.188]  As part of being a balanced man in living society.
[02:37:40.208 --> 02:37:42.090]  Gotta take a few final calls and let you go, Mark.
[02:37:42.650 --> 02:37:43.772]  Let's go to Mark in Michigan.
[02:37:43.792 --> 02:37:44.352]  Another Mark.
[02:37:44.552 --> 02:37:45.073]  Go ahead, Mark.
[02:37:45.836 --> 02:37:48.837]  Yeah, hey Alex, Mark, good to talk with you guys.
[02:37:49.358 --> 02:37:53.800]  You know, yeah, I'm seeing the church, it seems the church is just falling asleep, they are.
[02:37:54.080 --> 02:37:55.561]  More than asleep, they're the problem.
[02:37:56.301 --> 02:38:03.985]  Yeah, yeah, and you know, I just wanted to bring up one thing about 1 Thessalonians 4, 17, about meeting the Lord in the air.
[02:38:04.005 --> 02:38:13.449]  And I did study, you know, with the Greek, and that word, to meet, actually means to greet, you know, at the dignitary.
[02:38:14.232 --> 02:38:25.056]  So when the Lord does come back, when he does return, it'll be just as a meeting at the dignitary comes on to a tarmac of an airport.
[02:38:26.377 --> 02:38:29.398]  So that kind of blows the pre-rapture right out of the water.
[02:38:29.418 --> 02:38:32.679]  Well, the reason I bring it up is this is not even a religious show.
[02:38:32.779 --> 02:38:36.741]  I mean, I'm a Christian, but I'm letting people know I'm sick of the copping out.
[02:38:36.761 --> 02:38:38.362]  I mean, I'm really getting tired of it.
[02:38:38.662 --> 02:38:39.182]  Absolutely.
[02:38:40.102 --> 02:38:43.804]  You know, because they claim they're good, but they're not fighting dying poor child kidnapping rings.
[02:38:44.602 --> 02:38:46.023]  You know, I don't want to slap him upside the head.
[02:38:46.063 --> 02:38:47.263]  Anything else, Mark?
[02:38:47.423 --> 02:38:48.503]  That's it, Alex.
[02:38:48.603 --> 02:38:48.984]  Thank you.
[02:38:49.384 --> 02:38:49.684]  Thank you.
[02:38:49.704 --> 02:38:54.626]  Real fast, Chad in Michigan, you're on the air with Mark Quaranty, and then Bandit and Greg, and that's it.
[02:38:55.526 --> 02:38:59.067]  Yes, thank you, Alex, for taking my call, and thank you, Mark, for being a guest today.
[02:38:59.107 --> 02:39:00.128]  It's been an excellent show.
[02:39:00.828 --> 02:39:11.552]  I was, back in February, was in Washington, D.C., happened to be at a hotel where there was a conference of police chiefs from around the nation, and grabbed one of their publications.
[02:39:12.758 --> 02:39:21.304]  For whatever reason, just out of interest and curiosity, but I'm listening to you today talk about a possible false flag attack in Chicago.
[02:39:21.324 --> 02:39:23.105]  It jarred my memory.
[02:39:23.145 --> 02:39:34.293]  I pulled up this magazine, and starting on page 48, there's a five-page spread showing how they're going to nuke Chicago and what the effects would be from the blast radius going out from there.
[02:39:35.503 --> 02:39:37.924]  Just very powerful information.
[02:39:37.944 --> 02:39:45.366]  Yeah, they like to advertise, and they have a New Orleans as a drill, they then have a Chicago as a drill, then they carry out the attack where they say they would.
[02:39:45.666 --> 02:39:51.727]  It's kind of like, it's like Gary Hart's come right out and said, yeah, our government stages terror attacks, and he basically admits they did 9-11.
[02:39:52.027 --> 02:39:54.148]  It's like a laughing at you.
[02:39:54.508 --> 02:39:56.148]  We went and said, does the government stage attacks?
[02:39:56.308 --> 02:39:58.149]  And they said, yeah, sure do.
[02:40:00.964 --> 02:40:02.104]  You know, that's another thing.
[02:40:03.205 --> 02:40:03.565]  Why?
[02:40:03.945 --> 02:40:08.867]  Again, for those of us they know are awake, they kind of take the mask off and go, yeah, you bet we murder you.
[02:40:09.167 --> 02:40:10.588]  There's nothing that you're going to do.
[02:40:10.808 --> 02:40:11.468]  You're slaves.
[02:40:11.508 --> 02:40:12.188]  I'll never wake up.
[02:40:12.208 --> 02:40:13.469]  And they go, oh, back to the public.
[02:40:13.649 --> 02:40:14.689]  Hello, babies.
[02:40:15.349 --> 02:40:15.789]  Shut up.
[02:40:15.809 --> 02:40:17.010]  You're going to get you patriots.
[02:40:18.892 --> 02:40:26.440]  That's exactly how they're operating right now, too.
[02:40:26.501 --> 02:40:31.246]  In fact, if you look at it, they'll even claim in the same breath that they didn't say what they said only a moment earlier.
[02:40:32.227 --> 02:40:34.949]  Wait a minute, have you seen Truth Rising?
[02:40:35.349 --> 02:40:43.333]  Where we say, Gary Hart, you said in a letter to Iran that the government will stage terror attacks as a pretext to start war and that they better do what we say.
[02:40:43.694 --> 02:40:44.294]  Did you say that?
[02:40:44.314 --> 02:40:45.875]  And he goes, no, I did not say that.
[02:40:46.155 --> 02:40:49.037]  What I said is our government may stage terror attacks to start a war.
[02:40:51.681 --> 02:40:52.542]  But I mean, what is that?
[02:40:53.804 --> 02:40:54.805]  Why do they do that, do you think?
[02:40:54.925 --> 02:41:06.561]  Well, the negative is supposed to be implanted in the subconscious, and the idea is that through routine reinforcement through television, the subconscious will register the negative, but not just listen to the data that's being processed through the stream.
[02:41:06.681 --> 02:41:09.543]  And I've discovered the general public is in a mesmerized state.
[02:41:09.563 --> 02:41:13.927]  And I've seen studies of 30, 40 years ago, you only had 25% of people suggestible.
[02:41:14.227 --> 02:41:14.668]  Now it's like 65.
[02:41:15.688 --> 02:41:18.831]  And I've talked to people on the street, and I've tested it out.
[02:41:19.091 --> 02:41:23.175]  You can almost boss them around and be very calm, because they are asleep.
[02:41:23.275 --> 02:41:24.796]  And then they do brainwave tests.
[02:41:25.136 --> 02:41:27.058]  Most of the public is in a dream state.
[02:41:27.818 --> 02:41:37.567]  In fact, and the scary part is, plug it in with additional data entry through the cell phones and all the other nonsense that's being utilized and you, well, you can see the end result.
[02:41:37.868 --> 02:41:38.128]  Zombies.
[02:41:38.148 --> 02:41:40.350]  Don't forget the Prozac, Ritalin, Halcyon.
[02:41:41.050 --> 02:41:41.971]  Chad, what else?
[02:41:42.031 --> 02:41:43.112]  What was the name of the publication?
[02:41:43.453 --> 02:41:49.018]  It's called the Police Chief Magazine, and you can go to their website, it's Police Chief Magazine.
[02:41:49.574 --> 02:41:56.136]  And they talk about how Chicago will be nuked and how they'll take our freedoms and health?
[02:41:56.296 --> 02:42:03.717]  Full graphs in color, showing the mushroom cloud, the blast radius from downtown Chicago.
[02:42:03.777 --> 02:42:07.358]  And that's why we've got to be federalized and take all the guns, because the citizens are bad.
[02:42:07.858 --> 02:42:08.298]  Exactly.
[02:42:08.318 --> 02:42:09.159]  What does it get into?
[02:42:09.899 --> 02:42:12.319]  What issue was that?
[02:42:12.539 --> 02:42:19.121]  February 2008 issue of PoliceChiefMagazine.org, if you look on their archives and their webpage.
[02:42:19.485 --> 02:42:20.385]  Police Chief Marlin.
[02:42:21.366 --> 02:42:34.291]  And it's very graphic and talks about a 10 kiloton nuclear warhead going off at ground level in Chicago and the mortality rate and what kind of prevention.
[02:42:34.311 --> 02:42:43.395]  They talk about, you know, radioactive dirty bombs as well later on in the article and some of the preventative measures that they should do.
[02:42:43.475 --> 02:42:47.417]  But with Mark talking earlier and with you talking even yesterday about
[02:42:48.078 --> 02:42:55.022]  The military going into Chicago sounds to me like they're gearing up for another false flag attack.
[02:42:55.663 --> 02:42:58.925]  And sacrificing troops in the process because they would be in the epicenter.
[02:42:59.085 --> 02:43:00.506]  Yeah, I'm on the website, February 2000.
[02:43:00.866 --> 02:43:04.468]  It's got helicopters and trains and emergency workers on the front?
[02:43:04.949 --> 02:43:05.389]  That's correct.
[02:43:05.976 --> 02:43:12.561]  Okay, year prevention at any crime business schools, the demands of capacity, fusion centers, that's the martial law.
[02:43:13.102 --> 02:43:14.623]  Minimizing nuclear threat.
[02:43:14.863 --> 02:43:16.805]  I got it, local law enforcement strategy.
[02:43:16.925 --> 02:43:23.990]  The best way we could minimize nuclear threat is for every person to be personally equipped and prepared and not a single government agency is doing that.
[02:43:24.330 --> 02:43:24.951]  Of course, no, no.
[02:43:24.971 --> 02:43:31.356]  Think about it, I mean, I'm going to say it again, everybody needs a gas mask because it serves both chemical, biological, and nuclear threat.
[02:43:32.546 --> 02:43:39.128]  Even if you had any simple system that would be even 40 years old, it would provide some form of protection.
[02:43:39.728 --> 02:43:41.528]  Now, you can upgrade the systems accordingly.
[02:43:41.568 --> 02:43:42.909]  We don't have to go 40 years old.
[02:43:43.309 --> 02:43:45.069]  There's a whole bunch of systems out there.
[02:43:45.869 --> 02:43:50.070]  MainMilitary.com, TheEpicenter.com.
[02:43:50.150 --> 02:43:56.552]  TheEpicenter.com, guys, has chem suits, NATO standard, with the boots, with the gloves, $20 with the bag.
[02:43:58.371 --> 02:44:03.072]  Everything there in size large, which means it'll fit a lot of smaller people and it'll fit a lot of big people.
[02:44:03.472 --> 02:44:05.993]  Yeah, this isn't loading for some reason, but I'm on it.
[02:44:06.293 --> 02:44:07.013]  Thank you, caller.
[02:44:07.073 --> 02:44:07.553]  Great job.
[02:44:07.633 --> 02:44:08.073]  Absolutely.
[02:44:08.093 --> 02:44:13.535]  Let's take two final calls from Mark, then we're going to go out of here with a visitor from the past that Mark plays at the start of his radio show.
[02:44:14.995 --> 02:44:17.256]  Let's go ahead and go to Bandit in Nashville.
[02:44:17.296 --> 02:44:18.156]  Bandit, you're on the air.
[02:44:18.176 --> 02:44:19.836]  Hey, guys.
[02:44:20.076 --> 02:44:26.318]  I just wanted to echo a point you were making earlier as far as what your grandparents taught you.
[02:44:27.099 --> 02:44:27.240]  Okay.
[02:44:32.748 --> 02:44:37.511]  Not to trust the television, that it was literally a brainwashing device in everyone's living room.
[02:44:38.132 --> 02:44:44.356]  And then that kind of became a meme, where it was Grandma saying, don't stand too close to that, it hurts your eyes.
[02:44:44.736 --> 02:44:49.300]  No, they didn't trust it, because they said that idiot box makes you docile.
[02:44:49.700 --> 02:44:50.240]  Well, it does.
[02:44:50.260 --> 02:44:58.186]  I mean, I turned the TV on Monday to watch Jesse Ventura announce he wasn't going to run, and like in two minutes I caught myself just, Mark, this is a true story, my uncle,
[02:44:59.298 --> 02:45:02.681]  Was visiting and so we got the TV out because he only watches college ball.
[02:45:02.701 --> 02:45:05.103]  He only watches TV literally like once a year when it's on.
[02:45:06.043 --> 02:45:07.905]  And we're watching and I go, don't you see that?
[02:45:07.985 --> 02:45:11.568]  Every minute they're flashing different advertisements for about half a second.
[02:45:11.668 --> 02:45:13.830]  You know, before it was a millisecond, now it's half a second.
[02:45:14.450 --> 02:45:15.831]  And it was like Home Depot ads and stuff.
[02:45:15.851 --> 02:45:16.692]  He said, no, I don't see it.
[02:45:16.732 --> 02:45:24.979]  It took like five minutes of him trying to focus and stop leaning back in the chair, even though he knows all about the New World Order, knew about it decades ago, to go, oh my God, I just saw that!
[02:45:25.439 --> 02:45:43.196]  I mean, it's everywhere, folks, and how they do it is one way, not just the flicker rate, is they'll have all these TV screens in the back, say on CNN or Fox, and your brain can't take in everything that's happening with the TV screens with, you know, a plane crash, a flooding, bush on a tarmac, Iraq bombs going off.
[02:45:43.917 --> 02:45:46.578]  Your brain is taking it all in, but only the subconscious can.
[02:45:46.798 --> 02:45:58.122]  That puts you into an unconscious absorption mode, while Anderson Cooper stands in front with a scroll in front, talking directly in, in a very monotone, controlled voice, programming you.
[02:45:58.182 --> 02:46:04.704]  Now that is bottom line, only one facet of dozens of systems with a combined force attacking you.
[02:46:04.844 --> 02:46:08.185]  Real quick on that guys, the pattern is, it's either an X or Z pattern.
[02:46:08.225 --> 02:46:09.746]  Watch the, when you see the flickering,
[02:46:10.501 --> 02:46:15.744]  Watch and you'll notice that it goes, what they're doing is putting you into second tier or third tier REM sleep.
[02:46:16.424 --> 02:46:19.206]  Actually, even though it's conscious, your subconscious is registering it.
[02:46:19.246 --> 02:46:29.531]  You'll notice you go across the screen from upper right to lower left, from lower left to lower right, and then it'll actually reverse in an hourglass pattern or it'll be in an X pattern.
[02:46:29.611 --> 02:46:33.013]  And they'll have little blue mists and things and they'll put subliminals in there?
[02:46:33.053 --> 02:46:36.195]  It's exactly designed to put you into a specific state of mind.
[02:46:36.755 --> 02:46:38.196]  This research has been done for years.
[02:46:38.621 --> 02:46:39.421]  Do a dot pattern.
[02:46:39.481 --> 02:46:40.702]  Defocus the screen.
[02:46:40.762 --> 02:46:41.502]  Here's a cool one.
[02:46:41.602 --> 02:46:47.364]  Defocus the screen and watch the highlighting and where it travels on the screen.
[02:46:48.565 --> 02:46:49.165]  Absolutely.
[02:46:49.185 --> 02:46:51.386]  I mean, it's public.
[02:46:51.426 --> 02:46:55.007]  That's just taught in marketing now, but the public doesn't believe it because you're in zombie mode.
[02:46:56.007 --> 02:46:58.848]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Bandit.
[02:46:58.868 --> 02:46:59.349]  We've got to end this.
[02:46:59.569 --> 02:47:00.649]  We already talked to Bandit.
[02:47:01.409 --> 02:47:02.330]  Greg in Hollywood.
[02:47:02.370 --> 02:47:02.890]  Last caller.
[02:47:02.930 --> 02:47:03.230]  Go ahead.
[02:47:03.976 --> 02:47:04.996]  Alex, so great to be on.
[02:47:05.136 --> 02:47:06.156]  I listen every day at work.
[02:47:06.236 --> 02:47:08.297]  So, Mark, it's a blessing right now.
[02:47:08.357 --> 02:47:18.039]  So, I just want to say real fast, today's been great because you combined how the whole New World Order combines with biblical prophecy, which is what I've wrestled with for many years, ten years.
[02:47:18.579 --> 02:47:28.421]  My question is, I play in a band that's my only outlet to try to tell people about this stuff, but there's a point being in Hollywood, I see everybody around me that nobody sees it.
[02:47:28.741 --> 02:47:33.822]  And so, and even if they do, they're on the way liberal side and can't understand the religious aspect.
[02:47:34.454 --> 02:47:36.314]  So I'm at a point where do I escape?
[02:47:37.035 --> 02:47:40.235]  Do I run away to Montana where there's more people that would be on the same page?
[02:47:40.255 --> 02:47:42.836]  Well, try different ways of doing it.
[02:47:43.076 --> 02:47:44.436]  Try instead of talking yourself.
[02:47:44.496 --> 02:47:45.417]  Give them an endgame.
[02:47:45.677 --> 02:47:48.017]  Give them a terror storm.
[02:47:48.337 --> 02:47:49.338]  Start a website.
[02:47:49.378 --> 02:47:50.798]  Don't just have the band thing.
[02:47:50.818 --> 02:47:55.779]  Because people in there, you know, multiple attacks, lots of different things.
[02:47:55.879 --> 02:47:57.860]  Be generalist like Mark always says.
[02:47:57.920 --> 02:47:58.160]  Mark?
[02:47:58.660 --> 02:48:02.861]  Well, the other thing too is remember with the band, by the way, give us an email at liberty
[02:48:04.585 --> 02:48:06.247]  At Symbol Provide.net.
[02:48:06.327 --> 02:48:10.450]  One of the things we do is we play Patriot music and Patriot-oriented music.
[02:48:11.251 --> 02:48:11.491]  Okay.
[02:48:11.611 --> 02:48:15.134]  Actually, I sent two CDs, Alex, with my Money Bomb back in the day.
[02:48:15.174 --> 02:48:17.156]  It was called Last Days and Struggle Within.
[02:48:17.196 --> 02:48:17.736]  So look for those.
[02:48:17.757 --> 02:48:18.317]  The good stuff.
[02:48:18.337 --> 02:48:19.618]  Magnuson is the band name.
[02:48:19.638 --> 02:48:20.119]  But anyway.
[02:48:20.779 --> 02:48:21.580]  So I'll send that to you, Mark.
[02:48:21.600 --> 02:48:22.180]  Definitely.
[02:48:22.240 --> 02:48:23.862]  Tell me the email again.
[02:48:24.222 --> 02:48:27.865]  Liberty At Symbol Provide.net.
[02:48:28.939 --> 02:48:30.100]  We've got to end this now.
[02:48:30.140 --> 02:48:32.301]  We've got to end this now.
[02:48:32.381 --> 02:48:33.722]  Mark, thank you so much.
[02:48:34.062 --> 02:48:35.143]  You're on for an hour and a half.
[02:48:35.163 --> 02:48:44.288]  We're talking about militia and training and how to not be infiltrated and all of that for an hour and a half next Wednesday at noon because I really want to have you be a big part of the show.
[02:48:44.548 --> 02:48:47.410]  We really appreciate you, Mark, and say hi to everybody out there.
[02:48:47.670 --> 02:48:49.571]  We're going to go out with Visitor from the Past.
[02:48:49.651 --> 02:48:53.193]  Briefly, tell folks the story about this that you've been airing for 15 plus years.
[02:48:53.433 --> 02:48:56.494]  Phelan Polk is a poet who is from the western side of Michigan.
[02:48:56.534 --> 02:48:57.315]  We didn't know who it was.
[02:48:57.375 --> 02:49:01.477]  Many people have heard of him from the past or seen him printed in newspapers with author unknown.
[02:49:01.737 --> 02:49:08.980]  Phelan Polk, a Vietnam veteran, wrote this as part of a series of poems back in the 70s.
[02:49:09.861 --> 02:49:19.925]  The original poem you're going to hear was then read by an Arizona highway patrolman who sent us this copy originally back in 1993
[02:49:21.491 --> 02:49:27.176]  And as soon as we heard it, we knew it had to be the opening of every program we would ever do, and it has been ever since.
[02:49:27.496 --> 02:49:28.056]  All right, Mark.
[02:49:28.096 --> 02:49:28.817]  Thanks for everything.
[02:49:28.897 --> 02:49:31.860]  We will talk to you coming up next week.
[02:49:32.080 --> 02:49:32.440]  Thank you.
[02:49:32.500 --> 02:49:33.101]  God bless, Alex.
[02:49:33.141 --> 02:49:33.661]  Take care.
[02:49:34.241 --> 02:49:35.523]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:49:35.803 --> 02:49:46.572]  We're going to end the transmission now with this three-minute spoken word, and then retransmission begins with big guest info, powerful information at InfoWars.com.
[02:49:46.612 --> 02:49:47.933]  In fact, the next hour you're going to hear
[02:49:48.453 --> 02:49:55.839]  from the rebroadcast, because it'll be in the second hour right when we start, was where I went through all the stuff they're doing, or a large portion of it, for 30 minutes.
[02:49:56.020 --> 02:49:56.700]  Very important.
[02:49:56.720 --> 02:49:58.342]  Then Bob Chapman joined us.
[02:49:59.002 --> 02:50:00.503]  Here is a visitor from the past.
[02:50:00.643 --> 02:50:05.167]  Be sure and visit InfoWars.com, and I'll see you live on the radio Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:50:05.207 --> 02:50:08.350]  Remember, we spread the word by you telling folks about the radio show.
[02:50:08.670 --> 02:50:14.635]  That's another way to wake people up, is point them towards people that do this professionally, who really know how to show people what's happening.
[02:50:15.536 --> 02:50:19.980]  I humbly think my radio show is among the best, and we have all the best guests here as well, as we just evidenced.
[02:50:20.400 --> 02:50:23.542]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, this is the final defense of the Republic.
[02:50:24.263 --> 02:50:25.964]  Here is a visitor from the past.
[02:50:34.611 --> 02:50:37.453]  I had a dream the other night that, well, I didn't understand.
[02:50:38.474 --> 02:50:41.756]  A figure walked in through the mist with a flintlock in his hand.
[02:50:42.782 --> 02:50:45.423]  His clothes were torn and dirty as he stood there by my bed.
[02:50:46.364 --> 02:50:54.088]  He took off his three-cornered hat and, speaking low to me, he said, We fought a revolution to secure our liberty.
[02:50:54.808 --> 02:50:57.710]  We wrote the Constitution as a shield from tyranny.
[02:50:58.610 --> 02:51:01.132]  For future generations, this legacy we gave.
[02:51:01.972 --> 02:51:05.174]  In this, the land of the free and home of the brave.
[02:51:06.403 --> 02:51:10.007]  The freedoms we secured for you, we hoped you'd always keep.
[02:51:10.628 --> 02:51:13.712]  But tyrants labored endlessly while your parents were asleep.
[02:51:14.833 --> 02:51:18.037]  Your freedom's gone, your courage lost, you're no more than a slave.
[02:51:18.978 --> 02:51:22.222]  In this, the land of the free, and home of the brave.
[02:51:23.598 --> 02:51:26.079]  You buy permits to travel and permits to own a gun.
[02:51:26.779 --> 02:51:29.459]  Permits to start a business or to build a place for one.
[02:51:30.179 --> 02:51:33.260]  On land that you believe you own, you pay a yearly rent.
[02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:36.581]  Although you have no voice in saying how the money's spent.
[02:51:37.641 --> 02:51:40.361]  Your children must attend a school that doesn't educate.
[02:51:41.162 --> 02:51:45.502]  And your Christian values can't be taught according to the state.
[02:51:46.663 --> 02:51:49.023]  You read about the current news in a regulated press.
[02:51:49.583 --> 02:51:52.944]  And you pay a tax you do not owe to please the IRS.
[02:51:54.244 --> 02:51:56.725]  Your money is no longer made of silver nor of gold.
[02:51:57.405 --> 02:52:00.587]  You trade your wealth for paper, so your life can be controlled.
[02:52:01.687 --> 02:52:05.749]  You pay for crimes that make our nation turn from God and shame.
[02:52:06.649 --> 02:52:08.410]  You've taken Satan's number.
[02:52:09.330 --> 02:52:10.571]  You've traded in your name.
[02:52:12.028 --> 02:52:19.051]  You've given government control to those who do you harm, so they can burn down churches and seize the family farm.
[02:52:19.912 --> 02:52:22.093]  And keep our country deep in debt.
[02:52:22.453 --> 02:52:23.693]  Put men of God in jail.
[02:52:24.013 --> 02:52:27.015]  Harass your fellow countrymen while corrupted courts prevail.
[02:52:27.935 --> 02:52:30.856]  Your public servants don't uphold the solemn oaths they've sworn.
[02:52:31.957 --> 02:52:35.899]  And your daughters visit doctors so their children won't be born.
[02:52:37.651 --> 02:52:45.536]  Your leaders send artillery and guns to foreign shores and send your sons to slaughter fighting other people's wars!
[02:52:47.017 --> 02:52:49.618]  Can you regain the freedoms for which we fought and died?
[02:52:50.299 --> 02:52:53.100]  Or don't you have the courage or the faith to stand with pride?
[02:52:54.001 --> 02:52:56.823]  And are there no more values for which you'll fight to save?
[02:52:56.843 --> 02:53:01.505]  Or do you wish your children to live in fear and be a slave?
[02:53:03.217 --> 02:53:05.278]  Oh, sons of the Republic, arise!
[02:53:05.638 --> 02:53:06.619]  Take a stand!
[02:53:06.639 --> 02:53:09.821]  Defend the Constitution, the supreme law of the land!
[02:53:10.721 --> 02:53:13.923]  Preserve our great Republic and each God-given right!
[02:53:15.084 --> 02:53:18.826]  And pray to God to keep the torch of freedom burning bright!
[02:53:20.667 --> 02:53:23.249]  As I awoke, he'd vanished in the mist from whence he came.
[02:53:24.069 --> 02:53:24.970]  His words were true.
[02:53:25.470 --> 02:53:28.452]  We are not free, but we have ourselves to blame.
[02:53:29.537 --> 02:53:35.540]  For even now as tyrants trample each God-given right, we only watch and tremble, too afraid to stand and fight.
[02:53:36.640 --> 02:53:54.149]  If he stood by your bedside in a dream while you were asleep and wondered what remains of the freedoms he'd fought to keep, what would be your answer if he called out from the grave, is this still the land of the free and home of the brave?
[02:53:55.969 --> 02:53:59.131]  God bless you, and God bless this
