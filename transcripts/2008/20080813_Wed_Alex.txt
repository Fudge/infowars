[00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.113]  All of the folks I've been issuing visas to.
[00:00:03.596 --> 00:00:07.363]  Then we have the evidence that there were foreign governments involved.
[00:00:07.423 --> 00:00:09.787]  Most of that information is classified.
[00:00:09.807 --> 00:00:11.290]  I think overly classified.
[00:00:16.705 --> 00:00:17.587]  Osama bin Laden.
[00:00:18.027 --> 00:00:19.069]  Osama bin Laden.
[00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:20.551]  Osama bin Laden.
[00:00:20.731 --> 00:00:22.514]  Osama bin Laden.
[00:00:22.654 --> 00:00:26.980]  Remember 24 hours ago, it was the Bush tax cut, the Bush budget, the Bush economy.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.701]  Live in 30 seconds.
[00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:29.063]  You don't hear any of that tonight.
[00:00:29.564 --> 00:00:30.765]  It's America's enemy.
[00:00:31.086 --> 00:00:32.388]  America's under attack.
[00:00:40.029 --> 00:00:40.369]  You're live.
[00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:42.910]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I am really excited.
[00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.011]  He's a really nice guy.
[00:00:44.531 --> 00:00:47.853]  I guess that's why he's already a major police chief in a major city as young as he is.
[00:00:48.193 --> 00:00:52.695]  And he's got a long bio here, but I thought that he was for the rest of the hour being very gracious about that.
[00:00:53.195 --> 00:00:59.458]  Art Alcivedo, he is the Austin police chief who's now been in what, close to a year or so?
[00:00:59.478 --> 00:01:00.158]  A little over.
[00:01:00.178 --> 00:01:00.958]  A little over a year.
[00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:02.079]  And we're honored to have you, sir.
[00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:03.219]  Good to be here.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.060]  Finally get to meet you.
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.003]  Well, it's great to have you in studio with us today.
[00:01:08.484 --> 00:01:14.729]  Just out of the gate, instead of reading your lengthy bio, tell us a little bit about yourself, because this is an international audience, obviously, not just in Austin.
[00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.991]  Okay, well, I'm 44 years old.
[00:01:17.011 --> 00:01:22.676]  I'm a proud father of three kids, a 19-year-old, a 16-year-old, and a 4-month-old.
[00:01:23.617 --> 00:01:25.058]  I was born in Havana, Cuba.
[00:01:25.078 --> 00:01:27.060]  I migrated to the United States.
[00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.022]  One of the lucky ones, I got out of Cuba in 1968.
[00:01:31.684 --> 00:01:38.354]  I always wanted to be a cop, became a cop, loved being a cop, and I did it out of a desire to really serve.
[00:01:38.394 --> 00:01:39.195]  I love people.
[00:01:39.736 --> 00:01:46.185]  I think being a cop is really about dealing with people, and if you can deal with people who have people skills, you can be very successful at policing.
[00:01:47.423 --> 00:01:50.968]  Now obviously, you've got courage coming into the lines down here.
[00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:58.498]  Well, hey, I frisked you down, I don't see any weapons on you, so words can't kill you, I hope.
[00:01:58.778 --> 00:02:01.382]  No, no, listen, listen, we have always wanted a relationship with the police.
[00:02:02.483 --> 00:02:11.329]  You know, I don't like the fact, and I've probably been bad in the past, bashing police too much, and that kind of compacts police into their own little culture, instead of having the public and the police interface.
[00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:20.515]  And I know that since you've gotten in, you've done a lot of things I've actually really agreed with, some things I've disagreed with, and really have been interfacing with the media, the public.
[00:02:20.575 --> 00:02:25.458]  I mean, you've got to be the hardest working police chief I've ever seen living in Austin for the last 18 years.
[00:02:26.018 --> 00:02:26.438]  Well, great.
[00:02:26.478 --> 00:02:27.399]  Well, thank you for that.
[00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:28.360]  And, you know, it's important.
[00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.641]  Look, we have nothing to hide.
[00:02:30.462 --> 00:02:33.785]  I really believe that through transparency comes trust.
[00:02:33.905 --> 00:02:37.448]  And the more transparent we are, the more we engage the community.
[00:02:37.848 --> 00:02:41.151]  Sometimes we're going to have to agree to disagree, and that's okay.
[00:02:41.511 --> 00:02:44.714]  But we have to have a dialogue because that's what's going to breed trust.
[00:02:45.195 --> 00:02:47.937]  And with trust, I think, comes safety and a better quality of life for all of us.
[00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.371]  Now, Chief, I've got a lot of questions here for you.
[00:02:50.391 --> 00:02:51.692]  Okay, I'll bow the answers.
[00:02:51.812 --> 00:02:55.354]  Out of the gate, though, tell us about your philosophy before we go to this break in just a moment.
[00:02:55.654 --> 00:02:58.316]  Your philosophy versus some of your predecessors.
[00:02:59.156 --> 00:03:04.320]  Well, my philosophy, I think, is transparency and accountability are the two most important things to me.
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.702]  If we're transparent, I really believe we have a pretty darn good department, so why not be transparent?
[00:03:08.722 --> 00:03:10.723]  And why not put the good, the bad, and the ugly out there?
[00:03:11.484 --> 00:03:16.367]  Because by doing that, people start realizing that we have nothing to hide and they can actually trust us.
[00:03:17.187 --> 00:03:22.853]  And I think in the past we really haven't engaged as an organization, the community, the media, your critics.
[00:03:23.874 --> 00:03:32.741]  Some people run away from activists, I actually run towards them, because I want to know what they have to say and I want them to know what I feel, what I believe, so at least we can have that mutual respect.
[00:03:33.482 --> 00:03:34.583]  Well, there have been big changes.
[00:03:34.943 --> 00:03:39.668]  Also, in the past, if Austin police shot somebody in the back, they would not get in trouble.
[00:03:39.908 --> 00:03:41.990]  Now, they have been getting in trouble.
[00:03:42.796 --> 00:03:45.537]  Well, you know, you're talking about the Kevin Brown shooting.
[00:03:45.577 --> 00:03:49.838]  That was a tragic event for everybody involved, including the sergeant who was fired.
[00:03:49.878 --> 00:03:53.339]  But the reality is, we've got to call them as we see them.
[00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:55.400]  I know the community likes some of the calls.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.700]  They'll dislike some of the calls.
[00:03:57.081 --> 00:04:07.624]  But I think if people know your heart and they know that you actually care and that you're trying to do the right thing, they may not agree with you, but at least they'll respect the fact that you're trying and that your heart's in the right place, which is important.
[00:04:08.683 --> 00:04:09.444]  Well, absolutely.
[00:04:09.544 --> 00:04:12.667]  And you've done some other things that have been good.
[00:04:13.048 --> 00:04:21.137]  And I've been happy to see police and the union not attacking you as much because they understand that if they don't clean house, it's just going to be downhill.
[00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:23.104]  You know, and that's true.
[00:04:24.085 --> 00:04:26.407]  The reality is we don't have that much cleaning to do.
[00:04:26.427 --> 00:04:38.416]  The majority of our cops are really hard-working, dedicated professionals, but it doesn't take more than one or two or three or a handful to really diminish the excellence and destroy the excellence in the bridges that we're building.
[00:04:38.736 --> 00:04:39.897]  I'll tell you what, we're going to break.
[00:04:39.917 --> 00:04:40.978]  That's a great place to leave it off.
[00:04:40.998 --> 00:04:41.538]  Stay there, sir.
[00:04:41.798 --> 00:04:44.881]  Back in just a few minutes with the Austin Police Chief in studio with us.
[00:04:53.012 --> 00:04:59.214]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:07.436]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:05:07.796 --> 00:05:15.658]  Is this a flaw of free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:20.699]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:25.762]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:05:26.263 --> 00:05:30.125]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:05:30.625 --> 00:05:31.626]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:35.789]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:05:36.209 --> 00:05:40.592]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:05:41.112 --> 00:05:43.614]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:05:44.094 --> 00:05:46.675]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:05:47.996 --> 00:05:49.777]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:05:52.618 --> 00:05:58.081]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[00:05:58.341 --> 00:05:59.662]  And we knew what to do.
[00:05:59.682 --> 00:06:01.423]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:06:01.663 --> 00:06:08.086]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:06:08.686 --> 00:06:11.908]  Whitman, EPA Director,
[00:06:12.375 --> 00:06:17.184]  On the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:06:17.574 --> 00:06:24.398]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:06:24.678 --> 00:06:27.740]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:33.063]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[00:06:33.623 --> 00:06:36.245]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:06:36.705 --> 00:06:43.929]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at
[00:06:48.676 --> 00:06:58.905]  I am at a gathering of friends, minding my own business, when one of our buddies, Bob, walks up to me, very concerned, and he says, Wow!
[00:06:59.146 --> 00:07:00.887]  Have you seen the gasoline prices lately?
[00:07:00.907 --> 00:07:01.668]  And I said, Oh, of course!
[00:07:02.148 --> 00:07:02.468]  Woo!
[00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:02.949]  They're high!
[00:07:03.359 --> 00:07:03.800]  He says, yeah.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:04.661]  He says, what am I going to do?
[00:07:04.961 --> 00:07:05.502]  I've got a truck.
[00:07:05.542 --> 00:07:08.126]  There's no way anybody's going to buy my truck in this market.
[00:07:08.446 --> 00:07:10.049]  I really need the truck for my job.
[00:07:10.369 --> 00:07:12.051]  It uses more gas than I can afford.
[00:07:12.372 --> 00:07:14.315]  I've got to find a way to come up with some extra money.
[00:07:14.335 --> 00:07:15.997]  I've got a wife with four kids at home.
[00:07:16.277 --> 00:07:17.039]  I don't know what to do.
[00:07:17.059 --> 00:07:18.300]  I said, Bob, relax.
[00:07:18.441 --> 00:07:19.101]  I know what to do.
[00:07:19.682 --> 00:07:23.783]  Call eFoodsDirect.com or go up on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:07:23.983 --> 00:07:34.146]  They will deliver food, really good, high-quality, nutritional, delicious food to your door, your door now, right there in front of your house, for about half the price that you were paying for groceries last year.
[00:07:34.507 --> 00:07:42.089]  You can take the savings from that, offset the cost of your fuel, and use it to buy more inexpensive food to hedge against tomorrow's increasing food prices.
[00:07:42.349 --> 00:07:43.310]  Why don't you do that, Bob?
[00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:44.572]  He said, EFoodsDirect.com?
[00:07:44.592 --> 00:07:45.473]  I said, yep, call them at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:07:45.534 --> 00:07:45.854]  That's 1-800-409-5633.
[00:07:45.874 --> 00:07:46.114]  Do it now.
[00:07:57.858 --> 00:07:59.299]  If you wash your car, how long does it last?
[00:07:59.599 --> 00:08:00.120]  Three days?
[00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:00.700]  A week?
[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:01.480]  Two weeks?
[00:08:01.961 --> 00:08:07.104]  Life Change Tea eliminates chemicals, toxins and parasites and much more.
[00:08:07.425 --> 00:08:07.905]  The effect?
[00:08:08.145 --> 00:08:08.906]  You lose weight.
[00:08:09.146 --> 00:08:10.226]  That's right, you lose weight.
[00:08:10.547 --> 00:08:11.727]  So here's the story.
[00:08:11.908 --> 00:08:13.909]  You wash your car, it gets dirty again.
[00:08:14.049 --> 00:08:16.771]  You cleanse your body, chemicals and toxins come back.
[00:08:17.171 --> 00:08:17.591]  The fix?
[00:08:18.112 --> 00:08:19.052]  Stay on the tea!
[00:08:19.293 --> 00:08:20.854]  And here's how we will help.
[00:08:21.214 --> 00:08:24.396]  Ask for the Mid-State Fair Special when ordering.
[00:08:24.616 --> 00:08:25.417]  Here's how to order.
[00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:28.100]  Online, getthetea.com.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.444]  That's getthetea.com.
[00:08:30.564 --> 00:08:31.625]  Or call us, 928-308-0408.
[00:08:31.665 --> 00:08:32.106]  That's 928-308-0408.
[00:08:32.166 --> 00:08:32.767]  Get the tea.
[00:08:32.787 --> 00:08:35.971]  Restoring America's health, one teabag at a time.
[00:08:57.671 --> 00:09:01.914]  Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo is our guest in studio.
[00:09:02.735 --> 00:09:05.117]  And now we can start the interrogation.
[00:09:05.137 --> 00:09:05.677]  Here we go.
[00:09:05.857 --> 00:09:06.978]  You like the interrogation room?
[00:09:06.998 --> 00:09:08.619]  We have lots of lights, a little bit of room.
[00:09:08.779 --> 00:09:12.902]  I like the padding, you know, so when you get rough with me, I know I'm not going to hurt myself too badly.
[00:09:13.723 --> 00:09:17.785]  You know, I'm surprised that you didn't bring a whole entourage with you.
[00:09:18.085 --> 00:09:22.907]  Because other awesome police chiefs I've noticed would normally have an entourage, and then guys out in the parking lot.
[00:09:23.347 --> 00:09:30.349]  I've worked at a few of the radio stations doing my show out of there, and the police chiefs would be coming on other shows sometimes, and you'd see guys in the parking lot looking around.
[00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:34.771]  No, I'm a one-man traveling show.
[00:09:34.851 --> 00:09:42.374]  I brought Ana Sabam, she's our public information manager, and I think that it's important for her to meet the folks out here in the media so you can have a relationship with our office.
[00:09:43.499 --> 00:09:45.420]  Okay, let's get into the tough questions in this short segment.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.141]  We've got a long one coming up after the next break.
[00:09:48.402 --> 00:09:49.163]  Plate scanning.
[00:09:49.383 --> 00:09:53.626]  They've announced all over the country, the Feds have put in these license plate reading cameras.
[00:09:53.686 --> 00:09:54.746]  Police cars are getting them.
[00:09:55.327 --> 00:09:57.088]  It's all part of this larger NORTHCOM grid.
[00:09:57.108 --> 00:09:58.529]  You have the emergency management centers.
[00:09:58.789 --> 00:10:04.715]  Where they're bringing in the National Guard, threat assessment, threat matrix systems, this whole NORTHCOM grid.
[00:10:05.476 --> 00:10:13.724]  The last police you've actually interviewed in person was the police chief of San Antonio, Allie Philippus, when Delta Force tried to bribe him and ended up in the paper to run covert operations in the city.
[00:10:14.405 --> 00:10:15.186]  Your take on all that.
[00:10:15.919 --> 00:10:22.765]  Well, I think any technology, it's not the technology that is bad or evil or anything else, it's how you use it.
[00:10:23.306 --> 00:10:30.792]  License plate readers are a good tool when you're looking for, on an AMBER Alert, a partial plate on a kid that's been kidnapped, you can actually program that system.
[00:10:31.233 --> 00:10:39.040]  Let's say it's 123 SAM, and all you have is 123, and it'll spit out any car, it'll identify, here's a car that you're looking for.
[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:44.603]  So, it helps us in terms of finding wanted vehicles and recovering stolen cars.
[00:10:45.223 --> 00:10:50.466]  With that said, if we bring it here, it's solely for our local law enforcement use and nothing else.
[00:10:51.226 --> 00:10:55.348]  But those grids, those grants are paid for by the Feds, and if you'd like me to give you documents, I can.
[00:10:55.388 --> 00:10:58.350]  They're also feeding into that with NSA technology.
[00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:00.291]  Well, I'm not aware of that.
[00:11:00.311 --> 00:11:01.051]  That's something I've never heard of.
[00:11:01.071 --> 00:11:04.933]  Okay, well what about the gunshot detectors they started putting up in 1998, which are really microphones?
[00:11:05.982 --> 00:11:07.263]  Gunshot detectors, we don't have them here.
[00:11:07.443 --> 00:11:11.204]  We're very fortunate that we have a city that's a very safe city.
[00:11:11.384 --> 00:11:14.085]  What about the grants that announced in 1998 that were putting them in in East Austin?
[00:11:14.865 --> 00:11:15.586]  We don't have them here.
[00:11:15.886 --> 00:11:19.107]  I mean, if we have them, I haven't seen them or heard about them, so that's news to me!
[00:11:20.728 --> 00:11:22.910]  Well, those are federally put in, so I guess it's for the Fed boys.
[00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:27.514]  Yeah, the Austin Police Department does not have that technology here.
[00:11:28.495 --> 00:11:29.696]  What about menialization?
[00:11:29.716 --> 00:11:37.202]  I'm always hearing about our police being sent to Israel, or Israel coming over here, or our police being sent to Japan, to Tokyo, and then their officers can come over here and pick people up.
[00:11:37.503 --> 00:11:38.163]  We can go over there.
[00:11:38.183 --> 00:11:38.824]  What's going on with that?
[00:11:39.502 --> 00:11:46.904]  Well, what these are, some of those programs, actually exchange programs, where you actually go and look at some of their tactics in terms of security.
[00:11:46.924 --> 00:12:03.909]  I actually went on one myself where basically it was a tour of their facilities and just to learn from their experiences in terms of terrorism and things of that nature, but we have not had any delegation here that I'm aware of.
[00:12:05.484 --> 00:12:10.827]  I've got a film I made six years ago, so you may not be aware of the specifics of what I'm talking about, but I'm sure you are.
[00:12:11.147 --> 00:12:22.834]  The programs where the Austin police enroll the children with a $200 discount credit card, and they get the $200 for turning people in, reporting on drugs, crime, but they also tell them to go home and what's in the medicine cabinet.
[00:12:23.535 --> 00:12:24.555]  That sounds like East Germany.
[00:12:24.575 --> 00:12:25.616]  Are you aware of that Austin program?
[00:12:26.296 --> 00:12:27.598]  I don't think we have that program anymore.
[00:12:28.218 --> 00:12:32.822]  If you do, you need to let me know where it's happening because I can tell you that we're not in that business.
[00:12:32.862 --> 00:12:34.124]  But you were aware of that program.
[00:12:34.144 --> 00:12:36.546]  I mean, this was years ago here, but I'm told it's still going on.
[00:12:37.168 --> 00:12:37.948]  No.
[00:12:38.128 --> 00:12:41.310]  If it's going on, somebody needs to tell me where and when so I can look into that.
[00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:44.291]  I would not be in favor of a program of that sort.
[00:12:44.451 --> 00:12:48.412]  Well, what I'm going to do is we're going to go over this interview, and in a few months, I know you're a busy man, I'd like to have you back in.
[00:12:48.772 --> 00:12:59.436]  And I will have all the documents on each issue, and I will play the video of the Austin TV ad that they show inside the schools, where it told the kids, you know, you're going to get $200 for whoever you turn in.
[00:12:59.696 --> 00:13:00.877]  You're going to report on people.
[00:13:01.677 --> 00:13:04.498]  And then they have the children write essays about what's going on in their home life.
[00:13:05.666 --> 00:13:15.292]  Like I said, what happened back then I can't attest to, but I can tell you that we don't have a program like that today, and I would not be in favor of a program like that.
[00:13:15.312 --> 00:13:16.673]  Good, I like you even more.
[00:13:16.773 --> 00:13:18.074]  What about federalization?
[00:13:20.336 --> 00:13:26.479]  We have all this federal funds, unfunded mandates coming in, some funded, with the case of the blood taking.
[00:13:26.559 --> 00:13:32.003]  I know here, you're... Are you talking about my phlebotomy program that I talked about recently?
[00:13:32.023 --> 00:13:33.384]  Well, they're taking blood at checkpoints.
[00:13:33.404 --> 00:13:34.965]  They're dragging people off to have their blood taken.
[00:13:35.461 --> 00:13:39.425]  No, what's happened, I'm glad you brought that up, that's one of the reasons I'm here because I think it's really important.
[00:13:39.445 --> 00:13:43.329]  Look, we are in one of the worst states in the Union for drunk driving.
[00:13:43.369 --> 00:13:51.638]  Drunk driving is something that I brought some of the stats where 40,000 plus Americans a year are getting killed in this country.
[00:13:52.299 --> 00:13:54.761]  Nearly 2,000 Texans are getting killed from drunk driving.
[00:13:55.062 --> 00:13:55.562]  You can have them.
[00:13:55.843 --> 00:13:56.984]  I'm just going to show people on camera.
[00:13:57.844 --> 00:14:00.807]  And the reality is, it is carnage.
[00:14:01.347 --> 00:14:16.079]  What's happened, Alex, that a lot of folks, if they refuse a blood test, okay, that we need to get that evidence, a lot of hospitals don't want to take the blood for the department without a consent from the suspect because they don't want the liability.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.203]  The Travis County Sheriff's Department is now talking to us that their nurses aren't going to draw blood for us anymore.
[00:14:21.503 --> 00:14:24.426]  They don't want their nurses to have to go to court and be tied up.
[00:14:25.186 --> 00:14:30.250]  So what's happened is we've got to look at how can we get evidence that we need of a crime that's been committed.
[00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:30.750]  Hey, leave it there.
[00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:32.352]  We'll come right back to you and let you continue.
[00:14:32.712 --> 00:14:34.073]  We have the Austin Police Chief on.
[00:14:34.113 --> 00:14:34.773]  It's amazing.
[00:14:35.134 --> 00:14:36.375]  We're really happy to have him here.
[00:14:36.395 --> 00:14:37.656]  He's Art Acevedo.
[00:14:37.936 --> 00:14:38.576]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:14:38.596 --> 00:14:38.977]  Stay with us.
[00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:43.960]  We're on the march.
[00:14:44.461 --> 00:14:46.042]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:14:46.983 --> 00:14:49.685]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:15:05.965]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.

[00:15:10.567 --> 00:15:17.073]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:15:17.453 --> 00:15:20.656]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:15:20.876 --> 00:15:28.382]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:15:58.727 --> 00:16:01.730]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:08.537]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[00:16:08.917 --> 00:16:11.020]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.

[00:16:52.808 --> 00:17:01.211]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.

[00:18:03.556 --> 00:18:06.879]  Art Acevedo, Austin Police Chief, is our guest for the rest of the hour.
[00:18:07.539 --> 00:18:09.240]  Very charming devil, I have to say.
[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:12.042]  We'll be watching him very closely from this time forward.
[00:18:12.483 --> 00:18:14.244]  Well, I think the feeling is mutual.
[00:18:14.284 --> 00:18:14.804]  You know what?
[00:18:15.245 --> 00:18:16.726]  You're a teddy bear in person.
[00:18:16.766 --> 00:18:17.606]  I like watching you.
[00:18:17.646 --> 00:18:18.447]  I am a nice guy.
[00:18:18.507 --> 00:18:19.188]  You are a nice guy.
[00:18:19.208 --> 00:18:24.553]  I got intimidated by police that have been given federally paid for Darth Vader uniforms that aren't wearing badges.
[00:18:24.613 --> 00:18:33.561]  And you were talking earlier about seeing video of me on the web or TV or something where I'm going up to the police downtown who are in their riot gear and I'm just wanting to see their badges.
[00:18:33.861 --> 00:18:35.403]  That's why I was talking to them.
[00:18:35.862 --> 00:18:38.863]  Well, let me tell you something about our badges that I think you'll probably like.
[00:18:39.483 --> 00:18:43.805]  We now have, don't look at mine, mine's unique, I'm the police chief, if you can't figure out who I am, we're in trouble.
[00:18:44.505 --> 00:18:48.947]  Our badges now have the, you know how you ask, hey, do you have your badge number?
[00:18:48.967 --> 00:18:49.647]  Oh, it says chief!
[00:18:49.887 --> 00:18:54.069]  Well, mine does, but you know how you always say in the movies, hey, copper, I want your badge number.
[00:18:54.669 --> 00:18:58.871]  Well, our employee numbers and our badge numbers were completely different, so it didn't mean anything.
[00:18:59.391 --> 00:19:01.232]  Now, with this new badge that we have,
[00:19:01.952 --> 00:19:04.175]  The employee number and the badge number will be one and the same.
[00:19:04.215 --> 00:19:05.217]  No, you're really changing things.
[00:19:05.257 --> 00:19:13.890]  I mean, now they're wearing the old-fashioned, nice, fancy, respectable uniforms, not like goon outfits, and they're driving black and whites, and you've got their badge numbers and a big badge.
[00:19:14.198 --> 00:19:17.739]  And a big badge, so there's no doubt, and it's not a generic badge, and you know what?
[00:19:17.779 --> 00:19:28.983]  We've got some good police officers, they deserve better, and I think they deserve, they earn this privilege, because wearing this uniform, wearing this badge is a privilege they have to earn every day they come to work, and I think they've earned the privilege of wearing a unique symbol.
[00:19:29.003 --> 00:19:32.344]  Yeah, why have a lot of departments in the last 20 years gone into these maintenance uniforms?
[00:19:32.704 --> 00:19:35.705]  It looks like, you know, the maintenance guy at a university.
[00:19:36.365 --> 00:19:37.026]  Because you know what?
[00:19:37.086 --> 00:19:40.527]  People are looking for comfort, and we try to be the nice guy, and if they want to be in their
[00:19:41.567 --> 00:19:43.028]  We're kind of going the opposite direction.
[00:19:43.108 --> 00:19:46.131]  We're trying to tighten it up a little bit where we want people looking professional.
[00:19:46.971 --> 00:19:53.556]  We're going to have some pants that are kind of like cargo pants, but they're more tailored and they look cleaner for our guys on patrol.
[00:19:53.576 --> 00:19:57.699]  And we want some uniformity, so when you see an Austin police officer, they all look the same.
[00:19:57.719 --> 00:20:00.641]  In the past we had white cars with a blue stripe.
[00:20:00.701 --> 00:20:01.922]  Now you're going to the old black and white.
[00:20:02.267 --> 00:20:02.827]  Black and white.
[00:20:02.887 --> 00:20:04.408]  You know, there's a lot of white cars in this town.
[00:20:04.909 --> 00:20:05.809]  Everybody drives a white car.
[00:20:05.829 --> 00:20:07.070]  No, they stand out now, you know.
[00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:07.691]  Yeah, and you know.
[00:20:07.791 --> 00:20:09.172]  And the lights are very bright.
[00:20:10.553 --> 00:20:15.816]  And I want our citizens to know when they see a black and white that that's a police car, it's an Austin police car, and we're out there taking care of them.
[00:20:16.096 --> 00:20:22.441]  Alright, going back to the blood issue, you guys can say, well, this is nothing new, we're getting a warrant.
[00:20:23.462 --> 00:20:35.372]  In Illinois, Indiana, and in some areas of Texas, I've read that the police are taking it at night, out at the side of a road at a checkpoint, and that a lot of lawyers, and I've had the head of the Texas Bar on, are saying these aren't really real warrants that some of the cities have.
[00:20:35.652 --> 00:20:40.516]  It's a blank check warrant that basically the judges, just whatever's called in, are running with.
[00:20:40.556 --> 00:20:47.462]  Now, I haven't seen that claim with Austin, but still, there are concerns here about people who are hemophiliacs, people who are diabetics.
[00:20:48.002 --> 00:20:54.125]  I mean, I've had blood taken for insurance or whatever, and the nurse can't seem to find it herself, much less some cop at the side of the road.
[00:20:54.145 --> 00:20:55.085]  That's quite a line to pass.
[00:20:55.105 --> 00:20:56.446]  But it's not going to be on the side of the road.
[00:20:56.506 --> 00:20:57.586]  I think that that's the image.
[00:20:57.606 --> 00:20:58.787]  You know, I looked at some of the blogs.
[00:20:58.827 --> 00:20:59.347]  I like to listen.
[00:20:59.367 --> 00:21:01.308]  I like to watch and read what's going on in my city.
[00:21:01.988 --> 00:21:07.471]  And some of the comments were, I'm not going to have a bubba cop sit there on the side of the road, you know, give me liberty or give me death.
[00:21:07.491 --> 00:21:09.552]  They've been doing that in Denver.
[00:21:09.972 --> 00:21:14.723]  Well, this is going to be a program that if we do launch it, it's in response to a need.
[00:21:14.763 --> 00:21:17.971]  We have to get that evidence to try to hold some of these folks accountable.
[00:21:17.991 --> 00:21:18.773]  But it is a federal grant!
[00:21:19.679 --> 00:21:20.340]  If I can get it.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.061]  I don't know if I'll be able to get it.
[00:21:22.781 --> 00:21:33.289]  But it is to train a handful of police officers as phlebotomists, that in an instance where we arrest somebody for driving under the influence, especially when they've killed somebody, or seriously injured or maimed somebody.
[00:21:33.609 --> 00:21:36.271]  Remember that we've killed almost 2,000 Texans a year with drunk driving.
[00:21:36.632 --> 00:21:38.873]  We're the hardest drinking city according to Forbes.
[00:21:38.913 --> 00:21:40.855]  No, no, we're worse than New Orleans now.
[00:21:41.255 --> 00:21:43.076]  We sell the most alcohol.
[00:21:43.156 --> 00:21:48.981]  Listen, out in south of Austin, I was driving by, they've got a liquor store bigger than a Super Walmart.
[00:21:49.545 --> 00:22:08.689]  Oh yeah, and so Alex, I see you're a father, I'm a father, we're out here driving on these streets and these roadways and there is carnage going on and this is nothing more than using a lawful, and it will only be done in a lawful manner, in a sanitary condition, in a secure location, with some checks and balances.
[00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:20.141]  They shut down all of 35 from Kyle out to Round Rock, literally cars going one mile an hour with police shining lights in people's eyes under a federal grant.
[00:22:20.602 --> 00:22:24.507]  Why would the feds want to give us this money that we've already paid foreign taxes to do that?
[00:22:24.547 --> 00:22:25.849]  I mean, are we going to see stuff like that?
[00:22:26.451 --> 00:22:26.571]  No.
[00:22:27.112 --> 00:22:28.112]  We don't have checkpoints here.
[00:22:28.152 --> 00:22:32.756]  I think that you'd have to have a Texas legislature would have to approve checkpoints.
[00:22:32.776 --> 00:22:34.437]  But you heard about those big ones they had here, didn't you?
[00:22:34.477 --> 00:22:37.019]  No, I haven't heard about it.
[00:22:37.119 --> 00:22:38.160]  I'm the new guy, Alex!
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:38.920]  You're from L.A.
[00:22:39.041 --> 00:22:39.821]  I'm from L.A.
[00:22:39.921 --> 00:22:40.241]  I know.
[00:22:40.462 --> 00:22:41.643]  I'm from Texas now, buddy.
[00:22:41.663 --> 00:22:43.384]  The slick CIA command base.
[00:22:44.064 --> 00:22:44.685]  Is it L.A.?
[00:22:45.285 --> 00:22:46.546]  God, they can do better than that.
[00:22:46.566 --> 00:22:47.027]  What was your role?
[00:22:47.087 --> 00:22:48.007]  You were pretty high up in the L.A.
[00:22:48.027 --> 00:22:48.548]  Police Department.
[00:22:48.588 --> 00:22:49.929]  No, I was a California Patrol Chief.
[00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:51.310]  I was a state police officer.
[00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:54.172]  And then you were also a police chief somewhere else in Texas, weren't you?
[00:22:54.403 --> 00:22:56.084]  No.
[00:22:56.104 --> 00:22:57.525]  That's another Acevedo, I think.
[00:22:58.245 --> 00:23:06.070]  But the reality is, look, we have a responsibility to keep people alive, and we have a responsibility that when somebody kills somebody out there, seriously injures somebody, to hold them accountable.
[00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:07.551]  And I don't want people to think
[00:23:08.493 --> 00:23:10.394]  You've got to realize where I started my life.
[00:23:10.434 --> 00:23:16.097]  I started my life in a communist dictatorship, and I hope you don't say you like Fidel Castro, because those are fighting words with Cubans, okay?
[00:23:16.717 --> 00:23:18.918]  The reality is... Oh yeah, I'm a known communist.
[00:23:19.098 --> 00:23:19.358]  Are you?
[00:23:19.378 --> 00:23:20.639]  I didn't know that part!
[00:23:21.019 --> 00:23:23.620]  But the reality is... That's a joke.
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:24.801]  I'm a Ron Paul guy.
[00:23:24.821 --> 00:23:25.301]  No, I know.
[00:23:25.601 --> 00:23:28.543]  The reality is, I absolutely respect the Constitution.
[00:23:29.023 --> 00:23:35.406]  We are a nation of laws, and we will always abide by the rules that is set for us by the public.
[00:23:36.474 --> 00:23:37.374]  And by the legislature.
[00:23:37.394 --> 00:23:41.356]  Well, the problem is the legislature tells Rick Perry you're not going to put these toll roads on existing roads.
[00:23:41.376 --> 00:23:42.377]  He just says, I'm going to do it.
[00:23:43.177 --> 00:23:45.998]  Well, that's an issue for the legislature and Rick Perry to deal with.
[00:23:46.578 --> 00:23:48.979]  Okay, let's bring up the big issue then.
[00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:51.260]  You talk about drunk driving.
[00:23:52.341 --> 00:23:53.921]  And I've got hundreds of mainstream articles.
[00:23:53.981 --> 00:23:55.062]  I know you're aware of this.
[00:23:55.942 --> 00:23:56.622]  You keep saying that.
[00:23:57.123 --> 00:23:58.743]  Well, because you're a smart guy.
[00:23:58.843 --> 00:24:01.184]  But I'm saying, if you want me to pull you this up right now, I can.
[00:24:03.049 --> 00:24:04.150]  I'm just saying we document it.
[00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:05.891]  Claims I'm making are not claims, they're facts.
[00:24:05.951 --> 00:24:06.051]  Okay.
[00:24:07.391 --> 00:24:25.201]  Sheriffs, police chiefs, all over the country have said that they pull over a van, say with 15 illegal aliens in it, none of them have IDs, none of them have insurance, some of them are drunk, they pick them up, they take them in, ICE won't pick them up, the judges in the city say, $50 fines, we don't have any ID, we're letting them go.
[00:24:25.501 --> 00:24:29.643]  The famous railway serial killer killed a bunch of people, been going around for years, couldn't be caught.
[00:24:30.004 --> 00:24:32.305]  You talk about tracking things and having accountability.
[00:24:32.625 --> 00:24:39.569]  Citizens are having their plates scanned, face scanned, controlled, police everywhere, children spying on us in the schools.
[00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:45.592]  But then meanwhile, I know for a fact in Austin, Texas, and I've had a bunch of Austin police tell me this, and it happened.
[00:24:45.952 --> 00:24:46.873]  One night I pulled up,
[00:24:48.109 --> 00:24:55.953]  At this office, and I see two police cars and the lights going about a year and a half ago, and I walk up and my IT guy, who's actually a contractor, is in handcuffs.
[00:24:55.993 --> 00:24:57.634]  He goes, oh yeah, my license expired.
[00:24:57.674 --> 00:24:58.974]  I haven't got it renewed.
[00:24:58.994 --> 00:25:01.015]  And they said, yep, we're just having to arrest him.
[00:25:01.476 --> 00:25:04.337]  And I said, and it turned out the cops kind of bowled up when I first pulled up.
[00:25:04.377 --> 00:25:05.678]  And they said, oh, Alex Jones, how you doing?
[00:25:06.338 --> 00:25:07.159]  We're fans of the show.
[00:25:07.199 --> 00:25:08.700]  But then they went ahead and said, no, we've got to arrest him.
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:11.061]  And I said, but if he was an illegal alien, you probably wouldn't.
[00:25:11.081 --> 00:25:12.042]  And he says, you know what?
[00:25:12.102 --> 00:25:14.464]  They just let him go and we're not encouraged to do it.
[00:25:14.484 --> 00:25:16.045]  And Austin's a sanctuary city.
[00:25:17.906 --> 00:25:22.930]  So what do you say to that, claiming drunk drivers, when statistically, you talk about Austin being hard-drinking.
[00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:25.892]  We know folks from south of the border are hard-drinking too, just like Texans.
[00:25:26.499 --> 00:25:32.960]  Well, look, I've been talking about this on Spanish media and on Spanish radio, and it's from the day I got here.
[00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:39.982]  If you commit a crime in this city, if you commit a violation, I don't care if you're legal or illegal, we're going to enforce the law.
[00:25:40.042 --> 00:25:40.982]  That is our job.
[00:25:41.182 --> 00:25:45.443]  Now, this was a year and a half ago, but why did the officers tell me they weren't supposed to arrest them a year and a half ago?
[00:25:45.463 --> 00:25:45.823]  You know what?
[00:25:45.883 --> 00:25:48.763]  Some of it may be their own perception.
[00:25:49.084 --> 00:25:56.345]  The reality is, when we take enforcement action, we base it on the statutes and the ordinances in the city, without regard to socioeconomic standing.
[00:25:56.445 --> 00:25:57.565]  Is this in Sanctuary City?
[00:25:57.945 --> 00:25:58.646]  It's listed as one.
[00:25:59.606 --> 00:26:04.668]  This is not Sanctuary City, because when we book people at the jail, ICE has access to the jail.
[00:26:05.468 --> 00:26:06.248]  They don't come, do they?
[00:26:06.268 --> 00:26:15.711]  What do you do when you don't know who somebody is, and there's been a stabbing, and you've got three witnesses, and it's hard to prosecute, because nobody knows who these people are?
[00:26:15.731 --> 00:26:19.752]  And also, then that victimizes these communities, because they're lawless.
[00:26:19.992 --> 00:26:20.652]  Well, absolutely.
[00:26:22.953 --> 00:26:24.655]  There's two things here that are happening.
[00:26:24.695 --> 00:26:27.757]  First of all, immigration control starts at the border.
[00:26:27.837 --> 00:26:29.178]  You've got to secure your borders.
[00:26:29.258 --> 00:26:36.664]  I think that most major city chiefs, that is actually a policy position of major city chiefs here in the country, is that we've got to secure our borders.
[00:26:37.124 --> 00:26:41.148]  The second part, though, is that we have to be serious about it, because here's the unintended consequence.
[00:26:41.608 --> 00:26:47.253]  If I become, actually it's an unfounded mandate for me to be doing ICE's work or immigration's work.
[00:26:47.813 --> 00:26:48.814]  But here's the problem.
[00:26:49.294 --> 00:26:58.019]  If there is a revolving door where three days after you get them, if we became an arm of immigration, they're going to be right back.
[00:26:58.579 --> 00:27:06.324]  What can happen is that we lose the trust of that community that's going to be here, and we lose witnesses, we lose victims, and we all lose.
[00:27:07.084 --> 00:27:14.609]  I have friends that work for the federal government in California, in Southern California, that used to be frustrated that they'd take people down on the bus
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:20.444]  And the joke was that the people that were deported beat the bus back to downtown L.A.
[00:27:20.484 --> 00:27:22.806]  They also kill police, federal police.
[00:27:23.307 --> 00:27:24.047]  They commit murders.
[00:27:24.107 --> 00:27:26.369]  And Mexico will not extradite back to the U.S.
[00:27:26.409 --> 00:27:27.370]  if there's a death penalty.
[00:27:27.831 --> 00:27:29.792]  So, I mean, this is literally like the Wild West.
[00:27:29.812 --> 00:27:32.194]  You know about the rocket attacks in Nuevo Laredo.
[00:27:32.255 --> 00:27:33.696]  You know about the truck bomb in Dallas.
[00:27:34.036 --> 00:27:36.418]  You know about Los Yetis paramilitary Mexican troops.
[00:27:36.959 --> 00:27:39.281]  And I reported this three years before it hit the mainstream.
[00:27:40.061 --> 00:27:42.243]  are now carrying out operations.
[00:27:42.543 --> 00:27:43.684]  The police are scared of them.
[00:27:44.285 --> 00:27:48.649]  MS-13, I mean, it's... And then meanwhile, my guy's got an expired license.
[00:27:48.669 --> 00:27:49.249]  He's off to jail.
[00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:58.437]  Well, again, our official position here is that if you break the law, if you violate the law, we're going to treat you the same, whether you're legal or illegal, you're going to go to jail.
[00:27:58.457 --> 00:28:02.160]  So what do you do when you pull an illegal alien over who's driving a car and they don't have insurance?
[00:28:03.741 --> 00:28:05.203]  I mean, how do you write them a ticket if you don't know who they are?
[00:28:05.785 --> 00:28:11.389]  Well, if you cannot reasonably identify who a person is, then you take them forthwith and get them identified.
[00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:15.392]  So you are taking people to jail who you don't know who they are?
[00:28:15.553 --> 00:28:20.736]  Our policy allows our officers that if you cannot identify a person, you can go forthwith.
[00:28:20.757 --> 00:28:22.478]  But see, that's their discretion.
[00:28:22.538 --> 00:28:23.559]  You can go forth.
[00:28:24.119 --> 00:28:30.561]  I mean, yeah, but the police are encouraged to go out and write tickets and generate revenue on the almost broke-back city, even though we're a wealthy city.
[00:28:30.881 --> 00:28:34.161]  But meanwhile, you see, I mean, look, let's be honest, Chief.
[00:28:34.542 --> 00:28:36.222]  You know and I know there's a double standard.
[00:28:36.242 --> 00:28:43.624]  There's a double standard to 867 sanctuary cities, and Austin is on the map as one of the worst in the country after L.A., Denver, Chicago.
[00:28:43.844 --> 00:28:51.706]  We've got a Mexican consulate, our mission here, which hands out these Cracker Jack... The consular matricula.
[00:28:51.726 --> 00:28:52.306]  Matricula, yeah.
[00:28:52.646 --> 00:29:00.107]  I mean, I had the leader of the Republican Senate on a few years ago, he in one day himself, went and got four fake IDs from a Mexican consulate.
[00:29:00.831 --> 00:29:13.597]  Well, it is a challenge, but you know, the problem for us as police officers at a local level is policing a community that we know is here and policing a community that, you know, we don't control the borders.
[00:29:13.657 --> 00:29:15.458]  We have to control what's in our city.
[00:29:16.299 --> 00:29:26.464]  And I think some of the frustration is that the reality is the way that you deal with immigration is you dry up jobs, you dry up some of those opportunities, people wouldn't come here illegally.
[00:29:27.879 --> 00:29:30.380]  To me, if you're going to get serious, that's where you start, is with employers.
[00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:31.141]  Oh, I agree.
[00:29:32.982 --> 00:29:38.204]  Plus, just as a citizen, I want people to be able to have entry-level jobs, no matter what color they are.
[00:29:38.605 --> 00:29:40.786]  We've got hundreds of millions of people that want to come here.
[00:29:41.606 --> 00:29:43.547]  And the states are already bankrupt.
[00:29:43.567 --> 00:29:44.188]  The hospitals.
[00:29:45.228 --> 00:29:49.871]  One weekend, I cut my finger off on accident to help some people with their boat out in Lake Travis.
[00:29:49.891 --> 00:29:50.711]  It was flopping around.
[00:29:51.301 --> 00:29:58.303]  And so the ambulance took me down to the city hospital, and there was just rows of illegal aliens in there who had no insurance.
[00:29:58.323 --> 00:29:59.984]  Well, that may be an assumption.
[00:30:00.004 --> 00:30:01.905]  Just because they look Hispanic, how do you know they're illegal aliens?
[00:30:01.925 --> 00:30:02.525]  No, no, I was listening.
[00:30:02.605 --> 00:30:03.405]  I was listening.
[00:30:03.545 --> 00:30:09.807]  I was sitting there with my hand wrapped up with it hanging by a piece of skin, and my dad, who's a physician there, saying he needs to get this attached fast.
[00:30:10.228 --> 00:30:10.668]  I've called him.
[00:30:10.708 --> 00:30:11.228]  He drove down.
[00:30:11.648 --> 00:30:13.509]  And I'm sitting there, but it wasn't just that.
[00:30:13.529 --> 00:30:14.229]  It was poor people.
[00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:25.534]  It was a Sunday full of poor people who were so poor they don't have insurance and then about half of them were, you know, because I was watching, they'd go up and they'd say, do you have insurance?
[00:30:25.554 --> 00:30:26.034]  Do you have ID?
[00:30:26.114 --> 00:30:26.394]  No.
[00:30:26.434 --> 00:30:27.194]  Well, who are you?
[00:30:27.495 --> 00:30:32.777]  And because they knew that they weren't going to have insurance but they needed to provide care, which I'm saying is good, they went right through.
[00:30:33.037 --> 00:30:40.840]  My point is the country is breaking down and we need to not give third world populations special status or it's going to destroy this country.
[00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:42.641]  I'm all for immigrants coming to this nation.
[00:30:42.921 --> 00:30:45.543]  I mean, you were born in Cuba, fleeing communism.
[00:30:45.803 --> 00:30:46.964]  Well, we applied to come here.
[00:30:47.464 --> 00:30:49.606]  No, I know, but I'm all for that's what I'm saying, Chief.
[00:30:49.926 --> 00:30:50.807]  But here's the issue, though.
[00:30:50.827 --> 00:30:52.828]  There are some unintended consequences.
[00:30:52.868 --> 00:30:58.893]  Remember now, the job of immigration enforcement lies primarily with the federal government.
[00:30:58.953 --> 00:30:59.613]  It's their job.
[00:31:00.314 --> 00:31:09.380]  We have people here that keep arguing we shouldn't arrest people that are committing burglaries, we can't keep the burglars, the rapists, all these other folks in jail because there's no jail space.
[00:31:10.261 --> 00:31:11.582]  If ICE isn't going to pick them up,
[00:31:12.697 --> 00:31:13.218]  Thank you.
[00:31:29.375 --> 00:31:32.537]  We lose, potentially, 10 million witnesses to crime.
[00:31:33.037 --> 00:31:46.904]  One of our kids gets kidnapped at the bus stop, and the little old lady that's the child care attendant for somebody that they hired... Now they're afraid to call the local cop, and they might be... The ambulance system actually works, I think you know that.
[00:31:48.064 --> 00:31:50.606]  And the West Coast has had a 100% recovery rate.
[00:31:50.686 --> 00:31:51.826]  It is a great system.
[00:31:51.846 --> 00:31:58.270]  Yeah, but now they're going to use it for flashing, call terrorist tip line, don't water your yard on Tuesdays.
[00:31:58.430 --> 00:32:03.573]  You can't get crazy with that because it waters it down, people lose interest and it loses its effectiveness.
[00:32:03.793 --> 00:32:05.294]  But that's one of the unintended consequences.
[00:32:06.815 --> 00:32:08.896]  Becoming afraid of calling the cops.
[00:32:08.936 --> 00:32:12.258]  The cops aren't going to take enforcement action against somebody the next time they victimize somebody.
[00:32:12.498 --> 00:32:14.199]  It may be you or me or someone else.
[00:32:14.459 --> 00:32:22.263]  So it has to be a comprehensive approach that starts with securing our border, making sure that people can only get jobs if they're here legally or serious about it.
[00:32:22.763 --> 00:32:26.265]  But it really is a federal issue that they've got to be the ones that take the lead on it.
[00:32:26.345 --> 00:32:33.368]  Well, Chief Acevedo, I agree with a lot of what you're saying about how it should be federal, about how it should be enforced against employers.
[00:32:33.868 --> 00:32:37.930]  It's very hypocritical to arrest these immigrants and treat them bad.
[00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:39.850]  And believe me, I know how bad Mexico is.
[00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:42.732]  In Mexico City, 30 million people, half of them living in cardboard boxes.
[00:32:43.112 --> 00:32:43.792]  It's hell on earth.
[00:32:44.152 --> 00:32:51.395]  The problem is this country is like a lifeboat that will pull the boat completely down if we just say unlimited and the crime and then give them a double standard.
[00:32:51.675 --> 00:32:55.757]  And I understand this rationale, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[00:32:56.397 --> 00:33:03.158]  And to just say we have to have this interface with the community and so we have to go with kid gloves.
[00:33:03.598 --> 00:33:07.799]  I'm saying there's not kid gloves with me because I'm seen as the big fat milk cow.
[00:33:07.879 --> 00:33:13.260]  I'm seen as the dumb American driving around in their SUV.
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:14.540]  Trust me, you're not seen as a dumb guy.
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:18.221]  You're seen as a very bright, articulate, well-informed individual.
[00:33:18.241 --> 00:33:19.741]  But I'm talking about the citizens.
[00:33:20.041 --> 00:33:23.302]  Citizens are seen as the milk cow to be sucked off of.
[00:33:23.382 --> 00:33:25.565]  Well, but here's the issue.
[00:33:26.687 --> 00:33:28.309]  Plain devil's advocate to your position.
[00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:38.583]  If I get involved and just start asking people for your papers solely for the reason to see if they're here legally or not, and they get deported and three days later they're back,
[00:33:40.447 --> 00:33:46.333]  And now that same person in the future sees a crime as a victim of crime and they will no longer want to cooperate with me.
[00:33:46.794 --> 00:33:48.976]  How has public safety been enhanced?
[00:33:49.076 --> 00:33:49.917]  Well, I want to be clear.
[00:33:50.497 --> 00:33:59.346]  I think there should be an amnesty in that if someone comes in to report a crime, it's policy and it's advertised that if you come in seeing a stabbing or a shooting or a robbery... That's a new visa.
[00:33:59.386 --> 00:34:00.968]  That's actually in law now.
[00:34:03.499 --> 00:34:17.786]  The Austin cops have told me, and I've sat around at bars and restaurants with them, I've got friends that are cops, I've worked out with cops, and they go, yeah, we're basically told and encouraged, we get in trouble, we get, you know, start getting demerits for other issues if we drag in a bunch of illegal aliens, and it's wrong, it's wrong!
[00:34:18.426 --> 00:34:21.568]  But you need to know something about cop culture.
[00:34:22.068 --> 00:34:30.633]  Cops sometimes talk out of school a lot, where they'll start telling you, and they're talking stories, they're talking shop, and you gotta take sometimes... Oh, now we can't believe the cops!
[00:34:31.593 --> 00:34:38.177]  You're mentioning bars, you're mentioning drinks, you know, next thing you know they got the biggest fish that they caught when they went fishing.
[00:34:38.517 --> 00:34:44.941]  You gotta take it with a little grain of salt when you're telling stories because there's a lot of urban legends and myths and everything else that goes into it.
[00:34:44.961 --> 00:34:47.983]  Police Chief R. Day Cervato, he is a slick one ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:48.043 --> 00:34:48.884]  What are you talking about?
[00:34:49.304 --> 00:35:04.503]  But the reality is, we will not, when my cop makes an unlawful arrest, I don't care if the person is legal or illegal, our position is we expect them to take the proper enforcement action, irregardless of the person's status.
[00:35:05.043 --> 00:35:06.105]  And that's the best I can do.
[00:35:06.502 --> 00:35:08.904]  Okay, so police listening right now, and they listen to this show.
[00:35:08.925 --> 00:35:09.545]  We're on 90.1, 1330, 590.
[00:35:09.625 --> 00:35:11.787]  We're going to re-air this.
[00:35:12.768 --> 00:35:13.589]  They're hearing you.
[00:35:13.729 --> 00:35:17.813]  They pull somebody over, and there's beer cans in the back.
[00:35:17.934 --> 00:35:19.595]  There's no ID, no insurance.
[00:35:19.655 --> 00:35:20.056]  What happens?
[00:35:20.814 --> 00:35:24.676]  You take the appropriate enforcement action, regardless of what they're... But what is that?
[00:35:24.696 --> 00:35:25.736]  You're saying you leave it up to them.
[00:35:28.177 --> 00:35:30.878]  If it's an offense where it's a ticket, you write a ticket.
[00:35:30.978 --> 00:35:33.339]  If it's an offense where they're supposed to go to jail, you take them to jail.
[00:35:33.359 --> 00:35:34.800]  But how do you write a ticket if you don't know who they are?
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:36.841]  They arrested my guy because he didn't have an ID.
[00:35:37.001 --> 00:35:40.282]  If you don't know who they are and you can't identify them, there's tactics.
[00:35:40.342 --> 00:35:44.364]  I'm not going to give you the tactics on how to... People can't get their story straight half the time.
[00:35:44.424 --> 00:35:46.825]  There's ways to get information and identify people.
[00:35:47.525 --> 00:35:48.406]  Stay there, sir.
[00:35:48.446 --> 00:35:50.648]  Final segment coming up with the Austin Police Chief.
[00:35:50.668 --> 00:35:51.809]  This has been great.
[00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:52.789]  Stay with us.
[00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:55.051]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:35:55.191 --> 00:36:01.877]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:36:02.157 --> 00:36:10.323]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:36:10.563 --> 00:36:16.268]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:36:16.468 --> 00:36:18.232]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:36:18.292 --> 00:36:20.457]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:36:20.477 --> 00:36:24.487]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:36:26.738 --> 00:36:28.599]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:36:56.633 --> 00:36:59.335]  I feel I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:36:59.435 --> 00:37:07.240]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[00:37:26.172 --> 00:37:31.817]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:37:31.857 --> 00:37:35.020]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:37.942]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:37:38.002 --> 00:37:41.625]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:56.086]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:37:59.944 --> 00:38:03.786]  How dare you?
[00:38:04.026 --> 00:38:07.448]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:38:07.608 --> 00:38:09.989]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:38:10.109 --> 00:38:16.772]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of the... Truth Rises.

[00:38:21.915 --> 00:38:24.416]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:38:25.111 --> 00:38:27.313]  Have you heard about American Free Press?
[00:38:27.973 --> 00:38:29.194]  American Free Press.
[00:38:29.594 --> 00:38:33.477]  The only national newspaper that endorsed Ron Paul for president.
[00:38:34.098 --> 00:38:35.319]  American Free Press.
[00:38:35.819 --> 00:38:38.221]  Written by patriots, for patriots.
[00:38:38.821 --> 00:38:41.023]  Standing firm for our Constitution.
[00:38:41.603 --> 00:38:44.025]  Standing firm against the New World Order.
[00:38:44.606 --> 00:38:46.267]  Hammering the enemies of freedom.
[00:38:46.867 --> 00:38:49.149]  Exposing the intrigues of the global elite.
[00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:57.497]  American Free Press hits the Bilderbergers and Trilateralists and the whole Council on Foreign Relations gang head-on.
[00:38:57.977 --> 00:39:00.260]  Here's your chance to catch up with the news.
[00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:10.109]  Police Chief Art Acevedo is our guest for this segment and one more.
[00:39:11.834 --> 00:39:13.876]  We're really honored to have him with us.
[00:39:14.497 --> 00:39:16.339]  During the break we were having a really animated discussion.
[00:39:16.399 --> 00:39:20.363]  I said, hey, what I don't want is what you grew up in, in Cuba, what you fought to leave.
[00:39:20.723 --> 00:39:22.866]  And we're glad to have people who love freedom in this country.
[00:39:23.206 --> 00:39:24.687]  And our arms are totally open to that.
[00:39:24.748 --> 00:39:27.911]  And we need people that have experienced tyranny so they can fight against it here.
[00:39:27.951 --> 00:39:34.378]  But having children spy on their parents, it always starts out, oh, for drugs, or if you're being abused, or if you're this or you're that.
[00:39:34.778 --> 00:39:36.199]  I mean, I've gone and I've seen the abuses.
[00:39:36.259 --> 00:39:41.701]  I've seen CPS snatch people's babies and then lie on the forums because I was there and take them for adoption.
[00:39:42.062 --> 00:39:49.505]  I know that the system's gotten predatory and I'm sure you're a nice guy and a good guy and a smart guy and you see the good in what's happening.
[00:39:49.985 --> 00:39:55.048]  I see a lot of the bad and I know that we're becoming more like a Cuba, more like a Soviet Union, more like
[00:39:55.968 --> 00:40:00.811]  East Germany, with the spying, the control, all of this, and it isn't for our security.
[00:40:01.211 --> 00:40:03.512]  I read the RAND Corporation documents.
[00:40:03.632 --> 00:40:05.093]  I know how they're federalizing departments.
[00:40:05.453 --> 00:40:06.554]  I know the larger plan.
[00:40:06.574 --> 00:40:12.197]  They've got a lot of guys like you, who are well-meaning, plus their butts, trying to protect people, and a lot of good's done.
[00:40:12.417 --> 00:40:14.178]  But overall, the federal state's growing.
[00:40:14.398 --> 00:40:15.219]  The control's growing.
[00:40:15.419 --> 00:40:22.282]  So, I'd like you to speak to that, Chief, and we appreciate you graciously coming in and being interrogated.
[00:40:23.883 --> 00:40:25.845]  Your allegiance stands with the state and the city, doesn't it?
[00:40:26.125 --> 00:40:28.568]  I mean, your allegiance stands with the Bill of Rights Constitution?
[00:40:29.208 --> 00:40:29.649]  Absolutely.
[00:40:29.669 --> 00:40:44.243]  That being that when we take our oath of office, we take an oath to the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of Texas, and my job is really, my number one concern is the welfare and the safety of the people that live, visit, and work in Austin.
[00:40:44.604 --> 00:40:45.405]  That's the bottom line.
[00:40:46.606 --> 00:40:47.166]  Absolutely.
[00:40:48.619 --> 00:40:54.784]  I mean, expanding on that though, we were privately talking about, you know, you're saying you don't want America to be a police state, you're saying you don't want it to be like Cuba.
[00:40:54.824 --> 00:40:56.465]  I don't want to paraphrase what you were saying.
[00:40:56.485 --> 00:40:57.245]  Do you want to elaborate?
[00:40:57.265 --> 00:41:03.510]  Well, I think that you have to, you don't ever want to be in a situation where, in Cuba, they want to know what your parents were thinking.
[00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.991]  What is their train of thought?
[00:41:05.011 --> 00:41:06.552]  Do they speak out against the government?
[00:41:06.612 --> 00:41:14.358]  We never want to be in that kind of place because, my father used to tell us when we got to this country, from here to the moon, there's no better place on earth and I would hope that... Now look at you now!
[00:41:14.818 --> 00:41:16.598]  Well, and you know, that's why I love this country.
[00:41:16.638 --> 00:41:17.879]  I mean, it's the best country.
[00:41:18.219 --> 00:41:22.080]  With all of our wards and everything, there's no other place I'd rather live than the United States of America.
[00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:27.041]  It's the greatest place on earth, and I'm hoping to... I agree, but I want to defend what it is.
[00:41:27.081 --> 00:41:41.924]  I mean, America is the Bill of Rights, Constitution, Declaration of Independence, and, you know, we're having our liberties taken, and there's always these good reasons, there's always these excuses, you know, there's always... I was talking to you during the break about the Tenth Amendment, and you were saying, well, the Civil War decided that.
[00:41:42.384 --> 00:41:46.946]  Well, yeah, and then Reconstruction decided that, but I mean, is there no end to the federal power?
[00:41:47.546 --> 00:41:50.648]  Well, you know, again, you're talking about the police chief here in Austin, Texas.
[00:41:50.728 --> 00:41:53.409]  I try to keep my focus on my local issues.
[00:41:54.149 --> 00:42:08.156]  I don't have anybody in the federal government dictating to me how to police this city, and the bottom line is that I work for the city leaders and for the people of the city of Austin, and my allegiance is obviously to my city and my country.
[00:42:09.574 --> 00:42:17.277]  One of them was a huge terror attack somewhere in the United States and they said that we have to implement PDD 51, basically making the president a dictator.
[00:42:18.158 --> 00:42:26.361]  What would you do then if they told you, you know, gave you a list, and they have these, it's been in the Houston Chronicle now, of 3,000 Austinites to be picked up and Alex Jones is on there.
[00:42:26.681 --> 00:42:31.243]  And there's no judge, no jury, no indictment, no grand jury, it's just go pick up Alex Jones.
[00:42:31.443 --> 00:42:33.964]  We'd say Alex Jones, we know him, we're going to vouch for him.
[00:42:34.685 --> 00:42:38.246]  But the reality is we'll cross that bridge when we get there.
[00:42:38.987 --> 00:42:40.728]  You'll cross the bridge to follow up?
[00:42:40.748 --> 00:42:47.171]  No, to figure out if it's a lawful order and we'll make that decision based on what we know to be right.
[00:42:47.191 --> 00:42:49.652]  I mean, we got the city to throw out the Patriot Act here locally.
[00:42:50.612 --> 00:42:51.753]  You know, to say that we oppose it.
[00:42:51.893 --> 00:43:03.498]  So, the bottom line is just remember, we are a local police department, we are a separate entity, and we will operate based upon what our own city statutes are and our requirements are.
[00:43:05.138 --> 00:43:13.402]  But we know that they've trained the police to drive the buses and pick up people during riots, and we know they have the emergency center out at the old airport, the overflow center.
[00:43:13.622 --> 00:43:15.183]  Is that still there with the bolts and chains on the floor?
[00:43:16.047 --> 00:43:17.228]  I haven't seen it since I've been here.
[00:43:17.388 --> 00:43:18.408]  I mean, are you aware of that?
[00:43:18.989 --> 00:43:20.249]  There's a Bolton change where?
[00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:22.771]  The little FEMA camp they've got at the old Mueller Airport.
[00:43:23.011 --> 00:43:23.751]  I haven't seen it, no.
[00:43:23.771 --> 00:43:24.552]  You went to Poland?
[00:43:24.732 --> 00:43:27.734]  But you know what, the old airport, I think that's pretty much been torn down.
[00:43:27.774 --> 00:43:28.714]  Privatized, yeah.
[00:43:28.754 --> 00:43:29.855]  I'll tell you what, stay there.
[00:43:29.935 --> 00:43:30.635]  One minute break, Chief.
[00:43:30.775 --> 00:43:34.558]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:43:34.618 --> 00:43:35.158]  I'm a local girl.

[00:43:41.022 --> 00:43:45.684]  During riots, and we know they have the emergency center out at the old airport, the overflow center.
[00:43:45.904 --> 00:43:47.164]  Is that still there with the Bolton Chain?

[00:44:45.561 --> 00:44:47.462]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:44:47.942 --> 00:44:50.864]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:45:09.613 --> 00:45:13.315]  Well, I have been interrogating him and I'd like to give him the last five minutes
[00:45:15.313 --> 00:45:19.716]  Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo to talk about whatever he thinks is most important.
[00:45:19.736 --> 00:45:21.517]  To get out any websites or any points he's making.
[00:45:21.737 --> 00:45:23.698]  I would like to see other police chiefs across the country.
[00:45:23.938 --> 00:45:29.621]  We're on in Chicago, LA, San Diego, Kansas City, other places.
[00:45:29.661 --> 00:45:31.502]  If you want to come on this show, you are welcome.
[00:45:32.023 --> 00:45:41.988]  We'd love to hear from you here as well, because one thing that will fight tyranny is the people truly being involved in their government and being friends with the police, but not in a spy way, but in the way you're doing it.
[00:45:42.589 --> 00:45:44.410]  And so it humanizes both sides.
[00:45:45.049 --> 00:45:55.358]  Well, yeah, and I think familiarity breeds trust and respect, and the reality is at least we know each other's positions and we don't have to agree on everything, but we can agree to disagree.
[00:45:55.378 --> 00:45:57.240]  So please don't take me to the FEMA camp.
[00:45:58.461 --> 00:45:59.922]  No, we have a special lock-up for you.
[00:45:59.942 --> 00:46:00.323]  I'm kidding.
[00:46:01.424 --> 00:46:03.446]  Trust me, we don't have any black helicopters following you around.
[00:46:03.646 --> 00:46:05.427]  I only have one helicopter, for God's sakes.
[00:46:05.467 --> 00:46:06.308]  I'm trying to get a second.
[00:46:07.129 --> 00:46:08.971]  But the reality is... I know, it buzzes my house daily.
[00:46:10.351 --> 00:46:12.833]  That must be Tank, one of our guys with a good sense of humor.
[00:46:13.073 --> 00:46:15.094]  The reality is we have a great police department here in Austin.
[00:46:15.134 --> 00:46:16.095]  We live in a great city.
[00:46:16.715 --> 00:46:23.820]  Our goal, though, is that we don't want to be naive to think that things can't worsen for us in terms of crime if we don't stay on top of it.
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:25.561]  We want to be proactive.
[00:46:25.581 --> 00:46:26.542]  We want to be aggressive.
[00:46:27.122 --> 00:46:28.864]  But we want to be respectful of people's rights.
[00:46:29.004 --> 00:46:33.847]  And most importantly, we want to make sure that everybody's treated the same and equally that lives here.
[00:46:34.327 --> 00:46:37.549]  But the last thing I want to say is something I'm very proud of and make the public aware of.
[00:46:37.689 --> 00:46:40.011]  We have now brought back our Police Activities League.
[00:46:40.612 --> 00:46:41.653]  We're good to go.
[00:46:54.537 --> 00:46:56.198]  No, our society is unraveling.
[00:46:57.359 --> 00:46:59.741]  And it starts with kids not graduating from school.
[00:47:00.122 --> 00:47:01.503]  We're doing our little share here.
[00:47:01.903 --> 00:47:06.988]  I would hope that your listeners would know that we're having a Police Activities League lock-up towards the end of the month here.
[00:47:07.008 --> 00:47:16.856]  They can go to our website at the Police Department and please support our Explorer program where kids can learn about being police officers, what that field is like.
[00:47:17.116 --> 00:47:18.878]  They can learn how to take me to a FEMA camp.
[00:47:19.383 --> 00:47:20.884]  We're not taking you to a FEMA camp.
[00:47:20.924 --> 00:47:22.845]  You'd be bored!
[00:47:22.866 --> 00:47:25.347]  You just said that the cops like to listen to you, and I know I've listened to you.
[00:47:25.367 --> 00:47:25.848]  I'm joking!
[00:47:25.868 --> 00:47:26.528]  What do we do with you?
[00:47:26.748 --> 00:47:29.730]  But the reality is, we have got to invest in kids, Alex.
[00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:31.452]  You know that the kids are our future.
[00:47:31.872 --> 00:47:47.063]  We've got a lot of kids that their parents are working, nobody's ever around, they have no adult supervision, and in the Austin Police Department, through our Explorer Program and our Police Activities League, we want to make a difference in kids' lives, and I hope your listeners will contact us to help donate funds, and more importantly, maybe even help volunteer.
[00:47:47.887 --> 00:47:54.492]  And then, so you want my listeners, basically because they'll be spying on you, you know that, to come in and get involved with the department?
[00:47:55.193 --> 00:47:56.234]  Look, we have nothing to hide.
[00:47:56.474 --> 00:47:57.174]  Well, I'll say this.
[00:47:57.515 --> 00:47:59.336]  That is the answer to take this government back.
[00:47:59.616 --> 00:48:05.981]  We have 60% on average people coming out for presidential elections, but 8% local elections nationally on average.
[00:48:06.402 --> 00:48:10.044]  We need to get that up to 80% locally, and if good people get involved in government,
[00:48:10.885 --> 00:48:15.107]  We're going to end up having the police chiefs, and the mayors, and the sheriffs, and then it's going to be our government.
[00:48:15.827 --> 00:48:21.209]  We have handed over our responsibility, turned it over to the feds, and I've told the listeners, that is the responsibility.
[00:48:21.449 --> 00:48:26.652]  If the people get involved and you know you're a good person, then that'll block the control freaks that are trying to get involved in government.
[00:48:26.872 --> 00:48:30.853]  We've let all the control freaks take over the government.
[00:48:31.093 --> 00:48:33.274]  You're starting to talk Texas there for a minute, with letting.
[00:48:33.914 --> 00:48:34.635]  But look, listen to this.
[00:48:34.655 --> 00:48:34.975]  Fixing.
[00:48:35.095 --> 00:48:35.575]  Yeah, fixing.
[00:48:35.595 --> 00:48:36.876]  We're going to fix the fixing things.
[00:48:37.156 --> 00:48:39.377]  Just remember, this is my perspective about my role.
[00:48:40.337 --> 00:48:45.802]  Ultimately, Matt, whatever happens in this city that impacts public safety, the federal government isn't going to answer to that.
[00:48:46.562 --> 00:48:47.903]  The state isn't going to answer to that.
[00:48:48.204 --> 00:48:54.369]  The Chief of Police of Austin, Texas is going to answer to Austinites because I work for them and there is no excuse.
[00:48:54.509 --> 00:48:55.850]  We have to stand on top of issues.
[00:48:56.170 --> 00:48:57.851]  But know this, we are here to serve.
[00:48:58.212 --> 00:48:59.313]  We have nothing to hide.
[00:48:59.633 --> 00:49:03.296]  We're a transparent organization and we're not afraid to answer the tough questions.
[00:49:03.316 --> 00:49:05.378]  Well, I have said this, things have changed since you've been here.
[00:49:05.398 --> 00:49:06.619]  We're seeing changes everywhere.
[00:49:07.239 --> 00:49:12.604]  But I just want you to realize, those governing the federal government do not have the same altruistic goals of you, I will assure you.
[00:49:13.124 --> 00:49:16.688]  I mean, look at all the chemical and biological and radiological testing they've done on the American people.
[00:49:16.908 --> 00:49:18.289]  Do you know about Tuskegee and all that?
[00:49:18.309 --> 00:49:19.090]  Yeah, I've been worried about that.
[00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:23.454]  I mean, the point is, let's stop completely trusting government as well, let's get involved in government.
[00:49:23.494 --> 00:49:30.160]  I want to skip this three minute break, so we have three more minutes with the Chief for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, InfoWars.com listeners.
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:32.541]  Well, we're going to go ahead and go live during the break.
[00:49:32.741 --> 00:49:37.142]  For the AM and FM affiliates, we say bye to Chief Art Acevedo.
[00:49:37.542 --> 00:49:43.905]  Right now, we'll be back with Pastor Chuck Baldwin running for president of the Constitution Party on the other side of this break.
[00:49:43.945 --> 00:49:50.787]  But for those behind the scenes, we'll have three minutes left with Art Acevedo, the Austin Police Chief, who certainly is changing things.
[00:49:52.603 --> 00:49:54.144]  I'm September 11th, 2001.
[00:50:10.325 --> 00:50:18.074]  In the time we've got to close, I just want to pick your brain about this, because I looked it up and found out that police are dialing into Nexus, Lexus databases and these threat databases.
[00:50:19.195 --> 00:50:27.544]  My dad, I sold him one of my cars, and he was driving back from our East Texas ranch a few weeks ago at night at about 10 o'clock.
[00:50:27.885 --> 00:50:31.208]  He gets pulled over and the cops wait back and they come over and they say, you're not Alex Jones.
[00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:44.044]  And this came up as Handle With Care, and I heard two legislatures ago, four years ago, that they wanted a database of you said things about police, what your view was of police.
[00:50:44.624 --> 00:50:46.226]  The legislature almost passed that.
[00:50:46.387 --> 00:50:47.688]  A, were you aware of stuff like that?
[00:50:47.988 --> 00:50:49.811]  And B, do you know what database I'm in?
[00:50:50.882 --> 00:50:53.604]  I've been a cop for 22 years.
[00:50:53.644 --> 00:50:54.425]  I'll be real honest with you.
[00:50:54.545 --> 00:50:59.689]  I have never had a database that, I haven't encountered that database yet.
[00:50:59.729 --> 00:51:01.070]  I mean, does it exist?
[00:51:01.751 --> 00:51:02.732]  To my knowledge, it doesn't.
[00:51:03.933 --> 00:51:09.637]  But the reality is, we here in Austin, our activists are actually pretty peaceful activists.
[00:51:10.438 --> 00:51:15.822]  I don't think that anybody's ever died from wards, unless you've incited riots or something, getting people to kill people.
[00:51:15.882 --> 00:51:16.763]  We don't want that.
[00:51:17.023 --> 00:51:19.905]  We definitely don't want that.
[00:51:20.545 --> 00:51:35.994]  I don't know if you know this, but our crowd control team, the Darth Vader office, just remember, if it looks tough and at least we can get people to demonstrate, exercise their First Amendment rights without getting violent,
[00:51:36.574 --> 00:51:37.436]  I think we've won.
[00:51:37.576 --> 00:51:41.982]  I mean, their organizational model is protect the first.
[00:51:42.223 --> 00:51:42.924]  And we believe that.
[00:51:42.944 --> 00:51:43.885]  Well, I'll tell you this.
[00:51:44.146 --> 00:51:45.868]  We know you have intelligence units.
[00:51:46.349 --> 00:51:50.135]  About seven, eight years ago, they were having the big meeting.
[00:51:51.776 --> 00:51:54.417]  For the Forbes Fortune 500 here in town at the Four Seasons.
[00:51:54.778 --> 00:51:58.960]  We were down at the Capitol for the protest and there were big cops dressed up like anarchists stirring up trouble.
[00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:01.341]  Are you going to have any provocateuring here while you're here?
[00:52:01.461 --> 00:52:02.241]  No.
[00:52:02.281 --> 00:52:04.122]  Look, my job is to protect people.
[00:52:04.582 --> 00:52:05.883]  Here's what I just want you to keep an eye on.
[00:52:05.903 --> 00:52:07.164]  So you're changing those things.
[00:52:07.264 --> 00:52:07.964]  Well, listen.
[00:52:08.224 --> 00:52:09.745]  You know you've got provocateurs.
[00:52:09.965 --> 00:52:12.266]  If I catch them, they won't be cops much longer.
[00:52:13.487 --> 00:52:14.427]  The reality is this.
[00:52:14.627 --> 00:52:15.608]  Fidel did stuff like that.
[00:52:15.988 --> 00:52:16.528]  Well, yeah, he did.
[00:52:16.548 --> 00:52:18.349]  I hope the guy's dead.
[00:52:18.389 --> 00:52:19.010]  I'm hoping.
[00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:21.951]  I wake up every morning, that's what, as a Cuban, the first thing is, has he died yet?
[00:52:21.971 --> 00:52:23.512]  They say he's holding on by his toenails.
[00:52:23.632 --> 00:52:27.214]  Oh, I think they have, remember Weekend at Bernie's?
[00:52:27.254 --> 00:52:28.094]  I think that's the character.
[00:52:28.114 --> 00:52:29.255]  I think he's been dead for about a year.
[00:52:29.675 --> 00:52:30.235]  Hopefully he is.
[00:52:30.635 --> 00:52:32.957]  But the reality is, our primary
[00:52:33.837 --> 00:52:41.479]  Focus and mission when we're trying to find out what's going on with with a with a Demonstration is not to stop the demonstration.
[00:52:42.019 --> 00:52:55.243]  It's not to prohibit you or get in your way from exercising first-amendment rights It's to make sure we don't have somebody come in get in the middle of a bunch of peaceful Protesters and next thing you know they start throwing things at the cops and and things get ugly.
[00:52:55.343 --> 00:52:58.304]  We're coming back to the main transmission We'll we'll close it out here.
[00:52:58.324 --> 00:52:58.904]  Do you have Baldwin?
[00:52:59.284 --> 00:52:59.846]  He's all set.
[00:52:59.926 --> 00:53:04.480]  Okay, I want you to play a three minute CNN clip about the vaccines killing kids so I can say bye to the Chief.
[00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:04.861]  Here we go.
[00:53:04.901 --> 00:53:05.101]  Okay.
[00:53:06.237 --> 00:53:08.999]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:53:09.579 --> 00:53:13.661]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:53:14.162 --> 00:53:18.804]  Okay, I'm going to say bye to Police Chief of Austin, Texas, Art Acevedo.
[00:53:18.844 --> 00:53:23.347]  We were just talking about police and provocateur actions, which have now been confirmed mainstream news in Canada.
[00:53:23.827 --> 00:53:25.328]  In Seattle, they hired police.
[00:53:25.368 --> 00:53:28.210]  They had feds dressed up like anarchists, attacked police.
[00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:30.731]  The cops didn't know to then stage that event.
[00:53:30.771 --> 00:53:32.012]  He's saying he's not going to have that
[00:53:32.673 --> 00:53:33.273]  In Austin.
[00:53:33.554 --> 00:53:35.396]  Just know the Fed boys are masters of that.
[00:53:35.877 --> 00:53:38.100]  And again, we just want to thank you for your honesty and your time.
[00:53:38.421 --> 00:53:43.708]  And I don't want to take any more of your time so you know the next time you come in I won't twist your arm into, you know, 50 minutes again.
[00:53:43.748 --> 00:53:44.810]  But thank you, sir.
[00:53:44.830 --> 00:53:45.691]  Hey, my pleasure.
[00:53:45.751 --> 00:53:47.534]  And if you need anything or have any questions, give us a call.
[00:53:47.694 --> 00:53:48.054]  Thank you.
[00:53:48.094 --> 00:53:55.561]  That is the Austin Police Chief leaving us, and we're going to go ahead and play the CNN piece about the HPV shots killing people that your young girls are taking.
[00:53:55.581 --> 00:53:57.863]  We told you a year ago it was killing you, now here it is on CNN.
[00:53:58.103 --> 00:54:06.270]  We know how to read the drug reports, you know, off their own website, and we have doctors and scientists and epidemiologists on, so here's a little three-minute clip on that.
[00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:12.092]  And then, John, come in with the other clip with Walter Cronkite saying he loves the devil.
[00:54:12.432 --> 00:54:14.993]  And then we'll, yeah, it's Walter Cronkite says he's a Satan worshipper.
[00:54:15.013 --> 00:54:15.713]  I'm not kidding.
[00:54:15.733 --> 00:54:17.214]  We're going to go ahead and play Who the Feds Are.
[00:54:17.574 --> 00:54:18.514]  And then, I'm not kidding, Chief.
[00:54:19.014 --> 00:54:19.795]  You can listen to it right now.
[00:54:19.855 --> 00:54:22.416]  And then we're going to go to the presidential candidate, Chuck Baldwin.
[00:54:22.436 --> 00:54:22.816]  Here we go.
[00:54:25.177 --> 00:54:28.818]  Taqueria Williams doesn't get to act like a kid anymore.
[00:54:29.118 --> 00:54:30.899]  She's just too tired.
[00:54:31.779 --> 00:54:33.820]  It kind of hurts.
[00:54:36.090 --> 00:54:37.291]  I used to do a lot.
[00:54:39.893 --> 00:54:49.881]  But Taqueria's mother says everything changed last December after her daughter received Gardasil, a vaccine that prevents 70% of cervical cancer.
[00:54:50.142 --> 00:54:51.263]  She's never been sick.
[00:54:51.303 --> 00:54:52.804]  She's never been in a hospital.
[00:54:53.384 --> 00:54:53.845]  Nothing.
[00:54:54.705 --> 00:54:55.946]  Until the Gardasil shot.
[00:54:57.227 --> 00:55:03.933]  Two months after getting the shot, Taqueria says she got a rash on her face and arms, leaving these scars.
[00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:10.143]  She had swelling all over, pain in her joints, and poor circulation in her fingertips.
[00:55:10.843 --> 00:55:23.688]  Her doctor told us she now suffers from an autoimmune disease and says it is possible the Gardasil triggered her illness, though she made it clear the cause cannot be proven.
[00:55:24.529 --> 00:55:29.771]  According to a federal tracking system called VAERS, there have been 9,749 adverse reactions following the vaccination.
[00:55:34.744 --> 00:55:37.146]  And 21 reported deaths since 2006.
[00:55:38.187 --> 00:55:40.648]  I chose to get my daughter vaccinated.
[00:55:41.109 --> 00:55:45.472]  But Merck, Gardasil's maker, points out these are anecdotal cases.
[00:55:45.972 --> 00:55:53.938]  In a statement, company officials say it, quote, does not necessarily mean that the vaccine caused or contributed to the event.
[00:55:54.688 --> 00:56:05.734]  An official with the Centers for Disease Control says VAERS does not provide enough information for researchers to prove whether Gardasil caused any of the reported side effects.
[00:56:05.894 --> 00:56:09.816]  We want to have better data to reassure people.
[00:56:10.456 --> 00:56:21.462]  But again, the patterns and number of serious events looked at in VAERS do not suggest any increase in risk.
[00:56:21.762 --> 00:56:23.083]  Well, the CDC believes
[00:56:25.436 --> 00:56:39.579]  We are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy to get people actually to love their servitude.
[00:56:40.179 --> 00:56:49.181]  People can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which, by any decent standard, they ought not to enjoy.
[00:56:49.201 --> 00:56:51.541]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[00:57:00.896 --> 00:57:02.679]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[00:57:06.024 --> 00:57:08.949]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[00:57:09.210 --> 00:57:11.413]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[00:57:11.534 --> 00:57:14.018]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[00:57:16.167 --> 00:57:22.149]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatric.
[00:57:22.509 --> 00:57:29.291]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[00:57:29.411 --> 00:57:34.412]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay, but could it also cause cancer?
[00:57:34.572 --> 00:57:37.273]  Turns out the government had the right, under U.S.
[00:57:37.353 --> 00:57:41.534]  law, to conduct secret testing on the American public under specific conditions.
[00:57:41.634 --> 00:57:44.595]  We have to work the dark side, or we're gonna spend time in the shadows.
[00:57:45.922 --> 00:57:49.790]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil.
[00:57:49.971 --> 00:57:50.712]  Well, join me.
[00:57:51.294 --> 00:57:53.318]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan.
