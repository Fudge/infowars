[00:00:05.456 --> 00:00:10.299]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:11.879]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:13.420]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.622]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.622 --> 00:00:26.947]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.947 --> 00:00:28.268]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:28.268 --> 00:00:32.190]  Welcome and thank you for joining us for this live edition.
[00:00:34.145 --> 00:00:38.667]  Of Real Talk Radio.
[00:00:38.667 --> 00:00:41.948]  It is already the middle of the week.
[00:00:41.948 --> 00:00:44.588]  Hard to believe that.
[00:00:44.588 --> 00:00:50.730]  We have a surprise guest joining us later in the broadcast in studio.
[00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.952]  I'll just leave it at that at one o'clock today.
[00:00:55.952 --> 00:00:58.673]  Surprise guest in studio today.
[00:00:58.673 --> 00:01:00.193]  I will just leave it at that.
[00:01:00.193 --> 00:01:01.474]  And then in the
[00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:15.066]  Fourth hour, we have presidential candidate on the Constitution Party popping in for a 30-minute visit, Pastor Chuck Baldwin, coming on in about three hours from now.
[00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:22.632]  But we do have a surprise guest coming up in about an hour and 58 minutes in studio.
[00:01:22.632 --> 00:01:25.155]  And it should be interesting and very lively.
[00:01:25.155 --> 00:01:30.039]  I'll just leave it at that, and you can find out when that takes place in two hours.
[00:01:33.095 --> 00:01:40.417]  A lot of important news to cover in this live edition today.
[00:01:40.417 --> 00:01:46.759]  Largest naval deployment since 1991 heads for the Persian Gulf.
[00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:48.819]  We're breaking that down.
[00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:54.821]  Ceasefire in Georgia dashes neocon predictions of Russian expansion in the region.
[00:01:54.821 --> 00:01:58.502]  Obama advisor, Zbigniew Brzezinski, compares Putin to Hitler.
[00:01:58.502 --> 00:01:59.382]  That's the London Guardian.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:08.763]  EU may send peacekeepers to enforce ceasefire in South Ossetia, whether Russia likes it or not.
[00:02:08.763 --> 00:02:16.206]  Russia's massive naval force opposite Georgia's third sensitive region, Ajaria.
[00:02:16.206 --> 00:02:21.108]  Oil rises for the first time in four days as dollar weakens.
[00:02:21.108 --> 00:02:26.950]  As much as I'd love to believe people that are saying the dollar's going to come back up, I've seen this over and over again the last six, seven years.
[00:02:28.027 --> 00:02:37.934]  The dollar goes down 3 or 4 cents, then it goes up a penny, then it goes down 3 or 4 cents, then it goes up a penny, or it goes up a penny or two, and it goes down 5 cents.
[00:02:37.934 --> 00:02:41.736]  But on the long-term graph, it's going straight down.
[00:02:41.736 --> 00:02:55.886]  And they tell you that the dollar is going to come back, and they tell you that oil prices are going to go down, and I've been predicting all summer that at the end of the summer, oil prices would go down, but then hit an all-time high yet again next
[00:02:57.097 --> 00:02:57.657]  Summer.
[00:02:57.657 --> 00:03:01.339]  That's what it's been doing for the last six plus years.
[00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:02.780]  Every year.
[00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:10.883]  And the basic market fundamentals show the dollar is going down the crapper, as they say.
[00:03:10.883 --> 00:03:17.006]  I hope that something can change that, but the laws of the market say it won't.
[00:03:17.006 --> 00:03:20.428]  And big investment firms and sovereign wealth firms
[00:03:21.488 --> 00:03:24.391]  Funds are moving out of the dollar, out of the United States.
[00:03:24.391 --> 00:03:26.533]  So, there's the facts there.
[00:03:26.533 --> 00:03:30.677]  Oil rises for the first time in four days as the dollar weakens.
[00:03:30.677 --> 00:03:33.159]  FCC Commissioner, we have a video clip of this.
[00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:37.643]  Fairness doctrine could lead to government regulation of the internet.
[00:03:37.643 --> 00:03:45.691]  If that isn't, uh, if all the other attacks on free speech aren't bad enough in the flotilla, the, the, the, the arsenal, the legion,
[00:03:49.117 --> 00:03:54.860]  Of attacks on the internet, the concerted attack to shut it down and butcher it and regulate it and tax it is enough.
[00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.320]  Here comes the fairness doctrine.
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.501]  You gotta love that Orwellian term.
[00:03:58.501 --> 00:04:01.823]  Destroys the First Amendment, but they call it fair.
[00:04:01.823 --> 00:04:05.665]  It's fair for being fair for the Patriot Act, aren't you?
[00:04:05.665 --> 00:04:08.106]  You're for Homeland Security.
[00:04:08.106 --> 00:04:12.368]  Total insecurity with a nightmare federal international police force.
[00:04:12.368 --> 00:04:12.988]  Speaking of that,
[00:04:13.897 --> 00:04:17.058]  New York City proposes massive public snooping system.
[00:04:17.058 --> 00:04:18.358]  This is from CBS News.
[00:04:18.358 --> 00:04:22.919]  Now, now, now, let me be clear here.
[00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.379]  They're just introducing this to you.
[00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:31.061]  New York's had this in place since before 9-11, the license plate reading systems.
[00:04:31.061 --> 00:04:40.383]  The states, through federalism, through federal funding since 1999, have had license plate reading cameras up.
[00:04:40.383 --> 00:04:42.363]  They're just now telling the slaves as well.
[00:04:43.157 --> 00:04:53.384]  So we'll go into this total grid, tracking every person that enters New York City, like it's another country, with airport-style security entering.
[00:04:53.384 --> 00:04:59.629]  And all emails, all text messages, not just to be read by federal government, by local governments, we'll cover that too.
[00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:01.590]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.011]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:05.833]  A new world order.
[00:05:05.833 --> 00:05:10.256]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:13.531]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:05:13.531 --> 00:05:16.333]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[00:05:16.333 --> 00:05:19.516]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:19.516 --> 00:05:26.822]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:29.858 --> 00:05:35.322]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:35.322 --> 00:05:39.184]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:39.184 --> 00:05:41.746]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:41.746 --> 00:05:42.907]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:42.907 --> 00:05:43.687]  They're not after money.
[00:05:43.687 --> 00:05:44.968]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:44.968 --> 00:05:45.949]  They're after power.
[00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:47.090]  That's what Africa needs here.

[00:05:58.637 --> 00:05:59.658]  You have been warned.
[00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:09.444]  Even terrible gas prices don't come close to the disaster of food costs from shortages already destroying millions of American families.
[00:06:09.444 --> 00:06:13.467]  Wheat for flour is already four times more expensive than it was about a year ago.
[00:06:13.467 --> 00:06:17.510]  Food costs continue to double because there's no food worldwide.
[00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:26.836]  The only solution is to use now and store for later great flavored super bulk foods that cost half as much as your groceries cost last year.

[00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:23.904]  of how to safely prepare and store all types of survival foods in an event of social unrest and food shortages here in the U.S.
[00:07:23.904 --> 00:07:26.646]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[00:07:26.646 --> 00:07:28.768]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[00:07:28.768 --> 00:07:29.748]  this fall?
[00:07:29.748 --> 00:07:30.669]  Don't wait.

[00:08:04.328 --> 00:08:07.109]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:24.634 --> 00:08:25.334]  Welcome back.
[00:08:25.334 --> 00:08:30.476]  It is Wednesday, the 13th day.
[00:08:30.476 --> 00:08:33.638]  Already getting into the middle of August.
[00:08:33.638 --> 00:08:41.902]  Running back through the headlines, I had gotten to the point of snooper chatter to check texts and emails.
[00:08:42.899 --> 00:08:53.686]  Local governments, health authorities, and hundreds of other public bodies are to be given the power to access details of everyone's personal text, emails, and internet use under Home Office proposals published yesterday.
[00:08:53.686 --> 00:08:58.929]  This is England, but this is already happening here in the United States, but it's done in upgrades.
[00:08:58.929 --> 00:09:08.816]  The feds in the name of Y2K built federal command bunkers all over Europe, and I say feds, the global federal government, and that's what it is, the world federalist system,
[00:09:10.023 --> 00:09:12.208]  The same names, the same programs.
[00:09:12.208 --> 00:09:13.270]  It's all standardized.
[00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:16.516]  England, Germany, the United States, China, Japan.
[00:09:17.914 --> 00:09:22.715]  And, uh, we're going to be going over that for you today and how this works.
[00:09:22.715 --> 00:09:36.658]  They put in these fusion centers, these emergency management centers, and they move in the National Guard, local police, the state, everybody there, uh, bivouacked as a military sentinel over each city in the United States.
[00:09:36.658 --> 00:09:42.020]  We are a declared war zone occupied, uh, by the international government.
[00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:47.261]  NORTHCOM's stated job is to carry out suppression of, uh, the people.
[00:09:47.964 --> 00:09:53.989]  of the United States, and that's now public in PDD 51, John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[00:09:53.989 --> 00:10:08.760]  It's all there, and we've had top scholars, former CIA analysts, former White House historians, constitutional lawyers, all on to tell you that it is not a joke, it is not a game, and they're putting this in place because they're going to hurt you real bad.
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:14.424]  They're going to force deadly vaccines on you, more drugs in the water supply, more forced medication to the water supply,
[00:10:15.604 --> 00:10:30.611]  More eugenics programs, more economic destruction, they're gonna force people to have their children in school, more than eight hours a day government school, outlawing homeschoolings already happening in multiple states, forced inoculations, this is hell world!
[00:10:30.611 --> 00:10:34.373]  And the grid is almost in place.
[00:10:34.373 --> 00:10:35.973]  You will see it all happen!
[00:10:35.973 --> 00:10:40.275]  You will watch it all unfold!
[00:10:40.275 --> 00:10:41.856]  Unless we wake up and say no.
[00:10:45.285 --> 00:10:50.288]  Some of the other interesting news, scientists stopped the aging process, ABC News.
[00:10:50.288 --> 00:10:55.870]  Scientists have stopped the aging process in an entire organ for the first time, a study released today says.
[00:10:55.870 --> 00:11:00.413]  So that's some of what we'll also be going over.
[00:11:00.413 --> 00:11:05.335]  Let me go ahead and get into military news in detail first for you.
[00:11:05.335 --> 00:11:12.759]  Largest naval deployment since 1991 heads for the Persian Gulf.
[00:11:12.759 --> 00:11:13.179]  Kuwait
[00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:17.411]  Activates emergency war plans as three U.S.
[00:11:17.411 --> 00:11:24.276]  warships steam towards Iran with each ship with its auxiliary ships.
[00:11:24.276 --> 00:11:29.020]  They're going to have now five naval task forces there in the region.
[00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:29.660]  Unbelievable!
[00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:36.926]  That's the biggest since 1990 build-up during Desert Shield, Desert Storm.
[00:11:36.926 --> 00:11:38.367]  The latest naval development
[00:11:39.514 --> 00:11:44.057]  He's the largest since 1991, is unfolding as no less than three U.S.
[00:11:44.057 --> 00:11:55.545]  warships make their way towards the Persian Gulf, and what observers are calling an unprecedented buildup, while Kuwait has activated its highest alert in anticipation of a potential attack on Iran.
[00:11:56.218 --> 00:12:04.885]  Now, they had to have the police state in measure first here in the United States, England, Canada, and other areas in the global empire in case we don't like it.
[00:12:04.885 --> 00:12:08.007]  Doesn't matter if 80 plus percent of us in every poll don't want a war.
[00:12:08.007 --> 00:12:10.429]  They say, look, you don't run the country anymore.
[00:12:10.429 --> 00:12:12.731]  You just supply the young men for the meat grinder.
[00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:14.652]  You just pay the bills for the wars.
[00:12:14.652 --> 00:12:17.254]  Shut up, slaves!
[00:12:17.254 --> 00:12:22.518]  Just have it come into realization who we are so we can get our freedom back.
[00:12:22.518 --> 00:12:24.920]  But this illusion that we've got this freedom
[00:12:25.695 --> 00:12:30.098]  All we've got freedom to do is shoot our mouths off against it, and they're now trying to shut that down.
[00:12:30.098 --> 00:12:34.641]  Covering that later.
[00:12:34.641 --> 00:12:47.609]  According to reports, the USS Theodore Roosevelt, the USS Ronald Reagan, the USS Iwo Jima, are steaming towards the Middle East waters to reinforce the USS Abraham Lincoln, and the USS Payaloo, which are already in the region.
[00:12:47.609 --> 00:12:53.813]  They will be joined by a British Royal Navy Carrier Battle Group, and a French nuclear hunter-killer submarine group.
[00:12:55.569 --> 00:13:13.494]  The maneuvers represent the largest movement of warships into the region since the 1991 Gulf War and come just a week after Operation Brimstone, a drill which saw more than a dozen warships from the U.S., British, and French naval forces conducting war games in the Atlantic Ocean in preparation for a possible confrontation with Iran.
[00:13:13.494 --> 00:13:14.934]  They said that's what the drill was for.
[00:13:15.618 --> 00:13:20.559]  The development has fueled rumors that Georgia's sneak attack on Russia in South Ossetia, backed by U.S.
[00:13:20.559 --> 00:13:27.900]  and Israeli forces, was a shot across the bow to warn Russia against interfering in a strike on Iran, which could be imminent.
[00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:33.261]  Kuwait has activated its highest-priority emergency war plan in response to the naval deployment.
[00:13:33.261 --> 00:13:41.063]  Kuwait was caught by surprise last time when Iraq troops invaded the Small Emirate and routed the Kuwaiti army in just a few hours, a former U.S.
[00:13:41.063 --> 00:13:41.723]  diplomat told
[00:13:43.928 --> 00:13:45.548]  ...to Kuwait, told the Middle East Times.
[00:13:45.548 --> 00:13:49.589]  The Israeli news source, Debka File, speculates that the U.S.
[00:13:49.589 --> 00:13:53.250]  naval development could have five alternative implications.
[00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:58.031]  Let me briefly go through those five, what they're saying.
[00:13:58.031 --> 00:14:01.552]  And they love to brag what they're doing, so it's pretty accurate from Debka.
[00:14:01.552 --> 00:14:09.274]  The U.S., aided also by France, Britain, and Canada, is finalizing preparations for a partial naval blockade to deny Iran imports.
[00:14:10.407 --> 00:14:10.687]  I think?
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.663]  For the embargo by shutting the Strait of Hormuz oil route choke point, in which case the U.S.
[00:14:35.663 --> 00:14:41.907]  Naval and Air Forces stand ready to reopen the Strait and fight back any Iranian attempt to break through the blockade.
[00:14:41.907 --> 00:14:43.088]  That means the ships, U.S.
[00:14:43.088 --> 00:14:52.113]  ships and coalition ships, coalition of the wicked, will have to move in to that, what is it, just 30-40 miles across.
[00:14:52.113 --> 00:14:54.695]  The Iranians have more than 11,000 sunburns, which
[00:14:57.762 --> 00:15:04.790]  Sunburn emplacements, hundreds of sunburn emplacements with over 11,000 in place, which they've shown the media.
[00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:15.282]  The sunburns will fly, of course, at treetop level over the water and will blow the living daylights out of all of the ships, all of the coalition ships.
[00:15:15.282 --> 00:15:16.163]  This is unbelievable.
[00:15:17.299 --> 00:15:24.561]  Washington is developing forces as a backup for possible Israeli military attack on Iran's nuclear installations.
[00:15:24.561 --> 00:15:34.223]  Four, a potential rush of events in which U.S.-led blockade, Israel attack on Iranian reprisals pile up in a very short time and precipitate a major military crisis.
[00:15:34.223 --> 00:15:42.145]  We just had the biggest military crisis, the highest level escalation that we've had since 1961.
[00:15:42.145 --> 00:15:43.906]  Every top expert's been all over TV
[00:15:44.921 --> 00:15:56.626]  You know, all over print saying, yes, what happened with Russia this last week and this week with them moving nukes in and this clash in Georgia and the sneak attack on the Russian forces is the biggest escalation since 61.
[00:15:56.626 --> 00:15:58.427]  And I believe even bigger than that.
[00:15:58.427 --> 00:15:59.908]  Yes, the U.S.
[00:15:59.908 --> 00:16:03.630]  snuck attack through its client state, Georgia.
[00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:06.651]  And, of course, Israel's there commanding the military forces.
[00:16:06.651 --> 00:16:10.373]  The head of their defense agency is an Israeli.
[00:16:10.373 --> 00:16:12.974]  They're head of the foreign service, the foreign minister.
[00:16:13.756 --> 00:16:15.177]  of Georgia is an Israeli.
[00:16:15.177 --> 00:16:18.799]  It's unbelievable what Israel, the United States, and England are doing.
[00:16:18.799 --> 00:16:21.081]  It is unprecedented.
[00:16:21.081 --> 00:16:41.873]  While a massive deployment of this nature calls for long-planned, its occurrence at the time cannot be divorced from the flare-up of the caucus in war between Russia and Georgia, while Russia has strengthened its stake in the Caspian oil resources by its overwhelming military intervention against Georgia, the Americans are investing might in defending the primary Persian Gulf oil sources of the West and the Far East.
[00:16:45.129 --> 00:16:49.133]  So that's where we stand on that front.
[00:16:49.133 --> 00:16:58.283]  Meanwhile, ceasefire in Georgia dashes neocon predictions of Russian expansion in the region.
[00:16:58.283 --> 00:17:07.092]  Crystal, Krauthammer, Bolton, Cheney, they've all been in the New York Times and on the
[00:17:08.644 --> 00:17:15.489]  Fox News and everywhere else saying, Russia's going to take all of Georgia, Russia's going to attack Ukraine, we've got to move U.S.
[00:17:15.489 --> 00:17:17.711]  military forces in there to engage them.
[00:17:17.711 --> 00:17:21.734]  Engage the Russians?
[00:17:21.734 --> 00:17:28.679]  Georgia is like Texas, and they lost Texas, which had been part of their country for hundreds of years.
[00:17:28.679 --> 00:17:31.561]  In fact, it's been in there longer than Texas has been part of the U.S.
[00:17:31.561 --> 00:17:33.703]  They lost it in 91.
[00:17:33.703 --> 00:17:36.805]  They lost a lot of other satellites that they didn't deserve or didn't belong to them.
[00:17:38.081 --> 00:17:46.147]  Like the Czech Republic, Czech proper, both parts.
[00:17:46.147 --> 00:17:52.292]  Ukraine, to a certain extent Russian, it's part of the old Russian Empire, but you could say it deserved to break away.
[00:17:52.292 --> 00:18:03.340]  But Georgia, and then Georgia's snuck attack, when the Russians collapsed in 91, started slaughtering the ethnic Russians by the tens of thousands, so the UN moved in.
[00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:07.664]  And Russians went into the two purely Russian enclaves.
[00:18:09.056 --> 00:18:13.779]  Of Abkhazia and Ossetia.
[00:18:13.779 --> 00:18:16.881]  And they were snuck attack after, I don't know, they've been there since 92.
[00:18:16.881 --> 00:18:18.442]  How many years is that?
[00:18:18.442 --> 00:18:19.523]  Eight years and eight years.
[00:18:19.523 --> 00:18:22.324]  Sixteen years.
[00:18:22.324 --> 00:18:24.065]  Sixteen years.
[00:18:24.065 --> 00:18:29.989]  In Ossetia and surrounding areas and their snuck attack Thursday night by U.S.-backed forces with U.S.
[00:18:29.989 --> 00:18:32.751]  trainers leading them in Israeli commanders.
[00:18:32.751 --> 00:18:34.092]  They attack it.
[00:18:34.092 --> 00:18:34.632]  The Russians
[00:18:35.535 --> 00:18:46.106]  Have an incredibly moderate response, and push the forces out, destroy them regrouping, and pull back.
[00:18:46.106 --> 00:18:47.847]  It's just amazing.
[00:18:47.847 --> 00:18:50.130]  And now... Now...
[00:18:52.105 --> 00:18:55.308]  Well, let's go ahead and, when we come back from break, I'm going to play this clip.
[00:18:55.308 --> 00:19:06.038]  This is from C-SPAN and Fox News, Bolton and Krauthammer, running around, lying, exaggerating, saying Russia was going to invade all the other countries, saying troops need to be moved in, U.S.
[00:19:06.038 --> 00:19:11.563]  troops into Ukraine to face down the Russians.
[00:19:11.563 --> 00:19:17.329]  One of the oldest parts of the ancient Russian Empire that held back the Muslims is Serbia.
[00:19:18.439 --> 00:19:23.301]  Where three major battles over a 200 plus year period were won.
[00:19:23.301 --> 00:19:30.763]  Where tens of thousands of Slavs died.
[00:19:30.763 --> 00:19:36.785]  Orthodox Christians defeating the Muslims trying to take over Europe.
[00:19:36.785 --> 00:19:40.246]  And even before that, when there were Mongolian invasions.
[00:19:41.522 --> 00:19:43.644]  They beat them right there in Serbia.
[00:19:43.644 --> 00:19:44.664]  Right there in Kosovo.
[00:19:44.664 --> 00:19:47.006]  That is the holy battleground for them.
[00:19:47.006 --> 00:19:47.286]  U.S.
[00:19:47.286 --> 00:19:53.191]  came in, blew the hell out of them with Muslim terrorists, handed it over to the Muslims in Albania.
[00:19:53.191 --> 00:19:55.372]  The Russians saw that.
[00:19:55.372 --> 00:19:57.734]  The globalists have encircled Russia.
[00:19:57.734 --> 00:19:59.055]  They're trying to launch more attacks.
[00:20:01.244 --> 00:20:03.385]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:20:03.385 --> 00:20:05.845]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:20:05.845 --> 00:20:08.066]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:20:08.066 --> 00:20:09.646]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:20:09.646 --> 00:20:11.327]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:20:11.327 --> 00:20:14.228]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:20:14.228 --> 00:20:17.869]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:20:27.531 --> 00:20:32.400]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:43.865]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:20:43.865 --> 00:20:46.606]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:20:46.606 --> 00:20:53.091]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[00:20:58.194 --> 00:21:00.656]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:21:01.112 --> 00:21:02.153]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:02.153 --> 00:21:07.117]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:21:07.117 --> 00:21:15.184]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:21:15.184 --> 00:21:20.769]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:21:20.769 --> 00:21:27.735]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:21:28.035 --> 00:21:33.617]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:21:33.617 --> 00:21:38.698]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:21:38.698 --> 00:21:46.641]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:21:46.641 --> 00:21:49.322]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt,
[00:21:49.782 --> 00:21:53.185]  Gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:21:53.185 --> 00:21:54.466]  For more information call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:54.466 --> 00:21:54.666]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.164 --> 00:22:03.485]  Gas prices are out of control!
[00:22:03.485 --> 00:22:07.368]  Fight back by doing what thousands of listeners to the Alex Jones Show have done.
[00:22:07.368 --> 00:22:10.430]  Developed by a major oil company, a product that really works.
[00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:14.192]  Introducing SFR's Protect-A-Complete fuel system and engine treatment.
[00:22:14.192 --> 00:22:16.953]  Just one bottle increases mileage for up to six months.
[00:22:16.953 --> 00:22:20.736]  Fleet tested by major oil companies showing improvements in every car tested.
[00:22:20.736 --> 00:22:24.418]  Stop paying mechanics your hard-earned money to have your injection system cleaned.
[00:22:24.418 --> 00:22:29.801]  Protect-A-Clean's up to 95% of new injector condition in just one tankful and is safe for all cars.
[00:22:30.041 --> 00:22:30.602]  I think so.
[00:23:00.948 --> 00:23:07.092]  Have you ever suffered from giardia, food poisoning, heavy metal poisoning, arthritis, fatigue, or high cholesterol?
[00:23:07.092 --> 00:23:13.656]  Maybe you're one of the 75 million Americans that the Center for Disease Control reports as suffering from internal parasites.
[00:23:13.656 --> 00:23:22.681]  If so, Freshwater Organics is proud to introduce you to a million-year-old miracle that has been used all over the world by health-conscious individuals seeking alternatives to chemicals and drugs.

[00:23:30.285 --> 00:23:35.569]  When taken daily, it is an excellent source of natural plant-based silica with 14 trace minerals.
[00:23:35.569 --> 00:23:38.590]  Many believe it is the key to a healthy digestive tract.

[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:51.981]  That's 888-949-3570.
[00:24:18.178 --> 00:24:19.419]  All right, welcome back.
[00:24:19.419 --> 00:24:25.983]  Let's go ahead and play this little compilation of clips from Fox and C-SPAN.
[00:24:25.983 --> 00:24:34.588]  There's two top neocons, Crownhammer and Bolton, shoot their mouths off and try to escalate the crisis with Russia.
[00:24:34.588 --> 00:24:35.449]  Here it is.
[00:24:35.449 --> 00:24:39.111]  What do you think that Russia is up to right now in Georgia?
[00:24:39.111 --> 00:24:43.474]  Well, I think this is the first step possibly in Putin's effort to
[00:24:44.381 --> 00:24:46.122]  Uh, recreate the Soviet Union.
[00:24:46.122 --> 00:24:52.743]  You know, he called the collapse of the Soviet Union the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century.
[00:24:52.743 --> 00:25:04.287]  And, uh, frankly, that's one reason I'm disturbed at the administration's kind of laid-back response, because as important as Georgia is, if this is simply a part of a bigger picture, there's a lot more at stake.
[00:25:04.287 --> 00:25:06.147]  Russians are advancing.
[00:25:06.147 --> 00:25:07.948]  There's nothing that will stop them.
[00:25:07.948 --> 00:25:09.628]  We're not going to go to war over Georgia.
[00:25:09.628 --> 00:25:12.729]  Uh, we were unprepared, and the Georgians were unprepared.
[00:25:13.525 --> 00:25:14.925]  The question is, what can we do?
[00:25:14.925 --> 00:25:21.027]  The battle will end when the Russians achieve whatever is their objective.
[00:25:21.027 --> 00:25:28.488]  Obviously, it starts with the taking over of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which has already happened.
[00:25:28.488 --> 00:25:33.810]  It goes on to the destruction of the Georgian Armed Forces, which is now happening.
[00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:39.231]  And the third will probably be the replacement of the elected government, which is pro-Western.
[00:25:40.338 --> 00:25:41.078]  We're good to go.
[00:25:59.526 --> 00:26:04.789]  Immediately to declare that we are going to protect Ukraine, which is the next step.
[00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:07.130]  Ukraine is the big prize here.
[00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:14.294]  Perhaps station the troops and perhaps begin an admission process of Ukraine into NATO.
[00:26:14.294 --> 00:26:26.720]  Now, what they're doing is, the West is, the same elite that's enslaving us, has launched a provocative sneak attack on the Russians, lied to the dumbed-down population and told them that Russia
[00:26:27.623 --> 00:26:41.891]  Out of the clear blue, just attack Georgia for no reason, and claim that Russia violated international law, when in truth, the United States, Israel, and NATO, with a sneak attack, violated international law.
[00:26:41.891 --> 00:26:43.933]  That was an international zone.
[00:26:43.933 --> 00:26:45.634]  Russia was following the treaty.
[00:26:46.818 --> 00:26:54.500]  A treaty was violated in a sneak attack, as dastardly as it gets, but they know the public doesn't know which end is up or even what continent they live on.
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:56.861]  The public doesn't have any idea, on average.
[00:26:56.861 --> 00:26:58.321]  No idea about anything.
[00:26:58.321 --> 00:26:59.622]  How anything works.
[00:26:59.622 --> 00:27:03.783]  And so they can lie and say this, Russia has now stopped.
[00:27:03.783 --> 00:27:10.485]  They are saying they're not going to allow any weapons to be shipped in from Israel or NATO for a counterattack against them after they've already repulsed one attack.
[00:27:12.029 --> 00:27:16.692]  Meanwhile, they're moving missile systems, radar, uh, there are thousands of U.S.
[00:27:16.692 --> 00:27:17.773]  troops currently in Ukraine.
[00:27:17.773 --> 00:27:19.794]  They've been there for at least seven years.
[00:27:19.794 --> 00:27:20.935]  There is a massive buildup.
[00:27:20.935 --> 00:27:22.476]  Russia's saying, stop it!
[00:27:22.476 --> 00:27:38.046]  And there are several Russian enclaves on the border with Russia there as well, and look for the West to start another fight there, and then say, oh my god, we snuck attack the Russians again, and they had a reserved response to us, and only defended themselves.
[00:27:38.046 --> 00:27:39.728]  How dare them!
[00:27:39.728 --> 00:27:41.749]  How dare them fight back when they're snuck attack!
[00:27:42.269 --> 00:27:44.410]  And you're going to see that with Iran.
[00:27:44.410 --> 00:28:05.496]  If they attack Iran the next few months, which it looks like they may be planning to do, I pray it doesn't happen, then when Iran fights back in any way, if they shoot a peace shooter or a slingshot rock back at any of these missiles or munitions being dropped on them, it will be, oh my God, oh my God, Iran's snuck attack.
[00:28:05.496 --> 00:28:06.496]  Won't matter if the U.S.
[00:28:06.496 --> 00:28:08.517]  is bombarding them for a week before they respond.
[00:28:08.517 --> 00:28:09.317]  They'll just tell the public,
[00:28:10.285 --> 00:28:11.506]  We did nothing and they attacked.
[00:28:11.506 --> 00:28:14.327]  And the public will say, my God, Iran attacked us.
[00:28:14.327 --> 00:28:17.908]  I mean, that is the dumbed-down nature of this population.
[00:28:17.908 --> 00:28:26.272]  It is just off the charts, hard to believe how bamboozled the public is.
[00:28:26.272 --> 00:28:33.195]  How completely buffaloed they are by any level of ridiculous garbage out of the New World Order crowd.
[00:28:33.195 --> 00:28:34.536]  The Anglo-American world empire.
[00:28:36.972 --> 00:28:46.300]  Which we pay for, which our name's destroyed by, which our dollar is based on and now being debased and destroyed.
[00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:48.161]  Amazing.
[00:28:48.161 --> 00:28:52.785]  Absolutely amazing to see them getting... I keep saying amazing because I am speechless.
[00:28:52.785 --> 00:28:55.968]  Meanwhile, the neocons now love international law.
[00:28:55.968 --> 00:28:58.210]  Story up on InfoWars.com from Assortium News.
[00:28:59.025 --> 00:29:10.308]  It's touching how American neoconservatives have had no regard for international law when they want to invade some troublesome country, have developed a sudden reverence for national sovereignty.
[00:29:10.308 --> 00:29:12.009]  Apparently, context is everything.
[00:29:12.009 --> 00:29:24.253]  So the United States attacking Granada, Nicaragua, Panama, Iraq, and Serbia is justified even if the reasons sometimes don't hold water or don't hold up before the United Nations, the Hague, or institutions of international law.
[00:29:24.253 --> 00:29:25.073]  However, when Russia
[00:29:26.085 --> 00:29:27.186]  We're on the march.
[00:29:27.186 --> 00:29:28.067]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.601 --> 00:29:58.287]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.531 --> 00:30:04.392]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:30:04.392 --> 00:30:05.952]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[00:30:05.952 --> 00:30:08.093]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:30:08.093 --> 00:30:09.993]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:30:09.993 --> 00:30:11.474]  The late, great USA.
[00:30:11.474 --> 00:30:13.254]  America, freedom to fascism.

[00:31:06.471 --> 00:31:09.792]  Tonight, I have a date with the very lovely Rachel.
[00:31:09.792 --> 00:31:16.214]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[00:31:16.654 --> 00:31:19.277]  Online from my desk with Webex.
[00:31:19.277 --> 00:31:22.560]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:27.344]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[00:31:27.344 --> 00:31:31.287]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[00:31:31.287 --> 00:31:32.909]  Travel less, meet online.

[00:32:00.786 --> 00:32:06.708]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[00:32:06.708 --> 00:32:11.509]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[00:32:11.509 --> 00:32:16.931]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[00:32:16.931 --> 00:32:20.372]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[00:32:20.852 --> 00:32:29.377]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[00:32:29.377 --> 00:32:35.180]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:41.163]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[00:32:41.163 --> 00:32:43.484]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[00:32:43.744 --> 00:32:46.406]  Cannot survive in an alkaline environment?

[00:33:55.811 --> 00:33:57.634]  Baby, baby.
[00:33:57.634 --> 00:34:02.320]  Sweet little baby, you don't have to go.
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:06.185]  Little baby, tell me you won't go.
[00:34:13.771 --> 00:34:23.473]  Neocons now love international law.
[00:34:23.473 --> 00:34:38.655]  It's touching how American neoconservatives, who have no regard for international law, when they want to invade some troublesome country, have developed a sudden reverence for national sovereignty.
[00:34:45.103 --> 00:34:45.403]  U.S.
[00:34:45.403 --> 00:34:53.327]  newspapers such as the New York Times see nothing wrong with publishing a statement from President George Bush declaring that Georgia
[00:34:54.039 --> 00:34:58.480]  ...is a sovereign nation, and its territorial integrity must be respected.
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:02.742]  No one points out that Bush should have zero standing enunciating such a principle.
[00:35:02.742 --> 00:35:14.045]  Iraq also is a sovereign nation, but Bush invaded it under false pretenses, demolished its army, overthrew its government, and then conducted a lengthy military occupation resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths.
[00:35:14.045 --> 00:35:21.507]  And I would add, our criminal government put Saddam into power and then set him up to invade Kuwait and attack Iran and everything else, so that's... it's even worse.
[00:35:24.395 --> 00:35:31.580]  And carried out a lengthy military operation that resulted in hundreds of thousands of dead.
[00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:36.703]  The invasion of Iraq also wasn't a spur-of-the-moment decision.
[00:35:36.703 --> 00:35:44.748]  In the months after the 9-11 attacks, Bush proclaimed an exceptional right of the United States to invade any country that might become a threat to American security or the U.S.
[00:35:44.748 --> 00:35:48.150]  global dominance.
[00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:49.291]  Remember all the speeches he gave?
[00:35:49.969 --> 00:35:54.511]  When asked questions about international law, Bush would joke, it's international law, I better call my lawyer.
[00:35:54.511 --> 00:35:57.933]  The neocon's contempt for international law goes back even further.
[00:35:57.933 --> 00:35:59.473]  And then they list all of that.
[00:35:59.473 --> 00:36:00.133]  I mean, think about it.
[00:36:00.133 --> 00:36:08.457]  They go in, they set up the Taliban and Al Qaeda, they carry out the 9-11 attacks, and they claim that Afghanistan did.
[00:36:08.457 --> 00:36:16.661]  The Taliban chiefs were trying to hand over the subgroup of Taliban that they said, hey, it's your own intelligence operatives.
[00:36:16.661 --> 00:36:19.302]  Instead, they arrested the real Taliban and then flew
[00:36:20.638 --> 00:36:26.403]  The U.S., Taliban, and Al-Qaeda out to safety, 6,000 of them to Pakistan, and the airlift of evil.
[00:36:26.403 --> 00:36:40.814]  Just like a few weeks ago it came out in mainstream news that Seattle Times, Miami Herald, that Bin Laden's driver, who was actually a right-hand, not his driver, who they burned and turned out got, what, six months in jail because he did nothing.
[00:36:40.814 --> 00:36:50.162]  They kept him, but his bodyguard, who was actually doing things and running things, he got to Guantanamo, the special forces grabbed him, doing their job, and then he was released in one week, secretly.
[00:36:51.505 --> 00:37:02.813]  Because real Al-Qaeda is run by the New World Order.
[00:37:02.813 --> 00:37:05.015]  Alright.
[00:37:05.015 --> 00:37:08.938]  Getting into other military news.
[00:37:11.306 --> 00:37:14.449]  China welcomes Russia's announcement of ceasefire in South Ossetia.
[00:37:14.449 --> 00:37:19.354]  China said today it welcomed Russia's announcement to end military operation in Georgia's South Ossetia.
[00:37:19.354 --> 00:37:32.847]  China welcomes this and hopes that the move can help peacefully resolve disputes through dialogues and realize peace and stability in the region, said China's foreign ministry.
[00:37:32.847 --> 00:37:33.748]  Getting into other
[00:37:35.285 --> 00:37:39.146]  Russia, Georgia, U.S., Israel news, NATO news.
[00:37:39.146 --> 00:37:41.947]  Obama advisor compares Putin to Hitler.
[00:37:41.947 --> 00:37:55.170]  And I have to say that in the discussion we had Friday with Bob Chapman and Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Roberts is a great guy and we appreciate his input, Roberts was saying, well no, Brzezinski isn't involved in any of this.
[00:37:55.170 --> 00:38:01.432]  This is the neocons and Bob Chapman and rightfully so, Webster Tarpley have said no.
[00:38:02.535 --> 00:38:12.722]  This is the policy directive by the big Rothschild elite, basically out of England, to encircle and attack Russia.
[00:38:12.722 --> 00:38:17.265]  And the neocons now are becoming more and more backseaters.
[00:38:17.265 --> 00:38:19.327]  Obama advisor compares Putin to Hitler.
[00:38:19.327 --> 00:38:21.869]  And this is the London Guardian today illustrating that.
[00:38:21.869 --> 00:38:23.890]  It is Brzezinski driving much of this.
[00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:24.590]  The former U.S.
[00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:30.935]  National Security Advisor, Zbigniew Brzezinski, has called for the world community to isolate Russia in protest over its campaign in the Caucasus.
[00:38:31.917 --> 00:38:37.361]  Likening its tactics to those of Hitler or Stalin.
[00:38:37.361 --> 00:38:52.971]  Brzezinski, who was the National Security Advisor to President Jimmy Carter, and is now an advisor to Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, said the Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin was following a course that is horrifyingly similar to that taken by Stalin and Hitler in the 1930s.
[00:38:52.971 --> 00:38:57.554]  Really, I thought it was Stalin and Hitler sneak attacking people, not the other way around.
[00:38:57.554 --> 00:38:58.515]  Russia attacked no one.
[00:38:59.341 --> 00:39:12.309]  He said that Putin's justification for splitting up Georgia because of the Russian citizens living in South Ossetia could be compared to when Hitler used the alleged suffering of ethnic Germans in the Sudetenland as a pretext of annexing Czechoslovakia in 1938.
[00:39:12.309 --> 00:39:15.150]  Well, they have not annexed anything.
[00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:19.493]  The Russians have always been in Ossetia and Abkhazia and other areas.
[00:39:19.493 --> 00:39:22.435]  The Russians were attacked.
[00:39:22.435 --> 00:39:24.456]  Georgia has historically been part of
[00:39:27.262 --> 00:39:27.663]  Russia.
[00:39:27.663 --> 00:39:29.846]  I'm surprised to secure their flank.
[00:39:29.846 --> 00:39:39.739]  Russia didn't go in to Tbilisi and take over the capital and throw out the puppet.
[00:39:39.739 --> 00:39:42.022]  In an interview with the conservative daily German DeWalt,
[00:39:42.822 --> 00:39:53.732]  He said, even more striking were the parallels between Putin's strategy against Georgia and Stalin's invasion of Finland in 1939, describing both as undermining of the sovereignty of a small democratic neighboring state through the use of violence.
[00:39:53.732 --> 00:39:55.494]  Hey, who used violence first?
[00:39:55.494 --> 00:39:59.718]  Georgia is to the extent what Finland of today, both morally and strategically.
[00:39:59.718 --> 00:40:01.619]  That's not true.
[00:40:01.619 --> 00:40:04.762]  Georgia is totally tied to Russia historically.
[00:40:04.762 --> 00:40:05.963]  Finland isn't.
[00:40:05.963 --> 00:40:07.425]  Except in trade, they're in the North Sea.
[00:40:08.954 --> 00:40:11.437]  So, just more incredible propaganda.
[00:40:11.437 --> 00:40:15.120]  EU may send peacekeepers to enforce ceasefire in South Ossetia.
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:23.408]  European Union could send peacekeepers to the breakaway region of South Ossetia, I guess to back up more sneak attacks against the Russians, to help enforce the ceasefire between Russia and Georgia.
[00:40:23.408 --> 00:40:28.193]  EU foreign ministers announced support for the plan to send peacekeepers as an emergency meeting in Brussels today.
[00:40:29.514 --> 00:40:31.535]  Russia has stopped their advance.
[00:40:31.535 --> 00:40:33.696]  They wiped out the military forces that attacked them.
[00:40:33.696 --> 00:40:43.619]  When they tried to regroup just 10 miles south of Ossetia, they attacked them while the Georgians were still launching rocket attacks.
[00:40:43.619 --> 00:40:54.803]  The Irish Development Minister, Peter Power, said the EU is ready to engage, including on the ground, to support the efforts of the United Nations on the OSCE Organization for Economic Co-operative Development.
[00:40:56.331 --> 00:41:01.274]  And that's the real bankruptcy arm that grew out of the Marshall Plan with the Germans.
[00:41:01.274 --> 00:41:12.000]  And if you really want to know who manages things and sets international treaties, and who's more powerful than the IMF and World Bank, and sits above those, it is the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, I would add.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.103]  He added the details of the EU peacekeeping plan would be discussed at a meeting next month.
[00:41:17.103 --> 00:41:19.684]  So you see, they're having trouble getting Georgia into NATO.
[00:41:19.684 --> 00:41:21.585]  Now they're saying, well, those hopes are dashed.
[00:41:21.585 --> 00:41:22.766]  But really, by
[00:41:24.326 --> 00:41:28.168]  Fiat, it is becoming part of NATO and a NATO state.
[00:41:28.168 --> 00:41:43.576]  Just like they had the Muslims out of Albania for several years attack the Serbs till they repulsed their attack in Serbia proper, that's what Kosovo was, then the United Nations and NATO forces took over, forcibly removed the
[00:41:44.418 --> 00:41:59.870]  Serbian security forces built up armaments in the country and began ethnic cleansing against Serbs and forced them out of the country, which has now totally fallen last year, to the Muslims and been recognized and now part of Albania.
[00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:00.471]  Think about that!
[00:42:00.471 --> 00:42:05.315]  They are stealing countries, they are taking over nations, they are bringing Muslims in,
[00:42:05.976 --> 00:42:10.118]  Well, they talk all day about giving up your rights because the evil Muslims are going to get you any minute.
[00:42:10.118 --> 00:42:27.367]  Meanwhile, every time we turn around, they're using Muslim shock forces to take over Afghanistan, to take over Iran, to take over Serbia and Kosovo, to take over different sectors in the south of Georgia.
[00:42:27.367 --> 00:42:28.468]  This is an absorption.
[00:42:28.468 --> 00:42:30.429]  It's like Israel helped create
[00:42:31.437 --> 00:42:46.761]  Hamas in the 1970s as a quote, this is mainstream Israeli news, as a counterweight to Hezbollah playing the Shiites and Sunnis off against each other.
[00:42:46.761 --> 00:42:53.023]  The plan is total balkanization including here in the United States with the Southwest being handed over to Mexican nationals.
[00:42:53.023 --> 00:42:55.223]  You see the same program over and over again.
[00:42:55.223 --> 00:42:57.144]  You're getting deep analysis here ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:02.088 --> 00:43:09.851]  That is a horrible escalation to move in NATO and EU troops.
[00:43:09.851 --> 00:43:27.278]  By the way, the Russians knew an attack was coming because they had NATO and UN troops who the day before started disappearing from the different security bases in South Ossetia and the other breakaway republic bordering Russia in the north of Georgia.
[00:43:28.556 --> 00:43:35.722]  That's why Russian tribes were able to mass on the border, knowing an attack was coming in the next days or weeks.
[00:43:35.722 --> 00:43:36.623]  Hey, where are the U.N.
[00:43:36.623 --> 00:43:37.484]  guys?
[00:43:37.484 --> 00:43:41.167]  Hey, where are the... There were Georgian peacekeepers mixing with them.
[00:43:41.167 --> 00:43:41.827]  Well, where are they?
[00:43:41.827 --> 00:43:42.468]  Where'd everybody go?
[00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:45.221]  INCOMING ROCKET ATTACKS!
[00:43:45.221 --> 00:43:54.863]  Massive, you know, 10,000 man attack force just moving in with huge self-propelled rocket batteries, tanks, helicopters, fighter jets led by U.S.
[00:43:54.863 --> 00:43:56.363]  and Israeli forces.
[00:43:56.363 --> 00:44:01.685]  Smashing in, mass murdering thousands.
[00:44:01.685 --> 00:44:09.707]  A dastardly, wicked, I mean the history of warfare, sneak attacks are just, and not a sneak attack once a war is already going.
[00:44:10.737 --> 00:44:17.120]  But a sneak attack, not even a sneak attack during a truce, just a sneak attack!
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:31.028]  And I've got people on the InfoWars.com message board, essentially people posting on the stories of the message board, and on the President Biden message board saying we're lying, and that Russia attacked Georgia out of the blue.
[00:44:31.028 --> 00:44:39.112]  And I had a caller yesterday, who I recognize as a routine caller who supposedly likes the show, saying, you know, the domino effect, the Russians attack, they're taking over, Alex, you're siding with the commies.
[00:44:41.596 --> 00:44:42.376]  The commies?
[00:44:42.376 --> 00:44:43.717]  What is our government?
[00:44:43.717 --> 00:44:48.819]  All these hundreds of new taxes and regulations and face-scanning cameras and black uniforms and all?
[00:44:48.819 --> 00:44:51.621]  I mean, this is a bunch of bull!
[00:44:51.621 --> 00:44:53.722]  Russia isn't attacking the United States.
[00:44:53.722 --> 00:44:55.683]  It's not attacking our interest.
[00:44:55.683 --> 00:45:00.425]  It wants to sell technology and oil and raw materials to us.
[00:45:03.726 --> 00:45:04.787]  I mean, I study this.
[00:45:04.787 --> 00:45:06.007]  I bring the top experts.
[00:45:06.007 --> 00:45:10.770]  Liberal, conservative, libertarian, White House, CIA, foreign, Nobel Prize winners.
[00:45:10.770 --> 00:45:11.991]  We have real discussions here.
[00:45:11.991 --> 00:45:21.557]  Okay, coming up, economic news.
[00:45:21.557 --> 00:45:24.939]  Oil rises for the first time in four days as dollar weakens.
[00:45:24.939 --> 00:45:29.261]  FCC Commissioner Fairness Doctrine could lead to government regulation of the web.
[00:45:29.261 --> 00:45:31.203]  That's the FCC Chairman on video.
[00:45:31.203 --> 00:45:31.763]  That's coming up.
[00:45:32.452 --> 00:45:35.674]  I don't want to hear any more denials about this.
[00:45:35.674 --> 00:45:36.815]  I'm tired of it.
[00:45:36.815 --> 00:45:37.716]  Stop!
[00:45:37.716 --> 00:45:50.244]  You know, we play that CNN clip where they've declared martial law on a town, and say you can't come out of your house even during the day, and people are on the comment section saying, Alex, you know, they say martial law and the peace, but you're, you're misrepresenting it and saying it's bad.
[00:45:50.244 --> 00:45:53.666]  You know, they're just trying to give people safety.
[00:45:53.666 --> 00:45:58.309]  Oh my God.
[00:45:58.309 --> 00:46:01.071]  But speaking of the police state, let's, let's shift gears.
[00:46:01.071 --> 00:46:01.191]  Now,
[00:46:02.509 --> 00:46:12.281]  Starting 11 years ago, because I'm in Austin, kind of the Silicon Valley of the Texas Hill Country.
[00:46:12.281 --> 00:46:15.385]  And so a lot of the planners live here.
[00:46:15.385 --> 00:46:22.073]  It's also the capital, so we get a lot of state news from the second most populous state, and the second geographically largest state, after Alaska.
[00:46:23.354 --> 00:46:26.156]  And so we get sent videos from inside DPS.
[00:46:26.156 --> 00:46:31.659]  We aired on AXS seven, no, eight years ago, where the guy shot video of the computer screens.
[00:46:31.659 --> 00:46:33.560]  I already knew it from federal documents.
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:38.262]  It was already been announced in international agreements.
[00:46:38.262 --> 00:46:50.689]  It's already a world ID, but I had the video inside, where on the inside of the computer systems, your driver's license is now called a universal ID number, a quote, national ID card.
[00:46:50.689 --> 00:46:51.510]  And I showed that to you.
[00:46:52.111 --> 00:47:00.955]  See, now they're just now getting around to announcing it's a national ID card this year, when we already have a world ID card since 2000, a national ID card under executive order since 93.
[00:47:00.955 --> 00:47:04.396]  Your local driver's license and ID cards are federal.
[00:47:04.396 --> 00:47:05.637]  Now they're international.
[00:47:05.637 --> 00:47:09.499]  See, once it's federalized, then it can be internationalized.
[00:47:09.499 --> 00:47:21.184]  Called munialization.
[00:47:21.184 --> 00:47:21.544]  Oh, boy.
[00:47:23.121 --> 00:47:26.743]  Munialization.
[00:47:26.743 --> 00:47:39.069]  So, all of this is unfolding and happening, and let me just tell you, I learned, I don't know, ten, eleven years ago, before it was ever even in industry publications, and it was in industry publications nine years ago.
[00:47:40.496 --> 00:47:59.771]  That the cameras they were putting up all over the country were hooked into FEMA, hooked into NORTHCOM, was already set up at the time, though not publicly, and they were watching everyone in live time and scanning all of your license plates in real time, and they were going to introduce it to the public as, quote, local traffic management through the local emergency center, but that that was really a federalization center, and I told you.
[00:47:59.771 --> 00:48:07.717]  And then I remember eight years ago, the first town announced in Florida, every car that drives through our city, we run your plates.
[00:48:07.717 --> 00:48:09.038]  You're guilty until proven innocent,
[00:48:10.434 --> 00:48:11.975]  It violates the Fourth Amendment, they do it.
[00:48:11.975 --> 00:48:22.663]  And then they announced, oh, the state of Indiana is doing it seven years ago, and oh, San Antonio is doing it six years ago, and oh, Houston, and New York, and Dallas, and hundreds of articles.
[00:48:22.663 --> 00:48:36.293]  And then, it's in Matrix of Evil, six years ago, the governor of Wisconsin says, oh, we've put in local federal emergency centers, and we're tracking all your cell phones in real time down to
[00:48:36.997 --> 00:48:43.344]  A few feet of where you're at, and we can dial in and listen to your phone in case you're in trouble, and the police can just dial in your name and pull this up.
[00:48:43.344 --> 00:48:44.665]  So that was the first thing to implement.
[00:48:44.665 --> 00:48:50.992]  See, see, they put in the computer systems, the federal centers the cops go to, and the local managers go to, and then they give them upgrades.
[00:48:50.992 --> 00:48:52.093]  Oh, there's this new upgrade.
[00:48:52.093 --> 00:48:53.534]  It was already all in place.
[00:48:53.534 --> 00:48:55.116]  They just, oh, you got a new upgrade this week.
[00:48:55.959 --> 00:48:59.622]  You know, uh, you only use this in an emergency, but you dial up wherever Alex Jones is.
[00:48:59.622 --> 00:49:04.625]  You want to see where Alex Jones is, enter his name, driver's license number, and then it pops up on a screen.
[00:49:04.625 --> 00:49:06.086]  That's where his cell phone is.
[00:49:06.086 --> 00:49:09.728]  Now, we've got a threat matrix here of all of his relationships.
[00:49:09.728 --> 00:49:11.770]  You want to see where his wife is.
[00:49:11.770 --> 00:49:18.574]  Well, you can see a list and, and, and, and punch in this number, and then it pulls up where all of his relations are.
[00:49:18.574 --> 00:49:21.276]  You want to see where his father is, the dentist.
[00:49:21.276 --> 00:49:22.317]  Well, you can see that that's
[00:49:22.992 --> 00:49:29.936]  You know, his first of kin is in red, his next level of kin is in blue, uh, then business relations are in green.
[00:49:29.936 --> 00:49:31.457]  I mean, this is what they do.
[00:49:31.457 --> 00:49:32.858]  And just, oh, let's see where Alex Jones is.
[00:49:32.858 --> 00:49:33.378]  Hmm.
[00:49:33.378 --> 00:49:36.620]  Alex Jones.
[00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:48.207]  Well, there's only in the technocrats in the police departments merging with the National Guard, merging, they'll have a CIA officer in major cities, liaisoning, and they're all there being federalized.
[00:49:48.207 --> 00:49:51.609]  And right next door in the other wing of the building is National Guard biblact.
[00:49:54.949 --> 00:49:58.372]  Do you understand the magnitude of this Pentagon-designed control grid?
[00:49:58.372 --> 00:50:02.234]  I mean, the MIT Magazine two years ago admitted, yes, it's Pentagon-designed.
[00:50:02.234 --> 00:50:05.557]  This is a total control grid, a theater of operations.
[00:50:05.557 --> 00:50:06.998]  No Fourth Amendment, nothing.
[00:50:06.998 --> 00:50:11.782]  Now, let's expand into England.
[00:50:11.782 --> 00:50:19.107]  They just calmly announce every day, oh, we're tracking your cell phone everywhere you go in live time, just like they're doing here.
[00:50:19.107 --> 00:50:21.689]  Oh, we're going ahead and randomly dialing in and listening to your phone.
[00:50:23.217 --> 00:50:24.937]  Now it's all over England, all over Europe.
[00:50:24.937 --> 00:50:28.098]  Snoopers chatter to check texts and emails.
[00:50:28.098 --> 00:50:30.479]  Hundreds of public bodies access personal details.
[00:50:30.479 --> 00:50:34.000]  Home office measures driven by EU directives.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.280]  See, it's all regionalized.
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:38.461]  Local councils, that's local government.
[00:50:38.461 --> 00:50:44.422]  Health authorities and hundreds of other public bodies are now to be given the power to access details of everyone's personal text messages.
[00:50:44.422 --> 00:50:45.442]  You see, they're in your phone.
[00:50:45.442 --> 00:50:48.143]  They hit one button that no warrant, no nothing.
[00:50:48.143 --> 00:50:48.343]  Folks,
[00:50:49.153 --> 00:50:52.534]  This is why they had to have Congress pass a law saying no warrants snooping.
[00:50:52.534 --> 00:50:54.634]  This is total tyranny.
[00:50:54.634 --> 00:51:01.496]  And they're doing this so they can move militarily against us and we can't stop them.
[00:51:01.496 --> 00:51:02.476]  Hey Clyde!
[00:51:02.476 --> 00:51:03.476]  What's up Bonnie?
[00:51:03.476 --> 00:51:07.918]  Well, I got a question about those shielded secure sleeves from Identity Stronghold.
[00:51:07.918 --> 00:51:12.659]  Yeah, the sleeves that block us from stealing account numbers from the new credit cards with RFID chips.
[00:51:12.659 --> 00:51:13.459]  What about them?
[00:51:13.459 --> 00:51:18.020]  Well, I mentioned them to our fri- Start saving hundreds of dollars in fees and interest payments.
[00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:23.203]  Care One agencies have helped over 4 million people get out of debt and they can help you too.
[00:51:23.203 --> 00:51:25.864]  Call 800-498-2981 800-498-2981 and find out how you can lower your monthly payments up to 57 percent.
[00:51:25.864 --> 00:51:27.805]  One 15-minute phone call can change your life.
[00:51:27.805 --> 00:51:28.185]  Call 800-498-2981 800-498-2981.
[00:51:28.185 --> 00:51:29.886]  Provider and licensing details are available.
[00:51:50.829 --> 00:52:04.365]  I hear the train a-comin' It's rollin' around my bed And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when I'm stuck in New World Order prison And time keeps draggin' on
[00:52:07.029 --> 00:52:34.467]  But that train keeps rollin' On down to San Antonio When I was just a baby My mama told me son Always be a good boy Don't ever play with guns But I shot a man in Reno Just to watch him die When I hear that whistle blowin'
[00:52:35.824 --> 00:52:38.165]  I hang my head and cry.
[00:52:38.165 --> 00:52:52.868]  Local governments, health authorities, hundreds of other public bodies are to be given the power to access details of everyone's personal text, emails, internet use under home office proposals published yesterday.
[00:52:52.868 --> 00:52:55.929]  Now you actually read they're already doing it for many years in England.
[00:52:55.929 --> 00:52:57.129]  Just like when they had a quote
[00:52:58.607 --> 00:53:19.494]  Healthcare Privacy Act in 2004, what it actually did was all of your healthcare data, all of your information, any pharmacy that ever takes any Medicare or Medicaid, not just from you, but from anybody, so basically everyone, that's where Ron Paul's office, practice doesn't take it, when he was doing it, is instantly uploaded to the federal government.
[00:53:19.494 --> 00:53:26.536]  No judge, no jury, no warrant, just like the know your customer stuff with banking, everything, the government's in your bank account.
[00:53:27.395 --> 00:53:28.336]  And of course, they're stealing.
[00:53:28.336 --> 00:53:29.557]  There's a lot of crooks in government.
[00:53:29.557 --> 00:53:33.320]  That's why there's so much... Most of your, uh, identity theft is government stealing.
[00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:35.541]  In some cases, it's come out millions of names.
[00:53:35.541 --> 00:53:43.347]  They sell them to foreign, uh, crime groups, who then steal your information, steal credit card information, and then buy things with it.
[00:53:43.347 --> 00:53:44.708]  It's just a criminal government.
[00:53:44.708 --> 00:53:46.990]  The whole government's built for criminals to rob you.
[00:53:50.106 --> 00:53:52.087]  And the same thing happening in England is happening here.
[00:53:52.087 --> 00:54:00.972]  Ministers want to make it mandatory for telephone and internet companies to keep details of all personal internet traffic for 12 months at least so it can be accessed by investigators into crime or other threats to public safety.
[00:54:00.972 --> 00:54:04.634]  They will have instant access to all of it in real time and it just goes on.
[00:54:04.634 --> 00:54:10.398]  That's under the EU Constitution, which England's already under following the orders.
[00:54:10.398 --> 00:54:13.259]  It's like we're under the NAU but they won't tell you that.
[00:54:13.259 --> 00:54:15.781]  Let's go ahead and play part of the CBS news piece
[00:54:16.849 --> 00:54:19.750]  New York City Police proposed massive public snooping system.
[00:54:19.750 --> 00:54:20.871]  It's already in.
[00:54:20.871 --> 00:54:23.172]  Notice how they just say, oh, they'll keep your data.
[00:54:23.172 --> 00:54:26.813]  No, they're live-time scanning it, and it's all federal.
[00:54:26.813 --> 00:54:40.478]  Remember when you heard five years ago that, oh, $3 billion in new camera systems by the feds for New York, $2 billion for Boston, $600-something million for Dallas, $500-something million for San Antonio.
[00:54:40.478 --> 00:54:41.699]  Remember hearing all that?
[00:54:41.699 --> 00:54:41.759]  Oh,
[00:54:42.412 --> 00:54:48.049]  Tens of millions for new microphones, gunshot detectors, which are microphones.
[00:54:48.049 --> 00:54:50.096]  You actually read the federal grant for Austin.
[00:54:57.037 --> 00:54:59.638]  And your local police departments are being turned into intelligence agencies.
[00:54:59.638 --> 00:55:08.241]  Here's the New York CBS piece introducing you that it's escape from New York, that New York is to be a total control grid prison with every person entering being scanned and database.
[00:55:08.241 --> 00:55:09.021]  Here it is.
[00:55:09.021 --> 00:55:13.463]  NYPD is reportedly working on a plan to track every vehicle that enters Manhattan.
[00:55:13.463 --> 00:55:17.084]  Operation Sentinel is aimed at preventing terror attacks.
[00:55:17.084 --> 00:55:20.025]  CBS 2's Deborah Garcia has more live from lower Manhattan.
[00:55:20.025 --> 00:55:20.665]  Deborah, good morning.
[00:55:21.897 --> 00:55:22.637]  Good morning, Kate.
[00:55:22.637 --> 00:55:23.218]  That's right.
[00:55:23.218 --> 00:55:26.879]  Operation Sentinel is aimed at preventing another terror attack.
[00:55:26.879 --> 00:55:35.203]  With the use of cameras and radiation sensors, police reportedly plan to track anyone or anything suspicious entering Manhattan.
[00:55:36.198 --> 00:55:45.200]  The New York Police Department reportedly wants to photograph the license plates of every vehicle coming into Manhattan, and keep the image and information in a database.
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:50.382]  The plan is all part of Operation Sentinel, and is detailed in today's New York Times.
[00:55:50.382 --> 00:55:54.463]  The proposal is part of a multi-million dollar plan to secure Lower Manhattan.
[00:55:54.463 --> 00:55:57.804]  It includes cameras, license plate readers, and radiation detectors.
[00:55:58.524 --> 00:56:00.986]  They would be set up at seven vehicle crossings.
[00:56:00.986 --> 00:56:05.008]  The Brooklyn Battery, Holland, Lincoln, and Queens Midtown Tunnels.
[00:56:05.008 --> 00:56:09.011]  Also, the George Washington, Henry Hudson, and Triborough Bridges.
[00:56:09.011 --> 00:56:13.854]  And also smaller bridges, like the Willis Avenue and McCombs Dam Bridges.
[00:56:13.854 --> 00:56:18.096]  It is unclear exactly when Operation Sentinel would be... Okay, let me tell you when it's clear.
[00:56:18.096 --> 00:56:23.080]  It's already in place, and it costs billions, not millions, and it's a scanner.
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:23.320]  Here we go.

[00:57:38.636 --> 00:57:41.017]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:57:41.017 --> 00:57:43.798]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:57:50.265 --> 00:57:55.109]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:56.670]  You want answers?
[00:57:56.670 --> 00:57:58.251]  Well, so does he.
[00:57:58.251 --> 00:58:02.434]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:58:02.434 --> 00:58:09.119]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:58:09.119 --> 00:58:12.122]  New York City Police proposed massive public snooping system.
[00:58:12.122 --> 00:58:16.465]  Remember, when they propose something that's already in place, the whole country has this in place.
[00:58:16.465 --> 00:58:18.667]  With massive surveillance systems now prevalent in London,
[00:58:20.183 --> 00:58:23.965]  Burial place of George Orwell, America's Big Apple, is mulling its own Big Brother network.
[00:58:23.965 --> 00:58:25.905]  It's not mulling it, it's done.
[00:58:25.905 --> 00:58:38.111]  In a proposal by Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, Operational Sentinel would create a technology surveillance veil that scans license plates and photographs vehicles as they cross all bridges at all entrances and exits, all tunnels.
[00:58:38.111 --> 00:58:43.833]  Then they mix in radiological detectors, which sound reasonable, into that to then legitimize the previous thing.
[00:58:44.713 --> 00:58:45.154]  We're good to go.
[00:58:59.947 --> 00:59:02.229]  Those are the centers running everything, scanning everything.
[00:59:02.229 --> 00:59:04.732]  Those are the CIA bases in your cities.
[00:59:04.732 --> 00:59:08.655]  In all, some 3,000 public and private security cameras would be deployed.
[00:59:08.655 --> 00:59:11.938]  This is just a planning document, said Paul J. Browning.
[00:59:11.938 --> 00:59:13.520]  That's the neutralized resistance.
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:15.602]  A police spokesman to the New York Times.
[00:59:15.602 --> 00:59:19.065]  It's a vision of how it will work if all the components come together.
[00:59:19.065 --> 00:59:20.987]  It's already in place, hooked into FEMA.
[00:59:20.987 --> 00:59:23.449]  They're now just training the local police to oversee it themselves.
[00:59:24.921 --> 00:59:32.108]  Data collected by the snooping would be stored in the International Security Agency and relayed through the command center in Lower Manhattan.
[00:59:32.108 --> 00:59:35.911]  In all, some 3,000 public and private security cameras would be deployed.
[00:59:35.911 --> 00:59:37.553]  This is just a planning document.
[00:59:37.553 --> 00:59:40.075]  Again, total bull.
[00:59:40.075 --> 00:59:44.359]  Meanwhile, a little further along in introducing the slaves to their new grid that they live under,
[00:59:46.494 --> 00:59:56.340]  Local governments, health authorities, and hundreds of other public bodies are to be given the power to access details of everyone's personal, text, emails, and internet use under Home Office proposals published yesterday.
[00:59:56.340 --> 01:00:07.526]  Ministers want to make it mandatory for telephone and internet companies to keep details of all personal internet traffic for at least 12 months so it can be accessed by investigators into crime or other threats to public safety.
[01:00:07.526 --> 01:00:12.429]  See, just total surveillance, total control, and it came out last year, well, we already knew.
[01:00:12.429 --> 01:00:14.590]  The Queen, through MI6, is illegally
[01:00:15.618 --> 01:00:25.613]  Spying on every member of Parliament with human intelligence people following them, and every cell phone, every email, every fax, home phones, 24 hours a day are listened to by personnel.
[01:00:25.613 --> 01:00:32.082]  All the major parties, the four major parties in England, everyone is surveilled by the criminal government, the illegitimate government.
[01:00:32.771 --> 01:00:34.712]  The elected governments are spied on.
[01:00:34.712 --> 01:00:36.453]  They're having their authority removed.
[01:00:36.453 --> 01:00:43.298]  Militarized, black-op command bases are being built in every city of Europe, England, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand.
[01:00:43.298 --> 01:00:46.380]  China's putting in similar centralized control systems.
[01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:47.460]  This is martial law.
[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:49.001]  This is dictatorship.
[01:00:49.001 --> 01:00:55.265]  Scientifically, with crafting and with love and with time, is being put in everywhere.
[01:00:58.428 --> 01:00:59.269]  It's outrageous.
[01:00:59.269 --> 01:01:02.230]  Let's play that clip again because we didn't finish it earlier.
[01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:03.711]  Go ahead and play it again.
[01:01:03.711 --> 01:01:08.174]  NYPD is reportedly working on a plan to track every vehicle that enters Manhattan.
[01:01:08.174 --> 01:01:11.796]  Operation Sentinel is aimed at preventing terror attacks.
[01:01:11.796 --> 01:01:14.738]  CBS 2's Deborah Garcia has more live from lower Manhattan.
[01:01:14.738 --> 01:01:15.358]  Deborah, good morning.
[01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:17.350]  Good morning, Kate.
[01:01:17.350 --> 01:01:17.931]  That's right.
[01:01:17.931 --> 01:01:21.572]  Operation Sentinel is aimed at preventing another terror attack.
[01:01:21.572 --> 01:01:29.916]  With the use of cameras and radiation sensors, police reportedly plan to track anyone or anything suspicious entering Manhattan.
[01:01:30.908 --> 01:01:39.912]  The New York Police Department reportedly wants to photograph the license plates of every vehicle coming into Manhattan and keep the image and information in a database.
[01:01:39.912 --> 01:01:45.094]  The plan is all part of Operation Sentinel and is detailed in today's New York Times.
[01:01:45.094 --> 01:01:49.175]  The proposal is part of a multi-million dollar plan to secure Lower Manhattan.
[01:01:49.175 --> 01:01:52.517]  It includes cameras, license plate readers, and radiation detectors.
[01:01:53.237 --> 01:02:08.542]  They would be set up at seven vehicle crossings, the Brooklyn Battery, Holland, Lincoln, and Queens Midtown Tunnels, also the George Washington, Henry Hudson, and Triborough Bridges, and also smaller bridges like the Willis Avenue and McCombs Dam Bridges.
[01:02:08.542 --> 01:02:18.485]  It is unclear exactly when Operation Sentinel would be complete, but the Lower Manhattan Initiative, part of the plan to secure the city's financial area, is expected to be in place by 2010.
[01:02:21.665 --> 01:02:29.411]  And if after a month your license plate number is of no use to them, the police will reportedly delete it.
[01:02:29.411 --> 01:02:30.192]  Oh, no use to them.
[01:02:30.192 --> 01:02:30.913]  No Fourth Amendment.
[01:02:30.913 --> 01:02:39.720]  Now remember, when you get a rent car, fly on a plane, buy gas, the Repatriate Act, all that's already uploaded so they can track everywhere you are at every time.
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:41.081]  Also tracking you by the cell phone.
[01:02:41.081 --> 01:02:43.363]  This is a military supremacist grid.
[01:02:46.209 --> 01:02:50.733]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:02:50.733 --> 01:02:55.818]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:02:55.818 --> 01:02:57.339]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:02:57.339 --> 01:03:00.942]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[01:03:45.853 --> 01:03:48.035]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[01:03:48.035 --> 01:03:50.417]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:03:50.417 --> 01:03:52.678]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:03:52.678 --> 01:03:54.280]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:55.941]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:03:55.941 --> 01:03:58.843]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:03:58.843 --> 01:04:02.486]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the bilateral commission, the CFR?
[01:04:12.117 --> 01:04:16.985]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:04:20.783 --> 01:04:24.864]  How dare you?
[01:04:24.864 --> 01:04:28.465]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:04:28.465 --> 01:04:31.186]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:04:31.186 --> 01:04:37.667]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9- Truth Rising.

[01:04:46.647 --> 01:04:51.931]  How much longer will you ignore the warning signs?
[01:04:51.931 --> 01:04:56.294]  How much longer will you turn away like a blind man?
[01:04:56.294 --> 01:05:01.237]  The choice of life or death, abundance or starvation is made today.

[01:05:32.505 --> 01:05:36.648]  Slaves hesitate.
[01:05:36.648 --> 01:05:39.890]  Soon we'll know which one you are.
[01:05:39.890 --> 01:05:42.771]  You have no more excuses.
[01:05:42.771 --> 01:05:51.297]  Survivalistseeds.com The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:05:51.297 --> 01:05:53.578]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:06:09.634 --> 01:06:16.936]  We are scheduled later in the next hour to have a surprise guest in studio.
[01:06:16.936 --> 01:06:22.877]  I want to talk about the new film, Fabled Enemies, and what is already a controversial trailer.
[01:06:22.877 --> 01:06:27.138]  Trailer number two, Fabled Enemies, Israeli operatives trailer two.
[01:06:27.138 --> 01:06:28.719]  The first trailer's out, now the second trailer's out.
[01:06:28.719 --> 01:06:32.080]  We're gonna have a third trailer that's gonna come out two days before the film's release, September 1st.
[01:06:33.533 --> 01:06:41.215]  Pre-orders for the DVD start in just a couple days, but let me get back into this control grid.
[01:06:41.215 --> 01:06:50.118]  Never before have criminal governments had so much power to track, trace, and shut off the ID cards under a new national sales tax they're pushing.
[01:06:50.118 --> 01:06:57.860]  They're already training you when you get cold medicine, or cigarettes, or beer, or now paints, and just hundreds of different items, demanding to see your ID.
[01:06:57.860 --> 01:07:03.222]  Major gas station chains and other stores are saying, retail stores are saying, oh, we want you to register your ID with us,
[01:07:03.872 --> 01:07:08.274]  Before you're allowed to use a credit card, or before you're allowed to get gas.
[01:07:08.274 --> 01:07:11.476]  This is the stated plan by the Rand Corporation and others.
[01:07:11.476 --> 01:07:17.759]  This is what the Ministry of Defense 10-year plan by the British put out last year, the declassified version over 100 pages.
[01:07:17.759 --> 01:07:33.107]  States, the military's job, and the surveillance crib's reason for existence is to control and dominate populations because they state they're going to destroy your standard of living, tax you at over 80%, regulate every form of your life, every facet of your life,
[01:07:33.647 --> 01:07:37.128]  Have one-child policies, eugenics, forced drugging.
[01:07:37.128 --> 01:07:38.509]  It's all happening.
[01:07:38.509 --> 01:07:46.811]  And they need this electronic straitjacket making the country a surveillance prison grid.
[01:07:46.811 --> 01:07:53.634]  Now, they can't have free speech while all of this is going on as well, can they?
[01:07:53.634 --> 01:08:00.616]  No, they can't have free speech in Europe, here in the United States, and they have used a cocktail
[01:08:02.183 --> 01:08:04.845]  Of different excuses.
[01:08:04.845 --> 01:08:09.889]  First, they arrive at something that everybody should agree with.
[01:08:09.889 --> 01:08:15.514]  We shouldn't allow white supremacists to talk bad about other racial groups in the EU.
[01:08:15.514 --> 01:08:16.875]  Doesn't that sound reasonable?
[01:08:16.875 --> 01:08:26.102]  Let's ban their free speech and give them, depending on the country, two to ten year prison sentences for all these different reasons.
[01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:30.166]  And then once that president said, oh, now have you criticized the EU and said bad things about it, or say,
[01:08:30.854 --> 01:08:35.016]  In a British grocery store, that we have better strawberries than, say, French strawberries.
[01:08:35.016 --> 01:08:36.597]  There was actually a case for that.
[01:08:36.597 --> 01:08:38.178]  Then you get fined or arrested.
[01:08:38.178 --> 01:08:45.462]  Or, if you're a BBC presenter, a rural affairs show called One Man and His Dog.
[01:08:45.462 --> 01:08:47.503]  Robin Page, we had on a few years ago.
[01:08:47.503 --> 01:08:50.685]  He got up at a council meeting before a thousand plus people and said, you know,
[01:08:51.650 --> 01:08:55.412]  Rural communities deserve the same rights as Muslims and homosexuals.
[01:08:55.412 --> 01:08:56.052]  And they arrested him.
[01:08:56.052 --> 01:08:57.653]  They said the word homosexual is hateful.
[01:08:57.653 --> 01:09:00.154]  It's a scientific term, like heterosexual, homosexual.
[01:09:00.154 --> 01:09:03.495]  But the public's so ignorant, they don't know that.
[01:09:03.495 --> 01:09:04.836]  And, uh, so they arrested him.
[01:09:04.836 --> 01:09:11.698]  They have, uh, snoop squads that go into restaurants to listen for racial slurs while people eat dinner, and you're arrested for that.
[01:09:11.698 --> 01:09:14.840]  BBC's reported it.
[01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:19.882]  So this is the control grid that they are putting in place, and now,
[01:09:21.081 --> 01:09:30.867]  Here in the United States, they are trying to implement similar things.
[01:09:30.867 --> 01:09:32.447]  So I want to shift gears into that.
[01:09:32.447 --> 01:09:37.550]  FCC Commissioner, Fairness Doctrine could lead to government regulation of the web.
[01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:40.652]  Top story, PrisonPlanet.com today.
[01:09:40.652 --> 01:09:49.257]  McDowell says, restrained reinstated powers could be
[01:09:50.109 --> 01:09:54.653]  Tagged on the net neutrality debate by leading Democrats.
[01:09:54.653 --> 01:09:57.936]  McDowell is the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.
[01:09:57.936 --> 01:10:09.466]  FCC Commissioner Robert McDowell says that the potential re-interdeduction of the Fairness Doctrine under the Democratic Administration could lead to government dissecting content policy on the Internet.
[01:10:09.466 --> 01:10:15.491]  The Fairness Doctrine was an FCC regulation mandating broadcasters afford time to opposing viewpoints.
[01:10:16.207 --> 01:10:22.209]  It was abolished in 1987 by the Supreme Court after it was found to be harmful to journalistic freedom and anathema to the First Amendment.
[01:10:22.209 --> 01:10:27.951]  Now they were able to carry this out because there was no really independent media in the 80s, in the 70s and 80s.
[01:10:27.951 --> 01:10:42.736]  Only a few dozen newspaper owners, less than a dozen TV network owners, and so they were already playing ball and they said, oh there's a law you can't even have a guest on who says I'm against gun control because then you have to give opposing time to someone who's for gun control.
[01:10:42.736 --> 01:10:44.257]  And it was all selectively enforced.
[01:10:45.859 --> 01:10:52.920]  Now, this ties into them trying to shut down the web, tax it, regulate it, end net neutrality.
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:56.701]  Again, that cocktail of ways they're doing this, and there's political correctness.
[01:10:56.701 --> 01:10:59.902]  The child draws a picture of their dad, the Marines with a gun, he's arrested.
[01:10:59.902 --> 01:11:08.844]  The Valedictorian on the last day of school brings a cake to their teacher for an after-school party, and the security guard walks in and there's a plastic box of Dixie knives, forks, and spoons.
[01:11:08.844 --> 01:11:09.464]  She's arrested.
[01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:12.012]  I mean, there's hundreds of those cases.
[01:11:12.012 --> 01:11:17.576]  Again, it's already there with the young people who can't defend themselves and have no idea about liberty and freedom.
[01:11:17.576 --> 01:11:21.460]  The young generation, the younger generation is already deeply under this.
[01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:29.527]  And they're trained how to tattle on their parents, how to spy on their parents.
[01:11:29.527 --> 01:11:31.408]  It goes on and on.
[01:11:31.408 --> 01:11:32.930]  So that's the whole Stasi grid going on.
[01:11:34.358 --> 01:11:36.719]  I think it won't be called the Fairness Doctrine by folks who are
[01:11:58.284 --> 01:12:03.649]  I think it'll be intertwined into the net neutrality debate.
[01:12:03.649 --> 01:12:06.931]  This is actually something we could have talked about in there.
[01:12:06.931 --> 01:12:14.577]  Because there are few isolated conservatives who might be cherry picked in the net neutrality effort.
[01:12:14.577 --> 01:12:24.786]  And I think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content, their points of view, right?
[01:12:27.207 --> 01:12:49.581]  I think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy, which by the way, we have a big First Amendment problem, then whoever's in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so-called fairness doctrine, which won't be called that, but it'll be called something else.
[01:12:49.581 --> 01:12:54.464]  So will websites, will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space?
[01:12:56.106 --> 01:12:56.526]  We're good.
[01:13:12.342 --> 01:13:19.288]  So there you have it, and that's when they're making their move on the web, announced by Internet2, the federal government, international agencies, international treaty.
[01:13:19.288 --> 01:13:21.469]  It's all hitting next year and the year after that.
[01:13:21.469 --> 01:13:23.211]  In fact, it's already hitting in Canada.
[01:13:23.211 --> 01:13:32.338]  They announced three weeks ago, the two largest telecoms that are over 80% of the market announced they will only allow you to visit a couple thousand websites instead of hundreds of millions of sites.
[01:13:32.338 --> 01:13:35.741]  In fact, there's billions of pages, but several hundred million sites.
[01:13:35.741 --> 01:13:38.103]  They said, no, it's gonna be like cable.
[01:13:38.103 --> 01:13:39.584]  You will not be allowed to visit other sites.
[01:13:41.053 --> 01:13:47.374]  Unless you pay for larger packages, and that's hijacking our content and basically stealing from the alternative media.
[01:13:47.374 --> 01:13:48.254]  But they have to do this.
[01:13:48.254 --> 01:13:49.915]  The mainline media is dying.
[01:13:49.915 --> 01:13:51.795]  The establishment's moving with its police state.
[01:13:51.795 --> 01:13:52.975]  The people see it.
[01:13:52.975 --> 01:13:55.196]  They've got to come in and try to shut this down.
[01:13:55.196 --> 01:13:56.516]  It'll all be selectively enforced.
[01:13:56.516 --> 01:13:57.236]  You heard him.
[01:13:57.236 --> 01:14:01.937]  The corporations will say, well, you can't make that comment on our ABC News message board.
[01:14:01.937 --> 01:14:04.218]  You can't make that on the Sean Hannity message board.
[01:14:04.218 --> 01:14:05.218]  You can't make a statement
[01:14:05.778 --> 01:14:15.721]  You know, on this side or that side, or InfoWars.com can't write this article, you know, and then we get sued by the government or get arrested because you're not letting other people have a side on there.
[01:14:15.721 --> 01:14:20.423]  It is just totally un-American, classical tyranny, and it's here!
[01:14:20.423 --> 01:14:23.564]  Just one more weapon in the arsenal.
[01:14:23.564 --> 01:14:34.527]  Now, the committees, Telecommunications Committee in the House and Senate, respectively, have been calling for the reintroduction of the Fairness Doctrine and a huge new federal regulatory body over this, and that dovetails
[01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:42.072]  With the Violent Radicalization Act, where they show architects and engineers for 9-11 Truth, who is saying it's government-sponsored.
[01:14:42.072 --> 01:14:47.854]  They're just showing the science of the buildings collapsing, with all these engineers and physicists and scientists.
[01:14:47.854 --> 01:14:53.656]  They introduced them in congressional hearings as a terrorist group.
[01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:55.856]  That needs to be regulated and shut down and controlled.
[01:14:55.856 --> 01:14:57.457]  I mean, this isn't a game, folks.
[01:14:57.457 --> 01:14:58.597]  This is really happening.
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:15.052]  I know it's hard to believe in the land of the free, home of the brave that this could be unfolding, but it's hard to believe that the land of the free, home of the brave would launch last Thursday night on the eve of the Olympics a U.S.-NATO, Israel-backed sneak attack on Russian troops and slaughtering them and more than 2,000 civilians.
[01:15:15.052 --> 01:15:20.116]  The number's gonna be well over 4,000, they're now reporting, as they dig people out of the rubble of Ossetia and surrounding towns.
[01:15:26.104 --> 01:15:40.497]  Also, the CIA, DARPA, the Advanced Research Laboratories, they created the net, and so they're just announcing they're going to shut off the pathways to alternative sites or foreign media sites, just like China does with firewalls.
[01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:42.361]  Keyword firewall.
[01:15:42.361 --> 01:15:48.924]  Same thing that Cisco and Oracle and the rest of them have helped design for China and other countries censoring.
[01:15:48.924 --> 01:15:50.384]  That's now being put in place here.
[01:15:50.384 --> 01:15:54.386]  Yahoo, Google, they're all putting in place, admittedly, and running it in China.
[01:15:54.386 --> 01:16:00.749]  They run it for the Chinese government and are paid for those services.
[01:16:00.749 --> 01:16:02.590]  And they shut down Russia today that Russia's
[01:16:03.419 --> 01:16:04.641]  Basically, they're CNN.
[01:16:04.641 --> 01:16:06.182]  They're English service.
[01:16:06.182 --> 01:16:08.185]  That was just shut down yesterday.
[01:16:08.185 --> 01:16:09.967]  Most people in the world couldn't get to it in the U.S.
[01:16:09.967 --> 01:16:10.728]  We couldn't get to it.
[01:16:10.728 --> 01:16:14.792]  We did a story up on PrisonPlanet.com about that.
[01:16:14.792 --> 01:16:16.594]  We're covering the most important issues.
[01:16:16.594 --> 01:16:19.618]  We're tracking and chronicling the New World Order's activities.
[01:16:21.923 --> 01:16:28.967]  And we need good police chiefs, good sheriffs, good county commissioners, good governors, if there are any left, and legislatures to say no to all this.
[01:16:28.967 --> 01:16:36.250]  But the Texas legislature says you're not going to take over existing roads and give them to foreign companies and tax people when we've already paid for it.
[01:16:36.250 --> 01:16:38.831]  And Perry says, I don't care what you say, I'm going to do it.
[01:16:38.831 --> 01:16:43.074]  And then when states start saying no, Bush comes in with an executive order two weeks ago.
[01:16:43.074 --> 01:16:49.777]  Wall Street Journal reported saying, I, through executive order, if you take federal funds for highways, I'm going to force you to give this over to foreign interest.
[01:16:52.918 --> 01:17:09.382]  Just like the Boxer Rebellion, you know, was triggered with China broken into 10 major parts, really about 20 if you counted some sub-regions, and Russia, the US, England, Germany, France, Belgium, the Dutch, they all just moved in and broke China up in pieces and did the same thing.
[01:17:09.382 --> 01:17:15.004]  They bankrupted them with loans, came in, militarily took over.
[01:17:15.004 --> 01:17:19.705]  Then when that didn't work, they created the Communists as a client state, as a client government to work with.
[01:17:19.705 --> 01:17:20.645]  They're doing that here!
[01:17:21.892 --> 01:17:23.233]  You look at how they broke up China.
[01:17:23.233 --> 01:17:25.174]  They're doing that to us.
[01:17:25.174 --> 01:17:27.075]  Because they don't want us to be a lone superpower.
[01:17:27.075 --> 01:17:28.816]  They don't want us to be a free nation.
[01:17:28.816 --> 01:17:33.880]  We're being absorbed into world government.
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:44.767]  Now, when we get back, when we get back, I'm going to break down the Israeli connection to 9-11 that we've covered ad nauseum with other guests, though folks deny it.
[01:17:44.767 --> 01:17:45.387]  We're going to come back.
[01:17:45.387 --> 01:17:46.868]  We have the new trailer up on InfoWars.com.
[01:17:47.620 --> 01:17:49.362]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:17:49.362 --> 01:17:49.622]  August 13, 2008.
[01:17:49.622 --> 01:17:50.263]  Gold opened at $820.80.
[01:17:50.263 --> 01:17:53.646]  One ounce gold coins can be purchased for $845.38, $416.60 for half ounce, and $208.30 for quarter ounce.
[01:17:53.646 --> 01:17:54.006]  That's $845.38, $416.60, and $208.30.
[01:18:04.184 --> 01:18:06.746]  Hedge funds caught in the malaise of mortgage bankruptcies.
[01:18:06.746 --> 01:18:08.587]  The bond market continues to slump.
[01:18:08.587 --> 01:18:11.750]  JP Morgan gets caught in a $10 billion bad deal for Chrysler.
[01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:13.891]  Housing sales fell 6.6%.
[01:18:13.891 --> 01:18:18.534]  Mortgage giant Countrywide showed mortgage payment woes spreading to the middle and upper class.
[01:18:18.534 --> 01:18:20.936]  Investors cast doubt on investment banks.
[01:18:20.936 --> 01:18:25.259]  Credit protection insurance for mortgage lenders are skyrocketing due to the increased risk.
[01:18:25.259 --> 01:18:25.700]  The U.S.
[01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:29.883]  dollar is free-falling against foreign currencies and countries that previously financed the U.S.
[01:18:29.883 --> 01:18:31.564]  are now seeking safer alternatives.
[01:18:31.844 --> 01:18:34.687]  Economist Rudy Boyd published the report, Bubble Leaking.
[01:18:34.687 --> 01:18:35.929]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[01:18:35.929 --> 01:18:41.255]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[01:18:41.255 --> 01:18:41.515]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:18:41.515 --> 01:18:41.695]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:18:47.333 --> 01:18:51.094]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[01:18:51.094 --> 01:18:56.135]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[01:18:56.135 --> 01:19:01.596]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[01:19:01.596 --> 01:19:12.078]  Though the people of the U.S., where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reigning them in and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[01:19:12.578 --> 01:19:16.979]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[01:19:16.979 --> 01:19:19.760]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:23.320]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:35.843]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the Earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.

[01:19:49.389 --> 01:19:51.530]  Don't let yourself become a statistic.
[01:19:51.530 --> 01:19:52.390]  Be smart.

[01:20:48.042 --> 01:20:51.665]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:20:51.665 --> 01:20:54.126]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:20:54.126 --> 01:20:57.148]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:20:57.148 --> 01:21:02.891]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:21:02.891 --> 01:21:06.794]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:21:07.134 --> 01:21:12.336]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[01:21:12.336 --> 01:21:15.377]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[01:21:44.214 --> 01:21:44.954]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:22:12.874 --> 01:22:18.356]  I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing till they got a hold of me.
[01:22:18.356 --> 01:22:23.478]  I opened doors for little old ladies.
[01:22:23.478 --> 01:22:27.680]  I helped the blind to see.
[01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:32.121]  I got no friends cause they read the papers.
[01:22:32.121 --> 01:22:33.462]  They can't be seen.
[01:22:42.597 --> 01:22:55.704]  That goes for all the enemies of liberty and all of my enemies.
[01:22:55.704 --> 01:22:58.466]  No more Mr. Nice Guy.
[01:22:58.466 --> 01:23:02.368]  People have been accusing me of not being a nice guy.
[01:23:02.368 --> 01:23:03.469]  Well, I'm going to show you.
[01:23:13.937 --> 01:23:17.159]  We're good to go.
[01:23:36.769 --> 01:23:46.536]  It's up on InfoWars.com, in the Featured Stories section, Fabled Enemies, Israeli Operatives, TrailerTube.
[01:23:46.536 --> 01:23:50.519]  Go ahead and roll it, John.
[01:23:50.519 --> 01:23:58.926]  Fox News has learned that some American terrorism investigators fear certain suspects in the September 11th attacks may have managed to stay ahead of them.
[01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.470]  Some U.S.
[01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:06.553]  investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:24:06.553 --> 01:24:13.696]  Whether it's because they're in intelligence services or what they were doing, I will defer to the Department of Justice and the FBI.
[01:24:13.696 --> 01:24:19.979]  There was a report on the George Washington Bridge that there had been a van stop there that had explosives.
[01:24:19.979 --> 01:24:23.761]  We have the suspect to admit from going in the van that that exploded.
[01:24:26.159 --> 01:24:31.140]  MDOX Limited, an Israeli-based private telecommunications company.
[01:24:31.140 --> 01:24:37.422]  It is virtually impossible to make a call on normal phones without generating an MDOX record of it.
[01:24:37.422 --> 01:24:42.924]  It quickly unraveled to be the largest foreign spy ring ever uncovered inside the United States.
[01:24:42.924 --> 01:24:44.024]  The largest.
[01:24:44.024 --> 01:24:52.346]  Documents say they, quote, targeted and penetrated military bases, the DEA, FBI, and dozens of other government facilities.
[01:24:52.346 --> 01:24:54.487]  There's one big elephant in the living room.
[01:24:55.862 --> 01:25:01.083]  It is the relationship between the United States of America and the State of Israel.
[01:25:01.083 --> 01:25:04.824]  What about this question of advanced knowledge of what was going to happen on 9-11?
[01:25:04.824 --> 01:25:07.405]  Well, it's very explosive information, obviously.
[01:25:07.405 --> 01:25:10.666]  A bigger question, they say, is how could they not have known?
[01:25:10.666 --> 01:25:18.588]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, fabled enemies.
[01:25:20.345 --> 01:25:21.906]  ...is the new film by Jason Burmess.
[01:25:21.906 --> 01:25:26.289]  Now, just three years ago, Dylan Avery made Loose Change, the first cut.
[01:25:26.289 --> 01:25:28.491]  It was only out a few months.
[01:25:28.491 --> 01:25:36.756]  Then he made the second edition, and then finally, about nine months ago, we released Final Cut.
[01:25:36.756 --> 01:25:41.580]  Burmess has always wanted to make this film, but he wasn't the writer or director.
[01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:42.821]  This is Burmess's film.
[01:25:42.821 --> 01:25:46.603]  People said, well, why didn't you cover this seven years ago, six and a half years ago?
[01:25:46.603 --> 01:25:47.624]  Well, actually, my film
[01:25:48.476 --> 01:25:54.621]  Masters of Terror does cover the Israeli connection, and the Odigo Instant Message Company warning, and all of it.
[01:25:54.621 --> 01:25:56.503]  In fact, Road to Tyranny covers that.
[01:25:56.503 --> 01:25:58.885]  So, actually, I did cover it six and a half years ago.
[01:25:58.885 --> 01:26:02.008]  I have not just only focused in on the Israeli connection.
[01:26:02.008 --> 01:26:06.571]  I mean, there's no degrees of separation between British, U.S., and Israeli intelligence.
[01:26:06.571 --> 01:26:07.372]  They're all guilty.
[01:26:07.372 --> 01:26:08.593]  They're all involved.
[01:26:08.593 --> 01:26:13.437]  The prime director, obviously, is Dick Cheney and those above him, and private defense contractors.
[01:26:13.437 --> 01:26:15.479]  But it's like five guys robbing a bank.
[01:26:15.479 --> 01:26:16.680]  All five are just as guilty.
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:20.925]  For us to give you the big picture and cover it all is not holding back on Israel.
[01:26:20.925 --> 01:26:22.486]  But regardless, we've done this.
[01:26:22.486 --> 01:26:23.668]  We're Big Fish.
[01:26:23.668 --> 01:26:25.029]  I produced this film.
[01:26:25.029 --> 01:26:26.211]  I put this out.
[01:26:26.211 --> 01:26:27.352]  And we're going to take the heat for it.
[01:26:27.998 --> 01:26:34.061]  And I knew I'd get heat from one side saying, you know, that we're just bashing Israel, but I wanted to see what the other side would do.
[01:26:34.061 --> 01:26:41.324]  And of course, they're freaking out even more angry because they have it wrong about this show and who we are and what we stand for.
[01:26:41.324 --> 01:26:43.265]  And they can't admit we're good guys.
[01:26:43.265 --> 01:26:45.286]  They can't admit we cover what's going on.
[01:26:45.286 --> 01:26:48.428]  You know, we cover Vatican corruption with countless gifts.
[01:26:48.428 --> 01:26:48.908]  Doesn't matter.
[01:26:48.908 --> 01:26:50.829]  They lie and say we never covered it.
[01:26:50.829 --> 01:26:52.730]  We cover Israeli corruption, Israeli terror.
[01:26:53.248 --> 01:27:01.173]  I've got three films with whole sections about Israel staging terror attacks, Israel's state, no, four films, Israel staging the attack on the USS Liberty.
[01:27:01.173 --> 01:27:08.137]  My detractors say, nope, he's never covered it, never talked about it.
[01:27:08.137 --> 01:27:11.739]  Or they will misrepresent and say, oh, he says LBJ did the attack, not Israel.
[01:27:11.739 --> 01:27:14.601]  No, our federal government was involved with Israel.
[01:27:14.601 --> 01:27:17.022]  Both co-equal in guilt.
[01:27:17.856 --> 01:27:19.917]  It doesn't give Israel cover.
[01:27:19.917 --> 01:27:21.458]  It shows the larger picture.
[01:27:21.458 --> 01:27:23.058]  And that's what we strive to do here.
[01:27:23.058 --> 01:27:24.979]  So I'm going to keep breaking this down.
[01:27:24.979 --> 01:27:27.880]  On the other side, fabled enemies.
[01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:36.384]  It's only about 15 days until it's released, ladies and gentlemen, at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:27:36.384 --> 01:27:37.785]  We're on the march.
[01:27:37.785 --> 01:27:40.326]  The empire's on the run.
[01:27:40.326 --> 01:27:43.007]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:27:46.192 --> 01:27:49.575]  Alabama state code makes it illegal to drive barefoot.
[01:27:49.575 --> 01:27:53.278]  In Downey, California, it's illegal to wash your car in the street.
[01:27:53.278 --> 01:27:57.362]  In Minnesota, you can be fined for displaying that your vehicle is for sale.
[01:27:57.362 --> 01:28:02.066]  These laws are obviously not made to protect us, but instead to help states profit.
[01:28:02.066 --> 01:28:04.868]  The use of red light cameras is another great example.
[01:28:04.868 --> 01:28:10.033]  They intrude on your privacy, are unconstitutional, and cost you valuable time and money.
[01:28:10.493 --> 01:28:17.156]  SprayYourPlate.com is a spray-on photo blocker that protects against red light cameras, toll cameras, and speed cameras.
[01:28:17.156 --> 01:28:23.179]  One application lasts a lifetime, is undetectable, and each can covers up to four license plates.
[01:28:23.179 --> 01:28:26.141]  Simply spray it on, let it dry, and you're protected.
[01:28:26.141 --> 01:28:32.664]  All orders are kept strictly confidential, and for the month of August, receive free shipping and a $5 bill enclosed with every order.

[01:28:33.504 --> 01:28:38.888]  That's 1-800-276-9601.
[01:28:38.888 --> 01:28:41.229]  Or go to SprayYourPlate.com.
[01:28:41.229 --> 01:28:42.990]  That's SprayYourPlate.com.
[01:28:42.990 --> 01:28:44.671]  Don't give your money to the state.
[01:28:44.671 --> 01:28:46.052]  Spray your plate.
[01:28:46.052 --> 01:28:49.474]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[01:28:49.474 --> 01:28:51.795]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[01:28:51.795 --> 01:28:55.097]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[01:28:55.097 --> 01:29:01.521]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[01:29:01.961 --> 01:29:04.563]  Online from my desk with Webex.
[01:29:04.563 --> 01:29:07.865]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[01:29:07.865 --> 01:29:12.648]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[01:29:12.648 --> 01:29:16.590]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[01:29:16.590 --> 01:29:18.211]  Travel less, meet online.
[01:29:18.211 --> 01:29:20.873]  Go to Webex.com and try Webex free.
[01:29:20.873 --> 01:29:26.776]  Just click the radiographic and enter promo code 500 to get a free trial and a free webcam too.
[01:29:26.776 --> 01:29:27.577]  Remember that code 500.
[01:29:28.097 --> 01:29:30.839]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[01:29:30.839 --> 01:29:31.660]  And we knew what to do.
[01:29:53.991 --> 01:29:55.273]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:29:55.273 --> 01:30:02.325]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:30:02.325 --> 01:30:07.494]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement.
[01:30:08.444 --> 01:30:11.206]  That the air was safe to breathe.
[01:30:11.206 --> 01:30:18.311]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:30:18.311 --> 01:30:21.494]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:30:21.494 --> 01:30:27.258]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:30:27.258 --> 01:30:29.840]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:30:30.321 --> 01:30:36.390]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:39.314]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:30:39.314 --> 01:30:44.222]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[01:30:58.519 --> 01:31:24.131]  Cyrus Jones from 1810 to 1913 Made his great-grandchildren believe you could live to 103 103 is forever when you're just a little kid So, Cyrus Jones, live forever Grave digger, when you dig my grave
[01:31:25.399 --> 01:31:30.543]  Could you make it shallow so I can feel the rain?
[01:31:30.543 --> 01:31:32.044]  Mural Stonewall, 1903 to 1954
[01:31:45.832 --> 01:31:51.074]  She lost both of her babies in the Second Great War.
[01:31:51.074 --> 01:31:56.537]  Now you should never have to watch your only children lowered in the ground.
[01:31:56.537 --> 01:32:01.199]  You should never have to bury your own babies.
[01:32:01.199 --> 01:32:08.842]  Crazy digger, when you dig my grave, could you make it shallow?
[01:32:29.486 --> 01:32:41.772]  Who you are is what you do and what you stand for.
[01:32:41.772 --> 01:32:50.457]  We're meant to communicate with future generations by our words and deeds.
[01:32:50.457 --> 01:32:51.777]  We're meant to build a better world.
[01:32:54.053 --> 01:32:56.355]  For our species.
[01:32:56.355 --> 01:33:00.399]  Through our species we have a potential to live forever.
[01:33:00.399 --> 01:33:06.325]  There is no doubting that fact.
[01:33:06.325 --> 01:33:06.966]  Life is not the...
[01:33:12.344 --> 01:33:13.725]  Pursuit of things.
[01:33:13.725 --> 01:33:18.348]  It is the pursuit of ideas.
[01:33:18.348 --> 01:33:21.790]  And life is a test.
[01:33:21.790 --> 01:33:23.991]  A journey.
[01:33:23.991 --> 01:33:27.874]  Will you pass that test?
[01:33:27.874 --> 01:33:31.036]  Will you live a life of substance?
[01:33:31.036 --> 01:33:35.739]  A life of honor?
[01:33:35.739 --> 01:33:38.961]  Or will you be deceived?
[01:33:38.961 --> 01:33:40.562]  Will you be a child of the dark side?
[01:33:41.896 --> 01:33:44.939]  Or a child of the light.
[01:33:44.939 --> 01:33:50.084]  Brave digger.
[01:33:59.058 --> 01:34:02.420]  I say live life every day realizing how short it is.
[01:34:02.420 --> 01:34:08.864]  How fragile it is.
[01:34:08.864 --> 01:34:11.686]  Grave Digger.
[01:34:11.686 --> 01:34:18.110]  Lee Nelson, Grave Digger, off his new album.
[01:34:18.110 --> 01:34:24.254]  By the way, just a tidbit, that anti-war rally, the date is set
[01:34:25.251 --> 01:34:32.977]  I got so much going on, finishing another film with Burmese and doing hundreds of other things and doing all these radio interviews, which I've got to start refusing to do.
[01:34:32.977 --> 01:34:35.279]  I just can't operate or live.
[01:34:35.279 --> 01:34:38.021]  I'm doing so many interviews, but I'm not whining.
[01:34:38.021 --> 01:34:39.982]  It's just that then I don't do the best job at a lot of other things.
[01:34:39.982 --> 01:34:51.011]  I want to get back into Israel and 9-11 in a minute, but by the end of the show today, we're going to post on InfoWars.com the winner of the first wave of contest.
[01:34:51.011 --> 01:34:52.012]  To be clear, there's a $2,000 contest.
[01:34:55.399 --> 01:34:59.101]  For the best censorship video showing how the web is being censored.
[01:34:59.101 --> 01:35:03.863]  And then a 1,000 prize for the best Truth Rising trailer fan trailer.
[01:35:03.863 --> 01:35:05.744]  And I said the last day to have those in was Sunday.
[01:35:05.744 --> 01:35:07.065]  I said I'd announce it Monday.
[01:35:07.065 --> 01:35:11.747]  But I've been so busy, there's been so many hundreds of entries, I can't even keep track of it.
[01:35:11.747 --> 01:35:14.528]  I'm trying, last night for hours I watched them.
[01:35:14.528 --> 01:35:18.190]  After I was here finishing up trailers with Burmese, I went home and watched more.
[01:35:18.190 --> 01:35:19.971]  Uh, this morning I got up early and was watching them.
[01:35:19.971 --> 01:35:23.633]  Didn't even exercise, you know, that little bit of time I have to just watch more of these.
[01:35:24.495 --> 01:35:26.015]  I've chosen the winners.
[01:35:26.015 --> 01:35:28.436]  Kurt's writing a little article about it right now.
[01:35:28.436 --> 01:35:33.817]  And it really shocked me that in the comment section it's like, Alex, what's your problem?
[01:35:33.817 --> 01:35:35.798]  First you said it was a $5,000 prize.
[01:35:35.798 --> 01:35:37.338]  Now you're saying it's a $2,000 prize.
[01:35:37.338 --> 01:35:37.778]  What is it?
[01:35:37.778 --> 01:35:38.899]  No, no, no.
[01:35:38.899 --> 01:35:41.699]  There's two waves of prizes.
[01:35:41.699 --> 01:35:43.780]  And I'm sorry we weren't properly clear about all that.
[01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:45.980]  There's another contest coming up the 19th.
[01:35:45.980 --> 01:35:50.481]  And I'm leaving town the 21st to go to Denver, so I'll have to announce on the 20th there.
[01:35:50.481 --> 01:35:52.582]  I just want to try to judge these properly.
[01:35:54.099 --> 01:35:55.800]  You know, I mean, I came up with the idea.
[01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:57.441]  I'm giving out cash prizes.
[01:35:57.441 --> 01:36:00.842]  The whole point's to expose Internet censorship.
[01:36:00.842 --> 01:36:02.143]  And I know I'm not perfect, man.
[01:36:02.143 --> 01:36:03.144]  I'm overwhelmed.
[01:36:03.144 --> 01:36:04.044]  I'm not perfect.
[01:36:04.044 --> 01:36:04.864]  I'm not a god.
[01:36:04.864 --> 01:36:07.886]  I don't have it all together.
[01:36:07.886 --> 01:36:11.928]  For our special guest that's scheduled to be showing up in here, you know, last night, you know who the mate is?
[01:36:11.928 --> 01:36:12.908]  Alex Jones.
[01:36:12.908 --> 01:36:15.330]  Cleared my papers off my glass desk in here.
[01:36:15.330 --> 01:36:17.571]  Got Windex out.
[01:36:17.571 --> 01:36:17.991]  Cleaned it.
[01:36:19.514 --> 01:36:21.054]  Cleaned the office last night.
[01:36:21.054 --> 01:36:23.875]  I cleaned the office while I was working on the trailer.
[01:36:23.875 --> 01:36:27.115]  Well, then I went home and tried to judge your trailers, and I'm not whining!
[01:36:27.115 --> 01:36:29.156]  Just give me a little bit of leeway.
[01:36:29.156 --> 01:36:33.816]  Give me a little... Hey, folks, I put the toilet paper on the rolls around here.
[01:36:33.816 --> 01:36:40.978]  I... Had to, you know, we were going out yesterday, because the maid service comes twice a week here in the office, but they don't clean off my desk, because it's always a mess.
[01:36:40.978 --> 01:36:43.538]  Uh, I don't want to dig into my papers.
[01:36:43.538 --> 01:36:46.219]  But, uh, you know, I ran out and got the plastic bags for them we were out.
[01:36:46.219 --> 01:36:48.899]  I mean, I'm just an average person, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:49.611 --> 01:36:51.972]  People expect so much of us.
[01:36:51.972 --> 01:36:59.395]  You expect that I'm some superhero and I'm not, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:59.395 --> 01:37:07.578]  I don't mean to get off on a diatribe.
[01:37:07.578 --> 01:37:08.839]  I am exhausted sometimes.
[01:37:08.839 --> 01:37:10.860]  It's just there's so much.
[01:37:10.860 --> 01:37:14.741]  Trying to administrate just 15 employees is a nightmare.
[01:37:14.741 --> 01:37:16.082]  And I'm not whining.
[01:37:16.082 --> 01:37:16.822]  I'm just saying
[01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:25.583]  I remember when before I knew Hollywood people and music stars and politicians, I thought they were like gods and floated around on cloud nine and were superhuman.
[01:37:25.583 --> 01:37:30.926]  Now that I know a lot of these people over the last six, seven, eight years, I know that's not the case.
[01:37:30.926 --> 01:37:35.948]  Now that I run a business, now that I deal with all this, I understand, folks, how hard life is.
[01:37:35.948 --> 01:37:40.830]  And I think for a lot of you out there who work nine to fives, you have no idea what it's like to be in an administrative position.
[01:37:41.812 --> 01:37:42.873]  And you have no idea.
[01:37:42.873 --> 01:37:44.976]  I mean, and I don't claim to be good at all this.
[01:37:44.976 --> 01:37:48.821]  We churn out the most films, the most videos, the most radio shows.
[01:37:48.821 --> 01:37:58.974]  We're the most innovative in this movement, and that isn't saying much.
[01:37:58.974 --> 01:38:00.096]  That is not saying much.
[01:38:01.460 --> 01:38:09.704]  And I'm exhilarated with all that's happening in the world, but this whole Russia sneak attack thing with the Georgians sneak attacking them, U.S.-backed, has exhausted me covering that.
[01:38:09.704 --> 01:38:15.206]  I probably added two, three hours of research a day to my five, six, seven hours of research on top of everything.
[01:38:15.206 --> 01:38:18.448]  I mean, sleep misses out.
[01:38:18.448 --> 01:38:25.471]  I literally am so alive fighting so hard that I do not get sleep.
[01:38:25.471 --> 01:38:27.832]  And I just get enraged with frustration.
[01:38:29.781 --> 01:38:33.495]  When people expect the impossible from me.
[01:38:33.495 --> 01:38:34.017]  Do this!
[01:38:34.017 --> 01:38:34.579]  Do that!
[01:38:34.579 --> 01:38:35.422]  Do a better job here!
[01:38:35.422 --> 01:38:36.185]  Do a better job there!
[01:38:39.691 --> 01:38:40.371]  It's the same thing.
[01:38:40.371 --> 01:38:42.032]  We cover corruption in every group.
[01:38:42.032 --> 01:38:47.413]  China, Russia, every religious group, the Vatican, Muslims, Protestant groups.
[01:38:47.413 --> 01:38:52.115]  We cover it all, but we don't hone in and focus in on only one group.
[01:38:52.115 --> 01:38:56.676]  We focus the corruption that is in humanity, the good, the bad, and the ugly.
[01:38:56.676 --> 01:38:57.796]  Every group does evil.
[01:38:57.796 --> 01:38:58.757]  Every group does bad.
[01:38:58.757 --> 01:38:59.977]  And because I say that,
[01:39:00.959 --> 01:39:10.685]  Because I won't say the center of all evil is in Israel, the center of all evil is in the Vatican, or the center of all evil is the evil whitey or the evil black person.
[01:39:10.685 --> 01:39:14.828]  You know, all these groups say it's always one group.
[01:39:14.828 --> 01:39:16.489]  And are some groups more dominant than others?
[01:39:16.489 --> 01:39:18.851]  Do some groups have been more successful at evil and oppression?
[01:39:18.851 --> 01:39:19.651]  Yes.
[01:39:19.651 --> 01:39:25.195]  But does that mean that one group needs to be singled out as a source of all evil?
[01:39:25.195 --> 01:39:25.295]  No.
[01:39:26.661 --> 01:39:32.243]  Conversely, though, on the subject of Israel, it is one of the most wicked nations on Earth.
[01:39:32.243 --> 01:39:48.269]  I'd have to say North Korea, the U.S., Mexico, England, Saudi Arabia... Those are some of the most wicked countries on Earth.
[01:39:48.269 --> 01:39:49.889]  I'm not against Mexicans.
[01:39:49.889 --> 01:39:51.230]  I'm not against British.
[01:39:51.230 --> 01:39:52.330]  I'm not against Chinese.
[01:39:52.330 --> 01:39:54.771]  I'm not against... I'm against corruption and
[01:39:58.942 --> 01:40:25.375]  For me to make... Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Martial Law, Terror Storm, all with large sections on Israel-sponsored terror, where the Jerusalem Post, Haratch, others admit they staged terror attacks, created fake Al-Qaeda groups, uh, created... Hamas... I just show it!
[01:40:26.517 --> 01:40:29.058]  I showed it when Israel warned their people to get out of the building.
[01:40:29.058 --> 01:40:30.618]  It was in Israeli papers.
[01:40:30.618 --> 01:40:32.318]  I did cover all that.
[01:40:32.318 --> 01:40:44.081]  I just have not made it my sole, complete, total mission to only sit there and cover that.
[01:40:44.081 --> 01:40:50.082]  The most incredible thing is every time I talk about Israel and the corruption and the evil and the things that government's doing,
[01:40:51.676 --> 01:40:57.979]  People take clips of the radio show and put it on YouTube and the web and say that, oh, this was Alex behind the scenes.
[01:40:57.979 --> 01:40:59.680]  That Alex was caught off guard.
[01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:01.281]  This isn't his radio show.
[01:41:01.281 --> 01:41:04.062]  This is him secretly behind the scenes admitting he knows all this.
[01:41:04.062 --> 01:41:06.123]  I mean, that's so intellectually bankrupt.
[01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:14.461]  That is so deceptive, and the same thing with the most deceptive I've found are the Catholics who run it all crowd.
[01:41:14.461 --> 01:41:19.782]  Not that the Catholic Church isn't corrupt and calling for a new world order and doing all these bad things, but I'm not going to bash Catholics individually.
[01:41:19.782 --> 01:41:25.564]  I'm going to say, yeah, the Pope's calling for a world government and saying all religions are equal.
[01:41:25.564 --> 01:41:32.485]  And then I have countless guests on over the years and my detractors just lie and say that I've never talked about it or never covered it or never
[01:41:35.223 --> 01:41:44.013]  Never... I mean, I've done whole weeks where I do two or three shows in a row on things like that, and they'll just say, no, you haven't!
[01:41:44.013 --> 01:41:47.937]  And there is a whole industry out there of how Alex Jones is bad.
[01:41:53.402 --> 01:41:54.622]  And a lot of it is self-righteousness.
[01:41:54.622 --> 01:41:58.903]  Maybe people out there knew more than I did about a particular group or organization.
[01:41:58.903 --> 01:42:06.885]  I'm a generalist in knowledge, and I've learned more, and I've gotten more courage, and I've... I mean, I'm a genuine, real person.
[01:42:06.885 --> 01:42:11.627]  And I don't like hurting people's feelings, and I don't like attacking groups, and I don't enjoy it.
[01:42:11.627 --> 01:42:13.627]  And so I'm forced to do this.
[01:42:13.627 --> 01:42:17.368]  I'm forced to put myself in danger and, you know, cover these things.
[01:42:20.023 --> 01:42:34.273]  You know, I come out and I'm in the first big show to expose that Israel basically ran much of the agenda in Georgia as their defense minister being an Israeli, their foreign minister, many others, and I put it out on the web and people say, oh, you piece of crap, you know, you're covering up for Israel.
[01:42:34.273 --> 01:42:39.697]  What the hell are you talking about?
[01:42:39.697 --> 01:42:42.499]  I mean, I remember losing radio stations.
[01:42:42.499 --> 01:42:44.380]  One of them was the Lion.
[01:42:44.380 --> 01:42:47.803]  A big station, 10,000 watts, covering about half of Colorado.
[01:42:47.803 --> 01:42:49.464]  Been on there a couple years, huge audience.
[01:42:50.489 --> 01:42:52.875]  And they called me up and they said, you're criticizing Israel, we're taking you off.
[01:42:54.224 --> 01:42:58.566]  Unless you stop, and I just said, well, please, you know, we're getting a lot of complaints.
[01:42:58.566 --> 01:42:59.847]  I said, well, I can't stop.
[01:42:59.847 --> 01:43:01.508]  I mean, I've got to talk about some of this.
[01:43:01.508 --> 01:43:03.509]  I don't hate Israel or Jews.
[01:43:03.509 --> 01:43:06.051]  I mean, I'm just here covering what Israel's doing.
[01:43:06.051 --> 01:43:07.331]  They said, that's it, you're off.
[01:43:07.331 --> 01:43:08.852]  And then a couple other stations took me off.
[01:43:08.852 --> 01:43:15.276]  I mean, I lose radio stations five years ago, three, four years ago, to tell the truth here on this show.
[01:43:15.276 --> 01:43:16.797]  I take the hard stances.
[01:43:16.797 --> 01:43:19.858]  I make a film about Israel attacking the USS Liberty, now declassified.
[01:43:19.858 --> 01:43:20.739]  I've been totally vindicated.
[01:43:21.761 --> 01:43:25.482]  Because I interviewed the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Admirals, the people on board the Liberty.
[01:43:25.482 --> 01:43:27.442]  I mean, I brought you the classified info.
[01:43:27.442 --> 01:43:28.883]  Now it's been declassified.
[01:43:28.883 --> 01:43:31.923]  I got death threats over that.
[01:43:31.923 --> 01:43:38.205]  And then I get from the other side that I'm covering up.
[01:43:38.205 --> 01:43:49.567]  All because I knew that one of the people in the Hate the Jews movement was a convicted felon and involved in all this intelligence and involved in all this corruption and I knew about his criminal record, so I would never interview the guy.
[01:43:50.265 --> 01:43:52.046]  So he comes out and tells all these lies about me.
[01:43:52.046 --> 01:43:56.868]  I mean, they're jealous that I'm successful and that I have millions of listeners and they don't.
[01:43:56.868 --> 01:43:59.009]  And I'm successful because I'm genuine.
[01:43:59.009 --> 01:44:01.931]  And there's people out there that have discernment and they know I'm genuine.
[01:44:01.931 --> 01:44:04.412]  And they've watched everything I talk about come true.
[01:44:04.412 --> 01:44:07.053]  And they've seen me be attacked from every angle and every side.
[01:44:10.228 --> 01:44:12.170]  This New World Order is hurting Mexicans.
[01:44:12.170 --> 01:44:13.211]  It's hurting Canadians.
[01:44:13.211 --> 01:44:15.114]  It's hurting people in the U.S.
[01:44:15.114 --> 01:44:16.255]  It's hurting Germans.
[01:44:16.255 --> 01:44:17.376]  It's hurting Jews.
[01:44:17.376 --> 01:44:18.517]  It's hurting Israelis.
[01:44:18.517 --> 01:44:19.679]  It's hurting Chinese.
[01:44:19.679 --> 01:44:20.840]  It's hurting Japanese.
[01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:22.482]  It's hurting Russians.
[01:44:22.482 --> 01:44:23.843]  It's hurting Laotians.
[01:44:23.843 --> 01:44:25.025]  It's hurting Inuits.
[01:44:25.025 --> 01:44:28.929]  That's Eskimos for those in the public school education system.
[01:44:28.929 --> 01:44:30.631]  I know the New World Order is hurting people.
[01:44:31.417 --> 01:44:33.679]  I know the New World Order is doing bad things.
[01:44:33.679 --> 01:44:35.480]  I know they're federalizing and taking over.
[01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:37.982]  I know they're ignoring the states and the legislatures.
[01:44:37.982 --> 01:44:47.729]  I know they're building FEMA camps and told you about it a decade before it was in the Houston Chronicle and the San Francisco Chronicle and the Chicago Tribune.
[01:44:47.729 --> 01:44:52.533]  And we have really stepped out, folks, with this fabled enemies.
[01:44:52.533 --> 01:44:53.173]  And what do we get?
[01:44:53.173 --> 01:44:54.975]  Do we get thank you for taking a bold stance?
[01:44:54.975 --> 01:44:55.395]  Do we get
[01:44:55.962 --> 01:44:58.083]  Thank you for doing this.
[01:44:58.083 --> 01:45:02.285]  We get, man, this is, you know, really hardcore what you're doing for somebody as prominent as you.
[01:45:02.285 --> 01:45:06.488]  No, we get, you piece of crap.
[01:45:06.488 --> 01:45:08.249]  You're a piece of crap.
[01:45:08.249 --> 01:45:09.789]  Well, let me tell those people something.
[01:45:09.789 --> 01:45:16.313]  You're not going to grow your movements and you're not going to reach more people if you can't ever have anyone
[01:45:19.011 --> 01:45:22.432]  Ever come even a degree towards your point of view without attacking them.
[01:45:22.432 --> 01:45:23.973]  You're in this for the wrong reason.
[01:45:23.973 --> 01:45:29.135]  You're not in this to fight corruption and wake people up and bring people together and expose government-sponsored terror.
[01:45:29.135 --> 01:45:37.038]  You're here on an egomaniac trip on a personal power trip.
[01:45:37.038 --> 01:45:43.500]  If you were genuine and did this stuff for the right reasons, you would then become the leaders you wanted to be.
[01:45:45.695 --> 01:45:48.416]  Me, I never had a rhyme, a reason, a formula.
[01:45:48.416 --> 01:45:56.439]  I just did what my heart told me, what my intellect told me, and I did what was right, and I did what my spirit told me.
[01:45:56.439 --> 01:46:02.401]  And that is what I continue to do, boldly, through the hell I have gone through, things I won't even say on air.
[01:46:02.401 --> 01:46:05.022]  It is unbelievable, the fires I've gone through.
[01:46:05.022 --> 01:46:13.205]  But every time, God has rewarded me, and every time things have gotten better afterwards, that I go to the fire and just totally commit to fighting tyranny.
[01:46:13.205 --> 01:46:15.366]  And I go down a very dark road, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:46:16.272 --> 01:46:18.735]  But I know that there is an end to this.
[01:46:18.735 --> 01:46:25.221]  The only way out is by facing it and fighting it and being bold and telling the truth.
[01:46:25.221 --> 01:46:36.532]  And I will not engage in tribalism and infighting and focusing in and demonizing one group, no matter how racist or horrible that group's leadership may be.
[01:46:39.998 --> 01:46:47.683]  I will not lower myself to the level of Araza and Mecha, who openly talk about killing the gringo in the planet San Diego and all this incredible stuff.
[01:46:47.683 --> 01:46:57.048]  I will simply try to lovingly, but forcefully, wake up all Americans to come together and realize the globalists want us to fight each other, want us to kill each other.
[01:46:57.048 --> 01:47:00.090]  In fact, cue up Top Rankin, Bob Marley.
[01:47:00.090 --> 01:47:02.571]  I want to play this when we come back.
[01:47:02.571 --> 01:47:04.593]  Because I think the song says it all.
[01:47:04.593 --> 01:47:06.674]  And yes, I know they were black nationalists and
[01:47:09.244 --> 01:47:13.488]  You know, thought that the source of evil was Whitey.
[01:47:13.488 --> 01:47:14.108]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:47:14.108 --> 01:47:16.270]  The song Spirit is right.
[01:47:16.270 --> 01:47:19.053]  And they were talking about blacks killing each other.
[01:47:19.053 --> 01:47:21.595]  Well, we all need to stop killing each other.
[01:47:21.595 --> 01:47:23.477]  We all need to stop fighting with each other.
[01:47:23.477 --> 01:47:25.759]  That doesn't mean we don't expose the evil leadership.
[01:47:25.759 --> 01:47:34.627]  But when you attack a whole people because of their leadership, then the population ends up going under the wing of their leadership more and supporting them.
[01:47:35.228 --> 01:47:44.015]  You know, I've said I've made the mistake on air just bashing police, frothing, because of their brutality and corruption and how they haven't been in many cities and areas accountable.
[01:47:44.015 --> 01:47:46.217]  I end up bashing police at a primitive level.
[01:47:46.217 --> 01:47:47.258]  I'm primitive.
[01:47:47.258 --> 01:47:54.004]  Then that makes them compact more into their gang mentality, into their thin blue line, us against them mode that they talk about.
[01:47:56.633 --> 01:48:01.679]  Instead of reaching out to them as humans and showing them how they're being manipulated, how they're being federalized, how they're being controlled.
[01:48:01.679 --> 01:48:05.943]  And when I finally do that, the police open up and want to understand the truth.
[01:48:05.943 --> 01:48:07.485]  And does it mean I'm perfect?
[01:48:07.485 --> 01:48:07.986]  No.
[01:48:07.986 --> 01:48:11.389]  I've done a lot of damage with relations between the citizens and the police.
[01:48:11.389 --> 01:48:12.751]  They've done a lot of damage too.
[01:48:12.751 --> 01:48:15.554]  But I gotta get the beam out of my eye before I get the beam out of their eye.
[01:48:16.678 --> 01:48:20.400]  We gotta be statesmen here about this, and I'm trying to grow into that statesman.
[01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:26.982]  Because the incredible responsibility I have as the de facto leader of the resistance, and that's who I am!
[01:48:26.982 --> 01:48:29.843]  I have to admit that and step into those shoes.
[01:48:29.843 --> 01:48:31.324]  And it's upsetting.
[01:48:31.324 --> 01:48:33.605]  There isn't a thrill of exhilaration there.
[01:48:33.605 --> 01:48:34.686]  There's a great weight in that.
[01:48:34.686 --> 01:48:38.547]  I'm gonna come back with Top Rankin for all of us to come together.
[01:48:38.547 --> 01:48:39.588]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:48:39.588 --> 01:48:40.488]  This is Genesis.
[01:48:44.136 --> 01:48:45.639]  Why should I dominate?
[01:48:45.639 --> 01:48:48.804]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:48:48.804 --> 01:48:54.675]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:48:59.156 --> 01:49:04.597]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:49:04.597 --> 01:49:08.478]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:49:08.478 --> 01:49:11.038]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:49:11.038 --> 01:49:12.199]  Most people have no idea.
[01:49:12.199 --> 01:49:12.999]  They're not after money.
[01:49:12.999 --> 01:49:14.279]  They have all the money they need.
[01:49:14.279 --> 01:49:15.579]  They're after capitalism.

[01:49:27.082 --> 01:49:28.242]  You have been warned.
[01:49:34.445 --> 01:49:35.426]  We're good to go.
[01:50:11.420 --> 01:50:12.624]  Are you scared?
[01:50:50.527 --> 01:50:52.028]  I think.
[01:51:12.699 --> 01:51:20.228]  Brotherly love, brotherly love The sisterly love, sisterly love I feel this morning
[01:51:37.448 --> 01:52:01.236]  All they want us to do is keep on fucking and fighting They don't want to see us live together All they want us to do is keep on killing one another Top Rankin' Top Rankin' Did you mean what you said?
[01:52:01.236 --> 01:52:04.277]  Top Rankin' Are you skankin'?
[01:52:28.084 --> 01:52:34.326]  All of those that attack me, that attack liberty, that attack freedom, that attack innocence, you're on the losing side of history.
[01:52:34.326 --> 01:52:41.208]  And that goes for people in the New World Order system, people in our own movement that are fighting the New World Order for the wrong reasons.
[01:52:42.671 --> 01:52:44.151]  It's time for wisdom.
[01:52:44.151 --> 01:52:45.372]  It's time for gut checks.
[01:52:45.372 --> 01:52:52.353]  It's time for all of us to self-analyze ourselves and ask ourselves why we're doing what we're doing.
[01:52:52.353 --> 01:52:57.875]  And to ask ourselves if we are twisting.
[01:52:57.875 --> 01:52:58.755]  Twisting ourselves.
[01:52:58.755 --> 01:53:01.776]  Twisting our motivations.
[01:53:01.776 --> 01:53:02.836]  Why are you in this movement?
[01:53:02.836 --> 01:53:06.077]  Why are you doing what you're doing?
[01:53:06.077 --> 01:53:12.138]  Why, once you lie about somebody and attack somebody, do you never admit you're wrong and then just add to that delusion?
[01:53:15.618 --> 01:53:17.820]  This radio show explodes by the day.
[01:53:17.820 --> 01:53:19.882]  The websites explode by the day.
[01:53:19.882 --> 01:53:23.004]  Our information just grows exponentially.
[01:53:23.004 --> 01:53:25.647]  There are InfoWars.com bumper stickers.
[01:53:25.647 --> 01:53:28.069]  There are groups and organizations.
[01:53:28.069 --> 01:53:40.819]  Just with the touchstone of this radio show, worldwide, tens of millions, and I'm only one person in this fight, there are tens of thousands of prominent people, lovely, wonderful people of every race, color, and creed.
[01:53:40.819 --> 01:53:43.762]  There are Chinese, there are Latin Americans, there are
[01:53:45.308 --> 01:53:57.597]  Germans, there are Jews, there are Brits, there are Scots, there are Irish, there are Africans, there are Indians, there are Native Americans.
[01:53:57.597 --> 01:54:05.682]  All of us together want our children to go up free and safe, and only liberty can deliver a hope of that.
[01:54:05.682 --> 01:54:06.243]  Stay with us.
[01:54:10.692 --> 01:54:14.093]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:54:16.413 --> 01:54:21.495]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[01:54:21.495 --> 01:54:23.935]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:54:23.935 --> 01:54:26.216]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:54:26.216 --> 01:54:27.776]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:54:27.776 --> 01:54:29.456]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:54:29.456 --> 01:54:32.357]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:54:32.357 --> 01:54:35.998]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:54:45.635 --> 01:54:50.526]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:54:54.295 --> 01:54:58.396]  How dare you?
[01:54:58.396 --> 01:55:01.977]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:55:01.977 --> 01:55:04.718]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:55:04.718 --> 01:55:11.200]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[01:55:16.281 --> 01:55:18.782]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:55:21.977 --> 01:55:24.378]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:55:24.378 --> 01:55:33.640]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:55:33.640 --> 01:55:34.941]  Big Brother.
[01:55:34.941 --> 01:55:36.721]  Mainstream media.
[01:55:36.721 --> 01:55:37.882]  Government cover-ups.
[01:55:37.882 --> 01:55:40.042]  You want answers?
[01:55:40.042 --> 01:55:41.983]  Well, so does he.
[01:55:41.983 --> 01:55:45.804]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:55:45.804 --> 01:55:49.885]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:55:55.595 --> 01:56:07.144]  I don't expect people in the liberty movement, the awakening movement, the pro-freedom movement, whatever you want to call it, to agree with everything I say and do and all of my guests.
[01:56:07.144 --> 01:56:11.007]  Because sometimes in hindsight I don't agree with the things I've done or said.
[01:56:11.007 --> 01:56:14.490]  But I do expect you to assess what you're doing.
[01:56:16.206 --> 01:56:24.429]  I'm not talking about people even attacking me, but people that just spend their time attacking other people in the Liberty Movement and self-policing and believing you'll become the leader of something if you continue that.
[01:56:24.429 --> 01:56:25.869]  No, you're wasting away.
[01:56:25.869 --> 01:56:27.329]  You're destroying yourself.
[01:56:27.329 --> 01:56:28.370]  I want you to be leaders.
[01:56:28.370 --> 01:56:30.430]  We need you.
[01:56:30.430 --> 01:56:35.692]  We need you to be focused and wise.
[01:56:35.692 --> 01:56:38.613]  We need all of you.
[01:56:38.613 --> 01:56:40.633]  In your gut, you know I'm for real.
[01:56:40.633 --> 01:56:42.354]  You know I love you and I care about you.
[01:56:43.948 --> 01:56:54.534]  Folks, the sodium fluoride, you can spend all day saying I'm mad and evil, but at least spend some of your time warning people that sodium fluoride is killing people, attacking all the glands, all the organs, thousands of studies.
[01:56:54.534 --> 01:57:03.018]  I told people a year ago, when they first approved it, that it had already killed a bunch of people in trials and caused thousands of autoimmune diseases that are crippling people.
[01:57:03.018 --> 01:57:06.160]  And I had guests in studio, medical doctors.
[01:57:06.160 --> 01:57:08.441]  And now, a year plus later, the death toll is much higher.
[01:57:08.441 --> 01:57:10.002]  And this is a whitewash number you're about to hear.
[01:57:10.929 --> 01:57:13.811]  Why aren't you warning women to not give them the Gardasil shot?
[01:57:13.811 --> 01:57:16.433]  It's a live cancer virus that doesn't even protect them.
[01:57:16.433 --> 01:57:17.333]  That actually hurts them.
[01:57:17.333 --> 01:57:20.075]  It says it on the insert.
[01:57:20.075 --> 01:57:21.056]  In fact, here's CNN.
[01:57:21.056 --> 01:57:25.278]  Listen to this.
[01:57:25.278 --> 01:57:29.241]  Taqueria Williams doesn't get to act like a kid anymore.
[01:57:29.241 --> 01:57:31.882]  She's just too tired.
[01:57:31.882 --> 01:57:36.205]  It kind of hurts.
[01:57:36.205 --> 01:57:37.226]  I used to do a lot.
[01:57:40.006 --> 01:57:50.234]  But Taqueria's mother says everything changed last December after her daughter received Gardasil, a vaccine that prevents 70% of cervical cancer.
[01:57:50.234 --> 01:57:51.395]  She's never been sick.
[01:57:51.395 --> 01:57:53.476]  She's never been in a hospital.
[01:57:53.476 --> 01:57:54.817]  Nothing.
[01:57:54.817 --> 01:57:55.958]  Until the Gardasil shot.
[01:57:57.313 --> 01:58:04.555]  Two months after getting the shot, Taqueria says she got a rash on her face and arms, leaving these scars.
[01:58:04.555 --> 01:58:10.976]  She had swelling all over, pain in her joints, and poor circulation in her fingertips.
[01:58:10.976 --> 01:58:23.719]  Her doctor told us she now suffers from an autoimmune disease and says it is possible the Gardasil triggered her illness, though she made it clear the cause cannot be proven.
[01:58:24.608 --> 01:58:28.409]  According to a federal tracking system called VAERS... Stop that!
[01:58:28.409 --> 01:58:28.849]  Stop that!
[01:58:28.849 --> 01:58:31.169]  We're going to play the death toll in a minute.
[01:58:31.169 --> 01:58:35.150]  The drug, the live cancer virus, they admit that's what it does.
[01:58:35.150 --> 01:58:37.910]  They admit that's one of the quote, side effects.
[01:58:37.910 --> 01:58:42.991]  And we've had medical doctors on who've documented that is what's happening and the trials that did that.
[01:58:42.991 --> 01:58:45.492]  We didn't tell you a year ago it made your hair fall out.
[01:58:45.492 --> 01:58:49.952]  We told you it causes autoimmune diseases which cripple you or kills you.
[01:58:49.952 --> 01:58:51.733]  And then now you're in the news, you're later admitting that.
[01:58:53.948 --> 01:58:59.611]  And so they go to some doctor who hasn't done the epidemiological test, and they're saying, well, I can't prove it, but it looks like it's connected.
[01:58:59.611 --> 01:59:02.852]  Well, the studies do prove that.
[01:59:02.852 --> 01:59:08.895]  Just like we played you clips of all the troops dying after they get vaccines, and the feds won't even say what the secret vaccine was.
[01:59:08.895 --> 01:59:10.135]  It's illegal.
[01:59:10.135 --> 01:59:13.137]  Federal courts have ruled they can't even make the military take shots.
[01:59:13.137 --> 01:59:14.697]  But they tell the troops they have to.
[01:59:14.697 --> 01:59:15.878]  Finish it up with a death toll.
[01:59:16.602 --> 01:59:26.830]  According to a federal tracking system called VAERS, there have been 9,749 adverse reactions following the vaccination.
[01:59:26.830 --> 01:59:29.392]  And 21 reported deaths since 2006.
[01:59:29.392 --> 01:59:33.214]  I chose to get my daughter vaccinated.
[01:59:33.214 --> 01:59:37.197]  But Merck, Gardasil's maker, points out these are anecdotal cases.
[01:59:37.197 --> 01:59:38.298]  All right, let's stop.
[01:59:38.298 --> 01:59:40.360]  As we told you a year ago, Merck knew
[01:59:41.972 --> 01:59:46.214]  That it was causing these problems, just like their Vioxx caused all the heart attacks and the rest of it.
[01:59:46.214 --> 01:59:51.756]  And so they had Governor Perry, who they paid, quote, make it mandatory, which it really wasn't, quote, recommended.
[01:59:51.756 --> 01:59:57.639]  So then Federal Vaccine Damage Fund kicked in, and federal liability payments kicked in to pay for the damage.
[01:59:57.639 --> 02:00:00.380]  Then they got it approved to roll out, knowing what it would do.
[02:00:01.678 --> 02:00:13.281]  Just like Bayer Pharmalogical knew that millions of people would get HIV and hepatitis from their factor VIII, they knew every injection of the blood product over a decade would give a death sentence to who took it.
[02:00:13.281 --> 02:00:15.302]  And that's all come out mainstream news.
[02:00:15.302 --> 02:00:19.983]  See, those are the issues that people better be talking about.
[02:00:19.983 --> 02:00:24.144]  And I've got to say, I've seen a few of my detractors actually do that.
[02:00:24.144 --> 02:00:25.344]  I commend you.
[02:00:25.344 --> 02:00:25.985]  That's good.
[02:00:25.985 --> 02:00:27.305]  Spend some time helping people.
[02:00:29.571 --> 02:00:32.433]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[02:00:32.433 --> 02:00:33.994]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[02:00:33.994 --> 02:00:36.135]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:00:36.135 --> 02:00:38.036]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[02:00:38.036 --> 02:00:39.517]  The late, great USA.
[02:00:39.517 --> 02:00:41.298]  America, freedom to fascism.
[02:00:41.298 --> 02:00:48.322]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[02:01:28.229 --> 02:01:32.851]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:01:32.851 --> 02:01:38.014]  Have you ever been told that communism has collapsed and no longer a threat to our national sovereignty?
[02:01:38.923 --> 02:01:46.870]  If so, why are communists overthrowing African and South and Central American governments to install a communist regime?
[02:01:46.870 --> 02:01:56.557]  If so, why is Cuba and China agreed with other communist countries to surround the United States in preparation for an attack to end capitalism?
[02:01:56.557 --> 02:02:04.524]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:02:05.999 --> 02:02:07.860]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.

[02:02:29.105 --> 02:02:38.007]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[02:02:38.007 --> 02:02:42.929]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evap and others are absorbed into the skin.
[02:02:42.929 --> 02:02:54.052]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[02:02:54.452 --> 02:03:00.213]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:03:00.213 --> 02:03:04.675]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine.
[02:03:04.675 --> 02:03:05.615]  I have a diarrhea.
[02:03:05.615 --> 02:03:06.655]  What about you?

[02:03:29.084 --> 02:03:31.846]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:03:31.846 --> 02:03:34.648]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:03:54.975 --> 02:03:57.976]  I'll go ahead and tell you who our surprise guest is today.
[02:03:57.976 --> 02:04:00.457]  They called us about 20 minutes ago and said he was running late.
[02:04:00.457 --> 02:04:06.840]  Hope I get my full 30 minutes with him.
[02:04:06.840 --> 02:04:11.522]  That's the Austin Police Chief, Art Acevedo.
[02:04:11.522 --> 02:04:17.024]  And he will be reportedly
[02:04:18.047 --> 02:04:20.568]  Joining us here in the next 10 minutes or so.
[02:04:20.568 --> 02:04:23.849]  I may have to play some clips while we get him into the chair.
[02:04:23.849 --> 02:04:30.152]  These guys always have very busy schedules and they know who we are and said they'd be happy to come on the show about two weeks ago.
[02:04:30.152 --> 02:04:36.735]  They set this date up and they say he's coming over here to our little South Austin office.
[02:04:36.735 --> 02:04:41.917]  So I am here waiting for that to happen.
[02:04:41.917 --> 02:04:44.698]  I bet he'll have an entourage too.
[02:04:44.698 --> 02:04:47.539]  Got quite a few questions for the police chief.
[02:04:51.403 --> 02:04:59.428]  I have to say that he's been the first police chief we've had in decades who, when police shoot people in the back, he kicks them off the force.
[02:04:59.428 --> 02:05:01.869]  And it's not because he doesn't like the police, it's because he knows.
[02:05:01.869 --> 02:05:05.551]  I'm going to ask him about this, but that's what other police chiefs have said, they've been doing the right thing.
[02:05:05.551 --> 02:05:11.035]  Because then it makes all the police look bad, and then destroys their image, and then destroys their effectiveness in the community.
[02:05:11.035 --> 02:05:14.917]  But we'll talk about that with him and a lot of other things with the Austin Police Chief.
[02:05:16.306 --> 02:05:18.887]  Who is scheduled to be joining us in studio.
[02:05:18.887 --> 02:05:20.067]  I bet a lot of police are listening.
[02:05:20.067 --> 02:05:21.888]  I know they always listen anyways.
[02:05:21.888 --> 02:05:23.888]  I've walked by squad cars before.
[02:05:23.888 --> 02:05:27.849]  Years ago on my show, I'll be rebroadcasting, you know, in a settled parking lot and hear them listening to it.
[02:05:27.849 --> 02:05:30.170]  I'll never forget.
[02:05:30.170 --> 02:05:35.151]  One time, uh, George Bush, it was in 2002.
[02:05:35.151 --> 02:05:41.453]  He had the, um, federal marshals guarding his daughters and
[02:05:43.914 --> 02:05:46.816]  It was my friend's 40th, uh, birthday, his wife's 40th birthday.
[02:05:46.816 --> 02:05:53.020]  It was actually Kevin Booth, uh, Trey Booth, his wife.
[02:05:53.020 --> 02:05:59.124]  We went to a steakhouse downtown, and I come walking up, and there's all these black suburbans, and they go, oh, Alex Jones!
[02:05:59.124 --> 02:06:04.188]  Oh my God, don't do that, Alex, just leave him alone, I'm not gonna say who's in there, I'm like, that's fine, they were fans of the show.
[02:06:04.188 --> 02:06:05.148]  And he goes, look!
[02:06:05.148 --> 02:06:12.093]  And the, and the, the federal marshal's in the car, another one, with the local FM that was rebroadcasting my show on, listening to it.
[02:06:13.376 --> 02:06:23.779]  And then I go in to the steakhouse, and they happen to see us in this huge steakhouse.
[02:06:23.779 --> 02:06:24.800]  Well, it's pretty big.
[02:06:24.800 --> 02:06:27.701]  City Grill.
[02:06:27.701 --> 02:06:29.221]  Several big rooms.
[02:06:29.221 --> 02:06:32.542]  Right next to the Bush daughters, who were getting completely drunk.
[02:06:32.542 --> 02:06:33.702]  This is after they turned 21.
[02:06:33.702 --> 02:06:34.103]  They just turned 21.
[02:06:34.103 --> 02:06:35.283]  They're twins.
[02:06:36.594 --> 02:06:42.016]  And, uh, they're in there with their punk rock boyfriends, with the devil tats and pentagram shirts, literally.
[02:06:42.016 --> 02:06:45.217]  And Kevin goes, I've got a video camera in my car, let's get video, this'll be huge.
[02:06:45.217 --> 02:06:48.478]  And I said, do not even think about it.
[02:06:48.478 --> 02:06:53.519]  Went in like American Media, they inquired a piece on them, they got anthrax mailed to them.
[02:06:53.519 --> 02:06:56.440]  And I literally had to reach over and get Kevin by the arm, and I said, no.
[02:06:56.440 --> 02:07:00.661]  Oh, they're here!
[02:07:00.661 --> 02:07:01.481]  Are they already in the building?
[02:07:01.481 --> 02:07:03.862]  Hey, it's the police chief, smiling at me through the window!
[02:07:04.717 --> 02:07:06.078]  Uh, well, you know what?
[02:07:06.078 --> 02:07:10.482]  Go to that, uh, that piece we were gonna play, so I have time to get the police chief in here and greet him.
[02:07:10.482 --> 02:07:11.202]  Go ahead and go to that, John.
[02:07:11.202 --> 02:07:12.783]  We'll be back in three minutes.
[02:07:12.783 --> 02:07:14.705]  I don't have to tell you things are bad.
[02:07:14.705 --> 02:07:16.486]  Everybody knows things are bad.
[02:07:16.486 --> 02:07:18.408]  It's a depression.
[02:07:18.408 --> 02:07:22.711]  Everybody's out of work, or scared of losing their job.
[02:07:22.711 --> 02:07:24.713]  The dollar buys a nickel's worth.
[02:07:24.713 --> 02:07:25.814]  Banks are going bust.
[02:07:25.814 --> 02:07:28.376]  Shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter.
[02:07:28.376 --> 02:07:32.539]  Punks are running wild in the street, and there's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do, and there's no end to it.
[02:07:34.187 --> 02:07:35.028]  We know.
[02:07:35.028 --> 02:07:36.711]  The air is unfit to breathe.
[02:07:36.711 --> 02:07:38.093]  Our food is unfit to eat.
[02:07:38.854 --> 02:07:47.697]  We sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had 15 homicides and 63 violent crimes, as if that's the way it's supposed to be.
[02:07:47.697 --> 02:07:50.357]  We know things are bad, worse than bad.
[02:07:50.357 --> 02:07:51.078]  They're crazy.
[02:07:51.078 --> 02:07:54.699]  It's like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don't go out anymore.
[02:07:54.699 --> 02:08:01.661]  We sit in the house and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller and all we say is, please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms.
[02:08:01.661 --> 02:08:06.222]  Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radios and I won't say anything.
[02:08:06.222 --> 02:08:07.283]  Just leave us alone.
[02:08:07.283 --> 02:08:08.623]  Well, I'm not going to leave you alone.
[02:08:09.523 --> 02:08:10.704]  I want you to get mad!
[02:08:10.704 --> 02:08:12.886]  I don't want you to protest.
[02:08:12.886 --> 02:08:13.947]  I don't want you to riot.
[02:08:13.947 --> 02:08:17.250]  I don't want you to write to your congressmen because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write.
[02:08:17.250 --> 02:08:21.893]  I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street.
[02:08:21.893 --> 02:08:24.876]  All I know is that first, you've got to get mad!
[02:08:24.876 --> 02:08:26.998]  You've got to say, I'm a human being!
[02:08:26.998 --> 02:08:29.820]  My life has value!
[02:08:29.820 --> 02:08:33.283]  I want you to get up now.
[02:08:33.283 --> 02:08:35.365]  I want all of you to get up out of your chairs.
[02:08:36.545 --> 02:08:47.055]  I want you to get up right now and go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell, I'm as bad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!
[02:08:47.055 --> 02:09:00.749]  I want you to get up right now, get up, go to your windows, open them and stick your head out and yell, I'm as bad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!
[02:09:25.004 --> 02:09:35.392]  The relationship between Bin Laden and the CIA was essentially, he was one of the assets, one of the people they could turn to if they wanted something done, they went to Bin Laden.
[02:09:36.411 --> 02:09:40.054]  In the early 1980s, Bin Laden worked with operatives from U.S.
[02:09:40.054 --> 02:09:44.117]  intelligence, the Pakistani military, and Arab states.
[02:09:44.117 --> 02:09:57.446]  Is it not true that the United States government paid $300 million to the Bin Laden family for the construction of the military camps?
[02:09:57.446 --> 02:10:05.212]  At basis, though, I really think that these were more CIA assets, people that were recruited, like all of the folks I've been issuing visas to.
[02:10:06.657 --> 02:10:10.800]  Then we have the evidence that there were foreign governments involved.
[02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:19.785]  Most of that information is classified, I think overly classified.
[02:10:19.785 --> 02:10:21.126]  Osama bin Laden.
[02:10:21.126 --> 02:10:22.146]  Osama bin Laden.
[02:10:22.146 --> 02:10:22.686]  Osama bin Laden.
[02:10:22.686 --> 02:10:23.807]  Osama bin Laden.
[02:10:23.807 --> 02:10:25.528]  Osama bin Laden.
[02:10:25.528 --> 02:10:30.071]  Remember 24 hours ago, it was the Bush tax cut, the Bush budget, the Bush economy.
[02:10:30.071 --> 02:10:30.831]  Live in 30 seconds.
[02:10:30.831 --> 02:10:32.632]  You don't hear any of that tonight.
[02:10:32.632 --> 02:10:34.213]  It's America's enemy.
[02:10:34.213 --> 02:10:35.454]  America's under attack.
[02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:43.860]  You're live.
[02:10:43.860 --> 02:10:47.102]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, I am really excited and he's a really nice guy.
[02:10:47.102 --> 02:10:51.284]  I guess that's why he's already a major police chief in a major city as young as he is.
[02:10:51.284 --> 02:10:56.287]  And he's got a long bio here, but I thought that he was for the rest of the hour being very gracious about that.
[02:10:56.287 --> 02:11:02.570]  Art Alcivedo, he is the Austin Police Chief who's now been in what, close to a year or so?
[02:11:02.570 --> 02:11:04.190]  A little over, a little over a year.
[02:11:04.190 --> 02:11:05.411]  And we're honored to have you, sir.
[02:11:05.411 --> 02:11:07.152]  Good to be here, finally get to meet you.
[02:11:07.532 --> 02:11:11.553]  Well, it's great to have you in studio with us today.
[02:11:11.553 --> 02:11:17.975]  Just out of the gate, instead of reading your lengthy bio, tell us a little bit about yourself, because this is an international audience, obviously, not just in Austin.
[02:11:17.975 --> 02:11:20.135]  Okay, well, I'm 44 years old.
[02:11:20.135 --> 02:11:26.677]  I'm a proud father of three kids, a 19-year-old, a 16-year-old, and a 4-month-old.
[02:11:26.677 --> 02:11:28.717]  I was born in Havana, Cuba.
[02:11:28.717 --> 02:11:32.038]  I migrated to the United States, one of the lucky ones that got out of Cuba in 1968.
[02:11:34.799 --> 02:11:41.485]  I always wanted to be a cop, became a cop, loved being a cop, and I did it out of a desire to really serve.
[02:11:41.485 --> 02:11:42.826]  I love people.
[02:11:42.826 --> 02:11:49.251]  I think being a cop is really about dealing with people, and if you can deal with people who have people skills, you can be very successful at policing.
[02:11:50.529 --> 02:11:54.995]  Now obviously, you've got courage coming into the lion's den here.
[02:11:54.995 --> 02:12:01.864]  Well, hey, I frisked you down, I don't see any weapons on you, so words can't kill you, I hope.
[02:12:01.864 --> 02:12:04.468]  No, no, listen, listen, we've always wanted a relationship with the police.
[02:12:05.469 --> 02:12:14.456]  And you know, I don't like the fact, and I've probably been bad in the past, bashing police too much, and that kind of compacts police into their own little culture instead of having the public and the police interface.
[02:12:14.456 --> 02:12:23.663]  And I know that since you've gotten in, you've done a lot of things I've actually really agreed with, some things I've disagreed with, and really have been interfacing with the media, the public.
[02:12:23.663 --> 02:12:28.547]  I mean, you've got to be the hardest working police chief I've ever seen living in Austin for the last 18 years.
[02:12:29.107 --> 02:12:29.567]  Well, great.
[02:12:29.567 --> 02:12:30.668]  Well, thank you for that.
[02:12:30.668 --> 02:12:31.548]  But, you know, it's important.
[02:12:31.548 --> 02:12:33.570]  Look, we have nothing to hide.
[02:12:33.570 --> 02:12:36.992]  I really believe that through transparency comes trust.
[02:12:36.992 --> 02:12:40.934]  And the more transparent we are, the more we engage the community.
[02:12:40.934 --> 02:12:44.596]  Sometimes we're going to have to agree to disagree, and that's okay.
[02:12:44.596 --> 02:12:48.278]  But we have to have a dialogue because that's what's going to breed trust.
[02:12:48.278 --> 02:12:51.040]  And with trust, I think, comes safety and a better quality of life for all of us.
[02:12:51.656 --> 02:12:53.498]  Now Chief, I've got a lot of questions here for you.
[02:12:53.498 --> 02:12:54.919]  Okay, I'll buy the answers.
[02:12:54.919 --> 02:12:58.762]  Out of the gate though, tell us about your philosophy before we go to this break in just a moment.
[02:12:58.762 --> 02:13:01.424]  Your philosophy versus some of your predecessors.
[02:13:02.250 --> 02:13:07.432]  Well, my philosophy, I think, is transparency and accountability are the two most important things to me.
[02:13:07.432 --> 02:13:11.833]  If we're transparent, I really believe we have a pretty darn good department, so why not be transparent?
[02:13:11.833 --> 02:13:14.574]  And why not put the good, the bad, and the ugly out there?
[02:13:14.574 --> 02:13:20.296]  Because by doing that, people start realizing that we have nothing to hide and they can actually trust us.
[02:13:20.296 --> 02:13:26.958]  And I think in the past, we really haven't engaged as an organization, the community, the media, your critics.
[02:13:26.958 --> 02:13:29.159]  Some people run away from activists, I actually run towards them.
[02:13:29.719 --> 02:13:36.583]  Because I want to know what they have to say, and I want them to know what I feel, what I believe, so at least we can have that mutual respect.
[02:13:36.583 --> 02:13:38.043]  Well, there have been big changes.
[02:13:38.043 --> 02:13:42.986]  Also, in the past, if Austin Police shot somebody in the back, they would not get in trouble.
[02:13:42.986 --> 02:13:45.067]  Now, they have been getting in trouble.
[02:13:45.905 --> 02:13:48.666]  Well, you know, you're talking about the Kevin Brown shooting.
[02:13:48.666 --> 02:13:52.966]  That was a tragic event for everybody involved, including the sergeant who was fired.
[02:13:52.966 --> 02:13:56.507]  But the reality is, we've got to call them as we see them.
[02:13:56.507 --> 02:13:58.548]  I know the community likes some of the calls.
[02:13:58.548 --> 02:14:00.188]  They'll dislike some of the calls.
[02:14:00.188 --> 02:14:10.730]  But I think if people know your heart and they know that you actually care and that you're trying to do the right thing, they may not agree with you, but at least they'll respect the fact that you're trying and that your heart's in the right place, which is important.
[02:14:11.789 --> 02:14:24.194]  Well, absolutely, and you've done some other things that have been good, and I've been happy to see police and the union not attacking you as much because they understand that if they don't clean house, it's just going to be downhill.
[02:14:24.909 --> 02:14:27.211]  You know, and that's true.
[02:14:27.211 --> 02:14:29.473]  The reality is we don't have that much cleaning to do.
[02:14:29.473 --> 02:14:33.877]  The majority of our cops are really hard-working, dedicated professionals.
[02:14:33.877 --> 02:14:41.844]  But it doesn't take more than one or two or three or a handful to really diminish the excellence and destroy the excellence in the bridges that we're building.
[02:14:41.844 --> 02:14:43.045]  I'll tell you what, we're going to break.
[02:14:43.045 --> 02:14:44.126]  That's a great place to leave it off.
[02:14:44.126 --> 02:14:44.927]  Stay there, sir.
[02:14:44.927 --> 02:14:48.010]  Back in just a few minutes with the Austin Police Chief in studio with us.
[02:14:56.135 --> 02:15:02.799]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:15:02.799 --> 02:15:10.904]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:15:10.904 --> 02:15:19.088]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:15:19.088 --> 02:15:23.831]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:15:24.171 --> 02:15:33.742]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power, a gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:15:33.742 --> 02:15:34.823]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:15:34.823 --> 02:15:39.348]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[02:15:39.348 --> 02:15:40.709]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[02:15:44.213 --> 02:15:47.215]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[02:15:47.215 --> 02:15:51.118]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:15:51.118 --> 02:15:55.740]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:15:55.740 --> 02:16:01.464]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[02:16:01.464 --> 02:16:02.825]  And we knew what to do.
[02:16:02.825 --> 02:16:04.786]  Or at least we thought we did.
[02:16:04.786 --> 02:16:11.811]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[02:16:11.811 --> 02:16:12.191]  Whitman
[02:16:13.371 --> 02:16:18.523]  EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air
[02:16:19.229 --> 02:16:20.710]  We're safe to breathe.
[02:16:20.710 --> 02:16:27.814]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[02:16:27.814 --> 02:16:30.976]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[02:16:30.976 --> 02:16:36.759]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[02:16:36.759 --> 02:16:39.841]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[02:16:39.841 --> 02:16:45.884]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[02:16:45.884 --> 02:16:47.906]  Or order the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:16:48.786 --> 02:16:53.713]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[02:17:06.502 --> 02:17:07.003]  He says, yeah.
[02:17:07.003 --> 02:17:08.084]  He says, what am I going to do?
[02:17:08.084 --> 02:17:08.664]  I've got a truck.
[02:17:08.664 --> 02:17:11.587]  There's no way anybody's going to buy my truck in this market.
[02:17:11.587 --> 02:17:13.489]  I really need the truck for my job.
[02:17:13.489 --> 02:17:15.492]  It uses more gas than I can afford.
[02:17:15.492 --> 02:17:17.734]  I've got to find a way to come up with some extra money.
[02:17:17.734 --> 02:17:19.416]  I've got a wife with four kids at home.
[02:17:19.416 --> 02:17:20.517]  I don't know what to do.
[02:17:20.517 --> 02:17:21.578]  I said, Bob, relax.
[02:17:21.578 --> 02:17:22.239]  I know what to do.

[02:17:27.120 --> 02:17:37.644]  They will deliver food, really good, high-quality, nutritional, delicious food to your door, your door now, right there in front of your house, for about half the price that you were paying for groceries last year.

[02:17:45.506 --> 02:17:46.688]  Why don't you do that, Bob?
[02:17:46.688 --> 02:17:47.730]  He said, EFoodsDirect.com?
[02:17:47.730 --> 02:17:47.970]  I said, yep.
[02:17:47.970 --> 02:17:48.672]  Call them at 1-800-409-5633.
[02:17:48.672 --> 02:17:48.992]  That's 800-409-5633.
[02:17:48.992 --> 02:17:49.253]  Do it now.
[02:18:00.679 --> 02:18:02.741]  You wash your car, how long does it last?
[02:18:02.741 --> 02:18:03.522]  Three days?
[02:18:03.522 --> 02:18:04.163]  A week?
[02:18:04.163 --> 02:18:05.103]  Two weeks?
[02:18:05.103 --> 02:18:10.568]  Life Change Tea eliminates chemicals, toxins and parasites and much more.
[02:18:10.568 --> 02:18:11.309]  The effect?
[02:18:11.309 --> 02:18:12.290]  You lose weight.
[02:18:12.290 --> 02:18:13.691]  That's right, you lose weight.
[02:18:13.691 --> 02:18:15.053]  So here's the story.
[02:18:15.053 --> 02:18:17.195]  You wash your car, it gets dirty again.
[02:18:17.195 --> 02:18:20.317]  You cleanse your body, chemicals and toxins come back.
[02:18:20.317 --> 02:18:20.638]  The fix?
[02:18:21.238 --> 02:18:22.438]  Stay on the T!
[02:18:22.438 --> 02:18:24.339]  And here's how we will help.
[02:18:24.339 --> 02:18:27.740]  Ask for the Mid-State Fair Special when ordering.
[02:18:27.740 --> 02:18:28.940]  Here's how to order.
[02:18:28.940 --> 02:18:29.780]  Online.
[02:18:29.780 --> 02:18:31.301]  GetTheTee.com.
[02:18:31.301 --> 02:18:33.701]  That's GetTheTee.com.
[02:18:33.701 --> 02:18:34.262]  Or call us.
[02:18:34.262 --> 02:18:34.662]  928-308-0408.
[02:18:34.662 --> 02:18:35.302]  That's 928-308-0408.
[02:18:35.302 --> 02:18:36.162]  Get The Tee.
[02:18:36.162 --> 02:18:39.123]  Restoring America's health, one teabag at a time.
[02:19:00.831 --> 02:19:08.300]  Austin Police Chief Mart Acevedo is our guest in studio and now we can start the interrogation.
[02:19:08.300 --> 02:19:09.000]  Here we go.
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:10.162]  You like the interrogation room?
[02:19:10.162 --> 02:19:11.784]  We have lots of lights, a little bit of room.
[02:19:11.784 --> 02:19:16.889]  I like the padding, you know, so when you get rough with me, I know I'm not going to hurt myself too badly.
[02:19:16.889 --> 02:19:18.211]  You know, I'm surprised that
[02:19:19.392 --> 02:19:26.257]  You didn't bring a whole entourage with you, because other awesome police chiefs I've noticed would normally have an entourage, and then guys out in the parking lot.
[02:19:26.257 --> 02:19:35.043]  I've worked at a few other radio stations doing my show out of there, and like the police chiefs would be coming on other shows sometimes, and you'd see guys in the parking lot looking around.
[02:19:35.043 --> 02:19:39.366]  No, I'm a one-man traveling, so I brought Anna Sabamy.
[02:19:39.366 --> 02:19:40.667]  She's our public information manager.
[02:19:40.667 --> 02:19:45.531]  I think that it's important for her to meet the folks out here in the media so you can have a relationship with our office.
[02:19:46.656 --> 02:19:48.597]  Okay, let's get into the tough questions in this short segment.
[02:19:48.597 --> 02:19:51.538]  We've got a long one coming up after the next break.
[02:19:51.538 --> 02:19:52.539]  Plate scanning.
[02:19:52.539 --> 02:19:56.841]  They've announced all over the country, the Feds have put in these license plate reading cameras.
[02:19:56.841 --> 02:19:58.481]  Police cars are getting them.
[02:19:58.481 --> 02:20:00.262]  It's all part of this larger NORTHCOM grid.
[02:20:00.262 --> 02:20:01.683]  You have the emergency management centers.
[02:20:01.943 --> 02:20:02.383]  We're good to go.
[02:20:19.079 --> 02:20:26.466]  Well, I think any technology, it's not the technology that is bad or evil or anything else, it's how you use it.
[02:20:26.466 --> 02:20:34.913]  License plate readers are a good tool when you're looking for, on an AMBER Alert, a partial plate on a kid that's been kidnapped, you can actually program that system, let's say it's 123 SAM,
[02:20:38.036 --> 02:20:40.918]  And all you have is one, two, three, and it'll spit out any car it'll identify.
[02:20:40.918 --> 02:20:42.740]  Here's a car that you're looking for.
[02:20:42.740 --> 02:20:48.405]  So it helps us in terms of finding wanted vehicles and recovering stolen cars.
[02:20:48.405 --> 02:20:54.390]  With that said, if we bring it here, it's solely for our local law enforcement use and nothing else.
[02:20:54.390 --> 02:20:58.554]  But those grids, those grants are paid for by the feds, and if you'd like me to give you documents, I can.
[02:20:58.554 --> 02:21:01.477]  They're also feeding into that with NSA technology.
[02:21:02.571 --> 02:21:03.471]  Well, I'm not aware of that.
[02:21:03.471 --> 02:21:04.212]  That's something I've never heard.
[02:21:04.212 --> 02:21:09.154]  Okay, well what about the gunshot detectors they started putting up in 1998, which are really microphones?
[02:21:09.154 --> 02:21:09.795]  Gunshot detectors?
[02:21:09.795 --> 02:21:10.615]  We don't have them here.
[02:21:10.615 --> 02:21:14.557]  We're very fortunate that we have a city that's a very safe city.
[02:21:14.557 --> 02:21:18.039]  What about the grants that were announced in 1998 that were putting them in in East Austin?
[02:21:18.039 --> 02:21:19.059]  We don't have them here.
[02:21:19.059 --> 02:21:21.440]  I mean, if we have them, I haven't seen them or heard about them.
[02:21:21.440 --> 02:21:22.281]  Such news to me!
[02:21:23.882 --> 02:21:26.303]  Well, those are federally put in, so I guess it's for the fed boys.
[02:21:26.303 --> 02:21:31.666]  Yeah, the Austin Police Department does not have that technology here.
[02:21:31.666 --> 02:21:32.887]  What about munialization?
[02:21:32.887 --> 02:21:40.671]  I'm always hearing about our police being sent to Israel, or Israel coming over here, or our police being sent to Japan, to Tokyo, and then their officers can come over here and pick people up.
[02:21:40.671 --> 02:21:41.351]  We can go over there.
[02:21:41.351 --> 02:21:41.992]  What's going on with that?
[02:21:42.679 --> 02:21:50.601]  Well, what these are, some of those programs, actually exchange programs, where you actually go and look at some of their tactics in terms of security.
[02:21:50.601 --> 02:22:07.046]  I actually went on one myself where basically it was a tour of their facilities and just to learn from their experiences in terms of terrorism and things of that nature, but we have not had any delegation here that I'm aware of.
[02:22:08.638 --> 02:22:14.321]  I've got a film I made six years ago, so you may not be aware of the specifics of what I'm talking about, but I'm sure you are.
[02:22:14.321 --> 02:22:26.727]  The programs where the Austin police enroll the children with a $200 discount credit card, and they get the $200 for turning people in, reporting on drugs, crime, but they also tell them to go home and what's in the medicine cabinet.
[02:22:26.727 --> 02:22:27.747]  That sounds like East Germany.
[02:22:27.747 --> 02:22:28.788]  Are you aware of that Austin program?
[02:22:29.469 --> 02:22:31.393]  I don't think we have that program anymore.
[02:22:31.393 --> 02:22:36.041]  If you do, you need to let me know where it's happening because I can tell you that we're not in that business.
[02:22:36.041 --> 02:22:37.324]  But you were aware of that program.
[02:22:37.324 --> 02:22:39.728]  I mean, this was years ago here, but I'm told it's still going on.
[02:22:40.359 --> 02:22:41.059]  No.
[02:22:41.059 --> 02:22:44.920]  If it's going on, somebody needs to tell me where and when so I can look into that.
[02:22:44.920 --> 02:22:47.640]  I would not be in favor of a program of that sort.
[02:22:47.640 --> 02:23:02.603]  Well, what I'm going to do is we're going to go over this interview, and in a few months, I know you're a busy man, I'd like to have you back in, and I will have all the documents on each issue, and I will play the video of the Austin TV ad that they show inside the schools, where it told the kids, you know, you're going to get $200 for whoever you turn in.
[02:23:02.603 --> 02:23:04.843]  You're going to report on people.
[02:23:04.843 --> 02:23:07.664]  And then they have the children write essays about what's going on in their home life?
[02:23:08.837 --> 02:23:18.341]  Like I said, what happened back then I can't attest to, but I can tell you that we don't have a program like that today, and I would not be in favor of a program like that.
[02:23:18.341 --> 02:23:19.962]  Well good, I like you even more!
[02:23:19.962 --> 02:23:23.523]  What about federalization?
[02:23:23.523 --> 02:23:29.686]  We have all this federal funds, unfunded mandates coming in, some funded, with the case of the blood taking.
[02:23:29.686 --> 02:23:35.189]  Now I know here, you're... Are you talking about my phlebotomy program that I talked about recently?
[02:23:35.189 --> 02:23:38.150]  Well they're taking blood at checkpoints, or dragging people off to have their blood taken.
[02:23:38.655 --> 02:23:42.638]  No, what's happened, I'm glad you brought that up, that's one of the reasons I'm here because I think it's really important.
[02:23:42.638 --> 02:23:46.541]  Look, we are in one of the worst states in the Union from drunk driving.
[02:23:46.541 --> 02:23:55.488]  Drunk driving is something that I brought some of the stats where, you know, 40,000 plus Americans a year are getting killed in this country.
[02:23:55.488 --> 02:23:58.230]  Nearly 2,000 Texans are getting killed from drunk driving.
[02:23:58.230 --> 02:23:59.031]  You can have them.
[02:23:59.031 --> 02:24:00.212]  I'm just going to show people on camera.
[02:24:00.792 --> 02:24:04.535]  Uh, and the reality is, it is, it is, it is carnage.
[02:24:04.535 --> 02:24:19.205]  What's happened, Alex, uh, that a lot of folks, if they refuse a blood test, okay, that we need to get that evidence, a lot of hospitals don't want to get, take the blood for the department without a consent from the suspect because they don't want the liability.
[02:24:20.166 --> 02:24:24.689]  The Travis County Sheriff's Department is now talking to us that their nurses aren't going to draw blood for us anymore.
[02:24:24.689 --> 02:24:28.371]  They don't want their nurses to have to go to court and be tied up.
[02:24:28.371 --> 02:24:33.473]  So what's happened is we've got to look at how can we get evidence that we need of a crime that's been committed.
[02:24:33.473 --> 02:24:33.974]  Okay, leave it there.
[02:24:33.974 --> 02:24:35.675]  We'll come right back to you and let you continue.
[02:24:35.675 --> 02:24:37.315]  We have the Austin Police Chief on.
[02:24:37.315 --> 02:24:38.336]  It's amazing.
[02:24:38.336 --> 02:24:39.677]  We're really happy to have him here.
[02:24:39.677 --> 02:24:41.137]  He's Art Acevedo.
[02:24:41.137 --> 02:24:41.798]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:24:41.798 --> 02:24:46.260]  Stay with us.
[02:24:46.260 --> 02:24:47.641]  We're on the march.
[02:24:47.641 --> 02:24:49.162]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:24:50.154 --> 02:24:56.460]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:56.460 --> 02:25:04.387]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut.
[02:25:04.387 --> 02:25:09.611]  An entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.

[02:25:13.775 --> 02:25:20.639]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[02:25:20.639 --> 02:25:24.061]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[02:25:24.061 --> 02:25:25.822]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[02:25:25.822 --> 02:25:31.965]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[02:26:01.939 --> 02:26:05.241]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[02:26:05.241 --> 02:26:12.126]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[02:26:12.126 --> 02:26:14.228]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[02:26:14.728 --> 02:26:18.032]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[02:26:18.032 --> 02:26:22.817]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[02:26:22.817 --> 02:26:26.741]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[02:26:26.741 --> 02:26:28.363]  Travel less, meet online.

[02:26:56.016 --> 02:27:04.718]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on Earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[02:27:04.718 --> 02:27:09.839]  At HempUSA.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the U.S.
[02:27:09.839 --> 02:27:10.719]  and Canada.
[02:27:10.719 --> 02:27:17.241]  At HempUSA.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[02:27:17.802 --> 02:27:21.226]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[02:27:21.226 --> 02:27:23.648]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[02:28:06.761 --> 02:28:10.766]  Art Acevedo, Austin Police Chief, is our guest for the rest of the hour.
[02:28:10.766 --> 02:28:12.508]  Very charming devil, I have to say.
[02:28:12.508 --> 02:28:15.712]  We'll be watching him very closely from this time forward.
[02:28:15.712 --> 02:28:17.515]  Well, I think the feeling is mutual.
[02:28:17.515 --> 02:28:18.476]  You know what?
[02:28:18.476 --> 02:28:19.998]  You're a teddy bear person.
[02:28:19.998 --> 02:28:20.859]  I like watching you.
[02:28:20.859 --> 02:28:21.680]  I am a nice guy.
[02:28:21.880 --> 02:28:22.420]  You are a nice guy!
[02:28:22.420 --> 02:28:27.825]  I get intimidated by police that have been given federally paid Ford Darth Vader uniforms that aren't wearing badges.
[02:28:27.825 --> 02:28:37.092]  And you were talking earlier about seeing video of me on the web or TV or something where I'm going up to the police downtown who are in their riot gear and I'm just wanting to see their badges.
[02:28:37.092 --> 02:28:38.633]  That's why I was talking to them.
[02:28:39.090 --> 02:28:42.713]  Well let me tell you something about our badges that I think you'll probably like.
[02:28:42.713 --> 02:28:47.738]  We now have, don't look at mine, mine's unique, I'm the police chief, if you can't figure out who I am, we're in trouble.
[02:28:47.738 --> 02:28:52.202]  Our badges now have the, you know how you ask, hey do you have your badge number?
[02:28:52.202 --> 02:28:53.103]  Oh it says chief!
[02:28:53.103 --> 02:28:57.267]  Well mine does, but you know how you always say in the movies, hey copper, I want your badge number.
[02:28:57.887 --> 02:29:02.612]  Well, our employee numbers and our badge numbers were completely different, so it didn't mean anything.
[02:29:02.612 --> 02:29:07.438]  Now, with this new badge that we have, the employee number and the badge number will be one and the same.
[02:29:07.438 --> 02:29:08.499]  No, you're really changing things.
[02:29:08.499 --> 02:29:17.129]  I mean, now they're wearing the old-fashioned, nice, fancy, respectable uniforms, not like goon outfits, and they're driving black and whites, and you've got their badge numbers and a big badge.
[02:29:17.429 --> 02:29:32.236]  And a big badge, so there's no doubt, and it's not a generic badge, and you know what, we've got some good police officers, they deserve better, and I think they deserve, they earned this privilege, because wearing this uniform, wearing this badge is a privilege they have to earn every day they come to work, and I think they've earned the privilege of wearing a unique symbol.
[02:29:32.236 --> 02:29:35.918]  Yeah, why have a lot of departments the last 20 years gone into these maintenance uniforms?
[02:29:35.918 --> 02:29:38.919]  It looks like, you know, the maintenance guy at a university.
[02:29:39.199 --> 02:29:46.364]  I believe because you know what people are looking for comfort and we try to be the nice guy and if they want to be in there we're kind of going the opposite direction.
[02:29:46.364 --> 02:29:50.207]  We're trying to tighten it up a little bit where we want people looking professional.
[02:29:50.207 --> 02:30:00.955]  We're going to have some pants that are kind of like cargo pants but they're more tailored and they look cleaner for our guys on patrol and we want some uniformity so when you see an Austin police officer they all look the same.
[02:30:00.955 --> 02:30:05.178]  In the past we had white cars with a blue stripe now you're going to the old black and white.
[02:30:05.509 --> 02:30:06.129]  Black and white.
[02:30:06.129 --> 02:30:08.150]  You know, there's a lot of white cars in this town.
[02:30:08.150 --> 02:30:09.070]  Everybody drives a white car.
[02:30:09.070 --> 02:30:10.330]  No, they stand out now, you know.
[02:30:10.330 --> 02:30:11.051]  Yeah, and you know.
[02:30:11.051 --> 02:30:13.791]  And the lights are very bright.
[02:30:13.791 --> 02:30:19.333]  And I want our citizens to know when they see a black and white that that's a police car, it's an Austin police car, and they're out there taking care of them.
[02:30:19.333 --> 02:30:25.675]  Alright, going back to the blood issue, you guys can say, well, this is nothing new, we're getting a warrant.
[02:30:26.707 --> 02:30:38.893]  In Illinois, Indiana, and in some areas of Texas, I've read that the police are taking it at night out at the side of a road at a checkpoint, and that a lot of lawyers, and I've had the head of the Texas Bar on, are saying these aren't really real warrants that some of the cities have.
[02:30:38.893 --> 02:30:43.795]  It's a blank check warrant that basically the judges, just whatever's called in, are running with.
[02:30:43.795 --> 02:30:50.698]  Now, I haven't seen that claim with Austin, but still there are concerns here about people who are hemophiliacs, people who are diabetics.
[02:30:51.258 --> 02:30:57.402]  I mean, I've had blood taken for insurance or whatever, and the nurse can't seem to find it herself, much less some cop at the side of the road.
[02:30:57.402 --> 02:30:58.362]  That's quite a line to pass.
[02:30:58.362 --> 02:30:59.743]  But it's not going to be on the side of the road.
[02:30:59.743 --> 02:31:00.844]  I think that that's the image.
[02:31:00.844 --> 02:31:05.226]  You know, I looked at some of the blogs, I like to listen, I like to watch and read what's going on in my city.
[02:31:05.226 --> 02:31:10.730]  And some of the comments were, I'm not going to have a bubba cop sit there on the side of the road, you know, give me liberty or give me death.
[02:31:10.730 --> 02:31:12.811]  They've been doing that in Denver.
[02:31:13.211 --> 02:31:18.023]  Well, this is going to be a program that if we do launch it, it's in response to a need.
[02:31:18.023 --> 02:31:21.130]  We have to get that evidence to try to hold some of these folks in.
[02:31:21.130 --> 02:31:22.033]  But it is a federal grant!
[02:31:22.938 --> 02:31:24.238]  If I can get it.
[02:31:24.238 --> 02:31:26.039]  I don't know if I'll be able to get it.
[02:31:26.039 --> 02:31:36.861]  But it is to train a handful of police officers as phlebotomists that in an instance where we arrest somebody for driving under the influence, especially when they've killed somebody or seriously injured or maimed somebody.
[02:31:36.861 --> 02:31:39.882]  Remember that we've killed almost 2,000 Texans a year with drunk driving.
[02:31:39.882 --> 02:31:42.763]  We're the hardest drinking city according to Forbes.
[02:31:42.763 --> 02:31:44.503]  No, we're worse than New Orleans now.
[02:31:44.503 --> 02:31:46.404]  We sell the most alcohol.
[02:31:46.404 --> 02:31:52.225]  Listen, out in south of Austin, I was driving by, they've got a liquor store bigger than a Super Walmart.
[02:31:52.788 --> 02:32:11.987]  Oh yeah, and so Alex, I see you're a father, I'm a father, we're out here driving on these streets and these roadways, and there is carnage going on, and this is nothing more than using a lawful, and it will only be done in a lawful manner, in a sanitary condition, in a secure location, with some checks and balances.
[02:32:14.269 --> 02:32:23.858]  They shut down all of 35 from Kyle out to Round Rock, literally cars going one mile an hour, with police shining lights in people's eyes under a federal grant.
[02:32:23.858 --> 02:32:27.802]  Why would the feds want to give us this money that we've already paid for in taxes to do that?
[02:32:27.802 --> 02:32:29.704]  I mean, are we going to see stuff like that?
[02:32:29.704 --> 02:32:30.385]  No.
[02:32:30.385 --> 02:32:31.426]  We don't have checkpoints here.
[02:32:31.426 --> 02:32:36.050]  I think that you'd have to have a Texas legislature would have to approve checkpoints.
[02:32:36.050 --> 02:32:37.712]  But you heard about those big ones they had here, didn't you?
[02:32:37.712 --> 02:32:38.593]  No, I haven't heard about them.
[02:32:39.486 --> 02:32:41.448]  I'm the new guy, Alex!
[02:32:41.448 --> 02:32:42.289]  You're from L.A.
[02:32:42.289 --> 02:32:43.190]  I'm from L.A.
[02:32:43.190 --> 02:32:43.711]  I know.
[02:32:43.711 --> 02:32:44.932]  I'm from Texas now, buddy.
[02:32:44.932 --> 02:32:47.315]  The slick CIA command base.
[02:32:47.315 --> 02:32:48.536]  Is it L.A.?
[02:32:48.536 --> 02:32:49.818]  God, they can do better than that.
[02:32:49.818 --> 02:32:50.338]  What was your role?
[02:32:50.338 --> 02:32:51.299]  You were pretty high up in the L.A.
[02:32:51.299 --> 02:32:51.840]  Police Department.
[02:32:51.840 --> 02:32:53.402]  No, I was a California Patrol Chief.
[02:32:53.402 --> 02:32:55.204]  I was a state police officer.
[02:32:55.204 --> 02:32:57.446]  And then you were also a police chief somewhere else in Texas, weren't you?
[02:32:57.662 --> 02:32:59.363]  No.
[02:32:59.363 --> 02:33:01.504]  That's another Ace of Vito, I think.
[02:33:01.504 --> 02:33:09.648]  But the reality is, look, we have a responsibility to keep people alive, and we have a responsibility that when somebody kills somebody out there, seriously injures somebody, to hold them accountable.
[02:33:09.648 --> 02:33:10.809]  And I don't want people to think
[02:33:11.849 --> 02:33:13.710]  Look, you've got to realize where I started my life.
[02:33:13.710 --> 02:33:19.972]  I started my life in a communist dictatorship, and I hope you don't say you like Fidel Castro, because then those are fighting words with Cubans, okay?
[02:33:19.972 --> 02:33:22.373]  The reality is... Oh yeah, I'm a known communist.
[02:33:22.373 --> 02:33:22.633]  Are you?
[02:33:22.633 --> 02:33:24.274]  I didn't know that part!
[02:33:24.274 --> 02:33:26.895]  But the reality is, the reality is... That's a joke.
[02:33:26.895 --> 02:33:28.095]  I'm a Ron Paul guy, you know.
[02:33:28.095 --> 02:33:28.875]  No, I know.
[02:33:28.875 --> 02:33:32.277]  The reality is, I absolutely respect the Constitution.
[02:33:32.277 --> 02:33:38.679]  We are a nation of laws, and we will always abide by the rules that is set for us by the public.
[02:33:39.750 --> 02:33:40.651]  And by the legislature.
[02:33:40.651 --> 02:33:46.436]  Well, the problem is, the legislature tells Rick Perry you're not going to put these toll roads on existing roads, and he just says, I'm going to do it.
[02:33:46.436 --> 02:33:49.859]  Well, that's an issue for the legislature and Rick Perry to deal with.
[02:33:49.859 --> 02:33:53.361]  Okay, let's bring up the big issue then.
[02:33:53.361 --> 02:33:55.603]  You talk about drunk driving.
[02:33:55.603 --> 02:33:57.265]  And I've got hundreds of mainstream articles.
[02:33:57.265 --> 02:33:59.206]  I know you're aware of this.
[02:33:59.206 --> 02:34:00.407]  You keep saying that.
[02:34:00.407 --> 02:34:02.269]  Well, because you're a smart guy.
[02:34:02.269 --> 02:34:04.451]  But I'm saying, if you want me to pull you this up right now, I can.
[02:34:06.325 --> 02:34:07.445]  I'm just saying we document it.
[02:34:07.445 --> 02:34:10.646]  Claims I'm making are not claims, they're facts.
[02:34:10.646 --> 02:34:28.472]  Sheriffs, police chiefs, all over the country have said that they pull over a van, say with 15 illegal aliens in it, none of them have IDs, none of them have insurance, some of them are drunk, they pick them up, they take them in, ICE won't pick them up, the judges in the city say, $50 fines, we don't have any ID, we're letting them go.
[02:34:28.772 --> 02:34:33.294]  The famous railway serial killer killed a bunch of people, been going around for years, couldn't be caught.
[02:34:33.294 --> 02:34:35.896]  You talk about tracking things and having accountability.
[02:34:35.896 --> 02:34:43.179]  Citizens are having their plates scanned, face scanned, controlled, police everywhere, children spying on us in the schools.
[02:34:43.179 --> 02:34:49.242]  But then meanwhile, I know for a fact in Austin, Texas, and I've had a bunch of Austin police tell me this, and it happened.
[02:34:49.242 --> 02:34:50.143]  One night I pulled up.
[02:34:51.383 --> 02:34:59.288]  At this office, and I see two police cars and the lights going about a year and a half ago, and I walk up and my IT guy, he's actually a contractor, is in handcuffs.
[02:34:59.288 --> 02:35:00.949]  He goes, oh yeah, my license expired.
[02:35:00.949 --> 02:35:02.270]  I haven't got it renewed.
[02:35:02.270 --> 02:35:04.751]  And they said, yep, we're just having to arrest him.
[02:35:04.751 --> 02:35:07.613]  And I said, and it turned out the cops kind of bowled up when I first pulled up.
[02:35:07.613 --> 02:35:08.954]  And they said, oh, Alex Jones, how you doing?
[02:35:09.614 --> 02:35:10.474]  We're fans of the show.
[02:35:10.474 --> 02:35:11.995]  But then they went ahead and said, no, we've got to arrest him.
[02:35:11.995 --> 02:35:14.376]  And I said, but if he was an illegal alien, you probably wouldn't.
[02:35:14.376 --> 02:35:15.376]  And he says, you know what?
[02:35:15.376 --> 02:35:17.757]  They just let him go and we're not encouraged to do it.
[02:35:17.757 --> 02:35:21.179]  And Austin's a sanctuary city.
[02:35:21.179 --> 02:35:26.481]  So what do you say to that, claiming drunk drivers, when statistically, you talk about Austin being hard drinking.
[02:35:26.481 --> 02:35:29.162]  We know folks from south of the border are hard drinking too, just like Texans.
[02:35:29.795 --> 02:35:36.817]  Well, look, I've been talking about this on Spanish media and on Spanish radio, and it's from the day I got here.
[02:35:36.817 --> 02:35:43.319]  If you commit a crime in this city, if you commit a violation, I don't care if you're legal or illegal, we're going to enforce the law.
[02:35:43.319 --> 02:35:44.459]  That is our job.
[02:35:44.459 --> 02:35:48.741]  Now, this was a year and a half ago, but why did the officers tell me they weren't supposed to arrest them a year and a half ago?
[02:35:48.741 --> 02:35:52.382]  You know what, some of it may be their own perception.
[02:35:52.382 --> 02:35:59.644]  The reality is, when we take enforcement action, we base it on the statutes and the ordinances in the city, without regard to socioeconomic standing.
[02:35:59.744 --> 02:36:01.225]  Is this a sanctuary city?
[02:36:01.225 --> 02:36:02.906]  It's listed as one.
[02:36:02.906 --> 02:36:08.751]  This is not a sanctuary city, because when we book people at the jail, ICE has access to the jail.
[02:36:08.751 --> 02:36:09.571]  They don't come, do they?
[02:36:09.571 --> 02:36:19.699]  What do you do when you don't know who somebody is, and there's been a stabbing, and you've got three witnesses, and it's hard to prosecute, because nobody knows who these people are?
[02:36:19.699 --> 02:36:23.282]  And also, then that victimizes these communities, because they're lawless.
[02:36:23.282 --> 02:36:23.942]  Well, absolutely.
[02:36:26.224 --> 02:36:27.986]  There's two things here that are happening.
[02:36:27.986 --> 02:36:31.129]  First of all, immigration control starts at the border.
[02:36:31.129 --> 02:36:32.550]  You've got to secure your borders.
[02:36:32.550 --> 02:36:40.417]  I think that most major city chiefs, that is actually a policy position of the major city chiefs here in the country, is that we've got to secure our borders.
[02:36:40.417 --> 02:36:44.901]  The second part, though, is that we have to be serious about it, because here's the unintended consequence.
[02:36:44.901 --> 02:36:50.547]  If I become, actually it's an unfounded mandate for me to be doing ICE's work or immigration's work.
[02:36:51.107 --> 02:36:52.588]  But here's the problem.
[02:36:52.588 --> 02:37:01.895]  If there is a revolving door where three days after you get them, if we became an arm of immigration, they're going to be right back.
[02:37:01.895 --> 02:37:10.382]  What can happen is that we lose the trust of that community that's going to be here, and we lose witnesses, we lose victims, and we all lose.
[02:37:10.382 --> 02:37:17.908]  I have friends that work for the federal government in California, in Southern California, that used to be frustrated that they'd take people down on the bus
[02:37:18.854 --> 02:37:23.636]  And the joke was that the people that were deported beat the bus back to downtown L.A.
[02:37:23.636 --> 02:37:26.596]  Well, they also kill police, federal police.
[02:37:26.596 --> 02:37:29.697]  They commit murders, and Mexico will not extradite back to the U.S.
[02:37:29.697 --> 02:37:31.118]  if there's a death penalty.
[02:37:31.118 --> 02:37:33.119]  So, I mean, this is literally like the Wild West.
[02:37:33.119 --> 02:37:35.539]  You know about the rocket attacks in Nuevo Laredo.
[02:37:35.539 --> 02:37:37.320]  You know about the truck bomb in Dallas.
[02:37:37.320 --> 02:37:45.843]  You know about Los Zetas paramilitary Mexican troops are now, and I reported this three years before it hit the mainstream, are now carrying out operations.
[02:37:45.843 --> 02:37:46.963]  The police are scared of them.
[02:37:47.583 --> 02:37:53.124]  MS-13, I mean, it's... and then meanwhile, my guy's got an expired license, he's off to jail.
[02:37:53.124 --> 02:38:01.746]  Well, again, our official position here is that if you break the law, if you violate the law, we're going to treat you the same, whether you're legal or illegal, you're going to go to jail.
[02:38:01.746 --> 02:38:07.028]  So what do you do when you pull an illegal alien over who's driving a car and they don't have insurance?
[02:38:07.028 --> 02:38:08.508]  I mean, how do you write them a ticket if you don't know who they are?
[02:38:09.096 --> 02:38:15.240]  Well, if you cannot reasonably identify who a person is, then you take them forthwith and get them identified.
[02:38:15.240 --> 02:38:18.843]  So you are taking people to jail who you don't know who they are?
[02:38:18.843 --> 02:38:24.047]  Our policy allows our officers that if you cannot identify a person, you can go forthwith.
[02:38:24.047 --> 02:38:25.848]  But see, that's their discretion.
[02:38:25.848 --> 02:38:26.869]  You can go forth.
[02:38:27.429 --> 02:38:34.191]  I mean, yeah, but the police are encouraged to go out and write tickets and generate revenue on the almost broke-back city, even though we're a wealthy city.
[02:38:34.191 --> 02:38:37.852]  But meanwhile, you see, I mean, look, look, let's be honest, Chief.
[02:38:37.852 --> 02:38:39.552]  You know and I know there's a double standard.
[02:38:39.552 --> 02:38:47.154]  There's a double standard to 867 sanctuary cities, and Austin is on the map as one of the worst in the country after L.A., Denver, Chicago.
[02:38:47.154 --> 02:38:53.015]  We've got a Mexican consulate, our mission here, which hands out these Cracker Jack matricula.
[02:38:55.956 --> 02:39:03.409]  I mean, I had the leader of the Republican Senate on a few years ago, and he in one day himself went and got four fake IDs from a Mexican consulate.
[02:39:04.141 --> 02:39:16.967]  Well, it is a challenge, but you know, the problem for us as police officers at a local level is policing a community that we know is here and policing a community that, you know, we don't control the borders.
[02:39:16.967 --> 02:39:19.609]  We have to control what's in our city.
[02:39:19.609 --> 02:39:29.774]  And I think some of the frustration is that the reality is the way that you deal with immigration is you dry up jobs, you dry up some of those opportunities, people wouldn't come here illegally.
[02:39:31.187 --> 02:39:33.829]  To me, if you're going to get serious, that's where you start, is with employers.
[02:39:33.829 --> 02:39:36.311]  Oh, I agree.
[02:39:36.311 --> 02:39:41.935]  Plus, just as a citizen, I want people to be able to have entry-level jobs, no matter what color they are.
[02:39:41.935 --> 02:39:44.937]  We've got hundreds of millions of people that want to come here.
[02:39:44.937 --> 02:39:46.899]  And the states are already bankrupt.
[02:39:46.899 --> 02:39:53.223]  The hospitals, one weekend I cut my finger off on accident to help some people with their boat out in Lake Travis.
[02:39:53.223 --> 02:39:54.024]  It was flopping around.
[02:39:54.608 --> 02:40:01.630]  And so the ambulance took me down to the city hospital, and there was just rows of illegal aliens in there who had no insurance.
[02:40:01.630 --> 02:40:05.771]  Well, that might be an assumption, just because they look Hispanic, how do you know they're illegal aliens?
[02:40:05.771 --> 02:40:06.851]  No, no, I was listening.
[02:40:06.851 --> 02:40:13.553]  I was sitting there with my hand wrapped up, with it hanging by a piece of skin, and my dad, who's a physician there, saying he needs to get this attached fast.
[02:40:13.553 --> 02:40:14.973]  I've called him, he drove down.
[02:40:14.973 --> 02:40:17.554]  And I'm sitting there, but it wasn't just that, it was poor people.
[02:40:17.694 --> 02:40:23.198]  It was a Sunday full of poor people who were so poor they don't have insurance.
[02:40:23.198 --> 02:40:28.862]  And then about half of them were, you know, because I was watching, they'd go up and they'd say, do you have insurance?
[02:40:28.862 --> 02:40:29.443]  Do you have an ID?
[02:40:29.443 --> 02:40:29.763]  No.
[02:40:29.763 --> 02:40:30.824]  Well, who are you?
[02:40:30.824 --> 02:40:36.368]  And then because they knew that they weren't going to have insurance but they needed to provide care, which I'm saying is good, they went right through.
[02:40:36.368 --> 02:40:44.434]  My point is the country is breaking down and we need to not give third world populations special status or it's going to destroy this country.
[02:40:44.434 --> 02:40:45.975]  I'm all for immigrants coming to this nation.
[02:40:46.255 --> 02:40:49.117]  I mean, you were born in Cuba, fleeing communism.
[02:40:49.117 --> 02:40:50.778]  Well, we applied to come here.
[02:40:50.778 --> 02:40:53.239]  No, I know, but I'm all for that's what I'm saying, Chief.
[02:40:53.239 --> 02:40:54.160]  But here's the issue, though.
[02:40:54.160 --> 02:40:56.181]  There are some unintended consequences.
[02:40:56.181 --> 02:41:02.285]  Remember now, the job of immigration enforcement lies primarily with the federal government.
[02:41:02.285 --> 02:41:03.646]  It's their job.
[02:41:03.646 --> 02:41:13.592]  We have people here that keep arguing we shouldn't arrest people that are committing burglaries, we can't keep the burglars, the rapists, all these other folks in jail because there's no jail space.
[02:41:13.592 --> 02:41:14.913]  If ICE isn't going to pick them up,
[02:41:16.041 --> 02:41:16.702]  We're good to go.
[02:41:32.722 --> 02:41:37.245]  We lose, potentially, 10 million witnesses to crime.
[02:41:37.245 --> 02:41:50.252]  One of our kids gets kidnapped at the bus stop, and the little old lady that's the child care attendant for somebody that they hired... Now they're afraid to call the local cop, and they might be... The ambulance system actually works, I think you know that.
[02:41:51.412 --> 02:41:54.013]  And the West Coast has had a 100% recovery rate.
[02:41:54.013 --> 02:41:55.054]  It is a great system.
[02:41:55.054 --> 02:42:00.417]  Yeah, but now they're going to use it, you know, for flashing, call terrorist tip line, don't water your yard on Tuesdays.
[02:42:00.417 --> 02:42:05.139]  Well, no, you can't get crazy with that because it waters it down.
[02:42:05.139 --> 02:42:07.140]  People lose interest and it loses its effectiveness.
[02:42:07.140 --> 02:42:08.721]  But that's one of the unintended consequences.
[02:42:08.721 --> 02:42:14.463]  If people start becoming afraid of calling the cops, the cops aren't going to take enforcement action against somebody.
[02:42:14.463 --> 02:42:17.525]  The next time they victimize somebody, it may be you or me or someone else.
[02:42:17.805 --> 02:42:29.697]  So we, it has to be a comprehensive approach that starts with securing our border, making sure that people can only get jobs if they're here legally, if they're serious about it, but it really is a federal issue that they've got to be the ones that take the lead on it.
[02:42:29.697 --> 02:42:37.225]  Well Chief Acevedo, I agree with a lot of what you're saying about how it should be federal, about how it should be enforced against employers.
[02:42:37.225 --> 02:42:40.028]  It's very hypocritical to arrest these immigrants and
[02:42:40.528 --> 02:42:43.211]  Treat them bad, and believe me, I know how bad Mexico is.
[02:42:43.211 --> 02:42:46.454]  In Mexico City, 30 million people, half of them living in cardboard boxes.
[02:42:46.454 --> 02:42:47.494]  It's hell on earth.
[02:42:47.494 --> 02:42:49.096]  The problem is this country is like a lifeboat.
[02:42:49.096 --> 02:42:55.021]  That will pull the boat completely down if we just say unlimited and the crime, and then give them a double standard.
[02:42:55.021 --> 02:42:59.105]  And I understand this rationale, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[02:42:59.725 --> 02:43:11.232]  And to just say we have to have this interface with the community, and so we have to go with kid gloves, I'm saying there's not kid gloves with me, because I'm seen as the big fat milk cow.
[02:43:11.232 --> 02:43:16.675]  I'm seen as the dumb American driving around in their SUV.
[02:43:16.675 --> 02:43:17.915]  Trust me, you're not seen as a dumb guy.
[02:43:17.915 --> 02:43:21.577]  You're seen as a very bright, articulate, well-informed individual.
[02:43:21.577 --> 02:43:23.398]  But I'm talking about the citizens.
[02:43:23.398 --> 02:43:26.200]  Citizens are seen as the milk cow to be sucked.
[02:43:26.740 --> 02:43:30.044]  Well, but here's the issue.
[02:43:30.044 --> 02:43:32.507]  Plain devil's advocate to your position.
[02:43:32.507 --> 02:43:41.939]  If I get involved and just start asking people for your papers solely for the reason to see if they're here legally or not, and they get deported and three days later they're back,
[02:43:43.795 --> 02:43:50.139]  And now that same person in the future sees a crime as a victim of crime and they will no longer want to cooperate with me.
[02:43:50.139 --> 02:43:52.420]  How has public safety been enhanced?
[02:43:52.420 --> 02:43:53.841]  Well, I want to be clear.
[02:43:53.841 --> 02:44:03.286]  I think if somebody, there should be an amnesty in that if someone comes in to report a crime, it's policy and it's advertised that if you come in seeing a stabbing or a shooting or a robbery... That's a new visa.
[02:44:03.286 --> 02:44:04.467]  That's actually in law now.
[02:44:04.467 --> 02:44:04.887]  Yeah, but...
[02:44:06.843 --> 02:44:20.188]  The Austin cops have told me, and I've sat around at bars and restaurants with them, I've got friends that are cops, I've worked out with cops, and they go, yeah, we're basically told and encouraged, we get in trouble, we get, you know, start getting demerits for other issues, if we drag in a bunch of illegal aliens.
[02:44:20.188 --> 02:44:21.168]  It's wrong, it's wrong!
[02:44:21.168 --> 02:44:25.430]  But you need to know something about cop culture.
[02:44:25.430 --> 02:44:33.953]  Cops sometimes talk out of school a lot, where they'll start telling you, and they're talking stories, or talking shop, and you gotta take sometimes... Oh, now we can't believe the cops!
[02:44:34.953 --> 02:44:41.877]  You're out there at the bar, you're mentioning bars, you're mentioning drinks, you know, next thing you know they got the biggest fish that they caught when they went fishing.
[02:44:41.877 --> 02:44:48.321]  You gotta take it with a little grain of salt when you're telling stories because there's a lot of urban legends and myths and everything else that goes into it.
[02:44:48.321 --> 02:44:51.402]  Police Chief Art Acevedo, he is a slick one ladies and gentlemen.
[02:44:51.402 --> 02:44:52.243]  What are you talking about?
[02:44:52.663 --> 02:45:08.543]  But the reality is, we will not, when my cop makes an unlawful arrest, I don't care if the person is legal or illegal, our position is we expect them to take the proper enforcement action, irregardless of the person's status.
[02:45:08.543 --> 02:45:09.464]  And that's the best I can do.
[02:45:09.844 --> 02:45:12.367]  Okay, so police listening right now, and they listen to this show.
[02:45:12.367 --> 02:45:12.988]  We're on 90.1, 1330, 590.
[02:45:12.988 --> 02:45:16.131]  We're going to re-air this.
[02:45:16.131 --> 02:45:17.092]  They're hearing you.
[02:45:17.092 --> 02:45:21.297]  They pull somebody over, and there's beer cans in the back.
[02:45:21.297 --> 02:45:23.019]  There's no ID, no insurance.
[02:45:23.019 --> 02:45:23.420]  What happens?
[02:45:24.175 --> 02:45:28.057]  You take the appropriate enforcement action, regardless of what they're... But what is that?
[02:45:28.057 --> 02:45:31.138]  You're saying you leave it up to them.
[02:45:31.138 --> 02:45:34.359]  If it's an offense where it's a ticket, you write a ticket.
[02:45:34.359 --> 02:45:36.660]  If it's an offense where they're supposed to go to jail, you take them to jail.
[02:45:36.660 --> 02:45:38.201]  But how do you write a ticket if you don't know who they are?
[02:45:38.201 --> 02:45:40.382]  They arrested my guy because you didn't have an ID.
[02:45:40.382 --> 02:45:43.703]  If you don't know who they are and you can't identify them, there's tactics.
[02:45:43.703 --> 02:45:47.785]  I'm not going to give you the tactics on how to... People can't get their story straight half the time.
[02:45:47.785 --> 02:45:50.186]  There's ways to get information, identify people.
[02:45:51.267 --> 02:45:51.827]  Stay there, sir.
[02:45:51.827 --> 02:45:54.469]  Final segment coming up with the Austin Police Chief.
[02:45:54.469 --> 02:45:55.189]  This has been great.
[02:45:55.189 --> 02:45:56.590]  Stay with us.
[02:45:56.590 --> 02:45:58.552]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:45:58.552 --> 02:46:05.517]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:46:05.517 --> 02:46:13.923]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:46:13.923 --> 02:46:19.647]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:46:19.847 --> 02:46:21.652]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:46:21.652 --> 02:46:23.838]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:46:23.838 --> 02:46:27.849]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:46:29.991 --> 02:46:31.973]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[02:47:00.012 --> 02:47:02.814]  I feel I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[02:47:29.673 --> 02:47:30.574]  Attention please!
[02:47:30.574 --> 02:47:32.977]  I've come with a message of information.
[02:47:32.977 --> 02:47:35.220]  9-11 was an inside job.
[02:47:35.220 --> 02:47:36.782]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[02:47:36.782 --> 02:47:38.485]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[02:47:38.485 --> 02:47:41.388]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[02:47:41.388 --> 02:47:45.013]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[02:47:54.663 --> 02:47:59.812]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[02:47:59.812 --> 02:48:03.358]  An inside job?
[02:48:03.358 --> 02:48:04.280]  How dare you?
[02:48:06.647 --> 02:48:07.407]  9-11!
[02:48:07.407 --> 02:48:11.009]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[02:48:11.009 --> 02:48:13.731]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[02:48:13.731 --> 02:48:20.214]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[02:48:25.317 --> 02:48:27.798]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[02:48:28.487 --> 02:48:31.369]  Have you heard about American Free Press?
[02:48:31.369 --> 02:48:32.970]  American Free Press.
[02:48:32.970 --> 02:48:37.494]  The only national newspaper that endorsed Ron Paul for president.
[02:48:37.494 --> 02:48:39.215]  American Free Press.
[02:48:39.215 --> 02:48:42.217]  Written by patriots, for patriots.
[02:48:42.217 --> 02:48:44.979]  Standing firm for our Constitution.
[02:48:44.979 --> 02:48:47.982]  Standing firm against the New World Order.
[02:48:47.982 --> 02:48:50.263]  Hammering the enemies of freedom.
[02:48:50.263 --> 02:48:52.545]  Exposing the intrigues of the global elite.
[02:48:53.346 --> 02:49:01.370]  American Free Press hits the Bilderbergers and Trilateralists, and the whole Council on Foreign Relations gang head-on.
[02:49:01.370 --> 02:49:03.831]  Here's your chance to catch up with the news from...
[02:49:09.434 --> 02:49:14.358]  Police Chief Art Acevedo is our guest for this segment and one more.
[02:49:14.358 --> 02:49:17.300]  We're really honored to have him with us.
[02:49:17.300 --> 02:49:19.802]  During the break we were having a really animated discussion.
[02:49:19.802 --> 02:49:26.227]  I said, hey, what I don't want is what you grew up in in Cuba, what you fought to leave, and we're glad to have people who love freedom in this country.
[02:49:26.587 --> 02:49:31.329]  And our arms are totally open to that, and we need people that have experienced tyranny so they can fight against it here.
[02:49:31.329 --> 02:49:38.192]  But having children spy on their parents, it always starts out, oh for drugs, or if you're being abused, or if you're this or you're that.
[02:49:38.192 --> 02:49:39.653]  I mean, I've gone and I've seen the abuses.
[02:49:39.653 --> 02:49:45.476]  I've seen CPS snatch people's babies and then lie on the forums because I was there and take them for adoption.
[02:49:45.476 --> 02:49:47.737]  I know that the system's gotten predatory.
[02:49:48.437 --> 02:49:53.379]  And I'm sure you're a nice guy, and a good guy, and a smart guy, and you see the good in what's happening.
[02:49:53.379 --> 02:49:54.940]  I see a lot of the bad.
[02:49:54.940 --> 02:50:02.863]  And I know that we're becoming more like a Cuba, more like a Soviet Union, more like East Germany, with the spying, the control, all of this.
[02:50:02.863 --> 02:50:04.623]  And it isn't for our security.
[02:50:04.623 --> 02:50:07.044]  I read the RAND Corporation documents.
[02:50:07.044 --> 02:50:08.865]  I know how they're federalizing departments.
[02:50:08.865 --> 02:50:09.986]  I know the larger plan.
[02:50:09.986 --> 02:50:13.267]  They've got a lot of guys like you who are well-meaning and bust their butts.
[02:50:13.747 --> 02:50:15.808]  Trying to protect people, and a lot of good's done.
[02:50:15.808 --> 02:50:17.789]  But overall, the federal state's growing.
[02:50:17.789 --> 02:50:18.810]  The control's growing.
[02:50:18.810 --> 02:50:22.511]  So, I'd like you to speak to that, Chief.
[02:50:22.511 --> 02:50:27.314]  And again, we appreciate you graciously coming in and being interrogated.
[02:50:27.314 --> 02:50:29.535]  Your allegiance stands with the state and the city, doesn't it?
[02:50:29.535 --> 02:50:31.936]  I mean, your allegiance stands with the Bill of Rights Constitution?
[02:50:32.614 --> 02:50:33.774]  Absolutely.
[02:50:33.774 --> 02:50:47.999]  When we take our oath of office, we take an oath to the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of Texas, and my job is really, my number one concern is the welfare and the safety of the people that live, visit, and work in Austin.
[02:50:47.999 --> 02:50:50.000]  That's the bottom line.
[02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:50.580]  Absolutely.
[02:50:52.026 --> 02:51:00.671]  I mean, expanding on that though, we were privately talking about, you know, you're saying you don't want America to be a police state, you're saying you don't want it to be like Cuba, I don't want to paraphrase what you were saying, do you want to elaborate?
[02:51:00.671 --> 02:51:17.761]  Well, I think that you have to, you don't ever want to be in a situation where in Cuba, they want to know what your parents were thinking, what was their train of thought, do they speak out against the government, we never want to be in that kind of place, because my father used to tell us when we got to this country, from here to the moon, there's no better place on earth, and I would hope that... Now look at you now!
[02:51:18.241 --> 02:51:20.042]  Well, and you know, that's why I love this country.
[02:51:20.042 --> 02:51:21.643]  I mean, it's the best country.
[02:51:21.643 --> 02:51:25.425]  With all of our wars and everything, there's no other place I'd rather live than the United States of America.
[02:51:25.425 --> 02:51:30.507]  It's the greatest place on earth, and I'm hoping to... I agree, but I want to defend what it is.
[02:51:30.507 --> 02:51:45.334]  I mean, America is the Bill of Rights, Constitution, Declaration of Independence, and, you know, we're having our liberties taken, and there's always these good reasons, there's always these excuses, you know, there's always... I was talking to you during the break about the Tenth Amendment, and you were saying, well, the Civil War decided that.
[02:51:45.794 --> 02:51:50.956]  Well, yeah, and then Reconstruction decided that, but I mean, is there no end to the federal power?
[02:51:50.956 --> 02:51:54.138]  Well, you know, again, you're talking about the police chief here in Austin, Texas.
[02:51:54.138 --> 02:51:57.559]  I try to keep my focus on my local issues.
[02:51:57.559 --> 02:52:11.566]  I don't have anybody in the federal government dictating to me how to police this city, and the bottom line is that I work for the city leaders and for the people of the city of Austin, and my allegiance is obviously to my city and my country.
[02:52:12.987 --> 02:52:21.591]  One of them was a huge terror attack somewhere in the United States, and they said that we have to implement PDD 51, basically making the President a dictator.
[02:52:21.591 --> 02:52:30.095]  What would you do then if they gave you a list, and they have these, it's been in the Houston Chronicle now, of 3,000 Austinites to be picked up, and Alex Jones is on there.
[02:52:30.095 --> 02:52:34.877]  And there's no judge, no jury, no indictment, no grand jury, it's just go pick up Alex Jones.
[02:52:34.877 --> 02:52:37.358]  We'd say, Alex Jones, we know him, we're going to vouch for him.
[02:52:38.098 --> 02:52:42.401]  But the reality is we'll cross that bridge when we get there.
[02:52:42.401 --> 02:52:44.222]  You'll cross the bridge to follow up?
[02:52:44.222 --> 02:52:50.606]  No, to figure out if it's a lawful order and we'll make that decision based on what we know to be right.
[02:52:50.606 --> 02:52:53.068]  I mean, we got the city to throw out the Patriot Act here locally.
[02:52:54.022 --> 02:52:55.323]  You know, to say that we oppose it.
[02:52:55.323 --> 02:53:08.554]  So the bottom line, just remember, we are a local police department, we are a separate entity, and we will operate based upon what our own city statutes are and our requirements are.
[02:53:08.554 --> 02:53:17.060]  But we know that they've trained the police to drive the buses and pick up people during riots, and we know they have the emergency center out at the old airport, the overflow center.
[02:53:17.060 --> 02:53:18.602]  Is that still there with the bolts and chains on the floor?
[02:53:19.457 --> 02:53:20.938]  I haven't seen it since I've been here.
[02:53:20.938 --> 02:53:22.480]  But are you aware of that?
[02:53:22.480 --> 02:53:23.761]  There's a Bolton change where?
[02:53:23.761 --> 02:53:26.443]  The little FEMA camp they've got at the old Mueller Airport.
[02:53:26.443 --> 02:53:27.223]  I haven't seen it, no.
[02:53:27.223 --> 02:53:28.144]  You went to Poland?
[02:53:28.144 --> 02:53:31.207]  But you know what, the old airport, I think that's pretty much been torn down.
[02:53:31.207 --> 02:53:32.087]  Privatized, yeah.
[02:53:32.087 --> 02:53:33.368]  I'll tell you what, stay there.
[02:53:33.368 --> 02:53:37.092]  One minute break, Chief.
[02:53:37.092 --> 02:53:37.752]  Okay.
[02:53:37.752 --> 02:53:40.294]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:53:40.294 --> 02:53:41.415]  I'm a local guy.
[02:53:41.415 --> 02:53:43.297]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:53:44.452 --> 02:53:49.338]  ...during riots, and we know they have the emergency center out at the old airport, the overflow center.
[02:53:49.338 --> 02:53:51.121]  Is that still there with the Bolton chain?
[02:53:51.121 --> 02:53:54.365]  ...worldwide, but in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:53:54.365 --> 02:53:57.388]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:53:57.388 --> 02:53:59.291]  It is essential that patriots worldwide...
[02:53:59.571 --> 02:54:03.112]  Accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:54:03.112 --> 02:54:07.354]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[02:54:07.354 --> 02:54:12.556]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.TV is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[02:54:12.556 --> 02:54:15.597]  PrisonPlanet.TV is a vault of forbidden information.

[02:54:44.435 --> 02:54:45.195]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:54:48.988 --> 02:54:51.390]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:54:51.390 --> 02:55:13.065]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:55:13.065 --> 02:55:16.847]  Well, I have been interrogating him and I'd like to give him the last five minutes
[02:55:18.740 --> 02:55:23.182]  Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo to talk about whatever he thinks is most important.
[02:55:23.182 --> 02:55:25.183]  To get out any websites or any points he's making.
[02:55:25.183 --> 02:55:27.384]  I would like to see other police chiefs across the country.
[02:55:27.384 --> 02:55:33.107]  We're on in Chicago, LA, San Diego, Kansas City, other places.
[02:55:33.107 --> 02:55:35.468]  If you want to come on this show, you are welcome.
[02:55:35.468 --> 02:55:46.053]  We'd love to hear from you here as well, because one thing that will fight tyranny is the people truly being involved in their government and being friends with the police, but not in a spy way, but in the way you're doing it.
[02:55:46.053 --> 02:55:47.854]  And so it humanizes both sides.
[02:55:48.496 --> 02:55:59.643]  Well, again, I think familiarity breeds trust and respect, and the reality is at least we know each other's positions, and we don't have to agree on everything, but we can agree to disagree.
[02:55:59.643 --> 02:56:01.944]  Please don't take me to the FEMA camp.
[02:56:01.944 --> 02:56:03.385]  No, we have a special lock-up for you.
[02:56:03.385 --> 02:56:04.866]  I'm kidding.
[02:56:04.866 --> 02:56:07.088]  Trust me, we don't have any black helicopters following you around.
[02:56:07.088 --> 02:56:08.909]  I only have one helicopter, for God's sakes.
[02:56:08.909 --> 02:56:10.630]  I'm trying to get a second.
[02:56:10.630 --> 02:56:12.411]  I know, it buzzes my house daily.
[02:56:13.795 --> 02:56:16.517]  That must be Tank, one of our guys with a good sense of humor.
[02:56:16.517 --> 02:56:18.578]  The reality is we have a great police department here in Austin.
[02:56:18.578 --> 02:56:20.159]  We live in a great city.
[02:56:20.159 --> 02:56:27.344]  Our goal, though, is that we don't want to be naive to think that things can't worsen for us in terms of crime if we don't stay on top of it.
[02:56:27.344 --> 02:56:29.025]  We want to be proactive.
[02:56:29.025 --> 02:56:30.566]  We want to be aggressive.
[02:56:30.566 --> 02:56:32.468]  But we want to be respectful of people's rights.
[02:56:32.468 --> 02:56:37.771]  And most importantly, we want to make sure that everybody's treated the same and equally that lives here.
[02:56:37.771 --> 02:56:41.153]  But the last thing I want to say is something I'm very proud of and make the public aware of.
[02:56:41.153 --> 02:56:43.475]  We have now brought back our Police Activities League.
[02:56:44.075 --> 02:56:46.257]  Which is a great program for kids.
[02:56:46.257 --> 02:56:50.719]  We're not going to ask them about how their parents are doing and whether they're talking about us or anything else.
[02:56:50.719 --> 02:56:55.382]  But we're losing about 50%, over 50% of our kids that are dropping out of high school.
[02:56:55.382 --> 02:56:57.023]  To me that's the greatest threat.
[02:56:58.001 --> 02:57:00.823]  No, our society is unraveling.
[02:57:00.823 --> 02:57:03.585]  And it starts with kids not graduating from school.
[02:57:03.585 --> 02:57:05.366]  We're doing our little share here.
[02:57:05.366 --> 02:57:10.470]  I would hope that your listeners would know that we're having a Police Activities League lock-up towards the end of the month here.
[02:57:10.470 --> 02:57:20.317]  They can go to our website at the Police Department and please support our Explorer program where kids can learn about being police officers, what that field is like.
[02:57:20.317 --> 02:57:22.339]  They can learn how to take me to a FEMA camp.
[02:57:22.830 --> 02:57:24.371]  We're not taking you to a FEMA camp.
[02:57:24.371 --> 02:57:26.333]  You'd be bored!
[02:57:26.333 --> 02:57:28.835]  You just said that the cops like to listen to you, and I know I've listened to you.
[02:57:28.835 --> 02:57:29.335]  I'm joking!
[02:57:29.335 --> 02:57:30.196]  What do we do with you?
[02:57:30.196 --> 02:57:33.279]  But the reality is, we have got to invest in kids, Alex.
[02:57:33.279 --> 02:57:35.320]  You know that the kids are our future.
[02:57:35.320 --> 02:57:50.513]  We've got a lot of kids that their parents are working, nobody's ever around, they have no adult supervision, and in the Austin Police Department, through our Explorer Program and our Police Activities League, we want to make a difference in kids' lives, and I hope your listeners will contact us to help donate funds, and more importantly, maybe even help volunteer.
[02:57:51.348 --> 02:57:58.374]  And then, so you want my listeners, basically because they'll be spying on you, you know that, to come in and get involved with the department.
[02:57:58.374 --> 02:57:59.936]  Hey, look, we have nothing to hide.
[02:57:59.936 --> 02:58:00.977]  Well, I'll say this.
[02:58:00.977 --> 02:58:03.099]  That is the answer to take this government back.
[02:58:03.099 --> 02:58:09.885]  We have 60% on average people coming out for presidential elections, but 8% local elections nationally on average.
[02:58:09.885 --> 02:58:13.508]  We need to get that up to 80% locally, and if good people get involved in government,
[02:58:14.349 --> 02:58:19.310]  We're going to end up having the police chiefs and the mayors and the sheriffs, and then it's going to be our government.
[02:58:19.310 --> 02:58:24.911]  We have handed over our responsibility, turned it over to the feds, and I've told the listeners, that is the responsibility.
[02:58:24.911 --> 02:58:31.993]  If the people get involved and you know you're a good person, then that'll block the control freaks that are trying to get involved in government.
[02:58:31.993 --> 02:58:34.573]  We've let all the control freaks take over the government.
[02:58:34.573 --> 02:58:37.374]  You're starting to talk Texas in there for a minute, with letting.
[02:58:37.374 --> 02:58:38.134]  But look, just to know this.
[02:58:38.134 --> 02:58:38.554]  Fixing.
[02:58:38.554 --> 02:58:39.054]  Yeah, fixing.
[02:58:39.054 --> 02:58:40.634]  We're going to fix the fixing things.
[02:58:40.634 --> 02:58:42.835]  Just remember, this is my perspective about my role.
[02:58:43.815 --> 02:58:50.036]  Ultimately, Matt, whatever happens in this city that impacts public safety, the federal government isn't going to answer to that.
[02:58:50.036 --> 02:58:51.676]  The state isn't going to answer to that.
[02:58:51.676 --> 02:58:57.978]  The chief of police of Austin, Texas is going to answer to Austinites because I work for them and there is no excuse.
[02:58:57.978 --> 02:58:59.638]  We have to stay on top of issues.
[02:58:59.638 --> 02:59:01.678]  But know this, we are here to serve.
[02:59:01.678 --> 02:59:03.079]  We have nothing to hide.
[02:59:03.079 --> 02:59:06.779]  We're a transparent organization and we're not afraid to answer the tough questions.
[02:59:06.779 --> 02:59:08.860]  Well, I have said this, things have changed since you've been here.
[02:59:08.860 --> 02:59:10.080]  We're seeing changes everywhere.
[02:59:10.720 --> 02:59:16.605]  But I just want you to realize, those governing the federal government do not have the same altruistic goals of you, I will assure you.
[02:59:16.605 --> 02:59:20.408]  I mean, look at all the chemical and biological and radiological testing they've done on the American people.
[02:59:20.408 --> 02:59:21.869]  Do you know about Tuskegee and all that?
[02:59:21.869 --> 02:59:26.973]  I mean, the point is, let's stop completely trusting government as well, let's get involved in government.
[02:59:26.973 --> 02:59:34.118]  I want to skip this three minute break, so we have three more minutes with the Chief for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, InfoWars.com listeners.
[02:59:34.118 --> 02:59:35.980]  Well, we're going to go ahead and go live during the break.
[02:59:36.260 --> 02:59:41.022]  For the AM and FM affiliates, we say bye to Chief Art Acevedo.
[02:59:41.022 --> 02:59:47.425]  Right now, we'll be back with Pastor Chuck Baldwin running for president of the Constitution Party on the other side of this break.
[02:59:47.425 --> 02:59:54.268]  But for those behind the scenes, we'll have three minutes left with Art Acevedo, the Austin Police Chief, who certainly is changing things.
[02:59:56.081 --> 02:59:59.484]  Okay, I'm going to go back to the Chief now, John.
[02:59:59.484 --> 03:00:00.025]  Thank you.
[03:00:00.025 --> 03:00:01.887]  We're going to continue here with the three minutes we've got.
[03:00:01.887 --> 03:00:02.847]  I want to thank you for coming in.
[03:00:02.847 --> 03:00:03.228]  No problem.
[03:00:03.228 --> 03:00:04.789]  It was really, really fun to meet you.
[03:00:04.789 --> 03:00:06.110]  Can I have you back in every few months?
[03:00:06.110 --> 03:00:06.731]  Absolutely.
[03:00:06.731 --> 03:00:08.132]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:00:08.132 --> 03:00:11.816]  And again, this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., we're going to be rearing this on the syndicated show we do at Akela BJ.
[03:00:13.806 --> 03:00:22.674]  In the time we've got to close, I just want to pick your brain about this, because I looked it up and found out that police are dialing into Nexus, Lexus databases and these threat databases.
[03:00:22.674 --> 03:00:31.382]  My dad, I sold him one of my cars, and he was driving back from our East Texas ranch a few weeks ago at night at about 10 o'clock.
[03:00:31.382 --> 03:00:34.705]  He gets pulled over and the cops wait back and they come over and they say, you're not Alex Jones.
[03:00:35.746 --> 03:00:48.102]  And this came up as Handle With Care, and I'd heard two legislatures ago, four years ago, that they wanted a database of you'd said things about police, what your view was of police.
[03:00:48.102 --> 03:00:49.884]  The legislature almost passed that.
[03:00:49.884 --> 03:00:51.466]  A, were you aware of stuff like that?
[03:00:51.466 --> 03:00:53.289]  And B, do you know what database I'm in?
[03:00:54.363 --> 03:00:58.026]  I've been a cop for 22 years, I'll be real honest with you.
[03:00:58.026 --> 03:01:03.210]  I have never had a database that, I haven't encountered that database yet.
[03:01:03.210 --> 03:01:05.252]  I mean, does it exist?
[03:01:05.252 --> 03:01:07.434]  To my knowledge, it doesn't.
[03:01:07.434 --> 03:01:13.919]  But the reality is, we here in Austin, our activists are actually pretty peaceful activists.
[03:01:13.919 --> 03:01:19.383]  I don't think that anybody's ever died from words, unless you've incited riots or something, getting people to kill people.
[03:01:19.383 --> 03:01:20.264]  We don't want that!
[03:01:20.524 --> 03:01:24.048]  We definitely don't want that.
[03:01:24.048 --> 03:01:39.506]  I don't know if you know this, but our crowd control team, the Darth Vader outfits, just remember, if it looks tough and at least we can get people to demonstrate, exercise their First Amendment rights without getting violent,
[03:01:40.086 --> 03:01:41.066]  I think we've won.
[03:01:41.066 --> 03:01:45.708]  I mean, their organizational model is protect the first.
[03:01:45.708 --> 03:01:46.448]  And we believe that.
[03:01:46.448 --> 03:01:47.629]  Well, I'll tell you this.
[03:01:47.629 --> 03:01:49.830]  We know you have intelligence units.
[03:01:49.830 --> 03:01:53.611]  About seven, eight years ago, they were having the big meeting.
[03:01:55.277 --> 03:01:58.258]  For the Forbes Fortune 500 here in town at the Four Seasons.
[03:01:58.258 --> 03:02:02.940]  We were down at the Capitol for a protest and there were big cops dressed up like anarchists scurrying up trouble.
[03:02:02.940 --> 03:02:04.961]  Are you going to have any provocateuring here while you're here?
[03:02:04.961 --> 03:02:05.781]  No.
[03:02:05.781 --> 03:02:08.062]  Look, my job is to protect people.
[03:02:08.062 --> 03:02:09.422]  Here's what I just want you to keep an eye on.
[03:02:09.422 --> 03:02:10.763]  So you're changing those things.
[03:02:10.763 --> 03:02:11.723]  Well, listen.
[03:02:11.723 --> 03:02:13.464]  You know you've got provocateurs.
[03:02:13.464 --> 03:02:16.985]  If I catch them, they won't be cops much longer.
[03:02:16.985 --> 03:02:18.126]  The reality is this.
[03:02:18.126 --> 03:02:19.106]  Fidel did stuff like that.
[03:02:19.466 --> 03:02:20.046]  Well, yeah, he did.
[03:02:20.046 --> 03:02:21.887]  I hope the guy's dead.
[03:02:21.887 --> 03:02:22.628]  I'm hoping.
[03:02:22.628 --> 03:02:25.469]  I wake up every morning, that's what, as a Cuban, the first thing is, has he died yet?
[03:02:25.469 --> 03:02:27.130]  They say he's holding on by his toenails.
[03:02:27.130 --> 03:02:30.752]  Oh, I think they have, remember Weekend at Bernie's?
[03:02:30.752 --> 03:02:31.613]  I think that's the character.
[03:02:31.613 --> 03:02:33.174]  I think he's been dead for about a year.
[03:02:33.174 --> 03:02:34.134]  Hopefully he is.
[03:02:34.134 --> 03:02:36.476]  But the reality is, our primary
[03:02:37.356 --> 03:02:45.518]  Focus and mission, when we're trying to find out what's going on with a demonstration, is not to stop the demonstration.
[03:02:45.518 --> 03:02:49.679]  It's not to prohibit you or get in your way from exercising your first amendment rights.
[03:02:49.679 --> 03:02:58.801]  It's to make sure we don't have somebody come in, get in the middle of a bunch of peaceful protesters, and next thing you know they start throwing things at the cops and things get ugly.
[03:02:58.801 --> 03:03:00.762]  Hold on, hold on, we're coming back to the main transmission.
[03:03:00.762 --> 03:03:01.822]  We'll close it out here.
[03:03:01.822 --> 03:03:02.422]  Do you have Baldwin?
[03:03:02.802 --> 03:03:03.444]  He's all set.
[03:03:03.444 --> 03:03:08.015]  Okay, I want you to play a three minute CNN clip about the vaccines killing kids so I can say bye to the Chief.
[03:03:08.015 --> 03:03:08.476]  Here we go.
[03:03:08.476 --> 03:03:08.597]  Okay.
[03:03:09.753 --> 03:03:13.075]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:03:13.075 --> 03:03:17.678]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:03:17.678 --> 03:03:22.341]  Okay, I'm going to say bye to police chief from Austin, Texas, Marty Acevedo.
[03:03:22.341 --> 03:03:27.345]  We were just talking about police and provocateur actions, which have now been confirmed by mainstream news in Canada.
[03:03:27.345 --> 03:03:28.866]  In Seattle, they hired police.
[03:03:28.866 --> 03:03:31.748]  They had feds dressed up like anarchists, attacked police.
[03:03:31.748 --> 03:03:34.289]  The cops didn't know to then stage that event.
[03:03:34.289 --> 03:03:36.731]  He's saying he's not going to have that in Austin.
[03:03:37.051 --> 03:03:39.392]  Just know the Fed boys are masters of that.
[03:03:39.392 --> 03:03:41.933]  And again, we just want to thank you for your honesty and your time.
[03:03:41.933 --> 03:03:47.255]  And I don't want to take any more of your time, so you know the next time you come in I won't twist your arm into, you know, 50 minutes again.
[03:03:47.255 --> 03:03:48.575]  But thank you, sir.
[03:03:48.575 --> 03:03:49.255]  Hey, my pleasure.
[03:03:49.255 --> 03:03:51.216]  And if you need anything, you have any questions, give us a call.
[03:03:51.216 --> 03:03:51.616]  Thank you.
[03:03:51.616 --> 03:03:53.997]  That is the Austin Police Chief leaving us.
[03:03:53.997 --> 03:03:59.099]  And we're going to go ahead and play this CNN piece about the HPV shots killing people that your young girls are taking.
[03:03:59.099 --> 03:04:00.399]  We told you a year ago it was killing you.
[03:04:00.399 --> 03:04:01.619]  Now here it is on CNN.
[03:04:01.619 --> 03:04:02.620]  We know how to read the drug.
[03:04:03.280 --> 03:04:04.281]  I'm not kidding, Chief.
[03:04:04.281 --> 03:04:07.404]  You can listen to it right now, and then we're going to go to the presidential candidate Chuck Baldwin.
[03:04:07.404 --> 03:04:08.085]  Here we go.
[03:04:28.703 --> 03:04:32.644]  Taqueria Williams doesn't get to act like a kid anymore.
[03:04:32.644 --> 03:04:35.284]  She's just too tired.
[03:04:35.284 --> 03:04:43.426]  It kind of hurts because I used to do a lot.
[03:04:43.426 --> 03:04:53.648]  But Taqueria's mother says everything changed last December after her daughter received Gardasil, a vaccine that prevents 70% of cervical cancer.
[03:04:53.648 --> 03:04:54.808]  She's never been sick.
[03:04:54.808 --> 03:04:56.909]  She's never been in a hospital.
[03:04:56.909 --> 03:04:57.309]  Nothing.
[03:04:58.228 --> 03:05:00.729]  Until the Gardasil shot.
[03:05:00.729 --> 03:05:07.970]  Two months after getting the shot, Taqueria says she got a rash on her face and arms, leaving these scars.
[03:05:07.970 --> 03:05:14.372]  She had swelling all over, pain in her joints, and poor circulation in her fingertips.
[03:05:14.372 --> 03:05:27.135]  Her doctor told us she now suffers from an autoimmune disease and says it is possible the Gardasil triggered her illness, though she made it clear the cause cannot be proven.
[03:05:28.052 --> 03:05:38.278]  According to a federal tracking system called VAERS, there have been 9,749 adverse reactions following the vaccination.
[03:05:38.278 --> 03:05:40.840]  And 21 reported deaths since 2006.
[03:05:40.840 --> 03:05:44.642]  I chose to get my daughter vaccinated.
[03:05:44.642 --> 03:05:49.505]  But Merck, Gardasil's maker, points out these are anecdotal cases.
[03:05:49.505 --> 03:05:57.470]  In a statement, company officials say it, quote, does not necessarily mean that the vaccine caused or contributed to the event.
[03:05:58.203 --> 03:06:09.428]  An official with the Centers for Disease Control says VAERS does not provide enough information for researchers to prove whether Gardasil caused any of the reported side effects.
[03:06:09.428 --> 03:06:13.990]  We want to have better data to reassure people.
[03:06:13.990 --> 03:06:25.294]  But again, the patterns and number of serious events looked at in VAERS do not suggest any increase in risk.
[03:06:25.294 --> 03:06:26.615]  While the CDC believes
[03:06:28.968 --> 03:06:43.711]  We are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy to get people actually to love their servitude.
[03:06:43.711 --> 03:06:53.274]  People can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which, by any decent standard, they ought not to enjoy.
[03:06:53.274 --> 03:06:55.074]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[03:06:58.851 --> 03:07:04.417]  Perhaps you had better stop from the beginning.
[03:07:04.417 --> 03:07:09.562]  Perhaps you had better stop from the beginning.
[03:07:09.562 --> 03:07:12.745]  Too many kids are what's making planet worse.
[03:07:12.745 --> 03:07:15.067]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[03:07:15.067 --> 03:07:17.550]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[03:07:19.736 --> 03:07:26.077]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatric.
[03:07:26.077 --> 03:07:32.959]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[03:07:32.959 --> 03:07:38.120]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay, but could it also cause cancer?
[03:07:38.120 --> 03:07:40.900]  Turns out the government had the right, under U.S.
[03:07:40.900 --> 03:07:45.161]  law, to conduct secret testing on the American public under specific conditions.
[03:07:45.161 --> 03:07:48.142]  We have to work with dark side, or we're gonna spend time in the shadows.
[03:07:49.455 --> 03:07:53.497]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil.
[03:07:53.497 --> 03:07:54.557]  Well, join me.
[03:07:54.557 --> 03:07:56.978]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan.
[03:07:56.978 --> 03:07:58.279]  Journal Pediatric.
[03:07:58.279 --> 03:08:05.181]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[03:08:05.181 --> 03:08:10.163]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay, but could it also cause cancer?
[03:08:10.163 --> 03:08:13.124]  Turns out the government had the right under U.S.
[03:08:13.124 --> 03:08:17.246]  law to conduct secret testing on the American public under a specific condition.
[03:08:17.406 --> 03:08:21.690]  I'll have to work with Darkseid while we spend time in the shadows.
[03:08:21.690 --> 03:08:25.713]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil.
[03:08:25.713 --> 03:08:27.015]  Well, join me.
[03:08:27.015 --> 03:08:29.397]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan.
[03:08:29.397 --> 03:08:32.760]  There's a need for a new world order.
[03:08:32.760 --> 03:08:39.185]  Someday, in the next few years, a solution will emerge.
[03:08:56.073 --> 03:09:01.437]  Yeah, the Chief's leaving, listening to us on 90.1 and 1330.
[03:09:01.437 --> 03:09:04.480]  And behind the scenes, he's telling me about all my videos he's watched.
[03:09:04.480 --> 03:09:07.302]  I meant to bring that up to him on air and get him to say all that.
[03:09:07.302 --> 03:09:09.623]  But he left with a handful of my films.
[03:09:09.623 --> 03:09:12.085]  He said, uh-oh, I'm getting brainwashed.
[03:09:12.085 --> 03:09:14.747]  No, I think it was the other way around.
[03:09:14.747 --> 03:09:16.929]  I shook his hand and I said, oh, you're co-opting me.
[03:09:16.929 --> 03:09:20.412]  He was inviting me to go ride around with him and survey things.
[03:09:20.412 --> 03:09:22.373]  And he said, yes, I am.
[03:09:22.373 --> 03:09:24.535]  That guy is going to be going up
[03:09:25.842 --> 03:09:29.503]  I don't think he's a bad guy, but I think he's a pragmatist.
[03:09:29.503 --> 03:09:34.345]  And, uh, better watch that, uh, that R. Day Cervedo.
[03:09:34.345 --> 03:09:37.306]  He, he will definitely, you won't, that's not the last you'll be hearing from him.
[03:09:37.306 --> 03:09:38.547]  That guy's something else.
[03:09:38.547 --> 03:09:40.528]  I run into a lot of politicians.
[03:09:40.528 --> 03:09:42.028]  Yeah, let me tell you, he was something else.
[03:09:42.028 --> 03:09:47.430]  Hey, Burmess, we're about to go to a man who's not a politician, who's a statesman, who I'll be voting for for president.
[03:09:47.430 --> 03:09:48.771]  But Jason, what'd you think of that police chief?
[03:09:49.784 --> 03:09:50.324]  Charming.
[03:09:50.324 --> 03:09:53.967]  You know, he was a really nice guy and very well spoken.
[03:09:53.967 --> 03:09:56.048]  Presented himself well.
[03:09:56.048 --> 03:09:57.509]  Snuck around some questions there.
[03:09:57.509 --> 03:10:00.831]  You know, I don't know anything about that, but you know, let's see if he's genuine.
[03:10:00.831 --> 03:10:03.052]  You know, let's see if he comes back in here after you have the documents.
[03:10:03.052 --> 03:10:04.533]  He's either a good guy or he's really evil.
[03:10:05.593 --> 03:10:07.094]  I don't think he's really evil.
[03:10:07.094 --> 03:10:12.597]  I think that he believes he's doing the greater good, and you know, even his stance on technology, he's right.
[03:10:12.597 --> 03:10:14.738]  I mean, technology inherently is not evil.
[03:10:14.738 --> 03:10:15.178]  It's how we use it.
[03:10:15.178 --> 03:10:18.200]  Look at how we use technology against them, with their corruption.
[03:10:18.200 --> 03:10:18.780]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:10:18.780 --> 03:10:19.840]  It cuts both ways.
[03:10:19.840 --> 03:10:20.621]  Well, hey, thanks Burmese.
[03:10:20.621 --> 03:10:24.142]  I'm going to have you in later about fabled enemies in the next hour at the end of the show.
[03:10:24.142 --> 03:10:27.024]  Okay, I apologize to our illustrious guest.
[03:10:27.644 --> 03:10:29.185]  Uh, but we're here to promote his campaign.
[03:10:29.185 --> 03:10:33.366]  He's been holding for about five minutes, but the police chief got here late and we had to say bye to him.
[03:10:33.366 --> 03:10:39.609]  Uh, and of course he needs an introduction to this audience, but I want to get an update on what the campaign's doing and what he thinks of things happening in the world.
[03:10:39.609 --> 03:10:51.013]  That's Pastor Chuck Baldwin, syndicated columnist and a radio talk show host, a big church down in Pensacola, and he's running, uh, he got the nomination over a neocon, uh, for the, uh,
[03:10:52.481 --> 03:10:56.403]  Party that is the only party of choice out there.
[03:10:56.403 --> 03:10:58.824]  And that is the Constitution Party, Chuck Baldwin.
[03:10:58.824 --> 03:11:00.905]  Pastor, thanks for coming on with us.
[03:11:00.905 --> 03:11:03.926]  Alex, it's good to be with you once again.
[03:11:03.926 --> 03:11:09.428]  Here I am with the awesome police chief telling him that Rolter Quan Chi loves the devil.
[03:11:09.428 --> 03:11:12.049]  I caught bits and pieces of that conversation.
[03:11:12.049 --> 03:11:12.850]  That was phenomenal.
[03:11:12.850 --> 03:11:15.751]  That police chief sounds like a number one guy.
[03:11:15.751 --> 03:11:18.492]  He really is a very charming, very nice fellow.
[03:11:18.492 --> 03:11:19.613]  Showing pictures of his kids.
[03:11:20.825 --> 03:11:22.186]  Yeah, he's not a good guy.
[03:11:22.186 --> 03:11:24.067]  He's one of the few people that can trick me.
[03:11:24.067 --> 03:11:26.448]  But, uh, he certainly came off credible.
[03:11:26.448 --> 03:11:31.330]  Okay, tell us how the campaign's going, where it's going, then give us your take on some of the things that are happening currently, sir.
[03:11:32.549 --> 03:11:35.951]  Well, Alex, the campaign is picking up steam and picking up momentum.
[03:11:35.951 --> 03:11:41.513]  I don't know whether you heard, but we made the front page story in the New York Times today.
[03:11:41.513 --> 03:11:45.956]  They were covering Dr. Corsi's book on Obama.
[03:11:45.956 --> 03:11:52.479]  And, of course, in the book, Dr. Corsi mentioned that he was voting for me and not John McCain.
[03:11:52.479 --> 03:11:55.160]  And so that made the New York Times this morning.
[03:11:55.160 --> 03:11:57.301]  And so we're getting a lot of response to that already.
[03:11:57.301 --> 03:11:58.842]  But the campaign is really going well.
[03:11:59.631 --> 03:12:06.824]  We're getting a lot of phone interviews, we're getting a lot of invitations to speak, and the train just keeps rolling down the track.
[03:12:08.143 --> 03:12:12.547]  Well, and some cynical people that don't understand the process say, well, he's not going to win.
[03:12:12.547 --> 03:12:13.148]  What's the point?
[03:12:13.148 --> 03:12:16.110]  Well, you're going around educating millions of people.
[03:12:16.110 --> 03:12:17.832]  Then you get in the New York Times.
[03:12:17.832 --> 03:12:21.655]  That's what every newspaper, magazine, and talk show and TV producer looks at.
[03:12:21.655 --> 03:12:23.577]  Then that gets you booked other places.
[03:12:23.577 --> 03:12:26.160]  You reach tens of millions, just like Ron Paul did.
[03:12:26.160 --> 03:12:32.946]  Bottom line, you grow the liberty movement and show the people that a time when it's needed more than ever, there's an alternative to the controlled left and right.
[03:12:33.506 --> 03:12:45.772]  That's controlled by the New World Order in Washington, the two parties, and so we need to continue to grow that alternative if we have any hope in the future of when the time comes being able to have a true restoration of our liberties in this country.
[03:12:45.772 --> 03:12:47.834]  That's why people have got to get behind Chuck Baldwin.
[03:12:47.834 --> 03:13:00.340]  Yeah, absolutely, Alex, and I haven't looked at it lately, but World Net Daily was running a survey on their website as to who would you vote for if the election were today, and I was pulling in second place behind McCain.
[03:13:01.167 --> 03:13:02.667]  Uh, and ahead of everybody else.
[03:13:02.667 --> 03:13:08.549]  So, I mean, people are beginning to start looking at us and paying attention to us.
[03:13:08.549 --> 03:13:09.309]  Well, good job.
[03:13:09.309 --> 03:13:13.530]  Ron Paul should have run, and I know you were supporting him in that.
[03:13:13.530 --> 03:13:18.031]  I don't think he realized, but I know his wife's been real sick, the destiny he was missing.
[03:13:18.031 --> 03:13:21.972]  If you're already number two in some polls, imagine what it would have been with Ron Paul.
[03:13:21.972 --> 03:13:23.513]  But again, that's done now.
[03:13:23.513 --> 03:13:24.433]  We've got to get behind you.
[03:13:25.507 --> 03:13:27.028]  Well, right, exactly.
[03:13:27.028 --> 03:13:33.610]  Ron's doing what he feels led to do, and I just have to trust that he's doing the right thing for him.
[03:13:33.610 --> 03:13:35.370]  And we do need to pray for his wife, Carol.
[03:13:35.370 --> 03:13:40.112]  She's in the hospital doing very poorly, and we do certainly need to pray for her.
[03:13:40.112 --> 03:13:43.173]  And I know that people out there all across the country are doing that.
[03:13:43.173 --> 03:13:49.055]  But, you know, we chose to go ahead and allow our name to be put in the nomination and the party involved.
[03:13:49.575 --> 03:13:52.717]  Selected me over Alan Keyes, and so here I am.
[03:13:52.717 --> 03:14:02.224]  I've been going up and down the country from east to west, north to south, and we've been getting the same message everywhere we go, that people do not trust John McCain.
[03:14:02.224 --> 03:14:04.186]  They do not trust Barack Obama.
[03:14:04.186 --> 03:14:06.627]  They're looking for an alternative.
[03:14:06.627 --> 03:14:09.369]  They want somebody who's going to represent the Constitution.
[03:14:09.369 --> 03:14:13.452]  Somebody who's going to preserve and protect our borders, our sovereignty, our independence.
[03:14:13.452 --> 03:14:15.974]  Somebody who's going to speak against the New World Order.
[03:14:16.615 --> 03:14:20.248]  And really, I'm the only one in 2008 that's going to do that.
[03:14:22.034 --> 03:14:22.675]  Absolutely.
[03:14:22.675 --> 03:14:31.201]  We're going to break, but I want to come back and take phone calls, Chuck Baldwin, or also get your take on the Russia situation, the Iran situation, policies.
[03:14:31.201 --> 03:14:41.328]  While you're 180 degrees from Barack Obama and John McCain, a true constitutionalist, a true conservative, a true Christian American with the Constitution Party, give out the website and campaign info, 1-800-259-9231.
[03:14:41.328 --> 03:14:42.950]  1-800-259-9231 to get involved on air with us.
[03:14:49.374 --> 03:14:54.557]  And Chuck Baldwin right now, presidential candidate, on the Constitution Party ticket.
[03:14:54.557 --> 03:14:57.658]  But before we get a break in 30 seconds, fire out the website and phone number.
[03:14:57.658 --> 03:14:58.339]  Right.
[03:14:58.339 --> 03:15:00.860]  The website is Baldwin08.com.
[03:15:00.860 --> 03:15:02.521]  That's Baldwin08.com.
[03:15:02.521 --> 03:15:04.302]  And the phone number is toll-free, 866-99-BALDWIN.
[03:15:04.302 --> 03:15:05.482]  That's 866-99-BALDWIN.
[03:15:05.482 --> 03:15:07.083]  And give that website out again.
[03:15:11.594 --> 03:15:13.117]  www.bald108.com.
[03:15:13.117 --> 03:15:15.602]  www.bald108.com.
[03:15:15.602 --> 03:15:18.006]  And we've got links to that up on InfoWars.com.
[03:15:18.006 --> 03:15:20.872]  We'll be right back with Pastor Chuck Baldwin, running for president.
[03:15:20.872 --> 03:15:21.473]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:28.917 --> 03:15:33.039]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[03:15:33.039 --> 03:15:45.745]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[03:15:45.745 --> 03:15:46.185]  The U.S.
[03:15:46.185 --> 03:15:51.728]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[03:15:52.168 --> 03:15:55.149]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[03:15:55.149 --> 03:15:57.349]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[03:15:57.349 --> 03:16:00.290]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[03:16:00.290 --> 03:16:06.752]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[03:16:06.752 --> 03:16:10.192]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[03:16:10.192 --> 03:16:16.514]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[03:16:17.074 --> 03:16:21.216]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[03:16:21.216 --> 03:16:24.177]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[03:16:24.177 --> 03:16:24.597]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[03:16:24.597 --> 03:16:30.399]  It is a big idea.
[03:16:30.399 --> 03:16:33.200]  A new world order.
[03:16:33.200 --> 03:16:38.082]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:16:38.082 --> 03:16:40.923]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:16:40.923 --> 03:16:43.704]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:16:43.704 --> 03:16:46.105]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:16:46.881 --> 03:16:57.250]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:16:57.250 --> 03:17:02.695]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:17:02.695 --> 03:17:06.579]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:17:06.579 --> 03:17:08.080]  Bill Burgess is making great progress.
[03:17:24.987 --> 03:17:29.633]  ...today, and you can start saving hundreds of dollars in fees and interest payments.
[03:17:29.633 --> 03:17:34.880]  CARE One agencies have helped over 4 million people get out of debt, and they can help you, too.
[03:17:34.880 --> 03:17:35.221]  Call 800-498-20...
[03:17:39.138 --> 03:17:39.238]  2981-800-498-2981.
[03:17:39.238 --> 03:17:42.262]  And find out how you can lower your monthly payments up to 57%.
[03:17:42.262 --> 03:17:44.244]  One 15-minute phone call can change your life.
[03:17:44.244 --> 03:17:44.504]  Call 800-498-2981.
[03:17:44.504 --> 03:17:44.564]  800-498-2981.
[03:17:44.564 --> 03:17:45.686]  Provider and licensing details are available.
[03:17:58.760 --> 03:18:01.661]  Listener, ask yourself, can I be deceived?
[03:18:01.661 --> 03:18:03.742]  Matthew 24 states four times.
[03:18:03.742 --> 03:18:06.064]  In the last days, many will be deceived.
[03:18:06.064 --> 03:18:09.625]  There are many ideas about the mark of the beast and the antichrist.
[03:18:09.625 --> 03:18:13.527]  What do you know about the beast, its mark, and the antichrist?
[03:18:13.527 --> 03:18:17.449]  Is the beast a superpower nation or a giant computer in Belgium?
[03:18:17.449 --> 03:18:19.530]  Is its mark an implanted chip, a tattoo,
[03:18:19.970 --> 03:18:25.693]  The National ID Card, or 666, is the Antichrist a person, title, or both?
[03:18:25.693 --> 03:18:27.634]  Some believe these things are in the future.
[03:18:27.634 --> 03:18:29.615]  Others believe that it's in the past.
[03:18:29.615 --> 03:18:32.896]  1 John states, The Antichrist is already in the world.
[03:18:32.896 --> 03:18:35.058]  What is the truth, and what is a lie?
[03:18:35.058 --> 03:18:37.399]  Are you willing to search God's Word for the truth?
[03:18:37.399 --> 03:18:39.400]  Friends, these answers are in the Bible.
[03:18:39.400 --> 03:18:46.063]  For free books, DVDs, and Bible studies exposing the Antichrist, the Beast, and its mark, write to The Bible Says.
[03:18:46.403 --> 03:18:47.866]  Box 99, Lenore City, Tennessee, 37771.
[03:18:47.866 --> 03:18:48.327]  Or call 888-211-1715.
[03:18:48.327 --> 03:18:48.667]  That's 888-211-1715.
[03:19:07.925 --> 03:19:10.668]  You can't run on.
[03:19:10.668 --> 03:19:14.353]  You can't run on for a long time.
[03:19:14.353 --> 03:19:17.276]  Run on for a long time.
[03:19:17.276 --> 03:19:20.120]  Run on for a long time.
[03:19:20.120 --> 03:19:23.083]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[03:19:23.083 --> 03:19:25.606]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[03:19:27.718 --> 03:19:30.481]  Pastor Chuck Baldwin is our guest.
[03:19:30.481 --> 03:19:32.383]  Your call is in the next segment.
[03:19:47.632 --> 03:19:55.876]  In the last ten minutes or so, I'm going to have Jason Berners in the studio about his new film, Fabled Enemies, and some of the more controversial sections of the film.
[03:19:55.876 --> 03:20:04.900]  Pastor, looking at internationally what's happening, the United States, through Georgia, launches a sneak attack on Russian forces.
[03:20:04.900 --> 03:20:07.021]  I'm no fan of the Russians or Putin, what they're doing.
[03:20:07.021 --> 03:20:08.281]  Don't trust them either.
[03:20:08.281 --> 03:20:09.382]  But this is unprecedented.
[03:20:09.382 --> 03:20:13.504]  Now they've got five carrier groups going into the Gulf, talking about hitting Iran.
[03:20:13.504 --> 03:20:16.325]  Internationally, what does the Constitution say we should be doing?
[03:20:17.296 --> 03:20:22.062]  Well, and the Constitution says nothing about any of that.
[03:20:22.062 --> 03:20:36.278]  What we've got going on is we have neglected the wise counsel of our founding fathers that said we ought to have free and fair trade with all nations as much as possible, but entangling alliances with none.
[03:20:36.898 --> 03:20:43.121]  And what we've done instead is we have engaged in entangling alliances all over the globe.
[03:20:43.121 --> 03:20:47.022]  And basically we've done this at the behest of the United Nations.
[03:20:47.022 --> 03:20:56.066]  The United States has, for the most part, allowed its troops overseas to be the international cops for the United Nations.
[03:20:56.066 --> 03:21:00.508]  And so we really have no foreign policy independent of the UN.
[03:21:01.169 --> 03:21:06.178]  And as President of the United States, what I would do is work to get out of the United Nations altogether.
[03:21:06.178 --> 03:21:07.841]  I think we need to get out of NATO.
[03:21:07.841 --> 03:21:10.226]  We have no business being over there.
[03:21:10.226 --> 03:21:11.548]  It's an organization that...
[03:21:12.333 --> 03:21:14.755]  It doesn't even need to exist at this point.
[03:21:14.755 --> 03:21:35.291]  All we're doing is antagonizing other countries over there constantly, and then we wonder why they react sometimes the way they do, when the truth of the matter is that our policies, and that's the United Nations policies for the most part, have created the conflicts that often arise in various parts of the world.
[03:21:35.291 --> 03:21:41.176]  And we just need to get out of those situations altogether, start putting America first, and American interests first,
[03:21:41.776 --> 03:21:44.177]  Now, everything you've said is not just constitutional.
[03:22:11.923 --> 03:22:19.067]  It is also popular, but we see both of the other main parties completely ignoring the will of the people.
[03:22:19.067 --> 03:22:25.590]  Well, they ignore the will of the people, and they ignore the Constitution that they are sworn to uphold.
[03:22:25.590 --> 03:22:31.713]  Every constitutionally elected officeholder, whether it's President, Senator, Congress, County Commissioner, it doesn't matter.
[03:22:31.713 --> 03:22:35.355]  They put one hand on the Bible, they put another hand to heaven, and they affirm an oath.
[03:22:36.075 --> 03:22:39.898]  To preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.
[03:22:39.898 --> 03:22:40.719]  Period.
[03:22:40.719 --> 03:22:42.520]  That's what they are sworn to do.
[03:22:42.520 --> 03:22:44.502]  But they haven't done that in a long time.
[03:22:44.502 --> 03:22:46.704]  They have no intention of doing it.
[03:22:46.704 --> 03:22:51.628]  But upholding the Constitution and my oath to it is something that I take very seriously.
[03:22:51.628 --> 03:22:54.310]  It's something that Ron Paul takes seriously.
[03:22:54.310 --> 03:22:57.013]  And I, like him, would be faithful to that oath.
[03:22:57.013 --> 03:23:03.358]  And I can tell you that as President of the United States, I would expect the other members of the federal government to do likewise.
[03:23:04.645 --> 03:23:10.469]  Well, for those that don't know history, or what an oath's really about, I mean, it is a commitment.
[03:23:10.469 --> 03:23:14.952]  It is, I swear that I will faithfully execute this.
[03:23:14.952 --> 03:23:20.295]  That's like if you swear an oath to protect your family, or your community, or you swear an oath not to cheat or steal.
[03:23:20.295 --> 03:23:21.476]  I mean, it's who you are.
[03:23:21.476 --> 03:23:25.359]  It's what you've... Oaths have been sworn, and oaths will be kept.
[03:23:25.359 --> 03:23:26.299]  I mean, this is ancient.
[03:23:26.299 --> 03:23:27.060]  This is important.
[03:23:27.060 --> 03:23:28.281]  This is who you are.
[03:23:28.281 --> 03:23:33.284]  And if you won't keep oaths, others aren't going to keep their oaths, and the society descends into hell on earth.
[03:23:34.020 --> 03:23:37.416]  And the fact that most of these politicians won't keep their oaths makes them traitors.
[03:23:39.302 --> 03:23:51.450]  You're certainly right, and I do believe that the real issue confronting America today is not what Russia is doing in Georgia, it's not Iran and these other places.
[03:23:51.450 --> 03:23:58.494]  What's the great danger, the great risk to America today is what's happening in our own country.
[03:23:58.494 --> 03:24:04.038]  The sacrifice of our borders, the sacrifice of our independence, our national autonomy.
[03:24:04.038 --> 03:24:06.500]  We see NAFTA being merged into
[03:24:07.301 --> 03:24:12.766]  Internationalist institutions that are going to literally dwarf the independence of the United States.
[03:24:12.766 --> 03:24:16.170]  You've got the NAFTA superhighway trying to come through Texas there.
[03:24:16.170 --> 03:24:20.695]  You've got the creation of the North American community, North American Union.
[03:24:20.695 --> 03:24:26.821]  You've got the tripartite agreement between Canada, the United States, and Mexico to sell out of our sovereignty.
[03:24:26.821 --> 03:24:28.423]  Our borders are being erased.
[03:24:29.103 --> 03:24:34.585]  That we are literally on the verge of losing our very independence and our national sovereignty.
[03:24:34.585 --> 03:24:36.586]  The United States is... Sorry.
[03:24:36.586 --> 03:24:38.847]  The United States is collapsing into the New World Order.
[03:24:38.847 --> 03:24:40.187]  Pastor, finish up when we get back.
[03:24:40.187 --> 03:24:43.729]  We're so honored to have a presidential candidate from the Constitution Party.
[03:24:43.729 --> 03:24:45.109]  Chuck Baldwin on with us.
[03:24:45.109 --> 03:24:46.450]  Your calls are straight ahead.
[03:24:46.450 --> 03:24:49.871]  Stay with us.
[03:24:49.871 --> 03:24:51.252]  We're on the march.
[03:24:51.252 --> 03:24:53.793]  The empire's on the run.
[03:24:53.793 --> 03:24:56.494]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:24:59.867 --> 03:25:00.628]  Hi there.
[03:25:00.628 --> 03:25:02.849]  I want to talk to you about a dirty word.
[03:25:02.849 --> 03:25:03.910]  Hangover.
[03:25:03.910 --> 03:25:05.031]  I know, I know.
[03:25:05.031 --> 03:25:08.573]  As the makers of drink and mate hangover defense tablets, we hear it every day.
[03:25:08.573 --> 03:25:11.435]  Grown, respectable adults don't get hangovers.
[03:25:13.550 --> 03:25:21.435]  Hangovers are what you got in college when you had about ten too many at the frat house and then rolled out of bed bright and early at the crack of noon the next day.
[03:25:21.435 --> 03:25:22.355]  These days?
[03:25:22.355 --> 03:25:28.779]  Well sure, sometimes you'll have a couple drinks with dinner and sometimes you'll wake up with a little headache feeling just a bit queasy.
[03:25:28.779 --> 03:25:31.100]  But that's not really a hangover, is it?
[03:25:31.100 --> 03:25:32.841]  Well, call it what you want, but now you
[03:25:32.841 --> 03:25:33.261]  You don't need
[03:25:56.045 --> 03:25:59.266]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[03:25:59.266 --> 03:26:05.968]  I've come with a message of information.
[03:26:05.968 --> 03:26:08.209]  9-11 was an inside job.
[03:26:08.209 --> 03:26:09.769]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[03:26:09.769 --> 03:26:11.470]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[03:26:11.470 --> 03:26:14.371]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[03:26:14.371 --> 03:26:17.972]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[03:26:27.667 --> 03:26:32.483]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[03:26:36.329 --> 03:26:40.391]  How dare you?
[03:26:40.391 --> 03:26:43.992]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[03:26:43.992 --> 03:26:46.733]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[03:26:46.733 --> 03:26:53.215]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[03:26:58.297 --> 03:27:00.778]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[03:27:03.135 --> 03:27:08.783]  Are you tired of hearing that a cure for cancer is coming, but it will be available sometime in the future?
[03:27:08.783 --> 03:27:11.426]  At LaysMedInc, the future is here.
[03:27:11.426 --> 03:27:17.995]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with our patented methodology, without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation.
[03:27:18.215 --> 03:27:18.616]  I'm good.
[03:27:34.079 --> 03:27:37.542]  A simple, easy way to eliminate the threat of cancer.
[03:27:37.542 --> 03:27:39.804]  LASER technology at its best.

[03:27:46.690 --> 03:27:48.592]  That's L-A-S-E-M-E-D-I-N-C dot com today.
[03:28:15.749 --> 03:28:18.171]  Pastor Baldwin, the break cut you off there.
[03:28:18.171 --> 03:28:22.433]  Please continue making the point you were covering.
[03:28:22.433 --> 03:28:31.659]  Yeah, well, I was just trying to say, Alex, that everybody focuses on what's going on overseas, and we hear about Iran, and now we're hearing about Russia and Georgia.
[03:28:31.659 --> 03:28:37.803]  And what I was trying to make the point is that the real issue confronting our country today, the most serious threat to America,
[03:28:38.463 --> 03:28:48.073]  It's what's happening right here at home, and the erasure of our borders, the creation of this North American community, the surrender of our national autonomy and our independence.
[03:28:48.073 --> 03:28:56.062]  We are literally on the verge, and I mean we are on the verge of losing our national independence and our national sovereignty.
[03:28:56.522 --> 03:29:02.026]  This is the most important issue confronting the United States of America in 2008.
[03:29:02.026 --> 03:29:11.713]  And quite frankly, no matter whether it's Barack Obama or John McCain, if either one of these fellows gets elected, they will do nothing to prevent this.
[03:29:11.713 --> 03:29:15.175]  They will go along with this New World Order.
[03:29:15.175 --> 03:29:19.438]  They will do nothing to protect America's independence and sovereignty.
[03:29:19.438 --> 03:29:23.261]  We will continue to be pawns for the United Nations and this global economy.
[03:29:23.861 --> 03:29:32.246]  And we will lose our sovereignty as a country, and I really believe this is the number one issue confronting America today.
[03:29:32.246 --> 03:29:47.894]  And for those that are just joining us for the first time, presidential candidate Chuck Baldwin, I want them to understand that we're not exaggerating, we're not embellishing the most dangerous form of political takeovers, not military, as many philosophers and our founders said.
[03:29:48.795 --> 03:29:50.056]  It is from within.
[03:29:50.056 --> 03:30:01.006]  And international corporate structures, as the New World Order are, of the top 100 biggest economies, 50-plus of them now, it was 40-plus, now it's 50-plus, are not governments, they are corporations.
[03:30:01.006 --> 03:30:03.528]  They have intelligence agencies, private mercenaries.
[03:30:03.528 --> 03:30:07.051]  They've bought off county, state, local, federal, international governments.
[03:30:07.051 --> 03:30:08.773]  They have created international governments.
[03:30:09.413 --> 03:30:11.694]  The big Rockefeller Foundations and others.
[03:30:11.694 --> 03:30:12.534]  And the U.S.
[03:30:12.534 --> 03:30:14.595]  is ceasing to exist.
[03:30:14.595 --> 03:30:19.677]  The Bill of Rights, the Constitution, the sovereignty, the international agreements.
[03:30:19.677 --> 03:30:22.137]  It's all happening right now.
[03:30:22.137 --> 03:30:23.898]  We are at the flashpoint.
[03:30:23.898 --> 03:30:25.979]  We are at the key zone here.
[03:30:25.979 --> 03:30:28.660]  And yes, the people are awake to it more than ever and don't like it.
[03:30:28.660 --> 03:30:31.401]  But the establishment just says, we don't care what you're doing.
[03:30:31.401 --> 03:30:32.221]  We're going to move forward.
[03:30:32.621 --> 03:30:34.662]  And so we've got to try to get good people elected locally.
[03:30:34.662 --> 03:30:36.284]  We've got to educate people locally.
[03:30:36.284 --> 03:30:37.344]  We've got to file lawsuits.
[03:30:37.344 --> 03:30:38.165]  We've got to protest.
[03:30:38.165 --> 03:30:39.346]  We've got to refuse.
[03:30:39.346 --> 03:30:40.987]  We've got to say no, no, no, no, no.
[03:30:40.987 --> 03:30:44.709]  We've also got to support national figures like Chuck Baldwin.
[03:30:44.709 --> 03:30:47.151]  And I don't want to hear, you know, well, he doesn't have a chance to win.
[03:30:47.151 --> 03:30:48.091]  Hey, duty is ours.
[03:30:48.091 --> 03:30:49.132]  Consequence belongs to God.
[03:30:49.694 --> 03:30:50.774]  We know they're right.
[03:30:50.774 --> 03:30:52.095]  Resistance is victory.
[03:30:52.095 --> 03:30:52.915]  Go ahead.
[03:30:52.915 --> 03:30:54.256]  Exactly right, Alex.
[03:30:54.256 --> 03:30:55.176]  You're exactly right.
[03:30:55.176 --> 03:30:55.936]  I didn't mean to interrupt.
[03:30:55.936 --> 03:31:04.699]  It's just that, you know, I think it's time that we decide that we're going to do what's right and just let the, you know, consequences be what they may.
[03:31:04.699 --> 03:31:11.261]  But the fact of the matter is, when Chuck Ballard becomes President of the United States, the New World Order comes crashing down.
[03:31:11.801 --> 03:31:13.382]  That is a reality.
[03:31:13.382 --> 03:31:25.507]  If people are literally concerned about our borders and our national security, if they're concerned about the loss of our autonomy, John McCain's out there talking about and promoting the International Criminal Court of all things.
[03:31:25.507 --> 03:31:33.510]  Well, I was about to say, to interrupt, that you're talking about they'll do nothing to stop the New World Order, McCain and Obama, they're jumping jack cheerleaders.
[03:31:33.510 --> 03:31:35.091]  Absolutely right.
[03:31:35.091 --> 03:31:35.551]  And again,
[03:31:36.231 --> 03:31:42.033]  I'm the only candidate for president in 2008 that's willing to address these issues.
[03:31:42.033 --> 03:31:45.655]  I'm the only one that's calling the attention of the American people to what's going on.
[03:31:45.655 --> 03:31:50.396]  I'm the only one who's saying that I want to get America out of the United Nations.
[03:31:50.396 --> 03:31:53.557]  I'm the only one who's saying I want to overturn the Internal Revenue Service.
[03:31:53.557 --> 03:31:55.138]  I want to get rid of the 16th Amendment.
[03:31:55.998 --> 03:32:00.901]  I want to bring America back to its roots, back to the principles of the Constitution.
[03:32:00.901 --> 03:32:02.882]  I want to get rid of the Patriot Act.
[03:32:02.882 --> 03:32:04.303]  I opposed it from the beginning.
[03:32:04.303 --> 03:32:05.664]  I oppose it today.
[03:32:05.664 --> 03:32:07.865]  It doesn't need to be revised or reformed.
[03:32:07.865 --> 03:32:09.646]  It needs to be eliminated.
[03:32:09.646 --> 03:32:09.966]  I agree.
[03:32:09.966 --> 03:32:12.067]  We only have seven minutes for calls.
[03:32:12.067 --> 03:32:13.728]  I'm going to give each caller five of them.
[03:32:13.728 --> 03:32:15.930]  Elliot, Scott, Sherry, Carol, and Fred.
[03:32:15.930 --> 03:32:16.590]  That's going to be it.
[03:32:16.590 --> 03:32:20.552]  Each person gets about a minute and a quick response from Chuck Baldwin.
[03:32:20.552 --> 03:32:21.853]  Elliot in Ohio, you're on the air.
[03:32:23.294 --> 03:32:38.537]  Yeah, uh, Mr. Braun, would you quickly, as soon as you, if you do become president, uh, totally repeal all of Bush's acts, like the Military Commission's Act 2006, PDD 51, uh, both the Patriot Act, John Warner Commission's Act, or just... John Warner Defense Act.
[03:32:38.537 --> 03:32:39.817]  Also, will you repeal U.S.
[03:32:39.817 --> 03:32:51.600]  Code Title 28, Section 3002, definitions that state, following on number 15, the United States means a federal corporation, thereby forth-ending the Anglo-American corporation that is this country, sir.
[03:32:54.136 --> 03:33:05.224]  One of the first things that I will do is to review all of the executive orders that have been executed by President Bush, President Clinton, and President Bush Sr.
[03:33:05.224 --> 03:33:15.071]  And I would review them one by one, and every one of them that was contrary to the principles of the Constitution, I would immediately reverse.
[03:33:15.071 --> 03:33:16.532]  Okay, thank you, Elliot.
[03:33:16.532 --> 03:33:17.153]  Gotta jump.
[03:33:17.153 --> 03:33:18.614]  Scott in Arizona, you're on the air.
[03:33:20.695 --> 03:33:41.554]  Yeah, Chuck, it would be nice to get some celebrities behind you, like Willie Nelson, people who have spoken out for the Patriot Movement and getting back to the Constitution, people like Willie Nelson, the guys, the actors that are on Alex's show all the time, I can't remember their name right now.
[03:33:41.554 --> 03:33:46.939]  No, the point is these aren't our slaves, we just can't make them go out and do that, and who knows if Chuck even wants their endorsement, but go ahead.
[03:33:47.637 --> 03:33:54.999]  I know, but what I'm trying to say is that it would be nice to get some celebrities getting him into the media spotlight and putting some name recognition behind him, too, as well.
[03:33:54.999 --> 03:33:58.159]  Well, we're trying to do that, and he's getting attention.
[03:33:58.159 --> 03:34:00.840]  And again, just the exercise of resistance is victory.
[03:34:00.840 --> 03:34:01.660]  Thank you.
[03:34:01.660 --> 03:34:05.461]  Scott, Sherry in Texas, you're on the air.
[03:34:05.461 --> 03:34:07.021]  Hey, Alex.
[03:34:07.021 --> 03:34:08.522]  Hi, Sherry.
[03:34:08.522 --> 03:34:10.902]  Hey, Pastor.
[03:34:10.902 --> 03:34:14.723]  Hey, I'm from Tyler in northeast Texas.
[03:34:15.436 --> 03:34:24.725]  And, um, I just want to let you know that I'm really, really glad that we don't have to vote for either a neocon or a fascist, you know, this November.
[03:34:24.725 --> 03:34:27.988]  So, you know, yay!
[03:34:27.988 --> 03:34:38.939]  But, um, I was wondering what, if anything, are you planning on doing about the biodefense, that whole system they've set up?
[03:34:38.939 --> 03:34:39.780]  Would you move them?
[03:34:40.672 --> 03:34:43.054]  Back out to the islands that they used to be on?
[03:34:43.054 --> 03:34:47.658]  Yeah, she's talking about the 36 bioweapons labs they've built under Bioshield.
[03:34:47.658 --> 03:34:51.641]  Yeah, the massive development of race-specific bioweapons and things.
[03:34:51.641 --> 03:34:52.422]  What would you do about that?
[03:34:53.422 --> 03:34:56.044]  Okay, you're going to have to bring me up to speed on that, Alex.
[03:34:56.044 --> 03:35:01.189]  Well, you know, they've radically increased the bioweapons program of the U.S.
[03:35:01.189 --> 03:35:16.261]  to a new global arms race, and they're building, or have built, an open, very dangerous Level 4 bioweapons labs in major cities, which contraveils all common sense and former policy.
[03:35:16.261 --> 03:35:19.504]  Well, that kind of thing, there's no call for any of that.
[03:35:20.912 --> 03:35:29.299]  This only portends, I think, bad things for the United States, and I know what the stated interests are of those endeavors.
[03:35:29.299 --> 03:35:36.506]  It has significance for defensive purposes and all that kind of thing, but I think instead what we're dealing with
[03:35:36.986 --> 03:35:41.387]  Well, we've already had whoever it was sneak anthrax out of Fort Dedrick and mail it to Congress.
[03:35:54.211 --> 03:35:54.711]  That's crazy.
[03:35:54.711 --> 03:35:55.652]  Absolutely crazy.
[03:36:09.967 --> 03:36:11.208]  Absolutely.
[03:36:11.208 --> 03:36:15.891]  I can't, you know, there's so many things like this that we hear about, I can't even keep up with them all.
[03:36:15.891 --> 03:36:21.494]  And the problem with it is, Alex, as you know, you alert people all the time when you show all these kind of things.
[03:36:21.494 --> 03:36:26.357]  The ultimate objective of so many of this stuff is internal.
[03:36:27.618 --> 03:36:39.922]  And I think the American people need to recognize here that they sometimes are the ones that are in the crosshairs, and they are the ones that need to be concerned about what the government is doing in these regards.
[03:36:39.922 --> 03:36:40.182]  That's right.
[03:36:40.182 --> 03:36:45.544]  Any weapon they build for somebody else can be wheeled around against us, and they have before.
[03:36:45.544 --> 03:36:53.286]  And or this stuff can accidentally get out, all these weaponized, already deadly diseases that have been made ultra
[03:36:54.395 --> 03:36:56.376]  Many more times more powerful.
[03:36:56.376 --> 03:37:02.760]  And you have the Ministry of Defense in England and the Dick Cheney-Peanak documents saying they want to use these and kill certain races of people.
[03:37:02.760 --> 03:37:06.603]  I mean, that's big news, folks, but the average public isn't aware of it.
[03:37:06.603 --> 03:37:11.006]  I had Police Chief Al Cervedo asking me, he goes, I like your show, I know a lot of it's true, but do you really believe all this?
[03:37:11.006 --> 03:37:13.607]  I'm like, hey man, I don't believe it, it's a fact.
[03:37:13.607 --> 03:37:15.449]  Let's go ahead and talk to Carol in Ohio.
[03:37:15.449 --> 03:37:15.949]  You're on the air.
[03:37:16.696 --> 03:37:19.880]  Oh Alex, I just think you have done so wonderful.
[03:37:19.880 --> 03:37:26.227]  Your show was so great today, especially the interview with that law enforcement.
[03:37:26.227 --> 03:37:32.034]  Chuck, you are so well spoken and you've hit the target right on the head.
[03:37:32.034 --> 03:37:35.218]  It's our sovereignty and our growing police state here at home that we
[03:37:35.738 --> 03:37:37.040]  Should be concerned about it.
[03:37:37.040 --> 03:37:39.322]  Well, Carol, have you read all of his great articles?
[03:37:39.322 --> 03:37:40.723]  He writes, he's very knowledgeable.
[03:37:40.723 --> 03:37:51.815]  Yes, I read him all the time, and I also get him via my email, but I think we should get behind you as much as we were Ron Paul.
[03:37:51.815 --> 03:37:53.216]  You're very well spoken.
[03:37:53.216 --> 03:37:54.237]  You address the issues.
[03:37:54.237 --> 03:37:55.559]  You're not afraid to tackle them.
[03:37:55.999 --> 03:38:07.406]  And I think we should get this Chuck Reagan rolling down the highway to Washington and get in all you people that were behind Ron Paul.
[03:38:07.406 --> 03:38:15.731]  We've got a man here that we should be giving all our strength and energy to in support, just like we did Ron Paul.
[03:38:15.731 --> 03:38:16.752]  So let's get going.
[03:38:16.932 --> 03:38:17.773]  Absolutely, Carol.
[03:38:17.773 --> 03:38:18.153]  Thank you.
[03:38:18.153 --> 03:38:23.838]  We don't have time to get to Fred and others, because we've got to let Pastor Chuck Baldwin go, and I've got some other news to cover.
[03:38:23.838 --> 03:38:25.840]  But he'll be checking back in with us on the campaign.
[03:38:25.840 --> 03:38:27.001]  We're here supporting him.
[03:38:27.001 --> 03:38:29.363]  Pastor, a one-minute closing comment.
[03:38:29.363 --> 03:38:38.352]  Yeah, well, let me just remind everybody in your audience that this Sunday, we've got several of our friends and supporters that are going to be hosting a money bomb for us.
[03:38:39.032 --> 03:38:52.660]  And if anybody would like to help our campaign, if there's people out there that say, what can I do to help Chuck and his campaign, this Sunday, August 17th, if you'll go to, uh, the address is NoNewWorldOrder.com.
[03:38:52.660 --> 03:38:57.263]  And again, that's www.NoNewWorldOrder.com.
[03:38:57.483 --> 03:39:01.226]  And that's being put on by the same guy that started the Ron Paul money bomb and our money bomb.
[03:39:01.226 --> 03:39:01.767]  That's right.
[03:39:01.767 --> 03:39:02.988]  And so it's so exciting.
[03:39:02.988 --> 03:39:03.488]  Great folks.
[03:39:03.488 --> 03:39:04.269]  He's been calling me.
[03:39:04.269 --> 03:39:05.710]  I mean to call him.
[03:39:05.710 --> 03:39:07.091]  I'm just working 18 hours a day.
[03:39:07.091 --> 03:39:11.295]  But yes, that's coming up this Sunday at NoNewWorldOrder.com.
[03:39:11.295 --> 03:39:12.996]  NoMoreNewWorldOrder.com.
[03:39:12.996 --> 03:39:15.338]  And Pastor Bob, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[03:39:15.338 --> 03:39:16.199]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[03:39:16.639 --> 03:39:16.979]  You bet.
[03:39:16.979 --> 03:39:17.780]  There he goes.
[03:39:17.780 --> 03:39:19.781]  We'll plug that again before the week is out.
[03:39:19.781 --> 03:39:24.363]  Remind me to get that Money Bomb guy on, because I want to support what he's doing there as well and support Chuck Baldwin.
[03:39:24.363 --> 03:39:26.184]  And I don't want to hear folks that he can't win.
[03:39:26.184 --> 03:39:30.346]  He probably doesn't have any chance, but the point is he has a chance to wake up millions more.
[03:39:30.346 --> 03:39:34.348]  He has a chance to show up the other two parties and show there's no real choice there.
[03:39:34.348 --> 03:39:45.713]  Okay, I want to shift gears now for the balance of the show, and I want to come in and play one more time today the audio from the trailer of the second trailer that's up on InfoWars.com and the news in focus, the featured story
[03:39:48.313 --> 03:39:56.238]  It is titled, Fabled Enemies, The Israeli Operatives, Trailer 2.
[03:39:56.238 --> 03:39:58.260]  Fabled Enemies, Israeli Operatives, Trailer 2.
[03:39:58.260 --> 03:40:02.042]  Now this is about, I'd say 30% of the film.
[03:40:02.042 --> 03:40:03.363]  It's right at two hours.
[03:40:03.363 --> 03:40:07.966]  But the point is, is that it just gives you the full picture, really shows you the facts that we know.
[03:40:07.966 --> 03:40:09.407]  It's very incriminating.
[03:40:09.407 --> 03:40:13.350]  Here is the audio of the trailer, the second trailer, now up at Infowars.com.
[03:40:14.156 --> 03:40:22.584]  Fox News has learned that some American terrorism investigators fear certain suspects in the September 11th attacks may have managed to stay ahead of them.
[03:40:23.642 --> 03:40:24.143]  Some U.S.
[03:40:24.143 --> 03:40:30.227]  investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:40:30.227 --> 03:40:37.372]  Whether it's because they're in intelligence services or what they were doing, I will defer to the Department of Justice and the FBI.
[03:40:37.372 --> 03:40:43.817]  There was a report on the George Washington Bridge that there had been a van stopped there that had explosives.
[03:40:43.817 --> 03:40:47.440]  We have a suspect who grew in the van and then exploded.
[03:40:49.802 --> 03:40:54.804]  Amdocs Limited, an Israeli-based private telecommunications company.
[03:40:54.804 --> 03:41:01.106]  It is virtually impossible to make a call on normal phones without generating an Amdocs record of it.
[03:41:01.106 --> 03:41:06.589]  It quickly unraveled to be the largest foreign spy ring ever uncovered inside the United States.
[03:41:06.589 --> 03:41:07.709]  The largest.
[03:41:07.709 --> 03:41:15.732]  Documents say they, quote, targeted and penetrated military bases, the DEA, FBI, and dozens of other government facilities.
[03:41:15.732 --> 03:41:18.173]  There's one big elephant in the living room.
[03:41:19.551 --> 03:41:24.739]  It is the relationship between the United States of America and the State of Israel.
[03:41:24.739 --> 03:41:28.505]  What about this question of advanced knowledge of what was going to happen on 9-11?
[03:41:28.505 --> 03:41:31.089]  Well, it's very explosive information, obviously.
[03:41:31.089 --> 03:41:33.853]  A bigger question, they say, is how could they not have known?
[03:41:39.321 --> 03:41:41.182]  Jason Burmiss in studio with us.
[03:41:41.182 --> 03:41:44.564]  Burmiss just got involved with the Loose Change guys after Dylan made the first one.
[03:41:44.564 --> 03:41:46.605]  Then he helped make the second and third one.
[03:41:46.605 --> 03:41:49.926]  You've been, I guess with Loose Change guys, what, two and a half years?
[03:41:49.926 --> 03:41:57.150]  And so now you're making the film you want to make, and it gets into the British, Israeli, Pakistani intelligence, all working together, all involved.
[03:41:57.876 --> 03:42:04.241]  Tied into the White House, and it's so mentally ill and sick that people out there say, Oh, you're saying others were involved?
[03:42:04.241 --> 03:42:05.241]  No, it's only Israel.
[03:42:05.241 --> 03:42:06.763]  No, it's not only Israel.
[03:42:06.763 --> 03:42:10.045]  But saying that Israel's involved doesn't give them cover either.
[03:42:10.045 --> 03:42:13.187]  I mean, what kind of mental problem is that?
[03:42:13.187 --> 03:42:17.631]  What type of major malfunction if we bust ten guys robbing a bank?
[03:42:17.631 --> 03:42:17.991]  All ten.
[03:42:19.207 --> 03:42:20.588]  Are just as equally guilty.
[03:42:20.588 --> 03:42:26.792]  The fact that they have accomplices doesn't make them less guilty, it makes them more guilty with the conspiracy, with the forethought.
[03:42:26.792 --> 03:42:33.876]  But yes, we're weighing in, as four of my other films do, on this subject we've always covered.
[03:42:33.876 --> 03:42:40.119]  And all the guests we've had on, Galen Ross, Tex Mars, just countless others covering these type issues.
[03:42:40.119 --> 03:42:42.221]  But this is really a professional film.
[03:42:42.221 --> 03:42:43.501]  It's been done for a week.
[03:42:43.501 --> 03:42:44.782]  The DVD's being mass produced.
[03:42:44.782 --> 03:42:45.723]  It's coming in next week.
[03:42:45.723 --> 03:42:47.304]  We're going to ship it out September 1st.
[03:42:48.024 --> 03:42:48.525]  Pre-orders!
[03:42:48.525 --> 03:42:53.749]  Remember to pre-order the DVD so you get it first when it ships out September 1st at InfoWars.com.
[03:42:53.749 --> 03:42:54.570]  The trailers are out there.
[03:42:54.570 --> 03:42:57.093]  It's going to be at PrisonPlanet.tv for members.
[03:42:57.093 --> 03:42:58.154]  Burma's just in three minutes.
[03:42:58.154 --> 03:43:01.717]  Describe to people a basic rundown of what this film covers.
[03:43:02.341 --> 03:43:15.247]  Well, like you were talking about, this covers not only the Israeli involvement, but the Pakistani involvement, the Saudi Arabian involvement, and even the involvement in our own government, especially those taking part in continuity of government exercises that day.
[03:43:15.247 --> 03:43:24.972]  And how the black-op government uses the cover, the separate government outside, to be able to carry it out, then they use the contractors or the agents to do it, out of Israel, out of Pakistan.
[03:43:24.972 --> 03:43:28.554]  And what this really does speak to is the compartmentalization of the entire op.
[03:43:29.034 --> 03:43:32.575]  Okay, you had Pakistan playing its role to fund the Patsy's.
[03:43:32.575 --> 03:43:35.596]  They were funding the hijackers probably through U.S.
[03:43:35.596 --> 03:43:36.957]  and British intelligence.
[03:43:36.957 --> 03:43:44.399]  However, they're set up as possibly an enemy in the war on terror and it doesn't take them long to fold and then let U.S.
[03:43:44.399 --> 03:43:47.561]  forces mass in Pakistan to go into Afghanistan.
[03:43:47.561 --> 03:43:49.221]  So we point that out.
[03:43:49.221 --> 03:43:54.063]  We point out the Israeli operative teams that were picked up on 9-11, the ones that were
[03:43:54.643 --> 03:43:54.903]  Continue!
[03:43:54.903 --> 03:43:55.043]  Well,
[03:44:24.062 --> 03:44:27.165]  On top of all this, we also get in the continuity of government.
[03:44:27.165 --> 03:44:28.606]  Now that's going to be the third trailer.
[03:44:28.606 --> 03:44:32.309]  That's going to be out in a little bit, probably a little over a week or so.
[03:44:32.309 --> 03:44:34.651]  We've already given you two trailers.
[03:44:34.651 --> 03:44:40.076]  But we show you how this was all set into place through war games, exercises.
[03:44:40.076 --> 03:44:44.300]  Not only the ones done by NORAD, like Vigilant Warrior and Vigilant Guardian.
[03:44:45.359 --> 03:44:55.410]  But also, Global Guardian, which was this mass Armageddon exercise that put operational air command centers in the air called E-4Bs.
[03:44:55.410 --> 03:45:03.199]  Now, we had five of these planes, quote-unquote, doomsday planes, in the air on 9-11, and we know that one was on the scene in the Pentagon.
[03:45:03.199 --> 03:45:04.441]  Now, that's got a little bit of play.
[03:45:04.441 --> 03:45:05.682]  It was on CNN and whatnot.
[03:45:05.782 --> 03:45:07.904]  And we're going to talk more about this throughout the week and the whole week.
[03:45:07.904 --> 03:45:10.046]  You're going to be here while I'm at the DNC with live reports.
[03:45:10.046 --> 03:45:11.547]  You're going to be here covering that.
[03:45:11.547 --> 03:45:15.590]  Bottom line, we really went and looked and said, how was this carried out?
[03:45:15.590 --> 03:45:16.851]  How did they do it?
[03:45:16.851 --> 03:45:20.394]  We just looked at the facts and we bring you from the intelligence side.
[03:45:20.394 --> 03:45:24.618]  This doesn't look at blowing up buildings or all the things that show they did it or that it was an inside job.
[03:45:25.238 --> 03:45:26.279]  This film is different.
[03:45:26.279 --> 03:45:32.865]  It looks at how they did it, how they operated, and it totally proves the case, and it shows you what we found.
[03:45:32.865 --> 03:45:37.809]  It shows you how they did it, and it should... People say, how did they do it then?
[03:45:37.809 --> 03:45:39.850]  We always say, well, we know they're lying about the official story.
[03:45:39.850 --> 03:45:41.471]  We know their fingerprints are all over it.
[03:45:41.471 --> 03:45:42.352]  We know they had a motive.
[03:45:42.352 --> 03:45:44.534]  We know they wrote documents saying they wanted to state the tax.
[03:45:44.534 --> 03:45:47.636]  We know they've posed a tax in the past.
[03:45:47.636 --> 03:45:50.098]  This film goes, okay, you want to know how they did it?
[03:45:50.098 --> 03:45:50.499]  Here it is.
[03:45:51.101 --> 03:45:52.403]  You want to know how these murderers did it?
[03:45:52.403 --> 03:45:53.504]  You want to know who did it?
[03:45:53.504 --> 03:45:53.945]  Here it is.
[03:45:53.945 --> 03:45:56.408]  It's fabled enemies putting our neck in nooses.
[03:45:56.408 --> 03:45:57.590]  Good job, Jason Burmess.
[03:45:57.590 --> 03:45:58.351]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:45:58.351 --> 03:45:58.631]  You bet.
[03:45:58.631 --> 03:46:00.093]  The trailer's up on InfoWars.com.

[03:46:11.542 --> 03:46:13.322]  America, freedom to fascism.

[03:47:09.968 --> 03:47:16.851]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.

[03:48:00.962 --> 03:48:04.044]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[03:48:04.044 --> 03:48:09.566]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[03:48:09.566 --> 03:48:15.269]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[03:48:15.269 --> 03:48:16.770]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:48:16.770 --> 03:48:25.634]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[03:48:25.814 --> 03:48:26.074]  Of course!

[03:49:12.063 --> 03:49:39.999]  Caught like a wildfire out of control There was nothing left to burn and nothing left to lose All those pictures days are past me now I've got so much more to think about Deadlines Deadlines and commitments What to leave in What to leave out Against the wind
[03:49:44.045 --> 03:49:49.609]  We were young and strong, but we were still running against the wind.
[03:49:49.609 --> 03:50:02.256]  Okay, I'm going to talk more about this tomorrow because they're great, but the winners of the Internet Censorship and Truth Rising Trailer Contest have been announced in the first wave.
[03:50:02.256 --> 03:50:07.920]  And the two that win the smaller prizes, I told everybody, you're now disqualified from the next contest.
[03:50:08.755 --> 03:50:13.958]  Uh, but next time we have a contest, that'll be, closes out the 19th, I've got to announce that the 20th.
[03:50:13.958 --> 03:50:21.302]  But you get a hundred, two hundred, I don't know what it is, it's over a hundred entries, it becomes quite a job just to judge these.
[03:50:21.302 --> 03:50:24.643]  So I took an extra day and a half to announce it, and I'm evil.
[03:50:24.643 --> 03:50:33.388]  Uh, but, uh, due to the overwhelming response to Alex Jones' Net Censorship and Truth Rising trailer contest, won $2,000 versus $1,000, the big $5,000 one's coming up.
[03:50:33.388 --> 03:50:35.869]  People get confused and say I'm now saying it's a smaller prize.
[03:50:35.869 --> 03:50:37.630]  No, there's multiple prizes.
[03:50:38.297 --> 03:50:40.819]  It was difficult to choose the first wave of winners.
[03:50:40.819 --> 03:50:41.840]  All the entries are excellent.
[03:50:41.840 --> 03:50:48.005]  Remember, we have another wave of contest, and these will all be judged on Thursday, August 19th.
[03:50:48.005 --> 03:50:53.670]  And, uh, stay tuned for those winners, and thanks for participating in the InfoWar.
[03:50:53.670 --> 03:51:03.739]  Now, now, this was judged, I said off of basic net numbers, uh, well, I said the one about internet censorship would be the other truth rising, I said I would judge by quality, but it also got a lot.
[03:51:03.739 --> 03:51:04.700]  Uh, enough respect
[03:51:05.846 --> 03:51:08.808]  One, before I even ever found out about it, it had 40,000 views.
[03:51:08.808 --> 03:51:12.570]  It's like 60,000 views now.
[03:51:12.570 --> 03:51:17.773]  And so we are very, very, very excited about that.
[03:51:17.773 --> 03:51:23.996]  And you can go to InfoWars.com and watch that trailer right now, which is at 55,263 views.
[03:51:23.996 --> 03:51:24.617]  And so they are the
[03:51:31.738 --> 03:51:35.421]  Winner of the first contest on Internet Censorship.
[03:51:35.421 --> 03:51:42.586]  The other one, I'm trying to go to the YouTube channel so I can give you the actual winner off their page.
[03:51:42.586 --> 03:51:45.948]  For the Truth Rising, they get $1,000 and their site is otero1.com
[03:51:52.288 --> 03:51:58.694]  And, uh, theirs has only had, like, three and a half thousand views, but it is the Truth Rising trailer, and it is the best judged by me.
[03:51:58.694 --> 03:51:59.555]  The other one had the most, yes.
[03:51:59.555 --> 03:52:01.757]  The other one was just being judged on which one I liked the best.
[03:52:01.757 --> 03:52:02.517]  I loved all the others.
[03:52:02.517 --> 03:52:03.859]  They were so good, that was the problem.
[03:52:03.859 --> 03:52:06.221]  I had to watch them over and over again.
[03:52:06.221 --> 03:52:15.389]  I want to thank everybody out there for their support, and you all win by getting the word out about the police state, about the New World Order, about the censorship, so I commend you all.
