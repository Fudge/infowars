[00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:09.802]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.802 --> 00:00:11.383]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.383 --> 00:00:12.943]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.943 --> 00:00:17.144]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.144 --> 00:00:29.148]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.148 --> 00:00:33.829]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we are back for the very first time
[00:00:34.782 --> 00:00:38.085]  It is Wednesday, August 27, 2008.
[00:00:38.085 --> 00:00:47.451]  I am Jason Burmess, sitting in today and tomorrow for Alex Jones, and then Friday we're going to do a best of and play some clips that we did not play on the radio show from it.
[00:00:47.451 --> 00:00:51.114]  Alex's adventures over at the DNC, another jam-packed day.
[00:00:51.114 --> 00:00:57.519]  Yesterday, Jones got on Russia Today, which is just a huge, huge show all across the world.
[00:00:58.962 --> 00:01:08.945]  He did numerous radio and TV interviews, and he took over MSNBC for around three minutes, and we're going to be playing that later on.
[00:01:08.945 --> 00:01:22.749]  But coming up right after this short break, we're going to go to Paul Craig Roberts and get his take on the Georgia-Russia situation, where it's going, if it's going to escalate, if it's going to de-escalate.
[00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:26.330]  If we're going to see another Cold War style
[00:01:28.502 --> 00:01:30.003]  Ara, I don't know what to think.
[00:01:30.003 --> 00:01:34.327]  You know, obviously, Saakashvili is NATO-hungry.
[00:01:34.327 --> 00:01:36.909]  He's been trying to get into NATO for quite some time.
[00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.451]  He is a globalist.
[00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:45.435]  He had the third largest amount of troops in Iraq.
[00:01:45.435 --> 00:01:47.297]  Highly pro-US.
[00:01:47.297 --> 00:01:48.338]  And he's a good speaker.
[00:01:48.338 --> 00:01:57.585]  You know, I keep going back to this, but when I watched him, and I watched him pretty much that whole week, but the Glenn Beck interview with him really, really stood out.
[00:01:58.513 --> 00:02:02.816]  And you know what, maybe we're going to play some of that too, because I do want to play that.
[00:02:02.816 --> 00:02:15.303]  But, he's sitting there with Glenn Beck, he's talking about how, you know, they're living in this Orwellian world, and Russia's lying, and you can't trust them, and they're for freedom and democracy, you know, classic doublespeak.
[00:02:15.303 --> 00:02:19.505]  He even uses the term, uh, doublespeak.
[00:02:19.505 --> 00:02:27.050]  And, lo and behold, all of a sudden in the third segment, after he's been talking to Glenn Beck for, uh, you know, twenty or so minutes,
[00:02:28.587 --> 00:02:32.130]  He's like, you gotta understand, Russia is against all this stuff.
[00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.591]  This is about the future of Europe.
[00:02:33.591 --> 00:02:35.412]  This is about the future of the New World Order.
[00:02:35.412 --> 00:02:39.235]  You know, the New World Order that does not exist.
[00:02:39.235 --> 00:02:46.020]  So yeah, I'm gonna have to send that clip over to John Harmon and we're gonna play that for Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:52.104]  When he comes on, and Paul Craig Roberts has really done some amazing work over at Counterpunch and other publications as of recent.
[00:02:52.104 --> 00:02:54.246]  I mean, he's quite old school.
[00:02:54.246 --> 00:02:56.588]  He has a huge body of work, but I've been reading his
[00:02:57.765 --> 00:03:15.173]  Latest stuff and he's he's not really pulling any punches at all and Thank God because we need people to tell it like it is tell the straight dope because 90% of the media is still parroting that Russia is the aggressor poor little old Georgia.
[00:03:15.173 --> 00:03:19.815]  How dare Russia go into South Ossetia and then into Georgia?
[00:03:19.815 --> 00:03:25.318]  No they wanted to South Ossetia when Georgia began ethnically cleansing the citizens there and
[00:03:25.777 --> 00:03:37.060]  After they had run some drills, basically before they'd run the drills, were moving in radar equipment, other military equipment, then US Special Forces are there, Israeli Special Forces are there, they start running these drills now.
[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.861]  To counteract these drills, Georgia starts running drills on their border as well.
[00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:51.384]  Kind of figuring that there will be some kind of an altercation or aggression and sure enough, you know, and a lot of people, we had a caller yesterday call in and say, well how do you know that Russia
[00:03:52.148 --> 00:03:53.229]  isn't setting this whole thing up.
[00:03:53.229 --> 00:04:05.795]  Well, a 12-year-old girl from San Francisco gets on Fox News, says that she's in South Osatia, and all of a sudden, they're attacked by the Georgians.
[00:04:05.795 --> 00:04:15.861]  They had to spend the night in her grandfather's basement, and then the next day, the Russian troops are the ones that got her out of the country, into Russia, and onto a plane into the United States, and they cut her off!
[00:04:15.861 --> 00:04:20.563]  That accompanied with Sokovsvili's little New World Order slip-up.
[00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:29.697]  You know, make me about 99.999999 percent certain that Russia, in this case, is not the aggressor.
[00:04:29.697 --> 00:04:32.399]  And we have Pat Buchanan!
[00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:34.240]  One of the most mainline politicians out there.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.082]  One of the better Republicans, I guess.
[00:04:36.082 --> 00:04:41.286]  But he's done a huge piece on Georgia being the aggressor.
[00:04:41.286 --> 00:04:42.587]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:42.587 --> 00:04:48.271]  We'll be back after this with Paul Craig Roberts, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:09.070]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.771]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:05:10.771 --> 00:05:13.673]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:05:13.673 --> 00:05:18.717]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:05:18.717 --> 00:05:26.962]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[00:05:26.962 --> 00:05:31.885]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:43.162]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:05:43.162 --> 00:05:46.026]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:05:46.026 --> 00:05:52.513]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[00:05:52.513 --> 00:05:55.356]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[00:05:55.356 --> 00:05:57.619]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:05:57.619 --> 00:06:00.102]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:06:01.016 --> 00:06:06.720]  I am at a gathering of friends, minding my own business, when one of our buddies, Bob, walks up to me, very concerned.
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.462]  He says, wow, have you seen the gasoline prices lately?
[00:06:09.462 --> 00:06:10.683]  I said, oh, of course.
[00:06:10.683 --> 00:06:11.924]  Woo, they're high.
[00:06:11.924 --> 00:06:12.404]  He says, yeah.
[00:06:12.404 --> 00:06:13.525]  He says, what am I going to do?
[00:06:13.525 --> 00:06:14.105]  I've got a truck.
[00:06:14.105 --> 00:06:17.027]  There's no way anybody's going to buy my truck in this market.
[00:06:17.027 --> 00:06:18.929]  I really need the truck for my job.
[00:06:18.929 --> 00:06:20.930]  It uses more gas than I can afford.
[00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.172]  I've got to find a way to come up with some extra money.
[00:06:23.172 --> 00:06:24.853]  I've got a wife with four kids at home.
[00:06:24.853 --> 00:06:25.954]  I don't know what to do.
[00:06:25.954 --> 00:06:27.014]  I said, Bob, relax.
[00:06:27.014 --> 00:06:27.675]  I know what to do.
[00:06:28.235 --> 00:06:32.539]  Call eFoodsDirect.com or go up on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:43.087]  They will deliver food, really good, high-quality, nutritional, delicious food to your door, your door now, right there in front of your house, for about half the price that you were paying for groceries last year.
[00:06:43.087 --> 00:06:50.673]  You can take the savings from that, offset the cost of your fuel, and use it to buy more inexpensive food to hedge against tomorrow's increasing food prices.
[00:06:50.933 --> 00:06:52.114]  Why don't you do that, Bob?
[00:06:52.114 --> 00:06:53.155]  He said, eFoodsDirect.com?
[00:06:53.155 --> 00:06:53.415]  I said, yep.
[00:06:53.415 --> 00:06:54.095]  Call them at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:06:54.095 --> 00:06:54.416]  That's 800-409-5633.

[00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:19.693]  If you've been thinking of a nutrient-dense daily food source and a storable food for yourself and family, the time to act is now.

[00:08:02.354 --> 00:08:04.395]  You know, it's not the fact that I was targeted.
[00:08:04.395 --> 00:08:08.477]  My people has been targeted and I couldn't care less whether I was targeted.
[00:08:08.477 --> 00:08:11.238]  The worst thing was that I was standing there with my people.
[00:08:11.238 --> 00:08:14.239]  They were bombed and I was just targeted like them.
[00:08:14.239 --> 00:08:18.881]  And as elected president, officially in charge of their protection, I couldn't do anything about it.
[00:08:18.881 --> 00:08:21.542]  But the point here is, it's not about me.
[00:08:21.542 --> 00:08:23.203]  It's about the idea of freedom.
[00:08:23.203 --> 00:08:24.964]  It's about the future of the whole region.
[00:08:24.964 --> 00:08:28.205]  It's about the future of Europe and a new world order.
[00:08:28.205 --> 00:08:30.846]  And what I think is that no matter what Russians do,
[00:08:31.586 --> 00:08:35.948]  I told them, and I was asking what would be my message to the Russians.
[00:08:35.948 --> 00:08:52.957]  Here you go, Saakashvili, blatantly talking about the New World Order, the New World Order that doesn't exist, this idea of globalism, this idea of global government, and joining us now to comment on the entire situation in that region, in Georgia, South Ossetia and Russia, Paul Craig Roberts, thanks for being here.
[00:08:53.752 --> 00:08:54.652]  Hey, how are you?
[00:08:54.652 --> 00:09:02.014]  I am very, very good and, uh, you know, Alex has gone over your latest article on the air and I've read it and it's, it's a bang up article.
[00:09:02.014 --> 00:09:07.176]  I mean, your last like three or four, you really, you're really not pulling any punches at all.
[00:09:07.176 --> 00:09:10.317]  Well, um, I'm just telling the truth.
[00:09:10.317 --> 00:09:21.620]  Um, but we, we are being led, uh, rather rapidly into a nuclear confrontation with Russia for no, no reason, no purpose other than, uh, an insane,
[00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:28.222]  Uh, policy of the neocons for American hegemony.
[00:09:28.222 --> 00:09:44.547]  And, uh, this is why I've never really thought much of the new world order, because the only world order that the neocons, who control American foreign policy, are interested in is American hegemony, American rule.
[00:09:44.547 --> 00:09:52.269]  And, uh, the United States doesn't have the military or financial power to impose itself on the world.
[00:09:54.141 --> 00:10:00.830]  We have to understand Russia is a big place, and it's heavily armed, and China is another big place, and they're our bankers.
[00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:10.904]  We're totally dependent on Chinese financing of our consumption and of the daily operations of the federal government in Washington.
[00:10:12.139 --> 00:10:25.102]  So you believe this could be it, that they really do want this global nuclear insanity, really, I don't know, depending on how you look at it, World War III, World War IV, just like an apocalyptic conflict, you really think this could happen?
[00:10:25.102 --> 00:10:28.423]  Yeah, I think we're very close to it.
[00:10:28.423 --> 00:10:33.545]  I would give it almost total certainty if John McCain gets in office.
[00:10:36.314 --> 00:10:43.219]  The neoconservatives, as everyone should know by now, are insane.
[00:10:43.219 --> 00:10:55.088]  I mean, remember now that the invasion of Iraq, which was orchestrated on lies and deception, was supposed to be a six-week war.
[00:10:55.088 --> 00:10:56.769]  And it's now in six years.
[00:11:00.459 --> 00:11:03.901]  The war in Afghanistan is going on.
[00:11:03.901 --> 00:11:16.968]  What do you think about these latest proposals where they're saying that in 2012 now is going to be the complete de-escalation but then when you read further into the policy they say that they're going to just slowly start retracting troops there and it'll be over another three-year period.
[00:11:16.968 --> 00:11:20.409]  So now we're looking publicly at being in Iraq until 2015.
[00:11:20.409 --> 00:11:25.652]  Well, I don't think it will happen.
[00:11:25.652 --> 00:11:27.973]  What the Iraqis have done
[00:11:29.987 --> 00:11:46.794]  Is to stop their fighting among themselves in order to undermine the Bush regime propaganda that our troops are necessary there to prevent a bloodbath.
[00:11:46.794 --> 00:11:58.759]  So, having already cleansed each other from their neighborhoods, the Sunnis and Shiites, they've decided, hey, we're stopping this.
[00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:19.096]  Al Sater was told by the Iranians to stand down his militias and to create the absence of the kind of conflict that the Bush administration was using to justify its continued presence.
[00:12:19.096 --> 00:12:26.518]  So that is the policy, and we can see that our puppet president there is less and less a puppet, more and more
[00:12:27.352 --> 00:12:37.980]  The spokesman for the Shiites and for Iraq and is insisting on the time schedule withdrawal.
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:50.489]  And so I think if we try to stay there against this opposition, that the war will start over in this time.
[00:12:50.489 --> 00:12:52.371]  And most of the fighting will not be
[00:12:53.214 --> 00:12:59.115]  The Shiites and the Sunnis killing each other, but they will both jump on us.
[00:12:59.115 --> 00:13:01.676]  And we will be driven out.
[00:13:01.676 --> 00:13:08.838]  The only reason we weren't driven out is that we never had to deal with more than a few thousand insurgents.
[00:13:08.838 --> 00:13:19.400]  Because the Iraqis were mainly fighting each other, cleansing each other of neighborhoods, and gave us very little attention.
[00:13:19.887 --> 00:13:26.709]  So you think our policy of divide and conquer is eventually going to fail and that these people are going to unify and really try to drive us out?
[00:13:26.709 --> 00:13:28.449]  But I mean, when do you think that could happen?
[00:13:28.449 --> 00:13:30.370]  We just keep pushing the date back.
[00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:33.810]  Look, we're deluded.
[00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:35.071]  We've always been deluded.
[00:13:35.071 --> 00:13:39.232]  We said it was going to be a six-week war.
[00:13:39.232 --> 00:13:40.772]  We're deluded.
[00:13:40.772 --> 00:13:42.633]  We've been deluded about the war.
[00:13:42.633 --> 00:13:46.013]  We're deluded about a surge.
[00:13:46.013 --> 00:13:47.394]  All that happened is what I said.
[00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:52.210]  Had finished cleansing the neighborhoods.
[00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:57.911]  And the Sunnis, the Sunni insurgents, were all put on the American payroll.
[00:13:57.911 --> 00:14:02.232]  We have 80,000 of them now that we pay.
[00:14:02.232 --> 00:14:08.213]  And so that stopped their interest in fighting.
[00:14:08.213 --> 00:14:16.475]  And the Shiites are now unified with Iranian advice and backing to stop the conflict
[00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:32.379]  So that it deprives Bush, or the Americans in general, of the propaganda that if we aren't there, there'll be a bloodshed, there'll be a bloodletting, and so on and so on.
[00:14:32.379 --> 00:14:41.825]  So, as long as that is the situation, there's no excuse for the American troops to be there.
[00:14:41.825 --> 00:14:47.149]  And therefore, if we try to stay and stay and stay, I think we'll see
[00:14:48.268 --> 00:14:54.411]  That the Iraqi government and the Shiites will turn against us.
[00:14:54.411 --> 00:15:02.754]  And we never were faced with much opposition from the Shiites, because that's the vast majority of them.
[00:15:02.754 --> 00:15:13.719]  And they didn't really oppose us because they knew they were going to inherit the power from the Sunnis, from our presence.
[00:15:13.719 --> 00:15:15.179]  And they have.
[00:15:15.179 --> 00:15:16.780]  And essentially, we have
[00:15:17.996 --> 00:15:32.387]  Uh, ended the check on Iran that the Sunni secular government of Iraq presented, and we've now put Iran, uh, Iraq in the hands of the Shiites, who are allied with Iran.
[00:15:32.387 --> 00:15:40.214]  So, they're not going to tolerate our permanent presence there, whatever, um, delusions
[00:15:41.081 --> 00:15:43.283]  The American government might have.
[00:15:43.283 --> 00:15:45.924]  Well, where is Iran right now in this grand chessboard?
[00:15:45.924 --> 00:15:51.248]  I mean, obviously focus has kind of shifted away with this conflict out in Russia.
[00:15:51.248 --> 00:16:05.677]  But, I mean, we had Cheney, it just came out with Hirsch about a month ago, saying that he was prepared to dress, I believe it was US Navy SEALs up like the enemy in little PT boats and have a firefight to try to provocate a war with Iran.
[00:16:05.677 --> 00:16:06.638]  Are we still going to go there?
[00:16:06.638 --> 00:16:08.259]  Are we still trying to get into that country?
[00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:33.073]  Yes, we're still trying to, well, I don't say we, Cheney and the neocons and Israel are still trying to provoke a war with Iran, but now I think they're more interested in provoking Russia because the Russians have rejected the
[00:16:34.193 --> 00:16:41.818]  Attempt by the Americans and the Israelis to exercise hegemony over them in Georgia.
[00:16:41.818 --> 00:16:51.445]  And they've made it quite clear that they've rejected this, and they've now recognized the two separatist provinces.
[00:16:51.445 --> 00:16:55.368]  There's nothing we can do about it.
[00:16:55.368 --> 00:16:58.050]  And what we will attempt to do is to proceed
[00:16:58.899 --> 00:17:06.422]  We're putting missile bases in Poland and Czechoslovakia and Kosovo and the Ukraine.
[00:17:06.422 --> 00:17:22.850]  We will now take the efforts that were defeated by the Russians in Georgia to Ukraine and try to turn them into an American puppet state with missile bases on Russia's border.
[00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:25.451]  And the Russians are probably not going to put up with that either.
[00:17:26.903 --> 00:17:48.390]  And so what we have is a very belligerent, aggressive American policy toward Russia, which has thousands of nuclear weapons, and has already made it clear that they don't have the smart weapons and electronic warfare of the Americans.
[00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:53.472]  And so if they're confronting that, they're going to reply with tactical nukes to neutralize it.
[00:17:55.468 --> 00:17:59.051]  We saw that in Georgia when they moved in those two SS-21s.
[00:17:59.051 --> 00:18:03.174]  Those are nuclear-capable missiles.
[00:18:03.174 --> 00:18:18.765]  So, the American government, with its insane policy that somehow it has to have a hedge enemy over Russia and boss Russia around, is following a course of action that is going to provoke a nuclear confrontation with Russia.
[00:18:18.765 --> 00:18:20.126]  And there's no reason for it.
[00:18:20.126 --> 00:18:21.687]  It's pointless.
[00:18:21.687 --> 00:18:22.468]  It's an insane
[00:18:23.493 --> 00:18:24.314]  I just wanted more control.
[00:18:24.314 --> 00:18:27.298]  Again and again and again it was never enough control.
[00:18:38.931 --> 00:18:42.814]  What is the neoconservative policy?
[00:18:42.814 --> 00:18:44.215]  I have to agree with you there.
[00:18:44.215 --> 00:18:48.599]  How do you think the globe is going to slice up, though, and who will be whose ally?
[00:18:48.599 --> 00:18:57.426]  I mean, I'd obviously think that in Europe, allies, you know, Britain's obviously going to be our ally, but I could see maybe France and Germany not siding with us.
[00:18:57.426 --> 00:18:59.808]  I mean, what do you think?
[00:18:59.808 --> 00:19:05.733]  Well, obviously Russia and China will be allies, and that neutralizes us right there.
[00:19:06.938 --> 00:19:09.659]  The question then is, what will Japan do?
[00:19:09.659 --> 00:19:15.342]  Will it eventually desert us, remembering that they were nuked?
[00:19:15.342 --> 00:19:21.825]  And here we are, threatening more nuclear devastation somewhere else.
[00:19:21.825 --> 00:19:23.565]  Europe, the leaders are bought.
[00:19:23.565 --> 00:19:25.006]  We buy them.
[00:19:25.006 --> 00:19:31.009]  Whoever they elect, we make them rich so that they do what we want.
[00:19:31.009 --> 00:19:33.170]  They always desert their own people.
[00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:36.011]  They betray their own people because they get money from us.
[00:19:37.262 --> 00:19:45.886]  So they'll likely, unless the fear of war with Russia breaks that, which it could do.
[00:19:45.886 --> 00:19:50.808]  All right, we'll be back after this with more from Paul Craig Roberts at the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:50.808 --> 00:19:52.469]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:20:00.723 --> 00:20:07.493]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:20:07.493 --> 00:20:10.116]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:20:10.116 --> 00:20:11.679]  But who is the enemy?
[00:20:11.679 --> 00:20:12.480]  Bin Laden.
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:13.341]  This is his MO.
[00:20:13.341 --> 00:20:14.843]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:20:14.843 --> 00:20:16.305]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:20:16.806 --> 00:20:23.975]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:20:23.975 --> 00:20:24.455]  Some U.S.
[00:20:24.455 --> 00:20:30.823]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:20:30.823 --> 00:20:34.268]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:20:34.508 --> 00:20:44.778]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:20:44.778 --> 00:20:46.019]  Fabled enemies.

[00:22:24.352 --> 00:22:27.093]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[00:22:27.093 --> 00:22:29.214]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.

[00:23:05.211 --> 00:23:13.034]  The added threat of invisible radio waves sending out personal information to anyone willing to receive them makes our privacy as citizens even less secure.
[00:23:13.034 --> 00:23:16.796]  The RFID tags and ID cards have been proven to be not secure.
[00:23:16.796 --> 00:23:20.977]  Thieves are able to read information stored on these tags to steal your identity.

[00:23:52.942 --> 00:23:55.183]  Alright folks, it is the Alex Jones Show!
[00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:19.633]  I'm Jason Burmas subbing in until Thursday and then Friday we're going to do a Best of the Week.
[00:24:19.633 --> 00:24:27.819]  Alex down at the DNC going to be joining us shortly and we have no shortage of news clips of Alex Jones we're going to be playing after Paul Craig Roberts leaves us.
[00:24:27.819 --> 00:24:30.881]  We have actually Alex on Russia Today yesterday.
[00:24:30.881 --> 00:24:36.925]  We have Michelle Malkin basically on Fox News ripping into Alex, the 9-11 Truth Movement and others.
[00:24:38.055 --> 00:24:40.796]  And, uh, Alex is probably going to be on Inside Edition today.
[00:24:40.796 --> 00:24:42.797]  You know, he's been non-stop over at the DNC.
[00:24:42.797 --> 00:24:47.638]  You can watch live video streams over at Infowars.com right now.
[00:24:47.638 --> 00:25:01.903]  But we're talking to Paul Craig Roberts, and we're talking about this, uh, global conflict with Russia, and how the rest of the world is going to decide, you know, if this does become quote-unquote World War III, World War IV, whichever one you want.
[00:25:01.903 --> 00:25:06.865]  And, you know, it's so hard to, uh, go over these things, predict these things, but
[00:25:07.691 --> 00:25:13.956]  Well, I mean, obviously the outcome is going to be the end of American dominance, don't you think?
[00:25:13.956 --> 00:25:17.039]  Yes, and the end of life on Earth.
[00:25:17.039 --> 00:25:19.901]  You have to take this seriously.
[00:25:19.901 --> 00:25:30.210]  This is a far more serious situation than anything that we ever faced with the Soviet Union, because there was mutual assured destruction.
[00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:36.495]  Neither side had any world-dominant claims.
[00:25:37.558 --> 00:25:41.359]  And they were sitting there as checks on one another.
[00:25:41.359 --> 00:25:51.841]  What we have now is the United States with a world-dominant claim, and a war doctrine that supports that claim.
[00:25:51.841 --> 00:26:01.464]  The Bush administration has already altered the American war doctrine, enshrining preemptive nuclear attack.
[00:26:01.464 --> 00:26:06.545]  They have broken the agreement Reagan had with Gorbachev, inter-building anti-missile
[00:26:07.922 --> 00:26:20.688]  Uh, defense systems and are, uh, installing these on Russia's borders in an effort to negate the Soviet nuclear deterrence so that we can bully them and make them do what we want.
[00:26:20.688 --> 00:26:22.950]  Now, Russia will not stand still for this.
[00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:24.811]  This is moving very rapidly.
[00:26:24.811 --> 00:26:26.591]  This isn't something that's going to happen in the next 50 years.
[00:26:26.591 --> 00:26:30.213]  It's going to happen in the next two or three years.
[00:26:30.213 --> 00:26:33.535]  It's moving very rapidly toward a confrontation.
[00:26:34.446 --> 00:26:45.411]  Now, the idiots in Washington thought they were going to get away with ethnically cleansing Russians out of those two Georgian provinces.
[00:26:45.411 --> 00:26:49.732]  They actually thought that Russia would simply let this happen, and they didn't.
[00:26:49.732 --> 00:26:51.913]  They stopped it.
[00:26:51.913 --> 00:26:54.995]  And now, and what was the American response?
[00:26:54.995 --> 00:27:02.838]  It very quickly gave more money to the Polish morons and got the agreement that the Poles wouldn't give them to put
[00:27:03.607 --> 00:27:06.388]  Missile bases in Poland.
[00:27:06.388 --> 00:27:09.508]  Russia has announced that, well, that may mean the end of Poland.
[00:27:09.508 --> 00:27:12.609]  They may simply nuke Poland.
[00:27:12.609 --> 00:27:18.190]  Today the headline is, Russia warns of military response to U.S.
[00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:21.770]  missiles.
[00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:26.491]  Russia, angry with the U.S., takes up the Afghan attack at the U.N.
[00:27:26.491 --> 00:27:31.552]  You know, where we've murdered another 60 Afghan kids and 30 Afghan women.
[00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:34.671]  Claiming they were Taliban.
[00:27:34.671 --> 00:27:37.873]  And now it's all been proved that we did do that.
[00:27:37.873 --> 00:27:41.435]  And the Russians now want us condemned.
[00:27:41.435 --> 00:27:48.638]  So they've become aggressive in response to our aggression.
[00:27:48.638 --> 00:27:57.422]  And the neocons are the kinds of people who say, what was Billy Crystal's statement?
[00:27:57.422 --> 00:27:58.443]  Isn't he the one who said,
[00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:02.551]  What's the use of having nuclear weapons if you can't use them?
[00:28:02.551 --> 00:28:06.693]  Yeah, the editor of the Weekly Standard and one of the big members of PNAC.
[00:28:06.693 --> 00:28:07.373]  Right.
[00:28:07.373 --> 00:28:11.235]  This is the mentality.
[00:28:11.235 --> 00:28:14.476]  It's the most insane criminal mentality.
[00:28:14.476 --> 00:28:18.517]  And they control United States foreign policy.
[00:28:18.517 --> 00:28:20.318]  So, it means war.
[00:28:20.318 --> 00:28:25.040]  You're headed very quickly into a nuclear war.
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:25.520]  Very quickly.
[00:28:27.563 --> 00:28:28.703]  What are we going to see in this country?
[00:28:28.703 --> 00:28:29.823]  Are we going to see conscription?
[00:28:29.823 --> 00:28:30.904]  Is it just going to be all out?
[00:28:30.904 --> 00:28:34.544]  No, there's not going to be time for conscription or training and all that.
[00:28:34.544 --> 00:28:35.984]  You're talking total chaos.
[00:28:35.984 --> 00:28:39.645]  This is where they bring in their privatized forces, NATO, the whole nine.
[00:28:39.645 --> 00:28:40.425]  It's just a global conflict.
[00:28:40.425 --> 00:28:43.466]  No, I'm talking about missiles that are going to launch.
[00:28:43.466 --> 00:28:44.786]  But you don't think there will be anything left?
[00:28:44.786 --> 00:28:45.746]  They're going to disappear.
[00:28:45.746 --> 00:28:48.007]  You just don't think there will be anything left of anything?
[00:28:48.007 --> 00:28:48.867]  No, nothing.
[00:28:48.867 --> 00:28:52.087]  Because the radiation is just too deadly.
[00:28:52.087 --> 00:28:52.927]  It's just too deadly.
[00:28:52.927 --> 00:28:55.848]  Look, we're not talking about little toy nuclear weapons.
[00:28:56.815 --> 00:28:58.155]  That we dropped on Japan.
[00:28:58.155 --> 00:29:03.256]  And we're talking about massive things, I mean.
[00:29:03.256 --> 00:29:11.318]  If an SS-18 hit Washington, it'd probably kill everybody from Boston to Atlanta.
[00:29:11.318 --> 00:29:12.238]  My God.
[00:29:12.238 --> 00:29:15.419]  So, you have to understand, this is a serious situation.
[00:29:15.419 --> 00:29:17.759]  We have an insane government.
[00:29:17.759 --> 00:29:20.460]  What is the United States government doing in Georgia?
[00:29:22.635 --> 00:29:25.098]  Okay, Roberts, I know that you have to go after this segment.
[00:29:25.098 --> 00:29:27.801]  Is there anything else you want to wrap it up with?
[00:29:27.801 --> 00:29:32.125]  No, I just think people need to be aware that this is a serious situation.
[00:29:32.125 --> 00:29:33.607]  Very serious.
[00:29:33.607 --> 00:29:36.069]  Well, the way you've described it, it's the most serious I've heard.
[00:29:36.069 --> 00:29:36.890]  I thank you for your time.
[00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:38.632]  I hope you can join us next week.
[00:29:38.632 --> 00:29:39.753]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:39.753 --> 00:29:41.395]  We're going to come back with a few news clips.
[00:29:41.395 --> 00:29:44.999]  I'm Jason Burma, sitting in InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:29:51.138 --> 00:29:55.063]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.063 --> 00:29:57.746]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.709 --> 00:30:02.670]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:06.291]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:30:06.291 --> 00:30:08.592]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:30:08.592 --> 00:30:11.774]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:30:11.774 --> 00:30:17.516]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:30:17.516 --> 00:30:21.418]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:30:21.758 --> 00:30:26.960]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:30.001]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.
[00:30:30.001 --> 00:30:37.223]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded or streamed in super high quality directly to your computer or iPhone and shared with others.
[00:30:37.223 --> 00:30:43.205]  Thousands of special video reports, from tainted vaccines to martial law, can be found in this online video library.
[00:30:43.205 --> 00:30:47.667]  My weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[00:30:48.007 --> 00:30:50.889]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.
[00:30:50.889 --> 00:30:52.930]  Join PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:54.931]  Burn the info bombs to disk.
[00:30:54.931 --> 00:30:57.052]  Put them on the file sharing networks.
[00:30:57.052 --> 00:30:58.833]  Bring down the New World Order.
[00:30:58.833 --> 00:31:00.574]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:31:00.574 --> 00:31:04.016]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[00:31:04.016 --> 00:31:06.317]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[00:31:06.317 --> 00:31:09.619]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[00:31:09.619 --> 00:31:16.043]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[00:31:16.483 --> 00:31:19.104]  Online from my desk with Webex.
[00:31:19.104 --> 00:31:22.404]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[00:31:22.404 --> 00:31:27.185]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[00:31:27.185 --> 00:31:31.126]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[00:31:31.126 --> 00:31:32.746]  Travel less, meet online.
[00:31:32.746 --> 00:31:35.427]  Go to Webex.com and try Webex free.

[00:31:41.348 --> 00:31:45.109]  Remember that code 500 to qualify for the free webcam.
[00:31:45.109 --> 00:31:45.409]  Webex.
[00:31:46.049 --> 00:31:46.209]  I think.
[00:32:01.067 --> 00:32:02.849]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:32:02.849 --> 00:32:09.815]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:32:09.815 --> 00:32:18.203]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:32:18.203 --> 00:32:23.929]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:32:24.209 --> 00:32:25.951]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:32:25.951 --> 00:32:28.233]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:32:28.233 --> 00:32:32.657]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:32:32.657 --> 00:32:34.879]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:32:34.879 --> 00:32:42.726]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:32:43.066 --> 00:32:43.466]  We're good.
[00:33:17.643 --> 00:33:24.306]  So much going on, so much going on.
[00:33:24.306 --> 00:33:28.467]  So many things going on in the world.
[00:33:28.467 --> 00:33:32.529]  Babies dying, mothers crying.
[00:33:32.529 --> 00:33:37.411]  How much all this one human life worth.
[00:33:43.121 --> 00:33:45.461]  No kidding, what happened to peace on earth?
[00:33:45.461 --> 00:33:56.924]  Folks, if you missed that interview with Paul Craig Roberts in the last two segments, that's a reason to hit the rebroadcast at Infowars.com after the fourth hour right there.
[00:33:56.924 --> 00:33:59.924]  I got chills right now, I hope he's dead wrong.
[00:33:59.924 --> 00:34:08.986]  I mean, he's literally talking about this country physically being wiped out, not the end of sovereignty, not us going to slave camps, us dead.
[00:34:10.956 --> 00:34:13.378]  Man, that was a rough interview.
[00:34:13.378 --> 00:34:15.240]  I'm not gonna lie, I'm still shaken by it.
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:16.821]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:34:16.821 --> 00:34:20.644]  I'm Jason Burma, sitting in on Wednesday, August 27, 2008.
[00:34:20.644 --> 00:34:22.886]  Man, almost September.
[00:34:22.886 --> 00:34:24.107]  Almost September 11th.
[00:34:24.107 --> 00:34:28.030]  We're really close to the 7-year anniversary of that event.
[00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:32.153]  And Alex Jones, myself, and others are going to be down there September 10th.
[00:34:32.153 --> 00:34:38.859]  Alex and myself are going to be showing Truth Rising and Fabled Enemies with Luke Rudowsky's WeAreChanged.org.
[00:34:38.859 --> 00:34:39.920]  You can go check that out.
[00:34:40.731 --> 00:34:40.951]  I think so.
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:05.561]  And spouted her vile, evil hatred.
[00:35:05.561 --> 00:35:10.285]  So we're going to play that, and then we're also going to play Alex on Russian TV.
[00:35:10.285 --> 00:35:13.848]  Fitting after that very hardcore conversation with Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:35:13.848 --> 00:35:15.870]  Alright, let's queue up Malkin.
[00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:17.592]  Oh Alex, nevermind, we won't queue up Malkin.
[00:35:17.592 --> 00:35:19.733]  We'll queue up Malkin after we talk to Alex.
[00:35:19.733 --> 00:35:21.375]  Alex, give us a report from the DNC!
[00:35:22.873 --> 00:35:27.836]  Okay, number one, we took over for a 45-minute hardball with Chris Matthews.
[00:35:27.836 --> 00:35:38.562]  There's 10-minute clips, 8-minute clips, 3-minute clips, different versions of it, where we chatted at InfoWars.com and Chris Matthews was live with a bullhorn and about 100 9-11 truthers at point-blank range.
[00:35:38.562 --> 00:35:42.664]  We had him threatened to arrest us again, but we were on the city sidewalk right up against it, so they couldn't.
[00:35:43.913 --> 00:35:44.533]  That happened.
[00:35:44.533 --> 00:35:48.234]  We've got two more days of major reportage here for you, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:48.234 --> 00:35:50.235]  The Malkin thing has just exploded.
[00:35:50.235 --> 00:35:52.696]  She went on Fox News and attacked me.
[00:35:52.696 --> 00:36:00.738]  Talk radio and blogs are misrepresenting everywhere that I said killer, but we have a major investigative breakthrough.
[00:36:00.738 --> 00:36:05.219]  Inside, or is it extra, is about to show up here at the condo we're staying at.
[00:36:05.219 --> 00:36:08.000]  We'll see if it's a hit piece or not.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.541]  We have a major investigative breakthrough.
[00:36:10.857 --> 00:36:18.110]  Now with local newspaper photos we've seen and the video that we've found, we now know that
[00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:31.900]  That there were several people with Malkin, the big bodyguard, another guy with a mustache who was a photographer, and then some frat boy bloggers who were with them, who were talking to them, who were getting what looked like orders from them.
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:36.003]  They would come over and pose behind me and say that they were with me.
[00:36:36.003 --> 00:36:49.154]  Then some of them and some others start screaming, kill Michelle Malkin, kill Michelle Malkin, kill Michelle Malkin, and then they start saying, why are you saying kill Michelle Malkin over and over again in just a massive, massive setup here.
[00:36:50.272 --> 00:36:54.917]  And then, we caught the same guy following us yesterday on the street.
[00:36:54.917 --> 00:36:56.179]  And we said, hey, that's the guy.
[00:36:56.179 --> 00:36:58.922]  And this was all streamed live on the web, so everybody saw it.
[00:36:58.922 --> 00:37:01.785]  It's posted at InfoWars.com.
[00:37:01.785 --> 00:37:02.786]  He ran off.
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:09.742]  But the incredible thing about this is we now have footage of them saying, kill, kill, kill.
[00:37:09.742 --> 00:37:17.205]  We now have the footage of them then going to the police and saying, Alex Jones says he wants to kill Michelle Malkin, kill Michelle Malkin.
[00:37:17.205 --> 00:37:21.807]  So we have the type of dirty tricks they play on video for everybody.
[00:37:21.807 --> 00:37:26.429]  And this is a big test to see whether we can expose what they've done, whether we can
[00:37:27.495 --> 00:37:32.636]  You know, basically, show the world what's really happening here, or will they have another propaganda victory?
[00:37:32.636 --> 00:37:40.259]  It's kind of like, uh, German talus, Gary Talus, was out there peacefully and got beat up, and then the Fox News said he beat up somebody in a wheelchair.
[00:37:40.259 --> 00:37:43.459]  Well, we didn't have any footage, so we couldn't defeat that lie.
[00:37:43.459 --> 00:37:51.622]  This time, we have the footage, and I have IM to Curt Nemo, local newspaper photos that show exactly what we talked about.
[00:37:51.622 --> 00:37:52.482]  We also have the video.
[00:37:53.442 --> 00:37:53.922]  Ourselves.
[00:37:53.922 --> 00:37:55.022]  We're just so busy.
[00:37:55.022 --> 00:37:57.563]  We haven't had time to dump from our hard cameras.
[00:37:57.563 --> 00:37:58.963]  All we have was the feed live.
[00:37:58.963 --> 00:38:00.604]  And, you know, that's a limited perspective.
[00:38:00.604 --> 00:38:09.486]  But from our other two cameras, you really get a clear picture of all these guys together, all of them working in unison to, in their words, punk me.
[00:38:09.486 --> 00:38:11.807]  You know, to set me up.
[00:38:11.807 --> 00:38:15.428]  And this is just absolutely unprecedented here.
[00:38:15.428 --> 00:38:18.548]  It's not just about Alex Jones or Fox News or Michelle Malkin.
[00:38:18.548 --> 00:38:20.089]  This is about disinformation.
[00:38:21.009 --> 00:38:22.009]  Alex, you still with us?
[00:38:22.009 --> 00:38:22.950]  What was that last part?
[00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:24.530]  I really think that the big issue here is
[00:38:46.078 --> 00:38:51.903]  One of the other big issues is the takeover of Chris Matthews because he says on there, well, it's a free country.
[00:38:51.903 --> 00:38:52.823]  This is how it is, folks.
[00:38:52.823 --> 00:38:54.945]  You can tell this country's free.
[00:38:54.945 --> 00:38:56.106]  And we sent you that clip, Jason.
[00:38:56.106 --> 00:38:57.067]  I want you to play it today.
[00:38:57.067 --> 00:38:59.969]  We're going to play it.
[00:38:59.969 --> 00:39:05.874]  And meanwhile, we had the NBC security saying, we're NBC security.
[00:39:05.874 --> 00:39:06.294]  Stop that.
[00:39:06.294 --> 00:39:07.235]  We're going to have you arrested.
[00:39:08.098 --> 00:39:11.139]  And they went and told the police to arrest us.
[00:39:11.139 --> 00:39:13.259]  And they moved in around us but did not arrest us.
[00:39:13.259 --> 00:39:19.541]  So a lot more restraint than what we've seen in New York City and in Ottawa and other areas around the world.
[00:39:19.541 --> 00:39:30.424]  But I'm just so excited when I call in the show because I'm in here in the condo with the guys and I'm watching them for the first time review the live, you know, crisp, high-definition video.
[00:39:30.424 --> 00:39:35.505]  It is unbelievable how we caught these people in an elaborate setup.
[00:39:36.045 --> 00:39:41.971]  And it turns out a day before, Malkin was in another confrontation with people, and their folks tried the same deal.
[00:39:41.971 --> 00:39:52.081]  So, you come up to Michelle Malkin, and you say, how dare you write books about putting Americans in camps, how dare you be for torture, how dare you say Alex Jones is a liar about the Marines killing the puppy.
[00:39:52.081 --> 00:39:53.543]  You come up to her for any reason.
[00:39:54.389 --> 00:40:01.113]  They will have people start shouting out, kill Michelle Malkin, kill Michelle Malkin, and then that albatross will be hung around your neck.
[00:40:01.113 --> 00:40:02.334]  What do you say to that, Jason?
[00:40:02.334 --> 00:40:03.935]  Well, it's a classic setup.
[00:40:03.935 --> 00:40:07.597]  They're trying to diffuse the situation of truth being spread among the people.
[00:40:07.597 --> 00:40:13.721]  It's the same thing as, you know, the people that are getting the media attention are dressed up like Mickey Mouse from Fantasia.
[00:40:13.721 --> 00:40:15.502]  It's to discredit dissent.
[00:40:15.502 --> 00:40:17.904]  It's to make the protesters look like fools.
[00:40:17.904 --> 00:40:23.267]  For instance, I don't know if you've seen the clip yet of the two Fox News reporters in the middle of about, I don't know,
[00:40:24.047 --> 00:40:28.308]  30 or 40 protesters and they physically get attacked.
[00:40:28.308 --> 00:40:29.648]  Yeah, they're cursing out.
[00:40:29.648 --> 00:40:30.749]  They don't have a message.
[00:40:30.749 --> 00:40:37.290]  It's just like what you and Tom Martino discussed yesterday on his radio show that these guys are total phonies.
[00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:39.210]  They have no idea why they're out there.
[00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:45.452]  I mean, you can't just sit there and start saying, you know, take from the rich and give to the poor.
[00:40:45.452 --> 00:40:46.692]  I mean, you've got to have a message.
[00:40:46.692 --> 00:40:47.172]  You have to say,
[00:40:47.692 --> 00:40:48.853]  This is why we're here.
[00:40:48.853 --> 00:40:49.753]  This is how we can win.
[00:40:49.753 --> 00:40:51.174]  These guys are dressed like clowns.
[00:40:51.174 --> 00:40:52.275]  They're dressed like anarchists.
[00:40:52.275 --> 00:40:53.476]  They're trying to incite violence.
[00:40:53.476 --> 00:40:56.638]  They're trying to... Going back to the Malkin situation.
[00:40:56.638 --> 00:41:02.161]  Then, once it's proven that I didn't say kill Michelle Malkin, I was on John Gibson's radio show yesterday.
[00:41:02.161 --> 00:41:03.902]  Malkin was on before me.
[00:41:03.902 --> 00:41:06.564]  And he says, well, so what if they were with her?
[00:41:06.564 --> 00:41:07.845]  You influenced them.
[00:41:07.845 --> 00:41:11.687]  You mind-controlled her people to say kill Malkin.
[00:41:11.687 --> 00:41:13.609]  So he's saying it isn't a setup.
[00:41:13.609 --> 00:41:15.550]  He's saying I mind-controlled them.
[00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:21.632]  Uh, like the Emperor from Star Wars to start screaming, kill Michelle Malkin.
[00:41:21.632 --> 00:41:26.915]  So, they've been caught red-handed, so then they fall back on, well, you were yelling and screaming at her.
[00:41:26.915 --> 00:41:31.157]  Only after her bodyguard bumped into me, pushed on me, and I did push him back.
[00:41:31.157 --> 00:41:33.698]  They love to clip that out and just put that on the web.
[00:41:33.698 --> 00:41:35.198]  We've got all this on tape.
[00:41:35.198 --> 00:41:37.760]  Everybody trying to discredit us, you're gonna be discredited.
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:38.620]  We have all the proof.
[00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:40.641]  Listen, I want you to move the chemtrail lady back 30 minutes.
[00:41:41.321 --> 00:41:51.969]  I want you to cover it for the rest of this hour and 30 minutes of the next hour playing the select clips of the MSNBC Hardball Chris Matthews playing the Michelle Malkin Fox News clips.
[00:41:51.969 --> 00:41:55.712]  And I've got you on Russia TV as well, so we've got quite a few clips from yesterday.
[00:41:55.712 --> 00:41:59.114]  I mean, you are really kicking some major butt down at the DNC right now.
[00:41:59.114 --> 00:42:02.097]  Well, we've got Extra coming over here right now.
[00:42:02.097 --> 00:42:08.281]  We've got a bunch of other TV networks calling us, but it looks like these are hit pieces.
[00:42:08.281 --> 00:42:10.183]  It looks like that we are really
[00:42:10.803 --> 00:42:11.983]  Really under attack here.
[00:42:11.983 --> 00:42:15.724]  They've been waiting for their chance to go after me in the national media.
[00:42:15.724 --> 00:42:18.145]  And it looks like this is their attack pattern right now, folks.
[00:42:18.145 --> 00:42:21.865]  But I think it's going to blow up in their face because of the new information.
[00:42:21.865 --> 00:42:22.966]  But I need Curt Nemo.
[00:42:22.966 --> 00:42:23.806]  I need Paul Watson.
[00:42:23.806 --> 00:42:24.646]  I need Steve Watson.
[00:42:24.646 --> 00:42:34.108]  I need you full-time blogging after the show to analyze every facet and create a master, you know, set Alex Jones and 9-11 truth up.
[00:42:34.963 --> 00:42:36.064]  I don't know.
[00:42:51.537 --> 00:42:52.178]  This is big.
[00:42:52.178 --> 00:42:54.079]  I mean, we have them.
[00:42:54.079 --> 00:43:00.163]  And then we have the national media engaged in a hoax against myself and the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[00:43:00.163 --> 00:43:01.043]  But we're not going to stop.
[00:43:01.043 --> 00:43:03.645]  We're going to go to more live TV events today.
[00:43:03.645 --> 00:43:07.868]  We're going to go cover Rage Against the Machine in the next two hours down at the Park Civic Center.
[00:43:08.608 --> 00:43:11.751]  We are going to be doing other live radio interviews.
[00:43:11.751 --> 00:43:19.999]  We are going to be throwing it into absolute high gear here in Omaha City with continual coverage at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:43:19.999 --> 00:43:28.007]  We'll also be going live again later today on this evening on our JustinTV channel that's linked up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:43:28.007 --> 00:43:31.350]  We are on the front lines of the InfoWars, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:32.431]  Alex Jones, over and out.
[00:43:33.291 --> 00:43:35.632]  All right, thank you very much, Alex, and God bless.
[00:43:35.632 --> 00:43:45.897]  All right, let's cue up that Malkin clip right now and play that before we go out in the next segment, and then we're going to push Rosalind Peterson back to 1230 so we can cover more of this.
[00:43:45.897 --> 00:43:56.423]  I'll say this, I'll take callers for Rosalind Peterson, so if you're going to call on topic, because she was a huge guest, and we're only going to be able to have her on for a half an hour, let's take your calls on topic for that.
[00:43:56.423 --> 00:43:58.704]  So if you want to talk to her, you might want to call in a little early.
[00:43:58.704 --> 00:43:59.744]  She'll be on in less than an hour.
[00:43:59.744 --> 00:44:00.685]  All right, let's cue up Malkin.
[00:44:03.118 --> 00:44:05.319]  All right, welcome back, 16 minutes after the top of the hour.
[00:44:05.319 --> 00:44:11.501]  Fox News contributor Griff Jenkins wasn't the only one in Denver targeted by protesters at this week's Democratic National Convention.
[00:44:11.501 --> 00:44:12.841]  Remember, he was swarmed.
[00:44:12.841 --> 00:44:23.465]  Look at what conservative blogger Michelle Malkin had to deal with as she sought to cover an attempt by anti-war protesters there to levitate the Denver Mint.
[00:44:26.841 --> 00:44:30.144]  Michelle Malkin called for putting Americans in camps.
[00:44:30.144 --> 00:44:31.646]  She's right over there.
[00:44:31.646 --> 00:44:32.887]  Where is she?
[00:44:32.887 --> 00:44:33.267]  Right there!
[00:44:33.267 --> 00:44:35.109]  Michelle Malkin, Fox News!
[00:44:35.109 --> 00:44:38.392]  Michelle Malkin, Fox News has just put Americans in camps!
[00:44:38.392 --> 00:44:39.953]  She wrote a book called... What's she wearing?
[00:44:39.953 --> 00:44:40.554]  Where is she?
[00:44:44.257 --> 00:44:46.478]  And Michelle Malkin joins us right now.
[00:44:46.478 --> 00:44:48.959]  Who's that guy with a set of lungs on him?
[00:44:48.959 --> 00:44:51.239]  He's the leader of the 9-11 truce movement.
[00:44:51.239 --> 00:44:56.301]  These are people who think that the government killed Americans and it was a big conspiracy.
[00:44:56.301 --> 00:45:05.103]  This guy's a French talk show host and he showed up at what was supposed to be a peaceful event, Steve, to levitate the Denver Mint.
[00:45:05.103 --> 00:45:06.604]  I know, I heard.
[00:45:06.604 --> 00:45:08.544]  There were a lot of really crazy people over there.
[00:45:08.544 --> 00:45:10.285]  There was a guy dressed like Merlin.
[00:45:11.565 --> 00:45:14.287]  Yeah, you had Harry Potter impersonators.
[00:45:14.287 --> 00:45:21.171]  Actually, you know, they were there to try and channel the spirit of Adam Hoffman, who did this in the late 60s at the Pentagon.
[00:45:21.171 --> 00:45:29.357]  But it turned ugly, and for the most part, these protests have been, you know, fairly staid.
[00:45:29.357 --> 00:45:37.102]  And, you know, the headline out of this, and I wrote a column about it today, is that for the most part, Recreate 68 has been an abysmal failure.
[00:45:37.102 --> 00:45:38.143]  Let me get this straight.
[00:45:38.143 --> 00:45:41.325]  So, they want to have freedom of speech, but you can't have it.
[00:45:41.545 --> 00:45:42.065]  Right.
[00:45:42.065 --> 00:45:48.310]  While this guy is screaming that I'm a monster and an enemy of free speech, you just have to laugh at it.
[00:45:48.310 --> 00:45:55.615]  I think that's one of the instructive things, is just what a self-mockery these people have made of themselves.
[00:45:55.615 --> 00:46:04.401]  And this particular event, which I was there to cover as a blogger, turned out to be a failure, and so opportunists seized the day and tried to make
[00:46:05.041 --> 00:46:13.347]  Yeah, they promised 50,000 people, and the police have done a good job of maintaining order, but in this particular case the other day when this happened, they sort of just had a hands-off attitude.
[00:46:13.347 --> 00:46:16.189]  Real briefly, as you've walked around the DNC, have you had a nice reception?
[00:46:30.745 --> 00:46:33.726]  Well, there was that warm embrace.
[00:46:33.726 --> 00:46:34.047]  That guy?
[00:46:34.047 --> 00:46:37.948]  But for the most part, sure, from the business people, yes.
[00:46:37.948 --> 00:46:38.629]  Alright, very good.
[00:46:38.629 --> 00:46:39.789]  Michelle, always a pleasure.
[00:46:39.789 --> 00:46:42.411]  Her websites are... Thank you very much.
[00:46:42.411 --> 00:46:44.211]  Peter Ducey is going to be joining us in about 20 minutes.
[00:46:44.211 --> 00:46:48.633]  Is anyone else sick to their stomach after hearing that little vulture talk?
[00:46:48.633 --> 00:46:57.438]  First of all, please don't associate me and my group with somebody who dressed up like Mickey Mouse to levitate the mint, okay?
[00:46:57.438 --> 00:47:00.079]  Those people are insane morons.
[00:47:00.828 --> 00:47:01.888]  That's what they are.
[00:47:01.888 --> 00:47:03.709]  And we're not on the fringe, Michelle.
[00:47:03.709 --> 00:47:05.670]  Unfortunately, you're on the freak fringe.
[00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:11.272]  Do you understand that Congress has less than a 15% approval rating?
[00:47:11.272 --> 00:47:17.215]  That you lie about it when our Marines kill animals on tape and people, by the way.
[00:47:17.215 --> 00:47:17.915]  Indiscriminately.
[00:47:17.915 --> 00:47:18.455]  Yeah, it happens.
[00:47:18.455 --> 00:47:19.335]  I'm sorry, folks.
[00:47:19.335 --> 00:47:21.356]  I'm not gonna sugarcoat it for you.
[00:47:21.356 --> 00:47:21.876]  Alright?
[00:47:21.876 --> 00:47:27.739]  A lot of our troops over there are totally mentally gone and they are killing innocent people.
[00:47:27.739 --> 00:47:28.699]  Let's get them out of there.
[00:47:28.699 --> 00:47:30.500]  Let's get them out of this crazy situation.
[00:47:31.129 --> 00:47:33.571]  It's unbelievable to me.
[00:47:33.571 --> 00:47:34.451]  I want to freak out.
[00:47:34.451 --> 00:47:36.052]  I totally want to freak out.
[00:47:36.052 --> 00:47:39.895]  We still got a couple minutes before the break, so why don't we queue up some of that Matthews?
[00:47:39.895 --> 00:47:41.016]  Can we queue up some of that Matthews?
[00:47:41.016 --> 00:47:45.019]  Let's do it.
[00:47:45.019 --> 00:47:49.542]  And then we just heard that Hardball was going live about five blocks away.
[00:47:49.542 --> 00:47:51.823]  We rushed over there, took it over.
[00:47:51.823 --> 00:47:52.924]  We are change.
[00:47:52.924 --> 00:47:54.545]  InfoWars.com, folks.
[00:47:54.545 --> 00:47:55.125]  Took it over.
[00:47:55.125 --> 00:47:57.147]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:47:57.147 --> 00:47:57.807]  Incredible.
[00:47:59.918 --> 00:48:01.019]  Louder than Chris Matthews.
[00:48:01.019 --> 00:48:02.200]  It's Infowars.com.
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:03.261]  Infowars.com.
[00:48:03.261 --> 00:48:04.662]  9-11's an inside job.
[00:48:04.662 --> 00:48:06.643]  9-11's an inside job.
[00:48:06.643 --> 00:48:08.125]  And they did the same thing they did in New York.
[00:48:08.125 --> 00:48:13.529]  Of course, here we are on the second night of the Democratic National Convention.
[00:48:17.827 --> 00:48:18.467]  You can tell.
[00:48:18.467 --> 00:48:19.908]  We've got bullhorns and everything.
[00:48:19.908 --> 00:48:27.930]  We're going to try to ignore some of the crazier elements and hear from the people that are here to cover the convention and are paying attention to it.
[00:48:27.930 --> 00:48:36.932]  Right now we've got Jennifer Palmieri, former John Edwards advisor, and one of the most powerful men in California, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa.
[00:48:36.932 --> 00:48:38.172]  How are you?
[00:48:38.172 --> 00:48:39.213]  Thank you, sir.
[00:48:39.213 --> 00:48:41.493]  We've just had some fun together.
[00:48:41.493 --> 00:48:44.094]  You know, I guess it's the old question of,
[00:48:44.754 --> 00:48:47.176]  The character is thick.
[00:48:47.176 --> 00:48:50.299]  Last night, I never saw so much character.
[00:48:50.299 --> 00:48:51.800]  The charm of Michelle Obama.
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:55.343]  She was downright fetching as a family member, as a mother.
[00:48:55.343 --> 00:48:56.824]  The children were divine.
[00:48:56.824 --> 00:48:58.846]  The father was fatherly.
[00:48:58.846 --> 00:49:03.109]  It was father knows best, or rather, it was the Huxtables.
[00:49:03.109 --> 00:49:06.672]  Also, there was a great sentimental moment with Senator Candy.
[00:49:06.932 --> 00:49:07.473]  Let's cut it.
[00:49:07.473 --> 00:49:08.233]  Let's cut the clip.
[00:49:08.233 --> 00:49:09.434]  Alright, you get the idea.
[00:49:09.434 --> 00:49:11.616]  And he did this for quite some time.
[00:49:11.616 --> 00:49:12.957]  Infowars.com.
[00:49:12.957 --> 00:49:16.861]  I think that's really the only time that Chris Matthews even addressed them.
[00:49:16.861 --> 00:49:18.142]  It was pretty wild.
[00:49:18.142 --> 00:49:20.283]  Obviously, you can't even hear what they're talking about.
[00:49:20.283 --> 00:49:21.925]  Michelle Obama, this.
[00:49:21.925 --> 00:49:23.886]  All a bunch of left-right garbage.
[00:49:23.886 --> 00:49:34.996]  You know, I watched a little bit inside the DNC yesterday on the mainline networks and it was just gross, disgusting, revolting to see all these little lemmings like
[00:49:36.830 --> 00:49:40.893]  The Democrats are going to say that we're going to get out of the war!
[00:49:40.893 --> 00:49:42.374]  No, they're not!
[00:49:42.374 --> 00:49:47.479]  Like, you didn't realize the Democrats were not getting you out of the war two years ago when you voted them in?
[00:49:47.479 --> 00:49:48.380]  And nothing happened?
[00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:50.602]  And Pelosi said impeachment was off the table?
[00:49:50.602 --> 00:49:55.065]  Pelosi was part of the initial congressional investigation into 9-11.
[00:49:55.065 --> 00:49:56.246]  She's the problem.
[00:49:56.246 --> 00:49:58.608]  She's openly New World Order.
[00:49:58.608 --> 00:50:03.713]  When she was named Speaker of the House, she talked about Novus Ordo Seclorum on the back of the dollar bill.
[00:50:04.696 --> 00:50:09.397]  And how it was, uh, you know, she brings the Founding Fathers into it and blah blah blah blah.
[00:50:09.397 --> 00:50:10.618]  And then she did it again.
[00:50:10.618 --> 00:50:12.078]  She's New World Order.
[00:50:12.078 --> 00:50:13.379]  Okay?
[00:50:13.379 --> 00:50:16.280]  It's not just a wrestling tag team group, folks.
[00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:17.740]  It's the real deal.
[00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:18.840]  It's what all this is about.
[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:21.701]  It's about globalism.
[00:50:21.701 --> 00:50:24.802]  And that's why I really hope that Paul Greg Roberts is wrong.
[00:50:24.802 --> 00:50:27.123]  Because, uh, personally, I don't want to be blown up.
[00:50:27.123 --> 00:50:29.384]  I don't know about you.
[00:50:29.384 --> 00:50:33.825]  And, uh, if you missed that first, uh, segment interview, it'll be in the refeed.
[00:50:36.747 --> 00:50:38.708]  He's right, we're all going to that spirit in the sky.
[00:50:38.708 --> 00:50:39.508]  Not most of us, though.
[00:50:39.508 --> 00:50:42.329]  Because we're all too greedy.
[00:50:42.329 --> 00:50:44.050]  Too self-absorbed.
[00:50:44.050 --> 00:50:44.990]  Too apathetic.
[00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:46.171]  We don't really care what's going on.
[00:50:46.171 --> 00:50:48.672]  Alright, we're going to come back.
[00:50:48.672 --> 00:50:52.754]  We're going to play Alex on Russia TV today.
[00:50:52.754 --> 00:50:54.214]  And a bunch more from the DNC.
[00:50:54.214 --> 00:50:57.696]  Remember, he's streaming live over at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:51:00.985 --> 00:51:05.191]  Do you have doubts about the stability of the dollar or your own financial future?
[00:51:05.191 --> 00:51:10.178]  Is a dismal growth rate or rapid inflation affecting the bottom line of your retirement savings account?
[00:51:10.178 --> 00:51:15.525]  Do you worry about uncontrollable economic events which could suddenly wipe out some or all of your hard-earned savings?
[00:51:15.525 --> 00:51:17.448]  You can turn adversity into opportunity.
[00:51:17.608 --> 00:51:26.095]  Individual retirement accounts and most 401Ks, 403Bs, SEPs and other retirement plans can be rolled over into self-directed accounts using gold and silver.
[00:51:26.095 --> 00:51:31.079]  There are definitely some do's and don'ts with this rollover process and that's where Midas Resources comes in.
[00:51:31.079 --> 00:51:37.284]  Call us at 1-866-323-5665 and we can help you with this process.
[00:51:37.284 --> 00:51:42.748]  History has shown that metals will maintain your buying power even if other financial assets are failing.
[00:51:42.748 --> 00:51:47.192]  It's not a question of if you'll need precious metals in your portfolio, it's a question of when.
[00:51:47.672 --> 00:51:52.974]  So whether you're planning for an economic rainy day or a Category 5 hurricane, the solution is the same.
[00:51:52.974 --> 00:51:56.095]  Call us today at 1-866-323-5665.
[00:51:56.095 --> 00:51:58.696]  1-866-323-5665.
[00:51:58.696 --> 00:52:07.579]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:52:07.579 --> 00:52:09.240]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:11.741]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:11.741 --> 00:52:12.542]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:12.542 --> 00:52:13.563]  This is his M.O.
[00:52:13.563 --> 00:52:14.904]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:14.904 --> 00:52:16.906]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:16.906 --> 00:52:24.052]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:24.052 --> 00:52:24.532]  Some U.S.
[00:52:24.532 --> 00:52:30.897]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:30.897 --> 00:52:34.340]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:44.865]  In Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:52:44.865 --> 00:52:46.086]  Fabled enemies.

[00:53:00.649 --> 00:53:02.409]  Honey, have you seen the remote?
[00:53:02.409 --> 00:53:04.630]  Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?
[00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:06.410]  I can't find my wallet!
[00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:07.250]  Sound familiar?
[00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:10.711]  Why not save time looking for lost things and lose the stress instead?

[00:54:21.167 --> 00:54:23.828]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[00:54:23.828 --> 00:54:26.650]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[00:54:29.573 --> 00:54:40.478]  Alright.
[00:54:40.478 --> 00:54:41.859]  We're back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:41.859 --> 00:54:43.259]  I'm Jason Burmiss.
[00:54:43.259 --> 00:54:45.821]  A couple religious tunes on the way in and out.
[00:54:45.821 --> 00:54:47.561]  You better believe it, man.
[00:54:47.561 --> 00:54:49.002]  I believe we have a soul.
[00:54:49.002 --> 00:54:51.103]  I believe there's good and evil.
[00:54:51.103 --> 00:54:58.066]  And, uh, you know, you ain't good if you go down to the DNC and start pushing around Fox News reporters and just cursing.
[00:54:58.741 --> 00:55:01.022]  And have no message whatsoever.
[00:55:01.022 --> 00:55:02.442]  Like the guy's going, do you have a message?
[00:55:02.442 --> 00:55:02.922]  Do you have a message?
[00:55:02.922 --> 00:55:26.809]  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[00:55:28.999 --> 00:55:32.040]  While the shooting may be over, the war of words continues.
[00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:36.742]  Russia has criticized the Western media for what it has called its biased view on the conflict.
[00:55:36.742 --> 00:55:40.323]  But not all journalists blame Russia for the conflict.
[00:55:40.323 --> 00:55:46.765]  Alex Jones from the Infowars.com website claims American viewers have been deceived by the coverage.
[00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:51.603]  First off, let me say I am ashamed as an American.
[00:55:51.603 --> 00:56:06.493]  I'm a loyal American who loves my country, but my country has been taken over by a private international military-industrial complex, and they launched a sneak attack on the Russian enclaves of Abkhazia and other areas, as you know, on 888.
[00:56:07.874 --> 00:56:15.837]  Using the cover of the Olympic Games and a dastardly sneak attack on the Order of Pearl Harbor in World War II.
[00:56:15.837 --> 00:56:20.139]  And I'm just so ashamed that our country's been hijacked and is being used to do this.
[00:56:20.139 --> 00:56:32.504]  I was watching foreign news and I knew that the U.S.-backed Georgians, the Israeli and NATO-backed Georgians had snuck attacked viciously and were hunting down and killing civilians, attacking the peacekeepers.
[00:56:32.504 --> 00:56:36.145]  Just unprecedented crimes in our modern age, in the 21st century.
[00:56:36.765 --> 00:56:47.435]  And then I would turn on CNN and Fox and even BBC and they were reporting that Russia, it was headlines, Russia invades Georgia, Russia sneak attacks.
[00:56:47.435 --> 00:56:51.698]  And our leaders went on television and said that we would have to have a new Cold War.
[00:56:51.698 --> 00:56:54.561]  It was such an insult to the American people's intelligence.
[00:56:55.642 --> 00:56:58.046]  That the United States backed Georgia.
[00:56:58.046 --> 00:57:02.232]  And I apologize as an American that we want our government to be taken over like this.
[00:57:02.232 --> 00:57:05.256]  This is not the United States that I grew up in.
[00:57:05.256 --> 00:57:09.022]  The neocons in NATO, in the US and Israel.
[00:57:10.143 --> 00:57:11.965]  Want to have a new Cold War.
[00:57:11.965 --> 00:57:25.536]  I just hope Russia keeps troops in Georgia so no more sneak attacks can be launched because the dictator, and we know he was elected under fraud there in Georgia, has said that he plans, he said it last week, to attack again
[00:57:26.076 --> 00:57:26.956]  As soon as he can.
[00:57:26.956 --> 00:57:31.657]  So please, Russia does not need to leave these areas that have been part of Russia for years.
[00:57:31.657 --> 00:57:33.377]  Abkhazia and Ossetia.
[00:57:33.377 --> 00:57:34.678]  Because we don't want violence.
[00:57:34.678 --> 00:57:36.298]  The American people don't want this.
[00:57:36.298 --> 00:57:37.698]  We want to be friends with Russia.
[00:57:37.698 --> 00:57:44.919]  The Anglo-American Western New World Order system based in, of course, London and New York and D.C.
[00:57:44.919 --> 00:57:46.300]  They have hijacked the U.S.
[00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:48.380]  They have implemented continuity of government.
[00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:49.740]  They have geared up for martial law.
[00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:53.321]  Alex Jones telling it like it is over on Russian television, folks.
[00:57:53.321 --> 00:57:53.821]  There he is.
[00:57:55.071 --> 00:57:57.612]  A bastion of freedom and free speech.
[00:57:57.612 --> 00:57:59.473]  I love Alex, man.
[00:57:59.473 --> 00:58:14.519]  You know, I've seen a ton of positive commentaries on some of the message boards about what he's been doing in the DNC, but there are always those backbiters, those haters, you know, those people that are raging with jealousy or just insanity, in my opinion.
[00:58:14.519 --> 00:58:16.340]  Alex is getting a ton of news coverage.
[00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:18.081]  9-11 Truth is getting a ton of news coverage.
[00:58:18.081 --> 00:58:20.562]  You know, he's making the international media.
[00:58:21.582 --> 00:58:23.422]  Provocateurs are trying to set him up.
[00:58:23.422 --> 00:58:24.423]  Of course he's being effective.
[00:58:24.423 --> 00:58:27.723]  He's the most effective thing out there.
[00:58:27.723 --> 00:58:28.803]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:28.803 --> 00:58:30.364]  You're at the tip of the Infowar.
[00:58:30.364 --> 00:58:31.684]  Here it is.
[00:58:31.684 --> 00:58:42.286]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and of course, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:42.286 --> 00:58:43.686]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:43.686 --> 00:58:46.447]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:51.278 --> 00:58:56.999]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:58:56.999 --> 00:58:58.320]  And we knew what to do.
[00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:00.320]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:07.362]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:59:07.362 --> 00:59:12.503]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement.
[00:59:13.496 --> 00:59:16.259]  That the air was safe to breathe.
[00:59:16.259 --> 00:59:23.348]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:59:23.348 --> 00:59:26.532]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:59:26.532 --> 00:59:31.598]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:59:32.279 --> 00:59:35.380]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:41.421]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[00:59:41.421 --> 00:59:44.341]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:59:44.341 --> 00:59:53.563]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:59:53.563 --> 00:59:55.963]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.963 --> 00:59:58.724]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.316 --> 01:00:10.159]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.159 --> 01:00:11.720]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:12.620]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:17.483]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.483 --> 01:00:22.665]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.665 --> 01:00:28.989]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Info War has erupted in Denver, Colorado, thanks to one man, Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.110 --> 01:00:34.133]  Alex is, I mean, he's the man!
[01:00:34.133 --> 01:00:35.434]  He took on Malkin.
[01:00:35.434 --> 01:00:36.675]  Mainstream news coverage everywhere.
[01:00:36.675 --> 01:00:37.476]  They tried to set him up.
[01:00:37.476 --> 01:00:40.098]  They tried to say he tried to, he said, kill her.
[01:00:40.098 --> 01:00:41.399]  It's been discredited already.
[01:00:41.399 --> 01:00:44.122]  He's on John Gibson, who has him on often, actually.
[01:00:44.122 --> 01:00:50.147]  You know, John Gibson trying to get the ratings and trying to, you know, say that Alex is a kook and this and that.
[01:00:50.147 --> 01:00:55.612]  But he is one of the few people that will actually give him a forum to speak, as pompous as John Gibson is.
[01:00:55.612 --> 01:00:57.354]  And Michelle Malkin, we just played that clip,
[01:00:58.291 --> 01:01:06.215]  You know, she tries to equate Alex Jones and, uh, you know, the 9-11 truth movement with these people who were trying to quote-unquote levitate the mint.
[01:01:06.215 --> 01:01:07.796]  No, that's not us!
[01:01:07.796 --> 01:01:09.337]  We're in a place called reality.
[01:01:09.337 --> 01:01:14.840]  We're not going to go levitate the mint in a Fantasia outfit.
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:19.523]  Someone really... I don't even know if they need to get, you know, slapped in the mouth.
[01:01:19.523 --> 01:01:20.223]  They're grown men.
[01:01:20.223 --> 01:01:23.285]  They should... The guy looks like he's like 55, 60 years old.
[01:01:23.285 --> 01:01:24.786]  I mean, is that really gonna help that guy?
[01:01:24.786 --> 01:01:26.467]  Maybe he just needs to be put on a gurney and
[01:01:27.122 --> 01:01:31.384]  Be hospitalized for the rest of his life if he thinks, uh, he's gonna levitate the mint.
[01:01:31.384 --> 01:01:32.944]  Unbelievable.
[01:01:32.944 --> 01:01:34.725]  Oh, well, hey, you know what?
[01:01:34.725 --> 01:01:35.746]  Freedom of speech, right?
[01:01:35.746 --> 01:01:46.350]  You know, I guess you'd wanna be a moron and help set up, you know, other dissidents to make them look like morons and, you know, misguided people to look like anarchists and put on masks and try to incite violence.
[01:01:46.350 --> 01:01:54.333]  That didn't work, so... You couldn't get your thousands and thousands of people to, you know, ruin the streets, so now let's just make us all look like idiots.
[01:01:54.333 --> 01:01:56.614]  Let's try to levitate things and wear clown outfits.
[01:01:57.492 --> 01:02:00.854]  Alright, I haven't done this in the whole first hour.
[01:02:00.854 --> 01:02:03.576]  We had a riveting interview with Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:02:03.576 --> 01:02:04.737]  Very scary interview.
[01:02:04.737 --> 01:02:12.903]  There's an article up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com about his view on the Russia situation, and it is a grim view.
[01:02:12.903 --> 01:02:13.643]  I'm not gonna lie.
[01:02:13.643 --> 01:02:20.908]  I mean, he was... I've interviewed him like three or four times now, and that was about the most hardcore interview I think I've ever done on this show.
[01:02:20.908 --> 01:02:23.851]  So, that'll rebroadcast in
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:29.202]  Right now I do want to plug my new film, Fabled Enemies.
[01:02:29.202 --> 01:02:35.925]  It will be dropping on PrisonPlanet.tv August 31st, and it will be shipping out September 1st.
[01:02:35.925 --> 01:02:41.927]  Without further ado, let's play the first trailer.
[01:02:41.927 --> 01:02:50.671]  The relationship between Bin Laden and the CIA was essentially... He was one of the assets, one of the people they could turn to.
[01:02:50.671 --> 01:02:52.252]  They wanted something done, they went to Bin Laden.
[01:02:53.337 --> 01:02:56.938]  In the early 1980s, Bin Laden worked with operatives from U.S.
[01:02:56.938 --> 01:03:01.040]  intelligence, the Pakistani military, and Arab states.
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:14.345]  Is it not true that the United States government paid $300 million to the Bin Laden family for the construction of the military camps?
[01:03:14.345 --> 01:03:22.468]  At bases, though, I really think that these were more CIA assets, people that were recruited, like all of the folks I've been issuing visas to.
[01:03:23.576 --> 01:03:30.441]  Then we have that mysterious suitcase with all of the hijackers names and all of this incriminating evidence.
[01:03:30.441 --> 01:03:31.402]  Why put a Koran?
[01:03:31.402 --> 01:03:32.422]  Why put flight manuals?
[01:03:32.422 --> 01:03:36.265]  Why put all this incriminating information if it's supposedly going to get burned up?
[01:03:43.866 --> 01:03:47.691]  Let's show you some video that was taken 8 days after 9-11.
[01:03:47.691 --> 01:03:52.416]  That man there is Osama Bin Laden's younger brother, Khalil.
[01:03:52.416 --> 01:03:55.580]  That family that took off, that's a f***ing crime.
[01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:59.985]  I was surprised at the evidence that there were foreign governments involved.
[01:03:59.985 --> 01:04:03.569]  Most of that information is classified, I think overly classified.
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:10.301]  Osama bin Laden.
[01:04:10.301 --> 01:04:11.582]  Osama bin Laden.
[01:04:11.582 --> 01:04:13.024]  Osama bin Laden.
[01:04:13.024 --> 01:04:14.285]  Osama bin Laden.
[01:04:14.285 --> 01:04:15.045]  Osama bin Laden.
[01:04:15.045 --> 01:04:19.970]  Remember, 24 hours ago, it was the Bush tax cut, the Bush budget, the Bush economy.
[01:04:19.970 --> 01:04:21.811]  You don't hear any of that tonight.
[01:04:21.811 --> 01:04:23.433]  It's America's enemy.
[01:04:23.433 --> 01:04:27.696]  America's under attack.
[01:04:27.696 --> 01:04:29.177]  All right, there you have it, folks.
[01:04:29.177 --> 01:04:32.340]  My latest, my greatest, fabled enemies.
[01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:33.301]  It drops August 31st.
[01:04:33.301 --> 01:04:34.222]  I hope you support us.
[01:04:35.296 --> 01:04:36.278]  I hope you make copies.
[01:04:36.278 --> 01:04:39.362]  We're also going to be showing it down at New York City, September 10th.
[01:04:39.362 --> 01:04:42.146]  Myself and Alex Jones, live, Truth Rising, Fabled Enemies.
[01:04:42.146 --> 01:04:44.109]  We're going to be back with Rosalind Peterson.
[01:04:44.109 --> 01:04:46.052]  And remember, we want to take your calls on topic.
[01:04:46.052 --> 01:04:47.434]  It's all about chemtrails, baby.
[01:04:47.434 --> 01:04:48.676]  We'll be back after this.
[01:04:48.676 --> 01:04:50.418]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:05:02.603 --> 01:05:08.248]  Are you tired of hearing that a cure for cancer is coming, but it will be available sometime in the future?
[01:05:08.248 --> 01:05:10.890]  At LaysMedInc, the future is here.
[01:05:10.890 --> 01:05:14.553]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with our patented methodology.
[01:05:14.553 --> 01:05:25.762]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can kill skin cancer and breast tumors of any size, and many other types of cancer without adverse side effects at our outpatient facility.
[01:05:25.982 --> 01:05:26.643]  We're good to go.
[01:05:44.802 --> 01:05:51.367]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:05:51.367 --> 01:05:53.929]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:06:10.265 --> 01:06:11.827]  But who is the enemy?
[01:06:11.827 --> 01:06:12.628]  Bin Laden.
[01:06:12.628 --> 01:06:13.689]  This is his M.O.
[01:06:13.689 --> 01:06:14.990]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:06:14.990 --> 01:06:16.992]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:06:16.992 --> 01:06:24.139]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:06:24.139 --> 01:06:24.620]  Some U.S.
[01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:30.266]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:06:30.966 --> 01:06:34.469]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:06:34.469 --> 01:06:44.937]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:06:44.937 --> 01:06:46.178]  Fabled enemies.
[01:06:46.178 --> 01:06:53.924]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:06:53.924 --> 01:06:57.287]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[01:07:00.748 --> 01:07:03.070]  Keep out of reach of children under six years of age.
[01:07:03.070 --> 01:07:09.294]  If you accidentally swallow more than used for brushing, seek professional assistance or contact a poison control center immediately.
[01:07:09.294 --> 01:07:12.215]  Why would you or your family use a product with this warning?
[01:07:12.215 --> 01:07:21.621]  If you're looking for a safe and natural alternative to keep your teeth healthy, clean, and sparkling, then you need SoliSmile All Natural Tooth Powder, the first tooth powder of its kind.
[01:07:21.621 --> 01:07:29.967]  SoliSmile contains 84 mineral-rich Himalayan sea salt, baking soda, and xylitol, a sugar substitute with long-lasting dental benefits.
[01:07:30.427 --> 01:07:36.411]  Soleil Smile comes in five flavors, made from grade A essential oils, so I know it'll please even your kids.
[01:07:36.411 --> 01:07:40.254]  You'll also appreciate the convenient 2 ounce airline safe size.

[01:08:00.707 --> 01:08:06.110]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.110 --> 01:08:23.600]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.701]  Alright folks, we're back at the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:25.701 --> 01:08:27.102]  I am Jason Vermas sitting in.
[01:08:28.306 --> 01:08:37.054]  And a few months back when I was sitting in, we had a guest on named Rosalind Peterson, and she's really the foremost expert on chemtrails, in my opinion.
[01:08:37.054 --> 01:08:43.260]  And I just got a huge amount of email, I got a huge amount of MySpace messages saying how much they love the guest.
[01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:48.905]  So we're going to do one segment here with her, and then we're going to take your questions on topic for her.
[01:08:48.905 --> 01:08:49.806]  Thanks for joining us, Rosalind.
[01:08:51.004 --> 01:08:51.504]  You're welcome.
[01:08:51.504 --> 01:08:53.725]  Thank you for having me on your show.
[01:08:53.725 --> 01:08:54.446]  It's going to be great.
[01:08:54.446 --> 01:08:54.886]  I can tell.
[01:08:54.886 --> 01:08:56.026]  I mean, it was great last time.
[01:08:56.026 --> 01:09:00.989]  I don't know what the response was for you, but the response over at InfoWars was incredible.
[01:09:00.989 --> 01:09:04.831]  Why don't you give a short bio on how you got into all this?
[01:09:04.831 --> 01:09:17.977]  Well, starting in 2002, I began to realize that there was a persistent jet contrail showing up in the skies over Mendocino County in Northern California, where I live.
[01:09:19.057 --> 01:09:28.586]  And starting from that period on, I began to really become interested because my background is in agriculture.
[01:09:28.586 --> 01:09:33.311]  And I worked for the Mendocino County Department of Agriculture.
[01:09:33.311 --> 01:09:41.919]  I grew up and was born and raised on a working farm where we had fruits and vegetables and walnuts, different types of crops.
[01:09:42.879 --> 01:09:56.847]  And so then I went to work for the United States Department of Agriculture in California at the Farm Service Agency as a certified agricultural crop loss adjuster.
[01:09:56.847 --> 01:10:09.593]  So I traveled all over the state looking at crop losses and making determinations about those for a period of time where I traveled about 50,000 miles a year.
[01:10:11.553 --> 01:10:14.895]  So that was quite interesting for me.
[01:10:14.895 --> 01:10:32.943]  And then when I realized that the skies were beginning to have man-made clouds, which according to NASA is when persistent jet contrails persist, they turn into man-made clouds, and that these man-made clouds, according to NASA, were exacerbating global warming.
[01:10:32.943 --> 01:10:40.827]  And when I realized that we were on a drumbeat across the nation and around the world to do something about global warming,
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:57.087]  I was wondering why we didn't step up to the plate and stop these persistent jet contrails, because they were becoming more and more problematic in NASA studies over the past several years.
[01:10:57.087 --> 01:11:01.369]  So that basically led you to believe that these were not really there to help us.
[01:11:01.369 --> 01:11:05.291]  In other words, this wasn't really there to help humanity, but it has some ulterior motive.
[01:11:08.009 --> 01:11:10.770]  I think it's an experiment.
[01:11:10.770 --> 01:11:19.816]  In other words, in weather modification, because NASA even says that these man-made clouds change our climate.
[01:11:19.816 --> 01:11:29.562]  They will negatively impact natural resources now and in the future, according to their studies, which you can go on the NASA website and just take a look.
[01:11:29.562 --> 01:11:30.923]  The studies are there.
[01:11:30.923 --> 01:11:33.205]  I mean, they're not covering this up or anything.
[01:11:33.205 --> 01:11:34.826]  They're pretty forthright with this.
[01:11:35.643 --> 01:11:59.192]  And what I'm thinking is that when you add that these change our climate, that contrails are warming us up, they begin to keep direct sunlight from hitting the ground, which means that we're going to have a lack of vitamin D, which is critical for human health, and we're going to have a lack of photosynthesis.
[01:11:59.192 --> 01:12:01.213]  Yeah, it combats depression among other things.
[01:12:01.213 --> 01:12:01.994]  It's a vital
[01:12:03.763 --> 01:12:06.505]  Vitamin that you need, and most people don't even know that.
[01:12:06.505 --> 01:12:11.448]  They don't understand that that's why a lot of people are depressed when they live in dark regions, because they don't get enough sunlight.
[01:12:11.448 --> 01:12:26.319]  That's correct, and that's why I believe that Ricketts is on the rise, because as more and more of these man-made clouds prevent direct sunlight from hitting the earth, not only does it lower crop production from a lack of photosynthesis, but it's beginning to show up
[01:12:27.054 --> 01:12:37.937]  In more and more recent studies from Kaiser and UC Berkeley, really alarmed about the increase in rickets in children in the United States and other related diseases.
[01:12:40.044 --> 01:12:42.686]  So why don't you tell people where they can find all this information?
[01:12:42.686 --> 01:12:43.747]  What's your website?
[01:12:43.747 --> 01:12:44.888]  And what can people do?
[01:12:44.888 --> 01:12:47.730]  Because a lot of people still today tell me, oh, you're crazy.
[01:12:47.730 --> 01:12:49.851]  They're not really putting clouds up into the sky.
[01:12:49.851 --> 01:12:51.092]  I can tape it.
[01:12:51.092 --> 01:13:00.779]  And I can tape it for like two hours and show how it's a straight line, how they do crosshatch patterns, and how it basically becomes clouds over the next hour, hour and a half.
[01:13:00.779 --> 01:13:01.800]  And you see the mist.
[01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:03.121]  You can tell it's man-made.
[01:13:03.121 --> 01:13:04.082]  And I'm still crazy.
[01:13:04.082 --> 01:13:08.685]  So why don't you tell people where they can get this information and how they can spread it to others?
[01:13:09.813 --> 01:13:23.043]  Okay, my website is CaliforniaSkyWatch.com and you can email me for more documentation if you like at info at CaliforniaSkyWatch.com.
[01:13:23.043 --> 01:13:25.124]  That's all spelled out.
[01:13:25.124 --> 01:13:27.666]  And you can go to the NASA website.
[01:13:27.666 --> 01:13:30.328]  You can go to the NOAA website.
[01:13:30.328 --> 01:13:31.709]  You can go to the U.S.
[01:13:31.709 --> 01:13:32.690]  Air Force website.
[01:13:33.516 --> 01:13:35.377]  And they talk about these programs.
[01:13:35.377 --> 01:13:41.059]  I mean, a lot of them, some of them are classified, but the majority are not.
[01:13:41.059 --> 01:13:52.582]  And on my website, you can find a listing for the last five years of all the weather modification programs that are ongoing in California and across the western states.
[01:13:52.582 --> 01:13:57.264]  Homeland Security started modifying hurricanes.
[01:13:57.264 --> 01:13:59.805]  Actually, this month, the first of this month, they got the money.
[01:13:59.805 --> 01:14:00.465]  Oh, lovely.
[01:14:01.025 --> 01:14:07.590]  And they're in the business now of modifying hurricanes, and that article is online as well.
[01:14:07.590 --> 01:14:13.294]  So what happens is that if you start to look for it, you will find it.
[01:14:13.294 --> 01:14:19.399]  And people don't want their weather modified and their crops disrupted from weather modification programs.
[01:14:20.143 --> 01:14:21.544]  They need to speak up.
[01:14:21.544 --> 01:14:25.086]  Even in Southern California, there's going to be a new one.
[01:14:25.086 --> 01:14:32.992]  The City Council of Los Angeles voted to put in a new weather modification program in the San Bernardino Mountains.
[01:14:32.992 --> 01:14:46.341]  And when I raised the question about how this would impact surrounding states, and also the agricultural crop production that's in that area, and in surrounding areas, dead silence.
[01:14:47.185 --> 01:14:49.346]  Because they don't want to talk about it.
[01:14:49.346 --> 01:15:02.192]  But KTVU, John Fowler had a program that aired on July 28th that was talking about all the weather modification programs in California.
[01:15:02.899 --> 01:15:14.648]  And that private companies, private individuals, anyone can modify the weather in your state or your county without your consent, without any prior notification.
[01:15:14.648 --> 01:15:20.413]  The National Weather Service never tells you that your weather is being modified by these programs.
[01:15:20.413 --> 01:15:25.617]  And the listings are available of over 60 of them that are ongoing every year.
[01:15:25.617 --> 01:15:30.781]  And each state, each of the western states is increasing the number that they do each year.
[01:15:31.744 --> 01:15:33.705]  So the programs are there.
[01:15:33.705 --> 01:15:39.047]  I'll be happy to send you the NOAA documents, but they're up on the website so you can look at them.
[01:15:39.047 --> 01:15:40.928]  Excellent.
[01:15:40.928 --> 01:15:47.971]  But if we start to look at weather modification and know that there's no government oversight, private
[01:15:48.692 --> 01:15:51.574]  Companies, private individuals, can modify your weather.
[01:15:51.574 --> 01:15:57.619]  If they pay a company, a weather modification company, to modify your weather, they can just go do it.
[01:15:57.619 --> 01:16:02.503]  And if it disrupts your agriculture or puts you in a drought, well, so what?
[01:16:02.503 --> 01:16:05.305]  Because no one answers.
[01:16:05.305 --> 01:16:06.666]  There's no U.S.
[01:16:06.666 --> 01:16:12.651]  Congress bills that say that anyone has to get permission or notify anyone about these programs.
[01:16:13.671 --> 01:16:28.163]  Um, there are, uh, one regulation says that you have to tell NOAA, but I don't believe that the states and everyone that's, and private individuals that are doing these programs are notifying NOAA because there's a lot missing from their records.
[01:16:28.163 --> 01:16:32.186]  So, um, this is what's going on, and it's no secret.
[01:16:32.186 --> 01:16:39.993]  You can look at the, um, John Fowler program on KTVU by going in and clicking on ktvu.com.
[01:16:41.996 --> 01:16:48.145]  And then go put in John Fowler weather modification and the program will come right up.
[01:16:48.652 --> 01:17:05.916]  Do you think that we're going to see a lot more of these weather modification programs in the future, and do you think that they'll eventually be revealed to the public, or do you think that we're just in such a stupor they're probably going to be able to get away with doing whatever they like, like you said, you know, a private corporation modifying the weather wherever because there's no law against it?
[01:17:05.916 --> 01:17:13.037]  Do you think that we're just going to see that over the next 15 to 20 years, just complete denial, or do you think it's just going to be revealed, yeah, we're doing it, no big deal?
[01:17:14.091 --> 01:17:18.192]  Well, when they start, we know that they're doing it now.
[01:17:18.192 --> 01:17:26.515]  And so the problem is that agriculture, water supplies, watersheds, everything is suffering the impacts of these programs.
[01:17:26.515 --> 01:17:29.176]  And so we do know about it already.
[01:17:29.176 --> 01:17:34.018]  And if we don't say no, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson's bill
[01:17:34.654 --> 01:17:34.914]  U.S.
[01:17:34.914 --> 01:17:37.957]  Senate Bill 1807 or U.S.
[01:17:37.957 --> 01:17:41.419]  House Bill 3445 will pass this year.
[01:17:41.419 --> 01:17:46.383]  And then they're really going to add military weather modifications.
[01:17:46.383 --> 01:17:48.765]  There will be no oversight in this bill.
[01:17:48.765 --> 01:17:49.586]  You can read the bill.
[01:17:49.586 --> 01:17:51.487]  It's real simple to read.
[01:17:51.487 --> 01:17:57.252]  And you can go to GovTrack.us and just put in U.S.
[01:17:57.252 --> 01:17:58.433]  Senate number 1807.
[01:17:58.433 --> 01:17:59.974]  It will come right up.
[01:18:00.991 --> 01:18:02.992]  And then there's U.S.
[01:18:02.992 --> 01:18:08.393]  Senate Bill 3036, which is Senator Barbara Boxer's Climate Security Act.
[01:18:08.393 --> 01:18:10.374]  But it's not a climate security act.
[01:18:10.374 --> 01:18:18.796]  It's got weather modification in that bill, and weather mitigation in that bill, and no public oversight.
[01:18:18.796 --> 01:18:20.957]  No congressional oversight.
[01:18:20.957 --> 01:18:24.038]  And anyone that wants to start experimenting can go right ahead.
[01:18:24.947 --> 01:18:27.628]  So, Senator Lieberman's bill, U.S.
[01:18:27.628 --> 01:18:39.114]  Senate Bill 2191, they only need five votes to pass them, and that legislation will be damaging to us, because it's even going to gut the Clean Water Act.
[01:18:40.376 --> 01:18:41.457]  Oh my God!
[01:18:41.457 --> 01:18:44.059]  And the EPA, and so those bills.
[01:18:44.059 --> 01:18:45.680]  So you can call.
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:48.483]  You can look them up on GovTrack.us.
[01:18:48.483 --> 01:18:57.710]  You can even type in weather modification and come up with about a hundred bills that all have weather modification or mitigation within the text of the bill.
[01:18:57.710 --> 01:19:02.334]  So there's a lot of interest, but there's no interest in public oversight.
[01:19:02.334 --> 01:19:03.695]  There's no interest in
[01:19:04.509 --> 01:19:04.730]  Okay.
[01:19:04.730 --> 01:19:05.631]  Thank you.
[01:19:21.088 --> 01:19:25.569]  And, or, some other place that's nearby will wind up in drought.
[01:19:25.569 --> 01:19:29.251]  So, who's going to own your weather and who's going to own your water?
[01:19:29.251 --> 01:19:31.651]  Yeah, it feels like they can cut out their competition if they'd like.
[01:19:31.651 --> 01:19:34.972]  You know, they could just say, you know what, these guys have farms, let's flood their crops.
[01:19:34.972 --> 01:19:37.753]  I don't want to have to compete with these guys.
[01:19:37.753 --> 01:19:38.854]  That's very, very scary.
[01:19:38.854 --> 01:19:43.215]  And we're going to be taking calls for Rosalind Peterson in the next segment.
[01:19:43.215 --> 01:19:45.336]  She's a real expert on weather modification, folks.
[01:19:45.336 --> 01:19:48.877]  You can go to InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, link to her website.
[01:19:48.877 --> 01:19:49.637]  We'll be back after this.
[01:20:01.308 --> 01:20:02.729]  It is a big idea.
[01:20:02.729 --> 01:20:05.552]  A new world order.
[01:20:05.552 --> 01:20:10.456]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:20:10.456 --> 01:20:13.278]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:20:13.278 --> 01:20:16.061]  Wouldn't their objective be world domination?
[01:20:16.061 --> 01:20:18.483]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:20:19.237 --> 01:20:26.576]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:20:29.577 --> 01:20:35.040]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:38.902]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:20:38.902 --> 01:20:41.463]  Dillberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:20:41.463 --> 01:20:42.643]  Most people have no idea.
[01:20:42.643 --> 01:20:43.424]  They're not after money.
[01:20:43.424 --> 01:20:44.684]  They have all the money they need.
[01:20:44.684 --> 01:20:45.665]  They're after power.
[01:20:45.665 --> 01:20:46.825]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[01:20:46.825 --> 01:20:51.588]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[01:20:51.588 --> 01:20:55.490]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:20:55.490 --> 01:20:56.310]  Endgame.
[01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:57.811]  Blueprint for global enslaving.
[01:20:58.331 --> 01:21:01.114]  You have been warned.
[01:21:01.114 --> 01:21:04.997]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[01:21:04.997 --> 01:21:06.399]  dollar has been devaluating.
[01:21:06.399 --> 01:21:10.282]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[01:21:10.282 --> 01:21:13.205]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[01:21:13.205 --> 01:21:15.267]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[01:21:15.267 --> 01:21:17.569]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[01:21:18.610 --> 01:21:29.497]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[01:21:29.497 --> 01:21:33.120]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:36.402]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[01:21:36.402 --> 01:21:38.944]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[01:21:38.944 --> 01:21:41.625]  Get all your questions answered before your money is worth zero.
[01:21:41.625 --> 01:21:41.906]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:48.650 --> 01:21:54.438]  Take action today while we still accept paper dollars for gold.
[01:21:54.438 --> 01:21:54.999]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 169
[01:22:03.131 --> 01:22:04.552]  Bring them to justice.
[01:22:04.552 --> 01:22:09.596]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[01:22:09.596 --> 01:22:15.039]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[01:22:15.039 --> 01:22:26.067]  Though the people of the U.S., where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reigning them in and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[01:22:26.067 --> 01:22:30.450]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[01:22:30.450 --> 01:22:32.912]  They oppose everything that is God and Truth,
[01:22:33.212 --> 01:22:33.773]  We're good to go.
[01:22:59.851 --> 01:23:02.815]  Every week, thousands of violent crimes are committed.
[01:23:02.815 --> 01:23:04.958]  Don't let yourself become a statistic.
[01:23:04.958 --> 01:23:05.819]  Be smart.
[01:23:05.819 --> 01:23:06.600]  Be safe.
[01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:08.923]  Trust Pepper Spray instead of your luck.

[01:24:13.141 --> 01:24:13.723]  Hold on, man.
[01:24:29.191 --> 01:24:32.573]  Alright folks, we're back at the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:32.573 --> 01:24:38.475]  And as promised, I'm going to take your calls on topic for Rosalind Peterson, an expert on weather modification.
[01:24:38.475 --> 01:24:42.477]  She's really just done a bang-up job putting all this information together.
[01:24:42.477 --> 01:24:55.443]  She was featured on local NBC News when it came to Comtrails, Chemtrails, whatever you like to call them, in one of the only mainstream news pieces about it, where they again said that this was happening to fight and combat global warming.
[01:24:55.803 --> 01:24:58.385]  All right, let's jump to Kevin in Canada.
[01:24:58.385 --> 01:25:01.107]  Kevin, what's on your mind?
[01:25:01.107 --> 01:25:03.289]  That's why I talk about the whole chemtrail thing.
[01:25:03.289 --> 01:25:08.452]  It's been out for a while, but there's a lot of people, like, I go in a different chat room to try and discuss it myself.
[01:25:08.452 --> 01:25:12.695]  I mean, the government's come up with all kinds of admitted documents that they've been doing this.
[01:25:12.695 --> 01:25:15.077]  But I'm not sure about the weather control thing.
[01:25:15.077 --> 01:25:21.982]  Right now, the number four or five killer, something like that, is death by respiratory disease caused by unknown illness.
[01:25:21.982 --> 01:25:24.644]  And they've basically proven most of these chemtrails are filled with barium.
[01:25:25.447 --> 01:25:26.728]  Which causes this problem.
[01:25:26.728 --> 01:25:32.491]  I think it's chromium, barium, and other heavy aluminums, isn't it, Rosalyn?
[01:25:32.491 --> 01:25:36.193]  I can't prove what the jets are releasing.
[01:25:36.193 --> 01:25:37.934]  I don't have any direct evidence.
[01:25:37.934 --> 01:25:48.680]  I do know that our water supplies are spiking in aluminum, barium, manganese, magnesium, and some other heavy metals.
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:54.703]  And I'm very much questioning now, throughout California, why we're having these spikes.
[01:25:55.849 --> 01:26:08.332]  And I do know that some atmospheric heating and testing programs are ongoing, which use barium and lithium and strontium-90 in these tests.
[01:26:08.332 --> 01:26:14.494]  And I'm concerned about the canisters that they shoot up loaded with those chemicals into the atmosphere.
[01:26:14.494 --> 01:26:17.835]  And then when our government on rockets or on the space shuttle
[01:26:18.510 --> 01:26:20.971]  Uh, puts them up and superheats them.
[01:26:20.971 --> 01:26:31.896]  We do know that there's a chemical reaction, um, when barium, strontium, lithium, um, manganese, magnesium, and those chemicals are put together.
[01:26:31.896 --> 01:26:43.541]  We do know that they create, um, these, um, uh, in other words, these chemical, um, research vehicles for us to figure out what's going on in the ionosphere.
[01:26:43.541 --> 01:26:45.662]  But these chemicals do come back down.
[01:26:46.528 --> 01:26:59.058]  And so from Alaska across the United States, we're getting a lot of these chemicals in our drinking water supplies spiking way over state and federal standards.
[01:26:59.058 --> 01:27:06.965]  Are you aware of the planes that had to change direction that were taking the Alaskan route because too many of their stewardesses and that were coming down with this illness?
[01:27:08.174 --> 01:27:09.495]  No, I'm not.
[01:27:09.495 --> 01:27:10.696]  Maybe you should email that to her.
[01:27:10.696 --> 01:27:12.958]  What's the website again, Rosalyn?
[01:27:12.958 --> 01:27:19.262]  It's CaliforniaSkyWatch.com, and if you have any evidence, please send it to me.
[01:27:19.262 --> 01:27:21.204]  I'd love to have it.
[01:27:21.204 --> 01:27:22.505]  Alright, Kevin.
[01:27:22.505 --> 01:27:23.205]  Thanks for the call, man.
[01:27:23.205 --> 01:27:25.367]  We've got to jump to the next caller.
[01:27:25.367 --> 01:27:29.410]  Wow, that's pretty crazy if those people are becoming ill, but it would make sense.
[01:27:29.410 --> 01:27:33.393]  I mean, if we have these spikes and they are putting something into the air,
[01:27:34.289 --> 01:27:39.218]  I mean, in that little NBC report, don't they, it was you that was testing the water, right?
[01:27:39.218 --> 01:27:44.988]  And the guy said that all of the compounds that would make for weather modification were found there, correct?
[01:27:46.531 --> 01:27:51.796]  Yes, and what we're looking at is not my own personal test.
[01:27:51.796 --> 01:28:05.369]  Anyone can get a CD from the California State Department of Health going back into the 1970s with every single water test that was taken in the state of California under EPA laws.
[01:28:06.232 --> 01:28:18.456]  And those tests are taken in every single drinking water source in California, whether it's a vineyard, a winery, a water district, a well, it doesn't matter.
[01:28:18.456 --> 01:28:24.538]  Anything that's used for a public drinking water source is tested and tested several times a year.
[01:28:24.538 --> 01:28:35.702]  So when I went back and I researched the data that was sent to me by the State of California Drinking Water Division, that's when I began to find these unusual spikes in our drinking water.
[01:28:36.269 --> 01:28:47.054]  And I began to try to correlate it with what I could find that was known about what was going on with atmospheric testing, and I think there is a correlation there.
[01:28:47.054 --> 01:28:55.237]  And other states are seeing the same type of spikes, so it's in their drinking water supply, so it's not just a California issue.
[01:28:55.237 --> 01:28:57.078]  Alright, let's jump to Dave in California.
[01:28:57.078 --> 01:28:58.579]  Dave, what's on your mind?
[01:28:58.579 --> 01:29:01.320]  Hi guys, and congratulations on your new film, Steve.
[01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:01.780]  Oh, thank you.
[01:29:04.196 --> 01:29:18.074]  Rosalind, I spoke to you last time that you were on the air, and I mentioned that up here in Humboldt County area, and all up into Oregon as well, we're seeing fewer and fewer insects and wildlife, and especially birds.
[01:29:18.818 --> 01:29:21.259]  At this point now, in the morning, I don't even hear a bird.
[01:29:21.259 --> 01:29:23.079]  I used to be able to hear one or two.
[01:29:23.079 --> 01:29:33.763]  I mentioned that last time, and I've also since then spoken to Alan Watt on this epic, and he said that he noticed in Ontario, Canada, that the forests are much more silent.
[01:29:33.763 --> 01:29:34.923]  Alright, hold on, Dave.
[01:29:34.923 --> 01:29:37.924]  We're going to hold you over, and we're going to get Rosalind's opinion on the other side.
[01:29:37.924 --> 01:29:41.185]  Remember, the websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:29:51.596 --> 01:29:55.517]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.517 --> 01:30:01.299]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.299 --> 01:30:08.040]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:09.721]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:30:10.695 --> 01:30:12.236]  But who is the enemy?
[01:30:12.236 --> 01:30:13.036]  Bin Laden.
[01:30:13.036 --> 01:30:13.897]  This is his M.O.
[01:30:13.897 --> 01:30:15.398]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:30:15.398 --> 01:30:17.399]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:30:17.399 --> 01:30:24.543]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:30:24.543 --> 01:30:25.023]  Some U.S.
[01:30:25.023 --> 01:30:31.367]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:30:31.367 --> 01:30:34.829]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:30:35.089 --> 01:30:45.352]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:30:45.352 --> 01:30:46.572]  Fabled enemies.
[01:30:46.572 --> 01:30:54.095]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles, at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:30:54.095 --> 01:30:57.696]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:31:01.027 --> 01:31:04.448]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[01:31:04.448 --> 01:31:06.769]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[01:31:06.769 --> 01:31:10.050]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[01:31:10.050 --> 01:31:16.933]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[01:31:16.933 --> 01:31:19.054]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[01:31:19.554 --> 01:31:22.856]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[01:31:22.856 --> 01:31:27.638]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[01:31:27.638 --> 01:31:31.580]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[01:31:31.580 --> 01:31:33.201]  Travel less, meet online.
[01:31:33.201 --> 01:31:35.862]  Go to Webex.com and try Webex free.
[01:31:35.862 --> 01:31:41.805]  Just click the radiographic and enter promo code 500 to get a free trial and a free webcam too.
[01:31:41.805 --> 01:31:45.567]  Remember that code 500 to qualify for the free webcam.
[01:31:45.567 --> 01:31:47.048]  Webex, now part of Cisco.
[01:31:47.108 --> 01:31:47.528]  I don't know.
[01:32:01.286 --> 01:32:10.214]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:32:10.214 --> 01:32:15.379]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:32:15.379 --> 01:32:26.489]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:32:26.889 --> 01:32:32.652]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:32:32.652 --> 01:32:38.915]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:32:38.915 --> 01:32:39.955]  What about you?
[01:32:39.955 --> 01:32:46.398]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.
[01:32:46.398 --> 01:32:48.719]  Call the Berkey guy and order now by calling 1-877-886-3653.
[01:32:48.719 --> 01:32:48.919]  That's 1-877-886-3653.
[01:32:54.823 --> 01:32:55.144]  We're good.
[01:33:19.879 --> 01:33:26.004]  And we'll continue to run against the wind in this info war.
[01:33:47.805 --> 01:33:51.408]  Against the disinformation, against the misinformation, against the provocateurs.
[01:33:51.408 --> 01:33:59.313]  A couple people sent me links to just these ravish attacks on Alex about his incident with Michelle Malkin at the DNC.
[01:33:59.313 --> 01:34:02.255]  We played you the clip of Malkin talking about it.
[01:34:03.107 --> 01:34:13.933]  On the news, and we'll get back to that later on in the show, we're going to have Bob Chapman on in the next hour, and then we're going to be taking your calls on any issue, open phones for the last 90 minutes or so of the program.
[01:34:13.933 --> 01:34:25.539]  But right now we're talking to Rosalynn Peterson, and we had David in California asking if she thought there was a correlation between this weather modification and the lack of wildlife in the areas.
[01:34:25.539 --> 01:34:30.681]  Yes, we're seeing bird declines around the world.
[01:34:30.681 --> 01:34:31.362]  We're seeing it
[01:34:32.705 --> 01:34:34.866]  Especially pollinators.
[01:34:34.866 --> 01:34:36.307]  Many birds are pollinators.
[01:34:36.307 --> 01:34:38.569]  We're seeing declines in them.
[01:34:38.569 --> 01:34:46.274]  We're not finding as many birds as we did in many areas in the last few years.
[01:34:46.274 --> 01:34:52.058]  In Lake County, 15,000 ducks just dropped out of the sky for no reason in one day.
[01:34:53.192 --> 01:35:01.194]  And they quickly buried them, pulled them out of the clear lake and buried them because they didn't know what else to do with them.
[01:35:01.194 --> 01:35:05.276]  And then said that all these birds dropped out of the sky in one day alive.
[01:35:05.276 --> 01:35:14.418]  And they were killed by some virus, which is absolutely impossible because viruses don't kill all at the same time with live birds just dropping out of the air.
[01:35:14.418 --> 01:35:17.019]  And this incident has occurred several times.
[01:35:18.115 --> 01:35:21.238]  We know that there's a decline and bee decline.
[01:35:21.238 --> 01:35:27.303]  If you go to my website, you'll find a lot of articles on bee decline across the United States.
[01:35:27.303 --> 01:35:36.831]  And if we don't have our bees, we aren't going to have a food supply except for four or five crops that don't need bees for pollination.
[01:35:36.831 --> 01:35:45.138]  So it's really critical that we right now determine why we're having bird deaths and bee declines.
[01:35:46.343 --> 01:35:59.993]  Even in England they just came out with an article just this month that one-third of the bees died over the last winter and half the bees are missing in some areas in California in the last year.
[01:35:59.993 --> 01:36:11.542]  So beekeepers are going out of business and that means that your food crops are not going to get the pollination they need because of declines in bumblebees and other pollinators.
[01:36:11.542 --> 01:36:12.403]  Any other questions, Dave?
[01:36:13.462 --> 01:36:14.623]  One more comment real fast.
[01:36:14.623 --> 01:36:15.163]  Sure.
[01:36:15.163 --> 01:36:19.106]  I had also spoken to Alan Watt and Dr. Nick Begich about the same thing.
[01:36:19.106 --> 01:36:23.549]  Nick Begich is up in Alaska and Alan Watt's in Ontario.
[01:36:24.085 --> 01:36:33.051]  And they both mentioned that they've seen a big decline in, particularly songbirds, but also insect population to some extent.
[01:36:33.051 --> 01:36:38.694]  Here, the insect population is almost down to zero, and it's continuing to stay that way.
[01:36:38.694 --> 01:36:44.398]  I've continued to leave my doors and windows wide open with lights burning and stuff, and rarely see a fly.
[01:36:44.398 --> 01:36:52.863]  Matter of fact, I saw the first, honest to God, the first blue bottle fly I'd seen in three years a couple days ago, and I just stood and looked at it in amazement.
[01:36:53.323 --> 01:36:55.905]  That's how crazy it's getting up here.
[01:36:55.905 --> 01:37:06.653]  So, aside from the weather modification aspect of it, there seems to be some sort of a wide-ranging poisonous effect that most people aren't noticing.
[01:37:06.653 --> 01:37:07.834]  And thank you for watching that.
[01:37:07.834 --> 01:37:09.815]  Well, it seems like it's quite toxic.
[01:37:09.815 --> 01:37:12.797]  It doesn't seem like it's positive or it's good for us.
[01:37:12.797 --> 01:37:14.538]  Now, we have a caller who disagrees.
[01:37:14.538 --> 01:37:17.741]  So, you know, you disagree on this show, you go to the front of the line.
[01:37:17.741 --> 01:37:20.243]  That's how we do things on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:37:20.243 --> 01:37:22.144]  So, Larry in Australia, go right ahead.
[01:37:24.506 --> 01:37:26.408]  Ah, good morning from Australia.
[01:37:26.408 --> 01:37:30.010]  I don't know what your time is over there, but it's a.m.
[01:37:30.010 --> 01:37:32.673]  here, about 3 a.m.
[01:37:32.673 --> 01:37:42.360]  The reason I disagree is, I believe, and I've been listening, let me say something first off, Alex, Jason, you do fantastic jobs.
[01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:49.285]  Okay, I've been listening to Alex now for about the last two years, and I listen every day.
[01:37:49.285 --> 01:37:49.566]  Okay.
[01:37:50.939 --> 01:37:56.923]  I do believe that the Kim trials are... It's all about eugenics.
[01:37:56.923 --> 01:37:57.464]  Okay?
[01:37:57.464 --> 01:37:59.685]  We all know the new world order.
[01:37:59.685 --> 01:38:01.707]  We want 80% reduction at least.
[01:38:01.707 --> 01:38:02.327]  Okay?
[01:38:02.327 --> 01:38:04.249]  I believe that.
[01:38:04.249 --> 01:38:07.771]  And then I believe that these Kim trials are all about eugenics.
[01:38:07.771 --> 01:38:11.234]  We're reducing the population by at least 80%.
[01:38:11.234 --> 01:38:13.435]  Well, so you're basically... Your point is... Hold on.
[01:38:13.435 --> 01:38:19.880]  Your point is that the weather modification that we're seeing right here is really about a eugenics program for depopulation.
[01:38:21.013 --> 01:38:21.814]  Exactly.
[01:38:21.814 --> 01:38:31.484]  I don't disagree with the retired, but I do believe that the number one priority here is your genetics.
[01:38:32.173 --> 01:38:35.674]  The new world order, that's what they want to do.
[01:38:35.674 --> 01:38:38.335]  They want to eliminate at least 80% of us.
[01:38:38.335 --> 01:38:41.076]  Alright, Larry, let's get her take on it, man.
[01:38:41.076 --> 01:38:42.477]  I appreciate the call.
[01:38:42.477 --> 01:38:48.519]  And, you know, obviously she just said that the 1500 ducks just dropped out of the sky.
[01:38:48.519 --> 01:38:50.520]  Dad, there seems to be poison effects.
[01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:52.120]  Yeah, there was in the thousands.
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:53.321]  Oh my God.
[01:38:53.321 --> 01:38:55.642]  So, is this a possibility?
[01:38:55.642 --> 01:38:56.842]  Could this be a eugenics program?
[01:38:57.788 --> 01:39:12.878]  Well, it could be, and we don't know, but the one thing that I'm saying is why don't we make all of this public and let the public decide on what they want to, you know, decide on whether they want these weather modification programs or not, whether they want these atmospheric programs.
[01:39:12.878 --> 01:39:20.743]  I think that this should be up for public debate and discussion and the public should be informed and then we can make the decision.
[01:39:20.743 --> 01:39:25.887]  I don't think that private individuals and government should make this kind of decision.
[01:39:25.887 --> 01:39:26.507]  I think we should
[01:39:27.248 --> 01:39:30.009]  And so there's the rub.
[01:39:30.009 --> 01:39:35.011]  And I think if there wasn't something wrong with it, it would be openly discussed more than it is now.
[01:39:35.011 --> 01:39:35.991]  I have to agree with you there.
[01:39:35.991 --> 01:39:37.131]  I thank you for the call there.
[01:39:37.131 --> 01:39:39.152]  See, I don't think we necessarily disagree.
[01:39:39.152 --> 01:39:45.634]  I just think that you're very, very cautious in saying what you can and cannot prove, which is, I think, a huge plus.
[01:39:45.634 --> 01:39:53.637]  And you've been able to accumulate all this data, so anybody with a brain who looks at all this stuff can see that it has a negative impact and it very well
[01:39:54.717 --> 01:39:57.139]  More than likely, is not what they're saying it is.
[01:39:57.139 --> 01:40:01.582]  I mean, we've been fear-mongered with global warming now for almost 30 years.
[01:40:01.582 --> 01:40:03.964]  I mean, it was in my schools as a kid.
[01:40:03.964 --> 01:40:10.770]  We're all gonna die, it's gonna get too hot, you know, the ocean's gonna rise, we're gonna have mass flooding, we're all bad.
[01:40:10.770 --> 01:40:21.418]  Even today, they're pushing for a carbon tax, saying that, you know, our carbon footprint is what's wrong, and you're gonna need to pay this tax based on how many cars you own, how big your house is, how much energy you use.
[01:40:21.878 --> 01:40:26.580]  So it does seem like the environmental movement has been completely and totally hijacked.
[01:40:26.580 --> 01:40:28.861]  Alright, let's go to James in Ohio.
[01:40:28.861 --> 01:40:29.722]  James, what's on your mind?
[01:40:29.722 --> 01:40:32.523]  It's a pleasure to talk to you guys.
[01:40:32.523 --> 01:40:34.104]  Thanks.
[01:40:34.104 --> 01:40:41.867]  I was wondering, if I remember correctly, didn't they do something for the Olympics in China to make it rain or something?
[01:40:41.867 --> 01:40:44.088]  Do you know anything about that, Rosalyn?
[01:40:44.088 --> 01:40:45.949]  Oh yes, there's a lot of articles.
[01:40:45.949 --> 01:40:50.591]  If you go and Google up China and weather modification, there's a lot of articles
[01:40:51.252 --> 01:40:54.113]  And they've been modifying the weather for some time.
[01:40:54.113 --> 01:40:56.254]  I've been kind of following it.
[01:40:56.254 --> 01:40:57.795]  And so, yes.
[01:40:57.795 --> 01:41:13.062]  And I remember they were saying about the haze or whatever that was hanging over the city and they felt if it rained it would help out the climate, not the climate, but just the atmosphere right in the city right there.
[01:41:13.062 --> 01:41:14.903]  Also, my next question was,
[01:41:16.275 --> 01:41:18.776]  What other countries are doing this kind of stuff?
[01:41:18.776 --> 01:41:23.217]  And is there any countries that are against it and trying to stop?
[01:41:23.217 --> 01:41:29.339]  Because, you know, like I said, if China does something, it's in the air and it's eventually going to get to us.
[01:41:29.339 --> 01:41:31.299]  I feel.
[01:41:31.299 --> 01:41:41.182]  There's... The United States weather modification companies openly admit that they're modifying the weather in over 50 countries around the world.
[01:41:41.182 --> 01:41:43.023]  That was on the Discovery Channel in 2007.
[01:41:44.901 --> 01:42:03.807]  And the other issue becomes that, um, as we modify the weather more and more, uh, we perfect it down to where it becomes the weapon of war, which is talked about, uh, the military talks about owning the weather in 2025, and they talk about that it will be one of the most powerful weapons of war.
[01:42:03.807 --> 01:42:11.009]  However, they have to experiment on, on to, to make it, um, in other words, to control the weather.
[01:42:11.587 --> 01:42:21.776]  So I think the American population and other populations around the world, especially in NATO countries, are being experimented upon to do the weather modification programs.
[01:42:21.776 --> 01:42:26.120]  And, openly, a lot of private companies are doing these programs.
[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:28.062]  Does that answer your question?
[01:42:28.062 --> 01:42:28.903]  Thanks a lot.
[01:42:28.903 --> 01:42:30.024]  Like I said, it was a pleasure.
[01:42:30.024 --> 01:42:30.905]  Alright, thank you.
[01:42:30.905 --> 01:42:33.527]  Alright, let's jump to the next caller.
[01:42:33.527 --> 01:42:35.789]  Let's go to Albert in Texas.
[01:42:35.789 --> 01:42:36.370]  Albert, you're on the air.
[01:42:37.205 --> 01:42:39.887]  Hey guys, thanks for taking my call.
[01:42:39.887 --> 01:42:41.548]  The guest is really enlightening, by the way.
[01:42:41.548 --> 01:42:45.471]  There was something she just said, right, just a while ago about Discovery Channel.
[01:42:45.471 --> 01:42:46.452]  I think there was something else.
[01:42:46.452 --> 01:42:47.813]  I'm not sure how recent it was.
[01:42:47.813 --> 01:42:52.917]  I have kind of a bad memory, but there was something about them making a man-made cloud with, like, a plane or something.
[01:42:52.917 --> 01:42:55.319]  I think it was for an experiment.
[01:42:55.319 --> 01:42:57.601]  I can't remember, but if she could talk about that, maybe.
[01:42:57.601 --> 01:42:58.742]  I don't know if she knew about it.
[01:42:58.742 --> 01:42:59.362]  It's on the show.
[01:42:59.362 --> 01:43:00.263]  I don't know what show it was.
[01:43:00.263 --> 01:43:01.284]  I think it was on Discovery.
[01:43:01.906 --> 01:43:10.493]  And then the second thing I wanted to just ask, I guess, is we are going to have the Money Masters back on, because I have some questions about Lincoln Greenbacks.
[01:43:10.493 --> 01:43:11.474]  Sure.
[01:43:11.474 --> 01:43:15.578]  He had them on last month, so it'll probably be another couple months before they get the Money Masters guys on.
[01:43:15.578 --> 01:43:22.463]  And I know that last time you were on here, Rosalynn, that you talked about that Discovery Channel special, didn't you?
[01:43:22.463 --> 01:43:25.186]  Yes, I talked about the Discovery Channel.
[01:43:25.186 --> 01:43:30.130]  They did a bait-and-switch tactic on that and made claims that some of us
[01:43:30.888 --> 01:43:36.850]  Who talk about these experimental programs, that we were some sort of believers.
[01:43:36.850 --> 01:43:42.933]  But other than that, there was some interesting information on it, because they did talk about modifying the weather.
[01:43:42.933 --> 01:43:45.974]  They talked about persistent jet contrails.
[01:43:45.974 --> 01:43:48.515]  NASA Patrick Minnis was on there.
[01:43:49.210 --> 01:44:00.937]  And what he talked about was these man-made, persistent contrails that turn into man-made clouds that can persist for hours and change the climate, modify the weather.
[01:44:00.937 --> 01:44:11.702]  And he talked about one contrail that, in other words, that they were looking at in specific that lasted, that expanded and lasted for about 26 hours.
[01:44:11.702 --> 01:44:14.344]  And they can cover 4,000 square miles, one contrail.
[01:44:16.670 --> 01:44:25.456]  So when you put up a lot, you realize that we're dimming the amount of sunlight and making man-made clouds all over the United States.
[01:44:25.456 --> 01:44:38.385]  Also, I would recommend that any listeners from Texas look up the Texas Weather Modification Program and find out if you're in a drought area produced by one of those weather modification programs.
[01:44:38.385 --> 01:44:40.446]  And they have a lot of them.
[01:44:40.446 --> 01:44:45.950]  Or if you are in an area which got too much rainfall because one of those programs went awry.
[01:44:47.233 --> 01:44:50.017]  Check out Texas Weather Modification Programs.
[01:44:50.017 --> 01:44:52.862]  You just Google it up and it comes right up.
[01:44:52.862 --> 01:44:54.465]  Alright, thanks for the call Albert.
[01:44:54.465 --> 01:45:00.074]  And before we jump to some more callers, I want to take this moment to thank our sponsor, Okola Blue.
[01:45:01.377 --> 01:45:09.161]  It's this great water system that we have here, and we got it in here I think about a month, month and a half ago.
[01:45:09.161 --> 01:45:14.944]  We took them on as a sponsor a little bit after that, but it's the best tasting water I've had, and believe it or not folks, you don't have to fill it.
[01:45:14.944 --> 01:45:16.205]  It's a water purifier.
[01:45:16.205 --> 01:45:21.588]  In other words, you're not going to get any fluoride, anything like that, but it takes the humidity out of the air.
[01:45:21.588 --> 01:45:24.369]  I think it's, you know, it pays for itself in one year.
[01:45:24.369 --> 01:45:26.530]  I know that I buy bottled water continuously now.
[01:45:26.530 --> 01:45:27.130]  I know I shouldn't.
[01:45:27.130 --> 01:45:28.131]  I know it's all poison, but
[01:45:28.812 --> 01:45:33.093]  I don't have the time to just sit there and fill and filter, so this is really good for me.
[01:45:33.093 --> 01:45:35.854]  When I go home, I'm going to get one that's really reasonable.
[01:45:35.854 --> 01:45:37.595]  Atmosphoric water generator for your home.
[01:45:37.595 --> 01:45:39.155]  It pays for itself within a year.
[01:45:39.155 --> 01:45:41.136]  Again, you're not going to get the fluoride.
[01:45:41.136 --> 01:45:47.958]  You're probably not going to get the barium, chromium, and other goodies that they've been putting in the sky either, because it filters all that stuff out.
[01:45:47.958 --> 01:45:50.759]  And it does 7.5 gallons in one day.
[01:45:50.759 --> 01:45:53.180]  So you can go to Ecoloblue.com.
[01:45:53.180 --> 01:45:57.801]  That's E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com, or you can call the toll-free number.
[01:45:58.101 --> 01:46:01.283]  At 866-585-4044.
[01:46:01.283 --> 01:46:05.226]  That's 866-585-4044.
[01:46:05.226 --> 01:46:06.687]  And it is delicious.
[01:46:06.687 --> 01:46:07.487]  And it's cold, too.
[01:46:07.487 --> 01:46:11.230]  It's kind of cool because it's not only cold, but you can have it come out hot.
[01:46:11.230 --> 01:46:14.672]  You just have these two separate buttons and you can have tea with it and all that other good stuff.
[01:46:14.672 --> 01:46:16.413]  So, acolablue.com.
[01:46:16.413 --> 01:46:18.234]  Alright, let's jump to another Texan caller.
[01:46:18.234 --> 01:46:19.915]  Let's go to Adam in Texas.
[01:46:19.915 --> 01:46:20.576]  Adam, what's on your mind?
[01:46:21.633 --> 01:46:26.878]  Hi, it's just good to hear this conversation because I've been following this.
[01:46:26.878 --> 01:46:29.480]  I spend my summers in Alaska and I usually drive.
[01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:34.544]  I've driven to Alaska and back in the spring and the fall ten times.
[01:46:34.544 --> 01:46:36.726]  I spend a lot of time in British Columbia and Alaska.
[01:46:38.568 --> 01:46:42.371]  Uh, the denial that they have up there towards the Chemtrail issue.
[01:46:42.371 --> 01:46:52.139]  I think that when you're in a beautiful place like Alaska and you have so many things to do with your spare time that you, uh, you don't bother concerning yourself with a lot of subject matters.
[01:46:52.139 --> 01:46:54.461]  That they're finally starting to have to come to grips with.
[01:46:54.461 --> 01:47:00.426]  I sat and talked to some people up in Alaska and they all, uh, 90% of them basically thought I was crazy.
[01:47:00.426 --> 01:47:01.067]  But the thing is,
[01:47:02.307 --> 01:47:03.968]  I've been following this for over 10 years.
[01:47:03.968 --> 01:47:10.352]  The very first one I ever saw with my own eyes I knew something was wrong and dove straight into it and I've been in the middle of it and I've got...
[01:47:11.081 --> 01:47:21.706]  Samples from I read Rents.com one day where they talked about these of these polymer fibers with desiccated blood cells attached to them And I couldn't believe that was true.
[01:47:21.706 --> 01:47:34.633]  I'm playing golf December 15 2005 in Fort Worth and all of a sudden I see these spider webs falling from the sky and you can't collect them with your hands because this stuff is heat sensitive so you grab these twigs and
[01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:53.393]  Uh, where it was collecting on bushes, and I collected this stuff, took it home, went and bought a microscope, and it's exactly what was on rents.com, so I mean, you know, this, this is, this should be at the front of the, this should be at the top of the heap as far as what we're talking about here, concerning our government and everything else.
[01:47:53.393 --> 01:47:58.176]  I mean, you know, the, the, I think we're coming to
[01:47:58.756 --> 01:48:04.318]  I think we're coming face-to-face with the brainwashing of the denial people are in with this subject.
[01:48:04.318 --> 01:48:08.280]  Well, there's no doubt that we are brainwashed and there is an ultra-denial.
[01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:13.261]  I'd say 95% of the population still has no idea about any of this stuff.
[01:48:13.261 --> 01:48:14.802]  What's your take on the polymers?
[01:48:14.802 --> 01:48:18.143]  And I thank you for the call, Adam.
[01:48:18.143 --> 01:48:22.885]  I don't know because I have never had any to test.
[01:48:23.869 --> 01:48:34.232]  And I know that the southern states, from Florida, Louisiana, Georgia, Texas, all of those states, Arkansas, are all having problems.
[01:48:34.232 --> 01:48:38.994]  And so, and other areas in the United States as well.
[01:48:38.994 --> 01:48:42.415]  And I haven't ever had any to test.
[01:48:42.415 --> 01:48:49.857]  And I don't advocate anyone sending me those because I don't want to, if there's a problem, I don't want to spread whatever's going on around either.
[01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:52.921]  So, I can't tell you too much about it.
[01:48:52.921 --> 01:48:55.962]  I've heard about it, but I don't know.
[01:48:55.962 --> 01:49:05.125]  But I do want to say is that everything has been put under the Chemtrail conspiracy wording.
[01:49:05.125 --> 01:49:10.587]  And what happened is I even talked just this past week to a staff member for a U.S.
[01:49:10.587 --> 01:49:19.691]  Congresswoman, and what happened was is that when I started to raise the issues about the water test, I started to raise all the issues about the document,
[01:49:20.411 --> 01:49:23.852]  He's the one that brought up the conspiracy theory.
[01:49:23.852 --> 01:49:27.734]  And in other words, it's almost dismissive.
[01:49:27.734 --> 01:49:31.495]  You know, the United States Air Force declares chemtrails a hoax.
[01:49:31.495 --> 01:49:33.676]  NASA, NOAA, government agencies.
[01:49:33.676 --> 01:49:44.860]  And what happens is our elected officials don't want to touch that word because they figure it's like they don't want to be branded in believing or thinking about a conspiracy theory.
[01:49:45.535 --> 01:49:59.823]  And so I really refuse to use it, and what I've done is I've gone in and I put the documents in front of them, I put the reports in front of them, and I hammer away that we're not talking about conspiracy theory.
[01:49:59.823 --> 01:50:07.567]  What we're talking about are real tests, real results, real studies by NASA, real weather modifications listed by NOAA.
[01:50:08.251 --> 01:50:15.413]  And you see, I drive home the issue that the tree decline, the bee decline, all of these things are real.
[01:50:15.413 --> 01:50:19.915]  The legislation on weather modification programs are real.
[01:50:19.915 --> 01:50:27.817]  So I hammer away at this, and this is where I'm starting, and people that are doing this, too, are starting to make inroads on this subject.
[01:50:27.817 --> 01:50:33.599]  And those that just talk about chemtrails and loop everything into a belief system, it doesn't work well.
[01:50:34.620 --> 01:50:36.262]  I agree, and I love your approach.
[01:50:36.262 --> 01:50:38.524]  You know, you are showing them the documents, you're breaking it down.
[01:50:38.524 --> 01:50:40.927]  It's CaliforniaSkyWatch.com.
[01:50:40.927 --> 01:50:45.832]  Final segment with Rosalind Peterson on the other side, and we're going to finish up with your phone calls.
[01:50:45.832 --> 01:50:48.094]  We've got TJ Scott and others holding.
[01:50:48.094 --> 01:50:49.035]  We'll get to them after this.
[01:50:49.035 --> 01:50:51.398]  It's InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:51:01.281 --> 01:51:07.223]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[01:51:07.223 --> 01:51:12.024]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[01:51:12.024 --> 01:51:17.446]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[01:51:17.446 --> 01:51:20.867]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[01:51:21.367 --> 01:51:29.872]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[01:51:29.872 --> 01:51:35.675]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[01:51:35.675 --> 01:51:41.658]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[01:51:41.658 --> 01:51:43.979]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[01:51:44.259 --> 01:51:45.961]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[01:52:06.288 --> 01:52:07.749]  9-11 was an inside job!
[01:52:07.749 --> 01:52:09.349]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:52:09.349 --> 01:52:11.010]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:52:11.010 --> 01:52:13.911]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:52:13.911 --> 01:52:18.953]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the bilateral commission, the CFR?
[01:52:18.953 --> 01:52:27.196]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[01:52:27.196 --> 01:52:32.118]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:52:39.941 --> 01:52:43.403]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:52:43.403 --> 01:52:46.264]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:52:46.264 --> 01:52:52.748]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[01:52:57.851 --> 01:53:00.332]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:53:01.838 --> 01:53:07.140]  How much longer will you ignore the warning signs?
[01:53:07.140 --> 01:53:11.501]  How much longer will you turn away like a blind man?
[01:53:11.501 --> 01:53:16.442]  The choice of life or death, abundance or starvation is made today.
[01:53:16.442 --> 01:53:18.063]  Do you have a long-term food solution?
[01:53:19.338 --> 01:53:21.720]  Go to SurvivalistSeeds.com.

[01:53:46.698 --> 01:53:47.198]  Patriots prepare.
[01:53:47.719 --> 01:53:49.180]  Slaves hesitate.
[01:53:49.180 --> 01:53:50.842]  Soon we'll know which one you are.
[01:53:50.842 --> 01:53:51.803]  You have no more excuses.
[01:54:15.785 --> 01:54:17.166]  Alright folks, we are back.
[01:54:17.166 --> 01:54:19.567]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:19.567 --> 01:54:21.769]  I'm Jason Burma sitting in.
[01:54:21.769 --> 01:54:26.592]  Why can't we get the CCR version of that one?
[01:54:26.592 --> 01:54:28.973]  I'm a bigger fan of that.
[01:54:38.599 --> 01:54:41.140]  All right, we're going to take your phone calls with Rosalind Peterson.
[01:54:41.140 --> 01:54:42.360]  This is the final segment.
[01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:44.640]  CaliforniaSkyWatch.com is the website.
[01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:47.841]  TJ in Minnesota, what's on your mind?
[01:54:47.841 --> 01:54:48.881]  You there, TJ?
[01:54:48.881 --> 01:54:49.921]  Yeah, are you there?
[01:54:49.921 --> 01:54:50.762]  Yes, sir.
[01:54:50.762 --> 01:54:59.663]  Okay, Rosalind, I commend your feminine view on this spray plane problem we've had for about nine years here in the Upper Midwest.
[01:54:59.663 --> 01:55:07.545]  I think your narrow approach might be very well constructive to the masses, wherein they won't believe it
[01:55:08.178 --> 01:55:14.563]  All of the realities surrounding this diabolical operation, they can't deny bad weather.
[01:55:14.563 --> 01:55:16.805]  And so, I commend you for that approach.
[01:55:16.805 --> 01:55:23.050]  And it remains to be seen if we'll win this battle against these flying bastardos.
[01:55:23.050 --> 01:55:24.832]  But, I want to tell you something.
[01:55:24.832 --> 01:55:29.436]  There's a Clear Channel radio station in north central Iowa.
[01:55:29.436 --> 01:55:36.742]  And in the past three or four months, before they give a weather forecast, one of their own boys,
[01:55:38.052 --> 01:55:59.229]  It's interjected in the weather forecast on radio amplitude modulation AM clear channel and it says weather modification and then it goes on to say what's in store for you today and I called the radio station and made an inquiry and they acted like they hadn't even heard their own programming.
[01:55:59.229 --> 01:56:02.852]  Well I think they're trying to acclimate people.
[01:56:02.852 --> 01:56:03.353]  What do you think?
[01:56:03.353 --> 01:56:03.953]  Absolutely.
[01:56:06.345 --> 01:56:12.888]  I think the National Weather Service has been talking about, well, we have to save the planet, so we have to modify the weather.
[01:56:12.888 --> 01:56:23.013]  And I think if we stop modifying the weather and stop all these programs, we wouldn't be having so many problems and so much unusual weather.
[01:56:23.013 --> 01:56:24.574]  All right, let's jump to the next caller.
[01:56:24.574 --> 01:56:25.954]  Let's go to Scott in Arizona.
[01:56:25.954 --> 01:56:28.796]  Scott, what's on your mind?
[01:56:28.796 --> 01:56:30.016]  Hey, how are you guys?
[01:56:30.016 --> 01:56:30.957]  Good.
[01:56:30.957 --> 01:56:32.858]  Okay, well, I've researched this.
[01:56:34.142 --> 01:56:36.124]  The Chemtrail thing for a long time.
[01:56:36.124 --> 01:56:45.092]  And I have the real answers of what, um, to give proof to the media to actually, you know, just like Rosalind's talking about, but there's a program I haven't heard her mention.
[01:56:45.092 --> 01:56:48.075]  It's called the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program.
[01:56:48.075 --> 01:56:52.219]  That's the ARM program and it's part of the DOE, Department of Energy.
[01:56:52.219 --> 01:56:57.704]  And in that program, it's directed with universities and Pacific Northwest National Labs.
[01:56:57.704 --> 01:56:58.765]  They have their own website.
[01:56:59.326 --> 01:57:01.947]  In there, they talk about how they put the stuff in the air.
[01:57:01.947 --> 01:57:06.108]  It's called Indirect, Semi-Direct, Indirect Aerosol Campaign.
[01:57:06.108 --> 01:57:07.428]  You can Google all that stuff.
[01:57:07.428 --> 01:57:08.449]  I brought this up to Alex.
[01:57:08.449 --> 01:57:10.969]  He checked it out, and he flipped out over it.
[01:57:10.969 --> 01:57:12.950]  And he said this guy, he wanted me to write a story.
[01:57:12.950 --> 01:57:18.191]  I just, you know, I'm not the kind of computer savvy as far as writing stories and stuff, but I haven't done that yet.
[01:57:18.191 --> 01:57:21.452]  Well, maybe you can, uh, maybe you can email this stuff to, uh, Rosalyn.
[01:57:21.452 --> 01:57:23.733]  Let me get her take before the end of the segment on this stuff.
[01:57:23.733 --> 01:57:25.233]  Rosalyn?
[01:57:25.233 --> 01:57:27.174]  Uh, yes, you can email me the information.
[01:57:27.174 --> 01:57:27.934]  That would be great.
[01:57:28.934 --> 01:57:30.935]  Anything else there, Scott?
[01:57:30.935 --> 01:57:32.355]  Yeah, there is.
[01:57:32.355 --> 01:57:36.856]  On that ARM program, remember, it's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program.
[01:57:36.856 --> 01:57:37.857]  So it's called the ARM program.
[01:57:37.857 --> 01:57:41.838]  All you have to do is type in ARM program for the DOE, okay?
[01:57:41.838 --> 01:57:43.959]  And you'll get, and your site will come right up.
[01:57:43.959 --> 01:57:45.159]  You can do that.
[01:57:45.159 --> 01:57:48.340]  And then once you do that, then you can come around in there.
[01:57:48.340 --> 01:57:51.721]  It's kind of, it's kind of a secret site, I mean, a secured site.
[01:57:51.721 --> 01:57:54.562]  So you can get some information off of it, general information.
[01:57:54.562 --> 01:57:58.023]  Then all you have to do is type in indirect, semi-direct,
[01:57:58.658 --> 01:57:59.200]  Or direct.
[01:57:59.200 --> 01:58:07.520]  You can type either one of those, aerosol campaign, and you will get what they're doing in the air, and it's called scattering when they put the...
[01:58:08.203 --> 01:58:10.344]  The particles up in the air is called scattering.
[01:58:10.344 --> 01:58:14.446]  There is a whistleblower that formed this a long time ago.
[01:58:14.446 --> 01:58:17.248]  I haven't checked him out to see how much credibility he has.
[01:58:17.248 --> 01:58:20.910]  Alright, I've got to let you go, Scott, but please send that information to Rosalind Peterson.
[01:58:20.910 --> 01:58:22.931]  Rosalind, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:58:22.931 --> 01:58:24.812]  Oh, and thank you for having me on the show.
[01:58:24.812 --> 01:58:26.573]  It's CaliforniaSkyWatch.com.
[01:58:26.573 --> 01:58:27.233]  Really great guest.
[01:58:27.233 --> 01:58:29.254]  We'll be back after this with Bob Chapman.
[01:58:29.254 --> 01:58:31.916]  Remember, InfoWars.com for the live DNC feed.
[01:58:42.955 --> 01:58:45.577]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.577 --> 01:58:51.641]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.641 --> 01:58:58.366]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:58:58.366 --> 01:59:00.048]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:59:00.999 --> 01:59:02.541]  But who is the enemy?
[01:59:02.541 --> 01:59:03.342]  Bin Laden.
[01:59:03.342 --> 01:59:04.383]  This is his M.O.
[01:59:04.383 --> 01:59:05.704]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:59:05.704 --> 01:59:07.686]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:59:07.686 --> 01:59:14.853]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:59:14.853 --> 01:59:15.334]  Some U.S.
[01:59:15.334 --> 01:59:20.980]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:59:21.680 --> 01:59:25.183]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:59:25.183 --> 01:59:27.986]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:59:53.923 --> 01:59:56.325]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.325 --> 02:00:05.692]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.692 --> 02:00:07.013]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.013 --> 02:00:08.774]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.774 --> 02:00:10.535]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.535 --> 02:00:12.097]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.097 --> 02:00:13.658]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.658 --> 02:00:17.861]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.861 --> 02:00:21.924]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.542 --> 02:00:27.048]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back.
[02:00:27.048 --> 02:00:28.270]  I am not Alex Jones.
[02:00:28.270 --> 02:00:30.694]  I'm Jason Bermas, sitting in today, tomorrow.
[02:00:30.694 --> 02:00:33.117]  And remember, there will be a Best of the Week.
[02:00:34.494 --> 02:00:39.297]  With Alex Jones' adventures from the DNC already making national news all over the place.
[02:00:39.297 --> 02:00:43.959]  I think it was Inside Edition, not Extra, that was coming over today, but I'm not quite sure.
[02:00:43.959 --> 02:00:45.580]  He was on Russia Today.
[02:00:45.580 --> 02:00:46.781]  We aired that clip.
[02:00:46.781 --> 02:00:53.845]  He broke through on MSNBC for about 40 minutes, chanting 9-11 was an inside job and Infowars.com.
[02:00:53.845 --> 02:00:56.527]  Of course, he had that altercation with Michelle Malkin.
[02:00:56.527 --> 02:01:00.149]  And it's so funny, I'm sitting here and I'm reading some of these bloggers.
[02:01:01.283 --> 02:01:11.988]  And Mashable.com is calling Alex a, you know, not only did he call for a death, but he's an ultra left-wing hardcore leftist, and he was there to levitate the mint.
[02:01:11.988 --> 02:01:12.528]  No he wasn't!
[02:01:13.129 --> 02:01:15.030]  He was walking through the crowd.
[02:01:15.030 --> 02:01:20.234]  None of us are dumb enough to dress up like wizards and think we're going to levitate the MIT.
[02:01:20.234 --> 02:01:25.017]  No, he was trying to get press attention to the monster that is Michelle Malkin.
[02:01:25.017 --> 02:01:28.939]  Somebody who literally calls for internment camps for Americans.
[02:01:28.939 --> 02:01:34.123]  Someone who literally lies about the soldiers killing innocent animals and people, unfortunately.
[02:01:34.123 --> 02:01:37.004]  I mean, you know, some of the people over there are lost folks.
[02:01:37.004 --> 02:01:38.365]  They shoot to kill.
[02:01:38.365 --> 02:01:38.665]  Anything.
[02:01:38.665 --> 02:01:39.266]  They enjoy it.
[02:01:39.266 --> 02:01:40.266]  It's sick.
[02:01:40.266 --> 02:01:40.747]  Okay?
[02:01:40.747 --> 02:01:42.148]  And this little propagandist
[02:01:42.828 --> 02:01:46.730]  Gets confronted by Alex and then her little neocon bloggers run over.
[02:01:46.730 --> 02:01:49.512]  One of them has a ridiculous Black Panther Obama hat.
[02:01:49.512 --> 02:01:52.314]  He really looks like he needs to be backhanded.
[02:01:52.314 --> 02:01:56.636]  And, uh, you know, kill Michelle Malkin, kill Mich- Alex is saying kill Michelle Malkin!
[02:01:56.636 --> 02:01:57.697]  No, he wasn't.
[02:01:57.697 --> 02:02:00.699]  Uh, basically he was calling her out on her nonsense.
[02:02:02.119 --> 02:02:07.622]  I want to take this opportunity to thank our great sponsor at eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:02:07.622 --> 02:02:13.645]  That's eFoodsDirect.com, and they are the best storable food people in the business.
[02:02:13.645 --> 02:02:19.568]  I mean, you can literally get your grocery bill for a year cut in half and have peace of mind just in case of a disaster.
[02:02:19.568 --> 02:02:27.391]  Man, with the way Paul Craig Roberts was talking today, I guess you'd be lucky enough to use your storable food if this Russia attack goes down.
[02:02:27.391 --> 02:02:28.332]  Literally talking about
[02:02:28.948 --> 02:02:31.693]  What seemed like Global Armageddon, it was gross.
[02:02:31.693 --> 02:02:33.015]  You can call eFoods Direct at 1-800-409-5633.
[02:02:33.015 --> 02:02:33.376]  That's 1-800-409-5633.
[02:02:33.376 --> 02:02:34.858]  And in a country right now where, you know...
[02:02:41.195 --> 02:02:43.256]  They ration rice and grain in some places.
[02:02:43.256 --> 02:02:44.657]  You can only get so many bags.
[02:02:44.657 --> 02:02:46.518]  It's pretty wild.
[02:02:46.518 --> 02:02:51.482]  And these people will sell you what you need to survive in case of an emergency.
[02:02:51.482 --> 02:02:53.143]  It's efoodsdirect.com.
[02:02:53.143 --> 02:02:54.183]  You can call them again at 1-800-409-5633.
[02:02:54.183 --> 02:03:05.070]  And we're going to be joined now by Bob Chapman of the internationalforecaster.com to get his take on the DNC and how things are going down there.
[02:03:05.070 --> 02:03:07.092]  Bob, are you with us?
[02:03:07.092 --> 02:03:07.612]  I am with you.
[02:03:07.612 --> 02:03:08.833]  How are you doing today, sir?
[02:03:09.355 --> 02:03:10.156]  I'm pretty good.
[02:03:10.156 --> 02:03:17.762]  I guess that the Democrats are fighting among themselves, and I'm sure the Republicans will do the same.
[02:03:17.762 --> 02:03:24.808]  Wherever you've got power going on, there's always somebody who wants to get a leg up.
[02:03:24.808 --> 02:03:29.652]  And Hillary let everybody know she was mad at her husband.
[02:03:31.039 --> 02:03:33.461]  For hurting our chances for the nomination.
[02:03:33.461 --> 02:03:35.042]  Did she say that in the speech last night?
[02:03:35.042 --> 02:03:41.306]  I mean, I didn't catch her speech, but uh... Some of their close associates said that.
[02:03:41.306 --> 02:03:44.688]  And I guess Bill was up and white some way up in the gallery.
[02:03:44.688 --> 02:03:46.229]  I didn't see it.
[02:03:46.229 --> 02:03:50.311]  But, um... You know, it's all a show.
[02:03:50.311 --> 02:03:57.176]  As we know, the candidates will be what the alumnus behind the scenes want them to be and who they will be.
[02:03:57.176 --> 02:04:00.338]  And our sheeple will get to vote for them.
[02:04:01.323 --> 02:04:08.566]  In fact, I cover that briefly in today's International Forecaster.
[02:04:08.566 --> 02:04:19.251]  And so, I think what we've got to aim at is Congress in this next election, and with the exception of a few people, get rid of them all!
[02:04:19.251 --> 02:04:20.131]  We don't need them.
[02:04:20.131 --> 02:04:27.494]  Let's get some new people in there, some ladies and gentlemen who want to really represent their constituents and not
[02:04:28.567 --> 02:04:33.388]  The banking sector, or Wall Street, or corporate America?
[02:04:33.388 --> 02:04:36.869]  Well, I want to talk about that on the other side.
[02:04:36.869 --> 02:04:42.350]  I think a good test to see if we'll be able to actually do that is whether we can elect Cindy Sheehan or not.
[02:04:42.350 --> 02:04:52.113]  If we can get Sheehan in office over Pelosi, I think there might be hope that others may take her lead and run for Congress, not on behalf of the special interests, but on behalf of we the people.
[02:04:52.113 --> 02:04:53.033]  We'll be back after this.
[02:04:53.033 --> 02:04:55.194]  It's InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:05:05.965 --> 02:05:07.086]  Here's a story.
[02:05:07.086 --> 02:05:07.946]  You wash your car.
[02:05:07.946 --> 02:05:09.167]  How long does it last?
[02:05:09.167 --> 02:05:09.948]  Three days?
[02:05:09.948 --> 02:05:10.588]  A week?
[02:05:10.588 --> 02:05:11.529]  Two weeks?
[02:05:11.529 --> 02:05:16.993]  Life Change Tea eliminates chemicals, toxins, and parasites, and much more.
[02:05:16.993 --> 02:05:17.733]  The effect?
[02:05:17.733 --> 02:05:18.714]  You lose weight.
[02:05:18.714 --> 02:05:19.174]  That's right.
[02:05:19.174 --> 02:05:20.115]  You lose weight.
[02:05:20.115 --> 02:05:21.476]  So here's the story.
[02:05:21.476 --> 02:05:22.497]  You wash your car.
[02:05:22.497 --> 02:05:23.617]  It gets dirty again.
[02:05:23.617 --> 02:05:24.738]  You cleanse your body.
[02:05:24.738 --> 02:05:26.739]  Chemicals and toxins come back.
[02:05:26.739 --> 02:05:27.060]  The fix?
[02:05:27.680 --> 02:05:28.861]  Stay on the T!

[02:05:30.782 --> 02:05:34.163]  Ask for the Mid-State Fair Special when ordering.

[02:07:06.489 --> 02:07:10.513]  These heavy metal toxins are difficult or even impossible to avoid.
[02:07:10.513 --> 02:07:14.476]  Even trace amounts of these heavy metals over time can impact your health.
[02:07:14.476 --> 02:07:19.380]  Many health problems have been suggested as being related to this heavy metal exposure, including memory loss.
[02:07:19.500 --> 02:07:19.860]  I don't know.
[02:07:44.377 --> 02:07:46.638]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:16.974 --> 02:08:18.336]  All right, folks, we are back.
[02:08:18.336 --> 02:08:19.698]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:19.698 --> 02:08:21.822]  I am Jason Verma, sitting in for Alex.
[02:08:21.822 --> 02:08:27.611]  Remember Fabled Enemies drops August 31st on PrisonPlanet.tv and chips out September 1st.
[02:08:27.611 --> 02:08:30.756]  It is my latest, my greatest, and I think in the next segment we will play
[02:08:32.202 --> 02:08:56.649]  uh... the israeli operatives chapter uh... i'm sorry trailer and right now we have bob chapman of the international forecaster dot com on with us and we were just discussing you know how we need to get rid of ninety-plus percent of uh... the congressional members in this country the house let's get rid of the house and i was saying you know a good test to see if we're willing to do that is if we can get uh... cindy sheehan in there i mean a woman who is literally sacrifice
[02:08:57.269 --> 02:09:07.699]  One of her sons oversees in this war has been relentless and in the last I'd say what has it been like five six years in trying to end this war and She's come out for 9-11 truth folks.
[02:09:07.699 --> 02:09:08.679]  She's very smart.
[02:09:08.679 --> 02:09:09.440]  She's very hip.
[02:09:09.440 --> 02:09:11.322]  She's very savvy in what she says.
[02:09:11.322 --> 02:09:13.324]  What do you think Bob?
[02:09:13.324 --> 02:09:13.444]  I?
[02:09:13.444 --> 02:09:15.986]  Think that'd be terrific and I think you're right.
[02:09:15.986 --> 02:09:23.132]  I think if it looked like she had a real shot at it I think even in this election It would encourage people
[02:09:24.375 --> 02:09:28.217]  To get rid of the likes of Pelosi and other parts of the country.
[02:09:28.217 --> 02:09:34.461]  And all of the rest of them that continue to get re-elected because they have the funds to do so.
[02:09:34.461 --> 02:09:38.283]  And then don't represent their constituency.
[02:09:38.283 --> 02:09:49.470]  They go right to the Illuminati and get their payoff, which is campaign contributions and all the favors that are supplied to their friends, corporate friends, and personal friends.
[02:09:50.462 --> 02:09:52.783]  And they vote the way they're told to vote.
[02:09:52.783 --> 02:09:54.663]  And let's stop there for just one second.
[02:09:54.663 --> 02:09:57.824]  You just said special interests and they go right to the Illuminists.
[02:09:57.824 --> 02:10:02.685]  A congressman makes somewhere, what, between like 80 G's and 120 G's a year.
[02:10:02.685 --> 02:10:06.406]  And do you really think that you can win a congressional seat on that?
[02:10:06.406 --> 02:10:07.046]  Of course not.
[02:10:07.046 --> 02:10:10.387]  You're owned by your corporate masters, correct Bob?
[02:10:10.387 --> 02:10:11.467]  Exactly.
[02:10:11.467 --> 02:10:18.249]  And I think the way to handle that is everybody who runs for the House and Senate is allotted so much money that they can use.
[02:10:19.488 --> 02:10:19.688]  I agree.
[02:10:19.688 --> 02:10:22.409]  And it would be arbitrarily, let's say, $5 million.
[02:10:22.409 --> 02:10:25.391]  And that's it.
[02:10:25.391 --> 02:10:34.734]  And so that means that someone who has piled the money available, whether it's personal or not, cannot go into a campaign and spend $50 million.
[02:10:34.734 --> 02:10:38.456]  They have to campaign on the issues.
[02:10:38.456 --> 02:10:38.856]  And that's it.
[02:10:39.659 --> 02:10:42.000]  It would be an amazing thing.
[02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:46.761]  It would really be the first step, in my eyes, at restoring the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[02:10:46.761 --> 02:10:49.662]  I mean, I think we really have to take the special interest money out of it.
[02:10:49.662 --> 02:10:55.844]  Because, like you said, when there's no cap on it, it's kind of like, you know, they're the Yankees and we're the Brewers.
[02:10:55.844 --> 02:10:56.685]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:10:56.685 --> 02:11:03.127]  We don't have a shot to even make the playoffs, but they can just buy any pitcher, catcher, anything they need.
[02:11:03.127 --> 02:11:06.908]  And if you can run, you know, a $50 million campaign for somebody else,
[02:11:07.228 --> 02:11:08.488]  And the other candidate can spend $500,000.
[02:11:08.488 --> 02:11:12.129]  Gee, I wonder who's gonna win?
[02:11:12.129 --> 02:11:19.491]  Well, I was certainly borne out recently, in recent years, by Corzine in New Jersey.
[02:11:19.491 --> 02:11:23.812]  He just poured enormous amounts of money into the campaign.
[02:11:23.812 --> 02:11:27.452]  And, you know, that's not what democracy is about.
[02:11:27.452 --> 02:11:29.593]  And it's gotta be stopped.
[02:11:29.593 --> 02:11:34.694]  And, of course, you have a segment of Congress that may not be purchased
[02:11:35.496 --> 02:11:43.658]  But they are compromised because they have unusual personal lifestyles, or have had before.
[02:11:43.658 --> 02:11:45.438]  And wait, let me stop you right there.
[02:11:45.438 --> 02:11:51.159]  Unusual personal lifestyles does not begin to tell people what these guys are into.
[02:11:51.159 --> 02:12:02.382]  Last night, I was actually, I spent most of my time scanning in Alex's Bohemian Grove annals so I can put it into PDF format and throw it in my next film, Invisible Empire.
[02:12:02.382 --> 02:12:03.062]  And we're talking
[02:12:03.642 --> 02:12:09.928]  Not only the Owl God, the Cremation of Care Ceremony, but guys in drag everywhere.
[02:12:09.928 --> 02:12:16.813]  I mean, it seems like this is like their most fun thing to do is get dressed up in drag and pretend they're a Broadway star, Bob.
[02:12:16.813 --> 02:12:17.494]  What's up with that?
[02:12:18.982 --> 02:12:35.336]  Well, they call them cross-dressers, and they've been around for a long time, and many, many of them practice pedophilia and other things that most people in society don't do.
[02:12:35.336 --> 02:12:37.538]  And when they get into Congress,
[02:12:38.859 --> 02:12:54.838]  Uh, the powers behind Congress, if they know that, and they usually do, will approach them and say, look, you know, if you don't want anybody to know that you chase little girls or little boys or whatever, then I think you ought to vote for this issue and that issue and this issue and that issue.
[02:12:54.958 --> 02:13:01.805]  And case in point there is a guy like Tom Foley who's actually heading up the government's CPS department.
[02:13:01.805 --> 02:13:06.309]  He's on TV saying, we're going after these predators, we're going to make sure that they pay.
[02:13:06.309 --> 02:13:17.661]  And then it comes out that he's, and I'm sure it was a lot more hardcore than what just came out in the mainstream media, but he is giving quote-unquote inappropriate text to his 16-year-old page at a high school.
[02:13:17.661 --> 02:13:18.742]  His mail page, by the way.
[02:13:19.062 --> 02:13:27.787]  You know, so the guy at the top who's supposed to be protecting children from predators is preying on children, Bob.
[02:13:27.787 --> 02:13:28.727]  It's tragic.
[02:13:28.727 --> 02:13:34.831]  And, um, you know, America today has lost their moorings.
[02:13:34.831 --> 02:13:37.652]  People shrug their shoulders and say, what can I do about it?
[02:13:37.652 --> 02:13:39.553]  Or what do I care?
[02:13:39.553 --> 02:13:41.694]  Or let them do what they want.
[02:13:41.694 --> 02:13:44.436]  And, you know, these sort of people,
[02:13:45.220 --> 02:13:54.834]  Really shouldn't be handling responsible positions because most people in society don't do those kind of things.
[02:13:54.834 --> 02:14:00.042]  And if they knew it, I think that they might be hesitant to vote for them.
[02:14:00.746 --> 02:14:24.085]  I would hope so, because another thing that really, really bothers me about the Illuminists, this elitist organization, is that many of them pose as Christian conservatives with a happy family, they believe in Jesus Christ, and the people that follow them are often, you know, just mindless Christians that go to church, they think their church tells them the truth, they think that George Bush worships Jesus Christ, and then you find out
[02:14:24.745 --> 02:14:33.192]  That these guys, and I'm not a religious guy, I just can't stand the deception, that these guys are into the occult, like the exact opposite.
[02:14:33.192 --> 02:14:34.053]  Satanic.
[02:14:34.053 --> 02:14:34.534]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:14:34.534 --> 02:14:42.400]  And you know, one of the outstanding figures of Satanism, and most people don't know it, is George Soros.
[02:14:42.400 --> 02:14:42.841]  Is that right?
[02:14:42.841 --> 02:14:43.441]  I didn't know that.
[02:14:43.441 --> 02:14:44.222]  Why don't you go into that?
[02:14:44.222 --> 02:14:48.546]  I know he's a billionaire, I know he's a globalist, but I didn't know he was into Luciferianism.
[02:14:48.546 --> 02:14:51.088]  Oh yes, and you know, he
[02:14:51.984 --> 02:15:10.017]  When he lived in Eastern Europe during the 1940s and the Germans came in, he hid his identity and went to work with the Germans confiscating the assets of Jewish people.
[02:15:10.017 --> 02:15:15.340]  And that's probably about as low as you can get in as much as he was Jewish.
[02:15:15.340 --> 02:15:20.184]  And what he's doing is he's pulling the chain on all of his co-religionists
[02:15:21.252 --> 02:15:28.714]  You know, getting him sent off to camps, and they either worked to death, or whatever happened, they died, most of them.
[02:15:28.714 --> 02:15:36.755]  And here he is, running around, splitting the tank with the Gestapo, and it's sickening.
[02:15:36.755 --> 02:15:50.098]  And here today, he is the one, through his non-governmental organizations, NGOs, as they're known, he's the one who, ten years ago, with his Open Society funds,
[02:15:50.951 --> 02:16:03.380]  And funds from the UN infiltrated all these former Soviet Union countries, such as Ukraine and Georgia and many others.
[02:16:03.380 --> 02:16:10.405]  And they infiltrated, they wormed their way into those governments and took control of them.
[02:16:10.405 --> 02:16:13.508]  I mean, this guy, Sherrod, what is this?
[02:16:15.280 --> 02:16:16.880]  Um, the one from Georgia.
[02:16:16.880 --> 02:16:19.241]  Oh, Sockerville.
[02:16:19.241 --> 02:16:19.701]  That's it.
[02:16:19.701 --> 02:16:20.921]  Sockerville.
[02:16:20.921 --> 02:16:24.262]  I'm not good on linguistics today.
[02:16:24.262 --> 02:16:28.322]  He, uh, and I speak five languages, too.
[02:16:28.322 --> 02:16:29.503]  You'll have to excuse me.
[02:16:29.503 --> 02:16:30.863]  Hey, that's okay.
[02:16:30.863 --> 02:16:34.744]  But anyway, he was trained every year.
[02:16:34.744 --> 02:16:40.445]  In fact, Sockerville was at the Davos
[02:16:43.149 --> 02:16:45.952]  International business gathering.
[02:16:45.952 --> 02:16:52.300]  And for those who don't know what Davos is, it's along the same lines of Bilderberg and these elitist meetings that nobody hears about, correct Bob?
[02:16:52.300 --> 02:16:53.501]  Exactly.
[02:16:53.501 --> 02:16:59.268]  And he's there with George Soros, so they will line this guy up for years.
[02:17:00.109 --> 02:17:03.730]  And now the failure of what they did, they're blaming on him.
[02:17:03.730 --> 02:17:07.371]  Whether he was the cause of it remains to be seen, but I don't think so.
[02:17:07.371 --> 02:17:14.753]  It was, again, another poor planning event, both by Brzezinski as well as the White House.
[02:17:14.753 --> 02:17:19.354]  I mean, you know, these are truly the guys that can't shoot straight.
[02:17:19.354 --> 02:17:22.014]  I mean, they can't do anything right.
[02:17:22.014 --> 02:17:23.835]  I mean, they had over a thousand
[02:17:25.526 --> 02:17:33.733]  Blackwater advisers, over a thousand Israeli advisers who have been training him for a long time.
[02:17:33.733 --> 02:17:37.797]  They've been giving him munitions for over five years.
[02:17:37.797 --> 02:17:41.660]  And they set up this attack and then they get defeated.
[02:17:41.660 --> 02:17:48.687]  And another thing too is that they had to have thought that the Russians were going to run in terror.
[02:17:49.836 --> 02:17:51.918]  And, uh, or not participate.
[02:17:51.918 --> 02:17:53.099]  Say, oh, we're sorry.
[02:17:53.099 --> 02:17:56.601]  Uh, you know, you guys can come in here and take this over.
[02:17:56.601 --> 02:18:06.468]  But, uh, they underestimated Mr. Putin and, uh, their new, uh, president, uh, and so, uh, they turned around and kicked their butts for them.
[02:18:06.468 --> 02:18:11.612]  In fact, the Georgians just ran in terror because they expected a lay down and that's not what happened.
[02:18:12.682 --> 02:18:14.824]  I don't know how they could have actually expected a lay-down.
[02:18:14.824 --> 02:18:19.387]  Do you think that was because of, you know, all the NATO forces that have surrounded Russia in the previous years?
[02:18:19.387 --> 02:18:27.312]  Do you think that maybe it was the United States kind of in their ear going, well, you know, you go take South Ossetia, maybe you'll be a part of NATO right after that?
[02:18:27.312 --> 02:18:29.213]  That would be a strong showing.
[02:18:29.213 --> 02:18:32.236]  And they did it, and then they just got burnt.
[02:18:32.236 --> 02:18:34.197]  Well, it was psychopolitical warfare.
[02:18:35.055 --> 02:18:38.998]  Which Brzezinski is very good at, probably among the best.
[02:18:38.998 --> 02:18:40.179]  And he blew it!
[02:18:40.179 --> 02:18:45.282]  It's as simple as that, just like the White House and the neocons in America.
[02:18:45.282 --> 02:18:49.865]  They blew Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:18:49.865 --> 02:18:54.288]  It's a total cluster of mistakes.
[02:18:54.288 --> 02:18:56.210]  And you all know what I'm saying.
[02:18:56.210 --> 02:19:02.053]  And finally, the Iraqis are saying, please, get out of here!
[02:19:02.053 --> 02:19:03.835]  I mean, everything you touch falls down!
[02:19:04.955 --> 02:19:07.337]  Yeah, even their puppet dictator that they installed.
[02:19:07.337 --> 02:19:15.525]  But that's all good for us, Jason, because that put their plan for world government back 50, maybe 30 to 50 years.
[02:19:15.525 --> 02:19:16.766]  I hope it's 100 years.
[02:19:16.766 --> 02:19:17.587]  And so that's terrific!
[02:19:18.359 --> 02:19:26.541]  But the point is that they picked on the wrong junkyard dog, and that is Mr. Putin.
[02:19:26.541 --> 02:19:29.222]  And they changed their whole attitude.
[02:19:29.222 --> 02:19:38.504]  You know, I spent a long time spying on Russia during the Cold War, and these people are not dumb.
[02:19:38.504 --> 02:19:41.225]  Yeah, the KGB and FSB are pretty intelligent.
[02:19:41.989 --> 02:19:42.529]  Pardon me?
[02:19:42.529 --> 02:19:45.531]  I said the FSV and the KGB seem to be pretty on the ball.
[02:19:45.531 --> 02:19:47.812]  We'll come back to Bob Chapman after this.
[02:19:47.812 --> 02:20:01.639]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:20:01.639 --> 02:20:08.402]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:20:08.402 --> 02:20:10.083]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:20:11.033 --> 02:20:12.574]  But who is the enemy?
[02:20:12.574 --> 02:20:13.375]  Bin Laden.
[02:20:13.375 --> 02:20:14.216]  This is his M.O.
[02:20:14.216 --> 02:20:15.737]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:20:15.737 --> 02:20:17.719]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:20:17.719 --> 02:20:24.885]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:20:24.885 --> 02:20:25.366]  Some U.S.
[02:20:25.366 --> 02:20:31.031]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:20:31.711 --> 02:20:35.212]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:20:35.212 --> 02:20:37.373]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:21:02.515 --> 02:21:04.216]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[02:21:04.216 --> 02:21:04.497]  August 27, 2008.
[02:21:04.497 --> 02:21:05.217]  Gold opened at $828.50.
[02:21:05.217 --> 02:21:08.360]  One ounce gold coins can be purchased for $853.36, $420.58 for half ounce, and $210.29 for quarter ounce.
[02:21:08.360 --> 02:21:09.160]  That's $853.36, $420.58, and $210.29.
[02:21:19.128 --> 02:21:24.751]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[02:21:24.751 --> 02:21:29.072]  Treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing the Yan Revolution.
[02:21:29.072 --> 02:21:36.996]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[02:21:36.996 --> 02:21:39.397]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[02:21:39.677 --> 02:21:43.479]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[02:21:43.479 --> 02:21:49.761]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.
[02:21:49.761 --> 02:21:53.083]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[02:21:53.083 --> 02:21:56.124]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[02:21:56.124 --> 02:21:56.444]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:56.444 --> 02:21:56.784]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:22:01.573 --> 02:22:02.554]  Hey, Clyde!
[02:22:02.554 --> 02:22:03.554]  What's up, Bonnie?
[02:22:03.554 --> 02:22:08.017]  Well, I got a question about those shielded, secure sleeves from Identity Stronghold.
[02:22:08.017 --> 02:22:12.760]  Yeah, the sleeves that block us from stealing account numbers from the new credit cards with RFID chips.
[02:22:12.760 --> 02:22:13.560]  What about them?
[02:22:13.560 --> 02:22:18.003]  Well, I mentioned them to our friends, and they want info on purchasing the secure sleeves.
[02:22:18.003 --> 02:22:19.024]  Aw, Bonnie!
[02:22:19.024 --> 02:22:25.528]  If everyone starts hearing about the secure sleeve, it'll destroy our plan to steal credit card numbers at the mall with my new RFID reader.
[02:22:25.528 --> 02:22:27.269]  I know, but these are our friends, Clyde.
[02:22:27.269 --> 02:22:28.830]  They promised not to tell anyone else.
[02:22:29.210 --> 02:22:30.191]  I guess you're right.
[02:22:30.191 --> 02:22:31.993]  That's what friends are for, I suppose.
[02:22:31.993 --> 02:22:37.759]  Tell them they can get a five-pack of secure sleeves that will fit credit cards and driver's licenses for $19.95.
[02:22:37.759 --> 02:22:43.144]  And Identity Stronghold also has a three-pack of secure sleeves for passport books for $14.95.
[02:22:43.144 --> 02:22:44.526]  And where do they buy them?
[02:22:44.526 --> 02:22:48.670]  They can buy them online or get a mail-in order form at IDStronghold.com.
[02:22:48.670 --> 02:22:50.852]  IDStronghold.com.
[02:22:50.852 --> 02:22:52.294]  Okay, well, what if they don't have the Internet?
[02:22:52.774 --> 02:22:53.574]  They can call 1-800-610-2770.
[02:22:53.574 --> 02:22:54.875]  That's 800-610-2770.
[02:22:54.875 --> 02:23:02.558]  Thanks Clyde!
[02:23:02.558 --> 02:23:10.001]  Even terrible gas prices don't come close to the disaster of food costs from shortages already destroying millions of American families.
[02:23:10.001 --> 02:23:14.063]  Wheat for flour is already four times more expensive than it was about a year ago.
[02:23:14.063 --> 02:23:16.544]  Food costs continue to double because there's no food
[02:23:21.254 --> 02:23:22.015]  We're good to go!
[02:23:39.791 --> 02:23:47.300]  eFoodsDirect.com also has a complete bulk supply of superfood at half the cost of last year's groceries.
[02:23:47.300 --> 02:23:49.802]  Call 800-409-5633.
[02:23:49.802 --> 02:23:55.549]  The rest of the world is starving, but what happens in your piece of America is up to you.
[02:23:55.549 --> 02:23:55.749]  Call 800-409-5633.
[02:24:12.839 --> 02:24:15.901]  I wish a buck was still silver.
[02:24:15.901 --> 02:24:22.726]  It was back when the country was strong.
[02:24:22.726 --> 02:24:24.467]  Alright folks, we are back.
[02:24:24.467 --> 02:24:25.628]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:25.628 --> 02:24:29.811]  I'm Jason Bermas, sitting in with Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:24:29.811 --> 02:24:41.919]  I want to remind people that Alex and myself will be in New York City on September 10th to show Fabled Enemies and Truth Rising and then we will be down at Ground Zero on September 11th talking to people and there's events
[02:24:42.632 --> 02:24:47.214]  On the following weekend, Bob, I kind of want to get into your intelligence service.
[02:24:47.214 --> 02:24:49.255]  It's something we really haven't talked to too much on the show.
[02:24:49.255 --> 02:24:58.859]  I guess that myself and others out there probably have preconceived notions about it by what we've seen in movies and Hollywood and television and even what's on the History Channel and Discovery Channel.
[02:24:58.859 --> 02:25:03.301]  What was it like all those years when you were spying on the Russians?
[02:25:03.301 --> 02:25:06.402]  Well, it was just like any other job.
[02:25:06.402 --> 02:25:11.464]  And most of what I did was in communications counterintelligence.
[02:25:12.398 --> 02:25:24.387]  And so I wasn't running around with a cloak and one of those big black hats and a dagger and a gun because I didn't do that sort of thing.
[02:25:24.387 --> 02:25:41.620]  I used to work in communications and we would intercept all of the things that the Russians and what was then the East Germans and the Poles and one of the reasons I'm so familiar with so many of these regions is
[02:25:42.384 --> 02:26:04.180]  We would go in and we would listen in and copy the transmissions of the NKVD or the KGB or some mechanized army unit that was stationed in Georgia or outside Wausau or wherever.
[02:26:04.955 --> 02:26:09.757]  We did a lot of work with the units in the caucuses.
[02:26:09.757 --> 02:26:16.801]  We copied the mainline diplomatic operator out of Moscow.
[02:26:16.801 --> 02:26:21.643]  And we had great success in breaking their codes.
[02:26:21.643 --> 02:26:26.906]  But I rather suspect that they were equally as proficient as we were.
[02:26:26.906 --> 02:26:30.908]  And that's basically what I did.
[02:26:30.908 --> 02:26:33.409]  But it was an enormous education because
[02:26:34.298 --> 02:26:44.422]  The amount and kind of information we came across was very unusual and we learned how to back into things that
[02:26:45.780 --> 02:26:49.884]  You wouldn't be able to find out what they were doing otherwise.
[02:26:49.884 --> 02:27:02.815]  In other words, if there's a train coming from that direction carrying cement, and there's one coming from the other direction carrying steel, and they're both going to Vladivostok, obviously they're going to build something.
[02:27:02.815 --> 02:27:05.678]  So let's find out what.
[02:27:05.678 --> 02:27:06.339]  Absolutely.
[02:27:06.339 --> 02:27:12.104]  So I gotta ask you, what is the most bizarre, crazy thing that you did come across that you can talk about?
[02:27:13.576 --> 02:27:17.299]  Well, this is a funny story.
[02:27:17.299 --> 02:27:23.665]  We were in our center in the city that I was in at the time, and it was Christmas.
[02:27:23.665 --> 02:27:37.678]  And the Russians came through in clear text, and they started telling us our names, our ranks, where we were from, and on and on and on.
[02:27:37.678 --> 02:27:38.759]  And they were all drunk.
[02:27:39.754 --> 02:27:43.535]  And, uh, because, you know, the thing, they all spoke English.
[02:27:43.535 --> 02:27:43.775]  Uh-huh.
[02:27:43.775 --> 02:28:05.042]  And, uh, the thing all got messed up, but because they were drunk, and they all, we found out later, were reprimanded, and were reduced in rank, and some of them were put in jail for doing what they did, but they let us know how successful their counterintelligence was in Western Germany.
[02:28:05.042 --> 02:28:07.903]  So they basically said, your cover's blown, we know exactly who you are.
[02:28:08.815 --> 02:28:09.815]  Exactly.
[02:28:09.815 --> 02:28:12.136]  Which means they had spies all over the place.
[02:28:12.136 --> 02:28:12.756]  Wow.
[02:28:12.756 --> 02:28:15.277]  And so there wasn't a heck of a lot that we didn't know.
[02:28:15.277 --> 02:28:26.759]  Now, we had people who were with the CIA in Russia, but certainly not in the numbers that, obviously, the Russians had in Western Germany.
[02:28:26.759 --> 02:28:28.900]  I mean, it was incredible.
[02:28:28.900 --> 02:28:34.941]  I mean, we just stood there with our mouths open, and of course, we weren't drinking, we were sober.
[02:28:34.941 --> 02:28:36.802]  And it was just an incredible experience.
[02:28:37.219 --> 02:28:39.240]  I mean, that's got to be pretty unnerving, right?
[02:28:39.240 --> 02:28:41.641]  I mean, do you think, I better get out of here?
[02:28:41.641 --> 02:28:44.783]  I mean, do you immediately... No, that doesn't bother me at all, Jason.
[02:28:44.783 --> 02:28:45.503]  Really?
[02:28:45.503 --> 02:28:53.548]  You know, when you're young and you're well-trained, you know, you like to mix it up.
[02:28:53.548 --> 02:28:57.510]  And, you know, anybody that gets into that kind of situation will tell you that.
[02:29:00.311 --> 02:29:08.774]  Uh, one of the people who did the same kind of work that I did was Porter Goss, who became, uh, later head of the Central Intelligence Agency.
[02:29:08.774 --> 02:29:14.136]  Yeah, just a few years ago, he also headed up the, uh, first congressional investigation into 9-11 with Bob Graham.
[02:29:14.136 --> 02:29:16.057]  He's a lifelong intelligence guy, isn't he?
[02:29:17.412 --> 02:29:23.473]  Yes, and he came out of the same learning surroundings that I did.
[02:29:23.473 --> 02:29:32.616]  And then, in the State Department, we had Peter Galbraith, who worked there for, I guess, probably about 35 years.
[02:29:32.616 --> 02:29:35.296]  His father was John Kenneth Galbraith, the economist.
[02:29:35.296 --> 02:29:36.797]  Very interesting stuff, Bob.
[02:29:36.797 --> 02:29:41.318]  We've got to come back on the other side, though, and we're going to take your phone calls for Bob Chapman and myself.

[02:29:51.534 --> 02:29:52.494]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.494 --> 02:29:54.575]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.575 --> 02:30:01.857]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.857 --> 02:30:07.558]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[02:30:07.558 --> 02:30:08.879]  And we knew what to do.
[02:30:08.879 --> 02:30:10.879]  Or at least we thought we did.
[02:30:10.879 --> 02:30:17.241]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[02:30:17.936 --> 02:30:26.824]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[02:30:26.824 --> 02:30:33.911]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[02:30:33.911 --> 02:30:37.074]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[02:30:37.074 --> 02:30:42.139]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[02:30:42.839 --> 02:30:45.943]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[02:30:54.914 --> 02:30:59.840]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[02:31:01.129 --> 02:31:04.551]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[02:31:04.551 --> 02:31:06.872]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[02:31:06.872 --> 02:31:10.174]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[02:31:10.174 --> 02:31:17.059]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.

[02:31:27.746 --> 02:31:31.669]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.

[02:32:01.292 --> 02:32:05.796]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:32:05.796 --> 02:32:10.901]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:32:10.901 --> 02:32:12.422]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:32:12.422 --> 02:32:16.025]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[02:32:38.724 --> 02:32:40.626]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.

[02:32:56.097 --> 02:32:58.918]  I read the news today, oh boy, about a lucky man who
[02:33:19.366 --> 02:33:25.009]  Good news for you Alex Jones fanatics, it looks like we're going into Overdrive past four hours today.
[02:33:25.009 --> 02:33:29.852]  And we might just have a special little interview for you, uh, straight from the DNC there.
[02:33:29.852 --> 02:33:39.777]  I don't wanna... I don't wanna preclude what's gonna happen, but, uh, definitely gonna have a special guest on in the, uh, final segment in Overdrive.
[02:33:39.777 --> 02:33:45.180]  And, uh, if you missed my Paul Craig Roberts interview earlier today, I mean, he really thinks that this could lead to...
[02:33:46.196 --> 02:33:48.540]  Uh, a nuclear altercation like no other.
[02:33:48.540 --> 02:33:53.666]  One where, I mean, the United States is physically wiped out and the majority of us are killed.
[02:33:53.666 --> 02:33:55.689]  It was pretty gloom and doom.
[02:33:55.689 --> 02:33:57.491]  I'll get Bob Chapman's take on that in a moment.
[02:33:57.491 --> 02:33:59.194]  Before we go to that and to your calls,
[02:34:00.339 --> 02:34:02.041]  What's your take on a guy like Porter Goss?
[02:34:02.041 --> 02:34:18.517]  You know, a lifelong intelligence guy, like I said, heads up the congressional investigation into 9-11, becomes CIA head, I think it was less than a year he actually held the position, but what interests me about him becoming the head of the CIA is that Michael Moore's people actually got an interview with him
[02:34:19.097 --> 02:34:20.838]  Well, I think that he spent his
[02:34:47.759 --> 02:34:57.001]  His early years with the agency in Central and South America, working against Cuba.
[02:34:57.001 --> 02:35:04.042]  And so his perspective probably was relatively narrow.
[02:35:04.042 --> 02:35:10.564]  But I think that in his experience, he decided to go along with the program.
[02:35:10.564 --> 02:35:12.304]  He didn't get out of it.
[02:35:12.304 --> 02:35:15.125]  And as you know, the Iran-Contra
[02:35:16.784 --> 02:35:20.426]  Episode was, uh, Drugs for Guns.
[02:35:20.426 --> 02:35:24.769]  And, uh, there was a major drug-running operation.
[02:35:24.769 --> 02:35:35.074]  And, um, for those of you who, uh, have not, uh, read into that, there's a book called Compromise that was written a number of years ago.
[02:35:35.074 --> 02:35:41.858]  It really explains it in detail from, by someone who was involved in the whole thing.
[02:35:41.858 --> 02:35:44.740]  And, so, that was really Goss's background.
[02:35:45.921 --> 02:36:05.934]  It wasn't a administrative type of background and I think people who run agencies of any kind, they're better off training and working inside and working up within that structure rather than being pulled out of the field.
[02:36:05.934 --> 02:36:07.675]  It's two different lifestyles.
[02:36:08.573 --> 02:36:12.436]  And I think probably that's what he was trying to say.
[02:36:12.436 --> 02:36:14.257]  I'll tell you one thing.
[02:36:14.257 --> 02:36:20.321]  In intelligence work, I never ran into anybody who was dumb.
[02:36:20.321 --> 02:36:32.090]  And maybe Goss didn't have the tools to run the CIA because he'd never been involved in administration, so to speak.
[02:36:32.090 --> 02:36:36.433]  But that doesn't mean he wasn't good at what he did.
[02:36:37.082 --> 02:36:38.904]  Well, yeah, I've spent his whole life.
[02:36:38.904 --> 02:36:41.566]  And just like mine, in business and finance.
[02:37:01.227 --> 02:37:06.549]  Social and political issues have been things that I've worked in and talked about for many years.
[02:37:06.549 --> 02:37:19.755]  I consider investment part of a mosaic, and a lot of what happens in investment and where you go and what you do is based on psycho-political warfare.
[02:37:19.755 --> 02:37:29.979]  And when you can see things that are developing like you referred to just now in relation to what Paul Craig Roberts had to say in your program, and when he and I were on recently,
[02:37:30.814 --> 02:37:39.338]  And that is what is happening today in regard to Russia is extraordinarily important.
[02:37:39.338 --> 02:37:48.523]  It's a major move by the Illuminati powers to put Russia in its place and it's not working.
[02:37:48.523 --> 02:37:56.467]  And at the same time, they know that they're not going to be able to save the financial system and they want a diversion.
[02:37:56.467 --> 02:37:58.728]  And the diversion is another Cold War
[02:37:59.572 --> 02:38:05.864]  And conflict here and there, like in Kosovo and Georgia, and perhaps the Ukraine and other places.
[02:38:06.784 --> 02:38:11.067]  And then again, we'll have a bona fide enemy.
[02:38:11.067 --> 02:38:14.789]  And that enemy, in this case, will be Russia, may even be China as well.
[02:38:36.684 --> 02:38:39.865]  Well, you know, I'll tell ya, he's right.
[02:38:39.865 --> 02:38:47.427]  The only thing is that, and what I'm just saying to you previously, that was just a warm-up.
[02:38:47.427 --> 02:38:50.008]  And the Russians mean business.
[02:38:50.008 --> 02:39:01.991]  And what we've told them is, we're gonna put all kinds of armament and offensive weapons around you, so that you can't do anything.
[02:39:01.991 --> 02:39:05.312]  And we're gonna isolate you, and you better like it.
[02:39:06.363 --> 02:39:09.685]  And Russia's saying, no, we don't like it, and we're going to fight back.
[02:39:09.685 --> 02:39:16.609]  And if the Western European cities argue, we'll shut off all your gas in the middle of winter and you'll freeze.
[02:39:16.609 --> 02:39:22.572]  We'll blow all your cities in Western Europe and your military installations up.
[02:39:22.572 --> 02:39:26.414]  And if we have to use nuclear weapons, we'll use them all over the United States.
[02:39:26.414 --> 02:39:32.738]  And yes, we know we're going to pay a price for that, but we didn't start this thing, you did, and we're not going to lay down for you.
[02:39:33.709 --> 02:39:35.671]  So, Paul Craig Roberts is right.
[02:39:35.671 --> 02:39:36.732]  It could get there.
[02:39:36.732 --> 02:39:38.594]  It is probable.
[02:39:38.594 --> 02:39:40.576]  Not just possible.
[02:39:40.576 --> 02:39:41.497]  That's insane.
[02:39:41.497 --> 02:39:46.181]  I mean, that is just, that's... I don't know, that's another level of depressing for me.
[02:39:46.181 --> 02:39:47.863]  Let's take some calls, Bob.
[02:39:47.863 --> 02:39:50.586]  Let's jump to Fred in Philly.
[02:39:50.586 --> 02:39:51.367]  Fred, what's on your mind?
[02:39:51.367 --> 02:39:54.910]  Fred, are you there?
[02:39:54.910 --> 02:39:57.553]  Alright, if we drop Fred, let's go to... I probably depressed him.
[02:39:58.812 --> 02:40:02.833]  Well, I mean, like I said, you couldn't get more depressing than that first segment.
[02:40:02.833 --> 02:40:05.794]  I mean, I was literally like, well, so what's going to happen?
[02:40:05.794 --> 02:40:09.975]  I mean, are we talking about a new conscription force, a new Mandarby?
[02:40:09.975 --> 02:40:11.616]  He's like, no, we're not talking about that.
[02:40:11.616 --> 02:40:16.497]  We're talking about you wake up and there are cities gone that most of America is dead.
[02:40:16.497 --> 02:40:17.938]  And I'm just like, wow.
[02:40:17.938 --> 02:40:22.479]  I mean, that's craziness to me, but you know, this is a guy who's been around for
[02:40:23.447 --> 02:40:24.007]  Hey, am I there?
[02:40:24.007 --> 02:40:25.168]  Hey, so I'd like to talk about
[02:40:51.380 --> 02:40:58.568]  Well, Mr. Chapman, you were talking about Bohemian societies mixed in with politics.
[02:40:58.568 --> 02:41:08.159]  Now, the thing is, when people give a lot of animosity towards the pagan community and Aleister Crowley,
[02:41:09.215 --> 02:41:11.636]  That they're not getting the full picture.
[02:41:11.636 --> 02:41:24.863]  These people are selfish, devious animals, and let's face it, but when you look into the writings that they study, they have misinterpreted their whole philosophies and their religion.
[02:41:24.863 --> 02:41:29.005]  I mean, in the book of the law of Aleister Crowley, do what thou wilt to be the whole of the law.
[02:41:29.005 --> 02:41:30.066]  The study of the book is forbidden.
[02:41:30.066 --> 02:41:32.147]  It is wise to destroy this copy after the first reading.
[02:41:32.147 --> 02:41:37.790]  Whoever said disregard that does so at his own risk of peril, these are men of stire.
[02:41:38.430 --> 02:41:42.492]  Those who discuss the content of this book are to be shunned by all, as centuries of pestilence.
[02:41:42.492 --> 02:41:50.956]  All questions of the law are to be decided only by appeal to my writings, each for himself.
[02:41:50.956 --> 02:41:52.717]  Each for himself.
[02:41:52.717 --> 02:41:58.120]  Not for a priesthood, not for a satanic priest, a ruler, a leader, no.
[02:41:58.120 --> 02:41:59.300]  Each for himself.
[02:41:59.300 --> 02:42:02.542]  There is no law beyond it that will allow love under will.
[02:42:02.542 --> 02:42:06.724]  And then when people give him crafts for killing 120
[02:42:08.735 --> 02:42:10.677]  Children, they're all so misinterpreting.
[02:42:10.677 --> 02:42:12.198]  Are you talking about Crowley right now?
[02:42:12.198 --> 02:42:13.259]  Crowley coming out of it?
[02:42:13.259 --> 02:42:13.599]  Yeah.
[02:42:13.599 --> 02:42:24.487]  Well, just before you get to that part, I want people to know that the Book of the Law is a book that he wrote that he was supposedly channeled by separate deities, entities, demons, whatever you want to call them, correct?
[02:42:24.487 --> 02:42:28.510]  Yeah, he took his wife to Egypt back in 1903.
[02:42:28.510 --> 02:42:33.715]  He was taking a ritual, and according to him, he got
[02:42:38.035 --> 02:42:54.667]  The Deity Horus, no, the Deity Nuit, the Deity Hadith, Nuit, the Sky God of Hadith, the Earth God, and, uh, Hor Por Krat or Horus, Book of the Warring Child, the three books, um, the three deities.
[02:42:54.667 --> 02:42:59.311]  So your basic point there is that these guys don't even follow their own occultic beliefs?
[02:43:00.060 --> 02:43:01.020]  No, they aren't in here.
[02:43:01.020 --> 02:43:07.122]  Like, in Chapter 12, Crowley even stated he doesn't, he doesn't, uh, he wouldn't like, if he was still alive, he wouldn't like what they're doing today.
[02:43:07.122 --> 02:43:15.385]  In, uh, Chapter 12, it's, it's the, uh, chapter that all the people that say he's a child killer are, like, killing 120 people.
[02:43:15.385 --> 02:43:20.166]  No, he was partaking in a sexual magic, sex magic ritual with his partner.
[02:43:20.166 --> 02:43:22.647]  He had sex 120 times with his partner.
[02:43:23.075 --> 02:43:29.518]  And he sacrificed, in a sense, children, so that, and it was pretty much, he was pretty much saying, I didn't get her.
[02:43:29.518 --> 02:43:31.279]  Alright, Elliot, I thank you for the call.
[02:43:31.279 --> 02:43:32.719]  It's an interesting interpretation.
[02:43:32.719 --> 02:43:36.401]  I'm not going to sit here and defend Aleister Crowley in any way, shape, or form.
[02:43:36.401 --> 02:43:42.044]  I have some kind of, I don't know whether you're a paganist, or maybe you're into those kind of Wiccan beliefs.
[02:43:42.044 --> 02:43:42.564]  Maybe you're not.
[02:43:42.564 --> 02:43:45.885]  Maybe you're totally against them, but I don't think Crowley was a good guy.
[02:43:45.885 --> 02:43:47.626]  I mean, I've studied into it.
[02:43:47.626 --> 02:43:49.447]  Didn't both of his kids wind up dead?
[02:43:50.191 --> 02:43:52.693]  I've read a great deal about him and his thought process lurks
[02:44:14.225 --> 02:44:19.688]  Um, at the base of what Illuminism is.
[02:44:19.688 --> 02:44:27.492]  And, uh, it's the sort of thing that the black nobility in Europe have been involved in for centuries.
[02:44:27.492 --> 02:44:30.654]  And, uh, and he wrote a book about it.
[02:44:30.654 --> 02:44:39.939]  And, uh, had he not, we wouldn't have known his thoughts and the thoughts of many others who, uh, shared his viewpoint.
[02:44:39.939 --> 02:44:42.721]  And, uh, which to me is just pure Satanism.
[02:44:43.818 --> 02:44:49.679]  And, uh, like yourself, um, I don't have anything good to say about him.
[02:44:49.679 --> 02:44:52.700]  I find it surprising when people do.
[02:44:52.700 --> 02:44:58.121]  And, uh, you know, I think that these guys do their own flavor of whatever feels good.
[02:44:58.121 --> 02:45:01.102]  That's what the ultimate root of Luciferianism is.
[02:45:01.102 --> 02:45:02.422]  Do as thou wilt.
[02:45:02.422 --> 02:45:13.164]  So they're probably, no matter, you know, what writings, teachings they've learned, no matter what secret societies they're in and, you know, what level they are in Masonry or Knights Templar or any of these organizations,
[02:45:13.715 --> 02:45:24.180]  You know, I think it comes down to the bottom line that in their brain, and this goes for the majority of them that are in power, they do what they want, and it doesn't matter who's in the lane.
[02:45:24.180 --> 02:45:26.722]  The ends justifies the means, and the ends are for them.
[02:45:26.722 --> 02:45:30.383]  It's not for humanity.
[02:45:30.383 --> 02:45:32.324]  Alright, let's jump to another caller.
[02:45:32.324 --> 02:45:34.545]  Let's go to Elizabeth in Maryland.
[02:45:34.545 --> 02:45:35.506]  Elizabeth, what's on your mind?
[02:45:36.932 --> 02:45:40.173]  Congratulations to you, Jason, on your film.
[02:45:40.173 --> 02:45:46.094]  This is Elizabeth Border from The Divided Kingdom, the other GCN program that's on in the evenings.
[02:45:46.094 --> 02:45:53.735]  And I really originally called in to talk to Rosalind Peterson about the chemtrails, but it all fits together.
[02:45:53.735 --> 02:46:01.077]  And as Bob knows, I've interviewed him various times, and I have great respect for his incisive mind and his judgment.
[02:46:01.637 --> 02:46:07.958]  And what occurs to me, I'm very glad that you both brought up the Bohemian Grove situation.
[02:46:07.958 --> 02:46:14.680]  And I believe this is really, as Bob said, what lurks at the bottom of the Illuminist ideology.
[02:46:14.680 --> 02:46:16.820]  It really is Satanism.
[02:46:16.820 --> 02:46:25.082]  And I think for that reason, what I wanted to say, I do hope that people, this is not self-serving, I get no money really from this at all.
[02:46:25.082 --> 02:46:28.363]  I hope that people will go to Radio Liberty and get my books.
[02:46:33.371 --> 02:46:37.152]  With much, much more information than weather modification.
[02:46:37.152 --> 02:46:40.392]  Again, I think there's an underbelly to this.
[02:46:40.392 --> 02:47:00.556]  And from my book, one of the little facts that shows all of this as a global plan, there was the fact that the Chemtrail Springs of the Croatian town of Raica, R-Y-I-K-A, Bob, I hope I'm pronouncing that right, but anyway, the springs there started the next day after Croatia entered the Partnership for Peace.
[02:47:01.136 --> 02:47:07.902]  So this writer observing this concluded that NATO is the executive branch of the real chemtrail spraying operation.
[02:47:07.902 --> 02:47:09.783]  And I want to make one other point.
[02:47:09.783 --> 02:47:11.705]  There really are chemtrails.
[02:47:11.705 --> 02:47:19.411]  There is no conspiracy because Dennis Kucinich introduced a bill in 2001 called the Space Preservation Act.
[02:47:21.245 --> 02:47:46.323]  2977 it listed chemtrails as one of the space weapons but you know what happened sometime later as Bob says sometimes these people get messages they've gone too far that word was removed so I want to commend you both for what you're doing and of course Alex Jones for what he's doing I have been following him since June 2nd 2003 that was the first time I ever turned on a
[02:47:46.423 --> 02:47:47.783]  And what do you think, guys?
[02:47:47.783 --> 02:47:55.746]  He was talking about how the elite of the world kill the children, torture them, and so forth and so on.
[02:47:55.746 --> 02:48:01.148]  And from that day on, I knew part of my destiny had to be to speak out against the evil.
[02:48:01.148 --> 02:48:02.408]  So thank you both.
[02:48:02.408 --> 02:48:04.949]  Bob, I hope one day I'll interview you again.
[02:48:04.949 --> 02:48:05.810]  Thank you, Jason.
[02:48:05.810 --> 02:48:07.350]  I look forward to your film.
[02:48:07.350 --> 02:48:07.650]  All right.
[02:48:07.650 --> 02:48:08.791]  Thank you so much, Elizabeth.
[02:48:10.427 --> 02:48:10.887]  We're good to go.
[02:48:32.721 --> 02:48:35.264]  Very, very, very disturbing.
[02:48:35.264 --> 02:48:37.587]  Bob, what is your take on the chemtrail issue?
[02:48:37.587 --> 02:48:39.509]  We had Rosalind Peterson on for an hour.
[02:48:39.509 --> 02:48:48.720]  She is very cautious to not use that word but use weather modification and then the actual metals that are found from this weather modification.
[02:48:48.720 --> 02:48:49.201]  What's your take?
[02:48:50.697 --> 02:49:04.648]  Well, I think that they're using it to influence disease upon people and to control things within our atmosphere, stratosphere.
[02:49:04.648 --> 02:49:08.451]  And I think they've been doing it all over the world.
[02:49:08.451 --> 02:49:16.358]  I travel and you see them in Europe, you see them in South America, Central America, Mexico, Canada.
[02:49:17.762 --> 02:49:23.546]  So, it's a process which is ongoing, and they're not doing it for nothing.
[02:49:23.546 --> 02:49:30.150]  And so, whatever scientists say that they are doing, they are.
[02:49:30.150 --> 02:49:42.038]  No, I agree, and they're just going to keep it under wraps, and keep denying, and keep denying, and then when they reveal, as they're doing partially now, saying it's a NASA program to start, to stop global warming, it'll be to save us.
[02:49:43.468 --> 02:49:46.451]  Even though it's sitting there... After they poisoned it.
[02:49:46.451 --> 02:49:47.712]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:49:47.712 --> 02:50:01.783]  After we've ingested it, and you know, cancer's gone up another thirty-five percent, and respiratory illness has gone up, and our immunity to certain things is no longer there, they'll say, oh, well, we're helping you, because otherwise the planet would be too hot.
[02:50:01.783 --> 02:50:03.944]  By the way, have you paid your carbon credits this month?
[02:50:03.944 --> 02:50:09.549]  It's absolute and complete insanity, total acclimation, and it just shows how easy
[02:50:10.169 --> 02:50:15.213]  It is to trick the American sheeple into just not paying attention and denying its existence.
[02:50:15.213 --> 02:50:23.659]  It's so easy once the main line says, this doesn't exist, for other people to parrot that same line no matter how much evidence is right in your face.
[02:50:23.659 --> 02:50:25.721]  Alright, let's jump to Mark in Oregon.
[02:50:25.721 --> 02:50:27.502]  Mark, what's on your mind?
[02:50:27.502 --> 02:50:28.643]  Hello, Jason and Bob.
[02:50:28.643 --> 02:50:30.024]  How y'all doing today?
[02:50:30.024 --> 02:50:30.965]  Great to speak with you.
[02:50:32.153 --> 02:50:33.355]  Um, Jason?
[02:50:33.355 --> 02:50:34.457]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:50:34.457 --> 02:50:35.579]  Could I wait till the other side?
[02:50:35.579 --> 02:50:37.742]  Well, get out the question and we'll take down the other side.
[02:50:37.742 --> 02:50:38.003]  Go ahead.
[02:50:38.003 --> 02:50:42.130]  Yeah, Schubert speaking this morning kind of was the main theme of the show about the
[02:50:42.941 --> 02:50:47.344]  The danger of nuclear war spreading to this country from Russia.
[02:50:47.344 --> 02:50:55.869]  And what I've seen as far as the Bush administration, their operations have gone flawlessly since the day that they came into power.
[02:50:55.869 --> 02:50:56.790]  Alright, hold that thought.
[02:50:56.790 --> 02:50:57.731]  We'll be back after this.
[02:50:57.731 --> 02:50:58.931]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:50:58.931 --> 02:51:00.072]  I'm Jason Bermas.
[02:51:00.072 --> 02:51:01.093]  Infowars.com.
[02:51:01.093 --> 02:51:01.773]  Prison Planet.
[02:51:01.773 --> 02:51:08.517]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:51:08.517 --> 02:51:10.219]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:51:11.159 --> 02:51:12.700]  But who is the enemy?
[02:51:12.700 --> 02:51:13.500]  Bin Laden.
[02:51:13.500 --> 02:51:14.380]  This is his M.O.
[02:51:14.380 --> 02:51:15.861]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:51:15.861 --> 02:51:17.862]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:51:17.862 --> 02:51:25.005]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:51:25.005 --> 02:51:25.485]  Some U.S.
[02:51:25.485 --> 02:51:31.848]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:51:31.848 --> 02:51:35.289]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:51:35.529 --> 02:51:45.815]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:51:45.815 --> 02:51:47.056]  Fabled enemies.
[02:51:47.056 --> 02:51:54.801]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:51:54.801 --> 02:51:58.163]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:52:01.616 --> 02:52:04.977]  Alabama state code makes it illegal to drive barefoot.
[02:52:04.977 --> 02:52:08.699]  In Downey, California, it's illegal to wash your car in the street.
[02:52:08.699 --> 02:52:12.781]  In Minnesota, you can be fined for displaying that your vehicle is for sale.
[02:52:12.781 --> 02:52:17.483]  These laws are obviously not made to protect us, but instead to help states profit.
[02:52:17.483 --> 02:52:20.284]  The use of red light cameras is another great example.
[02:52:20.284 --> 02:52:25.426]  They intrude on your privacy, are unconstitutional, and cost you valuable time and money.
[02:52:25.906 --> 02:52:32.568]  SprayYourPlate.com is a spray-on photo blocker that protects against red light cameras, toll cameras, and speed cameras.

[02:52:51.316 --> 02:52:53.117]  That's SprayYourPlate.com.
[02:52:53.117 --> 02:52:55.138]  Don't give your money to the state.
[02:52:55.138 --> 02:52:55.758]  Spray your plate!
[02:53:01.670 --> 02:53:10.917]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[02:53:10.917 --> 02:53:19.082]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[02:53:19.082 --> 02:53:23.666]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[02:53:23.666 --> 02:53:26.548]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[02:53:26.548 --> 02:53:31.371]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning and high cholesterol naturally and
[02:53:31.391 --> 02:53:31.711]  I think so.
[02:54:16.879 --> 02:54:19.621]  Alright folks, we're back at the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:19.621 --> 02:54:25.026]  And we had Mark from Oregon on the line saying that the Bush plan has really gone flawlessly.
[02:54:25.026 --> 02:54:27.087]  I'm going to have to get back to that later in the show.
[02:54:28.428 --> 02:54:33.612]  When we take some more calls, and Bob, I gotta thank you and move on because Alex is on the line.
[02:54:33.612 --> 02:54:35.393]  TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:54:35.393 --> 02:54:37.995]  Bob Chapman, you do an amazing job.
[02:54:37.995 --> 02:54:39.376]  You're on here all the time.
[02:54:39.376 --> 02:54:41.717]  Might see you even before the end of the week.
[02:54:41.717 --> 02:54:44.379]  Give out the website one more time, Bob.
[02:54:44.379 --> 02:54:46.500]  TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:54:47.998 --> 02:54:51.079]  TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:54:51.079 --> 02:54:54.320]  Alright, Bob, thank you so much for joining us and we'll be talking to you soon.
[02:54:54.320 --> 02:54:58.661]  Alright, we now have Alex Jones on the line straight from the DNC in Denver.
[02:54:58.661 --> 02:55:02.922]  Remember, we're streaming live video from InfoWars.com right now.
[02:55:02.922 --> 02:55:04.982]  Hey, Alex, what's up?
[02:55:04.982 --> 02:55:09.964]  Hey, I'm at a diner, but we're having to squeeze everything in, so there's a lot of background noise.
[02:55:09.964 --> 02:55:11.284]  Am I transmitting to you well?
[02:55:11.284 --> 02:55:13.025]  Yeah, you sound good.
[02:55:13.025 --> 02:55:14.205]  Okay, here's the deal.
[02:55:15.080 --> 02:55:15.841]  Did you get the word?
[02:55:15.841 --> 02:55:21.326]  Have you made the announcement that we're going to be interviewing Ralph Nader live at three o'clock central when you go into Overdrive?
[02:55:21.326 --> 02:55:24.289]  Well, I said that we would have a special guest, but you just dropped who it was.
[02:55:24.289 --> 02:55:25.269]  Yes.
[02:55:25.269 --> 02:55:27.572]  Okay, good.
[02:55:27.572 --> 02:55:30.054]  Yeah, they called us and said, do you want to interview Ralph Nader?
[02:55:30.054 --> 02:55:37.240]  I've also been invited to the big event tonight with all these folks, perhaps to speak.
[02:55:37.240 --> 02:55:38.221]  I've got to go meet with Nader.
[02:55:39.597 --> 02:55:42.700]  In the next hour, but I didn't even try to get into it, so that's great.
[02:55:42.700 --> 02:55:43.861]  We'll see if that happens.
[02:55:43.861 --> 02:55:50.166]  If so, we're going to have live video feeds for you as long as this system holds up.
[02:55:50.166 --> 02:55:56.751]  The problem is, I continue, when I'm shooting camera, pulling the firewire out of the camera.
[02:55:56.751 --> 02:55:59.873]  We finally discovered that if you wiggle it, it knocks you off live.
[02:55:59.873 --> 02:56:02.175]  But, you know, this technology is in its infancy.
[02:56:02.175 --> 02:56:03.977]  By next year, it'll be the size of a cigarette lighter.
[02:56:03.977 --> 02:56:07.940]  Right now, it's a big laptop and equipment, a bunch of wires and batteries.
[02:56:09.963 --> 02:56:13.749]  We're going to go into overdrive in an hour and five minutes.
[02:56:13.749 --> 02:56:19.157]  I want you to do 30 minutes of overdrive, or however long, Jason, it takes.
[02:56:19.157 --> 02:56:19.438]  Of course.
[02:56:20.712 --> 02:56:22.193]  Uh, for us to continue.
[02:56:22.193 --> 02:56:28.217]  And so, just, you jump in any time, you'll hear us setting up, you'll hear us, you know, right at 2, 210 or so, doing the interview.
[02:56:28.217 --> 02:56:36.001]  I'm gonna have the cell phone open, so John Harmon can fade that up, if the JustinTV Live video feed goes down.
[02:56:36.001 --> 02:56:44.806]  And so, I want you guys, at your discretion, but with John Harmon on his end, I need John to... Well, actually, I know it'll be... We'll be switching from that network, now, to Paul Hartman.
[02:56:44.806 --> 02:56:48.729]  Uh, has Paul, our new IP guy, uh, shown up yet for the, uh, next hour overdrive?
[02:56:48.729 --> 02:56:49.209]  Yeah, he's there.
[02:56:50.103 --> 02:56:53.764]  Okay, yeah, but if you don't have any time, we're strategizing on air here, totally transparent.
[02:56:53.764 --> 02:56:55.045]  Okay, good.
[02:56:55.045 --> 02:56:59.827]  Then, actually, I need him to pull up, or you to pull up, on your computer.
[02:56:59.827 --> 02:57:01.948]  That's why I wish we had the bars out of my laptop in there.
[02:57:01.948 --> 02:57:10.871]  Well, the problem with your laptop, actually, today, Alex, is that I need an administration password to get on it, and I've been using my laptop, so I can't even get on your laptop right now, unless you've got the password.
[02:57:10.871 --> 02:57:13.552]  Well, the password is right there on the main screen when it comes up.
[02:57:14.747 --> 02:57:16.188]  I'll give you the password off air.
[02:57:16.188 --> 02:57:17.089]  Okay, sounds good.
[02:57:17.089 --> 02:57:17.630]  Sounds good.
[02:57:17.630 --> 02:57:18.811]  Oh God, it never ends.
[02:57:18.811 --> 02:57:19.993]  It does never end.
[02:57:19.993 --> 02:57:22.256]  What, there's only one IT guy there right now?
[02:57:22.256 --> 02:57:24.758]  Uh, yeah, Paul's the only one here right now.
[02:57:24.758 --> 02:57:27.502]  Well, if you ask people about that, you can get that fixed.
[02:57:27.502 --> 02:57:30.666]  Okay, well, he just came in 15 minutes ago, so I just gotta make sure.
[02:57:30.666 --> 02:57:32.167]  Okay, well, call the other person.
[02:57:32.167 --> 02:57:32.548]  You got it.
[02:57:34.117 --> 02:57:37.218]  Anyways, the point is here, ladies and gentlemen, you're in the middle of the war room here.
[02:57:37.218 --> 02:57:43.221]  I want you to be fading out the JustinTV live audio feed for folks at InfoWars.com at 3 o'clock Central.
[02:57:43.221 --> 02:57:45.641]  I'm going to go live with Ralph Nader.
[02:57:45.641 --> 02:57:50.623]  You'll also have my cell phone feed there for you to get that as well.
[02:57:50.623 --> 02:57:51.604]  Okay, so you'll have two feeds.
[02:57:51.604 --> 02:57:52.884]  Cell phone.
[02:57:52.884 --> 02:57:58.766]  So I will need you guys to have me on the phone system there queued up.
[02:57:58.766 --> 02:58:00.927]  And I gave these orders earlier, but I don't
[02:58:01.451 --> 02:58:01.792]  We're good to go.
[02:58:11.727 --> 02:58:12.167]  We will be.
[02:58:12.167 --> 02:58:17.771]  In fact, I need the guys to IM me just the number I'm supposed to call in on for backups here.
[02:58:17.771 --> 02:58:22.315]  I'm going to be busy setting up a live shoot, you know, with Ralph Nader for this interview.
[02:58:22.315 --> 02:58:33.542]  So it's going to go out on the radios, it's going to go out on Justin.TV, it's going to go out on PrisonPlanet.TV, it's going to go out everywhere in overdrive, at least 30 minutes of overdrive, with Ralph Nader, with Jason Bermas, there riding shotguns.
[02:58:33.542 --> 02:58:35.164]  So I appreciate you, Jason.
[02:58:35.164 --> 02:58:36.685]  This Michelle Amalga stuff's getting crazy.
[02:58:36.685 --> 02:58:40.848]  Did you see the Inside Edition TV crew live feed?
[02:58:40.848 --> 02:58:41.188]  Not yet.
[02:58:43.772 --> 02:58:46.233]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:51.836 --> 02:59:04.983]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[02:59:04.983 --> 02:59:08.805]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[02:59:09.145 --> 02:59:16.030]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[02:59:16.030 --> 02:59:19.453]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[02:59:19.453 --> 02:59:27.339]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.
[02:59:27.339 --> 02:59:34.524]  Secure your copy of Loose Change Final Cut today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com while you're visiting the online video store.
[02:59:34.824 --> 02:59:42.970]  Be sure to check out the huge discounts on films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, America, Freedom to Fascism, and hundreds of other titles.
[02:59:42.970 --> 02:59:45.612]  We're in a no-holds-barred information war.
[02:59:45.612 --> 02:59:46.173]  Truth is our...
[02:59:47.492 --> 02:59:56.960]  All right, folks, we are locked and loaded live for the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show with Alex Jones right now reporting live from the DNC.
[02:59:56.960 --> 03:00:00.944]  And you cut off with talking about that live feed from Inside Edition.
[03:00:00.944 --> 03:00:02.725]  Now, we were not able to play that.
[03:00:02.725 --> 03:00:03.145]  I haven't.
[03:00:03.145 --> 03:00:06.568]  I've been refreshing my Justin.tv, but I'm getting blurbs here and there.
[03:00:06.568 --> 03:00:09.190]  Why don't you describe it for us, Alex?
[03:00:09.190 --> 03:00:11.693]  Well, we get this call from Inside Edition
[03:00:12.837 --> 03:00:17.962]  This morning, and they said, we want to come over to your condo, the condo we rented for the week, right now.
[03:00:17.962 --> 03:00:21.786]  And so we queue up the tapes, we queue up them pushing us first.
[03:00:21.786 --> 03:00:29.574]  We queue up Malcolm's people, we queue up Malcolm's people posing with us, and then screaming, kill Michelle Malcolm.
[03:00:29.574 --> 03:00:34.960]  We showed them separate media YouTube clips, we're trying, we got it all queued up for them, and they basically didn't want it.
[03:00:35.828 --> 03:00:37.009]  They just didn't want it.
[03:00:37.009 --> 03:00:39.110]  They wanted me screaming at Michelle Malkin.
[03:00:39.110 --> 03:00:42.052]  And then they said, why did you pick on a little sweet lady, basically?
[03:00:42.052 --> 03:00:51.997]  And then they had a lot of live feedback to their satellite truck downstairs, beaming it to New York, where they're going to edit it for the piece that's going to air on the East Coast.
[03:00:51.997 --> 03:00:55.599]  In fact, it's starting to air right now, people to tape Inside Edition.
[03:00:55.599 --> 03:01:00.262]  And I noticed that in the message boards, our listeners have already found the Inside Edition phone number and have been calling them.
[03:01:00.262 --> 03:01:02.223]  And they're saying, oh, we're trying to interview Michelle Malkin.
[03:01:02.223 --> 03:01:03.704]  That was, you know, an hour ago.
[03:01:04.994 --> 03:01:06.715]  But it's just amazing.
[03:01:06.715 --> 03:01:11.736]  Here's this woman calling for concentration camps for American political dissidents, Arabs, Muslims.
[03:01:11.736 --> 03:01:12.576]  Torture's good.
[03:01:12.576 --> 03:01:13.596]  Secret arrest is good.
[03:01:13.596 --> 03:01:17.897]  She said, I'm a liar about the Marines killing a puppy, when it's even admitted that they did kill the puppy.
[03:01:17.897 --> 03:01:19.238]  I mean, it's just that there's no end to her.
[03:01:19.238 --> 03:01:20.098]  It's on video.
[03:01:20.098 --> 03:01:20.778]  Come on.
[03:01:20.778 --> 03:01:22.258]  Well, I mean, we have the whole video.
[03:01:22.258 --> 03:01:23.679]  I came up, it was nice at first.
[03:01:23.679 --> 03:01:25.679]  People got in my face and I pushed them back.
[03:01:25.679 --> 03:01:28.360]  They were bumping into me and they grabbed our camera and assaulted Rob.
[03:01:29.040 --> 03:01:42.511]  And so all of this happened, and it just shows how sick and mentally ill our society is, and even mainline, you know, Inside Edition, Alex Jones, the big bully, is mean to the little sweetie pie, you know, the O'Reilly co-host of the past, Michelle Malkin.
[03:01:42.511 --> 03:01:47.675]  But the good news is, they're still operating in an old paradigm where they can lie, distort, manipulate, and we'll see what happens.
[03:01:47.675 --> 03:01:48.856]  It might be fair, but I don't think so.
[03:01:51.263 --> 03:01:51.763]  It didn't matter.
[03:01:51.763 --> 03:01:53.425]  We were streaming live on the web.
[03:01:53.425 --> 03:01:54.206]  And we even told them that.
[03:01:54.206 --> 03:01:57.749]  It's like they didn't even connect or notice when I walk in the door.
[03:01:57.749 --> 03:01:59.630]  So, that went out there.
[03:01:59.630 --> 03:02:02.633]  In fact, that will post to archives.
[03:02:02.633 --> 03:02:05.075]  On Justin.TV, you click archives.
[03:02:05.075 --> 03:02:07.537]  And you can watch it right there in the archives.
[03:02:07.537 --> 03:02:08.879]  Maybe after Overdrive.
[03:02:08.879 --> 03:02:10.320]  Maybe at 3.30 after the Nader interview.
[03:02:10.320 --> 03:02:12.622]  If you just want to play that out for the listeners.
[03:02:12.622 --> 03:02:14.604]  Or people can go there and watch it for themselves.
[03:02:14.604 --> 03:02:15.985]  But I'm going to let you get back to work.
[03:02:15.985 --> 03:02:16.906]  We're going to dial in.
[03:02:17.954 --> 03:02:21.237]  Uh, to the system phone network in about 15 minutes with cell phones.
[03:02:21.237 --> 03:02:23.339]  We at least have that for the Nader interview.
[03:02:23.339 --> 03:02:27.482]  And, uh, also the Justin TV is going to go live about 10 minutes before we get with Nader.
[03:02:27.482 --> 03:02:33.928]  Before we go, Alex, I want to get your comments on, uh, like MashableGood.com who's saying that you're the one that called for her death.
[03:02:33.928 --> 03:02:36.670]  They're also calling you this ultra-leftist.
[03:02:36.670 --> 03:02:43.656]  And there's this, uh, Australian newspaper here, the Donkey Bray, that's also saying you're an ultra-leftist and you called for her death.
[03:02:43.656 --> 03:02:45.238]  Isn't it convenient how
[03:02:45.758 --> 03:02:50.809]  You know, you go from ultra right wing to ultra left wing all the time when you're not right or left.
[03:02:51.601 --> 03:02:59.405]  Well, we've also found out that these same people were with her the day before the protest, the one that Fox News kept for people flipping her off.
[03:02:59.405 --> 03:03:03.407]  And that they screamed again, kill Michelle Malkin, kill Michelle Malkin.
[03:03:03.407 --> 03:03:08.949]  I mean, these guys, and then when leftists would surround us, they would say, it's Alex Jones, he's a capitalist pig, he's a stooge.
[03:03:08.949 --> 03:03:11.671]  So they were totally manipulating the crowd.
[03:03:11.671 --> 03:03:15.313]  And they would stand behind me screaming Michelle Malkin, Michelle Malkin, while I was talking.
[03:03:15.313 --> 03:03:17.794]  We'll kill Michelle Malkin, and it's all on video, it's all on YouTube.
[03:03:18.614 --> 03:03:22.017]  And it's just absolutely amazing.
[03:03:22.017 --> 03:03:27.221]  But Michelle Malkin did say on Fox Radio yesterday that I did not say, kill Michelle Malkin.
[03:03:27.221 --> 03:03:31.184]  So, you know, that doesn't seem to matter to Inside Edition or anybody else.
[03:03:31.184 --> 03:03:38.409]  But she also tried to equate you with those people that were trying to lift the mint, too, like you were somehow at that thing trying to lift the mint on a little television show.
[03:03:38.409 --> 03:03:39.610]  We're not that idiot.
[03:03:39.610 --> 03:03:45.815]  No, I was there documenting on Recreate 68, does everything to make themselves look like clowns, we're on record saying that.
[03:03:46.576 --> 03:03:51.000]  And we've got them, you know, the anarchists bumping into us and popping us and doing the rest of it.
[03:03:51.000 --> 03:03:52.101]  Yeah, we're doing it right back to them.
[03:03:52.101 --> 03:03:53.862]  I'm not putting up with crap anymore.
[03:03:53.862 --> 03:03:55.103]  And yeah, look, we're under attack.
[03:03:55.103 --> 03:03:55.904]  We're on the front lines.
[03:03:55.904 --> 03:03:56.304]  We're here.
[03:03:56.304 --> 03:03:57.666]  I'm going to throw it back to you.
[03:03:57.666 --> 03:03:59.747]  You might play some of those audio clips again.
[03:03:59.747 --> 03:04:01.429]  But this is a media war, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:04:01.429 --> 03:04:08.175]  You know, the true media, the true alternative media against the establishment and their little doppelganger.
[03:04:09.498 --> 03:04:11.840]  Honey, have you seen the remote?
[03:04:11.840 --> 03:04:14.182]  Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?
[03:04:14.182 --> 03:04:14.962]  I can't find my wallet!
[03:04:35.137 --> 03:04:35.978]  Sound familiar?

[03:05:29.306 --> 03:05:36.080]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:05:36.080 --> 03:05:37.764]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:05:38.709 --> 03:05:40.250]  But who is the enemy?
[03:05:40.250 --> 03:05:41.050]  Bin Laden.
[03:05:41.050 --> 03:05:41.871]  This is his M.O.
[03:05:41.871 --> 03:05:43.411]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:05:43.411 --> 03:05:45.412]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:05:45.412 --> 03:05:52.556]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:05:52.556 --> 03:05:53.036]  Some U.S.
[03:05:53.036 --> 03:05:58.699]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:05:59.399 --> 03:06:02.900]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:06:02.900 --> 03:06:05.981]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[03:06:29.119 --> 03:06:31.642]  Collectors, outdoor enthusiasts, survivalists.
[03:06:31.642 --> 03:06:35.386]  The Army-Navy store from your memory as a child is just that, a memory.
[03:06:35.386 --> 03:06:39.932]  But there is still one place to find everything from gas masks to ammo cans and find it cheap.
[03:06:39.932 --> 03:06:41.554]  MainMilitary.com.
[03:06:41.554 --> 03:06:48.281]  Get hard to find objects like real wool blankets for under $20, canteens for just $2, or trioxane fuel for just $1 a box.
[03:06:48.982 --> 03:06:50.224]  We're good to go.
[03:07:05.000 --> 03:07:05.240]  I think so.
[03:07:33.883 --> 03:07:38.705]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:07:38.705 --> 03:07:40.286]  You want answers?
[03:07:40.286 --> 03:07:41.847]  Well, so does he.
[03:07:41.847 --> 03:07:46.029]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:07:46.029 --> 03:07:50.391]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:07:50.391 --> 03:07:53.692]  Alright, folks, we're back at the Alex Jones Show.
[03:07:53.692 --> 03:07:54.753]  Alex just left us.
[03:07:54.753 --> 03:07:59.495]  Remember, we're going to have overdrive, so you can only get that over at InfoWars.com.
[03:08:00.015 --> 03:08:02.057]  We're going to have a live interview with Ralph Nader.
[03:08:02.057 --> 03:08:03.538]  I'm pretty excited about that.
[03:08:03.538 --> 03:08:10.284]  The refeed at Infowars.com should also be very interesting, after what Paul Craig Roberts had to say today.
[03:08:10.284 --> 03:08:11.465]  Just shocking stuff.
[03:08:11.465 --> 03:08:17.771]  Now we're going to go back to Mark in Oregon, who was saying that he feels that the Bush administration's plans have gone flawlessly.
[03:08:17.771 --> 03:08:19.372]  I'm sorry I had to cut you off there before.
[03:08:19.372 --> 03:08:20.053]  Go ahead, Mark.
[03:08:20.433 --> 03:08:21.715]  That's no problem, Jason.
[03:08:21.715 --> 03:08:26.941]  Hello again, and by the way, you know, thanks for the great energy that you bring to this show and Alex's stand.
[03:08:26.941 --> 03:08:30.405]  I mean, we don't miss anything, and that's saying a lot when Alex is not there.
[03:08:30.405 --> 03:08:30.965]  Well, thanks, man.
[03:08:30.965 --> 03:08:31.786]  I appreciate that.
[03:08:31.786 --> 03:08:32.827]  Yes, sir.
[03:08:32.827 --> 03:08:39.635]  Jason, as I was saying, you know, I've been watching this administration for seven-plus years and very closely, and
[03:08:41.141 --> 03:08:47.009]  I have not seen them fail on one point of their agenda, either domestically or internationally.
[03:08:47.009 --> 03:08:56.242]  And I believe that their agenda has predominantly been to affect this country, to make this country and everything that they've done to make this country look
[03:08:57.926 --> 03:09:12.053]  No, I've always felt that way too, and I'm going to let you continue, but I've always felt that's why today's conversation with Paul Craig Roberts was so shocking to me.
[03:09:12.053 --> 03:09:15.295]  I've always felt like they want to make us into the new Nazi Germany.
[03:09:15.855 --> 03:09:31.905]  And, you know, eventually all this stuff will come out, 9-11, Iraq, Iran, and they will call for a new international tribunal that needs to head these things up and take over, and we'll lose all of our military power, all of our sovereignty, our Constitution, our Bill of Rights.
[03:09:31.905 --> 03:09:34.486]  I mean, that's how I've seen it going.
[03:09:34.486 --> 03:09:35.887]  Paul Craig Roberts seems to disagree.
[03:09:35.887 --> 03:09:37.608]  He thinks we're on the verge of nuclear warfare.
[03:09:37.608 --> 03:09:37.989]  Who knows?
[03:09:37.989 --> 03:09:38.329]  Continue.
[03:09:38.829 --> 03:09:57.525]  Yes, and what you have here is a premise that they have laid out for themselves, I think, from ancient times, essentially, and that has to do with the Phoenician myth about the phoenix who is reborn from the flames of its demise and crash into the earth.
[03:09:57.525 --> 03:10:02.530]  And out of this country's destruction will be born the true phoenix, which is the New World Order.
[03:10:03.733 --> 03:10:09.137]  And it can only be done by the way that they've set their agenda up, by destroying America.
[03:10:09.137 --> 03:10:32.472]  America is fitted into the whole agenda as it stands at this current time, and as it's been laid out over the last century or so in detail, ever since Albert Pike said that there would be three world wars, and that the last war would be between the Muslim religion and the Christian religion, basically, I think, or the Muslim and the Jewish religion.
[03:10:33.613 --> 03:10:53.511]  Uh, so that you actually have things being laid out so far ahead of time, and that the United States plays such a pivotal role to its own great loss, to its own destruction, and that everything that's being done in Russia now that you're concerned about, uh, people name this every day as being in the Bible, in the Old and the New Testament.
[03:10:54.332 --> 03:11:05.090]  And when one looks into the Bible from the Christian perspective, it can very easily be seen that this country is actually the Babylon, Babylon the Great.
[03:11:06.354 --> 03:11:10.756]  It sure seems that way, doesn't it?
[03:11:10.756 --> 03:11:13.978]  It seems like we are at the top of the pyramid, the top of the food chain.
[03:11:13.978 --> 03:11:22.081]  We are more decadent than ever in this country with things like the iPhone, Britney Spears, MTV 1 through 46.
[03:11:22.081 --> 03:11:24.482]  I mean, how many networks does MTV really need, folks?
[03:11:24.482 --> 03:11:26.503]  I thank you for the call, Mark.
[03:11:26.503 --> 03:11:30.965]  You know, I think we've fallen greatly in this country from not only our morality,
[03:11:31.685 --> 03:11:37.109]  But our general humanity, our love for our fellow man, our caring for our neighbor, it's gone.
[03:11:37.109 --> 03:11:48.897]  You know, most people are in this go-get-em attitude, I'm out for me, I'm more concerned about my job, my car, how cool I look, you know, am I fashionable, you know, can I afford this thing?
[03:11:48.897 --> 03:11:56.502]  Meanwhile, banks are failing, houses are being taken, you know, our dollars being devalued on a whole separate level.
[03:11:58.283 --> 03:12:00.284]  You know, I'm not one of these prophecy guys.
[03:12:00.284 --> 03:12:02.265]  I don't talk about the Bible prophecies.
[03:12:02.265 --> 03:12:03.825]  I don't talk about Nostradamus.
[03:12:03.825 --> 03:12:12.388]  I don't even talk about... You know, I talk about people within the last hundred, maybe even two hundred years, that have put it down on paper as a social prediction, you know, through engineering.
[03:12:12.388 --> 03:12:17.090]  But as far as biblical prophecy, I tend to stay away from that stuff, although it is very, very interesting.
[03:12:17.090 --> 03:12:22.732]  And, you know, not only Bible prophecy have I watched, but, you know, Jordan Maxwell's material is great.
[03:12:22.732 --> 03:12:24.313]  I'm a big fan of Anthony J. Hilder.
[03:12:24.954 --> 03:12:29.561]  All these great granddaddies of the new world order, or anti-new world order movement I should say.
[03:12:30.563 --> 03:12:32.925]  I have some great, great info.
[03:12:32.925 --> 03:12:38.650]  Before we jump to Rick in Texas, I want to play my second trailer for Fabled Enemies.
[03:12:38.650 --> 03:12:42.173]  It drops August 31st and it will be available on DVD September 1st.
[03:12:42.173 --> 03:12:45.375]  That's when we're shipping them out, so order them now so we can get them out the door.
[03:12:45.375 --> 03:12:47.517]  And I'm stoked about this film.
[03:12:47.517 --> 03:12:57.905]  It goes over the intelligence ties of the hijackers of Bin Laden, the continuity of government program, the Israeli operatives that were detained that day, and much, much more, including the anthrax attacks.
[03:12:57.905 --> 03:12:58.426]  So take it away!
[03:12:59.258 --> 03:13:07.666]  Fox News has learned that some American terrorism investigators fear certain suspects in the September 11th attacks may have managed to stay ahead of them.
[03:13:08.741 --> 03:13:09.222]  Some U.S.
[03:13:09.222 --> 03:13:15.287]  investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:13:15.287 --> 03:13:22.473]  Whether it's because they're in intelligence services or what they were doing, I will defer to the Department of Justice and the FBI.
[03:13:22.473 --> 03:13:28.739]  There was a report on the George Washington Bridge that there had been a van stopped there that had explosives.
[03:13:28.739 --> 03:13:32.502]  We have a suspect who grew in the van and then exploded.
[03:13:34.930 --> 03:13:39.894]  MDOX Limited, an Israeli-based private telecommunications company.
[03:13:39.894 --> 03:13:46.198]  It is virtually impossible to make a call on normal phones without generating an MDOX record of it.
[03:13:46.198 --> 03:13:51.682]  It quickly unraveled to be the largest foreign spy ring ever uncovered inside the United States.
[03:13:51.682 --> 03:13:52.803]  The largest.
[03:13:52.803 --> 03:14:01.108]  Documents say they, quote, targeted and penetrated military bases, the DEA, FBI, and dozens of other government facilities.
[03:14:01.108 --> 03:14:03.270]  There's one big elephant in the living room.
[03:14:04.577 --> 03:14:09.840]  It is the relationship between the United States of America and the State of Israel.
[03:14:09.840 --> 03:14:13.603]  What about this question of advanced knowledge of what was going to happen on 9-11?
[03:14:13.603 --> 03:14:16.184]  Well, it's very explosive information, obviously.
[03:14:16.184 --> 03:14:18.926]  A bigger question, they say, is how could they not have known?
[03:14:20.908 --> 03:14:26.492]  Fabled Enemies, August 31st on PrisonPlanet.tv, shipping the DVDs September 1st.
[03:14:26.492 --> 03:14:29.113]  Very, very excited about that release.
[03:14:29.113 --> 03:14:33.476]  Remember, if you want to see it on a big screen, come down to New York City, meet myself, meet Alex Jones.
[03:14:33.476 --> 03:14:40.040]  We're going to be playing that and 9-11 Chronicles Truth Rising, another great DVD that's available at the InfoWars.com shop.
[03:14:40.040 --> 03:14:40.781]  Just a ton of stuff.
[03:14:40.781 --> 03:14:45.424]  American Drug War, we touched on, you know, how we've run drugs in this country.
[03:14:45.424 --> 03:14:48.946]  I mean, there's just so much information that you can get
[03:14:49.646 --> 03:14:55.790]  By becoming a PrisonPlanet.TV subscriber or ordering these DVDs from Alex Jones himself at the InfoWars shop.
[03:14:55.790 --> 03:14:57.211]  Alright, let's take a few more callers.
[03:14:57.211 --> 03:14:58.792]  Let's go to Rick in Texas.
[03:14:58.792 --> 03:15:00.633]  Rick, what's on your mind?
[03:15:00.633 --> 03:15:02.054]  Hi, Jason.
[03:15:02.054 --> 03:15:09.018]  First, I want to say thank you because you participate in Loose Change, the second edition.
[03:15:09.018 --> 03:15:11.460]  That's what woke me up a couple of years ago.
[03:15:11.460 --> 03:15:12.200]  Cool.
[03:15:12.200 --> 03:15:18.264]  And I wanted to call in because Bob Chapman made a very important
[03:15:19.355 --> 03:15:21.118]  I don't think so.
[03:15:35.243 --> 03:15:41.507]  And we're not making any money on this, but we want to kick every one of the incumbents out, as many as possible.
[03:15:41.507 --> 03:15:45.670]  Our goal is to kick them all out except for Ron Paul and Dennis Kucinich.
[03:15:45.670 --> 03:15:48.151]  And I would encourage everybody to check us out.
[03:15:48.151 --> 03:15:48.812]  That's about right.
[03:15:48.812 --> 03:15:49.692]  I said that's about right.
[03:15:49.692 --> 03:15:52.514]  Those are about the two guys that I think I might keep in Congress.
[03:15:52.514 --> 03:15:53.835]  So give out that site one more time.
[03:15:54.825 --> 03:16:02.968]  FireCongress.meetup.com and also you can read about our plan at FireCongress.org.
[03:16:02.968 --> 03:16:04.669]  Alright man, thank you so much for the call.
[03:16:04.669 --> 03:16:06.130]  I believe that as well.
[03:16:06.130 --> 03:16:07.850]  We need to get rid of Congress.
[03:16:07.850 --> 03:16:14.813]  You know, Kucinich and Ron Paul seem to be like the only two guys that are standing up for the Constitution, the Bill of Rights.
[03:16:14.813 --> 03:16:16.774]  So I'm with you there, my friend.
[03:16:16.774 --> 03:16:19.035]  Alright, let's jump to Steve in Canada.
[03:16:19.035 --> 03:16:21.796]  Steve, what's on your mind?
[03:16:21.796 --> 03:16:22.656]  You there, Steve?
[03:16:22.656 --> 03:16:23.417]  Yes, I am.
[03:16:23.417 --> 03:16:23.977]  Sorry about that.
[03:16:25.952 --> 03:16:33.338]  The reason I'm calling is that I was escaping reality for a little bit about 10 days ago watching a football game.
[03:16:33.338 --> 03:16:36.440]  We have a professional football league up here in Canada.
[03:16:36.440 --> 03:16:38.382]  It's the CFL.
[03:16:38.382 --> 03:16:39.122]  Yeah.
[03:16:39.122 --> 03:16:44.367]  And watching the Toronto Argonauts and one of their offensive linemen, Ross Weaver,
[03:16:45.197 --> 03:16:51.121]  All of a sudden is being recalled by the NATO Air Force.
[03:16:51.121 --> 03:16:51.461]  Oh man.
[03:16:51.461 --> 03:16:52.202]  Sorry.
[03:16:52.202 --> 03:16:55.324]  And yeah, so they had to let him out of his contract.
[03:16:55.324 --> 03:16:57.706]  He's a missile combat crew commander.
[03:16:57.706 --> 03:17:02.529]  I forget which state he's out of.
[03:17:02.529 --> 03:17:09.213]  Yeah, he handles security for the nuclear missile base in the state that he was in.
[03:17:09.213 --> 03:17:13.937]  And they did an emergency recall on him on August the 12th.
[03:17:14.677 --> 03:17:20.302]  And just so people know, most of the professional Canadian football players are cropped out of the United States.
[03:17:20.302 --> 03:17:24.125]  You know, people that were drafted third round didn't end up in the cut.
[03:17:24.125 --> 03:17:31.392]  And I mean, I remember when Doug Flutie went over, I think it was to the Toronto Argonauts, back in the day, and that's what kind of launched the CFL.
[03:17:31.392 --> 03:17:35.355]  And there was another big running back that never really amounted to anything that went there, too.
[03:17:35.355 --> 03:17:37.537]  Ricky Williams went there a couple years ago.
[03:17:37.537 --> 03:17:40.600]  That's right, I'm talking like 15 years ago when it was first introduced.
[03:17:40.600 --> 03:17:41.721]  We've had a number of
[03:17:42.501 --> 03:17:44.822]  Amazing players that actually started.
[03:17:44.822 --> 03:17:51.223]  I mean, Jeff Garcia won the CFL Championship twice in Calgary before going to the NFL.
[03:17:51.223 --> 03:17:54.904]  So for them to pull these guys, I mean, they're making some decent scratch.
[03:17:54.904 --> 03:18:02.446]  I mean, they're not lavished quite as much as an NFL player, but for him to be pulled to go do military service means that something could be up.
[03:18:02.446 --> 03:18:03.686]  I thank you for the call, Steve.
[03:18:03.686 --> 03:18:04.727]  That is interesting.
[03:18:04.727 --> 03:18:08.748]  And let us talk about football for two minutes on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:18:08.748 --> 03:18:09.368]  Almost unheard of.
[03:18:11.431 --> 03:18:12.191]  All right.
[03:18:12.191 --> 03:18:14.712]  Let us jump to, I think it's Bruce in Connecticut.
[03:18:14.712 --> 03:18:16.133]  What's on your mind, Bruce?
[03:18:16.133 --> 03:18:17.193]  Hey, how's it going?
[03:18:17.193 --> 03:18:18.414]  Good, man.
[03:18:18.414 --> 03:18:20.835]  Thanks to all you guys for putting out the word.
[03:18:20.835 --> 03:18:22.635]  A few things.
[03:18:22.635 --> 03:18:23.315]  I'm 48.
[03:18:23.315 --> 03:18:28.557]  I remember back in the Kent days, and they had all that shit going on with the... I gotta drop you, dude.
[03:18:28.557 --> 03:18:30.698]  You gotta watch your language here on the show, man.
[03:18:30.698 --> 03:18:33.179]  I'm sorry.
[03:18:33.179 --> 03:18:38.721]  Maybe he was talking about Kent State and the students that were shot there.
[03:18:38.721 --> 03:18:39.742]  No excuses, really.
[03:18:39.742 --> 03:18:40.102]  They're just...
[03:18:41.186 --> 03:18:45.629]  The military began firing on students when they were peacefully protesting.
[03:18:45.629 --> 03:19:02.081]  An interesting point that I did want to make was that Michael Rivera was pretty spot on in yesterday's broadcast when he talked about Recreate 68 and the original 68 actually being funded and provocateured by agencies within the United States.
[03:19:02.081 --> 03:19:04.243]  The FBI and CIA, big shocker there.
[03:19:04.243 --> 03:19:05.404]  They incited the riots.
[03:19:06.345 --> 03:19:07.106]  All right?
[03:19:07.106 --> 03:19:09.608]  They would have loved to incite riots this time, but we exposed them.
[03:19:09.608 --> 03:19:10.148]  So what do they do?
[03:19:10.148 --> 03:19:11.790]  They do the next best thing.
[03:19:11.790 --> 03:19:15.473]  They dress everybody up in a goofy magician's outfit.
[03:19:15.473 --> 03:19:19.336]  Mickey Mouse and Fantasia, of course, and say they're going to levitate the mint.
[03:19:19.336 --> 03:19:21.898]  I don't want to be associated with those people, and I know you don't either.
[03:19:21.898 --> 03:19:23.439]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:19:30.504 --> 03:19:32.205]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[03:19:32.205 --> 03:19:32.505]  August 27, 2008.
[03:19:32.505 --> 03:19:33.425]  Gold opened at $828.50.
[03:19:33.425 --> 03:19:37.586]  One ounce gold coins can be purchased for $853.36, $420.58 for half ounce, and $210.29 for quarter ounce.
[03:19:37.586 --> 03:19:38.026]  That's $853.36, $420.58, and $210.29.
[03:19:47.129 --> 03:19:52.751]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[03:19:52.751 --> 03:19:57.073]  treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing the Yan revolution.
[03:19:57.073 --> 03:20:04.996]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[03:20:04.996 --> 03:20:07.397]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[03:20:07.657 --> 03:20:11.480]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[03:20:11.480 --> 03:20:17.766]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.
[03:20:17.766 --> 03:20:21.088]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[03:20:21.088 --> 03:20:24.131]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[03:20:24.131 --> 03:20:24.451]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:20:24.451 --> 03:20:24.791]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:20:24.791 --> 03:20:26.253]  May I have everybody's attention please?
[03:20:35.622 --> 03:20:37.883]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[03:20:37.883 --> 03:20:39.585]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[03:20:39.585 --> 03:20:47.531]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state that wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[03:20:47.531 --> 03:20:55.778]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[03:20:55.778 --> 03:21:00.622]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[03:21:08.508 --> 03:21:11.971]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[03:21:11.971 --> 03:21:14.293]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[03:21:29.856 --> 03:21:33.059]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[03:21:33.059 --> 03:21:43.727]  Did you know that modern technology has devised a barcode that fits inside a tiny microchip that can be placed under the skin of dogs and children to track them everywhere they go?
[03:21:43.727 --> 03:21:53.235]  Did you know they're now working on a chip to place under the skin of human beings that'll let you buy and sell in a global economy without cash, coins, and checks?
[03:21:54.275 --> 03:22:00.559]  It's the coming 666 system called the Mark of the Beast in Revelation chapter 13.
[03:22:00.559 --> 03:22:08.963]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[03:22:58.318 --> 03:23:04.540]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit hempusa.org today.
[03:23:04.540 --> 03:23:09.302]  Hempusa.org believes that now is the time to plan for the future
[03:23:09.582 --> 03:23:10.242]  I don't think so.
[03:23:46.592 --> 03:23:51.837]  Oh, the vampire!
[03:23:51.837 --> 03:23:52.278]  We're back.
[03:23:52.278 --> 03:23:53.719]  It's the Alex Jones Show live.
[03:23:53.719 --> 03:23:56.081]  I am Jason Burmiss, sitting in for Alex all week.
[03:23:56.081 --> 03:24:01.826]  Remember, you can see live video feeds from the DNC right now at InfoWars.com.
[03:24:01.826 --> 03:24:03.267]  It should be very, very lively.
[03:24:04.824 --> 03:24:13.788]  Ralph Nader will be joining us via Justin.TV at InfoWars.com or over the cell line with Alex Jones.
[03:24:13.788 --> 03:24:14.868]  It should be very interesting.
[03:24:14.868 --> 03:24:27.354]  We've shown the clip of Malkin trying to associate Jones with these idiot left-wingers who think that they're going to magically raise the mint and they're going to dress in capes and little hats and have magic wands.
[03:24:27.354 --> 03:24:27.734]  Excellent.
[03:24:28.695 --> 03:24:30.196]  Well, not really, actually.
[03:24:30.196 --> 03:24:42.164]  If you're trying to influence people or show that you have some kind of credibility or you have some kind of a plan or a reason for being there, no, you're just going to get in a robe and act like an idiot.
[03:24:42.164 --> 03:24:45.186]  Alright, we're going to continue to take your calls in this hour.
[03:24:45.186 --> 03:24:47.147]  Let's go to Mary in Florida.
[03:24:47.147 --> 03:24:47.908]  Mary, what's on your mind?
[03:24:49.704 --> 03:24:50.984]  Thank you so much.
[03:24:50.984 --> 03:24:55.585]  Thank you for bringing up that topic, too, because that's exactly what I wanted to talk about.
[03:24:55.585 --> 03:25:06.988]  I think everybody should call Inside Edition, and it's the numbers 212-817-5555, and tell them that they should not spin the story about what happened with Malcolm.
[03:25:06.988 --> 03:25:12.009]  They should tell the truth, that Jones did not, say, kill Malcolm.
[03:25:12.009 --> 03:25:13.389]  That there's video evidence
[03:25:14.181 --> 03:25:21.110]  That those were provocateurs doing that, because there is evidence that he did not say that.
[03:25:21.110 --> 03:25:24.495]  And they're not going to get away with spreading a story, and I think we should tell them that.
[03:25:25.231 --> 03:25:25.631]  Excellent.
[03:25:25.631 --> 03:25:30.116]  I mean, I think that we not only need to do that, but we need to bombard Fox Radio.
[03:25:30.116 --> 03:25:37.782]  You know, a lot of people don't know, but, you know, Hannity's got his own show, O'Reilly's got his own show, Gibson's got his own show, and you've got to get past the screeners.
[03:25:37.782 --> 03:25:42.266]  We don't screen calls on this show, but they often screen calls on that show.
[03:25:42.266 --> 03:25:50.614]  So, act like you're sympathetic towards John McCain or their position until you get on the air, and then you tell the truth until they catch you off guard.
[03:25:52.135 --> 03:25:53.476]  Obviously, obviously.
[03:25:53.476 --> 03:25:58.419]  I feel like you're like a neocon Nazi and then like go all like InfoWars on them.
[03:25:58.419 --> 03:25:59.580]  Exactly, exactly.
[03:25:59.580 --> 03:26:05.844]  That's what Alex Jones does and he did so well at the DNC yesterday in front of MSNBC for 20 minutes.
[03:26:05.844 --> 03:26:08.846]  He took over the show, talked about 9-11 being an inside job.
[03:26:08.846 --> 03:26:14.590]  That message, it's like when your fire alarm goes off, only you can't take out the battery.
[03:26:14.590 --> 03:26:17.732]  You just got to keep hearing the message and he got his website out.
[03:26:17.732 --> 03:26:19.333]  I love Alex Jones's tactics.
[03:26:19.333 --> 03:26:20.274]  Thank you for the call, Mary.
[03:26:20.874 --> 03:26:31.181]  All right, lest we be accused of not taking every call, I have somebody on the line who's calling himself Jim from Planet Zorbia.
[03:26:31.181 --> 03:26:32.662]  Jim, what's on your mind?
[03:26:32.662 --> 03:26:34.484]  Okay, my parents woke me up in 65.
[03:26:34.484 --> 03:26:38.527]  I won't bore you with everything, but I've been watching this ever since.
[03:26:38.527 --> 03:26:40.788]  The New World Order is very old.
[03:26:40.788 --> 03:26:43.870]  They tailor-made their takeovers to every era, country, and economy.
[03:26:43.870 --> 03:26:46.332]  And I have proof, and you can verify it.
[03:26:46.332 --> 03:26:48.033]  Our yuppies are next.
[03:26:48.033 --> 03:26:50.115]  Jason, why did Hitler go after the Jews?
[03:26:51.229 --> 03:26:57.651]  I think it was because they were an easy target for the rest of the population to go after, and he was able to take their wealth at the same time.
[03:26:57.651 --> 03:26:58.291]  Let's hear it.
[03:26:58.291 --> 03:26:58.651]  I have not.
[03:27:20.367 --> 03:27:24.690]  Okay, this will sound unbelievable, but it's true, very intense and very important.
[03:27:24.690 --> 03:27:25.971]  Let me go all the way to the kicker.
[03:27:25.971 --> 03:27:26.611]  Okay.
[03:27:26.611 --> 03:27:31.495]  Any jurisdiction anywhere in the world can adopt this code and enforce it as if it's legitimate.
[03:27:31.495 --> 03:27:34.557]  Some do it with an administrative decree.
[03:27:34.557 --> 03:27:39.200]  Put international property maintenance code in quotes.
[03:27:39.200 --> 03:27:42.523]  Do a search, download the free 2003 version in PDF format.
[03:27:43.283 --> 03:27:45.004]  It is infinitely worse than eminent domain.
[03:27:45.004 --> 03:27:47.126]  It costs money to do the eminent domain trick.
[03:27:47.126 --> 03:27:52.729]  It is extremely lucrative to steal property with the IPMC, and it's happening all over America right now.
[03:27:52.729 --> 03:27:55.471]  I did a program with Gary Brownfield on it one hour, two years ago.
[03:27:55.471 --> 03:27:57.412]  Okay, and one with Pastor Butch DePaul, too.
[03:27:57.412 --> 03:27:58.153]  Here it is.
[03:27:58.153 --> 03:28:01.275]  The code official is the sole interpreter of the code.
[03:28:01.275 --> 03:28:02.856]  Forget due process, there isn't any.
[03:28:02.856 --> 03:28:07.739]  He is investigator, prosecutor, judge, jury, executioner, the sole interpreter.
[03:28:07.819 --> 03:28:11.402]  All right, so give out this code again really slow, because you're a fast talker.
[03:28:11.402 --> 03:28:13.664]  I thank you for the information.
[03:28:13.664 --> 03:28:14.225]  That's all right, man.
[03:28:14.225 --> 03:28:17.428]  I just want my listeners to be able to go check out this code themselves.
[03:28:17.428 --> 03:28:19.269]  Just give out the code one more time for us.
[03:28:19.269 --> 03:28:20.210]  Yes.
[03:28:20.210 --> 03:28:21.591]  I'll give you the website later.
[03:28:21.591 --> 03:28:25.315]  The International Property Maintenance Code.
[03:28:25.315 --> 03:28:28.657]  Get the 2003 version of the International Property Maintenance Code.
[03:28:29.438 --> 03:28:31.120]  And I'll give you a little more later.
[03:28:31.120 --> 03:28:32.701]  Okay, now here's a killer.
[03:28:32.701 --> 03:28:35.784]  Every infraction, there's several killers here, let me go to the cure.
[03:28:35.784 --> 03:28:44.191]  Every infraction is a mandatory misdemeanor, usually in terms of hundreds of dollars and or a month in jail per infraction, and every day the infraction occurs as a separate offense.
[03:28:44.191 --> 03:28:54.420]  Anything the code official says is not in good working order, example, sticky window, loose door, torn window screen, dented gutter, anything he says is not in good working order, every day it exists, separate mandatory misdemeanor.
[03:28:54.420 --> 03:28:55.821]  Alright, I gotta cut you off there.
[03:28:56.582 --> 03:28:57.583]  I thank you for the call, Jim.
[03:28:57.583 --> 03:28:58.643]  I hope people go check that out.
[03:28:58.643 --> 03:29:01.085]  We're going to be taking your calls in the next half hour.
[03:29:01.085 --> 03:29:06.028]  And then, in overdrive, Ralph Nader, only at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:29:19.671 --> 03:29:23.595]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:23.595 --> 03:29:29.761]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:29.761 --> 03:29:36.447]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:29:36.447 --> 03:29:38.129]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:29:39.082 --> 03:29:40.624]  But who is the enemy?
[03:29:40.624 --> 03:29:41.605]  Bin Laden.
[03:29:41.605 --> 03:29:42.426]  This is his M.O.
[03:29:42.426 --> 03:29:43.787]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:29:43.787 --> 03:29:45.789]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:29:45.789 --> 03:29:52.956]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:29:52.956 --> 03:29:53.417]  Some U.S.
[03:29:53.417 --> 03:29:59.083]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:29:59.763 --> 03:30:03.585]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:30:03.585 --> 03:30:06.346]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[03:30:29.440 --> 03:30:32.863]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[03:30:32.863 --> 03:30:35.185]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[03:30:35.185 --> 03:30:38.488]  Tonight, I have a date with the very lovely Rachel.
[03:30:38.488 --> 03:30:45.374]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[03:30:45.374 --> 03:30:47.476]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[03:30:47.976 --> 03:30:51.258]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[03:30:51.258 --> 03:30:56.062]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[03:30:56.062 --> 03:30:59.984]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[03:30:59.984 --> 03:31:01.625]  Travel less, meet online.

[03:31:11.772 --> 03:31:12.213]  We're good.
[03:31:29.475 --> 03:31:33.217]  The pressures of everyday life can deliver a serious blow to your health.
[03:31:33.217 --> 03:31:38.859]  Stress increases blood pressure, potential heart problems, strokes, ulcers, depression, and insomnia.
[03:31:38.859 --> 03:31:42.121]  Stress suppresses your immune system and inhibits weight control.
[03:31:42.121 --> 03:31:44.802]  Stress makes you nervous, anxious, or irritable.
[03:31:44.802 --> 03:31:48.104]  Introducing Nature's Renewal Supreme Anti-Stress Formula.

[03:32:32.273 --> 03:32:38.897]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:32:38.897 --> 03:32:41.879]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:32:47.492 --> 03:32:50.653]  All right, a little Barracuda to bring it up.
[03:32:50.653 --> 03:32:51.513]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:32:51.513 --> 03:32:54.614]  I am Jason Burmas, sitting in for Alex throughout the week.
[03:32:54.614 --> 03:32:56.294]  And remember, Friday we're going to be doing a Best Of.
[03:32:56.294 --> 03:33:06.436]  And on top of just the Best Of, we're also going to be playing some clips that we didn't play during the week that were streamed live over at InfoWars.com through the great service of Justin.tv.
[03:33:06.436 --> 03:33:07.697]  Thank you for that service, guys.
[03:33:07.697 --> 03:33:09.377]  And we're going to be jumping to Ralph Nader.
[03:33:10.117 --> 03:33:17.641]  In a little bit, in the Overdrive, remember you can only get Overdrive at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:33:17.641 --> 03:33:23.243]  PrisonPlanet.tv allows you to see my pretty little face on the video monitor while I talk to all these people.
[03:33:23.243 --> 03:33:25.464]  And, you know, Alex just keeps on expanding.
[03:33:25.464 --> 03:33:27.385]  You know, he's working on a new television network.
[03:33:27.385 --> 03:33:29.186]  I very much want to be a part of that.
[03:33:29.186 --> 03:33:30.546]  I want to be a part of this Infowar.
[03:33:30.546 --> 03:33:31.547]  I want to do the right thing.
[03:33:31.547 --> 03:33:33.208]  I want to try to help humanity.
[03:33:33.208 --> 03:33:38.010]  I want to try to build this country back up based on its constitutional principles.
[03:33:39.258 --> 03:33:43.139]  Does that make me a far leftist or a right-wing radical?
[03:33:43.139 --> 03:33:44.439]  No!
[03:33:44.439 --> 03:33:56.761]  It makes me somebody who believes in this country, who believes in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and checks and balances, in a system where one cannot just declare something and put it into law.
[03:33:56.761 --> 03:33:59.502]  One person can't say, I own that.
[03:33:59.502 --> 03:34:00.782]  It's mine.
[03:34:00.782 --> 03:34:01.542]  I'll do what I want.
[03:34:01.542 --> 03:34:04.423]  But really, that's a lot like what we have.
[03:34:04.423 --> 03:34:05.883]  I mean, even people that try to
[03:34:07.330 --> 03:34:14.713]  Fight, if you will, fight the system and say, I'm not going to give up my farm for the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[03:34:14.713 --> 03:34:26.877]  Well, they often lose, and then they're sued for it, and not only do they not take the unfair amount that's offered by the government, usually between, you know, one-third and one-tenth of the actual value is what's offered, and then if you don't take that,
[03:34:28.038 --> 03:34:29.860]  No, we're gonna sue ya.
[03:34:29.860 --> 03:34:31.841]  And we're just gonna take it anyway.
[03:34:31.841 --> 03:34:35.925]  That should not be allowed, and that's what we've slipped into in this country.
[03:34:35.925 --> 03:34:50.717]  I don't know much about this code that the last caller was talking about, but if it's what I think it is, it could be something as simple as, alright, you have some lawn furniture that's against code, and every day that you have that out there, it would be a separate fine of about $300, so in a week you could rack up a $2,100 bill.
[03:34:52.739 --> 03:34:58.845]  One of the easiest ways for the elitist to control us is to control our monetary funds.
[03:34:58.845 --> 03:35:04.650]  It basically controls what kind of goods and services we can buy and what our standard of living will be.
[03:35:04.650 --> 03:35:06.531]  Alright, let's continue on with callers.
[03:35:06.531 --> 03:35:07.793]  We're going to shoot through them.
[03:35:07.793 --> 03:35:09.454]  Let's go to Brian in Florida.
[03:35:09.454 --> 03:35:10.295]  Brian, what's on your mind?
[03:35:10.936 --> 03:35:11.917]  Hey, Jason.
[03:35:11.917 --> 03:35:15.058]  First of all, I want to thank you as well for your work with Loose Change.
[03:35:15.058 --> 03:35:17.560]  You were instrumental in opening my eyes to a lot of things.
[03:35:17.560 --> 03:35:18.380]  Well, thank you.
[03:35:18.380 --> 03:35:19.981]  So I thank you very much for that.
[03:35:19.981 --> 03:35:27.365]  Listen, Jason, I'm watching TV right now, and I'm watching The Hunt for Red October, and I noticed it had been on quite a few times recently, so...
[03:35:27.985 --> 03:35:41.873]  In light of everything that's going on, your conversation with Paul Craig Roberts, I did a little quick search on my digital system and found 74 different entries with programs pertaining to Russia that are on right now, or in the coming days.
[03:35:41.873 --> 03:35:50.377]  Now, some of them are duplicate entries, but I'd be curious to know, viewers... No, it doesn't seem like it's a coincidence, does it?
[03:35:50.377 --> 03:35:54.539]  And, you know, I've been seeing the Humphrey Redd-October on things like the History Channel lately.
[03:35:54.539 --> 03:35:55.180]  Is that what it's on?
[03:35:55.820 --> 03:35:57.380]  It's on AMC right now.
[03:35:57.380 --> 03:36:11.243]  I'd be curious who's watching Red Dawn on television these days, or Firefox, or anything else like that, and how many times they're being played, and what kind of programs, specifically about Russia, are being played on local cable stations across the country.
[03:36:11.243 --> 03:36:14.243]  Yeah, I would assume that this is the time to gear it up.
[03:36:14.243 --> 03:36:22.885]  I mean, we know after 9-11, they took some of the most famous songs, including John Lennon's Imagine, off the air, because they didn't want people to think about that.
[03:36:24.565 --> 03:36:27.349]  I don't believe that they put this kind of propaganda out there.
[03:36:27.349 --> 03:36:30.554]  I'm not sure, but I think Humphrey Red October is a Tom Clancy novel.
[03:36:30.554 --> 03:36:31.535]  No, I'm sure of it.
[03:36:31.535 --> 03:36:34.600]  It is a Tom Clancy novel.
[03:36:34.600 --> 03:36:38.485]  It involves Jack Ryan before he becomes president in this whole series of novels.
[03:36:39.847 --> 03:36:44.549]  What disturbs me about Clancy is that he does seem to be some sort of a prophet.
[03:36:44.549 --> 03:36:46.930]  Now, do I think that Clancy's in on it?
[03:36:46.930 --> 03:36:47.250]  No.
[03:36:47.250 --> 03:36:50.191]  I think that Clancy talks to a lot of intelligence officials.
[03:36:50.191 --> 03:36:56.233]  Obviously, he writes these books, so he has a pretty good understanding of the military-industrial complex.
[03:36:56.233 --> 03:37:09.698]  And that's why in 2001, when they put out the original Ghost Recon, they were able to predict that Georgia, South Ossetia, and Russia were going to have a conflict in April of 2008, and it was going to be the complete restructuring
[03:37:10.038 --> 03:37:10.799]  Of Russia.
[03:37:10.799 --> 03:37:14.163]  Now, when I got this email, I said, no way.
[03:37:14.163 --> 03:37:20.570]  No way that this game came out seven years ago and that it takes place in 2008 and it mirrors the conflict that's going on.
[03:37:20.570 --> 03:37:23.934]  Also, that that conflict was initiated with U.S.
[03:37:23.934 --> 03:37:25.816]  Special Forces going to aid Georgia.
[03:37:26.792 --> 03:37:29.553]  You know, it's just unbelievable, but it happened, you know?
[03:37:29.553 --> 03:37:37.396]  And this is the same guy who, before 9-11, wrote about a commercial airliner hitting the Capitol and decapitating Congress.
[03:37:37.396 --> 03:37:41.777]  And then, literally within the year, we have commercial airliners hitting buildings.
[03:37:41.777 --> 03:37:44.939]  So, you know, Clancy himself is an interesting subject.
[03:37:44.939 --> 03:37:46.299]  I wish we could get him on the show.
[03:37:46.299 --> 03:37:51.461]  I thank you for the call, Brian, and I'm interested also to know, you know, who's putting this programming out there.
[03:37:51.781 --> 03:37:56.324]  And are we putting it out there now to try to demonize Russia yet again?
[03:37:56.324 --> 03:37:58.406]  To make them, you know, the enemy.
[03:37:58.406 --> 03:38:00.267]  The Red Scare is back.
[03:38:00.267 --> 03:38:01.688]  It's very possible.
[03:38:01.688 --> 03:38:10.995]  I think it's going to be tougher to sell that Red Scare, though, seeing as we just had the Olympics in Beijing, China, and we're trying to act like China's a great nation.
[03:38:10.995 --> 03:38:14.297]  That's a pretty hard act to follow.
[03:38:14.297 --> 03:38:16.679]  Peggy in Pennsylvania, what is on your mind, Peggy?
[03:38:17.406 --> 03:38:21.027]  I need to say a word in defense of the sheeple.
[03:38:21.027 --> 03:38:38.213]  I'm not trying to insult either you or Alex or anybody on the show, but there have been references to the common people of the U.S., the sheeple, and how they're so stupid and all these things.
[03:38:38.213 --> 03:38:41.634]  What I think Alex may not concentrate on is the fact that
[03:38:43.604 --> 03:38:52.430]  And various writers have commented on this in Anthropology and so on, that there's basically two types of people, and they fall into general groups.
[03:38:52.430 --> 03:38:58.335]  One is the people that would be the neocons, and their mindset.
[03:38:58.335 --> 03:39:03.279]  Evil or not, they're very aggressive and masculine-centered.
[03:39:03.279 --> 03:39:07.342]  Even the things they're into, like... A Type A personality as opposed to a Type B.
[03:39:08.605 --> 03:39:11.048]  What I'm talking about is the things that they go for.
[03:39:11.048 --> 03:39:14.251]  They're usually successful in civilized society.
[03:39:14.251 --> 03:39:15.853]  They're real go-getters.
[03:39:15.853 --> 03:39:17.254]  They're doers and shakers.
[03:39:17.254 --> 03:39:23.341]  And then there's the average person who can be very, very intelligent and still not be, quote, successful.
[03:39:23.341 --> 03:39:26.163]  And the majority of the people in the world are the second type.
[03:39:26.957 --> 03:39:34.360]  And if these people are not understood by people who are very aggressive like Alex, then he's not going to reach them.
[03:39:34.360 --> 03:39:35.801]  That's all I'm trying to say.
[03:39:35.801 --> 03:39:38.482]  Alright, well let me just put it to you this way.
[03:39:38.482 --> 03:39:46.525]  I don't necessarily like the term chattel, cattle, sheeple, but that is what they call us in their own documents, in their own UN documents.
[03:39:46.525 --> 03:39:50.587]  That is what we are referred to, and I think that's why Alex uses the term all the time.
[03:39:50.587 --> 03:39:52.227]  I know that's why I use the term.
[03:39:52.227 --> 03:39:53.468]  Personally, I find it disgusting.
[03:39:54.108 --> 03:39:57.811]  However, I do think that we have maybe earned that title.
[03:39:57.811 --> 03:39:58.432]  I'm sorry.
[03:39:58.432 --> 03:40:09.982]  I mean, when your life revolves around 40 hours of television a week, and then, you know, another 60 hours of work a week, and then you're not even... you don't even know what's going on.
[03:40:10.402 --> 03:40:15.585]  In your own country, let alone geopolitics, hey, you might be sheeple, and is it going to get to everybody?
[03:40:15.585 --> 03:40:16.185]  Maybe not.
[03:40:16.185 --> 03:40:18.026]  I mean, but there's other flavors of this.
[03:40:18.026 --> 03:40:19.706]  It's not all about Alex Jones.
[03:40:19.706 --> 03:40:21.527]  It's not all about Jason Burmess.
[03:40:21.527 --> 03:40:23.929]  There's plenty of radio talk show hosts out there.
[03:40:23.929 --> 03:40:31.652]  There's just not plenty of people motivated enough to put out the amount of production that Alex has done and be as successful, and that's why I love his model.
[03:40:31.652 --> 03:40:38.015]  Hey, I'm all for all the other people out there spreading this message who may not use that terminology.
[03:40:38.015 --> 03:40:39.376]  We're not going to wake everybody up.
[03:40:39.616 --> 03:40:48.761]  Hopefully we can wake somebody up, and maybe their approach to waking someone up wakes another person up that wouldn't be as susceptible to, say, a road to tyranny or a martial law.
[03:40:48.761 --> 03:40:54.404]  You know, I just used the terminology they used, and that's how I'm gonna put it.
[03:40:54.404 --> 03:40:56.825]  I mean, are we sheep-like?
[03:40:56.825 --> 03:40:58.967]  Yes, in a lot of ways we are.
[03:41:00.982 --> 03:41:03.404]  I'm guilty too, okay?
[03:41:03.404 --> 03:41:13.112]  I can't wait to get home and be able to take a couple weeks, you know, off and lie down and watch what, you know, the Hollywood propagandists have put out on a big screen television.
[03:41:13.112 --> 03:41:13.672]  I'm guilty.
[03:41:13.672 --> 03:41:15.153]  I want to do that.
[03:41:15.153 --> 03:41:16.074]  I long for it.
[03:41:16.074 --> 03:41:22.719]  I long to sit back and, you know, hang out with my dogs for a couple days and barbecue and just forget about all this stuff.
[03:41:22.719 --> 03:41:25.101]  But that's not my primary deal.
[03:41:25.101 --> 03:41:28.024]  You know, there are a lot of people that that's what their whole life revolves around
[03:41:28.664 --> 03:41:50.692]  Each day, every day, and that's the huge problem, and that's why we have a mass of, you know, brainwashed, mesmerized, hypnotized people that just want to go along to get along, will stand in a four-hour line for an iPhone, and then pay a ridiculous fee, like, I think it's somewhere between like $100 and $200 a month, and you have to sign a two-year contract with them.
[03:41:50.692 --> 03:41:51.152]  I mean, that's...
[03:41:51.932 --> 03:41:53.833]  That's what this society has become.
[03:41:53.833 --> 03:41:55.234]  I thank you for the call, Peggy.
[03:41:55.234 --> 03:42:00.976]  You're always welcome to disagree on this program, and if you tell us you disagree, you go to the head of the line.
[03:42:00.976 --> 03:42:09.140]  Remember, Overdrive is coming up in about 20 minutes with Ralph Nader, going to be broadcast live from Justin.tv.
[03:42:09.140 --> 03:42:11.421]  I'm very excited about that.
[03:42:11.421 --> 03:42:13.042]  Let's continue with your calls.
[03:42:13.042 --> 03:42:15.343]  Let's jump to Dylan in Texas.
[03:42:15.343 --> 03:42:15.923]  Dylan, what's up?
[03:42:17.278 --> 03:42:18.099]  How's it going, man?
[03:42:18.099 --> 03:42:19.279]  Good, man.
[03:42:19.279 --> 03:42:29.126]  Alright, yeah, I wanted to ask if you're aware if anybody's ever confronted that she-devil mountain on that article she wrote.
[03:42:29.126 --> 03:42:30.767]  Ah, I know what you're wondering.
[03:42:30.767 --> 03:42:33.069]  Alright, first let's talk about the article, alright?
[03:42:33.069 --> 03:42:34.750]  And we'll break this down together.
[03:42:34.750 --> 03:42:42.275]  Now, the article she talks about is she actually cops to the fact that, yes, there were weapons found on other planes.
[03:42:42.275 --> 03:42:44.236]  We go over that in Fabled Enemies, okay?
[03:42:44.236 --> 03:42:44.757]  She also
[03:42:45.217 --> 03:42:46.798]  Yeah, it's titled Just Wondering.
[03:42:46.798 --> 03:42:49.719]  A really easy way to find it is just in quotes type in Just Wondering and Michelle Malkin.
[03:43:13.371 --> 03:43:17.033]  That is before she became O'Reilly's co-host, okay?
[03:43:17.033 --> 03:43:21.256]  That's before she got all this national syndication through Fox Radio.
[03:43:21.256 --> 03:43:27.681]  And it really seems that not so far after that article, she totally flipped her position.
[03:43:27.681 --> 03:43:33.584]  And especially years later, when the 9-11 Truth Movement became more prominent, that kind of went into the dustbin, didn't it?
[03:43:36.127 --> 03:43:40.371]  Just to answer your question, I don't know of anybody who's confronted her on that article.
[03:43:40.371 --> 03:43:45.196]  Although, that would be a great topic to call into her radio show with on the fly.
[03:43:45.196 --> 03:43:53.465]  You know, again, make up another topic, and then when you get on the air with her, say, you know, I'd really like to go over this article that you wrote called, Just Wondering, six months after the attacks.
[03:43:53.965 --> 03:43:55.746]  Of 9-11 and see if she hangs up on you.
[03:43:55.746 --> 03:43:58.307]  And if she doesn't, keep on pressing, man.
[03:43:58.307 --> 03:44:00.468]  We've got to use their own ammunition against them.
[03:44:00.468 --> 03:44:03.109]  I think that's why, you know, Loose Change is so successful.
[03:44:03.109 --> 03:44:05.470]  I think that's why Fabled Enemies will be successful.
[03:44:05.470 --> 03:44:13.634]  It's because we show you the mainstream news articles and the mainstream media coverage from Fox, CNN, MSNBC, NBC, CBS.
[03:44:13.634 --> 03:44:17.056]  We don't discriminate that contradicts the official version.
[03:44:17.056 --> 03:44:19.157]  I think that's why these films are powerful.
[03:44:19.157 --> 03:44:19.757]  Do you agree?
[03:44:20.958 --> 03:44:25.921]  Absolutely, man, and I think there's just going to keep getting better and better as more info comes out.
[03:44:25.921 --> 03:44:45.831]  I think the accumulation of data over just the last couple of years, it's, you know, you have X amount after a couple of months, and just, yeah, it's amazing now with everything you've got now from 0-1 to now, and I mean, there's going to continue to be more things coming out, and, you know, by the time you get a sequel out to any of these films, there's just that much more to drive it home.
[03:44:45.831 --> 03:44:48.592]  So, yeah, man, keep up the good work, and do a good job this week.
[03:44:48.792 --> 03:44:49.754]  All right, thanks.
[03:44:49.754 --> 03:44:50.194]  Thanks, Dylan.
[03:44:50.194 --> 03:44:52.478]  I really appreciate the call and the kind words.
[03:44:52.478 --> 03:44:54.321]  Let's jump to Derek in Montana.
[03:44:54.321 --> 03:44:55.143]  Derek, what's on your mind?
[03:44:55.143 --> 03:44:57.807]  Hello?
[03:44:57.807 --> 03:44:58.969]  Yes.
[03:44:58.969 --> 03:45:01.834]  Oh yeah, I wanted to make a comment about chemtrails.
[03:45:02.870 --> 03:45:18.195]  Where I'm living at now, we don't have any, but in Jersey, where I just moved from recently, I'd look up every day and see them, and then it'd be a couple days when you wouldn't see them, and then you'd see a whole bunch the next day.
[03:45:18.195 --> 03:45:27.677]  And literally everybody in the whole neighborhood is just somehow sick a week later at a ridiculous rate around.
[03:45:27.677 --> 03:45:29.358]  Everybody's getting sick.
[03:45:30.405 --> 03:45:35.428]  And it would just rain for three or four days at a time at the seals.
[03:45:35.428 --> 03:45:38.870]  I was wondering if you had any idea about that.
[03:45:38.870 --> 03:45:43.553]  If since they're supposedly also manipulating the weather, does it cause it?
[03:45:43.553 --> 03:45:47.496]  Or they put it in the air and then they make it rain down onto the seals?
[03:45:47.836 --> 03:45:50.118]  Well, how are they dispersing it to the people, in other words?
[03:45:50.118 --> 03:45:52.580]  I mean, are these clouds forming with rain clouds?
[03:45:52.580 --> 03:45:53.040]  Oh, no.
[03:45:53.040 --> 03:45:56.944]  It's not like they flew over and then clouds appeared.
[03:45:56.944 --> 03:46:00.547]  There would just be streams coming from jets overhead.
[03:46:00.547 --> 03:46:00.967]  No, no.
[03:46:00.967 --> 03:46:14.679]  What I'm saying is they would seed the clouds, you would have this big smog, and then actual clouds would come in and it would rain, and people would get sick, probably, from the aluminum, the barium, the magnesium that is contained in these artificial, quote-unquote,
[03:46:15.219 --> 03:46:15.820]  I heard that guy.
[03:46:15.820 --> 03:46:17.561]  I figured I just would call in.
[03:46:17.561 --> 03:46:19.503]  I was trying to call in when she was on.
[03:46:38.543 --> 03:46:46.908]  Yeah, they do get people sick and I can tell you that they seem to only do them in highly populated areas because that was a big city where I'm from.
[03:46:46.908 --> 03:46:50.130]  Now I live in the middle of nowhere and I never see them.
[03:46:50.130 --> 03:46:55.614]  Well, I've got to tell you, I'm in upstate New York, which is about, I don't know, three hours from Manhattan or Jersey.
[03:46:55.614 --> 03:46:58.856]  Actually, it's only about two and a half from the Garden State Parkway.
[03:47:00.057 --> 03:47:05.821]  I mean, although it's a college town, there's a couple colleges here, we have a few thousand people here and there, even when the colleges aren't around.
[03:47:05.821 --> 03:47:15.007]  They spray there all the time, but you may be right, they may not be going into the most rural of areas, but I've seen their program really expand in the last five years.
[03:47:15.007 --> 03:47:16.688]  I thank you for the call, Derek.
[03:47:16.688 --> 03:47:19.850]  All right, let's go to Tom in Pennsylvania.
[03:47:19.850 --> 03:47:21.311]  Tom, what's on your mind?
[03:47:21.311 --> 03:47:22.692]  Hey, Jason, how you doing?
[03:47:22.692 --> 03:47:23.172]  Good, man.
[03:47:23.172 --> 03:47:25.594]  I've got a couple of quickies here for you.
[03:47:28.154 --> 03:47:39.325]  On the spraying, just here in the Fort County area of Philadelphia, in the last couple days, they've been spraying with all kinds of stuff without giving people notice.
[03:47:39.325 --> 03:47:42.869]  Spraying pesticides and that kind of stuff, using airplanes to do it.
[03:47:42.869 --> 03:47:44.811]  So, you know, I'm not going to dwell on that.
[03:47:45.680 --> 03:48:02.728]  But also on the international property code, maintenance code, I served on borough council for eight years, finished up my second term as of January, and the international property maintenance code was one of those things that was adopted by the borough.
[03:48:02.728 --> 03:48:09.672]  I kept fighting against it because it says right in there that the code enforcement guy using this property maintenance code
[03:48:10.678 --> 03:48:12.459]  And who does it give the authority to?
[03:48:12.459 --> 03:48:16.400]  Is it give it to an international body like the United Nations?
[03:48:16.400 --> 03:48:18.040]  Or who is this code under?
[03:48:18.040 --> 03:48:22.841]  Obviously it's under United States law, but if it's an international code, I'm wondering...
[03:48:41.648 --> 03:48:50.210]  And I'm just wondering... Well that's alright, but I'm just wondering, has this code been used in the United States, and if so, where?
[03:49:06.857 --> 03:49:08.018]  Yes.
[03:49:08.018 --> 03:49:12.681]  It's been adopted by most municipalities, at least here in Pennsylvania.
[03:49:12.681 --> 03:49:15.643]  I know a lot of municipalities have adopted it.
[03:49:15.643 --> 03:49:17.044]  Now, I kept it off the books.
[03:49:17.044 --> 03:49:20.067]  They had adopted one back in... It's been around for years, too.
[03:49:20.067 --> 03:49:22.128]  Yeah, he said it was three.
[03:49:22.128 --> 03:49:24.470]  No, it's been around longer than that.
[03:49:24.810 --> 03:49:36.363]  Well, this might have been actually something that Alex Jones covered in America Destroyed by Design back in 97, when he did his first documentary, and showed the expansion of international power, especially that of the UN.
[03:49:36.363 --> 03:49:43.011]  So, you know, he might be a little more... When he was talking about the 03 code, that's the most recent code out.
[03:49:43.522 --> 03:50:02.828]  It's been around since the early 90s, because the downtown used to operate under the old 1990s code, whatever that was, and it took them several years, and I ended up, you know, I would get complaints from constituents, or copies of complaints that they would give me.
[03:50:04.065 --> 03:50:11.230]  And I would call the constituents and tell them, look, this code has not been adopted because they were trying to say that they had adopted the 2003 code.
[03:50:11.230 --> 03:50:13.052]  Basically so they could do whatever they wanted.
[03:50:13.052 --> 03:50:14.493]  I thank you for the call, Tom.
[03:50:14.493 --> 03:50:15.453]  This is very interesting.
[03:50:15.453 --> 03:50:17.175]  Maybe we're going to have to do this whole show.
[03:50:17.175 --> 03:50:18.115]  It's an interesting topic.
[03:50:18.115 --> 03:50:20.237]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:50:20.237 --> 03:50:22.999]  Remember, we'll be back after this and then Overdrive with Ralph Nader.
[03:50:29.602 --> 03:50:31.563]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[03:50:31.563 --> 03:50:35.184]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[03:50:35.184 --> 03:50:37.625]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[03:50:37.625 --> 03:50:40.666]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[03:50:40.666 --> 03:50:46.408]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[03:50:46.408 --> 03:50:50.309]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[03:50:50.649 --> 03:50:55.851]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[03:50:55.851 --> 03:50:58.892]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[03:51:19.779 --> 03:51:21.820]  Join PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:51:21.820 --> 03:51:23.821]  Burn the info bombs to disk.
[03:51:23.821 --> 03:51:25.942]  Put them on the file sharing networks.

[03:51:27.723 --> 03:51:28.464]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[03:51:29.838 --> 03:51:32.721]  Listener, ask yourself, can I be deceived?
[03:51:32.721 --> 03:51:34.803]  Matthew 24 states four times.
[03:51:34.803 --> 03:51:37.125]  In the last days, many will be deceived.
[03:51:37.125 --> 03:51:40.689]  There are many ideas about the mark of the beast and the antichrist.
[03:51:40.689 --> 03:51:44.453]  What do you know about the beast, its mark, and the antichrist?
[03:51:44.453 --> 03:51:48.397]  Is the beast a superpower nation or a giant computer in Belgium?
[03:51:48.397 --> 03:51:50.579]  Is its mark an implanted chip, a tattoo,
[03:51:50.899 --> 03:51:56.644]  The National ID Card, or 666, is the Antichrist a person, title, or both?
[03:51:56.644 --> 03:51:58.565]  Some believe these things are in the future.
[03:51:58.565 --> 03:52:00.547]  Others believe that it's in the past.
[03:52:00.547 --> 03:52:03.830]  1 John states, The Antichrist is already in the world.
[03:52:03.830 --> 03:52:05.992]  What is the truth, and what is a lie?
[03:52:05.992 --> 03:52:08.334]  Are you willing to search God's Word for the truth?
[03:52:08.334 --> 03:52:10.355]  Friends, these answers are in the Bible.
[03:52:10.355 --> 03:52:17.021]  For free books, DVDs, and Bible studies exposing the Antichrist, the Beast, and its mark, write to The Bible Says.
[03:52:17.321 --> 03:52:18.802]  Box 99, Lenore City, Tennessee, 37771.
[03:52:18.802 --> 03:52:19.262]  Or call 888-211-1715.
[03:52:19.262 --> 03:52:19.602]  That's 888-211-1715.
[03:52:29.594 --> 03:52:39.421]  Since the year 2000, earthquakes, heat waves, droughts, tsunamis, floods, fires and hurricanes have killed over 1 million people worldwide and forced tens of millions to go without food and water.
[03:52:39.421 --> 03:52:43.584]  After Katrina, the media was eager to show victims in New Orleans begging for food.
[03:52:43.584 --> 03:52:48.587]  If a disaster strikes you and your loved ones and you have no stored food, you'll be begging as well.
[03:52:48.587 --> 03:52:54.531]  Now our economy is slipping into an abyss that even Donald Trump says will make the Great Depression look like a Sunday picnic.
[03:52:54.531 --> 03:52:55.311]  We're good to go.
[03:53:21.220 --> 03:53:22.963]  Call 1-800-753-1981 and remember, if you wait until you need us, it's too late.
[03:53:22.963 --> 03:53:23.183]  Call now!
[03:53:38.063 --> 03:53:39.063]  It's too bad.
[03:53:39.063 --> 03:53:41.804]  The good guy's lost.
[03:53:41.804 --> 03:53:44.064]  But I ain't gonna lose.
[03:53:44.064 --> 03:53:47.425]  I'm in it to win it, baby.
[03:53:47.425 --> 03:53:51.406]  I'm gonna keep pushing until I win.
[03:53:51.406 --> 03:53:52.206]  Or I'm dead.
[03:53:52.206 --> 03:53:54.086]  Hopefully, I'm looking for the win.
[03:53:54.086 --> 03:53:56.787]  I want to live a very long and fruitful life.
[03:54:06.970 --> 03:54:08.273]  I know you do too out there.
[03:54:08.273 --> 03:54:14.249]  And you know, I'm not trying to insult people when I talk about the sheeple, but man, when we allow...
[03:54:15.714 --> 03:54:19.756]  Not only our nation, but our hearts as human beings.
[03:54:19.756 --> 03:54:25.179]  To get so far away from what is important in life, it's hard to call them anything else.
[03:54:25.179 --> 03:54:27.721]  Alright, I'm going to shoot through these last few callers.
[03:54:27.721 --> 03:54:31.583]  And remember, Overdrive with Alex Jones and Ralph Nader following this.
[03:54:31.583 --> 03:54:34.324]  It's only at InfoWars.com.
[03:54:34.324 --> 03:54:41.509]  And you're going to want to listen if you missed any of the show today, because Paul Craig Roberts in the first hour was just a tremendous, incredible interview.
[03:54:42.742 --> 03:54:44.183]  And I don't think anybody should miss it.
[03:54:44.183 --> 03:54:47.645]  I'm sure they're going to be doing stories at PrisonPlanet.tv and whatnot.
[03:54:47.645 --> 03:54:55.729]  I also want to remind people that Fabled Enemies drops on PrisonPlanet.tv August 31st and it will be available DVD September 1st.
[03:54:55.729 --> 03:54:59.951]  Order it today so that we can ship it out right away and you can get it in that first week of September.
[03:54:59.951 --> 03:55:01.252]  If you can't wait that long,
[03:55:02.065 --> 03:55:08.206]  Or if you're willing to wait that long, actually, you can come down to New York City to the big event, September 10th.
[03:55:08.206 --> 03:55:18.249]  Myself and Alex Jones will be showing Fabled Enemies and Truth Rising, and then of course we'll be down at Ground Zero on September 11th, and there are more events during the weekend following September 11th.
[03:55:18.249 --> 03:55:20.189]  Alright, let's jump to Dick in Denver.
[03:55:20.189 --> 03:55:22.510]  Dick, what's on your mind?
[03:55:22.510 --> 03:55:23.950]  Thank you for taking my call.
[03:55:23.950 --> 03:55:26.031]  A couple things real quick.
[03:55:26.031 --> 03:55:26.351]  One is,
[03:55:27.577 --> 03:55:29.618]  You know, I'm living here in Denver.
[03:55:29.618 --> 03:55:31.759]  My son and I are both big supporters.
[03:55:31.759 --> 03:55:33.500]  We're also kind of big guys.
[03:55:33.500 --> 03:55:40.663]  If you want, I can give you my telephone number up there and you can call me back and we'd be happy to watch Alex's back.
[03:55:40.663 --> 03:55:44.845]  I have standing in the 9-11 Truth Community here in Denver.
[03:55:44.845 --> 03:55:48.587]  I help the We Are Change people deal with their situation.
[03:55:49.327 --> 03:55:53.149]  When they were arrested for passing out DVDs on the 16th Street Mall.
[03:55:53.149 --> 03:56:02.754]  Let's talk about that really quick, because they were actually arrested for being outside of the mall, handing it out, and they said that they were... What was the term that they used?
[03:56:02.754 --> 03:56:06.336]  They arrested them under some kind of ridiculous... They said that they were peddling without a license.
[03:56:06.336 --> 03:56:09.137]  That's right, peddling, and they weren't selling anything, which is ridiculous.
[03:56:09.137 --> 03:56:14.320]  And I actually took the time to call the district sergeant, the desk sergeant for that district,
[03:56:15.598 --> 03:56:16.320]  I think so.
[03:56:25.692 --> 03:56:33.460]  Uh, make it a topic for their agenda at the morning meeting so that they could tell the rest of the officers if you're passing out DVDs.
[03:56:33.460 --> 03:56:35.642]  And, of course, you've seen some of the follow-up.
[03:56:35.642 --> 03:56:42.868]  Mark Silverman from the local ACLU wrote a letter and it was published and there was a follow-up to it.
[03:56:42.868 --> 03:56:45.391]  I'm sure the charges will be dropped and he'll be okay.
[03:56:45.931 --> 03:56:53.595]  But there were a few things that you need to be aware of when you're working on the street, such as not having things that you set down on the sidewalk.
[03:56:53.595 --> 03:57:03.600]  You have to pack everything in a backpack and a couple of the little things so that you can't get, you know, arrested on the technicality of obstructing the sidewalk or that kind of thing.
[03:57:03.600 --> 03:57:09.443]  But my son and I would be more than happy to help with security for Alex.
[03:57:09.443 --> 03:57:13.105]  I'll be happy to give you my phone number out there.
[03:57:13.105 --> 03:57:13.726]  The other thing is
[03:57:14.998 --> 03:57:19.220]  Alright, Dick, I appreciate the perspective and the phone call.
[03:57:19.220 --> 03:57:20.561]  We're going to have to wrap it up here.
[03:57:44.051 --> 03:57:45.291]  Well, we're really not going anywhere.
[03:57:45.291 --> 03:57:49.813]  If you're over at InfoWars.com, we're going to be streaming live.
[03:57:49.813 --> 03:57:54.214]  Remember, Alex Jones, Ralph Nader coming up from the DNC.
[03:57:54.214 --> 03:57:59.416]  And all week, InfoWars.com has the live feeds, making the news!
[03:57:59.416 --> 03:58:01.037]  That's what we're doing in Reporting the Truth.
[03:58:01.037 --> 03:58:02.257]  We'll be back tomorrow.
[03:58:07.944 --> 03:58:11.046]  Good job, Jason.
[03:58:11.046 --> 03:58:14.329]  Alright, Dick, I appreciate the perspective and the phone call.
[03:58:14.329 --> 03:58:16.330]  We're gonna have to wrap it up here.
[03:58:16.330 --> 03:58:17.551]  But we're really not going anywhere.
[03:58:17.551 --> 03:58:26.057]  If you're over at InfoWars.com, we're gonna fade up the phone lines and see if we can hear them in the background right now.
[03:58:26.057 --> 03:58:30.240]  It's breaking up back and forth, but it looks like they're just setting up the interview.
[03:58:30.240 --> 03:58:31.401]  Yes, Jason, can you hear me?
[03:58:31.401 --> 03:58:32.261]  Yes, I can, Alex.
[03:58:32.261 --> 03:58:32.962]  How are you doing out there?
[03:58:33.607 --> 03:58:35.248]  Yeah, we've gotten to the hotel.
[03:58:35.248 --> 03:58:39.131]  We've been messing with a lot of feeds, so now we're up here trying to find his room.
[03:58:39.131 --> 03:58:43.995]  We're bumbling around in this giant double hotel with passages across the road.
[03:58:43.995 --> 03:58:47.158]  Those hotels are two buildings.
[03:58:47.158 --> 03:58:49.439]  So we're running around looking for the room right now.
[03:58:49.439 --> 03:58:52.702]  So just keep talking, and we should be in there in the next five minutes, but we've got to set up.
[03:58:52.702 --> 03:58:56.225]  So probably about 15 after is when we'll be doing this, okay?
[03:58:56.225 --> 03:58:59.127]  Alright, sounds good.
[03:58:59.127 --> 03:59:01.048]  Alright, so we're going to fade that down for the next 15 minutes.
[03:59:03.223 --> 03:59:10.045]  I want to read this mashable blogger lie about Alex Jones right now.
[03:59:10.045 --> 03:59:11.825]  Okay.
[03:59:11.825 --> 03:59:13.446]  This is just ridiculous.
[03:59:13.446 --> 03:59:16.947]  Blogger Michelle Malkin attacked in Denver near DNCOA.
[03:59:16.947 --> 03:59:19.187]  First of all, no one attacked her.
[03:59:19.187 --> 03:59:23.708]  No one physically put their hands on Michelle Malkin.
[03:59:23.708 --> 03:59:25.449]  Michelle Malkin does not make that claim either.
[03:59:27.895 --> 03:59:36.819]  Conservative blogger Michelle Malkin was beset by a horde of self-described leftist anarchists not far from the site of the Democratic National Convention earlier today.
[03:59:36.819 --> 03:59:42.481]  The mob was led by well-known left-wing conspiracy theory radio show host Alex Jones.
[03:59:42.481 --> 03:59:44.982]  Say he's a left-winger, folks.
[03:59:44.982 --> 03:59:49.624]  Of course, we know he is not left-wing whatsoever.
[03:59:49.624 --> 03:59:56.948]  Who was at the protest, and again, he was not at the protest designed to, and I'm not exaggerating at all, levitate the Denver Mint.
[03:59:56.948 --> 03:59:57.028]  No.
[03:59:58.004 --> 04:00:00.865]  First of all, he was walking through the DNC.
[04:00:00.865 --> 04:00:02.945]  He wasn't quote-unquote at the protest.
[04:00:02.945 --> 04:00:04.746]  He didn't surround the Denver Mint.
[04:00:04.746 --> 04:00:07.227]  He didn't try to levitate anything.
[04:00:07.227 --> 04:00:12.368]  He was there to show what morons these guys are.
[04:00:12.368 --> 04:00:18.690]  And how absurd the idea of Recreate 68 is.
[04:00:18.690 --> 04:00:24.811]  Not only did they fail, folks, at inciting the violent riots that they wish to do,
[04:00:27.347 --> 04:00:46.943]  But, unbelievably, they made themselves look ludicrous by dressing up like Mickey Mouse from Fantasia and saying they're going to use their magical powers to get rid of the Denver Mint that prints some of the money in this country.
[04:00:47.975 --> 04:00:50.097]  I hate these anti-capitalists.
[04:00:50.097 --> 04:00:54.602]  I'm not saying we even have true capitalism in America anymore, but I ain't no socialist.
[04:00:54.602 --> 04:00:56.143]  I'm no communist.
[04:00:56.143 --> 04:01:01.209]  I believe that people that work harder and are smarter should make more money.
[04:01:01.209 --> 04:01:04.672]  People with bigger and better ideas.
[04:01:04.672 --> 04:01:05.873]  It's the American Dream, baby!
[04:01:06.926 --> 04:01:12.190]  And I don't think that we should all get the same amount of money and the same amount of rations and live in the same kind of house.
[04:01:12.190 --> 04:01:13.592]  It doesn't work that way.
[04:01:13.592 --> 04:01:15.233]  People are not the same.
[04:01:15.233 --> 04:01:17.295]  Some are not motivated.
[04:01:17.295 --> 04:01:25.282]  Some of you right now are sitting there, unfortunately, with your big old belly, sucking down some chips.
[04:01:26.394 --> 04:01:29.797]  Probably one of those Dunkin Donuts Coolatas.
[04:01:29.797 --> 04:01:32.720]  It's got like 9,000 calories in it.
[04:01:32.720 --> 04:01:34.421]  Just not caring about anything.
[04:01:34.421 --> 04:01:38.065]  Just like, ah, you know, you're informed but you're not going to do anything.
[04:01:38.065 --> 04:01:45.532]  Now there are other people that are listening to this broadcast and they're finding the most interesting information on it and they're writing blogs and they're spreading the truth.
[04:01:45.532 --> 04:01:46.753]  There are yet other people
[04:01:48.032 --> 04:01:57.800]  That are done listening to the broadcast and maybe made some phone calls or went into work and discussed the topics of the day with other people, trying to reach others as human beings.
[04:01:57.800 --> 04:02:06.327]  And yet there are others that maybe today decided to, you know, start their own project, begin their own film, you know, start their own organization.
[04:02:08.006 --> 04:02:10.167]  Or find a way to New York City.
[04:02:10.167 --> 04:02:14.028]  Maybe I just plugged that right now and somebody said, you know what, maybe I am going to go to New York.
[04:02:14.028 --> 04:02:15.229]  I'm going to find a way down there.
[04:02:15.229 --> 04:02:16.789]  I want to talk to these people.
[04:02:16.789 --> 04:02:19.310]  I want to be part of what's going down.
[04:02:19.310 --> 04:02:23.291]  I want to combat the propaganda that the mainstream media keeps pushing on us.
[04:02:25.199 --> 04:02:35.308]  People to know that both Obama and McCain, when they go to New York City for their quote-unquote forum for the family members, are there to grandstand.
[04:02:35.308 --> 04:02:37.130]  They're not there for you and me.
[04:02:37.130 --> 04:02:40.233]  They're not there to promote ideas of freedom.
[04:02:40.233 --> 04:02:45.958]  They're there to take advantage of a situation and have a media highlight.
[04:02:45.958 --> 04:02:47.339]  That's what they're there for.
[04:02:47.339 --> 04:02:50.703]  They're there to further take control of our minds.
[04:02:51.789 --> 04:02:56.990]  And I, you know, I guess I'm taking a lot of heat for using the term sheeple.
[04:02:56.990 --> 04:02:58.251]  And maybe rightfully so.
[04:02:58.251 --> 04:02:58.591]  Who knows?
[04:02:58.591 --> 04:02:59.311]  I'm not perfect.
[04:02:59.311 --> 04:03:00.431]  I'm just a human being.
[04:03:00.431 --> 04:03:02.432]  I'm gonna make mistakes, folks.
[04:03:02.432 --> 04:03:03.012]  You know?
[04:03:03.012 --> 04:03:04.072]  I am no deity.
[04:03:04.072 --> 04:03:05.313]  I don't want you to worship me.
[04:03:05.313 --> 04:03:07.533]  That's another thing that really pisses me off.
[04:03:07.533 --> 04:03:09.214]  When I hear these people say that 9-11 is a cult.
[04:03:09.214 --> 04:03:10.874]  9-11 Truth is a cult.
[04:03:10.874 --> 04:03:11.074]  Really?
[04:03:11.074 --> 04:03:11.194]  Is it?
[04:03:14.031 --> 04:03:19.416]  I forgot I was telling people to worship me or send me money and I'm living in an evangelist's home.
[04:03:19.416 --> 04:03:25.722]  I mean, how ridiculous is it that they try to equate us with like, occultism?
[04:03:25.722 --> 04:03:27.483]  Like a literal cult!
[04:03:27.483 --> 04:03:33.048]  Like we have some kind of leader that we're giving our money to and we dress up in a certain outfit and all.
[04:03:33.048 --> 04:03:40.035]  When we put on an Investigate 9-11 shirt or a 9-11 was an inside job shirt, that's to show our solidarity.
[04:03:40.615 --> 04:03:41.396]  That's at an event.
[04:03:41.396 --> 04:03:42.818]  We don't wear them every day.
[04:03:42.818 --> 04:03:48.085]  You know, we... Man, the cult thing is just... It's gross, man.
[04:03:48.085 --> 04:03:49.146]  All right.
[04:03:49.146 --> 04:03:53.832]  Let's, uh... Let's go back to this article that's just making me nauseous.
[04:03:53.832 --> 04:03:56.636]  The Mob was organized under the banner, Recreate 68.
[04:03:56.636 --> 04:03:57.157]  The Mob.
[04:03:57.157 --> 04:03:58.038]  It wasn't even a mob.
[04:03:58.038 --> 04:03:58.498]  It was a bunch of...
[04:03:59.659 --> 04:04:08.445]  Just jackassery is what that whole thing was, with the goal of reigniting the riots of 1968 around the Chicago Democratic Convention.
[04:04:08.445 --> 04:04:16.131]  And they did try to do it, but they were unsuccessful because of people like Jonathan Elinoff's efforts, and my efforts, and Alex Jones's efforts, and you know.
[04:04:17.219 --> 04:04:18.580]  We exposed him!
[04:04:18.580 --> 04:04:21.802]  Thousands of people didn't want to show up to something that was provocateur.
[04:04:21.802 --> 04:04:26.165]  That was, you know, put there to try to incite violence.
[04:04:26.165 --> 04:04:28.227]  Alright, so here they come lying about Alex again.
[04:04:28.227 --> 04:04:33.891]  Alex Jones is indeed a left-wing blogger with an army of left-wing bloggers under his new media umbrella.
[04:04:35.269 --> 04:04:38.992]  I'm in the office and we're not left-wing.
[04:04:38.992 --> 04:04:40.173]  Aaron ain't left-wing.
[04:04:40.173 --> 04:04:41.755]  I ain't left-wing.
[04:04:41.755 --> 04:04:43.876]  Kurt Nemo ain't left-wing.
[04:04:43.876 --> 04:04:47.259]  Paul and Steve Watson ain't left-wing.
[04:04:47.259 --> 04:04:48.060]  Okay?
[04:04:48.060 --> 04:04:49.781]  Do we sometimes link to the Raw Story?
[04:04:49.781 --> 04:04:49.981]  Sure.
[04:04:49.981 --> 04:04:51.683]  Do we sometimes link to Counterpunch?
[04:04:51.683 --> 04:04:51.883]  Sure.
[04:04:51.883 --> 04:04:54.005]  Do we sometimes link to the Huffington Post?
[04:04:54.005 --> 04:04:55.146]  You bet!
[04:04:55.146 --> 04:04:56.807]  But do we also link to Fox News?
[04:04:56.807 --> 04:04:57.788]  Yes.
[04:04:57.788 --> 04:04:58.248]  CNN?
[04:04:58.248 --> 04:04:58.589]  You bet.
[04:05:01.528 --> 04:05:09.732]  Anything that's telling a speck of the truth, we will link to, we will report on, and it has nothing to do with being left or right.
[04:05:09.732 --> 04:05:27.620]  He is the curator of a number of new media websites, often cited by the left, including, often cited, again, it's always left, left, left, right, right, right, conservative, conservative, liberal, liberal, Republican, Democrat, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, you gotta choose a side, you gotta choose a side, no you don't!
[04:05:28.340 --> 04:05:29.601]  Have to choose one of those sides.
[04:05:29.601 --> 04:05:33.083]  They are false paradigm sides.
[04:05:33.083 --> 04:05:34.124]  Okay?
[04:05:34.124 --> 04:05:39.147]  They are used to try to get you on their team, and the teams are owned by the same guy.
[04:05:39.147 --> 04:05:41.769]  The same guy owns both teams.
[04:05:41.769 --> 04:05:43.470]  Do you get it?
[04:05:43.470 --> 04:05:49.835]  When they compete against each other, it's a joke.
[04:05:49.835 --> 04:05:54.458]  Jones, accompanied by a little more than a handful of protesters that showed up for the event, again,
[04:05:55.575 --> 04:05:59.198]  The protesters were not with Alex Jones.
[04:05:59.198 --> 04:06:06.685]  The people who knew who Alex Jones were could hardly be considered a mob or a handful.
[04:06:06.685 --> 04:06:08.266]  He was with his two camera guys.
[04:06:08.266 --> 04:06:14.292]  And of course, people are going to go up to Alex because he's a radio and TV personality.
[04:06:14.292 --> 04:06:17.034]  These aren't the same people that were trying to lift the mint.
[04:06:17.034 --> 04:06:17.695]  It's ridiculous.
[04:06:19.454 --> 04:06:21.055]  Now here's where it gets into big lies.
[04:06:21.055 --> 04:06:31.800]  Jones, accompanied by a little more than a handful of protesters that showed up for the event, were documented chanting, kill Michelle Malkin, only moments after chanting their previous refrain of love, peace, and justice.
[04:06:31.800 --> 04:06:44.287]  Again, the people that were shouting, kill Michelle Malkin, left with Michelle Malkin, and they were wearing ridiculous outfits, again, had an Obama beret and some other ridiculous hat.
[04:06:45.848 --> 04:06:47.972]  And they're the provocateurs.
[04:06:47.972 --> 04:06:55.386]  And I don't know if they were part of that protest or not, or they're just, you know, well-meaning idiots or morons.
[04:06:55.386 --> 04:06:58.071]  But of course they put their pictures up.
[04:06:59.187 --> 04:07:02.389]  Just totally and completely idiotic.
[04:07:02.389 --> 04:07:18.680]  After shouting orders to his followers to not let Michelle Malkin leave, Alex Jones, in a small mob of protesters followed by a much larger mob of press, harangued and screamed a bevy of personal and ideological attacks for a number of blocks as the diminutive Malkin attempted to calmly flee the scene.
[04:07:19.460 --> 04:07:25.804]  But for a bit of shoving, a lot of yelling, and a number of intimidation tactics, no physical violence directly against Malkin took place.
[04:07:25.804 --> 04:07:32.389]  But as the video captured by Pajamas Media reporters on the scene shows, it could have been a picnic.
[04:07:32.389 --> 04:07:34.370]  It couldn't have been a picnic for Michelle.
[04:07:34.370 --> 04:07:36.432]  Oh, poor Michelle Malkin!
[04:07:37.329 --> 04:07:38.549]  Please.
[04:07:38.549 --> 04:07:39.550]  She's a little demon.
[04:07:39.550 --> 04:07:39.990]  Who cares?
[04:07:39.990 --> 04:07:42.811]  I don't care if she's five foot nothing, a hundred and nothing.
[04:07:42.811 --> 04:07:48.152]  Her mouth is big enough to reach millions of people and tell them that torture is okay.
[04:07:48.152 --> 04:07:51.413]  To keep pressing the fear of the boogeyman.
[04:07:51.413 --> 04:07:55.514]  To promote martial law and internment camps for Americans.
[04:07:55.514 --> 04:08:03.137]  To give a free pass to soldiers whether or not they're killing innocent civilians over there or animals.
[04:08:03.137 --> 04:08:03.677]  Give me a break.
[04:08:04.617 --> 04:08:06.458]  Oh, poor Michelle Malkin.
[04:08:06.458 --> 04:08:09.561]  I feel so bad for her.
[04:08:09.561 --> 04:08:20.408]  What's most irritating is that, once again, tactics that originate from left-wing bloggers have bled into meat space and painted a picture that puts the new media in a poor light.
[04:08:20.408 --> 04:08:21.249]  Come on!
[04:08:22.225 --> 04:08:24.866]  Left-wing, left-wing, we're not left-wing.
[04:08:24.866 --> 04:08:28.607]  I think they probably used the term left-wing about four more times in this short article.
[04:08:28.607 --> 04:08:34.149]  Of course, I'm referring to the lousy vetting process that was in place during the Republican primary YouTube debates.
[04:08:34.149 --> 04:08:47.213]  It was discovered during the broadcast of the show that one of the questionnaires was a plant from one of the Democratic campaigns, and a careful analysis of the rest of the bunch showed up that almost half of the questionnaires were Democratic plants, staffers, organizers, or bloggers.
[04:08:47.213 --> 04:08:48.193]  No shock there.
[04:08:48.193 --> 04:08:49.794]  Same thing goes on with your right-wing guy.
[04:08:51.237 --> 04:08:53.958]  That might be the one thing he got right in this article.
[04:08:53.958 --> 04:09:01.442]  But again, it's all about attacking the other side, so maybe that would be the only part that has to actually be right.
[04:09:01.442 --> 04:09:03.123]  Let's jump down a little bit.
[04:09:03.123 --> 04:09:10.927]  Interestingly, it seems that despite being present for the threats, the Denver police took no action against Alex Jones or any of the other protesters calling for the death of Ms.
[04:09:10.927 --> 04:09:11.327]  Malkin.
[04:09:11.327 --> 04:09:15.470]  Again, Alex Jones did not call for the death of Michelle Malkin!
[04:09:15.470 --> 04:09:16.150]  It's clear!
[04:09:16.150 --> 04:09:17.130]  It's on video!
[04:09:17.130 --> 04:09:17.791]  Give me a break!
[04:09:19.386 --> 04:09:22.248]  Of course, why would the police arrest him?
[04:09:22.248 --> 04:09:24.870]  He walked up and started making a statement.
[04:09:24.870 --> 04:09:26.031]  She's a public figure.
[04:09:26.031 --> 04:09:27.392]  She's on the news.
[04:09:27.392 --> 04:09:28.452]  She spreads her lies.
[04:09:28.452 --> 04:09:30.534]  She's an author.
[04:09:30.534 --> 04:09:33.756]  He has every right to go up to her and exercise his free speech.
[04:09:36.341 --> 04:09:36.961]  Oh, man.
[04:09:36.961 --> 04:09:46.808]  Instead of taking the position of some of the liberals in the blogosphere, the best move for Democratic-aligned bloggers would be to immediately denounce the actions of Alex Jones.
[04:09:46.808 --> 04:09:49.450]  So Democrats, don't link to Alex.
[04:09:49.450 --> 04:09:51.732]  That's the next message.
[04:09:51.732 --> 04:10:02.640]  Let's shred it into two sides, right and left, Republican and Democrat, and then encourage the Democrats not to go to Jones whatsoever.
[04:10:02.640 --> 04:10:03.000]  Interesting.
[04:10:05.835 --> 04:10:09.679]  The actions of Alex Jones, of course the right will denounce Jones and company.
[04:10:09.679 --> 04:10:11.320]  No they won't!
[04:10:11.320 --> 04:10:19.368]  No, your little fake right-wing Minions, your O'Reilly's, your Hannity's, your Limbaugh's.
[04:10:19.368 --> 04:10:21.790]  Yeah, they'll denounce Alex Jones or they won't bring it up at all.
[04:10:21.790 --> 04:10:23.612]  Good for them.
[04:10:23.612 --> 04:10:25.074]  Do we have Alex coming in now?
[04:10:25.074 --> 04:10:30.519]  Is that what... Okay, I guess that we're gonna go to the JustinTV feed right now.
[04:10:32.000 --> 04:10:37.443]  Yep, and we'll pull it up and we'll see if this interview has started.
[04:10:37.443 --> 04:10:50.369]  Again, you can see this over at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and hopefully in about three minutes we're going to have the Nader interview live for you.
[04:10:50.369 --> 04:10:52.751]  Revolutionary radio, folks.
[04:10:52.751 --> 04:10:55.832]  And Alex Jones has really made the most of it.
[04:10:55.832 --> 04:10:59.234]  Hopefully Inside Edition's piece will not be a total hit brigade, but
[04:11:00.780 --> 04:11:08.804]  I don't have too much confidence in the mainstream media, and I know most of you listeners out there also do not have too much confidence in the mainstream media.
[04:11:08.804 --> 04:11:11.926]  Not that they've earned it.
[04:11:11.926 --> 04:11:16.228]  And of course, the end line of this terrible, terrible, liable article.
[04:11:16.228 --> 04:11:18.869]  And it is liable, by the way.
[04:11:18.869 --> 04:11:27.834]  Those that use Jones's sources on a regular basis would do good to distance themselves from this sort of ridiculous behavior or risk being painted with the same brush.
[04:11:30.014 --> 04:11:31.495]  And what brush might that be?
[04:11:31.495 --> 04:11:33.256]  The brush of freedom?
[04:11:33.256 --> 04:11:36.938]  The, uh, brush of democracy?
[04:11:36.938 --> 04:11:39.580]  The brush of a constitutional republic?
[04:11:39.580 --> 04:11:41.581]  The brush of free speech?
[04:11:41.581 --> 04:11:46.024]  The brush of new media taking over the corporate-controlled media?
[04:11:46.024 --> 04:11:51.188]  And I'm sick of the bullcrap that this is somehow new media that she's with.
[04:11:51.188 --> 04:11:52.609]  Pajamas media.
[04:11:52.609 --> 04:11:54.770]  BLEUGH!
[04:11:54.770 --> 04:11:56.791]  Go to bed, pajamas, please.
[04:11:56.791 --> 04:11:57.572]  It's absolutely
[04:11:58.903 --> 04:12:00.665]  Unbelievably disgusting.
[04:12:00.665 --> 04:12:13.601]  See, what they're doing is they're trying to have their little sub-sex of neocon worshippers, probably what those two little anarchists, your fake anarchists, were, you know, their little provocateurs, they think it's funny.
[04:12:13.601 --> 04:12:16.604]  And it is just, it's beyond disturbing to me.
[04:12:16.604 --> 04:12:19.007]  Beyond disturbing.
[04:12:22.315 --> 04:12:31.380]  That these sickos are going to present like these other blogs that are, you know, little green footballs and all these other... Ugh.
[04:12:31.380 --> 04:12:32.141]  God.
[04:12:32.141 --> 04:12:34.862]  I just... I'm getting sick.
[04:12:34.862 --> 04:12:40.485]  They just sit there and they rant about how great the neocons are.
[04:12:40.485 --> 04:12:43.727]  And how we just need to go and kill everybody.
[04:12:43.727 --> 04:12:49.871]  And everything that George Bush and his administration have done is the best thing since breakfast and Dick Cheney is a hero.
[04:12:49.871 --> 04:12:50.171]  And you know,
[04:12:51.634 --> 04:12:54.315]  What's going on with this Karl Rove situation?
[04:12:54.315 --> 04:12:55.295]  I'm not quite sure.
[04:12:55.295 --> 04:12:57.756]  I know that he left the country on subpoena.
[04:12:57.756 --> 04:12:58.876]  He's obviously back.
[04:12:58.876 --> 04:13:07.298]  I saw him on O'Reilly last night at the DNC, proving once again that these people are above the law.
[04:13:07.298 --> 04:13:09.818]  It's just like when Libby gets convicted.
[04:13:09.818 --> 04:13:11.759]  Convicted!
[04:13:11.759 --> 04:13:15.520]  In a court of law of releasing the name of Valerie Plame.
[04:13:16.585 --> 04:13:33.016]  And, you know, helping in this, you know, really rather minor conspiracy to try to discredit Plame and her claims against the uranium, the enriched uranium in Niger, which was completely and totally false, of course.
[04:13:33.016 --> 04:13:37.639]  So, he gets jail time, okay?
[04:13:37.639 --> 04:13:41.381]  Most of the jurors know that Cheney is involved also.
[04:13:41.381 --> 04:13:42.922]  What happens?
[04:13:42.922 --> 04:13:44.203]  George Bush commutes his sentence.
[04:13:44.203 --> 04:13:45.564]  He doesn't even wait for
[04:13:47.276 --> 04:13:48.978]  And we know Clinton did it with many a people.
[04:14:09.841 --> 04:14:27.410]  Bush is going to do it with many people, but that's how transparent the evil is, that they can do this in public, in your face, on television, for all to see, and still, you know, still, nothing is done.
[04:14:27.410 --> 04:14:31.112]  Rove still parades around like he's some kind of hero.
[04:14:31.112 --> 04:14:31.853]  He goes on TV.
[04:14:34.847 --> 04:14:41.595]  It's outlandish, it's unacceptable, and it should be infuriating to all the listeners out there.
[04:14:41.595 --> 04:14:46.161]  You should literally have your fist clenched like this and have it beat red and beam.
[04:14:46.161 --> 04:14:47.903]  Why are we taking this?
[04:14:47.903 --> 04:14:50.166]  What the hell is going on?
[04:14:50.166 --> 04:14:51.728]  But you're not.
[04:14:51.728 --> 04:14:53.450]  You're sitting back.
[04:14:53.450 --> 04:14:54.151]  You're relaxing.
[04:14:55.011 --> 04:14:56.832]  And you're like, oh, this is really scary.
[04:14:56.832 --> 04:14:57.773]  I don't know if I can do it.
[04:14:57.773 --> 04:14:58.774]  Okay, are we good?
[04:14:58.774 --> 04:15:06.139]  Okay, it seems that I'm going to be able to fade the phone line up right now, and we're going to get to... No, we're looking for the Justin.TV feed?
[04:15:06.139 --> 04:15:08.100]  Alright, well, I'm still not getting it.
[04:15:08.100 --> 04:15:09.121]  At all.
[04:15:09.121 --> 04:15:13.724]  Okay, so as soon as I have the Justin.TV feed, we will go to it.
[04:15:13.724 --> 04:15:16.246]  It is not working for some reason.
[04:15:16.246 --> 04:15:17.987]  I'm going to try to restart my Firefox.
[04:15:19.229 --> 04:15:20.610]  Yes, I am on 1360 North of Denver.
[04:15:20.610 --> 04:15:22.212]  The Lion is the station that carries it here.
[04:15:22.212 --> 04:15:22.932]  We only have about 65 stations.
[04:15:22.932 --> 04:15:24.294]  It sounds like a lot, but it's not that many.
[04:15:37.694 --> 04:15:38.675]  We're live on the radio.
[04:15:38.675 --> 04:15:41.036]  That feed over a wireless card is sending video out.
[04:15:41.036 --> 04:15:42.898]  It's unimportant.
[04:15:42.898 --> 04:15:43.318]  Yes, sir.
[04:15:43.318 --> 04:15:43.758]  Well, yes.
[04:15:43.758 --> 04:15:45.439]  I mean, they're waiting to go live.
[04:15:45.439 --> 04:15:46.460]  People on the web are watching live.
[04:15:46.460 --> 04:15:50.203]  We're going to go live on the radio show in just a moment.
[04:15:50.203 --> 04:15:52.024]  Mr. Nader, it's really great to speak with you.
[04:15:52.024 --> 04:15:52.885]  We're live.
[04:15:52.885 --> 04:15:53.545]  Thank you, Alex.
[04:15:53.545 --> 04:15:55.026]  Thanks for taking ten minutes out of our time.
[04:15:55.026 --> 04:15:58.809]  I see you've got media lined up down the hall here to talk to you.
[04:15:58.809 --> 04:16:06.074]  I've looked at the two candidates, Barack Obama and, of course, John McCain, and I really don't see a lot of differences
[04:16:06.904 --> 04:16:11.968]  Can you compare yourself to both John McCain and to, of course, Barack Obama?
[04:16:37.341 --> 04:16:39.761]  And you are a defense contractor.
[04:16:39.761 --> 04:16:40.842]  And he's president.
[04:16:40.842 --> 04:16:41.722]  Watch out.
[04:16:41.722 --> 04:16:44.282]  It doesn't matter what the other Republicans will say.
[04:16:44.282 --> 04:16:50.883]  Just the way he went out after that Boeing tanker $19 billion deal as senator.
[04:16:50.883 --> 04:17:00.565]  Barack Obama, if he becomes president, he's going to have a harder time saying no to African Americans, poor, hot whites, and Latinos.
[04:17:00.565 --> 04:17:00.845]  Why?
[04:17:00.845 --> 04:17:04.966]  Because they're going to say, hey, you're supposed to represent our interests.
[04:17:05.356 --> 04:17:08.737]  You becoming president is not just another career move, you know?
[04:17:08.737 --> 04:17:10.898]  It's supposed to make a difference.
[04:17:10.898 --> 04:17:17.801]  With McCain, you're going to get a perpetual war candidate.
[04:17:17.801 --> 04:17:26.985]  I don't know where he got his aggressiveness and his militarism, given his experiences in Vietnam, but it's demeaning to him.
[04:17:26.985 --> 04:17:35.028]  And I think he's got to come forward with the same kind of fervor and waging peace and putting forth the humanitarian
[04:17:35.690 --> 04:17:40.083]  Uh, face of America, which is the best way to prevent trouble.
[04:17:40.083 --> 04:17:42.631]  Well, comparing yourself to Barack Obama...
[04:17:43.672 --> 04:17:47.615]  He said that he was going to basically pull us out of Iraq.
[04:17:47.615 --> 04:17:49.696]  Now he's said that we're going to be staying there a while.
[04:17:49.696 --> 04:17:54.140]  He's talking about going into Afghanistan, increasing the troops, Pakistan.
[04:17:54.140 --> 04:17:58.263]  He voted for the warrantless wiretaps of American people.
[04:17:58.263 --> 04:18:06.128]  What would you do if you were president with the warrantless wiretaps, with the rendition, Guantanamo Bay, all the horrible police state developments we've seen, sir?
[04:18:06.128 --> 04:18:07.209]  I would stop the war crime.
[04:18:07.782 --> 04:18:09.163]  That's what he has to face.
[04:18:09.163 --> 04:18:17.206]  How, if he becomes president, is he going to stop the continuation of Bush-Cheney's war crimes and the violation of our Constitution?
[04:18:17.206 --> 04:18:20.347]  That means no wiretapping without judicial approval.
[04:18:20.347 --> 04:18:24.469]  You can get it very quickly and retroactively with the FISA Court.
[04:18:24.469 --> 04:18:28.851]  That is a violation of federal law without a judicial warrant.
[04:18:28.851 --> 04:18:31.812]  You know, it carries a maximum five-year jail term.
[04:18:31.812 --> 04:18:35.554]  That means do not head into the hottest, hottest
[04:18:35.936 --> 04:18:42.379]  Cornets nest in the world, which are the mountains of Afghanistan and Pakistan, with our soldiers.
[04:18:42.379 --> 04:18:44.440]  No one has ever conquered that area.
[04:18:44.440 --> 04:18:50.562]  The British tried, the Russians tried under the Soviet era, and we're not going to be able to do it.
[04:18:50.562 --> 04:18:54.884]  And the third is, withdrawing from Iraq but leaving 50,000 soldiers there?
[04:18:54.884 --> 04:18:57.465]  And leaving military bases there?
[04:18:57.465 --> 04:18:59.786]  How's that going to knock the bottom out of the insurgency?
[04:18:59.786 --> 04:19:01.307]  Well, that's doublespeak, isn't it?
[04:19:01.307 --> 04:19:02.867]  Of course it's doublespeak.
[04:19:02.867 --> 04:19:04.428]  And it's military aid bases, he said.
[04:19:05.004 --> 04:19:12.408]  There'll be 50 to 80,000 soldiers there, and the corporate contractors will stay there because they're maintaining the military bases.
[04:19:12.408 --> 04:19:15.329]  Halliburton, KBR, Blackwater.
[04:19:15.329 --> 04:19:21.232]  I think Barack Obama is trying to talk out of both sides of his mouth.
[04:19:21.232 --> 04:19:23.954]  Mr. Nader, you've run for president before.
[04:19:23.954 --> 04:19:25.835]  Why are you running for president again?
[04:19:25.835 --> 04:19:29.257]  You know, the control corporate press says, oh, the perennial candidate.
[04:19:29.257 --> 04:19:30.877]  Why are you running for president?
[04:19:30.877 --> 04:19:32.658]  Because I want to improve my country.
[04:19:32.658 --> 04:19:33.939]  I want to help the American people.
[04:19:34.508 --> 04:19:52.409]  I want to take the solutions off the shelf, which are great solutions to affordable housing, public transit, pollution cleanup, solar energy, and put them on the ground and give the American people more small business, more entrepreneurship, more rights as workers, and the freedom to form trade unions.
[04:19:52.938 --> 04:19:57.421]  And to put our foot forward in the world where the best of America is seen.
[04:19:57.421 --> 04:20:08.367]  Not napalm, cluster bombs to the Israelis, and more weapons of mass destruction sold to countries that are often run by dictators who use these weapons against their own people.
[04:20:08.367 --> 04:20:11.389]  And we wonder why people in the third world hate us?
[04:20:11.389 --> 04:20:12.910]  Well, we're glad that you're running for president.
[04:20:12.910 --> 04:20:15.731]  I know a lot of the viewers and listeners out there as well.
[04:20:15.731 --> 04:20:16.612]  And you look at the polls.
[04:20:17.032 --> 04:20:30.496]  You see, Congress with its lowest approval rating in history, Gallup Poll reported 9%, Cheney's got a 9%, Bush a 22%, the Democrats are unpopular, because you have the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the American people are all together on what they want.
[04:20:30.496 --> 04:20:41.720]  It's funny, constitutional positions happen to be very popular with the people, but we have the two-party dictatorship going forward, and certainly, by running, you are helping to inject real issues
[04:20:42.060 --> 04:20:51.994]  Alex Jones, you're one of the few radio talk shows that ever says what you just said.
[04:20:51.994 --> 04:20:56.140]  What you are saying is, let many voices be heard.
[04:20:56.140 --> 04:20:59.204]  Let the First Amendment be used by all Americans.
[04:20:59.688 --> 04:21:01.450]  Open up the debate process.
[04:21:01.450 --> 04:21:03.151]  Why are we limiting presidential debates?
[04:21:03.151 --> 04:21:04.752]  We don't limit weather reports.
[04:21:04.752 --> 04:21:06.354]  We don't limit entertainment.
[04:21:06.354 --> 04:21:07.354]  We don't limit sports.
[04:21:07.354 --> 04:21:09.056]  That was my next question.
[04:21:09.056 --> 04:21:15.141]  You are really here to bring attention to the fact that we have this corporate monopoly that's hijacked the public trust for debates.
[04:21:15.141 --> 04:21:20.005]  Can you speak with your particular expertise at that, being locked out of debates that you were invited to?
[04:21:20.005 --> 04:21:29.012]  Even though national poll after national poll from 2001 had me on the debate, Buchanan on the debate, they want more people on the stage than, you know,
[04:21:30.188 --> 04:21:38.070]  Two major candidates that are basically spouting the same old slogans that they spouted weeks before on the campaign trail.
[04:21:38.070 --> 04:21:39.050]  They're not really debates.
[04:21:39.050 --> 04:21:40.670]  They're parallel interviews.
[04:21:40.670 --> 04:21:49.733]  And the Debate Commission is a private company created 21 years ago to get rid of the League of Women Voters, which sponsored debate, controlled by the Republican-Democrat Party.
[04:21:49.733 --> 04:21:52.633]  To this day, they pick the format of the debate.
[04:21:52.633 --> 04:21:55.854]  They pick the reporters who will ask the questions.
[04:21:55.854 --> 04:21:57.955]  And naturally, they know how to pick and dump.
[04:21:57.955 --> 04:21:59.535]  Well, it seems they're more scared of
[04:22:00.538 --> 04:22:08.923]  Letting a third party or an individual like yourself, you know, who has the gravitas and the history, you know, to really challenge it again, because more than ever, the Kibari system is under threat.
[04:22:08.923 --> 04:22:19.869]  They know the people are wising up to them, so there's no way they can let Ralph Nader in there, because if they did, you could capture the minds of the people, uh, and, you know, capture their attention and their imagination, and then we could actually get some change in this country.
[04:22:19.869 --> 04:22:23.111]  Nader Gonzales would run the three major presidential bays, Alex.
[04:22:23.111 --> 04:22:24.212]  It would be a three-way race.
[04:22:25.066 --> 04:22:46.059]  The CNN poll has us at 6%, and we would go up quite rapidly with tens of millions of people finding out that we're actually running, finding out what we're running on, finding out that our rhetoric is based on a record of challenging the big boys for 40 years for the health, safety, and economic well-being of the American people.
[04:22:46.059 --> 04:22:52.183]  That's the Nader Gonzalez ticket, and that's the theme of our Super Rally during the Democrat National Convention Week.
[04:22:52.643 --> 04:22:53.765]  In Denver.
[04:23:09.766 --> 04:23:12.827]  Ike O'Reilly, Sean Penn, and so many others.
[04:23:12.827 --> 04:23:15.187]  Tom Moreau, a great defensive machine.
[04:23:15.187 --> 04:23:15.667]  Absolutely.
[04:23:15.667 --> 04:23:17.808]  Big fan of his that are coming up tonight.
[04:23:17.808 --> 04:23:21.269]  But my final question for you is this.
[04:23:21.269 --> 04:23:24.649]  Did you, I should have asked this before the interview, but I didn't have a chance.
[04:23:24.649 --> 04:23:28.150]  Did you see Cy Hirst before that big media conference three weeks ago?
[04:23:28.150 --> 04:23:30.830]  And then the New Yorker reported on it, but didn't give the details.
[04:23:30.830 --> 04:23:32.911]  But his wide-out sources, we know how credible he is.
[04:23:33.531 --> 04:23:48.337]  I said to Dick Cheney a few months before, right after they tried to stage that event in the Strait of Hormuz between Iran and Iraq with a fake radio chatter, tried to paint up, wanted to paint up U.S.
[04:23:48.337 --> 04:23:55.760]  boats like Iranian blue patrol boats and have Navy SEALs, quote, have a shootout between larger U.S.
[04:23:55.760 --> 04:23:58.001]  naval vessels as a false flag event.
[04:23:58.001 --> 04:23:58.962]  A, did you hear of that?
[04:23:58.962 --> 04:24:00.062]  And B, what is your take on it?
[04:24:00.876 --> 04:24:08.619]  I think that Dick Cheney is a multiple warhead, criminal recidivist, as Vice President, together with his President George H.W.
[04:24:08.619 --> 04:24:16.161]  Bush, who violated our Constitution, our federal statutes, and international treaties that we solemnly belong to, like the Geneva Convention.
[04:24:16.161 --> 04:24:29.186]  Second, I wouldn't put it past him, Alex, that he wants to create something worse than the Tompkins-Gault facade, that he would really want to create some kind of warlike
[04:24:29.739 --> 04:24:39.343]  A move against Iran in order to heighten the bubble and shut down dissent and win the election for the Republican Party.
[04:24:39.343 --> 04:24:40.703]  So you think that's a real danger?
[04:24:40.703 --> 04:24:42.424]  I think it's very much a real danger.
[04:24:42.424 --> 04:24:58.210]  Should there be a congressional investigation immediately started or do you have any other ideas of ways to draw attention to the fact that Cy Hirst, the most respected investigative journalist living right now, except maybe yourself, you've worn so many hats, would come out and say this and only Keith Olbermann covered it?
[04:24:59.389 --> 04:25:06.891]  The people in the Pentagon, Alex, are worried about Dick Cheney and the neoconservatives, and the drumbeat against Iran.
[04:25:06.891 --> 04:25:15.373]  And the drumbeat against Iran could get this country in a huge amount of trouble, because it's bigger than Iraq.
[04:25:15.373 --> 04:25:18.374]  The Straits of Hormuz could be blocked, because that could do it.
[04:25:18.374 --> 04:25:19.134]  Oil prices.
[04:25:19.134 --> 04:25:21.335]  Oil, and the prices.
[04:25:21.335 --> 04:25:22.355]  Gasolines.
[04:25:22.355 --> 04:25:24.456]  Eating oil on the economies of the world.
[04:25:24.456 --> 04:25:27.997]  So, I think the Democrats should make a declaration and say,
[04:25:28.695 --> 04:25:42.800]  If Bush J makes a military move, make a military move against Iran, without consulting and being cleared with Congress, under constitutional provision, they will move immediately to impeach him in the House, both of them in the House, and convict him in the Senate.
[04:25:42.800 --> 04:25:43.881]  And you would do that as President?
[04:25:44.662 --> 04:25:45.822]  Absolutely.
[04:25:45.822 --> 04:25:55.446]  In fact, the criminal laws apply to presidents and vice presidents when they leave office, just as they applied to Nixon on Watergate before Ford pardoned him.
[04:25:55.446 --> 04:25:58.207]  And so... Bush has declared these new powers that never existed.
[04:25:58.207 --> 04:26:02.129]  In closing, tell us about the campaign websites and the big rally that's coming up tonight, sir.
[04:26:02.129 --> 04:26:04.530]  Get on our email list, whether you vote for us or not.
[04:26:04.530 --> 04:26:07.631]  Nader Gonzales, the website is VoteNader.org.
[04:26:07.631 --> 04:26:09.572]  That's VoteNader.org.
[04:26:09.572 --> 04:26:14.294]  The super rally is at the University of Denver, the Magnus Auditorium.
[04:26:14.958 --> 04:26:18.060]  It's a very good place, and we want more of you to show up.
[04:26:18.060 --> 04:26:28.648]  It starts at 6.30, and I'll tell you, you'll never forget it after you go through that kind of robust rally where people do not have marbles in their mouth.
[04:26:28.648 --> 04:26:33.792]  Folks, you can buy tickets at Denver Nader HQ, 1155 Sherman Street.
[04:26:33.792 --> 04:26:34.372]  The number is 303.
[04:26:34.372 --> 04:26:37.274]  This is for listeners to listen to us on 1360, The Lion.
[04:26:39.275 --> 04:26:45.856]  You can go to 1155 Sherman Street, 303-832-2509.
[04:26:45.856 --> 04:26:50.497]  And again, that is in Denver, Colorado, coming up this evening.
[04:26:50.497 --> 04:26:52.438]  It's going to be an amazing event, and they've invited me.
[04:26:52.438 --> 04:26:53.398]  I'm very honored.
[04:26:53.398 --> 04:26:55.758]  And I'll be there covering the live event as well.
[04:26:55.758 --> 04:26:57.979]  Mr. Nader, as always, thanks for spending time with us.
[04:26:57.979 --> 04:26:59.059]  Thank you, Alex Jones.
[04:26:59.059 --> 04:27:00.659]  And for working so hard for the cause of liberty.
[04:27:00.659 --> 04:27:01.259]  Thank you.
[04:27:01.259 --> 04:27:02.840]  All right, folks, that's the end of the live feed.
[04:27:02.840 --> 04:27:03.420]  Thanks for watching.
[04:27:04.042 --> 04:27:05.563]  Thank you, Alex Jones.
[04:27:05.563 --> 04:27:10.264]  You know, you are kicking some major NWO ass.
[04:27:10.264 --> 04:27:21.689]  And like I said, folks, if you missed any of it, I mean, we just had Nader on Live in Overdrive, but if you missed any of it, it replays in about 30 seconds over at InfoWars.com.
[04:27:21.689 --> 04:27:28.871]  I want to let you know the Paul Craig Roberts interview I conducted today is a can-not-miss interview.
[04:27:28.871 --> 04:27:29.932]  I still have chills.
[04:27:30.768 --> 04:27:35.895]  So on behalf of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv, this is Jason Burmess signing off.
[04:27:35.895 --> 04:27:36.716]  I'll see you all tomorrow.
