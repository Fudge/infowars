[00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:02.690]  Because we're in a no-holds-barred information war.
[00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.830]  Truth is our weapon.
[00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:14.352]  All right, folks, we are locked and loaded live for the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show with Alex Jones, right now recording live from the DMC.
[00:00:14.412 --> 00:00:18.333]  And you cut off with talking about that live feed from Inside Edition.
[00:00:18.373 --> 00:00:20.114]  Now, we were not able to play that.
[00:00:20.174 --> 00:00:23.995]  I've been refreshing my Justin.tv, but I'm getting blurbs here and there.
[00:00:24.015 --> 00:00:25.235]  Why don't you describe it for us, Alex?
[00:00:26.595 --> 00:00:29.116]  Well, we get this call from Inside Edition.
[00:00:30.274 --> 00:00:34.575]  This morning, and they said, we want to come over to your condo, the condo we rented for the week, right now.
[00:00:35.395 --> 00:00:45.778]  And so we queue up the tapes, we queue up them pushing us first, we queue up Malcolm's people, we queue up Malcolm's people posing with us, and then screaming, kill Michelle Malcolm.
[00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:52.360]  We show them separate media YouTube clips, we're trying, we got it all queued up for them, and they basically didn't want it.
[00:00:53.248 --> 00:00:54.429]  They just didn't want it.
[00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.009]  They wanted me screaming at Michelle Malkin.
[00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.971]  And then they said, why did you pick on a little sweet lady, basically?
[00:00:59.491 --> 00:01:07.475]  And then they had a live feed back to their satellite truck downstairs, beaming it to New York, where they're going to edit it for the piece that's going to air on the East Coast.
[00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:10.837]  In fact, it's starting to air right now.
[00:01:11.197 --> 00:01:12.538]  People did tape Inside Edition.
[00:01:13.038 --> 00:01:17.800]  And I noticed that in the message boards, our listeners have already found the Inside Edition phone number and have been calling them.
[00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.641]  And they're saying, oh, we're trying to interview Michelle Malkin.
[00:01:19.661 --> 00:01:21.122]  That was, you know, an hour ago.
[00:01:22.433 --> 00:01:23.735]  But it's just amazing.
[00:01:24.155 --> 00:01:29.059]  Here's this woman calling for concentration camps for American political dissidents, Arabs, Muslims.
[00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:29.980]  Torture's good.
[00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.861]  Secret arrest is good.
[00:01:31.041 --> 00:01:35.285]  She said, I'm a liar about the Marines killing a puppy when it's even admitted that they did kill the puppy.
[00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:36.546]  I mean, it's just that there's no end to her.
[00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:37.347]  It's on video.
[00:01:37.387 --> 00:01:37.907]  Come on.
[00:01:38.228 --> 00:01:39.669]  Well, I mean, and we have the whole video.
[00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:40.910]  I came up with nice at first.
[00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.632]  People got in my face, and I pushed them back.
[00:01:43.132 --> 00:01:45.815]  They were bumping into me, and they grabbed our camera and assaulted Rob.
[00:01:46.475 --> 00:01:59.482]  And so all of this happened, and it just shows how sick and mentally ill our society is, and even mainline, you know, inside edition, Alex Jones, the big bully, is mean to the little sweetie pie, you know, the O'Reilly co-host of the past, Michelle Malkin.
[00:01:59.942 --> 00:02:05.085]  But the good news is, they're still operating in an old paradigm where they can lie, distort, manipulate, and we'll see what happens.
[00:02:05.105 --> 00:02:06.285]  It might be fair, but I don't think so.
[00:02:08.686 --> 00:02:09.166]  It didn't matter.
[00:02:09.186 --> 00:02:10.467]  We were streaming live on the web.
[00:02:10.868 --> 00:02:11.608]  And we even told them that.
[00:02:11.628 --> 00:02:13.970]  It's like they didn't even connect or notice when I walk in the door.
[00:02:15.191 --> 00:02:17.032]  So, that went out there.
[00:02:17.052 --> 00:02:20.754]  In fact, that will post to archives on Justin.TV.
[00:02:20.774 --> 00:02:24.917]  You click archives and you can watch it right there in the archives.
[00:02:24.957 --> 00:02:32.002]  Maybe after Overdrive, maybe at 3.30 after the Nader interview, if you just want to play that out for the listeners, or people can go there and watch it for themselves.
[00:02:32.022 --> 00:02:33.383]  But I'm going to let you get back to work.
[00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:34.324]  We're going to dial in.
[00:02:35.377 --> 00:02:44.682]  uh... to the system phone network in about fifteen minutes of cell phones we at least have that for the Nader interview and uh... also the Justin TV is going to go live about ten minutes before we get with Nader.
[00:02:44.882 --> 00:02:51.326]  Before we go Alex, I want to get your comments on uh... like MashableGood.com who's saying that you're the one that called for her death.
[00:02:51.346 --> 00:03:00.791]  They're also calling you this ultra leftist and there's this uh... Australian newspaper here, the Donkey Bray, that's also saying you're an ultra leftist and you called for her death.
[00:03:01.051 --> 00:03:02.652]  Isn't it convenient how
[00:03:03.172 --> 00:03:08.239]  You know, you go from ultra-right wing to ultra-left wing all the time when you're not right or left?
[00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:15.971]  Well, we've also found out that these same people were with her the day before the protest, the one that Fox News captured people flipping along.
[00:03:16.833 --> 00:03:20.294]  And that they screamed again, kill Michelle Malkin, kill Michelle Malkin.
[00:03:20.974 --> 00:03:25.935]  I mean, these guys, and then when leftists would surround us, they would say, it's Alex Jones, he's a capitalist pig, he's a stooge.
[00:03:26.356 --> 00:03:28.456]  So they were totally manipulating the crowd.
[00:03:29.076 --> 00:03:32.477]  And they would stand behind me screaming Michelle Malkin, Michelle Malkin, while I was talking.
[00:03:32.717 --> 00:03:33.618]  We'll kill Michelle Malkin.
[00:03:33.658 --> 00:03:34.378]  It's all on video.
[00:03:34.398 --> 00:03:35.198]  It's all on YouTube.
[00:03:36.034 --> 00:03:38.895]  And, uh, it's just, it's just absolutely amazing.
[00:03:39.415 --> 00:03:43.936]  But Michelle Malkin did say on Fox Radio yesterday that I did not say, kill Michelle Malkin.
[00:03:44.437 --> 00:03:48.258]  Uh, so, you know, you know, that doesn't seem to matter to Inside Edition or anybody else.
[00:03:48.578 --> 00:03:55.780]  But she also tried to equate you with those people that were trying to lift the mint, too, like you were somehow at that thing trying to lift the mint on the little television show.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.240]  We're not that idiot.
[00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.461]  No, I was there, yeah, I was there documenting how Recreate 68 does everything to make themselves look like clowns.
[00:04:01.501 --> 00:04:03.202]  We're on record saying that.
[00:04:03.996 --> 00:04:08.360]  And we've got them, you know, the anarchists bumping into us and popping us and doing the rest of it.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.501]  Yeah, we're doing it right back to them.
[00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:10.702]  I'm not putting up with crap anymore.
[00:04:11.282 --> 00:04:12.503]  And yeah, look, we're under attack.
[00:04:12.523 --> 00:04:13.284]  We're on the front lines.
[00:04:13.324 --> 00:04:13.684]  We're here.
[00:04:13.704 --> 00:04:15.086]  I'm going to throw it back to you.
[00:04:15.106 --> 00:04:16.687]  You might play some of those audio clips again.
[00:04:17.167 --> 00:04:18.829]  But this is a media war, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:25.575]  You know, the true media, the true alternative media against the establishment and their little doppelganger.
[00:04:26.935 --> 00:04:29.056]  Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?
[00:04:29.076 --> 00:04:29.836]  I can't find my wallet!
[00:04:52.543 --> 00:04:53.244]  Sound familiar?
[00:04:53.384 --> 00:04:56.706]  Why not save time looking for lost things and lose the stress instead?

[00:05:24.583 --> 00:05:25.604]  Oh, my keys!

[00:05:46.708 --> 00:05:53.133]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:05:53.473 --> 00:05:55.435]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:05:56.115 --> 00:05:57.136]  But who is the enemy?
[00:05:57.657 --> 00:05:58.157]  Bin Laden.
[00:05:58.457 --> 00:05:59.398]  This is his M.O.
[00:05:59.418 --> 00:06:00.799]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:02.480]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:06:02.801 --> 00:06:09.566]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:06:09.966 --> 00:06:10.406]  Some U.S.
[00:06:10.446 --> 00:06:16.111]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:20.252]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:06:20.272 --> 00:06:22.273]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:06:46.508 --> 00:06:48.831]  Collectors, outdoor enthusiasts, survivalists.
[00:06:49.031 --> 00:06:52.675]  The Army Navy store from your memory as a child is just that, a memory.
[00:06:52.775 --> 00:06:57.160]  But there is still one place to find everything from gas masks to ammo cans and find it cheap.
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.842]  MainMilitary.com.
[00:06:58.942 --> 00:07:01.945]  Get hard to find objects like real wool blankets for under 20 bucks.
[00:07:02.205 --> 00:07:02.966]  We're good to go.
[00:07:27.621 --> 00:07:28.462]  Thanks for watching!
[00:07:51.258 --> 00:07:55.439]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:07:56.079 --> 00:07:56.900]  You want answers?
[00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:58.520]  Well, so does he.
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.841]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:03.421 --> 00:08:07.522]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:07.762 --> 00:08:09.903]  Alright, folks, we're back at the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:11.063 --> 00:08:12.084]  Alex just left us.
[00:08:12.144 --> 00:08:16.865]  Remember, we're going to have overdrive, so you can only get that over at InfoWars.com.
[00:08:17.225 --> 00:08:19.426]  We're going to have a live interview with Ralph Nader.
[00:08:19.466 --> 00:08:20.886]  I'm pretty excited about that.
[00:08:20.906 --> 00:08:27.588]  The repeat at InfoWars.com should also be very interesting, after what Paul Craig Roberts had to say today.
[00:08:27.648 --> 00:08:28.788]  Just shocking stuff.
[00:08:28.808 --> 00:08:35.090]  Now we're going to go back to Mark in Oregon, who was saying that he feels that the Bush administration's plans have gone flawlessly.
[00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:36.711]  I'm sorry I had to cut you off there before.
[00:08:36.731 --> 00:08:37.431]  Go ahead, Mark.
[00:08:37.811 --> 00:08:39.053]  That's no problem, Jason.
[00:08:39.073 --> 00:08:44.279]  Hello again, and by the way, you know, thanks for the great energy that you bring to this show, and Alex is dead.
[00:08:44.299 --> 00:08:47.602]  I mean, we don't miss anything, and that's saying a lot when Alex is not there.
[00:08:47.783 --> 00:08:48.323]  Well, thanks, man.
[00:08:48.343 --> 00:08:48.904]  I appreciate that.
[00:08:49.144 --> 00:08:49.525]  Yes, sir.
[00:08:50.185 --> 00:08:56.893]  Jason, as I was saying, you know, I've been watching this administration for seven-plus years, and very closely.
[00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:03.777]  I have not seen them fail on one point of their agenda either domestically or internationally.
[00:09:04.378 --> 00:09:13.611]  And I believe that their agenda has predominantly been to affect this country, to make this country and everything that they've done to make this country look
[00:09:14.873 --> 00:09:21.378]  I've always felt that way too, and I'm going to let you continue, but that's why today's conversation with Paul Craig Roberts was so shocking to me.
[00:09:21.418 --> 00:09:23.840]  I've always felt like they want to make us into the new Nazi Germany.
[00:09:33.227 --> 00:09:48.502]  And, you know, eventually all this stuff will come out, 9-11, Iraq, Iran, and they will call for a new international tribunal that needs to head these things up and take over, and we'll lose all of our military power, all of our sovereignty, our Constitution, our Bill of Rights.
[00:09:49.283 --> 00:09:50.964]  I mean, that's how I've seen it going.
[00:09:51.845 --> 00:09:53.266]  Paul Craig Roberts seems to disagree.
[00:09:53.306 --> 00:09:54.948]  Things were on the verge of nuclear warfare.
[00:09:54.988 --> 00:09:55.308]  Who knows?
[00:09:55.348 --> 00:09:55.709]  Continue.
[00:09:56.175 --> 00:10:13.784]  Yes, and what you have here is a premise that they have laid out for themselves, I think, from ancient times, essentially, and that has to do with the Phoenician myth about the phoenix who is reborn from the flames of its demise and crash into the earth.
[00:10:14.884 --> 00:10:19.887]  And out of this country's destruction will be born the true phoenix, which is the New World Order.
[00:10:21.085 --> 00:10:26.408]  And it can only be done by the way that they've set their agenda up, by destroying America.
[00:10:26.508 --> 00:10:49.841]  America is fitted into the whole agenda as it stands at this current time, and as it's been laid out over the last century or so in detail, ever since Albert Pike said that there would be three world wars, and that the last war would be between the Muslim religion and the Christian religion, basically, I think, or the Muslim and the Jewish religion.
[00:10:50.982 --> 00:11:10.884]  Uh, so that you actually have things being laid out so far ahead of time, and that the United States plays such a pivotal role to its own great loss, to its own destruction, and that everything that's being done in Russia now that you're concerned about, uh, people name this every day as being in the Bible, in the Old and the New Testament.
[00:11:11.685 --> 00:11:11.865]  Yes, sir.
[00:11:23.248 --> 00:11:26.451]  Who deceive the nations that's mentioned in revelations.
[00:11:26.571 --> 00:11:28.032]  It sure seems that way, doesn't it?
[00:11:28.112 --> 00:11:31.314]  It seems like we are at the top of the pyramid, the top of the food chain.
[00:11:31.334 --> 00:11:38.460]  We are more decadent than ever in this country with things like the iPhone, Britney Spears, MTV 1 through 46.
[00:11:39.441 --> 00:11:41.582]  I mean, how many networks does MTV really need, folks?
[00:11:41.823 --> 00:11:42.903]  I thank you for the call, Mark.
[00:11:43.864 --> 00:11:48.308]  You know, I think we've fallen greatly in this country from not only our morality,
[00:11:49.028 --> 00:11:54.751]  But our general humanity, our love for our fellow man, our caring for our neighbor, it's gone.
[00:11:54.831 --> 00:12:06.216]  Most people are in this, go get them attitude, I'm out for me, I'm more concerned about my job, my car, how cool I look, am I fashionable, can I afford this thing?
[00:12:06.256 --> 00:12:13.859]  Meanwhile, banks are failing, houses are being taken, our dollars being devalued on a whole separate level.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.502]  You know, I'm not one of these prophecy guys.
[00:12:17.522 --> 00:12:19.563]  I don't talk about the Bible prophecies.
[00:12:19.623 --> 00:12:21.125]  I don't talk about Nostradamus.
[00:12:21.185 --> 00:12:29.692]  I don't even talk about, you know, I talk about people within the last hundred, maybe even two hundred years that have put it down on paper as a social prediction, you know, through engineering.
[00:12:29.752 --> 00:12:34.416]  But as far as biblical prophecy, I tend to stay away from that stuff, although it is very, very interesting.
[00:12:34.436 --> 00:12:39.380]  And, you know, not only Bible prophecy have I watched, but, you know, Jordan Maxwell's material is great.
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.662]  I'm a big fan of Anthony J. Hilder.
[00:12:42.302 --> 00:12:46.925]  All these great granddaddies of the new world order, or anti-new world order movement, I should say.
[00:12:46.945 --> 00:12:49.526]  I have some great, great info.
[00:12:50.267 --> 00:12:55.630]  Before we jump to Rick in Texas, I want to play my second trailer for Fabled Enemies.
[00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:59.492]  It drops August 31st and it will be available on DVD September 1st.
[00:12:59.512 --> 00:13:02.174]  That's when we're shipping them out, so order them now so we can get them out the door.
[00:13:02.714 --> 00:13:04.235]  And I'm stoked about this film.
[00:13:04.835 --> 00:13:15.221]  It goes over the intelligence ties of the hijackers of Bin Laden, the continuity of government program, the Israeli operatives that were detained that day, and much, much more, including the anthrax attacks.
[00:13:15.241 --> 00:13:15.781]  So take it away.
[00:13:16.602 --> 00:13:25.007]  Fox News has learned that some American terrorism investigators fear certain suspects in the September 11th attacks may have managed to stay ahead of them.
[00:13:26.082 --> 00:13:26.523]  Some U.S.
[00:13:26.563 --> 00:13:32.328]  investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:39.796]  Whether it's because they're in intelligence services or what they were doing, I will defer to the Department of Justice and the FBI.
[00:13:39.816 --> 00:13:46.042]  There was a report on the George Washington Bridge that there had been a van stopped there that had explosives.
[00:13:46.062 --> 00:13:48.664]  We have the suspect to address.
[00:13:48.684 --> 00:13:49.865]  A broken van that had explosives.
[00:13:52.214 --> 00:13:56.155]  Amdocs Limited, an Israeli-based private telecommunications company.
[00:13:57.235 --> 00:14:02.876]  It is virtually impossible to make a call on normal phones without generating an Amdocs record of it.
[00:14:03.536 --> 00:14:08.937]  It quickly unraveled to be the largest foreign spy ring ever uncovered inside the United States.
[00:14:08.997 --> 00:14:09.697]  The largest.
[00:14:10.117 --> 00:14:17.698]  Documents say they, quote, targeted and penetrated military bases, the DEA, FBI, and dozens of other government facilities.
[00:14:18.419 --> 00:14:20.579]  There's one big elephant in the living room.
[00:14:21.894 --> 00:14:26.199]  It is the relationship between the United States of America and the State of Israel.
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:30.924]  What about this question of advanced knowledge of what was going to happen on 9-11?
[00:14:30.944 --> 00:14:33.407]  Well, it's very explosive information, obviously.
[00:14:33.507 --> 00:14:36.290]  A bigger question, they say, is how could they not have known?
[00:14:38.246 --> 00:14:43.229]  Fabled Enemies, August 31st on PrisonPlanet.tv, shipping the DVDs September 1st.
[00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:46.411]  Very, very excited about that release.
[00:14:46.431 --> 00:14:50.574]  Remember, if you want to see it on the big screen, come down to New York City, meet myself, meet Alex Jones.
[00:14:50.794 --> 00:14:57.158]  We're going to be playing that and 9-11 Chronicles, Truth Rising, another great DVD that's available at the InfoWars.com shop.
[00:14:57.378 --> 00:14:58.079]  Just a ton of stuff.
[00:14:58.099 --> 00:15:02.461]  American Drug War, we touched on, you know, how we've run drugs in this country.
[00:15:02.762 --> 00:15:06.264]  I mean, there's just so much information that you can get
[00:15:06.824 --> 00:15:35.585]  uh... by becoming a prison planet dot tv subscriber or ordering these dvds from alex jones himself at the info wars shop all right let's take a few more callers let's go to rick in texas rick what's on your mind hi jason uh... i first i want to say thank you uh... because uh... you're uh... well when you participate in the loose change the second edition that's what woke me up a couple years ago and uh... i was uh... i want to call in because uh... bob chapman made a very important
[00:15:36.679 --> 00:15:44.162]  Um, saying when he, statement when he said that one of the most, the biggest things we could do would be the fire all of Congress.
[00:15:44.902 --> 00:15:51.825]  Uh, I am the, uh, one of the national organizers and the founders of, uh, firecongress.meetup.com.
[00:15:52.585 --> 00:15:58.487]  And, uh, we're not making any money on this, but we want to kick every one of the incumbents out as, as many as possible.
[00:15:58.828 --> 00:16:02.169]  Our goal is to kick them all out except for Ron Paul and Dennis Kucinich.
[00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:05.012]  And I would encourage everybody to check it out.
[00:16:12.146 --> 00:16:19.671]  FireCongress.meetup.com and also you can read about our plan at FireCongress.org.
[00:16:20.272 --> 00:16:20.792]  All right, man.
[00:16:20.832 --> 00:16:21.953]  Thank you so much for the call.
[00:16:21.993 --> 00:16:23.434]  I believe that as well.
[00:16:23.454 --> 00:16:24.554]  We need to get rid of Congress.
[00:16:25.175 --> 00:16:32.080]  You know, Kucinich and Ron Paul seem to be like the only two guys that are standing up for the Constitution, the Bill of Rights.
[00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:33.520]  So I'm with you there, my friend.
[00:16:34.101 --> 00:16:36.322]  All right, let's jump to Steve in Canada.
[00:16:36.342 --> 00:16:37.083]  Steve, what's on your mind?
[00:16:39.124 --> 00:16:39.665]  You there, Steve?
[00:16:39.985 --> 00:16:40.485]  Yes, I am.
[00:16:40.725 --> 00:16:41.286]  Sorry about that.
[00:16:43.258 --> 00:16:50.602]  The reason I'm calling is that I was escaping reality for a little bit about 10 days ago watching a football game.
[00:16:50.642 --> 00:16:53.724]  We have a professional football league up here in Canada.
[00:16:53.744 --> 00:16:56.445]  It's the CFL.
[00:16:56.785 --> 00:17:01.668]  Watching the Toronto Argonauts and one of their offensive linemen, Ross Weaver,
[00:17:02.501 --> 00:17:09.752]  All of a sudden he's being recalled by the Air Force.
[00:17:09.772 --> 00:17:12.355]  So they had to let him out of his contract.
[00:17:12.636 --> 00:17:14.999]  He's a missile combat crew commander.
[00:17:15.019 --> 00:17:18.624]  I forget which state he's out of.
[00:17:19.845 --> 00:17:31.529]  Yeah, he handles security for the nuclear missile base in the state that he was in, and they did an emergency recall on him on August the 12th.
[00:17:31.989 --> 00:17:37.291]  And just so people know, most of the professional Canadian football players are cropped out of the United States.
[00:17:37.611 --> 00:17:41.012]  You know, people that were drafted third round didn't end up making the cut.
[00:17:41.432 --> 00:17:45.054]  And, I mean, I remember when Doug Flutie went over, I think it was, to the Toronto Argonauts.
[00:17:45.074 --> 00:17:45.474]  That's right.
[00:17:45.494 --> 00:17:46.094]  Back in the day.
[00:17:46.594 --> 00:17:48.655]  And that's what kind of launched the CFL.
[00:17:48.675 --> 00:17:52.577]  And there was another big running back that never really amounted to anything that went there, too.
[00:17:52.637 --> 00:17:54.738]  Ricky Williams went there a couple years ago.
[00:17:54.818 --> 00:17:55.198]  That's right.
[00:17:55.438 --> 00:17:57.819]  I'm talking like 15 years ago when it was first introduced.
[00:17:57.879 --> 00:18:02.021]  We've had a number of amazing players that actually started.
[00:18:02.141 --> 00:18:07.844]  I mean, Jeff Garcia won the CFL Championship twice in Calgary before going to the NFL.
[00:18:08.524 --> 00:18:12.165]  So for them to pull these guys, I mean, they're making some decent scratch.
[00:18:12.205 --> 00:18:19.727]  I mean, they're not lavished quite as much as an NFL player, but for him to be pulled to go do military service means that something could be up.
[00:18:19.747 --> 00:18:20.967]  I thank you for the call, Steve.
[00:18:20.987 --> 00:18:21.727]  That is interesting.
[00:18:22.028 --> 00:18:25.629]  And let us talk about football for two minutes on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:18:26.049 --> 00:18:27.089]  Almost unheard of.
[00:18:28.729 --> 00:18:31.990]  Alright, let us jump to, I think it's Bruce in Connecticut.
[00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:32.870]  What's on your mind, Bruce?
[00:18:33.411 --> 00:18:34.351]  Hey, how's it going?
[00:18:34.491 --> 00:18:34.791]  Good, man.
[00:18:35.701 --> 00:18:37.822]  Thanks to all you guys for putting out the word.
[00:18:38.123 --> 00:18:39.043]  A few things.
[00:18:39.924 --> 00:18:40.544]  I'm 48.
[00:18:40.604 --> 00:18:44.526]  I remember back in the Kent days and they had all that shit going on.
[00:18:44.586 --> 00:18:45.827]  I gotta drop you, dude.
[00:18:45.847 --> 00:18:47.948]  You gotta watch your language when you're on the show, man.
[00:18:47.988 --> 00:18:48.509]  I'm sorry.
[00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:54.932]  Maybe he was talking about Kent State and the students that were shot there.
[00:18:56.013 --> 00:18:57.173]  No excuses really there.
[00:18:58.473 --> 00:19:01.935]  The military began firing on students when they were peacefully protesting.
[00:19:02.916 --> 00:19:19.065]  An interesting point that I did want to make was that Michael Rivera was pretty spot on in yesterday's broadcast when he talked about Recreate 68 and the original 68 actually being funded and provocateured by agencies within the United States.
[00:19:19.366 --> 00:19:21.347]  The FBI and CIA, big shocker there.
[00:19:21.527 --> 00:19:22.688]  They incited the riots.
[00:19:23.632 --> 00:19:24.012]  All right?
[00:19:24.393 --> 00:19:26.835]  They would have loved to incite riots this time, but we exposed them.
[00:19:26.895 --> 00:19:27.416]  So what do they do?
[00:19:27.436 --> 00:19:28.416]  They do the next best thing.
[00:19:29.077 --> 00:19:31.820]  They dress everybody up in a goofy magician's outfit.
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:35.983]  Mickey Mouse and Fantasia, of course, and say they're going to levitate the mint.
[00:19:36.624 --> 00:19:38.946]  I don't want to be associated with those people, and I know you don't either.
[00:19:39.186 --> 00:19:40.728]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:19:47.791 --> 00:19:49.333]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:19:49.494 --> 00:19:49.734]  August 27, 2008.
[00:19:49.794 --> 00:19:50.555]  Gold opened at $828.50.
[00:19:50.715 --> 00:19:54.080]  One ounce gold coins can be purchased for $853.36, $420.58 for half ounce, and $210.29 for quarter ounce.
[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:54.421]  That's $853.36, $420.58, and $210.29.
[00:20:04.395 --> 00:20:09.978]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[00:20:10.018 --> 00:20:14.061]  treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing the Yan revolution.
[00:20:14.361 --> 00:20:22.246]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[00:20:22.286 --> 00:20:24.687]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[00:20:24.947 --> 00:20:28.570]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:34.735]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.
[00:20:35.055 --> 00:20:38.358]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[00:20:38.378 --> 00:20:41.340]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:41.680]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:42.020]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.261]  May I have everybody's attention please?
[00:20:53.119 --> 00:20:55.140]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.781]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:20:56.861 --> 00:20:59.682]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:20:59.742 --> 00:21:04.725]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:21:04.785 --> 00:21:12.748]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[00:21:13.049 --> 00:21:17.911]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:21:25.772 --> 00:21:29.213]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:21:29.233 --> 00:21:31.634]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:21:31.674 --> 00:21:38.517]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[00:21:50.338 --> 00:21:59.981]  Did you know that modern technology has devised a barcode that fits inside a tiny microchip that can be placed under the skin of dogs and children to track them everywhere they go?
[00:22:00.982 --> 00:22:10.485]  Did you know they're now working on a chip to place under the skin of human beings that'll let you buy and sell in a global economy without cash, coins, and checks?
[00:22:11.531 --> 00:22:17.033]  It's the coming 666 system called the Mark of the Beast in Revelation chapter 13.

[00:23:26.834 --> 00:23:27.034]  I think.
[00:24:03.833 --> 00:24:07.516]  Oh, the vampire!
[00:24:09.097 --> 00:24:09.477]  We're back.
[00:24:09.517 --> 00:24:10.858]  It's the Alex Jones Show Live.
[00:24:10.958 --> 00:24:13.280]  I am Jason Burmas, sitting in for Alex all week.
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:19.024]  Remember, you can see live video feeds from the DNC right now at InfoWars.com.
[00:24:19.084 --> 00:24:20.525]  It should be very, very lively.
[00:24:22.086 --> 00:24:27.129]  Ralph Nader will be joining us via Justin.tv at InfoWars.com.
[00:24:28.186 --> 00:24:30.969]  or over the cell line with Alex Jones.
[00:24:31.029 --> 00:24:32.089]  It should be very interesting.
[00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:44.000]  We've shown the clip of Malkin trying to associate Jones with these idiot left-wingers who think that they're going to magically raise the mint and they're gonna dress in capes and little hats and have magic wands.
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:44.981]  Excellent!
[00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:47.412]  Well, not really, actually.
[00:24:47.432 --> 00:24:58.683]  If you're trying to influence people or show that you have some kind of credibility or you have some kind of a plan or a reason for being there, no, you're just going to get in a robe and act like an idiot.
[00:24:59.424 --> 00:25:02.287]  Alright, we're going to continue to take your calls in this hour.
[00:25:02.427 --> 00:25:04.269]  Let's go to Mary in Florida.
[00:25:04.409 --> 00:25:05.170]  Mary, what's on your mind?
[00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:07.960]  Thank you so much.
[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:11.661]  Thank you for bringing up that topic, too, because that's exactly what I wanted to talk about.
[00:25:12.821 --> 00:25:23.644]  I think everybody should call Inside Edition, and it's the numbers 212-817-5555, and tell them that they should not spin the story about what happened with Malcolm.
[00:25:24.244 --> 00:25:28.765]  They should tell the truth, that Jones did not, say, kill Malcolm.
[00:25:29.245 --> 00:25:31.666]  That there's video evidence that
[00:25:32.173 --> 00:25:37.225]  Those were provocateurs doing that, because there is evidence that he did not say that.
[00:25:38.368 --> 00:25:41.735]  And they're not going to get away with spreading a story, and I think we should tell them that.
[00:25:42.466 --> 00:25:42.846]  Excellent.
[00:25:42.866 --> 00:25:47.308]  I mean, I think that we not only need to do that, but we need to bombard Fox Radio.
[00:25:47.568 --> 00:25:54.470]  A lot of people don't know, but Hannity's got his own show, O'Reilly's got his own show, Gibson's got his own show, and you've got to get past the screeners.
[00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:59.452]  We don't screen calls on this show, but they often screen calls on that show.
[00:25:59.492 --> 00:26:07.835]  So, act like you're sympathetic towards John McCain or their position until you get on the air, and then you tell the truth until they catch you off guard.
[00:26:10.276 --> 00:26:10.696]  Obviously.
[00:26:10.716 --> 00:26:15.419]  I feel like you're a UConn Nazi, and then go all InfoWars on them.
[00:26:15.659 --> 00:26:16.179]  Exactly.
[00:26:16.339 --> 00:26:23.063]  That's what Alex Jones does, and he did so well at the DNC yesterday in front of MSNBC for 20 minutes.
[00:26:23.083 --> 00:26:26.045]  He took over the show, talked about 9-11 being an inside job.
[00:26:26.085 --> 00:26:31.808]  That message, it's like when your fire alarm goes off, only you can't take out the battery.
[00:26:31.828 --> 00:26:33.529]  You just gotta keep hearing the message.
[00:26:33.549 --> 00:26:34.630]  And he got his website out.
[00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:36.531]  I love Alex Jones' tactics.
[00:26:36.551 --> 00:26:37.492]  Thank you for the call, Mary.
[00:26:38.092 --> 00:26:48.035]  All right, lest we be accused of not taking every call, I have somebody on the line who's calling himself Jim from Planet Zorbia.
[00:26:48.416 --> 00:26:49.256]  Jim, what's on your mind?
[00:26:49.876 --> 00:26:51.577]  Okay, my parents woke me up in 65.
[00:26:51.677 --> 00:26:55.338]  I won't bore you with everything, but I've been watching this ever since.
[00:26:55.758 --> 00:26:57.098]  The New World Order is very old.
[00:26:58.019 --> 00:27:00.520]  They tailor-made their takeovers to every era, country, and economy.
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.421]  And I have proof, and you can verify it.
[00:27:03.541 --> 00:27:04.421]  Our yuppies are next.
[00:27:05.261 --> 00:27:07.342]  Jason, why did Hitler go after the Jews?
[00:27:08.451 --> 00:27:14.455]  I think it was because they were an easy target for the rest of the population to go after, and he was able to take their wealth at the same time.
[00:27:14.875 --> 00:27:15.476]  Yeah, it was the money.
[00:27:15.496 --> 00:27:19.078]  He started by rounding up the fringiest groups, then went on to the jackpot, the Jews and the factory owners.
[00:27:19.678 --> 00:27:24.762]  Two years ago, my property was attacked, and I found, in writing, in plain sight, the American equivalent of Hitler's attack on the Jews.
[00:27:25.262 --> 00:27:26.743]  Are you ready for a four-minute shock treatment?
[00:27:27.464 --> 00:27:27.924]  Let's hear it!
[00:27:28.444 --> 00:27:33.107]  In wealthy economies, the skilled, motivated, innovative middle-class people create the most wealth, elitist steel wealth.
[00:27:33.568 --> 00:27:35.889]  Have you heard of the International Property Maintenance Code?
[00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:37.070]  I have not.
[00:27:37.609 --> 00:27:41.133]  Okay, this will sound unbelievable, but it's true, very intense and very important.
[00:27:41.914 --> 00:27:42.895]  Let me go all the way to the kicker.
[00:27:43.195 --> 00:27:43.455]  Okay.
[00:27:43.836 --> 00:27:48.360]  Any jurisdiction anywhere in the world can adopt this code and enforce it as if it's legitimate.
[00:27:48.721 --> 00:27:51.284]  Some do it with an administrative decree.
[00:27:51.784 --> 00:27:55.988]  Put international property maintenance code in quotes.
[00:27:56.429 --> 00:27:58.391]  Do a search, download the free 2003 version in PDF format.
[00:28:00.513 --> 00:28:02.195]  It is infinitely worse than eminent domain.
[00:28:02.235 --> 00:28:03.936]  It costs money to do the eminent domain trick.
[00:28:04.336 --> 00:28:09.641]  It is extremely lucrative to steal property with the IPMC, and it's happening all over America right now.
[00:28:10.121 --> 00:28:12.984]  I did a program with Gary Brownfield on it one hour, two years ago, okay?
[00:28:13.044 --> 00:28:14.145]  One with Pastor Butch DePaul, too.
[00:28:14.625 --> 00:28:15.066]  Here it is.
[00:28:15.366 --> 00:28:18.168]  The code official is the sole interpreter of the code.
[00:28:18.508 --> 00:28:19.870]  Forget due process, there isn't any.
[00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:24.954]  He is investigator, prosecutor, judge, jury, executioner, the sole interpreter.
[00:28:25.034 --> 00:28:28.578]  All right, so give out this code again, really slow, because you're a fast talker.
[00:28:28.618 --> 00:28:30.760]  I thank you for the information.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:31.401]  That's all right, man.
[00:28:31.441 --> 00:28:34.604]  I just want my listeners to be able to go check out this code themselves.
[00:28:34.644 --> 00:28:36.406]  Just give out the code one more time for us.
[00:28:36.486 --> 00:28:36.846]  Yes.
[00:28:37.427 --> 00:28:38.368]  I'll give you the website later.
[00:28:38.808 --> 00:28:42.232]  The International Property Maintenance Code.
[00:28:42.532 --> 00:28:45.855]  Get the 2003 version of the International Property Maintenance Code.
[00:28:46.656 --> 00:28:47.996]  And I'll give you a little more later.
[00:28:48.356 --> 00:28:49.497]  Okay, now here's a killer.
[00:28:49.897 --> 00:28:52.498]  Every infraction, there's several killers here, let me go to the killer.
[00:28:52.998 --> 00:29:00.820]  Every infraction is a mandatory misdemeanor, usually in terms of hundreds of dollars and or a month in jail per infraction, and every day the infraction occurs as a separate offense.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:09.042]  Anything the code official says is not in good working order, example, sticky window, loose door, torn window screen, dented gutter, anything he says is not in good working order.
[00:29:09.342 --> 00:29:11.582]  Every day it exists, separate mandatory misdemeanor.
[00:29:11.622 --> 00:29:13.023]  Alright, I gotta cut you off there.
[00:29:13.783 --> 00:29:14.764]  I thank you for the call, Jim.
[00:29:14.804 --> 00:29:15.824]  I hope people go check that out.
[00:29:15.844 --> 00:29:18.026]  We're going to be taking your calls in the next half hour.
[00:29:18.286 --> 00:29:23.289]  And then, in overdrive, Ralph Nader, only at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:29:36.869 --> 00:29:39.870]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:43.612]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:46.893 --> 00:29:53.295]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:29:53.655 --> 00:29:55.316]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:29:56.286 --> 00:29:57.307]  But who is the enemy?
[00:29:57.827 --> 00:29:58.348]  Bin Laden.
[00:29:58.628 --> 00:29:59.629]  This is his M.O.
[00:29:59.649 --> 00:30:00.950]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:02.671]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:30:02.991 --> 00:30:09.736]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:30:10.136 --> 00:30:10.597]  Some U.S.
[00:30:10.637 --> 00:30:16.261]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:30:16.981 --> 00:30:20.483]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:30:20.783 --> 00:30:23.524]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:30:46.624 --> 00:30:49.688]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[00:30:50.068 --> 00:30:52.131]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[00:30:52.371 --> 00:30:55.375]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[00:30:55.675 --> 00:31:02.183]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[00:31:02.563 --> 00:31:04.666]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[00:31:05.166 --> 00:31:08.229]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[00:31:08.449 --> 00:31:13.092]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[00:31:13.253 --> 00:31:16.956]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[00:31:17.176 --> 00:31:18.697]  Travel less, meet online.
[00:31:18.817 --> 00:31:21.299]  Go to Webex.com and try Webex free.
[00:31:21.479 --> 00:31:27.084]  Just click the radiographic and enter promo code 500 to get a free trial and a free webcam too.
[00:31:27.404 --> 00:31:28.204]  Remember that code 500.
[00:31:28.865 --> 00:31:30.907]  The pressures of everyday life can deliver a serious blow to your health.
[00:31:30.927 --> 00:31:33.249]  Stress increases blood pressure, potential heart problems, strokes, ulcers,
[00:31:54.206 --> 00:31:54.526]  I'm good.
[00:32:10.874 --> 00:32:11.515]  We're good to go!
[00:32:32.912 --> 00:32:35.393]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:32:35.413 --> 00:32:36.634]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:04.674 --> 00:33:07.796]  All right, a little Barracuda to bring it up.
[00:33:07.816 --> 00:33:08.657]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:08.697 --> 00:33:11.759]  I am Jason Bermas, sitting in for Alex throughout the week.
[00:33:11.779 --> 00:33:13.440]  And remember, Friday we're going to be doing a Best Of.
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:23.588]  And on top of just the Best Of, we're also going to be playing some clips that we didn't play during the week that were streamed live over at InfoWars.com through the great service of Justin.tv.
[00:33:23.628 --> 00:33:24.848]  Thank you for that service, guys.
[00:33:24.888 --> 00:33:26.570]  And we're going to be jumping to Ralph Nader.
[00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:34.776]  In a little bit, in the Overdrive, remember you can only get Overdrive at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:33:34.816 --> 00:33:39.780]  PrisonPlanet.tv allows you to see my pretty little face on the video monitor while I talk to all these people.
[00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:42.502]  And, you know, Alex just keeps on expanding.
[00:33:42.642 --> 00:33:44.503]  You know, he's working on a new television network.
[00:33:44.563 --> 00:33:45.965]  I very much want to be a part of that.
[00:33:46.345 --> 00:33:47.706]  I want to be a part of this Infowar.
[00:33:47.726 --> 00:33:48.647]  I want to do the right thing.
[00:33:48.727 --> 00:33:50.368]  I want to try to help humanity.
[00:33:50.388 --> 00:33:55.192]  I want to try to build this country back up based on its constitutional principles.
[00:33:56.445 --> 00:33:59.987]  Does that make me a far-leftist or a right-wing radical?
[00:34:00.327 --> 00:34:00.568]  No!
[00:34:01.608 --> 00:34:13.736]  It makes me somebody who believes in this country, who believes in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and checks and balances, in a system where one cannot just declare something and put it into law.
[00:34:13.936 --> 00:34:15.777]  One person can't say, I own that.
[00:34:16.677 --> 00:34:17.198]  It's mine.
[00:34:17.958 --> 00:34:18.659]  I'll do what I want.
[00:34:18.719 --> 00:34:21.540]  But really, that's a lot like what we have.
[00:34:21.601 --> 00:34:23.061]  I mean, even people that try to
[00:34:24.494 --> 00:34:31.641]  Fight, if you will, fight the system and say, I'm not going to give up my farm for the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[00:34:31.881 --> 00:34:44.052]  Well, they often lose, and then they're sued for it, and not only do they not take the unfair amount that's offered by the government, usually between, you know, one-third and one-tenth of the actual value is what's offered, and then if you don't take that,
[00:34:45.208 --> 00:34:48.270]  No, we're going to sue you, and we're just going to take it anyway.
[00:34:49.011 --> 00:34:52.013]  That should not be allowed, and that's what we've slipped into in this country.
[00:34:53.074 --> 00:35:07.886]  I don't know much about this code that the last caller was talking about, but if it's what I think it is, it could be something as simple as, all right, you have some lawn furniture that's against code, and every day that you have that out there, it would be a separate fine of about $300, so in a week you could rack up a $2,100 bill.
[00:35:09.907 --> 00:35:15.973]  One of the easiest ways for the elitist to control us is to control our monetary funds.
[00:35:15.993 --> 00:35:21.439]  It basically controls what kind of goods and services we can buy and what our standard of living will be.
[00:35:21.799 --> 00:35:23.661]  Alright, let's continue on with callers.
[00:35:23.681 --> 00:35:24.922]  We're going to shoot through them.
[00:35:24.942 --> 00:35:26.604]  Let's go to Brian in Florida.
[00:35:26.624 --> 00:35:27.445]  Brian, what's on your mind?
[00:35:28.106 --> 00:35:28.707]  Hey, Jason.
[00:35:29.067 --> 00:35:32.190]  First of all, I want to thank you as well for your work with Loose Change.
[00:35:32.211 --> 00:35:34.633]  You were instrumental in opening my eyes to a lot of things.
[00:35:34.713 --> 00:35:35.174]  Well, thank you.
[00:35:35.554 --> 00:35:36.876]  So I thank you very much for that.
[00:35:37.156 --> 00:35:44.344]  Listen, Jason, I'm watching TV right now, and I'm watching The Hunt for Red October, and I noticed it had been on quite a few times recently.
[00:35:45.131 --> 00:35:58.978]  In light of everything that's going on, your conversation with Paul Craig Roberts, I did a little quick search on my digital system and found 74 different entries with programs pertaining to Russia that are on right now, or in the coming days.
[00:35:59.038 --> 00:36:07.401]  Now, some of them are duplicate entries, but I'd be curious to know, viewers... It doesn't seem like it's a coincidence, does it?
[00:36:07.522 --> 00:36:11.643]  And, you know, I've been seeing the red... the Humphrey Red October on things like the History Channel lately.
[00:36:11.683 --> 00:36:12.324]  Is that what it's on?
[00:36:12.984 --> 00:36:28.169]  It's on AMC right now, but I'd be curious who's watching Red Dawn on television these days, or Firefox, or anything else like that, and how many times they're being played, and what kind of programs, specifically about Russia, are being played on local cable stations across the country.
[00:36:28.409 --> 00:36:31.310]  Yeah, I would assume that this is the time to gear it up.
[00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:40.033]  I mean, we know after 9-11, they took some of the most famous songs, including John Lennon's Imagine, off the air, because they didn't want people to think about that.
[00:36:41.883 --> 00:36:44.485]  Believe that they put this kind of propaganda out there.
[00:36:44.585 --> 00:36:47.647]  I'm not sure, but I think Humphrey Red October is a Tom Clancy novel.
[00:36:47.687 --> 00:36:48.408]  No, I'm sure of it.
[00:36:48.688 --> 00:36:49.869]  It is a Tom Clancy novel.
[00:36:50.509 --> 00:36:50.649]  Yes.
[00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:55.613]  Because it involves Jack Ryan before he becomes president in this whole series of novels.
[00:36:56.994 --> 00:37:01.638]  What disturbs me about Clancy is that he does seem to be some sort of a prophet.
[00:37:01.678 --> 00:37:03.799]  Now, do I think that Clancy's in on it?
[00:37:04.079 --> 00:37:04.280]  No.
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:07.262]  I think that Clancy talks to a lot of intelligence officials.
[00:37:07.342 --> 00:37:13.126]  Obviously, he writes these books, so he has a pretty good understanding of the military-industrial complex.
[00:37:13.387 --> 00:37:26.817]  And that's why in 2001, when they put out the original Ghost Recon, they were able to predict that Georgia, South Ossetia, and Russia were going to have a conflict in April of 2008, and it was going to be the complete restructuring
[00:37:27.937 --> 00:37:30.779]  Now, when I got this email, I said, no way.
[00:37:31.299 --> 00:37:37.441]  No way that this game came out seven years ago and that it takes place in 2008 and it mirrors the conflict that's going on.
[00:37:37.702 --> 00:37:41.023]  Also, that conflict was initiated with U.S.
[00:37:41.063 --> 00:37:42.944]  Special Forces going to aid Georgia.
[00:37:43.925 --> 00:37:46.507]  You know, it's just unbelievable, but it happened, you know?
[00:37:46.688 --> 00:37:54.495]  And this is the same guy who, before 9-11, wrote about a commercial airliner hitting the Capitol and decapitating Congress.
[00:37:54.555 --> 00:37:58.418]  And then, literally within the year, we have commercial airliners hitting buildings.
[00:37:58.919 --> 00:38:02.062]  So, you know, Clancy himself is an interesting subject.
[00:38:02.082 --> 00:38:03.343]  I wish we could get him on the show.
[00:38:03.443 --> 00:38:06.386]  I thank you for the call, Brian, and I'm interested also to know
[00:38:06.966 --> 00:38:08.627]  You know, who's putting this programming out there?
[00:38:08.907 --> 00:38:13.248]  And are we putting it out there now to try to demonize Russia yet again?
[00:38:13.448 --> 00:38:15.469]  To make them, you know, the enemy.
[00:38:15.529 --> 00:38:16.769]  The Red Scare is back.
[00:38:17.409 --> 00:38:18.290]  It's very possible.
[00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:27.433]  I think it's going to be tougher to sell that Red Scare, though, seeing as we just had the Olympics in Beijing, China, and we're trying to act like China's a great nation.
[00:38:28.113 --> 00:38:30.994]  That's a pretty hard act to follow.
[00:38:31.414 --> 00:38:33.815]  Peggy in Pennsylvania, what is on your mind, Peggy?
[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:37.081]  I need to say a word in defense of the sheeple.
[00:38:38.161 --> 00:38:54.164]  I'm not trying to insult either you or Alex or anybody on the show, but there have been references to the common people of the U.S., the sheeple, and how they're so stupid and all these things.
[00:38:55.344 --> 00:38:58.745]  What I think Alex may not concentrate on is the fact that
[00:39:00.737 --> 00:39:06.842]  And various writers have commented on this in Anthropology and so on, that there's basically two types of people.
[00:39:07.883 --> 00:39:09.525]  And they fall into general groups.
[00:39:09.545 --> 00:39:15.270]  One is the people that would be the neocons, and their mindset.
[00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:19.974]  Evil or not, they're very aggressive and masculine-centered.
[00:39:20.394 --> 00:39:24.458]  Even the things they're into, like type A personality as opposed to a type B.
[00:39:25.718 --> 00:39:28.079]  What I'm talking about is the things that they go for.
[00:39:28.159 --> 00:39:31.340]  They're usually successful in civilized society.
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:32.441]  They're real go-getters.
[00:39:32.981 --> 00:39:33.982]  They're doers and shakers.
[00:39:34.382 --> 00:39:39.884]  And then there's the average person who can be very, very intelligent and still not be, quote, successful.
[00:39:40.464 --> 00:39:43.325]  And the majority of the people in the world are the second type.
[00:39:44.086 --> 00:39:49.308]  And if these people are not understood by people who are very aggressive, like Alex,
[00:39:49.864 --> 00:39:51.305]  And he's not going to reach them.
[00:39:51.466 --> 00:39:53.347]  That's all I'm trying to say.
[00:39:53.387 --> 00:39:54.969]  Let me just put it to you this way.
[00:39:55.609 --> 00:40:03.277]  I don't necessarily like the term chattel, cattle, sheeple, but that is what they call us in their own documents, in their own UN documents.
[00:40:03.657 --> 00:40:07.341]  That is what we are referred to, and I think that's why Alex uses the term all the time.
[00:40:07.721 --> 00:40:09.122]  I know that's why I use the term.
[00:40:09.362 --> 00:40:10.584]  Personally, I find it disgusting.
[00:40:11.224 --> 00:40:14.887]  However, I do think that we have maybe earned that title.
[00:40:14.927 --> 00:40:15.468]  I'm sorry.
[00:40:15.548 --> 00:40:27.098]  I mean, when your life revolves around 40 hours of television a week, and then, you know, another 60 hours of work a week, and then you're not even, you don't even know what's going on.
[00:40:27.518 --> 00:40:29.640]  In your own country, let alone geopolitics.
[00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:32.542]  Hey, you might be sheeple and is it going to get to everybody?
[00:40:32.702 --> 00:40:33.203]  Maybe not.
[00:40:33.303 --> 00:40:35.084]  I mean, but there's other flavors of this.
[00:40:35.144 --> 00:40:36.565]  It's not all about Alex Jones.
[00:40:36.825 --> 00:40:38.387]  It's not all about Jason Burmess.
[00:40:38.647 --> 00:40:40.848]  There's plenty of radio talk show hosts out there.
[00:40:41.049 --> 00:40:47.133]  There's just not plenty of people motivated enough to put out the amount of production that Alex has done and be as successful.
[00:40:47.153 --> 00:40:48.414]  And that's why I love his model.
[00:40:49.415 --> 00:40:54.599]  I'm all for all the other people out there spreading this message who may not use that terminology.
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:56.501]  We're not going to wake everybody up.
[00:40:56.561 --> 00:41:04.947]  Hopefully we can wake somebody up and maybe their approach to waking someone up wakes another person up that wouldn't be as susceptible to, say, a road to tyranny or a martial law.
[00:41:05.888 --> 00:41:11.473]  You know, I just used the terminology they used and that's how I'm going to put it.
[00:41:11.513 --> 00:41:13.875]  I mean, are we sheep-like?
[00:41:13.955 --> 00:41:16.096]  Yes, in a lot of ways we are.
[00:41:18.078 --> 00:41:19.399]  I'm guilty too, okay?
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:30.188]  I can't wait to get home and be able to take a couple weeks off and lie down and watch what the Hollywood propagandists have put out on a big screen television.
[00:41:30.228 --> 00:41:30.668]  I'm guilty.
[00:41:30.788 --> 00:41:32.089]  I want to do that.
[00:41:32.269 --> 00:41:33.050]  I long for it.
[00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:39.795]  I long to sit back and hang out with my dogs for a couple days and barbecue and just forget about all this stuff.
[00:41:39.835 --> 00:41:42.077]  But that's not my primary deal.
[00:41:42.417 --> 00:41:45.140]  There are a lot of people that that's what their whole life revolves around
[00:41:45.780 --> 00:42:07.770]  Each day, every day, and that's the huge problem, and that's why we have a mass of, you know, brainwashed, mesmerized, hypnotized people that just want to go along to get along, will stand in a four-hour line for an iPhone, and then pay a ridiculous fee, like I think it's somewhere between like $100 and $200 a month, and you have to sign a two-year contract with them.
[00:42:07.810 --> 00:42:08.251]  I mean, that's...
[00:42:09.051 --> 00:42:10.852]  That's what this society has become.
[00:42:10.952 --> 00:42:12.253]  I thank you for the call, Peggy.
[00:42:12.333 --> 00:42:17.196]  You're always welcome to disagree on this program, and if you tell us you disagree, you go to the head of the line.
[00:42:18.076 --> 00:42:26.181]  Remember, Overdrive is coming up in about 20 minutes with Ralph Nader, going to be broadcast live from Justin.tv.
[00:42:26.241 --> 00:42:27.522]  I'm very excited about that.
[00:42:28.522 --> 00:42:29.763]  Let's continue with your calls.
[00:42:30.143 --> 00:42:32.404]  Let's jump to Dylan in Texas.
[00:42:32.445 --> 00:42:33.025]  Dylan, what's up?
[00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:44.650]  Yeah, I wanted to ask if you're aware if anybody's ever confronted that sheet of a mountain on that article she wrote.
[00:42:49.434 --> 00:42:50.034]  We're good to go.
[00:43:15.228 --> 00:43:16.850]  Yeah, it's titled Just Wondering.
[00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:20.014]  A real easy way to find it is just in quotes type in Just Wondering and Michelle Malkin.
[00:43:30.467 --> 00:43:33.870]  That is before she became O'Reilly's co-host.
[00:43:34.111 --> 00:43:37.954]  That's before she got all this national syndication through Fox Radio.
[00:43:38.355 --> 00:43:44.420]  And it really seems that not so far after that article she totally flipped her position.
[00:43:44.781 --> 00:43:50.686]  And especially years later when the 9-11 Truth Movement became more prominent, that kind of went into the dustbin, didn't it?
[00:43:53.208 --> 00:43:57.132]  Just to answer your question, I don't know of anybody who's confronted her on that article.
[00:43:57.452 --> 00:44:02.236]  Although, that would be a great topic to call into her radio show with on the fly.
[00:44:02.276 --> 00:44:10.544]  You know, again, make up another topic, and then when you get on the air with her, say, you know, I'd really like to go over this article that you wrote called, Just Wondering, six months after the attacks.
[00:44:11.064 --> 00:44:12.785]  Of 9-11 and see if she hangs up on you.
[00:44:12.825 --> 00:44:15.106]  And if she doesn't, keep on pressing, man.
[00:44:15.387 --> 00:44:17.528]  We've got to use their own ammunition against them.
[00:44:17.548 --> 00:44:20.149]  I think that's why, you know, Loose Change is so successful.
[00:44:20.209 --> 00:44:22.250]  I think that's why Fabled Enemies will be successful.
[00:44:22.551 --> 00:44:30.675]  It's because we show you the mainstream news articles and the mainstream media coverage from Fox, CNN, MSNBC, NBC, CBS.
[00:44:30.715 --> 00:44:34.117]  We don't discriminate that contradicts the official version.
[00:44:34.157 --> 00:44:36.219]  I think that's why these films are powerful.
[00:44:36.239 --> 00:44:36.799]  Do you agree?
[00:44:38.057 --> 00:44:39.138]  Absolutely, man.
[00:44:39.158 --> 00:44:42.939]  I think they're just going to keep getting better and better as more info comes out.
[00:44:42.959 --> 00:44:50.303]  I think the accumulation of data over just the last couple of years, you know, you have X amount after a couple of months.
[00:44:50.423 --> 00:44:54.365]  Yeah, it's amazing now with everything you've got now from 2001 to now.
[00:44:54.385 --> 00:44:56.566]  There's going to continue to be more things coming out.
[00:44:58.006 --> 00:45:01.168]  By the time you get a sequel out to any of these films, there's just that much more to
[00:45:02.308 --> 00:45:03.570]  Good.
[00:45:03.610 --> 00:45:05.672]  Keep up the good work and do a great job this week.
[00:45:05.892 --> 00:45:07.353]  Oh yeah, I wanted to make a comment about Chemtrails.
[00:45:19.949 --> 00:45:34.558]  Where I'm living at now, we don't have any, but in Jersey, where I just moved from recently, I'd look up every day and see them, and then it'd be a couple days when you wouldn't see them, and then you'd see a whole bunch the next day.
[00:45:35.299 --> 00:45:44.244]  And literally everybody in the whole neighborhood is just somehow sick a week later at a ridiculous rate around.
[00:45:44.745 --> 00:45:46.446]  Everybody's getting sick.
[00:45:47.486 --> 00:45:52.009]  And it would just rain for three or four days at a time after you seal.
[00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:55.892]  I was wondering if you had any idea about that.
[00:45:55.932 --> 00:46:04.458]  If since they're supposedly also manipulating the weather, does it cause it or they put it in the air and then they make it rain down onto the
[00:46:04.898 --> 00:46:07.100]  Well, how are they dispersing it to the people, in other words?
[00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:09.562]  I mean, are these clouds forming with rain clouds?
[00:46:09.682 --> 00:46:10.042]  Oh, no.
[00:46:10.102 --> 00:46:14.006]  It's not like they flew over and then clouds appeared.
[00:46:14.026 --> 00:46:17.569]  There would just be streams coming from jets overhead.
[00:46:17.609 --> 00:46:17.969]  No, no.
[00:46:18.029 --> 00:46:31.741]  What I'm saying is they would seed the clouds, you would have this big smog, and then actual clouds would come in and it would rain, and people would get sick, probably, from the aluminum, the barium, the magnesium that is contained in these artificial, quote-unquote,
[00:46:32.401 --> 00:46:32.861]  I heard that guy.
[00:46:32.881 --> 00:46:34.602]  I figured I just would call in.
[00:46:34.622 --> 00:46:36.602]  I was trying to call in when she was on.
[00:46:55.167 --> 00:47:03.916]  Yeah, they do get people sick and I can tell you that they seem to only do them in highly populated areas because that was a big city where I'm from.
[00:47:03.996 --> 00:47:06.218]  Now I live in the middle of nowhere and I never see them.
[00:47:07.182 --> 00:47:12.587]  Well, I've got to tell you, I'm in upstate New York, which is about, I don't know, three hours from Manhattan or Jersey.
[00:47:12.687 --> 00:47:15.930]  Actually, it's only about two and a half from the Garden State Parkway.
[00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:24.837]  And, I mean, although it's a college town, there's a couple colleges here, we have a few thousand people here and there, even when the colleges aren't around, they spray there all the time.
[00:47:24.877 --> 00:47:27.499]  But, you may be right, they may not be going into the
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:32.022]  Most rural areas, but I've seen their program really expand in the last five years.
[00:47:32.062 --> 00:47:33.082]  I thank you for the call, Derek.
[00:47:33.742 --> 00:47:36.823]  All right, let's go to Tom in Pennsylvania.
[00:47:36.903 --> 00:47:37.744]  Tom, what's on your mind?
[00:47:38.364 --> 00:47:39.504]  Hey, Jason, how you doing?
[00:47:39.725 --> 00:47:40.045]  Good, man.
[00:47:40.225 --> 00:47:42.666]  I've got a couple of quickies here for you.
[00:47:45.227 --> 00:47:50.809]  On the spring, just here in the Fort County area of Philadelphia,
[00:47:51.536 --> 00:47:59.601]  In the last couple of days, they've been spraying with all kinds of stuff without giving people notice, spraying pesticides and that kind of stuff, using airplanes to do it.
[00:47:59.921 --> 00:48:01.922]  So, you know, I'm not going to dwell on that.
[00:48:02.723 --> 00:48:18.873]  But also on the International Property Code, Maintenance Code, I served on Borough Council for eight years, finished up my second term as of January, and the International Property Maintenance Code was one of those things that was adopted by the borough.
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:32.428]  I kept fighting against it because it says right in there that the code enforcement guy using this property maintenance code can't come into your property without a warrant, without any reasonable cause.
[00:48:32.448 --> 00:48:36.410]  You know, it's just, the guy's right when he was telling you how
[00:48:38.451 --> 00:48:41.494]  And who does it give the authority to?
[00:48:41.554 --> 00:48:44.576]  Is it give it to an international body like the United Nations?
[00:48:45.177 --> 00:48:46.257]  Who is this code under?
[00:48:46.678 --> 00:49:02.010]  Obviously it's under United States law, but if it's an international code, I'm wondering... It's developed by United Nations and some international bodies, non-governmental bodies.
[00:49:04.636 --> 00:49:14.563]  You know, they came up with this thing, and he said, like he says, they can come in and condemn properties for pretty much nothing.
[00:49:14.643 --> 00:49:18.846]  I have a copy, but it's under a pile of stuff here, so I can't find it right now.
[00:49:18.927 --> 00:49:19.027]  Yes.
[00:49:19.087 --> 00:49:20.588]  It's been adopted by most municipalities.
[00:49:28.446 --> 00:49:32.290]  At least here in Pennsylvania, I know a lot of municipalities have adopted it.
[00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:34.051]  Now, I kept it off the books.
[00:49:34.091 --> 00:49:37.054]  They had adopted one back in... It's been around for years, too.
[00:49:37.074 --> 00:49:39.176]  Yeah, he said it's three.
[00:49:40.317 --> 00:49:41.518]  No, it's been around longer than that.
[00:49:41.837 --> 00:49:53.349]  Well, this might have been actually something that Alex Jones covered in America Destroyed by Design back in 1997 when he did his first documentary, and showed the expansion of international power, especially that of the UN.
[00:49:53.389 --> 00:49:59.535]  So, you know, he might be a little more... When he was talking about the 03 code, that's the most recent code.
[00:50:00.555 --> 00:50:23.178]  It's been around since the early 90s, because the Downey Town used to operate under the old 1990s code, whatever that was, and it took them several years, and I ended up, you know, I would get complaints from constituents, or copies of complaints that they would give me, and I would call the constituents and tell them,
[00:50:24.025 --> 00:50:28.169]  This code has not been adopted because they were trying to say that they had adopted the 2003 code.
[00:50:28.249 --> 00:50:30.090]  Basically so they could do whatever they wanted.
[00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:31.491]  I thank you for the call, Tom.
[00:50:31.532 --> 00:50:32.452]  This is very interesting.
[00:50:32.492 --> 00:50:34.154]  Maybe we're going to have to do this whole show.
[00:50:34.214 --> 00:50:35.095]  It's an interesting topic.
[00:50:35.155 --> 00:50:37.016]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:50:37.276 --> 00:50:40.019]  Remember, we'll be back after this and then Overdrive with Ralph Nader.
[00:50:46.633 --> 00:50:48.314]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:50:48.594 --> 00:50:52.036]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:50:52.216 --> 00:50:54.037]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:50:54.677 --> 00:50:57.398]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:50:57.698 --> 00:51:03.181]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:51:03.441 --> 00:51:07.323]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:53.932]  Matthew 24 states four times, in the last days many will be deceived.
[00:51:54.152 --> 00:51:57.433]  There are many ideas about the mark of the beast and the antichrist.
[00:51:57.713 --> 00:52:01.135]  What do you know about the beast, its mark, and the antichrist?
[00:52:01.475 --> 00:52:05.056]  Is the beast a superpower nation or a giant computer in Belgium?
[00:52:05.396 --> 00:52:07.577]  Is its mark an implanted chip, a tattoo,
[00:52:07.917 --> 00:52:08.998]  We're good to go.
[00:52:35.233 --> 00:52:35.753]  We're good.
[00:52:46.605 --> 00:52:56.247]  Since the year 2000, earthquakes, heat waves, droughts, tsunamis, floods, fires and hurricanes have killed over 1 million people worldwide and forced tens of millions to go without food and water.
[00:52:56.427 --> 00:53:00.488]  After Katrina, the media was eager to show victims in New Orleans begging for food.
[00:53:00.608 --> 00:53:05.329]  If a disaster strikes you and your loved ones and you have no stored food, you'll be begging as well.
[00:53:05.589 --> 00:53:11.490]  Now our economy is slipping into an abyss that even Donald Trump says will make the Great Depression look like a Sunday picnic.
[00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:12.171]  The U.S.
[00:53:12.211 --> 00:53:14.893]  dollar is worth less today than it was even last week.
[00:53:15.073 --> 00:53:21.178]  Before food prices skyrocket, trucks stop running and stores close their doors, Survival Enterprises can help you prepare.
[00:53:21.418 --> 00:53:26.182]  They're master distributors of Mountain House freeze-dried food with up to a 50-year shelf life.
[00:53:26.262 --> 00:53:32.648]  Survival Enterprises has real butter, cheese and bread, real beef, chicken and turkey, all canned for long-term storage.
[00:53:32.848 --> 00:53:34.689]  For their website and more info, call 1-800-753-1981.
[00:53:37.892 --> 00:53:38.192]  That's 1-800-753-1981.
[00:53:38.213 --> 00:53:39.875]  And remember, if you wait until you need us, it's too late.
[00:53:39.895 --> 00:53:40.176]  Call now!
[00:53:55.282 --> 00:53:56.343]  It's too bad!
[00:53:56.403 --> 00:53:57.824]  The good guy's lost!
[00:54:12.216 --> 00:54:13.317]  But I ain't gonna lose.
[00:54:13.517 --> 00:54:14.478]  I'm in it to win it, baby.
[00:54:14.838 --> 00:54:17.060]  I'm gonna keep pushing until I win.
[00:54:17.521 --> 00:54:18.201]  Or I'm dead.
[00:54:19.122 --> 00:54:20.944]  Hopefully, I'm looking for the win.
[00:54:20.964 --> 00:54:23.526]  I want to live a very long and fruitful life.
[00:54:23.546 --> 00:54:25.308]  And I know you do, too, out there.
[00:54:26.128 --> 00:54:29.791]  And, you know, I'm not trying to insult people when I talk about the sheeple, but, man!
[00:54:30.552 --> 00:54:31.253]  When we allow...
[00:54:32.711 --> 00:54:39.955]  Not only our nation, but our hearts as human beings to get so far away from what is important in life.
[00:54:40.655 --> 00:54:42.156]  It's hard to call them anything else.
[00:54:42.176 --> 00:54:44.678]  Alright, I'm going to shoot through these last few callers.
[00:54:44.718 --> 00:54:48.540]  And remember, Overdrive with Alex Jones and Ralph Nader following this.
[00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:50.461]  It's only at InfoWars.com.
[00:54:51.342 --> 00:54:58.506]  And you're going to want to listen if you missed any of the show today because Paul Craig Roberts in the first hour was just a tremendous, incredible interview.
[00:54:59.759 --> 00:55:01.141]  And I don't think anybody should miss it.
[00:55:01.181 --> 00:55:03.764]  I'm sure they're going to be doing stories at PrisonPlanet.tv and whatnot.
[00:55:04.645 --> 00:55:12.615]  I also want to remind people that Fabled Enemies drops on PrisonPlanet.tv August 31st and it will be available DVD September 1st.
[00:55:12.635 --> 00:55:16.779]  Order it today so that we can ship it out right away and you can get it in that first week of September.
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:18.261]  If you can't wait that long,
[00:55:19.062 --> 00:55:24.743]  Or if you're willing to wait that long, actually, you can come down to New York City to the big event, September 10th.
[00:55:25.203 --> 00:55:35.206]  Myself and Alex Jones will be showing Fabled Enemies and Truth Rising, and then of course we'll be down at Ground Zero on September 11th, and there are more events during the weekend following September 11th.
[00:55:35.246 --> 00:55:37.166]  Alright, let's jump to Dick in Denver.
[00:55:37.186 --> 00:55:37.847]  Dick, what's on your mind?
[00:55:39.527 --> 00:55:40.707]  Thank you for taking my call.
[00:55:40.947 --> 00:55:42.528]  A couple things real quick.
[00:55:42.548 --> 00:55:43.068]  One is,
[00:55:44.574 --> 00:55:46.195]  You know, I'm living here in Denver.
[00:55:46.615 --> 00:55:48.676]  My son and I are both big supporters.
[00:55:48.736 --> 00:55:50.377]  We're also kind of big guys.
[00:55:50.477 --> 00:55:57.560]  If you want, I can give you my telephone number up there and you can call me back and we'd be happy to watch Alex's back.
[00:55:57.660 --> 00:56:01.242]  I have standing in the 9-11 Truth community here in Denver.
[00:56:01.842 --> 00:56:05.584]  I help the We Are Change people deal with their situation.
[00:56:06.324 --> 00:56:10.066]  When they were arrested for passing out DVDs on the 16th Street Mall.
[00:56:10.127 --> 00:56:19.712]  Let's talk about that really quick, because they were actually arrested for being outside of the mall, handing it out, and they said that they were... What was the term that they used?
[00:56:19.732 --> 00:56:23.295]  They arrested them under some kind of ridiculous... They said that they were peddling without a license.
[00:56:23.315 --> 00:56:26.056]  That's right, peddling, and they weren't selling anything, which is ridiculous.
[00:56:26.116 --> 00:56:31.300]  And I actually took the time to call the district sergeant, the desk sergeant for that district,
[00:56:32.535 --> 00:56:33.297]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:56:42.686 --> 00:56:50.033]  Uh, make it a topic for their agenda at the morning meeting so that they could tell the rest of the officers if you're passing out DVDs.
[00:56:50.433 --> 00:56:52.315]  And of course, you've seen some of the follow-up.
[00:56:52.636 --> 00:56:59.782]  Mark Silverman from the local ACLU wrote a letter and it was published and there was a follow-up to it.
[00:56:59.842 --> 00:57:02.385]  I'm sure the charges will be dropped and he'll be okay.
[00:57:02.905 --> 00:57:10.550]  But there were a few things that you need to be aware of when you're working on the street, such as not having things that you set down on the sidewalk.
[00:57:10.570 --> 00:57:19.936]  You have to pack everything in a backpack and a couple of the little things so that you can't get, you know, arrested on the technicality of obstructing the sidewalk or that kind of thing.
[00:57:20.576 --> 00:57:26.340]  But my son and I would be more than happy to help with security for Alex.
[00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:29.202]  I'll be happy to give you my phone number out there.
[00:57:30.082 --> 00:57:30.843]  The other thing is,
[00:57:31.974 --> 00:57:35.917]  On the sheeple issue, originally we were called citizens.
[00:57:36.197 --> 00:57:39.019]  We're all citizens of the United States of America.
[00:57:39.359 --> 00:57:43.502]  There was a very subtle, very gradual shift to start calling us consumers.
[00:57:44.262 --> 00:57:52.648]  But you must watch out with the term sheeple, because there's a tendency to vilify other people or dehumanize them in one way or another.
[00:57:52.788 --> 00:57:55.670]  Call them a name, and it's easier to dehumanize them.
[00:57:55.830 --> 00:57:56.310]  All right, Dick.
[00:57:56.370 --> 00:57:58.652]  I appreciate the perspective and the phone call.
[00:57:58.672 --> 00:58:00.112]  We're going to have to wrap it up here.
[00:58:01.053 --> 00:58:02.214]  Well, we're really not going anywhere.
[00:58:02.254 --> 00:58:05.938]  If you're over at InfoWars.com, we're going to be streaming live.
[00:58:05.958 --> 00:58:10.142]  Remember, Alex Jones, Ralph Nader coming up from the DNC.
[00:58:11.183 --> 00:58:16.328]  And all week, InfoWars.com has the live feeds, making the news.
[00:58:16.388 --> 00:58:17.990]  That's what we're doing and reporting the truth.
[00:58:18.010 --> 00:58:19.231]  We'll be back tomorrow.
[00:58:24.923 --> 00:58:25.643]  Good job, Jason.
[00:58:25.723 --> 00:58:27.764]  And it's easier to dehumanize them.
[00:58:28.025 --> 00:58:30.966]  Alright, Dick, I appreciate the perspective and the phone call.
[00:58:31.306 --> 00:58:32.367]  We're gonna have to wrap it up here.
[00:58:33.287 --> 00:58:34.488]  But we're really not going anywhere.
[00:58:34.528 --> 00:58:41.191]  If you're over at InfoWars.com... We're gonna fade up the phone lines and see if we can hear them in the background right now.
[00:58:43.012 --> 00:58:45.894]  It's breaking up back and forth, but it looks like they're just setting up the interview.
[00:58:47.214 --> 00:58:48.315]  Yeah, Jason, can you hear me?
[00:58:48.355 --> 00:58:49.195]  Yes, I can, Alex.
[00:58:49.236 --> 00:58:49.916]  How are you doing out there?
[00:58:50.572 --> 00:58:52.173]  Yeah, we've gotten into the hotel.
[00:58:52.213 --> 00:58:55.616]  We've been messing with a lot of feeds, so now we're up here trying to find his room.
[00:58:56.096 --> 00:59:00.960]  We're bumbling around in this giant double hotel with passages across the road.
[00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:06.144]  Those hotels are two buildings, so we're running around looking for the room right now.
[00:59:06.404 --> 00:59:09.467]  So just keep talking, and we should be in there in the next five minutes, but we've got to set up.
[00:59:09.487 --> 00:59:12.789]  Probably about 15 minutes after is when we'll be doing this, okay?
[00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:14.270]  Alright, sounds good.
[00:59:16.092 --> 00:59:18.093]  Alright, so we're going to fade that down for the next 15 minutes.
[00:59:20.185 --> 00:59:25.807]  I want to read this mashable blogger lie about Alex Jones right now.
[00:59:28.788 --> 00:59:30.209]  This is just ridiculous.
[00:59:30.409 --> 00:59:33.870]  Blogger Michelle Malkin attacked in Denver near DNCOA.
[00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:35.071]  First of all, no one attacked her.
[00:59:36.131 --> 00:59:39.553]  No one physically put their hands on Michelle Malkin.
[00:59:40.673 --> 00:59:42.414]  Michelle Malkin does not make that claim either.
[00:59:44.858 --> 00:59:53.100]  Conservative blogger Michelle Malkin was beset by a horde of self-described leftists and anarchists not far from the site of the Democratic National Convention earlier today.
[00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:59.281]  The mob was led by well-known left-wing conspiracy theory radio show host Alex Jones.
[00:59:59.441 --> 01:00:01.161]  Say he's a left-winger, folks.
[01:00:01.941 --> 01:00:05.602]  Of course, we know he is not left-wing whatsoever.
[01:00:06.582 --> 01:00:13.824]  Who was at the protest, and again, he was not at the protest designed to, and I'm not exaggerating at all, levitate the Denver Mint.
[01:00:13.884 --> 01:00:13.984]  No.
[01:00:14.955 --> 01:00:17.796]  First of all, he was walking through the DNC.
[01:00:17.816 --> 01:00:19.877]  He wasn't, quote-unquote, at the protest.
[01:00:19.897 --> 01:00:21.658]  He didn't surround the Denver Mint.
[01:00:21.698 --> 01:00:23.858]  He didn't try to levitate anything.
[01:00:24.179 --> 01:00:28.000]  He was there to show what morons these guys are!
[01:00:29.321 --> 01:00:33.802]  And how absurd the idea of Recreate 68 is!
[01:00:35.663 --> 01:00:41.625]  Not only did they fail, folks, at inciting the violent riots that they wish to do,
[01:00:44.304 --> 01:01:03.887]  But, unbelievably, they made themselves look ludicrous by dressing up like Mickey Mouse from Fantasia and saying they're going to use their magical powers to get rid of the Denver Mint that prints some of the money in this country.
[01:01:04.921 --> 01:01:06.442]  I hate these anti-capitalists.
[01:01:07.043 --> 01:01:11.306]  I'm not saying we even have true capitalism in America anymore, but I ain't no socialist.
[01:01:11.546 --> 01:01:12.407]  I'm no communist.
[01:01:13.088 --> 01:01:17.071]  I believe that people that work harder and are smarter should make more money.
[01:01:18.152 --> 01:01:19.853]  People with bigger and better ideas.
[01:01:21.615 --> 01:01:22.816]  It's the American Dream, baby!
[01:01:23.871 --> 01:01:29.117]  And I don't think that we should all get the same amount of money and the same amount of rations and live in the same kind of house.
[01:01:29.137 --> 01:01:30.239]  It doesn't work that way.
[01:01:30.539 --> 01:01:31.821]  People are not the same.
[01:01:32.181 --> 01:01:33.423]  Some are not motivated.
[01:01:34.244 --> 01:01:42.233]  Some of you right now are sitting there, unfortunately, with your big old belly, sucking down some chips.
[01:01:43.339 --> 01:01:46.382]  Probably one of those Dunkin Donuts Coolatas.
[01:01:46.742 --> 01:01:49.245]  It's got like 9,000 calories in it.
[01:01:49.665 --> 01:01:51.167]  Just not caring about anything.
[01:01:51.347 --> 01:01:54.270]  Just like, ah, you know, you're informed but you're not going to do anything.
[01:01:55.010 --> 01:02:01.997]  Now there are other people that are listening to this broadcast and they're finding the most interesting information on it and they're writing blogs and they're spreading the truth.
[01:02:02.478 --> 01:02:03.699]  There are yet other people
[01:02:04.977 --> 01:02:05.417]  We're good to go.
[01:02:24.953 --> 01:02:26.294]  Or find a way to New York City.
[01:02:26.334 --> 01:02:30.559]  Maybe I just plugged that right now and somebody said, you know what, maybe I am going to go to New York.
[01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:32.101]  I'm going to find a way down there.
[01:02:32.181 --> 01:02:33.362]  I want to talk to these people.
[01:02:33.723 --> 01:02:35.905]  I want to be part of what's going down.
[01:02:36.266 --> 01:02:40.250]  I want to combat the propaganda that the mainstream media keeps pushing on us.
[01:02:42.148 --> 01:02:51.675]  People to know that both Obama and McCain, when they go to New York City for their quote-unquote forum for the family members, are there to grandstand.
[01:02:52.236 --> 01:02:53.557]  They're not there for you and me.
[01:02:54.077 --> 01:02:56.539]  They're not there to promote ideas of freedom.
[01:02:57.180 --> 01:03:02.083]  They're there to take advantage of a situation and have a media highlight.
[01:03:02.904 --> 01:03:03.785]  That's what they're there for.
[01:03:04.285 --> 01:03:07.648]  They're there to further take control of our minds.
[01:03:08.717 --> 01:03:12.100]  And I guess I'm taking a lot of heat for using the term sheeple.
[01:03:13.941 --> 01:03:15.062]  And maybe rightfully so.
[01:03:15.182 --> 01:03:15.482]  Who knows?
[01:03:15.522 --> 01:03:16.183]  I'm not perfect.
[01:03:16.243 --> 01:03:17.144]  I'm just a human being.
[01:03:17.364 --> 01:03:18.605]  I'm going to make mistakes, folks.
[01:03:19.405 --> 01:03:20.746]  I am no deity.
[01:03:21.007 --> 01:03:22.448]  I don't want you to worship me.
[01:03:22.528 --> 01:03:24.109]  That's another thing that really pisses me off.
[01:03:24.469 --> 01:03:26.130]  When I hear these people say that 9-11 is a cult.
[01:03:26.151 --> 01:03:27.151]  9-11 Truth is a cult.
[01:03:27.792 --> 01:03:28.012]  Really?
[01:03:28.032 --> 01:03:28.132]  Is it?
[01:03:30.979 --> 01:03:36.087]  I forgot I was telling people to worship me or send me money and I'm living in an evangelist's home.
[01:03:36.348 --> 01:03:41.336]  I mean, how ridiculous is it that they try to equate us with, like, occultism?
[01:03:42.642 --> 01:03:43.702]  Like a literal cult!
[01:03:44.402 --> 01:03:48.563]  Like we have some kind of leader that we're giving our money to and we dress up in a certain outfit.
[01:03:48.623 --> 01:03:48.844]  No.
[01:03:49.224 --> 01:03:56.966]  When we put on an Investigate 9-11 shirt or a 9-11 was an inside job shirt, that's to show our solidarity.
[01:03:57.546 --> 01:03:58.306]  That's at an event.
[01:03:58.326 --> 01:03:59.426]  We don't wear them every day.
[01:03:59.726 --> 01:04:02.587]  You know, we... Man, the cult thing is just... It's gross, man.
[01:04:04.998 --> 01:04:05.539]  All right.
[01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:09.982]  Let's go back to this article that's just making me nauseous.
[01:04:10.743 --> 01:04:13.505]  The Mob was organized under the banner, Recreate 68.
[01:04:13.545 --> 01:04:14.006]  The Mob.
[01:04:14.066 --> 01:04:18.930]  It wasn't even a mob, it was a bunch of just jackassery is what that whole thing was.
[01:04:19.350 --> 01:04:25.075]  With the goal of reigniting the riots of 1968 around the Chicago Democratic Convention.
[01:04:25.375 --> 01:04:33.062]  And they did try to do it, but they were unsuccessful because of people like Jonathan Elanoff's efforts, and my efforts, and Alex Jones's efforts, and you know,
[01:04:34.147 --> 01:04:34.848]  We exposed him!
[01:04:35.509 --> 01:04:38.393]  Thousands of people didn't want to show up to something that was provocateur.
[01:04:38.713 --> 01:04:42.519]  That was, you know, put there to try to incite violence.
[01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:45.062]  Alright, so here they come lying about Alex again.
[01:04:45.162 --> 01:04:50.830]  Alex Jones is indeed a left-wing blogger with an army of left-wing bloggers under his new media umbrella.
[01:04:52.177 --> 01:04:55.439]  I'm in the office and we're not left-wing.
[01:04:55.919 --> 01:04:56.820]  Aaron ain't left-wing.
[01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:57.981]  I ain't left-wing.
[01:04:58.661 --> 01:05:00.022]  Kurt Nemo ain't left-wing.
[01:05:00.782 --> 01:05:03.484]  Paul and Steve Watson ain't left-wing.
[01:05:04.164 --> 01:05:04.544]  Okay?
[01:05:04.965 --> 01:05:06.646]  Do we sometimes link to the Raw Story?
[01:05:06.686 --> 01:05:06.866]  Sure.
[01:05:06.886 --> 01:05:08.547]  Do we sometimes link to Counterpunch?
[01:05:08.587 --> 01:05:08.767]  Sure.
[01:05:08.807 --> 01:05:10.908]  Do we sometimes link to the Huffington Post?
[01:05:10.928 --> 01:05:11.268]  You bet!
[01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:13.630]  But do we also link to Fox News?
[01:05:13.730 --> 01:05:14.030]  Yes.
[01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:15.111]  CNN?
[01:05:15.151 --> 01:05:15.491]  You bet.
[01:05:18.439 --> 01:05:26.102]  Anything that's telling a speck of the truth, we will link to, we will report on, and it has nothing to do with being left or right.
[01:05:26.643 --> 01:05:44.531]  He is the curator of a number of new media websites, often cited by the left, including, often cited, again, it's always left, left, left, right, right, right, conservative, conservative, liberal, liberal, Republican, Democrat, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, you gotta choose a side, you gotta choose a side, no you don't!
[01:05:45.251 --> 01:05:46.492]  Have to choose one of those sides.
[01:05:46.512 --> 01:05:49.013]  They are false paradigm sides.
[01:05:49.993 --> 01:05:50.394]  Okay?
[01:05:51.054 --> 01:05:55.796]  They are used to try to get you on their team, and the teams are owned by the same guy.
[01:05:56.056 --> 01:05:58.317]  The same guy owns both teams.
[01:05:58.678 --> 01:05:59.318]  Do you get it?
[01:06:00.378 --> 01:06:02.860]  When they compete against each other, it's a joke.
[01:06:06.742 --> 01:06:11.364]  Jones, accompanied by a little more than a handful of protesters that showed up for the event, again,
[01:06:12.486 --> 01:06:14.788]  The protesters were not with Alex Jones.
[01:06:16.090 --> 01:06:23.337]  The people who knew who Alex Jones were could hardly be considered a mob or a handful.
[01:06:23.597 --> 01:06:24.939]  He was with his two camera guys.
[01:06:25.179 --> 01:06:30.925]  And of course, people are going to go up to Alex because he's a radio or TV personality.
[01:06:31.205 --> 01:06:33.367]  These aren't the same people that were trying to lift the mint.
[01:06:33.948 --> 01:06:34.589]  It's ridiculous.
[01:06:36.345 --> 01:06:37.545]  Now here's where it gets into big lies.
[01:06:37.965 --> 01:06:48.367]  Jones, accompanied by a little more than a handful of protesters that showed up for the event, were documented chanting, kill Michelle Malkin, only moments after chanting their previous refrain of love, peace, and justice.
[01:06:48.687 --> 01:07:01.170]  Again, the people that were shouting, kill Michelle Malkin, left with Michelle Malkin, and they were wearing ridiculous outfits, again, had an Obama beret and some other ridiculous hat.
[01:07:02.739 --> 01:07:04.080]  And they're the provocateurs.
[01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:11.144]  And I don't know if they were part of that protest or not, or they're just, you know, well-meaning idiots or morons.
[01:07:12.284 --> 01:07:14.946]  But of course they put their pictures up.
[01:07:16.081 --> 01:07:18.503]  Just totally and completely idiotic.
[01:07:19.283 --> 01:07:35.574]  After shouting orders to his followers to not let Michelle Malkin leave, Alex Jones, in a small mob of protesters followed by a much larger mob of press, harangued and screamed a bevy of personal and ideological attacks for a number of blocks as the diminutive Malkin attempted to calmly flee the scene.
[01:07:36.354 --> 01:07:42.416]  But for a bit of shoving, a lot of yelling, and a number of intimidation tactics, no physical violence directly against Malkin took place.
[01:07:42.696 --> 01:07:48.438]  But as the video captured by Pajamas Media reporters on the scene shows, it could have been a picnic.
[01:07:49.278 --> 01:07:50.919]  It couldn't have been a picnic for Michelle.
[01:07:51.279 --> 01:07:53.379]  Oh, poor Michelle Malkin.
[01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:54.760]  Please.
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:56.420]  She's a little demon.
[01:07:56.460 --> 01:07:56.820]  Who cares?
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:59.461]  I don't care if she's five foot nothing, a hundred and nothing.
[01:07:59.701 --> 01:08:04.223]  Her mouth is big enough to reach millions of people and tell them that torture is okay.
[01:08:05.051 --> 01:08:08.152]  To keep pressing the fear of the boogeyman.
[01:08:08.312 --> 01:08:11.814]  To promote martial law and internment camps for Americans.
[01:08:12.414 --> 01:08:19.698]  To give a free pass to soldiers, whether or not they're killing innocent civilians over there, or animals.
[01:08:20.018 --> 01:08:20.618]  Give me a break.
[01:08:21.538 --> 01:08:23.319]  Oh, poor Michelle Malkin.
[01:08:23.359 --> 01:08:24.780]  I feel so bad for her.
[01:08:26.448 --> 01:08:37.194]  What's most irritating is that once again tactics that originate from left-wing bloggers have bled into meat space and painted a picture that puts the new media in a poor light.
[01:08:37.294 --> 01:08:38.135]  Come on!
[01:08:39.122 --> 01:08:41.723]  Left-wing, left-wing, we're not left-wing.
[01:08:41.763 --> 01:08:44.945]  I think they probably used the term left-wing about four more times in this short article.
[01:08:45.505 --> 01:08:50.528]  Of course, I'm referring to the lousy vetting process that was in place during the Republican primary YouTube debates.
[01:08:51.028 --> 01:09:03.695]  It was discovered during the broadcast of the show that one of the questionnaires was a plant from one of the Democratic campaigns, and a careful analysis of the rest of the bunch showed up that almost half of the questionnaires were Democratic plants, staffers, organizers, or bloggers.
[01:09:04.095 --> 01:09:04.776]  No shock there.
[01:09:05.076 --> 01:09:06.697]  Same thing goes on with your right-wing guy.
[01:09:08.114 --> 01:09:10.015]  That might be the one thing he got right in this article.
[01:09:10.835 --> 01:09:15.937]  But again, it's all about attacking the other side, so maybe that would be the only part that has to actually be right.
[01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:19.579]  Let's jump down a little bit.
[01:09:19.999 --> 01:09:27.763]  Interestingly, it seems that despite being present for the threats, the Denver Police took no action against Alex Jones or any of the other protesters calling for the death of Ms.
[01:09:27.803 --> 01:09:28.103]  Malkin.
[01:09:28.203 --> 01:09:31.885]  Again, Alex Jones did not call for the death of Michelle Malkin!
[01:09:32.345 --> 01:09:32.905]  It's clear!
[01:09:33.025 --> 01:09:33.785]  It's on video!
[01:09:34.006 --> 01:09:34.666]  Give me a break!
[01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:38.602]  Of course, why would the police arrest him?
[01:09:39.122 --> 01:09:41.024]  He walked up and started making a statement.
[01:09:41.744 --> 01:09:42.845]  She's a public figure.
[01:09:42.905 --> 01:09:43.846]  She's on the news.
[01:09:44.286 --> 01:09:45.287]  She spreads her lies.
[01:09:45.327 --> 01:09:46.208]  She's an author.
[01:09:47.428 --> 01:09:50.631]  He has every right to go up to her and exercise his free speech.
[01:09:53.198 --> 01:09:53.758]  Oh, man.
[01:09:53.838 --> 01:10:03.246]  Instead of taking the position of some of the liberals in the blogosphere, the best move for Democratic-aligned bloggers would be to immediately denounce the actions of Alex Jones.
[01:10:03.686 --> 01:10:06.028]  So Democrats, don't link to Alex.
[01:10:06.329 --> 01:10:07.389]  That's the next message.
[01:10:07.810 --> 01:10:18.279]  Let's shred it into two sides, right and left, Republican and Democrat, and then encourage the Democrats not to go to Jones whatsoever.
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:19.880]  Interesting.
[01:10:22.715 --> 01:10:23.976]  The actions of Alex Jones.
[01:10:24.617 --> 01:10:26.479]  Of course the right will denounce Jones and company.
[01:10:26.539 --> 01:10:27.319]  No they won't!
[01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:31.463]  No, you're little fake right-wing minions.
[01:10:31.983 --> 01:10:36.227]  You're O'Reilly's, you're Hannity's, you're Limbaugh's.
[01:10:36.247 --> 01:10:38.609]  Yeah, they'll denounce Alex Jones or they won't bring it up at all.
[01:10:38.669 --> 01:10:39.130]  Good for them.
[01:10:40.471 --> 01:10:41.772]  Do we have Alex coming in now?
[01:10:41.952 --> 01:10:47.377]  Is that what... Okay, I guess that we're going to go to the JustinTV feed right now.
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:53.081]  Yep, and we'll pull it up and we'll see if this interview has started.
[01:10:54.302 --> 01:10:59.443]  Again, you can see this over at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:11:01.704 --> 01:11:05.425]  And hopefully in about three minutes we're going to have the Nader interview live for you.
[01:11:07.225 --> 01:11:08.426]  Revolutionary radio, folks.
[01:11:09.606 --> 01:11:11.547]  And Alex Jones has really made the most of it.
[01:11:12.687 --> 01:11:16.088]  Hopefully Inside Edition's piece will not be a total hit brigade, but
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:25.644]  I don't have too much confidence in the mainstream media, and I know most of you listeners out there also do not have too much confidence in the mainstream media.
[01:11:25.684 --> 01:11:26.465]  Not that they've earned it.
[01:11:28.786 --> 01:11:32.388]  And of course, the end line of this terrible, terrible, liable article.
[01:11:33.108 --> 01:11:34.289]  And it is liable, by the way.
[01:11:35.729 --> 01:11:44.694]  Those that use Jones's sources on a regular basis would do good to distance themselves from this sort of ridiculous behavior or risk being painted with the same brush.
[01:11:46.874 --> 01:11:47.875]  And what brush might that be?
[01:11:48.355 --> 01:11:49.296]  The brush of freedom?
[01:11:50.117 --> 01:11:53.440]  The, uh, brush of democracy?
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:56.082]  The brush of a constitutional republic?
[01:11:56.462 --> 01:11:58.184]  The brush of free speech?
[01:11:58.444 --> 01:12:02.527]  The brush of new media taking over the corporate controlled media?
[01:12:02.888 --> 01:12:07.972]  And I'm sick of the bull crap that this is somehow new media that she's with.
[01:12:08.052 --> 01:12:09.213]  Pajamas media.
[01:12:09.493 --> 01:12:10.614]  BLEGH!
[01:12:11.635 --> 01:12:12.996]  Go to bed, pajamas, please.
[01:12:13.657 --> 01:12:14.458]  It's absolutely
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:16.982]  Unbelievably disgusting.
[01:12:17.502 --> 01:12:29.456]  See, what they're doing is they're trying to have their little subsects of neocon worshippers, probably what those two little anarchists, your fake anarchists, were, you know, their little provocateurs, they think it's funny.
[01:12:30.478 --> 01:12:32.800]  And it is just, it's beyond disturbing to me.
[01:12:33.461 --> 01:12:35.864]  Beyond disturbing.
[01:12:39.158 --> 01:12:50.785]  That these sickos are going to present like these other blogs that are, you know, little green footballs and all these other... God, I just... I'm getting sick.
[01:12:52.205 --> 01:12:59.509]  They just sit there and they rant about how great the neocons are, and how we just need to go and kill everybody.
[01:13:00.590 --> 01:13:07.014]  And everything that George Bush and his administration have done is the best thing since breakfast, and Dick Cheney is a hero, and you know,
[01:13:08.477 --> 01:13:10.578]  What's going on with this Karl Rove situation?
[01:13:11.158 --> 01:13:12.099]  I'm not quite sure.
[01:13:12.139 --> 01:13:14.540]  I know that he left the country on subpoena.
[01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:15.680]  He's obviously back.
[01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:23.244]  I saw him on O'Reilly last night at the DNC, proving once again that these people are above the law.
[01:13:24.144 --> 01:13:26.025]  It's just like when Libby gets convicted.
[01:13:26.665 --> 01:13:27.425]  Convicted!
[01:13:28.606 --> 01:13:32.388]  In a court of law of releasing the name of Valerie Plame.
[01:13:33.425 --> 01:14:02.527]  and you know helping in this you know really rather minor conspiracy to try to uh... discredit claim in her claims against the uh... the uranium the uh... enriched uranium in niger which was completely and totally false of course so he gets jail time okay most of the jurors know that cheney is involved also what happens george bush commutes a sentence he doesn't even re wait for uh...
[01:14:04.116 --> 01:14:05.817]  And we know Clinton did it with many a people.
[01:14:26.684 --> 01:14:28.204]  Bush is going to do it with many people.
[01:14:28.784 --> 01:14:43.547]  But that's how transparent the evil is, that they can do this in public, in your face, on television, for all to see, and still, you know, still, nothing is done.
[01:14:44.248 --> 01:14:46.708]  Rove still parades around like he's some kind of hero.
[01:14:47.928 --> 01:14:48.688]  He goes on TV.
[01:14:51.693 --> 01:14:57.540]  It's outlandish, it's unacceptable, and it should be infuriating to all the listeners out there.
[01:14:58.421 --> 01:15:02.927]  You should literally have your fist clenched like this and have it beat red and beam.
[01:15:03.007 --> 01:15:04.048]  Why are we taking this?
[01:15:04.749 --> 01:15:06.131]  What the hell is going on?
[01:15:06.992 --> 01:15:07.572]  But you're not.
[01:15:08.574 --> 01:15:09.254]  You're sitting back.
[01:15:10.276 --> 01:15:10.977]  You're relaxing.
[01:15:11.857 --> 01:15:13.638]  And you're like, oh, this is really scary.
[01:15:13.658 --> 01:15:14.558]  I don't know if I can do it.
[01:15:14.618 --> 01:15:15.258]  OK, are we good?
[01:15:15.598 --> 01:15:18.639]  OK, it seems that I'm going to be able to fade the phone line up right now.
[01:15:18.699 --> 01:15:21.940]  And we're going to get to, no, we're looking for the Justin.TV feed.
[01:15:22.961 --> 01:15:25.202]  All right, well, I'm still not getting it at all.
[01:15:25.942 --> 01:15:30.183]  OK, so as soon as I have the Justin.TV feed, we will go to it.
[01:15:30.543 --> 01:15:32.164]  It is not working for some reason.
[01:15:33.064 --> 01:15:34.805]  I'm going to try to restart my Firefox.
[01:15:36.064 --> 01:15:37.605]  Yes, I am on 1360 North of Denver.
[01:15:37.625 --> 01:15:39.766]  The Lion is the station that carries it here.
[01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:58.823]  We're live on the radio, that feed over a wireless card sending video out to the phone and forwarding.
[01:15:59.724 --> 01:16:00.044]  Yes, sir.
[01:16:00.145 --> 01:16:00.505]  Well, yes.
[01:16:00.585 --> 01:16:02.246]  I mean, they're waiting to go live.
[01:16:02.266 --> 01:16:03.267]  People on the web are watching live.
[01:16:03.287 --> 01:16:06.350]  We're going to go live on the radio show in just a moment.
[01:16:07.050 --> 01:16:08.832]  Mr. Nader, it's really great to speak with you.
[01:16:08.852 --> 01:16:09.252]  We're live.
[01:16:09.272 --> 01:16:10.213]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:16:10.373 --> 01:16:11.814]  Thanks for taking ten minutes out of our time.
[01:16:11.834 --> 01:16:13.956]  I see you've got media lined up down the hall here to talk to you.
[01:16:15.637 --> 01:16:22.903]  I've looked at the two candidates, Barack Obama and, of course, John McCain, and I really don't see a lot of differences.
[01:16:23.730 --> 01:16:29.274]  Can you compare yourself to both John McCain and to, of course, Barack Obama, please, sir?
[01:16:30.375 --> 01:16:34.999]  Well, I think they're both John McCain Incorporated and Barack Obama Incorporated.
[01:16:35.399 --> 01:16:46.328]  I think they have deferred the hopes and dreams and necessities of the American people to dialing for corporate dollars and doing the demands of the corporate lobby.
[01:16:46.668 --> 01:16:49.950]  Having said that, obviously they have different personalities and temperaments.
[01:16:50.611 --> 01:16:53.393]  For example, if you get John McCain angry,
[01:16:54.167 --> 01:16:57.328]  And you're a defense contractor, and he's president.
[01:16:57.648 --> 01:16:58.068]  Watch out.
[01:16:58.648 --> 01:17:00.748]  It doesn't matter what the other Republicans will say.
[01:17:01.108 --> 01:17:06.869]  Just the way he went out after that Boeing tanker $19 billion deal as senator.
[01:17:07.709 --> 01:17:16.891]  Barack Obama, if he becomes president, he's going to have a harder time saying no to African Americans, poor, hot whites, and Latinos.
[01:17:17.371 --> 01:17:17.651]  Why?
[01:17:17.671 --> 01:17:21.772]  Because they're going to say, hey, you're supposed to represent our interests.
[01:17:22.185 --> 01:17:25.186]  You becoming president is not just another career move, you know?
[01:17:25.206 --> 01:17:26.927]  It's supposed to make a difference.
[01:17:27.707 --> 01:17:33.890]  With McCain, you're going to get a perpetual war candidate.
[01:17:34.610 --> 01:17:43.153]  I don't know where he got his aggressiveness and his militarism, given his experiences in Vietnam, but it's demeaning to him.
[01:17:43.794 --> 01:17:51.837]  And I think he's got to come forward with the same kind of fervor in waging peace and putting forth the humanitarian
[01:17:52.498 --> 01:17:53.099]  I don't know.
[01:18:15.066 --> 01:18:22.709]  What would you do if you were president with the warrantless wiretaps, with the rendition, Guantanamo Bay, all the horrible police state developments we've seen, sir?
[01:18:22.909 --> 01:18:24.049]  I would stop the war crimes.
[01:18:24.589 --> 01:18:25.790]  That's what he has to face.
[01:18:25.970 --> 01:18:33.673]  How, if he becomes president, is he going to stop the continuation of Bush-Cheney's war crimes and the violation of our Constitution?
[01:18:34.013 --> 01:18:37.094]  That means no wiretapping without judicial approval.
[01:18:37.154 --> 01:18:40.415]  You can get it very quickly and retroactively with the vice of court.
[01:18:41.278 --> 01:18:45.602]  That is a violation of federal law without a judicial warrant.
[01:18:45.642 --> 01:18:47.964]  You know, it carries a maximum five year jail term.
[01:18:48.624 --> 01:18:58.732]  That means do not head into the hottest, hottest hornet's nest in the world, which is the mountains of Afghanistan and Pakistan with our soldiers.
[01:18:59.193 --> 01:19:00.974]  No one has ever conquered that area.
[01:19:01.254 --> 01:19:06.939]  The British tried, the Russians tried under the Soviet era, and we're not going to be able to do it.
[01:19:07.379 --> 01:19:08.080]  And the third is,
[01:19:08.567 --> 01:19:11.649]  Withdrawing from Iraq, but leaving 50,000 soldiers there?
[01:19:11.669 --> 01:19:13.911]  And leaving military bases there?
[01:19:14.271 --> 01:19:16.552]  How's that going to knock the bottom out of the insurgency?
[01:19:16.572 --> 01:19:17.753]  Well, that's doublespeak, isn't it?
[01:19:18.113 --> 01:19:19.114]  Of course it's doublespeak.
[01:19:19.674 --> 01:19:23.937]  And as Military Aid basically said, there'll be 50,000 to 80,000 soldiers there.
[01:19:24.718 --> 01:19:28.880]  And the corporate contractors will stay there, because they're maintaining the military bases.
[01:19:29.241 --> 01:19:32.123]  Halliburton, KBR, Blackwater.
[01:19:33.283 --> 01:19:37.266]  I think Barack Obama is trying to talk out of both sides of his mouth.
[01:19:38.021 --> 01:19:40.521]  Mr. Nader, you've run for president before.
[01:19:40.541 --> 01:19:42.582]  Why are you running for president again?
[01:19:42.602 --> 01:19:45.502]  You know, the control corporate press says, oh, the perennial candidate.
[01:19:46.042 --> 01:19:47.203]  Why are you running for president?
[01:19:47.583 --> 01:19:48.983]  Because I want to improve my country.
[01:19:49.463 --> 01:19:50.763]  I want to help the American people.
[01:19:51.303 --> 01:20:05.486]  I want to take the solutions off the shelf, which are great solutions to affordable housing, public transit, pollution cleanup, solar energy, and put them on the ground and give the American people more small business, more entrepreneurship,
[01:20:05.925 --> 01:20:13.952]  More rights as workers and the freedom to form trade unions and to put our foot forward in the world where the best of America is seen.
[01:20:14.212 --> 01:20:24.982]  Not napalm cluster bombs to the Israelis and more weapons of mass destruction sold to countries that are often run by dictators who use these weapons against their own people.
[01:20:25.182 --> 01:20:27.704]  And we wonder why people in the third world hate us?
[01:20:28.174 --> 01:20:29.735]  Well, we're glad that you're running for president.
[01:20:29.755 --> 01:20:32.496]  I know a lot of the viewers and listeners out there as well.
[01:20:32.516 --> 01:20:36.138]  And you look at the polls, you see Congress with its lowest approval rating in history.
[01:20:36.178 --> 01:20:36.998]  Gallup Poll reported 9%.
[01:20:37.778 --> 01:20:38.779]  Cheney's got a 9%.
[01:20:39.199 --> 01:20:40.720]  Bush a 22%.
[01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:42.040]  The Democrats are unpopular.
[01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:46.942]  Because you have the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the American people are all together on what they want.
[01:20:47.283 --> 01:20:47.823]  It's funny.
[01:20:48.303 --> 01:20:54.546]  Constitutional positions happen to be very popular with the people, but we have the two-party dictatorship going forward.
[01:20:55.187 --> 01:21:03.631]  And certainly, by running, you are helping to inject real issues into the debate, similar to what Ron Paul did on the other side of the spectrum, but almost meeting very close.
[01:21:03.771 --> 01:21:07.954]  Alex Jones, you're one of the few radio talk shows that ever says what you just said.
[01:21:08.774 --> 01:21:12.476]  What you are saying is, let many voices be heard.
[01:21:12.916 --> 01:21:15.978]  Let the First Amendment be used by all Americans.
[01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:18.000]  Open up the debate process.
[01:21:18.220 --> 01:21:19.901]  Why are we limiting presidential debates?
[01:21:19.941 --> 01:21:21.481]  We don't limit weather reports.
[01:21:21.521 --> 01:21:23.102]  We don't limit entertainment.
[01:21:23.122 --> 01:21:24.122]  We don't limit sports.
[01:21:24.142 --> 01:21:25.042]  That was my next question.
[01:21:25.222 --> 01:21:31.764]  I want, uh, you are really here to bring attention to the fact that we have this corporate monopoly that's hijacked the public trust for debates.
[01:21:31.924 --> 01:21:36.505]  Can you speak with your particular expertise at that, being locked out of debates that you were invited to?
[01:21:36.765 --> 01:21:45.767]  Even though national poll after national poll from 2001 had me on the debate, Buchanan on the debate, they want more people on the stage than, you know,
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:54.783]  Two major candidates that are basically spouting the same old slogans that they spouted weeks before on the campaign trail.
[01:21:54.803 --> 01:21:55.744]  They're not really debates.
[01:21:55.824 --> 01:21:57.024]  They're parallel interviews.
[01:21:57.445 --> 01:22:06.449]  And the Debate Commission is a private company created 21 years ago to get rid of the League of Women Voters, which sponsored debates, controlled by the Republican-Democrat Party.
[01:22:06.509 --> 01:22:09.230]  To this day, they pick the format of the debate.
[01:22:09.410 --> 01:22:11.971]  They pick the reporters who will ask the questions.
[01:22:12.651 --> 01:22:14.492]  And naturally, they know how to pick them.
[01:22:14.512 --> 01:22:16.293]  Well, it seems they're more scared of
[01:22:17.316 --> 01:22:25.660]  Letting a third party or an individual like yourself, you know, who has the gravitas and the history, you know, to really challenge it again, because more than ever, the Kibari system is under threat.
[01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:36.545]  They know the people are wising up to them, so there's no way they can let Ralph Nader in there, because if they did, you could capture the minds of the people, and, you know, capture their attention and their imagination, and then we could actually get some change in this country.
[01:22:36.645 --> 01:22:39.826]  Nader Gonzales were on the three major presidential debates, Alex.
[01:22:39.886 --> 01:22:40.987]  It would be a three-way race.
[01:22:41.840 --> 01:23:02.574]  The CNN poll has us at 6%, and we would go up quite rapidly with tens of millions of people finding out that we're actually running, finding out what we're running on, finding out that our rhetoric is based on a record of challenging the big boys for 40 years for the health, safety, and economic well-being of the American people.
[01:23:02.834 --> 01:23:08.958]  That's the Nader Gonzalez ticket, and that's the theme of our Super Rally during the Democratic National Convention week.
[01:23:09.398 --> 01:23:10.500]  In Denver.
[01:23:26.538 --> 01:23:29.559]  Ike O'Reilly, Sean Penn, and so many others.
[01:23:29.579 --> 01:23:31.760]  Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine.
[01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:34.060]  Absolutely, big fan of his that are coming up tonight.
[01:23:34.580 --> 01:23:53.466]  But my final question for you is this, did you, I should have asked this before the interview, I didn't have a chance, did you see Cy Hirst before that big media conference three weeks ago, and then the New Yorker reported on him but didn't give the details, but his White House sources, we know how credible he is, said that Dick Cheney, a few months before,
[01:23:54.379 --> 01:24:04.909]  Right after they tried to stage that event in the Strait of Hormuz between Iran and Iraq with a fake radio chatter, tried to paint up, wanted to paint up U.S.
[01:24:05.109 --> 01:24:12.496]  boats like Iranian blue patrol boats and have Navy SEALs, quote, have a shootout between larger U.S.
[01:24:12.516 --> 01:24:14.698]  naval vessels as a false flag event.
[01:24:14.778 --> 01:24:15.499]  A, did you hear of that?
[01:24:15.739 --> 01:24:16.840]  And B, what is your take on it?
[01:24:17.634 --> 01:24:25.337]  I think that Dick Cheney is a multiple warhead, criminal recidivist, as Vice President, together with his President George H.W.
[01:24:25.357 --> 01:24:32.219]  Bush, who violated our Constitution, our federal statutes, and international treaties that we solemnly belong to, like the Geneva Convention.
[01:24:32.919 --> 01:24:45.944]  Second, I wouldn't put it past him, Alex, that he wants to create something worse than the Tompkins-Gault facade, that he would really want to create some kind of warlike
[01:24:46.477 --> 01:24:55.022]  A move against Iran in order to heighten the public and shut down dissent and win the election for the Republican Party.
[01:24:56.083 --> 01:24:57.263]  So you think that's a real danger?
[01:24:57.464 --> 01:24:58.724]  I think it's very much a real danger.
[01:24:59.185 --> 01:25:14.974]  Should there be a congressional investigation immediately started or do you have any other ideas of ways to draw attention to the fact that Cy Hirst, the most respected investigative journalist living right now, except maybe yourself, you've worn so many hats, would come out and say this and only Keith Olbermann covered it?
[01:25:16.149 --> 01:25:22.933]  The people in the Pentagon, Alex, are worried about Dick Cheney and the neoconservatives, and the drumbeat against Iran.
[01:25:23.653 --> 01:25:31.638]  And the drumbeat against Iran could get this country in a huge amount of trouble, because it's bigger than Iraq.
[01:25:32.118 --> 01:25:34.840]  The Straits of Hormuz could be blocked, because that could do it.
[01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:35.741]  Oil prices.
[01:25:35.901 --> 01:25:37.642]  Oil, and the prices.
[01:25:38.102 --> 01:25:40.804]  Gasolines, heating oil, and the economies of the world.
[01:25:41.224 --> 01:25:44.746]  So, I think the Democrats should make a declaration and say,
[01:25:45.450 --> 01:25:59.282]  If Bush J makes a military move, make a military move against Iran, without consulting and being cleared with Congress, under constitutional provision, they will move immediately to impeach him, both of them in the House, and convict them in the Senate.
[01:25:59.563 --> 01:26:00.624]  And you would do that as President?
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:02.481]  Absolutely.
[01:26:02.561 --> 01:26:11.765]  In fact, the criminal laws apply to presidents and vice presidents when they leave office, just as they applied to Nixon on Watergate before Ford pardoned him.
[01:26:12.185 --> 01:26:14.707]  And so... Bush has declared these new powers that never existed.
[01:26:14.947 --> 01:26:18.669]  In closing, tell us about the campaign websites and the big rally that's coming up tonight, sir.
[01:26:18.949 --> 01:26:25.852]  In our email list, whether you vote for us or not, Nader Gonzalez, the website is VoteNader.org, that's VoteNader.org.
[01:26:26.313 --> 01:26:31.035]  The super rally is at University of Denver, the Magnus Auditorium.
[01:26:31.579 --> 01:26:31.939]  I don't know.
[01:26:45.373 --> 01:26:50.438]  Folks, you can buy tickets at Denver Nader HQ, 1155 Sherman Street.
[01:26:50.538 --> 01:26:51.058]  The number is 303.
[01:26:51.519 --> 01:26:55.202]  This is for listeners to listen to us on 1360 The Lion.
[01:26:56.023 --> 01:26:57.785]  You can go to 1155 Sherman Street, 303-832-2509.
[01:27:02.614 --> 01:27:07.216]  And again, that is in Denver, Colorado, coming up this evening.
[01:27:07.236 --> 01:27:09.117]  It'll be an amazing event, and they've invited me.
[01:27:09.177 --> 01:27:12.258]  I'm very honored, and I'll be there covering the live event as well.
[01:27:12.498 --> 01:27:14.679]  Mr. Nader, as always, thanks for spending time with us.
[01:27:14.699 --> 01:27:15.639]  Thank you, Alex Jones.
[01:27:15.799 --> 01:27:17.300]  And for working so hard for the cause of liberty.
[01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:17.780]  Thank you.
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.541]  All right, folks, that's the end of the live feed.
[01:27:19.581 --> 01:27:20.161]  Thanks for watching.
[01:27:20.762 --> 01:27:22.223]  Thank you, Alex Jones.
[01:27:22.283 --> 01:27:26.306]  You know, you are kicking some major NWO ass.
[01:27:27.007 --> 01:27:38.355]  And like I said, folks, if you missed any of it, I mean, we just had Nader on Live in Overdrive, but if you missed any of it, it replays in about 30 seconds over at InfoWars.com.
[01:27:38.435 --> 01:27:45.261]  I want to let you know the Paul Craig Roberts interview I conducted today is a cannot-miss interview.
[01:27:45.601 --> 01:27:46.662]  I still have chills.
[01:27:47.509 --> 01:27:52.314]  So on behalf of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv, this is Jason Burmess signing off.
[01:27:52.634 --> 01:27:53.435]  I'll see you all tomorrow.
