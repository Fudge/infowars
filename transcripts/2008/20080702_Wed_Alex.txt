[00:00:13.493 --> 00:00:15.434]  It is already the second day of July 2008.
[00:00:15.494 --> 00:00:22.219]  Truth Rising comes out in a little more than 24 hours on July 4th.
[00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:24.480]  Online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:24.921 --> 00:00:26.942]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:00:28.923 --> 00:00:29.964]  Very excited about that.
[00:00:30.244 --> 00:00:31.725]  My first cinema verite film.
[00:00:32.586 --> 00:00:33.807]  Turned out better than I thought it would.
[00:00:34.027 --> 00:00:34.567]  It's excellent.
[00:00:35.168 --> 00:00:36.909]  I was coming back from Bilderberg Group.
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:50.230]  About a month ago, there in Virginia, and I was in the airport, and there were all these mindless neocon books and mainline stuff, and nothing interesting, and I saw Dark Mission, The Secret History of NASA.
[00:00:50.991 --> 00:01:01.299]  And I have a friend who was an engineer at NASA, and actually on the flight line, you know, there in Mission Control for some of the Apollo missions, and he said, running some of the RCA cameras, he said, you ought to read Dark Mission.
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.580]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:01:04.215 --> 00:01:20.140]  A few years ago, and I picked it up and I read it, and so much, everything that I had done my own separate research, or run into, or seen historically in mainline history, you know, the occult, you name it, everything Richard Hoagland was saying was accurate.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:30.943]  And then, there are a lot of areas in there that's his original research, and so, if everything you know checks out, then it really freaks you out, you say, this sounds credible.
[00:01:33.104 --> 00:01:45.692]  And really a frightening book, because having a shadow government, having an elite where they have suppressed advanced technologies, we know they have that, they've been caught many times, who knows what's really going on?
[00:01:45.712 --> 00:01:48.033]  You know, that's the bigger issue is, we can't trust them.
[00:01:48.714 --> 00:01:50.134]  And they've been caught lying so much.
[00:01:50.595 --> 00:01:58.960]  And this book gets into Alistair Crowley and all these people being involved in the founding of NASA, which is really mainline history the average person doesn't know, and JPL, and
[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.283]  The rest of it, that I couldn't put the book down, Dark Mission, New York Times Best Seller.
[00:02:04.303 --> 00:02:05.764]  I guess other people couldn't put it down either.
[00:02:06.384 --> 00:02:10.706]  And he's got a new edition of it out, and I'm telling you, this is just an amazing book.
[00:02:10.746 --> 00:02:12.167]  By the way, I'm not selling the book.
[00:02:12.307 --> 00:02:15.149]  We have a bookstore online, but I'm not selling the book.
[00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:16.850]  I'm saying you really should get the book.
[00:02:17.984 --> 00:02:22.147]  And, you know, whether it's all true or whether all of his ideas are right, I don't know.
[00:02:22.167 --> 00:02:25.869]  But, you know, he's got quite a pedigree and he's a really nice fellow, too.
[00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:34.354]  Richard C. Hoagland was science advisor to Walter Cronkite in CBS News during the Apollo program, former curator of the Hayden Planetarium and consultant to NASA.
[00:02:34.795 --> 00:02:36.676]  He is the co-originator, along with Eric
[00:02:37.356 --> 00:02:48.100]  Burgress of the British Interplanetary Society, of the Pioneer plaque, you know that gold plaque they sent out, currently carrying a message for mankind on the Pioneer 10 spacecraft.
[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:58.284]  And it goes on and on and on, all the things he's done in the Enterprise Institute, he heads up, and of course he's one of the most popular long-term guests on Coast to Coast AM.
[00:02:58.564 --> 00:03:01.965]  So we go to Richard C. Hoagland right now.
[00:03:02.305 --> 00:03:06.147]  Richard Hoagland, it is just wonderful to have you on the show with us, sir.
[00:03:06.847 --> 00:03:11.314]  Alex, thank you so much for inviting me and I must say I'm really happy to be here.
[00:03:12.315 --> 00:03:13.316]  Well, I'm happy to have you.
[00:03:13.436 --> 00:03:14.697]  Sir, you're the expert on all this.
[00:03:14.737 --> 00:03:18.600]  First, tell us a little bit about Richard Huggle, and believe it or not, some of my audience may not know who you are.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:34.252]  Your saga, your awakening, and then I want to get into the crazy, admitted, this is something you can prove, history of NASA, skip forward to the kidnappings and what would be murders and crazy women running around and the wheels coming off NASA, as you put it.
[00:03:35.412 --> 00:03:40.977]  And then we'll go back into the secret government and the masonic flags and all the really crazy stuff.
[00:03:42.042 --> 00:03:59.591]  Well, you know, you and I, and a lot of other people, have had an evolution, kind of a maturing, you know, we both grew up, I'm absolutely convinced, even though I don't know your story chapter by chapter, but I'm convinced you grew up like me, believing in, you know, truth, justice, the American way.
[00:04:00.612 --> 00:04:11.057]  And that we lived in the best country in the world, and it was founded by people that had fascinating ideas, and it was the freest, and it allowed people the widest diversity,
[00:04:12.077 --> 00:04:26.100]  And it's only as you grow older and you start asking difficult questions, and you pull up the corners of the rug and you kind of look under, that you realize that that is a very carefully kept facade.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:33.181]  That in fact, society we live in now bears no resemblance to what we were taught in school.
[00:04:33.902 --> 00:04:36.962]  And about all the silly and stupid things, yes, we're free.
[00:04:37.842 --> 00:04:40.423]  About all the important things, Alex, we're not free.
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.461]  And the thing that will make you free is to not believe what you're told.
[00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:47.022]  It's as simple as that.
[00:04:47.662 --> 00:05:08.808]  So when I started out, Squeaky Clean Mainstream, you know, Cronkite, NASA, museums, science, and all that, and I came through a series of deep, penetrating questions to the belief that not only have we been lied to by NASA about almost everything that they've told us that's out there, but we've been told lies about everything that means everything to anybody.
[00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.071]  And there's almost no limit.
[00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:17.914]  I mean, the kind of watchword, the mantra of Dark Mission is, the lie is different at every level.
[00:05:18.854 --> 00:05:26.818]  And I was given that by an intel officer, who has been one of my dark, deep sources for years and years, who has never steered me wrong.
[00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:31.640]  So you're saying, wheels within wheels, lies within lies, piled on the next one.
[00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.721]  To maintain the illusion.
[00:05:34.502 --> 00:05:37.363]  And of course, this audience is well familiar with your work.
[00:05:38.135 --> 00:05:46.101]  So we can skip all the stuff that I normally have to do to bring people up the curve, and today it might be useful to explore why.
[00:05:46.781 --> 00:05:48.142]  What the hell's the endgame?
[00:05:48.242 --> 00:05:49.063]  What's the point?
[00:05:49.863 --> 00:05:52.445]  Why lead people down the primrose path?
[00:05:52.565 --> 00:05:54.406]  Where did we go off the path?
[00:05:55.107 --> 00:05:56.888]  And how can we get back on the path?
[00:05:56.908 --> 00:06:06.575]  Because I firmly believe that we are not powerless, that we actually can change this curve, that we are masters of our own fate, captains of our destiny,
[00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.393]  But we have to wake up a lot more people.
[00:06:09.933 --> 00:06:12.696]  It really only takes about 2%, Alex, to change history.
[00:06:12.717 --> 00:06:13.838]  Well, you're right, Richard Hoagland.
[00:06:13.878 --> 00:06:16.040]  Can we go back, though, to your first awakenings?
[00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:23.009]  I mean, when did you start at NASA and at CBS and a big curator and, you know, designing what's sent off in spacecraft?
[00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.291]  You know, a big conceptual guy.
[00:06:25.351 --> 00:06:27.194]  When did you start going, something's wrong here?
[00:06:27.924 --> 00:06:30.865]  Okay, oh gosh, and how many hours have we got?
[00:06:32.505 --> 00:06:41.668]  I started out, you know, school and the museum and I was, you know, kind of a prodigy and I was the youngest curator in the United States for a while.
[00:06:41.688 --> 00:06:42.848]  Of course, I grew out of that one.
[00:06:43.708 --> 00:06:57.192]  And I, you know, when you're 18 and in a museum and the mayor is calling you in for advice on how to increase, you know, revenues in the city through cultural diversity and all that, it gives you a kind of heavy feeling you can do anything.
[00:06:57.955 --> 00:07:00.257]  So I would pick up the phone, and I would call anybody in the country.
[00:07:00.297 --> 00:07:01.357]  I'd call people at NASA.
[00:07:01.457 --> 00:07:02.698]  I'd call people in the government.
[00:07:03.298 --> 00:07:06.140]  I'd call people in the military, at the Pentagon.
[00:07:06.821 --> 00:07:10.343]  And they would answer, and they would give me answers, and they would return calls and all that.
[00:07:10.483 --> 00:07:16.747]  And I finally went to a couple of museums, and I was assistant curator in Hartford, West Harbor, Connecticut.
[00:07:17.708 --> 00:07:23.872]  And one day, I got a call, and the voice at the other end of the line said, My name is Frank Benitez.
[00:07:24.572 --> 00:07:27.394]  I'm associate producer of CBS News special events.
[00:07:28.004 --> 00:07:29.745]  We'd like you to help us go to the moon.
[00:07:30.865 --> 00:07:35.347]  And like that great line in Bill Cosby's routine, I said, come on, who is this?
[00:07:35.567 --> 00:07:35.928]  Really?
[00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:39.869]  And it turned out to be Frank Menezes from CBS News.
[00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:54.016]  And so I went and had the most extraordinary education at CBS News from 1968, just before the first Apollo 8 mission around the moon, to the early 1970s.
[00:07:54.036 --> 00:07:54.316]  71, I believe.
[00:07:57.877 --> 00:08:04.761]  Um, and I'm sure I learned far more than I imparted, because I saw how big media works.
[00:08:05.521 --> 00:08:15.466]  I saw how the Tiffany Network, you know, the legendary, you know, legacy of Murrow, actually worked in its heyday.
[00:08:16.269 --> 00:08:20.830]  When Walter came back from Vietnam, looked into the camera and said, it's lost.
[00:08:21.491 --> 00:08:26.052]  And, you know, Nixon and Agnew said to each other, well, we lost him.
[00:08:26.272 --> 00:08:27.332]  You know, the war has to end.
[00:08:27.712 --> 00:08:29.293]  If we lost Walter, we lost the country.
[00:08:30.233 --> 00:08:38.676]  I was so privileged to work with a man of integrity, a guy who actually believed the things that he was writing about and reporting on.
[00:08:39.016 --> 00:08:42.397]  Remember when Walter was the one dissident voice during the first Gulf War?
[00:08:46.337 --> 00:08:53.720]  How he was, he was a voice of reason saying all we're seeing is basically a scripted television plot.
[00:08:54.421 --> 00:09:01.424]  We're not allowed, you know, remember the, that was before they came up with the idea of embedding reporters so that they basically could watch them 24-7.
[00:09:03.272 --> 00:09:09.557]  Um, and there were a couple of guys that struck out across the desert and tried to find independent information and got caught by Saddam and all that.
[00:09:09.597 --> 00:09:18.603]  Well, Walter was one of the only voices that basically raised questions about this rah-rah, we're gonna go beat this bad guy, you know, the new Neo-Hitler.
[00:09:19.624 --> 00:09:23.927]  Um, anyway, so back when I was working for him, I learned about sourcing.
[00:09:24.867 --> 00:09:27.149]  And, you know, I learned the journalism side.
[00:09:27.209 --> 00:09:29.931]  I knew the science side, but I really learned journalism.
[00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:35.275]  At the feet of a guy who really was a master.
[00:09:36.116 --> 00:09:39.480]  And I started looking around and I remember one vivid day.
[00:09:39.801 --> 00:09:46.449]  You want to know the moment, Alex, when I began to realize that the facade was not what it was supposed to be?
[00:09:46.469 --> 00:09:48.271]  Yeah, tell me that light bulb moment.
[00:09:49.091 --> 00:09:50.612]  It was very early on.
[00:09:50.973 --> 00:10:05.604]  It was critical, and if I hadn't been asked by the Cronkite people to be there and help them create this extravaganza to show people what it was like to go to the moon, I wouldn't have had a helicopter lightbulb moment or it would have come a lot later.
[00:10:06.444 --> 00:10:08.726]  It was on a Sunday afternoon.
[00:10:09.587 --> 00:10:12.589]  There were a bunch of us sitting around in Bob Westler's office.
[00:10:12.649 --> 00:10:15.451]  Bob Westler was the executive producer of CBS Special Events.
[00:10:15.992 --> 00:10:18.554]  He went on to become president of CBS News.
[00:10:19.133 --> 00:10:19.653]  For a while.
[00:10:20.114 --> 00:10:22.555]  Then he went and helped Ted Turner set up his network.
[00:10:23.615 --> 00:10:25.637]  Um, which was called CNN.
[00:10:26.477 --> 00:10:29.218]  Anyway, Walter was a child prodigy.
[00:10:29.238 --> 00:10:34.421]  He was a brilliant guy, very egocentric, very... I mean, in order to be in that position, you gotta be, right?
[00:10:35.302 --> 00:10:46.848]  Um, and we were sitting around in his office, you know, he had the cabinet open, and there was some, you know, liquor flowing around, and we were just kind of watching the news conference that was supposed to be coming in from Houston.
[00:10:48.421 --> 00:10:49.282]  Uh, by satellite.
[00:10:50.043 --> 00:10:51.184]  Uh, from the astronauts.
[00:10:51.444 --> 00:10:55.428]  I forget which crew was coming back, um, from the moon.
[00:10:56.029 --> 00:10:56.889]  I think it was Apollo 8.
[00:10:57.370 --> 00:10:58.111]  It had to be Apollo 8.
[00:10:58.351 --> 00:11:00.353]  So it was December of 1968.
[00:11:01.794 --> 00:11:11.384]  And we're sitting around and there's, you know, a couple of producers and a researcher and me and Lester and, you know, some people coupling papers and bringing in stuff from the rest of the office.
[00:11:12.031 --> 00:11:18.694]  And we're just kind of, you know, we're kind of laid back because our correspondent there in Houston was going to ask the questions during the uplink.
[00:11:18.714 --> 00:11:24.917]  This is the first time they were going to actually allow correspondents to talk to astronauts directly.
[00:11:25.057 --> 00:11:30.500]  Okay, I want to hear about this on the other side of the break with Richard C. Hoagland.
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:35.783]  We're going to skip the break after that for behind the scenes at presentplanet.tv.
[00:11:35.823 --> 00:11:37.743]  We'll be back in just a few minutes with Richard C. Hoagland.
[00:11:37.764 --> 00:11:40.465]  Then we're going to get into the beginning of NASA.
[00:11:41.658 --> 00:11:49.828]  The three groups that made up the founding of NASA, which is a creature of the president, a creature of the executive branch.
[00:11:54.458 --> 00:11:55.519]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:11:55.899 --> 00:12:01.381]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:12:01.962 --> 00:12:02.462]  That's right.
[00:12:02.782 --> 00:12:05.063]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:12:05.624 --> 00:12:12.547]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:12:13.107 --> 00:12:20.799]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:26.047]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:12:26.704 --> 00:12:31.727]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:12:32.527 --> 00:12:36.650]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:37.310]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:39.231]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:12:39.311 --> 00:12:39.611]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:12:39.911 --> 00:12:40.172]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:12:52.759 --> 00:12:58.222]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:12:58.482 --> 00:12:59.803]  And we knew what to do.
[00:12:59.823 --> 00:13:01.564]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:13:01.804 --> 00:13:08.227]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:13:08.847 --> 00:13:15.551]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.400]  We're safe to breathe.
[00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:24.543]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:13:24.823 --> 00:13:27.904]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:13:28.004 --> 00:13:33.245]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:13:33.765 --> 00:13:36.446]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:13:36.846 --> 00:13:42.688]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[00:13:42.888 --> 00:13:45.329]  Or order the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:13:45.809 --> 00:13:50.834]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:13:52.115 --> 00:13:55.178]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[00:13:55.538 --> 00:13:57.600]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.863]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[00:14:01.163 --> 00:14:10.152]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston, online, from my desk, with WebEx.
[00:14:10.652 --> 00:14:13.714]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[00:14:13.934 --> 00:14:18.576]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[00:14:18.716 --> 00:14:22.418]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[00:14:22.658 --> 00:14:24.179]  Travel less, meet online.
[00:14:24.279 --> 00:14:26.760]  Go to Webex.com and try Webex free.
[00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.262]  Just click the radiographic and enter promo code 500.
[00:14:30.302 --> 00:14:31.742]  Hey, Bonnie, no more pickpocketing for us.
[00:14:31.842 --> 00:14:37.084]  I have an easier way we can steal people's credit cards without them even knowing they've been robbed.
[00:14:37.304 --> 00:14:37.664]  How so, Clyde?
[00:14:59.949 --> 00:15:02.711]  I have this RFID reader I picked up on the internet.
[00:15:02.891 --> 00:15:07.554]  Just by waving it near you, I can skim your credit card information while your cards are still in your purse.
[00:15:07.754 --> 00:15:08.295]  Just watch.
[00:15:08.895 --> 00:15:10.836]  Hey look, that's my info on the screen.
[00:15:10.976 --> 00:15:12.237]  You gotta be kidding me!
[00:15:12.477 --> 00:15:12.718]  Nope.
[00:15:12.858 --> 00:15:16.900]  With 50 million credit cards with hidden RFID chips, I figure we'll make a fortune.
[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.322]  As long as people don't hear about Identity Stronghold.
[00:15:19.562 --> 00:15:19.902]  Why?
[00:15:20.103 --> 00:15:21.864]  What's Identity Stronghold?
[00:15:22.064 --> 00:15:23.385]  They make the Secure Sleeve.
[00:15:23.606 --> 00:15:27.169]  When people keep their credit cards in the shielded Secure Sleeve, I can't read them.
[00:15:27.209 --> 00:15:30.172]  Do a lot of people already know about the Secure Sleeve?
[00:15:30.292 --> 00:15:30.932]  No way.
[00:15:31.152 --> 00:15:34.535]  Most people don't realize they even have chips in their credit cards and passports.
[00:15:34.716 --> 00:15:37.318]  Clyde, we should get some of those Secure Sleeves.
[00:15:37.438 --> 00:15:38.359]  I already got some.
[00:15:38.559 --> 00:15:40.221]  I also got some to fit our passports.
[00:15:40.461 --> 00:15:45.105]  Identity Stronghold has Secure Sleeves for sale right on the internet at idstronghold.com.
[00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:47.067]  IDStronghold.com?
[00:15:47.268 --> 00:15:47.608]  Right!
[00:15:47.768 --> 00:15:48.749]  Or you can call them at 1-800-610-2770.
[00:16:17.458 --> 00:16:18.438]  Dark Majesty.
[00:16:18.458 --> 00:16:25.961]  It's Tex Marr's book, getting into the whole secret government available at Infowars.com.
[00:16:27.581 --> 00:16:35.183]  And a book that gets even more in-depth into NASA and how this whole empire hooks together is Dark Mission, The Secret History of NASA.
[00:16:35.203 --> 00:16:43.146]  Richard C. Hoagland, who was a consultant to NASA, curator of a major museum, designed some of the things that were sent out on deep space aircraft.
[00:16:44.026 --> 00:16:51.288]  You came up with the conceptual ideas for it, and of course working with Walter Cronkite there at CBS News is our guest.
[00:16:51.948 --> 00:17:02.251]  We've gotten to the point where you're sitting in there, the first time your correspondent is going to be allowed, or correspondent period, to talk to the astronauts when they're on the moon.
[00:17:02.591 --> 00:17:02.971]  Go ahead.
[00:17:03.731 --> 00:17:07.572]  Yeah, I think you meant deep space spacecraft, not aircraft, right?
[00:17:07.712 --> 00:17:08.012]  Yes.
[00:17:08.552 --> 00:17:09.813]  No, deep space aircraft.
[00:17:09.833 --> 00:17:11.093]  Deep space hot air balloons.
[00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:19.297]  Anyway, so we're sitting around in the executive producer's suite, because he had a big office in the suite, and we're just kicking back.
[00:17:19.337 --> 00:17:21.680]  It's on a Sunday afternoon, and we're watching our guy.
[00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:26.125]  Remember, NASA used to jealously guard any access to the astronauts.
[00:17:27.143 --> 00:17:32.868]  During the Mercury program, they have what they call a capsule communicator, the Capcom, who is usually another astronaut.
[00:17:33.368 --> 00:17:44.696]  And even the flight directors or the head of NASA normally would go through the Capcom to talk to the crews in orbit, as opposed to picking up the phone or picking up the mic and talking to the director.
[00:17:45.077 --> 00:17:47.459]  So this was a real break with this tradition.
[00:17:47.979 --> 00:17:49.160]  It was the first time
[00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:58.514]  That ordinary reporters were going to be allowed to ask questions directly of a NASA crew in space during a live mission.
[00:17:58.934 --> 00:18:02.615]  So it was a big deal for the network, and it was a big deal for our unit and all that.
[00:18:02.635 --> 00:18:05.236]  So we're sitting there watching to see how it was going to play out.
[00:18:05.897 --> 00:18:16.761]  And NASA comes on and says, you know, I think it was Paul Haney in those days, well, we're having a small delay, you know, the press conference will be in 15 minutes or something like that.
[00:18:17.541 --> 00:18:18.842]  So we had another round, right?
[00:18:19.805 --> 00:18:21.166]  And then it comes on again.
[00:18:21.226 --> 00:18:24.830]  Well, the press conferences, you know, we're having a small technical problem.
[00:18:26.171 --> 00:18:33.077]  The spacecraft has not yet risen over the horizon at Goldstone.
[00:18:33.117 --> 00:18:34.818]  Goldstone was on the big tracking station.
[00:18:35.459 --> 00:18:37.641]  So we have to wait for acquisition of signal.
[00:18:38.601 --> 00:18:41.484]  Something about that kind of bothered me.
[00:18:42.395 --> 00:18:52.381]  So I literally, Alex, I literally took a... I was sitting in a chair by Wester's desk, so I took the back of an envelope on his desk and I started to do some scribbling, some calculation.
[00:18:53.822 --> 00:18:56.243]  And I looked at my numbers and I thought, this is nuts.
[00:18:57.184 --> 00:19:02.087]  And I shoved the paper over to Wester and I said, Bob, I said, NASA's lying.
[00:19:03.688 --> 00:19:09.091]  If that's true, if what they're saying is true, those damn mountains have to be five miles high.
[00:19:10.352 --> 00:19:10.872]  And they're not.
[00:19:12.233 --> 00:19:14.975]  And that was the first time two things hit.
[00:19:15.515 --> 00:19:24.240]  One was that this agency that I believe was the agency, was for some stupid reason not telling us the truth, couldn't figure out what the agenda was.
[00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:31.544]  And then the reaction from my own, you know, guy, who had hired me, was, oh come on, you gotta be wrong.
[00:19:31.784 --> 00:19:32.685]  NASA would not lie.
[00:19:33.845 --> 00:19:36.927]  And this had persisted down to the present.
[00:19:36.967 --> 00:19:38.068]  The mainstream media
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.902]  Even when this agency has killed people.
[00:19:42.623 --> 00:19:53.069]  I'm talking Challenger, I'm talking Columbia, I'm talking bizarreness like the Lisa Nowak case, which makes no sense at all, unless you start asking deeper questions.
[00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:59.834]  NASA is a we-can-do-no-wrong agency even when they're blatantly, flagrantly doing wrong.
[00:20:00.908 --> 00:20:15.619]  And that to me has been a mystery that still fascinates me because it's like with so much demonstrable, not only just error, but deliberate malfeasance, deliberate, you know, skullduggery, deliberate lying.
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:23.125]  Why does this agency maintain this pristine example of the, you know, as Reagan used to say, the shining city on the hill?
[00:20:24.193 --> 00:20:40.635]  And that's another question that I don't have a good answer for, but I want a lot of people to think about it, because unless we crack the facade, I mean, there are other institutions in this society where no matter what you lay out, people will not believe that your data is right, and the institutional
[00:20:41.315 --> 00:20:45.318]  facade or persona or manufactured image is wrong?
[00:20:45.339 --> 00:20:46.199]  Well, here's an example.
[00:20:46.239 --> 00:21:07.517]  That happened first... I mean, a good example is, at first they would bust high-level Catholic priests, cardinals, fathers, monsignors, raping children, and for decades the police wouldn't even investigate or prosecute because you don't go after a cardinal, you don't go after a bishop, you don't go after a bigwig,
[00:21:08.317 --> 00:21:09.959]  I mean, that's impossible.
[00:21:10.019 --> 00:21:10.680]  It can't be true.
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:16.388]  And now we know about a third of them, it turned out, were involved or involved in the cover-up.
[00:21:16.708 --> 00:21:18.190]  I mean, is that a good analogy?
[00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:19.472]  It's an excellent analogy.
[00:21:19.512 --> 00:21:21.314]  In fact, I was kind of in the back of my mind.
[00:21:21.334 --> 00:21:24.799]  That being a Reformed Catholic, that was kind of what was on my mind.
[00:21:25.259 --> 00:21:25.499]  Wow.
[00:21:25.919 --> 00:21:26.800]  Okay, we'll stay there.
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:29.981]  We're going to talk behind the scenes about some of the things you want to bring up.
[00:21:30.001 --> 00:21:34.783]  When we get back, the basic history of NASA, all verifiable, but still just amazing.
[00:21:34.803 --> 00:21:36.104]  Then we'll get into mind control.
[00:21:36.704 --> 00:21:40.406]  Are they covering up artifacts on the Moon and Mars?
[00:21:40.466 --> 00:21:41.066]  A lot more.
[00:21:42.807 --> 00:21:43.687]  We're on the march.
[00:21:44.188 --> 00:21:45.788]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:46.729 --> 00:21:49.410]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:52.947 --> 00:21:53.828]  Hello, I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz.
[00:21:53.908 --> 00:21:55.769]  I'm going to go ahead and talk to him behind the scenes.
[00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:58.051]  Mr. Hoagland?
[00:21:58.671 --> 00:21:59.011]  Yes, sir.
[00:21:59.492 --> 00:22:00.812]  I think the interview is going great.
[00:22:00.832 --> 00:22:06.096]  For folks that are watching out there, I want to keep the discussion congruent so we'll come back to the history of NASA when we return.
[00:22:06.116 --> 00:22:10.379]  But in the two and a half minutes, we've got to tell stories.
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:20.184]  So you start questioning NASA at that point, you start saying, we're being lied to, there's no way the radio signals couldn't get over mountains unless they were five miles tall.
[00:22:20.404 --> 00:22:24.386]  Well, remember, you're on a rotating planet, so things rise and set.
[00:22:24.466 --> 00:22:33.811]  So they were waiting for the spacecraft literally to rise over the horizon at Goldstone, which is located west of Los Angeles, out in the desert there, at a place called Barstow, California.
[00:22:34.572 --> 00:22:39.254]  And my calculation proved, unequivocally, that the spacecraft had already risen.
[00:22:40.017 --> 00:22:41.858]  You know, because we had charts and maps.
[00:22:41.918 --> 00:22:43.978]  I mean, maps used to give us incredible information.
[00:22:44.018 --> 00:22:44.659]  No, I understand.
[00:22:44.959 --> 00:22:48.760]  So then you start questioning, what was the next lie you caught him in?
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:50.221]  Oh, God.
[00:22:50.241 --> 00:22:52.121]  I mean, now you're looking for lies.
[00:22:52.361 --> 00:22:53.862]  What was the next big one you remembered?
[00:22:54.082 --> 00:23:05.706]  No, this was one of those, it's kind of like, if you have an impenetrable shield and something cracks the shield, from then on you start asking, why are they saying this?
[00:23:06.826 --> 00:23:08.047]  It only takes one
[00:23:08.817 --> 00:23:09.297]  Event.
[00:23:09.797 --> 00:23:12.299]  You know, swan swallow to make a summary, as the cliche goes.
[00:23:12.859 --> 00:23:16.320]  And it was at that point that I realized that NASA would lie.
[00:23:17.401 --> 00:23:38.170]  And it turned out later that the reason for the lie, this is what's the kicker, was so incredibly stupid and trivial, it turned out that Jules Bergman, who was one of the correspondents, the lead correspondent, we had Cronkite, we had Hartley and Brinkley over at CBS,
[00:23:39.094 --> 00:23:43.578]  Uh, and then we had, uh, what's his name, uh, Jules Bergman at ABC.
[00:23:43.598 --> 00:23:45.339]  There were only three networks in those days.
[00:23:46.059 --> 00:23:47.781]  Bergman wanted to be an astronaut.
[00:23:47.821 --> 00:23:48.581]  He did all the stuff.
[00:23:48.601 --> 00:23:57.688]  He went through the, you know, the chill tanks and the whirly gigs and all the training that the astronauts had gone through to prove that, you know, it was basically the right stuff.
[00:23:58.248 --> 00:24:00.170]  You know, his testosterone level was pretty high.
[00:24:00.882 --> 00:24:01.843]  Actually, I knew him.
[00:24:01.903 --> 00:24:03.104]  He was a pretty great guy.
[00:24:03.164 --> 00:24:07.828]  He actually asked me for some information when I was pool correspondent.
[00:24:07.868 --> 00:24:09.009]  Sure, but what was the reason?
[00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:11.572]  Well, the reason was Jules Bergman.
[00:24:12.232 --> 00:24:14.835]  He had drunk too much the night before.
[00:24:15.535 --> 00:24:17.677]  And he was hungover in his motel room.
[00:24:18.418 --> 00:24:20.580]  And he got to the Space Center late.
[00:24:21.481 --> 00:24:27.006]  And all of NASA was holding this press conference to cover for Bergman being
[00:24:27.887 --> 00:24:28.988]  Basically hungover.
[00:24:29.048 --> 00:24:33.411]  And that's how a lying culture starts, though, is you lie for little reasons.
[00:24:33.471 --> 00:24:38.936]  Instead of saying, we're late with the press conference, they tell a lie, and then you start investigating and find bigger ones.
[00:24:39.436 --> 00:24:46.021]  Well, the thing was here, they were lying to protect one of their own, which was a double communication.
[00:24:46.221 --> 00:24:47.242]  Sure, here we go.
[00:24:47.562 --> 00:24:51.145]  We're going back live on the main show right now with Richard C. Hoagland.
[00:24:51.165 --> 00:24:51.706]  Here we go, Richard.
[00:24:58.647 --> 00:25:01.208]  Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive.
[00:25:01.228 --> 00:25:03.548]  He stood six foot six and weighed 245.
[00:25:03.648 --> 00:25:07.709]  Kind of broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip.
[00:25:07.749 --> 00:25:11.771]  The book is a New York Times bestseller, Dark Mission, The Secret History of NASA.
[00:25:12.051 --> 00:25:18.472]  For folks watching at PrisonPlanet.tv, you can see the cover of the book with the Grand Masonic flag on it there.
[00:25:18.532 --> 00:25:20.373]  We're going to talk about that later.
[00:25:20.393 --> 00:25:24.074]  You can get the book at bookstores everywhere or
[00:25:26.928 --> 00:25:34.033]  Mr. Hoagland, what's the best site to visit to get your booker to learn more about the huge overarching things that you're doing?
[00:25:34.994 --> 00:25:36.075]  Darkmission.net.
[00:25:36.135 --> 00:25:37.456]  We've set up a website for the book.
[00:25:38.342 --> 00:25:40.644]  But then you also have the Enterprise group.
[00:25:40.744 --> 00:25:45.527]  I have the Enterprise Mission, yes, but that's basically a huge panoply of everything.
[00:25:45.947 --> 00:25:55.254]  If you're focused on the book and how to get it and the discussions going on, Mike Barra, my co-author, has a blog over there, and we publish new events around the book.
[00:25:55.634 --> 00:25:57.276]  Darkmission.net is the place to go.
[00:25:57.476 --> 00:26:00.058]  Darkmission.net, but go ahead and plug your other sites while we're at it.
[00:26:00.698 --> 00:26:01.679]  Enterprisemission.com.
[00:26:02.862 --> 00:26:10.064]  Everything you ever wanted to know about the space program that you were afraid to ask, or didn't know who to ask, is at EnterpriseMission.com.
[00:26:11.084 --> 00:26:14.525]  Well, let's start getting into the history of NASA.
[00:26:14.545 --> 00:26:25.727]  You've got connections to L. Ron Hubbard, Alistair Crowley, Nazis, occultists, I mean, and then we see all the occultism in their symbols, their names.
[00:26:26.608 --> 00:26:27.808]  Break that down for us, Richard.
[00:26:28.877 --> 00:26:53.696]  Well, once you start asking questions, you know, one question leads to another, leads to another, leads to another, and when I realized that NASA had covered up this momentous press conference event, basically stalled it for half an hour to cover for a hungover correspondent for ABC News, I then realized that this agency, which was supposed to be exploring space for the benefit of all mankind,
[00:26:54.554 --> 00:27:02.478]  ...was basically not above doing anything lying to protect one individual, or in this case, probably to Curry's favor.
[00:27:02.979 --> 00:27:10.403]  Because if Bergman, who was going to ask the question for ABC, had not been there when this historic thing happened, there would have been a holy hell today.
[00:27:11.083 --> 00:27:17.487]  And NASA was obviously, in retrospect, skewing its entire public affairs program
[00:27:18.089 --> 00:27:24.552]  For this correspondent so that he would give them favorable coverage in future missions, in future years.
[00:27:24.572 --> 00:27:27.373]  I understand, but it shows a culture of back-scratching and lying.
[00:27:27.393 --> 00:27:28.093]  Let's go back.
[00:27:30.374 --> 00:27:34.196]  That gets into how are these missions covered.
[00:27:35.116 --> 00:27:40.158]  You know, we think of the Fourth Estate, Alex, as the kind of fourth part of government.
[00:27:40.658 --> 00:27:44.700]  You have the three branches, then you have the press, which is supposed to be the watchdog group.
[00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:53.158]  You know that press people rate somewhere down around Congress and lawyers in terms of public opinion, public perception?
[00:27:53.198 --> 00:28:04.569]  Yes, I do, because they just sit there in little sequestered rooms drinking coffee as they're given press releases, and they're kept creatures, more and more domesticated creatures, by the government, and you have the President
[00:28:05.743 --> 00:28:08.464]  Well, the key thing, of course, goes back to World War II.
[00:28:08.544 --> 00:28:11.805]  You know, we had this huge war between us and the bad guys, the Nazis.
[00:28:33.466 --> 00:28:55.164]  Um, or the, you know, the fascists, and it involved, you know, the world involved, Japan involved, you know, Mussolini involved, Hitler involved, huge armies and millions of deaths and billions of dollars, and it was basically, you know, if you look at it archetypally, it was the forces of dark against the forces of light.
[00:28:56.025 --> 00:29:02.090]  Well, one of the things you've got to realize is the forces of light were operating on the same wavelength as the forces of darkness.
[00:29:03.033 --> 00:29:04.914]  FDR was a 33rd degree mason.
[00:29:05.695 --> 00:29:18.842]  And I started realizing that history itself, mainstream history, not just NASA, but mainstream history with the help of one of my friends, Ron Nix, who's a geologist, but also has done a tremendous amount of work in this area.
[00:29:20.155 --> 00:29:36.518]  ...appears to be manipulating the conventional calendar, conventional historical events, according to occult and astrological signs and times and dates and moments of eventuality.
[00:29:36.598 --> 00:29:43.624]  And an everyday example of that would be Ronald Reagan, to the minute, when he gave a speech, what day, what he was wearing.
[00:29:43.924 --> 00:29:46.106]  Now, of course, Hitler designed it all.
[00:29:46.526 --> 00:29:50.249]  The modern Olympics, they're going to have it on 888 at 888 in the morning.
[00:29:50.269 --> 00:29:53.452]  I mean, they are really into numbers, numerology.
[00:29:53.492 --> 00:29:54.212]  Please continue.
[00:29:55.173 --> 00:30:00.978]  Well, as I was investigating, you know, as I went through the rest of my career with NASA and the networks,
[00:30:01.849 --> 00:30:09.192]  Given that big lie on that Sunday morning, I started looking at how the press dealt with NASA, and I noticed a favoritism.
[00:30:10.114 --> 00:30:11.735]  You know, certain people were curried.
[00:30:11.775 --> 00:30:13.376]  Certain people were given favors.
[00:30:13.396 --> 00:30:15.117]  Certain people were given special things.
[00:30:15.597 --> 00:30:17.038]  Other people were kind of excluded.
[00:30:17.598 --> 00:30:19.319]  You know, there was a pecking order.
[00:30:19.559 --> 00:30:32.126]  And those that were given favor were always writing favorable stories, or doing favorable coverage, or favorable pieces on the network, be it ABC, NBC, or CBS.
[00:30:33.027 --> 00:30:35.768]  So I realize there was this incestuous relationship.
[00:30:35.808 --> 00:30:36.649]  So years later,
[00:30:37.364 --> 00:30:44.858]  When I began to ask the questions about fundamental things, like why did we land on the moon on July 20th, 1969?
[00:30:47.452 --> 00:30:55.518]  And the answer was, and you could actually do this with a computer, which was accessible then, was not accessible during my, you know, surgery with NASA.
[00:30:55.638 --> 00:31:02.584]  We didn't have personal computers, we didn't have laptops, we didn't have, you know, Macs, we didn't have anything that gives us, certainly didn't have the internet.
[00:31:03.004 --> 00:31:11.871]  The tools to combat this, you know, lies different at every level problem we're dealing with now, we basically were on our own with going to libraries.
[00:31:12.694 --> 00:31:21.740]  So, I started, when we got the Internet, we got the computers, I started looking at launch dates and landing times, and I noticed this bizarre pattern.
[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:35.648]  This was in the mid-90s, which was that there appeared to be some kind of astrological, calendrical timekeeping behind the most important and major events in NASA's history.
[00:31:36.488 --> 00:31:42.332]  And more than that, certain key events, like landings on the Moon with unmanned spacecraft,
[00:31:43.098 --> 00:31:50.244]  And then later with manned spacecraft, the Apollo program actually were skewed to land on Hitler's birthday.
[00:31:51.205 --> 00:31:52.846]  And another light bulb went off.
[00:31:53.046 --> 00:31:53.486]  Bing!
[00:31:54.287 --> 00:32:11.361]  Because everybody knows, you know, it's almost, almost on school, that NASA was formed of the nucleus of the German scientist in Operation Paperclip, including the big one, the superstar, Wernher von Braun, brought over to the United States
[00:32:11.929 --> 00:32:16.975]  You know, as our pet Nazis after World War II, after we quote, won World War II.
[00:32:17.716 --> 00:32:26.727]  Well, bottom line, in Dark Mission, Mike and I lay out the case that the pet Nazis basically rose up and ate NASA for lunch.
[00:32:27.648 --> 00:32:29.550]  And everything that NASA's been doing.
[00:32:30.347 --> 00:32:37.753]  has been on some kind of bizarre Nazi ritual Thule, you know, Thule Society calendar.
[00:32:37.953 --> 00:32:45.780]  But you talk about, and then even the maps, the official ball caps, the patches, you know, then fit into all this.
[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:51.745]  There's symbology, the patches are designed to reflect these philosophies.
[00:32:52.005 --> 00:32:54.347]  Now what was interesting is you had three groups.
[00:32:55.003 --> 00:32:55.883]  We've discovered.
[00:32:55.903 --> 00:32:56.463]  That's the key.
[00:32:56.483 --> 00:32:58.044]  You've got this Alistair Crowley group.
[00:32:58.084 --> 00:33:00.444]  I mean, this is, this is, this is, this is admitted, folks.
[00:33:00.484 --> 00:33:00.964]  Go through it.
[00:33:01.724 --> 00:33:07.506]  You have three groups that ultimately were vying for power in the creation of NASA when Eisenhower did it in 1958.
[00:33:08.706 --> 00:33:13.527]  You had the Nazis, who of course were the big, you know, 800-pound gorilla.
[00:33:14.167 --> 00:33:15.227]  You had the Masons.
[00:33:16.047 --> 00:33:23.589]  I mean, the Masons are kind of the good guys in this scenario, because James Webb, who was a 33rd degree Mason,
[00:33:24.201 --> 00:33:35.810]  Basically, he tried to set up NASA to do amazingly important things to uplift education, to uplift technology, to uplift blacks in the South.
[00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:49.400]  I mean, there's a huge swath of democratization that goes on in the United States by means of web using NASA and NASA as a tool to help Kennedy, you know, create a social renaissance.
[00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:50.090]  Thank you.
[00:34:06.781 --> 00:34:12.425]  Which is the Crowley Group, which was based out of JPL, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
[00:34:12.725 --> 00:34:17.429]  How many times have you heard, over the last 30-40 years, Alex, news stories?
[00:34:17.589 --> 00:34:24.394]  JPL, the laboratory in Pasadena, California, which is a laboratory basically under Caltech.
[00:34:25.034 --> 00:34:30.298]  So you had these three power bases, the Nazis, the Masons, and the Magicians.
[00:34:30.839 --> 00:34:33.921]  And Dark Mission goes through how they abide for power,
[00:34:34.574 --> 00:34:36.915]  For each of their overlapping reasons.
[00:34:37.835 --> 00:34:52.538]  And how the program, the space program that we all have seen, is the result of the inside feudal wars between these three groups inside NASA who only have agreed on one thing, Alex.
[00:34:53.278 --> 00:34:56.579]  And that is that we should not ever get to see what's really out there.
[00:34:56.819 --> 00:34:57.319]  Exactly!
[00:34:58.759 --> 00:35:00.982]  And Richard C. Hoogland, that's the nature of the New World Order.
[00:35:01.222 --> 00:35:15.917]  You're looking at one big pyramid, and as you know, when you pull back, it's hundreds of big pyramids that come together in that compartmentalization, and that's all it is, is these sun cults, snake cults, devil cults, sex cults,
[00:35:16.557 --> 00:35:19.560]  They run every major agency, and there are wars.
[00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:28.567]  They fight amongst themselves, but they always keep the dumb cattle in the dark, and they're all into the occult, and that's why at certain levels they get along.
[00:35:28.947 --> 00:35:29.988]  They recruit each other.
[00:35:30.008 --> 00:35:34.572]  The super-globalists you'll find will be a member of dozens of these groups.
[00:35:35.352 --> 00:35:36.413]  That is your Illuminati.
[00:35:36.433 --> 00:35:37.975]  It's the Babylon mystery religions.
[00:35:38.695 --> 00:35:39.795]  Your book has the evidence.
[00:35:39.815 --> 00:35:46.837]  Again, separately in my own research, folks, I've seen, as I can tell you, it's accurate, the parts that we're getting into now.
[00:35:47.177 --> 00:35:51.058]  I'm not saying the other stuff isn't accurate, I just am not knowledgeable about some of the stuff in the book.
[00:35:51.538 --> 00:35:53.199]  Let's talk about the magicians first.
[00:35:53.219 --> 00:36:04.881]  I mean, you've got chapter after chapter on it, but that's the part that most people, they know about the Masons, they know about the Nazis, and again, all following basically the same esoteric stuff, but a little bit different.
[00:36:05.302 --> 00:36:06.622]  Let's talk about the magicians.
[00:36:07.984 --> 00:36:24.638]  Well, the magicians go back, you know, this is my name for what's in NASA, this group, go back to Aleister Crowley, who was, you know, the self-proclaimed, you know, the beast, 666, et cetera, et cetera, the vilest man in the world, all that.
[00:36:25.839 --> 00:36:31.764]  He was trying to practice literal magic in the 20th, 19th and 20th centuries.
[00:36:33.889 --> 00:36:46.918]  Using mind over matter, using rituals, using esoteric rites, using, you know, sex magic, using anything he could get his hands on to basically try to change the world around him, to bend it to his will.
[00:36:47.439 --> 00:36:48.800]  He was one of those super guys.
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:51.742]  He was in or the head of a whole bunch of groups.
[00:36:52.322 --> 00:36:54.363]  Well, he was in and out of a lot of different groups.
[00:36:54.403 --> 00:36:56.825]  He stole freely, mixed it all together.
[00:36:56.865 --> 00:37:02.169]  There's even now a new book out which claims that he was part of the British intelligence community.
[00:37:02.836 --> 00:37:05.437]  Fighting both in World War I and World War II.
[00:37:06.797 --> 00:37:15.320]  Be that as it may, he found a young neophyte in California named Jack Parsons, who was a genius.
[00:37:15.761 --> 00:37:22.603]  He was an experimenter back in the 20s and 30s, when every kid wanted to build rockets and blow things up.
[00:37:23.343 --> 00:37:31.046]  And Jack eventually went on to help create, with a guy named Molinas, and a guy named Von Karman, who was at Caltech,
[00:37:31.638 --> 00:37:36.199]  What we now call today the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, JPL.
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:42.961]  In the in crowd, JPL is actually known by another acronym, Jack Parsons Lab.
[00:37:43.581 --> 00:37:54.624]  Because what Jack Parsons did, this young kid, again another prodigal, he was able to create a solid fuel mixture that literally launched the space program.
[00:37:55.385 --> 00:38:00.366]  It wasn't Goddard, it wasn't the Germans, it was Jack Parsons.
[00:38:00.973 --> 00:38:15.689]  Who in his day job was this brilliant chemist creating amazing rocket fuel mixtures that ultimately were powerful and stable that became the baseline for JPL in various rocket series.
[00:38:15.809 --> 00:38:21.956]  And then meanwhile in mainline history about Crowley and all these people and Parsons and of course the founder of Scientology,
[00:38:23.217 --> 00:38:31.901]  Parsons is involved in sex cult rituals to channel entities to tell him, I don't know if you know about this, you probably do, to tell him how to make all these things.
[00:38:31.961 --> 00:38:33.501]  I mean, I'm not saying it's real, folks.
[00:38:33.741 --> 00:38:34.842]  The point is, they believe it.
[00:38:35.422 --> 00:38:36.042]  Well, no, wait, wait.
[00:38:36.542 --> 00:38:40.824]  What Parsons did, you know, in his day job, was separate from what he did with Crowley.
[00:38:41.484 --> 00:38:48.947]  He became part of the Philema cult, the OOTO, which is Crowley's organization in Southern California.
[00:38:49.696 --> 00:38:51.997]  He ultimately wound up leading it.
[00:38:52.097 --> 00:39:03.600]  He became the head of it in Southern California, simultaneous with working on the foundations of rocket technology, which would bootstrap NASA into space.
[00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:07.321]  Now, how does the founder of Scientology tie in?
[00:39:07.501 --> 00:39:16.123]  Ed, what's his name, L. Ron Hubbard, became also a member of the Malema Group there in Pasadena with Hubbard.
[00:39:16.698 --> 00:39:24.123]  and he and and and uh... well i'm sorry he he impartial and then they kind of swap wives and there was i mean it's a huge
[00:39:24.927 --> 00:39:34.252]  Really interesting soap opera, an incredible soap opera that no one knows underlying the whole Western contingent of what is now today NASA, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
[00:39:34.452 --> 00:39:53.202]  Yeah, we have this gleaming white image of, you know, handsome go-get-em America, you know, perfect people who just are totally mom and apple pie, and meanwhile it's a bunch of Nazis, a bunch of lunatic 33rd degree masons, and a bunch of psycho... Wait, wait, wait, Alex, Alex, the 33rd degree masons founded the United States.
[00:39:54.375 --> 00:39:55.255]  I'm fully aware of that.
[00:39:55.295 --> 00:39:58.857]  You have to separate the Masons from the other two groups.
[00:40:00.458 --> 00:40:01.418]  You know as well as I do.
[00:40:01.458 --> 00:40:02.419]  I mean, let's be clear.
[00:40:02.839 --> 00:40:04.620]  I know that a lot of the founders were Masons.
[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:17.166]  They also then wrote about how they didn't like that their Masonry was being taken over by... Masonry in the 1800s was taken over by a guy who created the Ku Klux Klan, whose name was... Albert Pike.
[00:40:17.426 --> 00:40:21.008]  So I want to be clear that the Masons today... The Bourne Masonry.
[00:40:21.068 --> 00:40:23.429]  The ordinary Masons today haven't a clue.
[00:40:23.993 --> 00:40:25.214]  We're talking about the in-crowd.
[00:40:25.234 --> 00:40:27.275]  I mean, I have some very good friends that are Masons.
[00:40:27.295 --> 00:40:29.176]  Yeah, sure, the porch Masons are nice guys.
[00:40:29.236 --> 00:40:30.898]  Enjoying it, because George Washington was in it.
[00:40:31.318 --> 00:40:34.340]  And that's my point with any intelligence agent.
[00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:37.222]  Remember, remember, the lie is different at every level.
[00:40:37.302 --> 00:40:38.663]  Yes, so I'm sorry.
[00:40:38.783 --> 00:40:40.123]  I'm going to make that as a bumper sticker.
[00:40:40.184 --> 00:40:41.504]  That has got to be a bumper sticker.
[00:40:42.105 --> 00:40:45.487]  Because that is such a key to figuring all this out.
[00:40:45.967 --> 00:40:48.409]  Because each level, Alex, as you and I know,
[00:40:49.025 --> 00:40:54.931]  is told just enough to keep them going in the same direction, but they're not told the big story.
[00:40:55.151 --> 00:40:58.755]  Exactly, so we're not here saying all nations are bad, I'm saying at the top.
[00:40:58.775 --> 00:41:01.798]  No, but they think they're told the full truth.
[00:41:01.858 --> 00:41:03.981]  That's the way to control the crowd.
[00:41:04.021 --> 00:41:04.821]  Well, here's an example.
[00:41:04.942 --> 00:41:09.346]  Every major Masonic lodge, of both arms of it, they
[00:41:10.367 --> 00:41:12.188]  You know, the Grand Orient and the Scottish Rite.
[00:41:12.228 --> 00:41:14.270]  They have pictures of Albert Pike in every building.
[00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:16.612]  And they have statues of him in D.C.
[00:41:16.672 --> 00:41:17.692]  right by the Supreme Court.
[00:41:18.273 --> 00:41:24.417]  But meanwhile, do they read his book saying he's possessed by Lucifer and that Jesus isn't God?
[00:41:24.517 --> 00:41:27.399]  I mean, do they read Manly P. Hall saying they worship?
[00:41:27.459 --> 00:41:28.740]  I mean, these are the head Masons.
[00:41:29.281 --> 00:41:37.567]  And then a Mason will argue with you and say it's not Lucifer, when their own Grand Supreme Masters are saying, yes, I am possessed by Lucifer, sweet Lucifer.
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:47.745]  Anyway, we both agree that the Masonic, you know, the ancient tradition were the good guys, and we're trying to enlighten humankind.
[00:41:47.805 --> 00:41:51.848]  That's why the Founders were doing this incredible experiment called the United States.
[00:41:52.248 --> 00:41:58.512]  And ever since this country was formed, we've had group after group and, you know, conspiracy after conspiracy.
[00:41:58.552 --> 00:42:00.253]  Trying to get control of that engine!
[00:42:00.793 --> 00:42:06.157]  To tear it down, to take control, to divert it from whatever its historical destiny.
[00:42:06.917 --> 00:42:08.600]  Was and is supposed to be.
[00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:09.522]  Remember Lincoln?
[00:42:09.982 --> 00:42:12.166]  The last best hope of mankind.
[00:42:12.246 --> 00:42:13.428]  I still believe that Alex.
[00:42:13.869 --> 00:42:17.856]  That's why it's important to return it to its original path.
[00:42:18.497 --> 00:42:18.897]  Critical.
[00:42:19.358 --> 00:42:20.761]  If we're going to survive what's coming.
[00:42:22.165 --> 00:42:31.332]  Alright, we've got a break, but I want to talk behind the scenes for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, also internet listeners who are listening to the InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com streams.
[00:42:31.372 --> 00:42:33.014]  You'll be able to hear this 3 minutes behind the scenes.
[00:42:33.674 --> 00:42:48.105]  I've got to have Richard T. Hoagland up for 3-4 hours if he'll do it in the next month or so, because it's clear we've got about an hour and 5 minutes left, or less than an hour, it's about 40 minutes left, and there's just millions of questions I want to ask, points I want to bring up.
[00:42:48.826 --> 00:42:52.125]  Let's get into what's happening right now at NASA when we get back.
[00:42:53.712 --> 00:42:57.495]  Okay, I'm going to go ahead and go back to Richard C. Hoagland.
[00:42:58.156 --> 00:43:12.928]  Again, we'll come back and get into what's happening with the attempted murders and NASA seeming like it's totally dysfunctional, everything you warned about 15 years ago that nobody believed, and now you've been proven to be quite a prophet on that count.
[00:43:13.709 --> 00:43:20.855]  But just going back to these three cults, I got from what you said that the Nazis dominate that.
[00:43:21.335 --> 00:43:24.519]  See, this is an interesting question, which I don't have an answer to, because they've gotten much more sophisticated.
[00:43:38.553 --> 00:43:42.055]  Has just written a new book called The Fourth Reich or Rise of the Fourth Reich or whatever.
[00:43:42.075 --> 00:43:43.315]  Yeah, I'm gonna give him one.
[00:43:43.836 --> 00:43:46.097]  The modern Fourth Reich doesn't advertise.
[00:43:46.117 --> 00:43:47.357]  They don't wear the armbands.
[00:43:47.438 --> 00:43:49.118]  They don't go to the meetings.
[00:43:49.198 --> 00:43:52.860]  So there's no way to know, Alex, that's what's so insidious.
[00:43:53.901 --> 00:43:59.083]  The old guard, the old guys, we basically knew, okay, we brought the Nazis over and we want to follow what they're doing and all that.
[00:43:59.884 --> 00:44:04.126]  The new guys, we don't know who they are and how deeply they're involved.
[00:44:05.462 --> 00:44:15.567]  The only thing we can do is to look at what they're doing, the facts of what they're doing, and the facts are that what they're doing is not consistent with what they claim they're doing.
[00:44:15.587 --> 00:44:23.591]  In other words, there is a NASA program now called the Vision for Space Exploration, which is supposed to take us back to the moon and on to Mars.
[00:44:24.531 --> 00:44:26.452]  It is a catastrophe.
[00:44:26.833 --> 00:44:27.693]  It is a tragedy.
[00:44:27.853 --> 00:44:29.954]  It is a slow-moving train wreck.
[00:44:30.514 --> 00:44:33.616]  It is never going to accomplish what it claims to be doing.
[00:44:34.699 --> 00:44:41.923]  It's almost as if it's been sabotaged step-by-step-by-step along the way by the dishonest guys.
[00:44:42.003 --> 00:44:46.185]  We'll make them think, you know, we'll call them the Nazis.
[00:44:47.085 --> 00:44:54.550]  Whereas the most of the agency is honest and still believes in the original principles and what they thought they were doing.
[00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:58.033]  But they're so compartmentalized, they don't know exactly.
[00:44:58.353 --> 00:45:04.297]  And I would imagine most of the energy is used, not for actual exploration, but to just compartmentalize.
[00:45:05.078 --> 00:45:09.741]  Well, it's basically used to keep the doors open, the lights on, in ten NASA centers around the country.
[00:45:09.761 --> 00:45:11.882]  There's 19,000, 18,000 people working for NASA now, and those salaries
[00:45:16.041 --> 00:45:17.182]  Take off a lot of change.
[00:45:17.762 --> 00:45:23.546]  And when your budget is around 16 bills, 17 bills a year, that's nothing in today's budget.
[00:45:23.626 --> 00:45:26.128]  How can you spend that in one week in Iraq?
[00:45:26.809 --> 00:45:35.054]  Richard, we're about to come back live for the main audience, but just behind the scenes now, can I get you up for like two hours in the next few weeks?
[00:45:35.535 --> 00:45:35.755]  Sure.
[00:45:36.115 --> 00:45:40.919]  Okay, because this is really interesting and I want to do a part two before people forget about the part one.
[00:45:41.259 --> 00:45:43.861]  Okay, we're going live right now and I want to kind of
[00:45:44.421 --> 00:45:52.388]  In the next 40 minutes I've got, will you just hit as many topics and as many points as we can and try to get some short answers because you've got so much knowledge.
[00:45:52.408 --> 00:45:56.992]  Here we go.
[00:46:01.536 --> 00:46:03.797]  Richard C. Hoagland is our guest.
[00:46:03.838 --> 00:46:08.441]  The book, Dark Mission, The Secret History of NASA.
[00:46:08.541 --> 00:46:10.363]  And we've hardly covered any of what's in it.
[00:46:10.383 --> 00:46:11.844]  I'd like to have him back up in the near future.
[00:46:13.254 --> 00:46:14.855]  We've got him into the middle of the next hour.
[00:46:14.875 --> 00:46:22.980]  Then we have that NFL player who walked across the country to raise money for 9-11 first responders who've been forgotten.
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:28.003]  Part of focusing in on the release of Truth Rising coming up on July 4th.
[00:46:28.343 --> 00:46:30.424]  My new film gets into that and other subjects.
[00:46:31.525 --> 00:46:32.465]  Richard C. Hoagland.
[00:46:33.486 --> 00:46:34.306]  Skipping ahead now.
[00:46:34.346 --> 00:46:35.627]  We looked at the founding of it.
[00:46:35.747 --> 00:46:38.169]  Weird secret agency controlled by the president.
[00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:52.994]  Then to today, and I know people from Houston, I know a Hollywood producer who's very serious, doesn't make stuff up, you know, saying that there were magnet programs run by NASA and that he was really in a mind control program with NASA.
[00:46:53.134 --> 00:46:54.715]  I looked that up, turns out they did it.
[00:46:54.935 --> 00:46:57.496]  They are associated with that over and over again.
[00:46:58.256 --> 00:46:59.237]  What about mind control?
[00:46:59.257 --> 00:47:02.038]  I mean, did you ever, do you have any info on that?
[00:47:02.642 --> 00:47:03.683]  Well, let me back up.
[00:47:03.723 --> 00:47:08.486]  You've given me a statement that I want to disagree with, gently, politely, with all due respect.
[00:47:08.506 --> 00:47:09.607]  That's fine, go ahead.
[00:47:10.067 --> 00:47:11.668]  You said NASA controlled by the President.
[00:47:12.029 --> 00:47:13.390]  That's the big lie.
[00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:14.650]  It wasn't.
[00:47:15.291 --> 00:47:20.995]  From the get-go, from the beginning, when Eisenhower created this agency, he thought he was in charge.
[00:47:21.735 --> 00:47:26.199]  And then, by the time his term was ended, his second term, remember his famous speech?
[00:47:26.219 --> 00:47:26.999]  Well, that's what I mean.
[00:47:27.039 --> 00:47:29.461]  It's a stand-alone agency outside government.
[00:47:30.325 --> 00:47:37.070]  Well, it's part of a series of agencies that are controlled from some quarter.
[00:47:37.350 --> 00:47:38.891]  It's the shadow government, sure, sure.
[00:47:39.431 --> 00:47:42.053]  Well, but is it really even the shadow government?
[00:47:42.954 --> 00:47:44.195]  I'm beginning to suspect it.
[00:47:44.235 --> 00:47:45.336]  Do you know Joseph Farrell?
[00:47:46.356 --> 00:47:46.616]  Yes.
[00:47:47.777 --> 00:47:48.418]  Have you had him on?
[00:47:49.018 --> 00:47:49.899]  No, I don't believe so.
[00:47:50.099 --> 00:47:51.680]  You need to have Joseph Farrell on.
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:55.202]  Joseph is working with me on the sequel to Dark Mission.
[00:47:55.823 --> 00:47:57.204]  Joseph is a genius.
[00:47:57.244 --> 00:47:58.725]  He's a PhD Oxford.
[00:47:59.235 --> 00:47:59.976]  He is a genius.
[00:48:00.016 --> 00:48:25.852]  What he has done is he has, with documents and meticulous reasoning and research, and doing it the old-fashioned way, you know, science, actually documenting what you think you found, he has discovered the most extraordinary antecedents to the genesis of NASA in the end of the Third Reich in Germany, and a series of black projects that were brought here
[00:48:26.548 --> 00:48:31.770]  And seem to form the nucleus of a secret, hidden space program.
[00:48:32.490 --> 00:48:33.911]  You see... Oh, absolutely!
[00:48:33.971 --> 00:48:37.052]  I mean, we know NASA is the cover for the real program.
[00:48:37.252 --> 00:48:40.954]  NASA is not... is a false front, Western Town, as I say over and over and over again.
[00:48:41.214 --> 00:48:44.215]  And part of the reason why there is such disarray now
[00:48:44.949 --> 00:48:50.674]  Well, they can't seem to get their act together while we're building this thing in orbit that's going nowhere and sucking billions of dollars.
[00:48:50.714 --> 00:48:52.495]  They want to suppress technology.
[00:48:52.535 --> 00:48:55.117]  They don't want the public to know what's really been developed.
[00:48:55.157 --> 00:48:55.778]  And here's an example.
[00:48:55.798 --> 00:48:59.280]  Raymond Teague, NASA engineer, Air Force intelligence before that.
[00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:02.223]  You know, he's on the Apollo program, you know, in mission controls.
[00:49:02.243 --> 00:49:03.003]  You see pictures of him.
[00:49:03.424 --> 00:49:04.144]  Good friend of mine.
[00:49:04.765 --> 00:49:09.048]  He's come in and he said, look, you know, he was working with RCA on the cameras on the moon.
[00:49:09.409 --> 00:49:12.071]  He was working on RCA with the stuff in Skylab after that.
[00:49:12.631 --> 00:49:18.418]  And he said, he believes they went to the moon, but a lot of it was even covered up from them, what they were really doing.
[00:49:18.438 --> 00:49:22.383]  And he said, the Van Allen radiation belt does fry the film.
[00:49:22.704 --> 00:49:25.067]  He saw canisters and capsules that were tested.
[00:49:25.407 --> 00:49:28.391]  He said they were on the moon, but that they faked the photos.
[00:49:28.631 --> 00:49:29.793]  And he says he doesn't know why.
[00:49:29.833 --> 00:49:30.454]  What do you say to that?
[00:49:31.192 --> 00:49:32.332]  Well, I think he's wrong.
[00:49:33.013 --> 00:49:40.095]  There is some film degradation, but they went through the belt so quickly and those canisters were put in lead for exactly that purpose.
[00:49:40.595 --> 00:49:42.375]  We've got stunning artifacts on the moon.
[00:49:42.395 --> 00:49:45.936]  I mean, you can't fake what we've got in these pictures that are NASA pictures.
[00:49:46.957 --> 00:49:49.417]  What's interesting is we've had some NASA sources ourselves.
[00:49:49.517 --> 00:49:53.999]  Ken Johnston is a key guy, who by the way is a 32nd degree mason.
[00:49:54.679 --> 00:49:57.920]  And it was his masonic tradition, you know, as one of the good guys,
[00:49:58.689 --> 00:50:13.904]  When he started asking his own questions of his own experience in NASA after he read The Monuments of Mars, my first book, he met me in Seattle and he gave me access to an incredible archive of NASA photography that he had been ordered to destroy in Houston
[00:50:14.392 --> 00:50:17.135]  And he had disobeyed orders and kept it for 30 years.
[00:50:17.235 --> 00:50:24.902]  Kind of like I've talked to the people for Time Lapse Books that were told to destroy the evidence at the back of Kennedy's head blown off, and I've seen those photos.
[00:50:25.342 --> 00:50:26.103]  They need to release them.
[00:50:26.183 --> 00:50:28.165]  I'll tell you what, Richard C. Hoagland, stay there.
[00:50:28.225 --> 00:50:29.566]  Back in 60 seconds.
[00:50:34.650 --> 00:50:36.212]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:50:37.153 --> 00:50:39.455]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:42.583 --> 00:50:44.244]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:50:44.545 --> 00:50:47.987]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:50:48.167 --> 00:50:50.029]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:50:50.629 --> 00:50:53.351]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:50:53.652 --> 00:50:59.136]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:50:59.396 --> 00:51:03.319]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:51:03.639 --> 00:51:08.562]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[00:51:08.842 --> 00:51:11.603]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.
[00:51:11.883 --> 00:51:18.727]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded or streamed in super high quality directly to your computer or iPhone and shared with others.
[00:51:19.107 --> 00:51:24.930]  Thousands of special video reports, from tainted vaccines to martial law, can be found in this online video library.
[00:51:25.070 --> 00:51:29.172]  My weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much
[00:51:30.458 --> 00:51:31.879]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:09.047 --> 00:52:16.950]  Richard C. Hoagland is our guest for another 30 minutes.
[00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:19.051]  Gotta have him back up sooner rather than later.
[00:52:22.617 --> 00:52:25.481]  Okay Richard, there's so much to cover.
[00:52:25.521 --> 00:52:27.704]  Obviously we're scratching the surface of Dark Mission.
[00:52:27.764 --> 00:52:28.725]  Very impressive book.
[00:52:29.866 --> 00:52:31.969]  No doubt NASA is covering up a lot.
[00:52:32.770 --> 00:52:34.913]  I guess all bets are off then.
[00:52:34.953 --> 00:52:36.875]  We can speculate all day.
[00:52:38.617 --> 00:52:42.159]  But there are some things that we can prove they're covering up.
[00:52:43.279 --> 00:52:49.001]  What about my question about NASA or the real program behind it in mind control?
[00:52:49.041 --> 00:53:00.286]  Because in government documents, in government hearings, NASA keeps popping up over the years, and then from separate sources it keeps popping up, and you're one of the foremost experts on NASA outside of its system now.
[00:53:00.966 --> 00:53:02.707]  Does that ever come across your radar screen?
[00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:06.521]  Well, it certainly did in a very curious way.
[00:53:07.101 --> 00:53:11.541]  First of all, let me say that there are, if you go to Google, Google is your friend.
[00:53:11.601 --> 00:53:15.862]  That's, you know, besides the lie is different at every level, the other mantra is Google is your friend.
[00:53:16.502 --> 00:53:18.283]  Use Google liberally, freely.
[00:53:18.483 --> 00:53:19.683]  It's an amazing tool.
[00:53:19.983 --> 00:53:22.923]  The Internet, I wish you realized that we wouldn't have a prayer if we didn't have the Internet.
[00:53:23.764 --> 00:53:31.205]  The Internet, you know, thank God for Bill Gates and DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency, which gave us the Internet.
[00:53:32.103 --> 00:53:36.587]  Um, has given us the tools to fight and fight effectively, because information is power.
[00:53:37.127 --> 00:53:42.991]  So what you do is you go to Google, and you start looking at all the patents from mind control.
[00:53:43.572 --> 00:53:44.392]  They're right out there.
[00:53:45.073 --> 00:53:50.397]  This is not airy-fairy, you know... By the way, speaking of Google, they're now in bed with NASA, but go ahead.
[00:53:51.278 --> 00:53:59.584]  Well, they've been in bed for quite a while with certain interesting agencies, but the information is there if you go look for it.
[00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:04.881]  Google mind-control technologies, mind-altering technologies.
[00:54:04.941 --> 00:54:08.283]  We all know, or most of this audience probably knows, but MKUltra.
[00:54:08.963 --> 00:54:20.727]  It looks like they've been at the idea of manipulating and mind-controlling other people, the other side, whoever the enemy is, and we're, in their eyes, the enemy, for a long, long time.
[00:54:20.747 --> 00:54:22.247]  20, 30, 40 years.
[00:54:23.027 --> 00:54:24.448]  The question is, how good are they?
[00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:41.764]  I think that NASA, if they themselves did not have the technology, were allied with those agencies that did have the technology, that developed it, out of World War II, the Nazis, we're back to the Nazis and those weird medical experiments again that we've all heard about.
[00:54:42.885 --> 00:54:51.051]  I ran into this first person when I was invited to Wyoming back in the early 90s.
[00:54:52.406 --> 00:54:58.929]  To do a series of programs for the school district in, in one of the southern towns, I think it was Billings.
[00:55:00.049 --> 00:55:07.332]  And I would have been invited by a former CIA guy, who was married to a doctor, a medical doctor.
[00:55:08.493 --> 00:55:14.315]  And what I decided, because they wanted me to come out and talk about the Mars stuff, based on what I talked about at the UN.
[00:55:15.336 --> 00:55:17.937]  And instead, I unveiled a surprise.
[00:55:18.437 --> 00:55:20.238]  Because at this Billings conference,
[00:55:20.953 --> 00:55:26.016]  For the first time, I talked about the structures we had found upon the moon.
[00:55:27.056 --> 00:55:34.400]  Well, Alex, you would have thought I had taken a small nuclear weapon and detonated it in the middle of the conference.
[00:55:35.561 --> 00:55:47.087]  I literally was manhandled by this guy, and put up against a wall, and browbeat for not following what I had said I was going to talk about, etc., etc., etc.
[00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:52.343]  Now, you know that Wyoming is one of the places where they put these CIA guys out to pasture?
[00:55:53.523 --> 00:55:58.227]  They buy them all ranches, and they live like kings, and basically it's CIA country.
[00:55:58.307 --> 00:56:05.191]  Montana, Wyoming... Well, not just that, they're putting them in, FBI, CIA, almost every major sheriff.
[00:56:06.572 --> 00:56:12.636]  Well, this was a retired intel guy, who of course is never retired, but here's the nub of the story.
[00:56:13.911 --> 00:56:22.756]  When we were doing this conference, we were setting it up with this guy and his wife, and his wife was a medical doctor.
[00:56:23.636 --> 00:56:34.622]  And at one point, one of the people I was with was trying to get her to talk about her experiences, and she revealed that she had been part of the quarantine team.
[00:56:35.535 --> 00:56:39.221]  Debriefing the astronauts when they came back from the moon.
[00:56:39.441 --> 00:56:40.142]  Wow, stay there.
[00:56:40.202 --> 00:56:42.265]  Let's tie all this together after the break.
[00:56:42.285 --> 00:56:47.012]  A quick break, we're going to talk behind the scenes as well, but we'll finish up with that story when we get back from the main audience.
[00:56:47.373 --> 00:56:47.834]  Stay with me.
[00:56:55.382 --> 00:57:05.408]  Again, Richard, this is kind of schizophrenic how we do this, but I don't want to waste the time, because we'll tell one little three-minute story here and then come back with the other story after, but that way you don't waste your time with the ads.
[00:57:06.669 --> 00:57:10.032]  And folks really do like it, and I appreciate you coming on.
[00:57:10.592 --> 00:57:11.873]  I hope you're having a good time on the show.
[00:57:13.010 --> 00:57:15.212]  It's just too brief.
[00:57:15.392 --> 00:57:18.194]  I'm going to have to have you on four or five hours or two or three more interviews.
[00:57:18.855 --> 00:57:25.781]  When we get back I want to hear the rest of the story and then go into what's happening with the modern NASA system.
[00:57:30.004 --> 00:57:36.110]  What is your opinion on how advanced NASA really is from all the pieces of data you've got and how much of their
[00:57:38.257 --> 00:57:40.097]  You know, ShadowNASA or whatever you want to call it.
[00:57:41.518 --> 00:57:44.278]  I mean, just how big and powerful that really is and what they've really developed.
[00:57:44.958 --> 00:57:46.439]  Well, again, I'm a data guy.
[00:57:46.859 --> 00:57:52.460]  You know, I don't like wild speculation, even though people, my enemies, accuse me of incredible wild speculation.
[00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:55.520]  Everything that we talk about, we can support with evidence.
[00:57:56.561 --> 00:58:05.542]  If you go to the various websites, like YouTube, and you download the shuttle video, STS-48 and STS-80,
[00:58:08.416 --> 00:58:19.561]  And you look at the events going on in this official NASA video of these bizarre crafts streaking around doing 200,000 G maneuvers.
[00:58:19.581 --> 00:58:26.544]  200,000 times the force of gravity that would smear an occupant all over the walls of the cabin like, you know, toothpaste.
[00:58:27.164 --> 00:58:30.065]  And you see them doing this with abandon, freely.
[00:58:30.926 --> 00:58:34.327]  You are looking at spacecraft, obviously, that are not rockets.
[00:58:34.587 --> 00:58:36.208]  Incredibly advanced technology.
[00:58:37.116 --> 00:58:50.721]  Well, I discovered that all of these maneuvers are taking place over key latitudes on Earth, like 19.5 degrees over the Western Australia Outback, or 19.5 degrees over South America.
[00:58:50.901 --> 00:58:51.581]  So what is it?
[00:58:51.701 --> 00:58:55.583]  I mean, is it... It's a ritual, and it's our spacecraft.
[00:58:55.623 --> 00:58:56.123]  It's human.
[00:58:56.143 --> 00:58:58.144]  It's not UFOs, not aliens, not ETs.
[00:58:59.167 --> 00:59:13.082]  Frankly, I'm beginning to believe the entire ET UFO scenario is another huge lie to cover the secret space program by humans here on Earth, which gets us into why did the Catholic Church
[00:59:13.857 --> 00:59:16.339]  Which, years ago, did some very peculiar things.
[00:59:16.659 --> 00:59:18.681]  Why are they now saying aliens are real?
[00:59:19.221 --> 00:59:24.305]  Not only that, Alex, why are they saying they're our extraterrestrial brothers?
[00:59:24.406 --> 00:59:27.588]  Okay, let's come back and talk about mind control, and then let's get into that.
[00:59:27.648 --> 00:59:28.349]  Let's go right now.
[00:59:28.609 --> 00:59:30.731]  This is just absolutely amazing.
[00:59:30.931 --> 00:59:32.952]  Richard C. Hoagland is our guest.
[00:59:33.012 --> 00:59:34.754]  Enterprise Institute.
[00:59:34.794 --> 00:59:35.975]  Give out all the sites again.
[00:59:36.275 --> 00:59:38.497]  Alright, EnterpriseMission.com.
[00:59:38.697 --> 00:59:39.718]  Think of a mission, Alex.
[00:59:39.978 --> 00:59:44.804]  EnterpriseMission.com and then you've also got the DarkMission.net.
[00:59:45.144 --> 00:59:46.205]  DarkMission.net.
[00:59:46.245 --> 00:59:49.289]  Everything you wanted to know about what's in Dark Mission and didn't know who to ask.
[00:59:49.409 --> 00:59:49.990]  Okay, here we go.
[00:59:57.159 --> 00:59:57.800]  Big Brother.
[00:59:58.460 --> 00:59:59.501]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:00.241 --> 01:00:01.342]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:01.983 --> 01:00:02.803]  You want answers?
[01:00:03.564 --> 01:00:04.465]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:04.485 --> 01:00:08.728]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:09.329 --> 01:00:13.432]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:16.474 --> 01:00:18.956]  It's an amazing discussion with Richard C. Hoagland.
[01:00:19.236 --> 01:00:20.717]  Really thankful for him being with us.
[01:00:23.059 --> 01:00:25.161]  Darkmission.net's the website for the book.
[01:00:27.039 --> 01:00:52.481]  Consultant to NASA, curator of a major museum, helped design the gold tablet, you know, message to the stars, sent out on one of the more famous spacecraft, worked with CBS News and Walter Cronkite, and now the biggest whistleblower out there on NASA corruption, and so much of what I've been talking about 15 years ago has now come out, that's what blows me away, because I try to just focus in on what I can prove,
[01:00:53.081 --> 01:00:56.282]  And reading his book, so much of it I can prove, and that's what scares me.
[01:00:56.802 --> 01:00:57.422]  Mind control.
[01:00:57.442 --> 01:00:58.903]  You were finishing up with mind control.
[01:00:59.403 --> 01:01:06.786]  So you're out at this event, you bring up cover-ups of things on the moon, and this guy literally bulls up against you, shoves you up against a wall.
[01:01:07.166 --> 01:01:11.327]  His wife's some government physician that works with the astronauts.
[01:01:11.367 --> 01:01:13.708]  So finish that up, and then I want to get into these
[01:01:14.608 --> 01:01:24.151]  These official videos they've shown on the news from the space shuttle with these craft flying around and Richard, again, we don't talk about little green men here.
[01:01:24.471 --> 01:01:32.053]  These are official government footage and Hoagland believes it's all part of a larger government program.
[01:01:32.073 --> 01:01:33.974]  But get back to the mind control first, sir.
[01:01:35.083 --> 01:01:43.407]  Well, we were having this dinner one night and, you know, basically when you go into a new town, you meet new people, your host, and we were staying there and all that.
[01:01:43.427 --> 01:01:47.089]  It was very social and very protocol and all that.
[01:01:47.109 --> 01:01:49.810]  Um, they did not know yet what I was going to talk about.
[01:01:50.451 --> 01:02:02.817]  So, it was kind of, you know, you're a friend, you're a friend of a friend of ours, you're going to do this thing for the school the next couple of days, you know, and so I would just started asking questions, you know, what are you doing here and what do you used to do?
[01:02:03.703 --> 01:02:04.324]  What did you do?
[01:02:04.344 --> 01:02:12.753]  I discovered that his wife, this intel agent's wife, CIA guy in real life, was a doctor, medical doctor.
[01:02:13.393 --> 01:02:19.780]  And that she had been part of the team debriefing in the quarantine the astronauts coming back from the moon.
[01:02:21.141 --> 01:02:26.067]  And, you know, I'm trying to be very diplomatic and not give away what I'm going to talk about the next day.
[01:02:27.205 --> 01:02:44.854]  The next day when I laid my bombshell on everybody that we found structures on the moon from the Apollo program and the other programs and showed the photographs, the reaction was so bizarre because not only was I slammed up against the wall by this guy and basically threatened, but his wife
[01:02:45.675 --> 01:02:47.677]  Never would come to the conference.
[01:02:48.117 --> 01:02:49.238]  She orbited around.
[01:02:49.438 --> 01:03:01.008]  She would go to a coffee shop down the street and have coffee, or she would go to the supermarket, or she would go and, you know, go back to the house, but she would never came to the whole... Through a three-day, she never came to the conference.
[01:03:01.769 --> 01:03:11.797]  One of my associates, who'd kind of gotten friendly with her, because I was there with several other people, kind of got her aside at one point and was asking her some questions.
[01:03:12.466 --> 01:03:21.533]  And it turns out that even though she remembered that she'd been part of the team to debrief the astronauts, she couldn't remember a thing that they said.
[01:03:22.294 --> 01:03:26.277]  She couldn't remember why she no longer was working with NASA.
[01:03:26.938 --> 01:03:38.267]  She couldn't remember... In other words, her memory lapses were enormous, and I don't think they were faint, because we now found the same pattern in all the flight crews, starting with Ed Mitchell.
[01:03:39.053 --> 01:03:50.060]  Ed Mitchell, when he and I did the debate with Art some years ago, live, coast-to-coast, admitted freely that he was very troubled when he came back to Earth after Apollo 14.
[01:03:50.740 --> 01:04:00.166]  And a young kid at one of these school events, because they all did school events, you know, exciting the next generation, one of the kids asked him, what did it feel like, Dr. Mitchell, to walk on the moon?
[01:04:01.147 --> 01:04:05.850]  And he realized, he admitted in his own book, The Way of the Explorer, Ed Mitchell's book,
[01:04:06.641 --> 01:04:17.610]  And he admitted again on the air with Art and me that night that what troubled him immensely is he could not remember what it felt like to walk on the moon.
[01:04:18.671 --> 01:04:21.193]  Now, Ed is a very emotional guy.
[01:04:21.313 --> 01:04:23.815]  He's a scientist, you know, but he's one of the more emotional.
[01:04:23.835 --> 01:04:26.257]  In other words, he's not repressing his emotions.
[01:04:26.857 --> 01:04:31.021]  So for him not to remember the emotions really bothered him.
[01:04:31.061 --> 01:04:35.284]  And it got so bad that he actually went to a therapist to try to have post-hypnotic
[01:04:35.669 --> 01:04:40.013]  Regression, to see why it was he couldn't remember the feeling.
[01:04:40.053 --> 01:04:41.714]  He remembered the mission plan.
[01:04:41.734 --> 01:04:49.961]  We did this, we did that, you know, Station A, Station B, we traversed the Earth, you know, turned this on, all that, but he couldn't remember the emotions.
[01:04:50.801 --> 01:04:59.628]  And when he got in the therapy session, it turned out that there was a block so big that he literally could not be regressed through it.
[01:04:59.668 --> 01:05:01.310]  He could not penetrate the block.
[01:05:01.650 --> 01:05:04.032]  He would say things like, oh, that's not important, I don't need to know that.
[01:05:04.910 --> 01:05:22.520]  So, this is one clue, the major clue I have, that the astronauts, probably, when they look into the camera and they say there's nothing there, or they say that Hogan's nuts or whatever, they're telling from their perspective the truth, because the awful truth, Alex, is they have been brainwashed.
[01:05:22.601 --> 01:05:23.961]  They have been mind-controlled.
[01:05:24.281 --> 01:05:28.304]  They have had a technology, a very sophisticated technology,
[01:05:28.917 --> 01:05:31.719]  Which took away the real missions that they experienced.
[01:05:31.739 --> 01:05:37.842]  Now we have had a few of the astronauts come out and say that they did see craft on the moon, around the moon, and around the Earth.
[01:05:37.862 --> 01:05:38.303]  Those are lies.
[01:05:38.463 --> 01:05:39.063]  Those are lies.
[01:05:39.143 --> 01:05:40.164]  That's more digression.
[01:05:40.184 --> 01:05:41.285]  That's more disinformation.
[01:05:41.965 --> 01:05:43.446]  That's absolutely not true.
[01:05:44.126 --> 01:05:46.007]  What they saw there were structures.
[01:05:46.087 --> 01:05:47.628]  What they saw there was technology.
[01:05:47.668 --> 01:05:48.589]  They were sent there.
[01:05:49.238 --> 01:06:03.501]  The mission of Apollo, I believe, and we lay this out in Dark Mission, was to bring back technology that the in-crowd, the controllers, whoever they are, the people behind NASA, want desperately from the 1960s.
[01:06:03.561 --> 01:06:10.623]  Okay, well let me just stop you right there, because in the second interview I want to spend two hours on that, but I mean, here's what I have to say about the issue.
[01:06:10.963 --> 01:06:16.644]  You mentioned during the last segment we had behind the scenes for presentplanet.tv viewers and folks on the InfoWars.com streams,
[01:06:17.404 --> 01:06:23.968]  Yeah, and I've seen those footage, I remember back in the 90's or whenever it was, seeing it on the news, and NASA released, and why would they release it?
[01:06:25.449 --> 01:06:36.096]  Footage... I mean, what shows, I mean, get into that now, and then you told me that you believe that that is, you know, human, terrestrial... It's our craft, it's our spacecraft.
[01:06:36.116 --> 01:06:43.521]  Well, I mean, regardless, we have to talk about that, because that is on the tape, and lasers shooting up, I mean, it's crazy.
[01:06:44.372 --> 01:06:47.494]  Well, it's not laser, it looks like particle beams or some kind of test.
[01:06:47.694 --> 01:06:49.936]  Where the, where the, where the objective... Yeah, particle beams.
[01:06:50.416 --> 01:06:51.417]  Direct energy weapons.
[01:06:51.757 --> 01:06:56.400]  Yeah, direct energy and... I don't want to get technical, but I mean, just go ahead and get into that for me.
[01:06:56.680 --> 01:07:00.423]  Well, the spacecraft, whatever it is, nimbly dances out of the way.
[01:07:00.483 --> 01:07:12.551]  I mean, this is a technology which can control gravity, controls inertia, does not use something primitive as... So why do we see particle beams, huge ones, firing at things that are, you were saying 200,000 Gs?
[01:07:14.472 --> 01:07:14.612]  Yep.
[01:07:14.952 --> 01:07:16.133]  I mean, go over that.
[01:07:16.953 --> 01:07:21.496]  Well, because I think it's part of a test for if there are bad guys out there.
[01:07:21.716 --> 01:07:26.098]  Or maybe they're doing preparations for factions.
[01:07:26.138 --> 01:07:28.059]  Maybe looking at more than one faction.
[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:30.821]  Remember, these groups tend to fragment.
[01:07:31.241 --> 01:07:32.582]  They fractally fragment.
[01:07:32.962 --> 01:07:36.504]  So that you have wars within wars within wars.
[01:07:36.864 --> 01:07:40.746]  But why would NASA release that footage?
[01:07:41.347 --> 01:07:43.808]  Well, remember, you've got all the good guys at NASA.
[01:07:44.699 --> 01:07:46.700]  And then you've got a few who are not good guys.
[01:07:47.401 --> 01:07:50.703]  The good guys don't know that there's something to keep secret.
[01:07:50.843 --> 01:07:52.204]  Remember, the lies are for the liberal.
[01:07:52.244 --> 01:07:53.785]  They believe the lies they've been told.
[01:07:54.145 --> 01:08:02.791]  So when you set up a structure, an institution, which is supposed to be open and above board and is supposed to present live TV of the shuttle missions, they present live TV!
[01:08:03.737 --> 01:08:08.361]  Now, the controllers can't say, oh, well, you can broadcast this, but you can't broadcast that.
[01:08:08.741 --> 01:08:11.704]  Because the honest guys are going to say, why can't we broadcast that?
[01:08:11.804 --> 01:08:12.144]  Sure.
[01:08:12.164 --> 01:08:14.766]  So, people always say, if this was happening, it would come out.
[01:08:15.227 --> 01:08:16.868]  And it is coming out.
[01:08:17.148 --> 01:08:18.229]  Well, I mean, I agree with you.
[01:08:18.249 --> 01:08:21.492]  When you've got the Catholic Church saying we need to love the aliens, they're our brothers.
[01:08:21.812 --> 01:08:24.154]  When you've got every major denomination saying it.
[01:08:24.875 --> 01:08:27.277]  When you've got all the movies and you've got
[01:08:27.677 --> 01:08:33.001]  You know, in the 80s, huge programs at the Olympics with aliens landing, you know, fake aliens.
[01:08:33.261 --> 01:08:41.066]  And you've got huge things the size of three football fields floating over Dallas and stuff all over the place.
[01:08:41.866 --> 01:08:46.309]  Something's going on in every government documents about fake extraterrestrial landings.
[01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:47.630]  You know, any of this.
[01:08:47.730 --> 01:08:48.090]  Why?
[01:08:48.111 --> 01:08:49.632]  I mean, you believe it's fake.
[01:08:49.672 --> 01:08:51.573]  Remember Operation Northwoods.
[01:08:52.153 --> 01:08:52.433]  Yes.
[01:08:53.134 --> 01:08:53.494]  OK.
[01:08:53.794 --> 01:08:56.056]  Or we can go to the, you know, September 11th.
[01:08:57.290 --> 01:09:03.656]  Governments do huge, big things to sway populations at key nodal points in history.
[01:09:03.676 --> 01:09:04.376]  They love hoaxes!
[01:09:05.277 --> 01:09:07.959]  Yeah, well, this manufactured history is what it is.
[01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:17.187]  We are building... I mean, all my UFO friends... I need to shake them, because they're so... Frankly, they're extremely naive, Alex.
[01:09:17.548 --> 01:09:20.370]  They really believe we're building toward disclosure.
[01:09:21.491 --> 01:09:23.793]  I believe we're building toward a mass
[01:09:24.355 --> 01:09:41.012]  Carefully manufactured fake event where ETs, who are really humans, who are really part of this secret clique, who are probably Nazis, you know, who developed or perfected their technology from World War II, which is why you've got to get, you know, Joseph on.
[01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:44.921]  They are going to basically fake out the world.
[01:09:45.181 --> 01:09:46.902]  Well, now that's been declassified.
[01:09:46.922 --> 01:09:48.663]  The Nazis already had A-bombs.
[01:09:48.683 --> 01:09:50.803]  They call them radiation weapons.
[01:09:51.284 --> 01:09:53.144]  They already had broken the sound barrier.
[01:09:53.164 --> 01:09:54.385]  It's Farrell's research.
[01:09:54.505 --> 01:10:07.790]  And the reason he's got access to this documentation is that when East and West Germany reunited after the wall fell, a huge number of documents from the Polish Secret Service came out.
[01:10:08.749 --> 01:10:16.093]  And in German, of course, which they had purloined and taken back after World War II as part of their spoils from the war.
[01:10:16.833 --> 01:10:18.194]  They have been declassified.
[01:10:18.814 --> 01:10:25.177]  And there's an incredible window on the Nazi black ops program.
[01:10:25.297 --> 01:10:38.224]  The compartmentalized, incredible high-technology efforts that were being funded by the Nazi war machine, particularly toward the end of the war in a desperate effort to win the war, and they fastened their hopes on several key technologies
[01:10:38.964 --> 01:10:44.304]  Some of which appear to be the control of gravity itself.
[01:10:45.270 --> 01:10:52.074]  Which, again, is a separate piece of data from my work, which came at this from a hyper-dimensional physics perspective.
[01:10:52.094 --> 01:10:54.115]  I mean, we know there's a lot of suppressed technology.
[01:10:54.135 --> 01:10:58.557]  I mean, 20 years after the B-2 bomber was already in service, they declassified it.
[01:10:58.797 --> 01:11:00.758]  So we have a lot of cases of that.
[01:11:00.818 --> 01:11:02.519]  We know there's a whole shadow government.
[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:09.243]  This is technology and physics, Alex, that would make anything you think you know like a candle flame compared to a hydrogen bomb.
[01:11:09.986 --> 01:11:13.947]  This is a physics that literally allows you to rearrange time.
[01:11:13.967 --> 01:11:18.048]  Again, those pale beside what I'm talking about, which is torsion field physics, which is another whole program.
[01:11:35.063 --> 01:11:36.945]  Yeah, well, final segment with Richard C. Hoagland.
[01:11:36.965 --> 01:11:41.930]  When we come back, I want to talk about what we know about this giant shadow reality.
[01:11:41.991 --> 01:11:43.012]  I mean, imagine the elites.
[01:11:43.052 --> 01:11:45.454]  They get to know the reality, know what's going on.
[01:11:45.775 --> 01:11:52.382]  We're down here caring about Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt and what they're trying to build, what their endgame is.
[01:11:52.642 --> 01:11:53.663]  Jim Newcomer from Midas.
[01:11:53.863 --> 01:11:54.143]  July 7, 2008.
[01:11:54.223 --> 01:11:54.543]  You know what?
[01:11:54.563 --> 01:11:56.085]  Let me talk to him behind the scenes.
[01:11:56.305 --> 01:11:57.826]  I don't want to waste my time.
[01:11:57.926 --> 01:11:58.987]  John, bring him up.
[01:11:59.027 --> 01:12:01.048]  Let's go ahead and have another behind the scenes discussion.
[01:12:01.068 --> 01:12:01.729]  This is too interesting.
[01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:04.491]  We're going to come back with the endgame in a moment.
[01:12:04.531 --> 01:12:08.694]  But I mean, imagine, you've got all these compartments in these pyramids.
[01:12:08.754 --> 01:12:11.216]  Pyramids within pyramids of compartmentalization.
[01:12:11.236 --> 01:12:12.918]  That's why that's the New World Order symbol.
[01:12:13.698 --> 01:12:17.079]  I mean, we don't know what they've got because they are so secret.
[01:12:17.119 --> 01:12:18.059]  We know they lie so much.
[01:12:18.099 --> 01:12:19.240]  We just know it's advanced.
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:22.541]  Mainline scientists say they're 30 years advanced.
[01:12:22.581 --> 01:12:26.982]  So Richard C. Hoagland, what I'm saying to you is, I'm entertaining what you're saying.
[01:12:27.022 --> 01:12:27.522]  I respect you.
[01:12:27.542 --> 01:12:28.463]  I think you're a great guy.
[01:12:28.483 --> 01:12:34.485]  My only issue is, like you said, dealing with what we know they could be up to.
[01:12:34.505 --> 01:12:37.906]  The fact is, Alex, we have done experiments.
[01:12:38.046 --> 01:12:39.466]  We have our own data.
[01:12:39.766 --> 01:12:42.127]  We have experiments now from the Soviet Union.
[01:12:42.994 --> 01:12:52.257]  30, 40 years when the Iron Curtain came down, you know, when Glasnost finally prevailed, a huge amount of stuff was declassified from the KGB as well.
[01:12:52.897 --> 01:12:54.697]  And we now have put this data together.
[01:12:55.057 --> 01:12:57.858]  We not only know what the physics is, we know what it can do.
[01:12:57.918 --> 01:12:59.038]  We know what it's based on.
[01:12:59.438 --> 01:13:00.799]  We know how to make it work.
[01:13:00.839 --> 01:13:03.760]  We've seen in our own experiments ample evidence.
[01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:10.261]  We've seen experiments across the American landscape and even in Europe that vindicate various parts of this.
[01:13:10.681 --> 01:13:12.422]  And the latest thing I'm working on
[01:13:13.234 --> 01:13:31.308]  It looks like von Braun himself was deeply involved in some of this early physics experimentation, and we've got a paper trail now to what he found that was suppressed by NASA up to and including the current time frame, which allowed us to leapfrog the Russians
[01:13:31.707 --> 01:13:31.807]  Yes.
[01:14:02.268 --> 01:14:04.350]  It's not a matter of belief, it's a matter of data.
[01:14:04.930 --> 01:14:08.154]  You know, again, this is why, if you really want to do this, you've got to read the book.
[01:14:08.754 --> 01:14:09.755]  You have to read the book.
[01:14:09.775 --> 01:14:12.258]  That's why people write books, because you can't do it in an hour and a half.
[01:14:12.298 --> 01:14:13.479]  No, I mean, I've read the book.
[01:14:13.539 --> 01:14:16.041]  I mean, I understand, but we're here still having a radio discussion about it.
[01:14:16.662 --> 01:14:17.983]  Well, you've got to look at the photographs.
[01:14:18.043 --> 01:14:23.509]  The photographs are downloadable from official NASA websites, in addition to Ken Johnston.
[01:14:24.215 --> 01:14:29.957]  We now have a bunch of hidden whistleblowers inside the agency who obviously have figured out that something is not, you know, right.
[01:14:29.977 --> 01:14:39.299]  Okay, well we're going to do a part two on that, then we'll get into all the wild stuff, which, boy, I mean, if that's the case, they're leaking stuff and things like Total Recall.
[01:14:39.859 --> 01:14:40.199]  Yes!
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:41.260]  Of course!
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:48.082]  Total Recall, by the way, I had a good friend at Fox told me was stolen line for line, almost, from Monument to Mars.
[01:14:48.642 --> 01:14:49.242]  My first book.
[01:14:52.003 --> 01:14:53.023]  And who was Arnie, really?
[01:14:55.675 --> 01:14:59.860]  Okay, listen, we're going live here in about a minute.
[01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:02.162]  Just an amazing interview, Richard.
[01:15:03.223 --> 01:15:04.064]  Amazing interview.
[01:15:04.765 --> 01:15:12.633]  Let's come back and just briefly talk about the hierarchy and also talk about what really happened with that crazy astronaut and the attempted murder, okay?
[01:15:12.993 --> 01:15:14.034]  Well, let's do big picture.
[01:15:15.256 --> 01:15:15.396]  Okay.
[01:15:15.416 --> 01:15:16.457]  And give people some context.
[01:15:16.717 --> 01:15:17.238]  Okay, here we go.
[01:15:19.627 --> 01:15:22.070]  ...and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[01:15:22.311 --> 01:15:23.853]  Travel less, meet online.
[01:15:23.933 --> 01:15:26.417]  Go to Webex.com and try Webex free.
[01:15:26.597 --> 01:15:32.045]  Just click the radiographic and enter promo code 500 to get a free trial and a free webcam too.
[01:15:32.065 --> 01:15:32.465]  Hey John!
[01:15:32.506 --> 01:15:33.287]  Remember that code.
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:39.401]  Remember I gave you last- Sydney, finalized a contract in London and demoed our new product in Boston.
[01:15:39.821 --> 01:15:42.022]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[01:15:42.442 --> 01:15:45.523]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[01:15:45.723 --> 01:15:50.364]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[01:15:50.524 --> 01:15:53.285]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date today.
[01:15:54.523 --> 01:15:56.464]  Imagine the power trip of the elite.
[01:15:57.345 --> 01:15:59.006]  They know what the real technologies are.
[01:15:59.066 --> 01:16:00.426]  They know what's really going on.
[01:16:00.446 --> 01:16:05.429]  While we're down here talking about Hollywood squares and the NFL.
[01:16:06.770 --> 01:16:09.892]  Not even knowing the three branches of the transparent government.
[01:16:10.970 --> 01:16:16.892]  We're going to see Hogle, and we're going to have him back up for two hours in the near future to really get into all the wild evidence he's got.
[01:16:16.912 --> 01:16:21.533]  I mean, NASA now basically has admitted they put red filters over the atmosphere to make it look red.
[01:16:21.573 --> 01:16:23.014]  They admit now the sky is blue.
[01:16:24.034 --> 01:16:25.594]  They found ice all over Mars.
[01:16:25.614 --> 01:16:27.815]  I mean, that's the admitted stuff is amazing.
[01:16:28.235 --> 01:16:33.057]  Why would they cover that up in the past and say, oh, we put a red filter on to make the contrast better for you?
[01:16:34.077 --> 01:16:35.118]  to play along with that.
[01:16:36.199 --> 01:16:37.860]  But imagine being members of the elite.
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:44.425]  They get to fight and jostle and always try to get to the next level of the pyramid, to find out more, to be explorers.
[01:16:44.946 --> 01:16:50.790]  It's the ultimate greediness by these people to wall off the general world from true knowledge.
[01:16:52.151 --> 01:16:53.953]  I mean, I want to teach people things.
[01:16:54.033 --> 01:16:54.874]  I want to learn things.
[01:16:54.934 --> 01:16:56.034]  I want to show people things.
[01:16:56.575 --> 01:17:02.520]  I guess they love hoarding all the secret knowledge because it gives them the power, but that's what Ray Kurzweil and all these futurists say.
[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:08.664]  Well, obviously this has been on my mind from the beginning when I started putting the dots together and realized there were two separate realities.
[01:17:08.704 --> 01:17:10.586]  Actually, more than two, but two will basically suffice for now.
[01:17:31.878 --> 01:17:36.202]  And I've been trying to back-engineer what's the endgame, what's the big picture?
[01:17:37.343 --> 01:17:48.132]  Well, one big picture is that the human race is much older and more extraordinary, astounding, astonishing, than anyone has ever been allowed to believe, certainly in modern times.
[01:17:49.253 --> 01:17:57.801]  If you go to ancient texts, ancient wisdom, ancient documents, ancient sacred writings, you find ample evidence that the human race is
[01:17:58.442 --> 01:18:06.811]  Millions and millions and millions of years old, and that we used to have an incredibly fabulous high-tech civilization that allowed human beings to live like gods.
[01:18:07.632 --> 01:18:08.913]  And then something happened.
[01:18:09.554 --> 01:18:13.778]  The Fall, as we term it in the Western idiom, you know, Genesis.
[01:18:14.459 --> 01:18:17.422]  And now we're basically living almost at a sustenance level.
[01:18:18.115 --> 01:18:35.709]  We're being told now that we have to, in the face of extraordinary physical crises of energy, the lifeblood of civilization, without which everybody becomes poor or dead quickly, we're told we have to drill for something which is ridiculous and primitive as oil.
[01:18:35.749 --> 01:18:40.273]  When they have plenty of advanced technologies, they've invented... Oh, there's incredible advanced technologies.
[01:18:40.293 --> 01:18:45.017]  So, the endgame, one of the endgames, is if you control people's sustenance,
[01:18:45.592 --> 01:18:55.021]  If you control the energy in which they live, the resources which they utilize, and the information under which they operate, you control them totally.
[01:18:55.642 --> 01:19:05.471]  So one of the games... And that's it, we're inside a bottle, we're inside a matrix, not an electronic matrix, but garbage being fed into our cerebral cortexes.
[01:19:05.851 --> 01:19:09.194]  And well listen, I have to tell you, that's what all this fits into.
[01:19:09.955 --> 01:19:18.500]  And that's what my instincts and all of my larger knowledge tells me is that if you look at humans, we don't act or behave like anything we see, Terran.
[01:19:18.780 --> 01:19:22.663]  To say we're connected to monkeys and chimpanzees and all the rest of it's a total joke.
[01:19:23.143 --> 01:19:25.985]  And then you do look at Mars and all the legends and the rest of it.
[01:19:26.005 --> 01:19:27.125]  It isn't Martians, folks.
[01:19:27.626 --> 01:19:28.426]  It's us.
[01:19:28.606 --> 01:19:29.587]  I mean, is that what you're saying?
[01:19:30.147 --> 01:19:30.848]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:19:30.908 --> 01:19:32.789]  Now, you have titled your
[01:19:33.656 --> 01:19:36.177]  One of your websites, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:19:36.217 --> 01:19:39.119]  I always thought to myself, what did Alex figure out?
[01:19:39.139 --> 01:19:40.319]  But he realizes... No, that's it.
[01:19:40.359 --> 01:19:41.580]  We're in a false reality.
[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:43.361]  I just don't know what it is.
[01:19:43.381 --> 01:19:44.641]  I know they're building camps.
[01:19:44.961 --> 01:19:48.443]  I know they're poisoning us, dumbing us down, genetic engineering us down.
[01:19:48.723 --> 01:19:58.568]  That's all admitted, and I'm trying to branch out now and at least get people thinking about the next level, because all my instincts tell me there's just unbelievable, fabulous things being hidden from us.
[01:19:58.988 --> 01:20:13.447]  Okay, number two, if you get that they're keeping all the good stuff for themselves, the reason is that if we got access to the good stuff, if we got access to the technologies, the energy, you know, we wouldn't be worried about $4, $5 a gallon gas or $10 a gallon gas.
[01:20:15.310 --> 01:20:24.354]  We would live like people are supposed to live, all six billion of us, who could live lightly on the earth, Alex, with this technology.
[01:20:24.514 --> 01:20:25.315]  And live longer!
[01:20:25.535 --> 01:20:26.195]  And live longer!
[01:20:26.695 --> 01:20:33.779]  Absolutely, and better, and, you know, you could live to two, three hundred and have the virility of your twenties and thirties.
[01:20:34.159 --> 01:20:40.422]  There's extraordinary medical breakthroughs, there's extraordinary physics breakthroughs, technology breakthroughs, energy.
[01:20:40.882 --> 01:20:42.883]  It's all been kept away because
[01:20:43.723 --> 01:20:45.924]  They are supposed to have it, and we're not.
[01:20:46.144 --> 01:20:48.646]  So where does that dichotomy come from?
[01:20:48.886 --> 01:20:50.827]  And by the way, folks, don't roll your eyes at all this.
[01:20:50.867 --> 01:20:52.208]  We know they're lying and suppressing.
[01:20:52.228 --> 01:20:53.468]  We're just trying to find out what it is.
[01:20:53.949 --> 01:20:54.469]  Think about it.
[01:20:54.489 --> 01:21:05.855]  We're already on a planet hurtling through space, all these wonders around you, and you've been taught it's bizarre to question, and that's because there's so many kooks in the alternative movement.
[01:21:06.155 --> 01:21:07.096]  The lie is different at every level.
[01:21:28.894 --> 01:21:32.216]  EnterpriseMission.com and DarkMission.net.
[01:21:32.236 --> 01:21:32.636]  Anytime Alex.
[01:21:32.656 --> 01:21:33.457]  It's been fun.
[01:21:33.497 --> 01:21:34.057]  By all means.
[01:21:34.077 --> 01:21:34.437]  Okay, you too.
[01:21:34.457 --> 01:21:34.517]  Bye.
[01:21:58.411 --> 01:21:59.392]  Okay, you got the next guest on?
[01:21:59.552 --> 01:22:00.113]  Tides again.
[01:22:01.014 --> 01:22:04.857]  EnterpriseMission.com and DarkMission.net.
[01:22:05.258 --> 01:22:08.561]  Okay, hey, I want to get you up in the next few weeks if you'll do it for even longer.
[01:22:08.581 --> 01:22:09.102]  Anytime, Alex.
[01:22:09.602 --> 01:22:10.042]  Thank you, Richard.
[01:22:10.062 --> 01:22:10.423]  It's been fun.
[01:22:10.683 --> 01:22:11.364]  Thank you, Richard.
[01:22:11.384 --> 01:22:13.246]  Let me say bye to you behind the scenes here.
[01:22:14.887 --> 01:22:15.788]  We're on the march.
[01:22:16.268 --> 01:22:17.890]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:22:18.811 --> 01:22:21.474]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:24.893 --> 01:22:30.780]  Attention GCN listeners, would you like to watch uncensored, unregulated, even banned TV on your computer?
[01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:42.354]  Well now you can watch satellite TV on your PC with an extremely simple hookup that allows computer owners to pick up more channels than any sane person can even watch without paying monthly cable or satellite fees.
[01:22:42.754 --> 01:22:43.594]  Here's the story.
[01:22:43.894 --> 01:22:51.757]  New video feed technology lets anyone with a high-speed internet connection gain instant access to an endless list of underground channels from all over the globe.
[01:22:52.057 --> 01:22:53.117]  And here's the best part.
[01:22:53.197 --> 01:22:54.518]  It's 100% legal.
[01:22:54.898 --> 01:23:01.020]  And it works at home, the office, or even in other countries to grab television channels and video feeds at your command.
[01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:05.621]  GCN listeners can use it to watch hundreds of conspiracy videos absolutely free.
[01:23:06.141 --> 01:23:10.305]  Best of all, you could be watching free TV on your PC in five minutes or less.
[01:23:10.465 --> 01:23:11.286]  It's that simple.
[01:23:11.586 --> 01:23:14.909]  Just go to www.orderfreetv.com.
[01:23:15.229 --> 01:23:18.212]  That's www.orderfreetv.com.
[01:23:18.512 --> 01:23:24.117]  To watch unregulated TV on your PC, go to www.orderfreetv.com.
[01:23:24.875 --> 01:23:25.416]  Hey, Bonnie.
[01:23:25.576 --> 01:23:26.998]  No more pickpocketing for us.
[01:23:27.278 --> 01:23:31.423]  I have an easier way we can steal people's credit cards without them even knowing they've been robbed.
[01:23:31.604 --> 01:23:32.705]  How so, Clyde?
[01:23:32.885 --> 01:23:35.629]  I have this RFID reader I picked up on the internet.
[01:23:35.809 --> 01:23:40.475]  Just by waving it near you, I can skim your credit card information while your cards are still in your purse.
[01:23:40.675 --> 01:23:41.196]  Just watch.
[01:23:41.826 --> 01:23:43.728]  Hey look, that's my info on the screen.
[01:23:43.888 --> 01:23:45.129]  You gotta be kidding me.
[01:23:45.370 --> 01:23:45.610]  Nope.
[01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:49.814]  With 50 million credit cards with hidden RFID chips, I figure we'll make a fortune.
[01:23:50.054 --> 01:23:52.276]  As long as people don't hear about Identity Stronghold.
[01:23:52.477 --> 01:23:52.797]  Why?
[01:23:53.017 --> 01:23:54.779]  What's Identity Stronghold?
[01:23:54.979 --> 01:23:56.320]  They make the Secure Sleeve.
[01:23:56.521 --> 01:24:00.084]  When people keep their credit cards in the shielded Secure Sleeve, I can't read them.
[01:24:00.124 --> 01:24:03.087]  Do a lot of people already know about the Secure Sleeve?
[01:24:03.207 --> 01:24:03.748]  No way.
[01:24:04.048 --> 01:24:07.430]  Most people don't realize they even have chips in their credit cards and passports.
[01:24:07.570 --> 01:24:10.211]  Clyde, we should get some of those secure sleeves.
[01:24:10.351 --> 01:24:11.251]  I already got some.
[01:24:11.452 --> 01:24:13.132]  I also got some to fit our passports.
[01:24:13.352 --> 01:24:18.075]  Identity Stronghold has secure sleeves for sale right on the internet at idstronghold.com.
[01:24:18.335 --> 01:24:19.976]  idstronghold.com?
[01:24:20.196 --> 01:24:20.516]  Right!
[01:24:20.676 --> 01:24:21.676]  Or you can call them at 1-800-610-2770.
[01:24:26.101 --> 01:24:26.862]  Attention please!
[01:24:27.002 --> 01:24:29.445]  I've come with a message of information!
[01:24:29.465 --> 01:24:31.648]  9-11 was an inside job!
[01:24:31.708 --> 01:24:33.229]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:24:33.249 --> 01:24:34.891]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:24:34.951 --> 01:24:37.775]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[01:24:37.795 --> 01:24:41.499]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR...
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:53.624]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th.
[01:24:53.704 --> 01:24:58.712]  George Martin was the co-captain of the New York Giants and laid big blue to a Super Bowl victory.
[01:24:58.812 --> 01:25:04.942]  Today he accomplished another amazing feat, finishing a walk all the way across the country to raise money for the forgotten heroes of 9-11.
[01:25:06.753 --> 01:25:08.575]  Heroes come in all shapes and sizes.
[01:25:08.695 --> 01:25:16.361]  In stature, George Martin is one of the larger ones, but in his mind, he's shadowed by the ones that ran towards the towers that day in September.
[01:25:16.662 --> 01:25:18.663]  And that's why he walks now in June.
[01:25:18.984 --> 01:25:22.106]  To me, the mental part of it was more difficult than the physical aspect of it.
[01:25:22.167 --> 01:25:29.453]  I think because of my athletic ability, it made it a little bit easier, but the mental challenge of doing this repetitively day in and day out, that was the real grind.
[01:25:29.973 --> 01:25:41.743]  3,000 miles, 10 months, 24 pairs of shoes, and 80 sets of socks later, he arrives in San Diego the hard way, via the highway from Manhattan, met by firemen, cops, and his NFL brother.
[01:25:43.940 --> 01:25:47.584]  George endured a lot during his trek, which averaged 22 miles a day.
[01:25:48.024 --> 01:25:54.971]  He dropped 40 pounds, but also raised $2 million for folks with health-related problems linked to 9-11.
[01:25:55.451 --> 01:25:58.754]  A journey, to be sure, of mind, body, and soul.
[01:25:59.054 --> 01:26:05.400]  I want to encourage everyone who is moved by what they're seeing today, or what they're experiencing today, to make their presence known as well.
[01:26:11.997 --> 01:26:12.898]  What a great guy!
[01:26:12.958 --> 01:26:15.179]  Not being self-centered, thinking about other people.
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:19.241]  Walking across the country raising more than two million dollars.
[01:26:20.322 --> 01:26:25.485]  ajourneyfor911.info And it all goes to the first responders.
[01:26:26.066 --> 01:26:31.169]  Two million, two thousand and thirty-one has already been raised.
[01:26:31.189 --> 01:26:39.514]  You can also call 1-800-889-8038 and give for the firemen, the police, the other emergency workers that were there.
[01:26:41.089 --> 01:26:43.590]  Let's go ahead and go to our guest.
[01:26:43.610 --> 01:26:51.394]  A lot of folks already know who he is because they're fans of the Giants or NFL football, George Martin, and of course played with the Giants top player.
[01:26:52.314 --> 01:26:54.515]  Mr. Martin, it is great to have you on with us.
[01:26:55.515 --> 01:26:57.216]  Well, thank you very much, and please call me George.
[01:26:57.936 --> 01:27:03.999]  George, how did you first learn about the plight of the first responders from the deadly dust?
[01:27:04.519 --> 01:27:05.960]  I mean, how did this form in your mind?
[01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:08.301]  How did this end up developing and happening?
[01:27:09.451 --> 01:27:20.597]  Well, first of all, I played all 14 of my NFL seasons right here in New York, and I certainly consider myself a transplanted New Yorker, so the events of 9-11, by and large, took place right here in our backyard.
[01:27:21.237 --> 01:27:30.482]  And when I witness the events and I go back in my mind's eye and I see that catastrophe unfolding, I see the horde just rushing away from that catastrophe.
[01:27:30.902 --> 01:27:36.985]  But I also see a small group of people who are actually running towards it, and that always had a profound impact on me.
[01:27:37.515 --> 01:27:55.141]  And when I found out later that post 9-11 that because of their exposure to the toxic cloud down at Ground Zero, that some of them had become ill and eventually some of them had died, I decided at that point in time to use my celebrity for two distinct purposes.
[01:27:55.741 --> 01:28:00.743]  Number one, to raise the awareness level of the plight of the first responders and rescue and recovery workers.
[01:28:01.263 --> 01:28:03.784]  And secondly, to raise funds for their medical treatment.
[01:28:04.084 --> 01:28:05.805]  And that was the essence of the journey for 9-1-1.
[01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:16.826]  Well, the way that the EPA knew the dust was deadly, they said it was safe to breathe, and then now they've been involved in a huge cover-up.
[01:28:16.846 --> 01:28:30.935]  They gave Christina Todd Whitman liability protection, a court did, and then they still won't give them the health care they need when it's only the cost of four or five smart bombs, you know, just a few hundred million dollars to give them all the treatment they need.
[01:28:31.476 --> 01:28:32.796]  Why won't they give them the treatment?
[01:28:32.816 --> 01:28:33.437]  I don't understand.
[01:28:34.505 --> 01:28:40.790]  Well, it's perplexing to me, particularly when these individuals act, to me, rises to the level of being heroic.
[01:28:41.231 --> 01:28:46.755]  And as you said, they put their very health, their careers, and their very lives on the line here.
[01:28:47.236 --> 01:28:52.400]  Why hasn't America and Americans responded in kind to these brave men and women?
[01:28:52.860 --> 01:29:01.848]  And it's so perplexing to me that I think in many regards it angered me, but not to the point where I would do what most of the government is doing, local and state,
[01:29:02.313 --> 01:29:02.733]  I think so.
[01:29:12.771 --> 01:29:17.054]  This great country of mine, and I have no regrets whatsoever.
[01:29:34.386 --> 01:29:38.428]  Yeah, because $2 million is really just half of the story here.
[01:29:38.488 --> 01:29:56.117]  The bigger story is that with the three participating hospitals that we have that are associated with the Journey for 9-1-1, and they are Mount Sinai, Hackensack University Medical Center, and North Shore Long Island Jewish, each one of those three participating hospitals have pledged that for every dollar we raise,
[01:29:56.587 --> 01:30:01.515]  That they are going to contribute an additional dollar of medical services for these first responders.
[01:30:01.556 --> 01:30:02.457]  Well, that's amazing.
[01:30:02.497 --> 01:30:03.198]  That's amazing.
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:10.050]  In fact, Mount Sinai five years ago did the CAT scans and said they did have a horrible lung disease and still...
[01:30:10.902 --> 01:30:19.370]  I mean, we have to focus on this because, you know, you're doing this great thing to raise two million, now I guess it's over four million, because it's being matched, and that'll certainly help hundreds of these people.
[01:30:19.410 --> 01:30:23.555]  We have over a thousand who've died from this, fifty-something thousand that are sick from it.
[01:30:24.395 --> 01:30:27.438]  I mean, this could all be over overnight.
[01:30:27.479 --> 01:30:34.806]  I mean, have the feds, in all your investigations, said why they won't give any treatment to these people, or why the state's been doing that?
[01:30:35.814 --> 01:30:39.115]  Well, I've not heard any reason, or any good reason, why they have not.
[01:30:39.455 --> 01:30:52.538]  And again, that kind of angers me, because when you look at the cost that we're spending at this war, I mean, you're right, for a fraction of what we're involved in overseas, we could take care of this problem.
[01:30:52.558 --> 01:30:54.418]  I think they can do it in grand fashion.
[01:30:54.898 --> 01:31:03.460]  And I will commend some of the local congressmen, Carolyn Mahoney and some of her colleagues invited me to Washington.
[01:31:03.843 --> 01:31:12.787]  Yes, Dennis Kucinich and Mahoney did that, and we had cameras there, and that's in the film Truth Rising, that comes out July 4th, and you're right, but again, how could it be, and then that Congressman said,
[01:31:24.352 --> 01:31:26.813]  Well, I think what it does is it compounds an already disastrous situation.
[01:31:51.744 --> 01:31:52.125]  I think so.
[01:32:07.150 --> 01:32:09.172]  Well, let's go back to the great work you did.
[01:32:09.232 --> 01:32:13.035]  How did you raise two million plus dollars in this walk across the nation?
[01:32:33.376 --> 01:32:59.964]  Now that's a great question, because when you talk about marshalling resources, and this was really a team effort, there were so many people from the corporate side, from the philanthropist side, and also from the grassroots side, and I'd like to acknowledge some of those individuals, and first of all, there were two outstanding philanthropists here in New York by the name of Joe and Carol Rich, who themselves alone donated and contributed $911,000 for a journey for 9-1-1.
[01:33:02.958 --> 01:33:07.941]  I mean, kudos goes out to those individuals, because that's putting your money where their mouth is.
[01:33:08.402 --> 01:33:32.178]  And then we had such great corporate support, particularly from my company that I work for, AXA Equitable, which is the 14th largest company in the world, who allowed me to go out on this journey for the nine and a half months, who also was our title sponsor, because they marshaled all their resources among their employees, both nationally and locally, and they contributed mightily to this cause.
[01:33:32.771 --> 01:33:41.014]  And of course we had Best Western Hotels, which was the only hotel chain that stepped to the forefront, as that was our greatest expense going across country.
[01:33:41.314 --> 01:33:55.318]  Best Western stood up, as well as Roger Goodell, who's the commissioner of the National Football League, John Mara, who's the owner of the New York Giants, as well as my good friend Gene Upshaw down at the NFL Players Association, all contributed mightily to a journey for 9-1-1.
[01:33:56.297 --> 01:34:26.157]  Well, that's the only way we're going to make the world a better place, and if the Feds won't take our own tax money and help people that are dying, literally, I mean, even fire captains and fire chiefs are dead and dying, who are down there breathing this, and the police and firemen should think about this, and politically think about the fact that this is the type of government you have that won't even give you health care, and a retired NFL player has to go out and walk across the country to try to get a few million dollars
[01:34:27.157 --> 01:34:32.740]  I mean, what's your larger view, not just of the first responders and the tragedy, but just of the entire 9-11 event itself?
[01:34:53.991 --> 01:34:57.574]  Well, first of all, I'd like to say this because I think the ultimate irony is this.
[01:34:57.974 --> 01:35:01.697]  Here it is, we've all come to an agreement that it's not a matter of if.
[01:35:02.477 --> 01:35:06.320]  We know that in the future that there's likely to be another attack on America.
[01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:09.422]  And it's not a matter of if, it's only a matter of when.
[01:35:10.003 --> 01:35:16.608]  I did not want to give those brave men and women who now don the uniform of police, fire and rescue, and EMT
[01:35:17.483 --> 01:35:22.686]  A moment to pause because America would not stand behind them in their time of need.
[01:35:23.046 --> 01:35:31.491]  And I thought it was important for someone to stand fast and say, well, we're going to respond in kind the way these brave men and women have responded to us.
[01:35:32.111 --> 01:35:42.417]  Secondly, when you look at the nation's economy, when you look at how gas prices are just soaring through the roof, when you look at the housing meltdown, when you look at how it's costing more for the cost of living,
[01:35:42.845 --> 01:35:46.188]  And with inflation tacked on to that, here are people who are suffering.
[01:35:46.228 --> 01:35:51.032]  You're talking about Americans who are paying the ultimate price.
[01:35:51.333 --> 01:36:00.921]  It's just inconsolable for me to understand how we have abandoned together as a government to help these people in their gravest, darkest hour.
[01:36:03.584 --> 01:36:04.904]  Well, at least you're stepping up.
[01:36:06.265 --> 01:36:16.108]  Myself and a group called We Are Change in New York, we've raised pittance compared to what you have, about $50,000 for the Feel Good Foundation and a few other groups in New York.
[01:36:16.208 --> 01:36:21.270]  We sent thousands of gas masks and breathing apparatus the day after 9-11.
[01:36:21.290 --> 01:36:24.411]  We could see that concrete and mercury and arsenic and
[01:36:25.531 --> 01:36:31.554]  The asbestos would be bad when the media and the government were saying it was good for them, and then it wasn't a problem.
[01:36:32.254 --> 01:36:51.281]  So, you know, we've tried to do what we could, and again, people have got to ask themselves why they could end the PR nightmare, and they could have given them... I mean, even if the government was evil, the people running it were bad, they could have still taken care of the police and firemen and emergency workers, and then they wouldn't have this big nightmare, this big public relations nightmare.
[01:36:51.341 --> 01:36:52.642]  It just seems like such a
[01:36:53.542 --> 01:36:54.783]  Such a dumb move.
[01:36:54.803 --> 01:37:05.008]  I mean, I would imagine as you were walking for ten months across the country, boy, what a way to see America, that you were probably asking yourself that as you were walking, weren't you?
[01:37:06.028 --> 01:37:06.789]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:37:06.989 --> 01:37:20.916]  And the thing that is ironic to me, it's my understanding that there were funds that were allocated for the first responders and rescue and recovery workers, but it's been held up, I think, because of the perceived litigation that's going to come down the pike, because
[01:37:21.796 --> 01:37:26.360]  People are denied responsibility on the federal level and the state level and the local level.
[01:37:26.380 --> 01:37:29.502]  That's right, you just answered it, and that's the answer to all of it.
[01:37:29.922 --> 01:37:39.830]  If they give them health care when all the hospitals say they're dead and dying and their lungs are full and 20% capacity like you said, if they admit they're sick, then there could be liability, so they're just cutting them loose.
[01:37:41.051 --> 01:37:47.596]  Exactly, and although we realize this is a very litigious society, it should not preclude people from doing what is right.
[01:37:48.012 --> 01:37:54.240]  And it should not preclude the government from stepping up and fulfilling its obligation and its responsibility toward its citizens.
[01:37:54.660 --> 01:37:55.562]  I don't feel that that's right.
[01:37:56.224 --> 01:37:56.744]  Absolutely.
[01:37:56.804 --> 01:38:12.073]  Tell my listeners in closing, sir, in the few minutes we've got left with you, again, we're talking to a famous NFL player, of course, with the Giants, George Martin, who walked across the entire country and raised more than $2 million.
[01:38:12.093 --> 01:38:16.736]  Now it's been doubled up to $4 million for first responders of the 9-11 deadly dust.
[01:38:18.157 --> 01:38:22.221]  I will share with them a quick story that always had a profound impact on me as I was traveling.
[01:38:23.002 --> 01:38:27.506]  We were passed by this van and this grandmother got out of the van with five of her grandchildren.
[01:38:27.526 --> 01:38:28.066]  Four of them were males.
[01:38:43.385 --> 01:38:57.931]  And she lined them up along the road, and she pointed at us as we were walking toward us, and she said, I want my grandchildren to witness a part of history, and I want them to see a real American hero, and I want them to witness the selfless act of giving back to the community.
[01:38:58.311 --> 01:39:02.152]  She then reached in her purse, and she was a lady of very meager means.
[01:39:02.553 --> 01:39:06.174]  She contributed ten of the fourteen dollars that she had in her purse.
[01:39:06.693 --> 01:39:15.616]  And we were so reluctant to take it, but we realized that she was teaching her grandchildren a very valuable lesson that was worth more than the $10 that she had contributed.
[01:39:16.036 --> 01:39:25.259]  So for those individuals within the sound of our listening voice who would like their presence to be known and would like to make a difference in the lives of these heroes, please go to our website, which is
[01:39:27.265 --> 01:39:32.272]  A journey for 9-11.info or go to our toll free number which is 1-800-889-8038.
[01:39:41.326 --> 01:39:42.007]  Absolutely.
[01:39:42.587 --> 01:39:45.169]  And again, people think, oh, you can't save the world by giving.
[01:39:45.189 --> 01:39:51.414]  When you give to good things like this, it certainly does have an effect, and it also helps you because it softens your heart.
[01:39:53.156 --> 01:39:53.936]  What was the route?
[01:39:53.956 --> 01:39:59.301]  I mean, I know you've got a map there, but what was the route that you walked across the nation?
[01:40:00.562 --> 01:40:09.729]  Well, the thing that we wanted to do, because for the time of year we were leaving in the fall, we wanted to walk south so we could avoid any inclement weather coming for us.
[01:40:10.086 --> 01:40:13.487]  So we went as far as we thought was possible.
[01:40:13.527 --> 01:40:20.450]  So we started in New York, went through New Jersey, then Pennsylvania, down through D.C., Delaware, and then to Tennessee.
[01:40:20.470 --> 01:40:21.791]  We walked across Tennessee.
[01:40:22.131 --> 01:40:31.435]  We went across Arkansas into the panhandle of Texas, then New Mexico, on into Arizona, and eventually down into San Diego.
[01:40:31.695 --> 01:40:34.876]  We went through 13 states, including the District of Columbia.
[01:40:35.677 --> 01:40:39.078]  And that was just a marvelous, marvelous excursion.
[01:40:40.075 --> 01:40:46.177]  Our first inclination was safety first, and we did the entire 3,003 miles without any incident whatsoever.
[01:40:46.337 --> 01:40:49.618]  What was it like when you finally reached the sea there in San Diego?
[01:40:49.638 --> 01:40:53.799]  Well, it was a moment of elation, as you could probably understand.
[01:40:54.099 --> 01:40:59.681]  But it was also a period of mixed emotions, because here it is, we had been doing this for nine months.
[01:41:00.301 --> 01:41:02.862]  It was something that we absolutely were thrilled about.
[01:41:03.102 --> 01:41:05.343]  We did not have one single day where we missed
[01:41:05.669 --> 01:41:06.389]  We're good to go.
[01:41:28.743 --> 01:41:30.025]  Well, I'll say this, sir.
[01:41:46.471 --> 01:41:49.833]  It also exposes the fact that they're not getting the treatment they need.
[01:41:49.893 --> 01:42:05.501]  Not only does it get them some of the treatment, it exposes the fact that all over the country, with a lot of local newspapers and TV on the way, getting attention, now national attention, it's just an example of good people standing up and getting involved.
[01:42:06.562 --> 01:42:11.745]  In closing, how did you come up with the idea to do this and then put it into motion?
[01:42:12.765 --> 01:42:19.187]  Well, first, that's a great question, and to begin with, it's a blending of two very distinct passions that I have.
[01:42:19.727 --> 01:42:31.091]  First of all, as a country boy growing up in the outbacks of Greenville, South Carolina, I'd always had this wonderlust inherent in me, and I always wondered what was the larger picture of this great America that we lived in.
[01:42:31.485 --> 01:42:34.727]  Because my exposure was limited to that little farm that I grew up on.
[01:42:35.168 --> 01:42:37.750]  And I always wanted to see this country up close and personal.
[01:42:37.770 --> 01:42:39.491]  I'll tell you what, final segment coming up.
[01:42:40.152 --> 01:42:40.752]  Sir, stay there.
[01:42:40.772 --> 01:42:42.934]  I want to come back and finish up why you decided to do this.
[01:42:43.314 --> 01:42:46.496]  You know, how the idea finally popped into your head and how you did it.
[01:42:46.796 --> 01:42:49.398]  On the other side with our guest, George Martin.
[01:42:49.438 --> 01:42:49.839]  Stay with us.
[01:42:55.180 --> 01:42:58.122]  Imagine walking down the street and hearing footsteps behind you.
[01:42:58.582 --> 01:43:02.685]  They get closer and closer, and suddenly you have a sense something bad is going to happen.
[01:43:03.406 --> 01:43:05.107]  What are you going to do to defend yourself?
[01:43:05.907 --> 01:43:10.010]  Tebowtech specializes in non-lethal self-defense products for you and your family.

[01:45:24.025 --> 01:45:29.689]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?

[01:45:35.013 --> 01:45:39.976]  Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.

[01:46:13.068 --> 01:46:13.868]  Defensive end.
[01:46:16.510 --> 01:46:18.391]  And he's done a good thing.
[01:46:18.431 --> 01:46:20.072]  He's walked all the way across the country.
[01:46:20.752 --> 01:46:21.293]  Raised an alpha.
[01:46:22.313 --> 01:46:25.755]  As a country boy, as I said, I've always had this inherent desire to do so.
[01:46:25.775 --> 01:46:28.496]  But if I ever did it, I wanted to have a cause associated with it.
[01:46:28.556 --> 01:46:31.097]  And it took me and my friends a very short time to come up with
[01:46:48.007 --> 01:46:51.249]  Uh, we think was the most appropriate cause, and that's the journey for 9-11.
[01:46:51.309 --> 01:47:01.814]  And, uh, we are just so delighted to have served as ambassadors for this wonderful cause, and my dad always told me, he said, son, make sure that you leave this world a little bit better than you found it.
[01:47:02.114 --> 01:47:05.576]  And I hope that through those, uh, 3,000 miles, I've attempted to do so.
[01:47:07.113 --> 01:47:15.078]  Well, I think you've done that, and again, thank you for raising the money, getting a medical care, and drawing attention to the huge cover-up of what's happened that is unraveling.
[01:47:15.659 --> 01:47:17.020]  Thanks to people like you, George Martin.
[01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:18.881]  George, thank you, and have a great weekend.
[01:47:19.733 --> 01:47:20.313]  It's my pleasure.
[01:47:20.353 --> 01:47:22.154]  Have a great Fourth of July celebration yourself.
[01:47:22.214 --> 01:47:22.535]  You bet.
[01:47:22.555 --> 01:47:23.015]  Take care.
[01:47:23.035 --> 01:47:27.958]  Yeah, we're going to have a long weekend coming up, but Jason Burmess wants to sit in Thursday.
[01:47:28.538 --> 01:47:30.459]  Tomorrow, Ron Paul is on the show.
[01:47:31.439 --> 01:47:40.004]  Ron Paul, Congressman, talking about the war, what will happen to energy prices if we are engaged in a conflict with Iran.
[01:47:40.364 --> 01:47:43.366]  We have a surprise guest who's joining us for an hour and a half.
[01:47:43.846 --> 01:47:44.647]  That's not Ron Paul.
[01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:48.805]  Big guest after big guest after big guest tomorrow.
[01:47:49.707 --> 01:47:54.414]  Truth Rising comes out in 24 hours and I'll just let my listeners know.
[01:47:55.716 --> 01:47:57.579]  It'll be out Thursday night.
[01:47:58.404 --> 01:48:06.446]  You know, we said officially that it comes out July 4th, but in case there's ever a server snafu, we got two CDNs and a bunch of backup servers.
[01:48:07.146 --> 01:48:11.647]  I like to start it a little early, knowing that only a fraction of our audience is tuned in at any one time.
[01:48:12.047 --> 01:48:22.590]  So for the few of you listening now, compared to the huge millions that tune in every week, tomorrow afternoon, I'll just say that, start looking for it to be up in a bunch of different formats at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:48:24.907 --> 01:48:29.596]  And again, I want you to make copies of the film, digital copies, DVD copies.
[01:48:29.696 --> 01:48:31.359]  Order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:48:32.915 --> 01:48:36.257]  Today, it'll be shipping out Saturday and Monday to you.
[01:48:36.597 --> 01:48:42.660]  So, for all intents and purposes, it's no longer pre-ordering at InfoWars.com or get your PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:44.621]  See all of my other 18 films.
[01:48:44.661 --> 01:48:47.362]  This will be my 19th film.

[01:48:48.863 --> 01:48:53.545]  These live streams we do, like we're doing now, are also posted for all the members every day.
[01:48:53.965 --> 01:48:56.306]  And they cut them up and do a lot of stuff with them and put them all over the web.
[01:48:56.346 --> 01:48:57.487]  We appreciate folks doing that.
[01:48:58.820 --> 01:49:03.223]  Because the goal is to get the word out, but your financial support is also needed.
[01:49:03.623 --> 01:49:05.925]  So again, get Truth Rising, get Endgame.
[01:49:06.225 --> 01:49:11.348]  We have a discount of a Tex Marsh new book, the sequel to Codex Magicka, and I think it's even better, folks.
[01:49:11.388 --> 01:49:13.790]  His new book is just unbelievable.
[01:49:13.830 --> 01:49:14.450]  Go check it out.

[01:49:24.113 --> 01:49:29.059]  And the retransmission starts now at InfoWars.com for any of the big guests and important information that we had on today.
[01:49:38.570 --> 01:49:45.432]  The show's over, but in the satellite it's over until tonight, 9 to midnight, where it's all rebroadcast on shortwave satellite, the AM and FM dial.
[01:49:46.352 --> 01:49:52.014]  But you'll be able to tune into the restream at InfoWars.com if you missed any of the first few hours.
