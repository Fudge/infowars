[00:00:05.606 --> 00:00:06.267]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.907 --> 00:00:07.988]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.688 --> 00:00:09.769]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:11.290]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:12.951]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.971 --> 00:00:17.395]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.775 --> 00:00:21.838]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.096 --> 00:00:43.337]  All right, Ron Paul and crew are on an airplane right now.
[00:00:43.357 --> 00:00:45.217]  We just talked to the head of the campaign, Ken Schneider.
[00:00:45.717 --> 00:00:51.299]  Ron Paul is scheduled to come on sometime in the third hour.
[00:00:52.612 --> 00:00:53.012]  Okay?
[00:00:53.473 --> 00:00:56.315]  Barring if they can get out of the airport and get to their hotel room.
[00:00:56.795 --> 00:00:57.796]  So he's scheduled.
[00:00:57.976 --> 00:01:03.100]  Rand Paul, Dr. Paul's son, is confirmed coming up for a report in the second hour.
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:10.345]  Looks like we're going to have Kent Schneider popping in as well with the Ron Paul 2008 campaign.
[00:01:10.886 --> 00:01:16.610]  But more importantly, we're going to have wide open phones today to not just talk about the Republican campaign,
[00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:18.791]  We're good to go.
[00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:19.371]  We're good to go.
[00:01:32.512 --> 00:01:34.793]  We can get your take on it at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:34.873 --> 00:01:35.273]  It is Friday.
[00:01:35.293 --> 00:01:35.893]  We're already well into 2008.
[00:01:35.973 --> 00:01:37.714]  Already Friday, the fourth day of January 2008.
[00:01:37.934 --> 00:01:39.414]  Again, that's taking some time.
[00:01:54.463 --> 00:01:55.323]  Getting used to.
[00:01:55.583 --> 00:02:00.664]  RonPaulWarRoom.com is a blog site you can post right on the main page.
[00:02:01.245 --> 00:02:07.246]  We're also going to have your own personal account soon where you can have your own area and your own blog separate where all your comments are together.
[00:02:07.946 --> 00:02:11.047]  You can also comment in sections on other people's comments.
[00:02:11.827 --> 00:02:17.308]  And I've gotten a lot of emails, I mean the majority like it, but some saying, why is it called a war room?
[00:02:17.788 --> 00:02:19.128]  Ron Paul's against war.
[00:02:19.148 --> 00:02:21.569]  If you go to the major dictionaries...
[00:02:22.937 --> 00:02:30.124]  War Room, it says, is a command center where military or political decisions are made.
[00:02:31.225 --> 00:02:35.989]  The famous documentary about the Clinton campaign in 1993 is called War Room on PBS.
[00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.193]  It's the term for a campaign nexus center.
[00:02:41.304 --> 00:02:53.009]  And, you know, myself and my writers and my researchers are smart guys and gals, but we can't do what you, the open source intelligence, can, what you, millions of listeners, can do.
[00:02:54.169 --> 00:03:04.254]  And the leads we're getting, the info we're getting, the thousands of posts, and people that have already signed up at ronpaulwarroom.com, that's why it's called a war room.
[00:03:04.274 --> 00:03:05.294]  And I know most of you get this.
[00:03:05.334 --> 00:03:05.894]  Some don't.
[00:03:06.114 --> 00:03:07.355]  They're like, but Ron Paul's against war.
[00:03:07.875 --> 00:03:08.975]  Why is it called a money bomb?
[00:03:08.996 --> 00:03:10.036]  Why is it called an info war?
[00:03:11.012 --> 00:03:16.196]  Why is it called the Ron Paul Air Force or Air Corps?
[00:03:17.357 --> 00:03:18.698]  This is all going on.
[00:03:19.458 --> 00:03:22.340]  This is all happening because that's what campaigns are.
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.102]  That's why an advertising campaign is called a campaign.
[00:03:25.322 --> 00:03:30.186]  That's from the Roman term for military operation, invasion.
[00:03:31.747 --> 00:03:34.769]  It's the same thing with political campaigns.
[00:03:35.706 --> 00:03:37.908]  That's why they call them dark horse candidates.
[00:03:37.928 --> 00:03:40.589]  It's all deals with cavalry and infantry.
[00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.613]  We take our violent military tendencies and we put them into the political process.
[00:03:46.633 --> 00:03:49.736]  It's like football is simulated combat.
[00:03:50.256 --> 00:03:59.822]  So I'm sorry that this was lost on some of the more mainline liberals who are in the Ron Paul camp.
[00:03:59.842 --> 00:04:00.423]  You're welcome.
[00:04:01.287 --> 00:04:05.250]  It's just that RonPaulWarRoom.com is because it's what we said it was.
[00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:11.415]  It's a place to discuss political ideas, uncensored, not just about Ron Paul, but about every issue.
[00:04:12.075 --> 00:04:12.716]  Uncensored.
[00:04:13.436 --> 00:04:13.816]  Okay?
[00:04:15.017 --> 00:04:16.819]  There's people in there savaging me.
[00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:17.439]  I love it.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.582]  Though I don't have as much time as I used to to enjoy the attacks.
[00:04:22.783 --> 00:04:25.185]  That's what it's all about, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:26.766]  So I wanted to make...
[00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:28.490]  That clear.
[00:04:29.131 --> 00:04:31.853]  Also, we've got news on the Ron Paul Air Corps.
[00:04:32.454 --> 00:04:38.099]  They haven't updated it since yesterday afternoon, but it's well over $20,000 that has been raised there.
[00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:38.680]  So good job.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.961]  That'll fund quite a few flights.
[00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:41.943]  Let's fund some more around the nation.
[00:04:42.183 --> 00:04:48.229]  But hey, you tune in to get my comment, my analysis, my view on what has happened here.
[00:04:49.954 --> 00:04:55.220]  With the Iowa situation, the good, the bad, and the ugly, I'll tell you what I think and break it down on the other side.
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.581]  Then we'll start taking your calls.
[00:04:56.601 --> 00:04:58.403]  We've got a lot of Big Brother news as well.
[00:04:58.443 --> 00:04:58.904]  Stay with me.
[00:05:01.434 --> 00:05:09.356]  For years, you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained the leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[00:05:09.816 --> 00:05:12.957]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?

[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.082]  A new world order.
[00:06:05.822 --> 00:06:10.985]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:06:11.025 --> 00:06:12.786]  It's known as the Builder Bird Group.
[00:06:13.507 --> 00:06:15.768]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:18.750]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:26.794]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:06:29.815 --> 00:06:34.798]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:38.761]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:06:39.141 --> 00:06:41.663]  Bill Vargas is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:06:41.703 --> 00:06:42.684]  Most people have no idea.
[00:06:42.704 --> 00:06:43.644]  They're not after money.
[00:06:43.664 --> 00:06:44.725]  They have all the money they need.
[00:06:44.945 --> 00:06:45.666]  They're after power.
[00:06:45.926 --> 00:06:46.586]  That's what happens.
[00:06:47.067 --> 00:06:55.272]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or Infowars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:55.452 --> 00:06:58.394]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:06:58.594 --> 00:06:59.615]  You have been warned.
[00:07:00.476 --> 00:07:01.137]  It's a fact.
[00:07:01.357 --> 00:07:08.825]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:07:08.966 --> 00:07:15.333]  With never ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all
[00:07:15.333 --> 00:07:16.074]  We're good to go.
[00:07:35.174 --> 00:07:37.075]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[00:07:37.095 --> 00:07:37.635]  Visit FDRS.org today.
[00:08:01.101 --> 00:08:06.165]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.505 --> 00:08:08.787]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:11.796 --> 00:08:18.884]  In six hours yesterday at ronpaulaircord.com...
[00:08:31.954 --> 00:08:33.315]  More than 20 grand came in.
[00:08:33.355 --> 00:08:35.696]  I'm told under 10 or 15 has come in since then.
[00:08:36.057 --> 00:08:37.618]  They've got to update the site, though.
[00:08:38.058 --> 00:08:41.320]  I talked to the folks looking at the PayPal and the chip in and the rest of it.
[00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:43.321]  Very exciting, listeners.
[00:08:43.381 --> 00:08:44.282]  I'm so proud of you.
[00:08:44.302 --> 00:08:46.403]  We're going to get aircraft up all over the place.
[00:08:47.144 --> 00:08:48.725]  And don't wait for orders from headquarters.
[00:08:49.655 --> 00:08:55.901]  You need to call your own advertising places in your area and you can even have them get up now with simple banners.
[00:08:55.941 --> 00:09:00.285]  We've had big fancy $3,500 ones made that are huge.
[00:09:00.785 --> 00:09:04.609]  One of them was so big after two hours flight it broke off the helicopter but they got it back.
[00:09:05.449 --> 00:09:07.231]  So just don't wait for orders from headquarters.
[00:09:07.511 --> 00:09:09.293]  Go absolutely crazy right now.
[00:09:09.373 --> 00:09:10.374]  Give money to the blimp.
[00:09:11.054 --> 00:09:14.457]  All of it, but we're doing our separate deal over at ronpaulaircourse.com.
[00:09:14.477 --> 00:09:20.040]  We've also launched ronpaulwarroom.com, open source blog for no censorship.
[00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.303]  Post whatever you want, what your ideas are, what's going on.
[00:09:23.703 --> 00:09:27.846]  He'll only be with us for about five minutes because he's driving cross-country and his cell phone may cut out.
[00:09:28.186 --> 00:09:37.092]  Kent Snyder, head of the Ron Paul 2008 campaign, to give us his analysis from the front lines of what happened in the Iowa caucus last night.
[00:09:37.332 --> 00:09:38.193]  Kent, thanks for coming on.
[00:09:38.713 --> 00:09:39.093]  Yeah, sure.
[00:09:39.133 --> 00:09:39.553]  Good morning.
[00:09:39.573 --> 00:09:40.394]  Glad to be with you.
[00:09:40.814 --> 00:09:41.594]  Absolutely, sir.
[00:09:41.654 --> 00:09:42.414]  You've got the floor.
[00:09:42.454 --> 00:09:42.914]  Five minutes.
[00:09:42.954 --> 00:09:43.614]  Tell us what happened.
[00:09:44.155 --> 00:09:46.495]  Well, we got 10% of the vote.
[00:09:47.095 --> 00:09:52.697]  We beat Rudy Giuliani, which I think most people know about, which is quite satisfying for several reasons.
[00:09:53.237 --> 00:09:56.578]  I would like your listeners to simply know that this is the beginning.
[00:09:56.598 --> 00:09:59.739]  I mean, I met him back to the airport to go to New Hampshire.
[00:09:59.759 --> 00:10:05.941]  Dr. Paul left early this morning to do an interview with Bill Moyers out of New York, and then he'll be on in New Hampshire this afternoon.
[00:10:06.502 --> 00:10:08.743]  So, you know, we had a lot of work here.
[00:10:09.304 --> 00:10:15.587]  Keep in mind also that, Dr. Paul, when we started this whole enterprise in Iowa, was it zero to 1% on all poles?
[00:10:16.208 --> 00:10:18.069]  And so we've made substantial progress.
[00:10:18.149 --> 00:10:25.233]  I mean, people have to understand this, and I have to remind myself as well, that it's always harder to go from zero to 10 than it is to go from 10 to 20.
[00:10:25.433 --> 00:10:26.713]  It's like the space shuttle.
[00:10:27.094 --> 00:10:30.536]  It uses, what, 80, 90% of its fuel just to get out of the atmosphere.
[00:10:30.596 --> 00:10:32.437]  So it's the same thing here.
[00:10:33.097 --> 00:10:34.738]  The supporters are enthusiastic.
[00:10:35.311 --> 00:10:36.672]  They're tired, I can tell you that.
[00:10:36.772 --> 00:10:42.657]  It's just amazing the number of people, especially the students, that came in from all across the country.
[00:10:42.717 --> 00:10:45.500]  So the enthusiasm is still there.
[00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:46.341]  People are tired.
[00:10:46.901 --> 00:10:47.762]  It's just the beginning.
[00:10:48.723 --> 00:10:50.484]  We're expecting good things in New Hampshire.
[00:10:50.504 --> 00:10:52.786]  We're expecting very good things in South Carolina.
[00:10:53.507 --> 00:10:54.708]  So it's not going to be easy.
[00:10:54.768 --> 00:10:58.071]  It is a bit of a marathon, and Dr. Paul knows it.
[00:10:58.271 --> 00:10:58.711]  We know it.
[00:10:59.151 --> 00:11:00.793]  Our supporters need to keep that in mind.
[00:11:01.523 --> 00:11:05.007]  We've got a long ways to go, but we're going the distance.
[00:11:05.027 --> 00:11:08.111]  So that's just exactly how we look at it.
[00:11:09.429 --> 00:11:12.912]  Well, it's completely obvious, according to Fox's own statements.
[00:11:13.052 --> 00:11:17.335]  Last Saturday, they said, yeah, Ron Paul is not in the debate.
[00:11:17.435 --> 00:11:18.976]  He's not a top-tier candidate.
[00:11:19.016 --> 00:11:23.740]  They said, we're only having five, the top five, and they said, those are top-tier.
[00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:29.244]  Whoever is in one through fifth place, he got fifth place, almost got fourth place.
[00:11:29.685 --> 00:11:32.707]  So they've got Giuliani, who got less than half the votes...
[00:11:33.187 --> 00:11:36.588]  Oh, there's no doubt about that, and there's already buzz about that, Alex.
[00:11:36.608 --> 00:11:43.351]  I'm glad you brought that up, because, you know, the polls that matter are votes, not opinion polls or anything else, but votes.
[00:11:57.461 --> 00:12:04.404]  And Dr. Paul, as you just mentioned, he is just a couple points away from beating John McCain and beating Fred Thompson.
[00:12:04.824 --> 00:12:07.425]  He beat Rudy hands down.
[00:12:07.465 --> 00:12:09.446]  Even out of the L.A.
[00:12:09.486 --> 00:12:13.308]  Times this morning, some columnists were talking about that.
[00:12:13.368 --> 00:12:16.849]  So it's going to be interesting to see if Fox changes their mind.
[00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:20.451]  I don't know that they will, but it will be interesting to see that.
[00:12:21.331 --> 00:12:25.253]  And we actually have a separate production that we're putting together at the last minute
[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:31.723]  For people to be able to hear more from Dr. Paul, but we're hoping that Fox changes his mind, but I don't know if they will.
[00:12:32.063 --> 00:12:36.145]  Well, I know that you were in the thick of a battle there, so you see it up close.
[00:12:36.205 --> 00:12:38.266]  We see it kind of from the big picture.
[00:12:38.586 --> 00:12:51.472]  I know you've got that picture in the war room as well, but three different Fox pundits this morning have come out and said that they think he should be included, and those people are all on short leashes there.
[00:12:51.752 --> 00:12:54.834]  I think that's the first sign that Fox is about to capitulate.
[00:12:56.021 --> 00:13:10.227]  I've been hearing a little bit of that and that's encouraging and maybe what they're doing is they're setting themselves up to make a change of plan and say well Dr. Paul did get 10% in the caucus yesterday so based on that they'll go ahead and invite him in.
[00:13:10.327 --> 00:13:12.728]  We're certainly hoping that that will be the case.
[00:13:12.808 --> 00:13:21.832]  It certainly should be the case without question because the effort that was made and the voters expressed their support for Dr. Paul and you know
[00:13:22.637 --> 00:13:29.300]  I just think that his results are going to be even better in New Hampshire, so he certainly should be there.
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.601]  What about ABC News?
[00:13:31.641 --> 00:13:36.643]  They were saying that if you didn't get double digits, that you wouldn't be involved.
[00:13:36.663 --> 00:13:49.029]  They said this Monday in a release and statements, and they said that they would only take the top five, so I think they've boxed themselves in because now they're going to have to put Ron Paul in that final ABC forum.
[00:13:49.821 --> 00:13:50.742]  Yes, yeah, that's right.
[00:13:50.802 --> 00:13:58.828]  I mean, we're scheduled to be in that one, what, just the day before, or two days before, whatever it is, the New Hampshire primary.
[00:13:58.888 --> 00:14:06.534]  So, you know, a 10% take there in Iowa, and again, just a point or two behind McCain and Thompson.
[00:14:06.874 --> 00:14:13.239]  You put those two items together, and Dr. Paul should be featured at any debate or any forum that anybody has.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:18.609]  Kent, I know you're driving down the road, and when you get where you're going, or if somebody calls you and you need to go, just drop off.
[00:14:18.629 --> 00:14:21.214]  But if you're just driving, I'll keep you a few more minutes.
[00:14:21.475 --> 00:14:22.016]  It's your call.
[00:14:22.685 --> 00:14:23.206]  Go ahead.
[00:14:23.746 --> 00:14:26.629]  Okay, and obviously Ron Paul's on a plane.
[00:14:26.769 --> 00:14:27.489]  I talked to you earlier.
[00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:29.691]  He is supposedly going to be on today.
[00:14:29.711 --> 00:14:34.516]  I hope he gets off that plane on time to be here, popping in in the third hour, Kent.
[00:14:35.076 --> 00:14:40.081]  But expanding into this, that's not just hype or hyperbole.
[00:14:40.341 --> 00:14:43.784]  When you say that the space shuttle or a Titan rocket...
[00:14:45.685 --> 00:14:52.187]  He uses 80, 90% of its fuel, just getting a few thousand feet in the air, just getting off the launch pad in many cases.
[00:14:52.227 --> 00:15:02.690]  The fact that in a year he's come from nobody knowing him, really, except for this audience, to now being a household word all over Europe, globally.
[00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:05.491]  I mean, I guess a prophet isn't known in his own country.
[00:15:05.511 --> 00:15:08.192]  He's even bigger overseas now, growing exponentially.
[00:15:08.212 --> 00:15:12.193]  If you look at that trajectory, if you guys just had another month or two, there's...
[00:15:13.033 --> 00:15:17.676]  I mean, look at how Giuliani went from being the front to being the back, and now Ron Paul is in the middle.
[00:15:18.016 --> 00:15:28.822]  And that's even in Iowa, where they... I mean, let's face it, and I'm not bashing Mormons here, but the right-wing Christian conservatives came in for Huckabee because they don't want a Mormon.
[00:15:29.323 --> 00:15:31.064]  I mean, that's just the bottom line here.
[00:15:31.284 --> 00:15:35.306]  And as you said, we talked a few days ago, you said he'd do a lot better in New Hampshire.
[00:15:35.606 --> 00:15:36.627]  All the polls show that.
[00:15:36.887 --> 00:15:40.089]  Even mainstream news is saying he could win or come in second or third.
[00:15:40.109 --> 00:15:40.509]  Right.
[00:15:40.969 --> 00:15:44.733]  I mean, that's a big comment I just stated, but just comments on what I just said.
[00:15:45.493 --> 00:15:51.238]  Yeah, well, again, I think we all need to see things for what they were and see things for what they are.
[00:15:51.298 --> 00:15:56.403]  And that is, again, where Dr. Paul started, you know, a year ago with zero to one percent nationwide.
[00:15:56.763 --> 00:15:58.464]  Certainly that was the case here in Iowa.
[00:15:59.205 --> 00:16:00.386]  It was a roll of the dice.
[00:16:00.446 --> 00:16:02.568]  I mean, it was a very tough project to get started.
[00:16:02.967 --> 00:16:10.810]  But I think the supporters and the donors around the country need to take stock that this is where we started.
[00:16:11.771 --> 00:16:20.314]  Sure, it's been a year, but this is a very big country, and a year is not very much time to get somebody as a household word, as you mentioned.
[00:16:20.375 --> 00:16:23.236]  So we need to take some satisfaction in that.
[00:16:23.476 --> 00:16:30.639]  Yes, we still have a long way to go, but I would rather be in the trajectory where we are, obviously, than be in Rudy's ship,
[00:16:31.421 --> 00:16:31.802]  Any day.
[00:16:32.423 --> 00:16:33.404]  We're in a good position.
[00:16:33.945 --> 00:16:39.973]  The people in New Hampshire already know that they're going to have to perform and get the vote out, and various other states as well.
[00:16:40.373 --> 00:16:49.365]  So we have a lot of work to do, but we've come a long way, and I think people need to take some stock of that and be proud of that and be encouraged by it as well.
[00:16:50.376 --> 00:17:17.695]  Absolutely, and to use the space analogy, Rudolph Giuliani has fallen out of the sky, and Ron Paul has left orbit, and if it took six months to get 1% in the polls, and then eight months in, he got 3% in the polls, and then 10 months in, he got 5% in the polls, and now we're 12 months into this embryonic campaign, and he's at 10%, 15%, depending on which poll, and those are traditional people that are being polled,
[00:17:18.935 --> 00:17:25.597]  I mean, the trajectory here, I mean, how do you see this breaking down, Ken Snyder, predictions?
[00:17:26.558 --> 00:17:29.659]  Well, I mean, I think we will do well in New Hampshire.
[00:17:29.699 --> 00:17:30.239]  I really do.
[00:17:30.299 --> 00:17:33.660]  I think in terms of what placement is, I'm not quite settled yet.
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.521]  I'm a little bit tired to think about it too much.
[00:17:36.181 --> 00:17:38.041]  I'm very optimistic about New Hampshire.
[00:17:38.121 --> 00:17:42.663]  I'm extremely optimistic about South Carolina, and I'm very optimistic about Nevada.
[00:17:43.123 --> 00:17:46.404]  So, I mean, we knew that Iowa would probably be our toughest test,
[00:17:47.149 --> 00:17:48.610]  Going into it, we understood that.
[00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:49.510]  We had to compete.
[00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:53.993]  We wanted to compete, and we're very glad that we did compete in Iowa.
[00:17:54.313 --> 00:18:03.058]  But we knew from day one, we said it six months ago, that Iowa would not be our most promising state, but we had to compete here, and we're glad that we did.
[00:18:03.498 --> 00:18:12.223]  But for us, the Ron Paul message, the campaign, Dr. Paul himself, our best states are right around the corner, and that's New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada.
[00:18:12.699 --> 00:18:22.249]  And I can guarantee you when we do well in those three states, the conversation, the topics, the discussion by the mainstream media, they'll be talking a different tune.
[00:18:22.269 --> 00:18:23.270]  I can guarantee you that.
[00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:26.693]  Well, I don't want to talk about ancient history, but so listeners can understand this.
[00:18:27.394 --> 00:18:33.160]  Everybody knows who's into politics and really studies it, and you're an expert, that Iowa's a weird country.
[00:18:34.036 --> 00:18:36.477]  Well, it's just the caucus system itself.
[00:18:36.517 --> 00:18:40.439]  I mean, a lot of people argue we've been following this for a long time.
[00:18:40.499 --> 00:18:41.539]  It's outdated.
[00:18:41.599 --> 00:18:50.463]  People are now speculating that this will really be the last time that this Iowa presidential caucus will happen as it did yesterday.
[00:19:02.949 --> 00:19:04.152]  For a variety of reasons.
[00:19:04.212 --> 00:19:10.964]  So it's just somewhat archaic and I think it will probably change on the next go-around.
[00:19:11.025 --> 00:19:11.405]  So it's...
[00:19:11.983 --> 00:19:14.105]  It's just one of those things that's very unique.
[00:19:14.465 --> 00:19:18.469]  Some people like it, but I think a growing number of people do not.

[00:19:30.279 --> 00:19:31.500]  And the good thing about being tired is...
[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:32.801]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:32.821 --> 00:19:33.901]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:01.696 --> 00:20:05.597]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:20:05.818 --> 00:20:18.102]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:20:18.522 --> 00:20:18.922]  The U.S.
[00:20:18.962 --> 00:20:24.544]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:20:24.945 --> 00:20:27.145]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:20:29.026 --> 00:20:30.086]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[00:20:30.106 --> 00:20:32.947]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[00:20:33.067 --> 00:20:39.089]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.

[00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:04.641]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:21:05.261 --> 00:21:14.183]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:21:14.643 --> 00:21:21.825]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?

[00:22:59.056 --> 00:23:01.618]  Hi, neighbor.
[00:23:02.218 --> 00:23:03.900]  The world famine is in its third year.
[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:06.422]  Our harvest is too small to get through the year.
[00:23:07.022 --> 00:23:13.847]  Genetically poisoned food, dangerous food imports, and constantly recalled disease-contaminated foods are mixed in with our safe food.
[00:23:14.708 --> 00:23:17.490]  Farm food production is turned into ethanol fuel.
[00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:18.811]  What should I do?
[00:23:19.331 --> 00:23:22.013]  How long can I afford food or till there's no food?
[00:23:22.614 --> 00:23:24.035]  How long before it's all poisoned?
[00:23:24.662 --> 00:23:26.925]  Will three years worth of food supply be enough?
[00:23:27.385 --> 00:23:30.809]  Or will it only postpone my trip to the population control bread line?
[00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:33.372]  Will it be okay to wait till after the holidays?
[00:23:33.812 --> 00:23:37.797]  I'll use what I didn't spend on Christmas for a something is better than nothing supply.
[00:23:38.277 --> 00:23:39.158]  I'll get the rest later.
[00:23:39.178 --> 00:23:40.480]  How long do I dare wait?
[00:23:41.215 --> 00:23:42.756]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[00:23:42.796 --> 00:23:44.417]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[00:24:39.302 --> 00:24:42.023]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:42.043 --> 00:24:43.123]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:24:43.243 --> 00:24:43.643]  Oh, yeah.
[00:24:43.703 --> 00:24:45.023]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:24:45.203 --> 00:24:47.864]  I don't care if you're a hillbilly renegade.
[00:25:09.381 --> 00:25:10.822]  I don't care if you're a renegade or a funk.
[00:25:14.165 --> 00:25:18.488]  All I care about is that you want liberty and you want me to have liberty and I want to make sure you got it.
[00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:22.911]  We can hang out with who we want.
[00:25:22.931 --> 00:25:24.192]  We can do business with who we want.
[00:25:24.212 --> 00:25:27.655]  We can live our lives like we see fit as long as we don't hurt anybody else.
[00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:33.012]  That's what it's all about, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:25:42.077 --> 00:25:42.737]  to 1 a.m.
[00:25:43.497 --> 00:25:44.218]  Mountain.
[00:25:45.398 --> 00:25:49.240]  We are honored to be here with you today.
[00:25:49.261 --> 00:25:50.241]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:25:50.501 --> 00:25:52.822]  I will be taking your calls in the next segment.
[00:25:52.862 --> 00:25:56.324]  Look, I'm going to analyze the Ron Paul situation.
[00:25:56.344 --> 00:25:58.966]  Remember yesterday I said I was going to make a bunch of predictions?
[00:25:59.738 --> 00:26:01.980]  And then I got busy with guests and callers and really didn't.
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:07.544]  But I did say on air that I thought he would get fourth or fifth place in New Hampshire.
[00:26:07.564 --> 00:26:09.166]  It wasn't hard to predict that.
[00:26:10.347 --> 00:26:20.575]  And what you've got is, you've got the, quote, Christian right, who predominantly are for gun control, open borders, they're for anything, as long as you say you're going to kill Muslims.
[00:26:22.096 --> 00:26:24.618]  In fact, Pat Robertson literally said when he endorsed Giuliani,
[00:26:25.345 --> 00:26:30.387]  He said, hey, the abortion issue, the gay marriage, that isn't as important as fighting Al-Qaeda.
[00:26:30.887 --> 00:26:31.307]  Let me see.
[00:26:31.407 --> 00:26:35.769]  Even if you believe Al-Qaeda is real and killed 3,000 people on 9-11, is that 50 million babies?
[00:26:37.069 --> 00:26:45.992]  I mean, again, terrorists, even if they're real, are as rare as a leprechaun or a... I mean, it's like being in the forest and seeing a unicorn.
[00:26:47.092 --> 00:26:48.093]  I mean, I want to see one.
[00:26:48.113 --> 00:26:54.615]  The only terrorists I see are wearing black uniforms and going around terrorizing the public.
[00:26:55.089 --> 00:26:57.651]  And I'm not saying all police, but the training is going in that direction.
[00:26:57.871 --> 00:26:59.112]  The system certainly wants that.
[00:27:01.834 --> 00:27:03.875]  And there are, you know, people terrorizing folks.
[00:27:03.935 --> 00:27:04.736]  It's called crime.
[00:27:05.316 --> 00:27:06.237]  They're out there as well.
[00:27:08.658 --> 00:27:09.719]  But that's the history of the world.
[00:27:09.759 --> 00:27:16.404]  You hire somebody to protect you from the criminals, and of course they become the criminals nine times out of ten.
[00:27:16.684 --> 00:27:21.487]  We also have some surprise guests, it looks like, lined up later in the show today.
[00:27:21.587 --> 00:27:22.488]  You'll see who that is.
[00:27:23.431 --> 00:27:24.892]  If that indeed materializes.
[00:27:24.952 --> 00:27:26.233]  Again, Ron Paul is scheduled.
[00:27:26.874 --> 00:27:28.135]  Their plane took off late.
[00:27:29.276 --> 00:27:52.354]  And, you know, frankly, if PBS suddenly calls and says, we want you on Lair News Hour, and then they've got to take a later flight, and so they move from 1130 to 130 on the show, and then the flight they rescheduled to takes off late, and then they don't get to their hotel in New Hampshire, and Ron Paul has to fight through mobs and reporters and people.
[00:27:53.024 --> 00:27:56.966]  He may not be here, but they say, Dr. Snyder, now he's scheduled in third hour.
[00:27:57.286 --> 00:27:57.926]  We'll see what happens.
[00:27:57.966 --> 00:27:58.786]  I'm not too worried about it.
[00:27:58.846 --> 00:27:59.927]  He'll be on Sunday or Monday.
[00:27:59.947 --> 00:28:00.567]  You know it'll be here.
[00:28:00.587 --> 00:28:01.127]  He's always here.
[00:28:01.447 --> 00:28:03.868]  Because right now, this is a unique time we're all in.
[00:28:04.348 --> 00:28:08.390]  But we do have Rand Paul popping in, and we do have another surprise Ron Paul guest and other things.
[00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:11.431]  So that is what's coming up.
[00:28:11.451 --> 00:28:15.252]  All right, on the situation of Ron Paul.
[00:28:16.233 --> 00:28:17.653]  I don't say this as a pep talk.
[00:28:17.993 --> 00:28:18.674]  I don't say this...
[00:28:20.751 --> 00:28:22.012]  You know, just to make you feel good, it's the truth.
[00:28:22.372 --> 00:28:31.860]  They bust in the church ladies who normally have, you know, their twinkle toes, you know, the type, limp-roasted preachers, that whole guild that runs things.
[00:28:33.421 --> 00:28:34.662]  And it's a club.
[00:28:34.682 --> 00:28:35.423]  You've got to be part of it.
[00:28:36.163 --> 00:28:39.986]  And they, you can really look at Huckabee and tell you that's a twinkle toes right there.
[00:28:40.026 --> 00:28:42.248]  But hey, you know, he's their own twinkle toes.
[00:28:42.368 --> 00:28:43.249]  You know, he's a fake.
[00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:44.610]  Someone who, like,
[00:28:45.422 --> 00:28:48.564]  I mean, he's somebody who's obsessed with goods, by the way.
[00:28:48.985 --> 00:28:49.705]  He even admits it.
[00:28:50.166 --> 00:28:54.288]  He just is constantly fondling his Blackberry and fondling his guitar.
[00:28:54.929 --> 00:28:59.332]  He just has whole rooms full of crap, and he begs people for gifts.
[00:28:59.672 --> 00:29:05.116]  I mean, me, I hate junk and piles of Christmas goods and opening packages.
[00:29:05.176 --> 00:29:05.616]  I'm just like, ugh.
[00:29:05.937 --> 00:29:07.758]  I mean, I like a nice automobile.
[00:29:08.759 --> 00:29:09.779]  I like things of quality.
[00:29:09.799 --> 00:29:12.341]  I like a nice leather jacket when it's cold.
[00:29:12.421 --> 00:29:14.743]  I like pants, Levi's that fit well.
[00:29:16.054 --> 00:29:17.595]  I like having comfortable shoes.
[00:29:18.996 --> 00:29:20.997]  But money is just something to get my teeth cleaned.
[00:29:21.197 --> 00:29:22.558]  Or put gas in my car.
[00:29:22.818 --> 00:29:28.962]  Or, you know, maybe live in a house that's in a neighborhood that's got a gate on it so I don't get harassed.
[00:29:30.182 --> 00:29:31.563]  But it's not like I just worship it.
[00:29:32.064 --> 00:29:33.504]  Oh, money.
[00:29:33.945 --> 00:29:35.245]  Give me goodies.
[00:29:35.706 --> 00:29:36.946]  Like Amelgo Marcus.
[00:29:37.207 --> 00:29:41.889]  She just had like tens of thousands of pairs of shoes and just would shop ten hours a day.
[00:29:41.949 --> 00:29:42.770]  What a nightmare.
[00:29:43.331 --> 00:29:46.775]  All right, I'll get into Ron Paul and we'll get back.
[00:29:51.681 --> 00:29:52.602]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.062 --> 00:29:54.664]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.605 --> 00:29:58.309]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.411 --> 00:30:01.891]  Hi, Ken.
[00:30:01.951 --> 00:30:02.711]  It's Judy again.
[00:30:02.731 --> 00:30:07.273]  I just wanted to call you back and let you know how thankful Mike and I are for your working with us.
[00:30:07.433 --> 00:30:10.554]  You know the sun oven we ordered from you on KenSolar.com?
[00:30:10.794 --> 00:30:12.654]  It cooks all of our food and then some.
[00:30:12.935 --> 00:30:15.015]  Plus, we just sold the old gas barbecue.
[00:30:15.195 --> 00:30:21.317]  Also, the solar power generator reduced our electric bill just like you said it would, and it's powering my whole studio right now.
[00:30:21.497 --> 00:30:26.799]  We don't have to worry about our food going bad or surviving the outages anymore, either of which is huge.
[00:30:27.059 --> 00:30:29.920]  Well, Ken, I'll cut this one short for now, and thanks again.
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:30.960]  Go, Ken Solar!
[00:30:32.259 --> 00:30:33.800]  Get the best of both worlds.

[00:30:55.576 --> 00:30:59.399]  Order your solar power generator from Ken's website at KenSolar.com.
[00:31:01.295 --> 00:31:03.636]  America is the fattest nation on the planet.
[00:31:03.716 --> 00:31:10.220]  The obesity epidemic kills over 300,000 Americans each and every year, and this number continues to rise at an alarming rate.
[00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:13.481]  With fast food chains everywhere, eating right is not an easy task.
[00:31:13.701 --> 00:31:16.863]  It's time to stop eating those unhealthy meals and fattening snacks.
[00:31:17.123 --> 00:31:19.785]  Assured that you and your family do not become a statistic.
[00:31:20.005 --> 00:31:22.226]  Introducing the Excalibur Dehydrator.
[00:31:22.366 --> 00:31:25.267]  The Excalibur Dehydrator brings healthy eating to a whole new level.

[00:31:50.466 --> 00:31:50.666]  That's 1-800-875-4254.
[00:31:50.686 --> 00:31:51.127]  Or go to drawing123.com.
[00:31:51.187 --> 00:31:51.587]  That's drawing123.com.
[00:32:00.356 --> 00:32:00.557]  .com.
[00:32:01.218 --> 00:32:01.698]  We're good to go.
[00:32:31.118 --> 00:32:31.698]  We're good to go.
[00:32:31.738 --> 00:32:32.219]  We're good to go.
[00:33:01.525 --> 00:33:13.209]  All right, we've got a load of phone lines here.
[00:33:13.229 --> 00:33:20.111]  I'm just going to briefly give you my analysis of Ron Paul, and I'm sure the callers will bring up angles that we can all flesh out together and discuss.
[00:33:21.791 --> 00:33:23.812]  We have launched RonPaulWarRoom.com.
[00:33:24.012 --> 00:33:26.013]  It's already got some blog features.
[00:33:26.913 --> 00:33:29.674]  You know, get your own identity post on the main page.
[00:33:29.814 --> 00:33:30.614]  No censorship.
[00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:33.861]  You know, just right up there on the main page.
[00:33:34.661 --> 00:33:37.142]  Also, you can comment on other people's posts.
[00:33:37.222 --> 00:33:39.403]  We're going to add a message board the next week.
[00:33:39.423 --> 00:33:44.044]  We're also going to add your own posting section when you're on, so all your posts are together.
[00:33:44.064 --> 00:33:48.346]  So you can have your own little area on the site that's all being worked out and done right now.
[00:33:50.231 --> 00:33:51.232]  We're good to go.
[00:33:51.992 --> 00:33:52.852]  We're good to go.
[00:34:08.682 --> 00:34:13.005]  So that's ronpaulwarroom.com, but thousands of people have already gone and signed up and have been using it.
[00:34:13.345 --> 00:34:15.767]  There's hundreds of users posting at any one time on there.
[00:34:16.387 --> 00:34:18.548]  And just so many angles, so many facts.
[00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:23.832]  Not one person could ever know all the Ron Paul election news that's going on, or the New World Order news.
[00:34:24.112 --> 00:34:26.434]  It's not just Ron Paul, but it is the Ron Paul War Room.
[00:34:27.054 --> 00:34:28.695]  It's about liberty.
[00:34:30.436 --> 00:34:35.240]  Now, let me just be very, very specific about this.
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:36.400]  I was getting into Huckabee.
[00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:37.061]  Huckabee won.
[00:34:38.519 --> 00:34:38.999]  Handily.
[00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:40.220]  In Iowa.
[00:34:40.801 --> 00:34:42.382]  There is some evidence of chicanery.
[00:34:42.422 --> 00:34:43.183]  Later we'll get into that.
[00:34:43.223 --> 00:34:45.404]  But I have no doubt that he still took the day.
[00:34:45.965 --> 00:34:47.966]  I believe they just suppressed the rankings of Paul.
[00:34:48.747 --> 00:34:49.167]  Somewhat.
[00:34:51.769 --> 00:34:53.531]  And I've got a lot of factors that go into that.
[00:34:53.571 --> 00:34:54.772]  So I'm not just making these statements.
[00:34:55.132 --> 00:34:56.013]  But you already know that.
[00:34:56.573 --> 00:34:59.575]  I've just got so many hundreds of articles literally in front of me of facts I want to go over.
[00:34:59.615 --> 00:35:00.416]  It makes my head spin.
[00:35:01.277 --> 00:35:05.380]  But you have this chipmunk-like, bug-eyed demon...
[00:35:06.764 --> 00:35:07.265]  We're good to go.
[00:35:07.285 --> 00:35:07.945]  We're good to go.
[00:35:32.924 --> 00:35:34.105]  He's got a glass jaw, and he's perfect.
[00:35:58.154 --> 00:36:00.196]  For those that don't know, that's a boxing term.
[00:36:00.796 --> 00:36:02.498]  You hit him in the jaw, that rings their bell.
[00:36:02.518 --> 00:36:04.239]  He's easy to knock out with one hit.
[00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:05.280]  He's weak.
[00:36:06.061 --> 00:36:07.982]  He's got major chinks in the armor.
[00:36:09.244 --> 00:36:15.169]  In fact, instead of being a dragon with just a few missing scales, he's a dragon with no armored scales on his belly or chest.
[00:36:15.529 --> 00:36:18.672]  Just a big, flabbery, pink-faced...
[00:36:21.308 --> 00:36:27.411]  Magpie that likes to collect shiny pieces of tinfoil and put it in his nest with his stupid wife.
[00:36:27.471 --> 00:36:29.652]  Excuse me, I can't handle these people anymore.
[00:36:31.313 --> 00:36:34.975]  All these fake conservatives just make my blood absolutely start boiling.
[00:36:35.255 --> 00:36:36.156]  Start percolating.
[00:36:36.796 --> 00:36:38.317]  Like a percolating coffee maker.
[00:36:39.958 --> 00:36:41.318]  I'm not going to start yelling and screaming.
[00:36:41.959 --> 00:36:43.460]  I just can't look at Huckabee anymore.
[00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:45.981]  Or all the scumbag supporters.
[00:36:47.737 --> 00:36:54.679]  They're the ones that support the anti-gun NRA and won't believe me and won't check out NRA's fact that they write all the anti-gun legislation.
[00:36:55.519 --> 00:36:59.100]  They're the ones that still think Bush is of the Lord, and I just can't handle you anymore.
[00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:04.341]  Your ignorance, your stupidity, your weak-mindedness, your chicken-neckedness.
[00:37:05.861 --> 00:37:07.382]  All right, I'm not going to start calling you names.
[00:37:07.662 --> 00:37:08.682]  That's when I get really mad.
[00:37:10.222 --> 00:37:10.802]  Settle down.
[00:37:10.822 --> 00:37:11.723]  I want to go to your calls.
[00:37:12.103 --> 00:37:12.543]  Settle down.
[00:37:12.623 --> 00:37:13.003]  Settle down.
[00:37:15.538 --> 00:37:21.481]  So you've got this guy, and they all voted for him to try to knock down Pretty Boy because they're deathly afraid of the Mormons.
[00:37:23.922 --> 00:37:33.866]  And so you've got all that inter-sect warfare between the Masonic Protestants and the equally Masonic Mormons, and I'm not going to get off into a big argument about all this.
[00:37:33.906 --> 00:37:37.427]  The point is that they're all at each other's throats, which is ridiculous.
[00:37:38.628 --> 00:37:43.430]  And meanwhile, you've got Giuliani, who's totally unpopular, 4% of the vote,
[00:37:46.912 --> 00:37:50.676]  Mr. Bilderberg, Mr. New World Order, Mr. Transnafta Highway.
[00:37:50.696 --> 00:37:57.283]  It's just an absolute, complete train wreck.
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:01.842]  And so they bust out all their loyal minions who were part of the party machine.
[00:38:01.862 --> 00:38:02.582]  That's who makes it up.
[00:38:02.982 --> 00:38:04.963]  The caucus discouraged people, harassed people.
[00:38:04.984 --> 00:38:06.724]  There's a bunch of mainstream articles about that.
[00:38:07.105 --> 00:38:09.266]  Turning Ron Paul caucus folks away.
[00:38:09.286 --> 00:38:10.846]  It's very Byzantine.
[00:38:11.307 --> 00:38:13.148]  Then they telephone the calls in.
[00:38:13.208 --> 00:38:14.288]  I saw this last night.
[00:38:14.648 --> 00:38:15.409]  Checked into it.
[00:38:15.449 --> 00:38:17.530]  Christopher Bolin's about 98% accurate.
[00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:18.490]  I think he means well.
[00:38:18.971 --> 00:38:21.652]  He kind of went off the reservation and attacked me a year or so ago, but
[00:38:22.561 --> 00:38:24.102]  People do things like that.
[00:38:24.583 --> 00:38:50.543]  We got in with folks that were, but I went and did some Google searches, analyzed what he said, and on the surface, with about an hour of research, it looks accurate that an Israeli Mossad front is the company that the different precinct heads with the Iowa caucus call into, and then their phone calls then go down the data bank system and are tabulated by computers.
[00:38:51.801 --> 00:38:53.022]  And so that's a big issue.
[00:38:53.622 --> 00:38:56.383]  A lot of people are saying, yeah, but Israel's man is Giuliani.
[00:38:57.204 --> 00:39:00.465]  Well, how come he wants to nuke the Middle East, too, and wants Armageddon?
[00:39:01.366 --> 00:39:19.755]  And so, it looks like they may be, if there is Israeli fraud here, and if you didn't know Israeli, Israel gets involved in our politics, you're living on the moon, or Mars, or maybe even out further, maybe out on Chiron or something, but
[00:39:21.243 --> 00:39:23.284]  There's definitely something going on there.
[00:39:23.304 --> 00:39:24.564]  It stinks really bad.
[00:39:25.184 --> 00:39:27.225]  So we commend Bowen for looking into that.
[00:39:27.245 --> 00:39:30.867]  That's up on truthnews.us right now.
[00:39:34.868 --> 00:39:39.150]  Because Huckabee... There's a lot of wheels within wheels.
[00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:45.312]  Huckabee's pro-Armageddon, double Israel's funding, worship Israel, Pastor Hagee type.
[00:39:46.512 --> 00:39:50.534]  And Giuliani's just a secular hand everything over to Israel type.
[00:39:52.034 --> 00:40:01.823]  And they can also want to stall things out with him because he's got a glass jaw, and then get Hillary in, who's also an AIPAC minion.
[00:40:03.124 --> 00:40:06.387]  So that's going on there, and I've got to give you accurate political analysis.
[00:40:06.407 --> 00:40:10.391]  I don't like getting into this political hot-button stuff, but the facts are the facts.
[00:40:12.733 --> 00:40:14.255]  So that's happening right there.
[00:40:15.376 --> 00:40:16.757]  But on the Ron Paul front...
[00:40:17.463 --> 00:40:26.451]  Whatever went on, fifth place is good in Iowa because that thing is as crooked as a dog's hind leg or as a barrel of snakes as we say here in Central Texas.
[00:40:30.954 --> 00:40:38.080]  And where they don't have a system that is as riggable, I mean it's one of the cleanest systems in the country, is New Hampshire.
[00:40:39.942 --> 00:40:40.062]  And
[00:40:41.058 --> 00:40:42.780]  That's why it's such a key battleground state.
[00:40:43.181 --> 00:40:48.648]  And Ron Paul has said, I'm predicting if there isn't chicanery, he's going to get second place.
[00:40:48.708 --> 00:40:51.131]  I don't think he's actually going to win New Hampshire.
[00:40:51.511 --> 00:40:54.855]  But remember, Jimmy Carter got 1% in New Hampshire.
[00:40:56.317 --> 00:40:59.721]  Bill Clinton lost New Hampshire, but then won in other states.
[00:41:03.078 --> 00:41:07.301]  Again, I mean, if Ron Paul gets second place, it is an ultra-massive victory.
[00:41:07.682 --> 00:41:09.223]  Third place, big victory.
[00:41:09.563 --> 00:41:11.705]  Fourth place, not good.
[00:41:12.605 --> 00:41:16.308]  I'll tell you, fourth place, and I'm just being honest, I'm up pep rallying here.
[00:41:16.328 --> 00:41:17.589]  You'll hear a lot of that out there.
[00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:20.171]  People regurgitating things they've heard.
[00:41:20.191 --> 00:41:22.453]  I mean, I've got a pretty good political noggin.
[00:41:23.974 --> 00:41:27.537]  Let's just say behind the scenes for years I've been consulted on things.
[00:41:29.919 --> 00:41:30.799]  Well, I'm not going to get into it.
[00:41:30.819 --> 00:41:32.501]  The point is that
[00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:36.601]  If he gets a fourth place, that's really bad.
[00:41:38.482 --> 00:41:39.543]  Third place is big.
[00:41:39.963 --> 00:41:41.064]  Second place is massive.
[00:41:41.104 --> 00:41:43.445]  First place is just look out.
[00:41:43.485 --> 00:41:46.287]  You better get bodyguards all around Ron Paul real fast.
[00:41:46.327 --> 00:41:47.808]  And then, like they said, they go into Nevada.
[00:41:48.288 --> 00:41:49.409]  They go into the Carolinas.
[00:41:49.429 --> 00:41:53.311]  They go into places where he's in 15, 20% numbers now.
[00:41:53.692 --> 00:41:55.973]  And it's growing by a point or two every week.
[00:41:56.413 --> 00:41:58.895]  See, if we had a month or so, he'd be winning these hands down.
[00:41:59.495 --> 00:42:01.016]  It's a race against time.
[00:42:01.376 --> 00:42:04.018]  And if you don't think they're not going to have operatives in New Hampshire...
[00:42:04.651 --> 00:42:10.513]  If you don't think they're not going to be pulling all the stops in Michigan and Nevada and the Carolinas, you've got another thing coming.
[00:42:11.613 --> 00:42:13.614]  So we need eyes and ears there watching everything.
[00:42:14.994 --> 00:42:16.255]  But I want to say this again.
[00:42:16.635 --> 00:42:19.776]  We win if Ron Paul loses.
[00:42:19.996 --> 00:42:21.316]  We win if he wins.
[00:42:21.776 --> 00:42:24.377]  We win if he has a strong showing.
[00:42:25.097 --> 00:42:26.978]  But let me just give you the breaks, then I'm going to go to your calls.
[00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:32.840]  Let's say...
[00:42:34.312 --> 00:42:37.555]  Ron Paul gets second place in New Hampshire.
[00:42:37.615 --> 00:42:39.596]  Springboards gets second place in Nevada.
[00:42:40.197 --> 00:42:41.218]  Third place in Michigan.
[00:42:41.698 --> 00:42:43.439]  Springboards into Super Tuesday.
[00:42:43.759 --> 00:42:45.661]  By then, he'll raise another 20-something mil.
[00:42:46.061 --> 00:42:50.345]  Have money for ads, TV, in the battleground states on Super Tuesday.
[00:42:50.765 --> 00:42:53.267]  Wins four or five of them, gets second, third place in the rest.
[00:42:55.797 --> 00:43:00.141]  It's going to be complete bedlam, and they're going to start putting out fake stories about him.
[00:43:00.661 --> 00:43:04.184]  You'll probably have women come out and say things that are asinine.
[00:43:04.204 --> 00:43:06.626]  You'll probably, I mean, it's going to be amazing.
[00:43:07.046 --> 00:43:07.807]  Just get ready for that.
[00:43:07.967 --> 00:43:09.969]  If that happens to take place, and it could.
[00:43:10.589 --> 00:43:12.911]  See, six months ago, you didn't believe it could be happening.
[00:43:12.931 --> 00:43:14.212]  Remember, I kept telling you it could.
[00:43:14.232 --> 00:43:15.834]  I'm not saying, oh, I'm smart.
[00:43:15.874 --> 00:43:17.195]  Look, I told you this could happen.
[00:43:17.695 --> 00:43:22.039]  I told you he could be, you know, poised to win.
[00:43:23.055 --> 00:43:24.781]  He could be exponentially growing.
[00:43:25.102 --> 00:43:29.536]  Remember a year ago when Ron Paul basically announced on this show, one day after he announced he was here.
[00:43:33.436 --> 00:43:38.001]  So you have to realize that, A, this is about a movement growing.
[00:43:38.041 --> 00:43:40.323]  This is about communities of liberty forming.
[00:43:40.704 --> 00:43:45.689]  This is about the left-right paradigm completely collapsing, which has now happened in the activist communities.
[00:43:46.029 --> 00:43:49.953]  Hardcore liberals waking up, buying guns, finding out about the New World Order.
[00:43:50.273 --> 00:43:53.677]  Conservatives not thinking that liberals are blood-drinking demons.
[00:43:54.821 --> 00:43:57.023]  You know, now realizing they've got some points.
[00:43:57.503 --> 00:44:01.186]  I mean, it's a coming together right now, and they don't want that.
[00:44:01.246 --> 00:44:02.427]  They want to divide and conquer.
[00:44:02.748 --> 00:44:03.829]  They want us against each other.
[00:44:03.889 --> 00:44:07.111]  So this is a beautiful thing regardless.
[00:44:07.171 --> 00:44:21.063]  I mean, if you lay in the ditch and give up and say there's nothing we can do and say there's no change we can affect and that there's no fighting city hall and Ron Paul can never win and nobody can win at your county or city level,
[00:44:21.804 --> 00:44:22.665]  Running for liberty.
[00:44:23.205 --> 00:44:24.707]  No, this shows us that you can.
[00:44:24.767 --> 00:44:26.528]  This shows us that we've got a fighting chance.
[00:44:26.849 --> 00:44:33.314]  This shows us that if you'll just suit up and get on the field and do little things, we can move mountains together with God's help.
[00:44:35.056 --> 00:44:39.400]  And I know you consciously understand that, but I want it to really burn into your heart.
[00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:41.421]  I want it to burn into your subconscious.
[00:44:41.501 --> 00:44:47.887]  I want you to really understand and realize that in each and every one of you, there is the seed of the universe, as Mahatma Gandhi said.
[00:44:49.451 --> 00:44:51.192]  And I'm not a Hindu.
[00:44:51.632 --> 00:44:52.653]  Jesus said similar things.
[00:44:52.673 --> 00:44:56.315]  My point is that you're made in the image of the Creator.
[00:44:56.355 --> 00:44:57.215]  I mean, you're special.
[00:44:57.275 --> 00:44:58.296]  Humans are amazing.
[00:44:58.656 --> 00:44:59.616]  Life is incredible.
[00:44:59.876 --> 00:45:01.197]  None of you should ever be bored.
[00:45:01.217 --> 00:45:02.958]  None of you should ever be unhappy.
[00:45:03.058 --> 00:45:03.938]  Life is beautiful.
[00:45:03.978 --> 00:45:04.559]  It is wonderful.
[00:45:04.599 --> 00:45:05.219]  It is gracious.
[00:45:05.239 --> 00:45:05.759]  It is happy.
[00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:08.841]  It is magical.
[00:45:08.901 --> 00:45:09.601]  It is enchanted.
[00:45:09.641 --> 00:45:11.202]  It is whatever term you want to use.
[00:45:11.222 --> 00:45:11.963]  It is electric.
[00:45:12.723 --> 00:45:13.643]  It is effervescent.
[00:45:13.703 --> 00:45:16.845]  It is primordial.
[00:45:16.945 --> 00:45:18.066]  It is eternal.
[00:45:18.086 --> 00:45:18.226]  It is
[00:45:19.215 --> 00:45:22.717]  Transcendent.
[00:45:22.897 --> 00:45:25.739]  It is multifaceted, multivariate.
[00:45:26.559 --> 00:45:27.360]  Interwoven.
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:29.701]  Interlayered, as they say.
[00:45:31.842 --> 00:45:34.984]  And everybody's talking about the Federal Reserve now.
[00:45:35.024 --> 00:45:35.745]  I mean, literally.
[00:45:36.025 --> 00:45:37.346]  Everybody's learning about liberty.
[00:45:38.026 --> 00:45:40.107]  These are just seeds being planted now, see?
[00:45:40.127 --> 00:45:42.488]  Remember I always told you, be Johnny Appleseeds.
[00:45:43.389 --> 00:45:48.452]  I mean, there are people making hundreds of thousands of copies of Endgame, Blueprint, or Global Enslavement everywhere and handing it out.
[00:45:49.156 --> 00:45:53.540]  Hundreds of thousands of copies, millions of copies of Freedom to Fascism being handed out.
[00:45:55.061 --> 00:45:57.303]  I mean, it's all happening, loose change, all of it.
[00:45:57.363 --> 00:46:00.726]  It's all happening right now because of you.
[00:46:01.246 --> 00:46:02.227]  You want to know who did this?
[00:46:02.347 --> 00:46:02.967]  It's you.
[00:46:03.988 --> 00:46:04.869]  And why is it you?
[00:46:05.169 --> 00:46:14.377]  Because this is one of the first big shows out that has been there for a long time, and this is a show where we all came together, where we realized we had power, where we realized we could have victories, and where we took action.
[00:46:15.689 --> 00:46:33.654]  And it makes us all safer as more people wake up, as more talk show hosts go on air, as more networks go up, as more... All these networks trying to slit each other's throats and fight with each other, and I always try to reach out to everybody, but they always bite the hand that feeds them, so I just kind of put them in a cage and lean back and hope they realize that rising tides raise all ships.
[00:46:36.155 --> 00:46:37.435]  We've got to come together.
[00:46:37.756 --> 00:46:39.256]  We've got to defeat the New World Order.
[00:46:39.276 --> 00:46:40.036]  We don't have a choice.
[00:46:40.056 --> 00:46:42.457]  They're building a total grid of enslavement around us.
[00:46:44.531 --> 00:46:45.912]  So, Ron Paul could win.
[00:46:47.493 --> 00:46:49.674]  They don't have complete rigging ability everywhere.
[00:46:49.694 --> 00:46:51.695]  He'll definitely continue to educate.
[00:46:51.715 --> 00:46:54.197]  He could win politically, but he's already won.
[00:46:54.437 --> 00:46:55.658]  You know, last night people said, oh, only 10%.
[00:46:56.198 --> 00:46:57.759]  At about midnight I was up.
[00:46:58.539 --> 00:47:00.280]  One o'clock, everybody was depressed.
[00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:01.541]  About a half the people were.
[00:47:02.422 --> 00:47:04.183]  Others were pointing out, look, it's a huge win.
[00:47:04.623 --> 00:47:07.124]  Look, he was, you know, 1% six months ago.
[00:47:08.145 --> 00:47:10.767]  Look, you know, he's at 10% there in a rigged system.
[00:47:11.447 --> 00:47:13.148]  And they're admitting he could win New Hampshire.
[00:47:14.446 --> 00:47:17.747]  Most opponents and experts say third place.
[00:47:17.787 --> 00:47:18.788]  I'm saying second, probably.
[00:47:19.148 --> 00:47:19.808]  Maybe even first.
[00:47:19.828 --> 00:47:20.649]  Who knows what's going to happen?
[00:47:21.209 --> 00:47:22.269]  Lightning's in a bottle here.
[00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:26.011]  So there's a lot of things going on.
[00:47:27.572 --> 00:47:35.235]  But regardless, anti-New World Order, pro-liberty, the idea of legalizing freedom, the idea of
[00:47:36.633 --> 00:47:54.222]  Demanding our Constitution back, demanding America back, demanding our basic ideals and the foundations of our way of life, that rediscovery, that renaissance, that revelation that I have talked so much about and so many others have discussed, that is now rising.
[00:47:54.823 --> 00:47:56.323]  That is now with us.
[00:47:57.284 --> 00:47:59.465]  It is now here and growing exponentially.
[00:48:00.558 --> 00:48:07.165]  And if some of you would stop being pessimists, some of you that are being pessimists and would just realize that and have a good attitude, that's the first change.
[00:48:07.605 --> 00:48:09.126]  And realize we can affect change.
[00:48:09.186 --> 00:48:10.388]  And realize we can fight evil.
[00:48:10.928 --> 00:48:13.070]  And get past your fear also.
[00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:15.873]  The first fear, what your neighbor thinks, your spouse thinks, your boss thinks.
[00:48:16.193 --> 00:48:16.794]  So what?
[00:48:17.935 --> 00:48:19.917]  Learn to get outside your comfort zone.
[00:48:19.957 --> 00:48:20.898]  Learn to speak out.
[00:48:21.518 --> 00:48:22.579]  Learn to not be timid.
[00:48:22.619 --> 00:48:24.041]  Learn to be able to speak to people.
[00:48:25.678 --> 00:48:26.479]  We don't have time.
[00:48:26.519 --> 00:48:29.661]  A lot of you don't like to talk, don't like to write, don't like to... Hey, you better!
[00:48:29.941 --> 00:48:30.341]  You better!
[00:48:30.361 --> 00:48:32.843]  I mean, these people have actually built FEMA camps.
[00:48:33.583 --> 00:48:36.886]  These individuals are actually putting bioweapons in our food and water.
[00:48:41.729 --> 00:48:42.689]  They're actually killing us.
[00:48:42.709 --> 00:48:43.710]  They're waging war on us.
[00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:44.971]  They're playing God.
[00:48:45.011 --> 00:48:51.455]  They're a guild of control freaks that understand controlling systems, controlling societies, controlling infrastructures.
[00:48:51.796 --> 00:48:55.418]  Being monopoly men gives them total control, and that's what they're all about.
[00:48:56.215 --> 00:48:59.996]  And they've been in dominant control for hundreds of years.
[00:49:00.056 --> 00:49:07.499]  Now they want total, absolute control, and they're trying to get it, and they're making their move, and that's tipped their hand, and a lot of people now are paying attention.
[00:49:07.519 --> 00:49:09.940]  They don't know exactly what they're seeing, but it stinks.
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:11.221]  People's instincts.
[00:49:13.662 --> 00:49:14.882]  And you all got them, folks.
[00:49:15.042 --> 00:49:24.886]  I can, you know, I've told the story of walking through the woods, off-season, hunting hogs when I was 15, pair of shorts, camo shirt,
[00:49:27.113 --> 00:49:30.195]  You know, .308 semi-auto rifle.
[00:49:32.617 --> 00:49:33.778]  Feel something looking at me.
[00:49:34.858 --> 00:49:37.900]  And again, I'm the only people that creeps around in the woods just constantly feeling things.
[00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:38.441]  Constantly.
[00:49:38.481 --> 00:49:38.761]  No, no.
[00:49:39.381 --> 00:49:40.322]  Feel somebody looking at me.
[00:49:40.342 --> 00:49:41.263]  Feel something going on.
[00:49:41.323 --> 00:49:42.363]  Hair on the back of my neck stands up.
[00:49:42.624 --> 00:49:48.367]  Big old Mexican Red Wolf runs right out in front of me across the path and goes through the bushes before I can get my rifle up.
[00:49:50.869 --> 00:49:51.930]  Another time I'm out there.
[00:49:52.924 --> 00:49:53.864]  I feel somebody looking at me.
[00:49:53.904 --> 00:49:54.385]  I feel them.
[00:49:54.625 --> 00:49:55.505]  I walk out of the woods.
[00:49:55.525 --> 00:49:56.446]  I walk in the direction.
[00:49:56.986 --> 00:50:02.308]  And they climb to stand, and they're basically poaching up in the tree off-season with a bow.
[00:50:02.808 --> 00:50:04.949]  And, oh, sorry, didn't know I was across the line.
[00:50:05.169 --> 00:50:12.132]  Then another time, I didn't know they let somebody out there in the front bow hunt, and I was out there, and I felt them looking at me in the middle of hundreds and hundreds of acres.
[00:50:13.753 --> 00:50:18.435]  And, I mean, I'm not just feeling it going to the direction it's at hundreds of yards away.
[00:50:20.419 --> 00:50:22.360]  See, all of you have that, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:23.821]  You have it in your gut.
[00:50:24.261 --> 00:50:29.003]  You wouldn't be here if your ancestors didn't have that when a saber-toothed cat was waiting for them to come around the corner.
[00:50:35.926 --> 00:50:36.646]  See how that works?
[00:50:37.426 --> 00:50:38.147]  It's the same thing.
[00:50:38.227 --> 00:50:40.087]  You know stuff's going on right now.
[00:50:41.208 --> 00:50:43.609]  You know they're building a cage around you, a control grid.
[00:50:44.278 --> 00:50:44.738]  You know.
[00:50:44.898 --> 00:50:47.239]  And then they know you know, but you can't put your finger on it.
[00:50:47.259 --> 00:50:49.359]  They say, that fear you have is Al-Qaeda.
[00:50:49.679 --> 00:50:50.439]  That anxiety.
[00:50:50.479 --> 00:50:53.300]  People say, you know, Al-Qaeda may not be real, but I feel afraid.
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:54.800]  Yeah, you're afraid of the government.
[00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:57.360]  Your instincts are going, man, we're in danger.
[00:50:57.681 --> 00:50:59.261]  And you bet your bottom dollar you are.
[00:51:01.921 --> 00:51:03.302]  It is a big idea.
[00:51:03.322 --> 00:51:05.442]  A new world order.
[00:51:06.162 --> 00:51:10.483]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by powerful governments.
[00:51:11.058 --> 00:51:12.839]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:16.122]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:51:16.662 --> 00:51:19.124]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:51:19.844 --> 00:51:27.170]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:51:30.191 --> 00:51:35.194]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:51:35.635 --> 00:51:39.117]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:51:39.517 --> 00:51:41.999]  Hilbert is making great progress toward a world of government.
[00:51:42.059 --> 00:51:43.220]  Most people have no idea.
[00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:44.000]  They're not after money.
[00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:45.121]  They have all the money they need.
[00:51:45.301 --> 00:51:46.122]  They're after power.
[00:51:46.282 --> 00:51:47.142]  That's their aptitude.
[00:51:47.423 --> 00:51:55.648]  Order Endgame on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:51:56.108 --> 00:51:58.890]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:51:58.950 --> 00:52:00.011]  You have been warned.
[00:52:00.851 --> 00:52:04.293]  Attention, this is Jack Blood with an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[00:52:04.533 --> 00:52:06.634]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[00:52:06.794 --> 00:52:09.255]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[00:52:09.515 --> 00:52:13.877]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there is a very real chance you will now be able to do it.
[00:52:13.917 --> 00:52:14.578]  Here's why.
[00:52:14.998 --> 00:52:20.921]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[00:52:21.161 --> 00:52:27.163]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating.
[00:52:27.404 --> 00:52:28.324]  But they're not cheating.
[00:52:28.564 --> 00:52:29.345]  We're good to go.
[00:52:46.187 --> 00:52:46.887]  Get some sleep.
[00:52:46.988 --> 00:52:50.191]  Go to www.outin90.com.
[00:52:50.311 --> 00:52:53.694]  That's www.outin90.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:52:53.714 --> 00:52:53.914]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:53:01.104 --> 00:53:04.287]  Yes, there is an in-dash AM-FM shortwave radio.

[00:53:21.321 --> 00:53:25.144]  Get your Sony AM-FM shortwave radio and CD player from the Power Hour today.
[00:53:25.524 --> 00:53:26.085]  We're good to go.
[00:53:26.105 --> 00:53:26.605]  We're good to go.
[00:53:44.738 --> 00:53:45.018]  Big time.
[00:53:45.058 --> 00:53:45.298]  Big time.
[00:54:07.316 --> 00:54:17.699]  All right, we just got a call from Jesse Benton.
[00:54:17.839 --> 00:54:19.379]  Ron Paul just got off the plane.
[00:54:19.399 --> 00:54:22.420]  Looks like he's going to be on with us via telephone from a car.
[00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:24.300]  Never done a car interview with Ron Paul.
[00:54:24.801 --> 00:54:27.681]  And his son's scheduled to be on at the same time, so maybe I'll have them both on together.
[00:54:28.161 --> 00:54:28.942]  I don't know what's going to happen.
[00:54:28.982 --> 00:54:29.702]  It's all crazy.
[00:54:30.622 --> 00:54:33.683]  Don't forget ronpaulwarroom.com, ronpaulwarroom.com.
[00:54:34.987 --> 00:54:36.608]  Let's just go ahead and go to some of your calls.
[00:54:37.028 --> 00:54:43.312]  Brandon in Iowa, scene of the first battleground primary last night where Ron Paul got double digits.
[00:54:43.352 --> 00:54:43.732]  Go ahead.
[00:54:44.193 --> 00:54:44.533]  Hey, Alex.
[00:54:44.553 --> 00:54:45.033]  How's it going?
[00:54:45.153 --> 00:54:45.514]  Good, sir.
[00:54:46.514 --> 00:54:50.416]  Just want to say in the last segment, you and Kent were definitely right.
[00:54:51.577 --> 00:54:59.422]  Iowa is a bit of a weird duck, if you will, because the people know that something's wrong, but unfortunately all they do is
[00:54:59.966 --> 00:55:00.827]  Turn to their TV.
[00:55:00.907 --> 00:55:01.947]  It's kind of ridiculous.
[00:55:02.348 --> 00:55:08.532]  Well, I remember Iowa was the first place we saw the troops doing martial law drills and actually doing law enforcement searching cars.
[00:55:10.113 --> 00:55:10.593]  Absolutely.
[00:55:10.653 --> 00:55:11.654]  That's right.
[00:55:11.854 --> 00:55:14.836]  I'm not knocking Iowa ones, but it's weird.
[00:55:15.996 --> 00:55:16.277]  It is.
[00:55:16.717 --> 00:55:21.360]  The other thing you were saying I just want to comment on is you're absolutely right.
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:24.782]  Step out of your comfort zone and get up and talk to people.
[00:55:24.842 --> 00:55:27.784]  I'm in my old stomping ground
[00:55:28.756 --> 00:55:35.160]  Finishing up Christmas break, and I was the only one that went up and talked about Ron Paul right before they cast the vote.
[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:37.681]  Oh, good job.
[00:55:38.902 --> 00:55:40.663]  Sorry, a little nervous here, first-time caller.
[00:55:43.364 --> 00:55:44.845]  I'm always my own worst critic.
[00:55:45.786 --> 00:55:46.646]  Thought I could have done better.
[00:55:47.226 --> 00:55:48.627]  Hey, you know what matters?
[00:55:48.687 --> 00:55:49.708]  Who is in the arena?
[00:55:50.588 --> 00:55:53.690]  You win by getting in the arena, and you get stronger by being in the arena.
[00:55:53.710 --> 00:55:54.590]  You're doing a great job.
[00:55:54.971 --> 00:55:55.351]  Thanks, man.
[00:55:56.209 --> 00:55:57.030]  Just want to finish up.
[00:55:57.350 --> 00:55:59.131]  Once again, it doesn't matter what people think.
[00:55:59.191 --> 00:56:04.556]  I've been listening to you since I was a senior, right before martial law came out.
[00:56:05.997 --> 00:56:07.198]  It doesn't matter what people think.
[00:56:07.919 --> 00:56:15.145]  I'm known as the long-haired, crazy kid who only reads conspiracy websites and all this stuff.
[00:56:15.165 --> 00:56:22.951]  It doesn't matter because the rest of the population, all they know is what happened on Facebook or the latest scripted reality TV show.
[00:56:24.830 --> 00:56:28.613]  All they do is kind of laugh at Ron Paul supporters, but it's not like it matters, you know?
[00:56:29.334 --> 00:56:32.437]  Yeah, they're going to be laughing when they find out their dollars have been devalued by more than 60%.
[00:56:32.557 --> 00:56:39.643]  I mean, I still get emails and see stuff on Bloomberg and television where they laugh and say the dollar's great.
[00:56:40.264 --> 00:56:44.668]  Hey, just snickering and being a chicken-necked yuppie doesn't make it okay, chicken necks.
[00:56:46.549 --> 00:56:47.110]  Absolutely right.
[00:56:48.123 --> 00:56:51.596]  No, I mean, they just think laughing and snickering gives them power over it.
[00:56:51.977 --> 00:56:54.667]  And I assure you, what's happening to this country is not funny.
[00:56:55.626 --> 00:56:58.128]  And God forbid it happens, but there's a good chance it is.
[00:56:58.468 --> 00:57:00.309]  A hellacious depression.
[00:57:00.669 --> 00:57:05.312]  They're not going to be smiling like Cheshire Cats with a you-know-what grin on their face anymore.
[00:57:06.313 --> 00:57:11.256]  And they're going to remember all the seeds we planted, how we told them, who we told them was behind it.
[00:57:11.676 --> 00:57:17.260]  Believe me, sir, as much as you think the awakening is happening now, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:18.440]  I appreciate your call.
[00:57:18.881 --> 00:57:19.701]  Good job, my friend.
[00:57:19.721 --> 00:57:21.182]  Good to have you on board with us for four years.
[00:57:23.323 --> 00:57:24.084]  That's the bottom line.
[00:57:25.603 --> 00:57:29.704]  You see, tyranny is the rain and the sunshine for revolution.
[00:57:30.885 --> 00:57:33.006]  Those seeds are laying there in barren fields.
[00:57:33.626 --> 00:57:34.566]  The tyranny was bad.
[00:57:34.586 --> 00:57:43.449]  There was some water, some sun, but it wasn't getting down into the seeds that were so deep with their heads in the sand they didn't see what was happening on the surface.
[00:57:44.990 --> 00:57:45.650]  Like some of us.
[00:57:47.071 --> 00:57:47.852]  We're good to go.
[00:58:15.131 --> 00:58:19.874]  And so all the rain, perfect growing conditions, perfect growing conditions.
[00:58:20.154 --> 00:58:32.683]  That's why they're racing with the control grid, the military design, face scanning cameras, license plate reading systems, the tracker grids, the cell phone trackers, trying to take a tenth of our college population, turn them into spies publicly.
[00:58:33.123 --> 00:58:36.485]  They're moving against us, and I'm looking at the cards.
[00:58:36.505 --> 00:58:38.126]  We've got a good chance of kicking their butt.
[00:58:38.387 --> 00:58:39.567]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:46.258 --> 00:58:48.559]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:52.020]  Now.
[00:58:57.862 --> 00:58:58.542]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.162 --> 00:59:00.262]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.943 --> 00:59:02.063]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.703 --> 00:59:03.523]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.264 --> 00:59:06.184]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.204 --> 00:59:09.805]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.005 --> 00:59:14.127]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:22.725 --> 00:59:27.449]  All right, Ron Paul campaign just called us.
[00:59:27.790 --> 00:59:37.479]  They're trying to get to a studio, and there's traffic, so Ron Paul can do the interview before or after the TV interview he's got to do in New Hampshire.
[00:59:37.519 --> 00:59:38.540]  The guy's just running to death.
[00:59:39.521 --> 00:59:42.963]  So he's still in the pike, five by five.
[00:59:43.964 --> 00:59:45.945]  That is, he's in the line to be on today.
[00:59:46.025 --> 00:59:47.426]  Rand Paul's coming up in the next segment.
[00:59:47.766 --> 00:59:51.968]  Very special surprise, Ron Paul guest, coming up in about 20 minutes.
[00:59:53.049 --> 00:59:55.770]  So right now, let's go back to your calls.
[00:59:56.691 --> 00:59:58.932]  Aaron in Brooklyn, and then Evette and others.
[00:59:59.092 --> 01:00:00.073]  Aaron, you're on the air.
[01:00:00.773 --> 01:00:01.253]  Hey, Alex.
[01:00:01.653 --> 01:00:01.954]  Hi.
[01:00:03.414 --> 01:00:08.037]  I was up late last night thinking, you know, after everything happened, chatting some
[01:00:08.871 --> 01:00:09.892]  Well, I mean, Uncle Tom's Cabin
[01:00:37.506 --> 01:00:42.507]  Woke people up, you know, about issues with black oppression, slavery, whatever.
[01:00:42.527 --> 01:00:52.410]  And then you had the jungle waking people up to the corruption of the robber barons and people being falling into sausage machines and being turned into part of the sausage and fake milk.
[01:00:52.530 --> 01:00:56.571]  The robber barons would literally give chalk to women for their babies and the babies would die in mass.
[01:00:56.851 --> 01:01:01.592]  They do the same thing in Africa and Asia where tens of thousands will die every few months where they give them fake milk.
[01:01:01.912 --> 01:01:03.853]  The big aid agencies do it on purpose, by the way.
[01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:05.701]  That's all part of eugenics.
[01:01:06.662 --> 01:01:09.424]  So I don't think there's going to be one Uncle Tom's Cabin.
[01:01:09.444 --> 01:01:12.086]  I don't think there's going to be one The Jungle.
[01:01:12.106 --> 01:01:14.568]  I don't think there's going to be one Common Sense.
[01:01:15.549 --> 01:01:19.032]  Instead, it's more like a million missiles hitting them.
[01:01:19.432 --> 01:01:27.859]  I mean, you've got loose changes, end games, road to tyrannies, martial laws, terror storms.
[01:01:28.279 --> 01:01:30.761]  I mean, I think Ron Paul...
[01:01:32.651 --> 01:01:35.192]  He is one of those seminal characters.
[01:01:35.252 --> 01:01:37.193]  I mean, he's kind of a George Washington.
[01:01:38.294 --> 01:01:44.097]  And then you could say that some of the other patriot leaders and people could be like Sam Adams.
[01:01:44.537 --> 01:01:57.084]  You know, the people that had money, people that had time, people that had the initiative to print up tens of thousands of flyers, to run around and stir things up, to give speeches, to bang their fist, to call for getting it on.
[01:01:57.824 --> 01:02:01.026]  And then there's also flashpoints where people just say, you know what?
[01:02:01.917 --> 01:02:04.439]  Let's start smashing these surveillance cameras.
[01:02:04.579 --> 01:02:11.303]  The equivalent is, let's go dump millions of pounds of British sterling into the Boston Harbor.
[01:02:16.952 --> 01:02:17.332]  We're good to go.
[01:02:17.352 --> 01:02:18.053]  We're good to go.
[01:02:18.093 --> 01:02:18.553]  We're good to go.
[01:02:38.237 --> 01:02:38.758]  And it's over.
[01:02:39.238 --> 01:02:44.142]  You're going to see a bunch of cops in black uniforms when people actually get mad, be totally overrun.
[01:02:44.502 --> 01:02:47.804]  The cops will mow a bunch of them down and then cities are going to start burning.
[01:02:47.964 --> 01:02:52.768]  Then the cops are going to join us and then it's going to be absolute UN invasion forces.
[01:02:53.228 --> 01:02:54.369]  This is a possible future.
[01:02:54.409 --> 01:02:57.312]  I'm not saying it's going to happen, but it's probably a 30% chance.
[01:02:57.692 --> 01:03:00.174]  And then it's going to be just absolute warfare in the streets.
[01:03:01.235 --> 01:03:02.956]  Do you think it's going to be their failing?
[01:03:03.556 --> 01:03:06.999]  They're going to play their hand and come out just blatantly and
[01:03:07.648 --> 01:03:11.729]  It'll just be obvious that the government is the enemy.
[01:03:11.849 --> 01:03:14.890]  They're going to have massacres, like the Boston Massacre.
[01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:17.311]  Okay?
[01:03:17.671 --> 01:03:20.271]  Waco, basically, was a huge seed.
[01:03:20.291 --> 01:03:32.655]  It looks tiny now, but you talk to most people who woke up in that wave, like myself, most of the people that are, quote, old-timers, or the captains of our movement for liberty now, got active after Waco, okay?
[01:03:33.295 --> 01:03:33.455]  Yeah.
[01:03:34.733 --> 01:03:35.574]  Hey, I appreciate your call.
[01:03:35.594 --> 01:03:36.454]  It's a really great question.
[01:03:36.474 --> 01:03:37.675]  I've had everybody else.
[01:03:37.755 --> 01:03:40.517]  You're going to get on, but we've got a lot of guests lined up, too, so stay with us.

[01:03:42.839 --> 01:03:43.400]  It is a big idea.
[01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:44.500]  A new world order.
[01:03:44.741 --> 01:03:48.684]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by our world governments.
[01:04:03.078 --> 01:04:04.819]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:08.141]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:04:08.682 --> 01:04:11.123]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:04:11.864 --> 01:04:19.189]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:04:22.202 --> 01:04:27.183]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:04:27.643 --> 01:04:31.124]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:04:31.504 --> 01:04:34.024]  They'll make great progress for the world government.
[01:04:34.084 --> 01:04:35.064]  Most people have no idea.
[01:04:35.084 --> 01:04:36.004]  They're not after money.
[01:04:36.024 --> 01:04:37.105]  They have all the money they need.
[01:04:37.305 --> 01:04:38.065]  They're after power.
[01:04:38.305 --> 01:04:39.145]  That's what happens.

[01:04:52.978 --> 01:05:00.902]  For years, you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained a leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[01:05:01.382 --> 01:05:04.524]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?
[01:05:04.924 --> 01:05:07.965]  The answer is high quality and huge selection.

[01:05:52.967 --> 01:05:56.288]  Attention GCN listeners who suffer from excruciating joint pain.
[01:05:56.628 --> 01:06:03.530]  If you're interested in suppressed but amazingly effective traditional arthritis remedies, this will be the single most important message you'll ever hear.
[01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:16.393]  Recently, a scientist who specializes in ancient medicine has discovered a 3,000-year-old arthritis remedy that has been proven in studies not only to relieve joint pain and inflammation but also to build damaged cartilage as well.
[01:06:16.633 --> 01:06:19.274]  And the amazing thing is just how fast it works.
[01:06:19.614 --> 01:06:25.817]  Now, because the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made for this ancient remedy.
[01:06:26.057 --> 01:06:27.978]  However, it is still legal to own it.
[01:06:28.178 --> 01:06:31.199]  And right now, a small amount is available to my listeners.
[01:06:31.439 --> 01:06:39.703]  Keep in mind, shipments get filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you take immediate action by going to 321relief.com.
[01:06:39.903 --> 01:06:40.563]  And the best part?
[01:06:40.783 --> 01:06:42.764]  My listeners pay absolutely nothing today.
[01:06:42.944 --> 01:06:43.945]  Simply go to 321release.com or call 815-259-4552 for details.
[01:06:43.985 --> 01:06:45.647]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:45.827 --> 01:06:47.468]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:14.534 --> 01:07:15.795]  Wah-wah!
[01:07:17.376 --> 01:07:18.277]  Great music, huh?
[01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:25.823]  That which does not kill you only makes you stronger.
[01:07:27.625 --> 01:07:29.086]  When I was young, that didn't make a lot of sense.
[01:07:29.106 --> 01:07:31.027]  The older I get, I realize just how true it is.
[01:07:31.167 --> 01:07:36.612]  All the bad things that happened to me, all the adversity, all the things I saw that happened, it all made me stronger.
[01:07:38.081 --> 01:07:38.982]  It all made me better.
[01:07:39.062 --> 01:07:43.468]  I mean, I hated the things that happened to me, and I hated the things that scarred me, and the things in life.
[01:07:43.488 --> 01:07:48.335]  But I think back on all those, those were all strengthening procedures.
[01:07:48.375 --> 01:07:49.817]  Those were all things that happened.
[01:07:50.838 --> 01:07:50.978]  And...
[01:07:52.148 --> 01:07:53.309]  It's the same thing with plants.
[01:07:53.469 --> 01:07:57.151]  You get plants that don't get wind on them, that don't get a little bit of stress.
[01:07:57.191 --> 01:07:58.172]  They end up being a lot weaker.
[01:07:58.212 --> 01:07:59.173]  Their fruit's not as good.
[01:07:59.633 --> 01:08:00.834]  I don't know why I threw that out there.
[01:08:00.854 --> 01:08:08.439]  The point is that this Ron Paul movement, this liberty movement, this freedom awakening is only one more step, as Ron Paul has said, one more focal point.
[01:08:08.919 --> 01:08:11.961]  They're dragging Dr. Rand Paul out from his patients right now.
[01:08:12.001 --> 01:08:17.365]  He's been gracious enough to give us part of his lunch hour, and so John should be popping in momentarily when we get him.
[01:08:18.041 --> 01:08:20.262]  The Ron Paul campaign just called us during the break again.
[01:08:20.482 --> 01:08:26.546]  Jesse, they're now doing the TV interview, and he should be on with us at 40 after.
[01:08:26.566 --> 01:08:30.769]  40 after is when Ron Paul is supposedly on.
[01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:33.910]  As many times as they've called us, he's pretty much for sure going to be on the show.
[01:08:33.930 --> 01:08:34.891]  I don't want to have to knock on...
[01:08:36.338 --> 01:08:36.899]  Would with that.
[01:08:36.939 --> 01:08:38.521]  But again, Congressman Paul's office just called.
[01:08:38.541 --> 01:08:39.983]  He should be on at 40 after with us.
[01:08:40.503 --> 01:08:43.848]  That's right when our surprise guest is on, but they can just be on together, I guess.
[01:08:44.528 --> 01:08:51.957]  But popping in to give us his take, his analysis on what happened in Iowa last night is Dr. Rand Paul, obviously named after...
[01:08:53.383 --> 01:08:59.169]  I'm Rand, and we are really honored to have him on with us to give us his take on what happened in Iowa.
[01:08:59.449 --> 01:09:00.830]  Ron Paul in double digits.
[01:09:00.850 --> 01:09:02.312]  Giuliani sinking to nothing.
[01:09:02.632 --> 01:09:08.879]  And now there's no way Fox can have Giuliani at 4% in the Fox debate with Ron Paul at 10.
[01:09:09.559 --> 01:09:13.063]  And trending to get probably second or third place in New Hampshire.
[01:09:13.323 --> 01:09:14.244]  Could even get first place.
[01:09:14.504 --> 01:09:15.866]  Dr. Paul, thanks for joining us.
[01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:17.441]  Great to be here.
[01:09:17.461 --> 01:09:20.963]  You know, you're assuming that Fox is going to use some objective standard.
[01:09:20.983 --> 01:09:22.724]  What do you think of the odds of that happening?
[01:09:23.024 --> 01:09:24.445]  I thought they were fair and balanced, though.
[01:09:24.465 --> 01:09:25.345]  Yeah.
[01:09:26.046 --> 01:09:27.166]  We'll see about that.
[01:09:27.366 --> 01:09:32.910]  But, yeah, I think there's not a whole lot of justification for having Giuliani now and not having my father.
[01:09:32.930 --> 01:09:35.831]  You know, there's no justification.
[01:09:36.252 --> 01:09:39.333]  Give us your take, sir, on what happened last night in Iowa.
[01:09:40.754 --> 01:09:41.675]  I think not bad.
[01:09:41.695 --> 01:09:45.517]  You know, I always have had higher hopes for New Hampshire than Iowa.
[01:09:46.024 --> 01:09:52.385]  Ten percent, though, is still a significant amount of Republicans, you know, wanting a significant change in their government.
[01:09:53.525 --> 01:10:02.587]  The other thing that I thought was interesting, when you look at the people who voted, if they classified themselves as independents, we actually won that vote.
[01:10:03.147 --> 01:10:08.388]  We had 29 percent of the independents, and that was the highest percentage of any candidate from independents.
[01:10:08.948 --> 01:10:15.309]  And that bodes well for New Hampshire because, you know, they say 40 to 45 percent of the electorate is independent up there.
[01:10:15.945 --> 01:10:23.227]  If we can get a decent amount of them to come over to the Republican primary, I think we'll win that independent vote, which could make the difference.
[01:10:24.608 --> 01:10:32.510]  That is the big difference, is they can swing whichever way they want and vote wherever they want in New Hampshire, which is a more constitutional system, isn't it?
[01:10:33.170 --> 01:10:41.273]  Yeah, the only problem, though, is that the sort of the bad news out of Iowa is that there were 250,000 Democrats who voted and only about 125,000 Republicans.
[01:10:44.986 --> 01:10:46.548]  And I think there's two messages there.
[01:10:46.688 --> 01:10:52.414]  One message is that the war has become so unpopular, anybody who's opposing the war, if you're an independent,
[01:10:52.995 --> 01:10:55.517]  I think a lot of them are going to the Democrat side.
[01:10:55.817 --> 01:11:06.123]  Oh my gosh, that's an amazing point I hadn't really consciously thought of or discussed, is that absolutely, Ron Paul's winning with independents in polls, but that's not translating as it should.
[01:11:06.683 --> 01:11:08.964]  Democrats, you should all vote for Ron Paul.
[01:11:09.225 --> 01:11:13.467]  Your entire leadership, Obama, all of them, Hillary, are pro-war.
[01:11:13.527 --> 01:11:14.548]  What is wrong with you?
[01:11:14.848 --> 01:11:19.731]  Yeah, that's the thing, is you've got to motivate independents to come to the Republican primary, and for a year...
[01:11:20.393 --> 01:11:30.060]  The pundits have been saying, and I'm kind of intending to believe them, that the Republican Party is such a mess that independents are trending towards the Democrat side.
[01:11:30.421 --> 01:11:44.431]  But the other part of that argument, while that might not help us in the primary, it's an argument for why they have to decide that they have to do something with Ron Paul within the Republican Party because the Republican Party is going down in flames.
[01:11:44.891 --> 01:11:46.933]  It's getting smaller and smaller and smaller.
[01:11:47.389 --> 01:11:52.633]  Because they're not only promoting an endless war in Iraq, they're now promoting a new war in Iran.
[01:11:52.673 --> 01:11:53.533]  They don't get it.
[01:11:53.593 --> 01:11:55.254]  It's destroying the Republican Party.
[01:11:57.596 --> 01:11:58.356]  Oh, I agree with you.
[01:11:58.376 --> 01:11:58.857]  Continue.
[01:11:59.757 --> 01:12:04.781]  Well, I just think that that's the real key to our success, and I've been saying it for six months in New Hampshire.
[01:12:04.801 --> 01:12:06.582]  The key to the success is independence.
[01:12:07.122 --> 01:12:11.325]  The good news is that other states allow independence to vote in the primary, too.
[01:12:11.845 --> 01:12:17.109]  I don't know this for certain, but I have been told that in South Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee,
[01:12:17.859 --> 01:12:19.780]  Independence can vote in either primary.
[01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:25.402]  And so what we have to do is build a movement that has new people coming to the party.
[01:12:25.902 --> 01:12:32.244]  If the election is based only on traditional Republicans, 10% could be the high water of the movement.
[01:12:32.625 --> 01:12:35.226]  And 10% is not a small number, but that could be the high water.
[01:12:35.726 --> 01:12:41.328]  If you bring in enough new people, you can trend up high enough to maybe knock somebody off.
[01:12:41.368 --> 01:12:46.910]  And that's where we really hope in New Hampshire is we've got to motivate the independents and get them to come to our side.
[01:12:49.284 --> 01:12:57.141]  Dr. Rand Paul joins the son of Ron Paul involved with the campaign, speaking at many of the major rallies and filling in as a powerful surrogate for his father.
[01:12:58.114 --> 01:13:03.616]  Your father, in the interviews I've seen, he's joining us, coming up in about 30 minutes, reportedly, is pleased with the 10%.
[01:13:03.696 --> 01:13:08.739]  In fact, he said last night on Larry King Live, when they finally aired it, that he'd be happy with fourth or fifth place.
[01:13:08.779 --> 01:13:11.940]  And, you know, I agree because of the nature of the Iowa caucuses.
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:22.124]  What internal polling are you getting, or what's your general feel, Dr. Paul, on what place you think he's going to get in New Hampshire, and what
[01:13:27.001 --> 01:13:42.049]  I think as long as we continue to have a significant showing and that's close to at least the 10% mark, I think that it continues to show that we have a significant force out there.
[01:13:42.729 --> 01:13:46.671]  I think if you're showing up like Duncan Hunter didn't even show up.
[01:13:46.871 --> 01:13:47.451]  He was still at 0%.
[01:13:48.272 --> 01:13:52.434]  Then you have no real business continuing no matter what you have going.
[01:13:52.913 --> 01:13:56.676]  We have a significant following out there, not only represented by the money being raised.
[01:13:57.256 --> 01:14:05.883]  Our people don't want him out of the race at all because they want him to continue to fight for that message because no one else is championing the Constitution.
[01:14:05.923 --> 01:14:12.748]  No one else is championing limited government, balanced budgets, and not fighting unconstitutional wars.
[01:14:13.108 --> 01:14:15.009]  So I think there is no other voice for that.
[01:14:15.029 --> 01:14:17.531]  And I still think we will go all the way to the convention.
[01:14:17.551 --> 01:14:19.553]  You know, we picked up two delegates yesterday.
[01:14:20.383 --> 01:14:22.845]  For the 10%, you know, McCain only picked up three.
[01:14:22.865 --> 01:14:29.091]  So, I mean, we're only one behind, you know, both McCain and, I think, Thompson in delegate count.
[01:14:29.371 --> 01:14:38.259]  Rand Paul, I don't think that we can overstate how big a deal it is that Ron Paul got more than double the votes of Giuliani.
[01:14:38.599 --> 01:14:41.201]  I mean, he was the frontrunner just three months ago in their darling.
[01:14:41.942 --> 01:14:45.025]  Yeah, and you can still see how it's a little unfair on the coverage.
[01:14:45.065 --> 01:14:47.847]  Giuliani got two stations last night cut.
[01:14:48.354 --> 01:14:55.136]  Well, regardless, Rand, we've all talked about this on and off air, but can you restate it with any other...
[01:15:11.138 --> 01:15:13.820]  You know, tidbits added in from your perspective, Doctor.
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:15.621]  We win regardless.
[01:15:16.121 --> 01:15:17.342]  Congressman's in the arena.
[01:15:17.402 --> 01:15:18.703]  The people have joined him.
[01:15:19.123 --> 01:15:20.344]  The people are rising up.
[01:15:20.384 --> 01:15:21.885]  We're growing a liberty movement.
[01:15:22.085 --> 01:15:23.786]  People are learning about the Federal Reserve.
[01:15:23.826 --> 01:15:25.167]  They're learning about the free market.
[01:15:25.367 --> 01:15:27.268]  They're rediscovering the Constitution.
[01:15:27.948 --> 01:15:31.090]  Doctor, can you comment on how we've already won?
[01:15:31.311 --> 01:15:35.533]  I mean, some people are pessimistic and go, well, he might not win, or they might cheat, or so what?
[01:15:35.593 --> 01:15:36.674]  We've got to get in the fight.
[01:15:38.455 --> 01:15:53.062]  Yeah, it's always been about the movement, it's always about the ideas, and it is always nice to win elections, it's always nice to do well in elections, but it's a bigger issue than just the election.
[01:15:53.482 --> 01:15:59.185]  But we still look at it as also the winning, and we plan on doing everything possible.
[01:15:59.685 --> 01:16:01.726]  I'm going to be in New Hampshire for the next five days.
[01:16:02.658 --> 01:16:06.760]  I've been told that part of what I'll be doing is escorting Barry Goldwater Jr.
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:10.181]  is going to be there in town to endorse my father in person.
[01:16:12.402 --> 01:16:15.363]  We feel like we're going to get an upsurge in New Hampshire.
[01:16:15.383 --> 01:16:18.264]  They've been working long and hard.
[01:16:18.304 --> 01:16:20.705]  We have a good campaign organization in New Hampshire.
[01:16:21.125 --> 01:16:23.046]  We're still hoping for really good things in New Hampshire.
[01:16:25.439 --> 01:16:42.808]  Rand, the only reason I bring up the fact that we've already won is obviously we're all shooting to win the campaign, but I just wanted to sink in for some people that got bummed out last night by double-digit and dwarfing Giuliani and, you know, coming ahead of, what, three or four of the candidates, you know, being in the middle of the pack.
[01:16:44.009 --> 01:16:49.132]  The fact is that the mainstream media has said that the criteria is the top five are, quote, first tier.
[01:16:49.452 --> 01:16:53.554]  That's what ABC News and Fox News said they were going to put in their debates, and then they just...
[01:16:54.204 --> 01:16:58.746]  Yeah, and I think you also have to look at it from the perspective that nine months ago,
[01:17:22.133 --> 01:17:36.197]  We started out with virtually zero name recognition, and now I would say that 25, 30, 40 percent of the country knows the name, if not more, and they also know the issues and the ideas.
[01:17:36.237 --> 01:17:49.581]  They know that you don't always have to be a Republican and be for endless war, that you can be a Republican and believe that the Constitution protects civil liberties, that you can be a Republican and believe that
[01:17:50.180 --> 01:17:53.001]  A judge needs to have a warrant before he comes into your house.
[01:17:53.101 --> 01:17:54.702]  I mean, basic freedoms.
[01:17:54.802 --> 01:17:59.364]  You don't have to be a Republican and believe in no constitutional restraints.
[01:17:59.764 --> 01:18:06.107]  And that's what the Republican Party has been evolving into without my father's influence.
[01:18:06.807 --> 01:18:11.709]  And the problem is there's nothing better on the Democrat side because if you're on the Democrat side, you're right.
[01:18:11.729 --> 01:18:12.890]  They're not very good on the war.
[01:18:12.910 --> 01:18:14.870]  They're not very good on civil liberties.
[01:18:15.251 --> 01:18:18.552]  They're definitely not very good on economic liberties or private property.
[01:18:19.338 --> 01:18:23.459]  So really, our hope is to grow movement out of this, and there are good things coming out of this.
[01:18:23.499 --> 01:18:27.300]  There's a young man up in New Hampshire I think is going to run for office.
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:36.903]  I've heard of several other people around the country who consider Ron Paul to be their hero and to be the message that they want to promote when they run for office.
[01:18:37.103 --> 01:18:38.664]  Dr. Paul, if you've got to go, that's fine.
[01:18:38.704 --> 01:18:41.085]  If not, a quick break and five more minutes on the other side.
[01:18:41.245 --> 01:18:41.785]  It's your call.
[01:18:43.045 --> 01:18:44.349]  You're getting ready to have my dad.
[01:18:44.369 --> 01:18:48.460]  I don't want to steal his thunder, so I will take a rain check and talk to you soon.
[01:18:48.581 --> 01:18:49.343]  Thank you, Dr. Paul.
[01:18:49.423 --> 01:18:49.684]  All right.
[01:18:53.362 --> 01:18:54.343]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:18:54.423 --> 01:18:59.206]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:18:59.366 --> 01:19:07.171]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:19:07.431 --> 01:19:12.775]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:19:12.995 --> 01:19:13.495]  We're good to go.
[01:19:38.875 --> 01:19:39.536]  Thanks for watching!
[01:19:52.777 --> 01:19:54.459]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[01:19:54.759 --> 01:19:58.263]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:19:58.383 --> 01:20:00.405]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:20:00.846 --> 01:20:03.589]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:20:03.929 --> 01:20:09.415]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[01:20:09.696 --> 01:20:13.640]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:18.901]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[01:20:19.181 --> 01:20:21.962]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.
[01:20:22.242 --> 01:20:29.143]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded or screened in super high quality directly to your computer or iPhone and shared with others.
[01:20:29.523 --> 01:20:35.384]  Thousands of special video reports from tainted vaccines to martial law can be found in this online video library.
[01:20:35.544 --> 01:20:40.065]  My weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[01:20:41.297 --> 01:20:44.658]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[01:20:44.698 --> 01:20:48.399]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[01:21:04.344 --> 01:21:09.427]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[01:21:09.727 --> 01:21:15.310]  People who alkalize to water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[01:21:15.631 --> 01:21:21.634]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[01:21:21.854 --> 01:21:25.396]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[01:21:25.656 --> 01:21:30.159]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[01:21:30.459 --> 01:21:31.220]  Do your part.
[01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:33.783]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[01:21:34.123 --> 01:21:42.993]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.
[01:21:43.354 --> 01:21:49.520]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to alkavision.com.
[01:21:49.821 --> 01:21:51.222]  Again, that's alkavision.com.
[01:21:52.756 --> 01:21:53.577]  I am blood pressure.
[01:22:16.854 --> 01:22:17.515]  We're good to go.
[01:22:36.777 --> 01:22:37.278]  by calling 866-295-5305.
[01:22:37.298 --> 01:22:37.598]  That's 866-295-5305.
[01:22:37.618 --> 01:22:39.619]  Or order online at hbextract.com.
[01:22:39.679 --> 01:22:42.360]  Heart and Body Extract, 866-295-5305 or hbextract.com.
[01:23:01.876 --> 01:23:05.757]  All right, we're back live.
[01:23:05.877 --> 01:23:08.098]  Yvette in New Jersey.
[01:23:08.118 --> 01:23:10.759]  Yvette, you're on the air.
[01:23:11.039 --> 01:23:12.099]  Go ahead.
[01:23:32.236 --> 01:23:33.537]  Hello, Alex.
[01:23:33.757 --> 01:23:34.959]  Hi.
[01:23:34.979 --> 01:23:35.019]  Hi.
[01:23:35.099 --> 01:23:38.202]  Thanks so much for sharing your insights about Iowa.
[01:23:38.222 --> 01:23:39.963]  That was very encouraging.
[01:23:40.904 --> 01:23:46.729]  And I just wanted to share also about the support Mike Huckabee has by so many Christians.
[01:23:47.790 --> 01:23:50.653]  There's a pastor named Pastor Chuck Baldwin.
[01:23:51.013 --> 01:23:52.375]  He's a minister in Florida.
[01:23:52.415 --> 01:23:53.015]  No, great guy.
[01:23:53.035 --> 01:23:53.596]  We've interviewed him.
[01:23:53.616 --> 01:23:53.756]  Yeah.
[01:23:54.524 --> 01:23:55.125]  Oh, okay.
[01:23:55.245 --> 01:23:59.087]  Yeah, he's been trying to warn Christians to beware of Mike Huckabee.
[01:23:59.127 --> 01:24:02.049]  He's written articles about him on his website.
[01:24:02.069 --> 01:24:09.674]  He even went to Iowa to talk to the pastors there, and unfortunately it doesn't seem like that message reached everyone.
[01:24:09.774 --> 01:24:12.436]  Like, it didn't reach the other ministers in the state.
[01:24:13.037 --> 01:24:15.278]  Look, those ministers, most of them work for FEMA.
[01:24:15.658 --> 01:24:18.020]  That's come out in the news, as we told you, most of the big ones.
[01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:19.681]  And it's just a government op.
[01:24:20.462 --> 01:24:20.862]  Yeah.
[01:24:20.882 --> 01:24:23.844]  A lot of those guys are on foreign government payrolls, and that's come out in the news.
[01:24:24.789 --> 01:24:37.360]  Well, that sort of explains why when I, well, I stopped going to church, sorry to say, but the last time I went there, I tried to talk to people, and I was pretty much laughed at until I was a nut.
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:37.720]  No, no, no.
[01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:38.721]  They want to feel good.
[01:24:38.761 --> 01:24:41.203]  The average church-going American, on average.
[01:24:41.758 --> 01:24:42.138]  I think so.
[01:25:08.582 --> 01:25:16.286]  It's just amazing the type of stuff they do, and they're just there to neutralize the public.
[01:25:16.326 --> 01:25:17.247]  I appreciate your call.
[01:25:17.547 --> 01:25:20.468]  Let's talk to Troy in Illinois.
[01:25:20.628 --> 01:25:21.889]  We've got a big guest coming up, by the way.
[01:25:22.229 --> 01:25:22.950]  Troy, you're on the air.
[01:25:22.970 --> 01:25:23.350]  Go ahead.
[01:25:23.370 --> 01:25:25.071]  Yeah, hi.
[01:25:25.111 --> 01:25:26.031]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:25:26.211 --> 01:25:26.512]  Good.
[01:25:27.992 --> 01:25:32.575]  My question to you was, I'm totally about Ron Paul.
[01:25:32.835 --> 01:25:36.137]  I'm still wondering a couple things.
[01:25:37.731 --> 01:25:43.734]  Being in the medical field, how does he feel about the vaccines and the vaccinations?
[01:25:43.854 --> 01:25:52.658]  He has supported legislation at the state level to not try to have them force it on people and to make them back off.
[01:25:52.738 --> 01:25:55.440]  He also doesn't want to give vaccine makers immunity.
[01:25:57.061 --> 01:25:59.922]  We've had health experts on who cover his policies on that.
[01:26:00.322 --> 01:26:01.643]  He is for alternative medicine.
[01:26:02.003 --> 01:26:02.843]  He is for liberty.
[01:26:03.844 --> 01:26:04.004]  Right.
[01:26:04.611 --> 01:26:04.811]  Right.
[01:26:05.131 --> 01:26:05.411]  Awesome.
[01:26:05.431 --> 01:26:10.334]  Because I didn't hear a lot about that as far as this, because he is in the medical field.
[01:26:11.434 --> 01:26:32.223]  Also, I had one question for you as far as, you know, you state that as far as it goes with, you know, worrying about yourself when it comes to stuff, you state that that
[01:26:32.728 --> 01:26:40.455]  You're not too concerned as far as your well-being when it comes to speaking out, but how do you feel about your family?
[01:26:40.595 --> 01:26:48.082]  Like, I have a young child and everything else, and I'm curious how you feel.
[01:26:49.103 --> 01:26:49.663]  Sure, sure.
[01:26:49.683 --> 01:26:51.785]  Let me let you go and answer that question, okay?
[01:26:52.706 --> 01:26:53.907]  I do care about myself.
[01:26:54.728 --> 01:26:55.489]  I don't want to die.
[01:26:55.729 --> 01:26:57.751]  I don't want to get thrown in prison for a false charge.
[01:26:58.211 --> 01:26:59.092]  The new order does all that.
[01:27:00.302 --> 01:27:08.946]  But I realize that the danger is much greater to just let them have their way with us and let them get away with everything and never challenge them.
[01:27:09.026 --> 01:27:13.668]  I mean, would it have been better to fight Hitler early on?
[01:27:15.069 --> 01:27:15.909]  Most Germans didn't.
[01:27:15.929 --> 01:27:18.130]  They didn't like him at first, but they went along with him.
[01:27:19.390 --> 01:27:25.713]  Or would it have been better just to go through 20 million dead Germans and the whole country bombed into a slag heap and occupied by the Soviets?
[01:27:27.194 --> 01:27:27.614]  Half of it.
[01:27:29.565 --> 01:27:31.165]  And under socialist bondage today.
[01:27:32.146 --> 01:27:33.426]  I mean, what's better?
[01:27:35.466 --> 01:27:39.688]  So, being at the tip of the spear is a great responsibility.
[01:27:41.088 --> 01:27:44.049]  As they say, great power becomes great responsibility.
[01:27:45.529 --> 01:27:46.909]  And I try to do a better job every day.
[01:27:46.949 --> 01:27:47.589]  I try to work hard.
[01:27:47.609 --> 01:27:51.030]  I try to realize the serious nature of what I do.
[01:27:51.951 --> 01:27:53.651]  The point is, I've just said I can't live in fear.
[01:27:53.691 --> 01:27:57.692]  I had to turn loose of... I still take precautions, you know, basic ones.
[01:27:58.314 --> 01:27:59.515]  For myself and my family.
[01:28:00.315 --> 01:28:11.440]  But my children are in greater danger, and my family's in greater danger, if this system wins than if I just stand up and fight them.
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:12.920]  Okay?
[01:28:13.521 --> 01:28:17.582]  And also, the enemy knows that when you're afraid of them and when that will affect you, then they come.
[01:28:18.263 --> 01:28:20.784]  But they know, and I've been through tests, believe me.
[01:28:20.884 --> 01:28:22.024]  They tested me years ago.
[01:28:22.505 --> 01:28:24.345]  But they know when you just go, do your worst, you know,
[01:28:26.218 --> 01:28:27.319]  I'm not saying bring it on.
[01:28:27.359 --> 01:28:28.880]  I'm just saying I've got to do what I've got to do.
[01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:29.821]  I've got to do the right thing.
[01:28:30.221 --> 01:28:30.981]  I've got to stand up.
[01:28:31.922 --> 01:28:35.504]  I don't sit there and tease them and say, like a bull, come get me, come get me.
[01:28:35.544 --> 01:28:40.047]  I just say, hey, have a soul, do the right thing, don't be evil, but do what you have to.
[01:28:43.990 --> 01:28:44.931]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.371 --> 01:28:46.972]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.893 --> 01:28:50.615]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.735 --> 01:28:54.616]  Storable food.
[01:28:54.836 --> 01:28:55.696]  Storable food.
[01:28:55.876 --> 01:28:59.879]  HempUSA.org has an inexpensive, nutritionally dense, high-frequency food.

[01:31:57.658 --> 01:32:15.650]  A couple days ago, I got an email from a listener saying, Hey, Alex, do you know who Big Daddy Don Garlis is?
[01:32:16.619 --> 01:32:17.740]  And I said, absolutely.
[01:32:18.260 --> 01:32:20.181]  Growing up in Dallas, drag racing was big.
[01:32:20.201 --> 01:32:25.185]  I remember many times watching ABC Wide World Sports and the rest of it and watching the drag race.
[01:32:25.205 --> 01:32:26.746]  It even went out to a few when I was younger.
[01:32:27.586 --> 01:32:31.669]  And he is synonymous with drag racing.
[01:32:32.329 --> 01:32:33.370]  Big Daddy Don Garlitson.
[01:32:33.390 --> 01:32:39.354]  In fact, Garlitson has been dubbed the king of dragsters and can be considered the patriarch of top fuel drag racing.
[01:32:40.074 --> 01:32:40.795]  We're good to go.
[01:32:40.815 --> 01:32:41.255]  We're good to go.
[01:33:04.881 --> 01:33:06.963]  And got brass ones the size of bowling balls.
[01:33:07.483 --> 01:33:12.767]  But his wonderful 25 reasons that he has endorsed Ron Paul.
[01:33:13.368 --> 01:33:15.089]  And I wanted to go over a few of those with him.
[01:33:15.109 --> 01:33:20.213]  He wants to get rid of the Federal Reserve, income tax, get us out of the North American Union, Law of the Sea Treaty.
[01:33:20.794 --> 01:33:25.357]  He's a proven fundraiser, wants to get rid of the, not a member of the CFR, Prolateral Commission.
[01:33:25.858 --> 01:33:29.381]  I didn't know Big Daddy Don Garlitz knew about the New World Order.
[01:33:29.421 --> 01:33:30.301]  Thanks for coming on, sir.
[01:33:31.442 --> 01:33:32.263]  Well, thank you.
[01:33:32.283 --> 01:33:33.364]  It's a pleasure to be here.
[01:33:33.928 --> 01:33:42.095]  Well, you know, I keep up with all that kind of stuff, world events, because all of those things affect you ultimately, and of course your children and your grandchildren.
[01:33:42.816 --> 01:33:44.497]  And a lot of people don't think like that.
[01:33:44.557 --> 01:33:47.580]  They think, well, whatever's happening today is all that matters, you know.
[01:33:48.020 --> 01:33:50.142]  It's actually a little more complicated than that.
[01:33:51.002 --> 01:33:51.583]  Absolutely.
[01:33:51.603 --> 01:33:56.147]  Ron Paul has been a guy that's been really, he's a Constitutionist.
[01:33:56.187 --> 01:33:57.388]  That's what's important.
[01:33:57.428 --> 01:34:02.132]  You know, the American Constitution is one of the greatest documents ever written, and
[01:34:02.794 --> 01:34:08.016]  It was written particularly to keep government from getting so oppressive.
[01:34:08.557 --> 01:34:12.658]  And that's why Washington doesn't like it.
[01:34:14.539 --> 01:34:15.220]  Absolutely.
[01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:17.501]  When did you discover Ron Paul?
[01:34:17.521 --> 01:34:18.221]  Or I should go back.
[01:34:18.261 --> 01:34:19.862]  When did you start waking up to the New World Order?
[01:34:19.902 --> 01:34:21.602]  When did you discover Ron Paul?
[01:34:21.742 --> 01:34:23.863]  And what are some of the other reasons you're supporting him?
[01:34:24.724 --> 01:34:29.126]  Well, way back in the 60s, I began to understand as I...
[01:34:30.228 --> 01:34:33.469]  Turned into my 30s, you know, my early 30s.
[01:34:33.889 --> 01:34:38.511]  I began to realize there was a lot more going on than you read in the regular newspapers.
[01:34:38.551 --> 01:34:42.152]  And that's when I started studying about all of the different things that were happening.
[01:34:42.172 --> 01:34:49.854]  The Illuminati, the Bilderbergers, the New World Order, the Federal Reserve, the Central Banking System, all those things.
[01:34:50.114 --> 01:34:51.275]  They're all tied together.
[01:34:52.095 --> 01:34:57.497]  And I just ran into Ron Paul because he had a...
[01:34:59.145 --> 01:35:11.454]  A service that you could buy gold and silver through a company that he was involved in, Ron Paul Investments, which I think he's since sold that, but he still stays close to the people.
[01:35:12.135 --> 01:35:13.676]  And that was way back.
[01:35:13.716 --> 01:35:14.637]  That's 20 years ago.
[01:35:14.657 --> 01:35:16.959]  And he was a hard money guy then.
[01:35:17.039 --> 01:35:21.342]  He believed that the money should not be printed just at random.
[01:35:22.052 --> 01:35:23.553]  That it should have some kind of backing.
[01:35:23.693 --> 01:35:24.754]  Well, look at Americans.
[01:35:24.834 --> 01:35:30.998]  We've lost, in the last four years, 30-40% in our purchasing power.
[01:35:31.038 --> 01:35:35.700]  The dollar's been debased by more than half, and the yuppies haven't figured this out yet, Don.
[01:35:35.740 --> 01:35:37.041]  What's going to happen when they find out?
[01:35:38.102 --> 01:35:40.103]  Well, that's exactly what's going to happen.
[01:35:40.123 --> 01:35:49.749]  You know, not too long ago, in the front page of the USA Today, they were talking about the government was discussing with Ben Bernanke
[01:35:50.296 --> 01:35:52.517]  The new chairman of the Federal Reserve.
[01:35:53.338 --> 01:36:02.423]  What were they going to do about this $47 trillion, that's with a T, that they owed government employees for pensions?
[01:36:03.403 --> 01:36:06.085]  And, you know, that's an astronomical number.
[01:36:06.585 --> 01:36:09.606]  Well, Bernanke looked them right in the eyes because he didn't cause it.
[01:36:09.666 --> 01:36:11.147]  He was the new kid on the block.
[01:36:11.427 --> 01:36:14.329]  He said, you boys always got the printing press.
[01:36:14.809 --> 01:36:17.951]  And I'll tell you what, their eyes got big when he told them that.
[01:36:19.449 --> 01:36:26.295]  And now the acceleration of the devaluation is ballooning, as it always does, in these systems.
[01:36:26.355 --> 01:36:28.316]  Let's go through some of the points.
[01:36:28.496 --> 01:36:34.221]  Big Daddy Don Garlitz joins us, the king of drag racing, supporting Ron Paul, known him for 20 years.
[01:36:34.281 --> 01:36:36.102]  Wow, that is just amazing.
[01:36:36.142 --> 01:36:38.484]  This whole story of the Ron Paul revolution just gets better and better.
[01:36:38.724 --> 01:36:42.227]  But before we get into some of the reasons you're supporting Ron Paul, I think 10% in Iowa...
[01:36:43.715 --> 01:36:49.237]  More than double what Giuliani got is amazing, and I think they should let him back into that Fox News debate.
[01:36:49.257 --> 01:36:50.137]  There's five places.
[01:36:50.177 --> 01:36:51.078]  He got fifth place.
[01:36:51.558 --> 01:36:53.839]  The polls are showing he's going to get second or third in New Hampshire.
[01:36:53.859 --> 01:36:54.759]  Shouldn't he be in that debate?
[01:36:55.660 --> 01:36:56.260]  Absolutely.
[01:36:56.320 --> 01:36:57.720]  I mean, this is the media.
[01:36:57.780 --> 01:37:04.503]  The media doesn't like Ron Paul because the media does not want the country to return to the Constitution.
[01:37:04.543 --> 01:37:05.923]  They like it just like it is.
[01:37:06.464 --> 01:37:12.746]  And the reason for that is the media is controlled by the same people who actually control Washington.
[01:37:14.185 --> 01:37:15.766]  And I'll tell you a little something that happened.
[01:37:15.806 --> 01:37:31.030]  Right after the towers were hit by the terrorists, they asked Bush, President Bush, in a press conference, Mr. President, what would have happened if one of those planes had hit the White House and killed you and Cheney, simultaneously?
[01:37:31.531 --> 01:37:42.534]  And Mr. Bush said, not to worry, he said there's a secret government operating 24-7 that would have taken right over, and nothing would have went wrong, everything would have been fine.
[01:37:42.921 --> 01:37:48.564]  Boy, he never mentioned that again because a lot of people would like to know, who is this secret government?
[01:37:48.824 --> 01:37:49.744]  Who appoints them?
[01:37:49.784 --> 01:37:50.745]  Where do they come from?
[01:37:51.105 --> 01:37:52.025]  Where are they?
[01:37:52.425 --> 01:37:53.906]  We want to know more about them.
[01:37:54.486 --> 01:37:58.148]  We never heard another word, but that came right out of...
[01:37:58.755 --> 01:38:00.136]  President Bush's mouth.
[01:38:00.217 --> 01:38:07.544]  Well, we know the international bankers own both parties, and Bush in his presidential directive 51 has now said he's over Congress and continuity of government.
[01:38:07.964 --> 01:38:10.587]  He's planning to pass that power on down to Hillary.
[01:38:10.627 --> 01:38:12.209]  We're going into the North American Union.
[01:38:12.249 --> 01:38:18.074]  Can you talk about this international syndicate, the NAU, for those that aren't aware of what it is, Big Daddy?
[01:38:19.095 --> 01:38:19.596]  Well, sure.
[01:38:19.636 --> 01:38:22.319]  I mean, they want to join Canada, Mexico.
[01:38:23.027 --> 01:38:30.170]  And the United States and take down the borders and allow the people to go back and forth freely and, of course, trade and everything.
[01:38:30.630 --> 01:38:33.771]  And, of course, we have some ulterior motives for that.
[01:38:34.251 --> 01:38:45.275]  The United States would actually gain some benefit from it in that we'd have access to all the oil that's in Mexico and then the oil sands that are in Canada.
[01:38:45.655 --> 01:38:51.017]  But the bad part would be we would be then completely overrun
[01:38:51.519 --> 01:38:56.000]  With the people from Mexico who have lived a life of poverty.
[01:38:56.020 --> 01:38:57.721]  See, that's a terrible country down there.
[01:38:57.761 --> 01:38:59.922]  You know, it's practically a dictatorship.
[01:39:00.402 --> 01:39:02.883]  And they got nothing for the people.
[01:39:02.903 --> 01:39:04.283]  You know, they don't even care about the people.
[01:39:04.303 --> 01:39:08.404]  And we've got a socialist welfare system that the illegals and others have already bankrupt.
[01:39:08.424 --> 01:39:09.925]  Can you imagine another $30 million?
[01:39:10.325 --> 01:39:11.725]  Well, exactly.
[01:39:11.785 --> 01:39:12.766]  We'd get every bit of that.
[01:39:12.826 --> 01:39:16.727]  I'll tell you who else would be hurt really bad by that is Canada.
[01:39:16.947 --> 01:39:20.628]  Because Canada is a country that, even though it has socialized medicine...
[01:39:21.019 --> 01:39:26.464]  It doesn't have a big population, and it's got lots of open spaces and lots of natural resources.
[01:39:27.064 --> 01:39:30.227]  And Mexico and the United States will suck that right up.
[01:39:32.248 --> 01:39:36.372]  And the global interests that help set up these new systems, they get to write the new rules.
[01:39:36.772 --> 01:39:39.514]  A lot of liberals and people say, well, global government, that's the next step.
[01:39:40.115 --> 01:39:42.537]  Well, I'm against global government because it's a firewall system.
[01:39:44.685 --> 01:39:58.188]  It's a small stretch than to go from the North American Union and just include South America in that, and then another small jump and you've got the European Union and we could join.
[01:39:58.768 --> 01:40:00.408]  They're headed for global government.
[01:40:00.448 --> 01:40:03.949]  That's exactly where it's all going, and the end of solvency.
[01:40:03.969 --> 01:40:09.990]  Of course, in this mix is naturally we lose our firearms.
[01:40:11.775 --> 01:40:20.240]  Well, they just passed another huge gun control bill to go after people for misdemeanors and psychological reasons, and the feds are going to control all that.
[01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:23.082]  The good news is, people are starting to wake up.
[01:40:23.202 --> 01:40:36.711]  Big Daddy Don Garlis, legendary king of drag racing, who's known Ron Paul for 20 years, could you have imagined that the Ron Paul revolution, really just up and running for six months, big time, started a year ago, would be this big, and that people...
[01:40:37.495 --> 01:40:44.658]  It would be rediscovering liberty, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and learning that there is a choice to the other two parties in socialism.
[01:40:45.878 --> 01:40:47.059]  It boggles my mind.
[01:40:47.159 --> 01:40:56.622]  When Ron Paul first said he was going to run for president, I thought, gosh, that will never get off the ground, because the people just aren't ready for that.
[01:40:56.682 --> 01:40:58.463]  But I was wrong about that.
[01:40:59.263 --> 01:41:00.844]  I have seen a groundswell...
[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:04.181]  Like I have never seen in my whole life.
[01:41:04.321 --> 01:41:05.342]  I'm 76 years old.
[01:41:05.402 --> 01:41:08.283]  I've never seen anything like this, such a groundswell.
[01:41:08.583 --> 01:41:17.087]  And what it tells me is the young people are waking up and realizing if they don't do something, they're not going to be inheriting much.
[01:41:17.507 --> 01:41:22.250]  This America... See, the world doesn't want America to be the greatest country on Earth.
[01:41:22.470 --> 01:41:25.251]  They want us to just be another third world power.
[01:41:25.691 --> 01:41:29.633]  And in that way, we'll be so much easier to be in the global community.
[01:41:30.069 --> 01:41:35.051]  See, as a world power like we are now, we would be dictating in the global community.
[01:41:35.091 --> 01:41:35.892]  They don't want that.
[01:41:38.013 --> 01:41:45.256]  Absolutely, and the really great thing about it is this exponential explosion, Big Daddy, is just the beginning from the trends I've seen.
[01:41:45.336 --> 01:41:47.837]  I did predict that it would be this big, and I...
[01:41:48.733 --> 01:41:51.135]  Challenge Ron, the many times he joins us once a month here.
[01:41:51.415 --> 01:41:53.997]  To Ron, as I know millions of others did.
[01:41:54.017 --> 01:41:59.401]  And I think the establishment is just now realizing that their facade is beginning to crack.
[01:41:59.441 --> 01:42:04.365]  And I want the listeners to know that if they'll really attack the facade of the New World Order, we could bring it down.
[01:42:04.425 --> 01:42:05.586]  I mean, you're a winner yourself.
[01:42:05.626 --> 01:42:06.347]  You're a go-getter.
[01:42:06.647 --> 01:42:08.328]  You're somebody that's taken action your whole life.
[01:42:08.348 --> 01:42:14.453]  Can you talk about just the mindset of winning and that believing that we can win is a big part of the battle?
[01:42:15.549 --> 01:42:16.149]  Yes, it is.
[01:42:16.369 --> 01:42:18.270]  It's a psychological thing.
[01:42:18.310 --> 01:42:19.870]  You set your mind on doing something.
[01:42:19.890 --> 01:42:22.090]  That's how I did all my cars.
[01:42:22.671 --> 01:42:27.412]  I set my mind on what I was going to do, and I imagined it before it actually happened.
[01:42:27.472 --> 01:42:35.853]  I imagined the car that I was going to build would be winning these national events, and I just kept that thought in my mind all the time, and that's what everybody's got to do.
[01:42:35.873 --> 01:42:38.034]  They've got to keep this thought in their mind.
[01:42:38.134 --> 01:42:39.714]  Ron Paul can win.
[01:42:40.114 --> 01:42:43.515]  We can overcome this thing, and especially as a group,
[01:42:44.125 --> 01:42:44.325]  I think.
[01:42:44.365 --> 01:42:44.786]  I think.
[01:43:08.024 --> 01:43:08.664]  Yes, it does.
[01:43:09.004 --> 01:43:09.465]  Yes, it does.
[01:43:09.505 --> 01:43:10.665]  That's absolutely right.
[01:43:10.785 --> 01:43:19.609]  And what this is going to show, no matter what happens or what the outcome is, is the power of the American people when they really get behind the project.
[01:43:20.690 --> 01:43:21.250]  Absolutely.
[01:43:21.290 --> 01:43:26.792]  Big Daddy, there are so many of these 25 points that you put out that folks can go to Big Daddy Don Garlitz and read about it.
[01:43:26.812 --> 01:43:29.554]  Or just type in Big Daddy Don Garlitz, Ron Paul, into Google.
[01:43:29.574 --> 01:43:31.615]  You can read his writings about it.
[01:43:31.915 --> 01:43:34.156]  Of these 25 points, there's a lot of them I haven't mentioned.
[01:43:34.416 --> 01:43:36.817]  What are some of the other key points why we should support Ron Paul?
[01:43:37.389 --> 01:43:42.212]  Well, I like the part that he's never voted for an unbalanced budget.
[01:43:42.312 --> 01:43:44.694]  He's never taken a government-paid junket.
[01:43:45.014 --> 01:43:47.075]  He's never voted for a tax increase.
[01:43:47.676 --> 01:43:50.878]  He's never voted for a congressional pay raise.
[01:43:50.898 --> 01:43:51.538]  I love that.
[01:43:52.339 --> 01:43:58.223]  And he doesn't use and is not going to use the congressional retirement plan.
[01:43:59.144 --> 01:44:02.186]  And, you know, it's just on and on.
[01:44:03.106 --> 01:44:07.269]  He's been repeatedly named the taxpayer's best friend in Congress.
[01:44:07.791 --> 01:44:09.172]  And that's good.
[01:44:09.792 --> 01:44:15.536]  And, you know, not a member of the Council of Foreign Relations or the Trilateral Commission, that's a big plus for him, too.
[01:44:16.117 --> 01:44:27.125]  And he's never taken a paid junket, and they try to spin it and say, well, he asked for a bunch of earmarks, and as he pointed out, the government's already stolen the money, he's just trying to give it back to his district.
[01:44:27.685 --> 01:44:29.086]  Right, that's exactly right.
[01:44:31.247 --> 01:44:32.088]  It's unbelievable.
[01:44:32.568 --> 01:44:38.031]  Now, this North American Union, they've been trying to stonewall that, but now it's becoming a household word.
[01:44:38.351 --> 01:44:42.253]  What is Big Daddy Don Garlitz's idea on how we can continue to spread the word about this?
[01:44:43.174 --> 01:44:53.200]  Well, we have got to get the word out because, you know, when Ron Paul first mentioned it on one of the debates, they made out like he was some kind of a nutcase, that there was no such thing going on.
[01:44:53.540 --> 01:45:00.344]  There's all the plans for the big highway right up through the United States all the way to Canada, and they've been taking the land away.
[01:45:00.697 --> 01:45:02.818]  Through eminent domain to build this highway.
[01:45:03.118 --> 01:45:04.219]  It's the real deal.
[01:45:04.799 --> 01:45:05.960]  They want to form this.
[01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:13.905]  And, you know, I've actually seen some of the coins that they ran some sample coins off of the AmeriCo, they call it.
[01:45:14.372 --> 01:45:18.753]  You know, for the new money, just like the Euro over in Europe.
[01:45:18.793 --> 01:45:21.213]  We have the official NAU documents.
[01:45:21.233 --> 01:45:22.193]  They call it a union.
[01:45:22.233 --> 01:45:23.134]  They call it a merger.
[01:45:23.174 --> 01:45:24.294]  They call it a community.
[01:45:24.594 --> 01:45:25.974]  That's how they started the European Union.
[01:45:26.014 --> 01:45:35.796]  We have their own SPP documents from now, 2006 in September, where they said, first agenda, that a secret meeting in Canada with the three governments is to keep it secret from us.
[01:45:36.216 --> 01:45:37.276]  Is that hot treason, sir?
[01:45:38.356 --> 01:45:39.697]  Oh, it is treason.
[01:45:39.757 --> 01:45:41.557]  Bush and the Mexican...
[01:45:42.903 --> 01:45:50.395]  And the Canadian president had a meeting in Canada not too long ago, and the press couldn't even attend.
[01:45:52.538 --> 01:45:52.758]  I know.
[01:45:52.798 --> 01:45:57.060]  They've had three of those up in Canada, and of course they kicked off the NAU back in 2005.
[01:45:57.400 --> 01:46:02.962]  In the BAMF Canada, it says we're going to get a carbon tax, we're going to use these roads to tax people, we're going to merge the military.
[01:46:03.402 --> 01:46:04.283]  It's all right there.
[01:46:04.323 --> 01:46:16.468]  I made a film, Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement, breaking that down, Big Daddy, and I'm going to have to, before you leave us during the break, I'm here in the next segment with us, get your address so I can send you a couple copies of Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:46:16.828 --> 01:46:18.488]  Also, what about socialized health care?
[01:46:18.528 --> 01:46:19.389]  What people don't get is...
[01:46:20.229 --> 01:46:22.470]  We had the best healthcare in the world when it was free market.
[01:46:22.850 --> 01:46:27.112]  Now they've brought in all this control and HMOs and driven up the prices.
[01:46:27.132 --> 01:46:28.013]  Can you imagine?
[01:46:28.253 --> 01:46:34.436]  Hillary and Edwards say they're going to make us go to the doctor, and then the state's going to basically make us take the drugs they want.
[01:46:34.676 --> 01:46:36.037]  That sounds like hell on earth.
[01:46:36.057 --> 01:46:37.037]  It is.
[01:46:37.257 --> 01:46:38.318]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[01:46:38.338 --> 01:46:41.579]  We do not want healthcare, national healthcare.
[01:46:41.599 --> 01:46:47.002]  If you think national healthcare is good, go up to Canada and see how long you have to wait to get an operation.
[01:46:47.546 --> 01:46:49.247]  Now, we've got the best health care in the world.
[01:46:49.267 --> 01:46:59.690]  The only problem with our health care system right today is so much money is being spent on the illegals to keep them up that somebody has to pay.
[01:46:59.770 --> 01:47:06.892]  So they've raised the price to the insurance companies and to the people who have to pay, and that's why our health care is so expensive.
[01:47:07.032 --> 01:47:14.595]  If you took the illegals out of the equation, the health care could come back down to an affordable amount, and that's what needs to be done.
[01:47:15.825 --> 01:47:19.948]  Of course, if a person doesn't want insurance, then that's fine.
[01:47:20.268 --> 01:47:25.492]  But then they shouldn't be able to go to the emergency room if they've got a job at all and just get free health care.
[01:47:26.393 --> 01:47:28.855]  So there's a few things that do have to be straightened out.
[01:47:30.175 --> 01:47:42.424]  You know, one of the biggest things Ron Paul has done is he's not participated in the lucrative, I mean, being in Congress off and on 20 years, he would be getting $4 or $5 million, and he just said, no, I'm not going to participate in the pension program.
[01:47:42.965 --> 01:47:43.185]  Right.
[01:47:43.743 --> 01:47:44.243]  That's good.
[01:47:44.664 --> 01:47:46.085]  Now, we've got a final segment coming up.
[01:47:46.105 --> 01:47:51.148]  I want to talk about strategies, ideas, where you think the campaign's going, spurring the young people to take action.
[01:47:51.188 --> 01:47:54.310]  But Big Daddy, I've got to ask you a few questions about drag racing while you're here.
[01:47:54.810 --> 01:47:56.551]  A, what was the fastest you've ever gone?
[01:47:56.872 --> 01:48:03.296]  And B, what was the focus like right before the green flag came down?
[01:48:04.416 --> 01:48:08.279]  Well, my fastest speed was in March of 2003.
[01:48:08.659 --> 01:48:09.920]  I drove my fuel dragster.
[01:48:11.130 --> 01:48:23.482]  323.04 miles an hour in 4.7 seconds, and I'll tell you, it's a rush because you get hit with eight Gs, and it pulls you back in the seat and takes your breath away.
[01:48:23.662 --> 01:48:25.764]  Were you 69 or 70 when you did that?
[01:48:27.425 --> 01:48:27.926]  I was what?
[01:48:28.787 --> 01:48:30.068]  How old were you when you did that?
[01:48:31.049 --> 01:48:31.569]  In 2003, I was 71.
[01:48:31.610 --> 01:48:31.970]  Unbelievable!
[01:48:36.587 --> 01:48:37.467]  Eight Gs.
[01:48:37.608 --> 01:48:39.028]  I mean, how do you do that?
[01:48:39.108 --> 01:48:40.328]  Fighter pilots would have trouble.
[01:48:40.348 --> 01:48:44.730]  Do you wear the same type output that keeps the blood in the chest when you do that?
[01:48:45.610 --> 01:48:50.312]  I did have an air seat, which was similar, but not exactly the same.
[01:48:50.432 --> 01:48:56.254]  The problem with us and the cars, the way our cars do, the blood all rushes to the head.
[01:48:56.636 --> 01:49:03.600]  We're in the fighter pilots, they have to shut off the blood going down in the feet because it goes down and leaves the brain.
[01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:06.081]  So we didn't have a problem with blackout.
[01:49:06.581 --> 01:49:17.287]  It's just that it was hard on your internal organs because everything is eight times its normal weight, and that makes the liver real heavy, and it slams around inside that rib cage, and it's not good for it.
[01:49:17.307 --> 01:49:19.008]  I bet.
[01:49:19.108 --> 01:49:21.229]  So you feel like you've been beat up after going that fast?
[01:49:22.110 --> 01:49:24.291]  Well, you feel like you're beat up when you get out of it.
[01:49:26.079 --> 01:49:26.499]  Amazing.
[01:49:26.519 --> 01:49:30.661]  I can't imagine being at zero and in seven seconds on the ground going 300 what?
[01:49:30.681 --> 01:49:32.582]  How fast?
[01:49:32.602 --> 01:49:33.802]  323 miles an hour, 4.7 seconds.
[01:49:33.822 --> 01:49:37.964]  But that's not... Here's the tough part of it.
[01:49:38.024 --> 01:49:38.524]  Well, stay there.
[01:49:38.544 --> 01:49:41.245]  We're going to be back... Big Daddy, we've got to break.
[01:49:41.685 --> 01:49:42.606]  The satellite's kicking in.
[01:49:42.886 --> 01:49:43.946]  We'll be back in three minutes, sir.
[01:49:43.986 --> 01:49:45.427]  I want to hear about the tough part when we get back.
[01:49:45.627 --> 01:49:46.827]  A little bit more on Ron Paul.
[01:49:47.148 --> 01:49:48.448]  Big Daddy, Don Garlitz.
[01:49:48.748 --> 01:49:51.109]  The 25 reasons you should vote for Ron Paul.
[01:49:54.050 --> 01:49:55.351]  It is a big idea.
[01:49:56.500 --> 01:49:57.541]  A new world order.
[01:49:58.261 --> 01:50:02.304]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:50:02.324 --> 01:50:04.945]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[01:50:05.986 --> 01:50:08.267]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:50:08.768 --> 01:50:11.229]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:50:11.949 --> 01:50:19.294]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:50:22.307 --> 01:50:27.270]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:50:27.751 --> 01:50:31.233]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:50:31.613 --> 01:50:34.115]  Bill Vargas is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:50:34.175 --> 01:50:35.136]  Most people have no idea.
[01:50:35.156 --> 01:50:36.116]  They're not after money.
[01:50:36.136 --> 01:50:37.217]  They have all the money they need.
[01:50:37.417 --> 01:50:38.198]  They're after power.
[01:50:38.398 --> 01:50:39.418]  That's what they're after.
[01:50:39.539 --> 01:50:47.744]  Order Endgame on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:50:47.844 --> 01:50:51.006]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:50:51.066 --> 01:50:52.107]  You have been warned.
[01:50:53.187 --> 01:50:57.448]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:50:57.708 --> 01:51:02.589]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:51:02.789 --> 01:51:04.129]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:51:04.309 --> 01:51:07.790]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[01:52:10.925 --> 01:52:17.627]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:52:17.947 --> 01:52:19.568]  There are no reported side effects.

[01:52:54.888 --> 01:53:00.052]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:53:00.713 --> 01:53:03.195]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:53:04.435 --> 01:53:07.758]  Hence the new website, ronpaulwarroom.com.
[01:53:07.818 --> 01:53:09.179]  ronpaulwarroom.com.
[01:53:09.199 --> 01:53:12.021]  Go sign up, post, post your own blogs, whatever.
[01:53:12.041 --> 01:53:15.524]  Big Daddy Don Garlitz, the king of drag racing.
[01:53:15.544 --> 01:53:17.666]  The Undisputed King is our guest for the next four minutes.
[01:53:18.126 --> 01:53:19.387]  And then he is gone.
[01:53:20.007 --> 01:53:20.808]  We're very honored to have him.
[01:53:20.828 --> 01:53:23.150]  You were talking about the hardest part of drag racing, sir.
[01:53:24.525 --> 01:53:27.448]  Well, it's different today than it used to be.
[01:53:27.468 --> 01:53:31.872]  Today, it's getting up the money to do it.
[01:53:31.912 --> 01:53:36.216]  It costs $10,000 to make one run, so you've got to have a lot of money to make these runs.
[01:53:36.596 --> 01:53:49.428]  Back when I started, the hardest part of drag racing was working all night long, working on your car, because you had a job to earn your living with during the day, so the only time you worked on a drag car was at night, so you didn't get much sleep.
[01:53:52.635 --> 01:53:53.255]  Absolutely.
[01:53:53.295 --> 01:53:55.376]  The golden days of racing.
[01:53:57.177 --> 01:53:58.918]  How did you face the danger every time?
[01:53:58.938 --> 01:54:00.299]  But I guess you didn't have time for fear.
[01:54:00.319 --> 01:54:01.019]  You just focused.
[01:54:01.720 --> 01:54:02.460]  Well, I was young.
[01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:03.240]  I didn't think about it.
[01:54:03.260 --> 01:54:04.261]  I built my own cars.
[01:54:04.341 --> 01:54:05.261]  I felt they were safe.
[01:54:05.321 --> 01:54:07.382]  But, of course, I had a few accidents.
[01:54:07.482 --> 01:54:08.563]  No question about it.
[01:54:10.791 --> 01:54:27.761]  Finishing up with Ron Paul, I just keep marveling at the strength of this revolution, because just like a drag racer, or just like a space shuttle, when it's taking off, it takes off and uses most of its fuel right there at the start, and then most of the acceleration is at the end.
[01:54:27.981 --> 01:54:31.043]  We're now seeing exponential acceleration of the campaign.
[01:54:31.063 --> 01:54:31.723]  Can you talk about that?
[01:54:33.888 --> 01:54:38.371]  I think that it's going to be unbelievable the further we get into this thing.
[01:54:38.391 --> 01:54:40.132]  When we start actually voting.
[01:54:40.152 --> 01:54:42.693]  See, the caucus thing in Iowa, that's a little different.
[01:54:43.314 --> 01:54:44.975]  It's a strange way that works.
[01:54:45.075 --> 01:54:49.818]  I'm interested to see when the people actually go into the voting booths and vote.
[01:54:52.119 --> 01:54:54.481]  We're going to find out in just a few days, aren't we?
[01:54:55.181 --> 01:54:55.842]  Yes, we are.
[01:54:56.142 --> 01:54:56.822]  I can't wait.
[01:54:58.163 --> 01:55:00.605]  I was impressed with the finish in Iowa.
[01:55:02.097 --> 01:55:04.798]  Look how far ahead of Rudy he finished.
[01:55:05.418 --> 01:55:06.078]  Giuliani?
[01:55:06.599 --> 01:55:07.039]  Yeah.
[01:55:09.020 --> 01:55:11.600]  Well, I don't know how... He got three times the votes he got.
[01:55:12.081 --> 01:55:16.522]  Well, I don't know how Democrats who are anti-war can vote for anybody but Ron Paul.
[01:55:16.862 --> 01:55:18.323]  I mean, how could they vote for Hillary?
[01:55:18.363 --> 01:55:21.084]  They need to come over fast and support Ron Paul.
[01:55:21.724 --> 01:55:21.964]  Yes.
[01:55:22.264 --> 01:55:22.864]  Yes, they do.
[01:55:23.605 --> 01:55:27.246]  And in closing, Big Daddy Don Gar, let's give us your take on these endless wars.
[01:55:32.150 --> 01:55:32.911]  Big Daddy, are you there?
[01:55:34.292 --> 01:55:35.013]  I didn't hear that.
[01:55:35.173 --> 01:55:37.015]  Yeah, I think your cell phone cut out.
[01:55:37.956 --> 01:55:40.038]  Give us your take on these endless wars, sir.
[01:55:40.979 --> 01:55:45.143]  Oh, I mean, it's like that George Orwell's 1984 book.
[01:55:45.283 --> 01:55:46.845]  It was perpetual war.
[01:55:46.865 --> 01:55:52.951]  I mean, we've got troops in 60 countries, for God's sake, and we can't even seal the southern border.
[01:55:53.111 --> 01:55:53.771]  Are we crazy?
[01:55:55.947 --> 01:55:57.968]  Well, we have masses of troops in 60-plus.
[01:55:57.988 --> 01:55:59.128]  They're actually in over 100.
[01:55:59.168 --> 01:56:01.789]  I mean, I heard 60.
[01:56:02.109 --> 01:56:02.889]  That's enough.
[01:56:03.229 --> 01:56:04.170]  That's more than enough.
[01:56:04.470 --> 01:56:10.451]  I mean, if our southern... I wouldn't have a troop overseas until that southern border was sealed.
[01:56:11.352 --> 01:56:15.853]  If I had to have the troops there holding hands with each other and an M-16.
[01:56:15.993 --> 01:56:20.314]  I mean, here's what's so ridiculous about that southern border.
[01:56:20.594 --> 01:56:23.475]  85% of the American people with the southern border sealed.
[01:56:24.016 --> 01:56:32.160]  There is Area 51 out there in Nevada where they do the UFO stuff and all, you know, and all the special flying things.
[01:56:32.961 --> 01:56:34.782]  And they don't even have a fence around it.
[01:56:35.202 --> 01:56:38.844]  They just got these signs every so often that says, Don't cross this point.
[01:56:39.224 --> 01:56:41.045]  Deadly force will be used.
[01:56:41.425 --> 01:56:42.826]  And they have shot a few.
[01:56:43.550 --> 01:56:45.173]  Not very many, just a few.
[01:56:45.413 --> 01:56:47.556]  But nobody goes into Area 51.
[01:56:47.836 --> 01:56:53.725]  You can't tell me they couldn't place a few signs along the southern border in Spanish, naturally.
[01:56:54.266 --> 01:56:55.728]  Do not cross this area.
[01:56:55.748 --> 01:56:58.693]  Deadly force will be used and just a few snipers will...
[01:56:59.433 --> 01:57:00.614]  50 caliber rifle.
[01:57:00.634 --> 01:57:02.916]  You wouldn't have to shoot many.
[01:57:03.216 --> 01:57:06.418]  You can only use deadly force on American citizens, though.
[01:57:06.938 --> 01:57:07.519]  I know.
[01:57:07.699 --> 01:57:12.382]  The police admit they're not even allowed to arrest illegal aliens now for no driver's license.
[01:57:13.122 --> 01:57:20.907]  Everything is upside down, and this is exactly why Ron Paul is doing so good, because he's got common sense.
[01:57:21.828 --> 01:57:23.009]  That's a good place to leave it.
[01:57:23.129 --> 01:57:25.671]  Garlitz.com, Big Daddy, Don Garlitz.
[01:57:25.751 --> 01:57:27.692]  It's been a real honor to have you here with us, sir.
[01:57:28.402 --> 01:57:28.902]  Thank you.
[01:57:29.442 --> 01:57:30.763]  God bless and Godspeed.
[01:57:30.803 --> 01:57:32.584]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:35.125 --> 01:57:37.046]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:57:38.626 --> 01:57:44.269]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:57:50.111 --> 01:57:50.771]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.411 --> 01:57:52.512]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.192 --> 01:57:54.313]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.933 --> 01:57:55.773]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.514 --> 01:57:57.314]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.072 --> 01:58:01.856]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.257 --> 01:58:06.381]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.462 --> 01:58:07.882]  All right.
[01:58:08.343 --> 01:58:12.748]  We started the show with Kent Schneider, the head of the Ron Paul 2008 campaign.
[01:58:12.768 --> 01:58:17.533]  Then we had, of course, Dr. Rand Paul, son of Ron Paul, on.
[01:58:18.794 --> 01:58:19.495]  Your calls.
[01:58:20.316 --> 01:58:20.496]  Then...
[01:58:21.497 --> 01:58:26.480]  Big Daddy, the king of drag racing, big supporter and friends with Ron Paul, just came on.
[01:58:26.500 --> 01:58:28.081]  That was great.
[01:58:28.782 --> 01:58:30.803]  And the campaign's probably called us eight, nine times.
[01:58:30.843 --> 01:58:32.544]  They keep backing up when he's going to be on.
[01:58:32.724 --> 01:58:34.205]  They don't do that unless he's coming on.
[01:58:35.806 --> 01:58:37.427]  But you get behind, things happen.
[01:58:38.608 --> 01:58:39.228]  We got an hour.
[01:58:39.448 --> 01:58:43.251]  We got 59 minutes, but I guess really about 30 or 40, so we have some time.
[01:58:43.271 --> 01:58:45.232]  We got 30 or 40 minutes to get Ron Paul on.
[01:58:46.173 --> 01:58:47.934]  And, you know...
[01:58:48.550 --> 01:58:55.177]  We're going to see what happens today, but regardless, you've heard his son, you've heard the campaign manager, you've heard Big Daddy Don Garlitz, and a lot more.
[01:58:55.197 --> 01:58:56.558]  We're going to take some calls in the sound.
[01:58:56.578 --> 01:58:59.461]  I've got a bunch of other news that isn't Ron Paul related I've got to get to.
[01:58:59.922 --> 01:59:02.464]  Really serious torture news, really serious Big Brother news.
[01:59:02.745 --> 01:59:04.747]  They're putting face-scanning cameras in schools now.
[01:59:06.408 --> 01:59:09.451]  Just incredible Big Brother stuff coming out of the closet now.
[01:59:09.491 --> 01:59:11.834]  They built the grid, now they're telling the slaves about it.
[01:59:12.839 --> 01:59:17.000]  And we've got the toll-free number for you to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:59:17.741 --> 01:59:21.022]  Nemo's got a great article at TruthNews.us that I want to get out to everybody.
[01:59:21.962 --> 01:59:25.943]  It's a great article, but no room on the debate bus for Ron Paul.
[01:59:27.143 --> 01:59:39.047]  You might want to add to that headline just the fact that Ron Paul comes in fifth place, but won't be among five who are in debate.
[01:59:39.747 --> 01:59:41.828]  See, they said, oh, we're only having the top five, top tier.
[01:59:42.574 --> 01:59:43.934]  We're not having the second lower half.
[01:59:44.214 --> 01:59:47.815]  Well, he got in, even in the Iowa-rigged caucus, which is totally rigged.
[01:59:48.176 --> 01:59:49.856]  The campaign's being nice in not calling it that.
[01:59:50.416 --> 01:59:51.196]  Totally skewed.
[01:59:51.236 --> 01:59:51.937]  Good old boy's thing.
[01:59:51.957 --> 01:59:52.277]  Go read it.
[01:59:52.297 --> 01:59:53.637]  It's not even really voting.
[01:59:53.697 --> 01:59:59.139]  It's like... But anyways... There it is.
[01:59:59.179 --> 02:00:00.119]  It's a real simple equation.
[02:00:00.928 --> 02:00:02.829]  There are five people on.
[02:00:03.129 --> 02:00:04.609]  Supposedly the top five candidates.
[02:00:04.669 --> 02:00:05.749]  He's in the top five.
[02:00:06.010 --> 02:00:10.031]  They said Iowa was... ABC said, we're going to choose who's in our debate according to Iowa.
[02:00:10.311 --> 02:00:11.071]  Only the top five.
[02:00:11.511 --> 02:00:12.451]  People got all upset.
[02:00:12.531 --> 02:00:14.092]  Hey, ABC said today.
[02:00:15.032 --> 02:00:16.413]  Actually said last night at about midnight.
[02:00:16.433 --> 02:00:18.313]  They said, okay, Ron Paul's in.
[02:00:18.333 --> 02:00:19.233]  He got in the top five.
[02:00:19.874 --> 02:00:20.654]  Fair enough.
[02:00:21.074 --> 02:00:22.234]  Fair enough, ABC.
[02:00:22.294 --> 02:00:22.694]  Good.
[02:00:23.835 --> 02:00:24.815]  Not Fox News.
[02:00:25.195 --> 02:00:26.916]  They are still saying he's not going to be there.
[02:00:27.196 --> 02:00:28.176]  This story is important.
[02:00:29.142 --> 02:00:29.843]  It breaks it down.
[02:00:29.903 --> 02:00:30.683]  He is number five.
[02:00:30.964 --> 02:00:33.406]  That's kind of like you got five places in a drag race.
[02:00:33.486 --> 02:00:35.287]  Or actually in a stock car race.
[02:00:36.288 --> 02:00:38.370]  And the top five places is actually what they count.
[02:00:38.790 --> 02:00:43.434]  Ron Paul gets fifth and they say, sorry, Giuliani was way behind you.
[02:00:44.055 --> 02:00:46.277]  Way behind you and got less than half the votes you got.
[02:00:46.777 --> 02:00:50.400]  He was a couple of dozen cars behind you.
[02:00:50.441 --> 02:00:53.563]  But we're going to go ahead and give him fifth place.
[02:00:54.584 --> 02:00:55.365]  How's that sound?
[02:00:55.385 --> 02:00:56.526]  I mean, that's Fox News.
[02:00:57.529 --> 02:00:59.270]  Fair and balanced government propaganda.
[02:00:59.290 --> 02:01:04.392]  A little liberal, fake conservative, a little... It's just absolutely disgusting.
[02:01:05.892 --> 02:01:09.754]  But we need to just add into this headline, Nemo, if you're listening, because we all just brainstorm together.
[02:01:09.774 --> 02:01:11.175]  This isn't me saying I'm high and mighty.
[02:01:11.575 --> 02:01:12.715]  My writer's no more than I do.
[02:01:12.755 --> 02:01:13.576]  We just all integrate.
[02:01:13.616 --> 02:01:15.096]  She was hearing war rooming on air.
[02:01:16.437 --> 02:01:18.098]  No room on the debate bus for Ron Paul.
[02:01:19.378 --> 02:01:26.281]  And then just Fox News to have top five candidates...
[02:01:27.390 --> 02:01:31.651]  Or Fox News to have five... Something simple like... So people get it.
[02:01:31.672 --> 02:01:33.092]  Because the headline is key for it to spread.
[02:01:33.112 --> 02:01:34.332]  Which is so important.
[02:01:34.352 --> 02:01:38.294]  I don't know if the headline even transmits how serious this is.
[02:01:40.334 --> 02:01:43.656]  Fox News said that they would only take the top five places.
[02:01:44.776 --> 02:01:49.457]  But excluded Ron Paul from the beginning and said they're only having the top five.
[02:01:50.458 --> 02:01:53.679]  Now Ron Paul comes in fifth place and they say we're still excluding you.
[02:01:53.699 --> 02:01:55.199]  I mean, it's real simple.
[02:01:55.860 --> 02:01:56.680]  Ron Paul said they were...
[02:01:58.951 --> 02:02:00.252]  That they'd be happy with 10, 12%.
[02:02:00.912 --> 02:02:02.534]  That's what they got, and it's a big victory.
[02:02:03.174 --> 02:02:05.255]  And Fox News needs to back off.
[02:02:05.275 --> 02:02:06.516]  By the way, their stock's plunging.
[02:02:06.536 --> 02:02:07.677]  I've got news reports on that.
[02:02:07.977 --> 02:02:09.699]  People are boycotting News Corp stock.
[02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:13.681]  I don't know if that really does much, actually.
[02:02:13.701 --> 02:02:14.962]  It just allows them to buy it up cheaper.
[02:02:14.982 --> 02:02:15.903]  That's what they do.
[02:02:16.503 --> 02:02:18.184]  At least it's a good symbol to other people.
[02:02:18.745 --> 02:02:20.266]  But the boycott is having an effect.
[02:02:21.107 --> 02:02:24.129]  And all the news on that is at ronpaulwarroom.com.
[02:02:25.590 --> 02:02:27.371]  All right, the head of the campaign's had his say.
[02:02:29.534 --> 02:02:30.897]  Ken Schneider, Ron Paul's son.
[02:02:30.937 --> 02:02:31.999]  Dr. Paul's had his say.
[02:02:32.480 --> 02:02:34.083]  Big Daddy Don Garlis has had his say.
[02:02:34.103 --> 02:02:37.930]  A lot of you have had your say, but more of you will have your say after this quick break.
[02:02:37.970 --> 02:02:40.194]  And Ron Paul is in the cars.
[02:02:40.234 --> 02:02:41.296]  They say he's calling in.
[02:02:41.316 --> 02:02:42.178]  We'll see if that happens.
[02:02:45.858 --> 02:02:53.785]  For years, you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained the leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[02:02:54.246 --> 02:02:57.409]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?

[02:03:45.955 --> 02:03:47.356]  It is a big idea.
[02:03:47.376 --> 02:03:49.478]  A new world order.
[02:03:50.198 --> 02:03:55.422]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful government.
[02:03:55.442 --> 02:03:57.183]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:03:57.893 --> 02:04:00.155]  Wouldn't their objective be world domination?
[02:04:00.675 --> 02:04:03.137]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:04:03.857 --> 02:04:11.183]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:04:14.255 --> 02:04:16.917]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:04:16.997 --> 02:04:19.198]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:04:19.258 --> 02:04:20.379]  You have been warned.
[02:04:44.856 --> 02:04:48.221]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, We are living in this time of Earth's history.
[02:05:00.979 --> 02:05:01.520]  We're good to go.
[02:05:17.433 --> 02:05:21.756]  The Bible says we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, the Unholy Alliance.
[02:05:22.056 --> 02:05:26.319]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.

[02:05:36.706 --> 02:05:37.667]  And ask for Packet B.
[02:05:50.217 --> 02:05:50.877]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.538 --> 02:05:52.638]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.298 --> 02:05:54.419]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:55.059 --> 02:05:55.879]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.640 --> 02:05:57.520]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.540 --> 02:06:02.142]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.382 --> 02:06:06.524]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:10.825 --> 02:06:14.507]  Third and final hour, Big Daddy Don Garland's Drag Race King popped in.
[02:06:15.678 --> 02:06:19.800]  Head of the Ron Paul 2008 campaign and Dr. Rand Paul has also been on the show.
[02:06:19.900 --> 02:06:24.602]  Congressman Ron Paul is vectoring in to pop in any minute in the next 40 minutes.
[02:06:25.142 --> 02:06:29.003]  I am told by the campaign again, it's just, everything gets behind in these campaigns.
[02:06:29.043 --> 02:06:30.604]  People used to always say Bill Clinton was bad.
[02:06:30.864 --> 02:06:32.305]  Well, he was bad for a thousand reasons.
[02:06:32.705 --> 02:06:35.106]  But it wasn't because he's always an hour late or two hours late.
[02:06:35.626 --> 02:06:39.187]  It's because on these campaigns, man, they just stack too much in and then it just gets behind.
[02:06:39.608 --> 02:06:40.988]  But Ron Paul is always faithful.
[02:06:41.028 --> 02:06:42.869]  If he hadn't on today, he'll be on Sunday or Monday.
[02:06:43.556 --> 02:06:45.537]  Believe me, they're really nice.
[02:06:45.557 --> 02:06:46.557]  They're too nice to us here.
[02:06:46.577 --> 02:06:50.538]  The head of the campaign calls us up and stuff during breaks.
[02:06:51.498 --> 02:06:52.659]  Because they know you.
[02:06:52.819 --> 02:06:54.259]  They respect you, the listeners.
[02:06:54.299 --> 02:06:56.580]  And they appreciate you because they know you're there.
[02:06:56.660 --> 02:06:57.320]  You're the seed.
[02:06:57.360 --> 02:06:59.400]  You are the launching pad for Ron Paul.
[02:07:00.921 --> 02:07:04.942]  If you can say there was a zeitgeist that Ron Paul first tied into that launched him...
[02:07:05.865 --> 02:07:13.348]  It's obviously his ideas, his humbleness, his record, but the zeitgeist of the public was you, the listeners of this radio show.
[02:07:13.988 --> 02:07:15.869]  And Ron Paul, I would never say that.
[02:07:16.129 --> 02:07:17.070]  He told me that privately.
[02:07:17.430 --> 02:07:18.450]  But I had never said that.
[02:07:18.490 --> 02:07:19.211]  He just came on air.
[02:07:19.231 --> 02:07:20.131]  Remember that and said that.
[02:07:20.491 --> 02:07:22.292]  That's the power you've got.
[02:07:22.890 --> 02:07:23.491]  We're good to go.
[02:07:42.006 --> 02:07:42.686]  Get the films.
[02:07:42.746 --> 02:07:43.207]  Get them out.
[02:07:43.247 --> 02:07:43.987]  It's an info war.
[02:07:44.247 --> 02:07:53.172]  You can talk yourself blue in the face trying to wake your mama, your daddy, your granny, your neighbor, your boss, but a highly produced film, well documented, with an online bibliography.
[02:07:53.212 --> 02:07:54.892]  We got that for Martial Law and Endgame.
[02:07:55.893 --> 02:07:56.413]  You got them.
[02:07:56.613 --> 02:07:57.394]  You got the facts.
[02:07:57.914 --> 02:07:59.195]  We got to expose the NAU.
[02:07:59.215 --> 02:08:00.175]  Get Endgame today.
[02:08:00.795 --> 02:08:01.236]  All right.
[02:08:03.757 --> 02:08:04.817]  Let's go to Joe in Brooklyn.
[02:08:04.837 --> 02:08:05.338]  Joe, go ahead.
[02:08:05.358 --> 02:08:05.838]  You're on the air.
[02:08:07.034 --> 02:08:07.354]  Hey, Alex.
[02:08:07.714 --> 02:08:08.575]  Hey, Joe, hit me.
[02:08:08.935 --> 02:08:09.275]  Hit me.
[02:08:09.475 --> 02:08:20.340]  Hey, I just wanted to ask a couple questions about the CFR, and I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the CFR and its seemingly overwhelming influence over this election.
[02:08:21.340 --> 02:08:28.663]  I want to know if there's any resources or anything I can say to the supporters of other candidates to sort of wake them up
[02:08:29.286 --> 02:08:32.547]  On what the CFR is and how all these candidates being on the CFR.
[02:08:32.567 --> 02:08:38.308]  Well, I know Huckabee was at 1% until he spoke to the CFR and literally prostrated himself before them.
[02:08:38.989 --> 02:08:41.009]  And you saw him take off like a rocket.
[02:08:41.889 --> 02:08:47.531]  Every president has been a member of the CFR going back for, since Kennedy, he wasn't.
[02:08:48.326 --> 02:08:49.827]  And a lot of them before that.
[02:08:49.847 --> 02:08:54.249]  It was publicly set up by British intelligence to take over the United States in 1922.
[02:08:54.409 --> 02:09:00.673]  It's swollen from 500 members to 4,300 members right now.
[02:09:00.693 --> 02:09:05.115]  99% of every banking chairman of every major banking corps, every major university head.
[02:09:05.715 --> 02:09:05.815]  It's...
[02:09:33.709 --> 02:09:36.071]  Is there any resources that I might be able to point out to people?
[02:09:36.091 --> 02:09:38.473]  Because a lot of people don't even know what the CFR is.
[02:09:38.593 --> 02:09:42.156]  Is there anything that I can sort of point people to that will expose the CFR?
[02:09:42.356 --> 02:09:51.424]  Yeah, just type CFR New World Order quotes into Google, and you'll find thousands of them calling for world government, bibliographed where you can actually find it.
[02:09:52.485 --> 02:10:00.892]  Then your friends will say it doesn't exist, so maybe you can like... I mean, CFR members have written hundreds of books where they call for killing us, getting rid of us, world government...
[02:10:02.012 --> 02:10:02.892]  World taxes.
[02:10:02.973 --> 02:10:16.999]  You could buy the 1,400-page Carol Quigley head of Georgetown political science arm, where he admits that he's for the world government and one of their tacticians, and where he breaks down how they finance Hitler and everything else and how they run everything.
[02:10:17.619 --> 02:10:21.501]  That's Tragedy and Hope, or Between Two Ages is another good one by Brzezinski.
[02:10:22.632 --> 02:10:24.113]  It was all out there then.
[02:10:24.133 --> 02:10:29.196]  But yeah, but they know people might read junk pulp fiction.
[02:10:29.236 --> 02:10:30.737]  They might read love novels.
[02:10:31.097 --> 02:10:35.580]  I mean, maybe four, five, six, depending on the poll, actually read more than two books a year.
[02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:39.863]  But of that 4%, the vast majority read murder-she-wrote crap.
[02:10:40.583 --> 02:10:42.745]  And so they're not reading political textbooks.
[02:10:44.165 --> 02:10:46.507]  But it's all there.
[02:10:48.075 --> 02:10:48.976]  Okay, well, thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:10:49.036 --> 02:10:58.040]  I just also wanted to say, here in Brooklyn, we have like 5 million strong here, and I just wanted to remind everybody that we have until this Friday to register to vote.
[02:10:58.060 --> 02:11:01.382]  If you've never registered in New York, you can register as a Republican and vote.
[02:11:01.462 --> 02:11:03.363]  So I just wanted to get everybody out there to do that.
[02:11:03.383 --> 02:11:03.583]  Thank you.
[02:11:03.603 --> 02:11:04.684]  Good to hear from you, sir.
[02:11:06.205 --> 02:11:14.129]  By the way, a lot of you are so trained, even though you think you're info warriors, and a lot of you are online and things doing fabulous jobs.
[02:11:14.969 --> 02:11:18.612]  You're conditioned to think of everybody else going out and taking action physically.
[02:11:20.473 --> 02:11:24.856]  I mean, a lot of you will be shocked to consciously think right now and go, wait a minute, I haven't registered.
[02:11:24.916 --> 02:11:25.677]  I haven't gone down.
[02:11:25.697 --> 02:11:26.838]  I don't even know where to vote.
[02:11:26.938 --> 02:11:28.319]  I don't even know how this works.
[02:11:28.339 --> 02:11:29.460]  I don't even know the date of my stay.
[02:11:29.500 --> 02:11:36.024]  I don't even... I bet about half my listeners, even though you're more tuned in than 99% of people, I bet you're going, whoa, I'm not even registered to vote.
[02:11:36.725 --> 02:11:39.927]  Whoa, I'm not even... I don't even know where my primary is at.
[02:11:39.947 --> 02:11:40.508]  I don't even know...
[02:11:41.204 --> 02:11:41.945]  What's going on?
[02:11:42.005 --> 02:11:43.506]  I haven't joined a poll-watching group.
[02:11:43.586 --> 02:11:45.828]  I'm not even canvassing for Ron Paul.
[02:11:45.868 --> 02:11:47.189]  I haven't put a Ron Paul sign up.
[02:11:47.269 --> 02:11:49.030]  I haven't burned a copy of Endgame.
[02:11:50.611 --> 02:11:51.592]  Or Freedom to Fascism.
[02:11:51.632 --> 02:11:52.012]  You better.
[02:11:53.714 --> 02:11:55.955]  And again, it isn't about, oh, it's rigged, or it's this or that.
[02:11:55.995 --> 02:11:56.936]  It's about taking action.
[02:11:57.537 --> 02:12:01.019]  Just the process of stepping forward is where it all starts.
[02:12:01.920 --> 02:12:05.523]  Let's go ahead and talk to Nick in Arizona land.
[02:12:05.583 --> 02:12:06.003]  Go ahead.
[02:12:08.125 --> 02:12:08.405]  Hello?
[02:12:08.585 --> 02:12:09.786]  You're on the air, squad leader.
[02:12:10.618 --> 02:12:11.679]  Hey, how you doing?
[02:12:11.959 --> 02:12:19.482]  Lately, the last few days in the Phoenix Valley, I've been seeing chemtrails going through the sky like cocaine lines.
[02:12:22.418 --> 02:12:22.938]  I don't know.
[02:12:22.979 --> 02:12:24.900]  That's completely normal, sir.
[02:12:25.020 --> 02:12:29.443]  I mean, I know up until 96, condensation trails disappeared in a few minutes max.
[02:12:29.483 --> 02:12:32.786]  Now they're there for five hours, get larger, and drift towards the ground.
[02:12:33.546 --> 02:12:37.889]  And they form in the middle of the summer at 3,000 feet, which is impossible.
[02:12:37.989 --> 02:12:38.810]  It's just normal.
[02:12:39.330 --> 02:12:40.331]  Everything's nutritious.
[02:12:40.351 --> 02:12:44.214]  It doesn't matter if children's textbooks are teaching them that they are spraying for our safety.
[02:12:45.844 --> 02:12:47.446]  It's just, everything's wonderful.
[02:12:48.046 --> 02:12:49.788]  I'm being sarcastic there, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:12:50.028 --> 02:12:54.372]  There is a lot of things going on, a lot of atmospheric experiments going on that's even been declassified.
[02:12:54.712 --> 02:12:56.974]  Okay, shifting gears back into the campaign.
[02:12:57.375 --> 02:12:58.736]  For the first time in two hours and...
[02:12:59.833 --> 02:13:00.513]  Good to be with you.
[02:13:00.814 --> 02:13:02.655]  What does this mean, what we've just witnessed?
[02:13:25.660 --> 02:13:31.362]  Well, I think it indicates that we're doing quite well, and we keep moving up.
[02:13:31.442 --> 02:13:35.063]  I was looking at a chart this morning, which, you know, in May they showed me at zero.
[02:13:35.103 --> 02:13:41.905]  Then the next time they measured the support, it was at four, and then it was six, and then eight, and now it's ten.
[02:13:42.365 --> 02:13:49.567]  So, and I looked at the chart for, say, Thompson as well as Giuliani, and their curves are straight down.
[02:13:50.423 --> 02:13:55.745]  So I would say there's every reason to be encouraged, especially with us going into a state like New Hampshire.
[02:13:55.765 --> 02:14:09.329]  The one category that we won, which is not a surprise, and that is the independent type of people, the people who, you know, think of themselves as not being locked into a strong party position.
[02:14:09.669 --> 02:14:11.090]  And we won that category.
[02:14:11.110 --> 02:14:17.652]  And when you think about that in New Hampshire, about half of the people in New Hampshire consider themselves independent.
[02:14:18.112 --> 02:14:22.614]  So I think we have a nice opportunity moving into the New Hampshire primary.
[02:14:23.094 --> 02:14:32.057]  Well, you know, you've been coming on this show, covering the campaign since the day it started, and I remember then, you know, it weren't even showing up in the polls.
[02:14:32.097 --> 02:14:36.799]  They still exclude you from a lot of polls, but you kept talking about trajectory, trajectory.
[02:14:37.259 --> 02:14:44.222]  This trajectory is better than it was even six months ago, and Jimmy Carter got, what, 1% in New Hampshire.
[02:14:44.822 --> 02:14:49.224]  Even mainline pundits are saying you're probably going to get second or third place, might even win.
[02:14:49.304 --> 02:14:53.946]  How are they going to ignore you when you walk away with New Hampshire or get second or third place?
[02:14:54.486 --> 02:14:56.048]  Well, it's going to be more difficult.
[02:14:56.068 --> 02:15:05.297]  I hope the embarrassment is more on them than on us because, you know, it looks like I won't be in that Fox debate on Sunday.
[02:15:07.078 --> 02:15:08.520]  But the people are going to be outraged.
[02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:12.544]  A lot of people are coming to our defense, including the Republican Party up there.
[02:15:13.244 --> 02:15:15.505]  We haven't heard the last word about that yet.
[02:15:15.665 --> 02:15:18.207]  Congressman, in fact, that was my next question.
[02:15:18.247 --> 02:15:18.807]  That's key.
[02:15:19.727 --> 02:15:23.209]  Fox had said they were having the top half of the candidates, the top five.
[02:15:23.489 --> 02:15:25.910]  You came in fifth place, hands down.
[02:15:25.950 --> 02:15:29.992]  They've got Giuliani, who got less than half your votes, in that debate.
[02:15:30.192 --> 02:15:31.473]  How can they justify that?
[02:15:31.513 --> 02:15:33.474]  Can you speak directly to that outrage?
[02:15:34.393 --> 02:15:35.954]  Well, they can't really justify it.
[02:15:36.074 --> 02:15:43.977]  I know what they're probably thinking is they don't want somebody to say some of the things that I say, especially about the war.
[02:15:44.037 --> 02:15:51.080]  They think this war is a wonderful thing and they support it and it's the strongest war station on television.
[02:15:51.800 --> 02:15:59.365]  And I don't think they want a conservative, you know, somebody that is not seen coming from the far left, espousing these positions.
[02:15:59.385 --> 02:16:10.613]  And of course, that's our benefit by defending the Constitution, that we will have some appeal to some liberals as well as conservatives, and that's what's so great about our Constitution.
[02:16:11.378 --> 02:16:15.359]  Congressman, so you don't have to hold, we're skipping this network break.
[02:16:15.399 --> 02:16:17.979]  Stations, don't worry, we'll play your break at the bottom of the hour.
[02:16:18.619 --> 02:16:26.261]  But we're going to skip this network break right now so that we can finish up with you, Congressman, here for the next... Let me warn you one thing.
[02:16:26.321 --> 02:16:32.622]  I see that I'm on a phone, a remote phone, and I'm going in a tunnel, so let's hope we don't lose you.
[02:16:32.842 --> 02:16:35.042]  Okay, you'll call right back if it cuts out, correct, sir?
[02:16:35.322 --> 02:16:37.143]  Right, I'll do that if we lose you, but go ahead.
[02:16:37.283 --> 02:16:37.863]  Okay, thank you.
[02:16:39.824 --> 02:16:42.546]  The situation with Fox News, as you said, they're desperate.
[02:16:42.826 --> 02:16:44.047]  The paradigm is shifting.
[02:16:44.347 --> 02:16:46.429]  You have all the independents and anti-war.
[02:16:46.709 --> 02:16:49.751]  The Republicans are intending to lose and pass the baton to Hillary.
[02:16:49.991 --> 02:16:51.132]  The money's all going to her.
[02:16:51.212 --> 02:16:52.032]  That's clear.
[02:16:52.413 --> 02:16:58.817]  So we know that it's either Ron Paul or basically the Democrats, and that's why they've got to keep you out.
[02:16:59.137 --> 02:17:03.220]  Now Sean Hannity's starting to kiss your hind end after slandering you.
[02:17:03.520 --> 02:17:05.441]  Now Beck's starting to grovel.
[02:17:05.742 --> 02:17:09.224]  Is that not a major shift that they now know that they are,
[02:17:09.784 --> 02:17:16.767]  I think there's no doubt about it, because people do act in their own self-interest.
[02:17:16.807 --> 02:17:25.411]  And even if they disapprove or dislike an individual or somebody's philosophy, if they realize it's eventually hurting them, they will shift gears.
[02:17:26.132 --> 02:17:33.715]  And we've noticed that before, because some of the people that want to interview me do it just because they think we've got a bigger audience.
[02:17:33.735 --> 02:17:37.357]  So that's the marketplace working, and I think that's a benefit.
[02:17:39.267 --> 02:17:40.629]  Again, I hear the music.
[02:17:40.649 --> 02:17:42.232]  We're going to skip this break, John, okay?
[02:17:44.102 --> 02:17:45.223]  Roger, Roger on that.
[02:17:45.263 --> 02:17:45.443]  Good.
[02:17:45.643 --> 02:17:46.944]  I just must be getting a computer then.
[02:17:47.264 --> 02:17:53.569]  Congressman, in the six, seven minutes we've got left with you until the bottom of the hour, other key areas, what people need to do right now.
[02:17:54.930 --> 02:17:56.611]  Some people are saying, oh, look, you only got 10%.
[02:17:57.452 --> 02:17:59.053]  The caucus is archaic.
[02:17:59.353 --> 02:18:03.636]  All the numbers, even Russert saying you should get third or second place in New Hampshire.
[02:18:03.696 --> 02:18:04.817]  This is a great victory.
[02:18:05.117 --> 02:18:06.758]  I'm not putting perfume on a pig.
[02:18:07.079 --> 02:18:10.181]  Some people don't seem to see what a victory this is.
[02:18:11.329 --> 02:18:18.071]  No, and, you know, we met with the hard-working young people, you know, did all the campaigning up in Iowa last night.
[02:18:18.111 --> 02:18:22.272]  There were a couple hundred of them, and they did not lack any enthusiasm.
[02:18:22.332 --> 02:18:30.895]  And they were up night and day doing this work, and a bunch of them were already packing their bags and going over to New Hampshire.
[02:18:30.955 --> 02:18:35.136]  So they haven't been discouraged, and they're the ones who are on the front lines doing all the hard work.
[02:18:35.689 --> 02:18:49.236]  Yeah, I think there was a little bit of initial discouragement on some of the blogs and sites, probably 20%, but pretty quick people pointed out the fact that, just like Ken Snyder at the first of the show, your campaign manager, said this morning, it's like the space shuttle.
[02:18:49.276 --> 02:18:54.259]  It uses 80% of its fuel just getting off the pad and up a few thousand feet.
[02:18:54.499 --> 02:18:57.320]  And then now you're really seeing the momentum get put on.
[02:18:57.540 --> 02:18:58.921]  You've definitely left the atmosphere.
[02:18:58.941 --> 02:19:02.043]  Yeah, and this...
[02:19:02.839 --> 02:19:03.899]  This is exactly the way.
[02:19:03.919 --> 02:19:05.220]  It grows exponentially.
[02:19:05.240 --> 02:19:15.083]  And if you look at our curves, where there's a number of supporters that we gained on the Internet, as well as the dollars coming in, it's always been self-perpetuating.
[02:19:15.463 --> 02:19:19.504]  And I think everything that we look there at is very optimistic.
[02:19:20.658 --> 02:19:23.780]  You know, you've talked a lot about how you didn't dream this would ever happen.
[02:19:24.080 --> 02:19:26.802]  Remember, I'm not tooting my horn, but I did believe in the revolution.
[02:19:26.862 --> 02:19:30.485]  I did know how big it was, and I want everybody else to know it will continue to grow.
[02:19:30.765 --> 02:19:44.615]  What is it like, and I know you're humble, but still, to see this whole historical process, regardless of what happens, don't we win just by being on the field and growing a liberty movement, the likes of which have never been seen?
[02:19:45.754 --> 02:19:48.455]  Yes, and a lot of the people understand that.
[02:19:48.595 --> 02:19:57.960]  I mean, everybody's upbeat and they want to win, but they're also very realistic to want to know what is the future, you know, regardless of what happens.
[02:19:58.020 --> 02:19:58.660]  What's going to happen?
[02:19:58.680 --> 02:20:00.101]  How can we keep working in this?
[02:20:00.121 --> 02:20:01.642]  How can we keep our group together?
[02:20:01.702 --> 02:20:04.283]  And how can we start supporting other candidates?
[02:20:04.583 --> 02:20:10.366]  And some individuals, especially young people, say, you know, I never even thought about the Federal Reserve, and I've gone and read about it.
[02:20:10.746 --> 02:20:12.627]  And then they become very excited about it.
[02:20:12.648 --> 02:20:17.071]  So I think we've really opened the eyes of a lot of people.
[02:20:17.171 --> 02:20:19.592]  So there's reason to be optimistic.
[02:20:19.973 --> 02:20:21.974]  Yeah, the real war is for hearts and minds.
[02:20:22.034 --> 02:20:24.296]  And now people realize that you can win.
[02:20:24.596 --> 02:20:25.977]  There's a good chance of you winning.
[02:20:26.017 --> 02:20:31.881]  And we pull out all the stops and pray and take action and give money and march in the street and hold up signs.
[02:20:32.221 --> 02:20:34.583]  But more than that, it's a war on for people's minds.
[02:20:34.643 --> 02:20:36.864]  It's an info war, isn't it, Congressman?
[02:20:37.045 --> 02:20:37.525]  Absolutely.
[02:20:38.525 --> 02:20:46.770]  Just to see you at the flashpoint or the zeitgeist of something that I foresee, no doubt in the future, is going to defeat the New World Order.
[02:20:46.790 --> 02:20:48.791]  Can you speak about the defeat of the New World Order?
[02:20:49.731 --> 02:20:51.612]  Well, we have to defeat them.
[02:20:52.133 --> 02:20:59.997]  You don't defeat them with weapons, and the weapon is the idea that we have to deal with.
[02:21:00.330 --> 02:21:05.272]  The old saying, ideas do have consequences, and I'm a strong believer in that.
[02:21:05.732 --> 02:21:06.933]  And that's where we're winning.
[02:21:07.293 --> 02:21:08.473]  There's no doubt about it.
[02:21:08.513 --> 02:21:18.718]  But I've known that before, and of course that's why I didn't know where we were in that effort, because a year ago I didn't think we were this far along.
[02:21:19.038 --> 02:21:25.621]  But I always would say that in the last 30 years there's been tremendous progress, not in Washington, but with the people.
[02:21:25.681 --> 02:21:28.662]  The people who have studied and understood and who are anxious to
[02:21:33.866 --> 02:21:37.729]  Well, I see this like one of the first big victories by Washington at Trenton.
[02:21:38.130 --> 02:21:40.351]  It was largely symbolic against the Hessians.
[02:21:40.932 --> 02:21:46.617]  I mean, that's just the victories we've had so far, Congressman, because it shows us that we can win.
[02:21:46.657 --> 02:21:49.099]  It shows us that we can come together.
[02:21:49.299 --> 02:21:53.082]  Would you say we're having some of our first big victories in the information war?
[02:21:53.763 --> 02:21:55.723]  Yeah, we certainly are.
[02:21:55.743 --> 02:22:04.005]  We show where we can be competitive because most everybody thought that you'd have to be part of the establishment to get any money and support.
[02:22:04.105 --> 02:22:12.526]  But the supporters have proven not only will they work hard and go out and do the late work that is necessary, but they'll also send in the money.
[02:22:12.946 --> 02:22:14.487]  And they'll also be very creative.
[02:22:14.527 --> 02:22:16.707]  Just think of all the creative things that have gone on.
[02:22:17.007 --> 02:22:20.028]  There's no way we can measure the number of dollars.
[02:22:20.328 --> 02:22:22.288]  If you wanted to count up all the hours and all the...
[02:22:22.948 --> 02:22:27.111]  In the last couple days until New Hampshire, what can we do to maximize getting people out of the polls?
[02:22:41.650 --> 02:22:43.612]  Well, I think it's more of the same thing.
[02:22:43.652 --> 02:22:49.536]  You know, some people are still volunteering and traveling to New Hampshire this weekend and right before the primary.
[02:22:50.897 --> 02:22:56.342]  In spite of the fact that we've raised a lot of money in the past and we're doing well, we always need to have money.
[02:22:56.382 --> 02:23:04.288]  But everybody, and I know your listeners are around the country, there's so much activity in some states that we haven't even had a chance hardly to think about it.
[02:23:04.468 --> 02:23:08.249]  Right now we're looking at South Carolina, New Hampshire, and Nevada.
[02:23:08.289 --> 02:23:10.630]  Are those the three key states right now, Congressman?
[02:23:10.670 --> 02:23:13.011]  Yeah, those are the ones that we're working on right now.
[02:23:32.293 --> 02:23:36.195]  Getting back to Fox here in closing, sir, and then I want to close with a war.
[02:23:36.215 --> 02:23:41.877]  If you have to make a prediction, I mean, I would say I think they're going to back off and include you.
[02:23:42.238 --> 02:23:45.939]  But also, then I think they don't want to pull their darling Giuliani off.
[02:23:46.399 --> 02:23:49.481]  But if he didn't get fifth place, how can they give him...
[02:23:50.021 --> 02:23:50.861]  We're good to go.
[02:23:50.961 --> 02:23:51.482]  We're good to go.
[02:24:13.962 --> 02:24:23.988]  Yeah, and I think the continual pressure on Fox is necessary and beneficial because they have to realize what the numbers are.
[02:24:24.488 --> 02:24:29.751]  And if it's hurting them, if it's not in their interest, I think they're in a bind now.
[02:24:29.831 --> 02:24:34.974]  I don't think they have any easy way out, and they've dug themselves into this situation.
[02:24:35.014 --> 02:24:39.217]  So hopefully they wake up and realize that they have to
[02:24:39.617 --> 02:24:42.540]  I love your line to Hannity when he lied in characteristic fashion.
[02:24:42.600 --> 02:24:45.544]  I've seen Hannity say all children should have microchips.
[02:24:45.844 --> 02:24:46.424]  Do we lose him?
[02:24:58.027 --> 02:24:58.367]  Okay, good.
[02:24:58.387 --> 02:24:58.968]  I heard it cut out.
[02:24:59.288 --> 02:25:01.070]  And that all the malicious quotes should be arrested.
[02:25:01.090 --> 02:25:04.353]  That's the type of person that Sean Hannity is.
[02:25:04.953 --> 02:25:07.095]  But I heard him try to claim that your fight was over the war.
[02:25:07.435 --> 02:25:11.519]  No, your fight on his show was over him saying we were cheating the poll.
[02:25:11.779 --> 02:25:15.402]  And I loved how you countered him and then pointed out that he really wasn't a real conservative.
[02:25:15.422 --> 02:25:15.883]  Congressman?
[02:25:16.583 --> 02:25:19.526]  Yeah, and that's what they don't want in them.
[02:25:19.566 --> 02:25:20.947]  I think that's why they're bothered.
[02:25:21.964 --> 02:25:25.266]  Once again, if we come from these views, they don't want the conservatives.
[02:25:25.486 --> 02:25:29.049]  It's okay if some left-winger has an opinion like this.
[02:25:29.089 --> 02:25:32.452]  They'll just write them all, all their left-wingers, and they don't support this war, you know.
[02:25:32.812 --> 02:25:36.555]  But when a conservative and a constitutionalist does it, it's a threat to them.
[02:25:36.895 --> 02:25:42.960]  So this is a threat at an intellectual level, and that translates into a political threat.
[02:25:43.300 --> 02:25:47.704]  And then once again, you know, there's profits to be made over their system of government.
[02:25:48.024 --> 02:25:57.632]  Well, what you and others have pointed out is you're just going up and pulling the sheep suit off of the wolf and showing that these guys aren't conservative.
[02:25:57.652 --> 02:26:02.877]  I mean, you told Hannity, well, I guess you are conservative on one or two points, but not on the majority.
[02:26:03.647 --> 02:26:04.007]  Yeah.
[02:26:04.407 --> 02:26:10.590]  He sort of grinned a little bit about it, but I think he realized what we were really saying there.
[02:26:10.751 --> 02:26:11.831]  Well, they've got a problem.
[02:26:11.851 --> 02:26:19.115]  You know, they can call us paltards and all those horrible insults against the mentally retarded that are very shameful and bigoted, but...
[02:26:19.875 --> 02:26:28.762]  You know, at the bottom line, the majority of conservatives are followers of the Constitution, and the Republican Party Plank of Texas sounds like Ron Paul pretty much wrote it.
[02:26:29.082 --> 02:26:39.690]  So they're the ones that are doing things that are unpopular, and then on top of it, they keep saying whenever you say I'm against the war, we shouldn't have attacked people that didn't attack us, they keep saying Iraq was involved.
[02:26:39.970 --> 02:26:41.171]  That doesn't hold water, does it?
[02:26:41.974 --> 02:26:42.655]  Not anymore.
[02:26:42.695 --> 02:26:44.817]  I mean, the president doesn't even say that anymore.
[02:26:44.897 --> 02:26:51.524]  He's finally admitted to it, and they're just embarrassing themselves, and hopefully they'll wake up.
[02:26:52.525 --> 02:26:56.810]  In closing, what did you think of the $20 million, right at $20 million for the quarter?
[02:26:57.737 --> 02:27:00.079]  Well, that was pretty impressive, pretty amazing.
[02:27:00.099 --> 02:27:04.602]  You know, I thought it was a pretty strong estimate that we made at the beginning.
[02:27:04.842 --> 02:27:13.828]  Our goal was to raise 12, and the supporters were so positive on that, they turned it into almost 20, so I would say that's very good.
[02:27:14.428 --> 02:27:15.269]  Very encouraging.
[02:27:16.069 --> 02:27:18.150]  How are you holding up with the grueling hours?
[02:27:18.211 --> 02:27:18.711]  Feeling good?
[02:27:19.523 --> 02:27:20.324]  I'm feeling good.
[02:27:20.484 --> 02:27:27.768]  It's some nights I'd like to get another hour or two of sleep, but we're up and at it again this morning.
[02:27:27.808 --> 02:27:29.689]  Congressman, God bless you.
[02:27:29.709 --> 02:27:30.269]  Go with God.
[02:27:30.289 --> 02:27:33.010]  We're all praying for you, and we'll see you when you win in New Hampshire.
[02:27:33.531 --> 02:27:34.151]  Thank you very much.
[02:27:34.371 --> 02:27:34.891]  God bless.
[02:27:34.971 --> 02:27:35.312]  Bye-bye.
[02:27:36.392 --> 02:27:37.333]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.793 --> 02:27:39.414]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.434 --> 02:27:43.016]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.919 --> 02:27:46.900]  Find your clean shop at bgfindashop.com.
[02:27:46.960 --> 02:27:47.580]  That's bgfindashop.com.
[02:28:15.982 --> 02:28:16.643]  We're good to go.
[02:28:46.013 --> 02:28:46.513]  Hi, neighbor.
[02:28:46.714 --> 02:28:48.595]  This is Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[02:28:49.175 --> 02:28:51.777]  Life is a gamble, but you can stack the deck.
[02:28:52.718 --> 02:29:01.945]  If you knew what I know about all the problems food will protect you from, you'd start immediately to put every effort and dollar you can get into the biggest supply of food possible.
[02:29:02.651 --> 02:29:16.834]  When the dollar and economy crash, when the imported and genetically poisoned food is all that's left, when the quarantine and bird flu hit, our only protection and only chance to be fearless is having control of our own supply of food and enough of it.
[02:29:17.114 --> 02:29:24.775]  But if you knew what we haven't yet discovered, you wouldn't waste time listening to the rest of this announcement before charging out and getting a serious food supply.
[02:29:25.315 --> 02:29:25.855]  Decide.
[02:29:26.275 --> 02:29:28.136]  It's food now or probably never.
[02:29:28.536 --> 02:29:29.816]  But can you afford to be wrong?
[02:29:30.496 --> 02:29:31.197]  Decide now.
[02:29:31.677 --> 02:29:32.457]  Place your bet.
[02:29:33.258 --> 02:29:34.719]  Can you afford to be wrong?
[02:29:35.099 --> 02:29:36.500]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[02:29:36.520 --> 02:29:36.680]  Call 800-409-5633.
[02:29:45.842 --> 02:29:54.245]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on Earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[02:29:54.545 --> 02:29:59.647]  At HempUSA.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the U.S.
[02:29:59.687 --> 02:30:00.247]  and Canada.
[02:30:00.547 --> 02:30:07.069]  At HempUSA.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC free.
[02:30:07.649 --> 02:30:10.911]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[02:30:11.051 --> 02:30:13.272]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[02:30:20.096 --> 02:30:23.398]  HempUSA.org is a bulk shipper starting with five pounds and up.
[02:30:23.598 --> 02:30:30.281]  To allow this food to work for you, call 908-691-2608 or go to HempUSA.org and order today.

[02:30:33.823 --> 02:30:36.945]  This superfood will be your greatest asset, so try it today.
[02:30:37.365 --> 02:30:37.846]  We're good to go.
[02:31:05.556 --> 02:31:10.378]  Oh man, this feels better than I think anything else in my life.
[02:31:11.639 --> 02:31:15.880]  I'm feeling very satiated right now.
[02:31:15.920 --> 02:31:17.821]  Let me just go ahead and have a moment of enjoyment.
[02:31:18.681 --> 02:31:21.082]  Oh, new world order.
[02:31:21.222 --> 02:31:23.103]  It's the same feeling.
[02:31:37.108 --> 02:31:43.333]  When I was like 15 years old and some big 20-year-old tough guy would come over, and I'd say, Hey, I don't want to fight you.
[02:31:43.914 --> 02:31:46.256]  And I wouldn't be in the fight.
[02:31:46.856 --> 02:31:59.907]  And just as soon as their fist slammed into my face, and as soon as blood went into my mouth, my teeth would just lock up, and I'd take them and I'd start ramming them, and I'd pick them up over my head and just slam them right into the concrete.
[02:32:01.669 --> 02:32:04.211]  You've got to stop it.
[02:32:06.397 --> 02:32:07.738]  It's just a shot away.
[02:32:07.758 --> 02:32:09.418]  You go ahead and run your charity.
[02:32:09.438 --> 02:32:10.719]  You go ahead and start your fight.
[02:32:11.699 --> 02:32:13.079]  We're going to run you right over.
[02:32:13.099 --> 02:32:19.402]  And let me tell you something else.
[02:32:20.222 --> 02:32:26.244]  When you're out there nerve-gassing our cities, when you go to that, thinking you're going to stop us, everybody's going to know it's you.
[02:32:26.884 --> 02:32:28.225]  They're going to know it's the New World Order.
[02:32:28.805 --> 02:32:31.406]  You're not going to be able to blame it on some militia air corps.
[02:32:34.326 --> 02:32:36.828]  You're not going to be able to blame it on the commies or the Arabs.
[02:32:38.329 --> 02:32:39.891]  Everybody's going to know who you are.
[02:32:39.911 --> 02:32:42.313]  Everybody's going to know you did it.
[02:32:44.214 --> 02:32:52.722]  Oh, it feels good to stand up against tyranny.
[02:32:53.703 --> 02:32:56.125]  It feels good to stop being a slave.
[02:32:56.165 --> 02:32:59.828]  It feels good to be a man, to be a woman, to be strong.
[02:33:00.856 --> 02:33:02.037]  To stop being cowards?
[02:33:02.397 --> 02:33:03.358]  To stop being weak?
[02:33:03.698 --> 02:33:04.299]  To commit?
[02:33:04.799 --> 02:33:06.460]  To be part of something real?
[02:33:07.861 --> 02:33:10.023]  Oh, feels good.
[02:33:11.784 --> 02:33:16.748]  Brother, sister, it's just a shot away.
[02:33:17.188 --> 02:33:18.749]  It's just a shot away.
[02:33:22.172 --> 02:33:23.953]  You know, it is shattered, my friends.
[02:33:24.654 --> 02:33:25.634]  Their new world order.
[02:33:26.535 --> 02:33:30.278]  All the king's horses crank it up
[02:33:35.026 --> 02:33:56.110]  Yeah, we're getting really close.
[02:33:56.130 --> 02:33:58.171]  We're getting our hands around your chicken necks.
[02:33:58.911 --> 02:34:00.171]  Closer every day.
[02:34:01.076 --> 02:34:01.996]  You just wait.
[02:34:02.036 --> 02:34:04.838]  You are going to fade away.
[02:34:05.098 --> 02:34:07.399]  Your whole peace system.
[02:34:22.080 --> 02:34:25.981]  The moment it forms will begin its total collapse.
[02:34:28.362 --> 02:34:30.762]  What do you see happening?
[02:34:31.523 --> 02:34:34.123]  You are fading away.
[02:34:35.784 --> 02:34:39.045]  And we, we are materializing.
[02:34:43.041 --> 02:34:44.543]  It's just a kiss away.
[02:34:51.390 --> 02:34:53.192]  Legends never die.
[02:34:54.954 --> 02:34:56.917]  Ideas never die.
[02:34:58.138 --> 02:35:00.000]  We are watching the birth of legend.
[02:35:05.858 --> 02:35:08.100]  I'm going completely wild today, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35:08.140 --> 02:35:09.781]  We brought you the head of the Ron Paul campaign.
[02:35:09.801 --> 02:35:10.741]  We brought you Ron Paul.
[02:35:10.941 --> 02:35:12.522]  We brought you Ron Paul's son.
[02:35:12.542 --> 02:35:14.804]  We brought you the king of drag racing for Ron Paul.
[02:35:15.324 --> 02:35:18.186]  And I'm going to be back Sunday, you can be sure of that, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:35:18.266 --> 02:35:20.828]  live, Central, with total Ron Paul coverage.
[02:35:20.848 --> 02:35:22.869]  I want to thank all of our affiliates that carry it.
[02:35:23.590 --> 02:35:33.739]  When the show starts over coming up in about 25 minutes, if you want to hear the analysis from Schneider, the latest info, Big Daddy Don Garlitz, Ron Paul, all of it, you just go to InfoWars.com.
[02:35:33.759 --> 02:35:35.620]  You can listen right there on the streams.
[02:35:36.101 --> 02:35:38.423]  Go to the InfoWars and click on Main Stream.
[02:35:39.278 --> 02:35:40.679]  The mainstream right there.
[02:35:40.699 --> 02:35:42.501]  And you can hear the show retransmitted.
[02:35:42.521 --> 02:35:44.122]  Instead of going wild and have a little bit of celebration.
[02:35:44.382 --> 02:35:49.946]  You know, I see men when I'm... I still go to family events and stuff while the Pats are on or the Cowboys.
[02:35:49.966 --> 02:35:54.269]  When they make a touchdown, everybody starts breathing heavy, gets excited, feeling like victory.
[02:35:54.509 --> 02:35:55.670]  And I'm just totally bored.
[02:35:56.911 --> 02:35:57.592]  Totally bored.
[02:35:57.612 --> 02:36:01.815]  You know, I'll go get a laptop or something and read some news articles, but still want to be with my family.
[02:36:02.475 --> 02:36:05.998]  And they all know about the dual order, but they're still under that tribal system of football rules.
[02:36:06.821 --> 02:36:09.462]  And see, when I... This is like Super Bowl for me, okay?
[02:36:10.162 --> 02:36:15.585]  I mean, to see us having victories, gaining ground, waking up, I have primitive feelings of serious endorphins.
[02:36:16.025 --> 02:36:17.405]  I mean, I'm on drugs right now, folks.
[02:36:17.505 --> 02:36:20.246]  I mean, my brain's saying, this is good, this is wonderful.
[02:36:20.627 --> 02:36:21.227]  I can see it.
[02:36:21.287 --> 02:36:22.647]  I realize it's Mortal Kombat.
[02:36:22.667 --> 02:36:23.648]  I know the danger I'm in.
[02:36:23.668 --> 02:36:24.248]  We're all in.
[02:36:24.528 --> 02:36:25.949]  I know we're going head up against them.
[02:36:25.989 --> 02:36:26.589]  I'm committed.
[02:36:26.669 --> 02:36:27.429]  It feels good.
[02:36:28.250 --> 02:36:29.110]  Oh, hold on.
[02:36:29.250 --> 02:36:30.210]  I'm feeling real good right now.
[02:36:30.551 --> 02:36:32.031]  I mean, I'm hired in a kite, folks.
[02:36:32.091 --> 02:36:33.672]  You're supposed to do good and fight evil.
[02:36:34.512 --> 02:36:35.853]  I don't need any pill, baby.
[02:36:35.973 --> 02:36:36.413]  I got it.
[02:36:41.119 --> 02:36:43.562]  In fact, play that Leonard Cohen because everybody knows.
[02:36:43.682 --> 02:36:44.783]  And then we're going to go to your calls.
[02:36:44.803 --> 02:36:46.664]  And then we're going to get the Air Blimp guy on.
[02:36:46.684 --> 02:36:47.345]  I want to plug him.
[02:36:47.785 --> 02:36:48.446]  That's the spirit.
[02:36:48.506 --> 02:36:49.487]  I'm not just going to plug.
[02:36:50.407 --> 02:36:53.990]  I'm not just going to plug the Ron Paul Air Corps and the 20-plus grand that's been raised in a day.
[02:36:54.010 --> 02:36:55.912]  Or how you can go to Ron Paul Air Corps.
[02:36:55.952 --> 02:36:57.713]  No, I'm going to support the Blimp and Daily Paul.
[02:36:57.753 --> 02:36:58.894]  Even Daily Paul doesn't link to us.
[02:36:58.914 --> 02:37:01.056]  Ron Paul comes on this show.
[02:37:01.256 --> 02:37:04.019]  We're all together in this fight against the New World Order.
[02:37:04.059 --> 02:37:06.481]  And I will tell you about RonPaulWarroom.com.
[02:37:07.085 --> 02:37:08.245]  You got my letter coming ready?
[02:37:10.186 --> 02:37:11.426]  Roll just a few minutes of it.
[02:37:11.566 --> 02:37:13.467]  Because this is the beginning of the New World Order going down.
[02:37:13.727 --> 02:37:14.767]  As everybody knows.
[02:37:15.467 --> 02:37:16.927]  And there's cops laughing right now.
[02:37:17.708 --> 02:37:18.968]  But you're going to take that shot.
[02:37:19.048 --> 02:37:20.728]  You're going to get real sick from your vaccine.
[02:37:20.748 --> 02:37:22.589]  You're going to give it to your 18-month-old baby.
[02:37:22.609 --> 02:37:24.209]  They're going to have a seizure and be retarded.
[02:37:24.229 --> 02:37:26.850]  And then you're going to remember I'm your friend and warn you about...
[02:37:27.572 --> 02:37:29.033]  You're with us even if you don't know it.
[02:37:57.472 --> 02:38:07.361]  Everybody knows that the boat is leaking Everybody knows that Captain Matt Everybody got this broken feeling Like their father or their doctor's dad
[02:38:18.792 --> 02:38:30.066]  Everybody's talking to their pocket Everybody wants a box of chocolate and a box of rose Everybody knows
[02:38:37.456 --> 02:38:41.359]  Get me the Howard Beale Network.
[02:38:41.399 --> 02:38:44.441]  Let's play a minute or two of that.
[02:38:44.481 --> 02:38:46.523]  Let's get that Howard Beale Network clip.
[02:38:46.803 --> 02:38:47.644]  Play a minute or two of him.
[02:38:47.664 --> 02:38:49.525]  Then I'm going to accelerate one minute per caller.
[02:38:49.765 --> 02:38:52.107]  Then we're going to Trevor Lyman and we're able to get him on the line.
[02:38:52.588 --> 02:38:55.890]  Part of this continual Ron Paul, the beginning of the revolution.
[02:38:55.930 --> 02:38:57.111]  We have just begun.
[02:38:58.692 --> 02:39:00.174]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:39:00.214 --> 02:39:01.855]  This is what it all comes down to.
[02:39:01.995 --> 02:39:04.057]  First, you've got to get mad.
[02:39:06.232 --> 02:39:07.673]  I don't have to tell you things are bad.
[02:39:08.153 --> 02:39:09.293]  Everybody knows things are bad.
[02:39:09.914 --> 02:39:10.674]  It's a depression.
[02:39:11.854 --> 02:39:14.816]  Everybody's out of work or scared of losing their job.
[02:39:16.156 --> 02:39:17.697]  The dollar buys a nickel's worth.
[02:39:18.157 --> 02:39:19.178]  Banks are going bust.
[02:39:19.258 --> 02:39:21.158]  Shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter.
[02:39:21.799 --> 02:39:23.399]  Punks are running wild in the street.
[02:39:23.439 --> 02:39:26.021]  There's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do and there's no end to it.
[02:39:27.641 --> 02:39:30.042]  We know the air is unfit to breathe.
[02:39:30.162 --> 02:39:31.563]  Our food is unfit to eat.
[02:39:32.341 --> 02:39:40.888]  We sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had 15 homicides and 63 violent crimes as if that's the way it's supposed to be.
[02:39:41.148 --> 02:39:42.269]  We know things are bad.
[02:39:42.349 --> 02:39:43.229]  Worse than bad.
[02:39:43.810 --> 02:39:44.550]  They're crazy.
[02:39:44.751 --> 02:39:47.793]  It's like everything everywhere is going crazy so we don't go out anymore.
[02:39:48.153 --> 02:39:55.079]  We sit in the house and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller and all we say is please at least leave us alone in our living rooms.
[02:39:55.119 --> 02:39:59.482]  Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel belt and radios and I won't say anything.
[02:39:59.682 --> 02:40:00.543]  Just leave us alone.
[02:40:00.743 --> 02:40:02.084]  Well, I'm not going to leave you alone.
[02:40:02.965 --> 02:40:04.126]  I want you to get mad.
[02:40:04.987 --> 02:40:06.248]  I don't want you to protest.
[02:40:06.349 --> 02:40:07.390]  I don't want you to riot.
[02:40:07.410 --> 02:40:10.333]  I don't want you to write to your congressman because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write.
[02:40:10.713 --> 02:40:15.018]  I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street.
[02:40:15.358 --> 02:40:17.901]  All I know is that first, you've got to get mad.
[02:40:18.342 --> 02:40:20.244]  You've got to say, I'm a human being.
[02:40:20.464 --> 02:40:21.665]  My life has value.
[02:40:23.287 --> 02:40:23.808]  I want you to...
[02:40:24.611 --> 02:40:25.772]  To get up now.
[02:40:26.713 --> 02:40:28.814]  I want all of you to get up out of your chairs.
[02:40:30.115 --> 02:40:40.463]  I want you to get up right now and go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell, I'm as bad as hell, but I'm not going to take this anymore!
[02:40:40.483 --> 02:40:43.125]  I want you to get up right now.
[02:40:43.845 --> 02:40:48.229]  Get up, go to your windows, open them and stick your head out and yell,
[02:40:50.716 --> 02:40:54.194]  I'm as mad as hell, but I'm not going to take this anymore!
[02:41:02.502 --> 02:41:08.226]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:41:08.526 --> 02:41:11.088]  Thank you for joining us during this transmission against tyranny.
[02:41:11.609 --> 02:41:13.690]  This is the front line, the tip of the spear.
[02:41:13.730 --> 02:41:14.411]  You found it.
[02:41:15.011 --> 02:41:16.272]  The Infowar.
[02:41:16.993 --> 02:41:19.154]  And Infowars.com.
[02:41:19.254 --> 02:41:21.896]  Ron Paul War Room dot com.
[02:41:23.348 --> 02:41:28.432]  For those criticizing the name Ron Paul War Room, you heard Ron Paul three times tell you it's an info war.
[02:41:28.873 --> 02:41:29.673]  It is a war.
[02:41:29.793 --> 02:41:30.734]  It is a campaign.
[02:41:30.774 --> 02:41:31.815]  It is a war room.
[02:41:32.216 --> 02:41:41.203]  And if you don't understand that life is a war against scum and filth and parasites that want to feed off you in high and low places, you've got another thing coming.
[02:41:41.223 --> 02:41:42.124]  Did you get a hold of Lyman?
[02:41:43.285 --> 02:41:44.105]  Or have you tried him yet?
[02:41:45.627 --> 02:41:47.008]  Yeah, let's just go ahead and go to a call right now.
[02:41:47.028 --> 02:41:47.608]  You haven't tried any?
[02:41:47.648 --> 02:41:48.029]  That's fine.
[02:41:48.549 --> 02:41:49.290]  Who's up first here?
[02:41:49.310 --> 02:41:50.511]  I'm going to blast through some of these.
[02:41:52.725 --> 02:41:54.687]  Jerry in Michigan, you're on the air worldwide, sir.
[02:41:54.707 --> 02:41:55.067]  Go ahead.
[02:41:55.487 --> 02:41:57.349]  Alex, it's a pleasure to be on with you.
[02:41:58.509 --> 02:41:59.630]  I'm also feeling great.
[02:41:59.690 --> 02:42:00.431]  I'm feeling alive.
[02:42:00.491 --> 02:42:02.452]  I'm feeling like a member of the human race.
[02:42:03.473 --> 02:42:08.997]  I just wanted to say real quick, I have a couple of points I'd like to make and just take my responses off the air.
[02:42:09.798 --> 02:42:15.142]  First, Ron Paul is what led me to Infowars.com, First Planet, your documentaries.
[02:42:16.142 --> 02:42:22.266]  I'm going to use a couple of words in conjunction that I thought I would never be able to use describing a politician.
[02:42:22.366 --> 02:42:26.709]  And that's honorable, decent, humble, and true to his word.
[02:42:28.189 --> 02:42:31.752]  For the first time, I think, in my adult life, I feel like a true American today.
[02:42:33.513 --> 02:42:34.533]  I want to get the word out.
[02:42:34.733 --> 02:42:38.536]  I just want to make a couple of points here about trying to wake people up.
[02:42:38.556 --> 02:42:40.937]  Because, you know, you start to tell them stuff, and they just don't want to believe it.
[02:42:41.097 --> 02:42:42.198]  They want to trust their governments.
[02:42:42.517 --> 02:42:43.457]  Bottom line, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:43:13.815 --> 02:43:14.255]  We're good to go.
[02:43:14.275 --> 02:43:14.716]  We're good to go.
[02:43:36.972 --> 02:43:37.832]  We don't have a choice.
[02:43:38.252 --> 02:43:40.893]  Now, we launched Ron Paul Air Corps over a month ago.
[02:43:40.913 --> 02:43:42.273]  I said, hey, that blimp's a great idea.
[02:43:42.293 --> 02:43:42.994]  We should support it.
[02:43:43.114 --> 02:43:43.894]  Put links up to it.
[02:43:43.954 --> 02:43:44.654]  Push free to give.
[02:43:44.694 --> 02:43:45.074]  You did.
[02:43:45.114 --> 02:43:45.634]  Good job.
[02:43:46.514 --> 02:43:52.336]  And I said, it's cheaper, but I know the blimp gets even more media attention, but to get over every city, hundreds of aircraft.
[02:43:52.356 --> 02:43:54.216]  A lot of other people have done it, gone with it.
[02:43:54.296 --> 02:43:55.737]  Others thought of it simultaneously.
[02:43:55.757 --> 02:43:57.917]  It's like ten guys invented radio the same day.
[02:43:58.237 --> 02:44:00.918]  I'm not even claiming to be the progenitor of it, just one of the fire starters.
[02:44:02.091 --> 02:44:03.852]  It doesn't matter to me if people make issue of it.
[02:44:04.853 --> 02:44:10.557]  The Ron Paul Blimp, of course, is the brainchild of Trevor Lyman, the same guy that took the ball and ran with it on November 5th.
[02:44:10.977 --> 02:44:16.261]  And, of course, the great guy with all of you out there who came up with the idea of the Tea Party Day.
[02:44:17.425 --> 02:44:19.386]  Broke all-time record, $6.8 million.
[02:44:19.786 --> 02:44:22.947]  We need to go and continue to fund the blimp, continue to fund operations.
[02:44:22.987 --> 02:44:33.531]  Ted Anderson has now got two banners, one already made, one already being delivered, for at least two aircraft for multiple days, starting Sunday through Monday and Tuesday, all over New Hampshire and then down into other states.
[02:44:33.591 --> 02:44:35.632]  Go to ronpaulaircorps.com, give there.
[02:44:35.892 --> 02:44:40.014]  But also go to the blimp and give there, because we're not in competition with each other.
[02:44:40.054 --> 02:44:42.174]  We're all together on the same page.
[02:44:42.354 --> 02:44:44.135]  That's why I'm so honored to have Trevor Lyman on with us.
[02:44:44.375 --> 02:44:46.336]  Trevor, how do we get over there to the blimp and give money?
[02:44:47.999 --> 02:44:48.520]  Hey, Alex.
[02:44:48.540 --> 02:44:49.160]  How are you doing?
[02:44:49.421 --> 02:44:50.081]  Yeah, that was right.
[02:44:50.162 --> 02:44:53.585]  RonPaulBlimp.com is the place to go for that.
[02:44:54.446 --> 02:44:58.230]  And, yeah, I'm excited about Ron Paul Air Corps as well.
[02:44:58.290 --> 02:45:02.494]  I actually checked out the page today, and I think it's pretty new.
[02:45:02.514 --> 02:45:05.978]  There's an image now of some of the banners that you guys are flying, and they're awesome.
[02:45:05.998 --> 02:45:06.699]  They're huge.
[02:45:07.740 --> 02:45:07.880]  So...
[02:45:09.318 --> 02:45:09.758]  I don't know.
[02:45:09.798 --> 02:45:10.459]  Ron Polaricor.
[02:45:11.419 --> 02:45:12.540]  Well, we appreciate you guys.
[02:45:12.580 --> 02:45:13.801]  Again, we're all on the same team here.
[02:45:13.841 --> 02:45:19.284]  Tell us about the blimp schedule, and then give us Trevor Lyman's take on what happened in Iowa and what's coming up in New Hampshire.
[02:45:21.425 --> 02:45:28.569]  Okay, well, the blimp right now is spending a little bit of time in Tampa, and then it's going to head back up towards, spend time in South Carolina, I guess.
[02:45:29.749 --> 02:45:30.330]  Although, you know...
[02:45:31.295 --> 02:45:37.699]  It can always change, but I guess every president that's ever won has taken South Carolina for the past hundred years or so.
[02:45:38.140 --> 02:45:42.783]  And by the way, Paul is doing the best in South Carolina of all the states.
[02:45:44.183 --> 02:45:46.025]  Yeah, he's definitely in the double digits.
[02:45:46.085 --> 02:45:48.266]  I'm not exactly sure where he is, but I know he's doing well.
[02:45:48.286 --> 02:45:50.187]  15 to 16 percent, yeah.
[02:45:51.308 --> 02:45:51.688]  Oh, is he?
[02:45:51.808 --> 02:45:52.649]  Wow, that's awesome.
[02:45:52.709 --> 02:45:53.329]  I hadn't heard that.
[02:45:55.050 --> 02:45:58.252]  Yeah, and so you asked about Iowa last night.
[02:45:58.272 --> 02:45:58.913]  Well, I heard from
[02:46:00.016 --> 02:46:01.618]  Wolf as well this morning on CNN.
[02:46:01.638 --> 02:46:05.601]  I guess they've been pretty good into Ron Paul about his performance last night.
[02:46:06.162 --> 02:46:10.506]  He won by a landslide with independent voters.
[02:46:10.766 --> 02:46:13.609]  And everybody knows New Hampshire is mostly independent voters.
[02:46:14.249 --> 02:46:15.630]  So it's looking pretty good here.
[02:46:15.670 --> 02:46:16.031]  In fact...
[02:46:17.310 --> 02:46:19.991]  All signs are that he'll do extremely well if not take the state.
[02:46:20.191 --> 02:46:20.731]  Explain that.
[02:46:20.751 --> 02:46:22.912]  New Hampshire is like 45% independent.
[02:46:22.972 --> 02:46:26.073]  The rest is split up between Republicans and Democrats, so it's the biggest section.
[02:46:26.453 --> 02:46:32.975]  And Ron Paul won in the Democratic demographic, suddenly can't talk, of independence.
[02:46:33.035 --> 02:46:36.376]  And so that bodes super well for New Hampshire.
[02:46:37.436 --> 02:46:37.897]  Exactly.
[02:46:37.917 --> 02:46:41.438]  He blew everybody away when they looked at the independent vote for the caucuses.
[02:46:41.458 --> 02:46:43.378]  He was way in the lead.
[02:46:43.398 --> 02:46:44.319]  I think he was at least 30%.
[02:46:46.302 --> 02:46:47.363]  I'm not positive.
[02:46:47.403 --> 02:46:48.544]  I think they were down around 8 or 9.
[02:46:49.024 --> 02:46:53.107]  Yeah, Giuliani was at 4.
[02:46:53.247 --> 02:46:54.468]  Paul was at 10.
[02:46:55.009 --> 02:46:56.790]  And so a huge gap.
[02:46:56.850 --> 02:47:03.835]  How can they have Giuliani at the final debate on Fox but not Paul when there's five spaces and Paul got into the top five?
[02:47:05.976 --> 02:47:07.838]  I think Ron Paul said it best.
[02:47:07.978 --> 02:47:08.598]  They're afraid.
[02:47:08.638 --> 02:47:09.479]  They're afraid of him.
[02:47:10.800 --> 02:47:13.201]  You know, they want to hold on to their power and they don't want to let it go.
[02:47:14.302 --> 02:47:15.203]  And, you know, they're...
[02:47:16.184 --> 02:47:17.265]  Trying to ignore them.
[02:47:18.386 --> 02:47:26.451]  Well, getting back to the blimp, because the blimp's getting massive attention everywhere it goes, and so it multiplies the effect of just having the millions of people see it from the ground.
[02:47:27.993 --> 02:47:29.374]  How are you doing on funding for the blimp?
[02:47:29.394 --> 02:47:29.934]  What do you need?
[02:47:31.615 --> 02:47:37.119]  Well, we're good until the 18th, but we need to work on getting that second month.
[02:47:37.139 --> 02:47:42.263]  The longer that we can fund it, the more we can plan, and that means taking advantage of things like football games.
[02:47:43.658 --> 02:47:48.239]  They require time, advanced time and planning because there's some competition for these things.
[02:47:48.599 --> 02:47:53.400]  And you've got to get the airship out to those games, pick those games.
[02:47:53.640 --> 02:48:01.061]  If you can't guarantee you're going to buy it for that next month, like for the Super Bowl or whatever, then you won't be able to get the blimp for that.
[02:48:02.022 --> 02:48:02.502]  Exactly.
[02:48:02.922 --> 02:48:06.062]  So if people can fund now for it, absolutely.
[02:48:06.122 --> 02:48:06.742]  That helps.
[02:48:06.842 --> 02:48:08.923]  It helps us maximize what we can get out of it.
[02:48:09.343 --> 02:48:09.783]  And that means...
[02:48:10.219 --> 02:48:18.465]  You know, you get a game, you get mentioned on national television four times, plus, I think, two shots of the blimp, you know, on national television.
[02:48:18.485 --> 02:48:23.789]  By the way, those championship games, ads go for about a million bucks or more a minute.
[02:48:24.409 --> 02:48:26.791]  Super Bowl, it's like $5 million a minute is what I've seen.
[02:48:27.151 --> 02:48:28.612]  Imagine getting the blimp mentioned.
[02:48:28.632 --> 02:48:30.954]  That's millions of dollars free, isn't it, Trevor?
[02:48:32.015 --> 02:48:32.195]  Right.
[02:48:32.355 --> 02:48:33.096]  That'd be excellent.
[02:48:33.756 --> 02:48:34.877]  Stay there, Trevor Lyman.
[02:48:36.069 --> 02:48:40.753]  The genius behind so much of the ideas that have gone supernova.
[02:48:40.993 --> 02:48:42.394]  Final second with you in a few calls.
[02:48:46.257 --> 02:48:47.658]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:47.678 --> 02:48:49.779]  A new world order.
[02:48:50.500 --> 02:48:54.542]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:48:54.643 --> 02:48:57.164]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[02:48:57.364 --> 02:49:00.487]  Wouldn't their objective be world domination?
[02:49:01.007 --> 02:49:03.429]  For thousands of years, their dark water grew.
[02:49:04.172 --> 02:49:11.528]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:14.522 --> 02:49:19.525]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:19.965 --> 02:49:23.468]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:23.828 --> 02:49:26.349]  Bill Vargas is making great progress toward the world government.
[02:49:26.410 --> 02:49:27.370]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:27.390 --> 02:49:28.331]  They're not after money.
[02:49:28.351 --> 02:49:29.431]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:29.632 --> 02:49:30.472]  They're after power.
[02:49:30.492 --> 02:49:31.513]  That's what happens.
[02:49:31.773 --> 02:49:39.978]  Order Endgame on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:49:40.098 --> 02:49:43.000]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:49:43.280 --> 02:49:44.460]  You have been warned.
[02:49:45.961 --> 02:49:48.561]  Ladies and gentlemen, Abigail's Addict.
[02:49:49.882 --> 02:49:54.763]  Tactio is the most exciting advance in media entertainment to come along in 50 years.
[02:49:55.143 --> 02:49:58.744]  Imagine not only hearing your favorite music, but also feeling it.
[02:49:59.004 --> 02:50:04.506]  Far beyond listening with just your ears, Tactio allows you to actually feel the music you're listening to.
[02:50:04.846 --> 02:50:09.487]  Tactio enhances and amplifies all the sensations that we enjoy when we listen to music.
[02:50:09.807 --> 02:50:16.270]  Keep listening to GCN for information on future Abigail's Attic concerts featuring Tactio and learn how you can save 50% on your Tactio purchase.
[02:50:43.243 --> 02:50:48.187]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:50:48.348 --> 02:50:53.572]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:50:53.873 --> 02:50:59.138]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:50:59.598 --> 02:51:00.679]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:51:01.059 --> 02:51:10.127]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[02:51:10.387 --> 02:51:12.009]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[02:51:12.229 --> 02:51:21.077]  All natural, earth-friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing, they're safe, and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[02:51:21.457 --> 02:51:23.539]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[02:51:25.280 --> 02:51:25.901]  We're good to go.
[02:51:57.345 --> 02:51:58.726]  Is it getting better?
[02:52:02.188 --> 02:52:04.070]  Or do you feel the same?
[02:52:05.070 --> 02:52:06.772]  Will it be easier on you?
[02:52:07.532 --> 02:52:09.894]  Will it make it easier on you now?
[02:52:10.134 --> 02:52:11.755]  But you got someone to blame?
[02:52:12.315 --> 02:52:14.117]  You got someone to blame.
[02:52:15.798 --> 02:52:23.063]  You said one love, one life, when it's one need.
[02:52:26.146 --> 02:52:28.887]  Let's go back to Trevor Wyman and then I'm going to jam in a few final calls.
[02:52:28.987 --> 02:52:32.568]  Retransmission starts in five minutes at InfoWars.com.
[02:52:32.608 --> 02:52:36.810]  We started off the show with, of course, the HeatherRompol2008.com campaign.
[02:52:36.830 --> 02:52:37.731]  And then, of course...
[02:52:42.179 --> 02:52:44.822]  I was their campaign chairman of Ken Snyder.
[02:52:44.982 --> 02:52:52.591]  Then we had the king of drag racing on Big Daddy, who's a big supporter and friend of Ron Paul going back 20 years.
[02:52:53.312 --> 02:52:57.717]  And then on top of that, we had Ron Paul's son, Rand Paul, and Congressman Ron Paul on today.
[02:52:57.997 --> 02:52:59.999]  And now we ended off with Trevor Lyman.
[02:53:00.780 --> 02:53:03.703]  Uh, Lyman, we're going to have you on Sunday on the show, if you can pop in, and Monday.
[02:53:03.723 --> 02:53:05.684]  We've got a new Money Bomb coming up January 21st.
[02:53:05.744 --> 02:53:07.285]  I'm going to support that one.
[02:53:07.766 --> 02:53:12.369]  And, uh, the Blimp, give them the websites again for the new Money Bomb, the Blimp, all of it.
[02:53:13.690 --> 02:53:21.697]  Sure, uh, the Blimp is ronpaulblimp.com, and the new, uh, Money Bomb, which is, uh, more about getting more numbers, is, uh, freeatlast2008.com.
[02:53:21.957 --> 02:53:22.778]  We want to do, uh,
[02:53:25.157 --> 02:53:31.822]  Of course, we want everyone to give as much as they can, but we're asking people to pledge just $10 so that we can show our numbers this time.
[02:53:32.202 --> 02:53:34.324]  Absolutely.
[02:53:34.344 --> 02:53:38.467]  Yeah, just $10 a piece to show tens of thousands of people, though, giving.
[02:53:39.607 --> 02:53:40.228]  Right.
[02:53:40.288 --> 02:53:43.290]  The last money bomb we had, I think it was near 70,000 donors.
[02:53:43.310 --> 02:53:48.053]  I'd love to clear 100,000, 150,000, whatever we can do just to fight the polls.
[02:53:48.774 --> 02:53:52.336]  The more people that we can go and it's like registering to vote with just $10.
[02:53:53.682 --> 02:53:57.826]  And showing the world that there are hundreds of thousands of us, if possible.
[02:53:58.147 --> 02:53:58.927]  That's what I hope for.
[02:53:58.967 --> 02:54:04.633]  And then, of course, that money bomb gets four, five, six, seven times the media coverage and what that money could even buy.
[02:54:04.713 --> 02:54:07.936]  So it's an exponential doubling effect.
[02:54:08.236 --> 02:54:11.059]  Trevor, we're going to talk to you Sunday, if you can do it, and Monday.
[02:54:11.079 --> 02:54:12.761]  And God bless you, sir.
[02:54:13.792 --> 02:54:14.132]  Thank you.
[02:54:14.453 --> 02:54:14.773]  Take care.
[02:54:14.793 --> 02:54:15.614]  There goes Trevor Lyman.
[02:54:15.874 --> 02:54:23.381]  And don't forget ronpaulaircorps.com, links on gcnlive.com, ronpaulwarroom.com, prisonplanet.com, truthnews.us.
[02:54:23.421 --> 02:54:24.382]  Go there and give as well.
[02:54:24.703 --> 02:54:27.085]  Ted's buying more banners, more airplanes to fly.
[02:54:27.105 --> 02:54:27.806]  He's going crazy.
[02:54:27.826 --> 02:54:29.127]  He was out in Iowa yesterday.
[02:54:30.048 --> 02:54:30.789]  We're doing it, folks.
[02:54:30.809 --> 02:54:32.010]  We're putting our money where our mouth is.
[02:54:32.070 --> 02:54:32.290]  I gave $1,000.
[02:54:32.330 --> 02:54:35.153]  And in closing, I don't know if you have a call or two.
[02:54:35.865 --> 02:54:36.506]  Buy my videos.
[02:54:36.526 --> 02:54:39.608]  I've not even been plugging them this week much because I've just been so busy.
[02:54:39.628 --> 02:54:40.869]  That's how we fund our operation.
[02:54:41.230 --> 02:54:43.471]  My staff, we're getting to be pretty good size.
[02:54:43.932 --> 02:54:44.632]  Get in game.
[02:54:44.853 --> 02:54:45.893]  Expose the North American Union.
[02:54:45.933 --> 02:54:46.394]  New world order.
[02:54:46.434 --> 02:54:46.914]  Get loose change.
[02:54:46.934 --> 02:54:47.335]  Final cut.
[02:54:47.355 --> 02:54:47.835]  All available.
[02:54:48.636 --> 02:54:51.638]  Infowars.com or prisonplanet.com.

[02:54:58.143 --> 02:54:58.804]  Who's first here?
[02:55:00.926 --> 02:55:01.506]  Who's first up?
[02:55:03.268 --> 02:55:04.028]  Chad in Iowa.
[02:55:04.289 --> 02:55:04.749]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:55:06.226 --> 02:55:06.466]  Hello.
[02:55:06.826 --> 02:55:08.527]  I just had three things real quick.
[02:55:08.567 --> 02:55:10.007]  I could probably wrap them up in just a minute.
[02:55:10.588 --> 02:55:11.288]  I was looking.
[02:55:11.908 --> 02:55:13.789]  I'm in Iowa, and I went to the caucus last night.
[02:55:14.269 --> 02:55:16.310]  I am so fired up, and that was so overwhelming.
[02:55:17.090 --> 02:55:20.711]  They were reporting 10%, but the exit poll said 37% or more.
[02:55:20.731 --> 02:55:23.032]  I went out and bought all the papers today.
[02:55:23.052 --> 02:55:29.654]  In front of the Wall Street Journal, there was something that said, FDA will rule cloned animals are safe to eat within a week.
[02:55:30.174 --> 02:55:34.456]  And also in the USA Today, passenger jets get anti-missile devices.
[02:55:34.932 --> 02:55:36.559]  Neither one of those fit well with me at all.
[02:55:37.021 --> 02:55:39.210]  I also called the round-call people and said, go, go, go.
[02:55:39.895 --> 02:55:44.158]  And anybody else listening out in Iowa, in April, we're getting the national ID card.
[02:55:44.539 --> 02:55:44.819]  I know.
[02:55:44.859 --> 02:55:45.659]  It's all happening.
[02:55:45.679 --> 02:55:49.202]  We're living in the twilight zone, and they give you HPV shots that give you cancer.
[02:55:49.963 --> 02:55:50.583]  That's admitted.
[02:55:50.703 --> 02:55:51.964]  John in Virginia.
[02:55:51.984 --> 02:55:52.885]  Last caller hit us.
[02:55:52.925 --> 02:55:53.805]  Sorry, Fred and others.
[02:55:54.086 --> 02:55:54.686]  John, go.
[02:55:54.746 --> 02:55:55.407]  You're tail gunner.
[02:55:55.847 --> 02:55:57.328]  Thank you, Alex, for taking my call.
[02:55:57.488 --> 02:56:02.051]  I speak only for myself, but I believe I'm alone in sharing this sentiment with you.
[02:56:02.432 --> 02:56:08.096]  I'm an unmarried man, but if I was a married man and I ever looked upon another woman in her nakedness,
[02:56:09.395 --> 02:56:13.318]  I would be ashamed to show my face in public, let alone run for President of the United States.
[02:56:13.618 --> 02:56:14.479]  I don't know what that means.
[02:56:14.519 --> 02:56:15.299]  I've got to go, sir.
[02:56:15.319 --> 02:56:16.480]  That makes no sense to me.
[02:56:17.080 --> 02:56:17.801]  Another woman.
[02:56:17.821 --> 02:56:18.561]  That sounds pretty weird.
[02:56:19.402 --> 02:56:20.463]  Listen, we're out of time.
[02:56:20.623 --> 02:56:22.004]  Retransmission starts now.
[02:56:22.264 --> 02:56:24.825]  Retransmission starts now at Infowars.com!
