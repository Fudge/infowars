[00:01:15.168 --> 00:01:19.849]  I want to thank the listeners, the sponsors, the Genesis Network, my great crew here in
[00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.477]  Mission Control in Austin, Texas and John Harmon up in Minnesota.
[00:01:25.098 --> 00:01:28.545]  We're getting April Gallup on either Sunday or Monday.
[00:01:29.767 --> 00:01:32.032]  We had her on the show
[00:01:33.311 --> 00:01:48.059]  If you remember about four or five months ago and we raised money for her on the air so she could sue the federal government for basically staging the terror attacks and she's got a very, very strong case.
[00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:54.622]  She was inside the Pentagon and so we're going to be covering some of that with Richard Gage in the next 50 minutes as well.
[00:01:55.002 --> 00:01:58.304]  Richard Gage a few years ago founded, I guess about a year and a half ago,
[00:01:58.824 --> 00:02:10.172]  Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth and he's gotten hundreds and hundreds of members of architects and engineers, structural engineers, to join his organization.
[00:02:10.472 --> 00:02:24.802]  There are also other organizations with hundreds of members of scientists and physicists and others coming out and showing that clearly Building 7 and Tower 1 and 2 on 9-11 were controlled demolitions and now
[00:02:25.783 --> 00:02:29.855]  Mr. Gage and many others have been vindicated because NIST's latest report
[00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.732]  has had to admit that there was free fall involved.
[00:02:34.752 --> 00:02:36.273]  They denied that in Building 7.
[00:02:36.633 --> 00:02:37.034]  Free fall.
[00:02:37.094 --> 00:02:39.715]  Falling at the speed of gravity as Richard has always said.
[00:02:39.735 --> 00:02:41.456]  They tried to spin it and claim 14 seconds.
[00:02:41.937 --> 00:02:47.300]  Now they've had to cut that in half and they're admitting that it did fall at free fall speeds.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:56.345]  And so, again, these scientific questions are making a lot of scholarly individuals with a lot of letters behind their name look at the raw data.
[00:02:56.786 --> 00:03:00.008]  Architecture engineers and scholars from 9-11 Truth and many others have gotten
[00:03:01.068 --> 00:03:12.313]  He's published reports in peer-reviewed journals detailing their findings, and some of the most prestigious peer-reviewed journals out there have found their findings to be conclusive.
[00:03:12.933 --> 00:03:19.416]  And he's fresh back from a tour of Europe to crowds of hundreds, and in some cases thousands, of people.
[00:03:19.796 --> 00:03:27.700]  He's also spoken in New Jersey and New York, brought into town by police officers and others to talk to folks, and he's gone through a lot
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.621]  of attacks to bring you this information.
[00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:55.086]  So I want to salute Richard Gage for all his fine work and commend him, another example of what a highly motivated, focused, professional person can do in the defense of not just this republic, but in the defense of those that were murdered on 9-11 and now the millions that have died around the world in the war on terror, the million-plus Iraqis that have died in the name of that lie and false flag is now a household term.
[00:03:55.926 --> 00:03:59.450]  Self-inflicted wound is now part of the nomenclature.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.521]  And now it comes out in major publications that Cheney wanted to stage terror attacks on U.S.
[00:04:04.561 --> 00:04:07.821]  ships just six months ago as a pretext to attack Iran.
[00:04:08.102 --> 00:04:10.442]  Thank God the military got the word out and stopped that.
[00:04:11.002 --> 00:04:13.303]  We now know that's why Admiral Fallon resigned.
[00:04:13.683 --> 00:04:15.403]  He was not going to be part of attacking U.S.
[00:04:15.443 --> 00:04:18.484]  ships with fake Iranian patrol boats.
[00:04:18.984 --> 00:04:28.666]  So a lot is happening and the truth is coming out on international television in England, in Germany, in Japan, in Russia, in the Middle East, in
[00:04:31.144 --> 00:04:31.544]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:33.005]  It's just great to be with you again.
[00:04:33.025 --> 00:04:33.786]  I can't tell you.
[00:04:33.806 --> 00:04:34.366]  I'm really excited.
[00:04:50.734 --> 00:05:02.161]  Well, we've gone over the evidence of controlled demolition in all three of the towers, and not just the eyewitnesses, but the scientific evidence, but can you recap the last six months since you were on with us?
[00:05:02.821 --> 00:05:10.766]  What has happened with NIST, having to go back on their previous reports, and where the scientific investigation is right now?
[00:05:12.267 --> 00:05:17.731]  Yes, well, NIST came out with their draft report of World Trade Center 7,
[00:05:18.584 --> 00:05:26.812]  The third high-rise that came down, not hit by an airplane, came down in the afternoon about 5.20 on 9.11.
[00:05:28.193 --> 00:05:42.127]  We'll talk about how it came down, but seven years later, finally, we have a draft report in August in which they try to document that it was 40% of gravity that the building came down.
[00:05:44.826 --> 00:06:13.304]  Upon questions by physicist David Chandler and scientist Dr. Stephen Jones, they publicly had to backtrack and fumble their way through the conference, and in their final report, which just came out in November last month, they acknowledge that in the first two and a quarter seconds, this 47-story building drops at free-fall speed, which is eight stories.
[00:06:13.965 --> 00:06:26.915]  Now, prior to this, in August, they said publicly that it couldn't have fallen free-fall speed, because had it, that would mean there would have been no structure.
[00:06:27.775 --> 00:06:33.379]  And so now they're acknowledging free-fall speed, but they're not saying, well, there must not have been structure there.
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:40.865]  In other words, what they're basically acknowledging to the 9-11 Truth Movement and the world is that
[00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:57.388]  The structure had to have been removed for those eight stories because a building cannot fall at free fall speed and convert all of its gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy and do any other work.
[00:06:58.067 --> 00:07:05.291]  It can't crush the 40,000 tons of steel that was in the building that was designed to resist any type of collapse.
[00:07:05.412 --> 00:07:22.362]  And again, this was the FEMA command bunker overbuilt for strength CIA, FBI, Defense Intelligence, more than 20 secretive federal agencies based there, their largest section offices outside of Virginia and Maryland in the world.
[00:07:23.564 --> 00:07:25.325]  Well, that was on the 23rd floor.
[00:07:25.385 --> 00:07:41.490]  Yes, it was a very highly secure bunker, complete with all that they needed in the way of electricity, water, and backup electricity, reinforced windows against all kinds of hurricanes and so forth.
[00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:45.251]  But all of this was abandoned on the morning of 9-11.
[00:07:45.751 --> 00:07:48.372]  For Tripod 2, a terror attack drill.
[00:07:49.741 --> 00:08:03.309]  They had already moved out the night before most of their operations out on the pier, as FEMA said, because they were doing a top-off two-drill, a tripod two-drill for a terror attack.
[00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:16.837]  Yes, we understand that there were hundreds of FEMA employees the day before 9-11 in preparation for a mock biochemical attack in downtown Manhattan, and we are wondering if that is just a coincidence or not.
[00:08:17.406 --> 00:08:26.130]  But the 550 architects and engineers who are demanding a real investigation do try to stick with the technical evidence.
[00:08:26.551 --> 00:08:34.215]  We're not conspiracy theorists, so we really do want others to investigate these matters, and we're glad that you're one of them.
[00:08:34.235 --> 00:08:40.738]  Let's talk about that matter next, of the 550, and now a year and a half joining your group, and how it's growing exponentially.
[00:08:41.138 --> 00:08:44.460]  But before we go there, I'm not an architect, I'm not an engineer.
[00:08:45.519 --> 00:08:48.903]  But this is the main show that brought up the Building 7 controversy day one.
[00:08:48.943 --> 00:08:58.254]  I remember hearing the news as I was driving in my car back to the studio saying they're going to bring Building 7 down, the Salomon Brothers, they're going to have a controlled demolition so it doesn't damage other buildings.
[00:08:59.535 --> 00:09:05.462]  Other people remember those reports, the false reports, BBC, Fox, CNN reporting it had fallen before it fell.
[00:09:06.403 --> 00:09:10.607]  But I wanted to be specific here, you know, watching what NIST has said.
[00:09:10.647 --> 00:09:13.630]  First, they said free fall is impossible because that would have to be explosives.
[00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:18.796]  Only explosives can, you know, do that because as it falls it takes time to crush, you know, the next level.
[00:09:19.236 --> 00:09:21.779]  And, you know, the basic science shows that.
[00:09:22.619 --> 00:09:25.362]  But we have footage now of the entire building falling.
[00:09:25.382 --> 00:09:29.285]  They love to show a video from a mile away with a building in the way.
[00:09:29.345 --> 00:09:35.570]  We only see the first 25 stories or so because the other 20-something stories are below the field of view.
[00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:37.532]  But in the other videos, we've timed it.
[00:09:38.252 --> 00:09:39.173]  I don't follow you.
[00:09:39.193 --> 00:09:41.656]  They acknowledge the free fall.
[00:10:00.713 --> 00:10:04.337]  But they certainly are being deceptive about the implications of that.
[00:10:04.377 --> 00:10:05.098]  Well, not just that.
[00:10:05.158 --> 00:10:07.340]  They're saying that the freefall was only partial.
[00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:11.784]  But when I watch the videos, it's a continual freefall, not just of 8 stories, but 47.
[00:10:12.145 --> 00:10:14.047]  Oh, yeah.
[00:10:14.147 --> 00:10:15.869]  No, it actually does slow down.
[00:10:15.929 --> 00:10:19.632]  I encourage your listeners to look at the 10-minute video.
[00:10:19.692 --> 00:10:21.234]  That says it's piling up at the bottom.
[00:10:22.168 --> 00:10:26.411]  Yeah, it begins to slow down after about two and a half seconds, just slightly.
[00:10:26.551 --> 00:10:36.217]  It is almost freefall for the next two, three seconds, and then it slows down a little bit more, so it is very close to freefall all the way down.
[00:10:36.237 --> 00:10:43.561]  But you would expect that, as it actually did meet resistance, they blow the floors out, it falls in on the rubble, and then you finally do have some slowing.
[00:10:44.241 --> 00:10:48.284]  Yes, they're counting on the weight of the building to be harnessed to do most of the destruction.
[00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:56.804]  So we have witnesses who have heard explosions at the base of the building, presumably those lower eight floors.
[00:10:57.064 --> 00:10:57.985]  We don't really know.
[00:10:58.005 --> 00:11:03.768]  A real investigation would get at the heart of this, and also to how they might have planted such explosives.
[00:11:03.808 --> 00:11:09.410]  But we do know that the lobby, they had access to the lobby, which is not occupied.
[00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:14.553]  They had access to the fifth and sixth floor, which is mechanical floors, complete access
[00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:21.703]  And through the elevator shaft, they could have had access to the entire core structure of the building without being detected.
[00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:23.124]  Yeah, it was a spook facility.
[00:11:23.465 --> 00:11:26.107]  Well, we're going to break and come back, and then I'm going to attempt to give you the floor.
[00:11:26.127 --> 00:11:30.610]  There's just so many issues I want to bring up here with Richard Gage, the founder of Architects and Engineers for 9-11.
[00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:35.454]  Truth, over 500 members now and growing of Structural Engineers and Architects.
[00:11:35.954 --> 00:11:40.457]  A very, very powerful group of accredited men and women.
[00:11:41.218 --> 00:11:54.709]  That cannot be ignored and we'll talk about the deceptions in the NIS reports and why they've been so deceptive and why they claim there was no molten metal when the government's own studies and their own photographs admit there was molten metal.
[00:11:55.189 --> 00:11:55.769]  Stay with us.
[00:11:57.771 --> 00:11:59.612]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:11:59.752 --> 00:12:04.934]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:12:05.114 --> 00:12:06.435]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:12:06.715 --> 00:12:14.878]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:12:15.118 --> 00:12:20.841]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:12:21.001 --> 00:12:22.803]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:12:22.843 --> 00:12:25.005]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:12:25.025 --> 00:12:29.389]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:12:29.569 --> 00:12:31.691]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:12:31.791 --> 00:12:39.678]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[00:12:57.521 --> 00:13:03.783]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:13:04.143 --> 00:13:05.823]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:13:06.792 --> 00:13:07.833]  But who is the enemy?
[00:13:08.333 --> 00:13:08.874]  Bin Laden.
[00:13:09.134 --> 00:13:10.155]  This is his M.O.
[00:13:10.175 --> 00:13:11.436]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:13:11.476 --> 00:13:13.157]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:13:13.497 --> 00:13:20.243]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:13:20.643 --> 00:13:21.083]  Some U.S.
[00:13:21.123 --> 00:13:26.808]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:13:27.468 --> 00:13:31.011]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:13:31.351 --> 00:13:41.218]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:13:41.459 --> 00:13:42.199]  Fabled enemies.

[00:13:50.445 --> 00:13:53.788]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:13:57.347 --> 00:14:03.552]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:14:04.012 --> 00:14:11.778]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:14:12.118 --> 00:14:20.004]  Is this a flaw of free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:14:20.304 --> 00:14:25.048]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:14:25.368 --> 00:14:30.089]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:14:30.589 --> 00:14:34.450]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:35.951]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[00:14:57.098 --> 00:15:02.400]  With rising unemployment and an economy that continues to fail comes an increase in crime.
[00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:04.581]  Are you safe when you walk to your car?
[00:15:05.141 --> 00:15:06.622]  Are your kids safe when they go out?
[00:15:07.262 --> 00:15:10.863]  Everyone needs something to give that extra edge in case of an attack.
[00:15:11.283 --> 00:15:14.785]  You need DPS pepper spray from MrDefense.com.
[00:15:15.265 --> 00:15:21.647]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray on the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around
[00:15:24.462 --> 00:15:27.643]  Your keychain is a great way to surprise a potential attacker.

[00:16:01.801 --> 00:16:03.122]  Okay, not wasting any time.
[00:16:03.203 --> 00:16:06.485]  Richard, continue with NIST and their deceptions.
[00:16:06.525 --> 00:16:09.227]  For those that don't know who NIST is, you might want to tell them who they are.
[00:16:09.728 --> 00:16:16.453]  And then I want you to spend some more time on the explosive growth and the published papers peer-reviewed by architects and engineers for 9-11 Truth.
[00:16:18.034 --> 00:16:20.236]  Yes, we have NIST.
[00:16:20.496 --> 00:16:28.623]  So, acknowledging freefall, we're asking all of your listeners to write letters to the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
[00:16:29.281 --> 00:16:40.604]  And mostly to government officials and media officials highlighting the dichotomy of what they're saying on the one hand and what they're not saying on the other.
[00:16:41.405 --> 00:16:45.726]  That this could only have been by explosive control demolition.
[00:16:46.726 --> 00:16:56.469]  It's critical that we get a real investigation and we're asking also all of your listeners to email every architect and engineer they can find
[00:16:56.994 --> 00:17:12.061]  And with the link to the video that documents this deception on the part of NIST, and the video can be found on YouTube at our account, which is AE911Truth.
[00:17:12.921 --> 00:17:16.843]  So go to YouTube and look for AE911Truth.
[00:17:17.243 --> 00:17:18.884]  You'll see a listing of our videos.
[00:17:18.904 --> 00:17:25.847]  The most prominent one that's received 20,000 hits is this physics professor, David Chandler.
[00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:38.023]  And by the way, this is our international boycott YouTube day today, because they've been censoring a lot of people.
[00:17:38.183 --> 00:17:46.453]  But on this day, I would encourage our listeners to go get the video you've posted there and post it on BlipTV, LiveLink, and a bunch of others.
[00:17:46.793 --> 00:17:49.795]  We're trying to get folks to have an exodus away from YouTube.
[00:17:49.815 --> 00:18:03.485]  We're going to stay on YouTube and keep fighting them, but to prepare people to try to build up some other big mega sites because of the censorship of YouTube openly announcing they are now run by the ADL and they decide what goes up and what doesn't.
[00:18:03.525 --> 00:18:08.669]  They've been banning my videos, restricting them, doing a lot of other bad things and banning a lot of 9-11 truth videos.
[00:18:08.689 --> 00:18:11.511]  But a side issue, the boycott of YouTube is going on today.
[00:18:11.811 --> 00:18:13.692]  That's why my channel is shut down right now.
[00:18:14.433 --> 00:18:15.694]  But please continue with
[00:18:16.474 --> 00:18:29.102]  Well, you brought up molten metal as well, and this is one of the critical pieces of evidence that is denied by NIST.
[00:18:29.162 --> 00:18:37.807]  In fact, before NIST took over the investigation, FEMA had done their own investigation, and interestingly enough,
[00:18:38.486 --> 00:18:49.157]  Their conclusion, first of all, is that fire, which is their best hypothesis of how this building came down, has a very low probability of occurrence.
[00:18:50.238 --> 00:18:54.703]  What do you do when your best hypothesis has a low probability of occurrence?
[00:18:55.203 --> 00:18:57.045]  You look for another hypothesis.
[00:18:57.432 --> 00:19:11.156]  In fact, they found some evidence and documented it very well for the explosive control demolition with a new type of material, an incendiary called thermite.
[00:19:12.176 --> 00:19:16.997]  This stuff, there's evidence all throughout the World Trade Center of thermite.
[00:19:17.097 --> 00:19:24.479]  In fact, there is several tons of molten metal found by the first responders
[00:19:25.032 --> 00:19:42.023]  And how do you get all this molten steel when we're talking about thousands of degrees above what we know is going on?
[00:19:42.043 --> 00:19:45.545]  I mean, the people are standing in the wounds in the buildings, waving their arms.
[00:19:45.605 --> 00:19:46.586]  It's not melting them.
[00:19:46.646 --> 00:19:49.568]  How does it melt these big four-foot-round girders?
[00:19:49.588 --> 00:19:53.070]  Then we have the video of the molten steel, the proper coloration,
[00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:57.531]  The studies have been done, pouring out, founting out, like a foundry.
[00:19:57.551 --> 00:20:05.252]  We have the firefighters on TV saying it was just like a foundry, like inside a volcano, just molten metal everywhere.
[00:20:05.272 --> 00:20:07.232]  And then for weeks we have this molten metal.
[00:20:08.152 --> 00:20:09.733]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:20:09.813 --> 00:20:17.154]  And FEMA documents the melting of the steel, the hot sulfur corrosion attack, turning three-quarter inch girders into Swiss cheese.
[00:20:17.374 --> 00:20:22.875]  This is documented by Abul Hazan Astani, the structural engineer who had unlimited access out there.
[00:20:23.246 --> 00:20:26.008]  Where does all of this melted steel come from?
[00:20:26.348 --> 00:20:34.292]  And more, even more importantly, what did NIST do with this documentation in appendix C of the final FEMA report in May of 2002?
[00:20:34.332 --> 00:20:36.573]  They eject it.
[00:20:36.673 --> 00:20:38.774]  It is not a part of the official record.
[00:20:38.954 --> 00:20:42.176]  They cannot afford to acknowledge this molten metal.
[00:20:42.236 --> 00:20:48.559]  In fact, their lead structural engineer, John Gross, denies that there's any evidence or witnesses of molten metal.
[00:20:48.719 --> 00:20:51.461]  He denies this publicly when there's dozens of witnesses.
[00:20:51.849 --> 00:20:57.853]  And plenty of photographic evidence, as you cited, flowing out of the South Tower near the jet plane impact.
[00:20:57.893 --> 00:21:07.219]  The local student group, PNAC, a project for a new American citizen, they, a few years ago, questioned him about that, and he said there is no molten metal.
[00:21:07.619 --> 00:21:15.764]  It didn't matter if they had the video they were trying to show him, and now there's all this footage of molten metal, but still they're in denial about it.
[00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:20.672]  They're going to have to at some point acknowledge that it exists and come up with some excuse.
[00:21:20.992 --> 00:21:30.896]  What we've heard so far is, oh, well, the fire was down in the debris and it was so insulated that it got hotter and hotter and hotter, which is physically impossible.
[00:21:30.916 --> 00:21:32.037]  That's not how it works.
[00:21:32.117 --> 00:21:33.598]  Things cool in entropy.
[00:21:34.078 --> 00:21:34.938]  All right.
[00:21:35.018 --> 00:21:36.479]  We'll be right back with Richard Gage.
[00:21:36.539 --> 00:21:38.560]  Long segment coming up in your phone calls on 9-11, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:39.060]  Stay with us.
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:39.700]  We'll be right back.
[00:21:47.535 --> 00:21:50.519]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:21:51.461 --> 00:21:54.145]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:57.333 --> 00:22:02.154]  The new multipolar inline and portable water system, new from HempUSA.org.
[00:22:02.374 --> 00:22:10.756]  Now you can restructure and degas your water supply from any source, rendering chemicals harmless to the human body by polarizing the molecular structure.
[00:22:10.976 --> 00:22:15.677]  Imagine a softer, smoother water with increased oxygen that helps the nervous system and brain.
[00:22:15.897 --> 00:22:22.698]  There are no filters to buy and it can be taken anywhere, making it our number one new product from HempUSA.org.
[00:22:22.958 --> 00:22:29.180]  This water system will descale all piping, hot water heaters, and appliances due to heavy buildup of hard minerals.
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:40.205]  Detoxification may result with restructured water by easily entering the fine capillaries of the human body by dissolving stones and toxins, with extreme positive effects on plants, vegetables, and fruits.
[00:22:40.265 --> 00:22:45.147]  Improved taste, color, size, and yield with approximately 30% less water usage.
[00:22:45.287 --> 00:22:48.808]  There are multiple sizes also available for farms and commercial use.
[00:22:49.048 --> 00:22:52.570]  Visit hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608.
[00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:55.132]  That's 908-691-2608.
[00:22:55.252 --> 00:23:02.796]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:23:03.057 --> 00:23:04.357]  And we knew what to do.
[00:23:04.377 --> 00:23:06.138]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:23:06.379 --> 00:23:12.802]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:23:13.423 --> 00:23:18.566]  Whitman, EPA Director on the 18th, made a statement.
[00:23:19.554 --> 00:23:21.975]  That the air was safe to breathe.
[00:23:22.315 --> 00:23:29.117]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:23:29.397 --> 00:23:32.458]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:23:32.578 --> 00:23:37.800]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:40.981]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:23:41.421 --> 00:23:48.163]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD
[00:23:51.726 --> 00:23:57.850]  Attention.
[00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:00.872]  This is an extremely urgent self-reliant news bulletin.
[00:24:01.232 --> 00:24:07.677]  If you have ever wanted to produce your own cheaper than dirt survival food, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:24:08.317 --> 00:24:08.958]  Here is why.
[00:24:09.798 --> 00:24:19.763]  This network has just learned of a new video course that reveals the secrets of how to safely prepare and store all types of survival foods in an event of social unrest and food shortages here in the U.S.
[00:24:20.224 --> 00:24:22.605]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[00:24:22.985 --> 00:24:25.066]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[00:24:25.086 --> 00:24:25.587]  this fall?
[00:24:26.067 --> 00:24:26.587]  Don't wait.
[00:24:26.987 --> 00:24:30.609]  Learn the food shortage skills that can keep you and your family alive in a crisis.

[00:25:02.105 --> 00:25:03.146]  It is December 19, 2008.
[00:25:04.848 --> 00:25:09.593]  Richard Gage, the founder of Architects and Engineers, for 9-11 Truth is our guest.
[00:25:10.534 --> 00:25:23.067]  Next hour, we're going to get into the attacks on property rights and hunting, farming, organic farms, organic small country stores being raided by SWAT teams.
[00:25:24.332 --> 00:25:30.876]  Now having your own chickens, I guess, will be an al-Qaeda crime here in this police state where they don't want any of us to be self-sufficient.
[00:25:31.396 --> 00:25:32.477]  Richard Gage is our guest.
[00:25:32.497 --> 00:25:37.140]  Your call is coming up here in just about ten minutes at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:40.682]  Please, only on 9-11 and government-sponsored terror issues.
[00:25:40.722 --> 00:25:42.643]  Questions for our guest.
[00:25:45.605 --> 00:25:48.786]  Richard, specifically,
[00:25:51.144 --> 00:25:53.546]  Where do you see 9-11 Truth going in the future?
[00:25:53.586 --> 00:25:55.267]  We have April Gallup filing a suit.
[00:25:55.387 --> 00:26:03.254]  She was in the Pentagon, one of the heroes, showing with her evidence that it's an inside job, and then how they persecuted her when she started asking questions.
[00:26:04.495 --> 00:26:07.337]  It seems that 9-11 Truth is only growing and growing and growing.
[00:26:08.218 --> 00:26:08.818]  Richard Gage?
[00:26:09.859 --> 00:26:13.022]  It's growing by millions every year, as a matter of fact.
[00:26:14.459 --> 00:26:17.982]  We had, as you mentioned, the Europeans brought us out.
[00:26:18.022 --> 00:26:20.404]  We had national coverage in Madrid.
[00:26:21.805 --> 00:26:26.708]  We were sell-out crowds in half of the European cities.
[00:26:27.709 --> 00:26:36.054]  They're more awake over there and the media is less controlled in many of the areas of Europe, not all by any means.
[00:26:36.655 --> 00:26:42.479]  We expect to have a thousand architects and engineers signed on demanding a real investigation.
[00:26:43.004 --> 00:26:58.973]  By late summer, and we will take the petition to Washington, D.C., and take lots of members of the 9-11 Truth Movement with us, hold a press conference at the National Press Club, and present the petition to Congress.
[00:26:59.773 --> 00:27:04.516]  So we hope to also have hundreds of our architects and engineers there with us.
[00:27:04.856 --> 00:27:06.897]  So that's a big push for us.
[00:27:07.217 --> 00:27:07.857]  There's a large
[00:27:09.884 --> 00:27:25.014]  The conference for 9-11 happening in Australia, also in November, and a very important conference in Denver, American Transparency, you must know about that one, coming up in February.
[00:27:25.495 --> 00:27:28.777]  So there's a lot going on, a lot happening.
[00:27:29.577 --> 00:27:36.782]  I wanted to make sure, I realize I left some of your listeners hanging relative to this molten metal, because some people say, well, who cares?
[00:27:37.202 --> 00:27:37.823]  What does that mean?
[00:27:38.487 --> 00:27:41.169]  It turns out that this is not melted steel.
[00:27:41.569 --> 00:27:44.892]  It turns out that it's not aluminum from a jet airplane.
[00:27:45.832 --> 00:27:47.173]  It's molten iron.
[00:27:47.333 --> 00:27:48.034]  It's iron.
[00:27:48.194 --> 00:27:54.459]  This stuff is brought up, and iron, while a component of structural steel, this is not that.
[00:27:54.639 --> 00:27:57.061]  This is the byproduct of thermite.
[00:27:57.381 --> 00:28:03.165]  This is pure iron with elements of aluminum, sulfur, manganese, fluorine,
[00:28:03.707 --> 00:28:07.229]  And even 1,3-diphenylpropane, interesting, is found.
[00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:10.592]  Eric Schwartz of the EPA says they've never found that before.
[00:28:11.092 --> 00:28:22.539]  All of this is the key chemical signature of thermite, a high-tech incendiary which is used by the military to cut through steel like a hot knife through butter.
[00:28:22.599 --> 00:28:25.781]  And not just thermite, but thermate, the specific type.
[00:28:25.801 --> 00:28:29.524]  They don't just find the thermate residue, they're finding the thermite residue.
[00:28:30.436 --> 00:28:40.597]  And it's not just a thermite or thermate residue either, it is a very high-tech form of thermite, thermate, with nano-sized particles found in unignited chips.
[00:28:41.244 --> 00:28:44.106]  Red on one side, gray on the other in all of the dust samples.
[00:28:44.247 --> 00:28:44.787]  Unbelievable.
[00:28:45.307 --> 00:28:48.610]  So we're even finding part of the unignited explosive, the thermate.
[00:28:49.190 --> 00:29:04.923]  And then it turns out some of the people at NIST just so happen to be former NASA experts in thermate couplers, explosive bolts, for separating intercontinental ballistic missiles and large booster components in their second and third stages.
[00:29:05.483 --> 00:29:09.767]  Just so happens that there's just a few experts in the world on thermate.
[00:29:11.459 --> 00:29:15.140]  They just so happen to be the people over at NIST.
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.000]  That's interesting.
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:21.722]  It's very interesting, and you can read more about that on our website, on the technical articles.
[00:29:21.802 --> 00:29:24.082]  Kevin Ryan has done some incredible work.
[00:29:24.862 --> 00:29:35.445]  Our website is ae911truth.org, and people can also purchase the DVD to get more information.
[00:29:35.465 --> 00:29:38.025]  We have a two-hour DVD on all of this evidence.
[00:29:38.105 --> 00:29:40.286]  It's all laid out for you.
[00:29:41.565 --> 00:29:42.045]  Absolutely.
[00:29:42.065 --> 00:29:43.686]  Tell folks they can get that there at the site.
[00:29:45.447 --> 00:29:53.771]  Yeah, right on the left side of the website, AE911Truth.org, the evidence is listed for you on the right side.
[00:29:54.111 --> 00:29:57.052]  There's plenty of very important articles.
[00:29:57.112 --> 00:30:05.196]  The PowerPoint presentation that I have used in 80 different presentations around the country and in Europe and Canada
[00:30:07.795 --> 00:30:16.837]  What is the establishment trying to do to stop you or discredit you?
[00:30:16.897 --> 00:30:23.778]  I know that Mythbusters is doing a two-hour special, National Geographic is doing a special.
[00:30:23.818 --> 00:30:29.540]  They wanted me to be part of it, but it's a guy that does hit pieces on Patriot groups and on JFK researchers.
[00:30:30.925 --> 00:30:33.287]  And so there's no point in being interviewed so he can edit it all together.
[00:30:33.707 --> 00:30:36.088]  I believe you were interviewed by these guys, though.
[00:30:36.969 --> 00:30:40.311]  So there's a whole group, and that's just two of the shows.
[00:30:40.331 --> 00:30:44.013]  There's several other big shows being produced trying to counter us right now.
[00:30:45.574 --> 00:30:59.963]  Yes, and I'm not so sure that the gentleman that interviewed me for the National Geographic two-hour TV 9-11 documentary is producing a hit piece on this particular subject.
[00:31:00.433 --> 00:31:06.097]  He has seemed fairly well-convinced to me and gave us every benefit of the doubt.
[00:31:06.558 --> 00:31:08.119]  It was a very friendly interview.
[00:31:08.139 --> 00:31:08.839]  I was surprised.
[00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:10.681]  Have you seen the films he's made?
[00:31:11.521 --> 00:31:11.681]  No.
[00:31:12.262 --> 00:31:12.702]  Get ready.
[00:31:13.503 --> 00:31:14.363]  Okay.
[00:31:14.424 --> 00:31:17.286]  Time and time again, people will say, oh, the BBC was so nice.
[00:31:17.346 --> 00:31:20.428]  And I go, no, I've seen... I go look at what they've made in the past.
[00:31:20.488 --> 00:31:24.771]  He is a specialist in going after alternative media.
[00:31:25.432 --> 00:31:28.094]  And I did a whole show about his inside the
[00:31:30.615 --> 00:31:37.006]  you know limo special that aired on Discovery Channel a few weeks ago and just the whole thing is a
[00:31:39.437 --> 00:31:41.958]  We'll cross our fingers and hope for the best, I guess, huh?
[00:32:09.548 --> 00:32:11.009]  Absolutely, we will do that.
[00:32:11.449 --> 00:32:13.470]  Incidentally, for some reason my computer's gone dead.
[00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:14.771]  It had the collars on it.
[00:32:17.012 --> 00:32:18.393]  The network, I am that to the guys.
[00:32:18.413 --> 00:32:20.253]  Will you guys bring me a sheet with those collars on it?
[00:32:20.274 --> 00:32:23.935]  Because I want to go to those here in just the next few minutes.
[00:32:26.471 --> 00:32:39.798]  Richard, there's so many other facets to this, other points in your research that you haven't made that we need to go over, and then secondarily, second, I would like you to speak about the explosive growth of your organization.
[00:32:41.339 --> 00:32:41.999]  Oh, you bet.
[00:32:42.659 --> 00:32:52.605]  Well, relative to Building 7, let's complete this, because it's not just the fact that we have free fall, which is only one of the many smoking guns.
[00:32:53.125 --> 00:32:54.265]  This building, 47 stories high,
[00:32:55.826 --> 00:33:04.649]  It begins immediately its descent, and it falls symmetrically and smoothly, nearly straight down, and almost into its own footprint.
[00:33:05.089 --> 00:33:21.694]  This is a feat that only a handful of companies in the world can even accomplish, and it is in itself proof of controlled demolition, because in order to bring a building straight down, you have to take out, in this case, the 23 core columns within a tenth of a second of each other,
[00:33:22.496 --> 00:33:24.597]  Synchronistically timed, floor-by-floor.
[00:33:24.878 --> 00:33:27.579]  That's the only way you can get it to come down straight.
[00:33:27.879 --> 00:33:31.501]  So that is a second smoking gun, if you will.
[00:33:32.121 --> 00:33:43.488]  Indeed, also, we have throughout the whole Ground Zero, all of this dust that blanketed lower Manhattan has these tiny iron-rich microspheres smaller than a human hair, most of them.
[00:33:44.448 --> 00:33:47.690]  This could only have come from an aluminothermic event.
[00:33:48.021 --> 00:33:51.562]  Because they have the chemical ingredients, once again, of ignited thermite.
[00:33:51.882 --> 00:34:07.866]  So, there's no way that all of this dust, 20 minutes away in the Brooklyn Bridge, up on top of the skyscrapers, two, three blocks away, and filling all of the apartments, could have these billions of these spheres.
[00:34:07.906 --> 00:34:09.306]  Well, how do they get to be spheres?
[00:34:09.346 --> 00:34:12.007]  Well, liquid does this.
[00:34:12.367 --> 00:34:14.587]  Its surface tension forms itself into a sphere.
[00:34:15.327 --> 00:34:17.168]  So, in an explosive event,
[00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:18.431]  I don't
[00:34:40.008 --> 00:34:42.049]  These explanations make no sense.
[00:34:42.109 --> 00:34:47.933]  And they can't magically have the spheres be made up of the exact compounds in explosive thermite.
[00:34:48.873 --> 00:34:59.220]  That's right, and attached to the unignited chips as found in the dust by Dr. Stephen Jones, and documented in peer-reviewed journals like the
[00:34:59.781 --> 00:35:02.764]  The Open Civil Engineering Journal and others.
[00:35:03.965 --> 00:35:05.306]  Now, what effect is this having?
[00:35:05.326 --> 00:35:10.371]  I mean, you've gone, in a year and a half, upwards of 500 plus members.
[00:35:10.411 --> 00:35:14.695]  I interviewed you in the film Truth Rising, and then you had a couple hundred members.
[00:35:15.475 --> 00:35:22.062]  Now you've got over 550 members, and as these are published in peer-reviewed journals, that's not you guys writing this.
[00:35:23.877 --> 00:35:30.813]  Being seconded by prestigious journal after journal, it seems like the establishment's got a big problem here, Richard.
[00:35:33.122 --> 00:35:44.072]  Yeah, I hope so, but if we're having the dialogue in a vacuum and it's not being published by the mainstream media, then is it happening?
[00:35:44.552 --> 00:35:49.156]  If a tree falls and no one's there to hear it in the forest, does it make a sound?
[00:35:49.196 --> 00:35:54.040]  Well, in the past it didn't, but now the alternative media is annihilating the mainstream media.
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:58.304]  That's why they're moving in with Internet, too, in an attempt to shut down the original free web.
[00:35:59.625 --> 00:36:01.266]  Yeah, and it's a huge problem.
[00:36:01.366 --> 00:36:03.508]  I mean, we have to become our own media.
[00:36:03.588 --> 00:36:12.074]  I know you're the major proponent of this, and we have to get this evidence out to the American people, and it's going mostly, I think, word of mouth.
[00:36:12.735 --> 00:36:27.306]  In addition to alternative media, internet, it is happening, and there is pressure from underneath, if you will, on the mainstream media, so every once in a while they have to respond to it, or they look like they're not doing their job, and they don't want to have that appearance, do they?
[00:36:27.714 --> 00:36:40.401]  So we get National Geographic to respond, whether it's a hit piece or not, BBC doing their hit piece, and people get to see Building 7 coming down for the first time, because it's never been played after the first day on 9-11.
[00:36:42.101 --> 00:36:42.682]  Absolutely.
[00:36:42.922 --> 00:36:46.644]  Talk about your organization itself that you founded, and then I want to go to phone calls.
[00:36:48.785 --> 00:36:49.045]  Yes.
[00:36:49.745 --> 00:36:54.408]  We are a non-partisan group of 560, I think, now.
[00:36:57.345 --> 00:37:23.739]  They're architects and engineers, licensed and or degreed and we are looking at all of these pieces of evidence and virtually every architect or engineer we show this information to ends up agreeing with us if they're willing to sit down with it for a half an hour or an hour or in some cases two hours is the length we've been speaking.
[00:37:24.266 --> 00:37:27.587]  They go, my God, why didn't I know about this?
[00:37:27.828 --> 00:37:34.490]  Well, there's lots of reasons for that, but do you agree with the technical, science-based, forensic evidence?
[00:37:34.991 --> 00:37:36.051]  Yeah, I have to!
[00:37:37.051 --> 00:37:52.158]  Then let's get an investigation to find out what the other issues are, such as, obviously, if this is thermite, and Al-Qaeda didn't have access to these buildings, Al-Qaeda didn't have access to this high-tech
[00:37:54.795 --> 00:38:04.620]  We're talking about some kind of other operation, and the architects and engineers don't speculate too much beyond that, because it's beyond our technical credibility.
[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:18.407]  But what we can do is provide the tools for your listeners to take the AE911Truth.org link, with the power of our 560 technical professionals, to their friends, to the media, to their congressmen,
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:19.561]  I don't know.
[00:38:41.738 --> 00:38:44.039]  Folks that go out and just say, hey, this is pretty wild stuff.
[00:38:44.079 --> 00:38:45.359]  Tell me what you think about it.
[00:38:45.859 --> 00:38:50.281]  And then you depoliticize it and then they watch it or tell them, hey, this is controversial.
[00:38:50.321 --> 00:38:52.801]  This is, you know, suppressed stuff.
[00:38:53.401 --> 00:38:56.502]  So that they'll watch it and then you unlock a mind and that is priceless.
[00:38:57.523 --> 00:38:59.463]  I want to go to some phone calls for you now.
[00:39:00.143 --> 00:39:02.064]  Let's talk to Warren in California.
[00:39:02.124 --> 00:39:06.885]  Warren, you're on the air with the founder of Architects and Engineers for 911 Truth, Richard Gage.
[00:39:07.406 --> 00:39:07.686]  Hello.
[00:39:08.046 --> 00:39:08.346]  Yes, sir.
[00:39:08.871 --> 00:39:11.672]  Yeah, I want to make this short but it's going to take a while.
[00:39:12.032 --> 00:39:33.301]  I went on Google and I put in Global Hawk and I went down to images and there's about 20 or 12 pages of thumbnail pictures of various pictures of the Global Hawk and about a third of the picture down it says Global Hawk hits Pentagon and it has an explosion and there's a website under it.
[00:39:33.661 --> 00:39:37.183]  Then on the next page there's one
[00:39:37.642 --> 00:39:42.685]  Global Hawk, Pentagon, 9-11, and it's painted an American Airlines paint scheme.
[00:39:43.866 --> 00:39:53.352]  Well, there's a lot of debate about what happened at the Pentagon, and the way they covered up the videos, the way the witnesses said they smelled cordite, or basically gunpowder, explosives.
[00:39:55.733 --> 00:40:01.436]  That is a major issue there, and we've covered it, and we've got April Gallup coming on next week, who's filed suit over this.
[00:40:01.456 --> 00:40:05.479]  She was in the Pentagon, and didn't see any plane, didn't see any wreckage, and they told her to shut up about it.
[00:40:06.986 --> 00:40:17.713]  But, you know, the stronger evidence really is the controlled demolition, and then separately the fact that our government, which is illegitimate, has staged terror attacks over and over again that are declassified and admitted.
[00:40:17.733 --> 00:40:26.119]  I mean, there are hundreds of examples where they admit they staged terror attacks on our troops, on our ships, or on other countries to blame it on their enemies.
[00:40:26.499 --> 00:40:29.821]  We have an illegitimate government that's doing this, a group of terrorists.
[00:40:30.382 --> 00:40:34.665]  And so I find that to be the strongest politically, to make people understand it, that, well, hey,
[00:40:36.039 --> 00:40:44.169]  If I'm a cop and I'm looking for a serial killer, and we find a murder that has the same M.O.
[00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:47.874]  of the other serial killings, then we go look at the usual suspect.
[00:40:48.014 --> 00:40:51.058]  These guys have done this over and over again, so that's why we do that.
[00:40:51.518 --> 00:40:53.301]  Richard Gage, your comments on the Pentagon?
[00:40:55.905 --> 00:40:58.928]  You're right, it is a little bit of a mess, Alex.
[00:40:59.268 --> 00:41:02.510]  There's clearly cover-up going on at the Pentagon.
[00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:08.374]  They had hundreds of cameras that would have told us what did or didn't hit the Pentagon.
[00:41:08.835 --> 00:41:14.759]  And they're not releasing them, only the unclear five frames.
[00:41:15.719 --> 00:41:16.640]  It's a joke.
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:24.786]  They came and took the FBI, after five or ten minutes, the cameras from the hotel and the gas station nearby.
[00:41:25.836 --> 00:41:43.513]  So, we have enough very hard evidence, as you mentioned, at the three worst structural failures in modern history, the high-rises, that have not been properly investigated, and then that have their own set of cover-ups to go with.
[00:41:43.753 --> 00:41:49.038]  And so, there's some controversy within the 9-11 Truth Movement about the Pentagon.
[00:41:49.784 --> 00:42:00.672]  So our particular organization focuses on the high-rises instead, where there is very little controversy about the mechanisms for how these buildings were taken down.
[00:42:00.752 --> 00:42:01.492]  All right, Warren.
[00:42:01.512 --> 00:42:02.253]  Thank you so much.
[00:42:02.313 --> 00:42:03.474]  Anything else from California?
[00:42:05.077 --> 00:42:05.818]  All right, he's gone.
[00:42:06.438 --> 00:42:07.699]  Let's talk, well we're going to go to break here.
[00:42:07.719 --> 00:42:13.264]  We're going to come back quickly to Randy, Ralph, we're going to go to Derek first, who says he's a structural engineer.
[00:42:13.304 --> 00:42:14.745]  I don't know if he agrees or disagrees.
[00:42:15.186 --> 00:42:16.547]  Michael, Leno and Kevin in mass.
[00:42:17.428 --> 00:42:23.953]  In the next hour we've got a bunch of land rights feudalism issues as we're all basically being driven off the land, micromanaged.
[00:42:24.213 --> 00:42:32.260]  The king has sent out swarms of agents to eat out our substance as the founders complained in 1776 when the Declaration of Independence signed July 4th.
[00:42:33.362 --> 00:42:34.986]  But I want to hold Richard Gage.
[00:42:35.027 --> 00:42:36.250]  Richard, I know you have a busy schedule.
[00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:37.814]  Can you stay five minutes to the next hour?
[00:42:37.994 --> 00:42:38.997]  Oh, you bet, Alex.
[00:42:39.198 --> 00:42:39.679]  Okay, good.
[00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:40.661]  And then we're going to get...
[00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:45.473]  The President of Property Rights, Congress of Missouri, Russell Wood on.
[00:42:46.114 --> 00:42:50.098]  They want you to have to register your premises to be able to hunt on your own land and pay fines and fees.
[00:42:50.138 --> 00:42:57.244]  And they say it's a privilege to hunt on your own land, separate from having to get all the little permission slips, the licenses from the king.
[00:42:57.805 --> 00:43:00.367]  Toxic heavy metals negatively impact our health.
[00:43:00.607 --> 00:43:05.572]  They're in the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, the products we use, and the objects we touch.
[00:43:05.632 --> 00:43:06.473]  We're good.
[00:43:35.555 --> 00:43:35.815]  I think so.
[00:43:57.594 --> 00:44:03.979]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:44:04.339 --> 00:44:06.320]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:44:06.981 --> 00:44:08.041]  But who is the enemy?
[00:44:08.542 --> 00:44:09.062]  Bin Laden.
[00:44:09.342 --> 00:44:10.223]  This is his ammo.
[00:44:10.243 --> 00:44:11.644]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:44:11.684 --> 00:44:13.365]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:44:13.705 --> 00:44:20.450]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:44:20.850 --> 00:44:21.291]  Some U.S.
[00:44:21.331 --> 00:44:26.975]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:44:27.655 --> 00:44:31.157]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:44:31.177 --> 00:44:41.422]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:44:41.642 --> 00:44:42.382]  Fabled enemies.

[00:45:01.091 --> 00:45:03.214]  But why settle for bland, tasteless food?
[00:45:03.654 --> 00:45:04.735]  Why settle for less?

[00:46:35.237 --> 00:46:38.559]  Hi Alex, first I'd like to thank you and Richard for spreading and keeping the 9-11 movement strong so long.
[00:46:38.619 --> 00:46:41.121]  I know people are saying it's seven years or it's been a while.
[00:46:58.283 --> 00:47:03.526]  My question for Richard, I'd just like to know the name of some of your books, and I had a comment after that as well.
[00:47:04.446 --> 00:47:09.029]  Well, several videos have been made with Richard's work, and we have those available at InfoWars.com.
[00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:15.152]  Their latest film is 9-11 Blueprint for Truth, available at AE911Truth.org.
[00:47:15.192 --> 00:47:15.453]  Richard?
[00:47:16.493 --> 00:47:17.394]  Yes, that's true.
[00:47:17.414 --> 00:47:18.574]  It's all right there.
[00:47:18.614 --> 00:47:19.715]  We have not written a book yet.
[00:47:22.216 --> 00:47:35.902]  Well, related to that question, I was just wondering, because I purposely go to the library to ask for, you know, 9-11-related books, and, you know, so when the library's crowded, I'll get weird looks from the librarian, because I'll know the title of the book, and I'll say, well, what books do you have from Vincent Bugliosi?
[00:47:36.182 --> 00:47:38.503]  So then she has to say the title, and people look at me like, what?
[00:47:38.823 --> 00:47:40.364]  You know, President Bush wanted for murder?
[00:47:40.424 --> 00:47:48.768]  And, you know, I kind of pull a backwards trick for that, but, um, you know, I first off recommend going to see Endgame first for anybody that's getting into this, because
[00:47:49.255 --> 00:47:57.480]  If you watch it, it kind of starts and gives you, you know, it resets the history so you really know what happened before you go see all this natural stuff and you can see how it relates.
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:59.762]  Yeah, it gives it to you in a historical perspective.
[00:47:59.802 --> 00:48:00.242]  Got to jump.
[00:48:00.262 --> 00:48:00.922]  Good to hear from you.
[00:48:01.183 --> 00:48:04.164]  Let's go to a structural engineer, Derek from Texas.
[00:48:04.565 --> 00:48:05.826]  You're on the air with Richard Gage.
[00:48:05.866 --> 00:48:06.506]  Go ahead, Derek.
[00:48:07.246 --> 00:48:08.227]  Hi, Alex, Richard.
[00:48:08.267 --> 00:48:12.690]  Thank you so much for letting me on your air and thank you so much for all the great work that y'all do.
[00:48:13.986 --> 00:48:16.328]  As a correction, I'm not a structural engineer.
[00:48:16.848 --> 00:48:19.810]  That's usually a civil engineer's test.
[00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:24.313]  My screen just said that, so somebody said that or something close to that to the person answering the phone.
[00:48:25.133 --> 00:48:36.180]  Yeah, I'm a mechanical engineer, but I do, as a certified welding inspector, go to building and structures and review the structural engineer's recommendations and enforce the contract documents by making sure
[00:48:36.716 --> 00:48:37.597]  Uh, that they get followed.
[00:48:37.617 --> 00:48:45.021]  And I'll write a report that says that the structural engineer's recommendations are followed or not followed and make recommendations as to how they can be remedied.
[00:48:45.602 --> 00:48:51.365]  Um, but I want to get to the, uh, quick and skinny about the NIS report that came out just a couple months ago.
[00:48:51.385 --> 00:49:04.934]  What they're suggesting is that this column 79 on floor 23, which had many attachments, this is a column that was attached to, or excuse me, a floor beam, which they said expanded from a linear thermal expansion from these office fires.
[00:49:05.504 --> 00:49:12.107]  As far as my knowledge, the only thing inside these offices are normal consumables, like books, papers, carpet, etc.
[00:49:12.207 --> 00:49:22.311]  Which smolder and burn at 800 degrees, 900 degrees, all hail thermal expansion, a new scientific development in the history of building fires.
[00:49:23.292 --> 00:49:34.017]  Yes, and they're suggesting that all this overcame a connection at Column 79, which was also attached to four other floor beams, as well as the deck connections, which are all welded.
[00:49:35.461 --> 00:49:36.581]  Which are about every two feet.
[00:49:36.702 --> 00:49:37.622]  They're all welded.
[00:49:38.222 --> 00:49:39.863]  And, you know, there's many, many connections.
[00:49:39.903 --> 00:49:47.306]  Not to mention a five-inch thick concrete slab that has reinforcement of steel rebar or post-tension tendons.
[00:49:48.226 --> 00:50:03.592]  What we need to do is have a finite element method survey that's applied to this geometry and then put different initial load conditions in and run the FEA software and say, we already know that this is silly, but a good FEA survey will prove this is silly.
[00:50:03.942 --> 00:50:08.725]  And this is something that I promoted on Neocon Radio, and I enjoy doing it when I can.
[00:50:08.805 --> 00:50:17.209]  Well, the criminals running the government, it's not our government, they engage in a cover-up of everything, so we can't find out specifically.
[00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:18.070]  Richard Gage.
[00:50:19.557 --> 00:50:25.782]  We have to get the information from NIST in order to do the FEA, and they are closing it.
[00:50:25.862 --> 00:50:27.884]  It is not available whatsoever.
[00:50:27.904 --> 00:50:33.989]  They've locked it up, and this is a public investigation, and this information must be made public.
[00:50:34.009 --> 00:50:34.949]  All right, stay there.
[00:50:34.969 --> 00:50:35.830]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:35.850 --> 00:50:40.614]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:50:41.975 --> 00:50:44.317]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:48.941]  It is a big idea.
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:51.141]  A New World Order.
[00:50:51.841 --> 00:50:56.285]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:50:56.345 --> 00:50:58.907]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:50:59.567 --> 00:51:01.789]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:04.811]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:51:05.552 --> 00:51:12.878]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:51:15.888 --> 00:51:20.851]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:51:21.332 --> 00:51:24.814]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:51:25.214 --> 00:51:27.676]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:51:27.756 --> 00:51:28.917]  Most people have no idea.
[00:51:28.937 --> 00:51:29.697]  They're not after money.
[00:51:29.717 --> 00:51:30.778]  They have all the money they need.
[00:51:30.998 --> 00:51:31.719]  They're after power.
[00:51:31.979 --> 00:51:32.819]  That's what they're after these years.

[00:51:41.805 --> 00:51:44.427]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:51:44.647 --> 00:51:45.708]  You have been warned.
[00:51:49.891 --> 00:51:51.812]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:52.293 --> 00:51:55.055]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:11.328 --> 00:52:18.853]  Final segment with Richard Gage, Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth, commenting on what the last gentleman was saying.
[00:52:18.893 --> 00:52:20.654]  Richard, before we go to a few final calls.
[00:52:21.835 --> 00:52:27.258]  Well, he was highlighting the unviability of the thesis of NIST.
[00:52:27.599 --> 00:52:31.501]  First of all, the photographic evidence of the fires on the 12th and 13th floor
[00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:37.374]  Indicate that the fires were out for the last hour and a half of the life of the building.
[00:52:37.695 --> 00:52:52.229]  And yet, their fire simulations fraudulently shows massive fires around Column 79, as you suggested, for well more than the 20 minute duration that a fire can exist in any one place.
[00:52:53.188 --> 00:52:57.672]  Because it consumes the low quantities of consumables and moves on.
[00:52:57.732 --> 00:53:02.935]  It creeps around, but they have this continuous, across the board, massive inferno.
[00:53:04.036 --> 00:53:11.802]  Yes, and so this massive inferno, let's say, okay, maybe it was there, but it's not just one building, it's not just one building, it's three doing this.
[00:53:12.722 --> 00:53:13.303]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:53:13.403 --> 00:53:20.728]  But in Building 7, what they're saying is that this fire elongated the beams, pushed the girder off its seat on the column,
[00:53:21.218 --> 00:53:26.161]  And then that caused floor 13 to fall, and 12, 12 to fall, and 11, etc.
[00:53:26.201 --> 00:53:32.926]  for nine floors inside the building, leaving column 79 unbraced, and so then it buckles.
[00:53:33.266 --> 00:53:39.070]  But all of this action would have deformed the exterior of the building, and that's not what happens.
[00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:41.171]  But it does happen in a computer model.
[00:53:41.292 --> 00:53:44.854]  Interestingly enough, there's severe warping, indentation, and bulging.
[00:53:45.385 --> 00:53:49.007]  And tipping, actually, of the upper part of the building.
[00:53:49.227 --> 00:54:07.939]  They could not get their computer model to match what actually happened in the video, because clearly that building would have tipped over in any kind of collapse caused by fire, and that's why they don't even show us what happens above about the 20th floor, because it was clearly tipping as a result of all the bulging and indentation.
[00:54:07.999 --> 00:54:10.200]  All right, let's go to a final call.
[00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:11.221]  Mike in Illinois.
[00:54:11.701 --> 00:54:13.042]  Mike, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:54:14.451 --> 00:54:14.671]  Yes.
[00:54:14.811 --> 00:54:15.452]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:54:15.492 --> 00:54:16.192]  I appreciate it.
[00:54:16.852 --> 00:54:18.293]  Richard, I have a couple questions for you.
[00:54:18.313 --> 00:54:21.375]  I'm going to try to make it brief because I know the time variable here.
[00:54:21.795 --> 00:54:23.976]  I remember seeing the trade centers come down.
[00:54:24.036 --> 00:54:29.600]  They look like trees being turned into sawdust from the top down, which was sort of incredible to me.
[00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:34.122]  And I know that I don't actually believe that the thermite could alone do this.
[00:54:34.162 --> 00:54:36.023]  There had to be some other facet to it.
[00:54:36.043 --> 00:54:37.504]  You have 550,000 tons being turned into dust, which
[00:54:43.243 --> 00:54:44.726]  Which is just like unbelievable.
[00:54:44.766 --> 00:54:46.730]  I understand it was built in a bathtub.
[00:54:47.170 --> 00:54:50.056]  So if this had fallen into this bathtub, it might have cracked.
[00:54:51.844 --> 00:54:52.664]  Well, here's the deal.
[00:54:52.844 --> 00:55:06.367]  Instantly as it starts collapsing Tower 1 and 2, not just 7, instantly as Tower 1 and 2 start detonating with blast squibs, clearly 4, 5, in some cases 10 floors below, it's pulverizing with explosive force.
[00:55:06.627 --> 00:55:14.989]  Little fires don't eject pyroclastic flows of pulverized office furniture, desks, people blown into tiny pieces.
[00:55:15.029 --> 00:55:15.609]  Richard Gage.
[00:55:16.369 --> 00:55:19.630]  And they don't eject 4 and 20 ton perimeter steel beams
[00:55:20.681 --> 00:55:27.466]  55 miles an hour exiting instant acceleration out of the sides of the Twin Tower landing 600 feet away.
[00:55:27.846 --> 00:55:28.727]  That doesn't happen.
[00:55:29.528 --> 00:55:36.793]  But I think the caller's suggesting that there's something in addition to high-tech thermite, which becomes very explosive, by the way.
[00:55:37.093 --> 00:55:39.675]  So we don't know because the tests aren't available to us.
[00:55:39.696 --> 00:55:41.817]  This is very new stuff.
[00:55:42.037 --> 00:55:46.241]  We just know the official story doesn't match the science on any area.
[00:55:47.745 --> 00:55:48.446]  That's correct.
[00:55:48.786 --> 00:55:54.329]  But it could be that the explosive nature of the high-tech thermite could be enough.
[00:55:54.509 --> 00:55:55.589]  I mean, we don't really know.
[00:55:55.849 --> 00:56:02.092]  We don't necessarily have evidence of high-energy explosives like C4 or RDX.
[00:56:02.693 --> 00:56:06.975]  So there could be something else going on that's high-tech and more explosive.
[00:56:07.868 --> 00:56:08.388]  Who knows?
[00:56:08.448 --> 00:56:10.849]  We have the evidence for high-tech thermite.
[00:56:10.869 --> 00:56:11.589]  Let's run with it.
[00:56:11.829 --> 00:56:12.730]  Thank you, Mike.
[00:56:12.770 --> 00:56:13.290]  We're out of time.
[00:56:13.330 --> 00:56:15.571]  Kevin, Jim, and others, we'll get to you later if you want to hold or not.
[00:56:15.591 --> 00:56:17.211]  You can leave because we're getting into some other subjects.
[00:56:18.052 --> 00:56:20.453]  But Richard Gage, I want to have you back up again in the near future.
[00:56:20.893 --> 00:56:23.974]  We commend you for your tireless work for the truth and for liberty.
[00:56:23.994 --> 00:56:29.936]  9-11 has been used to destroy our Bill of Rights and Constitution and launch us on a path towards criminal world government.
[00:56:30.496 --> 00:56:39.461]  Not only by exposing this great new mythos they've created, this new religion of tyranny, can liberty then grow again in our fine land and worldwide.
[00:56:39.541 --> 00:56:42.043]  So, I commend you, my friend, and we salute you.
[00:56:42.063 --> 00:56:42.823]  Vaya con Dios!
[00:56:43.744 --> 00:56:44.384]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:56:44.404 --> 00:56:46.125]  It's an honor to be with you always.
[00:56:46.506 --> 00:56:47.126]  Honor to be with you.
[00:56:47.186 --> 00:56:48.126]  Take care, Richard Gage.
[00:56:48.667 --> 00:56:49.487]  We'll be right back.
[00:56:49.868 --> 00:56:55.451]  Ladies and gentlemen, get into the feudalism being set up as the people are being treated like third world serf slaves.
[00:56:57.526 --> 00:57:00.888]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:57:01.028 --> 00:57:06.251]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:57:06.431 --> 00:57:11.214]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:57:11.594 --> 00:57:22.721]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:57:23.121 --> 00:57:28.667]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:57:28.887 --> 00:57:34.953]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[00:57:35.153 --> 00:57:35.813]  What about you?
[00:57:36.194 --> 00:57:38.116]  Order your KDF shower filter normally.
[00:57:38.196 --> 00:57:42.240]  Forty nine dollars for a special price of only thirty nine ninety nine with free shipping.

[00:58:07.875 --> 00:58:08.396]  Bin Laden.
[00:58:08.676 --> 00:58:09.657]  This is his ammo.
[00:58:09.677 --> 00:58:10.998]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:58:11.038 --> 00:58:12.739]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:58:13.039 --> 00:58:19.785]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:58:20.185 --> 00:58:20.625]  Some U.S.
[00:58:20.665 --> 00:58:26.350]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:58:27.010 --> 00:58:30.493]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:58:30.513 --> 00:58:32.655]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:58:57.592 --> 00:59:09.280]  Now that the election is over and the shock is beginning to wear off, Ready Reserve Foods in an effort to get as many Americans prepared for the promised changes of the new administration and to help you and your family survive the global economic crash.
[00:59:11.198 --> 00:59:12.519]  Pre-Inauguration Special.
[00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:19.806]  Between now and January 20th, 2009, all food units U1 through U7 are being offered at wholesale prices.
[00:59:20.286 --> 00:59:21.848]  That's a 33% savings.
[00:59:22.148 --> 00:59:25.431]  A year's supply of meals starts as low as 73 cents per meal.
[00:59:25.871 --> 00:59:32.618]  Ready Reserve Food offers only the highest quality dehydrated food, packed in double enameled cans in an inert nitrogen atmosphere.
[00:59:43.339 --> 00:59:43.759]  Big Brother.
[00:59:43.799 --> 00:59:44.260]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:05.067 --> 01:00:06.148]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:06.809 --> 01:00:07.629]  You want answers?
[01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:09.290]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:09.310 --> 01:00:13.554]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:14.134 --> 01:00:18.237]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.605 --> 01:00:33.289]  Hey, I got to finish my lunch in that three-minute break, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:35.154 --> 01:00:36.515]  I love live TV in here.
[01:00:36.555 --> 01:00:39.276]  It's great at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:00:40.477 --> 01:00:49.542]  I remember about 15 years ago when the Forest Service, Department of Land Management, local game wardens started setting up SWAT teams.
[01:00:51.503 --> 01:00:56.086]  People out in the back of a boat fishing would have guys run up, a man with a small child that was in
[01:00:57.418 --> 01:01:00.719]  I think the NRA magazine a few years ago pointed machine guns at him.
[01:01:01.979 --> 01:01:06.039]  They're raiding farmers and ranchers claiming they don't have permits for organic eggs.
[01:01:06.079 --> 01:01:10.860]  They're raiding local co-ops that are selling their eggs or milk.
[01:01:12.741 --> 01:01:14.701]  And they're hiring all these bureaucracies.
[01:01:14.741 --> 01:01:16.521]  It's just radically expanding.
[01:01:17.721 --> 01:01:22.622]  And now when you talk to a game warden, because we have a piece of property we've had since 1829 in East Texas, Mexican land grant.
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:29.441]  They're rude.
[01:01:30.342 --> 01:01:31.524]  They'll pull up at the deer camp.
[01:01:31.544 --> 01:01:33.987]  They'll get out and go, I want to see everything you're doing.
[01:01:34.487 --> 01:01:36.570]  I want to make sure the tags are right on this deer.
[01:01:37.431 --> 01:01:39.814]  I mean, it just goes on and on and on.
[01:01:43.787 --> 01:01:53.415]  You know, the landowner, with the tag on the deer, was driving it for my great-uncle to the local processor.
[01:01:53.495 --> 01:01:56.778]  You know, they gutted it, but they wanted to have it turned into sausage, so he was taking it.
[01:01:57.138 --> 01:02:06.346]  State police jumped on him, screamed at him, acted like he was a criminal, said, you're going to jail, and then told him it was illegal for him to be transporting a deer that wasn't his, and he said, I'm the landowner.
[01:02:06.786 --> 01:02:07.407]  I know the law.
[01:02:08.027 --> 01:02:09.489]  And, you know, I'm taking it here.
[01:02:10.549 --> 01:02:15.172]  Didn't matter if my uncle was even known to the state police officer and our family been there forever.
[01:02:15.933 --> 01:02:19.255]  It's about letting us know we're trash and scum and that they own us.
[01:02:20.016 --> 01:02:26.221]  Now, it's not enough that they now run a background check on you when you buy a license all over the country.
[01:02:26.561 --> 01:02:28.482]  Feds pushed it, states passed it, most of them.
[01:02:30.424 --> 01:02:35.928]  So now if you haven't paid your child support or if you've got some background or you can't go buy the
[01:02:37.782 --> 01:02:41.544]  Hunting license and the hunting license is everywhere just exploding in price.
[01:02:43.424 --> 01:02:45.605]  This is all designed to go after law abiding people.
[01:02:45.645 --> 01:02:49.267]  So see they train you how to be a slave, how to be a serf, just like in jolly old England.
[01:02:50.486 --> 01:02:51.726]  Where only the nobles can hunt.
[01:02:52.727 --> 01:02:58.308]  Now they want you, and it's happening all over the country, to register your property, just like the animal ID or the premises ID.
[01:02:58.548 --> 01:03:00.749]  And when you register, you waive all these rights.
[01:03:01.409 --> 01:03:07.491]  And now, not just the game wardens, but the Forest Service and others, so they can come on your land without warrants whenever they want.
[01:03:07.511 --> 01:03:09.832]  I mean, this is criminal.
[01:03:10.732 --> 01:03:12.453]  And these are nothing but parasites.
[01:03:13.373 --> 01:03:16.674]  The deer are jumping out in front of cars, killing people every day across the nation.
[01:03:17.414 --> 01:03:19.595]  Wolves, coyotes are running wild in Austin.
[01:03:20.535 --> 01:03:26.822]  You walk out back my house in Southwest Austin every night and hear the coyotes going wild or eating people's dogs and cats.
[01:03:27.643 --> 01:03:32.449]  They pay trappers thousands of dollars per deer to come trap the white tail, fly them to Mexico.
[01:03:32.729 --> 01:03:34.671]  They're so stressed out by the time they get there they die.
[01:03:35.852 --> 01:03:37.353]  So they're not letting humans be predators.
[01:03:37.373 --> 01:03:39.135]  They're not letting anything else happen.
[01:03:39.235 --> 01:03:40.356]  Everything is falling apart.
[01:03:41.056 --> 01:03:46.360]  And I'm aware of a case, similarly, where they're trying to pass things like this in Missouri.
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:49.782]  And people are fighting back there in Missouri against this.
[01:03:49.842 --> 01:03:53.965]  And Russell Wood, the President of the Property Rights Congress, and
[01:03:55.706 --> 01:04:00.128]  Again, you have to register your farm, you have to register your ranch, it can be 10 acres.
[01:04:00.448 --> 01:04:07.951]  If you want to put a deer blind out back for your grandson, you go register with them and you waive all your rights and they say it's a privilege.
[01:04:08.971 --> 01:04:11.112]  And then of course they can start fining, feeing, and taxing.
[01:04:12.133 --> 01:04:19.996]  So I briefly wanted to have him on for about 15-20 minutes to talk about that, because even if you don't hunt, you've been conditioned to hate hunting, just like they did in England.
[01:04:20.376 --> 01:04:26.639]  Now they've banned hunting, they're back to feudalism, but the king, the queen, the royals can still hunt, they've banned most forms of hunting.
[01:04:27.479 --> 01:04:31.140]  You can go buy a steak at the store and that's okay, but don't shoot it yourself, it's supposedly cruel.
[01:04:31.941 --> 01:04:35.342]  Again, they want to dehumanize us, they want to kill our rural culture.
[01:04:35.762 --> 01:04:37.123]  They want us totally under their control.
[01:04:38.203 --> 01:04:47.648]  In the 20s and 30s when we had the depression, 90% of people were agrarian, on the land, self-sufficient, and 7 million starved to death, according to a major university study that was out a few months ago.
[01:04:48.088 --> 01:04:56.072]  Now, 90 plus percent of us live in the cities, and of the 10% that live in the country, only half of those, or 5% of the country, are what you'd call self-sufficient.
[01:04:56.792 --> 01:04:57.813]  And they want to shut that down.
[01:04:59.410 --> 01:05:01.831]  And again, words can't describe all the things that are happening.
[01:05:01.871 --> 01:05:02.651]  The harassment.
[01:05:03.351 --> 01:05:06.731]  You try to go to a national park or state park now, the rangers are rude to you.
[01:05:06.952 --> 01:05:08.052]  The humans are bad.
[01:05:08.372 --> 01:05:09.112]  We're bad.
[01:05:09.172 --> 01:05:10.372]  We're not supposed to be out there.
[01:05:10.392 --> 01:05:11.352]  We're evil serfs.
[01:05:11.772 --> 01:05:13.953]  This is a mode of control of the population.
[01:05:14.373 --> 01:05:17.794]  But the good news is, in Missouri, they're beating these initiatives.
[01:05:18.274 --> 01:05:20.694]  In Texas, we're gilded and it's very sad.
[01:05:21.674 --> 01:05:24.095]  Our people have become very cowardly and slave-like.
[01:05:25.876 --> 01:05:30.300]  There's no law you have to have the animal ID federally, but all these states have adopted it.
[01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:31.040]  Many have.
[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:31.941]  Texas adopted it.
[01:05:32.822 --> 01:05:35.384]  And there's no law, but they still come and harass you.
[01:05:35.404 --> 01:05:38.046]  And when you sign it, then you waive your rights to your property.
[01:05:38.086 --> 01:05:41.108]  Thousand, two thousand dollar a day fines if a cow dies and you don't report it.
[01:05:42.209 --> 01:05:46.814]  You have to put chips in all your animals, but the big agribusiness doesn't, so it's bankrupt.
[01:05:47.114 --> 01:05:52.318]  The small farms and ranches, they're now SWAT teaming again, organic farmers, that's coming up in 20 minutes.
[01:05:52.859 --> 01:05:53.820]  So this is very, very serious.
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:56.783]  I wanted to preface that before we bring Russell Wood up.
[01:05:57.163 --> 01:05:58.904]  Russell, good to have you here, sir.
[01:05:59.705 --> 01:06:02.428]  Tell us exactly what you're facing there in Missouri.
[01:06:03.288 --> 01:06:08.313]  The Conservation Department is trying to get some new regulations in place
[01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:15.111]  And the way the latest department is set up here, they're free of the legislature.
[01:06:16.492 --> 01:06:24.774]  Our lawmakers really have almost no control, well virtually no control, over their rules, regulations and or their spending.
[01:06:26.454 --> 01:06:35.476]  They've been giving a never-ending one-eighth cent sales tax with no control from any elected officials.
[01:06:36.197 --> 01:06:37.357]  It's theirs to spend.
[01:06:38.291 --> 01:07:04.100]  So they are pretty much free to do as they please, and right now they're proposing a new set of hunting regulations on deer and turkey, where they say, for one thing, that you must own at least 80 acres to qualify for a no-cost landowner deer permit, deer tag, or turkey tag.
[01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:12.714]  This is something that we're just simply not going to, we're just not going to stand for.
[01:07:12.734 --> 01:07:23.522]  They're also saying that we must register our property if we want this, if we want to hunt on our own property.
[01:07:24.523 --> 01:07:32.809]  The way they say it, they say landowner, hunters wanting to receive landowner deer and turkey permit privileges.
[01:07:34.192 --> 01:07:36.734]  They're going to extend us a privilege.
[01:07:37.795 --> 01:07:43.699]  We must first register our property with the landowner registry.
[01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:55.968]  And on this registering, they want, now this is off of their literature, they want property location, section, township, range.
[01:07:57.349 --> 01:08:00.591]  They want number of acres at that location.
[01:08:02.096 --> 01:08:08.380]  They want the status of each person there, whether it's immediate, household, whatever.
[01:08:11.182 --> 01:08:20.568]  Then they will be able to have their point of sale system so that when you walk in there, they have verification that you actually own land.
[01:08:20.948 --> 01:08:24.791]  They say that people have cheated on this before.
[01:08:26.464 --> 01:08:32.706]  Oh yeah, it's always how we all have to be treated like criminals, guilty until proven innocent, to stop a few, quote, cheats.
[01:08:33.607 --> 01:08:42.169]  I mean, you heard me do that whole rant earlier, sir, about the way they're treating people, the way they're acting, all these new bureaucrats, they're just, I mean, they need to get off our back.
[01:08:42.510 --> 01:08:47.751]  And just what you just read, they're saying it's a privilege to hunt on your own land, because it's our land.
[01:08:47.771 --> 01:08:49.232]  You pay property taxes on it,
[01:08:50.032 --> 01:08:54.235]  And then we come in there and then we give you permission to hunt on your own land.
[01:08:54.675 --> 01:08:57.917]  If you want to receive permit privileges.
[01:08:58.538 --> 01:08:58.838]  Yeah.
[01:08:59.078 --> 01:08:59.318]  Yeah.
[01:09:00.039 --> 01:09:14.289]  But they closed this little part by saying requiring persons to declare their specific land ownership up front will make it, now get this, easier for department personnel to verify land ownership.
[01:09:14.829 --> 01:09:19.192]  They don't say anything about this is a good deal for managing livestock.
[01:09:19.881 --> 01:09:24.644]  How about you go to the state and get half these people fired in this economy?
[01:09:26.985 --> 01:09:29.646]  There's no commercial poaching going on that I know of anymore.
[01:09:29.686 --> 01:09:31.047]  All they do is harass people.
[01:09:31.587 --> 01:09:35.509]  They can go arrest good old boys shooting deer off the highway on other people's property all day.
[01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:38.311]  That's fine and dandy, but no, they're there to harass.
[01:09:38.331 --> 01:09:38.871]  You can tell.
[01:09:38.951 --> 01:09:40.172]  They hate landowners.
[01:09:40.432 --> 01:09:41.473]  They hate America.
[01:09:41.613 --> 01:09:44.534]  They're a bunch of communist filth, and I'm calling them out.
[01:09:44.875 --> 01:09:47.516]  Get out of our country, you dirtbag trash.
[01:09:47.736 --> 01:09:48.737]  We're not in 1200 England.
[01:09:50.413 --> 01:09:50.693]  Thank you.
[01:10:12.638 --> 01:10:16.999]  Oh, just 2,300 parasitic environmental wackos.
[01:10:17.059 --> 01:10:19.400]  Again, they don't care about real environmental problems.
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:20.101]  I've run into them.
[01:10:20.141 --> 01:10:24.863]  These are hate-filled, sandal-wearing, long-haired communists.
[01:10:24.883 --> 01:10:27.124]  I'm not saying they're bad if they wear sandals and have long hair, but that type.
[01:10:27.404 --> 01:10:31.305]  And they go get a gun and a uniform, and literally, folks, I've run into them.
[01:10:31.525 --> 01:10:32.706]  They are scum.
[01:10:32.746 --> 01:10:33.126]  Go ahead.
[01:10:33.726 --> 01:10:39.909]  Well, so many of these, you know, the old conservation game wardens we used to have around here.
[01:10:40.595 --> 01:10:45.618]  Actually, we're interested in the wildlife and in managing wildlife and that sort of thing.
[01:10:46.598 --> 01:10:48.560]  Well, I heard Gary Brownfield talking about it himself.
[01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:52.482]  He worked for one of these big, you know, in Missouri.
[01:10:54.163 --> 01:10:59.686]  And he said you couldn't have paid them in the 60s when he was there to go out and do stuff like this and harass people.
[01:11:00.262 --> 01:11:05.625]  Many of these new ones are, they're the younger folks that have never been off asphalt in their life.
[01:11:05.645 --> 01:11:10.968]  Yeah, they come out of the big cities, they hate America, they hate hunting, and they're here to harass landowners.
[01:11:10.988 --> 01:11:13.369]  They need to get their ass off our property.
[01:11:14.350 --> 01:11:22.414]  But our response to this is that we will buy no deer or turkey tags, period.
[01:11:23.755 --> 01:11:28.057]  And there will also be no hunting on our property, on our private property,
[01:11:29.031 --> 01:11:33.335]  By anyone who has a deer or turkey tactic.
[01:11:33.375 --> 01:11:36.058]  And you guys have successfully used that tactic before.
[01:11:36.418 --> 01:11:39.701]  If all these greedy creatures care about some money, you'll just boycott them.
[01:11:41.202 --> 01:11:43.064]  We're just not going to buy their tags.
[01:11:43.905 --> 01:11:49.991]  We're going to post our land so that no one can out there accept ourselves.
[01:11:50.011 --> 01:11:50.851]  Alright, stay there sir.
[01:11:50.871 --> 01:11:54.014]  We're going to come back and talk more about what you're doing on the other side.
[01:11:54.034 --> 01:11:54.455]  Stay with us.
[01:11:57.230 --> 01:12:00.851]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[01:12:00.931 --> 01:12:06.553]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[01:12:06.673 --> 01:12:10.714]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[01:12:11.014 --> 01:12:13.295]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[01:12:13.475 --> 01:12:19.377]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures.
[01:12:19.377 --> 01:12:20.078]  We're good to go!
[01:12:50.382 --> 01:12:54.264]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[01:12:54.284 --> 01:13:01.728]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:13:01.748 --> 01:13:03.870]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:13:04.010 --> 01:13:05.551]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:13:05.611 --> 01:13:07.212]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:13:07.292 --> 01:13:10.093]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:13:10.113 --> 01:13:13.795]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:13:23.474 --> 01:13:28.760]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:13:29.601 --> 01:13:30.722]  An inside job.
[01:13:32.114 --> 01:13:33.154]  How dare you?
[01:13:34.555 --> 01:13:39.617]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:13:39.637 --> 01:13:42.058]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:13:42.098 --> 01:13:48.700]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:51.561]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[01:13:51.841 --> 01:13:53.822]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:13:54.102 --> 01:13:56.563]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:13:57.043 --> 01:14:03.270]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:14:03.730 --> 01:14:11.499]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:14:11.839 --> 01:14:17.425]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt?
[01:14:17.754 --> 01:14:19.695]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[01:14:19.996 --> 01:14:24.759]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:14:25.099 --> 01:14:29.803]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:14:30.303 --> 01:14:34.166]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:14:34.666 --> 01:14:35.667]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:14:35.747 --> 01:14:39.830]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:14:40.250 --> 01:14:41.631]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:14:45.143 --> 01:14:47.711]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:14:48.132 --> 01:14:49.797]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:14:52.967 --> 01:14:53.788]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:14:56.289 --> 01:15:01.932]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[01:15:02.112 --> 01:15:07.275]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[01:15:07.556 --> 01:15:12.619]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[01:15:12.919 --> 01:15:16.481]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar.
[01:15:16.701 --> 01:15:17.041]  I'm good.
[01:15:33.653 --> 01:15:34.414]  Do your part.
[01:15:34.694 --> 01:15:36.955]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[01:15:37.316 --> 01:15:46.162]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.
[01:15:46.522 --> 01:15:52.706]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to alkavision.com.
[01:15:52.987 --> 01:15:54.387]  Again, that's alkavision.com.
[01:15:59.116 --> 01:16:04.983]  In the morning you go running For the man who stole your water
[01:16:18.038 --> 01:16:25.800]  Russell Wood, I want to have you back on for a full hour to go over this more in the future, but in the short segment we have, more about your fight against these people.
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:28.260]  I mean, look, it's time for us to stop being so nice, too.
[01:16:28.701 --> 01:16:43.044]  When you see these DNR people or these game wardens that are out of control, I'd walk right up to them in the local cafe and say, I'm tired of you enslaving this country and sucking off of us, and it's time for us to start shunning them and being aggressive like our founding fathers did, not just saying, well, we won't hunt this year.
[01:16:43.444 --> 01:16:46.825]  I know people have done that in other states, and I remember a few years ago in Missouri,
[01:16:47.225 --> 01:16:50.668]  Wasn't there something similar along these lines that made them back off?
[01:16:53.691 --> 01:16:55.533]  No, I don't think so.
[01:16:55.573 --> 01:16:56.254]  I don't remember it.
[01:16:56.374 --> 01:16:57.275]  I've seen some other cases.
[01:16:57.295 --> 01:16:58.396]  Well, I'll tell you what makes me mad.
[01:16:58.736 --> 01:17:04.542]  I read the stories about states where they don't pass the animal ID or premises ID to waive all your rights and go under their control.
[01:17:05.062 --> 01:17:11.108]  And then they'll tell, okay, the 4-H club, you've all got to sign your parents' property over to us so you can't show your cows or pigs.
[01:17:12.449 --> 01:17:14.090]  Oh yeah, I'm deeply immersed in this animal ID thing.
[01:17:14.110 --> 01:17:14.910]  And it comes from all angles.
[01:17:15.011 --> 01:17:16.932]  It comes from every side, doesn't it?
[01:17:38.456 --> 01:17:39.477]  Well, that's why I'm angry.
[01:17:39.537 --> 01:17:41.158]  I mean, it's feudalism.
[01:17:41.198 --> 01:17:42.219]  It's total serfdom.
[01:17:42.739 --> 01:17:42.939]  Yeah.
[01:17:44.981 --> 01:17:47.743]  Well, in the minutes we've got left, how do folks contact you?
[01:17:47.763 --> 01:17:48.624]  How do they get involved?
[01:17:48.644 --> 01:17:49.985]  We're on a few stations up in Missouri.
[01:17:50.525 --> 01:17:51.526]  How do people support you?
[01:17:52.246 --> 01:18:01.353]  Well, if they'll just, I'll give them my phone number and they can just call and we'll be getting word out as we progress.
[01:18:01.393 --> 01:18:05.056]  We hope to be getting some no trespassing or no hunting signs fixed.
[01:18:06.197 --> 01:18:07.558]  All with the same wording on
[01:18:08.522 --> 01:18:09.503]  Well, it's hard to say.
[01:18:09.523 --> 01:18:10.523]  We're not a real close-knit group.
[01:18:10.543 --> 01:18:13.926]  We have well over a thousand property owners involved.
[01:18:32.509 --> 01:18:36.731]  We get more than that when we start having rallies and gatherings, you know.
[01:18:36.871 --> 01:18:37.491]  That's right.
[01:18:37.531 --> 01:18:41.073]  You guys have had some big victories in Missouri against these criminals.
[01:18:41.573 --> 01:18:42.194]  Yes, we have.
[01:18:42.314 --> 01:18:42.874]  Yes, we have.
[01:18:43.454 --> 01:18:44.635]  Tell folks about those briefly.
[01:18:46.096 --> 01:18:46.416]  Okay.
[01:18:48.797 --> 01:19:01.163]  The one major one that we had had to do with the watershed district that had been put into effect legally, a freestanding
[01:19:02.159 --> 01:19:07.620]  entity with the rule-making rights and privileges established by the state.
[01:19:09.101 --> 01:19:29.985]  We didn't know about this until it was already in effect, and we went to work with legislators and pointing out what they had really done, and as happens too often, it had been fast without those voting for it really realizing what it said and what it did.
[01:19:31.141 --> 01:19:35.623]  And we were able to get that reversed.
[01:19:37.124 --> 01:19:45.048]  Nine counties were brought into this one big district, and some of the county commissioners didn't even know it was going on, hadn't even been contacted.
[01:19:46.289 --> 01:20:00.096]  As I say, we did get that reversed to prevent establishing a freestanding unit with the ability to make laws governing that district.
[01:20:00.791 --> 01:20:03.272]  And then they were to let people know what the rules were.
[01:20:03.832 --> 01:20:05.072]  This is a coming thing.
[01:20:05.232 --> 01:20:18.595]  This is an offshoot or actually an integral part of the Agenda 21 concepts of doing away with county boundaries.
[01:20:18.655 --> 01:20:26.917]  And here in Missouri right now, they're trying to blur the line between Missouri and Arkansas on watershed issues.
[01:20:30.962 --> 01:20:51.018]  We're so involved with the National Animal Identification System, and the efforts, combined efforts, not just us but others, we've been able to get a law passed here in Missouri to prevent mandatory premise registration for the National Animal Identification System.
[01:20:51.038 --> 01:21:00.065]  That's right, because there's not a law, but by color of law they try to fool and terrorize people into thinking there's a law, so you have to pass a law saying this is a fraud, there isn't a law.
[01:21:00.765 --> 01:21:20.455]  Yeah, and now the USDA has issued directives to the veterinarians and so forth to go ahead, now this is their wording, they say go ahead and assign a premise number to those who do not want one and put a little asterisk by it saying it was not
[01:21:22.295 --> 01:21:30.458]  And that's indentured servitude, making the professionals go out and enforce things that aren't even laws.
[01:21:30.798 --> 01:21:35.379]  Let's do a minute or two on the other side if you can, because I want to give out your phone number so folks can contact you.
[01:21:35.739 --> 01:21:45.142]  Russell's also a former school teacher, owner of Cable Enterprises, former owner of radio stations and movie theaters, and he's out there fighting Big Brother.
[01:21:47.422 --> 01:21:48.322]  We're on the march.
[01:21:48.803 --> 01:21:50.303]  The empire's on the run.
[01:21:51.335 --> 01:21:54.136]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:58.117 --> 01:21:59.318]  Hello, I'm Steve Shank.
[01:21:59.898 --> 01:22:06.080]  For the past several months, folks have constantly asked me to give them the date as to when they should be finished stocking up on food.
[01:22:06.861 --> 01:22:17.004]  We've been so beaten up by stock market banking, housing and unemployment crashes that we're desensitized and frozen inactive like the frog being unknowingly cooked in gradually increasingly hot water.
[01:22:17.484 --> 01:22:18.385]  We'll snap out of it.
[01:22:18.425 --> 01:22:19.405]  We now have a deadline.
[01:22:19.915 --> 01:22:21.396]  Joe Biden said it's going to happen.
[01:22:21.956 --> 01:22:33.284]  Former Secretary of State Colin Powell went on CBS Meet the Press and pointed to about January 22nd as the time a major international incident would force the new president to make unpopular decisions.
[01:22:33.845 --> 01:22:39.548]  Well, I take the general of this word and my best advice is to have your food in your possession prior to the inauguration.
[01:22:39.989 --> 01:22:44.872]  Contact efoodsdirect.com for your supplies prior to this deadline for disaster.
[01:22:45.432 --> 01:22:49.175]  Ask yourself, is it better to have too much too soon or too little too late?
[01:22:49.758 --> 01:22:50.959]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web eFoodsDirect.com
[01:22:57.318 --> 01:22:58.478]  Hi, this is Steve Schenck.
[01:22:58.839 --> 01:23:01.060]  The spirit of America is independence.
[01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:03.761]  The greatest gift of independence is food.
[01:23:04.061 --> 01:23:08.623]  Over one-third of Americans can't afford to buy food and pay their other expenses.
[01:23:08.963 --> 01:23:12.104]  Lines of credit and cards are often cut back or canceled.
[01:23:12.344 --> 01:23:18.447]  Last year, the eFoodsDirect Holiday Food Unit was a fun and exciting one-year supply with a great price.
[01:23:18.867 --> 01:23:25.990]  This year, to quickly complete our food supply preparations, eFoodsDirect has created a very serious holiday unit.
[01:23:26.290 --> 01:23:27.010]  This superfood
[01:23:27.090 --> 01:23:27.610]  We're good to go.
[01:23:57.020 --> 01:24:03.383]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:24:03.763 --> 01:24:05.744]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:24:06.404 --> 01:24:07.424]  But who is the enemy?
[01:24:07.944 --> 01:24:08.485]  Bin Laden.
[01:24:08.745 --> 01:24:09.685]  This is his ammo.
[01:24:09.705 --> 01:24:11.086]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:24:11.106 --> 01:24:12.806]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:24:13.107 --> 01:24:19.869]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:24:20.269 --> 01:24:20.690]  Some U.S.
[01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:26.392]  investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:24:27.092 --> 01:24:30.553]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:24:30.573 --> 01:24:40.837]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:24:41.057 --> 01:24:41.818]  Fabled enemies.
[01:24:42.278 --> 01:24:49.560]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:24:50.041 --> 01:24:53.402]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[01:25:15.951 --> 01:25:21.513]  We've only got about 26 and a half minutes left in the broadcast today.
[01:25:21.533 --> 01:25:31.256]  I could talk for hours with Russell Wood, former president of the Ozark chapter,
[01:25:44.522 --> 01:25:50.167]  of a group that is fighting against the NIS, the Animal ID, the Prima Society, all of it.
[01:25:50.227 --> 01:25:55.671]  Russell Wood, go ahead and fire out the phone number for Missourians out there that are listening and people around the country.
[01:25:56.011 --> 01:26:07.681]  Similar things are happening everywhere that are fighting against this feudalism, forcing people without a law to have Animal ID, microchips in their animals, Prima Society, making you register your property to be able to hunt on your own property.
[01:26:07.701 --> 01:26:08.801]  Then we're going to go to our next guest,
[01:26:09.642 --> 01:26:20.686]  And the director, Maurice Thompson, of the Buckeye Institute for Constitutional Law, and that deals with this amazing case that WorldNetDaily and others have been covering.
[01:26:20.806 --> 01:26:22.326]  Well, WorldNetDaily finally got on it yesterday.
[01:26:22.346 --> 01:26:23.307]  We've been covering it for two weeks.
[01:26:23.327 --> 01:26:32.450]  We're going to have armed officers raid home, hold mom kids for six hours, overselling organic eggs and things like that.
[01:26:34.088 --> 01:26:37.429]  SWAT team holding them at gunpoint for more than six hours.
[01:26:37.449 --> 01:26:43.751]  We'll talk about that with a constitutional law expert who is filing a case against this particular state that's done this.
[01:26:45.031 --> 01:26:46.872]  And there's just too many of these cases to even cover them all.
[01:26:46.892 --> 01:26:48.392]  We're just covering a few of them today.
[01:26:48.432 --> 01:26:51.593]  People being arrested or fined or feed for giving their neighbors milk.
[01:26:51.693 --> 01:26:53.574]  I mean, it's total control.
[01:26:53.614 --> 01:26:55.454]  This whole thing is pointed at the American people.
[01:26:56.034 --> 01:27:01.356]  But Russell Wood, give out your number for folks that want to be able to help you fight back against what's happening.
[01:27:02.096 --> 01:27:09.981]  My number is area code 417-948-2379.
[01:27:10.841 --> 01:27:28.171]  And we're getting some no hunting posters made up that we hope to get distributed throughout the state to let them see that these are areas that are going to be taken out of use, you know, for those who buy their tags from the state.
[01:27:28.942 --> 01:27:30.503]  Let him go hunt on state property.
[01:27:47.441 --> 01:27:49.344]  Two, three, seven, nine.
[01:28:03.183 --> 01:28:03.524]  I think?
[01:28:21.807 --> 01:28:28.470]  There's so many reasons to have storable food, firearms, and to be self-sufficient, so please go to efoodsdirect.com.
[01:28:28.490 --> 01:28:30.991]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:28:31.011 --> 01:28:32.111]  It lasts more than 10 years.
[01:28:32.171 --> 01:28:33.832]  It's high quality, no MSG.
[01:28:34.392 --> 01:28:36.393]  Their toll-free number to call them is 800-409-5633, 800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com.
[01:28:36.433 --> 01:28:37.633]  Then there's also another great sponsor.
[01:28:48.598 --> 01:28:48.858]  Thank you.
[01:29:05.782 --> 01:29:13.187]  And then puts it through five different, well really seven filters, because one filter has three elements, but five separate filtration systems.
[01:29:13.647 --> 01:29:17.049]  And it's the purest, cleanest drinking water you can find anywhere.
[01:29:17.109 --> 01:29:18.450]  I have one in the office, one at home.
[01:29:18.870 --> 01:29:19.751]  I absolutely love them.
[01:29:19.771 --> 01:29:21.552]  A coloblue.com, ecoloblue.com or 866-585-4044, 866-585-4044.
[01:29:21.572 --> 01:29:25.575]  And all over the nation, on this feudalism issue, of the people being enslaved with classical tyranny,
[01:29:33.780 --> 01:29:41.047]  They're trying to tell folks they've got to register their wells, or put meters on their wells, or tax them for their wells, even water wells for their homes.
[01:29:41.327 --> 01:29:43.289]  In some cases, hundred-year-old wells.
[01:29:43.309 --> 01:29:46.171]  Well, they're not going to be able to stop you getting water out of the air.
[01:29:46.191 --> 01:29:50.355]  Of course, I don't want to give them any ideas.
[01:29:50.475 --> 01:29:52.757]  acolablue.com or 866-585-4044.
[01:29:52.797 --> 01:29:54.358]  We have to become self-sufficient.
[01:29:54.719 --> 01:29:57.761]  The establishment certainly doesn't want that to happen.
[01:29:58.582 --> 01:30:09.395]  Okay, we are joined next by Mortise Thompson, Director of the 1851 Center for Constitutional Law, working with the Buckeye Institute on the case of the Manistore House.
[01:30:09.435 --> 01:30:11.858]  A few years ago, this farming family, organic farmers,
[01:30:13.148 --> 01:30:13.288]  Yes.
[01:30:37.875 --> 01:30:40.156]  We're going to have thousands dead on the Texas border from the drug war.
[01:30:40.176 --> 01:30:42.477]  We're going to have all sorts of corruption everywhere.
[01:30:42.517 --> 01:30:44.298]  Trillions being stolen by brokerage firms.
[01:30:44.638 --> 01:30:50.321]  Just out and out criminality, but the system is all focused on squeezing the cattle, milking the American people.
[01:30:50.882 --> 01:30:53.203]  So, Maurice Thompson, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:30:53.803 --> 01:30:54.623]  No problem, Alex.
[01:30:54.663 --> 01:30:55.144]  How do you do?
[01:30:55.364 --> 01:30:55.724]  Good, sir.
[01:30:56.184 --> 01:30:58.505]  Break down the facts of what happened in this case.
[01:30:58.946 --> 01:31:01.347]  Tell us about why you've joined the case and where this is going.
[01:31:02.299 --> 01:31:02.759]  Certainly.
[01:31:02.779 --> 01:31:07.521]  Well, let me talk about that latter part first, and then I'll come back and circle around to the facts.
[01:31:07.561 --> 01:31:15.944]  First of all, your segue into this couldn't have been any better, even your advertisements, because that's what this is really about, is the most basic and fundamental of human rights.
[01:31:16.084 --> 01:31:22.087]  And it's a battle over what behavior we can engage in without a government permission slip.
[01:31:22.567 --> 01:31:28.509]  And this simple behavior is the behavior that our grandparents engaged in, and Americans for generations have.
[01:31:28.882 --> 01:31:32.164]  You know, which is riding down the road and picking up some food from the local farmer.
[01:31:33.665 --> 01:31:45.152]  The Buckeye Institute is an organization in Ohio dedicated to limited government, dedicated to free markets, and generally the right to be left alone by the government, so long as you're not hurting anybody else.
[01:31:45.952 --> 01:31:50.915]  And the reason we picked up on this case is because it implicates a couple really important concerns.
[01:31:51.516 --> 01:31:57.059]  One that I've already mentioned, which is what activity, what basic activity, really deserves to be licensed
[01:31:57.657 --> 01:32:00.058]  And can be licensed under the Constitution.
[01:32:00.618 --> 01:32:09.002]  And the second is, when is it constitutionally permissible for officers to use this kind of force in raiding somebody's personal home?
[01:32:10.382 --> 01:32:17.885]  Now, if I can circle back around and talk about the facts of this case, the Stowers family is a family that lives in a very rural Amish part of Ohio.
[01:32:17.965 --> 01:32:21.107]  They themselves aren't Amish, but they're very religious.
[01:32:21.647 --> 01:32:23.968]  They have a great number of children in the house.
[01:32:23.988 --> 01:32:25.208]  They have eight of their own children.
[01:32:25.388 --> 01:32:26.709]  Six are young and still live there.
[01:32:27.242 --> 01:32:32.463]  And four grandchildren that are staying in the home while the second oldest son is over serving in Iraq.
[01:32:32.523 --> 01:32:33.784]  His wife is staying with them.
[01:32:34.644 --> 01:32:36.924]  They're related to homeschool their children.
[01:32:37.344 --> 01:32:40.165]  They are classically independent, off-the-grid people.
[01:32:40.185 --> 01:32:43.066]  They don't rely on the government for their food or for their education.
[01:32:43.646 --> 01:32:55.989]  They've run this co-op, this family-run food co-op, for six to seven years, and they have their own 20-some acre small farm where they have sheep that they butcher for meat, and goats, and they can get milk from them as well.
[01:32:56.850 --> 01:33:06.299]  And they've also got connections to Amish farmers who have grass-fed cattle and pastured chickens and pesticide-free produce.
[01:33:06.883 --> 01:33:09.805]  And they procure all these things through their co-ops.
[01:33:09.885 --> 01:33:11.667]  And Joseph Stalin wouldn't have liked this.
[01:33:12.367 --> 01:33:13.508]  Hitler wouldn't have liked this.
[01:33:13.988 --> 01:33:19.012]  For those that don't know, authoritarian states always shackle and control small farms.
[01:33:19.373 --> 01:33:21.254]  They hate people being independent.
[01:33:21.534 --> 01:33:26.218]  This is 180 degrees the opposite of what this republic is supposed to be.
[01:33:26.278 --> 01:33:27.719]  This is outrageous.
[01:33:28.059 --> 01:33:28.920]  That's exactly right.
[01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:32.583]  You know, Thomas Jefferson envisioned a nation of small farmers.
[01:33:34.326 --> 01:33:35.086]  Right, exactly.
[01:33:35.246 --> 01:33:39.168]  And now what we have is small farmers being squeezed by these regulations.
[01:33:39.369 --> 01:33:41.570]  And, you know, it's one of two things.
[01:33:41.630 --> 01:33:51.616]  It really is either a government interest in really tightly controlling the food supply, or it's just government as a big dumb animal that backs its way into unsafe situations.
[01:33:51.636 --> 01:33:56.419]  Well, to interrupt, I have a lot of their own documents where they say they've got to break down the family, break down the farm.
[01:33:56.899 --> 01:33:59.981]  The family's a disease, and they know people are exiting the cities
[01:34:00.521 --> 01:34:03.843]  They're kind of going into Amish light by the hundreds of thousands a year.
[01:34:04.203 --> 01:34:06.445]  They see that trend going into the millions a year.
[01:34:07.005 --> 01:34:16.791]  I'm considering evacuating to the countryside, and I live right here in Austin, Texas, just because the cities are so degenerate, the culture is so evil, the crime is exploding, and they don't like it.
[01:34:17.131 --> 01:34:20.894]  The system does not want people going back to the land.
[01:34:20.994 --> 01:34:24.836]  Well, but it's not, you know, it's not just nefarious government officials.
[01:34:25.416 --> 01:34:29.439]  It's government officials who are persuaded by special interest groups
[01:34:30.026 --> 01:34:35.470]  And government really should not be the pliable tool of special interest groups, but all too often it is.
[01:34:35.610 --> 01:34:42.154]  If you look at the regulations they're charged with violating, they're charged with being a retail food establishment without a license.
[01:34:42.294 --> 01:34:45.977]  First of all, they're not even a retail food establishment.
[01:34:45.997 --> 01:34:50.239]  They're basically a members-only, private membership organization, buying club.
[01:34:51.140 --> 01:34:56.864]  It's as though, you know, if you and I wanted to buy the right kind of beef from an Amish farmer, we have to buy the whole cow.
[01:34:57.512 --> 01:34:59.313]  Hey, this is free association!
[01:34:59.754 --> 01:35:10.861]  If I want to go buy a duck, or a chicken, or a cow, or a pig, or their eggs, or if I want to get together with ten families to pool money to buy organic food, I mean, this is ridiculous!
[01:35:10.921 --> 01:35:11.941]  This is disgusting!
[01:35:12.022 --> 01:35:13.242]  That's exactly right.
[01:35:13.262 --> 01:35:13.903]  Let's get under the radar.
[01:35:13.923 --> 01:35:14.603]  I'll quit interrupting.
[01:35:14.863 --> 01:35:15.864]  That's exactly right.
[01:35:16.004 --> 01:35:23.129]  And, you know, the thing I was going to mention is that there are actually 22 exemptions to this retail food establishment law.
[01:35:23.905 --> 01:35:35.588]  But you know, as Nobel economist Milton Friedman pointed out many years ago, the guys that are writing the licensure laws most of the time are the industry people themselves, and they're lobbyists.
[01:35:36.528 --> 01:35:41.409]  Everybody with a lobbyist sits down at the table and writes the law, and guess who gets left out of that process?
[01:35:41.469 --> 01:35:51.532]  The small family farmer, the organic cooper, cooperative runner, who doesn't have a lobbyist down in Columbus or down in Washington,
[01:35:52.133 --> 01:35:53.055]  To exempt them.
[01:35:53.095 --> 01:36:02.497]  So you've got a number of people, you know, the government will argue this is a public safety issue, but the truth is there are a whole slew of people who run more dangerous food operations.
[01:36:03.361 --> 01:36:09.585]  If dangerous at all, then the Stowers family... Well look, they've shut down most of the family farms with regulations.
[01:36:09.625 --> 01:36:16.989]  We know Animal ID and Premises ID was openly written by big agribusiness to put expenses on small farms and ranches to bankrupt them.
[01:36:17.289 --> 01:36:18.930]  That's what big corporations always do.
[01:36:18.950 --> 01:36:21.731]  Let's get into the raid itself and where you're going with this.
[01:36:22.092 --> 01:36:22.632]  Absolutely.
[01:36:22.792 --> 01:36:26.194]  Well, it's important to know some of the facts leading up to the raid.
[01:36:26.734 --> 01:36:28.915]  The Health Department came out and investigated these people.
[01:36:28.955 --> 01:36:29.676]  We don't know why.
[01:36:30.036 --> 01:36:31.797]  There was never a report filed against them.
[01:36:32.273 --> 01:36:33.633]  None of their members are disgruntled.
[01:36:33.653 --> 01:36:38.995]  They're very, very happy with the products they get from this family because the food's cheap, and it's good for them, and they're happy.
[01:36:39.015 --> 01:36:43.456]  Just how dare Americans be working with their neighbors and selling chicken eggs!
[01:36:43.656 --> 01:36:44.736]  That's Al-Qaeda!
[01:36:44.856 --> 01:36:46.536]  The government's got to run everything!
[01:36:46.896 --> 01:36:47.056]  Right.
[01:36:47.096 --> 01:36:52.318]  God forbid we have freedom to contract among two consenting adults who want to protect their own health interests.
[01:36:52.838 --> 01:36:58.659]  Well, you know, there was never any report filed, but the health department came out
[01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:00.763]  He said they might need a license.
[01:37:00.783 --> 01:37:02.847]  The family responded by writing a letter to the health department.
[01:37:03.408 --> 01:37:05.469]  Asking for clarification on the law, and asking for evidence.
[01:37:05.589 --> 01:37:14.152]  Look, just being able to write probably angered the Health Department, because the general public saw Fluoride and Prozac, and they said, look, we got one that knows how to write.
[01:37:14.393 --> 01:37:17.074]  Send a SWAT team immediately, that's Al-Qaeda for sure!
[01:37:17.434 --> 01:37:26.017]  Well, the Health Department didn't like it, you're right, because whenever individuals defend their rights against the government, the government's never too happy, because these people have some imperial hubris about them.
[01:37:26.117 --> 01:37:26.518]  They do.
[01:37:26.638 --> 01:37:30.059]  And they didn't like, the director of the Health Department didn't like the tone of the letter.
[01:37:30.492 --> 01:37:32.973]  So he brought in a hire because it was inquisitive.
[01:37:33.053 --> 01:37:34.114]  It wasn't nasty at all.
[01:37:34.154 --> 01:37:35.595]  We have a copy of it.
[01:37:35.615 --> 01:37:38.396]  You write me a letter and I send a SWAT team.
[01:37:38.416 --> 01:37:41.538]  You think in America you can write a letter to the government?
[01:37:41.758 --> 01:37:43.999]  I'm sending armed men to show you!
[01:37:44.139 --> 01:37:48.341]  Well, first they sent in an Ohio Department of Agriculture official.
[01:37:48.789 --> 01:37:52.191]  Who basically treated this like a drug investigation.
[01:37:52.231 --> 01:37:55.654]  He went undercover and tried to join the co-op as a member.
[01:37:56.054 --> 01:38:02.459]  Of course they could, you know, they could... Yeah, they're shifting their whole fake war on drugs that they admit was really meant to get spies.
[01:38:02.739 --> 01:38:05.481]  Now they're shifting it on to organic farmers, see?
[01:38:06.141 --> 01:38:06.301]  Right.
[01:38:06.361 --> 01:38:09.544]  War on drug tactics are dangerous and they have been for a long time.
[01:38:09.964 --> 01:38:15.508]  And now we do see some of the issues with that where these same drug war tactics are being used against people
[01:38:16.152 --> 01:38:19.956]  Who everybody now has to acknowledge are not a danger to anyone.
[01:38:19.976 --> 01:38:21.538]  These are peaceful religious people.
[01:38:21.578 --> 01:38:22.079]  Oh no, that's evil.
[01:38:22.279 --> 01:38:23.961]  And these same tactics are being used.
[01:38:24.001 --> 01:38:27.204]  He went undercover, he surveilled them, he attempted to join their co-op.
[01:38:27.224 --> 01:38:28.486]  He's a Stasi spy!
[01:38:28.526 --> 01:38:31.108]  This is like Russia, spying on a little farm.
[01:38:31.188 --> 01:38:31.589]  Go ahead.
[01:38:31.869 --> 01:38:34.552]  Right, and for two hours he tried to arm-twist them into joining the co-op.
[01:38:34.572 --> 01:38:35.173]  They told him no.
[01:38:35.949 --> 01:38:37.511]  Uh, he told them a bunch of lies.
[01:38:37.551 --> 01:38:42.976]  He told them he had a sick mother and these eggs, uh, these unpastured chicken eggs would make her better.
[01:38:43.356 --> 01:38:45.258]  You know, can you please share these with me?
[01:38:45.818 --> 01:38:49.542]  They said they really weren't interested in dealing with him because they're a private membership organization.
[01:38:49.562 --> 01:38:51.764]  Um, he continued to twist their arm.
[01:38:51.784 --> 01:38:52.685]  He wouldn't leave their house.
[01:38:52.845 --> 01:38:55.167]  Eventually they said, here, just take the eggs and get out of here, please.
[01:38:55.969 --> 01:39:00.351]  That's like the Mennonite farmer that said, OK, I'll give you milk.
[01:39:00.431 --> 01:39:02.072]  That's your SWAT team, baby!
[01:39:02.432 --> 01:39:04.433]  And that was an Ohio case, too, I believe.
[01:39:04.533 --> 01:39:08.635]  The same Ohio Department of Agriculture that is engaging in these activities.
[01:39:08.655 --> 01:39:12.557]  They're very much a rogue agency that's very much out of control and needs to be reined in.
[01:39:13.037 --> 01:39:13.938]  You're exactly right.
[01:39:15.438 --> 01:39:23.182]  Nine times out of ten, when I hear the word entrapment, it doesn't interest me because I think it's a little overblown.
[01:39:23.564 --> 01:39:28.826]  But this is a real case of the government manufacturing a crime over eggs to catch a crime.
[01:39:29.086 --> 01:39:29.166]  Eggs?
[01:39:29.186 --> 01:39:29.586]  Exactly.
[01:39:30.626 --> 01:39:34.327]  How many times growing up did we pull over and buy eggs at some little place where they're selling eggs?
[01:39:34.748 --> 01:39:35.268]  Exactly right.
[01:39:35.288 --> 01:39:38.969]  If you can't do that in America, you've got to buy at Walmart, you've got to buy a radiated egg.
[01:39:39.269 --> 01:39:41.130]  How dare you pull over and get a fresh egg?
[01:39:41.210 --> 01:39:42.710]  Oh my God.
[01:39:42.750 --> 01:39:46.511]  There is no more fundamental right, especially when you're talking about basic food.
[01:39:47.952 --> 01:39:49.612]  It really doesn't get any more fundamental.
[01:39:49.632 --> 01:39:51.733]  But these parasites, tell them what the parasites did.
[01:39:52.353 --> 01:40:12.882]  Well, based upon this one alleged sale of eggs, this retail sale, quote-unquote, the OD agent went and procured a search warrant, and then he exaggerated the situation and got the right to search the family's entire personal residence, not just the part where the co-op was.
[01:40:13.503 --> 01:40:18.745]  So, on December 1st in the morning, armed officers surrounded the house,
[01:40:19.361 --> 01:40:21.802]  And then went in with guns drawn.
[01:40:22.503 --> 01:40:26.325]  The lead officer was a violent fugitive task force officer.
[01:40:26.345 --> 01:40:27.846]  That's his specialization.
[01:40:27.866 --> 01:40:29.267]  Well, these are violent people!
[01:40:29.887 --> 01:40:31.008]  That's right.
[01:40:31.068 --> 01:40:33.749]  People that make chickens are Al-Qaeda.
[01:40:34.710 --> 01:40:37.452]  And they're in there with their black helmets and their machine guns.
[01:40:37.872 --> 01:40:39.753]  Oh God, Americans are next!
[01:40:40.233 --> 01:40:40.914]  Oh Lord!
[01:40:41.014 --> 01:40:43.335]  Oh God, what am I going to do?
[01:40:43.835 --> 01:40:45.676]  Well, and you know, the thing is,
[01:40:47.390 --> 01:40:53.657]  The police had no reason to be so forceful or to be scared and wetting themselves with concern over this family.
[01:40:53.797 --> 01:40:56.320]  Except that FEMA teaches them that rural people are terrorists.
[01:40:56.340 --> 01:40:57.441]  Have you seen those training videos?
[01:40:57.922 --> 01:41:04.029]  Well, if you look at the definition of terrorism in the Ohio revised code, and then you compare it to what happened to these people,
[01:41:04.885 --> 01:41:08.066]  You may find that that fits the facts of the crime.
[01:41:09.426 --> 01:41:17.067]  That's right, under the new Federal Patriot Act, any action that's a misdemeanor, basically, in Section 802 of it, but tell folks, aiming guns at the children?
[01:41:17.567 --> 01:41:25.269]  Well, to be fair, Alex, some of the blog facts initially reported were overblown, but that doesn't diminish the significance.
[01:41:25.389 --> 01:41:26.729]  So these armed men, what did they do?
[01:41:26.769 --> 01:41:27.109]  What did they do?
[01:41:27.149 --> 01:41:27.349]  Right.
[01:41:27.629 --> 01:41:31.990]  This was not a SWAT team, but it was police using SWAT-like tactics
[01:41:32.403 --> 01:41:38.208]  They burst through into the house after the door was opened, before they obtained any kind of consent to enter.
[01:41:39.228 --> 01:41:40.189]  They burst through the house.
[01:41:40.570 --> 01:41:43.852]  They locked it down as though it were enemy battle territory.
[01:41:44.653 --> 01:41:58.724]  They ushered the whole family by force into one small room, where numerous agents from health departments and from the Department of Agriculture came in, combed over their entire personal residence, took all of their personal food.
[01:41:58.744 --> 01:42:01.086]  This is a family of ten who had just butchered
[01:42:01.596 --> 01:42:06.378]  A large part of their herd of sheep, and they took all of this meat from this family.
[01:42:06.398 --> 01:42:08.099]  And I'm sure the government targeted it.
[01:42:08.299 --> 01:42:10.340]  I'm sure they targeted them to try to bankrupt them.
[01:42:10.380 --> 01:42:11.581]  That's also a tactic.
[01:42:11.601 --> 01:42:12.861]  That's actually exactly right.
[01:42:12.881 --> 01:42:18.124]  They were trying to set up some sort of controlled buy, and they were waiting for this meat to get back to the family to do this.
[01:42:18.144 --> 01:42:24.007]  And of course, they had to wait so long that they were outside of the scope of the warrant, which had actually expired by the time they did this.
[01:42:25.207 --> 01:42:26.108]  So they're in the house.
[01:42:26.128 --> 01:42:26.868]  They take all this.
[01:42:26.888 --> 01:42:28.869]  They take the personal computers of the family.
[01:42:29.329 --> 01:42:30.790]  They take the personal cell phone.
[01:42:31.708 --> 01:42:37.274]  They take everything from this family, and they still have a lot of these things.
[01:42:37.314 --> 01:42:43.740]  They've just given back some of the computers and cell phones, but they've kept the rest, and they're now looking to press criminal charges.
[01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:44.922]  Alright, stay there.
[01:42:44.962 --> 01:42:47.604]  I'm going to skip this break for the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[01:42:48.025 --> 01:42:50.447]  For everybody else, we'll be back in three minutes with our guest.
[01:42:50.467 --> 01:42:50.888]  Stay with us.
[01:42:57.461 --> 01:43:01.162]  All right, sir, we're going to skip this break and we come back to the full audience.
[01:43:01.783 --> 01:43:02.823]  Some stations aren't with us now.
[01:43:02.843 --> 01:43:05.984]  I want to give out your website for folks to support you and to help you.
[01:43:06.024 --> 01:43:11.446]  And again, you know, I'm trying to illustrate how absurd all this is with all my screwing around, but I'm not screwing around.
[01:43:11.466 --> 01:43:13.067]  I mean, this is for folks that don't know.
[01:43:13.087 --> 01:43:18.268]  Is this not, I mean, as a constitutional lawyer yourself, classical Stalinist tyranny?
[01:43:19.169 --> 01:43:20.349]  Well, here's the real problem.
[01:43:20.689 --> 01:43:22.170]  I think that you're fairly correct.
[01:43:23.391 --> 01:43:30.915]  And you can, you know, the whole argument that this is a public safety issue is undermined by the fact that there are 22 exemptions to the law.
[01:43:31.315 --> 01:43:36.578]  I mean, and these are people that are treated no differently than the Stowers, or they treat their food no differently than the Stowers.
[01:43:37.216 --> 01:43:38.896]  Other than it's unconventional.
[01:43:39.176 --> 01:43:41.017]  Why were the police so jacked up?
[01:43:41.037 --> 01:43:52.659]  I mean, why were they relishing putting so much manpower, not into missing children, not into car thefts, not into home invasions or rapes, but casing and spying and tracking egg sellers?
[01:43:53.199 --> 01:44:00.221]  It's really not clear whether they're trying to enhance their own bureaucratic self-interest, trying to justify their existence.
[01:44:00.971 --> 01:44:25.656]  As a bureaucracy, it's really not clear, but here's the important thing to know about your Fourth Amendment rights, when it relates to search and seizure here, is that, you know, these paramilitary raids are on the rise, and they're on the rise for offenses like this, alleged offenses like this, that at best are licensure law violations, and the police don't have the right to use this kind of force on peaceful people.
[01:44:25.876 --> 01:44:29.357]  The reason that this knock-and-announce rule was put into place
[01:44:29.935 --> 01:44:42.404]  And the only reason they can be violated are when there's either one, worry that the evidence is going to be destroyed, or two, there's worry that the people inside are armed and dangerous and going for their guns.
[01:44:43.264 --> 01:44:48.028]  And there is never any indication that these people were going to destroy the evidence.
[01:44:48.048 --> 01:44:52.311]  But see, now they say if you're a gun owner, though, that's their excuse to go after you.
[01:44:53.271 --> 01:44:53.932]  Well, you know what?
[01:44:54.312 --> 01:44:56.814]  I wouldn't have been surprised to have seen that.
[01:44:57.426 --> 01:45:01.467]  And the affidavit that procured the search warrant, but not even that much was alleged.
[01:45:01.507 --> 01:45:04.288]  There was no allegation in the affidavit that these people were dangerous.
[01:45:04.328 --> 01:45:07.869]  Now, have they given back their food, or are they just letting it all spoil?
[01:45:08.369 --> 01:45:17.052]  Well, right now, they're, uh, I've been told they're storing it in an undisclosed location somewhere, and they say that it's being kept frozen.
[01:45:18.353 --> 01:45:18.793]  We don't know.
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:21.581]  Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.
[01:45:21.662 --> 01:45:26.646]  We've asked for the food back and we've asked for compensation in the event that they won't give the food back.
[01:45:26.686 --> 01:45:27.867]  Well, you're suing them now.
[01:45:28.328 --> 01:45:29.108]  Absolutely.
[01:45:29.208 --> 01:45:41.500]  So when we come back in the final five minutes, I'm going to try to shut up and just let you finish up what really happened inside of there for the six plus hours and now where this case is going and then of course give out the Buckeye Institute website.
[01:45:42.220 --> 01:45:52.408]  The Center for Constitutional Law for our substantive audience so they can... And then I'll have you back sometime in the near future for a full hour to explain to people their basic rights that if we don't fight for, we'll disappear.
[01:45:52.428 --> 01:45:52.848]  Here we go.
[01:46:02.655 --> 01:46:04.877]  If you don't fight for a right, it dies.
[01:46:05.197 --> 01:46:07.198]  We must animate our liberties, our freedoms.
[01:46:09.740 --> 01:46:10.561]  And the tyranny
[01:46:12.384 --> 01:46:15.107]  Unfolding against humanity right now is just off the charts.
[01:46:15.647 --> 01:46:27.419]  You know, in the behind-the-scenes talk on PrisonPlanet.tv with our guest, Maurice Thompson, constitutional law scholar and director over there at the Constitutional Law Center with the Buckeye Institute.
[01:46:32.731 --> 01:46:40.777]  You were talking about paramilitary raids on peaceful people for, you know, tiny things that might be a $50 fine, though they had exemptions.
[01:46:42.578 --> 01:46:46.901]  Finish up with that, and then what happened in the raid, and then where are the lawsuits going, and give folks the website.
[01:46:47.362 --> 01:46:47.882]  Sure, Alex.
[01:46:47.922 --> 01:46:55.067]  I'll reiterate what I told you over the break, and that is that one of the things we're fighting for here are people's Fourth Amendment rights.
[01:46:55.808 --> 01:47:01.672]  And, you know, courts have spoken to this issue over and over again for hundreds of years,
[01:47:02.153 --> 01:47:17.778]  And that is that there is a man's home is his castle, and there's a certain amount of dignity and privacy that people are allowed to be entitled to in the home, and that prohibits these kind of Russian, forced, paramilitary-style raids unless they're absolutely necessary.
[01:47:18.198 --> 01:47:26.461]  And they're necessary either where there's imminent danger that the evidence is going to be destroyed, or where there's imminent danger to the police because people might go for their guns.
[01:47:27.121 --> 01:47:28.682]  Here, there was no allegation of that.
[01:47:28.862 --> 01:47:31.603]  And more and more common, we're seeing these kinds of raids on people
[01:47:32.219 --> 01:47:42.229]  Where there is no worry about evidence and no worry about danger, and we believe that that actually violates people's Fourth Amendment rights because even if you get a search warrant, the search and seizure has to be
[01:47:42.802 --> 01:47:46.385]  Conducted reasonably, and we think that's inherently unreasonable.
[01:47:46.405 --> 01:47:48.967]  So finish up with what happened in the house and where you're going from now.
[01:47:49.488 --> 01:47:49.748]  Sure.
[01:47:49.988 --> 01:48:02.119]  Well, the authorities come in, they seize all the family's personal food supply, and they take a bunch of other food that actually belongs to other members of the co-op who haven't picked it up yet, since it had been delivered perhaps.
[01:48:03.820 --> 01:48:10.326]  They keep the family for six hours in this small part of the house as they do all these things, small children.
[01:48:11.222 --> 01:48:19.124]  Who never, being homeschooled, are used to a peaceful environment, never experienced such a thing, and are still a little bit shook up, not to mention how the parents view it.
[01:48:19.704 --> 01:48:23.545]  Well, they take all these things, and they take off eventually.
[01:48:23.565 --> 01:48:26.886]  They took computers, too, right?
[01:48:27.226 --> 01:48:28.567]  They took the family's personal computer.
[01:48:28.587 --> 01:48:35.749]  They took the computers that the homeschool lessons are on, and they took the computers that the daughter uses to talk to her husband, who's fighting for our country in Iraq.
[01:48:37.329 --> 01:48:40.110]  They took all the family's personal cell phones.
[01:48:40.629 --> 01:48:45.691]  They took way more than they had a justification to take, and this happens pretty commonly.
[01:48:46.071 --> 01:48:49.752]  Again, these are drug war tactics, and this was a drug war style raid.
[01:48:49.812 --> 01:48:51.633]  Well, they're going to turn the loose on everything.
[01:48:51.813 --> 01:48:53.713]  Right, we're seeing the expansion of those tactics.
[01:48:53.793 --> 01:48:56.954]  And you were telling me they won't give the food back now, so who knows what's happened to it.
[01:48:57.194 --> 01:48:57.855]  Where does this go?
[01:48:57.895 --> 01:48:58.755]  You're suing them now.
[01:48:58.795 --> 01:48:59.715]  What are you suing them for?
[01:48:59.735 --> 01:49:00.876]  How do we support you?
[01:49:01.336 --> 01:49:02.656]  Well, here's what's important.
[01:49:02.916 --> 01:49:05.037]  The family is a religious, peaceful family.
[01:49:05.357 --> 01:49:06.538]  They're not out for blood.
[01:49:06.558 --> 01:49:07.698]  They're not even out for money.
[01:49:08.483 --> 01:49:15.024]  Arguably, they have a strong Section 1983 action for money from the officers for violation of their constitutional rights, but they want two things.
[01:49:15.584 --> 01:49:26.406]  We're suing for an injunction declaring that these kinds of paramilitary raids on peaceful people are inherently unconstitutional and have to be stopped.
[01:49:26.546 --> 01:49:29.067]  We're suing for the court to declare that.
[01:49:29.447 --> 01:49:36.328]  We're also suing for a declaration that small family farms and co-ops do not require a government permission slip.
[01:49:36.844 --> 01:49:43.716]  Are in fact exempt from the licensure law or need to be exempt under the licensure law because under equal protection
[01:49:44.352 --> 01:49:48.695]  These kinds of licensures were required for a large Giant Eagle or a Wal-Mart produce.
[01:49:48.735 --> 01:49:49.495]  What are they going to do?
[01:49:49.515 --> 01:49:52.917]  Start raiding guys selling firewood or beef jerky or watermelons?
[01:49:53.437 --> 01:49:54.518]  How about lemonade stands?
[01:49:54.738 --> 01:49:55.759]  I mean it could be anything.
[01:49:55.799 --> 01:49:57.179]  Fire up the website.
[01:49:57.199 --> 01:50:00.641]  I want to have you back up for a full hour after the holidays to track what's happening.
[01:50:00.681 --> 01:50:02.883]  Fire up the Buckeye Institute so folks can support it.
[01:50:03.263 --> 01:50:07.305]  It's www.buckeyeinstitute.org.org.
[01:50:07.725 --> 01:50:09.887]  We do need help with cases like this.
[01:50:09.907 --> 01:50:11.908]  We want to bring more of these cases in the future.
[01:50:12.461 --> 01:50:18.143]  So, any donations are great, and we can also donate to the family of people at your market for that purpose.
[01:50:18.663 --> 01:50:23.065]  We're happy to take on these cases, and we're happy to hear from people who have similar cases.
[01:50:23.085 --> 01:50:25.646]  And there's a video from Stowers, and our legal filings are there, too.
[01:50:26.226 --> 01:50:27.327]  BuckeyeInstitute.org?
[01:50:28.047 --> 01:50:28.387]  Correct.
[01:50:28.787 --> 01:50:29.268]  Thank you, sir.
[01:50:29.288 --> 01:50:30.228]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[01:50:30.268 --> 01:50:30.928]  Have a great weekend.
[01:50:31.128 --> 01:50:32.149]  And all of you, have a great weekend.
[01:50:32.169 --> 01:50:33.949]  We'll see you back live, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:50:33.969 --> 01:50:35.430]  Sunday, and back here live on Monday.
[01:50:35.630 --> 01:50:37.551]  Rebroadcast starts now on InfoWars.com.
[01:50:38.571 --> 01:50:39.812]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:50:42.091 --> 01:50:44.393]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:50:47.355 --> 01:50:50.477]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[01:50:50.577 --> 01:50:53.659]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:50:54.040 --> 01:50:55.701]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:50:56.673 --> 01:50:57.694]  But who is the enemy?
[01:50:58.215 --> 01:50:58.735]  Bin Laden.
[01:50:59.036 --> 01:50:59.996]  This is his MO.
[01:51:00.017 --> 01:51:01.338]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:51:01.378 --> 01:51:03.040]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:51:03.380 --> 01:51:10.147]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:51:10.527 --> 01:51:10.968]  Some U.S.
[01:51:11.028 --> 01:51:16.694]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:51:17.355 --> 01:51:20.820]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
