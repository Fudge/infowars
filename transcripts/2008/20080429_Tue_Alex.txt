[00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:00.516]  I think so.
[00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:07.360]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:11.144]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:12.505 --> 00:00:17.109]  G. Edward Griffin is going to be in studio with us, coming up in about five minutes.
[00:00:17.469 --> 00:00:23.414]  Here's a little clip from Utterlyn Horowitz's video, In Lies We Trust.
[00:00:23.454 --> 00:00:31.822]  In the last 15 minutes of the show today, I'm going to play 15 minutes or so more of this, but here's a few minutes of it right now, just a taste of what's coming up.
[00:00:32.987 --> 00:00:37.329]  So, I went down to see Bill Mann at the zoo in Washington, D.C.
[00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.431]  and I told Bill Mann, I said, look, here's a, I got a problem.
[00:00:40.751 --> 00:00:41.891]  I don't know what the hell to do.
[00:00:42.832 --> 00:00:44.312]  Bill Mann is a very bright guy.
[00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:53.677]  I said, these lousy monkeys are picking it up while being stored in the airports in transit with these loading, offloading.
[00:00:54.777 --> 00:00:56.118]  He said, it's very simple.
[00:00:56.858 --> 00:01:02.081]  He said, you go ahead, get your monkeys out of West Africa and get the African green
[00:01:02.844 --> 00:01:03.966]  Bring them into Madrid.
[00:01:04.788 --> 00:01:05.569]  Unload them there.
[00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:07.833]  There are no other traffic through there for animals.
[00:01:08.174 --> 00:01:09.576]  Fly them into Philadelphia.
[00:01:09.596 --> 00:01:09.977]  Pick them up.
[00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.403]  Or fly them into New York and pick them up.
[00:01:14.024 --> 00:01:14.745]  Right off the airplane.
[00:01:16.115 --> 00:01:17.715]  So I brought African Greens in.
[00:01:17.735 --> 00:01:19.016]  I didn't know we were importing AIDS virus at the time.
[00:01:19.036 --> 00:01:19.976]  And you introduced AIDS virus in the country.
[00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:21.016]  And you introduced AIDS virus in the country.
[00:01:21.036 --> 00:01:22.416]  And you introduced AIDS virus in the country.
[00:01:22.436 --> 00:01:23.456]  And you introduced AIDS virus in the country.
[00:01:23.476 --> 00:01:24.476]  And you introduced AIDS virus in the country.
[00:01:24.536 --> 00:01:25.717]  And you introduced AIDS virus in the country.
[00:01:25.737 --> 00:01:26.717]  And you introduced AIDS virus in the country.
[00:01:26.737 --> 00:01:27.737]  And you introduced AIDS virus in the country.
[00:01:27.777 --> 00:01:28.837]  And you introduced AIDS virus in the country.
[00:01:28.877 --> 00:01:30.217]  And you introduced AIDS virus in the country.
[00:01:30.237 --> 00:01:31.218]  And you introduced AIDS virus in the country.
[00:01:31.238 --> 00:01:32.198]  And you introduced AIDS virus in the country.
[00:01:32.218 --> 00:01:33.258]  And you introduced AIDS virus in the country.
[00:01:33.278 --> 00:01:34.198]  And you introduced AIDS virus in the country.
[00:01:34.218 --> 00:01:35.478]  And you introduced AIDS virus in the country.
[00:01:35.558 --> 00:01:36.599]  And you introduced AIDS virus in the country.
[00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:37.859]  And you introduced AIDS virus in the country.
[00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:39.159]  And you introduced AIDS virus in the country.
[00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:40.179]  And you introduced AIDS virus in the country.
[00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:41.559]  And you introduced AIDS virus in the country.
[00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:42.800]  And you introduced AIDS virus in the country.
[00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.040]  And you introduced AIDS virus in the country.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.000]  And you introduced AIDS virus in
[00:01:45.578 --> 00:01:46.219]  Now we had those.
[00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:48.120]  This was the solution.
[00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:51.283]  Because those monkeys didn't have the wild viruses.
[00:01:51.423 --> 00:01:55.126]  But, we had all these... Wait, why didn't the greens have the wild viruses since they came from Africa?
[00:01:55.146 --> 00:02:02.913]  Because they weren't, well, they weren't being infected in these group-holding things with all the other 40 different viruses.
[00:02:03.293 --> 00:02:04.834]  But they had the ones they brought from the jungle, though.
[00:02:04.874 --> 00:02:07.557]  Yeah, they had those, but there were relatively few.
[00:02:07.617 --> 00:02:11.260]  What you do is you have a gang housing, you're gonna have an epidemic
[00:02:11.923 --> 00:02:14.544]  Transmission of infection in a confined space.
[00:02:14.804 --> 00:02:16.304]  Oh, is that the problem?
[00:02:16.444 --> 00:02:17.805]  So, anyway, the greens came in.
[00:02:19.365 --> 00:02:27.747]  Now we had these, and then we're taking our seed stocks to clean them up, and God, now I'm discovering new viruses.
[00:02:29.668 --> 00:02:32.549]  So, I said, shoot us, priest.
[00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:40.071]  Well, I got an invitation from the Sister Kinney Foundation, you know, which was the opposing foundation, and that was the live virus.
[00:02:40.531 --> 00:02:40.771]  Oh, right.
[00:02:41.144 --> 00:02:43.445]  Yeah, they had jumped on Sabin's bandwagon.
[00:02:43.485 --> 00:02:49.826]  And they had asked me to come down and give a talk at the Sister Kenny Foundation meeting.
[00:02:50.927 --> 00:02:52.807]  And I said, it was an international meeting.
[00:02:52.827 --> 00:02:54.588]  I said, God, what am I going to talk about?
[00:02:54.608 --> 00:02:56.508]  I know what I'm going to do.
[00:02:56.528 --> 00:03:02.710]  I'm going to talk about the detection of non-detectable viruses as a topic.
[00:03:03.271 --> 00:03:06.752]  There were those who didn't want a live virus vaccine.
[00:03:07.093 --> 00:03:07.973]  They concentrated.
[00:03:07.993 --> 00:03:17.877]  The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis concentrated all its efforts on getting more and more people to use the killed virus vaccine.
[00:03:18.878 --> 00:03:22.639]  While they were supporting me for research on a live virus vaccine.
[00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.581]  So now I gotta have something, you know, that's gonna attract attention.
[00:03:27.673 --> 00:03:29.975]  So I thought, gee, that damn SV-40.
[00:03:29.995 --> 00:03:32.917]  I mean, that damn evacuating agent that we have.
[00:03:32.977 --> 00:03:34.798]  I'm going to just pick that particular one.
[00:03:35.438 --> 00:03:38.500]  That virus has got to be in vaccines.
[00:03:38.881 --> 00:03:43.143]  And it's got to be in Sabin's vaccine, so I quickly tested it.
[00:03:44.544 --> 00:03:45.685]  Sure enough, it was in there.
[00:03:46.766 --> 00:03:47.386]  And we'll be damned.
[00:03:47.987 --> 00:03:49.968]  So now, so I go ahead and
[00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:53.631]  So you just took stocks of Sabin's vaccine off the shelf here at Merck?
[00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:55.372]  Yeah, well, it had not been made at Merck.
[00:03:55.412 --> 00:03:56.553]  It was made at Merck.
[00:03:56.593 --> 00:03:58.034]  You were making it for Sabin at this point?
[00:03:58.094 --> 00:03:59.715]  Yeah, it was made before I came.
[00:03:59.956 --> 00:04:03.478]  Yeah, but at this point Sabin is still just doing these massive field trials.
[00:04:03.538 --> 00:04:03.758]  Mm-hmm.
[00:04:03.938 --> 00:04:04.178]  Okay.
[00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:05.880]  In Russia and so forth.
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.904]  So I go down... I talked about the detection of non-technical virus.
[00:04:11.944 --> 00:04:15.987]  I told Albert... But at this point Sabin is still just doing these massive field trials.
[00:04:16.007 --> 00:04:16.267]  Mm-hmm.
[00:04:16.467 --> 00:04:16.687]  Okay.
[00:04:17.308 --> 00:04:18.388]  In Russia and so forth.
[00:04:18.448 --> 00:04:19.129]  So I go down...
[00:04:20.191 --> 00:04:24.414]  I talked about the detection of non-detectable viruses.
[00:04:24.454 --> 00:04:27.736]  I told Albert, I said, listen Albert, I said, you know, you and I are good friends.
[00:04:28.697 --> 00:04:32.439]  But I said, I'm going to go down there and you're going to get upset.
[00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:35.521]  But I'm going to talk about a virus that's in your vaccine now.
[00:04:36.582 --> 00:04:37.902]  You're going to get rid of the virus.
[00:04:37.922 --> 00:04:38.503]  Don't worry about it.
[00:04:38.543 --> 00:04:39.924]  You're going to get rid of it.
[00:04:43.006 --> 00:04:45.327]  So of course, Albert was very upset with me.
[00:04:46.788 --> 00:04:47.529]  And what did he say?
[00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:49.610]  Well, he said basically that
[00:04:49.983 --> 00:04:55.044]  This is just another obfuscation that is going to upset the vaccines.
[00:04:55.144 --> 00:04:56.865]  I said, well, you know, you're absolutely right.
[00:04:57.385 --> 00:04:59.226]  But I said, we have a new era here.
[00:04:59.246 --> 00:05:00.966]  We have a new era of detection.
[00:05:01.386 --> 00:05:03.567]  And the important thing is to get rid of these viruses.
[00:05:03.967 --> 00:05:07.888]  Why would he call it an obfuscation if it was a virus that was contaminating the vaccines?
[00:05:07.968 --> 00:05:13.070]  Because, well, there were 40 different viruses in these vaccines anyway that we were inactivating.
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.521]  But you weren't activating the... That's correct.
[00:05:17.601 --> 00:05:18.241]  No, that's right.
[00:05:18.261 --> 00:05:25.364]  But yellow fever vaccine had leukemia virus in it, and you know, this is in the days of very crude science.
[00:05:26.304 --> 00:05:30.505]  So anyway, I went down and talked to him, and I said, well, why are you concerned about it?
[00:05:31.566 --> 00:05:32.786]  I said, well, I'll tell you what.
[00:05:32.806 --> 00:05:37.128]  I said, I have a feeling in my bones that this virus is different.
[00:05:37.248 --> 00:05:40.629]  I don't know why to tell you this, but I've been around bones a long time.
[00:05:40.769 --> 00:05:43.230]  I just think this virus may have some long-term effects.
[00:05:45.456 --> 00:05:51.220]  What?
[00:05:52.221 --> 00:05:53.142]  We're on the march.
[00:05:53.622 --> 00:05:55.203]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:05:56.144 --> 00:05:58.986]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:03.930]  Hi neighbor.
[00:06:05.225 --> 00:06:06.926]  We all know that knowledge is power.
[00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:10.469]  We've tried to give you knowledge to help you prepare for rough times.
[00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:15.753]  There's the worldwide famine and our country's dependence on often dangerous food imports.
[00:06:16.394 --> 00:06:18.395]  You know about genetically poisoned food.
[00:06:18.916 --> 00:06:24.500]  Two-thirds of the food is disappearing with the bees along with huge crop failures from all-time record water shortages.
[00:06:25.221 --> 00:06:28.884]  You know they're turning food into fuel with corn ethanol plants.
[00:06:29.824 --> 00:06:33.525]  If we do not control our food, food will be used to control us.
[00:06:34.045 --> 00:06:39.206]  Food control has been the plan historically in every enslaved population and is the plan for America.
[00:06:39.886 --> 00:06:48.147]  The only value of the knowledge you have to take control of your food is if you choose to get a supply while you still have the freedom to choose.
[00:06:48.607 --> 00:06:49.848]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web, efoodsdirect.com.

[00:07:05.049 --> 00:07:07.971]  Imagine walking down the street and hearing footsteps behind you.
[00:07:08.432 --> 00:07:12.534]  They get closer and closer, and suddenly you have a sense something bad is going to happen.
[00:07:13.255 --> 00:07:14.976]  What are you going to do to defend yourself?

[00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:55.070]  John, I'm testing the mic.
[00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:55.850]  Go ahead and cut the audio.
[00:07:58.331 --> 00:07:59.772]  Yeah, go ahead and talk.
[00:08:24.861 --> 00:08:25.641]  Don't be a victim.
[00:08:26.062 --> 00:08:26.742]  Be a victor.

[00:09:38.348 --> 00:09:42.431]  We have got an hour and a half left in transmission for the next hour and 15 minutes roughly.
[00:09:42.451 --> 00:09:52.859]  G. Edward Griffin, really a legend in the alternative media, New World Order resistance movement, one of the last living icons, the great granddaddies, in the fight.
[00:09:55.041 --> 00:09:58.364]  Sharp, handsome devil for being in the fight this long.
[00:09:58.985 --> 00:10:00.706]  And it's good to have him here with us.
[00:10:00.746 --> 00:10:02.548]  Very long bio up on Wikipedia.
[00:10:02.568 --> 00:10:05.911]  A lot of different websites, scores of films he's made.
[00:10:05.991 --> 00:10:09.374]  He is, of course, the best-selling author of The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:10:09.655 --> 00:10:12.998]  He founded in 2002 Freedom Force International.
[00:10:13.418 --> 00:10:15.921]  And he is in studio with us today.
[00:10:16.221 --> 00:10:17.322]  Mr. Griffin, thanks for coming in.
[00:10:17.402 --> 00:10:18.343]  Well, thanks a lot, Alex.
[00:10:18.423 --> 00:10:19.484]  It's really a pleasure to be here.
[00:10:19.684 --> 00:10:20.825]  Well, it's a pleasure to have you with us.
[00:10:20.865 --> 00:10:24.510]  You're going to be speaking tonight later in Austin at UT at 8 o'clock.
[00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:25.992]  We'll talk about that later.
[00:10:26.172 --> 00:10:28.575]  Right now, tell us about G. Edward Griffin.
[00:10:28.595 --> 00:10:29.516]  Tell us about your life.
[00:10:29.857 --> 00:10:31.519]  Tell us about the experiences you've had.
[00:10:31.539 --> 00:10:35.684]  I mean, I know you don't like to talk about yourself, but I mean, the scope, how long you've been in this, the films you've made.
[00:10:35.984 --> 00:10:36.905]  Spend 10 minutes on that.
[00:10:37.523 --> 00:10:38.003]  Ten minutes.
[00:10:38.043 --> 00:10:39.844]  Well, you're going to lose your audience on this one.
[00:10:41.044 --> 00:10:41.965]  There's really not that much.
[00:10:42.025 --> 00:10:44.486]  I'm basically a writer, Alex, as everybody knows.
[00:10:45.026 --> 00:10:51.868]  I started into this field, this freedom field, if you want to call it that, in 1959.
[00:10:52.328 --> 00:10:54.469]  By 1960, I was up to speed.
[00:10:54.529 --> 00:10:56.310]  I was very alarmed at what was going on in the world.
[00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:02.135]  And I quit my job, which was a comfortable job with an insurance company, and I became a crusader.
[00:11:02.816 --> 00:11:07.501]  And my first issues back in those days had to do with the United Nations.
[00:11:07.521 --> 00:11:08.762]  You know, I went through school.
[00:11:08.802 --> 00:11:11.965]  I was taught that the UN was our last, best hope for peace.
[00:11:12.586 --> 00:11:17.751]  It was a means by which all nations could join together in peace and brotherhood and all that stuff.
[00:11:17.771 --> 00:11:19.413]  And I bought into it lock, stock and barrel.
[00:11:19.853 --> 00:11:29.277]  Then one day I opened up a pamphlet, and the author of the pamphlet was a college professor from some Midwest university, and he was telling me that this was all a false image.
[00:11:29.598 --> 00:11:35.620]  That what these guys actually had in mind had nothing to do with peace and brotherhood, but totalitarian control over the world.
[00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:38.001]  Well, that upset me, and I didn't believe it, of course.
[00:11:38.502 --> 00:11:40.523]  But anyway, you asked about my history.
[00:11:40.563 --> 00:11:45.805]  That is the first thing that nudged me and made me start to think about the assumptions that I had.
[00:11:45.925 --> 00:12:01.985]  And don't be shy because this journey, I mean you woke up back when hardly anybody was awake, this journey is important for other people out there who are having similar journeys and I think it's an example of what one person can do after they wake up and decide, I want to stand up for goodness, I want to stand up against evil, I want to fight corruption.
[00:12:02.901 --> 00:12:09.928]  Well, yeah, I guess that is a parallel journey that a lot of people are taking today, and so with that in mind, thanks for encouraging me.
[00:12:09.948 --> 00:12:12.150]  I guess the details are perhaps important.
[00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:13.271]  Yeah, I mean, you're a trailblazer.
[00:12:13.291 --> 00:12:13.911]  Tell us about that.
[00:12:14.312 --> 00:12:21.719]  Well, yeah, that was back in 1960, and I started to give speeches on the United Nations, and I called it the fearful master.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.141]  And that was based on a George Washington quote.
[00:12:25.481 --> 00:12:27.463]  You know, the government is not reason.
[00:12:27.843 --> 00:12:28.903]  It is not eloquence.
[00:12:29.404 --> 00:12:31.685]  It is force, like fire.
[00:12:32.206 --> 00:12:35.268]  It is a fearful master and a dangerous servant.
[00:12:35.608 --> 00:12:42.933]  So I used that theme as the title for my speech, and then I decided to write a book, and then that went from one thing to the other.
[00:12:42.953 --> 00:12:51.899]  The first video presentation I did was a film of another audio, another speech, I should say, that I was giving called The Grand Design.
[00:12:52.619 --> 00:12:56.520]  The grand design in those days was the development of U.S.
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.941]  foreign policy, which was to get rid of U.S.
[00:13:00.281 --> 00:13:06.223]  sovereignty, to create a true, what they now call fondly, the New World Order.
[00:13:07.063 --> 00:13:13.905]  And in order to do that, they needed to scare the American people with a threat of atomic holocaust.
[00:13:14.285 --> 00:13:15.826]  That was the grand design.
[00:13:16.146 --> 00:13:20.767]  So that was the first video I did, and then from there, it just went on down the line
[00:13:21.147 --> 00:13:26.413]  I've done things not always having to do with political issues.
[00:13:26.914 --> 00:13:32.761]  One of the major works that I consider to be one of the most important things I ever did was something in the field of health.
[00:13:32.781 --> 00:13:33.822]  It had to do with cancer.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:41.581]  I wrote a book called World Without Cancer, the story of vitamin B-17, which is a natural control for cancer.
[00:13:41.601 --> 00:13:44.702]  It has nothing to do with drugs, chemotherapy, or radiation.
[00:13:45.242 --> 00:13:49.183]  And I learned a lot while researching and pursuing that field.
[00:13:50.063 --> 00:13:58.765]  I did a documentary on the discovery of Noah's Ark, which was more for fun, because I've always had an interest in archaeology and ancient Earth history.
[00:13:59.285 --> 00:14:03.106]  But most of my work has been in the field of politics or freedom issues.
[00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:08.012]  And in that field, I would say the Creature from Jekyll Island is central.
[00:14:08.672 --> 00:14:09.192]  Well, thank you.
[00:14:09.292 --> 00:14:12.574]  The Creature from Jekyll Island, of course, is all about the Federal Reserve System.
[00:14:13.294 --> 00:14:18.637]  And frankly, Alex, when I wrote that thing, I really thought I was wasting my time.
[00:14:19.137 --> 00:14:20.577]  You know, it's a big, thick book.
[00:14:20.818 --> 00:14:21.938]  It's 600 and some pages.
[00:14:22.298 --> 00:14:28.061]  And I thought, nobody wants to read a big book, or even a small book, for that matter, on the subject of the Federal Reserve.
[00:14:28.121 --> 00:14:28.681]  Too dry.
[00:14:29.201 --> 00:14:32.543]  Well, much to my surprise, yeah, a lot of people wanted to read about it.
[00:14:33.323 --> 00:14:40.889]  Today, it's in its 20th printing, and I just got a call from my warehouse manager the other day saying that we have to go for number 21 now.
[00:14:41.469 --> 00:14:55.479]  So, it's amazing, and I think that the economic woes that the nation is facing had a lot to do with the public becoming more concerned with an issue that ordinarily they would not think too much about.
[00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:03.057]  You made so many other films though about Katanga and what really happened in Africa and the UN running the slaughter.
[00:15:03.217 --> 00:15:10.907]  How many films, how many presentations, how many visual, video film productions have you made?
[00:15:12.401 --> 00:15:13.081]  Good question.
[00:15:13.162 --> 00:15:16.804]  Altogether, I'd say there's about 30 or 32 somewhere in that range.
[00:15:17.464 --> 00:15:18.785]  Most of them were video.
[00:15:20.006 --> 00:15:21.647]  A few were about five or six books.
[00:15:22.348 --> 00:15:24.229]  And a lot of audio, actually.
[00:15:24.689 --> 00:15:26.210]  Audio is really my favorite medium.
[00:15:27.251 --> 00:15:34.696]  I cut my tooth, so to speak, on audio back in the days when we used to carry around these big Kedelsky
[00:15:35.736 --> 00:15:36.117]  Thank you.
[00:15:52.569 --> 00:15:58.112]  Probably the world's largest collection of original audio recordings in that genre.
[00:15:58.873 --> 00:16:14.721]  I knew that I had the second largest one because I used to go around to all of these meetings recording people and I'd run into a particular guy, his name was Harry Laney, who also had another set of Niagara's and he was an engineer that worked for IBM and it was his hobby to record these things.
[00:16:15.001 --> 00:16:20.985]  He had absolutely the greatest collection and then some years later when he passed away his widow called me and
[00:16:21.545 --> 00:16:23.587]  Asked me if I would like to have his collection.
[00:16:23.987 --> 00:16:25.969]  So now I've got his and mine.
[00:16:26.129 --> 00:16:31.053]  You need to get some volunteers to like upload all those to Google Video or Audio and get them out to people.
[00:16:31.233 --> 00:16:33.255]  I know I have, I mean thousands of them.
[00:16:33.275 --> 00:16:35.597]  You could probably put together like a twenty CD set too.
[00:16:37.038 --> 00:16:38.399]  Two thousand CD set.
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.821]  I've already converted... You make up data CDs though.
[00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:42.883]  Oh, data CDs, yeah, that would be more like it.
[00:16:43.423 --> 00:16:46.126]  Actually I have converted some of them to CDs.
[00:16:46.486 --> 00:16:48.368]  We call it the Audio Archives Series.
[00:16:49.008 --> 00:16:52.130]  I know you've got a lot of, in fact a lot of your old films people can still get.
[00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:57.173]  My buddy Chris Athanas bought most of them and aired them on Local Access TV and really woke a lot of people up.
[00:16:57.193 --> 00:17:02.257]  Yeah, a lot of old stuff, but most of that material, even though it's old, is very apropos.
[00:17:02.277 --> 00:17:04.018]  Oh no, because they just repeat the same thing.
[00:17:04.038 --> 00:17:04.958]  It's a methodology.
[00:17:05.219 --> 00:17:14.945]  Yeah, it becomes even more valuable with age, because you can realize with the passage of time that the issues are repeating and also that the opinions that we're expressing are valid.
[00:17:15.485 --> 00:17:18.647]  The things that we predicted 20 years ago have come to pass.
[00:17:45.645 --> 00:18:06.025]  Capture the attention of all those people and give them goals to try to attain now, and how do we get around all the kooks and weirdos that, and I don't try to be a gatekeeper here, I don't really try to censor or even cover people I disagree with, but there are a lot of weirdos that just because there's a vacuum with the mainstream media lying and spinning, then you have the alternative media with a lot of craziness too.
[00:18:06.585 --> 00:18:07.626]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[00:18:07.646 --> 00:18:11.147]  And that's one of the things that I deal with daily.
[00:18:11.207 --> 00:18:14.669]  We have a weekly news service we put out called Unfiltered News.
[00:18:15.189 --> 00:18:19.971]  And of course, people send me all this stuff and they get upset once in a while because I don't push it through.
[00:18:20.472 --> 00:18:25.254]  But I recognize, having been at this game for so many years, that a lot of this stuff is just nonsense.
[00:18:25.314 --> 00:18:25.874]  It's garbage.
[00:18:26.014 --> 00:18:27.515]  Well, also, there will be something divisive.
[00:18:27.535 --> 00:18:33.818]  Like, you've got to say it's all the Jews and they secretly drink blood, and they work for the Vatican, and they're under control of reptoids.
[00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:38.452]  And I'm just here saying, hey, I want to fight the globalist system.
[00:18:38.472 --> 00:18:49.062]  If we get into arguing about who controls it all day, I mean, I do cover that some, then, I mean, that gets into cliques and balkanization instead of a message of more liberty, more freedom, UN bad, global government bad.
[00:18:49.262 --> 00:18:50.123]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:18:50.443 --> 00:18:56.268]  I'm so glad to hear you say that, Alex, because that is a pitfall that's, I think, deliberately put out there by our enemies.
[00:18:56.588 --> 00:18:58.170]  They want us to step into those traps.
[00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:00.092]  And, yeah, we can't do that.
[00:19:00.672 --> 00:19:09.814]  But you know, in this business of predicting what's coming in the future, two days after 9-11, I sat down, like a lot of people did, and wrote something out.
[00:19:09.854 --> 00:19:19.696]  You know, we were speaking from passion, speaking from emotion, the event was so overpowering, a lot of us just wanted to put something in writing to capture our thoughts and our feelings.
[00:19:20.196 --> 00:19:22.117]  Well, that particular day, I started a
[00:19:23.777 --> 00:19:23.977]  Thank you.
[00:19:40.958 --> 00:19:42.559]  I didn't know whether I should publish these or not.
[00:19:43.179 --> 00:19:45.000]  And I decided to publish them.
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:50.622]  And I'm unhappy to say that every one of those predictions has come to pass.
[00:19:50.642 --> 00:19:51.322]  That's what I always say.
[00:19:51.402 --> 00:19:53.243]  Unfortunately, we've been right.
[00:19:53.343 --> 00:19:57.684]  And 9 times out of 10, it actually is worse than what we originally said.
[00:19:57.724 --> 00:19:59.365]  Go over some of those 13 and what's happened.
[00:19:59.685 --> 00:20:04.326]  Oh, well, anybody that studied the world events could make most of those predictions.
[00:20:04.686 --> 00:20:16.830]  You know, I talked about the fact that they would soon discover that the FBI and the intelligence agencies of the federal government had advanced knowledge of this attack, but did nothing to stop it.
[00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:18.130]  I made that prediction.
[00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:28.453]  I made the prediction that one that really went furthest out on the limb was that they would take a long, long time to find Osama bin Laden.
[00:20:29.113 --> 00:20:37.156]  Even though at the moment they were all, we're not going to stop searching the world until we find Osama Bin Laden and bring him to justice for these crimes.
[00:20:37.256 --> 00:20:40.858]  And you knew that because you knew they needed a boogeyman, and you've seen this time and time again.
[00:20:41.078 --> 00:20:42.738]  I knew that they needed the boogeyman.
[00:20:42.798 --> 00:20:53.883]  They needed Osama Bin Laden as some kind of a figure, a symbol of the enemy that the American people could look at and say, we hate this man, we hate this man.
[00:20:54.923 --> 00:20:57.344]  It's a ploy that's been used so many times before in history.
[00:20:57.664 --> 00:20:59.185]  So that's the kind of thing, Alex.
[00:20:59.685 --> 00:21:03.206]  You know, people look at me today and they say, how did you know all these things were going to happen?
[00:21:03.587 --> 00:21:07.108]  And I have to say, in all humility, you don't have to be a rocket scientist.
[00:21:07.488 --> 00:21:11.070]  All you have to do is just see how these elitists are running the show.
[00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:12.170]  They're pathological.
[00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:13.831]  They're obsessive-compulsive.
[00:21:13.871 --> 00:21:23.035]  In fact, when you read about Prince Charles or Prince Philip or the Queen of England or the Rothschilds or the Rockefellers, it's almost like they are predatory, psychopathic types, control freaks, sadistic types.
[00:21:23.775 --> 00:21:27.236]  And they're also, if you read about them, they're obsessed with everything being just right.
[00:21:27.256 --> 00:21:30.957]  You know, every light bulb not being burned out, every yard being cut just perfect.
[00:21:31.337 --> 00:21:36.338]  I mean, they're really neurotic and they, it seems to be a type, you know, a psychological type.
[00:21:36.378 --> 00:21:40.099]  Of course, there's variance there, but it seems that we've got their M.O.
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:44.981]  and they just repeat things with this methodology, this formula, over and over again.
[00:21:45.001 --> 00:21:45.641]  Can you speak to that?
[00:21:46.241 --> 00:21:46.662]  Well, yeah.
[00:21:46.902 --> 00:21:48.824]  All I can say, basically, is I agree totally.
[00:21:48.844 --> 00:21:59.073]  The first thing to observe, I believe, about this is that the ones who are making the decisions, that's not everybody in the organization structure, but the ones at the very top are very smart people.
[00:21:59.373 --> 00:22:00.795]  They're intellectuals.
[00:22:01.175 --> 00:22:06.540]  They're well-read, they're well-versed in history, and they're philosophers.
[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:14.026]  And they have an ideology that they have thought through, they're completely aligned with it, they have allegiance to it.
[00:22:14.427 --> 00:22:21.433]  Once you understand what their ideology is and what their goals are, then that's when you begin to predict
[00:22:21.893 --> 00:22:23.034]  What would I do if I believed that?
[00:22:33.499 --> 00:22:35.040]  Let me ask you this question then.
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:41.225]  I mean, to boil down in a simple fashion their ideology, it's N justifies the means.
[00:22:41.605 --> 00:22:43.106]  You're always going to have an elite.
[00:22:43.587 --> 00:22:45.508]  We are an enlightened elite is their view.
[00:22:45.989 --> 00:22:48.511]  Yes, we want to exterminate the majority of the population.
[00:22:48.551 --> 00:22:52.894]  Yes, we're for eugenics, but that's survival of the fittest, that's social Darwinism.
[00:22:53.755 --> 00:22:55.796]  If we don't do it, somebody else will do it.
[00:22:56.117 --> 00:23:00.160]  And so, yes, we stage terror attacks, but it's for the greater good to get these Muslims under control.
[00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:10.045]  Yes, we do put cancer viruses in a lot of the vaccines to get rid of people when they're 65, so we don't have to pay for their retirement.
[00:23:10.085 --> 00:23:10.785]  Logan's run.
[00:23:11.425 --> 00:23:13.947]  Yes, we do militarize the police.
[00:23:14.007 --> 00:23:16.848]  We do bring the drugs in, but if the lower class is dumb enough to use them,
[00:23:17.148 --> 00:23:18.189]  We're going to put them in prison.
[00:23:18.489 --> 00:23:32.815]  You know, slavery has always been the way it is, and we've got to take care of ourselves, and they get into a power position, too, where they always are being threatened by their own systems, their own competing elites, and so it's a synthesis of evil to where even if you get
[00:23:33.355 --> 00:23:53.427]  Somewhat friendly or the benevolent dictator, they always get removed and the centralized pyramidal power structure allows an elitist or gaggle of elitists, who are the most ruthless, it's kind of a survival of the most ruthless, get into those penultimate positions of power, so by a process of elimination through
[00:23:53.507 --> 00:24:00.729]  Through a type of hyper-social Darwinism, you do get the most psychopathic, intelligent, cunning groups.
[00:24:00.869 --> 00:24:03.830]  Then power tends to amass in more centralized hands.
[00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:06.671]  Then they become inbred, decadent, and insane.
[00:24:06.851 --> 00:24:14.314]  But then psychopathic, intelligent bureaucracies grow up around them to defend them and protect them as the institutions themselves
[00:24:14.694 --> 00:24:15.495]  Do you agree with that?
[00:24:34.637 --> 00:24:40.807]  Well, you said it so well that I can't think of any way to summarize it any better than what you just did.
[00:24:40.867 --> 00:24:41.728]  Well, you can.
[00:24:41.748 --> 00:24:42.790]  I want you to elaborate on that.
[00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:44.132]  I mean, what's their philosophy?
[00:24:44.172 --> 00:24:45.494]  You've been around longer.
[00:24:45.554 --> 00:24:46.356]  You've fought them.
[00:24:46.396 --> 00:24:47.097]  You've confronted them.
[00:24:47.117 --> 00:24:47.798]  You've talked to them.
[00:24:48.018 --> 00:24:49.000]  I mean, what's their main system?
[00:24:49.921 --> 00:25:01.948]  The one aspect of the many things you covered that really stuck in my mind is the truth that in the beginning there's always some kind of a high ideal that drives these men and these women.
[00:25:02.328 --> 00:25:07.371]  They're always going to do something for, and here's the key phrase, for the greater good of the greater number.
[00:25:07.951 --> 00:25:14.273]  And you're going to find that element behind all of the different variants of collectivism.
[00:25:15.033 --> 00:25:32.679]  And I think when we're talking about something like this, we have to recognize the common denominator of all of these ideologies of communism, fascism, Nazism, socialism, all of these things that we know historically have proven to be horrible systems under which to live.
[00:25:34.339 --> 00:25:37.783]  The common ideology beneath them all is called collectivism.
[00:25:38.624 --> 00:25:44.271]  And the keynote, or the cornerstone, I should say, of collectivism is this thought that
[00:25:45.816 --> 00:25:52.258]  The individual must be sacrificed, if necessary, for the greater good of the greater number.
[00:25:52.619 --> 00:25:55.500]  And so that is the ether in which this system survives?
[00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:57.981]  That is the fertilizer, the ether, whatever it is.
[00:25:58.201 --> 00:26:05.323]  And it always starts off with this justification, well, it's too bad, we have to sacrifice this person, or that minority, or those 3,000 people.
[00:26:07.384 --> 00:26:20.035]  Those two million people, whatever it is, as long as the number being sacrificed is smaller than the number supposedly being benefited, then they can claim the mantle of being benevolent, that they're really helping society.
[00:26:20.055 --> 00:26:23.859]  How should that go back to the military ideal of, I'm going to put a hundred troops out there to draw in the enemy?
[00:26:24.099 --> 00:26:28.583]  That hundred's going to get killed, but then we're going to win the battle and that'll save more of our troops in the end.
[00:26:28.723 --> 00:26:30.807]  That is exactly the philosophy we're talking about.
[00:26:31.147 --> 00:26:34.213]  And there is some justification for it on the battlefield, of course.
[00:26:34.513 --> 00:26:41.585]  But when it comes to building a whole political and social system on that principle, you've got some real issues involving human rights.
[00:26:41.977 --> 00:26:47.741]  And then you get a bunch of inbred elites on power trips, nihilistically running around building anti-matter weapons.
[00:26:48.682 --> 00:26:50.063]  G. Edward Griffin is our guest.
[00:26:50.083 --> 00:26:53.486]  We'll tell you about his website, his organizations, and a lot more after this quick break.
[00:26:53.506 --> 00:26:54.146]  This is amazing.
[00:26:54.587 --> 00:26:57.229]  I may just go into overdrive today so we can play the Horowitz video.
[00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:59.230]  We might just go to three with Mr. Griffin if he can do that.
[00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:01.072]  And we'll take some calls coming up in the next hour.
[00:27:01.092 --> 00:27:01.452]  Stay with me.
[00:27:02.212 --> 00:27:03.633]  It is a big idea.
[00:27:04.714 --> 00:27:05.735]  A new world order.
[00:27:06.456 --> 00:27:10.739]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:16.204]  We're here behind scenes with Mr. Gilbert Griffin during this three minute break.
[00:27:36.325 --> 00:27:41.528]  I mean, I don't want the main audience to miss anything, but also for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and folks listening on the web right now.
[00:27:42.569 --> 00:27:44.049]  What are you most excited about right now?
[00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:45.350]  What are some of the issues?
[00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:47.932]  I mean, I brought up quite a few I want to talk about, but we didn't really have a pre-interview.
[00:27:48.252 --> 00:27:49.953]  What are some of the things you want to cover in the next hour?
[00:27:51.516 --> 00:27:56.979]  To me, the most exciting thing is the rising potential to do something about these problems.
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:07.026]  Up until fairly recently, I think most people, even those who are aware, have been running around like chickens with their heads cut off, not knowing what to do about it.
[00:28:07.766 --> 00:28:18.753]  And the exciting thing to me, Alex, is that now we're talking sense to people about what are we going to do to reverse this trend, and talking very realistically in terms of coming to power.
[00:28:19.293 --> 00:28:24.195]  We know that we can't do anything as long as our solution is to write letters to our congressmen.
[00:28:24.555 --> 00:28:26.516]  Congressmen, for the most part, are the problem.
[00:28:26.776 --> 00:28:32.238]  So why are we wasting our time writing letters to the guys that are creating the problem, saying, oh please, won't you be nice to us?
[00:28:32.278 --> 00:28:33.639]  Won't you listen to our petitions?
[00:28:34.079 --> 00:28:35.740]  And that's been the game we've played for too long.
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:36.220]  Well that's a big one.
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.781]  So let's spend a lot of time on solutions.
[00:28:38.521 --> 00:28:40.462]  I want to talk about your event tonight.
[00:28:40.482 --> 00:28:43.743]  I also want to talk about, you want to talk about the election some?
[00:28:43.763 --> 00:28:45.824]  What are some of the other issues you want to discuss, not just solutions?
[00:28:46.454 --> 00:28:47.095]  Well, let's see.
[00:28:47.135 --> 00:28:48.056]  The elections are good.
[00:28:48.497 --> 00:28:48.917]  What else?
[00:28:49.017 --> 00:28:50.119]  The economy, of course.
[00:28:50.139 --> 00:28:51.200]  Let's do that first.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.063]  Let's do economy, then solutions.
[00:28:53.303 --> 00:28:55.446]  Well, the economy, elections and solutions.
[00:28:55.486 --> 00:28:55.766]  Fine.
[00:28:56.007 --> 00:28:56.828]  And we'll take some calls.
[00:28:57.128 --> 00:28:58.750]  And if it's okay, we'll just go right to three o'clock.
[00:28:59.171 --> 00:28:59.471]  You bet.
[00:28:59.711 --> 00:28:59.952]  Okay.
[00:29:00.252 --> 00:29:04.297]  I'm going to pull up that video that's on Prison Planet.
[00:29:05.293 --> 00:29:10.820]  It's from two hours and like four minutes in is the part I want to play it from.
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:11.821]  I'll show you, Wes.
[00:29:12.041 --> 00:29:15.265]  We'll play that at the end of the show as an overdrive because I promised to play it for the listeners.
[00:29:16.146 --> 00:29:17.267]  Or maybe tomorrow I'll play it.
[00:29:17.287 --> 00:29:17.668]  Who knows?
[00:29:18.148 --> 00:29:19.330]  Okay, we're going to go live right now.
[00:29:21.348 --> 00:29:26.312]  ...cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage in only one tank full.
[00:29:26.552 --> 00:29:31.055]  Protective engine treatment not only reduces friction, but it extends the life of your engine.
[00:29:31.355 --> 00:29:34.818]  Let's face it, with the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[00:29:35.118 --> 00:29:41.403]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment, which is a $12.95 value free.
[00:29:43.104 --> 00:29:45.186]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:29:45.407 --> 00:29:48.670]  That number again is 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:52.293]  Or check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com.
[00:29:52.594 --> 00:29:54.315]  That's oilcompanysecret.com.
[00:29:54.776 --> 00:29:57.178]  Satisfaction is guaranteed, or your money back.
[00:29:57.619 --> 00:29:59.040]  And it's safe for all cars.
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:29:59.581]  Act now.
[00:30:07.763 --> 00:30:14.385]  If you live in Central Texas, you'll be able to hop in your car, or ride with your friends, carpool, down at the University of Texas.
[00:30:14.945 --> 00:30:16.646]  Plenty of parking in the surrounding area.
[00:30:17.166 --> 00:30:21.567]  At night, UT campus, 8pm to 9.45pm.
[00:30:21.987 --> 00:30:23.268]  Not plenty of parking during the day.
[00:30:23.968 --> 00:30:24.628]  We're good to go.
[00:30:43.456 --> 00:31:06.642]  The message is, the Quigley Formula and the mission of Freedom Force International, more info at the event and parking, is at PNAC, PNACITIZEN.ORG, PNACITIZEN.ORG, book signing and Brave New Books afterwards, I would imagine at 10 o'clock at night, because it's at 8pm to 9.45, then 15 minutes later after a break, across the street, it's about a block away,
[00:31:07.522 --> 00:31:12.745]  They're at Brave New Books right there on the end of Guadalupe at the end of the drag, right at the start of the drag.
[00:31:13.126 --> 00:31:16.748]  UT campus, 8pm to 9.45pm, Jester dorm, room A121A.
[00:31:16.908 --> 00:31:19.009]  Now I would love to go see this.
[00:31:19.049 --> 00:31:20.490]  People always ask, why don't I come out to events?
[00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:25.693]  I'm going to be on BBC 5 for a debate tonight, maybe for a whole hour.
[00:31:25.713 --> 00:31:26.914]  They're saying for at least half the hour.
[00:31:26.934 --> 00:31:28.315]  That means it's going to be a real attack piece.
[00:31:28.695 --> 00:31:29.696]  Won't tell you how long you're on.
[00:31:30.456 --> 00:31:34.039]  And then for three hours, I'm going to be on Raleigh James Nationwide tonight at that time.
[00:31:34.059 --> 00:31:36.041]  So I can't be there, but believe me, I wish I would be there.
[00:31:36.441 --> 00:31:37.422]  I'd love to go to these events.
[00:31:37.963 --> 00:31:40.325]  But I hope you will go to this event tonight.
[00:31:40.645 --> 00:31:41.205]  Room A121A.
[00:31:41.386 --> 00:31:44.809]  People think I'm not being friendly, that I don't ever go to these events.
[00:31:44.849 --> 00:31:46.210]  I just can't because I'm tied down.
[00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:47.191]  In the fight.
[00:31:47.451 --> 00:32:02.149]  Do you ever, Gilbert Griffin, do you ever get frustrated because you've been a prolific, creative guy, doing more now than ever, that there's just so much you want to do, so many people you want to warn, so many facts you've got, but then you've got so much info that it's just, there's not enough time in the day to do it all.
[00:32:03.886 --> 00:32:04.907]  Do I ever get that way?
[00:32:05.228 --> 00:32:06.329]  I'm constantly that way.
[00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:16.841]  But I decided some years ago that I had to put a lid on it because otherwise I'd be so filled with anxiety and frustration I wouldn't be able to think straight.
[00:32:16.881 --> 00:32:17.361]  That's me!
[00:32:17.922 --> 00:32:19.163]  Well, I didn't say that!
[00:32:21.005 --> 00:32:23.326]  But that's the way I was when I was your age, actually.
[00:32:23.746 --> 00:32:27.868]  And then I realized it was getting to my health, and so I kind of backed off a little bit.
[00:32:28.529 --> 00:32:30.050]  And people say, oh, you're so calm now.
[00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:31.910]  Nothing seems to bother you.
[00:32:32.331 --> 00:32:34.992]  They have no idea what fire is raging inside.
[00:32:35.012 --> 00:32:38.914]  Yeah, constant frustration and anxiety about what's going on in the world.
[00:32:39.374 --> 00:32:44.176]  But somewhere along the line, you know, as you mature, you think, well, okay, you've got to survive all of this.
[00:32:44.196 --> 00:32:44.817]  You've got to live.
[00:32:44.877 --> 00:32:48.298]  So cool down and take it, you know, one step at a time.
[00:32:48.478 --> 00:32:49.199]  That's what I try and do.
[00:32:50.316 --> 00:32:50.957]  Absolutely.
[00:32:51.257 --> 00:32:54.040]  We're going to break and start the fourth hour here in a moment.
[00:32:54.661 --> 00:33:00.127]  I asked you what you wanted to talk about in the last segment for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and people listening to my streams on the internet.
[00:33:00.167 --> 00:33:02.370]  InfoWars had a chance to hear that behind the scenes discussion.
[00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:04.152]  People can go to those streams if they want to hear.
[00:33:04.192 --> 00:33:07.315]  Some of us will be having next hour so we can use as much of the hour
[00:33:08.156 --> 00:33:08.697]  As we can.
[00:33:09.478 --> 00:33:13.041]  But I want to go over what you want to discuss.
[00:33:13.061 --> 00:33:15.403]  The economy, the election, and then solutions.
[00:33:16.344 --> 00:33:20.848]  And so we'll spend the whole hour on that, maybe take a few calls, but we've got about a minute left.
[00:33:20.868 --> 00:33:21.929]  Let's start with the economy.
[00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:25.833]  Well, the economy, I think everyone recognizes, is in meltdown.
[00:33:26.513 --> 00:33:30.417]  And why is it in meltdown is the big thing, and what can you do about it?
[00:33:30.962 --> 00:33:40.405]  It's in meltdown because the Federal Reserve System, under the watchful eye of the Federal Government, has pumped too much money into the system.
[00:33:40.946 --> 00:33:50.489]  They spent too much, they didn't want to raise taxes in order to pay for what they're spending, and so they decided to take it from the taxpayers in the form of inflation.
[00:33:50.809 --> 00:33:53.290]  That's, in a 30-second summary, that's what's going on.
[00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:55.692]  Do you think they've done this by design?
[00:33:55.712 --> 00:33:58.035]  A. Is it a unified banking camp?
[00:33:58.335 --> 00:34:01.759]  That's a sub of A. And then B. How bad will it get?
[00:34:03.593 --> 00:34:07.394]  I think it is by design on the part of the people that make the decisions.
[00:34:07.414 --> 00:34:18.298]  I think there are a lot of people in middle management, people who are part of the system without even knowing really what they're doing, that probably would never consciously design to throw away the American economy.
[00:34:18.898 --> 00:34:20.699]  They're just riding along, it's a great ride.
[00:34:21.019 --> 00:34:28.601]  But at the very top, I think that the people at the Federal Reserve level, for example, have known all along that that is the end of the line.
[00:34:29.021 --> 00:34:30.282]  And so they have had a plan B.
[00:34:31.042 --> 00:34:31.663]  I agree.
[00:34:31.683 --> 00:34:32.143]  Stay there.
[00:34:32.203 --> 00:34:32.503]  Stay there.
[00:34:32.543 --> 00:34:36.106]  And that's why they're building the camps, gearing up the police, handing out machine guns.
[00:34:36.146 --> 00:34:38.948]  They know that when they take it all, the yuppies are going to riot.
[00:34:38.968 --> 00:34:42.591]  We'll be right back.
[00:34:42.631 --> 00:34:43.772]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:36:22.059 --> 00:36:24.721]  I like to meet this guy in person after all these years.
[00:36:25.742 --> 00:36:29.385]  And Dr. Len Horowitz is going to be popping in for about five minutes today.
[00:36:29.926 --> 00:36:34.769]  Reverend Jeremiah Wright talked about his book about the engineering of AIDS, which we know is declassified.
[00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:37.031]  That and other classes of autoimmune viruses.
[00:36:37.091 --> 00:36:40.154]  It's kind of a cover for a whole host of things that are race-specific.
[00:36:41.074 --> 00:36:42.515]  I mean, my dad's a physician.
[00:36:42.556 --> 00:36:44.417]  He talked to medical doctors back in the 80s.
[00:36:44.437 --> 00:36:45.838]  He's like, son, it's a bioweapon.
[00:36:46.219 --> 00:36:51.563]  We all know it's almost impossible for whites to get it unless you've been taking heavy metal, you know, based drugs.
[00:36:51.603 --> 00:36:59.970]  You know, the inside, you know, info is that this is a... I'm like, my dad's crazy, you know, I'm thinking when I'm, you know, a little, you know, teenager.
[00:37:00.231 --> 00:37:01.572]  And then it all turned out to be true.
[00:37:01.892 --> 00:37:03.974]  They knew back then, it was just knowledge.
[00:37:04.014 --> 00:37:05.155]  My dad wasn't even into this stuff.
[00:37:05.475 --> 00:37:06.936]  I mean, it was just common knowledge.
[00:37:06.956 --> 00:37:11.078]  He's going to pop in for five minutes today and then he'll be with us for an hour tomorrow.
[00:37:11.358 --> 00:37:12.719]  Geoward Griffin is our guest.
[00:37:12.899 --> 00:37:23.685]  Continuing, sir, continuing with what you were talking about when I said, is this engineered or is this happening just because there's such bad managers?
[00:37:24.705 --> 00:37:41.207]  Well, I think that the people who make the policy decisions at the Federal Reserve level, and above, by the way, Federal Reserve is, I think your listeners probably know this, the Federal Reserve is not a government agency, it's a cartel, it's a banking cartel.
[00:37:42.007 --> 00:37:50.434]  And Bernanke and all the people on the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve, they're not really at the top of the pinnacle of this structure.
[00:37:50.514 --> 00:37:51.715]  They're not the private shareholders?
[00:37:51.735 --> 00:37:57.660]  They're not the private shareholders, they're not the ones that make the decisions, but they make the minor decisions, they execute the major ones.
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:04.866]  So somebody has told them at the banking level that they want to do whatever is best for the interest of the banks.
[00:38:05.626 --> 00:38:15.935]  Now, they don't want to kill the golden goose that lays the egg, so they would like to see the American economy as prosperous as possible, as long as the interests of the banks come first.
[00:38:16.476 --> 00:38:26.825]  And I've always said that whenever there was a direct conflict between the interests of the banks and the interests of the nation, you can be sure that the decisions would be made in favor of the banks.
[00:38:27.225 --> 00:38:31.527]  Now we're beginning to see that unfold, where almost anybody can see it.
[00:38:31.867 --> 00:38:46.654]  And so, the point of all that is that they have known from the very beginning, back when this thing was formed in 1913, that somewhere down the line, pushing the interests of the banks ahead of the interests of the people, was going to have a consequence.
[00:38:46.974 --> 00:38:49.876]  And that was the consequence of inflating the money supply.
[00:38:50.616 --> 00:39:03.044]  And that would lead to inflation, that would lead eventually to the destruction of the American Monetary Unit, the Federal Reserve note, and somewhere down the line they knew that the price would have to be paid for that.
[00:39:03.725 --> 00:39:05.766]  Now, that doesn't mean they wanted to see it happen.
[00:39:06.106 --> 00:39:10.789]  That doesn't mean they accelerated it or anything like that, but they have known it was going to happen.
[00:39:10.829 --> 00:39:17.634]  Well, I mean, even, I keep mentioning these articles, but even the Sunday Times of London, it was Neocon, but the Financial Times of London, which is
[00:39:18.574 --> 00:39:19.555]  Pretty open about what they're doing.
[00:39:19.836 --> 00:39:23.379]  Had the headline that big central banks stand to gain from subprime crisis.
[00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:28.625]  And they admit that they're getting all this government money that inflates our money, but they're getting it for free.
[00:39:28.965 --> 00:39:31.848]  And then they're going in and buying up their competition.
[00:39:31.888 --> 00:39:35.071]  So they reduced the regulations in the 90s.
[00:39:35.532 --> 00:39:37.394]  They flooded everything with cheap liquidity.
[00:39:37.694 --> 00:39:39.376]  And now they're picking up all the real assets.
[00:39:39.676 --> 00:39:43.639]  Oh right, and they're picking it up not with their own money, but with taxpayers' money.
[00:39:43.799 --> 00:39:44.219]  Exactly.
[00:39:44.299 --> 00:40:00.351]  That's the hidden part that people miss, because one of the purposes of the Federal Reserve, and the same thing with the Bank of England and the central banks in the other countries of the world, is to make this partnership between the banks and the government, so that when the banks needed to be bailed out,
[00:40:00.771 --> 00:40:13.320]  The government would step in as a partner and use taxpayers' money to bail out the banks, to bail out their bad investment decisions, and they would sell it to the people as though this was somehow in the interest of the economy.
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:14.861]  This was preserving the economy.
[00:40:14.901 --> 00:40:16.462]  This was protecting the people.
[00:40:16.782 --> 00:40:18.824]  And that's what we see unfolding today.
[00:40:19.524 --> 00:40:24.930]  But back to the other thing, which is what they expect to see happen at the end of this game.
[00:40:25.991 --> 00:40:29.114]  They have known that the economy was going to melt down at some point.
[00:40:29.495 --> 00:40:30.496]  So what are they going to do about it?
[00:40:30.536 --> 00:40:34.019]  Just wait and then see if they can survive the chaos?
[00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:34.560]  No.
[00:40:35.101 --> 00:40:36.242]  These people are too smart for that.
[00:40:36.542 --> 00:40:37.883]  They want to be in control of the implosion.
[00:40:37.903 --> 00:40:39.804]  They want to be in control of the implosion.
[00:40:40.204 --> 00:40:40.865]  Stay there, stay there.
[00:40:40.885 --> 00:40:43.807]  We've got a break for listeners listening to the InfoWars streams.
[00:40:43.827 --> 00:40:46.528]  We're going to continue during the break and we'll be right back on the other side.
[00:40:46.548 --> 00:40:58.256]  We're going to get into the election, the staged election, Gilbert Griffin's take on that, some of the new books and videos he's got out, as well as his classic Creature from Jekyll Island, and your phone calls and a lot of solutions.
[00:40:58.276 --> 00:40:58.696]  Stay with us.
[00:41:03.661 --> 00:41:08.645]  Okay, during the three-minute break we've got, I want to squeeze solutions in.
[00:41:08.665 --> 00:41:13.449]  We're going to come back and have the banking discussion, but if we can put on the other hat and get into solutions, kind of a preview.
[00:41:13.729 --> 00:41:19.474]  What do you think the basic solutions are, some of the best ideas, most effective things we can do right now?
[00:41:19.534 --> 00:41:20.815]  And I've always said the simple thing.
[00:41:21.135 --> 00:41:26.979]  Because it's not that sophisticated, but it's wake people up, show them who the enemy is, show the man behind the curtain.
[00:41:27.239 --> 00:41:31.761]  We've got to show them there's a man behind the curtain before they know what to do about the man behind the curtain.
[00:41:31.781 --> 00:41:35.784]  But now we're starting to get numbers that are big enough where we can do something about the man behind the curtain.
[00:41:36.599 --> 00:41:36.839]  Right.
[00:41:37.059 --> 00:41:38.160]  Well, yeah, you're quite right.
[00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:40.542]  There's a two-stage strategy here.
[00:41:40.942 --> 00:41:44.385]  Our forces, up until fairly recently, have not been large enough to do anything.
[00:41:44.685 --> 00:41:46.847]  We can just talk about it, but nothing's going to happen.
[00:41:47.407 --> 00:41:56.494]  But once we do have that critical mass, where we have enough people, then the question, where are we going to put these people, what are we going to ask them to do, and what can they do?
[00:41:57.515 --> 00:42:08.482]  My answer is not as popular as I wish it were, because what I'm basically saying is that we are not going to be able to turn this mess around by 2008.
[00:42:10.303 --> 00:42:18.368]  Many people are concerned with solving the problem for the next election, and that's the extent of their vision.
[00:42:19.089 --> 00:42:25.373]  If you can't offer them a solution for winning the election and turning everything around, they don't want to talk to you.
[00:42:25.993 --> 00:42:28.555]  Well, my message is that it cannot be done.
[00:42:28.976 --> 00:42:31.898]  We cannot solve all these problems by the next election.
[00:42:32.279 --> 00:42:34.881]  So if that's your time span, forget it.
[00:42:34.901 --> 00:42:36.022]  We have nothing to discuss.
[00:42:36.602 --> 00:42:46.511]  But if you have a longer view of history... Well, that's how they short-circuit us, is they get us to think about this week, this month, the distraction of the simulated election, instead of the real architecture.
[00:42:47.372 --> 00:42:51.634]  The architecture, the groundswell, the building of a movement that's going to go well past 2008.
[00:42:52.795 --> 00:42:54.056]  Now we do have solutions.
[00:42:54.676 --> 00:42:57.898]  And, of course, that's the reason I created Freedom Force International.
[00:42:58.258 --> 00:43:11.145]  I think Freedom Force can become the structure, or the gyroscope, so to speak, that can lead people into creative, effective, reasonable, and realistic solutions.
[00:43:11.325 --> 00:43:22.827]  I think we need something like attack profiles, where we just put out blueprints that can be duplicated by cells, and not that we're anything illegal, it's just that so they're leaderless, but they go off a main manifesto.
[00:43:23.348 --> 00:43:31.729]  And so it's coordinated, it's uncoordinated, which is the nature of liberty lovers, but then at the same time it's a basic ideal that guides it.
[00:43:31.749 --> 00:43:34.430]  It's like a million missiles that are guided by the same trajectory.
[00:43:34.952 --> 00:43:35.633]  Yes, I agree.
[00:43:35.833 --> 00:43:39.515]  But the issue that no one has really addressed is what?
[00:43:40.396 --> 00:43:41.496]  What are they going to do?
[00:43:41.777 --> 00:43:42.237]  Exactly.
[00:43:42.317 --> 00:43:47.100]  So, when we come back after we talk more about the economy, I want to get into what you think they should do.
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:48.561]  We're going to go live right now.
[00:44:01.613 --> 00:44:06.634]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:44:07.014 --> 00:44:09.275]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:44:25.549 --> 00:44:29.151]  Geo McGriffin is our guest, author and preacher from Jekyll Island.
[00:44:29.171 --> 00:44:31.853]  He's got a lot of different websites.
[00:44:32.533 --> 00:44:35.134]  One of them is Freedom-Force.org.
[00:44:35.515 --> 00:44:37.296]  Freedom-Force.org.
[00:44:37.316 --> 00:44:40.237]  We've got a link at the top of the main page of InfoWars.com.
[00:44:40.257 --> 00:44:42.198]  We'll tell you about some more of his great sites.
[00:44:42.238 --> 00:44:42.819]  Filmmaker.
[00:44:43.619 --> 00:44:44.180]  A lot of you
[00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:45.620]  We're good to go.
[00:45:01.286 --> 00:45:05.429]  I guess now, 48 years ago when you got started, they're throwing rocks in the pond.
[00:45:05.449 --> 00:45:06.370]  There are very few people.
[00:45:06.831 --> 00:45:12.195]  Before we get back to the economy, then the election, and then real solutions, who are some of the other icons?
[00:45:12.215 --> 00:45:14.637]  I mean, who do you think of as real icons?
[00:45:14.697 --> 00:45:17.299]  Who else was around when you were doing what you were doing?
[00:45:17.319 --> 00:45:20.462]  And who were some mentors that woke Gilbert Griffin up?
[00:45:21.192 --> 00:45:22.794]  Well, there are two names that come to mind.
[00:45:23.215 --> 00:45:26.378]  One, probably nobody ever heard of today, and that was Dan Smoot.
[00:45:27.079 --> 00:45:29.062]  Dan Smoot was a former... The Smoot Report.
[00:45:29.122 --> 00:45:29.863]  The Smoot Report.
[00:45:29.903 --> 00:45:31.064]  Well, you heard of it then, yes.
[00:45:31.965 --> 00:45:33.127]  Dan Smoot was a little guy.
[00:45:33.147 --> 00:45:39.074]  He used to work for the FBI, and he quit his job because he didn't think that his work for the FBI was...
[00:45:40.035 --> 00:45:42.436]  Constructive enough, and he became a communicator.
[00:45:42.736 --> 00:45:49.217]  And he put out the Dan Smoot Report, and he had a television program very similar to what you're doing here, Alex.
[00:45:49.877 --> 00:45:53.238]  Except in those days it was all filmed on 16mm film.
[00:45:53.258 --> 00:45:55.278]  It was a place in Texas somewhere.
[00:45:55.698 --> 00:46:01.720]  Anyway, Dan Smoot was one of the great mentors for me.
[00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:07.641]  And I remember one time thinking, as I was reading Dan Smoot Report, I wish I could write like that.
[00:46:08.121 --> 00:46:09.621]  With such clarity of thought.
[00:46:09.881 --> 00:46:11.342]  With no garbage in it.
[00:46:11.402 --> 00:46:13.122]  Right to the point and very succinct.
[00:46:13.402 --> 00:46:14.022]  So Dan Smoot.
[00:46:14.462 --> 00:46:18.003]  Another one that is a more controversial figure would be Robert Welch.
[00:46:18.503 --> 00:46:20.263]  He was the founder of the John Birch Society.
[00:46:20.303 --> 00:46:21.564]  I don't know why it was controversial.
[00:46:21.724 --> 00:46:24.444]  Well, it was controversial because most people think that he was a kook.
[00:46:24.564 --> 00:46:25.204]  He was a real nut.
[00:46:25.224 --> 00:46:30.345]  Oh, how dare him think that there's big banks financing the communists, which is now all declassified.
[00:46:30.365 --> 00:46:33.266]  I mean, on History Channel, they admit the CIA put Mao in now.
[00:46:33.926 --> 00:46:34.107]  Yeah.
[00:46:34.467 --> 00:46:41.436]  Well, back in the 60s and 70s, of course, Robert Welch was really anathema as far as the media is concerned.
[00:46:41.796 --> 00:46:45.621]  And, you know, my friends and neighbors all thought that I was crazy for even associating with the guy.
[00:46:45.641 --> 00:46:47.563]  Because they thought he was a kook.
[00:46:47.603 --> 00:46:52.008]  They weren't sure whether he was a fascist or a communist.
[00:46:52.769 --> 00:46:53.089]  Or what?
[00:46:53.149 --> 00:46:54.790]  An anti-Semite or a racist?
[00:46:54.830 --> 00:46:55.930]  They had all these words floating around.
[00:46:56.170 --> 00:46:57.110]  He was none of the above.
[00:46:57.171 --> 00:47:00.752]  He was a very intellectual person and a historian.
[00:47:00.772 --> 00:47:11.735]  He had a profound impact on awaking me to awareness of the continuity between what is going on today and what has been going on throughout history.
[00:47:12.095 --> 00:47:17.057]  And without that continuity, it's really hard to understand fully the essence of what's going on.
[00:47:17.237 --> 00:47:20.138]  Those are the two figures that had a profound effect on me.
[00:47:20.758 --> 00:47:24.459]  I like your analysis, though, because we all are just like pebbles in a pond.
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:32.602]  And if we can attract somebody's attention to the pond, and then they start throwing pebbles in, first thing you know, you've got more and more big waves.
[00:47:32.942 --> 00:47:42.385]  Or we could be an A-bomb with a uranium bullet, a plutonium bullet being fired into the uranium, and then you have that interaction, and it's going critical right now.
[00:47:42.405 --> 00:47:46.767]  I mean, I want to get more into the economy, but do you agree that this is the biggest
[00:47:48.027 --> 00:47:51.890]  You know, exponential growth of awakening from the Matrix to Liberty.
[00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:53.731]  I mean, it's just explosive.
[00:47:53.811 --> 00:47:55.132]  It's just unbelievable right now.
[00:47:55.152 --> 00:47:56.473]  Alex, there's no question about it.
[00:47:56.533 --> 00:48:03.699]  This is approaching critical mass, and that pulls my mind back to a topic we were on track with a moment ago.
[00:48:04.179 --> 00:48:08.520]  Which is what these guys are anticipating to happen down at the end of the line.
[00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:12.161]  We were talking about the economy at that time, so let me address that.
[00:48:12.181 --> 00:48:13.582]  Let's finish up with the economy.
[00:48:14.202 --> 00:48:17.323]  Because what they expect to see is a collapse of the U.S.
[00:48:17.383 --> 00:48:17.723]  dollar.
[00:48:17.763 --> 00:48:19.944]  They've been expecting that for decades.
[00:48:20.424 --> 00:48:30.207]  And so right now, they have unleashed Plan B, which is, you see, their long-range goal is to get rid of the sovereignty of this nation, to literally get rid of the United
[00:48:30.347 --> 00:48:35.589]  By the way, the Trilaterals in the 70s said they would first have, you know, three global currencies and then merge those.
[00:48:35.769 --> 00:48:38.550]  Yeah, so this is not a last minute plan.
[00:48:39.070 --> 00:48:44.611]  And so now that the dollar is tanking, they're prepared to come on in the near future and say, Aha!
[00:48:44.932 --> 00:48:46.632]  We have a solution for you folks.
[00:48:46.992 --> 00:48:48.353]  It'll be called the Amaro.
[00:48:48.393 --> 00:48:49.753]  It'll be a new currency.
[00:48:49.993 --> 00:48:59.480]  Dollarize the Americas, and together that will get our credit back up, and then things can start moving, and then as soon as we accept that, then they turn the credit back on, and we think, oh, they fixed it!
[00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:00.481]  They fixed it, yeah.
[00:49:00.721 --> 00:49:14.151]  So that will be a huge step to surrender our national sovereignty, so they will gain toward their ultimate goal, and we, if we're not careful, will be sold a bill of goods and be convinced that we've done a wonderful thing.
[00:49:14.671 --> 00:49:15.631]  So, that's the answer.
[00:49:15.671 --> 00:49:18.972]  They do have a plan for everything, and that's not the end of the line either.
[00:49:19.472 --> 00:49:31.075]  Once the Amaro or the regional currency is in place, then I would guess another 10, 15, 20 years perhaps, then finally they get rid of all of the regional currencies and merge them into a true international currency.
[00:49:31.375 --> 00:49:33.236]  And again, the process will be the same.
[00:49:33.536 --> 00:49:37.797]  The citizens of the world will be convinced that it was a step forward in their own best interest.
[00:49:38.177 --> 00:49:41.919]  Now the average person doesn't think in an institutional or long-term view.
[00:49:41.959 --> 00:49:43.140]  They don't even care about their neighbor.
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:43.821]  They've been taught to.
[00:49:43.841 --> 00:49:45.221]  They don't care about their kids, a lot of them.
[00:49:45.542 --> 00:49:49.204]  Or they consciously do, but really don't carry that out.
[00:49:49.644 --> 00:49:52.146]  And so they think, well how could something last that long?
[00:49:52.266 --> 00:49:54.507]  Why would they work for someone that came in the future?
[00:49:54.928 --> 00:49:56.649]  It's institutional family wealth.
[00:49:57.069 --> 00:50:00.451]  They sit over the institutions that give them personal wealth and power.
[00:50:00.991 --> 00:50:02.953]  It's in their best interest to always be expanding
[00:50:03.733 --> 00:50:04.154]  I think?
[00:50:21.813 --> 00:50:22.233]  All of this.
[00:50:22.273 --> 00:50:23.454]  They own the currencies now.
[00:50:23.534 --> 00:50:24.595]  They get power and control.
[00:50:24.915 --> 00:50:32.459]  It's just they're going to another phase where they've got total global control because there's still cracks in the facade where people can still escape.
[00:50:32.479 --> 00:50:33.640]  There's still black markets.
[00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:36.441]  This is a total scientific dictatorship.
[00:50:36.742 --> 00:50:38.162]  The total managed economy.
[00:50:38.543 --> 00:50:40.744]  The final revolution.
[00:50:41.584 --> 00:50:44.386]  The monopoly of power that they're going for.
[00:50:44.426 --> 00:50:45.827]  Can you break that down for people?
[00:50:46.107 --> 00:51:03.909]  Well, yes, again, you've said it so well, Alex, but my own take on it is that this process of collectivism, that's what we're talking about, this concentration of governmental and political and economic power in the hands of a few who are making the decision, supposedly in the name of the greater number,
[00:51:04.389 --> 00:51:08.934]  It's for your own good, for the good of society, is heady wine.
[00:51:09.695 --> 00:51:10.776]  Maybe that's the wrong analogy.
[00:51:10.816 --> 00:51:11.857]  It's like a pregnancy.
[00:51:12.377 --> 00:51:14.800]  Once it starts, it's got to go to full term.
[00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:25.310]  There's no case in history that a group of men who have pulled power over their fellow human beings, pulled it together, that they've ever stopped and said, well, this is enough.
[00:51:25.951 --> 00:51:26.691]  It's never happened.
[00:51:26.711 --> 00:51:28.772]  They always want more, more, and more.
[00:51:29.173 --> 00:51:32.014]  And so... Isn't this a guild of the ultimate control freaks?
[00:51:32.574 --> 00:51:33.354]  It is a guild.
[00:51:33.715 --> 00:51:38.897]  And the interesting thing is that they will vie with each other over control of that guild.
[00:51:38.917 --> 00:51:42.018]  So we have splinters within this movement today.
[00:51:42.459 --> 00:51:43.319]  Very important splinters.
[00:51:43.339 --> 00:51:44.379]  But it's like Russian dolls.
[00:51:44.439 --> 00:51:45.500]  It's within the greater structure.
[00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:46.360]  Yes, yes.
[00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:48.401]  But they will fight with each other for dominance.
[00:51:48.781 --> 00:51:50.061]  And maybe we can come back to that.
[00:51:50.081 --> 00:51:52.522]  And they even talk about that and say that's what gives them vigor.
[00:51:52.942 --> 00:51:53.022]  Yeah.
[00:51:53.042 --> 00:51:54.703]  Kind of like O'Brien torturing Winston.
[00:51:54.743 --> 00:51:56.183]  He says, they're probably going to kill me too.
[00:51:56.403 --> 00:51:57.124]  But that's good.
[00:51:57.384 --> 00:51:59.524]  Because, you know, you think I have black circles around my eyes.
[00:51:59.564 --> 00:52:05.386]  Well, you know, my unhealth, me being worn out is part of the greater health of the vigor.
[00:52:05.586 --> 00:52:06.707]  We're the priest of power.
[00:52:06.747 --> 00:52:08.327]  It's about pressing on the nerve, Winston.
[00:52:08.507 --> 00:52:13.769]  It's always more, more, tearing humans apart, tearing language, tearing art, reducing it for power!
[00:52:14.839 --> 00:52:15.100]  Yes!
[00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:19.524]  My gosh, that's well said!
[00:52:19.764 --> 00:52:21.086]  I know, and it's so true!
[00:52:21.926 --> 00:52:24.870]  It's power for its own sake, it takes on a life force of its own.
[00:52:25.470 --> 00:52:33.298]  And the point being, as I see it, that this process has never stopped short of total, once it starts.
[00:52:33.578 --> 00:52:35.821]  So, do we learn anything from that?
[00:52:36.381 --> 00:52:37.681]  The question is yes.
[00:52:37.721 --> 00:52:44.022]  I think we can learn that the process that we're dealing with now is not going to stop of its own accord.
[00:52:44.362 --> 00:52:55.885]  If we just sit back and say, well, maybe these people are going to come to their senses, or maybe if we write a letter to our congressmen, or maybe if we sign a petition asking that they obey the Constitution, maybe we can stop this power.
[00:52:56.165 --> 00:52:56.385]  No.
[00:52:56.745 --> 00:53:00.525]  We've got to confront that power with equal or greater power.
[00:53:00.885 --> 00:53:03.726]  And this is the part that many people do not want to face.
[00:53:04.046 --> 00:53:06.310]  Let's do solutions, because Horowitz is coming up briefly.
[00:53:06.711 --> 00:53:18.190]  Let's just do solutions now and then get into how Barack Obama, it's all a distraction, you know that short-term thing, they get us diverted and distracted, that theatrical simulation of an election.
[00:53:19.946 --> 00:53:22.587]  Yeah, that's a great topic too, but I think you're quite right.
[00:53:22.967 --> 00:53:29.208]  The thing that we need to take away from any discussion like this is, what the heck are we going to do about it?
[00:53:29.968 --> 00:53:33.389]  And I come back to the word power that I used a moment ago.
[00:53:34.149 --> 00:53:43.991]  The thing that the forces of freedom have been missing, at least in the United States, in the period of time in which I've been aware of it, I've been a part of this movement since 1959-1960,
[00:53:46.411 --> 00:53:54.734]  The one thing that has been missing from this movement all these years is the understanding and the awareness that we have to have power.
[00:53:55.415 --> 00:54:01.997]  I remember for years standing in front of audiences and saying, well, the concentration of power is very dangerous and that's the problem.
[00:54:02.357 --> 00:54:04.498]  All these people are getting too much power over us.
[00:54:04.738 --> 00:54:06.519]  Now, we ourselves must not have power.
[00:54:06.839 --> 00:54:12.902]  We must take the power away from them somehow, but we ourselves must reject power because that's the problem.
[00:54:12.922 --> 00:54:13.722]  No, we need power!
[00:54:14.142 --> 00:54:17.884]  Yes, but you see, that's the part that I was missing, and many people have missed.
[00:54:18.264 --> 00:54:24.527]  And then one morning I woke up... We only need power to tear down their structures, and then to guard against the structures being rebuilt.
[00:54:24.647 --> 00:54:26.008]  But that is power nevertheless.
[00:54:26.168 --> 00:54:28.989]  Yes, well it's dangerous, but see, that's where the anarchists are wrong.
[00:54:29.009 --> 00:54:32.211]  You've got to have some state to defend against the state.
[00:54:32.751 --> 00:54:33.572]  It is dangerous.
[00:54:33.792 --> 00:54:36.634]  But you've got to be eternally vigilant and guard the jewel.
[00:54:36.975 --> 00:54:38.095]  Well, you're right on target.
[00:54:38.135 --> 00:54:40.557]  You see, it took me much longer to figure this out.
[00:54:40.838 --> 00:54:45.221]  I woke up one morning and said, oh, as long as we say that we must not have power, we lose.
[00:54:45.321 --> 00:54:46.622]  We are going to lose.
[00:54:46.942 --> 00:54:50.205]  And so then the next step was, well, how can we... Well, when I own a gun, I have power.
[00:54:50.225 --> 00:54:51.786]  When I can own private property, I have power.
[00:54:52.027 --> 00:54:52.467]  Exactly.
[00:54:52.487 --> 00:54:57.491]  And I need power not to have baubles and trinkets and signets of power, but to defend myself.
[00:54:57.871 --> 00:54:58.291]  Exactly.
[00:54:58.351 --> 00:55:01.692]  I like that analogy because guns are dangerous, are they not?
[00:55:02.153 --> 00:55:02.793]  Very dangerous.
[00:55:02.833 --> 00:55:04.613]  People get hurt with guns, get killed with guns.
[00:55:04.914 --> 00:55:07.835]  The only thing more dangerous is not having them when you need them.
[00:55:08.035 --> 00:55:09.495]  I got one right here, G. Eber-Griffin.
[00:55:09.675 --> 00:55:13.597]  And it's not because I'm some gun nut, it's because if some crazy comes in here, I'm going to defend myself.
[00:55:13.617 --> 00:55:15.617]  Yeah, you don't want to make a 9-11 call.
[00:55:15.717 --> 00:55:20.059]  And so it's the power over not coming home to my family.
[00:55:20.439 --> 00:55:20.659]  Right.
[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:22.040]  So that's the analogy.
[00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:24.802]  We do need power to protect ourselves.
[00:55:25.323 --> 00:55:36.191]  And so in this political arena, in the ideological arena, the reason we have been losing our liberties is because these crazies, these collectivists, these totalitarians who have a different vision for the new world.
[00:55:36.211 --> 00:55:36.972]  They crave it, they want it.
[00:55:37.112 --> 00:55:37.832]  And they have it.
[00:55:38.513 --> 00:55:39.253]  They have it.
[00:55:39.313 --> 00:55:43.577]  They have spent a hundred years moving into the power centers of society.
[00:55:43.597 --> 00:55:45.238]  And now these freaks are going to kill 90% of us.
[00:55:45.538 --> 00:55:46.438]  Stay there, G. Edward Griffin.
[00:55:46.458 --> 00:55:48.759]  We're going to be right back after this break.
[00:55:48.779 --> 00:55:49.760]  This is just unbelievable.
[00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:51.600]  We'll go over the past three if it's okay.
[00:55:51.841 --> 00:55:53.961]  But you can take a break right now for four minutes, okay?
[00:55:54.301 --> 00:55:55.302]  We'll be right back, folks.
[00:56:02.085 --> 00:56:03.485]  It is a big idea.
[00:56:03.505 --> 00:56:05.606]  A new world order.
[00:56:06.326 --> 00:56:10.648]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:56:11.218 --> 00:56:12.959]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[00:56:13.179 --> 00:56:16.240]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:19.281]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:56:20.021 --> 00:56:27.323]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:56:30.359 --> 00:56:35.342]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:56:35.803 --> 00:56:39.265]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:56:39.685 --> 00:56:42.147]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:56:42.247 --> 00:56:43.208]  Most people have no idea.
[00:56:43.228 --> 00:56:44.168]  They're not after money.
[00:56:44.188 --> 00:56:45.269]  They have all the money they need.
[00:56:45.469 --> 00:56:46.070]  They're after power.
[00:56:46.090 --> 00:56:47.130]  That's what they're after these days.

[00:56:59.118 --> 00:57:00.199]  You have been warned.
[00:57:01.059 --> 00:57:08.983]  If your body isn't feeling too well these days, you're gonna start taking this hemp I say, go to hempusa.org.
[00:57:11.064 --> 00:57:15.527]  You may not like what I'm about to say, but you know I'm gonna say it anyway.
[00:57:15.547 --> 00:57:23.611]  The government doesn't want the best for you, they keep you down, they keep you blue, they starve your body for all its nutrients.
[00:57:25.655 --> 00:57:27.756]  They won't let you grow industrial hemp.
[00:57:28.116 --> 00:57:33.499]  It really doesn't make any kind of sense when it's so healthy for the world and useful for you, my friends.
[00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:39.943]  I hope Mr. Bush will hear this song, for the heart of America wants this one.
[00:57:39.983 --> 00:57:43.045]  Go to hempusa.org.
[00:57:44.826 --> 00:57:49.728]  If you're a truther, an anarchist, a renegade, you only want things that God has made.

[00:58:14.223 --> 00:58:18.026]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[00:58:18.386 --> 00:58:24.889]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:58:25.269 --> 00:58:28.430]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:58:28.670 --> 00:58:36.174]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:59:00.768 --> 00:59:05.909]  The Federal Trade Commission estimates that 9 million Americans are victims of identity theft each year.
[00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:10.870]  The crime of identity theft occurs every 3.5 seconds, costing the victims an average of $8,000.

[01:00:09.324 --> 01:00:19.533]  Gilbert Griffin is our guest in studio.
[01:00:38.237 --> 01:00:44.865]  We're going to get a break here in just a few minutes and Dr. Len Horowitz is going to be popping in for about five minutes with us.
[01:00:45.286 --> 01:00:46.367]  Mr. Griffin is going to stay with us.
[01:00:46.387 --> 01:00:49.251]  Continuing with Solutions, Freedom Force International, sir.
[01:00:51.445 --> 01:00:52.065]  That's my cue?
[01:00:52.506 --> 01:00:52.746]  Yes, sir.
[01:00:52.886 --> 01:00:53.286]  Okay.
[01:00:53.746 --> 01:00:56.748]  Well, we were talking about power, and the danger of power.
[01:00:57.468 --> 01:01:05.872]  And the good analogy was made that guns are dangerous, and that people get hurt with guns, but the only thing more dangerous is not having them when you need them.
[01:01:06.433 --> 01:01:06.713]  Okay.
[01:01:07.033 --> 01:01:08.654]  Now we deal with political power.
[01:01:09.134 --> 01:01:09.874]  It's dangerous.
[01:01:10.515 --> 01:01:14.397]  Everybody knows Lord Acton's well-known quote.
[01:01:15.077 --> 01:01:20.740]  Acton said, power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:26.984]  And so that was the cue I had years ago to say, well, if power corrupts, therefore we shouldn't have power.
[01:01:27.504 --> 01:01:30.546]  And then I realized that if you don't have power, you lose.
[01:01:30.966 --> 01:01:41.894]  So the question then became, is it possible for a movement such as ours to reach for power, political power, and yet design it in such a way that it cannot be corrupted?
[01:01:42.694 --> 01:01:44.054]  By the power.
[01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:46.015]  And the answer is yes, it can be done.
[01:01:46.075 --> 01:01:47.095]  It's just never been tried.
[01:01:47.355 --> 01:01:48.035]  Well, that's not true.
[01:01:48.055 --> 01:01:50.355]  It was tried in the case of the American Revolution.
[01:01:50.375 --> 01:01:58.057]  Well, that's what the founders tried, and it did separate power for a while, and it did limit it enough for at least some freedom to take place, and it was the greatest engine ever.
[01:01:58.197 --> 01:01:59.577]  It was a great experiment.
[01:01:59.637 --> 01:02:07.579]  It was the first step ever in history where people consciously tried to write a document that would limit the power of their own political leaders.
[01:02:07.739 --> 01:02:09.759]  And 5% of the population got half the world's wealth.
[01:02:10.444 --> 01:02:10.624]  Yeah.
[01:02:10.904 --> 01:02:11.724]  It didn't work, did it?
[01:02:11.744 --> 01:02:14.705]  Well, it's not surprising, because it was a beta model.
[01:02:15.205 --> 01:02:19.946]  We are going to come to the time soon, I think, Alex, where we're going to have a chance to rework that model.
[01:02:20.226 --> 01:02:23.467]  Now we go to the second model, and we will have learned a lot in the process.
[01:02:24.027 --> 01:02:29.248]  The question is, how can you limit people with political power from being corrupted by it?
[01:02:29.628 --> 01:02:36.210]  And the answer, I believe, is to have a well-thought-out definition of what the purpose of government is.
[01:02:37.090 --> 01:02:56.383]  And if we limit the power of government, as we did to some extent with the Bill of Rights, in our own Constitution, say that Congress shall not have the power to do this, this, and this, and then put teeth into it, we can keep our elected leaders from being corrupted by power, because they won't be given the power in the first place.
[01:02:56.703 --> 01:02:57.464]  That's the solution.
[01:02:57.684 --> 01:02:58.685]  Don't give them the power.
[01:02:59.245 --> 01:03:00.786]  So, that's my answer to it.
[01:03:00.806 --> 01:03:04.549]  And that's the reason that with Freedom Force International,
[01:03:05.690 --> 01:03:10.354]  First thing we did was to introduce what we call the Creed of Freedom.
[01:03:11.175 --> 01:03:18.501]  And the Creed of Freedom is the statement of principles, positive principles, that all members adhere to.
[01:03:18.982 --> 01:03:28.471]  And if all of our members and all of our elected representatives adhered to the principles of the Creed of Freedom, then there would be no way for power to corrupt those individuals.
[01:03:29.452 --> 01:03:31.174]  And to be clear, nothing's ever going to be perfect.
[01:03:31.194 --> 01:03:36.922]  We're striving towards more liberty, towards more freedom, instead of racing at light speed towards total tyranny.
[01:03:37.143 --> 01:03:38.645]  Don't expect it to be perfect, no.
[01:03:39.005 --> 01:03:40.267]  Human nature isn't perfect.
[01:03:41.108 --> 01:03:44.713]  But we can be a lot closer to the goal than we are now, that's for sure.
[01:03:45.919 --> 01:03:47.680]  Talk more about Freedom Force International.
[01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:56.384]  Well, the whole purpose of Freedom Force was to do basically what I've been talking about, and that is to help our members to acquire power.
[01:03:56.964 --> 01:04:01.226]  We know that without power, we cannot achieve any political reform.
[01:04:01.766 --> 01:04:04.047]  In fact, the motto of Freedom Force is this.
[01:04:04.187 --> 01:04:09.710]  In English, it's, those without power cannot defend freedom.
[01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:11.571]  And there it is in a nutshell.
[01:04:11.871 --> 01:04:15.333]  We've got to quit being on the outside of the halls of power.
[01:04:15.693 --> 01:04:20.936]  Looking in, saying, oh please, those of you who make political decisions, won't you please listen to us?
[01:04:21.176 --> 01:04:21.796]  Won't you please?
[01:04:21.996 --> 01:04:24.058]  Well, I've said we've even got to infiltrate.
[01:04:24.078 --> 01:04:31.682]  That doesn't mean being dishonest, but be covert, act like mainline conservatives, get into power, and then really leak info.
[01:04:32.042 --> 01:04:41.289]  I mean at the city council, send people to jail, find the crud, hire P.I.s to follow corrupt mayors, you're going to catch them, put the video of them cheating on their wife on the web.
[01:04:41.309 --> 01:04:43.471]  I mean, I've told people to go ahead and get mean.
[01:04:44.072 --> 01:04:49.196]  Well, getting mean, that's not infiltrating, that's doing your obligation.
[01:04:49.496 --> 01:04:52.959]  You go into political office because you want to serve the nation or the city.
[01:04:52.979 --> 01:04:53.359]  No, I do.
[01:04:53.399 --> 01:04:54.400]  I want to bring down these people.
[01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:55.821]  Yeah, bring down the corrupt ones.
[01:04:56.521 --> 01:04:59.802]  But that doesn't necessarily mean that that's your primary motive.
[01:05:00.162 --> 01:05:06.405]  I think people should go into political office who want to serve their community, not because... But you serve by getting the corrupt people off the ground.
[01:05:06.425 --> 01:05:08.346]  You've got to do that first, obviously, yeah.
[01:05:08.766 --> 01:05:10.487]  So that's the nutshell.
[01:05:10.927 --> 01:05:13.788]  We have members now, Alex, in 58 countries.
[01:05:13.808 --> 01:05:15.869]  It just blows me away, I can't believe that.
[01:05:16.249 --> 01:05:18.010]  Because I find out that there are people in
[01:05:18.670 --> 01:05:20.992]  All over the world that have basically the same problem.
[01:05:21.632 --> 01:05:22.954]  And it's growing.
[01:05:23.314 --> 01:05:24.875]  I tell you what, stay there, stay there.
[01:05:25.235 --> 01:05:31.340]  We're going to come back and talk, shift gears about their bioweapons programs against us, which I know you've covered, and the whole eugenics agenda.
[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.202]  We're going to talk to Len Horowitz in about five minutes.
[01:05:33.462 --> 01:05:35.624]  Then we're going to continue going back into solutions.
[01:05:35.964 --> 01:05:42.329]  I want to spend a lot of time on that and then maybe a few calls, maybe go ten minutes into the next hour and take a few calls as well.
[01:05:43.009 --> 01:05:43.890]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:05:44.030 --> 01:05:44.691]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:51.937 --> 01:05:54.921]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:05:55.862 --> 01:05:58.525]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:06.322]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:06:06.562 --> 01:06:11.464]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.

[01:06:45.313 --> 01:06:48.813]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[01:07:11.627 --> 01:07:13.228]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[01:07:13.528 --> 01:07:14.589]  And I say big time.

[01:08:33.954 --> 01:08:38.816]  You can trace every disease, every illness, and every ailment to mineral deficiency.
[01:08:39.036 --> 01:08:42.758]  That is a quote from two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling.
[01:08:42.918 --> 01:08:52.444]  Because fruits and vegetables in their raw form are better absorbed, retained, and utilized than if heated, the Champion Juicer is the best way to get your nutrients your body craves.
[01:08:52.604 --> 01:08:56.806]  The Champion Juicer chews the fibers and breaks up the cells of vegetables and fruits.
[01:08:56.986 --> 01:09:00.669]  This gives you more fiber, enzymes, vitamins, and trace minerals.
[01:09:00.849 --> 01:09:10.435]  Juicing a combination of raw fruits and vegetables is documented to not only treat... Back live to Clint Horowitz popping in for 10 minutes with us with G. Edward Griffin.
[01:09:11.375 --> 01:09:14.156]  Continuing with solutions in the fight against the New World Order.
[01:09:15.336 --> 01:09:18.037]  We've got Dr. Horowitz coming on for a full hour tomorrow.
[01:09:18.077 --> 01:09:25.520]  I appreciate him and his very busy schedule with his clinic and books and films and all the prolific work he's doing coming on on such short notice.
[01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:29.161]  But this is why we've got him on and tomorrow he's going to document this for everybody.
[01:09:29.181 --> 01:09:32.082]  I know a lot of you know this but your friends, family, neighbors don't.
[01:09:32.422 --> 01:09:34.102]  Tell them to tune in tomorrow for the full hour.
[01:09:34.522 --> 01:09:36.563]  Tell them to go to inlieswetrust.com.
[01:09:36.963 --> 01:09:38.444]  We have a story we wrote today
[01:09:39.424 --> 01:09:42.287]  Up on PrisonPlanet.com, Wright says U.S.
[01:09:42.307 --> 01:09:44.230]  government capable of creating AIDS virus.
[01:09:44.610 --> 01:09:49.756]  Hecklers turn mute after pastor cites documented history of biological warfare against innocent people.
[01:09:50.156 --> 01:09:54.241]  And man, Dr. Horowitz has been kind enough to put his film up for free on Google Video, though he recommends you get
[01:09:54.361 --> 01:10:03.829]  I've watched it, it's just amazing, documenting all the admissions of how they're killing it, much like my film Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement does.
[01:10:04.069 --> 01:10:06.992]  So let's play this minute and a half of Reverend Wright at the Press Club.
[01:10:07.272 --> 01:10:15.459]  This is big news as they attack Reverend Wright all over neocon, fake conservative radio, liberal TV, saying he's completely nuts, the government.
[01:10:15.939 --> 01:10:18.420]  It's never marched our troops into chambers in Nerve Gaston.
[01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:21.521]  It never let black men die without treatment for 50 years of syphilis.
[01:10:21.901 --> 01:10:23.701]  It never radiated little children.
[01:10:24.161 --> 01:10:25.182]  The government loves you!
[01:10:25.642 --> 01:10:26.442]  Here's Reverend Wright.
[01:10:26.982 --> 01:10:34.324]  In your sermon, you said the government lied about inventing the HIV virus as a means of genocide against people of color.
[01:10:34.625 --> 01:10:37.986]  So I ask you, do you honestly believe your statement and those words?
[01:10:39.206 --> 01:10:42.747]  Have you read Horowitz's book, Emerging Viruses, AIDS and Ebola?
[01:10:44.130 --> 01:10:45.070]  Whoever wrote that question?
[01:10:45.670 --> 01:10:47.071]  Have you read Medical Apartheid?
[01:10:47.291 --> 01:10:47.711]  You've read it?
[01:10:54.373 --> 01:10:55.453]  No questions from the floor.
[01:10:56.253 --> 01:10:57.334]  I read different things.
[01:10:57.414 --> 01:11:10.217]  As I said to my members, if you haven't read things and you can't... Based on this Tuskegee experiment and based on what has happened to Africans in this country, I believe our government is capable of doing anything.
[01:11:10.257 --> 01:11:11.978]  In fact, in fact, in fact,
[01:11:13.593 --> 01:11:25.661]  One of the responses to what Saddam Hussein had in terms of biological warfare was a non-question because all we had to do was check the sales records.
[01:11:25.701 --> 01:11:30.604]  We sold him those biological weapons that he was using against his own people.
[01:11:30.664 --> 01:11:40.090]  So any time a government can put together biological warfare to kill people and then get angry when those people use what we sold them, yes, I believe we are capable.
[01:11:41.909 --> 01:11:48.710]  And again, for a full hour tomorrow, we're going to have Dr. Len Horowitz on, just on this particular subject, but there it is being cited.
[01:11:48.770 --> 01:11:56.752]  It's all over national television, which is going to backfire on them because they're going to find his film, they're going to find his best-selling book, they're going to find out.
[01:11:56.772 --> 01:12:02.313]  And by the way, I didn't just believe Horowitz and others when I discovered all this 12 years ago, though I found him to be very accurate.
[01:12:02.333 --> 01:12:06.654]  I went out and looked it up myself and found out that it's a haul of horrors.
[01:12:06.734 --> 01:12:08.334]  It just never seems to end.
[01:12:08.835 --> 01:12:10.855]  Dr. Horowitz, thanks for coming on on short notice.
[01:12:11.255 --> 01:12:17.299]  Your take on this firestorm nationally, right now, being triggered by Reverend Wright reading your book and others.
[01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:25.305]  Well, it's obvious that the mainstream media is really completely taking everybody away from the most important thing, is the genocide.
[01:12:26.006 --> 01:12:28.487]  I know you've been telling people that, and I've been saying that.
[01:12:29.108 --> 01:12:31.129]  G. Edward Griffin has been saying that, many others.
[01:12:31.650 --> 01:12:36.213]  And the fact that he could make such a statement, he could cite the scientific evidence,
[01:12:36.873 --> 01:12:57.479]  Uh, the book Emerging Viruses, the documentation we have on the website in originofaids.com, the movie as you mentioned that's freely downloadable in Lives We Trust showing the documents that shows the United States Federal Government created numerous AIDS-like and Ebola-like viruses, let them out, virtually with Henry Kissinger's directive
[01:12:57.979 --> 01:12:58.540]  We're good to go.
[01:13:19.217 --> 01:13:19.958]  Absolutely.
[01:13:20.038 --> 01:13:24.900]  Slam-dunk evidence proves that this was what triggered the international AIDS pandemic.
[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:36.005]  Now for the media to not be focusing on that, millions of people dying, and they're going to go right along, play the same old, same old political nonsense games that they're playing.
[01:13:36.386 --> 01:13:38.787]  This is genocide, and it's got to stop.
[01:13:38.967 --> 01:13:42.829]  And even Al Sharpton's criticizing Wright for talking about Tuskegee.
[01:13:42.929 --> 01:13:44.670]  I mean, they just deny all this.
[01:13:45.930 --> 01:13:46.611]  To their faces.
[01:13:46.651 --> 01:13:50.373]  But I guess Margaret Sanger went and hired W.E.B.
[01:13:50.393 --> 01:13:55.195]  Du Bois and others to go, as he said, we can't let the blacks know we want to exterminate them.
[01:13:55.215 --> 01:13:56.376]  By the way, that's an exact quote.
[01:13:56.896 --> 01:14:00.618]  So we've, you know, the head of the Soap Foundation was at Colgate.
[01:14:01.279 --> 01:14:03.880]  He's giving me money to go hire the blacks as our fronts.
[01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:05.561]  And I just think it's shameful.
[01:14:06.947 --> 01:14:08.828]  Disgustingly, it makes you nauseous.
[01:14:09.329 --> 01:14:19.197]  And the fact that they have black men and women who could watch their own people and millions of others of various races die without actually benefiting.
[01:14:19.337 --> 01:14:27.804]  Not necessarily just keeping their mouth shut, but actually being part of the conspiracy of silence that is literally allowing this genocide to continue.
[01:14:28.504 --> 01:14:29.725]  This is despicable.
[01:14:30.326 --> 01:14:31.567]  It is beyond human.
[01:14:31.987 --> 01:14:35.070]  It is alien to any kind of loving
[01:14:36.763 --> 01:14:40.586]  But they claim it justifies the means for the greater good of the earth and the elite.
[01:14:40.646 --> 01:14:41.987]  Gilbert Griffin, your take on this.
[01:14:42.308 --> 01:14:46.010]  Well yeah, that's how they justify all of these insane programs.
[01:14:46.091 --> 01:14:48.472]  And so we have to sacrifice a few people along the way.
[01:14:48.492 --> 01:14:50.894]  A few hundred thousand people or a few million people.
[01:14:51.214 --> 01:14:53.416]  Look at the great benefit that comes out of this.
[01:14:53.776 --> 01:14:55.878]  You know, we've got population control now.
[01:14:56.198 --> 01:14:59.501]  So it's in the long run they claim that they're quite humanitarian.
[01:14:59.961 --> 01:15:01.564]  InLiesWeTrust.com.
[01:15:01.584 --> 01:15:08.036]  Dr. Horowitz is on for a full hour tomorrow with us to really break down the documents and go through this and talk about his new film.
[01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:10.200]  Dr. Horowitz, we'll talk to you tomorrow.
[01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:11.943]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[01:15:12.478 --> 01:15:12.798]  Pleasure.
[01:15:12.919 --> 01:15:13.379]  Thanks guys.
[01:15:13.559 --> 01:15:13.759]  Bye.
[01:15:13.799 --> 01:15:14.480]  We'll see you tomorrow.
[01:15:30.416 --> 01:15:39.786]  There's hundreds of them to use, but one of the prominent biology professors at the University of Texas here in Austin, Dr. Pianca, two years ago, came out and gave a speech at the Texas Academy of Sciences.
[01:15:40.066 --> 01:15:42.909]  He's gotten awards in Europe from prestigious universities.
[01:15:43.329 --> 01:15:44.490]  He said, we need to kill 90%.
[01:15:45.211 --> 01:15:46.913]  I can't wait until Ebola gets airborne.
[01:15:48.174 --> 01:15:50.676]  And he showed a PowerPoint of skulls.
[01:15:51.357 --> 01:15:57.561]  And he dresses, on his own website, on the UT website, he dresses as a druid and talks about how he loves Lucifer.
[01:15:57.581 --> 01:15:59.322]  I mean, you can't make this stuff up.
[01:15:59.362 --> 01:16:03.044]  I mean, these people are just totally insane, but they've got power.
[01:16:03.404 --> 01:16:10.208]  But the news is that two different papers reported what shocked scientists in attendance was 95% standing ovation.
[01:16:10.869 --> 01:16:12.190]  Not at the end, but repeatedly.
[01:16:12.890 --> 01:16:22.195]  When he said that everyone needs to die, and then I had his graduate students, and I tracked who they were, I'd Google their name afterwards, and they'd say, here's my online, you know, this is why I got a doctorate in.
[01:16:22.715 --> 01:16:41.004]  They'd be running, you know, bio laboratories and level three weapons labs, and you know, you'd go, my God, it'd be young women, men, and they're like, he is not extreme enough, we are for total death of the humans, the human is a scourge, and I mean, and it's like, we will soon deal with all of you, and they're in the bio weapons labs,
[01:16:41.684 --> 01:16:46.765]  And they're sending me threatening letters with their name, and then I post their pictures saying, look at this person.
[01:16:47.065 --> 01:16:49.286]  They gave me, and they freak out on me and threaten me.
[01:16:49.306 --> 01:16:53.827]  I mean, because in their own little bubble, it's all kill, kill everyone.
[01:16:54.127 --> 01:16:55.407]  Death is wonderful.
[01:16:55.667 --> 01:16:57.368]  I mean, I don't think listeners can understand.
[01:16:57.408 --> 01:16:58.448]  I'm not joking.
[01:16:58.948 --> 01:17:00.548]  These people are dangerous.
[01:17:00.928 --> 01:17:01.769]  They're everywhere.
[01:17:02.309 --> 01:17:05.569]  G. Everett Griffin, can you talk about the large, you know, population reduction program?
[01:17:05.589 --> 01:17:07.610]  Ted Turner, Prince Philip, all these statements.
[01:17:08.030 --> 01:17:14.095]  Yeah, well, it always comes back to that issue of the greater good for the greater number, and people might say, well, how can that be?
[01:17:14.335 --> 01:17:20.220]  If they're planning to get rid of 80-90% of the population, that's the greater number right there.
[01:17:20.601 --> 01:17:25.405]  Well, what they miss is that it's not really the greater number, the issue is the greater good.
[01:17:26.325 --> 01:17:29.508]  And it's the greater good of the elite!
[01:17:29.768 --> 01:17:33.271]  They have to survive as guardians, because they have the great vision!
[01:17:33.791 --> 01:17:38.435]  And they also have the vision of preserving the ecology of the planet.
[01:17:38.475 --> 01:17:42.978]  You see, our environment is in danger, so now we get rid of 90%... We can't wait until we kill these humans!
[01:17:43.438 --> 01:17:48.521]  Yeah, because they'd like to make it seem like the humans are the ones endangering the environment.
[01:17:48.722 --> 01:17:52.064]  So now, you see, the greater good is to preserve planet Earth.
[01:17:52.544 --> 01:17:56.927]  And if we have to get rid of human beings, then that is a humanitarian... But it's beautiful!
[01:17:56.967 --> 01:18:03.010]  In fact, he was interviewed by TV and newspaper, and he said, I know my family needs to die first.
[01:18:03.591 --> 01:18:05.412]  It's very sad, but it's also beautiful.
[01:18:05.432 --> 01:18:07.113]  We're all going to be dead soon.
[01:18:07.933 --> 01:18:09.114]  You'll see soon!
[01:18:09.434 --> 01:18:11.416]  And meanwhile, you find out they cooked up Ebola.
[01:18:12.256 --> 01:18:14.978]  I mean, my God, these people need to all be arrested immediately!
[01:18:15.078 --> 01:18:19.541]  You talk about power, we need the power to gross them and get up and stand up against them!
[01:18:19.561 --> 01:18:20.642]  Yeah, it's incredible.
[01:18:20.862 --> 01:18:23.544]  The most incredible part is the applause that these people get.
[01:18:23.964 --> 01:18:35.132]  And the only reason they get the applause and the endorsement is because the audience is so tuned, so focused on saving the planet against human effect on the planet.
[01:18:35.172 --> 01:18:39.695]  It's horrible to say we have to kill 355,000 people a day, but it's even more horrible not to say it.
[01:18:39.735 --> 01:18:40.976]  Yeah, thank you, Jacques Cousteau.
[01:18:41.716 --> 01:18:42.177]  Yeah.
[01:18:42.878 --> 01:18:47.664]  Well, I want to tell all this scum, I want to see them all hanging themselves, slitting their own throats.
[01:18:48.024 --> 01:18:49.266]  I want to see them jumping off cliffs.
[01:18:49.346 --> 01:18:50.327]  Not me and my family.
[01:18:50.648 --> 01:18:52.811]  Listen you bastards, you're not going to kill me without a fight.
[01:18:53.837 --> 01:18:54.457]  Well, amen.
[01:18:54.597 --> 01:18:55.038]  I love that.
[01:18:55.058 --> 01:18:55.958]  Let's talk about power.
[01:18:55.978 --> 01:18:56.838]  How do we get power?
[01:18:57.178 --> 01:18:59.059]  Well, we get power the same way we lost it.
[01:18:59.479 --> 01:19:08.923]  And the way we lost it in this country, let's talk about that, is not because somebody showed up on our shores with uniforms and weapons in their hand and invaded us.
[01:19:09.464 --> 01:19:18.608]  It's because they crept into our universities and into our media centers and they crept into our think tanks and they crept into our government agencies.
[01:19:19.648 --> 01:19:20.328]  I think so.
[01:19:38.655 --> 01:19:43.477]  But then you get a little more subtle, and you realize that, well, those are media organizations as well.
[01:19:43.857 --> 01:19:47.218]  Networks, publications, book publishers, and so forth.
[01:19:47.678 --> 01:19:53.381]  And then the educational universities, the school systems, even at your local state level.
[01:19:53.581 --> 01:19:59.663]  You look at the people who are sitting on the boards of directors, and the controlling power within all of these groups.
[01:20:00.243 --> 01:20:04.625]  Nine chances out of ten, you're going to find people who have this collectivist mentality.
[01:20:04.885 --> 01:20:07.506]  Now, it didn't just happen with a flip of the coin.
[01:20:07.546 --> 01:20:08.707]  This was not accidental.
[01:20:08.947 --> 01:20:10.167]  This was not a random thing.
[01:20:10.627 --> 01:20:19.251]  People who believe in this concept know instinctively that they must acquire power over us to force their views on us
[01:20:19.631 --> 01:20:20.411]  Against our will.
[01:20:20.752 --> 01:20:24.713]  And they know that the agency or the engine of force is government.
[01:20:25.133 --> 01:20:26.254]  And that's where they go.
[01:20:26.794 --> 01:20:27.575]  That's how it happened.
[01:20:27.595 --> 01:20:34.197]  We lost our freedoms and we lost control because the agencies of power have been conquered quietly from the inside.
[01:20:34.277 --> 01:20:36.218]  And now they know and they project it.
[01:20:36.238 --> 01:20:37.379]  I mean, they're very sophisticated.
[01:20:37.859 --> 01:20:40.302]  They know that they can carry out eugenics programs.
[01:20:40.462 --> 01:20:41.984]  It comes out they're killing people.
[01:20:42.264 --> 01:20:44.968]  Then they make it a black-white thing, though it's really against everybody.
[01:20:45.428 --> 01:20:48.392]  It's just more of a soft kill in the Western world because they don't want to get caught.
[01:20:48.752 --> 01:20:52.256]  They can do a little bit of the harder kills in Africa and Asia where they can cover it up better.
[01:20:52.276 --> 01:20:55.680]  The UN shows up, gives all the pregnant women shots with the police because they've been paid.
[01:20:56.361 --> 01:20:58.682]  They all have miscarriages and then they can't have babies anymore.
[01:20:58.702 --> 01:20:59.382]  That's all admitted.
[01:20:59.562 --> 01:21:00.543]  Then they test the vaccine.
[01:21:00.563 --> 01:21:06.765]  It's got a very expensive synthetic hormone added that sterilizes them because it was added to the pathogen of the tetanus.
[01:21:07.065 --> 01:21:10.186]  I mean, they do this and the cop just knows he's been given some money.
[01:21:10.826 --> 01:21:15.068]  You know, the local mayor just, you know, it's poor villagers who can't fight back.
[01:21:16.128 --> 01:21:20.570]  You know, we need to break through the compartmentalization and show their minions what they're part of.
[01:21:20.850 --> 01:21:34.616]  So how do we deal with not just taking power, and I want to hear your ideas of getting that power back, and then dismantling their system, and building bulwarks against its re-emergence, but how do we, they foresaw us fighting back when they really started the squeeze.
[01:21:35.057 --> 01:21:42.440]  They tried to handcuff us down before they sucked us dry like a spider gets us tied up first, but they know some of us aren't completely tied up, so they've
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:44.583]  Well, boy, there's so many issues there, Alex.
[01:21:44.603 --> 01:21:47.186]  I don't know that I have the answer to all of them, or even many of them.
[01:21:59.961 --> 01:22:02.663]  There is an answer to that question in general.
[01:22:03.183 --> 01:22:07.585]  The first step, as mentioned earlier, is to get more people into our ranks.
[01:22:07.866 --> 01:22:10.207]  We cannot do it with the numbers we now have.
[01:22:10.507 --> 01:22:15.670]  So, this business of educating and spreading the word still has a great deal of value.
[01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:22.652]  But then, after that point, and even now, while we're doing that, we've got to mobilize these people to network with each other.
[01:22:22.772 --> 01:22:27.973]  And my solution is that they have to help each other get into these power centers of society.
[01:22:28.473 --> 01:22:29.894]  They have to run for office.
[01:22:29.934 --> 01:22:32.234]  They have to develop ways and means of raising money.
[01:22:32.254 --> 01:22:37.136]  Is it immoral to be covert about what you plan to do in government?
[01:22:37.436 --> 01:22:38.396]  See, that's what they did.
[01:22:39.176 --> 01:22:40.177]  And so this is a war.
[01:22:40.337 --> 01:22:43.239]  Do we have some of our people go underground?
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:48.283]  Some of our people not associate with us and covertly operate as sleepers?
[01:22:48.443 --> 01:22:50.765]  And the government's already warning of that for decades.
[01:22:50.785 --> 01:22:52.026]  They've already foreseen that threat.
[01:22:52.366 --> 01:22:56.629]  And then not to do illegal things, but to expose all their criminality once we get into power positions.
[01:22:56.909 --> 01:23:00.892]  Or is there a danger of being co-opted and selling out if you get in that nest?
[01:23:01.853 --> 01:23:06.195]  My answer to that is that you don't even need to deal with the ethical question.
[01:23:06.235 --> 01:23:07.815]  Well, the electronic voting machines cheat.
[01:23:07.875 --> 01:23:09.776]  It's almost like you've got to cheat to get in there.
[01:23:10.056 --> 01:23:10.636]  Start cheating.
[01:23:11.237 --> 01:23:16.239]  My answer to that is it's never strategically right or ethically right to be deceitful.
[01:23:16.459 --> 01:23:16.699]  Never.
[01:23:16.779 --> 01:23:17.539]  That's why I was asking.
[01:23:18.099 --> 01:23:18.619]  I never do it.
[01:23:18.659 --> 01:23:19.820]  I'm just like a bull in a china shop.
[01:23:20.601 --> 01:23:26.907]  But I can see strategically then, that gives them a big advantage because they can lie, but in the end that's why they're discredited because they do lie.
[01:23:26.927 --> 01:23:27.247]  That's right.
[01:23:27.267 --> 01:23:28.929]  We have the advantage because we don't lie.
[01:23:29.449 --> 01:23:34.695]  That is, being always and not having to worry about what lie you told last is a tremendous advantage.
[01:23:34.975 --> 01:23:35.455]  Absolutely.
[01:23:35.475 --> 01:23:36.737]  Just say it the way it really is.
[01:23:36.997 --> 01:23:38.699]  I don't think we need to resort to those methods.
[01:23:39.611 --> 01:23:46.674]  So anyway, the step is we've got to get networked together, we've got to help each other get into these power centers and be prepared to do battle.
[01:23:47.034 --> 01:23:48.994]  Now right now, there's a perfect example of that.
[01:23:49.014 --> 01:23:56.617]  There are these Ron Paul groups that are struggling to get their delegates seated at the various state nominating committees and conventions.
[01:23:57.097 --> 01:24:00.959]  And they're just learning now what the reality of political life is.
[01:24:02.659 --> 01:24:03.820]  People say no, you can't.
[01:24:03.981 --> 01:24:05.262]  They can't, yeah.
[01:24:05.282 --> 01:24:08.064]  What if they put their energy into Cadres of Fighting NAU?
[01:24:09.265 --> 01:24:14.009]  I've said Paul should tell them, give them work to do, and give them ideas where they can actually bear some fruit.
[01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:20.355]  Well, also I think they need to be prepared to face this kind of opposition within these Republican groups.
[01:24:20.695 --> 01:24:24.319]  For example, right now I was talking with a few people just the other day.
[01:24:24.339 --> 01:24:28.804]  They said, well, you know, they broke the rules during the convention.
[01:24:29.165 --> 01:24:30.466]  They actually broke their rules.
[01:24:30.506 --> 01:24:32.529]  And I said to them, well, of course they did.
[01:24:32.549 --> 01:24:33.990]  What are rules to these people?
[01:24:35.592 --> 01:24:42.857]  All of you out there, engaging and losing is half the battle, because you learn they really are corrupt, and you learn their tricks, and you get smarter each time.
[01:24:42.997 --> 01:24:43.437]  That's right.
[01:24:43.757 --> 01:24:45.919]  And so you know that you're dealing with totalitarians.
[01:24:46.199 --> 01:24:50.802]  Totalitarians have one moral code, and that's the morality of war.
[01:24:52.523 --> 01:24:54.966]  There's only one immoral act, and that's to lose.
[01:24:55.427 --> 01:24:56.428]  Everything else is moral.
[01:24:56.609 --> 01:24:57.630]  That's what we're up against.
[01:24:57.970 --> 01:25:00.233]  So, what do you do when you're facing people like that?
[01:25:00.494 --> 01:25:08.604]  That doesn't mean you have to adopt that morality, but it does mean you have to be prepared for them to do absolutely anything to keep you from winning.
[01:25:09.265 --> 01:25:12.329]  And now, what you do about that, I cannot give advice.
[01:25:12.629 --> 01:25:23.602]  Let's say that you went to a convention and you knew that if you had a majority vote, you thought that these people might bring thugs in to just physically beat you up and throw you out.
[01:25:24.122 --> 01:25:24.702]  That happens.
[01:25:24.763 --> 01:25:25.583]  It happens all the time.
[01:25:26.043 --> 01:25:26.784]  What do you do about it?
[01:25:26.804 --> 01:25:29.026]  A hundred years ago, they would mow down labor unions.
[01:25:29.066 --> 01:25:29.906]  Yeah, right.
[01:25:30.226 --> 01:25:31.527]  This is as old as history.
[01:25:31.547 --> 01:25:32.768]  Now they run the private prisons.
[01:25:32.828 --> 01:25:33.028]  Yeah.
[01:25:33.369 --> 01:25:34.529]  So now what do you do with that?
[01:25:34.870 --> 01:25:36.251]  And I know what I would do.
[01:25:36.291 --> 01:25:38.712]  I would get all my big sons and say, come on with me.
[01:25:39.053 --> 01:25:40.133]  As many big guys as I could.
[01:25:40.193 --> 01:25:43.116]  That's why they got the SWAT teams ready to mow you down and plant bombs on you.
[01:25:43.376 --> 01:25:45.797]  So you got to educate people that they're the terrorists first.
[01:25:45.917 --> 01:25:46.398]  That's right.
[01:25:46.498 --> 01:25:46.638]  Yeah.
[01:25:47.098 --> 01:25:48.559]  So there's no simple answer, is there?
[01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:49.480]  But we do have to
[01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:51.041]  No, I mean, that really does come down to it.
[01:25:51.081 --> 01:25:52.262]  This country had a lot of freedom.
[01:25:52.322 --> 01:25:54.703]  We haven't been perfect because people were willing to kill.
[01:25:55.364 --> 01:25:57.185]  And there was a rule, you mess with me, I'm going to kill you.
[01:25:57.225 --> 01:26:04.570]  That's why down here in Texas, in old Texas, there wasn't a lot of cheating and stealing going on because you mess with somebody's daughter, or you cheat somebody, they're going to kill you.
[01:26:05.110 --> 01:26:08.192]  I mean, just 50, 60 years ago, people would kill you around here.
[01:26:08.253 --> 01:26:10.454]  Now, we've been gelded and ninnied, so there's more corruption.
[01:26:10.474 --> 01:26:12.155]  But it used to, I mean, I remember the stories.
[01:26:12.175 --> 01:26:15.657]  I mean, I had great-grandpas and people who went and killed people.
[01:26:16.198 --> 01:26:19.360]  I mean, you know, you cheat them, they're just going to kill you, and then nothing's really done about it.
[01:26:19.820 --> 01:26:22.442]  Yeah, it didn't happen very often, because that was the consequence.
[01:26:22.742 --> 01:26:29.065]  I know that in the pioneer days, when just about everybody had a six-shooter strapped to their hip, there was very little crime.
[01:26:30.086 --> 01:26:30.466]  Obviously.
[01:26:30.486 --> 01:26:33.828]  Now, contrary to what you see in the Western movies... Well, here's an example.
[01:26:33.868 --> 01:26:37.370]  Let's say you rob somebody's cotton shipment being taken down by wagons.
[01:26:37.990 --> 01:26:40.571]  This is, you know, my great-great-great-grandpa Johnson.
[01:26:40.952 --> 01:26:46.815]  You know, if somebody did rob the people bringing that down, they would spend whatever it took to track them down and kill them.
[01:26:47.515 --> 01:26:53.019]  And so it's just people took things seriously, and the police used to... Look, we used to have 300,000 cops 15 years ago.
[01:26:53.479 --> 01:26:54.740]  If your house got robbed, they'd come out.
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:56.781]  Now we have 2 million, they won't come out to your house.
[01:26:56.801 --> 01:26:59.163]  We're going to continue during this break on the InfoWars streams.
[01:26:59.343 --> 01:27:00.644]  Come over to InfoWars, listen right now.
[01:27:02.761 --> 01:27:04.021]  Well, what can I say?
[01:27:04.041 --> 01:27:06.283]  John, go ahead and cut that feed for me, okay?
[01:27:06.803 --> 01:27:07.203]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:27:07.403 --> 01:27:10.465]  I'm not advocating that people track down some criminal.
[01:27:10.485 --> 01:27:11.726]  No, no, I'm not saying that.
[01:27:11.786 --> 01:27:19.050]  I'm saying that used to there wasn't as much crime because people knew that not just the police, the citizens were going to come after you.
[01:27:19.150 --> 01:27:20.191]  Yeah, there were posse's.
[01:27:20.751 --> 01:27:29.837]  And I'm not all in favor of the lynch mob, but I do think that posse had a role to play in capturing a criminal and bringing them to justice where they could then
[01:27:31.458 --> 01:27:34.039]  But again, that shows when the people were the police.
[01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:36.901]  It wasn't the government and the people hating each other.
[01:27:37.341 --> 01:27:38.362]  No, the people were the police.
[01:27:38.382 --> 01:27:40.983]  Anytime the government tries to separate that, that's tyranny.
[01:27:41.844 --> 01:27:43.365]  And of course that's what we have today.
[01:27:43.645 --> 01:27:51.930]  They want the people to think that the police are a separate entity, and actually I think they instill that in the minds of the police more than they do the people.
[01:27:52.450 --> 01:27:55.613]  I've talked to some policemen recently and they said, you know, it's true.
[01:27:55.933 --> 01:27:58.815]  We are sort of getting the impression that we are the elitists.
[01:27:59.156 --> 01:28:04.160]  You know, if we get stopped for speeding, we can flash our badge and we get special treatment.
[01:28:04.420 --> 01:28:07.342]  That just came out in the California paper that 996,000 are above the law.
[01:28:09.764 --> 01:28:15.828]  Yeah, they said it's nice to know that you belong to a little inside group that, you know, you get special privileges.
[01:28:16.168 --> 01:28:19.851]  Well, now, I think this guy just described the whole purpose of being part of government.
[01:28:20.211 --> 01:28:21.452]  They have special privileges.
[01:28:21.492 --> 01:28:22.413]  They don't have to obey.
[01:28:22.553 --> 01:28:23.533]  They get waved through.
[01:28:23.553 --> 01:28:24.674]  They get waved through.
[01:28:24.854 --> 01:28:26.536]  They get special consideration.
[01:28:26.556 --> 01:28:29.057]  They commit crimes and never be brought to justice.
[01:28:29.598 --> 01:28:30.298]  So, it's a problem.
[01:28:30.318 --> 01:28:34.901]  And then that destroys societies, because then it gets more and more corrupt, to where why should anybody have a business?
[01:28:34.941 --> 01:28:37.083]  The cops are just going to take it, and then you're like Mexico.
[01:28:37.623 --> 01:28:44.566]  So what we've really got here is that there are certain mentalities that gravitate into organized crime and government.
[01:28:44.706 --> 01:28:45.246]  Psychopaths!
[01:28:45.726 --> 01:28:52.769]  And when you think about it, in today's world, there's not an awful lot of difference between organized crime and government, except that government is more organized.
[01:28:54.068 --> 01:28:54.628]  Absolutely.
[01:28:54.888 --> 01:28:57.589]  It's the same mentality that gravitates into those jobs.
[01:28:57.950 --> 01:29:06.673]  Now that doesn't mean that there aren't well-intentioned people, and I know people that go into government work because they really want to serve society.
[01:29:07.193 --> 01:29:10.595]  And I think of people that used to go into the IRS because they thought they were...
[01:29:11.715 --> 01:29:20.199]  Well, that actually I found is one of the evil's greatest powers, is they have all these minions who are compartmentalized, carrying out evil, believing they're part of something good.
[01:29:20.219 --> 01:29:22.139]  They believe they're part of something good, yes.
[01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:29.503]  And you mentioned this earlier, Alex, you said that something that starts out good, takes on a different form as it matures.
[01:29:30.043 --> 01:29:37.046]  And people become part of something, and the mechanism itself becomes more important than the reason for the mechanism.
[01:29:37.506 --> 01:29:48.074]  In other words, the government agency, the government machine, the force of government, the organization itself becomes a reason rather than the original reason, which was to protect the people.
[01:29:48.515 --> 01:29:51.857]  That's gone, and just the structure remains, and it serves itself.
[01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:57.422]  And the social architects know what they're doing.
[01:29:57.442 --> 01:29:58.222]  We're going live right now.
[01:29:58.242 --> 01:30:01.505]  Here we go.
[01:30:01.545 --> 01:30:01.825]  Okay, John.
[01:30:07.706 --> 01:30:11.910]  Look, I said I'd take calls.
[01:30:12.450 --> 01:30:13.271]  And I haven't.
[01:30:14.051 --> 01:30:15.072]  And I'm not going to have time to.
[01:30:15.112 --> 01:30:15.853]  I'm sorry, everybody.
[01:30:15.873 --> 01:30:21.577]  We're going to go about five minutes into the next hour, but I have a meeting I have to be at at ten after, so we can't go too much overdrive.
[01:30:21.997 --> 01:30:26.221]  G. Edward Griffin is going to be speaking tonight at the University of Texas.
[01:30:28.242 --> 01:30:31.025]  And that is in the Jester Dormitory.
[01:30:31.065 --> 01:30:34.547]  It's a large area of large classrooms that hold like 400 people apiece.
[01:30:34.567 --> 01:30:37.370]  They may even be in one of the bigger ones.
[01:30:37.410 --> 01:30:40.993]  You can go to PNAC Citizen or go to BraveNewBooks.com.
[01:30:41.013 --> 01:30:45.896]  They have a link over there where you can find it all for yourself as well.
[01:30:46.397 --> 01:30:49.379]  And Jim McGriffin, I'm really impressed with this interview today.
[01:30:49.439 --> 01:30:51.261]  It's really gone well being face-to-face with you.
[01:30:52.182 --> 01:31:06.873]  I want to, in the next few months, have you back on for maybe two or three hours to really get into solutions and Freedom Force International and the types of moral power we can take on to tear down their major structures and then, as I said, a much more limited government to guard against that because the pure anarchists don't understand.
[01:31:07.654 --> 01:31:11.037]  In even bands of five, six nomadic humans, you're going to have a leader.
[01:31:11.618 --> 01:31:13.459]  And so you're always going to have centralization.
[01:31:13.539 --> 01:31:15.161]  Anarchy only goes on for about five hours.
[01:31:15.781 --> 01:31:17.603]  And then Law of the Jungle comes in.
[01:31:17.643 --> 01:31:25.510]  We need the good people, as Thomas Jefferson said, we need to band together for limited government as a bulwark against the state and against organized crime.
[01:31:25.790 --> 01:31:27.271]  And I want to get more of your comments on that.
[01:31:27.972 --> 01:31:32.576]  Well, boy, you go over so many things so fast, Alex, I can hardly keep track.
[01:31:32.917 --> 01:31:36.580]  All I can remember is the last thing you said, which is so true.
[01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:37.941]  Anarchy doesn't last.
[01:31:37.961 --> 01:31:38.902]  You said five hours?
[01:31:38.922 --> 01:31:42.305]  Okay, I would say five days, but what difference does that make?
[01:31:43.386 --> 01:31:52.353]  In conditions of anarchy, always the guy with the biggest muscle, the biggest fist, or the biggest weapon winds up dominating.
[01:31:52.393 --> 01:31:52.913]  King Rad.
[01:31:53.193 --> 01:31:53.934]  King Rad, yeah.
[01:31:54.314 --> 01:32:08.545]  And so, when you talk about this political spectrum, supposedly between total government on one end and zero government on the other, and you talk about the gradients in between, what you're really talking about is if you take the ends of this and bend them up,
[01:32:09.085 --> 01:32:36.513]  And you make a circle out of it, so that instead of a straight line, you've bent that straight line up, and now it's a circle, and you see that the end of the line that represents zero government is now touching the other end of the line that represents total government, and that is what you're talking about, because under conditions of anarchy, in an instant you step over that line, and you are subject completely to the totalitarian dictatorship of the person with the biggest fist or the biggest weapon.
[01:32:36.673 --> 01:32:40.356]  And then it's escape from New York, he's the Duke, he's A number one.
[01:32:40.416 --> 01:32:54.446]  I mean it just happens like that and that's what these... But you know when you really watch these mainline anarchist groups, I don't mean their followers, it's all foundation funded, they hire them, Limbaugh's called for riots in Denver, so is Recreate, you know, 68, Subgribs.
[01:32:55.607 --> 01:33:00.451]  Again, they want to bring... and you find out a lot of these anarchists claim they're anarchists, but then they'll tell you they're communists.
[01:33:01.111 --> 01:33:03.233]  And so that's really the new cover for them.
[01:33:03.593 --> 01:33:03.853]  Yes.
[01:33:04.253 --> 01:33:10.637]  Well, they're Marxists-Leninists because they're remembering that old line about Marx, that the state will wither away.
[01:33:10.997 --> 01:33:12.017]  They actually believe that.
[01:33:12.277 --> 01:33:25.464]  That under conditions of mature socialism, Marx taught, well then, mankind will have been reconditioned and retrained, and all these evil characteristics have been weeded out, and now we can live in perfect harmony with each other.
[01:33:25.964 --> 01:33:26.784]  It's ten times worse.
[01:33:26.985 --> 01:33:30.907]  Much worse, because there's always this leadership group.
[01:33:31.187 --> 01:33:34.209]  They call it the Communist Party, or the Vanguard, or the Proletarian.
[01:33:34.509 --> 01:33:35.630]  There's always a leader for that.
[01:33:35.650 --> 01:33:36.750]  The Central Committee.
[01:33:36.930 --> 01:33:38.131]  The Central Committee.
[01:33:38.151 --> 01:33:43.154]  But the utopia's never working because of the evil group that still has freedom across the road.
[01:33:43.294 --> 01:33:44.035]  That's right.
[01:33:44.075 --> 01:33:45.176]  They always have to have an enemy.
[01:33:45.456 --> 01:33:53.582]  So I think they're drawing this from the idea that the state somehow will wither away and then people will live in peace without any government regulation of any kind.
[01:33:53.822 --> 01:33:54.643]  And it's a myth.
[01:33:54.783 --> 01:33:56.685]  It's totally contrary to human nature.
[01:33:58.118 --> 01:34:02.421]  Actually, we are going to now go into six, seven minutes of overdrive.
[01:34:02.441 --> 01:34:05.844]  I know I have an important call coming in, too, so we'll line that up outside.
[01:34:06.325 --> 01:34:07.666]  G. Edward Griffin is our guest.
[01:34:07.686 --> 01:34:10.328]  We'll say bye to the Genesis audience now.
[01:34:10.408 --> 01:34:12.209]  He'll be speaking UT campus, 8 p.m.
[01:34:12.449 --> 01:34:13.430]  to 945 p.m.
[01:34:13.470 --> 01:34:14.971]  Jester dorm room, A121A.
[01:34:15.111 --> 01:34:16.452]  We'll go to PNAC
[01:34:19.875 --> 01:34:24.258]  It's pnacitizen.org or freedom-force.org.
[01:34:24.598 --> 01:34:26.399]  Tonight, UT, 8 p.m.
[01:34:26.419 --> 01:34:27.660]  to 945 p.m.
[01:34:28.401 --> 01:34:29.061]  I'm out of time.
[01:34:29.381 --> 01:34:30.222]  Be sure and support us.
[01:34:30.282 --> 01:34:31.883]  Get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[01:34:32.203 --> 01:34:32.943]  Buy the documentaries.
[01:34:32.983 --> 01:34:33.544]  Get them out, folks.
[01:34:33.564 --> 01:34:34.324]  God bless you all.
[01:34:34.544 --> 01:34:38.887]  We now go into overdrive on the internet streams at InfoWars.com.
[01:34:39.107 --> 01:34:41.489]  Gotta go there to hear the last eight minutes at InfoWars.com.
[01:34:42.793 --> 01:34:43.353]  Thank you, John.
[01:34:43.373 --> 01:34:44.554]  Thank you for listening to GTV.
[01:34:44.574 --> 01:34:45.054]  Take care, Jones.
[01:34:45.074 --> 01:34:45.714]  Appreciate it, bro.
[01:34:46.034 --> 01:34:46.435]  Anytime.
[01:34:47.235 --> 01:34:47.815]  Thank you, my friend.
[01:34:48.616 --> 01:34:55.258]  Okay, in closing here, at the end, I am just going to give you six, seven minutes, sir.
[01:34:55.298 --> 01:35:03.682]  We've got about, probably, you know, ten thousand people on the web that are listening, and the Prison Planet TV members that are watching the letters we put on YouTube and Google.
[01:35:03.982 --> 01:35:10.005]  Just other key points about Freedom Force International, and then a few minutes, if you can, on the election, where that's going.
[01:35:10.445 --> 01:35:17.961]  uh... what's happening right now uh... with that and i mean we talk to break the total fiction but how important is to point out that it's a fiction
[01:35:18.837 --> 01:35:21.418]  Yeah, I'd like to flip those, if I may, and talk about how I went first.
[01:35:21.438 --> 01:35:22.499]  Sure, sure.
[01:35:22.579 --> 01:35:26.281]  That'll be somewhat my topic tonight at the University.
[01:35:26.881 --> 01:35:40.908]  And when I called the speech the Quigley Formula, I'm referring, of course, to Professor Carol Quigley, who wrote the book Tragedy and Hope, and who was President Clinton's mentor when he was a student at Georgetown University.
[01:35:41.428 --> 01:35:42.609]  The significant thing about
[01:35:44.250 --> 01:35:59.458]  Uh, about Quigley, is that he was a collectivist, he was a historian for a secret society created by Cecil Rhodes that evolved over the years, still exists today, and in the United States its presence is known as the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:36:00.078 --> 01:36:12.025]  I'm sure your audience is well aware of the Council on Foreign Relations and the fact that this small group, relatively small group of people, around 4,000 altogether, are actually the hidden rulers of the United States.
[01:36:12.465 --> 01:36:26.254]  So here's a guy, Quigley, who was the historian of this group, a very respected and prestigious professor at Georgetown University, and in his book he raises the question, he says, how is it possible
[01:36:26.954 --> 01:36:32.317]  For us to have total control over the population, for their own good, obviously.
[01:36:32.557 --> 01:36:33.837]  It's always the collectivist theme.
[01:36:34.338 --> 01:36:38.800]  And yet, let them think that they are participating in their own political destiny.
[01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:51.586]  Because they need that, and now that's what the futurists and people like Bill Joyce say, is they say, will the elite even let us survive and give us kind of a false political subsystem while they have the advanced technologies and the real civilization?
[01:36:51.866 --> 01:36:53.127]  Or will they just get rid of us?
[01:36:53.647 --> 01:36:53.967]  Go ahead.
[01:36:54.028 --> 01:36:57.791]  No, they're not going to get rid of us because they want us in servitude.
[01:36:58.311 --> 01:36:59.832]  So that's the very issue he raises.
[01:36:59.852 --> 01:37:00.633]  They need the power trip.
[01:37:00.653 --> 01:37:02.414]  Well, they need the power trip, but they need the servants.
[01:37:02.474 --> 01:37:04.076]  They need the people to run the machine.
[01:37:04.096 --> 01:37:05.917]  Well, they need the people left to torture, too.
[01:37:06.638 --> 01:37:09.040]  Yes, well... Because they're powerful, they've got to...
[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:10.000]  That's true.
[01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:12.381]  Well, Quigley doesn't go into that, but he does deal with it.
[01:37:12.421 --> 01:37:14.322]  I've read Tragedy in Hope and Anglo-American Establishment.
[01:37:14.442 --> 01:37:15.483]  Well, then you know the story.
[01:37:15.503 --> 01:37:17.003]  For those that don't, go ahead.
[01:37:17.083 --> 01:37:18.464]  And basically he says, how do we do this?
[01:37:18.524 --> 01:37:19.785]  And he says, the answer is simple.
[01:37:20.245 --> 01:37:33.751]  He said, we form two major political parties, we run them both from behind the scenes, and we let them fight each other over minor issues, so long as the electorate has to choose only between those two, then it makes no difference which one wins.
[01:37:34.011 --> 01:37:37.313]  We always remain in firm control of the political system.
[01:37:37.853 --> 01:37:53.167]  That's what I'll be talking about tonight, because I think people need to know that the elections that are coming upon us here, and all of this fierce debate between an Obama and a Clinton, and I can't even think of a Republican's name.
[01:37:53.387 --> 01:37:54.088]  Lord McCain!
[01:37:54.388 --> 01:37:55.068]  Lord McCain!
[01:37:55.189 --> 01:37:56.330]  Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb!
[01:37:56.370 --> 01:37:58.472]  Bomb McCain, yeah.
[01:37:58.552 --> 01:38:03.196]  It's all part of this very show that Quigley was talking about.
[01:38:03.796 --> 01:38:16.540]  And until Americans realize that the political parties, Republicans and Democrats, are merely two different branches of the same political party, they're never going to figure out what a solution to this problem is.
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:17.760]  They'll just be bounced back.
[01:38:17.780 --> 01:38:19.521]  We've got to shatter the left-right paradigm.
[01:38:19.561 --> 01:38:20.821]  I mean, listen to the corporate line.
[01:38:21.221 --> 01:38:23.324]  They're really trying to get everybody back into that.
[01:38:23.364 --> 01:38:24.626]  They say that's why they like Obama.
[01:38:24.886 --> 01:38:26.568]  They say, we want to bring everybody back together.
[01:38:26.828 --> 01:38:28.791]  They mean bring the people back into the theater.
[01:38:29.031 --> 01:38:31.154]  Bring them back into the false paradigm.
[01:38:31.194 --> 01:38:32.736]  Bring them back into the simulation.
[01:38:32.977 --> 01:38:36.842]  It's key to fully shatter that so that they know those are false choices.
[01:38:37.262 --> 01:38:37.662]  That's right.
[01:38:37.962 --> 01:38:38.762]  That's it, exactly.
[01:38:38.823 --> 01:38:39.803]  It's a false paradigm.
[01:38:40.243 --> 01:38:43.824]  And yet, still, I would say 90% of the American people are falling for it.
[01:38:44.264 --> 01:38:47.985]  They like to align themselves either with, oh, he's a left-winger, or he's a right-winger.
[01:38:48.005 --> 01:38:53.187]  Well, I mean, it's what everybody's talking about at the water cooler, and these things suck you into these false debates.
[01:38:53.307 --> 01:38:53.527]  Yeah.
[01:38:53.867 --> 01:38:57.648]  And it's really the left and the right wing of the same ugly bird, and that's collectivism.
[01:38:58.028 --> 01:38:59.129]  And that's my main theme.
[01:39:00.805 --> 01:39:03.346]  I'll use that as a jumping place to get to the solution.
[01:39:03.666 --> 01:39:04.747]  Back to the solution.
[01:39:04.767 --> 01:39:13.411]  Listen, before you go, please go meet with Trey in the back and let me set you up for like two more hours because stuff's moving fast in the next couple weeks over phone.
[01:39:13.591 --> 01:39:15.412]  You're out in California, right?
[01:39:15.452 --> 01:39:15.752]  Right.
[01:39:16.273 --> 01:39:20.115]  I'll have you on for a few hours to really get more into solutions with everybody.
[01:39:20.135 --> 01:39:20.815]  I'd love that, yeah.
[01:39:21.215 --> 01:39:21.535]  Yeah.
[01:39:21.895 --> 01:39:25.497]  And Freedom Force International, what are some of the other bedrock ideas?
[01:39:26.097 --> 01:39:28.818]  Well, the bedrock idea is to get clear on a creed.
[01:39:28.918 --> 01:39:29.778]  What do we believe in?
[01:39:29.798 --> 01:39:36.320]  You know, history is so full of examples where people have risen up, and at great cost in treasure and blood, they've oversold.
[01:39:36.340 --> 01:39:37.461]  And some new evil takes over.
[01:39:38.101 --> 01:39:39.582]  Joe, I'm just the same, or worse.
[01:39:40.022 --> 01:39:44.325]  And the reason for that is that it's easy for people to get focused on what they hate.
[01:39:44.685 --> 01:39:45.466]  They don't like this.
[01:39:45.506 --> 01:39:46.166]  They don't like that.
[01:39:46.427 --> 01:39:47.547]  Oh, we don't like this guy.
[01:39:47.667 --> 01:39:49.128]  Not just what we hate, but what we like.
[01:39:49.669 --> 01:39:51.050]  But they don't know what they like.
[01:39:51.430 --> 01:39:52.270]  Well, what they think they like.
[01:39:52.290 --> 01:39:52.971]  I know what I like.
[01:39:53.271 --> 01:39:56.633]  Well, these people that I'm talking about have no idea what they like.
[01:39:56.653 --> 01:40:03.758]  They like him because he's a Republican or a Democrat, or because he's got nice teeth, or because they like his wife, or something like that.
[01:40:03.958 --> 01:40:06.379]  They have no concept of political ideology.
[01:40:06.399 --> 01:40:13.404]  I don't think the public realizes, they're starting to realize how life and death, how dangerous it is for your economy, for your checkbook, for your family, for your health.
[01:40:13.584 --> 01:40:13.864]  Yeah.
[01:40:13.964 --> 01:40:16.466]  To let a bunch of wild control freaks be in control.
[01:40:16.586 --> 01:40:18.287]  Yeah, all they care about is, is he sincere?
[01:40:18.587 --> 01:40:19.688]  Oh, I like his sincerity.
[01:40:19.708 --> 01:40:20.668]  I like what he's saying.
[01:40:20.688 --> 01:40:21.489]  Now, let's be clear.
[01:40:21.549 --> 01:40:22.349]  Those are puppets.
[01:40:23.250 --> 01:40:24.011]  And that's what they hate.
[01:40:24.051 --> 01:40:27.613]  They love being called evil or love being called good, as long as they're the boss.
[01:40:27.673 --> 01:40:33.997]  But when you point out that a bunch of special interests with a scientific dictatorship are just using these as front dummies,
[01:40:34.737 --> 01:40:36.298]  They really hate being called puppets.
[01:40:36.699 --> 01:40:37.679]  Oh, they don't like that at all.
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:41.242]  In fact, I think some of them don't even realize it, or don't want to realize it.
[01:40:41.462 --> 01:40:44.004]  They know, they know, but they don't like to think about it.
[01:40:44.044 --> 01:40:45.766]  They like to... I think that... Well, that's the thing.
[01:40:45.806 --> 01:40:52.251]  I mean, I like meeting with fellow patriots, and I like going out, but it kind of gets tiring because I'm busy and I'm not that ego-driven.
[01:40:52.731 --> 01:40:53.812]  I'm more idea-driven.
[01:40:53.852 --> 01:40:55.593]  That's what I'm excited into.
[01:40:56.054 --> 01:41:01.278]  And, you know, liberty and freedom, but I'd rather be out gardening or out fishing or just away from people or with my family.
[01:41:01.958 --> 01:41:06.204]  I go to events, shake hands, but I don't go to a lot of events because, frankly, I don't overall like it.
[01:41:07.205 --> 01:41:11.070]  It's kind of embarrassing and being worshipped and loved, which is great.
[01:41:11.090 --> 01:41:12.131]  It's a communing.
[01:41:12.472 --> 01:41:18.159]  But when I see these globalists who will go to all these events and shake all these hands and do this, and I've met them and I've talked to them and I've read their...
[01:41:20.181 --> 01:41:25.263]  Well, I love fancy hats and medals and medallions.
[01:41:25.423 --> 01:41:35.628]  I think they're lesser men, but men who are greater than them intellectually and everything else, we, and I'm not tooting my horn, but compared to them we are heads above, we don't like all that.
[01:41:35.688 --> 01:41:36.788]  But it's a responsibility.
[01:41:37.028 --> 01:41:37.949]  It's work for us.
[01:41:38.029 --> 01:41:42.251]  If we're going to live in peace, we have to, as you said, be in power and defeat these people.
[01:41:42.311 --> 01:41:44.972]  It's either they're going to beat us, or we're going to beat them.
[01:41:45.692 --> 01:41:46.633]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:41:46.993 --> 01:41:51.477]  And I think that the time has come for people to realize this is an either-or situation.
[01:41:52.358 --> 01:41:54.060]  So, anyway, back to my theme.
[01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:55.942]  It's very simple, you see, what can we do?
[01:41:56.202 --> 01:42:00.205]  First thing, we better be clear on what we believe in, not just what we're against.
[01:42:00.266 --> 01:42:02.788]  And that's where the importance comes in of the creed of freedom.
[01:42:03.168 --> 01:42:06.491]  And I urge people to come to our website and spend a little time.
[01:42:06.551 --> 01:42:07.352]  It's www.
[01:42:08.653 --> 01:42:12.055]  Freedom-force.org.
[01:42:12.155 --> 01:42:13.816]  Org stands for organization.
[01:42:14.276 --> 01:42:16.417]  And flip over to the section that says Creed.
[01:42:16.837 --> 01:42:18.198]  And spend a little time reading it.
[01:42:18.738 --> 01:42:21.240]  And that is our statement of goals.
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:22.460]  That's our statement of principle.
[01:42:22.721 --> 01:42:26.563]  That's the glue that holds our members together in 58 countries right now.
[01:42:27.843 --> 01:42:31.164]  It's the basis for our international brotherhood, Alex.
[01:42:31.924 --> 01:42:42.888]  Once we're in agreement on that, then we cannot be divided by nationality, by culture, by religion, by race, by economic status, by gender.
[01:42:43.308 --> 01:42:45.669]  All of these things become immaterial.
[01:42:46.009 --> 01:42:48.730]  We become a true international brotherhood.
[01:42:49.050 --> 01:42:52.951]  There's never been anything quite like it, so far, of which I'm aware.
[01:42:53.211 --> 01:43:06.318]  We need a counter guild of people that are invested in liberty, and we need to work with each other in business, and network, and not just in political, but in business, and we need to have symbols, and we need to traffic with each other.
[01:43:06.698 --> 01:43:09.339]  And we have a lot more power than the collectivists.
[01:43:09.620 --> 01:43:12.021]  This is a voluntary association.
[01:43:12.461 --> 01:43:12.941]  Exactly.
[01:43:13.282 --> 01:43:14.122]  And that's the whole thing.
[01:43:14.202 --> 01:43:21.666]  And that loose will, that paradigm, that frequency, that signature, is much more powerful than the enemy.
[01:43:21.786 --> 01:43:25.188]  Yes, and as long as we agree on what it is we believe in.
[01:43:25.509 --> 01:43:26.769]  That's been the missing ingredient.
[01:43:27.310 --> 01:43:28.130]  We're all for freedom.
[01:43:28.431 --> 01:43:33.814]  I believe in family, the second amendment, free market, national sovereignty, free will.
[01:43:34.395 --> 01:43:38.758]  I do not believe in the CPS, corrupt police, wickedness, corrupt judges, all this.
[01:43:39.098 --> 01:43:41.019]  They have to be brought to justice.
[01:43:41.039 --> 01:43:41.920]  I think that's also important.
[01:43:41.980 --> 01:43:52.967]  Well, I invite anybody who's interested in this theme, and I know all of your listeners are, to come to this site and read the Creed of Freedom and give it some thought, and then you'll see exactly what it is that unites us.
[01:43:53.147 --> 01:44:05.896]  And I think what you're doing is the answer, but I think also, even if people don't even join your group, I think they should, but if there's other leaders out there, who maybe a 20-year-old watching right now is going to end up, you know, being the leader, I'm not saying just one leader will do it, but maybe the straw that breaks the camel's back won't
[01:44:06.096 --> 01:44:14.358]  We may get executed, killed, maybe 200 years from now you're watching this, you know, in some illegal transmission, you know, that sits into your bubble chip in your head.
[01:44:14.378 --> 01:44:16.659]  I mean, maybe you're out there watching right now.
[01:44:16.679 --> 01:44:27.281]  You need to understand that take these ideas, change it, modernize it, whatever you do, just know that humanity, the species, needs to go on and be free and not have these control freaks destroy what we are.
[01:44:27.661 --> 01:44:33.262]  G. Edward Griffin, author of The Creature from Jekyll Island, freedom-force.org, speaking at UT tonight.
[01:44:33.543 --> 01:44:34.343]  It's been great having you.
[01:44:34.363 --> 01:44:35.203]  Look forward to talking to you.
[01:44:35.623 --> 01:44:36.644]  Thank you so much, my friend.
[01:44:37.084 --> 01:44:38.345]  Good to meet you after all this time.
[01:44:38.445 --> 01:44:38.966]  God bless you.
[01:44:39.006 --> 01:44:40.787]  Folks, that's it for this transmission.
[01:44:40.807 --> 01:44:43.370]  I want to thank you all for tuning in.
[01:44:43.930 --> 01:44:47.974]  And I do, again, hope that you will go to the University of Texas tonight.
[01:44:47.994 --> 01:44:53.919]  If you're watching this on the web, 82945 PM, Jester Dorm, Room A121A.
[01:44:54.179 --> 01:44:55.860]  And don't forget all of our sponsors.
[01:44:56.761 --> 01:45:03.303]  Don't forget the films and books that we carry, like Washington, You're Fired.
[01:45:03.343 --> 01:45:05.204]  This new video is excellent by William Lewis.
[01:45:05.964 --> 01:45:08.345]  Don't forget American Drug War that I'm in and I consulted on.
[01:45:09.025 --> 01:45:11.786]  It exposes how the government ships in the drugs and how it's all a big fraud.
[01:45:12.087 --> 01:45:14.808]  Very, very important at InfoWars.com.
[01:45:14.828 --> 01:45:19.729]  We now will go back into our retransmission from the first and second hour of the show.
[01:45:19.749 --> 01:45:21.290]  If you're listening on the web, we re-looped that.
[01:45:21.670 --> 01:45:25.232]  Luke Rodowski got Jimmy Carter to say there should be a new 9-11 investigation.
[01:45:25.572 --> 01:45:27.273]  Gary Hart saying, yeah, he's afraid the U.S.
[01:45:27.293 --> 01:45:28.414]  will stage terror attacks.
[01:45:29.195 --> 01:45:30.775]  Also how they're trying to set up people.
[01:45:30.836 --> 01:45:35.578]  David Frum, the neocon, attacking We Are Change L.A., being caught on video.
