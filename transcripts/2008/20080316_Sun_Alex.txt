[00:00:19.147 --> 00:00:20.488]  He stands for truth.
[00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:23.750]  He stands for justice.
[00:00:25.131 --> 00:00:26.693]  He stands for what's right.
[00:00:27.573 --> 00:00:29.895]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:30.896 --> 00:00:33.718]  Call Alex now, toll free at 877-590-5525.
[00:00:39.258 --> 00:00:51.826]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[00:00:51.886 --> 00:00:53.107]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:53.207 --> 00:00:53.627]  Welcome.
[00:00:53.847 --> 00:00:55.909]  It is already Sunday, March 16, 2008.
[00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.333]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours.
[00:01:02.353 --> 00:01:08.497]  I, of course, am your syndicated radio talk show host, Money Keeps Running, and then I come in on Sundays
[00:01:09.255 --> 00:01:14.259]  With a wrap up of the previous week and a look forward into the week coming up.
[00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:18.462]  Syndicated across the nation on more and more fine stations to pick us up.
[00:01:18.882 --> 00:01:24.726]  Now into a year of syndication with this Sunday broadcast that comes to you from deep in the heart of Texas.
[00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:31.391]  From News Radio 590 KLBJ and again syndicated across the country on stations like KCAA.
[00:01:32.451 --> 00:01:37.195]  Out in San Diego to fine stations in places like Kansas City, KCXL.
[00:01:38.271 --> 00:01:41.832]  And so many others that we unfortunately don't have time to mention or thank.
[00:01:42.113 --> 00:01:43.673]  We appreciate all of you out there.
[00:01:43.833 --> 00:01:44.133]  Okay.
[00:01:45.354 --> 00:01:47.335]  Here are the stacks I have in front of me.
[00:01:48.115 --> 00:01:49.476]  I have the economy stack.
[00:01:49.496 --> 00:01:56.899]  The greatest threat we have faced towards total economic collapse since the 1930s.
[00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.321]  I am looking at just massive crises.
[00:02:02.381 --> 00:02:04.021]  We're going to spend a lot of time on that.
[00:02:04.802 --> 00:02:07.883]  Also a huge stack of police state news as well.
[00:02:10.441 --> 00:02:19.188]  That we'll be breaking down as the private banks that have totally bankrupt this nation take private ownership of their chattel, of their slaves.
[00:02:19.568 --> 00:02:20.669]  And they even talk like that.
[00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.992]  I mean, this is just absolute bondage if we don't stand up now.
[00:02:24.732 --> 00:02:25.513]  We'll get into that.
[00:02:26.013 --> 00:02:35.821]  Also, there is a concerted talking point the last six months on Fox, CNN, MSNBC, all the major channels
[00:02:36.875 --> 00:02:55.332]  Saying, arrest anyone who says 9-11 is an inside job, take us to camps, kill us, beat us, tase us, we're gonna stage terror attacks, we're behind the terror, because we read mainstream government documents that say elements of our government have staged hundreds of terror attacks before, declassified.
[00:02:56.032 --> 00:03:00.216]  They say if you say that, you need to be quote, taken to a secret prison, tortured, killed, whatever.
[00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:07.863]  Now, I literally have found 15 clips of this this weekend, just spending about an hour Friday night looking for them.
[00:03:08.303 --> 00:03:09.884]  We're going to play a few of those today.
[00:03:09.944 --> 00:03:22.730]  In fact, I need to get somebody at my office to maybe put like a two-minute compilation down of just where they say, beat us, tase us, kill us, take us to camps, or how they said in the last six months, we're going to stage terror.
[00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:23.711]  We're going to stage terror.
[00:03:24.131 --> 00:03:29.354]  The 9-11 truthers, the people that expose that the government has been caught staging events, and that
[00:03:30.077 --> 00:03:31.898]  Hitler did it, and so many others have done it.
[00:03:31.918 --> 00:03:35.540]  You blow up your own building, blame it on your enemy, blame it on your neighbor, start a war.
[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.801]  Set up a martial law crackdown.
[00:03:40.422 --> 00:03:48.826]  We're the people exposing that, and the news started saying six months ago, we're behind it, we're behind it, we're terrorists, we're terrorists, we're gonna stage terror.
[00:03:49.446 --> 00:03:51.167]  Now, it's an oxymoron.
[00:03:51.447 --> 00:03:53.848]  We're exposing government-sponsored terror.
[00:03:53.928 --> 00:03:54.909]  We're non-violent.
[00:03:55.914 --> 00:03:56.635]  We're good to go.
[00:04:14.355 --> 00:04:21.801]  But in some cases, like, they'll throw a real bottle and hit a cop that doesn't know in the head, and then they don't get in trouble, but you'll see a captain grab the other cops and say, Stand down!
[00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:22.382]  Stand down!
[00:04:22.402 --> 00:04:25.364]  And you'll see the cops whisper in their ear, and then the cop goes, Ah!
[00:04:25.404 --> 00:04:27.286]  But cops have been getting mad and going public.
[00:04:27.586 --> 00:04:28.727]  That's why we know about this.
[00:04:29.788 --> 00:04:32.450]  Oh, you didn't know, it's now mainstream news that they stage this stuff.
[00:04:32.831 --> 00:04:35.473]  You got 60,000, 100,000 peaceful protesters.
[00:04:35.893 --> 00:04:36.694]  You want to stop them.
[00:04:37.114 --> 00:04:37.455]  You hire 20,
[00:04:39.617 --> 00:04:43.319]  Anarchist thugs to work with 20 or 30 cops, even give it some reality.
[00:04:43.359 --> 00:04:44.399]  This has come out in the news now.
[00:04:44.739 --> 00:04:47.801]  And they come up to cops and hit them in the head, bust bottles over their head.
[00:04:48.321 --> 00:04:49.802]  Cops will be bleeding on the ground.
[00:04:50.162 --> 00:04:51.103]  The case of Seattle.
[00:04:51.723 --> 00:04:54.665]  And then the news media shows that and says, see?
[00:04:55.065 --> 00:04:56.166]  Protests are bad.
[00:04:56.206 --> 00:04:57.706]  We've got to attack the whole crowd.
[00:04:57.967 --> 00:05:02.189]  And then they attack the old ladies and people in wheelchairs and people with their kids in strollers.
[00:05:02.992 --> 00:05:05.715]  And the news says, well, you saw the crowd get out of hand.
[00:05:05.775 --> 00:05:09.098]  And it was the cops hired to do that by the feds.
[00:05:09.378 --> 00:05:17.666]  That's now mainstream news, but... Look, I saw that happening, watching it on national television in 99.
[00:05:17.906 --> 00:05:18.827]  Then I interviewed police.
[00:05:18.867 --> 00:05:23.332]  Then it came out in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, and the Seattle Times, and Seattle Weekly.
[00:05:23.592 --> 00:05:24.613]  I made a film about it.
[00:05:24.673 --> 00:05:25.574]  I interviewed the police.
[00:05:26.621 --> 00:05:32.946]  The cops were mad, went public, said, yeah, our government hired them, protected them, let them attack us as a pretext to then go after everybody.
[00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:33.787]  That's why it came out.
[00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:42.994]  They just got caught a few months ago in Canada for the North American Union Summit they were having where the cops dressed up like anarchists and attacked the cops to go after the crowd, but I'm already digressing.
[00:05:43.314 --> 00:05:46.356]  We're the group that exposes that.
[00:05:46.376 --> 00:05:48.698]  9-11 Truth are the false flag exposers.
[00:05:49.098 --> 00:05:51.120]  We expose how governments, the Russians,
[00:05:52.366 --> 00:05:54.607]  The Israelis, the Arabs have been caught doing it.
[00:05:54.727 --> 00:05:55.448]  Everybody does it.
[00:05:55.788 --> 00:05:57.289]  It is a favorite trick.
[00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:05.913]  There are army training manuals, they've been declassified from the 60s, about how to stage terror attacks in Eastern Europe to blame it on Communists.
[00:06:06.413 --> 00:06:07.454]  You want to beat the Communists?
[00:06:08.494 --> 00:06:18.779]  Did you know Graham Greene's book, The Quiet American, is fiction, but it's based on non-fiction real events in Vietnam, where the CIA blows up markets full of children, and then says the Communists did it?
[00:06:19.494 --> 00:06:22.276]  And you better believe the Communists would blow stuff up and say, we did it.
[00:06:22.736 --> 00:06:27.059]  The point is, this is a well-documented, real tool.
[00:06:29.561 --> 00:06:38.947]  And to deny that governments do this, and to say that anyone who says governments do it, needs to be arrested, tortured, and killed.
[00:06:39.888 --> 00:06:42.429]  Now, the news has been saying that in unison.
[00:06:42.489 --> 00:06:44.891]  It's clearly a talking point by the government.
[00:06:45.487 --> 00:06:49.911]  That's been declassified in the 70s, that most of these big operatives on TV are CIA operatives.
[00:06:50.331 --> 00:06:52.693]  If you didn't know that, look up Operation Mockingbird.
[00:06:54.234 --> 00:07:01.299]  And they have these agents of influence all over the news media, and they started saying six months ago, arrest us, kill us, put us in camps, put us in work camps.
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.042]  And I said, folks, that's a talking point.
[00:07:05.363 --> 00:07:07.064]  I heard it all over national talk radio.
[00:07:08.911 --> 00:07:12.053]  And then the low-level local hosts then parrot what the big guys say.
[00:07:12.073 --> 00:07:14.274]  They're not really on the payroll, they just mockingbird.
[00:07:14.294 --> 00:07:20.158]  That's why it's called Operation Mockingbird, because you have a few big boys say it, and all the parrots, they repeat it, like a mockingbird.
[00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:25.461]  State Bird of Texas, which copies people talking, lawnmowers, you name it.
[00:07:25.681 --> 00:07:26.842]  That's what the general public does.
[00:07:26.882 --> 00:07:29.063]  They mockingbird what the CIA tells them.
[00:07:30.184 --> 00:07:34.607]  So I want to cover this first today, then we're going to get into the economy, which is the biggest news.
[00:07:36.269 --> 00:07:36.969]  And it's curtains.
[00:07:37.529 --> 00:07:40.850]  It's red-level emergency, and I'm totally freaking out.
[00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:41.810]  It's all I can talk about.
[00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:43.431]  My family's sick of hearing it.
[00:07:43.731 --> 00:07:45.891]  My parents' friends were visiting from Dallas.
[00:07:45.911 --> 00:07:46.991]  They were over at my house today.
[00:07:47.051 --> 00:07:49.332]  They weren't sick of hearing it, but it was depressing.
[00:07:49.772 --> 00:07:54.273]  But you might as well know you've been thrown out of an airplane, and that you've got a parachute.
[00:07:54.313 --> 00:07:56.593]  I mean, there's something everybody can do.
[00:07:56.613 --> 00:07:58.454]  So we'll break that down.
[00:07:58.474 --> 00:08:04.795]  But when we get back, talking points have been put out saying that 9-11 truthers are terrorists.
[00:08:05.211 --> 00:08:06.312]  And that we need to be put in camps.
[00:08:06.812 --> 00:08:13.535]  And magically, that flashbang grenade goes off and blows out a window, stuck in the door jam, bends a little bit of the door.
[00:08:13.555 --> 00:08:19.898]  A week and a half ago, in Times Square, at the Military Recruiting Center there, right?
[00:08:20.158 --> 00:08:22.219]  I've even protested, you know, the war there.
[00:08:23.159 --> 00:08:24.660]  It's going to be an upcoming film I've got coming out.
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:28.782]  And Geraldo Rivera comes out and he says, I think it's 9-11 truth.
[00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:30.243]  And now other channels are saying it.
[00:08:30.563 --> 00:08:33.204]  Just out of the blue, we're the ones that expose terror.
[00:08:34.082 --> 00:08:35.883]  We're the ones that have protested Geraldo Rivera.
[00:08:35.943 --> 00:08:37.584]  I was arrested protesting him in New York.
[00:08:37.985 --> 00:08:39.726]  Just blocks from the Army Recruiting Station.
[00:08:40.286 --> 00:08:43.268]  And he's now saying, I bet it's the 9-11 truthers.
[00:08:43.408 --> 00:08:44.329]  I bet they're behind it.
[00:08:44.829 --> 00:08:45.830]  Now do you see the setup?
[00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.432]  For six months they've been saying, we're gonna bomb.
[00:08:48.712 --> 00:08:49.593]  We're gonna bomb.
[00:08:49.833 --> 00:08:50.653]  We're gonna bomb.
[00:08:50.834 --> 00:08:53.475]  When we're the group that exposes the governments behind most of the bombs.
[00:08:54.236 --> 00:08:54.796]  And the attacks.
[00:08:56.177 --> 00:08:57.118]  And then suddenly,
[00:08:58.058 --> 00:09:01.361]  Geraldo Rivera and others come out and say, yes, they're behind the bomb.
[00:09:01.661 --> 00:09:04.504]  No evidence, and he says, we've been violent in the past.
[00:09:05.404 --> 00:09:08.287]  No 9-11 truth group has ever been violent.
[00:09:09.548 --> 00:09:09.828]  Ever.
[00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.652]  A man, a week and a half ago in Corpus Christi, Texas.
[00:09:15.973 --> 00:09:17.495]  I guess it was a week and a half ago, it was last Monday.
[00:09:17.835 --> 00:09:20.177]  Clinton was down there, proselytizing for Hillary.
[00:09:20.237 --> 00:09:24.020]  The guy stands up at a public event across the street and says 9-11 is an inside job.
[00:09:25.061 --> 00:09:25.662]  They arrest him.
[00:09:27.729 --> 00:09:32.190]  And MSNBC says, torture him, put him in a secret camp.
[00:09:34.171 --> 00:09:36.411]  They say put anyone who disagrees with the government in a camp.
[00:09:37.011 --> 00:09:38.752]  That is not the American way, scum!
[00:09:39.332 --> 00:09:44.973]  The people saying that are enemies, they're on government payroll, this is not our government, we've been hijacked by foreign banks, we'll be right back.
[00:09:45.234 --> 00:09:45.734]  Stay with me.
[00:10:01.175 --> 00:10:02.576]  It is a big idea.
[00:10:02.596 --> 00:10:04.697]  A New World Order.
[00:10:05.417 --> 00:10:09.639]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.481]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:10:13.121 --> 00:10:15.342]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:10:15.923 --> 00:10:18.344]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:10:19.104 --> 00:10:26.448]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:10:29.449 --> 00:10:34.432]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:10:34.772 --> 00:10:38.354]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:10:38.774 --> 00:10:41.275]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[00:10:41.315 --> 00:10:42.456]  Most people have no idea.
[00:10:42.476 --> 00:10:43.276]  They're not after money.
[00:10:43.296 --> 00:10:44.357]  They have all the money they need.
[00:10:44.537 --> 00:10:45.277]  They're after power.
[00:10:45.538 --> 00:10:46.378]  That's what they're after.

[00:10:55.022 --> 00:10:57.704]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:10:58.184 --> 00:10:59.365]  You have been warned.
[00:11:16.064 --> 00:11:21.830]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:26.054]  Treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing the Yen Revolution.
[00:11:26.354 --> 00:11:34.522]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[00:11:34.542 --> 00:11:37.045]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[00:11:37.305 --> 00:11:41.048]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[00:11:41.228 --> 00:11:47.413]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published a report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.
[00:11:47.733 --> 00:11:49.074]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[00:11:51.156 --> 00:11:54.198]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in the global game of chess.
[00:11:54.298 --> 00:11:54.638]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:11:54.658 --> 00:11:54.999]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:12:01.949 --> 00:12:02.429]  Hi, neighbor.
[00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:05.472]  They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[00:12:06.052 --> 00:12:10.775]  Certainly we'd never intend to procrastinate getting our own food supply until there was none left at any price.
[00:12:11.336 --> 00:12:16.459]  We would intend to have plenty of food so the relief organizations could care for those unable to care for themselves.
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:24.165]  We would intend not to be standing in the breadline with the ignorant and the foolish who pretend the facts of food disappearance are untrue.
[00:12:24.685 --> 00:12:29.569]  If the experience of the Katrina disaster is evidence, the breadline may have no bread.
[00:12:30.189 --> 00:12:37.232]  Just like the good intentions on the road to that unheavenly place, the good intentions alone to get a supply of food will not feed us.
[00:12:38.012 --> 00:12:42.434]  Only getting our food supply immediately will make us independent and fearless for the future.
[00:12:42.454 --> 00:12:43.414]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:12:43.434 --> 00:12:43.474]  800-409-5633.
[00:12:43.494 --> 00:12:44.455]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[00:12:44.495 --> 00:12:44.795]  Who am I?
[00:12:44.815 --> 00:12:44.935]  Nobody.
[00:12:44.955 --> 00:12:45.575]  Steve Schenk.
[00:12:45.595 --> 00:12:46.095]  Someone who cares.
[00:13:02.739 --> 00:13:03.380]  It's a fact.
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:11.086]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:13:11.206 --> 00:13:20.073]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[00:13:20.353 --> 00:13:30.901]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:13:31.141 --> 00:13:37.205]  We can terminate your unsecure debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[00:13:37.425 --> 00:13:42.449]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:47.112]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[00:13:47.272 --> 00:13:49.073]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[00:13:49.133 --> 00:13:49.393]  That's 877-943-8600.
[00:13:49.413 --> 00:13:49.834]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[00:13:49.934 --> 00:13:51.815]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[00:13:51.855 --> 00:13:52.235]  Visit FDRS.org.
[00:14:01.861 --> 00:14:06.344]  Are you tired of searching for great talk radio?
[00:14:06.424 --> 00:14:07.624]  Well, search no more.
[00:14:07.704 --> 00:14:09.926]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:14:13.827 --> 00:14:18.110]  Alright, my friends, we're back live here.
[00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:22.672]  Coming up, USA Today tells you something we've been telling you for decades.
[00:14:23.452 --> 00:14:25.934]  Right now, feds might be looking into your finances.
[00:14:25.994 --> 00:14:26.754]  No warrant.
[00:14:27.154 --> 00:14:28.535]  Guilty until proven innocent.
[00:14:29.811 --> 00:14:34.420]  17 million Americans last year had the government randomly look at your bank account.
[00:14:34.601 --> 00:14:35.683]  No judge, no jury.
[00:14:36.084 --> 00:14:37.206]  Welcome to the slave pit.
[00:14:38.429 --> 00:14:43.730]  Also, the National News is reporting that the government's using your cell phones, even when they're off, to listen to you.
[00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:45.090]  I'm going to give you the rest of the story.
[00:14:45.691 --> 00:14:50.772]  Also, law enforcement wields tougher intel networks, merging local police under federal control.
[00:14:50.832 --> 00:14:52.632]  Washington Technology Magazine.
[00:14:53.152 --> 00:14:58.293]  Also, city police to get access to school cameras, watching your children, live time, even in the bathrooms.
[00:14:58.313 --> 00:14:58.813]  Again, 1984.
[00:14:58.973 --> 00:14:59.373]  Land of the Slave.
[00:15:02.734 --> 00:15:03.874]  Home of the people that aren't free.
[00:15:03.914 --> 00:15:05.215]  That's what our country is now known as.
[00:15:05.555 --> 00:15:10.556]  Senate bill proposes to screen and medicate mothers, saying that pregnancy is now a mental illness.
[00:15:11.137 --> 00:15:11.757]  Mother's Act.
[00:15:11.797 --> 00:15:12.977]  Pregnancy is a mental illness.
[00:15:12.997 --> 00:15:13.918]  We'll be going over that.
[00:15:14.838 --> 00:15:19.879]  The Supreme Court to hear an argument for national gun ban.
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.820]  And they're going to rule for gun control.
[00:15:22.651 --> 00:15:23.251]  Just watch.
[00:15:23.471 --> 00:15:24.752]  And so we'll get to that.
[00:15:24.992 --> 00:15:26.032]  And I'll be called an enemy.
[00:15:26.412 --> 00:15:30.913]  They'll probably go on TV and say, anybody that's against getting rid of the Second Amendment needs to be put in a camp.
[00:15:31.113 --> 00:15:32.954]  People will say, absolutely!
[00:15:33.014 --> 00:15:33.814]  Put them in a camp!
[00:15:33.854 --> 00:15:34.634]  That's freedom!
[00:15:35.314 --> 00:15:35.894]  A D.C.
[00:15:35.954 --> 00:15:37.855]  gun ban gets a day in court.
[00:15:39.135 --> 00:15:43.376]  And if they rule for it, that means gun control nationwide, because there's an absolute gun ban in D.C.
[00:15:44.376 --> 00:15:48.777]  Louisiana City wants to require surveillance cameras in homes and businesses.
[00:15:48.797 --> 00:15:50.998]  Again, you can't make this type of stuff up.
[00:15:52.098 --> 00:15:55.060]  Our government's defending China, mass slaughtering people in Tibet.
[00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:58.601]  They're on their western border.
[00:16:00.122 --> 00:16:02.763]  Tibet taken over in the late 40s by the Chinese.
[00:16:02.803 --> 00:16:06.464]  They forced Chinese women, Tibetan women, to marry Chinese men.
[00:16:06.985 --> 00:16:08.505]  Absolute genocide of that culture.
[00:16:08.545 --> 00:16:11.046]  And our government says, hey, we're not going to boycott the Olympics.
[00:16:11.507 --> 00:16:12.147]  We're all for it.
[00:16:12.187 --> 00:16:14.388]  Just absolutely disgusting and sick.
[00:16:14.992 --> 00:16:16.653]  So that's in the police state stack.
[00:16:16.713 --> 00:16:19.034]  I'm going to get into more detail on some of those.
[00:16:19.534 --> 00:16:22.035]  In the economy stack, weak dollar cost U.S.
[00:16:22.075 --> 00:16:22.555]  economy.
[00:16:22.616 --> 00:16:23.536]  It's number one spot.
[00:16:23.796 --> 00:16:25.637]  Yeah, we're no longer the biggest economy in the world.
[00:16:26.037 --> 00:16:29.759]  Of course, that number really flipped about two years ago, but they're just now getting around to telling you.
[00:16:29.979 --> 00:16:32.020]  We're about to be the number three spot behind China.
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.581]  It's the euro, then China, then the U.S.
[00:16:35.433 --> 00:16:38.615]  We're actually number three about a year ago, but again, they'll tell you soon.
[00:16:39.115 --> 00:16:40.836]  You'll hear it in the next few months.
[00:16:40.876 --> 00:16:42.077]  Weak dollar cost U.S.
[00:16:42.117 --> 00:16:43.258]  economy's number one spot.
[00:16:43.278 --> 00:16:46.840]  We're now behind the Euro and about to be behind the Chinese.
[00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:49.762]  Fears for world economy as major U.S.
[00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:50.802]  bank bailed out.
[00:16:51.543 --> 00:16:52.443]  Here's another headline.
[00:16:52.483 --> 00:16:54.905]  Wall Street fears for next Great Depression.
[00:16:55.385 --> 00:16:57.386]  And they say they believe we're going to have a Great Depression.
[00:16:57.426 --> 00:16:58.287]  That's the Independent.
[00:16:59.066 --> 00:17:02.208]  Uh, Goldman Sachs, these explosive commodity rallies.
[00:17:02.228 --> 00:17:02.869]  $175 a barrel oil.
[00:17:02.889 --> 00:17:03.830]  It's already $111 a barrel.
[00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:04.710]  Gold above $1,010.
[00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:05.551]  Closing out on Friday.
[00:17:05.571 --> 00:17:06.472]  Bear Stearns weekend talks.
[00:17:13.172 --> 00:17:18.154]  If somebody doesn't bail out Bear Stearns tomorrow morning, you're going to see a whole bunch of banks go under in brokerage firms.
[00:17:19.034 --> 00:17:24.455]  President Bush's, it's the Queen of England, the Bin Laden's and the Bush's are the majority owners in Carlisle.
[00:17:24.556 --> 00:17:26.196]  I'm not kidding, you can't make that stuff up.
[00:17:26.696 --> 00:17:27.316]  Go look it up.
[00:17:27.616 --> 00:17:28.597]  It's about to go under.
[00:17:29.017 --> 00:17:30.377]  It's missed two margin calls.
[00:17:30.397 --> 00:17:33.298]  If you don't know what margin calls are, folks, you better find out.
[00:17:34.178 --> 00:17:35.159]  They're fully leveraged.
[00:17:36.099 --> 00:17:39.200]  Bernanke discards monetary history with Bear Stearns' bailout.
[00:17:40.856 --> 00:17:42.237]  The road to hyperinflation.
[00:17:42.297 --> 00:17:43.297]  We're going to go over all that.
[00:17:43.337 --> 00:17:45.538]  Now, I've got all this news I want to cover.
[00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:51.941]  And I know we've got Barbara in Memphis, and Ryan in Illinois, and Mark in Georgia, and Chris in Minnesota, and Ted in Texas.
[00:17:52.201 --> 00:17:53.182]  I'm going to get to all of you.
[00:17:53.202 --> 00:17:55.523]  Last weekend, last Sunday, I mainly just took calls.
[00:17:55.563 --> 00:17:57.403]  But I've got to cover this news.
[00:17:57.423 --> 00:17:58.164]  So here's what I'm going to do.
[00:17:59.184 --> 00:18:01.745]  I'm going to quickly cover this 9-11 police state news.
[00:18:01.885 --> 00:18:03.366]  Then I'm going to come back, take calls.
[00:18:03.486 --> 00:18:07.588]  Then I'm going to get into weak dollar, and what's happening to the economy, the long and short of it.
[00:18:08.679 --> 00:18:10.821]  And then I'm going to get into the police state.
[00:18:10.861 --> 00:18:12.903]  This is going to be a totally jam-packed show.
[00:18:13.363 --> 00:18:14.364]  I am focused today.
[00:18:15.065 --> 00:18:15.365]  Okay.
[00:18:17.427 --> 00:18:26.054]  Right now, let's just go ahead and get back into the scripted government orders to all major cable news networks to call for the arrest
[00:18:26.724 --> 00:18:34.736]  And to call for the incarceration, to call for the torture with tasers, the beating to a pulp, these are all quotes, the killing, the putting in camps.
[00:18:34.816 --> 00:18:38.021]  Now, there are literally hundreds of these clips I've seen in the last six months.
[00:18:38.421 --> 00:18:43.028]  Here is just one of the latest, this last week, MSNBC, The Morning Joe.
[00:18:43.925 --> 00:18:47.708]  Senator Clinton's husband has had his share of fainting audience members lately.
[00:18:48.108 --> 00:18:51.530]  But yesterday it was a screaming audience member who got Bill's attention.
[00:18:51.991 --> 00:19:00.277]  President Clinton was campaigning for his wife in Corpus Christi, Texas yesterday when an idiot started waving a sign that claimed 9-11 was an inside job.
[00:19:00.417 --> 00:19:00.837]  Shut up.
[00:19:01.137 --> 00:19:03.859]  He was working the crowd after the speech.
[00:19:03.899 --> 00:19:05.881]  What's Roger O'Donnell doing in Corpus Christi?
[00:19:06.461 --> 00:19:09.483]  The man got close to the former president and started yelling at him.
[00:19:09.543 --> 00:19:10.764]  You don't do that, you see.
[00:19:10.944 --> 00:19:11.945]  Stop right there.
[00:19:12.385 --> 00:19:12.986]  Stop right there.
[00:19:13.684 --> 00:19:15.285]  See, you have to analyze each line.
[00:19:15.446 --> 00:19:19.209]  You know, I actually talked to the Corpus Christi Caller-Times reporter.
[00:19:19.789 --> 00:19:23.292]  I saw the AP and the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, and they both said the same thing.
[00:19:23.652 --> 00:19:38.625]  Clinton was leaving the event, the guy was standing across the street, on a city sidewalk, in Corpus Christi, with his sign, saying 9-11 was an inside job, and the AP, not the CIA and SNBC,
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:20:08.472]  And the Morning Joe, but the AP and the Corpus Christi Caller Times and the reporter I talked to said the man was standing there yelling 9-11 is an inside job, his first amendment right, and the Secret Service didn't come over, citizens ran over, Clinton supporters with Clinton signs, and grabbed him, hit him, pulled away his sign, ripped it in half, and then Corpus Christi PD came over and arrested the man for disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace and took him to jail, just like Nazi Germany.
[00:20:09.565 --> 00:20:11.006]  The street thugs would beat you up.
[00:20:11.307 --> 00:20:12.167]  They work for Hitler.
[00:20:12.548 --> 00:20:13.488]  And then the S.A.
[00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:15.430]  would come and arrest you and take you to jail.
[00:20:16.951 --> 00:20:20.354]  And even the Corpus Christi paper said this shouldn't have happened to this man.
[00:20:20.394 --> 00:20:21.235]  It's his First Amendment.
[00:20:21.275 --> 00:20:28.480]  Now, every time we get our rights violated, we're losing our First Amendment, the media nationally lies, though.
[00:20:29.681 --> 00:20:34.005]  And says, oh, he got in Clinton's face at an event and yelled at him up close.
[00:20:34.345 --> 00:20:35.526]  Total bull!
[00:20:35.866 --> 00:20:36.087]  A.P.
[00:20:38.132 --> 00:20:39.374]  And Corpus Christi Caller Times.
[00:20:39.394 --> 00:20:40.897]  See, the government doesn't control the whole media.
[00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:43.301]  They control what you end up seeing on the nightly news.
[00:20:43.882 --> 00:20:46.306]  The four or five stories, not the hundreds we scan.
[00:20:46.827 --> 00:20:51.615]  So, two separate publications, and I couldn't look for more, but that was documented, told the exact same story.
[00:20:53.999 --> 00:20:59.424]  Bill Clinton is leaving the event, the guys across the street with a 9-11's and Inside Jobs sign, they come over.
[00:20:59.624 --> 00:21:00.365]  Now they're not done.
[00:21:00.625 --> 00:21:06.990]  Now they say he needs to, on the newscast, go back to it, after they're done, first dehumanizing him, lying, saying he deserves it.
[00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:19.481]  After slandering him, after libeling him, after defaming him, after setting him up and lying about him, and saying the Secret Service did this and he threatened the President and all this bull, they then,
[00:21:20.322 --> 00:21:21.983]  Say, put him in a camp.
[00:21:22.323 --> 00:21:22.764]  Taser him.
[00:21:22.804 --> 00:21:23.204]  Torture him.
[00:21:23.244 --> 00:21:23.544]  Here it is.
[00:21:46.938 --> 00:21:49.480]  Did you hear three of them say, put them in a camp?
[00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:50.641]  It was all a talking point.
[00:21:51.501 --> 00:21:53.543]  Put them in a camp, put them in a camp, put them in a camp.
[00:21:53.563 --> 00:21:54.704]  Those are all parts of the show.
[00:21:55.504 --> 00:21:57.566]  Taserine, put them all in camps together.
[00:21:58.366 --> 00:21:59.727]  Now, folks, I could play clip after clip.
[00:21:59.747 --> 00:22:00.648]  We don't have time to do it.
[00:22:00.888 --> 00:22:02.449]  We've written articles full of these clips.
[00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:07.833]  It's all, uh, what did, in show after show, Glenn Beck posing as a conservative.
[00:22:08.113 --> 00:22:09.674]  He'll talk about a lot of issues that are true.
[00:22:09.935 --> 00:22:10.155]  U.N.
[00:22:10.195 --> 00:22:11.055]  takeover, all of it.
[00:22:11.256 --> 00:22:13.097]  But he won't then defend the First Amendment.
[00:22:13.883 --> 00:22:17.706]  He said, we're terrorists, we work with McVeigh, we're going to bomb people.
[00:22:18.367 --> 00:22:21.529]  He said, we need to be arrested, the military needs to be used against us.
[00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:27.874]  Now we get back, I'll play Geraldo Rivera, after all this scripting, there's been a tiny bombing, guaranteed the government.
[00:22:28.955 --> 00:22:30.937]  Or they'll have some young provocateur they hired.
[00:22:31.457 --> 00:22:33.039]  For not his handlers, government always is.
[00:22:33.659 --> 00:22:35.180]  And now they're saying, see?
[00:22:35.481 --> 00:22:36.862]  They're behind it with no evidence.
[00:22:38.083 --> 00:22:43.147]  You see, we're going to come back, finish up with this, then go to your phone calls, then the economic news,
[00:22:44.051 --> 00:22:45.133]  Then the police state news.
[00:22:45.233 --> 00:22:48.379]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com are the websites.
[00:22:48.539 --> 00:22:49.601]  We're defending the Republic.
[00:22:50.002 --> 00:22:50.663]  It's under attack.
[00:22:50.683 --> 00:22:51.745]  The country's falling right now.
[00:23:00.658 --> 00:23:01.278]  J.W.
[00:23:01.319 --> 00:23:04.381]  Labs has been building Rife machines for over 20 years.

[00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:24.954]  Priced under $1,000, Model A is a state-of-the-art device which performs better than machines costing several times more.
[00:23:25.295 --> 00:23:30.518]  With Model A, you have enough power to treat a horse, yet enough sensitivity to treat a mouse.
[00:23:30.998 --> 00:23:33.799]  It's ideal for local and whole body applications.

[00:24:00.902 --> 00:24:05.666]  If your body isn't feeling too well these days, you're gonna start taking this hemp I say.
[00:24:05.726 --> 00:24:09.389]  Go to hempusa.org.
[00:24:10.931 --> 00:24:15.375]  You may not like what I'm about to say, but you know I'm gonna say it anyway.
[00:24:15.715 --> 00:24:17.817]  The government doesn't want the best for you.
[00:24:18.177 --> 00:24:23.502]  They keep you down, they keep you blue, they starve your body for all its nutrients.
[00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:27.591]  They won't let you grow industrial hemp.
[00:24:27.971 --> 00:24:33.352]  It really doesn't make any kind of sense when it's so healthy for the world and useful for you, my friends.
[00:24:35.273 --> 00:24:39.814]  I hope Mr. Bush will hear this song, for the heart of America wants this one.
[00:24:39.834 --> 00:24:43.115]  Go to hempusa.org.
[00:24:44.676 --> 00:24:49.557]  If you're a truther, an anarchist, a renegade, you only want things that God has made.
[00:24:49.637 --> 00:24:50.417]  Go to hempusa.org.
[00:24:54.111 --> 00:24:56.252]  We offer free shipping anywhere in the states!
[00:24:56.333 --> 00:24:59.515]  Go to hempusa.org!
[00:25:00.735 --> 00:25:02.416]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:25:02.737 --> 00:25:06.199]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:25:06.359 --> 00:25:08.220]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.562]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:25:11.883 --> 00:25:17.366]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:25:17.666 --> 00:25:21.609]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:25:21.929 --> 00:25:26.853]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[00:25:27.153 --> 00:25:29.936]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[00:25:51.213 --> 00:25:52.854]  Join PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:25:53.294 --> 00:25:55.075]  Burn the info bombs to dust.
[00:25:55.275 --> 00:25:57.117]  Put them on the file sharing networks.

[00:25:59.238 --> 00:25:59.979]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:26:01.858 --> 00:26:03.599]  Ladies and gentlemen, please pay attention.
[00:26:03.839 --> 00:26:05.120]  Ron Paul did not quit.
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.341]  He is still in the race.
[00:26:06.701 --> 00:26:09.983]  Most Americans do not understand how the election process works.
[00:26:10.423 --> 00:26:11.464]  The media is lying.
[00:26:11.924 --> 00:26:14.485]  John McCain does not have the Republican nomination.
[00:26:14.866 --> 00:26:17.587]  The popular vote is just a straw poll, believe it or not.
[00:26:17.987 --> 00:26:21.189]  The delegates have the power over the elections, not the voters.
[00:26:21.589 --> 00:26:25.892]  After the mainstream media wrote a hit piece on how Ron Paul quit, many supporters quit as well.
[00:26:26.512 --> 00:26:31.415]  Ron Paul has stated he will continue his run for presidency as long as he has your continued support.
[00:26:31.876 --> 00:26:32.916]  Ron Paul has a plan.
[00:26:33.197 --> 00:26:39.481]  The delegates have not yet been voted on and they are voted first in county, then state, all the way to the National Convention.
[00:26:39.941 --> 00:26:44.404]  Go to our website at RonPaulFlags.com and click on why Ron Paul will win.
[00:26:44.924 --> 00:26:48.387]  That's RonPaulFlags.com to find out more on how delegates work.
[00:26:48.827 --> 00:26:49.568]  Stand your ground.
[00:26:49.688 --> 00:26:53.210]  Go for the win and fly a Ron Paul flag today or call 731-664-1526 for more information.
[00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:53.651]  That's 731-664-1526.
[00:26:53.671 --> 00:26:55.212]  Thank you for listening to GPN.
[00:26:55.252 --> 00:26:56.153]  Visit GPNlive.com today.
[00:27:20.445 --> 00:27:21.886]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:21.906 --> 00:27:24.008]  We're going to go straight to your calls here in just a moment.
[00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:37.300]  But first, I want to finish up with the Globalists that staged the attacks of 9-11, panicking, and having their frontmen, their minions, that are bleeding out all credibility they had left.
[00:27:38.303 --> 00:27:52.172]  As they try to claim that 9-11 Truth, the organization, the group, the grassroots, that exposes the black ops from the military industrial complex, it exposes global corporations, aiding terrorists, staging events, there's a mix of different things that happen.
[00:27:52.192 --> 00:28:00.418]  They fund some real terrorists, other times they enable, they open the door for them, they protect them, and in some cases they actually stage the events themselves, the big spectacular ones.
[00:28:01.287 --> 00:28:02.588]  And that's just the fact.
[00:28:02.649 --> 00:28:04.010]  So here's Geraldo Rivera.
[00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:13.179]  They're talking earlier this week on Fox about the bombing with a little cherry bomb, a little flashbang that blew out a window of the Army Recruiting Center.
[00:28:13.199 --> 00:28:18.144]  And they say it looks like a copycat or looks like it's a serial bomber because the same thing happened
[00:28:19.004 --> 00:28:21.826]  In London, same thing happened here, to this embassy, that embassy.
[00:28:22.267 --> 00:28:25.249]  London, the British have been caught bombing their own embassies.
[00:28:25.509 --> 00:28:27.470]  The Israelis have with flashbangs.
[00:28:27.831 --> 00:28:31.873]  And they quote, do it, it always comes out years later, to get more security.
[00:28:32.834 --> 00:28:34.495]  So that's also declassified.
[00:28:35.256 --> 00:28:36.637]  And that's when they get caught.
[00:28:36.657 --> 00:28:42.861]  They say, okay, we did stage a bombing on ourselves, a small one, to get more security and make the embassy staff pay attention.
[00:28:43.627 --> 00:28:47.931]  So, so, they're pointing out there's always these flashbangs that the military and police have.
[00:28:48.171 --> 00:28:53.015]  And they just jam one in there and they may grab some zit-faced schizophrenic kid and have him say he did it.
[00:28:53.355 --> 00:28:54.376]  That's their favorite M.O.
[00:28:54.856 --> 00:28:57.118]  But, uh, there's no connection to 9-11 truth.
[00:28:57.358 --> 00:29:01.441]  Nobody's saying that but the operatives on television.
[00:29:01.481 --> 00:29:01.882]  Here he is.
[00:29:02.901 --> 00:29:18.077]  What happened on 42nd Street, right in Times Square, and it happened about 3.40 in the morning, over 24 hours ago, and Geraldo, I don't know if you saw the press conference yesterday, here's a little of it, as Mike Bloomberg sat there with the New York Police Commissioner talking about what happened.
[00:29:20.319 --> 00:29:29.363]  Whoever the coward was that committed this disgraceful act on our city will be found and prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
[00:29:30.003 --> 00:29:39.247]  We will not tolerate such attacks, nor will we let them destroy our freedom to live peacefully and safely in the greatest city of the world.
[00:29:40.482 --> 00:29:41.223]  All right, Geraldo.
[00:29:43.225 --> 00:29:45.748]  Extraordinarily, yesterday this happened.
[00:29:45.988 --> 00:29:48.651]  Then these manifestos pop up on Capitol Hill.
[00:29:49.132 --> 00:29:57.021]  Apparently this guy out in Los Angeles, David Carn, picked the wrong day to put it in the mail because they've already figured out this guy in LA
[00:29:57.521 --> 00:29:57.942]  No, I don't.
[00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:19.887]  This particular recruiting center has been the scene of demonstrations for decades.
[00:30:20.047 --> 00:30:33.103]  I remember during my day in the Vietnam era, that same, you know, it's right in the middle of Times Square, it's perfectly located, so it is where, you know, it's like a magnet for these crazy people, for anarchists.
[00:30:33.972 --> 00:30:35.553]  That's what I think this is.
[00:30:35.853 --> 00:30:39.455]  I think that this bomber isn't Al-Qaeda, isn't anything like that.
[00:30:39.755 --> 00:30:45.658]  He's more like, it's a man, he's more like those 9-11-was-an-inside-job kind of guys.
[00:30:45.718 --> 00:30:53.662]  They're protesting in a violent way, but in a violent way almost like the eco-terrorists, where they don't intend to inflict casualties.
[00:30:54.122 --> 00:30:55.202]  Back it up 20 seconds.
[00:30:55.823 --> 00:30:56.643]  Did you hear that?
[00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:09.607]  First, he says, and that's why they're on television, that's why the CIA pays them, and it's come out, the White House paid $1.8 billion in fake news to Fox and others in 2006 alone.
[00:31:10.028 --> 00:31:12.289]  Congress said it was illegal, and they said, we're going to keep doing it.
[00:31:12.369 --> 00:31:18.913]  Just fake news, paying reporters, buying them off, paying for fake news, not just fake newscasts that aired on stations around the country.
[00:31:19.894 --> 00:31:24.257]  And I told you Tommy Franks was on government payroll the year after he left
[00:31:25.385 --> 00:31:31.669]  As the head of the Iraq operations, because he would go on the news channel and say, Marshall Law is what the people want.
[00:31:31.829 --> 00:31:37.092]  I'm sad to say it, but one more attack will set aside the Constitution for military form of government.
[00:31:37.593 --> 00:31:40.114]  And I saw him all over TV saying that, and I said, that guy's on the payroll.
[00:31:40.835 --> 00:31:49.320]  And it later came out, he was getting $500,000 a year to just go give speeches saying Marshall Law is what we need.
[00:31:51.886 --> 00:31:53.026]  I mean, that ought to chill you!
[00:31:53.346 --> 00:31:57.828]  The government's paying top military brass to go around saying martial law is what we need?
[00:31:58.189 --> 00:32:02.290]  And listen, the martial law isn't going to be aimed at the Arabs or the Muslims living in this country.
[00:32:02.311 --> 00:32:13.696]  It's not going to be aimed at... It's going to be aimed at people who have millions of dollars of stocks taken or pension funds, because when hundreds of companies do like Enron did, and you get real angry and upset, they're just going to arrest you.
[00:32:14.236 --> 00:32:15.037]  See, that's what this is.
[00:32:15.137 --> 00:32:20.079]  This is about you, who love the system, who don't understand that our country's been hijacked and taken over.
[00:32:20.825 --> 00:32:22.626]  Okay, this is for you, Bubba.
[00:32:23.167 --> 00:32:25.268]  You, who are in the Marine Corps, or the Army.
[00:32:25.488 --> 00:32:26.869]  You, who own a car dealership.
[00:32:27.109 --> 00:32:29.110]  You, who own $50 million in stocks.
[00:32:29.471 --> 00:32:30.872]  This is for you, Jack!
[00:32:31.672 --> 00:32:32.673]  Okay, do you understand that?
[00:32:32.733 --> 00:32:34.834]  Our government runs the Al-Qaeda Wahhabist.
[00:32:35.254 --> 00:32:36.675]  And they'll use them whenever they need them.
[00:32:36.855 --> 00:32:37.856]  And they'll never be stopped.
[00:32:37.896 --> 00:32:39.197]  Because they were created by the British.
[00:32:40.618 --> 00:32:43.699]  You better learn the intel, you better find out the game that's being played here.
[00:32:43.899 --> 00:32:47.240]  Now, do you notice he says 9-11 Truth, they're violent.
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:48.740]  They do violent things.
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.521]  We've never done anything violent, ever.
[00:32:50.941 --> 00:32:53.661]  He just lies, just like they said the other guy threatened Clinton.
[00:32:53.942 --> 00:32:54.522]  Total lie.
[00:32:55.102 --> 00:32:58.023]  See, they lie here and say, well, you know, they're violent.
[00:32:58.043 --> 00:33:00.343]  This is what these violent 9-11 Truth groups do.
[00:33:01.343 --> 00:33:03.604]  So he says, we do violent things.
[00:33:03.644 --> 00:33:04.504]  He just lies.
[00:33:04.824 --> 00:33:06.965]  And then says we're responsible for a bombing.
[00:33:07.617 --> 00:33:08.559]  The government's behind it!
[00:33:08.639 --> 00:33:09.481]  Guaranteed, folks!
[00:33:09.642 --> 00:33:12.007]  When the talking point people start saying it, it's over.
[00:33:12.227 --> 00:33:12.788]  Back to him.
[00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:17.479]  It's like a magnet for these crazy people who are anarchists.
[00:33:18.512 --> 00:33:19.433]  That's what I think this is.
[00:33:19.573 --> 00:33:23.875]  I think that this bomber isn't Al-Qaeda, isn't anything like that.
[00:33:24.175 --> 00:33:30.298]  He's more like, it's a man, he's more like those 9-11-was-an-inside-job kind of guys.
[00:33:30.578 --> 00:33:36.761]  They're protesting in a violent way, but in a violent way almost like the eco-terrorists, but they don't intend to.
[00:33:36.781 --> 00:33:37.481]  Okay, stop it again.
[00:33:37.661 --> 00:33:43.944]  The eco-terrorists have burned down hundreds of ski resorts, burned down car dealerships, attacked everybody.
[00:33:46.406 --> 00:34:00.174]  And he's saying that 9-11 truth groups, former German defense ministers, former Italian president, former CIA section chiefs, thousands of physicists and scientists and engineers, and all these peaceful people, we've never done anything violent.
[00:34:01.615 --> 00:34:14.943]  And remember when Silverstein's goons, with We Are Change in New York, when they're protesting out front his building at the little square there, city property, they walk up and the former police, who were his security guards, say, Larry Silverstein doesn't want you here.
[00:34:15.703 --> 00:34:20.864]  And then they go forward and they say, we're going to say you have bombs, and we're going to frame you and put you in jail.
[00:34:21.704 --> 00:34:24.825]  And they're doing it while Luke Radowsky and them are videotaping.
[00:34:24.965 --> 00:34:27.266]  Then the cops show up and try to grab the video camera.
[00:34:27.286 --> 00:34:30.947]  They steal it, but then are forced to give it back when other higher-level police get there.
[00:34:31.647 --> 00:34:33.787]  Luke would have been gone, folks, on the news as a terrorist.
[00:34:34.147 --> 00:34:35.288]  We're being set up.
[00:34:35.328 --> 00:34:36.188]  You need to understand that.
[00:34:36.914 --> 00:34:37.675]  And it's not going to work.
[00:34:37.715 --> 00:34:38.355]  It's not going to fly.
[00:34:38.415 --> 00:34:40.096]  We're the group that exposes violence.
[00:34:40.397 --> 00:34:41.858]  We're the group that's against violence.
[00:34:42.278 --> 00:34:45.540]  We are a lone wolf organization of just ideas.
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:46.321]  You can't stop us.
[00:34:46.861 --> 00:34:47.662]  And you're not going to stop us.
[00:34:47.682 --> 00:34:48.882]  We're going to continue to expose.
[00:34:49.143 --> 00:34:49.923]  It's an inside job.
[00:34:49.943 --> 00:34:50.784]  There's nothing you can do.
[00:34:51.805 --> 00:34:53.366]  So you hear him say we're violent.
[00:34:53.706 --> 00:34:55.627]  And then that he thinks we're behind the bombing.
[00:34:56.468 --> 00:34:57.989]  Never involved in any violence.
[00:34:58.890 --> 00:35:02.392]  And then he goes forward and says we're involved in the bombing.
[00:35:02.972 --> 00:35:07.195]  And then he says, we are like the eco-terrorists that have burned down all these things.
[00:35:08.616 --> 00:35:18.103]  Who spike all these trees, and people are chainsawing through a redwood, and they hit a big spike, and the chain slaps off, and slices their carotid artery, and blood spews everywhere.
[00:35:19.203 --> 00:35:20.344]  Totally different group!
[00:35:20.884 --> 00:35:24.367]  We're not the group busting into the animal research laboratories.
[00:35:25.027 --> 00:35:31.792]  Look, they know the public so dumb down, though, that they talk to you, and they treat you like two-year-olds.
[00:35:33.442 --> 00:35:42.330]  And they just blur it all together with skill, just like the fella down, the AP gets it right, the Corpus Christi Caller Times gets it right, go pull it up yourself!
[00:35:42.830 --> 00:36:01.706]  So the guy was peaceably standing on the side of the street, across when Bill Clinton came out and began shouting from across the street, 9-11's an inside job, he was assaulted by the Clintonoids, cousins to the hemorrhoids, you know, they come rushing across, they start hitting him with signs, doing what they do, as mindless commies, that's what they are,
[00:36:02.645 --> 00:36:05.566]  Just idiots, just like neocon followers are idiots.
[00:36:05.726 --> 00:36:06.826]  They all work for the same people.
[00:36:06.986 --> 00:36:08.766]  They have moron robot followers.
[00:36:09.006 --> 00:36:10.507]  They came over and hit him!
[00:36:10.827 --> 00:36:14.267]  And attack him, and grab his sign away, and the cops come arrest him!
[00:36:14.648 --> 00:36:22.909]  And then National News demonizes this great American for engaging in his First Amendment, and say, send him to a camp!
[00:36:23.649 --> 00:36:25.250]  Isn't it enough he was falsely arrested?
[00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:27.890]  Remember the guy who asked Kerry about Skull and Bones membership?
[00:36:29.131 --> 00:36:31.051]  And then they come hold him down, the police hold him down.
[00:36:32.114 --> 00:36:33.656]  He's got his hands, and he's not even resisting.
[00:36:33.676 --> 00:36:34.817]  He goes, don't tase me, bro.
[00:36:35.138 --> 00:36:36.740]  And the cop just starts tasing him.
[00:36:37.741 --> 00:36:42.687]  And all these videos are coming out of them having retarded kids and stuff, and handcuffs on their backs, tasering them.
[00:36:43.087 --> 00:36:44.288]  And people didn't defend that.
[00:36:44.489 --> 00:36:49.675]  They just beat some Navy veteran to death, and the cops are coming out defending him, when all the witnesses said he didn't even resist.
[00:36:49.855 --> 00:36:50.636]  They beat him to death.
[00:36:52.654 --> 00:36:54.516]  And if you defend that, that's what we've become!
[00:36:54.996 --> 00:36:59.360]  We're gonna come back, go straight to Barbara, Jeremy, Mad Me, Mark, Chris, Ted, and others.
[00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:00.200]  Stay with me!
[00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:02.322]  A lot more... Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond.
[00:37:02.662 --> 00:37:08.167]  You can now get the most important package ever on what has happened to the Catholic Church in the last 50 years.
[00:37:08.647 --> 00:37:12.190]  Find out how this massive crisis concerning the Catholic Church happened.
[00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:13.151]  What happened?
[00:37:13.431 --> 00:37:13.951]  We're good to go.
[00:37:31.616 --> 00:37:32.237]  We're good.
[00:38:00.226 --> 00:38:00.767]  Hi, neighbor.
[00:38:01.087 --> 00:38:06.612]  No matter when the time comes to survive on our food supply, every single one of us who have prepared will have two regrets.
[00:38:07.233 --> 00:38:12.998]  Even those who haven't wasted a single penny on Christmas, birthdays, and vacations in order to store all the food possible.
[00:38:13.739 --> 00:38:16.982]  Even those who have sold stuff and taken on part-time jobs to buy food.
[00:38:17.643 --> 00:38:20.866]  Even those who have traded their gold while it will still buy food.
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:24.882]  Yes, we will have been called stupid, crazy and foolish.
[00:38:25.502 --> 00:38:30.004]  When folks won't be able to afford food and there won't be any food for any amount of money.
[00:38:30.704 --> 00:38:32.705]  We will still have two regrets.
[00:38:33.345 --> 00:38:36.707]  We will regret that we didn't get more serious about more food sooner.
[00:38:37.367 --> 00:38:40.269]  We will deeply regret that we didn't get enough food.
[00:38:41.029 --> 00:38:47.852]  Putting off emergency food preparations to celebrate the holidays will be the most dangerous decision that some of us will ever make.

[00:41:07.028 --> 00:41:10.310]  You're listening to the GCN Radio Network.
[00:41:12.752 --> 00:41:24.199]  The globalists are getting rid of our Bill of Rights, our Constitution, our free speech, and I forgot to really add that all I did was go to a demonstration.
[00:41:24.219 --> 00:41:27.041]  Geraldo Rivera was having a live outside TV show.
[00:41:28.582 --> 00:41:32.246]  And we did like everybody else does with signs behind him, not on Fox property.
[00:41:32.807 --> 00:41:41.035]  And on camera, we have an upcoming film, Fox Security comes out, orders the police to start arresting us because they don't like our signs and people yelling at them.
[00:41:41.496 --> 00:41:43.678]  And they came over and arrested me and took me to jail.
[00:41:44.119 --> 00:41:46.341]  That was back about four months ago.
[00:41:47.202 --> 00:41:48.043]  We were up in New York.
[00:41:49.142 --> 00:41:53.104]  And then on the Fox Newscast, you can see it on Fox News, I'm being arrested.
[00:41:53.485 --> 00:41:54.385]  He goes, there they are!
[00:41:54.425 --> 00:41:55.186]  They're violent!
[00:41:55.626 --> 00:41:56.666]  The anarchist group!
[00:41:56.706 --> 00:41:58.528]  We can take them, folks, if they attack us!
[00:41:59.108 --> 00:42:01.289]  We're being arrested for having signs!
[00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:08.173]  And then, but they know how to make, see, they can't go, we're the big bully, TV network, ordering New York police to arrest somebody.
[00:42:08.373 --> 00:42:12.115]  They have to lie and go, oh, it's gotten violent, we're arresting them!
[00:42:13.736 --> 00:42:14.557]  See how they work?
[00:42:16.458 --> 00:42:18.359]  I've been arrested on this guy's orders, folks.
[00:42:18.948 --> 00:42:20.949]  And now he's on TV saying we're bombing things!
[00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:23.771]  There's no end to these people!
[00:42:25.993 --> 00:42:31.576]  There's no end to their slander, their defamation, their lies, just like they demonized the Jews in Nazi Germany.
[00:42:31.636 --> 00:42:33.317]  It's the exact same thing.
[00:42:33.558 --> 00:42:35.399]  Well, your hoax is falling apart, criminals.
[00:42:35.419 --> 00:42:39.802]  Your WMD lies, the fact that there's a left-right paradigm, that's falling apart.
[00:42:39.842 --> 00:42:41.303]  People now know both parties are owned.
[00:42:41.723 --> 00:42:42.543]  I'm done talking about it.
[00:42:42.563 --> 00:42:45.005]  We're going to go to your calls in big financial news next hour.
[00:42:46.237 --> 00:42:48.638]  Let's go to Mark in Georgia.
[00:42:48.738 --> 00:42:49.538]  Mark, you're on the air.
[00:42:49.818 --> 00:42:50.479]  Thanks for holding.
[00:42:51.119 --> 00:42:51.439]  Hey!
[00:42:51.539 --> 00:42:52.359]  God bless you, bro.
[00:42:52.739 --> 00:42:53.580]  Everyone upstairs.
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:43:04.843]  Before I get to the thing I really called about, I'd like to think I've earned a certain measure of your trust and respect, so if I may be so bold as to offer... Well, I believe I'm... I mean, I remember you calling a few times.
[00:43:04.883 --> 00:43:05.724]  I don't know what that means.
[00:43:05.764 --> 00:43:06.664]  Just go ahead and make your point.
[00:43:07.364 --> 00:43:07.644]  Okay.
[00:43:07.704 --> 00:43:12.826]  Well, before I get to my main point, I've heard you struggle with tobacco, if I may suggest.
[00:43:13.987 --> 00:43:18.489]  Hand-rolled tobacco, rather than factory-rolled, is not going to work.
[00:43:18.509 --> 00:43:20.330]  Well, I'm off to all tobacco right now.
[00:43:20.770 --> 00:43:21.370]  God bless you.
[00:43:21.711 --> 00:43:28.013]  What I called about, I'm in the delegate process, and I hear what you're saying about if a scandal comes up.
[00:43:28.514 --> 00:43:32.035]  Well, as we know, the scandals are already there regarding McInsane.
[00:43:32.475 --> 00:43:36.117]  All we have to do is bring to light what is being suppressed.
[00:43:36.297 --> 00:43:40.559]  Now, the savings and loans scandal, the Keating Five,
[00:43:41.263 --> 00:43:58.927]  That has to do with a bank failure, and given the current economic climb and people waking up to what a fraud fractional reserve fiat banking is, that and other things, if we simply bring them to light, and basically beat Mini-Truth, the media cartel, to the punch,
[00:43:59.648 --> 00:44:02.110]  And bring these things to light, especially among the delegates.
[00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:05.872]  I've just basically been suggesting that we need... Sir, I hear you.
[00:44:05.892 --> 00:44:07.733]  This is kind of inside shop talk.
[00:44:08.194 --> 00:44:09.835]  Most Americans can't even find the U.S.
[00:44:09.895 --> 00:44:16.279]  on a map in major studies versus even understanding the electoral process, delegates, superdelegates, the way all that works.
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:19.902]  A lot of people think Ron Paul is still going to be president.
[00:44:20.422 --> 00:44:23.184]  And you've got to admire the fighting spirit, the Spartan spirit.
[00:44:24.365 --> 00:44:27.287]  But Ron Paul has said he's not going to be president.
[00:44:27.607 --> 00:44:29.188]  Ron Paul has like 60 delegates.
[00:44:29.833 --> 00:44:30.594]  We're good to go.
[00:44:47.937 --> 00:44:49.358]  It would then be the next guy.
[00:44:49.378 --> 00:44:52.320]  It would be Mitt Romney, and then it would be Huckabee, and then it would be Paul.
[00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:56.242]  Okay, please don't get mad at me, but it's over, okay?
[00:44:56.703 --> 00:44:58.724]  I mean, I live in the real world here.
[00:44:59.204 --> 00:45:04.988]  He's staying in the campaign to inject discussions and to continue to bring up issues, and that's great.
[00:45:05.228 --> 00:45:07.910]  He won his congressional seat, but it's over, okay?
[00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:09.611]  I had the congressman on Friday.
[00:45:09.791 --> 00:45:10.131]  It's over.
[00:45:12.093 --> 00:45:15.935]  And you can be mad at me if you want, and yes, something could come up.
[00:45:17.292 --> 00:45:18.793]  But it's over.
[00:45:20.093 --> 00:45:20.873]  I just gotta move quick.
[00:45:20.913 --> 00:45:21.794]  Don't be mad at me, okay?
[00:45:21.814 --> 00:45:22.934]  I really appreciate your call, sir.
[00:45:22.974 --> 00:45:25.635]  You're a nice guy, and I appreciate everything you have.
[00:45:26.475 --> 00:45:30.097]  Let's go ahead and talk to Barbara in Memphis.
[00:45:30.157 --> 00:45:30.837]  Barbara, go ahead.
[00:45:30.857 --> 00:45:33.658]  Hi, Alex.
[00:45:34.798 --> 00:45:34.838]  Hi.
[00:45:34.898 --> 00:45:45.002]  First-time caller, long-time listener, and one of the things that I wanted to bring up today is to warn people
[00:45:45.632 --> 00:45:48.233]  That it's not just CPS grabbing children.
[00:45:50.273 --> 00:45:53.994]  Human Resources will grab elderly people too.
[00:45:54.334 --> 00:45:57.115]  Oh yeah, they're grabbing them and then they take them and they euthanize them.
[00:45:57.135 --> 00:46:06.658]  Wall Street Journal's done a great, it's got to be a 20 plus part series now, Wesley Smith, and he just lists the hundreds of names, they kill them every day, begging for food and water, chained down.
[00:46:07.438 --> 00:46:11.459]  Once the state, oh yeah, Paul behind the glass in there was going, what?
[00:46:11.999 --> 00:46:14.300]  I promise you, I'm going to do some more shows on that.
[00:46:15.027 --> 00:46:17.467]  Yes, it's very true.
[00:46:18.748 --> 00:46:25.389]  My dad and I listen to you every day and we appreciate everything that you do.
[00:46:26.329 --> 00:46:43.432]  I had decided to run for an alderman seat here in our town and my main two issues have been to make vaccine exemptions available at registration for schools.
[00:46:44.679 --> 00:46:47.640]  Because they don't let you know there's no law and there's a waiver.
[00:46:47.821 --> 00:46:51.422]  They tell you it's the law and expel you criminally through fraud.
[00:46:52.483 --> 00:46:58.426]  Well, my parents, who are 80 years old, I did not give them a flu shot this year.
[00:46:58.826 --> 00:47:00.306]  I didn't take them to get their flu shot.
[00:47:01.627 --> 00:47:06.850]  Four weeks ago, my parents both came down with some bizarre strain of flu.
[00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:09.591]  They are both now in hospice.
[00:47:11.992 --> 00:47:13.833]  And I have
[00:47:14.437 --> 00:47:16.660]  Social Services all over me now.
[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:18.963]  I was saying you didn't give them flu shots or you're bad.
[00:47:19.804 --> 00:47:22.807]  I was negligent in caring for my parents.
[00:47:22.827 --> 00:47:28.134]  Well number one, again this is quasi-government, it's not even law, it's all color of law, it's all fraud.
[00:47:28.154 --> 00:47:30.657]  But this is what you print off, this is mainstream news.
[00:47:31.057 --> 00:47:32.519]  For the last six years straight,
[00:47:33.698 --> 00:47:38.281]  The flu shot they've come up with is they try to guess which one the main strain is going to be.
[00:47:38.741 --> 00:47:41.803]  For the last six years, they have not guessed the proper strain.
[00:47:42.163 --> 00:47:46.225]  So the flu shot vaccine has no, you know, it doesn't help anybody.
[00:47:46.325 --> 00:47:49.167]  And the more flu shots we get, the more flu we see.
[00:47:49.387 --> 00:47:53.790]  There's about eight different strains running around the country today, but there's one flu shot.
[00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:59.652]  There's all these big studies, and if you've had more than three flu shots, it more than doubles your chances of Alzheimer's.
[00:47:59.872 --> 00:48:10.135]  They're still filled with thimerosal, mercury, and so you're telling me, Barbara, that these creatures, well, they want to remove your control of your parents so they can euthanize them, right?
[00:48:10.835 --> 00:48:12.356]  That's exactly what they want to do.
[00:48:13.576 --> 00:48:17.578]  And then they probably want to assign you to somehow steal their money for themselves.
[00:48:17.618 --> 00:48:21.939]  It's big money to take their... You know what, tell folks what's happening with the crime syndicate.
[00:48:22.566 --> 00:48:27.495]  I mean, I had to fight them to let a feeding tube be put into my mother.
[00:48:28.596 --> 00:48:31.782]  But they're telling you that you're bad and want to hurt them.
[00:48:31.842 --> 00:48:32.102]  Right.
[00:48:33.593 --> 00:48:34.174]  But you know what?
[00:48:34.214 --> 00:48:35.375]  People don't know about this.
[00:48:35.415 --> 00:48:39.157]  They don't know that every day, in every town, they're murdering people en masse.
[00:48:39.557 --> 00:48:41.718]  Just like in Germany, it started with euthanizing the old.
[00:48:42.179 --> 00:48:52.105]  They don't know that these people think that they sign themselves over to the state when their kids don't care, and that they chain you down, begging for food and water, and that they then dehydrate you.
[00:48:52.305 --> 00:48:56.047]  I'm not talking about the case they gave national attention to Terry Schiavo, folks.
[00:48:56.507 --> 00:48:59.189]  I mean people like Eric Winland and others.
[00:48:59.509 --> 00:49:07.852]  Where he could even get up and walk around, but the state got control of him and wanted his money, so they chained him down in L.A.
[00:49:07.912 --> 00:49:08.392]  and murdered him.
[00:49:08.892 --> 00:49:11.373]  So, what are these chimeras doing?
[00:49:12.613 --> 00:49:14.694]  Well, um... How did it work?
[00:49:14.714 --> 00:49:24.778]  You took them to the hospital, and then you thought the hospital was friendly, so they were asking you questionnaires, putting it in the computer while you were inducting them.
[00:49:25.398 --> 00:49:26.758]  The nurse was there, your friend.
[00:49:26.998 --> 00:49:28.779]  Honey, have they had their shots?
[00:49:29.378 --> 00:49:41.886]  And there's no law they have to, and you go, no I didn't this year, and she went, mmm, and looked at you, and then a few hours later, they showed up and started trying to claim they were taking your parents from you, they sent them to a hospice, and they're killing them right now.
[00:49:41.906 --> 00:49:44.828]  Uh, yeah.
[00:49:44.848 --> 00:49:53.734]  So I don't know for the listeners, because people don't know, this is all federally standardized through the eugenics boards, known as bioethics boards, but tell folks that don't know what happened.
[00:49:55.146 --> 00:49:59.447]  Well, I have been just bombarded with social workers.
[00:50:00.007 --> 00:50:01.728]  I mean, tearing in and out of my house.
[00:50:01.808 --> 00:50:10.270]  I'm having to fight for my parents because they told me that I couldn't take care of them.
[00:50:10.770 --> 00:50:15.711]  Basically, if I didn't have enough sense to give them a flu shot, I certainly didn't have enough sense to take care of them.
[00:50:15.731 --> 00:50:18.111]  And again, there's no law you have to take any shots.
[00:50:18.412 --> 00:50:20.272]  There's no law you have to take these flu shots.
[00:50:20.814 --> 00:50:22.054]  Well, that's what I told them.
[00:50:22.254 --> 00:50:33.617]  There was no law and the doctor, and I even had an argument back in October, I wanted to see the package insert to see if the Marisol was in it.
[00:50:33.977 --> 00:50:39.998]  I told him the only way they'd get a flu shot was if he showed me the package insert and proved the Marisol was not in the shot.
[00:50:40.158 --> 00:50:41.258]  And he couldn't do it, could he?
[00:50:41.938 --> 00:50:46.359]  He brought the insert in and it was right there on the insert.
[00:50:46.719 --> 00:50:48.420]  But he told you didn't say it, didn't he?
[00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:49.840]  He told me it didn't say it.
[00:50:50.635 --> 00:50:51.475]  That's double thinking.
[00:50:51.575 --> 00:50:52.295]  Yeah, they're cults.
[00:50:52.375 --> 00:50:55.596]  He walked in and took it out, and he said, it doesn't say it.
[00:50:55.976 --> 00:50:57.077]  And I said, let me see it.
[00:50:57.197 --> 00:50:59.917]  And he handed it to me, and it was on there.
[00:51:00.457 --> 00:51:02.438]  And I said, it says the Marisol right there.
[00:51:02.458 --> 00:51:03.638]  Yeah, for listeners, you know what?
[00:51:03.658 --> 00:51:04.418]  Put her on hold.
[00:51:04.698 --> 00:51:08.319]  Ma'am, I want you to fax Trey in the morning documentation of what happened.
[00:51:08.339 --> 00:51:09.679]  I want to have you on as a guest, okay?
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:11.120]  Okay?
[00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:13.100]  Put her on hold.
[00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:14.721]  Get her number right now, guys.
[00:51:15.221 --> 00:51:16.361]  Get her full name and number.
[00:51:17.495 --> 00:51:19.896]  Because there's a lot of things I want to do series on again.
[00:51:19.916 --> 00:51:26.697]  I'm going to do a big series on how they're exterminating the old people in euthanasia pits all over the country.
[00:51:27.997 --> 00:51:31.298]  And I want to do a whole other series on how they're poisoning the water by design.
[00:51:31.318 --> 00:51:34.479]  And I'm going to do a whole other series on government shipping drugs in.
[00:51:35.079 --> 00:51:36.939]  And I'm just going to continue to fight the evil.
[00:51:36.959 --> 00:51:38.559]  We'll come back, take more calls.
[00:51:38.599 --> 00:51:40.120]  I mean, see, these are all great callers.
[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:42.060]  And there's no way to get to them all.
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:44.841]  Huge financial news coming up.
[00:51:45.181 --> 00:51:45.741]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:51.016 --> 00:51:52.056]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[00:52:24.606 --> 00:52:26.527]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:52:27.248 --> 00:52:30.410]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:52:31.051 --> 00:52:37.535]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.

[00:52:51.061 --> 00:52:52.081]  The Idealocom.
[00:52:52.981 --> 00:53:02.063]  Prepare yourself for a talk radio that will carry your excuse like no other has known before.
[00:53:03.063 --> 00:53:04.383]  He stands for truth.
[00:53:05.824 --> 00:53:07.664]  He stands for justice.
[00:53:09.024 --> 00:53:10.585]  He stands for what's right.
[00:53:11.265 --> 00:53:13.785]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:53:14.765 --> 00:53:17.606]  Call Alex now, toll free, at 877-
[00:53:19.467 --> 00:53:32.318]  Look, this isn't a radio show to me.
[00:53:32.338 --> 00:53:33.339]  This isn't an ego trip.
[00:53:33.399 --> 00:53:34.199]  It's not fun.
[00:53:34.439 --> 00:53:35.100]  It's upsetting.
[00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:36.021]  It's enraging.
[00:53:37.862 --> 00:53:38.983]  I know we got a lot of phone lines.
[00:53:39.043 --> 00:53:42.466]  I got 15 plus news stories up that are incredibly important I want to cover.
[00:53:42.906 --> 00:53:45.989]  All I want to do is warn you, the people perish for lack of knowledge.
[00:53:47.256 --> 00:53:54.101]  A scientific control grid is in place that even people carrying out the evil are compartmentalized and don't see what they're part of.
[00:53:54.402 --> 00:53:55.783]  Most of them think they're doing good.
[00:53:57.044 --> 00:53:58.325]  I've taken two phone calls.
[00:53:58.345 --> 00:54:01.487]  The phones have been loaded the entire show and I haven't even gotten everybody.
[00:54:01.527 --> 00:54:02.028]  I want to.
[00:54:02.048 --> 00:54:05.670]  I went to talk to this lady during the break and I asked her some questions.
[00:54:06.111 --> 00:54:10.354]  You notice I can answer and tell her what happened before she told me the story.
[00:54:10.914 --> 00:54:12.896]  Because I've been covering this for more than a decade.
[00:54:13.416 --> 00:54:14.317]  Since I learned about it.
[00:54:15.407 --> 00:54:19.868]  Okay, eugenics took over the western sciences 100 years ago.
[00:54:21.168 --> 00:54:26.149]  35 states sterilized hundreds of thousands of people, killed babies, killed old people.
[00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:35.051]  They took the ideas of Sparta, you know, you kill any infirm baby, you kill somebody when they're old, if they're weak, you don't nurture people back.
[00:54:35.952 --> 00:54:37.752]  The Nazis picked up on that.
[00:54:39.119 --> 00:54:43.343]  And they took those ideas and they put that into what we have today.
[00:54:43.363 --> 00:54:46.706]  You better find out what eugenics is right now!
[00:54:47.686 --> 00:54:47.947]  Now!
[00:54:48.107 --> 00:54:50.769]  Listen to me.
[00:54:50.849 --> 00:54:51.930]  I just talked to her during the break.
[00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:53.271]  I'm going to have her on during the week.
[00:54:53.912 --> 00:54:57.295]  There's thousands of these cases and people contacting me, but I've picked her case to cover.
[00:54:58.336 --> 00:55:00.898]  She's going to send me all the documentation, but I already know it from what she's told me.
[00:55:01.781 --> 00:55:07.687]  They're instructed to tell you there's no thimerosal, and then they're instructed, if you read it, to tell you that you're not reading it.
[00:55:07.928 --> 00:55:08.729]  That's how I told her.
[00:55:08.829 --> 00:55:10.811]  Oh, let me guess, they told you it isn't there.
[00:55:11.111 --> 00:55:12.633]  They talk to you like you're children.
[00:55:14.013 --> 00:55:19.117]  They'll sit there across the table from you at a public school and tell you there is no waiver to not take vaccines.
[00:55:19.677 --> 00:55:20.178]  It's the law.
[00:55:20.438 --> 00:55:22.800]  It doesn't matter if there's a law saying they've got to give you that waiver.
[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:24.181]  It's crime.
[00:55:24.221 --> 00:55:25.321]  It's evil government.
[00:55:25.702 --> 00:55:31.846]  With people who think you're a baby and you're the child and the state has to lie to you for your own good.
[00:55:31.886 --> 00:55:32.247]  Now listen.
[00:55:34.628 --> 00:55:36.149]  The government's engineering super flus.
[00:55:36.189 --> 00:55:37.631]  They've been putting them out in the population.
[00:55:37.651 --> 00:55:38.932]  That's even leaked out in the press.
[00:55:39.352 --> 00:55:40.633]  Her parents get super ill.
[00:55:41.454 --> 00:55:42.675]  She's been giving them the flu shot.
[00:55:42.715 --> 00:55:43.535]  She did in that year.
[00:55:43.855 --> 00:55:44.516]  There's no law.
[00:55:44.556 --> 00:55:45.156]  You have to take it.
[00:55:45.576 --> 00:55:47.978]  By the way, the last six years haven't even been the right screen.
[00:55:48.218 --> 00:55:48.678]  They pick.
[00:55:48.938 --> 00:55:51.580]  It doubles your chances of Alzheimer's after three consecutive shots.
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:53.781]  All mainstream, all mainline data.
[00:55:53.981 --> 00:55:55.002]  You'll never see it on the news.
[00:55:56.623 --> 00:56:00.705]  And I talked to her in the break, and she told me that they've given her father back.
[00:56:01.606 --> 00:56:03.687]  The mother, they refuse to give water or food.
[00:56:04.967 --> 00:56:05.808]  And they're killing her.
[00:56:06.808 --> 00:56:11.151]  But then they say to you with weird cult-like double think, you weren't good to your mommy.
[00:56:11.846 --> 00:56:14.447]  You didn't give her the flu shot when there's no law.
[00:56:16.408 --> 00:56:17.768]  And so now, what happened?
[00:56:17.788 --> 00:56:20.810]  I mean, I remember being 16 years old almost dying once when I had the flu.
[00:56:20.850 --> 00:56:21.510]  It's tough stuff.
[00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:28.093]  I mean, I couldn't eat for four or five days and all you got to do is take these people in and give them a shot of penegrin.
[00:56:28.393 --> 00:56:29.773]  Then they don't throw up anymore.
[00:56:29.813 --> 00:56:30.854]  Then they can hold down their food.
[00:56:31.054 --> 00:56:33.955]  They've had her mother eight days without food and water.
[00:56:33.995 --> 00:56:34.715]  They won't give it to her.
[00:56:34.735 --> 00:56:36.376]  She's having to go to court to try to get it to her.
[00:56:36.736 --> 00:56:38.297]  Most people at that age die within 10.
[00:56:39.381 --> 00:56:43.726]  I was going to have her on in the next few days, but I found this out during the break, and we can't wait.
[00:56:45.548 --> 00:56:47.990]  Again, there's no law, no judge, no jury.
[00:56:48.110 --> 00:56:50.653]  It's just these nothing workers from the government.
[00:56:50.853 --> 00:56:52.775]  See, as an American, you're supposed to get due process.
[00:56:53.076 --> 00:56:55.899]  As an American, they're not supposed to be spying on your bank accounts without a warrant.
[00:56:56.179 --> 00:56:58.662]  As an American, they're not supposed to be dialed into your phones without a warrant.
[00:56:58.882 --> 00:56:59.943]  But they do it all now.
[00:57:01.667 --> 00:57:03.629]  And it's eugenics, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:03.669 --> 00:57:19.241]  It's bioethics boards, because we've gone into foreign bank receivership, and under their rules, they want to kill old people off before they spend their whole savings on the medical care, so that half of it goes to the government through inheritance tax.
[00:57:19.801 --> 00:57:23.624]  These are all written up by the banks and insurance companies, and then governments just comply.
[00:57:24.125 --> 00:57:25.926]  Now, I know I said I got financial news, and I do.
[00:57:25.966 --> 00:57:29.149]  I know I said I got loaded phones, but I've got to finish up with Barbara.
[00:57:30.349 --> 00:57:32.770]  Barbara, now I need you to send me before we give names out.
[00:57:32.790 --> 00:57:34.751]  I'm going to give you a fax number tonight.
[00:57:34.771 --> 00:57:38.973]  I need you to go to Kinko's, wherever you have to, fax this to us this evening.
[00:57:39.413 --> 00:57:41.574]  Your parents' names, the facility they're in.
[00:57:42.234 --> 00:57:43.595]  I've got to make calls in the morning.
[00:57:43.975 --> 00:57:44.515]  I believe you.
[00:57:44.555 --> 00:57:45.536]  I can tell you're telling the truth.
[00:57:45.736 --> 00:57:46.516]  But I have to confirm it.
[00:57:46.536 --> 00:57:48.197]  Then we're going to give their phone numbers out.
[00:57:48.237 --> 00:57:49.197]  We're going to go after them.
[00:57:50.198 --> 00:57:52.419]  And believe me, they're going to let you have your mama real fast.
[00:57:52.859 --> 00:57:54.039]  Now, think about the psychology.
[00:57:54.319 --> 00:57:57.361]  You're a bad daughter because you didn't give them deadly mercury shots.
[00:57:58.530 --> 00:58:04.733]  They're now not going to let him have a feeding tube, and you're fighting, you've gotten your father back, you're fighting to get your mama back.
[00:58:05.034 --> 00:58:06.374]  Quickly finish up your story.
[00:58:06.955 --> 00:58:08.535]  In your own words, tell folks what's happening.
[00:58:08.555 --> 00:58:18.881]  Okay, well, the thing about, like I said about the feeding tube, they've been telling me that she's been too sick.
[00:58:19.574 --> 00:58:20.235]  To get a feeding tube.
[00:58:20.275 --> 00:58:24.258]  By the way, a hospital immediately, if you can't hold stuff down, gives you the feeding tube.
[00:58:24.499 --> 00:58:30.204]  The decision's been made to sanguinate, to dehydrate your mother.
[00:58:31.004 --> 00:58:34.488]  So see, the treatment, oh, she's too sick for fluids.
[00:58:34.668 --> 00:58:36.950]  WELL THEN PUT HER ON AN IV RIGHT NOW!
[00:58:39.051 --> 00:58:42.414]  Well... Do the scumbags have her on a... No, they don't.
[00:58:42.534 --> 00:58:44.496]  Because it's a death camp hospital.
[00:58:44.656 --> 00:58:45.136]  Tell me!
[00:58:45.276 --> 00:58:45.897]  Tell me!
[00:58:46.317 --> 00:58:48.019]  We got her on an IV.
[00:58:48.279 --> 00:58:50.260]  But you had to force them to do that, didn't you?
[00:58:50.841 --> 00:58:51.081]  Yes.
[00:58:51.521 --> 00:58:59.928]  It was with... See, and the day that I... See, they standardized all this Nazi stuff to where it's normal, and then the public goes along with it.
[00:58:59.968 --> 00:59:00.709]  Go ahead.
[00:59:00.789 --> 00:59:01.570]  Now, how did this start?
[00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:03.011]  Your parents were in the hospital.
[00:59:03.331 --> 00:59:05.773]  They... Just go ahead.
[00:59:06.033 --> 00:59:06.794]  Okay, when they...
[00:59:08.337 --> 00:59:17.821]  They had, she wasn't on an IV and the day that I got her back on the IV I went in there and I just, I went off.
[00:59:17.961 --> 00:59:20.982]  I went just totally off, screaming and yelling.
[00:59:21.882 --> 00:59:29.325]  Now let me guess, they were in a hospital but the City of Memphis Health Department ordered that they be sent to a death facility?
[00:59:30.385 --> 00:59:34.547]  Well, she's not in a nursing home, she's in a halfway
[00:59:35.157 --> 00:59:37.438]  Between... It's a... I know what it is.
[00:59:38.058 --> 00:59:38.698]  It's a hospice.
[00:59:39.359 --> 00:59:39.559]  Right.
[00:59:39.599 --> 00:59:41.680]  I'm telling you, you took him to a hospital, right?
[00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:43.300]  Or did the CPS come?
[00:59:44.041 --> 00:59:47.602]  Yeah, but anyway, I was trying to get the IV, and I was doing all this screaming.
[00:59:47.982 --> 00:59:52.304]  Well, before, when I started... See, normally they just taser you, but go ahead.
[00:59:52.344 --> 00:59:56.346]  Well, here come all the social workers in.
[00:59:57.066 --> 00:59:58.606]  We'll know you're under a lot of stress.
[00:59:58.646 --> 01:00:00.467]  Then they start trying to make me out to be a nutcase.
[01:00:00.507 --> 01:00:02.568]  Bioethicists, young.
[01:00:02.668 --> 01:00:04.669]  Okay, because you wanted your mama to have an IV.
[01:00:05.623 --> 01:00:05.883]  Right.
[01:00:06.724 --> 01:00:08.264]  So I've got her back on her IV.
[01:00:08.504 --> 01:00:14.227]  I mean, it has been just... I do think that I'm going to get the feeding tube tomorrow.
[01:00:14.247 --> 01:00:17.209]  You know, I don't think they're going to take her off of anything.
[01:00:17.229 --> 01:00:19.430]  But they're telling you you're bad because... Right.
[01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:22.331]  And I'm being... Let me stop you.
[01:00:22.351 --> 01:00:23.672]  Where did you first bring them?
[01:00:23.892 --> 01:00:24.512]  Let me stop you.
[01:00:24.752 --> 01:00:25.773]  Where did you first bring them?
[01:00:26.613 --> 01:00:28.374]  To Methodist North Hospital.
[01:00:28.494 --> 01:00:28.974]  Exactly.
[01:00:29.014 --> 01:00:34.797]  Now, there was a nurse there with a computer on the wall with a laptop on her lap asking you questions, correct?
[01:00:35.359 --> 01:00:35.699]  Correct.
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:42.683]  Now again, I'm going to put you back on hold, we're going to make sure you get our fax number, and I'm going to talk to you on the radio tomorrow, okay?
[01:00:43.343 --> 01:00:43.663]  Okay.
[01:00:43.823 --> 01:00:45.184]  Okay, now I need the documentation.
[01:00:46.885 --> 01:00:47.405]  Let me explain.
[01:00:47.525 --> 01:00:51.147]  I'm going to get to this later, but I'm going to do police state now, and I know the callers understand.
[01:00:51.427 --> 01:00:55.229]  Jeremy, Matt V, Daniel, Chris, Chris, Steve, Ted, and others.
[01:00:56.950 --> 01:01:03.733]  The whole economy is melting down right now, and I need to tell you who's behind it and who's doing it, but I've got to cover this first, okay?
[01:01:05.402 --> 01:01:10.824]  My wife, you know, middle class, college degree, great person.
[01:01:10.844 --> 01:01:11.805]  They do this to everybody.
[01:01:11.965 --> 01:01:12.805]  This is done to everyone.
[01:01:14.226 --> 01:01:17.247]  North Austin Medical Center, her sister's a pediatrician there.
[01:01:17.787 --> 01:01:22.389]  I'm friends with the doctor there who's delivered all three of our babies.
[01:01:24.090 --> 01:01:30.713]  And I go in there, and I still have it at the hospital, but the problem is it's such a dangerous environment now.
[01:01:31.505 --> 01:01:40.150]  As Mr. Quaid will be on 60 Minutes tonight documenting, when they give the kid at another hospital, this wasn't here, hundreds of times, you know, the safe level of the vitamin K shot they demand to give the baby.
[01:01:41.450 --> 01:01:46.373]  But my story, statistically, by the way, it's more dangerous to be in a hospital than on the highway.
[01:01:46.693 --> 01:01:50.495]  Hundreds of thousands of drug deaths a year from them prescribing the wrong thing, but side issue.
[01:01:50.535 --> 01:01:51.676]  Nice hospital, nice people.
[01:01:51.776 --> 01:01:52.136]  Even there.
[01:01:52.556 --> 01:01:54.437]  It's not law, it's regulations.
[01:01:54.457 --> 01:01:59.320]  They just tell the... the Health Department tells the hospital this.
[01:02:00.859 --> 01:02:01.980]  We get in there at 5.30 in the morning.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.662]  We're going to have a cesarean section because we've already had two before.
[01:02:04.682 --> 01:02:07.324]  I already visited the drill.
[01:02:07.364 --> 01:02:12.248]  The nurse is asking her all sorts of personal and private questions, putting them in a computer that goes to the health department.
[01:02:14.089 --> 01:02:15.330]  And then I go, here it comes.
[01:02:15.370 --> 01:02:17.652]  She tells me, will you go down here and take this vial over here?
[01:02:17.692 --> 01:02:19.093]  Will you take that downstairs for me?
[01:02:19.753 --> 01:02:21.335]  And I winked at my wife and walked out.
[01:02:21.355 --> 01:02:23.316]  As soon as I leave, she goes, honey, does he beat you?
[01:02:24.197 --> 01:02:29.621]  Honey, honey, do you have a good home environment?
[01:02:30.595 --> 01:02:38.300]  Now, no judge, no jury, no reading her rights, no telling her this was going to not the police, who've got to follow due process, but to the special goon squad.
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:39.781]  And my wife said, no.
[01:02:40.221 --> 01:02:43.583]  But the average woman doesn't know that, and might say, yeah, we've had a few fights.
[01:02:43.824 --> 01:02:45.225]  Your kids are gone, your life's over.
[01:02:45.925 --> 01:02:48.507]  It's a Stasi society built into everything.
[01:02:48.847 --> 01:02:50.908]  We'll be right back.
[01:02:52.889 --> 01:02:54.290]  It is a big idea.
[01:02:55.371 --> 01:02:56.432]  A new world order.
[01:02:57.132 --> 01:02:58.073]  In the near future.
[01:02:58.926 --> 01:03:01.328]  Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:03:02.008 --> 01:03:04.169]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:03:04.830 --> 01:03:06.951]  Wouldn't their objective be world domination?
[01:03:07.631 --> 01:03:10.053]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:03:10.813 --> 01:03:18.118]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:03:21.138 --> 01:03:26.121]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:03:26.601 --> 01:03:30.063]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:03:30.463 --> 01:03:32.984]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[01:03:33.024 --> 01:03:34.185]  Most people have no idea.
[01:03:34.205 --> 01:03:34.965]  They're not after money.
[01:03:34.985 --> 01:03:36.046]  They have all the money they need.
[01:03:36.266 --> 01:03:36.986]  They're after power.
[01:03:37.227 --> 01:03:38.267]  That's what they're after.
[01:03:38.387 --> 01:03:42.929]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[01:03:46.251 --> 01:03:47.512]  Endgame.
[01:03:47.852 --> 01:03:49.473]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:03:49.893 --> 01:03:51.053]  You have been warned.
[01:03:52.394 --> 01:03:53.674]  Hi neighbor.
[01:03:54.895 --> 01:03:56.615]  We all know that knowledge is power.
[01:03:57.035 --> 01:04:00.136]  We've tried to give you knowledge to help you prepare for rough times.
[01:04:00.736 --> 01:04:05.438]  There's the worldwide famine and our country's dependence on often dangerous food imports.
[01:04:06.058 --> 01:04:08.059]  You know about genetically poisoned food.
[01:04:08.579 --> 01:04:14.181]  Two-thirds of the food is disappearing with the bees along with huge crop failures from all-time record water shortages.
[01:04:14.881 --> 01:04:18.542]  You know they're turning food into fuel with corn ethanol plants.
[01:04:19.506 --> 01:04:23.208]  If we do not control our food, food will be used to control us.
[01:04:23.728 --> 01:04:28.890]  Food control has been the plan historically in every enslaved population and is the plan for America.
[01:04:29.550 --> 01:04:37.814]  The only value of the knowledge you have to take control of your food is if you choose to give a supply while you still have the freedom to choose.
[01:04:38.274 --> 01:04:39.415]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[01:04:39.435 --> 01:04:39.575]  Call 800-409-5633.
[01:04:53.067 --> 01:04:56.728]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:04:57.129 --> 01:05:02.551]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:05:03.031 --> 01:05:04.091]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[01:05:04.131 --> 01:05:08.173]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:05:08.833 --> 01:05:22.166]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:05:22.646 --> 01:05:27.971]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report, Exploiting the Boundaries of Trading Precious Metals Privately.
[01:05:28.251 --> 01:05:34.137]  Whether you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[01:05:38.302 --> 01:05:40.224]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[01:05:40.244 --> 01:05:40.304]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:05:52.359 --> 01:06:05.085]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:06:05.506 --> 01:06:12.229]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[01:06:12.609 --> 01:06:16.191]  And the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:06:16.571 --> 01:06:19.733]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[01:06:19.973 --> 01:06:21.674]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[01:06:21.734 --> 01:06:27.458]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[01:06:43.487 --> 01:06:45.747]  We're in a no-holds-barred information war.
[01:06:46.127 --> 01:06:51.469]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[01:06:55.110 --> 01:06:59.872]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:07:07.492 --> 01:07:11.213]  Folks, this stuff is so amazing that I can't even believe what's going on.
[01:07:11.293 --> 01:07:15.274]  And the people killing our old people, spying on us, doing all of this, think they're good.
[01:07:18.234 --> 01:07:21.635]  It's all been inculcated into the bureaucracy.
[01:07:23.035 --> 01:07:27.456]  You know, when you go to a hospital, there's supposed to be medical privacy.
[01:07:27.476 --> 01:07:29.937]  You're supposed to trust your nurse, trust your doctor.
[01:07:30.437 --> 01:07:35.198]  You're sitting in there at 5.30 in the morning in the hospital, the head nurse comes in,
[01:07:36.643 --> 01:07:42.386]  99% of people, even me, who lives all this and has the documents, doesn't realize.
[01:07:42.406 --> 01:07:43.327]  It was a nice lady, too.
[01:07:43.367 --> 01:07:44.147]  She didn't mean evil.
[01:07:44.667 --> 01:07:46.528]  That's what's so wicked about the New World Order.
[01:07:47.449 --> 01:07:49.049]  And then they divert you out of the room.
[01:07:49.069 --> 01:07:51.371]  She goes, will you take this down here for me, hun?
[01:07:51.451 --> 01:07:51.811]  Thank you.
[01:07:51.831 --> 01:07:56.033]  And I saw the predatory look of officialness and manipulation.
[01:07:56.073 --> 01:07:56.713]  I said, sure.
[01:07:56.733 --> 01:07:58.514]  I winked at my wife, walked out.
[01:07:58.574 --> 01:07:59.335]  We've been through the drill.
[01:07:59.355 --> 01:08:01.796]  I already knew about it before I ever had children.
[01:08:03.116 --> 01:08:03.957]  Six, seven years ago.
[01:08:05.138 --> 01:08:06.018]  So I had people on about it.
[01:08:07.068 --> 01:08:10.409]  And as soon as I walk out, she goes, we don't like the men in here for this, hon.
[01:08:11.209 --> 01:08:14.310]  And she, and I mean, this is like the inquisitor, hundreds of questions she'd already asked.
[01:08:16.611 --> 01:08:18.712]  And she says, does he hurt you?
[01:08:18.732 --> 01:08:19.352]  Does he hit you?
[01:08:19.432 --> 01:08:20.412]  Do you live in a good home?
[01:08:20.432 --> 01:08:22.493]  My wife said, absolutely, no.
[01:08:23.333 --> 01:08:29.475]  But the point is, a lot of people have had a knockdown drag out once or twice, or had a few problems.
[01:08:29.535 --> 01:08:30.376]  Most families have.
[01:08:30.396 --> 01:08:31.356]  Not in my family.
[01:08:33.553 --> 01:08:35.594]  But then she asked, well, is there any shouting going on?
[01:08:35.794 --> 01:08:37.275]  See, that's enough to get your kids taken down.
[01:08:37.355 --> 01:08:38.635]  No judge, no jury, no law.
[01:08:39.296 --> 01:08:40.536]  And my wife said, no, no, no.
[01:08:41.056 --> 01:08:42.157]  And it was every question.
[01:08:42.177 --> 01:08:43.117]  Have you ever used drugs?
[01:08:43.137 --> 01:08:44.178]  Have you ever done this and that?
[01:08:44.498 --> 01:08:45.698]  Any of that gets your kids taken.
[01:08:45.838 --> 01:08:49.220]  Do they tell you at every hospital when you go in and they ask, hon,
[01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:51.027]  Has he ever hit you?
[01:08:51.047 --> 01:08:51.987]  Do you live in a good environment?
[01:08:52.007 --> 01:08:52.588]  Does he yell at you?
[01:08:52.608 --> 01:08:55.510]  Do they tell you, by the way, we're going to take your kids if you say yes.
[01:08:55.930 --> 01:08:58.212]  There's no judge, there's no jury, they're coming.
[01:08:58.572 --> 01:09:03.876]  That baby's coming out of you, we're going to sit there like sly cats and not tell you, and we're going to take your baby, lady.
[01:09:04.816 --> 01:09:07.078]  No, because they're doing it for the good.
[01:09:08.112 --> 01:09:09.353]  And it's the same thing with this.
[01:09:09.713 --> 01:09:17.436]  In 1996, federal documents, $9 billion to telecommunications, that all cell phones be used as bugging devices even when they're off.
[01:09:18.097 --> 01:09:20.538]  This puts a lot of money into how much your cell phone costs.
[01:09:21.018 --> 01:09:28.001]  In fact, about half the cost you pay is just for GPS triangulation and so they can turn them on for audio and listen to you.
[01:09:28.021 --> 01:09:31.143]  And they said for spying, not for keeping you safe in emergencies.
[01:09:31.603 --> 01:09:32.704]  So I told everybody that in 96.
[01:09:33.144 --> 01:09:34.365]  I was already on the radio there.
[01:09:34.645 --> 01:09:35.946]  I was called a kookin' insane.
[01:09:36.406 --> 01:09:40.248]  Here is Fox News telling you how great it is today, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:09:41.309 --> 01:09:46.832]  Here they are, in your face, telling you what I've been telling you for more than 10 years.
[01:09:47.713 --> 01:09:50.735]  ...down your cell phone, there's no way the government could ever hear you.
[01:09:51.375 --> 01:09:52.596]  Certainly not the FBI.
[01:09:52.636 --> 01:09:53.637]  It's turned off, right?
[01:09:54.577 --> 01:09:55.818]  Have we got news for you.
[01:09:57.694 --> 01:10:00.357]  Alright, here's that cell phone story you've been waiting for.
[01:10:00.457 --> 01:10:03.300]  Cell phone users beware, Big Brother may be listening.
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:10.307]  The Federal Bureau of Investigation can now hear everything you say, even when the cell phone is turned off.
[01:10:10.507 --> 01:10:21.638]  I know, it sounds kind of out there, but using your phone's tracking device, authorities can now activate the microphone inside the dreaded thing, allowing them to eavesdrop on you and your conversations.
[01:10:22.259 --> 01:10:23.460]  Alright, so see, it's to stop the Mafia.
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:24.060]  No, it's not.
[01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:27.123]  The NSA randomly listens to everybody's phones with supercomputers.
[01:10:27.603 --> 01:10:29.184]  It randomly dials in and listens.
[01:10:29.204 --> 01:10:33.988]  Google admits they use the microphone in your computer to listen to you.
[01:10:34.028 --> 01:10:35.849]  Oh, you didn't know that was true?
[01:10:35.889 --> 01:10:36.189]  Absolutely.
[01:10:54.735 --> 01:10:55.195]  You know what?
[01:10:55.236 --> 01:11:00.638]  I've got all this police state news and I'm told Daniel Sanjada, he's got that big hit show about the fireman, is on the line.
[01:11:00.678 --> 01:11:01.759]  I've talked to him, interviewed him before.
[01:11:02.639 --> 01:11:03.339]  And I've got this.
[01:11:03.519 --> 01:11:05.961]  Right now, Feds might be looking into your finances.
[01:11:06.061 --> 01:11:10.843]  Each year, federal agents pick up the financial transactions of 17-plus million Americans without their knowledge.
[01:11:11.283 --> 01:11:19.507]  The same type of information that raises suspicion about New York Governor Eliot Spitzer is reviewed every day by authorities to find traces of money laundering, check fraud, and identity theft.
[01:11:19.807 --> 01:11:20.688]  Okay, let me just stop there.
[01:11:20.708 --> 01:11:21.408]  Again, no judge, no jury.
[01:11:21.428 --> 01:11:22.990]  Guilty until proven innocent.
[01:11:23.010 --> 01:11:24.271]  I'm about to go to Daniel Senjata.
[01:11:24.371 --> 01:11:25.532]  I just want to make this point.
[01:11:25.552 --> 01:11:26.172]  You're guilty first!
[01:11:26.192 --> 01:11:26.873]  You're guilty first!
[01:11:26.893 --> 01:11:27.813]  You're guilty first!
[01:11:46.761 --> 01:11:56.851]  And by the way, I've been told by folks high level in IRS, even most of their employees aren't allowed to know this, that everyone's bank account is automatically uploaded to the government now, and it's just, they don't even have to do know your customer now.
[01:11:57.251 --> 01:12:04.298]  They just will call the bank and say, we'd like you to start an investigation, and then we're gonna, you know, so then they can say the bank told them.
[01:12:05.058 --> 01:12:11.865]  It's just all run, all the major banks, just like in 2004, they said, we have a new customer privacy act,
[01:12:14.070 --> 01:12:16.833]  And you're going to get more privacy from the pharmacist.
[01:12:17.253 --> 01:12:26.101]  Under law, everything, whether it's for prosthesis, diaphragm, ibuprofen, prescription drink, Motrin, everything you do, instantly uploaded to the feds.
[01:12:27.242 --> 01:12:28.303]  It's all uploaded.
[01:12:28.823 --> 01:12:32.266]  And that federalized all your doctors and dentists and clinics and took control of them.
[01:12:33.618 --> 01:12:36.120]  Look, everything you do is on a government computer screen.
[01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:40.423]  Where you are, all of the cell phones track you down to real time.
[01:12:40.603 --> 01:12:49.931]  They're just now telling local police at the FEMA emergency centers they put in, I told you eight years ago when we learned about it, they type in your name or the phone number and it pops up where you're at, where your cell phone's at.
[01:12:51.111 --> 01:12:55.215]  City of Austin, now at their emergency center, I'm told they're just about to tell Austin they've got this.
[01:12:55.255 --> 01:12:56.896]  First place they told us was Green Bay three years ago.
[01:12:57.805 --> 01:13:00.630]  Type Alex Jones in, baby, boom, right where I'm at.
[01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:03.154]  No judge, no jury, no warrant, no nothing.
[01:13:03.475 --> 01:13:07.101]  Just like they don't tell you when you go in to have a baby, they're watching everything you do.
[01:13:08.283 --> 01:13:09.826]  What line is Daniel Senjata on?
[01:13:11.283 --> 01:13:12.263]  Hey man, how you doing?
[01:13:12.623 --> 01:13:13.424]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:13:13.784 --> 01:13:14.064]  Good.
[01:13:14.184 --> 01:13:15.984]  I need to get you back on as a proper guest.
[01:13:16.144 --> 01:13:20.606]  Tell folks, I know you're just calling about some other issue, but tell folks about your TV show so they know who you are.
[01:13:20.986 --> 01:13:21.466]  You know what?
[01:13:22.006 --> 01:13:25.627]  The show's about post-9-11 New York City firefighters.
[01:13:26.127 --> 01:13:31.309]  It's the reason why I initially came out publicly about the fact that I know that 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:13:31.349 --> 01:13:32.649]  Not that we think, but that we know.
[01:13:33.357 --> 01:13:38.420]  And the reason why I'm calling today, Alex, just kind of in an impromptu way is that I am just freaking out.
[01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:40.541]  I'm freaking out about all the stuff you're saying.
[01:13:41.021 --> 01:13:49.806]  I'm thinking about everything in context, everything from the fact, you know, what the Naomi Wolf coming on and talking about the ten points of how, you know, society slipped.
[01:13:50.146 --> 01:14:13.736]  Towards fascism from free societies towards fascism from the eugenics to Fixed elections the fact that you know people in the entertainment industry like Marion Cotillard are bravely coming out and speaking out about 9-11 and they will quickly vilify people like her or ignore people like me But they'll definitely ignore people like Bill Christensen, Lynn Margolis, Dwayne Deets You know, Ray McGovern, they'll ignore all the credible
[01:14:14.196 --> 01:14:14.736]  I don't know.
[01:14:34.327 --> 01:14:41.251]  Peacefully protesting as he was doing his broadcast, and we peacefully stood across the street and waited for him to get released from jail.
[01:14:41.551 --> 01:14:43.092]  We have never done anything violent.
[01:14:43.853 --> 01:14:49.436]  I'm sure the government's probably behind the bombing that went on in Times Square, and I'm just here to tell your listeners, I don't care anymore.
[01:14:49.796 --> 01:14:50.556]  I don't care anymore.
[01:14:50.576 --> 01:14:59.160]  I've been a little bit careful, a little bit worried about what the repercussions may possibly be for my career if I open my mouth too big, but at this point, I just don't care anymore.
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:06.523]  You're the main star of Rescue Me and a lot of other TV shows and movies.
[01:15:06.983 --> 01:15:07.203]  Absolutely.
[01:15:25.937 --> 01:15:27.358]  And I'm sorry to all the other callers.
[01:15:27.378 --> 01:15:29.059]  There's an economic meltdown happening.
[01:15:29.119 --> 01:15:29.779]  I've got that.
[01:15:30.259 --> 01:15:32.180]  I've got a huge stack of police state news.
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:33.601]  There's no Bill of Rights.
[01:15:33.641 --> 01:15:34.741]  There's no due process.
[01:15:34.761 --> 01:15:35.622]  There's no nothing.
[01:15:35.822 --> 01:15:37.223]  They're tracking everything.
[01:15:37.583 --> 01:15:39.244]  They're trying to catch you in their nets.
[01:15:39.924 --> 01:15:41.144]  The government is evil.
[01:15:41.185 --> 01:15:41.865]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:42.065 --> 01:15:44.846]  Look at the hate we're feeding.
[01:15:45.266 --> 01:15:47.287]  Look at the fear we're feeding.
[01:15:47.408 --> 01:15:49.649]  Look at the lies we're spreading.
[01:15:52.506 --> 01:15:53.147]  It's a fact.
[01:15:53.367 --> 01:16:00.832]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[01:16:00.972 --> 01:16:09.838]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[01:16:10.098 --> 01:16:20.645]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:16:20.905 --> 01:16:26.967]  We can terminate your unsecure debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[01:16:27.188 --> 01:16:32.209]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:36.871]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[01:16:37.031 --> 01:16:38.832]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[01:16:38.852 --> 01:16:39.072]  That's 877-943-8600.
[01:16:39.112 --> 01:16:39.572]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[01:16:39.692 --> 01:16:41.553]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[01:16:48.936 --> 01:16:50.357]  We're good to go.
[01:17:15.677 --> 01:17:18.978]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[01:17:51.377 --> 01:17:52.117]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:17:53.911 --> 01:17:54.371]  Alright, Dad.
[01:17:54.632 --> 01:17:55.632]  Let me get this straight.
[01:17:55.872 --> 01:17:57.974]  I'm sure whoever it is takes place in the future, right?
[01:17:58.094 --> 01:17:58.955]  Like Star Wars?
[01:17:59.115 --> 01:17:59.755]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:17:59.955 --> 01:18:00.916]  Slightly in the future.
[01:18:01.156 --> 01:18:01.917]  Wait a second.
[01:18:02.217 --> 01:18:05.339]  I thought Star Wars took place a long, long time ago.
[01:18:05.459 --> 01:18:06.400]  Alright, Einstein.
[01:18:06.540 --> 01:18:08.561]  But it is kinda like Star Wars anyway.
[01:18:08.722 --> 01:18:15.366]  Just like Star Wars, there's an evil empire and some people have started an armed rebellion to fight the evil empire.
[01:18:15.626 --> 01:18:15.947]  Okay.
[01:18:16.127 --> 01:18:16.907]  So don't tell me.
[01:18:17.228 --> 01:18:18.809]  The government's the bad guy again?
[01:18:18.889 --> 01:18:19.769]  Yep, that's right.
[01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:22.391]  Oh, so your character's like Luke Skywalker?
[01:18:22.771 --> 01:18:23.492]  Not exactly.
[01:18:23.792 --> 01:18:25.794]  I know, you're Chewbacca!
[01:18:25.914 --> 01:18:34.782]  Not really, but my character does help the rebellion to stop the government's evil tracking system, which is happening now in the real world, just like in Uncivil Liberties.
[01:18:34.983 --> 01:18:37.605]  Wait a second, they can't track us, it's a free country!
[01:18:38.125 --> 01:18:38.686]  Exactly.
[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:43.345]  Uncivil Liberties, a political thriller ripped from today's headlines.

[01:19:10.808 --> 01:19:11.649]  Here's the story.
[01:19:11.969 --> 01:19:19.812]  New video feed technology lets anyone with a high-speed internet connection gain instant access to an endless list of underground channels from all over the globe.
[01:19:20.112 --> 01:19:21.193]  And here's the best part.
[01:19:21.273 --> 01:19:24.374]  It's 100% legal, and it works at home, the office,
[01:19:24.694 --> 01:19:25.094]  I think so.
[01:19:54.255 --> 01:19:57.637]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:20:00.258 --> 01:20:14.906]  Yeah, we just booked Daniel Sanjada.
[01:20:15.046 --> 01:20:19.128]  He first went public on my radio show, about 9-11.
[01:20:19.248 --> 01:20:20.829]  Big an inside job.
[01:20:21.847 --> 01:20:26.032]  But to be accurate, he went to some public events wearing 9-11 Inside Job t-shirts.
[01:20:26.132 --> 01:20:30.197]  And then he came on my show, but he was wearing the 9-11 Inside Job t-shirt we put up.
[01:20:30.458 --> 01:20:32.280]  And he's just a great guy.
[01:20:32.881 --> 01:20:34.663]  And we appreciate him.
[01:20:35.521 --> 01:20:36.061]  Appreciate it.
[01:20:36.621 --> 01:20:39.422]  Now look, I know we got Steve, Chris, Ted, Jeremy.
[01:20:39.442 --> 01:20:40.843]  I'm sorry we didn't get to a lot of your calls.
[01:20:40.903 --> 01:20:41.703]  I did last week.
[01:20:41.983 --> 01:20:42.864]  I got this financial news.
[01:20:42.884 --> 01:20:47.085]  We're going to finish up with Daniel, ram through a bunch of your calls, and then get into the financial meltdown.
[01:20:47.525 --> 01:20:49.646]  And this is the important news of the day.
[01:20:49.666 --> 01:20:56.649]  I just, when they're euthanizing old people and stuff, I get off onto that and just get so mad, I can hardly even talk, because I know they're doing it.
[01:20:56.989 --> 01:20:58.269]  And I know you don't know about it.
[01:20:58.509 --> 01:21:01.590]  And you're so decent out there, you can't believe they're doing it.
[01:21:01.951 --> 01:21:03.051]  Well, believe me, they are!
[01:21:03.897 --> 01:21:06.779]  The Nazis learned everything they did from us!
[01:21:06.799 --> 01:21:14.162]  I used to think the Germans were liars when they said they didn't believe that Hitler was doing all that and they hadn't seen it.
[01:21:14.643 --> 01:21:16.804]  But now I've really studied the history and most of them didn't know.
[01:21:17.164 --> 01:21:18.424]  It was compartmentalized.
[01:21:18.825 --> 01:21:21.066]  And it started euthanizing old people and retarded children.
[01:21:21.686 --> 01:21:23.407]  And they're doing it all here in the U.S.
[01:21:23.487 --> 01:21:24.808]  and I'm sick of it.
[01:21:26.369 --> 01:21:26.729]  Daniel,
[01:21:28.135 --> 01:21:41.292]  Going back to Geraldo Rivera, I'm glad that you realize how serious this is, that for six months they had talking points on every major cable channel that 9-11 Truth are going to engage in terrorism, and now there's a bombing and they say we're behind it with no evidence.
[01:21:41.473 --> 01:21:42.454]  That's chilling!
[01:21:43.024 --> 01:21:47.168]  Yes, and it's a major, major signpost on the road to fascism.
[01:21:47.208 --> 01:21:48.369]  It's a major signpost.
[01:21:48.409 --> 01:21:50.111]  I mean, you ask Naomi Wolf, she'll tell you.
[01:21:50.651 --> 01:22:00.781]  Once they start doing stuff like that, once they start blaming violent acts on peaceful groups, I mean, and then calling for us to be thrown into camps and tased and...
[01:22:01.101 --> 01:22:02.142]  You know, beaten to a pulp.
[01:22:02.182 --> 01:22:04.083]  I mean, the next step is for them to start doing it.
[01:22:04.344 --> 01:22:07.946]  And once they start doing it to us, they'll start doing it to the average citizen, the normal person.
[01:22:07.966 --> 01:22:09.948]  You know, the good, decent people that are out there.
[01:22:09.968 --> 01:22:10.788]  People need to wake up.
[01:22:10.888 --> 01:22:12.930]  And that's key.
[01:22:13.010 --> 01:22:13.530]  Get active.
[01:22:13.570 --> 01:22:18.274]  That's what the average person doesn't know, Daniel, is that they pick out minorities first.
[01:22:18.334 --> 01:22:19.495]  The Arabs, Jews.
[01:22:20.235 --> 01:22:30.741]  You know, other organizations, other small sects, you know, the Sikhs, they always pick a little group to just set the precedent, but it's really aimed at the majority.
[01:22:31.001 --> 01:22:38.205]  So all these good old boys and all these white-collar yuppies who think that they're part of the structure, they don't know they're the real target.
[01:22:38.245 --> 01:22:39.265]  Go ahead.
[01:22:39.305 --> 01:22:44.368]  Yeah, just ask the Japanese citizens from 1942 about their precious inalienable rights.
[01:22:47.069 --> 01:22:49.451]  And how quickly they can be taken away and be thrown into camps.
[01:22:49.491 --> 01:22:57.838]  I mean, look, you know, your callers need to get on Google and they need to Google Daniel Hamburg rule by fear or rule by law and read that article.
[01:22:57.898 --> 01:23:03.002]  He documents very carefully that they do, that Alex has been telling the absolute truth to you.
[01:23:03.482 --> 01:23:08.063]  About the fact that there are prison camps set up that are empty that can house millions of people.
[01:23:08.443 --> 01:23:22.225]  And the next time they pull some type of a 9-11 style event, the very next thing it's going to be, I don't know whether it's a bird flu, whether it's a bombing, whatever it is, whatever gives the President an excuse to declare a national state of emergency, the very next thing is going to be roundups.
[01:23:22.545 --> 01:23:28.427]  And we're going to find ourselves in the exact same place that the German citizens found themselves during Hitler's ascent to power.
[01:23:28.527 --> 01:23:30.887]  Why did they create... Sorry, go ahead.
[01:23:31.391 --> 01:23:32.131]  No, you go ahead.
[01:23:32.151 --> 01:23:32.532]  You go ahead.
[01:23:32.572 --> 01:23:37.494]  I mean, why did they hire Tommy Franks and pay him secretly to go around and say martial law is coming?
[01:23:37.754 --> 01:23:39.335]  You know, too bad, but it's what we need.
[01:23:39.355 --> 01:23:45.978]  And again, that's a former congressman wrote a detailed article for the San Francisco Chronicle about the camps.
[01:23:46.548 --> 01:23:48.110]  And folks, it's bigger than Bush.
[01:23:49.411 --> 01:23:51.132]  Definitely, Hillary is their heir apparent.
[01:23:51.352 --> 01:23:55.156]  They're pulling out all the stops to put her in, and they're just going to continue this.
[01:23:55.256 --> 01:23:55.596]  Daniel?
[01:23:56.477 --> 01:24:00.701]  Yeah, well, I'm going to let you get onto the important news that you have to cover, Alex.
[01:24:00.741 --> 01:24:04.504]  The last thing I wanted to say, and the reason why I called in, is I want to put out a call right now.
[01:24:04.884 --> 01:24:06.506]  I want to put out a challenge and a call.
[01:24:06.926 --> 01:24:20.677]  To all of the high-profile celebrities, the people that are much bigger fish in the sea than myself, because nobody really listens to when I speak out, but those of you who are afraid to speak out, who may have a lot to lose, look, if you speak, please come forward.
[01:24:21.017 --> 01:24:21.858]  Say what you know.
[01:24:21.918 --> 01:24:34.228]  Those of you who have been listening to Alex, who are influential, who the media will not be able to ignore, just like they couldn't ignore Marion, you please come forward and speak out, and don't try to present yourself as the expert.
[01:24:34.668 --> 01:24:45.433]  Just refer the public who will listen to you to the real experts, like Alice, like Bill Christensen, like Lynn Margolis, like Congressman Kurt Weldon, like Ray McGovern, like Cynthia McKinney, like James Quintieri.
[01:24:45.713 --> 01:24:55.378]  There are lots of credible, coolly rational people who are speaking out, who are being completely ignored, and if you say something, the public will listen and the media will not be able to ignore it.
[01:24:55.438 --> 01:24:56.499]  That's all I have to say, Alex.
[01:24:56.559 --> 01:24:57.859]  I will talk to you tomorrow, my friend.
[01:24:57.899 --> 01:25:00.901]  Daniel, God bless you, and I really want to thank you for calling in.
[01:25:00.921 --> 01:25:01.361]  Take care.
[01:25:01.861 --> 01:25:02.261]  Absolutely.
[01:25:02.301 --> 01:25:02.542]  Bye-bye.
[01:25:02.882 --> 01:25:04.323]  And again, I want to go to all your calls.
[01:25:04.463 --> 01:25:09.606]  I'm chomping at the bit to make points, talking over Daniel, because it's all coming down to this.
[01:25:11.327 --> 01:25:13.248]  In the next segment, I'm going to explain it, okay?
[01:25:14.729 --> 01:25:17.750]  They are taking our entire financial system down.
[01:25:17.830 --> 01:25:21.332]  They need the false threat of terrorism as their excuse for all of this.
[01:25:22.153 --> 01:25:24.214]  And they need us to acquiesce and go along with it.
[01:25:24.694 --> 01:25:27.236]  If we go along with this, it's over, folks.
[01:25:27.976 --> 01:25:30.978]  I'm talking to those that are mainline liberals, mainline conservatives.
[01:25:31.875 --> 01:25:36.137]  If you keep thinking you're part of the power structure and you buy into this and you drink the Kool-Aid, it's over.
[01:25:36.377 --> 01:25:38.478]  Okay, let's jam in some calls as quickly as possible.
[01:25:38.858 --> 01:25:41.419]  Steve in Chicago, you're on the air.
[01:25:41.479 --> 01:25:41.799]  Welcome.
[01:25:46.590 --> 01:25:48.191]  Bear Stearns, bailout.
[01:25:48.832 --> 01:25:54.516]  According to the Financial Times, I got it up on the computer, and also the Wall Street Journal, everything's going swimmingly well.
[01:25:54.936 --> 01:26:01.120]  On the other hand, I'm checking at the same time Handelsblatt, the German trade paper, and Manager Magazine.
[01:26:02.101 --> 01:26:15.030]  They say that it's completely off, that the Chinese broker house CITIC, C-I-T-I-C, Securities, has reneged and walked away from the deal to pay... Well, former President Bush is one of the Chinese last week, flew there and asked them for true trail, and they said no.
[01:26:15.606 --> 01:26:15.826]  Yeah.
[01:26:16.187 --> 01:26:24.993]  So anyways, my accusation is Anglo-American business newspapers are falsifying, they're misleading, and duping the American public.
[01:26:25.274 --> 01:26:29.797]  They have to get with it and get smart and start realizing that they're getting conned.
[01:26:30.838 --> 01:26:31.198]  I agree.
[01:26:31.218 --> 01:26:31.899]  Anything else?
[01:26:32.599 --> 01:26:37.043]  Well, if there was one thing about Hillary Clinton, I think that people have been a little bit tough on her.
[01:26:37.843 --> 01:26:44.368]  I was going to mail you a picture of Michelle Obama and she had a black power Angela Davis fist.
[01:26:46.219 --> 01:26:50.720]  Everybody attacks Hillary, you know, the Hillary salute, but nobody speaks about that.
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:54.561]  I appreciate your call, but I mean, I make the fist.
[01:26:54.601 --> 01:26:57.321]  You know, the Communists expropriated that symbol.
[01:26:57.761 --> 01:26:59.621]  People have always gone, argh, I made a fist.
[01:26:59.661 --> 01:27:01.702]  I mean, I'm the opposite of a Communist and I make one.
[01:27:02.022 --> 01:27:03.822]  And look, I'm not here defending Barack Obama.
[01:27:03.862 --> 01:27:05.022]  He's obviously establishment.
[01:27:05.062 --> 01:27:05.763]  I mean, give me a break.
[01:27:07.103 --> 01:27:11.283]  But, you know, what is Preacher saying is now some big issue?
[01:27:11.704 --> 01:27:14.064]  Look, that is a political football they're playing.
[01:27:14.748 --> 01:27:17.051]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:27:17.591 --> 01:27:20.174]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Minnesota.
[01:27:20.614 --> 01:27:21.455]  Chris, you're on the air.
[01:27:21.495 --> 01:27:22.056]  Thanks for holding.
[01:27:22.699 --> 01:27:24.060]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:24.200]  Good.
[01:27:24.380 --> 01:27:28.083]  I'm a longtime listener and PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[01:27:28.304 --> 01:27:28.704]  Thank you.
[01:27:28.724 --> 01:27:32.947]  And I just had a couple points that I wanted to ask, or a couple questions I'd like to ask you about.
[01:27:33.648 --> 01:27:43.256]  Number one, Jesse Ventura has got a new book coming out in April called Don't Start the Revolution Without Me, where he is actually talking about perhaps running as a third party.
[01:27:43.276 --> 01:27:48.039]  He also said he believes the government was involved with Al-Qaeda and 9-11 attacks.
[01:27:48.099 --> 01:27:48.660]  I have the quote.
[01:27:49.352 --> 01:27:50.913]  Yeah, yeah, that's kind of amazing.
[01:27:50.953 --> 01:28:02.743]  And then also, while I was wondering what your thoughts are on him running as president, and then also what your thoughts are on, when you had Ron Paul on the radio, he mentioned about starting up some type of organization.
[01:28:02.763 --> 01:28:13.673]  Yeah, I actually know all the backside details of that, but I've been, you know, that's a private discussion with me and the Congressman and his staff, because I offer my two cents, they call and ask my two cents, and I'm honored.
[01:28:14.393 --> 01:28:23.821]  But yeah, they're sort of a national organization to fight against NAFTA, the reauthorization of it, to fight against the socialist health care, which will just give the eugenicists more control, and to fight against the war.
[01:28:23.841 --> 01:28:25.582]  Wow, that's great.
[01:28:25.602 --> 01:28:28.765]  What do you think about the whole Jesse Ventura thing, about him running for president?
[01:28:28.785 --> 01:28:30.086]  You think that's going to fly?
[01:28:30.386 --> 01:28:32.488]  I think he's a lot better than the candidates we've got.
[01:28:32.508 --> 01:28:35.390]  I have to say, I don't entirely trust Jesse Ventura.
[01:28:35.751 --> 01:28:37.912]  But we'll be talking to him soon, that's all I'm going to say there.
[01:28:38.253 --> 01:28:39.834]  And we've got some other big guests coming up.
[01:28:39.894 --> 01:28:41.295]  I've interviewed Yovit Ventura before.
[01:28:42.236 --> 01:28:43.637]  I think we have a full hour.
[01:28:44.572 --> 01:28:47.894]  Uh, let's go ahead now and talk to Jeremy.
[01:28:48.255 --> 01:28:49.215]  Jeremy, you're on the air.
[01:28:49.235 --> 01:28:49.676]  Go ahead.
[01:28:50.436 --> 01:28:52.037]  Thank you, Alex, for opening my eyes.
[01:28:52.938 --> 01:28:54.859]  And, uh, mine's two-part.
[01:28:54.899 --> 01:28:57.601]  Number one, uh, I wanted to get your opinion on
[01:28:58.263 --> 01:29:06.729]  You know anything about the Wisconsin State Newborn Screening Law and also a prediction versus McCain and Governor Perry running on a two-ticket?
[01:29:06.749 --> 01:29:07.529]  Well, there's several.
[01:29:07.549 --> 01:29:17.096]  Wisconsin's the main pilot state in a lot of things, like live-time cell phone tracking by the feds at the integration center, but what specifically about the newborn screening?
[01:29:17.736 --> 01:29:24.661]  Well, I'm a new, first-time daddy, and we went through Lamaze class at the local hospital.
[01:29:25.276 --> 01:29:30.199]  They took us on a tour of the hospital, and the nurse... And they told you what?
[01:29:30.819 --> 01:29:33.040]  Well, they said it's a mandatory law.
[01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:35.281]  They even showed it, brought a little newborn in.
[01:29:35.481 --> 01:29:40.184]  Well, he got pricked here for his hepatitis, and I said, what's that on the heel?
[01:29:40.564 --> 01:29:42.825]  And she said, oh, that's the screening law.
[01:29:43.125 --> 01:29:44.366]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:29:44.406 --> 01:29:47.687]  Sir, they send that to an international DNA database.
[01:29:48.007 --> 01:29:51.029]  Anyone 34 years younger is in an illegal database.
[01:29:52.731 --> 01:29:55.252]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:29:55.592 --> 01:29:56.872]  Loose Change, Final Cut.
[01:29:57.152 --> 01:29:59.133]  Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:29:59.293 --> 01:30:01.034]  The Truth Story of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:30:01.194 --> 01:30:02.434]  The Late Great USA.
[01:30:02.674 --> 01:30:04.094]  America, Freedom to Fascism.
[01:30:04.455 --> 01:30:11.297]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.
[01:30:11.477 --> 01:30:15.398]  When you visit prisonplanet.com, you can connect to our amazing online store.
[01:30:15.558 --> 01:30:18.939]  Whether you're looking for survival and wellness products like Berkey water filters,
[01:30:19.379 --> 01:30:19.639]  I think so.
[01:30:49.119 --> 01:30:49.980]  I think so.
[01:31:08.559 --> 01:31:22.747]  When the dollar and economy crash, when the imported and genetically poisoned food is all that's left, when the quarantine and bird flu hit, our only protection and only chance to be fearless is having control of our own supply of food and enough of it.
[01:31:23.007 --> 01:31:30.692]  But if you knew what we haven't yet discovered, you wouldn't waste time listening to the rest of this announcement before charging out and getting a serious food supply.
[01:31:31.232 --> 01:31:34.054]  Decide, it's food now or probably never.
[01:31:34.454 --> 01:31:35.715]  But can you afford to be wrong?
[01:31:36.395 --> 01:31:37.096]  Decide now.
[01:31:37.577 --> 01:31:38.378]  Place your bet.
[01:31:39.158 --> 01:31:40.620]  Can you afford to be wrong?
[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:42.402]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:42.422 --> 01:31:42.582]  Call 800-409-5633.
[01:31:53.596 --> 01:31:55.338]  Ladies and gentlemen, please pay attention.
[01:31:55.579 --> 01:31:56.860]  Ron Paul did not quit.
[01:31:57.060 --> 01:31:58.062]  He is still in the race.
[01:31:58.442 --> 01:32:01.726]  Most Americans do not understand how the election process works.
[01:32:02.167 --> 01:32:03.208]  The media is lying.
[01:32:03.668 --> 01:32:06.232]  John McCain does not have the Republican nomination.
[01:32:06.612 --> 01:32:09.335]  The popular vote is just a straw poll, believe it or not.
[01:32:09.736 --> 01:32:12.900]  The delegates have the power over the elections, not the voters.
[01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:17.703]  After the mainstream media wrote a hit piece on how Ron Paul quit, many supporters quit as well.
[01:32:18.263 --> 01:32:23.166]  Ron Paul has stated he will continue his run for presidency, as long as he has your continued support.
[01:32:23.626 --> 01:32:24.647]  Ron Paul has a plan.
[01:32:24.927 --> 01:32:31.211]  The delegates have not yet been voted on, and they are voted first in county, then state, all the way to the National Convention.
[01:32:31.691 --> 01:32:36.134]  Go to our website at RonPaulFlags.com and click on Why Ron Paul Will Win.
[01:32:36.654 --> 01:32:40.119]  That's RonPaulFlags.com to find out more on how delegates work.
[01:32:40.559 --> 01:32:41.300]  Stand your ground.
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:43.663]  Go for the win and fly a Ron Paul flag today.
[01:32:43.943 --> 01:32:45.105]  Or call 731-664-1526 for more information.
[01:32:45.205 --> 01:32:45.465]  That's 731-664-1526.
[01:32:45.485 --> 01:32:47.588]  I need to do something about my dry heels.
[01:32:55.456 --> 01:32:56.917]  After a pedicure they look great.
[01:32:57.258 --> 01:33:01.081]  Then I have to go right back again because my feet get dry so quickly.
[01:33:01.541 --> 01:33:03.723]  Haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[01:33:04.163 --> 01:33:07.506]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[01:33:07.906 --> 01:33:10.368]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[01:33:10.869 --> 01:33:11.910]  What's that name again?
[01:33:12.310 --> 01:33:13.491]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[01:33:13.871 --> 01:33:15.032]  It's CalX.
[01:33:15.453 --> 01:33:17.274]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[01:33:17.634 --> 01:33:19.496]  What makes CalX ointment so different?
[01:33:20.262 --> 01:33:28.866]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[01:33:29.306 --> 01:33:35.029]  For soft, smooth heels and feet, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[01:33:35.409 --> 01:33:46.535]  It's diabetic friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Phyllo, Card Drug, H-E-B grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[01:33:47.208 --> 01:33:48.309]  Hey, here's a drug store.
[01:33:48.629 --> 01:33:49.309]  I'll be right back.
[01:33:49.429 --> 01:33:51.170]  I'm getting some Calix for my heels.
[01:33:55.352 --> 01:33:58.014]  You're listening to GCN.
[01:33:58.034 --> 01:34:01.676]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:34:01.996 --> 01:34:13.602]  Alright, I gotta hit financial news and I'll try to jam in Ted and Texas and others, Rick, Leon, JD.
[01:34:13.662 --> 01:34:15.563]  You'll at least get about a minute or so.
[01:34:17.233 --> 01:34:18.594]  Tomorrow I'll tell this even more.
[01:34:18.634 --> 01:34:19.534]  This is so huge.
[01:34:19.634 --> 01:34:23.076]  But it's just going to be an ongoing, unfolding situation.
[01:34:24.077 --> 01:34:26.338]  The New World Order is raping the living daylights out of us.
[01:34:26.859 --> 01:34:29.120]  I mean, they're making their move.
[01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:31.381]  Let me boil it down before I get into the financial news.
[01:34:31.421 --> 01:34:32.022]  Make it very simple.
[01:34:33.234 --> 01:34:40.479]  Private banking families own our private central banks over Europe, over Asia, over the United States, over Canada, over Mexico.
[01:34:40.539 --> 01:34:41.179]  It's a cartel.
[01:34:41.579 --> 01:34:43.641]  It's a cartel over oil, a cartel over diamonds.
[01:34:44.121 --> 01:34:44.781]  It's a cartel.
[01:34:44.841 --> 01:34:47.023]  It's a group forming a monopoly together.
[01:34:47.043 --> 01:34:48.003]  It's an oligopoly.
[01:34:48.203 --> 01:34:50.565]  But the mechanism of an oligopoly is a cartel.
[01:34:51.566 --> 01:34:58.470]  And they totally and completely control the world's money supply.
[01:34:58.570 --> 01:35:01.652]  And they decided to give out unlimited credit, unlimited liquidity,
[01:35:02.358 --> 01:35:04.199]  But they gave most of that to their own firms.
[01:35:04.259 --> 01:35:19.383]  They went out and bought up the water districts, the power plants, the roads, the governments, the infrastructure, the ports, the diamond mines, the gold mines, the oil refineries, the oil fields, the nickel cadmium fields, the platinum fields, the palladium fields.
[01:35:19.423 --> 01:35:20.523]  They bought it all up.
[01:35:22.259 --> 01:35:27.163]  Now they're coming in with a global government, with a global tax on all carbon emissions from humans.
[01:35:27.423 --> 01:35:28.864]  No real toxic waste will be reduced.
[01:35:29.104 --> 01:35:42.594]  It's all about our emissions, with new taxes, regulators, one-child policies globally that the globalists paid China in 1975 to put in place, total micromanagement, shutting down the family farms and ranches.
[01:35:42.654 --> 01:35:43.474]  It's all been announced.
[01:35:43.814 --> 01:35:45.616]  It's all happening with regulators right now.
[01:35:45.636 --> 01:35:48.838]  I mean, folks, hell is being released right now, okay?
[01:35:49.078 --> 01:35:50.139]  You think stuff's bad now.
[01:35:50.379 --> 01:35:51.700]  You ain't seen nothing yet.
[01:35:52.739 --> 01:35:55.700]  Okay, but each compartmentalized group is brainwashed thinking it's good.
[01:35:56.141 --> 01:35:58.121]  Now, the banks went in and bought everything real.
[01:35:58.742 --> 01:36:06.225]  They moved it in the last five years to offshore corporations, to global bodies, and into private companies they own over commodities.
[01:36:06.565 --> 01:36:07.385]  Raw material.
[01:36:07.806 --> 01:36:09.246]  Timber, oil, gold, okay?
[01:36:10.767 --> 01:36:14.308]  Now, they're going to implode all the big major banks right in front of you.
[01:36:14.549 --> 01:36:15.989]  That's to steal your pension funds.
[01:36:16.209 --> 01:36:18.170]  That's to make sure you get nothing for your stocks.
[01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:19.251]  Just like Enron.
[01:36:19.271 --> 01:36:19.991]  It was a test.
[01:36:20.598 --> 01:36:22.299]  They'll send a few CEOs to prison.
[01:36:22.679 --> 01:36:26.982]  A few little nobodies like, uh, or, you know, others will die after they're convicted, like Ken Lay.
[01:36:27.202 --> 01:36:27.982]  Oh, heart attack, sure.
[01:36:28.182 --> 01:36:28.923]  The day I got convicted.
[01:36:28.943 --> 01:36:30.144]  You know, up in Canada.
[01:36:30.584 --> 01:36:31.364]  I mean, up in Colorado.
[01:36:31.785 --> 01:36:32.485]  At the ski resort.
[01:36:33.165 --> 01:36:38.709]  Or they'll send somebody who didn't do anything, like Martha Stewart, who's like a fly on the hind end of an elephant.
[01:36:38.949 --> 01:36:40.149]  The elephant's causing the crime.
[01:36:40.390 --> 01:36:41.670]  You're looking at the fly.
[01:36:42.851 --> 01:36:44.492]  And so they had unlimited money.
[01:36:44.592 --> 01:36:45.693]  They bought everything up.
[01:36:46.133 --> 01:36:49.575]  Now, to, quote, pay off the debts that they've accrued and that we've accrued,
[01:36:50.399 --> 01:36:52.820]  And we were dumb to take it, dumb to buy into the fiat system.
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.881]  You know, we were the suckers, but they're going to try to blame us now.
[01:36:57.141 --> 01:37:00.002]  They are now going to devalue the dollar down to almost zero.
[01:37:00.102 --> 01:37:07.204]  Now, the dollar's already been devalued, depending on how you cut it, by 66%, or if, or no, 70%, or if you look at it with Euro parity, by 56%.
[01:37:12.498 --> 01:37:14.799]  We've only felt about 20% of that devaluation.
[01:37:14.859 --> 01:37:17.580]  It always comes at the nation that devalues last.
[01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:18.660]  It'll hit us last.
[01:37:18.900 --> 01:37:20.441]  But God, it's gonna hit us the hardest.
[01:37:21.441 --> 01:37:33.285]  That means everybody on Social Security is gonna have their purchasing value taken and they're not gonna up the value of the check according to true CPI, according to true inflation.
[01:37:35.026 --> 01:37:36.826]  People tell me, well, I don't own stocks.
[01:37:38.227 --> 01:37:39.127]  You don't own stocks?
[01:37:39.167 --> 01:37:41.228]  People that do own companies you work for.
[01:37:42.003 --> 01:37:48.769]  If they don't have money off stock dividends or profits, they're not going to have money to come in your coffee shop, or come in your bar, or come in your clothing store.
[01:37:50.010 --> 01:38:01.200]  When commodities, when oil's at $110, going to go up to $175 by the end of the year, every major commodities group is saying, that's going to more than triple the cost of shipping things to you, and energy.
[01:38:01.380 --> 01:38:02.721]  Do you understand what's happening?
[01:38:04.833 --> 01:38:11.718]  And then last week, the White House Press Secretary, the media was asking her, is it a conspiracy theory, or is it true the dollar's devalued?
[01:38:12.018 --> 01:38:13.419]  And that's why the oil's so much.
[01:38:13.739 --> 01:38:16.140]  Like we need the White House to tell us!
[01:38:16.501 --> 01:38:18.402]  Of course it's they devalued the dollar!
[01:38:18.862 --> 01:38:20.403]  But the public's so dumb!
[01:38:20.583 --> 01:38:22.124]  The reporters are so dumb!
[01:38:22.344 --> 01:38:24.546]  They have to, and she says, I'll be fired if I tell you.
[01:38:25.306 --> 01:38:26.227]  Like we're idiots.
[01:38:26.527 --> 01:38:29.069]  Like we have to have the White House tell us, that's why.
[01:38:29.745 --> 01:38:33.928]  I was freaking out six years ago when they had a 20% dollar devaluation.
[01:38:34.368 --> 01:38:35.970]  Now it's 60 plus percent?
[01:38:40.433 --> 01:38:44.215]  I mean, folks, this is going to make the Great Depression look like a game of Pinochle.
[01:38:45.937 --> 01:38:46.877]  I'm not just saying that.
[01:38:46.957 --> 01:38:47.338]  I mean it.
[01:38:47.398 --> 01:38:48.699]  And they did it all by design.
[01:38:49.079 --> 01:38:51.521]  I brought you Joseph Stiklitz, head of the World Bank.
[01:38:51.741 --> 01:38:56.624]  When he saw the documents in 2002 where they were going to do this to the U.S., he said, I won't be part of it and quit.
[01:38:56.644 --> 01:38:57.485]  The documents came out.
[01:38:58.746 --> 01:39:00.727]  They plan to have riots in the U.S.
[01:39:00.807 --> 01:39:01.948]  It's public documents.
[01:39:02.228 --> 01:39:03.648]  They mean to bring our economy down.
[01:39:03.668 --> 01:39:04.389]  They call it the IMF riot.
[01:39:04.409 --> 01:39:05.429]  They've done it everywhere else.
[01:39:05.449 --> 01:39:06.730]  It's so bad.
[01:39:06.970 --> 01:39:12.533]  They want to turn the power and water off, so you riot, and then they have an excuse to bring martial law in.
[01:39:12.873 --> 01:39:14.674]  So bad, we never come out of it.
[01:39:15.434 --> 01:39:17.555]  You understand, this is a shake-and-bake operation.
[01:39:17.875 --> 01:39:18.876]  They do it all the time.
[01:39:20.555 --> 01:39:21.576]  Just like Argentina.
[01:39:21.836 --> 01:39:28.839]  They were as high a standard of living as us, and within one week, they were one of the lowest standard of livings in Central and South America.
[01:39:31.061 --> 01:39:32.521]  I just can't handle it anymore, folks.
[01:39:33.042 --> 01:39:37.624]  And yuppies are just now figuring out gold's good and other commodities are good?
[01:39:38.384 --> 01:39:41.466]  If we politically knew who was behind this, they wouldn't pull it off.
[01:39:41.726 --> 01:39:47.149]  If we don't politically figure out who's doing this, and let them know we're going to hold the bankers accountable, it's over.
[01:39:48.186 --> 01:39:56.828]  The government isn't trying to shore up the economy by cutting interest rates and by going around having the Fed chairman bad-mouth the dollar globally.
[01:39:56.848 --> 01:40:04.069]  That's killing the dollar while telling you it's safe politically and making sure you go down with the ship and making sure you end up getting left holding the bag.
[01:40:04.450 --> 01:40:05.890]  Weak dollar costs U.S.
[01:40:05.930 --> 01:40:07.370]  economy its number one spot.
[01:40:07.670 --> 01:40:08.690]  Reuters today.
[01:40:09.371 --> 01:40:09.711]  The U.S.
[01:40:09.751 --> 01:40:15.852]  economy lost the title of the world's biggest to the Eurozone this week as the value of the dollar slumped in currency markets.
[01:40:16.858 --> 01:40:21.269]  Just our dollar going down now makes us behind Europe, and we're about to slip behind China.
[01:40:21.469 --> 01:40:23.594]  We ain't number one no more, okay?
[01:40:23.794 --> 01:40:25.258]  Just wanted to give you that news flash.
[01:40:25.538 --> 01:40:25.899]  Reuters.
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:27.042]  Here's another one.
[01:40:27.819 --> 01:40:29.740]  Fears for world economy as major U.S.
[01:40:29.801 --> 01:40:31.142]  banks bailed out.
[01:40:31.282 --> 01:40:32.002]  London Independent.
[01:40:32.402 --> 01:40:33.143]  What does that mean?
[01:40:33.223 --> 01:40:38.107]  It means they're going to imprint more money and issue more currency and issue more liquidity.
[01:40:38.407 --> 01:40:39.728]  Hundreds of billions a week.
[01:40:40.288 --> 01:40:41.649]  Hundreds of billions a week!
[01:40:42.150 --> 01:40:44.411]  That only devalues what's in your bank!
[01:40:44.732 --> 01:40:47.374]  You're not just going to have to pay taxes later to bail these banks out.
[01:40:47.994 --> 01:40:50.176]  You're going to have to have your money devalued.
[01:40:50.876 --> 01:40:53.338]  What are you going to do when you find out your pension's toilet paper?
[01:40:53.498 --> 01:40:57.121]  You'll probably blame me and worship Fox News or something, you liberal commies.
[01:40:57.791 --> 01:40:58.935]  You don't even know you're a commie.
[01:40:58.955 --> 01:40:59.958]  You're the ultimate commie.
[01:41:00.138 --> 01:41:01.602]  The ultimate brainwashed idiot.
[01:41:02.044 --> 01:41:05.514]  Fears for world economy as major banks bailed out.
[01:41:06.630 --> 01:41:08.931]  Wall Street fears for next Great Depression.
[01:41:08.971 --> 01:41:16.353]  London Independent Wall Street is bracing itself for another week of rollercoaster trading after more than $300 billion was wiped off the U.S.
[01:41:16.433 --> 01:41:24.756]  equity markets on Friday following the emergency funding package put together by the Federal Reserve and JPMorgan Chase to reassure Bear Stearns.
[01:41:25.116 --> 01:41:30.617]  By the way, Bush, the Bin Ladens, and the Queen of England are the majority owners of Carlyle, hundreds of billions.
[01:41:30.978 --> 01:41:33.598]  They aren't going to now finance their debt.
[01:41:33.838 --> 01:41:35.679]  They're going under, but they aren't going under.
[01:41:35.879 --> 01:41:37.544]  They ran the S&L crisis in the 80s and 90s.
[01:41:39.039 --> 01:41:40.080]  Silverado, all of it.
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:46.105]  They already moved in the last five years out into European stocks and into foreign currencies and commodities.
[01:41:46.406 --> 01:41:48.187]  They're just burning down the bar, folks.
[01:41:48.387 --> 01:41:55.934]  Just like in Goodfellas, where they run whiskey in the back door, run it out the front, launder the money, and when they're done, they burn the place down and take the insurance.
[01:41:56.154 --> 01:41:58.736]  They're burning America down and taking the insurance.
[01:41:58.897 --> 01:42:03.501]  And if you get out and riot in the street, they've already delivered microwave guns to every major police department.
[01:42:03.601 --> 01:42:06.183]  They're going to roll those out and microwave your butts in the street.
[01:42:07.054 --> 01:42:13.617]  And they'll have the cops on the news saying what heroes they are when those cops are losing their whole future and their families are losing their whole future.
[01:42:14.198 --> 01:42:19.680]  But they won't care because they get to be the winner of the winning team.
[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:21.361]  Look, I'm not against the police.
[01:42:21.441 --> 01:42:22.922]  I'm tired of you getting conned.
[01:42:23.202 --> 01:42:24.783]  I mean, I heard a local talk show host this week
[01:42:25.513 --> 01:42:28.896]  Saying that the government doesn't ship drugs in and they just can't believe it?
[01:42:29.156 --> 01:42:30.597]  It doesn't matter what you believe!
[01:42:31.037 --> 01:42:40.964]  The CIA solicitor, Select General Inspector, came out and admitted the government ships in most of the drugs, and then attacks cartels that don't launder their money through U.S.
[01:42:41.004 --> 01:42:41.304]  banks.
[01:42:41.585 --> 01:42:42.425]  That's how it works.
[01:42:42.685 --> 01:42:43.806]  You don't launder your money.
[01:42:44.427 --> 01:42:54.394]  They sent Richard Grasso, the head of the New York Stock Exchange in 99, front page of AP and Reuters Newswire, to hug the head of the FARC guerrilla and tell him, if you don't invest your money with us, we're going to kill you.
[01:42:56.346 --> 01:42:58.647]  Of course, it's public that they launder all the money.
[01:42:59.267 --> 01:43:01.388]  It's public that government controls the drug trade.
[01:43:03.169 --> 01:43:05.230]  Stop being so naive, man!
[01:43:05.270 --> 01:43:06.230]  This is real!
[01:43:07.611 --> 01:43:08.551]  This isn't a joke!
[01:43:08.811 --> 01:43:09.912]  This is our whole future!
[01:43:10.112 --> 01:43:11.473]  Criminals run everything!
[01:43:12.233 --> 01:43:14.814]  And if we don't turn this around, they're going to have their way with us.
[01:43:16.721 --> 01:43:23.684]  One UK economist warned that the world is now close to a 1930s-like Great Depression, while New York traders said they had never experienced such fear.
[01:43:24.004 --> 01:43:31.087]  The Fed's emergency funding procedure was first used in the Depression, and has rarely been used since.
[01:43:31.347 --> 01:43:33.248]  And it was the Fed that brought us into that Depression.
[01:43:33.468 --> 01:43:35.089]  That's been declassified by design.
[01:43:35.869 --> 01:43:38.551]  Everyone is in a total state of shock, aghast at what is happening.
[01:43:38.851 --> 01:43:40.551]  No one wants to talk, let alone deal.
[01:43:40.752 --> 01:43:42.092]  We're just standing by, waiting.
[01:43:42.372 --> 01:43:43.933]  Everyone's nervous about what's happening.
[01:43:45.083 --> 01:43:47.884]  Now the question is, is it a bad recession or a depression?
[01:43:48.144 --> 01:44:01.249]  Folks, I told you three years ago that our moles inside Bilderberg, and I made a film with footage from two and a half years ago, where I told you they were going to implode the housing market by design because they wanted to do this.
[01:44:01.589 --> 01:44:07.552]  I told you they were going to do this on purpose to consolidate and bring in a police state crackdown.
[01:44:07.752 --> 01:44:11.333]  They want you like those poor Tibetans that have no money, that have no nothing.
[01:44:12.037 --> 01:44:14.379]  Look to fight back against tanks with sticks and stones.
[01:44:14.879 --> 01:44:17.221]  The Supreme Court's about to rule there's no Second Amendment.
[01:44:17.241 --> 01:44:23.206]  They're gonna double-spin it, though, and claim it was a ruling for it, but then they're gonna say, but we can still restrict it, which is actually a restriction.
[01:44:23.667 --> 01:44:24.347]  Get ready for that.
[01:44:24.407 --> 01:44:25.488]  I'm sorry to all the other callers.
[01:44:25.668 --> 01:44:26.449]  We're out of time.
[01:44:26.649 --> 01:44:28.310]  Back next Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:44:28.351 --> 01:44:32.634]  Central, and, of course, worldwide, Monday morning at InfoWars.com.
[01:44:32.894 --> 01:44:33.915]  Never surrender!
[01:44:33.995 --> 01:44:35.917]  The New World Order's attacking the Republic!
[01:44:36.097 --> 01:44:37.138]  Take off your blinders!
[01:44:37.338 --> 01:44:38.199]  Admit I'm right!
[01:44:38.439 --> 01:44:39.320]  Fight them with me!
[01:44:39.660 --> 01:44:40.180]  Fight them!
[01:44:40.380 --> 01:44:40.701]  Yeah!
[01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:43.670]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:44:43.730 --> 01:44:46.892]  As you know, GCN is a huge supporter of Ron Paul and all he stands for.
[01:44:46.992 --> 01:44:55.438]  That's why, for a limited time, I have personally set aside commercial inventory allowing advertisers the chance to show their personal support for Ron Paul while promoting their products.
[01:44:55.458 --> 01:45:01.822]  If you would like to voice your support for Ron Paul's march to the White House and have thought about advertising on GCN, give us a call at 877-996-4327.
[01:45:01.842 --> 01:45:04.684]  That's 877-996-4327 or go to GCNlive.com today and click on the Support Ron Paul link on our homepage.
[01:45:14.189 --> 01:45:15.210]  Looking for profit?
[01:45:15.270 --> 01:45:16.650]  Looking for safety and security?
[01:45:16.910 --> 01:45:20.211]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[01:45:20.251 --> 01:45:27.813]  This low-mintage collector coin, with a total series mintage under $600,000, has sold at four times its current price.
[01:45:27.873 --> 01:45:31.594]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[01:45:31.634 --> 01:45:33.135]  Secure your position today.
[01:45:33.455 --> 01:45:34.695]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:45:34.715 --> 01:45:34.975]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:45:42.696 --> 01:45:43.524]  We at the Bible.
