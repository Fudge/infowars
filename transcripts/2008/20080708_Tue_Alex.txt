[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:00.329]  I think so.
[00:00:30.206 --> 00:00:35.671]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:37.233]  And we knew what to do.
[00:00:37.253 --> 00:00:39.014]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:00:39.254 --> 00:00:45.660]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:00:46.281 --> 00:00:51.466]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement.
[00:00:52.418 --> 00:00:54.800]  That the air was safe to breathe.
[00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:09.932]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global... We are live at PrisonPlanet.tv for viewers.
[00:01:11.393 --> 00:01:15.476]  We'll keep rolling for Chuck Baldwin and then Dr. Paul Chris Roberts.
[00:01:16.077 --> 00:01:19.460]  Burmess is going to be in studio for a segment or so, a BBC hit piece.
[00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:23.861]  Edit Silverstein comments in Dirty Tricks Scam.
[00:01:24.402 --> 00:01:27.284]  We'll put that article up on screen for everybody.
[00:01:27.304 --> 00:01:29.125]  And this is only one facet of it.
[00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:36.231]  Watching this last night, every 30 seconds had total disinfo, total lies, total fraud.
[00:01:36.771 --> 00:01:39.173]  There's no way this guy couldn't know what he was doing.
[00:01:39.213 --> 00:01:43.797]  There's no way making a film about Building 7 that you couldn't know what it was.
[00:01:44.277 --> 00:01:50.482]  Unless the person is just an abject denial, you know, to the level of some guy walks in and his wife is in bed.
[00:01:51.382 --> 00:01:52.122]  It's hypothetical.
[00:01:52.622 --> 00:02:02.204]  With another man in the act, with no sheets over him, and he sees the full, you know, penetration, I hate to get graphic here, and just says, you know what?
[00:02:02.304 --> 00:02:03.505]  That's not sex!
[00:02:03.885 --> 00:02:04.505]  Hello, honey!
[00:02:04.545 --> 00:02:13.547]  And they're there going after it, and he just walks by and, you know, gets a glass of water out of the refrigerator by the bed and, you know, just says, well, honey, I'll see you in a little while, I'm going out to play golf.
[00:02:14.707 --> 00:02:17.509]  I mean, it's just getting to the point where it's mind-blowing.
[00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.710]  Back to... I'm sorry for that analogy.
[00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.891]  I'm out of control and I apologize deeply.
[00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:23.712]  And I will not do it again.
[00:02:23.832 --> 00:02:28.234]  Paul Davis, one of the chief organizers taking action.
[00:02:28.594 --> 00:02:29.795]  Ron Paul meet up here in Austin.
[00:02:29.835 --> 00:02:31.036]  I can't tell you how excited I am.
[00:02:31.696 --> 00:02:46.582]  To see the fact that at universities and in major cities and small towns, the meet-up groups, in some cases with thousands of members, are just taking to the streets for 9-11 truth, fighting the North American Union, fighting against land grabs, fighting against attacks on free speech.
[00:02:47.282 --> 00:02:55.484]  I mean, this is exciting, not just letting this huge grassroots movement dissipate, but actually in some areas growing right now.
[00:02:55.764 --> 00:03:01.725]  And yes, I'd seen that the police department a few days ago said, look, we've got concerns, we don't like this.
[00:03:02.545 --> 00:03:06.966]  Again, go to the police and say, come on, shake yourself, splash some water on your face.
[00:03:07.666 --> 00:03:10.127]  You know, it's in the name of goodness.
[00:03:11.207 --> 00:03:15.908]  Now they want to put Toyota and Ford, say, by 2011, all cars will have breathalyzers?
[00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:24.022]  And then you'll get a false alarm and they call the police on you and they come via the cell phone that's built into your OnStar type system.
[00:03:24.582 --> 00:03:25.863]  I mean, this is Big Brother.
[00:03:26.503 --> 00:03:28.784]  This is not about stopping drinking or drunk driving.
[00:03:29.284 --> 00:03:32.426]  I mean, again, the illegal aliens are above the law and they don't get arrested for drunk driving.
[00:03:33.406 --> 00:03:36.768]  Tell us, again, for those that don't know, the Austin Police Department doesn't like this.
[00:03:37.408 --> 00:03:38.388]  And this is nationwide.
[00:03:38.428 --> 00:03:43.931]  The feds are doing this grant to get you used to guys in uniforms carrying out medical procedures on you.
[00:03:44.131 --> 00:03:46.032]  This is getting you ready for forced inoculations.
[00:03:46.052 --> 00:03:46.392]  Go ahead.
[00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:58.679]  Yeah, here in the KXAN article, it talks about it, that the Austin Police Association has concerns about it, issues and concerns.
[00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.542]  Of course, it says they're not ready to take a position on the issue.
[00:04:02.962 --> 00:04:05.944]  But, you know, civil rights groups are speaking out about this.
[00:04:06.285 --> 00:04:09.447]  There's even officers within the police department that are like, whoa, man.
[00:04:10.248 --> 00:04:12.089]  So it's coming from every side on this.
[00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:13.290]  I mean, this is just crazy.
[00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:38.970]  Well it certainly is and I hope a lot of people come out there tonight at six o'clock and of course the police will babble for thirty minutes and then take questions and the community leaders will have to sit up there and drone and try to keep their slaves in line but it'll finally be the time for the slaves to be able to speak to the god men and just let the god men know they're helping destroy the republic and that they better not be a part of this criminal operation.
[00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.754]  Again, give out the address to the Ron Paul Meetup Group here in Austin.
[00:04:43.968 --> 00:04:48.595]  It is ronpaul.meetup.com with the board slash 14.
[00:04:48.695 --> 00:04:50.397]  Number 14.
[00:04:50.778 --> 00:04:52.661]  Good to have you on Paul, appreciate it.
[00:04:52.701 --> 00:04:58.068]  Call tomorrow, or let me get you on for 5-10 minutes tomorrow to give us a report on what happened.
[00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.630]  I'll do it brother.
[00:05:00.114 --> 00:05:00.875]  Thanks a lot, Paul.
[00:05:01.856 --> 00:05:06.080]  Okay, again we have Chuck Baldwin, presidential candidate for the Constitution Party, coming up.
[00:05:07.201 --> 00:05:12.767]  We will also ask him about being a pastor, being approached by the Feds to help with the FEMA Roundup plans.
[00:05:13.147 --> 00:05:15.329]  You know, he talked about that too before that was in the news.
[00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.072]  Now that's in the news, I'm going to bring that up to Chuck Baldwin as well.
[00:05:19.053 --> 00:05:20.834]  And then Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:05:21.235 --> 00:05:22.736]  For the rest of the hour, I want to talk 9-11.
[00:05:23.036 --> 00:05:30.162]  And before we get into the BBC's ridiculous, falling-flat-on-their-face story, Jason, Truth Rising is out.
[00:05:31.344 --> 00:05:32.884]  And I want everyone to get it.
[00:05:32.904 --> 00:05:35.625]  The DVD is out, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:36.505 --> 00:05:39.446]  It is an absolute must-see.
[00:05:39.986 --> 00:05:43.367]  You saw us for months while you've been here working, finishing the film.
[00:05:44.387 --> 00:05:49.688]  I want you, in your own words, because I know you're a big fan of it behind the scenes, to describe what this film covers.
[00:05:49.708 --> 00:05:51.128]  Because it isn't just about 9-11 truth.
[00:05:51.168 --> 00:05:52.309]  It isn't just about the police state.
[00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:53.669]  It isn't just about how the
[00:05:54.429 --> 00:05:55.830]  government stage the attacks.
[00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.010]  I mean, it's more than that.
[00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.691]  It shows a revolution against tyranny.
[00:06:00.011 --> 00:06:01.572]  It shows how we're being demonized.
[00:06:02.272 --> 00:06:12.156]  I mean, this is really a testament to who we are, to also protect the 9-11 truth movement, and to basically set bushfires in the minds of men, as Thomas Jefferson said.
[00:06:12.477 --> 00:06:13.357]  Berman, it's your take on it.
[00:06:13.777 --> 00:06:21.345]  Yeah man, it shows the power of one person and then us grouping together and going against that which some seem to think is impossible, but it's not.
[00:06:21.365 --> 00:06:23.147]  These are human beings that we're confronting.
[00:06:23.167 --> 00:06:29.513]  It shows that no matter what echelon of power you're at in government or media, you too can be brought to justice.
[00:06:29.714 --> 00:06:30.635]  And it just shows me
[00:06:31.195 --> 00:06:42.323]  Hope for our next generation as Luke Rudowsky, yourself, We Are Change Colorado, Minnesota, Student Scholars for 9-11 Truth, all go after these guys, man.
[00:06:42.584 --> 00:06:46.146]  It's just so heartening to see them being called on their lies.
[00:06:46.186 --> 00:06:51.070]  I mean, Willie Brown being confronted about his San Francisco Chronicle early warning article.
[00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.973]  For instance, Gary Hart being confronted on his New World Order comments.
[00:06:55.393 --> 00:07:03.795]  I mean, this film is huge, and it really, like I said, I hope the sequel is Truth Revolution, and we even take it a step further, Alex, and I know we can.
[00:07:04.335 --> 00:07:07.496]  This movie really, I mean, it shows how the cops want to set us up.
[00:07:07.916 --> 00:07:13.358]  It shows them actually trying to say that Luke is a terrorist just to get him to stop using his free speech.
[00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:19.184]  You know, like it says on the tagline there, you know, watch as the global elite tremble before the power of free speech.
[00:07:19.565 --> 00:07:20.165]  Because it's true!
[00:07:20.246 --> 00:07:28.315]  I mean, they expect us all to be asleep, Alex, and they know damn well, especially with the Secret Service being here today, you know, that we are having an effect.
[00:07:28.655 --> 00:07:30.236]  And that they're not untouchable anymore.
[00:07:30.256 --> 00:07:33.198]  I mean, how many times has Bill Clinton now been confronted about 9-11?
[00:07:33.858 --> 00:07:35.059]  It's unsurmountable.
[00:07:35.099 --> 00:07:37.220]  And Bill Clinton wasn't the president when 9-11 happened.
[00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:41.082]  That shows that people are also waking up to the false left-right paradigm.
[00:07:41.382 --> 00:07:45.805]  It's just amazing, and I think it's so encouraging, and I've seen so many positive reviews.
[00:07:46.185 --> 00:07:47.986]  And, you know, the student scholars loved it.
[00:07:48.006 --> 00:07:49.287]  They thought it was a great piece.
[00:07:49.907 --> 00:07:51.508]  It's really helping the first responders.
[00:07:51.588 --> 00:07:56.833]  It shows how the EPA lied about the air quality because these guys lie on so many levels.
[00:07:56.873 --> 00:08:00.216]  You know, they're really just out there for power and trying to make a buck.
[00:08:00.596 --> 00:08:02.638]  And they will screw us over, Alex.
[00:08:02.838 --> 00:08:05.060]  You know, we are sheeple chattel to them.
[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.102]  And it's very unfortunate that more people don't realize that.
[00:08:09.543 --> 00:08:13.807]  Well, Jason, I also just want to say concerning Truth Rising that
[00:08:15.805 --> 00:08:25.610]  I personally have made several trips to New York for free, flown up there, put on events, and helped raise in one event $14,000 for the first responders.
[00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:28.071]  And I donated my time, my airline tickets.
[00:08:28.151 --> 00:08:34.134]  It cost me just to get my guys up there for four days and pay for all their hotels and pay the crew and everything about $10,000.
[00:08:34.174 --> 00:08:36.515]  And then we got out of that $14,000 donated to them.
[00:08:36.535 --> 00:08:37.156]  This really is trying
[00:08:41.578 --> 00:08:54.787]  We're going to help them and truly tell their story, that's about a third of the film, intermixed with all the information of Inside Job and the police state, and then who we are, the 9-11 Truth Movement, fighting for everybody, because if we allow the globalists to continue to stage events, they're going to win.
[00:08:55.067 --> 00:09:03.914]  We have to expose the problem-reaction-solution system, how they stage the events, that is so key, and finally the term Inside Job, false flag,
[00:09:05.259 --> 00:09:08.781]  Self-inflicted wound is now in the nomenclature.
[00:09:08.841 --> 00:09:10.281]  It's now being used.
[00:09:10.321 --> 00:09:11.342]  It's now being understood.
[00:09:11.362 --> 00:09:15.404]  We're being attacked by all the big guns, international media, national media.
[00:09:15.864 --> 00:09:18.845]  I mean, we really are having a huge effect right now.
[00:09:19.385 --> 00:09:22.607]  And so, just for all of our safety, this film needs to be big.
[00:09:22.927 --> 00:09:30.891]  So everybody, get it at InfoWars.com or call 888-253-3139 to get your copy of that or Endgame or any of the other films.
[00:09:30.951 --> 00:09:31.491]  And please,
[00:09:32.091 --> 00:09:43.795]  I want you to get this DVD, folks, that I'm showing you on the TV program right now for PrisonPlanet.TV, folks, and I want you to get this DVD that is so high quality, so well done, and I want you to get it out to everybody.
[00:09:43.815 --> 00:09:46.775]  This film needs to be seen in its highest quality from the DVD.
[00:09:47.056 --> 00:09:51.897]  We have really good high quality up on PrisonPlanet.TV, but it's still nothing like the DVD.
[00:09:52.297 --> 00:09:57.579]  So, get this DVD in your hands and get it out to everybody, because this is a life-and-death situation.
[00:09:57.599 --> 00:10:00.980]  They would have already staged more attacks if we hadn't done what we've already done.
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.382]  And I wanted to put all of 9-11 truth in the film.
[00:10:05.803 --> 00:10:09.205]  I wanted to put everybody in all the confrontations.
[00:10:09.265 --> 00:10:13.108]  A few people have said, hey, we sent you footage, why isn't our confrontation in there?
[00:10:14.189 --> 00:10:19.593]  Folks, just watching the hundreds of hours, there's only three of us that worked on this film.
[00:10:20.353 --> 00:10:21.694]  I mean, hundreds of hours.
[00:10:21.734 --> 00:10:25.115]  That took months and months, and then more would come in as fast as we got it.
[00:10:25.976 --> 00:10:27.377]  We appreciate all of you.
[00:10:27.397 --> 00:10:28.577]  We appreciate everybody.
[00:10:29.278 --> 00:10:31.639]  But again, it isn't just about how you confronted the politicians.
[00:10:31.679 --> 00:10:33.440]  It's about exposing what they did.
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.441]  It's about helping the first responders.
[00:10:36.401 --> 00:10:41.283]  So I've been a little bit shocked by some people that have said, well, I wanted to be in your film, or why didn't you use my stuff?
[00:10:41.303 --> 00:10:43.024]  Look, we're not perfect.
[00:10:43.364 --> 00:10:44.124]  We try our best.
[00:10:44.224 --> 00:10:48.406]  I wanted to have more extras to have it all in there, but then we ran out of time on that.
[00:10:48.446 --> 00:10:52.308]  I mean, we just finished this thing about three weeks ago.
[00:10:53.519 --> 00:10:59.243]  Yeah, three weeks ago it went to be printed, it got made, and two and a half weeks later, late last week, we got these in.
[00:10:59.743 --> 00:11:01.745]  I mean, we did it by the skin of our nose.
[00:11:01.985 --> 00:11:09.470]  We were uploading it last Wednesday and Thursday before it came out on Friday to the PrisonPlanet.tv servers.
[00:11:10.611 --> 00:11:12.732]  I mean, folks, we're not God, we're not perfect.
[00:11:15.114 --> 00:11:17.257]  I've never had a film this positively received.
[00:11:17.277 --> 00:11:19.359]  I mean, usually they're about 90% positive.
[00:11:19.379 --> 00:11:21.021]  This has been like 98% positive.
[00:11:21.422 --> 00:11:24.386]  But still, people are saying, well, there's not enough about this or not enough about that.
[00:11:24.866 --> 00:11:26.048]  Try making a film first.
[00:11:26.553 --> 00:11:29.255]  You know, this is not what you... I mean, it's hard, folks.
[00:11:29.675 --> 00:11:30.956]  I mean, at least for us.
[00:11:30.976 --> 00:11:37.840]  I mean, you may be superhuman, but I do want to say that, you know, the reason I don't want this film to be criticized is it's for the first responders.
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:38.760]  Jason?
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.582]  And it's the most positive, upbeat film you've ever done, ever.
[00:11:41.602 --> 00:11:42.722]  It's a totally different style.
[00:11:42.743 --> 00:11:46.185]  I mean, let's face it, the films you make are really heavy material.
[00:11:46.325 --> 00:11:47.005]  They're scary stuff.
[00:11:47.145 --> 00:11:47.646]  Very dark.
[00:11:47.666 --> 00:11:48.666]  Yeah, very, very dark.
[00:11:49.007 --> 00:11:53.050]  And some people ask me about that sometimes, and I'm like, are you looking at the actual information?
[00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:54.652]  This is dark information.
[00:11:54.892 --> 00:11:56.113]  Wake up, it's gotta be scary.
[00:11:56.293 --> 00:12:00.597]  But this shows... Yeah, they think putting the info out made it happen, brought it into reality.
[00:12:00.917 --> 00:12:01.718]  It's already there.
[00:12:02.298 --> 00:12:03.219]  We're trying to show you.
[00:12:03.259 --> 00:12:04.361]  Yeah, we're trying to explain to you.
[00:12:04.401 --> 00:12:05.182]  Yeah, this is scary.
[00:12:05.242 --> 00:12:09.368]  Now, this is what you can do, and this is the film that shows you what you can literally do.
[00:12:09.548 --> 00:12:10.690]  You can pick up a camera.
[00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:14.395]  You know, they're a couple hundred bucks now at Walmart, and you can be the media.
[00:12:14.476 --> 00:12:18.922]  Well, people also second guess how, when a politician ignores them, then they start shouting it.
[00:12:19.362 --> 00:12:30.332]  The whole point is taking over a Bill Clinton speech or a Barack Obama speech and having them respond to 9-11 Truth to get headlines so people know there's a social consciousness that's being raised.
[00:12:30.872 --> 00:12:35.016]  And I love these armchair quarterbacks that do say, they didn't do it right, I would have done it this way.
[00:12:35.056 --> 00:12:38.439]  Well listen, listen jackass, this is life and death.
[00:12:38.479 --> 00:12:40.761]  You try having cops try to plant bombs on you.
[00:12:41.101 --> 00:12:44.004]  You get up off your butt and you go out and do something.
[00:12:44.184 --> 00:12:44.805]  Yeah, go ahead.
[00:12:44.825 --> 00:12:47.608]  You can do it your way anytime, any way you want to do it.
[00:12:47.628 --> 00:12:52.733]  I mean, I'm just saying this, you know... And by the way, that's not just a challenge to throw it back in your face.
[00:12:52.773 --> 00:12:54.435]  I mean, we need you to take action.
[00:12:54.455 --> 00:12:55.596]  We need you to do a better job.
[00:12:56.077 --> 00:12:59.400]  I bet there's a lot of filmmakers, I know there's a lot of Hollywood directors listening to this show.
[00:12:59.661 --> 00:13:00.962]  Hey, let's see you do something.
[00:13:01.222 --> 00:13:02.484]  I bet you'll do a better job than me.
[00:13:02.884 --> 00:13:03.284]  And you know what?
[00:13:03.304 --> 00:13:04.085]  I'll be promoting it.
[00:13:04.105 --> 00:13:05.927]  This is life and death for me, folks.
[00:13:06.187 --> 00:13:08.670]  This isn't about grandstanding and being a movie director.
[00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:10.392]  I'm Alex Jones and people like me.
[00:13:10.452 --> 00:13:13.315]  Frankly, I don't want to live out on a ranch somewhere and never see anybody.
[00:13:13.395 --> 00:13:14.656]  I don't frankly like people.
[00:13:15.056 --> 00:13:16.518]  I don't frankly want to hang around with you.
[00:13:16.538 --> 00:13:17.018]  You understand?
[00:13:17.259 --> 00:13:19.000]  I don't frankly want you knowing who I am.
[00:13:20.041 --> 00:13:21.502]  Well, I'm with you, Alex.
[00:13:21.522 --> 00:13:24.624]  You know, I've got a little private area in New York, too, and I like just hanging back.
[00:13:24.664 --> 00:13:30.587]  But, again, you know, if you want to beg your murderers to tell you the truth, you're very naive, in my opinion.
[00:13:30.607 --> 00:13:33.129]  You know, and that's what I really hate when I see these message boards.
[00:13:33.669 --> 00:13:35.410]  Oh, we need to not shout at these people.
[00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:41.733]  Well, if they're not going to address us in a civil manner, when we address them in a civil manner and they're not going to be truthful, you're damn right we need to get in their face.
[00:13:41.753 --> 00:13:43.094]  You're damn right we need to yell at them.
[00:13:43.374 --> 00:13:47.637]  Well, most of the time we're yelling, it's because citizens and cops are grabbing our hair.
[00:13:49.364 --> 00:13:52.585]  Or stealing our signs, or accusing us of attacking cripples.
[00:13:52.945 --> 00:13:54.365]  It's just insane, Alex.
[00:13:54.685 --> 00:13:55.045]  Insane.
[00:13:56.025 --> 00:14:00.586]  Well, you know, it's the old saying of, I complained that I had no shoes until I saw a man who had no feet.
[00:14:00.906 --> 00:14:06.167]  Well, the other cliche is, and it's a canard, but it's true, go ahead and walk a mile in our shoes, Bubba.
[00:14:06.848 --> 00:14:12.009]  You know, I love all the armchair quarterbacks that gripe about this person, or that person, or this film, or this or that.
[00:14:12.329 --> 00:14:14.509]  Hey folks, we're in a life and death situation.
[00:14:14.689 --> 00:14:17.730]  I mean, have you noticed we're going into what could be a hardcore depression?
[00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:20.671]  With a spoiled, rotten public, it's going to blow up.
[00:14:21.051 --> 00:14:22.873]  I mean, have you noticed they're getting ready to attack Iran?
[00:14:23.153 --> 00:14:24.373]  This isn't a game!
[00:14:24.674 --> 00:14:27.855]  Okay, the time to end fighting... I mean, I used to even criticize David Icke.
[00:14:28.136 --> 00:14:28.416]  You know what?
[00:14:28.436 --> 00:14:29.516]  Barry the Hatchet had him on.
[00:14:29.536 --> 00:14:30.797]  He said, I was sorry.
[00:14:30.817 --> 00:14:34.920]  Because, you know, a lot of what he says is true and good, and I just want to get along with everybody.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.460]  Our enemy's the New World Order.
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:37.281]  We're going to move forward.
[00:14:37.521 --> 00:14:42.166]  Absolutely, and he brings people into the picture, no matter, you know, how wacky some of the theories can be at the end.
[00:14:42.186 --> 00:14:44.969]  You know, I really enjoy his stuff on frequencies and all that.
[00:14:45.249 --> 00:14:49.613]  And I mean, he's dead on about the royal family, he knows about the secret societies, false flag terror.
[00:14:49.653 --> 00:14:50.634]  How the news media works.
[00:14:50.674 --> 00:14:51.675]  Okay, let's stop there.
[00:14:52.116 --> 00:14:52.737]  Jason Bermas.
[00:14:54.991 --> 00:15:07.499]  Alright, Jason Burmess is in studio with us and he has had a chance to fully, repeatedly watch the latest BBC hit piece and I had a chance to watch it last night.
[00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:14.204]  Every minute or so I had to stop it and was shaking my head, just when I think I can't be amazed.
[00:15:14.784 --> 00:15:14.924]  Yes.
[00:15:34.397 --> 00:15:45.320]  Barry Jennings, or they would, I mean, this thing, they would not show the BBC news clip in full where they're saying Building 7 has fallen, it fell in its own footprint.
[00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.301]  They would just say what she said.
[00:15:47.321 --> 00:15:50.442]  I mean, folks, and that's only one facet.
[00:15:50.882 --> 00:15:56.924]  In this segment, the next, and then the third segment before our next guest comes on, you've got five pages of notes.
[00:15:57.144 --> 00:16:00.565]  Try to quickly go through those, and then at the end, I'm going to comment on it, Jason.
[00:16:01.889 --> 00:16:03.552]  Well, let's start with Barry Jennings, first of all.
[00:16:03.772 --> 00:16:09.240]  Now, they bring Barry in very, very early, and they totally misrepresent his timeline.
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.904]  For instance, they go with the official version every time.
[00:16:12.144 --> 00:16:12.685]  In other words...
[00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:18.038]  Barry didn't get there until both planes had hit the World Trade Center.
[00:16:18.138 --> 00:16:19.018]  You watch our interview?
[00:16:19.099 --> 00:16:21.221]  No, he got there after the first plane hit.
[00:16:21.241 --> 00:16:23.122]  He was in the building prior to the second plane hit.
[00:16:23.142 --> 00:16:30.029]  But that's important, because they need their lying timeline to say that they evacuated the OEM after the second plane hit the World Trade Center.
[00:16:30.449 --> 00:16:33.953]  They also make it look like Barry Jennings was absolutely alone.
[00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:38.998]  Now, we know that Michael Hess was with him, and that's the City Corporation Council.
[00:16:39.358 --> 00:16:42.000]  Now, they actually even did a reenactment of what he did.
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:45.382]  And they don't let Barry say when he gets there or how he got up there.
[00:16:45.422 --> 00:16:47.244]  They manipulate his statements.
[00:16:48.364 --> 00:16:55.870]  On top of that, Alex, when he talks about the explosion on the sixth floor, all they let him say is the landing gave way.
[00:16:56.030 --> 00:17:01.954]  In other words, they don't let him talk about the explosion, and then they immediately go to the North Tower just fell.
[00:17:02.354 --> 00:17:04.636]  So they don't even let him tell his side of the story.
[00:17:04.676 --> 00:17:05.076]  They just say,
[00:17:06.557 --> 00:17:10.302]  These are very tight edits.
[00:17:10.342 --> 00:17:13.507]  Very tight to distort what's been said and we're video editors.
[00:17:13.587 --> 00:17:18.533]  We know when we put out the Barry Jennings it was big long clips with this very distorted.
[00:17:18.854 --> 00:17:20.616]  Absolutely and they actually did a reenactment.
[00:17:20.936 --> 00:17:23.199]  That was the only part where there was an actual reenactment.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:36.107]  So, they gloss over the fact that he's with Michael Hess, they gloss over his timeline, they gloss over the fact that he says that he was in the building when both towers fell on that 8th floor after the explosion, which was an explosion inside the building.
[00:17:36.127 --> 00:17:36.668]  That is key.
[00:17:36.708 --> 00:17:43.932]  There was an explosion before Tower 1 or 2, the North and South Tower fell, and they all slickly edited that so that you don't get that.
[00:17:44.392 --> 00:17:44.933]  Absolutely.
[00:17:45.173 --> 00:17:50.178]  Alright, let's move on to other facets of this total hit piece.
[00:17:50.458 --> 00:17:53.021]  For instance, they say that Building 7 took a direct hit.
[00:17:53.061 --> 00:18:04.592]  Now, they do actually show the video inside Building 7 that we have, where they go up the escalator, but then they cut away and they say that it showed massive damage on the south side of the building.
[00:18:04.692 --> 00:18:05.113]  No, it didn't.
[00:18:05.413 --> 00:18:07.195]  There were a couple of doors that were blown out.
[00:18:07.475 --> 00:18:07.916]  That was it.
[00:18:08.036 --> 00:18:12.341]  And they don't, well blown out, not in it, and they don't show the massive damage.
[00:18:12.461 --> 00:18:14.644]  No, absolutely, because there is no massive damage.
[00:18:14.764 --> 00:18:15.465]  We have the footage.
[00:18:15.665 --> 00:18:15.865]  Yes.
[00:18:16.386 --> 00:18:20.651]  Another dirty trick that they played is that they said that they had new photographs and they had this photographer there.
[00:18:20.971 --> 00:18:23.194]  Now, they don't have the photograph scanned in, so they don't edit.
[00:18:23.214 --> 00:18:26.458]  They literally have the guy holding the photograph and they kind of zoom in on it.
[00:18:26.478 --> 00:18:27.199]  It's shaky cam.
[00:18:28.039 --> 00:18:29.520]  Which makes it even more deceptive.
[00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:30.420]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:30.841]  Stay there.
[00:18:30.881 --> 00:18:32.361]  I want to get to this when we get back, folks.
[00:18:32.481 --> 00:18:34.963]  I mean, I think they've completely blown it.
[00:18:35.183 --> 00:18:39.445]  I mean, what they've produced will create a thousand times more questions.
[00:18:39.525 --> 00:18:42.587]  It's like they wanted to act suspicious and deceptive.
[00:18:43.107 --> 00:18:45.608]  It's almost like they're on our side, but we know they're not.
[00:18:45.908 --> 00:18:49.930]  It's just the enemy, that's who they've got, is these quacks, these nobodies.
[00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:52.872]  I mean, these guys, they're charlatans.
[00:18:52.892 --> 00:18:56.394]  We'll be right back with Jason Bermas as we debunk the pathetic debunkers.
[00:18:58.174 --> 00:18:59.595]  It is a big idea.
[00:18:59.615 --> 00:19:01.716]  A New World Order.
[00:19:02.417 --> 00:19:06.679]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:19:07.299 --> 00:19:10.101]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:19:10.141 --> 00:19:12.382]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:19:12.923 --> 00:19:15.384]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:19:16.105 --> 00:19:23.449]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:19:26.451 --> 00:19:31.435]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:19:31.895 --> 00:19:35.378]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:19:35.778 --> 00:19:38.260]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:39.501]  Most people have no idea.
[00:19:39.521 --> 00:19:40.262]  They're not after money.
[00:19:40.302 --> 00:19:41.362]  They have all the money they need.
[00:19:41.563 --> 00:19:42.283]  They're after power.
[00:19:42.543 --> 00:19:43.664]  That's what they're after these years.

[00:19:52.431 --> 00:19:54.873]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:19:55.233 --> 00:19:56.274]  You have been warned.
[00:19:57.401 --> 00:20:03.087]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[00:20:03.348 --> 00:20:08.133]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[00:20:08.153 --> 00:20:12.798]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and
[00:20:12.998 --> 00:20:13.358]  I think so.
[00:20:38.817 --> 00:20:41.158]  Have you heard about American Free Press?
[00:20:41.218 --> 00:20:44.579]  American Free Press, the only national newspaper that endorsed Ron Paul for president.
[00:21:06.192 --> 00:21:07.414]  American Free Press.
[00:21:07.934 --> 00:21:10.317]  Written by patriots, for patriots.
[00:21:10.918 --> 00:21:13.121]  Standing firm for our Constitution.
[00:21:13.701 --> 00:21:16.124]  Standing firm against the New World Order.
[00:21:16.705 --> 00:21:18.387]  Hammering the enemies of freedom.
[00:21:18.968 --> 00:21:21.251]  Exposing the intrigues of the global elite.
[00:21:22.063 --> 00:21:29.607]  American Free Press hits the Bilderbergers and Trilateralists, and the whole Council on Foreign Relations gang, head on!
[00:21:30.088 --> 00:21:33.870]  Here's your chance to catch up with the news from American Free Press.

[00:21:41.034 --> 00:21:42.595]  AmericanFreePress.net
[00:21:43.414 --> 00:21:44.695]  It's just like it sounds.
[00:21:45.116 --> 00:21:48.078]  American Free Press, all one word, dot net.
[00:21:48.559 --> 00:21:51.581]  Once again, that's AmericanFreePress.net.
[00:21:51.902 --> 00:21:56.366]  American Free Press, the voice of the Second American Revolution.
[00:22:04.613 --> 00:22:07.375]  I was shaking my head last night, physically.
[00:22:09.096 --> 00:22:09.736]  Just laughing.
[00:22:09.796 --> 00:22:13.857]  And I kept pausing it and saying, is this really happening?
[00:22:13.937 --> 00:22:15.178]  Is this what they're doing?
[00:22:17.498 --> 00:22:25.080]  Editing what Larry Silverstein had to say, editing what Jennings had to say, cutting everything short, distorting.
[00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:28.001]  That's why they've lost all credibility.
[00:22:28.021 --> 00:22:29.761]  That's why the mainstream media is imploding.
[00:22:30.421 --> 00:22:34.842]  That's why Congress has less than a 10% approval rating for the first time in its history.
[00:22:36.583 --> 00:22:36.983]  It's over.
[00:22:38.496 --> 00:22:43.818]  I mean, this makes the discrediting of the government under Nixon look like child's play.
[00:22:44.779 --> 00:22:46.359]  The people know you're murdering criminals.
[00:22:47.259 --> 00:22:49.040]  The people know you carried out the attacks.
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:58.004]  And your little hitmen, your little hatchetmen, your little media intellectual prostitutes aren't going to get you out of it.
[00:22:58.744 --> 00:22:59.744]  There's nothing you can do.
[00:22:59.764 --> 00:23:02.946]  Burma's continuing with the incredible disinformation
[00:23:04.221 --> 00:23:05.482]  The frenzy that we were witnessing.
[00:23:05.662 --> 00:23:08.543]  Yeah, so we're talking about this supposed new picture.
[00:23:08.923 --> 00:23:11.345]  Now, as they're showing it, and again it's not scanned in.
[00:23:11.365 --> 00:23:15.186]  They won't scan it in, it's a shaky... It's a shaky handycam, the guy's holding it and pointing.
[00:23:15.707 --> 00:23:22.610]  It does not match up with the famous popular mechanics photo that they, they're the only ones that had with this side of the building heavily damaged.
[00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:23.490]  Doesn't match up with it at all.
[00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:28.673]  And let's be clear, that building is grey when 7 was brick red.
[00:23:28.693 --> 00:23:32.335]  I remember when I first saw that in the magazine, I was standing in the grocery store
[00:23:32.995 --> 00:23:36.717]  I heard it was coming out, I went to get one, and I was going, my God, that's a great building!
[00:23:37.077 --> 00:23:39.599]  That's the World Financial Center across the street!
[00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:48.544]  All I can say is that it definitely didn't match up with this photograph, with the supposed maximum damage and scooping out.
[00:23:48.604 --> 00:23:50.485]  Now, let's get to Silverstein for a second.
[00:23:50.525 --> 00:23:55.668]  Now, they go over the Pullet comment, but then they edit out the second half where it says, and we watch the building collapse.
[00:23:55.688 --> 00:23:57.089]  Now, this is what I thought was interesting.
[00:23:57.649 --> 00:24:00.310]  They mentioned that it was to pull the firefighters, right?
[00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:09.153]  And they kind of back him up on that, but then they go to Daniel Nigro, and they ask Daniel Nigro if they would have conferred with Larry Silverstein to pull the firefighting operation.
[00:24:09.173 --> 00:24:09.713]  He's like, no.
[00:24:10.033 --> 00:24:13.855]  He's like, we don't need to take orders from Larry Silverstein to move our firefighters in and out.
[00:24:14.195 --> 00:24:20.117]  So they basically debunk the fact that him saying pull the firefighters was real, but then they didn't make it a point.
[00:24:20.157 --> 00:24:21.137]  They just kind of moved on.
[00:24:21.177 --> 00:24:22.198]  In other words, they didn't stop.
[00:24:22.218 --> 00:24:22.818]  It's a whitewash!
[00:24:22.938 --> 00:24:28.740]  It's kind of like the Australian news is saying it was a plan to kill 200 of our troops.
[00:24:29.001 --> 00:24:31.181]  The US wanted to nerve gas them and we said no.
[00:24:31.782 --> 00:24:33.642]  And they say it might have been illegal to kill them.
[00:24:34.343 --> 00:24:36.183]  But then here in the US and England they did it.
[00:24:36.864 --> 00:24:40.105]  But still it kind of just puts it out there like well there was a plan but we didn't do it.
[00:24:40.385 --> 00:24:43.767]  Meanwhile there's all these reports where they did do it in other nations.
[00:24:43.807 --> 00:24:45.727]  So it's all just kind of a getting it out in the open.
[00:24:46.528 --> 00:24:51.550]  Now the important area to all of this is that
[00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:57.213]  The official reports admit the firefighters were pulled out early in the morning before the other towers fell.
[00:24:57.613 --> 00:25:01.936]  We've got Giuliani admitting that with Peter Jennings and later lying and saying he didn't say it.
[00:25:02.216 --> 00:25:04.638]  Then the tapes were later brought out on NBC News.
[00:25:05.098 --> 00:25:07.239]  So again, in every case they're lying.
[00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:20.128]  Now they're basically coming back in this piece and not getting into the fact that officially the firefighters were pulled before the tower one or two fell, many hours before they claim they pulled them at five o'clock in the afternoon.
[00:25:20.888 --> 00:25:21.429]  Absolutely.
[00:25:21.989 --> 00:25:24.971]  And let me say this, they actually did show the thermal imagery.
[00:25:25.011 --> 00:25:26.572]  Now, they didn't mention molten metal at all.
[00:25:26.613 --> 00:25:31.096]  Now, they say five days later that the thermal imagery proved, Alex... How about five weeks?
[00:25:31.756 --> 00:25:33.598]  Was it five weeks at the... Well, it was week after week.
[00:25:33.618 --> 00:25:39.602]  Well, yeah, no, but I mean the five-day satellite shots, they admitted that that was 747 degrees Celsius.
[00:25:39.643 --> 00:25:47.288]  Now, they say 747 degrees Celsius because the normal person hears that, oh, it was thousands of degrees hot in the World Trade Center, but that's Fahrenheit, folks!
[00:25:47.589 --> 00:25:49.550]  Okay, so they confuse it there and they gloss over that.
[00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:50.691]  They don't talk about molten metal.
[00:25:51.551 --> 00:25:57.773]  Then, they say that the upper floors were engulfed in flames, okay, of World Trade Center Building 7.
[00:25:58.453 --> 00:26:01.154]  But we have the new NIST report saying they were isolated.
[00:26:01.914 --> 00:26:03.675]  I know, again!
[00:26:03.715 --> 00:26:06.236]  See, they don't bring the NIST report in until the last 10 minutes of the film.
[00:26:06.436 --> 00:26:09.497]  The last 20 is a total debunk love fest, by the way.
[00:26:09.537 --> 00:26:10.697]  Yeah, we're cult members.
[00:26:10.997 --> 00:26:11.537]  Oh, God.
[00:26:11.838 --> 00:26:12.718]  It's a religion, Alex.
[00:26:12.738 --> 00:26:14.818]  You know, it's not hardcore scientific fact.
[00:26:14.879 --> 00:26:16.099]  Apparently, we worship something.
[00:26:16.559 --> 00:26:22.782]  Yeah, we don't have all these physicists and engineers and scientists and underwriting laboratory engineers who were fired for not shutting up.
[00:26:23.262 --> 00:26:26.383]  You know, they wanted to be fired for this imaginary religion five years ago.
[00:26:26.603 --> 00:26:26.983]  Absolutely.
[00:26:27.043 --> 00:26:30.165]  I mean, you know, Kevin Ryan, he and the professors, they all wanted to be fired.
[00:26:30.245 --> 00:26:32.085]  Stephen Jones wanted to retire early.
[00:26:32.566 --> 00:26:34.867]  Yeah, because of the religion of 9-11.
[00:26:35.267 --> 00:26:36.267]  No, it's their religion!
[00:26:36.287 --> 00:26:36.907]  We'll be right back.
[00:26:39.969 --> 00:26:41.589]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:44.831]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:26:44.851 --> 00:26:45.711]  Okay, you got it.
[00:26:47.851 --> 00:26:49.893]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:26:49.994 --> 00:26:52.416]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:26:52.436 --> 00:26:55.039]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:26:55.059 --> 00:26:56.220]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:57.882]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:26:57.962 --> 00:27:00.805]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:27:00.865 --> 00:27:04.489]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:27:14.148 --> 00:27:19.000]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:27:27.023 --> 00:27:30.304]  You know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:27:30.324 --> 00:27:33.106]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:27:33.206 --> 00:27:39.629]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[00:27:39.689 --> 00:27:42.250]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:44.531]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:27:44.771 --> 00:27:47.252]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:27:50.339 --> 00:27:52.241]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:27:52.741 --> 00:27:55.484]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:28:02.176 --> 00:28:06.277]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:28:06.997 --> 00:28:07.817]  You want answers?
[00:28:08.577 --> 00:28:09.477]  Well, so does he.
[00:28:09.497 --> 00:28:13.778]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:28:14.338 --> 00:28:18.439]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:28:19.019 --> 00:28:20.980]  Jason, you got four minutes and thirty seconds.
[00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:26.541]  Start back at the first, run through all the basic points that we detailed, and get into the new ones as quickly as possible.
[00:28:27.421 --> 00:28:36.223]  Alright, they edited Barry Jennings statements to seem like he was there after the second plane strike after the building had officially been evacuated and that he was alone and not with Michael Hess.
[00:28:36.443 --> 00:28:44.844]  They also tried to say that he did not step over bodies, even though they did play the clip of Dylan playing the clip saying he did step over bodies in that building.
[00:28:45.264 --> 00:28:50.865]  On top of that, they showed this photograph very shakily saying that it proved that the building was heavily damaged.
[00:28:50.885 --> 00:28:55.246]  It did not match up in any way, shape, or form with the supposed popular mechanics photograph.
[00:28:55.686 --> 00:29:03.671]  Okay, on top of all of that, they had to also admit that Routers is the one that put out that press release that Building 7 came down.
[00:29:03.791 --> 00:29:04.932]  The official version, by the way.
[00:29:05.012 --> 00:29:07.993]  And we asked them for months, and they said we were harassing them.
[00:29:08.313 --> 00:29:14.857]  Tell us what news wire you got it off of, because we could tell CNN and BBC both reported the same thing.
[00:29:15.198 --> 00:29:19.300]  Somebody false scripted and gave them that, and that's who we have to go after.
[00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:27.403]  Absolutely, and they gloss over that fact, too, just like they gloss over the fact that Daniel Nigro admits that Silverstein would have had no input whatsoever in pulling the firefighter.
[00:29:27.423 --> 00:29:31.445]  And they also edit down what she had to say that was incredibly suspicious.
[00:29:31.505 --> 00:29:33.405]  Yeah, well, of course, we're all conspiracy theorists.
[00:29:33.465 --> 00:29:34.226]  It's ruined her life.
[00:29:34.286 --> 00:29:35.426]  God forbid we ask questions.
[00:29:35.446 --> 00:29:36.607]  Yeah, they personalize it.
[00:29:36.707 --> 00:29:38.107]  We're victimizing people.
[00:29:38.187 --> 00:29:47.131]  Now, with some of the new stuff, when they actually got into the NIST report, for instance, yeah, NIST admitted that they had no steel from 7 to work with, and it was all a computer model.
[00:29:47.691 --> 00:29:53.894]  All right, so how are they able to even hypothesize that this was all due to regular office fires, which is what they're putting out.
[00:29:53.934 --> 00:29:55.234]  That was the last ten minutes of the thing.
[00:29:55.534 --> 00:29:56.455]  Of course it's going to be that.
[00:29:56.475 --> 00:29:57.135]  They went and saw.
[00:29:57.275 --> 00:30:01.517]  But underwriting laboratories did real steel models of Tower 1 and 2 and found fires couldn't do it.
[00:30:01.577 --> 00:30:02.317]  No, absolutely not.
[00:30:02.577 --> 00:30:06.118]  They subjected them to longer and hotter fires and the building models only sagged.
[00:30:06.138 --> 00:30:06.599]  And these were massive.
[00:30:06.619 --> 00:30:09.920]  Oh, but that's part of our false religion, reading the underwriting laboratories report.
[00:30:10.481 --> 00:30:11.061]  Absolutely.
[00:30:11.201 --> 00:30:15.166]  Again, they end it with the religion angle, and they have one firefighter.
[00:30:15.447 --> 00:30:16.047]  One firefighter.
[00:30:16.087 --> 00:30:19.371]  Let's remember, Alex, we've talked to many firefighters.
[00:30:19.391 --> 00:30:21.894]  There are a lot of them in our film, from John Schroeder to Craig.
[00:30:21.974 --> 00:30:23.977]  The firefighters honk and wave at us, most of them.
[00:30:23.997 --> 00:30:25.098]  Yeah, I know.
[00:30:25.258 --> 00:30:26.039]  It's unbelievable to me.
[00:30:26.059 --> 00:30:29.804]  And this guy says that we're disrespecting them, and he has no idea what's going on.
[00:30:29.804 --> 00:30:31.385]  So it's more guilt by association.
[00:30:31.705 --> 00:30:36.087]  Meanwhile, we have Bill Doyle, head of the biggest family, saying the majority believe inside job.
[00:30:36.427 --> 00:30:37.888]  I've interviewed countless families.
[00:30:38.328 --> 00:30:40.369]  All of them, we talked to, believe inside job.
[00:30:40.409 --> 00:30:42.209]  But they always say, all the families hate us.
[00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:43.570]  They all disagree with us.
[00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:44.791]  We hurt the families.
[00:30:44.871 --> 00:30:45.271]  Absolutely.
[00:30:45.311 --> 00:30:46.571]  Now, I want to say this.
[00:30:46.891 --> 00:30:50.473]  They did show a lot of Stephen Jones, and Stephen Jones' research is amazing, folks.
[00:30:50.793 --> 00:30:53.755]  He is the guy to go to for controlled demolition.
[00:30:53.775 --> 00:30:54.335]  I'll say it again.
[00:30:54.375 --> 00:30:56.216]  He's the guy to go to for controlled demolition.
[00:30:56.236 --> 00:30:57.176]  He does the real scientific
[00:30:57.216 --> 00:31:01.979]  Oh, but the head guys at NIST trying to debunk us, they happen to be the world experts in explosive thermite.
[00:31:02.319 --> 00:31:05.101]  Oh, there's only a few dozen, and they're the top experts.
[00:31:06.022 --> 00:31:06.862]  Oh, mmm.
[00:31:06.943 --> 00:31:08.664]  Yeah, and Lizzo, of course.
[00:31:08.744 --> 00:31:11.065]  Actually, he says an interesting line.
[00:31:11.105 --> 00:31:14.407]  The guy says, well, you make all the calling cards for someone who could have done this.
[00:31:14.428 --> 00:31:17.009]  He's like, yes, I would have been a great terrorist.
[00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:18.390]  Unfortunately, I'm not.
[00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:19.951]  Unfortunately, you're not?
[00:31:20.031 --> 00:31:23.153]  Why would it be unfortunate that you're not a terrorist, Mr. Lizzo?
[00:31:23.494 --> 00:31:26.976]  And again, it's Controlled Demolition Incorporated that
[00:31:27.396 --> 00:31:32.139]  Did cover up Oklahoma City, did cover up 9-11, but I mean, they're good people.
[00:31:32.179 --> 00:31:33.681]  Yeah, it's an absolute cover-up.
[00:31:33.701 --> 00:31:39.324]  They had Gene Corley on there too, another OKC cover-up artist and World Trade Center cover-up artist.
[00:31:39.645 --> 00:31:44.668]  And every point that Stephen Jones would make, they would debunk in about 20 seconds and not follow it up.
[00:31:44.688 --> 00:31:45.409]  Real simply.
[00:31:45.469 --> 00:31:48.271]  It's kind of like the popular mechanics would cover some physicist
[00:31:48.931 --> 00:31:49.992]  But wouldn't call them an expert.
[00:31:50.012 --> 00:31:54.054]  Would cut to some 22-year-old kid in a glistening office going, we debunked it.
[00:31:54.074 --> 00:31:54.835]  We're scientists.
[00:31:54.875 --> 00:31:57.337]  And they'd go, expert analysis.
[00:31:57.597 --> 00:32:01.739]  And then they would cut from some engineer back to the kid going, it's preposterous.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.862]  Yeah, meanwhile, he used to write sports for his local paper in Pennsylvania.
[00:32:05.922 --> 00:32:08.924]  And their editor is the ex-editor of Entertainment Weekly.
[00:32:08.984 --> 00:32:09.765]  Think about it, folks.
[00:32:10.005 --> 00:32:10.745]  Entertainment Weekly.
[00:32:10.785 --> 00:32:12.046]  He's not an engineer.
[00:32:12.386 --> 00:32:13.507]  He is an entertainer.
[00:32:14.067 --> 00:32:17.689]  We've got reports up on PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com.
[00:32:17.809 --> 00:32:21.071]  I want you, because there's even more points there, to get this stuff to Paul.
[00:32:21.131 --> 00:32:22.091]  Points you think ought to be made.
[00:32:22.411 --> 00:32:24.412]  He's watching it again, doing a whole other piece.
[00:32:24.773 --> 00:32:28.414]  I mean, just the part of them editing down Larry Silverstein is devastating.
[00:32:28.895 --> 00:32:32.516]  I mean, just the part of them editing her down, editing him down.
[00:32:33.897 --> 00:32:39.560]  We're going to put it all up on the web, showing how they edited it to people, and now they've... Talk about digging a hole deeper.
[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:44.363]  I mean, they have literally, literally caught themselves on fire now.
[00:32:44.403 --> 00:32:47.744]  I mean, it's gone from suspicious to really bad, Burmus.
[00:32:48.004 --> 00:32:48.485]  Absolutely.
[00:32:48.525 --> 00:32:53.427]  And to all you people out there that are YouTube junkies and listeners and put together these short videos, now's the time.
[00:32:53.507 --> 00:32:53.868]  Get on it.
[00:32:53.888 --> 00:32:54.628]  We need these things.
[00:32:54.668 --> 00:32:55.989]  Send them over to Aaron at Infowars.com.
[00:32:56.009 --> 00:32:56.549]  Help us out.
[00:32:56.589 --> 00:32:56.929]  Stay there.
[00:32:56.949 --> 00:32:57.309]  Stay there.
[00:32:57.329 --> 00:32:58.670]  We're going to talk behind the scenes.
[00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:00.191]  Let me talk to you behind the scenes.
[00:33:00.411 --> 00:33:01.712]  Hey John, you got Baldwin ready?
[00:33:02.512 --> 00:33:03.193]  They got me on hold.
[00:33:03.413 --> 00:33:03.853]  Okay, that's fine.
[00:33:03.894 --> 00:33:05.936]  I'm going to keep talking to Burmester in this behind the scenes.
[00:33:06.376 --> 00:33:08.218]  Go ahead and finish up any other points you want to make, Burmester.
[00:33:08.258 --> 00:33:11.121]  Yeah, I just want to say there are so many points throughout this.
[00:33:11.181 --> 00:33:14.945]  I mean, again, they try to discredit the thermite hypothesis.
[00:33:14.965 --> 00:33:21.432]  They gloss over the fact that the steel beams evaporated with this one expert that says, oh, this is exactly what I would think.
[00:33:21.732 --> 00:33:22.872]  Attention to the no-plainers.
[00:33:23.172 --> 00:33:36.275]  Yes, they end it with the emotional, the firefighters and family members hate us, they go down to Ground Zero, they briefly talk to Luke and another member of We Are Change, but then they zoom right in on that TV fakery logo.
[00:33:36.295 --> 00:33:40.216]  They want to throw in every crazy, preposterous theory to try to make us look bad.
[00:33:40.236 --> 00:33:50.838]  Which, a couple years ago, they could at least act semi-credible with saying no planes at the towers, but now it's meant with signs saying we did the bombing, and biting noses, and just running around frothing
[00:33:51.218 --> 00:33:52.519]  Wildly, blah!
[00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:54.401]  You know, always with the news media.
[00:33:54.421 --> 00:33:56.303]  I mean, how obvious does it have to get?
[00:33:56.343 --> 00:33:58.085]  This is classic COINTELPRO.
[00:33:58.386 --> 00:34:01.629]  And it's actually kind of scary, I mean, to have real COINTELPRO on you.
[00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:04.352]  And Secret Service running around in the office today.
[00:34:04.372 --> 00:34:05.253]  You literally have Secret Service.
[00:34:05.273 --> 00:34:07.255]  You have threats at home, and I mean, you know, it's...
[00:34:07.515 --> 00:34:14.200]  If people knew half of what went on here, Alex, honestly, I mean, I've only been here a couple months, folks, and this is the real deal.
[00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:19.505]  We're a small office, we reach a lot of people, and the government's interested in what we do, Alex.
[00:34:19.865 --> 00:34:20.145]  Period.
[00:34:20.165 --> 00:34:20.465]  Amen.
[00:34:20.806 --> 00:34:22.647]  The Secret Service would not be here otherwise.
[00:34:22.667 --> 00:34:25.269]  Cars driving around, photographing people everywhere.
[00:34:25.509 --> 00:34:32.695]  I've seen some pretty brash comments on other forums that aren't as big as yours or your website, or sometimes they are as big as yours, and guess what?
[00:34:32.755 --> 00:34:33.976]  Secret Service ain't going there.
[00:34:34.256 --> 00:34:34.777]  They're coming here.
[00:34:38.123 --> 00:34:40.046]  Yeah, I mean, I just need support from people, folks.
[00:34:40.066 --> 00:34:41.327]  You need to get Truth Rising.
[00:34:41.387 --> 00:34:42.309]  They're scared of it.
[00:34:42.669 --> 00:34:48.777]  Get it out to everybody, folks, or your little buddies are going to continue to stage terror attacks and take all your liberties and freedoms.
[00:34:49.157 --> 00:34:52.402]  But listen, watching this BBC piece, because I finally watched the whole thing last night.
[00:34:52.682 --> 00:34:53.583]  I watched pieces of it.
[00:34:54.364 --> 00:34:56.585]  It just blew me away.
[00:34:56.685 --> 00:34:57.785]  This is the best they can do.
[00:34:58.045 --> 00:35:07.369]  Yeah, well again, they also end it with the expert Richard Clarke just saying he has no authority whatsoever, he's just the counter-terrorism guy for Bush, and he's the one that glossed over the war games.
[00:35:07.649 --> 00:35:14.131]  I remember there was like a 2003 interview with him, again, and someone called him out and said, well what about the war games on 9-11?
[00:35:14.151 --> 00:35:18.473]  Oh, that sounds like you're talking conspiracy theories to me, and he just hung up on them.
[00:35:19.053 --> 00:35:19.353]  Okay.
[00:35:19.893 --> 00:35:24.055]  Now it came out later, I mean in USA Today, on ABC News.
[00:35:24.115 --> 00:35:27.856]  Of course they were running drills on 9-11 that were hijacking drills.
[00:35:27.876 --> 00:35:32.798]  And they just so happened to be running drills of the exact bus, exact trains being bombed at the exact same time.
[00:35:32.818 --> 00:35:35.278]  And we had an actuary done.
[00:35:35.298 --> 00:35:37.179]  It was one out of 43 Tretter Gilliam.
[00:35:37.419 --> 00:35:39.920]  And that's more than all the grains of sand billions of times.
[00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:49.525]  The guy who admits to it, because he's not in on the plot, Peter Power, a visor consultant, he admits to it twice, once on Sky News and once on the BBC, he gets confronted this year by We Are Changing.
[00:35:49.545 --> 00:35:50.106]  Hides in a closet.
[00:35:50.146 --> 00:35:54.328]  Hides in a closet because he goes, uh-oh, not supposed to do that.
[00:35:54.468 --> 00:35:59.511]  We Are Changing, when he confronts the former head of MI6 about it, and then their house gets broken into and everything's stolen.
[00:36:00.592 --> 00:36:02.012]  I mean, folks, this is getting hardcore.
[00:36:02.032 --> 00:36:02.753]  Thank you, Jason Bermas.
[00:36:02.773 --> 00:36:03.133]  You got it.
[00:36:03.353 --> 00:36:05.254]  Going back live now, do we have our guest, John?
[00:36:05.294 --> 00:36:05.835]  We sure do.
[00:36:06.315 --> 00:36:07.796]  Let's do it, let's go, go, go.
[00:36:08.763 --> 00:36:09.624]  Well, so does he.
[00:36:10.305 --> 00:36:14.049]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:36:14.509 --> 00:36:18.554]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:36:20.323 --> 00:36:26.426]  Well, in the next 30 minutes or so, we're really honored to be joined by Chuck Baldwin.
[00:36:26.446 --> 00:36:29.928]  Chuck Baldwin, of course, is a radio talk show host, author.
[00:36:30.989 --> 00:36:48.498]  He has tirelessly republished and gotten out the founding documents of liberty to tens of thousands of people, the Bill of Rights, Constitution, Declaration of Independence, and he's gotten the Constitution Party nomination, got it from the former UN ambassador, and
[00:36:49.218 --> 00:36:53.562]  Really, he's a fake conservative, another one of these neocons, better than Bush, but that's not saying much.
[00:36:55.103 --> 00:37:00.968]  Mr. Key, and I'm sad that, you know, Alan Yokees is like that.
[00:37:01.869 --> 00:37:03.330]  I would like to think better of him.
[00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:04.231]  I'm not bashing him.
[00:37:04.671 --> 00:37:13.839]  I'm just glad that a true anti-New World Order individual won this and can really go out to debates and events now and spread the message of liberty.
[00:37:14.139 --> 00:37:20.843]  And I wanted to talk to him just about his experiences so you can know who Chuck Baldwin the man is and how you can get involved in the campaign.
[00:37:20.863 --> 00:37:30.288]  And also open the phones up if you'd like to ask any questions of him, but specifically for Chuck Baldwin and this election and the Constitution Party platform.
[00:37:30.908 --> 00:37:33.330]  And Howard Phillips behind him and other great people.
[00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:33.410]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:37:38.649 --> 00:37:42.872]  And we'll keep him until 40 after if he can do it so we can take more calls.
[00:37:42.892 --> 00:37:43.813]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:37:45.114 --> 00:37:47.416]  Chuck Baldwin, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[00:37:48.216 --> 00:37:49.737]  Alex, it's great to be with you again.
[00:37:49.777 --> 00:37:50.178]  Thank you.
[00:37:50.738 --> 00:38:04.248]  Out of the gates, I remember you years ago when this thing came out about preachers being approached by FEMA to teach their flocks to submit to government, hand their guns in, that you had said you had been similarly approached, but that was in my foggy memory.
[00:38:05.209 --> 00:38:10.273]  Get updated, because as you know now, Mainstream News has admitted they've recruited 26,000 preachers.
[00:38:10.653 --> 00:38:11.994]  It is for gun confiscation.
[00:38:12.014 --> 00:38:13.555]  They're out giving sermons.
[00:38:13.595 --> 00:38:23.702]  We now have them on video, on national TV, and locally, saying the same talking points about, let them take your children, take the inoculations, being a slave of government.
[00:38:23.983 --> 00:38:25.063]  It's what Jesus wants.
[00:38:25.584 --> 00:38:32.629]  You know, as a pastor, who's pastored a pretty good-sized church in Florida, I wanted you to break down your experiences with similar things.
[00:38:33.925 --> 00:38:39.288]  Okay, Alex, yeah, we're going back to the days after Hurricane Katrina.
[00:38:39.688 --> 00:38:41.369]  They didn't approach me directly.
[00:38:41.489 --> 00:38:56.657]  I remember picking up that story out of Louisiana, and the reporter there chronicled how they were going to pastors in the area and asking them to facilitate the gun confiscation at the request of the federal government.
[00:38:57.397 --> 00:39:00.779]  And when I heard of that, I wrote a column about it.
[00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:10.205]  And after my column went out nationwide, I had a pastor call me from the state of Ohio, and he was approached.
[00:39:10.285 --> 00:39:18.190]  In fact, he went in on some of the training classes that were given, and he was giving me his information and his experience.
[00:39:18.971 --> 00:39:27.356]  And after that, I got up in my congregation, and I told them that not only would I not participate in requesting them to
[00:39:28.143 --> 00:39:31.795]  Give up their firearms because I was encouraging all of them to go out and buy a gun.
[00:39:33.007 --> 00:39:35.468]  That was the issue, and then that got some press.
[00:39:36.028 --> 00:39:36.249]  Right.
[00:39:36.329 --> 00:39:49.515]  I mean, this is right out of the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany to have these state-approved churches, and when we got the secret documents two-plus years ago, and then it was a year and a half later that it was then confirmed, that really scared people.
[00:39:49.575 --> 00:39:57.799]  I mean, they thought I was producing fake documents from preachers, even though the two pastors that gave us that material got Homeland Security visits.
[00:39:58.499 --> 00:40:08.084]  Even though we covered up the phone numbers and where it came from, they were surveilling things so seriously that they were able to track who had done it, and it basically went and threatened them.
[00:40:08.425 --> 00:40:14.308]  How dare a preacher tell the public that they've been secretly approached to brainwash their congregation?
[00:40:14.648 --> 00:40:18.050]  I mean, this is hardcore tyranny on steroids, Pastor.
[00:40:19.454 --> 00:40:29.116]  Well, yeah, it is, and it's the beginning of what George Herbert Walker Bush called, and you talk about a lot on your show, the New World Order, and we're seeing it come to fruition.
[00:40:29.136 --> 00:40:43.520]  And I gotta tell you, Alex, and I think your listeners are already aware of this, that if these two major parties continue their dominance of American politics, the America that we've known, a free, independent, sovereign America, is not going to be long for this Earth.
[00:40:44.219 --> 00:40:52.621]  And it doesn't matter whether you elect John McCain or Barack Obama, they're both going to facilitate this New World Order, the NAFTA superhighway, the North American Union, and all of that.
[00:40:53.401 --> 00:40:57.382]  There's virtually no difference between the two major party candidates.
[00:40:57.902 --> 00:41:09.484]  And that's why at the request of Howard Phillips and several others in the Constitution Party, they asked me if I would consider putting my name in nomination.
[00:41:10.271 --> 00:41:12.494]  And I was very reluctant to do it, to be honest with you.
[00:41:12.514 --> 00:41:15.237]  I mean, it's not like I have nothing to do, Alex.
[00:41:15.858 --> 00:41:20.364]  I'm very busy, and I had to really pray and deliberate about that.
[00:41:20.404 --> 00:41:24.068]  But finally, God gave me the green light, and so we put our name in the nomination.
[00:41:24.089 --> 00:41:27.032]  And as you said, the delegates voted for me 74%, 24% over Dr. Alan Keyes.
[00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:34.453]  So I've been on the campaign trail now for the last several weeks, and I gotta tell you, I just came back from the West Coast.
[00:41:34.513 --> 00:41:39.657]  I was in Los Angeles and San Diego, then I went to Utah and toured the entire state of Utah.
[00:41:40.098 --> 00:41:41.258]  We were going day and night.
[00:41:41.679 --> 00:41:43.980]  The local press was very favorable to us.
[00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:47.143]  The radio, television, print media was very favorable.
[00:41:47.163 --> 00:41:48.063]  We had great crowds.
[00:41:48.103 --> 00:41:49.104]  They were enthusiastic.
[00:41:49.664 --> 00:41:51.606]  We made a lot of great friends and supporters.
[00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:59.377]  And I've got to tell you, it was really great being out there on the West Coast and seeing the responses from people that are looking for the truth.
[00:41:59.417 --> 00:42:04.782]  They're looking for people that will stand up without compromise and call a spade a spade.
[00:42:04.822 --> 00:42:15.052]  And I've got to tell you, I think as we continue this campaign through these next couple of months, I believe the American people are really going to start awakening to what's happening.
[00:42:15.072 --> 00:42:16.433]  I'm very encouraged at this point.
[00:42:17.827 --> 00:42:23.008]  Well, everybody I talk to, and what I personally experience, Mr. Baldwin, is the same thing.
[00:42:24.008 --> 00:42:39.232]  And now, out today, another scientific poll, the Drudge Report's got a link to it, it's also up on InfoWars.com, where Congress has the lowest approval rating in its history, and previously they never went below a 30.
[00:42:39.812 --> 00:42:42.373]  And they just keep breaking record after record after record.
[00:42:42.773 --> 00:42:47.174]  That shows that both parties are fully discredited, and they can't
[00:42:48.032 --> 00:42:48.572]  We're good to go.
[00:43:07.439 --> 00:43:12.461]  On average, you know, an understanding of just how deep the rabbit hole goes, but this is a huge victory!
[00:43:12.501 --> 00:43:21.004]  We have discredited these scoundrels, because on every major issue, they go against the Constitution, that also happens to be the will of the people.
[00:43:21.444 --> 00:43:24.426]  You know, funny how the will of the people happens to be aligned with the Constitution.
[00:43:24.946 --> 00:43:25.806]  Yeah, usually it is.
[00:43:26.246 --> 00:43:30.608]  You know, another thing is very, I think, symbolic of what you were just mentioning there.
[00:43:30.928 --> 00:43:32.629]  When I was out in California, Utah,
[00:43:34.202 --> 00:43:53.987]  I heard that there was a long time congressman out there that was a part of the establishment and he was for open borders and illegal immigration and the whole nine yards and everybody thought he was untouchable and that was Chris Cannon and lo and behold he got beat by a 60 to 40 percent margin in the primaries.
[00:43:54.027 --> 00:43:55.608]  He never made it to the general election.
[00:43:56.208 --> 00:43:59.069]  And this was a guy that they figured would never be beaten in Utah.
[00:43:59.609 --> 00:44:03.410]  I got a feeling that this coming November there's going to be a real shakeup.
[00:44:03.985 --> 00:44:05.006]  In Washington, D.C.
[00:44:05.166 --> 00:44:14.693]  And if no other issue, I think, has galvanized the people as to the problem that these two major parties are presenting to us today, it's this illegal immigration problem.
[00:44:15.174 --> 00:44:16.034]  I was on the border.
[00:44:16.495 --> 00:44:17.396]  Alex, it was very interesting.
[00:44:17.456 --> 00:44:19.037]  I got a grand tour.
[00:44:19.057 --> 00:44:25.622]  I got the VIP tour of the main port of entry there, south of San Diego, on the border.
[00:44:26.041 --> 00:44:34.525]  And then I went out into the real border, into the desert, and I saw the real situation that's going on out there, and I got a chance to talk to Border Patrol people and volunteers and so forth on the border.
[00:44:35.126 --> 00:44:37.167]  And it's worse than we realized.
[00:44:37.227 --> 00:44:43.050]  I mean, I thought I knew how bad it was, but when I got there and saw the reality of it, it was ten times worse.
[00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:46.632]  It is totally lawless with Mexican troops kidnapping, killing U.S.
[00:44:46.672 --> 00:44:50.834]  citizens, police, military, robbing sheriff's deputies at gunpoint.
[00:44:52.094 --> 00:44:55.036]  In one night, 18 homes burned to the ground.
[00:44:55.476 --> 00:44:57.657]  Rocket attacks, truck bombs in Dallas.
[00:44:58.518 --> 00:45:03.060]  Major city police departments told to not arrest illegals even when they're committing DWIs.
[00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:05.862]  I mean, it is just lawlessness.
[00:45:06.342 --> 00:45:07.883]  Just total lawlessness.
[00:45:08.343 --> 00:45:09.303]  Yeah, it really is.
[00:45:10.044 --> 00:45:14.706]  And when I was there, I met a real sweet black couple, a man and wife.
[00:45:14.766 --> 00:45:16.227]  They had a real great family.
[00:45:16.387 --> 00:45:19.749]  A boy that's 17 years old, he was an honor student in school.
[00:45:20.347 --> 00:45:27.350]  He was preparing for college, he was a star athlete, he made the honor roll, he was Dean's List, all of that.
[00:45:27.370 --> 00:45:35.553]  He's standing out front of his home, in his front yard, and an illegal Mexican gangbanger came up and shot him in the gut.
[00:45:36.174 --> 00:45:41.896]  And as the young man is writhing in pain on the ground, this fellow takes his gun and
[00:45:42.659 --> 00:45:42.979]  That's right.
[00:45:57.162 --> 00:46:02.384]  of jail on parole for assaulting a police officer when he killed this young man.
[00:46:02.404 --> 00:46:03.905]  Now this is an illegal alien.
[00:46:04.465 --> 00:46:06.465]  That's just one example of what's going on.
[00:46:06.485 --> 00:46:15.629]  And for those that don't know, Chuck, sorry to interrupt you, there is a bounty on what the illegal aliens call Mayottas, and I didn't know this until a few years ago.
[00:46:16.689 --> 00:46:21.471]  With at least a strain of the Mexican culture, blacks are completely reviled.
[00:46:21.812 --> 00:46:35.658]  Now the mainstream media has had to admit that that's why a lot of people aren't going to vote who happen to be just recent American citizens, because they're going to vote for McCain instead, even though they're Democrats, because they hate, quote, blackbirds.
[00:46:35.938 --> 00:46:39.620]  I hate to use that term, but we've got a serious race relations problem here.
[00:46:40.276 --> 00:46:46.260]  Other question, Los Angeles, California is a real war zone with these gangs coming across the border.
[00:46:46.661 --> 00:46:57.449]  And when you look at the two major party candidates, really, you look at Barack Obama, you look at John McCain, you look at McAmnesty McCain, there's no difference in these fellas when it comes to securing our borders.
[00:46:57.529 --> 00:47:00.751]  Neither one of these fellas have any intention on securing our borders.
[00:47:01.192 --> 00:47:06.996]  If the American people want to elect someone in November who really has the will and the determination
[00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:10.342]  To seal our borders and to protect our borders.
[00:47:10.842 --> 00:47:13.464]  There's only one candidate in 2008 and that's Chuck Baldwin.
[00:47:14.645 --> 00:47:15.525]  You're absolutely right.
[00:47:15.625 --> 00:47:18.647]  Their fix for the border is to just legalize everyone.
[00:47:18.667 --> 00:47:22.330]  That's kind of like the way to fix murder is just say murder isn't murder.
[00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:23.311]  That's right.
[00:47:23.591 --> 00:47:25.792]  And I think you know what's going on here.
[00:47:25.832 --> 00:47:27.994]  This is just part of a bigger picture.
[00:47:28.194 --> 00:47:31.576]  What they want to do is they want to facilitate this North American Union.
[00:47:31.976 --> 00:47:32.877]  That's what they're doing.
[00:47:33.057 --> 00:47:35.579]  And in order to do that they have to keep these borders open.
[00:47:36.806 --> 00:47:45.214]  Chuck Baldwin, what I'm doing with some of the segments now is I'm also simulcasting this on my internet site via TV program and the web streams at InfoWars.com.
[00:47:45.534 --> 00:47:52.480]  I don't want to waste any time with you, so we're going to talk a little bit here on the internet, kind of behind the scenes, then come back in a few minutes for everybody else.
[00:47:52.881 --> 00:47:54.022]  So please stay with us.
[00:47:54.102 --> 00:47:55.323]  We're going right back to Chuck Baldwin.
[00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:01.251]  Okay, yeah, go ahead and bring me back to Mr. Baldwin.
[00:48:01.571 --> 00:48:08.273]  Chuck, before you leave us, we're going to get out all the websites, how volunteers get involved, and I want to talk about a whole host of other issues.
[00:48:09.473 --> 00:48:14.315]  But first off, I forgot to ask my producer, do you want to stay with us until about 45 after so we can take calls?
[00:48:14.875 --> 00:48:15.675]  Yeah, I can do that.
[00:48:15.995 --> 00:48:16.755]  Okay, fantastic.
[00:48:16.795 --> 00:48:18.596]  I mean, if you can't, we can let you go at the bottom of the hour.
[00:48:18.836 --> 00:48:23.357]  Yeah, no, 45, I told them to clear my calendar for you, so I'm good to a quarter till.
[00:48:23.477 --> 00:48:24.517]  Okay, fantastic.
[00:48:25.417 --> 00:48:32.679]  I do want to take some calls, and so we're going to be back here in about two minutes, and we'll go straight back to you.
[00:48:32.979 --> 00:48:36.140]  What are some of the other issues you want to discuss when we get back on the main broadcast?
[00:48:36.482 --> 00:48:39.063]  I want to talk about NAFTA and these free trade deals.
[00:48:39.123 --> 00:48:40.644]  John McCain was down there in Columbia again.
[00:48:40.704 --> 00:48:46.366]  I just got back from Michigan as well, and I saw the devastation of the economy up there in that state because of NAFTA.
[00:48:47.467 --> 00:48:48.747]  Definitely want to talk about that.
[00:48:48.947 --> 00:48:49.908]  Okay, fantastic.
[00:48:49.928 --> 00:48:53.449]  And then how folks can join you, and then we'll take some phone calls.
[00:48:53.469 --> 00:48:59.172]  We're going to give this out on the full radio show, but right now, for the internet viewers, go ahead and give out all your contact info.
[00:48:59.692 --> 00:48:59.972]  Great.

[00:50:00.171 --> 00:50:02.073]  Take action against their global masters.
[00:50:02.373 --> 00:50:05.436]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:50:05.536 --> 00:50:10.720]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

[00:50:28.355 --> 00:50:36.360]  Have you ever suffered from giardia, food poisoning, heavy metal poisoning, arthritis, fatigue, or high cholesterol?
[00:50:36.581 --> 00:50:42.745]  Maybe you're one of the 75 million Americans that the Center for Disease Control reports as suffering from internal parasites.

[00:51:29.446 --> 00:51:33.088]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:51:33.508 --> 00:51:38.931]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:51:39.391 --> 00:51:40.472]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:51:40.512 --> 00:51:44.574]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:51:45.214 --> 00:51:58.341]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:52:08.106 --> 00:52:12.890]  We might still have time, ladies and gentlemen, to turn this country around, but it's looking bad.
[00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:16.533]  The New World Order's doing everything to us they said they'd do, and more.
[00:52:16.553 --> 00:52:24.479]  Chuck Baldwin, really great guy, great writer, great researcher, wonderful pastor.
[00:52:30.558 --> 00:52:31.099]  We're good to go.
[00:52:52.931 --> 00:52:54.752]  Paul Craig Roberts again in the next hour.
[00:52:54.772 --> 00:52:56.712]  It's going to be very interesting information.
[00:52:56.732 --> 00:53:01.393]  But right now, Chuck Baldwin, Constitution Party presidential candidate.
[00:53:01.413 --> 00:53:08.015]  You've been traveling the country, and also you've been watching McCain for the first time, a presidential candidate.
[00:53:08.375 --> 00:53:16.477]  He's campaigning in Mexico, Colombia, Germany, taking illegal campaign contributions in England, admitting it's a felony and just saying, I don't care.
[00:53:16.497 --> 00:53:19.058]  I mean, just despicable.
[00:53:20.439 --> 00:53:21.859]  What's your take on NAFTA and GATT?
[00:53:23.134 --> 00:53:28.638]  Well, I worked in Detroit, Michigan when I was a student in college from 1971 to 1973.
[00:53:28.778 --> 00:53:32.040]  I worked at General Motors Truck and Coach Plant 5.
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:36.844]  I was on the assembly line, UAW member, and all of that.
[00:53:38.025 --> 00:53:46.731]  When I was there, there were three shifts a day, 24-7, putting out those big Astro GMC cabs, and the economy was vibrant and great.
[00:53:47.752 --> 00:53:49.533]  Unemployment was almost non-existent.
[00:53:50.126 --> 00:53:52.167]  I come back 35 years later.
[00:53:52.187 --> 00:53:58.128]  I was just up there a couple weeks ago, and the plant that I used to work at, Alex, no longer exists.
[00:53:58.248 --> 00:53:59.168]  They've torn it down.
[00:53:59.769 --> 00:54:05.130]  I've looked at the neighborhoods there where I used to traverse going back and forth to work, and those factories are all gone.
[00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:09.171]  The ones that aren't torn down are abandoned, dilapidated, empty.
[00:54:09.531 --> 00:54:10.411]  The jobs are gone.
[00:54:10.451 --> 00:54:12.672]  Of course, they're in China and India and Mexico.
[00:54:13.786 --> 00:54:20.110]  Workers are scrambling to try to find two and three jobs to make up for the good job that they lost.
[00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:26.413]  Boy, NAFTA and GATT was great, just like both parties told us it would be, and now things are going to get even worse.
[00:54:26.693 --> 00:54:29.475]  They're saying the remaining Ford plants are going to Mexico.
[00:54:29.495 --> 00:54:30.115]  Yep.
[00:54:30.575 --> 00:54:34.678]  And you're right, it is because of these so-called free trade deals.
[00:54:34.698 --> 00:54:40.861]  First it was NAFTA, then GATT and the WTO, and now it's CAFTA and the FTAA is just around the corner.
[00:54:41.451 --> 00:54:45.695]  As you know, John McCain is down there in Columbia negotiating a free trade deal with Columbia.
[00:54:45.735 --> 00:54:46.756]  He's not even President yet.
[00:54:48.177 --> 00:54:50.499]  These things have devastated our economy.
[00:54:50.539 --> 00:54:52.160]  They've devastated our workforce.
[00:54:52.641 --> 00:54:54.703]  Our manufacturing plants are gone.
[00:54:54.763 --> 00:54:57.145]  Can't hardly find anything made in America anymore.
[00:54:57.725 --> 00:55:04.291]  And I know I've been on radio and television the last several weeks, and I keep telling everybody, they ask me about this, and I say, you know, look, this is not hard.
[00:55:04.758 --> 00:55:05.979]  It's not rocket science, you know.
[00:55:06.519 --> 00:55:09.760]  John McCain, he's all for NAFTA and GATT, he's all for free trade.
[00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:18.924]  You've got Obama... But it's not free trade, it's 14,000 pages long, designed where we have all the regulations on us, they have none on them.
[00:55:19.224 --> 00:55:23.566]  It's the same thing with John McCain embracing the global warming garbage.
[00:55:23.946 --> 00:55:24.826]  Yeah, exactly right.
[00:55:24.866 --> 00:55:26.067]  It's not free trade at all.
[00:55:26.407 --> 00:55:27.607]  It's the rubric of free trade.
[00:55:28.007 --> 00:55:32.549]  But, you know, Bob said, you know, look, we're not going to expand NAFTA, we're not going to revamp NAFTA.
[00:55:32.569 --> 00:55:34.470]  When I'm president, we're going to repeal NAFTA.
[00:55:35.011 --> 00:55:36.598]  We're going to repeal CAFTA.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.914]  FTAA is dead away when I become president.
[00:55:40.505 --> 00:55:42.266]  All these are off the table.
[00:55:42.326 --> 00:55:46.629]  I mean, when I become President, Alex, the New World Order comes crashing down.
[00:55:46.649 --> 00:55:52.113]  Well, we can't have somebody who's constitutional and does what the people want and what will save the country.
[00:55:52.373 --> 00:55:54.315]  We've got to further run the country in the ground.
[00:55:54.535 --> 00:55:59.298]  How dare you say that you would do something that everyone in the country wants but the globalists?
[00:56:00.059 --> 00:56:00.939]  This is insane.
[00:56:00.959 --> 00:56:01.820]  You're a radical.
[00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:03.601]  Yeah, well, let me tell you what.
[00:56:03.741 --> 00:56:08.785]  It's time for all of us common people out there, Alex, if we don't start banding together now,
[00:56:09.409 --> 00:56:13.372]  And standing together now, we're not going to have an opportunity to do so in the near future.
[00:56:13.773 --> 00:56:16.915]  Because I think that our country is perilously close.
[00:56:17.416 --> 00:56:19.277]  I think that we are hanging by a thread.
[00:56:19.417 --> 00:56:22.860]  Our freedoms, our liberties... Oh, I can feel it in my spirit!
[00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:23.781]  Can't you, Pastor?
[00:56:23.801 --> 00:56:24.742]  We are hanging by a thread.
[00:56:25.302 --> 00:56:30.606]  I mean, have you ever in your spirit, Pastor, with your discernment, have you ever felt that we're in this much peril?
[00:56:30.666 --> 00:56:31.607]  I mean, I know I haven't.
[00:56:31.807 --> 00:56:32.668]  No, no, never.
[00:56:33.369 --> 00:56:34.309]  I really do believe that.
[00:56:34.409 --> 00:56:36.151]  I think we are hanging by a thread.
[00:56:36.693 --> 00:56:39.175]  And it's time for the American people to stand up now.
[00:56:39.235 --> 00:56:44.019]  It's time for us to band together and to support what we know in our hearts is right.
[00:56:44.119 --> 00:56:47.802]  And quite honestly, I need the support of the people in your audience.
[00:56:47.922 --> 00:56:49.864]  I need people to help me financially.
[00:56:49.884 --> 00:56:56.529]  I need them to tell their friends about my campaign and to help us get on some of these major talk shows to get our message out.
[00:56:56.989 --> 00:57:01.413]  You know, if we don't work together, Alex, if the people that listen to you don't support you,
[00:57:01.949 --> 00:57:03.570]  You're not going to be able to get the message out.
[00:57:03.630 --> 00:57:05.012]  You can't do what you're supposed to do.
[00:57:05.412 --> 00:57:08.955]  And if they don't support me, I can't get the message out and do what God wants me to do.
[00:57:08.995 --> 00:57:09.355]  Yes, sir.
[00:57:09.395 --> 00:57:20.844]  That's why we've had Ron Paul Meetup groups and the Ron Paul March on today, and that's why we've got you on, Pastor Baldwin, because we try to be a platform here with our wonderful audience who are the best.
[00:57:20.864 --> 00:57:23.607]  We just go back to them time and time again, but they always
[00:57:24.347 --> 00:57:28.430]  Uh, come to, you know, the aid again and again, because they know if they don't do it, nobody will.
[00:57:28.770 --> 00:57:31.512]  And you're right, everybody knows it in their gut, not just intellectually.
[00:57:31.832 --> 00:57:35.114]  You intellectually analyze stuff, it is put-up-or-shut-up time.
[00:57:35.495 --> 00:57:36.935]  This is the eye of the storm.
[00:57:37.376 --> 00:57:42.019]  And then you analyze it with your gut, you know, it's just as bad.
[00:57:42.039 --> 00:57:44.220]  I mean, any way you slice it, we're in trouble.
[00:57:44.501 --> 00:57:47.683]  Pastor Chuck Baldwin, running for president, on the Constitution Party ticket.
[00:57:48.083 --> 00:57:48.983]  We're on the march.
[00:57:49.484 --> 00:57:50.985]  The empire's on the run.
[00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:54.782]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:57:58.084 --> 00:58:05.629]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut.
[00:58:06.030 --> 00:58:10.813]  An entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:58:11.233 --> 00:58:15.056]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[00:58:15.336 --> 00:58:15.837]  We're good to go.
[00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:37.420]  I think so.
[00:58:58.246 --> 00:59:08.657]  When I learned that the accumulation of acidic waste was the likely cause of my painful joints, lack of energy, and weight gain, I knew I would have to change to a more alkaline diet, but it just seemed so difficult.
[00:59:08.997 --> 00:59:18.447]  Then a friend suggested I try a Jupiter Water Ionizer from SnyderHealth.com and detox my body even before I changed my diet by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[00:59:18.827 --> 00:59:19.628]  Drinking water?
[00:59:20.108 --> 00:59:21.370]  Now that's something I can handle!
[00:59:21.730 --> 00:59:27.111]  The guys at Snyder Health took the time to explain all of the different options and help me choose the ionizer that was right for me.
[00:59:27.411 --> 00:59:39.214]  I use my new Jupiter ionizer for everything, for drinking, for cooking, and since I've been drinking the water, I have more energy, my joint pains are gone, and I already lost 7 pounds, and my skin looks great!
[00:59:39.514 --> 00:59:42.135]  Give them a call today at 877-356-2508 to find out which ionizer is right for you.
[00:59:46.536 --> 00:59:51.199]  They offer a full 30-day money-back guarantee and free shipping, so there's absolutely no risk.
[00:59:51.419 --> 00:59:53.940]  You can visit them on the web at SnyderHealth.com.
[00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:56.902]  That's S-N-Y-D-E-R-Health.com.
[00:59:57.822 --> 01:00:03.705]  Attention GCN listeners, would you like to watch uncensored, unregulated, even banned TV on your computer?
[01:00:03.826 --> 01:00:15.272]  Well, now you can watch satellite TV on your PC with an extremely simple hookup that allows computer owners to pick up more channels than any sane person can even watch without paying monthly cable or satellite fees.
[01:00:15.692 --> 01:00:16.532]  Here's the story.
[01:00:16.832 --> 01:00:24.695]  New video feed technology lets anyone with a high-speed internet connection gain instant access to an endless list of underground channels from all over the globe.
[01:00:24.996 --> 01:00:26.056]  And here's the best part.
[01:00:26.136 --> 01:00:27.437]  It's 100% legal.
[01:00:27.837 --> 01:00:33.899]  And it works at home, the office, or even in other countries to grab television channels and video feeds at your command.
[01:00:34.259 --> 01:00:34.839]  I think so.
[01:01:04.668 --> 01:01:15.816]  All right, let's go straight back to Pastor Chuck Baldwin running for president, and I've been interrupting so much because I'm so excited with what he's saying, and I want to give him a few minutes to talk about whatever issues he wants, and we're going right to your phone calls.
[01:01:16.496 --> 01:01:18.117]  Go ahead, Pastor Baldwin.
[01:01:18.878 --> 01:01:21.780]  Yeah, thank you very much, Alex, and can I put out the website to your audience?
[01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:22.520]  Absolutely.
[01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:26.703]  Oh yeah, it's www.baldwino8.com.
[01:01:26.803 --> 01:01:28.204]  That's baldwino8.com.
[01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:35.102]  And if somebody wants to contact us, we have a toll-free number, and that number is 888-USA-1911.
[01:01:35.522 --> 01:01:38.124]  That's 888-USA-1911.
[01:01:38.144 --> 01:01:40.865]  And I appreciate that very much.
[01:01:40.905 --> 01:01:47.147]  Yeah, you know, our platform is very specifically, we want to return America to constitutional government.
[01:01:47.548 --> 01:01:52.410]  We believe that without constitutional government, our freedoms and our liberties are in peril.
[01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:57.372]  And it's absolutely essential right now that we return to
[01:01:58.109 --> 01:02:02.732]  The principles as outlined in the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights.
[01:02:03.132 --> 01:02:12.397]  And by the way, just to let your audience know, I'm going to be speaking this Saturday with Dr. Ron Paul at his big Freedom March rally in Washington, D.C.
[01:02:12.437 --> 01:02:13.157]  this Saturday.
[01:02:14.038 --> 01:02:22.602]  In fact, if I understand my place on the platform, I'm going to be speaking right directly in front of him this Saturday afternoon in Washington, D.C.
[01:02:23.303 --> 01:02:27.445]  Yes, I had the organizers on earlier today and they said that is the case.
[01:02:28.030 --> 01:02:29.051]  Oh yeah, great, terrific.
[01:02:29.091 --> 01:02:30.412]  Well, I'm glad I got that right.
[01:02:30.873 --> 01:02:32.294]  But I'm looking forward to doing that.
[01:02:32.334 --> 01:02:35.517]  You know, he picked up the banner there for us in the primary.
[01:02:35.537 --> 01:02:40.962]  And as you know, I supported him during the primary season and did everything I could to try to help him win the nomination.
[01:02:41.663 --> 01:02:50.011]  And whenever it became obvious that the Republican Party was going to reject his candidacy, then of course I became the nominee of the Constitution Party.
[01:02:50.427 --> 01:02:55.489]  And we just really believe that that message that Ron Paul was preaching is the message that we've got to continue.
[01:02:55.749 --> 01:03:07.033]  We just have to continue the message of less government and getting back to the principles as articulated by the Founding Fathers and getting government off of our backs and out of our pocketbooks.
[01:03:07.434 --> 01:03:09.214]  Start being Americans again.
[01:03:09.554 --> 01:03:11.955]  We're not ashamed of that message, America first.
[01:03:12.115 --> 01:03:16.057]  It's still America, the free America.
[01:03:16.699 --> 01:03:17.760]  The home of the brave.
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:20.521]  We believe in our independence and our sovereignty.
[01:03:20.581 --> 01:03:26.844]  We reject these New World Order policies that both of the parties are perpetrating against us.
[01:03:26.964 --> 01:03:28.365]  And if we don't do it now, in 2008,
[01:03:30.599 --> 01:03:33.742]  I'm not sure that we're going to have many more elections that we're going to be able to do it.
[01:03:33.902 --> 01:03:34.643]  It's real simple.
[01:03:34.723 --> 01:03:35.283]  The U.S.
[01:03:35.343 --> 01:03:37.765]  is the big engine, the big dominant system, or was.
[01:03:38.325 --> 01:03:49.694]  Powerful financial interests, predominantly multinational and foreign, came in, bought control of our government, have run out our credit, buying up real assets for themselves, and now they know they've committed great crimes.
[01:03:49.714 --> 01:03:53.798]  They're building a police state and immunity to protect themselves.
[01:03:54.778 --> 01:03:57.661]  And we even got the IMF and World Bank documents in 2002.
[01:03:57.701 --> 01:03:58.922]  They were planning to do this.
[01:03:59.622 --> 01:04:03.047]  I mean, we know they are carrying out a criminal operation.
[01:04:03.628 --> 01:04:05.431]  We know the government's rogue.
[01:04:05.631 --> 01:04:08.896]  It's against the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, against what the people want.
[01:04:10.775 --> 01:04:14.898]  And so many crazy things are happening that this is it.
[01:04:15.098 --> 01:04:18.841]  And again, the good news is, the bad news, we have a rogue government.
[01:04:18.941 --> 01:04:28.548]  The good news, that the constitutional position is the popular one, and the mainstream media is losing its control and losing its monopoly.
[01:04:29.088 --> 01:04:33.592]  And so we're in a very important sea change right now, a fork in the road.
[01:04:33.932 --> 01:04:34.853]  Which way are we going to go?
[01:04:35.593 --> 01:04:39.535]  And people could say Chuck Ball will never win.
[01:04:39.595 --> 01:04:41.456]  Well, you could say Ron Paul would never win.
[01:04:41.756 --> 01:04:52.661]  Now we have tens of millions of young people out fighting open borders, gun control, the New World Order, NAFTA, GATT, trans-Texas highways, super highways, the NAU.
[01:04:55.442 --> 01:04:58.123]  Well, no, they're not invincible.
[01:04:58.143 --> 01:04:59.603]  It's still we the people.
[01:04:59.623 --> 01:05:04.124]  We still are the greatest force under God in this country, and people need to remember that.
[01:05:04.204 --> 01:05:10.465]  You know, I'm reminded of the election of 1860, and while I'm not a big fan of Abraham Lincoln, the man and the president,
[01:05:24.322 --> 01:05:24.923]  I would go back.
[01:05:24.983 --> 01:05:32.268]  I was asked just this morning, I had a radio interview, a nationwide show, and they said, well, you know, you don't have a chance to win.
[01:05:32.308 --> 01:05:41.095]  I said, well, you know, if you were talking to Abraham Lincoln back in 1860, you would have said the same thing, because the Republican Party was a minor party at that time.
[01:05:41.435 --> 01:05:44.738]  They had elected no one to federal office to that point.
[01:05:45.178 --> 01:05:50.142]  Abraham Lincoln himself had been defeated time after time after time in every race that he ran in.
[01:05:50.683 --> 01:05:59.814]  And here he was running for the president in 1860 on a minor party ticket, and lo and behold, in that election, he won in a four-man race with 39% of the vote.
[01:06:00.155 --> 01:06:03.138]  And then, of course, the Republican Party became a major party.
[01:06:03.178 --> 01:06:04.300]  The Whigs disappeared.
[01:06:04.747 --> 01:06:07.288]  And for the last 140 years, we've had the Democrats and Republicans.
[01:06:07.308 --> 01:06:09.148]  And that was the last major realignment.
[01:06:09.188 --> 01:06:13.070]  And so what we know is, if you and others don't fight, they're going to win.
[01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:15.030]  Resistance is victory.
[01:06:15.550 --> 01:06:15.970]  Exactly.
[01:06:16.070 --> 01:06:17.651]  And who knows what can happen?
[01:06:17.691 --> 01:06:21.332]  You know, you quoted that from John Quincy Adams, and I love that quote.
[01:06:21.372 --> 01:06:23.113]  Duty is ours, results are God's.
[01:06:23.173 --> 01:06:26.714]  And who knows what God may want to do in 2008 with our efforts?
[01:06:26.774 --> 01:06:27.334]  Who knows?
[01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:28.571]  What do you think?
[01:06:44.076 --> 01:06:46.079]  Well, it's also the example of the Alamo.
[01:06:46.159 --> 01:06:55.253]  Those men said victory or death, and they knew what they were doing, and the fact is that 180-something of them died fighting at least 5,000 other soldiers, but that example
[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:06.226]  That being overrun, being killed, standing up, fighting overwhelming odds, then embolden others to fight and win.
[01:07:06.886 --> 01:07:10.509]  And I'm not saying you're going to get wiped out or massacred.
[01:07:10.549 --> 01:07:15.334]  The point is, that is an example of duty being ours.
[01:07:16.074 --> 01:07:24.597]  And that you never know what God's great plan is for us, but we have to do the right thing no matter what is going to come of it.
[01:07:25.117 --> 01:07:30.819]  And so again, folks, we'll give out his phone number and web address for you to try to support the campaign.
[01:07:31.419 --> 01:07:32.500]  He's got a great platform.
[01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:33.640]  I agree with it 100%.
[01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:35.281]  I hope you'll check it out for yourself.
[01:07:35.341 --> 01:07:36.501]  Right now, let's take some calls.
[01:07:36.841 --> 01:07:37.882]  Ben in New York City.
[01:07:37.902 --> 01:07:41.183]  You're on the air with the Constitution Party's presidential candidate, Chuck Baldwin.
[01:07:41.223 --> 01:07:41.543]  Go ahead.
[01:07:42.662 --> 01:07:43.602]  Hi, guys.
[01:07:43.702 --> 01:07:46.243]  Chuck, it's great to have you on the show today.
[01:07:46.583 --> 01:07:50.064]  I want to say that one thing Alex, you just said there, you said, if we don't fight, we don't win.
[01:07:50.465 --> 01:07:58.767]  Baker Hoover once said that only an informed citizenry can defeat the New World Order or defeat who he believed were the New World Order.
[01:07:59.227 --> 01:08:08.450]  One thing I wanted to ask Chuck about really quick was, Asher Topp-Benson was Eisenhower's Agricultural Secretary, and he was quite an ardent and outspoken constitutionalist.
[01:08:08.790 --> 01:08:10.491]  How much have you heard of him, Chuck, at all?
[01:08:12.248 --> 01:08:13.489]  No, I'm not real familiar with him, no.
[01:08:14.730 --> 01:08:16.871]  Yeah, well, he was very outspoken back in the 50s.
[01:08:16.911 --> 01:08:19.033]  He was Agricultural Secretary under Eisenhower.
[01:08:19.553 --> 01:08:23.356]  And he spoke out boldly about defending the Constitution.
[01:08:23.376 --> 01:08:30.461]  And there was a senator called William Jenner, about the same time, gave a very bold speech to the Senate.
[01:08:30.541 --> 01:08:40.008]  And his final statement in that speech was that he believed there was a collectivist, one-party group trying to set up
[01:08:40.484 --> 01:08:41.705]  And that's why they're incremental.
[01:08:41.725 --> 01:08:41.966]  Absolutely.
[01:08:41.986 --> 01:08:42.526]  I appreciate your call.
[01:08:42.566 --> 01:08:44.128]  Comments on that, Chuck Baldwin?
[01:09:00.851 --> 01:09:04.152]  Well, yeah, he's right, and incrementalism has never served our purposes.
[01:09:04.232 --> 01:09:10.474]  It's always served the other side, and that's what they've been doing for years, and now they're almost to the fruition part of their plan.
[01:09:11.074 --> 01:09:22.837]  And again, I go back to what you said, Alex, I think it's incumbent upon each of us to recognize that when we stand up together and do what's right out of principle, that then we invoke, I believe, the power of God.
[01:09:22.877 --> 01:09:27.298]  And of course, being a Christian, I do believe that God governs in the affairs of men, to quote Benjamin Franklin.
[01:09:27.873 --> 01:09:35.718]  And I do believe that when those founding fathers stood up against the greatest military force in the world, Great Britain, it was impossible that they could have won.
[01:09:35.758 --> 01:09:38.840]  I mean, it was impossible from a human standpoint that they could have prevailed.
[01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:40.401]  But they did what was right.
[01:09:40.441 --> 01:09:42.502]  They pledged their lives, their fortunes, their sacred honor.
[01:09:42.522 --> 01:09:44.684]  And they put it in God's hands.
[01:09:44.724 --> 01:09:46.445]  They said, you will decide.
[01:09:46.825 --> 01:09:47.125]  That's right.
[01:09:47.165 --> 01:09:47.726]  That's what they said.
[01:09:47.766 --> 01:09:50.147]  We looked into God for the rectitude of our intentions.
[01:09:50.207 --> 01:09:50.828]  Exactly right.
[01:09:50.848 --> 01:09:52.008]  They said, we're going to do what's right.
[01:09:52.028 --> 01:09:54.670]  We're going to stand up against all these odds, no matter what.
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:58.304]  We're going to let God decide our victory or not.
[01:09:58.664 --> 01:10:01.347]  And they did what was right, and God gave them the victory.
[01:10:01.367 --> 01:10:03.229]  And I think that's what God is waiting for today.
[01:10:03.329 --> 01:10:11.939]  I really believe that if Christian people and conservatives and constitutionalists out there that know what's right in 2008 would just stand up and do what's right.
[01:10:12.412 --> 01:10:18.975]  And forget what the experts and the pundits say they should do, and what's the pragmatic approach to take, and just do what's right on principle.
[01:10:19.115 --> 01:10:20.716]  Who knows what will happen?
[01:10:20.756 --> 01:10:21.636]  Who knows what God will do?
[01:10:21.656 --> 01:10:36.802]  Regardless, you're going to go out and reach hundreds of thousands and millions of people, and it's the exercise of fighting that grows the party, that grows the ideas, that lets people know there's an alternative at a time when the minds are more fertile than ever to accept the truth.
[01:10:36.862 --> 01:10:37.703]  Let's talk to Dave.
[01:10:38.343 --> 01:10:38.623]  You bet.
[01:10:38.643 --> 01:10:40.003]  Let's talk to Dave in Vancouver.
[01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:43.044]  Dave, you're on the air with Pastor Chuck Baldwin, running for President.
[01:10:43.864 --> 01:10:45.785]  Hi Alex, and hi Mr. Baldwin.
[01:10:45.985 --> 01:10:47.485]  I'd like to go quickly.
[01:10:47.905 --> 01:10:57.007]  First of all, I'd like to thank Mr. Baldwin for his courage and best of luck to you, sir, in restoring the Constitution of the United States, which I admire even being a Canadian all my life.
[01:10:57.107 --> 01:11:07.109]  I think it's very important that the United States stay a free country so that the rest of the world can look to it as the shining city on the hill and aspire to that kind of freedom.
[01:11:07.529 --> 01:11:12.551]  I don't think that Canada has the kind of freedom that the United States has even now, and I live here.
[01:11:13.511 --> 01:11:27.157]  I'd like to also thank Mr. Ball for exemplifying the Judeo-Christian values that most of us, whether you subscribe to religion or not, claim to be if we say we're a good person.
[01:11:27.997 --> 01:11:34.760]  And it was also really well shown by Beit Shalom Ministries and Alex, your recent work, Truth Rising,
[01:11:35.784 --> 01:11:36.384]  I loved it.
[01:11:36.524 --> 01:11:45.407]  I think it's certainly your best work and I think it's probably also the best 9-11 documentary so far because it provides social proof where the others have provided evidence.
[01:11:46.467 --> 01:11:50.008]  Well, it provides evidence as well as social proof, but absolutely.
[01:11:50.188 --> 01:11:50.369]  Yeah.
[01:11:51.929 --> 01:11:53.870]  Now, this is putting a face on this movement.
[01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:54.930]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:11:54.970 --> 01:11:56.570]  Great things you said there.
[01:11:56.590 --> 01:11:58.191]  Next caller for Chuck Baldwin.
[01:11:59.291 --> 01:12:00.412]  Dana in Iowa.
[01:12:00.432 --> 01:12:01.032]  You're on the air.
[01:12:02.932 --> 01:12:04.273]  Hey, I'm actually on the air.
[01:12:04.773 --> 01:12:04.973]  Yes.
[01:12:07.931 --> 01:12:17.845]  I was wondering with this whole Illuminati thing, it seems like anyone I try to talk to about it or inform people, they just look at me like I'm nuts.
[01:12:18.246 --> 01:12:19.788]  I'm just wondering, is it
[01:12:20.891 --> 01:12:26.415]  Well, maybe you should start slower with your circle that you're interacting with.
[01:12:26.475 --> 01:12:28.736]  Some areas people are awake, some areas they're not.
[01:12:29.256 --> 01:12:31.017]  And start with the North American Union.
[01:12:31.057 --> 01:12:35.941]  Go to judicialwatch.org and get the documents about how they're doing it or give them
[01:12:36.821 --> 01:12:37.862]  My film, Endgame.
[01:12:37.882 --> 01:12:42.805]  If you can't afford it, it's on Google Video, but you can see it in high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:12:42.825 --> 01:12:44.487]  You can give them your passcode if you're a member.
[01:12:45.267 --> 01:12:46.668]  Give them a copy of Truth Rising.
[01:12:46.708 --> 01:12:47.589]  Make copies of it.
[01:12:48.049 --> 01:12:55.395]  I mean, really, instead of just talking to your family or friends, a lot of times a salesman will tell you, it's harder to sell your own family
[01:12:56.135 --> 01:13:12.386]  I mean, I could be at an event with cousins and family, and they treat me like I'm a low-grade moron two-year-old, and then I could have, you know, members of the Japanese Parliament or an Italian President or German Defense Minister, you know, tell me how much they respect me and admire me.
[01:13:12.806 --> 01:13:13.747]  I mean, it's the same thing.
[01:13:13.787 --> 01:13:15.888]  Like, a prophet isn't known in his own country.
[01:13:16.289 --> 01:13:19.511]  I'm not saying we're prophets, but my point is that old saying is true.
[01:13:21.352 --> 01:13:24.054]  Your family thinks you're trying to show off.
[01:13:24.534 --> 01:13:29.638]  And so, or your co-workers, so give them a film and just say, hey, tell me what you think of this.
[01:13:30.339 --> 01:13:33.181]  Chuck Baldwin, you want to comment on ways to reach out to people?
[01:13:33.882 --> 01:13:36.784]  Yeah, I think your approach is very well taken.
[01:13:36.804 --> 01:13:46.992]  You know, we have to try to educate people beginning at the level where they are, and I think the one thing that people can identify with today is the immigration problem.
[01:13:47.072 --> 01:13:52.076]  I think this is the great opportunity that we have to try and explain to people what's going on when they
[01:13:52.489 --> 01:13:56.911]  They shake their heads and say, you know, why doesn't George W. Bush want to close the borders?
[01:13:57.371 --> 01:14:02.353]  You know, I was just down there on the borders, I told you earlier in the broadcast, and I saw the plight of our Border Patrol people.
[01:14:02.973 --> 01:14:11.776]  Alex, I was shocked to find out that our Border Patrol personnel, out of spite of the fact that they are sadly understaffed, they don't even have GPS equipment.
[01:14:11.936 --> 01:14:12.616]  I didn't know that.
[01:14:13.036 --> 01:14:15.017]  I didn't know that they didn't have night vision equipment.
[01:14:15.037 --> 01:14:20.179]  Can you imagine putting our Border Patrol out there, out in the middle of nowhere, understaffed, outgunned,
[01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:23.792]  And they don't even have GPS equipment, and they don't have night vision equipment.
[01:14:23.832 --> 01:14:39.649]  Well, half their duty now is picking up trash in the woods and in the scrub brush, and when they park their car on those grids, which the illegals all have maps of, the coyote smugglers, they're only allowed to look one direction, and if they see illegals in the other direction, they're not allowed to stop them.
[01:14:40.492 --> 01:14:47.180]  Well, what I'm saying is, I think when people look at this and they say, well, you know, why is not this administration willing to secure our borders?
[01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:53.588]  While we're fighting terror halfway around the world, ostensibly, why are we not closing our own borders to illegal aliens?
[01:14:53.628 --> 01:14:56.231]  And then you can explain to them, you know, look, you know,
[01:14:57.091 --> 01:15:00.054]  This orphan border policy is serving a bigger agenda.
[01:15:00.094 --> 01:15:08.560]  You can talk about what's going on is the creation of the North American Union, and they want to merge the trilateral government from the United States.
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:10.581]  And it's in all their public documents.
[01:15:10.601 --> 01:15:14.104]  They have joint sessions of Congress down there, and they talk to the public.
[01:15:14.804 --> 01:15:15.605]  I mean, I live in Texas.
[01:15:15.645 --> 01:15:19.748]  I'll never forget CNN and Fox doing reports saying, Ron Paul's nuts.
[01:15:19.828 --> 01:15:23.852]  He believes in a thing called the Trans-Texas Corridor, and it doesn't exist.
[01:15:23.952 --> 01:15:24.913]  And the thing's built.
[01:15:25.253 --> 01:15:27.115]  TV ads, signs everywhere.
[01:15:27.135 --> 01:15:27.915]  Right.
[01:15:28.215 --> 01:15:30.257]  And people in Texas, that woke a lot of people up.
[01:15:30.277 --> 01:15:32.119]  They went, what do you mean it doesn't exist?
[01:15:32.599 --> 01:15:33.280]  Absolutely.
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:39.265]  And I've often talked about those folks down there in Texas that are fighting for us like the defenders of the Alamo did.
[01:15:39.784 --> 01:15:47.591]  So many years ago, you were out there on the front lines defending us from this trance, this North American community and the NAFTA superhighway.
[01:15:47.631 --> 01:15:49.453]  You guys were on the front lines there in Texas.
[01:15:49.793 --> 01:16:02.284]  But what I'm saying is, I think that this affords us an opportunity to educate people as to what's going on in our government today, to recognize that there is something sinister afoot here, and here's what we can do to stop it.
[01:16:02.324 --> 01:16:06.248]  And American people need to understand that they do have the power to stop it,
[01:16:06.866 --> 01:16:16.774]  And I really do believe that if people will come together and will, you know, oppose these things and do it in a united effort, there's no telling what will happen this year.
[01:16:17.114 --> 01:16:17.634]  Absolutely.
[01:16:17.654 --> 01:16:21.938]  I want to take a few final calls here and we've got to let Chuck Baldwin go on to another interview.
[01:16:22.898 --> 01:16:25.220]  Let's take one final call from Scott in Arizona.
[01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:26.661]  You're on the air with Chuck Baldwin.
[01:16:26.701 --> 01:16:27.302]  Go ahead, Scott.
[01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:33.694]  Yeah, Mr. Baldwin, I wanted to find out if you have had any luck with any of the major media outlets.
[01:16:33.854 --> 01:16:37.057]  I know Rob Paul did get some play in that.
[01:16:37.077 --> 01:16:42.361]  I wanted to know if you had any luck there, and do you have a running mate in mind as well?
[01:16:43.022 --> 01:16:44.443]  Oh yeah, I already have my running mate.
[01:16:44.523 --> 01:16:45.444]  He's a great guy.
[01:16:45.544 --> 01:16:48.026]  He's a Vietnam vet in the United States Marine Corps.
[01:16:48.678 --> 01:16:49.239]  A veteran.
[01:16:49.279 --> 01:16:51.981]  He's a practicing attorney in Memphis, Tennessee.
[01:16:52.021 --> 01:16:54.943]  His name is Darryl Castle and he's a great guy.
[01:16:54.983 --> 01:16:56.365]  I'm proud to have him on my ticket.
[01:16:57.245 --> 01:17:02.810]  Yes, we're very hopeful that we'll be able to break into the mainstream television network.
[01:17:02.830 --> 01:17:06.433]  So we're especially hopeful that Lou Dobbs or Glenn Beck will pick us up.
[01:17:06.553 --> 01:17:08.395]  I encourage your listeners, Alex, to
[01:17:08.962 --> 01:17:15.808]  To encourage the Lou Dobbs Show and the Glenn Beck Show to have us on, because we think that they would be receptive to our message.
[01:17:15.848 --> 01:17:17.249]  And we have been on some of the national.
[01:17:17.509 --> 01:17:23.994]  We made it to Bill O'Reilly the other night in a mention, and I did Reason Magazine interview with them.
[01:17:24.054 --> 01:17:26.156]  I was in Salt Lake Tribune, which is a major newspaper.
[01:17:26.196 --> 01:17:28.538]  I was with the Orange County Register, a major newspaper.
[01:17:28.578 --> 01:17:31.881]  And you're doing a lot of radio interviews every day, which has big audiences.
[01:17:32.221 --> 01:17:37.045]  I mean, O'Reilly and them, it's only 3 million viewers, and a lot of radio shows have that many listeners.
[01:17:37.365 --> 01:17:38.186]  I know this one does.
[01:17:39.086 --> 01:17:53.915]  Now, in closing, I want to give out the website again and tell folks how to get involved, but I also just want to add, that's how the media, and I know everybody knows this, but we need to consciously think about it, how they ignore all the other candidates and only talk about the two, who really, there's no difference between them.
[01:17:54.896 --> 01:18:04.001]  Again, that's another reason to put pressure on the media, not just for Chuck Baldwin, but to overall show how they restrict the field intentionally.
[01:18:04.605 --> 01:18:05.465]  Right, exactly right.
[01:18:05.565 --> 01:18:07.226]  Yeah, I appreciate the opportunity.
[01:18:07.306 --> 01:18:10.588]  The website is bald108.com.
[01:18:10.868 --> 01:18:13.329]  www.bald108.com.
[01:18:13.829 --> 01:18:17.710]  And the toll-free number, for more information or to volunteer to help us or whatever, 888...
[01:18:19.546 --> 01:18:20.887]  USA 1911.
[01:18:21.527 --> 01:18:24.228]  That's 888-USA-1911.
[01:18:24.688 --> 01:18:27.869]  Pastor Baldwin running for President on the Constitution Party ticket.
[01:18:27.929 --> 01:18:29.069]  The party is growing.
[01:18:29.529 --> 01:18:31.110]  It's in all your major cities and states.
[01:18:31.610 --> 01:18:32.710]  Check into it today.
[01:18:33.331 --> 01:18:34.811]  And God bless you.
[01:18:34.871 --> 01:18:36.332]  Have a great trip there in D.C.
[01:18:36.352 --> 01:18:37.272]  Speaking with the Congressman.
[01:18:37.312 --> 01:18:38.232]  Say hi to him for me.
[01:18:38.592 --> 01:18:39.072]  Thank you.
[01:18:39.393 --> 01:18:40.553]  Thank you, Pastor Baldwin.
[01:18:41.013 --> 01:18:41.834]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:18:41.854 --> 01:18:42.434]  Appreciate it very much.
[01:18:42.454 --> 01:18:43.194]  Keep up the good work.
[01:18:43.315 --> 01:18:44.035]  You too, my friend.
[01:18:44.555 --> 01:18:50.519]  We'll be right back with some news clips and other info before Dr. Paul Gregg Roberts joins us.
[01:18:50.939 --> 01:18:51.760]  He'll be with us for 30 minutes.
[01:18:51.780 --> 01:18:55.222]  Then I'm going to play the Declaration of Independence audio on air.
[01:18:55.322 --> 01:18:56.223]  Totally jam-packed.
[01:18:56.243 --> 01:18:56.703]  Stay with us.
[01:18:58.584 --> 01:19:00.245]  Life has changed.
[01:19:00.646 --> 01:19:02.087]  We're not 21 anymore.
[01:19:02.467 --> 01:19:04.168]  We have responsibilities.
[01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:08.083]  That's why there's drinkin' made hangover defense.
[01:19:08.564 --> 01:19:10.166]  Sure, we've done our share of partying.
[01:19:10.246 --> 01:19:10.967]  Yeah, dude.
[01:19:11.047 --> 01:19:14.631]  Now, kickin' back with the neighbors and a few beers is more our style.
[01:19:15.172 --> 01:19:20.599]  But let's face it, as we get older, even that can leave us feeling run down the next morning.
[01:19:21.542 --> 01:19:26.163]  With Drink and Mate, you can have a few drinks tonight without waking up feeling like you had a few.
[01:19:26.503 --> 01:19:37.685]  Drink and Mate's patented and proven formula of guava leaf extract has antioxidants and other unique properties that help prevent the headache, queasy stomach, and dehydration even a few drinks can leave behind.
[01:19:38.205 --> 01:19:41.786]  Just dissolve one Drink and Mate in water and take it before bed.
[01:19:42.046 --> 01:19:42.706]  It's that easy.
[01:19:43.526 --> 01:19:45.827]  The next morning, bring on the responsibilities.
[01:19:47.435 --> 01:19:50.896]  Drink and Mate Hangover Defense is available at retailers nationwide.
[01:19:51.276 --> 01:19:52.096]  Pick up some today!
[01:19:52.936 --> 01:19:55.797]  Remember your drink and mate, and wake up feeling great!
[01:19:56.977 --> 01:19:59.017]  May I have everybody's attention please?
[01:19:59.117 --> 01:20:01.538]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:20:01.558 --> 01:20:03.798]  9-11 was an inside job!
[01:20:03.838 --> 01:20:05.358]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:20:05.378 --> 01:20:06.999]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:20:07.079 --> 01:20:09.919]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:20:09.979 --> 01:20:13.600]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:20:23.254 --> 01:20:28.178]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:20:28.398 --> 01:20:30.560]  An inside job?
[01:20:31.921 --> 01:20:34.203]  How dare you?
[01:20:34.363 --> 01:20:39.427]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:20:39.447 --> 01:20:42.229]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:20:42.329 --> 01:20:44.871]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years,
[01:20:46.877 --> 01:20:48.741]  Truth Rising.
[01:20:48.801 --> 01:20:51.387]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[01:20:51.627 --> 01:20:53.652]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:20:53.912 --> 01:20:56.398]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:20:58.428 --> 01:21:02.632]  Would you like to know how you can use water as fuel and laugh at the rising price of gas?
[01:21:02.833 --> 01:21:04.815]  Then keep listening for a very special offer.
[01:21:04.975 --> 01:21:10.120]  GasFreedom.info has the information you need to learn about a simple technology you can have right now.
[01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:14.565]  GasFreedom is a do-it-yourself, affordable, practical, free-energy device.
[01:21:14.825 --> 01:21:19.210]  It uses electricity from your car's battery to separate water into a gas called HHO.
[01:21:21.431 --> 01:21:22.312]  We're good to go!
[01:21:45.095 --> 01:21:46.196]  The Gambler understands!
[01:21:46.216 --> 01:21:46.636]  Ha ha!
[01:22:17.890 --> 01:22:19.511]  My heart is playing it through.
[01:22:19.591 --> 01:22:20.231]  I'm committed.
[01:22:22.452 --> 01:22:23.553]  I'll take my chances.
[01:22:26.694 --> 01:22:27.615]  Again and again.
[01:22:35.679 --> 01:22:39.041]  It is such a good feeling to be committed to something that you know is good.
[01:22:42.582 --> 01:22:43.383]  You don't have to worry.
[01:22:46.445 --> 01:22:48.747]  The course is set, the die is cast.
[01:22:50.969 --> 01:22:52.010]  Ramming speed.
[01:22:55.514 --> 01:22:59.077]  A lot of people out there can't see the wreckage we've caused the New World Order.
[01:22:59.878 --> 01:23:01.139]  How much we've discredited them.
[01:23:03.562 --> 01:23:04.923]  How hated they now are.
[01:23:05.664 --> 01:23:06.785]  How scared they are.
[01:23:08.567 --> 01:23:21.245]  And as we resist them and only make them squeeze tighter and pour on the propaganda and accelerate their program that's already rattling apart and smoking and on fire, their system is going to be wrecked.
[01:23:22.636 --> 01:23:35.523]  The question is, will we be crushed in this colossus collapse, or will we be able to short-circuit their program and get some kind of reprieve for this society from this great tyranny?
[01:23:35.883 --> 01:23:42.946]  Tyranny comes every generation, but the tyranny we're witnessing now is one of the worst in history, and potentially the worst ever.
[01:23:44.067 --> 01:23:45.628]  Very, very serious times we're in.
[01:23:45.968 --> 01:23:47.389]  Truth Rising is out.
[01:23:48.434 --> 01:23:49.315]  on DVD.
[01:23:49.335 --> 01:23:51.296]  I am very proud of the film.
[01:23:51.776 --> 01:23:52.837]  It needs to be seen.
[01:23:53.337 --> 01:23:55.658]  I'm asking all of you to purchase the DVD.
[01:23:56.019 --> 01:23:59.161]  That gives us seed money to make further films, but then I want you
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:03.282]  to crazily make copies of the DVD.
[01:24:03.322 --> 01:24:03.982]  It's a DVD-5.
[01:24:04.062 --> 01:24:10.787]  The film's just at two hours and it's got only eight minutes of extra so you can burn this to other DVD-5s.
[01:24:11.387 --> 01:24:15.189]  Any classic side-by-side DVD burner will do this.
[01:24:16.230 --> 01:24:19.532]  You can buy them cheap and make a lot of copies and get them out to everybody.
[01:24:20.533 --> 01:24:25.316]  Or if you've got the funds, buy a bunch of copies and get them out to people.
[01:24:26.605 --> 01:24:28.906]  And we don't have time to wait for orders from headquarters here.
[01:24:29.807 --> 01:24:30.788]  There is no headquarters.
[01:24:30.888 --> 01:24:31.688]  It is up to you.
[01:24:31.708 --> 01:24:34.990]  It is in your hands what you're going to do with Truth Rising.
[01:24:35.950 --> 01:24:39.152]  If you haven't seen it yet, go to PrisonPlanet.tv and check it out right now.
[01:24:39.172 --> 01:24:47.017]  I want to thank all of you that are members of PrisonPlanet.tv and are burning copies of these daily TV reports we do, burning copies of the weekly TV reports we do in studio.
[01:24:48.257 --> 01:24:53.543]  The Sunday show we tape, the guests we have in studio, all 19 of my films.
[01:24:54.324 --> 01:24:56.847]  I mean, every issue you can imagine is up there.
[01:24:56.888 --> 01:24:59.711]  You can burn it to disc, give it to people, educate them.
[01:24:59.851 --> 01:25:07.601]  These TV shows we do, these radio shows are effective and are reaching out to people in a big, big way.
[01:25:08.081 --> 01:25:12.825]  We know we are giving fight to the enemy and we are hurting them.
[01:25:12.865 --> 01:25:13.946]  We are damaging them.
[01:25:14.527 --> 01:25:17.189]  We are tearing their guts out, okay?
[01:25:17.769 --> 01:25:20.131]  And they're going to keep telling you that you're not hurting them.
[01:25:20.151 --> 01:25:22.173]  They're going to keep telling you that you're not having an effect.
[01:25:22.193 --> 01:25:26.597]  They're going to keep telling you they don't exist when they're right in front of you carrying out their operations.
[01:25:28.168 --> 01:25:29.330]  They hate my guts.
[01:25:29.991 --> 01:25:36.280]  The only reason they haven't killed me is they don't want to underline, they don't want to highlight, they don't want to put an exclamation point behind all my work.
[01:25:36.821 --> 01:25:42.068]  Doing that would only build me up and only make my work stronger.
[01:25:43.561 --> 01:25:44.602]  But that's one area of my work.
[01:25:44.642 --> 01:25:45.622]  I don't want it to be stronger.
[01:25:45.642 --> 01:25:46.403]  I want to keep living.
[01:25:46.443 --> 01:25:47.003]  I love life.
[01:25:48.144 --> 01:25:49.485]  That's why they're trying to discredit me.
[01:25:49.745 --> 01:25:51.986]  Classic COINTELPRO is being carried out against me.
[01:25:52.687 --> 01:25:54.008]  I mean, just out of the woodwork.
[01:25:54.348 --> 01:25:57.910]  And then a lot of weak-minded people that are helping the feds unknowingly.
[01:25:58.630 --> 01:25:59.971]  But that's okay, folks.
[01:26:00.011 --> 01:26:00.932]  That's what I'm here for.
[01:26:01.032 --> 01:26:02.333]  I'm here to fight the globalists.
[01:26:02.833 --> 01:26:03.874]  I'm here to take the heat.
[01:26:03.974 --> 01:26:05.195]  I'm here to take the punches.
[01:26:05.575 --> 01:26:07.436]  I'm here to take the hatred and the attacks.
[01:26:07.756 --> 01:26:08.537]  I am committed.
[01:26:08.917 --> 01:26:11.899]  And frankly, it lets me know I'm having a big effect that it's happening.
[01:26:12.199 --> 01:26:15.201]  But I don't want it to become a diversion or a distraction.
[01:26:16.442 --> 01:26:19.284]  That's why I ask the listeners of this show, do not defend me.
[01:26:20.045 --> 01:26:20.405]  Okay?
[01:26:20.945 --> 01:26:22.266]  Warn people about fluoride.
[01:26:22.346 --> 01:26:23.607]  Warn them about globalism.
[01:26:23.647 --> 01:26:25.188]  Warn them about mercury in the shots.
[01:26:25.228 --> 01:26:27.610]  Warn them about the Iran war.
[01:26:28.030 --> 01:26:29.451]  Warn them about CPS.
[01:26:30.272 --> 01:26:31.072]  Help people.
[01:26:31.172 --> 01:26:34.214]  Spend your time warning and helping those that don't know.
[01:26:34.455 --> 01:26:35.796]  Do not defend me.
[01:26:36.036 --> 01:26:36.936]  Leave me behind.
[01:26:36.956 --> 01:26:40.479]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:26:43.528 --> 01:26:47.510]  Alright, let's get, uh... ...to become a diversion or a distraction.
[01:26:48.731 --> 01:26:51.572]  That's why I ask the listeners of this show, do not defend me.
[01:26:52.352 --> 01:26:52.692]  Okay?
[01:26:53.213 --> 01:26:54.553]  Warn people about fluoride.
[01:26:54.633 --> 01:26:55.894]  Warn them about globalism.
[01:26:55.934 --> 01:26:57.475]  Warn them about mercury in the shots.
[01:26:57.855 --> 01:26:59.916]  Warn them about the Iran war.
[01:27:00.316 --> 01:27:01.737]  Warn them about CPS.
[01:27:02.557 --> 01:27:03.358]  Help people.
[01:27:03.458 --> 01:27:06.479]  Spend your time warning and helping those that don't know.
[01:27:06.739 --> 01:27:08.080]  Do not defend me.
[01:27:08.340 --> 01:27:09.200]  Leave me behind.
[01:27:09.220 --> 01:27:12.622]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:27:15.507 --> 01:27:18.510]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:27:19.971 --> 01:27:21.632]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:27:21.932 --> 01:27:25.375]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:27:25.535 --> 01:27:27.377]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:27:27.997 --> 01:27:30.720]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:36.504]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:27:36.785 --> 01:27:40.688]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:27:41.008 --> 01:27:45.930]  In the Infowar, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[01:27:46.210 --> 01:27:48.971]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.
[01:27:49.251 --> 01:27:56.093]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded or streamed in super high quality directly to your computer or iPhone and shared with others.
[01:27:56.473 --> 01:28:02.295]  Thousands of special video reports, from tainted vaccines to martial law, can be found in this online video library.
[01:28:02.455 --> 01:28:06.997]  My weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[01:28:07.277 --> 01:28:09.458]  The Infowar is waiting for you to set...
[01:28:10.776 --> 01:28:19.911]  You're going to have your own environmental marker on your car, on your billfold, you know, in your ID cards for what your environmental footprint is.
[01:28:20.031 --> 01:28:21.534]  It's going to start with your cars.
[01:28:22.235 --> 01:28:23.257]  I've got that here in the stack.
[01:28:23.277 --> 01:28:24.238]  I'm going to get to that later.
[01:28:25.829 --> 01:28:29.370]  I wanted to play a minute or so of this CNN piece where they're announcing how great it is.
[01:28:30.111 --> 01:28:32.952]  Oh, there's some people that are imagining things.
[01:28:33.472 --> 01:28:34.833]  There's all these rumors.
[01:28:35.313 --> 01:28:42.816]  Meanwhile, it's on 60 Minutes and everywhere they have microwave guns, sound cannons there, rubber bullets, $25 million spent per convention.
[01:28:43.596 --> 01:28:45.479]  But they come in and call them weapons.
[01:28:45.539 --> 01:28:46.941]  They say they're going to use them on them.
[01:28:47.342 --> 01:28:56.956]  Then they use an emotional, cognitive dissonance trigger and say, some of the crazy people are saying that it's secret and that there might be weapons.
[01:28:57.813 --> 01:28:59.634]  But now let us show you the weapons.
[01:29:00.174 --> 01:29:06.617]  I mean, a total propaganda piece with the reporters reporting on it like they're talking about some fun water park or something.
[01:29:07.238 --> 01:29:10.840]  Oh, in Darth Vader outfits with microwave weapons.
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:14.681]  It's going to be there, but some believe it's going to be there.
[01:29:15.142 --> 01:29:17.643]  See, all just indoctrinating you in mental illness.
[01:29:18.043 --> 01:29:19.004]  Let's go ahead and play this.
[01:29:20.069 --> 01:29:22.790]  Pepperball rifles, Goo Guns, and Sonic Rays.
[01:29:22.870 --> 01:29:25.591]  Some of them are just wild rumors, but some may not be.
[01:29:25.731 --> 01:29:29.452]  Some of those weapons might be used to protect our political conventions later on this year.
[01:29:30.032 --> 01:29:33.673]  At Lavenderia is at the convention site in Denver where the Democrats are going to meet.
[01:29:33.713 --> 01:29:34.553]  See, hit pause.
[01:29:34.913 --> 01:29:37.494]  Some of those weapons, now it's not non-lethal, it's...
[01:29:37.814 --> 01:29:38.334]  Weapons!
[01:29:38.354 --> 01:29:43.797]  See, they were meant to train, to see images of men in black shooting at people, flame shooting out of guns.
[01:29:43.837 --> 01:29:58.964]  The Army said 20 years ago, then they'll upgrade to rubber bullets, harder bullets that kill a lot of people, there'll be deaths, they're going to have provocateurs that will attack peaceful people, the news will be part of the cover-up, show the cops dressed up and say they're real anarchists.
[01:29:59.345 --> 01:30:01.045]  We're going to expose these little bastards.
[01:30:01.305 --> 01:30:02.046]  Let's go back to it.
[01:30:04.019 --> 01:30:09.682]  John and Kieran, to prepare for this summer's political conventions, Congress is giving the host cities, Denver and St.
[01:30:09.702 --> 01:30:13.445]  Paul, Minnesota, $50 million each to pay for security expenses.
[01:30:13.505 --> 01:30:14.665]  Alright, stop it right there.
[01:30:14.926 --> 01:30:16.286]  Congress doesn't give money.
[01:30:16.507 --> 01:30:17.967]  They take our money locally.
[01:30:17.987 --> 01:30:18.968]  I hear idiots every
[01:30:18.968 --> 01:30:30.994]  Every day they say it's free money, and then they send federal control in, and with this federal money Delta Force in 99 commanded the anarchists, that came out in the mainstream news, and staged them rioting so they could attack the peaceful people.
[01:30:31.274 --> 01:30:33.275]  They are traitors and enemies of America.
[01:30:33.595 --> 01:30:36.777]  They are trying to destroy our democratic process and our first amendment.
[01:30:36.977 --> 01:30:38.258]  They are guilty of treason!
[01:30:38.478 --> 01:30:39.278]  Back to the clip!
[01:30:40.319 --> 01:30:44.441]  But what exactly that money is being spent on is top secret here in Denver.
[01:30:45.635 --> 01:30:46.695]  Oh, stop right there.
[01:30:46.996 --> 01:30:47.676]  Back it up again.
[01:30:47.756 --> 01:30:49.096]  See, it's top secret.
[01:30:49.477 --> 01:30:54.418]  Oh, there's wild rumors about this, but we do have these weapons, but it's top secret, and the feds run it.
[01:30:54.779 --> 01:30:55.999]  See, everything's top secret.
[01:30:56.019 --> 01:31:00.121]  Your local cops are now top secret, and the preacher's spying on you.
[01:31:00.421 --> 01:31:05.623]  Top secret, with these criminal, drug-dealing murderers that run our government, running all of this.
[01:31:05.703 --> 01:31:06.203]  Back to it.
[01:31:06.223 --> 01:31:08.264]  It is top secret here in Denver.
[01:31:09.832 --> 01:31:13.134]  25 million dollars buys a lot of very interesting things.
[01:31:13.594 --> 01:31:19.037]  Bob Newman is an anti-terrorism consultant helping some Denver companies prepare for the Democratic Convention.
[01:31:19.518 --> 01:31:24.480]  He's anxious to see what kind of crowd control weaponry authorities will deploy for the convention.
[01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:24.900]  Authorities?
[01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:27.062]  There are also these crazy rumors going around.
[01:31:27.822 --> 01:31:29.042]  Stop right there.
[01:31:29.282 --> 01:31:30.563]  Notice how it's all scripted.
[01:31:30.583 --> 01:31:32.423]  They first have the anchor say, crazy rumors.
[01:31:32.723 --> 01:31:33.923]  They cut to him, crazy rumors.
[01:31:34.163 --> 01:31:35.924]  But he's fighting terror.
[01:31:36.484 --> 01:31:38.644]  The protesters are terrorists.
[01:31:38.684 --> 01:31:38.904]  See?
[01:31:39.164 --> 01:31:40.105]  And it goes on and on.
[01:31:40.325 --> 01:31:41.065]  All woven.
[01:31:41.365 --> 01:31:42.285]  All crafted.
[01:31:43.225 --> 01:31:45.146]  All baseline propaganda.
[01:31:45.426 --> 01:31:46.806]  And just defenseless public.
[01:31:47.146 --> 01:31:55.508]  You know, those that haven't tuned out of mainstream news are just like... And then they'll see if the feds decide to spring it if we don't counter their black op.
[01:31:56.468 --> 01:32:07.932]  They will have their cops out leading little terrorist squads, and you'll find out the anarchists are really communists, most of them, that are with the cops, and they'll tell you point blank, they'll go, I'm gonna kill you someday, Jones, you're damn right, we're cops.
[01:32:08.392 --> 01:32:09.813]  I work for them and we're taking over.
[01:32:10.273 --> 01:32:13.054]  The state needs to rise and we're here to make sure it does.
[01:32:13.274 --> 01:32:14.594]  Then later, down with the state!
[01:32:14.614 --> 01:32:15.335]  Down with the state!
[01:32:15.555 --> 01:32:16.515]  Then they're total statists.
[01:32:16.535 --> 01:32:22.476]  I mean, I've had them in Austin death-threaten me, sitting there getting black-op orders from the cops, with feds overhanging us.
[01:32:22.497 --> 01:32:25.097]  You know what it's like to know the police are terrorists?
[01:32:25.477 --> 01:32:28.478]  You know what it's like to have them come up and say they're going to plant bombs on you?
[01:32:28.678 --> 01:32:32.899]  You know what it's like to know these bastard anarchist leaders are scumbag feds?
[01:32:33.419 --> 01:32:38.361]  You know what it's like to know they're out there doing this so they can shut down our free speech?
[01:32:39.375 --> 01:32:43.158]  And I'm going to Denver, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm going to cover what's going on there.
[01:32:43.398 --> 01:32:44.819]  You can be assured of that.
[01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:48.302]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is coming up next.
[01:32:48.682 --> 01:32:49.723]  Strap yourselves in.
[01:32:49.743 --> 01:32:52.846]  He's guaranteed to be locked and loaded in the Infowar.
[01:32:52.866 --> 01:32:54.207]  PrisonPlanet.com!
[01:32:59.184 --> 01:33:04.945]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[01:33:05.265 --> 01:33:10.806]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high-stress lifestyle.
[01:33:11.647 --> 01:33:15.467]  And I'm going to Denver, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm gonna cover what's going on there.
[01:33:15.687 --> 01:33:17.148]  You can be assured of that.
[01:33:18.448 --> 01:33:20.608]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is coming up next.
[01:33:20.949 --> 01:33:21.969]  Strap yourselves in.
[01:33:22.029 --> 01:33:25.189]  He's guaranteed to be locked and loaded in the Info War.
[01:33:25.389 --> 01:33:26.530]  PrisonPlanet.com!
[01:33:31.405 --> 01:33:37.127]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[01:33:37.487 --> 01:33:43.090]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high-stress lifestyles.
[01:33:43.430 --> 01:33:47.271]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[01:33:47.572 --> 01:33:52.514]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.

[01:35:30.528 --> 01:35:35.972]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[01:35:36.253 --> 01:35:37.493]  And we knew what to do.
[01:35:37.574 --> 01:35:39.315]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:35:39.575 --> 01:35:45.980]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:46.961]  Whitman
[01:35:48.295 --> 01:35:55.117]  The EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:35:55.497 --> 01:35:57.917]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11.
[01:35:58.938 --> 01:36:04.979]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:36:05.579 --> 01:36:08.620]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:36:09.060 --> 01:36:11.181]  There is a war on for your mind.
[01:36:11.621 --> 01:36:16.442]  You have found it, the tip of the spear, the very front lines in the fight against the globalists.
[01:36:17.162 --> 01:36:35.169]  And their crime syndicate that has destroyed the name of our country, destroying our currency, setting up an unmitigated police state, and preparing a heinous, Hitlerian-style attack on the Iranians that even mainstream media and brokerage houses are saying will triple energy prices for the time.
[01:36:36.089 --> 01:36:38.971]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joins us for the next 30 minutes or so.
[01:36:40.231 --> 01:36:47.798]  And we're going to talk about the Iran situation, the neocons, what he thinks they're going to do, what's happening with the economy, the anthrax case.
[01:36:47.839 --> 01:36:51.062]  He's been writing a lot of great syndicated columns out there.
[01:36:51.082 --> 01:36:54.965]  He also, of course, has his second edition of his great book out.
[01:36:55.826 --> 01:36:57.988]  Well, Alex, I hardly know where to begin.
[01:36:58.048 --> 01:36:59.289]  You know, for some years I've been expressing
[01:37:24.997 --> 01:37:31.902]  The view that an attack on Iran was in the cards unless somebody was able to stop it.
[01:37:33.423 --> 01:37:40.648]  And it doesn't look like the Congress or the media are going to stop it.
[01:37:41.969 --> 01:37:47.873]  There's indications that the United States military is not very happy about it, except maybe for the Air Force.
[01:37:50.936 --> 01:37:54.118]  On the other hand, it seems at this point,
[01:37:55.792 --> 01:38:06.240]  To really be a reckless scheme, because so much has come out about the behavior of the Bush regime.
[01:38:08.422 --> 01:38:16.268]  The fact that we were completely deceived, that they lied about all the so-called evidence leading into Iraq.
[01:38:16.288 --> 01:38:20.711]  You know, we've had the book by the former White House press spokesman.
[01:38:20.751 --> 01:38:24.134]  We've had the Rockefeller Committee's reports.
[01:38:25.106 --> 01:38:33.551]  On how all the intelligence was misrepresented and fabricated by Bush and indeed every high official in his government.
[01:38:34.872 --> 01:38:53.804]  And so for them, in the face of all of this, in the face of European opposition, apparently even in the face of Arab opposition of our own puppet states like Saudi Arabia and Egypt,
[01:38:55.393 --> 01:39:24.840]  If they attack it, Iran, it will really be reckless and I would assume if they go ahead with such absence of support everywhere that they intend for the Iranian response to sink our aircraft carriers or do something dramatic that everybody gets so mad
[01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:26.440]  I think so.
[01:39:48.428 --> 01:40:00.397]  The damage that would be done would be small compared to the risk of the retaliation if they actually can close the Strait of Hormuz and stop oil flows.
[01:40:00.517 --> 01:40:05.581]  If they actually can sink those carriers, which apparently they can do.
[01:40:06.902 --> 01:40:15.148]  If they actually can hit the Idril itself with those longer range missiles.
[01:40:17.650 --> 01:40:31.922]  As the Arabs themselves predict, it would cause an uproar throughout the Middle East that maybe cause even the Milwaukee puppet regime in Iraq to turn against us.
[01:40:32.102 --> 01:40:37.347]  And they're also, Iran has said they're going to attack with a Blitzkrieg military-style attack into Iraq.
[01:40:38.087 --> 01:40:44.052]  They've said they're going to block the strait there with a bunch of sunken ships.
[01:40:45.093 --> 01:40:58.426]  They're saying, and of course the military, let's get this on the record now, the Navy and Admiral Fallon and others have said they've been ordered to put the ships way, way too close to Iran and there's no reason to even do that.
[01:40:58.446 --> 01:41:03.852]  We're talking 20, 30 more minutes of flying time to make the aircraft carriers be safe.
[01:41:04.372 --> 01:41:27.366]  The Bush administration is knowingly sticking them right up there, inviting the Iranians to blow it to kingdom come, and a large segment of the population that is dim-witted, to say the least, psychologically scarred, will see that as an attack by Iran, when Iran has, under international law, the right to fight back and defend itself.
[01:41:27.966 --> 01:41:30.288]  And what concerns me, Dr. Roberts, I want to get your take on this.
[01:41:31.308 --> 01:41:39.456]  is, A, the ships, why they knowingly have them up so close under orders, and I mean, that's clear evidence of treason right there by the executive branch.
[01:41:40.497 --> 01:41:44.340]  But secondarily, I've seen Times of London and U.S.
[01:41:44.961 --> 01:41:48.424]  newspapers all saying they bought monkeys for bioweapons.
[01:41:48.444 --> 01:41:50.986]  You read the article, no evidence.
[01:41:51.026 --> 01:41:52.848]  They're making a nuclear bomb again.
[01:41:52.888 --> 01:41:53.869]  They've got one.
[01:41:54.890 --> 01:41:56.871]  I mean, just the same lies
[01:41:57.512 --> 01:42:00.233]  Well, that certainly seemed to be the case, and the only reason I can see they would
[01:42:26.553 --> 01:42:29.854]  Want to do all this would be so they could use nuclear weapons.
[01:42:29.954 --> 01:42:48.742]  You know, sometime back, I came to the conclusion, I don't remember if it was 06 or 07, that they had learned, the neoconservative Brownshirts and the Brownshirt Bush regime had learned that they cannot dominate the Middle East with conventional weapons.
[01:42:49.823 --> 01:42:55.045]  And so that they came to the conclusion that they would have to nuke
[01:42:55.922 --> 01:43:03.381]  The Muslims, because then the Muslims would realize that terrorism and guerrilla warfare, fourth generation warfare,
[01:43:04.415 --> 01:43:08.319]  is not an effective response to nuclear weapons.
[01:43:08.339 --> 01:43:12.603]  So, that's the conclusion the neocon grounds for.
[01:43:13.203 --> 01:43:23.292]  Exactly, but the analysts are saying it will turn the whole West, the whole world further against this, will cause domestic resistance, and I guess that's their excuse to crack down domestically.
[01:43:24.934 --> 01:43:26.895]  It appears then this is a going for broke.
[01:43:28.397 --> 01:43:30.719]  Well, it doesn't make any sense because
[01:43:31.718 --> 01:43:33.079]  We have nothing to gain by it.
[01:43:33.479 --> 01:43:35.900]  I mean, there's nothing that we gain by it.
[01:43:36.740 --> 01:43:41.262]  I'm absolutely convinced the Bush regime knows that Iran doesn't have any nuclear weapons.
[01:43:41.282 --> 01:43:45.324]  The International Atomic Energy Agency keeps telling them that over and over and over.
[01:43:46.224 --> 01:43:49.506]  Furthermore, it wouldn't make any difference if they had nuclear weapons.
[01:43:49.946 --> 01:43:57.909]  A lot of people have nuclear weapons that are far greater potential threats to the United States than Iran could ever be.
[01:43:58.630 --> 01:43:59.610]  Just China and Russia.
[01:44:01.045 --> 01:44:01.625]  Pakistan!
[01:44:02.506 --> 01:44:08.928]  Well, yes, but it's hard to imagine even Pakistan being a threat.
[01:44:09.068 --> 01:44:10.409]  No, I mean, I agree with you.
[01:44:10.449 --> 01:44:27.076]  China and Russia, I mean, and yet what we're doing provokes China and Russia because China relies, has huge energy investments in Iran and relies on that as a source of energy and any nuclear
[01:44:28.058 --> 01:44:32.419]  Fallout would probably spread over Russian territory.
[01:44:32.439 --> 01:44:34.700]  The whole thing is insane.
[01:44:34.780 --> 01:44:39.302]  And so, it makes, and there's nothing in it for us.
[01:44:39.362 --> 01:44:43.583]  It's not like we gain anything from doing this.
[01:44:43.643 --> 01:44:47.104]  And that's why it makes no sense to me.
[01:44:47.524 --> 01:44:50.865]  And I don't, there's not really any support for it.
[01:44:51.025 --> 01:44:53.086]  I mean, maybe some of the crazies in Congress,
[01:44:54.090 --> 01:45:05.335]  But I don't think it's such an isolated and evil act that it's hard to see what the advantage is.
[01:45:05.435 --> 01:45:11.057]  But torture is evil and there's no advantage unless it means terrorizing the people of the West, creating fear.
[01:45:11.077 --> 01:45:18.440]  Yeah, I agree with that, Alex, but the consequences of an individual case of torture is not the same as attacking Iran and provoking.
[01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:20.541]  Why did Hitler invade?
[01:45:20.561 --> 01:45:22.382]  And then going into a nuclear type
[01:45:24.615 --> 01:45:34.078]  You know, if we drop nuclear bombs on them, what's the... I mean, Japan, just think what it... reawakens in Japan, because we nuked two of their cities for no reason whatsoever.
[01:45:35.738 --> 01:45:40.019]  And basically they were war crimes directed against civilian population.
[01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:43.680]  It'll just reawaken them.
[01:45:43.700 --> 01:45:44.460]  That's the whole thing.
[01:45:44.500 --> 01:45:45.881]  And we're not strong.
[01:45:45.941 --> 01:45:47.341]  We're not... the dollars are weak.
[01:45:47.421 --> 01:45:50.022]  We depend on foreigners to finance us.
[01:45:50.646 --> 01:45:55.087]  Finance both our imports and the daily operations of the government.
[01:45:55.107 --> 01:45:56.607]  Well that's what Ron Paul says.
[01:45:56.667 --> 01:46:01.828]  He says that most assuredly this will accelerate the demise of the dollar if they attack.
[01:46:01.848 --> 01:46:02.348]  Do you agree?
[01:46:03.529 --> 01:46:05.369]  Oh yeah, sure.
[01:46:07.690 --> 01:46:11.770]  It'll leave us even more hated and isolated and there's no advantage.
[01:46:12.751 --> 01:46:19.312]  I mean, you'd have to be not only insane, but you'd have to have a moronic IQ.
[01:46:21.050 --> 01:46:21.792]  Do you?
[01:46:31.946 --> 01:46:35.508]  You know, Iran has not attacked anybody, and God knows when.
[01:46:36.088 --> 01:46:37.849]  And by the way, Doctor, that was my next question.
[01:46:37.929 --> 01:46:52.196]  As you know, for five years, Cy Hirsch has reported, the White House admits, they've got four different Wahhabist groups, which they have called Al-Qaeda, attacking Iran, blowing up school buses, mosques, and the Iranians are suing the U.S.
[01:46:52.337 --> 01:46:53.377]  for doing it, and the U.S.
[01:46:53.417 --> 01:46:54.318]  admits they're doing it.
[01:46:54.638 --> 01:47:00.641]  I mean, we're attacking them every week with terror attacks, and they're laying there taking it.
[01:47:02.233 --> 01:47:29.511]  Well, it's obvious that they don't want the conflict, and it's hard to see any reason for this, or anybody gaining from this, because the consequences for the United States are all so terribly adverse, and there's nothing good for us.
[01:47:31.469 --> 01:47:36.151]  So, I don't know that it can happen.
[01:47:36.971 --> 01:47:39.952]  You see, the Navy has to know those ships shouldn't be that close.
[01:47:39.972 --> 01:47:43.633]  And so if they lose them, the Navy's got to know what's happened.
[01:47:44.713 --> 01:47:55.456]  I don't know how much the idiot in the White House can demoralize the military and still have a military.
[01:47:57.557 --> 01:48:00.318]  No one supports the Bush regime.
[01:48:01.798 --> 01:48:03.279]  Uh, except Israel.
[01:48:04.319 --> 01:48:04.960]  No country.
[01:48:04.980 --> 01:48:16.625]  I mean, we buy leaders, and we buy them and get them to make these statements and all, but there's not any support for us, our attack on Iran.
[01:48:16.645 --> 01:48:23.728]  There's no support for our wars in Iraq, none for our wars in Afghanistan, none for our wars in Africa.
[01:48:25.549 --> 01:48:26.249]  I just don't know.
[01:48:28.050 --> 01:48:29.831]  Alex, I mean, maybe they want to use it to
[01:48:31.409 --> 01:48:38.731]  Clamp down here and have a police state and arrest you and me and a lot of other people to put in those Halliburtonville camps.
[01:48:38.891 --> 01:48:40.351]  Oh, I agree with you, Dr. Roberts.
[01:48:40.371 --> 01:48:41.232]  I mean, that's it.
[01:48:41.392 --> 01:48:55.535]  If you analyze it and you read their strategy of tension and you read their plan, what Bush calls Order Out of Chaos, it is just get us into an all-out economic collapse in the middle of a war so people will rally around the flag and the real target
[01:48:56.095 --> 01:48:58.357]  This is what Ray McGovern's finally saying.
[01:48:58.537 --> 01:48:59.838]  He's pretty much agreeing with me.
[01:48:59.918 --> 01:49:00.878]  I've been saying this for years.
[01:49:01.199 --> 01:49:08.144]  Ron Paul's saying it too, and I guess you're now saying that, that we're the real target in all of this so they can loot here.
[01:49:08.624 --> 01:49:13.888]  This is about them thinking that we will rally behind the flag if we see a smoking fleet
[01:49:14.588 --> 01:49:22.413]  Well, I've been writing about the police state like you've been talking about it and I can't dispute that we might be running that type of risk.
[01:49:22.473 --> 01:49:22.973]  I'm not sure
[01:49:43.689 --> 01:50:00.196]  How the population will take it and I'm not sure either how the United States government would be able to finance its operations under such circumstances.
[01:50:00.728 --> 01:50:01.869]  Well that was my next question.
[01:50:02.429 --> 01:50:12.754]  I've analyzed it, not that I'm some expert, but I've talked to other experts who have been involved in this in third world countries, running these operations, and they say that it isn't going to work.
[01:50:13.954 --> 01:50:23.059]  That maybe in a place where there's already warlords, they can pay off different ones to fight with each other and control factions that way, but they're saying the way the U.S.
[01:50:23.099 --> 01:50:23.759]  has laid out
[01:50:24.259 --> 01:50:29.882]  That if they're really planning to go into a hot type of martial law, that the central government is going to collapse.
[01:50:29.942 --> 01:50:31.363]  I mean, hell, I'm sure you saw it today.
[01:50:31.723 --> 01:50:34.285]  Congress now has a 9% approval rating?
[01:50:36.066 --> 01:50:36.686]  Oh, is that low?
[01:50:36.726 --> 01:50:37.546]  Is it a single digit?
[01:50:39.127 --> 01:50:40.768]  Well, yes.
[01:50:41.428 --> 01:50:44.550]  And you know, too, that we don't have any troops.
[01:50:44.590 --> 01:50:47.452]  They're all in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[01:50:47.512 --> 01:50:49.173]  So, I don't know.
[01:50:50.753 --> 01:50:53.395]  Hell, the NRA outnumbers any
[01:50:54.577 --> 01:50:58.738]  Combined police force and troops that the bastards could muster.
[01:51:00.858 --> 01:51:04.819]  So I don't know how quietly people would go.
[01:51:04.839 --> 01:51:10.100]  I don't know if they have the capability.
[01:51:10.540 --> 01:51:21.043]  I think what they're more likely to do is get us cut off from fuel, from energy, from food, from financing.
[01:51:23.951 --> 01:51:34.921]  And have all kinds of rioting and outbreaks that would be more aggressive and more violent than any we had seen in the past.
[01:51:36.063 --> 01:51:39.165]  I think people are fed up with the police.
[01:51:39.205 --> 01:51:46.973]  They hate them because they've seen all their brutalities and the senseless taserings and the senseless arrests.
[01:51:48.835 --> 01:51:50.456]  I mean, Bush is certainly not loved.
[01:51:50.536 --> 01:51:55.359]  I just don't think anybody's going to rally around Bush.
[01:51:55.379 --> 01:51:57.721]  But they might around a new puppet like Obama.
[01:51:59.402 --> 01:52:08.769]  Dr. Roberts, I want to, just out of the gates here, because we don't have much time left with you, I want to get your take on, we've got Obama, we've got McCain,
[01:52:10.010 --> 01:52:12.913]  I mean, we know Obama's bought and paid for by some of the same interests.
[01:52:12.953 --> 01:52:14.054]  We know what McCain wants.
[01:52:14.114 --> 01:52:14.875]  Bomb, bomb, bomb.
[01:52:15.335 --> 01:52:16.456]  Bomb, bomb, Iran.
[01:52:16.476 --> 01:52:20.600]  I have the Ross Mucin reports, respected polls.
[01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:25.684]  The percentage of voters who give Congress good or excellent ratings has fallen to the single digits for the first time.
[01:52:26.385 --> 01:52:27.005]  Well, no, we're good.
[01:52:54.689 --> 01:53:07.138]  I agree with you on that, and I think we could possibly have a little hope at least that things will slow down in the directions in which they're going.
[01:53:07.158 --> 01:53:22.288]  You know, Obama, he probably will talk a bit different, and just the fact that he talks different gives more cover to the cowards in Congress, especially among the Democrats.
[01:53:25.639 --> 01:53:36.328]  You could actually see a substantial change in behavior in Washington.
[01:53:37.429 --> 01:53:49.920]  As long as the President is talking war, war, terrorists, blah, blah, it's hard for people in Congress to get on the wrong side of that.
[01:53:50.742 --> 01:53:51.062]  I think so.
[01:54:06.619 --> 01:54:09.541]  Attitude on the part of the Democrats in Congress.
[01:54:09.601 --> 01:54:11.162]  I wouldn't completely dismiss that.
[01:54:11.222 --> 01:54:12.904]  I wouldn't bet my life on it or anything.
[01:54:12.924 --> 01:54:13.564]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:54:13.584 --> 01:54:19.888]  The problem is Bush is saying he wants to attack Iran before Obama gets in or before McCain gets in.
[01:54:19.908 --> 01:54:21.389]  We've only got a few minutes left.
[01:54:21.409 --> 01:54:23.911]  I also want to plug the book before you leave, Dr. Roberts.
[01:54:23.931 --> 01:54:24.812]  We appreciate your time.
[01:54:25.472 --> 01:54:26.113]  The Economy.
[01:54:26.573 --> 01:54:28.354]  I mean, you're an economist, a top economist.
[01:54:28.394 --> 01:54:29.534]  Where do you see it going?
[01:54:29.574 --> 01:54:33.435]  It looks like things are deteriorating faster than we had hoped.
[01:54:33.455 --> 01:54:39.177]  We wish they would stop and reverse, but we had forecast, many had forecast, a few years for this to play out.
[01:54:39.817 --> 01:54:41.797]  Does it look like it's worsening quicker than you thought?
[01:54:46.039 --> 01:54:47.959]  No, I wouldn't say it's quicker than I thought.
[01:54:47.999 --> 01:54:49.300]  There's several things happening.
[01:54:49.320 --> 01:54:53.881]  As you know, we have this recession that's induced by the
[01:54:54.902 --> 01:55:23.924]  uh... inability to keep the economy going any further on the build-up of debt and uh... uh... and but but that's not the main problem the main problem is we have destroyed the uh... uh... the infrastructure that produced good jobs for americans and no more good jobs they're off shored I saw the other day where all the automobile producers were closing their design studios in
[01:55:24.662 --> 01:55:26.943]  California, they're all now offshore as well.
[01:55:27.623 --> 01:55:31.965]  When you lose manufacturing, you lose research, development, design, you lose everything.
[01:55:32.005 --> 01:55:37.568]  So all of the kind of jobs that we had people go to universities to do, they're gone.
[01:55:37.768 --> 01:55:41.350]  And so the economy can't recover from that.
[01:55:41.410 --> 01:55:50.614]  It's on its way to India of 20 years ago, where you have nothing but domestic service jobs.
[01:55:51.673 --> 01:56:00.101]  And you have lawyers driving cabs and engineers driving cabs and working as barmen and that type of thing.
[01:56:00.121 --> 01:56:10.812]  So I think they have pretty much ruined the outlook for Americans who used to
[01:56:12.134 --> 01:56:15.236]  Look to getting ahead in life, at least somewhat.
[01:56:15.316 --> 01:56:18.978]  But that sure makes it cheap for multinationals to come in and buy up what's left.
[01:56:19.418 --> 01:56:21.619]  In closing, is there any way to reverse this?
[01:56:23.621 --> 01:56:27.923]  Not with the kind of leadership that we have in Washington or produce.
[01:56:28.503 --> 01:56:33.306]  Not with the kind of disinformation that people continually fall for.
[01:56:34.967 --> 01:56:38.489]  So I think we're going to have some pretty rough times.
[01:56:41.252 --> 01:56:51.164]  As I say in this book of mine that's come out in the second edition, Tyranny of Good and Tensions, what we've really lost is the constitutional protections of our civil liberties.
[01:56:52.265 --> 01:56:57.411]  And this is far more deadly than the loss of jobs, the loss of the economy.
[01:56:58.012 --> 01:57:00.235]  We simply no longer have
[01:57:01.056 --> 01:57:04.499]  The protection of law.
[01:57:04.599 --> 01:57:05.820]  Law is now a weapon.
[01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:10.323]  Yeah, we can lose our factories and get them back and we have liberty.
[01:57:10.543 --> 01:57:13.105]  But when you don't have liberty, you're just another third world cesspit.
[01:57:13.705 --> 01:57:14.126]  That's right.
[01:57:14.326 --> 01:57:16.567]  And that's the greatest change.
[01:57:17.228 --> 01:57:23.452]  My book updates everything that's happened and has new chapters showing what Bush has added.
[01:57:23.512 --> 01:57:25.454]  And we simply no longer are free people.
[01:57:26.161 --> 01:57:30.522]  We think we are because the process of picking people up is random.
[01:57:30.582 --> 01:57:32.783]  It's not directed at all of us or the group.
[01:57:33.803 --> 01:57:35.684]  But we no longer protect it, Alex.
[01:57:37.704 --> 01:57:38.365]  Absolutely.
[01:57:38.405 --> 01:57:40.785]  Well, we appreciate you out there exposing it.
[01:57:40.865 --> 01:57:42.966]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, thank you for spending time with us.
[01:57:43.206 --> 01:57:44.726]  The book is The Tyranny of Good Intentions.
[01:57:44.766 --> 01:57:46.247]  Available in better bookstores everywhere.
[01:57:47.918 --> 01:57:49.199]  Sure Alex, I'd like to be on you.
[01:57:49.219 --> 01:57:49.920]  You're not intimidated.
[01:58:07.568 --> 01:58:14.731]  You go sometimes as far as anybody can imagine going, and I enjoy being with you because you're brave.
[01:58:14.871 --> 01:58:15.151]  So, Alex.
[01:58:15.171 --> 01:58:15.551]  Yeah, right.
[01:58:23.234 --> 01:58:24.596]  That may turn out to be the case.
[01:58:25.137 --> 01:58:26.018]  Yeah, unfortunately.
[01:58:26.158 --> 01:58:26.659]  Well, you know what?
[01:58:26.679 --> 01:58:27.940]  I think they're discredited though.
[01:58:27.960 --> 01:58:31.665]  And I really think they're getting shot down and I see a light.
[01:58:32.125 --> 01:58:36.551]  Now, we don't know if it's a train about to run over us or the end of the tunnel, but thanks to you and others.
[01:58:37.552 --> 01:58:44.378]  I don't... I mean, in a way, we can just hope we fall into a third world instead of total, glistening, slick fascism.
[01:58:44.398 --> 01:58:55.747]  I mean, I kind of just hope we collapse like the Soviet Union instead of, you know, morphing into something, you know, that is mechanized and focused and evil.
[01:58:55.807 --> 01:58:59.490]  I mean, I kind of now do finally in my life see a lesser of two evils.
[01:58:59.510 --> 01:59:01.612]  Do you... I mean, do you kind of get the point I'm making?
[01:59:02.072 --> 01:59:02.272]  Yeah.
[01:59:02.853 --> 01:59:05.955]  Alex, let me give you just one suggestion.
[01:59:06.335 --> 01:59:06.876]  You don't want to...
[01:59:07.799 --> 01:59:09.159]  We're good to go.
[01:59:30.380 --> 01:59:33.862]  Well, I agree with you, but I think you may be misinterpreting what I do here.
[01:59:34.343 --> 01:59:40.246]  I just cover the facts, and the fact is, the only hope we've got is to admit how bad it is and fight like hell.
[01:59:41.647 --> 01:59:43.107]  Because this is the fight of our lives.
[01:59:43.127 --> 01:59:46.789]  It's kind of like we're in a bulkhead with water coming in, and they're sitting around saying it's fine.
[01:59:46.809 --> 01:59:48.330]  I'm going, no, it's rising.
[01:59:48.370 --> 01:59:49.391]  We've got to get the hell out of here.
[01:59:49.911 --> 01:59:52.452]  That's exactly it.
[01:59:53.093 --> 01:59:53.653]  I agree with that.
[01:59:53.853 --> 01:59:56.915]  Well, we'll talk to you soon, sir, and hope you had a great Fourth of July.
[01:59:57.619 --> 01:59:58.242]  Okay, Alex.
[01:59:58.303 --> 01:59:59.047]  All the best to you.
[01:59:59.188 --> 01:59:59.670]  Thank you, Doc.
[02:00:00.374 --> 02:00:00.616]  Goodbye.
[02:00:00.797 --> 02:00:01.159]  Take care.
[02:00:02.952 --> 02:00:08.956]  Yeah, folks, I just meant to say bye to him there, and it turned into a whole... You get to see the behind the scenes.
[02:00:09.056 --> 02:00:10.116]  It's Red Level, folks.
[02:00:10.176 --> 02:00:18.121]  I mean, this is... I talk to congressmen, I talk to people like Dr. Roberts, I talk to foreign ministers, and they are all just... My God, what are we going to do?
[02:00:18.161 --> 02:00:19.322]  I mean, this is real, folks.
[02:00:19.382 --> 02:00:21.303]  This is... The New World Order's real.
[02:00:21.683 --> 02:00:23.084]  Their takeover's real.
[02:00:23.104 --> 02:00:27.707]  You know, the fact that they're dosing everything with their poisons is real.
[02:00:29.308 --> 02:00:30.068]  The fact that they're...
[02:00:31.189 --> 02:00:34.212]  I've seen Dr. Roberts come a long way, you know, years ago interviewing him.
[02:00:34.293 --> 02:00:35.434]  We've seen the full horror.
[02:00:35.474 --> 02:00:36.975]  I mean, it's hard to believe this stuff.
[02:00:37.516 --> 02:00:41.060]  It's hard to believe our government orders the military to rape children in front of their families.
[02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:43.042]  I mean, what in the world is going on here?
[02:00:45.779 --> 02:00:47.700]  And then I'm the radical because I'm against it.
[02:00:48.121 --> 02:00:51.023]  Okay, we're going to go back live now to the main transmission.
[02:00:51.463 --> 02:01:01.210]  And I want to, one more time for people, play the clip of Australian news with the attempted nerve gassing of their troops by their own government.
[02:01:01.530 --> 02:01:01.990]  Here we go.
[02:01:12.317 --> 02:01:13.198]  One thing's for sure.
[02:01:15.819 --> 02:01:17.880]  These are not boring times.
[02:01:18.640 --> 02:01:22.001]  These are the times that triumphed men's souls.
[02:01:23.261 --> 02:01:24.662]  It was the best of times.
[02:01:25.422 --> 02:01:28.283]  It was the worst of times in this tale of two cities.
[02:01:29.984 --> 02:01:31.984]  One, a shining light of liberty and freedom.
[02:01:32.784 --> 02:01:34.165]  The apple of the world's eye.
[02:01:35.505 --> 02:01:39.727]  But now its evil doppelganger is what we witness as this government today.
[02:01:41.287 --> 02:01:43.728]  The most wantonly evil government in history.
[02:01:45.083 --> 02:01:52.766]  The most premeditatedly wicked and conniving group of sinister forces we've ever seen.
[02:01:52.846 --> 02:01:53.766]  You are the target.
[02:01:54.167 --> 02:01:55.407]  You are the enemy of the New World Order.
[02:01:55.427 --> 02:02:02.510]  I want to play a bunch of clips now, but in the first hour, I played this clip from Australian newspaper, The Courier Mail.
[02:02:05.718 --> 02:02:10.845]  And this is how they wanted to nerve gas, with lethal nerve gas, 200 troops.
[02:02:10.905 --> 02:02:13.048]  They don't mention that in the U.S.
[02:02:13.128 --> 02:02:19.537]  and England, it killed the troops in some of the tests and others just, they died a week later, a month later, a year later.
[02:02:19.557 --> 02:02:21.660]  It was different dosages, thousands of tests.
[02:02:22.657 --> 02:02:25.918]  That they did it to subways, they did it to San Francisco, Houston, Texas.
[02:02:26.218 --> 02:02:30.379]  All of England was sprayed with biological, chemical, bubonic plague.
[02:02:30.399 --> 02:02:32.300]  I mean, you name it, folks.
[02:02:32.340 --> 02:02:34.960]  And they'd have troops, military doctors in the hospitals.
[02:02:36.361 --> 02:02:39.301]  But this is in Australian news where their government said no.
[02:02:40.782 --> 02:02:48.864]  Their government also said no in 1962 to grain shipments to Asia putting a hormone in it to sterilize the women.
[02:02:50.222 --> 02:02:51.443]  Now, I want to explain something.
[02:02:51.563 --> 02:02:52.843]  Our government did this here.
[02:02:52.903 --> 02:02:53.724]  They went ahead with it.
[02:02:54.384 --> 02:02:55.925]  Young man walks into the chamber.
[02:02:56.005 --> 02:02:56.585]  Nervegasm.
[02:02:57.045 --> 02:02:59.827]  And you tell veterans that, they'll say, you piece of trash.
[02:03:00.607 --> 02:03:03.008]  Back up right now or I'll knock your head off.
[02:03:03.048 --> 02:03:04.649]  You don't talk about my army!
[02:03:05.450 --> 02:03:06.090]  And I go, no, no, no.
[02:03:06.110 --> 02:03:06.750]  I have the articles.
[02:03:06.790 --> 02:03:07.491]  I have the documents.
[02:03:07.551 --> 02:03:08.511]  I have the congressional hearings.
[02:03:08.851 --> 02:03:09.392]  Shut up!
[02:03:09.412 --> 02:03:10.232]  I've never had this happen to me.
[02:03:10.572 --> 02:03:11.453]  Shut up!
[02:03:12.193 --> 02:03:14.054]  My government don't do it!
[02:03:14.724 --> 02:03:16.247]  And I'm like, yes, yes they do.
[02:03:16.687 --> 02:03:18.230]  Yeah, you just go ahead and make your threats.
[02:03:18.530 --> 02:03:19.472]  I will warn you.
[02:03:20.334 --> 02:03:21.415]  And it's just like a woman.
[02:03:21.435 --> 02:03:24.080]  This happened with John Wayne Gacy.
[02:03:24.100 --> 02:03:26.865]  You know, I've read quite a few books on criminology because they're so interesting.
[02:03:29.719 --> 02:03:30.460]  I don't read them anymore.
[02:03:30.480 --> 02:03:32.984]  It just upsets me too much the more I learn about evil.
[02:03:33.565 --> 02:03:39.033]  And this guy had 20, 30, I forget dead bodies of 10, 12, 13, 14 year old boys.
[02:03:39.634 --> 02:03:44.321]  He dressed up like a clown, lured them, killed them, tortured them, dressed up like a big fat demon clown.
[02:03:45.322 --> 02:03:46.182]  John Wayne Gacy.
[02:03:47.063 --> 02:03:54.325]  And his wife kept saying it stunk down there in the basement, but she was so blown away when she found out he was raping and torturing people to death.
[02:03:54.886 --> 02:03:56.486]  It's the same thing over and over again.
[02:03:56.986 --> 02:04:02.548]  If you'd have walked up to John Wayne Gacy, Miss Gacy, and said, Miss Gacy, he is killing people down there.
[02:04:02.588 --> 02:04:03.889]  He is torturing them for days.
[02:04:03.929 --> 02:04:04.769]  He is raping them.
[02:04:05.469 --> 02:04:07.670]  She'd say, get out of here, you piece of trash.
[02:04:07.710 --> 02:04:10.031]  How dare you say that to me?
[02:04:10.451 --> 02:04:12.152]  I'll knock your bloody teeth out.
[02:04:14.744 --> 02:04:15.105]  You see?
[02:04:17.508 --> 02:04:19.391]  But after it happened, she could admit it.
[02:04:19.752 --> 02:04:21.013]  I mean, I'm sorry, it's a fact!
[02:04:21.093 --> 02:04:22.395]  Our government kills our police!
[02:04:22.696 --> 02:04:24.038]  Our government kills our military!
[02:04:24.258 --> 02:04:25.320]  Our government kills us all!
[02:04:25.340 --> 02:04:28.404]  They're poisoning us in the shots, the air, the water, right now!
[02:04:29.815 --> 02:04:30.936]  I'm not your enemy, cops.
[02:04:30.996 --> 02:04:31.737]  I'm mad at you.
[02:04:32.038 --> 02:04:32.959]  Violating my rights.
[02:04:33.019 --> 02:04:33.679]  Being idiots.
[02:04:34.060 --> 02:04:35.061]  Being brainwashed.
[02:04:35.541 --> 02:04:36.182]  Incrementally.
[02:04:36.783 --> 02:04:38.424]  I wish you'd stand up for America.
[02:04:38.444 --> 02:04:39.486]  I know a lot of you want to.
[02:04:39.866 --> 02:04:41.207]  But you're scared and don't know how.
[02:04:41.508 --> 02:04:42.669]  Hell, I don't know how either.
[02:04:42.729 --> 02:04:43.790]  I'm just trying to expose it.
[02:04:43.810 --> 02:04:45.412]  People say, well, we want more solutions.
[02:04:45.672 --> 02:04:48.515]  My God, I can't even get the public to admit that we're under attack.
[02:04:49.136 --> 02:04:51.438]  No, that's the first part, is warning people.
[02:04:51.498 --> 02:04:59.063]  I'm like, on the parapet, dinging the bell, blowing the horn, and I'm going, enemies, they're at the gate.
[02:04:59.323 --> 02:05:00.784]  They're battering the gate.
[02:05:01.204 --> 02:05:08.829]  We got enemies inside the gate, trying to open the gate for them, and then the public's walking around in la-la land, and I mean, you know, telling me, well, we want solutions.
[02:05:09.089 --> 02:05:12.812]  Hell, man, it's not my job to give you solutions.
[02:05:12.832 --> 02:05:14.413]  You know what, we do try to give you a lot.
[02:05:14.833 --> 02:05:18.596]  We're just here letting you know, you know, hey, red alert, we're under attack.
[02:05:19.737 --> 02:05:20.737]  I've got another clip I've got to play.
[02:05:20.757 --> 02:05:21.398]  I've got to hurry now.
[02:05:21.458 --> 02:05:24.340]  Go ahead and play the 30-something second.
[02:05:25.101 --> 02:05:27.563]  And look how they whitewash it like it's no big deal.
[02:05:29.264 --> 02:05:32.086]  Do they tell you what the lethal nerve gas was going to do to them?
[02:05:32.106 --> 02:05:32.527]  Here it is.
[02:05:33.227 --> 02:05:34.348]  It's been revealed the U.S.
[02:05:34.408 --> 02:05:39.532]  military planned to test deadly nerve gas on Australian soldiers during the Cold War.
[02:05:40.092 --> 02:05:46.938]  Newly declassified files show that America was strongly pushing then Prime Minister Harold Holt to allow the tests.
[02:05:47.699 --> 02:05:51.140]  Is it your view that if Australia had got ahead with it, it was probably illegal?
[02:05:51.960 --> 02:05:55.021]  Oh, it was in international law terms, it certainly was.
[02:05:55.041 --> 02:05:56.522]  And that's why they were covering it up?
[02:05:56.962 --> 02:05:57.282]  Yes.
[02:05:58.382 --> 02:06:06.705]  The top secret plan involved allowing 200 mainly Australian combat troops to be air-bombed and sprayed with the chemical weapons.
[02:06:08.065 --> 02:06:10.706]  And folks, they knew the atomic soldiers were all going to die.
[02:06:10.746 --> 02:06:12.507]  They knew the uranium miners were going to die.
[02:06:12.547 --> 02:06:16.728]  They took little babies and radiated thousands of them in the US.
[02:06:17.970 --> 02:06:20.531]  I mean, there's even photo and film footage of it.
[02:06:21.092 --> 02:06:22.973]  Stuff I wouldn't even put in Endgame.
[02:06:23.073 --> 02:06:26.935]  I'm not putting three-year-olds who've been radiated in my film.
[02:06:28.135 --> 02:06:29.656]  You think I exaggerate?
[02:06:30.056 --> 02:06:32.638]  I don't show you the dead children!
[02:06:35.199 --> 02:06:43.005]  But you need to go look it up yourself and look at them for yourself and then shut your mouth when you tell me I'm making stuff up.
[02:06:43.206 --> 02:06:46.108]  I'm going to tell you again, cops and military, you are hated.
[02:06:46.168 --> 02:06:48.870]  Henry Kissinger wrote a book calling you dumb animals.
[02:06:49.571 --> 02:06:50.051]  I don't do that.
[02:06:50.091 --> 02:06:52.633]  I tell you point blank to your face, you're being used.
[02:06:52.874 --> 02:06:54.835]  And I'm telling you there's dead bodies in that basement.
[02:06:55.095 --> 02:06:55.696]  I've seen them.
[02:06:56.056 --> 02:06:58.958]  You understand I've got the documents, the facts, the eyewitnesses.
[02:06:59.198 --> 02:07:02.701]  I have seen the dead bodies in John Wayne Gacy's basement.
[02:07:02.901 --> 02:07:04.562]  So don't you tell me they're not there!
[02:07:04.782 --> 02:07:10.887]  You go in there and you look for yourself and you look at those maggot-covered corpses instead of telling me I shouldn't get upset about it!
[02:07:11.167 --> 02:07:12.788]  I'm sick of you not listening to me!
[02:07:12.988 --> 02:07:14.029]  This isn't a joke!
[02:07:14.309 --> 02:07:16.170]  I'm not risking my life to play games!
[02:07:18.462 --> 02:07:27.108]  I want to play the Declaration of Independence, and it's got the actor introducing it, and I agree with him that it's the ideal that's so beautiful, that's inspired so many things.
[02:07:27.508 --> 02:07:29.490]  Let's go ahead and play it, and we'll come back and play the rest of it.
[02:07:29.510 --> 02:07:29.930]  Stay with us.
[02:07:31.371 --> 02:07:40.837]  A group of politicians from the 13 American colonies come together in this building, right here, to plot what turns out to be a revolution.
[02:07:42.158 --> 02:07:47.502]  A contentious Continental Congress needs to set forth some convincing reasons for declaring war.
[02:07:49.187 --> 02:07:54.709]  Congress turns to a brilliant 33-year-old aristocrat from Virginia, Thomas Jefferson.
[02:07:55.869 --> 02:08:06.453]  In a matter of days, the red-haired wonder writes one of the most celebrated manifestos for human freedom and self-government in the history of Western civilization.
[02:08:07.953 --> 02:08:15.236]  The Continental Congress authorizes Philadelphia printer John Dunlap to print 200 broadsides, poster-sized sheets.
[02:08:16.678 --> 02:08:24.083]  The document, unsigned, is then rushed to waiting horsemen who put it in their saddlebags and galloped throughout the colonies.
[02:08:25.564 --> 02:08:32.928]  See, if this Revolutionary War is to be won, thousands of farmers and tradesmen must be persuaded to take up arms and fight.
[02:08:34.069 --> 02:08:34.529]  And they do.
[02:08:36.310 --> 02:08:43.395]  Not many people realize it today, but scholars believe Jefferson intended for the Declaration to be performed and not just read.
[02:08:44.660 --> 02:08:50.865]  Its words and rhythms were written to be spoken in proud and defiant tones in grand public places.
[02:08:52.706 --> 02:08:57.470]  It's a safe bet that the Continental Congress never had in mind a performer like me.
[02:08:58.591 --> 02:09:00.652]  That is to say, a black man.
[02:09:02.073 --> 02:09:05.476]  Thomas Jefferson was not ignorant of the problem of slavery, of course.
[02:09:06.216 --> 02:09:08.358]  He called it a moral and political depravity.
[02:09:09.279 --> 02:09:13.602]  And in the original draft of the Declaration denounced the slave trade,
[02:09:14.401 --> 02:09:16.982]  As a cruel war against human nature itself.
[02:09:18.562 --> 02:09:22.523]  But Congress thought better of this particular item, and deleted it.
[02:09:24.003 --> 02:09:34.105]  In fact, there was no mention of slavery, or black people, or of women for that matter, in this preeminent statement on the equal rights of man.
[02:09:34.125 --> 02:09:40.226]  So it makes you wonder, how could a man who himself held slaves,
[02:09:41.104 --> 02:09:47.466]  Write with such incredible passion and eloquence about human liberation and the promise of a democratic republic.
[02:09:48.847 --> 02:09:53.909]  Why, some may ask, do I bring up such embarrassing truths on this glorious occasion?
[02:09:55.269 --> 02:09:55.769]  I answer.
[02:09:57.390 --> 02:10:08.054]  The real glory of the Declaration of Independence has been our nation's epic struggle throughout history to close the gap between the ideals of this remarkable document
[02:10:08.985 --> 02:10:11.988]  And the sometimes painful realities of American life.
[02:10:13.649 --> 02:10:22.437]  The Declaration symbolizes the birth of our nation, of course, but also the constant struggle to achieve its ideals.
[02:10:23.698 --> 02:10:24.098]  Consider.
[02:10:25.620 --> 02:10:29.803]  The words of this document inspired the French Revolution in 1789.
[02:10:31.565 --> 02:10:34.968]  200 years later, the revolt of Chinese students in Tiananmen Square.
[02:10:36.135 --> 02:10:41.717]  It inspired Abraham Lincoln to issue the Emancipation Proclamation, Martin Luther King Jr.
[02:10:41.778 --> 02:10:46.119]  to fight for civil rights, and women's suffragettes to fight for the vote.
[02:10:48.300 --> 02:10:56.864]  This business of fulfilling the Declaration of Independence is a difficult struggle, but it is also an ennobling struggle.
[02:10:58.485 --> 02:11:03.227]  Jefferson called the Declaration an expression of the American mind.
[02:11:04.776 --> 02:11:10.300]  It is why this nation is so great and why I am so proud to be an American.
[02:11:11.881 --> 02:11:18.645]  Here now are those sentiments as first expressed in this very place.
[02:11:21.727 --> 02:11:34.095]  When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth
[02:11:34.750 --> 02:11:40.695]  The separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitled them.
[02:11:41.115 --> 02:11:49.402]  A decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
[02:11:50.083 --> 02:12:02.593]  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:12:03.385 --> 02:12:10.747]  That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.
[02:12:11.307 --> 02:12:20.950]  That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government.
[02:12:21.450 --> 02:12:31.713]  Laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form as to them, shall seem most likely to affect their safety and happiness.
[02:12:32.475 --> 02:12:38.220]  Prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes.
[02:12:38.660 --> 02:12:50.070]  And accordingly, all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.
[02:12:50.731 --> 02:13:00.958]  But when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism.
[02:13:01.558 --> 02:13:02.359]  It is their right.
[02:13:02.799 --> 02:13:09.283]  It is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security.
[02:13:10.284 --> 02:13:20.551]  Such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government.
[02:13:21.272 --> 02:13:27.499]  The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations.
[02:13:28.266 --> 02:13:33.889]  All having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states.
[02:13:34.330 --> 02:13:38.692]  To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.
[02:13:39.232 --> 02:13:44.455]  He has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
[02:13:44.595 --> 02:13:52.360]  He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained.
[02:13:53.081 --> 02:13:56.804]  And when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
[02:13:57.065 --> 02:14:11.478]  He has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable only to tyrants.
[02:14:11.838 --> 02:14:24.830]  He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public records for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
[02:14:25.130 --> 02:14:31.756]  He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
[02:14:31.957 --> 02:14:37.562]  He has refused for a long time after such dissolutions to cause others to be elected.
[02:14:38.163 --> 02:14:45.189]  Whereby the legislative powers incapable of annihilation have returned to the people at large for their exercise.
[02:14:45.869 --> 02:14:53.375]  The state remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without and convulsions within.
[02:14:53.855 --> 02:14:56.838]  He has endeavored to prevent the population of these states.
[02:14:57.399 --> 02:15:08.651]  For that purpose, obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners, refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands.
[02:15:09.378 --> 02:15:16.667]  He has obstructed the administration of justice by refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers.
[02:15:17.228 --> 02:15:24.297]  He has made judges dependent on his will alone for the tenure of their offices and the amount and payment of their salaries.
[02:15:24.777 --> 02:15:31.858]  He has erected a multitude of new offices and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.
[02:15:32.078 --> 02:15:38.139]  He has kept among us in times of peace standing armies without the consent of our legislatures.
[02:15:38.599 --> 02:15:44.481]  He has effected to render the military independent of and superior to the civil power.
[02:15:44.821 --> 02:15:52.482]  He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution and unacknowledged by our laws.
[02:15:53.021 --> 02:15:56.802]  Giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation.
[02:15:57.402 --> 02:16:00.143]  For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us.
[02:16:00.363 --> 02:16:07.944]  For protecting them by a mock trial from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states.
[02:16:08.224 --> 02:16:11.225]  For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world.
[02:16:11.605 --> 02:16:14.666]  For imposing taxes on us without our consent.
[02:16:14.926 --> 02:16:18.826]  For depriving us in many cases of the benefits of trial by jury.
[02:16:19.307 --> 02:16:21.207]  For transporting us beyond seas.
[02:16:21.887 --> 02:16:23.768]  To be tried for pretended offenses.
[02:16:24.148 --> 02:16:28.129]  For abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighboring province.
[02:16:28.689 --> 02:16:41.593]  Establishing therein an arbitrary government and enlarging its boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies.
[02:16:42.108 --> 02:16:49.593]  For taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws, and altering fundamentally the forms of our governments.
[02:16:49.833 --> 02:16:58.819]  For suspending our own legislatures and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
[02:16:59.280 --> 02:17:05.764]  He has abdicated government here by declaring us out of his protection and waging war against us.
[02:17:06.144 --> 02:17:11.890]  He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
[02:17:12.271 --> 02:17:21.421]  He is, at this time, transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation, and tyranny.
[02:17:22.202 --> 02:17:24.985]  Already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy.
[02:17:25.505 --> 02:17:28.168]  Scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages.
[02:17:28.748 --> 02:17:31.631]  And totally unworthy of the head of a civilized nation.
[02:17:31.891 --> 02:17:36.195]  He has constrained our fellow citizens taken captive on the high seas.
[02:17:36.595 --> 02:17:38.317]  To bear arms against their country.
[02:17:38.858 --> 02:17:41.960]  To become the executioners of their friends and brethren.
[02:17:42.541 --> 02:17:44.643]  Or to fall themselves by their hands.
[02:17:45.043 --> 02:17:47.706]  He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us.
[02:17:48.326 --> 02:17:48.687]  In every stage,
[02:18:03.579 --> 02:18:06.241]  Alright, I'm surprised Hollywood left that part in.
[02:18:06.761 --> 02:18:07.642]  That's enough for now.
[02:18:07.702 --> 02:18:13.246]  I'm going to come back and play the rest on the other side, but yeah, they would grab people for the draft, okay?
[02:18:13.526 --> 02:18:21.452]  They would grab them out of the seaports and off the boats, and that's what the draft is, which are drafting soldiers that have already been in.
[02:18:22.072 --> 02:18:28.417]  And when you go through that, they're doing every single thing, asset forfeiture, seizure, grabbing people's goods, saying they were criminals.
[02:18:30.046 --> 02:18:33.889]  You know, swarms of new agents to eat out our substance.
[02:18:33.909 --> 02:18:38.093]  You know, these administrative offices.
[02:18:38.833 --> 02:18:39.994]  It's far worse now.
[02:18:40.014 --> 02:18:45.699]  It's just they were quite informed and educated and intelligent back then.
[02:18:45.739 --> 02:18:47.741]  They weren't having a diet of fluoride.
[02:18:48.261 --> 02:18:49.582]  We'll come back with the rest of it.
[02:18:49.602 --> 02:18:50.063]  Stay with us.
[02:19:00.643 --> 02:19:10.707]  Last month, Ready Reserve Foods stated that by fall, food would be in short supply and the government would be forced to impose controls on food and food distribution because of civil unrest and panic.
[02:19:11.648 --> 02:19:15.269]  Well, the floods in the heartland of America have all but assured this will happen.
[02:19:15.830 --> 02:19:21.832]  It is estimated that 5 million acres of farmland will not be producing over 700 million bushels of corn alone.
[02:19:22.652 --> 02:19:26.014]  If you have ever thought about storing food, now is the time to do so.
[02:19:26.963 --> 02:19:27.503]  We're good to go!
[02:19:57.660 --> 02:20:00.201]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[02:20:00.521 --> 02:20:01.801]  Loose Change Final Cut.

[02:22:50.120 --> 02:22:55.762]  You know, we've got a lot of great water filters, but there's a new system that you don't even need water supply to get water.
[02:22:56.482 --> 02:22:59.704]  And by new system, I've seen this for years in companies, read about it, heard about it.
[02:23:01.044 --> 02:23:04.005]  They're fans of the show and sent me one, I guess, four or five months ago.
[02:23:04.025 --> 02:23:05.526]  I never got around to getting them as a sponsor.
[02:23:05.906 --> 02:23:06.706]  Incredible stuff.
[02:23:06.766 --> 02:23:13.769]  It grabs the water out of the air, whole bunch of gallons a day, totally clean, goes through five filters, easy to clean the filters out.
[02:23:14.709 --> 02:23:20.095]  Uh, this will save you money in just about six months with what the average person buys with a bottle of water that can't be trusted.
[02:23:20.456 --> 02:23:22.638]  Takes it right out of the air, runs it through five filters.
[02:23:23.219 --> 02:23:24.920]  It is acolablue.com.

[02:23:54.717 --> 02:24:01.643]  Okay, I'm going to let the Declaration of Independence take us out, and as I said, retransmission starts at infowars.com.
[02:24:01.703 --> 02:24:05.065]  Totally jam-packed first, second, third, and as you know, into this fourth hour.
[02:24:05.105 --> 02:24:09.909]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, if you missed any of it, I want to thank all of you for spreading the word about the radio show.
[02:24:10.249 --> 02:24:12.231]  Here it is, the end of the Declaration of Independence.
[02:24:12.731 --> 02:24:14.392]  What really made this country so great?
[02:24:14.432 --> 02:24:15.052]  Are we perfect?
[02:24:15.092 --> 02:24:15.352]  No.
[02:24:15.672 --> 02:24:17.012]  But were we better than everybody else?
[02:24:17.092 --> 02:24:17.452]  Yes.
[02:24:17.792 --> 02:24:18.893]  Now we've become the worst.
[02:24:19.273 --> 02:24:20.233]  Kanae History Works.
[02:24:22.574 --> 02:24:30.996]  A prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
[02:24:31.556 --> 02:24:34.297]  Nor have we been wanting in attentions to our British brethren.
[02:24:34.992 --> 02:24:40.895]  We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.
[02:24:41.155 --> 02:24:44.776]  We have reminded them of the circumstances of our immigration and settlement here.
[02:24:45.097 --> 02:24:47.758]  We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity.
[02:24:48.118 --> 02:24:57.122]  And we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence.
[02:24:57.542 --> 02:25:01.444]  They too have been deft to the voice of justice and of consanguinity.
[02:25:02.364 --> 02:25:13.550]  We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace, friends.
[02:25:14.070 --> 02:25:21.034]  We, therefore, the representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress assembled,
[02:25:21.674 --> 02:25:40.593]  Appealing to the supreme judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do in the name and by authority of the good people of these colonies solemnly publish and declare that these united colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent states.
[02:25:41.061 --> 02:25:44.682]  That they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown.
[02:25:45.262 --> 02:25:52.225]  And that all political connection between them and the state of Great Britain is and ought to be totally dissolved.
[02:25:52.665 --> 02:26:02.328]  And that as free and independent states, they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce.
[02:26:02.668 --> 02:26:07.850]  And to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do.
[02:26:08.810 --> 02:26:10.571]  And for the support of this declaration,
[02:26:11.452 --> 02:26:29.897]  Absolutely beautiful, folks.
[02:26:29.917 --> 02:26:31.737]  That's all she wrote for this transmission.
[02:26:31.777 --> 02:26:32.978]  Great job, folks at Genesis.
[02:26:32.998 --> 02:26:34.198]  Great job to the crew down here.
[02:26:34.218 --> 02:26:36.318]  I want to thank all the sponsors, affiliates, and listeners.
[02:26:37.079 --> 02:26:38.139]  God bless you all.
[02:26:39.127 --> 02:26:40.430]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
