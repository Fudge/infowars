[00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.483]  The situation in Big Sur has been pretty tenuous.
[00:00:17.563 --> 00:00:28.051]  Everything from sheer concern of immediate threat from the fire to just hanging in there day to day, doing the best we can to prepare for the fire approaching.
[00:00:28.071 --> 00:00:31.094]  President Bush is in Japan for the upcoming G8 Summit.

[00:01:00.647 --> 00:01:01.768]  My mind was so worn out.
[00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:02.909]  I could not sleep at night.
[00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.130]  I felt self-conscious.
[00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.592]  Nobody knows what that flaking is.
[00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:06.533]  And people say, ew.
[00:01:06.713 --> 00:01:08.054]  It just made me feel like you're dirty.
[00:01:08.074 --> 00:01:09.135]  I don't want people knowing I have this.
[00:01:09.155 --> 00:01:09.716]  It's embarrassing.
[00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:11.037]  Of course I felt self-conscious.
[00:01:11.097 --> 00:01:12.358]  Not very attractive to look at.

[00:01:58.511 --> 00:02:07.458]  He flew his lawn chair rigged with helium-filled party balloons more than 200 miles across the Oregon High Desert to land in a farm field in Idaho.
[00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.182]  Couch shot some of the balloons with a BB gun to lower himself to the ground.
[00:02:12.362 --> 00:02:16.486]  I would say the best thing is just the peace, serenity of the trip.
[00:02:16.646 --> 00:02:17.627]  It's just so quiet.
[00:02:18.047 --> 00:02:20.489]  You know, there's no wind up there because I'm moving with the wind.

[00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.375]  We played a lot of times in a lot of important matches and this is one more.

[00:04:28.805 --> 00:04:34.887]  The group's chairman says the ads will feature veterans of the war, describing the accomplishments they've seen since the build-up began in 2007.

[00:06:36.803 --> 00:06:37.604]  Hello, my friends.
[00:06:37.624 --> 00:06:38.324]  We're live.
[00:06:38.384 --> 00:06:39.485]  It is July 6, 2008.
[00:06:39.545 --> 00:06:46.167]  We're going to be here for the next two hours, as I'm here every Sunday with this Sunday edition.
[00:06:46.187 --> 00:06:54.471]  We syndicate across the land on the MNFM dial, satellite, the internet, badinfowars.com, prisonplanet.com, and global shortwave.
[00:06:55.151 --> 00:07:05.515]  We have redesigned PrisonPlanet.com, but for those that like the old design of the site, we're updating that daily as well at Classic.PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:07:05.595 --> 00:07:12.558]  You can go to PrisonPlanet.com itself and click on the banner that says Classic Prison Planet and check out that site as well.
[00:07:12.618 --> 00:07:15.820]  My new film, Truth Rising, was released on July 4th.
[00:07:16.793 --> 00:07:21.339]  And we are getting emails pouring in, people saying it is our best work.
[00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:23.181]  More on that coming up later.
[00:07:23.862 --> 00:07:24.643]  Here's what I want to do.
[00:07:24.823 --> 00:07:27.366]  I have got five big stacks of important news.
[00:07:27.386 --> 00:07:30.489]  I'm going to mention some of that now and cover it throughout the next two hours.
[00:07:31.804 --> 00:07:35.967]  I want to take a lot of calls today, and that means have your question, your comment ready.
[00:07:35.987 --> 00:07:56.403]  If you have a question for me about the private Federal Reserve, or about why gas prices are up, or you disagree with something I've said, or you want to add something to a point I'm making, or you want to mention something that you saw on your local news that you think is important, or international news, it is just total free-for-all today, toll-free number to join us, 877-590-5525, 877-590-5525.
[00:08:02.758 --> 00:08:02.818]  5-5.
[00:08:02.838 --> 00:08:03.519]  2-5.
[00:08:03.959 --> 00:08:08.723]  Unlike fake, controlled, neocon, fake conservative shows that really aren't conservative.
[00:08:09.717 --> 00:08:13.278]  Or the establishment liberal programs, we don't screen your calls.
[00:08:13.798 --> 00:08:19.220]  We want to know your name, where you're calling from, and if you volunteer that you disagree, you go to the head of the line.
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:25.842]  In fact, that even trumps people that volunteer that they're first-time callers, and I try to go to them first as well.
[00:08:25.902 --> 00:08:35.625]  So 877-590-5525, or if you happen to be listening in Central Texas, to the station that we syndicate out of and a lot of people listen to us on, News Radio 590 KLBJ, it is 836-0590.
[00:08:39.626 --> 00:08:41.888]  Okay, here are the stacks of news I have.
[00:08:42.048 --> 00:08:43.629]  Let me just read you some of these headlines.
[00:08:44.349 --> 00:08:49.353]  High gas prices threaten to shut down rural towns USA today.
[00:08:50.293 --> 00:09:00.060]  And I have a lot of family that lives in the country, in East Texas, and I knew a year ago that it was really hurting a lot of local businesses and people that have to commute.
[00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:07.204]  A lot of people aren't going on vacations now, you know, working class folks, because of the gas prices.
[00:09:07.224 --> 00:09:08.125]  And that was a year ago
[00:09:08.607 --> 00:09:38.159]  it is crippling our society because like it or not we're a sprawling society we are distributed across the land more than say europe where they have these highly compact urban centers that we are a new world country and so uh... it's more spread out built around the automobile and i'm not tell you the gas prices are hurting every business out there not just people selling gas because it's costing everyone in the economy and they have less discretionary incomes we'll talk about that really big news i interviewed congressman ron paul thursday
[00:09:39.239 --> 00:09:43.062]  And it ended up getting picked up by some newspapers and other publications.
[00:09:43.542 --> 00:09:44.202]  I had no idea.
[00:09:44.242 --> 00:09:52.588]  I got back this afternoon, was checking the web and saw that his interview got some headlines with me Thursday, and it should have.
[00:09:52.948 --> 00:10:01.174]  Ron Paul, I hear members of Congress saying, if we could only nuke Iran, Congressman Warren's of imminent confrontation.
[00:10:01.714 --> 00:10:06.197]  So I want to go over that secondarily today and stress how serious that is.
[00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:19.446]  Also, stories like this one, London cops use knife crime as an excuse to conduct random searches that violate due process, that the British also have under Magna Carta, similar to our Fourth Amendment to the U.S.
[00:10:19.866 --> 00:10:21.247]  Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:10:22.467 --> 00:10:30.169]  Now, you can type in, Britain proposes registering knives, and they've been proposing registering knives.
[00:10:31.169 --> 00:10:33.370]  As if that's going to cut back on crime.
[00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:34.611]  You can't stop criminals.
[00:10:34.671 --> 00:10:36.712]  It only restricts good citizens.
[00:10:37.193 --> 00:10:43.116]  Speaking of violations of the Fourth Amendment, Texas lawyer takes on bloodthirsty cops from PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:10:43.617 --> 00:10:45.318]  The feds have federal grants out.
[00:10:45.878 --> 00:10:49.100]  In some areas they take blood without warrants, in others it's a kangaroo.
[00:10:50.217 --> 00:10:52.799]  I interviewed the head of the Texas Bar Association a few weeks ago about this.
[00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.862]  Clearly, these are kangaroo warrants.
[00:10:55.882 --> 00:11:00.405]  They're just blank check warrants, and they've been losing in court on this, but they don't care.
[00:11:01.006 --> 00:11:04.288]  But the problem is that police are sticking hemophiliacs.
[00:11:04.328 --> 00:11:07.231]  They start bleeding everywhere because they have thin blood.
[00:11:08.031 --> 00:11:12.135]  They're also trying to take blood from diabetics and then aren't able to get it.
[00:11:13.196 --> 00:11:15.397]  It's just a major threshold they're passing.
[00:11:15.838 --> 00:11:16.858]  Why do the feds want this?
[00:11:16.878 --> 00:11:18.440]  It's not about stopping drunk drivers, folks.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:24.201]  Prescription drugs kill 300,000 people, or more than 10 times what drunk drivers kill every year.
[00:11:24.221 --> 00:11:25.662]  Why aren't they talking about shutting that down?
[00:11:26.302 --> 00:11:28.182]  Also, you can't make this type of stuff up.
[00:11:28.823 --> 00:11:36.485]  News Channel 10, CBS, out of Amarillo, Texas, and I'm just going to play a few seconds of this.
[00:11:36.505 --> 00:11:37.885]  I'm not going to play the whole newscast.
[00:11:37.925 --> 00:11:41.526]  We've got links to their site up on PrisonPlanet.com if you want to watch it.
[00:11:42.026 --> 00:11:44.987]  But when I read headlines like this, I think some of you may not believe me.
[00:11:45.547 --> 00:11:46.928]  It's so incredible.
[00:11:47.228 --> 00:11:56.871]  So let's go ahead and just play 10 seconds of the FBI can investigate you without a warrant, without probable cause, without even thinking you've done anything wrong.
[00:11:56.911 --> 00:11:57.631]  Go ahead and play that.
[00:12:00.372 --> 00:12:03.954]  Oh, they put new password systems on the computers that relaunch every 10 seconds.
[00:12:04.014 --> 00:12:05.054]  Oh, we can't play it.
[00:12:05.094 --> 00:12:06.315]  We've got to start putting those on disk.
[00:12:06.355 --> 00:12:08.795]  We can't do this anymore because it's just these computers.
[00:12:08.855 --> 00:12:09.556]  Okay, here it is.
[00:12:10.036 --> 00:12:12.617]  Go ahead and roll it for people out there that are
[00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:21.004]  FBI agents could soon be allowed to investigate Americans without any evidence of wrongdoing according to the Justice Department.
[00:12:21.484 --> 00:12:27.513]  News Channel 10's Kristen Gilfuss joins us live in the studio with what FBI agents would be looking for.
[00:12:27.713 --> 00:12:28.074]  Kristen?
[00:12:29.235 --> 00:12:38.042]  Walt, Justice Department officials say FBI agents would rely on a terrorist profile that could single out Muslims, Arabs, or any other racial groups.
[00:12:38.103 --> 00:12:38.863]  Okay, that's enough.
[00:12:38.903 --> 00:12:40.445]  You can watch the rest of it.
[00:12:40.505 --> 00:12:42.006]  Now that's out of Amarillo, Texas.
[00:12:42.066 --> 00:12:44.588]  Now, you hear that and you think, thank God!
[00:12:45.689 --> 00:12:55.777]  We need to profile people because they search old ladies, they search and harass old men with oxygen tanks, going to World War II memorial events.
[00:12:55.837 --> 00:12:57.479]  I saw them harassing old Pearl Harbor
[00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:01.511]  That's about four years ago in a San Francisco airport when I was flying out.
[00:13:01.571 --> 00:13:07.672]  I saw them getting on planes to Hawaii and they were really going over people that were on walkers that look like they were on the edge of death.
[00:13:08.512 --> 00:13:09.853]  And people say it's just mindless.
[00:13:09.873 --> 00:13:11.033]  They treat us all like terrorists.
[00:13:11.073 --> 00:13:14.234]  Well, you've been trained now to live under that.
[00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:15.514]  It's been used as a pretext.
[00:13:16.454 --> 00:13:24.436]  But when you actually look at the profiling, federal marshals last year, in fact some senior ones with their union in the Denver Post first broke it.
[00:13:25.087 --> 00:13:31.908]  ...are ordered to put millions of Americans in these databases a year for ordering a vegetarian on an airplane.
[00:13:32.815 --> 00:13:36.456]  Or taking a photograph out the window of the plane, which I thought everybody does.
[00:13:37.236 --> 00:13:44.838]  Small children are put in terrorist databases for life, and now it's swollen to several million people in the terrorist database.
[00:13:45.678 --> 00:13:49.759]  You have all the major banks uploading your financial information, guilty until proven innocent.
[00:13:50.319 --> 00:13:58.381]  All of that violates the Fourth Amendment, and has nothing to do with, quote, keeping you safe from terrorism.
[00:13:58.928 --> 00:14:03.511]  They're using terrorism as a pretext to take our liberties and freedoms.
[00:14:03.951 --> 00:14:13.918]  Also, we have another little clip we'll play later, where Homeland Security is proposing that everyone who gets on an airplane be fitted with an electronic shock bracelet.
[00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:25.445]  Now, a company was proposing this a few years ago, but now Homeland Security says, yes, you'll all be guilty until proven innocent, and you will wear Taser bracelets on your arms.
[00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:27.330]  Which makes you all criminals.
[00:14:27.891 --> 00:14:29.251]  All guilty until proven innocent.
[00:14:30.071 --> 00:14:31.532]  I mean, that's something out of The Running Man.
[00:14:31.572 --> 00:14:35.153]  But even The Running Man, it was only prisoners that wore bracelets around their necks.
[00:14:35.613 --> 00:14:36.933]  Now it's going to be everybody.
[00:14:37.333 --> 00:14:47.776]  Just like in England, they're proposing making anyone who's even on probation have an implantable microchip sourced on that British Broadcasting Corporation, BBC.
[00:14:48.316 --> 00:14:55.238]  So, on this post-July 4th, as we're thinking about our liberties and freedoms,
[00:14:55.894 --> 00:14:59.937]  You know, I was visiting family around Buffalo, Texas.
[00:14:59.957 --> 00:15:01.899]  We went to a nearby rodeo in Teague, Texas.
[00:15:02.379 --> 00:15:04.241]  I love those amateur rodeos.
[00:15:04.741 --> 00:15:10.005]  I mean, sometimes it's a lot better than even the Star of Texas or some big professional one because it's brutal.
[00:15:10.465 --> 00:15:14.869]  The cow mugging, the cow milking, the roping, the bull riding, it was crazy.
[00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:17.291]  And when we get back, I'm going to briefly tell you
[00:15:18.146 --> 00:15:23.750]  Their idea of patriotism on July 5th, when I was there last night watching the rodeo with my children.
[00:15:24.471 --> 00:15:26.752]  And, I mean, it was like 10 minutes of indoctrination.
[00:15:27.393 --> 00:15:30.235]  But never anything about what this country stands for.
[00:15:30.635 --> 00:15:31.956]  That's what we fight and die for.
[00:15:32.296 --> 00:15:33.577]  And that's what's being destroyed.
[00:15:34.738 --> 00:15:42.704]  We'll be right back with your phone calls, a ton of other news, right here, on the Sunday edition.
[00:15:53.568 --> 00:15:54.188]  Question.
[00:15:54.389 --> 00:15:58.970]  Is the world getting better or vastly worse?
[00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:02.731]  The world economic collapse could come any day.
[00:16:03.611 --> 00:16:04.151]  Question.
[00:16:04.451 --> 00:16:08.032]  Are you prepared or are you ignoring the signs?
[00:16:09.733 --> 00:16:10.293]  Question.
[00:16:10.493 --> 00:16:14.074]  Do you have seven years of healthy food for your family?

[00:16:52.874 --> 00:16:53.514]  It's a fact.
[00:16:53.734 --> 00:17:01.216]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:17:01.336 --> 00:17:10.198]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[00:17:10.458 --> 00:17:21.000]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:27.322]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[00:17:27.542 --> 00:17:32.564]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[00:17:32.744 --> 00:17:37.226]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.

[00:18:53.752 --> 00:18:59.677]  Have you ever suffered from giardia, food poisoning, heavy metal poisoning, arthritis, fatigue, or high cholesterol?
[00:18:59.877 --> 00:19:06.043]  Maybe you're one of the 75 million Americans that the Center for Disease Control reports as suffering from internal parasites.

[00:19:55.532 --> 00:19:58.414]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:19:58.474 --> 00:20:05.839]  Home to hard-hitting talk radio.
[00:20:05.999 --> 00:20:07.320]  Okay, we're back live.
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:08.941]  So, it's the July 4th.
[00:20:08.961 --> 00:20:12.323]  I'm visiting family off in Northeast Texas.
[00:20:13.784 --> 00:20:17.746]  And last night, I took my children to a local rodeo.
[00:20:19.107 --> 00:20:20.428]  The Teague, Texas rodeo.
[00:20:20.508 --> 00:20:21.529]  It was their 79th year.
[00:20:22.129 --> 00:20:24.551]  Beautiful night sky out there, the moon.
[00:20:25.783 --> 00:20:55.198]  And for 10, maybe 15 minutes, I know more than 10 minutes, the announcer got up there and talked about how great America was in the red, white, and blue, and they played Johnny Cash, this old flag, and they rode, you know, had girls ride around with American flags, people on their hands, on their hearts for more than 10 minutes, and saying how great our troops are, and how they sacrifice everything, and that's what America's all about, is spreading our freedom in Iraq and everywhere else, and
[00:20:56.266 --> 00:21:01.828]  How we've got to support the president and how it's not good to ridicule and criticize the government.
[00:21:02.708 --> 00:21:07.090]  And it went on and on and on and on and on and on.
[00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:11.651]  And it looked like fascism to me.
[00:21:12.392 --> 00:21:16.373]  You see, the flag symbolizes, we're also on TV right now,
[00:21:17.874 --> 00:21:19.515]  Shooting for the local TV show here in Austin.
[00:21:19.755 --> 00:21:21.035]  I'm holding up the Bill of Rights.
[00:21:21.275 --> 00:21:23.076]  You see, it symbolizes these.
[00:21:23.576 --> 00:21:25.036]  And the Declaration of Independence.
[00:21:25.196 --> 00:21:27.757]  And that is about resistance to tyranny.
[00:21:28.517 --> 00:21:36.200]  And it's about defending hard-won basic freedoms that are innate to human beings who aren't in bondage.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:44.442]  And talking to people in the country, talking to family and others, they're all griping about why gas prices are up.
[00:21:45.214 --> 00:21:51.143]  but even when you tell them well it's because the government made the decision to devalue the dollar
[00:21:53.459 --> 00:21:54.620]  They just don't compute.
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:22:07.350]  Or when you explain to them that both parties are dissolving our borders publicly and bringing in the North American Union and overturning much of our Bill of Rights and Constitution, they just don't compute.
[00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:12.695]  To them, it's just, I just say I'm patriotic, I love the red, white, and blue, and that's the end of it.
[00:22:13.055 --> 00:22:16.858]  Well, I love the red, white, and blue more than most people.
[00:22:16.958 --> 00:22:20.821]  It's just I love it because I know what it symbolizes and what it means.
[00:22:20.861 --> 00:22:21.882]  In fact, they had a series
[00:22:22.581 --> 00:22:43.329]  of uh... short films they would show on newsreels before movies during world war two and it was why we fight those happen to be on youtube and google at least last time i checked i'd challenge everyone listening tonight ur on the podcast the next few days are only refit until i'm live tomorrow afternoon on the stream and info wars dot com
[00:22:44.426 --> 00:22:46.387]  I'm challenging you to write a note right now.
[00:22:46.407 --> 00:22:52.830]  You're driving in your 18-wheeler, you're out at a shindig and got the radio on, or you're at home listening, or you're doing gardening.
[00:22:53.531 --> 00:23:04.456]  Just please, if you've forgotten or nobody ever told you or you never researched what this country's about, go watch what the government, when it wasn't as corrupt and bad, put out about why we fight.
[00:23:05.805 --> 00:23:18.818]  And it's these short films about because other governments want to take your guns, because other governments want to take your property, because other governments spy on you without warrants, because other governments violate the will of the people.
[00:23:19.719 --> 00:23:22.181]  I mean, when you look at the fact that every major Gallup poll
[00:23:22.734 --> 00:23:25.776]  Some of the most scientific, but they all are 85 to 92 percent.
[00:23:26.136 --> 00:23:36.944]  But on average they're around 90 percent of Americans, including Hispanics, the vast majority of them, want to control our borders and slow down the legal and control the illegal immigration.
[00:23:38.025 --> 00:23:48.112]  But you notice both parties want open borders, push forward and act like you have got seven heads and are from Pluto if you want to control our borders.
[00:23:48.873 --> 00:23:52.235]  I mean there are 600 and something million people south of the border
[00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:57.513]  Who want to come here from Latin America and we can't allow that.
[00:23:57.553 --> 00:23:59.975]  Driving down the wages, bankrupting the welfare system.
[00:23:59.995 --> 00:24:05.939]  I hear this line about, well, the illegals, they pick the produce and you'll be paying $100 for a tomato.
[00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:06.240]  No.
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:17.588]  In fact, less than 10% of a crop, whether it's tomatoes or corn or even a watermelon, when you get it at the store, was paid to who even grew it.
[00:24:18.391 --> 00:24:21.353]  And less than half of that is the cost of whoever picked it.
[00:24:21.854 --> 00:24:25.817]  Picking the food is a microscopic amount of the cost.
[00:24:26.377 --> 00:24:28.659]  And the illegal aliens aren't taking the
[00:24:29.716 --> 00:24:37.479]  Crop jobs, it's driving down the wages in meat packing, in custodial services, in construction, the quality, it's all unraveling.
[00:24:37.499 --> 00:24:43.522]  And then while the man works, they have federal studies on this, most of the women are then on welfare under fake names.
[00:24:43.902 --> 00:24:56.167]  And so an illegal alien on average, and these are government's own numbers, Congressional Budget Office numbers, California's got the numbers, takes three times as much money in services as they generate for the economy.
[00:24:56.907 --> 00:24:57.587]  Three times!
[00:24:57.987 --> 00:24:59.308]  So I don't want to hear that anymore.
[00:24:59.896 --> 00:25:01.966]  Okay, also when we take on...
[00:25:03.323 --> 00:25:29.876]  as much as ten times a year what we did at the last peak of immigration the nineteen hundred about a hundred years ago these people are very early anti-american they are nationalistic and we want to wars with mexico and they teach him in their textbooks that we stole the southwest texas oklahoma all the way out to california into oregon and they're taught to hate this country now i am not going to sit here and play along with this huge fraud
[00:25:30.712 --> 00:25:42.558]  And just have somebody flap an American flag in my face and tell me that America is about flying 8,000 miles away and blowing the living daylights out of Iraqis that did nothing to us.
[00:25:44.859 --> 00:25:47.101]  Our country is falling apart right now.
[00:25:47.241 --> 00:25:50.482]  Our country is literally disintegrating into third world.
[00:25:50.502 --> 00:25:51.523]  Do you know what it means?
[00:25:52.363 --> 00:25:58.506]  The peso has been, I looked it up last night, has been as much as 50 to 1.
[00:26:00.106 --> 00:26:01.748]  It was 30 to 1 in the late 80s.
[00:26:02.909 --> 00:26:04.790]  For much of its history, it's been about 12.5 to 1.
[00:26:05.331 --> 00:26:07.573]  Guess what the peso is versus the dollar right now?
[00:26:08.554 --> 00:26:09.014]  5 to 1.
[00:26:09.355 --> 00:26:11.016]  The peso is nearing parity.
[00:26:11.096 --> 00:26:12.477]  The dollar is dropping.
[00:26:13.619 --> 00:26:16.841]  The dollar has dropped so much that it's almost lined up with the peso.
[00:26:17.922 --> 00:26:20.765]  Now, the United States, in its 235 years, has never had a currency devaluation.
[00:26:25.518 --> 00:26:28.102]  These wrecked countries generally for good.
[00:26:28.523 --> 00:26:31.788]  A currency devaluation wrecked the Roman Empire.
[00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:35.915]  Hundreds of years into its Republic.
[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:54.312]  So, again, I love this country so I will come on air and instead of giving you a bunch of fluff and stuff that feels good and playing, I'm proud to be an American where at least I know I'm free and I'll gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today.
[00:26:54.872 --> 00:26:56.193]  Well, what does that mean?
[00:26:56.613 --> 00:26:58.595]  Because there ain't no doubt I love this land.
[00:26:58.635 --> 00:27:00.296]  God bless the USA.
[00:27:02.097 --> 00:27:02.938]  My family lives here.
[00:27:02.978 --> 00:27:03.638]  My roots are here.
[00:27:03.698 --> 00:27:04.799]  I'm dedicated to Texas.
[00:27:04.839 --> 00:27:06.100]  I'm dedicated to the United States.
[00:27:07.463 --> 00:27:13.833]  I can't even help myself, even though they were using it for propaganda purposes and expropriating it, meaning, well, they weren't doing it in an evil way.
[00:27:14.134 --> 00:27:14.855]  They're co-opted.
[00:27:15.416 --> 00:27:18.441]  But I still get a little tear in my eye during the Star Spangled Banner.
[00:27:19.401 --> 00:27:23.164]  Even though I knew it was being expropriated and being used by the New World Order.
[00:27:23.184 --> 00:27:26.267]  And our flag now, worldwide, is a symbol of evil.
[00:27:26.527 --> 00:27:31.411]  And the globalists have seized our country with corporate donations and control and think tanks.
[00:27:31.891 --> 00:27:36.875]  And they have now used us as an engine of terrorism, corruption, murders, payoffs.
[00:27:37.095 --> 00:27:38.616]  The whole world knows about it.
[00:27:40.177 --> 00:27:44.401]  And so the globalists have used our credit to buy up the planet, to buy off nations.
[00:27:45.296 --> 00:27:49.000]  The global corporations have used corporate welfare to fund themselves.
[00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:50.161]  They've now moved offshore.
[00:27:50.481 --> 00:27:51.843]  Halliburton, all of them.
[00:27:52.163 --> 00:27:53.264]  They're all moved offshore.
[00:27:53.725 --> 00:27:54.846]  Literally, almost all of them.
[00:27:55.246 --> 00:28:04.536]  And then they still prance around saying they're pro-US when they've left the country and set up policies that devalued our dollar and robbed what's in your bank account.
[00:28:05.757 --> 00:28:06.498]  So, we get back.
[00:28:07.679 --> 00:28:15.433]  Tyler, Gary, Charles, Matt, Heidi, Ed, Don, I'm going straight to your calls and later I'm going to read through the first
[00:28:16.733 --> 00:28:18.815]  Ten amendments to the Bill of Rights.
[00:28:19.595 --> 00:28:27.041]  I am going to read through the First Amendment to the Tenth Amendment, and we are going to ask ourselves, is this what is happening in our country?
[00:28:27.141 --> 00:28:30.444]  Is the government destroying this, or are they defending this?
[00:28:30.924 --> 00:28:35.287]  Because the Founding Fathers said, anybody that attacks those amendments is traitors.
[00:28:35.768 --> 00:28:38.850]  And it's not your right to resist them, it is your duty.
[00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:41.612]  So we are resisting them in the Info War.
[00:28:41.832 --> 00:28:42.633]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:54.685 --> 00:28:58.867]  Would you like to know how you can use water as fuel and laugh at the rising price of gas?
[00:28:59.087 --> 00:29:01.048]  Then keep listening for a very special offer.

[00:31:53.308 --> 00:31:59.052]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[00:31:59.392 --> 00:32:05.016]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high-stress lifestyles.
[00:32:05.336 --> 00:32:09.199]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[00:32:09.499 --> 00:32:12.861]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking
[00:32:13.061 --> 00:32:14.402]  alkaline ionized water.

[00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:18.087]  We're back live, my friends, and we're here discussing what makes the United States special.
[00:33:18.889 --> 00:33:20.391]  Why do we celebrate the Fourth of July?
[00:33:20.411 --> 00:33:26.661]  I mean, is it just worshiping the flag, or does that flag symbolize something?
[00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:35.083]  When you find out what that flag symbolizes, liberties and freedoms that people fought and died for, then you find out they're being systematically removed.
[00:33:35.683 --> 00:33:47.549]  I was going to go to Tyler because he's first in line from British Columbia, but we'll go to him second because Don in Texas says he disagrees, and people that disagree go to the head of the line.
[00:33:47.589 --> 00:33:48.649]  You're on the air.
[00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:49.530]  Welcome, Don.
[00:33:50.419 --> 00:33:51.299]  Howdy, Alex.
[00:33:51.319 --> 00:34:03.204]  I wanted to let you know I agree with you on 99% of what you say, but you made a point a few days ago regarding the storage of precious metals that I disagree with.
[00:34:04.566 --> 00:34:22.202]  And that you recommended the use of a safe deposit box and that's the worst place you can put it because when the administration declares a national emergency they're going to require a federal agent to be present when you get into your safe deposit box.
[00:34:22.582 --> 00:34:24.284]  Well let me just add that
[00:34:25.104 --> 00:34:48.224]  I probably was speaking so fast, like when I get excited, and I was saying, spread it out, and I was saying, maybe something in a safety deposit box, you know, part of your metals, somewhere else, because just like with the Great Depression, there are thousands of times, paper, false assets, garbage assets that have been AAA rated, and now that's what's causing the real
[00:34:49.984 --> 00:34:57.106]  Crisis, not just in the housing markets, but as you know, with the global economy, not just US markets.
[00:34:57.646 --> 00:34:58.726]  And so you're absolutely right.
[00:34:58.766 --> 00:35:11.048]  In fact, governments have now, from San Francisco to Dallas, Texas, I've seen it in the last few months, England as well, are just randomly going into banks and saying, we're going to search a thousand safety deposit boxes.
[00:35:11.148 --> 00:35:13.949]  And now in California, they have been seizing
[00:35:14.773 --> 00:35:21.095]  Safety deposit boxes, there's even been some national news pieces on this, and for quote, the state's debt.
[00:35:21.575 --> 00:35:30.339]  And so, my grandmother, who's I guess 83 years old, she still remembers, growing up in Dallas, when they had to all turn their gold in.
[00:35:30.379 --> 00:35:35.360]  You were only allowed a wedding band, or a small amount, because the government said, we're going to give you paper for it.
[00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:37.001]  And when they turned their gold in,
[00:35:37.701 --> 00:35:41.002]  Again, the foreign European banks basically had control then as they do now.
[00:35:41.523 --> 00:35:49.686]  That was then shipped to Europe and one year later they doubled the price of gold and then started the devaluation that we're now at the end of today with the paper currency.
[00:35:50.906 --> 00:35:53.087]  Well, I also had two other points if you've got time.
[00:35:53.107 --> 00:35:53.347]  Sure.
[00:35:53.867 --> 00:36:00.970]  Okay, most of my acquaintances cannot comprehend an economy that is not based on Federal Reserve notes.
[00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:03.711]  I don't know how they're going to handle
[00:36:04.608 --> 00:36:12.234]  Any economic significant change, you know, it's just, you know, mind-boggling that they cannot comprehend it beyond that.
[00:36:12.394 --> 00:36:14.456]  And by the way, we're already in the change, folks.
[00:36:14.997 --> 00:36:16.238]  Over 70 percent.
[00:36:16.298 --> 00:36:22.783]  I've had the head of the New York Business School, I've had Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz, I've had all these top economists on this show.
[00:36:23.383 --> 00:36:23.623]  Next point.
[00:36:50.854 --> 00:36:55.238]  Do you, have you, are you familiar with the last verse of the Star Spangled Banner?
[00:36:56.719 --> 00:36:57.540]  Refresh my memory.
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:36:59.381]  Well, you want me to read it to you?
[00:36:59.401 --> 00:37:00.302]  Well, I know the story.
[00:37:00.342 --> 00:37:02.164]  He was out on the ship during the battle and wrote the poem.
[00:37:02.204 --> 00:37:04.786]  Yeah, but this is the verse, the actual verse.
[00:37:04.846 --> 00:37:06.327]  I could sing it or I could read it to you.
[00:37:06.487 --> 00:37:07.208]  Whatever you like.
[00:37:07.588 --> 00:37:15.335]  Oh, thus be it ever, when free men shall stand between their loved homes and the war's desolation.
[00:37:16.289 --> 00:37:24.770]  Blessed with victory and peace, may the heaven-rescued land praise the power that hath made and preserved us a nation.
[00:37:24.911 --> 00:37:31.852]  And I forgot that in the last 100 years they have taken that out of all the events and they don't read that final verse.
[00:37:32.092 --> 00:37:34.592]  Well, it's conspiratorial and wicked.
[00:37:37.593 --> 00:37:38.173]  Absolutely.
[00:37:38.893 --> 00:37:39.713]  May I continue?
[00:37:39.753 --> 00:37:39.953]  Sure.
[00:37:40.313 --> 00:37:43.674]  Then conquer we must when our cause it is just.
[00:37:43.694 --> 00:37:44.794]  Of course, right now it isn't.
[00:37:45.663 --> 00:37:49.184]  And this be our motto, and God is our trust.
[00:37:49.964 --> 00:37:57.985]  And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave, for the land of the free and the home of the brave.
[00:37:58.025 --> 00:37:59.986]  So they took out the next-to-last line.
[00:38:01.986 --> 00:38:04.126]  Well, I'm not sure what they took out, but that's the last one.
[00:38:04.346 --> 00:38:05.647]  Well, you never hear them sing that.
[00:38:05.887 --> 00:38:06.287]  Oh, no.
[00:38:08.947 --> 00:38:09.627]  That's amazing.
[00:38:09.747 --> 00:38:11.888]  Instead of me interrupting, read through that all again.
[00:38:11.908 --> 00:38:12.948]  Okay.
[00:38:17.532 --> 00:38:25.598]  Oh, thus be it ever when free men shall stand between their loved home and a war's desolation.
[00:38:26.458 --> 00:38:35.845]  Blessed with victory and peace, may the heaven-rescued land praise the power that hath made and preserved us a nation.
[00:38:36.806 --> 00:38:45.392]  Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just, and this be our motto, in God is our trust.
[00:38:51.448 --> 00:39:04.390]  Amazing call, and now the globalist, the oligarchy, the aristocracy, has come in and taken over our government and uses it as an engine of evil.
[00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:10.352]  They're afraid the people may wake up and try to take this country back, so they're putting in a police state to block it.
[00:39:11.072 --> 00:39:12.872]  And we're in very serious waters.
[00:39:13.462 --> 00:39:17.288]  Okay, let's go ahead and take another call.
[00:39:18.509 --> 00:39:20.592]  Go ahead and air Tyler for me please.
[00:39:21.453 --> 00:39:24.818]  Tyler from Canada, you are on the air.
[00:39:24.938 --> 00:39:25.299]  Welcome.
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:28.623]  Hey Alex, you really woke me up to a lot of things.
[00:39:28.703 --> 00:39:29.364]  Thanks for your show.
[00:39:30.993 --> 00:39:36.576]  I'd just like to say to our Solutions, yeah, I mean, I got all my money in silver and gold and I'm encouraging others to do the same.
[00:39:36.616 --> 00:39:37.597]  I'm growing my own food.
[00:39:37.617 --> 00:39:46.161]  And I went to an organic festival yesterday and we were listening to this guy, Percy Schmeiser, talk about how Monsanto seeds blew into his organic farm and contaminated them.
[00:39:46.641 --> 00:39:47.382]  You might have heard about it.
[00:39:48.102 --> 00:39:53.484]  Well, for those that don't know about Percy Schmeiser, I've interviewed him several times.
[00:40:06.485 --> 00:40:08.806]  And his case has been through court and has been proven.
[00:40:09.306 --> 00:40:11.567]  Monsanto, he had the bill of sale.
[00:40:11.587 --> 00:40:14.608]  He never bought their seeds for canola up in Canada.
[00:40:14.628 --> 00:40:17.189]  And the same thing's happened in the Dakotas and Texas and everywhere else.
[00:40:17.209 --> 00:40:18.170]  I've interviewed a lot of farmers.
[00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:23.972]  And then they fly over your land with aircraft and drop roundup bombs.
[00:40:24.514 --> 00:40:47.977]  That then kill large areas of your plants, violating your property rights, and if even one or two don't die, they know those plants have their terminator seed genetics, and then they sue you, claiming that you have infringed on their patent, when in court they admit it is their seeds that have blown and been carried by birds into your fields.
[00:40:49.341 --> 00:41:00.631]  Yeah, and well, anyway, after he was done doing his speech, you know, some other guy came up and he was talking about how a meat-eater riding a bike has a bigger carbon footprint than a vegetarian driving a car.
[00:41:01.271 --> 00:41:10.179]  And, you know, everyone's like, yeah, you know, and even after he talked about control, control, control, they still don't see, like, all of them exhale carbon dioxide and they just don't get it.
[00:41:10.179 --> 00:41:21.205]  That's what plants breathe, and we have the Club of Rome and CFR and UN documents where they say it's about a tax on human activity, a way to socialize all of our wealth.
[00:41:21.705 --> 00:41:22.125]  Absolutely.
[00:41:22.145 --> 00:41:23.866]  In fact, I have a story here out of the mail online.
[00:41:24.386 --> 00:41:39.234]  The floating cities that could one day house climate change refugees, and they have pictures of the devastated seashore and everybody basically, you know, we're going into this huge emergency when carbon dioxide has been 14 times higher than it is now and is a life-giving gas.
[00:41:40.276 --> 00:42:01.883]  Yeah, and just another thing, I'm in Vic 9-11 Truth, and we go out, we just got back from the swap and shop, which is like this big garage sale at the Western Speedway, and like at least 50% of the people that walk by like already know 9-11 was an inside job, but, so we don't, I think a lot of Canadians know, but they just, they're like, it's like the brave new world already, they're just like, yep, government's corrupt, everyone's corrupt.
[00:42:01.943 --> 00:42:05.824]  Absolutely, but let me guess, you guys were there as 9-11 Truth, educating people?
[00:42:06.474 --> 00:42:07.254]  Yeah, obviously, yeah.
[00:42:07.434 --> 00:42:08.315]  Good job, my friend.
[00:42:08.675 --> 00:42:13.657]  Yeah, for Americans that are hiding under a rock and don't know, there are hundreds of polls.
[00:42:13.797 --> 00:42:17.059]  Zogby, Mason, Dixon, Angus and Reid, New York Times.
[00:42:19.059 --> 00:42:19.620]  There are hundreds.
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:23.341]  The average poll is around 55 percent.
[00:42:23.841 --> 00:42:25.722]  You can look at all the different ones.
[00:42:25.742 --> 00:42:28.984]  Believe 9-11 is a total inside job.
[00:42:29.004 --> 00:42:31.885]  84 percent in Angus and Reid for the Wall Street Journal.
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:34.182]  Believe the government's covering up something.
[00:42:34.242 --> 00:42:36.425]  So, that shows the power of the people.
[00:42:36.945 --> 00:42:43.653]  I was really the first guy, the lone guy on the day of 9-11, saying it was an inside job, because I had seen the documents and knew they were planning something.
[00:42:44.354 --> 00:42:51.762]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with more of your calls, more stimulating information, more thought-provoking info.
[00:42:51.782 --> 00:42:52.163]  Stay with us.
[00:42:53.263 --> 00:42:58.927]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[00:42:59.207 --> 00:43:03.971]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[00:43:03.991 --> 00:43:09.214]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.

[00:43:13.337 --> 00:43:21.505]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[00:43:21.845 --> 00:43:26.810]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:33.396]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[00:43:33.636 --> 00:43:35.958]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[00:43:36.238 --> 00:43:38.660]  Cannot survive in an alkaline environment.

[00:43:54.224 --> 00:44:01.408]  Even terrible gas prices don't come close to the disaster of food costs from shortages already destroying millions of American families.
[00:44:01.668 --> 00:44:05.191]  Wheat for flour is already four times more expensive than it was about a year ago.
[00:44:05.711 --> 00:44:09.373]  Food costs continue to double because there's no food worldwide.

[00:45:02.613 --> 00:45:10.777]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[00:45:52.995 --> 00:45:55.938]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:45:56.098 --> 00:46:01.343]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:46:01.603 --> 00:46:06.948]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:46:07.348 --> 00:46:08.449]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:17.818]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.

[00:46:57.123 --> 00:47:01.304]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:47:13.650 --> 00:47:16.592]  I've got a caller here, Harley, from New Braunfels, Texas.
[00:47:18.033 --> 00:47:20.194]  He says, you're wrong about the peso.
[00:47:20.214 --> 00:47:37.786]  Now, they just told me about this caller about 60 seconds ago, and I went on Google and went to x-rates, and I ran out of time before I got on air to try to check what it is today, because it changes day to day, but I know I was reading the Associated Press about two weeks ago,
[00:47:38.607 --> 00:47:42.030]  And it showed the peso at 5.3 for the dollar.
[00:47:42.110 --> 00:47:44.572]  So I went on air and said, 5 to 1.
[00:47:46.073 --> 00:47:54.740]  And while he's talking, I'm going to try to search around and because it doesn't just let you, it'll show you the peso, but then the dollar's on another page.
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:57.402]  I've got to put the two in here and compute it.
[00:47:58.503 --> 00:48:01.225]  But I'm wondering where he's getting his facts.
[00:48:01.245 --> 00:48:02.506]  Look, there's no debate.
[00:48:02.546 --> 00:48:07.530]  The dollar has, the euro opened at 84 cents to the dollar.
[00:48:09.455 --> 00:48:15.797]  In 2000, when the dollar was worth a dollar versus the euro.
[00:48:15.817 --> 00:48:20.479]  It had already dropped since 1913 when the Federal Reserve took over, but it was a decade-to-decade thing.
[00:48:20.519 --> 00:48:21.399]  It was a slow slide.
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:26.381]  But the dollar, at the current value it had, was a dollar to the euro at 84.
[00:48:27.742 --> 00:48:30.563]  And then now the euro is one
[00:48:32.023 --> 00:48:32.844]  We're good.
[00:48:48.654 --> 00:48:58.138]  I have a lot of people who just tell me that is not true, the dollar has not been devalued, as if just saying it hasn't been devalued magically makes that be the case.
[00:48:58.498 --> 00:49:10.983]  You see, I want to enlighten the public about this, but my megaphone I guess isn't big enough, so that we can put political pressure on Mr. Paulson, Secretary of the Treasury, to reverse the
[00:49:12.457 --> 00:49:17.640]  Really, 80 plus year policy of a weak dollar.
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:28.465]  Now, they can say, well, we had Bretton Woods a half century ago, and we've had other agreements that the dollar would be the world reserve currency.
[00:49:28.545 --> 00:49:28.865]  Yes.
[00:49:29.585 --> 00:49:33.287]  So it's a strong dollar globally, but overall the dollar has been losing its value.
[00:49:33.787 --> 00:49:35.888]  I mean, it's hard to explain this, I guess.
[00:49:35.928 --> 00:49:36.548]  It's so simple.
[00:49:36.568 --> 00:49:37.909]  Sometimes simple things are hard to explain.
[00:49:39.424 --> 00:49:40.845]  You can pull the numbers up, but what?
[00:49:40.885 --> 00:49:43.806]  A three-bedroom house in the 60s was like $3,000, $4,000.
[00:49:44.547 --> 00:49:48.508]  A new car was a couple thousand dollars.
[00:49:49.629 --> 00:49:50.589]  Now how much are things?
[00:49:50.629 --> 00:49:52.350]  I mean, there's massive inflation.
[00:49:52.810 --> 00:49:55.272]  The Fed says inflation's at about 7% right now.
[00:49:55.552 --> 00:49:58.753]  They were saying last year, when every other private group was saying about 12, 13%, they were saying 2.5.
[00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:06.664]  I mean, the government puts out all these different fake numbers so you can debate things all day long.
[00:50:07.005 --> 00:50:08.526]  The dollar is devaluing.
[00:50:08.666 --> 00:50:10.027]  Are you paying more for things?
[00:50:11.549 --> 00:50:13.850]  And by the way, it's devalued more overseas.
[00:50:15.192 --> 00:50:15.532]  Okay?
[00:50:15.832 --> 00:50:16.793]  Because that always happens.
[00:50:16.813 --> 00:50:23.198]  When a currency is devalued, the last place the full devaluation takes place is inside the country.
[00:50:24.239 --> 00:50:26.381]  And that's the big secret they want to keep from you.
[00:50:27.345 --> 00:50:28.266]  Until it's too late.
[00:50:28.326 --> 00:50:29.807]  Now, why would the government want to do that?
[00:50:30.107 --> 00:50:32.349]  They've run up so many tens of trillions in debts.
[00:50:32.689 --> 00:50:37.433]  They've bought, through other corporations, and through all these scams, real assets.
[00:50:37.473 --> 00:50:39.074]  Now they're going to leave us holding the bag.
[00:50:41.604 --> 00:50:46.566]  Let's go ahead and go to Harley in New Braunfels, Texas, who says I'm wrong.
[00:50:46.846 --> 00:50:47.486]  Go ahead, Harley.
[00:50:47.807 --> 00:50:48.827]  Yeah, Alex, listen.
[00:50:49.167 --> 00:50:52.428]  I'm certainly not going to defend the dollar.
[00:50:52.588 --> 00:50:54.209]  Everything you just said was true.
[00:50:54.729 --> 00:50:59.851]  But you had a caller last week say that he was down in Mexico and he got five pesos to the dollar.
[00:51:00.252 --> 00:51:01.672]  And then I just heard you repeat it.
[00:51:02.012 --> 00:51:03.713]  No, that's not where that came from.
[00:51:04.093 --> 00:51:10.959]  I was saying 5 to 1 was in the news, 5.3, and then the caller called in and agreed.
[00:51:10.979 --> 00:51:12.099]  I didn't get that from a caller.
[00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:17.804]  Well, you might not have gotten it from a caller, but I heard it over the air by a caller last week.
[00:51:18.465 --> 00:51:19.325]  And he's full of it.
[00:51:19.625 --> 00:51:23.529]  I'm looking right now at xrates.com, the peso is sitting at 10.36.
[00:51:25.814 --> 00:51:34.141]  Now, everything you said about the dollar is true, but when you said it's been devalued to the peso 5 to 1, brother, that's way wrong.
[00:51:34.361 --> 00:51:37.184]  And I got friends in Mexico, I used to live in Monterey.
[00:51:38.665 --> 00:51:41.207]  Like I said, I went to shock when I heard that.
[00:51:41.627 --> 00:51:44.630]  And I checked it out, and it was not true, and it's not true now.
[00:51:45.190 --> 00:51:50.615]  And just for your information, I showed the euro sitting at 1.57 today.
[00:51:51.015 --> 00:51:52.757]  So it's even worse than what you just said.
[00:51:53.437 --> 00:51:55.798]  So, the fiat currency... Okay, stop right there.
[00:51:55.878 --> 00:51:56.379]  Stop right there.
[00:51:56.539 --> 00:52:00.541]  I keep all the news I get in big, giant stacks.
[00:52:01.101 --> 00:52:07.465]  And I'm telling you, about two weeks ago, I believe it was Associated Press, now it may have been some currency spike,
[00:52:08.110 --> 00:52:15.862]  I mean I know all the currency markets are going crazy up and down and so certainly now that may be the case.
[00:52:15.902 --> 00:52:20.709]  I mean talking to you and sitting here it's hard to talk and chew gum at the same time.
[00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:23.253]  As they say I'm on the same side.
[00:52:23.593 --> 00:52:25.253]  You're able to sit there and do the calculation.
[00:52:25.633 --> 00:52:38.936]  My whole point is, is that me saying that and the caller calling in and agreeing, you know, whether it's 10 to 1 or whatever, if you know the history of this, because I was asking family about it last night, hasn't the peso been, at certain times when they've had crashes, like 100 to 1?
[00:52:40.176 --> 00:52:45.918]  I've been down to Mexico when you could get 350 to 1, and then it changed overnight.
[00:52:46.118 --> 00:52:47.598]  I mean, that's the Mexican peso.
[00:52:48.458 --> 00:52:53.222]  And was it 12.5 to 1 what it was in the 60's and 70's for a long time?
[00:52:54.263 --> 00:52:56.884]  When they had the Olympics in the 60's it was 8 to 1.
[00:52:57.545 --> 00:53:00.547]  And it spiked up to 300 and something at one point.
[00:53:00.567 --> 00:53:01.888]  My uncle did a lot of work down there.
[00:53:01.908 --> 00:53:03.970]  He was saying it was 12 to 1 for more than a decade.
[00:53:04.070 --> 00:53:07.532]  But that's Mexico's pesos problem.
[00:53:07.592 --> 00:53:09.954]  None of us are putting our money in pesos, I guarantee you.
[00:53:11.481 --> 00:53:13.843]  Look, look, we're sitting here debating apples and oranges.
[00:53:14.043 --> 00:53:15.044]  I know I saw that.
[00:53:15.764 --> 00:53:16.965]  Currently, does it go up and down?
[00:53:17.005 --> 00:53:17.246]  Yes.
[00:53:17.426 --> 00:53:21.068]  The bottom line is, as you said, it's been... I haven't seen that.
[00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:26.192]  The most I found online in a history was 100 to 1, but you're saying 300 and something to 1.
[00:53:27.433 --> 00:53:45.785]  My whole point is, the pesos, 10 to 1, 5 to 1, whatever it is right now, because it goes up and down each day, my point is, see, I just gave you a conservative number from the last time I checked last week, at, you know, 147 euro to the dollar, and you're saying you just looked and it's worse.
[00:53:46.066 --> 00:53:55.852]  My point is, we can, it's like we ran up to a burning house, and there's flames shooting out the window, and we're arguing whether every room's on fire, only 80% of it.
[00:53:56.112 --> 00:53:56.913]  Hell, man, I don't know.
[00:53:57.273 --> 00:54:00.176]  Alex, like I said, I'm with you 90%.
[00:54:00.657 --> 00:54:03.019]  When you said 5-1, it scared the heck out of me.
[00:54:03.059 --> 00:54:03.720]  I checked it out.
[00:54:04.761 --> 00:54:06.683]  I can't say it never went there.
[00:54:06.863 --> 00:54:07.464]  I don't know.
[00:54:07.584 --> 00:54:11.408]  Look, I'm just saying, I read... It's either AP or Bloomberg.
[00:54:11.568 --> 00:54:13.430]  I can't remember every story I covered two weeks ago.
[00:54:13.931 --> 00:54:16.053]  I remember people freaking out.
[00:54:16.253 --> 00:54:19.737]  I remember, actually, Trey, my producer, he runs in with stacks of interesting stuff.
[00:54:20.137 --> 00:54:24.059]  Because I had Bob Chapman on about the dollar, and I saw that.
[00:54:24.299 --> 00:54:29.482]  Now, whether that was a one-day spike... Look, regardless, it used to be 101, now it's 10 to 1.
[00:54:30.083 --> 00:54:32.804]  And that's what I had seen a few weeks ago was 10 to 1.
[00:54:33.064 --> 00:54:36.286]  That's why I freaked out when I saw 5.3 to 1.
[00:54:37.267 --> 00:54:37.767]  Anything else?
[00:54:38.207 --> 00:54:39.668]  I just want to tell you, keep it up.
[00:54:39.828 --> 00:54:41.369]  I really appreciate what you're doing.
[00:54:41.429 --> 00:54:44.411]  So much so, I'm close enough to try to go to work for you at some point.
[00:54:44.431 --> 00:54:48.213]  But what I'm telling you is, when you said that... Sure, sure, I understand.
[00:54:50.024 --> 00:54:53.227]  The problem is, during the next break, I'm going to try to search around and find out what it is today.
[00:54:53.707 --> 00:54:53.987]  Okay?
[00:54:54.528 --> 00:54:55.068]  It doesn't matter.
[00:54:55.249 --> 00:54:55.989]  10 to 1, 5 to 1.
[00:54:56.029 --> 00:54:59.292]  The point is, as you said, the peso used to be 100 to 1.
[00:54:59.332 --> 00:55:00.634]  You're saying 300 and something to 1.
[00:55:00.834 --> 00:55:01.655]  I never saw that.
[00:55:01.675 --> 00:55:07.040]  I mean, I know Salinas, their president, had to run and leave when he basically looted the economy.
[00:55:07.901 --> 00:55:09.142]  That's happening now to us.
[00:55:10.621 --> 00:55:11.522]  And I didn't know that.
[00:55:11.582 --> 00:55:14.906]  My God, has the Euro gone over 150 to the dollar?
[00:55:15.486 --> 00:55:18.309]  I mean, this stuff, it's impossible to keep track of all this.
[00:55:18.670 --> 00:55:20.572]  Okay, let's go ahead and take another call.
[00:55:20.592 --> 00:55:24.816]  I mean, it's kind of like arguing about did you cut off five fingers or one?
[00:55:24.876 --> 00:55:28.620]  I mean, the point is, we're in a lot of trouble here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:29.329 --> 00:55:32.710]  It's like if somebody knocks five of your teeth out and you say, oh, he knocked all my teeth out.
[00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:35.411]  You know, you've got a lot of teeth knocked out here.
[00:55:36.031 --> 00:55:39.332]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Matt in Austin.
[00:55:39.352 --> 00:55:39.852]  You're on the air.
[00:55:39.892 --> 00:55:40.533]  Go ahead, Matt.
[00:55:41.233 --> 00:55:41.773]  Hey, Alex.
[00:55:41.913 --> 00:55:42.993]  It's nice to talk to you.
[00:55:43.293 --> 00:55:43.994]  Nice to talk to you.
[00:55:44.874 --> 00:55:57.518]  My question, or what I was hoping you could do, is outline the top three reasons, in your opinion, because I don't necessarily understand why Iran is now al-Qaeda and we need to invade.
[00:55:59.102 --> 00:56:05.489]  Well, number one, we all know Iran is an Islamic Republic under the Shiite brand.
[00:56:05.569 --> 00:56:17.602]  There's two big arms of Islam, and the largest one is the Wahhabist, out of Saudi Arabia, I believe, and then the subgroup, but the second largest, is the Shiite.
[00:56:18.243 --> 00:56:25.725]  And Iran is a Shiite Republic, and run by the Imams, and I'm not defending it, it's very corrupt.
[00:56:26.306 --> 00:56:31.547]  By the way, in all the polls, their population completely hates them, and has been pro-America until we attack them, and they're going to hate us.
[00:56:32.528 --> 00:56:40.070]  Then you've got what's going on with the United States, as Cy Hirsch reported in New Yorker Magazine,
[00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:46.839]  Five years ago, as Bush has admitted now, they're running four different Wahhabist Al Qaeda groups out of Saudi Arabia.
[00:56:46.959 --> 00:56:47.721]  Real Al Qaeda.
[00:56:47.821 --> 00:56:50.725]  Number three in Al Qaeda is the mainstream news headline.
[00:56:50.745 --> 00:56:51.406]  Just Google that.
[00:56:51.987 --> 00:56:53.268]  Attacking Iran.
[00:56:53.348 --> 00:56:54.610]  Blowing up mosques.
[00:56:54.650 --> 00:56:55.471]  Attacking schools.
[00:56:55.552 --> 00:56:56.313]  Police stations.
[00:56:56.753 --> 00:56:58.073]  And Iran is suing the U.S.
[00:56:58.173 --> 00:56:58.773]  and the U.S.
[00:56:58.833 --> 00:57:14.616]  admits, that is people running our government, admit, the criminals, demonizing our name, admit, yes, we're running Al-Qaeda attacks against Iran, and they have such disrespect for the general public, that they then turn around and tell us on the news that Iran runs Al-Qaeda.
[00:57:14.896 --> 00:57:16.417]  You want to hold over and ask the other part?
[00:57:16.977 --> 00:57:17.137]  Here.
[00:57:17.497 --> 00:57:18.317]  Alright, I'll put you on hold.
[00:57:19.657 --> 00:57:22.538]  I mean, the lies are so incredible,
[00:57:23.775 --> 00:57:26.497]  That it's even hard for me to get my mind around it.
[00:57:27.378 --> 00:57:28.859]  Iran fights Al Qaeda.
[00:57:28.959 --> 00:57:33.362]  It's like Mohammed Karzai, the installed puppet in Afghanistan, was over in the U.S.
[00:57:33.402 --> 00:57:38.286]  a few months ago, and the President Bush said, Iran's with Al Qaeda, and he said, no they're not.
[00:57:38.706 --> 00:57:40.267]  Because he lives there, he knows it's not true.
[00:57:40.427 --> 00:57:41.148]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:47.672]  It's no secret that Genesis Communications Network depends on listeners like you.

[01:00:09.690 --> 01:00:17.713]  We're supposed to have a drier, considerably warmer conditions down here in the Big Sur area and that will certainly
[01:00:18.713 --> 01:00:21.896]  Push the fire, could push the fire towards those lines and challenge those lines.

[01:06:34.369 --> 01:06:44.377]  On the Iran front, just out of the French News Agency, Iran warns of Gulf blitzkrieg and a closure of the Straits of Hormuz if attacked.
[01:06:44.857 --> 01:06:56.307]  Iran's military chiefs warned Saturday that the Islamic Republic would shut down the Strait of Hormuz, vital for oil exports, and use blitzkrieg tactics, or lightning war tactics, in the Gulf if it came under attack.
[01:06:56.847 --> 01:07:00.450]  And they have medium-range missiles, more than 11,000 of them, that can just
[01:07:02.796 --> 01:07:21.083]  Destroy the three different fleets carrier task force groups they have there in the Persian Gulf But I guess that's the plan if there's an attack And then the US will see our ships sinking the people will say nuke them and then it's off to the races It's off to $8 a gallon gas even if you don't care about Attacking a country that's done nothing to us
[01:07:21.603 --> 01:07:23.624]  And been overthrown twice by our government.
[01:07:25.025 --> 01:07:27.486]  Just absolutely amazing that that is going on.
[01:07:27.526 --> 01:07:28.846]  And Ron Paul is in Congress.
[01:07:29.226 --> 01:07:30.307]  I interviewed him Thursday.
[01:07:30.367 --> 01:07:36.270]  Congressman Ron Paul, he said he hears a lot of members in the halls talking about if we could only nuke Iran.
[01:07:36.290 --> 01:07:37.190]  I'm going to get into that.
[01:07:37.970 --> 01:07:47.314]  Also, I'm not sure he's calling about this, but it just says on my screen here that he mentioned, as a heating and AC guy, something about registering with the feds.
[01:07:48.315 --> 01:07:50.516]  But I do have a report here out of
[01:07:51.784 --> 01:08:06.427]  uh... computer magazine and then it even has links to the state of texas uh... website with the bill i couldn't believe this when i read even though it was a reputable uh... source computer magazine uh... and
[01:08:07.601 --> 01:08:08.942]  I read the bill and couldn't believe it.
[01:08:09.963 --> 01:08:21.432]  Anyone repairing computers in Texas will have to get a three-year law enforcement degree and violate your Fourth and Fifth Amendment and spy on the entire contents of your computer without being paid.
[01:08:21.852 --> 01:08:25.935]  The government's telling computer repair shops that it's also indentured servitude.
[01:08:25.955 --> 01:08:28.237]  It violates another area of the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:08:30.177 --> 01:08:35.499]  Where they're not allowed to tell you to do work without paying you, and saying you're going to spy on everyone.
[01:08:35.539 --> 01:08:37.359]  So I want to go over that report.
[01:08:37.919 --> 01:08:51.423]  Going back to Matt in Austin, he had a question about why is the news saying Iran is al-Qaeda and running al-Qaeda attacks in Iraq, when Iran is run by Shiites?
[01:08:51.724 --> 01:08:52.924]  Did I answer your question, Matt?
[01:08:54.124 --> 01:08:58.546]  Actually, I was more wondering what's going to be the ultimate benefit to us?
[01:08:58.646 --> 01:08:59.506]  Is it greater
[01:09:00.825 --> 01:09:01.946]  Control of the region?
[01:09:02.086 --> 01:09:04.068]  Is it control of oil production?
[01:09:04.108 --> 01:09:06.089]  Is it to make Israel happy?
[01:09:06.349 --> 01:09:09.351]  What exactly is the outcome that we expect to get out of this?
[01:09:30.806 --> 01:09:44.418]  Uh, O'Neal, the first day he was at the White House, this is in January of 2001, shows up and they have the Energy Task Force, he wrote about this, with maps and they were saying, how are we going to get it?
[01:09:44.438 --> 01:09:45.499]  And Janey says, you'll see.
[01:09:46.466 --> 01:09:50.009]  And it was all about shutting down oil exploration.
[01:09:50.609 --> 01:09:52.430]  That then jacks up prices.
[01:09:52.510 --> 01:10:02.297]  Remember that Iraq had quote, been over pumping in 1990 and OPEC was mad because we were paying, I don't know, 89, 95 cents during that period.
[01:10:02.317 --> 01:10:03.318]  You can go look it up.
[01:10:03.998 --> 01:10:08.501]  And that was making OPEC and the oil companies mad because we weren't getting charged enough.
[01:10:08.561 --> 01:10:12.484]  So by shutting down Iraqi flow during that war,
[01:10:13.004 --> 01:10:19.777]  And then having Saddam sign deals under sanctions, where he can only sell a reduced amount, that jacked up prices then.
[01:10:19.797 --> 01:10:20.178]  You understand?
[01:10:20.218 --> 01:10:21.982]  It's artificial scarcity.
[01:10:22.881 --> 01:10:24.342]  Pete, I mean, let's talk about watermelons.
[01:10:24.382 --> 01:10:27.225]  It's watermelon season, driving in from seeing family across Texas.
[01:10:27.245 --> 01:10:28.866]  I saw trucks everywhere full of watermelons.
[01:10:29.867 --> 01:10:33.269]  Let's say I'm a big watermelon magnate who wants to sell them to all the grocery stores.
[01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:36.452]  Well, you see, I don't want more watermelons getting grown.
[01:10:36.572 --> 01:10:45.679]  If I could get a law passed where only I could grow watermelons, I would, you know, do that if I was a bad guy so that people would pay $50 for a watermelon instead of $2.
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:55.327]  Okay, so it's artificial scarcity, kind of like diamonds are semi-precious, but the Oppenheyer family and the company De Beers has a world monopoly, and that's public knowledge.
[01:10:55.347 --> 01:11:00.451]  PBS did Diamond Empire, a documentary on it, and I actually interviewed the British lady.
[01:11:01.471 --> 01:11:11.259]  She's a royal who made the film about that, and they got very mad about that and visited her at her yacht there in London and beat her half to death and told her never make another film about it.
[01:11:12.099 --> 01:11:13.781]  It's just amazing stuff, but the point is,
[01:11:14.401 --> 01:11:16.462]  It is artificial scarcity.
[01:11:16.742 --> 01:11:18.822]  So that was one reason to shut the oil off.
[01:11:19.262 --> 01:11:24.084]  Then it's hundreds of billions a year in no-bid contracts going into a black hole.
[01:11:24.344 --> 01:11:26.725]  Fifteen million dollars for a blue tarp Halliburton puts up.
[01:11:26.745 --> 01:11:27.465]  That's a real case.
[01:11:28.525 --> 01:11:29.986]  It's about a domestic police state.
[01:11:30.246 --> 01:11:32.526]  When we're in a war, they can tell the people shut up.
[01:11:32.806 --> 01:11:37.968]  When you're in a war, you shut up and don't ask questions, which is the opposite of liberty and freedom and what a true patriot
[01:11:38.428 --> 01:11:39.169]  You're supposed to do.
[01:11:39.529 --> 01:11:45.853]  And yes, Israel has said they want these wars, they want these countries taken down, they want client countries that will give them oil.
[01:11:46.213 --> 01:11:46.794]  The U.S.
[01:11:46.814 --> 01:11:52.978]  has now built a pipeline out of Iraq into Jordan and then down into Israel.
[01:11:54.258 --> 01:11:55.259]  That's going on.
[01:11:55.539 --> 01:11:58.001]  So there's a whole cocktail of reasons.
[01:11:58.061 --> 01:12:07.087]  But they want to go into Iran, really as a political diversion for the plunging dollar, because they had people that were
[01:12:08.263 --> 01:12:08.724]  Absolutely.
[01:12:36.215 --> 01:12:36.675]  Great Alex.
[01:12:36.695 --> 01:12:38.036]  Hey listen, I love your show.
[01:12:38.056 --> 01:12:38.777]  I listen all the time.
[01:12:38.797 --> 01:12:39.437]  Good luck to you.
[01:12:39.697 --> 01:12:40.378]  Thank you my friend.
[01:12:40.398 --> 01:12:41.178]  I appreciate your call.
[01:12:41.198 --> 01:12:49.703]  Okay, I want to go ahead and start going to this caller now and see what he's talking about specifically and then I'm going to get into this report about how basically every service company in the U.S.
[01:12:50.283 --> 01:12:55.827]  on a state-by-state and federal basis is being co-opted into spying on you when they're in your home.
[01:12:56.267 --> 01:13:02.331]  So let's go ahead and go to Joe in Austin who wanted to talk about that.
[01:13:02.391 --> 01:13:02.951]  Joe, go ahead.
[01:13:03.755 --> 01:13:04.916]  Hey Alex, how's it going brother?
[01:13:05.136 --> 01:13:07.338]  Good, I only got a little bit that it was something about that.
[01:13:07.378 --> 01:13:08.439]  Is that what you're calling in about?
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:10.601]  Oh yeah, yes, yes.
[01:13:10.661 --> 01:13:11.502]  I'm the SE Tech.
[01:13:12.282 --> 01:13:14.704]  I just got in with this last week, so this is kind of new to me.
[01:13:14.724 --> 01:13:18.207]  I'm just wondering what your take is on this.
[01:13:19.308 --> 01:13:24.072]  We have to register with the state now and do a yearly fee for like $20 to $25.
[01:13:24.212 --> 01:13:26.354]  I don't know what the cost is yet.
[01:13:26.594 --> 01:13:28.075]  I mean, they haven't told me yet.
[01:13:28.296 --> 01:13:29.036]  They think it's like $20 to $25.
[01:13:30.467 --> 01:13:37.974]  So is this a money grab or is this a double-edged sword where it's going to be... That's the start of regulation, the start of control.
[01:13:38.274 --> 01:13:50.846]  The bigger air conditioning construction companies and others want to come in and start kind of like it is in England and in Europe where you have to have a whole bunch of licenses to do work so that they can cut out their competition.
[01:13:50.946 --> 01:13:56.111]  No, what you're talking about is not the other issue that I'm about to get into.
[01:13:57.230 --> 01:13:58.493]  Okay, well I appreciate that, Jim.
[01:13:58.794 --> 01:13:59.455]  You bet, my friend.
[01:13:59.495 --> 01:13:59.876]  Thank you.
[01:14:00.738 --> 01:14:01.941]  Now, listen, this is in...
[01:14:03.729 --> 01:14:31.819]  several different publications computer mag uh... extreme tech others have reported on this and there's a story out of gear log on this as well but you can link through uh... at info wars dot com we posted this friday texas pc repair shop now requires p i license and i read this i did not believe it but just google that texas pc repair now requires private investigator license
[01:14:32.665 --> 01:14:38.989]  Google that, and then this is a great article because when you read it, it's got links to the Texas Legislature.
[01:14:39.390 --> 01:14:46.794]  In fact, the second paragraph, the word Texas is a hyperlink, and you go right to the legislature's website, and I couldn't believe it.
[01:14:46.855 --> 01:14:50.037]  I mean, there's a lot of things that even shock me, folks.
[01:14:50.637 --> 01:15:00.664]  And it says, from its Texas Rangers to its enthusiastic take on the death penalty, Lone Star State has long been known for its aggressive stance on law enforcement.
[01:15:03.144 --> 01:15:05.926]  What the illegal aliens are above the law, what are you talking about?
[01:15:05.966 --> 01:15:13.753]  Thanks to a strange new law, it's a sting that may soon be felt by a number of Texas computer repair people.
[01:15:14.213 --> 01:15:23.601]  A recently passed law requires that Texas computer repair technicians have a private investigator license according to a story posted by a Dallas-Fort Worth CW affiliate.
[01:15:24.021 --> 01:15:28.345]  Now when we come back I'm going to get into this and take more of your calls and break down what this means.
[01:15:29.266 --> 01:15:30.767]  When a carpet cleaner is in your house,
[01:15:31.269 --> 01:15:33.650]  When an AC guy's in your house.
[01:15:34.450 --> 01:15:39.271]  A lot of them make more money tattling on people than they make with a job.
[01:15:39.331 --> 01:15:40.631]  And it violates the Fourth Amendment.
[01:15:40.991 --> 01:15:42.432]  And you should know this is going on.
[01:15:43.072 --> 01:15:43.852]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:43.892 --> 01:15:46.273]  My new film, Truth Rising, was released Friday.
[01:15:46.533 --> 01:15:47.333]  It's now available.
[01:15:51.714 --> 01:15:52.394]  Question.
[01:15:52.534 --> 01:15:57.115]  Is the world getting better or vastly worse?
[01:15:57.275 --> 01:16:00.736]  A world economic collapse could come any day.
[01:16:01.744 --> 01:16:02.284]  Question.
[01:16:02.584 --> 01:16:03.745]  Are you prepared?
[01:16:04.145 --> 01:16:06.126]  Or are you ignoring the signs?
[01:16:07.866 --> 01:16:08.447]  Question.
[01:16:08.627 --> 01:16:15.570]  Do you have seven years of healthy food for your family?
[01:16:15.890 --> 01:16:16.130]  Answer.

[01:17:00.499 --> 01:17:05.722]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[01:17:05.942 --> 01:17:16.449]  Though the people of the U.S., where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reigning them in and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[01:17:16.929 --> 01:17:20.950]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[01:17:21.330 --> 01:17:23.791]  They oppose everything that is God and Truth.
[01:17:24.111 --> 01:17:27.352]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[01:17:27.692 --> 01:17:40.195]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the Earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.

[01:20:23.041 --> 01:20:23.762]  Many, many others.
[01:20:24.842 --> 01:20:28.585]  I've already got a caller here, Mike in Houston, saying you're wrong about PC tech.
[01:20:29.645 --> 01:20:31.487]  Look, I went and read the bill.
[01:20:33.548 --> 01:20:36.630]  And it's in, what, five different publications that I've seen.
[01:20:37.030 --> 01:20:38.011]  I couldn't believe it either.
[01:20:38.471 --> 01:20:46.677]  The way this is written, if they interpret it to enforce it, this won't be, if you want to be a tattletale spy, you can be.
[01:20:47.337 --> 01:20:50.019]  This will be, you have to basically do it.
[01:20:50.922 --> 01:20:54.283]  And everybody's heard the stories about 60 Minutes shows about it.
[01:20:55.183 --> 01:21:02.325]  Where the people at the airport, you know, ticket takers who enter your information, check your driver's license.
[01:21:02.705 --> 01:21:10.748]  The famous 60 Minutes piece where this guy would fly down from North Carolina to Houston to buy tens of thousands of dollars of trees to be shipped back each year.
[01:21:11.188 --> 01:21:12.568]  And he walked up and paid with cash.
[01:21:12.588 --> 01:21:13.708]  This was like a decade ago.
[01:21:14.449 --> 01:21:17.349]  And they seized his cash under asset forfeiture seizure.
[01:21:17.469 --> 01:21:19.650]  People can't believe this when they hear it until you look it up.
[01:21:20.293 --> 01:21:25.315]  And they said, yeah, we're not going to indict you, we're not going to arrest you, we're just taking your money, no judge, no jury.
[01:21:26.495 --> 01:21:33.017]  And everybody now has heard about Asset Forfeiture Seizure, where they pull you over and you've got $4,000 in your wallet, or in your purse, and they just take it.
[01:21:33.817 --> 01:21:36.038]  Saying, well, it's up to you to prove it wasn't for drugs.
[01:21:37.578 --> 01:21:39.039]  And this happened to me, folks.
[01:21:39.839 --> 01:21:49.482]  I guess it was about nine years ago, I had a shotgun, that's where I had children, in a rack, and my radio studio was in my house, not at my office, or here in these radio studios.
[01:21:50.134 --> 01:21:53.076]  And the guy walks in and he's saying, is that gun legal?
[01:21:53.277 --> 01:21:54.378]  I said, well of course it's legal.
[01:21:54.758 --> 01:22:01.964]  There happened to be myself on the front page of the Metro and State at a Second Amendment rally and I said, see, we have rallies about the Second Amendment, it's no big deal.
[01:22:02.604 --> 01:22:16.356]  And then he left and I had a bad feeling so I called the carpet cleaning place and they said, no Mr. Jones, yes we understand, yes he did, there was some discussion of calling the police, we understand that guns are legal, but see, these people watch TV shows.
[01:22:17.262 --> 01:22:27.609]  And most of them are set in New York or Chicago, where they have highly restrictive gun laws, and they see the cops pull somebody over in a drama, or they watch real cop shows based in L.A.
[01:22:27.649 --> 01:22:28.369]  and places, and oh!
[01:22:28.629 --> 01:22:29.250]  He's got a gun!
[01:22:29.290 --> 01:22:30.150]  He's going to jail!
[01:22:30.451 --> 01:22:31.932]  Or we found guns in his house!
[01:22:32.432 --> 01:22:33.352]  He's going to jail!
[01:22:33.853 --> 01:22:41.178]  And so they then move here to Austin, where they watch TV, and the public's pretty dumbed down, and they think a gun in your house is illegal.
[01:22:42.158 --> 01:22:43.759]  I mean, here's an example.
[01:22:43.799 --> 01:22:44.620]  The Austin PD
[01:22:46.184 --> 01:22:50.607]  Looks at your occupancy, how many people live in your house, and how much power you're using.
[01:22:51.147 --> 01:23:02.915]  And if it looks like you're using too much power, that then is, quote, probable cause, they believe, of course it isn't, to SWAT team your house and see if you are growing marijuana because the lights pull a bunch of power.
[01:23:03.415 --> 01:23:10.280]  They also fly around with these helicopters that see, you know, heat resonance, and oh, it looks like you've got grow lights in your house.
[01:23:11.204 --> 01:23:13.167]  Uh, so the point here is, well, here's an example.
[01:23:13.608 --> 01:23:15.490]  I lived in an apartment complex.
[01:23:15.551 --> 01:23:17.674]  This is before I was on the air, about 14 years ago.
[01:23:18.154 --> 01:23:19.556]  And my buddy was going to UT.
[01:23:19.596 --> 01:23:20.638]  His girlfriend was going to UT.
[01:23:20.658 --> 01:23:22.681]  They lived together about two doors down.
[01:23:23.766 --> 01:23:27.469]  Straight-laced folks, didn't even smoke pot, and didn't even drink.
[01:23:27.969 --> 01:23:31.412]  And I remember that they got a SWAT team visit.
[01:23:32.012 --> 01:23:42.821]  Now, they actually knocked on the door, they opened it and came in, and because they had had some repair guy there, and he had seen, she was taking botany at UT, the grow light, a little grow light and some orchids.
[01:23:43.681 --> 01:23:45.463]  And then they saw that it wasn't drugs and left.
[01:23:45.503 --> 01:23:52.028]  The point is, people need to know that repair people in your home are spying on you.
[01:23:53.331 --> 01:23:54.332]  You need to know that.
[01:23:55.373 --> 01:24:07.743]  I was visiting family and they had a May issue of National Geographic in it and it had a picture, it was a whole issue on China and it was a fascinating issue.
[01:24:07.763 --> 01:24:18.553]  I read the whole thing on Friday night and in it, it had a photo of what looked like about a eight-year-old boy who was swimming in
[01:24:22.125 --> 01:24:31.885]  a river and he came out he was naked now if you take a photo of your two-year-old in a bathtub
[01:24:32.961 --> 01:24:39.987]  And you take it to one of the major stores to get it developed, a drug store, one of the big super stores, you're probably going to have the police come and arrest you.
[01:24:40.588 --> 01:24:41.609]  Or SWAT team.
[01:24:42.049 --> 01:24:44.631]  But see, National Geographic can put that in there.
[01:24:44.911 --> 01:24:48.334]  So see, you're saying, I have nothing to hide having my computer being looked through.
[01:24:48.835 --> 01:24:52.178]  Oh yeah, there's a baby picture with your baby's hind end in it?
[01:24:53.018 --> 01:24:55.821]  And see, the government and the system wants to enforce on the public.
[01:24:56.541 --> 01:24:57.322]  Here's another example.
[01:24:57.622 --> 01:24:59.544]  A woman in Chicago pulls up
[01:25:00.146 --> 01:25:03.668]  She's got her fourteen and ten-year-old daughters in the car.
[01:25:04.028 --> 01:25:05.209]  It's nine feet away.
[01:25:05.369 --> 01:25:08.251]  The Salvation Army can, the donation can.
[01:25:08.571 --> 01:25:12.894]  She puts 875 in it, is out of the car thirty seconds, locks the car, has the keys.
[01:25:13.354 --> 01:25:13.814]  It's running.
[01:25:13.834 --> 01:25:14.495]  It's freezing cold.
[01:25:14.975 --> 01:25:15.796]  Throws the money in.
[01:25:15.836 --> 01:25:17.377]  The police arrest her on the spot.
[01:25:17.397 --> 01:25:17.937]  Take her to jail.
[01:25:17.957 --> 01:25:18.437]  Take her kids.
[01:25:18.697 --> 01:25:19.338]  That was in the news.
[01:25:19.798 --> 01:25:23.140]  Or there's a guy in Detroit, no criminal record, top archaeologist.
[01:25:24.181 --> 01:25:25.582]  I think his son was eight years old.
[01:25:25.702 --> 01:25:26.582]  They order lemonade.
[01:25:26.702 --> 01:25:28.543]  They bring them hard lemonade.
[01:25:28.583 --> 01:25:29.404]  Looks like lemonade.
[01:25:30.555 --> 01:25:34.278]  Hard lemonade, his son takes one drink, arrested, CPS takes his kid.
[01:25:34.598 --> 01:25:36.680]  Because they brought the wrong lemonade, he didn't look.
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:42.684]  So my point is, the government's growing, the police state system's growing.
[01:25:43.144 --> 01:25:44.886]  It is looking for people to grab.
[01:25:46.227 --> 01:25:48.629]  You say anything to hide, let the repairman spy on me.
[01:25:49.149 --> 01:25:50.110]  You have privacy.
[01:25:50.550 --> 01:25:53.332]  See, the privacy's on your side to protect against tyranny.
[01:25:54.113 --> 01:25:59.877]  And so, you read a bill like this, Texas PC Repair now requires PI license,
[01:26:01.533 --> 01:26:10.720]  From its Texas Rangers to its enthusiastic take on the death penalty, the Lone Star State has long been known for its aggressive stance on law enforcement, thanks to a strange new law.
[01:26:11.781 --> 01:26:17.605]  It is a sting that may soon be felt by a number of state computer repair people.
[01:26:18.105 --> 01:26:28.373]  A recently passed law requires Texas computer repair technicians, and I read the law, that's what it says, have a private investigator's license, according to a story posted by the Dallas-Fort Worth CW affiliate.
[01:26:29.016 --> 01:26:35.099]  And it goes on, in order to obtain a license, technicians must receive a criminal justice degree or participate in a three-year apprenticeship.
[01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:38.221]  Those shops that refuse to participate will be forced to be shut down.
[01:26:38.601 --> 01:26:43.204]  Violators of the law can be hit with a $4,000 fine and up to a year in jail.
[01:26:43.244 --> 01:26:46.666]  Penalties that apply to customers who seek out their services.
[01:26:47.126 --> 01:26:50.648]  Some of the area's larger companies already employ technicians with PI licenses.
[01:26:51.008 --> 01:26:53.689]  A fact that generally doesn't apply to small computer repair shops.
[01:26:54.410 --> 01:26:54.570]  Now,
[01:26:56.883 --> 01:27:08.677]  All I know is, I have the Austin Newscast, and it's in my film Road to Tyranny, ads they run on TV where the kids get $200 credit cards and they have them report on their parents and ask them what's in the medicine cabinet.
[01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:19.944]  The extent of this is growing and getting worse, and they've recruited half a million truck drivers to spy on everybody in anti-terror training, but then it's anti-terror and crime.
[01:27:20.264 --> 01:27:25.046]  They've hired 26,000 preachers to spy on people and give sermons that say, submit to the government.
[01:27:25.246 --> 01:27:33.449]  They've got the InfraGard, 23,000 executives spying on people and been given shoot-to-kill orders of their order due to be deputized secret police.
[01:27:34.109 --> 01:27:35.210]  All of this is going on.
[01:27:35.490 --> 01:27:37.232]  Now, will this be enforced?
[01:27:38.453 --> 01:27:40.955]  Can we debate the interpretation of this law?
[01:27:41.095 --> 01:27:43.597]  Yes, but that is how it reads.
[01:27:44.017 --> 01:27:48.760]  Mike in Houston says that I'm wrong, and we'll find out why I'm wrong.
[01:27:49.041 --> 01:27:49.961]  I certainly hope I am.
[01:27:50.262 --> 01:27:53.224]  Mike, how are we wrong here reporting on this?
[01:27:53.864 --> 01:27:54.785]  Oh, hey, how's it going, Alex?
[01:27:55.165 --> 01:27:59.749]  You know, I've read all the articles and stuff, and I get very concerned because I'm a PC tech here in Houston, Texas, okay?
[01:28:00.405 --> 01:28:02.326]  Uh, so I sent this over to my attorney.
[01:28:02.366 --> 01:28:12.048]  I sent the actual House bill over to my attorney and he read through it and he said there's only two sections that pertain to people that deal with computers as far as the PI license holders law.
[01:28:12.908 --> 01:28:18.850]  And one of those, you know, is for data security specialists that are, you know, working on large enterprise networks.
[01:28:19.835 --> 01:28:25.699]  The other one has to do with if you're actually collecting information for a civil or criminal trial.
[01:28:26.439 --> 01:28:27.000]  All right, stay there.
[01:28:27.020 --> 01:28:28.440]  I want to hear about this on the other side.
[01:28:28.460 --> 01:28:28.861]  Hold on.
[01:28:29.221 --> 01:28:31.062]  I want to specifically hear about this when we get back.
[01:28:31.562 --> 01:28:34.504]  We'll be right back with his call, and I'm going to really try to hurry through your calls.
[01:28:34.924 --> 01:28:39.727]  Mike, Gary, Sam, Ed, Charles, many, many others.
[01:28:39.747 --> 01:28:41.328]  We're going to go really fast through your calls.
[01:28:41.689 --> 01:28:42.129]  Stay with us.
[01:28:51.249 --> 01:28:53.390]  Hey Bonnie, no more pickpocketing for us.
[01:28:53.670 --> 01:28:57.831]  I have an easier way we can steal people's credit cards without them even knowing they've been robbed.
[01:28:58.011 --> 01:28:59.112]  How so, Clyde?
[01:28:59.272 --> 01:29:02.033]  I have this RFID reader I picked up on the internet.
[01:29:02.213 --> 01:29:06.875]  Just by waving it near you, I can skim your credit card information while your cards are still in your purse.
[01:29:07.075 --> 01:29:07.575]  Just watch.
[01:29:08.223 --> 01:29:10.144]  Hey look, that's my info on the screen.
[01:29:10.284 --> 01:29:11.544]  You gotta be kidding me.
[01:29:11.784 --> 01:29:12.024]  Nope.
[01:29:12.164 --> 01:29:16.225]  With 50 million credit cards with hidden RFID chips, I figure we'll make a fortune.
[01:29:16.466 --> 01:29:18.666]  As long as people don't hear about Identity Stronghold.
[01:29:18.886 --> 01:29:19.206]  Why?
[01:29:19.406 --> 01:29:21.187]  What's Identity Stronghold?
[01:29:21.387 --> 01:29:22.708]  They make the Secure Sleeve.
[01:29:22.928 --> 01:29:26.469]  When people keep their credit cards in the shielded Secure Sleeve, I can't read them.
[01:29:26.509 --> 01:29:29.490]  Do a lot of people already know about the Secure Sleeve?
[01:29:29.610 --> 01:29:30.250]  No way.
[01:29:30.450 --> 01:29:33.811]  Most people don't realize they even have chips in their credit cards and passports.
[01:29:33.991 --> 01:29:36.613]  Clyde, we should get some of those secure sleeves.
[01:29:36.794 --> 01:29:37.674]  I already got some.
[01:29:37.855 --> 01:29:39.536]  I also got some to fit our passports.
[01:29:39.756 --> 01:29:44.481]  Identity Stronghold has secure sleeves for sale right on the internet at IDStronghold.com.

[01:29:54.548 --> 01:30:04.637]  Last month, Ready Reserve Foods stated that by fall, food would be in short supply and the government would be forced to impose controls on food and food distribution because of civil unrest and panic.
[01:30:05.558 --> 01:30:09.181]  Well, the floods in the heartland of America have all but assured this will happen.
[01:30:09.742 --> 01:30:15.707]  It is estimated that 5 million acres of farmland will not be producing over 700 million bushels of corn alone.
[01:30:16.548 --> 01:30:19.969]  If you've ever thought about storing food, now is the time to do so.

[01:31:00.378 --> 01:31:08.562]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[01:31:51.184 --> 01:31:53.105]  Oh, what a beautiful day for the beach.
[01:31:53.606 --> 01:31:57.188]  Look, up there in the sky, it's Non-X-Man.
[01:31:57.828 --> 01:31:58.949]  He's in a dive.
[01:31:59.509 --> 01:32:01.470]  He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach.
[01:32:02.010 --> 01:32:02.731]  Let's go look.
[01:32:03.311 --> 01:32:06.573]  I'm Non-X-Man, and your toenails need Non-X nail gel.
[01:32:07.133 --> 01:32:08.474]  Stop hiding them in the sand.
[01:32:08.994 --> 01:32:09.434]  Take them out.
[01:32:09.915 --> 01:32:10.535]  Let's see them.
[01:32:12.916 --> 01:32:15.037]  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
[01:32:15.357 --> 01:32:15.878]  Don't worry.
[01:32:16.398 --> 01:32:17.739]  Now there's Non-X nail gel.
[01:32:18.219 --> 01:32:22.301]  Use it on your toenails regularly, and they'll look fantastic in sandals.
[01:32:22.941 --> 01:32:25.223]  Oh, I will, Non-X-Man.
[01:32:25.563 --> 01:32:25.843]  Great.
[01:32:26.403 --> 01:32:29.245]  Well, I'm off to find more ugly toenails.
[01:32:31.496 --> 01:32:34.137]  Don't let Nonox Man find you with unsightly toenails.
[01:32:34.597 --> 01:32:38.059]  Buy diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed Nonox Nail Gel.
[01:32:38.599 --> 01:32:49.763]  It's in the foot care aisle at Supercenters, Walgreens, CVS, Long's, Meijer, Giant Eagle, Car Drug, Snyder's, Duane Reade, Bilo, and Rite Aid.

[01:33:15.607 --> 01:33:17.269]  Headline!
[01:33:17.349 --> 01:33:18.109]  Ron Paul!
[01:33:18.229 --> 01:33:27.037]  I hear members of Congress saying, if we could only nuke Iran, said that Thursday on my weekday show.
[01:33:28.898 --> 01:33:32.201]  Cover more of that before the end of this broadcast.
[01:33:33.778 --> 01:33:36.141]  Also, they want to register knives in England.
[01:33:36.162 --> 01:33:39.967]  Okay, let's go back to Mike in Houston.
[01:33:40.608 --> 01:33:43.491]  He's saying it's limited groups of computer repair people.
[01:33:43.772 --> 01:33:45.915]  And yes, I see that language.
[01:33:47.426 --> 01:33:48.767]  And that's how they're interpreting it.
[01:33:48.787 --> 01:34:04.633]  But if you read the full language, this is basically them now recruiting large numbers of computer snoops and trying to force large cadres of PC repair people, computer repair people, into this.
[01:34:04.693 --> 01:34:05.974]  But you're saying you disagree.
[01:34:06.254 --> 01:34:10.335]  But, I don't know, five different publications that are computer publications disagree with you.
[01:34:10.455 --> 01:34:15.237]  I read the bill, and I can certainly see the angle you're at, but I know how government operates.
[01:34:15.538 --> 01:34:16.498]  Go ahead and finish up, Mike.
[01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:18.260]  Oh yeah, hey Alex.
[01:34:18.780 --> 01:34:19.480]  Uh, well, hey again.
[01:34:19.841 --> 01:34:23.802]  Yeah, I sent it over to my attorney and had him look it up and down, you know, because it really concerns me.
[01:34:23.822 --> 01:34:33.404]  It affects my business, you know, very heavily, so I had him look at it and he's like, you know, there's nothing in there to compel me for what I do as far as repairing, you know, hardware and software to do anything like that.
[01:34:34.224 --> 01:34:46.367]  Um, yeah, he said basically if I get put into a role of security, uh, you know, as far as, you know, for non-public data that I would then have to be licensed, or if I was to actually start doing, like, you know, review and analysis of, you know,
[01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:52.903]  Computer information for criminal or civil court cases, but other than that, you know, it's not necessary.
[01:34:52.923 --> 01:34:53.943]  Well, let me ask you this.
[01:34:53.963 --> 01:34:57.605]  I mean, do you own your own company or do you work for a company?
[01:34:58.265 --> 01:34:58.506]  Both.
[01:34:59.246 --> 01:35:00.046]  I do both.
[01:35:00.086 --> 01:35:03.268]  I do on the side of my own company and I work for a business.
[01:35:03.848 --> 01:35:05.329]  Well, I mean, how does it work?
[01:35:05.389 --> 01:35:14.473]  Because you see in the news all the time people take their computers in for repair and they get in trouble for gambling or they get in trouble for a picture of their two-year-old walking around with their diapers half down.
[01:35:14.493 --> 01:35:16.094]  I mean, how does that work?
[01:35:16.826 --> 01:35:33.302]  Well, you know, actually part of that law, part of the law that we're actually discussing protects individuals a little bit more when they're bringing their computer to the repair shop because that repair technician, if they go and snoop on your computer, they're actually engaging in illegal review and analysis of data.
[01:35:33.923 --> 01:35:39.408]  So they would actually be charged with a criminal offense for not having a PI license when they're reviewing and analyzing data.
[01:35:40.107 --> 01:35:50.052]  Um, and the Fourth Amendment should actually protect those people that bring their computer in, because they're not asking to leave any privacy, unless they start giving up passwords and that kind of thing.
[01:35:50.072 --> 01:35:55.315]  But you see the cases, you see the cases, uh, where they're going through everybody's computers.
[01:35:55.935 --> 01:35:57.376]  I mean, that's all over the place.
[01:35:57.976 --> 01:36:01.498]  You know, they put out so much... You know, I mean, exactly.
[01:36:01.878 --> 01:36:07.861]  But, I mean, you know that, uh, law enforcement, no longer peace officer, but law enforcement agencies,
[01:36:08.231 --> 01:36:10.573]  Recruit all sorts of service people to spy.
[01:36:11.353 --> 01:36:12.694]  Oh yeah, I'm sure they do.
[01:36:13.055 --> 01:36:15.096]  I've never been approached for it, but I'm sure that they do.
[01:36:15.296 --> 01:36:17.898]  Especially at higher levels, when you have big companies.
[01:36:17.998 --> 01:36:18.979]  I'm sure that they do.
[01:36:19.299 --> 01:36:20.680]  Alright, good to hear from you.
[01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:23.182]  I'm going to get some expert guests on about that.
[01:36:23.582 --> 01:36:28.566]  And we're going to get to the bottom of this, because I find it bizarre that five different publications would say one thing.
[01:36:28.966 --> 01:36:29.807]  I read it, and
[01:36:31.174 --> 01:36:34.057]  It looks like they can interpret it for that, but we're certainly going to find out.
[01:36:34.777 --> 01:36:38.020]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ed in New York.
[01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:39.361]  You're on the air, Ed.
[01:36:39.421 --> 01:36:39.761]  Welcome.
[01:36:40.622 --> 01:36:41.082]  Hello, Alex.
[01:36:41.323 --> 01:36:41.843]  How are you, sir?
[01:36:41.963 --> 01:36:42.183]  Good.
[01:36:42.223 --> 01:36:42.804]  Thanks for calling.
[01:36:44.065 --> 01:36:46.087]  First of all, I just want to thank you for all your work.
[01:36:46.467 --> 01:36:53.893]  I want to thank you for personally breaking me away from this huge matrix that we exist in.
[01:36:54.877 --> 01:36:56.458]  Truth Rising, I saw it yesterday.
[01:36:56.478 --> 01:36:57.259]  Incredible film.
[01:36:57.319 --> 01:36:58.659]  Everyone needs to see this film.
[01:36:58.999 --> 01:37:00.840]  I actually brought a couple of tears to my eyes.
[01:37:02.461 --> 01:37:06.804]  You touched on this global warming scam earlier with a previous caller.
[01:37:07.624 --> 01:37:13.427]  Al Gore, as far as you know with your research, what does he stand to gain?
[01:37:13.647 --> 01:37:19.531]  Why was he pushed to the forefront as this so-called high priest of this
[01:37:22.813 --> 01:37:30.856]  Well, number one, Al Gore owns a large oil company, has the controlling stock in it, given to him by his father, Albert Gore Sr., the former senator.
[01:37:31.617 --> 01:37:36.338]  Al Gore has also bought in to the Carbon Credits Global Exchange.
[01:37:36.378 --> 01:37:37.279]  It's a private group.
[01:37:37.579 --> 01:37:40.540]  You will buy your carbon credits for being a human, for breathing.
[01:37:40.940 --> 01:37:44.962]  They are saying the gas you exhale, that plants breathe, is a toxic waste.
[01:37:45.482 --> 01:37:52.685]  And as the Club of Rome documents written by Richard N. Haas, head of the CFR State, that is then a way to regulate and control your life.
[01:37:53.245 --> 01:37:57.107]  Also, it takes over the larger environmental movement that means well.
[01:37:57.887 --> 01:38:11.573]  I mean, I don't like the fact that lawn fertilizer, they are allowed under law, they passed 10 years ago, I didn't know about this, my dad told me about it this weekend, I looked it up, to dump toxic waste basically into the fertilizer.
[01:38:11.633 --> 01:38:14.954]  I mean, just hundreds of horrible things, and then that's put on your lawn,
[01:38:15.441 --> 01:38:16.421]  Your pets absorb it.
[01:38:16.481 --> 01:38:17.142]  You absorb it.
[01:38:17.222 --> 01:38:18.682]  It runs off into aquifers.
[01:38:19.122 --> 01:38:23.164]  I mean, there's thousands of serious environmental things that are happening.
[01:38:23.304 --> 01:38:27.445]  Or coal-fired plants burning dirty coal, filled with mercury that we then breathe.
[01:38:27.725 --> 01:38:28.405]  That hurts us.
[01:38:28.646 --> 01:38:35.488]  But see, you're not going to hear about any of the real environmental things that are going on, or cross-species genetic engineering that causes major problems.
[01:38:35.848 --> 01:38:41.350]  It's all, no, let's have a global tax, and we'll buy credits from the private central banks.
[01:38:42.216 --> 01:38:48.160]  Which now just doesn't let them control the fiat currency, which they can then debase and control us with what they're doing now.
[01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:58.487]  Now they trade in what humans breathe, what all animals breathe, and then they falsely list one of the four life-giving elements of the planet.
[01:39:00.108 --> 01:39:01.589]  And by elements I mean ingredients.
[01:39:02.029 --> 01:39:02.510]  Sunlight,
[01:39:03.110 --> 01:39:04.731]  Solar radiation, okay.
[01:39:04.851 --> 01:39:07.412]  Water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide.
[01:39:07.892 --> 01:39:10.372]  Those are the four ingredients.
[01:39:11.233 --> 01:39:16.955]  And, I mean, have you seen the TV programs where they walk up to citizens and give them the scientific name of water?
[01:39:17.335 --> 01:39:17.555]  Yeah.
[01:39:17.735 --> 01:39:19.035]  And then say, should we ban this?
[01:39:19.115 --> 01:39:23.397]  And all of them, almost all, say, and I've done this myself, yes, ban it.
[01:39:24.397 --> 01:39:27.218]  Because you're giving them the scientific name for water.
[01:39:27.876 --> 01:39:28.056]  Right.
[01:39:28.877 --> 01:39:30.597]  One last question, just switching gears.
[01:39:31.098 --> 01:39:34.019]  Living in New York, I have a 10-year-old daughter, and this concerns me greatly.
[01:39:34.039 --> 01:39:41.102]  New York trying to make it law to make vaccines mandatory.
[01:39:41.122 --> 01:39:42.823]  Do you happen to have an update on that?
[01:39:43.123 --> 01:39:43.884]  Well, let's be clear.
[01:39:44.024 --> 01:39:48.886]  Now, see, listeners everywhere, new listeners, whether they're listening in Austin or Kansas City right now,
[01:39:49.721 --> 01:39:55.470]  Places like KCAA and San Diego, they're saying, well I thought vaccines are the law.
[01:39:55.610 --> 01:39:58.114]  I hear it on the news every year before school starts.
[01:39:58.214 --> 01:39:58.415]  No.
[01:39:58.735 --> 01:40:03.543]  There is no law anywhere in the US that anyone has to take inoculations.
[01:40:04.335 --> 01:40:10.639]  Okay, but then if you don't have them, they'll kick you out of school and then arrest you for truancy.
[01:40:10.979 --> 01:40:22.786]  But, that's a fraud because the school, by law, can't kick you out for that, so they're fraudulently kicking you out of school and then triggering criminal penalties to go after you.
[01:40:22.806 --> 01:40:23.306]  So you're right.
[01:40:23.626 --> 01:40:30.090]  New Jersey and New York are trying to pass laws to make over 50 plus vaccines
[01:40:30.788 --> 01:40:32.109]  Absolutely.
[01:40:59.164 --> 01:41:00.565]  Thank you, sir.
[01:41:00.745 --> 01:41:03.367]  I just want to thank you again and keep up the good fight.
[01:41:03.387 --> 01:41:03.907]  Thank you very much.
[01:41:04.248 --> 01:41:04.688]  Thank you.
[01:41:05.148 --> 01:41:06.049]  And folks, don't believe me.
[01:41:06.069 --> 01:41:07.430]  There's no law you have to take vaccines.
[01:41:07.450 --> 01:41:08.311]  Check and do it for yourself.
[01:41:10.592 --> 01:41:12.073]  Let's go ahead and take some more calls here.
[01:41:12.934 --> 01:41:17.497]  Let's go ahead and talk to Gary in New Orleans.
[01:41:17.517 --> 01:41:18.798]  You're on the air, Gary.
[01:41:19.819 --> 01:41:20.980]  Hey, Alex.
[01:41:21.340 --> 01:41:23.482]  I'm a Prison Planet subscriber and
[01:41:24.284 --> 01:41:39.796]  Me and my girlfriend, a couple of girlfriends of hers, were watching it last night and towards the end they had sort of like tears in their eyes and then you grab your bullhorn and they all jumped up like you scored a touchdown and started screaming so I started playing guitar to be cool so I might have to give me a bullhorn to be cool these days.
[01:41:40.317 --> 01:41:45.040]  But anyway... Well that's a lot cooler than wearing a bunch of bling, so you know.
[01:41:45.401 --> 01:41:52.226]  Yeah, well um, what I wanted to, um, I had a couple of questions about Blackwater coming into our city and also the price of the, um,
[01:41:52.904 --> 01:42:17.836]  Gas in Mexico, but something else that I really wanted to talk to you about is I was in Dealey Plaza about six months ago when Nelly Carly had passed away and I was standing on a triple overpass and I was taking a picture of this Texas State flag at half-mast and it was kind of dark and when I developed it, I don't know if you know this or not, but there's totally a pyramid overlooking Dealey Plaza.
[01:42:17.896 --> 01:42:19.257]  Oh yeah, the whole thing's Masonic.
[01:42:19.867 --> 01:42:21.048]  Whole things with Sonic, yeah.
[01:42:21.208 --> 01:42:22.088]  So you knew about that?
[01:42:22.208 --> 01:42:22.469]  Yes.
[01:42:22.789 --> 01:42:24.750]  Well, it's hard to bring up something you might know about.
[01:42:24.990 --> 01:42:26.291]  Send me the photo, we'll post it.
[01:42:26.551 --> 01:42:27.031]  Anything else?
[01:42:28.032 --> 01:42:31.274]  I wanted to find out, um, could you explain or elaborate?
[01:42:31.994 --> 01:42:37.298]  In other words, no one knows it was Blackwater that came into our city during, um, you know, Katrina.
[01:42:37.338 --> 01:42:38.238]  Did you witness that?
[01:42:39.279 --> 01:42:41.040]  Um, I didn't, but many of my people did.
[01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:42.040]  I was in the heart of this area.
[01:42:42.060 --> 01:42:43.621]  I'll tell you what, stay there, I want to hear more about it.
[01:42:43.942 --> 01:42:45.883]  But John Hull will come right back and talk about that.
[01:42:46.143 --> 01:42:47.304]  It's already the final segment.
[01:42:47.584 --> 01:42:49.205]  Hard to believe, we must ban
[01:42:50.174 --> 01:42:57.055]  This evil chemical dia... Imagine walking down the street and hearing footsteps behind you.
[01:42:57.496 --> 01:43:01.616]  They get closer and closer, and suddenly you have a sense something bad is going to happen.

[01:44:51.618 --> 01:44:54.219]  Listener, ask yourself, can I be deceived?
[01:44:54.520 --> 01:44:56.320]  Matthew 24 states four times.
[01:44:56.581 --> 01:44:58.702]  In the last days, many will be deceived.
[01:44:58.922 --> 01:45:02.204]  There are many ideas about the mark of the beast and the Antichrist.
[01:45:02.484 --> 01:45:05.885]  What do you know about the beast, its mark, and the Antichrist?
[01:45:06.246 --> 01:45:09.828]  Is the beast a superpower nation or a giant computer in Belgium?
[01:45:10.168 --> 01:45:14.210]  Is its mark an implanted chip, a tattoo, the national ID card, or 666?
[01:45:15.451 --> 01:45:18.072]  Is the Antichrist a person, title, or both?
[01:45:18.412 --> 01:45:20.033]  Some believe these things are in the future.
[01:45:20.333 --> 01:45:21.814]  Others believe that it's in the past.
[01:45:22.334 --> 01:45:25.356]  1 John states, the Antichrist is already in the world.
[01:45:25.617 --> 01:45:26.297]  What is the truth?
[01:45:26.537 --> 01:45:27.498]  And what is a lie?
[01:45:27.758 --> 01:45:29.799]  Are you willing to search God's Word for the truth?
[01:45:30.100 --> 01:45:31.901]  Friends, these answers are in the Bible.

[01:46:57.087 --> 01:46:58.307]  Well, search no more.
[01:46:58.347 --> 01:47:00.609]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:47:06.112 --> 01:47:08.273]  All right, let's move fast here.
[01:47:08.653 --> 01:47:09.394]  Final segment.
[01:47:09.454 --> 01:47:11.355]  I want to hit some of this Iranda before we end it.
[01:47:12.483 --> 01:47:16.666]  Gary in New Orleans was telling the story about Blackwater.
[01:47:16.686 --> 01:47:19.848]  Yeah, they sent the FBI in to video this.
[01:47:19.928 --> 01:47:20.689]  It was on the news.
[01:47:21.930 --> 01:47:25.452]  ABC News announced, yes, they're confiscating all the guns, even in the unflooded areas.
[01:47:25.512 --> 01:47:29.455]  They went into multi-million dollar homes and took their guns and they never got them back.
[01:47:30.456 --> 01:47:36.660]  And Blackwater was there with the FBI leading police in for the gun confiscation.
[01:47:38.044 --> 01:48:00.956]  uh... they would stack the aid up to, that family that was there, outside of the uh... Superdome and wouldn't let it in and then uh... FEMA just basically sat there and then they said oh look we screwed up now we need even more funding and power that was by design so pretty amazing but uh... yes Blackwater Blackwater Worldwide they're now not a U.S.
[01:48:00.996 --> 01:48:02.177]  company they left the U.S.
[01:48:02.197 --> 01:48:07.280]  but still their wood red white and blue we need mercenaries that's what's good that's what made America great
[01:48:08.181 --> 01:48:08.901]  Oh yeah, I love it.
[01:48:09.281 --> 01:48:12.542]  Let's go ahead and go back to Gary.
[01:48:12.982 --> 01:48:14.523]  Anything else you wanted to add on that, Gary?
[01:48:15.103 --> 01:48:22.425]  Yeah, it seems like our city was surrounded by do-gooders, churches, Walmart seemed like they could handle the whole thing on their own.
[01:48:22.445 --> 01:48:23.085]  They were blocked.
[01:48:23.125 --> 01:48:27.526]  The government had to show us that they need more power by screwing it up by design.
[01:48:27.886 --> 01:48:29.727]  FEMA cut the communication lines.
[01:48:29.807 --> 01:48:34.328]  Our Sheriff Harry Lee had to post guards there, said shoot anybody that comes in and cut them again.
[01:48:34.668 --> 01:48:39.432]  But I'm telling you today, I look out my window, I'm in Lakeview, there's military police going by all the time.
[01:48:39.452 --> 01:48:39.893]  Of course!
[01:48:40.273 --> 01:48:47.359]  It is a model city, a training city, to train the military and police to work together and to get rid of posse comitatus.
[01:48:47.379 --> 01:48:48.340]  We have all the documents.
[01:48:48.740 --> 01:48:52.964]  It's in my Police State Films on DVD, available at InfoWars.com.
[01:48:52.984 --> 01:48:55.866]  Listen, for those that don't know, Truth Rising is out.
[01:48:55.906 --> 01:49:02.732]  You can watch it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv or go to InfoWars.com and get the film on DVD, the highest quality.
[01:49:03.212 --> 01:49:06.313]  Uh, but this is a cinema verite, which in French means the cinema of truth.
[01:49:06.333 --> 01:49:08.813]  Uh, there is no voiceover, no nothing.
[01:49:09.133 --> 01:49:10.733]  People are saying this is my best film.
[01:49:10.753 --> 01:49:11.273]  What do you think?
[01:49:12.074 --> 01:49:12.994]  Uh, no doubt about it.
[01:49:13.074 --> 01:49:16.394]  I mean, the girls who were sitting on the sofa were just, um, riveted.
[01:49:16.434 --> 01:49:17.915]  They just couldn't believe what was going on.
[01:49:17.935 --> 01:49:19.895]  They didn't know anything about the people being sick.
[01:49:20.655 --> 01:49:27.716]  Um, they, and like I said, when you grab the bullhorn, they were jumping, they jumped up and yeah, it was almost like, you know, the Superbowl touchdown.
[01:49:27.896 --> 01:49:28.196]  Awesome.
[01:49:28.216 --> 01:49:32.417]  We'll see those instincts to get excited are misappropriated and
[01:49:34.704 --> 01:49:35.725]  I'm not saying sports are bad.
[01:49:35.745 --> 01:49:38.227]  I'm saying people get so war-like over sports.
[01:49:38.608 --> 01:49:41.010]  Excitement is meant about standing up against tyranny.
[01:49:41.410 --> 01:49:43.772]  That's what all those primitive feelings are all about.
[01:49:44.493 --> 01:49:57.505]  But yes, Truth Rising is out and it covers the first responders, how they covered up the dust, covers how the attacks were staged, bombs in the buildings, police and firemen, emergency workers admitting it on tape, that they knew the feds did it.
[01:49:58.495 --> 01:50:00.136]  Hey, how's it going Alex?
[01:50:19.489 --> 01:50:28.153]  Yeah, I just want to say, man, Truth Rising is definitely the best film yet, maybe the best film ever done about the 9-11 movement.
[01:50:28.254 --> 01:50:29.834]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:50:29.954 --> 01:50:34.737]  Well, it's about 9-11 truth, it's about the first responders, and the government knew the dust was going to kill them.
[01:50:35.017 --> 01:50:40.440]  Thousands have died, 50-plus thousand are dying, and that's about a third of it.
[01:50:40.940 --> 01:50:48.944]  Another third is the activism, taking over media events, the people standing up and fighting, and the other third is proof of how the globalists carried out the attacks.
[01:50:49.949 --> 01:50:53.290]  Hey, can I say, uh, the last caller, he might have been lying, man.
[01:50:53.670 --> 01:50:56.391]  Cause it wasn't just a girl's crying, man.
[01:50:56.471 --> 01:50:59.372]  I had a little tear in my eye myself, man.
[01:50:59.912 --> 01:51:02.433]  It was rough to see, uh... Well, listen, you're awesome.
[01:51:02.473 --> 01:51:03.193]  I gotta move fast.
[01:51:03.233 --> 01:51:03.813]  Thank you, sir.
[01:51:04.153 --> 01:51:06.514]  No, and it's meant to be upsetting, cause it's the truth.
[01:51:07.354 --> 01:51:08.815]  And, uh, that's the great part about it.
[01:51:08.955 --> 01:51:11.295]  It's such high quality on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:51:11.696 --> 01:51:15.037]  We ran it into our big screen television we have for editing.
[01:51:15.057 --> 01:51:19.678]  You know, it's like a 40-something inch plasma screen, so we can really check the quality of the films when we shoot in high def.
[01:51:20.416 --> 01:51:23.958]  You can run the computer feed of the highest quality, and it looks pretty good.
[01:51:24.278 --> 01:51:30.462]  I mean, even on a big-screen TV blown up, it doesn't look like, you know, as good as, you know, regular high-def TV, but it looks good.
[01:51:30.802 --> 01:51:32.423]  Now, the DVD, it looks awesome, folks.
[01:51:32.443 --> 01:51:34.264]  These are shot on high-quality cameras.
[01:51:35.105 --> 01:51:36.926]  Let's go ahead and talk to Sam in Germany.
[01:51:37.186 --> 01:51:38.066]  I would have gone to him earlier.
[01:51:38.086 --> 01:51:40.988]  I forgot we had somebody holding from Germany, probably on his dime.
[01:51:41.288 --> 01:51:42.029]  Sam, you're on the air.
[01:51:43.246 --> 01:51:44.667]  Hey Alex, how are you doing, sir?
[01:51:45.347 --> 01:51:57.234]  I was calling, I wanted to kind of gather, or know what you'd gathered from maybe Bob Chapman or Ray McGovern on how the effect of a collapse of the dollar and a collapse of the U.S.
[01:51:57.314 --> 01:52:03.317]  economy, how that's going to affect some of the economic strongholds here in Western Europe, per se, Germany, for example.
[01:52:03.437 --> 01:52:12.342]  A global dollar meltdown is already causing, see people say, well is it speculation driving up oil and gold and every other commodity, corn, wheat?
[01:52:12.782 --> 01:52:13.062]  Right.
[01:52:41.795 --> 01:52:41.975]  Right.
[01:52:42.316 --> 01:52:47.421]  And I mean, it's already hurting European manufacturing, it's already hurting tourism because people in the U.S.
[01:52:47.741 --> 01:52:49.683]  can't, you know, it's twice as much or more.
[01:52:50.084 --> 01:52:58.673]  I mean, Europe's already reeling, the globe is going into a deep recession, and if it continues for more than three quarters unabated, that is called a depression.
[01:52:58.693 --> 01:53:01.055]  Oh man, that's not gonna be good.
[01:53:02.105 --> 01:53:02.685]  Yeah, it's okay.
[01:53:02.725 --> 01:53:03.326]  Well, thanks Alex.
[01:53:03.386 --> 01:53:05.707]  I just wanted to say real quick to give you a shout-out.
[01:53:05.787 --> 01:53:08.609]  I give a shout-out from InfoKrieg.tv here.
[01:53:08.729 --> 01:53:12.332]  And, you know, truth is also rising here in Europe, and there's a lot of Germans.
[01:53:12.352 --> 01:53:13.632]  I really appreciate what you're doing, man.
[01:53:13.712 --> 01:53:15.233]  So, thanks, and keep it up, patriot.
[01:53:15.434 --> 01:53:15.814]  You bet.
[01:53:15.854 --> 01:53:18.235]  Yeah, there's... it's not my website, but it's a good website.
[01:53:18.596 --> 01:53:20.777]  InfoKrieg, I believe it's .com.
[01:53:20.817 --> 01:53:23.479]  It means InfoWar.com in Deutsch.
[01:53:23.959 --> 01:53:24.839]  I appreciate that.
[01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:25.480]  Yeah, no, there's...
[01:53:26.345 --> 01:53:29.546]  I've seen tens of thousands of views of my films just on German YouTube.
[01:53:30.226 --> 01:53:34.628]  Let's go ahead and talk to Lindsey in Idaho.
[01:53:34.688 --> 01:53:35.808]  You're on the air, Lindsey.
[01:53:35.908 --> 01:53:36.948]  Oh, I went to the wrong line.
[01:53:37.028 --> 01:53:37.608]  No, no, that's right.
[01:53:37.909 --> 01:53:38.569]  Lindsey, go ahead.
[01:53:39.209 --> 01:53:39.509]  Hello?
[01:53:39.749 --> 01:53:40.069]  Hi.
[01:53:40.569 --> 01:53:44.411]  Yeah, I just wanted to say, number one, your new movie is exceptional.
[01:53:45.271 --> 01:53:46.631]  Do me a favor, turn that radio off.
[01:53:46.891 --> 01:53:47.231]  Got it.
[01:53:47.572 --> 01:53:51.213]  Only because I want to give you full, you know, all the coverage here.
[01:53:51.253 --> 01:53:51.533]  Go ahead.
[01:53:51.793 --> 01:53:52.273]  It's off.
[01:53:52.353 --> 01:53:55.294]  Okay, anyway, truth rising, exceptional movie.
[01:53:56.068 --> 01:54:03.031]  Secondly, you had one article about a thing that happened about an hour from where I live, the Rainbow Festival.
[01:54:03.551 --> 01:54:08.973]  Yes, you've got thousands of peaceful people being SWAT teamed, and I heard they were attacked again this year.
[01:54:08.993 --> 01:54:20.898]  It just, it fascinates me that for 30 some odd years these people have been meeting together, not causing any trouble, and now why all of a sudden are they a problem?
[01:54:21.664 --> 01:54:32.016]  Well, the public has to be shown who's boss, and that we're slaves, and we've got to be bossed around and taught how to cow down, and that the red, white, and blue means licking boots of a black uniformed officer.
[01:54:35.416 --> 01:54:37.278]  They're basically really good people.
[01:54:37.338 --> 01:54:39.880]  They have some good ideals, some good ideas.
[01:54:40.180 --> 01:54:40.420]  No, no.
[01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:42.782]  They've never had problems at the Rainbow Gatherings.
[01:54:42.802 --> 01:54:42.922]  Never!
[01:54:43.483 --> 01:54:45.605]  And I'm told they're pretty neat.
[01:54:46.345 --> 01:54:47.366]  I was invited to one.
[01:54:47.406 --> 01:54:49.228]  I lived in Wyoming for several years.
[01:54:49.288 --> 01:54:53.331]  Well, how dare citizens go out in the middle of national lands and...
[01:54:54.592 --> 01:54:55.293]  And get together.
[01:54:55.313 --> 01:54:56.574]  I mean, how dare you?
[01:54:56.614 --> 01:54:57.334]  You don't do that.
[01:54:57.374 --> 01:54:58.215]  That's not freedom.
[01:54:58.575 --> 01:55:03.459]  Freedom is about being taxed and regulated and bossed around, and it's about being a slave.
[01:55:04.120 --> 01:55:15.949]  It just, like I said, I thought it was very sad, but it was a great article to have to try and make people aware of the fact that no matter how simple you are, it's just not good enough.
[01:55:16.409 --> 01:55:28.534]  Yeah, the article is out of the Jackson Hole Star Tribune, and the headline, Police Attack Rainbow Family Gathering in Wyoming, and even the local paper admits they just attacked them, pointed weapons.
[01:55:28.554 --> 01:55:31.676]  I've seen online videos last year where they run up and put guns to kids.
[01:55:32.236 --> 01:55:33.657]  This is from the local paper.
[01:55:49.282 --> 01:55:50.523]  Yeah, it's the Wind River Reservation, correct.
[01:56:10.661 --> 01:56:22.587]  And it says, the camp on Forest Service land around the county every year, but the Rainbow family's non-hierarchical methods, no one can speak to the Rainbows, much less sign a land permit, often have stymied their relationships.
[01:56:22.887 --> 01:56:24.888]  But rarely do tensions escalate into violence.
[01:56:25.369 --> 01:56:32.172]  And it says, the Forest Service Incident Command Team in Rock Springs issued a press release Friday morning saying, officers, we're trolling the Maine meadow gathering.
[01:56:32.532 --> 01:56:33.533]  So I appreciate your call.
[01:56:33.553 --> 01:56:35.614]  I gotta get, you know, I don't know if I can get these final callers in.
[01:56:35.634 --> 01:56:36.174]  We'll try.
[01:56:37.154 --> 01:56:39.896]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Ohio.
[01:56:40.336 --> 01:56:43.158]  Hello, how are you doing?
[01:56:43.218 --> 01:56:50.462]  Hey, Alex, I just wanted to tell you that it's an absolutely fabulous film.
[01:56:51.803 --> 01:56:54.244]  Watching old Ziggy up there really turned my stomach.
[01:56:54.745 --> 01:56:55.565]  Remember him, right?
[01:56:55.645 --> 01:56:56.446]  Ziggy Brzezinski?
[01:56:56.526 --> 01:56:56.806]  Yes.
[01:56:57.506 --> 01:56:57.867]  Alright.
[01:56:58.467 --> 01:57:04.451]  And I also, the reason I wanted to call and congratulate you on the film was to ask if you had seen
[01:57:05.655 --> 01:57:09.438]  Lindsey Williams' talk.
[01:57:09.798 --> 01:57:11.019]  The energy non-crisis.
[01:57:11.480 --> 01:57:16.544]  Yes, there's more oil in one area of Alaska than all of Saudi Arabia.
[01:57:16.964 --> 01:57:18.886]  The liberals aren't stopping it from flowing.
[01:57:18.926 --> 01:57:21.768]  They're little well-meaning idiots.
[01:57:22.635 --> 01:57:24.617]  The big oil companies, we have their documents.
[01:57:24.677 --> 01:57:25.698]  It's been in the mainstream news.
[01:57:26.039 --> 01:57:27.200]  Don't want that oil flowing.
[01:57:27.220 --> 01:57:28.041]  There's too much oil.
[01:57:28.301 --> 01:57:29.402]  They want to keep prices up.
[01:57:29.722 --> 01:57:30.864]  God bless you all!
[01:57:31.244 --> 01:57:33.486]  We'll see you next Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:57:33.526 --> 01:57:33.907]  Take care.
[01:57:34.207 --> 01:57:35.789]  And, oh, and Truth Rising's out.
[01:57:35.829 --> 01:57:37.590]  Check it out at InfoWars.com.

[01:58:12.133 --> 01:58:14.613]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[01:58:15.074 --> 01:58:16.974]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[01:58:17.694 --> 01:58:20.855]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[01:58:21.515 --> 01:58:27.976]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[01:58:28.756 --> 01:58:30.976]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[01:58:31.337 --> 01:58:31.777]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:58:31.837 --> 01:58:33.277]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:58:41.658 --> 01:58:43.781]  Hey Bonnie, no more pickpocketing for us.
[01:58:44.061 --> 01:58:48.226]  I have an easier way we can steal people's credit cards without them even knowing they've been robbed.
[01:58:48.386 --> 01:58:49.487]  How so, Clyde?
[01:58:49.667 --> 01:58:52.410]  I have this RFID reader I picked up on the internet.
[01:58:52.611 --> 01:58:57.256]  Just by waving it near you, I can skim your credit card information while your cards are still in your purse.
[01:58:57.456 --> 01:58:57.977]  Just watch.
[01:58:58.618 --> 01:59:00.519]  Hey look, that's my info on the screen.
[01:59:00.679 --> 01:59:01.919]  You gotta be kidding me.
[01:59:02.159 --> 01:59:02.379]  Nope.
[01:59:02.539 --> 01:59:06.600]  With 50 million credit cards with hidden RFID chips, I figure we'll make a fortune.
[01:59:06.841 --> 01:59:09.041]  As long as people don't hear about Identity Stronghold.
[01:59:09.261 --> 01:59:09.601]  Why?
[01:59:09.801 --> 01:59:11.562]  What's Identity Stronghold?
[01:59:11.762 --> 01:59:13.083]  They make the Secure Sleeve.
[01:59:13.303 --> 01:59:16.844]  When people keep their credit cards in the shielded Secure Sleeve, I can't read them.
[01:59:16.904 --> 01:59:19.865]  Do a lot of people already know about the Secure Sleeve?
[01:59:19.985 --> 01:59:20.605]  No way.
[01:59:20.825 --> 01:59:24.206]  Most people don't realize they even have chips in their credit cards and passports.
[01:59:24.386 --> 01:59:27.008]  Clyde, we should get some of those secure sleeves.
[01:59:27.168 --> 01:59:28.049]  I already got some.
[01:59:28.229 --> 01:59:29.910]  I also got some to fit our passports.
[01:59:30.150 --> 01:59:34.853]  Identity Stronghold has secure sleeves for sale right on the internet at IDStronghold.com.
[01:59:35.134 --> 01:59:36.755]  IDStronghold.com?
[01:59:36.975 --> 01:59:37.315]  Right.

[01:59:38.696 --> 01:59:40.497]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:40.517 --> 01:59:46.322]  Home to hard-hitting talk radio.
