[00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:01.450]  You're listening to GCN.
[00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:29.983]  Watch, it's four o'clock.
[00:00:33.846 --> 00:00:36.928]  IRN USA Radio News, I'm Pete LaValle.
[00:00:36.988 --> 00:00:42.934]  It could be a lousy drive home for most holiday travelers along the East Coast and the Great Lakes region.
[00:00:43.074 --> 00:00:44.735]  So says the National Weather Service.
[00:00:45.035 --> 00:00:55.224]  Just to the south of there, over the southern portion of the Great Lakes region, all the way towards upper New York State, we are going to see a wintry mix also develop.
[00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.844]  That snow across the Great Lakes region is going to continue not only today, but also into the day on Monday.
[00:01:02.064 --> 00:01:03.265]  Forecaster Brian Corning.
[00:01:03.665 --> 00:01:07.709]  NASA has called off any attempts to land Space Shuttle Endeavour today in Florida.
[00:01:07.949 --> 00:01:10.291]  Doesn't look like a good day for Florida today.
[00:01:10.831 --> 00:01:16.736]  The weather again is observed no-go and forecast no-go for the second opportunity.
[00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:21.820]  Endeavour has two more chances to land today at Edwards Air Force Base in California.
[00:01:22.221 --> 00:01:23.802]  And that's okay with the shuttle crew.
[00:01:25.327 --> 00:01:29.139]  Endeavor Commander Chris Ferguson, this is IRN USA Radio News.
[00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.972]  It works, it works, it works, it works!
[00:01:33.313 --> 00:01:35.574]  And what's best is it works from home.
[00:01:35.594 --> 00:01:37.576]  Hi, how in the world are you anyway?
[00:01:37.616 --> 00:01:41.720]  This is Andy Willoughby from the 3stepplan.com home business system.
[00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.043]  The dramatic difference with 3stepplan.com is that it does work.
[00:01:46.204 --> 00:01:55.912]  And after almost five years, I think that even the most diehard skeptic would have to agree there must be something different about the 3stepplan.com home business system.
[00:01:56.172 --> 00:02:06.337]  You see, we operate more like a mini-franchise so you get the expertise of people who have actually been successful working at home to help and guide you in operating your home business.
[00:02:06.477 --> 00:02:10.779]  It's kind of like a McDonald's franchise without the teenagers and big startup expense.
[00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.860]  And of course, we don't sell hamburgers.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.402]  You do get to work with some really nice people who share similar family values.
[00:02:17.742 --> 00:02:22.891]  To find out how you can make more money working from home, go to 3stepplan.com or call 800-480-2102 800-480-2102
[00:02:30.712 --> 00:02:32.893]  Retailers got a welcome surprise this weekend.
[00:02:32.913 --> 00:02:42.076]  Despite predictions of dismal sales, shoppers turned out in droves to help many stores end Black Friday in the black, just like it's supposed to do.
[00:02:42.476 --> 00:02:47.678]  Bloomberg.com reports Black Friday sales rose by $10.6 billion from a year ago.
[00:02:48.078 --> 00:02:52.499]  ShopperTrack RCT Corporation says that's a 3% jump from last year.
[00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:57.461]  However, it is still the smallest yearly gain retailers have seen since 2005.
[00:02:58.861 --> 00:03:09.149]  Senator Hillary Clinton and current Defense Secretary Robert Gates are expected to be among the names unveiled Monday when President-elect Barack Obama announces his national security team.
[00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:21.018]  It's also expected Obama will announce retired Marine General James Jones as White House National Security Advisor while tapping Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano as head of Homeland Security.
[00:03:21.693 --> 00:03:27.887]  For the latest news and analysis online, log on to irnnews.com.
[00:03:30.407 --> 00:03:34.009]  I'm Errol Squires, inventor of Relieve One Day Cold Sore Symptom Treatment.
[00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:39.432]  I invented Relieve because I wanted a very effective, natural treatment for cold sores that work really fast.
[00:03:39.612 --> 00:03:43.335]  Relieve works so well and so fast for me, my family and friends.
[00:03:43.495 --> 00:03:46.036]  I wanted to help other people who suffer from cold sores.
[00:03:46.236 --> 00:03:48.858]  I think people are smart enough to know if something works.
[00:03:49.118 --> 00:03:53.120]  If you suffer from cold sores, try Relieve and find out if it works for you.
[00:03:53.301 --> 00:03:56.562]  Relieve is comprised of botanical extracts and is guaranteed.
[00:03:56.662 --> 00:03:58.944]  Buy Relieve now at all major stores.
[00:04:00.808 --> 00:04:11.010]  The head of a retail workers union is accusing Walmart of a blatant level of irresponsibility in the Black Friday trapping death of a temporary worker at a New York store.
[00:04:11.511 --> 00:04:16.612]  United Food and Commercial Workers union leader Bruce Booth is charging the death was preventable.
[00:04:16.892 --> 00:04:21.093]  Nassau County Police stated the store may not have had enough security.
[00:04:21.113 --> 00:04:29.515]  A Walmart regional manager defended the store stating it had hired additional security and increased staff for the early morning Black Friday rush.
[00:04:30.385 --> 00:04:34.690]  There's a shake-up in the Indian government following the terrorist attacks in Mumbai.
[00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.412]  The Home Minister has called it quits.
[00:04:36.812 --> 00:04:41.097]  An Indian Prime Minister has met with the main political parties to urge unity.
[00:04:41.378 --> 00:04:47.465]  He says air and maritime security will be tightened in the aftermath of the attacks that killed more than 170 people.
[00:04:49.258 --> 00:04:56.302]  Bad boy, Iran is offering to help its neighboring Arab countries build joint light water nuclear power plants.
[00:04:56.722 --> 00:05:04.267]  It's not clear why Tehran is making that offer, but one reason may be to ease fears about its nuclear intentions.
[00:05:04.847 --> 00:05:07.029]  So far, no reaction from Iran's neighbors.
[00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:14.113]  A ransom has reportedly been agreed to for a Ukrainian freighter seized by Somali pirates two months ago.
[00:05:14.633 --> 00:05:17.655]  A spokesman said the ship and the crew could be freed within days.
[00:05:18.315 --> 00:05:20.156]  No word on the size of the ransom.
[00:05:20.456 --> 00:05:23.417]  The ship's cargo includes tanks and other heavy weapons.
[00:05:24.198 --> 00:05:25.158]  I'm Pete Levallee.

[00:07:13.165 --> 00:07:16.567]  We are live the 30th day of November 2008.
[00:07:16.767 --> 00:07:18.428]  We'll be here for the next two hours.
[00:07:18.908 --> 00:07:22.130]  We'll be taking your phone calls on a host of important issues at 877-590-5525.
[00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.230]  877-590-5525.
[00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:33.056]  Wherever you're listening locally in Central Texas to the station that we come to you from, syndicated across the country.
[00:07:33.616 --> 00:07:34.457]  News Radio 590, KLVJ 836-0590.
[00:07:34.477 --> 00:07:34.737]  Okay.
[00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:42.611]  Here are the important stacks of news I have in front of me.
[00:07:43.372 --> 00:07:53.577]  One of them is the Associated Press with a headline, 90% of infant formula sold in the United States has the deadly poison melamine in it.
[00:07:54.357 --> 00:08:05.863]  And what does the FDA do after two years of scandals with this and it turning out that most baby formula and thousands of foods have it in them, not just made in China but here in the United States as well,
[00:08:06.661 --> 00:08:11.243]  They come out and say, well, you know what, we're just going to say that melamine isn't bad for you then.
[00:08:13.544 --> 00:08:18.586]  Now, in China, thousands have died from this, hundreds of thousands have gotten sick in the last few years.
[00:08:19.967 --> 00:08:26.350]  Why now would our government, if you can call it that, say that it's not bad for you?
[00:08:27.518 --> 00:08:28.739]  I'll give you my take on that.
[00:08:28.799 --> 00:08:29.700]  We'll be discussing it.
[00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:34.804]  By the way, remember about a year and a half ago in China with the first big scandal dealing with this?
[00:08:34.864 --> 00:08:36.686]  They executed the head of the factory.
[00:08:37.346 --> 00:08:41.690]  They executed the head of the factory who allowed this to happen.
[00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:44.572]  And then now it's just, oh, so what?
[00:08:44.772 --> 00:08:45.713]  It's not bad for you.
[00:08:45.753 --> 00:08:46.794]  In fact, it's good for you.
[00:08:47.975 --> 00:08:48.875]  I have another report here.
[00:08:48.915 --> 00:08:50.777]  They just executed another guy.
[00:08:50.957 --> 00:08:54.400]  Reuters reports involved with this in the milk in China.
[00:08:55.146 --> 00:08:57.207]  So in China, they execute you for this.
[00:08:57.687 --> 00:09:03.288]  In the United States, their answer, with the executives allowing this to happen, is, you know what, we're just going to say that isn't bad for you.
[00:09:03.308 --> 00:09:03.908]  How's that sound?
[00:09:04.788 --> 00:09:07.609]  So, we'll be going over that for you today.
[00:09:08.049 --> 00:09:19.112]  And this story dovetails in with a culture of government, corporations, individuals, more and more, who just don't care about anybody else but themselves.
[00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:21.912]  Or, in many cases, don't even care about themselves.
[00:09:21.972 --> 00:09:27.055]  It's just a smiley-faced, smart-mouthed arrogance.
[00:09:27.396 --> 00:09:32.319]  A delusional outlook that many, many Americans have.
[00:09:32.339 --> 00:09:38.384]  And that's what's allowing just out-of-control corruption to breed at every level of our society.
[00:09:40.297 --> 00:09:47.624]  And of course that dovetails with worker dies in Long Island Walmart after being trampled in Black Friday Stampede.
[00:09:47.964 --> 00:09:55.812]  And all over the news across the nation are videos not just of this guy being stampeded and killed by hundreds of people running over him.
[00:09:56.758 --> 00:10:03.280]  Or the fact that they then threw fits and basically threatened a riot when they were told, you just killed this guy, we've got to close the store.
[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.481]  They said, I don't care, that's in the Associated Press.
[00:10:05.821 --> 00:10:10.262]  They said on record, we don't care if he's dead, we want our Xboxes.
[00:10:10.702 --> 00:10:13.783]  We want our Chinese slave goods and we want them now.
[00:10:14.303 --> 00:10:20.745]  We want our melamine-filled candies and children's formula.
[00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:23.101]  Because we're self-centered.
[00:10:23.421 --> 00:10:25.783]  We're so self-centered that we don't breastfeed our children.
[00:10:26.284 --> 00:10:29.466]  Though that's the reason women have breasts and all mammals have mammary glands.
[00:10:29.947 --> 00:10:38.674]  We don't care if statistically the cc size of the brain, the development of the IQ, the health of a child is inexorably tied to mother's milk.
[00:10:39.575 --> 00:10:41.877]  And we don't just care if the milk's full of poison.
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:48.683]  Again, it all just compounds and stacks up on top of itself.
[00:10:50.208 --> 00:10:59.113]  But then I saw videos all over the country of people at Walmart, Toys R Us, Target stores, fighting with each other over sale items.
[00:10:59.153 --> 00:11:01.774]  I mean, getting in brawls, in fist fights.
[00:11:02.294 --> 00:11:16.202]  They could care less if their country's being destroyed, if their national sovereignty's being destroyed, if a world government's being set up, if their currency's being devalued, if $7.8 trillion has been stolen in the last six weeks, according to APM Bloomberg.
[00:11:16.482 --> 00:11:18.583]  That's right, by the private Federal Reserve.
[00:11:19.801 --> 00:11:20.381]  They don't care.
[00:11:20.502 --> 00:11:31.048]  They don't care about anything but drinking beer, eating cheeseburgers, and what the rankings are for college football, and who's going to get the number one slot.
[00:11:31.769 --> 00:11:34.070]  And it's all been done by design.
[00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:39.153]  We have the government documents, the behavioral psychology, the evolutionary psychology documents on this.
[00:11:39.634 --> 00:11:46.358]  They have used Madison Avenue and PR to turn the American people and the people of the West, predominantly, into a bunch of
[00:11:47.339 --> 00:11:51.889]  Automaton-consuming androids who aren't even really conscious.
[00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:59.485]  And now that people don't care about their neighbors, their friends, their families, anybody for that matter, so what if the cop tasers your neighbor to death?
[00:11:59.525 --> 00:12:05.650]  So what if the CPS kidnaps your neighbor's children, or even your cousin's children, with no due process?
[00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:10.094]  And so what if they're five times more likely to kill the children or hurt the children in their custody?
[00:12:10.515 --> 00:12:14.038]  So what if the Texas Youth Commission runs giant rape camps with the children?
[00:12:14.338 --> 00:12:16.740]  So what if there's just corruption in every level of government?
[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:17.581]  So what?
[00:12:17.881 --> 00:12:18.402]  So what?
[00:12:18.562 --> 00:12:19.082]  So what?
[00:12:19.242 --> 00:12:19.803]  So what?
[00:12:20.845 --> 00:12:24.188]  Because we're all so self-centered and dumbed down and decadent.
[00:12:26.509 --> 00:12:32.194]  Worker dies at Long Island Walmart after being trampled in Black Friday Stampede.
[00:12:33.014 --> 00:12:40.400]  A Walmart worker died after being trampled when hundreds of shoppers smashed through the doors of a Long Island store Friday morning, police and witnesses said.
[00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:49.907]  The 34-year-old worker, employed as an overnight stock clerk, tried to hold back the unruly crowds just after the Valley Stream store opened at 5 a.m.
[00:12:51.494 --> 00:12:58.116]  And it went on to a report that they just stomped over his body and then he was pronounced dead at the hospital 30 minutes later.
[00:12:58.156 --> 00:13:01.797]  Now, that was the first story that came out about it out of the Daily News.
[00:13:02.097 --> 00:13:07.058]  Here's the Associated Press sought Walmart shoppers who trampled New York worker.
[00:13:07.138 --> 00:13:07.919]  That is the headline.
[00:13:07.979 --> 00:13:10.479]  It says, this crowd was out of control, Fleming said.
[00:13:10.939 --> 00:13:12.880]  He described the scene as utter chaos.
[00:13:13.699 --> 00:13:16.561]  Fleming manages a store and said the store didn't have enough security.
[00:13:16.901 --> 00:13:24.026]  Dozens of store employees trying to fight their way out to help Damore, who died, were also getting trampled by the crowd.
[00:13:24.066 --> 00:13:27.869]  Fleming said shoppers stepped over the man on the ground and streamed into the store.
[00:13:28.189 --> 00:13:32.932]  Damore, 34, of Queens, was taken to the hospital where he was pronounced dead around 6 a.m.
[00:13:33.232 --> 00:13:35.694]  Police said the exact cause of death had not been determined.
[00:13:36.074 --> 00:13:41.498]  The 28-year-old pregnant woman was also taken to the hospital where she and the baby were reported to be okay.
[00:13:42.395 --> 00:13:43.035]  And it goes on.
[00:13:43.055 --> 00:13:48.336]  It says, Kimberly Cribbs, who witnessed the stampede, said shoppers were acting like savages.
[00:13:48.376 --> 00:13:49.436]  Well, we are savages now.
[00:13:49.456 --> 00:13:50.257]  That's what they turned us into.
[00:13:50.917 --> 00:13:59.158]  I mean, the IQs from the poisons and the water and food and the fluoride, the education system by design to dumb us down.
[00:14:00.079 --> 00:14:02.199]  I mean, the average American can't find the U.S.
[00:14:02.259 --> 00:14:03.519]  on a map, on a globe.
[00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:06.580]  I mean, the average American doesn't know who the Vice President is.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.281]  The average American literally is a complete idiot.
[00:14:10.321 --> 00:14:11.581]  That's why we're so enslaved.
[00:14:12.512 --> 00:14:13.214]  And it goes on.
[00:14:13.395 --> 00:14:21.035]  When they were saying they had to leave, that an employee got killed, people were yelling, I've been online since yesterday morning, and they kept on shopping.
[00:14:22.757 --> 00:14:25.799]  I had to be forcibly brought out of the store by police.
[00:14:26.499 --> 00:14:28.920]  So this is the type of news we're dealing with.
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:29.680]  Here's another one.
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.542]  Witnesses fatal shooting followed toy store brawl.
[00:14:32.862 --> 00:14:37.964]  Two women started fighting with each other at a checkout line over who was in line first.
[00:14:38.225 --> 00:14:41.886]  So the two husbands pulled out guns and killed each other.
[00:14:41.906 --> 00:14:43.147]  That's AP.
[00:14:43.647 --> 00:14:44.708]  Again, I have this video here.
[00:14:44.788 --> 00:14:46.288]  Shoppers fight at Walmart.
[00:14:46.329 --> 00:14:47.129]  I got a whole bunch of these
[00:14:47.649 --> 00:14:52.896]  Uh, videos with them just greedily beating the daylights out of each other to try to get junk products.
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.082]  Fine, I'm sure a lot of it isn't junk products.
[00:14:58.122 --> 00:15:02.527]  The point is that it's junk compared to not acting like animals.
[00:15:02.828 --> 00:15:06.993]  That people put products above everything else in their lives.
[00:15:07.603 --> 00:15:08.824]  They don't care about knowledge.
[00:15:08.844 --> 00:15:10.085]  They don't care about being informed.
[00:15:10.105 --> 00:15:12.247]  They don't care about their liberties or their freedoms.
[00:15:12.287 --> 00:15:13.388]  They don't care about their health.
[00:15:13.608 --> 00:15:15.490]  They don't care if there's poison in the baby food.
[00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:20.414]  I mean, where's the national movement to get the melamine out of our food and the lead and all the other poisons?
[00:15:20.474 --> 00:15:22.095]  It's a huge list.
[00:15:22.555 --> 00:15:24.857]  Where's the national movement?
[00:15:24.877 --> 00:15:27.759]  90% of the baby formula has melamine in it, Associated Press.
[00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.000]  Where's the national movement?
[00:15:29.161 --> 00:15:29.981]  Where's the outcry?
[00:15:30.001 --> 00:15:30.722]  Where's the anger?
[00:15:31.314 --> 00:15:33.075]  They've been reporting this for almost two years.
[00:15:33.436 --> 00:15:36.117]  Now it's turning into a huge issue.
[00:15:36.558 --> 00:15:38.259]  It's in all these thousands of products.
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.841]  90% of the baby formula has it.
[00:15:41.701 --> 00:15:44.563]  And the government sees that the public is brain dead and doesn't care.
[00:15:44.603 --> 00:15:45.464]  So they say, you know what?
[00:15:45.724 --> 00:15:48.086]  We'll just tell you that melamine's good for you.
[00:15:48.743 --> 00:15:49.984]  You cannot make this up.
[00:15:50.024 --> 00:15:52.386]  Google, government says melamine not bad.
[00:15:52.647 --> 00:16:06.459]  And you will read the Food and Drug Administration saying that melamine is good for you even though it attacks every organ in your body, attacks your kidneys, attacks your brain, attacks your heart, attacks all your other major tissues.
[00:16:08.341 --> 00:16:10.523]  So, this culture of not caring.
[00:16:11.329 --> 00:16:14.453]  In the past, Americans, if they saw somebody run over by a car, would help them.
[00:16:14.693 --> 00:16:16.255]  Or saw a woman mugged, they'd help them.
[00:16:16.535 --> 00:16:18.097]  Or saw a cop run over, they'd help them.
[00:16:18.277 --> 00:16:20.419]  Or a kid being beaten up on the side of the road, they'd help them.
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:21.160]  Now they don't.
[00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:22.021]  They call 911.
[00:16:22.562 --> 00:16:26.686]  They hand over their responsibility to a government that won't and can't help them.
[00:16:26.706 --> 00:16:27.347]  We'll be right back.
[00:16:27.387 --> 00:16:27.868]  Stay with us.
[00:16:30.502 --> 00:16:34.147]  Everyone knows that Omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[00:16:34.207 --> 00:16:39.855]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[00:16:39.955 --> 00:16:44.000]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[00:16:44.301 --> 00:16:45.242]  Nature's Gem.
[00:16:45.422 --> 00:16:46.202]  We're good to go!
[00:17:09.872 --> 00:17:10.853]  We're good to go.
[00:17:31.298 --> 00:17:31.918]  Santa!
[00:17:32.038 --> 00:17:34.519]  Christmas Eve and you haven't left yet?
[00:17:34.959 --> 00:17:37.200]  Ho ho ho ho ho!
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:38.300]  No!
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.161]  I can't find my keys.
[00:17:40.461 --> 00:17:41.581]  Here's the perfect gift.

[00:17:57.386 --> 00:17:58.948]  Where did I put my glasses, Mrs. Claus?
[00:18:10.075 --> 00:18:11.156]  Oh, here they are!
[00:18:11.436 --> 00:18:14.959]  Luckily, Rudolph's nose isn't the only thing that lashes.

[00:18:30.475 --> 00:18:30.815]  Good day.
[00:18:30.996 --> 00:18:32.517]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:18:32.657 --> 00:18:32.957]  November 28, 2008.
[00:18:33.017 --> 00:18:34.079]  Gold open this morning at 811.40.
[00:18:34.139 --> 00:18:37.462]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for 835.79, 417.89 for a half ounce, and 208.95 for the quarter ounce.
[00:18:37.482 --> 00:18:37.722]  That's 835.79, 417.89, and 208.95.
[00:18:48.332 --> 00:19:00.702]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110, was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[00:19:00.842 --> 00:19:03.945]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[00:19:04.025 --> 00:19:07.308]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[00:19:07.368 --> 00:19:10.210]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrevealed.
[00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:13.192]  Minus has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[00:19:13.252 --> 00:19:15.993]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:19:16.174 --> 00:19:18.335]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[00:19:18.455 --> 00:19:21.157]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:19:21.357 --> 00:19:25.039]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[00:19:25.059 --> 00:19:25.259]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:19:30.522 --> 00:19:32.724]  Imagine feeling totally helpless.
[00:19:32.964 --> 00:19:39.009]  Imagine thinking and hearing clearly, but unable to move as the ground rises to meet you.
[00:19:39.249 --> 00:19:48.656]  Imagine the pain of a thousand needles as your body is invaded, locked, and hammered by 50,000 volts of the latest in taser technology.
[00:19:48.856 --> 00:19:56.402]  If this sounds scary, imagine how it would feel for anyone attempting to victimize a friend, loved one, or even yourself.
[00:19:56.642 --> 00:19:58.123]  FortressTactical.com
[00:19:58.323 --> 00:19:58.884]  We're good to go.
[00:20:18.467 --> 00:20:20.708]  That's FortressTactical.com.
[00:20:20.788 --> 00:20:27.369]  With Christmas just around the corner, give the gift of protection this year by visiting FortressTactical.com.
[00:20:27.429 --> 00:20:28.810]  Prohibited in certain states and counties.
[00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:29.990]  See website for details.
[00:20:33.051 --> 00:20:35.691]  You're listening to GCN.
[00:20:35.731 --> 00:20:37.952]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:20:50.702 --> 00:20:53.384]  All right, folks, we are back live.
[00:20:54.865 --> 00:21:03.670]  Coming up, a top Russian analyst for the government says they believe the United States is going to break up into five to six parts.
[00:21:04.671 --> 00:21:05.751]  You know what concerns me?
[00:21:05.891 --> 00:21:06.592]  Pentagon.
[00:21:09.434 --> 00:21:13.316]  Futurist projections say that they believe that's a serious danger.
[00:21:14.116 --> 00:21:16.438]  The British government believes that's a serious danger.
[00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:32.555]  Gerald Salente, who you heard on last Sunday's show, who's a top trends forecaster for IBM, major trends forecaster for CNN, Fox News, is saying that that is a real danger by 2012.
[00:21:32.615 --> 00:21:34.896]  The Russians are saying 2010.
[00:21:38.037 --> 00:21:40.998]  But what they're not explaining is this is by design.
[00:21:41.939 --> 00:21:45.480]  Just like the British fomented the Civil War between the North and the South,
[00:21:46.983 --> 00:21:49.404]  To try to break up the country, and that's mainline history.
[00:21:49.524 --> 00:21:52.644]  They just don't put it on your PBS documentaries about the subject.
[00:21:53.545 --> 00:22:04.147]  Or just like the British in the United States, the French, the Dutch, the Germans, about 150 years ago, broke China up into 10 different parts.
[00:22:04.327 --> 00:22:06.368]  This is what internationalists do.
[00:22:06.768 --> 00:22:08.569]  This is what globalism is.
[00:22:09.169 --> 00:22:10.209]  It's nothing new.
[00:22:13.667 --> 00:22:24.135]  So I'll be going over that later in the show but I do want to hear from callers specifically dealing with the subject that I just brought up.
[00:22:25.216 --> 00:22:34.303]  I mean almost every week I come in here and I could come in here every day but half the time I just don't want to even cover these stories because they make me so upset.
[00:22:34.944 --> 00:22:37.966]  Remember a few weeks ago I played clips here on the show in California
[00:22:38.655 --> 00:22:46.938]  For 45 minutes, some deranged schizophrenic was beating a two-year-old toddler to death on the side of a major highway.
[00:22:47.498 --> 00:22:55.261]  Hundreds of cars passed, scores of cars stopped, but fearfully stood back while he punched and stomped and kicked the small child.
[00:22:55.999 --> 00:22:59.880]  Now, the police didn't have any units in the area.
[00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:03.120]  It took them a long time to respond after the 911 call came in.
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:07.021]  So they diverted a police helicopter to land in a nearby field.
[00:23:07.421 --> 00:23:08.081]  They ran up.
[00:23:08.141 --> 00:23:10.902]  The guy wouldn't stop stomping the child, so they filled him full of lead.
[00:23:11.042 --> 00:23:11.842]  Good, I'm glad they did.
[00:23:12.922 --> 00:23:14.862]  Clearly, he's there committing this murder.
[00:23:15.022 --> 00:23:15.622]  There he is.
[00:23:15.942 --> 00:23:16.743]  He's not stopping.
[00:23:17.403 --> 00:23:18.563]  Boom, an eye for an eye.
[00:23:19.103 --> 00:23:20.743]  I'm certainly for the death penalty in that case.
[00:23:22.043 --> 00:23:25.084]  But the issue here is the public was trained
[00:23:25.811 --> 00:23:27.676]  To not intercede themselves.
[00:23:27.716 --> 00:23:29.942]  The public was trained to call 9-1-1.
[00:23:30.223 --> 00:23:34.274]  Told the story of the lady choking in a restaurant here in Austin.
[00:23:35.106 --> 00:23:39.328]  And I came out of the bathroom and she was choking and no one was helping her and they were saying call 9-1-1.
[00:23:39.348 --> 00:23:46.731]  They were arguing about who would call 9-1-1 and screaming like a bunch of gilded ninnies, men and women, probably 25-30 of them.
[00:23:47.011 --> 00:23:48.271]  And I had to shove them aside.
[00:23:48.512 --> 00:23:51.833]  They were trying to stop me from doing the Heimlich, going, do you know how?
[00:23:52.033 --> 00:23:54.034]  Wait till an ambulance, wait, do you know how?
[00:23:54.354 --> 00:23:59.996]  Oh, don't know, we can't have a slave like us involved in the action.
[00:24:00.316 --> 00:24:03.938]  We're just supposed to watch TV and watch football games and be spectators.
[00:24:04.578 --> 00:24:06.800]  A nation of people known for action.
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:11.303]  A nation of inventors and scientists and trailblazers.
[00:24:11.963 --> 00:24:19.328]  A nation of pioneers turned into a nation of cowardly, dumbed-down, arrogant scum.
[00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:33.571]  Now, not all of us, but on average, we have gone from the most inventive, the most intelligent, the most aggressive, the most dynamic, the most informed in the world, to now being the stupidest people in the first world.
[00:24:34.012 --> 00:24:35.853]  And there's only 15 first world nations.
[00:24:36.314 --> 00:24:40.337]  Last time I checked, we were 30-something in the world in every major category.
[00:24:40.877 --> 00:24:41.338]  We are
[00:24:42.079 --> 00:24:42.579]  That's great!
[00:25:02.654 --> 00:25:23.750]  That they, you know, wanting to pray at the altar of cheap Chinese slave goods so bad that they trampled this guy to death and then didn't care and refused to quit shopping and then police had to go in en masse and remove them as they were greedily still trying to line up at cash registers to buy the goods.
[00:25:26.374 --> 00:25:30.337]  If that isn't a testament to what's happened in this country, I don't know what it is.
[00:25:30.577 --> 00:25:40.826]  Why have we gone from being the most informed, the most active, go-getters, people who loved our Bill of Rights, our Constitution, to a nation of individuals that could care less about each other?
[00:25:41.326 --> 00:25:50.573]  And that's what it is, and it's not just poor folks wanting to rush into a Walmart and buy these slave goods that are de-industrializing the rest of our economy.
[00:25:51.294 --> 00:25:53.776]  Everything else is in the toilet, Walmart's profits are up.
[00:25:55.305 --> 00:25:56.526]  It's the sinking to the bottom here.
[00:25:57.446 --> 00:25:58.246]  It's the yuppies.
[00:25:58.406 --> 00:25:59.627]  It's the well-to-do people.
[00:25:59.667 --> 00:26:04.569]  It's the middle class, the upper middle class, the nouveau riche, full of themselves, arrogant.
[00:26:05.169 --> 00:26:07.210]  Won't talk to anybody outside of their class.
[00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:09.191]  Won't get involved in politics.
[00:26:09.251 --> 00:26:10.752]  Won't get involved in being informed.
[00:26:11.052 --> 00:26:16.434]  Won't say anything political that's politically incorrect on the liberal or conservative side.
[00:26:16.934 --> 00:26:18.335]  Politically neutralized.
[00:26:19.412 --> 00:26:21.093]  That's why the country is falling apart.
[00:26:21.113 --> 00:26:25.616]  We have a nation of people that don't talk to their neighbors, that aren't involved in their communities.
[00:26:26.156 --> 00:26:32.780]  All they do is watch the glowing television set every night and wring their hands over the BCS rankings.
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.522]  Oh my gosh, who is going to be number one?
[00:26:35.582 --> 00:26:36.963]  How are the coaches voting?
[00:26:37.403 --> 00:26:40.285]  I mean, just grown men calling into all these sports shows.
[00:26:40.585 --> 00:26:41.706]  It's fine to watch sports.
[00:26:41.766 --> 00:26:42.786]  It's fine to be into them.
[00:26:43.226 --> 00:26:45.508]  But to get angry and to be threatening and
[00:26:46.128 --> 00:27:04.353]  Call into talk shows and say this person I'd like to beat the daylights out of that, you know running back He didn't catch the pass or that receiver or oh my gosh UT really deserves the number one ranking You've got your priorities totally screwed up and on the other hand we have these wicked social engineers
[00:27:06.010 --> 00:27:20.855]  The social architects, the behavioral psychologists, the Madison Avenue PR masters, running our culture, showing us since the 50s millions and millions of simulated murders and deaths on television, to where people don't even get upset now when they see their fellow humans dying or being killed.
[00:27:21.976 --> 00:27:27.598]  And just like the people at Walmart, stampeding in, didn't care that they killed the guy and they just wanted their goods,
[00:27:28.607 --> 00:27:39.755]  Just like they didn't have any empathy for him, no one's going to have empathy for them when they lose their house, or they lose their job, or the CPS kidnaps their children, or the police beat them up at a checkpoint.
[00:27:40.356 --> 00:27:43.058]  Nobody's going to care about the cop when bad things happen to them.
[00:27:43.838 --> 00:27:46.040]  It is a society terminally corrupt.
[00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:49.342]  You know, Americans are only 4% of the world's population.
[00:27:49.362 --> 00:27:49.342]  4%!
[00:27:50.803 --> 00:27:55.987]  Americans are only 4% of the population, but we had, not anymore, we had half the wealth on the planet.
[00:27:56.287 --> 00:27:56.988]  And why was that?
[00:27:58.055 --> 00:28:02.278]  Other countries were vicious and greedy and aggressive and warlike.
[00:28:02.899 --> 00:28:03.519]  We were too.
[00:28:03.999 --> 00:28:13.826]  But it was because we were more moral, at least with each other, and people greedily guarded their liberties and freedoms, and then out of that came the milk and honey.
[00:28:14.146 --> 00:28:15.627]  Out of that came the great economy.
[00:28:15.868 --> 00:28:22.712]  And now the social engineers have taught us with shows like 24 and CSI and all these programs that torture is good if it gets answers.
[00:28:23.253 --> 00:28:24.714]  That secret arrest is good.
[00:28:25.394 --> 00:28:26.655]  That tyranny is good.
[00:28:26.955 --> 00:28:27.975]  That war is good.
[00:28:28.035 --> 00:28:30.456]  People make jokes about, let's just nuke all the Arabs.
[00:28:30.696 --> 00:28:32.017]  Let's just nuke all the Muslims.
[00:28:32.517 --> 00:28:36.759]  So what if a million and a half Iraqis have been killed in the five and a half years of occupation?
[00:28:36.959 --> 00:28:38.400]  And over a million before that.
[00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:39.840]  This has been going on for 18 years, since 1991.
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.161]  Late 1990 actually, with Desert Shield.
[00:28:47.549 --> 00:28:49.610]  You see, you don't care about those Arabs.
[00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:51.091]  You don't care about those Muslims.
[00:28:51.391 --> 00:28:53.432]  You don't care about those people over there.
[00:28:53.732 --> 00:28:56.294]  You say, just nuke them and turn them all into a glass parking lot.
[00:28:56.534 --> 00:29:00.736]  Well, I assure you, the elite running this country don't care about you either.
[00:29:01.236 --> 00:29:04.378]  And that's why they've stolen $7.8 trillion.
[00:29:04.418 --> 00:29:06.579]  That's Bloomberg and AP and Reuters.

[00:29:23.732 --> 00:29:24.013]  See?
[00:29:24.373 --> 00:29:25.995]  So you don't care about other people in the world?
[00:29:26.015 --> 00:29:26.875]  You don't care about your neighbor?
[00:29:27.116 --> 00:29:28.457]  Nobody cares about you either.
[00:29:28.617 --> 00:29:29.718]  And then we're all alone.

[00:33:32.844 --> 00:33:35.987]  Alright folks, we're back live.
[00:33:36.007 --> 00:33:42.373]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:57.864]  I want to go to your phone calls, and I've got a lot of other really important news that we're going to be covering as well.
[00:33:58.485 --> 00:34:01.266]  Like what really happened in India, in Mumbai.
[00:34:02.407 --> 00:34:11.732]  Oh yes, it is a staged terror attack, but a more sophisticated type attack, not a purely state-sponsored attack.
[00:34:11.812 --> 00:34:17.035]  The Pakistani government is basically coming out with the same analysis that I put out Friday.
[00:34:18.036 --> 00:34:19.837]  The Russian government is saying the same thing.
[00:34:20.638 --> 00:34:23.139]  And so later we'll be getting into that.
[00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:27.882]  You see, Pakistani intelligence was set up by the British, British intelligence.
[00:34:27.902 --> 00:34:29.642]  This is mainline history, ISI.
[00:34:31.263 --> 00:34:39.447]  And the ISI was allowed to then get nuclear weapons through the United States, Israel, and Britain.
[00:34:39.467 --> 00:34:41.228]  That's right, Google, the U.S.
[00:34:41.448 --> 00:34:45.150]  helped Pakistan get nukes, or Google, Israel helped them get nukes.
[00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:47.931]  You'll get BBC, you'll get AP, you'll get Reuters.
[00:34:48.661 --> 00:34:59.105]  Going back about 15 years ago, back when Bill Clinton first got into office, and then right through George Bush, the outgoing president.
[00:34:59.545 --> 00:35:02.726]  Because these guys are just puppets and carry out what their globalist masters tell them.
[00:35:03.046 --> 00:35:05.427]  Why would the globalists want to give nukes to Pakistan?
[00:35:06.747 --> 00:35:13.389]  Well, because they want to have a strategy of tension and have India and Pakistan at each other's throats over the disputed Kashmir region.
[00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:15.170]  Now something happened.
[00:35:16.942 --> 00:35:28.147]  There was another coup in the West put in Perez Musharraf eight years ago, and then about nine months ago he was finally thrown out as basically a dictator, and they did elect a government.
[00:35:30.128 --> 00:35:41.093]  And that government said, by the way, these terrorist forces that are in our country, they were trained in Afghanistan in the 1970s and 80s to fight the Russians, they work for British and U.S.
[00:35:41.133 --> 00:35:43.074]  intelligence, we want them out.
[00:35:44.156 --> 00:35:57.755]  And those very same radical forces in the last nine months, since a new government's been in power, have bombed the government buildings, have bombed government meetings, have blown up hotels, have tried to kill the Pakistani government!
[00:35:58.749 --> 00:36:22.017]  Remember, in the last nine months, every week or two, hearing about huge bombings in Pakistan, where the Taliban, where Al-Qaeda was trying to kill the Pakistani government, and then our government, Bush, and now Obama, get up on the news and claim Pakistan, the government, is working with the very people that are attacking them, trying to kick them out?
[00:36:23.278 --> 00:36:26.859]  See, the ISI works for the Western intelligence.
[00:36:28.456 --> 00:36:37.560]  The ISI is staging terror attacks trying to topple the Pakistani government so the United States has a pretext to come into Pakistan.
[00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:39.361]  Now, what have I been saying the last month?
[00:36:39.701 --> 00:36:43.763]  Since Joe Biden came out and said there will be a big international test for Obama.
[00:36:43.803 --> 00:36:44.883]  People said, what's he talking about?
[00:36:44.923 --> 00:36:45.363]  Economic?
[00:36:45.403 --> 00:36:46.424]  What's he... I said, no.
[00:36:46.944 --> 00:36:48.425]  It's going to be Pakistan.
[00:36:48.445 --> 00:36:49.405]  I said this last week.
[00:36:50.026 --> 00:36:50.966]  I said it two weeks ago.
[00:36:51.006 --> 00:36:51.826]  I said it a month ago.
[00:36:52.567 --> 00:36:53.027]  It will be
[00:36:54.392 --> 00:37:03.277]  Pakistan watched for staged terror attacks in and around Pakistan or in India to be blamed on the Pakistani government.
[00:37:05.238 --> 00:37:07.119]  And now what did you see happen?
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:09.840]  Now are these real Muslim terrorists?
[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:23.068]  Are these complete nut balls that would... all these commandos, as many as 50 of them, showing up in Mumbai, the financial capital of India, where the Taj Mahal is located, running around for three days, killing more than 300 people,
[00:37:24.693 --> 00:37:25.714]  Throwing hand grenades?
[00:37:27.395 --> 00:37:37.903]  Absolutely, ladies and gentlemen, they are real terrorists, and they believe in those camps, that they are fighting for Islam, they believe they're fighting the West, they believe they're fighting their mortal enemy, the Hindus.
[00:37:39.164 --> 00:37:45.968]  But then when you go and look at who's funding them, it's ISI and U.S., British, slash Israeli intelligence.
[00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:51.893]  So I said I'd get into this later, I guess I'm getting into it now, then we'll go to Mike, Joshua, Mike, David,
[00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:58.754]  Jaja, Ian, George, and others that are patiently holding.
[00:38:00.335 --> 00:38:20.030]  But later I'm also going to play a clip, we have time from international television discussing this, but the head foreign minister and the head intelligence chief in Pakistan are saying that it is a, well here's the Pakistan Times, Mubaih mayhem conspiracy to hit nuke, Galt says, Islamabad.
[00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:22.692]  The inter-services intelligence chief
[00:38:24.409 --> 00:38:30.273]  Hamid Gul said that the Mumbai incident is an international-based conspiracy to pry Pakistan of its atomic power.
[00:38:30.293 --> 00:38:32.454]  And then he goes into saying everything I've just said.
[00:38:33.075 --> 00:38:34.976]  Now, he said this yesterday.
[00:38:36.257 --> 00:38:37.518]  Friday, I went on air.
[00:38:37.538 --> 00:38:39.199]  I wasn't going to take off Friday, but I went on air.
[00:38:39.539 --> 00:38:43.882]  In the first hour, it's archived at InfoWars.com, and I said exactly what's here.
[00:38:44.523 --> 00:38:44.703]  Why?
[00:38:44.743 --> 00:38:45.503]  Because it's the truth.
[00:38:46.884 --> 00:38:52.528]  Why would Pakistan, who's being bombed by the Al-Qaeda groups, the real Al-Qaeda,
[00:38:53.487 --> 00:38:55.088]  Western-controlled, Western-founded.
[00:38:56.069 --> 00:39:03.115]  Why on Earth would they go attack India when they're doing everything they can to not have another war with India?
[00:39:03.295 --> 00:39:08.079]  They're doing everything they can to avert near-nuclear war in 2002, they already almost had.
[00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:17.688]  And then magically, fighters out of Pakistan get in to Mumbai, in India, and blow the living daylights out of the capital city.
[00:39:18.188 --> 00:39:19.229]  Terrorize the public.
[00:39:22.378 --> 00:39:24.520]  This happens over and over and over again.
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:38.550]  And it's been in the Jerusalem Post, it's been in Harass, it's been in the Israeli papers over and over again that the Israeli government will hire Arab agents who will go out and recruit young Palestinians and then pay them to stage terror attacks.
[00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:42.953]  Now that's not Alex Jones saying that, that is the Jerusalem Post and Harass.
[00:39:43.394 --> 00:39:48.978]  Now what came out of AP, Reuters, BBC, Dirk Spiegel last Monday?
[00:39:49.858 --> 00:39:51.720]  We wrote a story about it up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:39:53.354 --> 00:40:00.219]  The Kosovoans were happy to have the West come in and steal that away from Serbia and give it to the Muslims.
[00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:10.307]  But now the Muslims and the Serbs want the West, predominantly Germany, the main force for NATO, in Kosovo, southern Serbia.
[00:40:10.747 --> 00:40:12.389]  Now broken off, basically given to Albania.
[00:40:12.689 --> 00:40:13.490]  They want them out.
[00:40:14.682 --> 00:40:16.004]  The Germans were caught.
[00:40:16.044 --> 00:40:17.826]  This is mainstream news.
[00:40:17.906 --> 00:40:20.349]  This is admitted for listeners.
[00:40:20.389 --> 00:40:21.290]  Do not be lazy.
[00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:23.052]  Do not choose to just say I'm lying.
[00:40:23.352 --> 00:40:24.313]  Go pull it up.
[00:40:24.474 --> 00:40:24.854]  Google it.
[00:40:28.218 --> 00:40:32.563]  Hundreds of papers reported this because other NATO forces caught them.
[00:40:32.643 --> 00:40:34.746]  No, all the NATO forces aren't terrorists.
[00:40:36.269 --> 00:40:51.673]  Select groups, German intelligence was caught machine-gunning and hand-grenading government buildings, NATO buildings, blaming it on the Kosovoans so that they would have a pretext to move in with a larger force.
[00:40:53.133 --> 00:40:56.654]  And so they would have a pretext to stay in the country.
[00:40:58.314 --> 00:41:03.515]  And then there was another case where the Polish government this week came out and said, yes, when we were in
[00:41:07.014 --> 00:41:18.279]  South Ossetia, on a diplomatic mission, the Georgians, who by the way they're allied with, ran a sneak attack on them, trying to blame it on the Russians.
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.380]  And the Russians do the same thing too.
[00:41:21.721 --> 00:41:24.402]  They've been caught blowing stuff up before and blaming it on their enemies.
[00:41:26.403 --> 00:41:27.103]  The point is,
[00:41:28.803 --> 00:41:32.004]  It's so much more sophisticated than what the media tells you.
[00:41:32.424 --> 00:41:36.246]  It's so much more sophisticated than the way they lay it out there and present it.
[00:41:36.786 --> 00:41:38.447]  Governments throughout history, listen.
[00:41:39.707 --> 00:41:44.729]  We wrote a story a few months ago and it came out on WikiLeaks, got picked up by major newspapers around the world.
[00:41:45.489 --> 00:41:49.991]  The army admitted it was real but said they want to find out who released it because they want to arrest them.
[00:41:50.928 --> 00:41:56.591]  The Army released the 2000, it was leaked, the 2004 Army Manual.
[00:41:56.731 --> 00:41:57.691]  And we have copies of it.
[00:41:57.731 --> 00:41:58.452]  It's up on the site.
[00:41:58.672 --> 00:41:59.372]  We have links to it.
[00:41:59.392 --> 00:42:00.553]  You can read the Army Manual.
[00:42:02.154 --> 00:42:03.154]  And the Army Manual number.
[00:42:04.135 --> 00:42:08.597]  And it says, it teaches Army Captains in Black Ops and Special Operations.
[00:42:09.457 --> 00:42:11.378]  No, the General Army Captains aren't taught this.
[00:42:11.438 --> 00:42:12.499]  It's all compartmentalized.
[00:42:13.757 --> 00:42:14.957]  That's how evil operates.
[00:42:15.538 --> 00:42:16.918]  Most of the troops are the best people in the world.
[00:42:16.938 --> 00:42:19.299]  They're great, hard-working, brave, incredible people.
[00:42:19.579 --> 00:42:26.421]  But the army captains, they psychologically test, do they put through black ops, do they decide they're immoral, or quote, will do the end justifies the means.
[00:42:27.601 --> 00:42:39.545]  They give them an army training manual that tells them to create staged terror attacks, false flag attacks, how to stage bombing attacks in the third world to blame it on their political enemies.
[00:42:41.606 --> 00:42:42.026]  The U.S.
[00:42:42.066 --> 00:42:42.966]  did this in Vietnam.
[00:42:45.197 --> 00:42:48.120]  And my point is, they do this over and over again.
[00:42:49.241 --> 00:42:52.604]  And the argument is, okay, well, the Russians do it, we've got to do it.
[00:42:52.684 --> 00:42:54.365]  You know, we've got to have every tool at our disposal.
[00:42:54.405 --> 00:42:58.749]  Well, see, once you allow that, just like Operation Northwoods, ABC News headline, U.S.
[00:42:58.769 --> 00:43:00.411]  government plan to attack U.S.
[00:43:00.431 --> 00:43:01.752]  cities as pretext for war.
[00:43:02.693 --> 00:43:07.517]  Operation Northwoods, hijack jets, bomb D.C., commit sniper attacks, how to frame Patsy's.
[00:43:09.539 --> 00:43:11.341]  Have mass shootings on the streets like Mumbai.
[00:43:12.714 --> 00:43:13.976]  Operation Northwoods, Google that.
[00:43:14.216 --> 00:43:16.158]  ABC News, Baltimore Sun, Associated Press.
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:23.087]  You see, I'm just reporting to you here what's mainstream, but it's hidden in the back of the paper.
[00:43:23.587 --> 00:43:23.928]  Okay?
[00:43:23.948 --> 00:43:24.869]  Alright, I promise.
[00:43:25.149 --> 00:43:27.812]  Calls for the next segment, end of the next hour, I'm gonna get to everybody.
[00:43:28.092 --> 00:43:29.274]  When we come back, stay with me.
[00:43:30.538 --> 00:43:32.039]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:43:32.219 --> 00:43:33.660]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:43:33.981 --> 00:43:36.202]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:43:36.663 --> 00:43:41.406]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:43:41.787 --> 00:43:44.649]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[00:45:55.416 --> 00:45:56.676]  People are losing weight!
[00:45:56.937 --> 00:45:57.637]  Energy is being
[00:45:57.637 --> 00:45:57.997]  We're good.
[00:46:16.089 --> 00:46:18.670]  Call us for our address and send a check or money order.
[00:46:18.830 --> 00:46:22.711]  The phone number is 928-308-0408.
[00:46:23.052 --> 00:46:24.372]  Again, 928-308-0408.
[00:46:27.493 --> 00:46:30.154]  Once again, thank you from GetTheTea.com.
[00:46:30.434 --> 00:46:32.155]  Lead from solder and copper pipes.
[00:46:32.315 --> 00:46:33.395]  Mercury from fish.
[00:46:33.495 --> 00:46:34.256]  Dental fillings.
[00:46:34.396 --> 00:46:34.976]  Vaccines.
[00:46:35.156 --> 00:46:36.056]  Arsenic in the water.
[00:46:36.176 --> 00:46:40.038]  These heavy metal toxins are difficult or even impossible to avoid.
[00:46:40.178 --> 00:46:43.939]  Even trace amounts of these heavy metals over time can impact your health.
[00:46:44.139 --> 00:46:55.524]  Many health problems have been suggested as being related to this heavy metal exposure, including memory loss, high blood pressure, depression, mood swings, speech disorders, neuropathy, autoimmune diseases, chronic fatigue, and more.
[00:46:55.684 --> 00:47:01.726]  Unfortunately, traditional detoxifying isn't able to clear the body of these harmful and potentially deadly toxins.
[00:47:01.866 --> 00:47:04.308]  That's why there's Pura Clear from Ripple Creek.
[00:47:04.428 --> 00:47:10.170]  Pura Clear contains a proprietary blend of ingredients, including a cilantro extract and alpha-lipoic acid.
[00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:12.372]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:49.623]  Just to put a bookend on what I was saying about the Dubai Massacre, three days of terror in India.
[00:47:50.944 --> 00:47:56.867]  The Pakistani President is publicly begging India not to start a new war with him.
[00:47:57.528 --> 00:48:00.749]  He's saying that it was staged, he's saying they had nothing to do with it.
[00:48:01.069 --> 00:48:02.430]  Again, key bono, who benefits?
[00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:03.651]  Why would they do that?
[00:48:05.251 --> 00:48:07.393]  No, the West wants to go into Pakistan.
[00:48:07.453 --> 00:48:09.415]  Obama has said he's going to go into Pakistan.
[00:48:09.896 --> 00:48:18.364]  They don't like the government that's in Pakistan right now, so they fund militants that they created in the 70s and in the 80s to then go in and attack.
[00:48:18.404 --> 00:48:21.867]  And that's just what all the evidence here shows.
[00:48:22.608 --> 00:48:24.149]  Remember the Army Training Manual.
[00:48:24.589 --> 00:48:25.370]  There's several others.
[00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:26.912]  It says staged terror attacks.
[00:48:27.993 --> 00:48:30.315]  And it's very, very dangerous and very, very serious.
[00:48:31.508 --> 00:48:38.731]  But it is radical Islam that allows these intelligence agencies to find these mindless dupes to carry these type of activities out.
[00:48:38.771 --> 00:48:40.051]  And are there real Muslim terrorists?
[00:48:40.591 --> 00:48:41.092]  Absolutely.
[00:48:41.112 --> 00:48:45.353]  Are there real Hindu terrorists that go and kill Muslims routinely in India?
[00:48:45.773 --> 00:48:46.314]  Absolutely.
[00:48:46.674 --> 00:48:47.734]  Are there Christian radicals?
[00:48:47.834 --> 00:48:48.414]  Absolutely.
[00:48:48.835 --> 00:48:54.717]  The point is the big spectaculars are always government provocateur or staged.
[00:48:55.897 --> 00:48:59.619]  Whereas 9-11 is 100% staged, most of the other attacks are provocateur like in 91.
[00:49:01.468 --> 00:49:09.133]  93.
[00:49:02.549 --> 00:49:09.133]  New York Times reported the FBI cooked the bomb, trained the drivers, gave them the detonators, then ordered their informants to stand down and let the bombing take place.
[00:49:10.314 --> 00:49:14.777]  Oh yeah, they found radical Muslims that would do it, and they built the bomb for them, because the idiots didn't know how.
[00:49:14.797 --> 00:49:16.959]  Alright, I'm going to shut up about that.
[00:49:16.999 --> 00:49:18.260]  Let's go ahead and go to your calls.
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:21.962]  Mike in Houston, thanks for holding today.
[00:49:22.242 --> 00:49:23.343]  Good to have you on the air with us.
[00:49:24.023 --> 00:49:25.024]  Merry Christmas to you, Alex.
[00:49:25.084 --> 00:49:26.165]  Thank you for taking my call.
[00:49:26.745 --> 00:49:27.005]  Thank you.
[00:49:28.843 --> 00:49:33.747]  I wanted to point out, uh, if you got a chance, there was a big, uh, huge article in the Houston Chronicle today.
[00:49:33.827 --> 00:49:38.110]  The headline is, Guns Sold Here, Kill in Mexico.
[00:49:39.457 --> 00:49:43.898]  They're blaming the Houston gun shop owners for selling the weapons to the Mexican drug cartels.
[00:49:45.879 --> 00:49:46.859]  I've seen similar stories.
[00:49:46.999 --> 00:49:49.940]  Any way to demonize the Second Amendment and disarm us?
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:50.520]  No.
[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:52.940]  You have a drug war going on with the U.S.
[00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:58.702]  funding tens of billions a year down there to send their drug cartels after the other drug cartels.
[00:49:58.942 --> 00:50:03.023]  So there is a war on drugs, but it's a fight between banks in the U.S.
[00:50:03.123 --> 00:50:04.163]  and England and Europe
[00:50:04.643 --> 00:50:08.106]  Against the cartels that are down there that aren't paying their cut.
[00:50:08.166 --> 00:50:16.313]  And yes, I know they're now demonizing the Second Amendment, using the incredible crime wave, the 2,000 dead on the Texas border.
[00:50:16.833 --> 00:50:18.334]  11 months so far, over 2,000 dead.
[00:50:19.793 --> 00:50:21.614]  On the Texas-Mexico border.
[00:50:21.755 --> 00:50:31.021]  What about the other Houston Chronicle articles about tens of thousands of violent, felon, illegal aliens released out of Houston jails alone because the feds won't come pick them up?
[00:50:31.161 --> 00:50:32.262]  I mean rapists.
[00:50:32.322 --> 00:50:33.123]  I mean murderers.
[00:50:33.363 --> 00:50:35.605]  No, they turn crime loose on us.
[00:50:35.825 --> 00:50:37.586]  They allow lawlessness to take place.
[00:50:37.906 --> 00:50:40.668]  Then they hire more cops and won't let them fight crime.
[00:50:40.809 --> 00:50:42.770]  They got them out there writing old ladies tickets.
[00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:43.611]  Exactly.
[00:50:44.191 --> 00:50:44.631]  Exactly.
[00:50:44.751 --> 00:50:45.372]  And you know what?
[00:50:46.076 --> 00:50:51.579]  Everybody should write a letter to the editor telling the Chronicle, you know, how dare you criticize these gun shop owners.
[00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:55.962]  I mean, what's to stop somebody from selling somebody a car that wants to go out and shoot somebody?
[00:50:56.102 --> 00:51:08.809]  Look, I saw a month ago the Justice Department saying, we've got to close the gun show loophole, which means you can't privately sell a gun to somebody at your house, at a gun show, you can't sell it to your neighbor, you can't buy a gun from your grandpa or your cousin.
[00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:12.351]  They want to shut down all gun sales that aren't registered.
[00:51:12.852 --> 00:51:13.292]  Exactly.
[00:51:13.312 --> 00:51:15.133]  And that's what NICS is, it is registered.
[00:51:17.418 --> 00:51:18.398]  And I'll tell you what, man.
[00:51:19.679 --> 00:51:20.799]  It's just so frustrating.
[00:51:22.519 --> 00:51:25.900]  Oh, and the article pointed out all these purchases were fraudulent.
[00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:26.841]  It's right there.
[00:51:27.361 --> 00:51:28.441]  Fraudulent purchases.
[00:51:28.521 --> 00:51:29.001]  I mean, you know.
[00:51:29.761 --> 00:51:31.982]  I mean, they're a bunch of buffoons.
[00:51:32.922 --> 00:51:34.303]  It's total baloney.
[00:51:34.663 --> 00:51:35.963]  The Mexican drug cartels
[00:51:37.452 --> 00:51:42.734]  Narcotics is a $400 billion a year trade just in the United States a year.
[00:51:43.234 --> 00:51:47.396]  Okay, they're not buying their guns at the gun shows in Houston.
[00:51:47.636 --> 00:51:49.217]  Are low-level drug dealers doing it?
[00:51:49.597 --> 00:51:50.297]  Absolutely!
[00:51:50.597 --> 00:51:53.919]  More reason why I need my Second Amendment to protect myself.
[00:51:53.999 --> 00:51:54.759]  I appreciate your call.
[00:51:54.799 --> 00:51:57.080]  By the way, crime has been exploding for two years.
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:58.361]  Crime peaked in 1991.
[00:51:58.661 --> 00:52:01.042]  The highest it had ever been.
[00:52:01.062 --> 00:52:04.363]  Then it went down about 20%, depending on what state you're in, but on average.
[00:52:04.543 --> 00:52:06.524]  Just pull up Unified Crime Statistics.
[00:52:07.671 --> 00:52:08.712]  Violent crime statistics.
[00:52:09.172 --> 00:52:10.653]  Now it's shooting back up.
[00:52:10.853 --> 00:52:11.994]  It's shooting back up.
[00:52:12.414 --> 00:52:15.857]  And that's because a bad economy always causes more crime.
[00:52:16.457 --> 00:52:19.899]  I mean, here in Austin, I'm reading about carjackings, home invasions, everywhere.
[00:52:20.079 --> 00:52:22.241]  But they won't say it's because crime's gone up.
[00:52:22.421 --> 00:52:24.142]  Well, let me tell the listeners this all over the country.
[00:52:24.462 --> 00:52:25.603]  Crime has exploded.
[00:52:25.883 --> 00:52:26.744]  Lock your cars.
[00:52:26.904 --> 00:52:27.845]  Lock your houses.
[00:52:28.225 --> 00:52:29.166]  Get a firearm.
[00:52:29.206 --> 00:52:30.126]  Learn how to use it.
[00:52:30.647 --> 00:52:32.508]  And kill people that come in your house.
[00:52:32.828 --> 00:52:34.248]  That's why I love living in Texas.
[00:52:34.329 --> 00:52:35.309]  I don't live in New York.
[00:52:35.629 --> 00:52:40.630]  I don't live in Chicago where they've totally disarmed the people so they have the highest crime rates and all the criminals move there.
[00:52:40.911 --> 00:52:52.474]  I love living in a state like Florida or Texas or Arizona or Vermont where you don't have hardly any home invasions compared to those because they know they'll get killed!
[00:52:52.854 --> 00:52:54.875]  You come in my house, I'm gonna kill you!
[00:52:55.215 --> 00:52:57.476]  You bastard murdering criminals!
[00:52:57.776 --> 00:52:58.676]  Stay away from me!
[00:52:59.685 --> 00:53:03.547]  Every day I look at my children and my wife, and I don't like punks and criminals on the streets.
[00:53:03.807 --> 00:53:04.628]  And I'm... Listen.
[00:53:05.428 --> 00:53:05.969]  Google this.
[00:53:06.029 --> 00:53:07.189]  Google this for me in there, guys.
[00:53:07.229 --> 00:53:08.210]  I can't type while I talk.
[00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:13.813]  They had a story two weeks ago in the Houston Chronicle about tens of thousands of violent felons being released.
[00:53:14.193 --> 00:53:17.575]  Google... What was it?
[00:53:18.576 --> 00:53:20.897]  400,000 criminals released from Houston jails.
[00:53:21.638 --> 00:53:22.518]  That's the real number.
[00:53:22.538 --> 00:53:23.779]  And you're like, how is that possible?
[00:53:24.665 --> 00:53:26.547]  Well, Houston Metro is 8 million people.
[00:53:26.847 --> 00:53:28.028]  Half of them are illegal aliens.
[00:53:28.349 --> 00:53:33.333]  It's not that Mexicans are criminals from Mexico, it's that the criminals come up here, because this is the happy hunting ground.
[00:53:33.734 --> 00:53:38.138]  Remember the guy that went around murdering dozens of people on the railways?
[00:53:38.338 --> 00:53:40.400]  He kept getting caught, but they would always release him?
[00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:41.761]  Pull that story up! 400,000!
[00:53:44.187 --> 00:53:45.088]  Houston Chronicle.
[00:53:45.468 --> 00:53:48.090]  I want something done about it right now!
[00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:51.212]  Don't you be out there writing tickets on the highway all day!
[00:53:51.232 --> 00:53:57.396]  You get out there and you stop the crime wave invasion from Mexico and keep your hands off my guns!
[00:54:00.178 --> 00:54:02.459]  Joshua in Florida here on the air, go ahead.
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:04.380]  Hey, how you doing Alex?
[00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:04.740]  Good.
[00:54:06.021 --> 00:54:10.144]  I wanted to comment on the person getting trampled there at Walmart.
[00:54:10.164 --> 00:54:12.185]  I watched the article, the story there on MSNBC.
[00:54:13.519 --> 00:54:21.721]  And they use that pretty quickly to spin it to say, well, you know, this could be avoided if we had more people for crowd control or more law enforcement.
[00:54:21.781 --> 00:54:22.742]  What do you think about that?
[00:54:23.222 --> 00:54:26.783]  No, we need the public to not turn into savages, as the AP said.
[00:54:27.183 --> 00:54:34.205]  And we, again, you cannot, with a million cops, with a billion cops, you can't control a society degenerating.
[00:54:34.525 --> 00:54:37.166]  All you get is the degenerated public becoming cops.
[00:54:38.371 --> 00:54:39.492]  This is how tyranny works.
[00:54:39.532 --> 00:54:48.559]  They break down society by design, the social engineers, then they terrify the normal people, the middle class people, into accepting tyranny in the name of being safe.
[00:54:51.181 --> 00:54:52.722]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:54:52.763 --> 00:54:55.845]  They need to talk about the fact that the public is turning into animals.
[00:54:56.586 --> 00:54:57.086]  Absolutely.
[00:54:57.106 --> 00:55:02.010]  I also wanted to say, I was researching a while back, have you heard anything about SafeLink Wireless?
[00:55:02.774 --> 00:55:09.417]  I saw that and what that is is the government is going to be giving cell phones to low-income families, to anyone who doesn't have a cell phone.
[00:55:09.969 --> 00:55:12.730]  Is that just to make sure that everyone is on the grid?
[00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:13.911]  Yes, they do.
[00:55:13.931 --> 00:55:18.973]  The Telecommunications Act of 96, it's all satellite triangulated through the cell tower's GPS.
[00:55:19.013 --> 00:55:22.094]  They listen to you in live time, not just track you.
[00:55:22.155 --> 00:55:22.875]  Thank you for the call.
[00:55:22.915 --> 00:55:23.495]  Let's go ahead.
[00:55:23.515 --> 00:55:25.316]  I got mad earlier thinking about these criminals.
[00:55:25.776 --> 00:55:26.897]  George in Texas.
[00:55:27.237 --> 00:55:28.197]  George, you're on the air.
[00:55:28.657 --> 00:55:29.538]  How are you doing, Alex?
[00:55:29.698 --> 00:55:30.018]  Good.
[00:55:30.758 --> 00:55:36.461]  You know, when I lived in Florida, you know, Genco, I had a 9mm because I tell you, people were trying to take the copper out of
[00:55:36.843 --> 00:55:41.606]  The copper tubing out of my air conditioner, and I was there, I was glad I had a gun.
[00:55:41.666 --> 00:55:49.690]  They need to die, and then that'll teach these scum, because what happens is they invade people's houses, and then nothing's done, and they end up killing and raping.
[00:55:50.031 --> 00:55:51.531]  I'm tired of innocents being hurt.
[00:55:51.832 --> 00:55:55.193]  I love it when home invaders get their butts shot.
[00:55:55.714 --> 00:55:57.735]  I love it when a piece of lead gets parked in their heart.
[00:55:58.925 --> 00:56:05.734]  Well, anyway, uh, I remember, uh, back, like, when, uh, when they were starting to ban AK-47s, they had a... They never banned AK-47s.
[00:56:05.754 --> 00:56:07.476]  You bought a $250 stamp.
[00:56:07.837 --> 00:56:11.942]  The MAC-90 semi-automatic variants of those is what they tried to restrict.
[00:56:12.492 --> 00:56:17.398]  Well, anyway, uh, this family put a gun-free home sign in their front yard.
[00:56:17.438 --> 00:56:17.898]  Guess what?
[00:56:18.299 --> 00:56:18.980]  They got invaded.
[00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:20.401]  Absolutely!
[00:56:20.762 --> 00:56:26.068]  Listen, you pull up the Chicago crime statistics, they've had 20 people killed in one day there this year.
[00:56:26.409 --> 00:56:28.571]  Because they know the public is disarmed.
[00:56:28.771 --> 00:56:30.393]  And of course, and the police are corrupt.
[00:56:30.633 --> 00:56:32.636]  The son of the mob boss runs the city.
[00:56:33.311 --> 00:56:33.911]  Of course!
[00:56:33.931 --> 00:56:36.753]  Anywhere they take your guns, you have tyranny!
[00:56:36.773 --> 00:56:37.894]  I appreciate your call.
[00:56:37.934 --> 00:56:38.954]  I'm going to jam in one more.
[00:56:39.415 --> 00:56:41.356]  Jaja, in New York.
[00:56:41.396 --> 00:56:42.817]  You're on the air worldwide.
[00:56:43.257 --> 00:56:43.957]  What's up, Alex?
[00:56:44.117 --> 00:56:44.978]  How are you doing today?
[00:56:45.298 --> 00:56:47.099]  Good.
[00:56:47.159 --> 00:56:49.921]  Those stampedes, first of all, it's totally third world.
[00:56:49.981 --> 00:56:53.143]  I used to live in Brazil, and that is totally typical of a third world mentality.
[00:56:53.163 --> 00:56:54.303]  So we are degenerating.
[00:56:54.323 --> 00:56:57.385]  Now, I gotta... No, we are becoming a third world nation.
[00:56:58.366 --> 00:57:00.267]  We're totally becoming... And everything that comes with it.
[00:57:01.866 --> 00:57:10.229]  It's really, it is fully brainwashing people, and they think it's okay, and people are going to get used to it, and then you're going to see it, and then they're not even going to talk about it on the news, okay?
[00:57:10.549 --> 00:57:11.449]  But let me tell you something.
[00:57:11.649 --> 00:57:13.490]  An ex-boyfriend of mine got in touch with me.
[00:57:13.710 --> 00:57:15.390]  He's a FEMA project officer.
[00:57:15.671 --> 00:57:20.952]  I hit him with a whole bunch of information, and I said, you work for the devil, and he hit me back, and he used to be a punk rocker.
[00:57:20.972 --> 00:57:21.873]  He got me on the phone.
[00:57:22.173 --> 00:57:25.694]  He told me he'd seen a lot of stuff, and I got all the information today.
[00:57:26.174 --> 00:57:29.555]  He said that basically he's an engineer, he's an electrician,
[00:57:30.214 --> 00:57:31.375]  He's the head of company there.
[00:57:31.935 --> 00:57:34.738]  They're totally compartmentalized over there.
[00:57:34.778 --> 00:57:36.859]  They're totally kept where they don't know certain things.
[00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:41.463]  They have shopping centers all over the United States that they're keeping off limits.
[00:57:41.823 --> 00:57:42.724]  They have armed guards.
[00:57:43.084 --> 00:57:44.566]  And he has cards and everything.
[00:57:44.806 --> 00:57:46.627]  And even if they see them every day... That's been in the news.
[00:57:46.667 --> 00:57:49.510]  They're moving in bunks and generators into power plants.
[00:57:49.890 --> 00:57:50.230]  Stay there.
[00:57:50.250 --> 00:57:51.531]  I want to hear more about it after the news.
[00:57:51.791 --> 00:57:52.872]  Will you hold to the news with us?
[00:57:52.892 --> 00:57:53.953]  Of course!
[00:57:54.253 --> 00:57:55.575]  I put her on hold, Jaja.
[00:57:57.020 --> 00:58:02.926]  And we'll get to Ian, David, Ralph, Mike, and many, many others when the second hour continues.
[00:58:02.986 --> 00:58:05.229]  And folks, they've trained you to not get mad.
[00:58:05.429 --> 00:58:06.750]  They've trained you to not get upset.
[00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:08.732]  They've trained you to not stand up.
[00:58:08.972 --> 00:58:11.415]  You're only allowed to get mad about the BCS rankings.
[00:58:11.615 --> 00:58:13.557]  You're only allowed to care about football and baseball.
[00:58:13.777 --> 00:58:18.602]  Instead of really getting angry about enslavement and tyranny, you're meant to get angry about that.
[00:58:18.782 --> 00:58:19.543]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:19.623 --> 00:58:20.104]  Stay with us.
[00:58:20.908 --> 00:58:21.808]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[00:58:54.601 --> 00:58:57.903]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[00:58:57.923 --> 00:59:05.368]  This low-mintage collector coin, with a total series mintage under $600,000, has sold at four times its current price.
[00:59:05.408 --> 00:59:08.771]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.

[00:59:21.565 --> 00:59:22.807]  Hello, I'm Steve Schenck.
[00:59:23.307 --> 00:59:29.535]  For the past several months, folks have constantly asked me to give them the date as to when they should be finished stocking up on food.
[00:59:30.336 --> 00:59:40.428]  We've been so beaten up by stock market banking, housing, and unemployment crashes that we're desensitized and frozen inactive like the frog being unknowingly cooked in gradually increasingly hot water.
[00:59:40.908 --> 00:59:41.829]  Well, snap out of it.
[00:59:41.869 --> 00:59:42.849]  We now have a deadline.
[00:59:43.349 --> 00:59:44.850]  Joe Biden said it's going to happen.
[00:59:45.390 --> 00:59:56.737]  Former Secretary of State Colin Powell went on CBS Meet the Press and pointed to about January 22nd as the time a major international incident would force the new president to make unpopular decisions.
[00:59:57.297 --> 01:00:02.960]  Well, I take the general at his word and my best advice is to have your food in your possession prior to the inauguration.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:08.324]  Contact efoodsdirect.com for your supplies prior to this deadline for disaster.
[01:00:08.865 --> 01:00:12.648]  Ask yourself, is it better to have too much too soon or too little too late?
[01:00:13.209 --> 01:00:20.775]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web efoodsdirect.com What do you think?
[01:00:21.476 --> 01:00:28.121]  Those stories in your weekend weather forecast are just... You are listening to GCN!
[01:00:28.842 --> 01:00:29.803]  It's five o'clock.
[01:00:34.916 --> 01:00:36.538]  IRN USA Radio News.
[01:00:36.738 --> 01:00:37.699]  I'm Jody Jordan.
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:41.063]  There's more fallout from the terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India.
[01:00:41.544 --> 01:00:46.109]  The country's Home Minister has resigned amid criticism of how the situation was handled.
[01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:52.917]  The death toll is more than 170, but could rise as officials search the 10 attack sites.
[01:00:53.726 --> 01:00:56.487]  This worshipper says prayers are important right now.
[01:00:56.507 --> 01:01:01.887]  I think the entire community joined together in praying for all those who have departed from this world.
[01:01:01.967 --> 01:01:09.189]  There are fears that anti-government protests in Thailand may be spreading beyond two occupied airports, which have been shut down for days.
[01:01:09.769 --> 01:01:10.809]  Here's Mike Casey.
[01:01:10.849 --> 01:01:12.529]  There's no sign of that changing.
[01:01:12.549 --> 01:01:21.791]  Authorities said on Saturday that the main international airport would be shut at least until Monday, and at this point with the standoff continuing, no one can really
[01:01:22.543 --> 01:01:24.789]  Vision, the airport's hoping until midweek.
[01:01:24.909 --> 01:01:27.235]  The protesters want the government to resign.
[01:01:27.255 --> 01:01:30.001]  This is IRN USA Radio News.
[01:01:31.394 --> 01:01:35.496]  If you've been watching the news lately, you've been hearing a lot about the obstacles in our economy.
[01:01:35.876 --> 01:01:44.821]  If you'll listen for just a few seconds, I'll share the opportunities that this economic downturn is offering to those with the energy, courage, and know-how to take advantage of it.
[01:01:45.422 --> 01:01:46.902]  Hi, how in the world are you anyway?
[01:01:47.163 --> 01:01:50.424]  I'm Andy Willoughby with the 3-Step Plan Home Business System.
[01:01:50.805 --> 01:01:55.127]  The 3-Step Plan helps people feel better, look better, and make more money.
[01:01:55.587 --> 01:01:59.871]  History has shown that our product line actually grows during an economic slowdown.
[01:02:00.191 --> 01:02:07.497]  Our newest product category actually grew 21% during the last 12 months, while most business categories were dropping like a rock.
[01:02:08.012 --> 01:02:16.816]  With the 3-Step Plan you can help yourself and others develop another stream of income to survive and prosper in today's uncertain business climate.
[01:02:17.156 --> 01:02:18.717]  Don't wait for things to get worse.
[01:02:19.097 --> 01:02:20.998]  Check out the 3-Step Plan today.
[01:02:21.338 --> 01:02:23.519]  Go to 3stepplan.com or call 800-480-2102.
[01:02:23.539 --> 01:02:23.579]  800-480-2102.
[01:02:31.718 --> 01:02:37.264]  Today's first possible landing time for the shuttle Endeavour has been scratched at the Kennedy Space Center.
[01:02:37.764 --> 01:02:40.908]  The touchdown is now scheduled for 2.54 p.m.
[01:02:40.988 --> 01:02:41.669]  Eastern Time.
[01:02:42.169 --> 01:02:46.554]  The problem is weather, with high winds and possible thunderstorms in the forecast.
[01:02:47.327 --> 01:02:49.248]  The landing could be delayed until tomorrow.
[01:02:49.809 --> 01:02:51.970]  Brian Lunney is a NASA flight director.
[01:02:52.090 --> 01:02:57.634]  We're going to be evaluating that and checking out the weather at KSC, making sure that it's a good, safe place to go land.
[01:02:57.674 --> 01:03:02.157]  And if it's not, we'll look at Monday, we'll look at Edwards and decide then where to go.
[01:03:02.177 --> 01:03:09.242]  And it appears a program that provides government-authorized heroin to hardened addicts in Switzerland will become permanent.
[01:03:09.924 --> 01:03:12.165]  Projections show voters approving it by 69%.
[01:03:12.846 --> 01:03:19.189]  And the New York City Transit System doesn't want subway commuters to get in trouble with teachers or bosses.
[01:03:19.589 --> 01:03:24.732]  That's why they're giving out excuse notes to people who are late for school or work due to subway delays.
[01:03:25.492 --> 01:03:29.294]  For more news and analysis, log on to IRNnews.com.
[01:03:31.269 --> 01:03:33.770]  This Christmas, give a gift that's a double blessing.
[01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:36.930]  A gift that helps the poor and opens the door for the gospel.
[01:03:37.130 --> 01:03:42.992]  When you bless a poor family in Asia with a goat, a chicken, or a water buffalo, you provide them a source of income.
[01:03:43.172 --> 01:03:47.653]  And through Gospel for Asia, you also open the door to share the good news of Jesus.
[01:03:47.973 --> 01:03:50.714]  This Christmas, give a gift that's a double blessing.
[01:03:50.794 --> 01:03:54.635]  Click the Gospel for Asia's Christmas gift catalog banner at pointofview.net or call 800-613-5570.
[01:03:54.655 --> 01:03:54.855]  That's 800-613-5570.
[01:04:01.713 --> 01:04:08.387]  President-elect Barack Obama is turning a once bitter political rivalry into a high-level partnership.
[01:04:09.096 --> 01:04:10.177]  Here's Bob Eller.
[01:04:10.337 --> 01:04:20.864]  Advisors say Obama has for several months envisioned Hillary Clinton as his top diplomat, and Democratic officials say he will announce at a Chicago news conference he's nominating her.
[01:04:21.384 --> 01:04:34.672]  While some Democrats and government insiders have questioned whether Clinton is too independent and too politically ambitious to serve, advisors say the president-elect believes Clinton brings instant stature and credibility to U.S.
[01:04:34.692 --> 01:04:38.455]  diplomatic efforts, and that outweighs any political downside.
[01:04:38.975 --> 01:04:40.116]  Bob Eller, Washington.
[01:04:40.257 --> 01:04:45.021]  It could be a miserable drive home for many holiday travelers along the East Coast.
[01:04:45.442 --> 01:04:55.412]  And flying as well, like out of Philadelphia, where international airport spokesman Victoria Lupka says heavy rains are causing two-hour delays for some flights.
[01:04:55.652 --> 01:05:05.019]  We certainly recommend that our travelers and anyone who's picking up or dropping off, check the status of their flights by contacting their airline directly.
[01:05:05.179 --> 01:05:10.783]  Some snow in New York State and the southern portion of the Great Lakes region could also cause a problem.
[01:05:11.524 --> 01:05:17.428]  Jesse Ayazana says he got up at 5.30 this morning to catch a flight from New York home.
[01:05:17.749 --> 01:05:20.831]  It's not fun waking up this early to get on a plane ever.
[01:05:21.371 --> 01:05:24.934]  Elsewhere around the country, the weather is much more promising.
[01:05:25.939 --> 01:05:29.742]  I'm Jody Jordan for IRN USA Radio News.
[01:05:29.762 --> 01:05:32.824]  The headlines are clear.
[01:05:32.844 --> 01:05:35.385]  The worldwide economic collapse is here.
[01:05:35.786 --> 01:05:38.327]  The military is being positioned for martial law.
[01:05:39.008 --> 01:05:40.649]  The mark of the beast is at hand.
[01:05:40.769 --> 01:05:44.051]  Governments are calling for a new world cashless economic system.
[01:05:44.071 --> 01:05:47.654]  Having a long-term food solution is your only hope to stay free.
[01:05:48.734 --> 01:05:52.157]  Now, Survival of Seeds introduces their Escape the Beast Kit.
[01:05:52.377 --> 01:05:55.700]  24 varieties of all-natural, non-genetically modified heirloom seeds.
[01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:58.482]  For true patriots and homesteaders wanting food insurance.
[01:05:58.622 --> 01:06:02.766]  That's over 5 pounds of rare historic seeds for a penny per seed.
[01:06:02.786 --> 01:06:06.429]  15,000 seeds that will feed a family healthy food for 7 years.
[01:06:06.449 --> 01:06:15.456]  Big John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me, is including an instructional DVD that will teach you how to earn big money selling the produce from his incredible heirloom seeds back to him.
[01:06:15.576 --> 01:06:17.037]  Restaurants and small delis.
[01:06:17.077 --> 01:06:17.958]  Don't buy from copycats.
[01:06:18.058 --> 01:06:20.780]  Prepare yourself for a talk radio experience like no other.
[01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:21.880]  He stands for truth.
[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:23.481]  He stands for justice.
[01:06:48.092 --> 01:06:50.434]  He stands for what's right.
[01:06:50.554 --> 01:06:52.896]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:53.837 --> 01:06:56.700]  Call Alex now, toll free at 877-590-5525.
[01:06:56.760 --> 01:07:00.863]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[01:07:09.355 --> 01:07:15.497]  We are locked and loaded on this 30th day of November 2008 in our number two.
[01:07:15.877 --> 01:07:19.539]  Thank you so much for joining us this evening.
[01:07:19.679 --> 01:07:30.343]  Talk about real issues, things that actually affect all of us as free human beings here on this blue marble spinning through the deep dark vastness of the cosmos in the Milky Way.
[01:07:31.503 --> 01:07:35.825]  By the way, I'm going to go back to your calls right now and talk about FEMA with Zsa Zsa from New York.
[01:07:36.745 --> 01:07:38.606]  But last week,
[01:07:39.602 --> 01:07:59.590]  The head of immigration in England, high-level position, was arrested for releasing documents about how the government secretly was legalizing basically all the illegal aliens and putting a bunch of them in high-level government security jobs.
[01:08:00.310 --> 01:08:05.458]  And they arrested him under terrorism charges under these new powers where they don't need any evidence.
[01:08:05.879 --> 01:08:08.543]  Another story here from the Washington Post, up on Drug Report right now.
[01:08:09.043 --> 01:08:11.427]  Police treatment of journalists prompts outcry in France.
[01:08:11.768 --> 01:08:13.771]  Mainline journalists criticizing the government.
[01:08:14.733 --> 01:08:21.319]  The new police wearing armbands came and arrested him, manhandled him, beat him in front of his children, and did sexual things to him.
[01:08:21.359 --> 01:08:22.700]  I can't read out of the Washington Post.
[01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:23.340]  It's too graphic.
[01:08:23.661 --> 01:08:24.621]  In front of his children.
[01:08:24.962 --> 01:08:26.103]  Just like they do on 24.
[01:08:26.583 --> 01:08:27.063]  They teach it.
[01:08:27.124 --> 01:08:29.045]  Torturing people in front of their kids gets answers.
[01:08:29.445 --> 01:08:31.427]  Torturing children in front of their parents gets answers.
[01:08:31.487 --> 01:08:31.667]  See?
[01:08:32.108 --> 01:08:33.509]  Training you to accept evil.
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:37.581]  Twisting your soul, so you'll go along with being oppressed.
[01:08:37.862 --> 01:08:39.642]  That's why the Romans had the gladiatorial events.
[01:08:39.882 --> 01:08:41.983]  To see citizens being killed and murdered.
[01:08:42.323 --> 01:08:43.344]  To make it a spectacle.
[01:08:43.384 --> 01:08:44.384]  To make it acceptable.
[01:08:44.624 --> 01:08:46.045]  This is mind control, folks.
[01:08:47.386 --> 01:08:47.946]  Same thing here.
[01:08:48.752 --> 01:08:52.133]  And then the public turns into, basically, savages.
[01:08:52.193 --> 01:08:57.034]  And they stampede people at Walmart, they fight over goods, they don't care about their neighbors.
[01:08:57.794 --> 01:09:05.376]  And the public, there's not even outcry over, oh, AP reports 90% of the formula has melamine, deadly poison in it.
[01:09:05.936 --> 01:09:09.897]  The FDA comes out and says, well, yeah, it kills people in other countries, but not here.
[01:09:10.157 --> 01:09:11.617]  We're saying it's not bad for you.
[01:09:13.618 --> 01:09:14.018]  That's right.
[01:09:14.178 --> 01:09:14.718]  You heard me right.
[01:09:15.805 --> 01:09:16.686]  It's been a big news item.
[01:09:16.706 --> 01:09:18.347]  I'm sure you've already heard about it separate from the show.
[01:09:18.567 --> 01:09:19.828]  But I want you to check that for yourselves.
[01:09:19.848 --> 01:09:20.609]  That's hard to believe.
[01:09:21.049 --> 01:09:21.570]  It's true, though.
[01:09:25.513 --> 01:09:28.615]  Okay, let's go ahead and go back to Zsa Zsa in New York.
[01:09:28.655 --> 01:09:31.037]  She was talking to a friend who's an engineer with FEMA.
[01:09:31.117 --> 01:09:33.979]  Talked about how compartmentalized it is, how secretive it is.
[01:09:34.419 --> 01:09:37.702]  But mainstream news reports, they built FEMA camps, continued government.
[01:09:37.942 --> 01:09:39.003]  They've secretly hired 26,000 preachers.
[01:09:40.624 --> 01:09:44.646]  On government payroll, to teach their flocks to turn in their guns, submit to government.
[01:09:44.986 --> 01:09:57.631]  We're being set up as the chumps, so when the public finds out that tens of trillions have been stolen, it's 7.8 trillion right now, but it will be tens of trillions, by foreign banks in control of our government, there'll be nothing we can do, because a police state will be in place.
[01:09:58.852 --> 01:10:01.473]  And it'll be okay, because it'll be Barack Obama carrying it out.
[01:10:01.853 --> 01:10:04.394]  Not that wicked George Bush, who helped set it all up.
[01:10:04.935 --> 01:10:06.056]  Because they're on the same team.
[01:10:06.497 --> 01:10:11.401]  Zsa Zsa, go ahead and tell me what your friend at FEMA was telling you was going on.
[01:10:11.922 --> 01:10:15.365]  So what I think, Alex, is that all the trillions are going right to FEMA.
[01:10:15.445 --> 01:10:16.566]  Because what he said to me...
[01:10:17.133 --> 01:10:25.857]  Well that's why FEMA locked down, wouldn't let the National Guard, wouldn't let Walmart, speaking of the devil, wouldn't allow the Coast Guard to bring food in.
[01:10:25.877 --> 01:10:27.477]  They wanted it to fall apart.
[01:10:27.537 --> 01:10:30.539]  This has come out so they could demand more power and more money.
[01:10:46.983 --> 01:10:54.908]  Yeah, because their whole concept is the more facilities they create is because they're expecting pandemonium.
[01:10:55.448 --> 01:10:57.710]  And when all hell breaks loose, that's what the frame is.
[01:10:57.730 --> 01:11:00.511]  But let's be clear, this has all been engineered.
[01:11:01.132 --> 01:11:08.296]  Just like the IMF and World Bank have done this in Iceland and Argentina and countless other countries, they're setting that up here.
[01:11:08.336 --> 01:11:16.421]  You understand they've engineered the collapse, then they will pose as the saviors and things will get so bad the middle class will beg for tyranny.
[01:11:16.921 --> 01:11:17.922]  I explained it to him today.
[01:11:17.962 --> 01:11:19.403]  His mind was totally blown away.
[01:11:19.743 --> 01:11:30.629]  And I said to him, oh, because I was talking about the disasters, and he said to me, yeah, they always said that 2008 had the most amount of natural disasters ever, ever on Earth, on this planet.
[01:11:30.910 --> 01:11:37.854]  And you know, with 1,400 tornadoes, and with 1,500 fires, and all these crazy... And a lot of that is the declassified weather weapons programs.
[01:11:38.214 --> 01:11:38.575]  Of course!
[01:11:38.735 --> 01:11:42.499]  And I said to him about HAWP and I explained... By the way, the Secretary of Defense admits it.
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:45.323]  Going back to Cohen, you just haven't read the Army Times.
[01:11:45.603 --> 01:11:47.465]  They admit they have weather weapons and they've had them.
[01:11:48.658 --> 01:11:54.203]  Yeah, and he said that he overheard Harp a few times in the higher-ups, and he didn't quite figure it out.
[01:11:54.403 --> 01:11:57.146]  And when I explained it to him, he said, well, now I'm really going to keep my ears open.
[01:11:57.786 --> 01:11:59.007]  But what else did he say?
[01:11:59.027 --> 01:12:02.571]  They have shut down shopping malls, shut down facilities everywhere?
[01:12:03.071 --> 01:12:05.994]  Yes, everywhere, in more places than you could imagine.
[01:12:06.054 --> 01:12:07.235]  He's on the plane all the time.
[01:12:07.295 --> 01:12:12.800]  He's actually trying to help people assess things and give people money for all the damage that they've created by Harp.
[01:12:13.340 --> 01:12:16.362]  You know, and actually, he said that there's something going on.
[01:12:16.563 --> 01:12:17.523]  They've already planned.
[01:12:17.803 --> 01:12:19.905]  They said that there's something going to be happening in the Dakotas.
[01:12:20.085 --> 01:12:21.186]  There's an earthquake warning.
[01:12:21.946 --> 01:12:24.588]  And he's, and this is very serious, because they're all talking about it.
[01:12:25.389 --> 01:12:30.653]  And then he also said that he is personally going to, they're building a lot of facilities now in Idaho.
[01:12:31.554 --> 01:12:35.416]  But, you know, he's helping people over in Baton Rouge and over in Ike.
[01:12:36.237 --> 01:12:38.859]  Yeah, they're helping them by confiscating their guns, like they did.
[01:12:39.833 --> 01:12:41.734]  Well, yeah, totally right.
[01:12:41.774 --> 01:12:43.475]  Not this guy, but um... No, I understand.
[01:12:43.516 --> 01:12:44.696]  It's all compartmentalizing him.
[01:12:45.017 --> 01:12:45.677]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:12:45.737 --> 01:12:46.578]  But he didn't even know.
[01:12:46.638 --> 01:12:47.058]  He was like, what?
[01:12:47.218 --> 01:12:48.179]  And then he said, he did.
[01:12:48.219 --> 01:12:54.143]  We were told once that he had a government phone and it's monitored by Mount Weather.
[01:12:54.523 --> 01:12:59.046]  And if you do anything wrong, he said, the guy, the entire episode, you're out.
[01:12:59.506 --> 01:13:00.287]  And he gave me a look.
[01:13:00.507 --> 01:13:01.468]  I said, what, was he joking?
[01:13:01.508 --> 01:13:01.868]  He said, no.
[01:13:04.199 --> 01:13:10.461]  That's why ABC News a month ago announced, yes, we listen to the government, people have phone sex.
[01:13:10.521 --> 01:13:12.002]  We listen to the public have phone sex.
[01:13:12.382 --> 01:13:18.224]  They said that specifically to humiliate the public and to throw it in our face that we're all being watched.
[01:13:18.718 --> 01:13:23.422]  Well, I had spoken to a Time Warner guy in my neighborhood, and I said, so what's with the new digital boxes?
[01:13:23.762 --> 01:13:25.203]  I said, do they have cameras in them or what?
[01:13:25.444 --> 01:13:33.030]  He said, actually they do, but they're only being used in certain, they all have the facilities and the feature to do it, but only in certain areas.
[01:13:33.070 --> 01:13:37.954]  Look, 15 years ago, the scientific Atlantic cable box had a microphone in it.
[01:13:37.974 --> 01:13:39.095]  Nobody was even told about it.
[01:13:39.335 --> 01:13:40.196]  And remember TiVo?
[01:13:41.196 --> 01:13:41.757]  Yeah, of course.
[01:13:42.381 --> 01:13:46.304]  They admit that they track everything you watch and what you do, and it's used for marketing.
[01:13:46.324 --> 01:13:46.984]  Good to hear from you.
[01:13:47.324 --> 01:13:48.565]  I'm going to jam one more in here.
[01:13:49.226 --> 01:13:51.307]  Let's go ahead and go to Mike in New Jersey.
[01:13:51.327 --> 01:13:52.188]  You're on the air, Mike.
[01:13:52.888 --> 01:13:53.689]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:13:53.729 --> 01:13:54.009]  Good.
[01:13:54.589 --> 01:14:00.213]  Yeah, my wife and her daughter, they went to Walmart, and it was like, you know, like Black Friday and stuff like that.
[01:14:00.233 --> 01:14:05.016]  And they had three incidents over there where they're stealing the pocketbooks off the women and stuff like that.
[01:14:05.036 --> 01:14:07.658]  And she only recurs only like three, but there could have been more.
[01:14:08.530 --> 01:14:08.831]  Over there.
[01:14:08.891 --> 01:14:10.473]  And the whole society is unraveling.
[01:14:10.693 --> 01:14:11.554]  The government is corrupt.
[01:14:11.574 --> 01:14:12.475]  The people are corrupt.
[01:14:12.996 --> 01:14:16.520]  And the good people have been trained to accept it and be passive.
[01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:17.781]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:14:17.901 --> 01:14:18.302]  Absolutely.
[01:14:18.342 --> 01:14:19.744]  And one other question before I go.
[01:14:19.824 --> 01:14:26.552]  On Obama, do you think that it's possible, if things don't work out, that they may also assassinate him?
[01:14:27.082 --> 01:14:30.203]  To create another incident in the United States?
[01:14:30.623 --> 01:14:35.645]  Anybody that doesn't follow New World Order crime syndicate orders is killed in their system.
[01:14:35.985 --> 01:14:37.105]  That's why they killed Kennedy.
[01:14:37.365 --> 01:14:39.366]  But Obama, look at who he's appointed.
[01:14:39.986 --> 01:14:56.771]  The very bankers, Robert Rubin's people, Summers, all of them, the very people that changed the Glass-Steagall Act to allow the banks to leverage, to allow them to sell these AAA rated junk securities, the very people that caused this are the ones now coming into power.
[01:14:57.371 --> 01:15:07.218]  And he's saying he's gonna warmonger, he's gonna keep spying on us without warrants, he's gonna have domestic spy forces, I mean... He'll go against his own people.
[01:15:07.498 --> 01:15:08.939]  They control both parties!
[01:15:08.959 --> 01:15:10.661]  I hear ya, I hear ya.
[01:15:10.961 --> 01:15:13.162]  Listen, I won't take any more of your time, it was very nice talking to you.
[01:15:13.182 --> 01:15:15.564]  Hey, great hearing from you sir, I really appreciate your call.
[01:15:15.584 --> 01:15:17.926]  Alright, I'm gonna talk to David.
[01:15:18.743 --> 01:15:18.984]  I think.
[01:15:29.361 --> 01:15:31.181]  It's even a little bit more fired up than my weekday show.
[01:15:31.201 --> 01:15:34.522]  On the weekday show, I'm really able to, from 11 to 3 p.m.
[01:15:34.562 --> 01:15:37.563]  every day, to really go over everything in more detail.
[01:15:38.043 --> 01:15:39.723]  I mean, there's so much news I've got here.
[01:15:39.803 --> 01:15:50.846]  I would love to talk for just two hours today about the fact that the Associated Press is reporting 90% of the baby formula consumed in the United States has melamine in it.
[01:15:52.466 --> 01:15:53.087]  Melamine.
[01:15:53.267 --> 01:15:53.807]  Poison.
[01:15:54.667 --> 01:15:56.287]  It is deadly poison.
[01:15:57.528 --> 01:15:58.888]  And nothing's being done about it.
[01:15:59.582 --> 01:16:00.323]  Nothing's stopping.
[01:16:00.663 --> 01:16:07.007]  I mean, they, overnight, could change the procedures and not have this happen, but they just don't care.
[01:16:07.548 --> 01:16:18.916]  Not to mention, the plastics that we drink out of have the estrogen-mimicking hormones, and that's what's giving women the breast cancer, that's what's making men feminine and not masculine.
[01:16:19.456 --> 01:16:26.561]  We'll break it all down when we get back, and your phone calls, right here, on the Alex Jones Show, InfoWars.com.
[01:16:30.686 --> 01:16:36.109]  With Christmas right around the corner and an unstable economy looming, finding the right gift can be tough.

[01:20:22.445 --> 01:20:22.485]  866-598-7396.
[01:20:32.811 --> 01:20:35.079]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:35.741 --> 01:20:37.588]  Home to hard-hitting talk radio.
[01:20:44.242 --> 01:20:59.149]  I could go over thousands of different ways the social engineers setting up the world government for at least a hundred years have been controlling Europe and the United States and using our energy, our wealth, our money, our ingenuity to dominate the planet for them.
[01:20:59.689 --> 01:21:10.454]  Now they're done with us and they're imploding our economy to bring in a police state and total control and even more hardcore social engineering along the lines of hyper eugenics.
[01:21:11.849 --> 01:21:12.750]  Here's a quick example.
[01:21:13.150 --> 01:21:26.103]  Not only, according to the Associated Press and other groups that have had major firms tested, like Abbott Laboratories, conducting its own in-house test that detected levels of melamine in formula products.
[01:21:26.143 --> 01:21:31.328]  Together, the infant formula manufacturers make about 90% of the infant formulas sold in the United States.
[01:21:31.608 --> 01:21:32.649]  That's Associated Press.
[01:21:34.210 --> 01:21:36.753]  Not only that issue, or the FDA,
[01:21:37.836 --> 01:21:42.558]  Food and Drug Administration coming out and saying, well, since it's in all these foods and things, we're just going to say it's not bad for you.
[01:21:44.258 --> 01:21:45.579]  That's not even the biggest issue.
[01:21:46.899 --> 01:21:54.242]  This is Edward Bernays, hired by the Pentagon, hired by the Department of Commerce when it was set up.
[01:21:55.543 --> 01:21:57.223]  This is all declassified.
[01:21:58.044 --> 01:22:00.345]  They said, we want to break down the family.
[01:22:00.525 --> 01:22:01.565]  This is back in the forties.
[01:22:02.225 --> 01:22:04.066]  How do we destroy the American family?
[01:22:05.146 --> 01:22:06.367]  Because we want people
[01:22:07.216 --> 01:22:09.157]  Dependent on government, we want people dumbed down.
[01:22:09.337 --> 01:22:12.898]  Families, people owe allegiance to their families.
[01:22:13.418 --> 01:22:18.439]  Families foster strong, intelligent, informed, dynamic people that will stand up for liberty.
[01:22:18.779 --> 01:22:22.320]  How do we militarily, this is all done cold-bloodedly, dumb them down?
[01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:23.640]  They said you break up their families.
[01:22:24.141 --> 01:22:27.281]  You pay money to the women, not to have the men in the houses.
[01:22:27.762 --> 01:22:29.142]  They first targeted the black community.
[01:22:29.522 --> 01:22:32.903]  They went from 90 plus percent legitimacy, 90 plus percent,
[01:22:33.883 --> 01:22:35.805]  Of the children being born to blacks.
[01:22:35.845 --> 01:22:37.466]  We're a two-parent home.
[01:22:38.307 --> 01:22:40.749]  To now over 90% illegitimacy today.
[01:22:41.269 --> 01:22:42.430]  But they've done that to all communities.
[01:22:42.450 --> 01:22:44.592]  They said, condition them in the media.
[01:22:44.632 --> 01:22:45.913]  Tell women they're enslaved.
[01:22:45.953 --> 01:22:48.035]  Tell women they're beaten down.
[01:22:48.355 --> 01:22:51.417]  Tell women they're being oppressed by men if they breastfeed.
[01:22:52.138 --> 01:22:53.739]  That way we get them into the workforce.
[01:22:54.420 --> 01:22:56.762]  That way we get to tax the man and the woman.
[01:22:56.982 --> 01:23:00.324]  And then they're too exhausted when they get home to educate their own children.
[01:23:00.384 --> 01:23:02.106]  Then we'll expand the hours of class.
[01:23:02.873 --> 01:23:06.595]  We'll encourage them with after school to keep their children in the facilities.
[01:23:06.895 --> 01:23:10.677]  Then in the schools we can dumb the curriculum down through compartmentalization.
[01:23:10.717 --> 01:23:12.718]  The teachers and administrators will never know.
[01:23:13.138 --> 01:23:13.799]  And look what they've done.
[01:23:13.819 --> 01:23:17.861]  From the smartest in the world, the highest test scores, to what, 34th in the world now.
[01:23:18.521 --> 01:23:21.322]  Not just behind all the first world nations, but a bunch of third world nations.
[01:23:23.283 --> 01:23:25.324]  And also, Google these studies.
[01:23:25.344 --> 01:23:26.365]  There's been hundreds done.
[01:23:26.925 --> 01:23:32.468]  Smaller brain size in babies that are not breastfed.
[01:23:33.849 --> 01:23:35.090]  Yeah, we're human beings.
[01:23:35.650 --> 01:23:38.292]  Females of Homo Sapien Sapien, our species.
[01:23:40.293 --> 01:23:45.457]  Homo Sapien Sapien have mammary glands to produce milk.
[01:23:45.937 --> 01:23:46.897]  Human milk.
[01:23:46.938 --> 01:23:47.758]  I know this is radical.
[01:23:48.939 --> 01:23:51.260]  Human milk that babies drink.
[01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:53.562]  It's designed for them.
[01:23:54.983 --> 01:23:59.426]  And the brain is developing the most it will ever develop per capita.
[01:23:59.446 --> 01:24:01.547]  It only grows for the first five years and your brain's done growing.
[01:24:02.310 --> 01:24:04.352]  In the first 12 months.
[01:24:05.332 --> 01:24:11.656]  And so the baby doesn't get, because the woman's trendy and she's cool and she's going to be in the workforce.
[01:24:12.377 --> 01:24:14.038]  Okay, well then don't have babies, lady!
[01:24:14.939 --> 01:24:18.001]  Or, wait until your child's a year old and then put them in daycare.
[01:24:18.881 --> 01:24:23.064]  Don't just stick them in a crib to sit there and basically shrivel up and never mentally develop.
[01:24:23.084 --> 01:24:25.086]  That's another reason our public is so dumbed down.
[01:24:25.126 --> 01:24:28.908]  Not just the sodium fluoride in the water, which the government put in there to brain damage us by design.
[01:24:28.928 --> 01:24:29.989]  I have the government documents on that.
[01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:31.430]  Cover it in Endgame and other films.
[01:24:32.446 --> 01:24:33.947]  But think about the diabolical nature.
[01:24:34.368 --> 01:24:40.153]  For 50 plus years in this country, the majority of women don't give their babies milk.
[01:24:40.173 --> 01:24:46.338]  And there's other studies that women that don't breastfeed, while they have children, increase in breast cancer.
[01:24:46.358 --> 01:24:48.981]  Because the women are meant, hormonally, to be producing that milk.
[01:24:49.381 --> 01:24:54.786]  The more a woman breastfeeds, the more children she has, the less rate she has in that.
[01:24:56.357 --> 01:24:57.257]  Same thing with abortion.
[01:24:57.657 --> 01:24:58.257]  Google that.
[01:24:58.277 --> 01:24:59.658]  All the government studies, they admit it.
[01:24:59.678 --> 01:25:00.838]  They just don't publicize it.
[01:25:00.898 --> 01:25:11.500]  You have abortions, it massively increases your chances of cervical cancer, of uterine, of ovarian cancer, of fallopian cancer, of vaginal cancer.
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:13.241]  They know this stuff hurts you.
[01:25:13.561 --> 01:25:17.161]  But again, this is how they did it.
[01:25:17.462 --> 01:25:24.243]  How did Edward Bernays in the 20s get women to start smoking cigarettes when less than 1% of women smoked cigarettes was seen as unladylike?
[01:25:25.402 --> 01:25:25.922]  How do they do it?
[01:25:26.362 --> 01:25:27.423]  This is all declassified.
[01:25:27.463 --> 01:25:28.483]  It's taught in advertising.
[01:25:30.724 --> 01:25:31.524]  I took advertising 101.
[01:25:32.024 --> 01:25:33.384]  I only took two years of media.
[01:25:33.624 --> 01:25:35.445]  Two years of advertising, and they taught this.
[01:25:36.005 --> 01:25:41.026]  The first month in the class, Edward Bernays, he's the reason you eat bacon with eggs.
[01:25:41.046 --> 01:25:42.567]  They advertise you gotta have bacon with eggs.
[01:25:43.387 --> 01:25:44.247]  Some things are innocuous.
[01:25:44.267 --> 01:25:44.867]  What's wrong with that?
[01:25:44.887 --> 01:25:46.848]  The point is, now you feel like you gotta have it.
[01:25:48.101 --> 01:25:53.325]  They said, put women out front at these suffrage marches, smoking cigarettes.
[01:25:53.365 --> 01:25:58.628]  Give them free cigarettes, pay the leaders to smoke cigarettes, say it's radical and cool for women to smoke cigarettes.
[01:25:59.029 --> 01:25:59.329]  Boom!
[01:25:59.349 --> 01:26:00.670]  Total conversion, women smoking.
[01:26:02.011 --> 01:26:05.153]  See, via a fake counterculture telling you it's radical.
[01:26:05.273 --> 01:26:06.834]  There's thousands of these examples I can give you.
[01:26:07.014 --> 01:26:12.598]  And they told the women in the 40s, hey, your men have been gone, you've been in the factories, stay in the factories.
[01:26:14.443 --> 01:26:17.869]  Don't let your men suppress you, and don't breastfeed those babies.
[01:26:18.069 --> 01:26:19.432]  We have scientific formula.
[01:26:19.752 --> 01:26:22.818]  It's good for them, just like that ad's telling you cigarettes were good for your lungs.
[01:26:23.739 --> 01:26:24.400]  Total lies.
[01:26:24.421 --> 01:26:25.222]  They knew it was a lie.
[01:26:25.834 --> 01:26:36.758]  And then you have a nation of people, the vast majority of them, over 60% that were given formula, not breast milk, and their brains, on average, or different studies, are 15% smaller.
[01:26:37.458 --> 01:26:46.402]  The brain didn't get the proper fats and amino acids it needed to grow that key organ in that baby.
[01:26:47.102 --> 01:26:47.702]  It gets worse.
[01:26:47.762 --> 01:26:49.403]  The UN ships in the formula to Africa.
[01:26:49.683 --> 01:26:51.644]  Google formula kills thousands in Africa.
[01:26:52.104 --> 01:26:52.684]  Just kills them.
[01:26:53.311 --> 01:26:55.194]  Because they won't even put the fat in those.
[01:26:55.694 --> 01:27:00.220]  Here they just put melamine in it, and then it's also in plastic bottles that leach.
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:03.745]  There were hundreds of different types of plastic, only one type leached.
[01:27:04.946 --> 01:27:10.594]  And I have the government documents from the 30's where they said we need to adopt this, this will decrease sperm counts, this will
[01:27:11.371 --> 01:27:23.761]  Cause women to have all sorts of reproductive problems, and that's now why we have an 80 plus percent reduction in the sperm count in the United States, in Europe, in England, in every nation that has adopted this.
[01:27:24.061 --> 01:27:29.326]  Japan figured it out a decade ago and banned the stuff, heavily restricted it, but not here.
[01:27:30.146 --> 01:27:37.172]  It comes out, this is in almost all the plastic products and linings and cans and the stuff on the tops of plates, you put it in the microwave, it leaches out,
[01:27:37.805 --> 01:27:39.325]  You wonder why you're so unhealthy?
[01:27:39.345 --> 01:27:40.866]  Why you have all these hormonal problems?
[01:27:41.066 --> 01:27:42.206]  All these adrenal problems?
[01:27:42.386 --> 01:27:45.627]  You wonder why you have all of these problems with your thyroid?
[01:27:46.167 --> 01:27:57.751]  All not linked, conclusively proven from the leaching of that plastic that releases an estrogen mimicking hormone to make men more feminine and women hyper feminine.
[01:27:57.911 --> 01:28:00.631]  That's why you got three and four year old girls going into puberty now.
[01:28:00.811 --> 01:28:02.592]  And when they go to the doctor, does the doctor say,
[01:28:03.706 --> 01:28:05.867]  Hey, don't eat out of this plastic.
[01:28:06.108 --> 01:28:07.108]  Don't heat up plastic.
[01:28:07.449 --> 01:28:08.809]  Don't use these types of plastic.
[01:28:09.330 --> 01:28:13.473]  No, he says, I'll give you hormones to mask those that totally screw the girls up.
[01:28:13.693 --> 01:28:14.713]  And not because the doctor's bad.
[01:28:14.893 --> 01:28:15.934]  He's compartmentalized.
[01:28:16.194 --> 01:28:22.679]  The American Medical Association tells him in his yearly or every two-year retraining that this is what you do when this happens.
[01:28:22.879 --> 01:28:27.402]  He goes and opens up a big book or pulls up a computer website that tells him what to do!
[01:28:29.693 --> 01:28:33.574]  We're going to go to break and come back in a few minutes and go to David, Ralph, Peter, Steven, Ian and others.
[01:28:34.355 --> 01:28:35.275]  So everybody stay with us.
[01:28:35.295 --> 01:28:36.295]  But listen to me.
[01:28:36.335 --> 01:28:37.676]  There's thousands of these things.
[01:28:37.976 --> 01:28:39.477]  I'm only telling you about one thing.
[01:28:39.757 --> 01:28:45.259]  Mothers, if you're going to have children, at least don't give them baby formula.
[01:28:45.559 --> 01:28:47.139]  Goat's milk is dynamite.
[01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:51.561]  It is the next closest thing to human milk next to jackass, donkey milk.
[01:28:52.463 --> 01:29:01.491]  Donkey milk is the very best, and it's just shown in German studies and other studies, Swiss studies, pull them up, to be almost as good as human milk.
[01:29:01.771 --> 01:29:02.892]  Some studies show better.
[01:29:03.653 --> 01:29:05.294]  Go find jackass milk.
[01:29:05.414 --> 01:29:06.295]  Make a market for it.
[01:29:06.315 --> 01:29:09.658]  They've got goat's milk in all these stores in every major city.
[01:29:10.259 --> 01:29:12.761]  Give your babies jackass milk!
[01:29:13.081 --> 01:29:15.943]  Give your babies milk from another mammal!
[01:29:16.404 --> 01:29:17.545]  Not out of a factory!
[01:29:18.436 --> 01:29:19.978]  Why do I have to explain this?
[01:29:20.219 --> 01:29:21.921]  That's why you can't understand me!
[01:29:22.021 --> 01:29:25.846]  Because you didn't get milk from your mama!
[01:29:26.167 --> 01:29:26.928]  We'll be right back!
[01:29:30.746 --> 01:29:34.028]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:29:34.188 --> 01:29:38.270]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:29:38.430 --> 01:29:49.875]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[01:29:50.095 --> 01:29:55.918]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[01:29:56.018 --> 01:29:56.478]  I think so.
[01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:21.035]  If your body isn't feeling too well these days, you're going to start taking this hemp.
[01:30:21.135 --> 01:30:22.917]  I say go to hempusa.org.
[01:30:40.752 --> 01:30:45.236]  You may not like what I'm about to say, but you know I'm gonna say it anyway.
[01:30:45.256 --> 01:30:47.657]  The government doesn't want the best for you.
[01:30:48.018 --> 01:30:50.159]  They keep you down, they keep you blue.
[01:30:50.460 --> 01:30:53.322]  They starve your body for all its nutrients.
[01:30:55.383 --> 01:30:57.465]  They won't let you grow industrial hemp.
[01:30:57.825 --> 01:31:03.209]  It really doesn't make any kind of sense when it's so healthy for the world and useful for you, my friends.
[01:31:05.112 --> 01:31:09.634]  I hope Mr. Bush will hear this song, for the heart of America wants this one.
[01:31:09.674 --> 01:31:14.456]  Go to hempusa.org.
[01:31:14.516 --> 01:31:19.418]  If you're a truther, an anarchist, a renegade, you only want things that God has made.
[01:31:19.458 --> 01:31:23.940]  Go to hempusa.org.

[01:32:29.904 --> 01:32:39.010]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[01:32:39.170 --> 01:32:47.216]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[01:32:47.336 --> 01:32:50.258]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of

[01:33:44.003 --> 01:33:50.006]  A lot of you out there are experts on the BCS and which football team should get the number one ranking.
[01:33:50.366 --> 01:33:51.266]  I'm not an expert on that.
[01:33:51.306 --> 01:33:52.907]  I'm an expert on how the world really works.
[01:33:52.987 --> 01:34:07.633]  And see, I'm going to go to your calls in one minute, but the point is, every issue I bring up, like how they got women into the workforce, forced them into it, now they tax us so heavily, the economy's set up where you have to work, women have figured out it was a scam, too late now.
[01:34:09.534 --> 01:34:10.554]  We've been de-industrialized.
[01:34:10.574 --> 01:34:12.135]  We've been set up by the social engineers.
[01:34:12.788 --> 01:34:16.149]  But, you know, I say go out and get donkey milk, go out and get goat's milk.
[01:34:16.189 --> 01:34:17.990]  You can get goat's milk most places.
[01:34:18.930 --> 01:34:26.372]  Only some rural areas and the really bigger cities that have places that specialize in that have the jackass milk, the donkey milk, which is the very best.
[01:34:27.533 --> 01:34:37.636]  The problem is, though, the regulators force them to then pasteurize the goat's milk, pasteurize the donkey milk, and so then babies, it's been boiled, it's been cooked.
[01:34:38.391 --> 01:34:43.713]  It's had all the live enzymes killed, and so then most babies can't hold that down, just like they can't hold down cow's milk.
[01:34:45.074 --> 01:34:48.695]  Did you know cows don't even release the same type of milk they released a hundred years ago from breeding?
[01:34:49.055 --> 01:34:55.298]  There was a few percentage points of cows that had a different type of milk, a thinner milk, and it's like blood types.
[01:34:55.578 --> 01:34:57.519]  You can go pull it all up, all the specifics.
[01:34:58.665 --> 01:35:00.966]  It's similar to that to where this other type of milk.
[01:35:01.347 --> 01:35:03.048]  Cow milk used to be a lot better for you than it is now.
[01:35:03.548 --> 01:35:05.549]  And I've seen all the major studies on this pull them up.
[01:35:05.889 --> 01:35:09.691]  By the 50s they made all the major dairies pasteurized.
[01:35:09.751 --> 01:35:10.371]  Now what did that do?
[01:35:10.411 --> 01:35:12.032]  Before you had to make sure the milk's clean.
[01:35:12.312 --> 01:35:12.973]  You ever milk cows?
[01:35:13.013 --> 01:35:13.233]  I have.
[01:35:14.597 --> 01:35:25.019]  You go in there, and of the cow, you're putting the nozzles on there, the cow kicks something over, or cow manure gets into the feed, you've got to dump all that milk out.
[01:35:25.139 --> 01:35:26.480]  You've got to keep all that stuff clean.
[01:35:26.820 --> 01:35:38.762]  But with pasteurization, they can just pump the blood, the filth, that's what there's blood and pus, because they over milk these cows, into there, and then they just boil it all and cook it all down, the manure and everything, in there.
[01:35:40.102 --> 01:35:41.523]  Like they give you rotten beef now.
[01:35:41.563 --> 01:35:42.943]  Their answer is, radiate it.
[01:35:44.321 --> 01:35:47.622]  They give you rotten lunch meat, starts killing a bunch of people.
[01:35:47.942 --> 01:35:52.003]  Five, six years ago, they say, we'll just spray bacteria-eating viruses.
[01:35:52.064 --> 01:35:52.704]  Oh, don't believe me?
[01:35:53.004 --> 01:35:53.444]  Google that.
[01:35:55.125 --> 01:35:56.745]  Viruses sprayed on meat.
[01:35:57.845 --> 01:35:58.546]  Print that for me.
[01:35:58.566 --> 01:36:01.086]  There's this computer in here I didn't print, for some reason.
[01:36:02.047 --> 01:36:03.327]  I want to read that on there before I leave.
[01:36:03.367 --> 01:36:04.087]  I'm going to go to your calls.
[01:36:04.147 --> 01:36:06.788]  It's just that, see, they won't even let you have that.
[01:36:06.848 --> 01:36:12.070]  They won't even let you... But see, there's one milk supply they can't stop, and that's you, the mother.
[01:36:12.907 --> 01:36:19.294]  Though they try to have these lactation classes and threaten the mothers, when the nurse comes in when the baby's born, maybe you should put them on formula.
[01:36:19.535 --> 01:36:20.576]  You don't know what you're doing.
[01:36:20.836 --> 01:36:25.562]  Not telling you the baby's weak and always, you know, sometimes it takes two days to nurse, but they're designed to do that.
[01:36:25.922 --> 01:36:27.304]  It's a purification process.
[01:36:27.324 --> 01:36:33.611]  A lot of studies show they shouldn't even be, other than some colostrum, right when they're first born, be eating for a couple days.
[01:36:34.628 --> 01:36:35.689]  They're supposed to lose weight.
[01:36:35.989 --> 01:36:38.191]  Sometimes 10% of their body weight, they tell you that's abnormal.
[01:36:38.491 --> 01:36:41.913]  In some areas of the country, more than half the children are being born by cesarean.
[01:36:42.454 --> 01:36:44.135]  See, they're institutionalizing everything.
[01:36:44.275 --> 01:36:45.456]  You can't have a baby normally.
[01:36:45.656 --> 01:36:46.977]  You can't give them your own milk.
[01:36:47.558 --> 01:36:49.379]  It's all social engineering and control.
[01:36:49.899 --> 01:36:50.900]  Oh, you just found it instantly.
[01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:54.002]  FDA okays bacteria-eating viruses to treat meat.
[01:36:54.022 --> 01:36:58.546]  MSNBC, Associated Press, preparation targets microbes that kill hundreds of people a year.
[01:36:59.352 --> 01:36:59.712]  Well, they don't.
[01:36:59.832 --> 01:37:01.193]  And this came out in 2006.
[01:37:01.373 --> 01:37:02.714]  It's now sprayed on most meats.
[01:37:03.055 --> 01:37:09.559]  And they don't tell you is that it's thousands of times higher than the regular amount of these viruses that normally do kill bacteria.
[01:37:10.180 --> 01:37:10.960]  They say it's natural.
[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:16.204]  They don't tell you they breed these in giant vaccine tanks with other viruses and bacteria and have been linked to a bunch of deaths.
[01:37:16.664 --> 01:37:17.625]  Ah, there it is for you.
[01:37:17.925 --> 01:37:19.106]  Everything I say is documented.
[01:37:19.126 --> 01:37:20.767]  I remember that article from two and a half years ago.
[01:37:21.128 --> 01:37:22.408]  I have a near photographic memory.
[01:37:22.969 --> 01:37:25.411]  Alright, let's go ahead and talk to David in Washington.
[01:37:25.431 --> 01:37:27.332]  David, thanks for holding her on the air worldwide.
[01:37:28.095 --> 01:37:28.955]  Hey, Alex Jones.
[01:37:28.995 --> 01:37:29.776]  Great show, man.
[01:37:29.856 --> 01:37:30.176]  Thank you.
[01:37:30.776 --> 01:37:31.636]  Yeah, I appreciate it.
[01:37:32.556 --> 01:37:36.277]  Hey, uh, I did drink my mom's milk.
[01:37:37.298 --> 01:37:39.698]  Pretty soon they'll say that means you're with Al-Qaeda.
[01:37:41.259 --> 01:37:42.799]  But I did have bacon and eggs, though.
[01:37:42.819 --> 01:37:46.040]  It's not too long ago.
[01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:51.782]  My point is, everything we do, the way we speak, everything we believe we are, was implanted into us by the marketers.
[01:37:52.341 --> 01:37:53.062]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:37:53.242 --> 01:37:53.863]  I'm the first to admit it.
[01:37:53.943 --> 01:37:55.445]  I've been pretty dumbed down.
[01:38:00.467 --> 01:38:01.147]  About a year ago.
[01:38:01.247 --> 01:38:02.287]  Well, television does that.
[01:38:02.307 --> 01:38:13.710]  There are hundreds of studies that watching more than four hours of TV above the age of 60 massively increases, five-fold in one study, seven-fold in another study I saw, Alzheimer's, because your brain mass starts dying at age 30.
[01:38:14.110 --> 01:38:16.931]  You start losing about 40,000 brain cells a day.
[01:38:17.091 --> 01:38:18.371]  Some studies say 35,000, some say 50,000.
[01:38:18.531 --> 01:38:26.453]  But you start losing tens of thousands of brain cells a day, but you have new neural pathways being constantly formed by doing new activities, researching music.
[01:38:26.633 --> 01:38:30.937]  But when you just watch and spectate, watching television, it causes long-term brain damage.
[01:38:31.097 --> 01:38:31.798]  Check it out for yourself.
[01:38:31.838 --> 01:38:32.139]  I'm sorry.
[01:38:32.219 --> 01:38:32.359]  Oh!
[01:38:32.579 --> 01:38:32.679]  Oh!
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:33.580]  Google!
[01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:34.281]  No, no, no!
[01:38:34.301 --> 01:38:34.561]  Stop!
[01:38:34.581 --> 01:38:34.801]  Stop!
[01:38:34.821 --> 01:38:35.402]  Let's do it again!
[01:38:35.722 --> 01:38:39.246]  Google, uh, television watching contributes to Alzheimer's.
[01:38:39.466 --> 01:38:40.106]  Sorry, go ahead, sir.
[01:38:40.126 --> 01:38:41.107]  No, I believe you.
[01:38:41.127 --> 01:38:41.448]  I believe you.
[01:38:41.528 --> 01:38:42.088]  I turned off my TV.
[01:38:42.128 --> 01:38:44.591]  Whereas your mind could be burning with energy and knowledge.
[01:38:44.871 --> 01:38:46.593]  Instead, you just watch PCS!
[01:38:47.414 --> 01:38:48.175]  Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[01:38:48.315 --> 01:38:49.476]  I watch a little C-SPAN.
[01:38:49.496 --> 01:38:50.477]  I watch a little C-SPAN.
[01:38:51.755 --> 01:38:53.756]  I am turning 30 next year, but I am.
[01:38:54.516 --> 01:39:00.438]  I've been dumbed down and I've been awake ever since my stroke that I had a year ago.
[01:39:01.098 --> 01:39:03.638]  I've tuned in to you and listened to Ron Paul.
[01:39:03.658 --> 01:39:04.939]  MSG causes strokes.
[01:39:04.999 --> 01:39:06.519]  I'm sorry about that.
[01:39:07.159 --> 01:39:08.420]  I don't know what it was really.
[01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:19.443]  I don't have too much stress, but anyway, I was calling to actually have you break down the new world order, but you've been doing that and so I don't want to, you know, have you
[01:39:21.031 --> 01:39:25.594]  I guess I want you to do that even more, to break it down even more, but I just kind of have a question.
[01:39:25.614 --> 01:39:32.699]  I'm wondering when you think an actual revolt will take place?
[01:39:33.279 --> 01:39:35.961]  Well, see, I meant to get into that today, but it's very subtle.
[01:39:35.981 --> 01:39:36.882]  I'm going to cover it tomorrow.
[01:39:38.073 --> 01:39:48.803]  The psychological warfare experts have been training us not to have outrage, with more and more crazy announcements like, Mercury's good for you, on the news, and poison toys from China is good.
[01:39:49.024 --> 01:39:50.245]  That's a quote, CNBC.
[01:39:51.066 --> 01:39:54.609]  Or, you know, so what if the government's killing children?
[01:39:54.649 --> 01:39:57.232]  The head of the CPS in Oklahoma said that the other day, I played it on the
[01:39:57.632 --> 01:39:59.253]  Yeah, totally.
[01:40:13.934 --> 01:40:15.774]  It's just like a gospel.
[01:40:15.814 --> 01:40:18.455]  I mean, the breakdown of the New World Order.
[01:40:18.495 --> 01:40:20.336]  You just can't hear it enough, man.
[01:40:20.556 --> 01:40:22.296]  I love it every time you break it down.
[01:40:22.316 --> 01:40:27.337]  Look, it's international private... I appreciate your call.
[01:40:27.377 --> 01:40:33.859]  It's international private corporations combining their forces to destroy nations, bankrupt countries so they can consolidate power.
[01:40:34.685 --> 01:40:36.306]  Okay, I mean that's what the new order is.
[01:40:37.127 --> 01:40:39.408]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ralph in Florida.
[01:40:39.428 --> 01:40:40.289]  You're on the air, Ralph.
[01:40:40.729 --> 01:40:41.650]  Yes, hello, Jones.
[01:40:41.890 --> 01:40:42.270]  Yes, sir.
[01:40:42.290 --> 01:40:43.811]  Yes, hello, Jones.
[01:40:43.851 --> 01:40:44.251]  You hear me?
[01:40:44.671 --> 01:40:44.892]  Over.
[01:40:45.032 --> 01:40:45.212]  Yes.
[01:40:45.914 --> 01:40:46.635]  Yes, okay.
[01:40:46.655 --> 01:40:49.637]  First of all, I would like to thank you for your show.
[01:40:49.937 --> 01:40:52.879]  You don't have to worry about being dumbed down because you're quite intelligent.
[01:40:53.639 --> 01:41:01.404]  I'd also like to say that, you know, your staff, God bless you and your staff for the show that you bring to the nation.
[01:41:01.885 --> 01:41:10.310]  You basically pound this nation, you know, on your back, and very few people in the world, you know, in the United States, basically, understand that.
[01:41:10.951 --> 01:41:14.393]  But all in all, right, this stuff you're talking about,
[01:41:15.836 --> 01:41:24.120]  Ben-Gurion, back in the early fifties, talked about how he wanted to get India and Pakistan to engage each other because it was a threat.
[01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:37.105]  Yeah, that's been official Israeli policy since Ben-Gurion, and that's actually in the news today, is to get India and Pakistan to fight each other, and Israel has been caught funding militant groups to kill Hindus to start that.
[01:41:37.365 --> 01:41:38.945]  I don't know if Israel's involved in this one.
[01:41:39.646 --> 01:41:42.447]  It looks more like ISI through CIA.
[01:41:43.860 --> 01:41:44.120]  Yeah.
[01:41:44.721 --> 01:41:50.244]  And one thing is, can you imagine, I mean, I'm sure you can, but very few people can't.
[01:41:51.885 --> 01:41:59.830]  You know, India and Pakistan engaging each other, two nuclear, you know, two nuclear states, two nuclear powers.
[01:42:00.750 --> 01:42:04.933]  The gorge, the blood, the suffering that would actually be
[01:42:07.561 --> 01:42:14.487]  I mean, did you hear me a month ago and a week ago say that they're going to stage something between Pakistan and India?
[01:42:15.396 --> 01:42:19.861]  I mean exactly what I said happened, because they think the public's dumb.
[01:42:20.121 --> 01:42:23.324]  Obama's people said they were going to go into Pakistan.
[01:42:23.344 --> 01:42:24.786]  Well, they've got to have an excuse to do it.
[01:42:25.066 --> 01:42:26.027]  And this is all in the beginning.
[01:42:26.888 --> 01:42:37.659]  Well, the thing is that you've been following, you've been following, you know, you've been following this organization, this conspiracy for a long time, so you basically, you don't even have to
[01:42:44.121 --> 01:42:47.402]  By the way, speak of the devil, BBC, TV watching makes you obese.
[01:42:47.762 --> 01:42:56.445]  He didn't find the one about Alzheimer's, but it says, uh, compare with other sedentary behaviors, sitting on your butt, TV watching is associated with lower resting metabolic rate.
[01:42:56.585 --> 01:42:58.006]  So you have a lower metabolic rate.
[01:42:58.630 --> 01:43:02.531]  Watching TV than you do sitting in a chair doing nothing, reading a book.
[01:43:02.991 --> 01:43:03.371]  Why?
[01:43:03.711 --> 01:43:05.252]  I'll answer that question when we get back.
[01:43:05.312 --> 01:43:05.992]  God bless you, sir.
[01:43:06.012 --> 01:43:06.672]  I appreciate your call.
[01:43:06.732 --> 01:43:08.353]  All right, we'll talk to Steven.
[01:43:08.993 --> 01:43:09.753]  We'll talk to Peter.
[01:43:09.773 --> 01:43:10.493]  We'll talk to Mark.
[01:43:10.513 --> 01:43:11.053]  We'll talk to Ian.
[01:43:11.713 --> 01:43:14.174]  In fact, Ian, when we get back, stay with me.
[01:43:14.194 --> 01:43:15.654]  But I'll tell you why.
[01:43:16.195 --> 01:43:21.876]  Watching TV, this is government study, gives you a lower metabolic rate
[01:43:22.552 --> 01:43:24.234]  Then sitting still reading a book.
[01:43:24.754 --> 01:43:25.255]  Why?
[01:43:25.595 --> 01:43:27.137]  The answer when we get back.
[01:43:27.217 --> 01:43:30.300]  Stay with us.
[01:43:31.301 --> 01:43:46.156]  Now that the election is over and the shock is beginning to wear off, Ready Reserve Foods, in an effort to get as many Americans prepared for the promised changes of the new administration and to help you and your family survive the global economic crash, Ready Reserve is offering the pre-inauguration special.

[01:44:09.277 --> 01:44:09.838]  Ready Reserve
[01:44:09.838 --> 01:44:10.058]  I think so.
[01:44:30.067 --> 01:44:32.248]  Imagine feeling totally helpless.
[01:44:32.508 --> 01:44:38.532]  Imagine thinking and hearing clearly, but unable to move as the ground rises to meet you.
[01:44:38.792 --> 01:44:48.177]  Imagine the pain of a thousand needles as your body is invaded, locked, and hammered by 50,000 volts of the latest in taser technology.
[01:44:48.377 --> 01:44:55.941]  If this sounds scary, imagine how it would feel for anyone attempting to victimize a friend, loved one, or even yourself.

[01:44:57.842 --> 01:44:58.222]  I don't know.

[01:47:44.207 --> 01:47:45.468]  All right folks, final segment.
[01:47:45.488 --> 01:47:48.010]  I'm going to jam in a whole bunch of your phone calls here at the end.
[01:47:48.730 --> 01:47:54.796]  We googled television watching Alzheimer's.
[01:47:55.016 --> 01:47:55.817]  4,700 articles came up.
[01:47:56.497 --> 01:48:01.582]  Here's just one of the brain and cognition from a major university.
[01:48:01.602 --> 01:48:08.568]  The relationships between television viewing and midlife and the development of Alzheimer's disease in a case-controlled study.
[01:48:10.045 --> 01:48:17.580]  And this is, again, a major international study conducted by a whole bunch of universities in coordination.
[01:48:18.832 --> 01:48:21.214]  Now, I had to go in there and help them Google that.
[01:48:22.335 --> 01:48:25.537]  What they pulled up was something totally separate, but I can speak to that as well.
[01:48:26.137 --> 01:48:27.658]  TV watching makes you obese.
[01:48:27.758 --> 01:48:28.559]  BBC.
[01:48:28.599 --> 01:48:29.099]  Google that.
[01:48:29.119 --> 01:48:30.120]  You can go read it right now.
[01:48:30.741 --> 01:48:33.743]  Scientists have come up with proof that watching television can be bad for your health.
[01:48:34.083 --> 01:48:36.365]  It increases diabetes, obesity, all this.
[01:48:36.405 --> 01:48:45.011]  And it says, Dr. Who said he was not surprised that watching television seems to have such a powerful effect compared with other sedentary behaviors, like reading a book.
[01:48:45.551 --> 01:48:48.253]  TV watching is associated with lower resting metabolic rate.
[01:48:49.146 --> 01:48:50.410]  Okay, now, why is that?
[01:48:51.493 --> 01:48:54.583]  Well, we have studies on that, and we know exactly why that happens.
[01:48:55.313 --> 01:49:03.958]  Because of the wavelength and the flicker rate, on average, it takes about 45 minutes for an adult, even less for a child, to first become hypnotized by television.
[01:49:04.038 --> 01:49:06.399]  Once that happens, it takes a matter of seconds.
[01:49:06.779 --> 01:49:09.381]  Ever caught yourself hours go by, you're drooling watching TV?
[01:49:10.041 --> 01:49:14.784]  It puts you into a lower brain wave, into a sleeping mode.
[01:49:14.844 --> 01:49:20.927]  Now, for some reason, video games, long play video games, where you focus the added concentration
[01:49:21.307 --> 01:49:25.350]  Brings you into a near-death state of oxygen narcosis.
[01:49:25.910 --> 01:49:31.054]  They don't know why, but the brain stops delivering oxygen and you begin simulated death.
[01:49:32.115 --> 01:49:32.715]  Oh, don't believe me?
[01:49:32.735 --> 01:49:33.135]  Google it!
[01:49:33.395 --> 01:49:34.196]  Don't believe me, Paul?
[01:49:34.236 --> 01:49:34.616]  Google it!
[01:49:34.876 --> 01:49:35.897]  Hundreds of studies on that.
[01:49:35.917 --> 01:49:37.818]  People, that's why they're dying playing video games.
[01:49:38.059 --> 01:49:39.119]  And they know all of this.
[01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:43.803]  Because they actually tune the television screens to the most devastating wavelengths.
[01:49:44.823 --> 01:49:48.566]  Got a friend high up in the UT psychology department gave me a tour one time.
[01:49:49.378 --> 01:49:51.240]  Half the thing was all about just flicker rates.
[01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:56.504]  They got these monkeys with wires in their heads and they implant them and they've got flickering screens.
[01:49:56.864 --> 01:49:57.925]  The Pentagon's funding it.
[01:49:57.965 --> 01:49:59.567]  DARPA, just how to control the monkey.
[01:49:59.807 --> 01:50:01.148]  And that testing is for you.
[01:50:01.348 --> 01:50:02.209]  How to devastate.
[01:50:02.369 --> 01:50:03.930]  How to militarily hard hit ya.
[01:50:04.371 --> 01:50:06.753]  You're under military attack, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:07.533 --> 01:50:08.634]  You need to understand that.
[01:50:08.755 --> 01:50:12.818]  This is highly compartmentalized and not even classified.
[01:50:13.726 --> 01:50:15.367]  Hey, you can just laugh at me all day if you want.
[01:50:15.407 --> 01:50:16.727]  This is how a human's supposed to act.
[01:50:16.987 --> 01:50:19.248]  You yell and scream about your football team losing or winning.
[01:50:19.348 --> 01:50:21.169]  I yell and scream about discovering this.
[01:50:22.809 --> 01:50:25.130]  But here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:26.391 --> 01:50:28.691]  A study from 2005, and there are hundreds of them.
[01:50:28.711 --> 01:50:30.572]  You can go read them all for yourself right now, if you care.
[01:50:31.232 --> 01:50:34.313]  Okay, let's go ahead now and go to your calls.
[01:50:34.714 --> 01:50:35.374]  Stephen in New York.
[01:50:35.394 --> 01:50:37.174]  I'm going to give each of you about a minute because I want to get to everybody.
[01:50:37.194 --> 01:50:37.815]  Stephen, go ahead.
[01:50:38.995 --> 01:50:41.336]  I'd like to get your opinion on some info I
[01:50:42.057 --> 01:50:44.959]  I remember about Pakistan, the situation there.
[01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:57.287]  First, I remember when Marianne in Islamabad was bombed, and Zardari was giving a speech, and I was like, seeing that he was smirking, I didn't even take that into account.
[01:50:57.587 --> 01:51:08.995]  And then, I read a story some months after that, it was the commander of CENTCOM, Betrayus, he was talking to some ambassadors, an AP story, and they were just grinning, grinning like it was nothing.
[01:51:09.861 --> 01:51:10.943]  Well, remember about a month ago?
[01:51:23.052 --> 01:51:33.115]  They were having an agreement to do something, I think it was bombings, and then after that, you remember the story, U.S.
[01:51:33.135 --> 01:51:37.856]  had tasked the Pakistani government to do the drone airstrikes?
[01:51:37.936 --> 01:51:38.156]  Yes.
[01:51:38.216 --> 01:51:41.577]  And then I'm like, I'm just thinking, it just seems very strange.
[01:51:41.617 --> 01:51:44.638]  No, no, that's what the Pakistani government... At a level it seems just staged.
[01:51:45.038 --> 01:51:55.076]  You know, just like Hitler and World War II and all the other wars... Yeah, the Pakistani government is saying that their intelligence agencies are run by the U.S., not our government, people that control us.
[01:51:55.885 --> 01:52:02.889]  And that they have staged the attack on India as a pretext for the main government to be overthrown by Pakistani intelligence controlled by the West.
[01:52:03.190 --> 01:52:15.117]  Yes, but it seems like at a level of whatever is going to happen in Pakistan, it seems like both sides are on the same team as always, but... Absolutely great points, good to hear from you, wish we could talk for an hour.
[01:52:15.137 --> 01:52:17.418]  Ian in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:52:17.879 --> 01:52:18.759]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[01:52:18.799 --> 01:52:18.999]  Good.
[01:52:19.019 --> 01:52:23.202]  Yeah, I heard you talking about OpenCarrier earlier, I just wanted to call in and talk about that.
[01:52:24.029 --> 01:52:27.512]  Um, actually started the petition here in Texas about a year ago.
[01:52:27.852 --> 01:52:29.634]  Yeah, we need Vermont style carry.
[01:52:29.994 --> 01:52:31.415]  No classes, no nothing.
[01:52:31.816 --> 01:52:33.417]  You know, the Second Amendment's in force.
[01:52:33.817 --> 01:52:34.958]  Crime rates implode.
[01:52:35.919 --> 01:52:36.900]  Accidents implode.
[01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:38.721]  We need citizens carrying firearms now.
[01:52:39.682 --> 01:52:40.102]  Exactly.
[01:52:40.162 --> 01:52:42.364]  I mean, we can't let our Second Amendment to be ignored.
[01:52:42.524 --> 01:52:46.668]  Yeah, they turn a right into a privilege, and a privilege is something that can be revoked.
[01:52:47.328 --> 01:52:47.688]  Exactly.
[01:52:47.708 --> 01:52:50.050]  The state makes us jump through all these loopholes.
[01:52:50.110 --> 01:52:53.273]  A license is an authorization to do something that would be illegal.
[01:52:53.877 --> 01:52:56.438]  Yeah, it's a right, not a permission.
[01:52:56.978 --> 01:53:05.661]  I've been getting a lot of support with OpenCarrot.org, and we're raising over $10,000, got all these billboards up and everything.
[01:53:06.341 --> 01:53:07.101]  Hey, you know what, Trey?
[01:53:07.141 --> 01:53:07.902]  Let's get this guy on.
[01:53:07.922 --> 01:53:10.823]  I'm going to put you on hold, and we're going to get your name and number.
[01:53:10.843 --> 01:53:13.184]  By the way, before I forget, I want to get Lindsey Williams back on this week.
[01:53:13.464 --> 01:53:16.445]  I had a bunch of brainstorming about guests I want on and then never told you.
[01:53:18.695 --> 01:53:19.095]  Oh, here it is.
[01:53:19.135 --> 01:53:19.635]  Perspectives.
[01:53:19.655 --> 01:53:21.296]  This is your brain on video games.
[01:53:21.796 --> 01:53:23.857]  This is out of CNET News.
[01:53:24.337 --> 01:53:27.998]  Scientists are adding fresh fuel to the debate over video games and violence.
[01:53:29.159 --> 01:53:35.081]  And, uh... Yeah, and it goes into the brain, going into the oxygen state.
[01:53:36.882 --> 01:53:38.402]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:53:38.462 --> 01:53:39.683]  Let's get his name and number.
[01:53:39.723 --> 01:53:41.423]  I've heard about what you're doing, Ian, so I want to have you on.
[01:53:41.743 --> 01:53:42.764]  Peter in California.
[01:53:42.804 --> 01:53:43.744]  You're on the air.
[01:53:43.804 --> 01:53:44.144]  Welcome.
[01:53:45.045 --> 01:53:45.485]  Hey, Alex.
[01:53:45.505 --> 01:53:45.925]  You there?
[01:53:45.945 --> 01:53:46.205]  Yes, sir.
[01:53:47.159 --> 01:54:05.249]  Yes, I don't think you realize that Posse Comitatus was violated at the Ronald Reagan Library two days before President's Day 1993, where the Secret Service and MI5 had secured the area, and the Simi Valley Fire Department just rolled up and said, well, we have authority.
[01:54:05.289 --> 01:54:07.230]  We're going to roll through and stuff.
[01:54:07.270 --> 01:54:09.071]  There was really no need for them to roll through.
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:22.968]  Well, Posse Comitatus, the 1878 law, barring military engaging in law enforcement actions, has been systematically eroded covertly, but now Secretary of Defense Gates has openly announced they're abolishing the National Guard and federalizing it under NORTHCOM.
[01:54:22.988 --> 01:54:27.711]  They're going to station regular army for law enforcement activities on the streets of every city in the United States.
[01:54:28.332 --> 01:54:30.093]  CBS News Associated Press last week.
[01:54:30.882 --> 01:54:40.609]  What happened is this fire truck started to roll forward to go through, and with that, MI5 pulled an automatic weapon on the Simi Valley Fire Department.
[01:54:40.969 --> 01:54:51.256]  Well, they used Russians, MI6, and Israelis and French, Source Newsweek, to kill the Davidians when they firebombed that place in 1993.
[01:54:51.936 --> 01:54:56.239]  So yes, foreign troops can come take part in this action, but citizens are slaves.
[01:54:56.279 --> 01:54:56.759]  Great point.
[01:54:57.020 --> 01:54:58.541]  I'm moving fast to get into everybody here.
[01:54:58.841 --> 01:55:00.682]  Mark in Florida, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:55:01.903 --> 01:55:04.145]  Hi Alex, good to talk with you again.
[01:55:04.425 --> 01:55:08.449]  The thing I'm interested in hearing about is secrecy in government.
[01:55:08.949 --> 01:55:20.480]  What role do you think, as an ongoing thing, that secrecy should play in government since it's obviously been so abused by the National Security Act in 1947?
[01:55:23.791 --> 01:55:26.412]  Well, we've gone way past that now to answer your question.
[01:55:26.752 --> 01:55:34.797]  Now they've transferred more than two-thirds of intelligence gathering against the American people to private corporations and mercenary groups that are violating the Fourth Amendment.
[01:55:35.158 --> 01:55:42.922]  And so, yes, the national security state operating with total anonymity, unlimited funding, bringing in the drugs, is now just taking the whole country over.
[01:55:42.982 --> 01:55:43.303]  Go ahead.
[01:55:43.983 --> 01:55:45.884]  Now, we're all human beings, Alex.
[01:55:45.964 --> 01:55:50.107]  We all have our secrets and our private lives and we want to be able to be private
[01:55:50.783 --> 01:56:03.654]  And, you know, apparently from what I've been listening on your program and just from my own life experiences as well, people like to get into things like secret societies, where they think that they have the code and everything.
[01:56:04.034 --> 01:56:07.577]  Do you think that anybody in a secret society should be in government?
[01:56:08.638 --> 01:56:13.842]  I just think this is an ongoing thing that would be very interesting to hear about systematically in discussion.
[01:56:14.803 --> 01:56:16.325]  You know, we need to debate that further.
[01:56:16.385 --> 01:56:17.846]  I believe in free association.
[01:56:18.940 --> 01:56:20.461]  And it's very dangerous.
[01:56:20.702 --> 01:56:27.927]  You know, the tyranny it would take to stop people being in secret societies and government would be probably greater than the tyranny they're bringing forward.
[01:56:28.148 --> 01:56:36.454]  But I am for exposing them, resisting it, and when they engage in corruption or in mafia tactics, that's a secret society, then they should be brought to justice.
[01:56:36.594 --> 01:56:37.315]  Excellent question.
[01:56:37.615 --> 01:56:39.116]  Again, I just respect all your calls.
[01:56:39.156 --> 01:56:40.017]  I'm sorry I'm going so quick.
[01:56:40.037 --> 01:56:40.718]  I want to get to everybody.
[01:56:41.018 --> 01:56:43.240]  Chuck in North Carolina, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:43.620]  Go ahead.
[01:56:44.815 --> 01:56:51.540]  Hey Alex, your homeschooling material for me, my wife, and my two daughters.
[01:56:51.560 --> 01:57:02.749]  I just want to say one thing I have a problem with is the Jim Morrison's and that type of thing on the show throughout the week.
[01:57:02.769 --> 01:57:07.152]  I wish we could keep it to Merle Haggard and some other better music besides that point.
[01:57:07.192 --> 01:57:11.395]  Well, we do play some classical music, but Trey's in there with his music playing.
[01:57:11.455 --> 01:57:12.536]  I mean, I like a lot of that.
[01:57:12.556 --> 01:57:13.497]  I like the way it sounds.
[01:57:15.065 --> 01:57:21.907]  It's just the ones that profess to be in the Satan and stuff like that, and I know you're not part of that Alex, I love you.
[01:57:22.247 --> 01:57:27.168]  Like I'm saying, just anyways, I wish we could get rid of the Jim Morrison's and stuff like that.
[01:57:27.268 --> 01:57:33.690]  Anyways, North Carolina's talking about putting toll roads on I-77, Georgia's putting toll roads on I-85.
[01:57:33.790 --> 01:57:37.471]  They're seizing our main infrastructure and bringing in total tyranny.
[01:57:37.871 --> 01:57:40.452]  Alex, Mike, and many others, we are out of time.
[01:57:41.032 --> 01:57:41.412]  Sorry.
[01:57:42.012 --> 01:57:43.935]  Be back next Sunday, live, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:57:43.995 --> 01:57:45.697]  Central, 5 to 7 p.m.
[01:57:45.798 --> 01:57:47.640]  Eastern, that's 2 to 4 p.m.
[01:57:47.700 --> 01:57:49.483]  Pacific, 3 to 5 p.m.
[01:57:49.663 --> 01:57:50.284]  Mountain.
[01:57:52.987 --> 01:57:56.893]  Folks, I only covered just the tip of the iceberg, the thin veneer.
[01:57:57.665 --> 01:57:59.486]  There's thousands of other points I can make.
[01:57:59.546 --> 01:58:01.708]  So many things that are going on I want to warn you about.
[01:58:02.028 --> 01:58:04.250]  Understand this, I'm not making any of it up.
[01:58:04.630 --> 01:58:05.991]  All I do is research this.
[01:58:06.171 --> 01:58:08.353]  All I do when I go to sleep is dream about this stuff.
[01:58:08.573 --> 01:58:09.574]  I eat, drink, and sleep it.
[01:58:09.754 --> 01:58:10.735]  It's diabolical.
[01:58:10.895 --> 01:58:11.916]  We've got to come together.
[01:58:12.076 --> 01:58:12.936]  We've got to stop it.
[01:58:13.116 --> 01:58:17.019]  I'll see you on the web at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:58:17.199 --> 01:58:19.021]  Now get out there and take on the tyranny!
[01:58:19.261 --> 01:58:20.582]  Stand up for human liberty!
[01:58:20.902 --> 01:58:25.125]  It's no secret that Genesis Communications Network depends on listeners like you.

[01:58:54.575 --> 01:58:56.476]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[01:58:57.196 --> 01:59:00.358]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[01:59:01.019 --> 01:59:07.482]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.

[01:59:26.918 --> 01:59:40.666]  Ionic Zone shock treatment ozone generators are used by remediation contractors and homeowners alike to sterilize homes and cars, making them free from bacteria, molds, viruses, and complete removal of secondhand smoke, pet odors, you name it.
[01:59:40.886 --> 01:59:44.107]  What else can three oxygen atoms, in other words, ozone, do?
[01:59:44.408 --> 01:59:48.910]  Many hospitals sterilize their operating rooms with ozone before and after operations.
[01:59:49.170 --> 01:59:51.053]  And have you ever heard of ozone therapy?
[01:59:51.273 --> 01:59:54.538]  Ionic Zone has a wealth of information on ozone therapy.
[01:59:54.838 --> 01:59:59.926]  Ozone therapy is used, among other things, to raise the body's oxygen level, which studies suggest
