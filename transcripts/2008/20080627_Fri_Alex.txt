[00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:00.817]  They can read along.
[00:00:01.281 --> 00:00:01.685]  I wanna...
[00:00:04.639 --> 00:00:10.121]  Jordan, we're going to be back on the main radio show in about three minutes, but I didn't want to waste any of the time that we have with you.
[00:00:11.221 --> 00:00:12.982]  So we're on air right now on the web.
[00:00:13.862 --> 00:00:23.625]  I want to walk through for people, because I know you've been immersed in this so long it becomes old hat, but I want to look, going back briefly, at the roots of all of this, and then what's at the top of the pyramid.
[00:00:23.965 --> 00:00:25.746]  Has it been one congruent group?
[00:00:26.086 --> 00:00:29.267]  How many thousands of years has it been congruent?
[00:00:29.307 --> 00:00:31.768]  Because this is a world that's awakening.
[00:00:32.088 --> 00:00:35.009]  Yeah, it's just such a convoluted subject when you want to talk about who's actually in charge.
[00:00:35.029 --> 00:00:35.569]  I would say that
[00:00:57.945 --> 00:01:02.906]  Europe, as I said, for 2,300 years has been at the bottom of all politics.
[00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:10.367]  And, of course, Europe has been the home of the Roman Empire.
[00:01:10.387 --> 00:01:13.408]  And, of course, the Vatican dominates Europe today.
[00:01:13.428 --> 00:01:26.430]  As a matter of fact, we are used to, in this country, hearing about royalty and the princes and Prince Charles and Prince Andrew and the Queen Mum.
[00:01:27.048 --> 00:01:38.778]  But all of that royalty, the entire concept of royalty of Europe, is based on God's, on something called the divine right of kings.
[00:01:38.938 --> 00:01:40.500]  And that's all certified by Rome.
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.081]  That's exactly right.
[00:01:42.221 --> 00:01:44.683]  That's who tells you what God said.
[00:01:44.824 --> 00:01:47.005]  And God said that you are a prince.
[00:01:47.646 --> 00:01:52.150]  Therefore you go to the Vatican, kneel before the holiness, His Holiness the Pope,
[00:01:52.805 --> 00:01:57.386]  And he crowned you, or knights you, into an order of knighthood.
[00:01:57.947 --> 00:02:00.768]  It doesn't matter from what country you come, it doesn't matter.
[00:02:01.008 --> 00:02:03.168]  Rome rules Europe, period.
[00:02:03.328 --> 00:02:14.672]  Okay, okay, well let's, I want to give people just a basic overview who don't understand of why these secret societies are important, where it's going, who they are, and then currently today, top of the pyramid, you're saying
[00:02:16.528 --> 00:02:21.691]  I think that Europe is at the top of the pyramid, and Europe is the problem with America today.
[00:02:21.851 --> 00:02:27.695]  European secret societies are... And at the top of that pyramid, you really think it's the Roman Catholic Church?
[00:02:28.075 --> 00:02:28.616]  I think so.
[00:02:28.896 --> 00:02:29.296]  Okay.
[00:02:29.336 --> 00:02:30.017]  That's my view.
[00:02:30.237 --> 00:02:31.238]  Okay, very interesting.
[00:02:31.558 --> 00:02:34.780]  And do you think they're at war with the Western elites in any way?
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.884]  Because we always... Exactly, because the Knights Templars were their enemy at one of their... Okay, let's explain that.
[00:02:40.924 --> 00:02:41.464]  Let's explain that.
[00:02:41.484 --> 00:02:42.645]  We're going live right now.
[00:02:42.905 --> 00:02:43.225]  Okay.
[00:02:43.285 --> 00:02:43.605]  Here we go.
[00:02:46.778 --> 00:02:47.018]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:02:47.078 --> 00:02:48.479]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:48.659]  800-409-5633.
[00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:52.942]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:03:06.707 --> 00:03:21.157]  Well, I'm going to try to keep Jordan five minutes to the next hour, but then we have state rep Charles Key exposing Oklahoma City as an inside job bombing, and then they've passed resolution to fight the New World Order at the state level, to basically pull out of the union if the New World Order continues to expand.
[00:03:21.757 --> 00:03:23.359]  That is coming up in about an hour.
[00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.261]  Man, time has really flown by with Jordan Maxwell.
[00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:34.694]  Jordan again is a permanent researcher into the core documents of the elite and what makes them tick.
[00:03:35.595 --> 00:03:42.963]  Jordan, give us a tour of the basic history of where all this really starts as best you can tell.
[00:03:43.624 --> 00:03:45.366]  Have they been passing on knowledge?
[00:03:45.566 --> 00:03:46.046]  Do they
[00:03:46.687 --> 00:03:52.772]  Claim they have the secrets of the pyramids in Atlantis and all this, or is that a fable?
[00:03:53.532 --> 00:03:55.394]  How much power do they really have?
[00:03:56.855 --> 00:04:04.660]  You talk about how their main goal, and now they admit this, is to create two species of humanoid, dumb us down, exterminate most of us.
[00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:10.144]  I'm just throwing out the basics here, because broad strokes here in the time we have, and
[00:04:11.005 --> 00:04:14.986]  For the behind-the-scenes viewers of PrisonPlanet.tv, I want to continue that discussion afterwards.
[00:04:15.867 --> 00:04:19.708]  After you finish that with, you believe the Roman Catholic Church is at the very top.
[00:04:19.728 --> 00:04:26.070]  I didn't mean the Roman Catholic adherence to the people, but that system dominating Europe and that it's at war
[00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:35.117]  With the Knights Templars who went to Germany, who went from there into Scotland and then into the United States.
[00:04:35.698 --> 00:04:39.601]  Are those two, the Anglo-American establishment, really waging war with Europe?
[00:04:40.141 --> 00:04:43.124]  Or why on the surface does it look like they're all working together?
[00:04:44.504 --> 00:04:46.545]  Or is that what the New World Order is?
[00:04:46.705 --> 00:04:53.888]  Was the Knights Templars claiming they were going to build a new order, but now it's really just a new order that's run by the Vatican?
[00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:56.529]  Again, this is where all the evidence points.
[00:04:56.549 --> 00:04:57.730]  That's why we're here discussing it.
[00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:05.173]  It doesn't matter if it's TBN with all their weird statues, or Protestants, Catholics, it's all run by the New World Order.
[00:05:05.373 --> 00:05:07.254]  But Jordan was saying there could be some splits there.
[00:05:07.574 --> 00:05:09.155]  So I want to walk through that with his expertise.
[00:05:09.175 --> 00:05:11.535]  But Jordan, that's a long-winded question there.
[00:05:12.816 --> 00:05:15.277]  Try to tackle that, you know, scanning the pyramid.
[00:05:15.317 --> 00:05:21.220]  I mean, let's say you had ten minutes to talk to the world about the structure of it, who they are, why it's important to know.
[00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.501]  Tell us.
[00:05:23.461 --> 00:05:27.343]  Well, I think that it's all one ball of wax.
[00:05:27.543 --> 00:05:37.287]  It's all one operation that goes back thousands of years into the ancient past, a religio-political establishment on the earth.
[00:05:38.528 --> 00:05:40.429]  In the ancient prehistoric world,
[00:05:41.093 --> 00:05:52.037]  The kings were always not only head of government and law, but they also represented the connection between mankind, their followers, and God.
[00:05:52.697 --> 00:05:57.238]  So consequently, they held absolute sovereign power.
[00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:05.461]  And I have always understood that kingships and princes is nothing more than the crypts and the bloods.
[00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:08.102]  People who have taken for themselves
[00:06:09.413 --> 00:06:13.042]  Uh, the idea that they are royalty.
[00:06:13.704 --> 00:06:16.091]  You've got to be out of your mind.
[00:06:16.892 --> 00:06:19.874]  Not to question who said that you are royal.
[00:06:20.414 --> 00:06:27.699]  I mean, in America, nobody likes to be around somebody who is pompous and arrogant and better than anybody else.
[00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:39.787]  Nobody likes to be around those people because everybody realizes those people live in a dream world who treat you and mistreat you and look down on you and snob you.
[00:06:40.708 --> 00:06:43.930]  People know that that's just a fake
[00:06:44.602 --> 00:06:45.143]  I don't
[00:06:59.259 --> 00:06:59.439]  I don't
[00:07:19.267 --> 00:07:35.477]  Vatican royalty, royalty all over Europe, is nothing but the crypts and the bloods, gangs, gangs who have murdered and killed and destroyed the freedom of peoples all over the earth, and today they are in power.
[00:07:35.557 --> 00:07:37.218]  They're ruthless, they're murderous,
[00:07:38.141 --> 00:07:44.864]  They are nothing more than gang wars, secret societies, criminal cults, criminal operations.
[00:07:44.924 --> 00:07:46.104]  Wow, you just made a point.
[00:07:46.184 --> 00:07:51.766]  Whenever I see the low-level Crips and Bloods and the Vatos, they're all calling themselves Latin Kings.
[00:07:52.166 --> 00:07:53.607]  Their symbols are little crowns.
[00:07:53.907 --> 00:07:55.888]  They have secret handshakes and signs.
[00:07:56.208 --> 00:07:57.648]  And that really is just it.
[00:07:58.248 --> 00:07:58.709]  That's it.
[00:07:58.869 --> 00:08:00.069]  That's the name of the tune.
[00:08:00.209 --> 00:08:04.871]  Royalty and holy people at the top, the priests and the holy ones of
[00:08:05.531 --> 00:08:19.562]  And all the different religions from the Billy Grahams to the papacy to all the silly nonsense that's on Christian television with all the preachers who are making 10-15 million dollars with their huge enormous churches.
[00:08:19.722 --> 00:08:23.044]  It's nothing more than a con job.
[00:08:23.505 --> 00:08:25.146]  It's a con job.
[00:08:25.826 --> 00:08:31.871]  And people are extraordinarily interested in being lied to, deceived,
[00:08:32.284 --> 00:08:38.969]  You know, even in the Bible, there's a story about Pontius Pilate bringing Jesus to the crowd with Barabbas.
[00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:45.373]  And on the one hand, he's got Barabbas, which everybody knows is a con artist and a murderer and a thief.
[00:08:45.953 --> 00:08:49.776]  And then on the other side is Jesus, who represents the truth and the light.
[00:08:50.496 --> 00:08:58.682]  And it's a metaphoric story where government says to the people, Pontius Pilate, head of government, says to the people,
[00:08:59.426 --> 00:09:05.630]  Here is Barabbas, a murdering, thieving scumbag.
[00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:08.572]  And here is Jesus, representing the truth and the light.
[00:09:09.052 --> 00:09:13.515]  And the scripture says, with one voice, the people cried out, Give us Barabbas!
[00:09:14.255 --> 00:09:24.742]  Which is translated symbolically to mean, when the people of this world are given an opportunity to know the truth, or to crawl on their knees before their masters,
[00:09:25.468 --> 00:09:29.147]  Who are nothing more than liars, murderers, bloodshedding thieves.
[00:09:29.975 --> 00:09:33.116]  People will always support the masters.
[00:09:33.396 --> 00:09:34.797]  They don't want the truth.
[00:09:34.897 --> 00:09:38.038]  That's what I was going to ask, is this morning, it's almost like a spirit.
[00:09:38.959 --> 00:09:40.219]  I got criticized yesterday.
[00:09:40.239 --> 00:09:44.681]  Somebody sent me a YouTube, a young guy saying, Alex used to say there was a new world order.
[00:09:44.821 --> 00:09:45.902]  I choose not to believe it.
[00:09:45.942 --> 00:09:46.822]  I don't want to believe it.
[00:09:47.262 --> 00:09:48.122]  It doesn't exist.
[00:09:48.323 --> 00:09:48.883]  I choose.
[00:09:49.423 --> 00:09:51.344]  I heard all these radio shows with callers.
[00:09:51.404 --> 00:09:56.186]  I'd flip channels and I'd come into work and it was other shows saying, I don't want to hear bad news anymore.
[00:09:57.065 --> 00:09:57.805]  They don't understand.
[00:09:58.166 --> 00:10:02.668]  If you face the bad news and deal with it, then you can have a good place to live in and have more liberty.
[00:10:02.708 --> 00:10:08.510]  But when you just deny and want to live in denial and want to lie to yourself, you have a horrible world.
[00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:09.331]  And it's true.
[00:10:09.711 --> 00:10:12.652]  A lot of people, they want to be lied to.
[00:10:12.672 --> 00:10:13.633]  They want to be conned.
[00:10:13.653 --> 00:10:16.394]  They think it's cute and funny, and I don't understand it.
[00:10:17.515 --> 00:10:20.056]  Well, I mean, you know, in a country that is
[00:10:20.866 --> 00:10:26.990]  Staggering in their economic woes and economic disabilities in this country.
[00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:35.935]  People are crawling on their knees, sleeping in their cars, and yet the alcohol industry, smoking industry, television,
[00:10:36.736 --> 00:10:40.520]  Uh, entertainment movies are making a bumper crop.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.961]  They're making billions.
[00:10:42.682 --> 00:10:42.982]  Why?
[00:10:43.063 --> 00:10:45.865]  Because the people have lost their souls.
[00:10:46.446 --> 00:10:48.168]  They have nothing to live for.
[00:10:48.248 --> 00:10:52.352]  And that was designed, that was a seduction because it's almost like a joke now.
[00:10:52.452 --> 00:10:56.676]  I talk to people on the street and it's like they're getting more retarded by the week.
[00:10:56.716 --> 00:10:57.457]  Without a doubt.
[00:10:57.837 --> 00:10:58.197]  Absolutely.
[00:10:58.257 --> 00:10:59.217]  What is going on?
[00:10:59.277 --> 00:11:03.079]  It's like a mass mutation is taking place before my eyes.
[00:11:03.739 --> 00:11:04.399]  Absolutely.
[00:11:04.419 --> 00:11:09.360]  I'm telling you, and it's frightening because I know what the future is going to be.
[00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:10.961]  I already know what's coming.
[00:11:11.761 --> 00:11:20.523]  There's going to be a time very soon when Americans, generally speaking, and the worst part about it is that the masses will never wake up.
[00:11:20.603 --> 00:11:21.644]  They will just become
[00:11:23.544 --> 00:11:25.345]  Acclimated to the system.
[00:11:25.365 --> 00:11:30.387]  Well I read government documents, I mean the new thing said you'll be arrested if you're seen hugging your child or kissing them.
[00:11:30.407 --> 00:11:30.667]  That's right.
[00:11:30.987 --> 00:11:42.192]  I mean so and the government says we'll be in gray uniforms with shaved heads basically lobotomized and that's who's even allowed to live and I see them phasing that in rather quickly the way it's going.
[00:11:42.572 --> 00:11:48.334]  That's exactly what I'm saying and so I'm frightened because I know what is coming on the earth.
[00:11:48.494 --> 00:11:49.595]  I know the kind of
[00:11:50.169 --> 00:12:16.318]  world which is coming and the people have no idea generally speaking the public doesn't know they don't care because they've been acclimated to it they have already learned how to crawl on their knees when they see uh... some holy most some holy man with uh... with a robo at that the black role they shaken fear uh... efforts of the black role for the priest a shaken fear so they've been acclimated and taught
[00:12:16.798 --> 00:12:20.859]  To be impressed with movie stars and wealthy people with big money.
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:26.201]  But it seems that the elite themselves have gotten more reckless and wild.
[00:12:26.661 --> 00:12:27.221]  Oh, of course.
[00:12:27.241 --> 00:12:33.103]  And the reason why is because they realize the entire human race is worthless.
[00:12:33.203 --> 00:12:37.684]  The entire human race is going to buy anything you put out there
[00:12:38.323 --> 00:12:43.126]  And now it's like the criminal element doesn't even know what to do with itself anymore.
[00:12:43.166 --> 00:12:43.967]  It's so easy.
[00:12:43.987 --> 00:12:48.209]  It's so easy to just fool the people because they love it.
[00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:50.451]  Well, that's... I mean, exactly.
[00:12:50.491 --> 00:12:59.457]  That's like the White House publicly says they're running Al-Qaeda and has them attacking Iran, and the media says Iran is Al-Qaeda when they're Shiites, the opposite group.
[00:13:00.097 --> 00:13:08.119]  And then, it's just all over the news, Republicans saying, we love terror attacks, they sure help us.
[00:13:09.319 --> 00:13:19.182]  I mean, how much more obvious, and then Gary Hart writes a letter, has it published in the newspaper, saying, our government stages attacks, Iran better do what they're told.
[00:13:19.242 --> 00:13:22.243]  I mean, they're basically, they may come out and say they did it soon.
[00:13:24.147 --> 00:13:24.827]  But you know what?
[00:13:25.007 --> 00:13:26.007]  Nobody's going to care.
[00:13:26.508 --> 00:13:30.588]  Couldn't care less, because it doesn't mean much to anybody anyway.
[00:13:32.949 --> 00:13:43.491]  Even on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno, when he does the jaywalks, when he walks down the street and talks to people and asks the average American, you know, who won the Second World War?
[00:13:43.591 --> 00:13:44.871]  They don't even know what you're talking about.
[00:13:44.891 --> 00:13:46.532]  They didn't know there was a Second World War.
[00:13:47.452 --> 00:13:52.613]  And of course, that thing we talked about before, about that young lady
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.660]  Miss Teen America.
[00:13:55.721 --> 00:13:56.981]  That was so appalling to me.
[00:13:57.081 --> 00:13:59.782]  I still wake up sweaty.
[00:13:59.842 --> 00:14:02.443]  But that's how, listen, that's how people are.
[00:14:02.463 --> 00:14:08.384]  If you know any history, they look at you like you're weird, and people kind of sit back in their chairs and act scared.
[00:14:09.405 --> 00:14:17.227]  I have friends, my personal friends, many years ago, that's what they used to say about me, that you're weird.
[00:14:17.687 --> 00:14:21.108]  You study, and one guy told me, he said, you're the only person I know
[00:14:22.061 --> 00:14:24.782]  Uh, in our circle of friends, that you don't fit.
[00:14:24.802 --> 00:14:27.264]  I mean, there's something about you that's just not right.
[00:14:27.964 --> 00:14:29.104]  And I said, in what way?
[00:14:29.124 --> 00:14:31.726]  Well, I mean, you read all those, all that crazy stuff.
[00:14:31.766 --> 00:14:32.626]  And I said, like what?
[00:14:32.706 --> 00:14:37.768]  Well, for instance, all those law books and all that stuff about religion and all that.
[00:14:37.908 --> 00:14:48.173]  And, uh, you know, the, what the bottom line is, is that he is so far removed from reality that anybody has a half a brain looks like a freak to him.
[00:14:48.833 --> 00:14:49.594]  I know what it is.
[00:14:49.834 --> 00:14:55.177]  If you are smart, intelligent, and inquisitive, you're not going to fit in this world.
[00:14:55.858 --> 00:14:57.399]  Stay there, stay there, Jordan Maxwell.
[00:14:57.419 --> 00:14:59.700]  We're going to keep talking.
[00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:04.463]  Jordan, we're going to skip this break, and then we're going to take the next one if you need a break.
[00:15:05.404 --> 00:15:11.108]  Jordan, continuing along those lines, timeline-wise,
[00:15:12.697 --> 00:15:15.219]  When do you think they're going to try to start their mass culling?
[00:15:15.239 --> 00:15:16.920]  I mean, we know cancer is way up.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.001]  We know they're injecting us.
[00:15:18.061 --> 00:15:18.702]  It's in the food.
[00:15:19.122 --> 00:15:25.707]  We know that, I mean, literally, I know a ton of people are 25, 30 years old, got cancer, people dying, little kids everywhere dying from it.
[00:15:26.207 --> 00:15:27.588]  You know, the brain damaging everywhere.
[00:15:27.608 --> 00:15:29.170]  I mean, we know they're carrying it out.
[00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:33.273]  But I mean, when is it really going to, I mean, how do you see things unfolding?
[00:15:33.773 --> 00:15:38.457]  Well, I think that it's like a train going downhill with the brakes off.
[00:15:39.943 --> 00:15:47.248]  They're scurrying to do anything and everything they can now, because it's like nothing succeeds like success.
[00:15:47.888 --> 00:15:58.016]  And so the more successful they become, the more arrogant and out of control they are, until now it's a feeding frenzy.
[00:15:58.236 --> 00:16:01.638]  Exactly, a mass looting, a sacking of humanity.
[00:16:01.919 --> 00:16:02.399]  Exactly.
[00:16:02.939 --> 00:16:04.000]  It's out of control.
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.663]  They've tried to bring in pure evil, and now it's just a bloody orgy.
[00:16:08.143 --> 00:16:09.104]  That's exactly right.
[00:16:09.244 --> 00:16:10.204]  That's what I see.
[00:16:10.364 --> 00:16:12.145]  And nothing succeeds like success.
[00:16:12.345 --> 00:16:13.406]  You see the same thing I see.
[00:16:14.127 --> 00:16:14.547]  Exactly.
[00:16:14.567 --> 00:16:18.569]  They're just frothing, destroying minds, poisoning everybody, poisoning themselves.
[00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:19.770]  That's the thing I notice.
[00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:24.072]  Even their high-level minions like Bill Clinton and stuff, they all don't care what happens.
[00:16:24.152 --> 00:16:29.255]  It's like O'Brien says to Winston in 1984, look, I'm falling apart, don't laugh at me.
[00:16:30.916 --> 00:16:35.159]  The fact that I'm falling apart to carry out this evil shows the vigor of the larger creature.
[00:16:35.819 --> 00:16:36.419]  Yeah, of course.
[00:16:38.131 --> 00:16:49.477]  I see it very, and it frightens me because I see the children on the streets, little ones in schools, thinking, my God, what kind of a world are we leaving our children?
[00:16:51.378 --> 00:16:59.322]  You know, and people say, well, I see a light at the end of the tunnel, and people are waking up, and I said, look, the only light at the end of the tunnel is a train coming.
[00:17:00.197 --> 00:17:08.421]  Because eventually, you're going to wake up and find out that the situation was far more serious than you even suspected.
[00:17:08.721 --> 00:17:17.144]  Well, that's the thing, is that people think I fearmonger exaggerate, and literally 99 times out of 100, it's many times worse than what I even thought.
[00:17:17.164 --> 00:17:18.305]  Absolutely.
[00:17:18.525 --> 00:17:19.465]  No doubt about it.
[00:17:19.605 --> 00:17:20.286]  No doubt about it.
[00:17:21.086 --> 00:17:25.568]  And that's what scares me, is that it's so much worse than what you're saying.
[00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:29.495]  And now the mentality frightens me.
[00:17:30.056 --> 00:17:33.401]  Yesterday I went to Disney Studios, for example.
[00:17:33.945 --> 00:17:35.006]  To deliver a letter.
[00:17:35.046 --> 00:17:46.095]  I got a letter from Disney for some piece of business and they said, please get this in the mail immediately or bring it over to us because we need this paperwork immediately.
[00:17:46.555 --> 00:17:55.662]  So I put it in an envelope and drove over to Disney and drove up to the security gate and said, would you please drop this in the mail for a certain party?
[00:17:55.942 --> 00:17:57.624]  And they said, oh no, no, no, no.
[00:17:57.884 --> 00:17:59.485]  We have to open it up and read it.
[00:17:59.565 --> 00:18:00.366]  We have to sit down
[00:18:00.846 --> 00:18:11.933]  And so the security guy has to open the letter and sit down and read my personal letter and read what's in it first before he can decide if he will let that piece of mail go through.
[00:18:11.953 --> 00:18:15.095]  Because he doesn't know because he's got a badge and he's in charge.
[00:18:15.115 --> 00:18:17.857]  Yeah, I mean, they're just habitualizing total tyranny.
[00:18:18.257 --> 00:18:18.677]  Everything.
[00:18:18.998 --> 00:18:19.418]  Purely.
[00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:26.072]  And I said, why do you have to read my personal mail and a personal contract that has nothing to do with you?
[00:18:26.633 --> 00:18:28.633]  It's addressed to Disney Company.
[00:18:29.114 --> 00:18:30.814]  It's addressed to a particular person.
[00:18:30.834 --> 00:18:32.375]  You don't have to open it and read it.
[00:18:32.535 --> 00:18:39.218]  I've noticed that's what happens in Nazi tyrannies and others, is finally even their own minions just are frothing themselves.
[00:18:39.598 --> 00:18:41.039]  I bet that isn't even a policy.
[00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:41.739]  No.
[00:18:41.999 --> 00:18:42.179]  No.
[00:18:42.339 --> 00:18:42.999]  It doesn't matter.
[00:18:43.019 --> 00:18:43.820]  It doesn't matter.
[00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:45.180]  He has a badge.
[00:18:46.081 --> 00:18:47.641]  And therefore he is in charge.
[00:18:48.121 --> 00:18:49.262]  Same thing at the airports.
[00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:53.452]  People at the airport and airport security have never had a job.
[00:18:53.532 --> 00:18:55.214]  I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what, let's talk about that.
[00:18:55.254 --> 00:18:57.155]  Here we go.
[00:18:57.215 --> 00:18:57.796]  Revolution.
[00:19:00.978 --> 00:19:02.719]  Yeah, they're gonna put in every major U.S.
[00:19:02.979 --> 00:19:08.764]  airport a system where you're totally naked, scans an image and saves it of your naked body.
[00:19:09.344 --> 00:19:12.667]  I told you that six years ago, now it's mainstream news and they tell you.
[00:19:14.088 --> 00:19:16.369]  Now they take blood without warrants at checkpoints.
[00:19:17.581 --> 00:19:18.722]  No doubt about it.
[00:19:18.742 --> 00:19:22.566]  I mean, anybody that's got more than 500 brain cells going all in the same direction knows that.
[00:19:22.626 --> 00:19:23.307]  It's just, it's outrageous.
[00:19:36.108 --> 00:19:36.389]  I don't know.
[00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:55.211]  We're good to go.
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:33.477]  First, before I can deliver the mail, I have to, at Disney, I have to open the mail, and I have to read the contract, and I've got to see exactly who wrote this contract, and who signed it, and what it's all about first.
[00:20:33.518 --> 00:20:35.520]  See, just no privacy, no nothing?
[00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:36.381]  None.
[00:20:36.441 --> 00:20:37.403]  Just total control?
[00:20:37.943 --> 00:20:38.284]  Total.
[00:20:39.079 --> 00:20:39.419]  I think so.
[00:20:55.586 --> 00:21:06.191]  So I have to open the mail and I have to sit down and take a few minutes and read this contract and see who it's going to and who signed it and before I can drop it in.
[00:21:06.411 --> 00:21:08.552]  And I said, why don't you just drop it in the mail?
[00:21:08.713 --> 00:21:09.013]  No, no.
[00:21:09.833 --> 00:21:12.374]  I have the badge and it's my job and I'm in charge.
[00:21:12.815 --> 00:21:16.516]  Well, it's the same kind of thing at the airport.
[00:21:16.917 --> 00:21:18.337]  That's why I don't fly anymore.
[00:21:19.298 --> 00:21:20.979]  That's why I do not fly anymore.
[00:21:21.019 --> 00:21:23.640]  Cause I don't want to have to take my pants off, my shoes off.
[00:21:24.444 --> 00:21:27.148]  And have everything... Why bother?
[00:21:27.408 --> 00:21:30.893]  But now it's going to be on the buses, trains, and the sides of the street.
[00:21:31.214 --> 00:21:31.874]  And they know!
[00:21:31.975 --> 00:21:33.296]  They know it's dog training.
[00:21:33.637 --> 00:21:34.879]  Training us how to be slaves.
[00:21:35.559 --> 00:21:36.120]  Well, that's it.
[00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:37.562]  I don't know what else to say.
[00:21:38.023 --> 00:21:39.345]  It's all right there in your face.
[00:21:39.485 --> 00:21:40.686]  Well, I mean, here's the deal.
[00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:57.968]  If the United States is run by the Knights Templars, or I guess you said it's inseparable, and then the Vatican wants to get rid of the borders, why does every city, and I have articles that came out in the news today and yesterday, mainline news, the police do not arrest illegals for drinking and driving, they do not arrest them for anything but felonies.
[00:21:58.849 --> 00:22:02.470]  Well, because it's a base, first of all, it's a very important base
[00:22:24.873 --> 00:22:28.594]  For, uh, for revolution in the North America.
[00:22:28.614 --> 00:22:40.957]  It's a very important operating base, like the Contras have bases in Central America, like the, uh, Medellin Cartel have their protected bases of operation for drug trafficking.
[00:22:40.997 --> 00:22:45.118]  Well, for tyranny and, uh, and drug trafficking,
[00:22:45.758 --> 00:22:47.019]  Underworld activities.
[00:22:47.079 --> 00:22:48.640]  Mexico is a hotbed.
[00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:53.864]  My God, anybody who's more than 10 years old has been to Mexico knows that.
[00:22:53.964 --> 00:23:02.389]  Mexico is a hotbed for secret societies, crime, criminal syndicates, drug trafficking.
[00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:11.936]  So you want to make sure that the borders are left open because the bottom line is that Europe has had enough of America freedom.
[00:23:12.771 --> 00:23:18.074]  I mean, that's so obvious to me, because I've been looking at it for so many years.
[00:23:18.834 --> 00:23:23.317]  It is obviously... And we're going to be destroyed by Hook or by Crook?
[00:23:23.977 --> 00:23:24.717]  Absolutely.
[00:23:25.078 --> 00:23:29.240]  Because, you know, that's the only thing Bush ever said that is 100% correct.
[00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:29.640]  He said that
[00:23:34.066 --> 00:23:36.307]  Our enemies hate us because of our freedom.
[00:23:36.928 --> 00:23:42.251]  The terrorists attacked us because they hate our freedom, and then you find out the terrorist is the black ops.
[00:23:42.571 --> 00:23:45.632]  And they did it to get our freedom, and the government's taken all our freedom.
[00:23:46.033 --> 00:23:51.295]  Well, but our enemies, the enemy of the American people, hate us because of our freedom.
[00:23:51.355 --> 00:24:01.461]  And I'm going to tell you something that is the bottom line at the end of the day, that is the only truth there is, is that the enemies of this great republic
[00:24:01.969 --> 00:24:13.811]  Hate this republic because they cannot have a new world order in which the entire human race crawls on its knees like animals to their masters of superior masters
[00:24:14.438 --> 00:24:26.525]  With a country that talks about individual freedom, liberty, and justice for all, you've got to destroy this nation, and who are the enemies?
[00:24:26.705 --> 00:24:32.048]  It's the Roman system of Europe that has been dominating the Earth for 2,300 years.
[00:24:34.589 --> 00:24:37.113]  ...of which America rose up against.
[00:24:37.473 --> 00:24:38.274]  Jordan, stay there.
[00:24:38.634 --> 00:24:39.115]  Gotta go to break.
[00:24:39.135 --> 00:24:40.377]  We're gonna talk behind the scenes, too.
[00:24:40.937 --> 00:24:43.761]  But, uh, very, very interesting, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:43.781 --> 00:24:44.362]  We'll be right back.
[00:24:48.561 --> 00:24:56.507]  Jordan, let's keep talking behind the scenes here, but we do have folks watching on PrisonPlanet.tv and listening on the web right now, and immortalized on the web.
[00:24:58.108 --> 00:25:02.191]  Jordan, and what a perfect plan to use the U.S.
[00:25:02.251 --> 00:25:15.380]  as the instrument to attack all these innocent countries, to carry out torture, to let the torture news come out, and then we get the blame, the United States gets the blame, and then we're totally replaced with the whole European Union system.
[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:16.740]  That's exactly right.
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:40.585]  If you go on my website, which we've been talking about, to questions, and we were talking about that on page one of questions, I show how the Vatican, from the air, and looking down on the Vatican, you can see the Union Jack flag right in the courtyard of the Vatican, and how the... Then if you scroll down, we're talking about dog tags.
[00:25:42.249 --> 00:25:44.810]  And why did the military have dog tags?
[00:25:44.890 --> 00:26:00.235]  Well, Henry Kissinger, in his book, Kiss the Boy's Goodbye, by Henry Kissinger, he said, quote, military men are just dumb, stupid animals to be used as pawns in foreign policy.
[00:26:00.835 --> 00:26:02.836]  Henry Kissinger says of the U.S.
[00:26:02.936 --> 00:26:08.318]  military, they're just dumb, stupid animals to be used as pawns.
[00:26:09.215 --> 00:26:14.999]  So that's what the elite think of the American military personnel, men and women in uniform.
[00:26:15.039 --> 00:26:20.503]  They're just a bunch of morons to send them out, and who the hell cares that they get killed?
[00:26:20.643 --> 00:26:22.385]  They were just a bunch of animals anyway.
[00:26:23.265 --> 00:26:33.833]  As a matter of fact, according to English law and the English language, a man and a woman, by the correct use of English language, man or woman,
[00:26:34.418 --> 00:26:36.279]  It's masculine or feminine.
[00:26:36.679 --> 00:26:41.562]  That's the correct way to talk about a man or woman.
[00:26:41.882 --> 00:26:43.423]  It's masculine or feminine.
[00:26:43.663 --> 00:26:50.826]  According to British English law, animal is referred to as male or female.
[00:26:51.807 --> 00:26:57.010]  And so consequently, on all of our ID, it says, are you male or female?
[00:26:58.467 --> 00:27:09.996]  You are not considered by law a man or woman, because man or woman, according to British Maritime Law, have certain rights and privileges that an animal don't have.
[00:27:10.196 --> 00:27:15.241]  And since we don't have that, we are male and female, not masculine, feminine.
[00:27:15.801 --> 00:27:16.582]  That's the law.
[00:27:16.702 --> 00:27:19.364]  Alright, we're going to go back live on the main show here in just a moment.
[00:27:19.404 --> 00:27:24.168]  JordanMaxwell.com, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:27:24.948 --> 00:27:25.789]  Here we go, Jordan.
[00:27:25.809 --> 00:27:26.830]  We'll be back in 30 seconds.
[00:27:29.463 --> 00:27:29.963]  That's right.
[00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:07.635]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:28:08.256 --> 00:28:11.278]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:18.024]  In the last month there have been more car bombings, more rocket attacks, more killings.
[00:28:18.124 --> 00:28:21.207]  Mexican troops in uniform came into Phoenix and killed people.
[00:28:22.892 --> 00:28:24.233]  How many miles over the border is that?
[00:28:25.674 --> 00:28:28.156]  And LAPD won't ask about immigrant status.
[00:28:28.237 --> 00:28:29.978]  Associated Press, I was mentioning that.
[00:28:30.578 --> 00:28:34.982]  I've got several articles like this in front of me today.
[00:28:35.062 --> 00:28:36.203]  That's out of the Associated Press.
[00:28:37.044 --> 00:28:47.233]  And my whole point is, is that the Spanish stations are all got names like the rebel, the race, it's all we're going to take over, we're going to get you, we're going to overthrow the U.S.
[00:28:48.257 --> 00:28:53.442]  And the government's saying, oh my gosh, give all your rights up, there's Al-Qaeda everywhere, and there's no real Al-Qaeda, it's Al-Cieda.
[00:28:54.263 --> 00:29:00.629]  But meanwhile, there is a real group with TV companies buying 700 billboards saying, L.A.
[00:29:00.689 --> 00:29:01.790]  belongs to Mexico.
[00:29:03.011 --> 00:29:08.756]  You've got people that are tourists to Mexico get shook down and robbed, the media covers that up.
[00:29:09.897 --> 00:29:11.798]  You've got the illegal aliens, and I've been told this.
[00:29:11.838 --> 00:29:14.559]  Cops called in yesterday and agreed, but I've had it happen right here in Austin.
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:17.741]  You can drunk drive, no insurance, no license, above the law.
[00:29:18.121 --> 00:29:21.823]  Citizens, the books are thrown at, and the police are told, do not arrest illegals.
[00:29:21.843 --> 00:29:24.644]  And it says right here, they can be under felony charges.
[00:29:25.605 --> 00:29:28.506]  And they do not bring up if they're illegal or legal or not.
[00:29:29.166 --> 00:29:30.047]  That is not an issue.
[00:29:30.107 --> 00:29:33.689]  So, for all intents and purposes, the borders are wide open.
[00:29:33.949 --> 00:29:36.490]  That fence they're putting up is to keep Americans in.
[00:29:39.451 --> 00:29:50.099]  You know, my whole point is, during the break you were talking about Henry Kissinger's own book, Kiss the Boys Goodbye, and it's a quote he admits, where he said the military are dumb animals to be used by us.
[00:29:51.380 --> 00:30:08.173]  The police are hated by the New World Order and used, the military are hated and used, they call them dumb animals, our future is being destroyed, and I guess, Jordan Maxwell, we the people and the establishment, the minions, I guess we're just going to assist in our own destruction, Jordan.
[00:30:09.108 --> 00:30:09.688]  I guess so.
[00:30:09.908 --> 00:30:13.049]  I guess it's part of who we are as a people.
[00:30:13.209 --> 00:30:21.412]  We have lost our souls, we have lost our minds, and we've lost our republic, and now we're just going to lose, period.
[00:30:21.572 --> 00:30:27.094]  And the reason why is because most people, I understand, it bothers me, but I understand why
[00:30:28.084 --> 00:30:28.765]  Do you?
[00:30:42.429 --> 00:30:51.753]  And it has to do with researching and studying the movements of the bankers, the history of the world, ancient history and how it impacts our modern day world.
[00:30:51.773 --> 00:30:54.074]  But why would people not want to know how the world really works?
[00:30:54.114 --> 00:30:56.255]  This is all incredible.
[00:30:56.315 --> 00:30:58.476]  It doesn't have anything to do with basketball.
[00:30:59.716 --> 00:31:01.477]  So what is the importance of it all?
[00:31:01.517 --> 00:31:06.939]  I mean, if it had something to do with hooters or football, it might be of importance.
[00:31:07.765 --> 00:31:10.506]  So most people don't give a damn about America.
[00:31:10.686 --> 00:31:13.788]  Well, they better care that their children are being implanted with cancer.
[00:31:14.328 --> 00:31:14.848]  Well, I know.
[00:31:16.189 --> 00:31:19.931]  Look at, like the Bible has Jesus saying, look, by their fruit you shall know them.
[00:31:20.669 --> 00:31:22.870]  We're supposedly a very Christian nation.
[00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:25.092]  We're a very holy and righteous nation.
[00:31:25.612 --> 00:31:27.573]  By their fruits, you shall know them.
[00:31:27.653 --> 00:31:30.635]  What is the fruitage of the American civilization today?
[00:31:30.655 --> 00:31:36.659]  50 million abortions, huge buckets of pus, just mental illness, total degeneracy.
[00:31:37.039 --> 00:31:38.420]  That's it.
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:43.223]  Throw in drive-by shootings, crimes, gang members, rapes.
[00:31:43.704 --> 00:31:44.504]  Incredible.
[00:31:44.624 --> 00:31:45.225]  And law?
[00:31:45.325 --> 00:31:46.265]  There is no law.
[00:31:46.365 --> 00:31:47.226]  Law is a mockery.
[00:31:48.601 --> 00:31:50.843]  That's by their fruit, you shall know them.
[00:31:51.624 --> 00:31:54.086]  I'm telling you, it's just an incredible story.
[00:31:54.126 --> 00:32:00.911]  And then here's a great quote by George Bush's mother, the President's mother.
[00:32:00.951 --> 00:32:02.072]  Her beautiful mind?
[00:32:02.152 --> 00:32:11.199]  Yeah, Barbara Bush said when she was asked about all the coffins coming back from the Middle East, all the young men who are dying there.
[00:32:11.219 --> 00:32:12.580]  That was Larry King Live, yeah.
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.982]  Larry King Live, she says, quote,
[00:32:15.563 --> 00:32:18.465]  This is Barbara Bush saying it about American troops.
[00:32:18.945 --> 00:32:22.307]  She said, why should we hear about body bags and death?
[00:32:23.147 --> 00:32:24.308]  It's not relevant.
[00:32:24.928 --> 00:32:28.170]  So why should I waste my beautiful mind on something like that?
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:34.982]  I was just amazed that the president's mother would say, who the hell cares about these chumps?
[00:32:35.042 --> 00:32:39.584]  And in that same newscast, exactly, in that same newscast she was kind of having a meltdown.
[00:32:39.984 --> 00:32:43.345]  She said, if you talk bad about my family, I will have you killed.
[00:32:43.806 --> 00:32:44.866]  Yeah, I loved it.
[00:32:45.306 --> 00:32:47.647]  So I mean, she's really telling us who they are.
[00:32:48.067 --> 00:32:57.151]  It's, you know, you're a bunch of scum troops, you're going to serve us and love us, I don't want to hear about your dead bodies, shut up maggot scum and help me bring down this country!
[00:32:57.791 --> 00:32:59.992]  And they even tell us, you are scum!
[00:33:00.213 --> 00:33:02.534]  Kissinger writes a book and says, I hate you filth!
[00:33:02.714 --> 00:33:04.395]  And they say, yes, yes, I love you.
[00:33:04.435 --> 00:33:05.096]  Call me filth.
[00:33:05.436 --> 00:33:06.637]  I want to attack more countries.
[00:33:07.317 --> 00:33:08.838]  Inject me full of deadly shots.
[00:33:08.938 --> 00:33:09.519]  Let me breathe.
[00:33:09.799 --> 00:33:10.399]  D-U.
[00:33:10.739 --> 00:33:11.580]  I love dying.
[00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:12.501]  Oh, it's so good.
[00:33:12.521 --> 00:33:17.404]  Yeah, and as I said, Henry Kissinger wrote a book called Kiss the Boy's Goodbye.
[00:33:17.424 --> 00:33:19.485]  You could buy it in any good book store.
[00:33:19.505 --> 00:33:26.990]  And he said, quite literally, in a quote, he says in his own book, military men are just dumb, stupid animals to be used
[00:33:27.435 --> 00:33:29.276]  As pawns in foreign policy.
[00:33:29.756 --> 00:33:30.176]  Period.
[00:33:30.676 --> 00:33:34.158]  They're just animals, so who the hell cares if they get killed?
[00:33:34.298 --> 00:33:35.598]  My God, who cares?
[00:33:35.678 --> 00:33:39.560]  And the sick thing is, you try to tell one of these average guys that, they will laugh right at you.
[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:41.160]  You know what, go read his book.
[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:42.021]  I didn't write the book.
[00:33:42.121 --> 00:33:43.982]  No, I know, but I mean, that's the incredible part.
[00:33:44.022 --> 00:33:51.484]  You go, your master says you're nothing, and that they're using you, and they'll just smile at you, and say, but I've got some pieces of brass on my chest.
[00:33:51.825 --> 00:33:52.625]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:33:52.765 --> 00:33:54.165]  Well, Napoleon talked about that.
[00:33:54.206 --> 00:33:55.026]  He said, man, people
[00:33:56.087 --> 00:33:59.629]  They'll step over each other to get killed if you just give them some pieces of metal.
[00:34:00.229 --> 00:34:00.529]  I know.
[00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:11.735]  And then of course, you know, the Leopold Stone, that's also on page one of my box on, let's see, what is it, on questions.
[00:34:12.296 --> 00:34:25.503]  On page one, research, on the bottom, the most holy of all relics in all of England, the most holiest relic in all of England is something called the Leopold Stone.
[00:34:27.712 --> 00:34:34.537]  It's treasured by the royalty as a very important symbol for royalty power in England.
[00:34:34.897 --> 00:34:35.918]  The Leopold Stone.
[00:34:36.018 --> 00:34:44.283]  Go on my website to questions and scroll down on the first page to the bottom and you will see the Leopold Stone.
[00:34:45.124 --> 00:34:46.805]  All it is is a phallic symbol.
[00:34:47.646 --> 00:34:49.127]  Have you seen it yourself yet?
[00:34:49.387 --> 00:34:50.168]  Yes, I've seen it.
[00:34:50.248 --> 00:34:50.708]  I've seen it.
[00:34:53.447 --> 00:34:58.191]  So, they put the stuff in your face, phallic symbols, mail-in elections.
[00:34:58.291 --> 00:35:03.034]  In fact, we'll put the, I saw it weeks ago, we'll put the layout of Bill Stone up on the screen.
[00:35:03.054 --> 00:35:04.015]  Which sub-page is that?
[00:35:04.796 --> 00:35:12.702]  It's on page one of questions, on the research box called questions, page one at the bottom.
[00:35:12.722 --> 00:35:15.764]  Okay, so you click research, and then you click on the one that says questions.
[00:35:16.264 --> 00:35:16.464]  Right.
[00:35:17.425 --> 00:35:19.647]  And then you scroll to the bottom of page one.
[00:35:20.549 --> 00:35:24.931]  And you will see the most holy relic in all of England.
[00:35:25.731 --> 00:35:27.232]  It's called the Leopold Stone.
[00:35:27.432 --> 00:35:28.412]  There it is, sitting there.
[00:35:28.492 --> 00:35:29.073]  I'm on research.
[00:35:29.153 --> 00:35:32.394]  I see words to search, pictures, quotes.
[00:35:32.514 --> 00:35:33.635]  No, go to questions.
[00:35:34.435 --> 00:35:35.756]  The box that says questions.
[00:35:35.796 --> 00:35:36.796]  Have you ever wondered?
[00:35:38.437 --> 00:35:39.797]  I think it's called, have you ever wondered?
[00:35:39.837 --> 00:35:40.398]  Yeah, yeah, there it is.
[00:35:40.438 --> 00:35:41.078]  Have you ever wondered?
[00:35:41.438 --> 00:35:42.338]  Go to page one.
[00:35:44.019 --> 00:35:44.939]  Have you ever wondered?
[00:35:44.959 --> 00:35:48.281]  Then scroll down to the bottom of the page, number four.
[00:35:49.531 --> 00:35:51.272]  And you will see the Leopold Stone.
[00:35:51.492 --> 00:35:59.076]  And then beneath it, of course, is a footnote that you can go on the web and study the subject of the Leopold Stone for yourself.
[00:36:00.537 --> 00:36:01.397]  Do you see it yet?
[00:36:01.517 --> 00:36:02.217]  Yes, I'm on there.
[00:36:03.758 --> 00:36:07.420]  So, that's the most holy relic of British royalty.
[00:36:08.621 --> 00:36:10.682]  And so, I don't know what that tells you.
[00:36:11.122 --> 00:36:12.883]  Tell folks what the dog tags mean.
[00:36:13.922 --> 00:36:24.507]  Yeah, the dog tag, that's what military people and people in law enforcement have an identification thing on a chain around their neck and it's called a dog tag.
[00:36:25.428 --> 00:36:29.510]  And the reason why is because that's exactly what the military is conceived to be.
[00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:31.171]  A bunch of dogs.
[00:36:31.591 --> 00:36:33.292]  I mean, that's what Henry Kissinger said.
[00:36:33.312 --> 00:36:37.654]  I don't know, it's just outrageous to me.
[00:36:38.295 --> 00:36:40.135]  All you gotta do is just read a book.
[00:36:40.155 --> 00:36:43.017]  Just go to the library and get a book on any of these subjects.
[00:36:43.633 --> 00:36:45.535]  And like I said, just go on my website.
[00:36:45.575 --> 00:36:47.336]  I've already done all the research for you.
[00:36:47.396 --> 00:36:50.880]  Just go on my website and go to Research Boxes.
[00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:54.303]  And there's all kinds of boxes there on all kinds of subjects.
[00:36:55.083 --> 00:36:59.167]  And go through my website because there's a lot of material on the links.
[00:37:00.228 --> 00:37:04.472]  And I do it even, there's just so much on my website.
[00:37:05.297 --> 00:37:09.799]  Well, let's go through words of this research, and just spend a minute or so on each one.
[00:37:10.119 --> 00:37:11.079]  The Black Hand.
[00:37:11.119 --> 00:37:12.299]  Tell folks about the Black Hand.
[00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:15.801]  Well, that was a precursor to what we today call Mafia.
[00:37:16.841 --> 00:37:17.701]  La Cosa Nostra.
[00:37:18.081 --> 00:37:25.124]  A long time ago in the Middle Ages, what we call today Mafia, La Cosa Nostra, was called Black Hand.
[00:37:25.984 --> 00:37:31.406]  Black, of course, being the planet Saturn, so it was a Saturnian secret society.
[00:37:31.626 --> 00:37:34.527]  The Black Hand later become known as La Cosa Nostra.
[00:37:35.574 --> 00:37:39.597]  It was connected to the Masonic Orders.
[00:37:39.818 --> 00:37:44.661]  And of course, Hoover said it didn't exist, kind of like the North American Union doesn't exist.
[00:37:45.422 --> 00:37:47.043]  I mean, this incredible denial.
[00:37:47.623 --> 00:37:53.608]  How do you deal with the denial when all of this is going on around people and they just say it doesn't exist?
[00:37:54.328 --> 00:37:54.629]  I know.
[00:37:54.809 --> 00:37:55.669]  And so what can you do?
[00:37:55.729 --> 00:37:56.590]  I mean, what can you say?
[00:37:57.391 --> 00:37:59.192]  All I know is I just put it out there.
[00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:03.851]  And people, like I said, ask me questions that are right here on my website.
[00:38:03.911 --> 00:38:05.652]  No, I know, but we're doing this live on the radio.
[00:38:06.172 --> 00:38:07.552]  British East India Company.
[00:38:07.572 --> 00:38:10.013]  I mean, I know all about them, but tell folks why that's so important.
[00:38:10.033 --> 00:38:12.794]  This is the modern model of the corporate fascism.
[00:38:13.294 --> 00:38:13.774]  That's right.
[00:38:13.834 --> 00:38:16.755]  That's where the United States is a corporation.
[00:38:16.775 --> 00:38:23.898]  There's a world of difference between the United States of America up until 1868, and after 1868, we have a new operation called United States.
[00:38:28.815 --> 00:38:31.776]  It's not a republic anymore, it's called a public policy.
[00:38:32.556 --> 00:38:52.502]  You know, even the Supreme Court, the head of the Supreme Court, I've got a quote on my website, or I'm going to put it on if I don't have it, where the head of the Supreme Court said that the Constitution of the United States was officially done away with in 1868, officially, by law, in 1868.
[00:38:53.662 --> 00:38:54.062]  Period.
[00:38:54.662 --> 00:38:56.723]  It has not been enforced, it has not been
[00:38:57.590 --> 00:39:02.794]  of any value in this country or in this operation of this republic at all, period.
[00:39:02.854 --> 00:39:11.119]  But now that they still kept some of the old conventions, now they're fully doing away with it, even in practice, chattel property.
[00:39:11.699 --> 00:39:15.682]  Yeah, chattel property, that's you.
[00:39:15.862 --> 00:39:19.044]  It's movable dirt, it's property, it's like a real estate.
[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:22.942]  And part of the real estate is you, because you live on the real estate.
[00:39:23.002 --> 00:39:28.726]  So they refer to humans as chattel property or movable dirt.
[00:39:29.366 --> 00:39:30.467]  Cognitive dissidence.
[00:39:31.027 --> 00:39:38.012]  Yeah, cognitive dissidence is what the whole country, this whole entire republic is filled with cognitive dissidence.
[00:39:38.132 --> 00:39:46.717]  Meaning, if you hear something that you've never heard before, or is in opposition to something you've always believed,
[00:39:47.222 --> 00:39:51.384]  Your mind cannot be wrapped around that information.
[00:39:51.444 --> 00:39:52.384]  You just don't want to hear it.
[00:39:52.985 --> 00:40:00.068]  You don't want to hear it because it doesn't have anything to do with what you believe, and you have your own truth, and so you don't want to look at the facts.
[00:40:00.348 --> 00:40:01.709]  You can't even deal with it.
[00:40:02.989 --> 00:40:11.333]  Like the fact that we told everybody there was mercury in there, and the government said there's no mercury in the shots, and now that they've had to admit, okay, it brand-damaged tens of millions, and it is in there.
[00:40:11.912 --> 00:40:12.452]  Yeah, I know.
[00:40:14.953 --> 00:40:25.378]  Like I said... But the slaves were told that it was not in there, so they will default to the old line and say, I don't care if the government admits it now, I love it.
[00:40:26.018 --> 00:40:28.199]  Yeah, I know.
[00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:31.521]  Another word in the box of words to research Congress.
[00:40:32.219 --> 00:40:33.760]  We talk about the Congress.
[00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:37.382]  People have no idea in the world what the word Congress really means.
[00:40:37.502 --> 00:40:38.302]  Tell them what it means.
[00:40:39.663 --> 00:40:42.764]  If you go to any good dictionary, Congress is sex.
[00:40:42.965 --> 00:40:48.027]  You know, I have two words, to caress and then Congress.
[00:40:48.087 --> 00:40:52.009]  And you have the upper and lower house with the goddess and the male phallus coming together.
[00:40:52.349 --> 00:40:52.910]  That's right.
[00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:59.713]  The Washington Monument is a male erection and it connects directly to the ovaries of the oval office.
[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:10.208]  And that's why you have the Congress, because you've got the male phallic Washington Monument connecting to the oval, or ovaries, or oval ovaries.
[00:41:10.228 --> 00:41:13.452]  Basically, we have a sun guy slash sex cult running things.
[00:41:14.192 --> 00:41:15.173]  Well, that's the bottom line.
[00:41:15.193 --> 00:41:16.234]  And they love killing people.
[00:41:17.071 --> 00:41:20.694]  I want to talk about the enjoyment of slaughtering.
[00:41:20.974 --> 00:41:24.096]  Like, you or I would feel bad murdering masses of people, especially children.
[00:41:24.556 --> 00:41:27.999]  They are very pious and say it's a very beautiful, loving thing.
[00:41:28.479 --> 00:41:31.481]  Well, I mean, that one general said it on my website.
[00:41:31.521 --> 00:41:33.382]  I've got that quote in the box of quotes.
[00:41:34.083 --> 00:41:42.889]  There's a picture of the general and testify where he said, one of the top generals in the Middle East said, for American generals, said, yeah, it's sometimes fun to kill people.
[00:41:43.809 --> 00:41:44.509]  We kind of like it.
[00:41:44.529 --> 00:41:46.050]  It's kind of fun shooting people.
[00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:47.331]  It's kind of like a game.
[00:41:48.331 --> 00:41:50.532]  See how many you can take down before lunch.
[00:41:50.812 --> 00:41:52.533]  You know, so it's kind of fun to kill people.
[00:41:52.553 --> 00:41:55.034]  But then if you were going after his family, you'd take it real serious.
[00:41:55.134 --> 00:41:57.855]  Oh no, that's different, because now you are a terrorist.
[00:41:59.076 --> 00:42:03.417]  I mean, I just don't know what to think about the whole world I live in anymore.
[00:42:03.458 --> 00:42:05.078]  Hey, what was the... I'm going crazy.
[00:42:05.158 --> 00:42:06.419]  What was the Inquisition?
[00:42:06.439 --> 00:42:07.799]  I mean, there were so many Inquisitions.
[00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:11.281]  Yeah, there were so many, but basically the Pope today
[00:42:12.377 --> 00:42:22.165]  Ratzinger was the head, before he became Pope, was the head of that organization in the Vatican that was, we call, the Inquisition.
[00:42:22.265 --> 00:42:25.648]  Yeah, that upkeeps, quote, the doctrine, that keeps the continuity of the Church together.
[00:42:26.088 --> 00:42:35.295]  Yes, and what it was during the Middle Ages, we call it the Dark Ages, because the human race was going through things which were very dark, and that's why we call it
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:40.944]  That time as the Dark Ages because we were in the really going through some dark stuff.
[00:42:40.964 --> 00:42:43.786]  Now why were they trying to suppress all scientific knowledge?
[00:42:43.806 --> 00:42:45.827]  We knew they'd hoarded it all and knew the truth.
[00:42:46.247 --> 00:42:46.948]  Why did they want it?
[00:42:47.028 --> 00:43:01.237]  And now they want to, the Club of Rome, the Bilderberg, they say again, they want 10% of us to be living, basically living on farms, everybody else exterminated, and then they'll be in high-tech citadels, bases separately from us.
[00:43:01.798 --> 00:43:03.759]  Well I know, but that's exactly right.
[00:43:03.819 --> 00:43:04.860]  But the Inquisition
[00:43:05.421 --> 00:43:28.199]  It was an extraordinarily important time in human history in Europe when anyone who would even act like you're going to, that you are for liberty and justice and freedom, freedom of thought, freedom of religion, freedom to think, you were hunted down by the Vatican, brought in, and we know the stuff that went on.
[00:43:28.239 --> 00:43:31.782]  The Vatican priests would pour hot lead into children's faces
[00:43:32.449 --> 00:43:36.672]  In front of the parents, they would open your mouth, the children's mouth, and pour hot lead.
[00:43:36.732 --> 00:43:38.254]  Now we see that being repeated.
[00:43:38.314 --> 00:43:54.286]  Now, psychologically, they know when they do the White House memos, ordering the Joint Chiefs of Staff to tell them to torture children with pliers, rip their genitals off, and then the public hears that and accepts it, and says, oh yeah, that's Jack Bauer.
[00:43:54.546 --> 00:43:56.367]  That's a great journey of evil, isn't it?
[00:43:56.648 --> 00:44:01.932]  If they can get us to accept the most evil thing, torturing children sexually, then they've got us, don't they, Jordan?
[00:44:03.053 --> 00:44:04.414]  They've got the whole human race.
[00:44:04.714 --> 00:44:06.195]  They've got the entire human race.
[00:44:06.555 --> 00:44:08.257]  Go to any good law book.
[00:44:08.297 --> 00:44:12.300]  Here's one on the words to research.
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:13.841]  Look up the word human being.
[00:44:13.861 --> 00:44:21.967]  A human being, according to this particular law book, says a human being is an animal, a monster.
[00:44:22.468 --> 00:44:23.929]  Then you look up the word monster.
[00:44:24.522 --> 00:44:30.484]  And it will tell you a monster is a human being and has no rights to anything, it's just an animal.
[00:44:30.604 --> 00:44:33.985]  So it's all a big joke to them, that they've changed all the terms, you don't know what it means.
[00:44:34.485 --> 00:44:36.505]  Office of Controlled Conflict Operations.
[00:44:36.765 --> 00:44:53.210]  Yeah, and when you read Mein Kampf, Adolf Hitler's book, Mein Kampf, we've known for, I mean, I grew up as a kid knowing, I had the New York Times, my dad showed it to me many years ago, and the New York Times had a huge article
[00:44:53.803 --> 00:44:56.745]  about Mein Kampf was written by a Jesuit priest.
[00:44:57.465 --> 00:45:03.108]  It was written by a Father Stemple, S-T-A-E-M-P-F-L-E.
[00:45:03.668 --> 00:45:11.752]  Go on my website and look up Father Stemple, and it will tell you all of the information there about who actually wrote Mein Kampf.
[00:45:11.812 --> 00:45:17.315]  It was a Jesuit priest at the Vatican who wrote Mein Kampf for Adolf Hitler.
[00:45:18.535 --> 00:45:20.016]  And so, you know,
[00:45:20.879 --> 00:45:24.045]  I just am amazed at how much people don't read.
[00:45:24.526 --> 00:45:26.249]  That's what my website is all about.
[00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:32.100]  Just go on my website and wander through all of the boxes, all of the links.
[00:45:33.172 --> 00:45:35.794]  All of the, uh, esoteric research boxes.
[00:45:35.894 --> 00:45:37.255]  A lot of stuff there.
[00:45:37.275 --> 00:45:39.177]  Okay, Jordan, we are going to take calls.
[00:45:39.197 --> 00:45:43.060]  We're not going to, because I want to just spend every minute covering issues with you here.
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:45.001]  People want Jordan Maxwell on the show.
[00:45:45.041 --> 00:45:46.382]  You've got him twice in one week.
[00:45:46.422 --> 00:45:47.123]  We appreciate him.
[00:45:47.523 --> 00:45:48.644]  JordanMaxwell.com.
[00:45:48.664 --> 00:45:51.526]  We'll talk behind the scenes from PrisonPlanet.tv viewers right now.
[00:45:51.546 --> 00:45:52.647]  Everybody else will be right back.
[00:45:57.375 --> 00:46:04.938]  Hey, Jordan, most of these terms I know about, but I remember reading a little bit about Office of Controlled Conflict Operations.
[00:46:05.098 --> 00:46:06.059]  Can you tell me about that?
[00:46:06.679 --> 00:46:09.900]  Well, like you said, you know that.
[00:46:11.401 --> 00:46:22.645]  They already have departments in government that will start the trouble, the wars or whatever, then control it, and then bring in, like we know, the opposing party.
[00:46:24.761 --> 00:46:26.122]  They financed both sides.
[00:46:26.222 --> 00:46:31.164]  It's just, you know, there were television shows made years ago.
[00:46:32.445 --> 00:46:32.905]  What was it?
[00:46:33.105 --> 00:46:33.785]  Get Smart?
[00:46:34.466 --> 00:46:35.566]  Remember on Get Smart?
[00:46:35.746 --> 00:46:42.249]  They got a new movie out, Get Smart, but in the television series Get Smart, there were two sides.
[00:46:42.449 --> 00:46:46.371]  One side was called Chaos, and the other side was Control.
[00:46:46.991 --> 00:46:52.314]  And what do you think they're telling you in the comic series Chaos and Control?
[00:46:53.331 --> 00:46:57.313]  And consequently it was always both sides of being financed by the same people.
[00:46:57.954 --> 00:47:02.176]  The same people caused the chaos are also the ones who are bringing the new control.
[00:47:02.617 --> 00:47:05.218]  And that way they're always ready to roll out and be the saviors.
[00:47:05.659 --> 00:47:07.680]  You accept their control and things get worse.
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:08.480]  That's it.
[00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:11.142]  And then they got more to save you and then it gets worse.
[00:47:12.142 --> 00:47:17.065]  And worse and worse until one day you wake up and find out you've been had from day one.
[00:47:17.085 --> 00:47:24.589]  Well, I was just going to say that all the power, all the control they've got, all the money, they really hate happy, healthy families.
[00:47:24.609 --> 00:47:26.831]  They really hate people enjoying themselves.
[00:47:27.131 --> 00:47:32.294]  Misery loves company, and the elite really just like to hurt people.
[00:47:33.514 --> 00:47:39.498]  Can you talk about the mentality, or what makes the higher level initiates tick?
[00:47:40.239 --> 00:47:46.301]  Well, look at what the way the SS Gestapo worked in Nazi Germany.
[00:47:46.642 --> 00:47:55.405]  Watch the, you know, look at the way they, their pompous, arrogant attitude that all humans were nothing more to be used as animals.
[00:47:55.585 --> 00:47:59.607]  That is precisely the attitude today in America today.
[00:48:00.287 --> 00:48:14.834]  That the working class people are nothing more than just their kids can be raped, you can run them into the ground, jack up their gas prices, do anything you want to these people, because they're nothing but masses of ignorant human flesh.
[00:48:15.434 --> 00:48:16.935]  So just do anything you want.
[00:48:17.015 --> 00:48:23.898]  Take the good-luckin' ones and rape them, and take the children, sell them, do anything you please, because it really doesn't matter.
[00:48:23.938 --> 00:48:26.439]  The people aren't going to do anything.
[00:48:26.999 --> 00:48:28.220]  They didn't do anything with
[00:48:29.068 --> 00:48:36.551]  Ruby Ridge, they didn't do anything with, uh, what was it, the Branch Davidians?
[00:48:36.631 --> 00:48:36.991]  Waco, yeah.
[00:48:37.011 --> 00:48:38.812]  They didn't do anything at Waco.
[00:48:38.852 --> 00:48:39.772]  They didn't do anything.
[00:48:39.872 --> 00:48:42.373]  All of those were just to see if you would do something.
[00:48:42.933 --> 00:48:46.595]  Now they have finally figured out the American people ain't gonna do nothing.
[00:48:46.875 --> 00:48:47.255]  Period.
[00:48:47.715 --> 00:48:49.716]  They're gonna go along with whatever you tell them.
[00:48:50.356 --> 00:48:52.997]  So if you tell them to take off their pants at the airport, they'll do it.
[00:48:53.177 --> 00:48:54.558]  Whatever you tell them, they'll do.
[00:48:55.339 --> 00:48:58.360]  So as far as I'm concerned, I just look at the whole thing and I'm just amazed.
[00:48:58.620 --> 00:48:59.281]  Alright, here we go.
[00:48:59.321 --> 00:48:59.721]  Here we go.
[00:49:03.242 --> 00:49:10.566]  Everybody knows that the days are loaded.
[00:49:11.466 --> 00:49:15.328]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[00:49:16.128 --> 00:49:19.990]  Everybody knows the war is over.
[00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:24.172]  Everybody knows the good guy's lost.
[00:49:33.576 --> 00:49:37.858]  But now the elite don't even need us to tell their fields to run their machinery with robotics.
[00:49:38.458 --> 00:49:47.483]  As Bill Joy of Sun Microsystems wrote, he went to a meeting with 200 plus elitists and he was shocked to hear them talking about how we're all going to have to be killed.
[00:49:48.607 --> 00:49:56.092]  And the police officers out there, most of them will aid the system incrementally as the rest of us are euthanized, sterilized, given cancer, die.
[00:49:56.493 --> 00:49:59.134]  They will watch as their sons, daughters, mothers, brothers die.
[00:49:59.575 --> 00:50:03.758]  They themselves will die thanking their lord, thanking their government, thanking their master.
[00:50:04.018 --> 00:50:05.359]  That is the new order slave grid.
[00:50:06.239 --> 00:50:14.804]  At the highest levels of the New World Order, Jordan, I've heard it described as the Great White Brotherhood, the Council of Thirteen.
[00:50:15.444 --> 00:50:20.807]  We know there's less than a hundred really true initiates that have the full picture of their master plan.
[00:50:21.127 --> 00:50:26.790]  But as best you can tell, A, who are a few of the top initiates to the most secret elite group?
[00:50:27.070 --> 00:50:28.131]  What's the name of that group?
[00:50:28.751 --> 00:50:32.233]  And will they be able to carry out their plans?
[00:50:35.169 --> 00:50:35.429]  I don't know.
[00:50:57.242 --> 00:51:14.312]  The real movers and shakers who are making things happen, you will never know their names ever, you will never hear their names ever, and that all the people that you are hearing, like the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds and all those people, are not the real players.
[00:51:14.432 --> 00:51:22.377]  The real players are so much more powerful and so much more hidden, you will never know who they really are.
[00:51:23.077 --> 00:51:24.158]  They cannot afford to.
[00:51:24.611 --> 00:51:28.092]  To have their name or their face ever put out in public.
[00:51:28.212 --> 00:51:30.173]  So, I learned that a long time ago.
[00:51:30.193 --> 00:51:36.435]  Well, we know as far as dynasties go, I mean, you know, you've got the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, the British.
[00:51:37.296 --> 00:51:41.857]  You've got the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, certainly sit on large piles of the wealth.
[00:51:41.917 --> 00:51:42.918]  Of course, of course they do.
[00:51:42.938 --> 00:51:48.360]  But I mean, you're saying the true, you know, the true technocrats, though, that are really running the ship.
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:49.781]  Yeah.
[00:51:49.921 --> 00:51:52.043]  Our people, you will never know who they are.
[00:51:52.163 --> 00:51:53.544]  You will never see their names.
[00:51:53.644 --> 00:51:55.746]  You will never hear their names spoken, ever.
[00:51:56.586 --> 00:52:00.209]  And those are the people who are really running the planet behind the scenes.
[00:52:00.910 --> 00:52:03.692]  And like a classic example is the Vatican.
[00:52:03.752 --> 00:52:07.395]  But the Vatican isn't the bottom line on this subject.
[00:52:07.876 --> 00:52:10.178]  There are powers behind the Vatican.
[00:52:10.318 --> 00:52:13.480]  There are, just as there was behind the Caesars of Rome.
[00:52:14.021 --> 00:52:16.663]  Caesars of Rome saw themselves as gods.
[00:52:17.170 --> 00:52:20.535]  But in point of fact, they had masters of their own.
[00:52:21.636 --> 00:52:25.942]  Well, you've always got the inner councils and the orders and the bankers for it.
[00:52:26.823 --> 00:52:28.806]  What's the real power behind the Vatican from?
[00:52:29.287 --> 00:52:33.873]  Well, during the time of the Roman Empire, behind the Caesars,
[00:52:34.597 --> 00:52:41.041]  The raw child of the Rockefeller types behind the Caesar of Rome was called the Pissos family.
[00:52:41.141 --> 00:52:45.824]  P-I-C-O-E-P-I-C-O-S, Pissos family.
[00:52:45.844 --> 00:52:47.304]  So the black nobility of today?
[00:52:47.365 --> 00:52:49.766]  Yeah, the black nobility of the Pissos family.
[00:52:50.847 --> 00:52:54.889]  Uh, and the Peasos, the father was Arius Copernicus Peasos.
[00:52:55.350 --> 00:53:01.873]  They were the real manipulators of the Roman Empire, along with their family and dynasties.
[00:53:03.354 --> 00:53:08.316]  They were the wise men, the power behind the throne, pouring over the parchments in their citadels.
[00:53:08.616 --> 00:53:09.077]  That's it.
[00:53:09.417 --> 00:53:10.597]  That's exactly right.
[00:53:10.617 --> 00:53:14.399]  And today, that still is today in operation.
[00:53:14.559 --> 00:53:15.440]  Powerful people.
[00:53:16.013 --> 00:53:22.717]  Behind world governments are setting, reading their... Here's an example on, you know, so above, so below.
[00:53:23.237 --> 00:53:24.177]  Yep, exactly.
[00:53:24.357 --> 00:53:27.779]  Here's another quick example, final segment with Jordan Maxwell coming up here after a one minute break.
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:36.384]  There's a bank that owns a whole bunch of oil wells and gas wells all over Texas, and you never know, it's a tiny little bank and a little guy living in a trailer.
[00:53:36.684 --> 00:53:37.324]  We'll be right back.

[00:55:05.106 --> 00:55:07.227]  Well, final segment with Jordan Maxwell.
[00:55:07.267 --> 00:55:08.307]  JordanMaxwell.com.
[00:55:08.327 --> 00:55:11.227]  A lot of great books and videos available at his website.
[00:55:11.988 --> 00:55:14.728]  Really appreciate him spending the last two hours with us.
[00:55:17.729 --> 00:55:20.970]  Now, I was just talking to some family that was doing some business in East Texas.
[00:55:21.730 --> 00:55:27.011]  They were telling me about this bank locally that owns so much of the land, so much of the property, so many of the houses.
[00:55:27.971 --> 00:55:30.232]  And you find out the guy that owns this hundred-year-old bank
[00:55:32.048 --> 00:55:34.030]  Is in a little bitty house with a trailer behind it.
[00:55:34.871 --> 00:55:37.713]  And you never know, you know, the guy's got like two teeth in his head.
[00:55:38.134 --> 00:55:39.134]  There's lots of that.
[00:55:39.715 --> 00:55:41.136]  And so that's at the local level.
[00:55:41.497 --> 00:55:44.579]  Somebody worth, you know, half a billion dollars, conservatively.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.301]  You never even know they had any money.
[00:55:46.321 --> 00:55:48.122]  There are not any listings of wealthy people.
[00:55:48.623 --> 00:55:49.424]  And it's the same thing.
[00:55:49.444 --> 00:55:51.566]  You hear Bill Gates is the richest with 80 billion bucks.
[00:55:52.006 --> 00:55:52.887]  That's a joke, folks.
[00:55:52.907 --> 00:55:54.889]  You notice he gave most of his money for eugenics.
[00:55:55.349 --> 00:55:56.250]  So did Warren Buffett.
[00:55:57.010 --> 00:56:02.051]  Then it turns out IBM set up Microsoft as a front company to get past trust busting.
[00:56:02.931 --> 00:56:06.512]  You find out that it's set up for eugenics as a family trust.
[00:56:06.752 --> 00:56:08.993]  That's their religion, isn't it?
[00:56:09.273 --> 00:56:10.693]  It's killing us and hurting us.
[00:56:11.533 --> 00:56:12.914]  It's a predator's religion.
[00:56:12.974 --> 00:56:15.594]  They revel in hurting us, Jordan Maxwell.
[00:56:15.614 --> 00:56:16.094]  That's right.
[00:56:16.474 --> 00:56:19.555]  And to mutate the human race into a race of animals.
[00:56:20.037 --> 00:56:23.039]  Oh my God, we've watched that on television and movies.
[00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:33.828]  There have been tons of television shows and movies and books written about, you know, the New Order and Island of Lost Souls.
[00:56:34.068 --> 00:56:39.112]  Back in 1939, Charles Lawton made a movie called Island of Lost Souls, 1965.
[00:56:39.353 --> 00:56:43.256]  Yeah, that's on the island of Dr. Maru with the Genesis H.G.
[00:56:43.276 --> 00:56:43.536]  Wells.
[00:56:43.936 --> 00:56:46.538]  That's right, and that's precisely the point.
[00:56:47.379 --> 00:56:52.725]  We've been told about this stuff for years in movies and TV about the world that's coming.
[00:56:52.745 --> 00:56:54.407]  Well, it's about ultimate domination.
[00:56:54.447 --> 00:56:57.150]  The greatest control freak doesn't just want your money and control.
[00:56:57.450 --> 00:56:58.391]  They want to hurt you.
[00:56:58.431 --> 00:56:59.412]  They want to kill you.
[00:56:59.693 --> 00:57:04.098]  They want to turn you into a monkey creature and laugh at you because they want to be gods.
[00:57:04.178 --> 00:57:05.879]  I was in a hotel in London.
[00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:14.501]  And these people that were looking at us disdainfully, oh you're Alex Jones, and they're like, we're royal and we vacation all year and you're scum.
[00:57:14.901 --> 00:57:18.142]  And whether they were or not, the point is, they wanted me to know that.
[00:57:18.182 --> 00:57:20.202]  They're miserable, unhappy cancers.
[00:57:20.983 --> 00:57:21.363]  You're right.
[00:57:21.903 --> 00:57:22.623]  No doubt about it.
[00:57:23.843 --> 00:57:34.745]  I need to say this again, if anybody's really interested in the subject of occult and secret societies, there's a reference book on my home page that's filled with that.
[00:57:36.218 --> 00:57:52.225]  I don't know, 560 pages is a very thick book on all of the secret societies, occult orders of Europe, around the world, religious orders, the different cults of theology, secret societies, criminal societies.
[00:57:52.345 --> 00:58:02.229]  It's just generally an incredibly well-written book called Occultiocracy, The World of the Occult Secret Societies.
[00:58:02.942 --> 00:58:10.484]  And the most impressive book I ever have read on theology and religion was called Symbols, Sex, and the Stars.
[00:58:11.384 --> 00:58:17.486]  And it is a very well-written book just explaining theology.
[00:58:17.966 --> 00:58:21.867]  And then again, that term, the stars, the movie stars.
[00:58:22.327 --> 00:58:23.987]  Of course!
[00:58:24.287 --> 00:58:26.128]  Absolutely, and that's where we get it from.
[00:58:26.969 --> 00:58:33.274]  And of course the other book I have on my home page is Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy.
[00:58:34.134 --> 00:58:35.555]  Incredibly important.
[00:58:37.297 --> 00:58:52.428]  Explaining how the astrological symbols and terms that are used in secret societies have to have a book called Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy.
[00:58:52.448 --> 00:58:53.769]  It's right there on my home page.
[00:58:54.490 --> 00:58:56.251]  And of course there's a downloadable
[00:58:56.827 --> 00:58:57.688]  I don't think so.
[00:59:05.676 --> 00:59:23.491]  Well, Jordan, I just want to say in closing, thank you so much for spending time with us again, and coming up not this Sunday, but the Sunday after next, we've got you on the Sunday Show, and I'm glad you've been spending so much time with us, and we'll go through some more of these terms and hopefully get people to just to think about looking behind the curtain and realize there is a curtain.
[00:59:24.331 --> 00:59:32.698]  We can argue about what's behind it all day, but the important thing is to get people thinking and to move forward, and I really appreciate you spending time with us, Jordan Maxwell.
[00:59:32.918 --> 00:59:35.220]  Well, I thank you for being my friend and letting me on.
[00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:36.601]  Thank you very much for everything.
[00:59:36.621 --> 00:59:36.921]  You bet.
[00:59:36.941 --> 00:59:38.042]  Thank you, Jordan Maxwell.
[00:59:38.503 --> 00:59:41.125]  Yeah, listeners a few months ago were like, is Jordan Maxwell on?
[00:59:41.165 --> 00:59:42.726]  Well, he agreed to come on.
[00:59:42.746 --> 00:59:45.288]  He said he wasn't doing interviews anymore and we twisted his arm into it.
[00:59:45.749 --> 00:59:46.710]  Two in one week.
[00:59:47.570 --> 00:59:53.415]  So there is Jordan Maxwell for you and back in about a week and a half again for everybody.
[00:59:54.376 --> 00:59:57.339]  State Rep Charles Key fighting the new world order straight ahead.
[00:59:59.091 --> 01:00:06.309]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final.
[01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:07.573]  Uh, no, he is still there.
[01:00:07.633 --> 01:00:07.994]  One second.
[01:00:08.891 --> 01:00:09.432]  For everything.
[01:00:09.492 --> 01:00:09.752]  You bet.
[01:00:09.792 --> 01:00:10.893]  Thank you, Jordan Maxwell.
[01:00:11.333 --> 01:00:13.976]  Yeah, listeners a few months ago were like, is Jordan Maxwell on?
[01:00:14.016 --> 01:00:15.577]  Well, he agreed to come on.
[01:00:15.597 --> 01:00:18.140]  He said he wasn't doing interviews anymore and we twisted his arm into it.
[01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:19.561]  Two in one week.
[01:00:20.422 --> 01:00:24.125]  So there is Jordan Maxwell for you and back in about a week and a half.
[01:00:24.746 --> 01:00:26.267]  Again, for everybody.
[01:00:27.228 --> 01:00:27.668]  State Rep.
[01:00:27.708 --> 01:00:30.191]  Charles Key fighting the New World Order straight ahead.
[01:00:31.881 --> 01:00:44.584]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:00:45.004 --> 01:00:51.385]  Loose Change Final Cut is rated for all your cleaning needs, from bathing, because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:00:54.446 --> 01:00:57.987]  Okay, we have State Representative Charles Key on with us.
[01:00:59.421 --> 01:01:09.151]  For the next 55 minutes, he valiantly has exposed the fact that there's a cover-up of what really happened to the Oklahoma City bombing.
[01:01:10.212 --> 01:01:19.782]  Since he first really pushed with grand jurors and others to expose that, it's come out that the Southern Poverty Law Center was involved in running the white supremacist compound.
[01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:22.941]  At Elohim City.
[01:01:23.241 --> 01:01:25.082]  They gotta get our guns one way or the other, don't they?
[01:01:25.122 --> 01:01:26.023]  These America haters.
[01:01:27.504 --> 01:01:32.748]  And it's also come out in sworn affidavits in major newspapers that McVeigh was a government operative.
[01:01:33.229 --> 01:01:34.029]  We already knew that.
[01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:37.772]  And the fact that the building was blown out, not in.
[01:01:38.673 --> 01:01:39.613]  It's just amazing.
[01:01:39.653 --> 01:01:41.254]  We cover that in my film, Road to Tyranny.
[01:01:41.795 --> 01:01:47.799]  And I want to spend some time at the end of the interview dealing with the new developments there with Representative Key.
[01:01:48.917 --> 01:01:51.478]  But about a week ago, we learned the good news.
[01:01:55.939 --> 01:02:08.403]  And that dovetails with other states like Arizona, one of the Dakotas, New Hampshire saying that if a new world order continues or gun confiscation begins or any of this happens, we're going to pull out, we're going to secede.
[01:02:08.443 --> 01:02:10.484]  Well, this story was from World Net Daily.
[01:02:11.024 --> 01:02:12.504]  It was also in some of the Oklahoma papers.
[01:02:12.584 --> 01:02:14.365]  Oklahoma defends, don't tread on me.
[01:02:14.945 --> 01:02:17.286]  State House defends its sovereignty from D.C.
[01:02:17.386 --> 01:02:17.926]  intrusion.
[01:02:18.908 --> 01:02:21.489]  This is what we need, a declaration that the Feds are out of control.
[01:02:21.509 --> 01:02:23.931]  I mean, they're federalizing everything with our tax money.
[01:02:24.211 --> 01:02:26.672]  They take our money and send a few cents of it back with controls.
[01:02:27.792 --> 01:02:33.415]  Steamed over a perceived increase in federal usurping of states' rights, Oklahoma House of Representatives told Washington, D.C.
[01:02:33.435 --> 01:02:34.035]  to back off.
[01:02:34.596 --> 01:02:37.017]  Joint Resolution 1089 passed by an overwhelming 92 to 3 margin.
[01:02:40.424 --> 01:02:43.026]  Reasserts Oklahoma's sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment to the U.S.
[01:02:43.066 --> 01:02:50.571]  Constitution, and according to the resolution's own language, is serving notice to the federal government to cease and desist certain mandates.
[01:02:50.651 --> 01:02:59.537]  The Tenth Amendment states, the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited to by the states, are reserved to the states, respectively, or to the people.
[01:03:00.629 --> 01:03:04.171]  Charles Key, the Republican State Representative who authored the Resolution to the World and Daily.
[01:03:04.511 --> 01:03:10.714]  They introduced it because he believes the federal government's overstepping its bounds has put our Constitution in the form of government in danger.
[01:03:11.294 --> 01:03:14.896]  And so he's the guy that got it passed 92 to 3.
[01:03:14.956 --> 01:03:15.917]  I'd like to know who those 3 are.
[01:03:17.137 --> 01:03:28.125]  And, you know, stuff happened with members of the legislature and with the local mayor, where they would say, oh, I don't know anything about a North American union, and then they'd catch them as signatories to it five years ago.
[01:03:28.205 --> 01:03:30.887]  So, a lot of that has got Oklahomans up in arms.
[01:03:30.927 --> 01:03:38.573]  I wish we had people in our legislature like Charles Key here in Texas, where they're really raping the daylights out of us, the feds are.
[01:03:39.433 --> 01:03:41.815]  But Charles Key, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[01:03:42.336 --> 01:03:43.837]  Hey, it's good to be with you again, Alex.
[01:03:45.044 --> 01:03:47.246]  You know, you've got the floor here for the next 50 minutes.
[01:03:47.286 --> 01:03:57.375]  Tell me about the Oklahoma City bombing website, this website, your site, what you're doing, but after you do that, let's get into this resolution and why it's a ray of hope.
[01:03:58.696 --> 01:04:05.822]  Well, you know this, and just for some of your listeners to know, I'm in my second tenure in the legislature.
[01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:09.245]  I had a previous life in the 80s and 90s in the legislature.
[01:04:10.086 --> 01:04:15.528]  And I was out for about eight years, and I didn't really plan on running again, but I did in 2006, and here I am.
[01:04:17.089 --> 01:04:20.550]  And the reason he had me on the show today, H.G.R.
[01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:24.731]  1089, which is the Tenth Amendment resolution, did pass the House this year.
[01:04:25.652 --> 01:04:26.832]  But it's not brand new.
[01:04:26.872 --> 01:04:31.234]  It's new to a lot of people, but it actually started back in the very early 90s.
[01:04:31.774 --> 01:04:34.515]  There was a state senator from Colorado named Charles Duke.
[01:04:35.411 --> 01:04:47.677]  And he started it, he gets credited with starting the Tenth Amendment Resolution, but he and myself back then and a number of other legislators and other state legislatures introduced it in their state legislatures and passed it back then.
[01:04:48.077 --> 01:04:50.258]  I passed it in the Oklahoma House back in 1994.
[01:04:50.659 --> 01:04:56.962]  Yeah, let's be clear, you guys passed that and said the UN's not coming in here, we're not putting up with land grabs, and boom!
[01:04:57.282 --> 01:04:59.543]  A little bombing happened to teach you to love the feds.
[01:05:00.757 --> 01:05:08.782]  Interesting times back then, and I'd love to take credit for it this time this year, but it does have a history that goes back into the 90s.
[01:05:09.322 --> 01:05:15.805]  But it's something we definitely, we must get out there and get every state to pass this same resolution.
[01:05:16.346 --> 01:05:23.270]  And I tell you, I've got a lot of legislators that are contacting me and saying they want to do the same thing in their legislature this next year.
[01:05:23.290 --> 01:05:25.531]  I've even got some people down there in Texas.
[01:05:27.685 --> 01:05:29.366]  Wow, now I didn't know that.
[01:05:29.666 --> 01:05:33.009]  I don't want to put you on the spot, but do you have in front of you who they are?
[01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:44.837]  I have their approval to talk about it on a public broadcast, so just out of deference to them, I think it would probably be better if I didn't mention their names, but I guarantee you there's some real interest in the Texas Legislature.
[01:05:44.877 --> 01:05:47.699]  Gotcha, we want to sneak up on them, that makes sense.
[01:05:47.739 --> 01:05:56.205]  Tell folks, I've got it here in front of me, but tell them where they can find the resolution to try to give it to their legislatures, and tell us what's in the resolution, why it's so important.
[01:05:56.687 --> 01:06:05.209]  Well, first of all, they could email me at charles.key at okhouse.gov and request a copy.
[01:06:05.229 --> 01:06:06.369]  I would be glad to send it to them.
[01:06:06.449 --> 01:06:19.331]  Or they can go to the Oklahoma House of Representatives website that's real easy to find and it's a very user-friendly website and just look up HJR1089 and you can download your own copy of it.
[01:06:22.032 --> 01:06:23.212]  Tell us about some of the
[01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:27.461]  Pun intended, key areas of the legislation.
[01:06:28.341 --> 01:06:30.742]  Well, you know, you pretty much described it in the opening.
[01:06:30.782 --> 01:06:39.785]  It just simply reiterates what the Tenth Amendment says and says federal government, get back into your proper role and stop getting into areas that you have no legal authority to be into.
[01:06:40.425 --> 01:06:43.607]  And my gosh, the list, you know, we don't have enough time in an hour.
[01:06:43.987 --> 01:06:49.829]  We'd have to spend all day long talking about what the federal government's done and venturing into areas they have no legal authority to be into.
[01:06:49.849 --> 01:06:53.030]  But go over some of the most egregious and why your state's upset.
[01:06:53.737 --> 01:07:09.546]  Well, you've got the violations of privacy, the Fourth Amendment, because of bills like the Patriot Act and all the other ones that we've already forgot the names of them, in which they've tried and they have, I like to say, tried to restrict our rights.
[01:07:09.606 --> 01:07:10.527]  Of course, they have.
[01:07:11.227 --> 01:07:17.211]  But I happen to be one that I don't believe in saying, well, they got us again.
[01:07:17.571 --> 01:07:19.212]  They've eliminated another amendment.
[01:07:20.349 --> 01:07:23.770]  I think the Supreme Law of the Land is just that.
[01:07:23.830 --> 01:07:25.031]  It's the Supreme Law of the Land.
[01:07:25.271 --> 01:07:25.651]  I agree.
[01:07:25.691 --> 01:07:26.311]  It's still there.
[01:07:26.351 --> 01:07:29.492]  Just because they're criminal doesn't mean I'm still not a free human being.
[01:07:29.833 --> 01:07:33.434]  Yeah, just because they passed some bill doesn't mean all of a sudden they superseded it or something.
[01:07:33.474 --> 01:07:34.174]  They got rid of it.
[01:07:34.914 --> 01:07:41.617]  But, you know, you've got privacy, you've got surveillance, you've got ventures into the area of education.
[01:07:42.099 --> 01:07:51.790]  You know, they're telling people what to do and how to educate their kids from Washington, D.C., tying funds to it to try to, you know... And all the problems started when the feds got involved.
[01:07:52.171 --> 01:07:53.132]  Yeah, it just gets worse.
[01:07:53.152 --> 01:07:53.813]  It doesn't get better.
[01:07:57.967 --> 01:08:03.792]  You know, they had a bill this last year that gave a lot of money to hire more law enforcement officers.
[01:08:04.313 --> 01:08:06.335]  They don't have any right to be doing that.
[01:08:06.355 --> 01:08:09.718]  It's not their role, their right to be in that particular area.
[01:08:09.758 --> 01:08:14.743]  Well, I hear people all the time on talk radio, even so-called conservatives, say, but it's free money!
[01:08:15.523 --> 01:08:15.864]  No!
[01:08:16.244 --> 01:08:22.810]  In fact, from what I've seen, federal money is the most, even if you agree with the programs, which we don't, I mean, it is the most wasteful.
[01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:23.631]  It's our money!
[01:08:25.390 --> 01:08:25.950]  Yeah, you know what?
[01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:39.315]  There was an idea that came up back in those early and middle 90s when some of us back then were looking at what we could do to thwart the activity of the federal government in unconstitutional areas.
[01:08:39.935 --> 01:08:49.979]  And this idea came up, if anybody's listening out there that might want to pass this on to a legislator or some of the legislators that are listening to this program or people running for office, you know, it is our money.
[01:08:51.235 --> 01:08:56.059]  And they're taking it and directing it back to the states with kind of a carrot-stick approach.
[01:08:57.099 --> 01:09:02.443]  You do this, we'll give you this money, then once you get hooked into the deal, then they'll take the money away unless you keep doing it and do more.
[01:09:03.004 --> 01:09:04.425]  Yeah, unfunded mandates.
[01:09:04.725 --> 01:09:18.495]  Yeah, what if the states said, okay, look, we're going to start requiring our people within the state to send certain federal taxes to us through the state treasury, and then we'll pass it on up to the federal government.
[01:09:19.321 --> 01:09:23.904]  And this is a real good money-generating, revenue-generating idea, by the way.
[01:09:24.424 --> 01:09:28.726]  The states would have some short-term interest they'd make on that money as it floated through.
[01:09:28.747 --> 01:09:31.168]  And that might really help some states out.
[01:09:31.708 --> 01:09:43.435]  But it would also allow the states to say to the federal government, when they start pushing more unfunded mandates and unconstitutional acts, to say, well, maybe we won't send that money back up to you, we'll just keep it.
[01:09:44.403 --> 01:09:46.844]  Maybe the states need to start doing something like that.
[01:09:47.705 --> 01:09:49.046]  Because it is our money.
[01:09:50.747 --> 01:09:51.847]  Well, it certainly is.
[01:09:52.848 --> 01:09:59.131]  What are some other areas that you think are important people know about dealing with the declaration?
[01:10:01.472 --> 01:10:11.538]  Well, you know, the big issues out there, well, the big issues that have been talked about for several years, I think it's gotten prominent again this time around because of the Ron Paul campaign.
[01:10:12.422 --> 01:10:22.286]  Is the money issue, the authority given to the Federal Reserve, private Federal Reserve Bank, to have control over just about every aspect of our lives having to do with finances and money.
[01:10:23.047 --> 01:10:26.788]  That is proving, and finally proving, to be a really big problem.
[01:10:27.409 --> 01:10:29.029]  They don't have the authority to do that.
[01:10:29.069 --> 01:10:30.150]  It's unconstitutional.
[01:10:31.250 --> 01:10:32.491]  And that needs to be addressed.
[01:10:32.591 --> 01:10:37.873]  Well, now they're saying the Federal Reserve's issued so much currency and liquidity that the dollar's going to be like toilet paper.
[01:10:38.534 --> 01:10:39.294]  Yeah, well, it's...
[01:10:40.239 --> 01:10:42.100]  You know, it seems to be heading that way.
[01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:43.900]  I mean, it's pretty bad right now.
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:59.705]  What amazes me and really makes me mad is a lot of these talking head pundits and people in both parties that make buckoos of money and have been living off the system for a long time, they don't have a clue how tough it is for the average middle and lower income person out here trying to get by.
[01:10:59.725 --> 01:11:05.827]  And they think everybody's still making a couple hundred thousand or more dollars a year and everything's real rosy.
[01:11:06.407 --> 01:11:07.948]  But the country is hurting right now.
[01:11:08.801 --> 01:11:12.222]  And it can get a lot worse than it might, but that needs to be fixed.
[01:11:12.322 --> 01:11:20.346]  And the answer is not to print more dollars up and throw a few coins back towards the folks with some type of a tax rebate or something.
[01:11:21.266 --> 01:11:22.626]  But that issue needs to be addressed.
[01:11:22.646 --> 01:11:25.167]  We've also got the problem of just taxation itself.
[01:11:25.788 --> 01:11:28.549]  The federal income tax is a bad tax.
[01:11:29.469 --> 01:11:31.350]  It's not a legal tax.
[01:11:32.130 --> 01:11:36.712]  The Supreme Court, once in our history at least, has ruled that it was not constitutional.
[01:11:37.694 --> 01:11:57.387]  If a court had the courage or the will, the constitutional knowledge, or whatever is holding them back from ruling on this issue, maybe they just need an opportunity, they ought to rule again that the federal income tax is unconstitutional.
[01:12:00.365 --> 01:12:14.414]  You know, it's just hard to believe that a state would have to pass a resolution saying the state of Oklahoma hereby claims sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States over all powers not otherwise enumerated and granted to the federal government by the Constitution of the United States.
[01:12:15.054 --> 01:12:23.920]  And you serve notice and demand of the federal government as our agent to cease and desist effective immediately mandates that are beyond the scope of these constitutionally delegated powers.
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:26.542]  Like federalizing local police
[01:12:27.262 --> 01:12:29.406]  I mean, folks, the government is out of control.
[01:12:29.446 --> 01:12:33.393]  The federal government, it's like a neighbor who's in your house telling you what to do.
[01:12:33.453 --> 01:12:35.036]  I mean, it is out of control.
[01:12:35.597 --> 01:12:36.759]  We'll be right back with State Rep.
[01:12:36.779 --> 01:12:37.901]  Charles Key, a great guy.
[01:12:37.921 --> 01:12:39.063]  We'll cover some other subjects as well.
[01:12:44.230 --> 01:12:48.713]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy?
[01:12:48.733 --> 01:12:49.034]  Let me talk.
[01:12:49.074 --> 01:12:59.421]  In demand of the federal government, as our agent, the cease and desist effective immediately mandates that are beyond the scope of these constitutionally delegated powers, like federalizing local police.
[01:13:00.121 --> 01:13:02.243]  I mean, folks, the government is out of control.
[01:13:02.283 --> 01:13:06.246]  The federal government, it's like a neighbor who's in your house telling you what to do.
[01:13:06.286 --> 01:13:07.887]  I mean, it is out of control.
[01:13:08.347 --> 01:13:09.588]  And we'll be right back with State Rep.
[01:13:09.608 --> 01:13:10.729]  Charles Key, a great guy.
[01:13:10.749 --> 01:13:11.930]  We'll cover some other subjects as well.
[01:13:16.994 --> 01:13:22.661]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[01:13:22.941 --> 01:13:27.727]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[01:13:27.747 --> 01:13:32.953]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[01:13:33.154 --> 01:13:36.598]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[01:13:37.078 --> 01:13:37.339]  I'm good.
[01:13:51.715 --> 01:13:52.035]  I think so.
[01:14:16.584 --> 01:14:17.565]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:14:17.645 --> 01:14:22.429]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:14:22.609 --> 01:14:30.416]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:14:30.676 --> 01:14:36.041]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:14:36.261 --> 01:14:43.227]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:14:43.507 --> 01:14:48.853]  A current effort is underway by the Fed, along with other central banks, to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:14:49.113 --> 01:14:53.839]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[01:14:54.199 --> 01:15:01.788]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:15:02.108 --> 01:15:08.355]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:15:08.675 --> 01:15:10.317]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:15:12.539 --> 01:15:13.119]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:15:13.139 --> 01:15:17.504]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[01:15:17.784 --> 01:15:21.248]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:15:21.408 --> 01:15:23.230]  But in liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:15:23.830 --> 01:15:26.571]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:15:26.871 --> 01:15:32.353]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:15:32.613 --> 01:15:36.574]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[01:16:51.152 --> 01:16:53.954]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:16:58.517 --> 01:16:58.977]  State Rep.
[01:16:59.017 --> 01:17:00.338]  Charles Key is our guest.
[01:17:00.618 --> 01:17:01.598]  Talk about courage.
[01:17:02.759 --> 01:17:10.924]  From day one when there was the questions coming out with the Oklahoma City bombing, which was an inside job from the beginning,
[01:17:11.966 --> 01:17:14.808]  He was there questioning, exposing, speaking out.
[01:17:15.549 --> 01:17:22.794]  And now in hindsight, talking 12 years later or more, it's just all coming out.
[01:17:23.674 --> 01:17:25.155]  It is all coming out in a big way.
[01:17:25.195 --> 01:17:31.020]  So I want to shift gears into that for the rest of the interview with our guest today and any other subjects he wants to talk about.
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:35.823]  But as a state rep, for all our listeners in Oklahoma, please support him.
[01:17:36.043 --> 01:17:38.705]  I mean, I know he was happy to be out of politics.
[01:17:38.765 --> 01:17:39.726]  Why did you get back in?
[01:17:41.058 --> 01:17:42.739]  Well, it was just kind of circumstantial.
[01:17:42.779 --> 01:17:51.205]  There were some people that asked me to run when the guy that was in there just chose not to run, somewhat at the last minute.
[01:17:53.466 --> 01:17:54.427]  That was just that simple.
[01:17:54.707 --> 01:18:03.113]  There was another guy running that some of them didn't think he was a conservative, and they said, we want a conservative in there, and we've got to have a conservative, and we want you to run.
[01:18:03.213 --> 01:18:05.835]  So I thought about it, prayed about it, and boom, did it.
[01:18:06.647 --> 01:18:08.488]  And they did the same thing they did to me before.
[01:18:08.508 --> 01:18:16.032]  They just blew me out of the water about the Oklahoma City bombing, but we prevailed and God gave us a victory, so that's just it.
[01:18:16.472 --> 01:18:21.675]  Yeah, they attack you when most Oklahomans I talk to know what's going on.
[01:18:22.436 --> 01:18:27.999]  Did that backfire on them that the story's gotten out now and that made your competitors look stupid?
[01:18:28.419 --> 01:18:29.199]  Yeah, I think it is.
[01:18:29.259 --> 01:18:36.081]  I think, you know, it's a lot like, this Oklahoma City bombing case is a lot like JFK and a lot of other cases that we can enumerate.
[01:18:36.121 --> 01:18:38.102]  You talk about it on your program many times.
[01:18:38.802 --> 01:18:40.882]  You know, as time goes by, more of the truth comes out.
[01:18:41.182 --> 01:18:42.043]  People have time.
[01:18:42.063 --> 01:18:44.643]  The emotional part of it, you know, subsides.
[01:18:44.683 --> 01:18:45.243]  It goes away.
[01:18:45.323 --> 01:18:49.745]  People have a chance to hear more, think more, and get more facts.
[01:18:49.905 --> 01:18:51.925]  And they realize that there was a cover-up.
[01:18:52.005 --> 01:18:54.866]  And that's what's happened in the Oklahoma City bombing case.
[01:18:56.157 --> 01:18:58.582]  I guess you probably had Jesse Trinidou on your program.
[01:18:58.862 --> 01:18:59.283]  Oh, yes.
[01:18:59.804 --> 01:19:03.931]  And that guy, talk about a bulldog and a courageous man.
[01:19:04.532 --> 01:19:07.758]  He has continued to keep this thing alive and he has helped
[01:19:08.729 --> 01:19:13.692]  Continue to verify what all of us were saying back in the beginning.
[01:19:13.712 --> 01:19:14.293]  Well, that's it.
[01:19:14.333 --> 01:19:18.595]  Ten, eleven years ago, everything you said has turned out, your angle on it has turned out to be right.
[01:19:19.016 --> 01:19:25.380]  In fact, break down the Jesse Trinidou case for those that may have forgotten, because that was probably six, eight months ago we were really talking about this.
[01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:28.001]  I mean, break down all the new things that have been confirmed.
[01:19:28.462 --> 01:19:34.446]  Well, it's been hard for me to keep on top of it like I did the bombing case when I was involved in that, but I can hit the highlights.
[01:19:35.086 --> 01:19:38.048]  Jesse Trinidou is an attorney up in the Salt Lake City area.
[01:19:38.584 --> 01:19:43.068]  He had a brother who died in Oklahoma City in August of 95.
[01:19:43.108 --> 01:19:44.269]  The bombing happened in April.
[01:19:45.010 --> 01:19:50.494]  And his brother died in a federal transfer center that happened to be in my district, by the way, right next to the airport.
[01:19:51.415 --> 01:19:59.642]  And when the family realized that he didn't commit suicide like the Bureau of Prisons claimed, so they filed a lawsuit.
[01:20:00.563 --> 01:20:02.505]  As time went by and they were able to force
[01:20:03.266 --> 01:20:09.490]  Documents out of the government, through the Freedom of Information Act, they found out that it was related to the Oklahoma City bombing somehow.
[01:20:10.531 --> 01:20:21.759]  What happened was some federal investigators, FBI and who knows who else, thought that he was a suspect in the Oklahoma City bombing case and they beat him to death, literally.
[01:20:21.779 --> 01:20:29.224]  And so the family filed suit, they eventually won that suit, and the Trinidad and the family have not let go.
[01:20:30.140 --> 01:20:34.701]  Become impassioned, not just... Let me just add, he also had electrical burns all over him.
[01:20:35.221 --> 01:20:35.521]  Yeah.
[01:20:35.581 --> 01:20:36.661]  Go ahead.
[01:20:36.861 --> 01:20:56.285]  And they're impassioned about this, not just because they wanted to bring justice to what really happened in regards to their brother and son's murder, but also because they found out how terribly screwed up this Oklahoma City bombing case was, and how the truth was really being covered up.
[01:20:56.809 --> 01:21:08.756]  So Jesse Trinidou, and you know, we should also give kudos to a federal judge up in the Salt Lake area, I think his last name is Kimball, has not let the Justice Department and the FBI off the hook easy.
[01:21:08.796 --> 01:21:12.618]  It made them have to live under the laws that the rest of us have to live under.
[01:21:12.638 --> 01:21:14.699]  And he said things like, this is a cover-up.
[01:21:14.739 --> 01:21:17.841]  I mean, it's amazing to actually have a good federal judge.
[01:21:18.501 --> 01:21:23.844]  Yeah, you know, even the Judge Mache that presided over McVeigh and Nichols' trials,
[01:21:24.784 --> 01:21:45.130]  Make a couple of comments like that back early on so there's no question about that it was a major cover-up and it was there were other people involved and they had a level at minimum a level of prior knowledge that something was going to happen and you know there were government informants inside the circle or these circles of individuals that were
[01:21:45.819 --> 01:21:48.461]  You know, going to carry this out, or they were participating in it.
[01:21:49.101 --> 01:21:50.542]  And, you know, the list just goes on.
[01:21:50.562 --> 01:21:57.466]  But how could you be criticized when you had grand jurors and people coming to you saying there's other bombers and I'm being told to shut up?
[01:21:57.826 --> 01:22:00.207]  I mean, that's your job as a state rep to speak out.
[01:22:02.028 --> 01:22:05.851]  Well, you know, there are folks that they want to go along.
[01:22:06.431 --> 01:22:11.294]  They're more interested in climbing up a ladder, whether it's politically or corporately or whatever.
[01:22:12.194 --> 01:22:13.355]  And that's what it gets down to.
[01:22:13.999 --> 01:22:14.379]  Stay there.
[01:22:14.399 --> 01:22:20.724]  I want to run through the basics of what you know about the Oklahoma City bombing and who you think is really behind it and involved.
[01:22:21.245 --> 01:22:27.890]  We've got a clearer picture today than we've ever had before, and we'll take calls on the resolution, throwing the feds out, re-declaring state liberty.
[01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:33.354]  1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to call in.

[01:22:38.198 --> 01:22:40.880]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:44.975 --> 01:22:46.156]  And that's what it gets down to.
[01:22:46.836 --> 01:22:47.196]  Stay there.
[01:22:47.216 --> 01:22:53.539]  I want to run through the basics of what you know about the Oklahoma City bombing and who you think is really behind it and involved.
[01:22:54.059 --> 01:23:01.663]  We've got a clearer picture today than we've ever had before, and we'll take calls on the resolution, throwing the feds out, re-declaring state liberty.
[01:23:01.683 --> 01:23:06.165]  1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to call in.
[01:23:07.026 --> 01:23:07.926]  We're on the march.
[01:23:08.406 --> 01:23:10.027]  The empire's on the run.
[01:23:10.947 --> 01:23:13.629]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:18.627 --> 01:23:23.928]  Are you tired of hearing that a cure for cancer is coming, but it will be available sometime in the future?

[01:24:16.809 --> 01:24:18.291]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Dimon.

[01:25:16.470 --> 01:25:17.891]  It is a big idea.
[01:25:17.911 --> 01:25:19.993]  A new world order.
[01:25:20.713 --> 01:25:24.956]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:25:25.589 --> 01:25:27.751]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:25:28.431 --> 01:25:30.653]  Put their objective be world domination.
[01:25:31.213 --> 01:25:33.655]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[01:25:34.395 --> 01:25:41.821]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:25:44.743 --> 01:25:46.084]  For the first time in history.
[01:26:09.965 --> 01:26:11.085]  Charles Key is our guest.
[01:26:11.145 --> 01:26:12.606]  I'm very thankful for his time today.
[01:26:12.687 --> 01:26:14.728]  Steve, Greg, John, Charles, many others.
[01:26:14.748 --> 01:26:18.210]  We're going to go to your calls here in a few minutes for State Rep Charles Key.
[01:26:19.892 --> 01:26:22.113]  When he's done in the Statehouse, we need to send him to Washington.
[01:26:22.133 --> 01:26:22.934]  We need some good people.
[01:26:24.437 --> 01:26:32.980]  In Washington, there's only Ron Paul and a few others up there, and Republicans and conservatives' names have been destroyed, thanks to Bush, tripling the size of government.
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.160]  Now we're looking at Barack Obama or McCain.
[01:26:36.901 --> 01:26:48.824]  Charles, before we get back into Oklahoma City and take calls, sometimes you've got to wonder, I mean, the elites are just running this country into the ground, and I'm just wondering if there's any hope the way things are going.
[01:26:48.844 --> 01:26:51.125]  There's hope.
[01:26:51.225 --> 01:26:54.026]  I think there's always hope, but I feel the same way.
[01:26:54.887 --> 01:27:11.497]  I get discouraged and down, but as long as we, you know, we have a certain amount of freedom, and we still do in this country, but back to the Tenth Amendment, you were talking about the Oklahoma City bombing and how they could attack somebody or criticize them for just asking questions and wanting some truth.
[01:27:12.037 --> 01:27:23.904]  Well, look at McCain, Feingold, and a lot of the other things they've done over the past few years to just try and control your ability to speak freely, like on this radio program, because there are those that don't want us to even talk about this.
[01:27:24.710 --> 01:27:25.591]  And that's what they do.
[01:27:25.851 --> 01:27:35.537]  One of the things they do is they will attack you publicly and call you all kinds of names, you know, and spin off the truth and tell a lot of untruths.
[01:27:35.797 --> 01:27:45.222]  And since the Oklahoma City bombing, just look at the legislation that's been passed to restrict what you can say and where you can say it.
[01:27:45.843 --> 01:27:48.384]  You know, there's what they call them, speech-free zones.
[01:27:48.905 --> 01:27:54.328]  If you get in some of those zones when there's a presidential motorcade or the president's there or some other,
[01:27:54.887 --> 01:27:58.769]  A political activity that they don't want any protesters to be around.
[01:27:58.810 --> 01:27:59.290]  What do they do?
[01:27:59.330 --> 01:28:00.931]  They'll haul you off and throw you in jail.
[01:28:01.071 --> 01:28:02.432]  Well look at Nancy Pelosi.
[01:28:02.492 --> 01:28:13.859]  The first thing they did after, and I'll just say it, after the Clintons bombed OKC, after the Feds did, the first thing they did was say, we need to bring back the Fairness Doctrine and reduce free speech on talk radio.
[01:28:13.879 --> 01:28:14.940]  They blamed talk radio.
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:17.661]  And now Pelosi says she wants to bring that back.
[01:28:18.522 --> 01:28:18.702]  Yeah.
[01:28:20.192 --> 01:28:42.204]  And I think, you know, I hear more and more people, what's been interesting in my experience coming back into the legislative, political realm this last couple of years, is when I went out and knocked doors in 06, running for this seat again, it was very, very surprising to me and encouraging, very encouraging, how many people going door to door, and these are Republicans, are the only doors I knocked,
[01:28:42.731 --> 01:28:44.934]  that are very aware of what's going on in this country.
[01:28:44.954 --> 01:28:46.376]  There's a great awakening going on.
[01:28:46.416 --> 01:28:47.958]  See, that's what I was going to ask you next.
[01:28:48.338 --> 01:28:56.209]  Whereas things are getting darkest before the dawn, I'm saying they're bad, I'm finding the same thing that people finally are knowing, they're finally listening.
[01:28:56.609 --> 01:28:57.571]  Go ahead and finish your story.
[01:28:57.611 --> 01:28:59.593]  Tell me what happened when you knocked on those doors.
[01:29:00.550 --> 01:29:12.618]  People are aware they're getting their information from someplace other than the nightly news and the newspaper, and they're starting to find out that they're getting lied to, and there's something really rotten in Denmark, so to speak.
[01:29:12.638 --> 01:29:14.759]  And they're waking up.
[01:29:14.799 --> 01:29:16.900]  A lot of this is pretty obvious stuff.
[01:29:18.261 --> 01:29:23.683]  The immigration problems like we have, and you've got a government that refuses to do something about it.
[01:29:24.323 --> 01:29:25.523]  Or so many of them.
[01:29:25.663 --> 01:29:31.965]  Oh, hey, I've got news articles where the police admit that an illegal can be drunk and they don't arrest them, but they arrest me!
[01:29:32.345 --> 01:29:34.606]  Now they should arrest me, but they won't arrest them!
[01:29:34.886 --> 01:29:36.487]  I mean, they're like super class!
[01:29:36.747 --> 01:29:38.507]  They arrest congressmen who are drunk!
[01:29:39.127 --> 01:29:44.029]  Well, you know, there's so many people, and this is a part of the answer to what happened in the Oklahoma City case.
[01:29:44.710 --> 01:29:47.793]  They came after me and other cases that other people have been involved in.
[01:29:48.253 --> 01:29:59.463]  There's always a section of people, and I talked about this on your program years ago, there's always a percentage of the people, when they hear things like a cover-up about Oklahoma City or anything else, they do not want to hear it.
[01:29:59.723 --> 01:30:04.707]  It puts so much fear into them, and their reaction is they want to kill the messenger.
[01:30:05.768 --> 01:30:11.493]  And they'll go along, they'll be cheerleaders and accomplices with those who attack the messenger.
[01:30:12.307 --> 01:30:17.801]  And that's how they accomplish what they accomplish, but even those people will wake up as time goes on.
[01:30:18.396 --> 01:30:29.838]  Because they'll come out of their denial because after a while they'll see, and this is what I think I'm seeing today, more people starting to wake up and realize, hey, there really is something to X, you know, or what he said.
[01:30:30.158 --> 01:30:36.479]  Well, I agree with you because what I run into is there's a certain amount of people who want to live in denial and say everything's fine no matter what's going on.
[01:30:36.759 --> 01:30:38.099]  They say, we're being negative.
[01:30:38.139 --> 01:30:38.479]  No, no, no.
[01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:41.800]  We're trying to protect what's good by admitting what's bad.
[01:30:42.300 --> 01:30:45.861]  You know, it's like if I have a fly in my soup, I don't say, oh, I'm not going to be negative and eat it.
[01:30:46.181 --> 01:30:47.081]  I take the fly out.
[01:30:48.396 --> 01:30:51.677]  Well, one of our investigators used this analogy, and I love it.
[01:30:51.697 --> 01:30:54.357]  I've used it a lot of times back when we were investigating the bombing.
[01:30:54.977 --> 01:31:02.939]  He was a retired officer in the Marine Corps, a good guy, and he said, you know, he said, Charles, I bet it's like, it's like a ship.
[01:31:02.979 --> 01:31:03.959]  He says, most people don't know this.
[01:31:03.979 --> 01:31:09.260]  When a ship starts taking on water in the ocean, you think it would just, you know, you know, go on over.
[01:31:09.580 --> 01:31:11.201]  But he said it actually gets to be about 17 degrees.
[01:31:12.648 --> 01:31:15.050]  That's what he said, I'm assuming it's true, or accurate.
[01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:18.652]  It gets to about 17 degrees and it just flops on over.
[01:31:19.312 --> 01:31:22.454]  And he said that's how this public opinion and things will happen some day.
[01:31:22.994 --> 01:31:27.037]  It'll just keep mounting and mounting until all of a sudden the people will wake up.
[01:31:27.157 --> 01:31:27.837]  No, I agree.
[01:31:28.058 --> 01:31:29.118]  And that's what they're afraid of.
[01:31:29.258 --> 01:31:30.359]  It's a flashpoint.
[01:31:30.559 --> 01:31:31.440]  It's a flashpoint.
[01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:33.421]  It happens in jumps.
[01:31:34.822 --> 01:31:41.826]  And those that we recognize that are our enemies, that are enemies of a constitutional form of government,
[01:31:42.492 --> 01:31:43.893]  They know that, and they're afraid of it.
[01:31:45.795 --> 01:31:47.277]  And we need to use that to our advantage.
[01:31:47.937 --> 01:31:48.258]  I agree.
[01:31:48.278 --> 01:31:49.018]  Well, I'll tell you this.
[01:31:49.099 --> 01:31:52.622]  Globalists just five years ago, six years ago, still were arrogant.
[01:31:52.682 --> 01:31:53.903]  I look at their body language now.
[01:31:53.943 --> 01:31:54.664]  I go to events.
[01:31:55.184 --> 01:32:05.635]  They look freaked out, but I don't think it's even freaked out about us as much as it is a lot of economists I talk to think they've lost control, that they have just totally screwed everything up.
[01:32:06.348 --> 01:32:18.477]  Yeah, that's another thing that wakes people up, unfortunately, because we've heard that all of our lives, because it's true that there's a lot of people that never will wake up until their back pocket, their pocketbook gets hit hard enough and the people are getting hit hard.
[01:32:19.238 --> 01:32:20.879]  So a lot of them are going to wake up for that reason.
[01:32:20.939 --> 01:32:21.700]  It's unfortunate.
[01:32:22.624 --> 01:32:24.807]  But if it works for us, that's fine.
[01:32:25.167 --> 01:32:27.049]  We need everything to our advantage that we can get.
[01:32:41.525 --> 01:32:42.786]  Hello there, Alex.
[01:32:42.806 --> 01:32:43.086]  Hi.
[01:32:43.106 --> 01:32:44.547]  Hello, Representative Key.
[01:32:45.348 --> 01:32:56.997]  I think one of the main reasons why people want to shoot the messenger so much is because they don't want to actually have to believe that their government is degraded into such a despicable situation.
[01:32:57.497 --> 01:33:02.241]  And then also another reason is because they might actually have to do something with the knowledge that they found out.
[01:33:03.162 --> 01:33:04.063]  Yeah, I agree with you.
[01:33:04.303 --> 01:33:08.126]  But then they might find out how bad it's going to be if they don't do something.
[01:33:08.206 --> 01:33:09.427]  Then they really would do something.
[01:33:10.366 --> 01:33:12.147]  Well, that's an interesting point, too.
[01:33:12.947 --> 01:33:26.893]  My questions were, I had heard the story, I guess, about helicopters taking some of the federal people off the roof of the Murrah Building.
[01:33:26.913 --> 01:33:29.914]  Do you know that to be true at all?
[01:33:30.774 --> 01:33:32.695]  I mean, prior to the blast?
[01:33:33.155 --> 01:33:34.756]  No, never found any truth to that.
[01:33:35.888 --> 01:33:39.130]  There were stories that were, you know, hearsay.
[01:33:39.190 --> 01:33:41.091]  I mean, you know, nothing we could ever really get into.
[01:33:41.131 --> 01:33:42.852]  Why wouldn't they just walk out the front?
[01:33:43.673 --> 01:33:45.674]  Well, because they didn't want to alarm anybody.
[01:33:45.714 --> 01:33:48.035]  From what I understand, they went out of rooftop exit.
[01:33:48.956 --> 01:33:50.717]  But a helicopter wouldn't alarm people?
[01:33:51.637 --> 01:33:53.358]  Well, that's just what I had heard.
[01:33:53.458 --> 01:33:56.820]  I didn't know for sure whether that was true.
[01:33:57.921 --> 01:33:59.562]  Yeah, we don't know that.
[01:33:59.582 --> 01:34:01.603]  I don't know if there's any way to prove that.
[01:34:01.663 --> 01:34:04.865]  We worked real hard at that and so many other clues.
[01:34:05.782 --> 01:34:06.903]  By the way, operative word, bombings.
[01:34:06.923 --> 01:34:07.323]  Thank you, Steve.
[01:34:07.343 --> 01:34:08.604]  We know there were multiple bombs.
[01:34:08.624 --> 01:34:09.845]  Can you explain how you can say that?
[01:34:28.021 --> 01:34:29.241]  Well, there's just too many experts.
[01:34:29.261 --> 01:34:35.983]  You know, this is a subject that is difficult for most people because they don't understand all this, and I was one of those.
[01:34:36.763 --> 01:34:41.464]  I learned a lot, learned a lot more than I ever would have, you know, if I hadn't been involved in the bombing.
[01:34:41.484 --> 01:34:45.305]  But you've got experts, people that have done this all their lives, like General Partin and many others.
[01:34:46.006 --> 01:34:51.627]  And we've got some of those in that report that we published that come out and analyze, and this is what they do for a living.
[01:34:51.647 --> 01:34:55.548]  They've done it all their lives in the military, in commercial application.
[01:34:56.507 --> 01:34:59.550]  They analyze terrorist bombs, bombings.
[01:34:59.610 --> 01:35:04.875]  They analyze tests that they do, like at Eglin Air Force Base that's been talked about a lot.
[01:35:05.415 --> 01:35:09.439]  And they know how these things work and what will and won't happen.
[01:35:09.459 --> 01:35:13.982]  And they can analyze a case like this and say, well, here's what happened.
[01:35:14.383 --> 01:35:18.426]  Here's how many bombs were used, and here's where they were placed, etc., etc.
[01:35:18.907 --> 01:35:23.771]  The experts have looked at it, analyzed it, and concluded that multiple bombs were used.
[01:35:31.104 --> 01:35:34.347]  Yes, go ahead and continue.
[01:35:48.996 --> 01:35:49.736]  Representative Key.
[01:35:50.637 --> 01:36:03.963]  Going back to the BATF, what we do know is they showed up in their bomb gear seconds after the blast, and we're telling EMTs and people that showed up to dress wounds and say that they'd seen them up in the higher floors.
[01:36:04.343 --> 01:36:05.684]  What do you think was behind that?
[01:36:07.004 --> 01:36:08.025]  Well, it's pretty interesting.
[01:36:08.065 --> 01:36:16.769]  You know, you had an AP reporter that's been around for a long time, and he gave that testimony on videotape.
[01:36:17.438 --> 01:36:32.521]  That he was immediately on the scene, and he said immediately these ATF officials showed up with the black gear, you know, all decked out in their black SWAT team type gear, like they were poised, ready for this to happen.
[01:36:33.141 --> 01:36:35.782]  And that's where that information comes from.
[01:36:36.042 --> 01:36:44.504]  Also, related to that is the Oklahoma City Fire Department getting some call the Friday before the Wednesday bombing about
[01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:51.544]  Uh, them being in a higher prepared state for something that may be developing over the next several days.
[01:36:51.624 --> 01:36:55.727]  And then didn't we also have the BATF out at a base testing, blowing up trucks?
[01:36:56.407 --> 01:37:00.470]  Yeah, out in New Mexico we're blowing up trucks with AMFO bombs.
[01:37:01.931 --> 01:37:04.513]  Very interesting also, to say the least.
[01:37:05.020 --> 01:37:21.165]  And this is in the months before, and of course you're not just saying the experts say multiple bombs, or how does a truck bomb not blow the pillars out right in front of the pillars the same size way back in the back of the building, and then why were chunks of it blown across the street, and why were there blast points on the rebar?
[01:37:21.445 --> 01:37:22.305]  I mean, all of that.
[01:37:22.765 --> 01:37:26.426]  You also have the governor coming on, who obviously wasn't involved because he was, you know,
[01:37:28.547 --> 01:37:29.548]  Or he wouldn't have been saying this.
[01:37:29.568 --> 01:37:32.829]  Yeah, we found multiple bombs, very sophisticated bombs inside.
[01:37:32.849 --> 01:37:36.251]  And then the BATF shows up and says, no, that's not what you saw.
[01:37:38.132 --> 01:37:38.392]  Yeah.
[01:37:38.752 --> 01:37:40.693]  And then you had another bomb expert.
[01:37:40.733 --> 01:37:54.719]  I mean, they've got a bunch of them, but you have another terrorism and bomb expert that was on one of the local stations that came in studio just, you know, a few hours after the bombing and was reporting also that, yeah, we've just found out that they found other unexploded bombs that they've taken out of the building.
[01:37:54.759 --> 01:37:56.080]  And this is really great because
[01:37:56.920 --> 01:38:03.323]  As they take these apart, it's going to help us find out who did it and be able to track them down, hold them accountable, blah, blah, blah.
[01:38:03.923 --> 01:38:06.104]  So, you know, just all kinds of information like that.
[01:38:06.584 --> 01:38:20.691]  I'll tell you, some of the stuff that Jesse Trinidad, the attorney we were talking about earlier, has been able to force out that further sheds light on this case is the information about Andreas, or otherwise known as Andy Strossmeier, the West German
[01:38:21.348 --> 01:38:22.389]  The Southern Poverty Law Center?
[01:38:45.379 --> 01:38:49.542]  Involved, I mean, it's just despicable activities, but they've got to get our guns one way or the other.
[01:38:50.543 --> 01:38:57.028]  Just amazing, and then the fact that McVeigh was a government operative coming out in affidavits, it's just incredible.
[01:38:57.749 --> 01:38:59.990]  Greg in New Jersey, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:39:00.871 --> 01:39:04.494]  Thank you very much, and thank you for putting me on.
[01:39:04.954 --> 01:39:14.742]  It's kind of ironic, here in Oklahoma, they're stating their rights to be left alone from the federal government, and here in New Jersey, which is no doubt our
[01:39:15.399 --> 01:39:18.669]  Our representative government in the state is the criminal syndicate.
[01:39:19.251 --> 01:39:20.495]  We actually have the U.S.
[01:39:20.555 --> 01:39:21.077]  Attorney.
[01:39:21.630 --> 01:39:24.171]  They're doing the work that New Jersey's attorneys should be doing.
[01:39:24.191 --> 01:39:29.214]  We have a thousand attorneys working for the state government in New Jersey, yet they have to use a federal U.S.
[01:39:29.314 --> 01:39:32.876]  attorney to prosecute the corrupt politicians that are here.
[01:39:32.936 --> 01:39:34.777]  So far, they've nailed, like, the mayor of Newark.
[01:39:34.797 --> 01:39:35.837]  Well, that's another problem.
[01:39:35.857 --> 01:39:38.038]  They'll never go after locals with the state.
[01:39:38.098 --> 01:39:41.700]  It's like it's supposedly the purview of the feds, who are even more corrupt.
[01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:44.822]  A very dangerous violation of states' rights.
[01:39:45.002 --> 01:39:45.382]  Mr. Key?
[01:39:45.402 --> 01:39:48.024]  Yeah, it's unfortunate.
[01:39:48.084 --> 01:39:50.565]  I had somebody on another program several days ago.
[01:39:51.686 --> 01:40:01.870]  Call me up and talk about civil rights laws and how the feds had to come in and prosecute people for racial types of crimes and what have you.
[01:40:02.370 --> 01:40:03.311]  So that's a tough issue.
[01:40:03.351 --> 01:40:11.794]  You get down the path, you buy into the federal government having a good role and the only one that can fix, make some wrongs right.
[01:40:12.669 --> 01:40:14.350]  And it kind of gets things all screwed up.
[01:40:14.831 --> 01:40:20.294]  Well they play that game in Europe where the nations, they won't let the people ever go to those courts, they've got to go to the EU court.
[01:40:21.255 --> 01:40:25.657]  And so it's handing your authority away when you have less control over the Feds.
[01:40:25.717 --> 01:40:26.318]  Anything else Greg?
[01:40:27.317 --> 01:40:33.002]  Well, my question was, do you think that's a good thing or a bad thing, where we have to actually ask the U.S.
[01:40:33.082 --> 01:40:34.102]  Attorney to get involved?
[01:40:34.142 --> 01:40:40.547]  Yeah, I think it's a bad thing, because the feds are even so much more corrupt, and they'll only selectively enforce on who they want.
[01:40:40.567 --> 01:40:43.490]  I mean, I think that really is a state matter.
[01:40:43.510 --> 01:40:46.172]  Well, the problem is always the people.
[01:40:47.448 --> 01:40:48.669]  Holding their government accountable.
[01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:50.050]  That's always the problem.
[01:40:50.591 --> 01:40:56.956]  Because you could fix these things at the state level if the people would watch their government and hold people accountable and make them fix it.
[01:40:57.416 --> 01:40:58.257]  Yeah, here's an example.
[01:40:58.557 --> 01:41:01.079]  Who do you go to with the Feds engaged in terrorism?
[01:41:01.539 --> 01:41:06.143]  I mean, they admit they staged the USS Liberty, they staged the Gulf of Tonkin, a bunch of other events.
[01:41:06.383 --> 01:41:08.625]  Who do we go to about our own government staging things?
[01:41:08.645 --> 01:41:13.449]  I mean, going to the Feds, you know, whoever's got more power almost always is going to be more corrupt.
[01:41:14.091 --> 01:41:23.177]  Yeah, the problem, and another way of stating that, too, is the problem is it assumes that somehow the federal government is more moral or ethical or something.
[01:41:23.537 --> 01:41:23.997]  And they're not.
[01:41:24.137 --> 01:41:33.143]  Just like Alex is saying, you know, they're just people, and they're corrupt, too, and they're going to use their power for things other than, you know, what's best for all of us.
[01:41:33.443 --> 01:41:34.624]  Yeah, let's take another call.
[01:41:34.664 --> 01:41:35.204]  Thanks, Greg.
[01:41:35.264 --> 01:41:36.685]  John in Fort Worth, Texas.
[01:41:36.705 --> 01:41:38.426]  You're on the air with Representative Keith.
[01:41:39.466 --> 01:41:40.807]  Hi, thank you for taking my call.
[01:41:41.007 --> 01:41:42.869]  I just wanted to ask the Representative,
[01:41:44.249 --> 01:41:59.422]  How did, after Oklahoma City, how did the, in general, the majority of people in Oklahoma, did they go along with the status that was given to them, or was there a lot of trepidation in what happened?
[01:42:00.803 --> 01:42:12.593]  Well, I think, and I've come to describe it this way, and I think I always probably will, the answer to that kind of question is that people were traumatized all over the country, but especially right here
[01:42:13.479 --> 01:42:22.503]  At ground, at the ground central or whatever I'm trying to say, right here where it happened, right here in Oklahoma City.
[01:42:22.963 --> 01:42:26.004]  I mean, people were just traumatized by this.
[01:42:27.165 --> 01:42:33.928]  They had, you know, it's hard to find somebody that didn't know someone or had a relative that was killed or badly hurt.
[01:42:34.788 --> 01:42:36.709]  And then it went on.
[01:42:36.949 --> 01:42:38.369]  It didn't just go away after that.
[01:42:38.429 --> 01:42:39.570]  It went on for years.
[01:42:40.456 --> 01:42:41.856]  And so people got tired of it.
[01:42:41.876 --> 01:42:44.677]  They were emotionally just... Sick of it.
[01:42:45.177 --> 01:42:46.177]  Wrenched, you know.
[01:42:46.918 --> 01:42:52.959]  But I mean, how did they deal with all those newscasts reporting the bombs and then later newscasts saying there were Iraqis involved in all this?
[01:42:53.579 --> 01:42:57.420]  I mean, when they call you a kook, would you raise those points?
[01:42:58.521 --> 01:43:03.842]  Yeah, and I think most people believed it, but I think it was an emotional thing is why they eventually go along.
[01:43:04.502 --> 01:43:13.410]  You know, they kind of go along with the entities, whether it's the newspapers or other politicians that attack the messenger.
[01:43:13.891 --> 01:43:17.094]  They go along with them because it's an emotional... Yeah, it's too scary.
[01:43:17.214 --> 01:43:18.575]  It's too scary to admit the truth.
[01:43:18.855 --> 01:43:19.996]  Thank you, John.
[01:43:20.757 --> 01:43:26.662]  Charles in New Hampshire, final caller for Representative Charles Key, coming up after
[01:43:27.884 --> 01:43:28.625]  This quick break.
[01:43:28.685 --> 01:43:32.950]  So we've got a final segment coming up straight ahead.
[01:43:33.451 --> 01:43:35.893]  We've got a lot of other callers, but we'll see how many we can get in here.
[01:43:36.754 --> 01:43:37.015]  Okay.
[01:43:44.412 --> 01:43:47.795]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:43:47.935 --> 01:43:53.159]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:43:53.339 --> 01:43:58.123]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:43:58.503 --> 01:44:09.612]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:44:10.012 --> 01:44:15.558]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:44:15.778 --> 01:44:21.864]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:44:22.044 --> 01:44:22.704]  What about you?

[01:44:50.474 --> 01:44:52.195]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.

[01:44:53.856 --> 01:44:55.277]  America, freedom to fascism.

[01:45:43.089 --> 01:45:46.050]  If you're an adult male, you need to listen to this information.
[01:45:46.270 --> 01:45:50.172]  By the age of 60, half of all men have a prostate-related problem.
[01:45:50.392 --> 01:45:54.414]  In the past, many men have turned to saw palmetto to support prostate health.
[01:45:54.834 --> 01:45:56.715]  But now, there's something much better.
[01:45:56.995 --> 01:45:58.375]  It's called beta-prostate.
[01:45:58.635 --> 01:46:03.878]  Beta-prostate contains 3,000 times more healthy plant sterols than ordinary saw palmetto.
[01:46:04.138 --> 01:46:10.000]  In fact, you'd have to take 100 saw palmetto capsules to get the same benefits of one dose of beta-prostate.
[01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:15.721]  It's guaranteed to provide noticeable support, even if you're already having prostate-related health issues.
[01:46:16.041 --> 01:46:19.902]  Now you can get Roger Mason's Beta Prostate Formula through this special offer.
[01:46:20.142 --> 01:46:24.322]  And if you call now, you'll learn how to get a free bottle of Beta Prostate with your order.
[01:46:24.643 --> 01:46:26.443]  Feel a difference or your money back.
[01:46:26.683 --> 01:46:27.423]  Here's how to order.
[01:46:27.683 --> 01:46:29.403]  Call now to order Beta Prostate.
[01:46:29.563 --> 01:46:30.023]  Dial 1-800-457-9914.
[01:46:30.043 --> 01:46:31.824]  Support your prostate with safe, all-natural ingredients.
[01:46:31.844 --> 01:46:32.104]  Dial 1-800-457-9914.
[01:46:39.349 --> 01:46:39.749]  That's 1-800-457-9914.
[01:46:39.769 --> 01:46:42.170]  Before you slip into unconsciousness, I'd like to have another kiss,
[01:47:06.701 --> 01:47:07.762]  Getting you thinking.
[01:47:07.822 --> 01:47:08.923]  That's what we're doing here.
[01:47:09.884 --> 01:47:13.048]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 3 p.m.
[01:47:13.088 --> 01:47:13.468]  Central.
[01:47:13.528 --> 01:47:15.110]  I'm back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:47:15.950 --> 01:47:19.434]  Got loaded phone lines here, but all I have time to take is Charles and New Hampshire.
[01:47:19.754 --> 01:47:25.140]  Before we do that, Charles Key, any websites, anything you think people should check into or learn more from?
[01:47:26.604 --> 01:47:29.725]  Well, I really don't have anything prepared to pass on, Alex.
[01:47:30.285 --> 01:47:36.508]  Well, I just want to thank you for your tireless defense of the Republic, and I just wish we had more people like you in public service.
[01:47:37.108 --> 01:47:38.208]  Well, I appreciate that very much.
[01:47:38.649 --> 01:47:39.829]  Let's take a final call.
[01:47:40.249 --> 01:47:41.810]  Charles in New Hampshire, go ahead.
[01:47:42.330 --> 01:47:44.431]  Yeah, thank you very much for taking my call.
[01:47:45.191 --> 01:47:55.375]  Representative Key, it's just a wonderful surprise and pleasure to know that you're back on the Hill, 47 years of age, and been around, you know, paying attention to these things for quite some time, and I remember
[01:47:56.143 --> 01:48:06.006]  uh... you sticking out back in and the oklahoma bombing as being one of the the few if not the only one that was uh... courageous enough to uh... really look into this thing
[01:48:06.656 --> 01:48:11.482]  And I just can't say how happy I am that you're back, along with Representative Paul.
[01:48:11.882 --> 01:48:28.100]  My inquiry here specifically, because logically and common sense-wise, I remember when they were able to find out about the Ryder truck with supposedly an unscathed VIN number that just happened to miraculously survive this.
[01:48:28.599 --> 01:48:30.622]  Huge blast in the rider truck.
[01:48:30.943 --> 01:48:41.078]  It reminds me of 19 box cutters at 9-11 that somehow got through the metal detectors and no one has been able to bring out a box cutter, at least the metal part where it cuts.
[01:48:43.218 --> 01:48:48.421]  And what I understand, in some of the pictures that I've seen, I'm still waiting to see a hole in the ground.
[01:48:48.701 --> 01:48:52.143]  And wasn't the Murray Building a nuclear fallout shelter?
[01:48:52.323 --> 01:48:55.164]  It's just certain things, common sense, don't add up.
[01:48:55.364 --> 01:48:57.085]  Okay, thanks for the call.
[01:48:57.105 --> 01:48:59.927]  Let me get a final comment from Charles Key on that.
[01:49:01.628 --> 01:49:11.453]  Well, you know, there's been a lot of time passed by, so I'm not sure I recall anything like that, but it did have some lower levels in it, and it had a lower
[01:49:12.748 --> 01:49:16.589]  Level parking garage that actually was, I think, two levels deep below the ground level.
[01:49:16.609 --> 01:49:18.629]  Well, I remember the VIN number saying off the car.
[01:49:19.270 --> 01:49:20.010]  Yeah, the VIN number.
[01:49:20.030 --> 01:49:26.071]  I mean, there's a lot of odd things that happen in the Oklahoma City case, and that may be some real good, you know, evidence.
[01:49:26.191 --> 01:49:41.075]  And not that that's not worthy of talking about it when I make my next comment, but the fact is, you know, there's a wealth of information that proves that there were other people involved that our Justice Department and FBI did not want to go after those people.
[01:49:41.095 --> 01:49:42.115]  They intentionally did not.
[01:49:42.688 --> 01:49:50.110]  And, you know, to close up with back to the Tenth Amendment and the Constitution, we must hold government accountable at every level.
[01:49:50.630 --> 01:49:52.551]  If we don't, things get out of control.
[01:49:53.071 --> 01:50:02.493]  And not only do they take more of your money, more of your privacy, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and the list goes on, but things like the Oklahoma City bombing can happen.
[01:50:02.693 --> 01:50:03.294]  Absolutely.
[01:50:03.614 --> 01:50:06.514]  Charles Key, I really appreciate you spending time with us.
[01:50:06.535 --> 01:50:08.815]  I want to get you back up in the near future if you'll give us the time.
[01:50:09.115 --> 01:50:09.815]  Thank you for the time.
[01:50:10.276 --> 01:50:10.916]  Thank you for having me.
[01:50:12.076 --> 01:50:13.316]  We're out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:13.336 --> 01:50:16.557]  I'll be back this Saturday, live, 4 to 6 p.m., and then all next week.
[01:50:17.598 --> 01:50:19.798]  Truth Rising is coming out on DVD.
[01:50:19.878 --> 01:50:20.578]  You can order it now.
[01:50:20.618 --> 01:50:21.459]  It ships next week.

[01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:29.941]  And don't forget other sponsors that make the show possible, like Interfood.
[01:50:30.441 --> 01:50:32.922]  It is the best green food out there, bar none.
[01:50:33.662 --> 01:50:34.442]  I take it every day.
[01:50:34.462 --> 01:50:37.283]  Two little bitty scoops of orange juice or apple juice.
[01:50:37.403 --> 01:50:39.164]  Dulse kelp, barley, grass.
[01:50:40.124 --> 01:50:45.946]  There is Wheatgrass, Colrina, Spirulina, and 14 other superfoods.
[01:50:46.486 --> 01:50:47.907]  Balance energy all day long.
[01:50:48.007 --> 01:50:49.027]  Greater mental clarity.
[01:50:49.087 --> 01:50:50.008]  Reduce food cravings.
