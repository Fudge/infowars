[00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:00.596]  We're good to go.
[00:00:19.622 --> 00:00:31.185]  We are live at PrisonPlanet.tv for viewers right now and we'll be streaming video for the full two hours with Jordan Maxwell coming up in the third and fourth hour today.
[00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:46.670]  Mark Dice is coming up in thirty minutes with a quick ten minute report on the latest developments with Michael Reagan coming out and saying murder children by putting hand grenades into their... I can't even say it on air, it's total perverts what they're into.
[00:00:47.703 --> 00:00:50.145]  You'll see that mantra in all their documents, their torture.
[00:00:50.185 --> 00:00:50.945]  It's an obsession.
[00:00:50.965 --> 00:00:54.067]  They're legalizing macabre Jeffrey Dahmer type stuff.
[00:00:55.068 --> 00:01:02.892]  So he'll be popping in with us on the latest on saying kill 9-11 truthers, kill anybody that tries to wake the troops up, murderous, contract killings, the rest of it.
[00:01:04.453 --> 00:01:06.514]  Also, Supreme Court meets Monday.
[00:01:06.535 --> 00:01:14.860]  They're going to announce this afternoon, or by the latest tomorrow, the Second Amendment death knell attack that will be billed as a Second Amendment victory.
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.380]  Remember that.
[00:01:17.937 --> 00:01:25.646]  Also, really one of the biggest news stories of the day, there's so much today, I'm going to spend time coming up in the next hour on this.
[00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:37.920]  I heard about this last Friday, I read the bill over the weekend, and it is so horrible that it's really hard to even telegraph the full magnitude of this.
[00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:47.095]  Have a small business, get ready for Dodd's eBay reporting provision.
[00:01:47.615 --> 00:02:03.924]  Buried in the 630 page housing bill, which is very popular obviously with the mortgage crisis, is a provision that expands Know Your Customer and other federal laws that violate the Fourth Amendment and violate the Fifth Amendment.
[00:02:05.865 --> 00:02:07.906]  And they've passed other laws.
[00:02:08.306 --> 00:02:11.367]  They passed back in, what, four years ago.
[00:02:11.387 --> 00:02:18.750]  It was billed in the news as, a new law will give you total privacy with your doctor and with medical records.
[00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:31.495]  But in there it states that any prescription, whether it's for a diaphragm or prescription ibuprofen, doesn't matter what it is, that it's instantly uploaded to the federal government.
[00:02:32.503 --> 00:02:33.804]  On these databases and systems.
[00:02:34.244 --> 00:02:38.148]  Forget a Fourth Amendment against unreasonable search and seizure.
[00:02:38.648 --> 00:02:40.690]  Forget a Fifth Amendment against incriminating yourselves.
[00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.272]  You see, we're all wired into the matrix.
[00:02:43.292 --> 00:02:48.176]  We're all under surveillance and then they tell the cattle, oh, you're not under surveillance.
[00:02:48.897 --> 00:02:49.417]  Remember Bush?
[00:02:49.477 --> 00:02:51.459]  Oh, we don't listen to people inside the U.S.
[00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:54.701]  without warrants and it comes out they're listening to everybody, non-terror related.
[00:02:55.442 --> 00:02:57.364]  And they say, okay, but it's to keep you safe.
[00:03:04.295 --> 00:03:12.664]  Under this, eBay, Amazon accounts, any website, any small shopping cart.
[00:03:12.684 --> 00:03:15.307]  A lot of these people have shopping carts that might make $200 a year.
[00:03:15.887 --> 00:03:18.090]  You know, with little dolls they knit.
[00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.914]  I know a lot of people that have their own shopping carts that might make $200 a year.
[00:03:21.934 --> 00:03:22.234]  I mean, gross!
[00:03:24.375 --> 00:03:31.561]  It says you will report, go under federal regulation, have to file reports and report every transaction in live time to them.
[00:03:32.082 --> 00:03:34.123]  Total violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendment.
[00:03:34.404 --> 00:03:51.899]  Now I told you that under the National ID Act, because I saw Ridge say it on television when he was Homeland Security Ed and it was on all the documents, and it was in United Nations agreements from 2000 on the World ID Taxation System, they said that when you even swipe your card at a brick-and-mortar store,
[00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:59.675]  You are going to have your name attached to even the cash that you're using.
[00:04:00.095 --> 00:04:02.496]  So you may pay with cash, but they're going to swipe your card.
[00:04:03.477 --> 00:04:09.141]  And the ostensible reason will be, well, we've got to decide which tax bracket you're in for sales tax.
[00:04:10.302 --> 00:04:16.486]  And they've also proposed, and have tried to pass at the state level, at the international level, and Europe's actually doing this in many countries,
[00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:44.316]  to then whatever you do on the web is instantly uploaded to a government website and then they surveil your account and the accounts in the software that by law they want to be built to automatically report where you don't even have a choice that's the next step ebay and amazon and others are already reporting on people that have sub pages and are selling and using them as a merchant and so uh... this will go into all cash registers all brick-and-mortar stores
[00:04:45.575 --> 00:04:46.556]  And that's only one.
[00:04:46.596 --> 00:05:02.632]  Remember two weeks ago I went over the five-pronged attack to destroy the internet and I said taxation regulation over every shopping cart, taxation over emails, taxation over bandwidth, and then I heard local talk show host in Austin endorsing it saying, oh this is a wonderful idea.
[00:05:02.652 --> 00:05:04.994]  These people are getting the web for free.
[00:05:05.855 --> 00:05:06.696]  You having to pay
[00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:15.477]  Even more taxes, and have everything you do tracked and traced, and have the power of even reporting on yourself, which violates the Fifth Amendment and Fourth Amendment.
[00:05:15.697 --> 00:05:17.118]  That's just being taken away.
[00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:19.580]  That is not a good thing.
[00:05:20.441 --> 00:05:27.768]  So first there's been denial about all this, and now it's happening, and people are maybe going to wake up to it.
[00:05:27.788 --> 00:05:34.734]  So I want to spend ten minutes of the next hour going through this, but that's also in the news.
[00:05:36.277 --> 00:05:37.038]  Have a small business?
[00:05:37.078 --> 00:05:44.605]  Get ready for Dodd's eBay reporting provision now that Congress has all but decimated the Fourth Amendment with the intrusive so-called FISA bill.
[00:05:44.905 --> 00:05:46.386]  It's time to go after small businesses.
[00:05:46.927 --> 00:05:55.515]  Deep in Senator Christopher Dodd's 630-page Senate housing legislation is a sweeping provision that affects the privacy and operation of nearly all American small businesses.
[00:05:55.815 --> 00:05:59.679]  The provision, which was added by the bill's managers without debate this week,
[00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:01.399]  That's outside of committee, folks.
[00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:02.600]  They add it right at the end.
[00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:11.182]  "...would require the nation's payment systems to track, aggregate, and report information on nearly every electronic transaction to the federal government," explains FreedomWorks.
[00:06:11.242 --> 00:06:15.563]  Now, this big public watchdog group read the bill.
[00:06:16.663 --> 00:06:19.024]  They did a decent job, but I've now analyzed it.
[00:06:19.684 --> 00:06:20.164]  Let me explain.
[00:06:20.184 --> 00:06:24.205]  Remember, I've been telling you, you heard about the governor.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:33.065]  of New York made a $10,000 transfer and his bank reported it to the FBI and that's how the prostitution sting started.
[00:06:33.405 --> 00:06:34.246]  Number one, that's not true.
[00:06:34.266 --> 00:06:35.526]  He was under surveillance before that.
[00:06:36.987 --> 00:06:38.609]  And then I came on air and I said, no, no, no, no.
[00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:42.211]  The banks are illegally, and that's why they're trying to pass legislation.
[00:06:42.711 --> 00:06:44.293]  Everything you do is uploaded.
[00:06:44.333 --> 00:06:47.455]  The government's in all of the bank's databases.
[00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:52.131]  Kind of like I told you in 96, the NSA doesn't tap your phones.
[00:06:52.211 --> 00:06:59.113]  People think when there's water in the lines or a tree falls down on a thing and it clicks, you know, in some phone system a hundred miles away that that's the government listening.
[00:06:59.193 --> 00:06:59.353]  No.
[00:06:59.893 --> 00:07:01.774]  That's a local tap if you're hearing clicking.
[00:07:02.034 --> 00:07:05.935]  Or a private eye doing it down the street from your house or under your house with a tap.
[00:07:06.695 --> 00:07:08.416]  That's the only time you hear clicking and stuff.
[00:07:08.956 --> 00:07:09.236]  Okay?
[00:07:10.339 --> 00:07:11.340]  You don't hear it clicking.
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.822]  The NSA doesn't tap the phone companies, they are the phone companies.
[00:07:16.223 --> 00:07:26.008]  Nine billion dollars of whole hubs in 96, 97, 98, 99 put in everywhere and then it came out a year and a half ago and now it's on Frontline, breaking news, oh my gosh.
[00:07:26.449 --> 00:07:29.690]  Whole floors at AT&T and everybody else are NSA.
[00:07:31.011 --> 00:07:32.152]  Everything runs through it.
[00:07:33.793 --> 00:07:36.875]  All I did was read the Telecommunications Act, the Deregulation Act.
[00:07:37.751 --> 00:07:44.273]  I mean, it's said by October 1st, every cell phone would be tracked in live time off GPS triangulation.
[00:07:45.933 --> 00:07:55.556]  Not GPS on the phone, GPS on the cell towers, triangulating you down to three feet, listening to you, tracking you, and they even, people denied that was happening when I had all the documents, and then they advertise it to you.
[00:07:55.576 --> 00:07:58.357]  Oh, track your kids, track yourself, track your husband!
[00:08:00.083 --> 00:08:10.209]  So now they're even making money off of the government tracking system that's on you, but someone who even knows that their phone tracks them will still deny that the government designed it, or by law, ordered that be put in.
[00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:14.611]  You see, this is the mega, massive, complete denial.
[00:08:14.931 --> 00:08:21.255]  I mean, I have the government documents where they put cancer viruses in your vaccines, where they said they wanted to kill you and your family, where they said they want to brain damage you.
[00:08:21.395 --> 00:08:23.016]  We've made films, we've covered them, we've read them.
[00:08:23.276 --> 00:08:24.377]  I read some on the air yesterday.
[00:08:24.417 --> 00:08:25.517]  People just say, not true!
[00:08:26.678 --> 00:08:27.999]  Usually it's not my opinion.
[00:08:29.428 --> 00:08:31.008]  People say, well you shouldn't get so upset.
[00:08:31.348 --> 00:08:38.310]  How can I rationally not get upset by what's happening when I know it's destroying our whole future?
[00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:42.110]  That I know that I'm living in a false reality.
[00:08:42.471 --> 00:08:44.691]  By that, the general public is in a false reality.
[00:08:44.971 --> 00:08:51.032]  They have no idea the magnitude of what the global engineers have built and are building around them.
[00:08:53.553 --> 00:08:55.013]  Okay, so I'm going to get more into that later.
[00:08:56.696 --> 00:08:59.137]  It's just completely diabolical.
[00:08:59.837 --> 00:09:04.819]  The average cop can't see it, the average FBI guy, the average school teacher, the average banker can't see it.
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.740]  It is so diabolical.
[00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:16.403]  It is at the scientist, think tank level, and there are thousands of people that plan this, who do know the full picture, and then a few hundred owners.
[00:09:16.763 --> 00:09:25.807]  And that's it, and they control it, they guide the whole thing, it's institutionalized, they do it in upgrades, globally, you'll see the same system, even have the same name put in,
[00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:30.693]  With the welfare workers, and the surveillance, and it's all being put into place.
[00:09:30.733 --> 00:09:33.275]  And every step they said they'd follow, they're following.
[00:09:33.795 --> 00:09:44.263]  Towards releasing controlled bioweapons releases, which they'll then use to claim that terrorists hit us, they need more security, tighten down us more, hit us even harder a few years later, tighten down more.
[00:09:44.903 --> 00:09:48.106]  And as the last of you are being killed in your compact bunker cities,
[00:09:49.042 --> 00:09:52.363]  The cops dying around you out in the streets won't even know it's their government doing it.
[00:09:52.883 --> 00:09:53.904]  It's their global system.
[00:09:54.144 --> 00:09:54.864]  It's their masters.
[00:09:55.504 --> 00:10:01.827]  They'll be looking under beds for Osama, or for whatever new terror group it is, never knowing it's their masters killing them.
[00:10:02.427 --> 00:10:10.690]  Now, I don't want to spend a lot of time on this right now, because we don't have a lot of time.
[00:10:13.021 --> 00:10:24.048]  We're going to take this clip right now and put it onto the Barry Jennings video and then put that out because I want to expand on the points that Vermus made in the video that's up on InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[00:10:26.257 --> 00:10:33.279]  There have been major new developments, and if you go to Infowars.com, you can see those big new developments in the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:39.262]  Emergency official witnessed dead bodies in the World Trade Center by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:10:39.782 --> 00:10:43.663]  At Infowars.com, Curt Nimmo has the story, bodies in WTC7.
[00:10:44.063 --> 00:10:46.804]  Jennings' interview demolishes official version.
[00:10:47.084 --> 00:10:51.546]  Let me briefly tell you what happened, then I'm going to throw it over to Burmese, and we're going to play the clip of Barry Jennings.
[00:10:52.895 --> 00:10:57.356]  Barry Jennings was the Deputy Head of Emergency Management there for New York City.
[00:10:58.717 --> 00:10:59.977]  He went into Building 7.
[00:11:00.157 --> 00:11:03.198]  There were steaming coffee sandwiches.
[00:11:03.718 --> 00:11:05.839]  They were told, get out of the building with a phone call.
[00:11:06.139 --> 00:11:06.799]  They get out.
[00:11:06.839 --> 00:11:08.399]  There's explosions that have gone off.
[00:11:08.599 --> 00:11:10.060]  He's stepping over dead bodies.
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.581]  And this is before either North or South Tower, the 110-story towers, had fallen.
[00:11:18.999 --> 00:11:22.760]  He had told some local news that, on record that day.
[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:29.662]  So Jason Burmiss and Dylan Avery and Corey Rove, they go out a year ago for Loose Change Final Cut.
[00:11:29.942 --> 00:11:30.502]  They interview him.
[00:11:31.022 --> 00:11:33.283]  They play little clips on air but don't say who he is.
[00:11:35.063 --> 00:11:36.863]  And suddenly he gets threats.
[00:11:36.883 --> 00:11:37.884]  They threaten to fire him.
[00:11:37.944 --> 00:11:38.844]  All this stuff happens.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:48.836]  And so, even though he agrees that we can use it, and we have that contractually, him agreeing to use it, and whether it be important for the movement, important to get it out, we didn't put it out.
[00:11:50.719 --> 00:11:53.204]  I was one of the executive producers on Lose Change Final Cut.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:12:03.768]  Then, the BBC backtracks who it is, this Guy Smith guy, who came and interviewed me and did this hit piece, a previous hit piece on 9-11, and I'd say, what about Northwoods?
[00:12:03.788 --> 00:12:04.269]  What about U.S.
[00:12:04.289 --> 00:12:06.431]  troops massing to invade Afghanistan the weeks before?
[00:12:06.831 --> 00:12:09.093]  And he would, no, no, that's not going in the piece.
[00:12:09.494 --> 00:12:10.054]  Total hit piece.
[00:12:10.114 --> 00:12:11.956]  And at the end of it, he said it was fair and balanced.
[00:12:11.996 --> 00:12:14.478]  At the end, he just laughed at me and told me I was a nut.
[00:12:15.563 --> 00:12:16.324]  It was a big joke.
[00:12:16.364 --> 00:12:18.005]  I mean, totally disingenuous.
[00:12:18.645 --> 00:12:29.174]  Then, about a month ago, I was on BBC Radio debating him, and he said he was involved in this new Building 7 piece that's coming out, and they interviewed Barry Jennings for it, and we've seen the trailer.
[00:12:30.034 --> 00:12:33.037]  Now, a few months ago, they interviewed Dylan Avery in Denver for this.
[00:12:34.304 --> 00:12:38.086]  And the same guy, Smith, and he comes over and says, I hear it's a lie.
[00:12:38.227 --> 00:12:45.951]  I hear that you guys are making it up that Barry Jennings said that he was stepping over bodies in Building 7 or there were explosions.
[00:12:46.532 --> 00:12:47.953]  And I hear there's not video of him.
[00:12:48.313 --> 00:12:49.674]  Well, Dylan happened to have it on his phone.
[00:12:50.754 --> 00:12:51.234]  And played it!
[00:12:51.854 --> 00:12:52.935]  And tried to play it for the cameras.
[00:12:53.035 --> 00:12:58.696]  I'll bet bottom dollar unless they pull it and re-edit it and we expose the History Channel when they did delay it a few weeks and did change some stuff.
[00:12:58.996 --> 00:13:05.738]  Because I pointed out that Hearst Publishing owned it and that I had heard they had an ad for the book not letting them know it was conflict of interest.
[00:13:06.238 --> 00:13:07.859]  And so they did have to go cut that out of the...
[00:13:08.579 --> 00:13:08.839]  Of course!
[00:13:24.881 --> 00:13:27.324]  You know, and Dylan says, no, here's the clip.
[00:13:27.724 --> 00:13:28.645]  So we want it on record.
[00:13:28.705 --> 00:13:29.806]  They were shown this clip.
[00:13:30.307 --> 00:13:31.668]  They were shown what you're about to hear.
[00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:36.433]  Jason, you did a great job on that YouTube video you and Aaron put up.
[00:13:36.493 --> 00:13:42.179]  It's up on InfoWars, but in the next six, seven hours, we're going to get a new video up with this info, and this is what's important.
[00:13:42.199 --> 00:13:43.660]  People need to understand that
[00:13:45.393 --> 00:13:51.156]  We had to put this video out because now they're going to try to misrepresent or spin what Jennings has been saying.
[00:13:51.356 --> 00:13:56.199]  When all along, you guys saw him on the news say something similar, you just went and got the interview with him.
[00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:03.163]  The BBC is also going to try to cover up why they announced Building 7 fell.
[00:14:03.503 --> 00:14:04.324]  A lot of stuff's happening.
[00:14:04.364 --> 00:14:04.644]  Jason?
[00:14:05.264 --> 00:14:05.724]  Absolutely.
[00:14:05.965 --> 00:14:07.725]  We got this interview last year.
[00:14:08.846 --> 00:14:09.706]  In June, actually.
[00:14:10.746 --> 00:14:12.067]  And he was a really nice guy.
[00:14:12.607 --> 00:14:14.207]  He had seen the loose change 2nd edition.
[00:14:14.227 --> 00:14:16.528]  He'd even played it in his office for other co-workers.
[00:14:17.428 --> 00:14:18.988]  He didn't believe the official version at all.
[00:14:19.048 --> 00:14:23.509]  It's very apparent in the interview that we do, even in the little bits and pieces we put out there.
[00:14:24.109 --> 00:14:28.190]  And he did say that those explosions happened prior to either building collapse.
[00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:32.491]  He was trapped on the 8th floor until about 12.30, 1 in the afternoon.
[00:14:32.511 --> 00:14:34.171]  And when they did get him down into the lobby,
[00:14:34.751 --> 00:14:36.012]  He was stepping over bodies.
[00:14:36.072 --> 00:14:37.353]  I mean, it's as clear as day.
[00:14:37.393 --> 00:14:43.618]  And we know that the official version, the 9-11 Commission report, and 9-11 commissioners have said there was no loss of life in that building.
[00:14:43.938 --> 00:14:45.820]  Well, we know there was loss of life in that building.
[00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:47.781]  It was just an excuse for them not to cover it.
[00:14:47.801 --> 00:14:50.984]  But it came out years later that Secret Service agents and others did die.
[00:14:51.124 --> 00:14:51.564]  That's right.
[00:14:51.625 --> 00:14:55.528]  And there's bombs going off, explosions, nothing in any of the other buildings.
[00:14:55.669 --> 00:14:56.910]  The other towers are smoking.
[00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:57.831]  They haven't collapsed.
[00:14:57.851 --> 00:15:01.875]  And there's explosions going off, I guess to clear people out of there.
[00:15:02.175 --> 00:15:03.476]  And they're saying, don't look down.
[00:15:04.277 --> 00:15:06.219]  And there's bodies that he's stepping over.
[00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:12.726]  And the larger issue here is, when we said we had this interview, the debunkers who were congenital liars admit that they lie.
[00:15:13.626 --> 00:15:14.427]  to fool the public.
[00:15:14.487 --> 00:15:16.770]  They said we were liars and said that we didn't have this tape.
[00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:18.692]  Then they said Jennings didn't say that.
[00:15:18.972 --> 00:15:24.097]  Now they've got the BBC coming out and saying that, so we have to set the record straight and put this out.
[00:15:24.137 --> 00:15:29.643]  But it's not just Jennings, it's other firefighters, police, emergency workers saying there was a countdown to bring seven down later.
[00:15:30.183 --> 00:15:30.683]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:15:30.703 --> 00:15:32.525]  That's the Kevin McPadden story.
[00:15:33.385 --> 00:15:36.927]  But when you look at it, I mean, this is a 47-story skyscraper.
[00:15:37.187 --> 00:15:38.488]  It is a ultra-spook house.
[00:15:38.548 --> 00:15:40.870]  We have the largest CIA base outside of Langley.
[00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:42.791]  We have the largest Secret Service office in the world.
[00:15:43.751 --> 00:15:52.017]  And the two emergency workers that went up there, Barry Jennings and Michael Hess, went to an abandoned Office of Emergency Management.
[00:15:53.012 --> 00:15:53.992]  This should have been fully manned.
[00:15:54.693 --> 00:15:59.054]  They were both shocked to see that there was, you know, still hot coffee, half-eaten sandwiches.
[00:15:59.314 --> 00:16:03.935]  Michael Hess was actually there to meet Giuliani, who had gotten a warning to get out that morning.
[00:16:04.676 --> 00:16:12.378]  Although that's not on the YouTube clip, Barry Jennings does mention that Hess was there to see Giuliani and was freaking out because he couldn't get a hold of the mayor.
[00:16:13.278 --> 00:16:17.980]  So, why was this Office of Emergency Management totally evacuated?
[00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:25.663]  And why is it that someone called Barry, and once he found out he was in Seven, told him to immediately leave if there was no threat?
[00:16:25.843 --> 00:16:27.783]  Yeah, we need another article at Prison Planet.
[00:16:29.324 --> 00:16:37.146]  Basically headline, you know, emergency manager says bombs and buildings, dead bodies, you know, why this is an important interview.
[00:16:37.407 --> 00:16:39.387]  You know, A, they're trying to suppress it and spin it.
[00:16:39.727 --> 00:16:41.048]  B, they said it didn't exist.
[00:16:41.248 --> 00:16:43.708]  C, he corroborates what other people are saying.
[00:16:43.748 --> 00:16:45.809]  He's an emergency manager, deputy head.
[00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:55.132]  I mean, you start adding all this together, he's corroborating the bombs, he's corroborating big explosions and dead bodies before either of the two towers, you know, hundreds of yards away collapse.
[00:16:56.272 --> 00:16:58.033]  It's just absolutely amazing.
[00:16:58.473 --> 00:17:06.760]  And now they've obviously pressured him and gone and interviewed him, but watching some of the clips online, it sounds like he almost says the same thing, but then they just tell you, oh, that's not what you really heard.
[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:19.149]  Kind of like the spin that the producer of this new hit piece, Guy Smith, when I was debating him on radio, he said, well, they knew the building was going to come down all day, so BBC just got it wrong and said that it had already come down.
[00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:21.752]  Yeah, magically, three buildings never collapsed from fire.
[00:17:22.492 --> 00:17:31.195]  Modern Steel Buildings, now three of them do, and then magically BBC and CNN say it's collapsed in its own footprint, a total collapse, and then they give the official collapse.
[00:17:31.775 --> 00:17:45.819]  I mean, it's like them trying to make excuses about New Zealand, Australian, and Thailand newspapers reporting before Lee Harvey Oswald was even captured, before his name was out in the U.S., having it printed that Lee Harvey Oswald shot the President.
[00:17:45.879 --> 00:17:47.540]  Well, they got a time zone off by an hour.
[00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:49.001]  And that's admitted.
[00:17:49.281 --> 00:17:50.984]  I mean, you guys can't get away with this stuff.
[00:17:51.484 --> 00:17:53.467]  I mean, you run your black ops, you're going to be exposed.
[00:17:53.507 --> 00:17:54.187]  Stay there, Jason.
[00:17:54.428 --> 00:17:54.948]  Let's come back.
[00:17:54.988 --> 00:17:56.210]  Folks, this is huge news.
[00:17:56.691 --> 00:17:58.413]  Make sure this video gets out to everybody.
[00:17:58.753 --> 00:17:59.174]  Stay with us.
[00:18:00.825 --> 00:18:13.556]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:18:13.976 --> 00:18:20.742]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[00:18:21.082 --> 00:18:24.625]  And the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:18:50.902 --> 00:18:57.047]  Another untold story, here it comes Another untold story, here it comes Another untold story that you have not been told from Another untold story dot com
[00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:27.912]  Did you go and see the picture of the amazing recent discovery at website anotheruntoldstory.com?
[00:19:28.092 --> 00:19:30.412]  We told you the story in the last broadcast.
[00:19:30.973 --> 00:19:34.494]  Story of an astonishing discovery, a thousand-year-old book.
[00:19:35.074 --> 00:19:40.815]  Leather book perfectly preserved by the tannic acid in the dark, damp potting soil bog in Ireland.
[00:19:41.576 --> 00:19:42.776]  The very book, U.S.
[00:19:42.836 --> 00:19:50.458]  Public Law 97-280, says you and I need to read, says our nation and government was based on.
[00:19:51.394 --> 00:19:53.455]  What are the chances of the discovery?
[00:19:53.935 --> 00:19:56.696]  The chances of the backhoe operator spotting it?
[00:19:57.296 --> 00:20:00.657]  The chances of it being open to the page it was open to?
[00:20:01.277 --> 00:20:03.758]  A prophetic prayer page, a prophecy.
[00:20:04.198 --> 00:20:11.901]  National Geographic used the word potentiously, potentiously open to, to the very page it was open to.
[00:20:12.321 --> 00:20:17.943]  The word potentious means ominous, threatening, fateful, menacing, foreboding, ill omen.
[00:20:18.263 --> 00:20:20.884]  And what were the words on that page?
[00:20:21.304 --> 00:20:22.585]  That page of prophecy?
[00:20:22.745 --> 00:20:26.667]  You can read them at the website anotheruntoldstory.com.
[00:20:26.907 --> 00:20:33.571]  The words are Another Untold Story that may explain the suspicious strange storms that the world is seeing.

[00:21:14.701 --> 00:21:16.062]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:17.103 --> 00:21:18.504]  Huge 9-11 developments.
[00:21:18.524 --> 00:21:20.185]  We need your help getting this story out.
[00:21:21.345 --> 00:21:24.828]  Barry Jennings, deputy head of the Office of Emergency Management in New York City.
[00:21:27.475 --> 00:21:33.199]  On the day of 9-11, he came out and said, man, there were bombs, things going off, dead people in Building 7 before either tower fell.
[00:21:33.579 --> 00:21:34.679]  The media covered that up.
[00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:38.862]  Jason Burma, Dylan Avery, the Loose Change crew, they went, they interviewed him.
[00:21:38.882 --> 00:21:40.723]  They were going to put it in Loose Change Final Cut.
[00:21:41.143 --> 00:21:45.546]  They just made noises about somebody high up in the emergency system saying this.
[00:21:46.107 --> 00:21:50.990]  The establishment figured out who it was and went and threatened him, threatened his job, things like that.
[00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:52.651]  He called Dylan and others and told them that.
[00:21:53.651 --> 00:21:56.353]  Said, I know I said you could use it, but please don't put it in your film.
[00:21:58.214 --> 00:22:06.619]  And even though we had a moral responsibility to put it out to everybody, I argued against it, but I wasn't going to try that, even though I was the executive producer and could probably have, you know, made them do it.
[00:22:06.659 --> 00:22:08.080]  I said, fine, but this is a big mistake.
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:24.169]  And then the neocons came out and said we were liars, we didn't have this interview, it didn't exist, Barry Jennings had never said that, and then there's this BBC guy who did this big disingenuous hit piece, told me it wasn't a hit piece, but then a few days into the interview with him,
[00:22:25.011 --> 00:22:27.832]  This is a part two he's doing on Building 7 last year.
[00:22:27.852 --> 00:22:30.893]  He just starts laughing at me and saying, I think you're nuts.
[00:22:31.313 --> 00:22:33.313]  And I mean, literally just laughing with his crew.
[00:22:33.353 --> 00:22:35.194]  And I was like, whoa, I've never had this happen.
[00:22:35.734 --> 00:22:37.595]  I mean, literally just like giggling.
[00:22:37.615 --> 00:22:40.095]  And I'd say, but what about Building 7?
[00:22:40.936 --> 00:22:42.596]  What about Operation Northwoods?
[00:22:43.617 --> 00:22:44.917]  What about how the U.S.
[00:22:45.017 --> 00:22:48.538]  masked all these troops to invade Afghanistan in the months before?
[00:22:48.578 --> 00:22:50.419]  And he just said, we're not putting that in the film.
[00:22:50.439 --> 00:22:51.359]  And he just would laugh at me.
[00:22:52.359 --> 00:23:02.665]  And then they went and said that the Loose Change guys had said that there was paper found in a lake that was only a mile away, but that we used MapQuest and it showed four miles.
[00:23:03.086 --> 00:23:07.208]  When we never said that, the Associated Press and others said eight miles away.
[00:23:07.688 --> 00:23:09.630]  Eyewitnesses said that who people have interviewed.
[00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:11.471]  There was news footage of it.
[00:23:11.791 --> 00:23:14.072]  So it was all straw men, just made up.
[00:23:14.152 --> 00:23:14.713]  That's what they do.
[00:23:14.733 --> 00:23:16.174]  They make up stuff we haven't said.
[00:23:16.934 --> 00:23:23.899]  Or they go get kooky 9-11 truth groups who are operatives or mentally ill and then say that we are saying what they say.
[00:23:24.999 --> 00:23:33.224]  And so I again debated Guy Smith on the radio and he said, told me a few months ago, yeah I got a BBC piece on Building 7 coming out.
[00:23:34.065 --> 00:23:36.687]  And I said, oh yeah, and BBC says they've lost the tapes.
[00:23:37.782 --> 00:23:47.287]  uh... of uh... that day when they announced that the building fell, building seven before it did, twenty five minutes and he said real slightly, oh we found them again and giggled.
[00:23:47.327 --> 00:23:48.768]  We ought to get those clips off that interview.
[00:23:49.448 --> 00:23:50.209]  See how funny it is?
[00:23:50.229 --> 00:23:57.833]  They had five to one debating me on that show and would fade me down and wouldn't give me any time but but that's the point when people demanded the tapes
[00:23:58.649 --> 00:24:00.630]  Because at first, BBC was denying it was real.
[00:24:01.051 --> 00:24:03.132]  Then they said, OK, it is real, but we don't have the tapes.
[00:24:03.753 --> 00:24:05.794]  And they said, oh, we found them, and then he giggles.
[00:24:06.294 --> 00:24:09.697]  It's very funny, you know, to manipulate the slaves, to be on a power trip.
[00:24:10.377 --> 00:24:10.617]  And then...
[00:24:12.881 --> 00:24:18.324]  They're now putting this out, and they supposedly have Barry Jennings debunking in that.
[00:24:18.464 --> 00:24:20.125]  So, we've just put the video out.
[00:24:20.445 --> 00:24:20.905]  A bunch of it.
[00:24:20.925 --> 00:24:21.966]  There's more we'll be putting out.
[00:24:22.206 --> 00:24:23.367]  It'll be in the film, Fabled Enemies.
[00:24:24.267 --> 00:24:26.629]  But that's only one issue of why we're releasing this.
[00:24:26.969 --> 00:24:39.756]  The other keys here, I mean, the bombs in the building, the fact that there was explosions before Tower 1 or 2 fell, the fact that Giuliani was out of the building, the fact they were told to get out of the building, the fact Giuliani later admitted that, then denied he said it, and then had to admit it.
[00:24:39.996 --> 00:24:41.457]  See, I mean, we've caught them here, folks.
[00:24:42.113 --> 00:24:47.434]  Yeah, absolutely, and another big issue is that supposedly the 9-11 Commission found no evidence of this.
[00:24:47.514 --> 00:24:52.055]  This is what Thomas Kean set out in Texas, and we have it in loose change, final cut.
[00:24:52.495 --> 00:24:56.016]  Well, how could they have no evidence of dead bodies when they talked to Barry Jennings?
[00:24:56.056 --> 00:25:02.057]  How could they have no evidence of explosions in the building prior to either tower collapse when they talked to Barry Jennings?
[00:25:02.077 --> 00:25:03.298]  And it was several years after
[00:25:04.938 --> 00:25:06.720]  Well, that's why this is a big deal.
[00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:09.223]  There was an attempted cover-up of this out of the goodness of our own hearts.
[00:25:20.154 --> 00:25:21.194]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:25:50.518 --> 00:25:52.179]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[00:25:52.479 --> 00:25:55.922]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:25:56.102 --> 00:25:57.943]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:25:58.424 --> 00:26:01.166]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:26:01.226 --> 00:26:02.847]  Go ahead and get Dyson on in five minutes.
[00:26:02.887 --> 00:26:04.048]  Hey, Jones?
[00:26:04.768 --> 00:26:05.148]  Thanks, buddy.
[00:26:05.709 --> 00:26:05.989]  Jones?
[00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:09.552]  Burmese was saying, we're going to recap it all in one minute.
[00:26:14.995 --> 00:26:16.556]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:26:22.859 --> 00:26:24.520]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:28.262]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:26:28.443 --> 00:26:30.284]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:26:30.904 --> 00:26:33.626]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:26:33.926 --> 00:26:39.409]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:43.552]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:26:43.892 --> 00:26:48.836]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.TV is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[00:26:49.096 --> 00:26:51.878]  PrisonPlanet.TV is a vault of forbidden information.
[00:26:52.158 --> 00:26:59.003]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded or streamed in super high quality directly to your computer or iPhone and shared with others.
[00:27:04.827 --> 00:27:05.487]  Big Brother.
[00:27:06.148 --> 00:27:07.188]  Mainstream media.
[00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:09.010]  Government cover-ups.
[00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:10.491]  You want answers?
[00:27:11.231 --> 00:27:12.012]  Well, so does he.
[00:27:12.779 --> 00:27:16.380]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:21.062]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27:22.222 --> 00:27:25.703]  We're going to play the very Jennings clip here in just a moment.
[00:27:27.604 --> 00:27:41.828]  But recapping, Barmus, in the next four and a half minutes, break down why we're doing this and why it is important and why it's so big for listeners to get this video out to everybody, to explain to everyone why this is so important.
[00:27:42.722 --> 00:27:51.306]  First of all, it is very important for the listeners to get this out because this totally and completely eviscerates the official version as of the 9-11 Commission Report.
[00:27:51.806 --> 00:27:52.407]  Without a doubt.
[00:27:52.447 --> 00:27:53.967]  So let's go through the points here.
[00:27:54.028 --> 00:27:55.188]  What happened to Barry Jennings?
[00:27:55.708 --> 00:27:56.249]  Point one.
[00:27:56.989 --> 00:27:59.350]  He was called after the first plane strike.
[00:27:59.590 --> 00:27:59.850]  Okay.
[00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:03.712]  So he was in the building prior to the second plane strike.
[00:28:03.732 --> 00:28:04.713]  That is also in the video.
[00:28:05.453 --> 00:28:15.878]  Now, when he's taken up to the Office of Emergency Management on the 23rd floor, he is with Michael Hess, who is the City Corporation Counsel at the time, and now heads up Giuliani Partners.
[00:28:16.678 --> 00:28:22.981]  When they go up to the Office of Emergency Management, which should have been fully manned, it had been deserted.
[00:28:23.562 --> 00:28:23.862]  Okay?
[00:28:24.822 --> 00:28:26.403]  Now, the elevators were all shut off.
[00:28:26.443 --> 00:28:31.465]  They had been taken up by a police triage that was already at the building through a freight elevator.
[00:28:32.226 --> 00:28:34.467]  So, Michael Hess found the stairwell.
[00:28:35.347 --> 00:28:43.534]  They start going down the stairwell, again this is prior to either tower collapsing, and there is a huge explosion from underneath them that pushes them back to the 8th floor.
[00:28:43.614 --> 00:28:44.695]  Now this is all on record.
[00:28:45.456 --> 00:28:55.044]  Now they're stuck in that building hearing all types of explosions thinking that they're going to die until about 12.30 to 1 in the afternoon, when the firefighters finally do come down to get them.
[00:28:56.065 --> 00:28:59.589]  They come to a lobby that is unrecognizable, that is blown to kingdom come.
[00:28:59.629 --> 00:29:05.835]  And this is very important, too, because in this little video, in the wrap-up, I show you what the Millennium Hilton looks like the next day.
[00:29:06.236 --> 00:29:12.242]  Not only on the facade on the outside, but I take you inside the Millennium Hilton, where literally there's still vases, the couches are okay.
[00:29:13.476 --> 00:29:25.682]  By the way, we also have video of the front of Building 7, and it's got a few windows knocked down, and we know that Poplar Mechanics is showing a gray-faced building that's got the corner knocked out when the Building 7 was red.
[00:29:26.102 --> 00:29:27.383]  It's a fake!
[00:29:27.423 --> 00:29:30.404]  These are the folks that gave you the Remington photos for the Spanish-American War!
[00:29:30.884 --> 00:29:32.605]  I mean, there's no end to these people!
[00:29:32.885 --> 00:29:34.346]  That seems to be the case.
[00:29:34.386 --> 00:29:39.350]  There seems to be no video corroboration whatsoever for that quote-unquote chunk of the building missing.
[00:29:39.971 --> 00:29:49.778]  Now we also show you in this video footage after at least one of the towers has collapsed of inside building seven where they literally run up to the main lobby from the south face.
[00:29:50.218 --> 00:29:54.542]  Now the south face has a couple windows knocked out but it's not this towering inferno.
[00:29:54.782 --> 00:29:58.104]  There's not quote-unquote twenty five percent of the building scooped out.
[00:29:59.025 --> 00:30:10.494]  Now, another big point is the fact that when Barry Jennings and Michael Hess got out of the building, they both went on separate local news programs and told the exact same story.
[00:30:10.734 --> 00:30:12.096]  It was never followed up upon.
[00:30:12.536 --> 00:30:26.467]  It was only until years later, when we put two and two together, that the man Barry Jennings, who was in the FEMA report describing these explosions, which was brushed off as the first tower falling, was the same man that was on the videos with Michael Hess.
[00:30:26.567 --> 00:30:30.630]  And you went and interviewed him and said, no, there were explosions before either tower fell.
[00:30:30.971 --> 00:30:33.553]  Again, proving more lies in the commission.
[00:30:33.573 --> 00:30:34.994]  I mean, this is so key, folks.
[00:30:35.554 --> 00:30:36.014]  Absolutely.
[00:30:36.035 --> 00:30:49.265]  And he says that there were many, many explosions and said even when he had gotten out of the building at one in the afternoon, he was told that he had to get down, I think, 10 or 20 blocks and run because they were having reports of more explosions at the time.
[00:30:49.505 --> 00:30:50.346]  Now, let's be clear.
[00:30:52.532 --> 00:30:55.559]  All day they're announcing it's going to explode, it's going to fall, get back.
[00:30:55.679 --> 00:30:57.443]  We know they keep backing the time up for it.
[00:30:58.104 --> 00:31:02.394]  They finally do bring it down and we have cops saying get back, they're going to bring the building down, it's about to blow up.
[00:31:03.223 --> 00:31:06.666]  And they say, well, they just knew it was about to blow up, because they knew it was about to collapse.
[00:31:07.006 --> 00:31:10.369]  However, they say, get back, get back, it's about to blow, it's about to... It falls down.
[00:31:10.389 --> 00:31:12.370]  I mean, this is 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:31:13.131 --> 00:31:15.333]  Now we have Silverstein saying, pull the building.
[00:31:15.533 --> 00:31:16.714]  That means a controlled demolition.
[00:31:16.754 --> 00:31:18.235]  In their own documentary, they admit that.
[00:31:18.795 --> 00:31:19.696]  I mean, we've got them.
[00:31:19.736 --> 00:31:20.997]  This is unbelievable.
[00:31:21.177 --> 00:31:24.520]  They can ignore all these EMTs and police saying, get back, they're going to blow it.
[00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:25.441]  They can ignore...
[00:31:27.222 --> 00:31:30.066]  You know, all these eyewitnesses, even Amy Goodman, saying investigate it further.
[00:31:30.386 --> 00:31:33.570]  But they can't ignore their own deputy head of emergency management saying.
[00:31:33.991 --> 00:31:35.393]  That's right, and that's why they have to spin it.
[00:31:35.453 --> 00:31:41.581]  They have to put it in with other information, disinformation and misinformation, in order to try to distort his story.
[00:31:41.841 --> 00:31:42.743]  And to finish up here.
[00:31:44.741 --> 00:31:47.944]  We probably need to add that to the clip, that he's a fan of you guys seeing the film.
[00:31:48.204 --> 00:31:50.346]  So that adds the fact he's saying inside job.
[00:31:50.366 --> 00:31:52.008]  I mean, that's the overall what you got from him?
[00:31:52.308 --> 00:31:56.052]  Oh, when we were there, he was the boss of the department floor.
[00:31:56.072 --> 00:31:56.352]  Stay there.
[00:31:56.372 --> 00:31:57.133]  I want to hear more about this.
[00:31:57.153 --> 00:31:57.413]  Sure.
[00:31:57.453 --> 00:31:57.773]  Stay there.
[00:32:01.056 --> 00:32:02.458]  It is a big idea.
[00:32:03.539 --> 00:32:04.580]  A new world order.
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:05.961]  In the near future.
[00:32:07.111 --> 00:32:07.791]  They have to spin it.
[00:32:07.831 --> 00:32:13.973]  They have to put it in with other information, disinformation and misinformation in order to try to distort his story.
[00:32:14.213 --> 00:32:20.335]  And to finish up here... We probably need to add that to the clip that he's a fan of you guys seeing the film.
[00:32:20.595 --> 00:32:22.736]  So that adds the fact he's saying inside job.
[00:32:22.776 --> 00:32:24.397]  I mean, that's the overall what you got from him.
[00:32:24.697 --> 00:32:28.438]  Oh, when we were there, he was the boss of the department floor.
[00:32:28.458 --> 00:32:28.718]  Stay there.
[00:32:28.738 --> 00:32:29.518]  I want to hear more about this.
[00:32:29.538 --> 00:32:29.738]  Sure.
[00:32:29.758 --> 00:32:30.138]  Stay there.
[00:32:33.379 --> 00:32:34.700]  It is a big idea.
[00:32:35.814 --> 00:32:36.895]  A New World Order.
[00:32:37.595 --> 00:32:41.698]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:32:41.738 --> 00:32:44.659]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:47.581]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:32:48.101 --> 00:32:50.563]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:32:51.303 --> 00:32:58.608]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:33:01.627 --> 00:33:06.630]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:33:07.091 --> 00:33:10.573]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:33:10.953 --> 00:33:13.455]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:33:13.515 --> 00:33:14.676]  Most people have no idea.
[00:33:14.696 --> 00:33:15.456]  They're not after money.
[00:33:15.476 --> 00:33:16.537]  They have all the money they need.
[00:33:16.757 --> 00:33:17.458]  They're after power.
[00:33:17.738 --> 00:33:18.859]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[00:33:30.407 --> 00:33:31.047]  You have been
[00:33:32.964 --> 00:33:35.005]  The superfood for you and your family.
[00:33:35.405 --> 00:33:38.666]  Hemp has nutritional values that far exceed any known plant.
[00:33:39.146 --> 00:33:39.406]  Hemp.
[00:33:39.826 --> 00:33:42.587]  Used for food, clothing, and shelter since time began.
[00:33:42.927 --> 00:33:43.227]  Hemp.
[00:33:43.567 --> 00:33:50.029]  This God-given food source is controlled by your government, making it not legal to grow for American people and farmers, but legal to import.
[00:33:50.369 --> 00:33:53.630]  Our founding fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.
[00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:57.752]  The protein powder, seeds, and oil are available through hempusa.org.

[00:34:32.685 --> 00:34:35.607]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:34:35.767 --> 00:34:41.011]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:34:41.291 --> 00:34:46.635]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:34:47.015 --> 00:34:48.136]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:34:48.497 --> 00:34:57.383]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:34:57.803 --> 00:34:59.425]  Now, compare a Calvin Pierce soap.
[00:34:59.645 --> 00:35:05.530]  All natural, earth-friendly, no harsh chemicals, no... Big Brother.
[00:35:06.191 --> 00:35:07.252]  Mainstream media.
[00:35:07.952 --> 00:35:08.993]  Government cover-ups.
[00:35:09.714 --> 00:35:10.534]  You want answers?
[00:35:11.295 --> 00:35:12.216]  Well, so does he.
[00:35:12.236 --> 00:35:16.560]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:21.104]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:35:22.298 --> 00:35:35.634]  There is a reason that the Morning Joe on MSNBC, that Glenn Peck on CNN, that Bill O'Reilly, all of them are saying we need to be arrested, we need to be killed, we need to be taken to secret camps and tortured.
[00:35:35.915 --> 00:35:38.778]  Morning Joe, the military needs to be used against us.
[00:35:38.798 --> 00:35:40.721]  9-11 truth must die.
[00:35:41.673 --> 00:35:52.339]  And now Michael Reagan, ninth largest radio host in the country, according to Talkers Magazine and others, four million listeners per day, said, kill Mark Deiss, kill 9-11 truthers.
[00:35:52.399 --> 00:35:58.202]  If they talk to the military, if they engage in their First Amendment and expose 9-11 as an inside job, murder them.
[00:35:58.702 --> 00:36:00.683]  He has not been fired, he has not gotten in trouble.
[00:36:00.943 --> 00:36:05.085]  If any of us said, kill people, we would be arrested within hours.
[00:36:05.185 --> 00:36:09.648]  If we said, go out, kill them, I mean it, I'm serious, I'll pay for it, kill them, we'd be arrested.
[00:36:10.608 --> 00:36:14.850]  So, we know this is serious because, look, they understand they're protecting a system.
[00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:16.811]  Most of them know their boss has carried it out.
[00:36:17.111 --> 00:36:18.311]  That makes them even scarier.
[00:36:18.892 --> 00:36:20.672]  That's why Congress goes ahead and does what they're told.
[00:36:20.692 --> 00:36:22.593]  It's not just the payoffs and the money and the corruption.
[00:36:23.393 --> 00:36:24.734]  I mean, it's scary, folks.
[00:36:24.754 --> 00:36:26.455]  We're in a very scary time.
[00:36:27.855 --> 00:36:37.879]  Now, the deputy head of the Office of Emergency Management, Barry Jennings, came out with one of the other government heads that day and said, man, there were bombs, dead people, Building 7 was blowing up.
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:39.780]  This is before it even fell.
[00:36:40.819 --> 00:36:45.522]  And then we went and interviewed him, and then he got scared, he got threatened, the spooks found out, we talked to him.
[00:36:46.002 --> 00:36:48.664]  He said, please, I know you, I said you could use it, but don't.
[00:36:48.944 --> 00:36:51.246]  Then I guess they got to him and said, you better talk to the BBC.
[00:36:51.606 --> 00:36:55.669]  He did, and he said stuff like, well, I think there were, it looked like bodies.
[00:36:57.129 --> 00:36:57.970]  I guess it might not have been.
[00:36:58.030 --> 00:37:00.491]  I don't know why there were bombs and explosives going off.
[00:37:00.971 --> 00:37:09.115]  So they're going to try to spin that and they're going to try to make excuses, as I've debated the producer of it on another show a few months ago, about, well, we all knew Building 7 was coming down.
[00:37:09.155 --> 00:37:11.336]  That's why we reported it fell with it right behind us.
[00:37:12.497 --> 00:37:15.038]  Ignoring the cops saying, get back, they're bringing it down, they're going to blow it up.
[00:37:15.078 --> 00:37:16.038]  I mean, ignoring all this.
[00:37:16.259 --> 00:37:17.259]  We've got them, folks!
[00:37:17.739 --> 00:37:19.620]  People always say something this big, they'd be caught.
[00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:23.682]  We're going to go to Mark Dice in a moment, but the point is everybody can feel it, you can see it.
[00:37:24.362 --> 00:37:24.943]  I mean, we had
[00:37:26.785 --> 00:37:28.822]  So many people going public.
[00:37:29.992 --> 00:37:31.313]  So many people speaking out.
[00:37:31.433 --> 00:37:40.279]  German defense ministers, high-level members of the British Parliament, members of Blair's government, UN human rights chiefs over whole investigative arms.
[00:37:41.279 --> 00:37:47.303]  We've got former Italian presidents, former intelligence chiefs of Germany.
[00:37:47.823 --> 00:37:48.384]  All of this.
[00:37:48.804 --> 00:37:54.068]  Hollywood stars, best actress, Willie Nelson, Charlie Sheen, Martin Sheen.
[00:37:55.989 --> 00:37:58.170]  All these big rock stars have been going public.
[00:37:58.210 --> 00:37:59.251]  I mean, it's getting
[00:38:00.876 --> 00:38:05.880]  Every day now, you can't even keep track of everybody going public, and so they're getting scared and going, look, we'll kill you!
[00:38:06.521 --> 00:38:20.032]  And now, I've been sending a lot of YouTube videos and things, and you'll go to their websites, they'll be Marines or Army, usually Force Recon or Special Ops, they'll have their handle, and most of it's videos of them in training, and it'll be them saying,
[00:38:21.937 --> 00:38:25.819]  Stop now or we're going to kill your animals.
[00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:28.100]  I don't want to even give them attention.
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:32.042]  Or they'll use a South Park clip saying, we're going to kill a bunny on the bus.
[00:38:32.282 --> 00:38:33.363]  Do what I say, I'm going to kill the bunny.
[00:38:33.403 --> 00:38:34.243]  Stop now or you're dead.
[00:38:34.484 --> 00:38:38.246]  We're now getting all these videos and clips they use for movies about, one more time and you're dead.
[00:38:38.546 --> 00:38:41.107]  And they're sending it to 9-11 truthers.
[00:38:41.127 --> 00:38:46.790]  Or they'll say on their own message board, yeah I'm in the Marines and I can't wait to line you up and shoot you all in the head.
[00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:49.932]  And then you go and they're really in Iraq saying this to us.
[00:38:50.754 --> 00:38:52.214]  And so they're getting scared, folks.
[00:38:52.234 --> 00:38:53.895]  They know we're interfacing with the military.
[00:38:54.195 --> 00:38:55.535]  They know we're interfacing with the police.
[00:38:55.755 --> 00:38:57.496]  They know we're waking the majority of them up.
[00:38:58.136 --> 00:38:59.836]  The New Order needs these people to take over.
[00:39:01.077 --> 00:39:03.097]  They're getting real scared, so they're trying to intimidate us.
[00:39:03.157 --> 00:39:04.138]  And I got news, man.
[00:39:04.498 --> 00:39:05.458]  We're all committed.
[00:39:06.738 --> 00:39:13.380]  I mean, I don't want to die, but at the same time, I'm committed, and if they're forced to kill me, that means I'm really getting to them.
[00:39:14.735 --> 00:39:17.316]  I mean, that means that we're really winning.
[00:39:18.077 --> 00:39:19.397]  And that is a desperate act.
[00:39:19.437 --> 00:39:22.159]  First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win.
[00:39:22.499 --> 00:39:23.259]  As Gandhi said.
[00:39:23.619 --> 00:39:25.960]  So just in closing, Jason, this is huge.
[00:39:26.701 --> 00:39:28.622]  This isn't a cop or a firefighter on the street.
[00:39:29.762 --> 00:39:37.227]  Some EMT we've interviewed who's credible, who people ignore, who said, I heard the countdown, you watch footage of the cops going, get back, it's about to come down, they're about to blow it up!
[00:39:37.928 --> 00:39:51.037]  Or firefighters all, you know, a firefighting captain going, yeah, there was molten metal, you know, running down the channel rails, totally molten, and they say we're lying, there's no molten steel, when NASA's own aircraft show the molten steel thousands of degrees above jet fuel.
[00:39:52.418 --> 00:39:54.899]  The debunking isn't working, don't you understand?
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:56.841]  It's over for you terrorists!
[00:39:57.864 --> 00:40:05.987]  And I know your military mindset was, well, we've got to fight the Muslims, they're so evil, we killed 3,000 because Americans are wimps and had to get a wake-up call that it's for your own good.
[00:40:06.267 --> 00:40:08.207]  And if we have to kill more of you for your own good, we will.
[00:40:09.608 --> 00:40:12.309]  That's the ultimate rationale.
[00:40:12.369 --> 00:40:14.489]  Don't you have the feeling we've got the momentum?
[00:40:14.509 --> 00:40:17.791]  Don't you in your gut know we're going to bring you to justice?
[00:40:17.831 --> 00:40:19.591]  I mean, aren't you figuring that out yet?
[00:40:20.471 --> 00:40:22.752]  That we're not going to stop and you can kill us, threaten us?
[00:40:23.172 --> 00:40:24.973]  I mean, you think threatening my children
[00:40:28.556 --> 00:40:29.956]  Literally, folks, I was getting burned out.
[00:40:29.996 --> 00:40:30.876]  I was getting exhausted.
[00:40:30.896 --> 00:40:31.677]  I was getting tired.
[00:40:32.077 --> 00:40:42.258]  I was getting to where you guys saw me around the office, you know, just fighting to be able to continue staying focused because I had so much going on in my mind and so much I want to do and so much frustration and so much little minutiae I've got to deal with.
[00:40:43.098 --> 00:40:43.959]  And it threatened my family.
[00:40:43.979 --> 00:40:44.499]  It's like, boom!
[00:40:44.579 --> 00:40:45.879]  Now I suddenly don't have to sleep.
[00:40:45.959 --> 00:40:48.619]  I suddenly am just back in total mode.
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:50.060]  You guys have helped me.
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.540]  I already knew you did it.
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:56.081]  I already knew you're murderers and drug dealers and criminals and child sex slave traffickers.
[00:40:56.101 --> 00:40:57.521]  I mean, it's all admitted mainstream news.
[00:40:59.076 --> 00:41:05.459]  But to have you personally threatening me over and over again and threatening others, it lets me know that you really are who we say you are.
[00:41:05.499 --> 00:41:06.519]  You really are a terrorist.
[00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:08.220]  Burmas, anything else you want to add?
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:10.081]  I just want people to get this story out.
[00:41:10.121 --> 00:41:19.765]  It is very important that we have somebody who can have his story corroborated from video of that day, and there is no doubt that he was in Building 7 experiencing these explosions.
[00:41:20.145 --> 00:41:22.627]  It can totally take down the official version of this.
[00:41:23.547 --> 00:41:24.048]  We're good to go.
[00:41:38.849 --> 00:41:42.410]  Absolutely, and why wouldn't Michael Hess return my calls or faxes or emails?
[00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:47.792]  I tried to get Michael Hess before I even knew who Barry Jennings was, because I had his name from the news station.
[00:41:48.152 --> 00:41:50.012]  But of course, Michael Hess didn't want to go on camera.
[00:41:50.052 --> 00:41:51.153]  Anything else you want to add before we go?
[00:41:51.333 --> 00:41:51.933]  No, that's all.
[00:41:52.253 --> 00:41:52.973]  That's all I have to say.
[00:41:53.013 --> 00:41:53.634]  Thank you very much.
[00:41:54.974 --> 00:41:56.475]  It's important that people grab this video.
[00:41:56.515 --> 00:41:59.237]  We're going to upload it the next hour to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:41:59.257 --> 00:42:00.258]  We don't have the personnel.
[00:42:00.278 --> 00:42:00.878]  We need your help.
[00:42:01.198 --> 00:42:01.478]  Get it.
[00:42:01.538 --> 00:42:04.761]  Cut out the best pieces of the last 30 minutes with me and Burmess.
[00:42:04.801 --> 00:42:05.801]  Don't count on one guy to do it.
[00:42:05.841 --> 00:42:06.622]  Do different versions.
[00:42:06.662 --> 00:42:07.643]  I love how listeners do that.
[00:42:08.003 --> 00:42:08.623]  Send them to us.
[00:42:08.703 --> 00:42:09.344]  We'll post them.
[00:42:09.364 --> 00:42:10.244]  We'll magnify them.
[00:42:10.544 --> 00:42:11.885]  Our listeners will get them out later.
[00:42:12.025 --> 00:42:13.607]  Aaron was here until 5 in the morning with Burmess.
[00:42:13.927 --> 00:42:14.587]  He's asleep.
[00:42:14.907 --> 00:42:21.512]  He's going to come in and try to edit some of this video we've just shot here live into the Barry Jennings piece to really let you know how important it is.
[00:42:21.772 --> 00:42:25.054]  There's a video up there right now where Burmess gives the basic facts and then plays it.
[00:42:25.094 --> 00:42:25.614]  It's decent.
[00:42:25.874 --> 00:42:28.596]  It's just I really want to explain why this is so important.
[00:42:28.616 --> 00:42:31.998]  People won't know how important this is unless we explain all those facts.
[00:42:32.418 --> 00:42:34.099]  See, Burmess, we get too close to it.
[00:42:34.319 --> 00:42:42.404]  We're so inside the game and all the names and the facts and the data, we forget that even kind of passive 9-11 truth, a lot of this is Greek to them.
[00:42:42.904 --> 00:42:47.926]  I mean, just a few months ago, we couldn't say who Barry Jennings was, and the debunkers were saying we were lying and it didn't exist.
[00:42:48.466 --> 00:42:51.667]  And I can't believe the BBC thinks going to him and trying to twist what he says.
[00:42:52.267 --> 00:42:54.407]  And what I've been told is he repeats the same thing.
[00:42:54.868 --> 00:42:56.348]  He just kind of says, well, it looked like bodies.
[00:42:56.368 --> 00:42:57.448]  Well, I thought it was bodies.
[00:42:57.488 --> 00:42:59.069]  Well, I thought it was explosions.
[00:42:59.129 --> 00:43:02.810]  Well, they did tell me to get out, but that's because we knew seven, I guess, was going to come down.
[00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:04.150]  Well, why did you know that, see?
[00:43:04.951 --> 00:43:05.911]  But, I mean, let's be clear.
[00:43:06.914 --> 00:43:08.414]  We went to break and you forgot to say.
[00:43:08.654 --> 00:43:10.655]  You told me privately in other discussions off camera.
[00:43:10.675 --> 00:43:11.555]  He's like, oh hell yeah.
[00:43:11.835 --> 00:43:13.416]  I mean, how far did he go saying insults?
[00:43:13.496 --> 00:43:14.336]  Extremely far.
[00:43:14.696 --> 00:43:16.236]  He didn't even know who we were.
[00:43:16.296 --> 00:43:19.237]  We don't tell people who we are when we go to interview them.
[00:43:19.257 --> 00:43:22.098]  We say, look, we're interviewing for a new documentary.
[00:43:22.118 --> 00:43:22.978]  Would you like to be a part of it?
[00:43:22.998 --> 00:43:23.578]  And he said that.
[00:43:23.878 --> 00:43:26.799]  And while we were sitting there, he said, you know, I was in one of these documentaries.
[00:43:27.179 --> 00:43:29.640]  And kind of playing, you know, coy, knowing he was in ours.
[00:43:30.061 --> 00:43:30.841]  I said, oh really?
[00:43:30.861 --> 00:43:31.221]  Which one?
[00:43:31.241 --> 00:43:33.202]  And he said, uh, the Michael Myers one?
[00:43:33.242 --> 00:43:34.543]  I go, Michael Moore, Fahrenheit 9-11?
[00:43:34.623 --> 00:43:35.943]  He's like, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:43:36.164 --> 00:43:37.324]  He's like the conspiracy one.
[00:43:37.644 --> 00:43:38.645]  And I go, Loose Change?
[00:43:38.805 --> 00:43:40.346]  And he's like, yeah, I love that movie.
[00:43:40.386 --> 00:43:41.666]  He had a copy in the office.
[00:43:42.007 --> 00:43:43.627]  He had been showing other co-workers.
[00:43:43.707 --> 00:43:46.789]  And it was at that point that Dylan and I said, yeah, that's our film.
[00:43:47.269 --> 00:43:48.610]  And we're making a new one right now.
[00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:50.051]  And he was like, oh, that was you guys?
[00:43:50.171 --> 00:43:51.251]  That's a great movie.
[00:43:51.811 --> 00:43:53.272]  And I play it here all the time.
[00:43:53.292 --> 00:43:56.734]  And then he started pulling in other workers to introduce them to us.
[00:43:56.994 --> 00:43:58.196]  All right, this is key info.
[00:43:58.736 --> 00:43:59.317]  Let's be clear.
[00:43:59.337 --> 00:44:00.598]  So you'd say he was a 9-11 truther?
[00:44:00.759 --> 00:44:01.199]  Absolutely.
[00:44:01.339 --> 00:44:02.160]  He knew exactly what it was.
[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:04.503]  And the other co-workers were coming in going, this is the guy!
[00:44:04.904 --> 00:44:11.772]  Yeah, he was like, these are the guys that did loose change, and everybody it seemed in the office had seen it.
[00:44:11.792 --> 00:44:15.337]  Not everybody agreed with us, but everybody who came in shook our hands for sure.
[00:44:16.588 --> 00:44:22.532]  Now let's be clear, the guys that were running the Emergency Command Bunker, he's now the head of it at that time.
[00:44:22.952 --> 00:44:26.295]  I can't say which division he was in, but he's the head of a division.
[00:44:26.655 --> 00:44:32.279]  Yes, and the Office of Emergency Management is really a hub for all these different borough divisions, and he was one of those.
[00:44:32.359 --> 00:44:33.299]  Exactly, he was a chief.
[00:44:33.619 --> 00:44:35.741]  He was the head of the floor, for sure.
[00:44:36.301 --> 00:44:36.742]  For sure.
[00:44:37.102 --> 00:44:42.385]  So, you know, he had his own little TV and DVD player in the office, and he was sharing 9-11 truth with his co-workers.
[00:44:42.726 --> 00:44:45.788]  But then, after he got the heat, just when it leaked,
[00:44:46.968 --> 00:44:52.650]  That this went on, now he's trying to, well from what I've been told, he's not completely backing away.
[00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:53.890]  No, he's not backing away.
[00:44:54.250 --> 00:44:55.911]  He's a year closer to retirement.
[00:44:55.931 --> 00:44:59.032]  When we talked to him, he was two years away from retirement.
[00:44:59.052 --> 00:45:01.993]  I really feel like he wanted to make sure he had his pension for his kids.
[00:45:02.013 --> 00:45:02.973]  He was a family man.
[00:45:03.533 --> 00:45:04.954]  And he was very, very worried.
[00:45:04.974 --> 00:45:08.815]  We literally sat in his office for two hours to get the okay that we could do this interview.
[00:45:09.295 --> 00:45:12.879]  So that's why we've never said exactly where he worked or for what department.
[00:45:13.299 --> 00:45:18.965]  Because he then, after we leaked this, they were threatening to fire him and take away his pension.
[00:45:19.205 --> 00:45:20.606]  And that would be the last thing I would like to do.
[00:45:20.626 --> 00:45:21.847]  But we're not going to let them do that.
[00:45:22.028 --> 00:45:22.168]  No.
[00:45:22.548 --> 00:45:25.451]  And the point is, he did the BBC, so we're forced to do this.
[00:45:25.811 --> 00:45:30.035]  Because, again, I want to repeat the key, and we're going to go to Mark Dice here, I want to repeat the key to all of this.
[00:45:31.095 --> 00:45:43.360]  That is that Dylan sitting there with the BBC, the same Guy Smith guy that laughs at me and basically admitted to me it was a hit piece in private and said he thinks I'm nuts, who said it wasn't a hit piece up front, kind of disingenuously.
[00:45:44.581 --> 00:45:47.842]  This same guy went and said, well it's a lie, Barry Jennings didn't say that.
[00:45:48.303 --> 00:45:49.603]  It's not true, you don't have video.
[00:45:49.903 --> 00:45:53.545]  And Dylan pulls the video out and I bet my bottom dollar that is not going to be in the film.
[00:45:53.565 --> 00:45:57.046]  No, I guarantee that's not going to be in the film and that's another reason why we had to put this stuff out.
[00:45:58.507 --> 00:46:01.049]  They may pull it now and delay it, like they did the History Channel piece.
[00:46:01.349 --> 00:46:04.992]  We made them delay that release by two weeks, because they went and pulled stuff out.
[00:46:05.292 --> 00:46:12.998]  Because we expose them, so we're preemptively countering the BBC propaganda ministry of truth right now.
[00:46:13.298 --> 00:46:15.179]  Absolutely, and that's another reason to put it out.
[00:46:15.219 --> 00:46:21.384]  It was going to be in Fabled Enemies anyway, but why not put it out two weeks before their hit piece to show what liars and hypocrites they are?
[00:46:21.824 --> 00:46:22.225]  Absolutely.
[00:46:22.245 --> 00:46:25.151]  Let's go to Mark Dice and we'll hold him over to the next segment after that.
[00:46:25.773 --> 00:46:27.737]  Then I've got some financial news coming up and a lot more.
[00:46:28.739 --> 00:46:30.222]  Mark Dice, what do you think of what you just heard?
[00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:33.510]  Oh, it's just the evidence keeps coming.
[00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:35.091]  We've got to continue to get the word out.
[00:46:35.211 --> 00:46:41.914]  And, you know, like you said, we're at the third stage of the four stages of a fight, and they're attacking us now.
[00:46:41.954 --> 00:46:46.317]  We're getting closer to victory, so let's just continue it, and we'll pick this up on the other side.
[00:46:46.337 --> 00:46:55.721]  Well, Mark Dice, for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, I'm going to continue a four-minute discussion with you and Burmese, and we'll come back with you alone on the main radio network transmission here at Genesis.
[00:46:55.761 --> 00:46:57.262]  Everybody else, go to the InfoWars streams.
[00:46:57.282 --> 00:46:58.443]  You'll be able to hear this right now.
[00:47:00.495 --> 00:47:03.297]  Okay, bring me Mark Dice.
[00:47:04.038 --> 00:47:06.200]  Okay, great.
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:10.863]  Yeah, Mark, I don't want to waste any time here, so let's write now for four minutes with you and Jason.
[00:47:11.724 --> 00:47:16.428]  I mean, give us your take on this subject now, then we'll come back and talk about the Reagan stuff.
[00:47:16.908 --> 00:47:17.749]  What do you think about this?
[00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:20.831]  Well, it's not surprising.
[00:47:21.332 --> 00:47:28.658]  It's very encouraging that somebody would come forward, and again, we can't fault the man for not wanting to lose his pension and lose his job.
[00:47:28.678 --> 00:47:29.779]  He's got a family to support.
[00:47:30.885 --> 00:47:38.627]  We need to just create this climate that's safe for everybody to get this information out, which is part of what I wanted to do with Operation Inform the Soldiers.
[00:47:38.687 --> 00:47:44.109]  And so the more people that we get out there, the more people that get to address these issues, the safer it will be.
[00:47:44.269 --> 00:47:58.173]  And that's why people say, exactly, people say, oh, it doesn't matter if Willie Nelson or Charlie Sheen or Martin Sheen are Best Actress of the Year or German Defense Ministers or former Italian Presidents or high-level members of the Japanese Congress, Diet.
[00:48:01.895 --> 00:48:08.020]  Yeah, just a few years ago.
[00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:14.684]  I mean, we would address these issues to our friends and to our neighbors at a whisper, just afraid of any retribution, even from them.
[00:48:14.744 --> 00:48:21.809]  And so it's gotten from that point now to where most of these talking heads have to admit that a third of the country is on board with us.
[00:48:21.849 --> 00:48:25.452]  And if we just continue to plow forward, continue to get this information out,
[00:48:26.098 --> 00:48:37.735]  Non-stop, we're going to get other people to continue to come forward, witnesses, other high-level, key public officials, other professionals, other experts, and so we're not going to stop.
[00:48:37.796 --> 00:48:42.102]  And this loser, Michael Reagan, just energized the movement and galvanized it.
[00:48:42.162 --> 00:48:51.571]  We're going to talk about that when we get back from break, but in the two minutes that we've got here before we come back, I mean, I really am not putting a good face on it, being a cheerleader.
[00:48:52.132 --> 00:49:00.140]  I know we're waking people up, and Mark Dyche, you used that two-and-a-half-year-old number of 36% believing it's a total inside job.
[00:49:03.383 --> 00:49:06.504]  national poll that they put out.
[00:49:06.624 --> 00:49:16.567]  We know from studying polls that if you ask somebody a really radical, shocking question, about half of them will lie and go with the politically correct answer.
[00:49:16.887 --> 00:49:23.109]  So 36% got the Scripps Howard News Service call and said, do you believe the government carried out the attacks?
[00:49:23.209 --> 00:49:26.470]  And 36% or more than a third said, yes I do.
[00:49:26.490 --> 00:49:26.711]  It was like 36.7%.
[00:49:29.152 --> 00:49:34.795]  But even the polling companies, and I've talked to Zogby and others, and they agree with my analysis, it's probably double that number.
[00:49:35.055 --> 00:49:38.537]  It's just another 30-40% weren't willing to say it.
[00:49:38.617 --> 00:49:53.785]  Now, when they've had these spontaneous one-time IP polls, it's always 82-83-84, 82-83-84, on CNN, Fox, every channel has these, and these are somewhat scientific compared to classical polls because you only get one vote per IP.
[00:49:54.545 --> 00:49:58.429]  You know, one only lets you vote once, and you keep getting that 80-plus number.
[00:49:59.210 --> 00:49:59.630]  Okay?
[00:50:00.291 --> 00:50:04.436]  And we get that 80-plus number in Kennedy assassination, that 80-plus number on the war.
[00:50:04.456 --> 00:50:08.440]  80-plus percent of the country doesn't believe a damn thing the government says.
[00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:12.844]  And so I think when we use that 36 number, that is the most conservative.
[00:50:13.946 --> 00:50:14.927]  Burmish, you want to comment on that?
[00:50:15.393 --> 00:50:27.779]  Yeah, I feel like one third of the country is very aware that 9-11 was an inside job, and this is the third of the country that's actually paying attention, Alex.
[00:50:27.799 --> 00:50:37.223]  This is the one that kind of goes through the mainstream media on a daily basis, but also comes to Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and all these other alternative websites.
[00:50:38.504 --> 00:50:41.466]  Within the youth, I would say it's probably even double that for sure.
[00:50:41.506 --> 00:50:47.311]  If they were to take a poll of people 25 and under, I think that you would see 60 to 70 percent.
[00:50:47.451 --> 00:50:55.396]  Listen, I'll be at the gym around, you know, old guys, you know, executives or whatever, and they'll go, hey, Alex Jones, and I'll go, and it'll be both guys on both sides of me.
[00:50:55.416 --> 00:50:56.577]  I go, what do you think of the show?
[00:50:56.958 --> 00:50:58.999]  You're probably right about it, but what are we going to do?
[00:50:59.019 --> 00:50:59.660]  And I'm like, what about 9-11?
[00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:01.401]  And he goes, oh, hell, I was in
[00:51:01.821 --> 00:51:03.082]  Special Forces in Korea.
[00:51:03.102 --> 00:51:04.082]  Don't have to tell me about it.
[00:51:04.362 --> 00:51:07.984]  I mean, I was at the beach and old men were down there in the exercise area and they were agreeing.
[00:51:08.304 --> 00:51:10.405]  I mean, it just seems like everybody... Oh, we're going back live.
[00:51:10.425 --> 00:51:10.745]  Here we go.
[00:51:13.126 --> 00:51:18.049]  Planes, they that build all the bombs.
[00:51:18.069 --> 00:51:22.931]  They that hide behind walls.
[00:51:24.852 --> 00:51:26.733]  They that hide behind desks.
[00:51:29.279 --> 00:51:34.903]  Okay, going to Mark Dice to talk about what's happening with him and Michael Reagan.
[00:51:34.923 --> 00:51:40.866]  For those that don't know, Mike Reagan said, go out, kill him, murder him, I'll pay for it.
[00:51:41.347 --> 00:51:46.650]  Kill the other 9-11 truthers, anybody that talks to the troops, anybody that educates them about it being an inside job.
[00:51:48.631 --> 00:51:51.333]  And we got Mark Dice on with us.
[00:51:51.773 --> 00:51:52.554]  Now, here's the deal.
[00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:54.611]  It's clearly fair use.
[00:51:54.792 --> 00:51:55.853]  Mark's commenting on it.
[00:51:56.213 --> 00:51:57.715]  They took down a bunch of our videos.
[00:51:57.735 --> 00:52:00.198]  They took down dozens of other videos we know of.
[00:52:01.408 --> 00:52:03.470]  Where we play a short clip and comment on it.
[00:52:04.310 --> 00:52:12.437]  They even took down videos that were criticizing Mark Dice, I mean, that were criticizing Michael Reagan, that didn't even have Michael Reagan on it.
[00:52:12.718 --> 00:52:18.362]  They've been pulling clips of him saying, put hand grenades in babies' rectums and murder them, kill the Muslim babies.
[00:52:20.364 --> 00:52:21.905]  I mean, they are something else.
[00:52:22.166 --> 00:52:26.950]  And is your YouTube account still shut down, Mark Dice?
[00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:29.890]  The entire YouTube account is shut down.
[00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:31.651]  All videos have been pulled.
[00:52:31.731 --> 00:52:37.332]  I filed a counter... By the way, you had millions of views on your videos.
[00:52:37.432 --> 00:52:48.915]  Yeah, over 60 videos, a three-year-old account almost, and just numerous links, hundreds of links to those videos, and the entire account has been closed.
[00:52:48.975 --> 00:52:55.536]  I filed a counter suit with YouTube, trying to get it back up, trying to make them understand that this is just a
[00:52:56.275 --> 00:52:57.676]  A fair use claim?
[00:52:57.696 --> 00:52:58.937]  You mean countersuit?
[00:52:59.678 --> 00:53:04.722]  Or a counterclaim, rather, to attempt to reinstate the account.
[00:53:04.802 --> 00:53:06.944]  So that's in the works right now.
[00:53:06.964 --> 00:53:12.488]  I just got word, too, that Michael Reagan is officially above the law.
[00:53:12.949 --> 00:53:13.369]  The U.S.
[00:53:13.409 --> 00:53:21.836]  Attorney's Office will not be pressing charges against him for his comments and any other future
[00:53:22.412 --> 00:53:22.913]  I don't think so.
[00:53:30.655 --> 00:53:33.597]  Has officially been let off the hook and still has a job.
[00:53:33.658 --> 00:53:36.320]  Now, this sets a precedent, but don't believe that for a minute.
[00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:46.668]  If I go on air and even say hypothetically, and I'm not saying do this hypothetically, if I said, go kill Michael Reagan, I'll pay for the bullets, hell, the cops may edit that and come arrest me right now.
[00:53:47.489 --> 00:53:48.710]  I would go to prison immediately.
[00:53:48.730 --> 00:53:50.311]  They'd probably kill me in the SWAT team, right?
[00:53:50.331 --> 00:53:51.932]  They use any excuse to come kill you nowadays.
[00:53:52.713 --> 00:53:53.333]  That's how it works.
[00:53:53.373 --> 00:54:00.059]  Not only that, but his listeners would then call for violence against you and for others, and it just goes to show the state of our hearts, the state of the
[00:54:01.601 --> 00:54:13.173]  We don't want any violence against him until we take the republic back and then they all get due process.
[00:54:13.453 --> 00:54:15.736]  We know he went to the White House, got propaganda points.
[00:54:16.136 --> 00:54:16.857]  That's illegal.
[00:54:16.897 --> 00:54:18.098]  We know he's on their payroll.
[00:54:18.258 --> 00:54:22.283]  Then he will be brought to justice in a Nuremberg-style trial.
[00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:39.862]  It's interesting, the president of his radio syndicator, Radio America, his name is Jim Roberts, he's also the president of the American Veterans Center, and the American Veterans Center and Radio America's headquarters is literally five miles away from the White House, across the river.
[00:54:39.942 --> 00:54:42.784]  Oh yeah, it's a completely government run, that's come out, yeah.
[00:54:43.585 --> 00:54:45.346]  Oliver Norris involved, it's a huge, yeah.
[00:54:46.550 --> 00:54:48.010]  Yeah, they're protecting Reagan.
[00:54:48.070 --> 00:54:49.150]  He still has a job.
[00:54:49.351 --> 00:54:51.351]  Who knows what will happen with the FCC.
[00:54:51.391 --> 00:54:56.552]  There is a petition now on my site to get Michael Reagan removed from the school board, I believe.
[00:54:57.032 --> 00:55:02.753]  He's on the school board of his Notre Dame High School, where his kids go in Sherman Oaks, California.
[00:55:02.893 --> 00:55:04.653]  As he says, murder babies.
[00:55:05.633 --> 00:55:05.893]  Yeah.
[00:55:05.933 --> 00:55:08.874]  Stick hand grenades in babies' rectums and murder them.
[00:55:09.654 --> 00:55:13.935]  Yeah, and this is a man that's on a school board, so we're trying to get him removed from the board.
[00:55:14.645 --> 00:55:17.687]  Maybe we can give out the number to the American Veterans Center.
[00:55:17.707 --> 00:55:23.031]  This is the center that's in charge of the United States Memorial Day Parade in Washington, D.C.
[00:55:23.071 --> 00:55:34.838]  It's a very large, very powerful veterans group, and this president, Jim Roberts, is also the head of this syndication company, and they're taking no action against Reagan for his comments.
[00:55:34.978 --> 00:55:35.999]  Yeah, give the number out.
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:39.561]  The number for the American Veterans Center is 703-
[00:55:43.114 --> 00:56:04.131]  302-1012 or you could go to AmericanVeteransCenter.org and if we can't get a hold of him or his studio at Reagan at Radio America is not responding then maybe we can get through to the American Veterans Center and reach Mr. Jim Roberts over there again.
[00:56:04.732 --> 00:56:05.372]  That number is 703-302-1012.
[00:56:11.121 --> 00:56:15.326]  Well, Mark Dice, here's the deal.
[00:56:15.466 --> 00:56:26.020]  As you know, in Germany, from 33 to about 40, they would let the SA, the SS beat up whoever they wanted, rob whoever they wanted, harass, and it all started like this.
[00:56:27.162 --> 00:56:30.845]  And just thank God we've got our Second Amendment to protect ourselves.
[00:56:31.665 --> 00:56:35.288]  And I just feel sorry for anybody that tries anything violent with you or me or anybody else.
[00:56:35.868 --> 00:56:42.412]  Because folks, we're not looking for a fight, but you, anybody lays a hand on me, I'm going to kill you so fast, it's going to make your head spin.
[00:56:42.833 --> 00:56:43.413]  I'm armed.
[00:56:43.753 --> 00:56:44.834]  I will defend myself.
[00:56:45.174 --> 00:56:45.895]  We'll be right back.
[00:56:45.935 --> 00:56:46.375]  Stay with us.
[00:56:46.395 --> 00:56:47.696]  I want to talk to you during the break.
[00:56:50.918 --> 00:56:53.880]  Okay, Mark, I wanted to bring Burmese in during this segment again.
[00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:55.822]  Burmese, anything else you want to add to all this?
[00:56:56.687 --> 00:56:59.308]  Well, I just want to let people know that we can't let this stand.
[00:56:59.328 --> 00:57:00.409]  We need to spread this story.
[00:57:00.449 --> 00:57:04.110]  We need to email, and we need to make Operation Inform the Troops that much stronger.
[00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:06.211]  You know, you make those care packages fun.
[00:57:06.251 --> 00:57:07.792]  You put in some good food.
[00:57:07.832 --> 00:57:12.494]  If you are lucky enough to be able to afford a DVD player, maybe you put that in there with a copy of Terraform.
[00:57:12.534 --> 00:57:13.474]  Hell, they're like 30 bucks now.
[00:57:13.494 --> 00:57:15.495]  Yeah, they're like 30 or 40 dollars, and you can get one
[00:57:16.295 --> 00:57:18.417]  That's 30 or 40 bucks that plays DivX.
[00:57:18.437 --> 00:57:29.868]  By the way, we're going to put a DivX version of Truth Rising for PrisonPlanet.tv members and it's made, and most of the new players are DivX, they'll play both kinds, and so this is a huge activist tool.
[00:57:29.888 --> 00:57:33.191]  We're going to do that, a DivX version for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:57:33.271 --> 00:57:41.095]  Yeah, and you can literally put four movies on a 4.7 gigabyte disc that'll play in DVD quality no problem on these players and that's what we need to do.
[00:57:41.115 --> 00:57:42.416]  We need to keep informing the troops.
[00:57:42.436 --> 00:57:47.999]  We need to keep giving them more and more information so when they come back here they're not all jack-booted up to shoot me in the nuts.
[00:57:48.019 --> 00:57:49.600]  And by the way, the fries are a best buy.
[00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:54.562]  You can even buy for like 50 bucks an imprinter that on blank DVDs will put the label you want.
[00:57:54.822 --> 00:57:56.843]  Put something in there like
[00:57:58.104 --> 00:58:03.769]  George Bush Memorial Church Gathering, or put a name on it like... Or Spider-Man 3.
[00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:04.650]  Spider-Man 3.
[00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:10.595]  Just info, attack the New World Order, the savage globalists destroying our country and using our troops to do it.
[00:58:10.735 --> 00:58:12.677]  Fight these modern Hitlers.
[00:58:12.957 --> 00:58:14.939]  We are not like the Germans who went along with it.
[00:58:14.999 --> 00:58:16.981]  We are going to fight the whole way.
[00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:20.061]  Absolutely, and I'm not going to back down.
[00:58:20.101 --> 00:58:24.443]  It doesn't matter how many of these threats I get by all these disgusting talk shows.
[00:58:24.463 --> 00:58:36.468]  When you're literally advocating not only the death of babies, but the murders of their mothers as well, and that the only way that the Middle East is ever going to become peaceful is if we kill all of them.
[00:58:36.548 --> 00:58:37.929]  This man is calling for genocide.
[00:58:38.069 --> 00:58:40.291]  And by the way, he's on the Armed Forces Radio Network.
[00:58:40.691 --> 00:58:57.562]  They then sit off the road, these young 18-year-olds, totally whacked out of their minds, and the family drives by in a minivan, and they just shoot them, and they fall out dying with their children, and they laugh, and then the military admits these are real videos, and Marines post on the pages and say, yeah, they're real, and we're going to take over and kill you, Alex Jones!
[00:58:57.662 --> 00:58:58.883]  Well, there's no doubt that they're real.
[00:58:58.903 --> 00:59:02.485]  And you bet we're killing dogs, and you bet we're killing people's cows, and we're going to kill you!
[00:59:02.806 --> 00:59:04.507]  And they're coming back to be cops, folks!
[00:59:04.747 --> 00:59:07.729]  I've got an article right here, the military secret weapon,
[00:59:08.589 --> 00:59:09.790]  And it shows Prozac.
[00:59:09.850 --> 00:59:12.411]  Do you know what causes psychotic breaks and psychotic killing?
[00:59:13.052 --> 00:59:18.435]  That's your cops, murdering killers from Iraq on a drug that makes them psychopathically killed.
[00:59:18.455 --> 00:59:18.675]  Go ahead.
[00:59:18.895 --> 00:59:23.538]  Yeah, when I saw the video that you were just talking about of the car deaths, I was just shocked.
[00:59:23.578 --> 00:59:24.798]  And what it is is... The video?
[00:59:24.818 --> 00:59:25.319]  There's hundreds.
[00:59:25.359 --> 00:59:29.241]  Well, I'm just talking about the one where the rock and roll is playing in the background.
[00:59:29.261 --> 00:59:29.621]  Elvis Jim.
[00:59:29.781 --> 00:59:33.026]  Yeah, there's about four people in the car and they just start letting off machines.
[00:59:33.046 --> 00:59:34.167]  Well, they kill three carloads.
[00:59:34.227 --> 00:59:39.655]  Yes, and the last carload would have no idea that's even being shot at till it's too late.
[00:59:40.116 --> 00:59:45.924]  They're going down a main by Baghdad Highway, it's contractors, and they're just randomly shooting cars and laughing.
[00:59:46.145 --> 00:59:46.285]  Yeah.
[00:59:46.465 --> 00:59:50.668]  And there's other videos that are sitting off the road of a highway, families driving by, shooting women.
[00:59:50.688 --> 00:59:52.449]  I mean, they're all coming here to rule.
[00:59:52.509 --> 00:59:53.089]  You understand?
[00:59:53.290 --> 00:59:54.210]  They bring in the drugs.
[00:59:54.250 --> 00:59:55.231]  They run the narcotics.
[00:59:55.411 --> 00:59:56.912]  They run the child kidnapping rings.
[00:59:57.072 --> 00:59:58.453]  They plant the bombs in the buildings.
[00:59:58.673 --> 00:59:59.694]  They dominate.
[00:59:59.934 --> 01:00:01.095]  They pose as conservatives.
[01:00:01.115 --> 01:00:05.758]  They wrap themselves in the flag as they destroy the borders, as they come after your Second Amendment.
[01:00:06.018 --> 01:00:06.919]  I'm just sick of them!
[01:00:07.719 --> 01:00:08.300]  We've got to go live.
[01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:09.180]  Here we go with Mark Dice.
[01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:10.081]  Thank you, Burmess.
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:20.622]  Okay, I'm going to get into some financial news in about five minutes.
[01:00:20.662 --> 01:00:22.523]  I appreciate Mark Dice popping in with us.
[01:00:22.944 --> 01:00:23.844]  Mark, you've got the floor.
[01:00:23.865 --> 01:00:27.467]  I just want to say you did a great job with that Michael Reagan interview.
[01:00:28.048 --> 01:00:35.734]  It sounded to me from the YouTube clip like they'd edited some of your interview that you did with him in a taped interview, but they did air that, thank God.
[01:00:35.754 --> 01:00:37.736]  And you did a great job there.
[01:00:38.076 --> 01:00:40.438]  We need to see Operation Inform the Troops intensify.
[01:00:40.658 --> 01:00:41.719]  You've got the floor, Mark Dice.
[01:00:42.898 --> 01:00:44.119]  Yeah, it was interesting.
[01:00:44.319 --> 01:00:52.864]  They did edit out one part where I informed his listeners that it was a pre-recorded show that was 8.30 in the morning my time, and I wanted everybody to know it was a pre-recorded show.
[01:00:52.904 --> 01:00:56.946]  I took precautions to ensure that they wouldn't edit out any important information.
[01:00:58.047 --> 01:01:01.609]  Also, yeah, I don't want this to overshadow Operation Inform the Soldiers.
[01:01:01.669 --> 01:01:08.193]  Another aspect, what we can do is send them CDs of the Alex Jones Show and other shows, other broadcasts,
[01:01:08.638 --> 01:01:18.422]  Send them CDs on MP3 or even burn a CD as a WAV file so they can listen to it in their Discman or give them some flash drives or some MP3s.
[01:01:18.562 --> 01:01:20.023]  Yeah, thumb drives are great.
[01:01:20.083 --> 01:01:21.023]  Thumb drives are great.
[01:01:21.964 --> 01:01:25.225]  They can put it on their MP3 player or their iPod and listen to it.
[01:01:25.645 --> 01:01:29.587]  Also, you can... Markham, Markham, Markham Family Videos or stuff like that.
[01:01:30.515 --> 01:01:33.740]  Yeah, pictures from home, photos from home, something like that.
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:38.527]  Again, they're trying to make sure that no material is going to reach the troops.
[01:01:38.627 --> 01:01:39.969]  But don't think that'll stop us.
[01:01:40.069 --> 01:01:42.953]  We need to hit the bases and everywhere wherever we live.
[01:01:43.955 --> 01:01:45.657]  We need to go in and get the info in there.
[01:01:46.451 --> 01:01:55.661]  Yeah, another aspect, not only just sending it overseas, but here at Camp Pendleton, California, other military bases around the country to the soldiers before they even go over there.
[01:01:56.101 --> 01:02:08.935]  So they can spread the word amongst their own groups and amongst their peers and their commanding officers over here so that they know what's going on and that once the higher-ups know, that everybody knows, their whole system's just going to come collapsing down.
[01:02:09.414 --> 01:02:13.576]  That's right, and we've got one of the deputy heads of emergency management coming out saying inside job.
[01:02:13.596 --> 01:02:15.877]  And that's for the first time ever.
[01:02:15.917 --> 01:02:17.378]  Burma's telling you about him in private.
[01:02:17.578 --> 01:02:21.320]  I'd already been told the story a year ago and could never tell it on air.
[01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:23.941]  Had to be called a liar and say none of it existed.
[01:02:24.001 --> 01:02:24.762]  Well, there you go.
[01:02:24.802 --> 01:02:26.102]  There it is for everybody else.
[01:02:26.863 --> 01:02:28.924]  Mark, I mean, their whole thing is imploding.
[01:02:30.467 --> 01:02:44.453]  It's coming down and I mean every day now more and more people are waking up and so there was a time when I felt like there was a lull in 9-11 truth or I myself was starting to doubt whether we're going to get this information out whether even anybody in the mainstream media was going to cover these issues and
[01:02:44.986 --> 01:02:57.635]  Just when I start losing faith, something happens, another big prominent official, another expert comes forward, another instance, another confrontation from one of these criminals on the streets, or a book signing happens, it's posted to the web, makes it to the news.
[01:02:57.655 --> 01:02:58.816]  Well that's why this is key.
[01:02:58.916 --> 01:03:03.279]  If we weren't on the offensive, they would have already staged more attacks, we'd already be in Iran.
[01:03:04.019 --> 01:03:05.620]  And so this, we're trying to save lives.
[01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:16.148]  They can intimidate us and use staged terror events to get the public to buy the end of the Fourth Amendment, the end of the Fifth, the end of the Second, the end of the First, which they're attacking all wholesale and dismantling.
[01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:20.011]  If they're able to sell all this, they would have been able to get away with it.
[01:03:20.051 --> 01:03:23.754]  But now, everybody knows they're torturing, murdering, drug dealing killers.
[01:03:24.234 --> 01:03:25.695]  Everybody knows they killed Kennedy.
[01:03:25.996 --> 01:03:28.698]  The shadow government is now being exposed.
[01:03:29.218 --> 01:03:41.545]  And now it gives protection to good men and women in the CIA, good people in the FBI, good people in the military, to more and more say no, to more and more talk about all the army investigators they've murdered.
[01:03:41.985 --> 01:03:51.351]  General Togumbo, the head Army Brigadier General, who just retired, came out and said, yeah, the government tortures kids, it's murder, it's war crimes, the cover-up's got to be exposed.
[01:03:52.111 --> 01:03:54.953]  And it's literally because they like torturing children.
[01:03:55.333 --> 01:04:07.540]  And they also like setting the precedent that if they can be the good guys and torture children in the ways that, you know, that... Notice how Reagan said the same kind of things that are in the White House orders?
[01:04:08.281 --> 01:04:12.683]  You see, I mean, imagine putting orders out saying, sodomize little kids.
[01:04:12.743 --> 01:04:17.006]  I mean, these people... And I have to argue with people and say that's wrong, Mark Dice?
[01:04:18.598 --> 01:04:20.339]  Yeah, it's just completely immoral.
[01:04:20.419 --> 01:04:26.943]  I'm sure that they're going to be pulling those clips as well, and we just got to continue making copies of them, getting them out there, reposting them.
[01:04:26.983 --> 01:04:34.748]  And Alex, I got to run, but I want to appreciate, I want to thank everybody for their courage and for helping us out and getting the word out, and just a hat tip to everybody out there.
[01:04:35.088 --> 01:04:37.610]  All right, Mark Dice, we'll keep checking in with you as this develops.
[01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:39.231]  YouTube account shut down.
[01:04:39.611 --> 01:04:41.513]  Put pressure on them and phone numbers up on the side.
[01:04:41.553 --> 01:04:41.853]  Thank you.
[01:04:43.166 --> 01:04:45.668]  All right, there goes Mark Dice at work popping in with us.
[01:04:46.168 --> 01:04:50.892]  We're only 23 minutes away from Jordan Maxwell.
[01:04:52.694 --> 01:04:55.376]  23 minutes away from a two-hour interview with Jordan.
[01:04:55.876 --> 01:05:04.043]  I called Jordan about two months ago and he said, oh I'm getting too many threats, too many government people visiting me, threatening me, and I believe it's happening to us.
[01:05:04.823 --> 01:05:06.825]  And he said, I'm not going to do the interview.
[01:05:07.765 --> 01:05:09.026]  And he actually told people that on the web.
[01:05:10.577 --> 01:05:16.679]  And then he decided to do interviews, but now he's getting more stuff happening, and I appreciate him coming on today.
[01:05:17.419 --> 01:05:21.240]  He's got cancer, he's 70-something years old, and he's a real treasure.
[01:05:25.822 --> 01:05:33.764]  But we were able to get him booked again last week, and so he's on the show today, and that is coming up.
[01:05:36.886 --> 01:05:42.909]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:46.551]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:05:47.252 --> 01:05:50.653]  We're going to be talking to an individual who for more than 50 years
[01:05:53.419 --> 01:05:57.501]  Coming up on 50 plus has been fighting the New World Order.
[01:05:57.741 --> 01:06:12.428]  We've been having icons on the show like Gilbert Griffin and many others, but I really can't think of anybody when it comes to really delving deeply into the New World Order and exposing so many dark secrets that we now just take as commonplace knowledge.
[01:06:13.009 --> 01:06:19.592]  So much of it was pioneered and rediscovered because it was all there in the ancient documents and text by Jordan Maxwell.
[01:06:19.932 --> 01:06:21.553]  So we'll be talking to him in just one moment.
[01:06:22.293 --> 01:06:30.380]  Before we go to Jordan, you can pre-order my new film, 9-11 Chronicles, Truth Rising, Part 1, Truth Rising.
[01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:33.302]  And the way the world's going, who knows if there'll be a Part 2?
[01:06:34.423 --> 01:06:48.014]  But it's got Willie Nelson in it, it's got Governor Jesse Ventura, it's got a video interview with George Carlin, who died last night, of course, in Southern California of heart failure, talking about how the government wouldn't have an investigation in 9-11, they wouldn't investigate something they did.
[01:06:48.695 --> 01:06:50.656]  They wouldn't investigate themselves.
[01:06:51.925 --> 01:06:54.368]  I mean, it's got everybody.
[01:06:54.428 --> 01:07:02.656]  Martin Sheen, it's got the head of democracy now saying 9-11 should be investigated, Building 7 should be investigated.
[01:07:03.477 --> 01:07:08.041]  Michael Moore saying it could be an inside job and that firefighters have told him there were bombs in the buildings.
[01:07:10.049 --> 01:07:22.042]  We've got to expand the description that's up on the Infowars.com shopping cart, because it mainly gets into how we confront Schwarzenegger, and how we confront Lynne Cheney, and how just all these people get confronted, hundreds of people.
[01:07:22.403 --> 01:07:25.987]  Barack Obama, I mean, the list goes on and on.
[01:07:26.688 --> 01:07:31.073]  Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and of course John McCain,
[01:07:32.349 --> 01:07:34.511]  With We Are Change and 9-11 Truth and everybody.
[01:07:35.291 --> 01:07:39.094]  The video of We Are Change L.A.
[01:07:39.594 --> 01:07:42.596]  basically taking over Bill Maher's show.
[01:07:45.038 --> 01:07:58.988]  So, it's a story of people standing up, taking action, having a great effect, confronting Bill Clinton, Hillary, Bill Clinton blowing up, admitting Bohemian Grove, admitting Bilderberg, meltdowns, the media saying kill us, arrest us,
[01:07:59.992 --> 01:08:06.317]  But woven through this is the firefighters, police and military and EMTs dying of the dust.
[01:08:06.358 --> 01:08:10.321]  The government documents where they knew it was going to kill them and decided not to give them health care.
[01:08:11.962 --> 01:08:14.845]  All of that is in the film.
[01:08:16.733 --> 01:08:20.097]  And it just completely devastates their official story.
[01:08:21.258 --> 01:08:26.003]  Truth Rising will ship July 5th, so the official release date is July 4th.
[01:08:26.323 --> 01:08:32.049]  It will be on PrisonPlanet.tv midnight, the day July 4th starts.
[01:08:32.089 --> 01:08:36.134]  So as July 3rd ends, that Thursday, on that Friday morning,
[01:08:36.454 --> 01:08:39.655]  Throughout Friday, it will be posted in a bunch of different formats.
[01:08:39.735 --> 01:08:41.395]  DivX formats, you can burn it to disk.
[01:08:41.715 --> 01:08:43.175]  Get it out to people in higher quality.
[01:08:43.656 --> 01:08:48.357]  Flash, a bunch of other systems, super high quality for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[01:08:48.777 --> 01:08:50.137]  Get it out to people, folks.
[01:08:50.897 --> 01:08:52.557]  And yes, you can order the DVD now.
[01:08:52.617 --> 01:08:54.678]  The DVD is being mass replicated right now.
[01:08:55.478 --> 01:09:03.840]  I'm supposed to get them middle of next week, and so we will have them before it even ships, and then we'll be packaging them up later next week, and they will all ship out
[01:09:04.972 --> 01:09:08.019]  on that Saturday and then that next Monday after July 4th.
[01:09:08.079 --> 01:09:13.071]  So get your 9-11 Chronicles Truth Rising today at Infowars.com.
[01:09:13.352 --> 01:09:13.612]  Okay.
[01:09:16.914 --> 01:09:20.256]  I'm really excited about having Jordan Maxwell on the show.
[01:09:20.917 --> 01:09:28.061]  I kind of woke up to the New World Order on my own, or kind of on the John Birch Society route.
[01:09:28.741 --> 01:09:41.669]  I wasn't part of the John Birch Society, but read stuff like, None Dare Call a Conspiracy, The Private Fellow Deserved, and then I learned about Ron Paul fifteen years ago and got a radio show and was kind of a mainline conservative Republican who was anti-New World Order.
[01:09:41.689 --> 01:09:43.370]  Then I found out that that party was controlled.
[01:09:43.731 --> 01:09:45.612]  I mean, even as late as nineteen
[01:09:47.719 --> 01:09:48.279]  Ninety-eight.
[01:09:48.859 --> 01:09:49.399]  Ninety-nine.
[01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:51.940]  I wouldn't get into the occult on air.
[01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:53.140]  I wouldn't talk about it.
[01:09:53.260 --> 01:09:53.921]  I didn't believe it.
[01:09:53.981 --> 01:09:55.781]  I thought, hey, the Federal Reserve is private.
[01:09:55.801 --> 01:09:58.502]  They do want a world government for their administrative convenience.
[01:09:59.202 --> 01:10:04.723]  It is bad, but there's no occult and, you know, there's dumb conspiracy theorists.
[01:10:05.023 --> 01:10:06.384]  There's no black helicopters.
[01:10:06.404 --> 01:10:07.804]  There's no FEMA camp plans.
[01:10:08.224 --> 01:10:09.764]  And then Delta Force invaded Texas.
[01:10:09.784 --> 01:10:10.845]  They bribed police chiefs.
[01:10:11.185 --> 01:10:11.845]  I interviewed them.
[01:10:11.865 --> 01:10:16.266]  I found out they had martial law plans with the San Antonio police chief and the emergency managers.
[01:10:16.986 --> 01:10:21.211]  And then I found out about Bohemian Grove, and I found out it was real, and I infiltrated it.
[01:10:21.511 --> 01:10:24.394]  So really, I am a Johnny-come-lately.
[01:10:25.696 --> 01:10:27.397]  It doesn't matter, we're all Johnny-come-latelys.
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:33.584]  In this short life we have, the point is we can all move forward, take action.
[01:10:34.045 --> 01:10:38.870]  And then I remember Chris Athanas, in about 98, 99, putting Jordan Maxwell videos on.
[01:10:40.154 --> 01:10:52.118]  Local access and I remember watching those and looking into it and I already knew a lot of Egyptian history and other history and so I knew it was accurate because I'd already independently learned it but never put it into thought of what was happening today.
[01:10:52.438 --> 01:10:58.720]  So he really helped wake me up to a larger world and larger view and Jordan Maxwell continues as a preeminent researcher.
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:02.382]  An independent scholar in the field of occult religious philosophy.
[01:11:02.682 --> 01:11:04.924]  His interest in these subjects began far back as 59.
[01:11:05.624 --> 01:11:13.709]  He served for three and a half years as the regional editor of Truth Seeker Magazine, America's oldest free thought journal since 1873.
[01:11:14.069 --> 01:11:17.532]  His work exploring the hidden foundations of Western religions and secret societies
[01:11:18.012 --> 01:11:21.014]  He creates enthusiastic responses from audiences around the world.
[01:11:21.775 --> 01:11:41.548]  He has conducted dozens of intense seminars, hosted his own radio talk show, guested on more than 600 radio shows, and written, produced, and appeared in numerous television shows and documentaries, including the two-hour special for CBS TV Network, as well as the internationally acclaimed five-part Ancient Mysteries series, all devoted to understanding ancient religions and their pervasive influence on world affairs today.
[01:11:42.068 --> 01:11:58.659]  His works on the subject of secret societies, both ancient and modern, and their symbols, has fascinated audiences around the world for decades, considering the rapidly moving events of today, and the very real part these hidden religious agendas play in our modern, war-torn world.
[01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:03.363]  He feels that controversial subjects are not only interesting to explore, but too important to ignore.
[01:12:03.703 --> 01:12:07.746]  His extraordinary presentations include documents and photographs seldom seen elsewhere.
[01:12:08.226 --> 01:12:13.669]  Now, we can argue about our interpretation of what Jordan says, but I agree with the info he brings out.
[01:12:13.769 --> 01:12:15.591]  I may even disagree with some of his interpretations.
[01:12:16.579 --> 01:12:16.619]  on
[01:12:47.041 --> 01:12:50.695]  We may even hold him over a little bit into overdrive today, but I wanted to properly introduce him.
[01:12:51.909 --> 01:12:54.830]  Jordan doesn't like to talk about himself, but he does have cancer.
[01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:57.371]  He is not doing well financially.
[01:12:57.431 --> 01:12:59.032]  I've heard him on a lot of shows over the years.
[01:12:59.052 --> 01:13:01.273]  He never seems to plug his great books and videos.
[01:13:01.713 --> 01:13:07.055]  Go to his website jordanmaxwell.com and buy some of the books and videos and support the guy.
[01:13:07.455 --> 01:13:11.656]  It will open up your mind and help you wake up to other issues.
[01:13:11.737 --> 01:13:17.999]  Support Jordan Maxwell because he's had 50 plus years of fighting the New World Order and we need to support
[01:13:18.619 --> 01:13:45.281]  uh... this uh... gentleman today so jordan maxwell dot com jordan maxwell thank you for coming on with us well thank you alex for having me on uh... yeah i just uh... i can't tell you how much i appreciate your your support and the things you've said and i uh... i thank you for it and yes it's true that uh... i was interested in these subjects as far back as well when i was a you know teenager and
[01:13:45.928 --> 01:14:07.272]  And even earlier, when I was a kid, I used to ask my parents and ask the adults around me questions, and they just would look at me with glassy eyes, and they had no idea in the world what I was talking about, and consequently, I just never understood why people weren't interested in the things that I was, you know?
[01:14:08.032 --> 01:14:12.033]  And so, at 18 years old, I moved to California,
[01:14:13.002 --> 01:14:18.124]  And by myself, ended up in Los Angeles with $9 in my pocket.
[01:14:18.724 --> 01:14:21.085]  No family, no friends here, nobody.
[01:14:21.105 --> 01:14:24.786]  I had no idea in the world, you know, what I was going to do with my life.
[01:14:24.806 --> 01:14:25.927]  But I ended up in L.A.
[01:14:25.967 --> 01:14:28.547]  with $9 in my pocket in downtown L.A.
[01:14:29.908 --> 01:14:38.371]  And somehow or another, I lived through all of it, but I was fascinated with how much people don't know and how much people don't care to know.
[01:14:39.431 --> 01:14:41.752]  And I hear people today say, why don't the
[01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:48.613]  Why doesn't the government tell us the truth, and why doesn't the educational institutes really tell us the truth?
[01:14:49.413 --> 01:14:56.657]  I think it's because they, the Illuminati, know that we, generally speaking, don't want the truth.
[01:14:57.153 --> 01:14:58.834]  We don't want to hear the truth.
[01:14:59.094 --> 01:15:07.278]  Now, I've had Jordan Alitas come up to me, I mean, high-level members of government and others, and say, Alex, and they always say, this is off-record, right?
[01:15:07.298 --> 01:15:08.898]  And I'm a journalist, so it has to be off-record.
[01:15:09.639 --> 01:15:11.600]  And they say, look, the slaves don't want to know.
[01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:13.261]  You're basically one of us.
[01:15:13.321 --> 01:15:14.381]  You want to be enlightened.
[01:15:14.681 --> 01:15:15.482]  You can't help them.
[01:15:15.502 --> 01:15:16.882]  You might as well just take care of yourself.
[01:15:17.442 --> 01:15:18.403]  Well, that's what I'm saying.
[01:15:18.623 --> 01:15:22.945]  I mean, I have to say that that is pretty much true.
[01:15:23.025 --> 01:15:24.926]  And then I also want to ask the question.
[01:15:25.413 --> 01:15:29.134]  How important is it to tell the people the real truth?
[01:15:29.334 --> 01:15:38.476]  I mean, like the movie with, uh, you know, when the, when the military guy was asked by the, uh, the kid, you know, well, what do you want?
[01:15:38.516 --> 01:15:39.817]  He said, I want to know the truth.
[01:15:39.897 --> 01:15:41.557]  And he said, you can't handle the truth.
[01:15:42.577 --> 01:15:46.218]  Um, how important is it to tell people the real truth?
[01:15:46.838 --> 01:15:53.600]  Because what you're doing, uh, and I've learned this the hard way, what you're doing is you're putting your life on the line.
[01:15:54.471 --> 01:16:07.001]  For people who will be entertained for a while hearing you, but they will go on with their regular lives as they always have, watching basketball and doing what they normally do, and life will go on.
[01:16:07.742 --> 01:16:18.990]  Of course, you had the big mouth and was telling people something that they weren't supposed to know, so you end up in trouble, maybe even end up dead or in prison.
[01:16:19.991 --> 01:16:22.073]  The Internal Revenue finds a bad
[01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:26.241]  I think what you're saying is people don't need to take this for granted.
[01:16:26.281 --> 01:16:30.423]  They need to appreciate your work, my work, so many others, because it's dangerous and it's valuable.
[01:16:30.463 --> 01:16:31.403]  You got that right.
[01:16:31.763 --> 01:16:32.423]  That's exactly right.
[01:16:50.029 --> 01:16:52.210]  So the question is, are we casting pearls before swine?
[01:16:52.490 --> 01:16:54.370]  We've got a break, Jordan, a quick break.
[01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:55.210]  We'll come back.
[01:16:55.250 --> 01:16:56.231]  You've got the floor.
[01:16:57.251 --> 01:17:01.272]  But I want to do this interview a little bit different than other interviews, because you don't like talking about yourself.
[01:17:01.612 --> 01:17:07.833]  I want to make you talk about your history, your awakening, because I found talking about people's awakenings tends to wake others up.
[01:17:08.374 --> 01:17:13.035]  Your journey, and then I want to get into the basics of the New World Order, their greatest secrets.
[01:17:14.991 --> 01:17:15.751]  We're good to go.
[01:17:35.993 --> 01:17:38.573]  Are you concerned about cholesterol, blood pressure?
[01:17:38.954 --> 01:17:40.134]  Are you experiencing chest pain?
[01:17:40.154 --> 01:17:40.774]  Alright, let me talk to him.
[01:17:40.794 --> 01:17:56.096]  Your journey, and then I want to get into the basics of the New World Order, their greatest secrets, kind of Jordan Maxwell's greatest hits, because I want to understand your life, your awakening, and then where you see the New World Order going, and we'll take calls.
[01:17:56.717 --> 01:17:58.237]  Jordan Maxwell is our guest.
[01:17:58.357 --> 01:17:59.317]  Is it feeling well today?
[01:17:59.337 --> 01:18:01.837]  Will he be with us for the next hour and 40 minutes?
[01:18:02.038 --> 01:18:02.818]  Maybe longer?
[01:18:03.278 --> 01:18:03.678]  We'll see.
[01:18:03.698 --> 01:18:03.998]  Stay with us.
[01:18:08.226 --> 01:18:10.827]  Are you concerned about cholesterol, blood pressure?
[01:18:11.187 --> 01:18:12.748]  Are you experiencing chest pain?
[01:18:13.248 --> 01:18:17.289]  Are you looking for a more natural method to help improve your health issues?
[01:18:17.749 --> 01:18:20.730]  My husband has had lots of blood pressure problems.
[01:18:21.371 --> 01:18:23.131]  It would just be really high.
[01:18:23.591 --> 01:18:27.453]  The doctor would work with him and he'd give him some medication for a little while.
[01:18:27.513 --> 01:18:30.834]  It would maybe work and then it wouldn't.
[01:18:30.934 --> 01:18:33.555]  He was going back and forth and my husband's not the top
[01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:34.350]  I think so.
[01:18:48.516 --> 01:18:51.798]  And as long as he's been on these, it has literally saved his life.

[01:19:07.797 --> 01:19:11.699]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:19:11.919 --> 01:19:24.185]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:19:24.605 --> 01:19:25.025]  The U.S.
[01:19:25.065 --> 01:19:30.608]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:19:31.028 --> 01:19:33.249]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:19:34.009 --> 01:19:36.169]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[01:19:36.209 --> 01:19:39.050]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[01:19:39.170 --> 01:19:45.211]  However, shocking the economy with a reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[01:19:45.612 --> 01:19:48.972]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.

[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:03.580]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:20.574]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:20:20.994 --> 01:20:24.817]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[01:20:25.157 --> 01:20:31.663]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:20:32.043 --> 01:20:34.986]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[01:20:35.446 --> 01:20:42.952]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[01:21:14.588 --> 01:21:20.752]  Maybe you're one of the 75 million Americans that the Center for Disease Control reports as suffering from internal parasites.

[01:21:55.038 --> 01:21:55.898]  Anthony Hilder.
[01:21:56.458 --> 01:21:57.379]  David Ray Griffin.
[01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:03.723]  I guess you could talk about people like Red Beckman, Law That Never Was.
[01:22:04.504 --> 01:22:05.725]  People fighting the New World Order.
[01:22:07.166 --> 01:22:10.428]  Different genres, but all going in the same direction, trying to wake the sheep up.
[01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:12.550]  He's a real icon.
[01:22:12.570 --> 01:22:13.551]  We appreciate having him on.
[01:22:13.751 --> 01:22:19.113]  Just a network note, we're going to continue and skip this break for Infowars.com listeners and PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[01:22:19.493 --> 01:22:21.654]  Coming up to our next main break, we'll be at 50 after.
[01:22:22.334 --> 01:22:30.577]  Jordan Maxwell, let's start off with, you get there with less than $20 in your pocket in LA when you're 13 years old.
[01:22:31.457 --> 01:22:40.761]  Go through your life, your awakening process, some of the people you ran into over the years, and what that awakening was like.
[01:22:41.707 --> 01:22:46.228]  Well, yeah, I was 18 when I came to Los Angeles, and I had no idea why.
[01:22:46.248 --> 01:22:48.248]  I just felt I had to go somewhere.
[01:22:48.268 --> 01:22:54.130]  Originally, I'm from the South, I'm from Florida, and I ended up in Los Angeles back in 59.
[01:22:55.510 --> 01:23:05.292]  And I had no idea why I was here or what I was going to do with my life, but I just was drawn to the fact that I wanted to know.
[01:23:06.252 --> 01:23:09.973]  And so many people today just don't want to know, and so
[01:23:11.100 --> 01:23:38.418]  That's what drove me and I've done what I have done with nothing for so many years because I have always appreciated the people who made themselves available for me by doing tapes and records and lectures and teachers who I could go to to learn the things that my heart was burning to know and I would attend all the lectures I could
[01:23:39.019 --> 01:23:54.184]  Read everything I could get my hands on, because I wanted to know and I really appreciated those people many years ago that were there out on the front lines like you are today, making the information available so that I could learn.
[01:23:55.004 --> 01:24:05.828]  And so that's what I wanted to do with my life at 19 years old, is to gather up as much information as possible and make it available to all that wanted to hear.
[01:24:05.988 --> 01:24:08.229]  And so I was very idealistic about that.
[01:24:09.795 --> 01:24:11.135]  But I discovered something.
[01:24:11.535 --> 01:24:13.676]  I'll tell you a big secret that I discovered.
[01:24:13.756 --> 01:24:15.836]  It took me many years to figure it out.
[01:24:16.356 --> 01:24:21.618]  But people will always support what they want to hear.
[01:24:22.338 --> 01:24:24.938]  They will not support what they don't want to hear.
[01:24:24.958 --> 01:24:28.119]  And if you like country music, you're not going to pay money for an opera.
[01:24:28.939 --> 01:24:33.680]  If you like classical music, you're not going to pay money to go to an acid rock concert.
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:36.501]  So people will always support what they want to hear.
[01:24:37.463 --> 01:24:41.665]  And so I always assumed as a young person that people were like me.
[01:24:41.726 --> 01:24:43.086]  They wanted to know the truth.
[01:24:43.887 --> 01:24:51.971]  And so I later on discovered that no, most of the time people do not want to know the truth.
[01:24:53.212 --> 01:25:06.820]  They will look at something, see that it's wrong, and then prefer to, as Churchill said, every now and then you'll stumble on the truth, but then you'll pick yourself up, brush yourself off, and go on, act like you never saw it.
[01:25:07.429 --> 01:25:10.810]  And just go on and live your life and go to the ball game and have a good time.
[01:25:11.330 --> 01:25:14.851]  And one day, what comes around goes around.
[01:25:15.111 --> 01:25:29.135]  One day, what you should have looked at, you should have been concerned about, well, when it comes to you finally, and you finally have to see what you could have seen years ago, but you didn't want to.
[01:25:29.695 --> 01:25:33.136]  Well, that's what I wanted to do, is to make this kind of information
[01:25:33.934 --> 01:25:36.936]  Uh, that I was interested in, available to everyone.
[01:25:37.176 --> 01:25:39.797]  And, uh, you mentioned John Birch Society.
[01:25:39.837 --> 01:25:46.580]  As far back as 19... I think they were founded in 1959 in Belmont, Massachusetts.
[01:25:46.620 --> 01:25:57.586]  Well, I used to send research articles to Belmont back in 1961, 62, and 63 to the Birch Society as it was just getting going.
[01:25:57.606 --> 01:26:00.107]  I was doing a lot of research on my own on, uh,
[01:26:01.036 --> 01:26:07.618]  On fascism, Nazism, communism, all of the different movements of the bankers, etc.
[01:26:07.758 --> 01:26:15.401]  So I would just send in articles, and sometimes I'd see some of my work being incorporated into their literature.
[01:26:16.201 --> 01:26:21.883]  And then I began to connect with all kinds of researchers and writers.
[01:26:22.923 --> 01:26:26.945]  And the more I learned, the more I realized how much I don't know.
[01:26:28.101 --> 01:26:42.685]  I realize, too, that most people don't want to know, and that's what really frightened me, because now we're faced with something that is just absolutely beyond most people's ability to even grasp.
[01:26:43.605 --> 01:26:56.948]  And I have no words for it, because I know that this country and this republic cannot be saved as long as there's a flaw in the thinking of the people.
[01:26:57.614 --> 01:27:01.917]  Look at your decisions in life are only as good as your information.
[01:27:03.198 --> 01:27:08.522]  And if you are not willing to look at all of the truth, then you don't have it yet.
[01:27:09.182 --> 01:27:17.448]  And as long as you don't have it all, any attorney will tell you before going into court, if you don't have everything going for you, then don't go.
[01:27:17.728 --> 01:27:22.091]  Don't even try because you're not going to win because you don't know the facts yet.
[01:27:23.112 --> 01:27:26.074]  So that's what I'm trying to do is help people to learn
[01:27:26.980 --> 01:27:33.524]  All the things that they will never be privy to know because they haven't taken the time to do the research.
[01:27:33.564 --> 01:27:34.585]  They don't have the time.
[01:27:34.625 --> 01:27:35.826]  They got wives and families.
[01:27:35.866 --> 01:27:37.027]  Well, I don't have anyone.
[01:27:37.747 --> 01:27:39.688]  And I've lost my wife because of my work.
[01:27:39.729 --> 01:27:40.809]  I've lost my family.
[01:27:40.849 --> 01:27:42.030]  I lost everything I own.
[01:27:42.110 --> 01:27:46.813]  Three times my office was broken into and everything I own in the world was taken.
[01:27:47.834 --> 01:27:52.537]  And consequently, I paid a heavy price for doing what I do, but I just love
[01:27:53.502 --> 01:27:58.986]  Trying to educate and teach people and at least waking them up to what's going on.
[01:27:59.006 --> 01:28:01.128]  I've been doing it for almost fifty years now.
[01:28:01.228 --> 01:28:06.812]  And Jordan, I want to continue along that and I want to go back and talk about your first research.
[01:28:06.832 --> 01:28:08.073]  You know, what led to what?
[01:28:08.133 --> 01:28:09.314]  What you were first into?
[01:28:09.334 --> 01:28:14.258]  I would imagine the private Federal Reserve, the fascist bankers, funding the left and the right.
[01:28:14.819 --> 01:28:19.082]  Because I know from some of your writings that is some of the first things you covered.
[01:28:19.402 --> 01:28:21.164]  Let's get into that when we come back and then
[01:28:22.304 --> 01:28:30.331]  Well, I've got some really extraordinarily important materials on my website that you can't find anywhere else.
[01:28:30.351 --> 01:28:33.513]  I've got three books right on the homepage that I
[01:28:49.966 --> 01:28:51.948]  Two of them, I own the books.
[01:28:52.048 --> 01:28:53.208]  I own the copyright.
[01:28:53.248 --> 01:28:54.589]  That was so important to me.
[01:28:55.130 --> 01:28:56.151]  I got the companies.
[01:28:56.211 --> 01:28:58.933]  They were very old books I found in an old bookstore.
[01:28:59.673 --> 01:29:01.094]  And that was so important to me.
[01:29:01.254 --> 01:29:10.181]  I got a grant from the Truth Seeker company that I was working with and got the attorneys to give me the copyright to the two books, so I owned them.
[01:29:10.982 --> 01:29:16.806]  And I got grants for a publisher to publish them because I felt it was so extraordinarily important.
[01:29:17.518 --> 01:29:19.559]  And two of them are right on my homepage.
[01:29:19.579 --> 01:29:22.180]  There's a third one called Occult Theocracy.
[01:29:22.861 --> 01:29:35.207]  That one you cannot buy at any price anywhere, and it's just such an important book on tracing the cults and the secret societies, all of them through the ages.
[01:29:35.227 --> 01:29:36.848]  It's called Occult Theocracy.
[01:29:37.328 --> 01:29:38.989]  And all of it's right there in the e-books.
[01:29:39.009 --> 01:29:41.350]  You can download it immediately, get it immediately.
[01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:53.507]  And of course all the different, if you go to my download pages, all kinds of extraordinarily interesting documents and materials that it's taken me years to find.
[01:29:54.507 --> 01:29:58.069]  And of course I have a lot of DVDs and tapes and things too.
[01:29:58.790 --> 01:30:05.514]  But mostly I'm interested in those things which most people will never be privileged to know even exist.
[01:30:06.317 --> 01:30:09.119]  That's what's driven me.
[01:30:10.180 --> 01:30:32.297]  I want to run over some of the greatest secrets, but first let's talk about More of Your Awakening, when we get back on the main program in just a moment, and then let's talk about basically what the biggest secrets are, the keys to this, and then we're also going to spend a lot of time on those books before the show ends, because some stations only carry the last hour that's coming up.
[01:30:32.317 --> 01:30:34.699]  We want to make sure people go to the website and get those.
[01:30:34.719 --> 01:30:35.640]  They're very hard to get books.
[01:30:53.168 --> 01:30:54.912]  Jordan Maxwell is our guest.
[01:30:54.992 --> 01:31:00.563]  We're going to talk more about his awakening, his process of awakening, that journey.
[01:31:02.273 --> 01:31:18.741]  And then we're going to get into, basically, the biggest secrets he discovered, the bottom line on how it works, and what the globalist New World Order, a cult kingdom, a cult theocracy's master plan is, with Jordan Maxwell.
[01:31:18.821 --> 01:31:30.567]  Today, the website jordanmaxwell.com, a lot of books, very old books that he owns the copyright to that really break down how they run and control things are there available at jordanmaxwell.com.
[01:31:32.998 --> 01:31:37.521]  Before we end the show, we'll also get out a number where you can call and get some of those books and videos.
[01:31:37.541 --> 01:31:40.242]  There's also a lot of free videos and things in the download section.
[01:31:40.302 --> 01:31:41.303]  Just be sure and check it out.
[01:31:41.343 --> 01:31:45.706]  A picture gallery, great website, JordanMaxwell.com.
[01:31:46.586 --> 01:31:50.829]  You know, I took off last week and went with my family to the Texas beach to spend a few days with them.
[01:31:51.769 --> 01:31:59.474]  And while I was out on the beach, I wrote notes, about 20 pages of notes of what I thought was most important in life.
[01:32:00.604 --> 01:32:06.968]  And one of the things I wrote in here is that I was really thinking about what makes me up, who I am.
[01:32:07.308 --> 01:32:20.936]  And I thought about being a young man and being ego driven and wanting to be tough and good looking and wanting to get in fights with bullies and kind of those base type things you do when you're young, but that's normal.
[01:32:21.396 --> 01:32:22.757]  It's a hierarchy of needs.
[01:32:23.137 --> 01:32:24.358]  It's a journey we're all on.
[01:32:25.168 --> 01:32:30.051]  And I thought about how I still fall back into ego sometimes, but less and less.
[01:32:30.912 --> 01:32:38.036]  It's almost like a long-lost forgotten friend, because it's a great source of energy, ego, but it also blinds you.
[01:32:39.212 --> 01:32:41.515]  And I remember decades ago, people would tell me about ego.
[01:32:41.575 --> 01:32:49.103]  I couldn't even grasp the concept, even in psychology class, because I was still so controlled by ego when I was 18, 19 years old.
[01:32:49.463 --> 01:32:50.705]  But now I understand what it is.
[01:32:50.765 --> 01:32:53.968]  I'm totally separate from my quote, mind.
[01:32:54.169 --> 01:32:56.751]  I can pull back, look at myself, warts and all.
[01:32:58.064 --> 01:33:12.470]  I can analyze what makes humans tick, how we operate, the basic engineering, the basic genetics, what our true values are, what we're truly meant to do, and at the final equation, laying down your life for your neighbor
[01:33:14.454 --> 01:33:38.194]  Means that you save yourself, because when you have that attitude of laying down your life for your neighbor, when you do have courage, when you do care about others, when you're not greedy and filled with hate, when you're not just self-centered, you truly are conscious and can now use your brain, and you understand that in a society where we care about each other, and that means sometimes fighting against evil, that doesn't mean just laying back and being a wimp, that you have a better society, a dynamic system.
[01:33:38.214 --> 01:33:39.275]  Does it mean we're ever perfect?
[01:33:39.335 --> 01:33:41.537]  No, but we're reaching towards something better.
[01:33:43.462 --> 01:33:52.145]  And being there, you know, at the beach, laying in the sand, watching my children play and build sand castles, and seeing God's beautiful creation, you know, the firmament.
[01:33:53.800 --> 01:34:06.255]  You know, just looking at how wonderful this world is and how Madison Avenue has trained us to feel inadequate, to be unhappy, to not see how great things are, but to not also be able to see all the evil that's in the world at the same time.
[01:34:06.295 --> 01:34:09.679]  People are basically blind to the beauty and blind to the ugliness.
[01:34:09.719 --> 01:34:12.061]  They've been stunted and kind of shrunken down.
[01:34:12.081 --> 01:34:13.403]  They're looking at the world through a
[01:34:14.264 --> 01:34:16.145]  Through a straw.
[01:34:16.425 --> 01:34:19.107]  They're seeing such a limited perspective.
[01:34:19.247 --> 01:34:22.909]  And I have a desire to see them have pleasure.
[01:34:23.249 --> 01:34:25.070]  I have a desire to see them be free.
[01:34:25.371 --> 01:34:27.312]  I have a desire to see them do well.
[01:34:27.752 --> 01:34:34.356]  I have a desire, kind of a builder's desire, which is what we're all meant to be, creators, to see their minds unlocked.
[01:34:34.856 --> 01:34:41.060]  And I have a desire to learn more and to challenge myself and to really know the truth.
[01:34:42.225 --> 01:34:56.319]  And it's painful to realize that a lot of them don't want to do that, and they want to be caught in snares, and they want to be killed, and they want to have fluoride put in their water, and they want to be injected with cancer, and they want to give their kids mercury shots, and they don't want to know the truth.
[01:34:56.339 --> 01:35:03.246]  And I wanted to ask Jordan this question, or make this statement and get his take on it, and I wrote here in a little book
[01:35:05.381 --> 01:35:26.075]  That I realize that the instinct to want to build something better for the tribe is a human instinct, and to realize that the human community is bigger than just yourself, and that I want to pass better things on to people, and that all the good things we have is because other good people before us pass them on to us.
[01:35:26.875 --> 01:35:43.717]  There's always been this struggle of good and evil within our own species that's being directed and controlled from above, and you can debate what that intelligence is, and Jordan gets into that, but certainly, for those who have studied, it's there, and the elite know it's there, and communicate with it.
[01:35:44.468 --> 01:35:46.229]  With both sides of it, or whatever it is.
[01:35:46.689 --> 01:35:47.069]  God.
[01:35:47.089 --> 01:35:51.911]  But then they control it and put out a false facsimile for the public.
[01:35:52.091 --> 01:35:55.372]  But my only message is that I'm not just some do-gooder.
[01:35:55.992 --> 01:35:57.353]  I want to transmit knowledge.
[01:35:57.493 --> 01:35:59.233]  I want to tell people the mistakes I've made.
[01:35:59.653 --> 01:36:00.894]  I want to let them know.
[01:36:00.914 --> 01:36:02.294]  I want them to see pitfalls.
[01:36:03.035 --> 01:36:03.895]  And I want to write.
[01:36:03.915 --> 01:36:04.935]  I want to make films.
[01:36:05.135 --> 01:36:07.856]  And it's because I want to communicate with the future.
[01:36:08.276 --> 01:36:09.517]  And I can almost feel
[01:36:10.137 --> 01:36:10.678]  Tangibly.
[01:36:10.758 --> 01:36:14.521]  I do feel it, but is it a facsimile in my mind or is it real?
[01:36:14.841 --> 01:36:35.359]  The bouncing back from the future, the information I've already put out, I can feel the good it's created and I can feel it tangibly coming back at me from the future and I know that I stand on the shoulders of those in the past and I can feel myself with my ancestors and others looking back into the past and into the future.
[01:36:36.179 --> 01:36:46.265]  And if you really want to get down to what makes Alex Jones tick, at the end of the day, when Jordan was just talking, I was going to share this later in the week, it's that I want to make things better for those in the future.
[01:36:46.825 --> 01:36:48.326]  Because I live on through them.
[01:36:48.506 --> 01:36:59.153]  I live on through their pleasure and their pain and their exaltation and the births and the deaths and the lives that were all part of a larger species, like a cell in a larger
[01:36:59.753 --> 01:37:28.544]  uh... organism in the new world order knows that and tries to block us off from ever becoming truly human and communing with our own species in the universe jordan i didn't mean to spend five minutes to learn everything you have to say but i wanted to say that to you because you talked about wanting to know wanting to warn others having this drive this instinct and i absolutely am a kindred spirit with you on that point is that i have this desire to warn people and to know and learn more myself well uh...
[01:37:29.981 --> 01:37:34.885]  I'm so happy that you said those things, because that's exactly what I was going to say.
[01:37:35.406 --> 01:37:41.531]  And I'm older and more tired than you are, so you said it so much better than I would have said it.
[01:37:41.611 --> 01:37:43.232]  That's exactly what I feel.
[01:37:43.793 --> 01:37:46.755]  Precisely what you said is exactly what I feel.
[01:37:46.795 --> 01:37:57.684]  When I was young, when I was younger, I was filled with the zeal for knowledge and wisdom and understanding and questioning everything and talking to all the
[01:37:58.306 --> 01:38:02.329]  Adults that were out there writing and speaking publicly.
[01:38:02.349 --> 01:38:06.691]  I love knowledge and I love the idea of helping my fellow man.
[01:38:06.792 --> 01:38:08.493]  I love watching young people.
[01:38:09.333 --> 01:38:13.216]  Their eyes light up when you show them something they've never seen before.
[01:38:14.156 --> 01:38:16.158]  It's the instinct of a teacher.
[01:38:16.418 --> 01:38:22.442]  And the older I grew, the more I loved talking to audiences and helping them to understand.
[01:38:22.902 --> 01:38:25.404]  Because, you know, like the Apostle Paul says,
[01:38:26.608 --> 01:38:26.969]  I don't
[01:38:45.655 --> 01:38:49.357]  Mom and Pop bookstores.
[01:38:49.397 --> 01:38:50.938]  You emerged from the underground.
[01:38:51.238 --> 01:38:51.918]  Yes, yes.
[01:38:52.138 --> 01:38:58.622]  I had been speaking at little venues, small little venues around Los Angeles.
[01:38:59.222 --> 01:39:15.050]  As far back as 1961 and 62, I was giving lectures in libraries and little small groups, ladies' home groups, and all these little venues on secret societies, Bible codes, Knights Templars,
[01:39:16.249 --> 01:39:24.712]  Nazi fascism, all of the different secret societies that were operating and how they were connected behind the scenes in European bloodlines.
[01:39:25.512 --> 01:39:39.897]  All of that back in the 60s, early 60s, but it wasn't until I was introduced to the work of Myron Fagan, Anthony Hilda put out the records set on Illuminati,
[01:39:40.441 --> 01:39:42.302]  That was in late 66.
[01:39:42.422 --> 01:39:45.844]  Well I got a copy of it almost right after they came out.
[01:39:45.944 --> 01:39:47.464]  And all the pieces came together?
[01:39:48.105 --> 01:39:49.145]  All of it came together.
[01:39:49.425 --> 01:39:54.308]  It all began to make sense of the things which I was already interested in.
[01:39:54.608 --> 01:39:58.429]  Let me interrupt briefly and see if you're on the same page or can expand.
[01:40:00.612 --> 01:40:04.456]  This is for people that are listeners of mine and think that I know more or Jordan knows more than you do.
[01:40:04.476 --> 01:40:05.317]  Let me explain something.
[01:40:05.597 --> 01:40:12.744]  When you get so close to a problem and you understand the different sectors of it, you can be called a master of understanding the New World Order.
[01:40:13.105 --> 01:40:15.547]  As Jordan said, you realize how much you don't know.
[01:40:16.908 --> 01:40:43.600]  And so I would imagine you discovered thousands of things that Myron Fagan didn't know, but that was the last piece, or the master key, the Rosetta Stone, that the tumblers flipped, and then you went, because I know your research, to a whole new level past him, but we have to understand that it was that step that brought you to the next level, and then you bring others, and then you learn more from new people, and then we just exponentially learn.
[01:40:43.620 --> 01:40:43.980]  Go ahead.
[01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:45.141]  That's exactly right.
[01:40:46.272 --> 01:40:53.657]  And so I was then hot on the track of Illuminati as a philosophical concept.
[01:40:54.497 --> 01:41:02.742]  And so I was living in UCLA libraries, USC, Berkeley, I was all over the state.
[01:41:02.762 --> 01:41:09.546]  I personally went to all of those because we didn't have the computers and the technology we have today.
[01:41:09.626 --> 01:41:10.807]  So I personally
[01:41:11.465 --> 01:41:16.307]  Spent years at UCLA's research library, general research.
[01:41:17.728 --> 01:41:27.452]  USC, I used to spend days and weeks and months at USC and the stacks late at night photocopying documents from old books.
[01:41:28.712 --> 01:41:32.594]  And so the more I learned, the more I knew how much I didn't know.
[01:41:33.014 --> 01:41:36.636]  And I was fascinated with every day.
[01:41:36.816 --> 01:41:39.877]  I was learning things and it was as if the spirit
[01:41:40.447 --> 01:41:49.769]  Was bringing me people and bringing things to me because it's as if the spirit in the universe knew that I wanted to know and that I was eager to learn.
[01:41:49.889 --> 01:41:53.230]  And so I was meeting all kinds of interesting people.
[01:41:54.090 --> 01:41:56.791]  And, uh, I, it was just blowing my mind.
[01:41:56.831 --> 01:42:04.653]  And, and then, uh, like I said, about 1988, after I, I had a nervous breakdown because I lost my wife.
[01:42:04.693 --> 01:42:05.573]  I lost my family.
[01:42:05.613 --> 01:42:06.453]  I lost everything.
[01:42:07.350 --> 01:42:07.710]  I don't
[01:42:29.352 --> 01:42:33.816]  All the time I was living with her, she never wanted to hear anything that I was interested in.
[01:42:33.836 --> 01:42:38.139]  Yeah, Richard Gage's wife, Architects and Engineers from 9-11 Truth, left him over this stuff.
[01:42:38.199 --> 01:42:38.940]  It's really sad.
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:39.961]  I'm blessed to have my wife.
[01:42:40.621 --> 01:42:47.286]  And so, you know, that was a terrible blow to me because she just decided she's had enough.
[01:42:47.487 --> 01:42:48.127]  That's it.
[01:42:48.668 --> 01:42:55.833]  She doesn't want... She used to tell me all the time, why don't you just get a job and be like everybody else and just go along the get along.
[01:42:55.893 --> 01:42:57.855]  And I said, my God did not bring me
[01:42:58.345 --> 01:42:58.445]  Yes.
[01:43:18.206 --> 01:43:23.250]  And so I have a very high regard for spiritual things.
[01:43:24.451 --> 01:43:27.213]  But not for the whorehouse churches that are Illuminati controlled.
[01:43:27.433 --> 01:43:40.463]  Yeah, not for the corporation's silly ball that we call the religions today, jumping around on stages with their diamond rings and their effeminate haircuts and jumping around falling down.
[01:43:40.544 --> 01:43:46.168]  It's just an incredible display of stupidity.
[01:43:46.590 --> 01:43:48.451]  Look, think about this.
[01:43:48.651 --> 01:44:15.107]  If you were to go to a particular school for 40 years and study one subject for 40 years and one day come out of that 40 years of study and can't even read or form a sentence correctly and cannot hold an intelligent conversation with your fellow man, what kind of a school is that that you've spent all your life in and can't even read?
[01:44:15.888 --> 01:44:36.681]  Well, the same thing is true with so many Christians who have been Christians all their life, and spent all their life pursuing a church, teachings, and have no idea in the world what certain words mean, the etymology of words and terms and symbols, corporate logos, flags,
[01:44:38.032 --> 01:44:39.933]  Where concepts have come from.
[01:44:39.953 --> 01:44:42.593]  The Obelisk, it's all the complete opposite.
[01:44:43.454 --> 01:44:46.575]  Opposite, totally opposite than what you think it is.
[01:44:47.135 --> 01:44:48.615]  Well, I mean, that's the issue.
[01:44:49.836 --> 01:44:59.358]  And they have Benny Hinn and all those guys, and it's turned out they get government financing to start them off to make it look stupid, to actually turn spiritual people off.
[01:44:59.879 --> 01:45:04.100]  And I've noticed, I want to get your take on this, that the Illuminati, the Globalists are all
[01:45:05.131 --> 01:45:23.726]  Whether it's Ted Turner, Maurice Strong, Prince Philip, David Rockefeller, they're all deeply occultic, deeply into this Illuminati religion of killing their fellow humans for the greater good of Gaia, but then they finance all the atheist groups to tell people there's nothing.
[01:45:24.607 --> 01:45:29.271]  So they really want to turn people off from a true spiritual experience, don't they?
[01:45:29.591 --> 01:45:30.712]  That's exactly right.
[01:45:30.772 --> 01:45:32.974]  There is a world of difference between being
[01:45:33.636 --> 01:45:36.218]  A religious and truly spiritual.
[01:45:36.498 --> 01:45:40.901]  A true spiritual person is exactly what the Bible has Jesus saying.
[01:45:40.981 --> 01:45:45.124]  Go into your inner chambers or go someplace by yourself and pray it.
[01:45:46.705 --> 01:45:48.886]  Pray by yourself to your Father.
[01:45:49.327 --> 01:45:57.072]  You don't need to dance around on the stage with diamond rings and make a fool of yourself by jumping around.
[01:45:57.952 --> 01:46:01.255]  You know, spirituality is between you and your Creator.
[01:46:01.835 --> 01:46:03.216]  And I've always understood that.
[01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:14.644]  And I'm just amazed at how many people buy into, never even asking the questions, where are these people getting the money?
[01:46:16.665 --> 01:46:19.506]  It's just, I don't have words for it.
[01:46:20.066 --> 01:46:20.727]  TBN.
[01:46:20.987 --> 01:46:22.248]  Typical TBN.
[01:46:22.648 --> 01:46:29.991]  They got statues of pagan gods in their yards.
[01:46:30.331 --> 01:46:31.652]  Bacchus Dionysus.
[01:46:32.664 --> 01:46:38.946]  One of the gods that has been used to represent Satan is out there in TBN's courtyard.
[01:46:39.767 --> 01:46:45.929]  The very symbol that the Christianity has used for the devil is sitting in TBN's courtyard.
[01:46:46.590 --> 01:46:48.812]  But, consequently, nobody reads, nobody questions.
[01:46:48.832 --> 01:46:56.458]  They also have copies of the Babylonian altar in some of their TV shows, with plants sitting on it, right in front of everybody.
[01:46:56.478 --> 01:46:57.959]  The one that was at Ishtar's Gate?
[01:46:57.979 --> 01:46:58.880]  Right in your face.
[01:46:59.120 --> 01:46:59.721]  Absolutely.
[01:46:59.781 --> 01:47:02.303]  What's the name of that altar that the Bible says is Satan's seat?
[01:47:02.603 --> 01:47:04.745]  They have copies of it on TV, right in front of you.
[01:47:05.145 --> 01:47:11.150]  Yeah, and the trees, the trees all around TPN, as you walk around, you'll see these spiral trees.
[01:47:11.710 --> 01:47:15.113]  Those spiral trees all over TPN's lot are called
[01:47:15.612 --> 01:47:24.823]  Shiva's phallic, they symbolize the old Hindu religion, the erect phallic of Shiva, the god Shiva.
[01:47:25.473 --> 01:47:27.593]  And TBN has them everywhere!
[01:47:27.814 --> 01:47:41.456]  Everywhere you go, you see sexual symbols, occult stuff... And Crouch, admittedly, has all his homosexual mistresses, but then he speaks out against gay people on his show, and then publicly has all his male mistresses.
[01:47:41.896 --> 01:47:54.499]  And look at... I used to be... My friend died, but a very bright guy, who was just an interesting man, lived down in Balboa Island.
[01:47:55.015 --> 01:47:58.776]  I used to go down to see him, and he worked at a liquor store.
[01:47:58.836 --> 01:48:04.417]  He was very wealthy, but just to have something to do, he worked at a liquor store on the island, Balboa Island.
[01:48:05.297 --> 01:48:10.578]  And he used to tell me, I'd go down to sit on the wharf and talk with him about theology and religion.
[01:48:10.938 --> 01:48:12.138]  Very, very bright guy.
[01:48:12.939 --> 01:48:21.100]  And he would tell me, you know in my liquor store, all the officials from TBN come and buy their booze, and they buy them by cases.
[01:48:22.461 --> 01:48:24.501]  Paul and Jane Crouch come down and buy
[01:48:25.271 --> 01:48:34.274]  Thousands of dollars in booze and whiskey and all kinds and throw their big parties and... I was just thinking to myself, you know, the people are so stupid.
[01:48:35.114 --> 01:48:37.455]  You know, when... Do you ever have one of those days... Hold on, Jordan!
[01:48:37.475 --> 01:48:38.775]  ...where everything goes right?
[01:48:38.955 --> 01:48:42.476]  Uh, John... I get the best parking space at work... John, tonight... Yes, sir?
[01:48:42.557 --> 01:48:43.197]  Let me talk to Jordan.
[01:48:44.397 --> 01:48:45.497]  Yes, you're talking to me.
[01:48:46.638 --> 01:48:53.280]  Hey, uh, we're gonna be... Uh, all the officials from TPN come and buy their booze and they buy them by cases.
[01:48:54.465 --> 01:49:06.453]  Uh, Paul and Jan Crouch come down and buy thousands of dollars in booze and whiskey and all kinds and throw their big parties and I was just thinking to myself, you know, the people are so stupid.
[01:49:07.327 --> 01:49:11.011]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[01:49:11.031 --> 01:49:13.434]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[01:49:13.694 --> 01:49:16.818]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[01:49:16.978 --> 01:49:23.485]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized the contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[01:49:23.885 --> 01:49:25.988]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[01:49:26.488 --> 01:49:29.531]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[01:49:29.771 --> 01:49:34.395]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[01:49:34.555 --> 01:49:38.258]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[01:49:38.498 --> 01:49:40.019]  Travel less, meet online.

[01:50:08.379 --> 01:50:09.800]  It is a big idea.
[01:50:09.820 --> 01:50:11.902]  A new world order.
[01:50:12.642 --> 01:50:16.805]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:50:17.518 --> 01:50:19.240]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[01:50:19.461 --> 01:50:22.565]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[01:50:23.125 --> 01:50:25.588]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:50:26.309 --> 01:50:33.639]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:50:36.661 --> 01:50:41.644]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:50:42.105 --> 01:50:45.587]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:50:45.967 --> 01:50:48.469]  Build a barrier to make great progress for the world government.
[01:50:48.529 --> 01:50:49.690]  Most people have no idea.
[01:50:49.710 --> 01:50:50.470]  They're not after money.
[01:50:50.490 --> 01:50:51.571]  They have all the money they need.
[01:50:51.771 --> 01:50:52.492]  They're after power.
[01:50:52.752 --> 01:50:53.592]  That's what happens here.

[01:51:02.638 --> 01:51:03.079]  In Game.
[01:51:03.379 --> 01:51:05.060]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:51:05.420 --> 01:51:06.461]  You have been warned.
[01:51:07.402 --> 01:51:09.623]  Have you heard about American Free Press?
[01:51:10.283 --> 01:51:15.767]  American Free Press, the only national newspaper that endorsed Ron Paul for president.
[01:51:16.407 --> 01:51:20.529]  American Free Press, written by patriots for patriots.
[01:51:21.130 --> 01:51:23.331]  Standing firm for our Constitution.
[01:51:23.891 --> 01:51:26.333]  Standing firm against the New World Order.
[01:51:26.893 --> 01:51:28.574]  Hammering the enemies of freedom.
[01:51:29.175 --> 01:51:31.456]  Exposing the intrigues of the global elite.
[01:51:32.253 --> 01:51:39.809]  American Free Press hits the Bilderbergers and Trilateralists, and the whole Council on Foreign Relations gang head-on.
[01:51:40.290 --> 01:51:43.797]  Here's your chance to catch up with the news from American Free Press.
[01:51:53.601 --> 01:51:55.022]  I can't get any relief.
[01:51:55.062 --> 01:51:58.804]  Jimi Hendrix had tapped into what was really going on.
[01:51:58.924 --> 01:52:04.248]  I love the part of this song that says, there are many here among us.
[01:52:22.210 --> 01:52:23.971]  Who think that life is but a joke.
[01:52:28.172 --> 01:52:30.933]  They are... The mind is an incredible thing.
[01:52:30.973 --> 01:52:39.776]  If they willfully want to be stupid and want to be in denial, their mind will engineer itself to build into that reality.
[01:52:39.876 --> 01:52:41.137]  That's what Jordan was saying earlier.
[01:52:43.058 --> 01:52:44.738]  They will decide to believe a lie.
[01:52:47.719 --> 01:52:49.560]  They will decide to be fools.
[01:52:51.167 --> 01:53:01.012]  I can have the Chicago Tribune admitting Dyncor and Halliburton, kidnapped over a million women and children, put them in slave camps, sell them to people to make snuff films.
[01:53:01.992 --> 01:53:03.433]  They even admit it in the newspaper.
[01:53:03.873 --> 01:53:04.894]  Nobody goes to jail.
[01:53:06.574 --> 01:53:08.215]  Trillions are missing from the Pentagon.
[01:53:09.036 --> 01:53:14.238]  I have all the government documents where they put cancer viruses in the vaccines, poisons in our water.
[01:53:15.579 --> 01:53:17.740]  You tell a yuppie that and they just laugh at you.
[01:53:19.060 --> 01:53:19.741]  It's funny to them.
[01:53:20.652 --> 01:53:25.676]  It's funny because they couldn't face the reality of how horrifying it really is.
[01:53:25.797 --> 01:53:26.757]  They are cowards.
[01:53:27.678 --> 01:53:30.681]  And I'm not somebody full of courage.
[01:53:30.821 --> 01:53:32.963]  If somebody's attacking me, I want to stop it.
[01:53:33.663 --> 01:53:42.251]  But see, these cowards are so cowardly, they could have a lion ripping their guts out and they'd probably deny it and go into a blackout and say, a lion isn't tearing my guts out.
[01:53:44.073 --> 01:53:46.694]  Boy, I can't comment on it, because you said exactly what I'm thinking.
[01:53:46.714 --> 01:53:49.095]  That's precisely the point, that the public has left their sanity.
[01:53:49.115 --> 01:53:51.056]  They have been robbed of their sanity and their humanity.
[01:54:15.348 --> 01:54:16.429]  I don't know what to do about it.
[01:54:17.030 --> 01:54:22.738]  At this point, I just do the best I can to try and help people who want to be helped.
[01:54:23.294 --> 01:54:25.775]  Those who don't want to hear it, they're not going to hear it anyway.
[01:54:25.955 --> 01:54:43.925]  Finishing up with Crouch, though, I grew up by Bob Tilton, Larry Lee, a bunch of other preachers, and I didn't see the Lees doing a bunch of partying, but with Tilton and some others, I mean, I saw incredible stuff that I won't even say on air in our neighborhood.
[01:54:44.566 --> 01:54:45.086]  Oh, I know.
[01:54:45.266 --> 01:54:45.906]  I can imagine.
[01:54:45.926 --> 01:54:48.748]  That's what I'm talking about, but people love it.
[01:54:49.096 --> 01:54:54.798]  I mean, every time you turn on television, the place is just crowded with people, and they're just enjoying it.
[01:54:55.578 --> 01:55:10.324]  And what just blows my mind on this is that you see thousands and thousands of people, you know, coming to these churches to listen, and they're learning nothing.
[01:55:11.324 --> 01:55:14.726]  Actually, intellectually learning nothing.
[01:55:15.166 --> 01:55:18.347]  And, you know, 20 years later, they're still jumping around.
[01:55:18.968 --> 01:55:25.090]  Seeking elms and loving the Lord, and have no idea in the world how to read.
[01:55:25.370 --> 01:55:27.451]  That the Lord is Baphomet.
[01:55:27.971 --> 01:55:31.292]  Yeah, it's just incredible ignorance.
[01:55:31.753 --> 01:55:41.436]  People who cannot read, they don't think, they don't question anything, and that's why the entire human race is going under.
[01:55:42.034 --> 01:55:46.479]  Because the human family have lost their ability to even think.
[01:55:47.340 --> 01:55:53.386]  Now, Jordan, we've got to start in the next hour, and it's only a 60 second break, 70 seconds with the tag, so stay there.
[01:55:53.766 --> 01:55:58.591]  I really want to get into whatever it is you want to cover, whatever areas you want to cover when we get back.
[01:55:58.932 --> 01:56:01.294]  I want to bring up a few controversies, a few issues.

[01:57:04.669 --> 01:57:06.410]  The truth story of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:57:06.570 --> 01:57:07.811]  The late, great USA.
[01:57:08.051 --> 01:57:09.472]  America, freedom to fascism.
[01:57:09.813 --> 01:57:16.657]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[01:58:12.535 --> 01:58:14.357]  Overdrive time to take phone calls.
[01:58:14.777 --> 01:58:17.639]  We'll do that off my phone system in my studio.
[01:58:18.260 --> 01:58:23.144]  So that is coming up for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and folks listening on the InfoWars.com streams.
[01:58:25.285 --> 01:58:27.407]  Okay, going back to Jordan Maxwell.
[01:58:27.427 --> 01:58:33.672]  This is another short break and a long one's coming up, Jordan, but I'm going to go ahead and skip this break to note the network so we can continue to 20 after.
[01:58:36.243 --> 01:58:37.764]  You know, I never get into infighting.
[01:58:37.864 --> 01:58:40.365]  I never really talk about groups fighting with each other.
[01:58:40.745 --> 01:58:44.327]  People tried to even get us to, you know, pick fights with each other.
[01:58:44.347 --> 01:58:46.008]  They tried to get other people to do it.
[01:58:46.028 --> 01:58:55.714]  I've noticed you never get involved in all that, Jordan, but you have pioneered so much of the research that is now the mainstay of a lot of people out there.
[01:58:56.814 --> 01:59:01.957]  And then I get people emailing me saying, what's going on with Jordan Maxwell and this researcher?
[01:59:01.977 --> 01:59:03.838]  What's going on with Jordan Maxwell and that researcher?
[01:59:04.158 --> 01:59:07.200]  And then I go look it up and find out you've said nothing or done nothing.
[01:59:08.601 --> 01:59:11.903]  And that's how the disinfo people, they're key at getting us to fight with each other.
[01:59:12.723 --> 01:59:22.388]  But just on record, tell me about some of the people you woke up to the New World Order, some of the people you educated, who then kind of took your work and then added on to it or did their own thing.
[01:59:23.528 --> 01:59:28.691]  Go through some of the folks that we could say that you first met or that you woke up.
[01:59:29.411 --> 01:59:35.374]  Well, a classic example is back in 1988 when I first started going public.
[01:59:36.294 --> 01:59:39.216]  I had a family that I was very close to here.
[01:59:40.320 --> 01:59:48.887]  And one of the boys, I mean, one of the girls in the family, her name was Gloria.
[01:59:49.568 --> 01:59:50.969]  Gloria was a young girl.
[01:59:51.109 --> 02:00:01.317]  She used to come over to my office in Glendale when I was first going public, and she would tell me about how she just loved what I was doing and loved all the research.
[02:00:01.398 --> 02:00:05.161]  And I knew her, I knew the family, and so I suspected nothing.
[02:00:05.241 --> 02:00:09.164]  And she asked if she could photocopy all my documents and materials that I was
[02:00:09.665 --> 02:00:11.066]  Working on it, of course.
[02:00:11.126 --> 02:00:14.849]  So I gave her boxes upon boxes over a two-day period.
[02:00:15.370 --> 02:00:27.279]  It was a photocopy shop in the building I was in, so she just spent all day, all afternoon and all evening photocopying all the research materials and documents and everything that I had.
[02:00:28.140 --> 02:00:39.229]  And later on, about a year later, I get a phone call from a mutual friend that knew both Gloria and myself, and said, Jordan, you know, there's a new book out with all of your work in it.
[02:00:40.073 --> 02:00:42.195]  Uh, the guy's name was Fritz Springmeier.
[02:00:42.235 --> 02:00:44.357]  It's called Bloodlines of the Illuminati.
[02:00:45.338 --> 02:00:46.218]  And I was shocked.
[02:00:47.039 --> 02:00:53.004]  And I, so I called Fritz Springmeier and I said, Fritz, what is this book, Bloodlines of the Illuminati?
[02:00:53.905 --> 02:00:57.748]  And he said, well, uh, Jordan, anybody could have done that kind of research.
[02:00:57.828 --> 02:00:58.929]  Anybody could have done that.
[02:00:59.610 --> 02:01:02.692]  I said, yeah, anyone could have done it, but it was me that did it.
[02:01:03.933 --> 02:01:08.057]  And consequently, uh, you know, now it's a big book out there, Bloodlines of the Illuminati.
[02:01:08.618 --> 02:01:12.980]  Which French spring mare got from Jordan Maxwell and never even said thank you.
[02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:25.185]  I mean, I gave John Rapoport a job, but he didn't have a job and sat for hours with John Rapoport and told him about my work in San Diego when I brought him in and hired him to work with me.
[02:01:25.885 --> 02:01:29.907]  Later on, he creates a book called The Secret Behind Secret Societies.
[02:01:30.167 --> 02:01:30.907]  It's all my work.
[02:01:31.808 --> 02:01:36.830]  And of course, I worked with Richard Hoagland and Zachariah Sitchin around the world five times.
[02:01:37.714 --> 02:01:44.036]  I met the company of Truth Seekers, and Zachariah I have the highest respect for, a wonderful man.
[02:01:44.336 --> 02:01:46.516]  And Richard Holguin, still a great friend of mine.
[02:01:47.076 --> 02:02:00.820]  But I've worked with so many people, and then when I hear lecturers like Jim Mars and Tex Mars, especially Jim Mars, talking about Illuminati and secret societies, I think, hell, I was talking about that stuff back in 62!
[02:02:02.313 --> 02:02:04.555]  I was talking about that 45 years ago.
[02:02:04.635 --> 02:02:16.045]  But Jordan, I mean, that's also a sign of your success and Myron Fagan's and others that we do want other people to go out and put the information out.
[02:02:16.646 --> 02:02:17.266]  Of course we do.
[02:02:17.306 --> 02:02:24.753]  But I can certainly see in a case where you think somebody went and got your material and then put it into a book and gave you no credit, that is bad.
[02:02:24.793 --> 02:02:26.154]  But at the same time,
[02:02:27.591 --> 02:02:28.352]  Well, I understand.
[02:02:57.791 --> 02:03:00.492]  And I'm a Johnny-come-lately.
[02:03:01.032 --> 02:03:08.734]  It is very frustrating, and I think what you're saying is, after a long, fruitful life, it's still very fruitful, you want the credit that's due to you.
[02:03:09.275 --> 02:03:16.197]  Well, I just would like to straighten out some of the stuff that's been done that has aggravated me over the years.
[02:03:17.037 --> 02:03:21.638]  I realize that the highest form of flattery is to be copied.
[02:03:23.499 --> 02:03:26.760]  I don't have any problem with that, but when I
[02:03:27.501 --> 02:03:32.144]  When I'm talking about a subject someone taught me, I always give that person's name.
[02:03:33.305 --> 02:03:35.506]  Well, so do I. Exactly.
[02:03:35.526 --> 02:03:43.271]  I think the point you're trying to make here is, let me guess, because I've seen some of this, I'm not really guessing, you get accused of taking their work.
[02:03:43.892 --> 02:03:44.312]  Of course.
[02:03:44.472 --> 02:03:46.093]  And that's what drives you crazy.
[02:03:46.593 --> 02:03:47.594]  That's exactly right.
[02:03:48.014 --> 02:03:53.238]  I know I sat with them personally and gave all kinds of information and knowledge to them.
[02:03:53.638 --> 02:03:55.039]  Today they go out and they're
[02:03:55.584 --> 02:03:57.868]  They are the big shots who are making all the money.
[02:03:57.888 --> 02:03:59.810]  I live in two rooms with nothing.
[02:04:00.231 --> 02:04:08.503]  So it's kind of like you're a computer programmer who developed the program and then it's not just that they use your program, they then say it's their program.
[02:04:08.891 --> 02:04:16.094]  Yeah, that's very frustrating, especially when you get older and you realize how important the work is.
[02:04:16.174 --> 02:04:17.755]  It's kind of like this.
[02:04:18.475 --> 02:04:24.197]  I mean, let's say you're the guy that found the North Pole, and then you're reading the history books and it's saying somebody else did it.
[02:04:24.658 --> 02:04:25.918]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:04:27.099 --> 02:04:34.182]  And so that's why I want to get this off my chest, because I don't think I'm going to be doing a whole lot of radio anymore.
[02:04:34.222 --> 02:04:37.163]  I just don't feel very well
[02:04:38.372 --> 02:04:38.932]  Physically.
[02:04:39.552 --> 02:04:43.713]  And I just don't have the old drive to talk to people anymore.
[02:04:43.733 --> 02:04:45.994]  I just don't have it.
[02:04:46.114 --> 02:04:49.655]  I've been right through the calls and had so many terrible tragedies in my life.
[02:04:49.735 --> 02:04:53.476]  I just don't feel like doing what I've done all my life.
[02:04:53.896 --> 02:04:55.636]  I've lost the joy of my work.
[02:04:55.676 --> 02:04:58.537]  Well, Jordan, some stations aren't hearing this little segment.
[02:04:58.557 --> 02:05:00.797]  We're back to the full audience in about 30 seconds.
[02:05:01.278 --> 02:05:06.539]  Let's come in, make clear that it's the point, that it isn't that you even want credit, it's that
[02:05:07.259 --> 02:05:09.060]  People then get credit for your work.
[02:05:09.260 --> 02:05:10.540]  So there's a big difference there.
[02:05:11.221 --> 02:05:13.401]  And then let's also talk about some of the things you've gone through.
[02:05:13.421 --> 02:05:17.563]  And then let's get into some of the biggest secrets in just a moment.
[02:05:17.583 --> 02:05:20.464]  And we'll also try to get you some of that support that you need.
[02:05:20.504 --> 02:05:21.665]  Because I know Anthony Hilder.
[02:05:22.165 --> 02:05:22.685]  I know you.
[02:05:22.885 --> 02:05:28.588]  I know that you are one of the very first people to really expose all this at a very deep level.
[02:05:28.648 --> 02:05:30.828]  And I want you to know I'm very thankful for you.
[02:05:31.289 --> 02:05:31.589]  Here we go.
[02:05:35.702 --> 02:05:57.538]  He's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network Okay to be clear Jordan has always been a very magnanimous very friendly very Helping generous person and I've talked to him on and off air his main point is
[02:05:59.145 --> 02:06:03.469]  Like you said in your own words, is that it's not that only that people take a lot of his work and don't give him credit.
[02:06:04.090 --> 02:06:09.675]  It's that he then gets emails and posts about, oh this person came out with this and Jordan took it.
[02:06:10.635 --> 02:06:14.119]  And I think that's, and then people start fights up between people.
[02:06:15.019 --> 02:06:18.482]  I was just talking to Jordan, he's saying he won't be doing very many interviews in the future.
[02:06:18.743 --> 02:06:20.284]  It was hard to even get Jordan on.
[02:06:20.324 --> 02:06:22.346]  We called him a few months ago, he said he wasn't doing interviews.
[02:06:22.846 --> 02:06:24.807]  Let's walk through that specifically on your own words.
[02:06:42.853 --> 02:07:04.209]  You were telling me during the last little behind-the-scenes interview we were doing for the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers that yes, that people make these fights up, and I think it is people in the government in this info, to get researchers fighting where people will then say, Jordan Maxwell took this guy's research, and you're laughing because you were around forty years before they even showed up.
[02:07:04.550 --> 02:07:08.332]  You were around before I was a zygote in my mother's womb.
[02:07:09.153 --> 02:07:15.476]  You were doing this, you know, 40 years before, you know, other people popped up on the scene.
[02:07:16.337 --> 02:07:34.807]  I've said that even to audiences that some of the people that are out there talking today about this subject of secret societies, the Illuminati, Bible codes, Knights Templars, international banking, all of that stuff I was talking about back in the 60s, early 60s, 62, like I said, a beginning.
[02:07:37.629 --> 02:07:43.995]  I used to send a lot of articles to the Burt Society way back in 1661.
[02:07:44.735 --> 02:07:54.344]  I was giving a lecture in downtown Hollywood, in East Hollywood, to a Christian group the day that John Kennedy was assassinated.
[02:07:54.904 --> 02:08:02.451]  I was giving a lecture in downtown Hollywood on secret societies and occult religions.
[02:08:03.135 --> 02:08:06.317]  In 1963, when Kennedy was assassinated.
[02:08:06.677 --> 02:08:08.898]  I've been talking about this stuff for 48 years.
[02:08:09.258 --> 02:08:10.999]  Well, we owe a debt to you.
[02:08:11.019 --> 02:08:21.144]  I mean, let's briefly talk about some of the shoulders that you and others stand on so that we can stand on yours in this fight against tyranny and lies and fraud and dehumanization and greed and control.
[02:08:21.504 --> 02:08:22.584]  You were saying Myron Fagan.
[02:08:22.624 --> 02:08:24.465]  What about Eustace Mullins?
[02:08:24.485 --> 02:08:29.488]  I mean, his work on the Federal Reserve, he really was the guy helping get the book.
[02:08:29.748 --> 02:08:30.308]  Oh, yeah.
[02:08:30.488 --> 02:08:32.209]  Eustace Mullins did tremendous
[02:08:32.782 --> 02:08:33.822]  We're good to go.
[02:08:51.388 --> 02:08:55.690]  I'm just an ordinary man interested in extraordinary knowledge.
[02:08:55.710 --> 02:09:06.535]  Well, I think the key here is, though, you codified so much of it, and before you came along, you'd have to go read a hundred high-level Masonic books, you'd have to go to the libraries, look at the real meanings of gods.
[02:09:06.895 --> 02:09:16.939]  So what you did is, that knowledge was there, but that was kind of their internal knowledge, and so you did bring to the world so much of what's going on today.
[02:09:17.799 --> 02:09:18.780]  I've seen online
[02:09:19.540 --> 02:09:22.582]  A little, you know, people trying to create a controversy between you and David Icke.
[02:09:22.803 --> 02:09:28.447]  Tell me, I mean, just to set the record straight, because people try to stir up stuff between you guys, let's set the record straight.
[02:09:28.467 --> 02:09:29.387]  What's really happening there?
[02:09:29.768 --> 02:09:40.836]  Well, I appreciate that, because I've been wanting to talk about this for a long time, because there is a lot, I get a lot of emails and phone calls about, well, you said this about David Icke, or David Icke said that.
[02:09:41.677 --> 02:09:46.200]  First of all, I don't have any problems with anything David Icke is talking about.
[02:09:46.980 --> 02:09:51.563]  As a matter of fact, I gave him a lot, and he's gotten a lot from me.
[02:09:52.243 --> 02:09:57.706]  But I did, in point of fact, myself, in 1992, I brought David Icke to America.
[02:09:58.407 --> 02:09:59.608]  I'm the one that brought him here.
[02:10:00.508 --> 02:10:13.996]  And I was in San Diego at the time, and a young lady named Alice Ferguson came to my office in San Diego with a man, a friend of hers, named David Griffith.
[02:10:14.548 --> 02:10:17.230]  And Alice Ferguson, David Griffith, came to my office.
[02:10:17.290 --> 02:10:22.774]  I was pretty much running a company down in San Diego called Truth Seeker Company.
[02:10:23.415 --> 02:10:33.743]  And she asked me if I would help bring her friend to America, who was doing, who was very interested in all my work, and he was trying to do the same thing in England.
[02:10:33.883 --> 02:10:35.584]  So I said, well, who is this person?
[02:10:35.684 --> 02:10:37.205]  And so she said, it's David Icke.
[02:10:38.166 --> 02:10:41.148]  So I listened to her for about an hour, and we talked about it.
[02:10:41.188 --> 02:10:42.870]  And I said, all right, I'll tell you what I'll do.
[02:10:43.826 --> 02:10:47.007]  I'll give both you and David Griffin a job.
[02:10:47.067 --> 02:10:53.489]  I'll pay both of you $2,500 a month and I'll get you because they didn't have a place to live.
[02:10:53.529 --> 02:10:57.170]  They were over here to promote David Icke and they didn't have a place to live.
[02:10:57.210 --> 02:11:00.851]  They were staying with some friends in San Diego so I got them both an apartment.
[02:11:01.651 --> 02:11:05.692]  I gave them both $3,000 apiece to buy furniture for their apartments.
[02:11:06.312 --> 02:11:13.054]  I gave them both a job for $2,500 a month plus they both had the credit cards for the
[02:11:13.646 --> 02:11:13.946]  I think?
[02:11:34.318 --> 02:11:51.244]  And eventually, Alice Ferguson talked with Bonnie Lang, the lady who was running the company, and a couple of other women in the office, and they decided that, why don't we just fire Jordan Maxwell, get rid of him, and bring David Icke in to take his place?
[02:11:51.364 --> 02:11:52.404]  And so that's what happened.
[02:11:52.464 --> 02:11:58.086]  I got fired by the same people that I tried to help and bring David Icke to America.
[02:11:58.746 --> 02:12:01.527]  I got fired so that David could take my job.
[02:12:02.501 --> 02:12:13.204]  But after they fired me, they found out that David was not interested in sitting in an office running a company like Jordan Maxwell, so then the company went downhill from there because I was gone.
[02:12:13.964 --> 02:12:24.748]  And they had already fired me, and David didn't want the job, and so they just cut their nose off despite their face, and so the Truth Seeker company is now defunct, and it's no longer around.
[02:12:26.332 --> 02:12:35.818]  At that time I was helping, because I had access to the corporation funds, I was helping Richard Hoagland, Zachariah Sitchin.
[02:12:36.418 --> 02:12:39.520]  As I said, John Rapoport had no job.
[02:12:39.620 --> 02:12:48.325]  I called John Rapoport, gave him a job, got him started again, and he went out and wrote a book on my work called Secret Societies.
[02:12:50.990 --> 02:13:07.696]  So, of course, I don't know if we were on the air at the time when we were talking about the Fritz Springmeier with the bloodlines of the Illuminati, but all of that was taken from me back in 1988 by Fritz Springmeier's girlfriend, Gloria Mascarella.
[02:13:07.736 --> 02:13:18.100]  So, all of these people that I have, you know, and of course, I was giving lectures in the motion picture studios and all the different recording studios
[02:13:18.587 --> 02:13:29.053]  Back in the 70s and 80s, I was going around to motion picture studios at night and just the working class people in the studios would give me a pass.
[02:13:29.373 --> 02:13:33.535]  Yeah, I know some say that they took the idea of the Matrix from you.
[02:13:33.595 --> 02:13:34.095]  Is that true?
[02:13:34.556 --> 02:13:44.541]  Well, I had a video called Matrix of Power about 10 years before the movie Matrix came out, but I don't think that they
[02:13:45.149 --> 02:13:50.410]  Well, maybe they might have been influenced by the Matrix because it was a big seller when it came out.
[02:13:50.650 --> 02:13:51.350]  One never knows.
[02:13:51.430 --> 02:14:02.933]  But what I do know is that there's that directly from my video with one of my first videos ever done was called the basic slide presentation.
[02:14:03.053 --> 02:14:08.694]  And if you get my basic slide presentation, that's the one that may be famous all over the world.
[02:14:08.914 --> 02:14:10.935]  And it was a two hour video.
[02:14:12.592 --> 02:14:21.616]  Out of that, at the very beginning of the basic slide presentation, and get that, and watch it, and then get the movie, Da Vinci Code.
[02:14:22.336 --> 02:14:41.265]  And it is exactly, word for word, exactly, in the Da Vinci Code, at the beginning of the movie, they introduce Tom Hanks as the world's foremost researcher in occult societies and secret societies, and he comes up on the stage,
[02:14:42.020 --> 02:15:05.257]  This is in the movie, Da Vinci Code, and he comes up on the stage and he's got a screen and a slide projector, and on the screen, being projected on the screen, is the symbol on the back of the dollar bill with the pyramid, and he walks in front of the projection, so some of it is being projected on him, and he's now pointing to the pyramid, the all-seeing eye, etc.
[02:15:06.030 --> 02:15:10.213]  And talking about the Illuminati and secret societies on the dollar bill, etc.
[02:15:10.613 --> 02:15:15.956]  That came directly out of my Basics Live presentation, period.
[02:15:17.097 --> 02:15:17.537]  Period.
[02:15:17.797 --> 02:15:23.440]  It came directly out of my video, and nobody ever called me to send me a check.
[02:15:23.560 --> 02:15:28.663]  Da Vinci Code, of course the whole idea of Da Vinci Code was a rip-off of Bajat, Lee, and Lincoln.
[02:15:29.504 --> 02:15:33.086]  The entire movie, Da Vinci Code, was an absolute rip-off
[02:15:33.661 --> 02:15:42.948]  Of the British writers, Bajent Leigh and Lincoln, and their book that appeared about 15 years before the movie, called Holy Blood, Holy Grail.
[02:15:43.509 --> 02:15:57.680]  And so the producers of Da Vinci Code ripped off Bajent Leigh and Lincoln's book, Holy Blood, Holy Grail, and made it into a movie, and act like they came up with something new.
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.362]  And there was a lawsuit in England because of that.
[02:16:01.286 --> 02:16:04.990]  I'm not the only one that's been ripped off and lied to and cheated and left for dead.
[02:16:18.323 --> 02:16:19.884]  So people appreciate the work you've done.
[02:16:20.204 --> 02:16:24.666]  Now I want to shift gears for the rest of this hour into the biggest secrets, the biggest issues.
[02:16:25.086 --> 02:16:26.367]  You know, what makes them tick?
[02:16:26.507 --> 02:16:29.488]  Big, broad, you know, basic info.
[02:16:29.508 --> 02:16:30.869]  We can go back into more detail.
[02:16:31.329 --> 02:16:41.833]  Okay, then let me say then, if you're up for that, just remember that when you ask for something, you know, make sure you're ready for it.
[02:16:43.903 --> 02:16:48.726]  You know, make sure what you ask for you're ready for because it might be something that you weren't expecting.
[02:17:14.564 --> 02:17:19.007]  And the guest he has on, and all my guests, can talk about whatever they want.
[02:17:19.027 --> 02:17:20.569]  The callers can talk about whatever they want.
[02:17:20.609 --> 02:17:21.550]  We don't screen calls.
[02:17:22.050 --> 02:17:22.370]  Nothing.
[02:17:22.410 --> 02:17:24.752]  Anybody that says otherwise is a liar.
[02:17:25.913 --> 02:17:26.354]  Stay there.
[02:17:26.574 --> 02:17:27.615]  Quick break, Jordan.
[02:17:28.576 --> 02:17:29.536]  And we'll come back.
[02:17:29.556 --> 02:17:32.339]  You've got a couple minute break you can take, and we'll be right back.
[02:17:35.552 --> 02:17:37.213]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:17:37.514 --> 02:17:40.956]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:17:41.136 --> 02:17:42.978]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:17:43.198 --> 02:17:46.320]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:17:46.621 --> 02:17:52.085]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:17:52.365 --> 02:17:56.268]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[02:17:56.608 --> 02:18:01.530]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[02:18:01.790 --> 02:18:04.570]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.
[02:18:04.851 --> 02:18:11.693]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded or streamed in super high quality directly to your computer or iPhone and shared with others.
[02:18:12.073 --> 02:18:17.875]  Thousands of special video reports, from tainted vaccines to martial law, can be found in this online video library.
[02:18:18.055 --> 02:18:22.536]  My weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[02:18:22.896 --> 02:18:25.358]  Hi, this is Dave from Ready Reserve Foods.
[02:18:25.378 --> 02:18:33.843]  I have been waiting patiently for the government and mainstream media to inform you of what is turning out to be the biggest problem facing the world in the last 50 years.
[02:18:45.404 --> 02:18:50.607]  For the last three years, the Earth has consumed more food than it has been able to produce, and it has now finally caught up with us.
[02:18:50.927 --> 02:18:57.031]  In the U.S., commodities such as flour and rice are already being rationed, and the next rice crop won't be available for another four to five months.
[02:18:57.812 --> 02:19:04.275]  It's fall in the Southern Hemisphere, and many countries are short the food necessary to make it through the winter and have stopped exporting certain commodities altogether.
[02:19:05.056 --> 02:19:06.177]  Remember our trade deficit?
[02:19:06.637 --> 02:19:11.640]  Trillions of dollars have stacked up outside the country and are now rushing in to buy our food production at any price.
[02:19:12.295 --> 02:19:18.039]  By late summer, if not early fall, it is likely our government will step in and control food and food exports under martial law.
[02:19:18.600 --> 02:19:21.442]  Call Ready Reserve Foods at 1-800-453-2202, 1-800-453-2202 or visit us at www.readyreservefoods.com, 1-800-453-2202.
[02:19:35.709 --> 02:19:39.317]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[02:19:39.638 --> 02:19:43.165]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.
[02:19:43.466 --> 02:19:45.791]  Midas Resources, a team of hand-picked financial

[02:20:36.300 --> 02:20:44.868]  When I learned that the accumulation of acidic waste was the likely cause of my painful joints, lack of energy, and weight gain, I knew I would have to change to a more alkaline diet.
[02:20:45.028 --> 02:20:46.729]  But it just seems so difficult.
[02:20:47.050 --> 02:20:56.518]  Then a friend suggested I try a Jupiter water ionizer from SnyderHealth.com and detox my body even before I changed my diet by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[02:20:56.878 --> 02:20:57.679]  Drinking water?
[02:20:58.160 --> 02:20:59.421]  Now that's something I can handle.
[02:20:59.801 --> 02:21:05.169]  The guys at Snyder Health took the time to explain all of the different options and help me choose the ionizer that was right for me.
[02:21:05.489 --> 02:21:14.483]  I use my new Jupiter ionizer for everything, for drinking, for cooking, and since I've been drinking the water, I have more energy, my joint pains are gone, and I already lost 7 pounds!
[02:21:15.604 --> 02:21:17.265]  And my skin looks great!
[02:21:17.585 --> 02:21:24.407]  Give them a call today at 877-356-2508 to find out which ionizer is right for you.
[02:21:24.607 --> 02:21:27.628]  They offer a full 30-day money-back guarantee and free shipping.
[02:21:27.828 --> 02:21:28.909]  So there's absolutely no risk.
[02:21:28.929 --> 02:21:29.489]  I'm going to skip this.
[02:21:29.509 --> 02:21:32.170]  You can visit them on the web at SnyderHealth.com.
[02:21:32.310 --> 02:21:34.871]  That's SnyderHealth.com.
[02:21:37.757 --> 02:21:43.880]  Alright, we're going to skip the next break if you're an InfoWars.com internet stream listener or PrisonPlanet.tv subscriber.
[02:21:44.280 --> 02:21:47.001]  Everybody else will continue after the next break with Jordan Maxwell.
[02:21:47.321 --> 02:21:51.923]  We're going to go 20 minutes at least into overdrive to take phone calls for Jordan Maxwell.
[02:21:52.343 --> 02:21:54.404]  I'll give you that number at the end of the show.
[02:21:55.865 --> 02:22:03.067]  Okay, Jordan, should we start at the end with the globalist master plan, the New World Order, what they want to build on Earth?
[02:22:03.988 --> 02:22:06.509]  Sometimes that's the best way to start, or should we start at the beginning?
[02:22:07.267 --> 02:22:10.369]  Well, I'll tell you what, start at the beginning, and let me say this.
[02:22:10.609 --> 02:22:16.912]  I don't really want to get into the political part of this, because we don't have a whole lot of time left.
[02:22:17.833 --> 02:22:23.296]  And besides, everyone who needs to know already knows how bad off we are.
[02:22:24.053 --> 02:22:26.754]  I'd like to talk about some subjects that maybe we don't know.
[02:22:26.815 --> 02:22:30.456]  Okay, but I do want to get your take on what their final master plan is.
[02:22:30.476 --> 02:22:36.780]  I mean, I know what your view is, but also I want to get your latest take, your latest analysis on what their endgame is.
[02:22:37.520 --> 02:22:39.301]  But sure, go ahead and start at the beginning.
[02:22:39.821 --> 02:22:46.125]  Okay, well, then everybody should get a piece of paper and a pencil and write down a couple of words I'm going to give you.
[02:22:47.225 --> 02:22:52.508]  Because I believe these are key words to open up a can of worms that you will not believe.
[02:22:53.388 --> 02:22:59.251]  It's going to open up a whole world of research to you that you've never known existed.
[02:23:00.232 --> 02:23:02.933]  The first word is Hanseatic League.
[02:23:03.774 --> 02:23:08.396]  Spell H-A-N-S-E-A-T-I-C.
[02:23:08.916 --> 02:23:10.617]  Hanseatic League.
[02:23:10.797 --> 02:23:12.238]  It's on my website.
[02:23:12.818 --> 02:23:21.543]  If you go to my website and go to the Research Department, it goes to the Research, you will see a box saying, Words to Research.
[02:23:22.324 --> 02:23:27.347]  Go on the Words to Research and check down into the ages and you'll see Hanseatic League.
[02:23:28.548 --> 02:23:33.891]  The Hanseatic League is extremely important to the Illuminati story today.
[02:23:34.792 --> 02:23:44.718]  And connected to the Hanseatic League, which most people don't even know exists, is something called, and write it down, Teutonic Zionism.
[02:23:45.758 --> 02:23:49.681]  It is not Semitic Jewish Zionism, no.
[02:23:50.393 --> 02:23:51.834]  The word is Teutonic.
[02:23:52.014 --> 02:23:56.098]  T-E-U-T-O-N-I-C.
[02:23:56.298 --> 02:24:00.461]  The Teutonic Knights are the German branch of the Knights Templars.
[02:24:00.601 --> 02:24:01.302]  That's right.
[02:24:01.662 --> 02:24:02.983]  That's the name of the tomb.
[02:24:03.043 --> 02:24:05.145]  The Teutonic Zionism.
[02:24:05.925 --> 02:24:11.710]  It's a whole secret order that has been in operation for a thousand years.
[02:24:12.510 --> 02:24:16.774]  It is the whole story behind America, England,
[02:24:17.486 --> 02:24:29.169]  And the things which are going on on the earth today, and if you don't understand Hanseatic League and Teutonic Zionism, you're never going to figure out the name of the tune and how this thing is being played.
[02:24:30.269 --> 02:24:40.812]  And I've been looking at this for 48 years, and I'm telling you that unless and until you have the whole story, you're not going to get to the bottom of anything.
[02:24:40.932 --> 02:24:47.033]  Because like I said in the beginning, the first hour, your decisions in life are only as good as your information.
[02:24:47.603 --> 02:24:52.825]  And the really extraordinary information has never been allowed to be given to the people.
[02:24:53.305 --> 02:24:58.367]  So I'm just getting you started into a truly arcane, occult research.
[02:24:58.467 --> 02:25:01.968]  Well, on the Teutonic Knights, it really grew into the Templars and vice versa.
[02:25:02.148 --> 02:25:02.528]  That's right.
[02:25:02.608 --> 02:25:05.049]  So after they knocked out the Templars, there was still the Teutonic Knights.
[02:25:05.629 --> 02:25:13.452]  I only know about the Teutonic Knights because I read Mein Kampf, I read other books about the Nazis, and Hitler thought that he was creating the recreated
[02:25:14.252 --> 02:25:14.773]  No, you're getting it.
[02:25:14.793 --> 02:25:15.273]  That's exactly right.
[02:25:29.147 --> 02:25:32.591]  The political Zionists, who were supposedly Jewish, were funding Hitler.
[02:25:33.252 --> 02:25:36.976]  Why Hitler allowed Jews to leave to Israel but nowhere else?
[02:25:38.037 --> 02:25:43.043]  Why, at the highest levels, you'll have Zionists right next to top Nazis at Bilderberg?
[02:25:43.083 --> 02:25:43.924]  And it's right.
[02:25:43.964 --> 02:25:49.550]  I've said, when you kick in that final door, it's a room full of Nazis and Kabbalists.
[02:25:50.100 --> 02:25:50.560]  That's right.
[02:25:51.041 --> 02:25:54.943]  That's exactly what I'm saying, and that's why I'm saying you better go back.
[02:25:55.043 --> 02:25:58.145]  And that's what Steven Spielberg is telling us in Renner's The Lost Ark.
[02:25:58.465 --> 02:25:59.986]  He's trying to tell you something.
[02:26:00.166 --> 02:26:01.286]  Twice, the Nazis.
[02:26:01.467 --> 02:26:04.428]  Three times, the last one, the Nazis are in it.
[02:26:04.628 --> 02:26:08.771]  And the first two times, the Nazis are looking for the Lost Ark of the Covenant.
[02:26:09.331 --> 02:26:17.596]  Why would the Nazis care a damn about a Jewish symbol of the Covenant, or the Covenant of the
[02:26:18.246 --> 02:26:19.647]  The Lost Ark of the Covenant.
[02:26:19.987 --> 02:26:24.289]  Why would Nazis care about the Lost Ark of the Covenant, a Jewish symbol?
[02:26:24.770 --> 02:26:29.172]  Why would they care about the Christian symbol of the Holy Grail?
[02:26:30.192 --> 02:26:33.114]  The second one, the Last Crusade.
[02:26:33.754 --> 02:26:42.299]  Why is he putting so much emphasis on the Knights Templars, the Masonic Knights, orders of the Teutonic Knights?
[02:26:43.680 --> 02:26:45.981]  They're trying to tell you something.
[02:26:47.206 --> 02:26:53.107]  And so I'm saying, I've been looking at this for a long time, and I'll tell you what the story is.
[02:26:53.807 --> 02:26:57.728]  Hanseatic League Teutonic Zionism.
[02:26:58.668 --> 02:27:03.149]  It has nothing to do with Jewish Zionism out of the Bible, period.
[02:27:03.269 --> 02:27:04.729]  Nothing Jewish about it.
[02:27:05.629 --> 02:27:14.351]  It has to do with a very ancient, prehistoric, ancient concept of a totalitarian dictatorship
[02:27:14.701 --> 02:27:21.403]  As a matter of fact, if you go to any good law dictionary and look up the word FAS, F-A-S, FAS.
[02:27:22.003 --> 02:27:25.624]  FAS is a Latin word which means God's Law.
[02:27:26.305 --> 02:27:31.886]  You look up in a law dictionary and you will look up the word J-U-S, just.
[02:27:32.547 --> 02:27:39.369]  Just in Latin means man's law, from which we get the idea that man's law is justice.
[02:27:39.569 --> 02:27:43.350]  No, it's a Latin word, J-U-S, meaning man's law.
[02:27:44.321 --> 02:27:48.984]  But God's law is F-A-S, giving us our word, fascism.
[02:27:49.844 --> 02:27:52.305]  Fascism is symbolized by the axe.
[02:27:52.365 --> 02:27:56.948]  The axe has always represented God and the ancient world.
[02:27:57.148 --> 02:28:08.314]  Every ancient civilization ever existed on the earth always used an axe to represent the power of God in the hands of the king.
[02:28:08.334 --> 02:28:12.076]  A fasc is simply a hatchet head.
[02:28:12.671 --> 02:28:13.251]  I don't think so.
[02:28:26.334 --> 02:28:27.234]  Because F.A.S.
[02:28:27.334 --> 02:28:29.335]  in Latin means God's Law.
[02:28:29.375 --> 02:28:44.501]  And that's what's so incredible, that they have the symbols of what we think of as Nazism, the hatchets sticking out of the bound sticks, or showing the Federal Imperium ruling over the slaves, and then you look at them setting up fascism here in the United States.
[02:28:45.041 --> 02:28:45.321]  Yes.
[02:28:46.162 --> 02:28:47.042]  And the people love it.
[02:28:47.182 --> 02:28:49.443]  The people have no idea in the world what's going on.
[02:28:49.463 --> 02:28:50.203]  They don't read.
[02:28:50.943 --> 02:28:55.145]  They don't go to the etymology of words and terms and symbols.
[02:28:55.760 --> 02:29:01.325]  And so, the people who are running this world can do stuff right in front of you.
[02:29:01.405 --> 02:29:10.253]  You know as well as I do, when we were kids, Alex, and the kids are doing it today, the more we change, the more we stay the same.
[02:29:10.773 --> 02:29:21.662]  When we were kids, we could talk on the phone right in front of our parents and talk about stuff that the parents would fall over if they knew that we were talking about, but we were using our own lingo.
[02:29:21.783 --> 02:29:23.384]  We were using our own terms.
[02:29:24.022 --> 02:29:31.528]  And that's what the globalists do.
[02:29:31.568 --> 02:29:37.192]  They have their own language, just like the illegal aliens that the globalists are using to break down our sovereignty.
[02:29:37.472 --> 02:29:45.318]  They love it because on the Spanish radio it's, we're taking over, we're going to kill you, ha ha ha, and then you tell the dumb gringos they can't hear it, they don't know.
[02:29:45.698 --> 02:29:46.579]  That's exactly right.
[02:29:48.567 --> 02:30:10.313]  The elite of this world have their own, look it, you know as well as I do, that if you go to any conference or any seminar given to or by specific disciplines, like you go to a conference of neurosurgeons, they're going to be talking and using terms at that conference that you have no idea in the world what they're talking about.
[02:30:10.733 --> 02:30:13.554]  So you might as well stay home because you're not a neurosurgeon.
[02:30:14.354 --> 02:30:17.275]  If you go to any kind of a conference with specific
[02:30:18.202 --> 02:30:20.424]  Scientists are talking about certain things.
[02:30:20.844 --> 02:30:23.566]  If you're not one of them, you don't know what the words mean.
[02:30:23.706 --> 02:30:24.426]  Okay, here we go.
[02:30:24.727 --> 02:30:35.634]  The main transmission continues right now, Jordan, and then coming up in about 20 minutes, we're going to have to hang up on you and call you back on my studio line, because we're doing this out of my studio, okay?
[02:30:35.774 --> 02:30:36.174]  That's fine.
[02:30:36.194 --> 02:30:36.794]  All right, here we go.
[02:30:53.649 --> 02:30:54.911]  I'm not sure.
[02:31:04.275 --> 02:31:06.436]  We're going to continue into the next hour.
[02:31:06.536 --> 02:31:07.857]  Special Overdrive.
[02:31:07.957 --> 02:31:20.784]  Then when the retransmission continues, I'll get into Barry Jennings, Deputy Head of Emergency Management, New York, talking about explosions in the buildings, dead bodies in Building 7 before either tower collapsed, destroying the 9-11 Commission Report.
[02:31:20.924 --> 02:31:25.066]  Huge video up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[02:31:31.752 --> 02:31:35.414]  This Supreme Court is set to rule that there is no Second Amendment today.
[02:31:36.754 --> 02:31:39.716]  But in lawyer speak, they're going to say it's a victory for the Second Amendment.
[02:31:41.236 --> 02:31:43.497]  They're not allowed to totally ban guns in D.C.
[02:31:44.018 --> 02:31:48.880]  Now they have to go back and pass a new law that just basically restricts them to nothing, but it has to be done by law.
[02:31:49.896 --> 02:31:50.737]  That's what they're going to do.
[02:31:51.217 --> 02:31:55.360]  They've already said they're going to do it, and you're going to watch them do it, and that way it neutralizes people.
[02:31:55.420 --> 02:31:58.002]  It's all about deception, all about word games.
[02:31:58.022 --> 02:31:59.042]  They play so many.
[02:31:59.703 --> 02:32:06.127]  They've trained whole cadres of people, compartmentalized to carry out the lies, but they don't see the larger part of how they're destroying themselves.
[02:32:06.507 --> 02:32:08.969]  We'll be back with Jordan Maxwell in just one moment.
[02:32:09.329 --> 02:32:14.252]  Be sure to visit his website, JordanMaxwell.com, and let's just go 30 more minutes into the next hour.
[02:32:14.272 --> 02:32:19.476]  He says he's feeling good and can do it, and we're going to be taking your phone calls coming up in the next hour, but not yet.
[02:32:20.436 --> 02:32:22.977]  We'll get that number out at the end of the main radio broadcast.
[02:32:23.257 --> 02:32:27.219]  It'll be internet only for the last 30 minutes with Jordan Maxwell.
[02:32:28.059 --> 02:32:32.180]  Before we go back to Jordan, this show is made possible by our sponsors.
[02:32:32.501 --> 02:32:35.842]  And one of those sponsors is eFoods Direct.
[02:32:36.862 --> 02:32:41.664]  eFoods Direct is the longest continually operating storable food company in the United States.
[02:32:41.704 --> 02:32:43.625]  They have freeze-dried and dehydrated food.
[02:32:43.985 --> 02:32:52.849]  That means it's high-quality, keeps its nutritive value, it's non-GMO, clean, healthy food, balanced, and it is in cans.
[02:32:53.289 --> 02:32:59.652]  So it stores for more than 10 years in climate-controlled, 10 years non-climate-controlled, and it stores in very small areas.
[02:32:59.692 --> 02:33:00.673]  Each can is very heavy.
[02:33:00.693 --> 02:33:01.453]  It's jam-packed.
[02:33:02.682 --> 02:33:10.511]  Very inexpensive, and with all the food price increases, the talk of depression, it's just good insurance to have storable food.
[02:33:10.691 --> 02:33:11.051]  I do.
[02:33:11.071 --> 02:33:20.401]  I bought from several other companies, didn't really like them, bought from these guys, liked them six, seven years ago, bought from them four times, bought family food, and done a lot more.
[02:33:21.302 --> 02:33:32.225]  So, 1-800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com, Big Fat Banners at the top of Infowars.com, and prisonplanet.com.
[02:33:33.105 --> 02:33:36.186]  Also, there's the great folks at Inner Health Botanicals.
[02:33:36.746 --> 02:33:43.869]  They're one of the most long-operating and most respected mineral and supplement companies out there.
[02:33:43.889 --> 02:33:45.069]  They don't make magic claims.
[02:33:45.669 --> 02:33:50.552]  They have the well-documented herbs and medicines that have been known to have nutritive and health effects for thousands of years.
[02:33:51.093 --> 02:33:54.515]  Like aloe vera for flushing out your intestines and detoxifying.
[02:33:54.855 --> 02:33:56.436]  Concentrated aloe vera tablets.
[02:33:56.476 --> 02:33:58.158]  It's the equivalent of drinking gallons of the stuff.
[02:33:58.918 --> 02:34:01.420]  And it's got other herbs that are known for cleaning out your guts.
[02:34:01.440 --> 02:34:02.000]  1-800-569-4056.
[02:34:02.020 --> 02:34:02.100]  1-800-569-4056.
[02:34:02.120 --> 02:34:02.881]  Aloes, colon, body cleanse.
[02:34:02.901 --> 02:34:04.042]  Another one of their products.
[02:34:10.993 --> 02:34:13.895]  Super Beta Prostate with Palmetto and other things.
[02:34:14.736 --> 02:34:18.318]  Most men start having problems with their prostate after 45 and don't find out until they're 60.
[02:34:19.179 --> 02:34:22.461]  These are things that are well known to shrink it to have some effect to help you.
[02:34:23.102 --> 02:34:23.982]  Are they a magic cure?
[02:34:24.042 --> 02:34:24.283]  No.
[02:34:24.323 --> 02:34:24.863]  Do they help?
[02:34:24.943 --> 02:34:25.223]  Yes.
[02:34:25.243 --> 02:34:25.564]  1-800-569-4056.
[02:34:25.744 --> 02:34:29.747]  Even medical doctors are now prescribing this.
[02:34:29.767 --> 02:34:30.287]  1-800-569-4056.
[02:34:30.307 --> 02:34:31.208]  BigFatManor on Infowars.com.
[02:34:35.991 --> 02:34:39.038]  Okay, going back to Jordan Maxwell.
[02:34:39.058 --> 02:34:42.084]  He was talking about the Teutonic Zionist.
[02:34:43.327 --> 02:34:46.533]  And again, separately from Jordan Maxwell, because I've been a big reader.
[02:34:48.354 --> 02:34:59.465]  I can confirm what he's saying because I happen to read Heinz Hobel, Order of the Deathshead, Scheer's Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, two of Hitler's books, Mein Kampf and then the New World Order.
[02:35:00.766 --> 02:35:03.128]  I happen to know that they believed in Teutonic Knights.
[02:35:03.289 --> 02:35:04.850]  This predates the Templars.
[02:35:05.631 --> 02:35:08.133]  Mainstream history teaches you the Templars became the Teutonics.
[02:35:09.252 --> 02:35:19.699]  Really, they were the tree from which the Templars rose, and when that tree was cut down and ran to northern England or to Scotland, the real heart of it grew back up.
[02:35:19.819 --> 02:35:21.640]  Am I correct in saying that, Jordan?
[02:35:21.940 --> 02:35:22.781]  Yeah, I think you're right.
[02:35:22.861 --> 02:35:28.084]  I think you're right, because the Teutonic thing goes way back into ancient history, way back.
[02:35:29.745 --> 02:35:30.026]  Yes.
[02:35:30.106 --> 02:35:32.867]  So, yeah, that's a whole study in itself.
[02:35:32.908 --> 02:35:38.131]  That's why I said, put the two together, the Teutonic Zionism, which is
[02:35:39.497 --> 02:35:44.639]  Semitic Zionism, it's Teutonic Zionism, and Hanseatic League.
[02:35:44.679 --> 02:35:49.540]  And again, the word is H-A-N-S-E-A-T-I-C.
[02:35:50.001 --> 02:35:56.983]  Hanseatic League and Teutonic Zionism will begin to open up a can of worms that you're not going to believe.
[02:35:57.063 --> 02:35:58.844]  Well, tell us about the Hanseatic League.
[02:35:59.364 --> 02:36:08.367]  Well, it's a league of German bankers and thinkers, philosophers, but especially bankers and commercial
[02:36:09.008 --> 02:36:09.309]  I don't
[02:36:23.908 --> 02:36:29.150]  Thinkers, philosophers, who were basically... They created the modern education system.
[02:36:29.190 --> 02:36:30.771]  They created the PhD.
[02:36:31.111 --> 02:36:32.231]  That's it.
[02:36:32.371 --> 02:36:33.892]  They engineered the whole society.
[02:36:33.932 --> 02:36:35.012]  They created NASA.
[02:36:35.272 --> 02:36:36.673]  They created our CIA.
[02:36:36.953 --> 02:36:39.794]  They merged with the British-German aristocracy.
[02:36:40.474 --> 02:36:44.315]  And again, I'm not absolving the modern, corrupt, murderous Zionists.
[02:36:44.576 --> 02:36:47.957]  The point is, I have found that they are actually their plaything.
[02:36:48.837 --> 02:36:58.760]  And that they have intermarried in with the Rothschilds, and every time I knock down that final door, this is a Germanic death cult that believes they are the true Zionists.
[02:36:59.100 --> 02:36:59.580]  That's it.
[02:36:59.680 --> 02:37:01.721]  That's the name of the tune, and you said it all.
[02:37:01.941 --> 02:37:02.341]  That's it.
[02:37:02.481 --> 02:37:03.281]  So let's move on.
[02:37:03.322 --> 02:37:07.683]  But I mean, all I try to do though is report what I really find in history.
[02:37:08.343 --> 02:37:08.663]  I know.
[02:37:08.703 --> 02:37:11.946]  And I mean, look at who owns the big pharma companies, look at who owns the military.
[02:37:12.626 --> 02:37:22.693]  And then it's got to be a debate about the Catholics, or it's got to be a debate about the... But then the Catholic system, you know, is trying to set up the new Rome, and it's hooked in with the Teutonics, is it not?
[02:37:22.713 --> 02:37:23.834]  Oh, of course it is.
[02:37:23.854 --> 02:37:24.574]  Of course it is.
[02:37:24.675 --> 02:37:27.336]  But then I say it's only part of it.
[02:37:27.677 --> 02:37:29.798]  I mean, I'm saying Zionists, Catholics, all of it.
[02:37:29.838 --> 02:37:30.519]  The Protestants?
[02:37:30.819 --> 02:37:35.442]  But see, no, they want to keep us compartmentalized, divided, and conquered, don't they?
[02:37:35.562 --> 02:37:35.962]  You're right.
[02:37:36.283 --> 02:37:36.623]  You're right.
[02:37:36.983 --> 02:37:43.246]  That's why I was saying earlier, when you go on my website, there are three books that are showing.
[02:37:43.406 --> 02:37:49.928]  I have other e-books that, once you hit one of the books that are showing, it will take you to the whole e-book section.
[02:37:49.988 --> 02:37:58.952]  But the one in the middle is called Symbols, Sex, and the Stars, which I was so taken by when I first found this book in an old bookstore.
[02:37:59.032 --> 02:38:01.413]  I was just absolutely mesmerized by it.
[02:38:01.914 --> 02:38:12.724]  How much information is in there so well easily to read and explain about where things come from in the world theology?
[02:38:12.824 --> 02:38:14.106]  Where it developed?
[02:38:14.526 --> 02:38:15.607]  What the words meant?
[02:38:15.647 --> 02:38:21.012]  The etymology of the words and where the concepts and ideas have come from.
[02:38:21.032 --> 02:38:22.874]  It's called Symbols, Sects, and the Stars.
[02:38:23.474 --> 02:38:26.157]  I own the copyright on that.
[02:38:26.257 --> 02:38:27.238]  I gave it to my friend
[02:38:27.765 --> 02:38:28.825]  So he could publish it.
[02:38:28.965 --> 02:38:38.627]  And then the second one, which was so extraordinarily important, I asked and got the copyright to own it also.
[02:38:38.767 --> 02:38:43.828]  I not only loved the books, I wanted to own them, so I could put them out all over the world.
[02:38:44.388 --> 02:38:47.668]  It's called Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy.
[02:38:48.409 --> 02:38:57.110]  And once you understand how Masonic Astronomy, and is connected to the Stellar Theology of the ancient world,
[02:38:58.067 --> 02:39:04.972]  Then all of the words and terms you're hearing in religion and philosophy and astronomy all begin to make sense.
[02:39:04.992 --> 02:39:09.194]  And that's why the Olympics this year are going to be on 888 at 888 in the day.
[02:39:09.675 --> 02:39:16.859]  That's why NASA did the shoots on certain days at certain times, admittedly occultic.
[02:39:17.320 --> 02:39:20.502]  That's why Ronald Reagan only gave speeches in an exact second.
[02:39:20.922 --> 02:39:28.226]  On an exact day with a certain color tie, looking a certain direction, and would walk out and hail his arms in an occultic fashion before he did it.
[02:39:28.546 --> 02:39:29.987]  That's why Bill Clinton's upset.
[02:39:30.087 --> 02:39:31.288]  They really believe this.
[02:39:31.948 --> 02:39:34.410]  And they believe, by extension, all the power they have.
[02:39:34.450 --> 02:39:35.290]  They believe it's real.
[02:39:35.610 --> 02:39:37.611]  And they believe they're communing with entities, don't they?
[02:39:38.032 --> 02:39:39.152]  That's exactly right.
[02:39:39.472 --> 02:39:43.435]  And the mere fact, I mean, you know, by their fruits you shall know them.
[02:39:43.975 --> 02:39:47.497]  The mere fact that they are the power tells you that
[02:39:48.086 --> 02:39:51.968]  There very well might be something, in fact, legitimate about it.
[02:39:52.548 --> 02:40:06.256]  That there very well might be an occult, hidden, dark force in the universe that we call the occult magical system that we put into movies like Matrix.
[02:40:07.031 --> 02:40:15.533]  But there is, in point of fact, a legitimate, de jure, real, magical system operating on the earth.
[02:40:15.653 --> 02:40:34.237]  Now, let's be clear, for atheists out there, if you go research your atheistic founders, you will find they're funded by a cultic and theophics, you know, different societies, and that the world leaders who are telling you not to believe anything, they are obsessed with this, aren't they?
[02:40:34.717 --> 02:40:35.338]  Absolutely.
[02:40:35.478 --> 02:40:36.178]  No doubt about it.
[02:40:36.439 --> 02:40:38.740]  And Washington, D.C.
[02:40:38.860 --> 02:40:41.242]  is just filled with occult symbolism.
[02:40:41.282 --> 02:40:42.223]  Oh, it's everywhere.
[02:40:42.823 --> 02:40:43.344]  Everywhere.
[02:40:44.185 --> 02:40:58.956]  We go to the Washington Monument, and you know how many people go to the Washington Monument and see the Washington Monument and are so proud to stand there and have a picture taken with the Washington Monument, never realizing that the Washington Monument
[02:40:59.381 --> 02:41:03.784]  As a phallic symbol for the phallic worship in Egypt.
[02:41:03.864 --> 02:41:05.325]  Or all these Baptist churches.
[02:41:05.385 --> 02:41:09.668]  I mean, you'll tell a Baptist preacher that and he'll giggle and laugh and wink at you, because most of them are Masons.
[02:41:10.089 --> 02:41:10.509]  That's right.
[02:41:10.629 --> 02:41:11.630]  I mean, they know.
[02:41:11.650 --> 02:41:12.711]  It's funny to them.
[02:41:13.491 --> 02:41:20.836]  Look, I've had so many people contact me, emails and phone, asking me, well, what about this?
[02:41:20.896 --> 02:41:22.417]  And what can you tell me about that?
[02:41:22.497 --> 02:41:23.558]  Well, I'm just one man.
[02:41:23.598 --> 02:41:25.860]  I can't talk to the whole world one man at a time.
[02:41:26.460 --> 02:41:28.742]  But when people call me and ask me,
[02:41:30.085 --> 02:41:33.468]  I tell them, look, I've had a website for 15 years.
[02:41:34.108 --> 02:41:37.151]  I've had stuff on that one subject you just asked me about.
[02:41:37.671 --> 02:41:43.896]  In my research department, did you go to the research boxes on my website?
[02:41:43.996 --> 02:41:44.196]  No.
[02:41:44.737 --> 02:41:47.259]  Well, did you go to the links on my website?
[02:41:47.339 --> 02:41:47.559]  No.
[02:41:48.200 --> 02:41:52.864]  Did you see the pictures and the downloadable documents?
[02:41:52.964 --> 02:41:53.204]  No.
[02:41:54.025 --> 02:41:56.807]  Well, did you get any of the e-books that were there?
[02:41:56.927 --> 02:41:58.108]  No, I didn't see any e-books.
[02:41:58.638 --> 02:42:16.263]  So I want to take this opportunity to say, anyone who goes on my website, understand there is at least 48 years of knowledge and work that I have put into my website of stuff that you will never be privy to know even exist.
[02:42:17.023 --> 02:42:22.804]  So when you go to my website, don't just look at the homepage and a couple of pictures, go all through it.
[02:42:22.944 --> 02:42:25.565]  And especially on the audio video page,
[02:42:26.375 --> 02:42:29.557]  And the links page, I've got stuff on links pages.
[02:42:29.577 --> 02:42:33.199]  I don't put links on my website to take up room.
[02:42:33.379 --> 02:42:36.280]  I put them on because they are very important to me.
[02:42:36.900 --> 02:42:39.462]  Now Jordan, I want to move quickly here.
[02:42:39.762 --> 02:42:43.264]  You also told me privately that you may not be doing radio much longer.
[02:42:43.344 --> 02:42:47.366]  Two Sundays from now, you're going to be joining us for the full two hours.
[02:42:48.506 --> 02:42:54.649]  And if you really are talking about hanging up your hat here, I want to get you up even sooner back on this show.
[02:42:54.709 --> 02:43:00.712]  I mean, you say you're ill, you don't feel well, you're losing the drive, but I hear that drive reigniting once we get you on air.
[02:43:01.412 --> 02:43:03.794]  Any ballpark on when you may hang it up?
[02:43:04.394 --> 02:43:11.197]  I get excited in my spirit when I'm in the company of someone like yourself, Alex, that appreciates
[02:43:13.590 --> 02:43:13.910]  I don't
[02:43:26.102 --> 02:43:30.067]  of seeing things people are saying about me which are not true.
[02:43:30.087 --> 02:43:33.471]  They're saying that I'm an enemy of so-and-so.
[02:43:33.491 --> 02:43:34.692]  You shouldn't let them get to you.
[02:43:34.712 --> 02:43:35.733]  They're mad.
[02:43:35.753 --> 02:43:39.818]  You're getting flat because you're over the target, Jordan, and people are jealous of you.
[02:43:39.838 --> 02:43:42.301]  They try to stir up fights.
[02:43:42.801 --> 02:43:43.943]  You've done a lot of great work.
[02:43:43.963 --> 02:43:46.425]  You're still doing great work, and if they know they're getting to you,
[02:43:46.906 --> 02:43:48.447]  They're only going to go 10 times crazier.
[02:43:48.467 --> 02:43:52.249]  And look, I got people threatening me and threatening my family, and I know it's happened to you.
[02:43:52.309 --> 02:43:55.891]  You got people banging on your doors, saying they're going to kill you and the cops won't help you.
[02:43:56.451 --> 02:43:57.732]  I understand all that's happening.
[02:43:57.752 --> 02:44:02.554]  That's why we've got you here, to try to get you support, but don't let them get you down.
[02:44:02.614 --> 02:44:06.076]  I mean, I know you're 70-something years old and got cancer, so it's easy for me.
[02:44:06.656 --> 02:44:07.997]  Well, I'll tell you what really
[02:44:32.449 --> 02:44:33.810]  It bothers me terribly.
[02:44:33.990 --> 02:44:42.238]  I mean I'll just tell you personally what really hurts me is the fact that I haven't even begun to tell the people who want to know.
[02:44:42.839 --> 02:44:45.380]  I haven't even begun to scrape the surface of what I really have.
[02:44:45.420 --> 02:44:46.420]  I know the frustration.
[02:44:46.480 --> 02:44:47.320]  I have the same feeling.
[02:44:47.501 --> 02:44:49.041]  There's 50 films I want to make.
[02:44:49.061 --> 02:45:00.305]  There's all these complex issues I want to expose, and then I make a film like Endgame that cost me $150,000 to make, and people watched it and appreciated it, but I know it hasn't gotten the attention it needs.
[02:45:00.345 --> 02:45:06.146]  This is life-saving information, and people just kind of like, oh, you put it on the web for free?
[02:45:06.487 --> 02:45:07.687]  I don't even care to watch it.
[02:45:08.047 --> 02:45:09.768]  You know, it's like you pour your guts out.
[02:45:09.808 --> 02:45:11.749]  You don't sleep making something.
[02:45:11.769 --> 02:45:14.030]  You go through hell to make it, and they don't understand.
[02:45:14.090 --> 02:45:16.091]  It's pearls before swine sometimes.
[02:45:16.451 --> 02:45:22.194]  Absolutely, and consequently, but the powers that be know that you're putting it out, and they're going to deal with you.
[02:45:22.435 --> 02:45:34.641]  You're going to have your family and threats against your life, and threats against your home, and you're dealing, you're fighting something on the front lines, while other people are just viewing your work as entertainment.
[02:45:35.214 --> 02:45:47.037]  So many people will listen to me and watch videos which I've never put any... That's right, one of the biggest comic book companies has put out a whole line of comic books called New World Order and they are giving you credit, Jordan.
[02:45:47.577 --> 02:45:54.038]  You know, I know that comic book company did because I think they had to, lawfully they had to because it was based on me.
[02:45:55.338 --> 02:45:57.799]  But you know, if you go on my website to the
[02:45:58.840 --> 02:45:59.740]  To the e-books.
[02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:02.141]  Those free e-books are very, very important.
[02:46:02.181 --> 02:46:03.921]  That's why I put them on the homepage.
[02:46:03.962 --> 02:46:07.623]  And of course, I have another box called Endorsements and Emails.
[02:46:07.643 --> 02:46:12.344]  A lot of interesting stuff on there that people have sent me.
[02:46:12.424 --> 02:46:13.884]  And I just put it out in the public.
[02:46:13.944 --> 02:46:16.605]  So I'll let you see what other people have sent me.
[02:46:16.665 --> 02:46:18.346]  Then Downloadable Documents.
[02:46:19.266 --> 02:46:20.246]  The Photo Gallery.
[02:46:20.306 --> 02:46:22.787]  And of course, just general research boxes.
[02:46:22.887 --> 02:46:26.228]  I've got tons of stuff on there, but what really bothers me
[02:46:26.889 --> 02:46:33.690]  Is that I would love to be able to do radio and talk to the world and tell the world what I really know.
[02:46:34.778 --> 02:46:36.319]  Well, why don't we have you back up?
[02:46:36.439 --> 02:46:42.683]  Why don't we have you back up later in the week for like two hours to really... You can say whatever you want here, Jordan.
[02:46:42.743 --> 02:46:43.524]  It's a big audience.
[02:46:44.345 --> 02:46:45.485]  Millions of people, as you know.
[02:46:45.525 --> 02:46:56.313]  But before we go to this final break for the main show and then call you back on my studio line for an internet cast with... Millions will see it in the next few months but tens of thousands listening and watching right now.
[02:46:57.233 --> 02:47:01.396]  But I want to talk about two things before this main show ends in about eight minutes.
[02:47:02.457 --> 02:47:03.357]  And that is this.
[02:47:05.060 --> 02:47:07.862]  A, how does their command and control structure work?
[02:47:07.882 --> 02:47:12.685]  I mean, we know it's a philosophy, it's a pyramid, it's different lower levels of compartmentalization.
[02:47:12.945 --> 02:47:16.628]  A, but I mean, you know, from a city up to the national level, international.
[02:47:17.428 --> 02:47:19.490]  And then B, their master plan.
[02:47:19.630 --> 02:47:25.694]  If they're able to get everything they want built and done, which it looks like they're able to do, what will it finally look like?
[02:47:25.814 --> 02:47:29.836]  When will they go ahead and wipe out 90% of us, or what's the time frame on that?
[02:47:29.896 --> 02:47:33.759]  In fact, let's cover that first, and we're going to skip this break for InfoWars.com listeners.
[02:47:34.491 --> 02:47:36.632]  Okay, you want to talk about it now?
[02:47:36.652 --> 02:47:39.393]  Yeah, let's talk about their master plan if they win.
[02:47:41.214 --> 02:47:52.380]  Well, I think the human race, and this is going to be a painting with a very broad brush, but it's based on many years of looking at the subject from every conceivable angle.
[02:47:52.560 --> 02:48:00.224]  And I've traveled all around the world, from Egypt to Europe to quite literally around the world, talking to people.
[02:48:00.811 --> 02:48:05.814]  Lecturing on this subject, and I've learned so much from others in other areas of the world.
[02:48:05.834 --> 02:48:13.498]  It's very rewarding to travel and hear other foreign people, what they think, and see how things work in their country.
[02:48:13.598 --> 02:48:20.582]  And I'm totally convinced that the human race is being mutated according to a scientific method.
[02:48:21.322 --> 02:48:26.525]  We know that there have been experiments done as far back as the 1920s and 30s
[02:48:28.887 --> 02:48:55.070]  uh... of trying to crossbreed animals with humans the germans were doing that uh... there was movies made back in nineteen thirty eight thirty nine with charles lawton uh... called uh... the island of lost souls nineteen sixty-five burt lancaster remade a call the island of dr moran let me stop you and back up what you're saying in game starts getting into this in game two or whatever i'm gonna call it will fully get into it
[02:48:56.098 --> 02:48:59.319]  But all the main eugenicists, Margaret Sanger, H.G.
[02:48:59.380 --> 02:49:24.651]  Wells, the princes, Prince Bernhardt, said they're going to make two different species, and then BBC, while I was making the film, showed this little goblin creature that we're going to be, and then they're going to be these beautiful blonde-haired, blue-eyed people, and they hate us so much, they want to make themselves better than us, so they actively want to kill most of us, and then have a clown goblin creature that they call the old humans that they laugh at.
[02:49:25.475 --> 02:49:26.435]  That's exactly right.
[02:49:26.596 --> 02:49:27.756]  That's what I was getting to.
[02:49:27.796 --> 02:49:28.536]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:49:28.556 --> 02:49:34.920]  I wanted to back up what you're saying because that is, so all of your research comes to the fact, we know the GMO foods changing our genetics.
[02:49:35.200 --> 02:49:38.181]  We know we're genetically getting dumber, not just chemically.
[02:49:38.201 --> 02:49:39.142]  Go ahead.
[02:49:39.162 --> 02:49:40.282]  This is massive, folks.
[02:49:40.742 --> 02:49:41.243]  That's right.
[02:49:41.443 --> 02:49:43.724]  That's what I've been looking at for 48 years.
[02:49:43.744 --> 02:49:52.568]  The complete transformation and transmutation of the human spirit into a whole new kind of creature.
[02:49:53.866 --> 02:50:04.633]  This gets into a subject which I have been fascinated with all my life, about how to cross-breed animals and humans, and don't think it hasn't happened.
[02:50:05.073 --> 02:50:06.294]  Oh, they now admit they've done it!
[02:50:06.314 --> 02:50:09.636]  They now admit human-chimpanzee clones, human-cow clones.
[02:50:10.236 --> 02:50:10.816]  Absolutely.
[02:50:10.856 --> 02:50:11.757]  Oh my God, yeah.
[02:50:12.317 --> 02:50:20.622]  And we know that the Germans were working on this as far back as the 1920s, and of course Ivan G. Pavlov and
[02:50:21.261 --> 02:50:32.570]  AR Luria and Pavlov were working with their Pavlonian dogs, understanding how to cause people to think what they want, you know.
[02:50:33.070 --> 02:50:48.802]  That whole Pavlonian dog thing was part of the whole eugenics program to completely redesign the human being so that one day, ultimately one day, the human race will be so profoundly stupid
[02:50:49.310 --> 02:50:51.260]  And so awesomely ignorant.
[02:50:51.826 --> 02:51:01.270]  That they will just eat and reproduce and... But that's what George Orwell said in 1984 by removing the language with chemicals.
[02:51:01.590 --> 02:51:03.471]  That's what Brave New World is about.
[02:51:03.511 --> 02:51:06.052]  And Huxley said, look, my brother runs UNESCO.
[02:51:06.332 --> 02:51:07.372]  This book is real.
[02:51:07.632 --> 02:51:09.793]  This is what the eugenicists are doing to you.
[02:51:10.553 --> 02:51:14.215]  And they've already got us almost trapped where they're drinking poison fluoride.
[02:51:14.235 --> 02:51:15.415]  They're taking the injections.
[02:51:15.756 --> 02:51:17.636]  They're laughing at us while they do it.
[02:51:19.717 --> 02:51:20.978]  Oh my God, this is so incredible.
[02:51:20.998 --> 02:51:24.379]  Jordan, I'm going to let you go in about three minutes, and we're going to call you back.
[02:51:26.080 --> 02:51:28.341]  As soon as we hang up on you, we're going to call you right back.
[02:51:28.381 --> 02:51:30.362]  But we're going back to the main show right now.
[02:51:30.402 --> 02:51:30.822]  Here we go.
[02:51:40.647 --> 02:51:45.189]  I was a highwayman, along the coach roads I did ride.
[02:51:50.340 --> 02:51:59.408]  In my gut, in my psyche, the full power of my subconscious mind, thousands of times more powerful than my limited cerebral cortex.
[02:52:00.148 --> 02:52:03.331]  In my bones, I know they're waging war against the species.
[02:52:04.929 --> 02:52:07.231]  And then, lo and behold, I go to their own documents.
[02:52:07.732 --> 02:52:12.617]  They vitriolically say they're poisoning us, killing us, euthanizing us right now.
[02:52:13.278 --> 02:52:15.640]  With the nutrition we've been getting, we should be living to 130.
[02:52:15.700 --> 02:52:23.309]  They are waging war on us, and I, you know, hadn't even got into Jordan Maxwell's own research on this, and I say, what's the master plan?
[02:52:23.849 --> 02:52:32.836]  And he says to dumb us down into a new suboid species, and you read the eugenicists, you read the government plans, they are now doing it, inserting us into a matrix.
[02:52:33.136 --> 02:52:37.820]  You're being sucked into your iPhones, sucked into your video games, you're already interfacing.
[02:52:39.100 --> 02:52:46.066]  I've got to have you up very soon, Jordan, to do a whole show on this and how they admit they're doing it.
[02:52:46.506 --> 02:52:49.809]  And I've had elitists tell me, Alex, you warned them, and look, they don't even care.
[02:52:50.549 --> 02:52:51.810]  That's the ultimate cop-out.
[02:52:51.850 --> 02:52:55.993]  They have done everything for generations to dumb us down and to turn us into this.
[02:52:56.013 --> 02:53:01.237]  The National Banking Association, a hundred years ago, put out memos saying, buy up the media, dumb everybody down.
[02:53:01.557 --> 02:53:02.598]  They're reading too much.
[02:53:02.658 --> 02:53:04.900]  They're chemically attacking all of you.
[02:53:05.600 --> 02:53:13.727]  This is their own admissions, and Jordan, we're going to call you back in just a moment on your line because we're going to end the show, the main show.
[02:53:13.987 --> 02:53:21.434]  We're going to do 30 more minutes with you, but in closing, I want to thank you for coming on the main show, and I want to ask everybody to visit JordanMaxwell.com.
[02:53:21.774 --> 02:53:23.956]  Anything else in closing you want to say to the main audience?
[02:53:24.297 --> 02:53:29.141]  Yes, the material that's on my website is there for the moment.
[02:53:29.640 --> 02:53:33.565]  So you need to understand, it may not be there tomorrow.
[02:53:33.805 --> 02:53:38.691]  So you better get whatever's on there, because I'm always under attack, always.
[02:53:38.791 --> 02:53:41.234]  My website is being cut down, shut down.
[02:53:41.874 --> 02:53:48.777]  So I'm just saying, go on my website to JordanMaxwell.com and get whatever you can now because who knows what tomorrow is going to bring.
[02:53:48.917 --> 02:53:52.198]  Are you for people taking this stuff and creating mirrors of it?
[02:53:52.898 --> 02:53:53.539]  Oh, I don't care.
[02:53:53.559 --> 02:53:54.759]  I couldn't care less.
[02:53:54.979 --> 02:53:57.480]  Okay, well we'll create a mirror and then point at it for you then.
[02:53:58.040 --> 02:54:01.802]  And then all my visitors can come check out what you're doing and get your books and videos.
[02:54:02.182 --> 02:54:05.984]  Jordan, we're going to call you right back here in just one minute.
[02:54:06.004 --> 02:54:10.085]  So take a two minute break and the phone will ring and we'll do 30 more minutes and take calls, okay?
[02:54:10.365 --> 02:54:10.726]  I told.
[02:54:11.006 --> 02:54:11.706]  Okay, bye bye.
[02:54:11.766 --> 02:54:12.086]  Thank you.
[02:54:12.126 --> 02:54:13.367]  There goes Jordan Maxwell.
[02:54:13.407 --> 02:54:21.152]  For Genesis listeners, our wonderful AM and FM and shortwave and all the affiliates, satellite, the show ends in three minutes, two and a half minutes.
[02:54:21.773 --> 02:54:23.974]  There's only one place to listen to the rest of Jordan Maxwell.
[02:54:24.275 --> 02:54:26.176]  That's InfoWars.com.
[02:54:26.476 --> 02:54:28.998]  That's a different internet streaming you find on the network or other places.
[02:54:29.358 --> 02:54:30.459]  That's where the show reloops.
[02:54:30.559 --> 02:54:32.140]  When we go into overdrive, it's still live.
[02:54:32.540 --> 02:54:34.862]  So right now, InfoWars.com.
[02:54:35.202 --> 02:54:39.045]  You have to go to those streams to get the rest, the final thirty minutes.
[02:54:39.585 --> 02:54:44.608]  Commercial-free with Jordan Maxwell at InfoWars.com right now.
[02:54:45.208 --> 02:54:46.609]  Also, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:54:46.629 --> 02:54:51.511]  You can watch streaming live right now for the next 30 minutes, and then we'll also archive that this afternoon for everybody else.
[02:54:51.872 --> 02:54:54.453]  An amazing interview with Jordan Maxwell.
[02:54:54.753 --> 02:54:56.194]  People kept saying, get Jordan Maxwell on.
[02:54:56.214 --> 02:54:56.934]  I tried to get him on.
[02:54:56.954 --> 02:54:59.316]  He said he wasn't doing interviews anymore, and then he graciously came on.
[02:54:59.696 --> 02:55:00.436]  So here he is.
[02:55:00.756 --> 02:55:03.978]  He's on, and he'll be on more in the next few weeks with us.
[02:55:05.959 --> 02:55:13.126]  I do want to tell all of you that Truth Rising, the people taking action, waking up to 9-11, exposing that lie, can expose the rest.

[02:56:17.291 --> 02:56:17.912]  Alright, John.
[02:56:18.072 --> 02:56:19.072]  Thanks a million, brother.
[02:56:19.152 --> 02:56:20.353]  Perfect job on the show.
[02:56:20.794 --> 02:56:22.254]  I will see you back live tomorrow.
[02:56:22.575 --> 02:56:23.175]  Thank you, sir.
[02:56:23.215 --> 02:56:24.136]  Good job as usual.
[02:56:24.596 --> 02:56:25.397]  Thank you, my friend.
[02:56:25.417 --> 02:56:26.057]  We'll see you tomorrow.
[02:56:26.217 --> 02:56:26.837]  Alright, take care.
[02:56:50.704 --> 02:56:53.225]  Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 exposé.
[02:56:53.505 --> 02:56:55.206]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[02:56:55.246 --> 02:56:58.067]  military bases to bombs in the buildings...
[02:57:30.768 --> 02:57:33.490]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're now into overdrive.
[02:57:33.550 --> 02:57:35.011]  Haven't done one of these in about a month.
[02:57:36.472 --> 02:57:39.654]  Jordan Maxwell, jordanmaxwell.com, was with us for another 30 minutes.
[02:57:40.919 --> 02:57:43.981]  And I want to set him up in the near future.
[02:57:44.021 --> 02:57:46.802]  In fact, Jordan, do you have your book in front of you?
[02:57:47.083 --> 02:57:47.483]  Yes, sir.
[02:57:47.743 --> 02:58:06.274]  When would you like to come back on, this is too important to wait, to get more into the Teutonic Nazi Zionist New World Order grid, and talk more about their master plan of turning a minority of us into animal slave suboids, a genetically engineered sub-slave species,
[02:58:07.174 --> 02:58:11.840]  Well, I'll tell you what, let me think about that and then we'll talk off the air.
[02:58:11.900 --> 02:58:14.202]  I'll call you back if not today, tomorrow.
[02:58:28.507 --> 02:58:32.888]  I'll think about it and we'll discuss that privately then.
[02:58:48.072 --> 02:58:48.312]  I think?
[02:59:05.371 --> 02:59:29.912]  philosophy, whether it's a Chinese communist commander or a German bank owner or the Rothschilds, they all are adherents and worship this Teutonic slash Zionist system, and as you said, nothing to do with the Jews, and that's evidence mainstream history about Hitler was obsessed with Kabbalah and all the rest of it, and now Madonna and everybody else's, that's a part of it,
[02:59:31.109 --> 02:59:40.173]  But I want to spend five minutes before we take calls on their game plan currently and what you think we're going to see in the next few years.
[02:59:40.633 --> 02:59:46.136]  And then more on their master plan, how you see them implementing.
[02:59:46.596 --> 02:59:50.577]  They're coming out with laws now of if you've got a genetic disorder, you can't have children.
[02:59:50.638 --> 02:59:51.738]  They say what an order is.
[02:59:52.018 --> 02:59:54.199]  They're going to drug half the kids in the schools.
[02:59:54.479 --> 02:59:55.820]  They're admittedly drugging the water.
[02:59:56.620 --> 03:00:01.584]  I mean, they're hitting us from every angle, and then any ideas you have of us struggling out of this?
[03:00:02.825 --> 03:00:22.501]  Well, I'm at a loss for words, because it's such a huge tsunami of ignorance that's sweeping the world, and an avalanche of attack on the human species by these people at the very top.
[03:00:25.260 --> 03:00:29.803]  It's like I was saying before, it's not even political.
[03:00:30.023 --> 03:00:31.704]  It's not even philosophical.
[03:00:31.884 --> 03:00:33.485]  It's truly demonic.
[03:00:34.406 --> 03:00:50.497]  Because they were crossbreeding, as I was saying before, crossbreeding animals and humans as far back as the 20s, and probably earlier than that, the 1800s, that they were talking about such kind of technology that was coming.
[03:00:51.241 --> 03:01:08.835]  And when you start looking at how these people are redesigning the human creature so that we will be able to at least have the intelligence to do a particular job that is given to us, but our brains will be blank.
[03:01:09.796 --> 03:01:12.859]  We can see that now everywhere in schools.
[03:01:13.900 --> 03:01:16.301]  Young people, you talk to them and they're blank.
[03:01:16.522 --> 03:01:18.003]  They just stare past you.
[03:01:18.652 --> 03:01:22.893]  They have no idea that their humanity has been taken away from them.
[03:01:24.214 --> 03:01:46.521]  Their ability to think... I was in San Diego working for the Truth Seeker Company a few years back, and one night when the Hale-Bob Comet came over, I walked out in the evening, and the comet was out, and there was a bunch of high school kids out in the parking lot next to my car.
[03:01:47.048 --> 03:01:50.010]  And I walked up, and they were all standing there looking at the comet.
[03:01:50.510 --> 03:01:53.912]  And so I was talking with them, and they said, well, what is that?
[03:01:54.152 --> 03:01:55.252]  And I said, it's a comet.
[03:01:55.913 --> 03:02:03.617]  And they said to me, and they were very nice kids, and they were very real, they weren't smart aleck, and they asked, what is a comet?
[03:02:04.397 --> 03:02:06.118]  And I was shocked that they didn't know.
[03:02:06.178 --> 03:02:10.121]  So I talked with them a little bit about comets and astronomy, etc.
[03:02:10.661 --> 03:02:12.602]  And one of the boys said to me, he says,
[03:02:13.676 --> 03:02:19.299]  Can you answer something that we've all wondered and nobody knows, where does the sun go when it leaves?
[03:02:20.200 --> 03:02:24.102]  We see it come up and we see it go down, but where does it go when it leaves here?
[03:02:24.322 --> 03:02:28.724]  And the next phase will be a cop laughing at you saying there isn't a comet.
[03:02:29.025 --> 03:02:29.565]  Exactly.
[03:02:29.625 --> 03:02:33.187]  I mean now they think, have you seen the idiocracy that Mike Judge made?
[03:02:35.228 --> 03:02:38.929]  Yes, but God knows there's all kinds of movies out there.
[03:02:38.969 --> 03:02:44.350]  But I mean, in that movie, if you know how to talk, they arrest you as a heretic.
[03:02:44.510 --> 03:02:45.230]  Yeah, I know.
[03:02:45.470 --> 03:02:45.930]  I know that.
[03:02:46.030 --> 03:02:48.011]  And it's almost like that now.
[03:02:48.591 --> 03:02:51.171]  I mean, you say to a cop, you can't stop me at a random checkpoint.
[03:02:51.211 --> 03:02:53.752]  Fourth Amendment, he'll just laugh and go, you're one of them nuts!
[03:02:54.472 --> 03:02:57.873]  I have the state police on video and road to tyranny out of their own squad car.
[03:02:58.293 --> 03:03:00.953]  First we show FEMA training, and then we even have video out of the squad car.
[03:03:01.273 --> 03:03:03.274]  And they arrest the woman for a pocket Constitution.
[03:03:03.914 --> 03:03:06.877]  And the state police are going, I believe this Constitution is illegal.
[03:03:07.157 --> 03:03:10.560]  And he's going, he starts breathing heavy going, I can't believe she's got one.
[03:03:11.540 --> 03:03:12.441]  I can't believe it.
[03:03:12.822 --> 03:03:14.203]  I can't believe it.
[03:03:14.503 --> 03:03:16.725]  And then another cop comes over and goes, no, wait a minute.
[03:03:17.305 --> 03:03:18.406]  Like he's the genius one.
[03:03:18.907 --> 03:03:21.509]  I think she might be allowed to have that.
[03:03:23.479 --> 03:03:24.760]  No, this is word for word!
[03:03:25.260 --> 03:03:30.563]  I mean, I don't take any sardonic pleasure that I'm like a god compared to these people.
[03:03:30.683 --> 03:03:31.483]  It freaks me out!
[03:03:31.543 --> 03:03:32.264]  I'm nobody!
[03:03:32.504 --> 03:03:34.465]  And I'm like a god compared to most!
[03:03:34.665 --> 03:03:35.906]  And the elite just love it!
[03:03:36.266 --> 03:03:37.547]  I'm totally freaked out!
[03:03:37.927 --> 03:03:41.329]  I know, that's what that one comedian said in Hollywood.
[03:03:41.349 --> 03:03:43.570]  He said, I feel like a god among insects.
[03:03:44.430 --> 03:03:45.111]  Because I think.
[03:03:46.271 --> 03:03:47.052]  Yeah, he just died.
[03:03:47.092 --> 03:03:48.673]  That was Carlin.
[03:03:48.933 --> 03:03:50.193]  Yeah, that's what it was.
[03:03:50.734 --> 03:03:52.795]  Here's a great quotation from a book.
[03:03:53.439 --> 03:03:54.300]  It's on my website.
[03:03:54.320 --> 03:03:55.440]  It's been there for years.
[03:03:55.540 --> 03:04:00.043]  It's from the book called The New Totalitarians by Roland Humpert.
[03:04:00.663 --> 03:04:13.771]  And in the book, he says this, that Aldous Huxley, and Julian Huxley was his father, Huxley... You're right, I keep calling him a brother, yeah.
[03:04:13.871 --> 03:04:15.893]  Yes, that's what it was, brother.
[03:04:16.053 --> 03:04:23.097]  And so Julian Huxley said something very interesting, and it was quoted in The New Totalitarian book.
[03:04:23.891 --> 03:04:32.933]  The quote is this, as political and economic freedom diminishes, sexual freedom tends compensatingly to increase.
[03:04:33.653 --> 03:04:44.115]  And the dictator, unless he needs cannon fodder or families with which to colonize empty or conquered territories, will do well to encourage that freedom.
[03:04:44.695 --> 03:04:49.416]  In conjunction with the freedom to daydream under the influence of narcotics,
[03:04:50.598 --> 03:04:57.884]  The movies, the radio, and it will help to reconcile his subjects to the servitude which is now their fate.
[03:04:58.125 --> 03:05:10.676]  Have you seen the Bertrand Russell quote where he says, a revolt by the slaves by the time we're done with it, I'm paraphrasing, will be as ridiculous as a revolt of sheep, you know, who are being cut up for mutton.
[03:05:11.296 --> 03:05:11.777]  Yep, yep.
[03:05:12.117 --> 03:05:15.100]  And here's another quote, important.
[03:05:15.740 --> 03:05:17.622]  So Alex Frazier-Taylor said,
[03:05:18.788 --> 03:05:29.231]  He was born in 1742, died in 1813, said this, quote, The average age of the world's great civilizations has been around 200 years.
[03:05:29.991 --> 03:05:47.195]  These nations have progressed through this sequence from bondage to spiritual faith, from spiritual faith to great courage, from great courage to liberty, and from liberty to abundance, from abundance to selfishness, from selfishness to complacency,
[03:05:47.813 --> 03:05:55.878]  From complacency to apathy, and from apathy back to dependence, and from dependence back to bondage.
[03:05:56.138 --> 03:05:59.960]  Yeah, let me read you Bertrand Russell, who they claim is a great liberal who said, exterminate the blacks.
[03:06:00.500 --> 03:06:07.665]  Gradually, by selective breeding, the congenital differences between rulers and ruled will increase until they become almost different species.
[03:06:08.245 --> 03:06:16.370]  A revolt of the plebes would become as unthinkable as an organized insurrection of sheep against the practice of eating mutton.
[03:06:17.902 --> 03:06:19.546]  Now that's exactly what you've been talking about.
[03:06:19.586 --> 03:06:20.006]  Here's another one.
[03:06:20.307 --> 03:06:26.279]  Although the science will be diligently studied, it will be rigidly confined to the governing class.
[03:06:26.700 --> 03:06:28.824]  The populace will be allowed to know how it can...
[03:06:29.887 --> 03:06:31.268]  Uh, convictions were generated.
[03:06:32.089 --> 03:06:42.677]  Uh, when the technique has been perfected, every government that has been in charge of education for a generation will be able to control its subjects securely without the need of armies or policemen.
[03:06:42.937 --> 03:06:45.319]  That was out of his book, The Impact of Science and Society, 53.
[03:06:46.540 --> 03:06:48.301]  Now, now, let me just say this.
[03:06:48.542 --> 03:06:52.985]  I told the story yesterday on the air again and I told it a few months ago because it was shocking to me.
[03:06:53.025 --> 03:06:53.706]  About a year ago,
[03:06:55.046 --> 03:07:06.312]  Endgame was getting ready to be finished in a few months and my parents came by to pick me up at my office because I was working on a Saturday afternoon and my daughter had a ballet recital and they picked her up.
[03:07:07.192 --> 03:07:08.313]  So we're going to the ballet recital.
[03:07:08.333 --> 03:07:12.755]  I don't know why I tell that part of the story, but the point is, I guess because I don't want to sound like a little kid, but my parents picking me up.
[03:07:12.775 --> 03:07:22.640]  The point is, they pull into the office, my mother comes in, she's real smart, you know, has a degree in history, she's sitting there watching the film where I'm talking about how they plan to exterminate us and we're showing the quotes
[03:07:23.420 --> 03:07:28.287]  And she goes, but I know some of them say that, and I've read it, but they really plan that?
[03:07:28.307 --> 03:07:30.950]  And we're driving in the car, and my dad goes, let me just tell you a story.
[03:07:31.711 --> 03:07:38.320]  He was in the Texas Academy, a young scientist, and when he was a junior in high school, he was already at UT.
[03:07:38.880 --> 03:07:39.100]  We're good.
[03:07:56.917 --> 03:07:58.839]  Yeah, I know, but I've heard the same thing from
[03:08:24.441 --> 03:08:36.587]  FBI men that I've known, and CIA people I know, and all kinds of interesting people around the world that I've been fortunate enough to meet and to be in their private company.
[03:08:37.027 --> 03:08:43.310]  I've sat in Egypt and listened to scholars there talking about what they know about what's going on in the Middle East.
[03:08:44.531 --> 03:08:49.533]  And this kind of information has been out there from day one, but most people are not
[03:08:50.077 --> 03:08:50.878]  Well, here's my point.
[03:08:50.938 --> 03:08:57.025]  They, for two years, off and on, coming into the university a couple times a month, found the 125 smartest kids in not just normal tests, but all sorts of things.
[03:09:10.640 --> 03:09:16.183]  My dad later found out that it was a program for astronaut screening and other government programs.
[03:09:16.203 --> 03:09:17.003]  They had this everywhere.
[03:09:17.603 --> 03:09:23.826]  But then what they really selected them out for at the end was, okay, you're the sixth best after a two-year program.
[03:09:23.846 --> 03:09:30.630]  They would give them the supplies, and my dad would go home and build a laser, and stuff like that, and see if they could do it.
[03:09:31.130 --> 03:09:38.954]  And at the end of it, it's okay, you've been chosen, you're going to be a minion of the ruling elite, and you're going to help carry out the extermination.
[03:09:39.754 --> 03:09:44.218]  I mean, that's my... Folks, it didn't just happen to my dad's my whole point.
[03:09:44.478 --> 03:09:44.839]  Yeah.
[03:09:45.079 --> 03:09:53.786]  And then I guess his name was on some list, because then later they tried to recruit him and other top dentists for some secret, you know, cybernetic bone implant thing for soldiers in the 80s.
[03:09:54.927 --> 03:10:18.408]  I got a buddy who they recruited, who's only a few years older than me, he's a Hollywood producer, and he got recruited and then Microsoft came to him and said, we're hiring you because we have your file on that advanced thing you did in Houston, which is really a NASA program for advanced children, and we've got your file and we want to just pay you a couple million a year just to find out the contents of your brain.
[03:10:19.649 --> 03:10:21.330]  I mean, that's what they're doing, folks!
[03:10:21.590 --> 03:10:22.731]  Well, I know, I know.
[03:10:23.172 --> 03:10:25.954]  Look, we talked about how I got started.
[03:10:27.135 --> 03:10:32.519]  There's another thing I wanted to talk about, how I got started in this.
[03:10:32.539 --> 03:10:39.846]  1967, I was researching the subject of communism in Glendale, California, at the library.
[03:10:40.586 --> 03:10:45.871]  And I had been talking about, as I said, about all this subject of the conspiracies in government, etc.
[03:10:46.670 --> 03:10:53.815]  Since the early 60s, but in 67, I happened to be in Glendale, California, going through the encyclopedias.
[03:10:53.855 --> 03:11:12.767]  I was looking up some information on Soviet communism, and in the World Book Encyclopedia under Soviet Russia, I turned to that page, and there was a picture of the Soviet flag
[03:11:13.410 --> 03:11:20.595]  The red flag with the hammer and sickle, and then beneath it was the Soviet coat of arms.
[03:11:21.315 --> 03:11:26.718]  And beneath each one of those pictures gave a little sentence or two explaining the symbolism.
[03:11:27.519 --> 03:11:41.828]  And when I read the symbolism on the Soviet national coat of arms, it was a shock to me, because since early 60s, I had been researching secret societies and had continually come across
[03:11:42.592 --> 03:11:47.354]  A particular catchphrase that virtually everybody was using.
[03:11:47.414 --> 03:11:48.555]  The British were using it.
[03:11:48.575 --> 03:11:49.855]  The Americans used it.
[03:11:50.355 --> 03:11:51.796]  The communists were using it.
[03:11:51.996 --> 03:11:54.077]  The Nazis used it all the time.
[03:11:54.617 --> 03:11:55.738]  The fascists used it.
[03:11:55.858 --> 03:11:56.378]  Italy.
[03:11:56.498 --> 03:11:58.079]  The ancient Romans used it.
[03:11:58.139 --> 03:11:59.660]  The ancient Greeks used it.
[03:12:00.220 --> 03:12:03.621]  It was a catchphrase that everybody was using.
[03:12:06.082 --> 03:12:08.223]  And I kind of had it in the back of my mind.
[03:12:08.583 --> 03:12:09.644]  Well, there it is again.
[03:12:09.724 --> 03:12:10.824]  And here it is over here.
[03:12:10.864 --> 03:12:11.885]  And there it is over there.
[03:12:12.799 --> 03:12:31.543]  Until such time as I was looking at an encyclopedia under Soviet and read the little piece under the Soviet National Coat of Arms and it absolutely... I was absolutely floored because for the first time I finally got it.
[03:12:32.343 --> 03:12:39.885]  I finally got what that symbol really meant and it changed my life in one day because I knew
[03:12:41.087 --> 03:12:41.887]  Instinctively.
[03:12:41.927 --> 03:12:43.888]  It was all the same team against us.
[03:12:44.309 --> 03:12:46.069]  Well, let me finish.
[03:12:46.330 --> 03:12:52.212]  I instinctively knew that I had found something of awesome importance.
[03:12:52.412 --> 03:12:52.753]  Tell us.
[03:12:53.353 --> 03:12:56.354]  But I didn't understand what it was I found.
[03:12:56.594 --> 03:13:02.597]  I just knew that whatever it is I've got here is going to be explosive one day.
[03:13:02.617 --> 03:13:04.058]  I don't know what it is.
[03:13:04.744 --> 03:13:06.464]  But it's really important.
[03:13:06.524 --> 03:13:07.345]  What's the catchphrase?
[03:13:07.505 --> 03:13:10.445]  And the catchphrase was the dawn of a new day.
[03:13:10.786 --> 03:13:11.086]  Yes.
[03:13:11.286 --> 03:13:15.307]  And the symbol of the sun coming up over the earth in a mountain.
[03:13:15.447 --> 03:13:16.887]  And that's what California's got.
[03:13:16.907 --> 03:13:18.027]  Everybody.
[03:13:18.448 --> 03:13:19.088]  Everybody.
[03:13:19.308 --> 03:13:20.428]  Everybody uses it.
[03:13:20.628 --> 03:13:24.049]  It's used by the Russians, the Nazis,
[03:13:24.674 --> 03:13:34.882]  And once you see how it was used by the ancient Roman Empire, for the Caesars used it, and the ancient Greeks used it... In fact, their top standards wasn't even eagles, it was that rising sun.
[03:13:34.922 --> 03:13:35.762]  That's exactly right.
[03:13:35.782 --> 03:13:37.924]  The Japanese... Absolutely.
[03:13:37.944 --> 03:13:41.867]  So what does it mean from all of your... We know it's sun worship, but what is that new one, rising?
[03:13:41.887 --> 03:13:53.716]  That means that there is a rising on the earth of a very powerful, intellectual, secret order of light and intelligence
[03:13:54.318 --> 03:13:56.539]  That is superior to the human race.
[03:13:56.639 --> 03:13:58.159]  It's superior to humans.
[03:13:58.899 --> 03:14:07.201]  It is a rising of a light in the world which is a other world.
[03:14:07.881 --> 03:14:09.441]  The word I'm looking for is occult.
[03:14:09.922 --> 03:14:13.822]  There is a powerful secret society operating in the world.
[03:14:13.842 --> 03:14:15.943]  And Albert Sykes said that that was Lucifer.
[03:14:16.874 --> 03:14:24.161]  Well, Lucifer is simply the planet Venus, which is the bringer of the light.
[03:14:24.761 --> 03:14:28.285]  Why do they call Jesus the Morning Star in the Bible and Lucifer the Morning Star?
[03:14:28.305 --> 03:14:28.765]  That's right.
[03:14:29.046 --> 03:14:37.033]  Jesus is referred to as Lucifer in the Bible, and that's part of what I'm talking about.
[03:14:37.153 --> 03:14:42.178]  That's part of what I'm trying to explain in a very few words.
[03:14:42.625 --> 03:14:47.547]  There was a war between the two kinds of light, white light and black light.
[03:14:48.127 --> 03:14:56.890]  Black light is used in dance halls and entertainment venues where they use black light.
[03:14:57.390 --> 03:15:02.532]  Black light only shows up certain things, and a white light is different.
[03:15:02.592 --> 03:15:09.575]  So there's a war between two kinds of light, which means there's a war between two kinds of intelligence.
[03:15:10.347 --> 03:15:38.894]  And so that symbol which I'd stumbled on, which was the symbol of the Soviet Union, opened up for me a can of worms that I instilled to this very day over 40 years ago and 67, and today I am still working on it, and one day I would like to be able to have the finances to put together a three or a four hour documentary on the most incredible, dark secret of the human race.
[03:15:39.014 --> 03:15:39.254]  How
[03:15:39.955 --> 03:15:49.758]  This symbol has been used by the most ancient secret societies in preparation and preparing to transform the human race.
[03:15:50.698 --> 03:15:58.321]  And it's just so much to explain, I can't even, you know, it's hard to find words to explain
[03:15:59.048 --> 03:16:03.734]  The significance of what it is that I found.
[03:16:03.874 --> 03:16:13.867]  You're saying an off-world intelligence through human managers that they've made deals with is in the process of basically destroying humanity?
[03:16:13.947 --> 03:16:14.868]  That's exactly right.
[03:16:15.909 --> 03:16:25.414]  And they've been promised immortality and power and godhood if they will treacherously enslave their own species and that's why generationally it continues.
[03:16:25.454 --> 03:16:28.516]  That's why it's more advanced than our greatest intellectuals.
[03:16:28.836 --> 03:16:40.342]  That's why it's so incredibly subtle that even our greatest minds have trouble like John the Revelator on Patmos reveling at the beast couldn't even believe what he was seeing.
[03:16:40.723 --> 03:16:44.745]  It's so huge that our greatest minds can't even hardly grasp it.
[03:16:45.889 --> 03:16:47.510]  That's exactly right!
[03:16:48.130 --> 03:16:54.514]  And let me give you one quick quote from a reference book on secret societies.
[03:16:54.574 --> 03:16:59.397]  I want to just give you this quote, because it's very germane to what I'm talking about.
[03:17:00.397 --> 03:17:10.303]  This is a quote from a lady who was a member of the Golden Dawn Society, and she was very old when she left the Golden Dawn, and she was interviewed in France.
[03:17:11.218 --> 03:17:39.806]  And she said this, she said, I have been convinced that we, as an order, and at that point, the Golden Dawn, I have been convinced that we, as an order, have come under the power of some very evil occult order, profoundly versed in science, both occult and otherwise, though not infallible, their methods being black magic, that is to say, electromagnetic power, hypnotism, and powerful suggestion.
[03:17:40.470 --> 03:17:52.397]  We are convinced that the Order is being controlled by some kind of a Sun Order, after the nature of the Illuminati, if not by that Order itself."
[03:17:54.158 --> 03:18:01.662]  I'm telling you, when I was reading this, I thought, my God, this is something awesome that I have stumbled upon.
[03:18:01.682 --> 03:18:04.504]  I just can't get to the end of it.
[03:18:04.544 --> 03:18:08.967]  I've just got hundreds... Are the true initiates of the true Order less than 100?
[03:18:10.026 --> 03:18:10.787]  I would think so.
[03:18:10.967 --> 03:18:20.512]  Very, very, very small select few who can really wrap their brains around what this whole thing is all about.
[03:18:20.673 --> 03:18:31.959]  It's the transmutation of the human race, preparing the human family on the Earth for a new age, a new dawn of a whole new kind of Earth.
[03:18:32.159 --> 03:18:32.520]  Hellish!
[03:18:33.040 --> 03:18:35.902]  And I'm telling you, I've been looking at this for over 40 years.
[03:18:35.922 --> 03:18:37.983]  I would love to be able to do something with it.
[03:18:38.652 --> 03:18:42.517]  But the problem I have faced, Alex, is that I don't have anything.
[03:18:42.597 --> 03:18:53.730]  I just live in two rooms with my sick brother who have nothing because I've spent my whole life... Well, Jordan, this is important enough that I can probably work with you or try to get some folks to help you.
[03:18:53.991 --> 03:18:56.694]  I would love to work with you on this and really
[03:18:57.833 --> 03:19:00.695]  Do something with this subject that nobody's ever heard of.
[03:19:00.715 --> 03:19:10.822]  Well, I understand that you want to do a masterwork with it, but I think something like the basic slide projection, but lay it all out, because time is of the essence, and just get something.
[03:19:11.143 --> 03:19:11.863]  I mean, make it good.
[03:19:11.903 --> 03:19:19.188]  Put video over what you're saying as well, but like a slide projection with video, you know, put over it, and you go into a few sites.
[03:19:19.629 --> 03:19:23.612]  And because of your illness, we need to do this, because time is of the essence, and I'm really glad that...
[03:19:24.312 --> 03:19:27.473]  Listen, I know, and I've got to take my children to a dental appointment.
[03:19:27.733 --> 03:19:30.553]  We have like 15 phone calls posted here.
[03:19:30.593 --> 03:19:37.875]  We've got Jennifer, and Ryan, and Matt, and Ben, and Graham, and Greg, and Scott, and Joe, and Dave, and Elroy, and Matt, and David.
[03:19:38.275 --> 03:19:43.836]  I'm going to try to give each caller 30-45 seconds a quick answer from Jordan that I'm going to run out of here.
[03:19:44.076 --> 03:19:46.156]  We'll probably end up keeping you another 15 minutes.
[03:19:47.037 --> 03:19:47.437]  Okay, great.
[03:19:47.477 --> 03:19:48.637]  Let's move quickly now.
[03:19:49.617 --> 03:19:50.418]  Folks, I just want to tell you this.
[03:19:50.598 --> 03:19:55.682]  I have been, with all my knowledge, the conscious mind can't really fully analyze it all.
[03:19:55.842 --> 03:20:12.556]  I have been truly sitting in like a chair for two hours straight, trying to get to the basics of what it all is, and I have to tell you, and I'm not getting, I don't cover UFOs, I don't cover all that because there's so much disinfo and so much weirdness, but studying the elite, how they behave, how they even look upset, it's like they know they're under orders.
[03:20:14.358 --> 03:20:22.745]  I keep coming back with, it is an outside intelligence, call it spiritual, whatever you want, inter-dimensional, that is controlling these people.
[03:20:22.905 --> 03:20:24.446]  What they're doing is so horrible.
[03:20:25.287 --> 03:20:31.912]  And I mean, what politician would come out and say, we rape children and rip their genitals off of pliers and put it in White House documents?
[03:20:32.332 --> 03:20:34.294]  They're doing something to us.
[03:20:34.954 --> 03:20:36.956]  They're getting us ready for greater horrors.
[03:20:37.256 --> 03:20:39.318]  It's some type of, I mean,
[03:20:40.238 --> 03:20:49.822]  God knows what it is, folks, but I can just tell you, just in my spirit, I intellectually track all this, and then in my spirit I try to go, okay, what is it behind that final door?
[03:20:50.302 --> 03:20:52.863]  And it is hell itself being released on the earth.
[03:20:53.083 --> 03:21:04.508]  I'm telling you, and I've been looking at this, like I said, for so many years, but it was back in 1967 that I made a profound discovery, and I've been working on it for over 40 years,
[03:21:05.572 --> 03:21:05.892]  I don't
[03:21:21.298 --> 03:21:22.359]  I'm doing good, Alex.
[03:21:22.399 --> 03:21:22.839]  How are you?
[03:21:22.859 --> 03:21:23.099]  Good.
[03:21:23.119 --> 03:21:24.540]  And good to talk to you again, Jordan.
[03:21:24.580 --> 03:21:27.741]  Hey, listen guys, I'll tell you what, this whole interview was just fireworks for me.
[03:21:27.801 --> 03:21:28.621]  Absolutely riveting and amazing.
[03:21:51.064 --> 03:21:56.268]  I did want to let y'all know I'm doing a documentary with Jordan on his last work, and that will be coming out soon.
[03:21:56.529 --> 03:22:07.718]  My quick question is, it's all this talk about this coming new agenda, and it's part of the new man theory, and my question is this.
[03:22:08.228 --> 03:22:14.410]  You know, even in 1927 film Metropolis, the machine man, is technology going to change?
[03:22:14.790 --> 03:22:20.791]  Is it possible that technology... Yeah, they're talking about us interfacing with it, and that's why they say, what's going to happen in 2001?
[03:22:21.172 --> 03:22:22.232]  Something wonderful.
[03:22:22.592 --> 03:22:22.852]  Yeah.
[03:22:22.892 --> 03:22:23.892]  But it's not wonderful.
[03:22:24.052 --> 03:22:24.833]  It's hellish.
[03:22:25.653 --> 03:22:31.875]  Okay, let me ask, could it be that technology could backfire against them, or are we just going to be slaves to the machine?
[03:22:31.955 --> 03:22:34.595]  Well, I think that has to do with... It's a choice.
[03:22:34.915 --> 03:22:35.776]  ...what we're talking about.
[03:22:35.916 --> 03:22:36.856]  God, I think that
[03:22:37.746 --> 03:22:40.588]  What we're up against is something unworldly.
[03:22:40.648 --> 03:22:41.989]  It's not of our world.
[03:22:42.570 --> 03:22:45.152]  And Christians should understand and relate to that.
[03:22:45.232 --> 03:22:48.895]  Jews, especially Orthodox, should understand.
[03:22:48.935 --> 03:22:51.737]  We're talking about something that's out there.
[03:22:52.417 --> 03:22:56.320]  Ask any six-year-old where God is, and they'll point straight up into the heavens.
[03:22:56.760 --> 03:22:57.781]  Well, God's out there.
[03:22:57.841 --> 03:23:01.504]  Well, whatever is out there is far superior to us
[03:23:02.279 --> 03:23:06.081]  And the Angels, Sons of God, my God, that's a subject that I could talk about.
[03:23:06.101 --> 03:23:12.024]  Yeah, we know there's a lot, the problem is there's, you can feel it in your gut, every culture says it, there's two forces out there.
[03:23:12.084 --> 03:23:12.545]  You got it.
[03:23:12.685 --> 03:23:16.087]  That's the, and the dark force is definitely on this globe.
[03:23:17.047 --> 03:23:24.011]  Yeah, well what do you think Star Wars and, you know, Indiana Jones and Star Wars especially is talking about?
[03:23:24.991 --> 03:23:27.493]  George Lucas, I mean I had lunch with George Lucas.
[03:23:28.634 --> 03:23:30.075]  I know what these symbols mean.
[03:23:30.315 --> 03:23:32.636]  I know what Hollywood is doing, what they're telling you.
[03:23:32.856 --> 03:23:37.959]  And George Lucas is a brilliant guy, and he's trying to explain to the world.
[03:23:38.539 --> 03:23:46.563]  Oh, his new film has the Emperor staging terror attacks to get a police state, and then you find out in the end he's behind Bin Laden.
[03:23:48.544 --> 03:23:53.786]  I know, but it's just a story that is so awesome in scope.
[03:23:54.086 --> 03:23:55.647]  Hey Matt, when's this video going to be up?
[03:23:56.497 --> 03:23:58.359]  We're still in production.
[03:23:58.379 --> 03:24:01.781]  We're going to take our time and do it right, Alex, so I'll definitely keep you posted.
[03:24:01.801 --> 03:24:03.502]  I'm going to drop so other callers can get in.
[03:24:03.802 --> 03:24:05.103]  Thanks again, Alex, for having me.
[03:24:05.123 --> 03:24:07.365]  Well, Matt, fire out your website.
[03:24:07.825 --> 03:24:11.988]  It's truthmovement.com, and we're getting ready to launch 33rdparallel.tv again.
[03:24:14.270 --> 03:24:15.271]  That's interesting, Jordan.
[03:24:15.551 --> 03:24:17.072]  Tell us about the George Lucas launch.
[03:24:17.993 --> 03:24:22.636]  Well, I was invited by Disney to a special party.
[03:24:23.543 --> 03:24:31.366]  Out at Disneyland, where I met Michael Eisner and Lucas and Danny DeVito and God knows all kinds of movie stars.
[03:24:31.386 --> 03:24:34.887]  Because they're into this and they want to meet with somebody on the outside who knows what they know.
[03:24:35.147 --> 03:24:38.428]  Well, I was invited and I had a nice conversation.
[03:24:38.508 --> 03:24:49.292]  George Lucas actually said to me, we were all standing and eating, it was kind of like a big circus kind of atmosphere, and he said,
[03:24:51.553 --> 03:24:52.734]  I introduced myself.
[03:24:52.794 --> 03:24:55.536]  He asked me my name, and I told him, and he said, Jordan Maxwell.
[03:24:55.996 --> 03:24:57.637]  He said, you know what?
[03:24:58.178 --> 03:24:59.038]  I know that name.
[03:24:59.098 --> 03:25:02.581]  He said, you're in a book, a red cover book, isn't it?
[03:25:02.721 --> 03:25:04.622]  Something about the Church doesn't want you to know?
[03:25:04.642 --> 03:25:05.783]  And I said, yes.
[03:25:05.883 --> 03:25:09.325]  And I said, it's an honor that you would know about me.
[03:25:09.345 --> 03:25:14.809]  He said, well, the only reason I know about you, Jordan, is because my wife is a voracious reader.
[03:25:14.849 --> 03:25:15.809]  She reads everything.
[03:25:15.829 --> 03:25:16.650]  I don't read.
[03:25:16.670 --> 03:25:17.991]  I hire people.
[03:25:18.516 --> 03:25:22.039]  To do the research for the movies, etc.
[03:25:22.480 --> 03:25:25.042]  And he said, but she made me read your part.
[03:25:25.102 --> 03:25:26.583]  That's why I remember your name.
[03:25:27.284 --> 03:25:30.146]  So he said, give me your business card.
[03:25:30.206 --> 03:25:34.790]  And then Michael Eisner, president of Disney, said, well, what are you talking about?
[03:25:34.890 --> 03:25:40.255]  And then we got in a conversation about Hollywood, magic, the occult world, etc.
[03:25:41.216 --> 03:25:41.836]  What did he say?
[03:25:43.101 --> 03:25:47.322]  I'm not going to talk about that any further on the air, but we'll talk about that in private.
[03:25:47.402 --> 03:25:58.024]  But it was interesting, because I asked them, I said, you know, the very concept of the Hollywood comes from the old Druidic priest in the ancient... Who made it out of the Hollywood?
[03:25:58.104 --> 03:26:06.826]  Yeah, because their magic wands, the magical priests used magic wands and they were always made out of the wood of a holly tree, made out of Hollywood.
[03:26:08.488 --> 03:26:13.492]  And so we had a very long-term, interesting conversation going there for a bit.
[03:26:13.832 --> 03:26:14.293]  Oh, I bet.
[03:26:14.853 --> 03:26:18.536]  Let's go ahead and Hollywood knows all about all of it, folks.
[03:26:18.716 --> 03:26:19.276]  You can bet it.
[03:26:19.356 --> 03:26:20.137]  You better believe it.
[03:26:20.157 --> 03:26:22.519]  I've been out there, probably not as much as Jordan as he lives out there.
[03:26:23.259 --> 03:26:25.781]  Let's talk to Ryan in California.
[03:26:25.801 --> 03:26:26.602]  You're on the air, Ryan.
[03:26:26.622 --> 03:26:29.744]  Hi, thanks so much for taking my call, Alex.
[03:26:30.265 --> 03:26:34.448]  It's wonderful to be able to talk to you, Jordan, and that's absolutely wonderful information you've been getting out.
[03:26:35.314 --> 03:26:36.555]  Real quickly, I had two things.
[03:26:36.976 --> 03:26:45.622]  First of all, I just wanted to let anyone who has cancer know about an amazing man named Rick Simpson who's got a website out there up in Canada.
[03:26:46.263 --> 03:26:49.946]  I would urge Jordan and everyone else who has health problems to go there.
[03:26:49.986 --> 03:26:53.208]  It's called phoenixtearsmovie.com.
[03:26:53.989 --> 03:26:55.050]  Email me.
[03:26:55.170 --> 03:27:01.374]  Go on my website to jordanmaxwell.com and at the buttons at the top, it says contact.
[03:27:01.415 --> 03:27:03.116]  Go to contact and scroll down.
[03:27:03.615 --> 03:27:09.580]  First two are not mine, but the third one, scroll down and email me that information so I'll have it right in front of me.
[03:27:09.680 --> 03:27:10.921]  Okay, we've got to move quick, sir.
[03:27:11.422 --> 03:27:24.613]  The only second thing I had real quick was, as far as the rising sun, I've seen a lot of drawings, especially in Roman Catholic Church, paintings and such, of mushrooms and such like that, and I heard you talk about that in your film, Basic Sled Show.
[03:27:24.673 --> 03:27:26.414]  I'm wondering if you could give me any more information.
[03:27:26.434 --> 03:27:27.735]  Well, that's what I want to do.
[03:27:27.815 --> 03:27:29.937]  Maybe Alex and I will do something together on this.
[03:27:29.957 --> 03:27:30.217]  Wonderful.
[03:27:31.417 --> 03:27:33.498]  That's something out there that's going to blow people away.
[03:27:33.918 --> 03:27:39.000]  Yeah, because I've read Apples of Apollo and I've studied your work and it's fascinating and just, you know, keep up the good work.
[03:27:39.020 --> 03:27:40.120]  There's a big story there yet.
[03:27:40.441 --> 03:27:41.421]  A big story to come.
[03:27:42.001 --> 03:27:43.342]  Okay, thank you, Ryan.
[03:27:43.502 --> 03:27:43.862]  Thank you.
[03:27:43.882 --> 03:27:45.022]  Sorry we're having to hurry here.
[03:27:45.542 --> 03:27:47.463]  Jennifer in California, you're on the air.
[03:27:48.284 --> 03:27:49.704]  Hi, thanks for taking my call.
[03:27:49.724 --> 03:27:50.744]  Sorry about my phone.
[03:27:51.705 --> 03:27:56.947]  I just wanted to thank you guys for everything that you've done for all of us out here and I wanted to
[03:27:57.500 --> 03:28:01.148]  Let's talk about the interesting Obama poster with his rising.
[03:28:02.293 --> 03:28:02.513]  Quite.
[03:28:02.613 --> 03:28:04.553]  And that never gets pointed out.
[03:28:04.594 --> 03:28:05.574]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:28:05.614 --> 03:28:07.214]  You noticed that, didn't you?
[03:28:07.314 --> 03:28:08.834]  Oh, I can't not notice it.
[03:28:08.854 --> 03:28:10.275]  It's the first thing that pops out at me.
[03:28:10.295 --> 03:28:11.175]  That's right.
[03:28:11.255 --> 03:28:18.616]  Look, he's got the eugenicist Warren Buffett, who's given $47 billion of his money to carry out eugenics ops on black people.
[03:28:18.977 --> 03:28:21.557]  But hey, he's for a black guy, so everything's okay.
[03:28:21.777 --> 03:28:22.257]  That's right.
[03:28:22.337 --> 03:28:24.018]  It's amazing to me.
[03:28:24.038 --> 03:28:27.858]  The race lines are still so prevalent and it's such nonsense.
[03:28:28.078 --> 03:28:30.599]  But that symbol is very, very important.
[03:28:31.372 --> 03:28:41.778]  And, uh, and it's telling you something, and all the presidents have used it, but especially, uh, what's the other guy, uh, McCain, a Republican, what's his name?
[03:28:41.918 --> 03:28:42.519]  McCain.
[03:28:42.879 --> 03:28:47.942]  McCain came out and said, uh, McCain blew me away.
[03:28:48.102 --> 03:28:59.829]  I was almost, I almost had to fall backwards when I heard McCain in one of his lectures using Illuminati terms, which are in-house terms that nobody knows.
[03:29:00.387 --> 03:29:03.190]  Unless you're inside to know what those words meant.
[03:29:03.630 --> 03:29:06.794]  And he used those terms and words in his speeches.
[03:29:06.814 --> 03:29:07.775]  Well, what about when Bush Sr.
[03:29:07.835 --> 03:29:12.259]  is talking about thousand points of life and a new dawn?
[03:29:12.600 --> 03:29:14.702]  I mean, that is total occultic.
[03:29:14.822 --> 03:29:21.268]  And people say we're such conspiracy theorists to believe the stuff that's coming right out of their mouths, you know?
[03:29:21.288 --> 03:29:23.571]  And when we show it to them, they just
[03:29:24.341 --> 03:29:27.783]  Well, there are none so blind as those who choose not to see.
[03:29:27.803 --> 03:29:28.284]  Right.
[03:29:33.300 --> 03:29:41.765]  And I'd like to say to everybody who has children, you know, it's our responsibility as parents to prepare our kids for this and to teach them that this is going on.
[03:29:41.805 --> 03:29:48.449]  And if we give them the education and if we show our own kids what's going on, then this information will be passed on.
[03:29:48.489 --> 03:29:49.409]  Well, here's what happened.
[03:29:49.429 --> 03:29:51.010]  We know they've been poisoning the food.
[03:29:51.050 --> 03:29:52.471]  We know they've been poisoning the water.
[03:29:52.551 --> 03:29:54.352]  We know they've been poisoning the vaccines.
[03:29:54.412 --> 03:29:58.715]  Now that people are filtering water, trying to get away from it, now they're putting it in the air.
[03:29:58.735 --> 03:30:00.356]  I mean, they admit it.
[03:30:00.416 --> 03:30:02.137]  I mean, they are coming after us.
[03:30:03.497 --> 03:30:19.544]  I mean, they're saying, the elite says in hundreds of documents, and I appreciate your call, Jennifer, that we have to, they say there's going to be a middle class that will have elite genetics, this is their view, I'm not saying it's true, they will threaten us, they will get in the way of what we're doing, it's like bad sons, we've got to cut them down.
[03:30:20.404 --> 03:30:25.186]  And, you know, I don't want to be cut down, I don't want my kids dying early of cancer, you bastards need to stop.
[03:30:27.190 --> 03:30:27.570]  I agree.
[03:30:27.590 --> 03:30:28.931]  Alright, let's take another call here.
[03:30:28.951 --> 03:30:32.192]  Let's talk to Graham in Seattle, then Ben and others.
[03:30:32.453 --> 03:30:33.073]  Graham, go ahead.
[03:30:33.093 --> 03:30:36.495]  Hi, it's an honor to speak with you.
[03:30:36.775 --> 03:30:38.155]  I've never heard Jordan speak.
[03:30:38.215 --> 03:30:39.736]  Thanks for having him on today.
[03:30:41.477 --> 03:30:55.984]  I was just going to mention real quick, David Eich, that's how you pronounce his name, you know, a lot of the stuff he talks about is right on, but he starts talking about the whole, like, reptilian thing, and then you were talking about
[03:30:56.480 --> 03:31:02.968]  Uh, crossbreeding humans with other types of species, and I was thinking maybe, you know, I know some people who claim to have seen these things.
[03:31:02.988 --> 03:31:05.071]  Well, by the way, John, well listen, here's the problem.
[03:31:05.431 --> 03:31:06.332]  Hold on a minute, hold on.
[03:31:06.773 --> 03:31:07.714]  This is where I get irritated.
[03:31:09.116 --> 03:31:09.436]  Okay.
[03:31:10.197 --> 03:31:14.482]  In 2003, the Washington Post reported what I had seen in government documents.
[03:31:14.502 --> 03:31:15.684]  This is public stuff, sir.
[03:31:16.869 --> 03:31:25.395]  Okay, that they have human chimpanzee crosses, and they've got them in Argentina, they've got them in Costa Rica, and they've got them in South Korea, okay?
[03:31:25.435 --> 03:31:25.635]  Right.
[03:31:25.815 --> 03:31:32.560]  They have, now this is finally all over the BBC, they've got part human, part bovine, part cow.
[03:31:33.060 --> 03:31:36.723]  They grow humanoids up inside cows' uteruses.
[03:31:37.043 --> 03:31:39.324]  They're part cow, so the cow uterus won't reject them.
[03:31:39.584 --> 03:31:41.166]  They harvest the organs out of the babies.
[03:31:42.086 --> 03:31:46.688]  I read that in university public stuff ten years ago and I'd get laughed at.
[03:31:47.029 --> 03:31:51.731]  Like I read the Telecommunications Act that said the NSA was taking over all the phone companies.
[03:31:52.091 --> 03:31:53.272]  And then now it's in the news.
[03:31:53.692 --> 03:32:00.015]  So you're saying you've heard, and I'm not mad at you, I mean you care, you're calling in, you've heard people seeing these things.
[03:32:00.455 --> 03:32:04.617]  Why do we always talk about what some lady told somebody or what somebody heard?
[03:32:05.038 --> 03:32:07.239]  They have been doing this since the twenties.
[03:32:07.579 --> 03:32:08.719]  It's now admitted.
[03:32:09.260 --> 03:32:09.560]  Jordan?
[03:32:10.180 --> 03:32:16.223]  Yeah, I mean, it's there in the magazines and all of their rough reference works published by the U.S.
[03:32:17.104 --> 03:32:21.146]  publishing companies that publish the documents out of Washington.
[03:32:21.566 --> 03:32:23.467]  They're telling you in your face.
[03:32:24.507 --> 03:32:35.073]  But most people don't read anyway, because, and I understand why most people are not interested in this kind of thing, because it really doesn't, in the final analysis, this kind of information
[03:32:35.529 --> 03:32:37.310]  Well, I know, but that's the human race.
[03:32:37.330 --> 03:32:37.870]  No, it's okay.
[03:32:37.890 --> 03:32:40.272]  I wasn't trying to imply that it wasn't the human race.
[03:32:56.286 --> 03:32:59.928]  I wasn't trying to imply at all that it wasn't realistic to cross-breed humans.
[03:33:00.188 --> 03:33:13.995]  No, I know, but we wanted you to, for people listening, laughing at us, we wanted those schmucks to know, we're warning them, listen, I had a guy eight years ago at a Conan's Pizza poke me in the arm and get in my face and call me a liar about spider goats.
[03:33:14.684 --> 03:33:15.184]  Yeah.
[03:33:15.244 --> 03:33:16.485]  It's all over the news.
[03:33:16.545 --> 03:33:17.766]  I had the head of the company on.
[03:33:17.786 --> 03:33:19.967]  They got labs all over Texas and New York.
[03:33:20.268 --> 03:33:21.588]  Part spider, part goat.
[03:33:21.788 --> 03:33:25.271]  And the bastard told me I'm a liar and he told me he had a degree in biology.
[03:33:25.591 --> 03:33:26.652]  He's in denial.
[03:33:26.692 --> 03:33:27.392]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:33:27.672 --> 03:33:28.253]  You're right.
[03:33:28.473 --> 03:33:28.713]  I know.
[03:33:29.662 --> 03:33:47.341]  I just wanted to talk specifically, I mean, kind of when David Ickes started talking about reptilians and stuff, I sort of kind of turned it off because it didn't seem like he was talking about them being from the underworld or something, and it seemed really out there, and I felt like it might have been some disinformation that they were trying to mix in with truth.
[03:33:47.441 --> 03:33:49.582]  But see, I go off what we can prove.
[03:33:49.662 --> 03:33:51.003]  Jordan goes off what you can prove.
[03:33:51.023 --> 03:33:52.004]  I'm not knocking, David.
[03:33:52.384 --> 03:33:53.304]  I'm not here to get into that.
[03:33:53.324 --> 03:33:56.907]  The point is, he'll say some lady turned into a reptoid in front of me.
[03:33:57.147 --> 03:34:00.949]  Well, why not just go to the fact that they admit they're creating reptoid humans?
[03:34:01.489 --> 03:34:01.929]  That's right.
[03:34:02.049 --> 03:34:03.590]  Well, why not just actually... I'll tell you that.
[03:34:04.551 --> 03:34:14.957]  Yeah, I mean... That's a whole subject in itself that I'd like to get into in relation to the Bible, because there's a lot of stuff in the Bible talking about that exact
[03:34:15.918 --> 03:34:17.879]  Genesis sounds like genetic engineering.
[03:34:17.959 --> 03:34:18.959]  It's describing it.
[03:34:20.059 --> 03:34:21.060]  But thank you for the call.
[03:34:21.140 --> 03:34:22.300]  Yeah, thank you for the call.
[03:34:22.600 --> 03:34:23.880]  Really great points, Graham.
[03:34:24.841 --> 03:34:28.742]  It just frustrates me because we're eating cross-species every day.
[03:34:28.962 --> 03:34:29.422]  I know that.
[03:34:30.382 --> 03:34:31.582]  You know, the public doesn't.
[03:34:31.623 --> 03:34:32.443]  I just keep telling them.
[03:34:32.803 --> 03:34:34.183]  Ben in New York, you're on the air.
[03:34:35.304 --> 03:34:35.884]  Hi, Alex.
[03:34:36.044 --> 03:34:39.425]  I'm a huge fan, long-term fan, a subscriber to presentplanet.com.
[03:34:40.025 --> 03:34:44.126]  I had one comment to make really quick, and then I'll ask a question to both of you guys really quick.
[03:34:44.725 --> 03:34:55.469]  Uh, the comment, first of all, was I've been reading, uh, Tex Marz's book, Circle of Intrigue, recently, and it talks about how there's in a circle, you know, ten members, possibly, of that, and that there could be an eleventh eventually.
[03:34:56.701 --> 03:34:59.442]  If Jordan has any comments about that group, I'll ask him.
[03:34:59.622 --> 03:35:11.244]  Yeah, I've had people, high-level military, high-level government, and others high-level government, tell me that there is a ruling council and that there is an empty chair at the end of it and they believe an entity is in it.
[03:35:11.584 --> 03:35:13.104]  Jordan, have you gotten that information?
[03:35:13.124 --> 03:35:14.044]  That's exactly what I've heard.
[03:35:14.184 --> 03:35:14.724]  Same thing.
[03:35:14.744 --> 03:35:19.865]  That they believe that there is another entity in the room and they leave an open chair for it.
[03:35:21.106 --> 03:35:22.946]  Yeah, I've heard that many times from people.
[03:35:23.875 --> 03:35:30.321]  A lot of things I've heard that we can't talk about on the air, but a lot of strange stuff going on in the world.
[03:35:42.995 --> 03:35:47.938]  Yeah, there's millions of fake low-level groups.
[03:35:48.259 --> 03:35:48.779]  That's right.
[03:35:48.899 --> 03:35:55.264]  Okay, and there's all these wannabes and a bunch of arrogant people, egomaniacs who think they're getting all this power.
[03:35:55.324 --> 03:35:56.124]  It's ridiculous.
[03:35:56.304 --> 03:36:01.508]  Yeah, but that very term, golden dawn.
[03:36:01.788 --> 03:36:03.329]  See, the rising sun.
[03:36:03.389 --> 03:36:04.130]  That's right.
[03:36:04.390 --> 03:36:09.894]  It's all part of a very, as I said, a very legitimate, du jour, real
[03:36:10.479 --> 03:36:14.680]  Well, one last thing I was going to ask regarding this circle of intrigue and the issues around that is
[03:36:38.141 --> 03:36:42.043]  Jordan, do you think there's actually a connection with this in a circle to the British Royals?
[03:36:43.884 --> 03:36:45.084]  Right at the top, man.
[03:36:45.424 --> 03:36:47.245]  That's like asking if the Pope is Catholic.
[03:36:47.885 --> 03:36:51.047]  That's the head of the Germanic Zionist cult.
[03:36:51.247 --> 03:36:51.687]  That's right.
[03:36:51.787 --> 03:36:53.228]  It's a Teutonic cult.
[03:36:54.028 --> 03:36:58.770]  And they're promoting something called Zionism, which has zero nothing to do with being Jewish.
[03:36:58.790 --> 03:37:05.053]  Well, they also want to carry out their New World Order in the name of the Jews, because they want to kill the Jews, because they want to put themselves in that place.
[03:37:07.486 --> 03:37:14.370]  And so, I've said so many times, Christians use the word Christ, but have no idea in the world what the word Christ means.
[03:37:14.891 --> 03:37:20.134]  Therefore, if you don't know what Christ means, then you're never going to understand what an anti-Christ would be.
[03:37:20.234 --> 03:37:22.856]  An anti- does not mean to be against.
[03:37:22.876 --> 03:37:26.258]  An anti-Christ does not mean against Christ.
[03:37:26.878 --> 03:37:30.260]  It means to be in the place of Christ.
[03:37:31.521 --> 03:37:36.484]  A substitute in the place of Christ, because in the ancient Greek language, anti-
[03:37:36.929 --> 03:37:40.310]  Was a word which means to be in the place of, not against.
[03:37:40.570 --> 03:37:41.110]  Counterfeit.
[03:37:41.930 --> 03:37:43.350]  Exactly, a counterfeit.
[03:37:43.490 --> 03:37:46.411]  Yeah, let's go ahead and talk, and that's what the globalist are masters of.
[03:37:46.471 --> 03:37:48.091]  And they have the whole public hypnotized.
[03:37:48.371 --> 03:37:55.973]  More and more I realize, they've done studies, people are many times more suggestible and easily hypnotized now by street hypnotists than they were.
[03:37:55.993 --> 03:37:59.053]  And it's because they're in an admitted lower brainwave.
[03:37:59.073 --> 03:37:59.754]  You can prove this.
[03:37:59.994 --> 03:38:01.654]  They're in a sleeping brainwave.
[03:38:01.894 --> 03:38:02.274]  You're right.
[03:38:02.654 --> 03:38:03.295]  They sleep.
[03:38:04.255 --> 03:38:06.076]  That's what they say in They Live with John Carpenter.
[03:38:06.416 --> 03:38:08.377]  You know, we sleep, they live.
[03:38:08.637 --> 03:38:09.037]  You're right.
[03:38:09.118 --> 03:38:10.118]  They're really alive.
[03:38:10.138 --> 03:38:11.038]  They're seeing things.
[03:38:11.078 --> 03:38:11.639]  They're living.
[03:38:12.379 --> 03:38:13.039]  We're alive.
[03:38:13.119 --> 03:38:15.881]  That's why they hate us that fight them, because we're actually alive, too.
[03:38:16.401 --> 03:38:16.721]  I know.
[03:38:17.121 --> 03:38:20.523]  And we're trying to unlock the slaves so we can save ourselves.
[03:38:20.723 --> 03:38:21.984]  Hurry, un-key yourself!
[03:38:22.024 --> 03:38:23.144]  God, they're destroying us!
[03:38:23.184 --> 03:38:26.706]  And they're just drooling like, ugghhh!
[03:38:26.726 --> 03:38:29.087]  Go and watch that movie with Rod...
[03:38:31.115 --> 03:38:31.375]  Hi, gents.
[03:38:31.415 --> 03:38:33.257]  I really appreciate the show letting me on.
[03:38:51.322 --> 03:38:52.823]  This is for the guest.
[03:38:52.923 --> 03:39:02.327]  If I had one of his books or one document that he could share with me that I could help convince my friends and family that I'm not crazy, what would that be?
[03:39:02.667 --> 03:39:11.911]  I think if you go on my website to the homepage, the book called Occult Theocracy.
[03:39:12.932 --> 03:39:20.295]  Occult Theocracy is just a reference book on all of the secret societies around the world, where they come from,
[03:39:20.757 --> 03:39:23.618]  It's just a reference book so people can see for the first time.
[03:39:23.638 --> 03:39:24.599]  JordanMaxwell.com.
[03:39:24.619 --> 03:39:25.439]  We got to move fast.
[03:39:25.479 --> 03:39:26.800]  Put a couple in and I've got to go.
[03:39:27.360 --> 03:39:32.923]  Let me just say this in relation to them laughing at you.
[03:39:35.321 --> 03:39:36.602]  That is their insecurity.
[03:39:36.642 --> 03:39:38.123]  That's their pre-programming.
[03:39:38.484 --> 03:39:39.765]  And it's pearls before swine.
[03:39:39.825 --> 03:39:45.150]  If somebody really is arguing and debating and getting mad, talk to them.
[03:39:45.170 --> 03:39:46.611]  But move on.
[03:39:46.631 --> 03:39:48.833]  A lot of times family doesn't respect family.
[03:39:48.853 --> 03:39:51.215]  If they want to giggle at you, move on, man.
[03:39:51.516 --> 03:39:53.758]  You're trying to give them something special.
[03:39:54.238 --> 03:39:57.741]  Let me tell you, as soon as you got that attitude, hey Mac, that's fine, be an ignoramus.
[03:39:58.321 --> 03:40:01.384]  But when you're like, I know this sounds crazy, but I mean, that's what I found.
[03:40:01.764 --> 03:40:04.226]  I found that when you grovel to them, they just laugh at you.
[03:40:04.587 --> 03:40:08.090]  But if you just tell them, hey, I'm warning you about something serious, they may listen.
[03:40:08.130 --> 03:40:08.430]  Jordan?
[03:40:08.970 --> 03:40:09.471]  Well, I know.
[03:40:09.611 --> 03:40:09.971]  You're right.
[03:40:10.672 --> 03:40:11.573]  I wanted your take on that.
[03:40:11.633 --> 03:40:13.674]  Okay, but let's go ahead and talk to Scott in Florida.
[03:40:13.714 --> 03:40:14.675]  Fast, Scott, go ahead.
[03:40:14.695 --> 03:40:16.176]  How you doing, gentlemen?
[03:40:16.196 --> 03:40:17.217]  Thanks for getting me on here.
[03:40:17.297 --> 03:40:19.459]  I'm honored to be able to talk to you, Mr. Maxwell.
[03:40:19.479 --> 03:40:19.839]  Thank you.
[03:40:22.468 --> 03:40:24.850]  I started studying this New World Order stuff for about a year.
[03:40:24.870 --> 03:40:26.031]  I've opened Pandora's box.
[03:40:26.051 --> 03:40:28.152]  There's one question I've been trying to get an answer to.
[03:40:28.732 --> 03:40:34.416]  You mentioned Eustace Mullins earlier and he's referenced throughout various books and topics on the subject.
[03:40:35.397 --> 03:40:38.519]  And you also mentioned John Birch Society.
[03:40:38.539 --> 03:40:40.420]  I've heard you mention that as one of your inspirations.
[03:40:40.945 --> 03:40:48.948]  I came across something where you, Mullins, actually said that the John Birch Society was funded and started by Nelson Rockefeller.
[03:40:49.048 --> 03:40:50.649]  Let me just stop you for a minute, sir.
[03:40:51.029 --> 03:40:57.652]  This is the type of small-mindedness, and I'm not saying you're small-minded and I appreciate your call, but in the interest of time, you can call me back tomorrow and we can talk more about it.
[03:40:58.332 --> 03:41:07.861]  I was saying I was a limited person who was to the limited kind of like a John Birch type view, not that I was even John Birch.
[03:41:08.481 --> 03:41:14.787]  And then Jordan Maxwell was saying he was sending them material trying to get them to see a bigger picture.
[03:41:15.207 --> 03:41:17.389]  And then we don't even totally agree with Eustace Mullins.
[03:41:17.409 --> 03:41:21.813]  We were saying he was a pioneer on banking with Ezra Pound.
[03:41:22.433 --> 03:41:28.835]  So, see, we were having a separate, nuanced discussion, and then it degenerates into who's good, who's not.
[03:41:30.055 --> 03:41:33.216]  Obviously, the government was going to try to infiltrate something like the John Birch Society.
[03:41:33.596 --> 03:41:40.658]  I had McManus say here a few years ago that they probably kicked infiltrators out, so I'm not here to certify or uncertify.
[03:41:40.698 --> 03:41:46.100]  This is about your journey of awakening, not in the peanut gallery, who's good and who's not.
[03:41:46.320 --> 03:41:48.281]  We're not here certifying produce.
[03:41:48.341 --> 03:41:49.061]  Jordan Maxwell.
[03:41:49.281 --> 03:42:05.307]  No, you're right, and what I was doing back in the 60s, sending articles to them, I was just interested and I was reading some of their material and I thought this was very interesting stuff and I've got some collaborating evidence, so I just write a little article and send it to them.
[03:42:05.327 --> 03:42:07.989]  And I found their fruits to be good, so I say they're good.
[03:42:08.069 --> 03:42:09.289]  I think there's a problem with it.
[03:42:09.449 --> 03:42:13.271]  Yeah, I mean, I think they're limited, you know, it's kind of junior high level.
[03:42:13.611 --> 03:42:18.873]  Yeah, but the problem is that that was a long time ago and a lot of things have happened since then.
[03:42:19.434 --> 03:42:27.279]  But I just felt that they were doing great work and I wanted to contribute what research I was doing back in 1661.
[03:42:27.919 --> 03:42:36.104]  My whole point is that half our movement spends half its time just debating who's good and who's not and who's this and who's that.
[03:42:36.344 --> 03:42:38.965]  Folks, we're under biological and chemical attack.
[03:42:40.146 --> 03:42:43.488]  Whatever group it is, we better start waking the cattle up fast.
[03:42:43.928 --> 03:42:45.169]  I'm moving ultra-fast now.
[03:42:45.249 --> 03:42:45.889]  Joe and Philly.
[03:42:47.210 --> 03:42:48.191]  Hey Alex, how are you?
[03:42:49.605 --> 03:42:53.906]  Hey, I've been a Prison Planet TV member.
[03:42:53.926 --> 03:42:54.266]  Thank you.
[03:42:54.366 --> 03:42:56.107]  Jordan, I listen to you all the time.
[03:42:56.127 --> 03:42:59.868]  I lived in Washington, D.C.
[03:42:59.888 --> 03:43:01.048]  for 25 years.
[03:43:01.168 --> 03:43:03.209]  I was in banking for 23 years.
[03:43:03.289 --> 03:43:04.949]  I was a regulator for 8 years.
[03:43:05.590 --> 03:43:11.351]  Trust me, I know what you're saying is the truth, and I would love to speak to you offline.
[03:43:11.451 --> 03:43:12.732]  Well, you've got my phone number.
[03:43:12.792 --> 03:43:13.952]  Just go on my website.
[03:43:14.753 --> 03:43:20.034]  And I can't say what I need to say in the audience.
[03:43:20.054 --> 03:43:25.656]  No, I mean it was eyes wide shut, occultism, that's what you saw, wasn't it, sir?
[03:43:25.676 --> 03:43:26.556]  Well, we know what goes on, brother.
[03:43:26.576 --> 03:43:27.096]  Let me tell you this.
[03:43:27.116 --> 03:43:27.716]  These people don't stop.
[03:43:27.736 --> 03:43:28.976]  There is no backing down.
[03:43:28.996 --> 03:43:30.017]  These people don't back down.
[03:43:30.097 --> 03:43:30.797]  I understand that.
[03:43:44.045 --> 03:43:45.246]  Yeah, we don't either!
[03:43:59.699 --> 03:44:01.821]  Secret admirer of you for about a year.
[03:44:01.861 --> 03:44:03.322]  Well, listen, it's right there.
[03:44:03.422 --> 03:44:05.924]  Sir, sir, in the interest of time, call me back tomorrow.
[03:44:06.224 --> 03:44:07.405]  My contact info's here.
[03:44:07.445 --> 03:44:08.206]  Send me an email.
[03:44:08.666 --> 03:44:18.233]  I mean, the point is, is that I know Hollywood people, banking people, they're all, you know, basically either don't like the New World Order and know it's a cult, or they're a cult and start telling you how great Lucifer is.
[03:44:18.634 --> 03:44:19.995]  I mean, believe me, that's what I mean.
[03:44:20.035 --> 03:44:24.078]  The public has no idea, and you're saying, listen, I know, I've been around the elite.
[03:44:24.438 --> 03:44:25.599]  I know, that's what's crazy.
[03:44:25.819 --> 03:44:27.100]  We're trying to warn these people.
[03:44:27.160 --> 03:44:28.120]  Thank you so much, Joe.
[03:44:28.340 --> 03:44:29.981]  Listen, I've got to let Jordan Maxwell go.
[03:44:30.041 --> 03:44:31.222]  I can't take any more of his time.
[03:44:31.642 --> 03:44:34.904]  I'm sorry to Elroy, Matt, Ed, and Kevin.
[03:44:35.284 --> 03:44:35.584]  You know what?
[03:44:35.604 --> 03:44:36.545]  I'm going to leave it up to Jordan.
[03:44:36.625 --> 03:44:37.585]  Well, I'm putting him in the hot seat.
[03:44:37.825 --> 03:44:39.626]  Jordan, do you want to do four more minutes?
[03:44:39.666 --> 03:44:40.407]  Yeah, let's do it.
[03:44:40.487 --> 03:44:41.287]  All right, let's do it.
[03:44:41.347 --> 03:44:41.748]  Four more.
[03:44:42.088 --> 03:44:43.368]  Dave in Colorado, fast.
[03:44:44.489 --> 03:44:44.989]  Hi, Alex.
[03:44:45.770 --> 03:44:51.233]  We talked on June the 13th, and I'm so happy to be able to talk to Jordan for just one second.
[03:44:51.293 --> 03:44:55.415]  I just want to ask, what's the best resource material on the bohemian grove?
[03:44:55.879 --> 03:45:02.062]  In your work or anybody else's in terms of the occult history, where they get their rituals, whatever you've got, what's the deal?
[03:45:02.082 --> 03:45:06.403]  Well, alright, Alex has all the best stuff on Bohemian Grove.
[03:45:06.563 --> 03:45:15.247]  All I would add is that you need to understand what the word grove, go on my website to the research boxes and it's
[03:45:16.191 --> 03:45:19.072]  Under a religious research box.
[03:45:19.232 --> 03:45:27.014]  But a grove is a larger conclave of warlocks and witches, and the groves is where they did the sacrifices and the rituals, correct sir?
[03:45:27.254 --> 03:45:27.475]  Right.
[03:45:27.735 --> 03:45:42.039]  But what you need to do is go on my website and go to the research boxes, and especially the ones dealing with religion, and scroll down until you hit the one on grove, and read some of that material on what a grove represented.
[03:45:42.518 --> 03:45:45.759]  In the occult world, it doesn't mean what you think it does.
[03:45:46.279 --> 03:45:49.200]  Most people think groves are where there are lots of trees.
[03:45:49.420 --> 03:45:53.881]  No, that's not exactly the way they're using it.
[03:45:54.381 --> 03:45:57.822]  Yes, there is a grove of trees where they are operating.
[03:45:57.842 --> 03:45:59.423]  But it's an outdoor cathedral.
[03:45:59.643 --> 03:46:00.163]  That's right.
[03:46:00.283 --> 03:46:02.763]  It means something even deeper yet.
[03:46:03.564 --> 03:46:04.464]  So it's not just
[03:46:05.075 --> 03:46:07.717]  A bunch of trees that create a grove.
[03:46:07.737 --> 03:46:11.099]  And by the way, at the grove, they call it Moloch, but say it's an owl.
[03:46:11.480 --> 03:46:13.721]  I know fully well that Moloch was a bull.
[03:46:14.121 --> 03:46:14.822]  That's exactly right.
[03:46:14.862 --> 03:46:16.783]  But in the occult, they interchange things.
[03:46:16.803 --> 03:46:17.804]  Can you explain that to people?
[03:46:18.224 --> 03:46:23.788]  Yeah, well because the owl represents the wisdom of seeing things in the dark.
[03:46:24.677 --> 03:46:27.978]  Owls are known to be warriors because they can see things in the dark.
[03:46:27.998 --> 03:46:32.980]  But as a female, it manifests as an owl, and then they also manifest as a bull.
[03:46:33.300 --> 03:46:36.261]  During the ceremony, they are addressing it as male and female.
[03:46:36.461 --> 03:46:40.083]  Well, I know, because there is a whole occult... I know you know!
[03:46:40.163 --> 03:46:42.964]  I'm just trying to let the listeners keep going.
[03:46:43.564 --> 03:46:45.285]  It's not an owl, Alex.
[03:46:45.325 --> 03:46:46.125]  It's not Moloch.
[03:46:46.165 --> 03:46:48.366]  And I'm going, they're calling it Moloch.
[03:46:49.877 --> 03:46:50.697]  It's unbelievable.
[03:46:50.797 --> 03:46:51.138]  I know.
[03:46:51.278 --> 03:46:53.598]  Okay, let's take one real fast.
[03:46:53.818 --> 03:46:55.739]  Let's go to Elroy in Minnesota, fast.
[03:46:56.659 --> 03:46:58.020]  Yeah, hi Jordan, real quick.
[03:46:58.680 --> 03:47:04.102]  Are you familiar with the Kensington Runestone that was discovered in Minnesota in 1898?
[03:47:04.182 --> 03:47:10.144]  It has recently been discovered that it was actually carved by Teutonic Knights, and there's a secret code in it.
[03:47:10.624 --> 03:47:10.864]  Yep, yep.
[03:47:10.904 --> 03:47:16.586]  As a matter of fact, I've got some material on that I've been looking at rather recently.
[03:47:18.284 --> 03:47:21.112]  It's too big of a subject to go into in the last few moments.
[03:47:24.002 --> 03:47:28.445]  A great book on it that was written by Scott Walter, he's the foremost authority on it.
[03:47:28.525 --> 03:47:33.248]  Yeah, what it was is that Vikings weren't just the Vikings we think of in modern times.
[03:47:33.308 --> 03:47:50.178]  They were trading with the Chinese, they were trading with the Arabs, they were trading with, and this is in the mainline history books, just no one knows it, they were all over the New World and they dug up their graves everywhere and found hundreds of their swords, and so they're saying they're going to recreate that Atlantean Teutonic Empire, correct?
[03:47:50.498 --> 03:47:51.979]  That's right.
[03:47:52.179 --> 03:47:55.561]  And actually, it's a Lance claimed document is what they think it is.
[03:47:55.621 --> 03:47:56.802]  Well, go on my website.
[03:47:56.842 --> 03:47:58.103]  Yeah, they're saying this is ours.
[03:47:58.623 --> 03:48:00.204]  Yeah.
[03:48:00.284 --> 03:48:04.567]  And then it was maps that Columbus, who was a Mason, got.
[03:48:05.447 --> 03:48:07.789]  So the reason they say he discovered is he reclaimed.
[03:48:07.849 --> 03:48:08.429]  Correct, Jordan?
[03:48:08.449 --> 03:48:09.370]  Yeah, he reclaimed.
[03:48:09.490 --> 03:48:10.030]  Absolutely.
[03:48:10.230 --> 03:48:10.370]  Yeah.
[03:48:11.271 --> 03:48:13.592]  Okay, we got to take one more and then that's it.
[03:48:14.293 --> 03:48:15.153]  We'll take Matt and Kevin.
[03:48:15.193 --> 03:48:16.194]  Matt in Florida, hit me.
[03:48:17.481 --> 03:48:18.121]  Hey, Alex.
[03:48:18.181 --> 03:48:19.561]  Hey, Jordan.
[03:48:19.902 --> 03:48:22.502]  How you doing?
[03:48:22.602 --> 03:48:23.702]  Oh, okay.
[03:48:23.762 --> 03:48:24.683]  That's very good.
[03:48:25.223 --> 03:48:27.243]  Listen, there's something on your website.
[03:48:27.263 --> 03:48:28.423]  It's by Thorkelson.
[03:48:28.463 --> 03:48:34.805]  It was the account of his speech in Congress in 1940, and he talks about two different groups.
[03:48:34.845 --> 03:48:40.426]  He talks about an Anglo-American influence, and he talks about an internationalist influence.
[03:48:40.446 --> 03:48:42.006]  But it's the same people.
[03:48:42.426 --> 03:48:44.967]  He puts it in a context that there's actually
[03:48:45.456 --> 03:48:52.503]  I think that's a lie for their lower level members, and they allow jousting between their subgroups, but there really is no split at the top.
[03:49:07.150 --> 03:49:10.172]  They promote the fight, but what they're doing is promoting both fighters.
[03:49:10.592 --> 03:49:14.274]  And it's actually the guys sitting around the ring with the cigars that are making the money.
[03:49:14.735 --> 03:49:16.015]  So they're promoting the fight.
[03:49:16.696 --> 03:49:21.179]  He quickly got his book called the National American Establishment.
[03:49:21.639 --> 03:49:23.060]  Why did he write that?
[03:49:23.300 --> 03:49:34.147]  Well, no, he admits, if you really read in there, and I gotta let you go, if you read in there, he really admits, he says, we worked through communists, we worked through fascists, and you're saying, he's saying there's two different groups.
[03:49:34.527 --> 03:49:36.028]  They will say it both ways.
[03:49:37.244 --> 03:49:38.465]  Of course.
[03:49:38.525 --> 03:49:40.848]  The bankers don't care who's on first.
[03:49:40.948 --> 03:49:43.630]  It doesn't matter who's on first.
[03:49:43.971 --> 03:49:45.372]  They control the money, period.
[03:49:45.612 --> 03:49:49.997]  They control the flow of ideas and everyone's... One last call.
[03:49:50.157 --> 03:49:50.838]  Kevin in Oregon.
[03:49:51.078 --> 03:49:52.239]  Kevin, go ahead, you'll take us out.
[03:49:52.779 --> 03:49:55.062]  Hey guys, great to talk to you both.
[03:49:55.102 --> 03:49:57.384]  You're both heroes and patriots to us all.
[03:49:58.285 --> 03:50:01.268]  I just wanted to ask Jordan, what do you think of
[03:50:01.775 --> 03:50:05.800]  The Planet X stuff, going back to the Sumerian text.
[03:50:06.060 --> 03:50:19.877]  I actually helped finance, what's his name, Sitchin, Zachariah Sitchin, and I sent him around the world to six different countries and I sat and talked with him for hours on end.
[03:50:20.907 --> 03:50:22.488]  It's a very interesting subject.
[03:50:22.928 --> 03:50:30.511]  Here's the deal, we know planetary bodies come through, but modern people claim it's coming in six months and then discredit all the work.
[03:50:30.771 --> 03:50:32.192]  Right, and that's what I would say.
[03:50:32.272 --> 03:50:34.492]  I don't think there's much to the whole thing.
[03:50:35.613 --> 03:50:39.134]  It's just one more subject out there that we could sit and talk about for days.
[03:50:39.794 --> 03:50:42.315]  I don't see it as that important.
[03:50:42.335 --> 03:50:47.237]  I don't even see the 2012 thing, but the Mayan calendar is very important.
[03:50:49.565 --> 03:50:53.387]  It's a calendar date, and nothing more than that.
[03:50:54.008 --> 03:50:56.369]  I don't see any of that being very important.
[03:50:56.389 --> 03:51:03.754]  What it says, whether you put stock in it or not, is that it means a new age begins, not that the world ends.
[03:51:03.894 --> 03:51:06.536]  Like I said, it's a calendar event.
[03:51:06.616 --> 03:51:12.819]  It's just going from December of one year to the January of the next year, and so there's a change going on.
[03:51:14.469 --> 03:51:20.291]  And I think that's exactly what the powers that be behind the scenes know that.
[03:51:20.471 --> 03:51:27.273]  And they have to make everything a lie, like the new millennium was 2001, but they love the fact that everybody celebrated a new year in the wrong year.
[03:51:27.794 --> 03:51:31.395]  2000, and didn't realize it's not a new millennium yet.
[03:51:31.795 --> 03:51:34.016]  Well, and they believe in lesser magic.
[03:51:34.297 --> 03:51:36.598]  They get power out of deceiving masses.
[03:51:36.618 --> 03:51:37.559]  You're right.
[03:51:37.879 --> 03:51:39.860]  They make money at the same time.
[03:51:40.060 --> 03:51:44.483]  Well, Jordan Maxwell, thank you for two hours and fifty minutes.
[03:51:44.683 --> 03:51:45.764]  I'll call you in a couple days.

[03:51:47.825 --> 03:51:51.287]  And I do want to try to work with you on some things.
[03:51:52.388 --> 03:51:53.429]  You're just a real treasure.

[03:51:57.791 --> 03:51:58.452]  Take care, my friend.
[03:51:59.333 --> 03:51:59.834]  Thank you again.
