[00:00:04.432 --> 00:00:05.873]  I don't have to tell you things are bad.
[00:00:06.353 --> 00:00:07.494]  Everybody knows things are bad.
[00:00:08.134 --> 00:00:08.875]  It's a depression.
[00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:13.038]  Everybody's out of work or scared of losing their job.
[00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:15.900]  The dollar buys a nickel's worth.
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.401]  Banks are going bust.
[00:00:17.461 --> 00:00:19.382]  Shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter.
[00:00:20.022 --> 00:00:21.603]  Punks are running wild in the street.
[00:00:21.643 --> 00:00:24.225]  There's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do and there's no end to it.
[00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:28.268]  We know the air is unfit to breathe.
[00:00:28.368 --> 00:00:29.769]  Our food is unfit to eat.
[00:00:30.538 --> 00:00:39.061]  We sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had 15 homicides and 63 violent crimes as if that's the way it's supposed to be.
[00:00:39.341 --> 00:00:41.401]  We know things are bad, worse than bad.
[00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:42.742]  They're crazy.
[00:00:42.982 --> 00:00:45.963]  It's like everything everywhere is going crazy so we don't go out anymore.
[00:00:46.363 --> 00:00:53.265]  We sit in the house and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller and all we say is, please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms.
[00:00:53.305 --> 00:00:57.666]  Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radios and I won't say anything.
[00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:58.686]  Just leave us alone.
[00:00:58.927 --> 00:01:00.247]  Well, I'm not gonna leave you alone.
[00:01:01.175 --> 00:01:02.336]  I want you to get mad!
[00:01:02.356 --> 00:01:04.437]  I don't want you to protest.
[00:01:04.537 --> 00:01:05.557]  I don't want you to riot.
[00:01:05.577 --> 00:01:08.538]  I don't want you to write to your congressmen because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write.
[00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:13.201]  I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street.
[00:01:13.541 --> 00:01:16.062]  All I know is that first, you've got to get mad!
[00:01:16.522 --> 00:01:18.403]  You've got to say, I'm a human being!
[00:01:18.643 --> 00:01:19.844]  My life has value!
[00:01:21.464 --> 00:01:24.106]  I want you to get up now.
[00:01:24.926 --> 00:01:26.967]  I want all of you to get up out of your chairs.
[00:01:28.274 --> 00:01:38.728]  I want you to get up right now, to go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell, I'm tired of hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!
[00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:40.871]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:40.891 --> 00:01:41.231]  Thank you
[00:01:43.134 --> 00:01:44.214]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:01:44.234 --> 00:01:52.556]  We'll be live at PrisonPlanet.tv, streaming to PrisonPlanet.tv members for the next hour and 15 minutes until the end of the radio show.
[00:01:53.176 --> 00:01:55.176]  Alan Watt is with us for the balance of the broadcast today.
[00:01:55.196 --> 00:02:03.338]  We're going to cover the news with him in the next 30 minutes and then open phones for Alan Watt and of course myself, Alex Jones, for the rest of this transmission.
[00:02:03.678 --> 00:02:04.538]  December 17, 2008.
[00:02:05.118 --> 00:02:10.919]  Seems like this year just started a few days ago and now it is already almost over.
[00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.434]  Interest rates have been cut by zero, further destroying the dollar.
[00:02:15.854 --> 00:02:18.317]  The Federal Reserve is openly taking over the United States.
[00:02:18.337 --> 00:02:19.879]  8.5 trillion stolen.
[00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:21.020]  That number is two weeks old.
[00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:25.946]  They're telling Congress and the media, even after four-year suits, that they will not release the information.
[00:02:25.966 --> 00:02:28.028]  Remember, they promised it would all be public.
[00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:30.390]  This is all by design.
[00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:42.635]  And scores of news articles and the Army War College are reporting that the military is training to attack the American people and rules of engagement to not just use microwave guns and sound cannons, but bullets.
[00:02:42.675 --> 00:02:45.416]  It says the American people are going to rebel against them.
[00:02:45.436 --> 00:02:48.137]  The Ministry of Defense last year in England admitted this.
[00:02:48.817 --> 00:02:52.460]  The Defense Department this year has admitted it in a new report out on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:00.227]  I want to talk to Alan Watt with known and unknown unconventional strategic shocks in defense strategy development.
[00:03:00.707 --> 00:03:04.550]  And this gets into, it says right here, their fight with the American people.
[00:03:04.971 --> 00:03:12.397]  So the question is, will the social engineers be able to bring in this worldwide depression that they engineered publicly and then pose as saviors and then set up
[00:03:12.797 --> 00:03:13.558]  It's a pleasure to be on.
[00:03:39.784 --> 00:03:54.393]  Alan, I know you're a newshound like myself because I follow your work, and I know you've been covering the fact that hundreds of major newspapers, including the Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times of London, and others, are all reporting that, yes, we had a secret world government,
[00:03:54.893 --> 00:03:56.814]  Yes, we set up a secret world government.
[00:03:57.194 --> 00:04:00.036]  Yes, we've been soothing you and lying to you.
[00:04:00.096 --> 00:04:08.220]  They even say this, for your own good, in the article, and now for world government, by Mr. Reikman in the Financial Times of London last Tuesday.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:19.446]  They admit that it's tyrannical, anti-democratic, but they say it's for your own good to save us from global warming and terrorism, which we know they're staging, and the financial crisis, which we know they're implementing.
[00:04:20.146 --> 00:04:30.498]  Why are they now in hundreds of publications, hundreds, you can Google New World Order and Google News, thousands, around 5,400 links come up in the last few months.
[00:04:30.658 --> 00:04:33.201]  Why are they suddenly announcing it?
[00:04:33.841 --> 00:04:39.388]  Don't they understand that the people finally are seeing that it's real and that they are the authors of our doom?
[00:04:39.488 --> 00:04:41.029]  Why is New York announcing
[00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:48.013]  New York State, 88 new taxes on food and drink and iPods and taxis.
[00:04:48.434 --> 00:04:51.956]  Why are they trying to squeeze us into conflict?
[00:04:51.996 --> 00:04:58.119]  So A, why are they openly announcing their world government, admitting it's tyrannical, anti-democratic, social engineering?
[00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:04.182]  And B, why are they pushing us with all these new taxes, knowing it will cause rebellion as we've seen worldwide?
[00:05:05.343 --> 00:05:09.305]  What they're doing is simply implementing the next part of this plan.
[00:05:09.997 --> 00:05:18.904]  They've had years of creating what they call apathy, and they started that agenda back in the 60s, in fact, the creation of apathy.
[00:05:19.225 --> 00:05:27.712]  The idea was to estrange the people from the idea that somehow they took part in making the future, deciding the future.
[00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.599]  Thanks.
[00:05:45.934 --> 00:05:46.555]  I think?
[00:06:02.446 --> 00:06:02.906]  Thank you.
[00:06:21.758 --> 00:06:24.420]  And get ready for tough, tough times coming.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.740]  Just accept it.
[00:06:26.081 --> 00:06:29.223]  They're trying to tell you it's so overwhelming, there's nothing you can do.
[00:06:29.703 --> 00:06:30.984]  That really is the message.
[00:06:31.024 --> 00:06:33.105]  It's psychological warfare to the extreme.
[00:06:35.424 --> 00:06:53.944]  Well, I concur with you, and in fact, as you know, they talk about in hundreds and hundreds of declassified government psychology tests, starting with rats and then with other primates and then humans, that if they just shock you with overwhelming information that it creates a feeling of hopelessness in many people.
[00:06:54.705 --> 00:06:54.965]  Go ahead.
[00:07:10.012 --> 00:07:13.114]  Everybody becomes mad killers who will kill for food.
[00:07:13.654 --> 00:07:19.437]  So it looks like they're pushing us into a crisis where they know we won't just be apathetic and we'll actually fight back.
[00:07:19.457 --> 00:07:20.177]  Look at Greece.
[00:07:20.637 --> 00:07:21.398]  Look at Iceland.
[00:07:21.418 --> 00:07:22.318]  Look at Argentina.
[00:07:22.738 --> 00:07:25.680]  All over the world, riots now starting worldwide.
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:31.422]  We have the establishment then trying to push those riots with Martin coming out today and
[00:07:32.903 --> 00:07:45.750]  Well, not Martin now, Harper coming out saying we're going to have a depression with the head of the IMF saying we're going to have worldwide rioting if we don't fix the economy when we know they engineered the crisis.
[00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:59.237]  So, with your expertise, try to break down for us, please, what exactly is happening here and what this cocktail is of trying to get us to rebel and fight back while at the same time trying to soothe us and getting us to go along.
[00:08:00.017 --> 00:08:04.279]  Oh, I have to look at first, there's not so much what's happening, but what's the long term goal?
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:24.831]  And when they tell you they're going to have rioting for about 30 years worldwide, and they're telling you as well, that they have to get the world to accept, accept the fact that rapid deployment and reaction troops will be sent all over the globe, from one country to the other, to each other as well.
[00:08:25.676 --> 00:08:40.542]  And you're going to see that in 30 years of psychological training, with riots breaking out in different countries and being quelled one at a time, after 30 years we'll have a brand new society where we accept that the old way is completely eradicated.
[00:08:40.922 --> 00:08:47.745]  The old way of choosing what you want to do with your life, where you're going to go with your life, where you want to live, who you want to marry, all of that stuff.
[00:08:47.945 --> 00:08:51.006]  You want to earn money for yourself, that's gone as well.
[00:08:51.801 --> 00:08:54.683]  It's a brand new world as they come out at the end of this whole agenda.
[00:08:55.183 --> 00:09:02.667]  So we're going to see the sporadic outbreaks in certain parts until it's a standard daily news for 30 years.
[00:09:03.048 --> 00:09:13.754]  The troops have been deployed in Brazil, the troops have been deployed in the Hague, will be deployed in Norway, Finland, the US or parts of the US.
[00:09:14.187 --> 00:09:16.727]  And that will be our standard fear for thirty years.
[00:09:16.847 --> 00:09:34.911]  And we've now seen tens of millions of year given to Mexico alone to suddenly militarize and put troops in black uniforms on every street corner and then start wars with the drug cartels they don't control to further escalate the problem reaction solution crises that they're openly engineering.
[00:09:34.931 --> 00:09:41.332]  I'm going to put up on screen and now for world government from the Financial Times of London
[00:09:42.392 --> 00:09:45.535]  I mean, again, just incredibly arrogant to be throwing this in our face.
[00:09:45.575 --> 00:09:45.996]  Please continue.
[00:09:46.036 --> 00:09:46.636]  It's arrogant.
[00:09:46.736 --> 00:09:47.557]  It's arrogant, too.
[00:09:47.637 --> 00:09:50.320]  And also, when you go into the whole U.N.
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.503]  agenda, you can't really understand this until you look at the U.N.
[00:09:53.543 --> 00:09:58.688]  agenda with all of its umbrella organizations working on the same agenda.
[00:09:59.437 --> 00:10:05.118]  To the state where eventually you will not work for yourself, you'll work for the world state.
[00:10:05.258 --> 00:10:09.279]  You'll get your food given to you by or via the United Nations.
[00:10:09.339 --> 00:10:10.539]  That's in their charter.
[00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:24.163]  They will be in command of all the food resources of entire... And as you mentioned, the British Ministry of Defence public report last year said, we work for the foreign banks, we're going to engineer in the US, England and Europe and Japan 30 years of riots
[00:10:26.343 --> 00:10:31.666]  And our job will be suppressing the people while this transformation to world government is complete.
[00:10:32.207 --> 00:10:49.817]  Yes, and so a generation will grow up through these tough times, and it'll be quite natural to hear on the news that the rapid deployment forces are down in California this week, quelling a riot by malcontents who are anti-social, who won't blend into the new social structure.
[00:10:50.377 --> 00:10:54.960]  And this is how the planet is really working on the minds of those growing up.
[00:10:55.621 --> 00:10:58.504]  Already we have people growing up who've never known freedom.
[00:10:58.544 --> 00:11:07.611]  They think that police in the streets and tanks going around and guys in black uniforms in the subways, machine guns, is quite natural that we're under a constant state of terror.
[00:11:08.032 --> 00:11:09.393]  That's the only world they've known.
[00:11:09.773 --> 00:11:13.236]  The one that will grow up through all the rioting will take that as standard.
[00:11:13.256 --> 00:11:19.201]  They will think that those who riot are anti-social because they want more than their fair share, that the UN is dishing out to them.
[00:11:19.821 --> 00:11:21.543]  And at the end of all of this,
[00:11:21.937 --> 00:11:25.462]  There'll be no memory or history of the world that was before.
[00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:38.218]  And that's what George Orwell talks about who was a BBC propagandist and openly admitted before he died of tuberculosis and a lot of evidence showed was killed that this is the plan he was let in on as a member of British intelligence.
[00:11:38.939 --> 00:11:39.080]  Yes.
[00:11:40.183 --> 00:11:54.833]  And showing that the British masterminds, not the British people, but the British masterminds are running this, everything the British government puts out as policy is then mimicked and parroted as official policy in the United States, Europe, Japan, and worldwide.
[00:11:54.913 --> 00:11:56.033]  Alan Watt is our guest.
[00:11:56.274 --> 00:12:02.638]  We'll talk about the public, even though world government's being admitted, some of the public's still in denial, saying the articles we're showing are fake.
[00:12:03.763 --> 00:12:10.146]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:12:10.526 --> 00:12:12.507]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:12:13.167 --> 00:12:14.208]  But who is the enemy?
[00:12:14.728 --> 00:12:15.228]  Bin Laden.
[00:12:15.508 --> 00:12:16.489]  This is his M.O.s.
[00:12:16.509 --> 00:12:17.849]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:12:17.869 --> 00:12:19.510]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:26.633]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:12:27.033 --> 00:12:27.473]  Some U.S.
[00:12:27.513 --> 00:12:33.176]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:12:33.856 --> 00:12:37.339]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:12:37.359 --> 00:12:47.607]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:12:47.827 --> 00:12:48.588]  Fabled enemies.
[00:12:49.068 --> 00:12:56.354]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:12:56.834 --> 00:13:00.177]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[00:13:04.318 --> 00:13:06.279]  Hi, John Huebner from Midas Resources.
[00:13:06.559 --> 00:13:09.180]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:17.803]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[00:13:18.083 --> 00:13:20.924]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[00:13:21.764 --> 00:13:24.965]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[00:13:26.305 --> 00:13:27.886]  How much are you willing to lose?
[00:13:28.286 --> 00:13:29.187]  Take action now!
[00:13:29.327 --> 00:13:32.970]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[00:13:34.151 --> 00:13:37.913]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[00:13:38.134 --> 00:13:41.336]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[00:13:41.456 --> 00:13:47.881]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[00:13:48.181 --> 00:13:53.710]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[00:13:54.151 --> 00:13:56.274]  Do this while paper can still buy gold.
[00:13:56.475 --> 00:13:58.197]  Call me, John Huebner, at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[00:14:03.809 --> 00:14:07.191]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:14:07.331 --> 00:14:12.535]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:14:12.735 --> 00:14:17.498]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:14:17.878 --> 00:14:29.006]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:14:29.406 --> 00:14:34.950]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:41.254]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:14:41.434 --> 00:14:42.094]  What about you?

[00:15:03.702 --> 00:15:06.282]  Toxic heavy metals negatively impact our health.
[00:15:06.502 --> 00:15:11.723]  They're in the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, the products we use, and the objects we touch.
[00:15:12.043 --> 00:15:13.843]  Exposure is impossible to avoid.
[00:15:14.083 --> 00:15:17.924]  Heavy metals build up within the body over a period of time, causing poor health.
[00:15:18.184 --> 00:15:22.585]  However, with Keylorex, they can be mobilized and excreted in a safe and effective manner.
[00:15:22.865 --> 00:15:23.325]  I think so.
[00:15:43.217 --> 00:15:43.517]  I think so.
[00:16:12.076 --> 00:16:14.818]  They're doing a bad, bad thing right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:28.208]  All right, Alan Watt, as what I'd call an independent sociologist studying all of this, or you can define yourself in, I guess, the work I do.
[00:16:28.228 --> 00:16:33.612]  I mean, I guess a real historian studying the elite and their program for humanity.
[00:16:34.272 --> 00:16:45.076]  You have these hundreds of articles saying world government's here, world government's a good idea, we're going to put one back on screen, admitting it's tyrannical but saying it's for your own good, and I guess that's just more of this terrorism.
[00:16:45.537 --> 00:17:02.644]  Stage terror attacks, stage financial attacks, give us total power or the economy will implode, the Congress gives them total power under threat of martial law, the British Parliament's being spied on, governors are being arrested, all this fear, and then even though hundreds of papers and world leaders are all over TV calling for world government,
[00:17:03.584 --> 00:17:11.291]  I still get emails and comments and talk show hosts and Rush Limbaugh making fun of myself, even by name, saying that none of it exists.
[00:17:11.311 --> 00:17:21.781]  So all these years we read the documents, the CFR reports, Carol Quigley, literally thousands and thousands of them on air, wrote books about it, made films about it.
[00:17:21.801 --> 00:17:26.105]  Now that it's all happening and emerging publicly,
[00:17:27.563 --> 00:17:49.546]  A lot of people are waking up and saying, oh my God, you were right, we've got to fight this, but just as many, I'd say 20-30% of the public, are saying, you know what, they told me previously this didn't exist, so I'm saying you're a liar, I'm saying these news articles are fake, I'm saying none of this is real, and I'm seeing a huge backlash, and I know some of them are operatives and paid bloggers, but I mean,
[00:17:50.791 --> 00:18:01.655]  It just seems like such an insult to the public's intelligence to openly admit it, and then with the other hand, as this Reitman guy did a day after he wrote the article, he wrote another article saying, there is no world government, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:18:01.735 --> 00:18:02.935]  So, can you speak to that?
[00:18:04.175 --> 00:18:11.438]  That, again, is the... Limbaugh and these characters, really, their job is to keep the people in the illusion.
[00:18:11.458 --> 00:18:13.839]  It's exactly like 1984.
[00:18:15.635 --> 00:18:21.799]  Um, the majority of the bureaucratic elite had to believe in the propaganda that was dished out every day.
[00:18:21.819 --> 00:18:24.840]  It didn't matter about those at the very, very bottom.
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:27.262]  They literally will adapt to any system they're given.
[00:18:27.662 --> 00:18:32.805]  However, when there's a rapid change in their standard of living, they will kill the messenger.
[00:18:33.305 --> 00:18:36.307]  So they had the limbaus and characters like that to cater to the masses.
[00:18:37.017 --> 00:18:40.459]  Who want to live in the old think, as they call it, the old system.
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:44.342]  Even though it is changing around them, they will deny their own perceptions.
[00:18:44.502 --> 00:18:45.002]  Exactly.
[00:18:45.022 --> 00:18:52.768]  I always hear Limbaugh and Hannity still saying WMDs were found, even as the UN and Bush admit that it was staged, was fake.
[00:18:53.008 --> 00:18:53.588]  It doesn't matter.
[00:18:53.608 --> 00:18:55.650]  They still say every day, no, it's real.
[00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:57.431]  No, the WMDs were there.
[00:18:57.891 --> 00:19:01.033]  Again, they're kind of living in the old model or the old download.
[00:19:01.594 --> 00:19:01.754]  Yes.
[00:19:02.214 --> 00:19:05.236]  And that's their job is to cater to those who are heavily brainwashed
[00:19:05.649 --> 00:19:09.494]  Who are timid, who are scared, and who could not face a rapid change.
[00:19:09.874 --> 00:19:19.425]  They want to believe that things will somehow get better, but more importantly, they think, they hope it'll go back to the past, and nothing ever goes back to the past.
[00:19:19.514 --> 00:19:21.736]  Well, that's double-think, double-speak, crime-stop.
[00:19:21.856 --> 00:19:36.607]  They subconsciously, it's too scary, they make the decision to lie to themselves and say it's not happening, even as it is happening, as they put troops on the streets, as Marines run checkpoints at DWI, checkpoints on the road against U.S.
[00:19:36.627 --> 00:19:37.148]  citizens.
[00:19:37.568 --> 00:19:49.357]  They come back and say, no, it's not true, and then Limbaugh and others give them psychological sounding board or cover to say, see, there's still a media saying it doesn't exist, even as the other mainline media
[00:19:50.338 --> 00:19:57.286]  Yes, and the rest of the media keeps them in, old thing, with lots and lots and lots of trivia.
[00:19:57.306 --> 00:20:05.295]  That's exactly what Bertrand Russell said, to be fed is nothing but trivia, and trivia is mixed with important news, and so they can't tell the difference.
[00:20:05.395 --> 00:20:10.841]  Everything is surreal to them, surrealistic, and their world they live in is surrealistic.
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:26.487]  And when the troops are, just like the Soviet Union, you know, Solzhenitsyn said, he said at first when the NKVD, which became the KGB, came to arrest people next door to you, they would turn the whole street out under Soviet law to witness the arrest.
[00:20:27.068 --> 00:20:31.430]  That was to have the powerful effect of terrifying the onlookers, you see.
[00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:33.891]  Now they show it to us on Cops in the News.
[00:20:34.231 --> 00:20:36.792]  Yes, and it is basically entertainment now.
[00:20:37.513 --> 00:20:39.774]  I watched, I remember when the Hill Street Blues
[00:20:40.339 --> 00:20:40.639]  That's
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.021]  And on those shows they would torture innocent people.
[00:21:06.041 --> 00:21:06.942]  They would break rules.
[00:21:06.962 --> 00:21:09.623]  They'd say, I want to save a little girl, but I don't have a warrant.
[00:21:09.703 --> 00:21:10.244]  Ah, screw it.
[00:21:10.264 --> 00:21:11.384]  Do it without a warrant.
[00:21:20.529 --> 00:21:25.915]  And they make their new heroes the people that torture and violate the law and set people up.
[00:21:25.955 --> 00:21:35.104]  And now SWAT teams are raiding Amish farmers who give unpasteurized milk to their neighbors or who don't register their farm when there's not even a law.
[00:21:35.685 --> 00:21:42.251]  Now the SWAT teams are used at checkpoints on the highway or to go to people's houses for traffic warrants.
[00:21:43.337 --> 00:21:47.343]  Now the entire police force is being converted over to these ringwraiths.
[00:21:47.503 --> 00:21:48.244]  Excellent points.
[00:21:48.664 --> 00:21:51.148]  Amazing insight from Alan Watt cutting through the Matrix.
[00:21:51.388 --> 00:21:52.770]  We'll put his website up on screen.
[00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:53.230]  Stay with us.
[00:21:54.172 --> 00:21:55.073]  We're on the march.
[00:21:55.574 --> 00:21:57.176]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:58.097 --> 00:22:00.781]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:03.749 --> 00:22:09.614]  Ionic Zone has the lowest prices in the USA on shock treatment ozone generators, starting at $299.
[00:22:09.994 --> 00:22:23.746]  Ionic Zone shock treatment ozone generators are used by remediation contractors and homeowners alike to sterilize homes and cars, making them free from bacteria, molds, viruses, and complete removal of secondhand smoke, pet odors, you name it.
[00:22:23.966 --> 00:22:27.189]  What else can three oxygen atoms, in other words, ozone, do?
[00:22:27.489 --> 00:22:31.973]  Many hospitals sterilize their operating rooms with ozone before and after operations.
[00:22:32.253 --> 00:22:34.134]  And have you ever heard of ozone therapy?
[00:22:34.334 --> 00:22:37.595]  Ionic Zone has a wealth of information on ozone therapy.
[00:22:37.915 --> 00:22:44.518]  Ozone therapy is used, among other things, to raise the body's oxygen level, which studies suggest boosts the immune system.
[00:22:44.738 --> 00:22:51.581]  You can learn more about ozone therapy or Ionic Zone ozone generators by going to ioniczone.com or calling 800-549-9535.
[00:22:54.482 --> 00:23:01.364]  That's IONICZONE.COM or toll free 800-549-9535.
[00:23:01.604 --> 00:23:02.984]  IONIC ZONE.
[00:23:03.985 --> 00:23:09.466]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[00:23:09.706 --> 00:23:10.967]  And we knew what to do.
[00:23:10.987 --> 00:23:12.767]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:23:13.027 --> 00:23:19.449]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:23:20.049 --> 00:23:23.270]  Whitman, EPA Director,
[00:23:23.757 --> 00:23:28.600]  On the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:35.764]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:23:36.064 --> 00:23:39.126]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:23:39.226 --> 00:23:44.449]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:47.531]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:23:48.064 --> 00:23:53.928]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[00:23:54.108 --> 00:23:56.670]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:23:57.051 --> 00:24:02.074]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:24:03.455 --> 00:24:04.936]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:24:05.136 --> 00:24:06.577]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:24:06.878 --> 00:24:09.099]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:14.263]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:24:14.685 --> 00:24:17.527]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[00:24:17.867 --> 00:24:33.776]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[00:24:34.336 --> 00:24:36.318]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[00:24:36.338 --> 00:24:37.638]  I use one every day.
[00:24:38.059 --> 00:24:40.480]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:41.260]  I think so.
[00:25:06.755 --> 00:25:08.216]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:08.256 --> 00:25:10.837]  We are live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:25:10.857 --> 00:25:18.701]  In the future, we'll be going at least two hours a day live, so we can put documents up on screen and show you the articles we're reading live on the radio.
[00:25:19.281 --> 00:25:23.303]  To pay for all this bandwidth in the studio, we charge 15 cents a day or $5.95.
[00:25:24.844 --> 00:25:28.347]  A month, if you get a yearly membership, you get five plus months free.

[00:25:33.852 --> 00:25:40.377]  That is the Christmas special, and so I hope that you will visit PrisonPlanet.tv and sign up today.
[00:25:40.417 --> 00:25:43.099]  We are streaming live to the world right now.
[00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:47.983]  And we also archive this and post it for members at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:25:48.003 --> 00:25:52.065]  We're going to go back to Alan Watt of Cutting Through the Matrix here in just a moment.
[00:25:52.105 --> 00:26:00.791]  Before we do that, I want to tell you about some of the sponsors that make this transmission possible, and one of them is MySolarBackup.com.
[00:26:01.091 --> 00:26:02.792]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power.
[00:26:02.852 --> 00:26:04.333]  Hurricanes, snow, ice, and storms.
[00:26:04.853 --> 00:26:08.415]  Listeners should move towards getting off the grid, and here's a good way to do that.
[00:26:08.855 --> 00:26:11.937]  Because folks, we have to become independent, not dependent on the system.
[00:26:12.237 --> 00:26:16.559]  A solar power generator is now available from our longtime sponsor, Solutions from Science.
[00:26:17.099 --> 00:26:21.642]  It's designed to provide 1800 watts of power on demand in the event of any disaster or outage.
[00:26:22.262 --> 00:26:30.407]  You can get an Emergency Power Backup Kit, which consists of the PowerSource 1800 power plant and a high-efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[00:26:30.747 --> 00:26:32.389]  That's right, it generates free electricity.
[00:26:32.429 --> 00:26:38.592]  Remember, too, that gas generators need gas, but in blackouts, gas pumps can't pump gas because they run on electricity.
[00:26:38.913 --> 00:26:42.595]  The solar power generator is like having a silent power plant hidden in your home.
[00:26:42.855 --> 00:26:45.197]  It's the perfect emergency backup for troubled times.
[00:26:45.577 --> 00:26:48.279]  Their website is MySolarBackup.com, or give them a call.
[00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:52.302]  Get a free brochure or order a unit.
[00:26:52.322 --> 00:26:52.643]  877-327-0365.
[00:26:52.663 --> 00:26:53.724]  They have these all in stock.
[00:26:53.744 --> 00:26:54.726]  The best unit they can find.
[00:26:54.746 --> 00:26:54.806]  877-327-0365.
[00:26:54.826 --> 00:26:55.507]  Their lines are busy.
[00:26:55.547 --> 00:26:56.308]  Keep calling back.
[00:26:56.328 --> 00:26:56.368]  877-327-0365.
[00:27:08.078 --> 00:27:14.325]  Also, you know about a cola blue, ladies and gentlemen, the atmospheric water generator that is taking the country by storm.
[00:27:14.365 --> 00:27:23.734]  It grabs seven and a half gallons a day, just with their smaller unit, very affordable, out of the atmosphere and then, this doesn't just condensate, it puts it through
[00:27:24.435 --> 00:27:26.756]  Five major filters and two sub-filters.
[00:27:26.796 --> 00:27:38.723]  The water passes through an activated carbon filter, then a silver impregnated carbon filter, then a reverse osmosis system, then a taste and color odor removal filter, and is stored in an illuminated tank by antibacterial fungal UV light.
[00:27:39.284 --> 00:27:42.565]  And the machine comes in red, black, white, green, silver, and blue.
[00:27:42.625 --> 00:27:45.427]  And I have one at the office and one at my home, and we love it.
[00:27:45.467 --> 00:27:46.368]  The water is incredible.
[00:27:46.688 --> 00:27:47.708]  acolablue.com.
[00:27:47.748 --> 00:27:49.569]  Big banners up on infowars.com.
[00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:51.070]  acolablue.com or 866-585-4044.
[00:27:54.332 --> 00:28:13.506]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, going back to Alan Watt, I've been throwing a lot of questions at you, Alan, and I'm going to put up on screen again just one article, because a Bilderberg Group member, Mr. Wolf, is the editor of this, and their foreign affairs editor, Gideon Raichman, wrote the story, and now for a world government.
[00:28:14.977 --> 00:28:27.304]  I want to give you some time before we go to calls to flesh out more of, because this is key in my understanding, but I want to get your view and your nuanced understanding on this in some detail.
[00:28:27.764 --> 00:28:34.368]  Again, why now are they not just saying world government is what we need, but that they've secretly, this is all over the news,
[00:28:34.608 --> 00:28:36.489]  Building a world government for decades.
[00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:39.752]  They have an image of cave drawings.
[00:28:40.873 --> 00:28:44.135]  That's the editorial cartoon at the top of cave drawings.
[00:28:44.535 --> 00:28:50.860]  And then drawn on the wall next to images of primitive aborigines hunting deer and elk.
[00:28:52.681 --> 00:28:57.284]  And primitive bovine, they have the image of a globe or a world government.
[00:28:57.524 --> 00:29:03.848]  The message here I get is, we're the elite, we've been in control of your destiny for thousands of years, since primitive times.
[00:29:04.068 --> 00:29:07.070]  We've always wanted a world government and now we're getting one.
[00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:09.471]  The ancient dream is being realized.
[00:29:09.531 --> 00:29:14.474]  I believe this is the esoteric meaning of the editorial drawing.
[00:29:15.915 --> 00:29:17.796]  Please give us your take on this.
[00:29:19.017 --> 00:29:21.819]  Well, part of the drawing too is to do with primitive man.
[00:29:22.774 --> 00:29:25.396]  A primitive man hunting for his necessities.
[00:29:26.256 --> 00:29:32.500]  And of course, it's all to do with evolution as well, coming from the primitive, from tribal, into global society.
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:38.424]  So from differences all coming together as one under one system of domination.
[00:29:38.564 --> 00:29:41.185]  Ah, we have the wild humans being taken under the control.
[00:29:41.225 --> 00:29:41.566]  Go ahead.
[00:29:42.386 --> 00:29:48.070]  And you also have this elite themselves, who do believe in evolution.
[00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:51.592]  They believe that they are the most evolved type of humans on the planet.
[00:29:52.407 --> 00:29:58.309]  And it's been written about by Wells and the Fabian Society and many, many others down through the last hundred odd years or more.
[00:29:59.349 --> 00:30:12.934]  They believe that they have the right to rule mankind because they've proven their worth by the accumulation of vast amounts of wealth, power over the public, control over the public, and they've held on to it through generations.
[00:30:12.954 --> 00:30:16.435]  In other words, they haven't squandered it away through bad breeding, as they call it.
[00:30:16.755 --> 00:30:18.495]  They have selective breeding, especially
[00:30:21.092 --> 00:30:21.572]  We're good to go.
[00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:48.870]  I think?
[00:31:03.965 --> 00:31:04.205]  I think?
[00:31:19.269 --> 00:31:21.210]  In other words, the laws will not apply to them.
[00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:22.710]  Any kind of law will not apply.
[00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:23.591]  That's why there's so many deviants.
[00:31:23.751 --> 00:31:32.334]  We saw that in Rome, where the elite families and the Caesar could murder, kill, rape, steal, take anybody's daughter they wanted.
[00:31:32.674 --> 00:31:40.417]  They could force the lower Romans to give their daughters at age 12 into the temples, which were the prostitution centers.
[00:31:41.117 --> 00:31:48.160]  And we see the Romans training them that people being beat up and killed was entertainment, was fun, to dehumanize the public.
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:54.743]  And now we see Burger King, I did confirm what a listener told me a few days ago, with a new slogan, as if anybody else matters.
[00:31:55.223 --> 00:32:07.808]  And that speaks to the subconscious, to the id, the animal, go ahead and hurt yourself, go ahead and eat the MSG and aspartame, with a subconscious mirror of that they're really hurting the rest of the public and greedily only helping themselves.
[00:32:08.761 --> 00:32:09.241]  That's right.
[00:32:09.982 --> 00:32:15.525]  So we've had this global system running, we know, for hundreds of years.
[00:32:15.585 --> 00:32:19.007]  In reality, there never was democracy in Britain.
[00:32:19.927 --> 00:32:27.832]  Although it proclaimed it all the time, they had the democracy, they never ever had that, because the British elite watched the French Revolution very, very carefully.
[00:32:28.592 --> 00:32:31.714]  And they knew that this was a movement that was going to keep going.
[00:32:32.373 --> 00:32:38.758]  And pop up again and again, this drive for democracy, where the people wanted a say in their life and their lifestyles.
[00:32:39.478 --> 00:32:42.540]  Therefore, they decided to give the public a fake affront.
[00:32:43.681 --> 00:32:45.542]  And it's worked very, very well.
[00:32:46.023 --> 00:32:53.648]  Margaret Thatcher, in one of her speeches, said that we are part of the parallel government that's unelected by the public.
[00:32:53.688 --> 00:32:54.829]  She said she was a member.
[00:32:55.806 --> 00:33:02.851]  She was simply again reiterating what Carl Quigley said, Professor Carl Quigley, when he also mentioned this parallel government.
[00:33:03.592 --> 00:33:05.273]  So they've been at it for a long, long time.
[00:33:05.593 --> 00:33:13.359]  The idea was to unite the world and unite many different tribes and people's cultures through conflict.
[00:33:13.619 --> 00:33:16.281]  And therefore, the fastest way to do it was to create oppositions.
[00:33:16.801 --> 00:33:21.985]  They took over a good chunk of Europe and Siberia by the Soviet system.
[00:33:22.799 --> 00:33:23.660]  That's standardised.
[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:31.625]  A massive chunk of it uses the same technique in the Far East, under the guise of communism, and now they call them democratic countries.
[00:33:31.866 --> 00:33:41.533]  But what they did was standardise one system copied from the British exoteric system into their system, and you have a standardised world now.
[00:33:42.013 --> 00:33:51.600]  Now it's time to bring it all together, now that we're all the same education systems, we're taught the same nonsense in school, we're all taught the same fake facts and histories and so on.
[00:33:52.225 --> 00:33:58.489]  So now they can standardize us quite simply and easily, and the front organization for this is the United Nations.
[00:33:59.069 --> 00:34:08.834]  When you look at the foundations, and that's how the Parallel Governments operated, was the creation of foundations with masses of money to fund their NGOs.
[00:34:09.215 --> 00:34:12.156]  The Soviet system was run by NGOs.
[00:34:12.517 --> 00:34:14.518]  Their leaders were picked by the Politburo.
[00:34:14.998 --> 00:34:17.319]  We now have them picked by the Parallel Governments.
[00:34:17.379 --> 00:34:18.920]  And the US and British governments
[00:34:20.971 --> 00:34:23.712]  Allied foundations openly ran the Soviet Union.
[00:34:23.752 --> 00:34:27.993]  So if you want to know what the future is, you only need to read what the foundations are saying.
[00:34:28.013 --> 00:34:36.236]  Why don't you tell folks what the foundation's main goals are, where we are in the world system, how deep we're actually into it, and what you think we're going to see with the economy unfold.
[00:34:36.256 --> 00:34:39.337]  And we're going to go to calls in the next few years, Alan.
[00:34:40.117 --> 00:34:50.520]  Well, what they've said already is that the system they will bring in has to wean us away from our selfish need for self-preservation and accumulation of personal wealth.
[00:34:51.027 --> 00:34:52.928]  Regardless of the class you're born into.
[00:34:52.948 --> 00:35:01.714]  So that's getting rid of our instinct to become independent, take care of ourselves in the hierarchy of needs, saying it's selfish to have a self-preservation mode.
[00:35:02.534 --> 00:35:10.679]  That's what all this environmentalism that's fake is about, is to make us feel bad about being humans, so they can train us on loving our servitude, loving our feudal serfdom.
[00:35:11.279 --> 00:35:11.720]  That's right.
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:20.165]  And it's also part of the British system of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, which runs the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:35:21.465 --> 00:35:25.307]  And they have said that the world we bring in is one of servitude to the world state.
[00:35:25.627 --> 00:35:26.788]  Servitude to the world state.
[00:35:27.328 --> 00:35:30.330]  And they will decide from the top what servitude means.
[00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:36.213]  It means giving your whole life, your whole activity, your energy, your very thoughts to the world state.
[00:35:36.773 --> 00:35:38.714]  It's based on the doctrine of Plato.
[00:35:39.054 --> 00:35:40.115]  And who can have children?
[00:35:40.135 --> 00:35:40.875]  Eugenics, yes.
[00:35:41.336 --> 00:35:41.496]  Yeah.
[00:35:41.736 --> 00:35:44.637]  Plato was a member of the ancient societies.
[00:35:44.757 --> 00:35:45.858]  He studied in Egypt.
[00:35:46.451 --> 00:35:50.492]  He was initiated in Egypt, the Palestine area, and then India.
[00:35:50.792 --> 00:35:52.573]  That was the standard route he went on.
[00:35:52.893 --> 00:35:53.994]  He wrote about it himself.
[00:35:54.754 --> 00:35:57.855]  And then he said in the book called Republic, the one that H.G.
[00:35:57.895 --> 00:36:04.697]  Wells said was his Bible, Plato said, what's the problem of owning all this money and having castles?
[00:36:04.717 --> 00:36:07.198]  He says, you're afraid of being robbed by the people.
[00:36:07.618 --> 00:36:10.239]  You're afraid you have to pay all your servants, etc.
[00:36:10.539 --> 00:36:15.841]  Isn't it far better that the people under the guise that you're ruling them on their behalf,
[00:36:16.465 --> 00:36:16.785]  I think?
[00:36:35.962 --> 00:36:39.424]  And still pretend they're part of you, the same as you.
[00:36:39.705 --> 00:36:41.006]  This was the Soviet system.
[00:36:41.066 --> 00:36:50.792]  And every new crisis they create, they will always be the saviors for the next solution which is even deeper into dehumanization and degradation.
[00:36:50.832 --> 00:36:51.573]  Here's an example.
[00:36:52.173 --> 00:37:01.660]  About a year ago, I have some employees, so the Texas Workforce Commission sent me a filing in the mail and it said you now have to answer these hundreds of questions every year.
[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:04.462]  This is a North American Union survey.
[00:37:05.462 --> 00:37:13.648]  And I went on my show, I went on the web, I put it on the website, Infowars.com, and people commented that it wasn't real and it was fake.
[00:37:13.988 --> 00:37:20.953]  Now I have an image up on screen of Kroger's, and it says, product of U.S., Mexico, and Canada.
[00:37:22.334 --> 00:37:24.156]  Or product of US, Canada, and Mexico.
[00:37:24.196 --> 00:37:25.997]  So everything's converting over to this.
[00:37:26.418 --> 00:37:27.999]  As you know, they started a year and a half ago.
[00:37:28.039 --> 00:37:33.343]  It's in my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, merging the European Union and the North American Union.
[00:37:33.383 --> 00:37:37.086]  Bush goes to the Rose Garden with Merkel and Barroso, announces it.
[00:37:37.947 --> 00:37:40.849]  But then anybody that talks about it is called a kook by Rush Limbaugh.
[00:37:41.809 --> 00:37:52.376]  So how do you see this conversion happening into the next year as they parallel continue to say it doesn't exist while on the other side they say it does exist and it's happening?
[00:37:52.416 --> 00:37:57.399]  I mean how do you see the mind slaves out there who've been conditioned that this doesn't exist?
[00:37:57.699 --> 00:38:04.023]  I guess the conditioning is just meant to neutralize them long enough so they debate whether it exists or not until it's too late and already in place?
[00:38:05.356 --> 00:38:09.980]  Yes, most folk are never really in a conscious reality at any time.
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:16.745]  Most of the people who are brainwashed, and that's the majority of the public, who get their reality from television.
[00:38:17.106 --> 00:38:26.693]  Television is so surrealistic, you cannot possibly retain your sanity and your cognitive thinking abilities and reasoning powers and watch it and enjoy it at the same time.
[00:38:26.733 --> 00:38:27.454]  You can't have both.
[00:38:28.012 --> 00:38:36.837]  It's meant to put you into a strange state, where gradually, through osmosis almost, you come to accept new facts without ever consciously thinking through those facts.
[00:38:36.857 --> 00:38:42.580]  You adopt them, and you're upgraded like a computer program each time you look into it.
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:49.164]  And here's a bunch of new facts, and you'll parrot them too, and you won't even remember you had different facts that you parroted yesterday.
[00:38:49.504 --> 00:38:51.145]  That's already in society.
[00:38:51.705 --> 00:38:53.166]  That's how most folk are working today.
[00:38:53.286 --> 00:38:54.627]  And that's what Orwell talked about.
[00:38:54.867 --> 00:38:59.991]  It didn't matter if they said we're always at war with East Asia, and the next day we were never at war with East Asia.
[00:39:00.491 --> 00:39:04.414]  In Big Brother's world, they had to go back and destroy all the old newspapers and TV programs.
[00:39:04.774 --> 00:39:12.460]  Here, they just run it all parallel and say, I mean, they've skipped to the final phase where Winston's on the gurney being tortured.
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:16.022]  Then he says, do I have four fingers, two fingers, five fingers, ten fingers?
[00:39:16.483 --> 00:39:18.364]  And he says, look, just tell me how many fingers to see.
[00:39:18.424 --> 00:39:19.005]  And he said, no.
[00:39:19.625 --> 00:39:25.570]  What I want you to do is see all fingers at once and not be able to differentiate and just lay there like a jellyfish.
[00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:28.372]  And he goes, oh, now I see I love Big Brother.
[00:39:28.712 --> 00:39:31.274]  And O'Brien says, now you understand.
[00:39:31.555 --> 00:39:33.876]  We're here to tear you apart and dominate you.
[00:39:34.277 --> 00:39:36.899]  We are the priest of power, survival of the fittest.
[00:39:37.019 --> 00:39:41.683]  This is about crushing humanity and even ourselves and reducing the language down to nothing.
[00:39:41.923 --> 00:39:43.104]  And we see they've now done that.
[00:39:43.624 --> 00:39:43.924]  That's right.
[00:39:43.944 --> 00:39:44.465]  They have done it.
[00:39:44.985 --> 00:39:47.107]  There are people who are halfway waking up.
[00:39:47.996 --> 00:39:48.096]  It's
[00:40:05.859 --> 00:40:09.502]  And this again is why we're getting this predictive programming of the coming conflict.
[00:40:09.682 --> 00:40:16.368]  And O'Brien, finish in a moment, this is so key, O'Brien wants him to have that mental break into delusion, into mental illness.
[00:40:16.388 --> 00:40:17.969]  That's what the system, the schools do.
[00:40:18.209 --> 00:40:19.670]  They train you how to be insane.
[00:40:19.951 --> 00:40:22.533]  It's insane to want to drink fluoride and eat GMO food.
[00:40:22.853 --> 00:40:26.476]  It's insane to drink aspartame and MSG and excitotoxins.
[00:40:26.736 --> 00:40:31.800]  It's insane to have cancer up by three, four thousand percent and diabetes and autism.
[00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:33.902]  It's insane to be attacking innocent countries.
[00:40:34.162 --> 00:40:38.366]  And to have the White House Press Secretary say, Iraq loves us, they all love us.
[00:40:38.686 --> 00:40:43.049]  Meanwhile, they have polls over there of 90 plus percent hating what the United States does.
[00:40:43.089 --> 00:40:46.292]  But she comes to the US and says, no, they all love us.
[00:40:46.972 --> 00:40:47.373]  That's right.
[00:40:47.853 --> 00:40:55.199]  The official version is, you see, we're living under what's becoming open authoritarianism.
[00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:58.202]  It truly is the Orwellian system.
[00:40:58.922 --> 00:41:03.626]  And yet it's only to be for part of a phase, the 30 year phase, and then in comes the Huxleyan
[00:41:04.124 --> 00:41:07.405]  And this is a 30-year hot war against humanity, then it goes into the THX 1138 lobotomized suboid population.
[00:41:29.767 --> 00:41:35.309]  And the Army's War College's own figures and the studies they do, you have to really look at their studies.
[00:41:35.349 --> 00:41:37.030]  They use history to the maximum.
[00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:38.850]  That's why they chose 30 years.
[00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:40.451]  They studied the 30 years war.
[00:41:40.531 --> 00:41:50.535]  And they say, we've got the American people, we've enslaved them, and that's what's so horrifying is to read all this, to show the viewers this, to know they're cold-bloodedly doing this.
[00:41:50.555 --> 00:41:51.735]  This is not our military.
[00:41:51.915 --> 00:41:52.936]  This is not our government.
[00:41:53.236 --> 00:41:54.476]  I mean, what is this we're facing?
[00:41:54.516 --> 00:41:56.157]  What is this scientific technocracy?
[00:41:56.775 --> 00:41:56.975]  Yes.
[00:41:57.275 --> 00:42:09.879]  Well, as I say, the Military College has already done a big bunch of articles up on projected population declines in the West, because they've been following it for 50 years since they've been sterilizing the Western males.
[00:42:10.799 --> 00:42:16.001]  And they know in 30 years' time we'll all be dead with cancers and so on, and infertile anyway.
[00:42:16.981 --> 00:42:22.103]  So they've said themselves that many of the European countries are past the point
[00:42:22.893 --> 00:42:27.157]  Of repopulation, of coming back again in the same number as they were before.
[00:42:27.257 --> 00:42:28.038]  And they crow this.
[00:42:28.078 --> 00:42:29.459]  They brag on NPR.
[00:42:29.719 --> 00:42:31.621]  Isn't it great the evil West is dying?
[00:42:31.701 --> 00:42:32.562]  Isn't it wonderful?
[00:42:32.982 --> 00:42:34.364]  Oh, I mean, these are the sickest.
[00:42:34.784 --> 00:42:36.646]  This is nihilistic self-suicide.
[00:42:37.206 --> 00:42:40.129]  Yeah, I tell you, Hitler was a boy scout compared to these boys.
[00:42:40.149 --> 00:42:41.510]  All right, we come back.
[00:42:41.530 --> 00:42:42.531]  I want to go to calls the next hour.
[00:42:42.571 --> 00:42:43.272]  We come back, though.
[00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:57.026]  I want to talk about the minions, the technocrats that have a piece of the pyramidal structure, who know it's eugenics, but who have this fake environmental idea that humans are bad and it's a great thing to kill off the parasites.
[00:42:57.487 --> 00:43:01.989]  Don't they understand that it's they themselves and their families that are also going to be wiped out?
[00:43:03.723 --> 00:43:06.765]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:43:07.226 --> 00:43:10.508]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:43:10.989 --> 00:43:16.933]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[00:43:17.294 --> 00:43:21.457]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[00:43:21.937 --> 00:43:27.662]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[00:43:27.962 --> 00:43:31.024]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:43:31.365 --> 00:43:33.166]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios,
[00:43:33.555 --> 00:43:33.780]  Come on.
[00:43:34.258 --> 00:43:34.878]  We're good to go!
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:10.105]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:44:10.486 --> 00:44:12.467]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:44:13.128 --> 00:44:14.148]  But who is the enemy?
[00:44:14.669 --> 00:44:15.189]  Bin Laden.
[00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:16.410]  This is his ammo.
[00:44:16.450 --> 00:44:17.771]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:44:17.811 --> 00:44:19.493]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:44:19.833 --> 00:44:26.578]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:44:26.979 --> 00:44:27.419]  Some U.S.
[00:44:27.459 --> 00:44:33.124]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:44:33.804 --> 00:44:37.287]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:44:37.307 --> 00:44:40.110]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:45:04.019 --> 00:45:05.860]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.182]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:45:11.363 --> 00:45:12.683]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:45:12.963 --> 00:45:21.127]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:45:21.367 --> 00:45:27.090]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:29.052]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:45:29.092 --> 00:45:31.255]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:45:31.275 --> 00:45:35.660]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:45:35.821 --> 00:45:37.963]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:45:38.043 --> 00:45:45.833]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[00:46:14.111 --> 00:46:22.138]  There's a man going around taking names and he decides who to free and who to blame.
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:27.282]  Everybody won't be treated all the same.
[00:46:29.144 --> 00:46:37.291]  There'll be a golden ladder reaching down when the man comes around.
[00:46:42.637 --> 00:46:59.072]  Bottom line, this is a bunch of globalist control freaks playing God, taking control of our genetics, the planet's genetics, taking control of our water, our food, one-child policies, controlled plagues, all of it.
[00:46:59.212 --> 00:47:07.540]  Alan, getting back into the question I asked you about the minions of this system, they're trained that their identity is being members of the elite,
[00:47:08.413 --> 00:47:13.516]  But 99% of them are not true members of the elite, and they're going against their very human code.
[00:47:13.536 --> 00:47:17.699]  Can you speak to their programming and ways to break that or ways to defeat this?
[00:47:17.819 --> 00:47:18.339]  Alan, what?
[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:23.062]  Well, they are the bureaucratic types that Orwell shows.
[00:47:23.662 --> 00:47:27.725]  The movie that was done in Britain with Richard Burton and John Hurt were excellent, really.
[00:47:28.185 --> 00:47:31.487]  They showed you this bureaucratic elite that controls the masses.
[00:47:31.507 --> 00:47:33.068]  They kept saying the masses don't count.
[00:47:33.088 --> 00:47:34.049]  They call them the proles.
[00:47:34.489 --> 00:47:35.990]  They kept saying the proles don't count.
[00:47:36.010 --> 00:47:37.551]  In other words, they would take whatever they were given.
[00:47:38.707 --> 00:47:52.810]  The main thrust of propaganda and indoctrination was actually done on the bureaucratic class themselves, who had to adapt to the new paradigms that were given to them every other week, and really believe it themselves.
[00:47:53.350 --> 00:47:56.151]  And of course, the Winston character was one of those bureaucrats.
[00:47:56.191 --> 00:48:02.972]  He broke free of it himself, or else his indoctrination didn't take quite properly, and he was being observed.
[00:48:04.036 --> 00:48:10.081]  I've talked to quite a few bureaucrats and they are in a strange state between reality.
[00:48:10.121 --> 00:48:11.061]  They know what's going on.
[00:48:11.081 --> 00:48:12.943]  They're quite aware of it.
[00:48:13.403 --> 00:48:15.425]  They also have this battle of self-interest.
[00:48:15.465 --> 00:48:17.006]  They do love the lifestyle they're given.
[00:48:17.026 --> 00:48:18.047]  They're very well paid.
[00:48:18.067 --> 00:48:22.070]  They've been mixed with their own kind all the time.
[00:48:22.908 --> 00:48:24.829]  They read the books they're advised to read.
[00:48:24.869 --> 00:48:38.674]  There's lots of books put out there by intellectuals that are designed to work on the bureaucratic class, to re-bolster their present belief systems as being superior, and yet they themselves are also afraid that they'll fall from grace.
[00:48:38.714 --> 00:48:50.878]  That's the worst thing that could happen to one of these lifelong bureaucrats, especially the hereditary ones, is falling from grace and falling down amongst the cesspools, they say, of the masses, sun-washed masses,
[00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:57.555]  So, they do know that their time is numbered, too, because eventually there'll be no more use for them.
[00:48:57.615 --> 00:49:06.042]  However, each one who is alive today will believe they'll live their life in a fair, good standard of luxury while the system goes down.
[00:49:06.383 --> 00:49:11.247]  They don't care very much about those that come after them, as long as they're okay.
[00:49:11.267 --> 00:49:15.050]  So self-interest plays a big, big part in all of this.
[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:22.443]  I've got the Phoenix Business Journal today on the heels of us yesterday writing a story about this.
[00:49:22.563 --> 00:49:24.164]  Arizona police say they're prepared.
[00:49:24.985 --> 00:49:28.287]  As War College warns, military must prep for unrest.
[00:49:28.427 --> 00:49:31.069]  IMF warns of economic crises and riots.
[00:49:31.810 --> 00:49:38.254]  And we meanwhile have all these presidents and prime ministers coming out saying we're now going to have a depression.
[00:49:39.275 --> 00:49:44.118]  So while they were getting their own money prepared and safe, they were telling the public everything was fine.
[00:49:44.178 --> 00:49:47.160]  Now they're coming in trying to destroy confidence
[00:49:48.201 --> 00:49:49.242]  This is just incredible.
[00:49:51.985 --> 00:50:06.182]  What's even more so is the fact that when you look through the Army War College's own predictions from their think tanks, they say that there will be, during this time of rioting and conflict across the globe, during the 30 years,
[00:50:07.546 --> 00:50:19.257]  There will be safe havens for the elite and the high-level bureaucrats themselves in certain parts of the world which will live at a very high standard of luxury compared to the rest of the planet.
[00:50:20.967 --> 00:50:23.448]  That's what they're building in the Middle East right now, too.
[00:50:23.468 --> 00:50:24.188]  That's one of them.
[00:50:24.449 --> 00:50:26.269]  Yeah, Dubai and other areas.
[00:50:27.090 --> 00:50:27.750]  Stay there, Alan.
[00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:29.731]  We're going to take calls coming up in the next hour.
[00:50:30.451 --> 00:50:37.254]  But then at the bottom of the hour, I'm just going to give you the floor because you bring up so many things, so many points where I want to jump in.
[00:50:37.274 --> 00:50:41.376]  I'm going to give you the floor so you can go into any areas you think are most important.
[00:50:41.616 --> 00:50:42.077]  Stay with us.

[00:50:53.922 --> 00:51:06.652]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:51:07.072 --> 00:51:10.895]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[00:51:11.235 --> 00:51:17.740]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:21.302]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.

[00:51:56.352 --> 00:51:58.274]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:58.734 --> 00:52:01.497]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:19.585 --> 00:52:23.388]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen, into the fourth and final hour today.
[00:52:23.448 --> 00:52:24.668]  Our guest is Alan Watt.
[00:52:25.589 --> 00:52:31.953]  For anyone that doubts that the New World Order is social engineers, we do horrible things in society.
[00:52:33.752 --> 00:52:37.577]  They publicly funded the Maoist, now declassified.
[00:52:37.597 --> 00:52:42.683]  All the old-timers in the military came back and told us that in 1949 the U.S.
[00:52:42.703 --> 00:52:47.328]  government put them into power and then funded them to kill at least 60 million people.
[00:52:48.129 --> 00:52:49.150]  That's a conservative number.
[00:52:49.391 --> 00:52:51.153]  Some estimates are as high as 86 million.
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:55.643]  The big New York and London banks funded the Bolsheviks in 1917.
[00:52:56.164 --> 00:52:57.785]  Declassified on record.
[00:52:58.186 --> 00:52:58.886]  Mainline history.
[00:52:59.146 --> 00:53:00.107]  It's not on the nightly news.
[00:53:00.708 --> 00:53:02.410]  They funded Hitler, the Milner Group.
[00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:03.351]  They put them into power.
[00:53:03.691 --> 00:53:04.472]  They set them up.
[00:53:05.441 --> 00:53:14.128]  And so if you think they won't bring in a worldwide depression so they can openly set up world government, foreign by the banks, where you buy your carbon credits directly from them, you've got another thing coming.
[00:53:14.628 --> 00:53:17.711]  All those years we told you they would do just that, now they're announcing it and doing it.
[00:53:18.271 --> 00:53:20.152]  We don't deserve any accolades here, folks.
[00:53:20.212 --> 00:53:21.413]  We just weren't under mind control.
[00:53:21.814 --> 00:53:29.520]  We could read what the Club of Rome and IMF and World Bank and Council on Foreign Relations and Trilateral Commission were saying and doing in their own policy reports.
[00:53:30.776 --> 00:53:33.197]  We're going to come back in the next segment and go to all the callers.
[00:53:33.897 --> 00:53:37.879]  Matt, Chris, Ben, Brian, Tim, and many others that are patiently holding.
[00:53:37.899 --> 00:53:43.422]  But in this short segment, Alan Watt, we've talked about the mindset of the outer party.
[00:53:43.442 --> 00:53:46.603]  You have the proles, the outer party, and the inner party in the pyramidal structure.
[00:53:46.623 --> 00:53:51.365]  The inner party at the top, the outer party in the elite, who are some of the most oppressed and surveilled.
[00:53:51.626 --> 00:53:58.489]  The NSA is really there to spy on them, control them, burn a few of their minions to keep them all in line, selectively enforcing laws.
[00:53:59.289 --> 00:54:07.857]  Let's talk about some of the lower-level minions, the police, the military, those that have been slowly twisted to accept all of this.
[00:54:08.157 --> 00:54:10.859]  What do they have to look forward to going along with this system?
[00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:22.490]  Well, what we have is really what's already happened over many years, and we've had a generation who've grown up very often in single-parent families, no fathers.
[00:54:22.990 --> 00:54:23.791]  Their choices were
[00:54:24.508 --> 00:54:29.212]  So they changed the male archetype to a thug with an ugly look on his face, all the toys now, who's a U.N.
[00:54:29.252 --> 00:54:37.598]  soldier who beats people's brains in with no due process, and so the males then, like a baby duck imprinting, they imprint on that through Cobra Commander.
[00:54:53.937 --> 00:54:55.038]  There's no doubt at all.
[00:54:55.419 --> 00:55:09.993]  And they have raised a generation worldwide to have this image of the black uniform, the power, the big machine gun, and booting around these little people that don't even seem to be human to these people in uniform.
[00:55:10.593 --> 00:55:16.219]  You see, the indoctrination, the scientific indoctrination of the military is very, very precise.
[00:55:16.539 --> 00:55:22.503]  And they know that males want to be warriors, so they say your dad, your grandpa, your grandma, they can't teach you how to shoot.
[00:55:23.023 --> 00:55:24.024]  You can't be armed.
[00:55:24.084 --> 00:55:25.325]  Civilians can't be armed.
[00:55:25.365 --> 00:55:26.686]  That gun culture is bad.
[00:55:27.006 --> 00:55:31.509]  But then if you go join the dark side, then you're allowed to carry out these male activities.
[00:55:32.169 --> 00:55:37.733]  You have that, but you also have the tribalism is allowed to basically progress.
[00:55:38.273 --> 00:55:40.955]  You see, in society, they've stopped basic tribalism.
[00:55:41.716 --> 00:55:44.719]  It's been condemned and condemned until it's a taboo.
[00:55:44.819 --> 00:55:47.661]  And then created false systems within their control.
[00:55:48.101 --> 00:55:48.542]  That's right.
[00:55:48.602 --> 00:55:52.905]  So you can join this fraternity, this brotherhood, and suddenly you're one of the gang.
[00:55:53.646 --> 00:55:54.826]  They'll fight and die for you.
[00:55:54.867 --> 00:55:56.007]  You'll lie for each other.
[00:55:56.027 --> 00:55:57.889]  The cops have been doing that forever.
[00:55:57.909 --> 00:56:02.392]  And so that's the whole paradigm there.
[00:56:02.753 --> 00:56:04.214]  And they're well paid.
[00:56:05.253 --> 00:56:09.657]  They can also have little goodies and little things that the general public can't get access to.
[00:56:09.677 --> 00:56:10.678]  Special status?
[00:56:11.438 --> 00:56:11.618]  Yes.
[00:56:11.779 --> 00:56:21.706]  Take California, where upwards of a million people can't get tickets, can't get DWIs, can't get red light cameras, because their license number is encoded in the computer as above the law.
[00:56:22.547 --> 00:56:23.107]  That's correct.
[00:56:23.668 --> 00:56:30.073]  And so you do have a militarized youth, they've grown up with the games, they've been desensitized to killing.
[00:56:30.737 --> 00:56:35.440]  Because that's what games are all about, getting from the beginning to the end and killing as much as possible.
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:39.863]  So that's what it is to be a man to these characters.
[00:56:40.345 --> 00:56:42.106]  They see the public really as it.
[00:56:42.266 --> 00:56:43.928]  They don't see them as people anymore.
[00:56:44.648 --> 00:56:47.070]  Powerless, it's... It's an us against them.
[00:56:47.130 --> 00:56:58.178]  They teach them we're civilian scum, they're the god-like creatures that are doing all these bad things for their own safety and their brotherhood, but the brotherhood really is there to flush them down the toilet, and the bankers are about to take their pension funds as well.
[00:56:58.578 --> 00:56:59.459]  Alan Watts, stay there.
[00:56:59.539 --> 00:57:03.482]  Phone calls straight ahead, right here on GCN and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:57:04.763 --> 00:57:06.444]  Hello, I'm Steve Shane.
[00:57:07.079 --> 00:57:10.101]  We're entering a holiday season never before seen in America.
[00:57:10.541 --> 00:57:18.947]  We're thankful for the warning given by members of Mr. Obama's campaign team of the coming international incident, which will force unpopular decisions.
[00:57:19.367 --> 00:57:29.333]  Without this warning, many of us who still have money available would have unknowingly wasted it on Christmas gifts that will be useless when the only food available is in a government breadline.
[00:57:29.553 --> 00:57:32.255]  When the President is faced with the expected national
[00:57:34.804 --> 00:57:35.044]  I think so.
[00:58:03.635 --> 00:58:10.019]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:58:10.399 --> 00:58:12.380]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:58:13.041 --> 00:58:14.081]  But who is the enemy?
[00:58:14.582 --> 00:58:15.102]  Bin Laden.
[00:58:15.402 --> 00:58:16.203]  This is his ammo.
[00:58:16.243 --> 00:58:17.684]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:58:17.724 --> 00:58:19.405]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:58:19.745 --> 00:58:26.509]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:58:26.909 --> 00:58:27.349]  Some U.S.
[00:58:27.389 --> 00:58:33.033]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:58:33.733 --> 00:58:37.175]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:58:37.195 --> 00:58:39.377]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:59:04.315 --> 00:59:16.012]  Now that the election is over and the shock is beginning to wear off, Ready Reserve Foods in an effort to get as many Americans prepared for the promised changes of the new administration and to help you and your family survive the global economic crash.
[00:59:17.739 --> 00:59:17.979]  I think so.
[00:59:49.838 --> 00:59:50.459]  We're good to go.
[01:00:14.025 --> 01:00:17.207]  We are back live with Alan Watt, our guest.
[01:00:17.267 --> 01:00:19.067]  I want to go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[01:00:19.988 --> 01:00:22.369]  First up is Matt in Iowa.
[01:00:22.429 --> 01:00:23.470]  Matt, thank you for holding.
[01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:25.130]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:00:25.451 --> 01:00:25.871]  Go ahead.
[01:00:27.131 --> 01:00:28.512]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:00:29.353 --> 01:00:42.519]  I just wanted to pass along to you, I don't know if you'd seen, you were talking about cops and other shows that kind of accustom people to presence of armed public servants, quote unquote.
[01:00:43.192 --> 01:00:50.995]  I don't know, but I was watching ABC and this new show Homeland Security USA is going to be on.
[01:00:51.295 --> 01:00:56.197]  Yeah, they're showing us who our new bosses are and how we're going to have national police with the military.
[01:00:56.477 --> 01:01:02.539]  And again, everybody they go after is always guilty in these made-for-TV shows and dramas and in real-life shows.
[01:01:02.759 --> 01:01:08.822]  There's a whole bunch of new Homeland Security shows and it's come out the federal government is funding and financing, but not just here.
[01:01:08.882 --> 01:01:11.663]  Governments worldwide are producing similar shows.
[01:01:11.683 --> 01:01:12.023]  Go ahead.
[01:01:13.562 --> 01:01:25.786]  The other thing I wanted to talk about, too, was I was Christmas shopping the other day, and there were these younger kids hanging out in the mall distributing Go Green bags, which is whatever, that's fine, giving out bags to reuse again.
[01:01:26.866 --> 01:01:37.790]  But on the side of it, it said Go Green underneath it was Midwest One Bank, and the O in the Go Green was scarily similar to the O of Obama's
[01:01:39.727 --> 01:01:42.328]  Yeah, this whole system is guaranteed to be run under the guise of greening
[01:02:07.173 --> 01:02:13.534]  The Green Party was set up to actually kick off that whole agenda, and that will be the big stick.
[01:02:13.554 --> 01:02:16.755]  It's to do with depopulation as part of it.
[01:02:16.775 --> 01:02:17.575]  They keep hammering.
[01:02:17.595 --> 01:02:18.595]  There's too many of us.
[01:02:19.635 --> 01:02:23.776]  We can't go on with unrestricted consumption, sustainability.
[01:02:23.816 --> 01:02:28.137]  It's in every single speech they're making from every quarter, from every country.
[01:02:28.597 --> 01:02:34.558]  And so that's being hammered into the general population that we are responsible for the terrible state of the world.
[01:02:35.242 --> 01:02:35.843]  Thank you.
[01:02:51.826 --> 01:02:52.346]  Now, to be clear,
[01:03:13.365 --> 01:03:18.410]  You've said this, I've said this, we're only reading government documents, what they've been quietly planning, now they're unveiling it.
[01:03:19.071 --> 01:03:29.883]  The private banks come in, issue all this liquidity, infect all the stocks, the bonds, the mutual funds, the 401Ks, the pensions, the government pensions, fire, police, teachers.
[01:03:30.663 --> 01:03:31.785]  They set all this up.
[01:03:32.847 --> 01:03:51.834]  Then they implode the economy, they come in as the savior and they say the new model is you'll pay your taxes directly to the IMF and World Bank and now suddenly the last few years you don't fill out your income tax to the exchequer, you don't fill out your income tax in the United States to the IRS, now it's to the Federal Reserve, it's now to the private
[01:03:52.694 --> 01:04:02.759]  Bank of England, and then last week in the New York Times and a bunch of other publications, all on the same day, simultaneously, they announced, well, we're going to go ahead and probably bankrupt U.S.
[01:04:04.079 --> 01:04:05.080]  T-bills and bonds.
[01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:07.021]  You know, we're blowing that out worldwide.
[01:04:07.301 --> 01:04:14.784]  You'll now buy your securities that have, quote, government backing by taxpayers, directly from the private Federal Reserve.
[01:04:14.824 --> 01:04:17.386]  So your World ID card with your credits on it
[01:04:18.166 --> 01:04:24.851]  And people are trying to buy cash, headlights, batteries, toothpaste, everywhere they're demanding now, even with a $5 purchase.
[01:04:25.351 --> 01:04:26.752]  Hey, you've got to give me your name and number.
[01:04:27.193 --> 01:04:31.936]  And that is to get you ready for the cashless society and to destroy the underground economy.
[01:04:32.136 --> 01:04:35.218]  Because they'll say, wait a minute, you've bought more than what your paycheck says.
[01:04:35.579 --> 01:04:37.320]  You must be doing underground barter.
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:40.222]  And that's why they want to tax the web, and they're now announcing that.
[01:04:40.502 --> 01:04:42.223]  So it's all coming into fruition.
[01:04:42.283 --> 01:04:45.465]  And I just posted up on the screen the Curt Nimmo article.
[01:04:45.525 --> 01:04:48.968]  Democrats determined to reimpose fairness doctrine.
[01:04:48.988 --> 01:04:50.048]  Look at that Orwellian term.
[01:04:50.088 --> 01:04:53.831]  It's like the Patriot Act or the New Freedom Initiative, all taking your freedom.
[01:04:54.151 --> 01:04:58.194]  The Daily Post in Palo Alto is reporting what Congress is saying.
[01:04:58.234 --> 01:05:02.977]  They do intend to restrict free speech on internet radio, AM and FM, everything.
[01:05:03.237 --> 01:05:06.900]  The FCC announcing they will control, quote, speech on the internet.
[01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:07.400]  Alan, what?
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:08.521]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:05:08.541 --> 01:05:19.109]  And even Google and all the big boys have come out with their main servers saying they're now going to see who will be pushed on the web and all the different search engines and who they will restrict.
[01:05:19.649 --> 01:05:21.951]  So this is the censorship already here.
[01:05:22.171 --> 01:05:23.592]  But you're right to do with purchasing.
[01:05:24.152 --> 01:05:31.398]  Ten years ago in Canada and most countries across Europe too, suddenly if you bought tires for your car, they would want your full name and address and so on.
[01:05:32.172 --> 01:05:33.552]  Now they want to know your vehicle.
[01:05:34.012 --> 01:05:36.873]  And I asked a guy in the store, he says, yeah, it's actually the law.
[01:05:36.913 --> 01:05:38.253]  He showed me on the computer.
[01:05:38.513 --> 01:05:44.434]  It is the law that they must find out what car you have, this registration number and everything, before you can buy tires.
[01:05:46.354 --> 01:05:46.815]  Amazing.
[01:05:46.875 --> 01:05:49.595]  Again, punch up on screen, guys, this article that I put up here.
[01:05:50.175 --> 01:05:52.776]  Democrats determined to reimpose Fairness Doctrine.
[01:05:53.816 --> 01:05:56.296]  Going back to the caller, did you have anything else you wanted to add, sir?
[01:05:56.676 --> 01:06:01.097]  Yeah, I was wondering if you guys think that home insecurity or
[01:06:01.579 --> 01:06:01.659]  It's
[01:06:15.472 --> 01:06:20.993]  Well, yes, we're having the same fascistic, you know, basic symbols, basic tribalism.
[01:06:21.273 --> 01:06:27.615]  They're bringing us into the crisis, and the message is in the media, Obama is your savior, just put your trust in him.
[01:06:27.975 --> 01:06:34.916]  When he was the biggest cheerleader for the banker takeover, but then I hear the Democrats saying, no, he will save us from the evil bankers.
[01:06:35.176 --> 01:06:35.636]  Alan Watt?
[01:06:36.477 --> 01:06:41.818]  Yeah, it is true, too, and his speech at the end of the election, he wore the red and
[01:06:43.243 --> 01:06:44.303]  White and black tie.
[01:06:44.343 --> 01:06:45.644]  His wife wore red and black.
[01:06:46.104 --> 01:06:48.944]  And that's the colors of Nazi fascism.
[01:06:49.064 --> 01:06:49.565]  Socialism.
[01:06:50.185 --> 01:06:52.585]  But it can't be Nazism because he's a black guy.
[01:06:53.005 --> 01:06:55.566]  No, it's the corporate fascist model.
[01:06:55.866 --> 01:06:57.727]  It's the corporate fascist model.
[01:06:57.987 --> 01:06:59.467]  And it can come in Idi Amin.
[01:06:59.507 --> 01:07:00.607]  It can come under Hitler.
[01:07:01.187 --> 01:07:01.648]  Go ahead, Alan.
[01:07:01.668 --> 01:07:02.288]  You're making a point.
[01:07:02.768 --> 01:07:06.589]  Yeah, they'd love to show you their agenda right in your face, knowing it.
[01:07:06.609 --> 01:07:09.790]  Like the Masons say, we never speak so openly as when we do in public.
[01:07:09.810 --> 01:07:11.510]  The public never understands what they're really hearing.
[01:07:12.290 --> 01:07:18.472]  Uh, or seeing either, but they do show you that in symbols and colors, this is all Pythagorean, the color coding and so on.
[01:07:19.073 --> 01:07:34.979]  It goes back for thousands of years, but they do go along with this, and you have to go into Obama's mother to find out why she was raised, what she was trained for, and you'll find that she was trained to be a world revolutionary, and actually to literally breed an offspring to be the president one day.
[01:07:35.453 --> 01:07:37.174]  All right, Matt, thank you for the call.
[01:07:37.934 --> 01:07:40.956]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Arizona.
[01:07:41.436 --> 01:07:42.737]  Chris, go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:07:42.757 --> 01:07:43.677]  Hello?
[01:07:44.197 --> 01:07:44.458]  Yes.
[01:07:45.318 --> 01:07:49.460]  Yes, Alex, I've been listening for about, oh, since 2005.
[01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:59.665]  I was over in Kuwait for a year, and one of my friends, he's an Iraq vet, you know, and he woke me up to this stuff.
[01:07:59.705 --> 01:08:04.968]  I didn't want to believe it at first, but, you know, I've been listening to your radio show, and I got a lot of your videos.
[01:08:05.956 --> 01:08:11.279]  They really woke me up, and I just want to thank you for that, first of all.
[01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:13.701]  Well, don't thank me, sir.
[01:08:14.241 --> 01:08:28.510]  My family, myself, your family, Alan, none of us have any future if these social engineers, these madmen, these control freaks, these hyper-dominant people that want to literally kill us, an engineer who's left,
[01:08:29.431 --> 01:08:31.673]  You know, either they're defeated or we're destroyed.
[01:08:32.033 --> 01:08:33.154]  And so, don't thank me.
[01:08:33.314 --> 01:08:34.395]  Thank God you woke up.
[01:08:34.455 --> 01:08:38.799]  Thank God something in your background let you break your conditioning and the false paradigm you were in.
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:42.542]  So understand, people always thank me for what I'm doing, or thank Alan, or thank others.
[01:08:43.163 --> 01:08:50.209]  Listen, we are only doing what a normal person historically would do when faced with this type of attack.
[01:08:50.249 --> 01:08:56.414]  I mean, when The Globalist openly announced they're waging war against humanity, all I can do is fight back against them.
[01:08:56.715 --> 01:08:56.915]  Alan?
[01:08:57.543 --> 01:08:58.964]  We have no choice in the matter.
[01:08:59.364 --> 01:09:01.906]  If you truly understand what's happening, you have no choice.
[01:09:02.287 --> 01:09:03.828]  You cannot sit with the knowledge.
[01:09:04.548 --> 01:09:05.629]  It'll kill you, otherwise.
[01:09:05.649 --> 01:09:06.790]  You have to get it out there.
[01:09:08.331 --> 01:09:08.912]  Absolutely.
[01:09:08.932 --> 01:09:12.995]  Anything else, sir?
[01:09:13.015 --> 01:09:20.120]  One of my friends I work with, he just bought a firearm, and it was one of those big Desert Eagle 50s, you know?
[01:09:21.161 --> 01:09:26.305]  And he told me about next year, the 2009 models are going to have GPS's in them.
[01:09:26.863 --> 01:09:27.123]  Yes.
[01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:29.745]  Everything is RFID in the guns.
[01:09:29.825 --> 01:09:33.947]  Everything is under Schwarzenegger marking the shell casing.
[01:09:34.187 --> 01:09:37.009]  That will then force adoption of that nationwide and worldwide.
[01:09:37.789 --> 01:09:38.770]  It's all happening.
[01:09:38.790 --> 01:09:42.672]  They're coming for the guns and people think that's just some archetypal thing I say.
[01:09:43.232 --> 01:09:59.711]  The troops are openly been training for decades to door-to-door shut off the food and water and then 99% of people on average they believe I don't believe that's accurate more like 90% will turn their guns in then they'll go after the rest of the people they know who's got guns it is registration when you fill out the yellow form
[01:10:00.091 --> 01:10:05.013]  It's long gun, shotgun, or handgun, and it's now being prepared.
[01:10:05.033 --> 01:10:11.956]  The good news is, though, Alan, and I appreciate your call, sir, the good news is that people have bought the gun stores bare.
[01:10:11.996 --> 01:10:13.577]  The ammo has basically been sold out.
[01:10:14.037 --> 01:10:15.098]  Record gun purchases.
[01:10:15.118 --> 01:10:15.858]  That shows.
[01:10:15.878 --> 01:10:19.780]  And then Obama comes out and says, don't worry, I only want to ban some of your guns and restrict some of them.
[01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:21.280]  Stop buying guns.
[01:10:21.581 --> 01:10:26.743]  And the BATF is now harassing gun dealers and trying to get on the local news, telling people don't buy guns.
[01:10:27.003 --> 01:10:29.064]  So it doesn't seem like things are working for them, Alan.
[01:10:30.334 --> 01:10:32.195]  Yeah, they do expect trouble.
[01:10:32.315 --> 01:10:33.755]  They do expect the problems.
[01:10:34.455 --> 01:10:44.379]  What they're hoping for is, and I don't think they're even hoping for it, they've got it set up already that this rapid reaction force will be pulled in from other countries to deal.
[01:10:44.599 --> 01:10:52.161]  They know that there's going to be a problem down the road if their own people, if your own American soldiers start killing Americans.
[01:10:52.762 --> 01:10:59.384]  Eventually they get to a stage, and they found this in Nazi Germany with the firing squads, they get to a stage where the guys who were killing
[01:10:59.844 --> 01:11:00.325]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:11:16.641 --> 01:11:21.347]  Well, they did that in Poland.
[01:11:21.367 --> 01:11:24.131]  They'd bring people from the East to the West and the North to the South.
[01:11:24.371 --> 01:11:31.561]  And for those that don't know, when we come back I'm going to briefly list all the mainstream news, the Pentagon, the British, major war college reports.
[01:11:32.402 --> 01:11:38.624]  The biggest army recruiting centers and marine centers are in Mexico, they're in the Eastern Europe, they're in the Philippines.
[01:11:39.004 --> 01:11:41.385]  So already in our military is a bunch of foreigners.
[01:11:41.405 --> 01:11:45.626]  They're also hiring violent felons, foreigners who are aggravated felons for the military.
[01:11:45.966 --> 01:11:48.887]  That's Washington Times, Washington Post, both telling you how great it is.
[01:11:49.608 --> 01:11:52.789]  They've also signed a deal to use Canadian and Mexican troops in the United States.
[01:11:53.029 --> 01:11:55.049]  That's been in the Toronto Star and other publications.
[01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:59.811]  Congress said, hey, we weren't consulted earlier this year, and they were told shut up by NORTHCOM.
[01:12:00.151 --> 01:12:03.814]  So they do have foreign troops ready to come, take your guns, and rape and kill you.
[01:12:03.834 --> 01:12:05.636]  Do you have everybody's attention please?
[01:12:05.756 --> 01:12:08.158]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:12:08.178 --> 01:12:10.299]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:12:10.419 --> 01:12:11.981]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:12:12.001 --> 01:12:13.642]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:12:13.722 --> 01:12:20.247]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage, was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:12:29.913 --> 01:12:34.800]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:12:36.042 --> 01:12:37.143]  An inside job.
[01:12:38.550 --> 01:12:39.650]  How dare you?
[01:12:40.991 --> 01:12:46.052]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:12:46.072 --> 01:12:48.473]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:12:48.533 --> 01:12:55.155]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[01:12:55.175 --> 01:12:57.996]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[01:12:58.276 --> 01:13:00.256]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:13:00.536 --> 01:13:02.997]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:13:03.737 --> 01:13:07.640]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:13:07.861 --> 01:13:20.131]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:13:20.571 --> 01:13:20.972]  The U.S.
[01:13:21.012 --> 01:13:26.597]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:13:26.997 --> 01:13:29.199]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:13:31.044 --> 01:13:32.104]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[01:13:32.144 --> 01:13:35.005]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[01:13:35.125 --> 01:13:41.127]  However, shocking the economy with a reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.

[01:14:03.524 --> 01:14:06.825]  The United States is bankrupt and the bankers want you bankrupt also.

[01:16:07.014 --> 01:16:11.976]  I've played this quite a few times, but the next segment I'm going to play and get Alan Watts' take on it.
[01:16:12.376 --> 01:16:16.197]  There's a bunch of video games out in the last decade, like Shattered Union.
[01:16:17.858 --> 01:16:23.960]  And in some of these games, your job, you work for the Illuminati, for the world government, you hunt down and kill militias.
[01:16:25.182 --> 01:16:26.784]  You torture militia members to death.
[01:16:27.745 --> 01:16:38.899]  In one game, when you get to the final level, you get into a safe at the top of the Illuminati and one of my videos, Police State 2000, is the great secret inside of the safe.
[01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:42.944]  I don't know why the establishment does that or why they keep sticking my voice.
[01:16:45.629 --> 01:16:45.749]  Hi!
[01:16:46.210 --> 01:16:46.850]  How are you?
[01:16:47.090 --> 01:16:48.692]  I'd like to thank you, Alex.
[01:16:48.872 --> 01:16:50.033]  I know what you said before, but
[01:17:11.084 --> 01:17:20.909]  Even though I was aware like a deer that knew it was hunting season, it wasn't until you led me in the right direction in 2005 that I started to make some sense of my life.
[01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:35.296]  Today I was calling you, I did want to talk about my Prime Minister puppet and cell phones and things like that, but I noticed that there's a lie being propounded out there and there's a chance that even our side of truthers might buy into that lie.
[01:17:35.977 --> 01:17:40.759]  And that lie would be that this is the first time that there's a one world power.
[01:17:41.525 --> 01:17:53.475]  I'm getting kind of tired of reminding people and asking them if they've ever heard of a little place called Babel, and a little guy called Nimrod, because that was actually the first global world power.
[01:17:54.175 --> 01:17:56.217]  And at that time, he had one language.
[01:17:56.838 --> 01:18:02.162]  He probably had everybody compartmentalize the way they do it now, too, but there was only one language.
[01:18:02.442 --> 01:18:04.684]  And when God came down and messed him up, well,
[01:18:05.242 --> 01:18:08.684]  All the different languages went off with all their little pieces of what to do.
[01:18:08.924 --> 01:18:18.209]  Yeah, that story is of the system breaking apart, that global empire, and then the Romans, and then the Roman Catholic Church, and the British Empire.
[01:18:18.649 --> 01:18:20.530]  Well, this is what led us to this.
[01:18:20.590 --> 01:18:26.713]  He had to go out across the world to get back all of his little recipe books of how to get back this one world power.
[01:18:27.353 --> 01:18:30.275]  And that's why he's on this breakneck speed to get it done now, because
[01:18:30.785 --> 01:18:32.866]  He's never been so close as he's been now.
[01:18:32.886 --> 01:18:35.286]  All right, let me get Alan's take on that, because he's our guest.
[01:18:35.306 --> 01:18:38.447]  Go ahead, Alan, what?
[01:18:38.807 --> 01:18:42.168]  The symbol of Nimrod is that, is world power.
[01:18:42.869 --> 01:18:57.453]  Nimrod is also the same as Satan, really, in the ancient literature, and his wife as well, as being the ultimate rebels who swore that they would rise higher than all the gods and dominate the universe, basically.
[01:18:57.933 --> 01:19:00.494]  So it's the same old power elite idea.
[01:19:01.189 --> 01:19:01.809]  Of course!
[01:19:16.798 --> 01:19:17.178]  Yes, that is true.
[01:19:17.198 --> 01:19:18.298]  Hitler did have his own special mediums.
[01:19:39.574 --> 01:19:40.915]  Yeah, he was entering the New Age.
[01:19:40.935 --> 01:19:42.236]  He was a theosophist.
[01:19:42.677 --> 01:19:46.980]  Theosophy is the same philosophy as the elite all believe in.
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:54.107]  Rockefeller himself sponsored the main magazine for the Lucis Trust, they used to call it the Lucifer Trust.
[01:19:54.847 --> 01:20:01.773]  And Lucifer to them, of course, is the epitome of the ideal intellectualized Superman to come.
[01:20:02.354 --> 01:20:06.037]  They believe they are the progenitors of the Superman to come.
[01:20:06.667 --> 01:20:10.670]  But they have to destroy this creation to build their new creation.
[01:20:11.171 --> 01:20:19.417]  Finishing up, caller Brian in Canada, with your point about your puppet Stephen Harper suspending Parliament with the Queen twice.
[01:20:21.159 --> 01:20:26.563]  Yeah, and that too, even though he suspends Parliament, he still has dictatorial powers during that period.
[01:20:26.944 --> 01:20:28.265]  Apparently didn't know that either.
[01:20:28.725 --> 01:20:30.046]  And we're seeing this all over the world.
[01:20:30.086 --> 01:20:30.787]  Anything else, Brian?
[01:20:31.530 --> 01:20:36.952]  Yeah, I was just saying that that drove me nuts up here because he even exposed himself in front of all of us.
[01:20:37.653 --> 01:20:40.294]  I was here the first few days that he called the election.
[01:20:40.734 --> 01:20:46.517]  The American market was crashing every day and the news would start to pressure him like, what about this?
[01:20:46.997 --> 01:20:54.260]  And the first few days he got very mad and adamant and said, Canada is not the United States and we're not going to suffer the same thing as them.
[01:20:54.820 --> 01:21:00.463]  And then four days later, when our economists started coming out saying, yes, Mr. Harper, we are going to suffer.
[01:21:01.004 --> 01:21:06.227]  Then he stood in front of the news and he stated that they knew about this 15 months ago and started taking measures.
[01:21:07.188 --> 01:21:08.789]  Right there, he exposed himself.
[01:21:09.049 --> 01:21:12.151]  Well, he waits for his lines.
[01:21:12.211 --> 01:21:14.693]  He's a bit behind the times.
[01:21:14.953 --> 01:21:17.034]  He waits for his lines being sent to him from London.
[01:21:19.915 --> 01:21:22.938]  You understand that Canada is still part of the British Commonwealth.
[01:21:22.998 --> 01:21:26.701]  Not one law gets passed in Canada without the Queen's signature.
[01:21:26.721 --> 01:21:28.803]  Even though they call it democracy.
[01:21:29.544 --> 01:21:34.709]  So he waits for his orders and they shift accordingly, according to the mood of the people.
[01:21:35.739 --> 01:21:37.140]  So he does what he's told.
[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:38.641]  He's a puppet, for sure.
[01:21:39.281 --> 01:21:40.842]  All right, Brian, thanks for the call.
[01:21:40.882 --> 01:21:44.683]  More calls straight ahead and this Shattered Union clip when I come out of break.
[01:21:44.723 --> 01:21:47.705]  Not just the audio now, if you're watching at PrisonPlanet.tv, you can see it.

[01:21:57.710 --> 01:22:00.391]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:04.395 --> 01:22:06.517]  The holidays are right around the corner.

[01:22:49.005 --> 01:22:53.868]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:22:53.888 --> 01:22:55.409]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:23:12.952 --> 01:23:13.973]  But who is the enemy?
[01:23:14.493 --> 01:23:15.014]  Bin Laden.
[01:23:15.294 --> 01:23:16.275]  This is his ammo.
[01:23:16.295 --> 01:23:17.596]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:23:17.636 --> 01:23:19.317]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:23:19.657 --> 01:23:26.423]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:23:26.823 --> 01:23:27.243]  Some U.S.
[01:23:27.303 --> 01:23:32.968]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:23:33.648 --> 01:23:37.129]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:23:37.149 --> 01:23:47.371]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:23:47.611 --> 01:23:48.351]  Fabled enemies.

[01:24:03.641 --> 01:24:13.728]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh, nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?

[01:25:26.184 --> 01:25:27.365]  I love this species.
[01:25:27.385 --> 01:25:31.946]  I love humanity and I have great hopes and dreams for my progeny.
[01:25:33.226 --> 01:25:35.167]  Living with your progeny in the future.
[01:25:35.387 --> 01:25:38.408]  I know I'm part of a great cycle of life.
[01:25:39.329 --> 01:25:54.796]  We're on a beautiful planet hurtling through space and I want to stop the greedy, controlling, covetous New World Order control freaks that are so greedy they want to control the future and shape humanity in their degraded, degenerate image.
[01:25:56.377 --> 01:25:58.059]  That's the basic psychology we're dealing with.
[01:25:58.079 --> 01:26:00.362]  I want to punch up on screen and we're going to go back to Alan Watt.
[01:26:00.382 --> 01:26:01.563]  I want to get his take on this.
[01:26:01.903 --> 01:26:06.709]  This is the trailer of one of, it's got to be more than 100 games, that push.
[01:26:06.729 --> 01:26:07.770]  We're going to have martial law.
[01:26:07.810 --> 01:26:08.731]  Things are going to break down.
[01:26:08.811 --> 01:26:11.274]  It's cute and funny and we're looking forward to it.
[01:26:11.695 --> 01:26:13.657]  This is all part of the acclamation.
[01:26:13.697 --> 01:26:14.858]  Here it is, Shattered Union.
[01:26:15.399 --> 01:26:18.543]  In a disputed election and a tie vote, the U.S.
[01:26:18.603 --> 01:26:21.647]  Congress installs the most unpopular president in U.S.
[01:26:21.687 --> 01:26:26.913]  history as David Jefferson Adams becomes the 44th president of the United States.
[01:26:27.514 --> 01:26:35.383]  Shortly after the election, increased unrest, rioting, and a growing number of militias have given rise to ever-increasing domestic terrorism.
[01:26:37.355 --> 01:26:44.457]  In response, the President invokes the Homeland Security Act and declares martial law on the West Coast and other areas of the country.
[01:26:45.057 --> 01:26:53.259]  Though highly contested, a Supreme Court ruling sidesteps the electoral process, disqualifying popular presidential candidates from several states.
[01:26:54.439 --> 01:27:01.341]  Public outrage explodes when a sham election leads to incumbent David Adams accepting a second term in office.
[01:27:03.584 --> 01:27:07.427]  During the 57th Inauguration Day Ceremonies, Washington D.C.
[01:27:07.527 --> 01:27:13.010]  is struck by a low-yield nuclear weapon, killing David Adams and most of the U.S.
[01:27:13.050 --> 01:27:13.411]  Congress.
[01:27:15.532 --> 01:27:17.533]  The destruction of Washington D.C.
[01:27:18.014 --> 01:27:21.896]  effectively breaks the chain of succession, sending the nation into chaos.
[01:27:22.597 --> 01:27:27.720]  In an emergency vote, the European Union deploys peacekeepers in the greater D.C.
[01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:30.322]  area to secure international interest.
[01:27:31.755 --> 01:27:39.160]  With separatist sentiment rising, California's governor declares home rule and secedes from the Union.
[01:27:39.981 --> 01:27:47.066]  Texas follows quickly and declares sovereignty, taking neighboring states with them and forming the Republic of Texas.
[01:27:49.027 --> 01:27:49.227]  Now.
[01:27:51.709 --> 01:27:55.291]  The once United States of America lie in ruin.
[01:27:57.072 --> 01:27:58.834]  The time for words has passed.
[01:27:59.795 --> 01:28:05.618]  And a second American Civil War now erupts as seven factions wage war across the land.
[01:28:07.179 --> 01:28:09.860]  They battle one another to reclaim a nation.
[01:28:11.181 --> 01:28:12.302]  To restore peace.
[01:28:13.622 --> 01:28:16.704]  To rebuild this shattered union.
[01:28:17.164 --> 01:28:17.565]  Alright.
[01:28:18.845 --> 01:28:21.867]  Now, notice they gave an Abraham Lincoln quote.
[01:28:23.155 --> 01:28:26.816]  Who is Barack Obama telling us that he's modeled after Abraham Lincoln?
[01:28:27.176 --> 01:28:30.558]  Now, the British came in and manipulated both sides, got the South to break off.
[01:28:30.618 --> 01:28:33.258]  My family was in the South, but I'll tell you right now, it was staged.
[01:28:33.319 --> 01:28:35.619]  British intelligence openly manipulated that.
[01:28:35.699 --> 01:28:39.881]  The Russian Empire sided with the North, the British sided with the South, giving them weapons.
[01:28:39.921 --> 01:28:41.141]  They meant to break up the country.
[01:28:41.381 --> 01:28:42.482]  That's now been declassified.
[01:28:42.502 --> 01:28:45.623]  That's in the major British annals, to try to break up the country.
[01:28:46.003 --> 01:28:47.683]  The same thing is being set up now.
[01:28:48.103 --> 01:28:49.164]  You do not want a riot.
[01:28:49.724 --> 01:28:57.488]  You want to defend your family, you want to take care of your family, you want to reach out to the military and police to educate them not to come out and confiscate guns.
[01:28:57.548 --> 01:29:03.550]  Now, once they do it, that's another subject, but you don't want to go out looking for them, trying to engage them.
[01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:04.491]  Police and military?
[01:29:05.211 --> 01:29:09.836]  If you don't out-and-out ignore those orders, you need to just sit on your butts and not be part of this.
[01:29:10.376 --> 01:29:12.839]  They're going to stage riots, they're going to prepare everybody.
[01:29:12.879 --> 01:29:13.880]  This is the game plan.
[01:29:13.900 --> 01:29:18.184]  If we get the word out on this, we may back them off, they may cancel the operation.
[01:29:18.224 --> 01:29:23.589]  We haven't had more big terror attacks staged here, though they were planning it because we exposed the false flag attacks of 9-11.
[01:29:24.770 --> 01:29:26.771]  You talk about predictive programming, Alan Watt.
[01:29:27.452 --> 01:29:34.496]  Hundreds of these video games have similar lines in them, and they are conditioning the public for this.
[01:29:34.556 --> 01:29:48.704]  When I would first air this two or three years ago, and other video game clips, people would laugh and say, that'll never come, we'll never have foreign troops, we'll never have... and now it's on the news that it is happening, and the Marines are in the West Coast, just like the States, running checkpoints.
[01:29:48.804 --> 01:29:53.827]  So, the people that made this game were definitely being given inside information, Alan Watt.
[01:29:56.483 --> 01:30:01.787]  The intelligence communities have basically been in charge of video games from their inception.
[01:30:02.267 --> 01:30:10.754]  That was their whole idea, was to militarize the public, at least get to the recruits that they'd want, who were conditioned to kill on sight when they were told to.
[01:30:11.574 --> 01:30:13.736]  And so they've always been in charge of video games.
[01:30:13.756 --> 01:30:21.302]  Otherwise, you know, we tend to think that industry and commerce just develops on its own happenstance, and that's not true.
[01:30:21.872 --> 01:30:22.112]  I don't
[01:30:41.710 --> 01:30:51.792]  They've been in charge of the whole culture industry, and now there are books coming out with declassified information admitting that the whole culture for 50 years has been controlled by the CIA.
[01:30:52.392 --> 01:31:03.335]  But the most recent movies coming out of Hollywood, I think nine of them are disaster-based movies, with this future scenario that's almost here, all on the same theme.
[01:31:03.695 --> 01:31:08.776]  So this is mainstream now, indoctrination and predictive programming of what's to come.
[01:31:09.515 --> 01:31:22.327]  And it ties in exactly with that Strategic Studies report from the military that said it might even break down to civil war within the United States, and even a civil war with nuclear weapons.
[01:31:22.427 --> 01:31:34.277]  And then we have Tommy Franks going on, and it turned out he was being paid $500,000 a year by the Pentagon to go out and give interviews in the press and print and TV going, I'm real sad, but martial law is the only thing that will keep you safe.
[01:31:34.978 --> 01:31:35.739]  It is coming.
[01:31:35.799 --> 01:31:37.880]  So again, oh, we think there might be riots.
[01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:38.440]  Boo hoo.
[01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:40.681]  We've got to go out and attack the American people.
[01:31:40.961 --> 01:31:50.567]  And again, now the Arizona police say, you know, we reported on this yesterday, dealing with the fact that the Army War College says they're preparing to attack the American people.
[01:31:50.587 --> 01:31:51.647]  That's going to be their main mission.
[01:31:52.048 --> 01:31:54.409]  Now, domestically, and people denied that the report was real.
[01:31:54.729 --> 01:31:58.391]  Here it is in the Arizona Business Journal for everybody in their face.
[01:31:58.411 --> 01:31:58.791]  Go ahead.
[01:31:59.672 --> 01:31:59.912]  Yes.
[01:32:00.152 --> 01:32:01.413]  So it's in the open now.
[01:32:01.929 --> 01:32:11.179]  That they're conditioning the general population to this is inevitable, and they do know that the bulk of the population will always sit in the back seat and watch what happens.
[01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:12.120]  They're afraid.
[01:32:12.140 --> 01:32:17.186]  See, violence itself, and law runs on the threat of violence, is coercion.
[01:32:17.631 --> 01:32:24.956]  Most people go along with law because they're coerced to do so, and coercion, if it's not followed or doesn't work, will be backed up with force.
[01:32:25.016 --> 01:32:33.822]  Most people understand that subconsciously, and they want to be left alone, and they hope that nothing drastic will happen to them if they sit back and let it happen.
[01:32:34.142 --> 01:32:38.845]  They don't realize that this is a war that's going to continue right down to the bottom level.
[01:32:39.412 --> 01:32:41.913]  And no one's going to be unscathed by it.
[01:32:41.993 --> 01:32:42.973]  You're not going to get out of it.
[01:32:43.033 --> 01:32:46.695]  So everyone must participate in stopping it from happening in the first place.
[01:32:47.215 --> 01:32:48.975]  That's how you stop these things from happening.
[01:32:49.115 --> 01:32:53.517]  Everyone's got to get involved now and stop being entertained by television.
[01:32:54.125 --> 01:32:54.485]  I think
[01:33:12.182 --> 01:33:14.224]  They bargained for an Ellen Wan and Alex Jones.
[01:33:14.845 --> 01:33:17.047]  You know they bargained for the people to resist.
[01:33:17.088 --> 01:33:23.855]  Though I've seen their white papers, I don't know if this is disinfo, that the rebellion is much bigger, much more coordinated, much more widespread.
[01:33:24.295 --> 01:33:30.282]  That's why they're saying they want to shut down the free web and take us to the internet too, as Google and of course Obama are doing.
[01:33:32.484 --> 01:33:35.025]  How do we feed into this, the wild card?
[01:33:35.045 --> 01:33:44.070]  Because it looks like things are not going well for them and we know they want to act like they're God and omnipresent and invincible and want to use AI to try to do that, but they really aren't.
[01:33:44.350 --> 01:33:50.533]  So how do shows like this and your website, Cutting Through the Matrix, how does all that feed into this?
[01:33:52.034 --> 01:34:00.918]  What they're afraid of are people who have the knowledge, the background, the history and the facts to back up the exclamations we're giving out right here.
[01:34:01.383 --> 01:34:03.964]  I don't know about you, but I've had overtures recently
[01:34:29.537 --> 01:34:32.298]  Well, I mean, I've had major radio networks try to hire me years ago.
[01:34:32.319 --> 01:34:36.841]  I've been approached by some of the biggest Hollywood studios wanting to put my material out.
[01:34:56.536 --> 01:34:58.517]  Kind of golden handcuffs, as they say.
[01:34:58.537 --> 01:35:05.921]  I know that I have been approached, and it's always under confidence, so I can't break that as a journalist, the confidence.
[01:35:06.561 --> 01:35:14.946]  But other things happen, like we call up Rothkopf, you know, former head of the Kissinger Group, who wrote the book, Superclass, earlier in the year, admitting that world government's here and they run everything.
[01:35:15.366 --> 01:35:17.547]  And when I got him on the line, my producer had set him up.
[01:35:17.767 --> 01:35:19.068]  He goes, I know who you are, Alex Jones.
[01:35:19.088 --> 01:35:20.248]  Yeah, yeah, we watch your work.
[01:35:20.288 --> 01:35:21.129]  You know, you really ought to
[01:35:21.949 --> 01:35:24.712]  John Harmon was the only witness to this.
[01:35:25.012 --> 01:35:26.694]  He was up in Minnesota and I was on the line with him.
[01:35:26.714 --> 01:35:28.956]  They called him saying, you know, you really ought to join us.
[01:35:29.536 --> 01:35:30.677]  There's nothing you can really do.
[01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:36.983]  I've had other people contact me and say, listen, the public's scum.
[01:35:37.264 --> 01:35:39.786]  You know they're a bunch of trash, a bunch of backstabbing garbage.
[01:35:40.607 --> 01:35:41.628]  They will destroy you.
[01:35:41.768 --> 01:35:42.609]  You need to join us.
[01:35:42.629 --> 01:35:43.369]  You're one of us.
[01:35:44.470 --> 01:35:46.452]  Yes, I have had those overtures and I know
[01:35:47.893 --> 01:35:50.035]  That's how the threat works.
[01:35:50.095 --> 01:35:51.836]  It's like, look, we're giving you a chance.
[01:35:52.116 --> 01:35:56.760]  We're not like Pol Pot who just killed anybody who could read or wore glasses, you know, who could see through his garbage.
[01:35:57.180 --> 01:36:07.127]  They try to co-opt and you think that rebuffing repeated co-ops is a sign that they're going to another level?
[01:36:08.128 --> 01:36:08.748]  Absolutely.
[01:36:09.269 --> 01:36:15.213]  When you get some coming one after another for world meetings, you know this is the last overture.
[01:36:15.905 --> 01:36:26.271]  And they've pretty well hinted in much of their writings from these institutes, the war colleges, etc., that they'll have to stop all agitators as they call it.
[01:36:26.567 --> 01:36:34.633]  Well, we must be getting through to them because we can be confronting Marines on the streets of Austin doing PSYOPs or Marine spokesmen in California.
[01:36:34.653 --> 01:36:37.496]  I mean, we call them up and we're like, oh, we know who you are, Alex Jones.
[01:36:37.536 --> 01:36:39.637]  Yeah, we're fully aware of your operations.
[01:36:39.677 --> 01:36:41.939]  And then they tell us all about our website and stories we wrote.
[01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:48.284]  I mean, so that tells me we're really having an effect when their own establishment is aware of what we're doing.
[01:36:48.304 --> 01:36:51.086]  I mean, it shows that we're having an effect.
[01:36:51.547 --> 01:36:52.648]  There's no doubt on that.
[01:36:53.747 --> 01:36:56.268]  I had some bureaucrats who went to Washington, D.C.
[01:36:56.328 --> 01:37:06.970]  in the cocktail parties, and people were mentioning the names that are making a difference, and it's common talk amongst those particular classes.
[01:37:07.290 --> 01:37:09.470]  So we are making some difference, absolutely.
[01:37:09.490 --> 01:37:13.551]  We're being noticed, and not just noticed, but timely monitored and watched.
[01:37:14.951 --> 01:37:16.792]  Bill Clinton was in town last year.
[01:37:17.972 --> 01:37:25.496]  And my mother's, my wife's mother has been active in the Democratic Party, so it was a Democratic Party dinner.
[01:37:25.817 --> 01:37:29.379]  There was about a hundred people there, and they're all around Bill Clinton talking.
[01:37:30.799 --> 01:37:37.123]  And somebody said, what do you think, not my wife's mother, but one of her friends said, what do you think about Alex Jones?
[01:37:37.143 --> 01:37:40.045]  You know, the radio and TV guy who's talking about the New World Order.
[01:37:40.505 --> 01:37:47.029]  And Bill Clinton said, let me think of the exact quote, Alex Jones
[01:37:49.225 --> 01:38:12.724]  is one of the most important commentators and what he's saying is some of the most important things being said in the world and they said you mean Alex Jones the you know the young anti-new world order guy he said yeah Alex Jones and mentioned some things I mean that is that is just absolutely incredible and it's kind of bone-chilling Allen yeah well they are monitoring as I say anyone who they claim
[01:38:13.408 --> 01:38:17.150]  As an agitator or someone that can break through the matrix.
[01:38:17.190 --> 01:38:19.050]  But why would he say something nice about me?
[01:38:20.311 --> 01:38:21.772]  It doesn't necessarily be nice.
[01:38:22.372 --> 01:38:24.893]  See, what you're saying is what we are saying is important.
[01:38:24.913 --> 01:38:25.813]  In other words, it's true.
[01:38:27.074 --> 01:38:32.056]  And of course, it means that because it's so true, they cannot ignore it.
[01:38:32.796 --> 01:38:39.199]  But they also hope the public or the general public will be overwhelmed with the regular media, which keeps them in limbo.
[01:38:40.126 --> 01:38:41.627]  Well, Alan, isn't there something even more?
[01:38:42.067 --> 01:38:55.737]  Within the pyramidal structure, according to Rothkopf and others, and I agree, there's only about 3,000 to 6,000 people that even have 95% of the big picture and that we've reverse-engineered from their documents and reading different compartments of their operation.
[01:38:56.477 --> 01:39:24.876]  really accurately what they're doing and so the few commentators or reporters out there that actually know what they're doing and accurately reporting it uh... they are recognizing that because even within their own elite most their people don't realize the big picture and i think that's another danger is members of the elite members of the establishment who didn't have the full picture are hearing and seeing what we have to say and i think that's causing them some problems and another example is a general stubble mines wife dr labo
[01:39:25.436 --> 01:39:32.022]  What I found, and this is factual as well, when governments, the US government and the Canadian government, and I think the British one too,
[01:39:53.970 --> 01:39:57.352]  Stop their employees from going into my website at their work.
[01:39:57.372 --> 01:39:58.693]  It's banned now.
[01:39:58.713 --> 01:39:59.353]  They can't get in.
[01:39:59.373 --> 01:40:01.515]  Lots of them have told me that.
[01:40:01.595 --> 01:40:08.119]  When that's happened, you see, it's more important to them that their bureaucrats live under their own little illusions.
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:14.584]  They cannot afford to have their bureaucracies waking up because that really is important to them.
[01:40:14.664 --> 01:40:19.667]  They are generally kept in a state of double think, double speak.
[01:40:20.067 --> 01:40:20.708]  They're never really
[01:40:21.226 --> 01:40:27.151]  But when you come out, when they hear people talking the truth, the work they're involved in suddenly becomes more clear to them.
[01:40:27.191 --> 01:40:32.496]  They realize the whys and the wherefores for the first time, because they themselves have been heavily programmed.
[01:40:33.136 --> 01:40:34.978]  And that's what the leaders are afraid of.
[01:40:35.598 --> 01:40:38.321]  The elites need the massive bureaucratic class.
[01:40:39.283 --> 01:40:42.304]  To guide all of this into place and to keep it working.
[01:40:42.484 --> 01:40:51.727]  And historically it's the minion servant class to the elite that is one of the most surveilled, oppressed, controlled and murdered and abused groups.
[01:40:51.767 --> 01:40:54.168]  So they need to come out and join Free Humanity.
[01:40:54.208 --> 01:41:01.230]  And yes, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, a band in Europe at the major train stations and quote free government Wi-Fi's.
[01:41:01.650 --> 01:41:03.030]  Banned in government institutions.
[01:41:03.110 --> 01:41:03.851]  Banned at Dell.
[01:41:04.151 --> 01:41:05.451]  Cut into thematrix.com.
[01:41:05.491 --> 01:41:08.512]  I've seen the screenshots online where it says banned.
[01:41:08.552 --> 01:41:09.452]  This is extreme.
[01:41:09.732 --> 01:41:13.333]  But all you're doing is posting and reporting on their own documents, Alan.
[01:41:13.733 --> 01:41:16.114]  I want to come back and take a few final calls.
[01:41:16.134 --> 01:41:18.455]  We've got to have you back again soon from Tim, Sherry, Tom, and Elliot.
[01:41:18.475 --> 01:41:20.535]  I don't know how many we can get to, but we're going to try.
[01:41:20.955 --> 01:41:27.457]  But before we end this segment, what are some of the things that are most important to you right now that we haven't covered, Alan?
[01:41:28.377 --> 01:41:30.058]  The important things really are
[01:41:32.186 --> 01:41:34.767]  It follows what you've been talking about.
[01:41:34.787 --> 01:41:36.108]  They're watching us as well.
[01:41:36.128 --> 01:41:44.054]  What they're looking for, not so much for people who simply put the information out, but can those people be potential leaders?
[01:41:44.174 --> 01:41:52.860]  If you have that ability to bring people together with a common stance on something, then you're very, very, very dangerous.
[01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:58.304]  And they're waiting to see how we react, how we on the radio react.
[01:41:58.979 --> 01:41:59.939]  We're being used as a gauge.
[01:41:59.999 --> 01:42:04.241]  We're being used as an overall war game to see how the public's responding.
[01:42:18.584 --> 01:42:27.391]  With ways and innovative ways they haven't foreseen to start to get people bonding together in a common stance against this tyranny.
[01:42:27.711 --> 01:42:30.433]  If we have that ability, we are very, very dangerous.
[01:42:31.534 --> 01:42:32.555]  Well, it's a little too late.
[01:42:32.595 --> 01:42:33.816]  I mean, this canary's sung.
[01:42:33.876 --> 01:42:38.799]  I mean, we put our information out, and I think that's the only reason we're still walking around, Alan Watt.
[01:42:39.580 --> 01:42:40.180]  It probably is.
[01:42:40.681 --> 01:42:47.026]  If we go to the next level of advising what to do with them, we'll be very, very well noticed then.
[01:42:47.751 --> 01:42:56.234]  Alright, I want to skip this break for JustPrisonPlanet.tv viewers and for folks listening to the InfoWars.com audio streams.
[01:42:56.254 --> 01:43:00.816]  For everybody else in the AM and FM shortwave satellite, we'll be right back in three minutes to jam in some final calls.
[01:43:00.836 --> 01:43:01.236]  Stay with us.
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:06.582]  Alan, I think they're going to have trouble killing us.
[01:43:07.402 --> 01:43:17.950]  Instead, what I see happening is this flotilla of mainstream TV shows demonizing myself and others, attacking 9-11 Truth, attacking the alternative media, and then trying to shut down the web.
[01:43:18.250 --> 01:43:24.295]  Now, then down the road, they may try to set us up with some type of crime or burn us out, as they've tried to physically do with you.
[01:43:24.355 --> 01:43:25.175]  Do you concur with that?
[01:43:26.036 --> 01:43:27.257]  That's very, very possible.
[01:43:27.277 --> 01:43:30.139]  As I said, if they can't win you over, they have to eliminate you.
[01:43:30.723 --> 01:43:39.360]  And if you do have the ability to guide lots of people in a common purpose or cause, then they'll definitely have to do something about it.
[01:43:39.582 --> 01:43:43.224]  Well, I want to state on record that the elite is not invincible, and we've had many victories against them.
[01:43:43.704 --> 01:43:52.788]  The only way to stop them, though, is to get the mass, large portions of it, like Winston finally figures out that the secret is the proles, not what he's always been told about it being the party and the inner party.
[01:43:53.148 --> 01:44:00.652]  We have to find people out there in the general public that will resist and will speak out, and I see that happening.
[01:44:00.672 --> 01:44:01.713]  Let's go ahead and go to some calls.
[01:44:02.013 --> 01:44:03.834]  Tim in Ohio, you're on the air with Alan Watt.
[01:44:03.854 --> 01:44:04.434]  Thanks for holding.
[01:44:08.156 --> 01:44:08.696]  Go ahead, Tim.
[01:44:10.026 --> 01:44:10.466]  Hi Alex.
[01:44:10.827 --> 01:44:11.447]  Yes sir, go ahead.
[01:44:11.467 --> 01:44:14.210]  I haven't talked to you in a while and a couple of things.
[01:44:14.450 --> 01:44:15.451]  A comment and a question.
[01:44:15.471 --> 01:44:21.917]  I haven't talked to you since the convention and I have never ever seen evil personified in a woman's face like that.
[01:44:21.997 --> 01:44:23.479]  Michelle Malkin.
[01:44:23.999 --> 01:44:24.900]  Oh my God.
[01:44:25.481 --> 01:44:26.622]  She should change her name to Medusa.
[01:44:26.782 --> 01:44:44.151]  I mean, look how they sent people in that were with her and left with her to scream, kill Michelle Malkin, so could then be put all over radio and TV and try to get me blackballed, and it almost happened until it backfired because other videos got up on YouTube showing that they were with her, that the whole deal was staged, and then she had to back off and admit I didn't say that.
[01:44:44.791 --> 01:44:46.772]  But that was very close.
[01:44:46.792 --> 01:44:48.133]  Yeah, very bad.
[01:44:48.233 --> 01:44:48.733]  Allen, are you there?
[01:44:48.753 --> 01:44:50.074]  Yes.
[01:44:50.774 --> 01:44:52.555]  I want a question for both of you.
[01:44:52.715 --> 01:44:53.876]  Knowing that disdain
[01:44:54.474 --> 01:44:57.036]  That the elite have for the black race.
[01:44:57.677 --> 01:44:59.979]  You know, why would they pick Obama for president?
[01:45:00.279 --> 01:45:05.043]  And will it play out that Obama's going to be exposed and Biden be inaugurated?
[01:45:05.063 --> 01:45:09.246]  Well, what's going to happen is they're going to use him as a puppet for a while, then they're going to destroy his name forever.
[01:45:09.607 --> 01:45:13.069]  And yes, it will be used away to to to demonize black people.
[01:45:13.129 --> 01:45:14.050]  Comments, Alan, why?
[01:45:14.631 --> 01:45:15.251]  Black people.
[01:45:15.331 --> 01:45:19.655]  And then Hillary, I think if he steps down, will take over as president and then she'll
[01:45:20.071 --> 01:45:20.531]  Yes, that's right.
[01:45:35.786 --> 01:45:39.089]  And probably will cause some kind of civil war within the U.S.
[01:45:39.229 --> 01:45:40.210]  as it sparks off.
[01:45:40.290 --> 01:45:44.793]  Obama will use all the forces that have been put on the books by the Bush regime.
[01:45:45.013 --> 01:45:46.394]  He set up the machinery for it.
[01:45:46.434 --> 01:45:47.475]  Obama will use it.
[01:45:47.895 --> 01:45:48.536]  He'll be hated.
[01:45:48.576 --> 01:45:51.078]  He'll probably eventually step down or go off sick.
[01:45:51.178 --> 01:45:52.359]  He'll just leave it sick.
[01:45:52.999 --> 01:45:54.761]  And Hillary will probably take over.
[01:45:54.901 --> 01:45:57.103]  And then, of course, she'll be the real vixen.
[01:45:57.123 --> 01:45:58.304]  She'll use ultimate force.
[01:45:58.464 --> 01:45:59.044]  Tim, hold on.
[01:45:59.064 --> 01:46:00.205]  We're coming back to the full audience.
[01:46:00.245 --> 01:46:01.286]  I'll let you have one more comment.
[01:46:01.306 --> 01:46:02.187]  Appreciate your calling.
[01:46:02.207 --> 01:46:02.507]  Here we go.
[01:46:05.792 --> 01:46:07.534]  Okay, let's hurry here.
[01:46:09.635 --> 01:46:13.198]  Tim, finish up the comments from Ohio, then Sherry and others.
[01:46:13.218 --> 01:46:15.380]  I want to jam in a few more here.
[01:46:15.420 --> 01:46:26.068]  Just as a follow-up to my question was, if they do not have Obama or Biden in, what are the chances of Cheney and little old temporary Bush
[01:46:26.764 --> 01:46:35.231]  Uh, remaining in power after Inauguration Day due to some type of false... Look, I don't... Look, look, they want a new puppet to get... I mean, they've invested too much in Obama.
[01:46:35.311 --> 01:46:38.974]  I believe he's going to go into office and then it's going to be really serious.
[01:46:39.254 --> 01:46:39.715]  Alan Watt?
[01:46:40.215 --> 01:46:41.416]  No, I concur with that, Tim.
[01:46:41.736 --> 01:46:42.657]  Alright, gotta jump, Tim.
[01:46:42.857 --> 01:46:43.758]  Appreciate the call.
[01:46:43.798 --> 01:46:45.219]  Let's talk to Sherry in Texas.
[01:46:45.259 --> 01:46:46.640]  Sherry, you're on the air.
[01:46:46.681 --> 01:46:47.001]  Welcome.
[01:46:48.032 --> 01:46:52.275]  Hey, Alan, I just wanted to say that you're my sociological guru.
[01:46:52.495 --> 01:46:53.876]  I think you're right on the money.
[01:46:54.397 --> 01:46:58.620]  I know you've been studying systems for a long time, and I really think you know what you're talking about.
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:12.009]  My question for you is, how are the elite able to get such strong people, you know, like in the upper middle class in America, to accept the dehumanization and also the Yasser genocide?
[01:47:13.277 --> 01:47:13.818]  Yes, it's incremental.
[01:47:13.938 --> 01:47:15.120]  It's intergenerational dehumanization.
[01:47:27.864 --> 01:47:36.648]  You have three generations sitting watching television together and the oldest is embarrassed at regular fare for viewers and entertainment.
[01:47:36.748 --> 01:47:37.928]  The young ones don't mind.
[01:47:37.968 --> 01:47:39.969]  The one in the middle is already accepting it.
[01:47:40.369 --> 01:47:43.410]  So it's intergenerational indoctrination and propaganda.
[01:47:43.430 --> 01:47:44.091]  That's right.
[01:47:44.111 --> 01:47:44.771]  Dehumanization.
[01:47:45.071 --> 01:47:45.351]  That's right.
[01:47:45.371 --> 01:47:51.794]  They train people to love tyranny, to love evil, to feel like they're part of the winning team, to associate themselves with the system.
[01:47:52.234 --> 01:47:58.017]  And again, they act like sex and violence and destruction is cool and, you know, the nerds just don't understand.
[01:47:58.277 --> 01:48:03.099]  Really, they're searing the conscience so you'll accept your neighbors being drug off or yourself being drug off.
[01:48:03.339 --> 01:48:05.340]  And so when you're being drug off, your neighbors will accept it.
[01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:05.660]  Sherry?
[01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:08.201]  That's exactly right.
[01:48:08.261 --> 01:48:11.643]  And also, as far as the cancer rate here, it's just
[01:48:12.130 --> 01:48:12.730]  Skyrocketing.
[01:48:12.810 --> 01:48:20.555]  And they actually have a big room with all these comfy chairs where all the ladies who have cancer, they sit and they get to socialize while they get their chemo.
[01:48:20.575 --> 01:48:22.817]  And they make it a social fun thing.
[01:48:23.157 --> 01:48:23.998]  I appreciate your call.
[01:48:24.018 --> 01:48:24.978]  We're out of time, Sherry.
[01:48:25.258 --> 01:48:27.880]  And I apologize to Tom, Elliot, Grace and others.
[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:30.022]  Next time Alan's on, you can call in.
[01:48:30.042 --> 01:48:31.242]  You'll go to the head of the line.
[01:48:32.203 --> 01:48:34.925]  Alan Watt, I really want to appreciate you coming on the show.
[01:48:34.945 --> 01:48:36.065]  Go to TheMatrix.com.
[01:48:36.406 --> 01:48:38.247]  Give folks your European mirror site.
[01:48:39.045 --> 01:48:45.312]  Yes, Alan Watt sent in sentinel.eu and in transcripts you can download and print up in the different languages.
[01:48:45.692 --> 01:48:49.376]  Alright, we appreciate all your time and we appreciate your tireless work for humanity.
[01:48:49.416 --> 01:48:54.261]  I want to talk to you again coming up early in the new year as things develop and things unfold.
[01:48:54.281 --> 01:48:55.102]  Thank you, Alan Watt.
[01:48:55.518 --> 01:48:56.379]  It's been a pleasure, Alex.
[01:48:56.659 --> 01:48:58.400]  Always a pleasure having you on, a true gentleman.
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:00.821]  We got a lot of information out in that show today.
[01:49:00.841 --> 01:49:03.683]  We've been live for almost two hours at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:49:03.703 --> 01:49:12.808]  If you're watching the live streams, we're also going to be posting this for PrisonPlanet.tv members in the highest quality that we have up on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:49:12.828 --> 01:49:13.909]  We're about to upgrade.
[01:49:14.049 --> 01:49:16.110]  The films I post are in super high, almost high def.
[01:49:16.610 --> 01:49:27.395]  These, so they can be streamed out, are in lower quality, but we're about to start encoding and recording another copy that's in even higher quality to post for PrisonPlanet.tv members in the next few weeks.
[01:49:27.455 --> 01:49:30.316]  We are working to make it all as good as we can for you.
[01:49:30.716 --> 01:49:36.238]  Before I end this broadcast, I do want to tell you that the rebroadcast is coming up with Congressman Ron Paul at the very start.
[01:49:36.498 --> 01:49:44.342]  It'll be re-airing on AM and FM stations across the country whenever they rebroadcast us, and on WWCR from 9 to 1 AM this evening.
[01:49:45.402 --> 01:49:54.408]  But right now on the streams, he was on at the 5 After at Infowars.com on the restreams and you can download of course the free podcast there as well.
[01:49:55.168 --> 01:50:05.275]  Get prepared, get self-sufficient and one big way to do that is eFoodsDirect.com, the letter E, foodsdirect.com, big banners up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:50:05.295 --> 01:50:11.839]  This is the highest quality storable foods company for the best price I've found, non-GMO, healthy, grown right here in America.
[01:50:12.039 --> 01:50:16.484]  E-food stores for more than 10 years and climate control 10 years and non-climate control 800-409-5633 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com
[01:50:24.807 --> 01:50:25.928]  We had Mike Rivera on.
[01:50:26.889 --> 01:50:32.373]  We had Alan Watt on and Ron Paul right now when we come back on the internet streams at Infowars.com.
[01:50:32.393 --> 01:50:36.736]  But be sure and check out efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:50:37.076 --> 01:50:40.118]  Great job to the crew, the affiliates, the sponsors, John Harmon, everybody.
[01:50:40.358 --> 01:50:41.259]  God bless you all.
[01:50:41.319 --> 01:50:42.420]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:50:45.742 --> 01:50:47.304]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
