[00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:05.811]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.472 --> 00:00:07.512]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.232 --> 00:00:09.353]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.993 --> 00:00:10.793]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.574 --> 00:00:12.474]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.494 --> 00:00:16.816]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.316 --> 00:00:21.378]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.816 --> 00:00:40.218]  Well, for the rest of this hour, we're joined by professor, author, Peter Dale Scott.
[00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:46.082]  Always enjoy interviewing him over the last 12 years or so that I've had a chance to have him on a couple times a year.
[00:00:46.742 --> 00:00:53.146]  And Peter Dale Scott is a Canadian poet and former English professor at the University of California, Berkeley.
[00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:55.547]  And he has been an advisor to...
[00:00:57.748 --> 00:01:10.157]  I mean, the bio is so long, it would take hours, and I go over all of his literary works, his investigations, and the government drug trafficking into the deep state, you know, the shadow government, the true ruling elite.
[00:01:11.138 --> 00:01:17.362]  He has got a new book out right now, always out there on the forefront of research.
[00:01:17.402 --> 00:01:20.685]  And today, I wanted to get his take on the Russia situation briefly.
[00:01:21.705 --> 00:01:27.951]  Who the true shadow government is, who the deep state is, past Barack Obama, John McCain, George Bush, and the neocons.
[00:01:28.472 --> 00:01:39.082]  We see this police state control grid, the spying apparatus on citizens just growing, expanding, decade after decade, year after year, now really coming to a climax it seems.
[00:01:39.662 --> 00:01:45.965]  First of all, I want to say I'm pleased and honored to be back on your show, and I guess what I want people to know most is that
[00:02:07.682 --> 00:02:11.245]  In the last two years, I've come out with not one, but two new books.
[00:02:12.126 --> 00:02:20.672]  One called The Road to 9-11, and the other one, a vastly expanded reissue of my first book, The War Conspiracy.
[00:02:21.313 --> 00:02:29.900]  And rather than describe them at length, people can just Google for me, and at the very top, they'll see... Google for Peter Dale Scott.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.224]  You'll see my website, which is www.peterdalescott.net.
[00:02:36.093 --> 00:02:40.435]  And I have a politics page on there that begins with a description of these two books.
[00:02:40.915 --> 00:02:43.957]  So thank you for giving me a chance to work all that in.
[00:02:44.797 --> 00:02:45.637]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:02:45.717 --> 00:03:02.325]  Let's get into currently what's happening, just a basic synopsis from your unique perspective, and whether you think the elite is in crisis, or whether things are going well for them, and then who that deep state is, who the shadow government are, who controls it, where we're going, what their goals are.
[00:03:03.496 --> 00:03:12.960]  Well, because it is a deep state and a shadow government, I'm very much on the outside and just trying to put together clues.
[00:03:14.061 --> 00:03:28.307]  But I think that, in a sense, we've had one since World War II, and particularly the decision, you know, there was a kind of mood of panic right after World War II about the Russians, and I remember it.
[00:03:28.407 --> 00:03:31.709]  I didn't, as a Canadian, I didn't really participate in it.
[00:03:32.318 --> 00:03:44.769]  But I remember friends whom I respected who were sincere in their fear that if America didn't fight to dominate the world, then Russia would, the Soviet Union, would take it over.
[00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:50.034]  And then they built that tool to, quote, save us, and it inevitably turned into the Great Tyranny.
[00:03:50.615 --> 00:03:58.282]  Well, what they did specifically, I'm trying to be hard-edged and narrow in my facts here, they created this
[00:03:58.996 --> 00:04:06.518]  Special adjunct to the, well they created the Central Intelligence Agency for one thing, but then they went beyond that.
[00:04:07.398 --> 00:04:15.420]  At least the CIA was created by a statute, although the powers it now exercises were not envisaged in that statute.
[00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:27.243]  But when they went further and created something called OPC, the Office of Policy Coordination, such an innocent title, but in fact a very heavy agency,
[00:04:28.235 --> 00:04:33.436]  Uh, whose, uh, function was, uh, defined as the subversion of other governments.
[00:04:34.056 --> 00:04:45.079]  Well, if you create an apparatus that's very skilled at subverting other governments, it's not at all surprising if you get some blowback and that one of the governments that's being subverted is our own.
[00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:56.801]  And what I refer to as the Deep State is the, its, uh, origins are in that it was actually a huge apparatus at one point, larger than the CIA.
[00:04:57.811 --> 00:05:01.673]  And eventually was creating many, many problems for America.
[00:05:01.953 --> 00:05:04.394]  And then it simply became Continuity of Government.
[00:05:04.434 --> 00:05:12.518]  I know I'm oversimplifying it, and now that's... You're jumping a bit, but yes, to shorten the whole narrative, you began... Well, I don't want to shorten it.
[00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:13.499]  I mean, let's go back.
[00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:15.440]  I just wanted to jump ahead for a moment.
[00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.321]  No, no, that was a good thing you said that.
[00:05:18.121 --> 00:05:23.364]  In the 40s, it was OPC, and in our decade, it's COG.
[00:05:23.905 --> 00:05:39.415]  from one set of misleading initials to another, because continuity of government, as I always say, if you're planning for COG involves suspending the Constitution, well then it's better to call it change of government than continuity of government.
[00:05:54.259 --> 00:06:07.656]  One of the real elements of continuity through all of this is the fact that OPC got involved not just in dealing with drug traffickers, but actually in the Far East building up
[00:06:08.437 --> 00:06:15.982]  ...drug traffic as a kind of capitalist resource against communism in China and Southeast Asia.
[00:06:16.022 --> 00:06:24.188]  And again, there's that very deeply evil idea of, and justifies the means, well, if the Soviets are making money running child kidnapping rings, we better.
[00:06:24.528 --> 00:06:28.410]  Well, if the Soviets are dealing cocaine and heroin, we better take control of it.
[00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:35.175]  You know, it's always, we're doing all this evil because we have to guard the truth with a bodyguard of lies.
[00:06:35.953 --> 00:06:43.980]  Well, as I say, it began in a mood of fear, but it went on to a mood of global dominance.
[00:06:44.101 --> 00:06:44.741]  It changed.
[00:06:45.302 --> 00:06:57.553]  At the beginning, it was a question of fear that if we didn't control the flow of opium in Southeast Asia, then the Chinese communists would.
[00:06:57.613 --> 00:07:01.717]  Whether that was true or not, I actually doubt that it was, because
[00:07:02.372 --> 00:07:14.215]  You know, opium had been such a scourge to China that one of the things that was really motivating the Chinese Communists very powerfully was to end the scourge of opium.
[00:07:14.555 --> 00:07:27.878]  That had been used by the Western powers to control, to get into China, to then break it up, and let's not forget Skull and Bones, which predominantly founded the CIA in 1947, was founded with opium money out of the Russell's.
[00:07:27.938 --> 00:07:29.539]  So far enough back, that's quite true.
[00:07:30.299 --> 00:07:33.020]  We all know it was never good.
[00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:39.242]  I mean, they sold the young men that went and joined and murdered and killed and did all this evil to fight communism.
[00:07:39.282 --> 00:07:41.943]  But up top, the big boys knew what it was really about.
[00:07:42.683 --> 00:07:46.664]  Well, you know, it was an ugly situation in Asia.
[00:07:46.704 --> 00:07:49.605]  The communists were doing ugly things, too.
[00:07:51.526 --> 00:07:56.467]  And as I say, rightly or wrongly, the decision was made.
[00:07:57.047 --> 00:07:59.308]  But because it was made in secret,
[00:07:59.804 --> 00:08:02.447]  It was never made with rational reassessment.
[00:08:02.487 --> 00:08:18.922]  Most policies of the government are ones which are reassessed from time to time, but the involvement with the drug traffickers was so secret that there was no overview, no reassessment.
[00:08:19.751 --> 00:08:36.881]  And it turned Burma, which before the war had not been a major part of the global opium scene, it turned Burma into the major supplier of opium and heroin for the world.
[00:08:36.941 --> 00:08:47.768]  And then, ironically, as the Vietnam War scaled down and the Americans pulled out, one of the consequences was that the
[00:08:48.362 --> 00:09:15.190]  Burmese opium production also scaled down, and we might have actually been able to lick the heroin problem in the world, except that within a decade, there we were, the CIA was in Afghanistan, and helping now to build up opium, well, helping to build up is a bit strong.
[00:09:15.785 --> 00:09:30.415]  But backing the people who energetically build up opium and heroin production in... Well, you gotta have some way to put our young people in prisons and have cops in black uniforms stomping around searching everyone, I mean, you know.
[00:09:32.156 --> 00:09:42.943]  It has become part of the social fabric of this country, and particularly, of course, it weighs very heavily on the ethnic populations, blacks and Hispanics.
[00:09:43.635 --> 00:09:44.176]  I think so.
[00:09:59.416 --> 00:10:04.418]  than regular cocaine, which is used by the upper middle class of the white population.
[00:10:04.478 --> 00:10:09.901]  Well, in Russia, Limbaugh can take a hundred Oxycontins a day, that's synthetic heroin, that's alright, he doesn't get in trouble.
[00:10:10.461 --> 00:10:24.748]  But a young black man or anybody else is found with a cocaine, they're gonna go to prison for a very, very long time, and then, you know, they need slaves in the prisons, and I've looked... Well, I'm very worried about this policy, just from a national security point of view.
[00:10:24.768 --> 00:10:25.668]  Oh, I am too, yeah.
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.561]  You know, in this country we have two kinds of Muslims.
[00:10:29.761 --> 00:10:43.604]  We have, ironically, some of the most affluent Muslims outside of the Islamic areas are in this country and are basically very well assimilated.
[00:10:44.924 --> 00:10:52.126]  But the prisons are recruiting grounds for the black Muslims and there are different trends among them.
[00:10:52.206 --> 00:10:55.807]  Some of them, again, I think most of the black Muslims
[00:10:56.502 --> 00:11:13.215]  Their aspirations are to be middle class and to join the American mainstream, but there are some deviant elements recruiting in the prisons and actually getting people to go over to these training camps in Afghanistan.
[00:11:13.816 --> 00:11:25.005]  I think that because all of our policies are so irrational, so crazy in this area, there's no rational assessment of the danger that I'm aware of.
[00:11:25.826 --> 00:11:30.449]  Of the danger that this presents for our country.
[00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:48.539]  Well, when we come back, I want to get more into drug trafficking with Peter Del Scott, but also, deep government, Continue Government, in and around the 9-11 attacks, and what you think the Continue Government system, our private owners, what are they planning for us in the future, from the activities you're charting and what they're doing?
[00:11:48.679 --> 00:11:50.340]  I mean, I've never seen a build-up.
[00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:52.571]  This big domestically.
[00:11:52.631 --> 00:11:53.711]  I mean, this is massive.
[00:11:53.771 --> 00:11:54.632]  It's industrial.
[00:11:54.672 --> 00:11:56.513]  It's focused on the average people.
[00:11:57.393 --> 00:11:58.294]  What are they planning?
[00:11:58.574 --> 00:11:59.314]  Peter Dale Scott.
[00:12:00.935 --> 00:12:02.516]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:12:02.756 --> 00:12:03.977]  August 20th, 2008.
[00:12:04.377 --> 00:12:06.198]  Gold open today at 8.11.10.
[00:12:06.419 --> 00:12:09.901]  One ounce gold coins can be purchased for 8.35.48, 4.11.75 for half ounce, and 2.05.88 for quarter ounce.
[00:12:09.921 --> 00:12:10.281]  That's 8.35.48, 4.11.75, and 2.05.88.
[00:12:18.163 --> 00:12:23.749]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[00:12:23.809 --> 00:12:27.833]  treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing a yon revolution.
[00:12:28.113 --> 00:12:36.021]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[00:12:36.061 --> 00:12:38.444]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[00:12:38.724 --> 00:12:42.326]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[00:12:42.526 --> 00:12:48.490]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.
[00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:52.092]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[00:12:52.132 --> 00:12:55.074]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.

[00:12:55.494 --> 00:12:55.754]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:12:55.774 --> 00:12:59.296]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero, and we knew what to do.
[00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:09.721]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:13:09.922 --> 00:13:16.351]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:13:16.971 --> 00:13:25.483]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:13:25.868 --> 00:13:32.672]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:13:32.953 --> 00:13:36.015]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:13:36.135 --> 00:13:41.358]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:13:41.898 --> 00:13:44.520]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[00:15:03.192 --> 00:15:06.794]  Look, up there in the sky, it's Non-X-Man.
[00:15:07.434 --> 00:15:08.595]  He's in a dive.
[00:15:09.095 --> 00:15:11.096]  He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach.
[00:15:11.617 --> 00:15:12.397]  Let's go look.
[00:15:12.937 --> 00:15:16.199]  I'm Non-X-Man, and your toenails need Non-X nail gel.
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.061]  Stop hiding them in the sand.
[00:15:18.621 --> 00:15:20.142]  Take them out, let's see them.
[00:15:22.509 --> 00:15:24.650]  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
[00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:25.470]  Don't worry.
[00:15:25.991 --> 00:15:27.331]  Now there's Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:15:27.831 --> 00:15:31.913]  Use it on your toenails regularly, and they'll look fantastic in sandals.
[00:15:32.534 --> 00:15:34.815]  Oh, I will, Non-X Man.
[00:15:35.155 --> 00:15:35.455]  Great.
[00:15:35.995 --> 00:15:38.896]  Well, I'm off to find more ugly toenails.
[00:15:41.117 --> 00:15:43.739]  Don't let Non-X Man find you with unsightly toenails.
[00:15:44.219 --> 00:15:47.680]  Buy diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:15:48.221 --> 00:15:49.121]  It's in the foot care aisle
[00:15:52.062 --> 00:16:09.199]  Peter Dale Scott is our guest, really a top academic studying the shadow government, government narcotics trafficking.
[00:16:09.219 --> 00:16:12.843]  But to say government, it's private industry that takes control of government.
[00:16:14.633 --> 00:16:17.836]  And when they call it Continuity of Government, they're being honest.
[00:16:18.377 --> 00:16:29.729]  This means continuing with shadow government, continuing the corporate ownership of our government, continuing using it to tax us, regulate us, control us, mining us, as really a commodity.
[00:16:30.755 --> 00:16:35.319]  Well, I actually know very little about continuity of government like everybody else.
[00:16:35.339 --> 00:16:36.980]  I think the first thing to understand is
[00:16:59.429 --> 00:17:04.992]  It's so secret that even Congress isn't allowed to know what continuity of government means.
[00:17:05.552 --> 00:17:19.659]  And we had kind of a showdown, or we should have had a showdown, in Congress just exactly a year ago, when Congressman DeFazio was on the Homeland Security Committee.
[00:17:19.719 --> 00:17:27.243]  He noticed that the president, in a national security presidential memorandum under 51,
[00:17:28.675 --> 00:17:39.861]  ...had renewed the state of emergency and there were some secret annexes which contained provisions about continuity of government, COG.
[00:17:40.281 --> 00:17:54.209]  So he asked to see them and was told he couldn't see them and then his whole committee, Homeland Security Committee, asked in writing to see them and we're told that the committee did not have the clearances to see this.
[00:17:54.813 --> 00:18:11.463]  Well, when you consider that one of the few things that is being repeatedly said about COG, and it was said way back in the 1980s... They always claim that Congress is involved, Congress is co-equal, but now some shadowy military-corporate-executive thing says no, no, no!
[00:18:13.004 --> 00:18:22.890]  Yeah, I want to say that in the 1980s, the news stories... Oliver North was working on them at that time, and Oliver North was
[00:18:23.922 --> 00:18:25.163]  I think we're good to go.
[00:18:51.644 --> 00:18:52.885]  Which is a suspension!
[00:18:52.945 --> 00:18:54.045]  That is a suspension!
[00:18:54.366 --> 00:18:58.788]  That is prima facie saying, as under the Constitution, that Congress is co-equal.
[00:18:59.388 --> 00:19:01.489]  Well, particularly because Congress failed.
[00:19:01.869 --> 00:19:09.113]  If Congress had done something about it, maybe we could have got things back on a more level keel and back to normal.
[00:19:09.173 --> 00:19:16.757]  But so far, Congress has done nothing about this challenge to its authority, and that's very discouraging for me.
[00:19:17.535 --> 00:19:17.916]  It is.
[00:19:19.017 --> 00:19:33.952]  Well, I've reverse-engineered a lot of what COG's doing, just from interviewing local police chiefs, you know, where the rubber meets the roads, where you pick up the most intelligence, and for at least 30 years, I discovered it 10 years ago, they go to every major police chief,
[00:19:34.833 --> 00:19:37.395]  And special forces, CIA, Delta Force.
[00:19:37.896 --> 00:19:39.337]  And it's always over something innocuous.
[00:19:39.357 --> 00:19:40.218]  They corrupt them.
[00:19:40.618 --> 00:19:43.601]  And they say, here's a hundred thousand dollars if you just do me this little favor.
[00:19:44.161 --> 00:19:48.325]  And they'll go, well that's a little bitty favor, just calling the fire chief and asking him to let you do something in an old building.
[00:19:48.845 --> 00:19:49.886]  We just want to be your friend.
[00:19:49.926 --> 00:19:50.827]  Take the hundred grand.
[00:19:51.928 --> 00:19:55.551]  And that's how they, I mean, so that's just one little window in.
[00:19:55.731 --> 00:20:01.036]  Or in the late eighties, they were doing gun confiscation raids using Marines in police uniforms.
[00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:16.723]  Or we learned almost three years ago, and it came out in mainstream news a year after I reported it, we got the secret FEMA documents where they recruited 26,000 preachers to give their flock sermons written by FEMA about going to camps, giving up your guns, Romans 13.
[00:20:17.843 --> 00:20:20.684]  So what I'm saying is, on the ground, it's everywhere.
[00:20:20.744 --> 00:20:29.666]  I mean, they are working like busy bees, not just with Hollywood scripts or TV propaganda, but I mean, they're everywhere engaging in hardcore criminal activity.
[00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:38.517]  Well, some of what you talked about actually antedates this current COG planning that I'm talking about.
[00:20:39.617 --> 00:20:50.326]  The current phase of it began in the second year of the Reagan presidency, when Cheney and Rumsfeld were empowered to plan it, and they planned it for 20 years.
[00:20:50.446 --> 00:20:55.070]  But before that, there were older programs, and one of them, of course, was the
[00:20:55.598 --> 00:21:19.629]  The CIA, which is supposed to work overseas and have no domestic security assignments, but in fact has worked very closely with police departments, some more than others, but a great many of them, and recruiting police to serve overseas for the CIA.
[00:21:20.069 --> 00:21:24.891]  So there's a great deal going on that we only get little glimpses of.
[00:21:25.427 --> 00:21:27.268]  But you've interviewed people.
[00:21:27.328 --> 00:21:32.429]  What I've done is just work with documents and news stories.
[00:21:32.769 --> 00:21:42.012]  And what I see as being the core of the COG planning under Brunsfield and Cheney has three elements.
[00:21:42.032 --> 00:21:43.913]  The first one is... Stay there.
[00:21:44.013 --> 00:21:44.593]  Gotta break.
[00:21:44.633 --> 00:21:45.113]  Gotta break.
[00:21:45.153 --> 00:21:46.234]  Yeah, there's an expansion.
[00:21:47.234 --> 00:21:48.854]  Let's get your analysis on that.
[00:21:48.914 --> 00:21:49.795]  Long segment coming up.
[00:21:50.735 --> 00:21:51.655]  We're on the march.
[00:21:52.135 --> 00:21:53.636]  The empire's on the run.

[00:22:00.803 --> 00:22:04.285]  The pressures of everyday life can deliver a serious blow to your health.
[00:22:04.545 --> 00:22:09.988]  Stress increases blood pressure, potential heart problems, strokes, ulcers, depression, and insomnia.
[00:22:10.189 --> 00:22:13.190]  Stress suppresses your immune system and inhibits weight control.
[00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:15.952]  Stress makes you nervous, anxious, or irritable.
[00:22:16.132 --> 00:22:19.254]  Introducing Nature's Renewal Supreme Anti-Stress Formula.
[00:22:19.434 --> 00:22:24.797]  When you're stressed out or need to ease nervousness, our Supreme Anti-Stress Formula calms simple nervous tension.
[00:22:24.957 --> 00:22:25.337]  I think so.
[00:22:42.665 --> 00:22:47.927]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:22:48.147 --> 00:22:50.027]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:23:10.106 --> 00:23:11.127]  But who is the enemy?
[00:23:11.627 --> 00:23:12.147]  Bin Laden.
[00:23:12.447 --> 00:23:13.428]  This is his M.O.
[00:23:13.448 --> 00:23:14.729]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:23:14.769 --> 00:23:16.450]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:23.554]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:23:23.954 --> 00:23:24.394]  Some U.S.
[00:23:24.434 --> 00:23:30.098]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:23:30.778 --> 00:23:34.301]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:23:34.661 --> 00:23:44.528]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:23:44.748 --> 00:23:45.489]  Fabled Enemies.

[00:23:53.754 --> 00:23:57.097]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:03.661]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[00:24:04.261 --> 00:24:06.342]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[00:24:06.682 --> 00:24:09.763]  Tonight, I have a date with the very lovely Rachel.
[00:24:10.164 --> 00:24:19.347]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston, online, from my desk, with Webex.
[00:24:19.947 --> 00:24:23.091]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[00:24:23.311 --> 00:24:28.057]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[00:24:28.177 --> 00:24:31.882]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[00:24:33.084 --> 00:24:39.286]  Travel less, meet online with Webex for as little as $59 a month, about the price of a tank of gas.
[00:24:39.586 --> 00:24:42.407]  You can host unlimited meetings every month from your desktop.
[00:24:42.827 --> 00:24:46.589]  Webex from Cisco, used by more than 7 million people every month.
[00:24:46.689 --> 00:24:49.770]  Give it a try, free, and qualify for a free webcam.

[00:24:56.852 --> 00:25:04.314]  You see, when you see the Congress, you see the Senators, the Governors, they're not in control anymore.
[00:25:04.354 --> 00:25:09.716]  But in case they ever try to take their rightful authority of the people,
[00:25:23.629 --> 00:25:24.349]  Through the people.
[00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:25.891]  They're being bypassed.
[00:25:25.951 --> 00:25:27.352]  Secret prisons are being built.
[00:25:27.432 --> 00:25:29.073]  Assassins are being put in every city.
[00:25:29.373 --> 00:25:32.915]  The CIA is moving into emergency management centers with local police.
[00:25:32.935 --> 00:25:37.879]  They're hiring police as hitmen so they can kill people like Carnaby down in Houston when they need it.
[00:25:37.899 --> 00:25:40.760]  I mean, they mean business.
[00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:43.761]  And they're getting ready for something really big.
[00:25:43.841 --> 00:25:54.325]  Why are they gearing up when the public's already, they're slaves, don't even know what continent they're on, don't even know they're on a planet, half of them don't even know, some people don't, most kids now don't know the sun sets and the world's round.
[00:25:54.665 --> 00:25:56.325]  Total disconnection from reality.
[00:25:56.745 --> 00:26:00.367]  Why then is the COG, the social engineers, so worried?
[00:26:00.747 --> 00:26:03.108]  We'll talk to Peter Del Scott about that in just a few minutes.
[00:26:04.042 --> 00:26:09.667]  First off, a Cola Blue is a wonderful atmospheric water generator for your home.
[00:26:09.727 --> 00:26:12.890]  Pays for itself in one year if you buy your water from the store.
[00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:14.692]  Pure, clean water without the fluoride.
[00:26:15.193 --> 00:26:17.054]  Ultimate water from the humidity and the air.
[00:26:17.955 --> 00:26:19.236]  Knows exactly what you're drinking.
[00:26:19.276 --> 00:26:22.940]  Machine produces up to 28 liters of water in 24 hours or 7.5 gallons.
[00:26:23.581 --> 00:26:26.744]  Produces about two and a half, three gallons even in the really dry desert.
[00:26:27.464 --> 00:26:27.804]  I think so.
[00:26:44.536 --> 00:26:51.861]  866-585-4044, 866-585-4044, or acolablue.com, acolablue.com.
[00:26:52.301 --> 00:26:55.963]  And that is one of the great sponsors that makes so much of this radio show possible.
[00:26:56.384 --> 00:26:57.604]  Alright, I've been jumping in.
[00:26:57.784 --> 00:27:01.467]  I always want to get Peter Del Scott on and not interrupt, but I want to back up everything he's saying.
[00:27:01.527 --> 00:27:03.428]  I want to add pieces of info.
[00:27:04.068 --> 00:27:05.709]  I want to, and he knows so much.
[00:27:07.284 --> 00:27:13.167]  Getting more into COG, and we know now it's told Congress, you're nothing, even though Congress is co-equal.
[00:27:13.507 --> 00:27:15.308]  Really, the founders said it was above the executive.
[00:27:15.348 --> 00:27:17.769]  It makes the laws and the executive executes.
[00:27:18.289 --> 00:27:21.911]  I mean, that is a constitutional crisis, but it just goes forward.
[00:27:21.931 --> 00:27:23.672]  We know the NSA is spying on Congress.
[00:27:23.732 --> 00:27:26.513]  I just had Wayne Madsen on about that last hour.
[00:27:27.113 --> 00:27:28.594]  We know they're really gearing up.
[00:27:28.634 --> 00:27:29.854]  There's a huge build-up.
[00:27:30.635 --> 00:27:33.096]  So just whatever you think is most important on this subject, Peter.
[00:27:34.232 --> 00:27:45.819]  Well, I'm going to, first of all, dispel the illusion that I know what COG is doing, because I'm quite sure of what I do know, but it's also quite limited.
[00:27:46.919 --> 00:28:01.268]  What I know about COG is based on reports from the 1980s, when it was the same planning, only with Oliver North, and there are three major ingredients of it, of which the third is the most important.
[00:28:02.172 --> 00:28:10.956]  The first is warrantless surveillance, and we've now seen this embodied into law, really, with the amendments to the FISA Act.
[00:28:11.856 --> 00:28:14.157]  And the second is warrantless detention.
[00:28:14.837 --> 00:28:29.923]  And, you know, I wrote a news story a couple of years back about a $400 million contract to KBR, which was, back in those days, still a subsidiary of Cheney's old corporation Halliburton.
[00:28:30.824 --> 00:28:45.167]  To build detention camps as part of what the Homeland Security Department said on their website was a 10-year project endgame to deal with the problem of illegal immigrants in this country.
[00:28:45.247 --> 00:28:46.507]  That's how they described it.
[00:28:47.008 --> 00:28:53.569]  But when you consider that there are almost 12 million illegal immigrants in this country, it's obviously a very ambitious
[00:28:54.455 --> 00:29:01.198]  Uh, program of which this $400 million budget was only for one stage of the program.
[00:29:01.698 --> 00:29:19.404]  The third and the most important part, which, uh, has been planning, uh, for some time, how to get around the Posse Comitatus Act and, uh, normalized conditions of, uh, martial law, military operations in this country.
[00:29:19.504 --> 00:29:23.586]  And some very significant steps have now been taken publicly
[00:29:24.102 --> 00:29:27.284]  In that respect, we are now a military district.
[00:29:27.324 --> 00:29:32.006]  We have a NORTHCOM for the United States, just as the U.S.
[00:29:32.086 --> 00:29:35.068]  Army has a SOUTHCOM to deal with South America.
[00:29:35.948 --> 00:29:50.676]  And when we had the Katrina hurricane, the federal government tried very hard to get Governor Blanco of Louisiana to allow them to take over and federalize the National Guard.
[00:29:50.696 --> 00:29:51.496]  She resisted.
[00:29:52.065 --> 00:29:59.728]  But I think that maybe in the future they're just going to take that power, not by asking.
[00:29:59.868 --> 00:30:12.513]  Hey, to interrupt, John Warner Defense Authorization Act 1997 said that, and said that for insurrection, for rebellion, for governors rebelling, it states the president is basically a dictator.
[00:30:12.553 --> 00:30:14.934]  So I know that you knew that, but for the audience.
[00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:35.700]  And one of the things about this last proclamation of extending the emergency was that Bush has now taken the responsibility for that right inside the White House, so it isn't even in the hands of Homeland Security and FEMA anymore.
[00:30:37.041 --> 00:30:44.786]  Its direction comes centrally from this kind of inner bureaucracy inside the bureaucracy.
[00:30:45.299 --> 00:30:58.543]  And that's when I talk about the deep state, I'm talking about all of these ways in which a regular government which has a certain degree of openness to it
[00:30:59.036 --> 00:31:05.121]  is being supplanted by special arrangements which are secret and which we cannot see the details of.
[00:31:05.481 --> 00:31:16.610]  But doesn't that say the fact that they take over 25 agencies in dealing with intelligence and law enforcement and security, put it into Homeland Security, but then Bush doesn't even trust that?
[00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:24.892]  The executive drags it in even closer to a tiny eye of authority, and then he's got all the cronies and special interests behind him.
[00:31:24.912 --> 00:31:32.235]  I mean, that shows to me, and we've also seen in the news, that that is a byproduct of resistance within the bureaucracy.
[00:31:33.155 --> 00:31:46.819]  I suspect that the real center of power there is going to be the vice president's office, because one of the changes since 9-11 has been the expansion of the vice president's office into a kind of
[00:31:47.774 --> 00:31:49.475]  Oh, you were listening earlier.
[00:31:49.495 --> 00:31:50.136]  I'm flattered.
[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:22.224]  No, I didn't hear the first hour, but I think you made a quick reference to it when you were talking about the first hour.
[00:32:22.424 --> 00:32:23.264]  Okay.
[00:32:23.304 --> 00:32:25.585]  Yes, this is extremely important.
[00:32:25.946 --> 00:32:45.176]  When we have Blackwater, in a sense, conducting warfare overseas, and not only that, but you know Blackwater was armed and in the streets of New Orleans after Katrina, certainly Congress never had any say in that that I know of.
[00:32:46.045 --> 00:32:53.948]  And then you've got the surveillance of Americans being entrusted to private corporations.
[00:32:54.449 --> 00:33:07.334]  There's a real conflict of interest here and there because it's in their interest to magnify the perceived threat to government so that they can magnify their budget to go on surveilling us.
[00:33:07.414 --> 00:33:11.816]  And Alex, I imagine that they listen to your phone and mine and they aren't even the government.
[00:33:12.526 --> 00:33:14.087]  And they make money out of it!
[00:33:14.427 --> 00:33:15.447]  Yeah, for profit.
[00:33:15.647 --> 00:33:17.648]  They are for-profit corporations.
[00:33:18.428 --> 00:33:39.095]  And, again, I am so disappointed that Congress is being very lethargic in dealing with these very rapid changes, which are... You see, what really counts at bottom of all this is that there are some people who feel that America should run an empire
[00:33:40.007 --> 00:33:44.208]  Uh, in every continent of the world and have, uh, U.S.
[00:33:44.228 --> 00:33:49.609]  troops in places like Georgia and Kyrgyzstan, which is on the Chinese border.
[00:33:50.490 --> 00:34:00.912]  Uh, and, uh, you know, if there was democratic discussion of this, I think, uh, saner voices would establish that this is not in our interest.
[00:34:01.012 --> 00:34:09.334]  I mean, what's happened in Georgia in the last, uh, month is a clear illustration of the madness, the insanity
[00:34:10.152 --> 00:34:10.773]  Yes, I think so.
[00:34:31.164 --> 00:34:37.571]  You've ultimately got to contain and curtail the forces of democracy in our own country.
[00:34:51.806 --> 00:35:01.054]  And the orders we know have gone out, it's even come out in New York, to squeeze and boss and push and to not be like servants, and to let the public know the government's the boss.
[00:35:01.114 --> 00:35:11.542]  And I've been in D.C., New York, other places, but also in London, and you'll just watch the police walk over rudely to a crowd in the middle of a park doing nothing and just yell at them like they're scum.
[00:35:12.463 --> 00:35:14.805]  And so, so, so that order has gone out.
[00:35:16.187 --> 00:35:23.730]  And I know you just covered scientifically what you can, from a sociological perspective, cover, but you can see it.
[00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:34.434]  They're gearing up for something big, and the indigenous populations of the empire, the Imperium, Oceania, and of course North America, some parts of Europe, is the main target.
[00:35:34.914 --> 00:35:41.357]  And there's this larger global deep state putting in the same control grids, the same surveillance, the same biometrics,
[00:35:42.017 --> 00:35:45.980]  I'm not as apocalyptic about this as you are Alex because I've lived in many countries and it's still true
[00:36:03.962 --> 00:36:08.305]  of America as it was when I first came here in 1961.
[00:36:08.666 --> 00:36:18.432]  It may not be quite as true now as it was then, but this is still basically a country that I feel more secure in vis-a-vis the police.
[00:36:18.492 --> 00:36:18.873]  No, no, no.
[00:36:18.993 --> 00:36:19.813]  I agree with you.
[00:36:19.853 --> 00:36:21.474]  What I'm saying is the direction it's going.
[00:36:21.514 --> 00:36:21.895]  Okay, listen.
[00:36:22.415 --> 00:36:32.102]  It's apocalyptic to me that the majority of narcotics are shipped in here by government-approved groups and the people they go attack or raid overseas
[00:36:32.802 --> 00:36:35.303]  Or down south are the cartels that don't play ball.
[00:36:35.723 --> 00:36:40.825]  I mean, that's apocalyptic, to have them putting people in prison for drugs they shipped in.
[00:36:41.225 --> 00:36:45.786]  It's apocalyptic to me to have them sneak attacking Russia two weeks ago.
[00:36:45.846 --> 00:36:49.267]  I mean, a million-two dead Iraqis is apocalyptic.
[00:36:49.387 --> 00:36:56.450]  And they admitted in the Houston Chronicle that those FEMA camps were also for American citizens, too.
[00:36:57.330 --> 00:37:02.752]  And, I mean, I agree that we've still got a lot of good left in this country, and that other nations are bad or worse.
[00:37:02.832 --> 00:37:04.712]  I'm saying, I was saying, it's global.
[00:37:05.612 --> 00:37:11.774]  Well, you know, if you go back, the first big plan for massive detention was Oliver North.
[00:37:12.814 --> 00:37:20.456]  And Oliver North, he ran into opposition from Reagan's own Attorney General.
[00:37:20.897 --> 00:37:25.778]  Now, it's true that that Attorney General then quickly resigned, and another one came,
[00:37:26.485 --> 00:37:37.497]  But the North's plans were put on hold, and Congress's role there is very iffy.
[00:37:37.577 --> 00:37:42.823]  On the one hand, North was asked about this in the Iran-Contra hearings.
[00:37:42.943 --> 00:37:47.428]  Is it true you're planning for the suspension of the American Constitution?
[00:37:48.126 --> 00:38:02.024]  And the amazing response of the chairman, who was a Democrat, Senator Inouye, and by the way, basically a fairly decent senator, but his response was, if we're going to talk about that, we have to go into a secret session.
[00:38:02.044 --> 00:38:07.010]  So he, in a sense, was protecting the secret system.
[00:38:08.122 --> 00:38:12.784]  Giving it priority over the importance of exposing it by the public.
[00:38:12.964 --> 00:38:15.205]  But then Congress was let in on it.
[00:38:15.325 --> 00:38:17.406]  Now they're not, which shows a major shift.
[00:38:17.986 --> 00:38:19.887]  I just don't know to what extent.
[00:38:19.967 --> 00:38:24.488]  I suspect that there are a few people who were let in in the intelligence committees.
[00:38:25.489 --> 00:38:32.972]  But again, all I know is that there is a problem and there is no, very little public response.
[00:38:33.032 --> 00:38:35.132]  And particularly in August of 2007,
[00:38:36.997 --> 00:38:54.040]  Congress should have said, the Homeland Security Committee has the right to see those things, and in not saying that, it was virtually acknowledging that we're in a new era where secret papers have taken priority over the American Constitution.
[00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:59.381]  Well, you say that you don't see it as apocalyptic as I see it.
[00:38:59.781 --> 00:39:00.941]  How do you see the future?
[00:39:00.981 --> 00:39:01.862]  Is it rosy?
[00:39:02.782 --> 00:39:04.302]  What do you see happening?
[00:39:05.751 --> 00:39:09.553]  Well, it depends which day of the week, Alex.
[00:39:11.613 --> 00:39:21.798]  Some days I am very pessimistic, but you know, I think it's healthy to have a powerful capacity for denial.
[00:39:22.578 --> 00:39:24.179]  That's what makes me write my books.
[00:39:24.959 --> 00:39:32.442]  As long as I can go on writing my books, and here's an even more important public thing, as long as the Internet is allowing us
[00:39:33.846 --> 00:39:38.387]  To discuss these things openly, then we are not in a fascist state.
[00:39:38.547 --> 00:39:46.889]  But you know now they're moving with a multi-headed Hydra, openly saying they want to shut down what we know is the web today, with a cocktail of attacks.
[00:39:47.289 --> 00:40:01.493]  That's quite true that there are some people who want to do this, but the nice thing about this litmus test for our society is that if that does happen, if they shut it down, and we can't communicate with each other, we at least will know it.
[00:40:01.963 --> 00:40:09.466]  Now you might say that's when it's too late and you can fold your tents, but it's not too late at present.
[00:40:09.646 --> 00:40:15.048]  I think that the real test ultimately is going to be how much do the American people care?
[00:40:15.628 --> 00:40:29.193]  You care, and I care, and there are really thousands of people who care, but then there are millions of people who don't care, and the question is whether we can reach those millions, or enough of them, to create
[00:40:30.609 --> 00:40:31.550]  I don't know.
[00:40:46.024 --> 00:40:49.806]  The candidates in their district, what is their position on CO2?
[00:40:49.826 --> 00:40:50.846]  Make it a big issue!
[00:40:50.866 --> 00:40:52.407]  I totally agree with you.
[00:40:52.587 --> 00:40:53.248]  Excellent point.
[00:40:53.968 --> 00:41:13.458]  And this is where, you know, every now and then the American people are part of the system and between now and November they have the power to ask these questions and to punish the candidates who refuse to take a strong position against the super
[00:41:14.722 --> 00:41:19.104]  The overriding of the Constitution by a set of secret orders.
[00:41:19.464 --> 00:41:20.965]  Peter Del Scott is our guest.
[00:41:21.345 --> 00:41:23.786]  Peter, I'm going to skip this break for the network.
[00:41:25.067 --> 00:41:33.451]  In the InfoWars.com stream, you'll be able to hear this little final three-minute segment with Peter, and we'll come back in the final segment for the full audience here in just a moment.
[00:41:33.511 --> 00:41:35.051]  But before we go to this break,
[00:41:36.272 --> 00:41:38.954]  Okay, are we saying goodbye at this point?
[00:42:04.958 --> 00:42:19.101]  And so, if you're inviting me to say, first of all, I want to repeat that my website is www.peterdalescott.net, where I have a lot more about these things, but you can just Google for me.
[00:42:19.721 --> 00:42:23.822]  If you Google for Peter Dale Scott, the first thing that comes up is my website.
[00:42:24.382 --> 00:42:30.363]  Now, in my newest book, The War Conspiracy, first of all, in the road to 9-11,
[00:42:32.374 --> 00:42:46.164]  I lay out the conditions under which COG planning has gone on for 20 years, and how it was instituted on September the 11th.
[00:42:46.304 --> 00:42:54.030]  A lot of people who are studying 9-11 are not aware that the chief political consequence of it was COG.
[00:42:54.250 --> 00:42:55.411]  And this is absolutely key.
[00:42:55.431 --> 00:42:59.694]  We're going to keep talking about it right now, exclusively, for InfoWars.com listeners.
[00:43:00.882 --> 00:43:02.223]  Peter, please continue.
[00:43:02.263 --> 00:43:09.005]  We're just on the internet feed right now, but it's hundreds of thousands listening for free and over 10,000 watching.
[00:43:09.185 --> 00:43:11.886]  Now I understand.
[00:43:11.966 --> 00:43:17.429]  And that's what I should have you back up about for a full hour without getting into... You're right.
[00:43:17.469 --> 00:43:18.489]  It was implemented then.
[00:43:18.749 --> 00:43:20.470]  We are currently under COG.
[00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:21.370]  Explain that to people.
[00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:26.012]  I've only had two favorable reviews of both of them.
[00:43:26.434 --> 00:43:41.559]  Didn't believe me when I said it, but it's an absolute matter of fact, and it's said twice in the 9-11 report that it was instituted, and that we can even time it to shortly before 10 o'clock on the morning of September the 11th.
[00:43:41.579 --> 00:43:46.640]  And we know the five big aircraft that run it, the doomsday planes, were flying around.
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:49.481]  Yes, give us the proof, the facts, that it was implemented.
[00:43:49.935 --> 00:43:55.256]  Well, no, I'd rather talk a bit about my... because I've really sort of shot my bolt on that, you know.
[00:43:55.276 --> 00:44:04.798]  I have many other things to say in the road to 9-11, but my knowledge about what happened on that day is contained in two chapters.
[00:44:04.838 --> 00:44:08.519]  No, but I meant specifically about the Continental Government being implemented.
[00:44:08.539 --> 00:44:12.920]  Well, there was a three-part order
[00:44:14.382 --> 00:44:21.885]  Richard Clarke talks about it in his book, Against All Enemies, but the 9-11 report echoes him on this.
[00:44:22.425 --> 00:44:28.947]  There was an order, the first part is innocuous, which was to provide fighter escort for the President's plane.
[00:44:29.867 --> 00:44:42.591]  The second one was, the important thing was that the second one was to implement COG, and so there's no doubting that it happened.
[00:44:43.024 --> 00:45:05.323]  If I could say a word about my other book, The War Conspiracy, a lot of it's about Vietnam and is historical, but the end of it is about disturbing similarities between the assassination of President Kennedy and the way in which 9-11 was instituted.
[00:45:05.503 --> 00:45:08.506]  And I talk about designated suspects.
[00:45:08.646 --> 00:45:11.328]  I say that Oswald was a designated suspect
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:27.308]  Because the CIA had been doing something with him, and whoever was responsible for the Kennedy assassination knew that there would not be a proper investigation because of the intelligence involvement with Oswald.
[00:45:27.769 --> 00:45:29.229]  And the same is true of 9-11.
[00:45:29.289 --> 00:45:39.735]  Now, I'm telescoping a great many similarities, but a key one is that at least two, and probably more, of the alleged assassins
[00:45:40.843 --> 00:46:00.490]  I mean, hijackers were of interest, of such interest to the CIA that in both cases, both Oswald in 1963 and Al-Nadar and al-Hazmi in 2000, information that CIA ought to have given to the FBI, they didn't give.
[00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:03.211]  Stay there, stay there, we're coming back to the full audience.
[00:46:03.251 --> 00:46:04.531]  I've got to have you back in the near future.
[00:46:04.591 --> 00:46:04.891]  Here we go.
[00:46:11.519 --> 00:46:16.866]  Wow, I gotta have Peter Del Scott back soon for another hour just to get into his war conspiracy book.
[00:46:16.886 --> 00:46:23.394]  He was talking about similarities between the way they ran the JFK assassination and the way the black ops ran 9-11.
[00:46:23.494 --> 00:46:28.841]  All those tell-tale signs, the cover-ups, the activities, the supposed assassin, the hijackers.
[00:46:30.663 --> 00:46:33.046]  Springman, you know, the head of the Visa section.
[00:46:33.086 --> 00:46:34.307]  He's in our new film, Fabled Enemies.
[00:46:34.607 --> 00:46:35.548]  You can pre-order right now.
[00:46:35.568 --> 00:46:36.850]  It comes out in about a week and a half.
[00:46:38.291 --> 00:46:39.913]  Again, at InfoWars.com.
[00:46:40.353 --> 00:46:42.536]  You have Springman right there, and he's going, I'm not letting him in there.
[00:46:42.556 --> 00:46:43.336]  They're listed as terrorists.
[00:46:43.356 --> 00:46:44.197]  And he's told, no, no, no, no.
[00:46:44.998 --> 00:46:47.959]  That's a cover for their national security jobs.
[00:46:48.399 --> 00:46:50.480]  You know, this is CIA, let them in.
[00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:58.862]  I mean, and trained at the defense bases, and in spy training, and that's all admitted, and the government just says, well, we're not going to talk about that.
[00:46:59.482 --> 00:47:01.263]  And boy, I've got to read your two new books.
[00:47:01.363 --> 00:47:09.685]  I read one of your books, it must have been ten years ago, you know, just about the government shipping and the drugs, and then I read it.
[00:47:09.706 --> 00:47:14.427]  I mean, you've written so many books, but these two new ones, folks can go to your website and get them, can't they?
[00:47:15.598 --> 00:47:16.058]  That's right.
[00:47:35.148 --> 00:47:35.968]  So thank you, Alex.
[00:47:35.988 --> 00:47:38.349]  I'm on the road myself quite a lot in the next month.
[00:47:38.409 --> 00:47:40.749]  I'm going to Canada at the end of this month and going back to Canada
[00:48:04.778 --> 00:48:07.599]  to read poetry in the middle of September.
[00:48:08.119 --> 00:48:11.061]  So, he can phone me and we'll see what we can work out.
[00:48:11.081 --> 00:48:19.984]  Yeah, let me have my producer call you and just set you up sometime in the next two weeks, either on the show when I'm here or with Jason Burnham next week, because an hour with the breaks isn't enough time.
[00:48:20.284 --> 00:48:21.885]  Peter Del Scott, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:48:22.225 --> 00:48:23.106]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[00:48:23.886 --> 00:48:24.686]  What a great gentleman.
[00:48:24.766 --> 00:48:26.987]  What depth and breadth of knowledge.
[00:48:27.007 --> 00:48:29.548]  We'll have to pick his brain more here in the near future.
[00:48:29.588 --> 00:48:33.510]  Folks, we had Ron Paul on at the first of the show, early in the show today.
[00:48:34.838 --> 00:48:44.662]  And we had Paul Watson with Big Breaking News on, we also had Jonathan Elinoff, and then Wayne Madsen, and then of course Peter Del Scott, you just heard for the last 50 minutes or so.
[00:48:45.522 --> 00:48:49.564]  That rebroadcast will start in about three minutes at one place on the internet.
[00:48:50.004 --> 00:48:53.205]  I love our Aminath and Medial, that's where we reach 90% of the people.
[00:48:53.565 --> 00:49:03.429]  Shortwave's wonderful, but the good part about InfoWars.com and the free podcast as well, but the restreaming, is that you can listen how you want, when you want, so if you missed any
[00:49:06.784 --> 00:49:14.834]  Of the first hour, second hour, Ron Paul with just incredible info on Georgia, his wife, Carol, on the rally that's coming up.
[00:49:14.894 --> 00:49:15.575]  Will he be there?
[00:49:15.615 --> 00:49:16.676]  You'll find out on the show.
[00:49:17.137 --> 00:49:19.460]  Coming up right now at InfoWars.com.
[00:49:20.141 --> 00:49:22.103]  Don't forget, Fabled Enemies is coming out.
[00:49:23.792 --> 00:49:25.032]  I'm just too proud of this film.
[00:49:25.112 --> 00:49:26.313]  I want it to be a huge success.
[00:49:26.893 --> 00:49:27.893]  I want people to see this.
[00:49:28.253 --> 00:49:30.773]  We've also taken a bold risk putting this out.
[00:49:30.793 --> 00:49:31.934]  This film is controversial.
[00:49:31.954 --> 00:49:41.836]  You'll be able to see it at PrisonPlanet.tv on September 1st, a few hours early, wink wink, I'll put it out on the 31st, at PrisonPlanet.tv for members there.
[00:49:42.276 --> 00:49:46.176]  And you can order the DVD right now and have it shipped out to you first, September 1st.
[00:49:46.536 --> 00:49:48.657]  We'll have all those prepackaged, ready to go, September 1st.
[00:49:49.557 --> 00:49:53.579]  UPS ground, take about three days on average in the United States to get that.
[00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:58.402]  And then in closing, Interfood, our wonderful folks, they make the show possible.
[00:49:58.422 --> 00:49:59.823]  Don't forget interfood.com.

[00:50:06.547 --> 00:50:07.848]  They make so much of what we do possible.
[00:50:08.148 --> 00:50:09.709]  They're a wonderful storable food company.
[00:50:09.729 --> 00:50:11.010]  It's where I got a lot of my food.
