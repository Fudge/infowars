[00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:00.469]  I don't know.
[00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.868]  Folks, we're talking to Ted Nugent, who's touring the country right now.
[00:00:17.428 --> 00:00:20.470]  Ted, you look, I mean, I've had you on a couple times over the years.
[00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.794]  I think the first time I interviewed you was, I think, eight years ago, and then about five years ago.
[00:00:24.814 --> 00:00:26.675]  So it's been about five years since you've joined us.
[00:00:27.335 --> 00:00:28.436]  And I totally agree with you.
[00:00:28.496 --> 00:00:29.837]  We don't need open borders.
[00:00:29.877 --> 00:00:30.978]  We don't need gun control.
[00:00:31.018 --> 00:00:33.320]  We need more liberty, not less liberty.
[00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.142]  We need to legalize freedom, like Ron Paul has said.
[00:00:36.262 --> 00:00:42.887]  But, I mean, we have the Republican Party that's tripled the size of government the last eight years.
[00:00:43.747 --> 00:00:47.932]  George Bush said that he would sign the assault weapons ban if it got to his desk.
[00:00:47.972 --> 00:00:49.354]  Thank God it didn't.
[00:00:49.394 --> 00:00:58.664]  So my whole point is, how do we awaken the people that both parties are sold out to interests that don't want us to have freedom?
[00:00:59.385 --> 00:01:03.350]  Well, Alex, God bless you for using your megaphone.
[00:01:03.786 --> 00:01:04.166]  I don't think so.
[00:01:15.905 --> 00:01:28.653]  Because as a participating, we the people, experimenter in self-government, I believe it is our moral and spiritual obligation to be involved, to be outspoken, to blow those whistles.
[00:01:28.693 --> 00:01:29.634]  And here's the answer.
[00:01:30.014 --> 00:01:38.860]  The simple answer is outlined lick for lick in a brand new book I'm just wrapping up right now for Regnery Publishing called Ted White and Blue, The Nugent Manifesto.
[00:01:39.661 --> 00:01:42.883]  And we need to, and not the scourge of liberalism in this country,
[00:01:43.413 --> 00:01:45.055]  But the scourge of apathy.
[00:01:45.575 --> 00:01:52.682]  And yes, I have many blood brothers that are hardcore, rugged individuals in the great Republic of Texas.
[00:01:52.962 --> 00:02:02.752]  But if you look around you in our home state of Texas, Alex, or Illinois, or Massachusetts, literally every state, the enemy isn't the liberals.
[00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:11.042]  The enemy is those of us who know and live logic every day, but don't do a damn thing about it.
[00:02:11.082 --> 00:02:22.151]  The curse in America is apathy, and we need to communicate with our friends at work, at school, at church, at the barbecue pit, at the bowling alley, at the shooting range.
[00:02:22.431 --> 00:02:27.375]  We need to communicate and prod specific issues, and I think it should start with gun control.
[00:02:27.815 --> 00:02:30.838]  It should go to taxes and education, upgrade and reform.
[00:02:31.238 --> 00:02:42.724]  Welfare reform, but we need to get these logical lifestyles by the most productive American families, those that have an alarm clock and bust their ass to be the best that they can be.
[00:02:43.065 --> 00:02:53.410]  We need to find that extra time like the Nugent family does, and let our Senator, our Congressman, our State Rep, our Governor, our Mayor, and the White House know exactly what we expect.
[00:02:53.751 --> 00:02:59.934]  For example, those two heroic border agents who are in jail right now, Compione and Ramos,
[00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:05.187]  They should be exonerated and they should be pardoned tonight.
[00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:13.270]  And every American should be pounding our own bully pulpit and demand that these heroes of law enforcement and border security
[00:03:13.832 --> 00:03:16.915]  are exonerated and let out of prison immediately.
[00:03:16.955 --> 00:03:18.316]  That's just one example.
[00:03:18.416 --> 00:03:18.856]  Yes it is.
[00:03:18.916 --> 00:03:26.563]  Ted, we're talking to Ted Nugent right now, author, best-selling author, TV host, filmmaker, and of course, rock star.
[00:03:27.343 --> 00:03:28.224]  Ted, do me a favor.
[00:03:28.244 --> 00:03:29.325]  You say your voice isn't strong.
[00:03:29.385 --> 00:03:30.106]  It's super strong.
[00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:31.967]  Can you back off your cell phone there a little bit?
[00:03:32.308 --> 00:03:33.448]  I can try a little bit, yes, sir.
[00:03:33.468 --> 00:03:34.509]  I get a little passionate.
[00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.974]  And what I was articulating, if I may just for a moment here, Alex, I'm just a guitar player.
[00:03:40.698 --> 00:03:48.884]  I lead a simple life, I'm intense, and I have a lot of energy because I've taken good care of myself, and I have many, many dreams, even at the tender age of 60.
[00:03:50.104 --> 00:04:04.214]  But what I have discovered, and what I've outlined in Ted White and Blue, this new book I've written, is that the Nugent family does not experience any of the problems that are plaguing America today, if I may specify.
[00:04:05.077 --> 00:04:07.779]  We don't have welfare in the Nugent House.
[00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:09.561]  We wouldn't allow it.
[00:04:09.621 --> 00:04:19.788]  We wouldn't allow a handout into the Nugent House because we bust our ass to be the best that we can be and we are driven to be productive.
[00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.912]  We don't need border security on our property.
[00:04:24.352 --> 00:04:27.975]  No one invades our property because we've sent out a message.
[00:04:28.515 --> 00:04:32.138]  If you look like you're going to invade our property, we will shoot you.
[00:04:33.141 --> 00:04:47.805]  I could go on and on, but we don't need education money thrown at us, because when we see a misspelling, or the misspoken word, or bad hygiene, our loving family intervenes and we educate ourselves and our loved ones and our friends.
[00:04:48.685 --> 00:04:53.366]  This is the gist of the problem in America today, that it's all self-inflicted.
[00:04:53.926 --> 00:04:57.567]  Every problem, from the deficit to the welfare horror,
[00:04:58.633 --> 00:05:08.799]  Ted, I agree with you, but the biggest problem we've seen in the last eight years is that conservatives did go to sleep
[00:05:16.323 --> 00:05:20.569]  Did have apathy thinking George Bush has saved us from the monster Bill Clinton.
[00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:22.371]  Everything is okay now.
[00:05:22.411 --> 00:05:24.594]  We can just go quietly into the night.
[00:05:24.654 --> 00:05:26.576]  Meanwhile, our currency's been devalued.
[00:05:26.897 --> 00:05:29.620]  The government, as I said earlier, has tripled in size.
[00:05:29.681 --> 00:05:34.186]  And so what I see is I see real conservatives and libertarians being co-opted
[00:05:34.847 --> 00:05:40.109]  By the Republican Party, and of course if we had real leadership, that wouldn't have happened.
[00:05:40.489 --> 00:05:45.231]  And I know you're friends with a lot of these big-wig Republicans, and loyalty is something.
[00:05:45.651 --> 00:05:55.514]  But if people like Ted Nugent, I know you have spoken out some, really started going after the wolves in sheep's clothing that we have, I think we would turn this around a lot quicker.
[00:05:55.554 --> 00:05:57.455]  In every poll, Americans actually want
[00:05:57.955 --> 00:06:02.498]  True independence and liberty, but both parties won't give it to us.
[00:06:02.678 --> 00:06:09.882]  I mean, 91% of Americans want to control our borders in all the major polls and Gallup polls, but both parties won't give it to us.
[00:06:10.442 --> 00:06:12.243]  You're absolutely correct, Allison, believe me.
[00:06:12.784 --> 00:06:27.172]  In between all the responsibilities in my life as a father, as a husband, as a neighbor, as a productive American, I would challenge you to find anyone who is more involved, more communication, more gung-ho than
[00:06:27.577 --> 00:06:40.945]  This man you have on the phone right now, believe me, as I salute the Governor Perrys and the Mike Huckabees, as I salute those Republicans that are doing a good job, I scold them more often than I salute them.
[00:06:40.965 --> 00:06:44.366]  What did you think of the NAFTA highways and the Trans-Texas Corridor?
[00:06:44.667 --> 00:06:45.787]  I think it's an abomination.
[00:06:46.908 --> 00:06:49.009]  And the good Governor has heard from me on that.
[00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.451]  I pound my bully pulpit
[00:06:53.257 --> 00:06:54.437]  Every day.
[00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:57.378]  Well, maybe not opening day of deer season, but every other day.
[00:06:57.859 --> 00:06:59.519]  And maybe not every day during the rut.
[00:06:59.779 --> 00:07:09.742]  But Alex, I scream from every mountaintop I can that we the people, you know, I hang out with great ranchers and welders and plumbers and cops and teachers.
[00:07:09.762 --> 00:07:10.943]  You're out by Kerrville, right?
[00:07:11.443 --> 00:07:14.564]  Well, I live up in Waco and I hang out
[00:07:15.109 --> 00:07:18.191]  With Texans and Americans here, I'm in Iowa speaking to you.
[00:07:18.571 --> 00:07:19.791]  I was in South Dakota.
[00:07:20.132 --> 00:07:21.292]  I was up in Wisconsin.
[00:07:21.332 --> 00:07:22.593]  I'm traveling all over the nation.
[00:07:22.973 --> 00:07:27.195]  And I meet with wounded warriors, the heroes of the military, every day, Alex.
[00:07:27.656 --> 00:07:32.718]  And they are upset because they've sacrificed their legs and their arms for the U.S.
[00:07:32.798 --> 00:07:35.299]  Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the American Dream.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:43.684]  And they're upset that the Republican Party has turned into Fetzilla, a pig, a gluttonous, slovenly, indulgent,
[00:07:44.264 --> 00:07:45.485]  Ted Nugent, stay there.
[00:07:45.585 --> 00:07:49.067]  Quick break, I want to come back with you, the new book, Ted White & Blue.
[00:07:58.393 --> 00:08:01.375]  We're going to be back in about three minutes.
[00:08:01.635 --> 00:08:05.158]  ...because they've sacrificed their legs and their arms for the U.S.
[00:08:05.198 --> 00:08:16.846]  Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the American Dream, and they're upset that the Republican Party has turned into Fetzilla, a pig, a slovenly, indulgent pig.
[00:08:16.886 --> 00:08:17.966]  Ted Nugent, stay there.
[00:08:18.066 --> 00:08:18.487]  Quick break.
[00:08:18.527 --> 00:08:21.609]  I want to come back with you, the new book, The Ted White and Blue.
[00:08:23.507 --> 00:08:25.188]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:08:25.468 --> 00:08:28.910]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:30.971]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:08:31.391 --> 00:08:34.272]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:08:34.592 --> 00:08:40.055]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:08:40.315 --> 00:08:44.237]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:08:44.557 --> 00:08:49.479]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[00:08:49.759 --> 00:08:52.519]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:59.642]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded or streamed in super high quality directly to your computer or iPhone and shared with others.
[00:09:00.022 --> 00:09:05.844]  Thousands of special video reports, from tainted vaccines to martial law, can be found in this online video library.
[00:09:06.004 --> 00:09:10.505]  My weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[00:09:10.765 --> 00:09:13.328]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.
[00:09:13.688 --> 00:09:15.329]  Join PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:17.512]  Burn the info bombs to disk.
[00:09:17.732 --> 00:09:19.514]  Put them on the file sharing networks.
[00:09:19.854 --> 00:09:21.275]  Bring down the New World Order.
[00:09:21.636 --> 00:09:22.376]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:09:24.119 --> 00:09:27.460]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:32.482]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[00:09:32.922 --> 00:09:38.164]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[00:09:38.384 --> 00:09:48.908]  Though the people of the U.S., where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reigning them in and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[00:09:49.388 --> 00:09:49.908]  They are called...
[00:09:50.754 --> 00:09:56.917]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking with Ted Nugent, our final segment with him.
[00:09:56.937 --> 00:09:59.418]  I'm going to be skipping the next break so we can have as much time with him as possible.
[00:09:59.698 --> 00:10:04.280]  Last time I had you for an hour, Ted, we've got to have you back up for a full hour so we can take calls sometime.
[00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:05.420]  I'm all ears, Alex.
[00:10:05.461 --> 00:10:11.443]  I really appreciate the opportunity, and believe me, when I'm on the phone with you, I'm not representing the Nugent family alone.
[00:10:11.463 --> 00:10:20.147]  I'm representing families all across this great nation who are frustrated with the bureaucrats out there, and we need to upgrade this experiment in self-government as soon as possible.
[00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:21.850]  Absolutely.
[00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:26.473]  Ted, fire out some of your websites for the listeners out there, so they can check them out.
[00:10:26.853 --> 00:10:27.694]  Well, certainly, Alex.
[00:10:27.734 --> 00:10:29.856]  I would invite you to come to tednugent.com.
[00:10:29.876 --> 00:10:40.304]  We have a talkback, and I've got to tell you, you will never go to a website with more growing vital electric activism than you will find at tednugent.com talkback.
[00:10:40.808 --> 00:10:47.531]  I also write a weekly feature on humanevents.com and a weekly feature for the Waco Trib that you can find at wacotrib.com.
[00:10:47.871 --> 00:10:51.152]  But these are the kinds of activities that the Nugent family is involved with.
[00:10:51.512 --> 00:10:58.575]  And if you see the various television shows, I'm going to be on Anthony Bourdain shooting machine guns and cooking turkey here in the next couple of weeks.
[00:10:58.995 --> 00:11:05.721]  On A&E with Chris Angel doing an archery exhibition and talking about freedom and talking about rugged individualism.
[00:11:06.021 --> 00:11:09.804]  I'm going to be on the Toby Keith movie coming up.
[00:11:10.164 --> 00:11:11.185]  Beer for my horses.
[00:11:11.225 --> 00:11:16.429]  And even though I play a wild character, it's not unlike the way I live my life.
[00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:23.975]  So I try to be the best that I can be and try to penetrate as much of the media as possible to bring a U.S.
[00:11:24.055 --> 00:11:27.078]  Constitution and a Bill of Rights crowbar of truth
[00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:41.624]  Alright Ted, I want to bring up now just a few quick key questions for you and get answers on those.
[00:11:43.245 --> 00:11:47.107]  Because we're limited on time, the shortest answers we can possibly get from you.
[00:11:47.407 --> 00:11:49.728]  So I'm going to go ahead and ask you a few of those questions right now.
[00:11:50.697 --> 00:12:00.024]  We are talking with Ted Nugent, author, TV show host, of course, best known for being a great guitarist and a rock star, and in a few minutes we've got left with him today.
[00:12:00.725 --> 00:12:02.486]  Ted, the problem is the New World Order.
[00:12:02.506 --> 00:12:04.568]  The problem is the private Federal Reserve.
[00:12:05.028 --> 00:12:10.153]  And that's why both parties behave one way, the opposite of the Constitution, the Bill of Rights.
[00:12:10.673 --> 00:12:15.297]  The problem is, you talk about defending the Bill of Rights and the Constitution, and I know you're a good guy and believe in that,
[00:12:15.837 --> 00:12:31.981]  But when you actually look that they have used the Patriot Act on citizens and in non-terror-related cases, when you look at the fact that the presidency is getting powers that Barack Obama is going to have when Bush is gone, even if you think Bush is, at some levels, a good guy, how do you respond to that statement?
[00:12:32.041 --> 00:12:32.841]  How do we deal?
[00:12:33.021 --> 00:12:36.742]  Well, first, are you aware of the New World Order, the globalists, and how do we deal with them?
[00:12:37.122 --> 00:12:42.083]  Oh, I'm painfully aware of it, Alex, and it's important that you keep bringing this up because, once again, it is the
[00:12:42.551 --> 00:12:51.318]  The bending over of the apathetic Americans that have facilitated the destruction and the erosion of our individual rights is guaranteed by the U.S.
[00:12:51.338 --> 00:12:52.499]  Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[00:12:52.839 --> 00:13:05.889]  And once again, the most important duty, not just the job, but a moral, spiritual obligation of each and every American is to have a whistle firmly placed between their teeth
[00:13:06.371 --> 00:13:09.574]  And being prepared to blow that whistle constantly.
[00:13:09.895 --> 00:13:14.820]  We've missed out since the New Deal, and that was the beginning of the New World Order.
[00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:25.631]  And the loss of individual freedoms and liberties that have been pounded on the American citizens over the years is absolutely vulgar and heartbreaking.
[00:13:25.671 --> 00:13:27.132]  But we the people can fix that.
[00:13:27.172 --> 00:13:29.635]  If you look, I'll give you an example, real simple and short here.
[00:13:30.843 --> 00:13:34.565]  About twelve years ago, my gun permit was only good in about six states.
[00:13:35.045 --> 00:13:47.972]  Now it's good not only in 41 states as my concealed weapons permit, but as a sheriff's deputy, because we passed House Resolution 218, I can carry my gun nationwide, and I do daily.
[00:13:48.292 --> 00:13:54.816]  That's an example of how we can get the most politically incorrect, the most volatile issue, gun control,
[00:13:55.516 --> 00:14:01.979]  Fixed, if we the people hammer and we're joining organizations like the NRA and Gun Owners of America.
[00:14:01.999 --> 00:14:05.420]  But Ted, you would like to see nationwide, Vermont-style, correct?
[00:14:05.821 --> 00:14:10.302]  Well, number one, Alex, even without the U.S.
[00:14:10.342 --> 00:14:18.926]  Constitution or the Second Amendment, God gave me the gift of life and clearly the individual right and duty to protect that life.
[00:14:19.506 --> 00:14:20.787]  I don't need a document
[00:14:21.352 --> 00:14:24.593]  I don't need another human being to authorize jack squat.
[00:14:25.094 --> 00:14:26.534]  My life is worth protecting.
[00:14:26.554 --> 00:14:28.155]  It comes from God, not from the government.
[00:14:28.175 --> 00:14:28.795]  You're absolutely right, Tim.
[00:14:28.815 --> 00:14:33.217]  It comes from God, and the government should just listen to my song, don't tread on me.
[00:14:33.457 --> 00:14:34.497]  So we need to get back.
[00:14:34.797 --> 00:14:47.102]  What, Alex, when we have the inalienable, non-infringed right to keep and bear arms in the United States of America without any paperwork, that's when my job is complete.
[00:14:48.547 --> 00:14:57.989]  Ted, let's say there is a big terror attack, a nuke goes off, biological weapons are released, and we hear we've got to give in to martial law, whether it's George Bush or Barack Obama or John McCain in office.
[00:14:58.389 --> 00:15:01.050]  We hear we have to turn our guns in during an emergency.
[00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:05.251]  We see gun confiscation going on like happened in New Orleans.
[00:15:05.711 --> 00:15:08.872]  What is Ted Nugent going to do if the government ever comes to confiscate his guns?
[00:15:09.292 --> 00:15:22.396]  I've already addressed this issue many, many years, even before the tragedy of Katrina, where corrupt law enforcement authority did, in fact, confiscate privately owned law-abiding citizens' firearms.
[00:15:23.116 --> 00:15:28.998]  I have a great communication, and this doesn't mean that we can rest easy, Alex, but hear me good.
[00:15:30.126 --> 00:15:37.491]  I get to train with the world's greatest warriors, and the majority of law enforcement in this country are indeed the best of the best.
[00:15:37.991 --> 00:15:48.398]  And I assure you, my friend, though there will be examples like Katrina, where corrupt punks of law enforcement that's a lunatic fringe, it is not law enforcement in general.
[00:15:50.111 --> 00:16:03.904]  Yeah, well, believe me, I train with the FBI, I train with DEA, I train with the federal marshals, I conduct the Falcon Raids, federal and local cops organized nationally, where we arrest the world's most dangerous fugitive felons.
[00:16:04.725 --> 00:16:14.314]  Alex, I assure you that 90 plus percent of local, state, and federal law enforcement officials will not
[00:16:15.861 --> 00:16:23.645]  We had always thought that, but we saw New Orleans, now the Governor of Illinois is announcing the National Guard.
[00:16:23.665 --> 00:16:24.306]  Did you see this?
[00:16:24.566 --> 00:16:26.507]  It's going to help in quote, anti-gun sweeps.
[00:16:26.867 --> 00:16:28.188]  NBC News, did you see that?
[00:16:28.708 --> 00:16:29.269]  Yes, I did.
[00:16:29.909 --> 00:16:30.830]  What is your take on that?
[00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:38.214]  My point is, is that we the citizens must have a better dialogue, a better relationship with our local state and federal law enforcement.
[00:16:38.374 --> 00:16:39.075]  And remember Alex,
[00:16:39.515 --> 00:16:42.998]  I'm just a goofy guitar player, but I've been a sheriff's deputy for 32 years.
[00:16:43.478 --> 00:16:46.380]  I've been sworn in as a constable in McLennan County, Texas.
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:48.522]  So you're not going to hand your guns over is what you're saying?
[00:16:49.703 --> 00:16:50.443]  Lead first.
[00:16:51.624 --> 00:16:54.987]  Well, I mean, it's happening, Ted, in Illinois.
[00:16:55.307 --> 00:16:58.229]  It happened in New Jersey and California 20 years ago, Alex.
[00:16:58.490 --> 00:16:58.850]  I know!
[00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:06.356]  So I just want the people to know you're an icon out there, that Ted Nugent is aware of this, because some people, some conservatives are still in denial.
[00:17:06.616 --> 00:17:08.037]  We're trying to raise the alarm here.
[00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:26.409]  I promise you this, Alex, if the vulgarity, the obscenity of Nazi-like tactics was ever implemented by the United States government or any of their law enforcement arms, there would be blood in the streets, and I promise you this, we the people would win.
[00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:34.094]  And if anybody in the government is monitoring this, my name is Ted Nugent, and if you come to take my guns, I will shoot you dead.
[00:17:36.454 --> 00:17:37.395]  Amazing interview.
[00:17:37.715 --> 00:17:41.018]  Folks, visit InfoWars.com, TedNugent.com.

[00:17:55.211 --> 00:17:58.834]  Well, I'm on it, Alex, and God bless you and God bless all my friends across America, man.
[00:17:58.954 --> 00:17:59.635]  Okay, thank you.
[00:17:59.675 --> 00:18:00.536]  Folks, we'll be right back.
[00:18:01.949 --> 00:18:06.674]  Okay, Ted... Take my guns, I will shoot you dead!
[00:18:08.936 --> 00:18:10.858]  Amazing interview, folks.

[00:19:23.567 --> 00:19:26.608]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[00:19:26.988 --> 00:19:29.049]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[00:19:29.289 --> 00:19:32.310]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:39.012]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[00:19:39.472 --> 00:19:41.673]  Online from my desk with Webex.
[00:19:42.094 --> 00:19:45.175]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[00:19:45.375 --> 00:19:50.018]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[00:19:50.158 --> 00:19:53.860]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.621]  Travel less, meet online.
[00:19:55.721 --> 00:19:58.202]  Go to Webex.com and try Webex free.

[00:20:05.506 --> 00:20:08.287]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[00:20:08.347 --> 00:20:09.247]  And we knew what to do.
[00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:32.671]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:20:57.594 --> 00:20:57.674]  John!
[00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:28.190]  Yes, sir.
[00:21:29.291 --> 00:21:30.131]  This is crazy.
[00:21:30.151 --> 00:21:32.272]  Dealing with these rock stars is crazy.
[00:21:32.352 --> 00:21:33.672]  They got busy schedules.
[00:21:33.732 --> 00:21:37.354]  Ted was just going to be on for 30 minutes, but...
[00:21:53.951 --> 00:21:56.253]  I think he canceled his other interview and is coming on longer.
[00:21:56.333 --> 00:21:58.335]  He wanted to, I guess, come back on longer.
[00:21:59.295 --> 00:22:05.140]  So, we're going to have him call back here in just a moment and spend some more time with us.
[00:22:05.881 --> 00:22:07.002]  Because, wow!
[00:22:07.122 --> 00:22:11.605]  I mean, I really threw the gauntlet down to Ted Nugent and said, what do you do when they come for your guns?
[00:22:11.625 --> 00:22:15.288]  We've got the National Guard now being used in gun sweeps in Illinois.
[00:22:15.328 --> 00:22:16.630]  I mean, that's NBC News.
[00:22:17.472 --> 00:22:18.633]  The governor announced it.
[00:22:19.453 --> 00:22:20.433]  The mayor announced it.
[00:22:20.473 --> 00:22:22.174]  We've got all this other craziness happening.
[00:22:22.214 --> 00:22:32.259]  I've seen polls where as high as 98 percent, they've had national law enforcement polls, over and over again it's 98 percent saying we will not confiscate guns, we're pro-Second Amendment.
[00:22:32.539 --> 00:22:35.560]  Because police know about guns, they know they actually reduce crime.
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:40.623]  Your average cop is somebody who grew up with firearms and doesn't want to have theirs taken when they retire.
[00:22:41.243 --> 00:22:42.564]  And so they,
[00:22:43.544 --> 00:22:48.846]  It's quite a world where the bureaucrats and the mayors and the government wants to disarm the public to make us disarm serfs.
[00:22:49.966 --> 00:22:55.388]  But then we have the police that don't want to confiscate our guns.
[00:22:56.248 --> 00:22:58.589]  And that's a true statement from Ted Nugent.
[00:22:59.569 --> 00:23:06.992]  And this is where things get confusing because the people on the left and right at the grassroots just want liberty and freedom.
[00:23:07.312 --> 00:23:09.633]  Most of the liberals I know are becoming pro-Second Amendment.
[00:23:10.413 --> 00:23:16.276]  But the establishment is more anti-Second Amendment and self-defense than ever before.
[00:23:18.358 --> 00:23:23.080]  And so it has been quite a wild interview with Ted Nugent today.
[00:23:24.221 --> 00:23:27.763]  For those joining us, the websites are InfoWars.com and
[00:23:28.885 --> 00:23:31.930]  PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.net, JonesReport.com.
[00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:41.085]  My new film, Truth Rising, is the most important film I've ever made because it really shows you who the grassroots are resisting tyranny and it's done in the cinema verite.
[00:23:41.405 --> 00:23:43.088]  In French, that means the cinema of truth.
[00:23:44.696 --> 00:23:45.857]  And it really is the truth.
[00:23:45.897 --> 00:23:46.577]  It is the lens.
[00:23:46.617 --> 00:23:47.597]  It is what the lens saw.
[00:23:48.197 --> 00:23:50.458]  It is not any voiceover or any of my opinions.
[00:23:51.078 --> 00:23:55.360]  It is an amazing documentary available at InfoWars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:23:59.321 --> 00:24:04.822]  And we have former Congressman Dan Hamburg coming on to talk about the growing police state in about 25 minutes.
[00:24:05.282 --> 00:24:11.063]  And then I'm also scheduled to have John Hunt, son of the famous CIA Black Op commander, former CIA section chief.
[00:24:11.563 --> 00:24:14.204]  He cut his interview short last week because of a congressman who was on.
[00:24:14.224 --> 00:24:17.004]  So we're going to have him back on the day to take your phone calls.
[00:24:17.344 --> 00:24:24.285]  Coming up in the fourth hour about, that's about an hour and 25 minutes from now.
[00:24:25.866 --> 00:24:28.526]  John, just let me know as soon as Nugent is back on the line, okay?
[00:24:30.404 --> 00:24:30.684]  He's here.
[00:24:31.064 --> 00:24:31.664]  He is here.
[00:24:32.464 --> 00:24:33.805]  Wow, what a surprise!
[00:24:33.845 --> 00:24:39.646]  We only had a 30-minute interview with him and then I guess something opened up and Ted said, why not do some more?
[00:24:40.066 --> 00:24:43.486]  So he's with us for another 24 minutes or so.
[00:24:43.506 --> 00:24:49.687]  If you want to talk to Ted Nugent, specifically for Ted Nugent, John, make sure they're for him on the subject of Second Amendment and liberty, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:49.707 --> 00:24:49.768]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:49.808 --> 00:24:52.068]  Wow, Mr. Nugent, it's good to have you back so soon.
[00:24:58.209 --> 00:25:00.871]  Alex, I'm pleased to return to your campfire, sir.
[00:25:00.891 --> 00:25:01.191]  Thank you.
[00:25:10.666 --> 00:25:18.648]  What will happen if any tyrannical government under Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, the Easter Bunny, John McCain, comes to confiscate Ted Nugent's guns?
[00:25:19.088 --> 00:25:22.229]  You said they will get it lead first, and they will be in a pool of blood.
[00:25:22.569 --> 00:25:24.709]  And that is the attitude that built this country.
[00:25:24.969 --> 00:25:29.490]  And for those that demonize the Founding Fathers, and say that they're bad, what do you say to them?
[00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:35.512]  Well, you know, I'm constantly attacked for being an extremist, Alex, and I'm very proud of that label.
[00:25:35.572 --> 00:25:36.752]  I'm an extreme American.
[00:25:37.276 --> 00:25:58.203]  I believe in extreme independence and extreme liberty, and that means being a positive asset to my family, my neighborhood, and my country by being as productive as I can and to optimize my good over evil, my law-abiding life and my law-abiding family over lawbreakers and dangerous people.
[00:25:58.743 --> 00:26:05.986]  That being said, I find that, again, in my travels, I'm speaking to you from the Quad Cities of Iowa here on the Mississippi River.
[00:26:06.565 --> 00:26:09.126]  I perform every night, but I don't just do my concerts.
[00:26:09.686 --> 00:26:10.806]  I hang out with people.
[00:26:10.866 --> 00:26:17.829]  I have members of my Ted News United Sportsmen Organization, NRA members, Gun Owners of America, law enforcement.
[00:26:18.169 --> 00:26:25.251]  Every night, Alex, I have state, local, and federal law enforcement agents come back just for a rock and roll event.
[00:26:25.291 --> 00:26:30.293]  It's just coincidental that they happen to be dedicated heroes of law enforcement.
[00:26:30.653 --> 00:26:34.674]  And I assure you that if a tyrannical government attempted to
[00:26:35.763 --> 00:26:43.822]  Infringe upon our freedoms to that dastardly Katrina level of privately owned, law-abiding citizens' gun confiscation.
[00:26:44.463 --> 00:26:45.406]  At my side!
[00:26:45.979 --> 00:27:01.053]  would be law enforcement heroes who would stand with the citizens of this country and, like a few good men, would refuse to implement an order against the Constitution and against self-evident, truth-based freedoms and liberties.
[00:27:01.373 --> 00:27:07.319]  But that will be optimized by how we the people communicate with our local law enforcement.
[00:27:07.559 --> 00:27:09.581]  You know, Alex, I'm astounded
[00:27:10.319 --> 00:27:37.319]  When I meet an American citizen that doesn't know who his sheriff is, that doesn't know his chief of police, and who have failed to sit down and have a decent, short, but regular conversation with these heroes so that they can have a communication, they can have a relationship, and that they emphasize to law enforcement that this is my family's name, this is where we live, we are dedicated to supporting law enforcement and be law-abiding,
[00:27:38.019 --> 00:27:51.426]  And to be the ears and eyes of our neighborhood, but make sure you know that the law enforcement agents work for we the people, and those are our laws they are enforcing.
[00:27:51.686 --> 00:27:56.288]  But that communication, Alex, is almost nonexistent in this country.
[00:27:58.069 --> 00:28:06.233]  Oh, Ted, you have hit the nail directly on the head, and let me throw this out at you and then get your response and your analysis from Ted Nugent.
[00:28:07.386 --> 00:28:08.983]  Ted, we get...
[00:28:10.569 --> 00:28:13.850]  Sixty percent turnouts on average for presidential elections.
[00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:20.191]  We get forty five percent turnouts on average for off-year national elections for Congress and the Senate.
[00:28:20.791 --> 00:28:24.332]  But locally the national average is about eight percent.
[00:28:24.392 --> 00:28:26.052]  Here in Austin it's about eight point five.
[00:28:26.993 --> 00:28:28.533]  I saw that in the paper last election.
[00:28:29.153 --> 00:28:37.335]  So this really is a key point that we look at the federal government, the internationalists, the UN coming in trying to take control of the feds through treaties,
[00:28:38.795 --> 00:28:40.376]  The people aren't at the parapets.
[00:28:40.396 --> 00:28:43.859]  They're not at the Alamo's walls in the local government.
[00:28:44.139 --> 00:28:53.866]  And if we would come out and get involved and really run for office and check the candidates and support the good candidates, there is nothing on earth that could stop us.
[00:28:54.406 --> 00:29:06.255]  Well, let's look at some of the manifestations of a social depravity that has been self-afflicted, inflicted, and a choice of an embarrassing percentage of Americans.
[00:29:06.535 --> 00:29:08.236]  Let's look at obesity for a second.
[00:29:09.162 --> 00:29:17.949]  That is a physical manifestation of a cultural deprivation where people just don't give a damn.
[00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:19.871]  They don't care.
[00:29:20.885 --> 00:29:21.966]  Too many Americans.
[00:29:22.506 --> 00:29:25.710]  Let's first identify the good, because there's lots of good out there.
[00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:29.594]  There's lots of ultra-hardworking, good, decent citizens.
[00:29:29.634 --> 00:29:32.277]  But we have to identify the bad so we can stop doing it.
[00:29:32.558 --> 00:29:37.083]  We have to identify the flat tire, no matter how good that pickup truck is.
[00:29:37.503 --> 00:29:40.887]  And the flat tire in America is apathy.
[00:29:42.031 --> 00:29:48.997]  And everyone listening to us right now, they're clenching their fists and going, yeah, that's right, goddamn that's right.
[00:29:49.277 --> 00:29:51.599]  Well, don't just say yeah to the radio.
[00:29:51.639 --> 00:29:54.021]  Don't just say yeah to your buddies around the campfire.
[00:29:54.301 --> 00:29:57.243]  Don't just say yeah to your buddies around the water cooler.
[00:29:57.663 --> 00:30:01.646]  Call your damn senator and your congressman and your mayor and your governor.
[00:30:01.987 --> 00:30:06.190]  Call your state rep and start identifying the horrors
[00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:18.984]  of welfare corruption and waste, the bureaucratic fedzilla of gluttonous, slovenly, wasteful, anti-American agendas that is widespread across this country.
[00:30:19.444 --> 00:30:30.008]  Any American who hasn't made an impact on their elected officials is a bad, negative, liability American.
[00:30:30.598 --> 00:30:35.221]  We've got to be in the asset column and that means being involved in raising hell!
[00:30:49.210 --> 00:31:07.345]  They plan to bring in green taxes that have nothing to do with conservation, which I know you and I are for in real environmentalism, but hijacking that whole movement to say what kind of light bulbs, what type of toilets, to tell you what you can and can't do, to tell you where you can put a bottling company, to tell you where you can put a factory.
[00:31:07.785 --> 00:31:19.208]  Total regulatory control and taxing all of our cars, taxing the air we exhale, saying carbon dioxide is deadly poison when all the studies show that global heating and cooling is natural.
[00:31:19.488 --> 00:31:35.852]  We have this huge international movement to bring in these taxes and I have a stack of news here today where they are bringing in this whole new level where you're going to have bureaucrats involved in your daily life, they're going to hire high school kids to be quote climate cops, to spy on us,
[00:31:36.852 --> 00:31:37.894]  Are you aware of all this, Ted?
[00:31:38.234 --> 00:31:39.136]  I'm aware of all of it.
[00:31:39.156 --> 00:31:46.688]  In fact, I have numerous chapters in my new book, Ted White and Blue, that identifies the horror of the Fedzilla
[00:31:47.344 --> 00:31:50.545]  Bulldozer that is plowing through our freedom and our liberty.
[00:31:50.845 --> 00:31:52.786]  Believe me, I've identified all this stuff.
[00:31:53.566 --> 00:31:59.207]  And I've got a huge chapter dedicated to how the Nugent family lives and how we raise hell.
[00:31:59.247 --> 00:32:05.709]  We figure that we have to raise hell at least one day a week to even deserve freedom the other six days.
[00:32:06.069 --> 00:32:12.391]  And if the rest of America would do this, Alex, I'm going to tell you, we could stop FEDZILLA in its tracks.
[00:32:12.731 --> 00:32:15.994]  But Fedzilla is eating his boss.
[00:32:16.355 --> 00:32:19.458]  The boss of the bureaucrats is We The People.
[00:32:19.698 --> 00:32:27.846]  But right now, senators and congressmen are so arrogant and so convinced that We The People don't give a damn, as long as we're fat.
[00:32:28.366 --> 00:32:40.255]  Stupid and drunk, and we've got a sporting event to watch on television, and we've got a six-pack, and we can conduct ourselves in an indulgent and gluttonous fashion that they can tax us into oblivion.
[00:32:40.275 --> 00:32:45.398]  That's an example, and boy, I go into great detail about how we should just eliminate the FDA.
[00:32:45.659 --> 00:32:47.420]  We should eliminate the USDA.
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.802]  We should eliminate the EPA.
[00:32:50.022 --> 00:32:51.583]  We should eliminate OSHA.
[00:32:51.943 --> 00:32:57.964]  We should eliminate all these bureaucratic pigs that don't accomplish a damn good thing for America.
[00:32:57.984 --> 00:33:05.226]  Well, I'll say this, if somebody hurts the environment or hurts somebody else, they are liable criminally and through the courts, you're absolutely right.
[00:33:05.566 --> 00:33:12.948]  Instead, they selectively enforce, shut down our industry and move it to China and Mexico, where there's no environmental standards.
[00:33:14.388 --> 00:33:32.243]  Ted, how do we deal with the child protective services that are running around kidnapping 1.4 million children a year with no due process A, and then B, how do we deal with all of these other forms of governmental piracy that are going on?
[00:33:32.724 --> 00:33:35.026]  Well, once again, it's all about raising hell.
[00:33:36.044 --> 00:33:40.066]  Communicating with your neighbors and forming a community voice.
[00:33:40.606 --> 00:33:49.550]  And I could give you a thousand examples of how we've been able to nip bureaucratic bulldozers in the bud, Alex, by just simple community activism.
[00:33:49.950 --> 00:34:03.817]  You know, if one person shows up at a community hearing where they're going to take our tax dollars and pay government shooters to go kill our deer for us, but we the people are not allowed
[00:34:04.557 --> 00:34:10.080]  Well, Ted, for those that don't know, take outside Austin in one of the suburbs.
[00:34:10.481 --> 00:34:11.721]  They pay him $2,000 a deer.
[00:34:23.208 --> 00:34:29.151]  To trap them and then to fly them to Mexico and most of them die on the way because of distress.
[00:34:29.552 --> 00:34:34.254]  There are starving deer in my neighborhood stumbling around, falling into each other.
[00:34:34.754 --> 00:34:35.735]  They've been run over.
[00:34:36.035 --> 00:34:37.136]  There's no predators.
[00:34:37.436 --> 00:34:38.396]  They're everywhere.
[00:34:38.416 --> 00:34:40.878]  That is allowed to happen in Texas.
[00:34:41.658 --> 00:34:43.559]  That's bizarre!
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.823]  Meanwhile, you're big, tough Texas ranchers and you're big, tough Texas hunters.
[00:34:49.244 --> 00:34:52.526]  Hunting is a $6 billion a year industry in Texas.
[00:34:52.886 --> 00:34:58.731]  The Texas Parks and Wildlife have done a good job, but if you were a good bass player, you couldn't be in my band.
[00:34:58.911 --> 00:35:04.495]  They're supposed to do a great job, and when American citizens' tax dollars are raped and pillaged,
[00:35:05.195 --> 00:35:09.839]  In damage control, instead of allowing we, the people, to implement quality control, i.e.
[00:35:09.859 --> 00:35:19.086]  the utilization of that wildlife resource as an asset instead of a liability, my head hangs and I weep tears of tyranny.
[00:35:19.266 --> 00:35:22.788]  So this is the kind of issues that I have in my head, white and blue.
[00:35:23.069 --> 00:35:34.077]  And the fix is fixable overnight, Alex, if we just get a dozen people to pound the desk and go, leave our resources alone.
[00:35:34.657 --> 00:35:38.459]  Open the door to bureaucratic red tape so that we can utilize it.
[00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:42.002]  Again, it's not just about deer or nuisance geese at the airport.
[00:35:42.322 --> 00:35:43.422]  It's about control.
[00:35:43.482 --> 00:35:50.086]  It's about these individuals want to lock off more than half the country and not even let humans into them under United Nations treaties.
[00:35:50.407 --> 00:35:55.690]  And George Bush signed back onto UNESCO that does that, that Ronald Reagan pulled us out of.
[00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:56.871]  That's what I'm talking about.
[00:35:57.131 --> 00:35:58.431]  Well, I'm talking about citizens.
[00:35:58.451 --> 00:36:01.954]  How about the simplest of simple, common sense things?
[00:36:02.554 --> 00:36:03.955]  I've got a pickup truck, Alex.
[00:36:04.821 --> 00:36:05.862]  It's registered.
[00:36:06.502 --> 00:36:08.063]  It has a license plate.
[00:36:08.603 --> 00:36:10.264]  I've got the registration.
[00:36:11.144 --> 00:36:11.885]  It's done.
[00:36:12.425 --> 00:36:17.448]  Why on God's good green earth do I have to register it again?
[00:36:18.368 --> 00:36:19.589]  It's registered.
[00:36:20.109 --> 00:36:22.250]  Leave me alone.
[00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:26.913]  Absolutely, and why do we have warrantless checkpoints, and why is all of this happening?
[00:36:26.953 --> 00:36:33.316]  Well, again, our friends listening right now, they're nodding their heads, and I've got to tell you,
[00:36:33.883 --> 00:36:57.875]  It's gotta be 90 plus percent, I don't care, liberal, conservative, democrat, republican, 90 plus percent of America, when push comes to shove, would agree with a list of the self-evident truths that I outline in Ted White and Blue, and that you talk about every day on your radio show, and that I communicate with people across this nation every day, but they don't do a damn thing
[00:36:58.195 --> 00:36:58.756]  Well, you're right.
[00:36:58.796 --> 00:37:06.041]  I mean, people keep calling me saying what I need to do to save the country, and I try to explain to them the solution is looking at them in the mirror.
[00:37:06.221 --> 00:37:07.462]  Okay, I don't have all the answers.
[00:37:07.542 --> 00:37:08.803]  Okay, I don't have all the solutions.
[00:37:09.463 --> 00:37:11.225]  It's up to you, and I know this.
[00:37:11.905 --> 00:37:18.030]  Apathy is a green light to tyranny, and we're basically like legless, blind, deaf sheep
[00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:20.392]  Who have been laid out in the field for wolves.
[00:37:20.553 --> 00:37:22.135]  Stop being a sheep.
[00:37:22.615 --> 00:37:26.440]  Stand up like a sheepdog and fight back and that's when things are going to turn around.
[00:37:26.661 --> 00:37:30.125]  I'm going to skip this final break so we can go right up to the end of the hour with Ted Nugent.
[00:37:30.165 --> 00:37:32.268]  Let's talk to John in Texas.
[00:37:32.288 --> 00:37:33.870]  You're on the air with Ted Nugent.
[00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:34.231]  Go ahead.
[00:37:35.677 --> 00:37:44.265]  Yeah, I would just like to say that Ted Nugent would be an awesome addition to the Freedom Truth Concert that you, Alex, and Willie Nelson are putting on.
[00:37:44.605 --> 00:37:51.051]  Well, that's not even complete and set yet, but do you have any other comments for our guest?
[00:37:52.182 --> 00:37:56.745]  Well, you know, if that concert does happen, I would just like to say that Ted would be an awesome addition.
[00:37:56.765 --> 00:37:57.565]  That's my two cents.
[00:37:57.945 --> 00:37:58.766]  Thanks for watching.
[00:37:58.806 --> 00:37:59.966]  God bless you for that, my friend.
[00:38:00.067 --> 00:38:00.947]  Thank you so much.
[00:38:01.067 --> 00:38:03.829]  Let's go ahead and talk to Eric in Wisconsin.
[00:38:04.149 --> 00:38:05.430]  Eric, you're on the air with Ted Nugent.
[00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:05.810]  Go ahead.
[00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:06.910]  Hey, Mr. Nugent.
[00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:07.611]  How are you doing today?
[00:38:07.851 --> 00:38:09.592]  Greetings in the great Badger State, Eric.
[00:38:10.132 --> 00:38:11.393]  Yes, you've been here a few times.
[00:38:11.473 --> 00:38:13.134]  I've actually watched you in concert.
[00:38:13.584 --> 00:38:19.770]  Yeah, well Eric, get ready because the Nugent band is going to carpet bomb Wisconsin in the next couple of weeks and it's going to be great to be back up there.
[00:38:20.251 --> 00:38:20.531]  Awesome.
[00:38:20.951 --> 00:38:21.332]  Oh, man.
[00:38:21.632 --> 00:38:23.854]  Hey, listen, I want to really thank you for doing your part.
[00:38:24.995 --> 00:38:29.760]  You're a real inspiration because I've been, I guess, teetering on the balance.
[00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:31.401]  I see where people come from.
[00:38:31.441 --> 00:38:34.945]  They're afraid to do things because they're afraid that there's going to be repercussions.
[00:38:37.202 --> 00:38:39.144]  I put two and two together, and that's what heroes do.
[00:38:39.284 --> 00:38:43.928]  Well, inaction is action, and by laying there, you're saying, run over me.
[00:38:44.128 --> 00:38:47.230]  See, people think just laying there being a spectator, they're not in the game.
[00:38:47.291 --> 00:38:48.331]  No, you're being run over.
[00:38:48.552 --> 00:38:49.492]  You're in the center lane.
[00:38:49.833 --> 00:38:51.834]  Let me give you a metaphor, if I may, Alex.
[00:38:52.295 --> 00:38:52.515]  Yeah.
[00:38:53.135 --> 00:38:54.196]  My name is Ted Nugent.
[00:38:54.857 --> 00:38:56.939]  I run a bagel shop in Nuremberg.
[00:38:57.019 --> 00:39:04.345]  It's 1936, and a bunch of brown-shirt punks are trying to tell me and my family to get on the train.
[00:39:04.787 --> 00:39:06.087]  Well, you know what Ted Nugent does?
[00:39:06.707 --> 00:39:10.789]  I take the Luger from the punk in the brown shirt, and I shoot him dead.
[00:39:11.169 --> 00:39:16.790]  And I prod my fellow Jews to never, ever obey an order to get on the train.
[00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:19.031]  And America better wake the hell up.
[00:39:19.551 --> 00:39:26.112]  Demand that we respond viciously against the attack dogs of tyranny.
[00:39:26.432 --> 00:39:31.014]  And we take the Luger away from the brown shirt, and we shoot the son of a bitch dead.
[00:39:31.394 --> 00:39:32.314]  Both literally,
[00:39:33.001 --> 00:39:33.942]  And figuratively.
[00:39:34.242 --> 00:39:38.844]  And if Americans keep getting on the train, they will end up in the showers.
[00:39:39.304 --> 00:39:40.085]  Cut it out!
[00:39:42.566 --> 00:39:45.367]  Where do you see America going if we don't turn things around?
[00:39:45.427 --> 00:39:51.691]  I mean, Barack Obama wants a million-person youth brigade armed to, quote, spy on the American people.
[00:39:51.731 --> 00:39:55.052]  They're creating environmental youth brigades to spy on people?
[00:39:55.793 --> 00:40:00.215]  Well, and again, my confidence soars on the wings of an American eagle, Alex.
[00:40:01.138 --> 00:40:03.980]  Again, the pulse I bring you from my travels every year.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.161]  This is my 50th year.
[00:40:05.221 --> 00:40:07.283]  I just performed my 6,000th concert.
[00:40:07.303 --> 00:40:08.264]  That was another question I had.
[00:40:08.284 --> 00:40:09.425]  Do you see people waking up?
[00:40:09.865 --> 00:40:10.606]  I really do.
[00:40:10.626 --> 00:40:13.208]  And again, I'm not promoting my website.
[00:40:13.248 --> 00:40:14.509]  I'm promoting activism.
[00:40:14.549 --> 00:40:16.050]  But go to TedNugent.com.
[00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:18.051]  In fact, Alex, we've got to organize it.
[00:40:18.432 --> 00:40:22.255]  If I can get on every day, you can find time to get on every day.
[00:40:22.295 --> 00:40:23.796]  And I want to see Alex Jones
[00:40:24.256 --> 00:40:41.284]  on my talkback board, and you won't believe the people that were just basically couch potato, do-nothing, apathetic sheep, who are growing horns because of the inspiration and the rallying cry, the battle cry.
[00:40:41.424 --> 00:40:46.867]  You really want a million info warriors to paratroop down into your message board, okay?
[00:40:47.207 --> 00:40:48.648]  Watch out what you ask for, Ted.
[00:40:48.968 --> 00:40:50.909]  Well, I hope so, because I've got to tell you,
[00:40:51.709 --> 00:40:52.930]  I am not the commander.
[00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:56.091]  I am just a soldier in this activism war.
[00:40:56.211 --> 00:41:03.513]  I have some much brighter, much more wiser individuals than me, and I absorb that kind of wisdom, and it's all over my website.
[00:41:03.853 --> 00:41:04.514]  Absolutely.
[00:41:04.874 --> 00:41:06.554]  Anything else, Eric, in Wisconsin?
[00:41:07.275 --> 00:41:07.795]  I'm on board.
[00:41:07.815 --> 00:41:08.335]  Let's do it.
[00:41:09.495 --> 00:41:11.436]  I'm not going to sit around anymore and watch this happen.
[00:41:15.913 --> 00:41:30.568]  Go to your city council, speak out on what issues are important to you, start a website, call into radio talk shows like you're doing now, and raise hell with Governor Doyle up there in Wisconsin who doesn't believe in the Second Amendment, while innocent Wisconsin people
[00:41:30.928 --> 00:41:37.653]  Are forced into unarmed helplessness because there's no concealed weapon statute in the great state of Wisconsin and innocent people are dying.
[00:41:37.693 --> 00:41:44.518]  And we know the crime rate drops by on average 20% within two years of a concealed carry going in.
[00:41:44.759 --> 00:41:49.082]  My name is Ted Nugent, wherever I am is not a gun-free zone.
[00:41:49.262 --> 00:41:50.703]  Alright, thank you Eric.
[00:41:51.104 --> 00:41:52.284]  Let's go to Judith.
[00:41:52.725 --> 00:41:55.026]  Go to Judith now in British Columbia.
[00:41:55.067 --> 00:41:56.227]  You're on the air with Ted Nugent.
[00:41:56.588 --> 00:41:58.129]  Judith, God bless British Columbia.
[00:41:58.149 --> 00:41:59.510]  I just came back from Vancouver.
[00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:00.770]  What's that?
[00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:03.212]  I just got home from Vancouver, Judith.
[00:42:03.232 --> 00:42:04.933]  You have a beautiful God's country up there.
[00:42:05.273 --> 00:42:05.893]  Yes, we do.
[00:42:06.194 --> 00:42:06.594]  We do.
[00:42:06.614 --> 00:42:07.214]  We certainly do.
[00:42:09.776 --> 00:42:19.402]  To direct a question to you, I've got about twelve questions, about seven comments, two or three areas of disagreement, and one plug.
[00:42:19.542 --> 00:42:24.585]  But to direct something in your line would be, can we
[00:42:29.119 --> 00:42:36.666]  Do you have a lawsuit action against the media for lying to us about 9-11?
[00:42:36.686 --> 00:42:36.946]  No, we can't.
[00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:39.120]  Why?
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:44.362]  But we can raise hell and raise such a pulse on the streets of our nation.
[00:42:44.382 --> 00:43:05.092]  Hey, Judith, what we need to do is we need to... Can we sue these governors, Ted, that are trying to stop our First Amendment and our Second Amendment rights, like New York continues to sue gun manufacturers all over the country trying to take our rights in Texas and other states, and to me that's racketeering and a civil rights violation.
[00:43:05.132 --> 00:43:05.892]  Judith, thanks for the call.
[00:43:06.372 --> 00:43:18.897]  Judith, I hope Judith is listening because I spent a lot of time in Canada, Alex, and they held rallies with hundreds of thousands of people in the capitals of the different provinces of Canada.
[00:43:18.917 --> 00:43:19.917]  To not have their guns taken.
[00:43:20.377 --> 00:43:25.519]  But they still had to deal with the outrageous anti-freedom bureaucracy
[00:43:26.454 --> 00:43:28.234]  That's still a monster of C-68.
[00:43:28.414 --> 00:43:30.155]  We can go into details on that.
[00:43:30.195 --> 00:43:31.595]  I'm sure you've talked about it in the past.
[00:43:32.115 --> 00:43:41.177]  But just like New York, do you realize how many citizens in New York do own guns and do carry guns in total violation of the Sullivan Law?
[00:43:41.997 --> 00:43:52.779]  That's because as long as they don't bring attention to themselves, they think that they can go on being illegal while the policies guarantee
[00:43:53.593 --> 00:43:57.876]  The helpless, unarmed victims of violent recidivism every day.
[00:43:57.916 --> 00:44:01.058]  And now the police do random Fourth Amendment violations.
[00:44:01.098 --> 00:44:04.980]  I've been there where they lock down whole streets and start searching everyone.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.861]  I mean, that's Nazi Germany right there.
[00:44:06.901 --> 00:44:12.225]  Let's take one final call from Travis in Seattle for the one and only Ted Nugent.
[00:44:12.265 --> 00:44:13.065]  Go ahead, Travis.
[00:44:13.285 --> 00:44:13.826]  Hello, Travis.
[00:44:14.454 --> 00:44:16.375]  Hey Ted, I just got a question for you.
[00:44:16.415 --> 00:44:20.217]  You said you work with law enforcement as like a federal helper or something?
[00:44:20.237 --> 00:44:23.999]  Yes, I conduct federal raids with law enforcement against fugitive felons.
[00:44:24.699 --> 00:44:30.982]  Okay, do you believe that the Constitution refers to a crime as something that goes against your life, liberty, or property?
[00:44:31.983 --> 00:44:32.363]  Certainly.
[00:44:33.223 --> 00:44:38.706]  Okay, so just as a hypothetical, say I had a field full of weed here.
[00:44:39.747 --> 00:44:42.468]  Would you be involved in coming and taking it from me?
[00:44:43.359 --> 00:44:54.152]  Well, I gotta tell you, Travis, I've been a rock and roller all my life, and I've watched the lie of dope smoking being a victimless crime.
[00:44:54.172 --> 00:44:56.856]  I have attended way too many funerals.
[00:44:57.415 --> 00:45:05.438]  And visited way too many paraplegic and quadriplegics because people getting high have destroyed innocent lives every day.
[00:45:05.758 --> 00:45:26.885]  So we as a citizenry must identify that conduct and those procedures by which innocent victims are being destroyed and mutilated and killed every day so that some mindless hippie can smoke dope and drop out and you're goddamn right I'd raid that place because I want people who want to get stoned and become a liability to
[00:45:27.245 --> 00:45:29.667]  Travis, thank you for the call.
[00:45:29.948 --> 00:45:31.629]  We have to end it here on a negative note.
[00:45:31.989 --> 00:45:34.091]  Ted, we've got triple the heroin, double the cocaine.
[00:45:34.251 --> 00:45:35.592]  It's like prohibition with alcohol.
[00:45:35.632 --> 00:45:36.673]  It made it increase.
[00:45:36.713 --> 00:45:38.255]  It corrupted our police.
[00:45:38.815 --> 00:45:39.676]  I don't smoke pot.
[00:45:40.036 --> 00:45:42.558]  I don't like people bumbling around stoned around me.
[00:45:42.799 --> 00:45:47.242]  But I don't think they should be locked up in prisons for 20 cents an hour taking my job away.
[00:45:47.483 --> 00:45:49.985]  That's why I think we need to really look at these drug laws.
[00:45:50.505 --> 00:45:55.106]  I think we do need to look at the drug laws, but what we really need is going back to that apathy, Alex.
[00:45:55.606 --> 00:45:58.907]  So you don't like apathy and you think marijuana adds to apathy?
[00:46:00.447 --> 00:46:08.829]  The entire desire of getting stoned is to become a lump, to become apathetic, and to drop out, and to become a liability.
[00:46:09.189 --> 00:46:11.569]  And that's irresponsible and that's dangerous.
[00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:13.110]  I don't want to pay for him in prison.
[00:46:13.650 --> 00:46:16.070]  I don't want to pay for him in prison either, quite honestly.
[00:46:16.511 --> 00:46:18.411]  Alex, you know, God bless you for doing this.
[00:46:19.131 --> 00:46:23.953]  And God bless you for facilitating and celebrating my First Amendment rights.
[00:46:24.014 --> 00:46:24.334]  You bet.
[00:46:24.354 --> 00:46:25.854]  Ted Nugent, it was great having you on.
[00:46:26.075 --> 00:46:27.655]  Let us have you back up soon.
[00:46:28.136 --> 00:46:28.796]  I hope so.
[00:46:28.836 --> 00:46:30.877]  Godspeed to everybody and a happy Independence Day.
[00:46:31.783 --> 00:46:32.523]  Let me say bye to him.
[00:46:33.323 --> 00:46:34.884]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:46:35.284 --> 00:46:36.164]  He's probably already gone.
[00:46:51.509 --> 00:46:56.331]  And God bless you for facilitating and celebrating my First Amendment rights.
[00:46:56.451 --> 00:46:56.771]  You bet.
[00:46:56.791 --> 00:46:58.292]  Ted Nugent, it was great having you on.
[00:46:58.532 --> 00:47:00.092]  Let us have you back up soon.
[00:47:00.512 --> 00:47:01.173]  I hope so.
[00:47:01.233 --> 00:47:03.293]  Godspeed to everybody and a happy Independence Day.
[00:47:03.733 --> 00:47:05.654]  Let me say bye to him.
[00:47:05.694 --> 00:47:07.275]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:47:08.215 --> 00:47:10.516]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:18.101]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:47:18.121 --> 00:47:20.762]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:47:20.782 --> 00:47:21.922]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:47:21.942 --> 00:47:23.563]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:47:23.643 --> 00:47:26.484]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:47:26.544 --> 00:47:30.165]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:47:39.823 --> 00:47:44.716]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:47:45.973 --> 00:47:47.133]  An inside job?
[00:47:48.494 --> 00:47:49.574]  How dare you?
[00:47:50.935 --> 00:47:55.997]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:47:56.157 --> 00:47:58.798]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:47:58.898 --> 00:48:04.360]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of that.
[00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:05.320]  Truth Rises.
[00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:07.921]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[00:48:08.221 --> 00:48:10.202]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:48:10.482 --> 00:48:12.943]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:18.937]  Ted Nugent just said he wants to come on with Ted Reports on a routine basis.
[00:48:19.949 --> 00:48:23.490]  I will tell you, folks, that behind the scenes, he knows a lot more than what he's saying.
[00:48:24.131 --> 00:48:28.653]  He did call for blasting people in pools of blood if they come for his guns.
[00:48:29.373 --> 00:48:33.494]  We had the former head of the Treasury, the father of Reaganomics, Wall Street Journal editor on a few days ago.
[00:48:33.514 --> 00:48:36.456]  In fact, I'm going to play that coming up later, John.
[00:48:36.476 --> 00:48:37.076]  I forgot to do that.
[00:48:37.096 --> 00:48:43.338]  It was right at the end of his interview with us, what was it, Friday, that sent shockwaves when he said, attack police, overturn police cars.
[00:48:43.719 --> 00:48:45.219]  I mean, I'm not even calling for that.
[00:48:45.499 --> 00:48:47.560]  But people are getting sick of it, folks.
[00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:49.301]  Even Ted Nugent, who's a cop,
[00:48:49.961 --> 00:48:51.663]  I mean, he's telling you he's getting sick of it.
[00:48:51.923 --> 00:48:55.446]  We can all argue about minutiae, but it's gone too far.
[00:48:55.946 --> 00:49:01.531]  And I think that the answer to 1984 is 1776, be that an info war or whatever it is.
[00:49:01.711 --> 00:49:06.755]  Look, I've been around enough, I've seen enough to not be into violence.
[00:49:06.835 --> 00:49:08.756]  I'm not like a 15-year-old that thinks it's cool.
[00:49:09.477 --> 00:49:20.940]  You know, I understand how serious it is, and I'm not calling for it, but a spirit of that is rising, because the spirit of tyranny is rising, and when tyranny rises, liberty rises to meet it.
[00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:23.281]  For every action, there's an equal reaction.
[00:49:23.341 --> 00:49:26.902]  It's a simple law of quantum mechanics and physics.
[00:49:27.422 --> 00:49:30.463]  So I think this, taking us out to break, says it all.
[00:49:30.523 --> 00:49:31.843]  We have to get mad!
[00:49:32.263 --> 00:49:34.224]  We have to get angry first,
[00:49:34.804 --> 00:49:41.808]  And then take action, just getting a buzz going, speaking out, saying no, getting aggressive, waking others up, and making it fun to fight tyranny.
[00:49:41.988 --> 00:49:45.930]  We got a former congressman coming on about the martial law takeover grid.
[00:49:46.131 --> 00:49:47.431]  Powerful info.
[00:49:47.892 --> 00:49:51.334]  Straight ahead after this break, I leave you with Mattis Hill.
[00:49:52.134 --> 00:49:53.575]  I don't have to tell you things are bad.
[00:49:54.055 --> 00:49:55.216]  Everybody knows things are bad.
[00:49:55.836 --> 00:49:56.597]  It's a depression.
[00:49:57.777 --> 00:50:00.659]  Everybody's out of work, or scared of losing their job.
[00:50:02.048 --> 00:50:03.590]  The dollar buys a nickel's worth.
[00:50:04.050 --> 00:50:05.091]  Banks are going bust.
[00:50:05.151 --> 00:50:07.074]  Shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter.
[00:50:07.694 --> 00:50:09.276]  Punks are running wild in the street.
[00:50:09.316 --> 00:50:11.899]  There's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do and there's no end to it.
[00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:15.963]  We know the air is unfit to breathe.
[00:50:16.063 --> 00:50:17.445]  Our food is unfit to eat.
[00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:26.765]  We sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had 15 homicides and 63 violent crimes, as if that's the way it's supposed to be.
[00:50:27.045 --> 00:50:29.106]  We know things are bad, worse than bad.
[00:50:29.707 --> 00:50:30.427]  They're crazy.
[00:50:30.667 --> 00:50:33.669]  It's like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don't go out anymore.
[00:50:34.049 --> 00:50:40.973]  We sit in the house and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller and all we say is, please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms.
[00:50:41.013 --> 00:50:45.355]  Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radios and I won't say anything.
[00:50:45.576 --> 00:50:46.396]  Just leave us alone.
[00:50:46.636 --> 00:50:47.957]  Well, I'm not gonna leave you alone.
[00:50:48.875 --> 00:50:50.016]  I want you to get mad!
[00:50:50.036 --> 00:50:52.137]  I don't want you to protest.
[00:50:52.238 --> 00:50:53.258]  I don't want you to riot.
[00:50:53.278 --> 00:50:56.220]  I don't want you to write to your congressman because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write.
[00:50:56.601 --> 00:51:00.904]  I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street.
[00:51:01.244 --> 00:51:03.766]  All I know is that first, you've got to get mad!
[00:51:04.226 --> 00:51:06.108]  You've got to say, I'm a human being!
[00:51:06.348 --> 00:51:07.549]  My life has value!
[00:51:09.150 --> 00:51:11.752]  I want you to get up now.
[00:51:12.612 --> 00:51:14.714]  I want all of you to get up out of your chairs.
[00:51:15.891 --> 00:51:26.156]  I want you to get up right now and go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell, I'm as bad as hell and I'm not gonna take this anymore!
[00:51:26.256 --> 00:51:29.017]  I want you to get up right now.
[00:51:29.718 --> 00:51:40.103]  Get up, go to your windows, open them and stick your head out and yell, I'm as bad as hell and I'm not gonna take this anymore!
[00:51:48.216 --> 00:51:52.288]  I'm as fine as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!
[00:52:51.289 --> 00:52:53.810]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:55.430]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[00:52:55.710 --> 00:52:57.690]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:52:57.870 --> 00:52:59.611]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:52:59.771 --> 00:53:01.011]  The late, great USA.
[00:53:01.251 --> 00:53:02.671]  America, freedom to fascism.
[00:53:03.011 --> 00:53:09.853]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.
