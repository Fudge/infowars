[00:00:06.016 --> 00:00:06.697]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.337 --> 00:00:08.378]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:10.199]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:11.681]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.441 --> 00:00:13.342]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:17.725]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.186 --> 00:00:22.309]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:24.471]  Music
[00:00:34.014 --> 00:00:35.374]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:35.454 --> 00:00:35.855]  Welcome.
[00:00:35.915 --> 00:00:38.295]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:38.435 --> 00:00:41.796]  It is the 21st day of January 2008.
[00:00:41.896 --> 00:00:48.238]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours and 59 minutes, 15 seconds.
[00:00:48.938 --> 00:01:00.981]  No guests today because I want to give everybody a chance to call in about the hundreds of big issues it faces, but none of them bigger than the mainstream media and the culture controllers admitting...
[00:01:01.838 --> 00:01:05.620]  That the unraveling and imploding of the economy has begun.
[00:01:06.041 --> 00:01:09.723]  Within the space of two weeks, they have now admitted that we are in a recession.
[00:01:10.623 --> 00:01:13.185]  And they are now even talking about depression.
[00:01:13.345 --> 00:01:15.226]  That is all over the news.
[00:01:16.447 --> 00:01:26.413]  This is very, very serious that they are admitting it and that they are talking about it deepening and calling it, quote, and this is the little byline they're pushing, quote,
[00:01:27.313 --> 00:01:33.597]  The worst economic crises we have faced since the Great Depression that started in 1929.
[00:01:33.657 --> 00:01:37.199]  We are seeing that on CNN, Fox, the McLaughlin Group.
[00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.761]  We're seeing that in the financial papers.
[00:01:40.822 --> 00:01:56.572]  I have been saying for years that by 2008, our expert guests have been saying that by 2008, people like Joseph Stiklitz, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, and we're talking top economists in the world, that the major crises begin
[00:01:57.393 --> 00:01:57.894]  No, we don't know.
[00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:24.583]  But it is being orchestrated from the highest levels of the banking complex that owns and controls the media complex, the military industrial complex.
[00:02:24.963 --> 00:02:27.464]  They're behind schedule with their control grid.
[00:02:28.425 --> 00:02:35.868]  They wanted to have it fully in place before they squeezed and squeezed until our eyeballs financially pop out of our heads.
[00:02:36.368 --> 00:02:41.870]  But it looks like they're going ahead with the mass sharing down to the bone.
[00:02:42.985 --> 00:02:43.686]  We're good to go.
[00:02:43.706 --> 00:02:44.526]  We're good to go.
[00:03:08.755 --> 00:03:17.783]  And we talk about how they engineered this operation and how they were planning to do it in the United States in the next six years.
[00:03:19.084 --> 00:03:20.785]  I published that book in 2002.
[00:03:20.825 --> 00:03:21.025]  Again.
[00:03:25.186 --> 00:03:29.050]  I am not here bragging, saying, oh, we're so accurate, oh, we're so smart.
[00:03:29.611 --> 00:03:32.954]  It's not hard when you have the actual IMF World Bank documents.
[00:03:33.394 --> 00:03:35.797]  It's not hard when you have spies inside Bilderberg.
[00:03:36.157 --> 00:03:42.363]  It's not hard when you can read the Financial Times of London a year ago, two years ago, admitting what they were going to do.
[00:03:42.524 --> 00:03:43.885]  It's not hard.
[00:03:44.637 --> 00:03:45.197]  We're good to go.
[00:03:56.164 --> 00:04:05.831]  Because with a world this complex and this large with this many interactions, their most secretive plans manifest in their day-to-day operations.
[00:04:05.871 --> 00:04:25.384]  And you can assess and watch what they're doing just to confirm that they are indeed carrying out the operations you get from their public white papers that are academic, so they're semi-secret, and that the public doesn't even know what an academic or industry analysis paper or what an RFID symposium
[00:04:25.384 --> 00:04:26.024]  We're good to go.
[00:04:45.516 --> 00:04:51.999]  Openly discuss abject poverty and control with social workers and spies ruling over us.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.781]  We'll break it all down on the other side.
[00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:56.142]  Strap yourselves in.
[00:04:56.162 --> 00:04:58.143]  You're on the front lines of the Infowar.

[00:05:56.149 --> 00:06:00.690]  HerbalHealer.com Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.410]  It is a big idea.
[00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.511]  A new world order.
[00:06:06.275 --> 00:06:11.459]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:12.940]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.242]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[00:06:16.782 --> 00:06:19.224]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:06:19.964 --> 00:06:27.390]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:06:30.312 --> 00:06:35.275]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:06:35.755 --> 00:06:37.396]  Most people have no idea.
[00:06:37.436 --> 00:06:39.217]  They're not after money.
[00:06:39.617 --> 00:06:41.338]  They have all the money they need.
[00:06:41.378 --> 00:06:42.638]  They're after power.
[00:06:42.678 --> 00:06:44.099]  That's what they're after usually.
[00:07:00.928 --> 00:07:06.590]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH balanced alkaline environment.
[00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:11.912]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[00:07:12.192 --> 00:07:17.273]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[00:07:17.573 --> 00:07:19.354]  People who alkalize the water they drink
[00:07:19.594 --> 00:07:23.156]  Experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[00:07:23.476 --> 00:07:29.459]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:33.241]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[00:07:33.481 --> 00:07:38.023]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[00:07:38.323 --> 00:07:39.084]  Do your part.
[00:07:39.364 --> 00:07:41.625]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[00:07:41.985 --> 00:07:48.108]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink
[00:07:48.408 --> 00:07:49.329]  Again, that's AlkaVision.com.
[00:08:06.241 --> 00:08:06.881]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.542 --> 00:08:08.642]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:10.423]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:11.083 --> 00:08:11.904]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.644 --> 00:08:13.584]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.604 --> 00:08:18.106]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.407 --> 00:08:22.528]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:28.311 --> 00:08:34.814]  The long debilitation of the United States as a constitutional republic is now coming to an end.
[00:08:36.602 --> 00:08:43.527]  The absorption into the global military industrial banking pharma complex is now accelerating.
[00:08:44.487 --> 00:08:48.230]  The subdividing and death of the country is now beginning.
[00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:58.297]  The official dismemberment and subdividing, the rendering, literally the country is hung up by its hind legs in a slaughterhouse.
[00:08:58.817 --> 00:09:03.861]  The throat has been slit, the blood has poured out, and they are now gutting us.
[00:09:05.117 --> 00:09:09.120]  The awful is spilling out all over the slaughterhouse floor.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.944]  A gaggle of greedy parasites are rubbing their hands together feverishly.
[00:09:14.964 --> 00:09:27.372]  The millions of ticks and parasites swarming over the skin of the hide are sucking up the last bits of sustenance.
[00:09:28.212 --> 00:09:30.494]  They're all going to be cut out of the deal in the near future.
[00:09:31.955 --> 00:09:41.204]  And the public is mindlessly watching reality TV, gibbering like a huge pack of rhesus monkeys.
[00:09:42.966 --> 00:09:45.848]  And that basically is the picture.
[00:09:45.908 --> 00:09:48.130]  That basically is the situation.
[00:09:50.473 --> 00:09:51.754]  I know it's a grim picture.
[00:09:52.825 --> 00:09:59.309]  But we need to just be honest about the fact that the country has been totally dominated, totally overrun from every angle.
[00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:01.971]  Systematically, it was the big prize.
[00:10:02.491 --> 00:10:21.324]  A long-term, 80-plus year intelligence operation of psychological warfare, brainwashing, dumbing down, mass poisoning, genetic engineering, genetic warfare, biological warfare, chemical warfare, just absolute cunning, scientific minds,
[00:10:22.074 --> 00:10:35.227]  Who are not only unfeeling, contrary, are feeling and enjoy the predatory delight, the blood sport, just like a pack of wolves won't just kill two or three sheep, domesticated sheep of their left to it.
[00:10:35.247 --> 00:10:41.353]  They'll kill 10, 20, 30, 40 just in enjoyment, ripping one throat out after another.
[00:10:42.791 --> 00:10:44.853]  Hell is now being released.
[00:10:45.333 --> 00:10:55.481]  This is only the beginning as the literal forces of hell prepare to have a blood feast, the likes of which we saw in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany.
[00:10:57.703 --> 00:11:01.767]  Now, I am not mincing words here, and I am not joking around.
[00:11:04.369 --> 00:11:10.674]  This is the reality of what the New World Order has in store for this nation and for the planet.
[00:11:11.491 --> 00:11:12.891]  There are chances to slow it.
[00:11:12.911 --> 00:11:14.472]  There are chances to even stop it.
[00:11:15.012 --> 00:11:23.494]  But first, we have to have a massive societal, a massive species awakening to the threat.
[00:11:23.654 --> 00:11:37.157]  Everything has been done to incrementally make you cynical, to incrementally prepare you and acclimatize incrementally, to condition you to accept
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:44.966]  The deepening shadows that are now enveloping not just the United States, but the world.
[00:11:47.548 --> 00:11:56.256]  Before I take your calls, get into the economic news, the latest election news, the Ron Paul news, the war news, all of it today, because I'm fired up.
[00:11:59.379 --> 00:12:02.522]  Let me just give you an example of driving in to work this morning.
[00:12:04.679 --> 00:12:10.160]  I like to flip around between news channels, and then I'll also flip over, because I was driving my wife's car today.
[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:14.581]  She's got XM, and I was listening to NPR on XM.
[00:12:17.502 --> 00:12:18.182]  Why does it matter?
[00:12:18.222 --> 00:12:19.162]  Why do I give you that detail?
[00:12:19.222 --> 00:12:19.762]  It doesn't matter.
[00:12:19.782 --> 00:12:31.945]  The point is, I was listening to the radio, and I flipped to one channel, and they were announcing new college scholarships for
[00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:37.594]  To be police officers and scholarships in security and anti-terrorism.
[00:12:38.074 --> 00:12:39.836]  And that was out of a Dallas radio station.
[00:12:41.277 --> 00:12:48.323]  And then I flipped over to NPR Culture Shocks, and they're merging basically with the BBC.
[00:12:48.363 --> 00:12:50.305]  It's a BBC report on NPR.
[00:12:51.185 --> 00:12:53.968]  And I thought, oh good, something to get my mind off of New World Order.
[00:12:54.368 --> 00:13:01.054]  They're talking about MP3 players and how their sound quality isn't as good as the vinyl, but why people societally like them, and
[00:13:01.733 --> 00:13:07.136]  How CDs are even old hat that people are collecting them now as a fetishizing them.
[00:13:08.377 --> 00:13:11.639]  And I'm thinking, oh good, I get to escape propaganda for a few minutes.
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:21.845]  And then they went into a James Bond report about a car maker making a James Bond style car that will drive right into the lake and be a submarine.
[00:13:23.766 --> 00:13:26.848]  And then they, so it's just mindless nonsense report.
[00:13:27.925 --> 00:13:56.120]  And then they switch over, again, they put it all together by design, and they switch over into, oh, by the way, in England at colleges, for kids that want to be like James Bond, they're training them in radar devices that are handheld to look through your walls, encryption, how to spy on people, and how the new scholarships and funding all over England are how to create James Bond spies to domestically track and trace and watch everyone.
[00:13:57.122 --> 00:14:03.148]  Now, folks, I was listening in a 20-minute drive to two different shows.
[00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:07.813]  One out of Dallas, one off of NPR.
[00:14:09.535 --> 00:14:14.320]  There is a huge, and I keep talking about this because it's a big deal, there is a shift.
[00:14:15.601 --> 00:14:17.343]  Of course, there aren't any real terrorists.
[00:14:17.723 --> 00:14:20.466]  Even if you believe in them, it's extremely rare and
[00:14:21.623 --> 00:14:28.330]  You'll probably see a tooth fairy or a hobgoblin before you actually see a terrorist or see a terrorist event or are hurt by one.
[00:14:29.371 --> 00:14:29.891]  They don't care.
[00:14:30.672 --> 00:14:41.122]  This is the entire excuse for the military-industrial complex to go in and take about 10% of the new college graduates, and we're now five years into this program.
[00:14:41.142 --> 00:14:45.787]  I mean, we're talking more than a million a year.
[00:14:47.051 --> 00:14:57.417]  Who are going to be cops, who are going to be spies, who are going to be domestic commissars, who are going to be internet spy technicians, who are going to be technicians that look through your walls.
[00:14:57.517 --> 00:15:08.483]  I mean, this is one of the largest areas, one of the largest new disciplines in the entire, quote, you know, education workforce complex.
[00:15:09.853 --> 00:15:11.754]  Millions and millions and millions.
[00:15:12.175 --> 00:15:24.522]  And as the years go on, more and more professors, more and more classes, more and more schools, more and more chairs, more and more sections of community colleges, four-year institutions, elite institutions.
[00:15:25.302 --> 00:15:26.923]  It is a total shift.
[00:15:26.963 --> 00:15:31.866]  I mean, all of spookdom came out of Yale and Harvard and Princeton.
[00:15:33.047 --> 00:15:35.549]  From the 40s and the OSS right through into the 80s.
[00:15:36.474 --> 00:15:36.935]  We're good to go.
[00:15:53.972 --> 00:15:57.814]  Every major community college in Tennessee is setting up programs, turning them out.
[00:15:58.234 --> 00:16:00.736]  We have the director of that, converting them over.
[00:16:01.056 --> 00:16:03.077]  We're not talking about computer programming.
[00:16:03.097 --> 00:16:04.798]  We're not talking about electrical engineering.
[00:16:05.118 --> 00:16:07.639]  We're not talking about product engineering.
[00:16:07.679 --> 00:16:10.341]  We're not talking about environmental sciences.
[00:16:10.741 --> 00:16:17.465]  We're not talking about literature, theater, language, arts, history.
[00:16:17.745 --> 00:16:19.806]  Uh-uh, baby, you don't need to know that.
[00:16:20.507 --> 00:16:28.731]  You need to know how to be a secret agent, man.
[00:16:29.171 --> 00:16:33.173]  But he's not going to be out fighting Dr. No or Chaos.
[00:16:33.933 --> 00:16:40.096]  They're not going to be out fighting those imaginary guys at the underground volcano base in the Pacific.
[00:16:40.794 --> 00:16:56.268]  They're going to be looking over your fence, flying over in helicopters scanning you, dispatching platoons of armored stormtroopers in literal Darth Vader outfits to gun you and your family down, to drag you off the FEMA centers.
[00:16:56.288 --> 00:17:03.734]  They've already recruited in three years, mainstream news, years after we told you, 26,000 preachers to be doubled again to 50-plus preachers
[00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:10.091]  52,000 preachers.
[00:17:10.111 --> 00:17:12.093]  52,000 preachers in 2008.
[00:17:12.593 --> 00:17:15.375]  Already 26,000 in 2007.
[00:17:16.636 --> 00:17:19.739]  Giving sermons about surrendering to government.
[00:17:19.879 --> 00:17:21.080]  Submitting to government.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.261]  Handing in your guns.
[00:17:23.361 --> 00:17:24.622]  Going to FEMA camps.
[00:17:24.702 --> 00:17:26.364]  Taking forced inoculations.
[00:17:26.444 --> 00:17:27.985]  Letting them break up your families.
[00:17:29.426 --> 00:17:35.751]  Do you realize the organized, massive, huge, wartime... It's World War II scaled.
[00:17:36.534 --> 00:17:38.395]  I mean, it's a huge build-up.
[00:17:38.535 --> 00:17:40.556]  It's all the stops pulled out.
[00:17:40.676 --> 00:17:41.676]  Everything removed.
[00:17:42.036 --> 00:17:43.277]  Total propaganda.
[00:17:43.317 --> 00:17:44.898]  Got a thumbprint to have a job.
[00:17:45.178 --> 00:17:46.558]  Got a face can to have a job.
[00:17:46.578 --> 00:17:49.280]  As Homeland Security said, all jobs are going to have to have this soon.
[00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:50.740]  Selectively enforced.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:55.002]  Illegal aliens, selectively enforced, don't have to do any of it.
[00:17:55.923 --> 00:18:00.625]  Mexican government to spend tens of millions in concerted effort with the U.S.
[00:18:00.665 --> 00:18:01.765]  government and corporations.
[00:18:01.845 --> 00:18:03.146]  Now reported on CNN.
[00:18:03.166 --> 00:18:04.366]  I forgot to send that to you.
[00:18:05.207 --> 00:18:05.847]  Just Google it.
[00:18:06.483 --> 00:18:11.004]  Mexican government, John, to... I forget the exact headline.
[00:18:11.044 --> 00:18:12.284]  It was on Truth News yesterday.
[00:18:12.344 --> 00:18:14.085]  I played it on the KLBJ Show, a clip of it.
[00:18:14.445 --> 00:18:15.345]  I'm going to play it here again.
[00:18:15.365 --> 00:18:16.785]  I mean, we already told you this years ago.
[00:18:17.126 --> 00:18:24.247]  Rob Allen & Co., the White House, Vicente Fox, tens of millions two years ago and last year with illegal alien demonstrations everywhere.
[00:18:24.667 --> 00:18:31.329]  They had big paid-for trucks handing out American flags, but the illegals refused most of the time and pulled out Mexican flags so it backfired.
[00:18:32.009 --> 00:18:32.989]  Now, that's the good news.
[00:18:33.009 --> 00:18:34.670]  A lot of these black ops aren't working.
[00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:46.073]  But, I mean, you need to realize, you know, tens of billions of dollars for fake news, buying off reporters, 1.8 bill in one program, just absolute pulling out the stops.
[00:18:47.013 --> 00:18:48.534]  But you listen to that NPR piece.
[00:18:49.794 --> 00:18:51.394]  It was all scientifically crafted.
[00:18:52.195 --> 00:18:54.235]  George Arwell wrote about that when he was at BBC.
[00:18:54.275 --> 00:18:57.036]  That character is him, Winston, at the Ministry of Truth.
[00:18:57.956 --> 00:19:00.537]  He wrote in letters and books that, well, that was reality.
[00:19:00.657 --> 00:19:03.978]  What he wrote in that book was what it was like at the BBC to be Winston.
[00:19:04.178 --> 00:19:06.198]  So it was actually a BBC piece on NPR.
[00:19:07.318 --> 00:19:13.640]  They just mixed it in very calmly in little happy pieces about MP3 players and James Bond cars.
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:21.222]  Oh, by the way, we're converting over to teach everybody in their first year education just a basic course.
[00:19:21.802 --> 00:19:25.323]  No longer is it basic math or algebra when you get into college.
[00:19:26.354 --> 00:19:28.656]  No longer is it History 101.
[00:19:29.177 --> 00:19:39.287]  No, now we're shifting directly over into spying, looking through walls, tracking, reading people's emails, surveilling, running the grids.
[00:19:39.307 --> 00:19:42.831]  You see, they mixed it in calmly.
[00:19:43.912 --> 00:19:46.555]  They mixed it in happily.
[00:19:47.228 --> 00:19:58.157]  They just brought it in what was comfortable, easing you into the warm water as they turn up the fires beneath it and bring it up to a full boil.
[00:19:58.637 --> 00:20:00.118]  We'll be right back with your call.
[00:20:00.139 --> 00:20:00.559]  Stay with me.
[00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:05.051]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:05.671 --> 00:20:14.595]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:15.055 --> 00:20:22.238]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:22.978 --> 00:20:28.463]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with Lacemed Ink's patented methodology.
[00:20:28.943 --> 00:20:39.772]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:40.533 --> 00:20:42.615]  Laser technology at its best.

[00:20:57.005 --> 00:20:58.025]  Call 702-953-0267.
[00:20:58.426 --> 00:21:03.549]  It is a big idea.
[00:21:03.569 --> 00:21:05.650]  A new world order.
[00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:10.593]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by our world government.
[00:21:11.253 --> 00:21:14.055]  It's known as the Builder Earth.
[00:21:14.075 --> 00:21:16.276]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:21:16.863 --> 00:21:19.285]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:21:20.025 --> 00:21:27.350]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:21:30.385 --> 00:21:35.368]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:21:35.849 --> 00:21:39.311]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:21:39.691 --> 00:21:42.213]  Bill Burr is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:21:42.273 --> 00:21:43.414]  Most people have no idea.
[00:21:43.454 --> 00:21:44.194]  They're not after money.
[00:21:44.214 --> 00:21:45.275]  They have all the money they need.
[00:21:45.495 --> 00:21:46.236]  They're after power.
[00:21:46.456 --> 00:21:47.496]  That's what I have to use you for.

[00:24:29.927 --> 00:24:44.580]  Go tell that long-tongued liar Go and tell that midnight rider Tell the rambler, the gambler, the backbiter Tell them that God's gonna cut them down Tell them that God's gonna cut them down
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:52.441]  Well, my goodness gracious, let me tell you the news.
[00:24:52.821 --> 00:24:55.381]  My head's been wet with the midnight dew.
[00:24:56.002 --> 00:25:01.183]  I've been down on bended knee, talking to the man from Galilee.
[00:25:01.483 --> 00:25:07.064]  He spoke to me with a voice so sweet, I thought I heard the shuffle of angels.
[00:25:07.444 --> 00:25:10.025]  He called my name and my heart stood still.
[00:25:10.405 --> 00:25:15.086]  When he said, John, go do my will, don't tell that long-tongued liar.
[00:25:16.367 --> 00:25:25.133]  All right, we're going to go to your calls now.
[00:25:25.153 --> 00:25:32.858]  I just want to finish up with that rant in the last segment by saying that they don't need a free market anymore.
[00:25:33.556 --> 00:25:34.036]  We're good to go.
[00:25:58.912 --> 00:26:04.915]  And so now that 20% or so of the wealth that's still in people's hands, that's going to be brutally transferred now.
[00:26:05.796 --> 00:26:10.018]  As we accelerate the incremental slide into abject despotism.
[00:26:11.239 --> 00:26:13.520]  And the entire economy is being absorbed.
[00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:14.541]  It's being shifted.
[00:26:15.761 --> 00:26:17.102]  And I mean, it's just going to be hellish.
[00:26:17.122 --> 00:26:22.485]  Can you imagine all these college grads and they've gone to a four-year program, a two-year program, a six-year program.
[00:26:23.566 --> 00:26:25.807]  They've been trained, brainwashed, prepared.
[00:26:26.718 --> 00:26:32.757]  At these colleges to spy, to look through your walls, to track what you're doing, to run the databases...
[00:26:33.504 --> 00:26:56.843]  And then, of course, there's a whole other branch of the exploding social workers to oversee all the new environmental laws and inspect your home, and you've got too many children to put extra taxes on you and to regulate you, and anybody who even raises a couple chickens or a couple cows, you've got to report everything and signing over your land through these deals, and you just thought it was registering your property.
[00:26:57.404 --> 00:27:00.106]  I mean, they're hitting us from every angle.
[00:27:01.467 --> 00:27:02.468]  It's happening now.
[00:27:03.331 --> 00:27:04.112]  Feudalism.
[00:27:04.252 --> 00:27:04.732]  Serfdom.
[00:27:05.833 --> 00:27:07.374]  They are moving like never before.
[00:27:07.414 --> 00:27:08.474]  Now, we can discredit it.
[00:27:09.735 --> 00:27:10.716]  We can expose it.
[00:27:11.296 --> 00:27:24.825]  Greater minds than mine can go research this, write it up, succinctly explain to people the overall wide-specrum grid, and then ask those that can still think, do you want to be part of this?
[00:27:25.306 --> 00:27:27.607]  And they'll say, okay, I don't want to be part of it, but what do I do?
[00:27:28.027 --> 00:27:28.908]  You say no to it.
[00:27:29.443 --> 00:27:30.323]  You go to the colleges.
[00:27:30.363 --> 00:27:31.424]  You talk to the young people.
[00:27:31.804 --> 00:27:33.825]  People in the colleges fight back against it.
[00:27:34.125 --> 00:27:36.086]  There's a lot of people in the colleges that see what's happening.
[00:27:36.106 --> 00:27:41.548]  The professors and the academia and the researchers and the scholars.
[00:27:42.369 --> 00:27:43.930]  I mean, I'm not the only one seeing this.
[00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:45.150]  This is serious.
[00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:53.854]  This is a slow motion, incremental, very calculated overthrow completely of society, of all of our rights and liberties.
[00:27:55.335 --> 00:27:56.535]  Let's go to Robert in Texas.
[00:27:56.595 --> 00:27:57.996]  Robert, your first caller of the day.
[00:27:58.036 --> 00:27:58.356]  Welcome.
[00:28:02.443 --> 00:28:03.324]  Okay, we'll let him go.
[00:28:03.484 --> 00:28:05.447]  Stephen in Chicago, you're on the air.
[00:28:07.029 --> 00:28:17.002]  Yes, Alex, did you get a chance to see the corruption article about Obama being linked to a campaign abuse scandal?
[00:28:18.542 --> 00:28:22.465]  Sir, I mean, they're all as corrupt as it gets.
[00:28:22.545 --> 00:28:29.330]  Anybody the media is saying is good is part of the corrupt system, and they have to have corruption on them to even let them be prominent.
[00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:36.535]  That's how they control them, so that the media, owned by the military-industrial complex, owned by the private central banks, can destroy them whenever they want.
[00:28:36.555 --> 00:28:38.297]  That's why they love McCain.
[00:28:38.697 --> 00:28:41.739]  Mafia-connected, Keating Five, totally evil.
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:43.140]  Right.
[00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:45.542]  This is a 78-page evidentiary, Proffer.
[00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:49.092]  And he's alluded to as an unnamed political candidate.
[00:28:49.432 --> 00:28:55.536]  The Sun-Times investigative reporter double-checked with the feds, and they say that that's who it is.
[00:28:55.916 --> 00:28:58.177]  But the trial's supposed to come up February 25th.
[00:28:58.918 --> 00:29:11.985]  One of the allegations is that one of the contributors pulled a shoe type of thing where he told somebody to give money to campaign like a shoe did to Hillary Clinton, and then he reimbursed them, which is a federal violation.
[00:29:12.265 --> 00:29:13.486]  But there are other allegations.
[00:29:13.506 --> 00:29:15.227]  There are other allegations there was a kickback.
[00:29:16.591 --> 00:29:30.056]  We're a $250,000 school pension, state of Illinois program, and in order to participate with your company, you had to contribute... Hold on a second, Steve.
[00:29:30.477 --> 00:29:32.958]  What's the headline on that story in the Chicago Sun?
[00:29:33.838 --> 00:29:34.338]  Sometimes.
[00:29:34.418 --> 00:29:41.521]  It was yesterday's, and it's called, Obama Surfaces in Resco's Federal Corruption Case.
[00:29:42.119 --> 00:29:42.619]  Stay there.
[00:29:42.659 --> 00:29:44.400]  Let's talk more about it on the other side.
[00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:47.922]  We'll try to get that up on prisonplanet.com or jonesreport.com.
[00:29:48.342 --> 00:29:48.922]  Stay with me.
[00:29:52.064 --> 00:29:52.984]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.464 --> 00:29:55.065]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.986 --> 00:29:58.687]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.463 --> 00:30:06.185]  This is George Whitehurst-Berry of the Genesis Communications Network.
[00:30:06.425 --> 00:30:08.706]  Have you ever wanted the truth about the economy?
[00:30:09.006 --> 00:30:09.466]  Crash!

[00:32:38.674 --> 00:32:40.854]  Or mail in your order to us at 4425 Schneider Road, Fillmore, NY 14735.
[00:32:52.157 --> 00:32:55.839]  The total cost for this massive package of information is only $10.
[00:32:55.879 --> 00:33:00.742]  $15 for UPS Ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[00:33:05.944 --> 00:33:09.946]  Tell the folks we're born, make the way to fly.
[00:33:24.878 --> 00:33:26.761]  We're good to go.
[00:33:36.867 --> 00:33:39.548]  I got the Daily Herald in front of me.
[00:33:39.568 --> 00:33:42.730]  Conference promotes global citizenship.
[00:34:03.633 --> 00:34:29.439]  Nationwide in our university, see a total shift, brainwashing, to the point of where your entire degree is about being a spy, being a social worker, being a tattletale, being a thug, being a black bag operator, being an assassin, being a global citizen, just to where that's the degrees they'll all have, and they've got a stake in it, and that's the end.
[00:34:30.942 --> 00:34:33.444]  Talking to Steve and Kyle, Paul, Bob, and others.
[00:34:34.284 --> 00:34:35.805]  Steve in Chicago.
[00:34:35.825 --> 00:34:39.147]  Yeah, we pulled up that Chicago Sun-Times report.
[00:34:39.607 --> 00:34:42.729]  You know, that could be Hillary or somebody else trying to burn Obama.
[00:34:43.369 --> 00:34:44.150]  It could be true.
[00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:45.731]  I mean, who knows?
[00:34:45.791 --> 00:34:49.533]  I mean, compared to Dyncor and Halliburton running giant child kidnapping rings, it really...
[00:34:50.436 --> 00:34:51.356]  I mean, it's just all of it.
[00:34:51.376 --> 00:34:52.196]  It's just corruption.
[00:34:52.757 --> 00:34:58.338]  And a lot of the ways that they do the campaign finance laws, it's hard to even follow them properly.
[00:34:58.378 --> 00:35:02.859]  Hillary's allowed to have all these corrupt Chinese mafia people give her money, but that's okay.
[00:35:02.879 --> 00:35:05.460]  And then Barack Obama will get in trouble for something else.
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:07.300]  I have no doubt the guy's corrupt.
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:14.042]  I mean, anybody at that level is, because the system won't even make you a big player unless they've already, again, got enough dirt on you to destroy you with the drop of a hat.
[00:35:15.226 --> 00:35:17.287]  From inside, just one button I push.
[00:35:17.367 --> 00:35:18.748]  It's over for you, as they say.
[00:35:19.469 --> 00:35:20.649]  But go ahead and make your points.
[00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:27.394]  Well, then you also saw the part about how he was working for this firm, Resmeyer.
[00:35:27.454 --> 00:35:28.914]  That's the name of the real estate firm.
[00:35:29.515 --> 00:35:31.836]  And he did legal work for them.
[00:35:32.096 --> 00:35:33.217]  I guess he did their titles.
[00:35:33.577 --> 00:35:41.262]  What they were is they were buying up slum properties, apartment complexes, getting HUD funds, rehabilitation funds, but not doing the work.
[00:35:41.282 --> 00:35:44.564]  As a matter of fact, it says there the tenants didn't have any heat.
[00:35:45.123 --> 00:35:47.145]  And then, of course, he claims he didn't know anything.
[00:35:47.505 --> 00:35:53.010]  Now, one last thing is that issue about his mansion on the south side by the University of Chicago campus.
[00:35:54.071 --> 00:35:55.912]  He was interested in the majority property.
[00:35:56.633 --> 00:36:01.317]  This one real estate developer bought it for him and then sold it to him for a song as a straw buyer.
[00:36:01.457 --> 00:36:04.440]  Well, that's one of the oldest forms of payoff.
[00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:09.064]  That's how they pay off local mayors and county commissioners in our town over the years.
[00:36:09.918 --> 00:36:10.599]  We're good to go.
[00:36:33.179 --> 00:36:33.860]  One last thing.
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:34.821]  He's a ticket scofflaw, too.
[00:36:34.841 --> 00:36:38.023]  $350 worth of tickets he never paid in Chicago, and then $250 when he was a Harvard Law student.
[00:37:01.488 --> 00:37:07.593]  Well, remember the report just a few years ago where hundreds of members of Congress just refused to pay income tax?
[00:37:08.414 --> 00:37:09.194]  Yeah, I remember that.
[00:37:09.354 --> 00:37:10.055]  That's the whole point.
[00:37:10.095 --> 00:37:21.384]  They just do whatever they want, and they've got hordes of brainwashed people, you know, hopped up on drugs and chemicals they've been drinking in the water their whole lives with machine guns who will kill whoever they're told.
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:23.300]  Right.
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.922]  I mean, what do you do when just total criminals run everything?
[00:37:26.182 --> 00:37:28.043]  They selectively enforce on all us.
[00:37:28.443 --> 00:37:30.864]  If we have a crooked toenail, they throw the book at patriots.
[00:37:31.265 --> 00:37:33.566]  Illegal aliens just running around doing whatever they want.
[00:37:33.866 --> 00:37:35.567]  It's just criminals run everything.
[00:37:36.508 --> 00:37:40.890]  I just paid a $55 seatbelt ticket, so I'm sorry about that.
[00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:45.153]  And if you don't pay that, they'll come arrest you at your house.
[00:37:45.773 --> 00:37:45.953]  Right.
[00:37:46.794 --> 00:37:49.175]  I know your situation on the North American Unionists.
[00:37:49.525 --> 00:37:53.327]  What is your situation about the Tory unionists in Britain?
[00:37:55.007 --> 00:37:56.108]  How do you feel about that?
[00:37:56.148 --> 00:37:57.288]  Are you a Scottish independent?
[00:37:57.328 --> 00:38:02.711]  Because they have an article in the Scotsman today how woefully ignorant the Scottish kids about Scottish history.
[00:38:03.031 --> 00:38:09.653]  They thought that Ramsay MacDonald, who was a First Labour Prime Minister from Scotland, they thought he invented the hamburger.
[00:38:10.574 --> 00:38:11.334]  Thanks for the call.
[00:38:12.575 --> 00:38:15.776]  Certainly, I am for Scotland and Ireland being fully independent.
[00:38:16.216 --> 00:38:17.697]  I'd like to go the other direction.
[00:38:18.457 --> 00:38:18.818]  Hello, Alex.
[00:38:18.858 --> 00:38:18.918]  Hi.
[00:38:42.876 --> 00:38:50.860]  I just want to say on record that I am one college student that's not going along with the Paranoid Security Society and I am studying electrical engineering.
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:53.041]  Good.
[00:38:53.061 --> 00:38:53.902]  Something very rare.
[00:38:54.162 --> 00:38:54.962]  Where do you go to school?
[00:38:55.723 --> 00:38:57.283]  I'm going to ACC right now.
[00:38:58.064 --> 00:39:03.206]  How many people in there are going to school to be social workers or cops or spies?
[00:39:04.507 --> 00:39:07.329]  I'm trying to think.
[00:39:07.389 --> 00:39:11.831]  I've talked about maybe 10-15% of the people who want to be social workers are those
[00:39:12.509 --> 00:39:13.050]  We're good to go.
[00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:13.330]  I think?
[00:39:24.406 --> 00:39:28.608]  But more than that, they don't see how they're compartmentalized and how it plays into the nanny society.
[00:39:28.628 --> 00:39:31.909]  Now, in some schools, more than 20% are going to be social workers.
[00:39:32.189 --> 00:39:38.992]  When I say 10% for Homeland Security, I mean 10% in the policing, spying apparatus alone.
[00:39:39.433 --> 00:39:45.495]  You start adding in all the rest of the government preparation degrees and the social working degrees, you're over half.
[00:39:46.396 --> 00:39:46.976]  Absolutely.
[00:39:46.996 --> 00:39:53.839]  And there's just another aspect of where I know the security society is hitting, even just people not making purchases,
[00:39:54.763 --> 00:40:00.666]  Real estate agents in the state of Texas now have to go and be fingerprinted in order to renew their license.
[00:40:01.267 --> 00:40:05.809]  I have my license, and I got my notice for renewal.
[00:40:06.069 --> 00:40:08.690]  It's like, oh, by the way, now you have to fingerprint everything.
[00:40:09.291 --> 00:40:11.692]  And, you know, we're talking about people like my age.
[00:40:11.892 --> 00:40:12.352]  I'm 21.
[00:40:12.652 --> 00:40:17.595]  And, by the way, I've confirmed they're giving letters to all the real estate agents, and it's color of law.
[00:40:17.955 --> 00:40:21.777]  The real estate law only says real estate agents who are also brokers.
[00:40:23.132 --> 00:40:23.512]  Really?
[00:40:23.592 --> 00:40:24.193]  I didn't know that.
[00:40:24.233 --> 00:40:25.614]  Yeah, it's all fraud, sir.
[00:40:25.674 --> 00:40:26.414]  That's how they do it.
[00:40:26.434 --> 00:40:28.736]  Do you have a source for that?
[00:40:28.756 --> 00:40:31.798]  Yeah, I have a friend who's a real estate agent and broker.
[00:40:31.858 --> 00:40:33.119]  They gave me a copy of it.
[00:40:33.379 --> 00:40:36.201]  I made a story a few weeks ago on it and actually pulled it up online.
[00:40:36.782 --> 00:40:37.883]  Just go look at the new law.
[00:40:37.943 --> 00:40:39.003]  Actually, go look at the regulations.
[00:40:40.276 --> 00:40:42.977]  It doesn't matter if only a few percentage points are actually brokers.
[00:40:43.037 --> 00:40:57.165]  Everyone will cattle up, and they're going to tell you if you actually ask at the place where you work or the place that generally most people work under, Umbrella Group, they'll just say, well, yeah, sure, it's not everybody since you asked, but we want you to.
[00:40:57.925 --> 00:41:02.307]  Yeah, because all real estate salespeople work underneath a broker.
[00:41:02.928 --> 00:41:03.548]  Yeah, so...
[00:41:04.264 --> 00:41:04.664]  Thank you.
[00:41:05.124 --> 00:41:07.085]  If I can find that, I'll bring that to me.
[00:41:07.425 --> 00:41:08.886]  It's all part of the fraud.
[00:41:08.906 --> 00:41:11.067]  Look, it's just constant lying and evil.
[00:41:11.647 --> 00:41:13.207]  And I know I keep saying that, folks.
[00:41:13.307 --> 00:41:15.568]  It's just total fraud.
[00:41:15.969 --> 00:41:18.149]  You have a public who cannot find the U.S.
[00:41:18.209 --> 00:41:22.251]  on a map, who doesn't know how many continents there are, who doesn't know who the vice president is.
[00:41:22.491 --> 00:41:23.691]  You're being gamed.
[00:41:23.892 --> 00:41:24.292]  Go ahead.
[00:41:25.332 --> 00:41:26.473]  Yeah, so, okay.
[00:41:26.593 --> 00:41:27.513]  Thank you for that information.
[00:41:27.533 --> 00:41:32.795]  But, you know, as far as what I'm doing, I'm staying electrical engineering.
[00:41:33.231 --> 00:41:34.311]  I stopped watching TV.
[00:41:34.391 --> 00:41:35.531]  I stopped playing video games.
[00:41:35.591 --> 00:41:36.472]  I'm trying to eat better.
[00:41:36.492 --> 00:41:37.872]  I'm trying to work out.
[00:41:37.992 --> 00:41:39.392]  I'm trying to learn martial arts.
[00:41:39.592 --> 00:41:42.173]  You stopped drinking the fluoride?
[00:41:42.293 --> 00:41:42.833]  Yes.
[00:41:43.513 --> 00:41:44.713]  I have a sport Berkey right now.
[00:41:44.733 --> 00:41:47.954]  It really doesn't take out the fluoride.
[00:41:48.294 --> 00:41:49.134]  It reduces it.
[00:41:49.774 --> 00:41:57.196]  I've been drinking out of a sport Berkey for a while, but I'm trying to convince my parents to buy a... I'm probably going to buy it myself.
[00:41:57.296 --> 00:41:58.796]  That's how you defeat them.
[00:41:59.993 --> 00:42:00.974]  Absolutely.
[00:42:01.214 --> 00:42:09.079]  I'm studying economics and I'm realizing I'm going to try to get all this paper fiat crap and actually get real silver.
[00:42:09.119 --> 00:42:14.243]  I think I talked to you about this before about how I'm studying banking as well and the interest rates.
[00:42:14.943 --> 00:42:17.745]  If everybody wants currency, you have to pay a price.
[00:42:17.765 --> 00:42:19.066]  You have to pay a higher interest rate.
[00:42:19.566 --> 00:42:22.548]  What the Fed does is they artificially lower the interest rate.
[00:42:22.949 --> 00:42:27.892]  They create a shortage of the money supply so they go off and print more causing dollar devaluations.
[00:42:28.792 --> 00:42:29.293]  Absolutely.
[00:42:29.313 --> 00:42:31.257]  I appreciate you calling in, my friend.
[00:42:31.718 --> 00:42:32.720]  Bob in Arizona.
[00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:33.622]  You're on the air, Bob.
[00:42:35.245 --> 00:42:35.526]  Yes.
[00:42:35.987 --> 00:42:36.548]  Yes, hello?
[00:42:36.748 --> 00:42:37.009]  Hi.
[00:42:37.871 --> 00:42:38.833]  Yes, good morning, Alex.
[00:42:39.033 --> 00:42:39.414]  Good morning.
[00:42:39.969 --> 00:42:42.952]  Yes, I was wondering, have you heard anything lately about Dr. Paul?
[00:42:43.012 --> 00:42:48.296]  It seems like all these other candidates are getting all the attention and just pretty much burying him.
[00:42:48.316 --> 00:43:01.407]  Yeah, they ignored the fact that he got second place in Arizona, and CNN and Fox would show that McCain was second place and wouldn't even show Paul because, you see, they tied, and they don't care.
[00:43:01.427 --> 00:43:03.589]  It doesn't matter if he got second place.
[00:43:03.649 --> 00:43:05.731]  They just don't show him, and that's how they operate.
[00:43:07.253 --> 00:43:10.794]  Do you know when this time he's going to be on television by any chance?
[00:43:11.854 --> 00:43:12.794]  No, I haven't.
[00:43:12.814 --> 00:43:17.695]  I mean, I've been tracking the news and the campaign, but, I mean, he's on TV here and there.
[00:43:17.755 --> 00:43:30.157]  But, I mean, Giuliani, he's beat Giuliani now in all of these primaries, but they keep giving Giuliani as much attention as any of the other, you know, Mitt Romney or Keating 5 McCain.
[00:43:31.537 --> 00:43:34.438]  And it's just clear censorship.
[00:43:34.498 --> 00:43:36.518]  Digg got caught last week.
[00:43:37.616 --> 00:43:39.777]  Openly censoring all Ron Paul stories.
[00:43:40.797 --> 00:43:42.338]  I mean, this is just how they operate.
[00:43:43.319 --> 00:43:51.102]  Yeah, down in the town that I live in, south of Tucson, they were putting up signs for Ron Paul people, and they were tearing them down almost as fast as they were putting them up.
[00:43:51.362 --> 00:43:51.822]  That's right.
[00:43:52.122 --> 00:43:58.645]  I drove to Dallas this weekend or Thursday to work on a JFK movie, and...
[00:43:59.432 --> 00:44:07.074]  The whole way I saw Ron Paul signs, Ron Paul bumper stickers on cars, saw no other political signs or stickers that weren't local candidates.
[00:44:07.114 --> 00:44:07.914]  I saw some local.
[00:44:09.094 --> 00:44:19.077]  And people say all over the country they see that too, but magically, you know, he's 10, 15 points at the polls, and magically he doesn't get more than 10% at the actual polls, and it's complete fraud, and we all know that.
[00:44:20.677 --> 00:44:23.158]  Well, we'll just have to keep our fingers crossed and see what happens.
[00:44:23.778 --> 00:44:24.518]  Absolutely.
[00:44:24.558 --> 00:44:25.799]  Look, either way we win.
[00:44:25.819 --> 00:44:26.859]  I want to keep stressing this.
[00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:30.130]  People are now talking about the Federal Reserve being private.
[00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:33.131]  They're now talking about the North American Union, the SPP.
[00:44:33.631 --> 00:44:37.692]  They're now talking about the devaluation inflation tax.
[00:44:38.312 --> 00:44:43.713]  He is really, in all these debates and on television and Jay Leno, injected real issues.
[00:44:44.593 --> 00:44:45.673]  And it's accelerating.
[00:44:46.133 --> 00:44:49.354]  You know, it kind of, everything, what comes around goes around.
[00:44:50.954 --> 00:44:55.915]  And so, yes, we sent a large portion of the people to Ron Paul.
[00:44:57.199 --> 00:44:58.119]  He said this on air.
[00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:05.182]  A lot of his core group that really made him explode, and getting 10% even with the Cook numbers, that's still huge.
[00:45:05.942 --> 00:45:09.463]  10% of the voters are going for him and are now anti-New World Order.
[00:45:10.223 --> 00:45:12.424]  That's even with their spin.
[00:45:13.925 --> 00:45:23.868]  But now we're getting masses of people to the radio show, to the websites, truthnews.us, ronpaulwarroom.com, jonesreport.com, prisonplanet.com, prisonplanet.tv, infowars.net.
[00:45:24.887 --> 00:45:32.216]  We're getting masses of new blood, new people back now who never heard of me from the Paul campaign.
[00:45:33.117 --> 00:45:43.270]  That's what I try to explain to everybody else in the Patriot movement, kind of all the old horses and the mossbacks and the people that have been in this movement a long time, or people that have been in it just a few years.
[00:45:44.764 --> 00:45:49.907]  It's very painful to me that so many people I even know locally just get wild with jealousy when I'm even around them.
[00:45:49.927 --> 00:45:57.371]  They can't even contain the looks of hate and the sarcastic comments and the freaking out, you know, because they have to hear my name all over the place.
[00:45:57.391 --> 00:46:00.433]  They constantly hear about me, and it's like they're in competition with me.
[00:46:00.893 --> 00:46:02.154]  And they want to be big shots.
[00:46:02.234 --> 00:46:04.836]  Listen, I want you to be big shots, too.
[00:46:04.976 --> 00:46:08.958]  Patriots all over the country, you know, who are prominent radio hosts, webmasters.
[00:46:10.146 --> 00:46:11.567]  Believe me, I want to survive.
[00:46:12.007 --> 00:46:14.269]  I'm thinking about living every night when I go to sleep.
[00:46:14.309 --> 00:46:15.510]  I'm thinking about survival.
[00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:17.211]  I'm thinking about the depression that's coming.
[00:46:18.131 --> 00:46:20.493]  I'm girding myself to be arrested or set up.
[00:46:22.174 --> 00:46:23.195]  God, I hope it doesn't happen.
[00:46:23.595 --> 00:46:25.256]  And I know God's got a hedge of protection up around me.
[00:46:25.276 --> 00:46:26.257]  That's the only reason it hasn't.
[00:46:27.246 --> 00:46:28.707]  You know, the death threats, the rest of it.
[00:46:29.147 --> 00:46:30.708]  I mean, I'm here in the real world, folks.
[00:46:30.808 --> 00:46:32.348]  I really know what we're going in against.
[00:46:32.768 --> 00:46:45.014]  It's like we're X-Wings going in against the Death Star, and there's half the people in the patriot movement who are prominent think it's a popularity contest or a beauty contest, and they're freaking out that I'm the guy that keeps winning the Indy 500.
[00:46:45.554 --> 00:46:50.216]  It's not a good thing to be at the tip of the spear, to be winning every Indy 500.
[00:46:51.994 --> 00:46:59.207]  Okay, to have the most listeners, to dwarf everybody else in this movement, to be the kingpin, to have the whole thing orbiting around you.
[00:46:59.868 --> 00:47:03.495]  I welcome Ron Paul now having a lot of it orbit him, but that's transient.
[00:47:04.312 --> 00:47:05.792]  If he doesn't win, that will fade.
[00:47:06.132 --> 00:47:06.793]  It's the movement.
[00:47:07.113 --> 00:47:08.373]  I want you to be big.
[00:47:08.513 --> 00:47:13.034]  I want, but I can't have you detest me, hate me, backstab me.
[00:47:13.154 --> 00:47:14.595]  I tried to build people up.
[00:47:14.895 --> 00:47:20.676]  I tried to have people on this show, and they just couldn't stand it when I got them in a position behind my back.
[00:47:20.716 --> 00:47:22.156]  They had to stick daggers in.
[00:47:22.777 --> 00:47:28.338]  So that's why I keep to myself, and then that looks like a woman shunned, a woman scorned.
[00:47:28.478 --> 00:47:30.339]  It's just a side issue.
[00:47:30.639 --> 00:47:31.899]  Folks, you better get your...
[00:47:34.342 --> 00:47:39.968]  You better get focused on issues that matter, okay?
[00:47:40.428 --> 00:47:41.069]  I mean, I know.
[00:47:41.089 --> 00:47:45.634]  Again, the analogy of the Death Star, I mean, how many guns?
[00:47:45.694 --> 00:47:46.194]  I'd say about 20.
[00:47:47.975 --> 00:47:49.456]  Some on the surface, some on the tower.
[00:47:49.516 --> 00:47:50.817]  Stabilize your rear deflectors.
[00:47:50.857 --> 00:47:51.777]  Watch for enemy fighters.
[00:47:52.038 --> 00:47:53.859]  I mean, I literally see it for what it is.
[00:47:54.139 --> 00:47:54.919]  We're going in.
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:59.923]  These turbo lasers are shooting right past us.
[00:48:00.343 --> 00:48:01.604]  Ships are blowing up around us.
[00:48:01.624 --> 00:48:02.484]  They're arresting people.
[00:48:02.504 --> 00:48:03.345]  They're killing people.
[00:48:03.545 --> 00:48:04.826]  They're CPSing people.
[00:48:04.986 --> 00:48:06.206]  They're overrunning everything.
[00:48:06.226 --> 00:48:07.928]  They're talking about us going into depression.
[00:48:08.348 --> 00:48:15.332]  And half our movement is ninning and preening and running around, snickering and giggling like it's fun.
[00:48:15.853 --> 00:48:16.353]  Believe me.
[00:48:16.933 --> 00:48:17.834]  It is not fun.
[00:48:17.934 --> 00:48:18.854]  It's not a joke.
[00:48:19.194 --> 00:48:19.975]  It's not a game.
[00:48:21.715 --> 00:48:26.998]  And the reason a lot of people in this movement don't have a big audience, people rally around them, is because the public is good.
[00:48:27.778 --> 00:48:28.719]  You are good people.
[00:48:29.699 --> 00:48:30.179]  On average.
[00:48:30.359 --> 00:48:31.380]  You're the salt of the earth.
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:38.943]  And the public's got their heart right, their soul in the right direction, their head screwed on straight, and they can hear truth and veritas.
[00:48:39.243 --> 00:48:41.604]  And they can understand what we're in.
[00:48:41.624 --> 00:48:44.006]  They understand this is do or die.
[00:48:44.046 --> 00:48:44.906]  This is survival.
[00:48:45.692 --> 00:48:50.695]  And so people in this movement who've gotten in somewhat prominent positions wonder why they're not big shots.
[00:48:50.755 --> 00:48:52.736]  It's because people see through you.
[00:48:53.096 --> 00:48:58.279]  If you got your spirit right, and if you got your soul right, then you could be real leaders.
[00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:07.525]  But then you would pay the price of a great power coming, great responsibility, and then you'll have to have other people around you who are in it for the wrong reasons hate you.
[00:49:08.285 --> 00:49:10.887]  And it's not a fun thing, I will assure you.
[00:49:13.132 --> 00:49:14.893]  And I've already digressed off into other subjects.
[00:49:14.973 --> 00:49:18.816]  It's just, we are in such massive crises, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:18.996 --> 00:49:22.438]  I mean, you can tell I've gotten a lot more serious on air.
[00:49:23.159 --> 00:49:24.320]  I've gotten a lot more focused.
[00:49:25.801 --> 00:49:27.302]  I've been joking around a lot less.
[00:49:27.362 --> 00:49:28.582]  I like to be a happy person.
[00:49:29.543 --> 00:49:31.324]  I mean, every day I am chastened.
[00:49:31.464 --> 00:49:32.305]  I am braced.
[00:49:32.585 --> 00:49:41.151]  I am, I am, it's just, I mean, every night I'm on my knees to God and just begging God to please protect the innocent.
[00:49:42.273 --> 00:49:43.193]  With whatever happens.
[00:49:44.094 --> 00:49:45.574]  And please protect my family.
[00:49:46.535 --> 00:49:48.836]  I ask God every day, don't let them do anything to my family.
[00:49:49.376 --> 00:49:50.836]  I'm committed, you know, I'm committed.
[00:49:51.117 --> 00:49:53.157]  They don't have a future anyways, and we don't beat these people.
[00:49:53.898 --> 00:49:57.359]  So they can't get at me that way, but at the same time, I just ask God, let them take me.
[00:49:58.540 --> 00:49:59.900]  I never ask God for anything.
[00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:03.602]  I say, leave God and direct me, and whatever happens, it's your will.
[00:50:04.522 --> 00:50:09.424]  I'm not like these televangelists, you know, that tell everybody to go pray and ask for a Cadillac or whatever, or, you know,
[00:50:10.009 --> 00:50:11.390]  If God gives me anything.
[00:50:19.352 --> 00:50:25.216]  You know, they can do whatever they want, destroy my name, drag me through the mud, attack me, kill me, imprison me, whatever.
[00:50:25.636 --> 00:50:27.637]  Just don't let them hurt the innocents.
[00:50:28.177 --> 00:50:32.100]  And I would hope that God would grant me that because all I've ever done is stand up for the innocents.
[00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:36.442]  It tears my guts out to have a woman on who the CPS has taken their kids.
[00:50:36.723 --> 00:50:39.524]  I should have more of those people on, but frankly, I can't stand it.
[00:50:39.984 --> 00:50:41.846]  I can't stand the pain in their voice.
[00:50:42.246 --> 00:50:45.588]  I can't stand knowing how the evil has their way with innocents.
[00:50:46.585 --> 00:50:50.612]  Dear little sweet innocence everywhere, and I want to beat these evil people.
[00:50:51.093 --> 00:50:54.238]  And I know we could if you would stand up and be warriors for good.
[00:50:54.258 --> 00:50:58.806]  And if you'd get your head screwed on straight and take action against the New World Order.
[00:50:59.147 --> 00:51:00.309]  It's do or die.
[00:51:02.032 --> 00:51:14.778]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in Internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:51:15.179 --> 00:51:21.922]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[00:51:22.262 --> 00:51:22.702]  We're good to go.
[00:51:53.185 --> 00:51:55.471]  We're in a no-holds-barred information war.
[00:51:55.851 --> 00:52:01.165]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[00:52:01.869 --> 00:52:02.529]  It's a fact.
[00:52:02.749 --> 00:52:10.230]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:52:10.351 --> 00:52:19.212]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[00:52:19.492 --> 00:52:30.014]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecure debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:52:30.294 --> 00:52:36.358]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[00:52:36.578 --> 00:52:41.581]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[00:52:41.782 --> 00:52:46.264]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[00:52:46.425 --> 00:52:48.226]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[00:52:48.246 --> 00:52:48.546]  That's 877-943-8600.
[00:52:48.566 --> 00:52:48.966]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[00:52:49.086 --> 00:52:50.948]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery
[00:52:58.152 --> 00:52:59.815]  Visit FDRS.org today.
[00:53:01.926 --> 00:53:02.386]  Hi, Ken.
[00:53:02.426 --> 00:53:03.206]  It's Judy again.
[00:53:03.226 --> 00:53:07.747]  I just wanted to call you back and let you know how thankful Mike and I are for your working with us.
[00:53:07.907 --> 00:53:11.048]  You know the sun oven we ordered from you on KenSolar.com?
[00:53:11.268 --> 00:53:13.148]  It cooks all of our food and then some.
[00:53:13.428 --> 00:53:15.489]  Plus, we just sold the old gas barbecue.
[00:53:15.689 --> 00:53:21.790]  Also, the solar power generator reduced our electric bill just like you said it would, and it's powering my whole studio right now.
[00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:27.291]  We don't have to worry about our food going bad or surviving the outages anymore, either of which is huge.
[00:53:27.551 --> 00:53:30.412]  Well, Ken, I'll cut this one short for now, and thanks again.
[00:53:30.532 --> 00:53:31.452]  Go, Ken Solar!
[00:53:32.751 --> 00:53:34.272]  Get the best of both worlds.
[00:53:34.693 --> 00:53:39.817]  Solar power for your household essentials and a backup generator all in one.
[00:53:39.997 --> 00:53:41.378]  Perfect for hurricane seasons.
[00:53:41.398 --> 00:53:45.202]  No long gas lines, no fumes, and no noise.
[00:53:45.902 --> 00:53:48.584]  Lower your electric bill and be prepared year-round.
[00:53:49.225 --> 00:53:51.547]  Complete solar kits for under $1,200.
[00:53:51.787 --> 00:53:55.911]  See the complete solar power generator kit at KenSolar.com.
[00:53:56.071 --> 00:53:59.894]  Order your solar power generator from Ken's website at KenSolar.com.
[00:54:08.186 --> 00:54:31.773]  I read the news today, oh boy About a lucky man who made the grade And though the news was rather sad Well, I just had to laugh I saw the photograph
[00:54:39.192 --> 00:55:02.995]  He blew his mind out in a car He didn't notice that the lights had changed A crowd of people stood and stared They'd seen his face before Nobody was really sure he was from the house
[00:55:17.665 --> 00:55:21.487]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:21.527 --> 00:55:21.667]  Marty...
[00:55:43.428 --> 00:55:47.971]  Darren, Robert, Carl, Tommy, many others, your calls are coming up as soon as we start the second hour.
[00:55:47.991 --> 00:55:50.072]  Let me just tell you some of what's coming up.
[00:55:50.572 --> 00:55:52.554]  Conference promotes global citizenship.
[00:55:54.135 --> 00:56:01.039]  We're also going to get into the Mexican government openly influencing internal U.S.
[00:56:01.179 --> 00:56:01.759]  politics.
[00:56:01.819 --> 00:56:06.262]  I mean, this is just... It's open season on this country.
[00:56:06.302 --> 00:56:11.225]  The establishment is just allowing any type of corruption, any type of foreign meddling...
[00:56:11.997 --> 00:56:14.058]  Any type of... But none of that's the threat.
[00:56:14.118 --> 00:56:20.339]  No, it's the blonde-haired, blue-eyed secret Al-Qaeda teams that Fox News and the media and the FBI say are everywhere.
[00:56:20.379 --> 00:56:23.860]  And there's terrorists hiding in your cupboard and in your closet.
[00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:25.480]  I mean, it's just on its face.
[00:56:26.961 --> 00:56:27.881]  Utterly ridiculous.
[00:56:28.061 --> 00:56:31.882]  And I really don't watch television anymore.
[00:56:32.202 --> 00:56:36.323]  And every few weeks, or maybe once a month, I end up watching an hour of it.
[00:56:39.264 --> 00:56:40.104]  And Saturday night...
[00:56:40.979 --> 00:56:51.564]  I flipped through the channels at the hotel in Dallas, and it was literal just training everyone to act like animals and just gibbering mindlessness.
[00:56:53.665 --> 00:56:56.186]  They have really done a job on us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:56.847 --> 00:56:57.747]  It's very daunting.
[00:56:57.787 --> 00:56:58.787]  It's very shocking.
[00:56:58.867 --> 00:57:02.829]  It's hellish what they're creating, what they're doing.
[00:57:02.869 --> 00:57:03.910]  They know what they're doing.
[00:57:05.070 --> 00:57:07.391]  And very few, even those in the system, don't have the pieces.
[00:57:07.411 --> 00:57:08.472]  They don't see it.
[00:57:09.028 --> 00:57:16.333]  For what it is, but I want to tell all the CIA people and all the FBI people and all the cops and all the social workers and all of you, most of you think you're doing a good job.
[00:57:16.353 --> 00:57:17.254]  You're compartmentalized.
[00:57:17.274 --> 00:57:19.495]  You don't see how it all fits together.
[00:57:19.635 --> 00:57:21.476]  You're being attacked by the very same system.
[00:57:22.637 --> 00:57:25.299]  And just God help us if you don't wake up and speak out.
[00:57:25.319 --> 00:57:26.019]  But it's your job.
[00:57:26.059 --> 00:57:27.080]  It's what you were trying to do.
[00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:31.943]  It's the economy, and it's going to get worse as they fully shift over into it.
[00:57:32.544 --> 00:57:34.325]  But I do see massive resistance mounting.
[00:57:35.199 --> 00:57:39.664]  Before I end this hour, we've only got nine days left in the PrisonPlanet.tv special.
[00:57:39.804 --> 00:57:43.928]  Five months free right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:57:44.809 --> 00:57:47.692]  And you can see the films in super high quality, all 18 of them.
[00:57:47.712 --> 00:57:48.773]  I mean, the quality now.
[00:57:48.813 --> 00:57:50.094]  The servers are so fast.
[00:57:50.475 --> 00:57:52.357]  Four times T1 if you've got the connection.
[00:57:52.757 --> 00:57:54.138]  Download them in super high quality.
[00:57:54.178 --> 00:57:55.119]  Download and stream them.
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:57.542]  Flash, QuickTime, Windows.
[00:57:58.735 --> 00:58:00.618]  I mean, just in super high quality.
[00:58:00.638 --> 00:58:01.540]  It looks like television.
[00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:02.461]  I mean, it looks that good.
[00:58:02.501 --> 00:58:04.484]  It's almost as good as DVD.
[00:58:04.584 --> 00:58:12.357]  Or if you want to actually hold the DVD, own the DVD, collect the DVD of Endgame or Terror Storm or Road to Tyranny or Order of Death.
[00:58:12.972 --> 00:58:14.814]  Transmission continues in 70 seconds.
[00:58:44.159 --> 00:58:45.680]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:46.661 --> 00:58:48.942]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:59:06.661 --> 00:59:10.185]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.465 --> 00:59:14.588]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:24.797 --> 00:59:26.939]  The New World Order's making their move.
[00:59:26.999 --> 00:59:31.263]  The grid, the enslavement dehumanization grid is activated.
[00:59:31.283 --> 00:59:33.725]  They're expanding its field.
[00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:36.761]  Brace yourselves, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:36.801 --> 00:59:39.782]  We're going to get into the unraveling of the economy coming up in this hour.
[00:59:40.202 --> 00:59:42.663]  Wide open phones, a bunch of other global New World Order news.
[00:59:42.703 --> 00:59:43.903]  It's all extremely important.
[00:59:44.763 --> 00:59:46.684]  Right now, let's go to Marty in Texas.
[00:59:47.044 --> 00:59:47.804]  Welcome, Marty.
[00:59:47.824 --> 00:59:48.945]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:59:49.165 --> 00:59:49.405]  Hi.
[00:59:49.985 --> 00:59:53.146]  Hey, first I just want to say God bless you, man, and God bless your work.
[00:59:53.486 --> 00:59:53.866]  Thank you.
[00:59:53.927 --> 00:59:54.527]  God bless you.
[00:59:54.987 --> 00:59:56.087]  And keep up the fight.
[00:59:56.367 --> 00:59:57.588]  Hey, listen, I was in the U.S.
[00:59:57.648 --> 01:00:03.930]  Army back during the Iran-Contra scandal, and I was an infantry soldier back then.
[01:00:04.554 --> 01:00:08.979]  But, you know, back then the New World Order was a buzzword.
[01:00:09.019 --> 01:00:10.240]  We really didn't know what it meant.
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:12.762]  We just knew, you know, that it was a bad thing.
[01:00:13.263 --> 01:00:19.629]  And I just want to thank you for all the work that you're doing in exposing all this corruption, all the lies, and all the stuff that you have exposed.
[01:00:20.370 --> 01:00:22.092]  I also want to know, though, what...
[01:00:22.745 --> 01:00:23.506]  Well where are you?
[01:00:23.526 --> 01:00:23.906]  I'm in Dallas.
[01:00:40.788 --> 01:00:44.149]  You know, my job is just generating awareness.
[01:00:44.509 --> 01:00:51.091]  Still, the majority of people, they know they're being lied to, but they don't know exactly how, or they can't even fathom or imagine how big it is.
[01:00:52.171 --> 01:00:59.654]  Our job really is to continue the education process, and then this show, You Spreading the Word, is one of the main engines.
[01:01:00.554 --> 01:01:01.634]  We then wake people up.
[01:01:01.994 --> 01:01:05.115]  They go join other local organizations, national organizations.
[01:01:05.635 --> 01:01:07.856]  You can get involved in controlling the border groups.
[01:01:07.956 --> 01:01:08.736]  Those are in Dallas.
[01:01:09.617 --> 01:01:10.477]  Second Amendment groups.
[01:01:11.181 --> 01:01:11.381]  I think?
[01:01:33.797 --> 01:01:34.098]  I think?
[01:01:47.950 --> 01:01:53.933]  Then, you know, just to show their animals, they then make them sign up to that to basically lose control of their farm and ranch.
[01:01:54.373 --> 01:01:57.294]  You know, educate, educate, educate strategically.
[01:01:57.654 --> 01:02:04.857]  Find out, you know, go to Corridor Watch and find out where there's anti-Napa Superhighway, Trans-Texas Corridor meetings.
[01:02:04.877 --> 01:02:05.758]  They're having them all over.
[01:02:05.778 --> 01:02:07.098]  Find out where they're having government meetings.
[01:02:07.478 --> 01:02:08.219]  Go to those.
[01:02:09.972 --> 01:02:10.753]  It's all of us.
[01:02:11.193 --> 01:02:12.936]  Go get a show on Dallas Access.
[01:02:12.956 --> 01:02:14.618]  I don't think they've shut that completely down yet.
[01:02:14.958 --> 01:02:16.500]  Reach tens of thousands every show.
[01:02:18.022 --> 01:02:19.985]  Just engage, engage, engage.
[01:02:20.526 --> 01:02:21.547]  Go to the colleges.
[01:02:22.348 --> 01:02:24.051]  Hand out flyers about how they're
[01:02:24.811 --> 01:02:26.513]  Don't join Homeland Security.
[01:02:26.573 --> 01:02:27.754]  Don't join these systems.
[01:02:28.614 --> 01:02:32.417]  Or explain to them how they're converting it over into this police state economy.
[01:02:32.838 --> 01:02:34.399]  I mean, there's just so much we can do.
[01:02:34.439 --> 01:02:40.304]  But the best thing, the most powerful thing, is getting films like Endgame, Terror Storm, and making copies of them.
[01:02:40.764 --> 01:02:47.970]  I mean, the top three videos right now are Freedom to Fascism, Terror Storm, for like three weeks now on Google Video.
[01:02:48.010 --> 01:02:52.894]  Google's now taken the video link off their front page because they know tens of millions are seeing the films.
[01:02:52.914 --> 01:02:54.035]  They've taken the view counters.
[01:02:54.675 --> 01:02:55.676]  We're good to go.
[01:03:18.599 --> 01:03:19.920]  The enemy's not going to announce it.
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:20.800]  We're smashing them.
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:24.942]  Remember the Iraqi information officer claiming there were no troops in Baghdad?
[01:03:25.223 --> 01:03:26.443]  That's what the New World Order's doing.
[01:03:26.723 --> 01:03:29.185]  Their final illusion is that we're not exploding.
[01:03:29.445 --> 01:03:34.267]  They're desperately trying to shift everything over to spooks and camps and recruiting the preachers.
[01:03:34.627 --> 01:03:36.068]  Go into all the major churches.
[01:03:36.588 --> 01:03:39.590]  Confront the preachers during the service.
[01:03:39.610 --> 01:03:41.091]  Hey, are you on the federal payroll?
[01:03:41.531 --> 01:03:47.334]  And have a hundred handouts with the news articles and links where they can find out the preachers have been secretly co-opted.
[01:03:47.794 --> 01:03:51.315]  You know, blast their black ops back into Hades.
[01:03:51.775 --> 01:03:52.656]  Here we go.
[01:03:54.196 --> 01:04:02.118]  For years, you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained a leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[01:04:02.579 --> 01:04:05.759]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?
[01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:09.161]  The answer is high quality and huge selection.
[01:04:09.561 --> 01:04:14.382]  Just visit HerbalHealer.com and shop online or request a free catalog.
[01:04:14.802 --> 01:04:17.143]  You're bound to find the alternative you're looking for.
[01:04:17.893 --> 01:04:22.558]  Did you know that Herbal Healer carries the latest, safest, and effective weight loss products?
[01:04:23.078 --> 01:04:28.964]  You can also count on Herbal Healer for the largest selection of safe and natural supplements just for children.
[01:04:29.284 --> 01:04:30.426]  And don't forget your pets.
[01:04:30.886 --> 01:04:36.552]  Herbal Healer even has natural mineral supplements for all your animals, including horses, cows, and birds.
[01:04:37.012 --> 01:04:37.593]  We're good to go.
[01:04:54.073 --> 01:04:55.755]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[01:04:56.075 --> 01:04:59.539]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:04:59.699 --> 01:05:01.561]  But in liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:05:01.581 --> 01:05:04.904]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:05:05.225 --> 01:05:09.249]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding
[01:05:09.309 --> 01:05:09.689]  We're good to go.
[01:05:39.309 --> 01:05:39.749]  We're good to go.
[01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:40.230]  We're good to go.
[01:05:54.309 --> 01:05:55.830]  And guard our nation here at home by bringing home the troops.
[01:06:23.929 --> 01:06:24.810]  This is our chance, America.
[01:06:24.830 --> 01:06:25.150]  Stand up.
[01:06:25.210 --> 01:06:26.271]  Now is the time to act.
[01:06:55.183 --> 01:07:01.185]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.806 --> 01:07:04.847]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:05.747 --> 01:07:06.728]  Yeah, it's not a joke.
[01:07:06.768 --> 01:07:11.049]  We come to you from occupied United States of America, the fallen republic.
[01:07:11.950 --> 01:07:17.992]  We will not get the republic back unless we can educate the public that this actually happened.
[01:07:18.752 --> 01:07:22.394]  I mean, when Thomas Barnett, the big naval war college,
[01:07:23.697 --> 01:07:30.362]  A fellow gets up on C-SPAN and admits that the military works for Madison Avenue and the foreign banks and the New World Order.
[01:07:31.383 --> 01:07:36.527]  When all of this is developing, we have to get that word out to the public.
[01:07:36.547 --> 01:07:37.968]  This is not our government anymore.
[01:07:37.988 --> 01:07:39.570]  It is not here for good.
[01:07:39.610 --> 01:07:40.450]  It is here for evil.
[01:07:42.012 --> 01:07:43.733]  That doesn't mean everybody in the government is evil.
[01:07:45.734 --> 01:07:47.796]  I mean, look at this story here out of the Daily Herald.
[01:07:48.036 --> 01:07:50.018]  Conference promotes global citizenship.
[01:07:50.038 --> 01:07:51.279]  It's up on JonesReport.com.
[01:07:55.234 --> 01:08:01.739]  As America continues to struggle with overseas... See, they admit all the stuff that's going on, but it's always good.
[01:08:01.799 --> 01:08:02.739]  It's good.
[01:08:02.759 --> 01:08:08.944]  Oh, they're going to make everybody in the colleges spies and how to look through their neighbors' walls and the kids in the schools.
[01:08:08.984 --> 01:08:09.644]  It's good.
[01:08:10.204 --> 01:08:16.068]  I mean, you know, all the awesome schools give them little cards and roll them in tattletale programs and give them 200 bucks when they turn family members in.
[01:08:16.769 --> 01:08:18.430]  I had that in Road to Tyranny six years old.
[01:08:20.912 --> 01:08:22.633]  See, I mean, it's a total shift.
[01:08:25.871 --> 01:08:34.115]  And illegal aliens can drive around without a driver's license and no insurance, but in Williamson County, if you're two days late in returning your video to the video store, they come and arrest you, see?
[01:08:35.516 --> 01:08:38.418]  Maximum total enforcement against the people.
[01:08:38.438 --> 01:08:39.298]  That's what tyranny is.
[01:08:40.279 --> 01:08:42.100]  And then the government and everybody else can just do whatever they want.
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:45.781]  But listen to this, how it's just all calmly reported.
[01:08:46.282 --> 01:08:48.503]  Conference promotes global citizenship.
[01:08:51.664 --> 01:09:03.228]  As America continues to struggle with overseas outsourcing and increasing global competition, professors at the University of Wisconsin, Stevens Point, are working to arm graduates with the skills needed to become global citizens.
[01:09:03.328 --> 01:09:09.690]  Now, oh, we're struggling because of globalism, but that's not what's causing it.
[01:09:09.710 --> 01:09:11.310]  We need more globalism, they go on to say.
[01:09:12.371 --> 01:09:18.653]  Oh, so we're struggling, the dollar's falling apart, the dollar's been devalued.
[01:09:19.767 --> 01:09:22.069]  The media won't tell you that's why we're having economic problems.
[01:09:22.089 --> 01:09:25.891]  They just tell you we need to devalue the dollar more, print more money, issue more credit.
[01:09:26.191 --> 01:09:26.992]  That's the answer.
[01:09:27.852 --> 01:09:29.353]  Deeper into the pit.
[01:09:31.315 --> 01:09:34.357]  But see, just how they phrased it all, just like NPR this morning.
[01:09:34.377 --> 01:09:38.860]  Oh, they're turning everybody into spies at the schools and having to be James Bonds watching their neighbors.
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:40.761]  Oh, it's so good, the new economy.
[01:09:42.296 --> 01:09:52.322]  As America continues to struggle with overseas outsourcing and increasing global competition, professors at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point are working to arm graduates with the skills needed to become global citizens.
[01:09:52.342 --> 01:09:58.485]  See, globalization's hurting us, but it's causing some problems, but we'll just, we'll get deeper into it.
[01:09:58.526 --> 01:09:59.326]  That will fix it.
[01:09:59.906 --> 01:10:00.927]  Continuing, Robert...
[01:10:01.835 --> 01:10:13.101]  McGaugh, we'll try to get him on, a senior education specialist, researcher and program manager with the World Bank encourages professors, with a grant of course, to take seriously the need to give students a global education.
[01:10:14.042 --> 01:10:18.324]  Some see globalization as a destructive influence as a bad thing at this time in history.
[01:10:18.344 --> 01:10:21.126]  See, they don't teach you reading, writing, arithmetic, science, history.
[01:10:21.506 --> 01:10:23.707]  They teach you how good global is.
[01:10:25.108 --> 01:10:25.828]  Oh, it's good.
[01:10:25.848 --> 01:10:27.029]  They don't teach you any skills.
[01:10:27.089 --> 01:10:28.950]  It's just be a good spy, be a good global expert.
[01:10:30.603 --> 01:10:33.525]  And how to go then be part of the global bureaucracy.
[01:10:34.226 --> 01:10:36.788]  Some see globalization as a destructive influence and a bad thing.
[01:10:36.828 --> 01:10:39.149]  At this time in history, globalization is here to stay.
[01:10:40.911 --> 01:10:41.891]  See, it's here to stay.
[01:10:42.051 --> 01:10:45.334]  Some see it as bad, but you will be assimilated.
[01:10:45.894 --> 01:10:46.675]  You will submit.
[01:10:47.135 --> 01:10:47.916]  You will lose.
[01:10:48.316 --> 01:10:49.497]  Globalization is here to stay.
[01:10:49.717 --> 01:10:51.158]  And we must learn to live with it.
[01:10:51.198 --> 01:10:52.999]  See, we must just, let's move forward.
[01:10:53.019 --> 01:10:54.421]  Just accept we've dominated you.
[01:10:54.641 --> 01:10:55.401]  There is no hope.
[01:10:55.862 --> 01:10:56.242]  It's over.
[01:10:58.584 --> 01:10:59.104]  That's what he says.
[01:10:59.204 --> 01:11:02.567]  Some see globalization as a destructive influence as a bad thing.
[01:11:02.927 --> 01:11:06.289]  At this time in history, globalization is here to stay, and we must learn to live with it.
[01:11:06.709 --> 01:11:13.774]  McGaugh told instructors Thursday during a 2012 annual UWSP teaching conference.
[01:11:13.794 --> 01:11:14.974]  It's the 12th annual.
[01:11:15.735 --> 01:11:17.196]  They have these every major university.
[01:11:19.177 --> 01:11:23.540]  Teaching with a global perspective, preparing students to be global citizens is the name of it.
[01:11:24.921 --> 01:11:26.462]  And I've been to one of these UN summits.
[01:11:26.482 --> 01:11:42.375]  They take the best and brightest of all the high schools, every public school, most your top private schools, are in it, and they teach you about global government, global taxes, global regulation, sustainability, and then you talk about it, and the media comes on and says you're insane, it doesn't exist.
[01:11:43.496 --> 01:11:44.597]  All psychological warfare.
[01:11:45.238 --> 01:11:52.764]  Globalization affects everyone, even the World Bank, which now outsources a majority of its accounting work to New Delhi.
[01:11:55.327 --> 01:12:01.692]  McGough said, countries such as India and China are destined to be superpowers, or at least major players.
[01:12:03.613 --> 01:12:13.100]  McGough said, drawing on the need for sustainability, see, that means de-industrialization, enslavement of us, the globalists above all the nations, playing them off against each other so no nation is independent.
[01:12:14.221 --> 01:12:18.484]  Drawing on the need of sustainability, that means social workers running your life, one-child policies.
[01:12:18.965 --> 01:12:20.606]  Sustainability means eugenics.
[01:12:21.086 --> 01:12:22.027]  So let's just change the word.
[01:12:22.307 --> 01:12:34.377]  Drawing on the need for eugenics and a eugenics-controlled society, continuing with what he said, economic development and self-sufficiency, that means living with less, being a groveling slave, not having an economy anymore.
[01:12:36.118 --> 01:12:41.142]  McGaw offered a strong case for educating college students in the ways of the world.
[01:12:42.873 --> 01:12:50.519]  That is buying into the ideology of global socialism for the elite, consolidation, socializing our wealth, transferring it to them, taking over private property.
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:56.263]  Over time, he says, you will find more college graduates going overseas for work.
[01:12:56.923 --> 01:13:03.989]  See, not just bringing in the foreigners or exporting our jobs, but even exporting our brain trust overseas to fully bring down the U.S.
[01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:07.771]  Over time, we'll find more college graduates going overseas for work.
[01:13:08.312 --> 01:13:11.374]  These other countries are going to be major sources of employment for
[01:13:12.429 --> 01:13:19.476]  He said, Organizing by the Office of Academic Affairs, the One Day Conference featured workshops on cross-cultural teaching and learning.
[01:13:19.496 --> 01:13:26.163]  There's lots of gibbering, loving, having your culture destroyed, overrunning everything, falling borders, integration.
[01:13:26.504 --> 01:13:27.104]  That's what that means.
[01:13:28.045 --> 01:13:28.866]  Let me just read what it says.
[01:13:29.006 --> 01:13:35.173]  Organized by the Office of Academic Affairs, the One Day Conference featured workshops on cross-cultural teaching and learning.
[01:13:36.209 --> 01:13:48.699]  Internationalizing the curriculum, developing interdisciplinary approaches to global education, incorporating non-Western themes in the classroom, and developing global citizenship through local service learning activities.
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:53.603]  So they want to destroy Americana and anything that actually worked here to make us actually weaker.
[01:13:53.643 --> 01:13:54.624]  This was all designed for that.
[01:13:55.564 --> 01:13:56.165]  Factually...
[01:13:56.952 --> 01:13:57.392]  It goes on.
[01:13:57.513 --> 01:14:02.237]  Faculty have left this conference in the past and rewritten their entire syllabus.
[01:14:02.737 --> 01:14:09.303]  See, the faculty comes and then they go back and integrate all this because then they get more grants and get to be toted at the conferences.
[01:14:10.304 --> 01:14:13.687]  Faculty have left the conference in the past and rewritten their entire syllabi.
[01:14:14.348 --> 01:14:18.472]  It said David Osbath, a geology professor.
[01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:27.193]  Maureen Gilben of the Tutoring Learning Center asked McGaugh what skills recent graduates are missing.
[01:14:27.833 --> 01:14:29.793]  Language is one aspect most graduates don't have.
[01:14:29.813 --> 01:14:32.494]  He said American graduates are often naive and immature.
[01:14:32.794 --> 01:14:35.115]  They have an inability to understand how to communicate.
[01:14:35.836 --> 01:14:37.036]  Well, that was done by design.
[01:14:37.376 --> 01:14:40.157]  See, they'll mention real problems, but then none of that's actually taught.
[01:14:41.057 --> 01:14:45.759]  Institutions of higher education have a responsibility to teach students to be globally aware, McGaugh
[01:14:46.582 --> 01:14:46.882]  Sad.
[01:14:47.163 --> 01:14:52.707]  The United States has had a good run using 50% of the world's resources, but the world won't let us do that anymore.
[01:14:53.487 --> 01:14:56.129]  See, you're not getting the resources anymore.
[01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:56.750]  Did you hear that?
[01:14:57.370 --> 01:14:58.311]  They always say that.
[01:15:00.293 --> 01:15:01.894]  But see, it isn't like it's going to the third world.
[01:15:02.114 --> 01:15:08.579]  The elite are going to take what you have now and transfer that to places they fully already control.
[01:15:08.859 --> 01:15:12.022]  That's the quickest way to then get full dominance and control here.
[01:15:12.422 --> 01:15:16.225]  Now, there's the story deciphered for you.
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:19.521]  You can go read it for yourself.
[01:15:19.921 --> 01:15:28.204]  But try telling your neighbors at every major college, shifting the curriculum for 50 years, but now accelerating it, to global government, global citizenship, global IDs.
[01:15:29.004 --> 01:15:30.724]  Try to tell them that there's a national ID card.
[01:15:30.744 --> 01:15:31.645]  They may admit it now.
[01:15:31.805 --> 01:15:33.025]  We've had it for more than 10 years.
[01:15:33.765 --> 01:15:36.126]  But tell them it was already globalized in 2000.
[01:15:36.586 --> 01:15:37.246]  They don't believe you.
[01:15:41.908 --> 01:15:45.449]  And they'll tell you, hey, how about that game last night?
[01:15:49.198 --> 01:15:51.400]  We've been taught how to not talk to each other and interact.
[01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:55.162]  You'll get your tires rotated, you'll get your oil changed, you're sitting there with a bunch of guys.
[01:15:55.763 --> 01:16:04.689]  All they're talking about is the football game, not how the country's falling apart, not how it's being overrun, not how the Mexican government is influencing our internal operations.
[01:16:04.970 --> 01:16:05.910]  Let's play that clip now.
[01:16:05.950 --> 01:16:07.872]  Here's just the first minute of Lou Dobbs Friday.
[01:16:08.392 --> 01:16:09.933]  This is up on truthnews.us.
[01:16:11.394 --> 01:16:17.439]  The battle over illegal immigration is about to become the subject of a multi-million dollar advertising campaign in this country.
[01:16:18.235 --> 01:16:21.538]  And guess who may be paying for a large part of that?
[01:16:21.638 --> 01:16:22.439]  You'll never guess.
[01:16:22.959 --> 01:16:24.200]  The government of Mexico.
[01:16:24.741 --> 01:16:25.081]  A U.S.
[01:16:25.121 --> 01:16:35.890]  advertising executive says he's close to a deal with the Mexican government to help fund a $100 million ad campaign that would be pushing, you guessed it, amnesty for illegal aliens.
[01:16:36.411 --> 01:16:37.712]  Casey Wyant has our report.
[01:16:39.634 --> 01:16:40.915]  Lobbying groups for the U.S.
[01:16:40.975 --> 01:16:52.239]  construction, agriculture, and other industries with large illegal alien workforces are funding a series of pro-amnesty TV ads scheduled to air after this year's presidential convention.
[01:16:52.759 --> 01:17:02.763]  And Mexican government funding for the ad campaign is, quote, a very, very strong possibility, says the executive director of Nat.org, Mexicans and Americans thinking together.
[01:17:03.243 --> 01:17:06.244]  It's hoping to raise $100 million for the ad campaign.
[01:17:06.324 --> 01:17:07.965]  This campaign is...
[01:17:08.565 --> 01:17:11.106]  As important as a presidential campaign.
[01:17:11.626 --> 01:17:18.708]  So you have globalist corporations in concert with the banks, with Mexico, the U.S.
[01:17:18.748 --> 01:17:20.068]  government, Rob Allen & Co.
[01:17:20.108 --> 01:17:20.569]  in Dallas.
[01:17:21.169 --> 01:17:21.969]  Rob Allen & Co.
[01:17:22.009 --> 01:17:25.450]  in Dallas, in 2005, December 25th, Dallas Morning News, admitted...
[01:17:29.924 --> 01:17:32.865]  Tens of millions of dollars from the Mexican government, the U.S.
[01:17:32.905 --> 01:17:41.026]  government, to go pay for and finance and then pay off the media, as you saw, to say how great the illegal aliens are running around waving Mexican flags.
[01:17:41.046 --> 01:17:42.067]  They engineered the whole thing.
[01:17:42.407 --> 01:17:43.927]  And they did it last year, and they'll do it this year.
[01:17:45.987 --> 01:17:51.389]  They had trucks there handing out American flags, and the illegals refused the first stuff in 2006, and it really backfired.
[01:17:52.689 --> 01:17:57.650]  Remember the meat packers, the big companies, paid their employees to be off for three, four days to go around demonstrating?
[01:17:58.283 --> 01:18:01.544]  Will the companies here pay you to go demonstrate for America?
[01:18:02.104 --> 01:18:02.444]  Oh, no.
[01:18:03.304 --> 01:18:04.504]  Did the cops arrest the illegals?
[01:18:04.524 --> 01:18:06.325]  Did they ever stop them when they block highways?
[01:18:06.705 --> 01:18:07.265]  Unpermitted?
[01:18:07.585 --> 01:18:08.725]  No, but they will you.
[01:18:09.305 --> 01:18:10.925]  Did they call out the cops in the riot gear?
[01:18:11.065 --> 01:18:11.345]  No.
[01:18:11.365 --> 01:18:12.686]  Except for one time in L.A.
[01:18:12.706 --> 01:18:13.966]  because they assaulted cops.
[01:18:17.167 --> 01:18:17.487]  Do they?
[01:18:17.527 --> 01:18:21.807]  When they were attacking people in Dallas, it came out in local news in Mesquite.
[01:18:22.328 --> 01:18:24.348]  The illegal aliens started beating people up and stuff.
[01:18:27.802 --> 01:18:28.142]  You see?
[01:18:28.763 --> 01:18:31.685]  All of them ganged up against the United States to bring it down.
[01:18:34.086 --> 01:18:36.888]  Concerted, treasonous effort.
[01:18:37.808 --> 01:18:38.629]  In our affairs.
[01:18:40.290 --> 01:18:41.391]  Together against the people.
[01:18:43.912 --> 01:18:44.733]  All orchestrated.
[01:18:44.953 --> 01:18:46.334]  Oh, but there's no New World Order.
[01:18:46.674 --> 01:18:47.655]  None of this is happening.
[01:18:47.815 --> 01:18:48.835]  Come back, take your calls.
[01:18:49.096 --> 01:18:50.657]  Talk more about the Mexico situation.
[01:18:50.677 --> 01:18:51.137]  Stay with us.
[01:18:54.579 --> 01:18:55.900]  It is a big idea.
[01:18:57.046 --> 01:18:59.767]  A new world order in the near future.
[01:19:00.628 --> 01:19:03.028]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:19:03.689 --> 01:19:05.449]  It's known as the Builderberg.
[01:19:06.530 --> 01:19:08.771]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:19:09.311 --> 01:19:11.772]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:19:12.492 --> 01:19:19.835]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:19:22.836 --> 01:19:27.819]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:31.762]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:19:32.142 --> 01:19:34.664]  They'll prepare to make great progress toward a world of government.
[01:19:34.724 --> 01:19:35.705]  Most people have no idea.
[01:19:35.725 --> 01:19:36.645]  They're not after money.
[01:19:36.665 --> 01:19:37.726]  They have all the money they need.
[01:19:37.966 --> 01:19:38.707]  They're after power.
[01:19:38.927 --> 01:19:39.767]  That's their affirmation.

[01:22:41.454 --> 01:22:42.535]  Get up, stand up, stand up for your life.
[01:23:14.813 --> 01:23:20.437]  Look, the first step in discrediting this government, this new world order, is now coming to fruition.
[01:23:21.518 --> 01:23:28.503]  Now we have to get the public that isn't completely brain-dead and mesmerized by television and popular culture to find out exactly how bad it is.
[01:23:29.583 --> 01:23:31.785]  And we're well on our way to doing that, so take heart, folks.
[01:23:31.825 --> 01:23:37.309]  As bad as the news is, as bad as the big picture is, at least the people are starting to wake up.
[01:23:38.327 --> 01:23:42.429]  Let's go ahead and talk to Darren in Iowa.
[01:23:42.449 --> 01:23:43.049]  Thanks for holding.
[01:23:43.429 --> 01:23:44.369]  Hey, how are we doing, Alex?
[01:23:44.389 --> 01:23:45.030]  Good, sir.
[01:23:46.410 --> 01:23:50.732]  I'm calling in from southwest Iowa, and for those that aren't too familiar with U.S.
[01:23:50.752 --> 01:23:53.473]  geography, it's on the side closest to Omaha, Nebraska.
[01:23:54.113 --> 01:24:02.576]  And the other night I was sitting down doing some studying, and I heard the news station in Omaha, Nebraska, the one that was covering the mall massacre that happened a while ago,
[01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:06.341]  Say that Ron Paul tied McCain for second in Nevada.
[01:24:06.501 --> 01:24:13.804]  And as soon as I heard that, I threw down my book, jumped up, got on the phone, called their news station, and said, hey, you guys need to report the facts the way they are.
[01:24:13.824 --> 01:24:20.166]  And I said, I'm on CNN.com right now, and I can see that not only did Ron Paul beat McCain, but he beat him by a percentage point.
[01:24:20.206 --> 01:24:21.927]  It wasn't like it was a close number or anything.
[01:24:22.707 --> 01:24:24.247]  And they said, well, we'll look into it.
[01:24:24.267 --> 01:24:25.608]  We don't get our numbers from CNN.
[01:24:25.668 --> 01:24:26.448]  We get them from AP.
[01:24:26.508 --> 01:24:28.629]  So I went to AP's website, found the same result.
[01:24:29.059 --> 01:24:31.041]  I had my dad call him back because they censored my number.
[01:24:31.061 --> 01:24:34.643]  Now, I was out of town when all this happened, but I was told this and I saw similar numbers.
[01:24:34.684 --> 01:24:41.749]  Why don't you write that up in a simple two-paragraph article with links to your proof and post it on ronpaulwarroom.com.
[01:24:41.769 --> 01:24:42.490]  We need your help.
[01:24:42.570 --> 01:24:44.191]  Break down the exact numbers you saw.
[01:24:44.511 --> 01:24:45.132]  Be specific.
[01:24:45.152 --> 01:24:45.952]  Tell us what you witnessed.
[01:24:46.253 --> 01:24:50.716]  Well, I witnessed they came on and they said that Ron Paul tied McCain at 12% in Nevada.
[01:24:53.183 --> 01:24:54.064]  We're good to go.
[01:25:09.864 --> 01:25:21.207]  That Ron Paul pulled it out and won by a percentage point and did beat McCain, so they retracted it, but they spun it into a way that it seemed like... But then by the time it got to Fox, they didn't even show Ron Paul in the top five, and they said McCain got second place.
[01:25:21.247 --> 01:25:22.167]  We have the screenshots.
[01:25:22.467 --> 01:25:26.528]  Exactly, and I have it on a DVR, a DirecTV DVR recorder.
[01:25:26.568 --> 01:25:30.529]  I just have to figure out how to get it from there to... Call your friends if you have to.
[01:25:30.569 --> 01:25:31.050]  Do whatever.
[01:25:31.350 --> 01:25:32.490]  Get it loaded to YouTube.
[01:25:33.630 --> 01:25:34.591]  With a good headline.
[01:25:34.611 --> 01:25:36.212]  Write it up as a blurb.
[01:25:36.232 --> 01:25:39.034]  I mean, again, we need you.
[01:25:39.914 --> 01:25:41.955]  This is a grassroots operation.
[01:25:42.396 --> 01:25:42.876]  Exactly.
[01:25:44.437 --> 01:25:46.438]  But, I mean, there you are witnessing it for yourself.
[01:25:46.498 --> 01:25:51.241]  And I saw numbers yesterday because I was busy doing a shoot for a JFK film I'm making.
[01:25:51.761 --> 01:25:53.042]  We'll talk about that later in the third hour.
[01:25:53.742 --> 01:25:58.085]  And I was watching it on television and then I looked it up finally yesterday when I went to the studio.
[01:25:58.843 --> 01:25:59.163]  We're good to go.
[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:17.201]  So he did beat McCain.
[01:26:17.221 --> 01:26:19.983]  It should have been Paul second place, McCain third place.
[01:26:20.283 --> 01:26:24.605]  But they totally changed the order by doing that and then hid him behind McCain.
[01:26:25.066 --> 01:26:27.287]  Very slick, sneaky stuff they're doing.
[01:26:27.707 --> 01:26:28.548]  Yes.
[01:26:28.588 --> 01:26:33.251]  But again, the public probably can't even understand what we're saying because of all the fluoride.
[01:26:33.291 --> 01:26:37.873]  People that already wouldn't have genetically had very high IQs.
[01:26:38.194 --> 01:26:39.775]  They've been lowered down to moron level.
[01:26:40.075 --> 01:26:43.497]  Someone who would be very intelligent is lowered down to just average level like myself.
[01:26:44.310 --> 01:26:47.615]  And somebody like yourself is lowered down to just average level.
[01:26:47.896 --> 01:26:51.922]  But again, most of the public has literally been chemically attacked.
[01:26:52.606 --> 01:26:54.408]  And so they can't even understand you, sir.
[01:26:54.848 --> 01:26:55.088]  Exactly.
[01:26:55.168 --> 01:26:58.812]  If you ever have conversations with people and they're like real stupid, it's because they are dumb, sir.
[01:26:59.252 --> 01:27:02.154]  Oh yeah, like I feel like I'm constantly talking down to people just because I know.
[01:27:02.174 --> 01:27:04.256]  It was a military op in the 40s.
[01:27:04.296 --> 01:27:05.197]  They put it in the water.
[01:27:05.237 --> 01:27:06.999]  It's now even in Scientific American.
[01:27:07.039 --> 01:27:07.799]  It's now admitted.
[01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:12.403]  And they're just been, they literally have microscopic rod holes throughout their tissues.
[01:27:12.864 --> 01:27:13.705]  Not just their brain.
[01:27:14.445 --> 01:27:16.427]  And they just can't operate.
[01:27:16.974 --> 01:27:17.394]  Exactly.
[01:27:18.055 --> 01:27:24.080]  One thing I wanted to say, I've been a listener for about seven months and I'm really tired of the people calling in and trying to make suggestions.
[01:27:24.460 --> 01:27:31.106]  They need to get off their bums and do something because I think you're doing the best to your ability and doing what you can as one person and as a team.
[01:27:31.606 --> 01:27:38.652]  Instead of calling in and complaining and saying, you need to do this, you need to do that, people need to get off their bums and actually do something and take a stand for what they believe in.
[01:27:38.692 --> 01:27:40.674]  I think that's the reason our polls are turning out bad.
[01:27:41.149 --> 01:27:51.073]  In a way, it's because people expect us to pick them up in a forklift and dump them off at the voting precinct to vote, and they need to get out and take action if they want to see change, if they want their children to have a life.
[01:27:51.093 --> 01:27:52.314]  I hear you, and I appreciate your call.
[01:27:52.334 --> 01:27:52.994]  Let me just say this.
[01:27:53.034 --> 01:27:55.535]  People call on you with recommendations, and things are great.
[01:27:55.575 --> 01:27:56.036]  I love that.
[01:27:56.076 --> 01:27:56.796]  I appreciate that.
[01:27:56.836 --> 01:28:05.540]  But I agree with you in that somebody calls up and says, you need to do this, or you need to do that, and they're real haughty about it and real official, and I'm like, what have you done?
[01:28:06.542 --> 01:28:08.383]  I mean, I am not that good at organization.
[01:28:08.403 --> 01:28:09.564]  I'm not that good at a lot of things.
[01:28:09.644 --> 01:28:11.965]  I don't claim to be a super brain here.
[01:28:12.645 --> 01:28:14.226]  And I am working as hard as I can.
[01:28:14.286 --> 01:28:17.948]  I'm working too hard, probably, for peak performance.
[01:28:18.728 --> 01:28:21.790]  Performance probably suffers because you're trying to do too many things, too many irons in the fire.
[01:28:22.751 --> 01:28:24.411]  We need you to take action.
[01:28:24.451 --> 01:28:25.552]  The answer is in the mirror.
[01:28:26.392 --> 01:28:26.973]  Look in the mirror.
[01:28:27.773 --> 01:28:29.954]  You'll see the problem and the answer and the solution.
[01:28:31.335 --> 01:28:33.176]  So more calls straight ahead.
[01:28:34.417 --> 01:28:34.817]  Stay with us.
[01:28:44.275 --> 01:28:45.395]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.676 --> 01:28:47.296]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.196 --> 01:28:51.037]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:29:54.332 --> 01:29:54.973]  It's a fact.
[01:29:55.193 --> 01:30:02.659]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[01:30:02.799 --> 01:30:11.666]  With never-ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[01:30:11.946 --> 01:30:22.474]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecure debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:30:22.734 --> 01:30:23.194]  We're good to go.
[01:30:50.601 --> 01:30:52.232]  Visit FDRS.org today.
[01:30:54.406 --> 01:30:56.267]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[01:30:56.467 --> 01:30:59.508]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[01:30:59.748 --> 01:31:04.390]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:31:04.730 --> 01:31:07.352]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[01:31:07.612 --> 01:31:12.474]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing that the major oil companies have run.
[01:31:12.694 --> 01:31:14.475]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[01:31:14.675 --> 01:31:20.397]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[01:31:20.657 --> 01:31:22.358]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[01:31:22.838 --> 01:31:26.661]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[01:31:27.101 --> 01:31:38.107]  SFR recently ran this ad, and the response from all over the United States was so strong that they are allowing my listeners to buy one at their regular price of $9.95 and get another one free of charge.
[01:31:38.508 --> 01:31:43.571]  If you are not completely delighted with the savings, SFR will refund the purchase price and shipping.
[01:31:43.791 --> 01:31:46.812]  Share in the oil company's secret and get SFR now.
[01:31:46.832 --> 01:31:47.293]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[01:31:49.694 --> 01:31:52.877]  That's 888-USE-SFR1 today.
[01:31:56.860 --> 01:32:02.886]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:32:03.486 --> 01:32:06.469]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:21.288 --> 01:32:28.491]  Alright, I'm going to continue with your calls, but we did play that incredible CNN report confirming what I told you two years ago.
[01:32:30.632 --> 01:32:39.777]  That a consortium of thousands of the Fortune, you know, top couple thousand Fortune companies, some are even smaller, getting in on it.
[01:32:39.797 --> 01:32:42.098]  You can go look at the list of them that are funding all this.
[01:32:43.258 --> 01:32:44.559]  The Mexican government, the U.S.
[01:32:44.599 --> 01:32:46.620]  government, international organizations,
[01:32:47.489 --> 01:32:51.010]  Are coming in lobbying legislatures at the state level.
[01:32:51.530 --> 01:32:55.071]  Lobbying the counties, the townships, the city councils, the cities.
[01:32:57.051 --> 01:33:03.433]  Remember about a year ago there was an AP article and then a couple others with the headlines about banks get behind immigrants.
[01:33:04.513 --> 01:33:10.094]  You would read it and it would say over 800 lenders met at a conference and decided to help immigrants.
[01:33:11.053 --> 01:33:16.235]  And that's why, with no identification, they're issuing them identification.
[01:33:16.455 --> 01:33:22.897]  And then here in Austin, Vicente Fox, remember three years ago, it's all on video, online at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:33:22.957 --> 01:33:26.238]  It's also in Battle for the Republic, the extra on the in-game DVD.
[01:33:26.778 --> 01:33:33.220]  He came to town to give an award to Wells Fargo, the Austin police chief, and the legislature for not following the law.
[01:33:33.260 --> 01:33:34.000]  They actually said it.
[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:37.781]  And then Wells Fargo and all the other banks have done this now, all the big ones,
[01:33:38.917 --> 01:33:41.398]  Issue a debit card under any name they want.
[01:33:41.958 --> 01:33:42.418]  Literally.
[01:33:43.478 --> 01:33:45.758]  And then that is accepted by the government.
[01:33:46.198 --> 01:33:47.839]  And that is accepted for welfare.
[01:33:48.819 --> 01:33:50.839]  Or they will accept consular matriculars.
[01:33:51.579 --> 01:33:54.400]  And the legislature of Colorado has done this.
[01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:57.201]  This is like four years ago.
[01:33:57.361 --> 01:33:59.441]  I had the, you know, almost five.
[01:33:59.561 --> 01:34:04.442]  I had the head of the Republican Senate at the time on my radio show out of Colorado.
[01:34:07.319 --> 01:34:18.249]  And he came on the show, and he talked about how his office, he went down personally, and in six hours got four different consulate matriculas under fake names.
[01:34:18.289 --> 01:34:18.810]  They were $25 apiece.
[01:34:21.636 --> 01:34:22.657]  I mean, you walk in.
[01:34:22.997 --> 01:34:31.422]  They've got offices in Austin, offices in Denver, offices in L.A., San Diego, Chicago, Dallas, Fort Worth, New York, every major city.
[01:34:31.442 --> 01:34:35.645]  If your city's got over a million people, and some even, they're even open sub-offices now.
[01:34:35.685 --> 01:34:36.966]  I haven't looked in a while to see the numbers.
[01:34:36.986 --> 01:34:37.586]  I know it was over 100.
[01:34:38.467 --> 01:34:41.129]  They open these, quote, consulates.
[01:34:42.890 --> 01:34:43.810]  No, they call them missions.
[01:34:43.830 --> 01:34:45.812]  The consulate is in federal cities.
[01:34:47.193 --> 01:34:49.454]  They open these Mexican missions is what they call them.
[01:34:50.359 --> 01:34:51.340]  Missions from the government.
[01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:55.123]  They even have one in Laredo.
[01:34:56.604 --> 01:35:00.627]  And then across the river is the sister city, really the same city, Nuevo Laredo.
[01:35:02.068 --> 01:35:02.989]  So they're everywhere.
[01:35:03.750 --> 01:35:04.891]  And this is just Mexico.
[01:35:05.611 --> 01:35:09.374]  But literally, you walk in, they just give you ID cards.
[01:35:10.455 --> 01:35:15.919]  Now with that ID card, housing loans, bank accounts, welfare, they give you Social Security cards instantly.
[01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:17.500]  Instantly.
[01:35:18.641 --> 01:35:19.402]  Go check into it.
[01:35:20.174 --> 01:35:48.546]  You know, I talked about this five-plus years ago because I got a couple bank accounts for business, and I remember setting one of them up, and I was sitting in one of the biggest banks in the U.S., you know, one of the biggest chains, and I'm sitting in there off of Old Torf, right down the street from my office, one of the biggest offices in Austin, and I noticed that they had probably ten tellers, and they had four or five bankers back in the back room with their little cubicles,
[01:35:49.358 --> 01:35:50.959]  And I noticed, you know, the illegal aliens.
[01:35:51.899 --> 01:35:53.020]  You know, hard-working folks.
[01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:55.121]  I'm not attacking these people, but you could tell they were illegal aliens.
[01:35:55.141 --> 01:35:56.382]  They were wearing the cowboy hats.
[01:35:57.542 --> 01:36:00.304]  You know, they had concrete on their boots.
[01:36:00.904 --> 01:36:02.165]  They'd even come in with their wives.
[01:36:02.185 --> 01:36:03.425]  Sometimes they'd come in with four or five kids.
[01:36:03.445 --> 01:36:05.186]  They'd be sitting in just a place full of these people.
[01:36:06.027 --> 01:36:07.688]  And I would watch.
[01:36:08.368 --> 01:36:09.028]  They'd walk over.
[01:36:09.068 --> 01:36:10.709]  They'd be at the desk five minutes.
[01:36:12.150 --> 01:36:12.810]  And I would watch.
[01:36:12.830 --> 01:36:13.811]  They weren't giving them IDs.
[01:36:13.831 --> 01:36:14.551]  They weren't giving them anything.
[01:36:14.571 --> 01:36:16.112]  They'd give them copies of paychecks.
[01:36:17.252 --> 01:36:17.613]  Boom.
[01:36:17.713 --> 01:36:18.313]  Bank accounts.
[01:36:19.258 --> 01:36:25.100]  And then I waited and waited and waited because they had like two lines for English speakers.
[01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:32.222]  And I was probably there an hour, drinking coffee, watching this.
[01:36:33.442 --> 01:36:35.963]  And then I walk up and the person's rude to me.
[01:36:36.983 --> 01:36:38.584]  They asked for three forms of ID.
[01:36:40.264 --> 01:36:41.865]  They asked me questions about the business.
[01:36:43.190 --> 01:36:45.391]  They say I've got to talk to somebody.
[01:36:45.411 --> 01:36:47.292]  I have to get in another line, wait to talk to a banker.
[01:36:47.792 --> 01:36:53.794]  And then they ask me all these questions, and I say, hey, I'm noticing over here that stuff's going on.
[01:36:54.094 --> 01:36:55.755]  You're asking me more, asking for more ID.
[01:36:59.042 --> 01:37:03.005]  You're asking for a thumbprint to go on record, but I'm watching right next to me.
[01:37:03.665 --> 01:37:07.047]  And they said, well, sir, we have a special needs division here.
[01:37:07.548 --> 01:37:13.131]  Now that very same main branch, main customer branch of Bank of America, huge.
[01:37:13.912 --> 01:37:14.812]  It's all Spanish.
[01:37:14.832 --> 01:37:15.893]  There's nothing in English.
[01:37:16.413 --> 01:37:16.754]  Nothing.
[01:37:18.715 --> 01:37:19.075]  Nada.
[01:37:22.698 --> 01:37:26.340]  And you go in there, it's like you're a third-class citizen, not even a second-class citizen.
[01:37:28.488 --> 01:37:32.270]  And I've told the story about there's these Arabs out on a pontoon boat.
[01:37:32.310 --> 01:37:33.831]  I'm out with one of my friends on his boat.
[01:37:36.493 --> 01:37:36.813]  There.
[01:37:40.836 --> 01:37:42.477]  Pontoon boat's in the middle of Lake Travis.
[01:37:42.517 --> 01:37:43.057]  Broke down.
[01:37:44.478 --> 01:37:45.359]  They're begging for help.
[01:37:45.419 --> 01:37:46.159]  It's so rough.
[01:37:46.219 --> 01:37:48.400]  There's like, you know, three foot waves in the middle of the lake.
[01:37:48.420 --> 01:37:49.661]  There's all these wakes coming together.
[01:37:49.701 --> 01:37:50.482]  Oh, it was a busy day.
[01:37:51.302 --> 01:37:52.283]  And I go, oh, I'd like to swim.
[01:37:52.303 --> 01:37:53.023]  I'll jump in.
[01:37:53.183 --> 01:37:53.624]  Jump in.
[01:37:53.644 --> 01:37:55.004]  I've already been swimming.
[01:37:55.205 --> 01:37:55.645]  Swim over.
[01:37:55.665 --> 01:37:57.326]  And I start climbing up the side of the pontoon boat.
[01:37:58.331 --> 01:38:07.737]  Slip, my hand falls between the hinge of the door and literally, like deboning a chicken, just rips it all off.
[01:38:07.777 --> 01:38:09.098]  All the meat is hanging and dangling.
[01:38:09.138 --> 01:38:11.099]  I pull it, kind of stick it back on the finger.
[01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:13.780]  Swim over.
[01:38:14.681 --> 01:38:16.302]  Climb back up, one-handed into the boat.
[01:38:17.963 --> 01:38:19.424]  Driving, we call on the cell phone.
[01:38:20.705 --> 01:38:22.846]  Go driving fast into the marina.
[01:38:22.866 --> 01:38:25.127]  People come up running, screaming that we were sending a wake in the boat.
[01:38:25.147 --> 01:38:26.768]  So I start screaming at them, yelling at them.
[01:38:26.788 --> 01:38:27.849]  A few profanities.
[01:38:28.678 --> 01:38:29.779]  Blood's pouring out everywhere.
[01:38:31.019 --> 01:38:32.240]  Dumbly called an ambulance.
[01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:32.800]  It comes.
[01:38:33.421 --> 01:38:35.162]  Straps me down these windy roads.
[01:38:35.182 --> 01:38:35.962]  I'm going to sit up.
[01:38:36.342 --> 01:38:37.603]  They make me nauseous driving.
[01:38:38.383 --> 01:38:40.745]  They drive 40 miles an hour, so it's not life-threatening.
[01:38:40.765 --> 01:38:42.125]  They don't even go the speed limit.
[01:38:43.066 --> 01:38:45.167]  I get there, and I walk in and start waiting an hour.
[01:38:45.988 --> 01:38:51.190]  And I'm watching Legal Aliens in the cowboy hats and the boots, and they know they don't have ID.
[01:38:51.210 --> 01:38:51.951]  They know they don't have it.
[01:38:51.971 --> 01:38:52.691]  The city's admitted.
[01:38:52.711 --> 01:38:54.052]  They just immediately serve them.
[01:38:56.428 --> 01:38:58.509]  Finally, I start going, hey, I need to see a doctor.
[01:38:58.529 --> 01:38:59.530]  And they go, well, well, you know.
[01:38:59.850 --> 01:39:01.911]  I see all these people with stomach aches and whatever.
[01:39:02.972 --> 01:39:04.853]  Basically, they just get their doctor's checkups there.
[01:39:05.333 --> 01:39:07.815]  People look totally well just being ushered in.
[01:39:07.855 --> 01:39:08.455]  It's a Sunday.
[01:39:08.475 --> 01:39:10.256]  There's nothing but illegal aliens in there, literally.
[01:39:10.716 --> 01:39:12.938]  I got blood soaking up rag after rag.
[01:39:13.578 --> 01:39:14.699]  I want to get my finger fixed.
[01:39:14.739 --> 01:39:15.739]  It's still numb to this day.
[01:39:15.759 --> 01:39:24.124]  Because I know if you sever a finger, you need to get it put back on the nerve, reattach quick, or you'll lose it.
[01:39:26.629 --> 01:39:29.910]  And finally I got to go over and start threatening them.
[01:39:29.930 --> 01:39:31.010]  Hey, I'm a radio talk show.
[01:39:31.130 --> 01:39:31.990]  Yeah, we know who you are.
[01:39:32.010 --> 01:39:35.831]  And I said, listen, I'm really going to talk about this.
[01:39:35.891 --> 01:39:36.971]  I said, you get me a doctor.
[01:39:36.991 --> 01:39:39.612]  And I see all these illegal aliens getting service before me.
[01:39:40.352 --> 01:39:43.853]  And I said, you get my finger back on right now.
[01:39:45.253 --> 01:39:48.714]  And I said, I'm giving you 10 minutes and I'm leaving here and I'm going to talk about how I didn't get service.
[01:39:49.374 --> 01:39:50.634]  And all of a sudden the doctor comes forward.
[01:39:50.654 --> 01:39:51.314]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[01:39:51.334 --> 01:39:52.134]  Yeah, I know your show.
[01:39:52.514 --> 01:39:53.775]  Sorry, let me come back here.
[01:39:54.175 --> 01:39:55.295]  Let me give you a tetanus shot.
[01:39:55.335 --> 01:39:55.675]  I said, no.
[01:39:57.518 --> 01:40:03.523]  And they swabbed out the skin, the finger, put it back on, stitched it up, did all this stuff.
[01:40:05.145 --> 01:40:09.048]  But the point is, is that I am living being scum slave.
[01:40:09.829 --> 01:40:11.750]  I am living being back of the bus.
[01:40:11.890 --> 01:40:13.752]  I am living being a nothing.
[01:40:14.933 --> 01:40:16.654]  The New Old Order hates these illegal aliens.
[01:40:17.315 --> 01:40:19.437]  The Mexican elite calls them cockroaches down there.
[01:40:19.457 --> 01:40:21.058]  I think they're human beings.
[01:40:21.639 --> 01:40:22.559]  I know they're good people.
[01:40:22.579 --> 01:40:24.821]  I know they've been filled full of hate of America.
[01:40:24.861 --> 01:40:25.702]  They're nationalistic.
[01:40:28.348 --> 01:40:30.849]  I know they've been told that we stole it all from them, which is a bunch of bull.
[01:40:34.470 --> 01:40:36.131]  But I understand what's happening.
[01:40:36.611 --> 01:40:37.552]  This is globalization.
[01:40:37.572 --> 01:40:38.552]  This is the end of the country.
[01:40:39.612 --> 01:40:41.093]  And this is the bankrupting of the states.
[01:40:43.574 --> 01:40:53.918]  And when you have the illegal aliens above the law, but then a huge spying, police state, nanny state mechanisms
[01:40:55.459 --> 01:40:59.160]  Expanding, we've been in place for decades, over our lives.
[01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:09.642]  And if you try to have an unpermanent march in most areas of the country, they'll beat you with an inch of your life, spray babies with pepper spray, beat your head in with a billy club.
[01:41:09.962 --> 01:41:12.643]  But the illegal aliens, they're just literally gods.
[01:41:13.843 --> 01:41:15.303]  Because they're a protected group.
[01:41:15.363 --> 01:41:23.765]  You have the banks openly saying, we are giving them housing loans, we are giving them car loans, we are giving them whatever they want with no credit, no nothing.
[01:41:26.110 --> 01:41:27.972]  Even more than what citizens got.
[01:41:29.514 --> 01:41:31.497]  And it's said it's to help them stay here.
[01:41:32.678 --> 01:41:33.119]  And I knew.
[01:41:34.031 --> 01:41:40.192]  And then I went and Googled key names from that banking conference, and I found out exactly what I knew would be there, because I don't know about their plan.
[01:41:40.432 --> 01:41:44.353]  They were saying, well, the economy's going to get bad, and credit's going to get restricted.
[01:41:44.393 --> 01:41:52.054]  It's going to really put pressure on our immigrant populations, and there's going to be more pressure against them, and we want to keep them here, so let's get them entrenched now.
[01:41:52.414 --> 01:41:54.135]  Then they freeze the interest.
[01:41:54.515 --> 01:41:56.335]  They're going to have deals to keep them in their homes.
[01:41:56.355 --> 01:41:59.056]  I mean, here's an example of how strategic and big this plan is.
[01:41:59.076 --> 01:42:00.796]  I've told this story five times, but it's important.
[01:42:02.136 --> 01:42:04.937]  We have family friends that have been friends of my parents since I was three.
[01:42:06.818 --> 01:42:15.921]  And the lady manages the biggest apartment complex in Austin for the biggest apartment property management company in the nation.
[01:42:15.961 --> 01:42:16.562]  I'll just say that.
[01:42:16.802 --> 01:42:19.343]  Who has one of their main corporate offices in Dallas, Texas.
[01:42:20.043 --> 01:42:23.784]  About three years ago, she went to the corporate meetings for a week in Dallas.
[01:42:24.245 --> 01:42:28.446]  These were closed door rooms with a thousand plus people in it.
[01:42:28.626 --> 01:42:30.047]  All their local managers.
[01:42:30.948 --> 01:42:47.299]  And they told them, we have signed a secret deal, you're not to tell anybody this, you're not to tell tenants this, with the federal government where they are going to let us be tax-free in entire complexes if more than half of the complex is government housing.
[01:42:47.319 --> 01:42:53.703]  But we don't want people to know it's government housing, and so this is how we want to kick the regular people out.
[01:42:53.723 --> 01:42:57.926]  These are pretty nice mid-level apartment complexes, one-bedroom, two-bedroom, three-bedrooms.
[01:42:59.033 --> 01:43:00.074]  The one she used to manage.
[01:43:00.094 --> 01:43:01.214]  She manages a couple, but the big one.
[01:43:01.554 --> 01:43:02.355]  It used to be pretty nice.
[01:43:02.395 --> 01:43:04.856]  It's now a crime-ridden cesspit, by the way.
[01:43:04.876 --> 01:43:05.397]  I've been over there.
[01:43:07.077 --> 01:43:11.860]  They said, but the main group we want is the immigrants, the illegal immigrants.
[01:43:12.020 --> 01:43:13.281]  Let them not have ID.
[01:43:13.361 --> 01:43:14.462]  Let them do whatever they want.
[01:43:14.542 --> 01:43:17.043]  She was telling me this over dinner for like an hour at my parents' house.
[01:43:21.245 --> 01:43:22.026]  She said she couldn't believe it.
[01:43:22.046 --> 01:43:23.206]  It was everything I'd been talking about.
[01:43:24.047 --> 01:43:24.887]  And it was all for money.
[01:43:24.907 --> 01:43:27.849]  They're bringing in money by the feds to do this.
[01:43:28.576 --> 01:43:32.097]  It's like they incentivize with tax deals and grants to move offshore.
[01:43:32.978 --> 01:43:44.922]  And they said, if one of your regular tenants, and they even said a middle-income citizen, has a grandmother visiting for a week, we want you to watch them.
[01:43:46.203 --> 01:43:48.083]  We want you to send them a threatening letter.
[01:43:48.283 --> 01:43:48.764]  Find them.
[01:43:48.824 --> 01:43:49.564]  Try to get them out.
[01:43:50.324 --> 01:43:52.925]  Until we get up to 51% government housing.
[01:43:52.945 --> 01:43:55.406]  But don't let anyone know it's government housing.
[01:43:56.821 --> 01:44:01.005]  And we don't care if a one-bedroom has ten illegals in it.
[01:44:01.405 --> 01:44:03.867]  That will accelerate moving the other people out.
[01:44:03.927 --> 01:44:09.312]  They are literally making room, forcibly, for the third-world populations.
[01:44:09.772 --> 01:44:13.696]  This is cold-blooded treason.
[01:44:13.916 --> 01:44:14.616]  But it's not treason.
[01:44:14.636 --> 01:44:15.397]  They're international.
[01:44:17.058 --> 01:44:18.119]  This is their corporate plan.
[01:44:18.159 --> 01:44:21.102]  Blow out middle classes that want liberty, want free market, want liberty.
[01:44:21.582 --> 01:44:22.363]  Come in, loot out...
[01:44:23.024 --> 01:44:28.226]  Through the legislatures, through the federal legislature, shuck off everybody, shut up a police state.
[01:44:28.426 --> 01:44:36.348]  They have to have a police state to take their pension funds, so you can't resist, so you can't stand up, so that there's nothing you can do.
[01:44:38.408 --> 01:44:40.929]  So the banks are saying the illegals are above the law.
[01:44:43.250 --> 01:44:47.271]  The whole system is doing this.
[01:44:53.300 --> 01:44:55.321]  The banks are saying they can do whatever they want.
[01:44:55.582 --> 01:44:57.543]  The banks are letting them live by a second set of rules.
[01:44:57.583 --> 01:44:58.924]  The police have been all over the news.
[01:44:59.404 --> 01:45:02.126]  800 plus sanctuary cities saying they don't arrest them for no insurance.
[01:45:02.546 --> 01:45:05.928]  DWI, they do, they just get let go on average $55 fines.
[01:45:08.550 --> 01:45:16.355]  Cops have admitted to me they'll arrest you for not having a driver's license or having one that's expired, but they don't, illegals, because they've been told not to do it.
[01:45:16.995 --> 01:45:17.816]  It's been all over the news.
[01:45:19.897 --> 01:45:20.878]  That's what tyranny is.
[01:45:22.913 --> 01:45:28.536]  All these legislatures come out and say, we're going to give immigrants more tuition than in-state citizens get.
[01:45:30.777 --> 01:45:39.682]  It's all about coddling them, doing everything they can, subsidizing them with welfare that the middle class pays for, because the illegals aren't really living on five, six bucks an hour.
[01:45:41.002 --> 01:45:43.183]  At the meatpacking plants where you used to get 18 or 20.
[01:45:43.324 --> 01:45:45.805]  Especially with dollar devaluation.
[01:45:47.246 --> 01:45:47.906]  They're not doing that.
[01:45:47.946 --> 01:45:48.586]  Truck drivers.
[01:45:49.166 --> 01:45:50.927]  Truck drivers used to get 20 bucks an hour, now they're getting 10, 12, 13.
[01:45:53.337 --> 01:45:53.797]  Eight dollars.
[01:45:53.817 --> 01:45:54.858]  See, it's plunging, plunging.
[01:45:55.278 --> 01:45:57.018]  As the dollars evaluate at the same time.
[01:45:58.459 --> 01:46:04.041]  The illegal aliens, they're allowed to have three, four, five, six, seven, eight social security cards.
[01:46:04.061 --> 01:46:05.601]  They're allowed to have everything they want.
[01:46:06.581 --> 01:46:09.082]  They're allowed to be on all the welfare they want.
[01:46:09.562 --> 01:46:12.463]  The children are instantly made citizens.
[01:46:13.164 --> 01:46:18.065]  The, on average, $12,000 per birth to city hospitals are allowed.
[01:46:18.305 --> 01:46:20.486]  The CPS predominantly leaves their children alone.
[01:46:23.399 --> 01:46:25.299]  But it's a reign of terror against the citizens.
[01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:28.160]  So again, one more time, I want to play this Lou Dobbs clip.
[01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:30.221]  Play that Lou Dobbs clip one more time.
[01:46:30.261 --> 01:46:30.721]  Listen to this.
[01:46:30.981 --> 01:46:33.161]  A hundred million dollars for the U.S.
[01:46:33.201 --> 01:46:44.524]  government, corporations, the Mexican government, to brainwash the public in a huge PR campaign that's mean and evil to the poor, poor immigrants if we don't let more than 30 million come in.
[01:46:46.225 --> 01:46:52.286]  The battle over illegal immigration is about to become the subject of a multi-million dollar advertising campaign in this country.
[01:46:53.081 --> 01:46:56.405]  And guess who may be paying for a large part of that?
[01:46:56.505 --> 01:46:57.266]  You'll never guess.
[01:46:57.807 --> 01:46:59.048]  The government of Mexico!
[01:46:59.589 --> 01:46:59.930]  A U.S.
[01:46:59.990 --> 01:47:10.743]  advertising executive says he's close to a deal with the Mexican government to help fund a $100 million ad campaign that would be pushing, you guessed it, amnesty for illegal aliens.
[01:47:11.263 --> 01:47:12.565]  Casey Wyan has our report.
[01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:15.761]  Lobbying groups for the U.S.
[01:47:15.821 --> 01:47:27.087]  construction, agriculture, and other industries with large illegal alien workforces are funding a series of pro-amnesty TV ads scheduled to air after this year's presidential convention.
[01:47:27.627 --> 01:47:37.613]  And Mexican government funding for the ad campaign is, quote, a very, very strong possibility, says the executive director of Nat.org, Mexicans and Americans Thinking Together.
[01:47:38.113 --> 01:47:41.035]  It's hoping to raise $100 million for the ad campaign.
[01:47:41.955 --> 01:47:47.778]  Now again, these are very aggressive groups that use race, that use region, that use nationality as a weapon.
[01:48:08.713 --> 01:48:09.714]  We're good to go.
[01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:33.603]  This is literally an industrial scale, bring down, take down.
[01:48:34.123 --> 01:48:34.944]  This is the big one.
[01:48:34.964 --> 01:48:42.069]  They've already got enough illegals here to destroy the middle class, blow out all the states, bankrupt the welfare systems, the hospitals for federalization.
[01:48:43.430 --> 01:48:52.396]  But this is the full decapitation to then just total capitulation to overrun with even more illegals where there's just nothing that can be done and it's all over.
[01:48:54.077 --> 01:48:59.041]  Also, as big a target as whites, blacks in this country is Hispanic Americans.
[01:49:00.422 --> 01:49:03.364]  They're the main target of how, oh, Hispanics stick together.
[01:49:03.384 --> 01:49:04.304]  They're for open borders.
[01:49:04.844 --> 01:49:08.646]  But you talk to Hispanics who are citizens, they go, oh, no, I'm losing my wages.
[01:49:08.686 --> 01:49:09.687]  I'm not making as much money.
[01:49:10.407 --> 01:49:11.388]  Things are falling apart.
[01:49:12.868 --> 01:49:13.629]  See how that works?
[01:49:14.249 --> 01:49:24.994]  So that matter of almost 70% in major polls, some cases higher, that Hispanics are against it, it's the illusion that everyone is for open borders but some evil white supremacist.
[01:49:27.075 --> 01:49:29.937]  See, this is a massive public push
[01:49:31.065 --> 01:49:33.887]  The Mexican government already has done this the last two years in a row.
[01:49:34.247 --> 01:49:37.609]  Now you're finally the third year hearing about it on CNN.
[01:49:37.669 --> 01:49:41.411]  All right, I promise we're going to go to your calls when we get back.
[01:49:41.451 --> 01:49:42.451]  I'm going to take a ton of your calls.
[01:49:42.791 --> 01:49:44.212]  Got a bunch of other news to cover as well.
[01:49:44.232 --> 01:49:44.292]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:49:44.312 --> 01:49:44.412]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:49:44.432 --> 01:49:44.692]  Stay with us.
[01:49:54.227 --> 01:49:55.128]  Storable food.
[01:49:55.348 --> 01:49:56.208]  Storable food.

[01:50:15.902 --> 01:50:18.583]  The entire planet should make this a staple food in their diet.
[01:50:18.723 --> 01:50:22.506]  The seeds will scrape the colon wall, the powder will feed the body vital minerals,
[01:50:24.147 --> 01:50:24.867]  We're good to go.

[01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:14.288]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[01:51:14.668 --> 01:51:18.230]  And the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:51:18.610 --> 01:51:21.792]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[01:51:22.012 --> 01:51:23.733]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[01:51:23.773 --> 01:51:29.517]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[01:51:54.449 --> 01:51:58.730]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:51:58.990 --> 01:52:03.891]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:52:04.091 --> 01:52:05.412]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:52:05.592 --> 01:52:08.952]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[01:53:14.816 --> 01:53:16.537]  Everybody knows the good guys lost.
[01:53:20.020 --> 01:53:21.200]  Welcome back.
[01:53:21.220 --> 01:53:23.441]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:53:23.681 --> 01:53:30.663]  I'm about to go straight to Robert, Tommy, Mark, Ken, Jeremy, all of you.
[01:53:44.535 --> 01:53:48.397]  Just to show I can do it, I'm going to take 25 calls in the next hour at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:53:48.417 --> 01:54:07.171]  Before I do that, Eat Foods Direct is still going to have great prices next month, but because of inflation, because of the dollar devaluation, now they're admitting all that's happening, years after, of course, it was irreversible, food prices are going to go up in just nine days.
[01:54:08.252 --> 01:54:12.235]  They've got enough food supply right now, pre-packed, freeze-dried, high-quality food,
[01:54:13.123 --> 01:54:13.483]  We're good to go.
[01:54:13.503 --> 01:54:13.643]  I think?
[01:54:39.759 --> 01:54:40.439]  In nine days.

[01:54:56.624 --> 01:54:57.844]  Five months free right now.
[01:54:58.444 --> 01:54:59.804]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:54:59.944 --> 01:55:00.465]  Check it out.
[01:55:01.405 --> 01:55:02.805]  Okay, let's go to your calls.
[01:55:03.225 --> 01:55:04.646]  Let's talk to Robert in Connecticut.
[01:55:04.666 --> 01:55:05.506]  Thanks for holding, Robert.
[01:55:06.266 --> 01:55:07.066]  Hi, how you doing?
[01:55:07.226 --> 01:55:07.846]  Good, sir.
[01:55:08.086 --> 01:55:09.367]  Good to hear your voice over there.
[01:55:09.447 --> 01:55:14.608]  Thank you very much for all your hard work in helping us bring this country back to where it belongs.
[01:55:15.428 --> 01:55:24.531]  One thing I want to talk to you about is, you know, I've been listening to everything you've got to say, and I've been following this New World Order thing for a while, and it eerily sounds like everything written in the Iron Mountain Report.
[01:55:24.591 --> 01:55:25.911]  I'm not sure if you're familiar with that.
[01:55:25.951 --> 01:55:28.012]  I want to know your comments on it, if you could share that.
[01:55:28.112 --> 01:55:29.172]  I'm familiar with it.
[01:55:29.192 --> 01:55:32.973]  That's never been absolutely confirmed to be a government document, but I don't doubt that it is.
[01:55:34.057 --> 01:55:37.799]  Or somebody took all these other government documents that we have pieces of it and put them together.
[01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:41.280]  Yeah, that's pretty interesting.
[01:55:41.300 --> 01:55:41.780]  I read about it.
[01:55:41.800 --> 01:55:54.806]  I mean, it's got everything about Mexico and illegal immigration and everything else, and it's just so immensely frustrating to live and work in this country and try and just support a family and do everything the right way, and then you realize that, you know, we...
[01:55:55.546 --> 01:55:56.787]  Well, here's an example.
[01:55:56.807 --> 01:55:59.790]  This weekend I stayed at the Hyatt Regency and I had Jim Mars and St.
[01:55:59.850 --> 01:56:02.252]  John Hunt there because it was actually...
[01:56:22.782 --> 01:56:27.006]  Cheaper than any of the other surrounding hotels, but it was still $150 a night.
[01:56:28.107 --> 01:56:31.669]  And it's right on the grassy knoll, so we could shoot interviews on the roof and other places.
[01:56:33.851 --> 01:56:35.853]  They were rude to me when they got my luggage.
[01:56:36.153 --> 01:56:37.374]  They were rude to everybody else.
[01:56:37.414 --> 01:56:38.835]  They were rude behind the counter.
[01:56:39.336 --> 01:56:40.337]  They were rude everywhere.
[01:56:40.357 --> 01:56:41.938]  They treated everybody else like cattle.
[01:56:42.498 --> 01:56:44.200]  Everything is degenerating.
[01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:49.764]  And it just shocked me that a supposedly mid-grade hotel, this is how they were acting.
[01:56:50.145 --> 01:56:51.746]  But it's totally third world.
[01:56:52.165 --> 01:56:52.866]  That's unbelievable.
[01:56:52.906 --> 01:56:54.407]  I read Jim Maher's book, too.
[01:56:54.427 --> 01:56:56.829]  He's got a book on secret societies.
[01:56:56.849 --> 01:57:00.892]  He's got a small section in there about what I'm talking about with his Iron Mountain Report.
[01:57:00.912 --> 01:57:04.576]  Hey, what do you think of the... I'll hold you over if we need to.
[01:57:04.896 --> 01:57:12.903]  What do you think of the Mexican government openly to finance $100 million with our government and the corporations to try to ram through the end of the country?
[01:57:12.923 --> 01:57:15.165]  You know, it's just one thing.
[01:57:15.205 --> 01:57:20.109]  It's just a giant, huge special end which has absolutely no place in America.
[01:57:21.317 --> 01:57:22.338]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[01:57:22.358 --> 01:57:27.401]  The only thing I'd like to add is that we need to get it together.
[01:57:27.721 --> 01:57:30.323]  I took your advice, and I'm running for state representative.
[01:57:30.343 --> 01:57:30.723]  Stay there.
[01:57:30.763 --> 01:57:31.463]  I want to hear about it.
[01:57:31.523 --> 01:57:34.645]  I want to get back.
[01:57:34.665 --> 01:57:36.006]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:57:36.086 --> 01:57:39.729]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:57:50.436 --> 01:57:51.097]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.757 --> 01:57:52.818]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.519 --> 01:57:54.639]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.280 --> 01:57:56.101]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.861 --> 01:57:57.762]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.782 --> 01:58:02.165]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.606 --> 01:58:06.729]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.451 --> 01:58:16.757]  You know, I don't normally get on air and talk bad about service to different companies because that's such a low-level problem compared to all the real crises we face, but
[01:58:18.590 --> 01:58:21.812]  Checking in, I'm real polite, and I'd say, Oh, thank you, yes.
[01:58:22.413 --> 01:58:25.035]  And these girls behind the counter would say, Okay.
[01:58:25.975 --> 01:58:26.216]  Uh-huh.
[01:58:27.737 --> 01:58:28.497]  Give me some ID.
[01:58:29.898 --> 01:58:33.941]  And they just... And I'm sort of watching them with other people checking in.
[01:58:33.961 --> 01:58:35.242]  They were treating them all like dirt.
[01:58:36.903 --> 01:58:38.444]  And that's just how society is.
[01:58:38.504 --> 01:58:40.426]  A bunch of unhappy people.
[01:58:40.486 --> 01:58:41.927]  A bunch of corporate goons.
[01:58:41.947 --> 01:58:46.970]  You know, being mean to them, so they're going to be mean to us.
[01:58:47.071 --> 01:58:47.511]  And it's just...
[01:58:48.326 --> 01:58:51.068]  Even in Texas now, it's just a bunch of rude scum.
[01:58:51.088 --> 01:59:02.477]  I mean, I remember growing up, and I'm born here, families, old Texas families on both sides, but I remember you didn't even wave over a waitress.
[01:59:02.497 --> 01:59:04.318]  You didn't even say, hey, we need some service over here.
[01:59:04.899 --> 01:59:05.819]  You wouldn't dare do that.
[01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:08.782]  Now the waiters and people are rude to you.
[01:59:08.822 --> 01:59:09.682]  You're rude to them.
[01:59:09.702 --> 01:59:14.366]  It's another sign of what it is, and there's just illegal aliens running all over us.
[01:59:14.686 --> 01:59:16.708]  I was watching television, and every other ad was...
[01:59:17.842 --> 01:59:18.363]  We're good to go.
[01:59:38.271 --> 01:59:39.232]  Just flat out.
[01:59:39.432 --> 01:59:41.253]  Cars with Mexican flags all over them.
[01:59:41.293 --> 01:59:43.014]  Just, hey, we're Mexican.
[01:59:43.274 --> 01:59:44.135]  This is Mexico.
[01:59:44.175 --> 01:59:45.475]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[01:59:46.036 --> 01:59:48.237]  And your government is bankrolling us.
[01:59:48.277 --> 01:59:50.338]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[01:59:50.678 --> 01:59:53.120]  It's so much fun to kill America.
[01:59:54.140 --> 01:59:55.661]  Okay, roll your kids' sleeves up.
[01:59:55.701 --> 01:59:56.342]  Take the shot.
[01:59:56.462 --> 01:59:56.942]  Go ahead.
[01:59:57.202 --> 01:59:58.543]  Send them to the Planned Parenthood.
[01:59:58.723 --> 02:00:00.044]  You're getting the gringo.
[02:00:00.284 --> 02:00:00.884]  Let me tell you something.
[02:00:00.904 --> 02:00:03.006]  The gringo is euthanizing you.
[02:00:03.206 --> 02:00:04.687]  The gringo is killing your babies.
[02:00:04.947 --> 02:00:06.908]  The gringo is dumbing your kids down in the schools.
[02:00:09.540 --> 02:00:10.881]  The New World Order runs it.
[02:00:11.181 --> 02:00:12.461]  You're not winning anything.
[02:00:12.741 --> 02:00:14.002]  You're not taking anything over.
[02:00:14.042 --> 02:00:23.205]  You're being used as a tool to turn America into a nation of slaves, of third world agrarian peasants, peons.
[02:00:24.646 --> 02:00:27.667]  Instead of overthrowing Mexico and getting a good government, and I'd support it,
[02:00:28.783 --> 02:00:34.068]  No, they use it as a steam valve to stop revolution down there, to bring down this country, to overrun everything.
[02:00:34.148 --> 02:00:35.890]  I said I would shut up and take your calls.
[02:00:36.790 --> 02:00:46.579]  This issue of actually watching TV with the machismo and the down with America stuff, just in my face, I can't take it anymore!
[02:00:49.181 --> 02:00:55.247]  While you're sticking your children in meat grinders, and the stupid white yuppies who think it's all funny and snicker about it,
[02:00:56.061 --> 02:00:57.002]  You all make me sick.
[02:00:57.642 --> 02:00:59.103]  All right, let's finish up with Robert Connecticut.
[02:00:59.123 --> 02:01:00.464]  I promise I'm going to get to Tommy and everybody else.
[02:01:01.064 --> 02:01:02.145]  Hey, Robert, go ahead and make your point.
[02:01:02.165 --> 02:01:03.066]  You're running for state rep.
[02:01:03.326 --> 02:01:08.789]  And even if you don't win, you're going to educate people on the debates, the meetings, the local stuff up in Connecticut, right?
[02:01:09.290 --> 02:01:11.431]  Well, I'm not even thinking about whether I'm not going to win.
[02:01:11.451 --> 02:01:15.794]  I mean, I'm going door to door, you know, and I'm going to talk to every single person I can.
[02:01:15.814 --> 02:01:18.075]  I mean, the guy I'm running against is such a tyrant.
[02:01:18.096 --> 02:01:18.916]  He's unbelievable.
[02:01:18.956 --> 02:01:24.760]  I mean, I have a quote from him on YouTube where he says, if you have any idiot in this town run against me, I will crush them.
[02:01:25.239 --> 02:01:26.579]  I mean, this is how this guy talks.
[02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:32.502]  And nobody ever runs against him, so I mean, I'm the first person really... What's his name?
[02:01:32.862 --> 02:01:34.122]  What's the name of the YouTube clip?
[02:01:34.762 --> 02:01:35.823]  It's Jim Amon.
[02:01:35.883 --> 02:01:43.806]  All you have to do is just, you know, do a Google of it, and you'll see him at the train station where he's just, you know, compared to the Sopranos.
[02:01:44.206 --> 02:01:45.746]  And I had nothing to do with this clip.
[02:01:45.766 --> 02:01:47.327]  This came after he decided to...
[02:01:48.520 --> 02:01:54.606]  Go against his own party and endorse Joe Lieberman, who's like the biggest warmonger in Connecticut.
[02:01:54.626 --> 02:01:56.608]  The whole war industry loves him here in Connecticut.
[02:01:56.708 --> 02:01:57.769]  We've got Sikorsky.
[02:01:58.249 --> 02:02:04.875]  We've got the submarine factory, an electric boat up in the north end of the state.
[02:02:04.895 --> 02:02:08.258]  We've got all kinds of military companies around here.
[02:02:08.779 --> 02:02:11.181]  He's loved, basically, because he's a hawk.
[02:02:11.521 --> 02:02:12.142]  I hear you now.
[02:02:12.462 --> 02:02:13.063]  Give us your name.
[02:02:13.737 --> 02:02:17.760]  My name is Rocco Frank, and my website, you know, is rfrank118.com.
[02:02:17.820 --> 02:02:19.561]  I'm trying to get rid of fluoride in this state.
[02:02:19.641 --> 02:02:24.585]  I already worked to get rid of MTBE poison from our gasoline, which is a real nightmare.
[02:02:24.605 --> 02:02:27.708]  Give your web address again for coordinates for folks in Connecticut.
[02:02:28.168 --> 02:02:28.368]  Sure.
[02:02:28.388 --> 02:02:29.289]  It's rfrank118.com.
[02:02:30.309 --> 02:02:30.990]  All right.
[02:02:31.290 --> 02:02:32.951]  Good job.
[02:02:32.971 --> 02:02:35.553]  We'll need some fire support over there in the info war.
[02:02:35.613 --> 02:02:36.234]  Give him some help.
[02:02:37.105 --> 02:02:40.153]  Yeah, by the way, the military-industrial complex takes more jobs than it gives.
[02:02:40.534 --> 02:02:43.983]  It destroys ten jobs for every job it gets, and now they're just taking over the country.
[02:02:46.292 --> 02:02:54.235]  For years, you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained the leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.

[02:03:51.757 --> 02:03:53.698]  But in liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:03:53.758 --> 02:03:56.959]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:03:57.279 --> 02:04:02.781]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.

[02:05:56.565 --> 02:05:58.206]  Tommy in Arkansas, thanks for holding.
[02:05:58.226 --> 02:06:00.027]  You're on the air worldwide.
[02:06:00.067 --> 02:06:00.547]  Go ahead.
[02:06:01.508 --> 02:06:02.768]  Hey, thanks for everything you do.
[02:06:03.629 --> 02:06:07.311]  To the guy in Dallas that wanted to know what he could do, get involved in the Ron Paul campaign.
[02:06:08.031 --> 02:06:09.372]  There's a money bomb today.
[02:06:09.392 --> 02:06:11.053]  It's turned into a firecracker.
[02:06:12.013 --> 02:06:22.439]  We need money to finance in through the Super Tuesday advertising, and you can make great leaps and bounds in his progress in this campaign.
[02:06:23.490 --> 02:06:28.613]  People that are listening to this show, you've got friends that aren't as smart, you've got relatives that aren't as smart as they'd be listening to.
[02:06:28.753 --> 02:06:29.333]  Call them up.
[02:06:29.473 --> 02:06:30.333]  Get them involved.
[02:06:30.373 --> 02:06:31.234]  Get people out there.
[02:06:31.274 --> 02:06:32.534]  Tell them to donate today.
[02:06:33.615 --> 02:06:35.015]  Alex, I've got one thing.
[02:06:35.055 --> 02:06:35.796]  Man, you ruin me.
[02:06:35.836 --> 02:06:41.018]  Every time I see that clown gurgling on BNN, I've got to laugh after watching Bohemian Grove.
[02:06:41.098 --> 02:06:42.139]  I'm going, wow, you know.
[02:06:42.759 --> 02:06:44.520]  There's a dude that was running through the woods.
[02:06:45.220 --> 02:06:47.061]  So thank you for what you do.
[02:06:48.281 --> 02:06:49.222]  Trying to get everybody.
[02:06:49.262 --> 02:06:51.763]  I've been working hard campaigning for Ron Paul.
[02:06:53.138 --> 02:06:55.019]  And trying to get people fired up.
[02:06:55.159 --> 02:06:55.760]  Thank you much.
[02:06:56.060 --> 02:06:56.700]  Thank you, sir.
[02:06:56.801 --> 02:06:57.381]  Absolutely.
[02:06:57.461 --> 02:07:00.483]  It is the Martin Luther King Day money bomb.
[02:07:01.624 --> 02:07:12.891]  And I don't like to announce things that are already known to most people, but after New Hampshire and then after some of the other states, quite a bit of the momentum was lost.
[02:07:12.991 --> 02:07:20.356]  It's still the biggest grassroots movement we've seen in the last 50 years against something.
[02:07:20.516 --> 02:07:22.798]  It's waking millions of people up every week.
[02:07:24.133 --> 02:07:25.654]  To the real political issues.
[02:07:27.095 --> 02:07:33.521]  The inflation tax, the New World Order, the war, the private Federal Reserve, all of it.
[02:07:34.782 --> 02:07:43.749]  And we've got stories and links up to give at TheMoneyBombRonPaul2008.com I know some folks around the office today are going to give a small sum.
[02:07:44.230 --> 02:07:45.891]  I know a lot of you are tapped out.
[02:07:46.952 --> 02:07:51.956]  But it is important to go there or the media is really going to make a big deal out of this.
[02:07:52.873 --> 02:07:59.521]  In fact, I'm just going to call Watson up right now because I know that it's our audience that is probably giving 25% of the money.
[02:08:00.002 --> 02:08:01.423]  That's what the Ron Paul campaigns told me.
[02:08:01.443 --> 02:08:02.705]  They've tracked and they believe.
[02:08:03.125 --> 02:08:05.108]  In the first part of his campaign, it was over half.
[02:08:05.588 --> 02:08:09.232]  But as it got bigger, we became a smaller part of that, even though it grew in the aggregate.
[02:08:09.252 --> 02:08:10.814]  It was smaller.
[02:08:10.834 --> 02:08:12.857]  I'm going to call Watson because this can't wait right now.
[02:08:17.173 --> 02:08:23.235]  And I'm going to tell him to do a blurb about, hey, folks, we better get in there and give to the money bomb because people are going to spin this as a big failure.
[02:08:24.116 --> 02:08:26.937]  Even though, you know, he broke the 6.3, went to 6.8.
[02:08:27.637 --> 02:08:34.260]  He raised $4.3 million in just, now hold on a second, Paul.
[02:08:34.600 --> 02:08:41.643]  He raised, thank you, he raised, you know, the 4.3 mil, and now this money bomb that hasn't been promoted a lot,
[02:08:42.043 --> 02:08:42.443]  We're good to go.
[02:09:04.856 --> 02:09:05.117]  I think?
[02:09:21.841 --> 02:09:23.482]  All right, thank you very much, sir.
[02:09:50.168 --> 02:09:50.468]  Thank you.
[02:09:51.188 --> 02:09:52.829]  All right, there you go.
[02:09:52.849 --> 02:09:55.370]  Just letting you know a little bit of behind the scenes here.
[02:09:56.570 --> 02:09:57.090]  Good point.
[02:09:57.110 --> 02:10:00.111]  All right, let's talk to Mark in California.
[02:10:00.171 --> 02:10:00.771]  You're on the air.
[02:10:00.791 --> 02:10:03.152]  Hey, thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[02:10:03.412 --> 02:10:03.772]  Yes, sir.
[02:10:03.792 --> 02:10:05.773]  Hey, we love you guys in California, man.
[02:10:05.833 --> 02:10:06.853]  You're just the bomb.
[02:10:07.668 --> 02:10:16.174]  Hey, you did a wonderful interview with Benjamin Fulford a while back and did some reading on this guy.
[02:10:16.674 --> 02:10:19.056]  Man, he's got such a powerful message.
[02:10:19.076 --> 02:10:21.098]  I was just wondering what your take on this guy was.
[02:10:21.538 --> 02:10:23.139]  I believe he believes what he's saying.
[02:10:23.179 --> 02:10:25.381]  I believe about 90% of what he's saying is accurate.
[02:10:25.461 --> 02:10:27.302]  I can't confirm the other 10% or so.
[02:10:29.630 --> 02:10:34.174]  So, it's, I mean, he definitely does get interviews with the granddaughter of the emperor.
[02:10:34.554 --> 02:10:37.676]  He definitely does get interviews with David Rockefeller, like that, you know, just snap.
[02:10:38.116 --> 02:10:41.299]  He definitely, you know, did leave Forbes on his own because they were censoring him.
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:44.981]  I believe he believes what he's saying.
[02:10:45.081 --> 02:10:47.463]  I mean, I know that the Asians are worried about eugenics.
[02:10:47.543 --> 02:10:52.767]  I know the globalists have launched these ops on them and paid off their governments to carry it out.
[02:10:53.622 --> 02:10:58.586]  I just don't know, then, about his stuff about how they plan to assassinate New World Order people if it continues.
[02:10:59.326 --> 02:11:01.307]  I don't particularly even like that kind of talk.
[02:11:01.848 --> 02:11:08.212]  I think we should be nonviolent as far as we can because the enemy wants to overturn the chessboard and make it violent and go to the next level.
[02:11:08.992 --> 02:11:13.796]  But he's got enough attention and been covered nationally that we've had him here three times, so you can decide.
[02:11:14.896 --> 02:11:15.357]  Right on, man.
[02:11:15.377 --> 02:11:15.837]  Thanks a lot.
[02:11:16.517 --> 02:11:16.858]  Thank you.
[02:11:16.898 --> 02:11:17.898]  I appreciate the call, Mark.
[02:11:18.038 --> 02:11:19.560]  Ken in Mass, you're on the air.
[02:11:19.620 --> 02:11:20.000]  Go ahead.
[02:11:20.020 --> 02:11:21.121]  Hello.
[02:11:21.401 --> 02:11:21.601]  Hi.
[02:11:21.621 --> 02:11:22.802]  How are you doing, Alex?
[02:11:22.942 --> 02:11:23.142]  Good.
[02:11:24.284 --> 02:11:28.449]  Yeah, I wanted to talk a little bit about Aaron Russo's film, Freedom to Fascism.
[02:11:29.711 --> 02:11:43.827]  I heard Catherine Albrecht speaking about him a couple weeks ago, and she thought it was a good idea to maybe have some kind of a Freedom to Fascism-type bomb, getting it in disc form and getting it out to...
[02:11:46.410 --> 02:11:47.530]  Well, that is going on.
[02:11:47.730 --> 02:11:48.650]  That is going on.
[02:11:49.191 --> 02:11:52.032]  But it's not something you can search at a central location.
[02:11:52.052 --> 02:12:02.636]  I mean, it's number two and number one off and on for the last couple of weeks on Google Video, to the point they even took the video link off their main page, which was one of their most popular categories.
[02:12:04.500 --> 02:12:13.426]  It's been trading places with Terror Storm and Endgame and Martial Law in the top five for the last two, three weeks, because it's three weeks now.
[02:12:14.306 --> 02:12:19.409]  Terror Storm and Endgame have been number one, trading places with Freedom to Fascism and Zeitgeist.
[02:12:20.030 --> 02:12:21.010]  And so that's happening.
[02:12:21.030 --> 02:12:23.112]  That's a huge InfoWar bomb right there.
[02:12:24.032 --> 02:12:31.457]  And then we've got the on-the-ground copies of it being made, copies of Endgame, really starting to have a big effect out there.
[02:12:31.537 --> 02:12:33.058]  So don't wait for orders from headquarters.
[02:12:33.098 --> 02:12:33.458]  Go for it.
[02:12:34.955 --> 02:12:42.244]  I also had an idea that, you know, try to get it on PBS and, you know, maybe some infomercials or something.
[02:12:42.264 --> 02:12:50.875]  You know, I don't have any money to do this kind of stuff, but the Ron Paul campaign, maybe it's a good way to spend some of their advertising money.
[02:12:50.895 --> 02:12:51.916]  You know, probably only...
[02:12:52.597 --> 02:12:55.318]  Less than 5% of the population has seen Freedom to Fascism.
[02:12:55.479 --> 02:12:57.379]  Yeah, I agree, and I appreciate your call.
[02:12:57.960 --> 02:13:02.422]  But not Freedom to Fascism, because there would probably be licensing issues and other things, or maybe some clips out of it.
[02:13:02.442 --> 02:13:04.683]  I just don't know if they could afford two hours on primetime.
[02:13:05.203 --> 02:13:08.665]  Ron Paul, with his war chest, needs to spark something.
[02:13:09.506 --> 02:13:16.669]  And buying time on a primetime cable channel would be a million or two a pop.
[02:13:17.210 --> 02:13:21.572]  He could do one or two of those and maybe buy a 30-minute special
[02:13:22.373 --> 02:13:29.015]  On a Sunday or Saturday evening or maybe sometime like that for $4 or $5 million, like Ross Perot did.
[02:13:29.816 --> 02:13:32.296]  And, yeah, I think they need to do a Hail Mary.
[02:13:32.316 --> 02:13:37.698]  You know, a daring move is always needed because of the buzz and hype it'll create.
[02:13:39.539 --> 02:13:44.441]  Because, you know, you spend $4 million on buying 15, 20, 30, 45 minutes on primetime television.
[02:13:45.961 --> 02:13:46.922]  I've looked into the numbers.
[02:13:47.522 --> 02:13:51.103]  You'll get two or three times that in hype and coverage and news reports on it.
[02:13:51.744 --> 02:13:56.346]  And they need that ahead of Super Tuesday coming up in, what, seven, eight days.
[02:13:57.207 --> 02:13:58.847]  Well, no, that comes later.
[02:13:59.228 --> 02:14:00.908]  I meant Florida coming up on the 29th.
[02:14:02.309 --> 02:14:09.352]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to Jeremy in Illinois.
[02:14:09.372 --> 02:14:09.893]  You're on the air.
[02:14:09.913 --> 02:14:10.573]  Go ahead, Jeremy.
[02:14:10.993 --> 02:14:11.433]  Hey, Alex.
[02:14:11.453 --> 02:14:11.953]  How are you doing?
[02:14:11.973 --> 02:14:12.594]  Good to be with you.
[02:14:12.774 --> 02:14:13.254]  Good to be with you.
[02:14:13.294 --> 02:14:13.674]  Go ahead.
[02:14:14.195 --> 02:14:16.856]  I've been a big fan of InfoWars for a few years now.
[02:14:17.336 --> 02:14:19.377]  You're doing great things out there in Texas.
[02:14:20.115 --> 02:14:21.595]  Two points I want to make really quick.
[02:14:22.776 --> 02:14:25.917]  I wanted to plug the money bomb that's going on today, which you already mentioned.
[02:14:26.537 --> 02:14:31.198]  And I'm calling from the Carbondale, Illinois Ron Paul Campaign Office.
[02:14:31.898 --> 02:14:42.121]  If any of your listeners are in Carbondale or the Jackson County area, come in here within the next hour and a half up to 3 o'clock Central Time and I will match your donation dollar for dollar.
[02:14:43.542 --> 02:14:44.442]  Where are you again?
[02:14:45.202 --> 02:14:48.063]  I'm in Carbondale, Illinois at the Ron Paul Campaign Office.
[02:14:49.119 --> 02:14:49.639]  All right, sir.
[02:14:49.659 --> 02:14:50.600]  I appreciate your call.
[02:14:50.780 --> 02:14:53.502]  Let me just say this, though, because I hear people do this on talk shows everywhere.
[02:14:54.783 --> 02:15:04.570]  They will call in and plug their little local meetup group or the small thing they're doing when just 99% of people aren't going to be in your area, so they're going to think, oh, darn, I can't do that.
[02:15:04.630 --> 02:15:09.574]  Just say, go to ronpaul2008.com and give them money there.
[02:15:10.194 --> 02:15:11.475]  Give them a place they can all go.
[02:15:13.637 --> 02:15:18.080]  Or plug the national meetup groups where they can then say, go to the meetup
[02:15:18.962 --> 02:15:20.502]  I'm sorry, man.
[02:15:20.522 --> 02:15:21.743]  I had a quick thing to tell you.
[02:15:45.317 --> 02:15:56.446]  I know you've talked about TBN a lot, Trinity Broadcasting, and I know some of the preachers are kind of suspect, but I was looking on, are you familiar with Jesse Duplantis, Evangelist?
[02:15:57.807 --> 02:15:58.608]  Yes, I am.
[02:15:58.628 --> 02:16:04.173]  I was looking on his MySpace, and on the front page of his friends, Ron Paul was one of them.
[02:16:04.713 --> 02:16:07.195]  I thought that was a surprise, and then I went to Trinity Broadcasting.
[02:16:07.255 --> 02:16:10.418]  Well, I'm not saying everybody on Trinity Broadcasting is bad.
[02:16:11.788 --> 02:16:15.290]  I'm saying they've been involved, you know, in some bad things.
[02:16:15.990 --> 02:16:26.757]  No, but I was just saying, you know, I'm a Christian, and I see there's the Christian world, who a lot of people I know are not even aware of Ron Paul, and then I'm familiar with the InfraWar and Ron Paul's campaign.
[02:16:27.297 --> 02:16:35.922]  I was just really surprised to see those two worlds cross, you know, with Ron Paul being on the front page of Trinity Broadcasting.
[02:16:36.282 --> 02:16:36.803]  Absolutely.
[02:16:36.863 --> 02:16:37.903]  I thought it was very interesting.
[02:16:37.923 --> 02:16:40.705]  And it also has a spark of just like, wow, if that could...
[02:16:41.372 --> 02:16:43.915]  If more Christians, you know, could get on board with Ron Paul.
[02:16:44.095 --> 02:16:47.259]  I know it's a little bit late in the campaign, but that's really important.
[02:16:47.719 --> 02:16:48.860]  I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[02:16:48.880 --> 02:16:49.741]  You know why they do that?
[02:16:50.282 --> 02:16:53.986]  Pat Robertson, it appeared, was somewhat anti-New World Order until the mid-90s.
[02:16:54.406 --> 02:16:58.650]  The feds came after his tax exemption, and suddenly he totally rolled.
[02:17:00.813 --> 02:17:02.875]  And totally went pro-New World Order from that point on.
[02:17:04.781 --> 02:17:08.644]  And I know Trinity Broadcasting has a big, diverse, even some of the stuff is good on there.
[02:17:08.764 --> 02:17:12.407]  They've even got a thing up there I did check a list or told us about, about eugenics and Planned Parenthood.
[02:17:13.708 --> 02:17:17.471]  And I see some good stuff on there from time to time when I happen to be watching TV five, six times a year.
[02:17:19.072 --> 02:17:22.074]  But, of course they like Ron Paul.
[02:17:22.094 --> 02:17:23.956]  They'd like the government to leave them alone and do whatever they want.
[02:17:24.436 --> 02:17:27.158]  They grovel to the government out of fear for their licenses.
[02:17:28.024 --> 02:17:31.625]  That's why the First Amendment says the government has no power or control over religion.
[02:17:31.805 --> 02:17:32.625]  But you notice they do.
[02:17:32.645 --> 02:17:36.366]  Because they violate the Constitution, Bill of Rights, from one end to the other.
[02:17:37.366 --> 02:17:38.286]  More calls straight ahead.
[02:17:38.306 --> 02:17:38.446]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:17:46.727 --> 02:17:48.148]  It is a big idea.
[02:17:49.208 --> 02:17:50.248]  A new world order.
[02:17:50.968 --> 02:17:55.229]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful government.
[02:17:55.859 --> 02:17:57.621]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[02:17:57.842 --> 02:18:00.926]  Wouldn't their objective be world domination?
[02:18:01.466 --> 02:18:03.930]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:18:04.670 --> 02:18:12.000]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:18:14.992 --> 02:18:19.995]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:18:20.456 --> 02:18:23.918]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:18:24.318 --> 02:18:26.820]  Bill Burr is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:28.041]  Most people have no idea.
[02:18:28.061 --> 02:18:28.821]  They're not after money.
[02:18:28.841 --> 02:18:29.902]  They have all the money they need.
[02:18:30.122 --> 02:18:30.863]  They're after power.
[02:18:31.103 --> 02:18:32.224]  That's what they have to use it for.

[02:19:18.653 --> 02:19:21.496]  Have you been told why the world is more dangerous than ever?
[02:19:22.016 --> 02:19:23.817]  Communist China and Russia are arming.
[02:19:24.398 --> 02:19:27.500]  Both supply the military in South American countries.

[02:20:45.088 --> 02:20:49.671]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[02:20:50.072 --> 02:20:53.013]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[02:20:53.334 --> 02:20:55.895]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[02:20:56.256 --> 02:21:01.079]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[02:21:01.459 --> 02:21:06.823]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[02:21:07.123 --> 02:21:10.105]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act,
[02:21:10.285 --> 02:21:11.446]  This issue is about worship, not economics.
[02:21:33.687 --> 02:21:34.388]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:21:34.428 --> 02:21:35.489]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:57.897 --> 02:22:00.679]  This music reminds me of Mission Impossible and E. Howard Hunt.
[02:22:00.739 --> 02:22:06.564]  I'll tell you a little bit about our trip to Dallas, some of the things we learned before this hour ends, and a bunch of other news.
[02:22:07.044 --> 02:22:09.146]  Right now, I'm keeping my promise to take a lot of your calls.
[02:22:09.186 --> 02:22:10.047]  Let's move quick.
[02:22:10.507 --> 02:22:14.190]  Tom in Colorado, then Omar, Miguel, Ron, Nancy, and others.
[02:22:14.670 --> 02:22:16.271]  Tom, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:22:17.272 --> 02:22:17.953]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:22:17.973 --> 02:22:18.433]  How are you doing?
[02:22:18.613 --> 02:22:18.873]  Good.
[02:22:19.934 --> 02:22:27.360]  Hey, I'm not asking you, I wouldn't ask you to endorse such an action or a concept, but I've been thinking, I've got an idea here.
[02:22:28.544 --> 02:22:33.925]  Let's say we get this chip in our license or in our passport or something like that.
[02:22:33.945 --> 02:22:38.606]  I wonder what would happen if you put it in the microwave for about 15 seconds.
[02:22:38.706 --> 02:22:43.947]  They're making a crime to mess with it, so even when it accidentally breaks, they're going to SWAT team you.
[02:22:44.927 --> 02:22:46.147]  So they got that all?
[02:22:46.167 --> 02:22:48.848]  You've got to have your slave card, unless you're an illegal alien, yeah.
[02:22:50.108 --> 02:22:50.568]  Oh, God.
[02:22:50.908 --> 02:22:53.588]  And they're only a protected group until they help bring down the U.S.
[02:22:54.729 --> 02:22:55.489]  What if we all did it?
[02:22:55.529 --> 02:22:56.549]  They couldn't put us all in jail.
[02:22:57.253 --> 02:23:00.596]  Well, that's right, and it's all going to be selectively enforced, and we can't live in fear anymore.
[02:23:01.717 --> 02:23:02.177]  No, we can't.
[02:23:02.758 --> 02:23:05.360]  And people in the government have to really look at the claims we've made.
[02:23:05.380 --> 02:23:05.961]  They're all true.
[02:23:06.021 --> 02:23:09.664]  It's worse than I can even pronunciate and enunciate.
[02:23:10.765 --> 02:23:11.365]  It's up to you.
[02:23:11.385 --> 02:23:13.127]  I mean, do we really want to be part of this, folks?
[02:23:13.267 --> 02:23:16.069]  Cops, military, lawyers, government people?
[02:23:16.149 --> 02:23:17.110]  I mean, you know it's true.
[02:23:18.511 --> 02:23:18.712]  Yeah.
[02:23:19.752 --> 02:23:20.493]  I appreciate it.
[02:23:20.993 --> 02:23:23.556]  Sure, I just thought, you know, hey, you know, maybe we can...
[02:23:24.443 --> 02:23:27.824]  It'd be sort of like burning our draft card, you know, if we get thousands and thousands of people to do it.
[02:23:28.224 --> 02:23:28.444]  Sure.
[02:23:28.504 --> 02:23:29.025]  Anything else?
[02:23:30.405 --> 02:23:30.945]  No, that's it.
[02:23:30.985 --> 02:23:34.467]  Just bless you and your path, and God save our republic.
[02:23:35.627 --> 02:23:37.027]  Yeah, God protect the innocent.
[02:23:37.067 --> 02:23:40.429]  God protect the small people, the weak people.
[02:23:40.489 --> 02:23:41.749]  I mean, we're in for trouble, folks.
[02:23:41.789 --> 02:23:42.169]  We're in it.
[02:23:42.609 --> 02:23:43.910]  Omar in Detroit, Michigan.
[02:23:43.930 --> 02:23:44.550]  You're on the air.
[02:23:44.570 --> 02:23:45.610]  Yes, sir.
[02:23:47.011 --> 02:23:52.533]  I'm wondering what's going to happen when people find out Ron Paul is the other side of the hand.
[02:23:54.089 --> 02:23:59.996]  I've seen the Watcher Files website last night.
[02:24:00.277 --> 02:24:05.623]  They got a picture of Ron Paul throwing up that devil sign Bush and Clinton be throwing up.
[02:24:06.584 --> 02:24:08.827]  You know, I've seen that and I've seen the actual video.
[02:24:09.705 --> 02:24:10.646]  We're good to go.
[02:24:33.659 --> 02:24:44.145]  And so what happens is when your hand's been broken from playing baseball and sliding in and all the rest of that, is that if you watch, he's not sitting there touching his thumb to his fingers.
[02:24:44.485 --> 02:24:46.606]  His fingers are pulling down in the middle.
[02:24:47.087 --> 02:24:52.250]  And it just so happens that I've broken my hand more than ten times back when I used to be a ruffian.
[02:24:53.370 --> 02:24:59.894]  And instead of the middle ones, it's the side two, the pinky and the ring finger on mine pulled down.
[02:25:00.777 --> 02:25:07.083]  And are now shortening, and I can't imagine, I mean it hurts all the time, what it's going to be like when I am 73.
[02:25:07.123 --> 02:25:14.990]  Okay, well I just want to remind people not to have faith in any leader.
[02:25:15.990 --> 02:25:17.652]  Well, I mean we should... Go ahead.
[02:25:17.672 --> 02:25:19.273]  You lose your discernment.
[02:25:19.794 --> 02:25:21.135]  Well, I say this.
[02:25:21.755 --> 02:25:23.017]  Ron Paul's fruits are good.
[02:25:23.337 --> 02:25:25.519]  He wouldn't be putting out how the war is a fraud.
[02:25:26.593 --> 02:25:31.534]  How the Federal Reserve is evil, all the things he's doing, my discernment tells me he's good.
[02:25:31.614 --> 02:25:32.835]  Does he have some bad advisors?
[02:25:32.915 --> 02:25:33.215]  Maybe.
[02:25:33.235 --> 02:25:34.495]  Does he make mistakes?
[02:25:34.575 --> 02:25:35.055]  Certainly.
[02:25:35.075 --> 02:25:37.216]  Should we put all our eggs in one basket?
[02:25:37.456 --> 02:25:37.736]  No.
[02:25:37.816 --> 02:25:47.978]  Is the establishment attacking him, censoring him, blocking him, claiming he got second place, tied with McCain when he really got second and McCain got third?
[02:25:47.998 --> 02:25:50.999]  I mean, it just doesn't fit the M.O.
[02:25:51.019 --> 02:25:54.820]  with a lot of key points that would make me think he's a devil.
[02:25:55.747 --> 02:25:59.048]  There are a lot of sites, though, that take things out of context and do a lot of things.
[02:25:59.388 --> 02:26:01.829]  Rob Hall's just got a really messed up hand.
[02:26:02.529 --> 02:26:03.029]  Okay.
[02:26:03.730 --> 02:26:10.492]  And another thing is, with these Illuminatis, they all need to be tried and hung.
[02:26:11.192 --> 02:26:17.954]  I'm sitting here looking at a report that Bill Cooper put out, which I knew this anyway from Dr. John Coleman.
[02:26:18.694 --> 02:26:19.814]  AIDS is man-made.
[02:26:20.855 --> 02:26:22.235]  Absolutely.
[02:26:22.495 --> 02:26:25.156]  Hague, the big new Brzezinski
[02:26:26.286 --> 02:26:34.791]  Kissinger, some of the ringleaders in there, and all these people that's dying from AIDS, we want justice for them, because it's mostly African people.
[02:26:36.132 --> 02:26:39.955]  We want these people brought to justice, and we want them hung.
[02:26:40.275 --> 02:26:50.161]  Well, the scientific studies certainly show, and you're absolutely right about it being man-made, that it is much more easily contracted by Africans.
[02:26:51.087 --> 02:26:51.748]  No, that's it, Alex.
[02:26:51.768 --> 02:26:52.408]  Thanks a lot.
[02:27:22.131 --> 02:27:25.113]  It's so easy for these sides to sit there and scan every video he does.
[02:27:25.133 --> 02:27:31.277]  I mean, I have seen so many videos where my hand curls down like that.
[02:27:33.498 --> 02:27:35.499]  And, I mean, it's not on purpose.
[02:27:36.400 --> 02:27:37.400]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.801 --> 02:27:39.422]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.322 --> 02:27:43.024]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.531 --> 02:27:52.017]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:27:52.457 --> 02:27:56.681]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:27:57.122 --> 02:28:03.969]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:28:04.409 --> 02:28:11.116]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:11.436 --> 02:28:13.057]  There are no reported side effects.
[02:28:13.338 --> 02:28:16.521]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:28:16.801 --> 02:28:19.263]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[02:28:19.563 --> 02:28:26.310]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:28:26.730 --> 02:28:29.413]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.

[02:28:33.518 --> 02:28:35.280]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.
[02:28:46.651 --> 02:28:48.473]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:28:48.633 --> 02:28:55.340]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:28:55.600 --> 02:29:03.769]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:29:04.009 --> 02:29:09.735]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:29:09.875 --> 02:29:11.656]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:29:11.736 --> 02:29:13.876]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:29:13.896 --> 02:29:18.298]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:29:18.438 --> 02:29:20.558]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[02:29:20.658 --> 02:29:28.541]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[02:29:46.190 --> 02:29:51.832]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[02:29:52.032 --> 02:29:57.173]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[02:29:57.453 --> 02:30:02.535]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[02:30:02.835 --> 02:30:06.396]  People who alkalize to water they drink experience normalized blood sugar,
[02:30:06.696 --> 02:30:07.156]  We're good.
[02:30:33.670 --> 02:30:36.071]  Up to the pH of 10, with only 10 drops.

[02:30:47.696 --> 02:30:51.037]  Man thinks, cause he rules the earth.
[02:30:51.197 --> 02:30:54.818]  He can do with it as he pleases.
[02:30:55.199 --> 02:30:58.080]  And if things don't change soon,
[02:31:04.150 --> 02:31:05.231]  We're good to go.
[02:31:26.002 --> 02:31:44.086]  Now they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life and they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill and they bury him with stars
[02:31:45.043 --> 02:31:46.645]  We're good to go.
[02:32:03.365 --> 02:32:08.732]  Now he's helping for our destruction.
[02:32:08.912 --> 02:32:12.436]  He's afraid and confused, and he's breaking.
[02:32:12.456 --> 02:32:14.359]  This man is with great skill.
[02:32:19.355 --> 02:32:40.291]  Well, all he believes are his eyes And his eyes, they just haven't lied But there's a woman on my life Sitting there in a cold chill She said, who's gonna take away his license, kid?
[02:32:42.333 --> 02:32:48.958]  Baby, noise make her feel it Make her heart break her, back break her Leave no stone unturned
[02:32:49.910 --> 02:32:59.360]  Maybe an actor in a plush, that might be all that you've got, till you'll ever you clearly love.
[02:32:59.420 --> 02:33:09.730]  Now he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool, and when he sees his reflection,
[02:33:15.269 --> 02:33:15.989]  Bob Dylan.
[02:33:16.029 --> 02:33:16.570]  What a poet.
[02:33:16.630 --> 02:33:20.731]  Yeah, a lot of people work in the system.
[02:33:20.791 --> 02:33:25.913]  They enjoy the primitive exercise of power over the week.
[02:33:42.620 --> 02:33:46.342]  If they don't see that they're low down the pyramid, they're being amused and hurt as well.
[02:33:46.362 --> 02:33:49.203]  A science of hurting people.
[02:33:49.764 --> 02:33:50.284]  Of stealing.
[02:33:51.204 --> 02:33:52.585]  Without them ever even knowing who did it.
[02:33:53.465 --> 02:33:53.866]  Or why.
[02:33:53.886 --> 02:33:57.787]  Does it have to be this way?
[02:33:59.628 --> 02:34:03.150]  All the horrors we've seen will be nothing compared to what's coming.
[02:34:05.031 --> 02:34:06.292]  Do you really want to be part of this?
[02:34:06.312 --> 02:34:07.112]  Do you really want to be hurt?
[02:34:08.333 --> 02:34:11.054]  Do you really think you're going to escape what you're dealing out?
[02:34:13.379 --> 02:34:15.180]  We're good to go.
[02:34:15.200 --> 02:34:16.922]  We're good to go.
[02:34:40.299 --> 02:34:42.721]  Globally, stock markets are going down.
[02:34:42.821 --> 02:34:50.127]  Globally, other currencies are now falling, even as the dollar stagnates at 60% of its value from eight years ago.
[02:34:50.967 --> 02:34:51.888]  And we said that would happen.
[02:34:52.969 --> 02:34:55.230]  A lot of Europeans and others snickered at the weak dollar.
[02:34:56.111 --> 02:34:58.413]  Now it's stalling their production, stalling their growth.
[02:34:58.953 --> 02:34:59.334]  The U.S.
[02:34:59.394 --> 02:34:59.834]  is growing at 1.5%.
[02:35:03.280 --> 02:35:06.681]  They're now talking about depression on CNN and the McLaughlin Group.
[02:35:07.021 --> 02:35:19.084]  They go from overnight saying there's no recession to, oh yeah, we're in a really bad one, and it could become a depression, and it could be as bad as the depression, and we're in as big a crisis as we've been in since 1929.
[02:35:19.464 --> 02:35:23.385]  I could play the McLaughlin Group, but I don't think we have time.
[02:35:23.405 --> 02:35:24.625]  You know, C'est La Vie, let's play it.
[02:35:24.885 --> 02:35:26.906]  Do you have that McLaughlin clip?
[02:35:29.726 --> 02:35:30.606]  Remember I sent it to you?
[02:35:30.626 --> 02:35:31.087]  It's got the name.
[02:35:31.107 --> 02:35:32.807]  Do you have the Zuckerman clip?
[02:35:33.604 --> 02:35:37.887]  This is Zuckerman admitting, then they cut into a Ron Paul clip, then he comes back and says, Ron Paul's wrong.
[02:35:38.147 --> 02:35:39.268]  We used to agree with Ron Paul.
[02:35:39.709 --> 02:35:41.009]  Listen to this.
[02:35:41.630 --> 02:35:43.211]  Listen to what they're saying about the economy.
[02:35:43.471 --> 02:35:44.372]  This is McLaughlin Group.
[02:35:45.813 --> 02:35:47.094]  I don't think it's an exaggeration.
[02:35:47.114 --> 02:35:48.175]  I think it's an understatement.
[02:35:48.555 --> 02:35:53.639]  You've heard me say here, I think we are facing the worst financial crunch and crisis since the Great Depression.
[02:35:54.059 --> 02:36:02.385]  You have the entire banking system now that is virtually frozen, and there are not just the subprime mortgage thing, there are other things called credit default swaps,
[02:36:02.725 --> 02:36:03.085]  We're good to go.
[02:36:03.105 --> 02:36:03.646]  We're good to go.
[02:36:25.299 --> 02:36:26.820]  And it's going to go down even more next year.
[02:36:27.080 --> 02:36:30.924]  The credit crunch, you've just exploded the whole credit system in this country.
[02:36:30.964 --> 02:36:32.305]  We were way over-leveraged.
[02:36:32.585 --> 02:36:34.026]  The banking system was over-leveraged.
[02:36:34.267 --> 02:36:35.267]  People didn't even know about it.
[02:36:35.287 --> 02:36:36.488]  The bankers didn't know about it.
[02:36:36.749 --> 02:36:37.829]  They didn't assess the risk.
[02:36:38.110 --> 02:36:39.531]  Now that risk is piling in.
[02:36:39.691 --> 02:36:41.012]  Everybody's going to pay the price.
[02:36:41.993 --> 02:36:45.276]  Okay, now, he tells the truth about the death of the crisis, but then...
[02:36:47.822 --> 02:36:50.103]  He goes on to lie and say the bankers didn't know.
[02:36:50.123 --> 02:36:55.906]  Well, the real paper of record, the Financial Times of London, two years ago, a year ago, six months ago, put out multiple reports.
[02:36:55.926 --> 02:36:56.867]  I've probably seen ten.
[02:36:56.887 --> 02:37:01.389]  I've probably seen more than that, where they sometimes don't even cover them, where they admit.
[02:37:02.209 --> 02:37:08.012]  They say, oh yeah, the big central banks are engineering this and causing the credit crunch to precipitate a huge consolidation.
[02:37:08.052 --> 02:37:15.476]  In fact, about three years ago they said that, but the big question was, would this gyrate out of control and actually even hurt the big institutions?
[02:37:16.371 --> 02:37:19.654]  So in their greed, it may be so bad it even hurts them.
[02:37:20.134 --> 02:37:38.530]  I mean, $700 plus billion, last time I checked a month ago, has been dumped in the last four months into the markets, into the banks to try to sure them up, and they're just going to issue more currency and more credit to the central banks to try to sure up the mid-level banks that they're trying to consolidate.
[02:37:39.551 --> 02:37:41.933]  And so you hear about, oh, freezing interest rates,
[02:37:43.239 --> 02:37:54.903]  After they cut him, again, another 25 basis points, or 25% of a point, you hear him talk about, remember when Bush mailed out that $100 check to everybody?
[02:37:55.943 --> 02:37:56.403]  Remember that?
[02:37:56.543 --> 02:37:59.504]  My wife and I combined our incomes, we got a $200 check.
[02:37:59.524 --> 02:38:02.545]  Everybody was like, oh, it said, from your president, George Bush.
[02:38:02.565 --> 02:38:03.445]  I mean, what a gimmick.
[02:38:04.166 --> 02:38:06.066]  You and I rack, you know, mail people checks.
[02:38:06.566 --> 02:38:08.207]  Do that in Afghanistan, just hand out cash.
[02:38:08.849 --> 02:38:12.851]  Meanwhile, they devalued the money you had in the bank, and any of you that have got money, by 60%.
[02:38:15.111 --> 02:38:16.992]  And so they're doing nothing for the economy.
[02:38:17.432 --> 02:38:25.915]  They're only acting like they're doing something and trying to slow the slide as the IMF has said they wanted, as the Financial Times of London has said.
[02:38:26.276 --> 02:38:31.418]  They want an incremental unraveling, an incremental unfolding, so you don't freak out too bad.
[02:38:31.438 --> 02:38:34.279]  I mean, we'd say a year ago we were in a deep recession, which we were.
[02:38:34.379 --> 02:38:35.139]  The numbers have come out.
[02:38:36.354 --> 02:38:38.936]  People's income went down by $1,000 on average.
[02:38:39.616 --> 02:38:41.817]  And they called that a boom?
[02:38:42.458 --> 02:38:43.938]  A $1,000 loss in your income?
[02:38:45.279 --> 02:38:45.759]  On average?
[02:38:47.400 --> 02:38:48.401]  And that's with Cook numbers.
[02:38:48.441 --> 02:38:49.402]  It's even worse than that.
[02:38:54.545 --> 02:38:56.626]  And then we've got clips like this one.
[02:38:56.826 --> 02:38:58.607]  This is David Schuster on MSNBC.
[02:38:58.927 --> 02:39:01.308]  Ron Paul is the Al-Qaeda of the GOP.
[02:39:01.328 --> 02:39:02.209]  See that talking point?
[02:39:02.907 --> 02:39:05.828]  Fox, CNN, MSNBC, the talk radio.
[02:39:06.208 --> 02:39:10.368]  We're now a month plus into the new talking point, Al-Qaeda, Al-Qaeda, Al-Qaeda.
[02:39:10.788 --> 02:39:15.369]  Last week on Fox, they said the new Al-Qaeda is secret, blonde-haired, blue-eyed terrorists everywhere.
[02:39:15.449 --> 02:39:16.189]  No evidence, no proof.
[02:39:16.209 --> 02:39:17.130]  They just claim they're everywhere.
[02:39:17.690 --> 02:39:18.790]  Got to watch everybody now.
[02:39:19.830 --> 02:39:21.930]  After all, 10% of the college grads are going to be spying.
[02:39:21.950 --> 02:39:22.951]  There's got to be some Al-Qaeda.
[02:39:22.971 --> 02:39:24.771]  You know, they're going to stage a few terror events in the future.
[02:39:25.011 --> 02:39:25.871]  Just keep the fear going.
[02:39:26.731 --> 02:39:30.892]  And, again, the new talking point is Al-Qaeda is everywhere.
[02:39:31.761 --> 02:39:33.602]  And it's the evil Ron Paul supporters.
[02:39:33.622 --> 02:39:34.022]  Here it is.
[02:39:37.503 --> 02:39:39.303]  Oh, it's not up yet.
[02:39:39.323 --> 02:39:40.123]  I just found this.
[02:39:40.604 --> 02:39:41.204]  I didn't find it.
[02:39:41.244 --> 02:39:43.444]  I watched it this morning and then forgot to give it to John.
[02:39:43.464 --> 02:39:44.805]  He didn't have time to grab it.
[02:39:45.185 --> 02:39:45.885]  Okay, sorry.
[02:39:46.585 --> 02:39:48.026]  Let's jam in a few calls here.
[02:39:48.566 --> 02:39:49.186]  Miguel?
[02:39:49.206 --> 02:39:50.946]  Where are you calling this from, Miguel?
[02:39:51.447 --> 02:39:52.247]  Grand Rapids, Michigan.
[02:39:52.447 --> 02:39:52.767]  Welcome.
[02:39:53.127 --> 02:39:53.547]  How are you?
[02:39:53.767 --> 02:39:53.967]  Good.
[02:39:54.628 --> 02:39:56.048]  It's nice to talk to you, Mr. Jones.
[02:39:58.689 --> 02:39:59.709]  I drive semi-truck.
[02:40:00.530 --> 02:40:08.477]  And I just leased on with a new company, and when I went to go sign my paperwork, they gave me this highway watch program.
[02:40:08.497 --> 02:40:18.065]  Yeah, you gotta be a spy, and of course it says to fight crime and terror, people drinking, people walking down the highway, tell them about the spying.
[02:40:18.706 --> 02:40:26.933]  It says you will not get a badge and a gun, and you will not be given special treatment if you get pulled over for a violation, but you will get taken very seriously.
[02:40:27.603 --> 02:40:36.012]  If you should call in to report a suspicious incident or activity, we have first-hand knowledge that if you call something in, it will get checked out.
[02:40:36.793 --> 02:40:45.802]  And so you go sit through weeks of seminars at hotel ballrooms with goons and feds and cops, and then they're going to be looking for terror, and they're going to find it.
[02:40:45.902 --> 02:40:49.086]  It's, again, the total tattletale spy Stasi society.
[02:40:49.106 --> 02:40:49.947]  That's amazing.
[02:40:51.124 --> 02:40:55.948]  To have it happen to me and to have my company that I lease with now to encourage me to do it.
[02:40:55.988 --> 02:40:58.070]  It's voluntary and I'm not planning on doing it.
[02:40:58.130 --> 02:40:59.491]  Oh, it's going to become mandatory.
[02:40:59.751 --> 02:41:07.317]  I told the guys, if I see something wrong or somebody committing a crime or something, it's my obligation as an American citizen to call it in.
[02:41:07.337 --> 02:41:09.118]  I don't have to sign up for this program.
[02:41:09.138 --> 02:41:11.020]  But see, we've got video.
[02:41:11.220 --> 02:41:13.602]  Not just newscasts, we have video, hours of it.
[02:41:14.997 --> 02:41:16.438]  Of people that have videotaped these.
[02:41:16.518 --> 02:41:18.260]  And man, it's anti-gun.
[02:41:18.280 --> 02:41:21.303]  It's call if you see somebody with a gun in their gun rack.
[02:41:21.363 --> 02:41:22.664]  I mean, it's hell.
[02:41:22.684 --> 02:41:23.245]  It's amazing.
[02:41:23.665 --> 02:41:24.606]  Well, you ought to go take it.
[02:41:24.646 --> 02:41:25.867]  Just experience it for yourself.
[02:41:27.009 --> 02:41:32.594]  I also wanted to point out the fact that you were talking about the war and the industrial military complex.
[02:41:32.674 --> 02:41:37.459]  And I was wondering if you're familiar with Major General Smedley Butler.
[02:41:38.138 --> 02:41:39.238]  Yeah, war is a record.
[02:41:39.518 --> 02:41:41.359]  Two-time Congressional Medal of Honor winner.
[02:41:42.079 --> 02:41:43.119]  He's in my film.
[02:41:43.539 --> 02:41:44.820]  He overthrew a bunch of countries.
[02:41:44.860 --> 02:41:46.920]  He was kind of like the E. Howard Hunt before that.
[02:41:47.881 --> 02:41:49.141]  Because they had black ops then.
[02:41:49.161 --> 02:41:50.341]  It was called the Marine Corps.
[02:41:51.001 --> 02:41:52.522]  And they would go over through all these nations.
[02:41:52.542 --> 02:41:54.842]  And then he found out that they were financing the Nazis.
[02:41:55.322 --> 02:41:56.163]  They hired him.
[02:41:56.183 --> 02:41:59.743]  He went to meetings with all the big bankers, including the Bushes.
[02:42:00.224 --> 02:42:02.144]  And they said, we want you to have a fascist coup, 500,000 squad.
[02:42:02.164 --> 02:42:04.305]  We're going to take over.
[02:42:04.465 --> 02:42:05.585]  We're going to merge with Hitler.
[02:42:06.258 --> 02:42:09.800]  And he went to Congress and blew the whistle and they arrested some of them, but then it was kept real quiet.
[02:42:09.840 --> 02:42:10.741]  It's all in Endgame.
[02:42:11.501 --> 02:42:13.803]  And two-time Congressional Medal of Honor winner.
[02:42:14.723 --> 02:42:17.945]  He was in line to be the Marine Corps Commandant, but when he refused, he never got it.
[02:42:17.965 --> 02:42:18.806]  He was second in command.
[02:42:19.266 --> 02:42:19.686]  Brigadier General.
[02:42:19.706 --> 02:42:23.088]  I don't remember seeing that on Endgame, but I have watched all your videos.
[02:42:23.128 --> 02:42:24.729]  I had a friend of mine turn me on to you.
[02:42:25.429 --> 02:42:33.414]  And at first I was... I didn't believe much of it because I had got my news from the usual sources and I thought, well, you're just kind of kooky.
[02:42:33.454 --> 02:42:34.635]  And once I started...
[02:42:35.396 --> 02:42:41.700]  Reading and watching your movies, and I did independent research on the Internet, I started to realize that this is truly happening.
[02:42:42.480 --> 02:42:45.902]  And the more I study it, the more I've become awakened to it.
[02:42:45.922 --> 02:42:49.964]  And I tell my girlfriend about it, and now she understands, because she didn't believe either.
[02:42:50.165 --> 02:42:50.925]  Well, good job.
[02:42:50.965 --> 02:42:55.848]  What you can do when you finally wake up and get out of that matrix of propaganda.
[02:42:56.108 --> 02:42:56.408]  I hear you.
[02:42:56.428 --> 02:42:57.009]  I've got to jump.
[02:42:57.089 --> 02:42:57.609]  Thank you, sir.
[02:42:57.649 --> 02:42:58.389]  Call back again.
[02:42:58.409 --> 02:43:04.453]  Yeah, Endgame, the only problem with Endgame is it's two hours and 20 minutes, and I really should call it two films.
[02:43:05.754 --> 02:43:17.946]  Let's say it's the history of the New World Order, how they took over the Euro, how they're setting up the American Union, how they tried fascist dictatorships, the quick takeover before, but it didn't work, so they decided the slow socialist way was the way to do it.
[02:43:18.046 --> 02:43:20.448]  And yes, that is in the film, it's just so much you don't remember it.
[02:43:21.169 --> 02:43:22.730]  It's a film you should watch in two parts.
[02:43:23.211 --> 02:43:30.338]  Watch an hour and ten minutes, you know, 70 minutes, then watch it the next night or a week later, write notes on everything.
[02:43:30.965 --> 02:43:35.768]  We had a volunteer build a beautiful two-thirds bibliography at whatistheendgame.com.
[02:43:36.629 --> 02:43:40.711]  They haven't finished the last third on eugenics and transhumanism and the extermination plan.
[02:43:40.751 --> 02:43:42.332]  I know because that's so much research.
[02:43:43.053 --> 02:43:47.255]  But they built a beautiful second-by-second bibliography with the time code at whatistheendgame.com.
[02:43:47.415 --> 02:43:48.976]  I want to thank them for that.
[02:43:49.496 --> 02:43:53.499]  Also, endgamethemovie.com is also the same way to go to the site.
[02:43:53.839 --> 02:43:54.980]  But I hope they do that soon.
[02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:58.582]  I want to thank that volunteer because he did such a great job on the first two-thirds.
[02:43:58.602 --> 02:43:59.803]  We need that last third up there.
[02:44:01.517 --> 02:44:02.417]  But, yeah.
[02:44:03.578 --> 02:44:06.899]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ron in Arizona.
[02:44:06.999 --> 02:44:07.739]  Ron, you're on the air.
[02:44:08.500 --> 02:44:09.840]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:44:10.801 --> 02:44:29.968]  Is there any way that we can get someone for this Saturday in South Carolina, the Democratic primary, and all future primaries, to go to a local TV station, try to get a TV journalist to go out to a polling station about an hour beforehand, and request
[02:44:30.819 --> 02:44:39.661]  The Diebold operators of the Diebold machines to run a test run through about 20 ballots
[02:44:40.245 --> 02:44:41.886]  Reach of a top candidate.
[02:44:42.046 --> 02:44:47.250]  They have rules because, again, it's a private company where you're not allowed to do tests or document.
[02:44:47.591 --> 02:44:48.852]  They've had fraud everywhere.
[02:44:48.932 --> 02:44:52.214]  Even bigger crises in South Carolina for the Republicans.
[02:44:52.615 --> 02:44:55.157]  Even bigger crises in other states and the media.
[02:44:55.637 --> 02:44:57.759]  It's in local blurbs, but you never hear about it again.
[02:44:57.779 --> 02:45:02.062]  I mean, Ron Paul got second place and they gave it to McCain in front of everyone.
[02:45:02.622 --> 02:45:04.704]  But if we could just get a lot of
[02:45:05.188 --> 02:45:08.870]  Volunteers to go to local stations and tell them what's happening.
[02:45:08.890 --> 02:45:10.872]  Well, that's been going on.
[02:45:11.152 --> 02:45:13.293]  Those local stations are owned by the local jefes.
[02:45:14.674 --> 02:45:24.380]  Yeah, because what I know DieVote is doing is they're throwing every tenth count, every tenth vote for Obama and every tenth vote for Edwards.
[02:45:24.400 --> 02:45:25.381]  They're giving it to Hillary.
[02:45:25.761 --> 02:45:30.144]  And then they're pre-loading several hundred votes in each precinct for Hillary.
[02:45:30.606 --> 02:45:42.812]  And they're going to just give us South Carolina the way they did New Hampshire, and they'll come up with some kind of spin saying, well, the blacks don't think Obama can win the national election, so they all voted for Hillary.
[02:45:43.332 --> 02:45:44.213]  I appreciate your call.
[02:45:44.313 --> 02:45:47.554]  I mean, we say there's fraud in New Mexico, it comes out there was.
[02:45:47.594 --> 02:45:50.596]  We say there's fraud in Ohio, it comes out there was, people go to prison.
[02:45:52.006 --> 02:45:54.308]  Look, people say, well, then why are you supporting Ron Paul?
[02:45:54.348 --> 02:45:55.109]  He's educating.
[02:45:55.149 --> 02:45:57.590]  He's injecting issues into the process.
[02:45:57.630 --> 02:45:59.392]  People are finding out about more of the fraud.
[02:45:59.952 --> 02:46:01.053]  We have to engage them.
[02:46:01.073 --> 02:46:02.214]  We have to keep fighting them.
[02:46:03.235 --> 02:46:06.077]  The same tactics of the Founding Fathers, losing battle after battle.
[02:46:06.537 --> 02:46:11.741]  You have to keep stepping up and keep walking into the machine gun fire.
[02:46:12.602 --> 02:46:14.323]  We will beat them in the human way of attack.
[02:46:14.343 --> 02:46:17.306]  You just keep engaging them, keep having faith, realizing everything.
[02:46:17.326 --> 02:46:18.747]  Taking action is victory.
[02:46:19.728 --> 02:46:19.848]  Okay?
[02:46:19.868 --> 02:46:20.008]  Okay?
[02:46:21.414 --> 02:46:23.795]  And, you know, it's that simple.
[02:46:25.196 --> 02:46:26.797]  Nancy in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:46:26.837 --> 02:46:27.237]  Go ahead.
[02:46:27.918 --> 02:46:28.438]  Hi, Alex.
[02:46:28.478 --> 02:46:33.521]  I'm calling from East Texas, and I want to let your listeners know, especially the one that called earlier, what he can do.
[02:46:34.021 --> 02:46:39.864]  He can come to Tyler, Texas this weekend and hear Larry Pratt speak Friday night and Saturday.
[02:46:40.224 --> 02:46:44.667]  We're having a constitutional conference, and we are showcasing Larry Pratt
[02:46:45.604 --> 02:46:49.005]  Alan Stang, Michael Bednarik, Judith McGarry.
[02:46:49.045 --> 02:46:58.829]  They're going to be talking about pertinent issues that can change people's lives if they get involved with their freedom and their liberty and that's going to be in Tyler, Texas this Friday and Saturday.
[02:46:58.869 --> 02:47:02.730]  And then Saturday night we're having a fundraiser for Ron Paul.
[02:47:03.476 --> 02:47:07.419]  And we would like to have all of these Texas of your listeners, all of Texas, get on an airplane.
[02:47:07.439 --> 02:47:09.080]  We put it in Tyler so they could go to the airport.
[02:47:09.120 --> 02:47:09.360]  Absolutely.
[02:47:09.580 --> 02:47:10.500]  Nancy, we've got to jump.
[02:47:10.520 --> 02:47:13.282]  You can find out more about that at gunowners.org.
[02:47:13.322 --> 02:47:15.604]  We had Larry on a few weeks ago, and he plugged that.
[02:47:16.364 --> 02:47:20.807]  And go bring your NRA friends and let them find out that the NRA is actually a gun control group.
[02:47:22.308 --> 02:47:23.368]  You know, expose that.
[02:47:23.528 --> 02:47:26.210]  Expose how they give illegal aliens special treatment.
[02:47:26.270 --> 02:47:32.174]  Expose how the fluoride is deadly poison, mainstream news, rotting holes in your brain and brain damaging you, lowering your IQ.
[02:47:33.415 --> 02:47:36.177]  Expose how the NRA is really a gun control group.
[02:47:36.958 --> 02:47:39.979]  I mean, look, they can't stand exposure.
[02:47:40.840 --> 02:47:41.721]  They can't deal with it.
[02:47:42.321 --> 02:47:48.725]  You know what, John, during the break, cue it up to just the part where on MSNBC they say Ron Paul, quote, is the Republican Al-Qaeda.
[02:47:48.745 --> 02:47:50.766]  Because I just want to come back and play that.
[02:47:50.806 --> 02:47:52.487]  We can't play the whole clip where it gets even worse.
[02:47:52.507 --> 02:47:54.729]  Let's just play that one little clip when we get back.
[02:47:55.695 --> 02:47:58.177]  And then I'm going to take a few more calls and wrap up this transmission.
[02:47:58.197 --> 02:48:00.098]  There's a lot of news I didn't get to, but we covered most of it.
[02:48:00.459 --> 02:48:03.581]  So Cash22, either cover all the news or take your calls.
[02:48:04.602 --> 02:48:06.063]  And we do the best we can here.
[02:48:08.105 --> 02:48:09.005]  I'm just exhausted.
[02:48:09.105 --> 02:48:10.406]  Oh, I said I'd talk about Dallas.
[02:48:10.647 --> 02:48:17.772]  Should I suspend calls and give you three minutes on that and two minutes on the clip about what happened with the JFK situation up in Dallas?
[02:48:19.914 --> 02:48:21.355]  See, I'm going to make those decisions.
[02:48:22.349 --> 02:48:23.670]  I don't like cutting your calls off.
[02:48:23.690 --> 02:48:24.731]  I don't like not playing the clips.
[02:48:24.751 --> 02:48:31.597]  I don't like not covering the news or giving you analysis and debriefing to the audience about what happened up there.
[02:48:31.617 --> 02:48:34.099]  I'm fighting as hard as I can.
[02:48:34.119 --> 02:48:35.820]  I'm hitting every angle I can.
[02:48:35.860 --> 02:48:36.661]  I'm taking action.
[02:48:37.041 --> 02:48:38.642]  I'm hitting the barbed wire, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:39.103 --> 02:48:40.104]  This is the tip of the spear.
[02:48:40.164 --> 02:48:41.705]  This is the info war.
[02:48:42.425 --> 02:48:44.607]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:44.647 --> 02:48:45.488]  A new world order.
[02:48:51.039 --> 02:48:55.221]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:48:55.921 --> 02:48:57.682]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:48:58.743 --> 02:49:00.984]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:49:01.524 --> 02:49:03.965]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:49:04.705 --> 02:49:12.049]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:15.063 --> 02:49:20.046]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:20.527 --> 02:49:23.989]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:24.369 --> 02:49:28.252]  They're not after money.
[02:49:28.352 --> 02:49:29.953]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:30.173 --> 02:49:30.934]  They're after power.
[02:49:31.154 --> 02:49:32.175]  That's what they have to do.
[02:49:32.295 --> 02:49:40.520]  Order Endgame on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.

[02:49:43.842 --> 02:49:44.863]  You have been warned.
[02:49:45.863 --> 02:49:48.805]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:49:48.965 --> 02:49:54.107]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:49:54.487 --> 02:49:59.769]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:50:00.210 --> 02:50:01.330]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:50:01.690 --> 02:50:10.534]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[02:50:10.994 --> 02:50:12.596]  Now compare a Calbin Pure Soap.

[02:50:53.599 --> 02:50:55.681]  The warm, soothing bubbles rushing around your feet.
[02:50:55.841 --> 02:50:56.963]  The joy of relaxation.
[02:50:57.123 --> 02:51:02.028]  Few people realize how much benefit the ionic cleansing can be to remove toxins from your body.
[02:51:02.108 --> 02:51:05.952]  Electricity Premier Foot Spa helps in cleansing the body of harmful toxins.
[02:51:06.272 --> 02:51:06.833]  Thank you.
[02:51:06.893 --> 02:51:07.233]  Thank you.
[02:51:26.636 --> 02:51:27.637]  I think it's a great analogy.
[02:51:27.717 --> 02:51:30.179]  I mean, Ron Paul, the Al-Qaeda wing, the Republican Party.
[02:51:30.199 --> 02:51:30.880]  I think it's terrific.
[02:51:30.920 --> 02:51:31.000]  What?
[02:51:54.597 --> 02:52:04.083]  You have just raised the level of discourse by comparing Ron Paul, the Libertarian, to Al Qaeda.
[02:52:04.103 --> 02:52:13.849]  Would you like to apologize now, or have Jerry Daines drop your statement?
[02:52:14.770 --> 02:52:18.132]  There's the sitcom Pentagon CIA talking point.
[02:52:18.152 --> 02:52:20.634]  You realize what enemies of America you are?
[02:52:21.634 --> 02:52:22.735]  What traitors you are.
[02:52:23.661 --> 02:52:24.702]  How dare you!
[02:52:26.004 --> 02:52:30.149]  Swear that oath when you join their services and claim you were for this country.
[02:52:30.650 --> 02:52:33.673]  You're for the New World Order sucking this nation dry.
[02:52:35.235 --> 02:52:38.159]  You're enemies of the Republic.
[02:52:39.019 --> 02:52:39.599]  We're good to go.
[02:52:56.892 --> 02:52:57.992]  I got some final news.
[02:52:59.033 --> 02:53:00.774]  Final stuff I want to talk about what happened in Dallas.
[02:53:00.894 --> 02:53:05.856]  But Coco Mojo, the healthy immune-assisting, boosting hot chocolate.
[02:53:06.176 --> 02:53:09.937]  They've got healthy coffees infused with key nutrients with their mainline thing.
[02:53:10.377 --> 02:53:14.419]  Their top product is the 20 superfoods in the inner food, green food.
[02:53:16.368 --> 02:53:20.291]  Just a few scoops every day and you get more nutrients than with all the other food you eat combined.
[02:53:20.411 --> 02:53:21.332]  It is superfood.

[02:53:43.869 --> 02:53:46.551]  Great folks at Interfood Botanical Company.

[02:53:57.796 --> 02:54:00.758]  My latest film, Endgame, in absolute super high quality.
[02:54:01.158 --> 02:54:01.698]  That's right, A.D.
[02:54:01.718 --> 02:54:02.059]  253-3139 or again,
[02:54:29.116 --> 02:54:31.157]  Five months free at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:54:31.617 --> 02:54:34.019]  I can't do justice to this, so I'm going to get into it more tomorrow.
[02:54:34.499 --> 02:54:34.959]  You know, St.
[02:54:34.979 --> 02:54:52.368]  John Hunt's father, the legendary former head of Western Hemisphere of CIA, everything from the Bay of Pigs, the overthrow of Guatemala, he was involved in hundreds of major operations, and of course we always knew the assassination of JFK, E. Howard Hunt.
[02:54:52.388 --> 02:54:58.071]  I wonder if Dallas met with him, got videotapes of his father saying the same thing he says on audio that nobody's ever seen.
[02:54:58.812 --> 02:54:59.533]  We're good to go.
[02:55:20.956 --> 02:55:23.918]  God, the stuff I learned was much worse than what even in the interviews he said here.
[02:55:23.938 --> 02:55:27.260]  He's going to be back on with us Friday for about an hour and a half.
[02:55:27.320 --> 02:55:27.501]  St.
[02:55:27.541 --> 02:55:29.922]  John Hunt, Jim Mars up there consulting with me.
[02:55:29.942 --> 02:55:30.803]  I'm going to interview some others.
[02:55:31.243 --> 02:55:33.645]  I'm going to make the ultimate JFK film.
[02:55:34.245 --> 02:55:37.327]  Also the ultimate 9-11 truth slash activism film.
[02:55:37.608 --> 02:55:39.269]  We're making two films in tandem.
[02:55:39.789 --> 02:55:45.073]  Not just kicking it up a notch every time in production quality and the info, but doubling, double barrel blast.
[02:55:46.221 --> 02:55:47.442]  The enemy knows the time is short.
[02:55:47.462 --> 02:55:48.242]  They're moving against us.
[02:55:48.302 --> 02:55:49.263]  We know the time is short.
[02:55:49.803 --> 02:55:50.423]  Redoubling.
[02:55:50.463 --> 02:55:51.304]  Then redouble again.
[02:55:51.324 --> 02:55:52.004]  Then redouble.
[02:55:52.224 --> 02:55:53.185]  Then redouble that.
[02:55:53.465 --> 02:55:55.046]  Turbo the info war.
[02:55:55.386 --> 02:55:57.547]  Go to the next level, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:57.567 --> 02:55:59.548]  So I'll give you a report tomorrow.
[02:55:59.568 --> 02:56:00.248]  I'll have it in Dallas.
[02:56:00.288 --> 02:56:01.689]  I promise I'll put at least 20 minutes on it.
[02:56:01.709 --> 02:56:03.130]  A lot of big revelations.
[02:56:04.247 --> 02:56:06.989]  Ladies and gentlemen, retransmission launches.
[02:56:07.689 --> 02:56:16.414]  Another volley, another broadside attack on the enemy compounds and enemy propaganda factory starts in 70 seconds.
[02:56:16.514 --> 02:56:20.496]  T minus 70 seconds at termination of broadcast.
