[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.931]  Let me read you something off the Harvard University website, the Gazette News, from
[00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:42.041]  Now, this is basically two and a half weeks after 9-11 because you did just mention people like, you know, Martin Luther King Jr., a great man, but then you mentioned people like Al Sharpton and, you know, other people who were under suspicion.
[00:00:43.222 --> 00:00:44.723]  And, uh, of just being corrupt.
[00:00:44.763 --> 00:00:48.767]  I mean, not necessarily being part of any globalist organization, but very corruptible.
[00:00:49.557 --> 00:00:54.702]  Alright, this is what Jesse Jackson had to say in front of Harvard University two and a half weeks after 9-11.
[00:00:55.243 --> 00:00:57.204]  It is easy to handle triumph.
[00:00:57.845 --> 00:01:00.628]  Can we handle trouble or disaster, said Jackson.
[00:01:01.168 --> 00:01:06.494]  Let us rise together for hope, healing, and a vision for the new world order.
[00:01:06.634 --> 00:01:07.915]  And he uses this term all the time.
[00:01:07.955 --> 00:01:08.736]  He's not the only guy.
[00:01:09.336 --> 00:01:12.138]  So, I just wanted to bring that up to Jamil, look into it.
[00:01:12.178 --> 00:01:16.760]  Like I said, I'm voting for an African American candidate for president on November 4th.
[00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.701]  One week from today, I will be voting for Cynthia McKinney.
[00:01:21.354 --> 00:01:23.315]  The Green Party candidate for president.
[00:01:23.575 --> 00:01:26.897]  I encourage people not to waste their vote and vote third party.
[00:01:27.097 --> 00:01:28.358]  I disagree with Tarpley.
[00:01:29.158 --> 00:01:36.922]  I don't think getting McCain into office is probable or possible unless, you know, the elitists really want that and they rig the voting machines to do so.
[00:01:37.522 --> 00:01:42.945]  All right, without further ado, we're going to bring on Ray McGovern, the 26-year CIA analyst.
[00:01:43.906 --> 00:01:45.807]  He debriefed people like Dick Cheney and others.
[00:01:46.267 --> 00:01:47.528]  In the eighties, his latest
[00:01:49.033 --> 00:01:51.377]  You're welcome Jason, glad to be with you.
[00:02:05.905 --> 00:02:21.357]  Now, Ray, before we get into this editorial, election day is a week away, I interviewed you a little over two years ago, right in the run up to the 2006 election, and we talked about the Democratic Congress getting in and possibly emboldening them.
[00:02:21.757 --> 00:02:23.639]  Two years later, we're not out of Iraq.
[00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:26.281]  I mean, obviously there are Democrats that I want to see in.
[00:02:26.301 --> 00:02:28.703]  I'd love to see Cindy Sheehan take Pelosi's seat.
[00:02:28.763 --> 00:02:30.604]  Oh, man, that would be a huge triumph.
[00:02:31.225 --> 00:02:33.807]  But give me your take on the election right now.
[00:02:35.928 --> 00:02:51.935]  Well, if I take five steps back, Jason, I say to myself, wow, I thought it was going to be a choice between a McCain type person and Mrs. Clinton.
[00:02:53.516 --> 00:02:55.837]  That would have been a real, real problem for me.
[00:02:56.758 --> 00:03:03.841]  I never thought that I would have a candidate running who has said sensible things about Iraq.
[00:03:04.875 --> 00:03:24.728]  I had said less than sensible things about other things, but certainly, in my view, you have to look at what the alternative is, and I noted your advice to people in your own decision to support my good friend, Cynthia.
[00:03:25.488 --> 00:03:31.672]  However, I would ask people to reflect on what that could mean, because that happened once before.
[00:03:31.732 --> 00:03:33.353]  Lots of people supported it.
[00:03:34.521 --> 00:03:46.570]  And you're obviously talking about Ralph Nader who has run in the previous two elections and also in this one, correct?
[00:03:55.751 --> 00:03:57.372]  And I just still can't get over it.
[00:04:26.811 --> 00:04:37.956]  Yeah, Jason, again, I know Webster, I think what one has to do is be really careful about taking campaign rhetoric as a sign of real intention.
[00:04:38.876 --> 00:04:42.838]  I mean, look at what Obama has said about Israel, for example.
[00:04:42.858 --> 00:04:53.202]  I mean, it's almost sickening how the candidates reply among themselves to tell the American public who loves Israel the best, Joe Biden.
[00:04:53.646 --> 00:04:59.951]  Trying to outdo everyone else by saying, yeah, we all love Israel, but I love Israel with a passion, you know?
[00:05:00.452 --> 00:05:01.713]  I mean, that's really ridiculous.
[00:05:01.913 --> 00:05:05.256]  So you expect that kind of rhetoric from Obama, from anybody.
[00:05:05.756 --> 00:05:16.706]  And when he talks about, you know, about Afghanistan, for example, he has to sort of show the American people how tough he is, that he is up to the task, a military task.
[00:05:22.028 --> 00:05:48.079]  But I would fully expect, and I've been wrong about these kinds of things before, but I would fully expect that once were he to be in office, that the people that he would gather around him would tell him what a feckless exercise not only Iraq but Afghanistan has been, and that the history dictates that no one wins this kind of battle or occupation, and he would come to his senses.
[00:05:48.792 --> 00:05:55.773]  I'm not willing to address what Obama says about these things as though they should be taken at face value.
[00:05:56.753 --> 00:06:09.036]  So you do think that he's somewhat genuine and there's a possibility that these aggressions in the Middle East will subside after he's elected and he puts in an administration that you feel would de-escalate the war?
[00:06:10.556 --> 00:06:16.817]  Well, yeah, I have, you know, the notion of the candidate who says, you know, a hundred years, no problem.
[00:06:18.072 --> 00:06:21.493]  Coming into office turns my hair on end.
[00:06:22.733 --> 00:06:37.136]  I don't think that a fellow who's made his reputation by crashing airplanes and getting shot down has shown any real acuity with respect to policies to be crafted or followed.
[00:06:37.796 --> 00:06:40.317]  And so it's a matter of compared to what, finally.
[00:06:40.997 --> 00:06:44.658]  And, you know, when I look at the Democratic candidate,
[00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:54.831]  When you look at the debates, there's a fellow with a cool head, easy and eager to learn, and I think he's teachable.
[00:06:54.851 --> 00:07:11.795]  I think he will probably avoid the mistakes of predecessors who thought they could come into Washington and diss the people in the press and others with whom you really have to work out a compromise so that they will give you half a chance to have your message heard.
[00:07:14.255 --> 00:07:17.017]  It's going to be not a very hard act to follow.
[00:07:18.078 --> 00:07:21.241]  I mean, these eight years have been a disaster for our country.
[00:07:21.902 --> 00:07:39.337]  And just as my friend Bobby Gates, the Secretary of Defense, just as he followed Rumsfeld and had like a two-year honeymoon, so too, I think, whoever replaces Bush, presumably if it's the favorite contender,
[00:07:39.963 --> 00:07:48.436]  That he will have a honeymoon period where people will just so delighted to listen to a person who just conceivably might tell the truth on occasion.
[00:07:49.397 --> 00:07:54.645]  That if he's of a mind to, and hopefully is, he can change these crazy policies.
[00:07:55.956 --> 00:07:58.618]  Well, I don't share your optimism.
[00:07:58.698 --> 00:08:01.400]  I feel like he is the slicker candidate by far.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.302]  He's obviously more well-spoken.
[00:08:03.322 --> 00:08:12.149]  When John McCain comes out and talks about a hundred-year war, or he talks about us being the enemy, I mean, I think you can kind of see the senility in his face.
[00:08:12.169 --> 00:08:13.370]  He doesn't look the healthiest.
[00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.472]  I can't even believe that they've put him up there.
[00:08:16.532 --> 00:08:20.195]  Honestly, in the run-up to this, I thought they would go with someone more like a Romney.
[00:08:21.656 --> 00:08:23.097]  I mean, McCain's establishment.
[00:08:24.418 --> 00:08:26.679]  The Palin pick, I mean, it's bizarre.
[00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:28.739]  It's not like he has a strong ticket.
[00:08:28.779 --> 00:08:30.380]  It's almost like they're throwing the election.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.241]  I mean, do you really think that McCain has a shot at winning this?
[00:08:37.022 --> 00:08:41.443]  You know, this is not my field of expertise, Jason.
[00:08:41.623 --> 00:08:46.165]  My opinion in this area is not worth anything more than the next person's.
[00:08:46.305 --> 00:08:53.927]  But, you know, there are so many variables and so many shenanigans that have been played over the last couple of elections.
[00:08:54.805 --> 00:09:04.511]  That I would encourage anyone who is as afraid as I am of Palin and McCain to make sure that not only that their vote is taken, but that their vote is counted.
[00:09:04.531 --> 00:09:07.533]  Alright, well let's jump to this Iran situation.
[00:09:07.573 --> 00:09:15.558]  You wrote this editorial, you know, we've discussed Iran at length on the radio and TV interviews with you, Infowars, and myself.
[00:09:16.018 --> 00:09:19.040]  Do you really think right now we are off the table with Iran?
[00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.022]  It looks like there will not be a war of aggression out there?
[00:09:23.773 --> 00:09:24.814]  Yes they do, Jason.
[00:09:26.115 --> 00:09:42.627]  And I say that as one who for three years was saying that chances were at least equal and probably greater than equal that Bush and Cheney to fulfill their promise to Israel would, quote, take care of Iran.
[00:09:43.288 --> 00:09:44.029]  What's changed?
[00:09:44.349 --> 00:09:45.990]  Well, there are a bunch of things that have changed.
[00:09:47.071 --> 00:09:51.094]  One is that the senior uniformed military in this country
[00:09:51.781 --> 00:09:53.462]  Have shown a little guts for a change.
[00:09:54.243 --> 00:09:59.887]  We had Admiral Fallon resigning after saying, we're not going to do Iran on my watch.
[00:10:00.888 --> 00:10:13.958]  Resigning rather than letting himself be on the receiving end of the idiotic order to start a war with Iran and risk the fortunes and lives of all those troops he has in Iraq, Afghanistan, and in the Gulf.
[00:10:13.978 --> 00:10:19.743]  He didn't want to put himself in that position and so he in effect quit by going to the press and saying,
[00:10:20.191 --> 00:10:22.093]  We're not going to do Iran, that would be crazy.
[00:10:22.793 --> 00:10:32.522]  Now, Admiral Mullen, Mike Mullen, who came in, I was an army officer, so it's really hard for me to say these good things about Navy admirals.
[00:10:33.202 --> 00:10:38.947]  But Admiral Mullen, man, I think he's got guts that we haven't seen.
[00:10:38.967 --> 00:10:47.755]  He goes back from Israel and says it would be very foolish to open yet a third war, a third front in that part of the area.
[00:10:48.513 --> 00:10:52.534]  And then we later learned that we learned this from the Israeli press.
[00:10:52.594 --> 00:10:58.877]  I mean, you don't learn anything like this from the American press, what I call the fawning corporate media.
[00:10:59.477 --> 00:11:17.523]  We learned from the Israeli press that when Mullen was there, he braced his opposite numbers in the Israeli leadership and he said, look, don't even think, don't even think of any tricks in the Persian Gulf or anything that would provoke the Iranians so that they would attack you.
[00:11:18.297 --> 00:11:19.719]  You would expect us to come in.
[00:11:19.779 --> 00:11:22.002]  We're not going to come in if you provoke the attack.
[00:11:22.562 --> 00:11:24.925]  And then, you know, the real blitz, Jason.
[00:11:24.965 --> 00:11:26.187]  You know what he brought up?
[00:11:26.367 --> 00:11:28.970]  Well, we'll bring it up on the other side because we're just about to go to break.
[00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:30.912]  We're with Ray McGovern, former CIA analyst.
[00:11:31.193 --> 00:11:33.135]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:11:33.355 --> 00:11:35.618]  This is the Alex Jones Show, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:11:46.061 --> 00:11:46.482]  Gold.
[00:11:46.842 --> 00:11:48.123]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:11:48.384 --> 00:11:54.471]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:11:54.651 --> 00:11:58.495]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:11:58.835 --> 00:12:00.718]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:12:00.778 --> 00:12:00.958]  Mint,
[00:12:01.298 --> 00:12:03.039]  Demand is at an all-time high.
[00:12:03.179 --> 00:12:10.922]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.

[00:12:28.168 --> 00:12:28.588]  I think so.
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:47.440]  Attention please!
[00:12:47.601 --> 00:12:50.023]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:12:50.043 --> 00:12:52.665]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:12:52.685 --> 00:12:53.825]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:12:53.845 --> 00:12:55.467]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:12:55.547 --> 00:12:58.389]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:12:58.449 --> 00:13:02.072]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:16.613]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:13:17.873 --> 00:13:19.034]  An inside job?
[00:13:20.375 --> 00:13:21.455]  How dare you?
[00:13:21.656 --> 00:13:27.879]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:13:27.899 --> 00:13:30.600]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.282]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years,
[00:13:36.265 --> 00:13:37.206]  Truth Rising.

[00:13:42.368 --> 00:13:44.890]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:49.952]  Don't be a victim of sudden cardiac arrest due to inflammation of the arterial walls.

[00:14:20.555 --> 00:14:27.818]  Hempusa.org believes that now is the time to plan for the future and food will be your greatest asset.
[00:14:28.438 --> 00:14:30.679]  People spend money on all kinds of things.
[00:14:31.189 --> 00:14:35.252]  But our warning is prepare now for food shortages in the future.
[00:14:36.053 --> 00:14:37.074]  So don't delay.

[00:14:45.313 --> 00:15:00.526]  You know, as a father and a husband, one of the enjoyable things in my life has been walking in at night and checking on my children, checking up on my wife, making sure she has the things she needs, but mostly providing for my family and knowing that they're secure, that they feel comfortable every day in their little skins.
[00:15:00.646 --> 00:15:04.929]  They don't have to worry about the oddities of the world taking over and wrecking their lives.
[00:15:05.089 --> 00:15:13.296]  I've always wanted to be a good provider, and I'm not going to change that now just because the economy's in upheaval and because there's a lot of political and social uncertainty.
[00:15:13.616 --> 00:15:14.377]  We're good to go.
[00:15:32.312 --> 00:15:34.915]  I do hope that you'll join me in this new sense of American security.

[00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:39.059]  Call them today.
[00:15:39.099 --> 00:15:39.720]  You'll be glad you did.
[00:15:54.853 --> 00:15:55.994]  All right, folks, we are back.
[00:15:56.054 --> 00:15:56.955]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:15:57.015 --> 00:15:58.236]  I'm Jason Bermas, subbing in.
[00:15:58.716 --> 00:15:59.397]  I'm a filmmaker.
[00:15:59.457 --> 00:16:03.140]  I've made Fabled Enemies, Loose Change 2nd Edition, Loose Change Final Cut.
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:10.246]  I'm currently working on Invisible Empire, and I hope that you go to InfoWars.com right now and order copies, make copies, hand them out.
[00:16:10.647 --> 00:16:11.748]  This is vital information.
[00:16:11.768 --> 00:16:15.931]  We're with Ray McGovern, 26-year CIA veteran, and he's discussing with us the
[00:16:17.012 --> 00:16:25.016]  Military personnel who have returned home and said, no war with Iran, and you were just discussing a gentleman who just returned from Israel and said the same thing, right?
[00:16:26.316 --> 00:16:44.765]  Yes, this was the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Jason Mike Mullen, an Admiral, who was out there in June, actually, and told the Israelis, not only do we not want a new war with Iran, but don't even think about trying to provoke one by doing something to let the
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:47.900]  Let the boom go up.
[00:16:48.601 --> 00:16:54.662]  Now, what I was trying to say is he did something incredibly gutsy, something that no U.S.
[00:16:54.802 --> 00:17:01.543]  statesman has done in 41 years, and that is he raised the incident of the U.S.
[00:17:01.603 --> 00:17:08.365]  Liberty ship that was deliberately attacked by Israel on the 8th of June, 1967, with 34 crewmen killed, 174 wounded,
[00:17:14.465 --> 00:17:20.029]  It was an incredible attack, and we have bulletproof evidence that it was intentional.
[00:17:20.289 --> 00:17:23.712]  Exactly why the Israelis did it is a matter of speculation.
[00:17:23.732 --> 00:17:25.393]  You're talking about the USS Liberty, of course.
[00:17:26.213 --> 00:17:26.514]  Yes.
[00:17:27.274 --> 00:17:35.420]  And what Colin said was, you know, he said, look, he said, we don't want any more USS Liberty-type incidents.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:36.420]  Ooh!
[00:17:37.221 --> 00:17:38.722]  Now, why was it so powerful?
[00:17:38.782 --> 00:17:39.863]  Because the Israelis know.
[00:17:40.655 --> 00:17:49.817]  Ben Mullen knows, as a naval officer, what happened back on that terrible day, June 8th, 1967, and that Mullen was not going to let it happen again.
[00:17:50.297 --> 00:17:56.379]  That's about as direct, that's about as clear a message as you can send to the Israeli leaders.
[00:17:56.879 --> 00:18:10.182]  And right after that, right after that, we saw a slight attenuation of the propaganda out of Israel and out of the United States with respect to what a terrible threat Iran is or was, but really isn't.
[00:18:10.956 --> 00:18:20.241]  Now, the next big factor that has made it unlikely that we will be striking Iran by air is Russia, the Russian bear.
[00:18:20.981 --> 00:18:28.425]  We talk about the bear market, well, I'm talking about the Russian bear who has it up to here now with his nose being tweaked.
[00:18:29.045 --> 00:18:37.329]  What happened was the Russians saw Israel and saw us, that is Cheney and Elliot Abrams and those types in the White House,
[00:18:37.998 --> 00:18:42.981]  As being behind that idiot Saakashvili's attack on South Ossetia.
[00:18:43.781 --> 00:18:44.942]  Now, why was that important?
[00:18:45.002 --> 00:18:59.850]  Well, the Russians are up to here and they said, look, you know, not only are we going to repel this attack, and they did so brutally out of all the debris for that, not only are we going to repel the attack, but don't even think about Georgia becoming part of NATO or the Ukraine.
[00:19:00.331 --> 00:19:06.074]  And besides Israelis, if you thought that you could use Georgian air fuels to attack Iran,
[00:19:06.909 --> 00:19:08.389]  Look at the map, you folks.
[00:19:09.009 --> 00:19:21.231]  If it were the only feasible way without flying over Iraq and other countries who would deny overflight permission, coming down from Georgia would have been quite feasible.
[00:19:21.511 --> 00:19:24.992]  And that, according to some reports, is what the Israelis had in mind.
[00:19:25.692 --> 00:19:27.572]  So the Russians came down real hard.
[00:19:28.073 --> 00:19:32.873]  Olmert went up to Russia, other people went up to Russia, and they said, look, it's all over.
[00:19:33.393 --> 00:19:35.054]  Don't even think about attacking Iran.
[00:19:35.094 --> 00:19:36.614]  And they said the same thing to us.
[00:19:37.378 --> 00:19:50.162]  And again, we intelligence analysts look at all sources, and we saw a very sharp fall off of all the warnings out of the White House about how bad Iran is, how it's supplying our opponents in Iraq, and how it's developing.
[00:19:50.602 --> 00:19:55.443]  They all fell right off in early August, and it's still pretty far down.
[00:19:55.783 --> 00:19:57.564]  Two other factors I've mentioned briefly.
[00:19:59.024 --> 00:20:01.385]  You know, AIPAC, the American, Israel,
[00:20:03.371 --> 00:20:03.711]  I don't
[00:20:21.278 --> 00:20:27.242]  Uh, which amounted to calling for President Bush to blockade Iran, an act of war, okay?
[00:20:27.882 --> 00:20:38.569]  Now, traditionally, when the Israelis draft this kind of legislation, they put the word out and a hundred representatives, you know, co-sponsor the thing, like, you know, like before you could say Jack Robinson, okay?
[00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:39.410]  And that happened.
[00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:40.451]  But guess what?
[00:20:41.912 --> 00:20:43.193]  And the same thing happened in the Senate.
[00:20:43.493 --> 00:20:43.993]  Guess what?
[00:20:44.273 --> 00:20:49.877]  Grassroots folks inundated their representatives with calls, with emails, with
[00:20:50.339 --> 00:20:55.141]  I think they also didn't want to fall victim to what I call the Hillary Clinton factor.
[00:20:55.261 --> 00:20:58.723]  You know, Hillary actually thought it would be a smart political move.
[00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:18.131]  When you voted for the war against Iraq... Alright, hold that thought, Ray.
[00:21:18.151 --> 00:21:19.512]  We're going to be with you after the break.
[00:21:19.532 --> 00:21:20.432]  We're going to take your calls.
[00:21:20.472 --> 00:21:21.873]  Ray McGovern, CI Analyst.
[00:21:21.953 --> 00:21:23.093]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:21:23.613 --> 00:21:25.894]  PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:21:36.078 --> 00:21:36.979]  We're on the march.
[00:21:37.479 --> 00:21:39.059]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.681]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:46.104 --> 00:21:49.865]  Drinking a chlorophyll-rich beverage has been found to benefit your entire body.
[00:21:50.085 --> 00:21:58.167]  AlkaVision GreenShield Green Drink is a specifically formulated nutritional supplement, which provides many nutritional elements that are missing from our modern diet.
[00:21:58.467 --> 00:22:02.508]  GreenShield helps neutralize acid in your body and maintains a healthy pH balance.
[00:22:02.708 --> 00:22:06.668]  And having the proper pH balance has been known to balance blood sugar levels.
[00:22:07.028 --> 00:22:08.209]  Something we can all benefit.
[00:22:08.669 --> 00:22:09.149]  Alright, Jason?
[00:22:09.409 --> 00:22:09.789]  Yes, sir?
[00:22:10.229 --> 00:22:13.450]  Alright, the callers' first step would be Mike in Washington.
[00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:14.010]  Okay.
[00:22:14.688 --> 00:22:16.649]  That's ALKAvision.com today.
[00:22:45.267 --> 00:22:52.360]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:54.423]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:22:55.379 --> 00:22:56.420]  But who is the enemy?
[00:22:56.921 --> 00:22:57.441]  Bin Laden.
[00:22:57.701 --> 00:22:58.703]  This is his ammo.
[00:22:58.723 --> 00:23:00.024]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:23:00.064 --> 00:23:01.746]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:23:02.066 --> 00:23:08.833]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:23:09.233 --> 00:23:09.674]  Some U.S.
[00:23:09.714 --> 00:23:15.380]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:19.523]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:23:19.543 --> 00:23:22.344]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:23:46.152 --> 00:23:47.993]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:23:48.113 --> 00:23:54.816]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:23:55.076 --> 00:24:03.260]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:09.203]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:24:09.383 --> 00:24:11.164]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:24:11.224 --> 00:24:13.385]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:24:13.405 --> 00:24:17.767]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:24:17.947 --> 00:24:20.048]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:24:20.168 --> 00:24:27.252]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:24:29.836 --> 00:24:34.537]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:34.577 --> 00:24:36.438]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:57.296 --> 00:24:58.217]  All right, folks, we're back.
[00:24:58.257 --> 00:24:59.237]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:59.317 --> 00:25:01.499]  I am Jason Bermas, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:25:02.399 --> 00:25:03.500]  We are with Ray McGovern.
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.721]  We're discussing the upcoming election.
[00:25:06.782 --> 00:25:11.845]  And he just mentioned that Hillary Clinton was a bit of a warmonger against Iran.
[00:25:11.905 --> 00:25:14.487]  I mean, she's pretty much said everything was on the table.
[00:25:14.547 --> 00:25:16.208]  I want him to finish up his point on that.
[00:25:16.228 --> 00:25:16.909]  And then I want to get
[00:25:17.489 --> 00:25:18.029]  Sure, yeah.
[00:25:42.864 --> 00:25:47.788]  The business about the attack on Iran being off the table, probably.
[00:25:47.808 --> 00:26:02.199]  I'll just finish up by saying that it was a grassroots effort, but many of the congressmen who actually had co-sponsored the bill withdrew that co-sponsorship, and I think it wasn't altogether altruistic.
[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:09.365]  I think they were thinking about two years from now, when they're running again, and there's a wider war still, and they voted for it.
[00:26:10.269 --> 00:26:13.351]  What I call the Hillary Clinton effect would set in.
[00:26:13.932 --> 00:26:21.017]  You'll recall that back in October 2002, she thought it was the politically smart thing to do, to vote for a war.
[00:26:21.477 --> 00:26:24.279]  Turned out to derail her attempt to be president.
[00:26:24.719 --> 00:26:32.785]  It will derail the attempts of others to be representatives or senators if they voted for a wider war, and that's why the whole thing was squashed.
[00:26:33.285 --> 00:26:38.009]  This is the first time in recent memory that I've seen a grassroots effort able to defeat
[00:26:40.277 --> 00:26:44.540]  Uh, legislation not only proposed by, but drafted by AIPAC.
[00:26:45.341 --> 00:26:47.723]  And the last thing, of course, is the financial crisis.
[00:26:48.683 --> 00:26:51.345]  I think everybody kind of realizes that we're running out of money.
[00:26:51.365 --> 00:26:55.388]  We're spending billions in Iraq and Afghanistan every week.
[00:26:56.109 --> 00:27:06.597]  So where do we get the money to get involved in a war with Iran, which is not at all like Iraq or Afghanistan, but rather a very
[00:27:07.068 --> 00:27:17.630]  Very strong country with lots of armed forces that dwarf in effectiveness what Saddam Hussein had before we attacked Iraq.
[00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:27.692]  So do you think there's a chance of this international crisis that Biden and Powell and other people in the Pentagon are now talking about in the first months of his presidency, if he gets in?
[00:27:29.432 --> 00:27:31.692]  Well, Joe Biden is not one of my favorites.
[00:27:32.072 --> 00:27:35.713]  He kind of runs off the mouth without thinking about what he's going to say.
[00:27:36.613 --> 00:27:41.437]  And we're also dealing again here with the political rhetoric rather than reality.
[00:27:42.798 --> 00:27:51.864]  My guess is that Biden was just trying to draw a parallel between Obama and JFK.
[00:27:51.884 --> 00:27:52.745]  See, even you did it!
[00:27:52.805 --> 00:27:54.566]  We can't just accuse the neocons now!
[00:27:56.888 --> 00:27:57.889]  That's alright, continue!
[00:27:58.730 --> 00:27:59.550]  My apologies.
[00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:00.251]  That's alright.
[00:28:00.951 --> 00:28:01.912]  Senior moment here.
[00:28:03.931 --> 00:28:12.959]  Yeah, it's always politically good to compare your candidate with John Kennedy for whom lots of people have continuing respect, including myself.
[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:18.944]  And we all know, at least those of us as old as I am, that Kennedy was confronted.
[00:28:18.964 --> 00:28:21.386]  He was young and he was confronted by Khrushchev.
[00:28:21.946 --> 00:28:24.148]  He was actually confronted by the CIA.
[00:28:24.228 --> 00:28:30.694]  He was confronted by our military when they decided to go through with that Bay of Pigs foolishness and then expected
[00:28:31.181 --> 00:28:35.722]  Kennedy did it to bail him out by sending the Air Force in to save these guys.
[00:28:36.262 --> 00:28:37.083]  They mousetrapped him.
[00:28:37.703 --> 00:28:47.966]  And so he was beset by all kinds of challenges, not only from Khrushchev in Vienna in May of 1961, but also the Bay of Pigs before that.
[00:28:48.646 --> 00:28:53.827]  And, you know, there was the Berlin, the trouble over Berlin access and everything else.
[00:28:53.867 --> 00:28:58.569]  So my guess, and it's only a guess, is that what Biden was referring to is, look, you know,
[00:28:59.838 --> 00:29:18.228]  Initially, braced and shocked by all this, he came through, and even when the challenge to us in Cuba with the Russians sending missiles down there, when that happened, he was able to handle that in a cool and collected way, but a strong way, and he made the Russians back down.
[00:29:18.328 --> 00:29:22.610]  That's the memory most of us have of JFK, but I think it's nothing more than that.
[00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:26.072]  I don't think Biden has any special... As a matter of fact,
[00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:32.755]  Given his record, he certainly has no special foresight or insight into what's going to happen over the next half a year.
[00:29:32.795 --> 00:29:33.916]  Well, I hope you're correct.
[00:29:34.016 --> 00:29:35.197]  All right, let's take some callers.
[00:29:35.818 --> 00:29:40.141]  I hear that Brian in Arizona disagrees, so you jump to the front of the line, Brian.
[00:29:40.361 --> 00:29:40.922]  What's on your mind?
[00:29:41.042 --> 00:29:42.203]  Hey, Brian, how are you?
[00:29:43.124 --> 00:29:43.944]  Hi, doing good.
[00:29:43.964 --> 00:29:44.365]  How are you?
[00:29:45.105 --> 00:29:46.406]  Good.
[00:29:47.487 --> 00:29:51.851]  First of all, I want to make one comment about what they're saying about Barack will be tested.
[00:29:52.242 --> 00:30:01.007]  I think they realize they need to warn everybody, and what they're going to stage is more false flag terrorism, but they need to brainwash the people and spill it in their minds first.
[00:30:01.627 --> 00:30:08.431]  And the one disagreement I have is about some footage that was used in a film, and better footage could have been used.
[00:30:09.371 --> 00:30:14.834]  I happen to personally know the guys from vthepentacon.com.
[00:30:15.242 --> 00:30:28.115]  And they actually have even newer testimony other than the two Pentagon police officers on site at the CITCO that said the plane came in a different route on 9-11 than what the government's official fairytale said.
[00:30:28.495 --> 00:30:30.497]  And they have Lloyd the cab driver now.
[00:30:30.857 --> 00:30:31.898]  They've re-interviewed him.
[00:30:31.958 --> 00:30:36.583]  They've gone out and they've seen the cab that was staged on the south side fly over.
[00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:40.633]  And even Lloyd's wife agrees that it was a Northside flyover.
[00:30:40.673 --> 00:30:42.534]  They've got a whole lot of new information.
[00:30:42.614 --> 00:30:45.697]  Yeah, you know, I like those guys and I like what they do.
[00:30:45.797 --> 00:30:54.964]  I just feel like focusing on one issue like that one, we're never going to get the 84 tapes that are still classified, you know, out to the public.
[00:30:55.044 --> 00:30:55.285]  I mean,
[00:30:55.865 --> 00:30:57.486]  God bless them for their research.
[00:30:57.506 --> 00:30:59.866]  We went out to DC with them two plus years ago.
[00:31:00.446 --> 00:31:01.747]  We interviewed Lloyd the cab driver.
[00:31:01.767 --> 00:31:04.348]  We interviewed the pastor who was the first on the scene.
[00:31:04.368 --> 00:31:04.908]  You can see there.
[00:31:05.168 --> 00:31:09.529]  We interviewed the first guy with a camera on the scene, Bob Pugh, where you saw his footage all over the AP.
[00:31:09.949 --> 00:31:11.290]  I just think that that issue
[00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:16.453]  It's just, it's more of a, you know, we already know they allowed whatever happened at the Pentagon to happen.
[00:31:16.493 --> 00:31:26.018]  I mean, that was something I've discussed with you years ago, Ray, is that Normanetta now, on six or seven different occasions, speaks about with, you know, whatever hit the Pentagon, we had about twenty...
[00:31:26.978 --> 00:31:29.058]  20 minutes beforehand to do something about it.
[00:31:29.298 --> 00:31:34.419]  We had, you know, 120 miles out, 100 miles out, 50 miles out, 20 miles out, to the order still stand.
[00:31:34.739 --> 00:31:43.541]  So I think that that's a more compelling issue, and to really focus on minutiae like that at this point is kind of, you know, it's counterproductive.
[00:31:43.561 --> 00:31:44.521]  I thank you for the call, Brian.
[00:31:44.541 --> 00:31:46.841]  Let's go to Mike in Washington.
[00:31:46.881 --> 00:31:47.682]  Mike, what's on your mind?
[00:31:47.702 --> 00:31:48.862]  Hey.
[00:31:49.402 --> 00:31:50.262]  Is this you, Mike?
[00:31:51.282 --> 00:31:51.482]  Hey.
[00:31:52.342 --> 00:31:55.443]  Hey, I'm just kind of off subject, but I have an idea for the iPhone.
[00:31:55.948 --> 00:31:57.109]  Okay.
[00:31:58.369 --> 00:32:02.712]  You know the Obama, you click on the widget and it brings up Obama's little site.
[00:32:03.072 --> 00:32:03.352]  Okay.
[00:32:03.973 --> 00:32:09.396]  I think Alex needs to have one of these so you can, if you look at Obama's thing, you can just go with it.
[00:32:09.416 --> 00:32:16.279]  Well, I'll tell you what, right now I'm looking at Infowars.com and he's got something on the right that says, listen to the Alex Jones Show live on your cell phone.
[00:32:16.319 --> 00:32:18.240]  So, maybe you can do that.
[00:32:18.481 --> 00:32:19.861]  I mean, that's probably coming up.
[00:32:19.901 --> 00:32:21.402]  We're moving into new offices.
[00:32:21.442 --> 00:32:22.603]  We're trying to put together new things.
[00:32:22.663 --> 00:32:23.863]  I'm putting together my own show.
[00:32:24.904 --> 00:32:27.886]  We're trying to become more of a mainstream outlet to people.
[00:32:27.926 --> 00:32:29.147]  I mean, we can only do so much.
[00:32:29.167 --> 00:32:45.841]  I mean, when you literally have a staff, and I'm not part of that staff, I'm a staff of one, but when you have a staff like Alex of ten people and two of those guys work in the newsroom and they're also your main editors, I mean, they're also your main cameraman, it is tough to do everything, but we do need your help.
[00:32:46.161 --> 00:32:47.482]  Alright, let's jump to yet another call.
[00:32:47.502 --> 00:32:49.584]  Let's go to Carlisle in Texas.
[00:32:49.624 --> 00:32:52.126]  Carlisle, you're on the line with Ray McGovern and myself.
[00:32:53.601 --> 00:32:56.783]  Hey, I actually have something to plug.
[00:32:56.803 --> 00:32:59.225]  It's kind of off the subject from what you guys have been talking about.
[00:32:59.385 --> 00:32:59.645]  Okay.
[00:33:00.046 --> 00:33:07.591]  But it has to do with how Chief Osvedo wants to use the federal grants to forcibly take people's blood that refuse breathalyzers.
[00:33:07.951 --> 00:33:08.252]  Okay.
[00:33:08.812 --> 00:33:13.135]  And I know Alex Jones had Chief Osvedo on about that.
[00:33:13.175 --> 00:33:18.199]  He was saying how he wants to have a dialogue and engage the public, but we've been trying to contact him for the last four months.
[00:33:18.639 --> 00:33:22.442]  So what we were going to do was on Halloween night at 9 o'clock on 4th and LaVaca,
[00:33:23.137 --> 00:33:31.299]  We're going to stage a protest to try and get him to actually come down here and explain how that program is supposed to prevent drunk driving, but it doesn't prevent it at all.
[00:33:31.539 --> 00:33:33.739]  Okay, so what time is that going to take place?
[00:33:34.559 --> 00:33:37.080]  It's going to be at 9 o'clock on Friday, on Halloween night.
[00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:38.120]  Okay, alright man.
[00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:38.720]  You got it.
[00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:39.340]  Thanks for the plug.
[00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:42.381]  Alright, let's jump to Andy in North Carolina.
[00:33:42.461 --> 00:33:43.201]  Andy, what's on your mind?
[00:33:44.581 --> 00:33:45.621]  Mr. McGovern, how are you, sir?
[00:33:46.422 --> 00:33:46.942]  Hi, Andy.
[00:33:47.342 --> 00:33:47.922]  Hey, Jason.
[00:33:47.962 --> 00:33:48.422]  How are you, bud?
[00:33:48.442 --> 00:33:48.762]  Good, man.
[00:33:49.284 --> 00:33:58.931]  Hey, listen, Mr. McGovern, I was going to ask you and correct me if I'm wrong to mention that you were slightly dismayed by the fact that Hillary didn't get the nomination.
[00:34:00.992 --> 00:34:12.360]  Not dismayed, just really, really, really, really, really happy that someone who did something crass for political purpose, and as a result 4,200 U.S.
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.480]  servicemen are killed,
[00:34:16.366 --> 00:34:19.469]  That it turned out to be just the opposite of what she expected.
[00:34:19.949 --> 00:34:25.594]  The war turned sour, and the person who was against the war from the beginning won the nomination.
[00:34:26.035 --> 00:34:33.641]  That should be an object lesson to all people who make important decisions based on their ambitions to be president, or whatever.
[00:34:33.661 --> 00:34:42.249]  Well, I certainly agree that, you know, to see Hillary go down is a good thing, and that is a victory if that's the case.
[00:34:42.911 --> 00:34:45.014]  Uh, my thing is, is a little bit larger point.
[00:34:45.455 --> 00:34:55.469]  I was left dumbfounded because I was, I guess I had become intellectually lazy that, you know, Hillary was going to be given the nomination and we would just continue as we had because I figured that Bush was going to create this police state.
[00:34:55.928 --> 00:35:00.491]  If he's going to leave it, he's going to leave it to someone that's going to continue on that thing.
[00:35:00.531 --> 00:35:09.237]  And I think while we were all sleeping, and maybe you could speak to this, or maybe you disagree, that this thing that Tarpley talked about, I used to think he was a windbag, really, but I got to listen to him.
[00:35:09.637 --> 00:35:17.122]  This whole Obama thing and the fascism thing, he's on to it, and I think that maybe we've sleptwalked through this, and we're going to get a dictator that everybody loves.
[00:35:17.182 --> 00:35:17.783]  Rick and Reno?
[00:35:20.046 --> 00:35:22.666]  Well let me say this, I'm definitely fearful of that.
[00:35:23.047 --> 00:35:30.968]  I think Tarpley has somewhat of an ultra perspective on, you know, Obama bringing, you know, super fascism to the United States.
[00:35:31.128 --> 00:35:31.748]  I don't see that.
[00:35:32.028 --> 00:35:38.629]  But I do, unfortunately, I mean, I differ from Mr. McGovern and I do see him bringing in more globalization.
[00:35:38.669 --> 00:35:40.730]  I did not like his speech in Berlin again.
[00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:45.130]  I mean, a million and a half man youth brigade talking about global citizenship.
[00:35:45.991 --> 00:35:47.771]  He seems to be on the wrong side of the coin on the
[00:35:48.191 --> 00:35:51.172]  Carbon tax debate, and I think a lot of people are going to love him.
[00:35:51.432 --> 00:35:57.153]  Like I said, I disagree with Tarpley, where he says that Obama isn't that well-spoken, and he stutters and stammers.
[00:35:57.193 --> 00:36:00.534]  I don't see that much at all, and I watch him in extended periods of time.
[00:36:00.874 --> 00:36:03.454]  I see him as a confident man who can look you in the eye.
[00:36:03.834 --> 00:36:08.095]  He can orate well, and he is good with his hands and his head motion.
[00:36:08.115 --> 00:36:13.196]  I mean, he's very good at answering questions and seeming credible and smart.
[00:36:13.276 --> 00:36:15.096]  So, you know, I don't see that.
[00:36:15.136 --> 00:36:16.917]  Do you want to speak to that, Mr. McGovern?
[00:36:16.937 --> 00:36:17.497]  What do you think?
[00:36:17.777 --> 00:36:19.078]  I mean, obviously you're in support of them.
[00:36:20.639 --> 00:36:22.720]  Well, you know, compared to what sort of thing?
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:25.481]  And you're quite right, we're going to have to wait and see.
[00:36:27.443 --> 00:36:33.286]  But I'm less concerned about the global aspects that seem to trouble so many people.
[00:36:34.527 --> 00:36:38.429]  If adopting a global perspective means
[00:36:39.313 --> 00:37:03.539]  Going back and realizing that the new guidelines for war, for example, was set up after World War II and resulted in the Charter of the United Nations, which prohibits any country from conducting a preventive attack or a, quote, preemptive, end quote, attack of the kind that Bush and Cheney have done.
[00:37:04.619 --> 00:37:06.560]  You're not allowed to attack another country
[00:37:07.233 --> 00:37:30.195]  Unless there's an imminent threat to your country, and nobody argues there was an imminent threat, this crew thought they could change not only international law as contained in the UN Charter, but national law, because as you know, once the Senate approves such a charter, and it did something like 95 to 2, once the Senate approves it, it becomes law of the land.
[00:37:30.774 --> 00:37:39.938]  And so a war of aggression is just not a really good thing to do, and to be Obama is focusing in on this kind of thing, that we would have a modicum of respect for the law.
[00:37:40.338 --> 00:37:42.999]  Well, I hack my hats off to that kind of perspective.
[00:37:43.619 --> 00:37:45.940]  All right, let's jump to Ryan in Kentucky.
[00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:46.901]  Ryan, what's on your mind?
[00:37:48.321 --> 00:38:00.326]  Let's talk about the recent news, the public health emergency for anthrax, botulism, and smallpox until 2015, and how that could possibly play into the future.
[00:38:00.859 --> 00:38:10.230]  And also on how the Coast Guard is actually the agency in charge of a biotech or a pandemic flu relief.
[00:38:10.612 --> 00:38:13.833]  Well, to be honest, I don't really know much about this new warning.
[00:38:14.133 --> 00:38:17.314]  Maybe you could send that over to erinainfowars.com.
[00:38:17.334 --> 00:38:19.995]  I mean, again, some things slip through the cracks here.
[00:38:20.015 --> 00:38:21.075]  We don't get everything.
[00:38:21.095 --> 00:38:26.737]  We try to report as much as we can on our four-hour radio show, but that is something, a point of interest we would be into.
[00:38:26.777 --> 00:38:29.358]  So please email that to erinainfowars.com.
[00:38:29.378 --> 00:38:31.518]  Alright, let's go to Rick in Reno.
[00:38:31.598 --> 00:38:32.439]  Rick, what's on your mind?
[00:38:33.739 --> 00:38:36.700]  Is Obama going to have the coattails to end this war?
[00:38:37.731 --> 00:38:41.532]  Well, I mean, I'll let Ray answer that on his perspective.
[00:38:41.612 --> 00:38:43.773]  Obviously, he's optimistic and hopeful that he does.
[00:38:43.893 --> 00:38:44.673]  I don't believe so.
[00:38:44.834 --> 00:38:47.334]  I mean, I see these de-escalation plans.
[00:38:47.354 --> 00:38:48.275]  They're already in place.
[00:38:48.295 --> 00:38:51.316]  They're talking about they're going to take a few thousand here and a few thousand there.
[00:38:51.996 --> 00:38:56.758]  But all it will take, in my mind at least, is an insurgency to keep the excuse to have
[00:38:57.518 --> 00:38:58.418]  Have these people there.
[00:38:58.579 --> 00:39:01.760]  I mean, Obama's been very slick with his stance on the war.
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:06.982]  He's, you know, obviously said that we have to take care of problems at home before we can take care of problems abroad.
[00:39:07.463 --> 00:39:08.623]  He's very well spoken.
[00:39:08.923 --> 00:39:11.345]  But I will leave that question to Mr. McGovern.
[00:39:11.365 --> 00:39:13.205]  Do you think he's going to end this war?
[00:39:15.226 --> 00:39:18.428]  Well, you know, the war is over, folks.
[00:39:19.708 --> 00:39:21.789]  The Iraqis have invited us out.
[00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:27.152]  We cannot stay there legally past the 31st of December.
[00:39:28.477 --> 00:39:38.181]  Uh, we will stay past the 31st of December, but we will incur the opprobrium of the whole world and the Iraqis.
[00:39:38.862 --> 00:39:45.144]  So, it's just a matter of time, and it's just a matter of setting the timetable for withdrawal.
[00:39:45.765 --> 00:39:57.590]  Now, if we linger on like we did in Saigon and in Barentsvier and South Vietnam, then it's going to be a case of picking up the residual American presence off the rooftops of the
[00:39:58.832 --> 00:40:03.354]  The billion-dollar embassy we've just created there in the Green Zone, and it's going to be a horror.
[00:40:04.074 --> 00:40:05.895]  But, it need not be so.
[00:40:06.335 --> 00:40:08.656]  We need to listen to the Iraqis.
[00:40:09.096 --> 00:40:11.077]  70% of the Iraqis, according to U.S.
[00:40:11.197 --> 00:40:14.978]  Army-sponsored surveys, 70% want us out of there.
[00:40:15.179 --> 00:40:15.459]  Okay?
[00:40:15.979 --> 00:40:26.683]  So all we have to do is disavow any intention to grab more than our share of the oil, disavow any intention to build permanent military bases,
[00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:33.251]  And just say, okay, you can take this for real, international community.
[00:40:33.771 --> 00:40:43.154]  And then and only then, you know, will the Arab League countries, India, Pakistan, the West Europeans, they'll come in behind us and help us exit as gracefully as we can.
[00:40:43.674 --> 00:40:50.515]  Because they like us now, they all hate us by now, but they're interested, they're more interested in stability in that area than we are.
[00:40:50.635 --> 00:40:53.856]  And of course, they're also interested in getting a portion of the oil.
[00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:55.141]  So it's over.
[00:40:55.161 --> 00:41:07.812]  It's just a matter of whether we linger for two, three, four more years and take the kinds of casualties that we've had since the surge, or whether we, in a more enlightened way, say, okay, Malachy, we understand the pressures you're under.
[00:41:08.153 --> 00:41:14.218]  We're not going to press you to stay any longer than you want us, and just help us exit in as graceful a way as is possible.
[00:41:14.659 --> 00:41:20.184]  That's the answer, and for those who, you know, think that we have to stay there to referee
[00:41:20.987 --> 00:41:26.014]  A civil war between the Sunni and Shia, I mean, that just doesn't parse for me.
[00:41:26.034 --> 00:41:32.583]  I don't want one American young man or woman to perish because we're refereeing a civil war.
[00:41:32.963 --> 00:41:35.046]  And that's pretty much what it comes down to right now.
[00:41:35.948 --> 00:41:36.589]  I'm with you there.
[00:41:37.785 --> 00:41:48.149]  Ray, you just talked about the oil, and I was just wondering your opinion on whether or not this current economic crisis is going to continue to drop the price of oil by the barrel.
[00:41:48.169 --> 00:41:50.550]  How is this going to affect the oil industry?
[00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:56.913]  Do you think that they're just going to subside on their massive profits they've taken in the last four years for a little while?
[00:41:56.933 --> 00:42:02.816]  Do you think they're doing this to maybe make the economic crisis a little less worse?
[00:42:02.856 --> 00:42:03.776]  What's your take on that?
[00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:21.610]  The price of oil fluctuates depending on how big a threat there seems to be in the Persian Gulf, and I think the oil companies are seeing, what I reported earlier, that there's less likely to be a wider war there, and that the U.S.
[00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:22.611]  will have to depart.
[00:42:23.231 --> 00:42:34.979]  Now, the problem remains, because, as I said to countless audiences, one of the most important factoids in the international situation is that the world is running out of oil.
[00:42:35.882 --> 00:42:40.066]  And, uh, you know, so in a very real sense, you could look at the attack on Iraq.
[00:42:55.382 --> 00:43:07.214]  Now, the problem remains because, you know, as I've said to countless audiences, one of the most important factoids in the international situation is that the world is running out of oil.
[00:43:08.055 --> 00:43:12.200]  And, you know, so in a very real sense, you can look at the attack on Iraq.
[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:14.281]  Alright, Ray, I do have to let you go.
[00:43:14.301 --> 00:43:15.041]  We're about to go to break.
[00:43:15.081 --> 00:43:16.001]  I thank you so much.
[00:43:16.041 --> 00:43:18.362]  Treatment is what everyone has been waiting for.
[00:43:18.642 --> 00:43:21.803]  A simple, easy way to eliminate the threat of cancer.
[00:43:22.103 --> 00:43:24.123]  Laser technology at its best.

[00:43:29.865 --> 00:43:30.205]  Thank you.
[00:43:45.774 --> 00:43:47.435]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:43:47.736 --> 00:43:51.178]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:43:51.358 --> 00:43:53.200]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:56.542]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:43:56.843 --> 00:44:02.307]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:44:02.587 --> 00:44:06.490]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[00:44:43.888 --> 00:44:44.649]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:44:45.839 --> 00:44:48.781]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:44:48.941 --> 00:44:54.185]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:44:54.465 --> 00:44:59.789]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:45:00.169 --> 00:45:01.290]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:10.537]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membrane.
[00:45:10.957 --> 00:45:12.598]  Now, compare a Calvin Pure Soap.
[00:45:12.799 --> 00:45:16.982]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[00:45:54.173 --> 00:46:01.400]  Folks, it's the final segment one week before the presidential election, and this show brings you every perspective.
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:01.820]  I mean,
[00:46:02.987 --> 00:46:09.332]  Truly, folks, I mean, we had Webster Tarpley on for 90 minutes today, if you missed it, and he was wildly against Obama.
[00:46:09.372 --> 00:46:15.016]  We just had Ray McGovern on for the last 60 and he's trying to promote you to vote for Barack Obama.
[00:46:15.076 --> 00:46:20.901]  Of course, I myself am trying to get you to vote third party and vote your heart, much like Jesse Ventura.
[00:46:21.701 --> 00:46:23.342]  And all those perspectives today were covered.
[00:46:23.683 --> 00:46:26.064]  And we had Willie Nelson on his famous tour bus.
[00:46:26.184 --> 00:46:30.247]  Exclusive stuff, not even on the web yet, not even over at Infowars.com yet.
[00:46:30.708 --> 00:46:33.510]  You can look for that to be posted later on this evening.
[00:46:33.550 --> 00:46:38.613]  Remember, all this rebroadcasts in a matter of six minutes over at Infowars.com for free.
[00:46:38.813 --> 00:46:44.798]  The way you support us is you become a PrisonPlanet.tv member and you burn all of our movies, all of our documentaries.
[00:46:45.558 --> 00:46:49.019]  All of our information to disk you handed out and you spread the word.
[00:46:49.179 --> 00:46:51.739]  Alright, in the last few minutes I'm just going to run through some calls here.
[00:46:51.819 --> 00:46:53.540]  Let's go to Donnie in the UK.
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:54.160]  What's up Donnie?
[00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:56.440]  Hello.
[00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:57.721]  Yes, what's on your mind sir?
[00:46:58.761 --> 00:47:03.242]  Hi Jason, I'd just like to say I'm really pleased that I get through.
[00:47:03.282 --> 00:47:06.462]  I've been trying to get through the show for a couple of months now.
[00:47:07.083 --> 00:47:11.503]  What led me to you guys was a video called No End in Sight about the Iraq War.
[00:47:11.844 --> 00:47:12.064]  Okay.
[00:47:12.244 --> 00:47:14.084]  Which I was pretty disgusted with.
[00:47:15.167 --> 00:47:25.897]  So that led me onto you guys and now everywhere I look I can see things that Alex is talking about, he's been speaking about for months and I'm trying to tell people.
[00:47:27.961 --> 00:47:29.463]  Well, what other videos do you have out there?
[00:47:29.503 --> 00:47:30.784]  Those are the tools, man.
[00:47:30.804 --> 00:47:34.247]  I mean, it's one thing to step up to somebody and talk to them.
[00:47:34.448 --> 00:47:50.044]  You know, you can get a light to start to switch on, but when you hand them an info bomb like the movie that, you know, No End in Sight that brought you out, maybe you should be making copies of that, or Iraq for Sale, or my films, Loose Change, Final Cut, Fabled Enemies, Alex's films, Endgames.
[00:47:50.484 --> 00:47:52.785]  First, you have to educate yourself and get the information.
[00:47:53.145 --> 00:48:02.370]  Then, I always tell people, the next level is to set up a little burner, something that you can copy this information to, and then, you know, get a point of interest with somebody.
[00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:06.993]  In other words, an agreement point, somewhere where you can relate to them, and then hand off the DVD.
[00:48:07.013 --> 00:48:08.413]  That's how you're going to reach the masses.
[00:48:08.754 --> 00:48:09.354]  Continue, Donnie.
[00:48:11.035 --> 00:48:12.396]  Yeah.
[00:48:13.216 --> 00:48:18.719]  I did notice a couple of weeks ago in Glasgow, where I live, a private car with a
[00:48:19.431 --> 00:48:19.631]  Can I
[00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:32.713]  The machines they use in New York, the sound detectors?
[00:48:32.733 --> 00:48:51.350]  Oh yeah, well what those are, and I thank you for the call because I've got a couple other ones, those aren't sound detectors, those are sound wave weapons and they're using those not only in domestic cases with the National Guard like they did at the DNC and the RNC in 2004, but they're now using it for military applications and when they point it at you and fire it literally feels like you're
[00:48:52.091 --> 00:48:56.096]  Whole body is aflame, and you just want to move the quickest possible.
[00:48:56.136 --> 00:48:58.459]  There's different levels, different frequencies.
[00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:01.362]  It can go further, it can be lighter.
[00:49:01.643 --> 00:49:02.924]  It's literally like a ray gun.
[00:49:03.024 --> 00:49:03.965]  It's pretty crazy.
[00:49:05.267 --> 00:49:07.830]  Let's jump to Mark in Georgia.
[00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:08.751]  Mark, what's on your mind?
[00:49:10.593 --> 00:49:11.014]  You with me, Mark?
[00:49:12.802 --> 00:49:13.862]  Okay, may we drop Mark?
[00:49:15.003 --> 00:49:16.723]  Let's go to... Yes sir, what's up?
[00:49:17.364 --> 00:49:18.324]  There we go, hallelujah.
[00:49:18.604 --> 00:49:21.185]  I forgot, never mind.
[00:49:21.285 --> 00:49:22.925]  Yeah, quite quickly.
[00:49:23.906 --> 00:49:27.727]  The Status of Forces Agreement is dead in the water, according to what I've read.
[00:49:27.787 --> 00:49:39.291]  The Iraqi representatives know that it's political poison, and with this not being ratified, it's like basically we can't stay there without this agreement.
[00:49:40.054 --> 00:49:43.896]  Without our forces being subject to their law.
[00:49:44.036 --> 00:49:48.898]  In other words, you know, you rape or murder somebody, we lock you up and we put you on trial.
[00:49:48.918 --> 00:49:51.239]  Yeah, but that seems to me like it's going to be political rhetoric.
[00:49:51.279 --> 00:49:53.880]  I don't think there's going to be any nuts behind that at all.
[00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:57.901]  Just like Ray McGovern says, we're not leaving at the end of January.
[00:49:58.081 --> 00:49:58.702]  You know what I'm saying?
[00:49:58.962 --> 00:50:03.624]  And they're not going to start convicting or prosecuting members of Blackwater or our military.
[00:50:04.364 --> 00:50:06.305]  I am not as optimistic as Mr. McGovern.
[00:50:06.325 --> 00:50:08.186]  I don't see this change coming with Obama.
[00:50:08.526 --> 00:50:08.846]  I see
[00:50:09.426 --> 00:50:13.071]  I don't see the dark future that Tarpley has, but definitely leaning towards that way.
[00:50:13.171 --> 00:50:14.072]  I am Jason Bermas.
[00:50:14.132 --> 00:50:15.474]  I subbed in for Alex Jones today.
[00:50:15.754 --> 00:50:17.717]  InfoWars.com for the refeed right now!
