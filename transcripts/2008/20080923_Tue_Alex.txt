[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.610]  We're going to do something with Iran.
[00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.271]  Well, I would say this, sir, you should step down.
[00:00:05.331 --> 00:00:06.612]  You're unfit for command.
[00:00:07.412 --> 00:00:20.959]  To underestimate your enemy, or to even under, how do I say this, underlisten to or not hear what's being said is a tragedy, and it's a failure of leadership on an unparalleled level.
[00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:23.640]  So I would have to say to that man, are you nuts?
[00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.162]  Are you basically, are you taking a little bit of wacky tabacky to make it through the day?
[00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:29.861]  Something's wrong, Alex.
[00:00:30.081 --> 00:00:31.842]  We are being totally encircled.
[00:00:32.042 --> 00:00:34.024]  Now again, Steve Quayle is our guest.
[00:00:34.084 --> 00:00:38.567]  The United States had criminal forces within it orchestrate and carry out the 9-11 attacks.
[00:00:39.027 --> 00:00:45.592]  Then that was meant to come out, but only, as I said, day one on the day of the event, seven years ago, to be blamed on the U.S.
[00:00:45.632 --> 00:00:46.052]  government.
[00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:52.097]  Then the United States orchestrates a sneak attack on Russian territory, so internationally we're even seen as more criminal.
[00:00:53.077 --> 00:00:59.879]  The CIA releases the torture photos and videos, admittedly to CBS, to further demonize the United States.
[00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:16.742]  The engineered collapse of the country is now being carried out, and our name is being collapsed, so that when we are fully brought down into a depression, release bioweapons, atomic attack, whatever it may be, then everybody says we deserve that.
[00:01:17.122 --> 00:01:17.983]  You can see this.
[00:01:19.104 --> 00:01:20.986]  The New World Order are masters of betrayal.
[00:01:21.367 --> 00:01:23.989]  And they move from nation to nation, betraying those nations.
[00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.773]  They always betray their host nation as well.
[00:01:28.194 --> 00:01:30.656]  Betrayal is a sacrament for them.
[00:01:30.897 --> 00:01:34.220]  For folks watching in PrisonPlanet.tv, I decided to go ahead and go live.
[00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.622]  This interview was so important.
[00:01:35.642 --> 00:01:38.865]  We're an hour plus into it with Steve Quayle.
[00:01:38.885 --> 00:01:39.325]  He'll be with us.
[00:01:39.986 --> 00:01:41.027]  Well, let's do the rest of the hour.
[00:01:41.047 --> 00:01:41.667]  He said he'd do it.
[00:01:42.028 --> 00:01:44.850]  And we'll take your phone calls when we get back.
[00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:51.015]  In fact, for InfoWars.com stream listeners, I'm going to skip this break right now.
[00:01:51.595 --> 00:01:54.657]  And we will come back for everybody else on the other side with Steve Quayle.
[00:01:54.677 --> 00:01:55.118]  Stay with us.
[00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.871]  Steve, I don't want to waste any of this time.
[00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:05.896]  We're going to come back in three minutes with a full AM and FM shortwave audience, but right now we're on the internet with tens of thousands listening and watching.
[00:02:06.356 --> 00:02:10.339]  So let's continue with the setup of America.
[00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:16.824]  Everything to position us, use our treasure, use our currency, use our inventions, use our labor to build the world government.
[00:02:17.124 --> 00:02:19.726]  They wrap it in an American flag domestically, so we went along with it.
[00:02:20.106 --> 00:02:22.628]  Now we're at the point where we're being sucked dry.
[00:02:22.688 --> 00:02:23.389]  Now the betrayal.
[00:02:24.056 --> 00:02:28.979]  Well, the betrayal, and it's interesting because you can't use the word betrayal without including the word treachery.
[00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:39.184]  And I remember, Alex, in interviewing some of the Russian spies I talked to, they used to say to me, and I'm not making fun, I mean, one of them said, Oh, Steve, we had everybody on our payroll.
[00:02:39.564 --> 00:02:40.885]  And the guy literally talked like that.
[00:02:40.905 --> 00:02:42.286]  And I said, What did you mean by that?
[00:02:42.786 --> 00:02:44.387]  And he said, Simple.
[00:02:44.807 --> 00:02:49.089]  He said, What was amazing to us is how cheap we could buy your leaders.
[00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:50.850]  Now, Alex, that pissed me off.
[00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.411]  Okay, sorry for the word, but it did.
[00:02:53.078 --> 00:03:00.702]  And I said to this gentleman, I said, are you absolutely pulling my leg, or was it that cheap?
[00:03:00.762 --> 00:03:01.943]  And he said, oh no.
[00:03:01.983 --> 00:03:04.524]  He says, and of course when we can't buy, we blackmail.
[00:03:05.004 --> 00:03:15.770]  What most people don't understand is that in this world of Illuminism, when someone is even thought maybe to toe the line, they'll be blackmailed, they'll be compromised, whatever.
[00:03:16.243 --> 00:03:17.783]  They'll be photographed, whatever.
[00:03:17.923 --> 00:03:20.724]  And that's why you see such strange behavior.
[00:03:21.184 --> 00:03:25.125]  One minute someone's saying, I'm calling for an inquest, and the next minute, well, everything's fine.
[00:03:25.585 --> 00:03:28.686]  The point is, whom they can't blackmail and bribe, they kill.
[00:03:29.126 --> 00:03:31.947]  And that's the same story that we're dealing with daily.
[00:03:31.967 --> 00:03:33.747]  Now, here's where we're at, in my opinion.
[00:03:34.307 --> 00:03:38.148]  And we are no longer at, Alex, we're not warning about what's coming.
[00:03:38.288 --> 00:03:40.409]  Everything you and I have warned about is here.
[00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.102]  Everything you and I have warned about is being implemented.
[00:03:44.822 --> 00:03:46.864]  And it's only going to get more intense from here.
[00:03:46.904 --> 00:03:52.289]  Before the tyranny would go up and down, back and forth.
[00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:53.730]  Now it's just an escalation?
[00:03:55.471 --> 00:03:56.612]  Well, yeah, absolutely.
[00:03:56.652 --> 00:03:57.213]  Can I say this?
[00:03:57.273 --> 00:03:58.254]  It's going to go up and down.
[00:03:58.314 --> 00:04:04.879]  And what's really hard for people to understand is there are factions in the Illuminati.
[00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.163]  There are some incredibly brave men and women fighting this stuff.
[00:04:09.488 --> 00:04:18.930]  But then you get into the supernatural realm, and there comes a point where if a nation says to God, leave us alone, God says, I'll leave you alone, and I'll take my hand of protection away.
[00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:22.310]  And that's where I believe we are in the United States of America.
[00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.671]  I am so worried, and I mean this.
[00:04:25.011 --> 00:04:31.712]  Look, the bottom line is you don't do talk radio for 15 years and not learn a few things.
[00:04:31.772 --> 00:04:38.693]  But what I'm really, really troubled by is the continual denial, even people listening to your show.
[00:04:39.495 --> 00:04:44.960]  My show, our shows, what more information can you Alex Jones give them?
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.541]  What more information can I give them?
[00:04:46.581 --> 00:04:47.642]  Like we're talking off the air.
[00:04:48.022 --> 00:04:55.788]  It's one thing to have a thousand, five thousand, ten thousand, but you know, the Congress should be inundated with millions of people saying, stop the bailout!
[00:04:56.029 --> 00:05:00.973]  It's not helping the American people, it's putting the taxpayers... No, it's putting a millstone around our neck.
[00:05:01.173 --> 00:05:05.036]  Here we go, we're going back into the full audience right now with Steve Quill going to the phone calls.
[00:05:12.208 --> 00:05:16.109]  Maureen in Virginia, you're on the air with Steve Quayle.
[00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:17.050]  Thank you for holding.
[00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.550]  Welcome.
[00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:22.091]  Hi, it's an honor to be able to talk to either or both of you.
[00:05:22.491 --> 00:05:28.874]  Steve, I only heard your show three times in my life, each time you had Mike McQuitty on.
[00:05:29.574 --> 00:05:35.356]  Please tell the people what Mike McQuitty said about God setting up cities of refuge.
[00:05:36.016 --> 00:05:39.237]  And I know for a fact this is happening because he called me away from
[00:05:42.886 --> 00:05:46.368]  Well, first of all, I think that's really an important timely point.
[00:05:46.468 --> 00:05:52.552]  God never, never does anything except He doesn't reveal it to the people that are going to be judged.
[00:05:52.672 --> 00:05:54.753]  He also provides a place of escape.
[00:05:55.153 --> 00:06:05.519]  Throughout the land, Alex, and what the caller is talking about, people have been spoken to in dreams and visions, in prayer, to prepare for an onslaught of God's children.
[00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:06.680]  People are going to be running
[00:06:07.048 --> 00:06:20.719]  From the cities for their very lives, and I believe that my ministry as a watchman is over, but I believe my ministry as someone who's going to be taking care of a lot of the fleeing, frightened flock is just beginning.
[00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:25.122]  So I would just tell the caller that Mike and God bless him.
[00:06:25.223 --> 00:06:27.064]  Do you remember, too, one of the statements he made?
[00:06:27.084 --> 00:06:30.847]  He said, once the bleeding in America starts, it won't stop.
[00:06:31.227 --> 00:06:35.731]  And you know, I live with that statement of his in my mind almost every day, with no exaggeration.
[00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:42.172]  Once the bleeding starts, in other words, Alex, once all the killing starts and all the revolutionary thing, it's going to go non-stop.
[00:06:42.212 --> 00:06:51.217]  Yeah, once the veneer of civilization peels away, once the shooting starts, once the implosion starts, it won't be just New Orleans.
[00:06:51.257 --> 00:06:53.638]  The whole country could become like New Orleans.
[00:06:53.938 --> 00:06:58.120]  Absolutely, and I would tell, seriously, when somebody says, what's the most important thing to do to survive?
[00:06:58.161 --> 00:07:00.021]  I say, are you worried about this life or the next?
[00:07:00.122 --> 00:07:01.702]  Because both are an issue.
[00:07:01.762 --> 00:07:04.604]  It doesn't do any good to rail against the New World Order just to go to hell.
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:17.590]  And you know, that's a funny thing because I've talked to literally special forces guys that go into the bowels of the earth and everything that people have seen or read in Dante's Inferno or, you know, any of the Hollywood projections.
[00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.673]  I asked one special operations guy, probably one of the bravest men in the world.
[00:07:21.693 --> 00:07:24.034]  I mean, I don't know how you could be braver.
[00:07:24.115 --> 00:07:28.518]  I said, so explain to me what you encounter when you go and deal with the stuff underground.
[00:07:28.558 --> 00:07:31.580]  He said, have you ever seen the movie The Cave or Descent?
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.782]  I said, no, I have now, but I hadn't at the time.
[00:07:34.198 --> 00:07:38.340]  He said, go look at those two movies, The Cave and the Descent, and then multiply it by a thousand.
[00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:40.580]  And I said, boy, my brother.
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.721]  And I said, you guys are on a different planet.
[00:07:42.821 --> 00:07:46.602]  Your bravery and your love for the Lord is so exemplary.
[00:07:46.743 --> 00:07:49.524]  I mean, it blew me away, Alex.
[00:07:49.764 --> 00:07:50.544]  Pretty wild stuff.
[00:07:50.784 --> 00:07:51.824]  Maureen, thank you for the call.
[00:07:52.365 --> 00:07:54.965]  We're going to go and order the callers here.
[00:07:55.005 --> 00:07:57.166]  Buddy in Ohio, you're on the air, buddy.
[00:07:57.206 --> 00:07:57.646]  Go ahead.
[00:07:58.547 --> 00:08:01.188]  Yeah, Alex, I just want to say I appreciate everything you're doing, man.
[00:08:02.825 --> 00:08:04.346]  I just got a couple quick questions.
[00:08:04.406 --> 00:08:12.532]  I was just wondering, me and my next-door neighbor were talking the other day, and we were just wondering, on this whole gold situation, if there's still any gold in Fort Knox?
[00:08:13.293 --> 00:08:21.599]  No, they haven't had an audit in that in, what, more than 40 years, and the gold reserves have been basically handed over to the private banks, looted long ago.
[00:08:21.659 --> 00:08:23.160]  Steve Quayle, you want to answer that question?
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.581]  You nailed it, Alex.
[00:08:24.661 --> 00:08:27.183]  There is no gold in Fort Knox.
[00:08:27.283 --> 00:08:30.145]  It's been loaned out in the gold-loaning program especially.
[00:08:30.975 --> 00:08:37.761]  During the Clinton years, followed up by every president that basically came on, they looted the gold.
[00:08:38.162 --> 00:08:42.705]  The point is that it was given to central banks, loaned to banks, and then the banks sold the gold.
[00:08:43.066 --> 00:08:45.808]  Then it was re-loaned to the people they sold it to, and on and on and on.
[00:08:46.028 --> 00:08:48.891]  What's going to be interesting, though, the colonies know this.
[00:08:49.331 --> 00:08:57.298]  China, with its 20,000 reported tons of gold, and Russia, with its close to a trillion dollars worth of gold,
[00:08:57.874 --> 00:08:58.514]  Yes, we are.
[00:09:10.387 --> 00:09:28.724]  Well they've been saying the last few weeks that they may create a regional currency over there and absolutely backed by oil and gold and John already holds most of the debt here, the largest portion, apportionment of that, so certainly that is just unprecedented changes are coming.
[00:09:29.164 --> 00:09:31.767]  I would think that the Pentagon should have a financial
[00:09:32.541 --> 00:09:36.364]  I was just wondering, is there any new information on the Barry Jennings thing?
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:59.362]  No, Barry Jennings, who reported bombs going off and dead bodies, the Deputy Emergency Manager there in New York in Building 7, died.
[00:09:59.382 --> 00:10:02.303]  That is confirmed by his boss, by the spokesman.
[00:10:02.723 --> 00:10:06.464]  We put their names in the articles we put out, and people still don't believe it.
[00:10:07.624 --> 00:10:11.745]  But the family will not say why he died, and there's no obituary or no report of it.
[00:10:12.586 --> 00:10:13.686]  And we're trying to investigate it.
[00:10:14.875 --> 00:10:16.616]  Thank you so much, appreciate your call.
[00:10:18.017 --> 00:10:23.281]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mick NPA for Steve Quayle.
[00:10:23.321 --> 00:10:23.921]  Go ahead, Mick.
[00:10:24.982 --> 00:10:37.450]  Oh, first of all, I'd like Mr. Jones and Mr. Quayle, I look, I view you two as gifts from God to His people, and don't think there aren't millions out here who feel the same way.
[00:10:40.513 --> 00:10:43.875]  I would like to ask you, I'm sure you must have researched this at one time or another,
[00:10:44.502 --> 00:11:04.026]  Since God is so much more powerful than Satan, and Revelation says our battle is against the principalities and powers, not the flesh, it might not be a good idea if all your listeners, before and after your program, is one unified voice up to God.
[00:11:04.892 --> 00:11:07.835]  Can we pray for the forces of good and against the forces of evil?
[00:11:25.353 --> 00:11:29.255]  Five million dollar buckets of maggots, literally, from art displays.
[00:11:30.155 --> 00:11:34.917]  Does that need to be protected as well, or do we just pray for the good people?
[00:11:35.458 --> 00:11:36.558]  Steve Quayle comments on that.
[00:11:36.578 --> 00:11:37.819]  Well, I want to share this with you.
[00:11:37.859 --> 00:11:42.041]  The intercessors, and Alex, you have them that pray for you, and I have them that pray for me.
[00:11:42.441 --> 00:11:53.506]  I can tell you this, I specifically, in a time of prayer, the Lord, He said, you cannot stop my judgment upon the country, Steve, but pray for those who have hearing ears and
[00:11:53.979 --> 00:11:54.419]  We're good.
[00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:17.791]  First of all, get right with Jesus.
[00:12:17.851 --> 00:12:20.512]  Repentance is an individual thing, first and foremost.
[00:12:20.793 --> 00:12:25.376]  And then they go to their family level and they work out, but you can't stop what's going to happen.
[00:12:25.816 --> 00:12:29.478]  And I get accused, you'll love this Alex, I get accused of trying to stop all this.
[00:12:29.559 --> 00:12:36.063]  I've said, no, I'm just trying to buy time for as many people to come to the saving knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ and get right with God.
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.101]  And get their family out of harm's way.
[00:12:38.141 --> 00:12:43.926]  It's amazing that our critics must love death because all we're trying to do, Alex, is save people's lives.
[00:12:44.246 --> 00:12:47.329]  Well, you know, there's a lot of people who also cop out.
[00:12:47.989 --> 00:12:48.530]  Right.
[00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:57.436]  And there's a lot of fake Christians in these big $50 million churches with helicopter pads and swimming pools and shopping malls and thumb scanners to get into the church.
[00:12:58.499 --> 00:13:02.102]  They're all running around saying, oh no, we're not supposed to fight evil.
[00:13:02.122 --> 00:13:03.463]  We're not supposed to warn anybody.
[00:13:03.884 --> 00:13:04.624]  Everything's great.
[00:13:04.664 --> 00:13:05.865]  George Bush is of the Lord.
[00:13:05.905 --> 00:13:06.506]  He'll save us.
[00:13:06.526 --> 00:13:07.647]  Sarah Palin will save us.
[00:13:08.047 --> 00:13:12.351]  You know, there's that delusional church lady with the diamonds all over.
[00:13:13.072 --> 00:13:15.273]  And, you know, they're not out warning anybody.
[00:13:15.293 --> 00:13:16.995]  They're not out fighting the abortion clinics.
[00:13:17.355 --> 00:13:23.741]  And the world sees those fake Christians, and then that is a bad testament against them.
[00:13:23.761 --> 00:13:25.042]  And of course, none of that's by mistake.
[00:13:25.467 --> 00:13:33.090]  No, and the deal is, is that Jesus said that God says His name is blasphemed amongst the Gentiles through the people that supposedly believe in Him.
[00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:40.593]  But that doesn't dismiss the fact that He's holy, He's faithful, He's righteous, He's just, and He's given us space to repent.
[00:13:40.633 --> 00:13:42.914]  Now, I want to say something about those churches, Alex.
[00:13:43.474 --> 00:13:52.198]  Those pastors, so many of those pastors, it will not surprise me that they will drop dead in their pulpits, literally, when the events come upon this earth that are coming.
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:59.506]  It will not surprise me when people go up to the pastor and scream, maybe even drag someone from behind the pulpit and say, why did you lie to us?
[00:13:59.546 --> 00:14:03.269]  See, the whole world is seduced, okay?
[00:14:03.589 --> 00:14:06.311]  The whole world is under this power of seduction.
[00:14:06.832 --> 00:14:11.115]  And it's the continual prompting and warning of the watchman, like yourself.
[00:14:11.476 --> 00:14:16.080]  Everybody who's doing it, and I'm not saying we're the only two, I'm just saying we're doing it and others who are doing it.
[00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:18.622]  The bottom line is to make people think, look,
[00:14:19.289 --> 00:14:20.570]  How can you ask God?
[00:14:21.251 --> 00:14:24.434]  I go nuts when I see God bless America, okay?
[00:14:24.915 --> 00:14:30.260]  I say to people, you should put instead of God bless America, God grant America repentance.
[00:14:30.621 --> 00:14:32.883]  Because without repentance there could be no turning of the Lord.
[00:14:32.923 --> 00:14:35.145]  Without any turning of the Lord there could be no restoration.
[00:14:35.446 --> 00:14:36.527]  And I am so sick
[00:14:37.575 --> 00:14:38.555]  Boy, now you got me going.
[00:14:38.855 --> 00:14:55.167]  I am so sick of how dare anybody claim to be a man of the cloth, maybe some cloth, but certainly not holy cloth, and have a $50 million church and still have homeless people, still have people that are absolutely languishing in the ghettos.
[00:14:55.287 --> 00:14:59.149]  I mean, look, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong, and you're right.
[00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:02.872]  What the world sees of biblical Christianity, by design, okay?
[00:15:03.436 --> 00:15:08.418]  Our contemporary Christianity is in no way, in any way, related to Biblical Christianity.
[00:15:08.778 --> 00:15:12.620]  So what they're doing, the Illuminati, is getting people to blame the Christians.
[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:13.900]  You just made the analogy.
[00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:15.501]  Neuro-linguistic programming.
[00:15:15.541 --> 00:15:17.922]  George Bush is a Christian, so he claims.
[00:15:18.002 --> 00:15:18.502]  No, he isn't.
[00:15:18.802 --> 00:15:20.863]  He's no longer talking about Jesus.
[00:15:20.903 --> 00:15:25.065]  Jesus said, if you don't confess me before men, I won't confess you before my Father which is in Heaven.
[00:15:25.529 --> 00:15:31.375]  The church ladies with the lipstick and the diamond rings and all that stuff, it's irrelevant.
[00:15:31.435 --> 00:15:42.467]  But what is relevant is that the world sees somebody who's starting war, who's doing all these things, and it's the perfect, perfect introduction of the destruction of the world view.
[00:15:42.667 --> 00:15:43.528]  Yeah, on a mercy level.
[00:15:49.516 --> 00:15:52.537]  They've corrupted our government, obviously, with money.
[00:15:52.718 --> 00:15:56.859]  They've got something they hold over the head of all these corrupt congressmen.
[00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:08.384]  I'm sure many congressmen don't even want to go along with this, but they feel like they have to, or they'll be toppled by the media and the forces of evil behind the media.
[00:16:09.005 --> 00:16:14.667]  What do you think of the idea of congresses could somehow engineer a short period of atonement
[00:16:15.154 --> 00:16:16.316]  We're all congressmen.
[00:16:31.681 --> 00:16:39.146]  I'd say to Congress, okay, whatever your sins are in the past, come up, confess them, you're forgiven, and then get to the forces behind them.
[00:16:39.166 --> 00:16:41.428]  Yeah, but the corporate media wouldn't allow that.
[00:16:41.948 --> 00:16:44.290]  They're not going to stop the demonization.
[00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:45.631]  I appreciate your call.
[00:16:46.552 --> 00:16:56.779]  But I do agree, when some congressman's been doing good stuff and fighting the New World Order, there's not many of them, and then they take something and magnify it and make a crooked toenail a big deal, people should reject that.
[00:16:57.278 --> 00:17:11.049]  Well they should, and look at Alex, all of our efforts to, you know, back and support Ron Paul and stuff, but the bottom line is, with all our efforts, still it was the mediification, that's the media and vilification combined, the mediification
[00:17:11.602 --> 00:17:12.002]  Absolutely.
[00:17:12.042 --> 00:17:13.903]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[00:17:13.923 --> 00:17:14.404]  Thank you, Mick.
[00:17:14.424 --> 00:17:15.544]  Dave in Colorado, you're on the air.
[00:17:15.564 --> 00:17:17.105]  Dave in Colorado, you are on the air.
[00:17:40.006 --> 00:17:44.127]  I said thank you for taking the time to speak with me.
[00:17:44.147 --> 00:17:45.447]  Do you know U. Chris Mollis?
[00:17:45.467 --> 00:17:46.188]  Have you ever heard of him?
[00:17:59.096 --> 00:18:00.617]  Yes, I've interviewed Eustace Mullins.
[00:18:00.657 --> 00:18:06.702]  He wrote, I believe, Secrets of the Federal Reserve about 40, 50 years ago, and he's very elderly now.
[00:18:06.722 --> 00:18:13.808]  Yeah, he was in an assisted living home, and he was kidnapped.
[00:18:15.269 --> 00:18:28.079]  And I heard Jack McClan talking about it the other night, and the witness had seen the person who took him out of the home was
[00:18:29.201 --> 00:18:33.604]  They said he looked like a hillbilly that just walked out of the Ozarks.
[00:18:34.625 --> 00:18:35.085]  I don't understand.
[00:18:35.105 --> 00:18:36.806]  Yeah, I don't know about that either, Alex.
[00:18:36.886 --> 00:18:38.267]  Yeah, I'll have to call him.
[00:18:38.487 --> 00:18:42.490]  And it's also hard to talk to listeners when the radios are jacked up in the background.
[00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:47.253]  I don't mean to be mean, but I can barely understand what you're saying because you've got the radio turned up, listeners.
[00:18:47.673 --> 00:18:51.876]  And once you're on the show with us, you can't really talk and listen to it.
[00:18:53.377 --> 00:18:56.059]  I know that he's been in and out of nursing homes and on health problems.
[00:18:56.099 --> 00:18:57.720]  Last time I interviewed him was about two years ago.
[00:18:59.275 --> 00:19:00.896]  I know folks are having trouble getting in touch with him.
[00:19:00.936 --> 00:19:01.957]  I'll call Jack McClam.
[00:19:01.977 --> 00:19:05.579]  In fact, before I forget, will you go try to call Jack McClam with the bottom of it?
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.420]  We need to get Jack McClam on anyways.
[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:08.941]  All this police state stuff happening.
[00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:10.823]  So let's get Jack McClam on.
[00:19:10.863 --> 00:19:12.704]  That's a good reminder to have him on.
[00:19:13.504 --> 00:19:14.825]  But we'll try to look into that.
[00:19:14.885 --> 00:19:16.046]  Thank you for the heads up, Dave.
[00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:18.067]  Tim in Georgia.
[00:19:18.107 --> 00:19:19.408]  You're on the air with Steve Quayle.
[00:19:19.448 --> 00:19:19.988]  Go ahead, Tim.
[00:19:20.689 --> 00:19:21.969]  Hey, Alex.
[00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:26.012]  You looked at the text of the bill before Congress, I guess?
[00:19:26.332 --> 00:19:27.513]  The bailout bill?
[00:19:28.792 --> 00:19:34.756]  Yes, I've scanned over it and seen the analysis of it, and it basically says they'll fund any foreign banks, loot whoever they want.
[00:19:35.196 --> 00:19:41.720]  It gives total anonymity and liability protection, a pardon to all the criminals that have done it, to Paulson.
[00:19:43.453 --> 00:19:45.576]  Listen to this, this is Section 8, word for word.
[00:19:45.917 --> 00:19:57.335]  Decisions by the Secretary pursuant to the authority of this Act are non-reviewable and committed to agency discretion and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency.
[00:19:57.715 --> 00:19:58.757]  That's the text of it.
[00:19:58.957 --> 00:20:09.342]  Yeah, they're giving themselves total liability protection to rob and steal and do whatever they want, and Congress is signing over its authority.
[00:20:09.802 --> 00:20:17.026]  That is a martial law declaration, because the Treasury, and with the Federal Reserve, literally dominates the entire government.
[00:20:17.646 --> 00:20:20.108]  And they're just admitting that in the mainstream news.
[00:20:20.149 --> 00:20:21.149]  That has been reported.
[00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:24.513]  Bloomberg says the President is now a dictator under that.
[00:20:25.133 --> 00:20:26.815]  And Congress has not passed that yet.
[00:20:26.835 --> 00:20:30.458]  We need a story ourselves on Infowars.com or PrisonPlan.
[00:20:30.478 --> 00:20:31.699]  I know Kurt did a good one today.
[00:20:31.719 --> 00:20:32.600]  We need one about this.
[00:20:33.721 --> 00:20:36.404]  I've got it here, but give folks the subsection again.
[00:20:36.884 --> 00:20:38.426]  Is that the House or the Senate version?
[00:20:39.931 --> 00:20:40.991]  I don't know which one.
[00:20:41.011 --> 00:20:42.252]  I'll have to scroll up and look.
[00:20:42.452 --> 00:20:44.953]  This is the one that was sent to Congress late yesterday.
[00:20:44.973 --> 00:20:46.514]  Yeah, Sunday it was written up in secret.
[00:20:46.534 --> 00:20:47.935]  Do you have the bill number?
[00:20:47.955 --> 00:20:48.696]  I've got it in articles.
[00:20:48.716 --> 00:20:50.737]  I can dig it out, but if you've got it, it would really help.
[00:21:01.971 --> 00:21:02.891]  The bill number?
[00:21:03.071 --> 00:21:04.612]  No, it's not listed there.
[00:21:04.632 --> 00:21:09.773]  It just says, Legislative Proposal for Treasury Authority to Purchase Mortgage-Related Assets.
[00:21:10.213 --> 00:21:15.534]  Yeah, that would be the one they're wanting Congress to introduce, but you're going to find Congressmen have introduced that.
[00:21:15.554 --> 00:21:19.075]  We need to find the copy of who's introduced it, and then what section is that?
[00:21:19.095 --> 00:21:24.316]  It doesn't... No, no, you read the section.
[00:21:24.376 --> 00:21:25.177]  You read it.
[00:21:25.237 --> 00:21:26.097]  I think it's Section 8.
[00:21:26.757 --> 00:21:27.017]  Yeah.
[00:21:27.317 --> 00:21:28.898]  Jay, can you do that for me?
[00:21:28.918 --> 00:21:30.318]  Can you just look at it and tell me the section?
[00:21:31.204 --> 00:21:32.565]  It's insane what you just announced.
[00:21:32.585 --> 00:21:38.051]  It's a dictatorial takeover of all the finances of the country, and there is no oversight, there is no accountability.
[00:21:52.478 --> 00:21:54.461]  This is absolutely the end.
[00:21:54.501 --> 00:22:03.335]  We should play The Doors, the end at this point, because if people don't understand, this is a power play, and if you wanted to engineer a power play...
[00:22:03.757 --> 00:22:05.938]  You'd put a set of circumstances, would you not, Alex?
[00:22:05.958 --> 00:22:06.218]  That's right.
[00:22:06.258 --> 00:22:24.868]  You issue the credit, you rope the people in, you tell them to do it, you make them think it's their fault, you tie them in, then you give all these private banks absolute dictatorial control over the nation to steal, to do whatever they want, in any way, and give them total liability, protection from any criminal or civil prosecution.
[00:22:25.069 --> 00:22:27.330]  They've committed all these crimes, they've told you on the news,
[00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:31.731]  Nobody's going to be investigated because this is all engineered and by design.
[00:22:32.031 --> 00:22:32.812]  In fact, cue up!
[00:22:32.852 --> 00:22:33.512]  This is the end.
[00:22:33.532 --> 00:22:38.613]  We're going to skip this break as well for InfoWars.com listeners and PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:22:38.934 --> 00:22:40.574]  But for everybody else, we'll be back in three minutes.
[00:22:41.094 --> 00:22:41.774]  Great point.
[00:22:41.814 --> 00:22:42.875]  You know, that's in the news.
[00:22:44.082 --> 00:22:52.366]  And now such earth-shattering things are happening every day, I'm just like, oh yeah, they have liability protection and no one can challenge them, and Congress is signing over its authority.
[00:22:52.706 --> 00:22:56.668]  That's admitted to be in there, and the caller did the research and called in with a section.
[00:22:57.188 --> 00:23:02.470]  I mean, that's how used to corruption we've gotten to where we just now pretty much just accept it.
[00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:04.271]  Here we go with Steve Quayle.
[00:23:06.725 --> 00:23:31.380]  You know, Steve, that's a key point, is that we've just gotten to the point now where, you know, that's been in the news since last Saturday, then Sunday, that they're going to give themselves total liability protection from all their crimes, and that I don't even hardly mention it on air, because I'm so punch-drunk from the corruption, where we just live with it so much, and then know that now everything we've said is coming true, and we're not even tooting our own horn saying, look, we were right.
[00:23:31.901 --> 00:23:35.363]  We're just kind of like, because it's one thing to know it's coming, it's another thing to see it.
[00:23:37.515 --> 00:23:38.315]  Steve, your comments?
[00:23:38.696 --> 00:23:39.956]  It's being implemented, Alex.
[00:23:40.016 --> 00:23:42.798]  I mean, this is the end of all financial freedom.
[00:23:43.158 --> 00:23:53.042]  Remember, ladies and gentlemen, now, under the same law, or under the same bill, or a previous bill, every single credit card purchase is going to be made available to the IRS.
[00:23:53.403 --> 00:23:58.925]  Every single eBay purchase is going to be made available to the IRS, both sales and purchases.
[00:23:59.466 --> 00:24:00.626]  Every single thing.
[00:24:00.926 --> 00:24:06.349]  One of the secret weapons that Woodward was talking about, Alex, is they have the ability now with a specific
[00:24:07.236 --> 00:24:07.717]  I don't
[00:24:25.228 --> 00:24:27.789]  A guy that wrote the book, The Secret Man, Frank Dukes.
[00:24:27.849 --> 00:24:43.735]  No, no, I remember you years ago saying that they have thermal imaging biometrics where they can kill somebody out of a crowd and now they have satellites that can tell your biometric shadow integrated with your walk, your gait, in a crowd so they can target you and kill you.
[00:24:44.396 --> 00:24:45.016]  Absolutely.
[00:24:45.356 --> 00:24:47.977]  And see, the point, all that stuff is good.
[00:24:48.379 --> 00:24:54.343]  But everything that they have, it should be followed up with a statement that they can target you and kill you.
[00:24:54.783 --> 00:24:55.944]  That's right.
[00:24:56.044 --> 00:24:58.225]  What can it be used for, for evil aims?
[00:24:58.485 --> 00:24:59.026]  You got it.
[00:24:59.346 --> 00:25:05.610]  And there is no, and this is the thing that people have got to understand, there is no redemptive purpose in it.
[00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:12.034]  And they can say, well, it can find breast tumors, you know, they have that equipment already.
[00:25:12.094 --> 00:25:13.354]  But we're not going to get that in.
[00:25:13.595 --> 00:25:17.417]  Yeah, but the point is, is that all of this stuff is pointing to this.
[00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:24.876]  Is that, look, if you control an entire person's well-being, it's like the food situation, Alex.
[00:25:25.216 --> 00:25:28.038]  The UN wants everybody to live on 1200 calories a day.
[00:25:28.139 --> 00:25:29.740]  So what do they show throughout the world?
[00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:36.886]  They show fat Americans, obese Americans, and basically saying, these people are borrowing all our money to sit and watch TV and get fat.
[00:25:37.166 --> 00:25:38.327]  That's it in a nutshell.
[00:25:38.647 --> 00:25:45.913]  So again, every single view, every single perception, every single image that's shown to the world is in a worse
[00:25:47.133 --> 00:25:47.653]  This is the end, yeah
[00:26:18.723 --> 00:26:20.824]  At least of this phase of the Ponzi scheme.
[00:26:22.805 --> 00:26:24.146]  This is the end.
[00:26:25.766 --> 00:26:29.408]  My only friend, the end.
[00:26:31.029 --> 00:26:35.171]  Of our elaborate plans, the end.
[00:26:41.315 --> 00:26:42.336]  No safety.
[00:26:42.356 --> 00:26:47.960]  I'll never... Won't you picture what will be?
[00:27:11.918 --> 00:27:19.625]  Steve Quayle's our guest.
[00:27:19.665 --> 00:27:20.646]  Taking your phone calls.
[00:27:20.966 --> 00:27:21.907]  I googled 2008 bailout.
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:24.980]  Or, Bailout 2008.
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:30.843]  One of the top links, Dirty Secrets of the Bailout, 32 words that none dare utter.
[00:27:30.863 --> 00:27:35.025]  And this is from the Huffington Post, and rightfully so, it's gotten 5,000 digs.
[00:27:35.365 --> 00:27:38.227]  We'll get it up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:27:38.367 --> 00:27:40.868]  I'm sure it'll be up at Steve Quayle's website as well.
[00:27:41.908 --> 00:27:44.390]  Because it gives you the bill.
[00:27:45.410 --> 00:28:01.838]  I did link through, the bill is there, and it is, decisions by the Secretary pursuant to the authority of this Act are non-reviewable, can't even review them, forgive me, you know, and committed to agency discretion, and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency.
[00:28:02.878 --> 00:28:08.761]  And Congress is going to sign this blank check over, which they don't even have the authority to do, this is mass treason.
[00:28:08.781 --> 00:28:12.023]  It'd be one thing if they said, here's a trillion bucks, but we're going to have oversight.
[00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:16.013]  But see, notice Bush says, with PDD 51, they have no oversight.
[00:28:17.134 --> 00:28:19.315]  So it's all just criminal, rogue government.
[00:28:19.836 --> 00:28:25.260]  And we will get this up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com ASAP.
[00:28:25.981 --> 00:28:32.246]  Okay, but the headline is, Dirty secret of the bailout, 32 words that none dare utter.
[00:28:32.907 --> 00:28:34.768]  Huffington Post by Jason Lincolns.
[00:28:34.808 --> 00:28:35.749]  Good job, Jason.
[00:28:36.349 --> 00:28:38.771]  And by the way, that came out last night.
[00:28:39.272 --> 00:28:41.734]  Okay, Steve, finishing up on that.
[00:28:42.881 --> 00:28:44.142]  I think it's obvious now.
[00:28:44.262 --> 00:28:47.344]  It's in our total, total face.
[00:28:47.885 --> 00:29:01.715]  And if anybody can put this into perspective, I'm told by people in that level of banking over the weekend, how heated the discussions have been, how absolutely threatened the international bank community is.
[00:29:01.775 --> 00:29:09.441]  By the way, Alex, even certain factions of the Illuminati, the ones that were told it would work out different now are starting to get furious.
[00:29:09.501 --> 00:29:10.182]  I use that word.
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:16.022]  And so the thing is, is that... Yeah, there's a lot of suckers in the mid-strata who've been believing the Kool-Aid.
[00:29:16.563 --> 00:29:17.383]  Absolutely.
[00:29:17.743 --> 00:29:21.705]  But what people don't understand is simply this.
[00:29:22.285 --> 00:29:29.909]  It's now a question you've got to do, you've got to basically prepare for the absolute worst, okay?
[00:29:30.709 --> 00:29:33.390]  And that's where we're at right now.
[00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:36.071]  They have to prepare for the absolute worst.
[00:29:36.692 --> 00:29:39.593]  And again, they have to be practical, they have to be tactical.
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:47.244]  And we're at the point in time, Alex, where there's no room for dilly-dallying any longer.
[00:29:47.624 --> 00:29:55.268]  If people want to continue to listen to you, or me, for entertainment, well, they'll listen to you, they won't listen to me, because I won't be there, and I'm not going to be there.
[00:29:55.308 --> 00:30:04.033]  The point is that they have to realize that what we've warned them about food, about the nuclear, biological, chem, the necessity to prepare, all these things are critical.
[00:30:04.553 --> 00:30:05.954]  All these things are critical.
[00:30:07.795 --> 00:30:09.496]  Sometimes I'm at a loss for words, because
[00:30:09.904 --> 00:30:12.665]  I know how to say it, but I don't want to say it with a word.
[00:30:12.705 --> 00:30:28.330]  Well no, it's also that you don't, it's hard to, we've intellectually known all this was being set up, but to see them do it, and to keep seeing them do everything they say they do, we know now they're going to do the other things they said, which includes killing more than 80% of us, and that's on record.
[00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:32.231]  And I just feel sorry for all of you that served the system and laughed and giggled and
[00:30:33.682 --> 00:30:37.966]  My detractors all still laughing, giggling, saying the dollar's not devalued, the economy's not in trouble.
[00:30:39.208 --> 00:30:40.269]  Steve, we'll do five more minutes.
[00:30:40.329 --> 00:30:41.289]  Back in 70 seconds.
[00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:42.891]  We're going into the final hour right now.
[00:30:43.191 --> 00:30:44.813]  Take a few final calls for Steve Quayle.
[00:30:44.833 --> 00:30:45.353]  Stay with us.
[00:30:48.416 --> 00:30:49.958]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:31:06.595 --> 00:31:07.995]  America, freedom to fascism.

[00:31:59.112 --> 00:32:01.013]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:32:01.473 --> 00:32:04.254]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:16.010]  Look, it's simple.
[00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:20.413]  The global tyrants had to destroy the United States, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, the Second Amendment.
[00:32:21.153 --> 00:32:27.476]  The Internet that they had dubbed the worldwide wiretap to control and regulate and track our every movement has been turned against them.
[00:32:28.297 --> 00:32:30.398]  Double-edged sword cuts both ways.
[00:32:32.379 --> 00:32:37.482]  They're going to lose if they continue to allow us to be above ground and to be operating against their enemy operation.
[00:32:37.942 --> 00:32:40.643]  Enemies of life, enemies of decency, enemies of honor.
[00:32:40.663 --> 00:32:43.625]  It's the forces of evil peopling every agency, every government,
[00:32:44.918 --> 00:32:47.300]  Every society versus the forces of good.
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:48.141]  We also people.
[00:32:48.461 --> 00:32:50.703]  Every government, every agency, every society.
[00:32:51.784 --> 00:32:54.426]  And all of you have to shine now against this tyranny like never before.
[00:32:54.766 --> 00:32:57.308]  Steve Quayle says he is bugging out and getting out of things.
[00:32:58.029 --> 00:33:00.030]  And I know he's taking multi-year hiatuses.
[00:33:00.871 --> 00:33:02.893]  Six months of hiatus as before, but he says this is it.
[00:33:02.933 --> 00:33:03.753]  He's really out of there.
[00:33:04.694 --> 00:33:08.596]  He's done so much work, but his website will still stand as a testament to all the work and research.
[00:33:08.636 --> 00:33:11.839]  A lot of shocking stuff that just kept coming true over the years.
[00:33:12.679 --> 00:33:13.420]  Really amazing.
[00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:17.723]  Before he leaves us here in just a few minutes, I don't want to keep him too much longer, I've got some other news we're going to be covering.
[00:33:18.363 --> 00:33:19.664]  We'll give out his website for you.
[00:33:20.404 --> 00:33:22.426]  But who have we gotten up to here in the calls?
[00:33:22.486 --> 00:33:26.889]  I've got Mark, Steve, Phillip, Matty, Bill, Tim.
[00:33:26.909 --> 00:33:27.349]  Mark's next.
[00:33:27.669 --> 00:33:28.450]  Mark in Oregon.
[00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:29.090]  You're on the air.
[00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:29.491]  Go ahead.
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:32.341]  Hey, good morning, Alex and Steve.
[00:33:32.381 --> 00:33:35.802]  Thank you both for your great service to God and country through the years here.
[00:33:36.662 --> 00:33:54.669]  I want to ask you, Steve, you know, you have spoken and enlightened us all to the Hedron Collider and what it's truly being used for at its largest purpose, which is to open up, I assume, a very large gateway to a dimension which will allow
[00:33:56.568 --> 00:33:57.809]  Well, I mean, here's the deal.
[00:33:57.829 --> 00:34:01.411]  We don't know what it does, but they admit it can open up to other dimensions.
[00:34:02.112 --> 00:34:03.272]  And that's what they say.
[00:34:03.733 --> 00:34:16.722]  Then they laugh at the public and say, oh, there's no problem, while the makers of it admit that it can create black holes, strangelets, particles that will absorb the Earth over time, a cocktail of things, and they're going to be doing thousands of experiments.
[00:34:16.742 --> 00:34:22.265]  So there's a low probability each test, but with all the other experiments, with what they admit, that's when it becomes dangerous.
[00:34:22.285 --> 00:34:22.706]  But go ahead.
[00:34:23.194 --> 00:34:42.881]  Yes, Alex, and Steve has said in other venues in recent times that actually there will be demonic entities, other entities of hell, which come through this Stargate or Gateway or Black Hole, however one would want to term it.
[00:34:43.482 --> 00:34:52.445]  And what I'm most curious about, and I think it would be very helpful knowledge to us all, is what Steve may know, what Steve may extrapolate,
[00:34:53.055 --> 00:35:06.583]  Visualize, be inspired to actually realize up to this point in time how these creatures that are being let through here into our dimension, into our physical world, are going to appear personally.
[00:35:06.663 --> 00:35:10.425]  Well, see, I don't want to... Listen, I don't do a lot of speculating here on the show.
[00:35:11.164 --> 00:35:36.962]  And the scientists and physicists have said it could open other dimensions, they don't know what's in them, all sorts of things, and you know, black holes and atomic reactions, things like that, and that's really, you know... Right, Alex, what the caller's referring to though, let me share this, and I won't speculate either, what he's referring to is information I've passed about, given to me by people in the world of special operations that deal with this stuff, but let me just say this, whatever it is,
[00:35:37.501 --> 00:35:42.142]  If they're worshipping the Goddess of Destruction, it's not going to be good for us, okay?
[00:35:42.702 --> 00:35:47.644]  And the thing is, is that I just want to commend my listener that he's obviously listened intently.
[00:35:48.304 --> 00:35:52.865]  For everybody that wants to know about this stuff, I can't wait to get a book published.
[00:35:52.885 --> 00:35:55.425]  I'm not pitching a book, but I put everything I know about it.
[00:35:55.445 --> 00:35:56.406]  Oh, I want you to pitch a book.
[00:35:56.426 --> 00:35:58.266]  You've got a lot of great books and materials.
[00:35:58.286 --> 00:36:01.387]  Well, the one book I'm going to pitch, excuse me, it's at the printer.
[00:36:01.894 --> 00:36:05.137]  The cover designs being done right now is called Long Walkers.
[00:36:05.377 --> 00:36:07.498]  L-O-N-G-W-A-L-K-E-R-S.
[00:36:07.859 --> 00:36:14.064]  That's a special operations command name for the things that they deal with that are of giant stature.
[00:36:14.784 --> 00:36:17.066]  Long Walkers, the return of the Nephilim.
[00:36:17.126 --> 00:36:21.369]  So, to the caller and to others, I am, you know, anxious.
[00:36:21.429 --> 00:36:25.132]  I'm like a dog with a new piece of big meaty bone.
[00:36:25.212 --> 00:36:28.235]  I want to get that thing out because what I did incorporate it into
[00:36:28.917 --> 00:36:32.719]  A fictional novel, the actual stuff I know is integrated in the novel.
[00:36:32.759 --> 00:36:35.020]  Okay, fire out the website and the phone number.
[00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:41.004]  Yeah, it's stevequayle.com, stevequayle, q-u-a-y-l-e dot com, phone numbers 406-586-4840, 406-586-4840.
[00:36:41.044 --> 00:36:43.165]  Alright, give that number out again.
[00:36:43.185 --> 00:36:43.225]  406-586-4840.
[00:36:53.134 --> 00:36:57.678]  Alright, I'm going to say bye to Steve here for folks watching at PrisonPlanet.tv and on the internet.
[00:36:57.698 --> 00:36:59.739]  For everybody else, we'll be right back with more of your calls.
[00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:00.880]  Stay with us.
[00:37:05.804 --> 00:37:10.108]  Okay Steve, well that was an amazing interview and your stuff on the internet.
[00:37:10.368 --> 00:37:13.390]  Alright, give that number out again.
[00:37:20.691 --> 00:37:21.111]  4-0-6-5-8-6-4-8-4-0.
[00:37:21.131 --> 00:37:29.898]  Alright, I'm going to say bye to Steve here for folks watching at PrisonPlanet.tv and on the internet.
[00:37:29.918 --> 00:37:31.980]  For everybody else, we'll be right back with more of your calls.
[00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:37.464]  Stay with us.
[00:37:38.685 --> 00:37:46.251]  ...a day unlike any other in the long course of American history... ...because again, I've made the... if we're on air, I want people to know, I will post
[00:37:46.821 --> 00:37:56.869]  Anything I know on my website, as long as the internet stays up, and I've made, what would you say, I've got an ability to broadcast on pirate radio to warn people.
[00:37:56.909 --> 00:38:02.174]  So, you know, if you'll do this, Alex, if you will get someone, Trey or somebody, to send me an email of your personal email.
[00:38:02.194 --> 00:38:04.275]  No, I know it usually takes you a week to get a hold of me, and I apologize.
[00:38:04.556 --> 00:38:07.978]  You've got my cell phone, I've just gotten to where I don't use it anymore because it fries my brain.
[00:38:08.239 --> 00:38:13.403]  Yeah, no, no, no, no, just, you know, do you take email at producer at InfoWars.com?
[00:38:14.724 --> 00:38:16.846]  Yeah, that's one, but it gets filled up with stuff, too.
[00:38:19.068 --> 00:38:19.748]  I've got a few.
[00:38:19.768 --> 00:38:25.233]  The best thing to do is to cc Aaron at Infowars.com, because I read that and so does Aaron.
[00:38:25.573 --> 00:38:26.834]  There's just so much spam.
[00:38:27.235 --> 00:38:27.815]  Right, I understand.
[00:38:27.875 --> 00:38:29.216]  Is it Aaron with two A's?
[00:38:29.256 --> 00:38:29.697]  Yes, sir.
[00:38:30.217 --> 00:38:35.882]  Okay, I'll do that, because again, what I want, ladies and gentlemen, I want all of you to keep Alex in prayer.
[00:38:36.302 --> 00:38:37.603]  Intercessors, keep him in prayer.
[00:38:37.623 --> 00:38:38.564]  He's on the front line.
[00:38:38.965 --> 00:38:40.466]  And ladies and gentlemen, again,
[00:38:41.038 --> 00:38:41.358]  Do.
[00:38:41.758 --> 00:38:42.039]  Do.
[00:38:42.479 --> 00:38:42.779]  Do.
[00:38:43.199 --> 00:38:48.723]  Put into effect all the recommendations that you've heard on Alex's show, through all the guests, because we're there.
[00:38:48.843 --> 00:38:50.243]  It's no longer warning, Alex.
[00:38:50.263 --> 00:38:50.864]  It's implementation.
[00:38:50.984 --> 00:38:51.424]  I hear you.
[00:38:51.724 --> 00:38:52.125]  I hear you.
[00:38:52.145 --> 00:38:54.426]  Steve Quayle, thanks for spending time with us today.
[00:38:54.726 --> 00:38:55.066]  Thank you.
[00:38:55.106 --> 00:38:55.406]  Bye-bye.
[00:38:56.067 --> 00:38:57.268]  All right, there goes Steve Quayle.
[00:38:57.428 --> 00:39:05.873]  And you know, Steve, it's in the economy, he gets into bioweapons, he gets into so much that's documented and provable, and the fact that the Hedrick Lauder can go into other dimensions.
[00:39:06.773 --> 00:39:07.474]  That's been reported.
[00:39:07.514 --> 00:39:08.995]  We don't know what's in those dimensions.
[00:39:10.276 --> 00:39:13.880]  He gets into a lot of really sexy stuff as they call it.
[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:19.064]  I tend to stick to some of the things that I can prove a little bit more inside the box.
[00:39:19.745 --> 00:39:24.930]  But we bring Gaston like Steve because he's a really good guy and he believes what he's saying and a lot of what he's talked about
[00:39:26.522 --> 00:39:37.959]  Unfortunately, it has come true over the years, and that's basically where I will leave that, but it's up to you to research it all for yourself.
[00:39:38.059 --> 00:39:41.764]  Also, I believe Steve believes what he's saying, but as Bill Cooper said,
[00:39:42.245 --> 00:39:52.978]  He was brought into army intelligence and they told him UFOs were real and it was all government operations and they were in league with them and then later he thought they'd given him disinfo to then go out and tell others about it.
[00:39:53.338 --> 00:39:57.103]  So we know that's also part of the disinformation system of the New World Order.
[00:39:57.663 --> 00:39:59.524]  Is to go out and put this information out.
[00:39:59.824 --> 00:40:01.405]  So that's why I stick to what we can prove.
[00:40:01.685 --> 00:40:04.867]  Particle beams, a lot of this stuff we know is there.
[00:40:05.347 --> 00:40:09.669]  We talked about the infrared, knowing somebody's heat signature in a crowd to be able to kill them.
[00:40:09.889 --> 00:40:13.791]  Their shadow from satellites that have a global hawk launch a missile at them.
[00:40:13.811 --> 00:40:14.832]  That's all real and true.
[00:40:15.092 --> 00:40:16.312]  Here we go back into the main show.
[00:40:28.777 --> 00:40:29.138]  All right.
[00:40:29.338 --> 00:40:31.561]  Very interesting discussion with Steve Quayle.
[00:40:32.482 --> 00:40:34.204]  About 95% of that can be documented.
[00:40:34.224 --> 00:40:35.626]  The other 5% is pretty wild.
[00:40:36.166 --> 00:40:37.127]  God knows what's true.
[00:40:37.768 --> 00:40:44.536]  But we'll continue to cover it all and bring you all the interesting people that are thought-provoking here.
[00:40:45.916 --> 00:40:48.399]  What I do know is that a listener is absolutely right.
[00:40:48.439 --> 00:40:59.751]  I'd seen all the blurbs and the articles and read that there was amnesty for all the crooks and a pardon for them and that it gave dictatorial power to the Treasury and to the President and quote, got rid of checks and balances.
[00:41:01.112 --> 00:41:04.676]  And I'd seen earlier bailout bills they brought forward, but I hadn't seen this.
[00:41:04.736 --> 00:41:05.917]  I've now been on the bill.
[00:41:07.085 --> 00:41:13.454]  It says decisions by the Secretary pursuant to the authority of the Act are non-reversible, non-renewable, reviewable.
[00:41:14.154 --> 00:41:16.217]  That word is so evil I can't even pronounce it right.
[00:41:16.718 --> 00:41:20.463]  Decisions by the Secretary pursuant to the authority of this Act are non-reversible,
[00:41:21.877 --> 00:41:22.478]  Reviewable.
[00:41:22.558 --> 00:41:23.900]  No one can look at it even.
[00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:25.382]  Can't even talk about it.
[00:41:25.903 --> 00:41:27.485]  And committed to agency direction.
[00:41:28.206 --> 00:41:32.372]  And may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency.
[00:41:33.032 --> 00:41:34.114]  That's this part right here.
[00:41:34.535 --> 00:41:36.157]  And you can go down here and click through.
[00:41:39.321 --> 00:41:40.783]  Read deeper into it.
[00:41:40.803 --> 00:41:43.766]  You can also read the McClatchy newspaper saying the same thing about it.
[00:41:44.627 --> 00:41:48.992]  You can read the Wall Street Journal talking about it, the New York Times talking about it.
[00:41:49.672 --> 00:41:54.337]  You can go to the bill itself right here.
[00:41:58.086 --> 00:41:59.787]  There is just so much in this.
[00:42:00.067 --> 00:42:01.027]  It's just amazing.
[00:42:01.387 --> 00:42:04.929]  We need to get our own stories up on the site that integrate in, that they're bringing in the military.
[00:42:05.409 --> 00:42:14.393]  We haven't even done a story yet about how last week the Army Times reported, hey, full brigades of the Army are going to patrol America for riots and civil insurrection.
[00:42:14.693 --> 00:42:16.794]  I mean, what are... Regular Army.
[00:42:17.215 --> 00:42:18.435]  We always told you this.
[00:42:18.955 --> 00:42:22.357]  We always told you NORTHCOM would be the instrument, but now it's happening.
[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:29.843]  You know, I don't know about particle beams and stargates or antimatter bombs, though the military admits they've been working on those.
[00:42:30.624 --> 00:42:33.565]  All I know is this stuff's real and this is happening.
[00:42:34.125 --> 00:42:39.708]  And this is no longer in the realm of speculation or fiction here.
[00:42:40.589 --> 00:42:44.431]  This is the balloon going up and this is hardcore serious.
[00:42:45.731 --> 00:42:54.116]  I'm going to take a few final calls, and I've got some clips I'm going to play from a Donahue program back in 94.
[00:42:54.416 --> 00:42:56.738]  Yesterday I played the first couple segments.
[00:42:58.639 --> 00:43:00.980]  Well, I'm going to preface those when we go to them here in a minute.
[00:43:01.901 --> 00:43:04.863]  But right now, let's go ahead and take a few more calls.
[00:43:06.524 --> 00:43:07.384]  Who's up next, John?
[00:43:07.404 --> 00:43:09.586]  Stephen Utah.
[00:43:09.626 --> 00:43:10.686]  Yeah, Stephen Utah.
[00:43:11.067 --> 00:43:12.447]  You're on the air, Steve, go ahead.
[00:43:12.467 --> 00:43:13.828]  Hello.
[00:43:14.128 --> 00:43:14.669]  Hi, go ahead.
[00:43:16.206 --> 00:43:20.149]  Yeah, I've been talking and trying to get this information out there.
[00:43:20.969 --> 00:43:32.717]  When I talk about the economy, I'm told that we almost lost everything, and it's a good thing that the government's bailing out these banks.
[00:43:32.817 --> 00:43:34.578]  It's helping us.
[00:43:35.218 --> 00:43:37.300]  And then also, this is just a cycle.
[00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:39.901]  And the combat brigades are coming to save us.
[00:43:40.762 --> 00:43:44.004]  Yeah, well, just with the economy,
[00:43:44.693 --> 00:43:49.577]  The bailout by the banks, this is a cycle, this is a good thing.
[00:43:49.597 --> 00:43:53.320]  Oh, it's a good thing, that's good!
[00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:59.244]  Not only did they say it would never happen and it was all conspiracy theories, but now it's a good thing.
[00:43:59.825 --> 00:44:01.186]  Yeah, it's a good thing.
[00:44:01.586 --> 00:44:08.812]  And another thing with what you guessed this afternoon, we've been, you know, we've been
[00:44:10.384 --> 00:44:15.625]  It's pretty much taught that wrong is right, and it's pretty much the norm.
[00:44:15.645 --> 00:44:19.466]  It's illegal to smoke marijuana, but it's not illegal to abort babies.
[00:44:19.646 --> 00:44:20.166]  That's right.
[00:44:21.346 --> 00:44:24.627]  It's kind of confusing.
[00:44:24.907 --> 00:44:31.388]  Oh no, abortion is a precious right, and getting sterilized is sexy and cool, like the news is reporting.
[00:44:31.408 --> 00:44:32.929]  I'm going to cover that before the show ends.
[00:44:33.489 --> 00:44:35.109]  I hear you, it's good to talk to you.
[00:44:35.729 --> 00:44:38.190]  Steve, Philip in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:44:40.359 --> 00:44:40.599]  Yeah.
[00:44:40.619 --> 00:44:41.660]  Can you hear me?
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:42.440]  Yes, I can.
[00:44:43.221 --> 00:44:43.561]  Okay.
[00:44:44.061 --> 00:44:45.002]  You have to excuse me.
[00:44:45.042 --> 00:44:45.902]  I've got this allergy.
[00:44:46.482 --> 00:44:47.223]  That's all right, sir.
[00:44:47.263 --> 00:44:47.763]  Go ahead.
[00:44:48.503 --> 00:44:48.844]  Okay.
[00:44:49.024 --> 00:44:58.529]  I heard the woman call in earlier, and she was talking about she moved from where she was to somewhere else, and I heard the same thing.
[00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:01.110]  It was some years ago.
[00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:06.353]  I kept hearing the gathering in my mind for two weeks, like a song you couldn't get rid of.
[00:45:07.387 --> 00:45:12.408]  And I turned on the radio, and the first thing I heard was David J. Smith said, The Gathering.
[00:45:13.368 --> 00:45:14.589]  So it is, it is true.
[00:45:14.929 --> 00:45:16.809]  And so I moved from where I was to Texas.
[00:45:18.769 --> 00:45:32.052]  No, I know, Pastor David J. Smith says that back in the 80s, early 80s, he was a pastor in Arkansas, and God told him, move to Texas, move to Waxahachie, and start a magazine and a radio show, and expose the coming New World Order.
[00:45:32.612 --> 00:45:33.152]  And he did it.
[00:45:34.193 --> 00:45:34.713]  That's like 25 years ago.
[00:45:36.437 --> 00:45:40.960]  I know to a lot of people it sounds crazy, but I heard it, and that's all I can tell you.
[00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:43.081]  Well, and look what popped up in Austin, Texas!
[00:45:43.742 --> 00:45:47.224]  Right in the middle of Texas, and all the stuff that's been generated out of here.
[00:45:47.864 --> 00:45:48.885]  Something to it, I guess.
[00:45:50.526 --> 00:45:52.947]  I didn't have to go to any gathering, though, I'm from Texas.
[00:45:53.588 --> 00:46:02.093]  Yeah, and the way I understand it, he's got certain spots he's set aside for his people, and he's preparing his people.
[00:46:02.734 --> 00:46:08.842]  And a lot of people that believe that they're going to be taken up before all the trial and tribulation, that's a bunch of bull.
[00:46:09.634 --> 00:46:10.695]  It's nowhere in there.
[00:46:10.735 --> 00:46:13.436]  It says the Antichrist wages war on the saints.
[00:46:13.456 --> 00:46:14.496]  It describes it all.
[00:46:14.556 --> 00:46:18.218]  The other Christians believe the Antichrist is Jesus.
[00:46:18.978 --> 00:46:21.600]  But the churches are saying, no, Jesus is about to arrive.
[00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:24.941]  And the first one, you know, is Beelzebub.
[00:46:25.001 --> 00:46:30.324]  I mean, again, this isn't even a religious show, but we have guests on that cover that, because the elites also believe in it.
[00:46:30.884 --> 00:46:33.065]  They just believe in the bad guy.
[00:46:33.985 --> 00:46:37.647]  I don't want you to think that I'm such a great, you know, what?
[00:46:38.277 --> 00:46:45.402]  But when I was little and I was in church, this minister was telling about the people being taken up.
[00:46:46.502 --> 00:46:49.604]  And God said in my heart, don't believe him, that's not true.
[00:46:50.125 --> 00:46:50.345]  Yeah.
[00:46:50.925 --> 00:46:52.626]  And so I've known ever since I was little.
[00:46:53.227 --> 00:46:56.108]  And then I've learned since then that it has to happen.
[00:46:56.168 --> 00:46:56.549]  Me too.
[00:46:56.629 --> 00:46:59.691]  I remember the preacher saying that and his voice telling me it was a lie.
[00:47:00.461 --> 00:47:00.621]  Yeah.
[00:47:00.741 --> 00:47:02.003]  I remember knowing that was a lie.
[00:47:02.023 --> 00:47:05.387]  I remember knowing the preacher was a low-down little money-grubber.
[00:47:05.728 --> 00:47:06.889]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[00:47:06.969 --> 00:47:08.091]  I've got to go here.
[00:47:08.111 --> 00:47:13.097]  I'm going to try to get to Matty and Bill and Scott after I play some of these clips.
[00:47:13.137 --> 00:47:14.859]  Now, I played Part 1 and 2 yesterday.
[00:47:16.161 --> 00:47:18.984]  We've got the YouTube video of this posted
[00:47:20.831 --> 00:47:23.293]  Up on Infowars.com.
[00:47:23.313 --> 00:47:32.582]  In fact, let me just go here and pull up the video page itself so I can give you the headline for people out there that are watching right now on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:47:33.463 --> 00:47:39.869]  If you want to... No, I can't find it.
[00:47:40.590 --> 00:47:41.150]  I had them.
[00:47:41.210 --> 00:47:42.091]  I had the clips.
[00:47:42.592 --> 00:47:44.654]  Well, it doesn't matter.
[00:47:45.414 --> 00:47:45.735]  Pardon me?
[00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:49.171]  Well, I know there's clips.
[00:47:49.491 --> 00:47:52.114]  I need the headline of the article.
[00:47:52.794 --> 00:47:56.037]  John, what's the headline on the article that has the YouTube clips posted?
[00:47:56.377 --> 00:47:58.339]  American Militia Media Spin.
[00:47:58.719 --> 00:48:03.343]  AmericaMilitiaMediaSpinInfoWars.com and you will get it.
[00:48:04.591 --> 00:48:13.038]  Now, the thing about this video is, and there's a whole bunch of other ones similar, they were demonizing the militia and the media before they were going to bomb Oklahoma City and blame it on the militia.
[00:48:13.678 --> 00:48:26.869]  The militia was made up of former military people of intelligence who were told, the military's getting ready for gun confiscations, we're training for gun confiscations, the troops are being given questionnaires for gun confiscations, they're going to bankrupt the economy, and they got documents.
[00:48:27.089 --> 00:48:27.990]  And we got documents.
[00:48:28.610 --> 00:48:44.101]  You know I came on the scene right after this in 94 and a lot of people woke up because they were getting the core documents and they were learning about the secret FEMA camps that are now on the mainstream news and they were talking about all this and discussing all of this
[00:48:44.941 --> 00:48:47.382]  And so, they came out and tried to warn people.
[00:48:47.462 --> 00:48:55.265]  And the first two parts we played yesterday, Donahue's laughing at them, saying, you're cavemen that live in the woods, you got secret guns, you're gun nuts, you're crazy.
[00:48:55.805 --> 00:49:04.549]  And they just walk through the gun confiscations going on in the inner cities, they walk through the police state, they say what's going to come in the decades to come, they lay it all out beautifully.
[00:49:04.949 --> 00:49:06.791]  So we're going to go ahead and play three minutes of that now.
[00:49:06.891 --> 00:49:10.374]  Come back after break and play several parts of this.
[00:49:10.674 --> 00:49:13.116]  This is part three, four, and five.
[00:49:13.877 --> 00:49:15.559]  Here we go with that audio.
[00:49:16.667 --> 00:49:20.710]  You better love all God's children, regardless of color.
[00:49:20.730 --> 00:49:21.230]  Really?
[00:49:42.145 --> 00:49:42.405]  Really?
[00:49:42.545 --> 00:49:42.946]  Unity?
[00:49:42.966 --> 00:49:43.206]  Order?
[00:49:43.226 --> 00:49:44.266]  They come to the Lord, do they?
[00:49:44.787 --> 00:49:45.687]  Do I want to tell you something?
[00:49:45.707 --> 00:49:46.788]  Here's a bulletin for you.
[00:49:47.369 --> 00:49:49.910]  They are not throwing their guns away, and you can quote me.
[00:49:50.231 --> 00:49:54.994]  But you can challenge the observation if you want, and this audience wants in when we come back in just a moment.
[00:50:08.172 --> 00:50:11.254]  Sir, I'd just briefly like to know, like, what do you do for jobs?
[00:50:11.274 --> 00:50:12.494]  Do you have, like, normal jobs?
[00:50:12.514 --> 00:50:12.815]  Do you work?
[00:50:12.835 --> 00:50:13.315]  You guys work?
[00:50:13.335 --> 00:50:13.615]  Yes, I do.
[00:50:13.915 --> 00:50:14.836]  You're all employed?
[00:50:14.956 --> 00:50:15.616]  I'm even employed, yes.
[00:50:15.636 --> 00:50:15.956]  Absolutely.
[00:50:16.517 --> 00:50:17.157]  Uh-huh.
[00:50:17.557 --> 00:50:21.719]  Legally and, uh... That was a rotten thing to say.
[00:50:21.739 --> 00:50:22.280]  No, no, well...
[00:50:24.882 --> 00:50:26.183]  We're not TV commentators.
[00:50:26.283 --> 00:50:32.209]  I would have hoped you would see it as an attempt by the host to clarify your rather nebulous answer.
[00:50:32.289 --> 00:50:34.772]  Alright, your grievance is on the record.
[00:50:34.812 --> 00:50:35.012]  Yes.
[00:50:35.493 --> 00:50:37.475]  Well, you're telling us we should be afraid of our government.
[00:50:37.555 --> 00:50:42.380]  Why should we be afraid of you and your dictating Christian rules?
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:42.700]  No, no, no.
[00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:44.222]  There's no dictating.
[00:50:47.204 --> 00:51:01.452]  What you should be afraid of is comments like Senator Sam Nunn said on June 1st, 1994 in the New York Times when he said, I think the American people would welcome a Russian military force for peacekeeping purposes.
[00:51:01.952 --> 00:51:03.273]  That's what you should be afraid of.
[00:51:03.333 --> 00:51:04.554]  Those are the questions you should ask.
[00:51:04.854 --> 00:51:06.375]  You're afraid of the Ruskies?
[00:51:06.696 --> 00:51:08.137]  You're still afraid of Russia?
[00:51:08.217 --> 00:51:11.459]  Why do we need Russian peacekeeping forces in the United States?
[00:51:11.839 --> 00:51:13.240]  That's what I think we ought to ask.
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:15.162]  You're an old cold warrior.
[00:51:15.182 --> 00:51:16.102]  It's over.
[00:51:16.683 --> 00:51:17.163]  It's over.
[00:51:18.044 --> 00:51:20.005]  Something bad certainly could happen to us.
[00:51:20.025 --> 00:51:21.286]  Why does Sam Nunn want to bring him here?
[00:51:22.167 --> 00:51:22.607]  Ask him.
[00:51:23.267 --> 00:51:25.609]  One of you said that you're going to make a better world for us.
[00:51:25.629 --> 00:51:27.831]  I don't want to live in that world that you're making.
[00:51:30.070 --> 00:51:33.511]  My friend, you don't know the world.
[00:51:33.731 --> 00:51:35.752]  You're just hearing what you hear today.
[00:51:35.812 --> 00:51:36.652]  You don't know us.
[00:51:36.672 --> 00:51:37.652]  What world are we making?
[00:51:37.872 --> 00:51:39.213]  You don't know what we believe in.
[00:51:39.233 --> 00:51:40.473]  All we are is public servants.
[00:51:40.753 --> 00:51:41.734]  We train every weekend.
[00:51:41.754 --> 00:51:42.734]  You know what we train for?
[00:51:43.214 --> 00:51:44.234]  We train in first aid.
[00:51:44.274 --> 00:51:45.395]  We train in compass work.
[00:51:45.415 --> 00:51:46.755]  We train in search and rescue.
[00:51:47.135 --> 00:51:52.437]  We're there in case of a natural disaster that we can come out and serve and effectively help people.
[00:51:52.457 --> 00:51:57.899]  If a child is lost in the woods, we can have 500 men out there in the woods helping to find that lost child and serve that sheriff.
[00:51:57.919 --> 00:51:58.719]  We're public servants.
[00:51:59.079 --> 00:52:01.862]  Hey, you know what I've noticed?
[00:52:01.902 --> 00:52:08.488]  I was in there listening to the radio.
[00:52:08.508 --> 00:52:10.790]  It's like a minute and a half delay on the internet.
[00:52:10.810 --> 00:52:13.893]  It got a lot lower once that clip started playing than me.
[00:52:20.262 --> 00:52:21.722]  No, they're coming out the same levels.
[00:52:22.383 --> 00:52:22.863]  That's weird.
[00:52:23.763 --> 00:52:24.083]  Whatever.
[00:52:24.103 --> 00:52:25.263]  I can double check it.
[00:52:25.303 --> 00:52:25.884]  No, it doesn't matter.
[00:52:25.904 --> 00:52:27.344]  I always play it to the right levels.
[00:52:27.524 --> 00:52:28.044]  No, I hear you.
[00:52:28.224 --> 00:52:30.025]  It's just that... ...serve that sheriff.
[00:52:30.045 --> 00:52:36.546]  We're public servants... On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:52:36.586 --> 00:52:37.867]  And we knew what to do.
[00:52:46.567 --> 00:52:47.608]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:52:47.848 --> 00:52:54.274]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:52:54.914 --> 00:53:03.442]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:53:03.802 --> 00:53:10.588]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:53:10.868 --> 00:53:13.929]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:53:14.049 --> 00:53:17.791]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was BOOM!
[00:53:17.931 --> 00:53:18.191]  BOOM!
[00:53:18.251 --> 00:53:18.511]  BOOM!
[00:53:18.571 --> 00:53:18.831]  BOOM!
[00:53:18.891 --> 00:53:19.212]  BOOM!
[00:53:19.332 --> 00:53:22.613]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:53:22.913 --> 00:53:28.756]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[00:53:28.956 --> 00:53:31.097]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:53:31.877 --> 00:53:36.779]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:53:39.079 --> 00:53:42.924]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[00:53:42.964 --> 00:53:44.205]  dollar has been devaluating.
[00:53:44.365 --> 00:53:47.949]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[00:53:48.250 --> 00:53:50.753]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[00:53:51.153 --> 00:53:52.915]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[00:53:53.235 --> 00:53:55.378]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[00:53:56.579 --> 00:54:11.006]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800, but your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[00:54:11.066 --> 00:54:14.148]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[00:54:14.348 --> 00:54:20.831]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[00:54:21.311 --> 00:54:23.993]  Get all your questions answered before your money is worth zero.
[00:54:24.213 --> 00:54:24.433]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:54:26.894 --> 00:54:32.057]  Take action today while we still accept paper dollars for gold.
[00:54:32.397 --> 00:54:32.917]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[00:54:38.075 --> 00:54:43.098]  HempUSA.org is now offering free shipping worldwide to better serve our customers.
[00:54:43.418 --> 00:54:49.642]  Our goal is to get these fine hemp products to you in the least amount of time so you can enjoy what the powder seeds and oil can do for you.
[00:54:49.862 --> 00:54:52.323]  HempUSA.org has a warning that the U.S.
[00:54:52.363 --> 00:54:57.506]  food supplies are dangerously low and we urge you to protect your family with hemp storable foods today.
[00:54:57.686 --> 00:54:58.947]  Tomorrow may be too late.
[00:54:59.107 --> 00:55:03.409]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit HempUSA.org.
[00:55:03.610 --> 00:55:07.892]  This incredible food source is loaded with enzymes so your body can digest the food you eat.
[00:55:08.172 --> 00:55:08.532]  I think so.
[00:55:38.047 --> 00:55:46.774]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:55:46.974 --> 00:55:51.758]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:55:52.118 --> 00:56:03.247]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:56:03.647 --> 00:56:09.191]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:56:09.411 --> 00:56:15.495]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:56:15.675 --> 00:56:16.336]  What about you?
[00:56:16.716 --> 00:56:18.617]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.
[00:56:18.637 --> 00:56:22.740]  $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.
[00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:27.183]  Nonetheless, it was the Trachman family was the first one there.
[00:56:27.643 --> 00:56:31.326]  Long before any other people were out for the first part.
[00:56:32.572 --> 00:56:35.515]  Just because of people like you are, we have to bring the Russians.
[00:56:35.595 --> 00:56:37.517]  Because we have to keep peace here.
[00:56:37.617 --> 00:56:48.187]  And how we can keep peace here, if we have people like you are?
[00:56:48.267 --> 00:56:50.249]  What do we show our children?
[00:56:50.309 --> 00:56:55.253]  We have to show our children how to keep peace without weapons.
[00:56:55.393 --> 00:56:56.434]  It's about time.
[00:56:56.454 --> 00:56:57.515]  What are you doing?
[00:56:59.378 --> 00:57:07.143]  You're just damaging the next generation, and you're damaging the life of your children in the first place.
[00:57:07.183 --> 00:57:10.905]  If you joined us late, I might be able to help you here.
[00:57:10.925 --> 00:57:15.928]  She said that it's okay to bring Russian troops here, and they're applauding.
[00:57:16.288 --> 00:57:21.592]  You're applauding that troops are being brought here in equipment that's carrying deadly nerve gas here.
[00:57:21.972 --> 00:57:24.453]  We have documented evidence of this being brought here.
[00:57:24.793 --> 00:57:28.836]  We have confirmation from military sources on the subject, and you're clapping?
[00:57:29.602 --> 00:57:35.287]  Sometimes I wonder, because I was asked this question among the thousands of phone calls my house gets on the militia.
[00:57:35.647 --> 00:57:36.608]  I've been asked this question.
[00:57:36.628 --> 00:57:38.289]  Do you think this country is ready for it?
[00:57:38.309 --> 00:57:39.731]  Do you think this country deserves freedom?
[00:57:40.411 --> 00:57:43.133]  Okay, maybe I'm saying from this applause, I don't mean to alienate the audience.
[00:57:43.694 --> 00:57:47.817]  If we don't get our heads out of the sand and wake up, we're going to get whatever we deserve, people.
[00:57:48.018 --> 00:57:50.319]  Why are your children playing with guns?
[00:57:50.379 --> 00:57:51.601]  Where are they getting the guns, lady?
[00:57:51.941 --> 00:57:53.722]  Where do the guns come from?
[00:57:53.742 --> 00:57:54.503]  What is your point?
[00:57:54.703 --> 00:57:55.384]  Make the point.
[00:57:55.424 --> 00:57:56.465]  You keep asking questions.
[00:57:56.485 --> 00:57:57.926]  The point is this.
[00:57:58.917 --> 00:58:00.538]  This is a local sheriff.
[00:58:01.859 --> 00:58:02.900]  You're laughing at this?
[00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:04.741]  This is a local sheriff.
[00:58:05.102 --> 00:58:06.102]  That's his vehicle.
[00:58:06.563 --> 00:58:08.084]  That's an armored vehicle, folks.
[00:58:08.164 --> 00:58:09.065]  It says sheriff on it.
[00:58:09.325 --> 00:58:12.767]  In Washington State, in every major U.S.
[00:58:12.827 --> 00:58:22.554]  city and the small ones, like Bay City, Michigan, the police officers are getting hand grenades, hand grenade launchers, and CS gas, like they use to kill the people in Waco.
[00:58:22.835 --> 00:58:27.378]  If you find humor in that, talk to me later on, because you're looking at a different radio program.
[00:58:27.418 --> 00:58:28.739]  Let's review it for a second.
[00:58:28.919 --> 00:58:36.142]  Very recently, in our last election, we threw a lot of what we called the bums who were spending our money out of government.
[00:58:36.502 --> 00:58:37.463]  We hate government.
[00:58:37.803 --> 00:58:39.264]  We are ready for these guys.
[00:58:39.524 --> 00:58:40.804]  We think government is too big.
[00:58:41.065 --> 00:58:42.925]  We think taxes are confiscatory.
[00:58:43.206 --> 00:58:48.448]  We think the government is knocking down too many doors without the appropriate papers to do so.
[00:58:48.888 --> 00:58:52.750]  We also think there are a lot of people standing up and applauding the government when they do this.
[00:58:52.810 --> 00:58:54.171]  Say what you want about these guys.
[00:58:54.631 --> 00:58:56.672]  They respect the Bill of Rights.
[00:58:57.112 --> 00:59:00.675]  They don't think anybody from the federal government should be knocking anybody's door down.
[00:59:00.975 --> 00:59:04.977]  Certainly not without judicial approval, and so they're taking it one step further.
[00:59:05.177 --> 00:59:08.059]  They're not only voting to throw the guys out, they're waiting.
[00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:12.842]  They're waiting for anarchy, and when it comes they say they're gonna be ready, and you're not.
[00:59:13.183 --> 00:59:15.084]  And whenever they get into mainstream media,
[00:59:15.724 --> 00:59:18.947]  And a report is given in the paper about where they're meeting or where they're training.
[00:59:19.167 --> 00:59:20.328]  You draw a big crowd, don't you?
[00:59:20.728 --> 00:59:21.569]  Lots of folks come?
[00:59:22.089 --> 00:59:22.569]  Yeah?
[00:59:22.690 --> 00:59:23.650]  Not 10 million.
[00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:25.211]  Come on, you pull that out of your hat.
[00:59:25.271 --> 00:59:26.492]  Get out of here.
[00:59:26.512 --> 00:59:27.153]  10 million?
[00:59:27.293 --> 00:59:29.815]  I'll make you a watch if you have 10 million people in your house.
[00:59:29.835 --> 00:59:31.896]  Good, I'll keep your address and I'll tell you my size.
[00:59:32.577 --> 00:59:34.398]  You don't.
[00:59:34.518 --> 00:59:36.680]  Here's what, 150,000 people.
[00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:37.441]  That's max.
[00:59:37.501 --> 00:59:38.562]  That may be what you have.
[00:59:38.582 --> 00:59:39.382]  Let me point this out.
[00:59:39.442 --> 00:59:40.163]  Now we work...
[00:59:40.803 --> 00:59:49.029]  There's three or four of us that work on a full-time basis in just keeping together the associations.
[00:59:49.509 --> 01:00:00.576]  Single radio programs, for example in Phoenix, Arizona, generates 200 phone calls of persons that want to develop their own individual groups of militia.
[01:00:01.057 --> 01:00:07.801]  At this point in time, we have no idea the best estimate is anywhere from eight and a half to ten million, believe it or not.
[01:00:07.861 --> 01:00:09.122]  Just one question before I break.
[01:00:09.142 --> 01:00:10.443]  It's a yes or no question.
[01:00:10.924 --> 01:00:12.285]  Do you stock armament?
[01:00:12.746 --> 01:00:16.250]  Absolutely, we stock whatever is necessary to protect ourselves.
[01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:27.483]  Under the Constitution... Would you stock... Under the Constitution... That includes semi-automatic weapons and all the... Are you talking automatic or semi or do you know what the difference is?
[01:00:28.004 --> 01:00:28.825]  What if I don't?
[01:00:29.165 --> 01:00:33.168]  No, if you don't, then you're in trouble, because... We're going to have to understand guns.
[01:00:33.368 --> 01:00:34.629]  Do you stockpile hand grenades?
[01:00:34.669 --> 01:00:37.991]  Absolutely not, and that's foolishness.
[01:00:38.031 --> 01:00:39.472]  No, you don't like hand grenades.
[01:00:39.492 --> 01:00:40.393]  That's foolishness.
[01:00:40.453 --> 01:00:41.153]  But you do have AK-47s.
[01:00:41.193 --> 01:00:42.034]  That's illegal, Phil.
[01:00:42.074 --> 01:00:43.175]  You do have AK-47s.
[01:00:43.635 --> 01:00:45.176]  That's illegal, Phil.
[01:00:45.416 --> 01:00:48.538]  You have to learn what's legal and illegal so that you don't get in trouble.
[01:00:48.599 --> 01:00:56.404]  We have two people who are involved in watching out for human rights, monitoring the activity of what
[01:00:57.009 --> 01:00:59.373]  Many call extreme right-wing groups.
[01:00:59.893 --> 01:01:02.016]  Gentlemen, maybe you're flattered by that definition.
[01:01:02.177 --> 01:01:03.639]  Absolutely not.
[01:01:03.799 --> 01:01:04.620]  It's totally wrong.
[01:01:05.081 --> 01:01:10.048]  We'll talk with them and give them a chance to ask their own questions of these folks when we come back in just a moment.
[01:01:26.909 --> 01:01:27.850]  This is Waco.
[01:01:33.214 --> 01:01:35.736]  Here is, incidentally, who's responsible for this?
[01:01:37.718 --> 01:01:46.625]  And, you know, well, is this the way you want your official response to express itself here?
[01:01:46.945 --> 01:01:47.846]  There you go, folks.
[01:01:48.326 --> 01:01:53.511]  And what we've done here with this kind of action, which incidentally
[01:01:56.579 --> 01:01:59.560]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:03.221]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:02:06.463 --> 01:02:12.144]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history... And yes, folks, we know we're on air.
[01:02:12.305 --> 01:02:14.105]  We just do our behind the scenes on air now.
[01:02:14.125 --> 01:02:14.725]  That's how we do it.
[01:02:15.466 --> 01:02:18.187]  All right, going back to John.
[01:02:18.467 --> 01:02:22.708]  John, I'll come in, we'll play the last minute or so of that, then I'll comment on it, then we'll play the next ten minute piece, okay?
[01:02:23.028 --> 01:02:23.448]  You got it.
[01:02:23.889 --> 01:02:24.269]  Thank you.
[01:02:24.609 --> 01:02:24.969]  No problem.
[01:02:28.115 --> 01:02:35.964]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[01:02:36.544 --> 01:02:39.988]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:02:45.555 --> 01:02:51.238]  The Israeli Intelligence Network, Warnings and War Games, The Shadow Government, and much much more, Fabled Enemies.

[01:03:09.614 --> 01:03:11.675]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[01:03:11.915 --> 01:03:14.917]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[01:03:15.217 --> 01:03:21.701]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[01:03:22.102 --> 01:03:24.323]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[01:03:24.723 --> 01:03:27.785]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.

[01:03:32.788 --> 01:03:36.470]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[01:03:36.730 --> 01:03:38.251]  Travel less, meet online.

[01:05:07.279 --> 01:05:09.800]  Here is, incidentally, who's responsible for this?
[01:05:11.761 --> 01:05:15.323]  And, you know, well, is this the way you want?
[01:05:16.690 --> 01:05:20.652]  Your official response to express itself here?
[01:05:20.993 --> 01:05:21.853]  There you go, folks.
[01:05:22.373 --> 01:05:41.344]  And, uh, what we've done here with this kind of, uh, action, which incidentally, uh, I don't know what post, uh, analysis has developed and whether anybody's taken any responsibility, but that action makes men here who are part of militias feel that they're doing the right thing.
[01:05:42.185 --> 01:05:51.759]  Not to be confused with... The President and also Reno, our Attorney General, took responsibility for it and it should rest right on their shoulders.
[01:05:52.019 --> 01:05:53.722]  They need to watch that tape a few times.
[01:05:53.802 --> 01:05:57.988]  Tom Halpern is Associate Director of the Fact-Finding Department at the Anti-Defamation League in New York City.
[01:05:59.498 --> 01:06:05.660]  And you're here with Dennis Hennigan, who is director of the Legal Action Project of the City of the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence in D.C.
[01:06:06.301 --> 01:06:07.601]  Is it the Brady Bill?
[01:06:07.821 --> 01:06:11.663]  The crime bill had an anti-automatic weapons provision.
[01:06:11.683 --> 01:06:12.423]  Do I understand that?
[01:06:12.443 --> 01:06:12.683]  That's right.
[01:06:12.703 --> 01:06:13.383]  A ban on assault weapons.
[01:06:13.403 --> 01:06:14.243]  A ban on assault weapons.
[01:06:14.744 --> 01:06:19.045]  You feel this is just two of stories that excited interest in this country.
[01:06:19.085 --> 01:06:20.446]  Why don't you just give them a chance?
[01:06:20.466 --> 01:06:20.966]  Thank you.
[01:06:21.766 --> 01:06:27.528]  I think that the enactment of these federal gun control laws were the flashpoints for this militia movement.
[01:06:28.829 --> 01:06:34.375]  Clearly, these people believe that they have a right to resist by force of arms
[01:06:35.222 --> 01:06:35.802]  Well, keep in mind, Phil,
[01:07:01.857 --> 01:07:02.779]  Okay, hit pause there.
[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:04.765]  We're going to go to the number four clip, right, John?
[01:07:11.638 --> 01:07:12.839]  That clip's over, correct, John?
[01:07:12.999 --> 01:07:13.419]  That's correct.
[01:07:13.959 --> 01:07:26.545]  Okay, we're playing it from the studio up in Minnesota because it has better audio quality there, and then we're also, for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, playing the video from our end in Texas for people that are watching at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:07:27.285 --> 01:07:39.471]  Now remember, Henry Paulson's come out now and they're about to pass a bill saying total anonymity, total liability protection, no one can ever even investigate it, trillions being stolen, that's the bailout, and then it's unlimited.
[01:07:40.287 --> 01:07:43.803]  This Congress signing over all authority, which the President declares they have none anyways.
[01:07:45.646 --> 01:07:47.747]  Army brigades being called into the U.S.
[01:07:47.868 --> 01:07:50.509]  saying that it's to engage the American people.
[01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:52.691]  Wall-to-wall corruption.
[01:07:52.731 --> 01:07:53.912]  Bill of Rights in tatters.
[01:07:53.972 --> 01:07:56.133]  Warrantless gun confiscation going on everywhere.
[01:07:56.153 --> 01:08:00.996]  A couple months ago, the governor of Illinois announces they're going to use the Army to confiscate guns.
[01:08:01.376 --> 01:08:03.138]  Gun confiscation in South Texas.
[01:08:03.178 --> 01:08:04.659]  Gun confiscation in New Orleans.
[01:08:05.079 --> 01:08:06.560]  Gun confiscation going on.
[01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:10.923]  Everything these guys talked about 14 years ago, now happening.
[01:08:11.963 --> 01:08:14.325]  And just a completely lawless criminal government.
[01:08:16.288 --> 01:08:19.070]  And then we've got the saps from the ADL and others.
[01:08:19.671 --> 01:08:28.739]  Now it's come out in government declassified documents and FBI files that what we told you over a decade ago, the Southern Poverty Law Center was running the white supremacist compound.
[01:08:28.779 --> 01:08:30.440]  They had the two head people there under their funding.
[01:08:31.361 --> 01:08:36.706]  Not just there, they were running the thing with connections to the bombing of Oklahoma City.
[01:08:38.988 --> 01:08:39.829]  These people are sick.
[01:08:40.349 --> 01:08:41.070]  Very, very sick.
[01:08:42.059 --> 01:08:44.540]  Let's go ahead, and by the way, that's been in the mainstream newspapers now.
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:46.381]  You're not going to stop us.
[01:08:46.661 --> 01:08:54.324]  The people know what you've done, and now in hindsight, now the first ten minutes of the interview, the first twenty minutes,
[01:08:55.967 --> 01:08:57.289]  Donahue is attacking them.
[01:08:57.649 --> 01:08:59.111]  He's a well-meaning, bleeding-heart liberal.
[01:08:59.151 --> 01:09:02.836]  Then he hears what they say and kind of wakes up halfway in, starts being a little bit nicer.
[01:09:03.357 --> 01:09:06.141]  You notice, because they're so eloquent and he's listening.
[01:09:07.022 --> 01:09:09.826]  So he's realizing that he's getting his butt kicked here.
[01:09:10.386 --> 01:09:11.808]  Let's go ahead and go back to the next clip.
[01:09:11.828 --> 01:09:12.149]  Here it is.
[01:09:13.285 --> 01:09:13.445]  I think?
[01:09:34.335 --> 01:09:37.497]  Well, you have to remember, of course, there were two raids in Waco.
[01:09:37.637 --> 01:09:42.141]  In the first one, several federal law enforcement officers were shot and killed.
[01:09:42.161 --> 01:09:47.605]  Now, that's not to excuse what happened in the fiery inferno afterwards, and that was a real tragedy.
[01:09:49.786 --> 01:09:57.613]  Sir, I just want to say it's that kind of an event that I think the militia groups are exploiting as a means of trying to advance their agenda.
[01:09:57.734 --> 01:09:59.475]  And the agenda is?
[01:09:59.495 --> 01:10:06.601]  Well, the agenda is, and it's in the literature that we've seen at the ADL, to thwart gun control laws.
[01:10:06.982 --> 01:10:13.368]  And it claims, now it gets into these issues of privacy, but then I begin hearing all this... Alright, hit pause, hit pause, hit pause.
[01:10:14.605 --> 01:10:16.146]  To thwart gun control laws.
[01:10:16.566 --> 01:10:19.808]  That's our right to lobby and try to change government.
[01:10:21.569 --> 01:10:27.812]  Also, it's in the Declaration of Independence that it's a right and a duty to throw off government that tries to take your liberties.
[01:10:30.013 --> 01:10:34.355]  I mean, it's so clear who the anti-Americans are in this situation.
[01:10:34.895 --> 01:10:36.196]  Let's go ahead and go back to it.
[01:10:37.102 --> 01:10:49.008]  And it claims, now it gets into these issues of privacy, but then I begin hearing all this sort of stuff about the New World Order and a One World Socialist Government, and I think the American people kind of know how to judge that.
[01:10:49.568 --> 01:10:50.809]  Oh, it paused again!
[01:10:50.829 --> 01:10:55.231]  He thinks the American people know how to judge that.
[01:10:56.212 --> 01:10:58.033]  Presidents, Prime Ministers call for it.
[01:10:58.053 --> 01:11:02.035]  There have been like two Prime Ministers and four or five Presidents last month call for it.
[01:11:07.342 --> 01:11:09.044]  Sorry, trying to eat here during the break.
[01:11:10.506 --> 01:11:15.812]  Just inhaled a piece of, um, piece of, uh, spinach.
[01:11:19.227 --> 01:11:23.209]  I was eating and I went, hold on, I'm back live, I want to comment on that.
[01:11:23.669 --> 01:11:24.489]  I'm just going to play it.
[01:11:24.509 --> 01:11:25.890]  There's just so much bull here.
[01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:31.953]  Somebody ought to watch the whole 50 minutes of this garbage and then write an analysis of it.
[01:11:33.073 --> 01:11:36.915]  But, oh yeah, there's no North American Union, no New World Order.
[01:11:37.275 --> 01:11:43.958]  Foreign corporations aren't, with our tax money that's given to them in bailouts, buying up all our infrastructure.
[01:11:44.199 --> 01:11:44.879]  Just back to it.
[01:11:46.138 --> 01:11:49.260]  Full flak jacket and all helmets and a full regalia.
[01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:50.721]  I'm sorry, hit pause again.
[01:11:51.702 --> 01:11:54.964]  Cops in black ski masks, armored vehicles, helicopters.
[01:11:55.745 --> 01:11:59.968]  All of this stuff's good and these cowardly socialists feel safe.
[01:12:01.109 --> 01:12:06.132]  But then they... Got that piece of spinach back there.
[01:12:06.773 --> 01:12:07.973]  They feel safe seeing that.
[01:12:09.014 --> 01:12:11.616]  Oh, it's real radio and TV, so what?
[01:12:13.637 --> 01:12:14.418]  God almighty.
[01:12:14.718 --> 01:12:15.679]  I feel better now.
[01:12:16.892 --> 01:12:17.693]  Still back there, though.
[01:12:19.094 --> 01:12:19.735]  You know how it is.
[01:12:19.755 --> 01:12:20.355]  A little bit of peace.
[01:12:22.217 --> 01:12:23.418]  There's the culprit, right there.
[01:12:23.438 --> 01:12:27.242]  Oh, it doesn't matter anymore.
[01:12:27.342 --> 01:12:27.762]  Whatever.
[01:12:27.782 --> 01:12:28.623]  The government's good.
[01:12:28.663 --> 01:12:29.484]  The militia's evil.
[01:12:29.784 --> 01:12:30.685]  Let's just agree with the government.
[01:12:30.705 --> 01:12:31.446]  I'm being sarcastic.
[01:12:32.046 --> 01:12:32.987]  By the way, I was just...
[01:12:34.306 --> 01:12:41.008]  Made abreast of the situation about two weeks ago, and now it's really reached fever pitch, like all stalkers do.
[01:12:41.048 --> 01:12:43.008]  We have to end up going after them legally, usually.
[01:12:43.908 --> 01:12:47.169]  Somebody's created thirty, forty, fifty accounts.
[01:12:48.110 --> 01:12:49.950]  It's an army of people, as much work as they're doing.
[01:12:49.970 --> 01:12:51.070]  It's got to be at least ten people.
[01:12:52.331 --> 01:12:56.652]  And they clone things, like one of our listeners has the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[01:12:57.112 --> 01:13:00.853]  He creates something that looks like the Alex Jones Channel, it's only slightly different in the name,
[01:13:02.216 --> 01:13:07.098]  And it says, I'm Alex Jones, and I've got to watch what I say, because then they'll edit it.
[01:13:08.518 --> 01:13:17.682]  But they say things like, I'm Alex Jones, and then they say, I want to, you know, K-I-L-L, that's what they say, Bill O'Reilly.
[01:13:18.182 --> 01:13:25.364]  And then they also take things I say on the show, and they edit them all together to where it sounds like that.
[01:13:26.085 --> 01:13:29.626]  And it's the same kind of black ops we saw with Malkin's people who were withered.
[01:13:30.871 --> 01:13:35.034]  Screaming, kill Michelle Malkin, kill Michelle Malkin, and then having that put out on national news.
[01:13:36.195 --> 01:13:38.236]  So, they're definitely taking the gloves off.
[01:13:38.817 --> 01:13:47.663]  And they've got me, there's all these channels with video edited, with me saying, I hate America, stuff like that, edited together.
[01:13:47.683 --> 01:13:51.125]  Because they can take hundreds of hours of radio and edit them together.
[01:13:52.326 --> 01:13:53.727]  And it's just a full court presence.
[01:13:53.747 --> 01:13:54.967]  People claiming they're patriots.
[01:13:55.328 --> 01:13:57.229]  People who say they aren't patriots.
[01:13:57.909 --> 01:14:00.250]  It's people who admittedly are military.
[01:14:00.330 --> 01:14:01.010]  It's government.
[01:14:01.431 --> 01:14:02.731]  But it's not working, guys.
[01:14:02.791 --> 01:14:05.833]  I mean, no one believes anything you say anymore.
[01:14:06.433 --> 01:14:10.795]  And people are going to find out that those aren't my YouTube channels.
[01:14:11.375 --> 01:14:14.197]  They're going to find out that you've edited that video of me.
[01:14:15.197 --> 01:14:16.958]  And they're going to find out what you're doing.
[01:14:17.599 --> 01:14:18.619]  And I'm only one person.
[01:14:18.659 --> 01:14:24.483]  You can even probably destroy me down the road with physical means and other ways, but you can't destroy the message.
[01:14:24.824 --> 01:14:26.605]  The ideas are bulletproof, and they go on.
[01:14:27.105 --> 01:14:29.046]  So listeners, understand that this is life and death.
[01:14:29.066 --> 01:14:30.027]  This is really serious.
[01:14:30.387 --> 01:14:39.674]  The enemy's doing everything they can to stop us, and I need all of you out there to intensify your efforts with YouTube and LiveLeak and DailyMotion.
[01:14:39.974 --> 01:14:42.555]  You know, don't just post my videos or the audio on
[01:14:43.476 --> 01:14:45.137]  YouTube and Google, do it everywhere.
[01:14:45.477 --> 01:14:46.058]  Intensify.
[01:14:46.078 --> 01:14:47.899]  I mean, they really don't like what we're doing.
[01:14:47.939 --> 01:14:48.779]  It's hurting them badly.
[01:14:48.799 --> 01:14:51.081]  I mean, here's one right here.
[01:14:51.821 --> 01:14:54.202]  So they, well, they will edit it.
[01:14:54.242 --> 01:14:55.283]  They monitor it.
[01:14:55.503 --> 01:14:56.644]  It's definitely government.
[01:14:56.924 --> 01:14:58.065]  We're a large corporation.
[01:14:58.925 --> 01:15:08.611]  And it says right here, first psychopath to kill Bill O'Reilly will get one million donation from InfoWars.com.
[01:15:10.523 --> 01:15:11.684]  This is not a joke or parody.
[01:15:11.724 --> 01:15:13.924]  This is a serious call to execute someone for money.
[01:15:14.784 --> 01:15:15.745]  It is not terrorism.
[01:15:15.805 --> 01:15:17.025]  I am Alex Jones, a patriot.
[01:15:17.045 --> 01:15:25.147]  See, how this works is... Again, I was reading what the person claiming to be me is saying.
[01:15:25.207 --> 01:15:27.328]  I will no doubt edit that and put it out.
[01:15:28.808 --> 01:15:32.750]  And this is generally what's done to someone before they're killed or set up.
[01:15:33.450 --> 01:15:36.591]  Because there's all sorts of other dirty tricks I don't have time to go into.
[01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:40.172]  And I should take threats to myself more seriously.
[01:15:40.252 --> 01:15:44.136]  I'm kind of calmly sitting around joking and laughing about it, because it lets me know I'm really hurting them.
[01:15:45.697 --> 01:15:51.603]  And again, you see all these Patriot groups who've been active, you know, operating for a while, and they activate and suddenly start attacking me.
[01:15:52.003 --> 01:15:54.426]  You know, they tried to build their street cred before they did that.
[01:15:54.966 --> 01:15:59.550]  And I am the big kahuna in this movement, and they really are coming after me, which lets me know we're hurting them.
[01:16:00.553 --> 01:16:03.776]  I just put everything in God's hands, and it's going to be alright.
[01:16:05.057 --> 01:16:15.546]  But they have created websites, AlexJones.blogspot.com, and I need you, the listeners, to contact them and let them know that they're going to end up getting sued over this.
[01:16:16.006 --> 01:16:17.187]  This is not a parody.
[01:16:17.227 --> 01:16:20.790]  They say it's not a parody on here, so they're holding it out as if it's real.
[01:16:22.031 --> 01:16:23.112]  Blogspot needs to know that.
[01:16:23.132 --> 01:16:23.992]  That needs to be removed.
[01:16:24.032 --> 01:16:28.053]  Any other fake accounts holding themselves out as me need to be removed.
[01:16:28.553 --> 01:16:45.078]  YouTube needs to remove the Alex... Well, the full channel is a close copy to what the real Alex Jones Channel, that's also just a listener, is saying and doing.
[01:16:47.085 --> 01:16:48.167]  And it's just unbelievable.
[01:17:00.213 --> 01:17:01.894]  9-11 truths, dead stuff.
[01:17:02.574 --> 01:17:04.214]  It's just standard government operation.
[01:17:04.534 --> 01:17:06.495]  And there's now hundreds of these accounts.
[01:17:06.775 --> 01:17:08.015]  They're just all over the web.
[01:17:08.516 --> 01:17:09.896]  This is a huge operation.
[01:17:10.696 --> 01:17:14.337]  And we need to get screenshots of this because the enemy is going to try to blip in and blip out.
[01:17:14.678 --> 01:17:17.819]  They've also been doing that, changing it every time YouTube looks at it.
[01:17:18.499 --> 01:17:24.761]  And so they're claiming that I am calling for the murder of people on here, which of course I'm not.
[01:17:26.069 --> 01:17:30.293]  And they're also editing together things I've said in the past to make it sound like I'm saying that.
[01:17:30.473 --> 01:17:32.255]  And they're really coming after me right now.
[01:17:33.275 --> 01:17:36.478]  So they claim I'm holding out murder for hire in this clip.
[01:17:37.679 --> 01:17:46.507]  And then what they do is they then file similar complaints trying to get the legitimate channels that promote what I'm saying and doing.
[01:17:47.728 --> 01:17:50.151]  They then flag those and they've gotten a bunch of accounts deleted.
[01:17:51.269 --> 01:17:53.030]  Because the YouTube people aren't really paying attention?
[01:17:53.070 --> 01:17:54.912]  Or will they admit they're following Lieberman's staff?
[01:17:54.952 --> 01:17:55.532]  Maybe they know.
[01:17:56.272 --> 01:17:56.593]  Who knows?
[01:17:56.633 --> 01:17:57.273]  Maybe it's them.
[01:17:57.293 --> 01:17:58.294]  I don't know at this point.
[01:17:58.594 --> 01:17:59.695]  Because they're going along with it.
[01:17:59.955 --> 01:18:02.456]  The people will create accounts that sound like other people's accounts.
[01:18:03.177 --> 01:18:12.823]  They will then go and say, kill everyone, or murder these people, and then say that I said it or others said it, and put it in my name, and then they will have the accounts deleted.
[01:18:13.143 --> 01:18:15.085]  So that's the main reason for all of this.
[01:18:17.086 --> 01:18:19.628]  Now this person needs to know that the FBI
[01:18:20.984 --> 01:18:22.485]  Well, probably give them a visit.
[01:18:23.526 --> 01:18:24.707]  And I'm not joking about that.
[01:18:24.727 --> 01:18:26.148]  I'm a high-profile person.
[01:18:26.208 --> 01:18:40.740]  Other folks... What you don't understand is, when you go out and you say, I want murder for hire, just because you try to blame it on me, doesn't mean that then the government doesn't still consider that a solicitation for murder for hire.
[01:18:41.778 --> 01:18:48.261]  Because, now some cases they don't know anything about it because it is government or it's contractors or it's a group of mentally ill people.
[01:18:48.301 --> 01:18:48.821]  We don't know.
[01:18:49.162 --> 01:18:50.502]  We'll find out if this is government.
[01:18:50.962 --> 01:18:56.565]  If this continues, this is government or someone who is protected by government.
[01:18:57.646 --> 01:19:01.587]  But again, people are holding out all over the web that I am soliciting murder for hire.
[01:19:03.068 --> 01:19:04.489]  And they are
[01:19:10.336 --> 01:19:16.607]  They're also putting out a bunch of anti-semitic stuff and claiming that I put it out.
[01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:21.235]  This looks like an ADL or Southern Poverty Law Center operation.
[01:19:23.516 --> 01:19:25.517]  Just the people we were just talking about just now.
[01:19:25.597 --> 01:19:37.320]  The Southern Poverty Law Center that ran the two top people that founded the Elohim City Nazi compound, that was then involved in the bombing of Oklahoma City, now come out in major newspapers and in FBI documents.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.721]  So they don't play games, and if anybody bombs a federal building, it's not me.
[01:19:42.561 --> 01:19:43.582]  Or any of my listeners.
[01:19:44.742 --> 01:19:46.003]  I mean, this is false flag.
[01:19:46.423 --> 01:19:58.729]  They've already had people dressed up, wearing a mask of Alex Jones, a big sign saying, I bombed the, you know, they got a mask on, saying, I'm Alex Jones, I bombed the Military Recruiting Center.
[01:20:00.190 --> 01:20:02.231]  And, you know, doing that in front of news cameras.
[01:20:02.831 --> 01:20:06.673]  And it's just all sorts of operations to say 9-11 troops doing this.
[01:20:07.013 --> 01:20:10.615]  We're the ones that expose that you guys run false flags.
[01:20:13.044 --> 01:20:15.428]  So it is getting really, really bad.
[01:20:15.468 --> 01:20:19.434]  But I want everybody to know, this is the kind of stuff that gets me up out of bed in the morning.
[01:20:20.616 --> 01:20:27.427]  A lot of people get intimidated, get death threats, get death threats on their children and their wife, and it makes them wet themselves and go cry in the corner.
[01:20:28.385 --> 01:20:30.046]  My ancestors weren't like that.
[01:20:30.446 --> 01:20:32.207]  You can call it nature, nurture, whatever.
[01:20:32.247 --> 01:20:39.191]  But my ancestors were always the tip of the spear on both sides of my family and pioneers of this country.
[01:20:39.251 --> 01:20:39.931]  Love them or hate them.
[01:20:40.391 --> 01:20:41.372]  And we like to fight.
[01:20:41.852 --> 01:20:42.873]  We like adversity.
[01:20:42.913 --> 01:20:44.234]  We like going up against scum.
[01:20:44.874 --> 01:20:48.256]  And I'm just going to tell you right now that I actually wouldn't have the energy.
[01:20:49.016 --> 01:20:49.537]  And it's wrong.
[01:20:49.577 --> 01:21:05.918]  I'm trying not to tap into the energy that I get from people attacking me, because it gives me energy, it gives me power to resist, but I want to do it from a position of love and a position of calm focus, which I did the first few hours of the show today.
[01:21:06.810 --> 01:21:08.211]  Because I'm more effective that way.
[01:21:09.091 --> 01:21:16.154]  But it feels better, and it's more aggressive to just go ahead and focus on people attacking me, and then I can work 18 hours a day.
[01:21:16.974 --> 01:21:21.776]  But I can work 14 or 15 with love, and it's better product, better info.
[01:21:23.476 --> 01:21:25.257]  But I mean, this does not intimidate me.
[01:21:26.898 --> 01:21:35.641]  And I try not to get distracted or diverted by the attacks, but in a way we need to let folks know this firebase is taking heavy hits.
[01:21:36.722 --> 01:21:44.449]  A lot of attacks right now, but we can, like Jiu Jitsu or Judo, they're coming at us, we can step out of the way and let them go crashing through the wall.
[01:21:45.990 --> 01:21:54.858]  So if you recognize we're under attack, take our info, boost it, get it out to people, explain to people that we really are under attack, you'll know them by their fruits.
[01:21:55.158 --> 01:21:57.280]  Look at all the people we've woken up through you, the listeners.
[01:21:57.600 --> 01:21:59.963]  Look at what we've done, look at the success we've had.
[01:22:01.092 --> 01:22:05.233]  And then look at just the unprecedented attacks that we are under.
[01:22:06.034 --> 01:22:27.721]  I mean, it is just absolutely... I mean, if I tried to... I mean, there are... I've probably seen more than 50 accounts, and I'm not even looking for them, and people all over ABC and Houston Chronicle and every other website saying, I'm Alex Jones, I hate n-words, and, you know, I'm Alex Jones, or stuff that looks like it's serious, or... and it just goes on and on and on.
[01:22:28.082 --> 01:22:28.822]  And this is criminal!
[01:22:29.707 --> 01:22:39.095]  To go say, I'm Alex Jones, I'm a reporter, and I want you to go out, and I want you to kill people, and I'm going to pay you money.
[01:22:39.275 --> 01:22:45.380]  But see, in reality, Michael Reagan does that and says, kill these 9-11 truthers, kill Mark Dice, I'll pay for it.
[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:47.042]  He doesn't get in trouble.
[01:22:47.682 --> 01:22:52.947]  Then they hold it out and say, I said kill Michelle Malkin, which has proven I didn't, and then now they're creating fake accounts.
[01:22:54.318 --> 01:22:58.383]  Guys, in the military that are doing this, your mama's gonna lose her pension fund.
[01:22:58.403 --> 01:22:58.923]  So are you.
[01:22:59.644 --> 01:23:01.226]  I'm gonna skip this break for InfoWars listeners.
[01:23:02.107 --> 01:23:04.169]  I'm really trying to help you, even if you don't know that.
[01:23:04.489 --> 01:23:04.810]  Here we go.
[01:23:06.622 --> 01:23:12.385]  You get these young guys who've been in Iraq, and they're sergeants by now, a lot of them.
[01:23:12.465 --> 01:23:14.286]  They've taken millions of dollars in payoffs.
[01:23:14.326 --> 01:23:14.846]  That's admitted.
[01:23:14.886 --> 01:23:18.968]  Billions are flown in every week, given to the troops as payoffs to commit crimes.
[01:23:19.388 --> 01:23:20.629]  They pay off the local governments.
[01:23:20.949 --> 01:23:23.350]  They've paid off local governments here in the U.S., not just Iraq.
[01:23:23.870 --> 01:23:26.371]  And they come back, and they do this in their little CENTCOM areas.
[01:23:28.012 --> 01:23:30.434]  And they're really trying to flood the web right now.
[01:23:30.494 --> 01:23:32.195]  Lieberman's saying shut the web down.
[01:23:33.316 --> 01:23:37.339]  Europe's voting to try to shut large sectors of it down in the next few days.
[01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:39.841]  They're attacking it from hundreds of angles.
[01:23:40.902 --> 01:23:46.446]  And in Europe they're trying to pass something about how you've got to have an ID or your name, who you are on the web.
[01:23:46.946 --> 01:23:49.848]  See, that sounds great, but that's all going to be selectively enforced.
[01:23:50.168 --> 01:24:01.034]  And they use examples like this, this terrorism that's going on, against legislators and others with people on the web posing as them, posing as me, and other prominent people, to go after them.
[01:24:01.054 --> 01:24:02.115]  But you always notice who it is.
[01:24:02.195 --> 01:24:08.159]  It's patriots, anti-New World Order, it's liberals who are against the war, it's real conservatives who are against open borders.
[01:24:08.979 --> 01:24:11.621]  You know, a hundred fake sites will be put up that look real,
[01:24:12.475 --> 01:24:29.515]  Where, uh, you know, it'll have a congressman who's against open borders for sovereignty issues and security issues saying, you know, things like, you know, I'm congressman such and such and I hate black people and I hate, uh, you know, and they'll use racist terms for Mexicans or Latinos.
[01:24:30.911 --> 01:24:33.192]  It's just every dirty trick in the book.
[01:24:33.232 --> 01:24:38.753]  They are just pulling out all the stops for whatever's coming here in the next few months, next year.
[01:24:39.254 --> 01:24:40.274]  And just God help us.
[01:24:40.674 --> 01:24:42.735]  I keep telling you the last six months, man, don't you feel it?
[01:24:42.755 --> 01:24:44.615]  Don't you feel the big financial collapse coming?
[01:24:44.955 --> 01:24:46.116]  Don't you feel war coming?
[01:24:46.636 --> 01:24:47.676]  And just God help us.
[01:24:47.736 --> 01:24:55.338]  They are really trying to create just a fog of war, a fog of disinfo, and intimidate people to go, well, I don't want to go create a website.
[01:24:55.418 --> 01:24:58.479]  I don't want to go on the web and do stuff.
[01:24:58.499 --> 01:24:59.780]  They'll create fake accounts of me.
[01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:02.121]  If you don't, they're going to win.
[01:25:02.181 --> 01:25:05.503]  We need more people to show their faces, more people to come online.
[01:25:05.723 --> 01:25:07.704]  We need more people to speak out and say no.
[01:25:08.224 --> 01:25:13.767]  And we need all you info lawyers who've spent an hour or two fighting the info war online, we need you to spend four or five hours a day.
[01:25:14.387 --> 01:25:18.689]  Quit watching your favorite sitcom, don't go get drunk with your buddies, or don't go fishing this weekend.
[01:25:19.009 --> 01:25:23.552]  We need you to fight the info war, also physically call in and talk radio, do an access show.
[01:25:24.552 --> 01:25:25.913]  Now is the time to shine.
[01:25:26.554 --> 01:25:27.995]  Now is the time to get the word out.
[01:25:28.516 --> 01:25:32.259]  Tomorrow I'll air the last 15 minutes of that Donahue piece and analyze it.
[01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:36.102]  I was going to air that, but during the break I've been looking at all these.
[01:25:36.122 --> 01:25:46.892]  Yeah, there's going to have to be an investigation of this, and they will just... It's just incredible what they're doing here.
[01:25:48.375 --> 01:25:56.261]  And it's like people on here going, Alex Jones, you're a terrorist, I've reported you to YouTube, FBI, Homeland Security, Secret Service, CIA, they're going to get you.
[01:25:58.863 --> 01:26:03.366]  And it just goes on, you've got idiots in there agreeing, I agree with Alex, let's get O'Reilly.
[01:26:04.087 --> 01:26:09.311]  And then it'll be in the news, Alex Jones says it, and the news will show up and I'll say I didn't say it, and they'll go, isn't this you?
[01:26:10.091 --> 01:26:13.814]  But see, they know it isn't me, but they know the public's dumbed down and not really paying attention.
[01:26:14.014 --> 01:26:14.335]  Here we go.
[01:26:25.453 --> 01:26:28.714]  But he can play the guitar just like he's ringing a bell!
[01:26:28.955 --> 01:26:29.455]  Let's it go!
[01:26:29.615 --> 01:26:31.936]  Oh my God, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:26:55.455 --> 01:26:57.217]  You know, it's actually a great blessing.
[01:26:57.237 --> 01:26:59.719]  It is!
[01:26:59.779 --> 01:27:08.889]  It's a blessing to have hundreds of fake websites being created where they're falsely claiming that I'm calling for the murder of media figures and other people.
[01:27:10.671 --> 01:27:11.972]  And the death threats are a blessing.
[01:27:12.973 --> 01:27:16.497]  It is all a blessing because it means that I'm doing my job.
[01:27:17.588 --> 01:27:25.236]  It means we're warning people about the deadly vaccines, we're warning them about the mercury, we're warning them about the poisons in the water, the fluoride, other things.
[01:27:25.877 --> 01:27:29.862]  And governments are saying, people aren't taking shots anymore, we've got to ban the freedom on the internet!
[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:33.002]  You know, they're actually saying, 9-11 Truth is taking over!
[01:27:33.282 --> 01:27:34.163]  We've got to ban them!
[01:27:34.824 --> 01:27:39.368]  Now, that's what they say in the halls of Congress, in Parliament, in Europe, and with big U.N.
[01:27:39.488 --> 01:27:40.529]  meetings they have this week.
[01:27:40.549 --> 01:27:41.269]  It's all official.
[01:27:41.650 --> 01:27:49.817]  But then they go on the Internet and tell us, oh, your 9-11 Truth's dead, and suddenly from hundreds of different areas, it's, you know, from the establishment, from the Patriot movement.
[01:27:50.317 --> 01:27:50.678]  9-11's dead!
[01:27:50.698 --> 01:27:51.478]  9-11's dead!
[01:27:51.498 --> 01:27:52.479]  9-11's dead!
[01:27:52.499 --> 01:27:53.800]  Oh, you lost it, I tell you!
[01:27:53.820 --> 01:27:54.481]  Nobody cares!
[01:27:54.501 --> 01:27:55.582]  Nobody's believing you!
[01:27:55.842 --> 01:28:05.570]  Forget all these government officials, and Hollywood people, and music stars, and scientists and physicists going public, and people waking up to false flag terror, and mainstream news reporting on Cheney winning a state's terror attacks.
[01:28:05.850 --> 01:28:06.631]  None of that matters!
[01:28:06.651 --> 01:28:07.251]  9-11's dead!
[01:28:07.271 --> 01:28:07.932]  9-11's dead!
[01:28:07.952 --> 01:28:08.652]  9-11's dead!
[01:28:10.053 --> 01:28:14.197]  And they are just going absolutely hog-wild right now.
[01:28:18.697 --> 01:28:19.678]  You know what's going to happen?
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:26.184]  People that have discernment are going to find out that this is not Alex Jones on the web.
[01:28:26.864 --> 01:28:31.588]  Then they're going to notice that people are claiming I'm anti-semitic, or I'm a Catholic secret agent, or all these lies.
[01:28:31.929 --> 01:28:39.195]  They're going to see all that disinfo with this, where they have my face up there with the caption up there to go after Bill O'Reilly.
[01:28:39.335 --> 01:28:41.758]  To kill him, is what they're saying, I'm saying.
[01:28:42.398 --> 01:28:48.410]  In my name with a clone of a popular Alex Jones channel that gets millions of views a month that isn't even mine.
[01:28:48.490 --> 01:28:49.412]  Somebody just set it up.
[01:28:49.652 --> 01:28:53.780]  The person offered it to us and I'm just like, I don't have the personnel to control that or run that.
[01:28:54.650 --> 01:29:00.133]  Now I've got to worry that talk show hosts and people that I know behind the scenes have attacked me will try to go over to that channel and get on it.
[01:29:00.553 --> 01:29:02.014]  I just don't have time to mess with this stuff.
[01:29:03.534 --> 01:29:05.435]  Maybe we should ask that person to give us that channel.
[01:29:05.776 --> 01:29:09.197]  The point is, is that this over here is a clone of that.
[01:29:09.257 --> 01:29:11.018]  But there's hundreds of these.
[01:29:11.078 --> 01:29:11.939]  I mean, I've seen more than 50.
[01:29:12.179 --> 01:29:16.121]  And people are telling me they're just everywhere, you know, saying this.
[01:29:17.862 --> 01:29:22.085]  But see, even those that get galled into this are later going to find out it's a lie.
[01:29:22.486 --> 01:29:32.713]  Maybe a month, maybe a year, and then feel foolish, and now they will have the palate, or the acumen, or the discernment in the future, and they'll say, my God, this guy's the real deal!
[01:29:34.034 --> 01:29:41.760]  Because, you know, people creating mass-detailed, you know, 50-something-plus fake websites that took a lot of time and energy apiece, that's not one person.
[01:29:41.780 --> 01:29:42.641]  That's not ten people.
[01:29:43.632 --> 01:29:44.793]  And I mean, this is every day.
[01:29:44.853 --> 01:29:47.575]  This is concerted attack that this radio show is under.
[01:29:49.356 --> 01:29:56.102]  And I become a maniac sometimes because of the pressure of it all, but I just trust in God to refill me with energy every single day.
[01:29:59.184 --> 01:30:00.125]  That's what it's all about.
[01:30:00.165 --> 01:30:02.647]  And the good thing about this is, I'm fully committed.
[01:30:03.707 --> 01:30:04.708]  A hundred and ten percent.
[01:30:05.549 --> 01:30:06.490]  I'm not turning around.
[01:30:06.530 --> 01:30:07.410]  I'm not going back.
[01:30:08.091 --> 01:30:10.252]  I'm not ever quitting.
[01:30:11.095 --> 01:30:12.496]  And so, you don't quit either.
[01:30:13.137 --> 01:30:23.265]  Spread the word like you never have before, and we can expose how they're imploding the economy, how they're setting up martial law, how major army brigades, according to mainstream news, are going to be occupying the U.S.
[01:30:23.786 --> 01:30:28.710]  They're making the move right now, folks, and they're going after who they see as the head of the movement.
[01:30:29.702 --> 01:30:33.126]  Okay, and I never really wanted to be that, but by fiat I am.
[01:30:33.226 --> 01:30:37.490]  Regardless, retransmission starts now at one place, InfoWars.com.
[01:30:37.510 --> 01:30:41.414]  I have Steve Quayle on, Ralph Nader for 30 minutes in the first hour coming up right now.
[01:30:41.794 --> 01:30:44.297]  Key analysis at InfoWars.com right now.
[01:30:44.337 --> 01:30:44.997]  God bless you all.
[01:30:45.018 --> 01:30:46.139]  See you tomorrow for everybody else.
