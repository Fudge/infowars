[00:00:05.091 --> 00:00:09.936]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.936 --> 00:00:11.518]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.518 --> 00:00:13.080]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.264]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.264 --> 00:00:21.349]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.061]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:34.061 --> 00:00:36.521]  Welcome and thank you for joining us.
[00:00:36.521 --> 00:00:42.283]  It is December 4th, 2008 on this Thursday edition.
[00:00:42.283 --> 00:00:46.485]  I will tell you we have a surprise guest in studio tomorrow and just leave it at that.
[00:00:46.485 --> 00:00:49.406]  You know how I love surprises.
[00:00:49.406 --> 00:00:55.208]  We have several informative guests joining us coming up later in the day.
[00:00:55.208 --> 00:00:58.689]  Professor Jeffrey F. Atticott, remember about a year ago?
[00:00:58.689 --> 00:01:01.950]  I debated him on CBS TV in San Antonio.
[00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.632]  About how, well, there's not really a plan to put troops on the streets of America for law enforcement.
[00:01:08.632 --> 00:01:13.214]  No, and there's not a plan to get rid of the National Guard and federalize them.
[00:01:13.214 --> 00:01:15.294]  No, everything's fine.
[00:01:15.294 --> 00:01:18.956]  Mr. Jones is paranoid.
[00:01:18.956 --> 00:01:19.996]  Now it's all been announced.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:28.885]  So, Professor Jeffrey F. Atticott is bravely joining us coming up in 30 minutes here on the show, because he is at St.
[00:01:28.885 --> 00:01:37.291]  Mary's University School of Law in San Antonio, Distinguished Professor of, Director of the Center for Terrorism Law.
[00:01:37.291 --> 00:01:45.216]  And he is very, very prominent in all of this new form of law that really isn't new, it's quite Napoleonic.
[00:01:45.216 --> 00:01:46.677]  Practiced similar law in China.
[00:01:48.317 --> 00:01:49.618]  And in Stalinist Russia.
[00:01:49.618 --> 00:01:56.305]  So we'll be going over all of that today with him here on the air.
[00:01:56.305 --> 00:02:07.074]  And if you don't think secret military commissions and waterboarding and trips on the streets isn't Napoleonic, you don't know what Napoleonic law is.
[00:02:07.074 --> 00:02:10.297]  It's guilty until proven innocence.
[00:02:10.297 --> 00:02:11.899]  It is the state is God.
[00:02:14.281 --> 00:02:20.063]  Just dressed up in neocon and Obama-esque neolib clothing.
[00:02:20.063 --> 00:02:33.107]  And then we do have Major General Stubblebine joining us from Central America along with his wife Dr. Labo today.
[00:02:33.107 --> 00:02:36.288]  So that is coming up.
[00:02:36.288 --> 00:02:40.889]  Also for 30 minutes coming up at the bottom of the next hour we're going to have
[00:02:42.578 --> 00:02:50.920]  Our weekly report on the economy from Bob Chapman and the International Forecaster.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:03:00.243]  It turns out that anti-terror police in London last week arrested, detained, kidnapped, they didn't have a warrant under common law.
[00:03:00.243 --> 00:03:09.385]  That was a kidnapping, official oppression, and that's not Alex Jones saying that, that's the Speaker of the Parliament now saying that.
[00:03:11.744 --> 00:03:17.869]  And they arrested him under terrorism auspices for what?
[00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:31.841]  Exposing that the government was secretly legalizing all of the illegal aliens in England while lying to the public and telling them they had to accept national ID cards to stop the illegal aliens.
[00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:34.263]  And so what'd they do?
[00:03:34.263 --> 00:03:40.388]  They went and busted into his house and stole all his computers and files and interrogated him
[00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.915]  For nine hours before even letting anyone know that he'd been grabbed.
[00:03:45.915 --> 00:03:54.004]  Of course, he was the shadow secretary of immigration.
[00:03:54.004 --> 00:03:55.425]  What is a shadow secretary?
[00:03:55.425 --> 00:04:01.913]  In the parliamentary system, the second strongest party, the Conservatives, which he's a member of, then get a shadow secretary.
[00:04:01.913 --> 00:04:03.074]  They get representation.
[00:04:05.243 --> 00:04:11.585]  Uh, they're in the office, so he witnessed all these criminal activities going on, and they are criminal, violating all these laws.
[00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:14.645]  I mean, it came out, what, six years ago?
[00:04:14.645 --> 00:04:23.427]  In the BBC, even, that Tony Blair had secretly legalized over a million immigrants in the first couple years of his administration.
[00:04:23.427 --> 00:04:25.868]  It's been in since 96.
[00:04:25.868 --> 00:04:27.608]  Been out since last year.
[00:04:27.608 --> 00:04:29.009]  Gordon Brown's in now.
[00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:30.549]  Same policies.
[00:04:30.549 --> 00:04:34.450]  Secret deals with the European Union to load the illegal aliens on the trains to bring them in.
[00:04:37.154 --> 00:04:41.923]  That's a big deal when governments are grabbing government officials without even warrants.
[00:04:41.923 --> 00:04:44.328]  I mean powerful government officials.
[00:04:44.328 --> 00:04:46.792]  See, the illegitimate paramilitary government...
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.080]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.181]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:04:53.181 --> 00:04:55.482]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:04:55.482 --> 00:04:58.922]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:04:58.922 --> 00:04:59.923]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome
[00:05:15.086 --> 00:05:19.509]  And begged for FEMA to take care of your family, in any emergency, if you simply prepare.
[00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:25.313]  Our elected representatives wanted a good ol' boy bailout for the special interest, so they ignored your screams not to do it.
[00:05:25.313 --> 00:05:27.134]  They turned off the telephones and email.
[00:05:27.134 --> 00:05:31.116]  They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air.
[00:05:31.116 --> 00:05:33.938]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[00:05:33.938 --> 00:05:42.724]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities, particularly food, beyond many Americans' reach.
[00:05:43.064 --> 00:05:50.150]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days, until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.613]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast, there seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[00:05:54.613 --> 00:06:00.298]  The private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[00:06:00.298 --> 00:06:03.540]  The stores have less food, but jack up prices to stay in business.
[00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.683]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[00:06:06.883 --> 00:06:08.704]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[00:06:08.704 --> 00:06:12.786]  One-third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[00:06:12.786 --> 00:06:16.928]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food.
[00:06:16.928 --> 00:06:24.452]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the new old order, has a lot less control over you.
[00:06:24.452 --> 00:06:28.374]  And so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[00:06:28.374 --> 00:06:31.256]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:06:31.616 --> 00:06:38.598]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:06:38.598 --> 00:06:41.879]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:42.799]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:06:42.799 --> 00:06:47.020]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.

[00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:05.791]  Take action today.
[00:07:05.791 --> 00:07:08.853]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:07:08.853 --> 00:07:14.238]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:14.238 --> 00:07:19.362]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:07:19.362 --> 00:07:22.825]  Chrysler executives, failure could spark depression.
[00:07:24.261 --> 00:07:29.304]  Harvard hit by loss as crisis spreads to colleges.
[00:07:29.304 --> 00:07:31.385]  Prepare for depression level unemployment.
[00:07:31.385 --> 00:07:32.366]  That's another headline.
[00:07:32.366 --> 00:07:35.428]  These are all mainstream.
[00:07:35.428 --> 00:07:37.289]  Israel plans for solo attack on Iran.
[00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:38.389]  Neocon still preparing for Iran attack.
[00:07:38.389 --> 00:07:39.170]  Pakistan TV channel says the
[00:07:53.766 --> 00:07:56.208]  Attacks in India hatched by Hindu Zionists.
[00:07:56.208 --> 00:07:58.391]  That's the Times of India.
[00:07:58.391 --> 00:08:00.252]  Article on this subject by Steve Watson.
[00:08:00.252 --> 00:08:04.657]  Pakistani security consultant calls Mumbai attacks a botched false flag.
[00:08:04.657 --> 00:08:08.801]  CFR Brookings to dominate Obama's strategy.
[00:08:08.801 --> 00:08:16.228]  UPI is reporting that Brookings openly is bragging that the Council on Foreign Relations is already running the White House, as if they haven't always been.
[00:08:17.071 --> 00:08:18.232]  In modern history.
[00:08:18.232 --> 00:08:22.875]  It took 90 minutes for the Daily News to steal the Empire State's building, Daily News.
[00:08:22.875 --> 00:08:29.059]  I meant to get to this yesterday, because this is what Patriot mythology groups do.
[00:08:29.059 --> 00:08:37.305]  They file bogus papers through common law, and then engage in all sorts of havoc.
[00:08:37.305 --> 00:08:40.547]  And then, of course, they always end up going to prison or jail or getting indicted.
[00:08:40.547 --> 00:08:42.549]  But the scam just goes on.
[00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:43.830]  It's delusional.
[00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.571]  And it's destroying common law.
[00:08:46.377 --> 00:08:50.260]  And the power of common law and the system is using it to discredit common law.
[00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:56.023]  So I'm going to talk more about the cancer of the Patriot Mythology groups.
[00:08:56.023 --> 00:09:05.149]  I mean, I've been doing this a long time, folks, and I'm just so sick of trying to explain this to people I know personally here in Austin, and they just won't listen.
[00:09:05.149 --> 00:09:10.353]  They're like, what does Patriot Mythology have to do with the Empire State's building stolen in 90 minutes?
[00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:19.971]  Well, because you, your word of honor as a free man is extremely powerful.
[00:09:19.971 --> 00:09:22.191]  This has been a free society.
[00:09:22.191 --> 00:09:24.192]  More free than any other nation on earth.
[00:09:24.192 --> 00:09:27.714]  At least for select groups, white males.
[00:09:27.714 --> 00:09:31.375]  But that, that liberty could be extended to all.
[00:09:31.375 --> 00:09:35.677]  But instead, all were enslaved.
[00:09:35.677 --> 00:09:36.797]  After the Civil War.
[00:09:36.797 --> 00:09:39.459]  Rights became privileges, we became wards of the states.
[00:09:39.459 --> 00:09:39.799]  13th Amendment.
[00:09:39.799 --> 00:09:40.179]  14th Amendment.
[00:09:43.962 --> 00:09:44.983]  But I'm digressing here.
[00:09:44.983 --> 00:09:49.526]  I just wanted to read headlines and get back into them, but I just looked at this article.
[00:09:49.526 --> 00:09:57.772]  They went and filed deed paperwork and swore to it, the courthouse, and they said, here, Empire State's building's yours.
[00:09:57.772 --> 00:10:05.037]  Now, the point is, is that you go to prison for doing that later.
[00:10:05.037 --> 00:10:13.563]  But, if somebody tries to steal your house, a lot of people don't know their rights and so don't know how to defend themselves.
[00:10:14.355 --> 00:10:25.646]  I'm also sick of seeing Patriot groups, different Patriot quote leaders in the past, shysters, who show up and get people get involved in trust and then make them the trust officer.
[00:10:25.646 --> 00:10:27.448]  I'll give you a little tip.
[00:10:27.448 --> 00:10:32.433]  Never set up a trust with somebody who says they're going to make themselves the trust officer.
[00:10:32.433 --> 00:10:33.634]  Then they take people's property.
[00:10:34.525 --> 00:10:34.865]  I don't know.
[00:10:34.865 --> 00:10:50.209]  I mean, I've kind of got a burr under my saddle about this because it really got bad about nine, ten years ago, and people kind of woke up to the scam, and then now it's come back around with new shysters, and I have to hear it constantly, and I want them to know this.
[00:10:50.209 --> 00:10:51.269]  I'm going to set up a proper guest.
[00:10:51.269 --> 00:10:56.150]  I'm going to do the proper research, but in the months to come, I am coming after you, okay?
[00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:59.531]  I'm not just going to fight corrupt police and corrupt government.
[00:10:59.531 --> 00:11:00.951]  I'm sick of our own house.
[00:11:04.235 --> 00:11:15.900]  Being, being, being, being, being defiled and trashed by people operating under the flag of freedom and liberty.
[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.561]  The whole society is imploding, folks.
[00:11:18.561 --> 00:11:19.901]  Corruption is everywhere.
[00:11:19.901 --> 00:11:20.782]  Watch yourselves.
[00:11:20.782 --> 00:11:24.463]  Be careful.
[00:11:24.463 --> 00:11:24.783]  You know what?
[00:11:24.783 --> 00:11:28.785]  Since I'm on this, I'll just get to this now that I've got all this other news.
[00:11:28.785 --> 00:11:29.345]  Just briefly.
[00:11:30.544 --> 00:11:35.866]  It took 90 minutes for Daily News to steal the Empire State's building.
[00:11:35.866 --> 00:11:43.229]  In one of the biggest heists in American history, the Daily News stole the two billion Empire State building.
[00:11:43.229 --> 00:11:44.870]  And it wasn't that hard.
[00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:58.916]  The news swiped the 102 story Art Deco skyscraper by drawing up a batch of bogus documents, making a fake notary stamp, and filing paperwork with the city to transfer the deed to the property.
[00:12:01.593 --> 00:12:04.074]  Now see, they faked this.
[00:12:04.074 --> 00:12:09.016]  You could actually go in and swear it was you with a fake document and get it.
[00:12:09.016 --> 00:12:27.965]  And see, it is fake when somebody declares, I am really the owner of the Federal Reserve, as a sovereign of the United States, under oak leaves, with a flag, without a fringe, and then you speak magic mumbo-jumbo, and then you go file a lie.
[00:12:27.965 --> 00:12:28.605]  That's all that is.
[00:12:30.555 --> 00:12:37.358]  Some of the information was laughable because they wanted to make it clear that nobody's even reading these filings.
[00:12:37.358 --> 00:12:48.982]  Original King Kong star is listed as a witness, Fay Wray.
[00:12:48.982 --> 00:12:57.926]  The name shared by the bank, Robert Willie Sutton, the bank robber, Willie Sutton, and it just goes on and on.
[00:12:59.241 --> 00:13:08.044]  And then they were able to file it and get ownership of the Empire States Building in 90 minutes.
[00:13:08.044 --> 00:13:11.745]  That's how long it took the paperwork to go through.
[00:13:11.745 --> 00:13:13.406]  So I want to explain to people again.
[00:13:13.406 --> 00:13:27.451]  Some shyster comes along and says give me $5,000 and I can file paperwork or show you how to esponge all your debts or to put liens on people.
[00:13:27.451 --> 00:13:27.951]  It's a scam.
[00:13:29.281 --> 00:13:32.283]  You're gonna go to jail.
[00:13:32.283 --> 00:13:40.310]  And I really think a lot of these are just government operatives, and they're doing this to so corrupt the common law and the court system to where they totally abolish it.
[00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:44.533]  And then that's basically what the New York Daily News is calling for.
[00:13:44.533 --> 00:13:48.696]  You see how they're doing this?
[00:13:48.696 --> 00:13:56.823]  And I don't like our movement, and again, it's many movements, it's people that don't trust the government, don't trust the mainstream media, that disagree with what the government's doing.
[00:13:57.868 --> 00:14:00.409]  The alternative movement, the awakening movement.
[00:14:00.409 --> 00:14:02.910]  You know, there's a thousand groups in there.
[00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:09.113]  But the media will use this and point at us with this, and I'm digressing.
[00:14:09.113 --> 00:14:16.217]  I've seen so many people lose their houses and get in trouble with all this.
[00:14:16.217 --> 00:14:23.620]  There's even groups that will advertise themselves as regular debt relief, as reasonable debt relief, and a good organization.
[00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:25.801]  Then they bait and switch when you actually call them.
[00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:32.445]  And the world's complex, it's a big place, and I can't even keep track of it all.
[00:14:32.445 --> 00:14:36.268]  I'll just tell you this, if it looks too good to be true, it is.
[00:14:36.268 --> 00:14:39.030]  There's no free lunch.
[00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:42.012]  Okay?
[00:14:42.012 --> 00:14:43.393]  Now, is the government fraudulent?
[00:14:43.393 --> 00:14:48.217]  Is it breaking the common law, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, engaging in all sorts of fraud and corruption?
[00:14:48.217 --> 00:14:49.218]  Absolutely.
[00:14:49.218 --> 00:14:50.359]  But it's force majeure.
[00:14:50.359 --> 00:14:51.800]  Force majeure.
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.101]  It is the overwhelming force.
[00:14:53.101 --> 00:14:53.942]  They are criminal.
[00:14:53.942 --> 00:14:54.783]  They will enforce.
[00:14:58.223 --> 00:15:06.725]  You know, I hear Larry Becraft criticized all the time because he's able to win in court over and over again for people on IRS cases.
[00:15:06.725 --> 00:15:14.046]  And they go, well, he does it with technicalities and with the Constitution and with the fact that they're not following proper procedure.
[00:15:14.046 --> 00:15:20.967]  He's not doing it, you know, in that the IRS is a fraudulent, you know, private collection agency of the private Federal Reserve.
[00:15:20.967 --> 00:15:22.828]  Well, those arguments never work!
[00:15:22.828 --> 00:15:24.188]  No one's ever won under that.
[00:15:26.698 --> 00:15:30.259]  You can criticize the lawyer, Cryer, or Becraft, or any of them.
[00:15:30.259 --> 00:15:30.479]  Why?
[00:15:30.479 --> 00:15:32.240]  Because they win?
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.701]  They discredit the criminal IRS?
[00:15:34.701 --> 00:15:36.141]  Again, more COINTELPRO, folks.
[00:15:36.141 --> 00:15:42.124]  That's all it is.
[00:15:42.124 --> 00:15:44.104]  I'm way off in left field on this, most listeners.
[00:15:44.104 --> 00:15:45.705]  This is such a wide audience.
[00:15:45.705 --> 00:15:48.386]  You already know what I'm talking about.
[00:15:48.386 --> 00:15:49.646]  But that's why I'm discussing it.
[00:15:49.646 --> 00:15:53.728]  Because as you get deeper into the Liberty Movement, you need to understand the pitfalls.
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:01.264]  But if you're in a mall shopping mall parking lot, you better understand the pitfalls that crimes explode.
[00:16:01.264 --> 00:16:04.626]  When you drink fluoride water out of the tap, you better understand the pitfalls.
[00:16:04.626 --> 00:16:10.010]  I just have an instinct to want to warn people about dangers and things that are going on out there.
[00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:15.634]  Alright, that's coming up later.
[00:16:15.634 --> 00:16:18.756]  Earlier, in the first segment, I mentioned
[00:16:23.897 --> 00:16:37.002]  The fact that they arrested the government minister of immigration in England, secretly last week, under terrorism powers.
[00:16:37.002 --> 00:16:39.823]  And they did it without a warrant.
[00:16:39.823 --> 00:16:41.644]  And now the Parliament is making a big deal out of it.
[00:16:41.644 --> 00:16:44.705]  I'm going to play that later, because it is a big deal.
[00:16:44.705 --> 00:16:47.126]  And that dovetails with what's happening here in the United States.
[00:16:48.121 --> 00:16:53.085]  And in Europe, they're arresting a bunch of reporters in France and other places for just criticizing Sarkozy.
[00:16:53.085 --> 00:16:54.967]  Criticizing Merkel.
[00:16:54.967 --> 00:16:57.149]  They are setting up open tyranny.
[00:16:57.149 --> 00:17:02.513]  It's starting to happen, folks.
[00:17:02.513 --> 00:17:05.656]  And we're seeing reporters, hundreds of them, arrested in the U.S.
[00:17:05.656 --> 00:17:08.919]  for refusing to give up sources, when that's always been protected.
[00:17:10.575 --> 00:17:25.478]  They are attacking, the establishment is attacking, the sacrosanct, guarded, honored institution of the press that is enshrined in the First Amendment.
[00:17:25.478 --> 00:17:29.559]  I had Taser International send me a threatening letter about writing articles criticizing Taser.
[00:17:29.559 --> 00:17:32.060]  I just called their lawyer up here, Stanley, and I said, buddy, I'm gonna come after you.
[00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:36.321]  And he said, oh, just forget it, it's okay, fine, just forget it, everything's fine.
[00:17:36.321 --> 00:17:37.101]  See, it's all about
[00:17:38.169 --> 00:17:39.430]  What they can get away with.
[00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:41.272]  I called that guy and I said, let's go!
[00:17:41.272 --> 00:17:45.555]  Let's go!
[00:17:45.555 --> 00:17:52.500]  I'm not saying bring it on, but you bring first blood on me, you come swinging at me, I'm gonna come back swinging.
[00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:53.982]  I'm tired of this crap!
[00:17:53.982 --> 00:17:56.303]  Excuse me.
[00:17:56.303 --> 00:17:58.685]  Trying to intimidate our First Amendment.
[00:17:58.685 --> 00:17:59.746]  It ain't happening!
[00:17:59.746 --> 00:18:04.410]  This is the United States of America, and you people may think it isn't, but it is.
[00:18:12.463 --> 00:18:13.864]  This is our country!
[00:18:13.864 --> 00:18:15.745]  Not yours!
[00:18:15.745 --> 00:18:16.686]  We run this country!
[00:18:16.686 --> 00:18:17.507]  We're the people!
[00:18:17.507 --> 00:18:19.028]  I don't care what you claim!
[00:18:19.028 --> 00:18:25.492]  I don't care if you claim government's God and that troops running around with microwave guns and machine guns working with the police is freedom!
[00:18:25.492 --> 00:18:26.593]  We know it isn't!
[00:18:26.593 --> 00:18:32.337]  And we're going to tell everybody else it isn't freedom!
[00:18:32.337 --> 00:18:34.459]  Meanwhile, what's going on in England?
[00:18:34.459 --> 00:18:36.080]  London musicians must give police
[00:18:37.561 --> 00:18:41.124]  Massive amounts of personal information performed live.
[00:18:41.124 --> 00:18:45.727]  Now they're claiming for basically public speaking, any event, playing music.
[00:18:45.727 --> 00:18:50.691]  You've got to go register with the police and get authorization from them to meet and gather.
[00:18:50.691 --> 00:18:52.312]  In main venues.
[00:18:52.312 --> 00:18:53.493]  See?
[00:18:53.493 --> 00:19:00.198]  A massive attack on free speech, on the Magna Carta, on the First Amendment.
[00:19:00.198 --> 00:19:01.219]  You understand, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:19:01.219 --> 00:19:03.941]  I've got another one here.
[00:19:03.941 --> 00:19:04.962]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:19:04.962 --> 00:19:06.043]  Wait till you hear this.
[00:19:09.275 --> 00:19:12.077]  Toxic heavy metals negatively impact our health.
[00:19:12.077 --> 00:19:17.622]  They're in the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, the products we use, and the objects we touch.
[00:19:17.622 --> 00:19:19.644]  Exposure is impossible to avoid.
[00:19:19.644 --> 00:19:23.767]  Heavy metals build up within the body over a period of time, causing poor health.
[00:19:23.767 --> 00:19:28.171]  However, with KiloRacks, they can be mobilized and excreted in a safe and effective manner.
[00:19:28.451 --> 00:19:28.931]  I think so.
[00:19:48.456 --> 00:19:48.716]  Thank you.
[00:20:09.105 --> 00:20:15.847]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:20:15.847 --> 00:20:18.488]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:20:18.488 --> 00:20:20.049]  But who is the enemy?
[00:20:20.049 --> 00:20:20.829]  Bin Laden.
[00:20:20.829 --> 00:20:21.889]  This is his MO.
[00:20:21.889 --> 00:20:23.230]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:24.650]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:32.354]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:20:32.354 --> 00:20:32.814]  Some U.S.
[00:20:32.814 --> 00:20:39.177]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:20:39.177 --> 00:20:42.639]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:20:42.939 --> 00:20:53.141]  In Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:20:53.141 --> 00:20:54.381]  Fabled enemies.
[00:20:54.381 --> 00:21:01.903]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:21:01.903 --> 00:21:05.484]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[00:21:09.162 --> 00:21:14.646]  The holiday season is here again, a time to appreciate our friends and family and the many blessings we have.
[00:21:14.646 --> 00:21:17.748]  It's also time to find unique gift ideas for those we love.
[00:21:17.748 --> 00:21:20.910]  This year, why not give a gift that saves your loved ones money?
[00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:25.753]  A 2-ounce bottle of fuel conditioner from Fuel Saver Technologies makes a great stocking stuffer.
[00:21:25.753 --> 00:21:28.055]  It's also an inexpensive and thoughtful present.
[00:21:28.055 --> 00:21:34.299]  A small squeeze of our product in the gas tank improves combustion, boosting fuel economy 10 to 20% or more.
[00:21:34.299 --> 00:21:38.422]  Completely safe for all engines, our fuel additive also reduces emissions,
[00:21:39.022 --> 00:21:39.502]  That's right!
[00:22:08.803 --> 00:22:12.644]  Do you take nutritional supplements but don't notice any benefits?
[00:22:12.644 --> 00:22:24.729]  The problem is today's supplements contain things like DL-alpha-tocopherol, a synthetic form of vitamin E derived from petroleum, or ferrous fumarate, an inorganic form of iron that can actually damage your body.
[00:22:24.729 --> 00:22:29.411]  Most of today's vitamin and mineral supplements are actually stressing your liver and kidneys.
[00:22:29.411 --> 00:22:30.591]  Find out what nutritionist
[00:22:30.771 --> 00:22:34.013]  Stephen Huer has learned from 30 years of extensive research.

[00:22:38.716 --> 00:22:48.502]  So if you suffer from addictions, low energy, depression, low libido, poor sleep, digestive problems, allergies, slow healing, cancer, or just feel lousy, he can help.

[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:22.842]  What's happening is the entire Bill of Rights Constitution in England, the Magna Carta, is being overthrown.
[00:23:22.842 --> 00:23:26.543]  The Magna Carta 1215 became the model of world liberty.
[00:23:26.543 --> 00:23:37.306]  A combination of Anglo-Saxon-Germanic common law and the Mosaic Law, integrated by the scribes in England.
[00:23:39.704 --> 00:23:47.037]  These precious documents were paid for in huge wars and hundreds of thousands dead in England.
[00:23:52.549 --> 00:24:00.653]  Almost 50% of the Parliament voted against the war in 1776 in the United States.
[00:24:00.653 --> 00:24:16.261]  It was patriot spies in England that most assuredly helped win the war against the Crown, as well as spies for the cause of liberty in France.
[00:24:16.261 --> 00:24:19.863]  And if you think you're going to butcher the Bill of Rights and Constitution in Magna Carta,
[00:24:21.169 --> 00:24:25.613]  You've got another thing coming.
[00:24:25.613 --> 00:24:26.874]  Now look at what's happening in England.
[00:24:26.874 --> 00:24:27.735]  This is Steve Watson.
[00:24:27.735 --> 00:24:30.318]  He has links to London Independent.
[00:24:30.318 --> 00:24:32.880]  Original story on this.
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:41.608]  Eight-page form will detail names, aliases, private addresses, phone numbers of all musicians, and ethnic background of the likely audience.
[00:24:41.608 --> 00:24:44.791]  And this is so you get to approve.
[00:24:44.791 --> 00:24:46.953]  And they're also moving, I read more deeply into it,
[00:24:48.297 --> 00:25:00.860]  Form 696 and other similar forms for even speeches, poetry, any public gathering, the police have to, a week before, certify it.
[00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:06.141]  You have to get a license and then that turns a right into a privilege.
[00:25:06.141 --> 00:25:06.941]  What is a license?
[00:25:06.941 --> 00:25:17.903]  It is authorization, a letter of mark, through imperial crown law, through the ancient law of tyrants, to do something that is illegal.
[00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:37.433]  And if we let this go through with the free speech zones and several cities like New York wanting people to get permits to have political rallies inside buildings, quote, for everyone's safety, then it allows them to start regulating and controlling it.
[00:25:37.433 --> 00:25:41.054]  Excellent story at InfoWars.net by Steve Watson.
[00:25:41.054 --> 00:25:47.795]  London musicians must give police huge swaths of personal information to perform live.
[00:25:49.961 --> 00:26:02.027]  Musicians and performers in London will soon be required by law to complete and hand over to police an eight-page form detailing all their personal information and ethnic background of their audience that they want to perform.
[00:26:02.027 --> 00:26:10.371]  Again, making you report all about yourself to be able to even meet and have poetry or music or any other spoken word.
[00:26:10.371 --> 00:26:11.531]  Total tyranny!
[00:26:11.531 --> 00:26:13.272]  The Soviet Union!
[00:26:14.022 --> 00:26:15.523]  Didn't make you do this.
[00:26:15.523 --> 00:26:17.825]  They would just have spies there to see what you said.
[00:26:17.825 --> 00:26:22.930]  They want to find out who's talking, who's singing, who is an artist, who is involved.
[00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:29.755]  They did have this in East Germany, the worst the world's ever seen next to North Korea for oppression.
[00:26:29.755 --> 00:26:33.659]  And of course there were all these pimps, all these fat bureaucrats and pimps.
[00:26:34.474 --> 00:26:42.417]  Who, for theaters, or for TV, or for local poetry, that you'd have to go get certified by to be able to even go speak.
[00:26:42.417 --> 00:26:48.620]  This is the height of cultural tyranny.
[00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:52.502]  And they are proposing similar things here in the United States.
[00:26:52.502 --> 00:26:53.542]  Here's another one.
[00:26:53.542 --> 00:26:56.203]  UK Daily Mail, today.
[00:26:56.203 --> 00:27:02.206]  Big Brother police to get wartime power to demand ID in the street on pain of sending you to jail.
[00:27:02.867 --> 00:27:05.269]  They've already been doing this without law for years.
[00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:11.413]  State officials will be given powers previously reserved in times of war to demand a person's proof of identity at any time.
[00:27:11.413 --> 00:27:16.297]  Remember, they swore the National ID Card wouldn't be used for this.
[00:27:16.297 --> 00:27:24.142]  Anybody who refuses Big Brother demand could face arrest and a possible prison sentence.
[00:27:24.142 --> 00:27:30.727]  They're doing similar things in Australia and the news said, well, that's not too big of a sentence, two years in jail.
[00:27:32.188 --> 00:27:34.690]  What's wrong with that?
[00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:39.553]  The move would effectively take Britain back to World War II when people were stopped and asked to show their papers.
[00:27:39.553 --> 00:27:46.698]  And it says here that this is overall to stop illegal aliens.
[00:27:46.698 --> 00:27:49.880]  Folks, the government secretly legalized over a million of them.
[00:27:52.786 --> 00:27:55.348]  5,000 of them were put in high-level security jobs.
[00:27:55.348 --> 00:27:59.010]  Because tyrannical government likes to bring in foreigners to do this stuff for them.
[00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:04.773]  And then when the minister said this is illegal, they went and arrested him under terrorism.
[00:28:04.773 --> 00:28:09.835]  When he's the boss of the agency, appointed by the elected parliament.
[00:28:09.835 --> 00:28:12.237]  Again, the British government is spying on every member of parliament.
[00:28:12.237 --> 00:28:13.717]  That's been in the news.
[00:28:13.717 --> 00:28:14.898]  It's not the British government.
[00:28:14.898 --> 00:28:20.261]  It is the illegal, old, pre-1215 crown coming back.
[00:28:21.044 --> 00:28:27.566]  When Tony Blair first got elected, I'll never forget the BBC headline, that Magna Carta is dead and he swore to abolish it.
[00:28:27.566 --> 00:28:35.628]  Just an outrageous declaration of tyranny.
[00:28:35.628 --> 00:28:41.430]  And now they want to use troops on the streets of America for, quote, civil insurrection crowd control.
[00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:46.292]  Under federal control, abolishing the state control of the National Guard.
[00:28:46.292 --> 00:28:50.013]  We'll talk about it with somebody on the other side of the issue.
[00:28:50.842 --> 00:28:55.285]  When we get back, PrisonPlanet.com and TruthNews.us are just two of our websites.

[00:31:08.775 --> 00:31:13.679]  Hey GCN listeners, if you're looking for the perfect Christmas gift this year, listen up!
[00:31:13.679 --> 00:31:16.742]  This message is going to make holiday shopping very easy.
[00:31:16.742 --> 00:31:20.685]  This year, give the amazing Survival Seed Bank to friends and family.
[00:31:20.685 --> 00:31:21.526]  Here's why.
[00:31:21.526 --> 00:31:29.553]  The Survival Seed Bank will give any friend or loved one the ability to grow a full acre crisis garden of nutritionally dense, life-sustaining food.
[00:31:29.953 --> 00:31:33.938]  And the Survival Seed Bank is not just a box of open pollinated seeds.
[00:31:33.938 --> 00:31:38.683]  It's an indestructible, waterproof seed bank that can even be buried if necessary.
[00:31:38.683 --> 00:31:40.125]  And here's the best part.
[00:31:40.125 --> 00:31:45.291]  The price of Survival Seed Bank has been drastically reduced for GCN listeners this Christmas.
[00:31:45.291 --> 00:31:47.453]  You might even want to pick one up for yourself.
[00:31:47.453 --> 00:31:49.095]  The price goes back up January 1st.
[00:31:49.155 --> 00:31:49.555]  I think so.
[00:32:14.501 --> 00:32:22.367]  Jeffrey F. Atticott is a distinguished professor of law and the director of the Center for Terrorism Law at St.
[00:32:22.367 --> 00:32:26.931]  Mary's University School of Law, San Antonio, Texas.
[00:32:26.931 --> 00:32:32.775]  He's an active duty Army officer in the Judge Advocate General Corps for 20 years.
[00:32:32.775 --> 00:32:36.699]  He retired in 2000 at the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.
[00:32:36.699 --> 00:32:42.123]  Professor Atticott spent a quarter of his career as a senior legal advisor to the U.S.
[00:32:43.175 --> 00:32:53.884]  States Army Special Forces and he was in the forces and has been in combat as internationally recognized authority on national security law, terrorism and human rights law.
[00:32:53.884 --> 00:33:05.673]  Professor Atticott not only lectures and participates in professional and academic organizations both in the United States and abroad, but he's also a frequent contributor to national and international news shows including Fox News, MSNBC, on and on and on.
[00:33:05.673 --> 00:33:06.514]  He's also published
[00:33:07.334 --> 00:33:11.777]  Uh, books, articles, and a lot more on a variety of legal topics.
[00:33:11.777 --> 00:33:17.820]  And, uh, you can find out more about him at stmarystexas.edu.
[00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:25.103]  And just type in Jeffrey F. Atticott into the search box and you can learn all about him or just Google Jeffrey F. Atticott.
[00:33:25.103 --> 00:33:32.947]  Mr. Atticott, we debated for about 10 minutes a year ago, uh, on CBS San Antonio down there where you live.
[00:33:32.947 --> 00:33:34.688]  And, uh, you know, I talked about quite a few things.
[00:33:34.688 --> 00:33:35.909]  You kind of laughed them off.
[00:33:36.844 --> 00:33:44.228]  I was saying there was a plan to federalize the National Guard, over the governor's, make the governor's federal officers dual-hatted.
[00:33:44.228 --> 00:33:56.694]  I said that there was a plan to use them for civil insurrection, civil unrest, rioting, and now that's been all over the news, Army Times, Washington Post, and I asked you during the break, you said you are aware of all that.
[00:33:56.694 --> 00:34:00.696]  Tell me, as a legal scholar in this area, what's your view on it?
[00:34:01.661 --> 00:34:17.389]  Well, you know, these things have already been in place for decades because you know that the National Guard can be federalized at the request of the governor to handle emergencies, insurrections, as we had, you know, the riots out in California some years back with the Rodney King issues.
[00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:22.271]  We had the same thing in Arkansas during desegregation times.
[00:34:22.271 --> 00:34:26.353]  So, you know, it's something that's not new, but it's certainly getting more consolidated.
[00:34:26.353 --> 00:34:29.595]  We're seeing, I think you're correct, we're seeing a tightening of the federal noose
[00:34:30.362 --> 00:34:36.627]  Around what the states would do with their national guards.
[00:34:36.627 --> 00:34:43.312]  A lot of former JAG officers are saying this is an end to posse comitatus, that this is outrageous, that this is dangerous.
[00:34:43.312 --> 00:34:44.933]  I mean, this is a major change.
[00:34:44.933 --> 00:34:58.543]  It says that they're federally under NORTHCOM, they're going to serve longer, they're going to be integrated into the main force, and they're going to be under NORTHCOM, and that the governor will then serve dual-hatted at the pleasure of the president under PDD 51.
[00:35:00.274 --> 00:35:05.686]  And you're right to say that Gates says 25 of the 80-something recommendations are already in place.
[00:35:06.545 --> 00:35:10.507]  Yeah, these are recommendations which I would not agree with.
[00:35:10.507 --> 00:35:12.167]  I don't think it's necessary.
[00:35:12.167 --> 00:35:20.450]  And of course, you and I would both agree that what we're really talking about is the balance between increased security and civil liberties or independence.
[00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:29.554]  And, you know, the military plays a vital function in our society because they protect us from external enemies where the police forces protect us from internal enemies.
[00:35:29.554 --> 00:35:32.775]  The question is, you know, how much protection do we need and at what expense?
[00:35:33.639 --> 00:35:44.833]  I would, you know, the general guidance of some of these recommendations, particularly to increase the federal role is something that I'm never comfortable with as an advocate of states' rights.
[00:35:44.833 --> 00:35:47.716]  I'm more of a strict constructionist than that.
[00:35:47.716 --> 00:35:50.439]  Well, I'm glad that you're not a tyrant.
[00:35:50.439 --> 00:35:51.681]  Well, I don't know about that.
[00:35:53.162 --> 00:36:01.465]  I understand that balance, but I think we have to realize that in this time of the war on terror that the balance is going to shift to some degree towards increased security.
[00:36:01.465 --> 00:36:10.809]  If you accept the premise that we're in a state of war, which our Congress, President, and courts have accepted, then that balance has got to shift to some degree.
[00:36:10.809 --> 00:36:11.590]  The threat is real.
[00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:19.012]  As you know, the bipartisan commission said we could expect an attack, weapons, a nuclear, chemical, or biological attack on the homeland by 2013.
[00:36:21.239 --> 00:36:26.041]  And this is, you know, a panel made up of former Democrats, former Republicans.
[00:36:26.041 --> 00:36:35.126]  Yeah, Brookings Institution, Council on Foreign Relations wonks, who are the same ones that recommend national ID cards, face scanning cameras everywhere.
[00:36:35.126 --> 00:36:38.747]  I mean, they recommend what the military industrial complex wants.
[00:36:38.747 --> 00:36:40.968]  Look, here's the deal, Professor.
[00:36:40.968 --> 00:36:42.189]  We all know, quietly,
[00:36:43.368 --> 00:36:54.277]  I mean, were you aware that in the late 80s they had Marines dressed up in police jackets raiding gun dealers in places like North Carolina?
[00:36:54.277 --> 00:37:00.042]  Well, no, in the late 80s I was overseas, you know, and pretty much knows the grindstone doing stuff.
[00:37:00.042 --> 00:37:05.766]  Well, I mean, let me just, I mean, are you aware of a large, creeping, covert operation by the Army domestically?
[00:37:05.766 --> 00:37:11.791]  I mean, it's been in the news 50 times or more in the last month about Army intelligence spying on peace groups.
[00:37:11.791 --> 00:37:12.752]  I mean, you've heard about that, right?
[00:37:13.704 --> 00:37:16.466]  I've heard some stories about that, but I don't have any direct knowledge.
[00:37:16.466 --> 00:37:21.850]  But I do know that the military with NORTHCOM is expanding their role.
[00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:27.693]  I do know that JAG officers are responsible to ensure that they don't cross any lines.
[00:37:27.693 --> 00:37:29.735]  And that's why we have JAG officers that are on the ground.
[00:37:29.735 --> 00:37:32.797]  There's a lot of stuff that's going on that is classified.
[00:37:32.797 --> 00:37:40.922]  I work with NORTHCOM and I work with the Air Force on cyber issues, but I can only go to a certain degree because a lot of the stuff is classified.
[00:37:40.922 --> 00:37:43.444]  But I have heard anecdotally from other JAG officers that
[00:37:44.205 --> 00:37:56.355]  They've had to weigh in and tell individuals that are conducting surveillance operations, for example, to remind them what the laws are, that we cannot use the military to engage in surveillance on U.S.
[00:37:56.355 --> 00:37:57.937]  citizens.
[00:37:57.937 --> 00:38:04.442]  And you do have some of these harebrained commanders that come up with these ideas and have to be constantly watched.
[00:38:04.442 --> 00:38:09.427]  And I think that's why it's important that you're out there as a voice reminding people that things
[00:38:10.393 --> 00:38:11.954]  You know, I don't know the information you get.
[00:38:11.954 --> 00:38:16.875]  It's not always 100% accurate, but it's something that we need to remind ourselves.
[00:38:16.875 --> 00:38:24.118]  Well, I mean, I've had guys in Department of Defense cars get out of the car, wait for me at my car, and threaten me.
[00:38:24.118 --> 00:38:24.378]  Okay?
[00:38:24.378 --> 00:38:25.898]  And that was about nine years ago.
[00:38:25.898 --> 00:38:27.819]  So, believe me, I've had
[00:38:28.965 --> 00:38:42.036]  I've had Delta Force Security come up with guns, this was by the way in the newspaper, in San Antonio and pull guns out and stick them to our chest in 99 when they were down there trying to buy off politicians.
[00:38:42.036 --> 00:38:45.860]  Did you see that in the Associated Press when they tried to buy the mayor and the police chief and the...
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:51.322]  And the Sheriff and they said no to the bags of cash that was in the Associated Press?
[00:38:51.322 --> 00:38:52.482]  Yeah, but you know what?
[00:38:52.482 --> 00:38:53.423]  Oh, just bags of cash.
[00:38:53.423 --> 00:38:56.063]  I've never dealt with, you know, the media.
[00:38:56.063 --> 00:39:01.525]  You've got to take a large grain of salt when you listen to a lot of media stories because I've had a lot of media stories.
[00:39:01.525 --> 00:39:07.247]  I've had guys in uniforms, stick, stick, stick, pull guns out on us, sir, in San Antonio.
[00:39:07.247 --> 00:39:09.568]  No, I'm not doubting that that was the case.
[00:39:09.568 --> 00:39:11.629]  All because I wanted to go see what the Army was doing.
[00:39:12.768 --> 00:39:17.089]  Well, I mean, were you attempting to go on to a reservation where it's not authorized to go?
[00:39:17.089 --> 00:39:18.890]  I mean, what were the facts of it?
[00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:19.590]  Absolutely.
[00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:23.251]  It was Fort Sam Houston, an open base.
[00:39:23.251 --> 00:39:24.911]  This is pre-9-11.
[00:39:24.911 --> 00:39:29.673]  And we're there, and they had gone in and blown out a bunch of windows there.
[00:39:29.673 --> 00:39:31.893]  They'd been trying to drill secretly in the city.
[00:39:31.893 --> 00:39:33.394]  They'd been forced onto the base.
[00:39:33.394 --> 00:39:34.174]  And so we're there.
[00:39:35.375 --> 00:39:41.502]  Uh, trying to go interview people on the base so they just ran out and pointed guns at us and took our tapes and erased them and threw us off.
[00:39:41.502 --> 00:39:46.549]  But, I have had them come after me and point guns at me in Florida off of a base.
[00:39:48.675 --> 00:39:57.782]  Well, you know, again, I don't know all the circumstances, but I do understand, you know, in the positions that you have and the positions I have, I've had death threats from NPR, for Pete's sake.
[00:39:57.782 --> 00:39:59.743]  I've had, you know, Air America hang up on me.
[00:39:59.743 --> 00:40:05.527]  I've had, you know, all sorts of spurious comments made about, you know, all sorts of things that are totally untrue.
[00:40:05.527 --> 00:40:07.869]  And you get to kind of wonder, who are these people?
[00:40:07.869 --> 00:40:09.930]  And what's their real agenda?
[00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:12.112]  Instead of me just beating over the head, let me ask you this.
[00:40:12.112 --> 00:40:15.074]  You said these are just recommendations from Gates.
[00:40:15.074 --> 00:40:15.615]  Look, there's...
[00:40:16.863 --> 00:40:18.725]  There's 80 plus recommendations.
[00:40:18.725 --> 00:40:22.508]  He says 25 are fully implemented and no change is needed.
[00:40:22.508 --> 00:40:30.975]  And you read those, and it... Listen, they already had the explosive ordinance teams and the other secret teams behind them.
[00:40:30.975 --> 00:40:33.056]  We had an FBI guy pull up at a checkpoint.
[00:40:33.056 --> 00:40:34.437]  The Army was running in 98.
[00:40:34.437 --> 00:40:35.859]  It's all on video, sir.
[00:40:35.859 --> 00:40:37.300]  I can send it to you.
[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:41.103]  Jump out of the car and say, you can't videotape these Army people at a checkpoint.
[00:40:41.883 --> 00:40:43.244]  And I said, well, we're going to keep doing it.
[00:40:43.244 --> 00:40:50.331]  So he gave us a printout for the media, but under it, he gave us that said, not for distribution, secret.
[00:40:50.331 --> 00:40:54.235]  And by the way, this is on my website, said we are in 77 counties.
[00:40:54.235 --> 00:40:57.599]  Don't tell the public we're here for warrant service.
[00:40:57.599 --> 00:41:00.402]  We're here to assist you in any and all ways.
[00:41:00.402 --> 00:41:01.723]  Now, is it?
[00:41:02.535 --> 00:41:04.176]  Legal and lawful.
[00:41:04.176 --> 00:41:05.516]  And you're going to say you don't know about this.
[00:41:05.516 --> 00:41:07.337]  I find that hard to believe.
[00:41:07.337 --> 00:41:12.359]  To have the Army doing warrant service in 77 counties as of 10 years ago.
[00:41:12.359 --> 00:41:13.619]  I don't know what's going on now.
[00:41:13.619 --> 00:41:15.000]  No, it would be illegal.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.741]  What you describe is illegal 10 years ago and it would be illegal today.
[00:41:18.741 --> 00:41:26.184]  The Army cannot engage in search and seizure arrest, warrant service on civilians.
[00:41:26.184 --> 00:41:30.786]  And that's a job that civilian police officers would have to do.
[00:41:31.624 --> 00:41:37.548]  The military will be prohibited from doing that by the Posse Comitatus Act, which has a lot of exceptions, but that's not one of the exceptions.
[00:41:37.548 --> 00:41:40.550]  They cannot engage in support for law enforcement.
[00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:42.091]  They cannot engage in search and seizure.
[00:41:42.091 --> 00:41:42.271]  No.
[00:41:42.271 --> 00:41:43.072]  That's what they called it.
[00:41:43.072 --> 00:41:45.794]  They said, we want to support you in warrant service.
[00:41:45.794 --> 00:41:46.814]  We want to support you.
[00:41:46.814 --> 00:41:49.296]  It listed all, but I mean, support.
[00:41:49.296 --> 00:42:00.343]  I mean, what is support when I've got Swansboro, North Carolina Marines openly running a real checkpoint, not a drill, searching people's cars with the police.
[00:42:00.343 --> 00:42:00.964]  Now, what is that?
[00:42:02.539 --> 00:42:06.262]  Yeah, I mean, that's the issue, is where do you cross the line?
[00:42:06.262 --> 00:42:18.070]  There's been a series of lawsuits against different entities, starting in Wounded Knee, which I'm familiar with, and moving into some of the other support issues, quote-unquote.
[00:42:18.070 --> 00:42:25.175]  And to this day, no soldier has ever served any jail time, even though the courts have looked at this and said there's been some violations.
[00:42:25.795 --> 00:42:32.180]  No one has ever been fined, and no one has ever served any jail time, so you've got to wonder, does the POSTA-COVID TABAC really have any teeth?
[00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:34.021]  Well, let me ask you this.
[00:42:34.021 --> 00:42:45.749]  I mean, overall, historically, the Founders' common sense, our culture, you know, he said we have to get rid of our cultural prejudices against having federal troops in America.
[00:42:45.749 --> 00:42:51.293]  Engaging in law enforcement, I mean, it says civil unrest, riot control,
[00:42:52.242 --> 00:42:53.324]  Uh, that's now on record.
[00:42:53.324 --> 00:42:55.968]  And with all these denials about it, I mean, is that the American way?
[00:42:55.968 --> 00:42:57.891]  I mean, you're talking about terrorism.
[00:42:57.891 --> 00:42:59.593]  This isn't a chemical or biological attack.
[00:42:59.593 --> 00:43:03.179]  This is... This is rioting, civil unrest, microwave cannons.
[00:43:03.897 --> 00:43:07.059]  Well, as you know, the Posse Comitatus Act is not in the Constitution.
[00:43:07.059 --> 00:43:18.806]  It's a congressional law that was passed in 1878, and there's many exceptions to it, but it's not, when you say it's a part of the American way, well, it's not a constitutional issue that the military cannot engage in these activities.
[00:43:18.806 --> 00:43:23.948]  Well, what's the section of the Constitution that says don't quarter the troops, don't have them engaging the people?
[00:43:23.948 --> 00:43:24.649]  I can pull it up here.
[00:43:25.089 --> 00:43:27.112]  Well, yeah, but I mean, living in their house, that's all it says.
[00:43:27.112 --> 00:43:32.738]  It doesn't say that you can't engage in arrest or search and seizure, those types of things, as they did during Reconstruction, during the Civil War.
[00:43:32.738 --> 00:43:39.766]  I mean, they were all over the place, engaging in law enforcement in the South, and as a consequence of that, that's how we got the Papacabatadas out.
[00:43:39.766 --> 00:43:40.827]  They didn't live in people's houses.
[00:43:40.827 --> 00:43:42.169]  Well, now they just seize your house.
[00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:48.433]  Now the police shows with acid forfeiture and seizure, they just seize it and throw you out and move in.
[00:43:48.433 --> 00:43:53.877]  The Supreme Court has said that the state itself can say, we want your property, and boom, it's gone.
[00:43:53.877 --> 00:43:57.079]  Yeah, but how do they do that without a judge, a jury, an indictment?
[00:43:57.079 --> 00:44:01.622]  I mean, you know about all the cases where the old lady's got four grand in her purse, so they take it?
[00:44:01.622 --> 00:44:04.584]  Well, yeah, I mean, they do it because the Supreme Court has said they can do it.
[00:44:05.598 --> 00:44:08.581]  The Supreme Court said without even arresting you, they can take your money?
[00:44:08.581 --> 00:44:13.685]  Oh, no, I'm talking about a seizure of property that the Supreme Court has said the state has the right to.
[00:44:13.685 --> 00:44:16.547]  Yeah, but after you've been found guilty.
[00:44:16.547 --> 00:44:19.510]  I mean, you're aware they're taking property without that?
[00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:21.371]  Well, no, they can take public property.
[00:44:21.371 --> 00:44:28.797]  The Supreme Court, this is maybe a little bit off track, but the Supreme Court ruled a couple years ago that states have the right to say, we like your property on the corner of such and such.
[00:44:28.797 --> 00:44:31.239]  Oh, you're talking about New London and Kelo, yeah.
[00:44:31.239 --> 00:44:34.242]  Yeah, I mean, you know, just taking a property, I mean, that's outrageous, but
[00:44:34.782 --> 00:44:35.623]  You know, there we go.
[00:44:35.623 --> 00:44:38.524]  It's the fight all nighter, though.
[00:44:38.524 --> 00:44:40.165]  Well, thank goodness.
[00:44:40.165 --> 00:44:41.126]  The Supreme Court released it.
[00:44:41.126 --> 00:44:49.531]  It came down the right side of the Second Amendment this last term when they recognized the private right of private individuals to own firearms.
[00:44:49.531 --> 00:44:54.674]  But in the addendum they said, but we can reasonably restrict it under laws.
[00:44:54.674 --> 00:44:56.916]  So that's really a gun grab.
[00:44:57.769 --> 00:45:02.811]  It's a gun grab, but at least this is the first time they recognize that there was a constitutional right.
[00:45:02.811 --> 00:45:07.013]  They did away with the nonsense that, well, the Second Amendment clause only applies to the militia.
[00:45:07.013 --> 00:45:09.454]  They said, no, it applies to individuals.
[00:45:09.454 --> 00:45:14.016]  That's 5-4, but still, we've at least got some sanity on that issue.
[00:45:14.016 --> 00:45:16.757]  But there's a lot of things about this country that are
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:25.462]  There's no doubt about it, but there's no such thing as a perfect government.
[00:45:25.462 --> 00:45:29.142]  Governments killed more people last century than anything else.
[00:45:29.142 --> 00:45:30.343]  Hundreds of millions.
[00:45:30.343 --> 00:45:32.963]  Government's always been the greatest threat to liberty.
[00:45:32.963 --> 00:45:38.644]  I'm more worried about a government with troops on the streets, working with the police, standing on street corners with machine guns.
[00:45:38.644 --> 00:45:40.865]  They're saying nationwide this is going to happen.
[00:45:41.685 --> 00:45:47.307]  Uh, then I am about Al Qaeda, uh, whatever that, you know, supposedly is.
[00:45:47.307 --> 00:45:54.188]  I mean, I'm a lot more worried, uh, about, uh, you know, the end of my republic.
[00:45:54.188 --> 00:45:54.569]  I, I hear you.
[00:45:54.569 --> 00:45:56.249]  I mean, I'm, I'm very concerned about that.
[00:45:56.249 --> 00:46:02.411]  That also, and, and, you know, it, it requires constant vigilance to ensure that big government doesn't make little people.
[00:46:02.411 --> 00:46:07.292]  We, we need little government to make big people where you have your own decisions, make up your own minds about things.
[00:46:09.066 --> 00:46:10.026]  But we're seeing a shift in that.
[00:46:10.026 --> 00:46:14.847]  I mean, this last election was all about, you know, the big government is going to take care of you from cradle to grave.
[00:46:14.847 --> 00:46:23.009]  Well, it seems like I'm talking to a different person, because when I debated you on the show, you were basically just pooh-poohing everything I said.
[00:46:23.009 --> 00:46:24.990]  We can play the clip if you want.
[00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:35.752]  And then now, I mean, my point is, I'm tired of people telling me that I haven't been to urban warfare drills, where they have role players screaming, I'm an American, please don't put me in a camp, please don't take my guns.
[00:46:36.532 --> 00:46:40.977]  And I know that they gave the 29 Palms survey, but I know they've given a lot of new surveys.
[00:46:40.977 --> 00:46:42.578]  Will you fire on citizens?
[00:46:42.578 --> 00:46:43.780]  Will you confiscate guns?
[00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:46.642]  I know in New Orleans they took guns from high and dry people.
[00:46:46.642 --> 00:46:55.251]  I know that in Illinois, two months ago, the governor announced they're going to use the military, the National Guard, in anti-gun sweeps statewide.
[00:46:55.251 --> 00:46:56.612]  That was in the Chicago Tribune.
[00:46:56.612 --> 00:46:58.534]  I played the governor's press conference here.
[00:46:58.534 --> 00:46:59.936]  I mean, sir!
[00:47:00.948 --> 00:47:04.430]  This, having the military pointed at the people, this is not for Al-Qaeda.
[00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:07.993]  They're saying this is for civil unrest.
[00:47:07.993 --> 00:47:11.935]  Right, but I mean, they're looking at it, you know, at a possibility if we have civil unrest.
[00:47:11.935 --> 00:47:21.882]  I mean, if we had a bioterrorism attack, which is a likelihood, and that's what one of the things the Commission reported, that they felt it was more likely than not that we would have a bioterrorism attack by 2013.
[00:47:21.882 --> 00:47:26.905]  That's where you get somebody, for example, with smallpox is infectious, with anthrax is not.
[00:47:27.597 --> 00:47:35.925]  But if you really had one of those issues occur, as we did in the early 1900s, you would see pandemonium in this entire society.
[00:47:35.925 --> 00:47:37.907]  You'd have to quarantine cities.
[00:47:37.907 --> 00:47:39.349]  You know, and who's going to do that?
[00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:41.631]  Or a financial collapse.
[00:47:41.631 --> 00:47:42.472]  Well, that's possible.
[00:47:42.472 --> 00:47:50.400]  I mean, you know, if people can't eat in law and order, you know, you have the local folks that are responsible for it, but if they can't handle it,
[00:47:51.210 --> 00:47:52.331]  Who's going to handle a pandemic?
[00:47:52.331 --> 00:47:53.893]  Who's going to handle these types of things?
[00:47:53.893 --> 00:47:54.713]  It has to be the military.
[00:47:54.713 --> 00:47:59.297]  They have to be trained for it, but... Hey, did you hear about that Anthrax case?
[00:47:59.297 --> 00:48:05.343]  The AP reported the whole White House was on Cipro September 10th, three weeks before the letters were mailed.
[00:48:06.663 --> 00:48:08.325]  I had not heard that, no.
[00:48:08.325 --> 00:48:10.527]  Oh, Google it.
[00:48:10.527 --> 00:48:11.567]  You're a smart guy.
[00:48:11.567 --> 00:48:13.649]  Do you have a computer in front of you?
[00:48:13.649 --> 00:48:15.751]  Well, not right now, but I'm at home.
[00:48:15.751 --> 00:48:19.154]  But I want you to know, I'm not just saying that.
[00:48:19.154 --> 00:48:19.994]  It was U.S.
[00:48:19.994 --> 00:48:24.458]  Army weaponized anthrax and the FBI claimed it was made in a bathtub.
[00:48:24.458 --> 00:48:25.859]  But it turned out it was weaponized.
[00:48:25.859 --> 00:48:27.781]  It was from Fort Detrick.
[00:48:27.781 --> 00:48:29.222]  Well, that's the scariest thing of all.
[00:48:29.222 --> 00:48:31.924]  The fellow that apparently did this was one of our own.
[00:48:31.924 --> 00:48:34.066]  I mean, he was a low-wealth terrorist from Fort Detrick.
[00:48:35.565 --> 00:48:39.587]  You know, you've got 5 people dead and 17 seriously injured.
[00:48:39.587 --> 00:48:47.912]  But, you know, the good news about anthrax, it's not contagious, whereas other biological... Smallpox is, yeah.
[00:48:47.912 --> 00:48:49.032]  Yeah, I mean, they're contagious.
[00:48:49.032 --> 00:49:00.479]  Well, you know that's why they discontinued four years ago trying to give the smallpox shot to first responders, because they found it was actually causing real smallpox outbreaks, and it was a live smallpox injection.
[00:49:01.241 --> 00:49:04.270]  And also the police and military were refusing to take it.
[00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:04.752]  I wonder why.
[00:49:04.752 --> 00:49:06.878]  Maybe they don't love America.
[00:49:08.539 --> 00:49:13.383]  Well, I was very nervous about the forced anthrax shots we were required to take when I was in the military.
[00:49:13.383 --> 00:49:16.185]  I'm kind of worried about flu shots.
[00:49:16.185 --> 00:49:18.387]  It's the best way to get the flu.
[00:49:18.387 --> 00:49:19.768]  Take the shot.
[00:49:19.768 --> 00:49:20.729]  I agree.
[00:49:20.729 --> 00:49:21.449]  But I'm being serious.
[00:49:21.449 --> 00:49:29.856]  I mean, having been in the military for 20 years and working for the federal government, I can tell you that they're extremely incompetent.
[00:49:29.856 --> 00:49:34.700]  And a lot of these issues that come up on newspapers and various reports where they assign these great
[00:49:35.387 --> 00:49:35.928]  Oh, really?
[00:49:35.928 --> 00:49:39.250]  If I don't pay my taxes, they're gonna come take my house and arrest me?
[00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:40.411]  They seem pretty confident there.
[00:49:50.032 --> 00:49:55.655]  Well, yeah, but it, you know, you get your good lore, you can drag it out for a while, but... You know, you're a very interesting fellow.
[00:49:55.655 --> 00:50:03.220]  We've only got two more segments with you, but I tell you, you're telling me they're incompetent, there's not a problem, but you know what?
[00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:05.501]  I see a lot of precision here.
[00:50:05.501 --> 00:50:07.723]  I mean, the military can shoot a cruise missile down your chimney.
[00:50:08.123 --> 00:50:14.408]  I don't think- I think- What will you do when the economy collapses, store shelves are empty, and your stored food is gone?
[00:50:14.408 --> 00:50:16.249]  How will you feed your family?
[00:50:16.249 --> 00:50:23.595]  True self-sufficiency and peace of mind is being able to grow a wide range of crops, ensuring a well-balanced diet for your family.
[00:50:23.595 --> 00:50:29.560]  GetSeeds.net is offering 100 different varieties of GM-free vegetable seeds for only $49 with free shipping!

[00:51:08.852 --> 00:51:15.622]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:51:15.622 --> 00:51:18.265]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:51:18.265 --> 00:51:19.828]  But who is the enemy?
[00:51:19.828 --> 00:51:20.609]  Bin Laden.
[00:51:20.609 --> 00:51:21.490]  This is his ammo.
[00:51:21.490 --> 00:51:23.012]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:51:23.012 --> 00:51:24.214]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:51:24.954 --> 00:51:32.120]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:32.600]  Some U.S.
[00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:38.945]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:51:38.945 --> 00:51:42.408]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:51:42.648 --> 00:51:52.910]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:54.150]  Fabled enemies.

[00:53:16.664 --> 00:53:19.967]  That atmosphere is not justified.
[00:53:19.967 --> 00:53:39.766]  Many of us were told in private conversations that if we voted against this bill on Monday, that the sky would fall, the market would drop two or three thousand points the first day, another couple thousand the second day, and a few members were even told that there would be martial law in America if we voted no.
[00:53:40.999 --> 00:53:42.981]  That's what I call fear-mongering.
[00:53:42.981 --> 00:53:45.042]  Alright, we had Congressman Sherman on.
[00:53:45.042 --> 00:53:46.324]  That was Brad Sherman.
[00:53:46.324 --> 00:53:48.345]  We also, of course, have Senator Inhofe on record.
[00:53:48.345 --> 00:53:57.753]  They were threatened with physical martial law and Congress being ignored if the bankers weren't given the empowerment bill, Professor Atticott.
[00:53:57.753 --> 00:54:00.375]  And that's exactly what I told you a year ago on TV.
[00:54:00.375 --> 00:54:04.639]  I said PDD 51, the Homeland Security Committee, isn't even allowed to see it.
[00:54:04.639 --> 00:54:08.042]  The cover sheet expanded the powers of the executive under COG.
[00:54:09.384 --> 00:54:11.045]  I mean, is this American?
[00:54:11.045 --> 00:54:12.086]  Is this America?
[00:54:12.086 --> 00:54:16.730]  And I can play Inhofe, the Senator if you'd like, Republican from Oklahoma.
[00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:20.073]  Is the President threatening martial law in Congress if they don't pass bills?
[00:54:20.073 --> 00:54:22.234]  Is that freedom?
[00:54:22.234 --> 00:54:25.077]  Well, certainly the answer to that general question is no.
[00:54:25.077 --> 00:54:28.860]  I mean, you obviously cannot engage in that type of activity.
[00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:32.643]  We've had periods in our history where we have twisted the Constitution.
[00:54:32.643 --> 00:54:33.023]  Lincoln?
[00:54:33.023 --> 00:54:37.807]  Yeah, Lincoln was a war criminal, there's no doubt about it, but you won't hear anybody say that in the textbooks.
[00:54:38.936 --> 00:54:44.470]  Uh, and he engaged in all sorts of violations of the Constitution, which he said, I have to do it in the name of freedom, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:54:45.474 --> 00:54:55.301]  And, you know, we've got to watch very carefully people that use this quote-unquote war on terror as a method to achieve goals that are inappropriate.
[00:54:55.301 --> 00:54:57.082]  Well, that's what Obama is saying.
[00:54:57.082 --> 00:55:01.245]  He wants to be like Lincoln, and now they're announcing 20,000 troops or more?
[00:55:01.245 --> 00:55:06.269]  And have you heard him talk about a million-man domestic security force as big as our army?
[00:55:06.269 --> 00:55:10.692]  Yeah, I think that, you know, that causes me great concern because, you know, what do you need it for?
[00:55:10.692 --> 00:55:11.753]  You already have the military.
[00:55:12.293 --> 00:55:22.957]  The military is under some restrictions as we have the current laws that we deal with, and you know, a state governor would have to request federalization of the state troops.
[00:55:22.957 --> 00:55:26.558]  Well, Gates is saying, sir, and you said you haven't read it yet, please read it today.
[00:55:26.558 --> 00:55:34.561]  I know you're a busy guy, running a whole department, a whole school, a whole law school, but he says we need to change the law where it's purely federal.
[00:55:35.996 --> 00:55:37.456]  Yeah, and I would disagree with that.
[00:55:37.456 --> 00:55:38.457]  I would oppose that.
[00:55:38.457 --> 00:55:47.960]  You know, again, as someone that's having seen that for the first time, and I've read the summary of it, I'm totally opposed to that degree.
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:50.960]  I mean, that balance between increased security and civil liberties, we're not there yet.
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:51.921]  I want to tell you something.
[00:55:51.921 --> 00:55:53.361]  I'm not a kook.
[00:55:53.361 --> 00:55:54.682]  I don't make things up.
[00:55:54.682 --> 00:56:02.744]  And I read the 400-page report that they've drawn this out of, and I'm begging you to go read the whole thing, sir, because I think you're going to get more concerned.
[00:56:03.675 --> 00:56:05.736]  Well, I'm going to do that.
[00:56:05.736 --> 00:56:07.657]  I will certainly do that.
[00:56:07.657 --> 00:56:12.199]  But I think it's, you know, as we get into the new administration, they've got some tremendous challenges ahead.
[00:56:12.199 --> 00:56:19.603]  We've got an executive that has no military experience, no experience really of any kind in the real world, in my opinion.
[00:56:19.603 --> 00:56:28.588]  Now, he better surround himself with people that understand the dangers that we're facing, but also understand the concept that we need to protect our civil liberties.
[00:56:28.588 --> 00:56:32.730]  And I've heard that call about this, you know, the special force of individuals.
[00:56:33.576 --> 00:56:37.759]  And that immediately brings to mind, you know, what are these people going to do?
[00:56:37.759 --> 00:56:39.060]  Why do you need them?
[00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:42.882]  I don't see the threat to the degree that we need to create a special force.
[00:56:42.882 --> 00:56:46.144]  We certainly... A million person spy force!
[00:56:46.144 --> 00:56:49.667]  He had it on his change.gov and pulled it down.
[00:56:49.667 --> 00:56:50.487]  Yeah, I saw that.
[00:56:50.487 --> 00:56:52.308]  I saw what was up there.
[00:56:52.308 --> 00:56:55.551]  And, you know, I'm glad that it was pulled down.
[00:56:55.551 --> 00:56:58.152]  I haven't heard anything since then about that issue.
[00:56:58.152 --> 00:57:01.314]  Of course, he said many things during the campaign that he has now done a 180 on.
[00:57:02.895 --> 00:57:06.138]  Perhaps he was saying the things that many politicians do to acquire a vote.
[00:57:06.138 --> 00:57:10.521]  No, the FBI is already setting up these local community tattletale squads.
[00:57:10.521 --> 00:57:19.649]  Well, the FBI has a variety of programs that they coordinate with private industry, particularly the cyber world, to do various things under the Secret Service.
[00:57:19.649 --> 00:57:21.590]  That's right.
[00:57:21.590 --> 00:57:22.030]  Exactly.
[00:57:22.030 --> 00:57:26.474]  And they told them, that was in the news, that they're secretly getting ready for martial law.
[00:57:26.474 --> 00:57:27.855]  That was in mainstream newspapers.
[00:57:28.255 --> 00:57:34.337]  Well, I detail the role of the Secret Service with business communities in my book, On Terrorist Law, Chapter 8.
[00:57:34.337 --> 00:57:35.317]  Well, let's plug that book.
[00:57:35.317 --> 00:57:37.578]  We're back in one minute for a final five minutes.
[00:57:37.578 --> 00:57:40.518]  And I have to tell you, Mr. Atticott, now I'm getting to interview you for a third time.
[00:57:40.518 --> 00:57:47.260]  I'm liking you a lot more, and we appreciate you living in reality and actually having concerns on this issue.
[00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:50.701]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:50.701 --> 00:57:53.322]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:57:53.322 --> 00:57:56.083]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:05.089 --> 00:58:06.430]  That's an inside job!
[00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:07.571]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:58:07.571 --> 00:58:09.272]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:58:09.272 --> 00:58:16.597]  How do the American people know that 9-11 wasn't staged, wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the C.A.R.?
[00:58:16.597 --> 00:58:25.464]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door!
[00:58:25.464 --> 00:58:30.587]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:58:30.587 --> 00:58:31.748]  An inside job!
[00:58:31.748 --> 00:58:32.709]  An inside job!
[00:58:38.205 --> 00:58:41.626]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:58:41.626 --> 00:58:44.087]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:58:44.087 --> 00:58:50.008]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of that.
[00:58:50.008 --> 00:58:50.988]  Truth Rising.

[00:58:56.069 --> 00:59:01.611]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:59:01.611 --> 00:59:03.991]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:03.991 --> 00:59:06.792]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:59:08.147 --> 00:59:09.908]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:09.908 --> 00:59:11.490]  You want answers?
[00:59:11.490 --> 00:59:13.431]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:13.431 --> 00:59:17.234]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:17.234 --> 00:59:22.277]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:22.277 --> 00:59:31.824]  AP and Bloomberg reported, as you know, on Tuesday, $8.4 trillion now stolen by the foreign offshore banks has nothing to do with the
[00:59:34.478 --> 00:59:35.359]  Credit crisis.
[00:59:35.359 --> 00:59:36.840]  I'll cover that after Mr. Atikon leaves.
[00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:41.163]  We have about four minutes left with him right now in this short segment.
[00:59:41.163 --> 00:59:42.585]  And he blew me away during the one-minute break.
[00:59:42.585 --> 00:59:46.648]  He said he's about to go to Israel to do a big talk on chemical bio-attack.
[00:59:46.648 --> 00:59:53.273]  And then he said if Israel doesn't strike in the next month or so, I'll be back to do an interview with you.
[00:59:53.273 --> 00:59:54.934]  If not, I won't be coming back.
[00:59:54.934 --> 00:59:55.755]  What does that mean?
[00:59:55.755 --> 01:00:00.499]  Because I have several mainstream articles today out of Israel where they're saying they may go ahead and hit Iran.
[01:00:01.127 --> 01:00:08.331]  You know, the bipartisan commission report that said we're going to have an attack on the homeland by 2013, they had recommendations.
[01:00:08.331 --> 01:00:16.376]  One of their major recommendations was, Iran has to be stopped from acquiring radioactive materials, nuclear weapons, etc, etc.
[01:00:16.376 --> 01:00:23.100]  And my sources tell me, and I work with Israelis a lot, that at the very latest, Iran will have nuclear weapons by 2012, at the latest.
[01:00:25.362 --> 01:00:34.652]  The time to attack a totalitarian regime that is whacked out of their mind is before they get weapons of mass destruction, not after they get weapons of mass destruction.
[01:00:34.652 --> 01:00:37.234]  The Israelis know that.
[01:00:37.234 --> 01:00:39.437]  And that's the challenge for Mr. Obama.
[01:00:39.437 --> 01:00:41.039]  It's going to happen on his watch.
[01:00:41.039 --> 01:00:44.142]  But we heard that about Iraq, about WMDs.
[01:00:44.142 --> 01:00:46.925]  Well, what we heard about Iraq is that they already had them.
[01:00:47.621 --> 01:00:50.125]  Um, but they were in the process of developing.
[01:00:50.125 --> 01:00:54.713]  If we had to win Iraq in 2003, he would probably have it by today, because that was his goal.
[01:00:54.713 --> 01:00:58.159]  He had, you know, he really had knocked them out in 81 with his Osterich reactor.
[01:00:58.914 --> 01:01:00.075]  He had used scud missiles against me.
[01:01:00.075 --> 01:01:02.336]  But the inspectors had been all over that place.
[01:01:02.336 --> 01:01:03.877]  They were in the Stone Age.
[01:01:03.877 --> 01:01:04.337]  I know.
[01:01:04.337 --> 01:01:09.620]  But, but, but, you know, after 9-11 was not a time for Saddam Hussein to be kicking Panama right in the face.
[01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:11.141]  No, I'm kicking all the inspectors out.
[01:01:11.141 --> 01:01:13.082]  And you'd have to guess what I got about it.
[01:01:13.082 --> 01:01:13.922]  He was not very bright.
[01:01:13.922 --> 01:01:16.103]  You don't mess with us after 9-11.
[01:01:16.103 --> 01:01:18.485]  If 9-11 hadn't happened, we would not have went into Iraq.
[01:01:19.185 --> 01:01:22.566]  And if we don't have a major attack on the homeland, Mr. Obama will not go.
[01:01:22.566 --> 01:01:24.747]  Okay, well you say you're close to the Israelis.
[01:01:24.747 --> 01:01:32.370]  Are you saying, I mean they're saying in their newspapers, I'm sure you've seen it yesterday and today, but is the word they're getting ready to hit Iran?
[01:01:32.370 --> 01:01:35.171]  Well, you know, it depends on who you talk to.
[01:01:35.171 --> 01:01:37.973]  There's a lot of chatter, let me just put it that way.
[01:01:37.973 --> 01:01:43.135]  But I can tell you from the sources that I know of, they're very high placed, that they believe that Iran will have the weapons by 2012.
[01:01:43.135 --> 01:01:43.695]  The U.S.
[01:01:43.695 --> 01:01:45.576]  is not going to stop them.
[01:01:45.576 --> 01:01:46.316]  Who is going to stop them?
[01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:53.522]  And they're threatened by Iran, because Iran has quite frankly said, we're going to kill all of you.
[01:01:53.522 --> 01:01:56.765]  So knowing that, I think it's prudent that they should do something.
[01:01:56.765 --> 01:02:03.551]  Now, do you sit down and negotiate your way out of this, or do you do what in the real world... But you were saying you're going over to Israel for a little while, but you may not be coming.
[01:02:03.551 --> 01:02:05.933]  Is the word... I mean, you're hearing there's a good chance, though.
[01:02:05.933 --> 01:02:08.094]  I mean, specifically what you were saying during the break.
[01:02:08.094 --> 01:02:15.921]  I'm not... Well, I was kind of in jest, because, you know, I would not be surprised if the Israelis struck on their own initiative.
[01:02:16.425 --> 01:02:39.583]  I'm going over there tomorrow for a few days at a bioterrorism conference, and in jest I say if I come back, because it could happen today, it could happen tomorrow, it could happen in a year, but the Israelis have discussed it, they have engaged in war gaming with their Air Force, the entire Air Force last year as you know was a war game, essentially a practice run, but they're thinking about the issue, I mean that's, they're thinking about it, it could very well occur tomorrow, or a month from now.
[01:02:39.583 --> 01:02:44.487]  Well why did the West help give nukes to Pakistan if it's so bad to have nukes over there?
[01:02:45.205 --> 01:02:50.188]  Well, you know, that's another story, but essentially, as we were saying, incompetence.
[01:02:50.188 --> 01:02:55.052]  I mean, our intelligence was so bad, we didn't realize the Pakistanis were as far along as they were.
[01:02:55.052 --> 01:03:05.799]  They lied, they hid things from us, and we were totally surprised, really, the world was totally surprised when Pakistan detonated its first nuclear weapon.
[01:03:05.799 --> 01:03:09.321]  But, I mean, Israel's got at least 400 nukes and great delivery systems.
[01:03:09.321 --> 01:03:13.024]  I mean, let's say Iran in three years, two years, is going to get an A-bomb.
[01:03:13.024 --> 01:03:14.025]  I mean, they're not going to.
[01:03:14.972 --> 01:03:16.895]  Well, deterrence works with rational people.
[01:03:16.895 --> 01:03:19.378]  A lot of these jihadists, they want to die.
[01:03:19.378 --> 01:03:24.725]  I mean, on 7-7 in July, I would take the backpack off and put it on the subway and walk away to fight another day.
[01:03:24.725 --> 01:03:26.628]  They want to die for jihad.
[01:03:26.628 --> 01:03:29.471]  I mean, the 9-11... Professor, when you get back, I want to have you back on, but I...
[01:03:29.872 --> 01:03:44.777]  I'm going to try to send you a lot of material, because on certain levels you sound like a good guy, on other levels, I think you're really believing a lot of what you're saying, and I think some of it's true, but I think a lot of it is public relations, and maybe you're drinking the Kool-Aid, maybe you're not.
[01:03:44.777 --> 01:03:48.358]  But Professor Jeffrey F. Atticott, thank you for speaking with us.
[01:03:48.358 --> 01:03:54.420]  Let me say bye to you behind the scenes here when we've got a break in about five seconds, then we'll let you go.
[01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:56.661]  Folks, we'll be back, and I'll have comments on all this.
[01:03:56.661 --> 01:03:57.021]  Stay with us.
[01:04:00.984 --> 01:04:02.645]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:04:02.645 --> 01:04:07.410]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:10.372]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:04:10.372 --> 01:04:13.415]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:04:13.415 --> 01:04:19.560]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:25.125]  Our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for the special interest, so they ignored your screams not to do it.
[01:04:25.345 --> 01:04:27.166]  They turned off the telephones and email.
[01:04:27.166 --> 01:04:31.129]  They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air.
[01:04:31.129 --> 01:04:33.951]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[01:04:33.951 --> 01:04:43.097]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities, particularly food, beyond many Americans' reach.
[01:04:43.097 --> 01:04:50.182]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[01:04:50.182 --> 01:04:52.183]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast,
[01:04:52.403 --> 01:04:54.625]  There seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[01:04:54.625 --> 01:05:00.310]  The private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[01:05:00.310 --> 01:05:03.573]  The stores have less food but jack up prices to stay in business.
[01:05:03.573 --> 01:05:06.937]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[01:05:06.937 --> 01:05:08.738]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:12.462]  One third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[01:05:12.802 --> 01:05:16.943]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food.
[01:05:16.943 --> 01:05:24.465]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the new old order, has a lot less control over you.
[01:05:24.465 --> 01:05:28.406]  And so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[01:05:28.406 --> 01:05:31.267]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.

[01:06:04.664 --> 01:06:05.805]  Take action today.
[01:06:05.805 --> 01:06:09.467]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:06:09.467 --> 01:06:15.070]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:22.156 --> 01:06:36.120]  You know, talking to Atticott, he is a mainline conservative Christian who really believes that the Muslims are basically the Antichrist and are going to try to start World War III.
[01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:49.904]  I mean, it's a fact that AQCon Laboratories was aided by Bill Clinton and the Council on Foreign Relations Anglo-American Syndicate to get its nukes to create global crisis in Central Asia.
[01:06:49.904 --> 01:06:50.724]  And that's on record.
[01:06:51.883 --> 01:06:59.168]  It's on record that the head of ABB, the Swiss company, gave the nuke reactors to build bombs to North Korea.
[01:06:59.168 --> 01:06:59.829]  Why?
[01:06:59.829 --> 01:07:06.153]  To escalate crises worldwide so the West has a pretext to go in.
[01:07:06.153 --> 01:07:13.298]  Iran had a moderate government, let the UN totally defile their sovereignty, run their entire system, control their entire country.
[01:07:14.707 --> 01:07:23.333]  to build peaceful nuclear reactors and then the UN and the US went back on their word and said now you can't even have those.
[01:07:23.333 --> 01:07:28.956]  Iran has had their government overthrown at least twice by the United States and England on record.
[01:07:28.956 --> 01:07:32.719]  The United States staged terror attacks there to blame it on the government and overthrow them.
[01:07:32.719 --> 01:07:34.260]  Kind of a reverse false flag.
[01:07:36.107 --> 01:07:38.489]  Just generally governments doing it to blame it on some group.
[01:07:38.489 --> 01:07:46.795]  This was criminals in our government doing it to blame it on their government and said that the secular Mosaddegh was bombing mosques.
[01:07:46.795 --> 01:08:00.125]  Radical Muslims on the record were used by Hitler and then used in the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s and right through to today to overthrow secular regimes or regimes that the West did not like.
[01:08:00.794 --> 01:08:08.561]  And then, the bomb makers, the military, the social architects, then say, oh, now we've got Muslim extremists in there!
[01:08:08.561 --> 01:08:10.803]  Now we've got to have war with them!
[01:08:10.803 --> 01:08:19.130]  And so the West shoots down, repeatedly, their jetliners, and oh, we accidentally blew your jumbo jet full of women and children up.
[01:08:19.130 --> 01:08:28.378]  Oh, and then this year, and last year, the White House admitted what we told you five and a half years ago, what New Yorker Magazine told you four years ago, but we told you here first,
[01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:43.845]  That Wahhabist Sunnis, that's the group out of Saudi Arabia, 80% of the Muslim faith, but the Wahhabis is a tiny sect of those, radical, compared to the others.
[01:08:43.845 --> 01:08:48.390]  Backed up by British intelligence, created by British intelligence, Saudi Arabia was set up by it.
[01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:50.452]  This is on record in Lawrence of Arabia.
[01:08:53.359 --> 01:09:01.805]  The West spent over a hundred million dollars, according to the Washington Post, over a 20-year program, just shipping in U.S.
[01:09:01.805 --> 01:09:12.492]  printed textbooks radicalizing the Muslims in Central Asia, the Sunnis, in Pakistan, in India, in Afghanistan.
[01:09:12.492 --> 01:09:16.155]  This started in the 60s, so they would have them ready by the 80s.
[01:09:18.493 --> 01:09:19.514]  I mean, this is a fact!
[01:09:19.514 --> 01:09:20.795]  You can't debate this!
[01:09:20.795 --> 01:09:36.185]  The next time I have Atticaught on, I'm gonna do some pre-research and actually pull up all the articles, all the documents, so I can hit him with them, play the clips, or I'd mention the document and he would have to then admit and say, yeah, I'm against it, it's wrong.
[01:09:36.185 --> 01:09:39.768]  And so I'm gonna get him back on air, and I'm gonna just go through every one of them.
[01:09:39.768 --> 01:09:46.893]  Okay, uh, here's the Pentagon, uh, giving, uh, through the State Department, and the Pentagon State Department Program, Joint Program,
[01:09:47.924 --> 01:09:54.108]  Over a hundred million dollars of textbooks saying kill the infidels, kill the westerners, kill the communists.
[01:09:54.108 --> 01:09:59.231]  The kids learn to count three hand grenades plus two hand grenades equals five.
[01:09:59.231 --> 01:10:03.113]  Two machine guns plus eight machine guns equals ten machine guns.
[01:10:03.113 --> 01:10:07.516]  I mean, that's what our government did.
[01:10:07.516 --> 01:10:09.317]  That's how diabolical they are!
[01:10:13.118 --> 01:10:17.680]  The Muslims wanted big glistening hotels and shopping malls and fashion.
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:20.422]  They're totally worldly at the core.
[01:10:20.422 --> 01:10:24.944]  I mean, look, it's the cradle of civilization over there.
[01:10:24.944 --> 01:10:26.965]  And I'm not even saying all that's a good thing.
[01:10:26.965 --> 01:10:29.086]  The point is they want rock and roll and playboy.
[01:10:32.273 --> 01:10:34.795]  But the West doesn't want them on their own two feet.
[01:10:34.795 --> 01:10:36.536]  It's in the Royal Commission on Population.
[01:10:36.536 --> 01:10:37.737]  44 to 49.
[01:10:37.737 --> 01:10:40.058]  Put up with the British government.
[01:10:40.058 --> 01:10:42.060]  How do we stabilize nations?
[01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:43.801]  Put radical groups in control.
[01:10:43.801 --> 01:10:45.462]  Overthrow legitimate governments.
[01:10:45.462 --> 01:10:46.442]  De-stabilize.
[01:10:46.442 --> 01:10:50.145]  Then they say we can go in and counter them afterwards.
[01:10:50.145 --> 01:10:52.006]  See how that works?
[01:10:52.006 --> 01:10:53.988]  Don't let nations industrialize.
[01:10:53.988 --> 01:10:55.228]  Fund their neighbors.
[01:10:55.228 --> 01:11:01.853]  Fund inter-religious and inter-sect and inter-regional wars.
[01:11:04.159 --> 01:11:05.700]  This is the great game.
[01:11:05.700 --> 01:11:07.982]  This is what the global elite do.
[01:11:07.982 --> 01:11:09.724]  This is how they control people.
[01:11:09.724 --> 01:11:20.432]  Just like here, in the name of multiculturalism, all they hype up is our differences, and in the name of fighting that, all they do is make people be obsessed with it so we can't live in peace.
[01:11:20.432 --> 01:11:29.379]  Men against women, women against men, black against white, white against hispanic, hispanic against white, catholic against protestant, on and on and on and on.
[01:11:29.379 --> 01:11:31.481]  Divide and conquer.
[01:11:34.301 --> 01:11:44.984]  And then they take what Ahmed Dinejid, who I'm no fan of, has said, because he has incendiary rhetoric for his population.
[01:11:44.984 --> 01:11:51.686]  They take what he says and he says, if you attack us, we will push the Zionist regime into the sea.
[01:11:51.686 --> 01:11:59.228]  Then they, and this has been mainstream news, they falsified this, they, I will destroy, we will nuke Israel, we will blow you off the map.
[01:12:02.179 --> 01:12:07.263]  When in every case, the West says, we're going to use nukes on you.
[01:12:07.263 --> 01:12:08.404]  We're going to attack you.
[01:12:08.404 --> 01:12:14.509]  They'll put out a report saying, we're going to bomb with more than 10,000 Saudis.
[01:12:14.509 --> 01:12:17.411]  10,000 attacks with aircraft.
[01:12:17.411 --> 01:12:21.895]  And they say, okay, well if you do that, we're going to sink ships in the Strait of Hormuz.
[01:12:21.895 --> 01:12:23.997]  We're going to attack your aircraft carriers.
[01:12:23.997 --> 01:12:26.559]  We've got 11,000 long-range missiles.
[01:12:26.559 --> 01:12:29.982]  We're going to blow the Zionist regime off the map.
[01:12:31.886 --> 01:12:35.167]  We're going to push the Zionist regime into the sea.
[01:12:35.167 --> 01:12:38.389]  I mean, I don't want to be sucked into all this tribalism and sectarianism.
[01:12:38.389 --> 01:12:40.530]  I want everybody to live in peace.
[01:12:40.530 --> 01:12:41.690]  But that's not what's happening.
[01:12:41.690 --> 01:12:45.872]  I was talking to Atticott during the break, but he had to go teach a class.
[01:12:45.872 --> 01:12:49.314]  He's the head of that terrorism law school down there.
[01:12:51.741 --> 01:12:54.844]  And he was, like, breathing hard, going, I'm gonna tell you about the Muslims.
[01:12:54.844 --> 01:12:55.765]  They're gonna get us.
[01:12:55.765 --> 01:12:56.565]  They're gonna attack us.
[01:12:56.565 --> 01:12:57.266]  It's all real.
[01:12:57.266 --> 01:12:58.307]  It's about to happen.
[01:12:58.307 --> 01:12:59.848]  And Israel's gotta go into Iran.
[01:12:59.848 --> 01:13:04.072]  And when they do go into Iran, when they do go into Iran, it's gonna be hell.
[01:13:04.072 --> 01:13:05.393]  It's gonna break down everywhere.
[01:13:05.393 --> 01:13:06.434]  It's gonna be war everywhere.
[01:13:06.434 --> 01:13:08.636]  There's gonna be terrorism everywhere.
[01:13:08.636 --> 01:13:09.297]  Exactly.
[01:13:10.666 --> 01:13:17.387]  If the globalists attack Iran, folks, there are going to be real Shiite terror cells attacking all over the West.
[01:13:17.387 --> 01:13:21.948]  And then the globalists will stage big events and say that they're doing that as well.
[01:13:21.948 --> 01:13:34.231]  Now, we don't call it terrorism, but in the Cold War, the United States had sleeper cells, special forces, all over Europe, all over Latin America, all over Africa, all over the Soviet Union,
[01:13:36.897 --> 01:13:42.118]  The reports are they even smuggled nukes into these countries.
[01:13:42.118 --> 01:13:46.260]  The Russians got decapitation teams into here.
[01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:52.201]  This is what governments do!
[01:13:52.201 --> 01:13:59.703]  And I just report what the facts show, what the facts say, what the facts clearly reveal.
[01:13:59.703 --> 01:14:03.304]  We came up here last week on Tuesday's show, then went live again on Friday.
[01:14:03.304 --> 01:14:05.665]  We were saying we don't know if this is government sponsored.
[01:14:07.132 --> 01:14:13.517]  Uh, we said, uh, Pakistan has no kibono, no motive.
[01:14:13.517 --> 01:14:15.558]  Pakistan is begging, saying they didn't do it.
[01:14:15.558 --> 01:14:18.540]  They're investigating.
[01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:23.924]  Pakistan has the very same militants that India's claiming doing this.
[01:14:23.924 --> 01:14:29.228]  The Wahhabis inside their country, created by the United States, attacking them.
[01:14:29.228 --> 01:14:31.970]  The same groups trying to kill them every week.
[01:14:31.970 --> 01:14:34.592]  Bombing government buildings, killing government officials.
[01:14:34.592 --> 01:14:35.212]  I mean, it's real.
[01:14:35.212 --> 01:14:35.833]  They're killing them.
[01:14:36.641 --> 01:14:38.742]  Because they're trying to kick them out.
[01:14:38.742 --> 01:14:45.305]  And the Pakistanis are saying this is English, British, US, and Israeli controlled.
[01:14:45.305 --> 01:14:47.045]  We want them out.
[01:14:47.045 --> 01:14:48.006]  So we looked at the evidence.
[01:14:48.006 --> 01:14:50.307]  We watched it closely.
[01:14:50.307 --> 01:14:53.828]  And now it's in the Times of India today.
[01:14:53.828 --> 01:14:54.988]  And this could be a setup too.
[01:14:54.988 --> 01:14:57.229]  When you get a cloak and dagger, it's hard to know the truth.
[01:14:57.229 --> 01:15:04.552]  They were wearing Hindu-Zionist, there's a huge subsect of Hindu-Zionist, wristbands.
[01:15:04.552 --> 01:15:06.273]  They were on LSD, cocaine,
[01:15:07.492 --> 01:15:21.040]  and amphetamines and the head of India's anti-terror force had been in the newspapers saying elements of our own government in the radical Hindu group, the same ones that killed Mahatma Gandhi.
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:24.102]  He was a Hindu but he wouldn't go along with them in a war against Muslims.
[01:15:24.102 --> 01:15:27.244]  They're the ones that killed Gandhi!
[01:15:27.244 --> 01:15:35.069]  So, the head of the anti-terror force, who himself is a Hindu, went in the newspapers two weeks ago.
[01:15:35.069 --> 01:15:36.990]  We have these up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[01:15:37.771 --> 01:15:52.902]  And he said, our government just bombed the train station, he busted an army captain for doing it, a Hindu army captain, he was getting death threats, and as soon as he went in the hotel, at point blank range, the evidence now shows some of his own men killed him.
[01:15:52.902 --> 01:15:59.207]  And that's why, this is in the newspapers in India, the biggest ones!
[01:15:59.207 --> 01:16:06.973]  And then that's why the Indian police wouldn't fire back as the, quote, terrorists would walk 50 yards right in front of them.
[01:16:13.123 --> 01:16:21.387]  So see, all the evidence now shows this is a Western intelligence operation with Israel running it.
[01:16:21.387 --> 01:16:24.589]  We weren't sure if it was an inside job last week.
[01:16:24.589 --> 01:16:27.570]  Then we weren't sure if it was British, US, or Israeli.
[01:16:27.570 --> 01:16:32.133]  Now it has Israeli fingerprints all over it.
[01:16:32.133 --> 01:16:34.094]  And we just report the facts.
[01:16:37.068 --> 01:16:39.549]  We just report the facts here.
[01:16:39.549 --> 01:16:50.072]  And I don't like getting in the middle of Muslim, Serb, Croat, Serb, Shiite, Sunni, Hindu, Muslim.
[01:16:50.072 --> 01:16:51.152]  It's tribal warfare.
[01:16:51.152 --> 01:16:53.073]  All these sides are wrong.
[01:16:53.073 --> 01:16:57.514]  But the globalists manipulate and play all these sides off against each other.
[01:17:02.566 --> 01:17:11.408]  All the police that were killed in India were killed in suspicious circumstances away from the main combat areas and were killed execution style.
[01:17:11.408 --> 01:17:17.449]  It was all anti-terror heads that had busted the Indian Army staging terror.
[01:17:17.449 --> 01:17:19.289]  Blowing up a train a few months ago, killing 63.
[01:17:19.289 --> 01:17:20.689]  Was it 65?
[01:17:20.689 --> 01:17:22.209]  I don't know.
[01:17:22.209 --> 01:17:27.570]  Go pull it up.
[01:17:27.570 --> 01:17:30.991]  And now the Pakistani government is basically officially saying
[01:17:32.799 --> 01:17:36.820]  Look, our intelligence agency was set up by the British and the U.S.
[01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:38.441]  They're trying to kill us.
[01:17:38.441 --> 01:17:45.663]  The West is trying to overthrow our government, and they're staging terror attacks in India as a pretext to invade us.
[01:17:45.663 --> 01:17:47.464]  Please, we're not with the terrorists.
[01:17:47.464 --> 01:17:52.306]  Help us kick the Wahhabists out of here.
[01:17:52.306 --> 01:17:52.806]  You understand?
[01:17:54.488 --> 01:17:58.810]  And if you are a Sunni Muslim, I'm not attacking you either.
[01:17:58.810 --> 01:18:04.953]  The point is, they're manipulating all these groups so they can't have World War III.
[01:18:04.953 --> 01:18:07.214]  This is the great game, divide and conquer.
[01:18:07.214 --> 01:18:08.455]  We gotta get above all the names.
[01:18:09.130 --> 01:18:10.932]  The headlines are clear.
[01:18:10.932 --> 01:18:13.856]  The worldwide economic collapse is here.
[01:18:13.856 --> 01:18:17.081]  The military is being positioned for martial law.
[01:18:17.081 --> 01:18:18.823]  The mark of the beast is at hand.
[01:18:18.823 --> 01:18:22.147]  Governments are calling for a new world cashless economic system.
[01:18:22.147 --> 01:18:24.911]  Having a long-term food solution is your only hope.
[01:18:24.911 --> 01:18:25.772]  To stay free.
[01:18:26.793 --> 01:18:30.435]  Now, Survival of Seeds introduces their Escape the Beast Kit.
[01:18:30.435 --> 01:18:33.817]  24 varieties of all-natural, non-genetically modified heirloom seeds.
[01:18:33.817 --> 01:18:36.679]  For true patriots and homesteaders wanting food insurance.
[01:18:36.679 --> 01:18:41.322]  That's over 5 pounds of rare historic seeds for a penny per seed.

[01:19:11.737 --> 01:19:16.778]  Practically impossible for police to spot plates that have been treated with the reflective spray.
[01:19:16.778 --> 01:19:18.719]  The reflection blinded our camera.
[01:19:18.719 --> 01:19:20.059]  We are under the microscope.

[01:20:08.331 --> 01:20:10.272]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:20:10.272 --> 01:20:13.894]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:20:13.894 --> 01:20:16.355]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:20:16.355 --> 01:20:19.396]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:20:19.396 --> 01:20:25.119]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:20:25.119 --> 01:20:29.041]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[01:21:06.449 --> 01:21:07.190]  PrisonPlanet.TV
[01:21:09.412 --> 01:21:10.173]  Santa!
[01:21:10.173 --> 01:21:13.075]  Christmas Eve and you haven't left yet?
[01:21:13.075 --> 01:21:15.697]  Ho ho ho ho ho!
[01:21:15.697 --> 01:21:16.858]  No!
[01:21:16.858 --> 01:21:18.599]  I can't find my keys.
[01:21:18.599 --> 01:21:19.900]  Here's the perfect gift.

[01:21:41.515 --> 01:21:44.816]  And new for Christmas, there's even a Fofa just for eyeglasses.
[01:21:44.816 --> 01:21:47.017]  Where did I put my glasses, Mrs. Claus?
[01:21:48.052 --> 01:21:49.554]  Well, here they are!
[01:21:49.554 --> 01:21:53.338]  Luckily, Rudolph's nose isn't the only thing that lashes.

[01:22:18.891 --> 01:22:23.653]  There's a man going around taking names.
[01:22:23.653 --> 01:22:29.255]  And he decides who to free and who to blame.
[01:22:29.255 --> 01:22:33.917]  Everybody won't be treated all the same.
[01:22:33.917 --> 01:22:36.879]  There'll be a golden ladder reaching down.
[01:22:36.879 --> 01:22:40.380]  You know, I talk about giant antennas, people are like, what?
[01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:42.041]  Oh yeah, that's a huge sector over there.
[01:22:43.376 --> 01:22:44.637]  Like they're Zionist Christians.
[01:22:44.637 --> 01:22:49.780]  It's the biggest group of Christians in the United States.
[01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:55.724]  We've got social engineers that are Luciferians at the top, that are globalists.
[01:22:55.724 --> 01:22:56.524]  That is their religion.
[01:22:56.524 --> 01:22:58.225]  I've studied them.
[01:22:58.225 --> 01:23:02.668]  They play us all off against each other.
[01:23:02.668 --> 01:23:05.029]  Bob Chapman's coming up in about ten minutes.
[01:23:05.029 --> 01:23:08.011]  I wanted to get into some of the other news.
[01:23:08.011 --> 01:23:10.553]  Here's how they're going to sell us having troops on the streets of America.
[01:23:11.684 --> 01:23:16.445]  Now they've been setting this all up covertly, now exactly as we told you it's been announced.
[01:23:16.445 --> 01:23:25.767]  We're only going off their own documents and I told you they would sell it as putting a few thousand of the twenty thousand regular army troops on the border.
[01:23:25.767 --> 01:23:27.788]  They've already done that with the National Guard.
[01:23:27.788 --> 01:23:38.290]  They don't allow them to have rifles, they get chased scores of times, shot at, shot, running for Mexican troops that come in some cases three, four, five miles over the border.
[01:23:40.495 --> 01:23:44.917]  But they tell the public, oh the National Guard's now on the border.
[01:23:44.917 --> 01:23:48.838]  They claim they're going to build a thousand mile fence, they build fifty miles of it.
[01:23:48.838 --> 01:23:51.259]  Last time I checked it was what, fifty-four miles of them built.
[01:23:51.259 --> 01:23:52.740]  And they used illegal aliens to build it.
[01:23:52.740 --> 01:23:57.602]  You can Google the video or the photos of the new fence, it's already falling down.
[01:23:57.602 --> 01:24:00.443]  It's a joke.
[01:24:00.443 --> 01:24:05.625]  They put water pipes and ditches in it four feet tall for the people to crawl through.
[01:24:05.625 --> 01:24:09.967]  They put openings in it for the animals to quote, be able to migrate under environmental rules.
[01:24:11.220 --> 01:24:13.921]  It's all fake.
[01:24:13.921 --> 01:24:14.981]  And it's the same thing here.
[01:24:14.981 --> 01:24:16.121]  It's public relations.
[01:24:16.121 --> 01:24:16.461]  U.S.
[01:24:16.461 --> 01:24:21.902]  troops may be deployed in Arizona, southwest U.S.
[01:24:21.902 --> 01:24:23.302]  Phoenix Business Journal, U.S.
[01:24:23.302 --> 01:24:25.723]  Defense Department, plans to deploy as many as 20,000 U.S.
[01:24:25.723 --> 01:24:27.623]  troops within the U.S.
[01:24:27.623 --> 01:24:35.705]  for homeland security anti-terrorism efforts could result in a significant number being placed and having some kind of presence in Arizona and the southwest, according to security experts.
[01:24:38.206 --> 01:24:51.291]  They're acclimating the public this week in Arizona with foreign troops from all over the world, from more than 10 countries, Germany, England, Czechoslovakia, just on and on and on.
[01:24:51.291 --> 01:24:53.952]  They're doing takeover drills in Arizona.
[01:24:53.952 --> 01:24:54.752]  Google it.
[01:24:54.752 --> 01:24:56.733]  It was in the major newspapers.
[01:24:56.733 --> 01:24:59.234]  What was in the Tucson Star?
[01:24:59.234 --> 01:25:01.375]  Daily Star?
[01:25:01.375 --> 01:25:02.175]  What, a couple weeks ago?
[01:25:03.826 --> 01:25:06.269]  So see, everywhere you're going to hear this propaganda.
[01:25:06.269 --> 01:25:08.471]  Oh, the Army's here to help at car wrecks.
[01:25:08.471 --> 01:25:11.394]  They say that's in their plan for PR.
[01:25:11.394 --> 01:25:12.595]  Well, why aren't you for the Army?
[01:25:12.595 --> 01:25:14.197]  They're just here at car wrecks.
[01:25:14.197 --> 01:25:16.960]  They're here to helicopter out people hurt in car wrecks.
[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:19.302]  They're here to cut people out of cars.
[01:25:19.302 --> 01:25:25.949]  Oh, they're here to help your local bomb squad, you know, go see if a cardboard box downtown that fell out of a truck is a bomb.
[01:25:26.721 --> 01:25:32.607]  That's why they're giving IED, you know, Roadside Improvised Explosive Device training to every police department in the country.
[01:25:32.607 --> 01:25:37.132]  Every police department in the country is being given federal grants to have the feds come in.
[01:25:37.132 --> 01:25:39.235]  Oh, hi, we're the army, here to work with you!
[01:25:39.235 --> 01:25:43.599]  Because there's going to be terrorists everywhere with roadside bombs.
[01:25:43.599 --> 01:25:48.605]  But then when you really read what it's set up for, it's set up to suppress the American people.
[01:25:50.256 --> 01:25:54.999]  And Atticott, one of the senior, you know, experts on the inside of all this, admitted.
[01:25:54.999 --> 01:25:57.640]  He said, yes, it's for the American people.
[01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:04.423]  But he said, I know it's unconstitutional, I know it's bad, but Al-Qaeda, Al-Qaeda's gonna get us, Alex!
[01:26:04.423 --> 01:26:07.725]  And he was talking to me during breaks going, don't you understand how deadly they are?
[01:26:07.725 --> 01:26:08.966]  Don't you understand how real they are?
[01:26:09.696 --> 01:26:11.317]  And I didn't even argue with him.
[01:26:11.317 --> 01:26:17.620]  I'm going to have him back on and have all the mainstream news articles and WhiteHouse.gov, because he'll try to deny the media.
[01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:30.727]  WhiteHouse.gov admitted last year, remember I made a big deal out of it, saying, oh yes, we have hired these four groups to fight the insurgency on the Iranian border in eastern Iraq, western Iran.
[01:26:31.764 --> 01:26:37.086]  And we are funding them to carry out liberation movements inside Iran!
[01:26:37.086 --> 01:27:01.074]  The White House threw the gauntlet down to get Iran to shoot their mouths off again, and said, we are attacking Iran with, and he listed the four groups, and three of them were Wahhabist groups, and the main group, the mainstream news reported, was commanded by the number three in the FBI's list of the Al Qaeda hierarchy.
[01:27:02.236 --> 01:27:09.117]  And then Jeffrey Atikot comes on here and tells me that we're fighting Al-Qaeda.
[01:27:09.117 --> 01:27:11.538]  Funny, they used Al-Qaeda to attack the Serbs.
[01:27:11.538 --> 01:27:13.498]  They used Al-Qaeda to attack the Russians.
[01:27:13.498 --> 01:27:16.479]  They used Al-Qaeda to attack Iran.
[01:27:16.479 --> 01:27:19.500]  He was telling me during the break, he goes, but Iran will give a nuke to Al-Qaeda.
[01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:21.240]  Iran is Shiite!
[01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:26.381]  Shiites and Sunnis hate each other more than they supposedly don't like Christians.
[01:27:30.673 --> 01:27:33.115]  I mean, maybe Jeffrey Atticott doesn't know that.
[01:27:33.115 --> 01:27:36.598]  Maybe he doesn't really study this.
[01:27:36.598 --> 01:27:39.460]  But every point I made to him, he had to admit was true.
[01:27:39.460 --> 01:27:43.743]  I don't make anything up.
[01:27:43.743 --> 01:27:47.366]  So I'm sorry, this isn't cut and dry simple black and white folks for you.
[01:27:47.366 --> 01:27:50.688]  This is globalist intelligence operation against free humanity.
[01:27:50.688 --> 01:27:53.991]  Whether you're a Christian, a Jew, a Muslim, it doesn't matter.
[01:27:53.991 --> 01:27:56.933]  Whether you're an animist, they're coming after you.
[01:27:59.028 --> 01:28:02.955]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:02.955 --> 01:28:05.659]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:08.886 --> 01:28:12.327]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:28:12.327 --> 01:28:16.569]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:28:16.569 --> 01:28:28.233]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[01:28:28.233 --> 01:28:34.075]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[01:28:34.355 --> 01:28:39.018]  And germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[01:28:39.018 --> 01:28:47.223]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements, including colloidal silver, gold, and copper, with a money-back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[01:28:47.223 --> 01:28:54.888]  For four years, Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that would steal our God-given rights of health care and freedom of speech.

[01:29:08.666 --> 01:29:15.450]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:29:15.450 --> 01:29:18.092]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:29:18.092 --> 01:29:19.633]  But who is the enemy?
[01:29:19.633 --> 01:29:20.413]  Bin Laden.
[01:29:20.413 --> 01:29:21.374]  This is his MO.
[01:29:21.374 --> 01:29:22.815]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:29:22.815 --> 01:29:24.796]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:29:24.796 --> 01:29:31.520]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:32.420]  Some U.S.
[01:29:32.420 --> 01:29:38.762]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:29:38.762 --> 01:29:42.282]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:29:42.282 --> 01:29:52.745]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:29:52.745 --> 01:29:53.965]  Fabled Enemies.

[01:30:01.747 --> 01:30:05.074]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:30:08.982 --> 01:30:10.982]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:30:10.982 --> 01:30:17.944]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:30:17.944 --> 01:30:26.326]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:30:26.326 --> 01:30:32.047]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:30:32.467 --> 01:30:34.068]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:30:34.068 --> 01:30:36.369]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:30:36.369 --> 01:30:40.791]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:30:40.791 --> 01:30:43.012]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:30:43.012 --> 01:30:50.756]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[01:31:19.366 --> 01:31:21.527]  We've got a surprise guest in studio tomorrow morning.
[01:31:21.527 --> 01:31:25.970]  I'll just leave it at that for you.
[01:31:25.970 --> 01:31:34.075]  Major General Stubblebine will be joining us in the next hour with his wife, Dr. Labo, for a extended interview with us.
[01:31:34.075 --> 01:31:42.440]  We had her on briefly earlier in the week, talking about Codex Alimentarius, GMO foods, the mass eugenics program going on worldwide against free humanity.
[01:31:45.376 --> 01:31:46.857]  So that is coming up.
[01:31:46.857 --> 01:31:51.881]  Before we go to Bob Chapman for a brief 30 minute interview on the economy today.
[01:31:51.881 --> 01:32:01.407]  I am hardly even plugging books and videos and films that I've made or I carry at Infowars.com on the online video and book store these days.
[01:32:01.407 --> 01:32:03.809]  I'm so busy just covering the news.
[01:32:03.809 --> 01:32:06.971]  But these are such an important part of the fight, waking people up.
[01:32:06.971 --> 01:32:11.274]  The population is more ready, more apt, more
[01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:17.262]  Everything is more conducive to reaching out and educating people right now.
[01:32:17.262 --> 01:32:32.592]  The minds are very fertile right now to wake up to what the New World Order is doing, to wake up to what they're engaged in, to understand the fact that there's this overarching global technocracy that's in control.
[01:32:32.592 --> 01:32:37.875]  And so please, this Christmas season, this holiday season, don't procrastinate.
[01:32:39.790 --> 01:32:48.894]  Don't go fight the malls and the traffic and buy the fruitcakes or the ties or the robot toys that break in five minutes that nobody wants.
[01:32:48.894 --> 01:32:50.575]  Make Christmas cards for people.
[01:32:50.575 --> 01:32:51.736]  You know, bake fudge.
[01:32:51.736 --> 01:32:52.936]  You know, make fudge.
[01:32:52.936 --> 01:32:55.558]  There's fun stuff that's family.
[01:32:55.558 --> 01:33:00.880]  Go out in the local woods and cut some berries and holly and stuff and put that in your house.
[01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:04.322]  You know, that's what I did with my children.
[01:33:04.322 --> 01:33:07.864]  I mean, we have more depression, more suicides, people go into debt at Christmas.
[01:33:07.864 --> 01:33:08.424]  Just don't do it.
[01:33:09.884 --> 01:33:10.804]  Get back to basics.
[01:33:10.804 --> 01:33:18.688]  But if you're going to go spend money, why not give the gift of reality, the gift of truth, the gift of information, the gift of awakening?
[01:33:18.688 --> 01:33:20.589]  Unlocking minds.
[01:33:20.589 --> 01:33:23.631]  And the best place to do that is InfoWars.com.
[01:33:23.631 --> 01:33:26.252]  You can get all the DVDs, the books, the film.
[01:33:26.252 --> 01:33:28.293]  Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:33:29.798 --> 01:33:32.199]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:33:32.199 --> 01:33:38.763]  My two best-made, most powerful films, in my opinion, on overall information about the New World Order, the Master Plan.
[01:33:38.763 --> 01:33:43.065]  Truth Rising, just incredible activism and adventure.
[01:33:43.065 --> 01:33:46.167]  I mean, it's a great watch, not just powerful info.
[01:33:47.390 --> 01:33:50.111]  Just go to mfallwars.com and order the books and DVDs.
[01:33:50.111 --> 01:34:03.437]  If you're in international orders, if you are outside North America, you need to get your orders in by tomorrow to be guaranteed to get it well before Christmas.
[01:34:03.437 --> 01:34:14.361]  And if you're going to be ordering to get it before Christmas here in the United States, guaranteed, with the UPS we use, ground, you need to order by the 17th.
[01:34:14.361 --> 01:34:15.842]  So time is running out.
[01:34:16.810 --> 01:34:20.151]  And I can think of no better gift than a Terror Storm or an Endgame.
[01:34:20.151 --> 01:34:23.212]  Beautiful packaging, you know, reads like an adventure movie on the back.
[01:34:23.212 --> 01:34:26.012]  You know, that's good to get people to watch it.
[01:34:26.012 --> 01:34:28.973]  Well-produced, you know, slickly done.
[01:34:28.973 --> 01:34:31.294]  Key information.
[01:34:31.294 --> 01:34:38.176]  But I don't care if you take my films like Endgame or Terror Storm or Truth Rising and just make copies of them for stocking stuffers.
[01:34:38.176 --> 01:34:40.096]  I just want people to have this information.
[01:34:40.096 --> 01:34:42.757]  But they're more... more apt to watch it.
[01:34:43.769 --> 01:34:44.950]  Even if it's an original.
[01:34:44.950 --> 01:34:45.930]  And we have big discounts.
[01:34:45.930 --> 01:34:54.535]  You get my films as low as like five bucks a piece when you buy them in bulk at InfoWars.com or call toll free and ask them about the combos and specials.
[01:34:54.535 --> 01:34:54.975]  888-253-3139.
[01:34:54.975 --> 01:34:55.195]  888-253-3139.
[01:34:55.195 --> 01:34:58.376]  And the best deal of this Christmas season is holiday.
[01:34:58.376 --> 01:35:04.600]  And I don't care if you're not a Christian, still give somebody the gift of truth.
[01:35:12.933 --> 01:35:14.914]  It's PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:35:14.914 --> 01:35:24.860]  All 20 of my films, hundreds and hundreds of weekly TV reports, special reports on every issue from health to martial law to the police state to the CPS.
[01:35:24.860 --> 01:35:26.461]  Get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[01:35:26.461 --> 01:35:29.443]  Peruse through the thousands of videos and audios.
[01:35:29.443 --> 01:35:31.144]  Four and a half years up and running.
[01:35:31.144 --> 01:35:35.847]  It's now in super high quality, delivered by high-powered servers.
[01:35:35.847 --> 01:35:37.488]  Always quick, easy, fast.
[01:35:37.488 --> 01:35:38.969]  Takes a minute to sign up.
[01:35:38.969 --> 01:35:39.849]  $5.95 a month.
[01:35:39.849 --> 01:35:40.650]  Get a passcode.
[01:35:41.587 --> 01:35:51.031]  No, your username and passcode, and you can share that with three or four people in your family, put it in a card, say, hey, I gave you a membership to a really cool movie site.
[01:35:51.031 --> 01:35:56.534]  It's PrisonPlanet.TV, and, you know, here's your passcode and username.
[01:35:56.534 --> 01:36:07.158]  Make it simple, make it easy, make it holiday name, make it freedom name, whatever, and give it to them, and then even if they, on the off chance, weren't going to use it, most of them will, you've got a membership.
[01:36:07.158 --> 01:36:08.299]  Give yourself a membership,
[01:36:09.392 --> 01:36:14.096]  Give us a little bit of cash to be able to operate and expand and continue what we're doing, especially in these hard times.
[01:36:14.096 --> 01:36:16.098]  It's hard on everybody.
[01:36:16.098 --> 01:36:18.220]  And give the gift of knowledge and information.
[01:36:18.220 --> 01:36:19.962]  So prisonplanet.tv.
[01:36:19.962 --> 01:36:22.064]  I'll tell you something else that's good to give.
[01:36:23.624 --> 01:36:25.525]  Give somebody the International Forecaster.
[01:36:25.525 --> 01:36:29.707]  Go to www.TheInternationalForecaster.com and do that as well because it's an info war.
[01:36:29.707 --> 01:36:38.591]  And some people, you know, in COINTELPRO from the 60s and 70s, declassified FBI program, how would they criticize activist groups?
[01:36:38.591 --> 01:36:40.652]  Second Amendment groups?
[01:36:40.652 --> 01:36:41.853]  Black liberation groups?
[01:36:43.173 --> 01:36:54.124]  Environmental rights groups, Native American groups, anybody who tried to write books, make documentaries, start a newsletter, they would criticize them and put agents into their midst and say, you're making money, you're not supposed to.
[01:36:54.124 --> 01:36:58.027]  Let me make it clear for everybody.
[01:36:58.027 --> 01:36:59.669]  It's good to make money.
[01:36:59.669 --> 01:37:00.149]  It's good.
[01:37:00.149 --> 01:37:07.917]  We need to have nice offices and cameras and equipment and be able to fly people in and do interviews and bring you better, slicker information.
[01:37:09.073 --> 01:37:09.813]  I mean, what a joke!
[01:37:09.813 --> 01:37:28.221]  The mainstream media, the government, takes our money, uses it against us, takes our money in taxes, uses it as propaganda against the public, and then has the nerve to tell us that we shouldn't have websites, that we shouldn't have advertisers, that we shouldn't be able to fight the New World Order.
[01:37:28.221 --> 01:37:30.282]  What matters is the information we're putting out.
[01:37:30.282 --> 01:37:33.144]  So, I'm going to tell you, I want you to buy the books, the videos.
[01:37:33.144 --> 01:37:38.486]  I've never really asked for this in the past, but it's helped us grow so much since we finally did it, that if you want to just give us donations,
[01:37:40.811 --> 01:37:47.255]  Write it to Alex Jones, and I assure you, 90% of it will be spent in the fight.
[01:37:47.255 --> 01:37:49.937]  And the other 10% will be spent in the fight as well.
[01:37:49.937 --> 01:37:53.399]  For the t-shirt on my back, the shoes on my feet, and food for my children.
[01:37:53.399 --> 01:37:56.941]  Because I do this full time, because I have the capital to do it.
[01:37:56.941 --> 01:37:59.163]  And I will hire more people.
[01:37:59.163 --> 01:38:01.624]  I will hire high caliber people.
[01:38:01.624 --> 01:38:04.066]  We will do even better, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:38:05.157 --> 01:38:08.698]  So it's a mind game that they've trained us that we can't have organizations.
[01:38:08.698 --> 01:38:09.898]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:38:09.898 --> 01:38:12.238]  Of course we have to have funds.
[01:38:12.238 --> 01:38:13.859]  Of course we do.
[01:38:13.859 --> 01:38:15.419]  That's ridiculous.
[01:38:15.419 --> 01:38:19.800]  We're supposed to sit down under a bridge yelling at cars as they drive by.
[01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:20.440]  No.
[01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:21.280]  We're moving out.
[01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:22.240]  We're fighting the New World Order.
[01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:23.420]  We're trying to win.
[01:38:23.420 --> 01:38:25.661]  We've got winner's attitudes.
[01:38:25.661 --> 01:38:28.661]  So please get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership today.
[01:38:28.661 --> 01:38:31.082]  Not only is the info key to saving the Republic,
[01:38:31.923 --> 01:38:33.784]  It funds this whole operation.
[01:38:33.784 --> 01:38:36.244]  You get five months free right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:38:36.244 --> 01:38:45.268]  Okay, I'm going to go to Bob now for five minutes into the next hour, so he's got about 25 minutes here on air, and then we'll also get our next guest on.
[01:38:45.268 --> 01:38:47.968]  We're on with this for about an hour and 30 minutes today.
[01:38:47.968 --> 01:38:55.211]  Bob Chapman, the international forecaster, really needs no introduction here, but you can read his bio.
[01:38:55.211 --> 01:39:00.713]  I think overall it's another governmental U.S.
[01:39:08.433 --> 01:39:10.014]  ...saving the Republic.
[01:39:10.014 --> 01:39:11.875]  It funds this whole operation.
[01:39:11.875 --> 01:39:14.296]  You get five months free right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:39:14.296 --> 01:39:23.341]  Okay, I'm gonna go to Bob now for five minutes into the next hour, so he's got about 25 minutes here on air, and then we'll also get our next guest on.
[01:39:23.341 --> 01:39:26.042]  They're on with us for about an hour and 30 minutes today.
[01:39:26.042 --> 01:39:30.545]  Bob Chapman, the international forecaster, really needs no introduction here, but you can read his bio.
[01:39:30.545 --> 01:39:31.105]  It's another
[01:39:32.063 --> 01:39:34.364]  Governmental U.S.
[01:39:34.364 --> 01:39:36.585]  Mossad operation.
[01:39:36.585 --> 01:39:44.667]  And, uh, but I quite frankly don't have enough information to intelligently say... Well, just to be clear, you were in intelligence for a long time and you're right.
[01:39:44.667 --> 01:39:51.890]  It's now come out, the Indian government, Times of India, the Pakistani government is saying they staged an attack
[01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:54.071]  Well, that's to be expected and uh...
[01:40:15.763 --> 01:40:24.850]  What the end result, probably just a method of keeping people's eye off of more important things that are going on.
[01:40:24.850 --> 01:40:26.411]  Exactly.
[01:40:26.411 --> 01:40:33.277]  Just to start off with, the whole world is sinking into severe recession.
[01:40:33.277 --> 01:40:36.039]  And it's just not the United States and Europe.
[01:40:36.039 --> 01:40:41.883]  This whole world's going, the Chinese are devaluing their currency by about 7% again.
[01:40:41.883 --> 01:40:43.645]  I mean, we have got to institute
[01:40:44.801 --> 01:40:49.547]  Trade tariffs on everything.
[01:40:49.547 --> 01:40:52.270]  And that means goods and services.
[01:40:52.270 --> 01:40:59.018]  These countries continue to denigrate their currency so that they can ship
[01:40:59.505 --> 01:41:02.366]  Competitive or cheap goods to the United States.
[01:41:02.366 --> 01:41:08.208]  I mean, the Mexican peso just went down from 9.30 to almost 14.
[01:41:08.208 --> 01:41:10.789]  Well, let's explain this.
[01:41:10.789 --> 01:41:13.810]  They call it free and fair trade, but no environmental standards.
[01:41:13.810 --> 01:41:17.132]  You know, a dollar an hour or less in China.
[01:41:17.132 --> 01:41:19.352]  And their currency's way under ours.
[01:41:19.352 --> 01:41:21.673]  There's no way to compete with that.
[01:41:21.673 --> 01:41:27.716]  And so tariffs are what built this country until we got rid of them in the last 50 years or so.
[01:41:27.716 --> 01:41:28.576]  But shifting gears,
[01:41:29.076 --> 01:41:33.417]  Let's get back into that, but we only have a little bit of time with you, Bob, so I want to give you quick questions, quick answers.
[01:41:33.417 --> 01:41:40.660]  Bloomberg and AP are reporting now $8.4 trillion stolen by the bankers, but the bankers are just giving cash totals.
[01:41:40.660 --> 01:41:43.480]  They're not saying where it's going.
[01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:47.021]  So $8.4 trillion in seven weeks, Bob.
[01:41:47.021 --> 01:41:49.502]  What is that going to do?
[01:41:49.502 --> 01:41:58.585]  It's going to keep the banks, the insurance companies, the brokerage firms, the equity people, and special situations like
[01:41:59.733 --> 01:42:07.315]  The automobile industry, General Electric, it's going to keep them alive for a while.
[01:42:07.315 --> 01:42:09.416]  And what they're doing is borrowing time.
[01:42:09.416 --> 01:42:13.897]  Evidently, now is not the time to bring the whole thing down and collapse it.
[01:42:13.897 --> 01:42:16.838]  It's obviously some date in the future.
[01:42:16.838 --> 01:42:23.259]  By what I see, and as you know, two and a half months ago, we projected $10 trillion plus.
[01:42:23.259 --> 01:42:25.380]  Everybody else is just catching up.
[01:42:25.380 --> 01:42:29.101]  And now I look at it, at the rate they're going, they may be looking at $20 trillion.
[01:42:30.366 --> 01:42:40.214]  It is just unbelievable, and today they've recommended another trillion dollars to kick-start the economy.
[01:42:40.214 --> 01:42:50.041]  This is going to blow inflation right through the roof, because that's far more than you need to offset the inherent asset deflation that's going on.
[01:42:50.041 --> 01:42:55.986]  And so inflation's going to go crazy, starting probably about February, March, April, again.
[01:42:56.710 --> 01:42:58.891]  I mean, it's already at twelve and a half percent.
[01:42:58.891 --> 01:43:03.313]  We're looking at it going over twenty percent.
[01:43:03.313 --> 01:43:05.714]  Unbelievable.
[01:43:05.714 --> 01:43:06.854]  They're being so secretive.
[01:43:06.854 --> 01:43:08.095]  I mean, imagine.
[01:43:08.095 --> 01:43:13.077]  Eight point four trillion stolen in right under seven weeks.
[01:43:13.077 --> 01:43:16.438]  And then now, Bob, they've announced what we already knew.
[01:43:16.438 --> 01:43:19.979]  Total abolishment of the National Guard under federal control.
[01:43:19.979 --> 01:43:22.780]  The governors will serve at the pleasure of the president.
[01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:24.021]  Troops on the streets of America.
[01:43:25.307 --> 01:43:39.774]  Yes, I reported on the Wednesday issue, and one of the things that came out a week or two ago, and I really, it didn't dent my head as to how important it was, but we are looking at another bubble.
[01:43:39.774 --> 01:43:41.475]  Now, the bubble is beginning.
[01:43:41.475 --> 01:43:44.376]  It began perhaps about six months ago.
[01:43:44.376 --> 01:43:46.457]  FHA.
[01:43:46.457 --> 01:43:54.601]  These are the loans that are given by government for people who want to borrow to either stay in their homes or get new homes.
[01:43:56.215 --> 01:43:57.936]  They have $300 billion.
[01:43:57.936 --> 01:44:01.317]  They'll go through that lickety split.
[01:44:01.317 --> 01:44:18.544]  Now, the people who are placing these loans, the loan originators, are the same gang, 35,000 of them, that have licenses now to do this with the FHA, to write these loans.
[01:44:18.544 --> 01:44:19.945]  This is the same gang.
[01:44:21.041 --> 01:44:31.806]  That wrote the subprime loans and the ALTA loans, lied on the applications, forged the applications... Well, look at who Obama's bringing in.
[01:44:31.806 --> 01:44:42.670]  I mean, as bad as Bush was, the economic team of Obama is the exact people that got rid of the Glass-Steagall Act and actually set all this up in the 90s.
[01:44:42.670 --> 01:44:43.891]  That's right.
[01:44:43.891 --> 01:44:49.353]  And, so what's going to happen is that they're going to continue to increase the money
[01:44:50.498 --> 01:45:07.288]  Congress will, that they give to the FHA, and they're gonna give all these loans out to people again, who should not have them, and two years from now, three years from now, we're gonna have another problem like we just had over the last two years with those two kinds of loans.
[01:45:07.288 --> 01:45:08.328]  But let's be clear!
[01:45:08.328 --> 01:45:17.994]  And many, many of the people, Alex, many of them, who are writing these loans, have criminal records in that field.
[01:45:19.099 --> 01:45:21.920]  And, you know, the government doesn't want to know about it.
[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:27.921]  They just want people to either stay in homes, or buy new homes, to temporarily solve the problem.
[01:45:27.921 --> 01:45:28.841]  They don't care!
[01:45:28.841 --> 01:45:30.341]  But let's explain.
[01:45:30.341 --> 01:45:32.882]  It's not just that these loans are going to go bad.
[01:45:32.882 --> 01:45:35.682]  It's that they're leveraging and securitizing them.
[01:45:35.682 --> 01:45:37.863]  They're selling the debt.
[01:45:37.863 --> 01:45:38.183]  Again.
[01:45:38.183 --> 01:45:40.083]  And the U.S.
[01:45:40.083 --> 01:45:45.924]  government is buying it, and it's 100% insured and guaranteed by the American taxpayer.
[01:45:45.924 --> 01:45:48.045]  And that means the leveraging is guaranteed.
[01:45:50.612 --> 01:45:58.214]  Incidentally, I am the only writer that I've read, and I do over 350 pieces of research a day.
[01:45:58.214 --> 01:46:03.175]  In fact, I fall asleep at 7.30 and 8 o'clock at night and get up at 3 in the morning.
[01:46:03.175 --> 01:46:09.496]  And I have seen nobody else come out with that, and it was so simple.
[01:46:09.496 --> 01:46:10.037]  No, I understand.
[01:46:10.037 --> 01:46:11.997]  There's all sorts of little bubble scams going.
[01:46:11.997 --> 01:46:15.798]  Well, they're using the bailout money to go start new bubble leveraging operations.
[01:46:17.080 --> 01:46:17.881]  That's for sure.
[01:46:17.881 --> 01:46:20.082]  That's in the banking and the brokerage community.
[01:46:20.082 --> 01:46:28.087]  Okay, now... I mean, there was this one firm that just received, a mutual fund firm, just received $2 billion, so they're laying off people.
[01:46:28.717 --> 01:46:30.880]  Yeah, I want to shift gears.
[01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:32.321]  I want to shift gears.
[01:46:32.321 --> 01:46:39.690]  Because, yeah, they implode the economy, then they become flush with cash, and they leverage it in derivatives, again, to dominate and buy everything up.
[01:46:39.690 --> 01:46:43.555]  Leverage, leaving us holding the bag when that new bubble implodes.
[01:46:43.555 --> 01:46:45.838]  Then they'll terrorize us into more bailouts then.
[01:46:47.379 --> 01:46:50.061]  But stop right there about this, we don't have a lot of time and I want to get to this.
[01:46:50.061 --> 01:46:57.708]  I have police, firemen, school teachers, they're being told that they've lost 30, 40, 50% of their 401Ks in investments.
[01:46:57.708 --> 01:47:05.114]  The government's now talking about taking that over to quote, save it, but then taxing it and then only sending you a smaller amount.
[01:47:05.114 --> 01:47:12.339]  And we've got Harvard saying, you know, they've lost $8 billion out of their pension funds.
[01:47:12.339 --> 01:47:13.000]  Where is this going?
[01:47:15.047 --> 01:47:33.919]  Well, I hope nowhere, but there has been people who have spoken before Congress promulgating, creating ideas which are exactly what you've said, and whether Congress will act upon that in that way, I don't know, but I want to tell you one thing.
[01:47:33.919 --> 01:47:38.582]  If they make moves in that direction, all of you who can,
[01:47:40.021 --> 01:47:45.804]  Want to liquidate your IRAs and your 401ks and so on and so forth.
[01:47:45.804 --> 01:47:56.868]  There are some retirement plans you can't liquidate without losing your job, but we even see people quitting their jobs just to get a hold of their 401ks because they lost so much money.
[01:47:56.868 --> 01:48:02.971]  And the stock market is going to continue to go down, irrespective of the manipulation that's going on.
[01:48:02.971 --> 01:48:07.232]  Okay, when are they going to know when to get out of their retirement plans?
[01:48:07.232 --> 01:48:08.233]  I will know, believe me.
[01:48:09.724 --> 01:48:12.325]  Well, I mean, they're already being decimated.
[01:48:12.325 --> 01:48:16.027]  What's going to happen to the retirement?
[01:48:16.027 --> 01:48:18.048]  Continued decimation.
[01:48:18.048 --> 01:48:23.891]  Unless they get into gold and silver-related assets.
[01:48:23.891 --> 01:48:30.974]  I mean, some people have moved the money market funds, and some people have gold and silver mutual funds available to them.
[01:48:30.974 --> 01:48:33.235]  Some people can buy gold and silver coins.
[01:48:33.235 --> 01:48:34.356]  It all depends on the plan.
[01:48:35.253 --> 01:48:42.738]  And that's why when I help people I say, look you gotta email me and give me my phone number because I've got to talk to you.
[01:48:42.738 --> 01:48:48.402]  I can't put you into something or tell you what to do when it's unsuitable for you.
[01:48:48.402 --> 01:48:51.965]  What's good for Alex is not good for Bob.
[01:48:51.965 --> 01:48:54.527]  And what's good for Sally isn't good for Dave necessarily.
[01:48:55.214 --> 01:48:55.775]  That's right.
[01:48:55.775 --> 01:48:58.901]  All right, final segment with Bob Chapman straight ahead.
[01:48:58.901 --> 01:49:03.288]  The design implosion is going quite well for the bankers.
[01:49:03.288 --> 01:49:07.235]  Seven weeks in, 8.4 trillion and counting a couple hundred billion a day.
[01:49:10.503 --> 01:49:12.864]  The holidays are right around the corner.
[01:49:12.864 --> 01:49:20.388]  The crowds, the countless hours in traffic, finding a parking spot just to buy a gift you're worried they might not like anyway.
[01:49:20.388 --> 01:49:25.451]  How about surprising your loved ones with a gift they can use every day of the year?

[01:50:09.851 --> 01:50:15.596]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[01:50:15.596 --> 01:50:16.837]  And we knew what to do.
[01:50:17.605 --> 01:50:18.886]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:50:18.886 --> 01:50:25.935]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:50:25.935 --> 01:50:31.100]  Whitman, EPA Director on the 18th made a statement.
[01:50:32.062 --> 01:50:34.485]  That the air was safe to breathe.
[01:50:34.485 --> 01:50:36.588]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:50:36.588 --> 01:50:38.891]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[01:50:50.846 --> 01:50:53.949]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[01:51:02.916 --> 01:51:07.840]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[01:51:09.500 --> 01:51:11.742]  How much food do you have in your fridge?
[01:51:11.742 --> 01:51:14.805]  How long would it last in the event of a nationwide crisis?

[01:52:00.737 --> 01:52:02.959]  What if I say I'm not like the others?
[01:52:02.959 --> 01:52:04.981]  What if I say I'm not just another part of your place?
[01:52:04.981 --> 01:52:05.881]  You're the presenter.
[01:52:20.948 --> 01:52:22.310]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:52:22.310 --> 01:52:22.610]  to 3 p.m.
[01:52:22.610 --> 01:52:23.631]  Central Center Time.
[01:52:23.631 --> 01:52:24.892]  We are live!
[01:52:24.892 --> 01:52:26.614]  Blasting out on the M&M's and dials.
[01:52:26.614 --> 01:52:28.516]  Simulcasting on the internet at infoware.com.
[01:52:28.516 --> 01:52:32.360]  Global shortwave at WWCR and on satellite.
[01:52:33.931 --> 01:52:42.159]  Not to mention, over 115,000 people downloading the free podcast every day at InfoWars.com.
[01:52:42.159 --> 01:52:51.628]  Very exciting, because our growth curve, within one year, will have us at over 400,000 people downloading the podcast at current growth rates.
[01:52:51.628 --> 01:52:53.070]  So keep spreading the word.
[01:52:54.851 --> 01:52:56.213]  We will never surrender!
[01:52:56.213 --> 01:53:08.903]  Bob Chapman, the good news is the people are really waking up because you and I and many others, you going back 45 years, folks don't know he's one of the granddaddies of the Patriot movement, the old guard that really got everything going.
[01:53:08.903 --> 01:53:15.809]  Everything we've said has come true about the military, the troops, the staged terror, the bankers stealing, openly announcing world government.
[01:53:15.809 --> 01:53:18.432]  So right now, people are ready to listen to us.
[01:53:18.432 --> 01:53:21.995]  We need the folks out there to become leaders and take action, Bob.
[01:53:23.172 --> 01:53:24.553]  Absolutely.
[01:53:24.553 --> 01:53:32.098]  And we need more people coming on the air and doing programs like this and writing publications that expose what's going on.
[01:53:32.098 --> 01:53:38.682]  All too many of the people who are writing are afraid to go to the heart of the problem.
[01:53:38.682 --> 01:53:52.612]  They're afraid to name the Illuminists and the Zionists and these phony events that they have, such as we just saw in Mumbai, and say that the government lies.
[01:53:55.563 --> 01:54:03.109]  It's amazing, Bob, but again, people are waking up across the board to what's happening.
[01:54:03.109 --> 01:54:05.911]  I'm very happy about it, believe me.
[01:54:05.911 --> 01:54:23.626]  Well, it's very exciting, but what's scary is you find out that 90% of the public, whether they're a Muslim, a Christian, a Jew, a Hindu, they have no idea what's going on, and then once you show them, it makes perfect sense to them, and then they understand how we're all being manipulated against each other.
[01:54:26.340 --> 01:54:28.201]  That's absolutely correct.
[01:54:28.201 --> 01:54:35.663]  And that's part of their program, that's part of the propagandizing, the psychological warfare that goes along with this whole thing.
[01:54:35.663 --> 01:54:41.825]  Especially pitting people against one another and infiltrating organizations, which I've seen for years and years and years.
[01:54:43.191 --> 01:54:45.653]  Bob, we've only got a few minutes and then we're going to break for one minute.
[01:54:45.653 --> 01:54:48.175]  I'm going to take you back for just two minutes on the other side.
[01:54:48.175 --> 01:54:48.695]  Gold.
[01:54:48.695 --> 01:54:54.259]  I want to talk about gold and what the COMEX is, for those that don't know, and how they're manipulating it.
[01:54:54.259 --> 01:54:56.941]  And, you know, it's moved up almost $100 in the last few weeks.
[01:54:56.941 --> 01:54:59.263]  Where do you see it going?
[01:54:59.263 --> 01:55:05.987]  I think we're going to base out again for the fifth time in the area somewhere between $7 and $7.50.
[01:55:05.987 --> 01:55:09.470]  And it's in that realm right now.
[01:55:10.470 --> 01:55:15.794]  The United States government is deliberately suppressing the gold price in here.
[01:55:15.794 --> 01:55:28.964]  And the reason why is they're trying to scare the people who have gold on deposit at the ComEx into putting it into what they call registered form.
[01:55:29.790 --> 01:55:35.818]  Available for delivery against people who have contracts who want delivery.
[01:55:35.818 --> 01:55:43.328]  And the reason why is that a lot of people are taking delivery of gold and heretofore perhaps 1% did.
[01:55:44.739 --> 01:55:46.580]  No, there's a lot more than that.
[01:55:46.580 --> 01:55:52.542]  Some of the early figures from Friday, Monday, Tuesday, I have in the publication.
[01:55:52.542 --> 01:55:54.162]  More are coming in.
[01:55:54.162 --> 01:55:58.684]  Figures of people taking delivery of their goal, large amounts.
[01:55:58.684 --> 01:56:01.285]  Not the average person does this.
[01:56:01.285 --> 01:56:06.727]  And they're putting pressure on what has become a two-tier market.
[01:56:06.727 --> 01:56:10.728]  The COMEX is being controlled and manipulated by the United States government.
[01:56:11.758 --> 01:56:22.327]  People who are trading on there, speculators and traders, even commercials, which are the pros pros, they're leaving there and they're not participating.
[01:56:22.327 --> 01:56:24.169]  The open contracts have dropped from $625,000 to $264,000.
[01:56:24.169 --> 01:56:24.729]  That's incredible!
[01:56:31.727 --> 01:56:39.589]  The physical market is going to win and we may have a default on the comics because they don't have enough gold to deliver against the contracts.
[01:56:39.589 --> 01:56:42.930]  So right now is a huge buying opportunity?
[01:56:42.930 --> 01:56:43.830]  Absolutely.
[01:56:43.830 --> 01:56:44.610]  Stay there, Bob.
[01:56:44.610 --> 01:56:51.892]  Back in 70 seconds to finish up our talk.
[01:56:51.892 --> 01:56:54.372]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:56:54.372 --> 01:56:56.693]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:57:00.026 --> 01:57:06.787]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:57:06.787 --> 01:57:09.428]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:57:09.428 --> 01:57:10.968]  But who is the enemy?
[01:57:10.968 --> 01:57:11.749]  Bin Laden.
[01:57:11.749 --> 01:57:12.709]  This is his ammo.
[01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:14.149]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:57:14.149 --> 01:57:16.189]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:57:16.189 --> 01:57:22.851]  Enabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:57:23.271 --> 01:57:23.751]  Some U.S.
[01:57:23.751 --> 01:57:30.113]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:57:30.113 --> 01:57:33.613]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:57:33.613 --> 01:57:44.076]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:57:44.076 --> 01:57:45.316]  Fabled enemies.
[01:57:45.316 --> 01:57:51.858]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:57:53.078 --> 01:57:56.439]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists!
[01:58:12.885 --> 01:58:14.186]  Big Brother.
[01:58:14.186 --> 01:58:15.947]  Mainstream media.
[01:58:15.947 --> 01:58:17.708]  Government cover-ups.
[01:58:17.708 --> 01:58:19.289]  You want answers?
[01:58:19.289 --> 01:58:20.851]  Well, so does he.
[01:58:20.851 --> 01:58:25.033]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:25.033 --> 01:58:29.496]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:29.496 --> 01:58:37.402]  Major General Stubblebine and Dr. Lebo will be joining us coming up for the next hour and 45 minutes or so, until the end of the show.
[01:58:39.292 --> 01:58:40.693]  A lot of other key news coming up.
[01:58:40.693 --> 01:58:44.735]  I'm finishing up, Bob, in non-technical terms.
[01:58:44.735 --> 01:58:47.797]  Bob, manipulating the gold paper market, they keep trying to hold it down.
[01:58:47.797 --> 01:58:53.360]  But now I'm seeing all these, I mean hundreds of them, on CNBC and everywhere saying gold 2000, gold 2000.
[01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:54.701]  I don't even want to say that.
[01:58:55.499 --> 01:59:04.702]  Why are they having all these bigwigs on TV if it's so controlled, saying it's going up to 2,000 and now even admitting in a lot of places that the COMEX is manipulated?
[01:59:04.702 --> 01:59:10.484]  I mean, because normally I like to go the opposite direction of what the big boys are saying.
[01:59:10.484 --> 01:59:11.725]  I mean, we know it's manipulated.
[01:59:11.725 --> 01:59:15.206]  We know it should be over 2,000, but what's going to happen?
[01:59:15.206 --> 01:59:23.869]  I think they're letting you know that they know that the government is going to probably end their manipulation.
[01:59:23.869 --> 01:59:24.869]  I think that's what's coming.
[01:59:25.512 --> 01:59:29.913]  And they're hoping to set a lid on this thing at $2,000.
[01:59:29.913 --> 01:59:37.874]  If you go back to 1980, and you figure official inflation, you're looking at close to $3,000.
[01:59:37.874 --> 01:59:40.235]  Unofficial inflation is $6,000.
[01:59:40.235 --> 01:59:45.416]  Since that time, that's what gold should be and should go to.
[01:59:45.416 --> 01:59:47.916]  That's on a natural basis.
[01:59:47.916 --> 01:59:49.876]  And so they don't want it to go there.
[01:59:49.876 --> 01:59:52.277]  And obviously, they're happy to keep it at $2,000.
[01:59:53.846 --> 01:59:56.267]  They're trying to build a bridge there.
[01:59:56.267 --> 01:59:58.228]  They're trying to build a buffer.
[01:59:58.228 --> 02:00:00.449]  They're trying to stop it from going there.
[02:00:00.449 --> 02:00:05.211]  I know right now it seems strange, because gold is down in the 700s.
[02:00:05.211 --> 02:00:07.832]  But let me tell you something, these people look ahead.
[02:00:07.832 --> 02:00:09.433]  And that's what that's all about.
[02:00:09.433 --> 02:00:11.794]  Alright, TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:00:11.794 --> 02:00:12.514]  Check it out, folks.
[02:00:12.514 --> 02:00:14.675]  Get a free trial subscription there.
[02:00:14.675 --> 02:00:17.016]  We'll talk to you again, I hope, for a full hour next week, Bob.
[02:00:17.896 --> 02:00:18.736]  Okay, bye-bye.
[02:00:18.736 --> 02:00:19.096]  Take care.
[02:00:19.096 --> 02:00:19.957]  There he goes.
[02:00:19.957 --> 02:00:23.498]  Now, I want to bring Ted up just for three minutes or so, as we've got our guests coming up.
[02:00:23.498 --> 02:00:26.559]  Ted, two weeks ago you offered gold when you bought it at $700.
[02:00:26.559 --> 02:00:28.260]  Fifty-something bucks above that right now.
[02:00:28.260 --> 02:00:29.740]  You can pass on that savings.
[02:00:29.740 --> 02:00:31.441]  You have two coins left.
[02:00:31.441 --> 02:00:35.983]  All the other coins are sold out, but you have sovereigns and francs at a new great deal.
[02:00:35.983 --> 02:00:38.744]  Briefly, and this is a great deal, folks.
[02:00:38.744 --> 02:00:41.645]  Again, it's a great hedge against inflation and insurance policy.
[02:00:42.205 --> 02:00:54.189]  And then separately, if you're doing it for speculation, for what could be giant profits, it's also smart to get into, but for me, gold is just an insurance policy, and regardless, it's a time to buy right now.
[02:00:54.189 --> 02:00:56.530]  Ted, tell folks about today's offer.
[02:00:56.530 --> 02:01:06.254]  Yeah, what I have right now, Alex, I've got the last group of a bunch of $10 gold pieces that I purchased, a combination of $10 Indians and $10 Liberties, what I picked up when it was around $700 an ounce.
[02:01:08.114 --> 02:01:11.376]  They are the pre-1933 coins, the real U.S.
[02:01:11.376 --> 02:01:14.017]  coins that were made here, used as currency.
[02:01:14.017 --> 02:01:20.500]  Currently that coin is a $10 Indian, they're at $6.73, and the $10 Liberty is at $6.53.
[02:01:20.500 --> 02:01:23.982]  Obviously the Franks and the British Sovereigns are really good buy.
[02:01:23.982 --> 02:01:28.744]  You have to get into smaller gold pieces, and you can't do it better than this.
[02:01:28.744 --> 02:01:29.224]  Not with U.S.
[02:01:29.224 --> 02:01:29.465]  Eagle
[02:01:30.365 --> 02:01:35.450]  And to explain, most places don't even have gold or silver or there's 30, 40, 50 percent premiums.
[02:01:35.450 --> 02:01:41.716]  There's no premium on this because most of these coins that he's offering he had before it went up.
[02:01:41.716 --> 02:01:43.698]  That's exactly what's going on Alex right now.
[02:01:43.698 --> 02:01:47.121]  The physical supply on gold is just absolutely scarce.
[02:01:47.121 --> 02:01:49.384]  It's so hard to find coins to buy right now.
[02:01:49.964 --> 02:01:57.306]  And everybody, even all my customers call me and let me know how tough it is out there to try to buy even from my competitors.
[02:01:57.306 --> 02:02:01.147]  But yeah, right now, I'm walking Liberty Haves, they're a good buy at $8.40.
[02:02:01.147 --> 02:02:06.028]  Again, everything in the precious metals market has such turmoil.
[02:02:06.028 --> 02:02:08.969]  I mean, like when you see what Citigroup here just did.
[02:02:08.969 --> 02:02:16.271]  The article they published here just the other day talking about gold being at $3,000 an ounce, and they're like one of the Federal Reserve Bank branches.
[02:02:16.491 --> 02:02:20.972]  That was a secret memo that was covered by the BBC, London Telegraph and the Wall Street Journal.
[02:02:20.972 --> 02:02:22.993]  They're saying 3,000 by next year.
[02:02:22.993 --> 02:02:24.293]  We're not saying that.
[02:02:24.293 --> 02:02:25.774]  Those are internal memos.
[02:02:25.774 --> 02:02:28.915]  The point is, is that gold has intrinsic value.
[02:02:28.915 --> 02:02:29.715]  This is a great deal.
[02:02:29.715 --> 02:02:29.775]  800-686-2237.
[02:02:29.775 --> 02:02:31.936]  The brokers will be there till midnight tonight.
[02:02:35.777 --> 02:02:40.199]  They also have half-dollar silver at a great deal right now.
[02:02:40.199 --> 02:02:43.020]  800-686-2237.
[02:02:43.020 --> 02:02:45.421]  800-686-2237.
[02:02:45.421 --> 02:02:46.702]  How much is the silver, Ted?
[02:02:46.702 --> 02:02:49.403]  The silver is $8.60, and it's really a good buy, too, Alex.
[02:02:49.403 --> 02:02:54.085]  People need to have silver in their hands right now with the economic events that are coming.
[02:02:54.085 --> 02:02:54.966]  Are you kidding me?
[02:02:54.966 --> 02:02:57.527]  Folks, get into this before everybody else does.
[02:02:57.527 --> 02:02:58.527]  There's already huge shortages.
[02:02:58.527 --> 02:02:58.628]  800-686-2237.
[02:02:58.628 --> 02:03:00.468]  Tell them it's the radio special.
[02:03:00.468 --> 02:03:01.129]  Thank you, Ted.
[02:03:04.390 --> 02:03:05.231]  Thanks for having me out.
[02:03:05.231 --> 02:03:05.651]  You bet.
[02:03:05.651 --> 02:03:08.313]  Stay with us.
[02:03:08.313 --> 02:03:09.994]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:03:09.994 --> 02:03:14.738]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:03:14.738 --> 02:03:17.700]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:03:17.700 --> 02:03:20.762]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:03:20.762 --> 02:03:25.486]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[02:03:25.686 --> 02:03:26.887]  If you simply prepare.
[02:03:26.887 --> 02:03:30.610]  Our elected representatives wanted a good ol' boy bailout for the special interest.
[02:03:30.610 --> 02:03:32.671]  So they ignored your screams not to do it.
[02:03:32.671 --> 02:03:34.513]  They turned off the telephones and email.
[02:03:34.513 --> 02:03:38.476]  They voted to print 850 billion dollars at least out of thin air.
[02:03:38.476 --> 02:03:41.298]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[02:03:41.298 --> 02:03:47.502]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities.
[02:03:47.502 --> 02:03:50.445]  Particularly food, beyond many Americans reach.
[02:03:50.445 --> 02:03:54.948]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days.
[02:03:55.168 --> 02:03:57.509]  Until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[02:03:57.509 --> 02:04:01.972]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast, there seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[02:04:01.972 --> 02:04:07.655]  The private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[02:04:07.655 --> 02:04:10.896]  The stores have less food, but jack up prices to stay in business.
[02:04:10.896 --> 02:04:14.038]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[02:04:14.258 --> 02:04:16.079]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[02:04:16.079 --> 02:04:20.140]  One-third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[02:04:20.140 --> 02:04:24.281]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food.
[02:04:24.281 --> 02:04:31.803]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the new old order, has a lot less control over you.
[02:04:31.803 --> 02:04:35.744]  And so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[02:04:35.744 --> 02:04:38.605]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:04:38.965 --> 02:04:45.968]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:04:45.968 --> 02:04:49.250]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[02:04:49.250 --> 02:04:50.170]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:04:50.170 --> 02:04:54.392]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:04:54.392 --> 02:05:00.415]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[02:05:00.635 --> 02:05:04.438]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[02:05:04.438 --> 02:05:05.740]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:05:05.740 --> 02:05:06.400]  Take action today.
[02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:08.222]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:05:20.586 --> 02:05:25.427]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:05:25.427 --> 02:05:27.008]  You want answers?
[02:05:27.008 --> 02:05:27.928]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:27.928 --> 02:05:32.750]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:32.750 --> 02:05:36.811]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:05:37.611 --> 02:05:43.240]  For the rest of this hour and the entirety of the next, we have two great guests on with us.
[02:05:43.240 --> 02:05:51.913]  We're going to open the phones up at the end of the show, the last 30 minutes or so, for our guests joining us from Central America, down in Panama.
[02:05:52.714 --> 02:05:55.597]  We're the founders of Natural Solutions Foundation.
[02:05:55.597 --> 02:06:02.784]  I tried to go over both their bios, it would take all day, but Major General Albert N. Stubblebine, U.S.
[02:06:02.784 --> 02:06:06.148]  Army retired, and of course he headed up the U.S.
[02:06:06.148 --> 02:06:09.011]  Army's Electronic Research and Development Command, U.S.
[02:06:09.011 --> 02:06:14.376]  Army's Intelligence and Security Command, he was the head of Army Special Forces, the head of Fort Bragg,
[02:06:15.257 --> 02:06:20.780]  He's worked with some of the biggest and some of the most secretive defense contractors.
[02:06:20.780 --> 02:06:24.982]  He's been involved in some of the most secretive black-off operations.
[02:06:24.982 --> 02:06:29.083]  And after all these years of research, he's come to basically the same conclusion I have.
[02:06:29.083 --> 02:06:32.025]  This is a giant world government set up to carry out eugenics.
[02:06:32.605 --> 02:06:32.765]  I think?
[02:06:48.439 --> 02:06:49.839]  We're good.
[02:07:13.286 --> 02:07:21.034]  Really single-handedly with the help of the folks that are members of their organization, helped shoot down a lot of takeovers by Codex Alimentarius.
[02:07:21.034 --> 02:07:30.544]  They've been some of the sole reporters who at gunpoint have been pushed out of meetings, public supposed meetings that they've been guest of at the UN.
[02:07:30.544 --> 02:07:32.646]  Just amazing stories, so I wanted to have them
[02:07:33.607 --> 02:07:52.405]  On with us, Major General Stubblemine and the Medical Director of HealthFreedomUSA.org, and that is Rima E. Labo, MD, a graduate of Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and then it goes through all of her amazing research and all the great findings that she has made.
[02:07:52.665 --> 02:07:53.506]  Well, and it's great to be here!
[02:08:11.801 --> 02:08:13.282]  A lot is happening.
[02:08:13.282 --> 02:08:19.287]  Just a side issue before we get into the Codex Alimentarius, what you saw in Europe, and bring the doctor in.
[02:08:19.287 --> 02:08:22.970]  Have you heard all the big announcements that they're going to abolish the National Guard?
[02:08:22.970 --> 02:08:25.752]  I have all the documents here, but it's in the Washington Post.
[02:08:25.752 --> 02:08:28.795]  And put them under NORTHCOM, and it says for civil insurrection
[02:08:29.415 --> 02:08:30.996]  It's absolutely not constitutional.
[02:08:30.996 --> 02:08:32.737]  And it bothers the hell out of me, if you really want to know.
[02:08:59.095 --> 02:09:03.838]  I think it is horrible.
[02:09:03.838 --> 02:09:06.419]  You know, we have a Constitution.
[02:09:06.419 --> 02:09:10.942]  And what we've done with it is burn it, throw it away, and forget about it.
[02:09:10.942 --> 02:09:11.843]  And it's wrong.
[02:09:11.843 --> 02:09:14.285]  It'd be a revolt.
[02:09:28.874 --> 02:09:31.717]  They would say, you can't do that.
[02:09:31.717 --> 02:09:33.959]  It's not constitutional.
[02:09:33.959 --> 02:09:47.592]  You cannot use the military, the army, or the navy, or the marines, or the air force, for civil, for civil actions.
[02:09:47.592 --> 02:09:50.615]  It is not constitutional.
[02:09:50.615 --> 02:09:52.817]  And that's exactly what we would have said then.
[02:09:54.275 --> 02:09:57.477]  Why isn't it constitutional?
[02:09:57.477 --> 02:09:59.698]  Why is it not constitutional?
[02:09:59.698 --> 02:10:05.760]  Why did the founders, why did every other civilized nation say you don't have your army engaging the people?
[02:10:05.760 --> 02:10:09.702]  Because the army is meant to kill people and break things and go after enemies.
[02:10:09.702 --> 02:10:17.786]  I mean, why did the Romans 2,000 years ago say it's against the law for Caesar to bring the troops into Rome?
[02:10:17.786 --> 02:10:22.508]  Because you didn't want somebody who could become then a dictator
[02:10:23.562 --> 02:10:45.530]  And by using the army to quell any kind of unrest, any kind of disagreement, you didn't want this so-called ruler to take advantage of the power of the army, literally, to quell the populace.
[02:10:45.530 --> 02:10:52.032]  That's the reason that they passed the, they made it unconstitutional, because they knew,
[02:10:53.311 --> 02:11:04.195]  That it was not going to be correct if a ruler could become a dictator by using the military.
[02:11:04.195 --> 02:11:06.515]  Very simple.
[02:11:06.515 --> 02:11:11.117]  And that's what the Army War College and the Naval War College and all of them said for hundreds of years.
[02:11:13.582 --> 02:11:20.103]  My dad's got a big book, The History of the Army, and right in there it has several chapters saying what you just said.
[02:11:20.103 --> 02:11:28.225]  So the Army has to know what they're being told to do now is treason against the Constitution.
[02:11:28.225 --> 02:11:42.388]  Well, it's very interesting because at some level, or some levels, we apparently have sort of morphed into this position we're in.
[02:11:44.377 --> 02:11:53.659]  Instead of, you know, we didn't just sort of jump into this thing one day and suddenly be there.
[02:11:53.659 --> 02:11:57.580]  We've kind of oozed or morphed into this thing.
[02:11:57.580 --> 02:12:09.303]  I don't know what the current commanders are thinking, but I cannot help but believe that they are very, very upset with some of the things that are going on.
[02:12:09.303 --> 02:12:10.683]  I mean, you know, they brought this
[02:12:11.747 --> 02:12:36.177]  A unit out of Iraq, they attached it to NORTHCOM, they said, oh, by the way, your primary mission is going to be to quell riots, to move people into detaining facilities, into what are going to be concentration camps.
[02:12:40.543 --> 02:12:49.369]  I cannot believe that a commander who's being given that order doesn't say, what the hell is going on here?
[02:12:49.369 --> 02:12:51.570]  That's right.
[02:12:51.570 --> 02:12:53.191]  I was going to say, all of the National Guard.
[02:13:01.283 --> 02:13:08.146]  Yeah, and then I read deeper and it talks about Obama's civilian corps of one million.
[02:13:08.146 --> 02:13:09.367]  Does that concern you, sir?
[02:13:09.367 --> 02:13:14.389]  A one million man spy corps?
[02:13:14.389 --> 02:13:17.650]  Or is that going to be a personal army?
[02:13:17.650 --> 02:13:19.471]  Oh no, it's going to be outside the army, you're right.
[02:13:19.471 --> 02:13:24.233]  Yes, they're saying it's going to be a federal domestic force.
[02:13:24.233 --> 02:13:30.016]  I mean, how do people not recognize that that is... I mean, that is classic tyranny, is it not, sir?
[02:13:31.570 --> 02:13:35.933]  Okay, how can you have your own army?
[02:13:35.933 --> 02:13:37.994]  I mean, look at Blackwater.
[02:13:37.994 --> 02:13:38.674]  You know?
[02:13:38.674 --> 02:13:39.995]  What is Blackwater?
[02:13:39.995 --> 02:13:44.538]  Whose allegiance does Blackwater swear to?
[02:13:44.538 --> 02:13:47.039]  To the Constitution?
[02:13:47.039 --> 02:13:49.481]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[02:13:49.481 --> 02:13:53.023]  Does it swear to Halliburton?
[02:13:53.023 --> 02:13:54.844]  Well, I think so.
[02:13:54.844 --> 02:14:00.087]  So, how do you then have your own personal army and
[02:14:01.161 --> 02:14:05.762]  Then is there more than one personal army out there?
[02:14:05.762 --> 02:14:14.124]  You know, Halliburton got one, Obama had one, Miss McCain had one.
[02:14:14.124 --> 02:14:17.925]  Who else has their own personal army?
[02:14:17.925 --> 02:14:19.205]  And why?
[02:14:19.205 --> 02:14:23.947]  You know, the big question is not do they do, but why do they have it?
[02:14:23.947 --> 02:14:25.047]  Well, what's coming
[02:14:25.763 --> 02:14:34.546]  Alex, what's coming that we don't know that each one of these individuals needs their own army?
[02:14:34.546 --> 02:14:40.428]  What is that in your educated opinion, General?
[02:14:40.428 --> 02:14:53.933]  I think something is getting ready to happen, which is devastating, and I don't know whether it's another false flag event like 9-11, I don't know whether it's
[02:14:56.738 --> 02:15:02.081]  A, uh, avian flu pandemic.
[02:15:02.081 --> 02:15:02.782]  I don't know.
[02:15:02.782 --> 02:15:07.585]  I don't know the exact details.
[02:15:07.585 --> 02:15:09.226]  What is coming?
[02:15:09.226 --> 02:15:11.867]  You can bet your bottom dollar.
[02:15:11.867 --> 02:15:20.353]  People in the power structure know that they need an army, their private army.
[02:15:20.353 --> 02:15:25.676]  The people in the power structure know that they need train the
[02:15:30.989 --> 02:15:47.514]  And you're saying you believe, they've been setting this up quietly for decades as you know, it seems it's all coming to a head.
[02:15:47.514 --> 02:15:52.855]  Are you saying, General, the evidence is showing it's going to be initiated, it's going to be staged?
[02:15:57.045 --> 02:16:02.047]  So, it's very interesting because let me tell you how the intelligence works.
[02:16:02.047 --> 02:16:08.689]  First of all, any single piece of information is nothing more than a dot.
[02:16:08.689 --> 02:16:10.089]  That's all it is.
[02:16:10.089 --> 02:16:14.130]  It is an unverified piece of information.
[02:16:14.130 --> 02:16:18.171]  Then you get another unverified piece of information.
[02:16:18.171 --> 02:16:21.292]  And a third unverified piece of information.
[02:16:21.292 --> 02:16:22.993]  So I now have three dots.
[02:16:22.993 --> 02:16:24.093]  And four dots.
[02:16:24.093 --> 02:16:26.654]  Then when I get to a hundred dots, suddenly,
[02:16:27.659 --> 02:16:28.259]  We're good to go.
[02:16:52.628 --> 02:16:58.612]  It's like a 3D crossword or a 3D picture puzzle.
[02:16:58.612 --> 02:16:59.092]  Exactly!
[02:16:59.092 --> 02:17:00.753]  That's how... Oh, amazing, General.
[02:17:00.753 --> 02:17:01.073]  Stay there.
[02:17:01.073 --> 02:17:05.676]  We're going to break and come back and then shift into the health attack, what's happening, how we counter it.
[02:17:05.676 --> 02:17:08.597]  But that's exactly how I described it myself earlier this week.
[02:17:08.597 --> 02:17:12.800]  I'll study things for years and then finally it's like all the pieces come together.
[02:17:12.800 --> 02:17:14.901]  It's exactly what you're saying.
[02:17:14.901 --> 02:17:17.523]  I want to skip this break.
[02:17:17.523 --> 02:17:20.204]  I want to skip this break, John.
[02:17:20.204 --> 02:17:21.145]  General Stubblebine.
[02:17:23.479 --> 02:17:25.319]  General Stubblebine.
[02:17:25.319 --> 02:17:26.760]  He should be there.
[02:17:26.760 --> 02:17:29.360]  I think he's handing the phone to Dr. Labo.
[02:17:29.360 --> 02:17:31.140]  Dr. Labo?
[02:17:31.140 --> 02:17:32.141]  Yeah, I'm here too.
[02:17:32.141 --> 02:17:34.421]  Are you guys sharing the telephone again down there in Panama?
[02:17:34.421 --> 02:17:36.321]  No, we have separate phones.
[02:17:36.321 --> 02:17:37.822]  Okay, fantastic.
[02:17:37.822 --> 02:17:39.742]  Listen, listen, we're on the internet live right now.
[02:17:39.742 --> 02:17:43.483]  We're going to be back on the main AM and FM when we come back.
[02:17:43.483 --> 02:17:45.963]  What do you guys both want to get into first?
[02:17:45.963 --> 02:17:47.503]  What Codex Alimentarius is?
[02:17:50.584 --> 02:18:01.630]  Recap of how you've been fighting it, what the latest meeting revealed, and then go through the catalog of things they're doing to us, and then how to counter it, and then how folks can go join your organization.
[02:18:02.887 --> 02:18:04.068]  Get on your free mailing list.
[02:18:04.068 --> 02:18:22.561]  We also want to have time, Alex, to talk about reclaiming the production of food and taking back your health by taking back your food, becoming an intensive farmer in your apartment or whatever, and we want to talk about the Panama Project.
[02:18:22.561 --> 02:18:24.563]  Let me just briefly ask the General a question.
[02:18:24.563 --> 02:18:31.528]  General, were you done with the statement about the dots, or do you want to briefly, when we come back, finish that and then get into all the other topics, or are you done?
[02:18:32.289 --> 02:18:40.563]  All I want to do is just like you did, suddenly a picture emerges and you say, oh, truth dawns then.
[02:18:40.563 --> 02:18:42.065]  And now what do you do with it?
[02:18:42.065 --> 02:18:45.371]  You're stuck with this picture and you now have to
[02:18:46.641 --> 02:18:51.904]  You know, take the countermeasures against that.
[02:18:51.904 --> 02:18:54.765]  I mean, you call it dots, now they're just announcing it.
[02:18:54.765 --> 02:18:57.507]  I mean, they say this is for the American people.
[02:18:57.507 --> 02:18:59.288]  They say they're going to use the army on us.
[02:18:59.288 --> 02:19:01.489]  They say torture's good.
[02:19:01.489 --> 02:19:04.951]  And it's psychological warfare.
[02:19:04.951 --> 02:19:10.894]  I mean, you're an expert in this, but perhaps you can speak to this when we come back, too, and then we're going to do a big turn with Dr. Labo.
[02:19:10.894 --> 02:19:11.735]  We appreciate her being here.
[02:19:12.575 --> 02:19:20.624]  Is that it seems they're throwing it in our face to kind of just shock us into acclamation when they go, we always said mercury was bad, now it's good for kids.
[02:19:20.624 --> 02:19:24.328]  We always said melamine was bad, now we say it's good for kids.
[02:19:24.328 --> 02:19:27.231]  You know, we always said that poison was bad, now it's good.
[02:19:27.231 --> 02:19:33.418]  I mean, it's like they're wanting to reveal... This was predicted and this was
[02:19:34.578 --> 02:19:36.759]  delineated by George Orwell.
[02:19:36.759 --> 02:19:39.140]  We know how this works.
[02:19:39.140 --> 02:19:44.242]  He was a prescient genius who told us, they're following the Orwellian script.
[02:19:44.242 --> 02:19:46.723]  They do it just as he said they would do it.
[02:19:46.723 --> 02:19:56.767]  They twist meaning, they change reality, and if we're not alert and holding on to our reality, we become their pawn.
[02:19:56.767 --> 02:19:58.408]  Absolutely.
[02:19:58.408 --> 02:19:59.888]  One point, we're going live in one minute.
[02:20:01.926 --> 02:20:06.168]  General Stubblebine's phone is a bit low, yours is a bit hot.
[02:20:06.168 --> 02:20:10.689]  And I know you're in another country, so I'm surprised by the quality we've got.
[02:20:10.689 --> 02:20:16.912]  General Stubblebine, just speak up a little bit, sir, and then Dr. Labo, you might want to back off a bit.
[02:20:16.912 --> 02:20:23.194]  But again, you guys are the best, and I will plug each hour how folks get on your free mailing list and all the great information you've got.
[02:20:23.194 --> 02:20:24.435]  Fabulous.
[02:20:24.435 --> 02:20:26.536]  Fabulous.
[02:20:26.536 --> 02:20:29.737]  You're the only person in the world that I'd ever agree to back off for.
[02:20:31.321 --> 02:20:32.162]  You are a little loud.
[02:20:32.162 --> 02:20:35.503]  I'm holding the phone further away.
[02:20:35.503 --> 02:20:36.604]  Does that help?
[02:20:52.745 --> 02:20:55.326]  And we'll come back and have the general finish and then go back to you.
[02:20:55.326 --> 02:20:56.947]  This is a short segment, a long one.
[02:20:56.947 --> 02:20:59.929]  We had an 18-minute segment coming up, so you won't be interrupted after this one.
[02:20:59.929 --> 02:21:00.669]  This is a short one.
[02:21:00.669 --> 02:21:01.189]  Here we go, guys.
[02:21:17.657 --> 02:21:28.960]  All right, let's go right back to our guest, General Stubblebine, finishing up the point about an intelligence, a dot here, a dot there, and then overall, you get the clear picture.
[02:21:28.960 --> 02:21:34.142]  Now that's not even dots, they're just throwing it in our face, admitting everything.
[02:21:34.142 --> 02:21:36.623]  Finish up that thought, sir.
[02:21:36.623 --> 02:21:46.706]  Well, look, the first thing that, when you have the dots, and, you know, it's nothing but a set of dots, and then suddenly, just suddenly, the entire picture just sort of
[02:21:47.370 --> 02:21:52.011]  is there in front of you, and you say, oh my god, I've had this information all along.
[02:21:52.011 --> 02:21:52.531]  Bingo!
[02:21:52.531 --> 02:21:53.491]  There it is.
[02:21:53.491 --> 02:21:54.832]  Now I know.
[02:21:54.832 --> 02:21:58.833]  The question then becomes, what do I do about it?
[02:21:58.833 --> 02:22:04.134]  When I know what the picture is, and I know it's horrific, what the heck do I do?
[02:22:04.134 --> 02:22:05.834]  Do I just accept it?
[02:22:05.834 --> 02:22:11.096]  Do I just sort of lay down and give up?
[02:22:11.096 --> 02:22:14.176]  Or do I begin to resist?
[02:22:14.176 --> 02:22:16.677]  Do I mount a resistance of some sort?
[02:22:17.290 --> 02:22:20.952]  What do I do with this picture now that I know what it is?
[02:22:20.952 --> 02:22:32.678]  And what's happening, Alex, unfortunately, and you mentioned it, what's happening is they're now saying, oh yes, by the way, we are going to destroy the Constitution.
[02:22:32.678 --> 02:22:34.579]  We're not going to pay attention to the Constitution.
[02:22:34.579 --> 02:22:43.663]  And oh, by the way, we are going to deploy army troops to quell any kind of resistance that you might put up.
[02:22:44.136 --> 02:22:50.299]  And if you resist, you probably are going to go into a detainment camp somewhere.
[02:22:50.299 --> 02:22:59.283]  Well, now that they're pronouncing it, now that they're saying it, again, what does the populace do?
[02:22:59.283 --> 02:23:01.024]  I'll tell you what most of it is doing.
[02:23:01.024 --> 02:23:05.446]  It's saying, whoa, back off, back off, back off.
[02:23:05.446 --> 02:23:07.267]  I think I will be quiet.
[02:23:07.267 --> 02:23:09.968]  I think I will just shut up and pay attention.
[02:23:16.148 --> 02:23:37.033]  So you're saying they're openly announcing it to cause a chilling effect, and A, that's one question, and then B, I'm going to throw this in, they threaten Congress, as you know, or if you don't, we'll play the clip, Senator Inhofe admits it, others, with martial law they wouldn't pass the banker takeover, so this is the illegitimate government menacing the real government.
[02:23:37.033 --> 02:23:37.353]  Go ahead.
[02:23:38.973 --> 02:23:46.216]  That's exactly what's happening, and oh, by the way, what is happening with all of these announcements?
[02:23:46.216 --> 02:23:49.858]  The introduction of fear.
[02:23:49.858 --> 02:23:52.319]  Fear subdues.
[02:23:52.319 --> 02:24:01.562]  And let me tell you, that's exactly where they're headed, because they're going to make it fearful for anybody to do anything in the way of resistance.
[02:24:01.562 --> 02:24:02.283]  Period.
[02:24:02.283 --> 02:24:04.564]  Well, is something wrong with me, then, or you?
[02:24:04.564 --> 02:24:07.225]  All this does is make me angry in one amount of resistance.
[02:24:08.527 --> 02:24:09.988]  Well, may I jump in?
[02:24:09.988 --> 02:24:11.809]  Yes, go ahead, Doctor.
[02:24:11.809 --> 02:24:23.516]  I think what's happening is that you and General Bublebein and I and the other patriots and freedom folks have not brushed their teeth with enough fluoride.
[02:24:23.516 --> 02:24:37.605]  Fluoride, as I'm sure your listeners know, Alex, and as I know you know, was used initially in the Soviet gulag to make the political prisoners easy to deal with.
[02:24:38.103 --> 02:24:38.564]  Thank you.
[02:24:54.725 --> 02:24:58.007]  Hold on, we've got an hour and a half coming up so we can get into that.
[02:24:58.007 --> 02:25:03.589]  By the way, two years ago the American Medical Association said kids under six, don't give it to them, it's bad for your teeth.
[02:25:03.589 --> 02:25:13.634]  So, for those that don't believe us, they admit it's not good for your teeth, it causes dental firosis, but you're a medical doctor, so certainly you can speak to that.
[02:25:13.634 --> 02:25:14.574]  Absolutely.
[02:25:14.574 --> 02:25:18.076]  But the point is that we have been poisoned, we have been
[02:25:19.249 --> 02:25:36.135]  Subdued psychologically through the media, we have been rendered fearful and we have been rendered apathetic by the toxins in our diet, by the microwaves, and by the toxic information, or quote information, that we've taken in.
[02:25:36.135 --> 02:25:37.915]  It's having its effect.
[02:25:37.915 --> 02:25:46.258]  This is a full spectrum cocktail, and then you find out they knew decades before and they deploy these as weapon systems against us, General.
[02:25:48.564 --> 02:25:51.405]  Absolutely, and guess what?
[02:25:51.405 --> 02:25:56.527]  The food that is being degraded is being used as a weapon.
[02:25:56.527 --> 02:26:15.995]  I mean, you know, it's not being touted right now as weaponized food, but that's exactly where they're going, and that's exactly what's happening, and so every bit of, bite of food that you take in, if you allow them the privilege of eating the food that they would like you to eat,
[02:26:16.618 --> 02:26:16.939]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:26:29.975 --> 02:26:34.798]  And not impacted very well, from a health perspective.
[02:26:34.798 --> 02:26:37.620]  And so the food is being weaponized.
[02:26:52.088 --> 02:26:54.910]  And it's in the Royal Commission on Population, put out by the British they are.
[02:26:54.910 --> 02:26:57.513]  So what the General and the Doctor are saying is the truth.
[02:26:57.513 --> 02:27:02.357]  Amazing interview with General Stubblebine and Dr. Labo and their website.
[02:27:02.357 --> 02:27:06.520]  We've got that up on screen at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:27:06.520 --> 02:27:07.902]  We're on the march.
[02:27:07.902 --> 02:27:10.444]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:10.444 --> 02:27:14.547]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:14.547 --> 02:27:16.489]  John, let them know we're going to be back in three minutes.
[02:27:16.489 --> 02:27:17.410]  Did you know that it's a documentary?
[02:27:17.410 --> 02:27:17.750]  You got it.
[02:27:19.116 --> 02:27:25.359]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[02:27:25.359 --> 02:27:33.542]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[02:27:33.542 --> 02:27:38.124]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[02:27:38.124 --> 02:27:40.885]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[02:27:40.885 --> 02:27:47.628]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning, and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized
[02:27:47.988 --> 02:27:48.509]  I think so.
[02:28:16.164 --> 02:28:18.305]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[02:28:18.305 --> 02:28:20.767]  I've come with a message of information.
[02:28:20.767 --> 02:28:23.369]  9-11 was an inside job.
[02:28:23.369 --> 02:28:24.569]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[02:28:24.569 --> 02:28:26.290]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[02:28:26.290 --> 02:28:29.172]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[02:28:29.172 --> 02:28:32.814]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[02:28:42.464 --> 02:28:47.329]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[02:28:47.329 --> 02:28:48.410]  An inside job.
[02:28:51.116 --> 02:28:52.376]  How dare you?
[02:28:52.376 --> 02:28:58.638]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[02:28:58.638 --> 02:29:01.279]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[02:29:01.279 --> 02:29:07.740]  And if the government has not told the truth, in 5 years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9- Truth Rising.
[02:29:07.740 --> 02:29:10.821]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[02:29:10.821 --> 02:29:13.101]  Or get the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:29:13.101 --> 02:29:15.562]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[02:29:17.074 --> 02:29:21.216]  You don't have to be in the military to enjoy military surplus savings.
[02:29:21.216 --> 02:29:27.380]  Right now at MainMilitary.com, you'll find savings on the top must-have military supplies.
[02:29:27.380 --> 02:29:29.021]  M10 gas masks for $12 or 3 for $30.
[02:29:29.021 --> 02:29:30.121]  Gas mask hoods, $4 or 3 for $10.
[02:29:33.303 --> 02:29:35.925]  Mask filters, six dollars or three for fifteen.
[02:29:35.925 --> 02:29:39.008]  Save big on British chemical suits, only twelve dollars.
[02:29:39.008 --> 02:29:41.110]  Israeli gas masks, twenty dollars.
[02:29:41.110 --> 02:29:44.754]  Trigger finger gloves, five dollars a pair or thirty six dollars a dozen.
[02:29:44.754 --> 02:29:48.077]  Snowshoe binding for eight dollars or forty eight dollars a dozen.
[02:29:48.077 --> 02:29:49.378]  And so much more.
[02:29:49.378 --> 02:29:52.761]  Even hard to find surplus items, all at surplus prices.
[02:29:53.081 --> 02:29:53.702]  We're good to go.
[02:30:37.130 --> 02:30:40.834]  The entire configuration being designed by the global government.
[02:30:40.834 --> 02:30:41.735]  Openly announced now.
[02:30:41.735 --> 02:30:43.257]  There's no more denial.
[02:30:43.257 --> 02:30:46.961]  Those of us who could see the dots years ago, decades ago, you laughed at us.
[02:30:46.961 --> 02:30:48.683]  Now, it's not even dots.
[02:30:48.683 --> 02:30:51.066]  They just took the mask right off.
[02:30:51.066 --> 02:30:53.889]  And they said, we're coming straight on for humanity.
[02:30:56.035 --> 02:30:56.995]  We don't have a choice.
[02:30:56.995 --> 02:30:58.616]  We have to fight back in any way we can.
[02:30:58.616 --> 02:31:07.240]  And I'm going to ask Major General Stubblebine and Dr. Labo, from their educated perspective, what we do in that fight.
[02:31:07.240 --> 02:31:11.181]  But let's continue, for those that don't know, with some of the worst things.
[02:31:11.181 --> 02:31:22.726]  Not just the melamine, but the plastics, with the estrogen mimicking, endocrine disruptors, what the GMO foods are doing, sterilizing, what's being sprayed, the fluoride, the mercury, the arsenic.
[02:31:23.306 --> 02:31:26.289]  Well, let's start with the fact that every bite we take
[02:31:48.991 --> 02:32:02.378]  Can either add to our health and our vitality or it can diminish our ability to protect ourselves through our immune system and through our regenerative capacity.
[02:32:02.378 --> 02:32:03.218]  I'm a physician.
[02:32:03.218 --> 02:32:06.840]  I have practiced drug-free medicine for the best part of 40 years.
[02:32:07.802 --> 02:32:12.624]  So I'm very, very aware of what nutrition does.
[02:32:12.624 --> 02:32:17.946]  And you've treated, and you've treated to interrupt royalty and heads of state.
[02:32:17.946 --> 02:32:19.227]  But let me see your top position.
[02:32:19.227 --> 02:32:21.368]  Go ahead.
[02:32:21.368 --> 02:32:35.694]  And the reason that royalty, heads of state, people from all over the world came to see us in our practice was that when everything else that conventional medicine has to offer has failed,
[02:32:36.192 --> 02:32:51.043]  People seek the sensible alternatives, and I am, by the way, a physician who believes that the only place that pharmaceuticals have a reason to exist in medicine is in the emergency room.
[02:32:51.043 --> 02:33:05.053]  Beyond that, virtually everything that a pharmaceutical does, dangerously, expensively, and with tremendous side effects, everything can be done by natural methods, by frequency medicine, by nutrition.
[02:33:05.632 --> 02:33:18.419]  By energy medicine and the reason I can say that so confidently is that throughout my entire career I have treated the most difficult patients that anybody can have in their practice.
[02:33:18.419 --> 02:33:28.444]  People who were dying or unable to tolerate meds and in terrible trouble and they came to me and by and large they got well.
[02:33:28.444 --> 02:33:33.987]  Not just symptom free which is all that allopathic medicine has to offer if it
[02:33:34.828 --> 02:33:48.293]  If it does that well, and usually it doesn't, but truly, radiantly, and in many cases, transcendently well, through giving the body, the heart, the mind, the spirit, what it needs to heal.
[02:33:48.293 --> 02:33:51.694]  What it does not need is toxins.
[02:33:51.694 --> 02:34:01.657]  If you are eating conventional American food, what we call the Standard American Diet, or SAD, you are already eating weaponized food.
[02:34:02.208 --> 02:34:17.479]  I just published an article in one of our blog spots, which you can get to by going to our main website, healthfreedomusa.org, and then clicking on the second button on the left, which takes you to the Health Freedom blog.
[02:34:17.479 --> 02:34:31.510]  I just published an article today on the fact that the food supply already contains food grown from seeds which have been irradiated not to prevent
[02:34:32.363 --> 02:34:33.184]  I think?
[02:34:48.095 --> 02:34:48.295]  Yeah.
[02:35:04.154 --> 02:35:07.257]  And I don't know what is.
[02:35:07.257 --> 02:35:08.058]  And they're open air.
[02:35:08.058 --> 02:35:09.199]  Can you speak to this?
[02:35:09.199 --> 02:35:11.861]  And then the General wants to come and pop in.
[02:35:11.861 --> 02:35:26.614]  They are open air planting thousands of varieties of x-rayed and gamma-rayed and cross-species plant varieties which are cousins to all these other plants and it's openly jumping in to all the other crops.
[02:35:26.614 --> 02:35:27.775]  That's on record.
[02:35:27.775 --> 02:35:28.775]  Absolutely.
[02:35:28.775 --> 02:35:29.476]  Absolutely.
[02:35:29.476 --> 02:35:30.597]  And they are also
[02:35:31.138 --> 02:35:41.822]  Openly, the United States Department of Agriculture is in the process, in these last lame-duck disastrous days of deregulating everything in the world that the U.S.
[02:35:41.822 --> 02:35:55.166]  government can, is in the process of essentially eliminating any controls or regulations on the outdoor growth and therefore the genetic mixing of genetically modified plants.
[02:35:55.166 --> 02:35:55.406]  Dear God!
[02:35:55.406 --> 02:35:55.826]  That means
[02:35:58.837 --> 02:36:21.950]  That, for instance, foods that are genetically altered to produce industrial chemicals or pharmaceuticals will be allowed to mix their DNA with everything else, not just other food crops of the same species, but food crops of other species and weeds, and they get into insects, and they get into animals that eat them that we eat.
[02:36:21.950 --> 02:36:25.772]  We're talking about food Armageddon.
[02:36:25.772 --> 02:36:25.952]  Now,
[02:36:26.587 --> 02:36:28.849]  That's not acceptable to me.
[02:36:28.849 --> 02:36:32.913]  We're talking about intentionally despoiling the Earth.
[02:36:32.913 --> 02:36:44.123]  And if anybody doubts that it's intentional, all they need to do is go to your data, Alex, or go to our data on our website, healthfreedomusa.org.
[02:36:44.123 --> 02:36:53.191]  We have something called the GMO files in our Health Freedom blog, and there's an abundance of truly horrifying independent science.
[02:36:53.632 --> 02:36:55.633]  This is designed to kill.
[02:36:55.633 --> 02:36:57.113]  This is designed to maim.
[02:36:57.113 --> 02:36:59.954]  This is designed to weaken the immune system.
[02:36:59.954 --> 02:37:03.355]  And this is designed to cause infertility.
[02:37:03.355 --> 02:37:07.957]  Now, if that's what you want for yourself, then that's fine.
[02:37:07.957 --> 02:37:08.677]  Do nothing.
[02:37:08.677 --> 02:37:10.898]  Continue to eat processed food.
[02:37:10.898 --> 02:37:16.840]  Continue to be a person with a slave mentality and be amused
[02:37:19.405 --> 02:37:43.322]  Just to add a question to both of you, I've had Nobel Prize winning geneticists, I've had top scientists, I mean these are people who are running multi-billion dollar companies, and they'll talk about how if you change one gene in a rat, or one gene in a tomato, or one gene in a pig, it randomly, you get the change you want, but it randomly changes thousands of other things, and they admit
[02:37:44.002 --> 02:37:52.914]  That the German studies killing the honeybees with just one form of GMO corn that has a pesticide grown naturally in it so other bugs won't eat it but the honeybees will.
[02:37:52.914 --> 02:38:00.525]  Then they feed us those pesticides that are secreted in the corn naturally as you know but for audience listening you know they talk about
[02:38:00.985 --> 02:38:02.527]  I wouldn't call it Armageddon.
[02:38:02.527 --> 02:38:04.388]  I would say that there's a war.
[02:38:28.621 --> 02:38:31.924]  I mean, this is a war that we're in.
[02:38:31.924 --> 02:38:36.747]  And as a war, you must take action.
[02:38:36.747 --> 02:38:37.868]  You cannot.
[02:38:37.868 --> 02:38:44.253]  You cannot sit back and not do anything unless you want to be a slave.
[02:38:44.253 --> 02:38:44.994]  Or dead.
[02:38:44.994 --> 02:38:47.796]  Yeah, well, they're not even wanting to enslave us!
[02:38:47.796 --> 02:38:49.137]  To choose.
[02:38:49.137 --> 02:38:50.197]  Slave or dead.
[02:38:50.197 --> 02:38:56.843]  Well, I think that in previous wars, the idea was to capture the population and
[02:38:57.968 --> 02:38:59.949]  Use it for your own purposes.
[02:38:59.949 --> 02:39:01.889]  This war... But they were called slaves.
[02:39:01.889 --> 02:39:02.850]  They were called serfs.
[02:39:02.850 --> 02:39:03.130]  You're right.
[02:39:03.130 --> 02:39:03.830]  They were called serfs.
[02:39:03.830 --> 02:39:04.930]  They were called serfs.
[02:39:04.930 --> 02:39:06.091]  This is genocide, though.
[02:39:06.091 --> 02:39:08.311]  This war is a genocidal war.
[02:39:08.311 --> 02:39:17.194]  There will be a few serfs, but with mechanized labor-saving devices, with machines, with cyborgs.
[02:39:17.194 --> 02:39:19.375]  We don't need very many serfs.
[02:39:19.375 --> 02:39:26.597]  What they are going to want to do, and we were told this by a head of state whom we were treating in our practice.
[02:39:26.597 --> 02:39:27.377]  I mentioned this on
[02:39:27.904 --> 02:39:30.226]  The radio a couple of days ago with you, Alex.
[02:39:30.226 --> 02:39:51.442]  This woman is a head of state and she said that she had been raised to believe that the useless peers of the earth, that's us, our children, our friends, our family, our loved ones, were consuming their, that's the master classes, non-renewable resources.
[02:39:51.442 --> 02:39:55.025]  And I said, and therefore they had to be eliminated and the time was coming
[02:39:55.427 --> 02:39:57.487]  When that would finally be accomplished.
[02:39:57.487 --> 02:40:00.328]  This was in 2002.
[02:40:00.328 --> 02:40:08.190]  I believe that we are now at that next phase and the tools have been put in place.
[02:40:08.190 --> 02:40:24.533]  The fear is being marshaled, managed and very much manipulated to quell the populace and the genocidal weaponization of food, of vaccines, of
[02:40:25.169 --> 02:40:36.437]  Medicine has all been put in place to enact this final cleansing so that we do not use up their non-renewable resources.
[02:40:36.437 --> 02:40:38.079]  Let me stop you there.
[02:40:38.079 --> 02:40:50.067]  Then people say, well, they're destroying the Earth's biosphere in the name of saving it, but they say, what you read earlier is what the head of Sun Microsystems and others have said, the elite plan to kill the majority of us and then have a small group
[02:40:50.888 --> 02:41:19.108]  With this whole technological system, this is the official UN plan, and I want the General to comment on it after you do, but my question here, that's why they're creating all the governmental seed banks, the ARCs, because they plan to release all these plagues, then, quote, manage it, claiming they're fighting it, use that as the pretext to basically exterminate the majority of us, and then they think they're going to put the genie back in the bottle, but the geneticists and the engineers I talked to, they say it probably can't be put back in, so at the final equation,
[02:41:20.088 --> 02:41:28.491]  They are completely insane, though they are intelligently insane, with kind of a dark logic or... General, what would you call that?
[02:41:28.491 --> 02:41:36.994]  I'd call it stupid.
[02:41:36.994 --> 02:41:37.934]  Very simple.
[02:41:37.934 --> 02:41:40.375]  You know, I'm a simple guy.
[02:41:40.375 --> 02:41:42.736]  I think that it's crazy.
[02:41:42.736 --> 02:41:46.698]  I mean, you know, food as a weapon is not new.
[02:41:48.605 --> 02:41:56.787]  You know, did a scorched earth policy during the Civil War when he was down in Georgia.
[02:41:56.787 --> 02:42:01.488]  He was trying to kill everybody inside.
[02:42:01.488 --> 02:42:02.668]  He was killing the food.
[02:42:02.668 --> 02:42:04.109]  He was going to kill the people.
[02:42:04.109 --> 02:42:05.649]  I mean, that's what he did.
[02:42:05.649 --> 02:42:17.752]  So this is not new in terms of a way of waging war, except that this now, instead of just burning everything, this has
[02:42:18.601 --> 02:42:24.924]  Genetically modified ingredients which they don't even have a clue.
[02:42:25.683 --> 02:42:28.385]  Which way they're going to jump, which way they're going to go.
[02:42:28.385 --> 02:42:35.571]  We don't know, except that we do know it is not going to be good for what we, for our bellies.
[02:42:35.571 --> 02:42:44.818]  And they've done, and they've done, they've done tens of thousands of different ones, and some are going bad, some are going kind of sideways, none of it's good.
[02:42:44.818 --> 02:42:49.201]  And some are going to make people infertile so that there won't be any kids.
[02:42:49.201 --> 02:42:50.102]  Exactly.
[02:42:50.102 --> 02:42:53.745]  I hope all of your listeners, Alex, know about the Austrian study.
[02:42:54.218 --> 02:42:57.261]  That was, uh, released about ten days ago.
[02:42:57.261 --> 02:42:57.682]  Yeah, tell them.
[02:42:57.682 --> 02:42:59.864]  Which shows the two... Pardon me?
[02:42:59.864 --> 02:43:02.386]  Yeah, tell them about the mice.
[02:43:02.386 --> 02:43:16.481]  Uh, two types of corn, NK-603 and MON-810, are ubiquitously approved, even in Europe, for animal feed and for human, uh, consumption.
[02:43:16.481 --> 02:43:17.502]  Now, these corns
[02:43:18.381 --> 02:43:18.702]  I think?
[02:43:35.199 --> 02:43:43.866]  Think about when your parents, or when you, if you're older than 20 or 30, started to have children.
[02:43:43.866 --> 02:43:48.089]  You and your friends all became pregnant pretty much when you wanted to.
[02:43:48.089 --> 02:43:56.776]  Well, at this point, the numbers of infertile couples, the number of people who have to go for fertility treatment or never do manage to,
[02:43:57.056 --> 02:43:57.596]  Thank you.
[02:44:10.399 --> 02:44:14.401]  They really need to get their head out of the sand.
[02:44:14.401 --> 02:44:29.788]  Doctor, as you know, that's why the main guinea pig they use is mice and rats, because biologically they found that mice, rats, and pigs, with cross-spectrum drugs and tests, are the closest to our metabolic system.
[02:44:29.788 --> 02:44:37.691]  And so, conclusively, in a whole bunch of studies of sterilizing mammals that eat all sorts of GMO, and that's clearly being engineered into that,
[02:44:40.252 --> 02:44:51.163]  Now you've mentioned this head of state, and I know for confidentiality reasons you can't get into it, but specifically, flesh it out, was there anything else she said you haven't told us?
[02:44:51.163 --> 02:44:54.206]  Oh yes, she said a great deal that I haven't discussed.
[02:44:55.067 --> 02:45:06.718]  One of the things that she did was bring her children to me, these were grown children, to find out whether they had been conditioned through mind control techniques as she believed that she had been.
[02:45:06.718 --> 02:45:12.362]  Now remember, people say, well, she would know whether she was conditioned through mind control techniques.
[02:45:12.362 --> 02:45:20.850]  No, not at all, because people have their awareness compartmentalized through the horrific processes that are used
[02:45:21.377 --> 02:45:44.430]  And many of the things that we call satanical ritual abuse are in fact mind control programs that are disguised in a quasi-religion of satanism, which of course is no religion at all, but is really a political program designed to produce the desired effect in human behavior.
[02:45:44.430 --> 02:45:50.153]  Because after all, just as biology and life are not sacred to these people,
[02:45:50.660 --> 02:45:59.208]  So, behavior and the essence of humanity that many people call the soul is not sacred either.
[02:45:59.208 --> 02:46:04.332]  And people may say, my God, have they no limit to what they will invade and destroy?
[02:46:04.332 --> 02:46:05.994]  And the answer is no, they have no limit.
[02:46:06.254 --> 02:46:10.795]  I've studied the globalists for a long time, and what you're saying is their religion is betrayal.
[02:46:10.795 --> 02:46:15.896]  Their religion is defiling innocence and destroying beauty and hurting the order of things.
[02:46:15.896 --> 02:46:19.417]  They want to remake creation in their own image.
[02:46:19.417 --> 02:46:23.038]  General Stubblebine, I know it's all classified, you can't get into it, but you ran Special Forces.
[02:46:23.038 --> 02:46:33.880]  I know you know about it, a film with George Clooney coming out about you, but the point is, I know you can't get much into it, but you guys were into the whole mind power being studied in the Army.
[02:46:34.620 --> 02:46:35.621]  You headed that up.
[02:46:35.621 --> 02:46:48.291]  Did you guys in your research ever run into, back in that time, the dark stuff that Dr. Labo is talking about?
[02:46:48.291 --> 02:46:49.252]  She brought that up.
[02:46:49.252 --> 02:46:58.879]  One of the things that very interestingly came to me, I've got to go back into just a very quick bit of history.
[02:46:58.879 --> 02:47:03.123]  When I took over the Intelligence and Security Command, which was my final
[02:47:04.190 --> 02:47:07.431]  I think we're good to go.
[02:47:31.129 --> 02:47:44.216]  Go out and find all of the things that would allow a person to work better, not longer, so that we could still meet our requirements.
[02:47:44.216 --> 02:47:49.039]  Well, out of that came some very fascinating things.
[02:47:49.039 --> 02:47:59.185]  One of which, and this is in this stupid book about staring at goats, one of that items was a
[02:48:07.076 --> 02:48:08.719]  Stay there, stay there, General.
[02:48:08.719 --> 02:48:10.521]  We've got to talk about, we've got a break.
[02:48:10.521 --> 02:48:11.342]  We'll be back in three minutes.
[02:48:11.342 --> 02:48:13.806]  We'll finish up with this powerful information.
[02:48:13.806 --> 02:48:14.206]  Stay with us.
[02:48:16.138 --> 02:48:17.819]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[02:48:17.819 --> 02:48:19.559]  What does humidity mean to you?
[02:48:19.559 --> 02:48:22.240]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[02:48:22.240 --> 02:48:27.382]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[02:48:27.382 --> 02:48:30.563]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[02:49:15.200 --> 02:49:22.842]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:49:22.842 --> 02:49:24.503]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:49:25.661 --> 02:49:27.022]  Who is the enemy?
[02:49:27.022 --> 02:49:27.823]  Bin Laden.
[02:49:27.823 --> 02:49:28.864]  This is his ammo.
[02:49:28.864 --> 02:49:30.165]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:49:30.165 --> 02:49:32.186]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:49:32.186 --> 02:49:39.331]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:49:39.331 --> 02:49:39.832]  Some U.S.
[02:49:39.832 --> 02:49:45.456]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:49:46.156 --> 02:49:49.679]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:49:49.679 --> 02:50:00.148]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:50:00.148 --> 02:50:01.369]  Fabled enemies.

[02:51:20.225 --> 02:51:22.166]  Okay, General.
[02:51:22.166 --> 02:51:24.187]  You were tasked with studying all this.
[02:51:24.187 --> 02:51:26.088]  The Russians were studying it.
[02:51:26.088 --> 02:51:34.372]  So there at Fort Bragg and other places, you had gotten up to the point about some of the experiments with animals.
[02:51:34.372 --> 02:51:35.772]  Please continue, sir.
[02:51:35.772 --> 02:51:45.917]  What I was talking about was that I put together this high-performance task force to try to figure out how we could cope with the lack of resources and more requirements.
[02:51:47.748 --> 02:51:58.190]  Many, many different kinds of things appeared on my desk, one of which was this ability to use the mind to stare at an animal.
[02:51:58.190 --> 02:52:06.332]  It doesn't need to be a goat, but an animal, and with mental power explode the heart.
[02:52:06.332 --> 02:52:10.233]  Well, that was not my responsibility.
[02:52:10.233 --> 02:52:17.355]  My responsibility, and I've got to underscore this, Alex, my responsibility was the intelligent side of this thing.
[02:52:18.547 --> 02:52:23.129]  Going out and exploding somebody's heart is the operational side.
[02:52:23.129 --> 02:52:28.852]  That's the G3 instead of the G2 in military policy.
[02:52:28.852 --> 02:52:31.174]  My responsibility was intelligence.
[02:52:31.174 --> 02:52:42.479]  So when this thing appeared on my desk, and it did, there's no doubt about that, what I did was I took it to the Special Forces folks.
[02:52:42.479 --> 02:52:47.422]  Say, here, this is a technology that you probably need
[02:52:48.021 --> 02:52:48.881]  We're good to go.
[02:53:16.374 --> 02:53:16.814]  I don't know.
[02:53:16.814 --> 02:53:17.535]  I really don't know.
[02:53:44.169 --> 02:53:47.091]  No, let me turn it a different way.
[02:53:47.091 --> 02:53:48.552]  Do I believe it worked?
[02:53:48.552 --> 02:53:50.053]  Yes.
[02:53:50.053 --> 02:53:51.815]  Do I know that it worked?
[02:53:51.815 --> 02:54:00.301]  No, because I never tried it myself and I never saw any goat that ended up dead.
[02:54:00.301 --> 02:54:05.844]  However, I did see a number of testimonials that said that that worked.
[02:54:05.844 --> 02:54:07.686]  From the Army?
[02:54:07.686 --> 02:54:07.806]  Yep.
[02:54:08.536 --> 02:54:10.377]  Special Forces said it was working.
[02:54:10.377 --> 02:54:27.547]  They're not normally the type to just make things up internally, but I mean, the point is, this has been on the TV, on mainstream TV, that the Russians believed all this, and is that, I know you can't get into intelligence, but I would imagine that's where this intelligence came from, so the Army tested and tried to see if it was real.
[02:54:27.547 --> 02:54:33.870]  Well, incidentally, I don't have any problem believing that it worked.
[02:54:33.870 --> 02:54:36.652]  I do have, I cannot say that,
[02:54:37.170 --> 02:54:40.292]  Because I have no direct information.
[02:54:40.292 --> 02:54:41.332]  I wasn't there.
[02:54:41.332 --> 02:54:42.192]  I didn't see it.
[02:54:42.192 --> 02:54:45.754]  I haven't seen one explode.
[02:54:45.754 --> 02:54:52.658]  So, other than testimonials, I don't know of capability.
[02:54:52.658 --> 02:54:56.579]  But Bragg is saying it worked.
[02:54:56.579 --> 02:54:57.560]  Yes.
[02:54:57.560 --> 02:54:59.621]  Or at least that's my understanding, yes.
[02:55:01.141 --> 02:55:03.182]  Well, we've kind of gotten off the track there, but that's interesting.
[02:55:03.182 --> 02:55:08.686]  So that gets into what these elites believe and some of the things that's going on just in that little window that you saw into.
[02:55:08.686 --> 02:55:10.287]  We're going to break and start the final hour.
[02:55:10.287 --> 02:55:15.510]  I want to get into solutions with you guys and why you guys have moved to Panama.
[02:55:15.510 --> 02:55:21.694]  You're trying to teach folks how to grow organically, then export the technology all over the world so people can get ready.
[02:55:21.694 --> 02:55:23.576]  Dr. Labo has talked a lot about this.
[02:55:24.917 --> 02:55:29.440]  You guys had a very successful practice in all sorts of organizations and foundations here in the U.S.
[02:55:29.440 --> 02:55:35.504]  So I'll ask you when we get back in one minute, or 70 seconds technically, why you decided to go down to Panama.
[02:55:35.504 --> 02:55:38.946]  Last time I talked to you a year ago or so, you guys were still coming back to the U.S.
[02:55:38.946 --> 02:55:39.226]  some.
[02:55:39.226 --> 02:55:40.327]  Now you're not.
[02:55:40.327 --> 02:55:46.951]  And we've got to talk about what happened at the Codex Alimentarius meeting a few months ago that you covered in Europe as well.
[02:55:46.951 --> 02:55:54.016]  So our amazing guest with us for one more hour straight ahead, Healthfreedomusa.org is their website.
[02:55:54.216 --> 02:55:57.504]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:56:09.290 --> 02:56:10.851]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[02:56:10.851 --> 02:56:12.992]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:56:12.992 --> 02:56:14.893]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[02:56:14.893 --> 02:56:16.394]  The late, great USA.
[02:56:16.394 --> 02:56:18.155]  America, freedom to fascism.

[02:57:02.944 --> 02:57:04.545]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:57:30.859 --> 02:57:38.201]  All right, we're now into the final hour of this quick five-minute segment, but a long segment, coming up with both of our guests joining us.
[02:57:38.201 --> 02:57:44.782]  My website's InfoWars.com, of course, PrisonPlanet.com, JonesReport.com, their site's HealthFreedomUSA.org.
[02:57:44.782 --> 02:57:47.043]  We're going to put that up on the screen.
[02:57:47.043 --> 02:57:54.144]  Again, we're now live at PrisonPlanet.tv, been live for the last 55 minutes.
[02:57:54.144 --> 02:57:56.545]  And we are talking to Major General Albert
[02:57:57.563 --> 02:57:59.464]  Bert N. Stubblebine, the third U.S.
[02:57:59.464 --> 02:58:00.125]  Army retired.
[02:58:00.125 --> 02:58:03.087]  You can read his bio at healthfreedomusa.org.
[02:58:03.087 --> 02:58:09.691]  And his wife, Rima E. Lebeau, M.D., a graduate of Albert Einstein College of Medicine.
[02:58:09.691 --> 02:58:11.272]  There's so much to get into.
[02:58:11.272 --> 02:58:15.715]  Perhaps we should get a report from you guys about going to Codex Alimentarius' U.N.
[02:58:15.715 --> 02:58:19.278]  meeting and what it is and how they're trying to block our access.
[02:58:19.278 --> 02:58:20.078]  Here's an example.
[02:58:20.078 --> 02:58:23.901]  Toronto bans bottled water sales, but junk sodas remain legal.
[02:58:24.601 --> 02:58:25.521]  That's natural news.
[02:58:25.521 --> 02:58:29.262]  Mike Adams, that you guys work some with, another great guy.
[02:58:29.262 --> 02:58:33.543]  And again, if they can ban bottled water, they can start banning other foods.
[02:58:33.543 --> 02:58:35.263]  This is setting precedence.
[02:58:35.263 --> 02:58:38.144]  Tell us what's going on with that.
[02:58:38.144 --> 02:58:48.186]  Well, what's going on with that is that Codex Alimentarius is designed to make it impossible to get healthy food anywhere.
[02:58:48.186 --> 02:58:52.267]  And the reason that we came to Panama is directly related to that.
[02:58:52.267 --> 02:58:52.767]  And indeed,
[02:58:53.328 --> 02:59:11.852]  Uh, General Pebblebine and I have been met at gunpoint in a public meeting, a Codex Alimentarius Commission meeting, which is their annual big meeting where they ratify the harm that each of the committees is doing and move it forward and make it global policy.
[02:59:11.852 --> 02:59:14.412]  We have been met at gunpoint.
[02:59:14.412 --> 02:59:16.073]  Can I correct one thing?
[02:59:16.073 --> 02:59:17.653]  The gun wasn't pointing at us.
[02:59:17.653 --> 02:59:21.334]  The guns were actually in their holsters, but they did have guns.
[02:59:21.334 --> 02:59:21.694]  That's what
[02:59:22.153 --> 02:59:24.914]  She's talking about when they came to get us.
[02:59:24.914 --> 02:59:29.155]  And this is not something that other observers were treated to.
[02:59:29.155 --> 02:59:29.796]  None.
[02:59:29.796 --> 02:59:30.376]  None.
[02:59:30.376 --> 02:59:31.776]  We were sequestered.
[02:59:31.776 --> 02:59:49.502]  There was a, the main meeting room had about 180 empty seats and we were in the fourth floor gallery way up above with a guard at the door and any time either one of us tried to go to the bathroom or to get lunch or whatever, we were followed by the guards.
[02:59:49.906 --> 02:59:50.026]  Okay.
[03:00:05.225 --> 03:00:07.327]  To ordinary unarmed citizens?
[03:00:07.327 --> 03:00:15.534]  There were only a hundred extra seats and we were told that there were no extra seats, so we had to go to the upper balconies.
[03:00:15.534 --> 03:00:17.976]  Why did they choose to do that?
[03:00:17.976 --> 03:00:19.177]  To perpetrate that lie?
[03:00:19.177 --> 03:00:21.819]  Well, obviously because we're being very, very effective.
[03:00:21.819 --> 03:00:31.967]  Now, at the last Codex meeting that we attended, we were able to galvanize the African nations in their
[03:00:33.772 --> 03:00:43.320]  Their opposition to having GM food and seeds brushed down their throats to kill them, to sterilize them, and so on, because they know the score.
[03:00:43.320 --> 03:00:59.214]  Tragically, the last Codex meeting that we wanted to attend, which was in South Africa at the beginning of November, dealt very much with the issue of genetically modified food and toxins for babies and for sick people.
[03:00:59.214 --> 03:01:01.516]  And when we have attended these meetings,
[03:01:01.860 --> 03:01:18.992]  We've been able to achieve striking positive forward movement like banning fluoride from formula for normal infants through our efforts at the same committee meeting in Thailand two years ago.
[03:01:18.992 --> 03:01:25.737]  That was an incredible victory that was brought about by presenting science and by using the
[03:01:26.593 --> 03:01:41.184]  Coalition of the Unwilling that we have spent years creating at this last meeting of the same committee, the Committee on Nutrition and Foods for Special Dietary Uses, that was meeting in November in South Africa that I mentioned, we weren't there.
[03:01:41.184 --> 03:01:42.725]  Why weren't we there?
[03:01:42.725 --> 03:01:54.914]  Because the economic crisis had hit and our donations had plummeted to the point where we literally could not afford the airfare, we could not afford the hotel, we could not afford
[03:01:55.430 --> 03:02:01.592]  We'll stay there.
[03:02:01.592 --> 03:02:06.514]  We're going to try to fix that.
[03:02:06.514 --> 03:02:07.174]  Stay there, doctor.
[03:02:07.174 --> 03:02:08.014]  We've got a break.
[03:02:08.014 --> 03:02:08.314]  Come back.
[03:02:08.314 --> 03:02:12.956]  We'll try to fix that right now because I've been tracking this and you guys are doing so much of the work.
[03:02:12.956 --> 03:02:15.897]  There's literally nobody going to these meetings and resisting and educating.
[03:02:16.704 --> 03:02:18.366]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[03:02:18.366 --> 03:02:23.132]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:02:23.132 --> 03:02:26.075]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:02:26.075 --> 03:02:29.139]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:02:29.139 --> 03:02:33.865]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[03:02:34.065 --> 03:02:35.266]  If you simply prepare.
[03:02:35.266 --> 03:02:38.989]  Our elected representatives wanted a good ol' boy bailout for the special interest.
[03:02:38.989 --> 03:02:41.050]  So they ignored your screams not to do it.
[03:02:41.050 --> 03:02:42.892]  They turned off the telephones and email.
[03:02:42.892 --> 03:02:46.855]  They voted to print 850 billion dollars at least out of thin air.
[03:02:46.855 --> 03:02:49.677]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[03:02:49.677 --> 03:02:55.881]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities.
[03:02:55.881 --> 03:02:58.824]  Particularly food, beyond many Americans reach.
[03:02:58.824 --> 03:03:03.287]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days.
[03:03:03.547 --> 03:03:05.889]  Until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[03:03:05.889 --> 03:03:10.352]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast, there seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[03:03:10.352 --> 03:03:16.036]  The private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[03:03:16.036 --> 03:03:19.278]  The stores have less food, but jack up prices to stay in business.
[03:03:19.278 --> 03:03:22.420]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[03:03:22.640 --> 03:03:24.442]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[03:03:24.442 --> 03:03:28.525]  One-third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[03:03:28.525 --> 03:03:32.649]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food.
[03:03:32.649 --> 03:03:40.195]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the new old order, has a lot less control over you.
[03:03:40.195 --> 03:03:44.138]  And so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[03:03:44.138 --> 03:03:47.001]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[03:03:47.361 --> 03:03:54.345]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[03:03:54.345 --> 03:03:57.626]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[03:03:57.626 --> 03:03:58.547]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[03:03:58.547 --> 03:04:02.769]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:04:02.769 --> 03:04:09.032]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high quality, freeze-dried, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[03:04:09.032 --> 03:04:10.133]  Watch the free videos.
[03:04:10.353 --> 03:04:15.397]  Look at their online catalog or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[03:04:15.397 --> 03:04:20.381]  Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:04:20.381 --> 03:04:21.521]  Take action today.
[03:04:21.521 --> 03:04:25.645]  The first step is getting storable food.
[03:04:25.645 --> 03:04:32.290]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:04:32.290 --> 03:04:35.252]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:04:43.007 --> 03:04:52.050]  All right, Dr. Rima Lebo is our guest M.D., and of course, Major General Albert Stubblebine, the former head of Army Special Forces and the head of Army Intelligence.
[03:04:53.908 --> 03:04:56.889]  We're honored to have them both with us today.
[03:04:56.889 --> 03:05:12.973]  You were continuing, Dr. Lebo, to walk through the fact that, yeah, I have books, videos, products, advertising that funds my operation, and I have to spend most of my time, and I'm not whining about it, trying to raise money just to then have the money, you know, to do the broadcast, do the websites, make the films.
[03:05:12.973 --> 03:05:16.934]  And I understand this capitalization issue, and you guys have dropped everything the last
[03:05:17.874 --> 03:05:18.795]  Absolutely.
[03:05:18.795 --> 03:05:20.696]  Bert and I closed our medical practice.
[03:05:42.290 --> 03:05:53.012]  Which did supply us with an income and allowed us to have a lovely home and do the things that we enjoy doing, skiing and dancing and so on.
[03:05:53.012 --> 03:06:03.414]  Because this is a war and there is great evil afoot and those who stand by while evil is being perpetrated become perpetrators themselves.
[03:06:03.414 --> 03:06:06.114]  That motivates you Alex, it motivates us.
[03:06:06.114 --> 03:06:07.955]  So we closed our practice in late 2004.
[03:06:09.759 --> 03:06:13.001]  And we created the Natural Solutions Foundation.
[03:06:13.001 --> 03:06:27.610]  We created a website, healthfreedomusa.org, and then we applied the strategic and analytical skills that we used so successfully in our prior careers.
[03:06:27.610 --> 03:06:35.916]  Bert is a general involved in strategic intelligence, and I as a physician treating cases where nothing else had worked.
[03:06:35.916 --> 03:06:38.117]  And by the way, the official medical phrase
[03:06:38.601 --> 03:06:44.785]  When something hasn't worked is that, and you'll love this, the patient has failed therapy.
[03:06:44.785 --> 03:06:50.028]  Not that therapy has failed the patient, but that the patient has failed therapy.
[03:06:50.028 --> 03:06:55.871]  We closed that in order to take on this global health freedom problem.
[03:06:55.871 --> 03:07:06.478]  And one of the things that I do very well as a diagnostician in medicine is look at the whole picture and find the basic underlying
[03:07:07.247 --> 03:07:08.007]  We're good to go.
[03:07:35.908 --> 03:07:43.331]  And the murder of the constitutional body politic in the United States and elsewhere.
[03:07:43.331 --> 03:07:58.338]  I said, OK, what is the single central item here which has to be reclaimed, redefined, and put back into the hands of people in order to fix the whole damn system?
[03:07:58.338 --> 03:08:01.940]  And the answer is food.
[03:08:01.940 --> 03:08:04.661]  He who controls the world's food controls
[03:08:05.222 --> 03:08:06.323]  The world.
[03:08:06.323 --> 03:08:12.648]  That is the system that is being used at the center of world domination.
[03:08:12.648 --> 03:08:19.934]  I don't know whether other people have identified this crucial issue or not, but the fact is, that's our analysis.
[03:08:19.934 --> 03:08:31.463]  And so, we created the International Decade of Nutrition, the IDN, as part of the work of the Natural Solutions Foundation.
[03:08:31.463 --> 03:08:34.305]  And we said, we need to return the production of food
[03:08:34.724 --> 03:08:44.670]  To the people, to the farmers, so they can feed their community themselves and their social system can remain intact.
[03:08:44.670 --> 03:08:53.736]  They're not driven off their land by the multinational corporations where they go, so that they go to the cities, become the abjectly poor, starve and die.
[03:08:54.606 --> 03:09:01.430]  Uh, but instead become what they have always been, the people who essentially hold up society with food.
[03:09:01.430 --> 03:09:09.195]  And that's what globalization, by the way, by design, as you know, Dr. Leibel and General Sullivan, for the audience that may not, Agenda 21, all of this states
[03:09:09.775 --> 03:09:10.616]  Force the people.
[03:09:10.616 --> 03:09:12.597]  Take Mexico as a microcosm.
[03:09:12.597 --> 03:09:17.740]  Over the last 30 years, they forced the indigenous people off their cornfields where they've been for thousands of years.
[03:09:17.740 --> 03:09:19.542]  They forced them into Mexico City.
[03:09:19.542 --> 03:09:21.163]  Now 35 million people.
[03:09:21.163 --> 03:09:25.626]  Around a third of the children born with a syndrome where they have the tiny brain.
[03:09:25.626 --> 03:09:26.666]  Zombies, basically.
[03:09:26.666 --> 03:09:27.407]  They never even develop.
[03:09:27.407 --> 03:09:28.227]  They die.
[03:09:28.227 --> 03:09:33.151]  That's been a staging ground to move them to the United States to then drive down wages and break down
[03:09:34.042 --> 03:09:35.142]  The system here.
[03:09:35.142 --> 03:09:40.624]  Globalization is a war against the middle class and against the poor by the elite.
[03:09:40.624 --> 03:09:43.905]  And people need to go to your website, donate, support it.
[03:09:43.905 --> 03:09:45.465]  I think it's very worthwhile.
[03:09:45.465 --> 03:09:53.988]  But also spread the word about what you're doing and take the materials you've developed and deploy that with these natural systems of growing.
[03:09:53.988 --> 03:09:56.528]  I mean, you've developed some wonderful systems.
[03:09:56.528 --> 03:10:01.650]  So let's talk about some of those as well and then get General Stubblebine to chime in.
[03:10:01.650 --> 03:10:02.670]  But please continue.
[03:10:03.874 --> 03:10:14.544]  Let me suggest, thank you Alex, let me suggest that people go to our website and view a video there called Nutricide, N-U-T-R-I-C-I-D-E.
[03:10:14.544 --> 03:10:24.452]  This is of extreme importance, and by the way Alex, we have to work out a way that you can carry this as part of the wonderful information that you disseminate.
[03:10:24.452 --> 03:10:27.235]  This Nutricide talks about the fact that
[03:10:28.243 --> 03:10:28.403]  Yes.
[03:10:46.112 --> 03:10:48.954]  And therefore eliminate 90% of world disease.
[03:10:48.954 --> 03:10:52.455]  And let me very quickly deal with the overpopulation issue.
[03:10:52.455 --> 03:10:55.197]  People say, yeah, but there really are too many people.
[03:10:55.197 --> 03:11:09.585]  The surest, quickest, and most efficient way to bring down the birth rate on a voluntary basis and enhance the quality of life in the community is to educate women, not to sterilize men and women.
[03:11:09.585 --> 03:11:11.586]  So we're talking about an alternative there.
[03:11:12.020 --> 03:11:19.803]  Men and women need to be educated, and that works in every culture, whether it's Muslim or Christian or Atheist or whatever.
[03:11:19.803 --> 03:11:27.705]  So, we decided that we needed to reclaim the production of food and demonstrate that it was possible to eliminate world hunger.
[03:11:27.705 --> 03:11:37.248]  We have some astounding technologies which have absolutely no environmental downside, but can increase food production by up to 600%.
[03:11:39.710 --> 03:11:40.030]  Thank you.
[03:12:03.451 --> 03:12:17.844]  Uh, create an educational system here in Panama where we can teach farmers how to farm without pollution and how to create their own energy supply through methane digestion using the waste of the farm.
[03:12:17.844 --> 03:12:21.527]  Human waste, animal waste, and agricultural waste.
[03:12:21.527 --> 03:12:29.114]  We don't need petroleum to have light, to have energy, to run our cars.
[03:12:29.114 --> 03:12:30.375]  Absolutely irrelevant.
[03:12:30.928 --> 03:12:41.270]  We, besides the fact that it's so damaging economically and environmentally, we can teach farmers how to bring that to their communities.
[03:12:41.270 --> 03:12:45.151]  So we came to Panama, and we selected Panama for many, many reasons.
[03:12:45.151 --> 03:12:56.114]  And by the way, the place on the planet most likely to weather this economic cataclysm that's been delivered to us and will get worse and worse, we believe, is the place best suited
[03:12:56.707 --> 03:13:00.029]  For stability, economically, is Panama.
[03:13:00.029 --> 03:13:01.930]  Very interesting.
[03:13:01.930 --> 03:13:08.813]  At the same time, we did not choose the hot, sticky areas of Panama.
[03:13:08.813 --> 03:13:11.755]  We chose the highlands of Panama.
[03:13:11.755 --> 03:13:21.760]  Temperate, beautiful, bountiful, year-long, spring-like weather, which means we have a 365-day growing season.
[03:13:21.760 --> 03:13:26.362]  And the foundation, Natural Solutions Foundation, has been able to purchase
[03:13:26.803 --> 03:13:26.863]  The
[03:13:45.037 --> 03:13:48.680]  Genetically modified genetic drift.
[03:13:48.680 --> 03:13:53.804]  And by the way, as you know, I mean a lot of other people are getting concerned and trying to do similar things.
[03:13:53.804 --> 03:14:04.592]  People, not just from the alternative media, but instinctively are moving out to farms, moving out to homesteads, are getting heirloom seeds, are getting ready.
[03:14:04.592 --> 03:14:08.555]  So I commend the research you're doing because that's going to help so many people.
[03:14:08.555 --> 03:14:09.956]  So folks that want to find out more?
[03:14:10.456 --> 03:14:11.456]  Absolutely.
[03:14:11.456 --> 03:14:15.517]  They better be thinking about it and better be taking action, not just thinking about it.
[03:14:15.517 --> 03:14:24.358]  They need to take action, Alex, because if they don't, they're going to be missing the food that they need to sustain themselves.
[03:14:24.358 --> 03:14:27.979]  Well, General, what would... Not everybody goes to a farm, Alex.
[03:14:27.979 --> 03:14:30.580]  Victory Gardens.
[03:14:30.580 --> 03:14:31.640]  Absolutely.
[03:14:31.640 --> 03:14:39.001]  Now, I don't know how many of your listeners remember the Victory Gardens or have read about the Victory Gardens in World War II, but in order to
[03:14:39.671 --> 03:14:52.817]  Um, save petroleum in order to save labor in order to, um, allow people to continue to work in the, um, uh, in the industries that were producing the war machine.
[03:14:52.817 --> 03:15:01.620]  Um, people were told that they needed to grow their own food and that would help speed the victory against the enemy, the Germans and the Japanese.
[03:15:01.620 --> 03:15:03.741]  And indeed people did grow their own food.
[03:15:03.741 --> 03:15:07.863]  They created what was called Victory Garden and they remembered again,
[03:15:08.459 --> 03:15:12.782]  Even urbanized people remembered again how to grow their own food.
[03:15:12.782 --> 03:15:15.484]  Well, we need Victory Gardens on Spheroid.
[03:15:15.484 --> 03:15:16.505]  And it's also fun.
[03:15:16.505 --> 03:15:18.146]  I'll tell you what's happening in Austin.
[03:15:18.146 --> 03:15:23.610]  A lot of people are going out to pieces of property, two, three, four acres, and just growing masses of food.
[03:15:24.931 --> 03:15:29.075]  I know one fellow from his grandparents gave him, I think it's like 20 acres, the middle of town.
[03:15:29.075 --> 03:15:33.539]  And he's got a huge garden there with two growing seasons a year.
[03:15:33.539 --> 03:15:36.922]  And so absolutely, this is what humans are designed to do.
[03:15:36.922 --> 03:15:39.784]  So I hope folks will visit healthfreedomusa.org.
[03:15:39.784 --> 03:15:42.106]  They can sign up for your news alerts and information.
[03:15:42.106 --> 03:15:45.029]  They can get the videos and materials there on the site.
[03:15:45.029 --> 03:15:48.492]  And that will certainly support.
[03:15:48.492 --> 03:15:50.133]  We invite people to come visit.
[03:15:50.529 --> 03:16:03.256]  We invite people to come learn because we're going to be teaching urban people how to grow enough food to feed a family of four in four feet of square foot space.
[03:16:03.256 --> 03:16:11.001]  Four square feet can feed a family of four fresh vegetables for an entire year with virtually no cost.
[03:16:11.001 --> 03:16:13.302]  You can do that in your apartment with a couple of grow lights.
[03:16:13.772 --> 03:16:16.195]  This is something that every single person can do.
[03:16:16.195 --> 03:16:18.077]  We'll be launching a new newsletter.
[03:16:18.077 --> 03:16:18.658]  Okay, stay there.
[03:16:18.658 --> 03:16:19.199]  We gotta break.
[03:16:19.199 --> 03:16:20.640]  We gotta break.
[03:16:20.640 --> 03:16:25.046]  And in fact, we'll probably just skip this break, but here we go.
[03:16:25.046 --> 03:16:27.829]  Okay, I'm gonna go ahead and skip this break, John.
[03:16:28.626 --> 03:16:30.347]  For the internet only audience.
[03:16:30.347 --> 03:16:34.130]  Dr. Labo and General Stubblebine, we're going to be back to the full audience in a couple minutes.
[03:16:34.130 --> 03:16:47.919]  I want to now shift gears, and I understand getting prepared, getting ready is the way to go, but obviously you know videos are the way to really educate the whole world who can't come to Panama, and I know you guys have produced some great documentaries and talks.
[03:16:47.919 --> 03:16:51.921]  Are you planning to make some videos about what you're showing and doing down there?
[03:16:53.286 --> 03:16:54.087]  You bet.
[03:16:54.087 --> 03:17:01.212]  And as a matter of fact, if you want to co-op that one, if you want to collaborate on that, Alex, I'd be thrilled.
[03:17:01.212 --> 03:17:04.895]  Well, I'd love to, and I'm always pinned down here, putting out a million different fires.
[03:17:04.895 --> 03:17:08.258]  But, you know, I wouldn't mind coming down and seeing your operation in Panama.
[03:17:08.258 --> 03:17:10.680]  I've never... We'd love to have you.
[03:17:10.680 --> 03:17:13.602]  I've been down to Central America, but I've never been to Panama.
[03:17:13.602 --> 03:17:15.904]  So... We'd love to have you, Alex.
[03:17:15.904 --> 03:17:16.444]  Absolutely.
[03:17:17.918 --> 03:17:23.263]  Well, what I'll do then is I'll certainly try to figure out some time to get down there before everything goes to hell in a handbasket.
[03:17:23.263 --> 03:17:33.131]  You know, I envy you guys being up there in the mountain rainforest, because I'm right here in the... Beautiful.
[03:17:33.131 --> 03:17:34.412]  I bet it is magnificent.
[03:17:34.412 --> 03:17:37.575]  The facility here is almost beyond imagining.
[03:17:37.575 --> 03:17:42.118]  You stick anything in the ground and it flourishes.
[03:17:42.118 --> 03:17:46.302]  Unfortunately, even though it's illegal in Panama, the government of Panama is
[03:17:46.741 --> 03:17:56.883]  releasing genetically modified organisms at a ferocious cost and I have compiled a dossier on that and have presented it to a number of people that I thought might be able to do something about it.
[03:17:56.883 --> 03:17:59.584]  That is my next question.
[03:17:59.584 --> 03:18:00.664]  We'll be back in two minutes.
[03:18:00.664 --> 03:18:08.266]  I want to get into that area because I was going to ask you about Brazil and Panama and Africa and even in the U.S.
[03:18:08.266 --> 03:18:08.926]  and Canada.
[03:18:08.926 --> 03:18:09.546]  They've caught them.
[03:18:09.546 --> 03:18:12.627]  This has been in major news, as you know, for the audience where
[03:18:13.928 --> 03:18:23.801]  Companies are putting their seeds out, planting their test fields next to major farming growth belts of similar crops to contaminate everything.
[03:18:23.801 --> 03:18:25.404]  And I want to talk about that agenda.
[03:18:25.404 --> 03:18:26.906]  And General Stubblebine can speak to this.
[03:18:26.906 --> 03:18:27.546]  Take Iraq.
[03:18:29.449 --> 03:18:34.695]  One of the first things they did was make the Iraqis only take GMO crops.
[03:18:34.695 --> 03:18:35.896]  That's right.
[03:18:35.896 --> 03:18:39.300]  Exactly right.
[03:18:39.300 --> 03:18:42.823]  I recall it's in their constitution that that's the only thing they can use.
[03:18:42.823 --> 03:18:48.369]  Yes, so reading the IMF and World Bank documents, the UN Biological Diversity Assessments and others,
[03:18:49.230 --> 03:19:00.665]  They admit this is a weapon, this isn't even denied, and so it's all about destroying these ancient cultures, these ancient varieties, making these countries dependent when only GMO is in their country.
[03:19:00.665 --> 03:19:06.032]  So, and I know you guys know this better than I do, but for the audience, some may not know it, let's walk through
[03:19:06.873 --> 03:19:10.756]  What they're doing in Iraq, what they're doing in Africa, what you've caught them doing in Panama.
[03:19:10.756 --> 03:19:18.401]  I know in Brazil, it's super illegal, but they go in spending money to contaminate things and why that's so important.
[03:19:18.401 --> 03:19:20.923]  We'll be back in one minute, okay?
[03:19:20.923 --> 03:19:21.363]  Here we go.
[03:19:21.363 --> 03:19:25.767]  I'm Steve Shank.
[03:19:25.767 --> 03:19:31.891]  For the past several months, folks have constantly asked me to give them the date as to when they should be finished stocking up on food.
[03:19:32.711 --> 03:19:43.342]  We've been so beaten up by stock market banking, housing and unemployment crashes that we're desensitized and frozen and active like the frog being unknowingly cooked in gradually increasingly hot water.
[03:19:43.342 --> 03:19:44.283]  Well, snap out of it.
[03:19:44.283 --> 03:19:45.784]  We now have a deadline.
[03:19:45.784 --> 03:19:47.246]  Joe Biden said it's going to happen.
[03:19:47.819 --> 03:19:59.702]  Former Secretary of State Colin Powell went on CBS Meet the Press and pointed to about January 22nd as the time a major international incident would force the new president to make unpopular decisions.
[03:19:59.702 --> 03:20:05.844]  Well, I take the general of this word and my best advice is to have your food in your possession prior to the inauguration.
[03:20:05.844 --> 03:20:11.286]  Contact efoodsdirect.com for your supplies prior to this deadline for disaster.
[03:20:11.286 --> 03:20:15.027]  Ask yourself, is it better to have too much too soon or too little too late?
[03:20:15.623 --> 03:20:16.824]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web eFoodsDirect.com
[03:20:49.130 --> 03:20:50.953]  Yeah!
[03:20:50.953 --> 03:20:55.058]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:20:55.058 --> 03:20:57.161]  Got about 40 minutes left with our guest.
[03:20:58.442 --> 03:21:00.903]  I guess 36 minutes would be technical.
[03:21:00.903 --> 03:21:14.507]  I want to take a few calls for our guests, specifically on Codex Alimentaria, specifically on GMO, the poisons, the toxins in the food, coming up in the next final segments at 1-800-259-9231.
[03:21:14.507 --> 03:21:20.328]  Next on my list, I had Iraq forcing them in their constitution to only grow GMO.
[03:21:20.328 --> 03:21:21.949]  I mean, that's tyranny right there.
[03:21:21.949 --> 03:21:25.930]  Even if GMO was, quote, good, why make them only buy it from Monsanto?
[03:21:26.550 --> 03:21:28.010]  Well, in Iraq, they couldn't even say their native seeds.
[03:21:28.010 --> 03:21:29.011]  In other words, they had to use
[03:21:52.935 --> 03:21:53.976]  The GMO.
[03:21:53.976 --> 03:22:04.288]  I mean, it's absolutely crazy when you tell a person that it's illegal to save his seed from his last crop so that he can grow the next one.
[03:22:04.288 --> 03:22:05.730]  But that's what they're doing.
[03:22:05.730 --> 03:22:09.475]  And that's what they, then, they give them nothing but the GMO.
[03:22:09.475 --> 03:22:11.457]  So now they're totally dependent upon the GMO.
[03:22:12.850 --> 03:22:15.551]  The first year, a lot of times, they give it to them free.
[03:22:15.551 --> 03:22:33.074]  The next year, of course, they have to pay for it, and of course they don't have enough money to pay for it, so now they're destitute and off their farm, and the large commercial outfits have taken over all of the little tiny farmers' plots.
[03:22:33.074 --> 03:22:40.736]  So, if you think that that isn't just excruciating to watch, and we have seen it in India over and over and over again,
[03:22:41.380 --> 03:22:43.103]  We're good.
[03:22:53.420 --> 03:22:54.400]  Other parts of the world.
[03:22:54.400 --> 03:22:57.001]  We have literally seen it in India.
[03:22:57.001 --> 03:22:57.181]  Crazy!
[03:23:14.625 --> 03:23:16.346]  Well, it's not crazy or evil, though.
[03:23:16.346 --> 03:23:18.788]  I mean, out in the open, and then here it is.
[03:23:18.788 --> 03:23:23.052]  Toronto bans bottled water sales citywide, but junk sodas remain legal.
[03:23:23.052 --> 03:23:26.334]  Again, they want you drinking the fluoride water.
[03:23:26.334 --> 03:23:33.079]  But again, the precedent of telling Canadians, and now San Francisco's trying it, you can't drink the water you want.
[03:23:33.079 --> 03:23:37.583]  I mean, this is an incredible precedent of tyranny.
[03:23:37.583 --> 03:23:38.984]  Yes.
[03:23:38.984 --> 03:23:40.445]  Yes.
[03:23:40.445 --> 03:23:40.645]  Yes.
[03:23:41.340 --> 03:23:41.840]  Unbelievable.
[03:23:58.652 --> 03:24:00.853]  Let me jump in here.
[03:24:00.853 --> 03:24:10.399]  Not only are we talking about the 128,000 Gujarati farmers who have killed themselves because of GMO cotton, directly because of GMO cotton.
[03:24:10.399 --> 03:24:11.819]  And that's mainstream news.
[03:24:11.819 --> 03:24:13.680]  Pardon me?
[03:24:13.680 --> 03:24:14.781]  I mean, that's admitted, by the way.
[03:24:14.781 --> 03:24:15.842]  They're just killing themselves.
[03:24:15.842 --> 03:24:16.322]  Explain that.
[03:24:16.322 --> 03:24:18.823]  What's happening in India?
[03:24:18.823 --> 03:24:24.046]  What happens is that the GMO seed is given to the farmer.
[03:24:24.046 --> 03:24:25.267]  Now, remember, farmers
[03:24:25.874 --> 03:24:31.137]  In most of the world are marginal people in terms of the money economy.
[03:24:31.137 --> 03:24:32.859]  They're on the edge.
[03:24:32.859 --> 03:24:34.520]  But they have no money.
[03:24:34.520 --> 03:24:38.162]  And if their crop fails, they're in very big trouble.
[03:24:38.162 --> 03:24:44.426]  So the GMO people come along, Monsanto comes along, and they give farmers GMO cotton.
[03:24:44.426 --> 03:24:46.527]  And the operative word is give.
[03:24:46.527 --> 03:24:50.470]  Give farmers GMO cotton seed for free the first year.
[03:24:50.470 --> 03:24:52.471]  And they say, don't worry about it, you'll pay me next
[03:24:52.901 --> 03:24:53.201]  Thank you.
[03:25:11.480 --> 03:25:30.770]  The GMO crops have in large measure been created in order to consume high levels of pesticide, and the pesticides are like glyphosate, the second most toxic chemical, non-ionizing radiation chemical known to cause cancer.
[03:25:30.770 --> 03:25:36.873]  And I saw mainline news, mainline news that these GMO cottons leach poison into you when you wear it.
[03:25:38.070 --> 03:25:50.753]  Exactly, and we've run a whole series on Morgellons, which is a nightmare brought to you from above through the chemtrail spraying and from your clothing through the GMO modification.
[03:25:51.232 --> 03:25:54.355]  We're talking about an intolerably horrible disease.
[03:25:54.355 --> 03:25:54.655]  You know what?
[03:25:54.655 --> 03:25:56.497]  I'm going to skip this break so we have time here.
[03:25:56.497 --> 03:25:58.359]  We're going to break about 20 seconds on the internet.
[03:25:58.359 --> 03:25:58.879]  We'll still be live.
[03:25:58.879 --> 03:26:00.340]  We're going to come back and take calls.
[03:26:00.340 --> 03:26:05.725]  When we get back, I want to ask General Stubblebine about chemtrails, his expert opinion on that, as well as Dr. Labo.
[03:26:05.725 --> 03:26:11.631]  But let's continue talking about how they're forcing the GMO into countries right now with our guest.
[03:26:14.560 --> 03:26:19.124]  Okay, let's continue though, then let's come back with more gallons and back with chemtrails for the full audience.
[03:26:29.444 --> 03:26:43.332]  And the second year, they don't have the money to pay back, nor do they have the money for the new crop seeds, because GMO seeds can't be saved, as General Stubblebine was saying, and as you've said so many times on your program.
[03:26:43.332 --> 03:26:49.175]  And now we have farmers who are destitute, and Monsanto quite happily kicks them off the land.
[03:26:49.175 --> 03:26:53.418]  They migrate to the cities where their families have no hope whatsoever.
[03:26:53.418 --> 03:26:55.719]  And if you've never seen abject poverty,
[03:26:56.099 --> 03:27:04.125]  In Africa, in Ethiopia, specifically Ethiopia, Kenya, South Africa, if you've never been to India, you have no concept what that means.
[03:27:04.125 --> 03:27:12.331]  You're talking cities of 50 million, 20 million people, dead bodies laying around, human feces everywhere, hundreds of thousands of starving children.
[03:27:12.331 --> 03:27:14.653]  It's unbelievable.
[03:27:14.653 --> 03:27:20.537]  Let me say, Alex, that I will live for the rest of my days with an image of a starving Ethiopian woman
[03:27:20.951 --> 03:27:30.646]  Making the international sign for Feed Me, bringing her fingers to her lips, staring at me with absolutely dead hopeless eyes.
[03:27:30.646 --> 03:27:33.310]  I will live with that graven in my consciousness.
[03:27:33.849 --> 03:27:35.150]  For the rest of my life.
[03:27:35.150 --> 03:27:36.751]  That is unnecessary.
[03:27:36.751 --> 03:27:42.355]  And it's being brought about by globalization for the purposes of the globalizers who are fundamentalists.
[03:28:05.169 --> 03:28:28.736]  So, the food supply is devastated, the cotton supply, the cotton won't grow, the farmers are pushed off their land, Monsanto gets the land, and now we have 128,000 heads of families dying primarily by drinking a half a cup of the very pesticide that has bankrupted them.
[03:28:29.252 --> 03:28:38.316]  We are talking about people, the face of humanity, being altered by this technology for its own purposes.
[03:28:38.316 --> 03:28:42.398]  It is not necessary to eat this food.
[03:28:42.398 --> 03:28:45.799]  It is not necessary to wear these products.
[03:28:45.799 --> 03:28:50.881]  And for wicked, yuppies, self-centered people, you're not escaping it.
[03:28:50.881 --> 03:28:51.622]  Yeah, I hear them laugh.
[03:28:51.622 --> 03:28:52.362]  Yeah, get rid of them.
[03:28:52.362 --> 03:28:52.882]  They're black.
[03:28:52.882 --> 03:28:54.743]  They're Indian.
[03:28:54.743 --> 03:28:55.964]  You are not immune.
[03:28:55.964 --> 03:28:58.405]  This is all being done to you as a soft kill weapon.
[03:28:59.085 --> 03:29:00.605]  It's just being done slower.
[03:29:00.605 --> 03:29:03.506]  They haven't turned the ambient background up as high.
[03:29:03.506 --> 03:29:06.347]  But farms and ranches, most of them are being lost.
[03:29:06.347 --> 03:29:08.327]  I mean, most are gone.
[03:29:08.327 --> 03:29:10.047]  Our society is now being imploded.
[03:29:10.047 --> 03:29:18.649]  So now we, we, for being passive and not being involved and not fighting back like General Stubblebine was saying, we are now sowed the wind.
[03:29:18.649 --> 03:29:20.029]  We're going to reap the whirlwind.
[03:29:20.029 --> 03:29:27.511]  And as we come back, finish up, Dr. Labo and General Stubblebine, on what you're seeing in Central America with them forcing it in.
[03:29:27.511 --> 03:29:27.931]  Here we go.
[03:29:32.864 --> 03:29:35.069]  Back live, got 27 minutes left.
[03:29:35.069 --> 03:29:36.692]  I want to go to at least five of your calls.
[03:29:36.692 --> 03:29:39.679]  Sean, Toby, Robert, Sherry, and Dan.
[03:29:39.679 --> 03:29:41.162]  From Washington to Illinois.
[03:29:41.162 --> 03:29:43.527]  Maybe get a few foreign callers in there as well.
[03:29:49.466 --> 03:29:54.790]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, let's try to compartmentalize the info now, get it out as fast as possible.
[03:29:54.790 --> 03:30:01.395]  I want to go to calls here in just a few minutes with both of our guests.
[03:30:01.395 --> 03:30:14.865]  Finishing up, how they force the GMO into countries, how it devastates the people, even where it's illegal, they run what I would call, what the news calls, intelligence operations to go in and secretly plant this stuff in research facilities.
[03:30:16.184 --> 03:30:17.685]  Absolutely.
[03:30:17.685 --> 03:30:26.110]  I want to say that there's a famine predicted by very, very intelligent folks looking at what's happening to our food supply.
[03:30:26.110 --> 03:30:30.653]  I've posted an article on our Health Freedom blog called The Famine of 2009.
[03:30:30.653 --> 03:30:34.635]  If anybody in America thinks that we're not reaping that whirlwind, as you said,
[03:30:35.015 --> 03:30:42.340]  Wait until their plates are empty and there are food riots, because that's where we're going, unless we start growing our own.
[03:30:42.340 --> 03:30:55.410]  And yes, Panama has been contaminated, Brazil, New Zealand was contaminated, even though it was a GMO-free zone by national decree, or by national law, the U.S.
[03:30:55.410 --> 03:30:55.730]  shipped
[03:30:56.431 --> 03:30:57.151]  And they're now putting
[03:31:13.968 --> 03:31:26.613]  Cross-species pigs, mixing them, I just saw this in the BBC a few weeks ago, that have had human genetics added to them so the body parts that can be used, the vowels and things, won't be rejected.
[03:31:26.613 --> 03:31:35.157]  They're now saying it's safe for us to eat cloned food, milk from cloned cows, and to eat cows that are part human.
[03:31:35.157 --> 03:31:36.017]  Speak to that.
[03:31:36.017 --> 03:31:37.698]  I mean, the nightmare just goes on and on.
[03:31:37.698 --> 03:31:39.979]  And then General Stubblebine, Kim Trails.
[03:31:42.093 --> 03:31:58.444]  Well, the chemtrails are another phenomenon that's being used to, you know, essentially poison all of the folks that are going to be subjected to wherever the chemtrails finally, or the pieces of the chemtrails finally land.
[03:31:58.444 --> 03:32:01.466]  These things, you can see them.
[03:32:01.466 --> 03:32:09.291]  Normally, if you look up in the sky and you see an airplane and a little fume or a plum comes out of the rear,
[03:32:10.819 --> 03:32:16.020]  That normally is a contrail, and it disappears.
[03:32:16.020 --> 03:32:23.523]  So you hold up your fingers about two inches, and that should disappear.
[03:32:23.523 --> 03:32:25.763]  These are not contrails.
[03:32:25.763 --> 03:32:29.984]  They are chemtrails, and they do not disappear.
[03:32:29.984 --> 03:32:39.027]  The plane will fly all the way across from horizon to horizon, putting out these chemical toxins
[03:32:39.814 --> 03:32:44.958]  That essentially then fall to the ground, fall to the earth.
[03:32:44.958 --> 03:32:45.838]  And what do you do?
[03:32:45.838 --> 03:32:47.980]  You breathe them.
[03:32:47.980 --> 03:32:50.181]  You breathe this stuff.
[03:32:50.181 --> 03:32:53.224]  Furthermore, what they do is they crisscross.
[03:32:53.224 --> 03:33:00.429]  So it looks like a tic-tac-toe up in the sky or a set of tic-tac-toes up in the sky.
[03:33:00.429 --> 03:33:08.094]  And obviously what they're trying to do is to inundate an entire country or inundate an entire area.
[03:33:08.775 --> 03:33:09.797]  Well, I was gonna...
[03:33:20.185 --> 03:33:29.113]  Deformed genetic material, partial red blood cell virus, aluminum, barium, beryllium does not belong in your body.
[03:33:29.113 --> 03:33:33.396]  Well, let me add just something briefly here because it's so important.
[03:33:33.396 --> 03:33:45.487]  I'm sure you guys know about this, but in case you don't, I've now learned in the last year they call it, you know, these aerosol spraying programs and hundreds of universities, Department of Energy and others, they admit, but they don't call it chemtrails,
[03:33:46.437 --> 03:33:52.400]  That it is secret programs for testing the weather and doing other things and to test global warming.
[03:33:52.400 --> 03:34:14.771]  They admit that they are doing it now and the reason they had to do it was so many government people who were compartmentalized were asking and confirming and testing that they had to come out and admit and now it's in high school textbooks that oh yes they're spraying that as a sunscreen for the earth and claiming it's weather modification but I mean I'm just throwing that out.
[03:34:14.771 --> 03:34:15.391]  Your take on that?
[03:34:16.713 --> 03:34:17.413]  Absolutely.
[03:34:17.413 --> 03:34:19.634]  That's what they tell you.
[03:34:19.634 --> 03:34:25.096]  One of the reasons that we're in Panama is that there are no chemtrails.
[03:34:25.096 --> 03:34:32.059]  Now, General Stubblebine and I have seen a chemtrail here in the highlands of Panama, but it was over Costa Rica.
[03:34:32.059 --> 03:34:34.820]  There are no chemtrails in Panama.
[03:34:34.820 --> 03:34:44.564]  And we believe that that's because the very intentional decision that the elite have decided that there are going to be enclaves
[03:34:45.123 --> 03:34:51.467]  Where they foolishly think that they can separate the damage they're doing from the earth from where they live.
[03:34:51.467 --> 03:34:54.249]  Yeah, why has Bush bought all this land in Paraguay?
[03:34:54.249 --> 03:34:57.611]  Why is Dick Cheney moving to Dubai?
[03:34:57.611 --> 03:34:58.752]  Is he moving to Dubai?
[03:34:58.752 --> 03:34:59.252]  I missed that one.
[03:34:59.252 --> 03:35:02.074]  Yeah, he bought a big house there and dumped his dollars.
[03:35:02.074 --> 03:35:05.536]  Probably because there's no extradition.
[03:35:05.536 --> 03:35:12.821]  But, in Paraguay, the piece of land that the Bush family bought, that Bush bought for the family, is
[03:35:14.460 --> 03:35:18.667]  Situated directly over the world's largest freshwater aquifer.
[03:35:18.667 --> 03:35:24.776]  And water is going to be another issue, because there's not going to be enough water to go around.
[03:35:24.776 --> 03:35:26.919]  Good God, I want to go to some phone calls here.
[03:35:29.730 --> 03:35:33.514]  Well, I didn't notice it when I was on active duty because I was too busy believing, doing,
[03:35:55.919 --> 03:36:05.727]  I really believed in what I was doing, so I wasn't paying any attention to the picture that I now see.
[03:36:05.727 --> 03:36:14.934]  However, about two years ago, suddenly, all of the dots, just like you and I were talking earlier, suddenly the dots don't
[03:36:21.081 --> 03:36:22.342]  Just appear to be dogs.
[03:36:22.342 --> 03:36:32.305]  Suddenly there's a picture that just sort of jumps out of the screen and you hit you in the face and you say, oh my God, oh my God, what the hell is this?
[03:36:32.305 --> 03:36:34.626]  And then you say, no, it can't be true.
[03:36:34.626 --> 03:36:38.407]  And you try to make it go back into the screen and it won't.
[03:36:38.407 --> 03:36:40.168]  And so it pops out again.
[03:36:40.168 --> 03:36:43.729]  You say, all right, it's real.
[03:36:43.729 --> 03:36:46.931]  Now, what do I do about it?
[03:36:46.931 --> 03:36:50.452]  And so this occurred after I retired.
[03:36:51.355 --> 03:37:04.806]  This sudden realization that all of the things that I believed in, all of the things that I fought for in my country were a bunch of baloney.
[03:37:04.806 --> 03:37:11.292]  I'd been sold a bill of goods and been duped.
[03:37:11.292 --> 03:37:20.179]  Incidentally, it's very, very difficult to admit that you did not see it at the time, that you were duped, that you'd been taken for a ride.
[03:37:20.999 --> 03:37:27.382]  And that all of this was going on even way back when.
[03:37:27.382 --> 03:37:29.323]  Well, it's all compartmentalized.
[03:37:29.323 --> 03:37:29.483]  1984.
[03:37:29.483 --> 03:37:30.963]  Well, it's all compartmentalized.
[03:37:30.963 --> 03:37:35.085]  I mean, it's all compartmentalized, sir, as you know, so you're certainly not guilty.
[03:37:35.085 --> 03:37:38.267]  You would be guilty if you then figured it out and then didn't do something.
[03:37:38.267 --> 03:37:41.248]  Let's jam in some final calls here for our amazing guest.
[03:37:41.248 --> 03:37:46.570]  Sean, in Washington, you're on the air with Major General Stubblebine and Dr. Labo.
[03:37:46.570 --> 03:37:46.910]  Go ahead.
[03:37:46.910 --> 03:37:50.272]  Is this General Albert Stubblebine III?
[03:37:51.820 --> 03:37:52.260]  Yes it is.
[03:37:52.260 --> 03:37:52.880]  Go ahead, sir.
[03:37:52.880 --> 03:37:54.721]  You got a question or comment?
[03:37:54.721 --> 03:37:56.961]  Uh, yeah, I want to ask him a question.
[03:37:56.961 --> 03:37:58.421]  Um, were you the head of U.S.
[03:37:58.421 --> 03:38:02.742]  Army Intelligence Instrum at Fort Meade in 1981-84 with General Okuno?
[03:38:02.742 --> 03:38:03.662]  Were you his CO?
[03:38:03.662 --> 03:38:07.743]  Were you also a Director or Head of Psychotechnology?
[03:38:07.743 --> 03:38:08.363]  Hold on, sir.
[03:38:08.363 --> 03:38:09.303]  Your phone's echoing.
[03:38:09.303 --> 03:38:11.583]  Just talk slow so we can understand you.
[03:38:11.583 --> 03:38:14.004]  I can't understand a word he says.
[03:38:14.004 --> 03:38:16.684]  I heard something about were you the Director of Intelligence.
[03:38:16.684 --> 03:38:19.285]  And then, I mean, you have to talk clearly, sir.
[03:38:19.285 --> 03:38:20.505]  Okay, I'll say again.
[03:38:21.294 --> 03:38:22.955]  Were you the director of U.S.
[03:38:22.955 --> 03:38:30.361]  Army Intelligence in SCOM between 1981 and 1984 at Fort Meade, Maryland?
[03:38:30.361 --> 03:38:32.082]  Yes.
[03:38:32.082 --> 03:38:43.992]  Were you also a director or head of Psychotronics, Inc., which produced non-lethal psychotronic or developed weapons for the Army?
[03:38:43.992 --> 03:38:45.053]  Psychotronics?
[03:38:45.053 --> 03:38:46.714]  No.
[03:38:46.714 --> 03:38:50.177]  Did you also run the GOAT Lab at Fort Bragg, North Carolina?
[03:38:50.967 --> 03:38:52.228]  Well, he talked about that earlier.
[03:38:52.228 --> 03:38:54.270]  No, he said he passed that information on.
[03:38:54.270 --> 03:38:54.330]  No.
[03:38:54.330 --> 03:38:58.013]  The answer to that is no.
[03:38:58.013 --> 03:39:11.663]  I guess I just find this gentleman highly uncredible, given that you ran an army intelligence unit in the 80s, working with Michael Aquino, who started OTO, the Temple of Sex.
[03:39:11.663 --> 03:39:14.265]  It is run by satanic cults.
[03:39:14.265 --> 03:39:16.948]  Okay, well, let's talk about Aquino, and then I'm going to let you go.
[03:39:16.948 --> 03:39:18.469]  Did you work with that Aquino character?
[03:39:20.339 --> 03:39:20.939]  The Kino?
[03:39:20.939 --> 03:39:21.920]  I don't remember.
[03:39:21.920 --> 03:39:24.981]  That doesn't ring a bell.
[03:39:24.981 --> 03:39:28.602]  I was the commander of the Army Intelligence and Security Command.
[03:39:28.602 --> 03:39:33.564]  I was responsible for all of the Army Intelligence and Security Command forces around the world.
[03:39:45.521 --> 03:39:48.244]  I had units all over the world.
[03:39:48.244 --> 03:39:48.504]  Very twisted.
[03:40:01.857 --> 03:40:02.717]  Well, I mean, it's ridiculous.
[03:40:02.717 --> 03:40:05.899]  He has me in there scared of werewolves, okay?
[03:40:05.899 --> 03:40:26.886]  I mean, it's dark satire, and people that don't know that don't understand it, because I was like in Northern California in these big trees going, man, this is like something out of a 1930s werewolf movie, because, you know, there was fog like four feet deep, and it looked like those old movies, and I thought that was always, you know, something that didn't exist, and I was like, wow, you know, the fog's really, really thick here.
[03:40:26.886 --> 03:40:29.187]  I've never seen fog this thick, like in a movie.
[03:40:29.807 --> 03:40:36.059]  And in the book he has me scared in my hotel room of vampires and goblins.
[03:40:36.059 --> 03:40:38.143]  So, it's not true.
[03:40:38.143 --> 03:40:41.889]  General Stubblebine told you, without you even calling, that
[03:40:43.055 --> 03:40:47.278]  That this was passed across his desk and sent to Fort Bragg because I asked him about it.
[03:40:47.278 --> 03:40:49.079]  And yes, they were looking into all that stuff.
[03:40:49.079 --> 03:40:51.521]  And so, I don't think he was listening earlier.
[03:40:51.521 --> 03:40:55.023]  And the other issue is the fruits are what are important.
[03:40:55.023 --> 03:40:58.286]  They're warning people about GMO crops.
[03:40:58.286 --> 03:40:59.867]  They're warning people about real things.
[03:40:59.867 --> 03:41:02.669]  It's a red herring, but we let you ask your questions.
[03:41:02.669 --> 03:41:04.090]  Toby, in Indiana.
[03:41:04.090 --> 03:41:05.051]  Toby, you're on the air.
[03:41:05.051 --> 03:41:05.411]  Go ahead.
[03:41:07.165 --> 03:41:09.806]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:41:09.806 --> 03:41:12.967]  You kind of touched on, I was going to ask about the chemtrails.
[03:41:12.967 --> 03:41:22.910]  I live here in Indiana, Indianapolis, and a day doesn't go by that I don't see dozens and dozens of chemtrails crisscrossing.
[03:41:22.910 --> 03:41:27.192]  Do you know if those are military airplanes or commercial airplanes?
[03:41:28.300 --> 03:41:29.942]  Some of all of the above.
[03:41:29.942 --> 03:41:30.442]  All of the above?
[03:41:30.442 --> 03:41:36.708]  So, I mean, I was thinking about, you know, trying to grow some of my own food, but with that stuff being sprayed in the sky, it probably makes more sense to try to grow stuff indoors.
[03:41:50.138 --> 03:41:52.219]  You put it in the greenhouse.
[03:41:52.219 --> 03:41:55.462]  Do intensive farming indoors.
[03:41:55.462 --> 03:42:05.069]  Create a community greenhouse for your neighbors if you're not too far out in the country to have neighbors.
[03:42:05.069 --> 03:42:10.934]  Do not assume that just because the sun is shining, your food is safe.
[03:42:10.934 --> 03:42:17.299]  And if you live in a farming area, your food is contaminated with genetically modified material.
[03:42:19.550 --> 03:42:20.971]  Whether you know it or not.
[03:42:20.971 --> 03:42:21.952]  It blows around.
[03:42:21.952 --> 03:42:24.734]  I mean, let's explain.
[03:42:24.734 --> 03:42:36.043]  Even the organic crops are having the same species but a different variety blow in and then plants aren't like a person where you've got one dad and one mom.
[03:42:36.043 --> 03:42:38.745]  Doctor, do you want to explain that briefly?
[03:42:38.745 --> 03:42:41.287]  That plants take on the genetics of even other species?
[03:42:42.429 --> 03:42:47.252]  I was about to talk about this when we got to the call.
[03:42:47.252 --> 03:42:54.717]  Even organic food is allowed in the United States to have 10% genetically modified contamination.
[03:42:54.717 --> 03:42:59.900]  In the rest of the world, it's either 0.9% or 1%, depending on the country.
[03:42:59.900 --> 03:43:08.486]  So we're talking about one-tenth of the material that you eat when you're eating organic food being contaminated and still called organic.
[03:43:09.976 --> 03:43:13.978]  It is absolutely essential that you start growing your own food.
[03:43:13.978 --> 03:43:22.382]  Plants get contaminated not only by the same species as we used to think, but also by other species.
[03:43:22.382 --> 03:43:24.363]  The genetic material mixes.
[03:43:24.363 --> 03:43:28.905]  The results are absolutely not in your favor.
[03:43:28.905 --> 03:43:29.946]  Alright, Toby, gotta jump.
[03:43:29.946 --> 03:43:31.066]  Robert in Canada, go ahead.
[03:43:31.066 --> 03:43:32.647]  I'm trying to go quick with these calls here.
[03:43:32.647 --> 03:43:33.287]  Robert, go ahead.
[03:43:33.287 --> 03:43:34.128]  You're on the air with our guest.
[03:43:35.603 --> 03:43:36.884]  Yeah, I'm in Toronto.
[03:43:36.884 --> 03:43:38.084]  I'd like... This is a comment.
[03:43:38.084 --> 03:43:40.545]  It's an orthomolecular comment.
[03:43:40.545 --> 03:43:57.491]  Back in the 80s, and the doctor will understand this, I had an immune system collapse and I was going to die, according to my doctor of internal medicine, of some sort of lymphoma.
[03:43:57.491 --> 03:44:01.132]  The Epstein-Barr and other viruses had activated and it was going chronic.
[03:44:01.132 --> 03:44:03.753]  I contacted the Palo Alto Institute in California.
[03:44:04.730 --> 03:44:12.155]  I talked with Pauling's people, Linus Pauling, who, by the way, had 480 honorary PhDs and two Nobel Prizes.
[03:44:12.155 --> 03:44:23.943]  Correspondingly, they put me on to Cathcart, Dr. Cathcart in Philadelphia, and they said if you take vitamin C at the appropriate doses three times a day, what will happen is you'll kill the virus.
[03:44:23.943 --> 03:44:29.027]  Their claim was any virus, any acute virus, will be killed by vitamin C if it's used properly.
[03:44:29.027 --> 03:44:32.109]  Now that's what happened.
[03:44:32.109 --> 03:44:33.970]  And this is the issue now with the Codex.
[03:44:34.781 --> 03:44:48.348]  I've been taking 25 grams of C for 20, 22, 23 years, and if they cut off the supply of C, I've been told by physicians I'm in deep trouble.
[03:44:48.348 --> 03:44:50.609]  I contacted them... I have some pieces for you.
[03:44:50.609 --> 03:44:58.773]  I've practiced orthomolecular medicine for many, many years, and what you say is right, although most people can't handle, the GI tract can't handle.
[03:44:59.538 --> 03:45:04.782]  No, it can only take one gram.
[03:45:04.782 --> 03:45:08.124]  I can take 20 or more.
[03:45:08.124 --> 03:45:10.706]  There's another product which we recommend.
[03:45:10.706 --> 03:45:25.517]  It's nano silver and we, the Natural Solutions Foundation, recommend a particular source which you can find if you go to our website healthfreedomusa.org.
[03:45:25.517 --> 03:45:27.158]  Nano silver will kill
[03:45:27.928 --> 03:45:41.157]  All pathogens against which it's been tested, currently 635 of them, including the H5N1 virus, which we believe to have been... Modified, yeah.
[03:45:41.157 --> 03:45:49.063]  And the HIV-supposed causal virus.
[03:45:49.063 --> 03:45:52.485]  We're talking about an immensely important, completely safe,
[03:45:53.018 --> 03:45:56.541]  And totally, um, universally applicable.
[03:45:56.541 --> 03:45:59.383]  And that's why they're trying to restrict that, right here in Texas.
[03:45:59.383 --> 03:46:01.764]  You see, that's essentially my comment.
[03:46:01.764 --> 03:46:02.325]  Hello?
[03:46:02.325 --> 03:46:05.287]  Yeah, they're trying to kill you, sir.
[03:46:05.287 --> 03:46:09.410]  Essentially, my comment is about the suppression of orthomolecular solutions.
[03:46:09.410 --> 03:46:11.431]  In my case, it worked.
[03:46:11.431 --> 03:46:19.197]  The doctor who in fact supported me in this particular, um, endeavor, uh, was quite severely chastised.
[03:46:20.772 --> 03:46:21.793]  Thank you.
[03:46:21.793 --> 03:46:22.854]  There is a war against
[03:46:44.247 --> 03:46:54.936]  Natural medicine, but there's also war against the people who are bringing you natural medicine, against physicians and non-physicians who are sharing this information and using these techniques.
[03:46:54.936 --> 03:46:57.138]  An absolute war against them.
[03:46:57.138 --> 03:47:00.241]  And the reason is because they work.
[03:47:00.241 --> 03:47:12.431]  They work just like they work for you, they work for me, they work for Dr. Arema, they work for people who use them, and they, the people who are in this genocidal approach,
[03:47:12.870 --> 03:47:17.795]  Do not want something that, uh, like that that works.
[03:47:17.795 --> 03:47:20.197]  They would much rather give you GMO.
[03:47:20.197 --> 03:47:21.899]  They'd much rather give you drugs.
[03:47:21.899 --> 03:47:23.100]  Stay there, stay there, stay there.
[03:47:23.100 --> 03:47:23.461]  Gotta break.
[03:47:23.461 --> 03:47:23.801]  Here we go.
[03:47:23.801 --> 03:47:24.922]  Final segment.
[03:47:24.922 --> 03:47:25.263]  Attention.
[03:47:25.263 --> 03:47:25.983]  Skip this break, too.
[03:47:27.349 --> 03:47:28.489]  We're on internet only.
[03:47:28.489 --> 03:47:30.630]  I appreciate your call, Robert.
[03:47:30.630 --> 03:47:37.533]  I'm going to talk to Sherry and Dan just for internet only, but that's tens of thousands live right now and hundreds of thousands within a day and millions within weeks.
[03:47:37.533 --> 03:47:39.213]  That's the exponential power of the web.
[03:47:39.213 --> 03:47:41.014]  That's why they're now moving.
[03:47:41.014 --> 03:47:43.435]  I've got to do a whole show on this to attack the web.
[03:47:43.435 --> 03:47:44.535]  They're openly announcing it.
[03:47:44.535 --> 03:47:46.116]  They're shutting it down all over the place.
[03:47:46.756 --> 03:47:49.358]  Definitely things are moving quicker than I'd even thought.
[03:47:49.358 --> 03:47:52.000]  And I don't like that because I want more time to beat these people.
[03:47:52.000 --> 03:47:56.063]  But let's take a few final calls and we'll come back live on air and say bye to our guest.
[03:47:56.063 --> 03:48:02.208]  And let's not wait a year before we have General Stubblebine and Dr. Labo back on the show.
[03:48:02.208 --> 03:48:05.791]  Let's go ahead and go to Sherry in Texas.
[03:48:05.791 --> 03:48:07.252]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[03:48:07.252 --> 03:48:09.133]  Hi, hi Alex.
[03:48:10.327 --> 03:48:17.713]  I just had a question about chemtrails and their effect on humans.
[03:48:17.713 --> 03:48:24.119]  I have a family member who has stage 3 breast cancer and she believes in chemtrails, finally.
[03:48:24.119 --> 03:48:30.404]  I finally got pictures of them, video of them, showed them to her and said, these are not contrails, Mom.
[03:48:30.404 --> 03:48:32.466]  And, well, there you go.
[03:48:32.466 --> 03:48:36.489]  But she basically doesn't think that they're affecting anything.
[03:48:41.978 --> 03:48:43.259]  Well, let me just be clear.
[03:48:43.259 --> 03:48:45.841]  The chemtrail phenomenon, it's a cocktail.
[03:48:45.841 --> 03:48:50.566]  There's a bunch of different operations going on, and it's highly classified.
[03:48:50.566 --> 03:48:56.531]  They're only admitting the weather modification portion of them, and so we don't know.
[03:48:56.531 --> 03:48:57.572]  We need more research.
[03:48:57.572 --> 03:48:58.633]  But I know this.
[03:48:58.633 --> 03:48:58.893]  Until 1996,
[03:49:00.034 --> 03:49:01.515]  Trails were up there.
[03:49:01.515 --> 03:49:03.416]  They formed at 30,000 feet or higher.
[03:49:03.416 --> 03:49:05.236]  They were there for 30 seconds a minute.
[03:49:05.236 --> 03:49:08.458]  Now they're there for two hours while I'm in the garden.
[03:49:08.458 --> 03:49:11.359]  And then they start floating down.
[03:49:11.359 --> 03:49:13.200]  But go ahead, Doctor.
[03:49:13.200 --> 03:49:28.407]  Well, what I was going to say is if you go to our, if you Google Morgellons, M-O-R-G-E-L-L-O-N-S apostrophe, G-E-L-L-O-N apostrophe S,
[03:49:28.962 --> 03:49:29.602]  Yes, we're good.
[03:49:52.892 --> 03:49:53.873]  Well, listen, we're out of time.
[03:49:53.873 --> 03:49:54.653]  Thank you so much, Sherry.
[03:49:54.653 --> 03:49:56.134]  I'm going to try to cram Dan in for the full audience.
[03:50:18.615 --> 03:50:23.605]  The government is taking foster children and testing pesticides on them until they die.
[03:50:23.605 --> 03:50:24.887]  New York Daily News.
[03:50:24.887 --> 03:50:25.529]  Believe!
[03:50:25.529 --> 03:50:27.112]  The people running things are evil.
[03:50:27.112 --> 03:50:27.472]  Here we go.
[03:50:37.571 --> 03:50:42.353]  All right, real fast, because I'm going to let my guests go, and I appreciate them joining us today.
[03:50:42.353 --> 03:50:43.674]  I hope to have them back very soon.
[03:50:43.674 --> 03:50:49.477]  Dan in Illinois, final caller for General Stubblebine, Major General Stubblebine, and Dr. Labo.
[03:50:49.477 --> 03:50:49.837]  Go ahead.
[03:50:49.837 --> 03:50:51.938]  Hey, Alex, I respect your show.
[03:50:51.938 --> 03:50:53.639]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:50:53.639 --> 03:51:02.184]  Really quickly, I want to say my stepfather, I live here in Illinois, and he works in the agriculture business, and he does a lot of work with chemicals and fields.
[03:51:02.184 --> 03:51:02.724]  That's how he's
[03:51:03.621 --> 03:51:04.082]  I don't know.
[03:51:18.639 --> 03:51:34.893]  And the thing is, I want to bring it up to him, and I want to talk to him about it, but I don't want to hurt his pride, because, you know, that's the job in the industry that he's in, and maybe what's the best way that I could go about... I would give him studies about how it's sterilizing rats, and say that, you know, that the studies show that with the same thing to humans.
[03:51:34.893 --> 03:51:38.196]  I mean, do you want to be involved in something that's hurting people?
[03:51:38.196 --> 03:51:40.838]  Because he's compartmentalized, and I would send him
[03:51:41.498 --> 03:51:42.899]  To Infowars.com.
[03:51:42.899 --> 03:51:47.821]  I would send him to the website of our guest today.
[03:51:47.821 --> 03:51:51.482]  I mean, there's a lot of things that you can do like that.
[03:51:51.482 --> 03:51:53.223]  Can I add something real quick?
[03:51:53.223 --> 03:51:55.283]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:51:55.283 --> 03:52:08.288]  I would suggest you tell him that you were listening to the show and you heard General Stubblebine, a man with a career of great luster, who realized that the forces that he was serving throughout his career
[03:52:10.239 --> 03:52:11.160]  We're good to go.
[03:52:27.279 --> 03:52:28.840]  Your dad can do the same.
[03:52:28.840 --> 03:52:41.262]  Absolutely, and I'm sorry to say to Dan and Dr. Labo and General Stubblebine that we are just flat out of time, but I want to thank you both for spending time with us today, and I want everybody to visit the website healthfreedomusa.org.
[03:52:41.262 --> 03:52:43.702]  We'll also put it up on the screen.
[03:52:43.702 --> 03:52:46.382]  Absolutely, General Stubblebine was compartmentalized.
[03:52:46.382 --> 03:52:47.623]  I was compartmentalized.
[03:52:47.623 --> 03:52:51.263]  We all are in life, and the claims we're making are very serious.
[03:52:51.263 --> 03:52:52.664]  You better check them out, folks.
[03:52:52.664 --> 03:52:55.064]  General Stubblebine, Dr. Labo, thank you for joining us.
[03:52:56.758 --> 03:52:58.821]  Thank you very, very much.
[03:52:58.821 --> 03:52:59.882]  Keep up the good work.
[03:52:59.882 --> 03:53:00.503]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:53:14.437 --> 03:53:24.943]  We also need support at InfoWars.com and I hope you give the gift of information this holiday season so check out the video and bookstore there at InfoWars.com or get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[03:53:24.943 --> 03:53:34.669]  Some of the sponsors that tie into all of this are eFoodsDirect, eFoodsDirect.com, the best storable foods company out there at the best price that I have personally found.
[03:53:34.669 --> 03:53:36.070]  High quality, non-GMO,
[03:53:36.830 --> 03:53:38.612]  800-409-5633.
[03:53:38.612 --> 03:53:40.755]  The most inexpensive, the highest quality.
[03:53:40.755 --> 03:53:41.315]  800-409-5633.
[03:53:41.315 --> 03:53:47.322]  You can see them up on screen at PrisonPlanet.tv, their website.
[03:53:47.322 --> 03:53:50.746]  E, the letter E, foodsdirect.com, efoodsdirect.com.
[03:53:52.188 --> 03:53:52.588]  We're good to go.
[03:54:08.659 --> 03:54:12.122]  Really, uh, amazed at the listeners, but it's a great product.
[03:54:12.122 --> 03:54:16.225]  I mean, why wouldn't they be amazed that, you know, masses of people are calling and getting it?
[03:54:16.225 --> 03:54:18.227]  It's an atmospheric water generator for the home.
[03:54:18.227 --> 03:54:21.169]  Pays for itself in one year if you buy your water from the store.
[03:54:21.169 --> 03:54:23.791]  Great tasting, pure H2O, exactly the way nature makes it.
[03:54:23.791 --> 03:54:25.712]  No chemicals, pollutants, or toxins.
[03:54:25.712 --> 03:54:26.493]  Neutral pH.
[03:54:26.493 --> 03:54:28.134]  Then goes through five filters inside.
[03:54:30.477 --> 03:54:34.201]  666-585-4044, 866-585-4044.
[03:54:34.201 --> 03:54:38.547]  Call and get a brochure, go to the website, check out all their products, they've got a bunch of other stuff.
[03:54:38.547 --> 03:54:45.095]  Acolablue.com grabs the water out of the air, they post it through five filters, and it is just
[03:54:46.096 --> 03:54:47.297]  Awesome, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:54:47.297 --> 03:54:50.398]  These things are awesome.
[03:54:50.398 --> 03:54:51.959]  866-585-4044 or callabaloo.com.
[03:54:51.959 --> 03:54:53.500]  Alright, we are out of time.
[03:54:53.500 --> 03:54:57.002]  Rebroadcast with all the important guests we had on today.
[03:54:57.002 --> 03:55:00.964]  Starts right now at InfoWars.com with Bob Chapman and others.
[03:55:00.964 --> 03:55:02.225]  So be sure and stay with us.
[03:55:02.225 --> 03:55:04.246]  And I had a JAG officer on right now.
