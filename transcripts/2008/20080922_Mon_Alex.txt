[00:00:00.129 --> 00:00:00.890]  Federal agents!
[00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:01.410]  We are armed!
[00:00:26.044 --> 00:00:32.773]  Well, our guest is Roger D. Masters, Department of Government, Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire.
[00:00:32.793 --> 00:00:43.486]  He's a research professor at Dartmouth College, a Nelson A. Rockefeller professor of government, emeritus at Dartmouth College, and president of the Foundation for Neuroscience and Society.
[00:00:44.671 --> 00:00:48.853]  And if I went over his bio, it would take a long time to cover it.
[00:00:49.473 --> 00:00:52.195]  After undergraduate study at Harvard, B.A.
[00:00:52.215 --> 00:01:03.080]  55, and service in the Army, Masher has completed graduate work in political philosophy at the University of Chicago, where he wrote his doctoral dissertation under the direction of Leo Strauss and Joseph Cropsey.
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.581]  And that's Leo Strauss, the big neocon kingpin.
[00:01:07.081 --> 00:01:13.983]  The central theme of Master's work is the philosophical and scientific exploration of the role of human nature in political and social behavior.
[00:01:14.564 --> 00:01:20.866]  Now, there's so much about this guy, his bio is about a hundred pages long, that for the next hour we have him.
[00:01:21.426 --> 00:01:22.906]  I just want to let him introduce himself.
[00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:27.842]  You know, tell you the stuff about him he thinks you should know.
[00:01:27.882 --> 00:01:37.225]  And then I want to get into one of his big areas of research and in documenting is the fact that when they started putting fluoride and different derivatives of it in the water supply.
[00:01:38.065 --> 00:01:38.985]  And why they do that.
[00:01:39.585 --> 00:01:41.346]  And what the facts are you can go check for yourselves.
[00:01:41.906 --> 00:01:50.209]  And of course his work ties into why is lawn fertilizer different than crop fertilizer?
[00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:54.190]  Well, why do they say with lawn fertilizer don't put it on crops or your garden?
[00:01:55.532 --> 00:01:56.874]  Because it's toxic waste.
[00:01:57.656 --> 00:01:59.118]  It's the same thing with depleted uranium.
[00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.048]  They've got all these thousands and tens of thousands, more than that, millions of tons of it.
[00:02:05.528 --> 00:02:06.530]  They've got to put it somewhere.
[00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.313]  It's very poisonous and radioactive.
[00:02:08.593 --> 00:02:09.635]  So they put it into weapons.
[00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:11.910]  It's hiding it in plain view.
[00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:23.820]  And so we will discuss this today, because you see, fluoride is only a catchphrase or an overall name that they were able to pass laws through Congress for.
[00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:31.486]  It's what goes along with what you know as fluoride in the water, and that's what he is an expert on, among other things.
[00:02:31.967 --> 00:02:37.111]  And so we're very honored to have Roger D. Masters on with us today.
[00:02:37.351 --> 00:02:38.452]  Thanks for coming on, Professor.
[00:02:39.215 --> 00:02:39.975]  It's my pleasure.
[00:02:40.275 --> 00:02:41.655]  Thank you very much for inviting me.
[00:02:41.695 --> 00:02:42.636]  I appreciate it a great deal.
[00:02:43.116 --> 00:02:43.496]  You bet.
[00:02:43.516 --> 00:02:48.737]  How did somebody who was under Leo Strauss get into the work of trying to warn people about fluoride in the water?
[00:02:49.377 --> 00:03:04.600]  Well, Strauss was an amazing thinker, and he wanted us to read a great book to try and figure out what that writer, whether it was Rousseau or Plato or whoever, what he was really trying to say that might be true.
[00:03:05.925 --> 00:03:13.808]  The whole point about Western civilization is that we're a civilization that uses science to try to find out what is nature and human nature.
[00:03:13.828 --> 00:03:14.928]  What's the truth about it?
[00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:32.115]  And after a certain time, I realized that I was teaching all these old books like Plato or so, and that sometimes modern biology or modern science was showing that what they were saying in these books was false.
[00:03:33.933 --> 00:03:42.855]  And I thought, gee, you know, I've got to tell people that this book, you know, John Locke saying that the brain is a blank slate.
[00:03:42.955 --> 00:03:46.036]  Well, Gary, your brain isn't a blank slate.
[00:03:46.076 --> 00:03:49.217]  It's a much more complicated piece of meat than that.
[00:03:49.297 --> 00:03:50.837]  Gee, I've got to explain that's wrong.
[00:03:51.878 --> 00:03:56.419]  Or, Rousseau says, humans were originally individuals running around all alone in the state of nature.
[00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:59.000]  And then I read about the chimpanzees, and oh, they're not like that.
[00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.520]  Oh, I've got to explain he was wrong.
[00:04:01.827 --> 00:04:05.548]  And so I've been working on that for a long time and one thing leads to another.
[00:04:07.148 --> 00:04:12.270]  How did you get into research on, at the end of the Manhattan Project, dumping it in the water supply?
[00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:20.872]  I mean, I want to start at the beginning and walk through that, but first tell us what in your research led you to the mass chemical poisoning of the population?
[00:04:21.852 --> 00:04:30.514]  What happened was I started thinking in just general terms about biology and human nature and I went to a conference
[00:04:31.624 --> 00:04:45.669]  And I heard a retired oil executive named Brett Hodges from California give a presentation on how violent criminals have high levels of either lead or manganese in their blood.
[00:04:47.549 --> 00:05:00.634]  And this was very interesting to me, that we were putting pollution in the environment, never so lead toys are bad, you know, so a pollution is bad, but they don't talk about how it might change the chemistry of your brain.
[00:05:01.929 --> 00:05:03.069]  And so I decided to study that.
[00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:10.753]  Well that's the old saying of mad as a hatter because in the dying process they were using mercury and lead and things and so you'd be mad as a hatter.
[00:05:11.233 --> 00:05:12.113]  Oh sure, sure.
[00:05:12.593 --> 00:05:25.959]  And besides, what seems to have happened is that I mentioned this idea of a blank slate because there's this whole idea that everything we do is stuff we learn and there's no reason for understanding biology because it's deterministic or something.
[00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:30.080]  When really you would say, what, 80% is nature instead of nurture?
[00:05:31.874 --> 00:05:36.717]  Well, I think that we ought to start to forget that and look at the facts.
[00:05:38.678 --> 00:05:52.908]  One of the things that Mr. Strauss taught us, he advised me when I finished my work, is always teach as if there's a silent student in class who knows more than you do.
[00:05:53.228 --> 00:06:00.753]  He wasn't an ideologist himself, some of his students were, but if you imagine that, I have to imagine that there are some of your listeners
[00:06:01.533 --> 00:06:02.574]  We're going to know more than I do.
[00:06:03.954 --> 00:06:06.396]  And if I make mistakes, I want them to correct me.
[00:06:07.616 --> 00:06:24.766]  Because I think what makes our civilization special is this possibility of an open-minded study, so that if the government says, oh, it's a great thing to fluoridate water, and I come across the discovery, wait a second, what counts is which chemical you use,
[00:06:26.221 --> 00:06:31.383]  And we've got to re-look at that, and not just use one word, but say, wait a second, what are we actually doing?
[00:06:31.403 --> 00:06:32.284]  What's the science of it?
[00:06:32.364 --> 00:06:49.811]  So you're talking about kind of the private, individual, mass consciousness, or private intelligence agency, where we all integrate our own research, and then almost have our own private research going on, which then brings it all to a higher level.
[00:06:50.511 --> 00:06:54.573]  So let's get to the point when you bump in... Let me explain how I got into this.
[00:06:55.188 --> 00:07:04.875]  That is, I started to look at pollution with lead and manganese, and I had to figure out, well, what does lead do to the brain?
[00:07:06.015 --> 00:07:20.005]  Now, lead has an effect on a particular chemical in the brain, a neurotransmitter called dopamine, and if you have a disturbed... Dopamine is the chemical that works all the centers of your brain,
[00:07:20.578 --> 00:07:22.800]  They're involved in making judgments.
[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:27.263]  It controls impulsiveness until you decide what's a good thing to do.
[00:07:28.664 --> 00:07:35.089]  And so, I realized that there was a science about this that Americans had to know about.
[00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:49.499]  Because if Americans don't know why lead is bad, or why manganese is bad, and they don't know that pollution means that a company says, oh, it's too expensive to clean up this pollution.
[00:07:50.919 --> 00:07:52.540]  But they're poisoning the kids!
[00:07:54.802 --> 00:07:57.144]  So I said, well, how is it poisoning the kids?
[00:07:58.265 --> 00:07:59.686]  And so I began to do studies.
[00:07:59.726 --> 00:08:00.527]  A simple study.
[00:08:01.988 --> 00:08:05.471]  There are some counties in the United States where the EPA reports there's lead pollution.
[00:08:06.692 --> 00:08:08.953]  And other counties where they report there's manganese pollution.
[00:08:10.255 --> 00:08:16.720]  And I said, well, what kind of behavior is connected with lead pollution that we can measure?
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.502]  Well, I remember, oh, Brett Hodges said violent crime, right?
[00:08:20.182 --> 00:08:21.703]  Well, we've got good data on violent crime.
[00:08:21.723 --> 00:08:23.725]  You know, we keep track of how many people kill other people.
[00:08:23.845 --> 00:08:31.050]  And so you can take the data on where areas have more lead contamination, and then you look at the areas where they have crime statistics, and voila!
[00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:33.632]  They lay over each other quite nicely, don't they?
[00:08:34.313 --> 00:08:34.913]  Absolutely.
[00:08:35.634 --> 00:08:41.258]  And to give you one example of that, which is just fantastic, we did something that was right when we banned leaded gasoline.
[00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:47.323]  Because when we banned leaded gasoline, it had the effect of reducing the crime rate.
[00:08:48.303 --> 00:08:49.084]  But not right away.
[00:08:49.611 --> 00:08:50.371]  Crime rate dropped in 1991.
[00:08:50.812 --> 00:08:56.814]  It was when the first generation of kids whose mothers weren't exposed to lead when they were pregnant.
[00:08:59.276 --> 00:09:03.357]  And they weren't exposed anymore, so much, because there was no more leaded gas.
[00:09:03.858 --> 00:09:08.880]  And that first generation, when they got to be 17 or 18, their criminal behavior just dropped way off.
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:13.982]  And for those that don't know, in the 70s and 80s, it was just liquor store robberies, murder.
[00:09:14.042 --> 00:09:15.523]  The murder rate was a lot higher.
[00:09:15.543 --> 00:09:16.804]  I mean, it was really dangerous.
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:18.480]  Absolutely.
[00:09:18.541 --> 00:09:20.782]  And the cars were driving around shooting lead out the back.
[00:09:21.322 --> 00:09:22.603]  That's right.
[00:09:22.723 --> 00:09:25.544]  Which makes you violent in thousands of studies.
[00:09:25.564 --> 00:09:28.025]  Sure, but I discovered there are lots of other things.
[00:09:28.045 --> 00:09:47.195]  For instance, if you live in a community with a lot of old housing, since lead paint is on both the inside and outside of the old housing, people point out that kids find the taste of lead paint sweet, so they're more likely that it's a chip of paint, actually, and something to eat it.
[00:09:47.881 --> 00:10:07.967]  But it's also true that, for instance, in the 9th Ward in New Orleans, which was reputed to be terribly violent, let's defer to that, there's a scientist down there who did some work and he found out that the big source of lead in the kids down there in the 9th Ward was the grass strip between the sidewalk and the street.
[00:10:08.867 --> 00:10:13.028]  If the lead gas came out of those cars back before lead gas was banned,
[00:10:14.083 --> 00:10:16.685]  As particles in the atmosphere, they're dropped in the ground, and it's inert.
[00:10:16.705 --> 00:10:17.686]  It just stays there forever.
[00:10:17.826 --> 00:10:29.254]  So it gets in the grass, and the grass is wet one day, and the kid's running down the street, and he falls down, and they put his hand in the grass, and the next thing, he licks his hand, and before you know it, he's got the lead in his body.
[00:10:30.555 --> 00:10:40.862]  You have to realize that there are many ways you can drive, as I put it, there's many ways to drive from Boston to Chicago, and there's many ways that a toxic chemical can get into kids.
[00:10:42.941 --> 00:10:47.483]  If we get at this, we can cut down the cost of two things.
[00:10:48.323 --> 00:10:49.584]  Three things, actually, that are important.
[00:10:49.604 --> 00:10:51.304]  First, learning disabilities.
[00:10:51.964 --> 00:10:55.766]  Special Ed is about $15,000 a year per kid, on some estimates.
[00:10:56.806 --> 00:11:01.928]  I got evidence that these toxic chemicals increase the rates of learning disabilities.
[00:11:02.489 --> 00:11:04.229]  Well, obviously, let me stop you.
[00:11:04.269 --> 00:11:08.451]  I mean, lead, arsenic, mercury, fluoride.
[00:11:09.608 --> 00:11:13.472]  Professor, and of course we should add, you've won a lot of international awards for your research.
[00:11:13.512 --> 00:11:14.092]  Groundbreaking.
[00:11:14.573 --> 00:11:17.455]  And now I'm just accepted, you know, basically as fact because it is.
[00:11:18.016 --> 00:11:23.922]  But they knew 200 years ago that lead and mercury had all sorts of problems, made you go insane.
[00:11:24.382 --> 00:11:27.845]  You know, they knew 100 years ago what fluoride did.
[00:11:27.865 --> 00:11:31.329]  I mean, that's the University of Texas studies and German studies from 80, 90, 100 years ago.
[00:11:33.999 --> 00:11:44.969]  So, I mean, here you are discovering that this really is increasing crime and anti-social behavior and a dumbing down, but now let's look at why they decided to put it in the water.
[00:11:44.989 --> 00:11:50.814]  Well, first of all, I want to raise a question for you with what you just said.
[00:11:52.015 --> 00:11:58.300]  It's not so clear that fluoride itself is always the problem.
[00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:04.852]  I bet you know somebody who uses toothpaste with sodium fluoride in it.
[00:12:05.492 --> 00:12:08.294]  Yes.
[00:12:08.714 --> 00:12:12.316]  You have to have an awful lot of fluoride to cause a problem.
[00:12:12.396 --> 00:12:17.178]  Obviously if you have too much of anything, get above a certain level, it's really bad news.
[00:12:17.571 --> 00:12:19.032]  Well, see, that's the thing, Professor.
[00:12:19.092 --> 00:12:28.797]  People don't know that the word fluoride is a coverall for dumping hundreds of things in the water, so maybe we should get to that and then break down the history of it, but go ahead.
[00:12:29.097 --> 00:12:42.385]  Alright, well, look, the main thing is that in putting fluoride in the water, instead of sodium fluoride, most of it, over 90% of it, uses one of two chemicals.
[00:12:42.865 --> 00:12:44.906]  Either something called fluorosilicic acid,
[00:12:45.646 --> 00:12:46.466]  We're good to go.
[00:13:14.466 --> 00:13:14.866]  I think so.
[00:13:40.393 --> 00:13:45.234]  The chemist I work with, everything in this is done with a chemist named Mark J. Copeland.
[00:13:45.314 --> 00:13:50.676]  I really owe him a great deal because he's the one who got me started on looking at fluoride compounds.
[00:13:51.716 --> 00:14:03.599]  He calls it an oligomer of silicic acid, which is a fancy word for just saying there's a chemical there that's left over after you put the silico fluoride into the water.
[00:14:04.359 --> 00:14:06.660]  And so the real question is why do we put them in the water?
[00:14:08.493 --> 00:14:10.055]  And so I'm going to ask you a question.
[00:14:10.135 --> 00:14:21.145]  What agency of the federal government do you think decided to design the idea and got people to start putting a fluoride compound, not fluoride, it's a fluoride compound, in water supply?
[00:14:21.465 --> 00:14:33.556]  The Department of Energy, after they had all these millions of tons of toxic waste piled up and they had some spills in Tennessee and other places that
[00:14:34.673 --> 00:14:35.634]  Killed some of the rivers.
[00:14:36.334 --> 00:14:37.215]  Actually, it was before that.
[00:14:38.075 --> 00:14:44.339]  Well, I know that it was the Department of Energy that went around all the cities and lobbied everybody, but, I mean, go ahead, give us the history, Professor.
[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:48.622]  The history goes back to World War II.
[00:14:50.363 --> 00:14:57.048]  Yeah, the Manhattan Project, but I'm saying after... Actually, it goes back before that, because... Okay.
[00:14:57.068 --> 00:14:58.208]  Well, tell us the whole history, then.
[00:14:58.248 --> 00:14:59.069]  That's why we've got you here.
[00:14:59.109 --> 00:15:00.350]  You're the expert on this.
[00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:03.552]  Well, the history begins, actually,
[00:15:04.575 --> 00:15:11.818]  With Einstein coming to the United States and writing that letter to Roosevelt about the possibility of making a bomb that would make a huge explosion.
[00:15:11.838 --> 00:15:17.580]  You know, Einstein wrote Roosevelt a letter about the possibility of having a nuclear bomb.
[00:15:19.041 --> 00:15:22.782]  Then the Germans took over Czechoslovakia, called the Anschluss.
[00:15:23.843 --> 00:15:30.025]  That was one of the things that triggered World War II, but when the Nazis went into Czechoslovakia, why'd they pick that place?
[00:15:30.885 --> 00:15:32.106]  They occupied the place
[00:15:33.001 --> 00:15:35.002]  With the best uranium in Europe.
[00:15:36.622 --> 00:15:46.765]  Now, one thing we forget is that when Einstein came to the United States as a brilliant physicist, there are other brilliant physicists who stayed in Germany.
[00:15:47.265 --> 00:15:48.226]  Like Max Planck!
[00:15:49.186 --> 00:15:52.927]  Yeah, and Hitler began a nuclear weapons project.
[00:15:54.788 --> 00:16:01.950]  Now, in fact, we know two things about that that's worth mentioning, because I want the audience to have in mind that
[00:16:03.069 --> 00:16:05.230]  This is all secret during World War II.
[00:16:06.451 --> 00:16:11.575]  This question of whether Hitler had the bomb, whether we didn't want anybody to know we were working on a bomb.
[00:16:11.875 --> 00:16:12.675]  Well, he really did.
[00:16:12.695 --> 00:16:18.259]  We only had enough to test one at the end of the... near the end of the war, they did that secret deal.
[00:16:18.599 --> 00:16:25.064]  I'm sure you know about this, Professor, with the U-boat trading in exchange for safety in South America.
[00:16:25.084 --> 00:16:29.887]  Sure, but the question is, first of all,
[00:16:33.295 --> 00:17:00.576]  What is not generally known is that there's a question of why Hitler didn't make more progress with the Great Physicist, and there's a rumor, it's never been proved, we have no evidence for it, it's a guess, that some nuclear physicists, and perhaps the Great Physicist, Heisenberg, arranged for the experiments to fail because they didn't want Hitler to have
[00:17:02.096 --> 00:17:09.902]  Well, the one thing we do know is that Hitler had a huge supply of uranium that he had separated.
[00:17:09.922 --> 00:17:12.865]  You have to separate uranium from other elements in rock.
[00:17:12.885 --> 00:17:14.506]  It's a little difficult to enrich it.
[00:17:14.626 --> 00:17:17.669]  You know, all this stuff we hear about these centrifuges now.
[00:17:17.709 --> 00:17:21.772]  You have to do something to make the uranium into a state where it can cause a bomb.
[00:17:22.793 --> 00:17:31.080]  And Hitler put his uranium in a place in Norway called Tenemunde, where he put the uranium in something called heavy water, which was
[00:17:32.074 --> 00:17:34.375]  Which absorbs radiation, so it couldn't explode.
[00:17:35.036 --> 00:17:38.157]  They weren't sure what to do with their uranium, so it wouldn't have an accident.
[00:17:38.717 --> 00:17:42.559]  And it didn't want to be in Germany, because they were afraid it would vomit, so they put it in Norway.
[00:17:42.959 --> 00:17:43.940]  And so they sent in U.S.
[00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:47.341]  forces that followed it when it went across the lake on the barge and sunk it.
[00:17:48.062 --> 00:17:48.542]  That's right.
[00:17:48.562 --> 00:17:53.024]  So, we destroyed his uranium, and that set that whole thing way back.
[00:17:54.685 --> 00:17:58.507]  Hitler himself was apparently not as good as there are some reports.
[00:17:59.522 --> 00:18:03.304]  Do you have doubts about the stability of the dollar or your own financial future?
[00:18:03.425 --> 00:18:05.766]  Is a dismal growth rate or rapid inflation affecting the bottom line?
[00:18:05.786 --> 00:18:07.587]  It is uranium and that set that whole thing way back.
[00:18:07.607 --> 00:18:09.088]  Hitler himself was apparently not as
[00:18:33.806 --> 00:18:43.335]  Well, we've seen the German maps on what their A-bomb is going to do to Manhattan, but it was so late in the war they decided the U.S.
[00:18:43.355 --> 00:18:45.957]  would annihilate them with conventional weapons, so they made a deal.
[00:18:47.691 --> 00:18:51.473]  Do you have doubts about the stability of the dollar or your own financial future?
[00:18:51.873 --> 00:18:56.615]  Is a dismal growth rate or rapid inflation affecting the bottom line of your retirement savings account?
[00:18:56.875 --> 00:19:01.917]  Do you worry about uncontrollable economic events which could suddenly wipe out some or all of your hard-earned savings?
[00:19:02.197 --> 00:19:04.118]  You can turn adversity into opportunity.
[00:19:04.298 --> 00:19:12.724]  Individual retirement accounts and most 401Ks, 403Bs, SEFs and other retirement plans can be rolled over into self-directed accounts using gold and silver.
[00:19:12.784 --> 00:19:17.407]  There are definitely some do's and don'ts with this rollover process and that's where Midas Resources comes in.
[00:19:17.767 --> 00:19:23.471]  Call us at 1-866-323-5665 and we can help you with this process.
[00:19:23.971 --> 00:19:28.874]  History has shown that metals will maintain your buying power even if other financial assets are failing.
[00:19:29.435 --> 00:19:33.878]  It's not a question of if you'll need precious metals in your portfolio, it's a question of when.
[00:19:34.358 --> 00:19:39.403]  So whether you're planning for an economic rainy day or a Category 5 hurricane, the solution is the same.

[00:19:45.389 --> 00:19:54.078]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:19:54.419 --> 00:19:56.100]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:19:57.023 --> 00:19:58.044]  But who is the enemy?
[00:19:58.584 --> 00:19:59.085]  Bin Laden.
[00:19:59.365 --> 00:20:00.425]  This is his MO.
[00:20:00.445 --> 00:20:01.666]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:20:01.726 --> 00:20:03.408]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:20:03.728 --> 00:20:10.472]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:20:10.893 --> 00:20:11.333]  Some U.S.
[00:20:11.373 --> 00:20:17.117]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:20:17.717 --> 00:20:21.180]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:31.467]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:20:31.688 --> 00:20:32.428]  Fabled enemies.

[00:21:21.041 --> 00:21:22.842]  Roger Masters is our guest.
[00:21:23.122 --> 00:21:25.803]  A lot of his material is published online.
[00:21:26.144 --> 00:21:40.851]  He's a top academic and professor at Dartmouth School of Government, Department of Government, with an Elson A. Rockefeller Professor of Government Chair, basically, and he was under the
[00:21:42.679 --> 00:21:44.881]  Head honcho of the neocons, Leo Strauss.
[00:21:44.941 --> 00:21:48.283]  Before he leaves us, I'll get him to diverge and get a little bit into that.
[00:21:49.224 --> 00:21:54.387]  But he got into researching what is fluoride, what are the different types of fluoride, why is it being put in the water.
[00:21:55.088 --> 00:21:58.470]  We now have all these studies from all over the world, what it does.
[00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:00.572]  And boy, it is not pretty.
[00:22:01.252 --> 00:22:02.653]  But he doesn't even want to get into that issue.
[00:22:02.673 --> 00:22:04.334]  He just wants to get into why it was put there.
[00:22:04.875 --> 00:22:06.456]  And so, please continue.
[00:22:06.496 --> 00:22:09.478]  You've gotten up to the German atomic program.
[00:22:10.336 --> 00:22:12.978]  I want to get through why it was put there and focus on what it does.
[00:22:12.998 --> 00:22:15.099]  I want to spend most of this time on what it does.
[00:22:15.979 --> 00:22:21.863]  I want to explain, though, that the start of putting any fluoride in water was super secret.
[00:22:22.883 --> 00:22:25.285]  Because the Manhattan Project had a problem in the 1940s.
[00:22:25.505 --> 00:22:31.348]  They didn't want anybody to know how far advanced we were in making a bomb.
[00:22:32.649 --> 00:22:38.412]  And we only had a very poor level of a supply of uranium in the United States.
[00:22:38.812 --> 00:22:39.533]  It's in rocks.
[00:22:40.796 --> 00:23:07.516]  It's a little bit complicated to get the uranium out compared to what Hitler had in Czechoslovakia and the consequence of that is that you had a waste product that was a very powerful acid and the scientist who was responsible for
[00:23:08.214 --> 00:23:08.794]  We're good to go.
[00:23:35.808 --> 00:23:36.248]  I think so.
[00:24:01.172 --> 00:24:10.716]  Who isn't afraid of saying, we're on a phone call like this, and he'll say, hey Roger, shut up and listen to me, because I've made a mistake in chemistry, and I make mistakes in chemistry, I rely on him.
[00:24:12.737 --> 00:24:25.302]  Science is about being able to engage in discussion, and so you should stop me any time when I get into the facts of the case that I've discovered, and say, well, what do I mean, or what about what, and so forth.
[00:24:26.743 --> 00:24:28.203]  Still, the big thing is that
[00:24:30.205 --> 00:24:39.207]  Because putting fluoride in water had to be secret, so people in Germany or Japan didn't know how much uranium we were processing.
[00:24:40.948 --> 00:24:43.008]  Everybody talked about putting fluoride in water.
[00:24:43.928 --> 00:24:51.190]  And the Manhattan Project started by putting sodium fluoride, which is the simple thing we have in toothpaste, in a couple of places.
[00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:53.871]  They compared two towns in New York, and there was no problem.
[00:24:54.611 --> 00:24:57.492]  And once they got it approved, they switched.
[00:24:58.012 --> 00:24:59.112]  And then they could dump
[00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:01.151]  Now let's be specific.
[00:25:01.171 --> 00:25:03.414]  You can have all the secret
[00:25:22.566 --> 00:25:37.932]  operations you want, but if you've got, you know, so many thousand drums of this by-product at this plant, the Germans can come take photographs of it, observe it, and then know how much of the isotopes you need that you're able to extract.
[00:25:38.452 --> 00:25:46.276]  So they, quote, secretly start dumping it in the water, and then at the end of the war they've got to get rid of the toxic waste.
[00:25:46.836 --> 00:25:49.157]  So they just say, ah, it's nutritious!
[00:25:50.077 --> 00:25:52.678]  We'll be right back with our guests in just 70 seconds.
[00:25:52.938 --> 00:25:53.999]  Stay with us.
[00:25:55.819 --> 00:25:58.220]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:10.225]  So many thousand drums of this by-product at this plant, the Germans can come take photographs of it, observe it, and then know how much of the isotopes you need that you're able to extract.
[00:26:10.746 --> 00:26:18.489]  So, they quote, secretly start dumping it in the water, and then at the end of the war they've got to get rid of the toxic waste.
[00:26:19.116 --> 00:26:21.478]  So they just say, ah, it's nutritious!
[00:26:22.358 --> 00:26:24.940]  We'll be right back with our guest in just 70 seconds.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:25.841]  Stay with us.
[00:26:26.001 --> 00:26:29.603]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:26:32.725 --> 00:26:36.147]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:26:37.608 --> 00:26:39.009]  It is a big idea.
[00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:41.131]  A new world order.
[00:26:41.851 --> 00:26:45.734]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:26:46.736 --> 00:26:48.857]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:26:49.297 --> 00:26:51.777]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[00:26:52.337 --> 00:26:54.778]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:26:55.518 --> 00:27:02.960]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:09.681]  For the first time in history, the elites plan for uncorruption.
[00:27:10.081 --> 00:27:12.842]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:18.783 --> 00:27:24.187]  We're about to give you the key of this interview.
[00:27:26.348 --> 00:27:26.929]  And that is...
[00:27:28.581 --> 00:27:32.023]  The name fluoride blurring the whole debate.
[00:27:32.863 --> 00:27:34.104]  We're not talking about fluoride.
[00:27:34.144 --> 00:27:37.626]  And as my guest was saying during the break to me, he said, look, it's not true.
[00:27:37.646 --> 00:27:41.047]  There hasn't been a lot of studies of what's actually being put in the water.
[00:27:41.468 --> 00:27:43.489]  There's been studies of sodium fluoride alone.
[00:27:43.509 --> 00:27:45.590]  He's actually absolutely right.
[00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:55.495]  The studies show that sodium fluoride alone, and he could differ, but the studies show increases in bone cancers in males, calcification of glands,
[00:27:57.250 --> 00:28:04.273]  But then he's going to come back and say, well, those are studies calling it fluoride, but it's really this other chemical compound that's a mixture of fluoride and other things.
[00:28:04.313 --> 00:28:11.156]  So, you know, really one of the world experts on this with the chemist, top chemist he's been working with.
[00:28:11.656 --> 00:28:12.456]  Please continue, sir.
[00:28:12.496 --> 00:28:13.377]  Let's get right into it.
[00:28:14.177 --> 00:28:18.839]  OK, well, look, let me start explaining things very simply.
[00:28:19.799 --> 00:28:21.600]  This silico fiber breaks down.
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:26.802]  First of all, it has the effect, which is very big, of increasing
[00:28:27.489 --> 00:28:34.491]  The amount of lead that a child will absorb if he's living in an old house with lead paint or any place in the environment where there's lead.
[00:28:35.432 --> 00:28:44.635]  So we did some studies in places where there was evidence of children's blood level by the community where they lived.
[00:28:45.915 --> 00:28:53.958]  Three big samples, one in Massachusetts, by county, one in New York State, by county, and then the National Health and Nutrition Evaluation Survey is the third study.
[00:28:54.961 --> 00:28:57.463]  And three different, big, huge samples.
[00:28:57.483 --> 00:28:59.584]  You know, one of 400,000 kids.
[00:28:59.604 --> 00:29:02.886]  And you just do statistical analysis.
[00:29:03.126 --> 00:29:15.515]  Okay, what's the average level, or percent of kids, for instance, who have more than what was the conventional level of danger, which is 10 micrograms per deciliter.
[00:29:15.555 --> 00:29:19.477]  That is, how many kids have high blood lead, or what's the average blood lead?
[00:29:19.497 --> 00:29:23.540]  And what we found is that where there's silico fertilizer in the water,
[00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:29.532]  I've taken everything into consideration, like economics and race and everything else.
[00:29:30.132 --> 00:29:32.653]  Where there's silicone in the water, there's more lead in the kids.
[00:29:33.934 --> 00:29:44.558]  And it's partly because silicone is a complicated atom that combines a lot of other things, and the chemistry of that, that's not my business.
[00:29:44.618 --> 00:29:46.459]  What's my business is the effects of it.
[00:29:46.999 --> 00:29:51.481]  And all the statistics involve taking lots of things into consideration,
[00:29:52.244 --> 00:29:52.404]  Amazing!
[00:29:52.424 --> 00:29:52.484]  Now,
[00:30:22.785 --> 00:30:27.526]  Interviewing chemists and doctors on this subject, they describe fluoride and the different variants of it.
[00:30:27.546 --> 00:30:29.806]  That's why Prozac is made out of it and so many other things.
[00:30:30.327 --> 00:30:35.087]  It's amazing because it's electrically basically charged and it just binds to everything.
[00:30:35.148 --> 00:30:36.328]  It goes through everything.
[00:30:36.848 --> 00:30:40.949]  It's really an active volatile thing to put that in dumbed down layman's terms.
[00:30:41.129 --> 00:30:41.909]  Is that accurate?
[00:30:43.529 --> 00:30:46.030]  My concern is not with the fluoride.
[00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:52.351]  It's with this other chemical and the point is that this other chemical, silicon fluoride,
[00:30:53.055 --> 00:31:03.620]  When you put them in water, the German study by Westendorf in 1975 is the only major study in the literature, and it showed it had big effect on brain chemistry.
[00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:10.783]  Okay, so separately... Okay, we keep calling it fluoride, but there's a different family of different compounds.
[00:31:11.063 --> 00:31:12.924]  What are they putting in the water in the cities?
[00:31:13.864 --> 00:31:21.868]  Over 90% of water fluoridation uses one of these two silico fluorides, either phosphoric acid, which is a liquid,
[00:31:22.708 --> 00:31:28.590]  Or Sodium Silicofluoride, which is very close, closely resembles it, but it's solid and it's in pebbles.
[00:31:29.071 --> 00:31:30.091]  In little pebbles.
[00:31:30.731 --> 00:31:42.676]  But these Silicofluorides are totally different from Sodium Fluoride, and they have these harmful effects on children or adults, and they have never been tested.
[00:31:44.517 --> 00:31:47.698]  The key thing, first of all, that they've never been tested.
[00:31:48.138 --> 00:31:49.439]  Don't take that, that's not my word.
[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:59.291]  The National Toxicology Program, in 2002, nominated these two chemicals for study on the grounds that their toxicology was not known.
[00:31:59.351 --> 00:32:03.116]  That is, the study of how they harm the brain or the body was not known.
[00:32:03.577 --> 00:32:05.019]  But it is known that they harm.
[00:32:05.339 --> 00:32:05.799]  Stay there.
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:06.540]  Stay there.
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:07.161]  A quick break.
[00:32:07.181 --> 00:32:08.283]  We'll be right back, Professor.
[00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:19.733]  Cameras are everywhere, above stoplights, on toll... ...that they've never been tested.
[00:32:20.354 --> 00:32:21.695]  Don't take that, that's not my word.
[00:32:22.375 --> 00:32:29.860]  The National Toxicology Program, in 2002, nominated these two chemicals for study on the ground.
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.501]  Their toxicology was not known.
[00:32:31.561 --> 00:32:35.304]  That is, the study of how they harm the brain or the body was not known.
[00:32:35.865 --> 00:32:37.286]  But it is known that they harm.
[00:32:37.606 --> 00:32:38.086]  Stay there.
[00:32:38.446 --> 00:32:38.827]  Stay there.
[00:32:38.927 --> 00:32:40.568]  A quick break, we'll be right back, Professor.
[00:32:47.549 --> 00:32:57.195]  Cameras are everywhere, above stoplights, on toll booths, and scanning the freeways just waiting to snap a photo of your license plate, only to slam you with ridiculous fines.
[00:32:57.536 --> 00:33:00.818]  In California, red light tickets are as high as $400.
[00:33:01.138 --> 00:33:05.461]  Spray Your Plate is a spray-on photoblocker that protects against all types of cameras.
[00:33:05.761 --> 00:33:11.805]  Spray Your Plate photoblocker spray reflects and protects against flash photo images, making your plate unreadable.
[00:33:12.246 --> 00:33:17.449]  One can of photoblocker will pay for itself many times over, last forever, and is completely unreadable.
[00:33:17.549 --> 00:33:19.110]  Don't give your money to the state.
[00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:19.911]  Spray your plate.
[00:33:47.569 --> 00:33:53.950]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:56.271]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:33:56.971 --> 00:33:57.991]  But who is the enemy?
[00:33:58.511 --> 00:33:59.031]  Bin Laden.
[00:33:59.311 --> 00:34:00.212]  This is his M.O.s.
[00:34:00.232 --> 00:34:01.632]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:34:01.672 --> 00:34:03.352]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:34:03.652 --> 00:34:10.414]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:34:10.814 --> 00:34:11.254]  Some U.S.
[00:34:11.294 --> 00:34:16.955]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:34:17.635 --> 00:34:21.158]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:34:21.538 --> 00:34:31.384]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:34:31.624 --> 00:34:32.365]  Fabled enemies.

[00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:54.473]  Are you tired of hearing that a cure for cancer is coming, but it will be available sometime in the future?
[00:34:54.833 --> 00:34:57.095]  At LaysMedInc, the future is here.
[00:34:57.475 --> 00:35:00.917]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with our patented methodology.
[00:35:01.137 --> 00:35:12.304]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can kill skin cancer and breast tumors of any size and many other types of cancer without adverse side effects at our outpatient facility.

[00:35:24.324 --> 00:35:25.124]  You want answers?
[00:35:25.885 --> 00:35:27.806]  Well, so does he.
[00:35:27.826 --> 00:35:31.088]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:35:31.649 --> 00:35:35.692]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:35:50.071 --> 00:35:52.773]  This is really important information, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:53.594 --> 00:35:55.635]  I've got some more vital information.
[00:35:55.655 --> 00:35:58.257]  It'll be a surprise at the bottom of the hour after our guest leaves us.
[00:35:58.658 --> 00:36:02.861]  We've got to move quick, Professor, because we've only got about 21 minutes left with you.
[00:36:02.881 --> 00:36:10.107]  I think for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and InfoWars.com listeners, though, I'm going to skip this next break coming up, because this is so important.
[00:36:10.527 --> 00:36:17.773]  And I've also got one of your studies here, the silico fluorides in higher blood lead, a national problem that particularly harms blacks.
[00:36:18.653 --> 00:36:27.819]  This is online as well, so before you leave, I want people to be able to go and read for themselves the different studies that you and your colleagues have done.
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.080]  Okay, continuing.
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.562]  Now, we kind of skipped ahead here.
[00:36:31.782 --> 00:36:37.526]  When did they decide to put these two different chemical compounds that they use publicly?
[00:36:37.586 --> 00:36:40.848]  The cover story is it's fluoride, but it's even more than that.
[00:36:40.868 --> 00:36:45.411]  And the studies that it's binding other heavy metals, bringing things in.
[00:36:47.509 --> 00:36:50.330]  I'll have to commit that I don't know some of the things that you have mentioned at all.
[00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:54.971]  Maybe it's just the professors that cut tunnel vision, but all I've focused on is that once
[00:37:16.451 --> 00:37:35.910]  We started to get rid of this waste from separating the uranium from the rock and decided to just throw that in the water supply because it was assumed that they would all come apart and it was never tested and as I said the National Toxicology Program in 2002
[00:37:38.198 --> 00:37:41.080]  Well, one of the things that has been a problem is that the
[00:38:08.385 --> 00:38:21.750]  American Dental Association and the AMA have repeatedly spoken about fluoridation as good, but they have not dealt with the fact that there were no studies
[00:38:22.774 --> 00:38:24.276]  Yeah, now let's be clear!
[00:38:39.933 --> 00:38:42.954]  Because if one thing is good, it doesn't mean another thing is good.
[00:38:43.354 --> 00:38:43.814]  Exactly.
[00:38:43.854 --> 00:38:48.675]  They say milk is good, but it isn't milk, it's battery acid that kids are drinking.
[00:38:49.256 --> 00:38:54.137]  So let's say sodium fluoride is good for your teeth and good for you, which there are studies on and it shows they're not.
[00:38:54.937 --> 00:38:57.118]  But regardless, let's just say it's good.
[00:38:57.438 --> 00:39:08.821]  What you're saying is, what we're hearing as, quote, fluoridation, isn't even that at all, and the studies are clear it's bad, they just don't know why, and now that's being looked at.
[00:39:10.435 --> 00:39:13.277]  Yeah, and look, let me give some concrete numbers.
[00:39:15.058 --> 00:39:24.284]  When you have lead in the water, or in the environment, the pollution in the environment, there's a higher lead in the kids.
[00:39:25.265 --> 00:39:28.427]  But when you have the silico fluoride, it goes up.
[00:39:28.447 --> 00:39:36.993]  So that just the lead alone, that increases the lead in kids' blood, okay?
[00:39:37.693 --> 00:39:38.134]  It's about
[00:39:40.963 --> 00:39:52.806]  The measure of micrograms per deciliter is about one of those measures, let alone... The silico fluorides boost these other poisons.
[00:39:53.246 --> 00:39:53.926]  That's right.
[00:39:54.246 --> 00:39:59.888]  It goes up in whites by another microgram per deciliter, from about 2.3 to 3.5.
[00:40:00.048 --> 00:40:01.468]  In blacks, it goes up about 2.5, from 5.5 to 8.
[00:40:09.668 --> 00:40:12.969]  It way increases the vulnerability of blacks.
[00:40:13.849 --> 00:40:15.830]  Oh, it just so happens to hurt blacks?
[00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:20.911]  I'm sure that hurts the feelings of the eugenicists that happen to run our entire government.
[00:40:21.251 --> 00:40:34.315]  Well, look, let me not get into eugenicists and just get into science because the main thing is that the effects of lead include learning disabilities, substance abuse, and violent behavior.
[00:40:35.715 --> 00:40:35.815]  Oh!
[00:40:36.570 --> 00:40:43.196]  Because lead destroys the ability of the brain chemicals that inhibit your behavior.
[00:40:43.216 --> 00:40:45.277]  It just slows down your impulsiveness.
[00:40:46.518 --> 00:40:49.781]  The brain chemicals aren't working right if you've got a lot of lead in your system.
[00:40:51.042 --> 00:40:53.564]  If you have a lot of it, it'll kill you.
[00:40:54.365 --> 00:41:03.753]  When I was on the Get the Lead Out of Vermont Task Force, the government task force in Vermont, we looked at this tradition of saying that, well,
[00:41:04.762 --> 00:41:08.105]  Only get worried if there's over 10 micrograms per deciliter of lead in the blood.
[00:41:08.746 --> 00:41:15.292]  And we found there was no level of lead in the blood that was completely without action, and we lowered the state
[00:41:16.738 --> 00:41:19.320]  The state level of concern from ten to five.
[00:41:19.381 --> 00:41:25.025]  Because where you have silico fluorides, then the whole scale has to be changed because it boosted.
[00:41:25.285 --> 00:41:26.326]  How much does it boost?
[00:41:27.727 --> 00:41:28.227]  That's right.
[00:41:28.427 --> 00:41:31.330]  I know you were just giving us the numbers, Professor, but give us those numbers again.
[00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:41.197]  Let's say you've got a Caucasian versus a Negroid, you know, in the same city with a set amount, and then give us the differences there.
[00:41:42.258 --> 00:41:44.740]  Well, if you take the
[00:41:46.767 --> 00:42:01.713]  White kids who have low silico fluoride and lead, they get up to about three and a half from two and two thirds or something like that.
[00:42:01.793 --> 00:42:05.034]  The black kids, it goes up from five and a half to eight.
[00:42:05.054 --> 00:42:07.775]  So that blacks are just much more vulnerable.
[00:42:07.895 --> 00:42:09.256]  Partly this is poverty.
[00:42:10.677 --> 00:42:11.817]  And it's calcium.
[00:42:13.249 --> 00:42:14.730]  In particular, and lots of other things.
[00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:16.831]  The chemistry of the body is complicated.
[00:42:16.851 --> 00:42:18.251]  Well, are there studies on that?
[00:42:18.291 --> 00:42:25.455]  I mean, you're saying it's the diets of the blacks, or is it on average the metabolic difference?
[00:42:26.055 --> 00:42:30.517]  When I do these studies, I'm just doing population studies to find out where it's bad.
[00:42:30.777 --> 00:42:35.840]  But certainly you've had other scientists contact you that have an idea why it's so much more worse for blacks.
[00:42:37.032 --> 00:42:55.309]  When we take the best evidence we've got and look at the difference between poor kids and kids who have average or above average income, poor kids, whether they're white or black, whether they're exposed to silico friars or not, it's always the poor kids who are most vulnerable to lead.
[00:42:56.261 --> 00:43:02.587]  And those vulnerabilities are much worse for blacks, and for everybody, they're much worse for the silico flora.
[00:43:02.707 --> 00:43:03.428]  Well, here's an example.
[00:43:03.448 --> 00:43:20.965]  There's more diabetes in, quote, Hispanics that have the, you know, Native American bloodline, and then certainly, you know, the cliché is true that, quote, Natives can't drink as much whiskey as, say, a Northern European who's had in their development, you know, generationally more drinking.
[00:43:21.485 --> 00:43:23.907]  And of course that gets into, you know, development and species.
[00:43:24.347 --> 00:43:30.951]  But I understand it's too many disciplines here and you're a scientist, you like to, or a professor who likes to look at the science and just go with what you have.
[00:43:30.971 --> 00:43:35.033]  So you're saying it's not a genetic difference or you don't know between blacks and whites.
[00:43:35.373 --> 00:43:40.576]  Well, actually the point is we think about genes versus environment.
[00:43:41.477 --> 00:43:48.381]  The phrase genes versus environment is like saying when you write an answer in long division
[00:43:49.201 --> 00:43:53.842]  Do you use the even numbers only when you write the answer, or the odd numbers only?
[00:43:55.043 --> 00:43:57.304]  You're going to say, Masters, you idiot!
[00:43:57.604 --> 00:43:59.344]  I use both even and odd numbers.
[00:44:00.164 --> 00:44:02.805]  You're not going to say, oh, you can use both even and odd ones.
[00:44:03.365 --> 00:44:09.427]  The point is that everything in life involves what are called interactions between the human and the environment.
[00:44:09.447 --> 00:44:09.787]  No, I agree.
[00:44:09.848 --> 00:44:17.530]  And that's the problem with most professors and academics and scientists, is they do narrowly only look at one little area, instead of that integration of the info.
[00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:21.931]  That's what I'm trying to do with my last year's research.
[00:44:21.971 --> 00:44:28.534]  To try and show how, once you look at the integration, sometimes you find that there's one thing that's easy to change.
[00:44:29.354 --> 00:44:32.315]  The message I want your listeners to hear is simple.
[00:44:33.476 --> 00:44:36.457]  This stuff in the water has never been tested for safety.
[00:44:37.077 --> 00:44:37.677]  Turn it off.
[00:44:38.618 --> 00:44:44.320]  And make sure it isn't put back in the water until it's tested and proven to be safe by utterly independent people.
[00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:46.521]  And I don't mean the bureaucrats and government agencies.
[00:44:47.613 --> 00:44:49.094]  They like to cover up mistakes.
[00:44:49.174 --> 00:44:55.115]  As I keep on asking people, when was the last time you heard of a bureaucrat who admitted his pants were around his ankles?
[00:44:55.996 --> 00:45:04.538]  Well, why is it that it's known that these fluoride compounds that resemble Prozac are being put in the water?
[00:45:04.578 --> 00:45:07.439]  And it just accidentally does all of this.
[00:45:07.579 --> 00:45:13.941]  And then the original studies I saw in Pulitzer Prize winning books from World War II is the Soviets and Germans believed
[00:45:14.761 --> 00:45:15.562]  But let me ask you a question.
[00:45:15.582 --> 00:45:21.328]  Chemical compounds that differ, and when they differ they have different effects.
[00:45:37.214 --> 00:45:46.580]  It's like, my asking the question when I'm talking to students, tell me, if you drink scotch, bourbon, and vodka in the same night, is that different than just drinking one scotch?
[00:45:47.501 --> 00:45:47.781]  Yes.
[00:45:47.901 --> 00:45:53.905]  I never, no student didn't admit that, well, mixing scotch, bourbon, and vodka was a very bad idea.
[00:45:54.645 --> 00:46:01.089]  I tried it once, my parents had a cocktail party when I was just going into my sophomore year of high school.
[00:46:01.502 --> 00:46:04.023]  They went out after the cocktail party and left a lot of glasses around.
[00:46:04.083 --> 00:46:05.924]  I decided to try them all at one night.
[00:46:06.204 --> 00:46:06.625]  Oh boy!
[00:46:08.345 --> 00:46:08.646]  Morning?
[00:46:08.746 --> 00:46:09.086]  Boy!
[00:46:09.466 --> 00:46:12.668]  I did the exact same thing a few times, yeah.
[00:46:12.968 --> 00:46:17.690]  I didn't dare tell my mother what happened, but I thought I'd roll my head down the sidewalk nice.
[00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:19.371]  But don't mix your drinks.
[00:46:20.111 --> 00:46:25.614]  And in the same way, when we mix chemicals, we have effects that we don't have one at a time.
[00:46:26.615 --> 00:46:29.336]  This is important because basically,
[00:46:29.983 --> 00:46:33.627]  The government regulates, the EPA, one thing at a time.
[00:46:35.068 --> 00:46:49.342]  And there's another thing, which is just in the paper today about, I think it's report, that there's a, the EPA has found a compound that seemed to be really dangerous, and they wanted to have some rules on it, and the White House intervened.
[00:46:49.972 --> 00:46:53.555]  And change the document to take some of the stuff out.
[00:46:53.676 --> 00:46:54.096]  That's right.
[00:46:54.136 --> 00:47:00.022]  Now the White House, now the White House is practicing medicine, science.
[00:47:00.662 --> 00:47:03.084]  They just decide on a whole host of issues.
[00:47:03.405 --> 00:47:04.946]  We're going to skip this break with our guest.
[00:47:05.006 --> 00:47:06.428]  We have a full ten minutes left with him.
[00:47:06.828 --> 00:47:09.551]  Got to go to InfoWars.com here, this part of the M and F stations.
[00:47:09.571 --> 00:47:10.632]  We'll be back in just a few minutes.
[00:47:11.653 --> 00:47:14.816]  Roger D. Masters, research professor at Dartmouth College, is our guest.
[00:47:15.572 --> 00:47:17.713]  I'm going to skip this break and talk to him.
[00:47:18.053 --> 00:47:25.638]  Look, bottom line, I want to explain to the listeners out there, and this is a fact, that we're told it's just fluoridation.
[00:47:26.650 --> 00:47:33.492]  When they can argue about that and then argue about what type of fluoride, calcium, stannous, sodium, but it's mainly, quote, sodium they claim they put in the water.
[00:47:33.852 --> 00:47:37.213]  But when you really look at it, that's the same thing I see with DU.
[00:47:37.233 --> 00:47:41.614]  They got a toxic waste, gotta get rid of it, they just put it in weapon systems and spray it around everywhere.
[00:47:41.994 --> 00:47:49.156]  Or they've gotta get rid of all the heavy metals and stuff that are left over from aluminum plants.
[00:47:49.716 --> 00:48:00.922]  And also, the manufacturer of different chemicals and the breakdown of petrochemicals making gasoline, and they just put that into lawn fertilizer and say, well, it doesn't get in our crops.
[00:48:01.142 --> 00:48:12.869]  Don't put it on crops you eat, but put it on your yard and it's lead and arsenic and all these toxins and your dog lays in it and its hair falls out, but it still runs right into your aquifer, so you drink it.
[00:48:13.289 --> 00:48:37.520]  So, I mean, what I'm really interested in, Professor, is this practice of claiming a dangerous, expensive, toxic waste that, for the strategic reasons in the economy, they want to delist as a toxic waste, and then they put, you know, use things as a cover to put it into, and that's what I see as the story of chemicals they were using, you know, during the atomic bomb production.
[00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:38.981]  Any comments on that front?
[00:48:39.588 --> 00:48:40.489]  For sure.
[00:48:40.569 --> 00:48:49.653]  The point is that when you think of humans, say, 200,000 years ago, if you had some junk, I suppose you might throw it in the water and say, well, it'll float down the river and be gone.
[00:48:50.314 --> 00:48:55.096]  But we now have a highly technical society.
[00:48:55.576 --> 00:49:01.559]  They thought just throwing this in the water supply, it would disappear and it would be gone, but it turned out to be dangerous.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.521]  And let me give a couple other statistics.
[00:49:05.301 --> 00:49:08.503]  Where this is in the water, there's a higher rate of cocaine use.
[00:49:09.588 --> 00:49:20.172]  Now, we measured that by the arrests, the proportion of people who are, uh, when you arrest violent criminals, who test positive for cocaine.
[00:49:21.113 --> 00:49:37.579]  Where there's, uh, where there's, uh, you can go from two people who are violent with, uh, uh, two out of a thousand criminals, uh, testing positive for cocaine, where there's no silico fluoride, and, and, uh,
[00:49:39.089 --> 00:49:47.872]  You go up by a couple where there's silico fluoride and you go up by even a little bit more if there's both silico fluoride and lead.
[00:49:47.952 --> 00:49:59.376]  So what I'm trying to get to is that we've got to put the dots together and be aware that when you have dangerous things, don't use them until you've tested them for safety.
[00:50:00.056 --> 00:50:04.438]  We think of that, obviously, if somebody starts selling a pill to cure a head cold.
[00:50:05.138 --> 00:50:07.439]  But why is it any different for putting something in the water
[00:50:07.952 --> 00:50:09.872]  I mean, you can brush your teeth, for goodness sakes!
[00:50:10.733 --> 00:50:14.113]  That is, the scientific community hasn't studied this.
[00:50:15.154 --> 00:50:19.955]  And one thing to remember is Einstein's advice about working in science.
[00:50:20.875 --> 00:50:24.355]  He said that you have to be intelligent and very, very stubborn.
[00:50:25.096 --> 00:50:30.397]  A chemical engineer is intelligent and very stubborn, but the critical thing here is that
[00:50:32.179 --> 00:50:37.561]  When you have a new idea, what Einstein pointed out is, at first you're completely ignored.
[00:50:37.641 --> 00:50:38.661]  Nobody pays attention to you.
[00:50:39.662 --> 00:50:42.703]  We've been working on this for over 10 years, and at first absolutely nobody paid attention.
[00:50:43.603 --> 00:50:44.484]  Then you're attacked.
[00:50:44.504 --> 00:50:46.604]  Oh, this is junk science, this is foolish.
[00:50:47.305 --> 00:50:50.046]  And then ultimately, everybody's going to agree it's true.
[00:50:50.066 --> 00:50:52.106]  That's what Einstein had with relativity.
[00:50:52.687 --> 00:50:58.269]  And I think once people begin to ask the question, have you tested this stuff for safety?
[00:50:58.569 --> 00:50:59.429]  What's the evidence?
[00:51:00.570 --> 00:51:01.390]  My website,
[00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:04.841]  We're going back to the full audience.
[00:51:04.901 --> 00:51:05.422]  Here we go.
[00:51:38.598 --> 00:51:41.359]  Professor Masters wants you to go to his website.
[00:51:41.399 --> 00:51:49.141]  It's http://www.dartmouth.edu.
[00:51:49.402 --> 00:51:58.324]  It's much easier just to type in Roger D. Masters into Google and it's the top link that comes up.
[00:51:58.344 --> 00:51:59.585]  You can read his research papers.
[00:52:00.245 --> 00:52:01.386]  And so much more.
[00:52:01.406 --> 00:52:12.351]  I mean, this is a nightmarish compound that they just accidentally decided out of the Manhattan Project to put in our water supplies.
[00:52:12.411 --> 00:52:14.072]  It was all just an accident.
[00:52:14.532 --> 00:52:21.895]  And it accelerates absorbing heavy metals and other toxins, causes massive increases in the brain, being drug addicted to cocaine.
[00:52:22.115 --> 00:52:23.996]  He was just going all over the study numbers on that.
[00:52:24.497 --> 00:52:26.297]  Massive increases in violent crime.
[00:52:26.858 --> 00:52:29.199]  It's all just an accident, you know.
[00:52:29.779 --> 00:52:33.962]  Again, it's a complete accident that any of this is going on.
[00:52:34.762 --> 00:52:38.725]  And, of course I'm being sarcastic, but he just covers the scientific fact.
[00:52:39.025 --> 00:52:41.486]  Okay, you were plugging your website as we came out of the break.
[00:52:41.827 --> 00:52:44.408]  Why do folks need to go there, Professor Masters?
[00:52:45.929 --> 00:52:58.377]  I was going to say, the website, the way I usually say it is after the tilde R Masters slash, the letter is A-H-A-B-S slash.
[00:52:59.711 --> 00:53:00.574]  Uh, at the very end.
[00:53:00.594 --> 00:53:08.353]  So, if you have trouble getting me with, uh, something at the end, go back to the cutoff end until you get to the R Masters.
[00:53:14.432 --> 00:53:16.994]  I found with radio, you try to give out long addresses, it doesn't work.
[00:53:17.574 --> 00:53:23.677]  Folks need to Google, you know, Fluoride, Roger D. Masters, and they will, because I'm doing it here.
[00:53:23.717 --> 00:53:24.678]  I'm testing it on Google.
[00:53:25.118 --> 00:53:25.818]  It's all you.
[00:53:26.239 --> 00:53:28.140]  People can read the studies and see the information.
[00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:30.601]  I've got to get you back up for a part two.
[00:53:30.621 --> 00:53:31.642]  We really appreciate you
[00:53:32.162 --> 00:53:34.964]  I see more and more citizens who are concerned, and some people in the public area,
[00:53:58.884 --> 00:54:04.027]  But I think one of our problems is the way we talk about, they did this, they did that.
[00:54:04.847 --> 00:54:06.188]  They are human beings like us.
[00:54:07.149 --> 00:54:14.633]  I think it's only fair to say that most of the people in the public health sphere don't know much about the details of this research.
[00:54:14.653 --> 00:54:15.673]  It's not that wide.
[00:54:15.754 --> 00:54:18.755]  Yeah, they're compartmentalized.
[00:54:19.135 --> 00:54:27.360]  And if you are in the medical profession, you've always been taught that fluoridation is a very good public step.
[00:54:28.132 --> 00:54:32.355]  You've never heard of a difference between sodium fluoride and silico fluoride?
[00:54:32.375 --> 00:54:33.856]  You think that fluoride is putting fluorine?
[00:54:33.916 --> 00:54:41.220]  Nobody puts pure fluorine in the water, for a lot of technical reasons that my chemical colleague Mike Copeland would explain.
[00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:47.384]  But the key, he's told me, the key thing is that there's some new scientific evidence.
[00:54:48.364 --> 00:54:57.650]  We've published in journals like Neurotoxicology, which is the best journal in the world on how toxic chemicals harm the brain, published two papers in that.
[00:54:58.511 --> 00:55:02.418]  So it's not just a funny professor from the Ivy League.
[00:55:03.059 --> 00:55:04.902]  And if I'm wrong, I want to know I'm wrong.
[00:55:05.142 --> 00:55:12.414]  But I think the crucial thing is when in doubt, for anything, the farm's health, behavior,
[00:55:14.354 --> 00:55:22.820]  Yeah, I mean, if they, quote, haven't studied it, which is their official story, why put it in when all the evidence shows it's not good for you?
[00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:34.548]  But separately, they have studied different types of fluoride and what it does, and it calcifies bones, causes bone fractures, cancers radically shoot up in boys.
[00:55:35.188 --> 00:55:50.697]  I mean, you know, just like all these studies on cell phones, my God, frying the testicles, frying the breast, frying any fast-growing cells that have a lot of hormonal flux going on that are already, you know, leaning towards being places where you'll have a cancer problem.
[00:55:51.137 --> 00:55:55.980]  I mean, bottom line, Professor, they know what's going on at the top.
[00:55:56.300 --> 00:55:58.942]  You're right, people mid-level and different compartments don't.
[00:56:01.943 --> 00:56:05.845]  I mean, look how much trouble they go to to keep this stuff in the water.
[00:56:06.466 --> 00:56:07.687]  I guess it's because they love us?
[00:56:08.787 --> 00:56:14.191]  No, I think a lot of it is simply that people don't like to admit they made a mistake.
[00:56:15.371 --> 00:56:19.234]  That is, a lot of it is just people want to have the idea.
[00:56:20.094 --> 00:56:24.297]  You're in a bureaucracy, and a bureaucrat is a kind of territorial animal.
[00:56:24.877 --> 00:56:27.719]  He owns his desk, and you better not get near it.
[00:56:27.859 --> 00:56:30.981]  He's got a bunch of things, and he's in charge of that, and that's his stuff.
[00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:35.661]  Well, my experience in the Army is that... Cover your ass.
[00:56:36.141 --> 00:56:45.342]  Well, I think actually we ought to go back and have a good draft, because I think not only we've destroyed a military manpower, but it's a very good thing for people to discover.
[00:56:46.202 --> 00:56:49.143]  First of all, the country has to have people to protect them.
[00:56:49.363 --> 00:56:50.883]  Hold on, I'm going to skip this break, too.
[00:56:50.903 --> 00:56:54.284]  I'm going to do three more minutes with our guest for your listening on InfoWars.com.
[00:57:00.065 --> 00:57:00.405]  Okay.
[00:57:03.682 --> 00:57:06.483]  Professor, you're there, right?
[00:57:06.823 --> 00:57:07.604]  Yeah.
[00:57:07.644 --> 00:57:15.947]  Look, in closing, I want to get you back up on all these issues, but I wanted to talk to you about Leo Strauss, The End Justifies the Means.
[00:57:17.907 --> 00:57:20.949]  What do you think of the fruit of Leo Strauss and the neocons?
[00:57:22.129 --> 00:57:23.710]  Leo Strauss wasn't a neocon.
[00:57:24.790 --> 00:57:32.533]  He was a believer in the need to read a great writer in the past, a great writer like Plato,
[00:57:33.371 --> 00:57:35.152]  Trying to figure out what he was trying to say.
[00:57:35.272 --> 00:57:36.053]  Or Machiavelli.
[00:57:36.433 --> 00:57:37.154]  Or Machiavelli.
[00:57:37.954 --> 00:57:51.263]  And you have to figure out when you go to read Machiavelli, you have to realize that everything he says, on the surface of it, have some meaning that's a little subtle.
[00:57:51.783 --> 00:57:52.664]  That's not trivial.
[00:57:52.824 --> 00:57:57.687]  Machiavelli, the year before he wrote The Prince, he was tortured for a full year and in jail.
[00:57:58.655 --> 00:57:59.836]  Because there was a change of government.
[00:57:59.856 --> 00:58:00.957]  He's been a government official.
[00:58:01.738 --> 00:58:11.706]  It was a very rebellious thing to do, to put out a blueprint of the black nobility's tactics.
[00:58:11.726 --> 00:58:13.568]  He was letting out the trade secrets.
[00:58:14.096 --> 00:58:15.177]  No, he wasn't at all.
[00:58:15.857 --> 00:58:20.700]  What he was trying... Well, I got something... Machiavelli was a very... Machiavelli was a very devious man.
[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:24.502]  I've written... I've studied a lot... Well, I mean, I've read both his books, but that's it.
[00:58:24.542 --> 00:58:31.986]  But, I mean, I take away from it that, you know, he was kind of pissed off, locked up in his house, kind of, you know, spilling the beans.
[00:58:32.046 --> 00:58:33.747]  Are you saying it was propaganda against people?
[00:58:34.127 --> 00:58:34.507]  No, no, no.
[00:58:34.567 --> 00:58:39.570]  He was worried because he saw... Alright, I'll put it bluntly.
[00:58:40.010 --> 00:58:43.372]  Machiavelli thought Christianity as a religion was bad.
[00:58:44.730 --> 00:58:49.093]  Because it denied the natural desires like sex, sinful.
[00:58:49.294 --> 00:58:49.674]  It was satanic.
[00:58:49.694 --> 00:58:51.555]  He thought that was a bad thing to do.
[00:58:51.936 --> 00:58:52.456]  It was not well.
[00:58:52.476 --> 00:58:53.957]  He thought the church was corrupt.
[00:58:54.798 --> 00:59:02.824]  He was trying to encourage people to go back to secular governments that separated religion from politics, which we now do and take for granted.
[00:59:03.385 --> 00:59:06.027]  They don't do that in the Muslim world all the time, right?
[00:59:06.087 --> 00:59:13.553]  So we better remember that there was a time, even in Western history, when the church
[00:59:14.304 --> 00:59:16.785]  had essentially a lot of political power.
[00:59:16.905 --> 00:59:20.347]  Yeah, so it's kind of a pre-Illuminati type deal.
[00:59:21.487 --> 00:59:28.831]  No, what he was trying to do was to figure out a way to get back to the frame of reference of pagan antiquity.
[00:59:29.351 --> 00:59:29.911]  That's what I just said.
[00:59:29.931 --> 00:59:31.812]  The only way he thought to do that was to shock people.
[00:59:32.012 --> 00:59:34.373]  I know, pagan antiquity, that's what the Illuminati wants.
[00:59:35.534 --> 00:59:41.817]  Well, all I'm saying is that he thought, he was a Republican, he believed in Republican government,
[00:59:43.082 --> 00:59:45.643]  But utterly secular Republican government.
[00:59:45.844 --> 00:59:46.984]  So you like Machiavelli?
[00:59:47.785 --> 00:59:55.291]  I think he's a very, very powerful thinker because he makes you ask questions about things you don't want to ask questions about.
[00:59:55.371 --> 00:59:55.591]  Sure.
[00:59:55.611 --> 00:59:57.092]  That's what Charles tried to teach us.
[00:59:57.412 --> 00:59:59.234]  Sure, the hypocrisy of the time.
[00:59:59.954 --> 01:00:06.299]  If you ask questions about things, the crucial thing for me is not what some thinker in the past said or didn't say.
[01:00:06.857 --> 01:00:11.222]  But how you can use that to learn how to read a book, to read science... Hold on, Professor.
[01:00:11.663 --> 01:00:12.083]  Hold on.
[01:00:12.203 --> 01:00:12.524]  Hold on.
[01:00:12.624 --> 01:00:15.807]  I mean, to pierce to the core of things through the propaganda.
[01:00:15.947 --> 01:00:16.388]  I gotcha.
[01:00:16.628 --> 01:00:16.909]  Hold on.
[01:00:16.929 --> 01:00:17.850]  Let's do one more minute here.
[01:00:21.814 --> 01:00:24.958]  I got into Straussian ideas.
[01:00:25.819 --> 01:00:27.400]  The Professor's saying he's not a neocon.
[01:00:29.687 --> 01:00:30.728]  Whatever, he hatched that.
[01:00:30.768 --> 01:00:32.209]  He's the presenter of it.
[01:00:32.229 --> 01:00:37.614]  And I brought up Machiavelli, and the professor got very possessive, I think is the word.
[01:00:37.634 --> 01:00:39.555]  I'm like, I'm an expert on Machiavelli.
[01:00:39.575 --> 01:00:40.436]  He was disagreeing with me.
[01:00:40.917 --> 01:00:44.580]  And I'm sure he's right about the main reason Machiavelli wrote those books.
[01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:47.042]  I mean, I read them like 15, 20 years ago.
[01:00:47.782 --> 01:00:52.186]  The point is, and I've seen more modern forms of subterfuge, more subtle.
[01:00:52.526 --> 01:00:54.988]  He was saying that he wanted us to go back to pagan antiquity.
[01:00:55.729 --> 01:01:00.230]  Oh, the point is that Machiavelli was a friend of somebody named Leonardo da Vinci.
[01:01:25.069 --> 01:01:40.258]  When he was in power in the Republic of Florence, he tried with Leonardo to design, to change the bed of the River Arno to make the city of Florence a seaport.
[01:01:41.058 --> 01:01:52.425]  Because with the discovery of America in 1492, the idea of making Florence a seaport, which could then engage in transatlantic trade, was very attractive.
[01:01:53.641 --> 01:01:53.801]  Yes.
[01:02:15.746 --> 01:02:18.787]  No, because they don't pay enough attention to read them very carefully.
[01:02:19.007 --> 01:02:33.011]  No, I remember seeing that, talking about how basically a bunch of twittering, you know, people, religionists, were blocking progress, and you're talking about the Renaissance, aren't you?
[01:02:34.012 --> 01:02:45.215]  Oh yeah, but I mean, I wrote a couple in my book, Machiavelli, Leonardo, and the Science of Power, which I tried to deal with how Machiavelli and Leonardo represent two aspects of
[01:02:46.229 --> 01:02:47.850]  The beginning of modern society.
[01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:50.372]  Modern society is unique in the world.
[01:02:51.653 --> 01:03:03.901]  The idea of using science the way we use science and we take it for granted, don't realize that the way we take science for granted is in a lot of people elsewhere in the world, particularly in the Middle East, it's all heresy.
[01:03:17.091 --> 01:03:24.517]  As best you could, without reading it through the filter of some book by somebody else.
[01:03:24.677 --> 01:03:26.219]  Yeah, getting it from some religion.
[01:03:26.359 --> 01:03:27.500]  Getting it from the oracles.
[01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:44.314]  And in particular, he was worried about the way in which the Christian view of original sin, going back to the Hebrew view in the Bible of original sin, raised questions about things that were utterly natural.
[01:03:45.453 --> 01:03:49.434]  And the point of this, St.
[01:03:49.554 --> 01:03:59.076]  Paul wrote these letters and claimed that the word of Jesus as God had to be sent to all tribes, all nations.
[01:04:00.556 --> 01:04:01.236]  That was what St.
[01:04:01.276 --> 01:04:03.957]  Paul said.
[01:04:04.577 --> 01:04:11.038]  What did Machiavelli realize when Amerigo Vespucci realized that this wasn't just an island, it was a continent?
[01:04:12.091 --> 01:04:15.673]  In fact, he was the first thinker to know there was a continent between Europe and Asia.
[01:04:16.473 --> 01:04:22.156]  Because his secretary, his assistant, Augustino Vespucci, was Americo Vespucci's cousin.
[01:04:23.417 --> 01:04:29.300]  And so he knew right away that there was this whole continent where people had never heard about Christianity.
[01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:33.082]  Well, how could God have been just because
[01:04:34.079 --> 01:04:34.659]  No, I understand.
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:36.201]  No, no, I understand the whole argument.
[01:04:36.221 --> 01:04:38.402]  That's the induction into the Illuminati speech.
[01:04:49.591 --> 01:04:50.572]  I understand all that.
[01:04:50.992 --> 01:04:52.433]  I mean, listen, we've got to get you back up.
[01:04:52.453 --> 01:05:07.104]  I didn't know you wrote a book about that, Professor, and we appreciate you coming on to explain to us that it's something far more complex than what we hear of as sodium fluoride being put in the water supply, and I hope you'll spend time with us again.
[01:05:07.124 --> 01:05:12.508]  People can just Google Roger D. Masters and find out about your prolific work, and I appreciate your time.
[01:05:13.388 --> 01:05:15.450]  Well, thank you very much for giving me a chance to
[01:05:16.403 --> 01:05:19.865]  Perhaps, encourage stopping the use of a dangerous chemical.
[01:05:20.265 --> 01:05:20.806]  All right, thank you.
[01:05:20.826 --> 01:05:21.626]  We appreciate your time.
[01:05:22.006 --> 01:05:23.687]  Well, good luck and good health to you all.
[01:05:23.867 --> 01:05:24.288]  Thank you.
[01:05:24.568 --> 01:05:25.128]  Appreciate it.
[01:05:27.209 --> 01:05:28.310]  Well, there we have it.
[01:05:28.330 --> 01:05:29.771]  It's always back to the same thing.
[01:05:30.932 --> 01:05:31.432]  Oh, man.
[01:05:33.113 --> 01:05:37.576]  And let me tell you, they will have you believe that they are not religionist.
[01:05:37.596 --> 01:05:44.660]  I don't know about him particularly, but they are religious in every sense of the word, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:05:46.235 --> 01:05:47.996]  Okay, look, I wanted to play both these clips.
[01:05:48.016 --> 01:05:49.236]  They're both like 10 minutes long.
[01:05:49.256 --> 01:05:51.557]  They're up on InfoWars.com.
[01:05:51.617 --> 01:05:55.058]  I may play one now and then do an overdrive.
[01:05:55.078 --> 01:06:02.441]  And I've got to go to a meeting about the studio, the TV studio they're building.
[01:06:02.461 --> 01:06:04.281]  Let's do 10 minutes of overdrive.
[01:06:05.362 --> 01:06:06.602]  Can you do 10 minutes of overdrive?
[01:06:07.602 --> 01:06:11.964]  Well, the problem is the network has the clip
[01:06:13.584 --> 01:06:17.025]  And I guess you can't keep my ISDN connected from Minnesota down here, can you?
[01:06:18.866 --> 01:06:19.746]  To go into Overdrive?
[01:06:21.467 --> 01:06:21.727]  John?
[01:06:22.588 --> 01:06:23.588]  Actually, no, we cannot.
[01:06:23.708 --> 01:06:24.608]  Hey, do me a favor then.
[01:06:25.149 --> 01:06:27.770]  Email me that other clip, both the clips, the URLs.
[01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:29.270]  Do you have those or did you flush those?
[01:06:30.711 --> 01:06:32.872]  I can send you the links through Instant Messenger.
[01:06:33.072 --> 01:06:38.394]  Yeah, we'll play Part 1 here and we'll play Part 2 in Overdrive from my studio.
[01:06:40.148 --> 01:06:42.629]  Hell, I may just start doing five or six hours every day, you know?
[01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:47.191]  Look, I know I opened the phones up hours ago and only took, like, five calls.
[01:06:47.951 --> 01:06:49.352]  They're not people still holding, are they?
[01:06:50.732 --> 01:06:56.375]  Yep, I gave you the fresh list on... Oh, goodness gracious, these poor people have been holding for hours and hours and hours.
[01:06:57.315 --> 01:06:59.316]  And I've got an important meeting I've got to go to.
[01:06:59.516 --> 01:06:59.916]  You know what?
[01:07:00.717 --> 01:07:03.098]  We'll take their calls, too, before the show ends.
[01:07:04.798 --> 01:07:07.019]  Joe, Mike, Mike, Billy, and Dr. Kelly.
[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:08.540]  Right?
[01:07:09.537 --> 01:07:10.238]  Yep, that's the right one.
[01:07:12.359 --> 01:07:12.639]  Okay.
[01:07:13.079 --> 01:07:17.843]  Well, anybody, it won't be on the AM and FM dialogue or before we have internet or satellite, but it will be on the internet.
[01:07:17.903 --> 01:07:21.045]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:07:21.845 --> 01:07:23.587]  You will be able to see the clip.
[01:07:23.627 --> 01:07:24.807]  I'll just play it from there.
[01:07:26.829 --> 01:07:28.210]  Let's go ahead now and do this.
[01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:35.034]  I wanted to spend a whole show on this, and I think tomorrow I'm going to comment on this more.
[01:07:36.317 --> 01:07:43.765]  But I found all these old militia clips from Donahue and other shows, and Donahue is acting like a complete clown.
[01:07:43.845 --> 01:07:54.015]  I used to really hate him for this, but then I'd seen these, you know, back in the early 90s, this was like in 94, right after the Waco butchering, and I'd seen these clips going around then on VHS tapes and things passed around.
[01:07:54.696 --> 01:07:56.717]  Where he's going, you live in the woods, don't you?
[01:07:56.897 --> 01:07:57.398]  The woods!
[01:07:57.418 --> 01:08:00.880]  Like these militia guys, they're just totally calm, making him look like a fool.
[01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:08.604]  I know two other guys that are up on stage, and they're laying out, they're coming for your guns, it's a new world order, they're gonna do this and that, and then now look!
[01:08:09.605 --> 01:08:10.005]  Let me see.
[01:08:11.538 --> 01:08:14.380]  Fourteen years later, this is in 1994.
[01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:17.922]  Fourteen years later, how much of this has come true?
[01:08:18.543 --> 01:08:19.544]  How much of this happened?
[01:08:19.564 --> 01:08:21.185]  Because they were only going off government documents.
[01:08:21.845 --> 01:08:23.687]  And just how right the militia movement was.
[01:08:23.727 --> 01:08:32.594]  But then a year later, after this TV show, the feds bombed OKC, and Bill Clinton blamed it on the militia, when it was a federal operation, and that's when the militia went underground.
[01:08:33.354 --> 01:08:37.956]  So, government-sponsored terror is used to head off movements that could stop their tyranny.
[01:08:38.436 --> 01:08:43.078]  So, let's go ahead, but they only do it because it justifies the means.
[01:08:43.098 --> 01:08:46.720]  They want to bring us enlightenment, and they've got to kill a lot of us to do that first.
[01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:53.602]  It's the great work we're talking about here for Lucifer, they believe.
[01:08:54.383 --> 01:08:56.384]  So, let's go ahead and play the militia.
[01:08:56.404 --> 01:08:59.605]  The video is even more incredible up on InfoWars.com.
[01:09:00.005 --> 01:09:02.206]  Actually, for PrisonPlanet.tv, let's punch this up.
[01:09:03.883 --> 01:09:07.126]  And I will play clip two in overdrive so people can actually see the video.
[01:09:07.667 --> 01:09:08.868]  Over at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:09:08.908 --> 01:09:11.010]  Just have it where I can get to it later.
[01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:11.210]  Good.
[01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:13.412]  Yeah, yeah, later I'm going to have that for everybody.
[01:09:15.169 --> 01:09:16.010]  Now, folks get confused.
[01:09:16.030 --> 01:09:21.217]  There's all these other internet streams, little radio networks, internet things that carry the show, and there's scores of them.
[01:09:21.718 --> 01:09:24.241]  And they, and the deads always let a lot of them do it.
[01:09:24.261 --> 01:09:26.484]  The problem is some then hold out that they are us.
[01:09:27.204 --> 01:09:30.328]  And because we're so lenient with things, it's kind of like, make copies of my film.
[01:09:30.348 --> 01:09:31.570]  People say, well, they're now my film.
[01:09:32.091 --> 01:09:33.352]  And I copyright your film, you know.
[01:09:34.173 --> 01:09:34.993]  No, that's my film!
[01:09:35.033 --> 01:09:35.754]  How dare you!
[01:09:36.014 --> 01:09:36.994]  No, the film's mine now!
[01:09:37.435 --> 01:09:40.056]  So we have to kind of explain to you, this is the Genesis Network.
[01:09:40.076 --> 01:09:41.317]  This is where the show originates from.
[01:09:41.857 --> 01:09:45.459]  And on those other networks and things, you won't be hearing my show when it ends.
[01:09:45.499 --> 01:09:48.640]  You've got to go to mfallwars.com when we go into overdrive.
[01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:52.182]  The only place to listen is on the internet or at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:09:53.863 --> 01:10:01.967]  All of the schooning pilot fish are trying to attach themselves, which I don't mind a few pilot fish hanging off me.
[01:10:02.728 --> 01:10:05.851]  But if they bite me and hate me while they're sucking my blood, it makes me angry.
[01:10:06.532 --> 01:10:14.419]  And they always squeal and yell and pull their hair out and make up a bunch of stuff about me and engage in blackmail and all this other crap.
[01:10:14.659 --> 01:10:16.000]  I'm not going to be too friendly towards you.
[01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:19.724]  It's your own delusional BS.
[01:10:19.744 --> 01:10:24.048]  You can lie to yourself all day about the stuff you've done, but the truth is I know the truth and that's what matters.
[01:10:25.145 --> 01:10:26.365]  And that's why I'm going to defend myself.
[01:10:26.406 --> 01:10:27.426]  But I'm already digressing.
[01:10:27.966 --> 01:10:30.727]  Listen at how the militia was so right.
[01:10:30.747 --> 01:10:31.668]  Now these are real guys.
[01:10:31.708 --> 01:10:32.728]  John Trotman and others.
[01:10:33.088 --> 01:10:34.889]  These are all great guys up there on stage.
[01:10:35.469 --> 01:10:36.650]  I know two of them personally.
[01:10:37.270 --> 01:10:38.110]  And I'm going to get them on.
[01:10:38.130 --> 01:10:40.911]  I'm going to track them down and get both these guys back on.
[01:10:41.992 --> 01:10:44.233]  But Bob Flesher and Trotman.
[01:10:45.613 --> 01:10:46.514]  I know they're still around.
[01:10:47.214 --> 01:10:48.194]  Just amazing guys.
[01:10:48.214 --> 01:10:49.795]  This is 14 years ago.
[01:10:50.455 --> 01:10:52.196]  These guys 20 years ago were telling the truth.
[01:10:52.556 --> 01:10:53.777]  Now listen to it.
[01:10:54.017 --> 01:10:54.657]  We'll be right back.
[01:10:56.331 --> 01:11:05.539]  The United States of America, they believe that the United States government is prepared to usurp the Constitution and break down doors and confiscate guns.
[01:11:05.619 --> 01:11:08.282]  Am I lying to these people, Bob Fletcher and Jim Trockman?
[01:11:08.562 --> 01:11:09.103]  John Trockman.
[01:11:09.183 --> 01:11:10.404]  John, sorry, it says John here.
[01:11:11.345 --> 01:11:11.845]  You believe this?
[01:11:12.326 --> 01:11:13.567]  No, not quite like that.
[01:11:14.568 --> 01:11:15.528]  Not the U.S.
[01:11:15.568 --> 01:11:15.949]  government.
[01:11:16.866 --> 01:11:17.486]  Which government?
[01:11:17.506 --> 01:11:18.407]  The One World Government?
[01:11:18.567 --> 01:11:18.847]  Yes, sir.
[01:11:19.827 --> 01:11:20.648]  The United Nations?
[01:11:20.828 --> 01:11:21.148]  Yes, sir.
[01:11:21.528 --> 01:11:24.630]  And you're in the woods now, and you're not, neither of you, you're not in the woods?
[01:11:24.690 --> 01:11:25.190]  No, no, no.
[01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:26.751]  Yeah, you're from Montana.
[01:11:27.231 --> 01:11:28.191]  The city of Noxon?
[01:11:28.472 --> 01:11:28.792]  Yes, sir.
[01:11:28.812 --> 01:11:30.633]  The little town of Noxon.
[01:11:30.673 --> 01:11:31.353]  350 people?
[01:11:31.733 --> 01:11:32.153]  Maximum.
[01:11:32.173 --> 01:11:32.533]  Uh-huh.
[01:11:32.734 --> 01:11:33.714]  And you're living in the woods?
[01:11:34.234 --> 01:11:34.414]  No.
[01:11:34.534 --> 01:11:35.275]  No, you're not.
[01:11:35.495 --> 01:11:36.535]  Is anybody in Montana?
[01:11:37.556 --> 01:11:38.416]  Just their plain homes.
[01:11:38.496 --> 01:11:41.178]  You're sitting next to Ray Southwell, who does, from Michigan.
[01:11:41.518 --> 01:11:43.739]  You gather in the woods, don't you?
[01:11:44.619 --> 01:11:45.079]  In Michigan?
[01:11:45.099 --> 01:11:45.740]  When we train?
[01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:46.120]  Yeah.
[01:11:46.812 --> 01:11:47.352]  That's correct.
[01:11:47.432 --> 01:11:48.392]  But you're not living there.
[01:11:49.053 --> 01:11:49.853]  I don't quite understand.
[01:11:49.873 --> 01:11:50.753]  Stop right there.
[01:11:51.493 --> 01:11:54.594]  See, this propaganda wouldn't sell today.
[01:11:55.114 --> 01:11:57.074]  Like, you live in the woods, you're some kind of hillbilly.
[01:11:57.094 --> 01:12:00.115]  Then they go to the black guy, well these are white supremacists, what are you doing with them?
[01:12:00.135 --> 01:12:01.275]  And the black guy's like, no they're not.
[01:12:01.295 --> 01:12:03.756]  In fact, if you go watch their videos, they all speak out against it.
[01:12:04.656 --> 01:12:07.057]  But that's the whole point, is that's what they would tell the public.
[01:12:07.397 --> 01:12:12.278]  And this was running up, the demonization of the militia, started a year before the feds bombed OKC.
[01:12:12.998 --> 01:12:16.620]  Just like the demonization of Alciada began right before 9-11.
[01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:18.582]  So you can see the build-up.
[01:12:18.902 --> 01:12:21.824]  But I mean, just listen how ridiculous Phil Donahue is.
[01:12:21.864 --> 01:12:22.244]  Here it is.
[01:12:22.584 --> 01:12:24.025]  Yeah, that's correct.
[01:12:24.085 --> 01:12:25.046]  But you're not living there.
[01:12:25.706 --> 01:12:27.868]  I don't quite understand when you say living there.
[01:12:27.888 --> 01:12:33.031]  I live in northern Michigan and I have 20 acres that I live on and there's a house there.
[01:12:33.271 --> 01:12:33.452]  Right.
[01:12:33.732 --> 01:12:37.694]  You're with Ken Adams and Doug Hall here as well as
[01:12:38.965 --> 01:12:41.446]  The ever popular, highly regarded Jim Johnson.
[01:12:42.106 --> 01:12:43.226]  You're from Ohio, are you?
[01:12:43.426 --> 01:12:44.746]  That's correct, Columbus to be exact.
[01:12:44.766 --> 01:12:45.006]  Yeah.
[01:12:45.307 --> 01:12:46.307]  You're in a militia area?
[01:12:46.627 --> 01:12:49.748]  The Ohio Unorganized Militia, duly elected communications officer.
[01:12:49.788 --> 01:12:49.988]  Yeah.
[01:12:50.388 --> 01:12:53.829]  What's, what are you, incidentally, I thought this was an all-white area.
[01:12:53.849 --> 01:12:54.749]  By the way, start again.
[01:12:54.849 --> 01:12:56.609]  I mean, Donahue's extremely manipulative.
[01:12:56.629 --> 01:13:07.852]  You know, speaking out against the war now, he seems good, but he was puffing up, getting in their face, growling at them with the body language, trying to manipulate them into a fight, and the guys were all laughing at him, so Donahue looked like a complete fool.
[01:13:07.912 --> 01:13:08.352]  Back to it.
[01:13:09.555 --> 01:13:10.397]  Yeah.
[01:13:11.318 --> 01:13:16.587]  Incidentally, I thought this was an all-white, Aryan nation, don't tread on me kind of group.
[01:13:16.948 --> 01:13:19.432]  Yeah, well, the state of the country doesn't have an affirmative action program.
[01:13:19.472 --> 01:13:20.053]  All are invited.
[01:13:21.216 --> 01:13:28.601]  And you're here, among other things, to say that you share their concern about the pending crisis that's coming to this country?
[01:13:28.801 --> 01:13:29.541]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:13:30.262 --> 01:13:38.106]  Being a minority in our community, we've seen certain actions that these conspiratorial theorists have talked about actually happen in our communities.
[01:13:38.146 --> 01:13:39.087]  Tell us what they are.
[01:13:39.107 --> 01:13:41.108]  I'm having a little trouble getting it from the civilians here.
[01:13:42.168 --> 01:13:45.410]  You look like you're from IBM compared to the rest of the group.
[01:13:45.530 --> 01:13:47.991]  We can spot you from the air, Bob.
[01:13:48.031 --> 01:13:49.752]  You better get yourself your fatigues here.
[01:13:50.032 --> 01:13:51.273]  I'm going to get spotted from the air.
[01:13:51.293 --> 01:13:52.654]  Yes, you are.
[01:13:52.834 --> 01:13:53.714]  You're serious about this.
[01:13:53.754 --> 01:13:55.295]  Please, I want this audience to know.
[01:13:55.375 --> 01:13:56.115]  Oh, show them the film.
[01:13:56.135 --> 01:13:57.016]  This is from Michigan.
[01:13:57.176 --> 01:13:59.897]  Let me just, while we're showing it, you can make your case here.
[01:13:59.917 --> 01:14:05.100]  The basic problem is rather simple, and Americans have become concerned
[01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:10.405]  That here in the United States, we're losing our constitutional rights.
[01:14:10.986 --> 01:14:20.397]  We are slowly being moved into what amounts to being a one world, and that's George Bush and Gorbachev's words, a one world, new world order.
[01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:25.201]  And what that amounts to, basically, is socialism.
[01:14:25.521 --> 01:14:26.622]  One world socialism.
[01:14:27.122 --> 01:14:31.423]  And if you don't like it, you're going to be moved off someplace where they can control you.
[01:14:32.023 --> 01:14:38.145]  And the problem is, in terms of the militia across the United States, this is exactly what we're addressing.
[01:14:38.565 --> 01:14:40.086]  It has nothing to do with racism.
[01:14:40.866 --> 01:14:44.869]  As, I guess, our compadre from Ohio would testify.
[01:14:44.889 --> 01:14:52.594]  It has nothing to do with a handful of crazy people running through the woods and practicing to shoot unknown, mysterious people.
[01:14:53.074 --> 01:15:03.040]  We already are witnessing, as we talk today, Puerto Rico, San Juan, Puerto Rico is under martial law, folks, that everybody said would never happen.
[01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:04.261]  That's as we speak today.
[01:15:04.281 --> 01:15:06.823]  This has to do with the sweep of
[01:15:08.249 --> 01:15:12.431]  Uh, public housing for drugs and, uh, weapons in Puerto Rico.
[01:15:12.451 --> 01:15:13.271]  That's the excuse.
[01:15:13.331 --> 01:15:15.052]  That's the excuse that's being used.
[01:15:15.332 --> 01:15:25.336]  Now, the only point they don't make is that the tremendous tonnage of cocaine and narcotics coming into the United States is being done on C-130 military aircraft.
[01:15:25.757 --> 01:15:33.380]  It's been that way since, uh, all the way back in the 80s, and it was part of the Oliver North business with bringing in the drugs and the guns down into countries.
[01:15:35.061 --> 01:15:39.705]  You're afraid of the suspension of what you believe is your right to bear arms.
[01:15:40.025 --> 01:15:42.067]  That's really at the root of this.
[01:15:42.427 --> 01:15:44.969]  You're afraid the feds are coming along to take your guns away.
[01:15:45.249 --> 01:15:50.273]  My basic concern is what kind of a country am I going to leave my children?
[01:15:51.274 --> 01:15:53.636]  I am very, very concerned about that.
[01:15:54.773 --> 01:16:00.074]  And that's the reason that I'm in the militia, is what kind of a country am I going to leave for my children?
[01:16:00.234 --> 01:16:02.015]  That's the same way with me, Phil.
[01:16:02.855 --> 01:16:05.776]  You're the chaplain, right?
[01:16:05.796 --> 01:16:08.176]  At 63, my youngest daughter just had a little girl.
[01:16:08.216 --> 01:16:09.456]  Well, she's a year old now.
[01:16:10.517 --> 01:16:13.877]  And I was amazed that at 63, I started to really appreciate
[01:16:17.108 --> 01:16:17.888]  This little person.
[01:16:35.296 --> 01:16:35.716]  I don't know.
[01:16:59.864 --> 01:17:02.349]  How will this express itself, this preservation?
[01:17:02.789 --> 01:17:03.531]  This preservation?
[01:17:03.691 --> 01:17:07.618]  What we do in Ohio is we arm people with knowledge, is what we do.
[01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:11.082]  The knowledge that your rights are eroding.
[01:17:11.342 --> 01:17:11.882]  That is correct.
[01:17:11.902 --> 01:17:12.422]  You've got to save them.
[01:17:12.463 --> 01:17:13.783]  Alright, stop it right there.
[01:17:13.843 --> 01:17:15.144]  I'm going to come back and play more.
[01:17:15.164 --> 01:17:20.227]  We're going to Overdrive today and tomorrow I'll probably play this for the full AM and FM audience.
[01:17:20.587 --> 01:17:25.390]  If you just Google American Militia Media Spin into Google, it'll come up.
[01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:27.331]  American Militia dash Media Spin.
[01:17:27.351 --> 01:17:29.653]  You can go to Infowars.com and watch.
[01:17:29.793 --> 01:17:31.914]  Well, there's links to hours of this stuff if you want.
[01:17:32.835 --> 01:17:36.337]  But, this is the type of stuff we're dealing with here.
[01:17:37.841 --> 01:17:39.501]  Just the outright demonization.
[01:17:39.521 --> 01:17:41.882]  See, most of these guys were former military intelligence.
[01:17:42.562 --> 01:17:53.864]  Well, they had sources in that, and that's when Delta Force started buying off local governments, CIA takeover, government narcotics trafficking expanding, and they were doing drills for gun confiscation.
[01:17:54.645 --> 01:18:05.247]  And I then woke up a few years, or right after this, about a year after this, and started going and videotaping these drills and seeing it for myself, and I found out, my God, these old guys on TV are telling the truth!
[01:18:06.067 --> 01:18:11.170]  And then here we are a few years later, 15 years later, right down getting our throats slit.
[01:18:11.950 --> 01:18:12.951]  It's all coming to a head.
[01:18:13.011 --> 01:18:13.431]  Stay with us.
[01:18:15.092 --> 01:18:20.935]  High fuel prices for gasoline and diesel are taking a huge bite out of budgets for individuals and businesses.

[01:21:23.515 --> 01:21:26.516]  But I'm gonna go into overdrive, I don't know, 10, 15, 20 minutes.
[01:21:27.756 --> 01:21:28.777]  One place only.
[01:21:30.938 --> 01:21:32.478]  InfoWars.com.
[01:21:32.878 --> 01:21:33.479]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:21:34.847 --> 01:21:35.708]  One stream only.
[01:21:36.428 --> 01:21:37.889]  One place to get it is the internet.
[01:21:38.309 --> 01:21:39.390]  At those specific streams.
[01:21:39.450 --> 01:21:40.490]  Not the Genesis streams.
[01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:41.511]  Not any other streams.
[01:21:43.912 --> 01:21:46.493]  You know, just to see how right these men were.
[01:21:46.513 --> 01:21:48.114]  To see how on target they were.
[01:21:48.134 --> 01:21:54.438]  And to see how they were ridiculed and laughed at by the brainwashed, dumbed down, massive people in that audience.
[01:21:56.087 --> 01:22:06.152]  But now you go to YouTube and Google and you see these clips and every single person's agreeing, unless it's some sitcom handle guy getting paid a hundred grand a year to bring his country down.
[01:22:06.652 --> 01:22:15.076]  I am sick of all the people in government who still go along with this evil, claiming you're the patriots, claiming you're the good guys, that you're getting rid of our freedom for America.
[01:22:15.896 --> 01:22:19.818]  You're doing that to make sure the bankers can rob the living daylights out of us.
[01:22:20.098 --> 01:22:22.079]  Let's play a few more minutes of this clip.
[01:22:22.099 --> 01:22:22.419]  Here it is.
[01:22:23.325 --> 01:22:28.189]  This preservation, what we do in Ohio, is we arm people with knowledge, is what we do.
[01:22:28.930 --> 01:22:31.612]  The knowledge that your rights are eroding.
[01:22:31.872 --> 01:22:32.252]  That is correct.
[01:22:32.272 --> 01:22:33.453]  You gotta say this, friends.
[01:22:33.533 --> 01:22:36.936]  If you don't say this, this audience is gonna not know what in the hell.
[01:22:36.956 --> 01:22:38.617]  You look like a barbershop quartet.
[01:22:38.697 --> 01:22:39.979]  I don't know, you're a sex guy.
[01:22:40.019 --> 01:22:40.579]  Go ahead.
[01:22:40.599 --> 01:22:41.179]  Go ahead.
[01:22:50.106 --> 01:23:00.232]  Every day American people from all across the country call us and they tell us two things.
[01:23:00.493 --> 01:23:02.054]  One, there's too much government.
[01:23:02.194 --> 01:23:07.297]  There's too much federal intervention into our states and in our personal lives that our states are losing our sovereignty.
[01:23:07.941 --> 01:23:08.461]  Back up.
[01:23:08.701 --> 01:23:10.982]  Give the control back to our local elected officials.
[01:23:11.362 --> 01:23:12.482]  Let's uphold our sheriffs.
[01:23:12.502 --> 01:23:18.724]  Let's give power back to our sheriffs who we esteem highly, who's our only elected law official in this country.
[01:23:19.104 --> 01:23:20.185]  Back off federal government.
[01:23:20.445 --> 01:23:21.805]  Give the state some power again.
[01:23:22.145 --> 01:23:23.546]  That's what the people are concerned about.
[01:23:23.646 --> 01:23:33.669]  And by the way, in reference to that, in reference to the possibility of them being a quartet, we have turned it into a huge singing organization of governors.
[01:23:33.989 --> 01:23:37.530]  As of today, the governors are wrapping up a convention.
[01:23:38.090 --> 01:23:44.574]  The governors of the United States of America have said exactly what Mr. Stucco has just been saying.
[01:23:44.594 --> 01:23:46.376]  That the federal government is taking too much power.
[01:23:46.636 --> 01:23:47.276]  Exactly.
[01:23:47.456 --> 01:23:50.498]  And that the governors need it back in their own backyards.
[01:23:50.778 --> 01:23:52.299]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:23:52.319 --> 01:23:52.720]  Go ahead.
[01:23:55.626 --> 01:23:56.367]  Okay, that's good.
[01:23:56.807 --> 01:23:57.087]  That's good.
[01:23:57.107 --> 01:24:03.951]  When we go into overdrive, I'll play the last three minutes of that clip and then ten minutes more of the other clip from Donahue.
[01:24:03.971 --> 01:24:04.652]  And there's more.
[01:24:04.692 --> 01:24:11.056]  There's more to the show online at Infowars.com and there's a bunch of other Donahues and other programs where they're viciously
[01:24:12.125 --> 01:24:13.126]  Attacking the militia.
[01:24:13.426 --> 01:24:21.310]  And Sean Hannity says, arrest all militia members, anybody that talks about a New World Order, every child should have a microchip, and that's conservative.
[01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:24.532]  No, these are New World Order dirtbags in both parties.
[01:24:25.412 --> 01:24:36.358]  By the way, the stock market right now is down over 300 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and that is with hundreds of billions being pumped in today.
[01:24:37.459 --> 01:24:39.420]  They're talking about the dollar completely dying.
[01:24:41.044 --> 01:24:43.507]  Now is the time to expose government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:24:43.587 --> 01:24:45.369]  I'm telling you, we're in prime territory for that.
[01:24:45.729 --> 01:24:47.671]  Please go to InfoWars.com.
[01:24:47.712 --> 01:24:48.292]  Do not wait.
[01:24:48.753 --> 01:24:51.996]  Get fabled enemies exposing how they carried out the attacks with intelligence ops.
[01:24:53.561 --> 01:24:57.103]  You know, get Truth Rising so people really know who the 9-11 Truth Movement is and why.
[01:24:57.123 --> 01:24:58.584]  I didn't even get into it today.
[01:24:58.704 --> 01:25:00.665]  YouTube openly announcing censorship.
[01:25:01.326 --> 01:25:03.447]  Other websites banning 9-11 Truth.
[01:25:04.387 --> 01:25:09.970]  Openly admitting that Lieberman sends them, the staff basically tells them what to ban and what not to ban.
[01:25:11.571 --> 01:25:13.772]  The media running around attacking 9-11 Truth.
[01:25:14.032 --> 01:25:18.675]  You can also tell operatives in our own movement, they're all activating right now with their disinfo.
[01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:21.122]  We're winning, thank God.
[01:25:21.703 --> 01:25:25.609]  The hearts and minds, but the enemy can stage terror attacks, economic collapse, you name it.
[01:25:25.629 --> 01:25:29.495]  So please visit InfoWars.com and don't forget, it's up to you to carry the ball.
[01:25:29.535 --> 01:25:31.198]  You can't just passively sit here and listen.
[01:25:32.406 --> 01:25:36.087]  And then hope that everything works out and thinking, oh good, Alex is on the air.
[01:25:36.147 --> 01:25:36.627]  No, no, no, no.
[01:25:36.727 --> 01:25:37.907]  Tell more people about the show.
[01:25:37.947 --> 01:25:39.188]  Tell them about the free podcast.
[01:25:39.208 --> 01:25:42.589]  Tell them we're coming back up live right now in one minute at InfoWars.com.
[01:25:42.609 --> 01:25:43.729]  But start your own radio shows.
[01:25:43.989 --> 01:25:44.569]  Take action.
[01:25:44.589 --> 01:25:45.409]  Your own websites.
[01:25:46.090 --> 01:25:49.410]  People are really listening right now because everything we've said has come true.
[01:25:49.690 --> 01:25:51.471]  So now's the time to strike while the iron's hot.
[01:25:51.691 --> 01:25:53.892]  We'll see you back on the other side at InfoWars.com.
[01:25:53.912 --> 01:25:54.472]  We're live.
[01:25:54.732 --> 01:25:55.212]  Stay with us.
[01:25:56.311 --> 01:25:58.113]  Thank you for listening to TCN.
[01:25:58.133 --> 01:25:59.654]  Alright, take care Alex, good job.
[01:25:59.774 --> 01:26:00.715]  Hey John, appreciate it.
[01:26:00.755 --> 01:26:01.636]  I'll see you tomorrow, bubba.
[01:26:01.696 --> 01:26:02.757]  Anytime, we'll see you tomorrow.
[01:26:02.797 --> 01:26:03.498]  Take care, bubba.
[01:26:03.638 --> 01:26:03.918]  Buh-bye.
[01:26:04.679 --> 01:26:05.660]  Alright, buh-bye.
[01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:06.781]  He's good at those buh-byes.
[01:26:07.322 --> 01:26:09.183]  Hey, you know what?
[01:26:09.203 --> 01:26:13.267]  Let's not even do intro music here as we go into overdrive.
[01:26:13.528 --> 01:26:17.652]  For those watching on PrisonPlanet.tv live or watching on the archive there,
[01:26:19.703 --> 01:26:29.896]  For folks that don't know about PrisonPlanet.tv, that's where all my films are in super high quality, where we do the live streams every day, and it's 15 cents a day and that pays for the big servers and the crew and everything we're doing.
[01:26:30.197 --> 01:26:35.684]  We're pretty low budget, but it still costs a lot, so we want to thank all the PrisonPlanet.tv members that are out there.
[01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:52.678]  Okay, I want to go ahead and finish up this clip, and then there's another clip from the same show, but just look at how calm they are, how well-spoken, how focused, how serious they were, and how they were talking about martial law was being beta-tested then.
[01:26:53.199 --> 01:26:54.781]  Now, fast-forward 14 years, 15 years,
[01:26:56.002 --> 01:27:00.364]  Army Times comes out and says, yeah, we're going to use regular army brigades in the U.S.
[01:27:00.784 --> 01:27:10.148]  to combat people rioting or civil disturbance, and we hope we don't have to kill Americans, and we're going to use microwave guns, and this is Homeland Security, and NORTHCOM runs America.
[01:27:10.428 --> 01:27:13.669]  Just like Iraq's occupied, the United States is now being occupied.
[01:27:14.009 --> 01:27:15.310]  This is third-world country stuff.
[01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:19.092]  Congress has been told, you're not involved in the bailouts and the corporate looting.
[01:27:19.532 --> 01:27:20.792]  Nobody's going to jail for it.
[01:27:20.972 --> 01:27:24.534]  We're not going to bail your houses out, we're just going to take your money and bail the bankers out.
[01:27:25.134 --> 01:27:25.894]  But it's not a bailout.
[01:27:25.914 --> 01:27:27.375]  They've already secured all their assets.
[01:27:27.595 --> 01:27:28.576]  It's a consolidation.
[01:27:28.616 --> 01:27:29.456]  It's a new world order.
[01:27:29.896 --> 01:27:31.917]  So let me go ahead and punch up this screen for me.
[01:27:32.618 --> 01:27:38.861]  I'll go ahead and play this for the viewers out there, and we'll play the other clip for everybody as well.
[01:27:38.901 --> 01:27:39.241]  Here it is.
[01:27:41.070 --> 01:27:41.931]  Anarchy, yeah.
[01:27:42.271 --> 01:27:44.534]  And so, training in the woods, what?
[01:27:44.654 --> 01:27:47.117]  In other words, you really think this is going to come down here?
[01:27:47.137 --> 01:27:52.983]  You have to understand that in the area that I live, it is woods.
[01:27:53.124 --> 01:27:55.546]  My closest neighbors are half a mile away.
[01:27:55.687 --> 01:27:58.950]  I don't understand how higher interest rates and a big...
[01:28:03.038 --> 01:28:21.605]  I gotta say something here, look how domesticated Donahue is, I mean, he's going, you live in the woods, a house in the woods, oh my god, you should be like 90% of people in an urban area, so when we have a Great Depression, instead of 80% being rural and being able to survive and only 7 million starved in the Great Depression,
[01:28:22.125 --> 01:28:23.486]  Tens of millions more will starve!
[01:28:23.726 --> 01:28:24.466]  It's so crazy!
[01:28:25.047 --> 01:28:25.547]  My God!
[01:28:25.727 --> 01:28:26.968]  Live in the woods and have guns!
[01:28:27.128 --> 01:28:28.869]  You're not a domesticated slave like me!
[01:28:29.069 --> 01:28:32.591]  Oh, it's so shocking to see someone that's somewhat free and informed!
[01:28:32.871 --> 01:28:34.892]  And 15 years before their time!
[01:28:35.152 --> 01:28:35.832]  Oh my God!
[01:28:36.013 --> 01:28:36.693]  It's so scary!
[01:28:36.913 --> 01:28:37.033]  Oh!
[01:28:37.273 --> 01:28:37.373]  Oh!
[01:28:37.533 --> 01:28:38.294]  Oh my God!
[01:28:38.954 --> 01:28:42.977]  But he sees a cop or a guy in a black ski mask in New York with a machine gun.
[01:28:43.298 --> 01:28:44.399]  He feels safe.
[01:28:44.839 --> 01:28:45.860]  Oh, FEMA camps.
[01:28:46.580 --> 01:28:48.442]  Cops with machine guns and black masks.
[01:28:49.082 --> 01:28:50.143]  And cameras everywhere.
[01:28:50.163 --> 01:28:52.065]  It makes me feel so safe to have a criminal government.
[01:28:52.525 --> 01:28:57.049]  But just these citizens with guns.
[01:28:57.369 --> 01:28:58.510]  They live in the woods.
[01:28:58.830 --> 01:29:00.011]  They have water wells.
[01:29:00.031 --> 01:29:01.552]  They're not drinking their fluoride.
[01:29:02.213 --> 01:29:04.114]  Dear God, they're crazy people.
[01:29:05.137 --> 01:29:07.038]  Let's go back to these dangerous people!
[01:29:07.218 --> 01:29:08.439]  You live in the woods, though!
[01:29:08.879 --> 01:29:09.459]  The woods!
[01:29:09.519 --> 01:29:10.740]  My God, it's crazy!
[01:29:11.381 --> 01:29:13.582]  Oh, my God, this guy's out of his mind!
[01:29:13.882 --> 01:29:15.703]  I bet he doesn't think GMO's good for him!
[01:29:16.203 --> 01:29:17.044]  Oh, God, help us!
[01:29:17.244 --> 01:29:17.864]  Oh, no!
[01:29:18.304 --> 01:29:19.125]  Oh, it's all over!
[01:29:19.145 --> 01:29:21.406]  There it is, folks.
[01:29:26.069 --> 01:29:28.070]  Oh, for some reason the YouTube clip's not playing.
[01:29:28.710 --> 01:29:29.631]  Good old YouTube.
[01:29:29.731 --> 01:29:30.651]  I tell ya, it tortures me.
[01:29:30.691 --> 01:29:31.552]  Here, we'll just play it from here.
[01:29:35.218 --> 01:29:37.300]  The economic situation of this country.
[01:29:37.841 --> 01:29:40.303]  We're four and a half trillion dollars in debt.
[01:29:40.824 --> 01:29:43.087]  We're going in debt at a billion dollars a day.
[01:29:43.647 --> 01:29:49.674]  What will happen when all of the money collected on taxes goes to interest on the debt?
[01:29:50.595 --> 01:29:55.659]  If you look at Argentina or Brazil, you have hyperinflation, an economic situation.
[01:29:56.859 --> 01:29:59.121]  Collapse of the economy, rioting in the streets.
[01:29:59.221 --> 01:30:00.482]  Anarchy, yeah.
[01:30:00.802 --> 01:30:03.084]  And so, training in the woods, what?
[01:30:03.184 --> 01:30:05.745]  In other words, you really think this is going to come down here?
[01:30:05.765 --> 01:30:11.669]  You have to understand that in the area that I live, it is woods.
[01:30:11.790 --> 01:30:13.591]  My closest neighbor is in the MLA.
[01:30:14.351 --> 01:30:23.742]  I don't understand how higher interest rates and a big service load on the debt is going to be cured by wearing fatigues and running around the woods as a grown man huffing and puffing.
[01:30:23.762 --> 01:30:26.105]  What's the point?
[01:30:29.168 --> 01:30:34.071]  If we were not dressed like this, if we were not dressed like this in training, we wouldn't be sitting here talking to you today.
[01:30:34.371 --> 01:30:44.636]  And we want the American people to pull together, contact their elected officials, and tell them what the problems are, and let's sit down and start working out the problems instead of just... John, here's what you told us.
[01:30:44.656 --> 01:30:45.737]  Here's what you told us.
[01:30:46.617 --> 01:30:48.358]  No, but I mean, John, I think said this.
[01:30:49.838 --> 01:30:53.319]  It's about informing the public about what's going on in this country.
[01:30:53.959 --> 01:30:59.081]  You say it's a sell-off, the government is selling us out, the Constitution's in peril.
[01:30:59.481 --> 01:31:02.302]  You believe that our government is involved in a population reduction.
[01:31:03.376 --> 01:31:03.896]  Come on.
[01:31:04.597 --> 01:31:10.342]  Our government wants to disarm the citizens, create a one world government, then do a world reduction of the population.
[01:31:10.822 --> 01:31:17.728]  And what we're seeing now is foreign military equipment and chemical warfare equipment being brought into our country.
[01:31:17.808 --> 01:31:18.969]  Come on.
[01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:23.053]  Okay, if I might respond, I'm going to step on John's toes here.
[01:31:24.329 --> 01:31:31.533]  You gotta ask yourself, and you folks that are finding some of this humorous, number one, this was photographed in Texas a couple of weeks ago.
[01:31:31.733 --> 01:31:31.973]  Yeah.
[01:31:31.993 --> 01:31:37.816]  Alright, this is a Frog short-range Russian chemical biological missile.
[01:31:38.256 --> 01:31:39.977]  We have photographed several of these.
[01:31:40.037 --> 01:31:42.638]  We also have this equipment on videotape.
[01:31:42.738 --> 01:31:44.379]  With a red star and a gold finish.
[01:31:44.419 --> 01:31:47.060]  Sorry about that, folks, but this is in Texas.
[01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:50.622]  If that doesn't bother you, then maybe we should be... How do you know that?
[01:31:50.642 --> 01:31:51.483]  Okay, excuse me.
[01:31:52.443 --> 01:31:54.505]  By the way, I'm going to hit pause again.
[01:31:54.525 --> 01:31:56.647]  I mean, I've got to get out here and go to a meeting.
[01:31:56.667 --> 01:31:59.469]  I've got about ten more minutes to play of this, but this is what's incredible.
[01:32:00.810 --> 01:32:13.942]  Now, in 2008, we knew NORTHCOM did this five years ago, officially, but they didn't advertise it, said Canadian and Mexican and Eastern Bloc troops will be used to patrol America during an economic collapse for martial law.
[01:32:14.784 --> 01:32:15.666]  Or terrorist attack.
[01:32:16.147 --> 01:32:23.881]  Then, in early 2008, the NORTHCOM publicly signed a deal with the Canadian and Mexican generals on Canadian TV.
[01:32:25.014 --> 01:32:26.975]  And then Congress said, we'd like to be able to see that.
[01:32:26.995 --> 01:32:29.115]  We're supposed to fund that or agree to that.
[01:32:29.135 --> 01:32:29.955]  We passed the laws.
[01:32:30.396 --> 01:32:32.776]  And they said, nope, continuity of government, sit down and shut up.
[01:32:33.256 --> 01:32:35.797]  And now Paulson comes out and says trillions in bailouts.
[01:32:36.517 --> 01:32:38.258]  It's not 700 billion, it's trillions and trillions.
[01:32:38.638 --> 01:32:41.119]  And Congress started talking a week and a half ago saying, well, we have to look at that.
[01:32:41.139 --> 01:32:42.739]  And he said, sit down and shut up.
[01:32:43.179 --> 01:32:45.280]  Presidential Decision Directive 51.
[01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:47.761]  Everything these guys said in 1994.
[01:32:47.981 --> 01:32:49.021]  What is that, 14 years ago?
[01:32:54.955 --> 01:32:55.735]  Everything came true.
[01:32:56.556 --> 01:32:59.237]  And now it's all declassified about the population reduction?
[01:33:00.017 --> 01:33:01.438]  The public just can't deal with it.
[01:33:01.638 --> 01:33:03.198]  It's your fault out there, folks.
[01:33:03.458 --> 01:33:13.803]  We have given you all the information, and there's clips of me in 95, 96, 97 saying this stuff, and these guys all over the place before that, you know, in the 80s saying it.
[01:33:14.323 --> 01:33:15.123]  And other people.
[01:33:15.183 --> 01:33:16.504]  I mean, they've all been right.
[01:33:16.564 --> 01:33:17.624]  They told you!
[01:33:18.184 --> 01:33:19.145]  And you laugh at them!
[01:33:21.066 --> 01:33:22.166]  Let's just go back to it.
[01:33:22.386 --> 01:33:22.986]  Unbelievable.
[01:33:23.687 --> 01:33:24.427]  Unbelievable.
[01:33:26.618 --> 01:33:32.020]  Flatbeds of Russian tanks and armament that they brought into Montana.
[01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:33.721]  Our own people photographed this.
[01:33:33.881 --> 01:33:35.341]  Alright, I'm sorry about that.
[01:33:35.361 --> 01:33:37.142]  The Russians are coming again, you tell him.
[01:33:37.202 --> 01:33:37.862]  They're here.
[01:33:38.122 --> 01:33:38.843]  Oh, they're here.
[01:33:39.143 --> 01:33:39.503]  I see.
[01:33:39.543 --> 01:33:42.104]  While you're still handling your microphone.
[01:33:42.144 --> 01:33:43.344]  Raising up in the militia.
[01:33:43.565 --> 01:33:43.845]  Right.
[01:33:43.885 --> 01:33:45.765]  There's two ways to defuse the militia.
[01:33:46.065 --> 01:33:52.348]  Number one is people like you taking the information, taking our fears and proving that we're wrong.
[01:33:52.988 --> 01:34:04.394]  That will diffuse the militia movement, or people like you in the mainstream news media shine a light on this information and find out it's true, then let's get the country back on its true course.
[01:34:04.514 --> 01:34:08.716]  Why is it so easy for us to glean support from the public?
[01:34:09.196 --> 01:34:10.617]  We don't even have to go after them.
[01:34:10.637 --> 01:34:11.457]  People are calling us.
[01:34:11.477 --> 01:34:12.278]  Let me tell you why.
[01:34:12.478 --> 01:34:14.759]  Because I think you're stocking ammunition.
[01:34:15.259 --> 01:34:17.080]  I think you have semi-automatic.
[01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:18.321]  I think you've got automatic.
[01:34:20.384 --> 01:34:23.166]  I mean, listen to what a raving loony he is.
[01:34:23.487 --> 01:34:24.588]  I know why they're calling you.
[01:34:24.888 --> 01:34:26.750]  I think you're stuck in ammunition.
[01:34:27.110 --> 01:34:29.532]  I think you got it in there like it's illegal.
[01:34:30.353 --> 01:34:32.915]  He's like a totally domesticated creature, man.
[01:34:34.076 --> 01:34:36.438]  But, you know, all the liberals I know now are buying guns.
[01:34:36.458 --> 01:34:37.279]  They finally get it.
[01:34:38.019 --> 01:34:39.481]  They finally broke their conditioning.
[01:34:40.141 --> 01:34:43.444]  And most of the Kool-Aid drinking's going on from the Sarah Palin crowd.
[01:34:44.285 --> 01:34:46.427]  Yeah, by the... Oh, it's... This country's so gone.
[01:34:48.089 --> 01:34:50.350]  Go ahead and punch me up on screen here.
[01:34:51.811 --> 01:34:55.393]  We're not going to look at this hot booty video right here that's beside it.
[01:34:55.413 --> 01:35:02.396]  I'm going to give Paul a laugh in there, being stupid.
[01:35:02.757 --> 01:35:08.640]  You've got to laugh about some of this while the stock market's plunging and the bankers are raping the living daylights out of our entire country.
[01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:10.521]  I'm going to play this ten minute clip.
[01:35:11.377 --> 01:35:12.438]  And then we're just going to end the show.
[01:35:12.478 --> 01:35:13.739]  It's going to go into retransmission.
[01:35:13.759 --> 01:35:19.685]  I had a bunch of big guests, key economic analysis, a ton of info about cell phones coming out, and a lot more.
[01:35:19.725 --> 01:35:20.806]  I meant to get into the sun.
[01:35:20.826 --> 01:35:26.571]  NASA's having a special announcement on Friday about the future of the sun, and they say they're really worried about it.
[01:35:27.412 --> 01:35:31.315]  It's cooling off, and in 300 years of being recorded, never done this.
[01:35:32.737 --> 01:35:36.941]  It's snowing in South Africa right now, normally about 100 degrees there, but they're in feet of snow.
[01:35:38.442 --> 01:35:42.505]  But it's global warming, man, you better pay a global tax to them or everything's over.
[01:35:43.426 --> 01:35:52.093]  Let's go ahead and go to this page and play this clip for everybody that is out there.
[01:35:54.095 --> 01:36:00.700]  Let's go ahead and show this fool, Donahue, really making a fool out of himself.
[01:36:02.001 --> 01:36:02.422]  Here it is.
[01:36:05.327 --> 01:36:15.893]  I think you've got hardware on tripods, and you're looking out, you probably have night vision glasses, and every time you hear a tree crack in the woods, you're gonna blow half the forest away!
[01:36:16.093 --> 01:36:16.913]  Where does that happen?
[01:36:17.194 --> 01:36:19.155]  Your fear is that happened in America!
[01:36:19.595 --> 01:36:22.797]  You must be- You know what, I got a comment on this too, I'm just gonna back it up.
[01:36:23.717 --> 01:36:24.698]  I got a comment on this.
[01:36:25.078 --> 01:36:32.282]  People always tell me, oh, you're afraid, you're paranoid, you're scared, you hear a creak at night, you shoot bullet holes in the wall.
[01:36:32.822 --> 01:36:33.622]  No, it's the opposite.
[01:36:33.983 --> 01:36:37.945]  We know we have a criminal government, we know they're so evil, it's incalculable.
[01:36:39.540 --> 01:36:45.883]  We know, because we've been so gullible, we know that they've gotten away with so much, and then we have the courage to come up and fight them head-to-head.
[01:36:46.443 --> 01:36:52.566]  And these guys have the courage to, way before their time, to go on TV and warn everybody about exactly what was going to happen.
[01:36:52.786 --> 01:36:55.848]  Talking about hyperinflation and devaluation coming for his kids.
[01:36:56.208 --> 01:36:58.309]  Now his kids, who were five, are now twenty.
[01:36:59.190 --> 01:36:59.710]  And he was right.
[01:36:59.730 --> 01:37:02.831]  I mean, this is like prophecy, but it wasn't.
[01:37:03.011 --> 01:37:04.392]  It was all in the documents.
[01:37:04.892 --> 01:37:06.673]  That's why they were right then, I'm right now.
[01:37:07.013 --> 01:37:07.774]  And I was right then.
[01:37:08.780 --> 01:37:10.001]  And many other people were right then.
[01:37:10.481 --> 01:37:12.784]  This is when I was waking up when stuff like this was on TV.
[01:37:13.244 --> 01:37:14.285]  This is what I looked into.
[01:37:14.305 --> 01:37:16.267]  I remember watching stuff like this on television.
[01:37:16.867 --> 01:37:20.971]  And I was on air just a year later, when the Feds bombed OKC, to go expose that.
[01:37:22.270 --> 01:37:25.172]  So here he is going, you're scared, you're creeping around.
[01:37:25.813 --> 01:37:28.915]  No, they're bold on TV, knowing they were going to get heat.
[01:37:28.975 --> 01:37:32.438]  Some of these guys got set up and sent to prison and all sorts of stuff happened.
[01:37:32.478 --> 01:37:33.158]  My God.
[01:37:33.659 --> 01:37:36.321]  Feds would plant pipe bombs on militia leaders' property.
[01:37:36.841 --> 01:37:39.423]  It was hellish what they went through and I salute them.
[01:37:39.903 --> 01:37:44.787]  I salute you for what you've done defending this republic in the great spirit of our forefathers.
[01:37:44.827 --> 01:37:45.248]  I really do.
[01:37:45.928 --> 01:37:52.378]  So I'm going to go ahead and finish this clip, and then when this clip's over, we'll go to rebroadcast right here on the one and only GCN Radio Network.
[01:37:52.418 --> 01:37:56.104]  Don't forget PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:37:56.424 --> 01:37:58.026]  Here it is, my friends.
[01:38:00.020 --> 01:38:11.265]  Lucas, I think you've got hardware on tripods, and you're looking out, you probably have night vision glasses, and every time you hear a tree crack in the woods, you're gonna blow half the forest away!
[01:38:11.445 --> 01:38:12.126]  Where does that happen?
[01:38:12.146 --> 01:38:12.986]  Where does that happen in America?
[01:38:13.006 --> 01:38:13.826]  You must be a little bit paranoid, Phil.
[01:38:13.846 --> 01:38:14.947]  You must be a little bit paranoid, Phil.
[01:38:14.967 --> 01:38:15.887]  You must be a little bit paranoid, Phil.
[01:38:15.907 --> 01:38:16.808]  You must be a little bit paranoid, Phil.
[01:38:16.828 --> 01:38:17.668]  You must be a little bit paranoid, Phil.
[01:38:17.688 --> 01:38:18.549]  You must be a little bit paranoid, Phil.
[01:38:18.569 --> 01:38:19.389]  You must be a little bit paranoid, Phil.
[01:38:19.429 --> 01:38:20.229]  You must be a little bit paranoid, Phil.
[01:38:20.249 --> 01:38:21.090]  You must be a little bit paranoid, Phil.
[01:38:21.110 --> 01:38:21.930]  You must be a little bit paranoid, Phil.
[01:38:21.950 --> 01:38:22.771]  You must be a little bit paranoid, Phil.
[01:38:22.791 --> 01:38:23.691]  You must be a little bit paranoid, Phil.
[01:38:23.731 --> 01:38:24.612]  You must be a little bit paranoid, Phil.
[01:38:24.632 --> 01:38:25.452]  You must be a little bit paranoid, Phil.
[01:38:25.472 --> 01:38:26.252]  You must be a little bit paranoid, Phil.
[01:38:26.272 --> 01:38:27.093]  You must be a little bit paranoid, Phil.
[01:38:27.113 --> 01:38:27.773]  You must be a little bit
[01:38:28.180 --> 01:38:29.580]  Makes your case, don't you?
[01:38:29.740 --> 01:38:30.321]  Absolutely.
[01:38:30.341 --> 01:38:35.222]  That the federal government is coming down, they've got all the weapons and the problems, Phil.
[01:38:35.262 --> 01:38:39.063]  The problem is, regardless of what anyone in this audience... One show at a time, this young man is speaking.
[01:38:39.323 --> 01:38:40.643]  Can't be heard if you talk.
[01:38:40.683 --> 01:38:48.645]  No matter what anyone in this audience feels, or anyone in the country feels about David Koresh and his followers, whether they're innocent or guilty, they deserve due process.
[01:38:48.665 --> 01:38:50.486]  And they didn't receive that.
[01:38:50.686 --> 01:38:54.767]  And regardless of what you, Phil, about the adults, the children certainly weren't guilty of anything.
[01:38:55.047 --> 01:38:55.947]  And that's what we're concerned
[01:38:56.047 --> 01:39:00.609]  This is evidence of what the federal government is capable of.
[01:39:01.289 --> 01:39:06.132]  And you are concerned about the house-to-house sweeps for armament, aren't you?
[01:39:06.652 --> 01:39:09.153]  You think the feds are capable of that, aren't you?
[01:39:09.193 --> 01:39:10.454]  You think the feds are capable?
[01:39:10.514 --> 01:39:14.275]  Wait a minute, we don't think that the feds are capable of it.
[01:39:14.655 --> 01:39:20.038]  As I said two minutes ago, Marshall Law and San Juan Puerto Rico folks
[01:39:20.518 --> 01:39:24.742]  With full military force dragging men, women, and children from their apartments.
[01:39:24.762 --> 01:39:25.182]  It is true.
[01:39:25.222 --> 01:39:26.463]  With no warrants whatsoever.
[01:39:26.483 --> 01:39:27.204]  It is true.
[01:39:27.244 --> 01:39:31.327]  And when a young woman asked, what's going on at four in the morning?
[01:39:32.088 --> 01:39:33.369]  She said, where are your warrants?
[01:39:33.449 --> 01:39:38.914]  They smashed her door down with a sledgehammer and said to her, this is our warning.
[01:39:39.074 --> 01:39:40.995]  Damn it, this is our warrant.
[01:39:41.356 --> 01:39:42.116]  Bring your stuff out.
[01:39:42.156 --> 01:39:44.678]  And they went completely and dragged them out in the street.
[01:39:45.299 --> 01:39:47.601]  What happened to the tenant that a man's home is his castle?
[01:39:47.941 --> 01:39:48.862]  And a woman's as well.
[01:39:49.322 --> 01:39:51.843]  And Anson, I'll give you a chance, hang on just a second, I promise.
[01:39:52.123 --> 01:39:54.823]  We'll get the charts on in just a second.
[01:39:55.223 --> 01:40:01.465]  It is true, you know, you turn on the evening news, you know, you see them, those guys are knocking them doors down and there's, you know, people inside in their underwear.
[01:40:01.705 --> 01:40:04.025]  And you're on Channel 7 Action Evening News!
[01:40:04.345 --> 01:40:08.066]  It does seem, now, you, I assume you're upset about this as well.
[01:40:08.106 --> 01:40:13.147]  But the excuse of public housing is ridiculous because when they're done with that, it'll be your private homes.
[01:40:13.487 --> 01:40:14.588]  They'll come door-to-door.
[01:40:14.608 --> 01:40:20.952]  Those of you that are finding humor in it, you better never take your clothes off, so you're not in underwear on the next evening news.
[01:40:21.012 --> 01:40:32.060]  Well, what is true, we've got, and you see this, and this is what happens when the country gets fearful, and you guys are ready for this, and you're not gonna let it happen, including the man of God here, the good old Chaplin.
[01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:36.643]  And when they come and kick your doors in, you better damn well hope some of these guys are handy.
[01:40:36.683 --> 01:40:36.943]  Yeah.
[01:40:37.123 --> 01:40:39.825]  Otherwise, you better have your own semi-automatic.
[01:40:39.845 --> 01:40:42.567]  Now, when they come for you guys, when they come for you guys,
[01:40:42.927 --> 01:40:43.928]  You're going to be ready, aren't you?
[01:40:44.149 --> 01:40:46.631]  When they come for us, we won't be there.
[01:40:47.132 --> 01:40:48.754]  When they come for us, they better have guns.
[01:40:48.794 --> 01:40:49.955]  I bet you know how to use a gun, though.
[01:40:49.975 --> 01:40:50.176]  Yeah, I do.
[01:40:50.196 --> 01:40:53.519]  Well, if they come for my gun, I'm simply going to let them have it.
[01:40:56.932 --> 01:40:57.813]  Funny, funny joke.
[01:40:58.213 --> 01:40:59.113]  You're serious?
[01:40:59.153 --> 01:41:01.315]  You pull the trigger on a federal agent coming up to your place?
[01:41:01.375 --> 01:41:02.315]  Third Amendment says I can.
[01:41:02.715 --> 01:41:03.036]  I will.
[01:41:03.096 --> 01:41:04.156]  A man home is his castle.
[01:41:04.196 --> 01:41:05.737]  If I have to die proving that, so be it.
[01:41:06.177 --> 01:41:11.180]  And how many folks, are there more, just a minute, are there more and more people interested in the militia now?
[01:41:14.242 --> 01:41:15.623]  Let me give you a general gist of it.
[01:41:16.083 --> 01:41:18.745]  A year and a half ago there was not a heck of a lot.
[01:41:19.225 --> 01:41:22.770]  And some of us were out there trying to let people know what was going on.
[01:41:23.191 --> 01:41:30.921]  Right now, across the United States, we calculate active members meeting probably in a neighborhood of 10 million.
[01:41:30.941 --> 01:41:31.482]  How's that, Greg?
[01:41:31.542 --> 01:41:32.504]  Nah, nah, nah.
[01:41:32.584 --> 01:41:33.525]  Okay, fine.
[01:41:33.605 --> 01:41:34.226]  Hang on a minute.
[01:41:34.366 --> 01:41:34.646]  Sure.
[01:41:34.686 --> 01:41:35.607]  Just hang on a second.
[01:41:35.647 --> 01:41:37.528]  Boy, I'll tell you, you and your charts here.
[01:41:37.988 --> 01:41:41.410]  Bob Fletcher and John Trotman are from Montana.
[01:41:41.450 --> 01:41:42.230]  I'll give you a chance.
[01:41:43.411 --> 01:41:52.836]  Yes, they do feel that the Bill of Rights is being eroded, that protections of privacy are being undermined in the name of the law.
[01:41:53.236 --> 01:41:54.737]  They love their local sheriff.
[01:41:55.197 --> 01:41:56.398]  Let me tell you about my sheriff.
[01:41:56.418 --> 01:41:57.179]  I'm right here on your knees.
[01:42:11.829 --> 01:42:23.678]  The sheriff in my county has told me that if he comes to my house, he will show me a warrant, his officers will identify themselves, and I will be more than happy to allow them to come into my house.
[01:42:24.258 --> 01:42:26.800]  They treat me as a human being with respect.
[01:42:26.820 --> 01:42:27.541]  What will the feds do?
[01:42:27.561 --> 01:42:38.149]  When we have a government that is on the verge of being completely out of control, they allow tyrants to come in with hooded masks on, unidentified,
[01:42:40.014 --> 01:42:41.235]  Bust down your door.
[01:42:42.035 --> 01:42:44.096]  It's happened all over America.
[01:42:45.077 --> 01:42:46.818]  And we're going to all say that's okay.
[01:42:46.878 --> 01:42:48.519]  Our neighbor wasn't any good anyways.
[01:42:48.539 --> 01:42:54.362]  In other words, the local or the federal agent, you're saying, often wears a mask.
[01:42:54.542 --> 01:42:57.544]  And they don't even let your sheriff know that they're doing it.
[01:42:57.584 --> 01:43:01.827]  When he shoots your kid sister, nobody's going to know who it is because he's got a mask.
[01:43:02.147 --> 01:43:05.909]  And this is the one world government coming down on you.
[01:43:05.989 --> 01:43:07.210]  First they take your taxes.
[01:43:08.050 --> 01:43:09.271]  Then they take your privacy.
[01:43:09.711 --> 01:43:13.513]  Then they take all the power away from the local sheriff, from the local police department.
[01:43:13.573 --> 01:43:20.656]  Phil, if we were on stage without ID cards or without names and masks, would that be a concern of yours?
[01:43:20.696 --> 01:43:20.856]  Yeah.
[01:43:20.896 --> 01:43:23.397]  Why isn't it a concern with the federal government?
[01:43:24.218 --> 01:43:26.779]  These are undercover narcs, they don't want to be caught.
[01:43:26.959 --> 01:43:30.240]  Why is the sheriff not afraid?
[01:43:30.421 --> 01:43:37.204]  Half of the undercover narcs are the ones who brought the dope in 90 days earlier and using it now as an excuse.
[01:43:38.004 --> 01:43:40.547]  This, this guy, what's wrong with this picture?
[01:43:40.807 --> 01:43:45.892]  When you were a kid, when you were a kid, your mother told you go to the friendly policeman if you got lost.
[01:43:46.173 --> 01:43:49.276]  Can you imagine sending your kid to this yahoo over here?
[01:43:49.316 --> 01:43:50.317]  Yeah, how much time we got?
[01:43:50.377 --> 01:43:50.677]  Okay.
[01:43:50.717 --> 01:43:52.840]  How much time we got, you figure, before the yahoos come?
[01:43:53.587 --> 01:43:59.454]  I'll give you a chance to answer that.
[01:43:59.654 --> 01:44:06.241]  I ask you a three ounce question, I get a ten pound answer here.
[01:44:06.502 --> 01:44:07.763]  How much time have we got?
[01:44:08.824 --> 01:44:10.504]  What time have we got?
[01:44:10.624 --> 01:44:16.605]  The Grace Commission in 1984 told us that by 1996, the economic collapse, the economic progress.
[01:44:16.625 --> 01:44:19.806]  So we're gonna go down and anarchy's gonna ensue and you're the guys that are gonna be ready.
[01:44:20.066 --> 01:44:22.306]  And you're gonna help protect me, I think you're saying.
[01:44:22.346 --> 01:44:23.687]  Yes you can, you really can.
[01:44:23.807 --> 01:44:24.467]  I'll give you a chance.
[01:44:24.507 --> 01:44:26.087]  That's law enforcement right there, okay?
[01:44:26.107 --> 01:44:28.147]  They're wearing hoods, they're legal, they're protecting the law.
[01:44:28.167 --> 01:44:28.667]  What's wrong with that?
[01:44:28.687 --> 01:44:31.368]  We're out here in the open, we identify ourselves and they're saying we're illegal?
[01:44:32.348 --> 01:44:36.689]  This is the new thing in America, as recently reported on the front page of the New York Times.
[01:44:38.188 --> 01:44:39.108]  It's called the militia.
[01:44:40.329 --> 01:44:41.609]  No, they say they're not racist.
[01:44:42.149 --> 01:44:46.471]  It's not just about guns and possession of guns, but the Second Amendment is involved here, definitely.
[01:44:46.811 --> 01:44:48.012]  They're proud of their Second Amendment.
[01:44:48.592 --> 01:44:49.692]  It's about provisions.
[01:44:49.732 --> 01:44:51.373]  It's about protecting your neighbor.
[01:44:51.393 --> 01:44:51.873]  They're neighbors.
[01:44:51.913 --> 01:44:53.354]  They feel like they're together.
[01:44:53.374 --> 01:44:53.954]  They're going to help.
[01:44:54.724 --> 01:45:00.088]  And by God, no constable's gonna come from some far away place and break their door down.
[01:45:00.368 --> 01:45:01.248]  They'll shoot him first.
[01:45:01.489 --> 01:45:02.810]  No, I didn't say that!
[01:45:02.870 --> 01:45:03.010]  He did.
[01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:03.250]  He did.
[01:45:03.550 --> 01:45:05.331]  Wait a minute, talk about- He said it.
[01:45:05.792 --> 01:45:09.254]  I'll give you a chance to talk all you want when we come back in just a moment.
[01:45:39.257 --> 01:45:44.920]  You've met the good brother Doug Hall, member of the Michigan Militia.
[01:45:44.940 --> 01:45:49.463]  Okay, so you don't sleep in the woods, you maneuver in the woods.
[01:45:49.563 --> 01:45:54.005]  And you say Michigan is quite wooded, especially the northern part.
[01:45:54.525 --> 01:45:56.286]  Here's the Reverend speaking to the troops.
[01:45:56.366 --> 01:45:59.348]  I guess this is a weekend gathering for... Go get them, Reverend.
[01:45:59.528 --> 01:46:00.429]  Praise the Lord.
[01:46:01.229 --> 01:46:06.492]  I felt that the Lord was saying, this is this group.
[01:46:07.870 --> 01:46:11.153]  Because, you know, the way it's growing across the nation is phenomenal.
[01:46:11.353 --> 01:46:13.835]  I go to staff meetings and can't believe what I hear is going on.
[01:46:15.336 --> 01:46:21.621]  But I felt like the Lord is saying, this is the army of the Lord in the United States for this moment.
[01:46:24.277 --> 01:46:25.558]  That's the army of the Lord, is it?
[01:46:26.258 --> 01:46:27.338]  That's the army of the Lord.
[01:46:27.838 --> 01:46:28.298]  Yeah.
[01:46:28.799 --> 01:46:31.980]  Well, that's the army I want to be in.
[01:46:32.780 --> 01:46:36.561]  I don't want to laugh at these people, but I feel that they're all weird.
[01:46:37.201 --> 01:46:39.422]  But I don't think it's that bad.
[01:46:40.042 --> 01:46:44.324]  And as for him saying he's religious and it's an army of the Lord, it's something else.
[01:46:44.384 --> 01:46:45.784]  And I don't think it's that serious.
[01:46:45.864 --> 01:46:46.964]  I don't think it's that bad.
[01:46:47.465 --> 01:46:50.205]  And I would like to know if they plan on maybe taking over the government.
[01:46:50.265 --> 01:46:51.526]  Maybe do like they did in Haiti.
[01:46:51.926 --> 01:46:52.667]  You know what?
[01:46:52.747 --> 01:46:54.249]  The problem is... We are the government.
[01:46:54.289 --> 01:46:55.631]  The same as you're the government.
[01:46:55.651 --> 01:46:56.572]  You are the government.
[01:46:56.792 --> 01:46:59.436]  And the problem is who did take over Haiti, ma'am?
[01:46:59.776 --> 01:47:01.639]  Who took over Haiti a couple of weeks ago?
[01:47:01.659 --> 01:47:03.641]  No, I'm talking about the... No, no.
[01:47:03.701 --> 01:47:04.683]  Who took over Haiti?
[01:47:04.723 --> 01:47:05.444]  You mentioned it.
[01:47:05.644 --> 01:47:06.665]  You know who took over Haiti?
[01:47:06.966 --> 01:47:08.588]  An out-of-control government.
[01:47:08.948 --> 01:47:25.394]  They did not do anything other than go to some unknown entity called the United Nations, has nothing to do with your representative, congressional representative, and went in there and just took them over and stuck who they wanted in there, who, by the way, is now a dope-drop operation in between South America.
[01:47:25.414 --> 01:47:28.335]  You keep giving us lectures about world events.
[01:47:28.775 --> 01:47:30.756]  We want to know about this, Bob.
[01:47:30.776 --> 01:47:31.456]  You understand that?
[01:47:31.736 --> 01:47:33.377]  We want to know what motivates you.
[01:47:33.417 --> 01:47:34.798]  Hey, I want to say something on this.
[01:47:34.818 --> 01:47:37.800]  I guess I'm going to army of A. Because we took it all out of you.
[01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:39.180]  Hey, A is for horses, Reverend.
[01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:40.201]  Oh, well, I've been straw.
[01:47:40.241 --> 01:47:40.421]  Whatever.
[01:47:40.441 --> 01:47:40.621]  Listen.
[01:47:40.641 --> 01:47:41.202]  Go ahead, Reverend.
[01:47:41.242 --> 01:47:42.822]  Go ahead.
[01:47:42.863 --> 01:47:48.766]  This was taken out of context.
[01:47:48.786 --> 01:47:50.707]  None of these bites is taken out of context.
[01:47:51.147 --> 01:47:53.128]  I set the condition, number one.
[01:47:53.729 --> 01:47:58.912]  I told these militiamen, if you are going to be the army of the Lord, you better be living right in your own homes.
[01:48:00.453 --> 01:48:03.154]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, that is that.
[01:48:03.434 --> 01:48:05.074]  But there's more of that online.
[01:48:05.934 --> 01:48:08.415]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:48:08.455 --> 01:48:09.455]  But look at their courage.
[01:48:09.475 --> 01:48:10.395]  Look how they're bold.
[01:48:10.435 --> 01:48:19.158]  Look how upright they were being attacked by that lesser man who was laughing and mocking them with that mindless group of people pilloring them and booing them and laughing at them.
[01:48:19.178 --> 01:48:24.419]  And a lot of these guys got set up, went to prison, had pipe bombs buried on their property, hundreds of them.
[01:48:25.079 --> 01:48:28.420]  Feds infiltrated, tried to begin to be violent, never worked.
[01:48:30.625 --> 01:48:36.547]  Just amazing people, everything that they've done, and all I can do is commend the American militia.
[01:48:37.267 --> 01:48:41.869]  And it's in the Second Amendment, all men 18 to 49 are supposed to be part of it, 18 to 44.
[01:48:42.769 --> 01:48:47.591]  And instead we've got illegal aliens and foreign felons making up a lot of our military now.
[01:48:47.911 --> 01:48:53.293]  We can't have the citizens involved in saying we'll defend our local governments and communities against corporate tyranny.
[01:48:54.193 --> 01:49:00.977]  But you can have aggravated felons in your military and illegal aliens in them, and if you didn't know folks that were recruiting them, you're blind to that.
[01:49:01.037 --> 01:49:02.658]  But just everything they're saying has come true.
[01:49:02.958 --> 01:49:03.819]  Everything they warned.
[01:49:04.259 --> 01:49:08.162]  And they deserve the respect of the people.
[01:49:08.942 --> 01:49:11.684]  As I said, we're going to go into retransmission now.
[01:49:11.724 --> 01:49:16.707]  Let me just go another two, three minutes, and we'll just come right out when the show comes back out of rebroadcast.
[01:49:17.507 --> 01:49:19.730]  It's usually about 30 seconds ahead on the internet refeed, so at T-324.30.
[01:49:19.750 --> 01:49:21.672]  I will end this transmission.
[01:49:29.144 --> 01:49:33.707]  There was some news I didn't get to today, as well, that I needed to get to.
[01:49:34.007 --> 01:49:39.350]  This story about, clearly, globalist-backed forces trying to bomb and kill the new Pakistan government.
[01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:42.251]  They're saying Al-Qaeda was behind it.
[01:49:42.631 --> 01:49:47.394]  Al-Qaeda always attacking the New World Order's enemies, the little dutiful creatures.
[01:49:48.295 --> 01:49:49.795]  The sun is going crazy.
[01:49:51.164 --> 01:49:52.826]  I meant to get to that.
[01:49:52.866 --> 01:49:56.310]  In financial news, dollar may get crushed as traders weigh up bailout.
[01:49:56.350 --> 01:49:57.351]  That's mainstream news.
[01:49:57.391 --> 01:49:57.932]  Bloomberg.
[01:49:58.212 --> 01:50:00.715]  Bloomberg also reports Bush now has dictatorial powers.
[01:50:00.735 --> 01:50:01.476]  That's a headline.
[01:50:02.256 --> 01:50:05.820]  Fairy godmother taxpayer face funding, 200 billion pound.
[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:07.342]  That's 400 billion British bailout.
[01:50:07.362 --> 01:50:10.145]  400 billion in US dollars.
[01:50:10.566 --> 01:50:11.787]  Bailout of greedy bankers.
[01:50:13.033 --> 01:50:14.094]  It goes on and on.
[01:50:14.154 --> 01:50:17.977]  Where is my story about the sun?
[01:50:18.838 --> 01:50:21.120]  Because now that I... and I forgot all the callers, too.
[01:50:21.981 --> 01:50:23.322]  I mean to take more calls on the show.
[01:50:23.362 --> 01:50:26.365]  I just get stuck in covering news.
[01:50:26.385 --> 01:50:31.429]  You know, that's cell phones giving kids five times the rate of brain tumors, hundreds of studies.
[01:50:31.589 --> 01:50:32.189]  No.
[01:50:33.851 --> 01:50:37.094]  That's forced drugging of children in schools to make them smarter.
[01:50:37.194 --> 01:50:38.475]  Can't make that up.
[01:50:40.529 --> 01:50:43.610]  Again, you just cannot make this stuff up.
[01:50:44.210 --> 01:50:44.950]  It's so crazy.
[01:50:46.171 --> 01:50:46.711]  NASA.
[01:50:47.491 --> 01:50:48.511]  This is from the NASA.
[01:50:49.211 --> 01:50:51.672]  NASA to hold press conference on the state of the sun.
[01:50:52.392 --> 01:50:59.654]  The sun in 300 years being measured has never been this cool or releasing this low level of heat.
[01:50:59.834 --> 01:51:04.916]  It's one of the most and most early studied things by scientists and they've had accurate readings for 300 years or more.
[01:51:07.256 --> 01:51:09.897]  NASA will hold a media conference Tuesday, September 23rd.
[01:51:09.917 --> 01:51:16.941]  It's tomorrow to discuss the data from the joint NASA-European Space Agency Ulysses missions reveal the solar wind, the 50-year low.
[01:51:17.361 --> 01:51:24.325]  Then it goes deeper into the articles, say 300 years of measurements, but since they've been measuring solar winds, it's the 50-year low.
[01:51:24.565 --> 01:51:27.507]  The sun's current state could result in changing conditions in the solar system.
[01:51:28.052 --> 01:51:30.555]  Yeah, and it gets into all that, so I'll be covering that tomorrow.
[01:51:31.016 --> 01:51:34.200]  Retransmission starts now on the InfoWars.com streams.
[01:51:34.220 --> 01:51:36.744]  I want to thank everybody for spreading the word about the radio show.
[01:51:36.824 --> 01:51:40.048]  That's how we reach more people, and that's our goal, is to be able to warn them.
[01:51:40.368 --> 01:51:41.370]  God bless you all!
