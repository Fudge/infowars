[00:00:27.646 --> 00:00:28.106]  EO 590 KLVJ.
[00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:35.440]  IRN USA Radio News, I'm Jody Jordan.
[00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:42.123]  Congress and the Bush Administration are close to a deal on a Wall Street bailout to keep the nation's shaky economy from collapsing.
[00:00:42.603 --> 00:00:48.566]  Announcing a tentative agreement shortly after midnight, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says they've made great progress.
[00:00:49.186 --> 00:00:51.367]  This is House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer.
[00:00:51.547 --> 00:00:53.368]  What if negotiations fall through?
[00:00:53.388 --> 00:00:55.189]  What if we fail to act?
[00:00:56.312 --> 00:00:59.836]  If we fail, every American could be adversely affected.
[00:01:00.077 --> 00:01:06.304]  Maryland State Police Superintendent Terrence Sheridan says a medevac helicopter has crashed in Maryland.
[00:01:06.324 --> 00:01:16.476]  It's with the deepest regret that I announce the deaths of four people who were aboard a Maryland State Police medevac helicopter that crashed earlier this morning in Prince George's County.
[00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:25.669]  A paramedic, an emergency responder, and one of the two accident victims were killed when the copter crashed around midnight in a suburban park after reporting bad weather.
[00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.113]  This is IRN USA Radio News.
[00:01:29.688 --> 00:01:37.234]  If you're driving down the road trying to decide whether you need a home equity loan just to buy gas, you might want to consider a home business.
[00:01:37.434 --> 00:01:39.216]  Hi, how in the world are you anyway?
[00:01:39.276 --> 00:01:43.219]  This is Andy Willoughby with the 3-Step Plan Home Business System.
[00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:47.602]  If you build a home business with the 3-Step Plan, you'd walk to work every day.
[00:01:47.902 --> 00:01:51.165]  It'd only take about 10 seconds and it wouldn't use any gas.
[00:01:51.545 --> 00:01:54.968]  And you probably wouldn't miss all the traffic hassles either.
[00:01:55.308 --> 00:02:00.049]  Of course, some 3-Step Plan members keep their job and just start a home business part-time.
[00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:00.869]  It's up to you.
[00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.590]  That's one of the great things about the 3-Step Plan.
[00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.210]  You get to make the choices.

[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:39.686]  Maine could see wind gusts up to 60 miles per hour and waves up to 20 feet from Hurricane Kyle according to the state's emergency management agency director.
[00:02:40.227 --> 00:02:47.712]  The storm has triggered Maine's first hurricane watch in 17 years as it roars over the Atlantic on a northward track toward Nova Scotia.
[00:02:48.357 --> 00:02:51.038]  Stacy Stewart is with the National Hurricane Center.
[00:02:51.138 --> 00:02:56.599]  Kyle is still a Category 1 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of around 75 miles per hour.
[00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:03.841]  And we expect little change in the overall strength of this system for the next 12 to maybe 24 hours.
[00:03:05.341 --> 00:03:16.364]  Sounds from China where people in mission control clap as Chinese Shenzhou 7 spacecraft arrives back on Earth following its successful attempt at the country's first ever spacewalk.
[00:03:17.154 --> 00:03:23.647]  Astronauts called it a glorious mission, and the premier calls it a stride forward in China's space history.

[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.821]  The Phillies are the National League East champions.
[00:04:03.321 --> 00:04:04.561]  Here's Michael Luongo.
[00:04:04.881 --> 00:04:11.403]  The Phillies captured their second consecutive National League Eastern Division championship with a 4-3 victory over the Nationals.
[00:04:11.743 --> 00:04:18.745]  But off he got sacrifice flies from Pat Burrell and Carlos Ruiz in the fourth, a solo home run by Jason Worth in the fifth.
[00:04:31.607 --> 00:04:36.508]  Two playoff spots are still open on this final scheduled day of the Major League Baseball season.
[00:04:36.888 --> 00:04:41.669]  The New York Mets and the Milwaukee Brewers are tied for the National League Wild Card.
[00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:47.750]  While the Chicago White Sox and Minnesota Twins are still battling for the American League Central title.
[00:04:48.502 --> 00:04:49.063]  The U.S.
[00:04:49.143 --> 00:04:54.630]  military has given Israel a sophisticated radar to track incoming Iranian missiles.
[00:04:55.251 --> 00:04:56.132]  Here's Mark Levy.
[00:04:56.292 --> 00:05:00.377]  It's a concrete sign of the level of seriousness of the threats of Iran against Israel.
[00:05:00.758 --> 00:05:03.381]  Iran's president keeps threatening to wipe Israel off the map.
[00:05:03.925 --> 00:05:07.367]  The new radar can spot an Iranian missile a thousand miles away.
[00:05:07.547 --> 00:05:10.928]  And Barack Obama and Joe Biden will be back in Michigan today.
[00:05:11.528 --> 00:05:15.250]  A recent poll suggests Obama has a commanding lead in the state.
[00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.472]  John McCain is joining ABC News for a town hall meeting in Columbus, Ohio.
[00:05:20.833 --> 00:05:22.553]  Sarah Palin has nothing scheduled.
[00:05:23.554 --> 00:05:28.176]  I'm Jody Jordan, and that's news from the Information Radio Network.
[00:05:30.352 --> 00:05:33.734]  Are you sick and tired of spending your hard-earned money to fill your gas tank?

[00:07:06.906 --> 00:07:11.147]  Here's Alex Jones.
[00:07:13.568 --> 00:07:36.014]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, as we close out the last few days of September on this live Sunday edition, going on across the country on the AM and FM dial, satellitetheinternetatinfowars.com and, of course, Global Shortwave, it is Sunday and we're very glad that you decided to spend some time with us.
[00:07:37.679 --> 00:07:49.954]  There are so many facets and angles and levels of deception to what is popularly known as the bailout, the financial bailout.
[00:07:50.896 --> 00:07:52.618]  Number one, it is not a bailout.
[00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:58.662]  It is a new branch of government being created, a new private branch.
[00:07:58.702 --> 00:08:19.930]  The Treasury becomes private, a private mega hedge fund slash central bank, and it gives complete and total criminal pardons to anyone who has committed any type of crime in the financial system if the Secretary of the Treasury says that that is the case.
[00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:30.217]  I mean, I'm hearing people all over talk radio finally waking up that George Bush isn't a good conservative and that George Bush is a puppet and runs absolutely nothing.
[00:08:30.237 --> 00:08:31.378]  They're also waking up to that.
[00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:38.824]  The left is waking up as well, but only to one layer of the proverbial onion.
[00:08:39.784 --> 00:08:43.227]  Only to a small fraction of it.
[00:08:44.288 --> 00:08:49.993]  Bloomberg Financial, of all places, has been reporting that the bailout is more like five trillion dollars.
[00:08:52.596 --> 00:08:59.559]  Also, Bloomberg is reporting today that the banks are faking a liquidity crisis.
[00:09:00.079 --> 00:09:01.060]  Well, of course they are.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:12.405]  They're the authors of this massive fraud, and the whole point of the Ponzi scheme is to fleece the schmucks as much as you can.
[00:09:15.926 --> 00:09:16.967]  So we'll get into that.
[00:09:17.327 --> 00:09:19.388]  Also, it's a red herring.
[00:09:20.909 --> 00:09:21.669]  A big red herring.
[00:09:22.717 --> 00:09:29.600]  There has been close to a trillion dollars pumped into banks, that is U.S.
[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:35.903]  taxpayer money, in the last year and a half since this crisis supposedly started.
[00:09:35.923 --> 00:09:37.704]  A contrived stage crisis.
[00:09:37.724 --> 00:09:41.126]  We told you several years before that, that they would stage the crisis.
[00:09:41.166 --> 00:09:47.129]  We even mentioned it would be in subprime mortgages because we actually happen to track the global elite and what they're up to.
[00:09:50.564 --> 00:09:59.711]  But just in the last week, Reuters reports an average of $188 billion per day.
[00:10:01.332 --> 00:10:03.293]  This came out Friday night from Reuters.
[00:10:03.373 --> 00:10:07.837]  Steve Watson did a great report up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.net on it.
[00:10:09.058 --> 00:10:13.621]  Bank borrowing from Fed already exceeded bailout total in one week.
[00:10:13.641 --> 00:10:14.682]  $188 billion per day!
[00:10:19.204 --> 00:10:35.852]  Meanwhile, they have you debating a $700 billion bailout to make you think you're part of the process, to confuse the simple-minded public that kind of halfway pays attention to things.
[00:10:35.872 --> 00:10:38.013]  Oh, do you want a $700 billion bailout?
[00:10:38.193 --> 00:10:39.874]  But that's a lie itself!
[00:10:41.335 --> 00:10:43.196]  This is a complete
[00:10:44.964 --> 00:10:55.308]  And total blank check to commit crimes in the future and a pardon for all of the crimes that have been committed in the past by the very private banks.
[00:10:56.268 --> 00:10:58.409]  You know, the international bankers we talk so much about.
[00:10:59.029 --> 00:11:06.312]  The public was trained, didn't exist, and was trained to giggle and smirk at in the New World Order as presidents and prime ministers called for it.
[00:11:08.092 --> 00:11:09.473]  You were taught it didn't exist.
[00:11:10.362 --> 00:11:16.309]  So that you wouldn't have to use your feeble little minds to think about it in the words of the New World Order, not in my words.
[00:11:16.809 --> 00:11:21.654]  They call you cattle, they call you slaves, they write books about how stupid you are, laughing at you.
[00:11:23.096 --> 00:11:28.822]  Bank borrowing from Fed already exceeded bailout total in last week, so you're debating that.
[00:11:29.978 --> 00:11:30.218]  U.S.
[00:11:30.258 --> 00:11:42.866]  banks borrowed $188 billion per day on average in the last week from the Federal Reserve, meaning that the Fed loaned out more than the Treasury's proposed bailout in just one week, still barely managing to keep the economy afloat.
[00:11:44.647 --> 00:11:46.788]  That is long enough to fully suck all the blood out.
[00:11:47.449 --> 00:11:55.174]  Federal Reserve data showed Thursday the total amount banks borrowed nearly quadrupled from the previous $47.97 billion per day
[00:11:57.967 --> 00:12:01.488]  Not just the week before Reuters reports.
[00:12:01.728 --> 00:12:17.094]  $188 billion per day on average over the course of five days means the total amount borrowed from the Fed in the week ending the 24th of September stood at $940 billion in one week.
[00:12:17.394 --> 00:12:21.555]  And they count it Sunday night through Thursday evening is how the banking numbers work.
[00:12:21.935 --> 00:12:25.016]  A figure that easily eclipsed the proposed $700 billion bailout.
[00:12:25.356 --> 00:12:26.617]  That is a smokescreen!
[00:12:28.041 --> 00:12:30.882]  Sunday, last Sunday, seven days ago, they met in secret.
[00:12:32.302 --> 00:12:39.704]  The private Federal Reserve heads, their puppet, the head of Goldman Sachs, stealing hundreds of billions a day for his company, openly.
[00:12:40.285 --> 00:12:41.505]  Total conflict of interest.
[00:12:41.965 --> 00:12:46.806]  They met and then Monday we got the plan and it said, clearly, no one can investigate this.
[00:12:47.087 --> 00:12:48.187]  No one can even look at this.
[00:12:48.267 --> 00:12:49.507]  No one can talk about this.
[00:12:49.907 --> 00:12:51.588]  Any crimes, any felonies.
[00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:55.312]  You are given total immunity and perpetuity.
[00:12:55.352 --> 00:12:56.053]  It says it!
[00:12:56.833 --> 00:12:58.314]  Go read it, it's all over the news.
[00:13:00.396 --> 00:13:05.540]  It said they can seize your houses, seize any infrastructure they want, they can take over any banks they want.
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.121]  Oh, that's another...
[00:13:07.265 --> 00:13:08.085]  Wrinkled the scam.
[00:13:08.125 --> 00:13:17.109]  It allows this central coterie, this select group of criminal bankers to use federal regulators to go grab Washington Mutual, the biggest bank to fail in U.S.
[00:13:17.149 --> 00:13:17.489]  history.
[00:13:17.729 --> 00:13:18.969]  Biggest in world history, by the way.
[00:13:19.449 --> 00:13:20.030]  Not just U.S.
[00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:20.370]  history.
[00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:21.650]  They go and grab that.
[00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:22.871]  They grab whatever they want.
[00:13:23.071 --> 00:13:25.052]  They pay whatever they want for the assets.
[00:13:25.332 --> 00:13:26.752]  They steal your assets.
[00:13:26.792 --> 00:13:27.352]  They do it.
[00:13:27.592 --> 00:13:29.033]  It's just mass criminality.
[00:13:30.213 --> 00:13:31.574]  So there's that going on, too.
[00:13:32.546 --> 00:13:40.130]  And, uh, never forget that in the last week they stole nine hundred plus billion.
[00:13:42.231 --> 00:13:49.274]  Nine hundred plus billion, and they've got you talking about seven hundred billion.
[00:13:49.534 --> 00:13:53.936]  Which, if you really read it, it's at least five trillion conservatively.
[00:13:54.897 --> 00:13:57.738]  At least five trillion conservatively.
[00:13:58.999 --> 00:14:06.061]  So see, you got the public going, that's it, I'm not bailing them out for $700 billion, I'm putting my foot down right now!
[00:14:06.881 --> 00:14:15.204]  I hear it all over talk radio, I'm going to start this and that, I'm going to start blasting, I'm going to start... I hear it on Mainline, I hear it on Rush Limbaugh, people talking about shooting.
[00:14:15.684 --> 00:14:18.405]  I heard people talking about it on Sean Hannity, I heard it everywhere.
[00:14:19.125 --> 00:14:22.006]  And suddenly, it's being accepted.
[00:14:22.266 --> 00:14:27.988]  No, we don't need behavior like that, and sit down and realize really what's going on.
[00:14:29.068 --> 00:14:44.119]  While you're busy looking at the puppet they held up in front of you, or the red cape they held up in front of you, like you're some mindless bovine bull, some beast, nine hundred plus billion was stolen.
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.562]  Now that's Reuters reporting that.
[00:14:49.143 --> 00:14:50.183]  That's what's been taken out.
[00:14:51.785 --> 00:14:53.186]  Now, on top of this,
[00:14:55.183 --> 00:14:56.505]  I mean, there's just so many facets.
[00:14:56.525 --> 00:14:57.706]  It's just amazing.
[00:14:58.247 --> 00:15:13.003]  While everybody's been busy watching this happen, and they've doubtedly agreed on the bloodletting, which is $5 trillion, not $700 billion, close to a trillion stolen just last week, that you will pay for with interest,
[00:15:14.426 --> 00:15:21.571]  The Democrats just dropped a tiny little bit of socialism for the people, which I would normally be against, but compared to the stuff for the bankers, it's nothing.
[00:15:21.972 --> 00:15:30.718]  You know, that just maybe a judge might give you a chance to renegotiate, or you might get a little bit of aid somehow, at least a pat on the head as you were thrown off the cliff.
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:35.642]  No, you get absolutely nothing.
[00:15:35.662 --> 00:15:36.682]  That's Associated Press.
[00:15:36.722 --> 00:15:39.885]  Dems dropped mortgage help for homeowners from banker bailout.
[00:15:40.988 --> 00:15:44.509]  And yes, ladies and gentlemen, they passed the biggest U.S.
[00:15:44.549 --> 00:15:49.631]  defense budget, over $1 trillion with almost no fanfare.
[00:15:49.991 --> 00:15:53.793]  Just seven years ago, the defense budget was $430-something billion.
[00:15:54.113 --> 00:15:59.695]  Now it's over a trillion dollars, not to mention another $500 billion off the military budget.
[00:15:59.995 --> 00:16:01.096]  A trillion and a half!
[00:16:01.616 --> 00:16:03.777]  The military budget is now half the U.S.
[00:16:03.817 --> 00:16:04.757]  GDP a year.
[00:16:07.233 --> 00:16:13.138]  And it only expands, it only intensifies, it's only growing that much faster.
[00:16:14.539 --> 00:16:20.824]  So we'll come back and run over all the facts and how if you don't like it, they're going to use the military and police on you.
[00:16:21.044 --> 00:16:23.486]  That's what the police state was geared up for, as I told you years ago.
[00:16:23.847 --> 00:16:26.949]  So you can't stop them from taking your pension fund.
[00:16:27.029 --> 00:16:27.670]  We'll be right back.
[00:16:31.468 --> 00:16:32.508]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:16:32.909 --> 00:16:38.390]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:39.471]  That's right.
[00:16:39.791 --> 00:16:42.071]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:16:43.472 --> 00:16:49.554]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:16:50.114 --> 00:16:57.799]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:16:58.239 --> 00:17:03.102]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:17:03.722 --> 00:17:08.746]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:17:09.546 --> 00:17:13.669]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:14.309]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:16.150]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:17:19.392 --> 00:17:19.652]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:17:19.672 --> 00:17:19.873]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:17:31.522 --> 00:17:33.423]  We live in a world of vanishing privacy.
[00:17:33.663 --> 00:17:41.188]  The added threat of invisible radio waves sending out personal information to anyone willing to receive them makes our privacy as citizens even less secure.
[00:17:41.508 --> 00:17:44.990]  The RFID tags and ID cards have been proven to be not secure.
[00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:48.953]  Thieves are able to read information stored on these tags to steal your identity.
[00:17:49.433 --> 00:17:54.736]  Protect yourself from ID theft with our RFID blocker, available as a wallet or passport case.
[00:17:56.357 --> 00:17:58.578]  ProSpy.com offers simple, affordable personal protection.
[00:17:58.978 --> 00:18:03.019]  Many countries, including the U.S., have begun to institute RFID and passports.
[00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:04.180]  Why take a chance?
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.281]  This is your personal information.
[00:18:06.441 --> 00:18:07.201]  Protect yourself.

[00:18:30.063 --> 00:18:34.344]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:18:34.584 --> 00:18:39.485]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:18:39.685 --> 00:18:41.086]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:18:41.186 --> 00:18:44.666]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[00:19:03.794 --> 00:19:04.754]  No harsh chemicals.
[00:19:04.994 --> 00:19:05.915]  No animal testing.
[00:19:06.175 --> 00:19:07.476]  I use them and love them.
[00:19:07.516 --> 00:19:09.097]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[00:19:09.397 --> 00:19:10.498]  And I say big time.
[00:19:10.818 --> 00:19:12.399]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[00:19:12.519 --> 00:19:12.879]  That's 1-800-340-7091.

[00:19:29.582 --> 00:19:36.468]  Drink and Mate proudly presents another mind-boggling episode of America's toughest quiz show, That's Too Complicated!
[00:19:36.809 --> 00:19:42.434]  Let's see if we can figure out which contestant got the intellectual edge after an evening of partying by using Drink and Mate!
[00:19:42.554 --> 00:19:50.060]  For 20 points in the wind, Milt, Glur-5 and blank kinate receptor subunits in hippocampal neurons co-assemble to form functional receptors.
[00:19:50.421 --> 00:19:51.602]  Uh, uh, Pony?
[00:19:52.923 --> 00:19:53.924]  Oh, too bad!
[00:19:54.424 --> 00:19:54.965]  Yes, Chip!
[00:19:55.692 --> 00:19:58.275]  The illogical companion of Glur 5, Glur 6.
[00:19:59.377 --> 00:20:00.418]  You've won the game!
[00:20:00.718 --> 00:20:02.060]  Hey, life is like a game.
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.923]  And if you want to win, you've got to give it your best every day.
[00:20:05.064 --> 00:20:08.428]  Which doesn't always happen after an evening of celebrating with friends and family.
[00:20:08.628 --> 00:20:12.693]  That's why there's Drink and Mate, a patented formula of guava leaf extract.
[00:20:12.793 --> 00:20:15.174]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:45.872]  Okay, we are back live.
[00:20:46.892 --> 00:20:50.055]  I've got Webster Tarpley joining us.
[00:20:51.597 --> 00:20:53.738]  Immediately, Friday night, I thought of him.
[00:20:53.759 --> 00:20:57.502]  Author, researcher, political scientist.
[00:20:59.406 --> 00:21:14.796]  When I saw news reports out of Illinois, out of Missouri, out of other areas, confirming what he predicted like a year ago, when Barack Obama was still a little known, he was saying Barack Obama will be their candidate, he will bring in fascism to the U.S.
[00:21:14.856 --> 00:21:19.038]  And, you know, Tarpley's more of a progressive leftist, so he doesn't like to be put in boxes.
[00:21:19.759 --> 00:21:25.883]  And then just everything he said about it keeps coming true, and now they're arresting people that criticize Barack Obama.
[00:21:26.503 --> 00:21:27.824]  You cannot make this up.
[00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:30.003]  You cannot make this up.
[00:21:30.064 --> 00:21:30.407]  In fact...
[00:21:31.284 --> 00:21:36.485]  We have the stories up on Infowars.com right now for anyone that is doubting me.
[00:21:36.505 --> 00:21:38.426]  And I do want to get the Missouri Governor on.
[00:21:38.926 --> 00:21:40.566]  He is calling it a police state.
[00:21:41.026 --> 00:21:46.328]  He is calling it just the most egregious form of tyranny he's ever seen in the United States.
[00:21:47.108 --> 00:21:56.190]  Missouri Governor Matt Blunt, it's on the front page of the Governor's website, says Matt Blunt today issued the following statement on news reports that have exposed plans by U.S.
[00:21:56.230 --> 00:22:00.451]  Senator Barack Obama to use Missouri law enforcement to threaten and intimidate his critics.
[00:22:01.411 --> 00:22:03.931]  And I didn't believe this Friday when I saw it on the news.
[00:22:04.892 --> 00:22:10.273]  I made phone calls to the Barack Obama campaign in three different states, and they said, yes!
[00:22:10.913 --> 00:22:16.274]  They said, if you basically criticize Barack Obama and we don't think it's accurate, we're going to have you arrested.
[00:22:16.854 --> 00:22:17.834]  You can't do that!
[00:22:18.034 --> 00:22:18.974]  It's the First Amendment.
[00:22:19.014 --> 00:22:27.535]  I mean, if you can claim some civil issue and go that route, but... And again, I'm not going to... I can't vote for John McCain.
[00:22:27.575 --> 00:22:30.596]  They're both puppets, but stuff like this, I mean...
[00:22:31.954 --> 00:22:39.927]  Just when I think it can't get any worse and more bizarre and crazy and they've got all these cops and prosecutors and DA's on these newscasts.
[00:22:39.947 --> 00:22:41.430]  I've got one of the clips I want to play later.
[00:22:42.216 --> 00:22:45.197]  Saying, oh yes, you're not allowed to talk bad about him, we'll arrest you.
[00:22:45.498 --> 00:22:48.279]  I mean, I'm living in total fruitcake land.
[00:22:48.339 --> 00:22:49.820]  That is not the American way.
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:55.062]  Homeland Security putting brain scanning cameras up now in major cities, not just airports.
[00:22:55.102 --> 00:22:55.903]  That isn't freedom.
[00:22:56.363 --> 00:22:59.384]  CPS kidnapping of over a million kids a year in the U.S.
[00:22:59.424 --> 00:23:00.425]  without due process.
[00:23:00.765 --> 00:23:01.985]  That's not the American way.
[00:23:02.966 --> 00:23:06.528]  Cops crawling out our ears just everywhere is not the American way.
[00:23:07.228 --> 00:23:09.009]  Open borders is not the American way.
[00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:11.150]  You know, it's hard to get out, but it's easy to get in.
[00:23:12.887 --> 00:23:14.109]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:15.872]  So that's coming up.
[00:23:17.194 --> 00:23:18.756]  I mean, it's really getting Twilight Zone.
[00:23:18.776 --> 00:23:26.709]  I thought it must have been some type of hoax or something, but no, the Barack Obama campaign is very proud of it and is signaling that this is the future of America.
[00:23:27.809 --> 00:23:45.385]  uh... so of course john mccain says he wants to use troops on the streets of america to fight crime there's gun confiscation going on in illinois using regular army the regular armies announced in army times are going to be patrolling the united states to quote deal with uh... rioters and then they say we hope we don't have to shoot u.s.
[00:23:45.445 --> 00:23:55.113]  citizens it looked at the country's going to hell in a handbasket like i always told you they were setting it up for but it's one thing to know they're setting up another thing to see it happening
[00:23:56.838 --> 00:23:59.979]  Let me be very calm here about the bailout and just walk through the facts here.
[00:24:01.119 --> 00:24:03.380]  A. It is not a financial bailout.
[00:24:05.821 --> 00:24:19.745]  The private Federal Reserve that took over our government in 1913 issues the liquidity and issues trillions of dollars of it to their own private companies.
[00:24:20.305 --> 00:24:24.967]  The private shareholders that own the private Federal Reserve have issued tens of trillions of dollars
[00:24:26.323 --> 00:24:36.492]  ...of liquidity over the last 80-something years, most of it ballooning here at the end, accelerating the amount they've given themselves as the value of the currencies devalued.
[00:24:36.893 --> 00:24:46.221]  And they bought up railways and infrastructure and mines and media companies and defense establishment and endowed all the major universities.
[00:24:47.322 --> 00:24:49.885]  That's what they've done for the last 80-plus years.
[00:24:50.922 --> 00:25:01.169]  Now they're at the final phase of just blowing the currency out, killing the currency, and then signing the American people contractually on to pay for that.
[00:25:01.869 --> 00:25:14.738]  They've already fenced the assets they bought, when the currency was still valuable, when the liquidity was still valuable, they fenced that into global infrastructure to set up and build and finance their world corporate government, known as the New World Order.
[00:25:16.232 --> 00:25:17.273]  And they brag about all this.
[00:25:17.333 --> 00:25:18.154]  All this is public.
[00:25:18.174 --> 00:25:19.195]  This is not even secret.
[00:25:19.235 --> 00:25:20.677]  It's just not going to be on your nightly news.
[00:25:20.797 --> 00:25:26.423]  But it's in all the policy papers and white papers and they literally write books laughing at you about it.
[00:25:27.343 --> 00:25:38.155]  Now, at the end of the Ponzi scheme, they need to give complete and total liability protection, amnesty, pardons, whatever term you want to use.
[00:25:41.394 --> 00:25:43.475]  In there, just like with the warrantless spying.
[00:25:43.515 --> 00:25:46.035]  Every count of it was felonies against the American people.
[00:25:46.055 --> 00:25:50.497]  They retroactively passed a law giving the government pardons for their crimes.
[00:25:51.897 --> 00:25:52.657]  It's called tyranny.
[00:25:53.098 --> 00:25:55.218]  And by the way, I didn't for looking for Al Ciaeta.
[00:25:55.278 --> 00:25:57.199]  They know where their own forces are, believe me.
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:03.101]  Now they've gotten up to this point and they spent 940 billion dollars last week.
[00:26:03.121 --> 00:26:05.541]  940 billion dollars of taxpayer money.
[00:26:05.561 --> 00:26:06.242]  940 billion dollars
[00:26:11.974 --> 00:26:14.076]  In lending, Monday through Friday.
[00:26:15.097 --> 00:26:22.823]  Now by lending, that is just liquidity created that you and I sign on to to pay for at the barrel of a gun.
[00:26:24.764 --> 00:26:26.185]  So that's the fact you need to know.
[00:26:26.245 --> 00:26:36.113]  So while they've got you distracted thinking about 700 billion and saying, I'll never pay that, I'm just gonna quit working and quit my job and I'm not gonna pay taxes anymore if they do that.
[00:26:36.954 --> 00:26:38.575]  They already stole close to a trillion.
[00:26:39.088 --> 00:26:43.229]  While you were busy being distracted by that, they put major sanctions on Iran.
[00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:58.074]  While you were busy talking about $700 billion bailout, which was really a $5 trillion one they're setting up, and total liability protection for themselves, and imperial power for the Department of the Treasury.
[00:27:00.157 --> 00:27:04.880]  They also passed a one trillion plus dollar defense budget.
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:09.383]  That is more than twice the size the defense budget was just six years ago.
[00:27:10.844 --> 00:27:12.625]  Over a trillion dollars.
[00:27:13.185 --> 00:27:19.489]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, there were also trillions in the military pension funds and investments.
[00:27:19.789 --> 00:27:21.090]  That has all been stolen.
[00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:22.191]  That's in the Associated Press.
[00:27:22.411 --> 00:27:25.733]  And the military says, we will not tell you where it went.
[00:27:27.176 --> 00:27:28.597]  By the way, we have the military.
[00:27:28.637 --> 00:27:30.537]  They basically say that to the Congress.
[00:27:31.157 --> 00:27:32.338]  Look, it's a dictatorship.
[00:27:32.658 --> 00:27:33.678]  NORTHCOM runs it.
[00:27:34.559 --> 00:27:37.220]  The military is there to guard the criminals.
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:38.260]  Period.
[00:27:39.961 --> 00:27:45.383]  I'm sorry to have to inform you, just like under Hitler, the military was hijacked and was used to guard the criminals there.
[00:27:45.983 --> 00:27:47.323]  I'm not attacking our military.
[00:27:47.423 --> 00:27:48.484]  Our military is gone.
[00:27:49.318 --> 00:27:58.483]  It'd be like if a hijacker took over a jumbo jet and, you know, somebody called in on their radio, hey, that plane's been hijacked, and they said, how dare you talk bad about American Airlines?
[00:27:58.503 --> 00:28:00.884]  And you're going, no, somebody hijacked it.
[00:28:01.424 --> 00:28:02.225]  It's a hijacker.
[00:28:02.705 --> 00:28:03.605]  It's the same thing here.
[00:28:05.106 --> 00:28:08.368]  So, are the big banks faking liquidity crisis?
[00:28:08.828 --> 00:28:12.550]  Bloomberg, Reuters, and others report that, yes, that is the case.
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:17.823]  So you can read those stories up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:28:18.304 --> 00:28:26.011]  Again, lawmakers reached a tentative bailout deal and the latest version of it, Secretary of Treasury Paulson
[00:28:26.753 --> 00:28:30.814]  Has absolute dictatorial power outside of the other three branches of government.
[00:28:31.095 --> 00:28:40.758]  It makes a new fourth branch of and by the bankers that has the power to levy fines, fees, grab homes, grab property, grab infrastructure, create work brigades.
[00:28:41.558 --> 00:28:46.660]  I mean, this is just absolute, the bankers bringing us into receivership.
[00:28:47.418 --> 00:28:49.659]  And it has nothing to do with propping up the economy.
[00:28:49.699 --> 00:28:54.220]  This is going to make it implode a hundred times worse when they finally fully implode it.
[00:28:54.780 --> 00:29:01.342]  And the real economy, that's our jobs, our life, not the financial system, is already being imploded right now.
[00:29:06.024 --> 00:29:09.405]  And of course the Dems drop mortgage help for home owners from Banker Bailout.
[00:29:09.445 --> 00:29:14.106]  Of course you get nothing but to pay for the men in black uniforms that are going to squeeze you by the throat.
[00:29:15.442 --> 00:29:19.290]  Hundreds of top economists urge Congress not to rush on rescue plans, say it's a fraud.
[00:29:19.931 --> 00:29:21.534]  But again, we'll cover that when we get back.
[00:29:21.554 --> 00:29:22.556]  Stay with me.
[00:29:29.617 --> 00:29:31.899]  Collectors, outdoor enthusiasts, survivalists.
[00:29:32.139 --> 00:29:35.762]  The Army-Navy store from your memory as a child is just that, a memory.
[00:29:35.882 --> 00:29:40.246]  But there is still one place to find everything from gas masks to ammo cans and find it cheap.
[00:29:40.406 --> 00:29:41.928]  MainMilitary.com.

[00:33:32.018 --> 00:33:34.178]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:34.939 --> 00:33:36.799]  Home to hard-hitting talk radio.
[00:33:43.724 --> 00:33:48.227]  Alright, Webster Tarpley is going to be with us for the balance of the show today to talk about several issues.
[00:33:48.347 --> 00:33:52.669]  We're going to get into what's happening with the economy, the controlled implosion.
[00:33:53.509 --> 00:34:01.774]  We're also going to talk about Barack Obama's supporters in law enforcement, no longer peace officers, saying, you basically criticized Barack Obama, we're going to arrest you.
[00:34:01.794 --> 00:34:04.295]  We've got a clip of that coming up in a moment.
[00:34:04.776 --> 00:34:07.397]  And I know we also have quite a few callers that are patiently holding.
[00:34:07.717 --> 00:34:10.499]  We'll also be taking your calls coming up in the next hour.
[00:34:10.519 --> 00:34:12.900]  You're welcome to hold until then, or call back later.
[00:34:14.761 --> 00:34:16.144]  There's another Bloomberg story here.
[00:34:16.244 --> 00:34:20.493]  Hundreds of economists urge Congress not to take a rush on rescue plan.
[00:34:21.403 --> 00:34:29.987]  We also have a former Nobel Prize winner for economics, Joseph Stiklitz, who exposed that this was a orchestrated plan when he left the IMF and World Bank in 2002.
[00:34:30.447 --> 00:34:33.309]  I interviewed him again about a week and a half ago.
[00:34:33.329 --> 00:34:34.729]  I interviewed Ron Paul earlier this week.
[00:34:35.249 --> 00:34:36.830]  Bailout failure will cause U.S.
[00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:37.691]  crash.
[00:34:38.051 --> 00:34:46.895]  So we have all these top economists saying it's a fraud, it's a scam, it's theft, it's making a new branch of government, it's literally letting the private banks
[00:34:48.015 --> 00:34:53.119]  Become government, but then they will use governmental power to shut down other financial institutions.
[00:34:53.579 --> 00:34:55.080]  So this is pure fascism.
[00:34:56.661 --> 00:34:58.783]  And what does both political parties do?
[00:34:59.243 --> 00:35:00.064]  There are polls.
[00:35:00.104 --> 00:35:06.268]  A week ago, Ross Mewson and others, Zogby, had polls of 28 to 30 percent for the bailout.
[00:35:07.009 --> 00:35:10.451]  Now we have polls that came out in the last two days as low as 5 percent.
[00:35:10.951 --> 00:35:12.793]  I have two different polls here that show 9 percent.
[00:35:14.119 --> 00:35:16.280]  And I'm sure you've seen those polls too, they've been all over the news.
[00:35:16.681 --> 00:35:32.650]  The point is, 9% support it, but magically almost every politician does, and they've got Nancy Pelosi, and they've got Paulson, and they've got Bush, and they've got Barack Obama, and John McCain, and Sarah Palin, and all of them.
[00:35:33.496 --> 00:35:37.520]  Up there agreeing that, oh, we've got to have this or a depression is going to hit.
[00:35:38.041 --> 00:35:41.825]  And then all these headlines like this today, bailout failure will cause U.S.
[00:35:41.885 --> 00:35:42.305]  crash.
[00:35:42.665 --> 00:35:43.166]  The U.S.
[00:35:43.226 --> 00:35:47.430]  stock market could suffer a devastating crash with shares losing a third of their value this week.
[00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:50.513]  If Hank Paulson's financial bailout plan fails, U.S.
[00:35:50.553 --> 00:35:52.155]  Treasury officials have warned.
[00:35:54.426 --> 00:35:58.714]  And so, meanwhile, again, there's wheels within wheels here.
[00:35:59.155 --> 00:36:00.337]  They did a $940 billion payout this week!
[00:36:00.357 --> 00:36:00.898]  That's Reuters!
[00:36:00.918 --> 00:36:03.342]  $940 billion out of the Treasury!
[00:36:08.607 --> 00:36:12.089]  Just made up, put on our backs, devaluing the currency.
[00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:14.971]  You think, on average, 15% inflation this year.
[00:36:14.991 --> 00:36:16.873]  It was 10% last year, now it's about 15%.
[00:36:17.313 --> 00:36:20.835]  Most economists I've talked to said it'll be about 20-30% next year.
[00:36:21.075 --> 00:36:22.256]  Compounded each year!
[00:36:22.276 --> 00:36:24.117]  Oh, what's that going to do to people on fixed incomes?
[00:36:24.357 --> 00:36:25.418]  Or anybody for that matter!
[00:36:26.999 --> 00:36:31.782]  And so remember when you're... You think inflation's been bad now with fuel and food?
[00:36:31.802 --> 00:36:31.962]  No, no, no.
[00:36:31.982 --> 00:36:33.443]  Wait until you get 20% compounded.
[00:36:33.503 --> 00:36:34.124]  Not just 10 or 15.
[00:36:38.374 --> 00:36:52.542]  So all of this is going on, but the biggest issue here is that even in the newest version, even in the latest version,
[00:36:56.784 --> 00:37:13.696]  They are talking about making the Federal Reserve, basically, and private bankers, the controllers of the Treasury, and in a small group of less than a dozen families that own the Federal Reserve, they control the federal regulators, they go out and take over whoever they want, they act as government.
[00:37:13.736 --> 00:37:14.776]  They have a letter of mark.
[00:37:14.956 --> 00:37:15.977]  Well, they're already doing that!
[00:37:16.958 --> 00:37:25.724]  Just like they already spied on us without warrants, and then went back and got the liability protection, the pardons.
[00:37:26.838 --> 00:37:32.423]  So there's just so many facets to this, but I just want to remind you, you're talking about $700 billion, it's really $5 trillion.
[00:37:32.763 --> 00:37:39.148]  And then in the last week it was $940 billion, and they passed over a trillion dollar defense budget Friday.
[00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:46.014]  So understand, ladies and gentlemen, they're also faking the liquidity crisis.
[00:37:46.354 --> 00:37:48.456]  The big banks are taking the money.
[00:37:48.636 --> 00:37:52.119]  It's only select banks that are being given this, the $940 something billion.
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:56.242]  And they got more than that in the last year and a half before that.
[00:37:58.792 --> 00:38:03.755]  They take that money, and then they ban shorting against themselves, as Webster talks about.
[00:38:04.315 --> 00:38:14.040]  They ban predatory action against themselves, but then attack the real economy, manufacturing, retail, the service economy.
[00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:17.262]  Then they're attacking that and taking that over right now.
[00:38:17.522 --> 00:38:19.743]  This is a vicious, militarized takeover.
[00:38:20.518 --> 00:38:38.523]  Webster Tarpley, I want to spend the three or four minutes in this segment first, because you're a top scholar, going through your bio, it's long, you've written books on the economy, papers on it, you predicted all of this, you're also an expert on Obama, and I want to get into that, but first in this abbreviated segment we have left with you,
[00:38:39.426 --> 00:38:42.387]  Then we'll come back with Barack Obama.
[00:38:42.847 --> 00:38:51.830]  I've thrown out in the last three or four minutes a few of the points I'm looking at here, but just simplifying it for people, what are they witnessing right now with this mass looting?
[00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:57.112]  Well, it is of course a world economic depression of unimaginable proportions.
[00:38:57.752 --> 00:38:59.393]  It is not controlled by anybody.
[00:38:59.573 --> 00:39:04.975]  There is no oligarchical banking group anywhere in the world that has any of this under control.
[00:39:05.075 --> 00:39:08.816]  But they are, well let me stop you, but they are engineering more stealing.
[00:39:09.176 --> 00:39:11.257]  I agree it's out of control, but they are stealing.
[00:39:14.978 --> 00:39:20.544]  Directed against others, but this is a genuine, authentic, world economic breakdown crisis.
[00:39:21.005 --> 00:39:28.332]  It is the collapse of the Anglo-American system, the post-1945 dollar-based imperialist system.
[00:39:28.472 --> 00:39:29.774]  And above all, at the center of that,
[00:39:30.194 --> 00:39:31.935]  It is the crisis of the derivatives.
[00:39:32.015 --> 00:39:34.016]  We're told that this is a bailout of mortgages.
[00:39:34.296 --> 00:39:35.336]  That is a big lie.
[00:39:35.396 --> 00:39:35.616]  Yes.
[00:39:36.216 --> 00:39:42.539]  If the government were getting mortgages, they would have then income flows or houses if there were no income flows.
[00:39:42.999 --> 00:39:44.880]  That would be much less serious.
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:45.460]  It would be bad.
[00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:49.002]  Hey, all the bad mortgages could have been paid off for less than a hundred billion.
[00:39:49.042 --> 00:39:50.082]  That is admitted.
[00:39:50.363 --> 00:39:54.005]  So why are we talking about trillions and trillions because they sold junk?
[00:39:54.545 --> 00:40:01.969]  One quadrillion, one thousand trillion to 1.5 quadrillion of derivatives, and that is what's being bailed out.
[00:40:02.029 --> 00:40:10.293]  Now, you're very right to point out that this is monstrous, it's elitist, it's oligarchical, it's unconstitutional, it's criminal, and all this other stuff.
[00:40:10.574 --> 00:40:12.054]  Let me just focus on the other point.
[00:40:12.354 --> 00:40:13.275]  It's futile.
[00:40:13.655 --> 00:40:14.956]  You cannot prop up
[00:40:15.396 --> 00:40:15.576]  I think?
[00:40:33.787 --> 00:40:35.207]  Yes, and they know that.
[00:40:35.267 --> 00:40:37.328]  They know it ends in the end of the dollar.
[00:40:37.828 --> 00:40:44.090]  My point is, Webster, $940 billion was shelled out last week, and the public doesn't even know.
[00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:46.211]  It's buried in Reuters and AP.
[00:40:46.571 --> 00:40:55.173]  Meanwhile, the public's talking about revolting over $700 billion, and as you said, they're blaming the public for this on subprime mortgages, and it has nothing to do with it!
[00:40:55.513 --> 00:40:55.693]  Right.
[00:40:55.753 --> 00:40:56.713]  The reactionary myth
[00:40:58.934 --> 00:40:59.154]  I think?
[00:41:15.314 --> 00:41:20.879]  We've got Bradford and Bingley, which is the second largest mortgage bank in the United Kingdom.
[00:41:20.959 --> 00:41:24.763]  We had WAMU, the biggest bank in world history to go under, went under three days ago.
[00:41:24.783 --> 00:41:29.206]  We had Washington Mutual, we also have HBOS Bank, another very large British mortgage bank.
[00:41:29.226 --> 00:41:31.208]  And two weeks ago we had Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
[00:41:31.689 --> 00:41:34.051]  Okay, so it's an authentic world economic depression.
[00:41:34.091 --> 00:41:36.313]  Now your basic choices are three, and let me stress this.
[00:41:36.873 --> 00:41:47.723]  The first is the hyperinflationary bailout that you're seeing right now, which is what Goldman Sachs is demanding, through Paulson, with the help of Pelosi and Reid, and Obama.
[00:41:47.763 --> 00:41:52.968]  The Democratic Party is by and large the principal party of Wall Street and the bailout.
[00:41:52.988 --> 00:41:55.871]  And the real economy gets nothing, but we set the bill for all of it.
[00:41:55.891 --> 00:41:58.153]  Let me just try to enumerate the three possibilities.
[00:41:58.553 --> 00:42:00.834]  The first one is the hyperinflationary bailout.
[00:42:00.874 --> 00:42:02.395]  That's what you have to stop now.
[00:42:02.515 --> 00:42:06.597]  Any person of goodwill has to say no, no, no, a thousand times no.
[00:42:07.377 --> 00:42:13.500]  However, if that's all you do, you get the second possibility, which is the deflationary crash.
[00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:23.684]  And people who just say, no to the bailout, go back to the free market, unfortunately, that will get you into chain reaction bankruptcies of the large money center banks.
[00:42:23.744 --> 00:42:25.585]  It will lead to a general banking panic.
[00:42:26.085 --> 00:42:28.306]  And a deflationary crash on the model of 1930, 31, 32.
[00:42:28.867 --> 00:42:36.411]  With a stagflation overlay, you're still going to have the Weimar Republic type printing press stuff.
[00:42:36.431 --> 00:42:39.914]  Well, the printing press is the hyperinflationary one, so that would be number one.
[00:42:39.954 --> 00:42:41.274]  But you can have the two together.
[00:42:42.375 --> 00:42:43.155]  You might have that too.
[00:42:43.176 --> 00:42:45.737]  You might have a hyperinflationary depression.
[00:42:45.757 --> 00:42:46.998]  That's certainly a possibility.
[00:42:47.438 --> 00:42:53.941]  But I think just to simplify it, either the hyperinflationary bailout, which ends in failure of course, or the deflationary one.
[00:42:53.982 --> 00:42:55.782]  The third one is the obvious thing to do.
[00:42:56.203 --> 00:42:57.443]  Return to the New Deal.
[00:42:57.723 --> 00:43:05.187]  Return to the tested, tried and true, absolutely proven, and fact-tested remedies of the New Deal.
[00:43:05.247 --> 00:43:06.008]  Now Webster, stay there.
[00:43:06.028 --> 00:43:08.749]  We're going to come back and let you get into that and then Barack Obama.
[00:43:09.009 --> 00:43:09.650]  But to be clear...
[00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:14.153]  Again, this is socialism for the bankers or socialism for the people.
[00:43:14.754 --> 00:43:18.336]  And the reason it's the lesser of two evils is it would build the real economy.
[00:43:18.637 --> 00:43:23.881]  Which instead, the bankers are collapsing what's left of the real economy to finance and fund themselves.
[00:43:24.381 --> 00:43:26.263]  Alright, we got the Barack Obama stuff coming up.
[00:43:26.323 --> 00:43:27.604]  Talk bad about Barack Obama.
[00:43:27.844 --> 00:43:28.465]  Go to jail.
[00:43:28.485 --> 00:43:29.105]  We're not kidding.
[00:43:29.606 --> 00:43:31.087]  Honey, have you seen the remote?
[00:43:31.427 --> 00:43:33.208]  Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?
[00:43:33.629 --> 00:43:35.010]  I can't find my wallet.
[00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:36.091]  Sound familiar?
[00:43:36.231 --> 00:43:39.533]  Why not save time looking for lost things and lose the stress instead?

[00:44:39.319 --> 00:44:43.761]  You may not like what I'm about to say, but you know I'm gonna say it anyway.
[00:44:43.781 --> 00:44:51.864]  The government doesn't want the best for you, they keep you down, they keep you blue, they starve your body for all its nutrients.
[00:44:53.912 --> 00:44:55.993]  They won't let you grow industrial hemp.
[00:44:56.353 --> 00:45:01.735]  It really doesn't make any kind of sense when it's so healthy for the world and useful for you, my friends.
[00:45:03.656 --> 00:45:08.198]  I hope Mr. Bush will hear this song, for the heart of America wants this one.
[00:45:08.238 --> 00:45:11.339]  Go to hempusa.org.
[00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:17.962]  If you're a truther, an anarchist, a renegade, you only want things that God has made.
[00:45:18.022 --> 00:45:20.483]  Go to hempusa.org.
[00:45:22.503 --> 00:45:24.625]  We offer free shipping anywhere in the states.
[00:45:24.725 --> 00:45:28.407]  Go to hempusa.org.
[00:45:29.868 --> 00:45:45.079]  You know, as a father and a husband, one of the enjoyable things in my life has been walking in at night and checking on my children, checking up on my wife, making sure she has the things she needs, but mostly providing for my family and knowing that they're secure, that they feel comfortable every day in their little skins.
[00:45:45.099 --> 00:45:49.462]  They don't have to worry about the oddities of the world taking over and wrecking their lives.
[00:45:49.482 --> 00:45:51.484]  I've always wanted to be a good provider.
[00:45:51.664 --> 00:46:03.068]  And I'm not going to change that now just because the economy's in upheaval, and because there's a lot of political and social uncertainty, and I hear about global famines, and I see the escalating prices in gas and food and oil.
[00:46:03.228 --> 00:46:05.128]  Electricity's going to go way up, I'm told, this winter.
[00:46:05.248 --> 00:46:06.289]  Hey, I'm not going to sweat it.
[00:46:06.409 --> 00:46:07.369]  I've done the right thing.
[00:46:07.429 --> 00:46:09.690]  I got rid of a bunch of junk and toys out in the garage.
[00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:11.450]  I converted that money into food.
[00:46:11.610 --> 00:46:12.311]  That food's out there.
[00:46:12.331 --> 00:46:14.211]  I've got a two or three year supply of food in the garage.
[00:46:14.291 --> 00:46:15.332]  My family's secure.
[00:46:15.352 --> 00:46:16.632]  I don't got to worry, okay?
[00:46:16.852 --> 00:46:19.475]  I do hope that you'll join me in this new sense of American security.
[00:46:19.575 --> 00:46:21.036]  Call eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:46:21.116 --> 00:46:22.578]  That's eFoodsDirect.com.

[00:46:28.584 --> 00:46:29.384]  You'll be glad you did.
[00:46:29.605 --> 00:46:31.326]  Lead from solder and copper pipes.
[00:46:31.486 --> 00:46:32.547]  Mercury from fish.
[00:46:32.647 --> 00:46:33.408]  Dental fillings.
[00:46:33.568 --> 00:46:34.129]  Vaccines.
[00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:35.189]  Arsenic in the water.
[00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:39.171]  These heavy metal toxins are difficult or even impossible to avoid.
[00:46:39.332 --> 00:46:43.093]  Even trace amounts of these heavy metals over time can impact your health.
[00:46:43.293 --> 00:46:54.679]  Many health problems have been suggested as being related to this heavy metal exposure, including memory loss, high blood pressure, depression, mood swings, speech disorders, neuropathy, autoimmune diseases, chronic fatigue, and more.
[00:46:54.839 --> 00:47:00.842]  Unfortunately, traditional detoxifying isn't able to clear the body of these harmful and potentially deadly toxins.
[00:47:01.022 --> 00:47:03.464]  That's why there's Puraclear from Ripple Creek.
[00:47:03.584 --> 00:47:13.090]  Puraclear contains a proprietary blend of ingredients including a cilantro extract and alpha lipoic acid, among other ingredients formulated specifically to promote body cleansing.
[00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:21.855]  Puraclear also has ingredients selected to promote improved circulation to enhance activity so that heavy metals may be more effectively captured and removed from the body.

[00:47:33.095 --> 00:47:37.238]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:47:51.366 --> 00:47:52.887]  Okay, folks, we're back live.
[00:47:53.228 --> 00:47:54.909]  Look, I want to be clear here.
[00:47:54.969 --> 00:47:56.770]  Webster and myself are not disagreeing.
[00:47:57.826 --> 00:48:13.317]  On this subject of the Anglo-American banking system, the statement I'm making is they made the decision to securitize all these different derivatives to make up all these new flim-flam articles in the last 20 years.
[00:48:13.337 --> 00:48:16.098]  There was always a lot of fraud involved in central banking.
[00:48:16.138 --> 00:48:22.643]  That's the real banking where the private families control the government's issue in sub-currency and credit and then they can leverage out, you know,
[00:48:24.269 --> 00:48:29.891]  9 to 20 times, depending on the government, what they actually have in deposits.
[00:48:31.212 --> 00:48:44.177]  But when you hear that it was countrywide and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and all of this, you know, going out to people that were poor and giving them, you know, 2, 3, 4 percent mortgages that then ballooned later, and that you hear, that's what caused all this.
[00:48:44.197 --> 00:48:45.838]  That has nothing to do with it.
[00:48:47.378 --> 00:48:49.039]  That's less than a hundred billion dollars.
[00:48:49.059 --> 00:48:51.620]  We're talking about thousands of trillions here.
[00:48:52.529 --> 00:48:53.730]  That's admitted numbers.
[00:48:55.291 --> 00:48:59.935]  We're talking close to a trillion, 940 billion bailed out last week.
[00:49:00.695 --> 00:49:11.183]  Now the point is they already moved into real assets, they wrote white papers how this was going to collapse, how they knew it was going to collapse, and how out of this they're going to set up a new international banking system.
[00:49:11.835 --> 00:49:23.046]  And by the way, Kissinger came out last week, a bunch of others came out, exactly as we told you years ago they would and said, now we need a world government run by the private bankers and you buy carbon tax credits from them.
[00:49:24.327 --> 00:49:26.890]  And so yes, is it imploding?
[00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:27.791]  Is it a real crisis?
[00:49:27.811 --> 00:49:29.913]  Yes, but did they foresee that?
[00:49:30.293 --> 00:49:31.014]  Did they at least
[00:49:31.696 --> 00:49:33.777]  Delude themselves into believing they would control it.
[00:49:34.018 --> 00:49:35.939]  There is no debating that.
[00:49:35.959 --> 00:49:50.028]  And I don't think Webster disagrees with me on that point, that they opportunistically, you know, as expert opportunist adepts at it, have, again, they create crises, offer the solution, but the crisis itself is very real.
[00:49:50.308 --> 00:49:51.069]  Webster, continue.
[00:50:01.956 --> 00:50:04.597]  The Democratic Party, unfortunately, would be the vehicle.
[00:50:04.657 --> 00:50:14.061]  Now, the New Deal, of course, without somebody like Jesse Jones, since we're on the radio here in Texas, without Jesse Jones, the state of Texas wouldn't exist.
[00:50:14.401 --> 00:50:22.444]  The Reconstruction Finance Corporation, in the 1930s and in the 1940s, essentially built the industrial infrastructure of the whole state.
[00:50:22.484 --> 00:50:25.806]  So that's the New Deal, and that then became private companies.
[00:50:26.661 --> 00:50:33.423]  The way to approach this crisis is to say, well, you've got one and a half quadrillion of derivatives, right?
[00:50:33.463 --> 00:50:34.483]  That's the avalanche.
[00:50:34.523 --> 00:50:37.864]  The mortgage back... For those who don't know, that's just made-up crud.
[00:50:38.384 --> 00:50:40.165]  Yeah, it's complete paper.
[00:50:40.285 --> 00:50:46.587]  Now, the subprime mortgage is sort of the firecracker that set off this enormous avalanche.
[00:50:46.627 --> 00:50:51.068]  So what you've got to do is realize that the essence of these derivatives is leverage.
[00:50:51.408 --> 00:50:55.369]  And as long as that was positive leverage, there were huge super profits at the top.
[00:50:55.809 --> 00:51:03.794]  The entire edifice of one and a half quadrillion of derivatives has now gone into reverse leverage, and that is now a black hole.
[00:51:03.814 --> 00:51:04.935]  There's no stopping that.
[00:51:04.955 --> 00:51:05.516]  It's just impossible.
[00:51:25.969 --> 00:51:27.630]  Target, first of all, the derivatives.
[00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:31.371]  The derivatives were illegal up until about 1992-1993.
[00:51:31.691 --> 00:51:34.612]  They were widely considered illegal.
[00:51:34.952 --> 00:51:41.814]  We had a law that was based on an attempt to corner the wheat market in 1933 based on options and futures.
[00:51:42.255 --> 00:51:47.016]  It was illegal to sell an option on a farm product anywhere in the United States.
[00:51:47.036 --> 00:51:49.197]  Or you put a tax on it so they can't make it short.
[00:51:49.737 --> 00:51:51.378]  You could use a tax.
[00:51:51.418 --> 00:51:59.101]  You could use a Tobin tax or a security transfer tax on the derivatives and say, we demand 1% of derivatives for the public treasury.
[00:51:59.401 --> 00:52:01.661]  Let's slap a sales tax on these oligarchs.
[00:52:02.042 --> 00:52:03.102]  We're paying sales tax.
[00:52:03.162 --> 00:52:05.323]  Let them pay sales tax, too.
[00:52:05.343 --> 00:52:14.026]  The problem is, in this kind of an emergency, and it really is an emergency, I think the best thing to do is Executive Order, Defense Production Act, Trading with the Enemy Act,
[00:52:14.226 --> 00:52:15.487]  Instead, the private inner circle of banks
[00:52:31.716 --> 00:52:50.352]  ...are using federal regulators to even go after some solvent banks that's now coming out, to loot them using regulatory power they control, and they, as you said last week on the show, have turned loose the trillions that is being pumped into them out of the Treasury, and they're doing derivatives and leveraging and shorting and attacking the real economy.
[00:52:50.832 --> 00:52:59.014]  Yeah, the entire system is now being run as if the goal of the United States government would be to maintain the derivatives bubble.
[00:52:59.054 --> 00:53:06.616]  Now this has got everything... And so they're feeding the real economy backwards into it, into the black hole, to keep it going.
[00:53:06.856 --> 00:53:08.036]  Yeah, and it can't work.
[00:53:08.056 --> 00:53:09.477]  So what we've got to say is no.
[00:53:10.257 --> 00:53:11.939]  Derivatives have to be wiped out.
[00:53:12.059 --> 00:53:13.901]  They've got to be wiped out by executive order.
[00:53:14.002 --> 00:53:14.823]  One stroke of the pen.
[00:53:15.143 --> 00:53:16.605]  Derivatives are hereby illegal.
[00:53:16.845 --> 00:53:17.586]  We wipe them out.
[00:53:17.906 --> 00:53:23.453]  And the way that you enforce that, of course, is you take the top ten banks on Wall Street, starting with JPMorgan Chase.
[00:53:23.753 --> 00:53:24.774]  They're about half of it.
[00:53:25.155 --> 00:53:28.679]  If you add in Citibank and Bank of America, you're up to two-thirds.
[00:53:29.179 --> 00:53:35.007]  If you read a few more, the 8 or 10 top banks represent 90 to 95% of the derivatives.
[00:53:35.127 --> 00:53:37.510]  But I want to explain something to people, Webster.
[00:53:37.690 --> 00:53:40.033]  The average person doesn't understand you, Webster.
[00:53:40.073 --> 00:53:41.314]  They don't understand, Webster.
[00:53:41.695 --> 00:53:42.936]  I don't understand, Webster.
[00:53:42.956 --> 00:53:43.938]  We're moving too fast.
[00:53:44.558 --> 00:53:48.422]  They don't even know that $940 billion was pumped in last week.
[00:53:48.463 --> 00:53:49.404]  You mean, what is that?
[00:53:49.424 --> 00:53:50.405]  Federal Reserve lending?
[00:53:50.605 --> 00:53:50.865]  Yes.
[00:53:51.185 --> 00:53:52.387]  Alright, so that's lending.
[00:53:52.447 --> 00:53:53.948]  I mean, they call that lending.
[00:53:53.988 --> 00:53:56.711]  This other thing is even worse because it's basically a giveaway.
[00:53:56.731 --> 00:53:57.773]  And that's my next point.
[00:53:57.853 --> 00:54:02.718]  I want you to comment on the fact that it gives the Treasury this new above-government power.
[00:54:03.863 --> 00:54:07.387]  Yeah, obviously what Paulson wanted was to become a juridical vacuum.
[00:54:07.447 --> 00:54:18.140]  I mean, he wanted to become a unique figure in the whole history of the United States, that nothing Paulson did would be reviewable by the courts, by the Congress, by any regulatory agency.
[00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:19.081]  I mean, he basically said,
[00:54:19.401 --> 00:54:22.142]  Make me economic dictator of the United States for life.
[00:54:22.443 --> 00:54:27.025]  He could have carried out criminal acts and nobody could have said a word to him because he has this piece of paper.
[00:54:27.085 --> 00:54:37.570]  Now I think that that has probably been cut out of the bill, but of course we don't know because the bill they announced in the dead of night, right after midnight, they announced that there was a deal
[00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:42.552]  Uh, the deal has still not been put on paper, as far as I know, so far this afternoon.
[00:54:42.592 --> 00:54:43.693]  There's pieces of it out.
[00:54:43.753 --> 00:54:45.734]  It's just that they're not taking it out.
[00:54:45.854 --> 00:54:52.817]  It's a monstrosity, and the only thing to do with that is vote it down, load it up with killer amendments, filibuster it, block it.
[00:54:53.178 --> 00:54:56.759]  There were about a dozen people in the House who came forward.
[00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:59.461]  I saw Kucinich, Kaptur, Itza.
[00:55:00.782 --> 00:55:07.026]  A number of others came forward and said that they were against it, but it was a pretty small group.
[00:55:07.326 --> 00:55:09.427]  But again, what we need to do, we have to be clear.
[00:55:09.487 --> 00:55:10.348]  How do you get out of this?
[00:55:10.568 --> 00:55:11.829]  You wipe out derivatives.
[00:55:11.869 --> 00:55:13.350]  Now, let's take foreclosures.
[00:55:13.370 --> 00:55:14.371]  This is a serious problem.
[00:55:14.631 --> 00:55:16.072]  There are lots and lots of foreclosures.
[00:55:19.933 --> 00:55:24.937]  Imagine the monstrosity of close to a trillion dollars in lending last week to the bankers.
[00:55:25.497 --> 00:55:27.658]  Now they're talking about a five trillion dollar bailout.
[00:55:27.698 --> 00:55:28.599]  That's Bloomberg.
[00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:31.921]  Joseph Stiglitz is saying it's over five trillion.
[00:55:31.961 --> 00:55:33.903]  He calls it a monstrosity.
[00:55:33.943 --> 00:55:34.883]  That's actually a quote.
[00:55:35.043 --> 00:55:36.084]  He calls it monstrous.
[00:55:37.045 --> 00:55:42.088]  And he saw the documents inside what they were planning to do, former head of the World Bank, former chief economist there.
[00:55:43.129 --> 00:55:44.550]  And notice the government
[00:55:45.130 --> 00:55:51.237]  Only 9% in the latest polls are for this, but notice we have both parties together saying we don't care.
[00:55:51.517 --> 00:55:54.100]  The public and the real economy gets nothing.
[00:55:54.341 --> 00:55:56.183]  And I'm against the socialism, but we're going to have it.
[00:55:56.363 --> 00:55:57.704]  For heaven's sakes, have it for the people.
[00:55:58.085 --> 00:55:59.266]  No, we get nothing.
[00:55:59.426 --> 00:56:01.949]  Everything is now transferred to the bankers.
[00:56:02.009 --> 00:56:02.630]  Comment on that.
[00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:07.887]  Well, there's a proposal to put $25 billion into the Detroit automobile industry.
[00:56:08.208 --> 00:56:15.019]  I would support that, even though the goals of the $25 billion for Detroit are wrong.
[00:56:15.079 --> 00:56:15.940]  That's only a loan!
[00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:17.002]  They should just give it to him!
[00:56:17.685 --> 00:56:19.046]  Well, they can lend it to them.
[00:56:19.086 --> 00:56:21.248]  They can do it in any number of ways.
[00:56:21.548 --> 00:56:26.832]  It might be a good idea to nationalize Chrysler and prevent Cerberus Hedge Fund from destroying it.
[00:56:27.973 --> 00:56:31.536]  I think, generally speaking, you've got to channel money into actual production.
[00:56:31.656 --> 00:56:33.898]  Anything that goes for paper is wasted.
[00:56:34.138 --> 00:56:35.099]  Forget about paper.
[00:56:35.419 --> 00:56:37.060]  Forget about the prices of paper.
[00:56:37.441 --> 00:56:39.582]  Think about people and production.
[00:56:39.622 --> 00:56:41.304]  And that, again, gets us to foreclosures.
[00:56:41.844 --> 00:56:47.008]  If you have people getting thrown out of their homes, family farms shutting down, businesses shut down.
[00:56:47.288 --> 00:56:49.330]  Let's suppose you're a truck driver, right?
[00:56:49.370 --> 00:56:52.593]  You own your own rig, and you're out there holding goods on the interstate.
[00:56:52.913 --> 00:56:54.574]  Somebody tries to foreclose on you.
[00:56:54.934 --> 00:56:56.556]  We need federal protection.
[00:56:56.896 --> 00:57:02.260]  And this, of course, is the opposite of where they're going right now, but we've got to mobilize to impose this.
[00:57:02.620 --> 00:57:10.026]  That nobody's thrown out of their home, no family farm is shut down, no rig, no taxi company, no trucking company, no airline.
[00:57:10.146 --> 00:57:13.149]  And by the way, people are going to say, well that's pure socialism.
[00:57:13.189 --> 00:57:16.713]  My point is, you don't just throw trillions... You can call it what you want.
[00:57:16.913 --> 00:57:20.597]  Do you want to maintain human civilization in this crisis?
[00:57:20.617 --> 00:57:32.129]  Well Webster, that's the point I was going to make, is that instead it's just throw trillions into the banker's black hole who engineered all of this, or do we at least say, you know, a moratorium on
[00:57:33.290 --> 00:57:36.313]  I think you basically formulated the alternatives in a pretty good way.
[00:57:36.494 --> 00:57:39.257]  The other thing we have to do is this question of the Federal Reserve.
[00:57:55.976 --> 00:58:00.920]  Now, the Federal Reserve, as everybody knows, is illegal, unconstitutional, criminal, never been audited.
[00:58:01.021 --> 00:58:03.243]  It's a monstrosity in its own right.
[00:58:04.243 --> 00:58:05.004]  What do we do now?
[00:58:05.264 --> 00:58:06.205]  Nationalize it.
[00:58:06.465 --> 00:58:06.906]  Seize it.
[00:58:07.606 --> 00:58:08.007]  Audit it.
[00:58:08.207 --> 00:58:08.848]  Nationalize it.
[00:58:08.868 --> 00:58:10.469]  You can probably send Greenspan to jail.
[00:58:10.489 --> 00:58:10.849]  Stay there.
[00:58:10.889 --> 00:58:11.610]  Gotta break, Webster.
[00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:14.873]  We're gonna come back in for news, finish up with this, and I promise, get into Barack Obama.
[00:58:15.153 --> 00:58:16.374]  You are not gonna believe this.
[00:58:16.434 --> 00:58:18.716]  Criticize Barack Obama, you're gonna be arrested.
[00:58:18.736 --> 00:58:19.177]  Stay with us.
[00:58:19.978 --> 00:58:24.199]  It's no secret that Genesis Communications Network depends on listeners like you.

[00:58:50.726 --> 00:58:53.207]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[00:58:53.667 --> 00:58:55.588]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:58:56.288 --> 00:58:59.449]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:59:00.110 --> 00:59:06.572]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.

[00:59:10.473 --> 00:59:11.874]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:59:19.884 --> 00:59:20.524]  It's a fact.
[00:59:20.744 --> 00:59:28.228]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:59:28.348 --> 00:59:37.212]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[00:59:37.472 --> 00:59:48.017]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:59:48.277 --> 00:59:54.342]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[00:59:54.562 --> 00:59:59.586]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[00:59:59.766 --> 01:00:04.249]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[01:00:04.409 --> 01:00:06.231]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[01:00:06.271 --> 01:00:06.551]  That's 877-943-8600.

[01:00:19.163 --> 01:00:22.549]  Enough federal assistance to those affected by Ike.
[01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:24.433]  You have the power.
[01:00:24.453 --> 01:00:26.537]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:27.759 --> 01:00:28.400]  Check your watch.
[01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:29.362]  It is 5 o'clock.
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:35.561]  Hi, RNUSA Radio News.
[01:00:35.861 --> 01:00:36.702]  I'm Jody Jordan.
[01:00:37.022 --> 01:00:41.544]  A tentative deal has been reached to help the imperiled financial markets on Wall Street.
[01:00:42.104 --> 01:00:43.745]  A House vote could come tomorrow.
[01:00:44.206 --> 01:00:52.750]  The plan calls for the government to receive stock warrants in return for the bailout relief, which gives taxpayers a chance to share in financial companies' future profits.
[01:00:53.411 --> 01:00:59.354]  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid hints that talks involving Treasury Chief Henry Paulson were a bit testy.
[01:00:59.494 --> 01:01:01.355]  Mr. Secretary, we have
[01:01:02.481 --> 01:01:08.765]  Had a lot of pleasant words and some that haven't always been pleasant, but I really appreciate your hard work.
[01:01:09.025 --> 01:01:16.810]  Despite forcing some changes to the bailout plan, it's unclear how many Republicans in the House are satisfied enough to support it tomorrow.
[01:01:17.290 --> 01:01:25.995]  The House GOP fought for and won a compromise they claim will save taxpayers at least some money, despite the Treasury Department's objection.
[01:01:26.695 --> 01:01:29.097]  This is IRN USA Radio News.
[01:01:30.586 --> 01:01:33.089]  The following from News Broadcast Network.
[01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:41.140]  If you're one of the thousands of people whose mortgage debt was foreclosed or partially forgiven in 2007, you may be entitled to a tax break.
[01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:45.406]  The chair of the American Bar Association Tax Section, Bill Wilkins, explains.
[01:01:45.706 --> 01:01:49.849]  You should have filed an IRS Form 982 with last year's return to get tax relief.
[01:01:49.989 --> 01:01:58.734]  If you've already filed and didn't include that form, send the IRS an amended 2007 income tax return along with a completed Form 982 before October 15th.
[01:01:58.774 --> 01:02:04.318]  For more information about the tax relief, go to www.taxtips4u.org.
[01:02:04.578 --> 01:02:05.479]  I'm John Dridden.
[01:02:06.155 --> 01:02:15.582]  Registered dietitian Mitzi Dilan, nutritionist for the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals, says the workout isn't over until athletes replenish the vitamins and nutrients lost during play.
[01:02:16.002 --> 01:02:25.088]  I recommend reaching for chocolate milk after practice or a big game because it has high-quality protein that helps build lean muscle when combined with exercise.

[01:02:28.570 --> 01:02:29.331]  I'm Lee Shepherd.
[01:02:31.155 --> 01:02:34.178]  Barack Obama and Joe Biden will be back in Michigan today.
[01:02:34.198 --> 01:02:38.301]  A recent poll suggests Obama has a commanding lead in the state.
[01:02:38.941 --> 01:02:43.285]  Obama is saying some of his campaign ads haven't always been accurate.
[01:02:43.485 --> 01:02:52.092]  And there have been two or three times where we slipped beneath my standard, you know, where it was kind of a stretch.
[01:02:52.854 --> 01:02:55.516]  And so when that happens, I tell my team, pull it down.
[01:02:55.656 --> 01:03:00.099]  John McCain is joining ABC News for a town hall meeting in Columbus, Ohio.
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:02.341]  Sarah Palin has nothing scheduled.
[01:03:03.161 --> 01:03:07.985]  And Hurricane Kyle is streaming north on a course that'll take it to the coast of Maine as soon as tonight.
[01:03:08.685 --> 01:03:11.307]  Stacey Stewart is with the National Hurricane Center.
[01:03:11.407 --> 01:03:19.493]  The New England states will be getting some of the rain associated with Kyle, but they likely won't receive any of the really significant winds, most of the wind.
[01:03:20.177 --> 01:03:24.962]  Strong winds will remain on the east side of Kyle and that will primarily affect the Canadian provinces.

[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.361]  Why do I take non-drowsy Claritin?
[01:03:32.541 --> 01:03:34.242]  I love watching my son play soccer.
[01:03:34.322 --> 01:03:37.804]  But when allergies hit, I sneeze and my eyes get itchy and watery.
[01:03:37.904 --> 01:03:40.626]  Claritin relieves all my worst symptoms without drowsiness.
[01:03:40.786 --> 01:03:43.027]  So when he scores a goal, I know I won't miss it.
[01:03:43.167 --> 01:03:47.870]  And only non-drowsy Claritin is clinically proven to make me as alert and focused as someone without allergies.
[01:03:48.110 --> 01:03:50.311]  Get Claritin Clear with non-drowsy Claritin.
[01:03:50.391 --> 01:03:53.653]  Powerful relief from all your worst allergy symptoms without drowsiness.
[01:03:53.853 --> 01:03:54.393]  Stay alert.
[01:03:54.513 --> 01:03:55.354]  Stay focused.
[01:03:55.414 --> 01:03:56.514]  Live Claritin Clear.
[01:03:56.714 --> 01:03:57.555]  Indoors and out.
[01:03:57.655 --> 01:03:58.215]  Use as directed.
[01:03:58.295 --> 01:03:59.416]  Only brand clinically tested.
[01:04:02.899 --> 01:04:04.020]  Thank you!
[01:04:06.542 --> 01:04:15.929]  People in Mission Control clap as China's Shenzhou 7 spacecraft arrives back on Earth following its successful attempt at the country's first ever spacewalk.
[01:04:16.590 --> 01:04:20.773]  The Chinese space program's next major goal is to assemble a space station.
[01:04:21.693 --> 01:04:22.313]  The U.S.
[01:04:22.393 --> 01:04:26.054]  has supplied Israel with a radar to pick up Iranian missiles.
[01:04:26.575 --> 01:04:27.395]  Here's Mark Levy.
[01:04:27.675 --> 01:04:29.456]  It's a concrete sign that the U.S.
[01:04:29.496 --> 01:04:32.076]  takes the Iranian threat against Israel seriously.
[01:04:32.477 --> 01:04:36.498]  The sophisticated radar arrived in Israel in American military transport planes.
[01:04:36.918 --> 01:04:38.620]  Israel Radio says the U.S.
[01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:40.622]  also sent specialists to operate it.
[01:04:40.963 --> 01:04:44.526]  The radar expands Israel's warning time of an Iranian missile strike.
[01:04:44.867 --> 01:04:48.791]  It can pick up a missile more than a thousand miles away with the help of satellites.
[01:04:49.171 --> 01:04:54.277]  That would give more time to aim arrow anti-missiles at it and for Israelis at home to take cover.
[01:04:54.921 --> 01:04:56.022]  Mark Levy, Tel Aviv.
[01:04:56.202 --> 01:05:03.585]  And authorities say a medevac helicopter taking accident victims to a trauma center crashed in suburban Washington, D.C.
[01:05:03.685 --> 01:05:07.046]  early today, killing four of the five people aboard.
[01:05:07.646 --> 01:05:09.527]  Weather may have been a factor in the crash.
[01:05:09.927 --> 01:05:11.188]  Here's David Iannone.
[01:05:11.368 --> 01:05:25.798]  Shortly before the crash, Prince George's County fire officials had been requested to send two ambulances to the hangar where the medevac is housed at Andrews Air Force Base to complete the transport because the helicopter is not going to be able to complete the transport due to heavy rain and fog.
[01:05:25.998 --> 01:05:29.321]  I'm Jody Jordan and that's news from the Information Radio Network.
[01:05:30.453 --> 01:05:33.914]  Attention, this is an extremely urgent self-reliant news bulletin.

[01:05:56.023 --> 01:05:58.104]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[01:05:58.144 --> 01:05:58.625]  this fall?

[01:06:58.541 --> 01:07:02.783]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[01:07:03.803 --> 01:07:14.188]  You know, a lot of times, I didn't try to cover too much.
[01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:18.382]  I mean, just every facet of what's happening.
[01:07:18.422 --> 01:07:32.915]  The fact that private banks took the country over, took the real economy that leveraged it thousands of times, bought up the world's infrastructure, and are now leaving us holding the bag, and there's no way to even pay it all off or fix it.
[01:07:33.976 --> 01:07:38.020]  All we can do is arrest them, basically, prosecute them for the crimes they've committed.
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:40.342]  Ron Paul says, Bernanke and, uh,
[01:07:41.974 --> 01:07:44.436]  Greenspan should be arrested, Paulson should be arrested.
[01:07:44.936 --> 01:07:48.779]  The audio from the radio interview Thursday is up on InfoWars.com.
[01:07:49.599 --> 01:07:54.342]  A lot of other economists, Ron Paul is an economist as well as a medical doctor, are saying arrest them.
[01:07:54.382 --> 01:07:57.324]  This is criminal what has been done.
[01:07:57.344 --> 01:08:00.186]  I mean it is just amazing what's been done.
[01:08:00.727 --> 01:08:10.073]  And so all we can do is say this debt is an ode, basically arrest these people, nationalize it, as Webster Tarpley was saying, and then try to have a crash landing.
[01:08:10.718 --> 01:08:17.883]  Instead, we're at 747 going straight down, and they've got the engines floored, and they're giggling and smirking as it happens.
[01:08:17.903 --> 01:08:19.444]  Now, I want to get into Barack Obama.
[01:08:19.924 --> 01:08:22.226]  This is one of the strangest things I've ever seen.
[01:08:23.687 --> 01:08:27.489]  And I want to introduce that before Webster and I get into it.
[01:08:27.750 --> 01:08:32.453]  So finish up briefly, Webster, because I'm going to spend the rest of the hour on this, on Obama.
[01:08:34.028 --> 01:08:38.150]  Finish up with the economic outlook, because we know they're not going to do the right thing.
[01:08:38.410 --> 01:08:43.852]  We know the people can try to put pressure on them, but literally, they're going to use the police state to do the criminal thing.
[01:08:44.432 --> 01:08:47.233]  That's what the police state is there for, is to guard them in their crimes.
[01:08:47.893 --> 01:08:52.795]  So, I guess my last question on the economics is, you left off of nationalizing the Federal Reserve.
[01:08:53.215 --> 01:08:54.436]  People are like, well it is national.
[01:08:54.636 --> 01:08:58.157]  No, it's private folks like Federal Express or Federal Plumbing.
[01:08:59.938 --> 01:09:03.380]  But instead, let's talk about what they're really going to do.
[01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:08.523]  We know what they should do, and I agree with you, but instead, they're not going to do that.
[01:09:09.484 --> 01:09:12.586]  Well, I think it's important for a mass movement to emerge around this.
[01:09:12.646 --> 01:09:18.629]  In other words, we could have a party realignment if some prominent politician would come forward and say no to the bailout.
[01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:24.113]  For a couple of days, it looked like McCain might even do that, but he's gone in the other direction.
[01:09:24.473 --> 01:09:27.595]  McCain has probably thrown away the presidency and just about guaranteed
[01:09:28.155 --> 01:09:30.256]  Okay, but I mean, I want your analysis.
[01:09:30.276 --> 01:09:31.697]  I mean, I really, you know...
[01:09:49.753 --> 01:09:52.456]  I want to know your take on where this is going.
[01:09:52.696 --> 01:09:55.480]  Well, the main thing is that we have to seize the initiative.
[01:09:55.520 --> 01:10:01.787]  The mass movement, the popular mobilization, has got to seize the initiative around things like wipe out the rivets.
[01:10:01.807 --> 01:10:04.810]  But it's football season, man, so what if the future's gone?
[01:10:05.331 --> 01:10:06.853]  There's some thumbsucking to do.
[01:10:07.133 --> 01:10:10.437]  Stop all foreclosures and nationalize the Federal Reserve.
[01:10:11.117 --> 01:10:27.545]  You have a situation now where the Federal Reserve lends money to JPMorgan Chase at 2%, JPMorgan Chase turns and lends that back to the Treasury at 4.5 or 5%, so they're getting 3%, and it's often been more, for doing absolutely nothing.
[01:10:27.865 --> 01:10:33.128]  We need to basically end that kind of a situation by asserting government control over
[01:10:33.228 --> 01:10:36.050]  And then we can remonetize it and actually have the money be worth more.
[01:10:36.130 --> 01:10:36.671]  I agree.
[01:10:37.091 --> 01:10:38.872]  In fact, I was just looking at C-SPAN right now.
[01:10:38.892 --> 01:10:47.839]  They've got a McClatchy newspaper guy up there, Kevin Hall, and on screen they show the New York Times with a front page, I believe, of the business section saying, Wall Street, rest in peace.
[01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:51.142]  So, I mean, they're now admitting there's no way to turn this around.
[01:10:51.782 --> 01:11:04.800]  Well, what's going to happen now, I would say, is with the 700 billion and these other subsidiary bailouts that you've got, and the British government is buying the derivatives book of this place, Bradford and Bingley, for about 80 billion dollars, 41 billion pounds.
[01:11:07.344 --> 01:11:12.330]  With this, they might be able to get into December, maybe even into January.
[01:11:12.391 --> 01:11:12.811]  I don't know.
[01:11:12.851 --> 01:11:16.656]  There'll be a certain pause for the presidential election.
[01:11:17.057 --> 01:11:18.539]  There'll be a pause for Christmas.
[01:11:18.579 --> 01:11:22.044]  But I would say right after that, right in the beginning of January, at the latest.
[01:11:22.524 --> 01:11:24.405]  You're going to get into another unraveling.
[01:11:24.465 --> 01:11:28.546]  In other words, another phase of the panic, another wave of panic will emerge.
[01:11:28.906 --> 01:11:34.228]  And then they're going to come forward and demand a trillion more, or two trillion more, or whatever it is.
[01:11:34.268 --> 01:11:38.190]  So the important thing is to build a movement around these ideas.
[01:11:38.330 --> 01:11:39.970]  And let's be clear, they are cannibal.
[01:11:40.010 --> 01:11:44.572]  And while I agree, as things get worse, I've never seen people as angry as they now are, Webster.
[01:11:45.132 --> 01:12:03.503]  about this people are really seeing through it nine percent support this in major polls multiple polls show that same number but the establishment both parties are showing us who they are and so as this gets worse know the blame the international oligarchs the anglo-american establishment and then out of that somehow bring them to justice now
[01:12:04.604 --> 01:12:08.687]  We're going to go to break it a little bit, but I want to first toot your horn here because I have to say something.
[01:12:09.068 --> 01:12:10.389]  I really respect you, Webster.
[01:12:10.709 --> 01:12:12.030]  I've read many of your books.
[01:12:12.591 --> 01:12:16.774]  Your unauthorized biography of George Bush Sr., the book on Obama.
[01:12:16.794 --> 01:12:18.075]  You've got a new book out on Obama.
[01:12:18.115 --> 01:12:21.899]  I haven't had a chance to read that yet, but I remember you almost a year ago.
[01:12:23.211 --> 01:12:29.473]  When Obama wasn't even a front-runner yet, wasn't even one of the top people yet, saying, watch Obama, watch Obama, watch Obama.
[01:12:30.253 --> 01:12:32.034]  Now Obama became the nominee.
[01:12:32.514 --> 01:12:37.135]  You're saying, watch for fascism, watch for street thugs beating you up for talking bad about him.
[01:12:37.495 --> 01:12:40.856]  Watch for the police saying you're not allowed to talk bad about Obama.
[01:12:41.156 --> 01:12:44.477]  And I remember going on Webster, even on air, I go, you're going too far.
[01:12:44.517 --> 01:12:46.098]  They're both puppets, they're both evil.
[01:12:46.718 --> 01:12:48.618]  I'm not going to say I support either one of them.
[01:12:48.658 --> 01:12:50.599]  They both are bought and paid for by Wall Street.
[01:12:51.239 --> 01:12:53.502]  I said, Webster, you know, I don't know where you get this.
[01:12:53.743 --> 01:12:58.729]  So we're going to go to break and come back and play a news clip and read what the governor of Missouri said about this.
[01:12:58.790 --> 01:13:00.051]  This is really happening now.
[01:13:00.412 --> 01:13:03.296]  But first, I want to know, how did you know that?
[01:13:03.356 --> 01:13:04.257]  I mean, that is like...
[01:13:04.924 --> 01:13:12.194]  That is like predicting who's gonna win the Indy 500, who's gonna win second, third, and fourth place, you know, in 2020.
[01:13:12.554 --> 01:13:14.216]  I mean, how did you know this?
[01:13:14.557 --> 01:13:15.218]  Thank you very much.
[01:13:15.238 --> 01:13:17.400]  You're making me look a little bit too good.
[01:13:17.541 --> 01:13:20.524]  I did not really understand Obama until about the 7th or 8th of January.
[01:13:22.026 --> 01:13:31.817]  So, in 2007... Okay, 10 months ago, all I know is that you were saying 3-4 months ago, 5-6 months ago, that exactly what's happening is now happening.
[01:13:32.017 --> 01:13:35.101]  Yeah, say 9 or 10 months ago, but here's the idea.
[01:13:35.541 --> 01:13:37.163]  I had lived in Central Europe.
[01:13:37.203 --> 01:13:43.150]  I've lived in Italy, lived in Germany, and I've really read a lot about the history of fascism and the early history.
[01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:50.154]  Italian fascism 1919 to 1922, German Nazism in the late 20s up until 1933.
[01:13:50.194 --> 01:13:52.295]  The Italian case is a very good one.
[01:13:52.715 --> 01:13:54.296]  Mussolini was a leftist.
[01:13:54.497 --> 01:13:54.917]  He was a socialist.
[01:13:54.937 --> 01:14:03.502]  He was a revolutionary socialist and his movement was made up of radical trade unionists, disgruntled war veterans from the special forces,
[01:14:04.282 --> 01:14:15.405]  Artists, intellectuals, sculptors, and revolutionary socialists who wanted Italy to join World War I. And that's what came together in Milan in 1919.
[01:14:15.765 --> 01:14:21.246]  So it's not a group of right-wing businessmen, although of course they pay for it.
[01:14:21.926 --> 01:14:25.347]  You've got to understand fascism is not a top-down phenomenon.
[01:14:25.667 --> 01:14:27.207]  It's a gutter phenomenon.
[01:14:27.247 --> 01:14:31.188]  It's a grassroots, anti-establishment, anti-authoritarian...
[01:14:47.737 --> 01:14:51.639]  Hooligans and fervently idealistic students.
[01:14:51.699 --> 01:14:55.362]  That would be a good summary of what fascist movements look like at the beginning.
[01:14:55.822 --> 01:15:01.305]  I'm stressing at the beginning, because once fascism takes power, these people more or less get mowed down.
[01:15:01.505 --> 01:15:04.327]  You know, Hitler just killed them all a couple of years ago.
[01:15:04.367 --> 01:15:05.688]  Because they're the troublemakers.
[01:15:05.948 --> 01:15:07.929]  Yeah, they're going to be uncontrollable.
[01:15:07.949 --> 01:15:08.450]  They're the useful idiots.
[01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:09.870]  They're not going to be happy when they get betrayed.
[01:15:09.890 --> 01:15:15.034]  There were people in the Nazi movement who wanted a second revolution, and Hitler was not going to go for that.
[01:15:16.286 --> 01:15:19.088]  So, yeah, exactly, the brown shirt.
[01:15:20.009 --> 01:15:23.732]  But in the early phase, fascism is radical.
[01:15:24.052 --> 01:15:25.794]  A lot of people think it's refreshing.
[01:15:25.934 --> 01:15:26.574]  It's new.
[01:15:27.715 --> 01:15:29.437]  It's a wonderful thing for many people.
[01:15:29.737 --> 01:15:40.025]  Alright, but I want to specifically understand how you knew, because for those that don't know, the police are saying, if you basically talk bad about Obama, they are going to arrest you.
[01:15:40.106 --> 01:15:41.427]  You cannot make this up.
[01:15:41.787 --> 01:15:42.948]  It's in multiple states.
[01:15:43.607 --> 01:15:48.375]  Tarpley was talking about it months ago, saying it was going on, but he couldn't document it in mainstream news.
[01:15:48.896 --> 01:15:51.561]  Now it's out there, and I mean, this is off the charts.
[01:15:52.022 --> 01:15:54.225]  This is off the charts, which you're about to hear when we get back.
[01:15:54.526 --> 01:15:54.926]  Stay with us.
[01:15:58.875 --> 01:16:03.299]  As a parent, your biggest fear is getting a phone call that your child has been attacked or worse.
[01:16:03.779 --> 01:16:08.704]  With your child going to college or moving out on their own, it's important to keep these safety tips in mind.
[01:16:09.264 --> 01:16:11.086]  Teach them to be aware of their surroundings.
[01:16:11.526 --> 01:16:13.608]  Walk on well-lit paths with friends or students.
[01:16:14.228 --> 01:16:16.892]  Secure the windows and doors of their dorm room or apartment.
[01:16:17.233 --> 01:16:18.755]  Know how to reach campus security.
[01:16:19.176 --> 01:16:22.300]  Always tell someone where they're going and when to expect their return.
[01:16:22.721 --> 01:16:25.064]  And always carry a self-defense device.
[01:16:25.545 --> 01:16:28.469]  This important message is brought to you by Pepperspray.com.

[01:17:00.291 --> 01:17:01.333]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:17:01.733 --> 01:17:07.220]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:08.301]  That's right.
[01:17:08.621 --> 01:17:11.265]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:17:11.465 --> 01:17:18.393]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:17:18.934 --> 01:17:26.620]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:31.924]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:17:32.545 --> 01:17:37.969]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:17:38.369 --> 01:17:42.493]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:17:42.893 --> 01:17:43.133]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:17:43.153 --> 01:17:44.975]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:17:48.217 --> 01:17:48.478]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:17:48.498 --> 01:17:48.698]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:17:59.153 --> 01:18:08.798]  Since the year 2000, earthquakes, heat waves, droughts, tsunamis, floods, fires, and hurricanes have killed over 1 million people worldwide and forced tens of millions to go without food and water.
[01:18:08.998 --> 01:18:13.040]  After Katrina, the media was eager to show victims in New Orleans begging for food.
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:17.883]  If a disaster strikes you and your loved ones and you have no stored food, you'll be begging as well.
[01:18:18.143 --> 01:18:24.126]  Now our economy is slipping into an abyss that even Donald Trump says will make the Great Depression look like a Sunday picnic.
[01:18:24.306 --> 01:18:24.706]  The U.S.
[01:18:24.746 --> 01:18:27.427]  dollar is worth less today than it was even last week.
[01:18:27.608 --> 01:18:33.710]  Before food prices skyrocket, trucks stop running, and stores close their doors, Survival Enterprises can help you prepare.
[01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:36.932]  They're master distributors of Mountain House freeze-dried food.
[01:18:37.032 --> 01:18:45.196]  With up to a 50-year shelf life, Survival Enterprises has real butter, cheese and bread, real beef, chicken and turkey, all canned for long-term storage.
[01:18:45.376 --> 01:18:47.116]  For their website and more info, call 1-800-753-1981.
[01:18:47.136 --> 01:18:47.477]  That's 1-800-753-1981.
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:58.072]  1981 and remember if you wait until you need us it's too late call now
[01:18:59.381 --> 01:19:02.704]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[01:19:03.144 --> 01:19:07.748]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[01:19:08.169 --> 01:19:13.413]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[01:19:13.633 --> 01:19:24.182]  Though the people of the U.S., where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reigning them in and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[01:19:24.643 --> 01:19:25.864]  They are called Illuminati.
[01:19:26.284 --> 01:19:28.626]  Elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[01:19:29.006 --> 01:19:31.468]  They oppose everything that is God and Truth.
[01:19:31.788 --> 01:19:35.030]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[01:19:35.350 --> 01:19:47.939]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the Earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.
[01:19:48.359 --> 01:19:51.841]  Visit our website at unveilingthem.com.
[01:19:52.101 --> 01:19:55.964]  That's U-N-V-E-I-L-I-N-G them dot com.
[01:19:56.444 --> 01:20:13.178]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:20:13.318 --> 01:20:15.119]  What are we talking about, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:20:15.139 --> 01:20:22.025]  Well, this is Governor Blunt's statement on Obama campaign's abuse of use of Missouri law enforcement.
[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:29.624]  Now, remember when George Bush put people in free speech zones five miles away so they can't protest, we're against it here.
[01:20:30.005 --> 01:20:35.969]  That's a violation against the Bill of Rights, what our veterans have fought and died for, everything that makes us a free and safe society.
[01:20:36.689 --> 01:20:39.611]  From the greatest threat to humanity, tyranny from government.
[01:20:41.452 --> 01:20:44.855]  But remember Bill Clinton, how bad he was, and, oh, George Bush is going to save us.
[01:20:45.335 --> 01:20:46.576]  And I was neutral on that.
[01:20:46.636 --> 01:20:47.596]  I said, I don't think so.
[01:20:47.616 --> 01:20:48.577]  These guys are just puppets.
[01:20:48.597 --> 01:20:49.698]  And then it was so much worse.
[01:20:50.427 --> 01:20:53.370]  Well, it can get a lot worse after that, folks, with Barack Obama.
[01:20:53.970 --> 01:21:02.078]  And I'm not even saying, I'm not, I've said I'm not going to vote for either one, but I'll tell you, what I'm seeing here makes me question that.
[01:21:02.378 --> 01:21:03.139]  Not that it matters.
[01:21:03.199 --> 01:21:05.421]  Most areas of the country are electronic voting machines.
[01:21:05.842 --> 01:21:10.186]  They've been proven to be involved in fraud, so it, I mean, that's why we're under so much tyranny.
[01:21:10.586 --> 01:21:14.530]  That's why 91% of the American people don't want the bailout, but they're doing it!
[01:21:15.189 --> 01:21:16.930]  Or 91% in a Gallup poll?
[01:21:16.970 --> 01:21:17.450]  Same number.
[01:21:17.650 --> 01:21:18.430]  Don't want open borders?
[01:21:18.450 --> 01:21:18.950]  They're doing it.
[01:21:19.390 --> 01:21:20.951]  They just do what the elite want.
[01:21:21.011 --> 01:21:22.331]  But listen to the Governor.
[01:21:23.231 --> 01:21:33.834]  Governor Matt Blunt today issued a following statement on news reports that have exposed plans by Senator Barack Obama to use Missouri law enforcement to threaten and intimidate his critics.
[01:21:33.894 --> 01:21:37.195]  This is from governor.mo.gov.
[01:21:38.416 --> 01:21:40.116]  And this is Missouri Governor.
[01:21:40.956 --> 01:21:41.176]  St.
[01:21:41.216 --> 01:21:43.437]  Louis City Circuit Attorney
[01:21:44.708 --> 01:21:46.710]  Bob McCulloch, St.
[01:21:46.750 --> 01:22:05.022]  Louis City Circuit Attorney Jennifer Joyce, Jefferson County Sheriff Glenn Boyer, and Obama, and the leader of the Missouri campaign, Senator Clary McCaskill, they're all on TV and multiple newscasts, folks, have attached the stench of police state tactics to the Obama-Biden campaign.
[01:22:05.483 --> 01:22:06.604]  That is the governor!
[01:22:07.484 --> 01:22:09.786]  Now, I saw this Friday
[01:22:10.993 --> 01:22:21.120]  And then again Saturday I made more calls, and you can call the Obama campaign in Missouri, you can call them nationally, and they will say on the phone, yes, we want to arrest people that talk bad about Obama.
[01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:24.082]  I mean, you can't make this up!
[01:22:24.602 --> 01:22:26.623]  You can't make this up!
[01:22:28.404 --> 01:22:33.508]  When Senator Obama and his helpers are doing a scandalous beyond words,
[01:22:35.029 --> 01:22:38.111]  Again, what Senator Obama and his helpers are doing is scandalous beyond words.
[01:22:38.572 --> 01:22:48.299]  The party that claims to be the party of Thomas Jefferson is abusing the justice system and offices of public trust to silence political criticism with threats of prosecution and criminal punishment.
[01:22:49.100 --> 01:22:57.546]  This abuse of law for intimidating insults the most sacred principles and ideals of Jefferson.
[01:22:57.927 --> 01:23:03.731]  I can think of nothing more offensive to Jefferson's thinking than using the power of the state to deprive Americans of their civil rights.
[01:23:04.131 --> 01:23:04.612]  The only
[01:23:05.469 --> 01:23:19.490]  The conceivable purpose of Obama and others is to frighten people away from expressing themselves, to chill free speech and open debate, to suppress support and donations to conservative organizations targeted by this anti-civil rights.
[01:23:22.617 --> 01:23:35.995]  To strangle criticism of Mr. Obama, to suppress ads about his support of higher taxes, and to choke out criticism on television, radio, the internet, blogs, email, and daily conversation about the election.
[01:23:37.003 --> 01:23:38.424]  Barack Obama needs to grow up.
[01:23:38.805 --> 01:23:42.548]  Leftist blogs and others in the press constantly say false things about me and my family.
[01:23:42.949 --> 01:23:47.173]  Usually we ignore false, scurrilous accusations because the purveyors have no credibility.
[01:23:47.373 --> 01:23:48.594]  When necessary, we refute them.
[01:23:49.034 --> 01:23:55.961]  Enlisting Missouri law enforcement to intimidate people to kill free debate is reminiscent of the Sedition Acts, not a free society.
[01:23:56.441 --> 01:23:59.144]  Now, let's go ahead and play about a two-minute newscast.
[01:23:59.504 --> 01:24:02.547]  This is just one of many
[01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:08.362]  From NBC News 4, out of St.
[01:24:08.422 --> 01:24:09.243]  Louis, here it is.
[01:24:10.263 --> 01:24:19.728]  Senator Barack Obama's presidential campaign is asking Missouri law enforcement to target anyone who lies or runs a misleading television ad during the presidential campaign.
[01:24:20.069 --> 01:24:22.610]  First, John Mills is live at the county election board in Maplewood.
[01:24:22.630 --> 01:24:27.312]  He's been learning more about which members of law enforcement are getting involved in this.
[01:24:27.332 --> 01:24:28.233]  John, tell us more about this.
[01:24:29.002 --> 01:24:29.622]  Russell, good evening.
[01:24:29.722 --> 01:24:35.786]  Prosecutors and sheriffs from across Missouri are joining something called the Barack Obama Truth Squad.
[01:24:36.126 --> 01:24:39.368]  Two high-profile prosecutors are part of the team.
[01:24:39.688 --> 01:24:42.129]  We met them this afternoon in the Central West End.
[01:24:42.489 --> 01:24:45.691]  They are Jennifer Joyce from the city, Bob McCullough, the St.
[01:24:45.711 --> 01:24:47.332]  Louis County prosecuting attorney.
[01:24:47.372 --> 01:24:54.236]  They will be reminding voters that Barack Obama is a Christian who wants to cut taxes for anyone making less than $250,000 a year.
[01:24:56.517 --> 01:25:03.991]  They also say they plan to respond immediately to any ads and statements that might violate Missouri ethics laws.
[01:25:05.618 --> 01:25:08.079]  We want to keep this campaign focused on issues.
[01:25:08.539 --> 01:25:14.081]  We don't want people to get distracted, and the Missourians don't want to be distracted by these divisive character attacks.
[01:25:14.201 --> 01:25:18.883]  So we're here to respond to any character attacks, to set the record straight.
[01:25:19.003 --> 01:25:27.286]  Whether it is directly attributable to the campaign or to one of the soft money operations, if they're not going to tell the truth, then somebody's got to step up and say, wait a minute.
[01:25:27.486 --> 01:25:28.306]  Alright, that's enough.
[01:25:28.326 --> 01:25:29.766]  It goes on and on.
[01:25:29.826 --> 01:25:33.888]  Now, I've called the campaign, I've called the local campaign, I've called these offices.
[01:25:34.669 --> 01:25:38.557]  And they say, if you say that Barack Obama wants to raise taxes, you get arrested.
[01:25:39.494 --> 01:25:42.256]  Now, Obama's said over and over again he wants all sorts of new taxes.
[01:25:42.937 --> 01:25:44.478]  The guy is anti-gun.
[01:25:44.538 --> 01:25:49.961]  He said ban 30-odd, 6 rounds, 223, ban most rifles and handguns.
[01:25:50.302 --> 01:25:51.062]  That's on record.
[01:25:51.102 --> 01:25:51.983]  Am I going to get arrested?
[01:25:52.523 --> 01:25:55.585]  The point is, even if that wasn't true, they'd have to civilly go after me.
[01:25:55.846 --> 01:25:57.647]  This is a direct attack on the First Amendment.
[01:25:57.667 --> 01:26:03.611]  It also shows how warped the police are to think that they're allowed to come to control what you can and can't say.
[01:26:04.031 --> 01:26:05.132]  Now, understand something.
[01:26:05.392 --> 01:26:07.454]  This is going on in Illinois, in New York,
[01:26:07.914 --> 01:26:08.715]  And in other states.
[01:26:08.775 --> 01:26:09.876]  This is not just here.
[01:26:10.396 --> 01:26:11.817]  And this is a concerted effort.
[01:26:12.198 --> 01:26:15.561]  Webster Tarpley, this is just unbelievable.
[01:26:15.981 --> 01:26:21.385]  And then to have a governor come out and say that this is a police state tactic, a chilling effect tactic.
[01:26:22.106 --> 01:26:23.467]  At first, I didn't believe this Friday.
[01:26:23.507 --> 01:26:24.368]  I made phone calls.
[01:26:24.828 --> 01:26:29.012]  They are there saying, basically, you're not allowed to talk bad about Barack Obama.
[01:26:29.172 --> 01:26:33.816]  And they're saying, if you have a bumper sticker saying he's a Muslim, which his dad was, and he did go to Muslim schools,
[01:26:34.296 --> 01:26:36.659]  I mean, you know, certainly somebody has a right to their opinion.
[01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:39.282]  I mean, is that what America's come to?
[01:26:39.362 --> 01:26:42.686]  I mean, you said that he would do exactly stuff like this.
[01:26:42.726 --> 01:26:43.407]  How did you know that?
[01:26:44.316 --> 01:26:50.978]  Again, it's partly the comparison to Italian fascism at the beginning, to the other forms of fascism.
[01:26:51.018 --> 01:27:00.581]  You can look at the Iron Guard in Romania of Codriano, or the French under Pétain, or the Spanish under Franco, or the Portuguese under Salazar.
[01:27:00.641 --> 01:27:01.281]  It's all the same.
[01:27:01.661 --> 01:27:06.503]  You've also got to look at these people power coups or color revolutions.
[01:27:07.083 --> 01:27:17.193]  What Obama is basically doing, the structure of the Obama campaign has been refined in things like the Roses Revolution in Tiflis, Georgia, the Orange Revolution in Kiev.
[01:27:18.074 --> 01:27:19.615]  It's a CIA coup.
[01:27:19.815 --> 01:27:21.877]  And, oh, that's what you pointed out nine months ago.
[01:27:21.977 --> 01:27:29.044]  He has the exact people that run those coups running his campaign has gotten three times the Wall Street money that McCain has.
[01:27:29.304 --> 01:27:32.127]  So you've been saying he's their candidate, but you said repeatedly.
[01:27:32.447 --> 01:27:39.469]  And you also have written about it, that they would use the police with local support to go after people that criticized them.
[01:27:39.529 --> 01:27:40.469]  How did you know that?
[01:27:40.769 --> 01:27:41.850]  Because it's now happening.
[01:27:42.090 --> 01:27:54.874]  Well, I write about this in detail in the two books, Obama, The Postmodern Coup, and Barack H. Obama, The Unauthorized Biography, which are available in various internet sources, Amazon and also at your shop, Alex.
[01:27:55.174 --> 01:27:56.234]  Infowars.com, yeah.
[01:27:56.694 --> 01:27:59.596]  Uh, the idea is that that's the historical pattern.
[01:27:59.996 --> 01:28:03.939]  It's a movement of goons who have a political goal and they're in league with the police.
[01:28:04.259 --> 01:28:10.723]  See, you reach a point with a society like this where if you want to use the police for repression, there may not be enough.
[01:28:11.204 --> 01:28:14.806]  And if you want to bring in the army, the army may not be reliable.
[01:28:14.906 --> 01:28:19.068]  It's a way to organize a population to oppress itself around the hysteria of certain ideas, which in the case of Obama,
[01:28:36.255 --> 01:28:38.236]  I've made a list of 10 or 12 points.
[01:28:38.316 --> 01:28:42.998]  Yeah, let's go over and we come back and let's talk about what life under Obama is going to be like.
[01:28:43.358 --> 01:28:49.160]  Because you talk about being, you're going to be firebombed, attacked, arrested, shot, beaten to death, and no one's going to help you.
[01:28:49.660 --> 01:28:50.661]  Okay, this is the Bankers.
[01:28:50.781 --> 01:28:51.321]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:00.282 --> 01:29:02.524]  They say you can't predict the stock market.
[01:29:02.844 --> 01:29:06.026]  If you trade on a regular basis, you've probably heard that lie.
[01:29:06.287 --> 01:29:11.511]  But what if I told you there's a way to know which way the market will go each week, a whole week in advance?
[01:29:11.931 --> 01:29:14.313]  Do you think you could benefit from this kind of information?
[01:29:14.693 --> 01:29:19.056]  The guys over at eminiforecaster.com put out a weekly forecast line.

[01:31:59.042 --> 01:32:00.884]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:32:01.024 --> 01:32:07.709]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:32:07.989 --> 01:32:16.156]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:32:16.376 --> 01:32:22.101]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:32:22.381 --> 01:32:24.062]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:32:24.122 --> 01:32:26.263]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:32:26.403 --> 01:32:30.665]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:32:30.825 --> 01:32:32.966]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:32:33.046 --> 01:32:40.589]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[01:33:17.382 --> 01:33:27.606]  Now, the Obama campaign tells News 4 that others, prosecutors and sheriffs, are also part of the team, including some from the Kansas City area and from rural parts of Missouri.
[01:33:27.786 --> 01:33:32.988]  We're also told the Truth Squad is expected to include Jefferson County Sheriff Glenn Boyer.
[01:33:33.488 --> 01:33:35.569]  Live in Maplewood, John Mills, News 4.
[01:33:35.789 --> 01:33:36.549]  John, thank you.
[01:33:37.750 --> 01:33:39.290]  And we've got other newscasts out of St.
[01:33:39.330 --> 01:33:39.591]  Louis.
[01:33:39.611 --> 01:33:40.511]  I think that's closer to
[01:33:43.112 --> 01:33:43.852]  Kansas City.
[01:33:44.292 --> 01:33:45.813]  There's a whole bunch of these news clips.
[01:33:45.833 --> 01:33:46.813]  You can go up and watch them.
[01:33:47.293 --> 01:33:54.495]  We have an article up on InfoWars.com titled, Tell the Truth About Obama and Missouri Go to Jail.
[01:33:55.475 --> 01:34:00.417]  You can also call the Obama campaign yourself and they say, yeah.
[01:34:02.037 --> 01:34:08.139]  We say when you're lying, no judge, no jury, no civil case, we just come arrest you.
[01:34:09.326 --> 01:34:14.432]  Now, Webster, you've got a list of serious issues with Obama and the fascism and who's behind him.
[01:34:16.214 --> 01:34:25.665]  But also, there's a lot of other examples of the intimidation and the thug tactics and people being arrested for criticizing Obama before.
[01:34:26.832 --> 01:34:28.454]  Yeah, you want to go through a couple of those?
[01:34:28.474 --> 01:34:29.455]  Yeah, let's do it.
[01:34:29.535 --> 01:34:35.881]  It's kind of a coincidence, but I got a report from a friend of mine, Greg Nixon, an investigative journalist in Burlington, Vermont.
[01:34:36.502 --> 01:34:42.428]  A week ago Sunday, in the pedestrian zone in the center of Burlington, Vermont, this is Obama country, right?
[01:34:42.448 --> 01:34:46.933]  Richard Leedis, Howard Dean and company, and Bernie Sanders run the state.
[01:34:47.794 --> 01:34:50.638]  A guy is a graduate student in electrical engineering.
[01:34:50.698 --> 01:34:52.822]  He's not an incendiary.
[01:34:52.842 --> 01:34:53.923]  He's not a provocateur.
[01:34:54.444 --> 01:34:59.773]  He walks up to a group of middle-aged women who are doing a book table for Obama in the pedestrian zone.
[01:34:59.813 --> 01:35:02.337]  Now, in order to be there, you've got to get a permit from the city.
[01:35:02.857 --> 01:35:08.199]  So he says, what is the story about your man Obama being close to his big new Brzezinski?
[01:35:08.739 --> 01:35:10.480]  And they say, well, they get off.
[01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:11.360]  They don't want to answer that.
[01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:12.540]  The guy walks away.
[01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:13.581]  There's no incident.
[01:35:14.081 --> 01:35:14.801]  He walks away.
[01:35:14.841 --> 01:35:16.242]  He's about a block away.
[01:35:16.642 --> 01:35:17.842]  The police come after him.
[01:35:18.562 --> 01:35:28.886]  The middle-aged ladies of the Obama table have called the cops, telling him, perhaps under a program like this thing that we're hearing about in Missouri now,
[01:35:29.657 --> 01:35:41.605]  They tell him, uh, you're under arrest, uh, for, uh, they don't say for what, and the guy says, but you can't be serious, and then they grab him, they throw him in jail for 36 hours, and now he's got a court date.
[01:35:41.966 --> 01:35:44.648]  And there's, I've sent you a press release about this, Alex.
[01:35:44.668 --> 01:35:47.049]  Yeah, through that source, I'm gonna get him on the weekday show.
[01:35:47.069 --> 01:35:47.530]  Absolutely.
[01:35:47.550 --> 01:35:49.211]  Coming up, but now it's not just that.
[01:35:50.131 --> 01:35:54.574]  We had this other gentleman saying that he'd done drugs with Obama, then he gets arrested.
[01:35:54.594 --> 01:35:56.836]  I mean, they're not playing games.
[01:35:56.876 --> 01:35:57.917]  Let's talk about that one, too.
[01:35:57.957 --> 01:35:59.378]  I think that's a very egregious one.
[01:35:59.398 --> 01:36:00.639]  This is Larry Sinclair.
[01:36:00.659 --> 01:36:02.640]  He's a gay man from Minnesota.
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:08.124]  And he, in mid-January, put up this tape on the Internet, which has been seen by many millions of people.
[01:36:08.644 --> 01:36:12.665]  It said, in 1999, I had two homosexual encounters with Obama.
[01:36:13.045 --> 01:36:17.106]  Obama carries his own crack pipe, pulled it out, and smoked crack cocaine.
[01:36:17.466 --> 01:36:20.167]  He came here to the Washington National Press Club.
[01:36:20.187 --> 01:36:23.087]  By the way, Obama admits that he's done a lot of heavy drugs in the past.
[01:36:23.127 --> 01:36:27.108]  Yes, cocaine and marijuana, but he says he never injected.
[01:36:27.868 --> 01:36:28.568]  He didn't inject.
[01:36:29.288 --> 01:36:31.129]  But Sinclair was here on June 18th.
[01:36:32.009 --> 01:36:40.033]  He gave his presentation in the National Press Club before he even left the premises of this temple of the First Amendment and freedom of the press.
[01:36:40.433 --> 01:36:52.358]  He was arrested on a fake warrant that had been hooked up by Beau Biden, the corrupt, nepotist son of Joe Biden, currently the Democratic vice presidential candidate.
[01:36:52.618 --> 01:36:54.179]  Larry Sinclair was dragged off.
[01:36:54.219 --> 01:36:58.421]  He spent the next four or five days... And by the way, it came out it was fake later.
[01:36:58.841 --> 01:36:59.662]  In the D.C.
[01:36:59.702 --> 01:37:00.102]  Jail!
[01:37:00.122 --> 01:37:00.943]  Fake arrests now!
[01:37:01.003 --> 01:37:03.744]  Please don't arrest me, police, when I leave here if we're talking about Obama.
[01:37:03.764 --> 01:37:05.205]  I mean, this country's gone, man.
[01:37:05.225 --> 01:37:08.408]  Yeah, well, this is why Obama really is worse.
[01:37:08.768 --> 01:37:11.570]  I mean, McCain has all kinds of problems, I'd be the first to say.
[01:37:11.850 --> 01:37:15.252]  But I don't see this kind of enemies list operation.
[01:37:15.292 --> 01:37:15.812]  Well, no, that's it.
[01:37:15.873 --> 01:37:17.594]  McCain will have no support.
[01:37:17.654 --> 01:37:19.115]  Everybody will hate him day one.
[01:37:19.435 --> 01:37:20.656]  The state will have no power.
[01:37:20.696 --> 01:37:22.317]  But you're right, the system loves
[01:37:22.977 --> 01:37:23.918]  Somebody tattling.
[01:37:24.418 --> 01:37:28.001]  I mean, if a neighbor says they did something to their kid, no evidence, the cops will take it.
[01:37:28.341 --> 01:37:29.081]  You know, the child.
[01:37:29.141 --> 01:37:34.805]  But if... I mean, why does the police state love having the citizens involved?
[01:37:34.945 --> 01:37:36.346]  Well, because it gives them less coverage.
[01:37:36.366 --> 01:37:37.347]  Just a couple of examples.
[01:37:37.407 --> 01:37:40.529]  Harold Simmons has got this group called American Issues.
[01:37:40.589 --> 01:37:45.693]  He's a rich right-winger, and he wanted to put some very useful ads on television about Obama
[01:37:46.073 --> 01:37:52.843]  And it really is true that he's neck deep in all these known terrorists.
[01:37:52.863 --> 01:37:53.124]  Absolutely.
[01:37:53.184 --> 01:37:55.567]  Bill Ayers is a weatherman, terrorist, bomber.
[01:37:55.648 --> 01:37:57.350]  Actually a cop killer, I would say.
[01:38:02.057 --> 01:38:07.619]  Obama owes his career to Bill Ayers, who made him the head of the Chicago Analyst Association.
[01:38:07.639 --> 01:38:07.999]  But that's okay!
[01:38:08.019 --> 01:38:09.359]  The cops are going to love him because he's a cop.
[01:38:09.379 --> 01:38:12.300]  This is all in my book, Barack H. Obama, The Unauthorized Biography.
[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:22.424]  So, when Harold Simmons puts these things on television, the Obama campaign writes to the Justice Department saying, we want you to arrest Harold Simmons and the people at this 527 group.
[01:38:23.564 --> 01:38:25.025]  For criminal violations.
[01:38:25.385 --> 01:38:26.967]  We've already gone through Palin's email.
[01:38:27.007 --> 01:38:28.748]  We've gone through the Missouri case.
[01:38:29.328 --> 01:38:30.349]  WGN Chicago.
[01:38:30.389 --> 01:38:31.170]  This is very interesting.
[01:38:31.230 --> 01:38:34.913]  Milt Rosenberg is a former professor at the University of Chicago.
[01:38:34.973 --> 01:38:38.675]  He has a very intellectual, cerebral talk show at night.
[01:38:39.016 --> 01:38:40.837]  He has a guy on called Stanley Kurtz.
[01:38:40.897 --> 01:38:43.839]  He's a neocon from the National Review Online.
[01:38:44.260 --> 01:38:50.805]  And that guy has been going through the Obama, I'm sorry, the Chicago Annenberg Challenge Foundation papers.
[01:38:51.465 --> 01:38:53.926]  Annenberg Chicago Challenge was a divide and conquer thing.
[01:38:53.946 --> 01:38:58.889]  They wanted to play the black parents against the black teachers union against the government.
[01:39:14.957 --> 01:39:20.740]  Yeah, this is the Chicago Annenberg Challenge, which is... And they wouldn't allow the documents to come out, yeah.
[01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:22.041]  They withheld the documents.
[01:39:22.141 --> 01:39:25.223]  Kurtz made a big stink about it with the help of others, including myself.
[01:39:25.663 --> 01:39:29.585]  He went there and went through the papers, and he wanted to go on this program.
[01:39:29.825 --> 01:39:34.848]  So there's a thing called the Obama Action Line that put out this emergency call
[01:39:35.308 --> 01:39:36.569]  Oh yeah, that's the other issue!
[01:39:36.629 --> 01:39:38.271]  They want the Fairness Doctrine, which will shut down
[01:39:51.704 --> 01:39:53.045]  He's going to shut down all these radio shows.
[01:39:53.065 --> 01:39:53.525]  Exactly.
[01:39:54.085 --> 01:39:56.347]  And he said he's going to shut down the internet as well.
[01:39:57.267 --> 01:39:58.408]  So is McCain.
[01:39:58.428 --> 01:40:00.249]  We're going to have censorship.
[01:40:00.269 --> 01:40:05.672]  We're going to have political correctness under left cover with hate crimes and all the rest of this stuff.
[01:40:06.052 --> 01:40:09.214]  Anyway, they tried to shut down Milt Rosenberg on WGN.
[01:40:09.534 --> 01:40:20.721]  Let me also point out, and people may be listening can confirm this, in Texas, for the Texas Democratic Caucuses, as well as in the Iowa Caucuses and in other caucuses,
[01:40:21.161 --> 01:40:28.327]  There's a whole book full of hooligan activities by the Obama campaign.
[01:40:28.647 --> 01:40:32.410]  Locking people out, seizing control of caucuses.
[01:40:32.550 --> 01:40:48.722]  Well, remember in Berlin, everywhere they said no one is allowed to have signs, even supporting them so they couldn't have anti-Obama signs, and so there was no free speech there, and anybody who did pull another Hillary sign or Ron Paul out was arrested.
[01:40:49.389 --> 01:40:54.932]  There's another dimension which is Obama has three convicted felons that are his godfathers.
[01:40:59.799 --> 01:41:06.124]  And this guy, Nadhimi Aouchi, Resco is this gangster... And it is true his mother wasn't continually in the U.S.
[01:41:06.164 --> 01:41:09.787]  long enough to be able to have him in Kenya, so he is not eligible for the presidency.
[01:41:09.807 --> 01:41:11.448]  Yeah, but that's the Berkshire.
[01:41:11.468 --> 01:41:12.248]  We'll get to that in a minute.
[01:41:12.268 --> 01:41:13.950]  But just these three guys, right?
[01:41:14.430 --> 01:41:22.396]  Aouchi, Nadhimi Aouchi has a lawyer who is threatening people, threatening websites, threatening investigative journalists.
[01:41:22.756 --> 01:41:27.280]  You're not allowed to tell anything about Aouchi and his relations to Obama.
[01:41:27.380 --> 01:41:28.921]  Aouchi is involved in the biggest
[01:41:29.481 --> 01:41:36.224]  Yeah, everybody knows about Resco and all the communists and the rest of it and the house swapping and the rest of it, but look, the bottom line here is
[01:41:51.738 --> 01:41:53.640]  You've got McCain mobbed up with his wife.
[01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:55.421]  You've got him Keating 5.
[01:41:55.481 --> 01:41:58.044]  You've got him saying, use troops to confiscate guns.
[01:41:58.104 --> 01:42:03.168]  I mean, McCain's really bad, New World Order, open border promoting, you know, tax and spend guy.
[01:42:03.468 --> 01:42:06.851]  But, I mean, it is true, he is not the Hollywood type.
[01:42:06.871 --> 01:42:09.734]  He isn't, you know, sexy as the ad agencies say.
[01:42:10.334 --> 01:42:14.863]  And with this Obama, you literally do have a cult following.
[01:42:15.505 --> 01:42:19.071]  And I know some of the websites that went after him have been shut down.
[01:42:20.194 --> 01:42:21.075]  What about you, Webster?
[01:42:21.095 --> 01:42:21.717]  What's happened to you?
[01:42:23.067 --> 01:42:31.653]  I'm still here so far, but I would say that the criterion you have to use is who has a fascist mass movement or reasonable facsimile thereof.
[01:42:31.993 --> 01:42:32.613]  It's Obama.
[01:42:33.054 --> 01:42:35.495]  McCain is a garden variety reactionary.
[01:42:35.555 --> 01:42:36.996]  Nothing special.
[01:42:37.096 --> 01:42:38.017]  Nothing out of the ordinary.
[01:42:38.057 --> 01:42:40.539]  Similar to Bush in many ways.
[01:42:40.559 --> 01:42:45.202]  You're saying Obama could really have a Hitlerian dynamism.
[01:42:45.843 --> 01:42:50.046]  He would be able to lean on a fascist mass movement of Kool-Aid drinkers and fanatics.
[01:42:50.706 --> 01:42:51.847]  Yeah, well I know this.
[01:42:52.007 --> 01:42:54.608]  He is a gun grabber and I don't like him for that alone.
[01:42:54.889 --> 01:42:57.450]  We'll be right back to talk about Obama getting arrested.
[01:42:57.470 --> 01:42:58.351]  Stay with us.
[01:42:59.531 --> 01:43:00.132]  Question.
[01:43:00.372 --> 01:43:04.975]  Is the world getting better or vastly worse?
[01:43:05.055 --> 01:43:09.517]  The world economic collapse could come any day.
[01:43:09.577 --> 01:43:10.118]  Question.
[01:43:10.418 --> 01:43:14.020]  Are you prepared or are you ignoring the signs?
[01:43:15.701 --> 01:43:16.282]  Question.

[01:44:08.055 --> 01:44:11.859]  That's right, trillion dollars in mortgages held by these two corporations.
[01:44:12.620 --> 01:44:18.587]  The part that most people don't realize is that this bailout can have significant adverse effects on their 401ks and IRAs.
[01:44:20.208 --> 01:44:24.932]  Unless you're planning to help pay for this bailout with your personal retirement funds, you need to act now.

[01:44:59.428 --> 01:44:59.708]  Fact.
[01:44:59.908 --> 01:45:05.792]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[01:45:05.912 --> 01:45:10.154]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[01:45:10.234 --> 01:45:17.699]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[01:45:17.739 --> 01:45:17.879]  Yes.
[01:45:17.899 --> 01:45:18.539]  The solution.

[01:46:05.265 --> 01:46:07.585]  The chemtrails are spraying us with their chemicals.
[01:46:08.226 --> 01:46:09.966]  It's time to think about what is important.
[01:46:10.546 --> 01:46:12.747]  Most forget just how important life is.

[01:47:17.865 --> 01:47:23.390]  You know, most of the time, my wife is very upset that I do a Sunday show for two hours.
[01:47:23.410 --> 01:47:26.372]  But me, I'm upset it's not three or four hours.
[01:47:26.412 --> 01:47:27.994]  Maybe I should try to expand it.
[01:47:28.014 --> 01:47:30.135]  Because it's at times like these,
[01:47:31.258 --> 01:47:37.804]  I could go over 3 or 4 hours talking about this, and I know the phones have been loaded the whole show, and I haven't taken one phone call yet.
[01:47:38.304 --> 01:47:45.190]  Webster, I've got to have you back up next week on this particular show to finish up on this discussion, and I want to go to a few callers.
[01:47:45.611 --> 01:47:47.893]  Some of them are hopping mad at you.
[01:47:49.374 --> 01:47:52.537]  They're so angry they can't even articulate, but it has to do with Obama.
[01:47:53.698 --> 01:47:55.099]  One of them is Trooper from Austin.
[01:47:56.115 --> 01:47:57.556]  And a few others I want to go to.
[01:47:57.576 --> 01:48:08.361]  But I want to point out that Webster Tarpley is what you'd call a classical liberal, more of a FDR type.
[01:48:08.861 --> 01:48:10.482]  I mean, he's not a right-winger.
[01:48:11.082 --> 01:48:13.183]  I don't get into the whole left-right business.
[01:48:13.283 --> 01:48:17.345]  As you know, I'm more of a libertarian, and I've tried to sit out on this last election.
[01:48:18.025 --> 01:48:20.887]  Four years ago, I did as well because I'm dealing with issues.
[01:48:22.107 --> 01:48:25.449]  But Obama has something that no one's had since Reagan.
[01:48:26.477 --> 01:48:34.082]  And that's this cause celeb, this dynamic personality that they can lead.
[01:48:34.282 --> 01:48:36.924]  And it is true, there's more corporate money going to Obama.
[01:48:37.244 --> 01:48:44.789]  And now Obama's coming out and his campaign is saying, yeah, we decide if something isn't true, and then we have police who work for us come arrest you.
[01:48:45.650 --> 01:48:48.512]  And boy, I mean, that is hardcore tyranny.
[01:48:49.230 --> 01:48:55.275]  And you can really see the establishment lining things up to get rid of Bush, give you the Democrat, and move this in.
[01:48:55.315 --> 01:48:58.277]  But let's put Tarpley up and let's go to Trooper.
[01:48:58.697 --> 01:48:59.658]  Now Trooper, be nice.
[01:48:59.678 --> 01:49:01.440]  You were saying a lot of mean things about Webster.
[01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:04.762]  You're on air with him, but let's keep this civil.
[01:49:05.142 --> 01:49:06.183]  Go ahead and make your comment.
[01:49:06.984 --> 01:49:10.807]  Corsi, his friend, is a chicken-hawk swift boater.
[01:49:11.528 --> 01:49:15.451]  Tarpley is nothing but a scum-sucking swiftboater.
[01:49:16.071 --> 01:49:24.377]  And the reason you're so upset is because we're not going to sit back and let y'all swiftboat Obama the way you did Kerry.
[01:49:24.397 --> 01:49:25.778]  It's not going to happen.
[01:49:25.818 --> 01:49:26.779]  Hold on, Trooper.
[01:49:27.119 --> 01:49:29.220]  People, this is a serious call.
[01:49:29.381 --> 01:49:32.042]  I've run into Trooper at events over about 15 years.
[01:49:32.783 --> 01:49:34.404]  Trooper, he lives here in Austin.
[01:49:34.764 --> 01:49:39.888]  Trooper, you're telling me right now you agree with them arresting people for their speech?
[01:49:41.089 --> 01:49:44.151]  I just found out from your screener that he's not in the studio.
[01:49:44.311 --> 01:49:49.194]  I was personally going to come down there and arrest him for hate crimes.
[01:49:49.854 --> 01:49:50.534]  Is this a joke?
[01:49:50.835 --> 01:49:51.655]  No, it's no joke.
[01:49:51.695 --> 01:49:53.736]  Look, these people have to be stopped.
[01:49:54.617 --> 01:49:57.318]  They're the worst.
[01:49:57.538 --> 01:49:59.039]  Do you understand, Tripper?
[01:49:59.059 --> 01:50:00.800]  Hold on, put him on hold for a second.
[01:50:00.860 --> 01:50:01.661]  Hold on just a minute.
[01:50:07.555 --> 01:50:11.336]  Listen, it's prima facie evidence of evil.
[01:50:11.776 --> 01:50:15.657]  When they say you don't have a First Amendment, and if you criticize him, you get arrested.
[01:50:16.258 --> 01:50:18.278]  And now we... These are not lies.
[01:50:18.658 --> 01:50:22.679]  They never counter Dr. Corsi on any of the things he's claimed.
[01:50:23.039 --> 01:50:31.722]  They only attack him for something he said on a... Let me tell you, this is getting scary, Webster, because I... Let me also point out, I think Corsi has done some valuable things.
[01:50:32.322 --> 01:50:33.543]  I'm different from Corsi, though.
[01:50:33.703 --> 01:50:36.685]  I don't say that Obama is a communist or a Muslim.
[01:50:36.986 --> 01:50:40.328]  I say that he's a foundation operative, which is his career.
[01:50:40.348 --> 01:50:42.269]  He's a fake liberal fraud for the CIA.
[01:50:42.790 --> 01:50:46.873]  It's essentially the domestic counterinsurgency and counterintelligence apparatus.
[01:50:47.333 --> 01:50:49.534]  Obama is an agent of finance capital.
[01:50:49.794 --> 01:50:52.995]  Yeah, all you neocons that love government and love... Hold on, hold on.
[01:50:53.015 --> 01:50:53.935]  Rockefeller Soros & Company.
[01:50:54.135 --> 01:50:55.675]  Exactly, Rockefeller Soros & Company.
[01:50:55.915 --> 01:51:05.218]  For those that like secret prison camps and attacking innocent countries and think it's cute that Bush spies on us and has destroyed America, you should love Obama, shouldn't they?
[01:51:05.993 --> 01:51:08.514]  I mean, for those that love Bush, shouldn't they love Obama?
[01:51:08.854 --> 01:51:16.438]  The irony is that the people who have been fighting Bush this whole time have turned themselves into the post-modern fascists that they accused Bush of being.
[01:51:16.458 --> 01:51:20.059]  In the name of fighting that evil, meanwhile, Bush never ran anything and was a puppet.
[01:51:20.319 --> 01:51:27.202]  Okay, Trooper, I'm gonna give you the last word on this, but, uh... Let's go ahead and bring him back up.
[01:51:27.222 --> 01:51:29.303]  For some reason, I can't hear Trooper.
[01:51:29.944 --> 01:51:30.524]  Trooper, are you there?
[01:51:30.544 --> 01:51:31.104]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:51:31.584 --> 01:51:35.346]  Those are twisted lies, and the way I can explain it to you is this.
[01:51:36.340 --> 01:51:43.886]  You went to the Democratic Convention, and you protested, and I was so proud to hear you on the megaphone saying 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:51:44.226 --> 01:51:48.449]  But you couldn't go to the Republican one, or they'd bust your head and throw you in jail.
[01:51:48.489 --> 01:51:48.970]  That's true.
[01:51:49.290 --> 01:51:52.192]  Now that's who the real fascists are, not Obama.
[01:51:52.252 --> 01:52:02.140]  What about that point that he just made, and it's a bit tenuous because every city's different and every event's different, but it is true that we've had hyper-police state under the Republicans.
[01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:03.641]  I think Tarpley's saying
[01:52:04.261 --> 01:52:06.643]  You know, they're shifting gears now to another party.
[01:52:06.983 --> 01:52:14.307]  If you go back to 1922 or 1933, a lot of people said, oh, we thought it couldn't get any worse.
[01:52:14.647 --> 01:52:16.729]  We thought we were already under fascism.
[01:52:17.049 --> 01:52:18.370]  And then we went off the cliff.
[01:52:18.750 --> 01:52:21.311]  The top-down police state stuff, of course, is bad.
[01:52:21.371 --> 01:52:21.932]  I'm against it.
[01:52:22.532 --> 01:52:35.102]  But the gutter movement, the mass movement of anti-establishment fanatics, in other words, the Obamazoid fanatics, the Kool-Aid drinkers, and this lemming cult that he has, that's worse!
[01:52:35.342 --> 01:52:36.583]  Hey, hey, hey, Trooper!
[01:52:36.603 --> 01:52:37.023]  Trooper!
[01:52:37.063 --> 01:52:37.423]  Trooper!
[01:52:37.644 --> 01:52:38.865]  Hold on, Trooper!
[01:52:38.965 --> 01:52:39.765]  I don't know you!
[01:52:39.785 --> 01:52:40.626]  Hold on, Trooper!
[01:52:40.666 --> 01:52:41.667]  Put him back on hold!
[01:52:42.647 --> 01:52:48.452]  Now, Trooper, I don't know you really well, but I've probably run into you maybe ten times at events and football games over the years, and you're an Austin character.
[01:52:49.341 --> 01:52:52.905]  And you seem like a nice fella, but you're proving Webster Tarpley's point here.
[01:52:53.506 --> 01:53:06.441]  If you're really saying right now that you wish you could come physically arrest Webster Tarpley for what he's saying, even if it was a lie, even if it was wrong, it's his First Amendment, Trouper.
[01:53:06.461 --> 01:53:07.363]  Don't you understand?
[01:53:07.543 --> 01:53:09.165]  You're proving Tarpley's point right now.
[01:53:09.585 --> 01:53:10.506]  You can't fire in a theater.
[01:53:10.546 --> 01:53:13.650]  You can't slander people and lie like they're doing.
[01:53:13.670 --> 01:53:15.091]  Yeah, absolutely, Trooper.
[01:53:15.131 --> 01:53:17.253]  I appreciate your call, but absolutely you can.
[01:53:17.574 --> 01:53:20.137]  Number one, everything Darply's saying I've seen documented.
[01:53:20.897 --> 01:53:26.624]  Number two, it is not fire in a theater to say that Barack Obama wants to ban all .308 cartridges and .223.
[01:53:30.310 --> 01:53:32.631]  There's also a case to be made that Obama's a liar.
[01:53:33.031 --> 01:53:37.513]  If you look at issues like Iraq, FISA... Yeah, he said he was against the war, but now he's for it.
[01:53:37.693 --> 01:53:42.835]  He said he was against FISA, warrantless spying, and pardons for the criminals.
[01:53:42.895 --> 01:53:43.595]  Now he's for it.
[01:53:43.956 --> 01:53:45.516]  But I guess we should be arrested, Webster.
[01:53:45.716 --> 01:53:46.136]  You know something?
[01:53:46.176 --> 01:53:47.497]  He just proved your point, Webster.
[01:53:47.817 --> 01:53:49.658]  There's also this point about Christianity.
[01:53:49.978 --> 01:53:52.179]  He says he became a Christian through Reverend Wright.
[01:53:52.519 --> 01:53:57.301]  I would have to say, Reverend Wright preaches a religion of hatred, which is incompatible to Christianity.
[01:53:57.321 --> 01:53:59.622]  Well, I actually agree with a lot of what Wright says about AIDS and stuff.
[01:54:00.162 --> 01:54:00.822]  Hold on, hold on.
[01:54:00.842 --> 01:54:01.422]  It's not hatred.
[01:54:01.482 --> 01:54:03.703]  Goddamn America is where I draw the line.
[01:54:03.843 --> 01:54:04.963]  That's a religion of hatred.
[01:54:04.983 --> 01:54:05.283]  Okay, stop, stop.
[01:54:05.323 --> 01:54:06.604]  And Christianity does not allow hatred.
[01:54:06.624 --> 01:54:07.984]  The show's almost over, Webster.
[01:54:08.024 --> 01:54:08.924]  Gotta cut it off there.
[01:54:08.944 --> 01:54:10.524]  We're gonna get some more calls in here.
[01:54:10.804 --> 01:54:12.605]  Let's talk to Sue in Missouri.
[01:54:12.625 --> 01:54:13.705]  We should have gone to calls earlier.
[01:54:13.745 --> 01:54:14.725]  This is crazy.
[01:54:14.785 --> 01:54:16.646]  Sue, you got a comment on the thing.
[01:54:16.666 --> 01:54:19.847]  Now listen, you're in Missouri and we've got KCXL and a few other affiliates there.
[01:54:20.147 --> 01:54:23.387]  You're gonna be arrested right now if you talk bad about him, but what's on your mind?
[01:54:23.748 --> 01:54:25.648]  No, I live for you.
[01:54:25.668 --> 01:54:29.109]  I listen to you and you listen.
[01:54:29.209 --> 01:54:30.009]  I'm a neutral person.
[01:54:30.449 --> 01:54:32.631]  I have been an apolitical person all my life.
[01:54:32.651 --> 01:54:33.651]  I have a lot of education.
[01:54:34.392 --> 01:54:38.855]  I am phenomenally concerned for pretty much everybody at this point.
[01:54:39.035 --> 01:54:44.358]  And I don't draw lines, I don't make statements, but free speech is beating in the end of it all.
[01:54:44.398 --> 01:54:47.400]  If that dies, you know, what else dies?
[01:54:47.420 --> 01:54:51.222]  Well, you're in Missouri and it's also happening in Illinois where police are going out.
[01:54:51.282 --> 01:54:54.605]  If they say you lied about Obama, they decide, then they arrest you.
[01:54:54.625 --> 01:54:55.545]  Do you have comments on that?
[01:54:57.086 --> 01:54:58.107]  I would be horrified.
[01:54:59.693 --> 01:55:06.058]  Well, then you should please look at this Vermont case, because that's exactly... this guy was really arrested and thrown in jail for 36 hours.
[01:55:06.098 --> 01:55:07.359]  But that's my point!
[01:55:07.900 --> 01:55:10.161]  Trooper calls up, I know this guy!
[01:55:10.181 --> 01:55:15.606]  You know, I don't know him well, but I know he's an Austin fixture, and he's saying he believes in it!
[01:55:16.186 --> 01:55:20.550]  That they really... this is like... this is like Night of the Living Braindead!
[01:55:21.751 --> 01:55:24.112]  I mean, I'm not trying to be mean to people here, but come on!
[01:55:25.013 --> 01:55:25.694]  Like zombies!
[01:55:28.425 --> 01:55:29.266]  Anything else, Sue?
[01:55:29.626 --> 01:55:30.547]  God Almighty.
[01:55:31.307 --> 01:55:37.711]  I'm just horrified and I'm concerned and I'm completely neutral and apolitical prior to any of, you know, these things.
[01:55:38.112 --> 01:55:38.752]  No, I hear you.
[01:55:38.872 --> 01:55:41.894]  And listen, when I first heard this and saw this Friday, I thought it was a stunt.
[01:55:42.234 --> 01:55:43.956]  I made a bunch of phone calls yesterday and today.
[01:55:45.256 --> 01:55:46.097]  Friday and Saturday.
[01:55:47.198 --> 01:55:48.038]  And it's true.
[01:55:48.058 --> 01:55:52.741]  They get on the phone with you and say, yeah, do you know anybody that's talking bad about him?
[01:55:52.761 --> 01:55:53.522]  We want to get him.
[01:55:53.542 --> 01:55:54.483]  You just heard.
[01:55:55.603 --> 01:55:58.764]  Webster, I think you're really on to something here, and probably too late.
[01:55:58.784 --> 01:55:59.604]  It's probably all over.
[01:55:59.624 --> 01:56:03.266]  He'll probably put us all... Alex, here's what I believe.
[01:56:03.406 --> 01:56:07.467]  I think the American people are still anti-fascist, to the core.
[01:56:07.887 --> 01:56:09.948]  This is an anti-fascist country.
[01:56:10.686 --> 01:56:16.408]  We've never had fascism, and I urge people, if you don't want to have fascism now, mobilize.
[01:56:16.428 --> 01:56:17.029]  Let's go to Joe.
[01:56:17.049 --> 01:56:18.389]  Let's go to Joe in California.
[01:56:18.409 --> 01:56:19.090]  Joe, you're on the air.
[01:56:19.110 --> 01:56:21.671]  Webster Tarbley, who... Hey, Webster.
[01:56:21.711 --> 01:56:22.611]  Hey, Alex.
[01:56:22.731 --> 01:56:29.354]  Listen, Trooper and people that think like him, they should go back to Civics 101 and read the Bill of Rights.
[01:56:29.834 --> 01:56:30.675]  It's disgusting.
[01:56:30.715 --> 01:56:31.655]  It's pathetic.
[01:56:32.315 --> 01:56:33.256]  What about the cops?
[01:56:33.356 --> 01:56:35.837]  They're out arresting people that talk about Obama!
[01:56:36.617 --> 01:56:37.358]  Absolutely, Ryan.
[01:56:37.378 --> 01:56:38.258]  I'll tell you another thing.
[01:56:38.678 --> 01:56:52.805]  Kudos to Mr. Tarpley, and hopefully Alex, you can bring on Larry Sinclair and the preacher that's had their videos on YouTube with respect to his lying about drug use, since he says he hasn't used drugs since he was in college.
[01:56:53.445 --> 01:56:55.466]  And in fact, he did it in 2000, I believe it was 2001, with Sinclair.
[01:56:59.768 --> 01:57:06.832]  1999.
[01:56:59.929 --> 01:57:06.832]  That would be Reverend James David Manning, one of the biggest black churches in Harlem and New York City, and I strongly recommend him.
[01:57:07.052 --> 01:57:08.293]  Well look, we're out of time.
[01:57:08.333 --> 01:57:24.242]  Go to InfoWars.com, get Tarpley's books, InfoWars.com, go read the article, and you can go read stories with his quotes and videos of him saying ban most types of rifles, and you know the bottom line is I've stayed out of this, but anytime somebody comes on air
[01:57:25.046 --> 01:57:32.011]  And anytime somebody calls the police, and anytime cops come on TV and say, we're going to arrest you for your speech, well, guess what?
[01:57:32.391 --> 01:57:39.297]  A John McCain sticker is about to go on my car right now, unless Barack Obama comes out and denounces all of this.
[01:57:39.737 --> 01:57:42.519]  I have stayed out of this, but I am not putting up with this.
[01:57:42.779 --> 01:57:44.700]  And I'm not going to put up with you Obama zombies either.
[01:57:45.121 --> 01:57:46.402]  Webster, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:57:46.422 --> 01:57:48.063]  Thank you, Alex, and congratulations.
[01:57:48.103 --> 01:57:49.664]  You performed an important public service.
[01:57:49.684 --> 01:57:50.064]  Thank you.
[01:57:50.084 --> 01:57:50.725]  We're out of time!

[01:58:35.467 --> 01:58:39.189]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.

[01:58:56.880 --> 01:59:04.668]  Nature's Renewal Supreme Joint Formula provides glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate to regenerate healthy cartilage.
[01:59:04.848 --> 01:59:10.574]  Hyaluronic acid, a vital component for your soft connective tissue and natural body lubricants of your joints,
