[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.050]  We're good to go.
[00:00:31.348 --> 00:00:39.917]  We only have one guest today because I want to have plenty of time to cover the news and have open phones in the first, third, and fourth hour today.
[00:00:39.917 --> 00:00:52.249]  Pastor David J. Smith from Waxahachie, Texas, fighting the New World Order for more than 30 years, will be joining us on air to talk about his neck of the woods nearby the Baptist
[00:00:53.257 --> 00:01:06.925]  Bible School in East Texas where they have Homeland Security come in and tell members of the staff that they'll be arrested and charged with espionage if they speak about the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:01:08.362 --> 00:01:11.124]  Now, of course, we have video of FEMA training police.
[00:01:11.124 --> 00:01:23.911]  We have their training manuals, FBI training manuals, flyers, squad car video of them pulling a woman over and finding a pocket constitution, and the police have a discussion and say it's illegal, arrest is made, can't have a constitution.
[00:01:23.911 --> 00:01:26.792]  If you're a new listener, this is not a joke, okay?
[00:01:26.792 --> 00:01:28.193]  I'm not joking.
[00:01:28.193 --> 00:01:29.413]  This is really going on.
[00:01:29.413 --> 00:01:32.915]  This is how serious things are.
[00:01:32.915 --> 00:01:36.057]  So, he'll be joining us coming up.
[00:01:37.732 --> 00:01:43.794]  As I told you, I plan to have all the real icons, the people who've been fighting for decades and decades against the New World Order, on this show.
[00:01:43.794 --> 00:01:46.935]  They've all been on before, but many of them haven't been on in years.
[00:01:46.935 --> 00:01:51.216]  In fact, I just remembered again to try to get Red Beckman on, if his health allows.
[00:01:51.216 --> 00:01:54.657]  I haven't had him on in a few years, and he's a World War II vet.
[00:01:54.657 --> 00:01:59.398]  He really is one of the great granddaddies of them all.
[00:01:59.398 --> 00:01:59.558]  Now,
[00:02:01.215 --> 00:02:04.016]  Big show today, a lot of news, a lot of information.
[00:02:04.016 --> 00:02:25.399]  We'll cover a bunch of it after this first break, but before I do that on this 14th of May 2008 edition, I was listening to Derry Brownfield as I was driving into work this morning and then here in the office on local radio station 90.1, and I was, not 90.1, he's on 96.3, excuse me, I was listening to Derry Brownfield and
[00:02:32.426 --> 00:02:33.686]  Just the things he was saying.
[00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:37.348]  I already knew everything he was saying, but it hit me anew.
[00:02:37.348 --> 00:02:45.111]  I had fresh outrage because I was aware of the information he was covering, and then even more.
[00:02:45.111 --> 00:02:47.792]  I'm not, don't misinterpret, I'm not saying I know more than he does.
[00:02:47.792 --> 00:02:48.572]  It's not about that.
[00:02:48.572 --> 00:02:52.633]  I mean, there's so much data, and obviously he has more data too.
[00:02:52.633 --> 00:02:56.295]  It's so bad that you can't even explain it to people.
[00:02:56.295 --> 00:02:57.175]  You can't even
[00:02:58.161 --> 00:03:00.503]  Put forward how truly bad it is.
[00:03:00.503 --> 00:03:03.425]  We're going to invite Derry on the show here in the next week or two.
[00:03:03.425 --> 00:03:08.288]  I hope he can join us, because it's multifaceted.
[00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:11.790]  Derry Brownfield criticized Monsanto.
[00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:22.678]  He is on, of his 70 or so affiliates, most of them are in Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Iowa, right there in the breadbasket of the country.
[00:03:23.513 --> 00:03:49.559]  He's been on the air doing farm reports for, I don't know, 30, 40 years, but he's had a syndicated radio show since the 80s, fighting the New World Order, and they told him at Learfield Communications, he previously owned a part of Learfield when he founded it back in the 60s, he sold out to Learfield in the late 80s, he said, they told him, they said, Monsanto has said, shut up and don't talk about him.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:58.546]  And they're one of our big sponsors, not just with Brownfield, but the entire Learfield, a bunch of other shows, farm reports, news reports.
[00:03:58.546 --> 00:04:01.188]  And so Dairy has had to leave Learfield.
[00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:08.694]  And he is leaving at the end of the month, and he's going to come to Genesis, come to the GCN Radio Network that always has carried his show.
[00:04:08.694 --> 00:04:17.480]  I don't know, for like 10 years, we've put it out on some of the satellite feeds we've got, and he comes on right before me on the network feed, on the internet, AM and FM, shortwave, the rest of it.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.162]  But now he's going to be produced by Genesis.
[00:04:20.162 --> 00:04:24.925]  We're very, very excited about that, and we ask, of course, that all his affiliates continue carrying him.
[00:04:24.925 --> 00:04:26.026]  We know that many
[00:04:28.388 --> 00:04:28.788]  It is a big idea
[00:04:56.471 --> 00:04:58.233]  A New World Order.
[00:04:58.233 --> 00:05:03.117]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:05:03.117 --> 00:05:05.980]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.763]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:05:08.763 --> 00:05:11.946]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:11.946 --> 00:05:19.273]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:22.284 --> 00:05:27.728]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:27.728 --> 00:05:31.610]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.172]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:34.172 --> 00:05:35.333]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:35.333 --> 00:05:36.113]  They're not after money.
[00:05:36.113 --> 00:05:37.394]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:37.394 --> 00:05:38.375]  They're after power.
[00:05:38.375 --> 00:05:39.536]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[00:05:39.536 --> 00:05:48.241]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:48.241 --> 00:05:51.063]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:05:51.063 --> 00:05:52.124]  You have been warned.
[00:05:53.425 --> 00:05:56.946]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:05:56.946 --> 00:06:02.349]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:07.511]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:06:07.511 --> 00:06:18.616]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:06:19.036 --> 00:06:24.800]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:31.065]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[00:06:31.065 --> 00:06:32.105]  What about you?
[00:06:32.105 --> 00:06:34.107]  Order your KDF shower filter normally.

[00:06:52.694 --> 00:06:55.215]  Hi, this is Dave from Ready Reserve Foods.
[00:06:55.215 --> 00:07:02.577]  I have been waiting patiently for the government and mainstream media to inform you of what is turning out to be the biggest problem facing the world in the last 50 years.
[00:07:02.577 --> 00:07:08.159]  For the last three years, the Earth has consumed more food than it has been able to produce, and it has now finally caught up with this.
[00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:15.101]  In the U.S., commodities such as flour and rice are already being rationed, and the next rice crop won't be available for another four to five months.
[00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:21.703]  It's fall in the Southern Hemisphere, and many countries are short the food necessary to make it through the winter and have stopped exporting certain commodities altogether.
[00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:24.089]  Remember our trade deficit?
[00:07:24.089 --> 00:07:29.951]  Trillions of dollars have stacked up outside the country and are now rushing in to buy our food production at any price.
[00:07:29.951 --> 00:07:36.332]  By late summer, if not early fall, it is likely our government will step in and control food and food exports under martial law.
[00:07:36.332 --> 00:07:37.812]  Call Ready Reserve Foods at 1-800-453-2202.
[00:07:37.812 --> 00:07:37.892]  1-800-453-2202.

[00:07:53.427 --> 00:07:58.840]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.126]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:12.177 --> 00:08:25.846]  Every major airport in the United States is getting body scanners where they put you into a chamber that 360 scans your entire biometric layout of your body and gives them a full color image of your naked body in 3D.
[00:08:27.453 --> 00:08:37.618]  Of course, first they put it in five airports, then 20 airports, then 50 airports, and now 200 plus all the major airports being announced by the Associated Press.
[00:08:37.618 --> 00:08:51.424]  And just like one out of ten or so gets to wand it over and they then search you and then a percentage of those people get strip searched, now you will be directed into the scanner and your naked body will be stored on hard drives.
[00:08:51.424 --> 00:08:55.266]  All about humiliation, all about setting precedence, all about control.
[00:08:57.014 --> 00:09:01.218]  Also, we told you at least seven years ago that we saw this in government.
[00:09:01.218 --> 00:09:05.101]  Pentagon, MIT, Toyota.
[00:09:05.101 --> 00:09:10.586]  Governmental reports they submitted to the Japanese government.
[00:09:10.586 --> 00:09:13.268]  Everyone will be face scanned, buy and sell.
[00:09:13.268 --> 00:09:14.970]  And I told you they would phase this in.
[00:09:16.051 --> 00:09:24.078]  Quote to stop cigarette smoking and drinking because that was in the corporate and governmental Playbooks they they have governmental meetings.
[00:09:24.078 --> 00:09:40.591]  It's it's in their minutes We've read them on air how they would phase this in it has now been reported by the AP and as well by British papers That in England and the US they are going to mandate that stores put in face scanners that scan your face and
[00:09:41.653 --> 00:09:46.201]  To quote, stop people underage drinking and getting alcohol and cigarettes.
[00:09:46.201 --> 00:09:50.048]  All guilty until proven innocent has nothing to do with stopping drinking and smoking.
[00:09:50.838 --> 00:10:01.363]  This will be the new global ID system, where not only will you have to swipe the card to buy and sell under a new global sales tax and new carbon tax, but you could have a stolen card.
[00:10:01.363 --> 00:10:02.543]  It could be fake.
[00:10:02.543 --> 00:10:04.544]  Big Brother has to know who you are.
[00:10:04.544 --> 00:10:06.065]  And then, of course, you won't be notified.
[00:10:06.065 --> 00:10:18.950]  Generally, the computer will allow you to still get the food, but a SWAT truck that will be deployed, positioned every few miles, will be in route at 80 miles an hour with a assault team to take you to the FEMA camp.
[00:10:19.542 --> 00:10:23.545]  Whether you'll be sent to forced labor or to automatic execution.
[00:10:23.545 --> 00:10:25.607]  By the way, I'm not saying that for effect.
[00:10:25.607 --> 00:10:28.670]  Notice everything I've said in the past is coming true, okay?
[00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:32.273]  It's happened, and I'm telling you what the next phase is.
[00:10:32.273 --> 00:10:36.236]  I understand their program, and nothing is too bold for them.
[00:10:36.236 --> 00:10:38.198]  Nothing is too incredible for them.
[00:10:38.198 --> 00:10:40.299]  Nothing is too amazing for them.
[00:10:40.299 --> 00:10:46.985]  This is the government that writes memos saying, we will sexually torture small children in front of their parents, and then they did it.
[00:10:47.754 --> 00:10:55.439]  This is the government that is handing over the entire infrastructure and putting up toll roads on existing roads and then saying it doesn't exist.
[00:10:55.439 --> 00:11:02.343]  This is the government that is completely lawless and totally controlled by scientific tyranny.
[00:11:02.343 --> 00:11:06.726]  This is the government that ladens your vaccines with mercury and cancer viruses.
[00:11:06.726 --> 00:11:07.727]  This is the government
[00:11:08.416 --> 00:11:10.637]  This is the government that comes to kill, steal, and destroy.
[00:11:10.637 --> 00:11:11.798]  Okay, I'm already digressing.
[00:11:11.798 --> 00:11:14.820]  I just can't believe this one article I've got here.
[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.421]  I knew they were going to do it.
[00:11:16.421 --> 00:11:18.502]  I knew they said they would do it.
[00:11:18.502 --> 00:11:19.323]  It's just they're doing.
[00:11:19.323 --> 00:11:27.367]  I want to be able to continue to fly, but when they... See, I'm not an ignorant sheep.
[00:11:27.367 --> 00:11:31.250]  Remember I told you about five years, six years, maybe longer,
[00:11:32.486 --> 00:11:41.548]  I know I read industry documents in 1998, and it didn't start until about 2004, so I guess I covered it ten years ago.
[00:11:41.548 --> 00:11:43.008]  See, time just flies.
[00:11:43.008 --> 00:11:57.550]  They were going to put thumb scanners in at SeaWorld, at Disney, and then at other parks, and then at tanning salons, and gyms, and churches, and public school cafeterias, and libraries, and to get into work.
[00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.531]  And then now Homeland Security has announced that's what they want nationwide.
[00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:08.305]  And it happened, not because I'm smart, because they said they would do it that way.
[00:12:08.305 --> 00:12:19.153]  And they, so I know, just like, people keep calling going, wow, I just went to Disney World, and it's like you said, they make you thumbprint to get in.
[00:12:19.153 --> 00:12:20.173]  Well, no, they don't make you.
[00:12:20.173 --> 00:12:23.035]  If you say no, they just say, yes, sir, go on through.
[00:12:23.035 --> 00:12:24.817]  But 90 plus percent do it.
[00:12:24.817 --> 00:12:26.258]  It's habitualization.
[00:12:26.258 --> 00:12:29.100]  Does the person at the turnstiles, are they an evil new order agent?
[00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:29.240]  No.
[00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:34.664]  Does the local even manager of the Disney World know what's going on?
[00:12:34.664 --> 00:12:35.845]  No, they're compartmentalized.
[00:12:35.845 --> 00:12:37.926]  It's all Defense Department.
[00:12:37.926 --> 00:12:39.288]  They are the infrastructure.
[00:12:39.288 --> 00:12:40.809]  They set up the zip code.
[00:12:40.809 --> 00:12:42.110]  They set up the GPS.
[00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:44.592]  They set up all the standards.
[00:12:44.592 --> 00:12:45.513]  They run it.
[00:12:45.513 --> 00:12:49.115]  Do you understand?
[00:12:49.115 --> 00:12:56.722]  Now, are they going to tell you when you're at the airport, when they say, please step over here, and they put you into the chamber?
[00:12:56.722 --> 00:12:59.724]  All major airports, 200 plus, that's every major airport,
[00:13:02.845 --> 00:13:04.366]  AP.
[00:13:04.366 --> 00:13:05.206]  Feds are paying for it.
[00:13:05.206 --> 00:13:08.888]  Of course, Lockheed and others make them.
[00:13:08.888 --> 00:13:10.248]  Another Defense Department op.
[00:13:10.248 --> 00:13:11.168]  Making money.
[00:13:11.168 --> 00:13:14.130]  The military system we paid for now turned in against us.
[00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:17.631]  And they get a biometric neckage scan.
[00:13:17.631 --> 00:13:21.953]  Now listen, you might as well tell your 20-year-old wife, honey, go be in Playboy.
[00:13:21.953 --> 00:13:22.873]  You might as well get a $50,000.
[00:13:24.801 --> 00:13:26.742]  And I'm not being serious.
[00:13:26.742 --> 00:13:28.703]  This is sarcasm, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:28.703 --> 00:13:32.665]  Please don't put me on all the Bible websites saying I'm advocating being in Playboy.
[00:13:32.665 --> 00:13:34.246]  It's a point.
[00:13:34.246 --> 00:13:41.990]  Seriously, though, you might as well go ahead and get $50,000, or whatever they pay to be in Playboy, or Penthouse, or go all the way.
[00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:47.913]  Get into hardcore porn, because a clear image of your naked body.
[00:13:47.913 --> 00:13:50.474]  Now, they already have the illegal alien goons, which has come out.
[00:13:50.474 --> 00:13:53.796]  That's who a lot of them are, poking and prodding and pulling the women's dresses up.
[00:13:54.369 --> 00:13:55.690]  And you say, the government's dumb.
[00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:56.450]  Why are they doing this?
[00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:58.511]  Why is the border open when this is happening to us?
[00:13:58.511 --> 00:14:04.954]  I saw a World War II vet on oxygen tanks being searched by these guys, but guys with turbines were walking right through.
[00:14:04.954 --> 00:14:06.255]  It doesn't make sense.
[00:14:06.255 --> 00:14:08.556]  It doesn't make sense to stop terrorists.
[00:14:08.556 --> 00:14:09.397]  But that's not what it's for.
[00:14:09.397 --> 00:14:14.739]  It's to train you to be a slave.
[00:14:14.739 --> 00:14:15.720]  So let me explain.
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:18.441]  Face scanners going in, and this is how it works.
[00:14:18.441 --> 00:14:23.284]  You'll first see Exxon Mobil, Tony the Tiger do it, because I've noticed they always implement their first.
[00:14:23.812 --> 00:14:26.154]  You'll see McDonald's and Walmart implement first.
[00:14:26.154 --> 00:14:29.057]  Key partners in rollout of SlaveGrid.
[00:14:29.057 --> 00:14:36.062]  Then the lobbyists run around and they offer to give it free to the companies, and they say, listen, this gives you total liability protection.
[00:14:36.062 --> 00:14:40.066]  Local detective comes in and says, do you want the local liquor commission coming in here?
[00:14:40.066 --> 00:14:43.849]  You know, this is what they tell the corporate guys at the lower level companies.
[00:14:43.849 --> 00:14:46.091]  The big ones are part of the inside deal.
[00:14:46.091 --> 00:14:49.394]  Many times own stock in the companies that are putting in the face scanners.
[00:14:49.394 --> 00:14:50.935]  But the low levels, they come in and they say, look,
[00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:53.652]  Look, we know you're training your people.
[00:14:53.652 --> 00:14:55.594]  That's why they card 75-year-old women.
[00:14:55.594 --> 00:14:56.255]  I've seen it.
[00:14:56.255 --> 00:14:58.577]  For buying cigars for their husband.
[00:14:58.577 --> 00:15:00.579]  It's to habitualize that it doesn't make sense.
[00:15:00.579 --> 00:15:02.381]  That it's crazy.
[00:15:02.381 --> 00:15:06.545]  That no matter how stupid the order is, you have to follow it.
[00:15:06.545 --> 00:15:06.886]  Okay?
[00:15:06.886 --> 00:15:12.131]  I mean, I've seen 70-year-old, 80-year-old people being carded for a bottle of wine.
[00:15:12.131 --> 00:15:13.793]  You know, at the gas station.
[00:15:13.793 --> 00:15:15.034]  I mean, I see it everywhere.
[00:15:15.831 --> 00:15:16.912]  And I just start talking.
[00:15:16.912 --> 00:15:21.834]  I go, ladies and gentlemen, when they swipe your card right there, that goes into a database.
[00:15:21.834 --> 00:15:25.935]  And the person behind the counter, I go, don't roll your eyes.
[00:15:25.935 --> 00:15:28.837]  Is that giving you an indicator that says it's authorized?
[00:15:28.837 --> 00:15:30.177]  And they'll go, yeah.
[00:15:30.177 --> 00:15:37.401]  Of course, a lot of times they're a fan behind the counter, and they take me behind the counter and go, yeah, they're watching me right now live over the cameras in here, but I don't care if they fire me.
[00:15:37.401 --> 00:15:38.141]  I'm sick of this job.
[00:15:38.141 --> 00:15:40.442]  Yeah, look, it says authorized.
[00:15:40.442 --> 00:15:42.503]  Well, see, there's a whole database on the other end of that.
[00:15:42.503 --> 00:15:43.663]  Everything being wired in.
[00:15:43.663 --> 00:15:45.224]  Everything Pentagon-designed.
[00:15:47.742 --> 00:15:49.323]  Do you understand the magnitude?
[00:15:49.323 --> 00:15:54.566]  See, I'm just getting into one story, then I run off down the rabbit trail into detailing it for you.
[00:15:54.566 --> 00:16:01.629]  Because if I just cover the story and read the headline, it doesn't give you the full spectrum understanding of what we're dealing with here.
[00:16:01.629 --> 00:16:09.654]  How creeping it is, how malevolent it is, how wicked, the premeditatedness of it.
[00:16:09.654 --> 00:16:16.097]  So, you're gonna walk through the scanners, and you're gonna go ahead and submit,
[00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:17.561]  Not me.
[00:16:17.561 --> 00:16:22.264]  I'm gonna say, you are not gonna have a body scan of me.
[00:16:22.264 --> 00:16:24.626]  Let's do a pat-down, you little turkey.
[00:16:24.626 --> 00:16:25.966]  And people can say, well, just don't fly.
[00:16:25.966 --> 00:16:27.748]  I have to fly to fight the New World Order.
[00:16:27.748 --> 00:16:32.411]  I gotta fly to London, or fly to Canada, or fly to LA, or fly to, you know, Nicaragua.
[00:16:32.411 --> 00:16:37.274]  I mean, I've gotta be able to go and cover these events and do these things.
[00:16:37.274 --> 00:16:44.860]  And so I've gotta go deal with little monkey-brained, dumbed-down, power-tripping nobodies who really think they're fighting Al-Syeda.
[00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:54.145]  I got a lot of people on their power trip prodding and poking and, you know, every second pressing on the nerve of power, ingratiating their psychology that they're really doing something good.
[00:16:54.145 --> 00:16:56.946]  Of course, some of them just need a job.
[00:16:56.946 --> 00:16:58.847]  I'm not saying they're all bad, but a lot of them enjoy it.
[00:16:58.847 --> 00:17:02.389]  I mean, I've had them make fun of me, pull me out of the line, prod me.
[00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:05.131]  It's just celebrations of evil and tyranny.
[00:17:05.131 --> 00:17:07.592]  Seen them do it to other people.
[00:17:07.592 --> 00:17:08.353]  It isn't that.
[00:17:08.353 --> 00:17:08.793]  It's that
[00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:23.051]  Then how do I let my wife and children ever fly when I know they'll be in the hands of paramilitary goons that are going to stick them in a chamber to take pornographic photos, full-body 360 scans to be stored in your database?
[00:17:23.051 --> 00:17:28.515]  Remember, I told you 12 years ago they're taking your DNA at birth and putting it in a global database.
[00:17:28.515 --> 00:17:34.760]  Now Bush has signed a bill to legalize retroactively what they've been doing!
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.442]  The government is criminal!
[00:17:36.442 --> 00:17:37.703]  It's rogue!
[00:17:37.703 --> 00:17:39.044]  It is a rogue government.
[00:17:40.401 --> 00:17:41.782]  There's a website called Rogue Government.
[00:17:41.782 --> 00:17:44.585]  I was thinking last night what a good name that is.
[00:17:44.585 --> 00:17:47.087]  It is, it's just Rogue, Rogue Government.
[00:17:47.087 --> 00:17:53.173]  Smart criminals that use scientific engineers to set up the grid using behavioral psychology.
[00:17:55.296 --> 00:17:57.538]  And I'm sitting here watching Nightfall happen.
[00:17:57.538 --> 00:17:59.679]  I'm sitting here watching tyranny come down.
[00:17:59.679 --> 00:18:02.021]  I'm sitting here watching the grid go into place.
[00:18:02.021 --> 00:18:11.589]  I'm just desperately trying to get on more on AM and FM's and trying to get you to tell people how to tune into the show or to the internet streams of the podcast because I want to stop these people.
[00:18:11.589 --> 00:18:16.733]  I know it's horrible because once the grid's in place, they're going to release the bioweapons.
[00:18:16.733 --> 00:18:19.715]  Do you understand police, military, FBI, all of you?
[00:18:20.155 --> 00:18:29.602]  You're not going to believe me now, but years from now, maybe a decade, maybe 20 years, maybe next month, when they think their grid is in place, that's when they're going to release the plagues.
[00:18:29.602 --> 00:18:31.923]  And the shots they're going to give you aren't going to protect you.
[00:18:31.923 --> 00:18:34.865]  They want to wipe out masses of people.
[00:18:34.865 --> 00:18:35.946]  Billions of people.
[00:18:35.946 --> 00:18:37.707]  They constantly talk about it.
[00:18:38.539 --> 00:18:49.741]  Go to any big biology awards ceremony, I guarantee you, you'll be in a room with thousands of people with 160 IQs, talking about how they want to kill everybody, and they work in the bioweapons labs!
[00:18:49.741 --> 00:18:53.322]  You want to do real investigations?
[00:18:53.322 --> 00:18:54.042]  I can't believe it.
[00:18:54.042 --> 00:18:55.322]  I just can't believe it.
[00:18:55.322 --> 00:18:56.003]  And it's going to happen.
[00:18:56.003 --> 00:18:57.743]  You're not going to listen.
[00:18:57.743 --> 00:18:58.483]  You won't.
[00:18:58.483 --> 00:18:59.943]  You're on a personal power trip.
[00:18:59.943 --> 00:19:03.284]  It's too important to you to live the delusion you're in.
[00:19:04.102 --> 00:19:05.863]  And to think that I'm the crazy one.
[00:19:05.863 --> 00:19:09.125]  I told you they'd face scan you to buy and sell.
[00:19:09.125 --> 00:19:14.848]  I told you they would implement it under the guise of stopping underage drinking.
[00:19:14.848 --> 00:19:20.771]  Scanning out of photos out of the driver's license national ID card database.
[00:19:20.771 --> 00:19:24.233]  God help us, it's in the mainstream news.
[00:19:24.233 --> 00:19:28.795]  They're not talking about it, they're putting it in.
[00:19:28.795 --> 00:19:30.716]  Do you realize, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:19:31.457 --> 00:19:37.180]  That the minute their grid's in place, beta-tested, they are gonna start the killin'.
[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:42.283]  Now, in the lead-up to the lockdown grid, they're gonna have controlled, smaller bioreleases.
[00:19:42.283 --> 00:19:45.545]  Each one bigger, like SARS, like bird flu.
[00:19:45.545 --> 00:19:50.428]  We're facin' hell on Earth, ladies and gentlemen, and in your gut, you know I'm tellin' the truth.
[00:19:50.428 --> 00:19:52.769]  But you don't have to believe your gut, go check out the facts.
[00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:57.492]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:19:57.492 --> 00:20:06.960]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:14.046]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:14.767 --> 00:20:20.755]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:20.755 --> 00:20:31.549]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:32.650]  I think so.
[00:20:53.726 --> 00:21:06.857]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:21:06.857 --> 00:21:17.925]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:21:17.925 --> 00:21:20.167]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:21:21.328 --> 00:21:23.089]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[00:21:23.089 --> 00:21:29.212]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:21:55.248 --> 00:21:59.771]  Another untold story, here it comes.
[00:21:59.771 --> 00:22:04.334]  Another untold story, here it comes.
[00:22:04.334 --> 00:22:11.739]  Another untold story that you've not been told from AnotherUntoldStory.com
[00:22:14.056 --> 00:22:22.761]  Here's another untold story that most do not know, which has to do with that famous finger gesture called flipping the bird.
[00:22:22.761 --> 00:22:28.324]  That gesture, that story, has to do with that phrase, pluck you.
[00:22:28.324 --> 00:22:36.988]  No, no, we said that phrase, pluck, P-L-U-C-K, you, which, by the way, comes from the phrase, plucking, the you.
[00:22:36.988 --> 00:22:39.090]  And it all comes from history.
[00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:42.191]  History pertaining to the Battle of Argonne Court in 1415.
[00:22:43.852 --> 00:22:53.078]  It was a fierce battle between the French and the English, which the French felt sure to win, and so made a boast of what they were going to do to the English once they did.
[00:22:54.056 --> 00:23:07.487]  They boasted for naught for the battle they lost, and as a result of the boast and the loss, the victors before and after the battle came up with the famous salute we today call flipping the bird.
[00:23:07.487 --> 00:23:10.289]  And it has to do with plucking the yew.
[00:23:10.289 --> 00:23:14.293]  It was all once understood, but is now unknown and untold.
[00:23:14.913 --> 00:23:18.735]  We do tell it, however, at AnotherUntoldStory.com.
[00:23:18.735 --> 00:23:22.417]  Go there and hear it at AnotherUntoldStory.com.
[00:23:22.417 --> 00:23:25.519]  That's AnotherUntoldStory.com.
[00:23:25.519 --> 00:23:29.341]  Go there now, for it's only posted there, but for a short period of time.
[00:23:29.341 --> 00:23:31.702]  AnotherUntoldStory.com.
[00:23:31.702 --> 00:23:33.903]  It's quite a story.
[00:23:33.903 --> 00:23:38.946]  For another untold story, go to AnotherUntoldStory.com.
[00:23:38.946 --> 00:23:41.087]  AnotherUntoldStory.com.

[00:23:47.002 --> 00:23:50.845]  Another Untold Story dot com.
[00:23:50.845 --> 00:24:06.058]  I was sitting in traffic, listening to the radio.
[00:24:09.398 --> 00:24:29.987]  I've got three news articles today without looking with powerful globalist royalty university heads saying they want to reduce world population by 80 percent, have one child policies in the U.S., deny health care to the old, carry out eugenics.
[00:24:31.201 --> 00:24:32.742]  You understand police?
[00:24:32.742 --> 00:24:45.933]  You can go to the Texas Academy of Sciences when they gave Dr. Bianca the Lifetime Achievement Award, one of the top scientists at UT, and Dr. Bianca gave a speech about how he can't wait till 90% of us die.
[00:24:45.933 --> 00:24:51.818]  There's a big group that got international attention yesterday calling for all humans to die.
[00:24:51.818 --> 00:24:52.778]  Okay, do you understand?
[00:24:52.778 --> 00:24:54.180]  Get it through your head.
[00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:55.240]  You're not powerful.
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:56.782]  You're not in control.
[00:24:56.782 --> 00:24:58.823]  You're not as tough as you think you are.
[00:24:58.823 --> 00:25:00.585]  The world isn't the way you think it is.
[00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:02.611]  I'm already digressing.
[00:25:02.611 --> 00:25:06.354]  I just wish you would listen to me.
[00:25:06.354 --> 00:25:09.756]  I wish you would understand how serious things are.
[00:25:09.756 --> 00:25:11.558]  How deep things are.
[00:25:11.558 --> 00:25:14.200]  How far gone things are.
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:14.740]  Look at this.
[00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:17.462]  Eco Group calls for voluntary human extinction.
[00:25:17.462 --> 00:25:20.664]  Says masses should be indoctrinated to stop having children in order.
[00:25:20.664 --> 00:25:24.007]  That the human race can die out and save the planet.
[00:25:24.007 --> 00:25:26.589]  This is being reported by the Times of London and others.
[00:25:26.589 --> 00:25:28.971]  And then it gets into the... It's just so sick.
[00:25:28.971 --> 00:25:30.412]  I want to teach school children this.
[00:25:31.224 --> 00:25:35.266]  By the way, as you know, for 50 years it's already been taught to school children.
[00:25:35.266 --> 00:25:40.730]  I can get into that whole program I have with John Taylor Gatto and others, but I'm already digressing.
[00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:44.232]  I haven't even gotten to the stack of news and I said I would do it.
[00:25:44.232 --> 00:25:45.953]  We're going to do it in the next segment.
[00:25:45.953 --> 00:25:50.415]  Just getting back to Derry Brownfield, coming to the network starting next month, and he's already on the network.
[00:25:50.415 --> 00:25:54.938]  We're one of his satellite affiliates.
[00:25:54.938 --> 00:25:59.501]  Excited about that, but I heard him talking, and he was reading newspaper articles and reading out of a book.
[00:26:02.856 --> 00:26:09.240]  I've read large excerpts of years ago when it first came out, and I've experienced this personally.
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:09.821]  Let me explain.
[00:26:09.821 --> 00:26:11.182]  This is just one facet.
[00:26:11.182 --> 00:26:26.092]  This is somewhere you can document it right now for yourself, or most of you remember this happening in your town or city, and this is just something that isn't as shocking or scary sounding as, hey, the people running the global government are eugenicists and want to kill you.
[00:26:28.208 --> 00:26:29.889]  They even made James Bond movies about it.
[00:26:29.889 --> 00:26:31.690]  You know, they put reality into fiction.
[00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:32.850]  Remember Moonraker?
[00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:39.013]  They want to kill everybody on the Earth while they sit on the space station and they're going to come back and people the Earth with Superman.
[00:26:39.013 --> 00:26:45.076]  Well, they actually have government documents and ideas and plans to do that, but do it underground and then re-emerge.
[00:26:46.658 --> 00:26:57.826]  You know, just like the last James Bond movie was about government-sponsored terror, or institutionalized sponsored terror, and the one before that was about DNA, individual bioweapons, and DNA harvesting, and life extension technologies.
[00:26:57.826 --> 00:26:59.387]  But I'm already digressing.
[00:26:59.387 --> 00:27:03.390]  The point here is that there's a whole reality around you you're not aware of.
[00:27:05.127 --> 00:27:13.930]  And that life is not the McDonald's signs and the Walmart signs and people, you know, in fancy dresses and riding around on Harleys.
[00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:15.190]  And I'm not saying any of that's bad.
[00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:18.332]  I'm saying that's all just a facade.
[00:27:18.332 --> 00:27:29.375]  Okay, we are these creatures, these homo sapiens sapiens that have babies and live and we live on a beautiful planet with trees and water and I don't know what type of birds they are.
[00:27:29.375 --> 00:27:31.336]  They're living right outside my front door
[00:27:32.205 --> 00:27:35.348]  They've got red chest and blue bodies and they're little babies.
[00:27:35.348 --> 00:27:37.349]  I can watch them, their mommy feeding them.
[00:27:37.349 --> 00:27:38.250]  I mean, it's magic!
[00:27:39.051 --> 00:27:59.525]  And there's this whole cosmos around us, and we're going around this sun, and there's... I mean, last night I was watching footage from our new film, uh, just of the, uh, New York, uh, East River, and it's sunset, and I was looking at the beautiful waves, you know, that the high-def camera caught, and I was just stricken by the beauty, and I was like, my God, it's a paradox.
[00:27:59.525 --> 00:28:02.988]  There's all this beauty, all this incredible creation around us,
[00:28:03.875 --> 00:28:16.626]  All of God's handiwork, our beautiful families, our wonderful children, our wonderful elders, family histories, our pets, our artwork, our lives, our memories.
[00:28:16.626 --> 00:28:17.867]  It's all so wonderful!
[00:28:17.867 --> 00:28:19.848]  My life is wonderful!
[00:28:19.848 --> 00:28:26.514]  But then overhanging it is this growing global evil, and all the corruption, and all the things they do, and all their handiwork.
[00:28:26.514 --> 00:28:27.835]  I mean, it's all bad!
[00:28:29.961 --> 00:28:33.922]  And you know, while your life's going good, the CPS is snatching the kid down the street.
[00:28:33.922 --> 00:28:39.563]  Or while your life's good, the kid down the street just got on government-shipped-in cocaine.
[00:28:39.563 --> 00:28:44.164]  Or the kid down the street just got busted using government-shipped-in cocaine.
[00:28:44.164 --> 00:28:51.026]  Or the kid down the street was late to class three times in Austin, so they were arrested under truancy charges.
[00:28:51.026 --> 00:28:57.587]  Or the airport down the street's putting in a 360 body scanner to scan your body and put you in a government database.
[00:28:58.948 --> 00:29:13.174]  Or right down the street at the hospital, they're taking your baby's blood and putting it in a Homeland Security crime database, and digitizing it, and doing medical experiments with it, and admitting it all!
[00:29:13.174 --> 00:29:15.936]  It's totally criminal.
[00:29:15.936 --> 00:29:17.256]  We have to protect the good.
[00:29:17.256 --> 00:29:19.437]  When I get back, I'll tell you about what Brownfield was talking about today with the water.
[00:29:19.437 --> 00:29:21.478]  This will bring it home to you.
[00:29:22.333 --> 00:29:23.674]  It's even worse than what he was saying.
[00:29:23.674 --> 00:29:24.554]  It's always worse.
[00:29:24.554 --> 00:29:30.057]  In fact, it's so bad that if I studied for a year on this one subject and tried to bring you all the evidence, I couldn't do it.
[00:29:30.057 --> 00:29:35.120]  I mean, what we know is so horrible, it can't even be articulated.
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:36.741]  Imagine what else is going on.
[00:29:36.741 --> 00:29:38.482]  Not just the poison in the water.
[00:29:38.482 --> 00:29:44.205]  This is a separate subject.
[00:29:44.205 --> 00:29:45.586]  We're on the march.
[00:29:45.586 --> 00:29:48.127]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:48.127 --> 00:29:50.808]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:56.926 --> 00:29:59.288]  We're already under a scientific dictatorship.
[00:29:59.288 --> 00:30:02.790]  Martial Law is coming, but it's not going to arrive overnight.
[00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:04.771]  It's going to be incremental.
[00:30:04.771 --> 00:30:06.752]  This country is already teetering on the edge.
[00:30:06.752 --> 00:30:09.834]  Any incident, small or large, could trigger a total takeover.
[00:30:09.834 --> 00:30:11.315]  Anything could be the final push.

[00:30:54.236 --> 00:30:55.656]  It is a big idea.
[00:30:55.656 --> 00:30:58.457]  A New World Order.
[00:30:58.457 --> 00:31:03.338]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:31:03.338 --> 00:31:06.179]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:31:06.179 --> 00:31:08.979]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:31:08.979 --> 00:31:12.160]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:19.482]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:31:22.519 --> 00:31:27.962]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:31:27.962 --> 00:31:31.844]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:31:31.844 --> 00:31:34.385]  Dillberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:31:34.385 --> 00:31:35.546]  Most people have no idea.
[00:31:35.546 --> 00:31:36.347]  They're not after money.
[00:31:36.347 --> 00:31:37.607]  They have all the money they need.
[00:31:37.607 --> 00:31:38.608]  They're after power.
[00:31:38.608 --> 00:31:39.748]  That's what they're after.

[00:31:53.076 --> 00:31:58.439]  The Federal Trade Commission estimates that 9 million Americans are victims of identity theft each year.
[00:31:58.439 --> 00:32:04.463]  The crime of identity theft occurs every 3.5 seconds, costing the victims an average of $8,000.
[00:32:04.463 --> 00:32:11.287]  If you own a PC, passwords are a common form of authentication, and often the only protection between a hacker and your personal information.
[00:32:11.607 --> 00:32:20.609]  Passwords that are stored in a spreadsheet, text file, data file, or any other file that is not encrypted and password protected are vulnerable to malicious theft and misuse.

[00:33:10.447 --> 00:33:15.631]  Steve Ellison, Dave, Mike, Andrew, your calls are coming up after I cover some of the news headlines here.
[00:33:15.631 --> 00:33:34.464]  But I was listening to Jerry Brownfield this morning, read different news articles from locally in his town, cover other stories around the country, where they would just calmly come out, say in a California town, or one case, your bill's 240 bucks a month for water, which by the way is exorbitant.
[00:33:36.131 --> 00:33:48.476]  And, uh, the new company comes in out of Germany, but they have a subsidiary called, uh, California Water Systems, California American Water Systems, and they come in and they say, uh, it's now, uh, $1,270.
[00:33:48.476 --> 00:33:52.538]  And if you don't pay it, they just turn your water off.
[00:33:52.538 --> 00:34:02.722]  It's total highway robbery, and the federal government is mandating with regulations that local governments accept the takeover by these groups.
[00:34:02.722 --> 00:34:03.782]  Let me give you another example.
[00:34:04.631 --> 00:34:20.519]  I remember living in Austin, and about nine years ago, they picked your trash up twice a day, and then suddenly a new company, one that had been on 60 Minutes and other places for being mafia-owned and run, came in and took it over.
[00:34:20.519 --> 00:34:29.244]  And it tripled in price, and they started coming once a week, and they would look in your garbage, and there was like a board or something in there, they would call that
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:36.101]  They would call that construction waste and would leave all your trash there.
[00:34:36.101 --> 00:34:40.343]  And so, they've increased it since then.
[00:34:40.343 --> 00:34:42.243]  So that's how privatization works.
[00:34:42.243 --> 00:34:51.065]  That just means a private group came in and bought off your mayor, whose wife will then publicly get a consultant job for the company for 200, 300, 400 grand a year, doing nothing.
[00:34:55.609 --> 00:34:57.790]  I mean, it's slick, folks.
[00:34:57.790 --> 00:34:59.551]  That's how they operate.
[00:34:59.551 --> 00:35:02.112]  And it is, uh, it's the same in everything.
[00:35:02.112 --> 00:35:07.415]  It's the same with school, it's the same with taxes, it's the same with everything they do.
[00:35:07.415 --> 00:35:12.637]  And the bridges are collapsing and the roads are falling apart, but they're still slapping new toll roads on them.
[00:35:12.637 --> 00:35:17.140]  And they've got cops out riding tickets, and they tell the cops, oh, we're bankrupt, we've got to ride more tickets.
[00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:21.922]  And the cops hear how the bridges are collapsing, and the more tickets they ride, the less money goes to bridges.
[00:35:23.255 --> 00:35:50.992]  uh... right here in texas the feds took seven billion dollars out of the federal fund for texas the texas paid into it and just sent it to iraq last year alone and that's every state that's how it works and and and and then they tell the cops uh... you're gonna have a pay cut unless you write more tickets and so they go out and write tickets and of course it doesn't go to them and it's just it's totally and completely sick and
[00:35:53.095 --> 00:35:54.175]  That's how they're doing it.
[00:35:54.175 --> 00:36:08.440]  And you can read the IMF World Bank, you can read the Club of Rome documents, you can read all their statements going back 30 years ago where they said, we're going to go in, we're going to lobby, we're going to take over the water supplies, and then we're going to jack up prices.
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:09.680]  Just hundreds of documents.
[00:36:10.666 --> 00:36:19.933]  And in the IMF World Bank documents that were leaked in 2002, I talked so much about, because I went and read thousands of pages of them, that's why I'm... It's just an entire blueprint right there.
[00:36:19.933 --> 00:36:30.400]  They said, in fact, we'll go into countries and completely turn the water off once we own it, because then they'll really panic and riot, and then they'll accept anything afterwards.
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:36.404]  It's all psychology, it's all raping you, it's all squeezing you, it's all driving you into submission.
[00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:47.732]  Now, these same foreign companies that come in and buy up your water and then double the price, triple the price, quadruple the price, then each year after double the price.
[00:36:47.732 --> 00:36:49.032]  Let me give you a little news flash.
[00:36:49.032 --> 00:36:54.853]  The entire state of Texas has two large aquifers that cover the entire state.
[00:36:54.853 --> 00:36:58.254]  It is, in some cases, thousands of feet deep.
[00:36:58.254 --> 00:37:00.214]  Everywhere else, hundreds of feet deep.
[00:37:00.214 --> 00:37:02.495]  Pure water, totally clean, everywhere.
[00:37:02.495 --> 00:37:04.475]  Just giant aquifers, two big ones.
[00:37:05.487 --> 00:37:08.848]  And it's enough water to give the entire United States water forever.
[00:37:08.848 --> 00:37:10.288]  I mean, it's just unlimited.
[00:37:10.288 --> 00:37:11.949]  It's always being replenished.
[00:37:11.949 --> 00:37:12.469]  Doesn't matter.
[00:37:12.469 --> 00:37:14.830]  They run PR campaigns telling you there's no water.
[00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:16.490]  Gotta accept higher prices.
[00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:18.131]  It's your carbon footprint.
[00:37:18.131 --> 00:37:20.671]  Because of the Earth being in trouble, we have to pay more.
[00:37:20.671 --> 00:37:25.813]  And the public, they have huge PR campaigns that say you've got to pay more now because there's no water.
[00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:28.871]  And why shouldn't they?
[00:37:28.871 --> 00:37:42.084]  I mean, if they're going to be able to quadruple, plus all your water bills, they're just taking a few percentage points of that and not just buying the mayors and city councils and county commissioners and state legislators and the feds to mandate it all.
[00:37:42.836 --> 00:37:52.884]  Feds come in and say, you know what, we're not going to give you any of your water funding, though we take your money from the states and 33 cents back on average, unless you accept, unless it's a privatization.
[00:37:52.884 --> 00:37:59.429]  And they have a bunch of fake libertarians dance around and go, privatize, privatize, but it's not privatization.
[00:37:59.429 --> 00:38:02.832]  It's taking our water systems we paid for with tax money.
[00:38:02.832 --> 00:38:05.834]  See, first the Feds said, oh, you just got to put fluoride in it.
[00:38:05.834 --> 00:38:07.136]  Feds say.
[00:38:07.136 --> 00:38:08.156]  You got to put chlorine in it.
[00:38:08.156 --> 00:38:08.657]  Feds say.
[00:38:08.657 --> 00:38:10.798]  Doesn't matter if it's totally clean out of an aquifer.
[00:38:10.798 --> 00:38:11.359]  Feds say.
[00:38:12.099 --> 00:38:18.947]  And then now, Feds say you gotta let this German company, or Dutch company, or Chinese company, or Russian company, or British company.
[00:38:18.947 --> 00:38:20.969]  And every time you look, it's not U.S.
[00:38:20.969 --> 00:38:21.429]  companies.
[00:38:21.429 --> 00:38:22.571]  Those don't exist anymore.
[00:38:22.571 --> 00:38:23.932]  They're all globalists.
[00:38:23.932 --> 00:38:31.020]  And they just come in and they have the National Water Council, National Association of Governors, Association of City Managers.
[00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:35.591]  And they fly around and they're given public bribes.
[00:38:35.591 --> 00:38:39.991]  Supreme Court ruled two years ago that private companies can give bribes.
[00:38:39.991 --> 00:38:42.052]  It said now legal.
[00:38:42.052 --> 00:38:43.012]  Go read the ruling.
[00:38:43.012 --> 00:38:49.693]  Kelo versus Connecticut.
[00:38:49.693 --> 00:38:52.534]  The Kelo decision.
[00:38:52.534 --> 00:38:55.754]  And you can go in there and read it and it says legalize.
[00:38:55.754 --> 00:38:56.854]  It's piracy.
[00:38:56.854 --> 00:38:57.594]  Letter of mark.
[00:38:57.594 --> 00:38:59.315]  They come in, they pay, they just take it.
[00:38:59.315 --> 00:39:01.015]  Take your property, no just compensation.
[00:39:01.989 --> 00:39:05.972]  See, everybody was freaking out about the ruling, but the news didn't even tell you the real ruling.
[00:39:05.972 --> 00:39:11.737]  The news said, yeah, they say if a private interest wants it, they can get your property.
[00:39:11.737 --> 00:39:14.258]  You quote, they'll pay more taxes.
[00:39:14.258 --> 00:39:15.960]  That's the public good tie-in.
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:20.924]  But when you read the ruling, it said they can come in, take your property, and not pay you.
[00:39:20.924 --> 00:39:22.325]  Did you know that?
[00:39:22.325 --> 00:39:28.249]  And then all the Texas landowners got letters about the landowner's bill of rights.
[00:39:28.249 --> 00:39:30.451]  Oh, we passed something to give you rights!
[00:39:31.169 --> 00:39:52.385]  And it says in the huge 40-plus page letter that all Texas landowners, by all Texas landowners, people that have over 30, 40 acres, I know our family got them, and it said, listen, we're going to be putting in pipelines and taking land, and if you don't take our first offer within six months, we not only take the land, we then charge you legal fees.
[00:39:52.385 --> 00:39:55.087]  And they said, this is your new right.
[00:39:55.087 --> 00:39:58.310]  You have no recourse, sell immediately for what we offer.
[00:39:59.258 --> 00:40:00.899]  And it's already happened all over Texas.
[00:40:00.899 --> 00:40:04.042]  They come in and they say, we want your 500 acres.
[00:40:04.042 --> 00:40:09.166]  And you go, but it's valued on the tax rolls at, you know, $50,000 an acre.
[00:40:09.166 --> 00:40:10.447]  So I should be getting millions of dollars.
[00:40:10.447 --> 00:40:12.009]  And they say, nope.
[00:40:12.009 --> 00:40:15.892]  We're going to give you $1,000 an acre.
[00:40:15.892 --> 00:40:18.054]  And you're like, but that's 1 50th of what it's worth.
[00:40:18.054 --> 00:40:20.856]  And they just say, listen, that's it.
[00:40:20.856 --> 00:40:23.498]  And then six months later, they take your property.
[00:40:23.498 --> 00:40:26.541]  And if you don't leave and this has happened, they send the SWAT team.
[00:40:27.521 --> 00:40:32.183]  Men in black masks come in armored vehicles, and if you fight back, they kill you!
[00:40:32.183 --> 00:40:37.446]  It's real simple!
[00:40:37.446 --> 00:40:40.328]  And it's all happened before.
[00:40:40.328 --> 00:40:41.388]  It's all happened before.
[00:40:41.388 --> 00:40:50.733]  The Rockefellers in Illinois, and in Colorado, and in Pennsylvania, and in New York, and in New Jersey, and all over the country.
[00:40:50.733 --> 00:40:52.094]  Hundreds of cases.
[00:40:52.094 --> 00:40:54.635]  They would hire Pinkerton Security, or two other major firms,
[00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:59.480]  And I mean, this happened just 75 years ago, 80 years ago.
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:00.463]  One of the worst cases, over 100.
[00:41:01.477 --> 00:41:12.880]  And they would come into whole tent cities of people that went in, and state claims on national lands, and found gold, found silver, found bauxite, found oil, didn't matter.
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:31.026]  And they'd just ride in with guys on horses, or guys in armored cars, and they'd open up the back with a machine gun, and they'd just shoot every person, and it was admitted in the police reports, and the police were there helping, they would ride down small children, they would burn families up inside shacks, and then they'd loot every bit of money they had.
[00:41:31.676 --> 00:41:34.377]  That was their extra payment.
[00:41:34.377 --> 00:41:35.517]  Hardcore killers.
[00:41:35.517 --> 00:41:42.299]  That railroad train would pull up, they'd ride their horses right down that ramp, and they were coming to kill.
[00:41:42.299 --> 00:41:51.562]  And they killed, and they killed, and they killed, and they killed, and they killed up one side and down the other of this country, and they're gonna kill again.
[00:41:51.562 --> 00:41:52.862]  This is their time!
[00:41:52.862 --> 00:41:54.263]  Their time to rule!
[00:41:54.263 --> 00:41:55.883]  Their time for you to learn!
[00:41:55.883 --> 00:41:57.984]  And I'm so sick of them!
[00:41:58.983 --> 00:42:12.228]  Open, criminal, cess, filth, just absolute viper, venomous, pit of hell, blood-sucking, tyrannical, bully murderers!
[00:42:12.228 --> 00:42:18.851]  You read the accounts of those families burn up and those families running, it's like, pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa!
[00:42:18.851 --> 00:42:27.314]  Or you read about just 80 years ago in New Jersey and places where families would be starving to death, living in their shacks, and they'd go in to man in just a few cents more an hour,
[00:42:28.183 --> 00:42:33.965]  And here would come the National Guard with their guns and they'd mow every one of their people down right there!
[00:42:33.965 --> 00:42:39.167]  That's how this country works!
[00:42:39.167 --> 00:42:40.448]  That's how it operates!
[00:42:40.448 --> 00:42:44.410]  I ought to make a film about that.
[00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:54.093]  And if you don't think these SWAT teams, 90% of them won't follow orders, they will follow orders all the way to hell.
[00:42:54.093 --> 00:42:57.855]  They'll do whatever they're told, when they're told, how they're told.
[00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:00.951]  They will do it!
[00:43:00.951 --> 00:43:02.212]  I said I'd get to your calls.
[00:43:02.212 --> 00:43:04.333]  I just think about the open criminality.
[00:43:04.333 --> 00:43:08.535]  But see, the average person doesn't think about where water comes from.
[00:43:08.535 --> 00:43:15.779]  They just think, water comes out of the tap, and I get a bill.
[00:43:15.779 --> 00:43:20.502]  And your bill goes from $240, which is exorbitant.
[00:43:20.502 --> 00:43:22.603]  You look back 10 years ago, that same bill would have been $20.
[00:43:27.937 --> 00:43:28.257]  $15?
[00:43:28.257 --> 00:43:33.401]  $1,200 plus dollars?
[00:43:33.401 --> 00:43:41.586]  I mean, your trash pickup triples in price and you get half the service overnight, baby!
[00:43:41.586 --> 00:43:46.509]  And then you literally look at the trash company here we have locally and it's owned by the Carlionis.
[00:43:46.509 --> 00:43:49.711]  I'm being sarcastic, a well-known Italian family.
[00:43:49.711 --> 00:43:52.873]  Been national newscast about other mafia.
[00:43:52.873 --> 00:43:54.174]  That's how America works!
[00:43:56.957 --> 00:44:00.179]  That's how it runs!
[00:44:00.179 --> 00:44:03.422]  That's who rules!
[00:44:03.422 --> 00:44:07.184]  And I'm sick of them!
[00:44:07.184 --> 00:44:13.489]  Now, if you really get into the history books, every time the National Guard with Pinkerton's security mowed people down, bad stuff happened to those people.
[00:44:13.489 --> 00:44:16.391]  Oh, yeah.
[00:44:16.391 --> 00:44:21.555]  Because the cousin of the people that died
[00:44:22.782 --> 00:44:28.304]  Would spend years, would sell everything they had, would spend years quietly finding out who did it.
[00:44:28.304 --> 00:44:30.025]  And then things would happen.
[00:44:30.025 --> 00:44:40.929]  Years later, one of those old Pinkerton boys, it might be 25 years later, would walk out on their front porch, their nice little spread from stolen money, from money they got from the Rockefellers and others.
[00:44:40.929 --> 00:44:47.572]  The guy walks out to get in his little Model T to ride down to town and there's somebody waiting for him.
[00:44:47.572 --> 00:44:48.472]  Hey, you know why I'm here?
[00:44:48.472 --> 00:44:50.573]  You killed my cousin.
[00:44:50.573 --> 00:44:51.353]  Now you're gonna die.
[00:44:56.607 --> 00:44:58.928]  They still did it even knowing that would happen.
[00:44:58.928 --> 00:44:59.888]  Now that doesn't happen.
[00:44:59.888 --> 00:45:01.609]  Somebody kills your family?
[00:45:01.609 --> 00:45:03.810]  You go squealing and crying to the government.
[00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:06.591]  They killed my family for no reason!
[00:45:06.591 --> 00:45:08.412]  Government is wrong!
[00:45:08.412 --> 00:45:10.493]  And then you hear people go, the government's dumb!
[00:45:10.493 --> 00:45:12.774]  They don't believe me!
[00:45:12.774 --> 00:45:14.434]  I am innocent!
[00:45:14.434 --> 00:45:15.695]  My brother was innocent!
[00:45:15.695 --> 00:45:16.375]  I didn't do it!
[00:45:16.375 --> 00:45:18.076]  There's even video of it!
[00:45:18.076 --> 00:45:19.336]  Why don't you help?
[00:45:19.336 --> 00:45:21.077]  Don't you?
[00:45:21.077 --> 00:45:23.898]  And then the people that are abused always think it's an accident.
[00:45:23.898 --> 00:45:25.559]  It's no accident, slave!
[00:45:31.007 --> 00:45:33.948]  You're here to be sucked off of.
[00:45:33.948 --> 00:45:35.848]  That's what you're here for.
[00:45:35.848 --> 00:45:43.310]  So now you know why I don't like you spending time watching football and acting tough and strutting around with your buddies at the pool hall.
[00:45:43.310 --> 00:45:57.614]  As a man, you should be fighting this tyranny, not the facsimile of a man that Hollywood told you, some guy walking around flexing his muscles, bulging his eyes out at his neighbor, but whose tail goes between their legs when a cop asks him a question.
[00:46:01.218 --> 00:46:10.307]  A man, a real man's nice to his neighbors, but then his tail doesn't go between his legs when a cop asks him a question or pulls him over.
[00:46:10.307 --> 00:46:12.168]  See, you're not really men.
[00:46:12.168 --> 00:46:23.359]  A real man would be informed and aware of what's happening and would have their instincts alerted and would be doing everything they could to try to reverse where we're going.
[00:46:24.392 --> 00:46:34.294]  Because a real man would be having his guardian instinct employed to protect his friends, his family, his neighbors.
[00:46:34.294 --> 00:46:41.716]  The globalists have taken the guardian instinct and warped it and turned it into a looting, feeding frenzy instinct against us.
[00:46:41.716 --> 00:46:50.298]  And they've used the guardian instinct to neutralize you and said, these men who are looting you, who are pillaging you, who are taking booty from you, they're protecting you.
[00:46:51.431 --> 00:46:52.571]  It's all about your instincts.
[00:46:52.571 --> 00:46:53.772]  It's all about how you operate.
[00:46:53.772 --> 00:47:00.355]  They're punching all those buttons all day long, instead of you taking control of those buttons.
[00:47:00.355 --> 00:47:01.555]  There's two ways to do this.
[00:47:01.555 --> 00:47:03.716]  Either you're in control of the buttons, or they are.
[00:47:03.716 --> 00:47:06.837]  It's time to start using your own buttons.
[00:47:06.837 --> 00:47:08.538]  Time to start punching your own buttons.
[00:47:08.538 --> 00:47:13.720]  That's the secret to life.
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:15.781]  Either you're at the helm, or they're at the helm.
[00:47:17.725 --> 00:47:19.126]  There's the type of news I got today.
[00:47:19.126 --> 00:47:22.688]  What we'll do is we'll take your calls, then we'll go to the guests, then I'll get to it all.
[00:47:22.688 --> 00:47:23.589]  I try.
[00:47:23.589 --> 00:47:27.311]  JPMorgan Chase CEO recession just beginning, i.e.
[00:47:27.311 --> 00:47:36.418]  that means JPMorgan Chase, the private arm of the Federal Reserves, squeezing and sucking off of you just begun.
[00:47:36.418 --> 00:47:39.199]  Bush says greatest fear is another terror attack.
[00:47:39.199 --> 00:47:41.541]  Fearmonger says Al Qaeda is going to get us killed with all your rights.
[00:47:43.722 --> 00:47:49.304]  Oil steady after record, near $127 a barrel, and that's the headlines.
[00:47:49.304 --> 00:47:50.645]  Oh, oil went down a little.
[00:47:50.645 --> 00:47:56.007]  You know, it goes from $40 a barrel to $127, and it'll drop down to $125 and go to $130.
[00:47:56.007 --> 00:48:01.529]  And then they'll only do headlines for you when it drops a few dollars, creating a psychological illusion.
[00:48:01.529 --> 00:48:04.990]  I read British warfare manuals on that from the 50s.
[00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:06.191]  That's a number game they play.
[00:48:06.191 --> 00:48:07.811]  You ought to look into it for yourself.
[00:48:07.811 --> 00:48:11.953]  To always announce it when it's gone down a dollar or two, and then not announce it when it goes up ten bucks.
[00:48:13.679 --> 00:48:17.462]  Oh, oil's down only 127 a barrel.
[00:48:17.462 --> 00:48:31.492]  Oil prices were steady Wednesday after moving back from an overnight trading record near $127 a barrel on concerns that Iran may cut production.
[00:48:31.492 --> 00:48:35.615]  Democrats proposed taxes to fund veterans benefits.
[00:48:35.615 --> 00:48:36.816]  Oh, it's for the veterans!
[00:48:38.235 --> 00:48:40.657]  Yeah, the government has had plenty of money to take care of the veterans.
[00:48:40.657 --> 00:48:43.760]  We've had experts on, veterans groups on to cover that.
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:47.484]  They just keep all the money and don't give it to them.
[00:48:47.484 --> 00:48:53.229]  See, don't fill the potholes, don't have police, new radios, or the firemen with new radios.
[00:48:53.229 --> 00:48:57.553]  Advertise that the radios don't work, then demand a new tax increase that never goes to that.
[00:48:57.553 --> 00:48:58.134]  I remember seeing
[00:48:59.384 --> 00:49:12.391]  Scores of bond proposals in Austin, Texas, back when I was mainly covering local stuff 13 years ago, where there'd be a bond for $50 million, a bond for $100 million, a bond for $10 million, and then the bonds matured and they never even cash them in.
[00:49:12.391 --> 00:49:15.112]  They never even spend the money.
[00:49:15.112 --> 00:49:16.673]  Just huge investments.
[00:49:16.673 --> 00:49:18.614]  And it was always for firefighters.
[00:49:18.614 --> 00:49:21.615]  It was always for, you know, children.
[00:49:21.615 --> 00:49:26.578]  Nothing to do with it.
[00:49:26.578 --> 00:49:28.119]  Oh man, you gotta love it sometimes.
[00:49:28.119 --> 00:49:28.859]  It's just so funny.
[00:49:29.437 --> 00:49:31.198]  If it wasn't so sick.
[00:49:31.198 --> 00:49:33.019]  Democrats propose tax to fund veterans.
[00:49:33.019 --> 00:49:35.180]  Anybody making $500,000 or more?
[00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:37.681]  It's only a 2% tax to start with.
[00:49:37.681 --> 00:49:42.923]  Of course, that's how the income tax started.
[00:49:42.923 --> 00:49:44.184]  Whole new tax layer.
[00:49:44.184 --> 00:49:56.629]  They're rolling out all these new ones because you'd have to pay 100% of your earnings forever to even pay the interest on the trillions that have been created out of nothing, the debt.
[00:49:56.629 --> 00:49:57.650]  There's no way to ever pay it back.
[00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:02.721]  You can either say this debt's fraudulent, this government's criminal, or we can just all be completely bankrupt.
[00:50:02.721 --> 00:50:05.262]  And I know they gave you a black mask to feel powerful.
[00:50:05.262 --> 00:50:07.042]  You're gonna decide to be a slave.
[00:50:07.042 --> 00:50:07.582]  I understand.
[00:50:07.582 --> 00:50:08.902]  You're in control, aren't you?
[00:50:08.902 --> 00:50:10.263]  Go ahead and take the inoculation.
[00:50:10.263 --> 00:50:10.783]  Line up.
[00:50:10.783 --> 00:50:11.803]  They care about you.
[00:50:11.803 --> 00:50:14.443]  Don't listen to the nut, Alex Jones.
[00:50:14.443 --> 00:50:18.084]  Democrats propose taxes to fund veterans' benefits.
[00:50:18.084 --> 00:50:21.645]  Inflation pressures ease despite food price jump.
[00:50:21.645 --> 00:50:24.646]  AP, Federal Reserve, says inflation's down.
[00:50:24.646 --> 00:50:26.066]  You've seen prices going down.
[00:50:28.029 --> 00:50:35.736]  Federal Reserve inflation's down, and I'm a spotted Easter Bunny.
[00:50:35.736 --> 00:50:39.079]  New storm headed towards cyclone-devastated Burma.
[00:50:39.079 --> 00:50:44.683]  Oh, I'm sorry, the military dictatorship, I have to call it Myanmar.
[00:50:44.683 --> 00:50:47.686]  China bloggers cook up conspiracies.
[00:50:47.686 --> 00:50:50.228]  We'll take some calls, get into all this news.
[00:50:50.228 --> 00:50:50.709]  Stay with us.
[00:50:55.305 --> 00:51:01.390]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:07.335]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high-stress lifestyles.
[00:51:07.335 --> 00:51:11.478]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[00:51:11.478 --> 00:51:16.662]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.

[00:51:53.726 --> 00:51:55.708]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:51:55.708 --> 00:51:59.312]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:51:59.312 --> 00:52:01.634]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:52:01.634 --> 00:52:04.817]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:52:04.817 --> 00:52:10.563]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:52:10.563 --> 00:52:14.467]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[00:52:54.068 --> 00:52:56.029]  Heart disease is on the rise.

[00:53:02.991 --> 00:53:11.393]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[00:53:21.437 --> 00:53:25.858]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.

[00:53:59.432 --> 00:54:02.213]  Like cattle, are you going to go into the squeeze chutes for the slaughter?
[00:54:03.308 --> 00:54:09.572]  Gonna let them march in to body scanners to have 360 images of your naked family on their database.
[00:54:09.572 --> 00:54:16.316]  Gonna let them pick your baby's blood at birth saying they own your family's DNA.
[00:54:16.316 --> 00:54:23.320]  Gonna let them let private corporations come buy up your politicians and then quadruple the price of your water just to start.
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:25.161]  Gonna let them squeeze and have their way with you.
[00:54:27.122 --> 00:54:31.825]  By the way, these private water districts, once they incorporate, they hire their own police.
[00:54:31.825 --> 00:54:48.736]  An example of that is LCRA, private corporation, non-governmental, SWAT teams pulling people over, arresting NFL football players who beg and plead, just having their way, just having their way, having their way, having their way.
[00:54:48.736 --> 00:54:54.320]  It's all about getting the slaves, all about having their way, all about being a big man.
[00:54:55.803 --> 00:54:58.185]  All about enforcing for the masters.
[00:54:58.185 --> 00:55:00.427]  All about taking your water, taking your food.
[00:55:00.427 --> 00:55:01.988]  All about controlling you.
[00:55:01.988 --> 00:55:05.251]  All about taking your future.
[00:55:05.251 --> 00:55:06.351]  Steve in Chicago.
[00:55:06.351 --> 00:55:09.554]  By the way, Wayne Madsen has been harassed.
[00:55:09.554 --> 00:55:12.296]  Wayne Madsen for the DC Madam situation.
[00:55:12.296 --> 00:55:13.297]  We're going to have him pop in.
[00:55:13.297 --> 00:55:16.539]  Big developments there up on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:55:16.539 --> 00:55:17.780]  Steve in Chicago.
[00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:18.281]  You're on the air.
[00:55:18.897 --> 00:55:26.842]  Yes, I'd like to say a big congratulations to the West Virginians for beating back a marauding, rampaging black beast.
[00:55:26.842 --> 00:55:39.590]  Now, I don't know if you saw this, but... Oh yes, wait a minute, Jay Rockefeller, Jay Rockefeller was on stage, it's on YouTube, exactly West Virginia, endorsing Obama.
[00:55:39.590 --> 00:55:45.534]  It's obviously a University of Chicago deep cover operation, and I think
[00:55:45.996 --> 00:55:53.219]  I want to take one second to say I'd like to have a celebratory victory dance with the V.A.
[00:55:53.219 --> 00:55:57.981]  West Virginia Mountain Mama.
[00:55:57.981 --> 00:55:59.321]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[00:55:59.321 --> 00:56:02.863]  I just can't hear the music you're playing.
[00:56:02.863 --> 00:56:05.764]  We don't need to call people black-based.
[00:56:05.764 --> 00:56:09.245]  We don't need to play into the tribalism they use to control us.
[00:56:09.245 --> 00:56:10.826]  Barack Obama is bad.
[00:56:10.826 --> 00:56:12.527]  Hillary is bad.
[00:56:12.527 --> 00:56:13.347]  McCain is bad.
[00:56:14.378 --> 00:56:17.861]  I mean, I hear even all the Patriot Talk shows do nothing but cover this election.
[00:56:17.861 --> 00:56:19.862]  It doesn't matter.
[00:56:19.862 --> 00:56:21.724]  It's a joke, it's a fraud.
[00:56:21.724 --> 00:56:24.226]  The only real candidate is Ron Paul.
[00:56:24.226 --> 00:56:35.355]  And he's done a great job educating people and probably gonna speak at the convention and there's gonna be a big revolt that'll bring a lot of attention to what's happening and I'm all for a revolt as long as there isn't a quote claim that he's the nominee.
[00:56:35.355 --> 00:56:38.497]  Unless McCain gets caught with his hand in the cookie jar in the time.
[00:56:38.497 --> 00:56:43.381]  I just don't think you'd see the establishment then push Ron Paul before they're gonna bring in Mitt Romney then.
[00:56:44.011 --> 00:56:45.031]  Has anybody thought about that?
[00:56:45.031 --> 00:56:50.292]  They're going to bring in folks that have the most delegates after McCain if that magic scenario happened to happen.
[00:56:50.292 --> 00:56:52.752]  I'm just being realistic here.
[00:56:52.752 --> 00:56:56.173]  But Steve, I know a lot of people are really hyped up here.
[00:56:56.173 --> 00:56:58.153]  It's all staged, okay?
[00:56:58.153 --> 00:56:59.374]  They're all in on it.
[00:56:59.374 --> 00:57:02.734]  Barack Obama and Hillary, they're going to end up running together, probably.
[00:57:02.734 --> 00:57:06.395]  And then you are going to... What's going to happen then?
[00:57:06.395 --> 00:57:09.455]  You're actually saluting Hillary Clinton.
[00:57:09.455 --> 00:57:11.656]  Oh my gosh.
[00:57:11.656 --> 00:57:13.216]  Elias in Ohio, go ahead.
[00:57:14.997 --> 00:57:15.797]  Hello.
[00:57:15.797 --> 00:57:16.938]  Hi.
[00:57:16.938 --> 00:57:18.018]  Hi, Alex.
[00:57:18.018 --> 00:57:19.919]  I'm so happy to get on your show.
[00:57:19.919 --> 00:57:22.219]  Well, I'm happy to speak to you.
[00:57:22.219 --> 00:57:22.820]  What's on your mind?
[00:57:22.820 --> 00:57:38.685]  I wanted to ask a question about 9-11, and I was looking at some of the things you guys, one of the programs you guys had on YouTube, and it was talking about drone planes going into the buildings.
[00:57:39.847 --> 00:57:46.773]  Okay, if that was so, then where are the people that were on the original planes that didn't go into the building?
[00:57:46.773 --> 00:57:49.455]  Okay, you're saying one of my programs.
[00:57:49.455 --> 00:57:53.758]  Do you know what, was it one of my films or someone else's?
[00:57:53.758 --> 00:58:02.666]  No, maybe it was the guy that you have on that does the investigations, the young guy that you have filling in for you.
[00:58:02.666 --> 00:58:04.027]  Jason Burness?
[00:58:04.027 --> 00:58:06.769]  Yeah, I think I saw him on one of his YouTube programs.
[00:58:07.777 --> 00:58:11.038]  I tell you what, stay there and I'll try to answer this on the other side.
[00:58:11.038 --> 00:58:15.700]  I mean, to go ahead and answer some of it, then we'll get Debbie J. Smith on at the end after.
[00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:21.982]  To answer some of your question now, it is not up to us to prove what happened.
[00:58:21.982 --> 00:58:26.183]  We know the official story is a lie and a fraud and we've proven they're lying.
[00:58:26.183 --> 00:58:27.244]  Okay?
[00:58:27.244 --> 00:58:35.226]  We'll be right back and I'll try to elaborate on this.
[00:58:35.226 --> 00:58:36.467]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:44.222]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:44.222 --> 00:58:45.643]  It is a big idea.
[00:58:45.643 --> 00:58:48.464]  A new world order.
[00:58:48.464 --> 00:58:53.366]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:58:53.366 --> 00:58:56.187]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:58:56.187 --> 00:58:58.308]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:58:58.988 --> 00:59:02.149]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:59:02.149 --> 00:59:09.473]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:59:12.503 --> 00:59:17.944]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:59:17.944 --> 00:59:21.825]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:59:21.825 --> 00:59:24.386]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:59:24.386 --> 00:59:25.546]  Most people have no idea.
[00:59:25.546 --> 00:59:26.326]  They're not after money.
[00:59:26.326 --> 00:59:27.586]  They have all the money they need.
[00:59:27.586 --> 00:59:28.607]  They're after power.
[00:59:28.607 --> 00:59:29.747]  That's what they're after these years.

[00:59:46.495 --> 00:59:48.897]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:48.897 --> 00:59:51.659]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:58.442 --> 01:00:00.203]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:00.203 --> 01:00:01.784]  You want answers?
[01:00:01.784 --> 01:00:03.344]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:03.344 --> 01:00:07.526]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:07.526 --> 01:00:15.050]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:15.050 --> 01:00:18.091]  Okay, we're talking to Alyssa in Ohio.
[01:00:18.091 --> 01:00:18.372]  W.J.
[01:00:18.372 --> 01:00:20.713]  Smith coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:20.713 --> 01:00:21.793]  Talk about a lot of key issues.
[01:00:21.793 --> 01:00:25.435]  Stay with us for that.
[01:00:25.435 --> 01:00:27.576]  Wayne Madsen's been harassed by the Federales.
[01:00:28.735 --> 01:00:30.977]  For exposing the DC Madam situation.
[01:00:30.977 --> 01:00:32.919]  We'll have him popping in later.
[01:00:32.919 --> 01:00:34.781]  A lot more.
[01:00:34.781 --> 01:00:46.152]  She was asking, you know, if we're surmising that they took control of the aircraft by remote control, then what do they do with the other passengers?
[01:00:46.152 --> 01:00:49.515]  I believe that it was the aircraft.
[01:00:49.515 --> 01:00:51.257]  I believe that the passengers were on board.
[01:00:51.892 --> 01:01:06.323]  And I believe, because of what I've been told from inside sources and what some of the real phone calls from air phones said, not the fake calls at 30,000 feet from regular cell phones that are impossible, that I can't breathe, there's some kind of gas in the cabin, there's a smoke, help me.
[01:01:06.323 --> 01:01:10.065]  You know, there were several calls saying that.
[01:01:10.065 --> 01:01:20.053]  And hundreds of other points and data, you know, when you study something for years, pore over it, study other operations, look at what they've done, look at their technologies,
[01:01:21.015 --> 01:01:29.290]  Uh, how the computers quote malfunctioned on a day with 85% plus bookings on the flights but match on the East Coast.
[01:01:29.290 --> 01:01:31.594]  But these flights were all at exactly 22% booking.
[01:01:33.331 --> 01:01:48.021]  And then how the hijackers' names weren't on the manifest and later were, and all the planting of evidence, and their bags getting stuck at the airport, and leaving their cars parked with all these admissions in it, and the passport floating down magically out of the sky when the black boxes were destroyed.
[01:01:48.021 --> 01:01:51.903]  Then the firefighters saying they found the black boxes were ordered to turn them in and shut up.
[01:01:51.903 --> 01:01:56.426]  I mean, on and on and on, but... We know they're lying about the official story.
[01:01:56.426 --> 01:01:58.587]  We have the pieces, so we know they did it.
[01:01:58.587 --> 01:02:01.069]  The question is, I mean, we can say, why did Building 7 blow up?
[01:02:01.761 --> 01:02:06.806]  You know, at 525 in the afternoon, eight hours later, after the others fell.
[01:02:06.806 --> 01:02:13.072]  Was Flight 93 that went down into Shanksville, was it going there?
[01:02:13.072 --> 01:02:16.235]  Was it going to be the next, you know, the third building to be hit?
[01:02:16.235 --> 01:02:20.379]  All built as a media spectacle as the first plane hits, everybody tunes in.
[01:02:20.379 --> 01:02:22.120]  Second plane hits, the whole world tunes in.
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:25.243]  Third plane hits, you know, pandemonium.
[01:02:25.243 --> 01:02:25.944]  Three's the charm.
[01:02:27.333 --> 01:02:32.936]  Uh, did the happy hooligans out of North Dakota stationed in Virginia for the drill, did they not follow orders and shoot it down?
[01:02:32.936 --> 01:02:33.976]  We were told that.
[01:02:33.976 --> 01:02:36.658]  We know there was an award ceremony, a lot of evidence there.
[01:02:36.658 --> 01:02:38.118]  We even know the name of the pilot.
[01:02:38.118 --> 01:02:43.861]  Did that stop that plane from going to seven, or was it really going to the Capitol, where they ordered stand down by the air defenses?
[01:02:43.861 --> 01:02:46.882]  Uh, would they really have had martial law to hit the Capitol?
[01:02:46.882 --> 01:02:48.443]  I don't know.
[01:02:48.443 --> 01:02:50.704]  Um, but,
[01:02:51.394 --> 01:02:52.976]  We know they're lying.
[01:02:52.976 --> 01:02:53.957]  That's the point.
[01:02:53.957 --> 01:03:07.830]  We know if we go look at their story, we can then prove it's all a lie, and then they're covering up, and then they have the motive, then they stage other attacks before they admit they've staged, and then you add in all the other evidence, and then you know it's them as an investigator.
[01:03:07.830 --> 01:03:08.711]  Does that answer your question?
[01:03:09.631 --> 01:03:12.392]  Yes, I believe that they did it.
[01:03:12.392 --> 01:03:13.532]  Don't get me wrong.
[01:03:13.532 --> 01:03:22.373]  That was just something that had caught my attention and I was like, wow, you know, what kind of things does it take to do something like that?
[01:03:22.373 --> 01:03:26.214]  I mean, what kind of technology and what do they do with those poor people?
[01:03:26.214 --> 01:03:28.995]  But I believe, you know, that it happened the way it did.
[01:03:28.995 --> 01:03:29.555]  Well, Joe Kennedy Jr.
[01:03:29.555 --> 01:03:30.995]  in 1943 was flying in a P-38 Lightning, I believe.
[01:03:37.302 --> 01:03:43.286]  In a chase plane behind a B-17 drone cruise missile.
[01:03:43.286 --> 01:03:45.708]  They loaded the B-17 full of explosives.
[01:03:45.708 --> 01:03:48.170]  You can go look up the case on Wikipedia if you want.
[01:03:48.170 --> 01:03:49.531]  And he died a secret mission.
[01:03:49.531 --> 01:03:51.953]  They just declassified it about 10 years ago.
[01:03:51.953 --> 01:03:54.294]  And he was chasing it, remote controlling it.
[01:03:54.294 --> 01:03:55.935]  The Germans weren't the only ones.
[01:03:55.935 --> 01:03:59.078]  It's just that he had to stay within a few miles of it.
[01:03:59.078 --> 01:04:02.280]  And the German folk wolves and Messerschmitts came up and got him.
[01:04:03.196 --> 01:04:03.396]  Uh-huh.
[01:04:33.326 --> 01:04:34.047]  Right.
[01:04:34.047 --> 01:04:40.711]  I've seen stuff like that, and it's just... I mean, it's just... I'm just so... It upsets me.
[01:04:40.711 --> 01:04:44.233]  I'm so angry that this is all that's going on, and I was listening to you earlier.
[01:04:44.233 --> 01:04:44.673]  Stay there.

[01:08:02.329 --> 01:08:09.476]  We got Pastor David J. Smith, decades and decades fighting the New World Order, been publishing Newswatch Magazine since the early 80s.
[01:08:11.801 --> 01:08:18.145]  I've got him here to talk about the clergy response teams, preparing everyone for martial law, how to go to the FEMA camps.
[01:08:18.145 --> 01:08:19.306]  That's not me saying that.
[01:08:19.306 --> 01:08:20.987]  That's mainstream news.
[01:08:20.987 --> 01:08:23.108]  Smiling and saying to go to the camps.
[01:08:23.108 --> 01:08:27.291]  Oh, it's so wonderful.
[01:08:27.291 --> 01:08:34.655]  We'll also talk about the intimidation, the attacks on free speech, what he thinks of what's happening with the staged election and so much more.
[01:08:34.655 --> 01:08:38.818]  But going back to Alyssa in Ohio, you had a point you wanted to finish.
[01:08:38.818 --> 01:08:40.779]  I just wanted to say that I am just
[01:08:41.949 --> 01:08:49.931]  As you were saying earlier, I am so hurt and just so devastated as to where our nation is going.
[01:08:49.931 --> 01:09:06.636]  And I look, I do, as you do sometimes, when I'm driving home or I'm going somewhere and I just look out of my sunroof of my car and I'll just think about how beautiful the earth is and our children and the animals and how it's just going to all be destroyed.
[01:09:06.636 --> 01:09:09.737]  And I just hope and pray that God will bless us.
[01:09:10.973 --> 01:09:16.879]  Some of us fighters are here because I am trying to fight with you guys against the new world order.
[01:09:16.879 --> 01:09:18.580]  I am trying to wake up people.
[01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:26.708]  I talk to my family, my friends, people at my job, and I just hope that the Lord blesses us that we can come together and that we can defeat them before
[01:09:27.948 --> 01:09:48.062]  You know anything else happens or I mean they've done it work, you know to assess, you know They could do you know, but the vaccinations and you know the water and the fluoride I mean just everything and it's unspeakable how many fronts they're hitting us on god bless you, and I appreciate you calling us In fact, we'll continue with calls later in the shower.
[01:09:48.062 --> 01:09:53.546]  They'll be with us a little bit in the next hour I'm trying to get the young pastor on
[01:09:54.293 --> 01:10:10.644]  Who's getting his second degree at a East Texas Bible School, there outside Mount Vernon, where he told a group of Boy Scouts, he works in the office part-time, he has to give them tours about how they need to defend the Bill of Rights Constitution, same thing he was taught in Boy Scouts, pretty mild stuff.
[01:10:10.644 --> 01:10:18.930]  Homeland Security showed up, said that is inciting people to terrorism, you can't teach the Bill of Rights, next time you'll be arrested.
[01:10:20.589 --> 01:10:25.312]  Now, that would be hard to believe if I didn't have footage in Road to Tyranny out of their own squad car.
[01:10:25.312 --> 01:10:37.600]  The state police at a checkpoint, and Abby Newman pulls up, and you see all these cars lined up, and you can see the camera from the squad car, a couple other squad cars in front of it, and it's just a random checkpoint in the middle of nowhere.
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:45.085]  So there's only about four cars ahead of her, and they come over to the car, and they say, we want to search your car, and she's, you know, we want to, you know, tell us who you are, and she said,
[01:10:45.982 --> 01:10:47.463]  Listen, this is a random checkpoint.
[01:10:47.463 --> 01:10:48.824]  You don't have probable cause.
[01:10:48.824 --> 01:10:49.905]  They say, get out of the car.
[01:10:49.905 --> 01:10:50.766]  So she gets out.
[01:10:50.766 --> 01:10:51.467]  She doesn't resist.
[01:10:51.467 --> 01:10:53.288]  They charge her with resisting.
[01:10:53.288 --> 01:10:58.833]  And she was found not guilty for that by a jury because of their squad car video.
[01:10:58.833 --> 01:11:01.635]  But again, resisting is not following their orders now.
[01:11:01.635 --> 01:11:03.476]  They throw felonies on you for that.
[01:11:03.476 --> 01:11:04.737]  No conscience.
[01:11:04.737 --> 01:11:07.680]  Then they get in the back and they find a Patriot Games VHS video.
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:09.221]  She likes Harrison Ford.
[01:11:09.221 --> 01:11:15.386]  She's a married, you know, retired out of the Navy lady going into town for canning supplies, as I said, very Al-Qaeda-ish.
[01:11:16.172 --> 01:11:23.216]  And she's there, and they get in the back of the car, and they go, my gosh, look at all this paraphernalia!
[01:11:23.216 --> 01:11:24.256]  And he goes, what is it?
[01:11:24.256 --> 01:11:29.619]  And he goes, Patriot Games, watch the movie, Alex Jones, Police State 2000.
[01:11:29.619 --> 01:11:30.799]  Wait a minute, what's this?
[01:11:30.799 --> 01:11:34.041]  Pocket Constitution, is that legal?
[01:11:34.041 --> 01:11:34.801]  Is that illegal?
[01:11:34.801 --> 01:11:38.143]  And they start going, I don't know if you're allowed to have a constitution.
[01:11:38.143 --> 01:11:39.464]  Folks, it's on video.
[01:11:40.171 --> 01:11:41.512]  It's on video.
[01:11:41.512 --> 01:11:47.377]  It's so amazing to a normal person or someone who has any education or knows.
[01:11:47.377 --> 01:11:49.359]  I mean, they've sworn oaths to it.
[01:11:49.359 --> 01:11:52.602]  Then we have FEMA in Kansas City saying the Founding Fathers are terrorists.
[01:11:52.602 --> 01:11:56.966]  The FBI training manual saying, and then flyers to police call.
[01:11:56.966 --> 01:12:00.209]  Call the police if somebody's got a UN bumper sticker.
[01:12:00.209 --> 01:12:01.310]  Get us out of the UN.
[01:12:01.310 --> 01:12:04.112]  Go ahead and arrest them.
[01:12:04.112 --> 01:12:06.014]  That's in law enforcement magazines.
[01:12:06.733 --> 01:12:08.875]  And a lot of cops listening, you've been exposed to this.
[01:12:08.875 --> 01:12:10.476]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:12:10.476 --> 01:12:18.182]  So I wanted to bring Pastor David J. Smith up about this because now, two years ago, we had a pastor in Pennsylvania, then one in Ohio.
[01:12:18.182 --> 01:12:21.024]  Pastor Butch Paul here on the network covered it.
[01:12:21.024 --> 01:12:24.887]  We brought it out to a big audience here, but he broke it.
[01:12:24.887 --> 01:12:25.907]  We got the documents.
[01:12:25.907 --> 01:12:27.128]  We posted them.
[01:12:27.128 --> 01:12:27.729]  Butch broke it.
[01:12:27.729 --> 01:12:28.429]  We got the documents.
[01:12:28.429 --> 01:12:29.310]  Give him credit where credit's due.
[01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:31.992]  We put the documents up with the blacked out name of the preacher.
[01:12:31.992 --> 01:12:35.034]  They still knew who it was and went after him and threatened him.
[01:12:35.034 --> 01:12:36.015]  He has a big church.
[01:12:36.775 --> 01:12:37.196]  We're good to go.
[01:12:58.127 --> 01:13:01.148]  NBC and others reported, but they said it was good.
[01:13:01.148 --> 01:13:05.270]  People say, well you report mainstream media, they're a bunch of liars.
[01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:06.710]  Why are you quoting them?
[01:13:06.710 --> 01:13:08.351]  No, no, no, no.
[01:13:08.351 --> 01:13:11.892]  Most of the time they tell the truth, they just put a spin on it that it's good.
[01:13:11.892 --> 01:13:17.735]  And they said martial law is good, and they have the pastor going, do what the government says.
[01:13:17.735 --> 01:13:22.677]  We now bring you to Pastor David J. Smith to talk about that, Romans 13, all of it.
[01:13:22.677 --> 01:13:24.617]  Pastor, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:13:24.617 --> 01:13:25.698]  It's my pleasure, Alex.
[01:13:26.801 --> 01:13:35.543]  Just tell us a little bit about yourself first, Newswatch Magazine, the website, everything you do a little bit, and then get into your take on what's happening.
[01:13:35.543 --> 01:13:39.543]  Okay, we started Newswatch Magazine in August of 1980.
[01:13:39.543 --> 01:13:44.284]  That was the first issue we published ever since.
[01:13:44.284 --> 01:13:47.785]  And we watch world news in the light of Bible prophecy.
[01:13:47.785 --> 01:13:55.286]  We talk about a lot of the same things that you do, except we give scripture from the Bible showing how this is rising.
[01:13:56.440 --> 01:14:01.123]  And how it's going to affect us, whom it's going to affect.
[01:14:01.123 --> 01:14:03.405]  And so anyway, we've done this for years.
[01:14:03.405 --> 01:14:09.589]  We were on radio from 1982 all the way through till about four years ago.
[01:14:09.589 --> 01:14:23.159]  And now we have television programs that we rotate all across the country and we're on DirecTV, Central Standard Time on Channel 367, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday night at 11 p.m.
[01:14:23.159 --> 01:14:24.760]  And we talk about the same things.
[01:14:26.615 --> 01:14:35.162]  Now, for those who are listening to your program and who have not responded before, this is a one-time offer.
[01:14:35.162 --> 01:14:40.006]  We would offer you a one-year free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:14:40.006 --> 01:14:42.588]  All I would have to do would be to call our toll-free number, 800-516-8736.
[01:14:42.588 --> 01:14:46.791]  Okay, now, what do you want to talk about?
[01:14:46.791 --> 01:14:47.731]  Well, I want your
[01:14:55.649 --> 01:14:59.431]  Okay, basically, we were founded as a Christian nation, and those in the liberal media
[01:15:20.239 --> 01:15:23.900]  They will try to deny it till the cows come home, but they can't do it.
[01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:26.400]  It's in all the documents that we have.
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:38.502]  Every single state within the United States, all of the preambles, all of the constitutions, all of our forefathers said that this is a Christian nation.
[01:15:38.502 --> 01:15:44.643]  Therefore, we were founded upon Christian beliefs, better known as the Ten Commandments.
[01:15:44.643 --> 01:15:49.684]  They gave us the Bill of Rights because they saw what was happening in Europe.
[01:15:50.663 --> 01:16:04.186]  There was a church and state combination, and the state would follow the direction of this church, and anyone who did not agree with what was going on, then they were persecuted.
[01:16:04.186 --> 01:16:16.348]  Our government wanted to make sure that we had a... that no church, single church organization, would gain control and be able to have that massive power.
[01:16:16.348 --> 01:16:17.248]  They also saw
[01:16:17.924 --> 01:16:24.966]  But in every case, they would always disarm the people, and therefore they had no way to stand up for their rights.
[01:16:24.966 --> 01:16:28.768]  That's why they put the Second Amendment to the Constitution.
[01:16:28.768 --> 01:16:39.371]  The First Amendment, the freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and so on, because they had no regress of their grievances before kings.
[01:16:39.371 --> 01:16:45.673]  And so our entire Constitution was built for what was going on at that time,
[01:16:46.431 --> 01:16:54.737]  And the way that they were going to sever those relationships with Europe and create a free society.
[01:16:54.737 --> 01:17:09.749]  Now, unfortunately, our Constitution was written in such a way that a Mr. Charles Merriman, back in the 1930s, was hired by Franklin Delano Roosevelt to change the Constitution to a democracy.
[01:17:10.959 --> 01:17:23.847]  And he said that our Constitution was loosely written, and they could create court cases to interpret it, and they would change it to a socialized government.
[01:17:23.847 --> 01:17:26.269]  And that's exactly what's happened.
[01:17:26.269 --> 01:17:36.595]  Now, every socialized government, when you read Marxism and Leninism and so on, you'll find that their first step is socialism.
[01:17:37.276 --> 01:17:44.521]  And in order to go on to the communist man, you have to go and create a dictatorship.
[01:17:44.521 --> 01:17:53.727]  Eliminate the weak people, the resistors, and then, supposedly, the state will wither away over a period of time.
[01:17:53.727 --> 01:17:56.329]  Now that's nothing but a hoax.
[01:17:56.329 --> 01:18:02.874]  There has not been one single communist country, and communism was founded by the international bankers
[01:18:04.028 --> 01:18:14.672]  Who are wanting to set up a one world economic system, no coins, no cash, no checks, only a mart or a chip.
[01:18:15.459 --> 01:18:19.702]  So that you can run it across a scanner and they can control you that way.
[01:18:19.702 --> 01:18:30.089]  And by the way, if people aren't Christians and don't believe this, it doesn't matter because they're announcing they're going to face scan everybody when you buy and sell to stop people from quote buying cigarettes and beer.
[01:18:30.089 --> 01:18:31.490]  See, that's their excuse.
[01:18:31.490 --> 01:18:33.532]  The cashless grid is going in.
[01:18:33.532 --> 01:18:35.994]  Whether you deny it or not, folks, it's happening.
[01:18:35.994 --> 01:18:37.294]  That's right.
[01:18:37.294 --> 01:18:42.238]  And they always come up with a logical reason that is acceptable by people.
[01:18:43.175 --> 01:18:52.839]  As to why they're implementing a program, but they always carry it the second and the third step until finally they reach the conclusion they want.
[01:18:52.839 --> 01:18:56.761]  A more solid police state.
[01:18:56.761 --> 01:19:01.263]  And that's what's happening with this young man and all of these ministers.
[01:19:01.263 --> 01:19:08.486]  They've been visited, they've been talked to about telling the people that they should obey the government at all costs.
[01:19:09.471 --> 01:19:11.212]  Well, that's not what he says in Romans 13.
[01:19:11.212 --> 01:19:24.922]  Romans 13 of the Bible does say that you should get along and you should follow the laws of the nation as long as those laws don't violate God's laws.
[01:19:24.922 --> 01:19:32.747]  Or as long as they're not usurpers of the legitimate government, then you are to obey it.
[01:19:32.747 --> 01:19:36.589]  Our legitimate government is a constitutional republic.
[01:19:36.589 --> 01:19:37.050]  Stay there.
[01:19:37.050 --> 01:19:38.611]  I want to come back after the break.
[01:19:39.966 --> 01:19:46.040]  With David J. Smith, and get into this, and get more into Romans 13.
[01:19:51.377 --> 01:20:01.785]  USCivilFlags.org is here to help Americans remember as well as our leaders that every man and woman is sovereign and that we're all endowed by our Creator with life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:20:01.785 --> 01:20:10.813]  The Sovereign Civil Flag is available at USCivilFlags.org and is a symbol of our desire to return America to the dreams that our forefathers envisioned.

[01:20:44.795 --> 01:20:45.275]  That's 646-498-5309.
[01:20:45.275 --> 01:20:46.216]  It is a big idea.
[01:20:46.216 --> 01:20:47.236]  A new world order.
[01:20:47.236 --> 01:20:48.056]  In the near future.
[01:20:57.651 --> 01:21:00.694]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:21:00.694 --> 01:21:03.537]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:21:03.537 --> 01:21:06.320]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:09.524]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:21:09.524 --> 01:21:16.831]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:21:19.861 --> 01:21:25.305]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:21:25.305 --> 01:21:28.627]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:21:28.627 --> 01:21:31.749]  The Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:21:31.749 --> 01:21:32.910]  Most people have no idea.
[01:21:32.910 --> 01:21:33.690]  They're not after money.
[01:21:33.690 --> 01:21:34.971]  They have all the money they need.
[01:21:34.971 --> 01:21:35.952]  They're after power.
[01:21:35.952 --> 01:21:37.093]  That's their after-mission.
[01:21:37.093 --> 01:21:41.856]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[01:21:48.620 --> 01:21:49.701]  You have been warned.
[01:21:53.303 --> 01:21:56.704]  Imagine walking down the street and hearing footsteps behind you.
[01:21:56.704 --> 01:22:01.527]  They get closer and closer, and suddenly you have a sense something bad is going to happen.
[01:22:01.527 --> 01:22:04.028]  What are you going to do to defend yourself?
[01:22:04.028 --> 01:22:08.711]  Tebowtech specializes in non-lethal self-defense products for you and your family.

[01:22:51.271 --> 01:22:54.994]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[01:22:54.994 --> 01:23:00.038]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[01:23:00.038 --> 01:23:05.502]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[01:23:05.502 --> 01:23:15.991]  Though the people of the U.S., where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reigning them in and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[01:23:16.471 --> 01:23:20.874]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[01:23:20.874 --> 01:23:23.656]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[01:23:23.656 --> 01:23:27.218]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[01:23:27.218 --> 01:23:40.227]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.

[01:23:48.236 --> 01:23:49.498]  The message of his kingdom.
[01:24:07.449 --> 01:24:18.648]  Don't you know that it's time to get on board And let this train keep on riding, riding on
[01:24:26.937 --> 01:24:52.422]  Pastor David J. Smith continues, in the whole Bible, and even if people aren't Christians out there, they need to understand that the government is going, taking over the churches, using religion, using Christians, but not just Christianity, they're infiltrating all the major religions, and telling them, worship the government, do what they say, turn your guns in, we have the documents, it's now been in the news, it's so diabolical, and they tell them, render unto Caesar,
[01:24:53.002 --> 01:24:56.625]  When all of the disciples were killed for not following orders.
[01:24:56.625 --> 01:24:58.747]  When Jesus went into the money changers.
[01:24:58.747 --> 01:24:59.968]  When he wouldn't bow to government.
[01:24:59.968 --> 01:25:01.930]  When the prophets were always rebuking the government.
[01:25:02.535 --> 01:25:07.019]  And then they twist it and say, no, you've got to worship the government, all authorities of God.
[01:25:07.019 --> 01:25:10.241]  Well, wait a minute then, so the Founding Fathers were bad fighting England?
[01:25:10.241 --> 01:25:14.184]  Or we were bad to fight Hitler because Hitler was authority, so he was of God?
[01:25:14.184 --> 01:25:16.166]  It is so sick!
[01:25:16.166 --> 01:25:28.435]  And then now, Pastor David J. Smith, the on-the-face of it, the tyranny of the government having a relationship secretly with the pastors, I mean, that's right out of the Soviet Union.
[01:25:29.827 --> 01:25:44.730]  It absolutely is, and not only that, there's a lot more in-depth to this, and I don't know sometimes whether to even bring it up or not, but I guess if we're looking for truth, we better say it.
[01:25:44.730 --> 01:25:52.772]  Jesuit universities, there are Jesuits who, that's the Society of Jesus, and from the Catholic Church,
[01:25:54.051 --> 01:26:08.339]  They go out into organizations, even though they're priests, they dress just like the average person, infiltrate organizations, the Knights of Malta, and their goal is to bring everybody in the world back to the Catholic Church.
[01:26:08.339 --> 01:26:16.063]  There's 24 organizations, minimum, working inside the United Nations to bring around a one-world religion.
[01:26:16.063 --> 01:26:20.805]  In Clayton, Missouri, there's a United Nations library, and when I lived in St.
[01:26:20.805 --> 01:26:22.306]  Louis, I went to it,
[01:26:23.761 --> 01:26:35.471]  And in one of the books by Dag Hammarskjöld, he said that the head of the United Nations would be the political pontiff for the world when they establish their world government.
[01:26:35.471 --> 01:26:39.295]  But then there would be a religious pontiff of Rome.
[01:26:39.295 --> 01:26:41.797]  And so once again, church and state together.
[01:26:42.688 --> 01:26:58.316]  And so they're trying to bring an ecumenical movement here of all churches, and a part of it is this going in and talking with the pastors, telling them that guns are bad, they're evil, they should be willing to turn them in.
[01:26:58.316 --> 01:27:09.381]  And all of this is from a program, a written paper by Major Peters, and he put it, it was called Warrior Class.
[01:27:10.504 --> 01:27:23.273]  He said that patriots and those who would hold out for nationalism, who believed in God and the Bible, were now to be considered an enemy doctrine.
[01:27:23.273 --> 01:27:38.984]  And therefore, anybody that holds out and wants America to remain free and outside the New World Order, anybody that wants to have a free reign of Christianity in America, they are the enemies.
[01:27:40.726 --> 01:27:45.049]  Any patriot is the enemy.
[01:27:45.049 --> 01:27:53.334]  Now, our government may not come out and say that, but they've shown it by court cases.
[01:27:53.334 --> 01:27:56.436]  We know they have these prison camps.
[01:27:56.436 --> 01:28:00.139]  Rex 84, under the Ronald Reagan administration, built them.
[01:28:01.434 --> 01:28:04.216]  Well, now it's in the Houston Chronicle.
[01:28:04.216 --> 01:28:06.497]  Now it's admitted all over the news.
[01:28:06.497 --> 01:28:07.458]  Right.
[01:28:07.458 --> 01:28:15.202]  And in 19...oh, I forget what year it was, but anyway, there was a court case in Houston, Texas.
[01:28:15.202 --> 01:28:20.505]  And a man sued the government because of this RECS 84 program.
[01:28:20.505 --> 01:28:30.491]  And the court said, you haven't been imprisoned and nobody else has, and you haven't been harmed by it, so we're going to throw your case out of court.
[01:28:31.989 --> 01:28:43.223]  They did say in a footnote at the end of it, you have proven your case that there are civilian prison camps built in America.
[01:28:43.223 --> 01:28:48.149]  But since you haven't been harmed, then your case is dismissed.
[01:28:48.149 --> 01:28:49.411]  That's right, you don't have standing.
[01:28:50.074 --> 01:28:50.975]  That's right.
[01:28:50.975 --> 01:28:55.580]  But going back, that was then, this is now, it's all admitted.
[01:28:55.580 --> 01:29:01.567]  I mean, if you read PD 51, or you read the John Warren Defense Authorization Act, it says the president's a dictator.
[01:29:01.567 --> 01:29:05.272]  That means Hillary, Obama, McCain, whoever's coming, Bush.
[01:29:05.272 --> 01:29:06.053]  They're just puppets.
[01:29:06.053 --> 01:29:08.035]  People need to understand, it's not just about the personality.
[01:29:08.035 --> 01:29:08.616]  It moves on.
[01:29:09.556 --> 01:29:11.717]  And it says it's for insurrection.
[01:29:11.717 --> 01:29:13.057]  It's to fight the American people.
[01:29:13.057 --> 01:29:16.778]  I want you to talk about that when we get back, and I want to hear more about these Jesuits.
[01:29:16.778 --> 01:29:17.038]  Okay.
[01:29:17.038 --> 01:29:22.739]  On the other side with Pastor David J. Smith, just an amazing researcher.
[01:29:22.739 --> 01:29:29.741]  And we'll talk about, since he brings this up, Tony Blair converting to Catholicism to be the new EU head.
[01:29:29.741 --> 01:29:30.481]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:30.481 --> 01:29:34.662]  Baby, baby, I'm gonna leave you.
[01:29:41.434 --> 01:29:45.340]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:45.340 --> 01:29:48.043]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:51.502 --> 01:29:56.025]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:29:56.025 --> 01:30:01.128]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:30:01.128 --> 01:30:02.629]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:30:02.629 --> 01:30:06.232]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[01:30:51.323 --> 01:31:04.472]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:31:04.472 --> 01:31:15.540]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:31:15.540 --> 01:31:17.781]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[01:31:18.942 --> 01:31:20.683]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[01:31:20.683 --> 01:31:26.826]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[01:31:42.475 --> 01:31:45.097]  We're in a no-holds-barred information war.
[01:31:45.097 --> 01:31:50.941]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[01:31:50.941 --> 01:31:56.764]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[01:31:56.764 --> 01:32:01.848]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[01:32:02.188 --> 01:32:07.573]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[01:32:07.573 --> 01:32:13.478]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[01:32:13.478 --> 01:32:19.704]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[01:32:19.704 --> 01:32:23.207]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[01:32:23.487 --> 01:32:28.310]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:29.351]  Do your part.
[01:32:29.351 --> 01:32:31.973]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now.

[01:33:11.464 --> 01:33:15.785]  You that hide behind walls.
[01:33:15.785 --> 01:33:17.706]  You that hide behind desks.

[01:33:52.550 --> 01:33:56.231]  He knows about every subject, a newshound just like myself.
[01:33:57.277 --> 01:34:05.745]  He's been out there just for, since 1980, fighting the New World Order, or longer, 28 plus years, so we're very, very honored to have him with us.
[01:34:05.745 --> 01:34:07.246]  We're going to go back to him in just a moment.
[01:34:07.246 --> 01:34:24.581]  Don't forget that not only am I a documentary filmmaker, not only do my documentary films wake people up like none others we've seen out there, your purchase of the books and videos at our secure online video and bookstore, online at infowars.com, makes what we do here possible.
[01:34:25.325 --> 01:34:30.008]  And I'm here working hard for you Monday through Friday for four hours from 11 to 2 p.m.
[01:34:30.008 --> 01:34:31.548]  Central, 11 to 3 p.m.
[01:34:31.548 --> 01:34:31.828]  Central.
[01:34:31.828 --> 01:34:34.050]  We just expanded the show about a month ago.
[01:34:34.050 --> 01:34:36.531]  And I come in on Sundays from 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:34:36.531 --> 01:34:41.694]  with a special end-of-week, start-of-week, final edition.
[01:34:41.694 --> 01:34:46.416]  So you can always join me for the final edition Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:34:46.416 --> 01:34:47.997]  as well, not just the weekday show.
[01:34:48.786 --> 01:34:52.449]  And so please go to Infowars.com.
[01:34:52.449 --> 01:34:59.834]  I mean, Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement is an incredible film, and it's shot in high definition.
[01:34:59.834 --> 01:35:00.875]  It's so well done.
[01:35:00.875 --> 01:35:06.059]  The history of the New World Order, who they are, how they operate, what their master plan is, what they're doing.
[01:35:06.059 --> 01:35:06.880]  None of it's rumor.
[01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:08.721]  It's all documented fact.
[01:35:08.721 --> 01:35:12.544]  You need to have this two-hour, 20-minute film, 40 minutes of extras.
[01:35:12.544 --> 01:35:15.266]  So it's three hours on one disc.
[01:35:15.266 --> 01:35:18.008]  American drug war, exposing how the government ships the drugs in.
[01:35:18.815 --> 01:35:24.040]  And Hollywood advertises how they're cool so the kids use them and they throw you in prison for using their drugs.
[01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:26.022]  We've got that for $24.95.
[01:35:26.022 --> 01:35:29.425]  It has three hours of extras on it.
[01:35:29.425 --> 01:35:31.888]  So that's five hours for $24.95.
[01:35:31.888 --> 01:35:37.113]  And it is just got a buzz all over the country right now.
[01:35:37.113 --> 01:35:38.114]  I consulted on it.
[01:35:38.114 --> 01:35:39.796]  I'm in the extras.
[01:35:39.796 --> 01:35:41.998]  And American Drug War
[01:35:43.032 --> 01:35:46.493]  Of course, is something that everybody needs to see.
[01:35:46.493 --> 01:35:48.094]  You may know they ship the drugs in.
[01:35:48.094 --> 01:35:50.275]  You may know that war on drugs is a fraud.
[01:35:50.275 --> 01:35:52.035]  You may know it's a problem reaction solution.
[01:35:52.035 --> 01:36:02.139]  Your neighbors, your police chief, your pastor, your cousins, your boss, your employees, people in the community, they don't know.
[01:36:02.139 --> 01:36:03.199]  So get American Drug War.
[01:36:03.199 --> 01:36:04.800]  It's not even out on DVD yet.
[01:36:05.464 --> 01:36:08.485]  But I had a deal as consultant to be able to have before it even came out.
[01:36:08.485 --> 01:36:15.448]  You can get it one place, InfoWars.com, and you can get it for $5 cheaper than it's going to be selling for.
[01:36:15.448 --> 01:36:17.509]  It's going to be selling for $29.95.
[01:36:17.509 --> 01:36:19.830]  We've got it $24.95 at InfoWars.com.
[01:36:19.830 --> 01:36:23.032]  We've got Washington You're Fired by William Lewis, new video.
[01:36:23.032 --> 01:36:33.296]  We've got Seeds of Deception, two DVD films, audio CD for $19.95, so two films and a whole CD of information on the poison GMO food that
[01:36:34.532 --> 01:36:36.013]  It's hurting so many of us.
[01:36:36.013 --> 01:36:36.494]  Infowars.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:36:36.494 --> 01:36:39.517]  Or you can also write to us at 3001 South Lamar Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:36:39.517 --> 01:36:42.320]  And don't forget, all 18 of my films are online in super high quality.
[01:36:53.932 --> 01:36:55.533]  We're going to stream sections of my new film
[01:37:12.353 --> 01:37:15.056]  9-11 Chronicles Part 1 Truth Rising.
[01:37:15.056 --> 01:37:20.901]  We're going to stream that here first before it's even posted for the main audience at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:37:20.901 --> 01:37:29.729]  We're going to be streaming excerpts of that to give you an idea of why you want to be a PrisonPlanet.tv member and with the added capital and support we will get a bigger office, more employees,
[01:37:30.269 --> 01:37:31.650]  I'm doing what David J. Smith's doing.
[01:37:31.650 --> 01:37:44.800]  I'm going to start a TV show on cable, on the dish, but it takes capital to do that, so support us by buying the videos and books, and then make copies of my videos, get them out to people, InfoWars.com.
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:48.984]  Going back to Pastor David J. Smith, who's going to be with us to the bottom of the next hour, maybe longer.
[01:37:48.984 --> 01:37:51.726]  Got some other guests popping in later, too.
[01:37:51.726 --> 01:37:55.769]  Continuing, sir, because I have always exposed the Jesuits.
[01:37:55.769 --> 01:37:59.672]  I've had Tex Mars on, I've had a bunch of other guests on over the years.
[01:38:00.478 --> 01:38:04.380]  And then some people have erroneously claimed that I don't talk about the Catholic Church.
[01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:08.482]  They've erroneously claimed because there's a black guy named Alex Jones.
[01:38:08.482 --> 01:38:10.843]  That's what got them started on it.
[01:38:10.843 --> 01:38:15.805]  First, they said I was a Jesuit because they heard there was a Jesuit named Alex Jones.
[01:38:15.805 --> 01:38:19.487]  And then, once they'd already accused me, they couldn't say they were wrong.
[01:38:19.487 --> 01:38:25.549]  And that's how the whole thing started about 10 years ago, was there's a black guy who's a Jesuit named Alex Jones.
[01:38:25.549 --> 01:38:27.050]  Doesn't matter, I'm not a black guy.
[01:38:27.050 --> 01:38:28.611]  I'm not 50-something years old.
[01:38:29.645 --> 01:38:37.591]  Doesn't matter, I'm guilty, and my whole family's Protestants, and famous Protestants in Texas who raised Colonel Travis's son.
[01:38:37.591 --> 01:38:43.676]  But I want you to know, say whatever you want about the Jesuits, I have constantly talked about it.
[01:38:43.676 --> 01:38:51.802]  Blair kicks off campaign to become EU President, London Guardian, this was back on January, and it said that what we predicted
[01:38:52.423 --> 01:38:57.091]  When he converted about eight months ago to Catholicism, we said, watch, he's going to be the new EU president.
[01:38:57.091 --> 01:39:01.279]  Because you're right, Rome says that is their political arm.
[01:39:01.279 --> 01:39:04.445]  And Ratzinger, of course, Hitler Youth, calling for a world government.
[01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:12.322]  But the problem is I don't hate Catholics, and then I don't exaggerate and lie about your common Catholics.
[01:39:12.322 --> 01:39:16.384]  And so, well, I mean, the big thing is this egomaniac sent me an email.
[01:39:16.384 --> 01:39:20.605]  It's got a similar one from somebody else saying, you're going to interview me or I'm going to expose you.
[01:39:20.605 --> 01:39:22.986]  And if I get a threat like that, I go, well, I'd like to interview you, but...
[01:39:23.759 --> 01:39:33.806]  A guy just like yesterday said, you will interview me, I know more than you, I've been around longer than you, you will interview me, or I am going to talk bad about you and knock yourself out.
[01:39:33.806 --> 01:39:36.307]  Go ahead, maniacs, but you are real.
[01:39:36.307 --> 01:39:37.748]  You're a real researcher.
[01:39:37.748 --> 01:39:39.369]  You bring out what you can prove.
[01:39:39.369 --> 01:39:42.171]  And I agree, the Jesuits are right at the top of the New World Order.
[01:39:42.171 --> 01:39:44.292]  Tell us about them.
[01:39:44.292 --> 01:39:51.657]  Well, Bill Clinton said that his mentor was the late Professor Carol Quigley of Georgetown University.
[01:39:52.125 --> 01:39:54.967]  Which is a Jesuit university.
[01:39:54.967 --> 01:39:59.469]  He wrote a huge, huge book, Tragedy and Hope.
[01:39:59.469 --> 01:40:02.631]  And in there, he said that he was an insider for 25 years.
[01:40:02.631 --> 01:40:06.734]  He saw their books, he knew their plan, what their purpose was.
[01:40:06.734 --> 01:40:10.756]  And he said the entire world was going to be controlled.
[01:40:10.756 --> 01:40:15.139]  From your birth to your death, everything was going to be controlled.
[01:40:16.115 --> 01:40:26.419]  Well, this is nothing but pure socialism, and then you want to throw in a little fascism because of the corporate structure that's going to be with this new world order.
[01:40:26.419 --> 01:40:45.747]  But the thing is, the Jesuits, the Society of Jesus, they and the Knights of Malta all have sworn allegiance that they are trying to get every sand of grain, sand of, you know, piece of sand on Earth.
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:53.321]  All land masses and the people that inhabit them to turn back to the Catholic Church.
[01:40:53.321 --> 01:41:09.205]  And the present Pope actually stated, and all of us know it if we watch the news, and he said that the Protestants and anybody that was not a Catholic was defective in doctrine and needed to come back to them.
[01:41:09.205 --> 01:41:14.706]  Well, that's a problem for me because I believe he's the defect.
[01:41:16.594 --> 01:41:20.876]  And not the Bible, and that's what we go by.
[01:41:20.876 --> 01:41:25.239]  And so the Society of Jesus is working in secret.
[01:41:25.239 --> 01:41:39.746]  They go out and infiltrate all types of businesses, organizations, universities, and so on, and even churches, in order to bring them back to the Catholic Church.
[01:41:39.746 --> 01:41:44.029]  They try to undermine the virgin birth of Jesus,
[01:41:45.205 --> 01:41:50.489]  They try to undermine all biblical principles and say that they're not true?
[01:41:50.489 --> 01:42:13.364]  Well, of course, once they've undermined it, and they finally turn people back to the Vatican for religion, it becomes very easy, because when you look back in history, and I've studied it well, you go back into history and you start in 321 A.D., and you find that the Roman Empire began to change everything in the Bible.
[01:42:14.554 --> 01:42:23.819]  And then, when the Pope became the official, he was called the Pope for the first time in 16 AD.
[01:42:23.819 --> 01:42:33.664]  And then, a few years earlier, 554, he crowned one of the kings, Charlemagne, I believe, and then it became the Holy Roman Empire.
[01:42:33.664 --> 01:42:37.525]  Yeah, the Roman Empire switched into a religious empire.
[01:42:37.525 --> 01:42:39.366]  Right.
[01:42:39.366 --> 01:42:42.408]  But the thing is, they, in order to convert everybody,
[01:42:43.482 --> 01:42:50.746]  They just let them have all of their pagan practices, and then call them by Christian names.
[01:42:50.746 --> 01:42:54.668]  They let them continue to worship their idols, their gods and goddesses.
[01:42:54.668 --> 01:42:55.168]  Well, that's right.
[01:42:55.168 --> 01:43:02.192]  During World War II, Catholic churches would get bombed, and under the main altar, there'd be a Druidic sacrificial altar.
[01:43:04.302 --> 01:43:05.623]  It's really wild.
[01:43:05.623 --> 01:43:14.387]  Yeah, they built them on all the original sacrificial ley lines and sites and where druidic temples had been.
[01:43:14.387 --> 01:43:15.788]  Right.
[01:43:15.788 --> 01:43:19.670]  Now, I want to get into the whole political system with this.
[01:43:19.670 --> 01:43:31.716]  I mean, at the very top of the New World Order, because we know David Rockefeller and the UN as well are pushing the World Council and the National Council of Churches, and they're saying you can have any religion you want, just don't criticize any others.
[01:43:32.703 --> 01:43:51.910]  Oprah wants to start a church that's all New Agey, and they claim it's this new enlightenment, but you can't criticize other religions because that's hurtful, and that's the cause of war, and we've got Walter Cronkite saying that he gets his orders from Satan, making a joke, and then he's calling for world government.
[01:43:51.910 --> 01:44:00.033]  I mean, I know that they are, quote, into the occult, and I don't debate that the Catholic Church calls for a world government, Ratzinger and the guy before him.
[01:44:01.371 --> 01:44:17.924]  Pope John Paul II calling for it, and saying all religions are the same, and these giant things in Rome, there at the main Vatican City, with hundreds of religious leaders, Druids, you name it, Shaman, all saying it's the same God.
[01:44:17.924 --> 01:44:21.907]  I mean, I don't know how any Catholic could not read the Bible and say that.
[01:44:21.907 --> 01:44:25.570]  So I'm not debating when it became evil, or how it's evil, we just know
[01:44:26.230 --> 01:44:28.612]  That it certainly is part of the New World Order.
[01:44:28.612 --> 01:44:38.939]  Would you say at the very top, I mean for me at the very top of the pyramid, it is this Luciferianism, this mystery religion going back to Egypt, and then they control all the other major groups.
[01:44:38.939 --> 01:44:44.043]  I mean, it's not even a debate then who runs it, because we know it's part of it.
[01:44:44.043 --> 01:44:45.744]  But I want you to be able to elaborate.
[01:44:45.744 --> 01:44:50.308]  Do you believe that the Roman Church is at the penultimate tip of the pyramid?
[01:44:50.308 --> 01:44:54.831]  I believe that they are on the religious aspect, the top of the pyramid.
[01:44:55.726 --> 01:45:08.738]  Now, when you stop and look back on the Illuminati, which means illuminated ones, and they believe that they got their illumination from Lucifer, who rebelled against God and became Satan.
[01:45:08.738 --> 01:45:21.649]  Albert Pike had an ongoing discussion with Lemi, who took over as second after the death of Adam Weishaupt of the Illuminati.
[01:45:22.364 --> 01:45:29.406]  They wanted, uh, Pike wanted to call him Lucifer, while Lemi wanted to call him Satan.
[01:45:29.406 --> 01:45:31.867]  And so they finally decided upon Lucifer.
[01:45:31.867 --> 01:45:38.689]  And they said, we of the higher degrees must maintain the pure doctrine of Lucifer.
[01:45:38.689 --> 01:45:46.572]  But we can say to those in the 32nd, 31st, 30th degrees known down that we believe in a god, just don't tell them which one.
[01:45:47.978 --> 01:45:53.300]  And therefore... And by the way, I want Masons tuning in to know, we're not saying you're individually bad, you're deceived.
[01:45:53.300 --> 01:45:56.802]  This is why there's symbols, the pyramid, meaning compartmentalization.
[01:45:56.802 --> 01:45:58.082]  You don't know.
[01:45:58.082 --> 01:46:01.204]  See, you think the G and the compass is for God.
[01:46:01.204 --> 01:46:06.926]  You find out when you're 33rd degree that it is Lucifer, and Albert Pike wrote books, Manly P. Hall.
[01:46:06.926 --> 01:46:10.708]  Your top Masons, whose pictures hang in your halls, they wrote books.
[01:46:10.708 --> 01:46:13.309]  So it's not us saying it, it's your grandmasters.
[01:46:13.309 --> 01:46:13.589]  Go ahead.
[01:46:14.309 --> 01:46:15.630]  That's right.
[01:46:15.630 --> 01:46:22.913]  And the point I started to make was, you go back to Adam Weishaupt.
[01:46:22.913 --> 01:46:28.456]  He taught at a Jesuit university, Ingolstadt University in Bavaria, Germany.
[01:46:28.456 --> 01:46:31.357]  It became, he said, disillusion.
[01:46:31.357 --> 01:46:36.060]  And he left the Catholic Church and founded the Illuminati.
[01:46:36.060 --> 01:46:42.923]  And yet there were many, many religious people, and even ministers and so on, priests, that were a part of the Illuminati.
[01:46:44.116 --> 01:46:48.718]  On his deathbed, he recanted and said, I'm really Catholic.
[01:46:48.718 --> 01:47:00.502]  So, is this whole thing that he's created, that has come down to us today, and they're about to take the world right now, is it really the Jesuits in secret?
[01:47:00.502 --> 01:47:07.664]  And there are many other people that don't realize that they're being used in other secret societies, like Skull and Bones,
[01:47:08.656 --> 01:47:11.459]  And the Bohemian Grove and so on.
[01:47:11.459 --> 01:47:20.567]  Well, we know that the money came from the British East India Company, but the charter, and this is in their own admissions, came from Bavaria, Germany for 1832.
[01:47:20.567 --> 01:47:24.951]  Yep.
[01:47:24.951 --> 01:47:32.178]  And we know that Rothschilds and other international bankers financed all of this to get it started.
[01:47:33.257 --> 01:47:37.040]  So, how do the Hebrews tie into this, then?
[01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:41.984]  Well, see, you've got two different items here.
[01:47:41.984 --> 01:47:57.957]  Number one, there were twelve tribes of Israel, and the northern ten tribes of Israel split away from the tribe of Judah and Benjamin because Solomon's son, Rehoboam, would not give them relief from taxation.
[01:47:59.073 --> 01:48:04.196]  So they rebelled, and they became a separate nation from Judah.
[01:48:04.196 --> 01:48:08.919]  That's found in 1 Kings 11-12.
[01:48:08.919 --> 01:48:16.905]  King Sennacherib of Assyria came down in 721-718 BC and captured the northern ten tribes and sifted them through the nation.
[01:48:16.905 --> 01:48:19.446]  They lost track of who they were.
[01:48:19.446 --> 01:48:21.047]  So that left only Judah.
[01:48:21.047 --> 01:48:25.210]  They were captured by the Babylonian empire, King Nebuchadnezzar.
[01:48:26.255 --> 01:48:32.458]  He sent them back only so that the Messiah, Jesus Christ, could be born through them.
[01:48:32.458 --> 01:48:37.441]  That in 70 AD, Jerusalem was destroyed, and they were scattered.
[01:48:37.441 --> 01:48:51.789]  But then, I have a set of Jewish encyclopedias, and it says under the term, Kesar, that in 740 AD, a group of people from Turkish extracts,
[01:48:53.328 --> 01:48:56.151]  adopted the religion of Judaism.
[01:48:56.151 --> 01:48:58.352]  They're not from the tribe of Judah.
[01:48:58.352 --> 01:49:01.875]  They could not technically be called Jews.
[01:49:01.875 --> 01:49:03.537]  But they do.
[01:49:03.537 --> 01:49:05.839]  They're the house of Rothschilds.
[01:49:05.839 --> 01:49:12.184]  They are descended from Esau, who took the birthright, who Jacob took the birthright away from him.
[01:49:12.184 --> 01:49:21.592]  So here is a group of people hiding behind the cloak of being a Jew, but they're from Turkey, not the tribe of Judah.
[01:49:23.303 --> 01:49:30.970]  And they're trying to regain the wealth of the world that was given to Jacob.
[01:49:30.970 --> 01:49:35.855]  Well, I've read their own documents and that's what they believe, so you're only saying what they're saying.
[01:49:35.855 --> 01:49:37.696]  Just amazing.
[01:49:37.696 --> 01:49:42.581]  Now, getting back to the on-the-ground manifestation of this,
[01:49:43.300 --> 01:49:44.660]  Preachers call me all the time.
[01:49:44.660 --> 01:49:48.521]  I get little news articles here and there, but most of them are afraid to come on.
[01:49:48.521 --> 01:49:49.542]  But again, we have the documents.
[01:49:49.542 --> 01:49:49.982]  It's admitted.
[01:49:49.982 --> 01:49:51.462]  It's been on the news.
[01:49:51.462 --> 01:49:57.284]  I mean, how does a preacher get approached with a government, hey, we want you to tell your flock to submit to government and go to FEMA camps.
[01:49:57.284 --> 01:50:03.526]  And when there's an emergency, tell them to go to the sports stadium and turn their guns in.
[01:50:03.526 --> 01:50:11.548]  And then FEMA just leased in Des Moines, Iowa, a huge, the huge stockyards, the cattle yards, and they admitted for putting people in.
[01:50:11.548 --> 01:50:11.828]  And I mean,
[01:50:13.121 --> 01:50:16.003]  It's a bad Twilight Zone episode.
[01:50:16.003 --> 01:50:21.506]  Right, and I don't understand why any minister who's worth his salt would stand up.
[01:50:21.506 --> 01:50:26.029]  Well, you know, really, you got to take a break.
[01:50:26.029 --> 01:50:26.469]  Yeah, we do.
[01:50:26.469 --> 01:50:26.869]  Stay there.
[01:50:26.869 --> 01:50:29.330]  I want to come back and talk more about Romans 13.
[01:50:29.330 --> 01:50:33.613]  Because I've had police tell me, they go, it is of the Lord, do whatever I say.
[01:50:34.375 --> 01:50:36.596]  But if that was the case, we'd have had no Founding Fathers.
[01:50:36.596 --> 01:50:39.438]  I mean, why did Jesus then not follow the government's orders?
[01:50:39.438 --> 01:50:40.799]  I mean, it's just made up.
[01:50:40.799 --> 01:50:43.220]  But we have a pastor on with us.
[01:50:43.220 --> 01:50:47.782]  David J. Smith has a national television program as well, three times a week.
[01:50:47.782 --> 01:50:49.003]  We'll be talking to him in just a moment.
[01:50:52.523 --> 01:50:58.988]  Imagine a firefly, simple and innocent, the ability to light the night sky.
[01:50:58.988 --> 01:51:04.132]  The ozone layer unseen by the naked eye, life-sustaining.
[01:51:04.132 --> 01:51:07.754]  Our ocean, primordial soup breathes life.
[01:51:07.754 --> 01:51:09.736]  Bring the wonders of nature home.
[01:51:10.396 --> 01:51:19.082]  Soleil Salt Lamps, handcrafted from million-year-old crystal salt, will gently ionize and purify your indoor air, helping you breathe easier.

[01:51:51.431 --> 01:51:53.392]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:51:53.392 --> 01:51:57.014]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:51:57.014 --> 01:51:59.476]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:51:59.476 --> 01:52:02.517]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:52:02.517 --> 01:52:08.241]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:52:08.241 --> 01:52:12.163]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[01:52:51.610 --> 01:52:55.993]  According to the EPA, our indoor air is many times more polluted than outdoor air.
[01:52:55.993 --> 01:52:58.034]  One child in 10 suffers from asthma.
[01:52:58.034 --> 01:52:59.795]  How can we improve the air we breathe?
[01:52:59.795 --> 01:53:00.916]  The answer is clear.
[01:53:00.916 --> 01:53:03.597]  Himalayan Crystal Salt Lamps from Ionic Salts.

[01:53:48.221 --> 01:53:48.982]  Breathe the difference.
[01:54:05.499 --> 01:54:14.366]  Look, we know there's a New World Order.
[01:54:14.366 --> 01:54:19.030]  We know that every major organization is controlled by the New World Order.
[01:54:19.030 --> 01:54:21.973]  All the big institutions.
[01:54:21.973 --> 01:54:22.733]  We know that now.
[01:54:22.733 --> 01:54:24.795]  Let's move on to fighting their program.
[01:54:24.795 --> 01:54:25.756]  Standing up against it.
[01:54:25.756 --> 01:54:27.337]  Resisting it.
[01:54:27.337 --> 01:54:31.680]  David J. Smith, you were making a point.
[01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:34.563]  In Romans 13, it basically states
[01:54:35.982 --> 01:54:46.170]  That we are to obey the law unless it requires us to violate God's law.
[01:54:46.170 --> 01:54:55.577]  Now, plus basically, our forefathers gave us a republican form of government.
[01:54:55.577 --> 01:55:01.702]  A constitution and a bill of rights to protect us from tyranny.
[01:55:01.702 --> 01:55:02.623]  It was supposed to be
[01:55:03.528 --> 01:55:11.996]  Our representatives in Washington that would balance the executive department and then the judiciary.
[01:55:11.996 --> 01:55:14.338]  They would balance each other.
[01:55:14.338 --> 01:55:28.972]  But when the president of the United States and previous presidents have packed the courts with liberals and they always interpret the law instead of become a strict constitutionalist.
[01:55:30.325 --> 01:55:35.427]  Then they're the traitors, not the average American person.
[01:55:35.427 --> 01:55:39.309]  And so they are the ones that should be held accountable.
[01:55:39.309 --> 01:55:40.929]  And I want to be clear here.
[01:55:40.929 --> 01:55:47.052]  On its face, it is so asinine to say, worship all authority, do whatever it says, it's all of God.
[01:55:47.052 --> 01:55:52.314]  And I have a bunch of preachers on national TV I can play clips of, going off their government talking points.
[01:55:53.064 --> 01:55:54.204]  I mean, all authority.
[01:55:54.204 --> 01:55:55.365]  That means Pol Pot.
[01:55:55.365 --> 01:55:57.406]  That means Vlad the Impaler.
[01:55:57.406 --> 01:55:59.486]  That means Adolf Hitler.
[01:55:59.486 --> 01:56:01.307]  That means Mao Zedong.
[01:56:01.307 --> 01:56:04.948]  That means just everybody.
[01:56:04.948 --> 01:56:06.609]  That means King George III.
[01:56:06.609 --> 01:56:14.151]  I mean, that's to say, then they say our Congress should do what the President says, because he's of God.
[01:56:14.151 --> 01:56:16.132]  But wait, they're co-equal in authority.
[01:56:16.132 --> 01:56:20.413]  I mean, it is such a... And I've read all of that chapter.
[01:56:20.413 --> 01:56:22.274]  They just take Romans 13 out of context.
[01:56:22.874 --> 01:56:26.156]  No, that means that you have nothing but sheep that are led to the slaughter.
[01:56:46.559 --> 01:56:48.600]  Well, it should not be that way.
[01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:58.502]  Now, I don't necessarily advocate taking up guns and going around shooting people that are a part of the government and that kind of thing.
[01:56:58.502 --> 01:56:59.422]  No, only in defense.
[01:56:59.422 --> 01:57:03.603]  If they're putting you on FEMA trailers, you can't let them take your children.
[01:57:03.603 --> 01:57:05.424]  Well, yeah, right.
[01:57:05.424 --> 01:57:06.984]  No, I mean, that's it.
[01:57:06.984 --> 01:57:09.925]  But don't worry, folks that want to fight, that's coming soon.
[01:57:09.925 --> 01:57:13.666]  So, you've been shooting your mouths off, you're probably going to get what you want real soon.
[01:57:13.666 --> 01:57:14.186]  That's right.
[01:57:15.603 --> 01:57:22.225]  But the government of the United States right now, George Bush, has set himself up as a dictator.
[01:57:22.225 --> 01:57:32.087]  Otherwise, how can you create a North American Union, and merge three countries together, when not the Congress, nor we the people have voted upon it?
[01:57:32.087 --> 01:57:32.707]  Great point.
[01:57:32.707 --> 01:57:34.327]  Make that, flesh that point out.
[01:57:34.327 --> 01:57:38.188]  That is so huge, that Congress isn't even allowed to see the agreements.
[01:57:38.188 --> 01:57:42.829]  Congress can't see the Homeland Security, PDD 51, Continuity of Government.
[01:57:42.829 --> 01:57:45.070]  I mean this is, we're seeing dictatorship.
[01:57:46.030 --> 01:58:00.758]  Well, that's what it basically is boiled down to, and nobody in Congress has the courage to stand up to him and say, either we see with our own eyes these documents, or we're going to start impeachment.
[01:58:00.758 --> 01:58:01.438]  They won't do it.
[01:58:01.438 --> 01:58:03.900]  They don't have the courage to.
[01:58:03.900 --> 01:58:15.446]  And if they'd have done that, just like they did Bill Clinton, because George Bush, in my opinion, has done more to harm the United States since he's gone into office than Bill Clinton did.
[01:58:16.158 --> 01:58:20.200]  But you think somebody even worse is on their way.
[01:58:20.200 --> 01:58:22.841]  We'll talk about your take on Barack Obama on the other side.
[01:58:22.841 --> 01:58:24.381]  I know you wanted to mention that.
[01:58:24.381 --> 01:58:28.963]  Also, your phone calls will be with us for another 30 minutes.
[01:58:28.963 --> 01:58:32.965]  1-800-259-9231.

[01:58:44.187 --> 01:58:45.948]  A New World Order.
[01:58:45.948 --> 01:58:50.852]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:58:50.852 --> 01:58:53.673]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:58:53.673 --> 01:58:56.455]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:58:56.455 --> 01:58:59.637]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:58:59.637 --> 01:59:06.962]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:59:09.995 --> 01:59:15.419]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:59:15.419 --> 01:59:19.301]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:59:19.301 --> 01:59:21.863]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:59:21.863 --> 01:59:23.023]  Most people have no idea.
[01:59:23.023 --> 01:59:23.824]  They're not after money.
[01:59:23.824 --> 01:59:25.085]  They have all the money they need.
[01:59:25.085 --> 01:59:25.865]  They're after power.
[01:59:25.865 --> 01:59:27.226]  That's what they're after these years.

[01:59:46.360 --> 01:59:49.102]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:54.660 --> 01:59:58.441]  Pastor David J. Smith is our guest.
[01:59:58.441 --> 02:00:01.722]  Dave, Andrew, Steve, George, Don, many others.
[02:00:01.722 --> 02:00:07.184]  Your calls are coming up, I promise, right when we start the next segment.
[02:00:23.072 --> 02:00:26.214]  Love the different directions you take us in.
[02:00:26.214 --> 02:00:30.536]  We wheel a fortune there, never knowing what you'll bring up next.
[02:00:30.536 --> 02:00:34.998]  Going back to Pastor David J. Smith, we're going to give out his phone number and contact info.
[02:00:34.998 --> 02:00:37.559]  Great books, great films, great research.
[02:00:37.559 --> 02:00:44.043]  I've learned so much from him since I woke up in the last 16-17 years, since I got on air 13 years ago.
[02:00:44.043 --> 02:00:47.284]  You may have heard him as a sponsor on the network, promoting his free magazine offer.
[02:00:47.284 --> 02:00:52.727]  He's not a sponsor of myself, he's a sponsor of the network, though I would have him on if he wasn't a sponsor.
[02:00:53.317 --> 02:00:55.165]  We really appreciate it, but we want to make that clear.
[02:00:59.767 --> 02:01:03.129]  Again, back to the grassroots effect of this.
[02:01:03.129 --> 02:01:09.853]  It's so on its face, reading Kafka in 1984, but not just fiction, reading history.
[02:01:09.853 --> 02:01:24.601]  I mean, to have secret police everywhere, to have them intimidating people, to have them telling kids in schools as part of curriculum to spy on their parents, to have CPS kidnapping millions of children a year, millions, over a million and a half, to have
[02:01:26.008 --> 02:01:29.230]  The video of FEMA teaching the Founding Fathers were bad.
[02:01:29.230 --> 02:01:30.391]  I mean, that's case closed.
[02:01:30.391 --> 02:01:34.574]  The government's bankrupt, evil, bad, foreign own and run.
[02:01:34.574 --> 02:01:42.059]  I mean, it's foreign groups are buying up all the water supplies, doubling, tripling prices, mass raping economically is happening.
[02:01:42.059 --> 02:01:44.821]  I want to talk to you later about what's happening with the economy, the election.
[02:01:44.821 --> 02:01:45.962]  But I mean, you get what I'm saying.
[02:01:45.962 --> 02:01:49.404]  It's just, it's, it's, people say, oh, they're, you know, when are they going to take over?
[02:01:49.404 --> 02:01:51.246]  They have taken over, Pastor.
[02:01:51.246 --> 02:01:51.526]  I mean,
[02:01:52.824 --> 02:01:56.506]  The coup d'etat that's already taken place, there's no doubt about that.
[02:01:56.506 --> 02:01:59.767]  And that coup d'etat has given them the total control.
[02:01:59.767 --> 02:02:17.295]  And one thing that we need to understand is, if people are Democrats, we have proven, we just completed a three-part series about Bill and Hillary Clinton, and how Hillary Clinton has had close ties, her and Bill Clinton, with the Communist movement.
[02:02:17.295 --> 02:02:21.757]  Even went into Italy, into the Communist sectors, to learn about Antonio Gramsci's
[02:02:22.409 --> 02:02:23.310]  I don't know.
[02:02:43.408 --> 02:02:48.351]  And America's share is seven-tenths of one percent of every sale if it passes.
[02:02:48.351 --> 02:02:55.695]  And we wrote a story about that, and that's going to be the global ID card as a regional global sales tax, which of course Neil Bortz is pushing.
[02:02:55.695 --> 02:02:56.695]  Go ahead.
[02:02:56.695 --> 02:03:03.319]  Well, this has now gone to committee, and so it'll come up within the next three to six months, surely.
[02:03:04.592 --> 02:03:10.254]  And so far, I've not been able to get one word from any of my Senators or Representatives.
[02:03:10.254 --> 02:03:11.715]  And no one knows about it.
[02:03:11.715 --> 02:03:21.399]  There's a whole flotilla of bills very close to passing for national sales taxes, new set income taxes on $500,000 or more.
[02:03:21.399 --> 02:03:22.999]  The public thinks that's the elite.
[02:03:22.999 --> 02:03:24.540]  No, that's the middle class.
[02:03:24.540 --> 02:03:27.821]  I mean, with the inflation, everybody's going to be worth half a million soon.
[02:03:27.821 --> 02:03:29.522]  It'll take that to buy a hamburger.
[02:03:29.522 --> 02:03:29.822]  Yeah.
[02:03:30.422 --> 02:03:35.307]  Well, I got an email from Kenya, Africa.
[02:03:35.307 --> 02:03:40.831]  Now this is where Obama's father grew up.
[02:03:40.831 --> 02:03:43.254]  And he was Muslim.
[02:03:43.254 --> 02:03:48.138]  And the email said, don't let Mr. Obama fool you.
[02:03:48.138 --> 02:03:53.643]  He is a racist, and he is also a Muslim.
[02:03:54.941 --> 02:04:02.704]  And they gave the technical term in Arabic, but I don't read it, so anyway, they explained it.
[02:04:02.704 --> 02:04:08.427]  And they said it means you penetrate inside of, say, a Christian organization.
[02:04:08.427 --> 02:04:16.390]  No, no, that's in the Koran, that you're allowed to shave and allowed to not follow the customs as part of war, and they have a term for infiltrating.
[02:04:16.390 --> 02:04:17.450]  That's it.
[02:04:17.450 --> 02:04:20.812]  And so, they said that's exactly what he's doing.
[02:04:21.463 --> 02:04:33.013]  And when he comes into the presidency of the United States, if he does, then he will come out and probably take the oath of office on the Koran.
[02:04:33.013 --> 02:04:34.815]  Well, we'll talk about that on the other side.
[02:04:34.815 --> 02:04:37.777]  And we'll talk about Bill and Hillary Clinton.
[02:04:37.777 --> 02:04:38.198]  Stay with us.
[02:04:47.523 --> 02:04:48.184]  Greetings!
[02:04:48.184 --> 02:04:54.738]  My name is Dr. Buell von Scheidt with the White Paper Chronicles from the main polluted stream media.

[02:04:59.286 --> 02:05:00.906]  His name is Steve Schenk.
[02:05:00.906 --> 02:05:03.427]  His radio show called Fearless Radio.
[02:05:03.427 --> 02:05:08.469]  He says solution to all the craziness in America is just get independent and healthy.

[02:05:35.298 --> 02:05:36.298]  This is Steve.

[02:06:49.912 --> 02:06:52.273]  We're already under a scientific dictatorship.
[02:06:52.273 --> 02:06:55.775]  Martial Law is coming, but it's not going to arrive overnight.
[02:06:55.775 --> 02:06:57.756]  It's going to be incremental.
[02:06:57.756 --> 02:06:59.737]  This country is already teetering on the edge.
[02:06:59.737 --> 02:07:02.839]  Any incident, small or large, could trigger a total takeover.
[02:07:02.839 --> 02:07:04.299]  Anything could be the final push.

[02:07:24.993 --> 02:07:28.876]  You will be dealing with a force that has been in training for years, preparing for this takeover.

[02:07:59.882 --> 02:08:04.063]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:04.063 --> 02:08:08.123]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:18.499 --> 02:08:19.661]  Okay, I want to go to your calls.
[02:08:19.661 --> 02:08:26.412]  I want to go to David and Andrew and Steve and callers in Florida and Texas and everywhere else, and we're going to do it.
[02:08:26.412 --> 02:08:28.556]  But David J. Smith, you were getting into Barack Obama.
[02:08:28.556 --> 02:08:32.943]  Listen, we've got the documents, the control agent numbers now.
[02:08:33.817 --> 02:08:47.604]  Communism, as you know, talking about the Jesuit at Georgetown, Carol Quigley, Bill Clinton's mentor, the Rhodes Historian for the Rhodes Secret Society, which is an Anglophile, quote, Protestant group.
[02:08:47.604 --> 02:08:52.987]  See, at the top of the pyramid it all nexuses together.
[02:08:52.987 --> 02:08:57.149]  But I agree with you about the Catholic Church being one of its main, you know, power modes right at the top of the pyramid.
[02:08:58.556 --> 02:09:08.001]  But we see there that Kordmeier, the guy that ran the op killing Kennedy with E. Howard Hunt, he was the section chief in London.
[02:09:08.001 --> 02:09:09.921]  The Clintons were under his control.
[02:09:09.921 --> 02:09:15.164]  We know they sent them all over to communist meetings in Russia, China, training in Italy.
[02:09:16.574 --> 02:09:21.015]  Uh, and we know the Clintons for their low-level minions for the communist squads they used.
[02:09:21.015 --> 02:09:24.236]  They pardoned a bunch of communists that killed cops and others.
[02:09:24.236 --> 02:09:26.477]  I mean, we understand that's their cover.
[02:09:26.477 --> 02:09:38.019]  And again, I'm not saying communism isn't the banker's system, but the bankers created it, as you know, to con people back into serfdom, and that's now been declassified, that Mao Zedong was put in by the CIA, and, you know, they even put that on the History Channel.
[02:09:38.019 --> 02:09:40.120]  But, again, it's all these subtleties.
[02:09:40.120 --> 02:09:44.561]  It's about how it's all interconnected at the higher levels, and I want to get your take on this.
[02:09:45.936 --> 02:09:57.279]  Uh, we then see, uh, the same thing with, you know, Barack Obama being handled by Zbigniew Brzezinski, the big anti-communist on the surface, and all these other top globalists, and the Rockefellers, and the Rothschilds.
[02:09:57.279 --> 02:10:07.382]  Then we hear, oh no, he's a Muslim, uh, and then, you know, we know he's got Reverend Wright, who says a lot of stuff that's true, and then says some racist stuff on the other end of it, and hangs out with Farrakhan.
[02:10:08.522 --> 02:10:14.546]  So, I mean, I'm not doubting that his dad lived in Malaysia, lived in Africa, was a Muslim.
[02:10:14.546 --> 02:10:16.727]  I mean, it's really, it is right there.
[02:10:16.727 --> 02:10:19.208]  That's incredible evidence.
[02:10:19.208 --> 02:10:22.730]  But at the same time, Barack Obama just endorsed Bush Sr.'
[02:10:22.690 --> 02:10:24.271]  's attack on Iraq.
[02:10:24.271 --> 02:10:30.694]  And so I think that those are their, quote, credentials for the communities they sprung from to control them.
[02:10:30.694 --> 02:10:34.476]  But there's no doubt Barack Obama is New World Order, not Muslim.
[02:10:34.476 --> 02:10:35.857]  Just like Bill Clinton, sure.
[02:10:36.517 --> 02:10:47.540]  Uh, Gary Aldridge wrote the book, you know, high-level FBI in the White House, and they were putting crack pipes and VI linen pins on the Christmas tree, and they were all wearing them, and that's confirmed.
[02:10:47.540 --> 02:10:50.620]  But again, that was meant to get out that they're communists.
[02:10:50.620 --> 02:10:54.261]  Do you, A, agree with me, B, want to comment on what I just said?
[02:10:54.261 --> 02:10:57.182]  Well, no, I believe everything you just said.
[02:10:57.182 --> 02:11:02.923]  And, uh, the key is that all of these top personnel, they are Luciferian.
[02:11:03.934 --> 02:11:12.942]  They created communism to be atheistic, to pit them in a cold war against the Western world of supposed Christianity.
[02:11:12.942 --> 02:11:15.545]  Then they're going to bring them together in a final conflict.
[02:11:16.275 --> 02:11:19.596]  And they're going to destroy atheism and Christianity, both.
[02:11:19.596 --> 02:11:21.837]  And that's what Albert Pike wrote.
[02:11:21.837 --> 02:11:24.919]  That's what's so incredible, is this is all publicly available.
[02:11:24.919 --> 02:11:35.663]  How could somebody in 1876 write letters and books predicting everything that happened if they didn't have some type of supernatural agency behind them?
[02:11:35.663 --> 02:11:38.204]  Tell folks about that, then we're going to go to one of these young men.
[02:11:38.964 --> 02:11:47.488]  And perhaps even the pastor for an update on this East Texas Baptist Bible School and Homeland Security saying don't talk about the Constitution or you're a terrorist.
[02:11:47.488 --> 02:11:49.409]  A quick update from them and then your calls.
[02:11:49.409 --> 02:11:51.830]  But a comment on Albert Pike.
[02:11:51.830 --> 02:12:01.614]  Okay, Albert Pike in August of 1871, the 15th of August, wrote a letter to Giuseppe Massini.
[02:12:01.614 --> 02:12:04.155]  Massini was a revolutionary head of the Illuminati.
[02:12:04.972 --> 02:12:09.954]  He said there had to be three world wars, and many revolutionary wars.
[02:12:09.954 --> 02:12:16.417]  And in the third of these world wars, they would pit the atheist against Christianity.
[02:12:16.417 --> 02:12:20.478]  And they would destroy and conquer both of them at the same time.
[02:12:20.478 --> 02:12:21.939]  And what do we see today?
[02:12:21.939 --> 02:12:23.119]  China?
[02:12:23.119 --> 02:12:24.380]  Russia?
[02:12:24.380 --> 02:12:28.021]  We see the United States in Iraq.
[02:12:28.021 --> 02:12:32.243]  China and Russia have made peace pacts with Iran.
[02:12:33.730 --> 02:12:45.392]  And so, if the United States goes into Iran, there could be the beginning of this final war, in which they will destroy the West and atheism at the same time.
[02:12:45.392 --> 02:12:49.573]  And then, because you see, they already have a military.
[02:12:49.573 --> 02:12:52.053]  It's called Blackwater, USA.
[02:12:52.053 --> 02:12:57.914]  Headed by Eric Prince, who is a knight of Malta.
[02:12:57.914 --> 02:13:00.995]  Sworn to bring the Pope as head of the world.
[02:13:02.230 --> 02:13:06.231]  And so Blackwater is in Iraq right now.
[02:13:06.231 --> 02:13:08.692]  And they're giving Iraqi citizens trouble.
[02:13:08.692 --> 02:13:10.353]  They're just shooting them down on the streets.
[02:13:10.353 --> 02:13:13.394]  And America gets credit for it.
[02:13:13.394 --> 02:13:19.976]  And it's not our military doing it, but it's these mercenaries outside the military code.
[02:13:19.976 --> 02:13:24.398]  And they can't be tried in the military courts of America.
[02:13:24.398 --> 02:13:28.319]  Because they're private mercenaries.
[02:13:28.319 --> 02:13:31.580]  And so when you put all this together, you see that Albert Pike
[02:13:32.367 --> 02:13:35.568]  All of his program is about to come to pass.
[02:13:35.568 --> 02:13:36.128]  And V.I.
[02:13:36.128 --> 02:13:41.610]  Lenin laid down the final program to go hand-in-glove with his.
[02:13:41.610 --> 02:13:43.370]  They would first take Eastern Europe.
[02:13:43.370 --> 02:13:43.990]  They did it.
[02:13:43.990 --> 02:13:45.411]  World War II.
[02:13:45.411 --> 02:13:47.131]  Then they would take the masses of Asia.
[02:13:47.131 --> 02:13:48.632]  They've done that.
[02:13:48.632 --> 02:13:53.153]  And then they said they would surround the United States and it would fall like a ripe fruit into their hands.
[02:13:54.321 --> 02:13:57.642]  What do we see from Mexico all the way to the tip of South America?
[02:13:57.642 --> 02:13:59.363]  They're all socialists now.
[02:13:59.363 --> 02:14:02.184]  And by the way, this has been well-publicized for a hundred years.
[02:14:02.184 --> 02:14:06.426]  This is the British Naval Museum, has the letters, the books.
[02:14:06.426 --> 02:14:09.907]  This is the guy whose picture hangs in all your Masonic halls.
[02:14:09.907 --> 02:14:11.167]  And that's the thing.
[02:14:11.167 --> 02:14:17.610]  I found with these globalists, they always push atheism, but when you get around them and really read their writings, they are deeply religious.
[02:14:18.230 --> 02:14:27.177]  It's like Dr. Eric Bianca at UT who says he wants to kill 90% of us and he works in the biology lab and has connections to their level 4 bioweapons lab.
[02:14:27.177 --> 02:14:30.179]  The FBI, by the way, did go question him because we demanded it.
[02:14:30.179 --> 02:14:32.981]  You want to question somebody real, go talk to this guy.
[02:14:32.981 --> 02:14:37.204]  He got a 95% standing ovation when he was giving a speech saying, kill everybody.
[02:14:37.204 --> 02:14:40.286]  The Texas Academy of Sciences, that's the point, is they're all into this.
[02:14:41.625 --> 02:14:43.610]  And, uh, he's on the UT website.
[02:14:43.610 --> 02:14:49.743]  I mean, it's his UT page on UT, uh, dressed as a Druid, saying, uh, talking about Lucifer.
[02:14:50.672 --> 02:15:13.350]  I mean, it's every time... I mean, even if you don't believe in God, I mean, I have to say, when I was younger, I would doubt God and doubt things, but then, you know, but then when you see that the elite really believe it and are obsessed with it, and are doing this, and seem to know the future... I mean, how did this guy 130-something years ago write about there'll be three world wars, and he detailed each one?
[02:15:14.358 --> 02:15:20.660]  I mean, how was he able to say the final one will be between the Muslims and the Christians and the Atheists and the Middle East?
[02:15:20.660 --> 02:15:24.802]  I mean, how did he know that?
[02:15:24.802 --> 02:15:26.742]  Somebody gave him help.
[02:15:26.742 --> 02:15:29.844]  Well, he said, I feel the power of Lucifer seething in my hands.
[02:15:29.844 --> 02:15:31.444]  That's right.
[02:15:31.444 --> 02:15:39.547]  And even in skull and bones, when they lay in the coffin, they rise up born again because they felt the seething energy of Lucifer flowing through them.
[02:15:41.494 --> 02:15:50.280]  And so, we are fighting a battle, and it's a secret battle, but it's a spiritual battle, and that's what the American people don't understand.
[02:15:50.280 --> 02:15:54.203]  Okay, uh, the pastor, the young pastor is pastoring today.
[02:15:54.203 --> 02:16:03.909]  He's unable to come on right now, but his friend Steve Barber, uh, there, um, witnessing all of this, is able, uh, to come on with just like a two-minute update.
[02:16:03.909 --> 02:16:06.671]  I'm not gonna, not gonna keep him, uh, long.
[02:16:06.671 --> 02:16:09.453]  His friend Jeff has gone through quite a bit, uh, but,
[02:16:10.487 --> 02:16:13.550]  I'm talking to you.
[02:16:13.550 --> 02:16:17.633]  Any updates on what's happened Monday since we exposed that Homeland Security came in?
[02:16:17.633 --> 02:16:23.678]  Headline, Fez accused student of terror and espionage for talking to Cub Scout group about Constitution.
[02:16:23.678 --> 02:16:29.262]  East Texas pastor threatened by anonymous men in dark suits for giving talk to Boy Scouts about Bill of Rights.
[02:16:29.262 --> 02:16:31.764]  Then we have footage of FEMA teaching police this.
[02:16:31.764 --> 02:16:33.366]  This is really happening.
[02:16:33.366 --> 02:16:37.209]  Any other info or anything you want to say to Pastor David J. Smith?
[02:16:39.185 --> 02:16:43.928]  Yes sir, I just wanted to say that I'm proactive and I don't wait around.
[02:16:43.928 --> 02:16:47.211]  I push back when things are pushed.
[02:16:47.211 --> 02:16:56.517]  And so what I've done is I've contacted Senator Karen Johnson in Arizona, her office, and also Congressman Ron Paul's office.
[02:16:56.517 --> 02:16:58.558]  I've heard back from Karen Johnson's office.
[02:16:58.558 --> 02:17:03.662]  I'm waiting to hear back from Ron Paul because I feel that if I get Ron Paul
[02:17:04.455 --> 02:17:08.319]  I'm bored with what's going on with my friend because this is a very serious thing.
[02:17:08.319 --> 02:17:16.787]  We're now the feds are calling a guy who's done nothing wrong and is actually doing his duty as an American a terrorist and committing espionage.
[02:17:16.787 --> 02:17:18.188]  That's a very serious thing.
[02:17:19.211 --> 02:17:27.755]  You know, we've just got to send a message to people that you criminals.
[02:17:27.755 --> 02:17:31.157]  Karen Johnson is in Arizona.
[02:17:31.157 --> 02:17:34.899]  And so that's not her jurisdiction here in Texas.
[02:17:34.899 --> 02:17:36.059]  Go ahead.
[02:17:36.059 --> 02:17:45.864]  Right, but I just wanted to make people with the government itself aware of this because I just figured, you know, these are high-level people, you know, to basically, you know,
[02:17:46.534 --> 02:17:57.782]  Get some help involved with this because honestly Alex, I'm concerned for myself and my situation with my family, but I'm more concerned for Jeff because he's high profile on this now.
[02:17:57.782 --> 02:18:02.905]  And I'll just say this, this is the main thing I wanted to let people know.
[02:18:02.905 --> 02:18:08.449]  I've been letting people know about the interview we did Monday and what Jeff related that he's actually gone through.
[02:18:09.048 --> 02:18:23.190]  Uh, the responses I'm getting are anything from like, oh, that's really horrible, you know, uh, too, well, I'm not, I still don't want to, you know, get on board with this because I want to keep focused on what I'm doing, preaching the gospel.
[02:18:23.789 --> 02:18:27.033]  But you know, the thing is, is that silence is complicity.
[02:18:27.033 --> 02:18:36.885]  And, you know, this is what I encouraged Jeff in the other day, that if you don't go public with this, you're actually being part of the problem rather than part of the solution.
[02:18:36.885 --> 02:18:37.706]  Absolutely.
[02:18:37.706 --> 02:18:38.667]  And what I want to say is,
[02:18:40.968 --> 02:18:46.533]  My sense of duty and right and honor overrides any fear that I have in this.
[02:18:46.533 --> 02:18:50.115]  Okay, Steve, thank you so much for popping in to give us an update.
[02:18:50.115 --> 02:18:53.198]  Yeah, a lot of people are saying, okay, it's true.
[02:18:53.198 --> 02:18:56.200]  You're a terrorist if you talk about the Bill of Rights or Constitution.
[02:18:56.200 --> 02:18:59.283]  And yeah, they're saying, yeah, you got FEMA video of them teaching this.
[02:18:59.283 --> 02:19:00.564]  Maybe we should.
[02:19:00.564 --> 02:19:01.725]  Maybe it's bad.
[02:19:01.725 --> 02:19:02.986]  It's of the Lord.
[02:19:02.986 --> 02:19:06.368]  Let's follow their orders and never talk about the Bill of Rights again.
[02:19:06.368 --> 02:19:08.190]  I mean, how deceived is that, Pastor?
[02:19:09.733 --> 02:19:13.216]  You're as deceived as you can be if you think that's the truth.
[02:19:13.216 --> 02:19:18.402]  Because the Constitution of the United States is the official law of the land.
[02:19:18.402 --> 02:19:30.794]  And anybody that tells us that we should not follow the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, which protects us from tyranny, we have automatically laid down and said, tyrants, take over.
[02:19:30.794 --> 02:19:31.074]  Okay.
[02:19:31.969 --> 02:19:34.532]  We are going to your calls immediately.
[02:19:34.532 --> 02:19:38.536]  All these points are so great about the Jesuits and about Barack Obama.
[02:19:38.536 --> 02:19:39.897]  I didn't want to interrupt those.
[02:19:39.897 --> 02:19:43.080]  We're going to take your calls on the other side of this quick break.
[02:19:43.080 --> 02:19:45.182]  Dave, Andrew, and many others, stay with us.
[02:19:45.182 --> 02:19:45.662]  We're going to you.

[02:20:35.055 --> 02:20:35.616]  Ask yourself,
[02:20:35.916 --> 02:20:39.137]  Why does our government not allow this crop to grow in the U.S.?
[02:20:39.137 --> 02:20:41.657]  This product is also great for pets and animals.
[02:20:41.657 --> 02:20:47.498]  Call 908-691-2608 or go to hempusa.org today.
[02:20:47.498 --> 02:21:00.161]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[02:21:00.641 --> 02:21:11.703]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[02:21:11.703 --> 02:21:15.104]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[02:21:15.104 --> 02:21:16.864]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[02:21:16.864 --> 02:21:23.006]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[02:21:30.467 --> 02:21:38.630]  Be sure to check out the huge discounts on films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, America, Freedom to Fascism, and hundreds of other titles.
[02:21:38.630 --> 02:21:41.271]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[02:21:41.271 --> 02:21:47.214]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[02:21:47.214 --> 02:21:51.475]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:21:51.475 --> 02:21:55.057]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:21:55.057 --> 02:21:58.558]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:21:58.777 --> 02:22:02.059]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:22:02.059 --> 02:22:07.561]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we've seen.
[02:22:07.561 --> 02:22:17.306]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jog a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:22:17.306 --> 02:22:18.686]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[02:22:18.686 --> 02:22:24.109]  I mean, the idea of working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead-on.
[02:22:24.589 --> 02:22:29.053]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:22:29.053 --> 02:22:30.655]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:22:30.655 --> 02:22:34.138]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.

[02:22:47.136 --> 02:22:51.520]  Prepare for an uncertain future with DVDs from the winner of 12 Telly Awards.
[02:22:51.520 --> 02:22:54.683]  Hoods Woods is the world leader in survival instructional videos.

[02:23:14.660 --> 02:23:14.981]  We're good.
[02:23:29.784 --> 02:23:30.185]  I think so.
[02:24:11.089 --> 02:24:14.650]  Let's go quick to your calls.
[02:24:14.650 --> 02:24:17.932]  Dave in California, then Andrew, Steve, Don, and others.
[02:24:17.932 --> 02:24:18.252]  Go ahead.
[02:24:18.252 --> 02:24:19.452]  You're on the air, Dave.
[02:24:19.452 --> 02:24:20.352]  Hi, Alex.
[02:24:20.352 --> 02:24:22.013]  Hello, Pastor Smith.
[02:24:22.013 --> 02:24:23.834]  Alex, you have the soul of a poet, my brother.
[02:24:23.834 --> 02:24:24.914]  Consider publishing.
[02:24:24.914 --> 02:24:29.996]  I will be the first in line to buy Treatise on Beauty and Wonder and Joy.
[02:24:29.996 --> 02:24:31.877]  Oh, you're very kind.
[02:24:31.877 --> 02:24:32.657]  It's true.
[02:24:32.657 --> 02:24:36.939]  And Pastor Smith, I have two for you and a faster one for you, Alex, if there's time.
[02:24:36.939 --> 02:24:40.480]  Pastor Smith, I'll just fire him out.
[02:24:41.622 --> 02:24:47.424]  Have you seen Dr. Catherine Albrecht's RFID treaties on the brink of a mark?
[02:24:47.424 --> 02:25:05.730]  And also, I'm a bit of a novice religiously, I know some about it, but if I was to go to speak to pastors one-on-one and try to find out where they're at on this whole subject of Romans 13 and all that, what's your best recommendation for the things that I should say to them?
[02:25:07.088 --> 02:25:10.109]  Well, I'm not familiar with the first question you asked.
[02:25:10.109 --> 02:25:10.809]  Okay.
[02:25:10.809 --> 02:25:21.693]  And the second question, I can tell you frankly and honestly, for years and years, you will not get a straight answer.
[02:25:21.693 --> 02:25:29.556]  If you go to ministers and try to tell them anything about Romans 13, you will not get anywhere.
[02:25:29.556 --> 02:25:31.817]  I found that to be the truth.
[02:25:31.817 --> 02:25:34.318]  Any other suggestion then?
[02:25:34.318 --> 02:25:34.478]  Well,
[02:25:35.516 --> 02:25:50.721]  Um, if you do have somebody that's willing just to sit down and be very polite and courteous and listen to what you say, then my suggestion would be that you just mention to them that the Constitution is the official document, the government of the United States.
[02:25:51.816 --> 02:25:57.637]  And that shouldn't we be following it and not just all of these laws that are being passed that are illegal?
[02:25:57.637 --> 02:25:58.858]  Well, that's right!
[02:25:58.858 --> 02:26:00.278]  And turn it on its head.
[02:26:00.278 --> 02:26:01.398]  They claim Romans 13.
[02:26:01.398 --> 02:26:05.319]  Let's say that that's a right interpretation to lick the boots of government.
[02:26:05.319 --> 02:26:08.720]  Well, then why aren't the people running our government licking the boots of the Constitution?
[02:26:08.720 --> 02:26:10.081]  They're overthrowing it!
[02:26:10.081 --> 02:26:11.481]  They are the rebels!
[02:26:11.481 --> 02:26:12.301]  Pastor?
[02:26:12.301 --> 02:26:13.982]  That's right.
[02:26:13.982 --> 02:26:15.342]  Interesting.
[02:26:15.342 --> 02:26:17.382]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:26:17.382 --> 02:26:18.443]  No, no, go ahead.
[02:26:18.443 --> 02:26:19.843]  Okay, one question for you, Alex.
[02:26:20.718 --> 02:26:28.800]  On this June 3rd to 6th operation checkpoint thing, have you heard any more about it?
[02:26:28.800 --> 02:26:33.181]  No, they just... I mean, fill us in.
[02:26:33.181 --> 02:26:37.002]  It rings a bell, but so much goes on sometimes I can't bring something up.
[02:26:37.002 --> 02:26:38.242]  Okay, I've heard it a couple times.
[02:26:38.242 --> 02:26:47.545]  I don't have any documentation for it, but apparently from June 3rd to the 6th, multi-jurisdictional task force drills all over the United States
[02:26:49.358 --> 02:26:53.121]  Stopping cars and doing all the usual checkpoint stuff.
[02:26:53.121 --> 02:26:57.464]  And I just wanted to make a point on it real fast.
[02:26:57.464 --> 02:27:05.709]  I'd suggest to your listeners to go to dot.gov, search for corridor map for your state, and then look.
[02:27:05.709 --> 02:27:15.196]  Because what you'll see is you'll see the main corridors that go up through your state, and every main highway that intersects those corridors is where the corridors are being established first.
[02:27:15.196 --> 02:27:16.657]  In other words, they're pinch points.
[02:27:17.216 --> 02:27:32.278]  So, if they're going to be doing this, if it's actually in fact true, that they are going to be stopping people for three days and getting us used to worshipping Big Brother, I'm betting that they're going to start, that's where the focus of it's going to be, is at these little corridor checkpoints.
[02:27:32.808 --> 02:27:34.729]  And if it's going to happen, folks, stay off the road.
[02:27:34.729 --> 02:27:36.491]  Okay, let me stop you.
[02:27:36.491 --> 02:27:39.413]  You said Operation Checkpoint, and I thought, have I heard of that?
[02:27:39.413 --> 02:27:46.377]  There are national operations, and there is a national drill that just happened through the 1st through the 8th.
[02:27:46.377 --> 02:27:50.320]  There's two more national FEMA takeover mass roundup drills.
[02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:51.101]  That's admitted.
[02:27:51.101 --> 02:27:52.602]  I mean, I have the news articles.
[02:27:52.602 --> 02:27:57.065]  They're on InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:27:57.065 --> 02:27:59.967]  And so, yes, and they then had
[02:28:01.059 --> 02:28:06.183]  Another operation that was in three states, Tennessee, Arkansas, and one other.
[02:28:06.183 --> 02:28:09.785]  And we wrote articles about that three weeks ago when it happened.
[02:28:09.785 --> 02:28:12.467]  It was Operation Sudden Impact.
[02:28:12.467 --> 02:28:17.091]  And they went in and they admittedly said, quote, fighting terrorists.
[02:28:17.091 --> 02:28:19.573]  And they said, we'll be out fighting terror.
[02:28:19.573 --> 02:28:24.416]  And then they announced, yes, we arrested thousands for no insurance.
[02:28:24.416 --> 02:28:25.897]  We ran huge checkpoints.
[02:28:25.897 --> 02:28:28.019]  They went up to people on the street and searched them.
[02:28:28.659 --> 02:28:32.421]  And it was all under federal control with the military working with them.
[02:28:32.421 --> 02:28:34.222]  So that was called Operation Sudden Impact.
[02:28:34.222 --> 02:28:39.165]  So yes, they are having more drills coming up next month, a month after that.
[02:28:39.165 --> 02:28:40.805]  But they call them drills.
[02:28:40.805 --> 02:28:41.526]  They're real.
[02:28:41.526 --> 02:28:43.267]  They really arrest you.
[02:28:43.267 --> 02:28:47.709]  And yes, it is Nazi Germany slash Russian style.
[02:28:47.709 --> 02:28:48.429]  Just line up.
[02:28:48.429 --> 02:28:49.630]  We're searching you.
[02:28:49.630 --> 02:28:53.452]  Homeland Security said five years ago, life will be like an airport.
[02:28:54.036 --> 02:28:55.317]  You will be searched everywhere.
[02:28:55.317 --> 02:28:56.538]  Arty England does it.
[02:28:56.538 --> 02:28:57.399]  Vans pull up.
[02:28:57.399 --> 02:28:58.400]  They make you walk through them.
[02:28:58.400 --> 02:28:59.521]  They scan you.
[02:28:59.521 --> 02:29:02.984]  They make you thumb scan and drug test you to go in restaurants.
[02:29:02.984 --> 02:29:05.446]  They just suddenly show up and arrest you if you don't.
[02:29:05.446 --> 02:29:07.988]  Just hordes of goons running around.
[02:29:07.988 --> 02:29:09.550]  And Austin was doing it a few weeks ago.
[02:29:09.550 --> 02:29:11.211]  There were cherries everywhere at night.
[02:29:11.211 --> 02:29:13.273]  They were just randomly pulling people over.
[02:29:13.273 --> 02:29:15.815]  Instead of a checkpoint, just random pullovers.
[02:29:15.815 --> 02:29:16.876]  Stay there, David J. Smith.
[02:29:16.876 --> 02:29:18.057]  I want to get your comment on that.
[02:29:18.894 --> 02:29:30.597]  Plug your website, newsgroup, and do one more segment with you if you'll grace us with the time to talk to all the callers that are patiently holding, like Andrew, Steve, Don, and Greg, and many others.
[02:29:30.597 --> 02:29:31.317]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:31.317 --> 02:29:38.038]  Stay with us.
[02:29:38.038 --> 02:29:39.419]  We're on the march.
[02:29:39.419 --> 02:29:41.959]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:41.959 --> 02:29:44.660]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:47.483 --> 02:29:52.825]  The Federal Trade Commission estimates that 9 million Americans are victims of identity theft each year.
[02:29:52.825 --> 02:29:57.707]  The crime of identity theft occurs every 3.5 seconds, costing the victims an average of $8,000.
[02:29:57.707 --> 02:30:05.690]  If you own a PC, passwords are a common form of authentication, and often the only protection between a hacker and your personal information.
[02:30:06.010 --> 02:30:15.012]  Passwords that are stored in a spreadsheet, text file, data file, or any other file that is not encrypted and password protected are vulnerable to malicious theft and misuse.

[02:30:47.946 --> 02:30:49.327]  It is a big idea.
[02:30:49.327 --> 02:30:52.189]  A new world order.
[02:30:52.189 --> 02:30:52.729]  In the near future.
[02:30:53.982 --> 02:30:57.044]  Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:30:57.044 --> 02:30:59.886]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:30:59.886 --> 02:31:02.668]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:31:02.668 --> 02:31:05.850]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:31:05.850 --> 02:31:13.175]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:31:16.212 --> 02:31:21.633]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:31:21.633 --> 02:31:25.534]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:31:25.534 --> 02:31:28.075]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:31:28.075 --> 02:31:29.235]  Most people have no idea.
[02:31:29.235 --> 02:31:30.035]  They're not after money.
[02:31:30.035 --> 02:31:31.295]  They have all the money they need.
[02:31:31.295 --> 02:31:32.296]  They're after power.
[02:31:32.296 --> 02:31:33.436]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[02:31:33.436 --> 02:31:37.617]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[02:31:39.218 --> 02:31:49.309]  Hi, this is Dave from Ready Reserve Foods.
[02:31:49.309 --> 02:31:55.635]  I've been waiting patiently for the government and mainstream media to inform you of what is turning out to be the biggest problem facing the world in the last 50 years.
[02:31:56.656 --> 02:32:02.259]  For the last three years, the Earth has consumed more food than it has been able to produce, and it has now finally caught up with this.
[02:32:02.259 --> 02:32:09.202]  In the U.S., commodities such as flour and rice are already being rationed, and the next rice crop won't be available for another four to five months.
[02:32:09.202 --> 02:32:15.805]  It's fall in the Southern Hemisphere, and many countries are short the food necessary to make it through the winter, and have stopped exporting certain commodities altogether.
[02:32:16.604 --> 02:32:18.185]  Remember our trade deficit?
[02:32:18.185 --> 02:32:24.048]  Trillions of dollars have stacked up outside the country and are now rushing in to buy our food production at any price.
[02:32:24.048 --> 02:32:30.431]  By late summer, if not early fall, it is likely our government will step in and control food and food exports under martial law.
[02:32:30.431 --> 02:32:31.912]  Call Ready Reserve Foods at 1-800-453-2202.
[02:32:31.912 --> 02:32:31.992]  1-800-453-2202.
[02:32:31.992 --> 02:32:33.432]  Or visit us at www.readyreservefoods.com.
[02:32:33.432 --> 02:32:33.492]  1-800-453-2202.
[02:32:55.273 --> 02:32:58.917]  Take a look out your window there, there's a scene you like to catch.
[02:32:58.917 --> 02:33:03.481]  Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you like to catch.
[02:33:03.481 --> 02:33:04.862]  Fendi's playing Dixie.
[02:33:04.862 --> 02:33:08.986]  Fendi's got his hand outstretched.
[02:33:08.986 --> 02:33:11.389]  Could be the viola.
[02:33:11.389 --> 02:33:14.472]  Could be the local priest.
[02:33:14.472 --> 02:33:15.773]  Oh, sometimes.
[02:33:15.773 --> 02:33:19.496]  Well, there's sometimes, sometimes.
[02:33:27.945 --> 02:33:33.608]  We're going to continue with Andrew, Steve, Don, Greg.
[02:33:33.608 --> 02:33:37.290]  We'll at least get to those four calls.
[02:33:50.498 --> 02:33:51.999]  There may be others with David A. Smith.
[02:33:51.999 --> 02:33:53.221]  He'll be with us for the rest of the hour.
[02:33:53.221 --> 02:33:58.726]  The next hour, I'm going to do a huge news blitz, give you an update on some things that have happened to Wayne Madsen.
[02:33:58.726 --> 02:34:04.691]  He is in Houston right now in the middle of an investigation of the murder of a CIA officer down there.
[02:34:04.691 --> 02:34:06.313]  So we'll let you know what's happening there.
[02:34:08.191 --> 02:34:17.797]  But before we go back to Pastor David J. Smith, I want to encourage you to visit InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, but more than that, spread the word!
[02:34:17.797 --> 02:34:27.124]  Tell people about InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and our auxiliary sites like InfoWars.net and JonesReport.com and TruthNews.us.
[02:34:27.124 --> 02:34:31.867]  And financially support us, because we're about to go up to the next level.
[02:34:31.867 --> 02:34:35.209]  We are going to start a lot of new projects, a TV show,
[02:34:36.253 --> 02:34:37.314]  Uh, on cable.
[02:34:37.314 --> 02:34:38.335]  I'm shooting for that.
[02:34:38.335 --> 02:34:40.778]  A lot of other things that we're gonna do.
[02:34:40.778 --> 02:34:42.339]  Because the time is short.
[02:34:42.339 --> 02:34:44.441]  The enemy's moving against humanity.
[02:34:44.441 --> 02:34:45.262]  They're moving fast.
[02:34:45.262 --> 02:34:46.283]  We gotta move fast.
[02:34:46.283 --> 02:34:48.805]  And, I'm gonna plug this next hour.
[02:34:48.805 --> 02:34:52.328]  Like, last Wednesday, when I was going on vacation with my family for three days.
[02:34:52.328 --> 02:34:54.110]  A well-needed one, by the way.
[02:34:54.110 --> 02:34:54.831]  It really refreshed me.
[02:34:55.469 --> 02:34:57.110]  It was a real blessing.
[02:34:57.110 --> 02:35:00.773]  We got an email going, there's an Alex Jones Moneybomb, and I was like, what?
[02:35:00.773 --> 02:35:02.594]  And they were like, well, will you respond?
[02:35:02.594 --> 02:35:04.415]  And I said, oh, when I get back.
[02:35:04.415 --> 02:35:09.118]  So Sunday afternoon, I looked at it, and I'm like, well, who is this?
[02:35:09.118 --> 02:35:16.023]  Then I found out it is the original guy, even before Trevor Lyman got involved, the guy that started the Ron Paul Moneybomb, one of our listeners.
[02:35:16.023 --> 02:35:20.426]  So I needed to tell Trey today, the producer, I forgot to do this, to set him up for the show.
[02:35:22.091 --> 02:35:29.376]  So A, we need to get the guy on the show, and B, so the Money Bomb isn't a failure, I better start promoting it, because it's for May 31st.
[02:35:29.376 --> 02:35:34.199]  And I pledge to you, every cent will be spent on more cameras.
[02:35:34.199 --> 02:35:37.101]  We bought new cameras two years ago, they're already beat up.
[02:35:37.101 --> 02:35:39.863]  Better computers, we could do a lot more if we had more money.
[02:35:39.863 --> 02:35:45.947]  And we're about to move into a bigger office, I've got it down to one or two places, we're looking at the move in the next few months.
[02:35:45.947 --> 02:35:46.988]  And more staff.
[02:35:47.911 --> 02:35:56.654]  And, you know, I guarantee you that your money coming here will be spent in the fight against the New World Order.
[02:35:56.654 --> 02:35:58.495]  100% of Moneybomb proceeds.
[02:35:58.495 --> 02:36:03.256]  I gotta get around to my wife, because we're such a big operation, setting up a PayPal for that.
[02:36:03.256 --> 02:36:11.559]  Because I don't want to use our other PayPal for it, because it'd get mixed up with the orders, video and book orders, and PrisonPlanet.tv subscriptions.
[02:36:11.559 --> 02:36:13.860]  But yeah, it's please help us spread the Moneybomb.
[02:36:13.860 --> 02:36:16.461]  I need Kurt Nimmo to do a story on it, Paul Watson to do a story on it.
[02:36:17.301 --> 02:36:23.363]  And I want them to go off, you know, basically the gist and ideas I have next hour when I spend five minutes on that.
[02:36:23.363 --> 02:36:24.723]  So, stand by everybody.
[02:36:24.723 --> 02:36:26.144]  That's something big we're doing.
[02:36:26.144 --> 02:36:28.885]  Also, what makes this show possible is our sponsors.
[02:36:28.885 --> 02:36:30.865]  People like eFoods Direct.
[02:36:30.865 --> 02:36:34.206]  They are the longest continually operating storable foods company in the nation.
[02:36:34.206 --> 02:36:34.847]  27 years.
[02:36:34.847 --> 02:36:37.427]  I've gotten storable foods from them four times.
[02:36:37.427 --> 02:36:38.268]  And I store it.
[02:36:38.268 --> 02:36:39.148]  I give it to family.
[02:36:39.148 --> 02:36:40.789]  I stockpile it.
[02:36:40.789 --> 02:36:42.169]  It's freeze-dried and dehydrated.
[02:36:42.169 --> 02:36:44.230]  Fits in very small areas.
[02:36:44.230 --> 02:36:45.230]  So, it's very compact.
[02:36:46.277 --> 02:36:49.679]  With the economy, with all that's happening.
[02:36:49.679 --> 02:36:52.400]  It's good, clean, non-GMO food.
[02:36:52.400 --> 02:36:55.482]  With all the things that are going on, it just makes sense to be prepared.
[02:36:55.482 --> 02:37:00.024]  It just makes sense to have storable foods, and these are great folks that I trust and believe in.
[02:37:00.024 --> 02:37:03.125]  1-800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com, big banners at the top of infowars.com, and prisonplanet.com, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:37:15.035 --> 02:37:19.458]  And we also have another great sponsor, and that's Aloes.
[02:37:19.458 --> 02:37:22.199]  Those are the folks from New Vitality.
[02:37:22.199 --> 02:37:32.065]  There's a banner on Infowars.com, a list of all of our sponsors that is on there, but you can see a banner to New Vitality, link through for their hundreds of great products.
[02:37:32.065 --> 02:37:43.011]  No magical cures, just a mainline, high-quality supplement and vitamin and nutrient and wellness organization that has the well-known things that are good for your body and well-known treatments for things.
[02:37:43.391 --> 02:37:47.032]  And one of the products that I've used is Aloe Ease Body Cleanse.
[02:37:47.032 --> 02:37:51.114]  Your guts are where most of the toxins are secreted, and you need to flush that out.
[02:37:51.114 --> 02:37:53.694]  Aloe Vera and these other herbs in this pill do that.
[02:37:53.694 --> 02:37:54.255]  1-800-569-4056.
[02:37:54.255 --> 02:37:54.475]  1-800-569-4056.
[02:37:54.475 --> 02:38:01.557]  Men above 40 have a lot of prostate problems.
[02:38:01.557 --> 02:38:05.458]  They've got a combination of well-known herbs to shrink the prostate, make it healthier.
[02:38:05.458 --> 02:38:05.518]  1-800-569-4056.
[02:38:08.439 --> 02:38:11.460]  Or go to their banner on InfoWars.com, New Vitality.
[02:38:11.460 --> 02:38:16.041]  Okay, let's go back to Pastor David J. Smith and more calls.
[02:38:16.041 --> 02:38:24.943]  Pastor, commenting on what Dave in California was saying briefly, checkpoints, random martial law drills.
[02:38:24.943 --> 02:38:31.404]  I mean, they admit that they're randomly coming up and shaking people down, totally twisting our police.
[02:38:32.705 --> 02:38:38.769]  Well, there's ten basic steps to would-be dictators taking over a country.
[02:38:38.769 --> 02:38:46.833]  And one of them is to have their paramilitary, and they go into the streets and do exactly what they're doing here in America.
[02:38:46.833 --> 02:38:48.294]  This is what Hitler did.
[02:38:48.294 --> 02:38:49.835]  This is what Mussolini did.
[02:38:49.835 --> 02:38:54.198]  This is what dictators like Chavez have done down in South America.
[02:38:54.198 --> 02:38:57.940]  And so, you can expect it, because they're on the verge.
[02:38:58.956 --> 02:38:59.216]  Absolutely.
[02:38:59.216 --> 02:39:02.417]  They know without a doubt that there's going to be an uprising in this country
[02:39:16.215 --> 02:39:18.396]  What do you want to say to police officers out there, Pastor?
[02:39:18.396 --> 02:39:21.177]  I mean, you're a well-known, nationally televised pastor.
[02:39:21.177 --> 02:39:22.598]  You've been a pastor for 30-plus years.
[02:39:40.059 --> 02:39:44.682]  You are highly respected just south of Dallas there, a very large church there.
[02:39:44.682 --> 02:39:49.785]  I mean, you're a mainline guy who predicted all this 20, 30 years ago.
[02:39:49.785 --> 02:39:50.886]  It's now happening.
[02:39:50.886 --> 02:39:53.528]  They've got some decisions to make, don't they?
[02:39:53.528 --> 02:39:54.588]  They do.
[02:39:54.588 --> 02:40:06.856]  And here's something that the American people don't know that is happening, but they're going in and they're getting special ops people out of the military and coming into the police departments.
[02:40:07.808 --> 02:40:10.210]  And so these are very tough people.
[02:40:10.210 --> 02:40:18.858]  While they're taught certain manners, if you say one thing out of line that they don't like, they can take you down.
[02:40:18.858 --> 02:40:24.683]  And so I would just say to the police that are listening, read your Constitution.
[02:40:24.683 --> 02:40:34.011]  98% in the Congress, House, and the Senate have never read their Constitution.
[02:40:34.011 --> 02:40:34.652]  And that's why
[02:40:35.572 --> 02:40:39.456]  The nation is in the problem, but it's in.
[02:40:39.456 --> 02:40:43.901]  But if you'll read your Constitution and you'll know the rights which people have
[02:40:44.631 --> 02:40:46.572]  Then you won't violate them.
[02:40:46.572 --> 02:40:54.678]  Just because you wear a badge does not give you the authority to run over people in a Republican form of government.
[02:40:54.678 --> 02:41:10.067]  Well, I mean, how can officers listening not know the government's bad when we have them on video saying the Bill of Rights is bad, anybody that talks about it's a terrorist, and training manuals, and I mean, obviously that's the bad guys, obviously the government's bad.
[02:41:10.067 --> 02:41:12.249]  Well, I agree with that.
[02:41:12.249 --> 02:41:13.850]  But look at Blackwater USA.
[02:41:14.699 --> 02:41:17.160]  They went into New Orleans.
[02:41:17.160 --> 02:41:24.422]  I mean, our government had to pay them millions of dollars, up to $53 million, to go in and patrol the streets.
[02:41:24.422 --> 02:41:30.084]  They're the ones that stopped the water and the food getting into the people as fast as it should have been.
[02:41:30.084 --> 02:41:34.986]  They're the ones who are hiring CIA agents that double the pay.
[02:41:34.986 --> 02:41:41.268]  They're hiring Navy SEALs, Special Ops people at 12 times the pay if they were in our military.
[02:41:41.966 --> 02:41:43.627]  To be in a private army.
[02:41:43.627 --> 02:41:43.927]  That's right.
[02:41:43.927 --> 02:41:43.987]  Yep.
[02:42:01.195 --> 02:42:05.416]  I mean, people say it's so incredible that I can't be bought or you can't be bought.
[02:42:05.416 --> 02:42:07.176]  I don't even have a choice.
[02:42:07.176 --> 02:42:08.656]  I mean, it burns in my bones.
[02:42:08.656 --> 02:42:12.077]  Like Ezekiel said, I couldn't sell out.
[02:42:12.077 --> 02:42:14.037]  I mean, money means nothing to me.
[02:42:14.037 --> 02:42:15.858]  All it is is fuel to fight evil.
[02:42:15.858 --> 02:42:19.658]  What matters is what I believe and what I stand up for and who I am.
[02:42:19.658 --> 02:42:23.119]  And to me, that's not even exceptional, Pastor Smith.
[02:42:23.119 --> 02:42:28.280]  I don't understand how people will just do anything for money, and it's all an illusion of a magician.
[02:42:28.280 --> 02:42:29.900]  It's all fiat that the bankers made.
[02:42:31.038 --> 02:42:36.620]  Well, they think they're going to be the top personnel in this New World Order.
[02:42:36.620 --> 02:42:41.482]  And so, they're willing to sell themselves out.
[02:42:41.482 --> 02:42:44.344]  But it's not going to be that way at all.
[02:42:44.344 --> 02:42:50.186]  Even our congressmen, they're not going to be in the top echelon of the New World Order.
[02:42:50.186 --> 02:42:59.490]  Many of them, just like the communists said years ago, they can't wait for the day that they can cut their throats and sing about the blood all over the Congress.
[02:43:00.034 --> 02:43:02.135]  Well, that's it.
[02:43:02.135 --> 02:43:18.522]  Whether it's Hitler, Stalin, it doesn't matter what type of regime, if it's authoritarian, they always wipe out and imprison and kill the guys that brought them to power because they know where the bodies are buried and they like to punish them and blame the purges on the people on them.
[02:43:18.522 --> 02:43:22.984]  And they also know that they're the traitors that opened the drawbridge.
[02:43:22.984 --> 02:43:24.425]  And so they don't trust them.
[02:43:25.771 --> 02:43:26.471]  That's right.
[02:43:26.471 --> 02:43:30.012]  And you look at every dictatorship that has risen.
[02:43:30.012 --> 02:43:30.932]  Lenin did it.
[02:43:30.932 --> 02:43:32.232]  Stalin did it.
[02:43:32.232 --> 02:43:33.932]  Every single one of them.
[02:43:33.932 --> 02:43:36.973]  They eliminated the competition.
[02:43:36.973 --> 02:43:37.753]  Yeah, that's it.
[02:43:37.753 --> 02:43:38.853]  It's also the competition.
[02:43:38.853 --> 02:43:42.054]  They're afraid that these guys will come up under them.
[02:43:42.054 --> 02:43:42.834]  Mm-hmm.
[02:43:42.834 --> 02:43:50.895]  And so they actually do normally wipe them out and then try to hire, quote, better people who are more, quote, moral, who will just carry out their operations.
[02:43:50.895 --> 02:43:51.495]  Yeah.
[02:43:51.495 --> 02:43:52.856]  Oh, they have no idea what's in store for them.
[02:43:52.856 --> 02:43:53.656]  Let's take a call.
[02:43:53.656 --> 02:43:55.176]  Andrew in Oklahoma, thanks for holding.
[02:43:56.158 --> 02:43:56.839]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:43:56.839 --> 02:43:58.560]  Thanks, Pastor Smith.
[02:43:58.560 --> 02:44:08.527]  In fact, I interviewed Pastor Smith back in 1999 for the Waxahachie Daily Light when I was a reporter there, and my editor never ran the story.
[02:44:08.527 --> 02:44:15.732]  But anyway, I wanted to find out from both of you your thoughts on Bush and Cheney once their time is up.
[02:44:17.641 --> 02:44:22.445]  Uh, is Bush just going to return to Crawford, Texas and just completely retire?
[02:44:22.445 --> 02:44:24.726]  No, he is selling that movie stage.
[02:44:24.726 --> 02:44:26.147]  That's up for sale.
[02:44:26.147 --> 02:44:27.148]  He doesn't ride horses.
[02:44:27.148 --> 02:44:28.529]  He's not from Texas.
[02:44:28.529 --> 02:44:30.531]  I'm not knocking folks from Kennebunkport.
[02:44:30.531 --> 02:44:32.152]  I don't like getting the blame for him.
[02:44:32.925 --> 02:44:35.425]  And, uh, Cheney's moving to Dubai.
[02:44:35.425 --> 02:44:38.266]  Bush has got a place in Dubai and Ecuador.
[02:44:38.266 --> 02:44:40.206]  And, uh, so everything's going to Dubai.
[02:44:40.206 --> 02:44:42.887]  I've had some Dubai Arabs on YouTube attacking me now.
[02:44:42.887 --> 02:44:44.447]  They love the New World Order.
[02:44:44.447 --> 02:44:45.687]  The Saudis are big in it.
[02:44:45.687 --> 02:44:48.228]  And, uh, no, they're all leaving the country.
[02:44:48.228 --> 02:44:51.008]  Uh, in fact, most of the elite have already left the country.
[02:44:51.008 --> 02:44:53.529]  David J. Smith comments on that.
[02:44:53.529 --> 02:45:00.170]  Well, they're gonna leave the country because they know the United States is going to be, um, turned over to the military.
[02:45:01.095 --> 02:45:18.351]  They're going to allow Muslims to come in with their nuclear bombs, which they've gotten from Russia and other sources, and so they're going to try to take out America, and these elite have to be out of the country.
[02:45:18.351 --> 02:45:19.352]  That's right.
[02:45:19.352 --> 02:45:27.399]  Folks, I know people worth billions of dollars, okay, and I know other technocrats who represent billionaires, and I'm telling you, for four years,
[02:45:28.683 --> 02:45:34.608]  It's the equivalent of hanging off the helicopter skids in 75 in Saigon during the evacuation.
[02:45:34.608 --> 02:45:35.689]  You ever seen them on top of the U.S.
[02:45:35.689 --> 02:45:37.570]  Embassy hanging on helicopter skids?
[02:45:37.570 --> 02:45:38.871]  They are running.
[02:45:38.871 --> 02:45:43.835]  They are Cook Islands, Costa Rica, Australia, New Zealand,
[02:45:44.375 --> 02:45:45.855]  Hollywood is all running.
[02:45:45.855 --> 02:45:47.216]  I mean, it is.
[02:45:47.216 --> 02:45:50.576]  And their words are, quote, there won't be an America.
[02:45:50.576 --> 02:45:52.497]  Now, I'm not saying that's going to happen.
[02:45:52.497 --> 02:45:58.378]  I'm just saying they have set something up so horrible for us that they're leaving.
[02:45:58.378 --> 02:46:00.278]  Pastor, comments?
[02:46:00.278 --> 02:46:09.380]  Well, they're going to be leaving because they know that America is a Christian nation down deep, basically.
[02:46:10.283 --> 02:46:20.547]  And there were surveys made two years ago that still said that 84% of Americans believed in God and Jesus Christ, and they were nominal Christians.
[02:46:20.547 --> 02:46:28.690]  Now, if you have Lucifer as the head of a New World Order, now who are you going to try to exterminate?
[02:46:28.690 --> 02:46:30.951]  The name of Jesus Christ.
[02:46:30.951 --> 02:46:34.492]  Where is it being preached from more than any other place in the world?
[02:46:34.492 --> 02:46:37.033]  The United States, and at one time, Great Britain.
[02:46:38.740 --> 02:46:44.243]  But today it's the United States, so it's got, that name has to be wiped off the face of the earth.
[02:46:44.243 --> 02:46:48.666]  And again, folks, even if you don't believe in Christianity, the elites do.
[02:46:48.666 --> 02:46:56.911]  They say Christianity is their enemy, and I don't mean the fake Christianity you see on, you know, the TBN shows.
[02:46:56.911 --> 02:46:58.732]  Okay, caller, I appreciate your call.
[02:46:58.732 --> 02:47:00.193]  Let's talk to Steve in Colorado.
[02:47:00.193 --> 02:47:02.194]  Steve, you're on the air.
[02:47:02.194 --> 02:47:04.155]  Hello, Alex and David.
[02:47:05.325 --> 02:47:17.169]  First of all, I just wanted to recognize that this May 14th, today is the 60th anniversary of the State of Israel, and so that is a fulfillment of prophecy from the Old Testament.
[02:47:17.169 --> 02:47:22.992]  And then I had three other quick points, and I will make them quick, Alex, because I know you've got cars waiting.
[02:47:22.992 --> 02:47:23.752]  The second point is,
[02:47:25.465 --> 02:47:30.448]  Albert Pike, in Morals and Dogma, wrote that Lucifer is God.
[02:47:30.448 --> 02:47:41.393]  So, Masons, and of course most Masons don't understand this, because like you had mentioned earlier, David, they're not told the true nature of the organization until they get up to about the 33rd degree.
[02:47:41.393 --> 02:47:43.093]  Yeah, they're despised.
[02:47:43.093 --> 02:47:48.696]  They're called porch Masons, and the upper Masons laugh at them and just hate their guts.
[02:47:48.696 --> 02:47:53.398]  Right, but Albert Pike actually wrote, and unfortunately I don't have a page number,
[02:47:53.738 --> 02:48:03.006]  But he actually wrote in Morals and Dogma that Lucifer is God and that Adonai is nothing, which is Adonai, the God of the Jews.
[02:48:03.006 --> 02:48:03.706]  Right.
[02:48:03.706 --> 02:48:10.552]  And then the next thing is, you were mentioning about the Jesuits and the Knights of Malta.
[02:48:10.552 --> 02:48:19.820]  I would also tend to think that Opus Dei, which is Latin for The Work of God, is probably also in there with the Jesuits and Knights of Malta.
[02:48:20.632 --> 02:48:25.756]  And then the final thing that I wanted to mention, and I have one quick question for you also.
[02:48:25.756 --> 02:48:30.360]  The worst thing about the Roman Catholic Church is that they teach a false salvation.
[02:48:30.360 --> 02:48:38.286]  They teach supposed salvation by faith and works, but true salvation is by faith alone in what Jesus Christ did.
[02:48:38.286 --> 02:48:40.187]  No works associated with it at all.
[02:48:40.187 --> 02:48:43.470]  But if you have salvation, aren't you going to have the fruits of the works?
[02:48:43.470 --> 02:48:46.893]  I mean, I don't agree that it's works, but what I'm saying is... That is right.
[02:48:46.893 --> 02:48:49.655]  ...is that I see all these fake Protestant preachers going,
[02:48:50.255 --> 02:49:02.826]  Hey, don't have any guilt, don't be involved, don't be involved in your community, just come here, drive Cadillacs, feel good, I'll dance around in a fancy suit like a little pimp preacher and tell you everything's fine, and worship the government.
[02:49:02.826 --> 02:49:04.727]  Pastor, can you speak to that?
[02:49:04.727 --> 02:49:06.549]  Absolutely.
[02:49:06.549 --> 02:49:17.298]  When you accept Jesus Christ and you have your sins forgiven, from that day forward you obey his law to prevent you from becoming a sinner again, and that's not works.
[02:49:17.298 --> 02:49:18.839]  That's just doing what you should do.
[02:49:20.146 --> 02:49:28.928]  But there's these people that do no works, and they say, hey, I've got the justification, it's done, and then I'm going to go to the topless bar right now.
[02:49:28.928 --> 02:49:29.188]  Right.
[02:49:29.188 --> 02:49:34.189]  James 2 says, faith without works is dead.
[02:49:34.189 --> 02:49:34.869]  Faith.
[02:49:34.869 --> 02:49:45.351]  Yes, you have faith in the saving power of Jesus Christ and His shed blood, but then you obey His commandments to prevent you from being a sinner all over again.
[02:49:45.351 --> 02:49:48.992]  Now, do the Calvinists really believe that once you're saved you can never go back?
[02:49:50.385 --> 02:49:51.806]  Yes, I know some do.
[02:49:51.806 --> 02:49:53.207]  I don't know which ones.
[02:49:53.207 --> 02:49:54.268]  Do you agree with that?
[02:49:54.268 --> 02:49:56.310]  Oh, absolutely not.
[02:49:56.310 --> 02:50:00.974]  Because, I mean, I've read so many things in the Bible where people were with God and then left.
[02:50:00.974 --> 02:50:01.534]  Right.
[02:50:01.534 --> 02:50:04.136]  Hebrews 4, 4-6 says it.
[02:50:04.136 --> 02:50:10.361]  That if you go back into the world, then you are trampling on the shed blood of Jesus Christ again.
[02:50:10.361 --> 02:50:15.105]  And then in Hebrews chapter 10, it says the same thing, down and around about verse 27 and 28.
[02:50:17.606 --> 02:50:26.311]  And so there's many places in the Bible that says once you put your hand to the plow and you go forward and you truly understand, then you don't go backwards.
[02:50:26.311 --> 02:50:32.375]  Isn't it the ultimate sin to know God but then willfully harden your heart?
[02:50:32.375 --> 02:50:33.835]  Absolutely.
[02:50:33.835 --> 02:50:36.377]  Yeah, so how could you know God but then harden your heart?
[02:50:36.377 --> 02:50:38.058]  That means turning to evil.
[02:50:38.058 --> 02:50:38.718]  Deciding.
[02:50:38.718 --> 02:50:43.301]  Alright, we'll be right back with a few final phone calls for Pastor David J. Smith.

[02:51:35.866 --> 02:51:35.926]  239-628-3708.
[02:51:35.926 --> 02:51:36.447]  It is a big idea.
[02:51:36.447 --> 02:51:37.127]  A new world order.
[02:51:37.127 --> 02:51:39.309]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:51:57.099 --> 02:51:59.922]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:51:59.922 --> 02:52:02.704]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:52:02.704 --> 02:52:05.888]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:52:05.888 --> 02:52:13.215]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:52:16.237 --> 02:52:21.681]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:52:21.681 --> 02:52:25.063]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:52:45.657 --> 02:52:46.157]  I'm warned.
[02:53:02.952 --> 02:53:06.194]  Many people say that it gives them a whole new outlook on life.
[02:53:06.194 --> 02:53:09.636]  Ask someone who wears one, or better yet, try one for yourself.
[02:53:09.636 --> 02:53:13.738]  The silver band with gold terminals is still the most popular and a bestseller.
[02:53:13.738 --> 02:53:20.602]  The balance bracelet has no magnets, but is ionized in such a way that wearers are so delighted they refuse to ever take theirs off.

[02:53:44.528 --> 02:53:46.088]  Offer not available in California.
[02:53:49.853 --> 02:53:51.395]  All right, we got to move fast for five minutes.
[02:53:51.395 --> 02:53:53.877]  We got left with Pastor David J. Smith.
[02:53:53.877 --> 02:53:56.200]  Fire out his phone number and website here in just a moment.
[02:53:56.200 --> 02:54:01.185]  Tell you when you can watch him on international satellite television.
[02:54:01.185 --> 02:54:02.146]  Look, I'm skipping ahead.
[02:54:02.146 --> 02:54:05.149]  I'm guessing this is John from Ohio, who's like a communist.
[02:54:06.272 --> 02:54:08.614]  We don't screen calls, but I know there's a John in Ohio that calls.
[02:54:08.614 --> 02:54:17.182]  I'm going to skip ahead of Don and Greg, but John, I'm going to go to you really fast, because I'm guessing you're the communist and you disagree with Pastor David J. Smith.
[02:54:17.182 --> 02:54:18.623]  No, I'm not a communist.
[02:54:18.623 --> 02:54:19.924]  Okay, let me stop you.
[02:54:19.924 --> 02:54:22.507]  You're not the normal John from Ohio, so I apologize.
[02:54:22.507 --> 02:54:23.668]  Go ahead and ask your question.
[02:54:23.668 --> 02:54:30.654]  No, my sister introduced me to your show when she gave me the Bohemian Grove tape, and I'm fully sold on what all y'all are saying.
[02:54:30.954 --> 02:54:31.815]  Well, no, it's not that.
[02:54:31.815 --> 02:54:33.296]  You're allowed to disagree, too.
[02:54:33.296 --> 02:54:34.577]  John has called... No, I don't agree.
[02:54:34.577 --> 02:54:35.458]  Pastor, let me stop you.
[02:54:35.458 --> 02:54:36.178]  Let me stop you.
[02:54:36.178 --> 02:54:42.163]  John has called, and Pastor David J. Smith hasn't been on and attacked him, so that's why I thought it was John.
[02:54:42.163 --> 02:54:43.024]  Go ahead.
[02:54:43.024 --> 02:54:43.724]  Okay.
[02:54:43.724 --> 02:54:46.346]  No, I agree with everything... No, no, you're a separate John.
[02:54:46.346 --> 02:54:47.807]  John's a... Okay, go ahead.
[02:54:47.807 --> 02:54:49.208]  Yeah, I agree with everything you're saying.
[02:54:49.208 --> 02:54:51.030]  My sister introduced me to your show.
[02:54:51.030 --> 02:54:51.991]  I'm sold.
[02:54:51.991 --> 02:54:54.312]  I got time off to listen to you today.
[02:54:54.312 --> 02:54:58.456]  I want to ask the pastor, has he seen the Clinton Chronicles, and could he...
[02:54:59.560 --> 02:55:06.486]  Be briefly again about what he was saying about that letter from Kenya from where Obama's people was from again, then I'll get off the air.
[02:55:06.486 --> 02:55:07.027]  Thank you, sir.
[02:55:07.027 --> 02:55:08.929]  God bless you for listening.
[02:55:08.929 --> 02:55:13.293]  I have heard of the Clinton Chronicles, but I have not personally seen them yet.
[02:55:13.293 --> 02:55:13.853]  It's excellent.
[02:55:13.853 --> 02:55:14.333]  I've seen it.
[02:55:14.333 --> 02:55:15.515]  Larry Nichols did it.
[02:55:15.515 --> 02:55:17.556]  Yes, and I know Larry Nichols.
[02:55:17.556 --> 02:55:25.764]  I did an interview with him many years ago about the email from Kenya.
[02:55:27.182 --> 02:55:31.445]  It just basically said, America, don't be fooled.
[02:55:31.445 --> 02:55:36.288]  That Mr. Obama is a racist, and he's even put out a little booklet.
[02:55:36.288 --> 02:55:39.871]  Um, and I found it on the internet.
[02:55:39.871 --> 02:55:45.154]  It's something to do with his father, I forgot the exact title of it right now.
[02:55:45.154 --> 02:55:52.099]  But, um, where he's racist, and it said that he is a secret Islamic.
[02:55:52.099 --> 02:55:54.561]  So, we'll have to wait and see.
[02:55:56.195 --> 02:56:03.201]  Well, we know there's a big Masonic connection to the Muslims, and I'm not attacking Muslims here, but Muslims, your Koran says don't worship idols.
[02:56:03.201 --> 02:56:05.423]  What are those things on top of your buildings?
[02:56:05.423 --> 02:56:10.887]  Again, we've got to have you back up, Pastor David J. Smith.
[02:56:10.887 --> 02:56:14.951]  Fire out your website and toll-free number for folks.
[02:56:14.951 --> 02:56:16.792]  Okay, our toll-free number is 1-800-516-8736.
[02:56:23.776 --> 02:56:33.338]  And anybody that's listening that has not called before, just call and say you listen to the Alex Jones Show, and we'll give you a free year subscription.
[02:56:33.338 --> 02:56:42.099]  Our website is Newswatch Magazine, www.newswatchmagazine.org.
[02:56:42.099 --> 02:56:44.860]  Okay, Don in Texas, you're on the air with David J. Smith.
[02:56:44.860 --> 02:56:45.440]  Oh, hi there.
[02:56:45.440 --> 02:56:50.581]  Yeah, I've enjoyed listening to Pastor Smith many, many years.
[02:56:52.119 --> 02:56:55.760]  I was going to talk about the attack on the people in Colorado City.
[02:56:55.760 --> 02:56:57.021]  Was it the Mormon?
[02:56:57.021 --> 02:56:59.541]  They call them the Mormon Polygamist Group?
[02:56:59.541 --> 02:57:00.722]  Yes.
[02:57:00.722 --> 02:57:08.204]  I don't know that they ever said that they were polygamists or had a big sign out in front of their property, which is a beautiful place.
[02:57:08.743 --> 02:57:11.244]  Well, now they're going to raid someplace in Texas.
[02:57:11.244 --> 02:57:16.027]  This is about the government grandstanding to train you to violate people's due process.
[02:57:16.027 --> 02:57:18.909]  I don't agree with polygamy, and these groups do seem weird.
[02:57:18.909 --> 02:57:22.871]  My point is, the greater evil is a roving government with army tanks.
[02:57:22.871 --> 02:57:24.712]  They wasn't just APCs.
[02:57:24.712 --> 02:57:27.194]  David J. Smith comments on that.
[02:57:27.194 --> 02:57:29.035]  Well, let's face it.
[02:57:29.035 --> 02:57:33.777]  Just like Waco, just like Ruby Ridge, it's all going to come down.
[02:57:33.777 --> 02:57:37.900]  They're going to take a fringe group and come up with an excuse.
[02:57:39.145 --> 02:57:48.179]  And then they're going to attack them, they're going to separate homes, and this is just the precursor that all Christians in America...
[02:57:50.675 --> 02:57:53.096]  Well, they've announced a bunch of other people they want to raid now.
[02:57:53.096 --> 02:57:53.476]  That's it.
[02:57:53.476 --> 02:57:56.317]  They always set the precedent with an easy target first.
[02:57:56.317 --> 02:57:56.817]  That's right.
[02:57:56.817 --> 02:58:00.198]  Like, oh, we're only taking the Nazis' free speech, and then it's everybody's.
[02:58:00.198 --> 02:58:00.878]  That's right.
[02:58:00.878 --> 02:58:01.719]  You know what, David A. Smith?
[02:58:01.719 --> 02:58:07.401]  I've twisted your arm to stay five more minutes because I want to be fair and take a few final calls.
[02:58:07.401 --> 02:58:10.382]  We've only got a five-minute segment back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:10.382 --> 02:58:13.643]  We're going to start the fourth hour in 70 seconds.
[02:58:13.643 --> 02:58:14.043]  Come back.
[02:58:14.723 --> 02:58:18.748]  And let Don finish up and then talk to Greg.
[02:58:18.748 --> 02:58:21.170]  Then that'll be it with Pastor David J. Smith.
[02:58:21.170 --> 02:58:23.893]  And I got a bunch of other news I'm going to be covering.
[02:58:23.893 --> 02:58:25.615]  Huge news blitz coming up.
[02:58:25.615 --> 02:58:30.120]  Stay with us.
[02:58:30.120 --> 02:58:32.602]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:39.928 --> 02:58:43.550]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:58:43.550 --> 02:58:45.892]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:58:45.892 --> 02:58:49.033]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:58:49.033 --> 02:58:54.777]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:58:54.777 --> 02:58:58.679]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[02:59:36.094 --> 02:59:40.695]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:59:40.695 --> 02:59:43.076]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:43.076 --> 02:59:45.857]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:59:57.902 --> 03:00:00.283]  Okay, we're now into the new fourth hour.
[03:00:00.283 --> 03:00:01.324]  We've been doing it for the last month.
[03:00:01.324 --> 03:00:02.544]  A lot of affiliates picking up the show.
[03:00:02.544 --> 03:00:03.745]  We really appreciate that.
[03:00:03.745 --> 03:00:12.349]  I want to take one or two final calls for Pastor David J. Smith and plug his national television program before he leaves us.
[03:00:12.349 --> 03:00:13.690]  Pastor, let's do that now.
[03:00:13.690 --> 03:00:22.134]  One more time, the website, the free magazine, your subscription offer, and when people can tune in and see your national television transmission.
[03:00:22.134 --> 03:00:25.016]  Okay, now the TV show is on DirecTV.
[03:00:25.016 --> 03:00:26.456]  You have to have a dish.
[03:00:26.456 --> 03:00:26.997]  DirecTV.
[03:00:28.135 --> 03:00:42.307]  It's on channel 367, Eastern Time, it's at midnight, Monday night, Tuesday night, Wednesday night, 11 p.m., Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday in the Central Time Zone.
[03:00:42.307 --> 03:00:44.549]  And so in California, that'd be 9 p.m.
[03:00:44.549 --> 03:00:46.211]  Pacific.
[03:00:46.211 --> 03:00:47.672]  That's correct.
[03:00:47.672 --> 03:00:49.013]  And our toll-free number is 1-800.
[03:00:52.457 --> 03:00:54.739]  516-8736.
[03:00:54.739 --> 03:01:00.864]  And you have a free offer of a year's subscription of News Watch Magazine, now in its 28th year of publishing.
[03:01:00.864 --> 03:01:04.828]  Let's go ahead and take a few quick calls here.
[03:01:04.828 --> 03:01:07.931]  Greg in New Jersey, thanks for holding in on the year with Pastor David J. Smith.
[03:01:08.491 --> 03:01:09.451]  Excellent show, gentlemen.
[03:01:09.451 --> 03:01:10.432]  I really appreciate it.
[03:01:10.432 --> 03:01:12.213]  I learned a lot today.
[03:01:12.213 --> 03:01:22.756]  One thing that I've been called is a racist because in New Jersey, they had a Mexican consulate on wheels literally come through Ocean, Monmouth, Middlesex County.
[03:01:22.756 --> 03:01:30.579]  Yeah, handing out fake IDs to everybody, but then the police throw the book at you for not having a driver's license, but the illegals are above the law, allowed to drink and drive.
[03:01:30.579 --> 03:01:33.220]  That's because they're part of taking over for the North American Union.
[03:01:33.220 --> 03:01:35.421]  Again, we're not bashing those people.
[03:01:35.421 --> 03:01:37.242]  The point is they're a weapon, a tool.
[03:01:37.242 --> 03:01:37.542]  Go ahead.
[03:01:38.083 --> 03:01:39.225]  It's even better than that.
[03:01:39.225 --> 03:01:44.677]  They even had representatives from Bank of America there, signing up people for accounts.
[03:01:44.677 --> 03:01:46.080]  Now, correct me if I'm wrong,
[03:01:46.542 --> 03:01:48.443]  I mean, I understand.
[03:01:48.443 --> 03:01:57.145]  If there was something going on in America, and something terrible was happening in America, and Canada was the only place to go, maybe, you know, I could see something like that happening.
[03:01:57.145 --> 03:01:57.926]  Well, let me be clear here.
[03:01:57.926 --> 03:02:05.028]  Wells Fargo and Bank of America, they both accept, with a consular matricula, and give them bank account.
[03:02:05.028 --> 03:02:07.409]  A citizen has to have three forms of ID.
[03:02:07.409 --> 03:02:09.629]  And we've got it in protest at Bank of America.
[03:02:09.629 --> 03:02:11.390]  Let me get a comment from David J. Smith on this.
[03:02:12.495 --> 03:02:27.389]  Well, it's obvious that they're going right along with President Bush and Foxes and British Prime Minister Martin's program, and they want to have a United States of North America, you might say.
[03:02:27.389 --> 03:02:29.451]  The three nations, one economy.
[03:02:29.451 --> 03:02:36.317]  So they're going to try to give them their own bank accounts, open it for them, because they see nothing but money.
[03:02:36.317 --> 03:02:38.039]  Once again, this is the greed
[03:02:38.937 --> 03:02:42.861]  Of what's going on in America, and basically the whole world.
[03:02:42.861 --> 03:02:52.950]  And two years ago, Bank of America admitted in an AP article that quote, oh there's pressure to kick these poor people out, so yeah we're bending the rules to help them.
[03:02:52.950 --> 03:02:57.234]  No, this is an agenda to balkanize and drive down wages in this country.
[03:02:57.234 --> 03:02:57.735]  That's right.
[03:02:58.493 --> 03:03:01.056]  Anything else you want to add there, Greg?
[03:03:01.056 --> 03:03:16.553]  Well, the thing that just troubles me is the fact that if you bring up the fact that, you know, if you're a law-abiding citizen of the United States, and then you point out the flagrant violations of federal, local, and other laws, you know, by people who don't even belong here, somehow you're labeled a racist.
[03:03:16.553 --> 03:03:18.776]  It's like, no, I stand for the rule of law.
[03:03:19.236 --> 03:03:25.641]  Also, we have the Catholic Church running around with their diocese pushing for legalization, and I think that's wrong.
[03:03:25.641 --> 03:03:27.722]  That goes back to what Pastor Smith was saying.
[03:03:27.722 --> 03:03:29.684]  Does that tie into this?
[03:03:29.684 --> 03:03:30.404]  Absolutely.
[03:03:30.404 --> 03:03:31.765]  It does.
[03:03:31.765 --> 03:03:40.391]  Even the Pope, when he came here, he chastised America and said we should have more compassion upon these illegal aliens coming into our country.
[03:03:40.391 --> 03:03:44.274]  But the truth is, they don't want to keep them down there, so they force a good revolution.
[03:03:44.274 --> 03:03:45.335]  They're using the U.S.
[03:03:45.335 --> 03:03:46.135]  as a steam valve.
[03:03:48.439 --> 03:03:49.000]  Absolutely.
[03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:51.582]  Well, thank you so much for that call, Greg.
[03:03:51.582 --> 03:03:52.923]  Anything else?
[03:03:52.923 --> 03:04:00.430]  No, I'm really glad to be a member of your subscription service.
[03:04:00.430 --> 03:04:02.592]  I learn a lot, and thank you very much.
[03:04:02.592 --> 03:04:03.673]  Thank you, Wilfred.
[03:04:03.673 --> 03:04:09.819]  PrisonPlanet.tv is how we finance much of what we do, and it's a great value, and it's a great activist tool, but it also supports us.
[03:04:10.319 --> 03:04:11.200]  So win, win, win, win.
[03:04:11.200 --> 03:04:12.461]  Thank you so much.
[03:04:12.461 --> 03:04:13.882]  Okay, we'll come back and take more calls.
[03:04:13.882 --> 03:04:16.024]  I'm going to let Pastor David J. Smith go now.
[03:04:16.024 --> 03:04:20.168]  He spent two hours with us today, and I want to have him back up in the near future.
[03:04:20.168 --> 03:04:28.295]  Thank you for your tireless work, sir, for my family, everybody else's family, and the great work you've done to try to bring people to the Lord.
[03:04:28.295 --> 03:04:31.678]  It's my pleasure, and God bless, and keep going.
[03:04:31.678 --> 03:04:32.398]  Take care, my friend.
[03:04:32.398 --> 03:04:32.678]  Thank you.
[03:04:33.709 --> 03:04:37.095]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with more of your calls first than a lot of news.
[03:04:37.095 --> 03:04:37.436]  1-800-259-9231 or 512-646-5400.
[03:04:37.436 --> 03:04:37.736]  Stay with us.
[03:04:45.168 --> 03:04:48.271]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[03:04:48.271 --> 03:04:53.796]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[03:04:53.796 --> 03:04:59.501]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[03:04:59.501 --> 03:05:01.002]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:05:01.002 --> 03:05:10.010]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[03:05:10.310 --> 03:05:12.132]  Now compare a cowbend pure soap.
[03:05:12.132 --> 03:05:16.357]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[03:05:16.357 --> 03:05:21.383]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[03:05:21.383 --> 03:05:23.465]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[03:05:25.247 --> 03:05:26.287]  Keep it natural.
[03:05:26.287 --> 03:05:34.690]  Call Calvin Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com.
[03:05:34.690 --> 03:05:39.272]  Try Calvin Pure Soaps and I'll bet you'll never use any other cleaning products again.
[03:05:39.272 --> 03:05:45.274]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[03:05:45.274 --> 03:05:47.755]  It is a big idea.
[03:05:47.755 --> 03:05:49.496]  A new world order.
[03:05:49.496 --> 03:05:50.456]  In the near future.
[03:05:51.320 --> 03:05:54.403]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:05:54.403 --> 03:05:57.225]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:05:57.225 --> 03:06:00.007]  Don't their objective be world domination?
[03:06:00.007 --> 03:06:03.190]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:06:03.190 --> 03:06:13.558]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:06:13.558 --> 03:06:18.502]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:06:19.002 --> 03:06:22.843]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:06:22.843 --> 03:06:25.424]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:06:25.424 --> 03:06:26.584]  Most people have no idea.
[03:06:26.584 --> 03:06:27.364]  They're not after money.
[03:06:27.364 --> 03:06:28.644]  They have all the money they need.
[03:06:28.644 --> 03:06:29.625]  They're after power.
[03:06:29.625 --> 03:06:30.765]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[03:06:30.765 --> 03:06:35.526]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[03:06:35.526 --> 03:06:39.507]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:06:39.507 --> 03:06:42.288]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[03:06:42.288 --> 03:06:43.448]  You have been warned.
[03:06:44.272 --> 03:06:45.873]  Wake up, Protestant America!
[03:06:45.873 --> 03:06:49.535]  There is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state.
[03:06:49.535 --> 03:06:55.599]  This confederation of Evangelicals, Catholics, and Protestant denominations will form one huge political voting bloc.
[03:06:55.599 --> 03:06:59.661]  Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation.
[03:06:59.661 --> 03:07:03.043]  Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom.
[03:07:03.263 --> 03:07:04.423]  Liberty of conscience.
[03:07:04.423 --> 03:07:09.084]  History and the Bible prove to them that these two systems, church and state, must be kept separate.
[03:07:09.084 --> 03:07:13.145]  It must be our love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us.
[03:07:13.145 --> 03:07:15.746]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement.
[03:07:15.746 --> 03:07:21.047]  From history we saw that when church and state united, known as Papal Rome, religious intolerance resulted.
[03:07:21.047 --> 03:07:24.708]  This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation.
[03:07:24.708 --> 03:07:27.289]  America and Papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[03:07:27.489 --> 03:07:30.250]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late!
[03:07:30.250 --> 03:07:32.190]  The prophecies are fast fulfilling!
[03:07:32.190 --> 03:07:33.771]  Jesus is coming soon!
[03:07:33.771 --> 03:07:36.292]  For free materials, call 888-211-1715.
[03:07:36.292 --> 03:07:46.095]  Or write The Bible Says, Box 99, Lenore City, Tennessee, 37771.
[03:07:46.095 --> 03:07:52.737]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:07:52.737 --> 03:07:55.718]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:09.042 --> 03:08:14.305]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:08:14.305 --> 03:08:18.448]  And now I'm gonna take some more of your calls, then we got a big news blitz coming up.
[03:08:18.448 --> 03:08:19.729]  I'm gonna skip ahead of everybody.
[03:08:19.729 --> 03:08:23.432]  Betty in Florida says she disagrees, so she'll go to the head of the line.
[03:08:23.432 --> 03:08:28.595]  Doesn't matter, my detractors still say all the calls are screened and fake.
[03:08:28.595 --> 03:08:37.561]  And even when they call in themselves, it's all part of the dishonesty and intellectual bankruptcy of those that claim only they fight the New World Order, no one else.
[03:08:38.528 --> 03:08:40.269]  But let's see if Betty really disagrees or not.
[03:08:40.269 --> 03:08:41.809]  Betty in Florida, go ahead.
[03:08:41.809 --> 03:08:43.329]  Hi, Alex.
[03:08:43.329 --> 03:08:52.171]  I really do disagree with you, but this time it has to do with when you were talking about the Catholic Church being part of the New World Order.
[03:08:52.171 --> 03:08:53.652]  Well, I mean, let's be clear here.
[03:08:53.652 --> 03:08:55.472]  I'm not bashing Catholics individually.
[03:08:55.472 --> 03:09:00.733]  I believe Pat Robertson and the main Protestant movement is controlled by the New World Order.
[03:09:00.733 --> 03:09:07.255]  I just had David J. Smith on to talk about how, well, I mean, the Catholic Church, no one can debate that Ratzinger is calling for a New World Order.
[03:09:08.280 --> 03:09:09.401]  No, I'm not debating that.
[03:09:09.401 --> 03:09:20.531]  What I'm debating is that, and this comes out, this message comes out over your show quite a bit, whether it's from you or it's from your callers, you've had Hutton Gibson on your show.
[03:09:20.531 --> 03:09:22.292]  Yes, I think he's a nice guy.
[03:09:22.292 --> 03:09:31.600]  Right, and you know that there's a distinction between those who follow the post-Vatican II church and those who decry it.
[03:09:31.600 --> 03:09:33.021]  Listen, here's the deal, here's the deal.
[03:09:33.021 --> 03:09:34.823]  The network runs the ads at once.
[03:09:35.824 --> 03:09:40.305]  There's a Catholic ad running about how the Catholic Church has been taken over by the New World Order.
[03:09:40.305 --> 03:09:41.225]  I have nothing to do with it.
[03:09:41.225 --> 03:09:44.286]  I'm accused of being a Jesuit for that being on.
[03:09:44.286 --> 03:09:50.068]  Then there's another ad that just aired saying that papal Rome is taking over and going to kill us all, basically.
[03:09:50.068 --> 03:09:51.748]  So I'm not involved with that.
[03:09:51.748 --> 03:09:53.349]  And I understand this is divisive.
[03:09:53.349 --> 03:09:55.689]  It's why our movement can never grow and go forward.
[03:09:55.689 --> 03:09:59.950]  Because everyone is obsessed with Jews, Catholics, Protestants.
[03:09:59.950 --> 03:10:02.031]  And I'm not joking when I say this, ma'am.
[03:10:02.031 --> 03:10:02.891]  I'm not joking.
[03:10:03.856 --> 03:10:04.897]  Uh, let me list everything.
[03:10:04.897 --> 03:10:14.126]  Last night, we were at the office, and by not joking, I mean, this is not made up, but I am joking in that I think it's funny, but it's also sick.
[03:10:14.126 --> 03:10:19.731]  And I am, according to many people, and I'm, uh, a, um, let me think of the best way to line it all up.
[03:10:19.731 --> 03:10:21.332]  There's so many to remember.
[03:10:21.332 --> 03:10:26.437]  A reptoid, Scientologist, Jesuit, uh, coagitator,
[03:10:28.163 --> 03:10:28.803]  Let me think, what else?
[03:10:28.803 --> 03:10:32.827]  Zionist, Nazi, CIA, Neanderthal.
[03:10:32.827 --> 03:10:37.771]  There's serious websites that show my head and claim I'm part of a Neanderthal devil race.
[03:10:37.771 --> 03:10:40.774]  Let me think of the other ones.
[03:10:40.774 --> 03:10:42.915]  Oh, there's a bunch of other ones out there.
[03:10:42.915 --> 03:10:51.943]  And most of our movement, the Liberty Movement, just spends its time all day bashing other groups, saying this is the leader, that's the leader, this person's got it right.
[03:10:51.943 --> 03:10:52.744]  I mean, I had some
[03:10:53.977 --> 03:11:04.960]  Law website sent me an email yesterday and it just said, I know more than you, I'm better than you, you better call and talk to me, you never have me on, you know, I'm gonna get you unless you call me.
[03:11:04.960 --> 03:11:05.600]  Get me!
[03:11:05.600 --> 03:11:07.061]  I don't care about you getting me.
[03:11:07.061 --> 03:11:14.183]  You know, the point is, is that I had people call me up, oh, let me think, I'm glad you bring this up actually.
[03:11:15.013 --> 03:11:22.102]  Uh, Betty, because I had a guy call me, like, or email me, like, seven, eight years ago, and it was like, you better interview me.
[03:11:22.102 --> 03:11:24.525]  You've been contacted by my people in heaven.
[03:11:24.525 --> 03:11:27.209]  If you don't, I'm going to expose you as working for the Vatican.
[03:11:28.292 --> 03:11:35.915]  And so I was like, my gosh, and then I didn't know that guy was like the leader of that movement, which is sad because, you know, people believe it's legitimate.
[03:11:35.915 --> 03:11:44.137]  Their leader says flying saucers are controlled by German soldiers and that the Earth is on a string with the universe orbiting it.
[03:11:44.137 --> 03:11:46.018]  I mean, these people are nuts!
[03:11:46.018 --> 03:11:55.701]  And so I think, well, there must not be truth to the Vatican running it, because they're making all these lies up about me and running around saying I'm a Catholic and a Vatican agent when I'm not.
[03:11:56.802 --> 03:12:02.045]  Uh, and then so I don't talk about it because I've been threatened that I'll be exposed if I don't.
[03:12:02.045 --> 03:12:04.327]  Well, I don't take to terrorism.
[03:12:04.327 --> 03:12:06.228]  You know, so it's kind of a reverse psychology.
[03:12:06.228 --> 03:12:15.014]  It's like, if they do think Jesuits run it all, that's how they would actually behave to act totally insane so no one would then follow them.
[03:12:15.014 --> 03:12:21.058]  And then once people attack you, they can never admit they're wrong, so they always find other things, uh, to add on to it.
[03:12:22.405 --> 03:12:26.530]  Uh, but at the same time, Tony Blair has become a Catholic so he can head Europe.
[03:12:26.530 --> 03:12:30.093]  Uh, the Catholic Church is calling for a world government.
[03:12:30.093 --> 03:12:34.939]  Uh, and I agree, the Catholic Church has certainly gotten more New World Order the last 30, 40 years.
[03:12:34.939 --> 03:12:37.541]  And I agree with Hutton Gibson that it's certainly New World Order now.
[03:12:37.541 --> 03:12:40.244]  You know, he writes a book saying the enemy's here.
[03:12:40.244 --> 03:12:42.527]  But see, that isn't enough for the Catholic bashers.
[03:12:43.047 --> 03:12:49.352]  You know, for Hutton Gibson and others to go and fight what Rome is doing and expose it, that it is an engine of New World Order.
[03:12:49.352 --> 03:12:59.180]  No, it's got to be all Catholics are going to hell, you're devils, we're good, you're not, and Alex is bad because he doesn't drip with pleasure bashing Catholics or
[03:12:59.820 --> 03:13:00.561]  We're good to go.
[03:13:15.553 --> 03:13:21.796]  I got all these letters from dioceses that people mail me saying, you know, turn your guns in, it's of the Lord, you don't need to own guns.
[03:13:21.796 --> 03:13:26.258]  But the Protestant churches are doing it too, so I try to get past labels.
[03:13:26.258 --> 03:13:27.919]  It's just nothing's taboo here.
[03:13:27.919 --> 03:13:30.240]  I mean, on air I said, what do you want to talk about, David J. Smith?
[03:13:30.240 --> 03:13:32.020]  And he said, I want to talk about Jesuits.
[03:13:32.020 --> 03:13:34.441]  So he could talk about Jesuits, you know?
[03:13:34.441 --> 03:13:36.482]  This is a free and open forum.
[03:13:36.482 --> 03:13:37.643]  Those that say that we're
[03:13:38.363 --> 03:13:42.704]  Run by the Zionists or run by the Jesuits or whatever it is that week.
[03:13:42.704 --> 03:13:43.625]  They lie about us.
[03:13:43.625 --> 03:13:45.445]  You know, they say your call was screamed.
[03:13:45.445 --> 03:13:47.666]  They say this is a staged call right now.
[03:13:47.666 --> 03:13:53.368]  Even though they call in, they still say... I've seen YouTube videos of them call in and go, they're fake stage calls.
[03:13:53.368 --> 03:13:54.228]  I'm going on air now.
[03:13:54.887 --> 03:13:57.088]  You know, I mean, this is the mental illness.
[03:13:57.088 --> 03:13:59.609]  And see, it's because I'm on the tip of the spear.
[03:13:59.609 --> 03:14:02.251]  I'm on the vanguard of fighting them, waking people up.
[03:14:02.251 --> 03:14:06.433]  And I know we're on the radio on 60-plus AM and FM stations.
[03:14:06.433 --> 03:14:15.577]  And people are driving around in Colorado and Missouri and Texas and New York and Florida and California on all these valiant mom-and-pop stations that pick us up.
[03:14:15.577 --> 03:14:18.218]  And they're going, what on earth is this guy talking about?
[03:14:18.218 --> 03:14:19.819]  These people sound like a bunch of nuts!
[03:14:20.459 --> 03:14:31.722]  Instead of us talking about the Federal Reserve being private, and torture, and the New World Order, and how they're doubling and tripling water prices, and, you know, that's why my show's been successful, because it is issue-oriented.
[03:14:31.722 --> 03:14:37.864]  And then as soon as you mention one of these groups, it goes into this big ball of wax, and you can't satisfy any of them.
[03:14:37.864 --> 03:14:43.546]  I could put on a Hitler mustache, howl Hitler, say Jews are devil seed, the Nazi groups are still going to attack.
[03:14:43.546 --> 03:14:46.507]  I could say Catholics are seed of Satan, running everything.
[03:14:46.507 --> 03:14:47.567]  It won't satisfy them.
[03:14:47.987 --> 03:14:49.348]  I'm not here to satisfy him.
[03:14:49.348 --> 03:14:50.809]  I'm here to really get at the truth.
[03:14:50.809 --> 03:14:56.693]  I respect David J. Smith, and he was saying that he thinks the Jesuits are highly involved, and there's no doubt today they are.
[03:14:56.693 --> 03:14:58.495]  Now, I've said my little five-minute rant.
[03:14:58.495 --> 03:14:59.936]  You go ahead and make your point.
[03:14:59.936 --> 03:15:01.697]  Thank you.
[03:15:01.697 --> 03:15:03.598]  Go ahead.
[03:15:03.598 --> 03:15:05.580]  I'm not attacking you either, Alex.
[03:15:05.580 --> 03:15:08.181]  I think you're a sincere Christian.
[03:15:08.181 --> 03:15:08.422]  I am.
[03:15:08.422 --> 03:15:09.002]  I'm sincere.
[03:15:09.002 --> 03:15:12.064]  I try to tell the truth and also try to not be divisive.
[03:15:12.064 --> 03:15:15.907]  What I'm trying to do is make the distinction for your listeners
[03:15:16.505 --> 03:15:23.707]  That there is a traditional, true Catholic Church that still exists and it is not part of the New World Order.
[03:15:23.707 --> 03:15:29.309]  You are very correct that every Pope since John XXIII has been part of it.
[03:15:29.309 --> 03:15:31.050]  They are open heretics.
[03:15:31.050 --> 03:15:33.691]  They are living, they were living heretics.
[03:15:33.691 --> 03:15:36.852]  Ratzinger in all his writings is part of the New World Order.
[03:15:36.852 --> 03:15:38.933]  The Jesuits are part of the New World Order.
[03:15:38.933 --> 03:15:39.993]  I don't disagree with that.
[03:15:41.067 --> 03:15:48.433]  What I disagree with is making the generalization that all Catholics are part of it because they are not.
[03:15:48.433 --> 03:15:54.077]  There are traditional Catholics who follow the traditional teachings of the Catholic Church.
[03:15:54.077 --> 03:15:54.657]  No, I know that.
[03:15:54.657 --> 03:15:56.899]  I mean, look at the fruits of Hutton Gibson and Mel Gibson.
[03:15:56.899 --> 03:15:57.459]  Exactly.
[03:15:57.459 --> 03:15:58.800]  They're fighting the New World Order.
[03:15:58.800 --> 03:16:01.342]  I know, you know, Hutton and his family personally.
[03:16:01.342 --> 03:16:02.463]  They're good people.
[03:16:02.463 --> 03:16:03.364]  They're not bad.
[03:16:03.364 --> 03:16:05.425]  They're fighting what Rome is doing.
[03:16:05.425 --> 03:16:09.088]  But that isn't enough for the people that, I mean, their religion is
[03:16:09.708 --> 03:16:11.550]  The Catholics are the source of all evil.
[03:16:11.550 --> 03:16:13.371]  If they were gone, everybody would be okay.
[03:16:13.371 --> 03:16:14.151]  And that's not it.
[03:16:14.151 --> 03:16:16.213]  It's evil in the hearts of men.
[03:16:16.213 --> 03:16:19.255]  They can take over any organization, any group.
[03:16:19.255 --> 03:16:23.538]  And Betty, I really appreciate your call, and I'm sorry what you heard earlier hurt your feelings.
[03:16:23.538 --> 03:16:32.245]  Listen, I want to fight face scanners going into the bars, where everyone must be face scanned when you go in a bar or when you buy cigarettes.
[03:16:32.245 --> 03:16:32.985]  Okay?
[03:16:32.985 --> 03:16:37.829]  I mean, that's a pretext to get buy-and-sell global face scanning, and as I told you a decade ago, they do.
[03:16:39.119 --> 03:16:49.865]  And I don't want to turn Catholics that are listening to this show off, where they won't go fight face scanners because they tune me out because I'm bashing Catholics, any more than the disgusting fake Protestants.
[03:16:49.865 --> 03:16:51.426]  See, I'm non-denominational.
[03:16:51.426 --> 03:16:52.847]  And then they tell me that's a denomination.
[03:16:52.847 --> 03:16:54.728]  What I mean is I'm not in any group.
[03:16:54.728 --> 03:16:56.088]  I just love Jesus.
[03:16:56.088 --> 03:17:06.194]  And see, then it turns into a show about religion when I'm just trying to cover the news, which I find to just be a million different groups fighting with each other and all running around saying they've got the answer.
[03:17:06.194 --> 03:17:07.775]  Listen, man, I'm just somebody going here.
[03:17:08.780 --> 03:17:14.842]  Daily Mail, AP, other articles, face scanners to catch drinkers.
[03:17:14.842 --> 03:17:18.403]  You know, I'm just trying to cover that.
[03:17:18.403 --> 03:17:24.805]  And then I've gotten, you know, threatened by groups, you better say it's Jews or we're going to kill you.
[03:17:24.805 --> 03:17:27.906]  And I'm like, God, these are really nasty people.
[03:17:27.906 --> 03:17:30.026]  Or you better say it's the Catholics or we're going to get you.
[03:17:30.026 --> 03:17:33.647]  And then they just, they engage in such intellectually bankrupt lies.
[03:17:33.647 --> 03:17:35.508]  I mean, they say things about me that are not true.
[03:17:37.068 --> 03:17:45.710]  And it's very painful, because... And I've asked all those groups, look, keep attacking me.
[03:17:45.710 --> 03:17:52.131]  Because if I tell them, don't attack me, they'll think, oh, you don't want to be attacked, it must be effective, we'll redouble it.
[03:17:52.131 --> 03:17:57.992]  It isn't that I individually don't like being attacked, in fact, it's wrong, and it's a sin.
[03:17:57.992 --> 03:18:05.714]  Last night at about midnight, we were winding down work here, working on the new film, and I'm going to be showing at the Alamo Draft House, coming up this Saturday and Sunday, only two showings and that's it.
[03:18:07.319 --> 03:18:09.381]  And Berman starts laughing, and I go, what is it?
[03:18:09.381 --> 03:18:12.665]  He's down there working on a film, too, with Aaron.
[03:18:12.665 --> 03:18:25.819]  And I walk over, and it's a 1950s horror film cover, very famous, of a woman screaming with her hand up, and he goes, look, they say you are a transvestite, and this is you!
[03:18:25.819 --> 03:18:29.903]  And we start laughing, but then I kind of got a sick feeling it's not funny.
[03:18:30.546 --> 03:18:44.315]  And then Rob Jacobson gets up and he goes, that's it, you're, and he's the one that said it, he goes, you are a Neanderthal, transvestite, Vatican assassin, Zionist, Nazi, because they say I'm a Nazi too, Scientologist, reptoid.
[03:18:44.315 --> 03:18:51.740]  And we all literally started laughing so hard we were crying, but then at the end of it, I just said, this isn't funny!
[03:18:51.740 --> 03:18:55.363]  You know, I mean, we can individually laugh about this, but that our movement
[03:18:56.756 --> 03:19:05.160]  is not the general listeners, not the main group, but so much of what's on YouTube and the web is just bedlam, man.
[03:19:05.160 --> 03:19:08.141]  It's just absolute bedlam.
[03:19:08.141 --> 03:19:20.127]  And then each group, you know, the Zionist group or the Catholics do-it-all group, they'll then say, well, don't mix me in with the Reptoids and the Neanderthal people and this, you know, we're being serious, but it's not serious.
[03:19:21.437 --> 03:19:22.017]  And you know what?
[03:19:22.017 --> 03:19:27.799]  I could even send the person the 1950s horror poster that that's not me with a wig on in drag.
[03:19:27.799 --> 03:19:28.619]  It doesn't matter.
[03:19:28.619 --> 03:19:31.680]  They're not going to say it's not me ever.
[03:19:31.680 --> 03:19:34.762]  Because they've committed to saying I'm this bad thing.
[03:19:34.762 --> 03:19:37.502]  They're invested in that and they're never going to go back.
[03:19:37.502 --> 03:19:40.784]  So I just want them to expose at least mercury and vaccines are a few things.
[03:19:40.784 --> 03:19:44.645]  Like, keep spending your time on me, but redouble your efforts and do some good, too.
[03:19:45.506 --> 03:19:49.310]  Hello, I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 15 books on health and natural healing.
[03:19:49.310 --> 03:19:53.455]  Vaccines included, medicines kill more people every year than any illness.
[03:19:53.455 --> 03:20:00.283]  The cost of drug side effects in America is more than $200 billion annually, with a worse toll taken by antibiotics.
[03:20:00.283 --> 03:20:03.167]  But there is a cure for this medical madness that has remained secret.
[03:20:03.547 --> 03:20:12.955]  OxySilver, developed by NASA scientists to keep astronauts healthy, is an evolutionary new dietary supplement making deadly vaccinations and antibiotics obsolete.
[03:20:12.955 --> 03:20:17.620]  Taking one to two teaspoons daily boosts natural immunity without drug toxicity.
[03:20:17.620 --> 03:20:20.722]  OxySilver combines oxygen and silver in a new way.
[03:20:20.722 --> 03:20:26.848]  The oxygen becomes a supercharged germ killer freeing your immune system to fight colds, flus, cancers and more.
[03:20:27.168 --> 03:20:33.570]  Build disease defenses naturally, painlessly, powerfully, safely, and inexpensively with OxySilver.
[03:20:33.570 --> 03:20:35.590]  Order your supply now by calling toll free 1-877-817-9829.
[03:20:35.590 --> 03:20:36.230]  That's 1-877-817-9829.
[03:20:36.230 --> 03:20:36.651]  Do it now.
[03:20:36.651 --> 03:20:37.451]  It is a big idea.
[03:20:37.451 --> 03:20:38.011]  A new world order.
[03:20:49.682 --> 03:20:54.187]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:20:54.187 --> 03:20:57.390]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:20:57.390 --> 03:21:00.193]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:21:00.193 --> 03:21:03.376]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:21:03.376 --> 03:21:10.684]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:21:13.717 --> 03:21:19.141]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:21:19.141 --> 03:21:23.043]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:21:23.043 --> 03:21:25.585]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:21:25.585 --> 03:21:26.766]  Most people have no idea.
[03:21:26.766 --> 03:21:27.526]  They're not after money.
[03:21:27.526 --> 03:21:28.827]  They have all the money they need.
[03:21:28.827 --> 03:21:29.808]  They're after power.
[03:21:29.808 --> 03:21:30.949]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[03:21:30.949 --> 03:21:39.674]  Order In Game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:21:39.674 --> 03:21:40.435]  In Game.
[03:21:40.435 --> 03:21:42.476]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[03:21:42.476 --> 03:21:43.557]  You have been warned.
[03:21:43.677 --> 03:21:44.438]  Yeah.
[03:22:03.835 --> 03:22:08.337]  Educating and motivating the American people to climb back into the driver's seat of Congress.
[03:22:08.337 --> 03:22:16.360]  Washington You're Fired lays out the last seven years of fundamentally flawed terror-related spy bills in a linear fashion that no one has ever constructed before.
[03:22:16.360 --> 03:22:21.163]  The resulting shift in our governmental power structure leaves the American people with only two choices.
[03:22:21.163 --> 03:22:24.064]  Be a part of the problem or be a part of the solution.
[03:22:24.064 --> 03:22:31.347]  Washington You're Fired is being described as the best patriotic video since Freedom to Fascism and we want you to get a copy and share it with your friends.
[03:22:31.907 --> 03:22:33.588]  We invite you to make the change.
[03:22:33.588 --> 03:22:35.449]  Help take back our government now.
[03:22:35.449 --> 03:22:39.710]  Go to TakeBackWashington.com and get the tools you need for the information war.
[03:22:39.710 --> 03:22:41.631]  We have a plan to take back our government.

[03:22:44.255 --> 03:22:50.261]  Attention GCN listeners, would you like to watch uncensored, unregulated, even banned TV on your computer?
[03:22:50.261 --> 03:23:02.151]  Well now you can watch satellite TV on your PC with an extremely simple hookup that allows computer owners to pick up more channels than any sane person can even watch without paying monthly cable or satellite fees.
[03:23:02.151 --> 03:23:02.952]  Here's the story.
[03:23:03.272 --> 03:23:11.440]  New video feed technology lets anyone with a high-speed internet connection gain instant access to an endless list of underground channels from all over the globe.
[03:23:11.440 --> 03:23:14.283]  And here's the best part, it's 100% legal.
[03:23:14.283 --> 03:23:20.709]  And it works at home, the office, or even in other countries to grab television channels and video feeds at your command.
[03:23:20.709 --> 03:23:25.013]  GCN listeners can use it to watch hundreds of conspiracy videos absolutely free.
[03:23:25.513 --> 03:23:29.838]  Best of all, you could be watching free TV on your PC in five minutes or less.
[03:23:29.838 --> 03:23:30.979]  It's that simple.
[03:23:30.979 --> 03:23:34.603]  Just go to www.orderfreetv.com.
[03:23:34.603 --> 03:23:37.906]  That's www.orderfreetv.com.
[03:23:37.906 --> 03:23:43.512]  To watch unregulated TV on your PC, go to www.orderfreetv.com.
[03:23:58.956 --> 03:24:04.260]  Coming up on a play this great video I saw put together on YouTube using some clips from my films.
[03:24:04.260 --> 03:24:05.661]  New World Order on trial.
[03:24:05.661 --> 03:24:07.963]  About five minutes long we'll be playing that coming up.
[03:24:07.963 --> 03:24:10.145]  All right, let's try to move through your calls a little bit quicker.
[03:24:10.145 --> 03:24:14.888]  I apologize to new listeners all across the country that had no idea what that whole discussion was earlier.
[03:24:14.888 --> 03:24:18.491]  Any movement's also going to have schizophrenics attracted to it.
[03:24:18.491 --> 03:24:22.314]  I mean, when the government's on TV saying everybody should be forced to take microchips,
[03:24:23.114 --> 03:24:31.579]  Uh, then that makes all the schizophrenics say, see, I told you they put chips in me, and maybe some of those that are schizophrenics really weren't schizophrenics and were under mind control.
[03:24:31.579 --> 03:24:38.422]  Uh, but you just got a lot of crazies out there, and this freeing up of the media is part of them having a venue, and some can say that about me.
[03:24:38.422 --> 03:24:42.825]  But I'm glad that we're having a larger open debate, um, you know, about all these subjects.
[03:24:42.825 --> 03:24:44.886]  I would just ask people that if you're gonna
[03:24:45.293 --> 03:24:49.776]  Engage in the morbidity of just attacking a bunch of innocent people and making crap up.
[03:24:49.776 --> 03:24:54.759]  Spend as much time attacking the New World Order and actually warning and waking up new people.
[03:24:54.759 --> 03:24:56.740]  That way you can have your cake and eat it too.
[03:24:56.740 --> 03:25:01.764]  There's few things in life, and frankly I still need the entertainment in a sick way, so don't stop.
[03:25:01.764 --> 03:25:11.290]  Maybe even increase your attacks on me a little, but then separately as a moral thing, spend time, you know, actually on something you can prove, and something we can do.
[03:25:12.111 --> 03:25:14.412]  Okay, and I've listed a lot of those issues.
[03:25:14.412 --> 03:25:15.473]  Okay, I'm already digressing.
[03:25:15.473 --> 03:25:17.714]  It doesn't matter.
[03:25:17.714 --> 03:25:21.896]  Let's talk to John in Texas and Robert, Mike, Haley, and Evian, and that's it.
[03:25:21.896 --> 03:25:23.156]  Go ahead, John.
[03:25:23.156 --> 03:25:24.917]  Oh, and then Alex over here, too.
[03:25:24.917 --> 03:25:25.898]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:25:25.898 --> 03:25:30.100]  Yeah, I was going to tell you that I'm going to be at the film premiere this weekend.
[03:25:30.100 --> 03:25:32.021]  I'm looking forward to it.
[03:25:32.021 --> 03:25:32.441]  Thank you.
[03:25:32.441 --> 03:25:38.024]  And my question was for Pastor Smith, but he's gone now, and he brought up the Knights of Malta.
[03:25:39.165 --> 03:25:42.186]  And, you know, the Jesuits and things, and I'm not a Catholic.
[03:25:42.186 --> 03:25:43.367]  No doubt it's New World Order.
[03:25:43.367 --> 03:25:44.367]  No one's debating.
[03:25:44.367 --> 03:25:46.688]  You heard a Catholic earlier say it is.
[03:25:46.688 --> 03:26:05.834]  Okay, I'm not a Catholic, and I'm not doing anything of that nature, but he brought Night of Malta up, and my question was about Patrick Buchanan, who's written all these sincere books about us losing our sovereignty and our borders and NAFTA and these bad trade deals, and he's even spoken out harshly against the New World Order on TV.
[03:26:05.834 --> 03:26:07.755]  I've seen him, but I also know
[03:26:08.297 --> 03:26:10.978]  He belongs to the Knights of Malta.
[03:26:10.978 --> 03:26:17.361]  And if there's any elaboration there, should we believe he's sincere?
[03:26:17.361 --> 03:26:18.422]  I really don't know.
[03:26:18.422 --> 03:26:23.404]  Well, you've got to judge somebody by their entire track record, and the stuff he did with Nixon is not good.
[03:26:23.404 --> 03:26:26.285]  But ever since then, he's done nothing but good stuff.
[03:26:26.285 --> 03:26:28.466]  People claim that I'm best buddies with him.
[03:26:28.466 --> 03:26:34.049]  I have met Pat Buchanan once at a Republican debate in 96, or was it earlier than that?
[03:26:34.588 --> 03:26:39.529]  And then it becomes their own little inquisition of, you know, have you ever known a communist?
[03:26:39.529 --> 03:26:40.369]  Did you ever know one?
[03:26:40.369 --> 03:26:42.770]  It's like McCarthyism.
[03:26:42.770 --> 03:26:51.731]  But we've interviewed Buchanan, and we're also supposed to not interview anybody that's Jewish for the anti-Zionist groups, and then we're also not supposed to interview anybody that's Catholic.
[03:26:51.731 --> 03:26:55.832]  Then they put a whole list of whoever you've interviewed that's Catholic, and then it's some great evil.
[03:26:55.832 --> 03:26:57.593]  Then they ask, how do you interview Buchanan?
[03:26:57.593 --> 03:26:58.233]  How do you get him?
[03:26:58.233 --> 03:26:59.553]  Well, you lazy jackasses.
[03:27:00.330 --> 03:27:04.611]  When he has a new book come out, could call the publisher and say, I'd like to interview him.
[03:27:04.611 --> 03:27:05.491]  That's how it works.
[03:27:05.491 --> 03:27:08.892]  Publishers every day mail us books and want us to interview these people.
[03:27:08.892 --> 03:27:15.553]  That's how I got that Rothschild on, and then attacked him, because he had a new book out, and people said, look, he's got a Rothschild on, he's in league with them.
[03:27:15.553 --> 03:27:17.753]  See, I'm asking people to be adult.
[03:27:17.753 --> 03:27:20.954]  The point is, Buchanan's putting out books that wake you up to the New World Order.
[03:27:20.954 --> 03:27:22.854]  You can use that book to wake people up.
[03:27:22.854 --> 03:27:24.895]  The book doesn't have anything bad in it.
[03:27:24.895 --> 03:27:27.115]  And so, no, I don't think he is, uh,
[03:27:28.024 --> 03:27:32.047]  See, it's not the lower or even mid-level people in any of these groups.
[03:27:32.047 --> 03:27:33.728]  It's the high-ups.
[03:27:33.728 --> 03:27:36.329]  And the New World Order runs all the major groups.
[03:27:36.329 --> 03:27:39.631]  So if you just say it's this group or that group, you fall into their hands.
[03:27:39.631 --> 03:27:42.053]  Carol Quigley at Georgetown said that in his book.
[03:27:42.053 --> 03:27:48.036]  He said, they can never beat us because they think it's one group or the other when we've got all the big major groups.
[03:27:48.036 --> 03:27:52.119]  We've got to get the people together to fight back against them on a larger scale.
[03:27:52.119 --> 03:27:54.380]  Yeah, and I'd like to make a point about this all.
[03:27:54.858 --> 03:28:04.048]  A part of our movement, when it comes to religious aspects, there's a part of our movement in films and books that dispute whether Jesus actually ever walked on Earth.
[03:28:04.048 --> 03:28:06.750]  Yeah, that's zeitgeist.
[03:28:06.750 --> 03:28:08.252]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[03:28:08.252 --> 03:28:09.193]  I gotta jump.
[03:28:09.193 --> 03:28:11.175]  That guy used clips of me on the internet.
[03:28:11.175 --> 03:28:12.156]  I get attacked for that.
[03:28:12.156 --> 03:28:13.757]  Why are you in zeitgeist?
[03:28:13.757 --> 03:28:15.779]  Why am I in 10 million videos on the web?
[03:28:15.779 --> 03:28:17.121]  They took my stuff and put it in there.
[03:28:18.485 --> 03:28:21.388]  You know, but again, it's this Inquisitor thing.
[03:28:21.388 --> 03:28:25.531]  I wish everybody would go inquisit their mayor, their county commissioner.
[03:28:25.531 --> 03:28:29.915]  I wish you'd go find out the public schools teaching the kids how to spy on you.
[03:28:29.915 --> 03:28:30.675]  But you won't do that.
[03:28:30.675 --> 03:28:34.699]  It's easier just to lazily say that I'm in league with the Tooth Fairy.
[03:28:34.699 --> 03:28:35.899]  Let's go ahead and make another call.
[03:28:35.899 --> 03:28:38.261]  Robin Florida, you're on the air.
[03:28:38.261 --> 03:28:40.043]  Hi Alec, first time caller.
[03:28:40.043 --> 03:28:40.623]  Welcome.
[03:28:40.623 --> 03:28:42.365]  I don't know what that was.
[03:28:44.229 --> 03:28:47.036]  Caller just recently been turned on to your stuff.
[03:28:47.036 --> 03:28:52.630]  I am a graduate of a seminary a Baptist seminary from out in North Texas and
[03:28:54.068 --> 03:29:05.439]  Just wondering what you think about, as far as reasons why our government goes after these other dictators, like Manuel Noriega, you can, the list goes on and on.
[03:29:05.439 --> 03:29:10.744]  What is the reasoning behind them going after these other dictators to promote these wars?
[03:29:10.744 --> 03:29:11.665]  Stay there, stay there.
[03:29:11.665 --> 03:29:13.326]  I'm gonna come right back to you on the other side.
[03:29:13.326 --> 03:29:15.008]  It's a great question.
[03:29:15.008 --> 03:29:17.891]  And, uh, Rob, and then we'll go to Mike.
[03:29:19.364 --> 03:29:21.586]  Haley and Evian and that's gonna be it for calls.

[03:29:45.253 --> 03:29:51.842]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[03:29:51.842 --> 03:29:58.051]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business and the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[03:29:58.051 --> 03:30:01.256]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[03:31:47.410 --> 03:31:51.172]  Hemp has nutritional values that far exceed any known plant.
[03:31:51.172 --> 03:31:54.954]  Hemp, used for food, clothing, and shelter since time began.
[03:31:54.954 --> 03:32:02.019]  Hemp, this God-given food source is controlled by your government, making it not legal to grow for American people and farmers, but legal to import.
[03:32:02.379 --> 03:32:05.900]  Our founding fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.
[03:32:05.900 --> 03:32:10.101]  The protein powder, seeds, and oil are available through hempusa.org.

[03:32:21.504 --> 03:32:26.025]  Hemp can be stored with a long shelf life as a life-sustaining food source for you and your family.
[03:32:26.025 --> 03:32:27.866]  Could this be the government's best-kept secret?

[03:33:06.983 --> 03:33:12.667]  Okay, let us now go back to the calls.
[03:33:12.667 --> 03:33:17.091]  Sometimes during break I forget what I was talking about, running around doing things during the break.
[03:33:20.635 --> 03:33:22.416]  I think we were talking to Rob in Florida, that's right.
[03:33:22.416 --> 03:33:25.518]  He was asking about why do they go take out dictators?
[03:33:25.518 --> 03:33:32.582]  Okay, let me try to give you my answer to this and then get your take on it or any follow-up questions, Rob.
[03:33:32.582 --> 03:33:36.244]  And it's basically just this.
[03:33:36.244 --> 03:33:37.584]  They're good, bad, and indifferent.
[03:33:37.584 --> 03:33:45.369]  They don't care if a nation really is run by a thug or run by an angel or run by a mix of in-between as it normally is.
[03:33:45.369 --> 03:33:49.251]  They just want a client state that will
[03:33:50.509 --> 03:33:51.450]  Follow orders.
[03:33:51.450 --> 03:33:55.812]  They want a client state that will do the will of the New World Order.
[03:33:55.812 --> 03:33:59.775]  And if Manuel Noriega, who they openly worked with, and George Bush Sr.
[03:33:59.775 --> 03:34:12.303]  met with, and openly worked with the CIA, and he owned giant palaces in Switzerland and France, and one next door to the Bushes, and laundered the money, and he publicly stopped paying his cocaine cut,
[03:34:12.930 --> 03:34:15.892]  And they just had a huge military invasion a few months later.
[03:34:15.892 --> 03:34:18.254]  And they announced that some of our women had been kidnapped.
[03:34:18.254 --> 03:34:19.795]  And we have interviews with the women.
[03:34:19.795 --> 03:34:21.136]  They said, we were never kidnapped.
[03:34:21.136 --> 03:34:24.019]  Special Forces showed up and said, stay inside our house.
[03:34:24.019 --> 03:34:24.939]  They were there to protect us.
[03:34:24.939 --> 03:34:29.643]  And then the gunships an hour later attacked.
[03:34:29.643 --> 03:34:34.086]  So whenever I say we shouldn't attack Iran, that doesn't mean I'm even defending Iran.
[03:34:34.086 --> 03:34:35.687]  Most governments are wicked and evil.
[03:34:35.687 --> 03:34:40.271]  That's the nature of governments and powerful type people that are willing to do what it takes to get into power.
[03:34:40.271 --> 03:34:41.692]  They're intelligent, but also ruthless.
[03:34:42.523 --> 03:34:44.103]  So, but you have the globalists.
[03:34:44.103 --> 03:34:45.524]  It's like a global risk game.
[03:34:45.524 --> 03:34:50.045]  They've almost got all the countries on the table, but a few, quote, rogue nations.
[03:34:50.045 --> 03:34:53.145]  Some of those nations are good, some are bad, some are in between.
[03:34:53.145 --> 03:34:58.506]  The point is the globalists want a monopoly so that they have total control across the planet.
[03:34:58.506 --> 03:35:01.587]  And they say that that's what they want.
[03:35:01.587 --> 03:35:05.047]  So that's why they overthrow dictators and put other dictators in.
[03:35:05.047 --> 03:35:07.408]  I mean, all over the world, the United States,
[03:35:08.320 --> 03:35:14.741]  Again, a unit of the Anglo-American Empire, regardless of who's running it, we know it's the Anglo-American Empire.
[03:35:14.741 --> 03:35:20.543]  They go around overthrowing nations and actually putting dictators in.
[03:35:20.543 --> 03:35:25.824]  The Arabs were somewhat secular in the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, and the public U.S.
[03:35:25.824 --> 03:35:31.245]  policy was to go and fund radical, mainly Wahhabist, out of British-controlled and created Saudi Arabia.
[03:35:32.071 --> 03:35:35.555]  To radically go in and machine gun bomb kill as a shock force.
[03:35:35.555 --> 03:35:40.059]  They used those on all the other Arab and bunch of Central Asian countries and took them over.
[03:35:40.059 --> 03:35:44.864]  Then had the same group attack the Russians in 79 to get them to attack Afghanistan.
[03:35:44.864 --> 03:35:49.108]  That's admitted history, but nobody knows that they think Russians just attacked.
[03:35:49.108 --> 03:35:50.449]  And again, not defending the Russians.
[03:35:50.449 --> 03:35:51.871]  They were evil as well.
[03:35:51.871 --> 03:35:53.212]  See, that's what confuses people.
[03:35:53.212 --> 03:35:54.694]  It's like, well, are you for us or the Russians?
[03:35:55.194 --> 03:35:55.594]  Well, no.
[03:35:55.594 --> 03:36:00.976]  It was the Russians were a corrupt empire, but then the globalists went and attacked them to get them to come in.
[03:36:00.976 --> 03:36:08.938]  And at a higher level, that was all a game too, to really play off the nations, the Central Asian nations, and keep them from industrializing.
[03:36:08.938 --> 03:36:10.458]  That was meant to wreck infrastructure.
[03:36:10.458 --> 03:36:15.439]  It was also meant to bankrupt Russia to bring further banker control in.
[03:36:15.439 --> 03:36:17.040]  So, this is how they operate.
[03:36:17.040 --> 03:36:21.301]  It's like they used the Muslims to attack the Serbs, because they were sovereign.
[03:36:21.301 --> 03:36:22.581]  So, does that answer your question, sir?
[03:36:23.793 --> 03:36:24.814]  That certainly does.
[03:36:24.814 --> 03:36:31.016]  The reason why I ask that is because, from my heritage, my grandmother immigrated here from Panama.
[03:36:31.016 --> 03:36:35.137]  My grandfather was stationed in the Panama Canal during World War II.
[03:36:35.137 --> 03:36:52.124]  And my great-uncle, who was still living in Panama at the time, he was high up in the government of Panama before Noriega took over and had to flee the country for his life, because once Noriega gained power, he basically was exterminating anyone who was dissident to his rule.
[03:36:53.602 --> 03:37:08.275]  And it's just kind of having known the United States' dealings with Noriega, kind of a matter of hypocrisy that they will deal with somebody and then turn around and go and then depose them.
[03:37:08.275 --> 03:37:11.357]  Well, I agree, but it's not even hypocrisy.
[03:37:11.357 --> 03:37:12.258]  This is a plan.
[03:37:12.258 --> 03:37:15.921]  I mean, they wrote, there's declassified textbooks on this.
[03:37:15.921 --> 03:37:16.361]  Of course.
[03:37:16.361 --> 03:37:20.024]  They didn't want the poet that spoke five languages and had 170 IQ and was secular
[03:37:22.518 --> 03:37:24.499]  Mohammed Mosaddegh was pro-U.S.
[03:37:24.499 --> 03:37:27.040]  and trained in the West as a president.
[03:37:27.040 --> 03:37:32.863]  They sent in Wahhabist Muslims into the Shiite Iran, and they sent Al-Qaeda in.
[03:37:32.863 --> 03:37:39.927]  The British intel with the section chief CIA commander Kermit Roosevelt, grandson of the president, and they wrote books about it.
[03:37:39.927 --> 03:37:43.168]  It's all declassified, and they staged terror attacks and blamed it on him.
[03:37:43.168 --> 03:37:44.689]  They bombed mosques and blamed it on him.
[03:37:44.689 --> 03:37:46.370]  A reverse false flag.
[03:37:46.370 --> 03:37:50.312]  Very complex to implement, but they admit they did it.
[03:37:51.267 --> 03:37:53.508]  And it's the same thing.
[03:37:53.508 --> 03:37:56.909]  It isn't that they deal with dictators.
[03:37:56.909 --> 03:38:04.712]  They got Saddam when he was 18, top of his class, military academy, well-known secular family.
[03:38:04.712 --> 03:38:13.196]  They sent him to Egypt for four years in CIA, in coding, espionage, explosives as a commander.
[03:38:13.196 --> 03:38:16.797]  He helped run hit teams that killed hundreds of the Socialist Ba'ath.
[03:38:17.846 --> 03:38:19.267]  He was unstoppable.
[03:38:19.267 --> 03:38:20.788]  Then the Ba'athists came to the U.S.
[03:38:20.788 --> 03:38:23.010]  and said, we now want to do whatever you say.
[03:38:23.010 --> 03:38:26.692]  He machine-gunned the president, shot him twice, almost killed him.
[03:38:26.692 --> 03:38:28.774]  So they came and said, look, stop trying to kill us.
[03:38:28.774 --> 03:38:39.501]  And the U.S., controlled by the globalists, this is all declassified public, said, okay, put our man, now 30-something years old, Saddam Hussein, in 1969, trained in 48 through 52,
[03:38:43.365 --> 03:38:43.865]  We're good to go.
[03:39:01.552 --> 03:39:06.695]  Now that they were in place, they started a war with Iran, hundreds of billions, but he owed 35 billion.
[03:39:06.695 --> 03:39:08.956]  He over pumped oil to try to pay off his debts.
[03:39:08.956 --> 03:39:10.697]  He then wanted to actually be a leader.
[03:39:10.697 --> 03:39:12.338]  They said, no, you work for us.
[03:39:12.338 --> 03:39:14.039]  Then he said, well, I'm going to invade Kuwait.
[03:39:14.039 --> 03:39:14.759]  They're stealing oil.
[03:39:14.759 --> 03:39:16.400]  They said, go ahead, we're behind you.
[03:39:16.400 --> 03:39:22.143]  Then they set him up, claimed he threw babies out of incubators, put out fake PR, went and attacked him.
[03:39:22.143 --> 03:39:28.747]  They've been running 18 years of siege, killed over 3 million Iraqis, a million plus since the last five and a half years of invasion.
[03:39:29.347 --> 03:39:30.427]  And it's a huge black op.
[03:39:30.427 --> 03:39:34.389]  They're building bases all over to carry out regional extermination ops.
[03:39:34.389 --> 03:39:38.090]  And even in government documents, they are genocide citadels.
[03:39:38.090 --> 03:39:45.732]  Armored techno-citadels that then direct the turning of Iraq into a Stone Age nation.
[03:39:45.732 --> 03:39:58.976]  Then they roll in with the UN forces as the saviors later, after a decade of US occupation, with forced inoculation, sterilization compounds, further black op, which they mean to roll into Iran, Syria, and every other Arab nation.
[03:39:59.176 --> 03:39:59.937]  It sure does.
[03:39:59.937 --> 03:40:03.439]  It's all part of the freedom, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:40:24.013 --> 03:40:29.821]  That's why I don't even... I want to live, I don't want to die, but I'm not even worried if they kill me anymore, because it's like, you gotta fight these people.
[03:40:29.821 --> 03:40:33.766]  I mean, this is the most diabolical stuff that anybody could ever come up with.
[03:40:33.766 --> 03:40:36.890]  I mean, it's just... Oh, God.
[03:40:37.930 --> 03:40:43.132]  They always betray their minions, just like they create the Mujahideen 80 years ago.
[03:40:43.132 --> 03:40:45.072]  They use them to take over regional areas.
[03:40:45.072 --> 03:40:46.693]  They use them against Russia.
[03:40:46.693 --> 03:40:48.373]  They use them against Iran.
[03:40:48.373 --> 03:40:52.494]  They're using them... The government admits they're using, quote, Al-Qaeda to attack Iran.
[03:40:52.494 --> 03:40:55.275]  They've been bombing mosques, blowing up government buildings.
[03:40:55.275 --> 03:40:57.036]  Right now, Iran's suing the U.S.
[03:40:57.036 --> 03:41:01.917]  because they said you publicly admit you fund Al-Qaeda.
[03:41:01.917 --> 03:41:04.458]  It's so sick how dumb they treat us.
[03:41:05.495 --> 03:41:10.178]  You know what, I'm just going to play this right now and then go to your calls, because I don't want to run out of time and miss this.
[03:41:10.178 --> 03:41:11.659]  This is the New World Order on trial.
[03:41:11.659 --> 03:41:14.500]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[03:41:14.500 --> 03:41:16.581]  Right now, it is really good.
[03:41:16.581 --> 03:41:21.624]  If you're a PrisonPlanet.tv member, you can see the video of this right now.
[03:41:21.624 --> 03:41:28.208]  So go sign up at PrisonPlanet.tv if you have not yet become a member, because this fourth hour, or like yesterday, we did three hours live,
[03:41:28.823 --> 03:41:35.909]  Hour and a half with Galen Ross, an hour and a half with myself, and then we post these later if you don't watch it live at PrisonPlanet.tv for members.
[03:41:35.909 --> 03:41:37.370]  And by the way, there's a lot of good shows.
[03:41:37.370 --> 03:41:39.992]  There's like 20 plus of them archived now.
[03:41:39.992 --> 03:41:46.257]  They're on PrisonPlanet.tv that a lot of you probably haven't seen, so be sure and get those and make copies of them, put them on disk.
[03:41:46.257 --> 03:41:50.660]  The file size isn't too big, and you can get them out to people.
[03:41:50.660 --> 03:41:52.602]  Let's see, I figured out their formula.
[03:41:53.712 --> 03:41:54.772]  By reading their own documents.
[03:41:54.772 --> 03:41:55.813]  And I'm just trying to warn people.
[03:41:55.813 --> 03:41:57.073]  That's all I'm trying to do.
[03:41:57.073 --> 03:42:02.115]  You can figure out who's behind it and what the penultimate goal is and the rest of it yourself.
[03:42:02.115 --> 03:42:05.357]  I'm just exposing how they operate, what they're doing.
[03:42:05.357 --> 03:42:06.737]  I'm gonna go ahead and go to this now.
[03:42:06.737 --> 03:42:07.097]  Here it is.
[03:42:07.097 --> 03:42:09.098]  New World Order on trial.
[03:42:28.012 --> 03:42:34.016]  What is at stake is more than one small country.
[03:42:34.016 --> 03:42:35.477]  It is a big idea.
[03:42:35.477 --> 03:42:40.820]  A New World Order.
[03:42:40.820 --> 03:42:48.104]  Out of these troubled times, our fifth objective, the New World Order, can emerge.
[03:42:48.104 --> 03:42:52.047]  Now we can see a new world coming into view.
[03:42:52.047 --> 03:42:55.949]  A world in which there is a very real prospect of a New World Order.
[03:42:56.738 --> 03:43:04.766]  We have before us the opportunity to forge for ourselves and for future generations a new world order.
[03:43:04.766 --> 03:43:11.972]  A world where the rule of law, not the law of the jungle, governs the conduct of nations.
[03:43:11.972 --> 03:43:18.899]  When we are successful, and we will be, we have a real chance at this new world order in order...
[03:43:42.836 --> 03:43:46.158]  This is no fantasy.
[03:43:46.158 --> 03:43:50.001]  No careless product of wild imagination.
[03:43:50.001 --> 03:43:53.944]  No, my good friends.
[03:43:53.944 --> 03:44:05.332]  These indictments that I've brought you today... Specific charges listed herein against the individuals.
[03:44:05.332 --> 03:44:08.935]  Their acts of treason, their ultimate aim of sedition.
[03:44:12.419 --> 03:44:21.346]  These are matters of undeniable fact.
[03:44:21.346 --> 03:44:35.296]  I ask you now to pronounce judgment on those accused.
[03:44:35.296 --> 03:44:35.656]  On this
[03:44:37.413 --> 03:44:45.518]  This mindless aberration, whose only means of expression are wanton violence and destruction.
[03:44:45.518 --> 03:44:51.181]  Once trusted by this council, charged with maintaining the defense of the planet itself.
[03:44:51.181 --> 03:45:00.145]  Chief architect of this intended revolution and author of this insidious plot to establish a new order amongst us.
[03:45:00.145 --> 03:45:05.568]  With himself as absolute ruler.
[03:45:05.568 --> 03:45:06.589]  You have heard the evidence.
[03:45:08.843 --> 03:45:11.409]  The decision of the council will now be heard.
[03:45:11.409 --> 03:45:13.755]  Guilty.
[03:45:13.755 --> 03:45:14.917]  Guilty.
[03:45:14.917 --> 03:45:17.002]  Guilty.
[03:45:17.002 --> 03:45:17.483]  Guilty.
[03:45:51.876 --> 03:46:00.731]  After 1989, President Bush said, and it's a phrase that I often use myself, that we needed a new world order.
[03:46:00.731 --> 03:46:02.534]  A new world order.
[03:46:02.534 --> 03:46:05.438]  A new world, a new world, a new world order.
[03:46:25.539 --> 03:46:26.860]  We're good to go.
[03:47:18.672 --> 03:47:21.354]  The way we're going to win over the long term is not just militarily.
[03:47:21.354 --> 03:47:28.259]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order, world order, world order, world order that I think all of us would like.
[03:47:28.259 --> 03:47:30.781]  The problem of the Bush presidency
[03:47:46.793 --> 03:47:50.316]  We'll be the emergence of a new international order.
[03:47:50.316 --> 03:47:54.560]  Within the next four years, we will see the emergence of a new international order.
[03:47:54.560 --> 03:47:57.843]  The beginning of a new international order.
[03:47:57.843 --> 03:48:03.948]  In this new world, we'll have a profound impact.
[03:48:03.948 --> 03:48:14.116]  The forces shaping this world, at this moment, are so strong, and they all tend in one direction.
[03:48:19.653 --> 03:48:24.274]  What is the structure necessary for global justice?
[03:48:24.274 --> 03:48:30.576]  To establish a new world order, it is a big
[03:48:52.571 --> 03:49:04.001]  A new world order.
[03:49:04.001 --> 03:49:05.822]  A new world order.
[03:49:41.532 --> 03:49:44.093]  All right, and you can see a little bit more of that online.
[03:49:44.093 --> 03:49:52.397]  The Council on Foreign Relations, as Pete mentioned, I've been a member for a long time and was actually a director for some period of time.
[03:49:52.397 --> 03:49:55.899]  I never mentioned that when I was campaigning for re-election back home in Wyoming.
[03:50:03.217 --> 03:50:09.079]  Yeah, that's Dick Cheney laughing at everybody saying that he wouldn't tell his constituents the CFR existed.
[03:50:09.079 --> 03:50:12.621]  Of course, Limbaugh, his buddy, lies to him and says it doesn't.
[03:50:12.621 --> 03:50:16.282]  We'll come back, take a few final phone calls, and I guess I didn't get to all the news.
[03:50:16.282 --> 03:50:18.023]  I don't think I'm doing a fifth hour.
[03:50:18.023 --> 03:50:19.064]  Wait a minute, maybe I should.
[03:50:19.064 --> 03:50:21.905]  But wait, I have films to make.
[03:50:21.905 --> 03:50:22.885]  I have too much work to do.
[03:50:22.885 --> 03:50:27.327]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, final segment.
[03:50:27.327 --> 03:50:30.988]  We're going to talk to Mike.
[03:50:30.988 --> 03:50:31.629]  We're going to talk to
[03:50:34.508 --> 03:50:37.856]  Haley and Evian.
[03:50:37.856 --> 03:50:40.923]  What a pretty name, Evian.
[03:50:40.923 --> 03:50:41.684]  We'll be right back.
[03:50:45.626 --> 03:50:49.387]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[03:50:49.387 --> 03:50:54.109]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[03:50:54.109 --> 03:50:59.391]  I have run across a company called SFR, who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[03:50:59.391 --> 03:51:10.615]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, Protecta Complete Fuel System Treatment cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage in only one tank full.
[03:51:10.615 --> 03:51:12.976]  Protecta Engine Treatment not only reduces friction,
[03:51:13.396 --> 03:51:15.436]  But it extends the life of your engine.
[03:51:15.436 --> 03:51:16.337]  Let's face it.
[03:51:16.337 --> 03:51:19.177]  With the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[03:51:19.177 --> 03:51:27.198]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment which is a $12.95 value free.
[03:51:27.198 --> 03:51:29.499]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[03:51:29.499 --> 03:51:32.619]  That number again is 888-USE-SFR1.
[03:51:32.619 --> 03:51:36.680]  Or check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com.
[03:51:36.680 --> 03:51:38.841]  That's oilcompanysecret.com.
[03:51:38.841 --> 03:51:41.221]  Satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[03:51:41.701 --> 03:51:43.142]  And it's safe for all cars.
[03:51:43.142 --> 03:51:45.603]  Act now.
[03:51:45.603 --> 03:51:47.023]  It is a big idea.
[03:51:47.023 --> 03:51:49.844]  A New World Order.
[03:51:49.844 --> 03:51:54.746]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:51:54.746 --> 03:51:57.567]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:51:57.567 --> 03:52:00.368]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:52:00.368 --> 03:52:03.529]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:52:03.529 --> 03:52:10.852]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:52:13.888 --> 03:52:19.332]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:52:19.332 --> 03:52:22.734]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:52:44.709 --> 03:52:45.529]  Hey, Emily.
[03:52:45.529 --> 03:52:46.610]  Wow, you look great!
[03:52:46.610 --> 03:52:47.651]  I feel great.
[03:52:47.651 --> 03:52:49.732]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[03:52:49.732 --> 03:52:50.272]  Really?
[03:52:50.272 --> 03:52:50.893]  What is it?
[03:52:50.893 --> 03:52:51.553]  How does it work?
[03:52:51.553 --> 03:52:58.298]  MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from your body.
[03:52:58.298 --> 03:53:00.779]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[03:53:00.779 --> 03:53:06.103]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[03:53:06.423 --> 03:53:07.204]  That's it?
[03:53:07.204 --> 03:53:08.985]  It sounds so easy and convenient.
[03:53:08.985 --> 03:53:09.885]  It is easy.
[03:53:09.885 --> 03:53:16.890]  Plus, the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[03:53:16.890 --> 03:53:18.711]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[03:53:18.711 --> 03:53:19.831]  That's amazing!
[03:53:19.831 --> 03:53:25.175]  And, the bentonite clay and MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[03:53:25.475 --> 03:53:26.035]  Well, how?
[03:53:26.035 --> 03:53:27.417]  Where can I buy a MediCleanse?
[03:53:27.417 --> 03:53:30.359]  A one-month supply is available online at MediCleanse.com.
[03:53:30.359 --> 03:53:33.682]  That's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E dot com.
[03:53:33.682 --> 03:53:37.284]  For only $22.95 plus shipping, MediCleanse is shipped directly to you.
[03:53:37.284 --> 03:53:37.925]  Or call them at 1-800-317-9547.
[03:53:37.925 --> 03:53:38.145]  That's 1-800-317-9547.
[03:53:38.145 --> 03:53:38.525]  Call today.
[03:53:38.525 --> 03:53:39.246]  Well, you were sleeping.
[03:53:39.246 --> 03:53:40.347]  Because I want to get to, uh...
[03:53:54.119 --> 03:54:05.568]  Mike, Haley, Evan, Alex, George, Leo, and Hale do the news blitz like I promised.
[03:54:05.568 --> 03:54:06.769]  So we're going to do that.
[03:54:06.769 --> 03:54:15.316]  You know, we're going to fix things with an inside job.
[03:54:15.316 --> 03:54:21.261]  Changing ourselves first, having the courage to stand up, courage to fight back, courage to get involved.
[03:54:23.595 --> 03:54:27.036]  Just like it always is.
[03:54:27.036 --> 03:54:33.819]  Chalk it up to business as usual.
[03:54:33.819 --> 03:54:36.060]  I know it's hard to live out in the light.
[03:54:51.919 --> 03:54:54.381]  All right.
[03:54:54.381 --> 03:55:06.170]  Final segment of the main Genesis transmission back tomorrow.
[03:55:06.170 --> 03:55:07.371]  11 a.m.
[03:55:07.371 --> 03:55:07.652]  To 3 p.m.
[03:55:17.495 --> 03:55:21.516]  And then, of course, we do Overdrive some days, and it already streams as soon as the show's over.
[03:55:21.516 --> 03:55:24.437]  If you're missing it, David J. Smith or other topics I covered.
[03:55:24.437 --> 03:55:30.118]  We're going to go into Overdrive for about 20 minutes today, though, to take everybody's calls and hit some news I wanted to get to.
[03:55:30.118 --> 03:55:35.460]  But before we do that, here at the end of the main show, I'm showing my new film, 9-11 Truth Rising.
[03:55:36.312 --> 03:55:38.393]  I mean, it's just an amazing documentary.
[03:55:38.393 --> 03:55:39.853]  It's cinema verite.
[03:55:39.853 --> 03:55:40.813]  There's no voiceover.
[03:55:40.813 --> 03:55:41.953]  It's very well done.
[03:55:41.953 --> 03:55:43.314]  Very professional.
[03:55:43.314 --> 03:55:44.094]  Two showings!
[03:55:44.094 --> 03:55:48.755]  And then I'm going to take your feedback and make a few tweaks and release the film in about a month and a half.
[03:55:48.755 --> 03:55:53.636]  It'll first be on PrisonPlanet.tv for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and the DVDs will ship out to everybody.
[03:55:53.636 --> 03:55:55.597]  It really is an amazing film.
[03:55:55.597 --> 03:55:57.157]  Two years in the making.
[03:55:57.157 --> 03:56:00.498]  And it's kind of a sleeper because I'm so busy working I haven't had time to hype it up.
[03:56:00.498 --> 03:56:01.318]  But it really is.
[03:56:02.654 --> 03:56:06.755]  The best-looking, most entertaining film I've ever made, and it's also very informative.
[03:56:06.755 --> 03:56:08.595]  So, I hope you'll be there this Saturday.
[03:56:08.595 --> 03:56:25.979]  Go to InfoWars.com, link through to buy your tickets, at InfoWars.com, to the Saturday, 3.30 p.m., downtown Austin at the Alamo Draft House Ritz, and then Sunday night after my radio show, 6.30 to like 9 at night, I'll be giving a 30-minute speech at the beginning as well, so get your tickets.
[03:56:25.979 --> 03:56:29.780]  More than half have sold for the first showing, half have sold for the second showing, so
[03:56:31.528 --> 03:56:32.828]  There aren't a lot of tickets left.
[03:56:32.828 --> 03:56:36.009]  They always hold about 10% of the tickets, though, to at the door.
[03:56:36.009 --> 03:56:41.111]  So you can go to the door now and buy them, or buy them the day of at the door, but it's limited.
[03:56:41.111 --> 03:56:42.171]  So hope to see you there.
[03:56:42.171 --> 03:56:44.072]  Also, I meant to talk about this during the main show.
[03:56:44.072 --> 03:56:45.092]  I didn't.
[03:56:45.092 --> 03:56:46.693]  It's the InfoWars Money Bomb.
[03:56:46.693 --> 03:56:49.333]  The website's InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[03:56:49.333 --> 03:56:52.114]  InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[03:56:52.114 --> 03:56:57.656]  This is the guy that originally came up with the idea of the May 31st 08 Money Bomb.
[03:56:58.815 --> 03:56:59.195]  I don't know.
[03:57:15.949 --> 03:57:25.434]  It just so happens that I want to gear up, build a stage, build a system to do a national TV show at least once a week on cable.
[03:57:25.434 --> 03:57:26.835]  On Dish Network or one of those.
[03:57:26.835 --> 03:57:29.036]  It's very easy to do.
[03:57:29.036 --> 03:57:31.577]  Well, it's hard to do, but easier than you think is the way to put it.
[03:57:31.577 --> 03:57:33.358]  It just takes capital.
[03:57:33.358 --> 03:57:34.058]  We want to do that.
[03:57:34.058 --> 03:57:37.720]  We want to go into a bigger office, do a lot of new things, but it takes money.
[03:57:38.340 --> 03:57:39.862]  And this is perfect.
[03:57:39.862 --> 03:57:42.305]  The InfoWars money bomb for May 31st.
[03:57:42.305 --> 03:57:44.008]  Go pledge on the site.
[03:57:44.008 --> 03:57:48.153]  And they want to get 20,000 people to give $100 on that day.
[03:57:48.153 --> 03:57:52.619]  And we did this for Ron Paul and everybody else, and I can't think of a better place to give.
[03:57:52.619 --> 03:57:54.942]  Also, if I don't plug this, then it's a bomb.
[03:57:56.016 --> 03:57:59.599]  In a bad way, then it'll be like, oh look, they only raised $10,000.
[03:57:59.599 --> 03:58:02.721]  We can raise people hundreds of thou all the time.
[03:58:02.721 --> 03:58:05.102]  Ron Paul admits we raised millions of his millions.
[03:58:05.102 --> 03:58:14.529]  So, I would hope you'd raise money, and we will put it all into, all of it, into buying cameras, better equipment, better studio, and paying for airtime on TV.
[03:58:14.529 --> 03:58:14.709]  So,
[03:58:15.698 --> 03:58:16.940]  InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
