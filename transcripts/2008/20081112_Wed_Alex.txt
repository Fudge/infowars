[00:00:04.913 --> 00:00:06.233]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.233 --> 00:00:07.994]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.994 --> 00:00:09.754]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.754 --> 00:00:11.315]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.315 --> 00:00:12.235]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.235 --> 00:00:17.077]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.077 --> 00:00:21.138]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.743 --> 00:00:29.264]  It is the 12th day of November 2008.
[00:00:29.264 --> 00:00:33.365]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:33.365 --> 00:00:37.346]  Very important broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:00:37.346 --> 00:00:45.648]  Alan Watts, to break down the mass mind control going on with the staged election of 2008, will join us from Canada.
[00:00:45.648 --> 00:00:54.251]  Then Gary Franchi, who's heading up the Get Rid of the Fed, Abolish the Fed movement nationwide with demonstrations.
[00:00:55.141 --> 00:01:01.204]  For the 22nd of November at every private Federal Reserve branch across the country.
[00:01:01.204 --> 00:01:08.668]  By the way, I have a clip of Alan Greenspan admitting that the Federal Reserve basically runs everything and is beholden to no one.
[00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:21.777]  Ralph Nader will also be joining us today to talk about what's happening with the whole takeover by the private banks, the corporate looting, the heist that is intensifying.
[00:01:21.777 --> 00:01:30.401]  And then Larry Pratt will join us for the last 30 minutes of the broadcast today to talk more about record gun sales, all-time records broken nationwide.
[00:01:30.401 --> 00:01:36.985]  So Alan Watt, Gary Franchi, Ralph Nader, and Larry Pratt today right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:01:39.466 --> 00:02:00.234]  In the meantime, there's a great story, very informative, by Paul Watson up on PrisonPlanet.com dealing with more information emerging about Barack Obama's youth brigades, his civilian defense corps, his national draft.
[00:02:00.234 --> 00:02:08.758]  And we not only have his own statements and his chief of staff statements admitting it'll be mandatory, and that it'll affect basically even the elderly, up to
[00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.200]  Up to their seventies, I will be quote, required to slave.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.581]  And to be, to learn what it is to be an American.
[00:02:17.581 --> 00:02:19.422]  To be re-educated.
[00:02:19.422 --> 00:02:22.002]  To learn how to spy on their neighbors.
[00:02:22.002 --> 00:02:24.443]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[00:02:24.443 --> 00:02:35.406]  Well, it turns out back in 96, Rahm Emanuel, who engineered the big Democratic takeover in the House, and of course kept the war going, that was what his stated job was, was to defeat anti-war Democrats and real liberals.
[00:02:37.446 --> 00:02:43.770]  He talked to, well, several newspapers, but a new one has emerged with the New York Daily News.
[00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:54.317]  It's during a cocktail party being recorded, so the audio is a bit, well, it's pretty good audio, it's just there's a lot of clinking of glasses and jazz playing in the background.
[00:02:54.317 --> 00:03:02.582]  And he basically restates word for word everything that's in his book and everything that was on change.org, or excuse me, change.gov.
[00:03:02.582 --> 00:03:05.264]  Now it's a government site, the president's transition site.
[00:03:06.076 --> 00:03:12.842]  And the Obama Kool-Aid drinkers are behaving just like Bush Kool-Aid drinkers.
[00:03:12.842 --> 00:03:32.618]  When we posted the fact last Friday, and then it got picked up all over the nation by other blogs, that his website was calling for mandatory military service and mandatory domestic squads, which is just a continuation of the Clinton and Bush policies,
[00:03:33.835 --> 00:03:36.337]  Just now with a different spin on it.
[00:03:36.337 --> 00:03:46.743]  They went on the Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com stories about it that Curt Nemo and Paul Watson wrote and said it wasn't true and said we were liars.
[00:03:46.743 --> 00:03:53.887]  And then I guess to match that with their delusional reality, reality was edited or the matrix was altered
[00:03:54.685 --> 00:04:03.268]  And it was memory hold, and every major page of change.gov was altered, including the lines about it being mandatory.
[00:04:03.268 --> 00:04:13.571]  But Google Cache, the Wayback Machine, and other sites that save the web, they at least save prominent sites, we were able to get that.
[00:04:13.571 --> 00:04:20.873]  And they accused us in that article, and on liberal blogs where they posted our story, of manufacturing the screenshots.
[00:04:22.313 --> 00:04:23.334]  Come on!
[00:04:23.334 --> 00:04:25.855]  Why are you willfully delusional?
[00:04:25.855 --> 00:04:35.821]  Why don't you admit that slavery is in vogue now, and that a blackface is bringing it to America, and that he's a frontman, and that he's a puppet?
[00:04:37.458 --> 00:04:42.600]  No, instead, you're going to deny everything, just like George Bush supporters did.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:49.042]  I've had them come up to me in a gun shop and say, you're lying about him supporting the assault weapons ban, you know, with Bush.
[00:04:49.042 --> 00:04:50.403]  And I just don't even argue with them.
[00:04:50.403 --> 00:04:52.643]  I go, just fine, I'm lying.
[00:04:52.643 --> 00:04:55.124]  Just believe whatever you want.
[00:04:55.124 --> 00:04:56.805]  We'll be right back with this and a lot more.
[00:04:56.805 --> 00:04:59.006]  Huge broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:04:59.006 --> 00:04:59.486]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:02.629]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:07.396]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:05:07.396 --> 00:05:10.360]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.404]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:05:13.404 --> 00:05:18.131]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:05:18.331 --> 00:05:19.512]  If you simply prepare.
[00:05:19.512 --> 00:05:23.255]  Our elective representatives wanted a good ol' boy bailout for special interest.
[00:05:23.255 --> 00:05:25.316]  So they ignored your screams not to do it.
[00:05:25.316 --> 00:05:27.158]  They turned off the telephones and email.
[00:05:27.158 --> 00:05:31.121]  They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air.
[00:05:31.121 --> 00:05:33.943]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[00:05:33.943 --> 00:05:40.147]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities.
[00:05:40.147 --> 00:05:43.090]  Particularly food, beyond many Americans reach.
[00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.553]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days.
[00:05:47.813 --> 00:05:50.155]  Until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[00:05:50.155 --> 00:05:54.618]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast, there seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[00:05:54.618 --> 00:06:00.302]  The private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[00:06:00.302 --> 00:06:03.544]  The stores have less food, but jack up prices to stay in business.
[00:06:03.544 --> 00:06:06.686]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[00:06:06.886 --> 00:06:08.708]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[00:06:08.708 --> 00:06:12.792]  One-third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[00:06:12.792 --> 00:06:16.916]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food.
[00:06:16.916 --> 00:06:24.463]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the new old order, has a lot less control over you.
[00:06:24.463 --> 00:06:28.407]  And so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[00:06:28.407 --> 00:06:31.270]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:38.613]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:06:38.613 --> 00:06:41.874]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:06:41.874 --> 00:06:42.794]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:06:42.794 --> 00:06:47.036]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.

[00:06:58.382 --> 00:06:59.043]  Take action today.
[00:06:59.043 --> 00:07:00.864]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:07:13.203 --> 00:07:14.504]  Big Brother.
[00:07:14.504 --> 00:07:16.264]  Mainstream media.
[00:07:16.264 --> 00:07:18.025]  Government cover-ups.
[00:07:18.025 --> 00:07:19.605]  You want answers?
[00:07:19.605 --> 00:07:21.166]  Well, so does he.
[00:07:21.166 --> 00:07:25.367]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:07:25.367 --> 00:07:29.409]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:51.887]  Just in case you joined us, Alan Watts coming up in 52 minutes, Gary Franchi of In The Fed National Protest, Ralph Nader and Larry Pratt today.
[00:07:51.887 --> 00:08:00.913]  That is our eclectic and truly thought-provoking and diverse panel that we'll be speaking with today.
[00:08:00.913 --> 00:08:05.936]  We are going to cover a host of other issues as well.
[00:08:07.862 --> 00:08:13.286]  Namely, the Banking Takeover Part Deuce.
[00:08:13.286 --> 00:08:24.493]  Part 2 that we're now going to be witnessing, and I on the treadmill today watched 35 plus minutes of Henry Paulson's press conference.
[00:08:24.493 --> 00:08:27.936]  All lies, all deceit, all spin.
[00:08:27.936 --> 00:08:35.121]  Just everything was complete lies if you actually spend any time studying what they're saying and doing.
[00:08:35.121 --> 00:08:36.802]  So I want to get into Paulson.
[00:08:38.158 --> 00:08:42.259]  As well, I've got a bunch of other GMO news.
[00:08:42.259 --> 00:08:49.542]  They have studied universities, industry, the companies themselves like Monsanto and ConAgra and others.
[00:08:49.542 --> 00:09:05.867]  They have studied their own GMO foods and every major GMO that is cross-species gene spliced food has a sterilizing effect on the males and females that eat it.
[00:09:06.863 --> 00:09:12.347]  Just across the board, it hurts all life forms.
[00:09:12.347 --> 00:09:32.462]  Hurts mammals, hurts insects, and it's a whole bunch of German and British and Dutch and Chinese studies out that just one particular type, but it's grown all over the world, and it just so happens wherever you have corn growth belts, you find that corn being grown, that's where you'll have total bee die out.
[00:09:33.624 --> 00:09:35.985]  Two billion bees died this year alone in England.
[00:09:35.985 --> 00:09:39.286]  That was most of their bees.
[00:09:39.286 --> 00:09:48.988]  It is the GMO corn that produces a pesticide in the plant itself so bugs don't eat it.
[00:09:48.988 --> 00:09:52.049]  Hey, what a great system!
[00:09:52.049 --> 00:10:02.212]  It just so happens that most types of insects, grasshoppers, weevils, things like that, they won't eat the poison corn.
[00:10:03.433 --> 00:10:06.474]  But honeybees will.
[00:10:06.474 --> 00:10:14.856]  So the honeybee comes by and gets some pollen off the pollinating corn and bye-bye, bye-bye honeybee.
[00:10:14.856 --> 00:10:15.916]  But it's not just the honeybees.
[00:10:15.916 --> 00:10:18.036]  You may not care about the honeybees.
[00:10:18.036 --> 00:10:26.098]  You can sit back and laugh and giggle and snicker about it, but you had better care about your own reproductive system.
[00:10:26.098 --> 00:10:28.619]  And by the way, that's just on that level.
[00:10:28.619 --> 00:10:32.840]  The association of GMO with diabetes and the rat and guinea pig and rabbit studies.
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.021]  And monkey studies.
[00:10:36.021 --> 00:10:37.962]  Primate studies.
[00:10:37.962 --> 00:10:40.324]  The association with cancers.
[00:10:40.324 --> 00:10:44.687]  With, uh, gastrointestinal disorders.
[00:10:44.687 --> 00:10:46.909]  I mean, all of these things are off the charts now.
[00:10:46.909 --> 00:10:50.171]  Thousands of percentile in increases.
[00:10:50.171 --> 00:11:03.460]  And, you know, if that doesn't get you the fluoride does, and if that doesn't get you the mercury does, and if that doesn't get you the barium, salt, and aluminum dioxide being sprayed, now admitted in a worldwide weather modification program to save the Earth from climate change!
[00:11:06.112 --> 00:11:07.293]  That's just the cover.
[00:11:07.293 --> 00:11:16.537]  That's what they tell the well-meaning environmental wacko, cultist, or religious cult members that work at these facilities where they load the fuel with it.
[00:11:16.537 --> 00:11:17.697]  Oh, God help us.
[00:11:17.697 --> 00:11:23.079]  Meanwhile, they're about to start taxing the air we breathe and exhale, calling it a toxic waste.
[00:11:23.079 --> 00:11:29.642]  That'll absorb the entire legitimate environmental movement and make it all about regulating humans, controlling our industrial output.
[00:11:29.642 --> 00:11:33.324]  Obama's all over TV yesterday and today saying, we've got to get our industry going again.
[00:11:34.835 --> 00:11:41.497]  When he is supported, and his party is supported, and his chief of staff is the guy that rammed through, he was the ramrodder.
[00:11:41.497 --> 00:11:44.599]  He was the honcho.
[00:11:44.599 --> 00:11:48.120]  That's why his own is the pit bull.
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.020]  Rambo.
[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:53.642]  On getting after Ram through, remember Bill Clinton?
[00:11:53.642 --> 00:11:54.362]  And Al Gore.
[00:11:54.362 --> 00:12:00.904]  Remember Al Gore making fun of Ross Perot on Larry King Live?
[00:12:00.904 --> 00:12:02.505]  And because Al Gore laughed at him,
[00:12:04.731 --> 00:12:09.174]  Some of the public got fooled and said, oh, he laughed at him, and NAFTA must be good.
[00:12:09.174 --> 00:12:11.095]  But they would have you believe it fooled the public.
[00:12:11.095 --> 00:12:11.856]  It didn't.
[00:12:11.856 --> 00:12:16.839]  When that thing finally passed, what was it, 80-something percent of the public in the polls was against it?
[00:12:16.839 --> 00:12:22.062]  They don't care.
[00:12:22.062 --> 00:12:27.065]  So, Barack Obama is running around saying he wants to get our industry going again.
[00:12:27.065 --> 00:12:29.607]  Do you know what a carbon tax is going to do?
[00:12:29.607 --> 00:12:30.827]  Do you know what cap and trade is going to do?
[00:12:30.827 --> 00:12:33.369]  Do you know what an attack on the coal plants
[00:12:34.466 --> 00:12:35.646]  All these fools go good.
[00:12:35.646 --> 00:12:39.047]  Those rich evil coal companies, they deserve to go out of business.
[00:12:39.047 --> 00:12:42.348]  I hope Obama bankrupts them.
[00:12:42.348 --> 00:12:44.309]  Yeah.
[00:12:44.309 --> 00:12:44.889]  Oh really?
[00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:50.971]  About 50%, 49% is the specific number, the exact number.
[00:12:50.971 --> 00:12:52.771]  49% of all power in the U.S.
[00:12:52.771 --> 00:13:02.354]  That's electrical power to every type of factory, business, restaurant, school, church, car dealership, shopping malls.
[00:13:04.091 --> 00:13:05.492]  Everything.
[00:13:05.492 --> 00:13:11.314]  Golf courses, tennis courts, pools, your house.
[00:13:11.314 --> 00:13:21.818]  They knock that out, you're going to see energy easily double in prices, on top of all the inflation.
[00:13:21.818 --> 00:13:28.881]  And so we can never adjust to what they do, that's why every year they jack up the price, then lower it, then jack it up and lower it, so that clean burning
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.583]  Systems don't get developed and deployed into the market on their own.
[00:13:33.583 --> 00:13:36.926]  They let markets build up and they knock the feet out from under them.
[00:13:36.926 --> 00:13:40.929]  Same thing with ethanol, same thing with biodiesel.
[00:13:40.929 --> 00:13:41.629]  They're slick.
[00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:45.132]  They manage the world's economy.
[00:13:45.132 --> 00:13:46.994]  And if you think they're managing it now, get ready.
[00:13:46.994 --> 00:13:53.399]  But I... For the sake of argument, for the sake of being adults, for those that believe that global warming... Well, now they admit it in global warming.
[00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:56.141]  Now they say it's getting cold again, so... Climate change.
[00:13:56.141 --> 00:13:57.002]  Can't have climate change.
[00:13:57.811 --> 00:14:01.553]  The Earth naturally has climate change.
[00:14:01.553 --> 00:14:09.096]  Warmer, historically, according to anthropologists and biologists and archaeologists, is better for life forms on average.
[00:14:09.096 --> 00:14:12.438]  Better for crop yields.
[00:14:12.438 --> 00:14:18.921]  But let's just say that man-made global warming is real and it's just going to kill us all.
[00:14:18.921 --> 00:14:20.321]  We're all dead.
[00:14:20.321 --> 00:14:24.183]  We all saw that Hollywood movie, Day After Tomorrow, and it's all true.
[00:14:25.723 --> 00:14:28.624]  And we're all dead, if we don't accept world government and taxation.
[00:14:28.624 --> 00:14:52.991]  How is moving what's left of industry in Europe, the United States and Japan, moving that to China and India and Mexico, and 160 other countries that are exempt, which all the major studies that are out there, and we've linked to them on the websites, that will increase the amount of carbon dioxide, because it will leave a nation that already has a lot of cleaner burning systems,
[00:14:54.181 --> 00:15:00.567]  And that will move it to countries with no controls, who have said on record they will never adopt it and the UN doesn't intend for them to adopt it.
[00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:05.651]  Because it's about moving the industry further de-industrializing the West so we can be controlled.
[00:15:05.651 --> 00:15:06.952]  It's feudalism, serfdom.
[00:15:06.952 --> 00:15:10.695]  It's a management system.
[00:15:10.695 --> 00:15:15.139]  They don't want upwardly mobile, self-sufficient, independent people.
[00:15:15.139 --> 00:15:20.704]  That's stated in all the major globalist UN, Club of Rome, CFR documents.
[00:15:22.612 --> 00:15:28.233]  So, what is it you can't get about that simple fact I just stated?
[00:15:28.233 --> 00:15:37.295]  You are so wedded, just like Republicans on talk radio still say WMDs were found in Iraq and still say Saddam carried out 9-11.
[00:15:37.295 --> 00:15:44.297]  I mean, even if you believe the official fairy tale that 19 guys from a cave did it, even people that
[00:15:45.131 --> 00:15:48.172]  Still believe that major overall fairytale.
[00:15:48.172 --> 00:15:52.093]  Most people don't believe the fairytale that's admitted by the government to not be true.
[00:15:52.093 --> 00:15:55.253]  That Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with it.
[00:15:55.253 --> 00:16:00.555]  But still, around 30%, you can go pull this up.
[00:16:00.555 --> 00:16:12.398]  Just Google... I know I've seen the headlines from before the numbers went down of 54% of America still believes Saddam carried out 9-11.
[00:16:12.398 --> 00:16:13.078]  But you know, type in 35%.
[00:16:15.387 --> 00:16:18.929]  Still believe Saddam involved in 9-11.
[00:16:18.929 --> 00:16:19.890]  And you'll see the articles.
[00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:25.933]  The point is, everything I say, you can pull up.
[00:16:25.933 --> 00:16:29.735]  Well, just like you've got the Democrats, because that's one of their policies.
[00:16:29.735 --> 00:16:32.436]  That's part of their little religious cult.
[00:16:32.436 --> 00:16:35.058]  That's part of their fake belief system.
[00:16:35.058 --> 00:16:42.782]  That's how they get accepted at the tea house, or the coffee house, or acting trendy, you know, down at the Unitarian Church, or whatever.
[00:16:42.782 --> 00:16:44.203]  Or at the local atheist hangout.
[00:16:45.422 --> 00:16:49.805]  Uh, is that, oh my gosh, we've got climate change, we've gotta restrict carbon dioxide.
[00:16:49.805 --> 00:16:55.169]  The UN's own report said man-made carbon dioxide accounted for 6% of the increase.
[00:16:55.169 --> 00:16:58.652]  Not 6% of the total, 6% of the increase.
[00:16:58.652 --> 00:17:08.258]  And then all these top scientists and climatologists and ice core specialists and solar experts have gone and discredited that, and the UN's had to back off of that and said, okay, it's 2%.
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.822]  But see, people don't read UN documents.
[00:17:13.822 --> 00:17:15.543]  They don't read what's really being said.
[00:17:15.543 --> 00:17:20.347]  They just... It's on the Weather Channel, it's on TV, every nature show.
[00:17:20.347 --> 00:17:40.201]  I can't even let my children watch a nature show because it's all about humans are bad, and all the animals are dying, and global warming's evil, and these evil caterpillars are eating oak trees because of climate change, and... I mean, I watched like 20 minutes of TV with my wife last night, laying in bed.
[00:17:41.311 --> 00:17:43.092]  We just said, oh, let's watch a little TV, turn it on.
[00:17:43.092 --> 00:17:52.315]  And we were watching PBS or something, and it was these, it was like in the Netherlands, these evil caterpillars eating oak trees.
[00:17:52.315 --> 00:17:53.755]  And it said, they're scary.
[00:17:53.755 --> 00:17:56.456]  They slither up the side and eat the leaves.
[00:17:56.456 --> 00:18:03.338]  Of course, they're indigenous from there, and that's what they do.
[00:18:03.338 --> 00:18:08.440]  But it said, scary and slimy, and what were they called?
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.641]  Procession pillars.
[00:18:11.932 --> 00:18:13.734]  The Procession Caterpillar.
[00:18:13.734 --> 00:18:40.436]  And it was just like, and it would play like music, like, NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:46.823]  Every time they went to break and came back, they would have like 50 TVs flashing in the background and strobe lights going.
[00:18:46.823 --> 00:18:48.243]  It was all about mind control.
[00:18:48.243 --> 00:18:49.624]  Alright, alright.
[00:18:49.624 --> 00:18:55.126]  I'm gonna get into Alan Greenspan arrogantly on the Laird NewsHour.
[00:18:55.126 --> 00:18:56.767]  Openly saying what we've said for years.
[00:18:56.767 --> 00:19:00.829]  The Federal Reserve can do whatever it wants and is beholden to no one.
[00:19:01.904 --> 00:19:07.567]  And we'll get into the new Bretton Woods World Government Takeover set for this weekend.
[00:19:07.567 --> 00:19:08.408]  Stay with us.

[00:19:17.613 --> 00:19:21.936]  Studies show 45% of violent crimes happen after dark.
[00:19:21.936 --> 00:19:28.560]  No matter where you are, being unprepared in the wrong place at the wrong time can be extremely dangerous.

[00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:15.397]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:21:15.397 --> 00:21:18.040]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.601]  But who is the enemy?
[00:21:19.601 --> 00:21:20.382]  Bin Laden.
[00:21:20.382 --> 00:21:21.243]  This is his ammo.
[00:21:21.243 --> 00:21:22.785]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:21:22.785 --> 00:21:24.206]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:21:24.747 --> 00:21:31.893]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:21:31.893 --> 00:21:32.374]  Some U.S.
[00:21:32.374 --> 00:21:38.720]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.183]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:21:42.423 --> 00:21:52.688]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:21:52.688 --> 00:21:53.928]  Fabled enemies.

[00:22:20.096 --> 00:22:21.557]  Here is why.

[00:22:31.983 --> 00:22:34.724]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[00:22:34.724 --> 00:22:36.845]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[00:22:36.845 --> 00:22:37.825]  this fall?
[00:22:37.825 --> 00:22:38.765]  Don't wait.

[00:23:13.581 --> 00:23:16.343]  We're here live.
[00:23:16.343 --> 00:23:20.965]  It is the 12th day now.
[00:23:20.965 --> 00:23:23.747]  Wow, time is really flying.
[00:23:25.365 --> 00:23:27.345]  The 12th day on this Wednesday.
[00:23:27.345 --> 00:23:34.447]  2008, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:34.447 --> 00:23:35.967]  And Ralph Nader's coming up.
[00:23:35.967 --> 00:23:38.228]  Alan Watt, Gary Franchi.
[00:23:38.228 --> 00:23:40.748]  More on the Second Amendment with Larry Pratt.
[00:23:40.748 --> 00:23:47.270]  That's the lineup for you today.
[00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:51.591]  Alright, I watched pretty much all of Henry Paulson's press conference today.
[00:23:54.151 --> 00:24:08.323]  And it was just a bunch of gobbledygook, fake financial numbers thrown out, terms thrown out, lies like the economy's great, everything's fixed, everything's back on track.
[00:24:08.323 --> 00:24:20.633]  He kept saying total transparency by the Treasury and the Federal Reserve, total transparency by federal agencies, total transparency to Congress and the American people.
[00:24:22.739 --> 00:24:27.143]  Total checks and balances and protections for the taxpayers.
[00:24:27.143 --> 00:24:41.214]  Meanwhile, two weeks ago, they gave Congress blacked-out documents on hundreds of billions of dollars handed out to private banks, and then the tens of billions of dollars in fees for brokerage firms to hand the money out for the government.
[00:24:41.214 --> 00:24:50.102]  No discussion of the head person running this, Kashkari, is the gopher and lieutenant, the protege of Paulson, also of Goldman Sachs.
[00:24:51.367 --> 00:24:59.891]  They're now adding to the Federal Reserve, one of the people that employed one of the brokerage firms and looted it, which is a total insider free-for-all.
[00:24:59.891 --> 00:25:13.096]  They admit that major brokerage firms like Goldman Sachs are taking, all total globally, more than $50 billion of bailout money and giving that to their executives as bonuses.
[00:25:13.096 --> 00:25:14.137]  And they said that!
[00:25:14.137 --> 00:25:15.517]  That's in the British News.
[00:25:15.517 --> 00:25:16.598]  You know, $14 million, £7 million in
[00:25:20.626 --> 00:25:22.067]  The U.S.
[00:25:22.067 --> 00:25:23.647]  $25 billion plus.
[00:25:23.647 --> 00:25:25.748]  I mean, it's just all right there in the news.
[00:25:25.748 --> 00:25:28.029]  Just in bonuses for themselves.
[00:25:28.029 --> 00:25:33.070]  They are directly taking the money and bragging to the New York Times, oh, we're not really in trouble.
[00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:46.135]  We're going to buy up good banks and good assets and then just let all the other smaller banks fail and then we'll use regulators in the government who take those over and then hand them to us with all the assets of the banks.
[00:25:46.135 --> 00:25:48.776]  I mean, this is just crime at every level.
[00:25:51.391 --> 00:25:53.592]  Unless people get confused.
[00:25:53.592 --> 00:26:01.373]  Earlier I was talking about looking up the number of Americans that still believe, changing subjects, that Saddam had WMDs.
[00:26:01.373 --> 00:26:09.515]  I was saying that previously, in the first few years of 9-11, it was something like 55% remember thought Saddam.
[00:26:09.515 --> 00:26:13.396]  The headline was more than half of Americans believe Saddam involved in 9-11.
[00:26:13.396 --> 00:26:19.018]  Then I'm saying today you can Google it and it's, last time I saw it, like 30%
[00:26:20.742 --> 00:26:21.982]  I think that was about six months ago.
[00:26:21.982 --> 00:26:32.365]  The reason I digress and get back into 9-11 is because somebody sent me an email this morning going, Aha!
[00:26:32.365 --> 00:26:33.525]  You're a liar!
[00:26:33.525 --> 00:26:37.766]  I went out to Robert Mueller Airport and it's a shopping mall and a movie studio.
[00:26:37.766 --> 00:26:39.927]  There's no FEMA camp out there.
[00:26:39.927 --> 00:26:42.387]  You're a liar!
[00:26:42.387 --> 00:26:44.988]  And I had remembered seeing that on a YouTube comment.
[00:26:45.762 --> 00:26:52.105]  It's got a half a million views up there, the little video excerpt of myself two months before 9-11 predicting it.
[00:26:52.105 --> 00:26:56.247]  And I just so happened to see a comment there saying the same thing, so it must be the same guy.
[00:26:56.247 --> 00:26:59.488]  Hey, if you want to believe that, go ahead.
[00:26:59.488 --> 00:27:09.313]  You want to believe I'm a liar and play mental games and falsify reality so you can say you're right, be my guest.
[00:27:09.313 --> 00:27:11.674]  I have the video myself
[00:27:13.035 --> 00:27:20.517]  of the security guard saying don't videotape this building and get out of here.
[00:27:20.517 --> 00:27:36.862]  They put in bolts and chains and barbed wire inside and then I called the local news about it and local Fox did a news piece and said that it was an emergency federally paid for holding center during civil unrest.
[00:27:37.771 --> 00:27:46.373]  Just like in Denver, they built a secret camp and told reporters that it wasn't a camp, and then got caught lying about it.
[00:27:46.373 --> 00:27:54.355]  Just like Pier 57 in New York was secret, and federally paid for, and they kept more than 2,000 people in it.
[00:27:54.355 --> 00:28:02.597]  Inside barbed wire fences, sitting in the 75-year-old bus terminal, and all those chemicals and oil on the floor.
[00:28:02.597 --> 00:28:06.378]  So, Pier 57 exists, the secret camp in Denver exists,
[00:28:07.003 --> 00:28:09.324]  The one out at Mueller, I haven't checked in two years.
[00:28:09.324 --> 00:28:11.426]  Two years ago, they still had the hangar.
[00:28:11.426 --> 00:28:12.446]  It's a big airport.
[00:28:12.446 --> 00:28:14.427]  It's a shutdown airport.
[00:28:14.427 --> 00:28:15.308]  It's a big airport.
[00:28:15.308 --> 00:28:28.716]  It's a 747 hangar, and they made it into a makeshift relocation facility, and that's been on the news, and you can lie all day long and say it doesn't exist, but it does.
[00:28:30.885 --> 00:28:33.106]  Again, this is the denial I deal with.
[00:28:33.106 --> 00:28:40.670]  The Army admits they have secret civilian inmate labor camps that were secret from 10 years to 86 to 96 when they declassified it.
[00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:42.892]  That's even on the Wikipedia page.
[00:28:42.892 --> 00:28:45.573]  It's on the army.mil website.
[00:28:45.573 --> 00:28:50.336]  And then now they've expanded it to 24 camps, and it's no longer secret.
[00:28:50.336 --> 00:28:52.917]  And they're building more camps for the American people.
[00:28:52.917 --> 00:28:57.940]  And you can just say it's not true all day long, but, you know, reality's still there.
[00:28:58.675 --> 00:29:02.600]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:05.303]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:08.699 --> 00:29:11.140]  Imagine feeling totally helpless.
[00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:17.424]  Imagine thinking and hearing clearly, but unable to move as the ground rises to meet you.
[00:29:17.424 --> 00:29:27.029]  Imagine the pain of a thousand needles as your body is invaded, locked, and hammered by 50,000 volts of the latest in taser technology.
[00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:34.553]  If this sounds scary, imagine how it would feel for anyone attempting to victimize a friend, loved one, or even yourself.

[00:30:08.855 --> 00:30:22.010]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.

[00:31:08.553 --> 00:31:10.314]  Honey, have you seen the remote?
[00:31:10.314 --> 00:31:12.535]  Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?
[00:31:12.535 --> 00:31:14.315]  I can't find my wallet!
[00:31:14.315 --> 00:31:15.156]  Sound familiar?
[00:31:15.156 --> 00:31:18.617]  Why not save time looking for lost things and lose the stress instead?

[00:32:02.079 --> 00:32:02.440]  We're good.
[00:32:22.526 --> 00:32:24.126]  You know what's on the agenda?
[00:32:24.126 --> 00:32:34.889]  Gun control, total amnesty, North American Union ID cards already being advertised and given out to the public by the feds.
[00:32:34.889 --> 00:32:35.889]  You know what's coming.
[00:32:35.889 --> 00:32:42.891]  It's just going to be a free-for-all, a hundred-day march, an orgy of foreign banker looting.
[00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:59.293]  Coming up this weekend, now, again, we know that at the Bilderberg Group meeting three meetings ago, two and a half years ago, in Ottawa, Canada, from our sources inside, that they were going to implode the subprime mortgage first.
[00:32:59.293 --> 00:33:03.877]  That way they could blame it on the public and say the public was responsible.
[00:33:03.877 --> 00:33:07.840]  That key psychological position
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:30.773]  And that they would then cut off liquidity worldwide, cause a massive slowdown in the world economic system, Main Street grinding to a halt, and the bankers would grandstand and fearmonger and say, out of this crisis we've got to have a new order, we've got to punish the corrupt financial institutions, and how do they do that?
[00:33:30.773 --> 00:33:33.935]  By giving themselves tens of trillions globally of taxpayer money,
[00:33:35.314 --> 00:33:44.579]  And of setting up an expanded world regulatory body run by the very institutions, the very private banks.
[00:33:44.579 --> 00:33:46.620]  And I watched Paulson this morning.
[00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:49.601]  He kept saying, we apologize to the world.
[00:33:49.601 --> 00:33:52.083]  We are so sorry for what we have done.
[00:33:52.083 --> 00:33:54.264]  America is so bad.
[00:33:54.264 --> 00:33:55.304]  We are terrible.
[00:33:55.304 --> 00:33:56.325]  I mean, over.
[00:33:56.325 --> 00:33:58.546]  I mean, he probably said it six, seven times.
[00:33:58.546 --> 00:34:00.507]  My mouth was hanging open.
[00:34:00.507 --> 00:34:02.548]  We apologize to Europe.
[00:34:02.548 --> 00:34:04.089]  We apologize to the world.
[00:34:05.556 --> 00:34:10.297]  We shouldn't have given these bad loans to these people that didn't have money.
[00:34:10.297 --> 00:34:13.598]  It's the American people's fault and it's our bank's fault.
[00:34:13.598 --> 00:34:17.158]  Meanwhile, the banks are really offshore and setting up world government.
[00:34:17.158 --> 00:34:19.859]  So, we're sorry, we're going to pay for it.
[00:34:19.859 --> 00:34:21.779]  That means the American people.
[00:34:21.779 --> 00:34:23.980]  Your tax money to give them all the cash.
[00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:26.020]  Which isn't even used to unfreeze the markets.
[00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:30.981]  They want the markets frozen so they can drive down the prices of the real economy to buy it up.
[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:41.529]  This is really very simple, and I tell full-grown business majors this stuff, and they can't understand me.
[00:34:41.529 --> 00:34:46.174]  I tell people that I have degrees.
[00:34:46.174 --> 00:34:54.442]  But again, their degrees aren't a bunch of fake flim-flam, and their degrees are only within a very narrow spectrum of the real economic system.
[00:34:57.327 --> 00:35:00.368]  They analyze only a very limited area.
[00:35:00.368 --> 00:35:01.929]  I mean, here's the parallel.
[00:35:01.929 --> 00:35:03.649]  It's like the ocean.
[00:35:03.649 --> 00:35:14.373]  You've got the surface area for the first hundred feet or so, then you've got the twilight zone, then you've got the dark zone.
[00:35:14.373 --> 00:35:23.756]  Well, they just inhabit a few feet of one of those zones, instead of wide-spectrum analysis.
[00:35:26.289 --> 00:35:33.234]  I mean, a lot of mainline business majors will tell you the Federal Reserve is governmental.
[00:35:33.234 --> 00:35:35.935]  They will claim it is accountable to the Treasury.
[00:35:35.935 --> 00:35:40.618]  They will tell you it is accountable to the Congress.
[00:35:40.618 --> 00:35:41.819]  And that's not true!
[00:35:41.819 --> 00:35:52.426]  The President appoints the decade-plus long term of a Fed Chairman.
[00:35:52.426 --> 00:35:55.748]  But the rest of the Fed Board of Governors is completely private.
[00:35:56.790 --> 00:36:07.281]  And they run and control the economy, they run and control the president, so the president always appoints who they want, whether it's Volcker, or whether it's Greenspan, or now Bernanke.
[00:36:07.281 --> 00:36:09.744]  And they see us as dumb animals that deserve to be slaves.
[00:36:09.744 --> 00:36:13.167]  It's funny to them!
[00:36:13.167 --> 00:36:19.334]  And so just like 30% of the public or more thinks Saddam carried out 9-11 still, even though the government admits he didn't,
[00:36:21.019 --> 00:36:33.348]  You've got a large portion of the public that can't admit they were lied to, so they will continue to say the Federal Reserve is government and the Federal Reserve is beholden to Congress.
[00:36:33.348 --> 00:36:42.234]  And they will continue to say that Barack Obama is changing what's happening with Wall Street and gonna fix it when he is their man.
[00:36:42.234 --> 00:36:46.837]  They're Pied Piper to con the public long enough for the New World Order to openly be set up.
[00:36:48.542 --> 00:36:50.804]  And what did we always tell you for decades it would be?
[00:36:50.804 --> 00:36:54.227]  Because the globalists told us in their own think tank documents?
[00:36:54.227 --> 00:37:10.522]  It would be, after a world economic crisis, they engineered, they said they would do it, and then they would set up a world regulatory body over all the currencies and stock markets and financial transactions, and then you would pay an environmental tax on everything you do.
[00:37:11.645 --> 00:37:21.516]  Hundreds of new taxes per country, and a percentage will be paid to the private inner group of banks, making them finally openly government.
[00:37:21.516 --> 00:37:33.629]  So it isn't the government taking over the banks, it's a private group of banks taking over the rest of the free market, other financial institutions, insurance companies, brokerage firms, credit unions, and the real economy, and the government.
[00:37:37.467 --> 00:37:46.409]  And you're going to see them at this new Bretton Woods 2 agree on a set of quote, reforms to quote, fix things.
[00:37:46.409 --> 00:37:51.450]  And then they'll plunge the market even more and say, see, we need this right now.
[00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:53.030]  Accept this right now.
[00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:55.711]  And the public will say, no, we're not for it.
[00:37:55.711 --> 00:37:58.551]  And then they'll go on TV and say, the public says they're for it.
[00:37:58.551 --> 00:37:59.551]  Good.
[00:37:59.551 --> 00:38:07.093]  We'll now go to a basket of currencies run by these private banks and they will regulate the United States and Europe and the world.
[00:38:09.841 --> 00:38:15.063]  And they will have a list of demands for the United States just like they've had for hundreds of third world countries.
[00:38:15.063 --> 00:38:29.069]  It's the IMF World Bank list of over 100 demands and it will be privatize your water districts, your school districts, your government, your police, your power companies, your roads, everything.
[00:38:31.041 --> 00:38:32.261]  Now, that'll be on that end.
[00:38:32.261 --> 00:38:34.162]  The companies will pay nothing.
[00:38:34.162 --> 00:38:41.744]  They will just be given everything, and then you will still pay taxes to government and to the private banks and fees.
[00:38:41.744 --> 00:38:46.126]  And then, on average, your service will triple.
[00:38:46.126 --> 00:38:49.467]  Water, trash pickup, just watch.
[00:38:49.467 --> 00:38:51.047]  Roads, everything.
[00:38:51.047 --> 00:38:51.688]  Everything.
[00:38:51.688 --> 00:38:58.830]  They are going to squeeze you and squeeze you and squeeze you until it's like Argentina that was first world, where middle class people, by the millions, are living on the streets.
[00:38:59.622 --> 00:39:01.603]  And it's eight years after that control collapse.
[00:39:01.603 --> 00:39:02.743]  They're still there.
[00:39:02.743 --> 00:39:03.263]  They like it.
[00:39:03.263 --> 00:39:06.944]  They like flying over in helicopters and seeing people in shanty towns.
[00:39:06.944 --> 00:39:09.545]  They enjoy hurting families.
[00:39:09.545 --> 00:39:11.005]  They enjoy control.
[00:39:11.005 --> 00:39:12.846]  It's about dominance.
[00:39:12.846 --> 00:39:17.247]  It's like a dog hiking its leg and urinating on a smaller dog.
[00:39:17.247 --> 00:39:18.187]  Or a cowed dog.
[00:39:18.187 --> 00:39:23.469]  A lot of times the little dog can cow the big dog because it just doesn't believe in itself.
[00:39:23.469 --> 00:39:24.009]  That's like us.
[00:39:25.269 --> 00:39:34.012]  Hiking their leg, appointing foreigners and dual citizens to run the White House, just hiking the leg, urinating on you.
[00:39:34.012 --> 00:39:52.940]  And then going on TV with Paulson and saying, you deserve this, you did this, America apologizes to the world for what we've done and now we're ready to be punished with economic sanctions like we're Germany after World War I and we've lost some war and we're going to pay reparations.
[00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:53.620]  That's what they're saying.
[00:39:54.528 --> 00:40:01.073]  And so, of course, England and Germany and Russia and Japan and China and Brazil, they all are having economic bailouts.
[00:40:01.073 --> 00:40:03.394]  They're all run by crooks, too.
[00:40:03.394 --> 00:40:07.377]  So they're all, quote, let's bail out the... help the people!
[00:40:07.377 --> 00:40:14.182]  Let's give 565 billion dollars to select Chinese companies and banks from the Chinese taxpayer.
[00:40:14.182 --> 00:40:15.043]  Hooray!
[00:40:15.043 --> 00:40:16.464]  That'll fix it.
[00:40:16.464 --> 00:40:20.607]  Hey, let's give, now, 500 plus billion dollars
[00:40:23.214 --> 00:40:29.258]  You can convert that into pounds to private select banks in England of taxpayer money they'll have to pay back.
[00:40:29.258 --> 00:40:31.379]  Yes!
[00:40:31.379 --> 00:40:34.622]  Let's give six hundred and something billion in Germany.
[00:40:34.622 --> 00:40:35.862]  Yay!
[00:40:35.862 --> 00:40:39.405]  Let's give four hundred and something billion in France to the private bankers.
[00:40:39.405 --> 00:40:46.709]  Yes, that will show them for what they did.
[00:40:46.709 --> 00:40:48.531]  The magnitude of it.
[00:40:48.531 --> 00:40:51.893]  But not only do they get all the money that we have to pay back,
[00:40:52.592 --> 00:41:03.139]  In taxes and inflation, devaluation of currency, but they set up the new order and be the saviors!
[00:41:03.139 --> 00:41:11.104]  Now... Now... This is Alan Greenspan.
[00:41:11.104 --> 00:41:19.870]  He says a lot of other horrible things that clips up on InfoWars.com, but... In fact, John, I don't have a sheet of paper in front of me.
[00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:21.231]  What's the title of the YouTube video?
[00:41:25.182 --> 00:41:27.523]  Were you on air just now?
[00:41:27.523 --> 00:41:28.763]  Okay.
[00:41:28.763 --> 00:41:32.004]  Greenspan admits the Federal Reserve is above the law.
[00:41:32.004 --> 00:41:33.224]  Answers to no one.
[00:41:33.224 --> 00:41:36.265]  Okay, if you want to Google it, there it is.
[00:41:36.265 --> 00:41:41.086]  This is Greenspan on the Laird News Hour.
[00:41:41.086 --> 00:41:47.967]  And he just arrogantly says there's nothing the Congress, nothing the government, nothing anyone can do.
[00:41:47.967 --> 00:41:50.008]  And then he quasi-implies it's governmental.
[00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:52.801]  Now, think about that.
[00:41:52.801 --> 00:41:58.565]  In our government, it's supposed to all be about checks and balances and accountability and transparency.
[00:41:58.565 --> 00:42:08.692]  And the private banks running the world, setting up all these world rules, through world government, global governance, they're always telling us, over and over and over and over again, you've got to be transparent.
[00:42:08.692 --> 00:42:11.134]  We've got to know everything you're doing without a warrant.
[00:42:11.134 --> 00:42:12.675]  We've got to watch your every move.
[00:42:12.675 --> 00:42:17.238]  We've got to watch all these third world countries that are owned by the bankers.
[00:42:17.238 --> 00:42:18.899]  Who made the money out of nothing.
[00:42:18.899 --> 00:42:19.980]  Enforce it with our military.
[00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:23.571]  And then he just says, hey, I can do whatever I want.
[00:42:23.571 --> 00:42:27.853]  There's nothing anyone can do about the Federal Reserve.
[00:42:27.853 --> 00:42:31.054]  The Federal Reserve stands alone and does whatever it wants.
[00:42:31.054 --> 00:42:43.560]  And folks, it is the management arm of Chase Manhattan, Citibank, JPMorgan Chase, Citibank,
[00:42:44.255 --> 00:42:46.517]  Wells Fargo and Bank of America.
[00:42:46.517 --> 00:42:50.280]  Those are the banks that own the Federal Reserve.
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:50.700]  Publicly.
[00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:53.602]  There's been congressional hearings decades ago about it.
[00:42:53.602 --> 00:42:56.985]  And they engineered runs on banks before 1913.
[00:42:56.985 --> 00:42:58.326]  They said, oh, this will fix it.
[00:42:58.326 --> 00:43:01.008]  We'll never have another run on a bank, another crisis.
[00:43:01.008 --> 00:43:05.752]  And then the mother of all crises, they engineered by cutting off liquidity in 29.
[00:43:05.752 --> 00:43:08.314]  It took a full year to get into the depths of the Depression.
[00:43:08.314 --> 00:43:10.035]  They're doing the same thing right now.
[00:43:10.035 --> 00:43:11.777]  And they grandstand again as the saviors.
[00:43:12.788 --> 00:43:17.391]  They were so bold then, they ordered the public to turn their gold into the government.
[00:43:17.391 --> 00:43:18.752]  And the people did it.
[00:43:18.752 --> 00:43:21.413]  And they gave them paper back and then doubled the price of gold a year later.
[00:43:21.413 --> 00:43:26.016]  I mean, there's no end to the level of arrogance.
[00:43:26.016 --> 00:43:29.218]  And here's the deal.
[00:43:29.218 --> 00:43:31.659]  They are going to continue to push and push and push.
[00:43:31.659 --> 00:43:39.844]  As the founding father, George Washington, said, the level of tyranny you will live under is the exact amount you will tolerate.
[00:43:39.844 --> 00:43:41.004]  They will not stop.
[00:43:41.004 --> 00:43:42.005]  They will never quit.
[00:43:42.958 --> 00:43:45.884]  They will never quit pushing until you say no.
[00:43:45.884 --> 00:43:49.050]  And they know the public is cowed and whooped.
[00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:51.194]  And on its back, on its belly, begging.
[00:43:51.194 --> 00:43:52.697]  And they're not going to give us quarter.
[00:43:52.697 --> 00:43:53.859]  So here is this snake.
[00:43:54.508 --> 00:44:02.893]  Who changed the rules to let the private banks issue endless liquidity to buy up real assets and now they're leaving us holding the bag while posing as the saviors.
[00:44:02.893 --> 00:44:09.698]  Here he is saying that they are accountable to no one but themselves and they can do whatever they want.
[00:44:09.698 --> 00:44:19.484]  Now, in the legislation the House passed, they say the Treasury can now join them in the crime and literally merge with the banks.
[00:44:19.484 --> 00:44:21.925]  The banks are taking it over, it's not taking them over.
[00:44:21.925 --> 00:44:22.886]  They have no voting share.
[00:44:25.402 --> 00:44:32.466]  And that they can do whatever they want, and of course they say, we've spent two trillion, we won't tell Congress where it went.
[00:44:32.466 --> 00:44:34.227]  Here's some blacked out documents.
[00:44:34.227 --> 00:44:46.733]  And then he goes on TV today, while publicly saying, in Bloomberg reporting, in AP reporting, that they won't give any of the information out, even to Congress, which is above them, but they say, no you're not.
[00:44:46.733 --> 00:44:49.934]  We have the executive and the military that says they'll back us up.
[00:44:49.934 --> 00:44:50.895]  Sit down and shut up.
[00:44:52.944 --> 00:45:07.393]  He has the nerve, Paulson, to go on TV today and say, this is total transparency, total taxpayer protection, on and on and on, complete lies.
[00:45:07.393 --> 00:45:09.414]  This is a heist in the open.
[00:45:09.414 --> 00:45:10.815]  And they're not going to stop here, folks.
[00:45:10.815 --> 00:45:12.656]  That's why I know they're going for broke.
[00:45:12.656 --> 00:45:14.837]  That's why I'm so disquieted in my soul.
[00:45:14.837 --> 00:45:15.938]  That's why I'm so upset.
[00:45:15.938 --> 00:45:19.860]  You haven't seen, I haven't seen, we haven't seen anything yet.
[00:45:24.225 --> 00:45:28.187]  They're going to make us a total third world country very quickly.
[00:45:28.187 --> 00:45:29.969]  They want you bankrupt.
[00:45:29.969 --> 00:45:31.910]  They want you destitute.
[00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:34.051]  Because then they can really pose as the savior.
[00:45:34.051 --> 00:45:35.572]  And then you'll accept gun control.
[00:45:35.572 --> 00:45:38.194]  Then you'll accept military on the streets because of rioting.
[00:45:38.194 --> 00:45:41.076]  Then you'll accept total tyranny.
[00:45:41.076 --> 00:45:45.699]  This is so cold-blooded and so evil and so greedy and so self-centered.
[00:45:45.699 --> 00:45:47.100]  Let's go ahead and play Alan Greenspan.
[00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:47.821]  It's unbelievable.
[00:45:48.647 --> 00:45:56.915]  What is the proper relationship, what should be the proper relationship between a Chairman of the Fed and a President of the United States?
[00:45:56.915 --> 00:46:10.648]  Well, first of all, the Federal Reserve is an independent agency, and that means basically that there is no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take.
[00:46:12.052 --> 00:46:20.559]  So long as that is in place and there is no evidence that the administration or the Congress or anybody else
[00:46:21.674 --> 00:46:27.678]  I know that you mentioned in the book and everybody knew about it at the time that President George H.W.
[00:46:27.678 --> 00:46:29.399]  Bush blamed you
[00:46:42.726 --> 00:46:45.228]  Partly, at least, for his re-election law.
[00:46:45.228 --> 00:46:46.529]  I think he said fully.
[00:46:46.529 --> 00:46:47.269]  I think fully.
[00:46:47.269 --> 00:46:47.710]  You're right.
[00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:51.392]  I'm just trying to put a... help you out there a little bit.
[00:46:51.392 --> 00:46:57.277]  What is it you did that so... that he... Alright, let's stop right there.
[00:46:57.277 --> 00:46:57.957]  Now, did you hear?
[00:46:57.957 --> 00:46:59.618]  That's why he was made Fed Chairman.
[00:46:59.618 --> 00:47:00.479]  Because he's slick.
[00:47:00.479 --> 00:47:02.460]  That was lawyer talk.
[00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:08.745]  Did you hear Alan Greenspan, the economist, say, we are an independent agency?
[00:47:12.046 --> 00:47:12.807]  An agency.
[00:47:12.807 --> 00:47:14.227]  That goes back to Letter of Mark.
[00:47:14.227 --> 00:47:16.068]  That just means a group hired.
[00:47:16.068 --> 00:47:20.251]  Agencies are really privately hired and organized organizations.
[00:47:20.251 --> 00:47:21.211]  Outside government.
[00:47:21.211 --> 00:47:27.775]  That's why once the Congress commissioned officers, now the military just hires mercenaries, does whatever it wants.
[00:47:27.775 --> 00:47:30.517]  It was all about Congress having the control.
[00:47:30.517 --> 00:47:32.218]  Now you have a private Federal Reserve and he says,
[00:47:33.431 --> 00:47:46.179]  Oh, well, he implies, knowing the population's ignorant semantically to the words he's using, oh, we're an independent agency, we're independent from Congress and the President, we do whatever we want, and that's morally good!
[00:47:46.179 --> 00:47:49.341]  He implied.
[00:47:49.341 --> 00:47:53.824]  And that no one can have oversight, no one can audit them, they've never been audited, no one can look at them.
[00:47:53.824 --> 00:47:56.006]  Oh, that's good!
[00:47:56.006 --> 00:48:02.210]  Oh, yes, just trust you in a black hole guarded by private guards to do whatever you want.
[00:48:02.210 --> 00:48:02.750]  With our money.
[00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:05.601]  And of course, they've robbed us, they're raping us now.
[00:48:05.601 --> 00:48:07.522]  That's what happens.
[00:48:07.522 --> 00:48:08.902]  They just laugh at us.
[00:48:08.902 --> 00:48:14.865]  Then he goes on to say, no agency of government can interfere with us.
[00:48:14.865 --> 00:48:19.528]  So see, then he, first he implies they're a government agency, but he uses the word agency.
[00:48:19.528 --> 00:48:23.850]  Then he says, no agency of government can interfere with us.
[00:48:23.850 --> 00:48:29.212]  So again, semantically implying that they're part of government again.
[00:48:29.212 --> 00:48:32.974]  Now, fraud and criminality, I don't care if you have a contract, I don't care if you got
[00:48:33.726 --> 00:48:34.946]  The Federal Reserve Act.
[00:48:34.946 --> 00:48:36.327]  Congress can repeal that.
[00:48:36.327 --> 00:48:38.748]  Congress can investigate you.
[00:48:38.748 --> 00:48:42.289]  Grand juries can arrest your criminal butt, Alan Greenspan.
[00:48:42.289 --> 00:48:43.829]  You are not the new emperor.
[00:48:43.829 --> 00:48:46.730]  You do not have the divine right of kings.
[00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:52.872]  And that was decided in 1215 at Runnymede that kings are not God.
[00:48:52.872 --> 00:48:55.152]  And that kings can't do whatever they want.
[00:48:55.152 --> 00:48:56.853]  And Richard Nixon isn't a king.
[00:48:56.853 --> 00:48:58.433]  And Bill Clinton isn't a king.
[00:48:58.433 --> 00:49:00.174]  And George W. Bush isn't a king.
[00:49:00.174 --> 00:49:03.455]  And you are not a king, you little criminal.
[00:49:04.511 --> 00:49:07.093]  You little bank-robbing bastard!
[00:49:07.093 --> 00:49:09.615]  And the same goes for Bernanke.
[00:49:09.615 --> 00:49:12.997]  And the same goes for Henry Paulson and the Treasury.
[00:49:12.997 --> 00:49:26.766]  I don't care if you threaten Congress with martial law and said, give us unlimited power, vote us a blank check, hand over your authority to us, sign a congressional treaty with the private Federal Reserve to let them take over.
[00:49:26.766 --> 00:49:29.548]  That's what that bill was.
[00:49:29.548 --> 00:49:33.010]  It's a fraud!
[00:49:33.010 --> 00:49:33.731]  It's abhorrent!
[00:49:34.648 --> 00:49:45.938]  But cops and the public and everybody else have been trained, as long as somebody in a suit says it on TV, and has a blue background behind them, everything's okay.
[00:49:45.938 --> 00:49:48.620]  So we've got to ask, I mean, how far are we going to let them go?
[00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:50.522]  I mean, is two trillion in five weeks enough?
[00:49:51.616 --> 00:49:56.002]  I mean, it's not just the robbing the Treasury.
[00:49:56.002 --> 00:50:03.432]  They're now going to expand their power over our lives and put a carbon tax on everything we do and shut down our factories and farms and ranches?
[00:50:03.432 --> 00:50:04.353]  And take our guns?
[00:50:04.353 --> 00:50:07.056]  I mean, we're going to let them say that's their divine right to do that?
[00:50:07.517 --> 00:50:09.217]  We'll be back with the Youth Brigades.
[00:50:09.217 --> 00:50:11.378]  SurvivalProperty.com.
[00:50:11.378 --> 00:50:17.740]  Longtime survivalist author Ragnar Benson wrote, a survival retreat is a place you go to live, not die.
[00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:23.241]  It is a place out of the mainstream of events that contains the means to survive without outside support.
[00:50:23.241 --> 00:50:30.163]  A place where you find shelter, protection, food, water, medicine, and warmth you prepared for yourself.
[00:50:30.163 --> 00:50:30.623]  It is defense
[00:50:30.663 --> 00:50:31.443]  I don't know.
[00:50:51.790 --> 00:50:55.473]  Something completely impossible for the average American to do.
[00:50:55.473 --> 00:50:57.435]  Act now before it's too late.

[00:51:08.604 --> 00:51:15.389]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:51:15.389 --> 00:51:17.051]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:51:18.011 --> 00:51:19.552]  But who is the enemy?
[00:51:19.552 --> 00:51:20.332]  Bin Laden.
[00:51:20.332 --> 00:51:21.213]  This is his MO.
[00:51:21.213 --> 00:51:22.733]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:51:22.733 --> 00:51:24.714]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:51:24.714 --> 00:51:31.858]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:51:31.858 --> 00:51:32.338]  Some U.S.
[00:51:32.338 --> 00:51:38.701]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:51:38.701 --> 00:51:42.163]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:51:42.403 --> 00:51:52.673]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:51:52.673 --> 00:51:53.914]  Fabled enemies.

[00:52:08.482 --> 00:52:12.185]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[00:52:12.185 --> 00:52:17.931]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[00:52:17.931 --> 00:52:22.274]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[00:52:22.274 --> 00:52:24.717]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[00:52:24.717 --> 00:52:30.702]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures.
[00:52:30.802 --> 00:52:31.523]  We're good to go!
[00:52:47.875 --> 00:52:51.016]  The International Crime Syndicate, the Federal Reserve, are internationalists.
[00:53:18.590 --> 00:53:20.730]  They don't care about running America into the ground.
[00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:23.031]  In fact, they want to.
[00:53:23.031 --> 00:53:31.853]  And CNBC and a lot of other major TV financial channels, Bloomberg, CNN Money, they're all saying the U.S.
[00:53:31.853 --> 00:53:34.473]  will probably lose its AAA rating.
[00:53:34.473 --> 00:53:45.236]  Here was a top brokerage firm out of China, well, German based in China, CNBC, last night, talking about the U.S.
[00:53:45.236 --> 00:53:46.456]  losing its AAA rating.
[00:53:46.456 --> 00:53:46.816]  Here it is.
[00:53:48.596 --> 00:53:59.244]  Martin, I must admit, some of your pretty dire expectations for the U.S., some of them came to pass, and I'm curious as to your thoughts on what needs to happen here in the U.S.
[00:53:59.244 --> 00:54:01.827]  to dig ourselves out of this situation.
[00:54:01.827 --> 00:54:12.115]  Yeah, I'm afraid, you know, I don't see that the U.S., even with another stimulus package, could rescue itself, because most of their industry, industrial capacity, has already been depleted.
[00:54:12.115 --> 00:54:13.416]  It has gone overseas.
[00:54:14.056 --> 00:54:17.297]  I don't think there's much industry really to stimulate back into life.
[00:54:17.297 --> 00:54:25.740]  And the other thing is, unlike China, who do have a lot of cash, who do have very low government debt, and so it's easy for them to splash out some cash.
[00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:35.843]  But in the United States, there's already a funding crisis, and they will have to sell a lot more bonds next year to fund the bailout packages that have already been signed off.
[00:54:35.843 --> 00:54:37.664]  And so I think the U.S.
[00:54:37.664 --> 00:54:40.145]  might be on course to actually lose AAA rating.
[00:54:41.725 --> 00:54:48.090]  A Chairman of Sovereign Ratings for Standard & Poor's has warned that there's a lot of pressure now on the U.S.
[00:54:48.090 --> 00:54:51.212]  AAA rating and you have seen... Let's see, they don't care!
[00:54:51.212 --> 00:54:56.495]  And then they go and talk about big European funds and others, suspending trading of U.S.
[00:54:56.495 --> 00:54:59.017]  securities, because people just aren't buying them now.
[00:54:59.017 --> 00:55:02.059]  They offer them and it's not being bought at auction.
[00:55:02.059 --> 00:55:07.083]  You understand, folks, when more money's created, it has to be sold as debt for people to buy it?
[00:55:07.083 --> 00:55:10.145]  Because we have a private Federal Reserve who sells it and makes the profit?
[00:55:11.595 --> 00:55:28.665]  These private bastard bankers sit there, because they bought off our Congress in 1913, and they sell bonds that we have to pay back in tax money to foreign investors, and then they get the profit from selling them for nothing.
[00:55:30.541 --> 00:55:32.662]  And what do they do for us, letting them have this power?
[00:55:32.662 --> 00:55:33.262]  They rape us!
[00:55:33.262 --> 00:55:48.507]  They set us up, and then blame the American people, and have a Treasury Secretary get up there and blame the American people, and say, we're so sorry America's bad, when these are foreign European banks, the Federal Reserve is mainly European owned, Rothschild owned, and is openly doing this.
[00:55:48.507 --> 00:55:57.090]  And by the way, I see people all over the web making fun of me, saying the Rothschilds don't exist, or if they do, they don't have any power.
[00:55:57.090 --> 00:55:59.171]  The big UAE news article,
[00:56:01.015 --> 00:56:05.037]  In fact, I just had that in my stack and I never got around to it.
[00:56:05.037 --> 00:56:20.163]  Openly said, two days ago, in the United Arab Emirates major national newspaper, in an interview, that they are setting up a world government, and that the Rothschilds basically run large parts of it.
[00:56:20.163 --> 00:56:26.966]  He just says, we're setting up global government, and we're run by banks worldwide, and he called it a new world order.
[00:56:26.966 --> 00:56:30.708]  He said, global government, global governance, new world order, and we run it.
[00:56:32.449 --> 00:56:34.811]  I mean, you've got... In fact, where is it?
[00:56:34.811 --> 00:56:38.173]  I just can't keep track of it anymore.
[00:56:38.173 --> 00:56:45.398]  And then people just sit around and they laugh about all of it.
[00:56:45.398 --> 00:56:46.338]  I'm going to cover that later.
[00:56:46.338 --> 00:56:47.919]  Where is it?
[00:56:47.919 --> 00:56:50.901]  They laugh about it like it's funny.
[00:56:50.901 --> 00:56:53.743]  Well, I know it's up on Prison Planet.
[00:56:53.743 --> 00:56:57.826]  I know it's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:56:57.826 --> 00:57:00.448]  And then I've got all these people living in denial
[00:57:02.202 --> 00:57:12.164]  About Barack Obama's website, Change.gov, that they... that they sponged, that they covered up.
[00:57:12.164 --> 00:57:14.805]  But they erased a bunch of it, Saturday.
[00:57:14.805 --> 00:57:16.986]  We reported last week.
[00:57:16.986 --> 00:57:19.026]  I just went there and read it with horror.
[00:57:19.026 --> 00:57:21.407]  America Serves was the link.
[00:57:21.407 --> 00:57:26.728]  And it says mandatory service basically for everybody, up until they're 70.
[00:57:26.728 --> 00:57:30.349]  National draft, you've got to join the military and serve.
[00:57:33.497 --> 00:57:41.560]  And then now we have Rahm Emanuel telling the New York Daily News this in an interview, and people are still in denial.
[00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:50.224]  I mean, I don't know what I'm supposed to do here with this level of denial.
[00:57:50.224 --> 00:57:53.625]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:57:53.625 --> 00:57:55.666]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:04.685 --> 00:58:05.786]  It was an inside job!
[00:58:05.786 --> 00:58:07.366]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:58:07.366 --> 00:58:09.067]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:58:09.067 --> 00:58:11.949]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:58:11.949 --> 00:58:17.011]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:58:17.011 --> 00:58:25.235]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door!
[00:58:25.235 --> 00:58:30.158]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:58:37.982 --> 00:58:41.423]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:58:41.423 --> 00:58:44.303]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:58:44.303 --> 00:58:50.785]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[00:58:55.866 --> 00:59:01.447]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:59:01.447 --> 00:59:03.847]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:03.847 --> 00:59:06.628]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:13.223 --> 00:59:14.544]  Big Brother.
[00:59:14.544 --> 00:59:16.304]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:16.304 --> 00:59:18.065]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:18.065 --> 00:59:19.646]  You want answers?
[00:59:19.646 --> 00:59:20.546]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:20.546 --> 00:59:25.408]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:25.408 --> 00:59:29.470]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:31.411 --> 00:59:34.113]  I found the Rothschild article.
[00:59:34.113 --> 00:59:36.255]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:59:36.255 --> 00:59:44.682]  The headline, Barron, the Rothschild economic crisis will bring new world order, global governance.
[00:59:44.682 --> 00:59:48.305]  That's out of the national newspaper of the United Arab Emirates.
[00:59:48.305 --> 00:59:54.150]  In a sit-down interview with him, he says, Barron Rothschild shares most people's view that there is a new world order.
[00:59:54.150 --> 00:59:58.113]  In his opinion, banks will deleverage and there will be a new form of global governance.
[00:59:59.215 --> 01:00:02.658]  But you have to be careful of caricatures.
[01:00:02.658 --> 01:00:06.781]  We don't want to go from ultra-liberalism to protectionism.
[01:00:06.781 --> 01:00:12.526]  When he goes on to talk about the world government, and how they've got their fingers in all the world banking.
[01:00:12.526 --> 01:00:21.674]  Now, the general public, I remember Limbaugh, 15 years ago, saying Rothschilds didn't exist.
[01:00:21.674 --> 01:00:22.855]  CFR didn't exist.
[01:00:23.539 --> 01:00:25.881]  Now he admits they exist, but says they run nothing.
[01:00:25.881 --> 01:00:32.726]  And then openly, we have hundreds of newspapers with the headline, New World Order, banks to set up world government to control everything.
[01:00:32.726 --> 01:00:34.367]  Nothing on Sean Hannity.
[01:00:34.367 --> 01:00:35.688]  Nothing on Rush Limbaugh.
[01:00:35.688 --> 01:00:40.251]  They will not attack Barack Obama for real issues.
[01:00:40.251 --> 01:00:40.852]  They can't.
[01:00:40.852 --> 01:00:44.435]  In fact, they say, oh, Barack Obama wants to steal the pension funds.
[01:00:44.435 --> 01:00:45.555]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:00:45.555 --> 01:00:47.297]  JBS did a great story yesterday.
[01:00:47.297 --> 01:00:51.640]  Paul Watson did an even bigger one at PrisonPlanet.com saying that
[01:00:52.467 --> 01:00:59.030]  Both parties are actually for it and giving you the quotes from the congressional hearings last week.
[01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:01.631]  And then the public again runs away from a threat.
[01:01:01.631 --> 01:01:03.692]  Psychologically, they say it doesn't exist.
[01:01:03.692 --> 01:01:06.273]  People are emailing us saying we're making it up.
[01:01:06.273 --> 01:01:08.133]  We're against Obama.
[01:01:08.133 --> 01:01:11.255]  No, we're against taking your pension funds and your 401Ks.
[01:01:11.255 --> 01:01:12.595]  Okay?
[01:01:12.595 --> 01:01:18.818]  I mean, they're openly getting ready to start snatching them and taxing them and not letting them be tax exempt and stealing.
[01:01:18.818 --> 01:01:21.939]  The government will take it over and then give you part of it maybe down the road.
[01:01:23.271 --> 01:01:27.292]  And listen, we're not going to stop this if you don't get out of denial.
[01:01:27.292 --> 01:01:29.573]  The denial has to stop, okay?
[01:01:29.573 --> 01:01:30.913]  FEMA camps are real.
[01:01:30.913 --> 01:01:32.253]  Rothschilds are real.
[01:01:32.253 --> 01:01:36.154]  The New World Order is real.
[01:01:36.154 --> 01:01:37.354]  This stuff is real.
[01:01:37.354 --> 01:01:40.675]  I haven't even gotten the Rahm Emanuel.
[01:01:40.675 --> 01:01:43.556]  We have his book, The New Chief of Staff for Obama.
[01:01:43.556 --> 01:01:48.237]  We have him saying that you'll have to serve in the military.
[01:01:48.237 --> 01:01:50.278]  If you read the fine print, it's what Clinton proposed.
[01:01:50.278 --> 01:01:51.558]  It was Rahm Emanuel who proposed it.
[01:01:53.067 --> 01:01:54.728]  It's basically the Israeli model.
[01:01:54.728 --> 01:01:58.692]  You have to serve for three months, and then you're in the Guard.
[01:01:58.692 --> 01:02:05.217]  He says, in the National Guard, and then you'll be called up whenever they want you to be sent to Iraq or domestically or anywhere.
[01:02:05.217 --> 01:02:08.540]  It's just a three-month basic training, just like the National Guard training.
[01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:14.064]  That's what he says on the audio tape to the New York Daily News.
[01:02:14.064 --> 01:02:19.809]  And, um... They say... I'm gonna play it later, after Alan Watt leaves us.
[01:02:21.301 --> 01:02:26.204]  He openly says you're going to have national compulsory service.
[01:02:26.204 --> 01:02:27.144]  But he says, what's wrong with that?
[01:02:27.144 --> 01:02:28.985]  It'll teach you how to be an American.
[01:02:28.985 --> 01:02:32.027]  Now that was all on Barack Obama's website.
[01:02:32.027 --> 01:02:33.187]  Change.gov.
[01:02:33.187 --> 01:02:34.168]  And they took it down.
[01:02:34.168 --> 01:02:46.914]  And we have a video clip of him saying, a civilian force as strong and as large, a million man, for domestic spying.
[01:02:46.914 --> 01:02:48.555]  And Rahm Emanuel's proposed that as well.
[01:02:49.423 --> 01:03:00.553]  I mean, by the way, it's an environmental brigade of three million, a spy brigade of one million, mandatory college students have to serve in it domestically, high school students.
[01:03:00.553 --> 01:03:04.256]  It's Secure Corps, a division of AmeriCorps, set up by Clinton.
[01:03:04.256 --> 01:03:04.996]  Bush continued it.
[01:03:04.996 --> 01:03:06.618]  It was in the Philadelphia Daily News.
[01:03:06.618 --> 01:03:16.026]  We've got to go pull that article up from 2002, where it talked about them training high schoolers with M-16s in warrant service, checkpoints, and fugitive apprehension.
[01:03:18.473 --> 01:03:25.998]  And they're handing out radar guns to the tattletale public, and see things that sound reasonable at first, and then it expands.
[01:03:25.998 --> 01:03:29.800]  FBI has these training events all over the country, and they do it in Europe, too.
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:30.520]  Oh, uh, come!
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:32.621]  You know, their feds do.
[01:03:32.621 --> 01:03:37.204]  Come and, uh, help us track down everybody.
[01:03:37.204 --> 01:03:38.265]  Help us fight terror.
[01:03:38.265 --> 01:03:40.966]  And then you show up to the meeting, it's been in the news.
[01:03:40.966 --> 01:03:43.108]  By the way, does your neighbor have a marijuana plant?
[01:03:43.108 --> 01:03:44.528]  By the way, what's your neighbor saying?
[01:03:44.528 --> 01:03:46.329]  Are they talking about the Constitution?
[01:03:46.329 --> 01:03:47.030]  We have it on video.
[01:03:49.594 --> 01:03:52.797]  See how they... They don't say, we're gonna be secret police tomorrow!
[01:03:52.797 --> 01:03:59.804]  No, they say, it's for the war on drugs, and then it's for terrorism, and then it's for child abuse, and then it's for... Watch your neighbor!
[01:03:59.804 --> 01:04:02.087]  Watch your mommy and daddy doing!
[01:04:02.087 --> 01:04:04.089]  I mean, they're really doing it, folks!
[01:04:04.089 --> 01:04:05.870]  It's already going on everywhere!
[01:04:05.870 --> 01:04:08.013]  They're turning the schools into military academies!
[01:04:09.059 --> 01:04:10.741]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:04:10.741 --> 01:04:15.485]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:04:15.485 --> 01:04:18.448]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:04:18.448 --> 01:04:21.491]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:04:21.491 --> 01:04:27.337]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:04:27.617 --> 01:04:33.402]  Our elected representatives wanted a good ol' boy bailout for the special interest, so they ignored your screams not to do it.
[01:04:33.402 --> 01:04:35.243]  They turned off the telephones and email.
[01:04:35.243 --> 01:04:39.206]  They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air.
[01:04:39.206 --> 01:04:42.028]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[01:04:42.028 --> 01:04:51.175]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities, particularly food, beyond many Americans' reach.
[01:04:51.175 --> 01:04:55.639]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days.
[01:04:55.899 --> 01:04:58.261]  Until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[01:04:58.261 --> 01:05:02.704]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast, there seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[01:05:02.704 --> 01:05:08.388]  The private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[01:05:08.388 --> 01:05:11.650]  The stores have less food, but jack up prices to stay in business.
[01:05:11.650 --> 01:05:14.792]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[01:05:14.992 --> 01:05:16.814]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[01:05:16.814 --> 01:05:20.878]  One-third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[01:05:20.878 --> 01:05:25.042]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food.
[01:05:25.042 --> 01:05:32.549]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the new old order, has a lot less control over you.
[01:05:32.549 --> 01:05:36.493]  And so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[01:05:36.493 --> 01:05:39.356]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:05:39.716 --> 01:05:46.707]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:05:46.707 --> 01:05:49.992]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:05:49.992 --> 01:05:51.494]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:06:01.387]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scried, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[01:06:01.387 --> 01:06:05.151]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:06:05.151 --> 01:06:06.512]  Again, 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:06:06.512 --> 01:06:07.033]  Take action today.
[01:06:07.033 --> 01:06:08.334]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:06:18.010 --> 01:06:24.631]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:06:24.631 --> 01:06:30.093]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:30.093 --> 01:06:32.513]  All right, for the next hour, Alan Watt joins us.
[01:06:32.513 --> 01:06:43.415]  Then we got Gary Franchi popping in in the next hour, as well as Ralph Nader, and then Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America to talk about record gun sales.
[01:06:43.415 --> 01:06:46.776]  The all-time record in the last week since the election.
[01:06:47.583 --> 01:06:50.125]  of Barack H. Obama.
[01:06:50.125 --> 01:06:54.408]  I want to talk about the banker takeover, how they're openly setting up world government.
[01:06:54.408 --> 01:07:01.414]  I want to get into the staged election and how he's using subliminals, NLP.
[01:07:01.414 --> 01:07:04.416]  A lot of people are picking up on it right now.
[01:07:04.416 --> 01:07:09.260]  How they're fooling the public with their man, Barack Obama.
[01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:11.242]  Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.
[01:07:11.242 --> 01:07:15.025]  I want to get more into TV and the subliminals there.
[01:07:15.025 --> 01:07:16.586]  And just how dangerous it is to
[01:07:17.973 --> 01:07:21.554]  Watch television, and to not be aware of what's happening.
[01:07:21.554 --> 01:07:27.556]  He's got the website CuttingThroughTheMatrix.com, and he is also a radio talk show host in his own right.
[01:07:27.556 --> 01:07:29.536]  Alan Watt, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:07:29.536 --> 01:07:31.837]  It's a pleasure to be here, Alex.
[01:07:31.837 --> 01:07:33.077]  What do you want to tackle first?
[01:07:33.077 --> 01:07:34.477]  The economy?
[01:07:34.477 --> 01:07:35.418]  The new Bretton Woods?
[01:07:35.418 --> 01:07:39.018]  I mean, the birth of the world government finally really happening.
[01:07:39.018 --> 01:07:43.780]  They've always had great control, but now total control, or should we get into the staged election first?
[01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:44.720]  What do you want to get into first?
[01:07:46.244 --> 01:07:49.825]  I think really all the elections are staged.
[01:07:49.825 --> 01:07:52.626]  We know that when you go down through your histories.
[01:07:52.626 --> 01:08:01.029]  And you find in every country, every country in the Western world, since before World War II in fact, you go through this farce of election.
[01:08:01.029 --> 01:08:04.530]  But what you do find when you go into history is that there is an agenda.
[01:08:05.279 --> 01:08:15.248]  There is a mandate to bring in a new system, and regardless of the party that seems to get in the agenda rollercoaster forward, it never slows down.
[01:08:15.248 --> 01:08:19.192]  When one party gets in, they never throw out the laws from the previous party.
[01:08:19.192 --> 01:08:20.893]  They stay on the books.
[01:08:20.893 --> 01:08:22.595]  And so it's a continuation.
[01:08:22.595 --> 01:08:26.539]  This is exactly what we find the Founding Fathers talked about.
[01:08:26.539 --> 01:08:28.060]  Jefferson talked about it.
[01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:28.841]  He said, when you see
[01:08:29.759 --> 01:08:30.020]  I think?
[01:08:46.129 --> 01:08:58.273]  Steps and stages all written out long in advance and gone over by think tanks to see all the repercussions, just like a chess game that they've gone through before they even move the first piece.
[01:08:58.273 --> 01:09:05.216]  They know every part of the introduction of the steps and how the public will react.
[01:09:05.216 --> 01:09:08.577]  So we are being trained to react the way they planned us to react.
[01:09:09.443 --> 01:09:13.705]  The new Bretton Woods system, it's time now to bring it in.
[01:09:13.705 --> 01:09:28.071]  We find that John Maynard Keynes, who brought in the Bretton Woods system, a really top eugenicist in his field, and an economist, they're always tying together economics and eugenics.
[01:09:28.071 --> 01:09:30.912]  He said this is only one part of the system.
[01:09:30.912 --> 01:09:38.435]  The next part of the system will be to introduce a world of service, where every individual is responsible to government.
[01:09:39.253 --> 01:09:48.380]  And the government will be in, literally in, your bank account deciding what you earn, what you spend, what you buy, if you can even buy it, etc., etc.
[01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:52.963]  This is the next step they're going into now with the new agreement.
[01:09:52.963 --> 01:10:02.410]  And it ties together with what Karl Marx talked about, which was the three massive trading blocks of the world under a world government.
[01:10:03.087 --> 01:10:03.328]  I think?
[01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:25.375]  Socialism, where you live a planned life from birth to death.
[01:10:25.375 --> 01:10:28.637]  That's what's coming in, step by step by step.
[01:10:28.637 --> 01:10:43.889]  This is a hundred years war, they have said, at the beginning of 9-11, 2001, and by the end of the hundred years war, they hope to have their brave new world in, where literally you'll have a new species of humans.
[01:10:44.549 --> 01:10:48.550]  At the end of the hundred years, who will serve this small, dominant minority?
[01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:51.451]  And by the way, every time we raise that, people make fun of us.
[01:10:51.451 --> 01:11:13.417]  That's BBC, AP, Reuters, headlines, the elites, the anthropologists, the biologists are saying that, that they're going to engineer us with drugs and education and breeding and sterilization to be a, quote, goblin-like, that's a quote on the BBC by the eugenicist, goblin-like creatures
[01:11:14.244 --> 01:11:17.933]  And then there'll be these, you know, ethereal angel-like creatures.
[01:11:17.933 --> 01:11:19.457]  And you talked about social engineering.
[01:11:19.457 --> 01:11:20.480]  Notice they're saying in England.
[01:11:21.539 --> 01:11:23.921]  We're going to ban cheap alcohol.
[01:11:23.921 --> 01:11:27.925]  Well, that means they can ban any type of cheap food, too.
[01:11:27.925 --> 01:11:31.428]  We're not going to address why people are falling apart and being such drunks.
[01:11:31.428 --> 01:11:34.051]  We're going to just try to tax people.
[01:11:34.051 --> 01:11:40.957]  Or, in England, we're not going to let roadside shacks sell things that we say are unhealthy, like hot dogs.
[01:11:40.957 --> 01:11:42.919]  We're going to say what you can serve.
[01:11:42.919 --> 01:11:45.741]  I mean, think about how that sets a precedent for total control.
[01:11:45.741 --> 01:11:47.303]  The same thing now coming in here.
[01:11:48.101 --> 01:11:54.462]  So that's what the national ID cards are all about, is tracking what we do, regulating.
[01:11:54.462 --> 01:11:57.283]  First it starts out with genetic screening.
[01:11:57.283 --> 01:12:02.924]  Now they're saying, well, we're going to make you have genetic screening and then we're going to say whether you can have a child or not.
[01:12:02.924 --> 01:12:06.604]  I mean, they're really pulling the stops out right now.
[01:12:06.604 --> 01:12:07.244]  Yes, they are.
[01:12:07.244 --> 01:12:17.306]  It's total tyranny from every possible angle, even here in Canada, which is no doubt the same across the British Empire, as they still call it, the Commonwealth.
[01:12:18.201 --> 01:12:29.725]  Uh, they're bringing out laws to allow police to come into any home they want on any suspicion that there's any chemical containing, uh, ether, like starting fluid for your car and so on.
[01:12:29.725 --> 01:12:33.466]  In other words, they're giving themselves carte blanche to get into anyone's house under any pretext.
[01:12:34.006 --> 01:12:42.949]  So you are looking at a system where you will have no peace and privacy, and you'll be trained to accept that as a normal.
[01:12:42.949 --> 01:12:47.550]  And so when your neighbors get raided, or you get raided, there's no big deal about it.
[01:12:47.550 --> 01:12:49.130]  It'll become a normal part of living.
[01:12:49.130 --> 01:12:55.432]  And by the way, the British government admits everyone I know, including myself, who's been to England, or who is a citizen there, a subject,
[01:12:56.914 --> 01:12:59.715]  The cops just randomly walk up and ask where you're going, what you're doing.
[01:12:59.715 --> 01:13:01.895]  I'm going to put you in a database now.
[01:13:01.895 --> 01:13:07.497]  And they're rude to you by design to prepare the general public to interface with them.
[01:13:07.497 --> 01:13:08.477]  Yes.
[01:13:08.477 --> 01:13:08.757]  That's right.
[01:13:08.757 --> 01:13:09.438]  It's all training.
[01:13:09.438 --> 01:13:11.298]  Everything really is to train the public.
[01:13:11.298 --> 01:13:21.441]  And we've had 30 years or 40 years of sci-fi movies getting us ready subconsciously for this present system that's coming in now.
[01:13:22.368 --> 01:13:40.188]  And it's no big deal, because we're familiar with the idea of a totalitarian system where the masses live in hovels and rubble, and yet this massive army, well-equipped, that just go in like the Star Wars goons, and this is how we've been programmed to accept this.
[01:13:40.188 --> 01:13:42.311]  There's no outcry from the public because they
[01:13:42.811 --> 01:13:43.852]  It is true.
[01:13:43.852 --> 01:13:56.501]  You see, behavioral psychology and math psychology has been so well studied and introduced and used, and this falls in line with what Bertrand Russell and other big players in their day talked about.
[01:13:56.501 --> 01:14:01.865]  They said that the public will come to conclusions and never know how they arrived at those conclusions.
[01:14:01.865 --> 01:14:03.446]  It'll be by osmosis.
[01:14:03.866 --> 01:14:05.867]  And then they value the propaganda.
[01:14:05.867 --> 01:14:08.349]  They're regurgitating as if it was their own.
[01:14:08.349 --> 01:14:09.569]  They hold on to the lies.
[01:14:09.569 --> 01:14:12.791]  I mean, I have people email me saying, you're making up FEMA camps.
[01:14:12.791 --> 01:14:17.013]  You're making up Barack Obama wanting national service.
[01:14:17.013 --> 01:14:20.315]  You're lying about... I mean, and I'm like, but here's the information.
[01:14:20.315 --> 01:14:22.196]  They just go, we don't care.
[01:14:22.196 --> 01:14:22.876]  You're a liar.
[01:14:22.876 --> 01:14:24.677]  We choose to believe you're a liar.
[01:14:24.677 --> 01:14:28.279]  Can you speak to national service and how that ties in?
[01:14:28.279 --> 01:14:30.941]  National service, in fact,
[01:14:32.248 --> 01:14:42.292]  Obama had it up on his own website, a speech he gave I think in Vermont, that he was going to make a call for basically national service.
[01:14:42.292 --> 01:14:45.133]  He's since removed that from the site, but I have the PDF here.
[01:14:45.965 --> 01:15:03.752]  And so I think in January that's where you're going to hear is this call for you see the want to militarize the whole of society and to do so to get once you have found this in totalitarian regimes like the Soviet system like the Nazi system you must get the youth involved so they will grow up thinking that wearing a uniform
[01:15:04.506 --> 01:15:09.889]  And by the way, Obama's announced it, he's written about it, so has his Chief of Staff, he's given speeches, it was on change.gov
[01:15:30.416 --> 01:15:45.454]  Then he takes it down, says it's all lies, none of it's true, his followers then agree, because they're not ready to launch it yet, then in a few months he'll openly launch it, and then there'll be no discussion about how they lied and said they weren't launching it.
[01:15:45.454 --> 01:15:48.818]  There'll be no discussion at all, and you'll notice too, what's very interesting,
[01:15:49.867 --> 01:15:51.848]  I don't think so.
[01:16:08.935 --> 01:16:14.543]  So here is a president of a country, a national country, talking about global citizenship.
[01:16:14.543 --> 01:16:19.950]  An average person hears this and doesn't really ask, what does he mean by global citizenship?
[01:16:19.950 --> 01:16:24.757]  Well, this is the term used by the Rockefeller Foundation that's right behind Obama.
[01:16:25.581 --> 01:16:33.064]  And Rockefeller himself has been giving out World Citizenship Awards to all the big players for the great work for the last 50 odd years.
[01:16:33.064 --> 01:16:44.129]  And he keeps saying, you've got to sacrifice, you're going to have to give, this is going to hurt, and the revolution is giving everything to the government, being a slave, but then chanting, yes we can, feeling powerful.
[01:16:45.146 --> 01:16:46.828]  That's exactly right.
[01:16:46.828 --> 01:16:48.309]  It's a world of service.
[01:16:48.309 --> 01:16:58.178]  And this goes back through the World Citizenship Society, into the Royal Institute of International Affairs and Council on Foreign Relations, who have drafted up the Amalgamation for the Americas.
[01:16:58.178 --> 01:17:02.702]  They admitted they were the ones behind the drafting up for the amalgamation of Europe.
[01:17:02.702 --> 01:17:09.649]  These are private organizations who take their orders from the Queen of England and the nobility of Europe.
[01:17:10.269 --> 01:17:10.809]  And they say all that!
[01:17:10.809 --> 01:17:11.609]  They do say that, yes.
[01:17:11.609 --> 01:17:14.170]  I mean, that's like Lord Rothschild, Baron Rothschild.
[01:17:14.170 --> 01:17:19.771]  He has both titles, and he's called Baron Rothschild, but his wife on CNN said, he is a LORD.
[01:17:19.771 --> 01:17:20.511]  And, uh,
[01:17:40.206 --> 01:17:46.341]  And, um, again, Wolf Blitzer, who, you know, doesn't tremble before a president started trembling.
[01:17:46.341 --> 01:17:47.844]  Oh, Your Excellency!
[01:17:47.844 --> 01:17:49.608]  Oh my gosh!
[01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:55.342]  Yeah, eugenics is alive and well, and it's actually being introduced now.
[01:17:55.342 --> 01:18:05.025]  We see it from declarations from the BBC, from CBC Canada, and they plan to bring in this brave new world through genetics and social engineering.
[01:18:05.025 --> 01:18:08.386]  Meanwhile, they're poisoning to the water and air in our food.
[01:18:08.386 --> 01:18:15.369]  Let's talk more about that when we get back with the always thought-provoking and extremely accurate Alan Watt.
[01:18:16.849 --> 01:18:22.572]  With Christmas right around the corner and an unstable economy looming, finding the right gift can be tough.
[01:18:22.572 --> 01:18:25.314]  Why not give the gift of an Excalibur dehydrator?

[01:20:16.306 --> 01:20:18.267]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:20:18.267 --> 01:20:21.748]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:20:21.748 --> 01:20:24.009]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.

[01:22:16.852 --> 01:22:32.735]  Alright, a major veterinary university in Vienna, one of the top ones in the world.
[01:22:34.821 --> 01:22:38.382]  We found that feeding mice with genetically engineered maize developed by the U.S.
[01:22:38.382 --> 01:22:47.644]  based Monsanto Corporation with a lower fertility and body weight according to a study conducted by the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna presented Tuesday.
[01:22:47.644 --> 01:23:03.728]  In the study, mice fed with the NK603X Mono 810 sweet corn variety over a period of 20 weeks showed a smaller litter size and lighter offspring than mice fed with non-engineered maize.
[01:23:04.631 --> 01:23:10.593]  And then they go on to the statistical difference being massive and also how many of them were sterile.
[01:23:10.593 --> 01:23:12.974]  I'm going to cover more of this later.
[01:23:12.974 --> 01:23:14.135]  We're being murdered.
[01:23:14.135 --> 01:23:20.217]  I mean, it's a economic genocide, economic annihilation, consolidation.
[01:23:20.217 --> 01:23:21.317]  They are poisoning us.
[01:23:21.317 --> 01:23:22.118]  They are killing us.
[01:23:22.118 --> 01:23:24.238]  This is in all their documents.
[01:23:24.238 --> 01:23:27.580]  And again, the public, we've been right about everything, Alan.
[01:23:27.580 --> 01:23:29.320]  Everything we said is coming true.
[01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:30.521]  We're only reading their own documents.
[01:23:30.521 --> 01:23:33.782]  And still, a lot of people just refuse to listen and laugh.
[01:23:35.084 --> 01:23:36.185]  Yes.
[01:23:36.185 --> 01:23:41.969]  Again, it's a perfect conditioning from birth onwards, mainly through media and so on.
[01:23:41.969 --> 01:23:49.114]  Brzezinski did hit the nail on the head when he said that shortly the public will be unable to reason for themselves.
[01:23:49.114 --> 01:23:54.938]  All their opinions will be given to them, fed to them by the media, through television and electronic media.
[01:23:54.938 --> 01:23:56.539]  And he recently said that again!
[01:23:56.539 --> 01:23:57.380]  The arrogance!
[01:23:57.380 --> 01:23:58.961]  He said, you're dumb!
[01:23:58.961 --> 01:24:00.262]  And laughed at the public!
[01:24:00.262 --> 01:24:01.223]  They enjoy it!
[01:24:01.223 --> 01:24:01.543]  Go ahead.
[01:24:02.202 --> 01:24:04.203]  Well, it's true, and it is perfect conditioning.
[01:24:04.203 --> 01:24:06.024]  It works very well.
[01:24:06.024 --> 01:24:12.827]  And you see, the average person will look to others, especially young people, they'll look to older people for signs of alarm.
[01:24:12.827 --> 01:24:18.310]  And if there's no signs of alarm coming from the adult, the child will think everything is just fine.
[01:24:18.310 --> 01:24:23.513]  And of course, the media will augment that and tell them you're living in the greatest time ever.
[01:24:23.513 --> 01:24:24.714]  Look at all the toys you have.
[01:24:24.714 --> 01:24:25.194]  You have fun.
[01:24:25.954 --> 01:24:29.077]  And there's nothing to worry about, but you're quite right.
[01:24:29.077 --> 01:24:37.784]  I've got a link to a CBC Canada documentary on the infertility in males, and it's astonishing.
[01:24:37.784 --> 01:24:38.604]  They've known this for 50 years.
[01:24:39.853 --> 01:24:41.275]  That's called the vanishing male.
[01:24:57.416 --> 01:24:58.576]  The Vanishing Male.
[01:24:58.576 --> 01:25:05.938]  And that's only one study, but isn't it amazing that everything that's happened has been directed at the male to make him sterile?
[01:25:05.938 --> 01:25:07.098]  Well, they know what they're saying!
[01:25:07.098 --> 01:25:14.780]  Those aren't males because it's the male hormones that also trigger the brain and the different psychological developments we're meant to have.
[01:25:14.780 --> 01:25:17.160]  Instead, we have gelded effeminate men.
[01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:18.780]  I mean, I'm not even attacking these men.
[01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:19.841]  I feel sorry for you.
[01:25:19.841 --> 01:25:21.361]  There's a reason you want to wear lipstick.
[01:25:21.361 --> 01:25:23.981]  There's a reason you desire other men.
[01:25:23.981 --> 01:25:26.622]  You have been hit hard by the New World Order.
[01:25:26.622 --> 01:25:26.782]  Yes.
[01:25:27.282 --> 01:25:32.404]  Back to the League of Nations, which was the birth of the United Nations, really.
[01:25:32.404 --> 01:25:45.608]  The Department of Population Control said at the time they'd have to target the white Western male because he was the most aggressive, he would stand up against their plans, he'd fight their plans, and therefore they'd have to neutralize him.
[01:25:45.608 --> 01:25:46.409]  Well, guess what?
[01:25:46.409 --> 01:25:47.189]  They've actually done it.
[01:25:48.729 --> 01:25:49.130]  They have.
[01:25:49.130 --> 01:25:50.571]  He's a pathetic creature.
[01:25:50.571 --> 01:25:58.519]  He believes manliness is grunting and acting tough and going to a football game and never defending his republic or never being informed.
[01:25:58.519 --> 01:25:59.740]  That's correct.
[01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:00.280]  That's correct.
[01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:02.102]  And the RFM, there's no doubt about it.
[01:26:02.102 --> 01:26:06.386]  And Carol quickly mentioned these physical changes back in the 1960s.
[01:26:08.027 --> 01:26:25.705]  And we know that the hospital reports, too, noticed in females, their hips were becoming suddenly, very suddenly, within a 10-year span, they were becoming narrower, they were having problems with childbirth, because they're also targeted, but Demille more so, he's definitely pretty well sterile now.
[01:26:25.705 --> 01:26:27.086]  He's neutered.
[01:26:27.086 --> 01:26:29.689]  That black-off went well, but now they're going to get into
[01:26:30.356 --> 01:26:31.797]  More intense soft kills.
[01:26:31.797 --> 01:26:38.043]  I mean, they have to slowly ratchet up the cancer and the diabetes, but now it's three, four thousand percent up.
[01:26:38.043 --> 01:26:41.926]  The mass death now, we're getting very comfortable with our deaths.
[01:26:41.926 --> 01:26:50.093]  What we find during World War II, when Canada actually led the world in bacterial warfare and viral warfare,
[01:26:51.088 --> 01:26:56.534]  They also had world meetings during World War II to deal with the post-war society.
[01:26:56.534 --> 01:27:02.040]  And again, they said they'd have to target the males, and they wanted to reduce the population drastically.
[01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:05.523]  They said that the world war would not kill enough young men off.
[01:27:05.523 --> 01:27:08.907]  Now, in fact, the King of England was the one who authorized this study.
[01:27:11.512 --> 01:27:19.746]  Yes, and what they did was they decided to take down the third world countries, mainly Africa, quickly because they were powerless.
[01:27:19.746 --> 01:27:20.848]  No one would stand up for them.
[01:27:20.848 --> 01:27:22.632]  They had no voice and no one really cared.
[01:27:23.337 --> 01:27:28.942]  Yeah, they hard kill the blacks and they soft kill the western whites, and then a lot of racist whites go, yeah, they're killing those blacks.
[01:27:28.942 --> 01:27:31.424]  Hey, pal, they're killing you too, okay?
[01:27:46.232 --> 01:27:47.233]  Alan, we're going to come back.
[01:27:47.233 --> 01:27:48.114]  Just riveting info.
[01:27:48.114 --> 01:27:50.395]  By the way, everything he's telling you is documented.
[01:27:50.395 --> 01:27:51.356]  He has it up on his website.
[01:27:51.356 --> 01:27:54.919]  I have it on my website, my films, and films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global, and Slade.
[01:27:54.919 --> 01:27:58.021]  I'm going to make a whole film just on how they're killing us.
[01:27:58.021 --> 01:28:02.184]  And that goes for you, the cops enforcing this, the bureaucrats, all of us.
[01:28:02.184 --> 01:28:03.525]  I'm sorry to have to give you the reality.
[01:28:03.525 --> 01:28:05.747]  We are being murdered by these people right now.
[01:28:05.747 --> 01:28:07.008]  It's called soft kill.
[01:28:07.008 --> 01:28:08.389]  We're on the march.
[01:28:08.389 --> 01:28:10.931]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:10.931 --> 01:28:13.613]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:29:16.578 --> 01:29:23.366]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:29:23.366 --> 01:29:25.007]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:29:25.968 --> 01:29:27.529]  But who is the enemy?
[01:29:27.529 --> 01:29:28.309]  Bin Laden.
[01:29:28.309 --> 01:29:29.189]  This is his MO.
[01:29:29.189 --> 01:29:30.670]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:29:30.670 --> 01:29:32.670]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:29:32.670 --> 01:29:39.833]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:29:39.833 --> 01:29:40.313]  Some U.S.
[01:29:40.313 --> 01:29:46.655]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:29:46.655 --> 01:29:50.116]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:29:50.376 --> 01:30:00.641]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:30:00.641 --> 01:30:01.861]  Fabled enemies.
[01:30:01.861 --> 01:30:09.405]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:30:09.405 --> 01:30:12.987]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[01:30:17.722 --> 01:30:20.883]  What will happen when the grocery stores are empty?
[01:30:20.883 --> 01:30:23.804]  What are you going to do once your food is gone?
[01:30:23.804 --> 01:30:28.065]  What will you do when the dollar is worthless and your family needs to eat?
[01:30:28.065 --> 01:30:33.466]  Growing your own food is the only way to have real self-sufficiency and peace of mind.
[01:30:33.466 --> 01:30:36.327]  GetSeeds.net is offering an amazing special
[01:30:36.587 --> 01:30:36.987]  We're good to go.

[01:31:03.991 --> 01:31:05.053]  That's 877-394-6657 or go to GetSeeds.net.
[01:31:34.007 --> 01:31:41.850]  Now see, even a song like this can be used for propaganda.
[01:31:41.850 --> 01:31:49.113]  Because in the name of world peace and world unity, they're bringing in world tyranny and world eugenics.
[01:31:49.113 --> 01:31:51.935]  So there's nowhere to run.
[01:31:51.935 --> 01:31:52.695]  Nowhere to hide.
[01:31:53.664 --> 01:31:56.785]  But nowhere is worse in the United States than Western Europe.
[01:31:56.785 --> 01:31:59.006]  Canada, Australia, New Zealand.
[01:31:59.006 --> 01:32:03.789]  It's all the same laws, the same names, the same bureaucracy, web censorship coming in.
[01:32:03.789 --> 01:32:04.829]  It's all happening.
[01:32:04.829 --> 01:32:06.930]  A host of subjects I want to cover with Alan White.
[01:32:07.924 --> 01:32:16.231]  Take a few calls for him, too, before he leaves us at 1-800-259-9231, specifically for our guests, but he can speak to any issue.
[01:32:16.231 --> 01:32:18.513]  Alan, I interrupted you there at the break.
[01:32:18.513 --> 01:32:28.260]  Get into the program of hard-killing the blacks versus soft-killing people in the United States, and now where this agenda is going.
[01:32:28.260 --> 01:32:35.286]  You know, what they realized is that if they could make people ineligible for marriage partners or long-term mating,
[01:32:36.087 --> 01:32:42.029]  By debilitating diseases, then that would help solve part of the problem.
[01:32:42.029 --> 01:32:50.631]  And sure enough, we find out that in the Western world, we have what used to be called aging diseases are hitting the very young now.
[01:32:50.631 --> 01:32:52.011]  You have juvenile arthritis.
[01:32:52.011 --> 01:32:52.912]  It's quite common.
[01:32:52.912 --> 01:32:53.972]  It's from inoculations.
[01:32:54.924 --> 01:32:56.826]  And there's now even juvenile...
[01:33:14.792 --> 01:33:17.313]  Brainwashing diseases like Alzheimer's.
[01:33:17.313 --> 01:33:18.013]  Yes.
[01:33:18.013 --> 01:33:22.694]  We've noticed this and autism has gone from 1 in 25,000 to 1 in 150.
[01:33:22.694 --> 01:33:25.835]  And it's now normal to have 1 in 150.
[01:33:25.835 --> 01:33:28.035]  This is through inoculations.
[01:33:28.035 --> 01:33:33.056]  It's designed targeting of specific age groups and genders and so on.
[01:33:33.056 --> 01:33:40.258]  And anybody that doubts they're criminals, they lie all over the world and say it's the law to take the shots, when it's not the law to take the shots.
[01:33:40.258 --> 01:33:43.719]  So again, that's an illustration just of how bankrupt this government is.
[01:33:44.701 --> 01:33:44.942]  It is.
[01:33:44.942 --> 01:33:47.248]  We are run, as I say, by stealth.
[01:33:47.248 --> 01:33:48.471]  And it's all covert.
[01:33:49.184 --> 01:33:50.405]  We're never told the truth.
[01:33:50.405 --> 01:33:52.186]  You cannot tell the children the truth.
[01:33:52.186 --> 01:33:56.689]  And the truth is, the children would be very upset if mummy and daddy were killing them.
[01:33:56.689 --> 01:34:02.093]  And so mummy and daddy must pretend that everything out there is for your own benefit and is there to help you.
[01:34:02.093 --> 01:34:04.535]  That's how you deal with animals when you put them to sleep.
[01:34:04.535 --> 01:34:05.876]  You don't scare the animal.
[01:34:05.876 --> 01:34:10.399]  You take him in nice and quiet and you inject him quietly and he dies quietly.
[01:34:10.399 --> 01:34:16.263]  We are the children and these big bad wolves at the top are deadly serious and they have been doing it.
[01:34:16.263 --> 01:34:18.645]  And that's the impasse that most people have
[01:34:19.286 --> 01:34:24.650]  That's what Joseph Goebbels' wife, when she brought the, she said, it's medicine.
[01:34:24.650 --> 01:34:26.271]  The older one knew she was being murdered.
[01:34:26.271 --> 01:34:27.572]  She said, no, mommy.
[01:34:27.572 --> 01:34:28.993]  She said, it's your medicine.
[01:34:28.993 --> 01:34:30.594]  I love you.
[01:34:30.594 --> 01:34:31.875]  I'm the government.
[01:34:31.875 --> 01:34:33.116]  Please continue.
[01:34:33.116 --> 01:34:33.496]  Yes.
[01:34:33.496 --> 01:34:34.978]  And that is the trick of it.
[01:34:34.978 --> 01:34:37.459]  You can't tell the children you're killing them.
[01:34:37.459 --> 01:34:42.083]  You're taught the government is the big paternal factor in all of this.
[01:34:42.083 --> 01:34:43.744]  It's there for your own good.
[01:34:43.744 --> 01:34:47.627]  And to train the people to obey government without question.
[01:34:48.291 --> 01:34:55.597]  You know, every inoculation is given by faith from the people who come in to get the inoculation by the doctor or the nurse who gives it.
[01:34:55.597 --> 01:34:58.800]  They have no ability to analyze it for themselves.
[01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:06.406]  What it says on that file is what they believe, and yet I have never met anyone who's had a tour of a vaccine factory.
[01:35:06.406 --> 01:35:10.769]  In fact, one of the biggest vaccine factories in Canada is Baxter Laboratories.
[01:35:10.769 --> 01:35:13.932]  Baxter Laboratories used to be part of IG Farben.
[01:35:14.432 --> 01:35:15.493]  We know what they were up to.
[01:35:15.493 --> 01:35:18.134]  They created the war machine for the Nazi regime.
[01:35:18.134 --> 01:35:24.416]  Well, that's like Bayer knowingly shipping out to over a million people HIV and hepatitis filled shots and the documents came out.
[01:35:24.416 --> 01:35:26.177]  They did it on purpose!
[01:35:26.177 --> 01:35:27.137]  They did it on purpose.
[01:35:27.137 --> 01:35:31.979]  We had a little blurb on a CBC documentary, Canada, which is the BBC of Canada.
[01:35:32.839 --> 01:35:48.812]  And they admitted at the World Health Organization that they'd sterilized millions of women in Africa and India with a fake tetanus shot that was bio-engineered, warfare-planned, engineered to attach itself to a hormone, go straight to the ovaries, and cause massive inflammation and sclerosis.
[01:35:48.812 --> 01:35:54.337]  But see, that's too scary for the public to admit, so they won't check it out and find out it's true, they'll just keep...
[01:35:55.109 --> 01:35:57.571]  Keep taking their injections!
[01:35:57.571 --> 01:35:59.031]  Yes, they will.
[01:35:59.031 --> 01:36:02.754]  We are at a stage now where those who are gone are literally, truly gone.
[01:36:02.754 --> 01:36:07.376]  And we have to accept there's going to be massive losses in this war.
[01:36:07.376 --> 01:36:10.198]  It's a war that's quiet, it's silent.
[01:36:10.198 --> 01:36:17.523]  But there's massive losses and we cannot allow ourselves to be overwhelmed by how massive it all is.
[01:36:17.523 --> 01:36:22.446]  That's what Colonel Alexander calls it, silent weapons for quiet wars.
[01:36:22.446 --> 01:36:22.886]  That's right.
[01:36:23.843 --> 01:36:24.203]  That's right.
[01:36:35.826 --> 01:36:36.547]  We're good to go.
[01:36:56.025 --> 01:36:56.165]  Well,
[01:37:25.060 --> 01:37:36.187]  When I speak to crowds of people that don't know who I am or who are hostile, I just say to them, you know about black men in Tuskegee and letting them die of syphilis over 45 years and spreading it to tens of thousands?
[01:37:36.187 --> 01:37:37.128]  Yeah.
[01:37:37.128 --> 01:37:38.348]  And they say, yeah, we know about that.
[01:37:38.348 --> 01:37:40.149]  Uh, do you know about the atomic soldiers?
[01:37:40.149 --> 01:37:46.253]  How they had to march into the, uh, bomb blast, you know, crater minutes after, uh, knowing it was going to kill them.
[01:37:46.253 --> 01:37:48.074]  They wanted to, yeah, we know about that.
[01:37:48.074 --> 01:37:49.255]  Uh, okay.
[01:37:49.255 --> 01:37:53.257]  Do you now know that they knew Agent Orange was going to sterilize and kill people?
[01:37:53.257 --> 01:37:53.998]  Yeah, we know about that.
[01:37:54.756 --> 01:37:58.078]  Okay, well, you do know about how they irradiated some foster children.
[01:37:58.078 --> 01:37:59.839]  No, we didn't know that.
[01:37:59.839 --> 01:38:00.639]  Well, did you know?
[01:38:00.639 --> 01:38:12.966]  And then you can go down into the horrors, and that was all the black-op government creating and testing the cadres of Army officers, Army and Navy and Marine Corps and private corporate doctors that believe this.
[01:38:12.966 --> 01:38:15.087]  And we'll go along with it, and I've studied Henry Paulson,
[01:38:15.845 --> 01:38:19.890]  Treasury Secretary, the new Fed Chairman, all of them are part of Nature Conservancy.
[01:38:19.890 --> 01:38:22.273]  They all give anti-human speeches.
[01:38:22.273 --> 01:38:24.215]  They all talk about population reduction.
[01:38:24.215 --> 01:38:28.380]  Bill Gates, his father, the head of Planned Parenthood, giving money to eugenics.
[01:38:28.380 --> 01:38:32.785]  I mean, when you look at these people, I mean, that's their ideology.
[01:38:32.785 --> 01:38:35.348]  They believe they're saving the Earth by doing this.
[01:38:36.716 --> 01:38:42.517]  And, but meanwhile, they're really cross-species genetic engineering and doing things that are destroying the environment.
[01:38:42.517 --> 01:38:45.458]  Can you explain from your deep study, Alan Watt, which I really respect.
[01:38:45.458 --> 01:38:47.318]  I mean, I really believe you can teach me something here.
[01:38:47.318 --> 01:38:51.599]  Hold on one second, I'm going to ask the question.
[01:38:51.599 --> 01:39:03.301]  Alan Watt, can you explain to me how they say they're killing the majority of us and soft killing us and how beautiful and wonderful their work is and how disgusting and evil we are and how we deserve to die.
[01:39:04.700 --> 01:39:22.115]  How they claim they're doing this all for the environment, meanwhile they say they're playing God, and that no mutation is a bad mutation, that it's all natural because they're doing this to revolution, they're an expression of evolution, and they constantly talk about destroying the planet, killing everyone.
[01:39:22.735 --> 01:39:28.977]  I mean, when you finally get to the higher levels, they admit that they are playing God and that they want to destroy creation.
[01:39:28.977 --> 01:39:37.420]  So, you've got their serpents that believe they're killing everybody with a soft kill to save the earth, but then at the top, they actually... What makes them tick?
[01:39:37.420 --> 01:39:38.521]  Go ahead.
[01:39:38.521 --> 01:39:40.521]  It is their religion.
[01:39:40.521 --> 01:39:41.062]  There's no doubt.
[01:39:41.062 --> 01:39:41.762]  They do believe.
[01:39:42.589 --> 01:39:59.056]  That a long time ago there was an evolution in the species and that they have proven that they're part of the most advanced creatures who've ever been born and lived by the very fact of their own personal family histories.
[01:39:59.056 --> 01:40:04.359]  The fact that they have amassed incredible wealth down through centuries and held on to it.
[01:40:04.359 --> 01:40:09.001]  That's the key is the ability for your offspring to take over that wealth and hold on to it.
[01:40:09.835 --> 01:40:17.599]  So they prove it, and plus they have selective breeding, where they have their mates matched up for them from other powerful families.
[01:40:17.599 --> 01:40:28.245]  This is how they rationalize it amongst themselves, that they are the proof, the living proof, that they are part of the last great leap forward, and they have the right to rule the lesser types.
[01:40:28.245 --> 01:40:37.891]  When you look into the religion of very high Freemasonry, not the lower level stuff, but the high Freemasonry, which again is full of eugenic theory,
[01:40:38.972 --> 01:40:56.141]  You find that the elite talk about this, they believe that when you come through a new age, and these ages are 25,500 years or so long, a great age, a platonic year they call it, because Plato talked about it too, he belonged to the ancient secret societies.
[01:40:57.160 --> 01:41:04.722]  And they believe, just like the Hindus do, and it really is from the Hindu religion, that all the lesser types must be killed off.
[01:41:04.722 --> 01:41:11.024]  Now, that's also part of the Darwinian theory, which is nothing but Hinduism dressed up.
[01:41:11.024 --> 01:41:16.546]  If you allow the lesser types to come through into the New Age, they will bring down those advanced types.
[01:41:16.546 --> 01:41:19.086]  So they must be killed off to the last man.
[01:41:19.086 --> 01:41:22.147]  That's a true belief within a very firm belief.
[01:41:22.147 --> 01:41:24.228]  Now, meanwhile, they have set up
[01:41:25.706 --> 01:41:28.088]  Cryogenic systems across the planet.
[01:41:28.088 --> 01:41:37.013]  The World Wildlife Fund has three arcs across the world where they have all kinds of cells of all living materials and animals and insects and cryogenic... That's it!
[01:41:37.013 --> 01:41:44.757]  They're going to destroy the planet to bring in the tyranny and then they will rebuild it and through that crisis use that as the cover to exterminate us.
[01:41:44.757 --> 01:41:47.899]  And you're absolutely right, Alan, and I want you to continue here in a moment.
[01:41:47.899 --> 01:41:53.682]  The first Barons of Banking, the big newspaper out of the United Arab Emirates, it talks about the World Bank's meeting there last week
[01:41:54.403 --> 01:42:05.083]  To set up the new international order and he talks about global governance a new world orders taking over now But then the rest of his interview is about how families maintain wealth and how that is their supreme
[01:42:06.225 --> 01:42:11.790]  Victory is that they carried on the wealth genetically and that they didn't let their children become decadent.
[01:42:11.790 --> 01:42:18.556]  And so he's saying he's most proud of the dynasty holding the wealth and expanding the power, not losing it.
[01:42:18.556 --> 01:42:23.120]  So people always ask how you have old elites, or they say, I can't even balance my checkbook.
[01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:24.261]  How do they organize this?
[01:42:24.261 --> 01:42:26.022]  Well, that's why they're in control.
[01:42:26.022 --> 01:42:28.445]  And they believe because they, like they say in
[01:42:29.873 --> 01:42:33.934]  Yes, on public broadcasting, they did a documentary
[01:42:56.232 --> 01:43:02.017]  A couple of years ago on the World Wildlife Fund, and one of their arcs is in Louisiana.
[01:43:02.017 --> 01:43:08.542]  It's headed by a professor, a woman professor, from the local university there in New Orleans.
[01:43:08.542 --> 01:43:14.947]  And she, it's a massive facility, incredible multi-million dollar facility.
[01:43:14.947 --> 01:43:17.610]  She said there are three of them worldwide.
[01:43:17.610 --> 01:43:23.555]  And they have already put together in vitro fertilization some of these
[01:43:24.455 --> 01:43:33.278]  Sperms and ovums from the cryogenics and they can put them into any animal and bring the creature up to term regardless of what kind of creature it is.
[01:43:33.278 --> 01:43:43.901]  In other words, they could bring, they could grow a dog in the womb of a cat or even a lion who started off in a domesticated cat and then transport it from there to a bigger animal.
[01:43:43.901 --> 01:43:47.262]  That's how far ahead they've done and they've been very, very successful.
[01:43:47.262 --> 01:43:51.543]  So they could literally, in the case of disaster, which they can create themselves,
[01:43:52.282 --> 01:43:53.803]  Do the Genesis Project.
[01:43:53.803 --> 01:43:59.848]  The Genesis Project was first mentioned, of course, in predictive programming in the Star Trek movies.
[01:43:59.848 --> 01:44:02.931]  So, they can reseed the planet and recreate it.
[01:44:02.931 --> 01:44:08.115]  Now, this is what they called, by Albert Pike's doctrine, the Luciferian doctrine.
[01:44:08.115 --> 01:44:15.941]  The whole idea, remember, of a Luciferian doctrine was that Lucifer wanted to remake everything in the way that he thought it should be made on Earth.
[01:44:16.878 --> 01:44:23.864]  And in Freemasonry, they actually say that they're here to perfect that which was left imperfect by the Creator itself.
[01:44:23.864 --> 01:44:29.468]  So, by destroying all that was, they will bring in the new, and they will perfect it in their own image.
[01:44:29.468 --> 01:44:34.332]  This is the true Luciferian doctrine that they talk about in their own writings.
[01:44:34.332 --> 01:44:42.499]  And they make fun of us in movies with Terry Gilliam, like Time Bandits, where the devil, he wants, that's what he really wants, he wants to remake it the way he wants it.
[01:44:42.499 --> 01:44:44.240]  Yes, exactly, and they are doing it.
[01:44:45.074 --> 01:44:45.895]  They are doing it.
[01:44:45.895 --> 01:44:47.056]  It's not going to happen.
[01:44:47.056 --> 01:44:48.238]  They are doing it.
[01:44:48.238 --> 01:45:04.976]  And of course, all over Europe they've been up at the North Pole and in Iceland they've built giant vaults, big government vaults, and they're openly getting us ready with films that they put out there about the public being mass sterilized, you know, no one being able to have children.
[01:45:04.976 --> 01:45:06.157]  Again, they're incrementally
[01:45:07.944 --> 01:45:09.066]  Getting us ready for this.
[01:45:09.066 --> 01:45:17.661]  They're incrementally preparing us with all this predictive programming and all these movies like Children of Men that are coming out to do this.
[01:45:17.661 --> 01:45:19.263]  There is no doubt about that.
[01:45:19.263 --> 01:45:21.728]  These science fiction movies and the novels too
[01:45:22.551 --> 01:45:23.651]  Well, here's a very simple one.
[01:45:23.651 --> 01:45:24.311]  It's admitted that G.I.
[01:45:24.311 --> 01:45:25.092]  Joe cartoon in the eighties
[01:45:52.180 --> 01:45:52.781]  That is correct.
[01:45:52.781 --> 01:45:58.845]  Young men, again, especially, and this is well understood too, and the FBI have done studies on this,
[01:46:19.477 --> 01:46:31.021]  Young men who have no male role figure, and most of them today have no male role figure, single mothers who are even ordering the sperm from different countries, they don't want men.
[01:46:31.021 --> 01:46:33.282]  Men are just sperm banks, according to some of them.
[01:46:34.228 --> 01:46:39.033]  And the men grow up, they have no role model, but they still crave the masculine role model.
[01:46:39.033 --> 01:46:49.262]  They either go for the gang leader and become part of the family, and the gang leader... And one thing about gangs, they will stand up for their members, you see, and that's what young men like.
[01:46:49.262 --> 01:46:51.264]  Right or wrong, they'll stand up for you.
[01:46:51.264 --> 01:46:55.047]  And the next step, of course, is the military, which is the biggest gang of all.
[01:46:55.047 --> 01:46:56.669]  It uses all the gang techniques.
[01:46:57.262 --> 01:47:09.749]  And you're brought in there, you belong for the first time in your life, you can wear the black gear, you have a sense of power, where before you were nobody, and you're given the armaments, and you can go and kick butt, as they like to say.
[01:47:09.749 --> 01:47:26.339]  So this is an engineered system, and unfortunately the reason a generation of young men who have had no fathers, most of them, they crave power, now they're accepted for the first time in their lives, and they will do whatever they are told to do to be part of the team.
[01:47:29.426 --> 01:47:36.369]  Absolutely, and then all these shows making the SWAT teams glorified, and it's so fun as they blow everybody up.
[01:47:36.369 --> 01:47:42.252]  And then for someone who's actually conscious, you watch that and it's so empty, and so fake, and so pathetic.
[01:47:42.252 --> 01:47:44.673]  But for most adults, they really buy into it.
[01:47:44.673 --> 01:47:47.715]  They really believe the delusion.
[01:47:47.715 --> 01:47:52.237]  And that's why the social engineers say they're not even really alive, and they laugh at the zombies.
[01:47:52.973 --> 01:47:53.293]  They do.
[01:47:53.293 --> 01:47:57.755]  The zombies are replaceable, as we know, and that's why I tell people, don't start fighting.
[01:47:57.755 --> 01:48:01.817]  The greatest thing they've done down through history is to get the poor fighting each other.
[01:48:01.817 --> 01:48:11.361]  And it's like Tammany said in New York in the 1800s, the mayor of New York, he said, he said, you can always hire half of the poor to kill and fight the other half.
[01:48:12.756 --> 01:48:14.597]  We mustn't attack the ones at the bottom.
[01:48:14.597 --> 01:48:19.839]  They're goons and they're easily replaceable from the hordes behind them that are up and coming.
[01:48:19.839 --> 01:48:22.480]  So we have to go for the ones at the top.
[01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:25.282]  And as I say, these are mass serial murderers.
[01:48:25.282 --> 01:48:28.423]  We have to, and this is the big part, no one wants to go near.
[01:48:28.423 --> 01:48:32.405]  We have to make them accountable and they must pay for their crimes.
[01:48:32.405 --> 01:48:37.627]  But they love setting the precedent to not pay as they openly admit
[01:48:38.544 --> 01:49:02.641]  That no transparency, no Congress, Fed Chairman, former Fed Chairman come out and say, we are above the law, we are keeping the money, and the heads of the banks say, we're keeping it for bonuses, and they laugh at the public, but then, that's not enough to just throw it in our face, they then must lie, and let us know they're lying, and have Paulson come out and say, there's total transparency, and taxpayers are in full control.
[01:49:04.486 --> 01:49:05.107]  So stay there.
[01:49:05.107 --> 01:49:07.830]  I want to get your take on why they do that psychologically.
[01:49:07.830 --> 01:49:12.636]  They will throw at your face, but then to make it even worse, they then say, but I didn't just say that.
[01:49:16.841 --> 01:49:18.041]  I am so frustrated.
[01:49:18.041 --> 01:49:20.482]  I can't seem to remember anything anymore.
[01:49:20.482 --> 01:49:21.062]  What?
[01:49:21.062 --> 01:49:23.822]  Seriously, my memory and attention span is terrible.
[01:49:23.822 --> 01:49:25.242]  I read something and forget.
[01:49:25.242 --> 01:49:26.503]  I forget people's names.
[01:49:26.503 --> 01:49:30.283]  I hear all this great information on the radio and I want to tell people, but I forget.
[01:49:30.283 --> 01:49:32.024]  I... Okay, slow down.
[01:49:32.024 --> 01:49:34.604]  Poor attention and memory loss is not your fault.
[01:49:34.604 --> 01:49:41.745]  Factors like fluoride in the water, aluminum in deodorants, genetically modified foods, the way the education system taught you.
[01:49:41.745 --> 01:49:43.366]  It's all meant to dumb you down.
[01:49:43.366 --> 01:49:45.106]  You know, I can remember everything now.
[01:49:45.106 --> 01:49:46.026]  Even entire books.
[01:49:46.266 --> 01:49:46.566]  What?
[01:49:46.566 --> 01:49:47.127]  How?
[01:49:47.127 --> 01:49:50.369]  There is this website called School of Phenomenal Memory.
[01:49:50.369 --> 01:49:54.153]  Their online course is a real breakthrough in the field of memory improvement.
[01:49:54.153 --> 01:50:03.800]  In fact, they guarantee that every single person will be able to memorize any type of information, including entire books, after they complete just 60 lessons.
[01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:09.165]  And they offer a no-questions-asked, no-time-limit, money-back guarantee.
[01:50:09.165 --> 01:50:09.685]  Wow.
[01:50:09.685 --> 01:50:10.466]  What's the website?
[01:50:10.706 --> 01:50:14.168]  Now don't forget, it's pmemory.net.
[01:50:14.168 --> 01:50:17.110]  The letter P, memory dot net.
[01:50:17.110 --> 01:50:22.833]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[01:50:22.833 --> 01:50:24.174]  And we knew what to do.
[01:50:24.174 --> 01:50:26.155]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:50:26.155 --> 01:50:33.199]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:50:33.199 --> 01:50:38.362]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement.
[01:50:39.338 --> 01:50:42.099]  That the air was safe to breathe.
[01:50:42.099 --> 01:50:49.182]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:50:49.182 --> 01:50:52.363]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:50:52.363 --> 01:50:58.126]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:50:58.126 --> 01:51:00.707]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:51:01.207 --> 01:51:07.113]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.

[01:51:10.176 --> 01:51:15.081]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[01:51:16.414 --> 01:51:25.677]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[01:51:25.677 --> 01:51:33.839]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[01:51:33.839 --> 01:51:36.780]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of
[01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:38.501]  We're good to go!

[01:52:24.796 --> 01:52:27.520]  There's a war on for your mind.
[01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:31.084]  There's a war on for your wallet.
[01:52:31.084 --> 01:52:34.529]  And you're physically being bombarded by the military industrial system.
[01:52:35.453 --> 01:52:37.735]  Then when you get sick, they suck all the money out of you.
[01:52:37.735 --> 01:52:47.901]  The compartmentalized doctors and nurses don't even know what's going on, don't even read their own peer-reviewed journals that admit all of this is happening.
[01:52:47.901 --> 01:52:52.264]  They're passing all sorts of laws to arrest you if you're hurt using a cuss word.
[01:52:52.264 --> 01:52:58.749]  You know, to get more and more people in the system, that's an article up on InfoWars.com, the profanity police.
[01:52:59.489 --> 01:53:02.731]  They see you not wearing a seatbelt, you go to jail.
[01:53:02.731 --> 01:53:06.033]  It's all about getting you in the system for smaller and smaller reasons.
[01:53:06.033 --> 01:53:09.135]  Your child says a cuss word on the playground, they're arrested.
[01:53:09.135 --> 01:53:12.857]  Don't finish your homework, the parents are arrested.
[01:53:12.857 --> 01:53:16.719]  It's all part of lawlessness by the system, getting everybody else in there.
[01:53:16.719 --> 01:53:18.760]  Alan Watt talking about them flaunting it.
[01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:25.884]  Why are the private bankers... Paulson comes out yesterday and says, yeah, we're giving money to secret groups, we're not going to tell you.
[01:53:26.704 --> 01:53:28.925]  Then they say, yeah, two trillion's been spent.
[01:53:28.925 --> 01:53:31.146]  We're not going to tell you where it went.
[01:53:31.146 --> 01:53:35.249]  And, uh, by the way, that's total transparency.
[01:53:35.249 --> 01:53:38.230]  I guess they're just teaching us doublethink?
[01:53:38.230 --> 01:53:44.233]  It is a form of doublethink, but it's also a magical spell, in a sense, a psychological spell.
[01:53:44.233 --> 01:53:50.076]  Because even the average person will sense that there's nothing but massive corruption at the top.
[01:53:50.076 --> 01:53:51.017]  That further
[01:53:52.317 --> 01:53:53.517]  Disarms you in a sense.
[01:53:53.517 --> 01:53:58.121]  It makes you feel even more powerless to realize that there's such corruption above you.
[01:53:58.121 --> 01:54:01.684]  Blatant, flagrant, arrogant corruption.
[01:54:01.684 --> 01:54:07.908]  This is the same sort of system they used, you see, during monarchies, when monarchies ruled with impunity.
[01:54:07.908 --> 01:54:13.272]  And the king's men could just grab you and hang you on the spot for any reason they wished.
[01:54:13.272 --> 01:54:16.735]  So, it truly, psychologically disarms you.
[01:54:16.735 --> 01:54:19.277]  It makes you feel as if you're an amoeba.
[01:54:19.972 --> 01:54:22.013]  Well that's like the State Attorney I had on!
[01:54:42.805 --> 01:54:45.627]  Where they, in Maryland, said it's the law, you've got to take shots.
[01:54:45.627 --> 01:54:50.031]  Had thousands of them outside with riot police and dogs barking at crying children.
[01:54:50.031 --> 01:54:52.192]  And they didn't tell him it wasn't the law.
[01:54:52.192 --> 01:54:56.235]  They lied and he laughed on air and said, I know Alex, I don't give my kids the shots.
[01:54:56.235 --> 01:54:57.797]  And started laughing.
[01:54:57.797 --> 01:54:58.517]  That is correct.
[01:54:58.517 --> 01:55:01.319]  They do not give their children the same shots.
[01:55:01.319 --> 01:55:06.683]  And there are shots, of course, that royalty and so on do get, but it's not available to the public.
[01:55:06.683 --> 01:55:09.646]  What we are fed are simply debilitating diseases.
[01:55:12.083 --> 01:55:16.045]  So, what's going to happen in the near term and in the mid and long term?
[01:55:16.045 --> 01:55:20.588]  I mean, things are really getting turned up right now.
[01:55:20.588 --> 01:55:22.369]  Things are accelerating.
[01:55:22.369 --> 01:55:27.191]  Well, they always wanted this system to be global, standardized.
[01:55:27.191 --> 01:55:28.452]  That's the first key to everything.
[01:55:28.452 --> 01:55:31.634]  Karl Marx came out with the centralization of government.
[01:55:32.541 --> 01:55:42.229]  We find that under the United Nations, we're now under regions, and when you go into the documentation, the reason for the regions, again, is more centralized government over various countries.
[01:55:42.229 --> 01:55:52.798]  Now we're going into global society, and they have to finish off those cultures which have not succumbed and gone under and accepted the Western culture.
[01:55:53.590 --> 01:56:07.253]  So they'll be blown into existence if they cannot produce a generation with indoctrination from UNICEF to be the next leaders of those countries, and then they'll be thoroughly westernized when they do.
[01:56:07.253 --> 01:56:17.734]  But at the end of the hundred years, as I say, they want their brave new world here one way or another, and they'll have Plan A, B, C, and D for every part of it waiting in the wings.
[01:56:17.734 --> 01:56:19.095]  These guys will not give up.
[01:56:21.222 --> 01:56:26.328]  The evidence is in the longevity of their main members.
[01:56:26.328 --> 01:56:36.198]  These characters are still trotting around the globe giving speeches to world bodies on a daily basis in their 80s and 90s.
[01:56:36.198 --> 01:56:38.220]  These guys have a religion.
[01:56:38.220 --> 01:56:41.663]  They are religious fanatics of the ultimate kind.
[01:56:41.663 --> 01:56:44.066]  They truly believe in their quest
[01:56:44.805 --> 01:56:46.788]  And they will keep going.
[01:56:46.788 --> 01:56:49.391]  We can't discuss things with them.
[01:56:49.391 --> 01:56:51.052]  We cannot compromise with these people.
[01:56:51.052 --> 01:56:51.593]  No, no.
[01:56:51.593 --> 01:56:52.855]  They're going to give us no quarters.
[01:56:52.855 --> 01:56:54.076]  Stay there, Alan.
[01:56:54.076 --> 01:56:58.381]  Let's continue talking about how they're murdering us.
[01:56:58.381 --> 01:57:00.283]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:57:00.283 --> 01:57:02.546]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:57:07.057 --> 01:57:13.823]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:57:13.823 --> 01:57:16.465]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:57:16.465 --> 01:57:18.006]  But who is the enemy?
[01:57:18.006 --> 01:57:18.807]  Bin Laden.
[01:57:18.807 --> 01:57:19.667]  This is his MO.
[01:57:19.667 --> 01:57:21.189]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:57:21.189 --> 01:57:22.810]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:57:23.170 --> 01:57:30.320]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:30.801]  Some U.S.
[01:57:30.801 --> 01:57:37.169]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:57:37.169 --> 01:57:40.614]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:57:40.854 --> 01:57:51.116]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:57:51.116 --> 01:57:52.356]  Fabled enemies.
[01:57:52.356 --> 01:58:00.118]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:00.118 --> 01:58:03.459]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:58:09.588 --> 01:58:11.990]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:58:11.990 --> 01:58:21.238]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:21.238 --> 01:58:22.539]  Big Brother.
[01:58:22.539 --> 01:58:24.321]  Mainstream media.
[01:58:24.321 --> 01:58:26.082]  Government cover-ups.
[01:58:26.082 --> 01:58:27.663]  You want answers?
[01:58:27.663 --> 01:58:29.205]  Well, so does he.
[01:58:29.205 --> 01:58:33.388]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:33.388 --> 01:58:37.512]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:42.756 --> 01:58:45.698]  Darkness is upon the world.
[01:58:45.698 --> 01:58:54.563]  A criminal elite adopting eugenics as their scientific excuse to dumb us down poisonous and kill us in masses uncontrolled.
[01:58:54.563 --> 01:58:57.225]  Our guest is going to be with us until about 15 after.
[01:58:57.225 --> 01:59:00.907]  So we're going to come back and take three or four calls in the next segment and let him go.
[01:59:00.907 --> 01:59:05.029]  Then Gary Franci joins us with the In the Fed protest nationwide.
[01:59:05.029 --> 01:59:08.031]  Then Ralph Nader and then of course on the Second Amendment front
[01:59:08.951 --> 01:59:11.352]  On this live Wednesday edition, the 12th day of November 2008.
[01:59:11.352 --> 01:59:14.072]  We're also going to have Larry Pratt on.
[01:59:14.072 --> 01:59:17.233]  Alan Watt from CuttingThroughTheMatrix.com.
[01:59:17.233 --> 01:59:26.816]  Alan, certainly they've conditioned the public to love their slavery, or to feel like they're powerful, or to buy the propaganda as if it was their own.
[01:59:26.816 --> 01:59:28.856]  But what are some of the solutions you see?
[01:59:28.856 --> 01:59:33.257]  I mean, there certainly is a great awakening happening.
[01:59:33.257 --> 01:59:35.358]  What are some of the solutions you see to turn this around?
[01:59:38.115 --> 01:59:42.079]  When it comes to solutions, you must first start with the individual.
[01:59:42.079 --> 01:59:44.342]  This is a war also against the individual.
[01:59:44.342 --> 01:59:45.843]  The United Nations has said so.
[01:59:45.843 --> 01:59:48.366]  They don't like individuality.
[01:59:48.366 --> 01:59:49.948]  They want conformity.
[01:59:49.948 --> 01:59:51.410]  They want the mass man.
[01:59:51.410 --> 01:59:54.794]  But the problem has been organization.
[01:59:55.766 --> 01:59:58.028]  The public themselves are unorganized.
[01:59:58.028 --> 02:00:04.593]  The only organized side is the opponent side, and they have covered every base.
[02:00:04.593 --> 02:00:19.403]  Now, even when you try to start up a grassroots movement, you get infiltrated so quickly by people who start to say the right things and spin you off, or before you know it, you're even on the global agenda towards a better type of global society.
[02:00:19.403 --> 02:00:22.445]  So, we have to be very, very careful.
[02:00:22.445 --> 02:00:23.746]  We need organization and
[02:00:25.408 --> 02:00:31.453]  What really has happened too, you see, the culture at one time was fairly standard throughout the Western Hemisphere.
[02:00:31.453 --> 02:00:33.995]  It was a Christianized culture.
[02:00:33.995 --> 02:00:39.980]  And even if people didn't believe in the doctrine, they still had the culture from Christianity.
[02:00:39.980 --> 02:00:42.502]  And so they could cooperate and help each other and so on.
[02:00:42.502 --> 02:00:46.445]  They were bonded to an extent with each other through the culture itself.
[02:00:46.445 --> 02:00:48.707]  That is why that had to be destroyed.
[02:00:48.707 --> 02:00:51.850]  And now you're left floundering in this space.
[02:00:52.531 --> 02:00:52.891]  We're good.
[02:01:03.948 --> 02:01:10.194]  First and foremost before they can go to help other people and they must overcome the fear.
[02:01:10.194 --> 02:01:15.420]  Fear is the greatest killer and stagnator of all.
[02:01:15.420 --> 02:01:19.023]  You have to overcome the fear because we're getting killed anyway.
[02:01:19.023 --> 02:01:27.572]  When you realize that and you are going to die one day, you have nothing to lose and you must retain
[02:01:28.621 --> 02:01:33.742]  Or even gain empathy for other people around you, even those who don't understand.
[02:01:33.742 --> 02:01:37.784]  It makes you tremendously sad to see them in their ignorance.
[02:01:37.784 --> 02:01:39.684]  They don't know what's happening.
[02:01:39.684 --> 02:01:44.445]  They are parroting, just like automatons, things from the media.
[02:01:44.445 --> 02:01:46.166]  They don't know they're being killed.
[02:01:46.166 --> 02:01:53.728]  You don't have your humanity until you do stand up and fight back, and absolutely, we have no chance out of this if we don't speak out and get involved and resist.
[02:01:54.375 --> 02:02:04.419]  Now, the enemy tried to condition us to go for the banker takeover, but 95 to 98 percent of the polls, thousand to one phone calls to Congress, were against it.
[02:02:04.419 --> 02:02:08.221]  So the good news is, on more and more fronts, people are not buying it.
[02:02:08.221 --> 02:02:19.066]  That's why I was so hurt by the Obama thing, them calling him the one, the savior, the god, because his whole agenda is identical to Bush's, who was another puppet, and it's just sad to see my fellow humans being conned.
[02:02:20.133 --> 02:02:28.281]  Yes, once again, we've got to stop looking for two-legged gods and realize that every single one of us is our own champion.
[02:02:28.281 --> 02:02:38.290]  We are our champions ourselves, and everyone can make a difference when they start to speak up and complain and say, no, no more of this.
[02:02:38.290 --> 02:02:39.190]  We've had enough.
[02:02:39.190 --> 02:02:40.131]  We've had too much.
[02:02:40.131 --> 02:02:41.573]  Thank you very much.
[02:02:41.573 --> 02:02:42.854]  And we've got to start
[02:02:43.855 --> 02:02:51.460]  Literally, setting up organizations to try these people in the future when we do turn all of this around.
[02:02:51.460 --> 02:02:57.564]  We've got to start organizing organizations up and tell them we're coming after you.
[02:02:57.564 --> 02:02:58.185]  Absolutely.
[02:02:58.185 --> 02:03:01.187]  Let's come back and take a few final phone calls for Ellen Watt.
[02:03:01.187 --> 02:03:11.394]  Then we'll look forward to the exciting resistance of the Fed, people actually protesting the real government, the real elite, nationwide with the In the Fed demonstrations, November 22nd.
[02:03:11.394 --> 02:03:12.835]  Stay with us.
[02:03:16.957 --> 02:03:18.638]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:03:18.638 --> 02:03:23.383]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:03:23.383 --> 02:03:26.345]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:03:26.345 --> 02:03:29.408]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:03:29.408 --> 02:03:34.112]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[02:03:34.332 --> 02:03:35.512]  If you simply prepare.
[02:03:35.512 --> 02:03:39.254]  Our elected representatives wanted a good ol' boy bailout for the special interest.
[02:03:39.254 --> 02:03:41.315]  So they ignored your screams not to do it.
[02:03:41.315 --> 02:03:43.155]  They turned off the telephones and email.
[02:03:43.155 --> 02:03:47.117]  They voted to print 850 billion dollars at least out of thin air.
[02:03:47.117 --> 02:03:49.938]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[02:03:49.938 --> 02:03:56.140]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities.
[02:03:56.140 --> 02:03:59.081]  Particularly food, beyond many Americans reach.
[02:03:59.081 --> 02:04:03.543]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days.
[02:04:03.823 --> 02:04:06.164]  Until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[02:04:06.164 --> 02:04:10.607]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast, there seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[02:04:10.607 --> 02:04:16.310]  The private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[02:04:16.310 --> 02:04:19.551]  The stores have less food, but jack up prices to stay in business.
[02:04:19.551 --> 02:04:22.693]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[02:04:22.893 --> 02:04:24.715]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[02:04:24.715 --> 02:04:28.799]  One third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[02:04:28.799 --> 02:04:32.923]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food.
[02:04:32.923 --> 02:04:40.470]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the new old order, has a lot less control over you.
[02:04:40.470 --> 02:04:44.394]  And so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[02:04:44.394 --> 02:04:47.277]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:04:47.617 --> 02:04:54.601]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:04:54.601 --> 02:04:57.883]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[02:04:57.883 --> 02:04:58.803]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:04:58.803 --> 02:05:03.046]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:05:03.046 --> 02:05:09.049]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, freeze-dried, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[02:05:09.289 --> 02:05:15.651]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[02:05:15.651 --> 02:05:20.633]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:05:20.633 --> 02:05:21.773]  Take action today.
[02:05:21.773 --> 02:05:23.614]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:05:23.614 --> 02:05:30.736]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:43.359 --> 02:05:51.287]  Yeah, it's CuttingThroughTheMatrix.com and also Alan Watt sent in Sentinel.eu for Europe and they can download lots of pre-talks I've given.
[02:06:08.701 --> 02:06:23.390]  In the past, covering a lot of this information and the big agencies and foundations and big players behind it, and I give them links to their scripts, actually, and their books and so on, which tell you the whole agenda.
[02:06:23.390 --> 02:06:24.231]  It is out in the open.
[02:06:24.231 --> 02:06:27.513]  HG Wells called it the Open Conspiracy.
[02:06:27.513 --> 02:06:33.517]  And as I say, what I'd like to happen one day in the future, after maybe even millions of us have died off, been killed off,
[02:06:34.122 --> 02:06:34.322]  I think.
[02:06:44.395 --> 02:06:55.998]  One day, hopefully, we can have a new Nuremberg trial and bring them all and all their paid lackeys, all their scientists that have happily worked on these agencies to kill us all, bring them all to justice.
[02:06:55.998 --> 02:07:01.460]  And this would have to be televised worldwide because we could never forget what's been done to the public.
[02:07:01.460 --> 02:07:03.000]  It's a horror show.
[02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.781]  They must stand trial for this one day.
[02:07:05.781 --> 02:07:06.461]  Absolutely.
[02:07:06.461 --> 02:07:08.102]  Let's talk to Mike in Illinois.
[02:07:08.102 --> 02:07:08.862]  You're on the air, Mike.
[02:07:10.828 --> 02:07:13.351]  Alan, how are you guys doing?
[02:07:13.351 --> 02:07:13.471]  Good.
[02:07:13.471 --> 02:07:17.274]  I got a question for Alan, actually two of them.
[02:07:17.274 --> 02:07:23.681]  One of which is, how is Obama going to be falling into this eugenics program?
[02:07:23.681 --> 02:07:25.682]  It seems like everyone they put into office
[02:07:26.383 --> 02:07:34.125]  They have some kind of personal agenda that they're trying to meet for their ultimate goal or ultimate plan.
[02:07:34.125 --> 02:07:37.666]  Well, I've got a comment after Alan, but go ahead, Alan.
[02:07:37.666 --> 02:07:39.407]  Well, I don't think they have a personal agenda.
[02:07:39.407 --> 02:07:40.707]  I think that they do what they're told.
[02:07:40.707 --> 02:07:43.548]  I think Obama actually has been bred for his task.
[02:07:43.548 --> 02:07:45.889]  And yes, you will find that this has happened in the past.
[02:07:46.582 --> 02:07:53.688]  If you go into his mother's history, she was a born and bred revolutionary for the world system.
[02:07:53.688 --> 02:08:00.953]  I thought it funny in his speech, he talks about African-American slaves and so on.
[02:08:00.953 --> 02:08:03.255]  Now the guy was not an African-American slave.
[02:08:03.255 --> 02:08:04.376]  His father was a Kenyan.
[02:08:05.627 --> 02:08:09.292]  He's also related very closely to Bush Cheney, all of them.
[02:08:09.292 --> 02:08:09.392]  Yes.
[02:08:23.070 --> 02:08:24.772]  That's probably not even his father, folks.
[02:08:24.772 --> 02:08:26.093]  Obama has been groomed.
[02:08:26.093 --> 02:08:27.834]  Ron Paul said that here.
[02:08:27.834 --> 02:08:39.124]  But listen, they'll use his individual looks and what he says and does for their angle, their spin, to give the illusion of choice and a variance between the puppet to puppet.
[02:08:39.124 --> 02:08:40.986]  But Obama, because he's black,
[02:08:41.886 --> 02:08:43.267]  It's going to be perfect to lead.
[02:08:43.267 --> 02:08:46.069]  He says he wants to get GMO into Africa.
[02:08:46.069 --> 02:08:48.011]  He says he wants to give women their choice.
[02:08:48.011 --> 02:08:52.974]  That means Planned Parenthood, sterilizing them, injections, abortion.
[02:08:52.974 --> 02:08:56.057]  So yes, he'll make sure that the black babies aren't born.
[02:08:56.057 --> 02:08:57.057]  And he'll be hailed for that.
[02:08:57.057 --> 02:08:58.999]  And Jesse Jackson will cry all day.
[02:08:58.999 --> 02:08:59.800]  That is correct.
[02:08:59.800 --> 02:09:00.780]  You've said it all.
[02:09:00.780 --> 02:09:01.921]  This is how they play the game.
[02:09:01.921 --> 02:09:09.407]  And rather than giving a revolution every four or five years, they give us this choice of voting in a new party who simply continues the agenda.
[02:09:09.907 --> 02:09:11.908]  This is how the trick has been played for years.
[02:09:11.908 --> 02:09:15.530]  Folks, they know that humans build things, we create things, we're amazing.
[02:09:15.530 --> 02:09:26.014]  The globalist system is about diverting you into halls of mirrors, little false realities so you never truly live and see reality for what it is so you can affect reality.
[02:09:26.014 --> 02:09:30.136]  You were meant, you know, we're a species that's like a coral reef, we grow on top of each other.
[02:09:30.716 --> 02:09:34.978]  And they've learned to engineer that and make sure we never leave anything behind.
[02:09:34.978 --> 02:09:37.259]  Only their hand leaves something behind.
[02:09:37.259 --> 02:09:38.599]  I know how short my life is.
[02:09:38.599 --> 02:09:42.141]  I know it's about the mark I leave, what I do for the species.
[02:09:42.141 --> 02:09:44.162]  I live on through the species.
[02:09:44.162 --> 02:09:46.343]  I have a communal love of the species.
[02:09:46.343 --> 02:09:49.444]  Whereas this elite believe they are a super species.
[02:09:50.504 --> 02:09:53.905]  And they have a religious hate of you and your family.
[02:09:53.905 --> 02:09:55.786]  They want to murder you and your family.
[02:09:55.786 --> 02:09:57.767]  They love children dying of cancer.
[02:09:57.767 --> 02:09:58.948]  They love poison.
[02:09:58.948 --> 02:10:00.428]  They love dumbing down.
[02:10:00.428 --> 02:10:02.109]  They love destruction.
[02:10:02.109 --> 02:10:03.570]  It's dominance for them.
[02:10:03.570 --> 02:10:05.250]  It's like sitting on you.
[02:10:05.250 --> 02:10:06.491]  Alan?
[02:10:06.491 --> 02:10:08.091]  Yes, they are psychopathic.
[02:10:08.091 --> 02:10:09.872]  They're so inbred.
[02:10:09.872 --> 02:10:18.716]  And you'll find Obama, I'm sure, if you truly get a hold of his real history, he's just another one who's been treated for the purpose, literally purpose-designed human.
[02:10:19.714 --> 02:10:22.277]  We find the same thing happened with Armand Hammer.
[02:10:22.277 --> 02:10:27.602]  Armand Hammer's father was way up there in communism in the United States.
[02:10:27.602 --> 02:10:31.005]  He was done a few times in charge for backstreet abortions.
[02:10:31.005 --> 02:10:34.708]  He was immediately into the abortion debates way back then.
[02:10:34.708 --> 02:10:39.553]  And then Armand himself was sent off to study with a rabbi at the age of five.
[02:10:39.553 --> 02:10:43.176]  He left home at the age of five to be indoctrinated in his role for life.
[02:10:43.914 --> 02:10:45.015]  Yep, gotta come, Mike.
[02:10:45.015 --> 02:10:45.796]  Kelton in Texas, go ahead.
[02:11:07.906 --> 02:11:08.446]  Are you guys there?
[02:11:08.446 --> 02:11:10.388]  Yeah, we're on the air worldwide right now.
[02:11:10.388 --> 02:11:11.068]  Okay.
[02:11:11.068 --> 02:11:11.729]  Thank you.
[02:11:11.729 --> 02:11:13.950]  I just had a quick comment.
[02:11:13.950 --> 02:11:22.457]  You guys are absolutely right on as far as how the police are implementing tyranny in the community.
[02:11:22.457 --> 02:11:24.578]  I'll give you a prime example.
[02:11:24.578 --> 02:11:27.301]  About a year and a half ago, I was pulled over.
[02:11:27.301 --> 02:11:28.842]  Well, I actually wasn't pulled over.
[02:11:28.842 --> 02:11:36.708]  I was at the bus stop from Austin to Cleveland, and all of a sudden, police officers just pulled me over.
[02:11:37.621 --> 02:11:38.848]  Have me spread my arms.
[02:11:40.701 --> 02:11:48.828]  On the car, and I was telling them, I told them that, hey, you know, my license are in my pocket, uh, my bus ticket is in my pocket.
[02:11:48.828 --> 02:11:50.289]  They were saying, well, where's your luggage?
[02:11:50.289 --> 02:11:56.474]  But my luggage got lost and they put me in the backseat of the car, ran my information and let me go.
[02:11:56.474 --> 02:12:02.719]  Oh, but this is one important thing before, uh, the guy, uh, let me get up off the, uh, the car.
[02:12:02.719 --> 02:12:08.023]  He said, uh, uh, don't, don't make a MFN move or, or you'll become a statistic.
[02:12:09.239 --> 02:12:15.264]  And I found that that is still... That's about humiliating you, letting you know you're lower than dirt.
[02:12:15.264 --> 02:12:18.987]  They're told to do that to train us to accept enslavement.
[02:12:18.987 --> 02:12:23.191]  But don't worry, that cop's gonna have his pension fund taken by his global masters.
[02:12:23.191 --> 02:12:25.873]  He's gonna be hurt by the very same system he loves.
[02:12:25.873 --> 02:12:28.375]  So go ahead and shoot your kid up, cops with vaccines.
[02:12:28.375 --> 02:12:29.556]  Laugh at us.
[02:12:29.556 --> 02:12:30.817]  Go ahead and serve the system.
[02:12:30.817 --> 02:12:32.559]  Go ahead and think your... think your... Alan.
[02:12:33.827 --> 02:12:34.908]  I know, it's disgusting.
[02:12:34.908 --> 02:12:43.873]  You see, the problem again is we have a generation who have been brought up and their heroes have been the goons that they're now dressed up as.
[02:12:43.873 --> 02:12:47.936]  They've become what they wanted to be, the ones with the power.
[02:12:47.936 --> 02:12:50.037]  Look at the movies they watch.
[02:12:50.037 --> 02:12:52.419]  Look at the language in the movies.
[02:12:52.419 --> 02:12:54.840]  Eat this, sucker, etc, etc.
[02:12:54.840 --> 02:13:00.824]  I mean, this is a mentality that was purposely put out there for this generation, the generation they're now using as the bullies.
[02:13:01.562 --> 02:13:07.687]  So, uh, we also have psychopaths in all strata of society, unfortunately.
[02:13:07.687 --> 02:13:14.393]  And they do hire the low-level psychopaths, who would otherwise be smashing windows on streets and stealing stuff from the stores.
[02:13:14.393 --> 02:13:16.415]  And they put uniforms on them.
[02:13:16.415 --> 02:13:22.320]  So, uh, they always use the degenerate class to control the rest of the people.
[02:13:22.320 --> 02:13:23.821]  It's not them anymore!
[02:13:23.821 --> 02:13:25.403]  It's Officer Demomski!
[02:13:26.121 --> 02:13:26.921]  Yep.
[02:13:26.921 --> 02:13:32.404]  Another got me a badge and you're going to learn to respect me.
[02:13:32.404 --> 02:13:34.364]  Alright, appreciate your call, Kelton.
[02:13:34.364 --> 02:13:38.206]  Lisa and Jim, we've just got to leave now because we've got our next guest on.
[02:13:38.206 --> 02:13:47.350]  But next Wednesday, Alan Watt, because he's just such a great man, we appreciate him, has agreed to come on for two hours next Wednesday.
[02:13:47.350 --> 02:13:49.891]  So I'll talk to you in seven days, Alan.
[02:13:49.891 --> 02:13:50.811]  I will do.
[02:13:50.811 --> 02:13:51.171]  You bet.
[02:13:51.171 --> 02:13:51.571]  Take care.
[02:13:51.571 --> 02:13:54.112]  Appreciate you spending time with us.
[02:13:54.112 --> 02:13:55.753]  Alright, we've got Gary Franchi.
[02:13:57.074 --> 02:14:00.855]  The next 30 minutes, maybe longer, until Ralph Nader joins us.
[02:14:00.855 --> 02:14:02.815]  And I always enjoy having Gary Franchi.
[02:14:02.815 --> 02:14:07.856]  Gary Franchi does so much around the community.
[02:14:07.856 --> 02:14:14.857]  And he was involved with the whole freedom to fascism, getting that video out to people.
[02:14:14.857 --> 02:14:17.298]  And he's been a talk show host in his own right.
[02:14:17.298 --> 02:14:25.719]  But he came up with a great idea to have, in the Fed protest, every November 22nd, when they killed JFK, because he tried to abolish the Federal Reserve.
[02:14:26.368 --> 02:14:41.495]  And I think of no better guest to have on than Gary Franchi on the heels of Alan Greenspan on national television, on PBS, saying the Fed is accountable to no one and can do anything and everything they want.
[02:14:41.495 --> 02:14:44.336]  So, Gary Franchi, good to have you here with us.
[02:14:44.336 --> 02:14:45.977]  Alex, it's a pleasure to be here.
[02:14:45.977 --> 02:14:47.038]  Thank you for having me.
[02:14:47.038 --> 02:14:47.638]  Oh, you bet.
[02:14:47.638 --> 02:14:50.079]  Now, tell the listeners specifically
[02:14:51.534 --> 02:15:00.821]  How this idea to physically go protest the Fed developed instead of protesting the fake titular heads, the figureheads, the puppets like Bush and Obama.
[02:15:02.077 --> 02:15:13.785]  Well, I mean, we can sit around and we can complain about the Republicans and the Democrats, but we know that they are just the pawns on the chessboard.
[02:15:13.785 --> 02:15:18.728]  The real power comes from the source of the money, and that's the Federal Reserve System.
[02:15:18.728 --> 02:15:19.829]  You've known this for a long time.
[02:15:19.829 --> 02:15:21.510]  I've known this for a long time.
[02:15:21.510 --> 02:15:27.374]  And it's time that we wake up the American people and say, we are going to go to the source of the problem.
[02:15:28.014 --> 02:15:29.876]  We're going to raise public awareness.
[02:15:29.876 --> 02:15:32.898]  We're going to shout at the top of our lungs.
[02:15:32.898 --> 02:15:34.720]  We're going to say, it is time.
[02:15:34.720 --> 02:15:41.665]  We're making a declaration on the 22nd of November to end the Federal Reserve System.
[02:15:41.665 --> 02:15:47.750]  That is the day that the Federal Reserve was birthed on Jekyll Island.
[02:15:47.750 --> 02:15:49.391]  So that's why we chose the date.
[02:15:49.391 --> 02:15:54.015]  And it's also near the Kennedy assassination date.
[02:15:54.015 --> 02:15:55.756]  And we know that he went up against them as well.
[02:15:56.542 --> 02:15:59.743]  Oh yeah, I mean, you know, Kennedy had, uh, you know, started printing up U.S.
[02:15:59.743 --> 02:16:01.843]  notes, started competing with the Federal Reserve notes.
[02:16:01.843 --> 02:16:03.864]  They, you know, they had to get rid of him, too.
[02:16:03.864 --> 02:16:06.304]  So, it's time.
[02:16:06.304 --> 02:16:07.264]  It is time.
[02:16:07.264 --> 02:16:10.445]  These bankers are running rampant over the American people.
[02:16:10.445 --> 02:16:17.127]  I mean, Paulson today is saying that he's not going to put money towards this, bailout money towards the mortgages.
[02:16:17.127 --> 02:16:18.847]  He's going to put it towards credit cards instead.
[02:16:20.467 --> 02:16:28.772]  And again, that's not paying off the debts of the credit card holders, and then just giving that money to them.
[02:16:28.772 --> 02:16:44.240]  The credit card holder will still have to pay, it's just the credit card company gets double paid, then they're going to take that money as bonuses, and then he said yesterday it's all secret, but then today he said it's all transparent, and they say true trillion is just missing.
[02:16:45.350 --> 02:16:47.591]  Oh yeah, isn't that convenient?
[02:16:47.591 --> 02:16:53.833]  The former head of Goldman Sachs is pumping all this money that you can't even track back to his Wall Street buddies.
[02:16:53.833 --> 02:16:58.954]  This is a disgrace, this is high treason, and the American people will not stand for it anymore.
[02:16:58.954 --> 02:17:03.616]  Never, ever in American history have we had an opportunity like we do today.
[02:17:04.156 --> 02:17:05.396]  Stay there my friend, we'll be right back.
[02:17:24.682 --> 02:17:24.962]  Let's go!
[02:17:42.193 --> 02:17:42.593]  I don't know.
[02:18:04.480 --> 02:18:08.341]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:18:08.341 --> 02:18:09.522]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:18:34.191 --> 02:18:35.752]  But who is the enemy?
[02:18:35.752 --> 02:18:36.552]  Bin Laden.
[02:18:36.552 --> 02:18:37.593]  This is his M.O.
[02:18:37.593 --> 02:18:38.914]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:18:38.914 --> 02:18:40.915]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:18:40.915 --> 02:18:48.059]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:18:48.059 --> 02:18:48.539]  Some U.S.
[02:18:48.539 --> 02:18:54.182]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:18:54.882 --> 02:18:58.403]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:18:58.403 --> 02:19:01.184]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:19:26.067 --> 02:19:28.409]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[02:19:28.409 --> 02:19:34.655]  Are you confident that the financial advisor is experienced enough to combat climbing interest rates, taxes, and inflation?

[02:20:24.688 --> 02:20:28.149]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[02:20:28.149 --> 02:20:32.391]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[02:20:32.391 --> 02:20:44.055]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[02:20:44.055 --> 02:20:49.877]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[02:20:49.957 --> 02:20:50.357]  I think so.
[02:21:10.555 --> 02:21:11.536]  We're good to go.
[02:21:47.934 --> 02:22:04.264]  Alright, Gary Franchi in the Fed.
[02:22:04.264 --> 02:22:07.165]  Tell us about the website, tell us about the different groups around the country.
[02:22:07.165 --> 02:22:12.028]  I'm going to be up there for the JFK 45th anniversary of the Federal Reserve.
[02:22:12.028 --> 02:22:14.950]  Private banking group, same one's raping us right now, killing Kennedy.
[02:22:15.658 --> 02:22:20.168]  And so perfect for me to drop by over there to the demonstration of the Dallas Federal Reserve.
[02:22:20.168 --> 02:22:22.593]  Tell folks what's being planned at these locations across the country.
[02:22:23.511 --> 02:22:24.292]  Well, here's the plan.
[02:22:24.292 --> 02:22:28.334]  And if people want to get further involved, and we want people to, we want people to spread this message.
[02:22:28.334 --> 02:22:30.196]  We need the largest turnout we can.
[02:22:30.196 --> 02:22:38.001]  As far as I know, this is the first time we've ever organized nationally against an economic issue like the Federal Reserve.
[02:22:38.001 --> 02:22:40.723]  So this is a really historic day.
[02:22:40.723 --> 02:22:43.405]  We need to get everybody all hands on deck for this.
[02:22:43.405 --> 02:22:46.407]  You can do that by going to endthefed.us.
[02:22:46.407 --> 02:22:47.287]  Very simple.
[02:22:47.287 --> 02:22:48.068]  Fill out the form there.
[02:22:49.020 --> 02:22:57.105]  Uh, and then you can go to RestoreTheRepublic.net and there are groups there for every single Federal Reserve District.
[02:22:57.105 --> 02:23:03.269]  All you gotta do is just plug in your email and then join the group and then the group organizer will contact you.
[02:23:03.269 --> 02:23:05.850]  Uh, all the details are there on the events calendar.
[02:23:05.850 --> 02:23:12.014]  And, you know, what we want people to do, especially, we create a special issue of Republic Magazine just for this very event.
[02:23:12.694 --> 02:23:14.335]  I think it's also important to point out
[02:23:33.998 --> 02:23:43.810]  There's a bunch of groups doing this so they can basically put out what they want, but that it's the Federal Reserve, it's private, and that they engineered the collapse and the looting and the robbery, the heist.
[02:23:43.810 --> 02:23:47.414]  You know, Ron Paul has said it's that, it's a heist that we're witnessing right now.
[02:23:48.641 --> 02:24:04.386]  Oh, I mean, Alex, a couple months ago, I went to a Federal Reserve conference here in Chicago, and I interviewed the public relations officer for the Fed, and this guy laid it out.
[02:24:04.386 --> 02:24:08.087]  You know, he was basically boasting that the Federal Reserve is a private bank.
[02:24:08.087 --> 02:24:11.568]  I mean, I got it all on camera, and he just laid it out, you know?
[02:24:11.568 --> 02:24:13.949]  Talked about how much money they print every day.
[02:24:13.949 --> 02:24:15.549]  It was a shocking
[02:24:18.886 --> 02:24:27.688]  Yeah, that's the big issue.
[02:24:27.688 --> 02:24:30.289]  In the past, they hid it and lied about it.
[02:24:30.289 --> 02:24:39.951]  Now, Mayor Rothschild, Baron Rothschild, is in the news saying, I run the New World Order, global government, ha ha ha, we're stealing all your money.
[02:24:39.951 --> 02:24:42.692]  I mean, they're just right out in the open now.
[02:24:43.587 --> 02:24:44.567]  Yeah.
[02:24:44.567 --> 02:24:46.488]  Well, that's why we're organizing these things.
[02:24:46.488 --> 02:24:50.589]  You know, we want cooperation and respect for local law enforcement authorities.
[02:24:50.589 --> 02:24:55.630]  You know, we don't want everyone, you know, breaking all the windows of the Federal Reserve Bank.
[02:24:55.630 --> 02:24:56.831]  Yeah, but we know what's going to happen.
[02:24:56.831 --> 02:24:58.271]  They're not going to be respectful.
[02:24:58.271 --> 02:25:01.352]  And if anybody breaks windows, it'll be cops dressed up like us.
[02:25:01.352 --> 02:25:02.612]  They just got caught in Denver.
[02:25:02.612 --> 02:25:04.093]  It's now confirmed.
[02:25:04.093 --> 02:25:06.093]  Yeah, I mean, that's their modus operandi.
[02:25:06.093 --> 02:25:08.414]  You know, they have their Asian provocateurs.
[02:25:08.414 --> 02:25:10.614]  So everybody has to be... By the way, they're public servants, though.
[02:25:10.614 --> 02:25:12.795]  I mean, I don't really call them authorities myself.
[02:25:14.188 --> 02:25:18.570]  Well, we want people to be on the lookout for provocateurs.
[02:25:18.570 --> 02:25:20.391]  We want people to bring cameras.
[02:25:20.391 --> 02:25:26.594]  You know, the camera today, you know this Alex, is the best weapon that we have, you know, to fight this information war.
[02:25:26.594 --> 02:25:32.136]  You know, we don't want to block pedestrian or vehicular traffic.
[02:25:32.136 --> 02:25:40.680]  You know, every city has different ordinances, so... Every city has different ways of suppressing and controlling the slaves as they're bled.
[02:25:40.680 --> 02:25:42.081]  That's a better way of putting it.
[02:25:42.461 --> 02:25:57.940]  But I mean, regardless, we're going to be out there handing out flyers, material, exposing everybody in every city needs to call the media and let them know you're going to be out there protesting the private Federal Reserve, engineering the collapse of the economy, and looting the economy with the bailout.
[02:25:57.940 --> 02:25:59.101]  And this is very popular...
[02:26:00.346 --> 02:26:02.008]  We got some.
[02:26:02.008 --> 02:26:06.233]  You're familiar with our publication, the next issue of Republic Magazine.
[02:26:06.233 --> 02:26:08.516]  The cutoff time tomorrow is 1 o'clock.
[02:26:08.516 --> 02:26:12.520]  If you want them, you gotta get them now at republicmagazines.com.
[02:26:12.520 --> 02:26:19.589]  This is a 48-page, fully-stacked info bomb that will wake up the people and just send the message home.
[02:26:20.349 --> 02:26:27.972]  And we really want people to get out there, pass these out, pass out copies of America's Freedom of Fascism, and wake up the people!
[02:26:27.972 --> 02:26:28.592]  It's time!
[02:26:28.592 --> 02:26:39.616]  The Federal Reserve has to be shut down, and on a nationwide scale, if we all stand in unison and make the Declaration on the 22nd of November, we can see change coming.
[02:26:39.616 --> 02:26:44.538]  Not some fake change, this perceived change that we're going to get next year with Obama.
[02:26:44.538 --> 02:26:45.959]  That's a whole fraud in itself.
[02:26:48.260 --> 02:26:49.261]  We're getting a change.
[02:26:49.261 --> 02:26:52.482]  They're going to put it in higher gear, raping the people.
[02:26:52.482 --> 02:26:53.142]  Gary, stay there.
[02:26:53.142 --> 02:26:55.623]  Let's do a few more minutes on the other side.
[02:26:55.623 --> 02:27:00.625]  In the Fed, ladies and gentlemen, and locations all over the country, we'll tell you about some of the locations.
[02:27:00.625 --> 02:27:02.906]  When we get back, be part of history.
[02:27:02.906 --> 02:27:07.808]  All of this is about exposing the enemy, exposing the culprits, exposing the criminals that are behind all this.
[02:27:15.285 --> 02:27:19.219]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:19.219 --> 02:27:21.928]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:30.363 --> 02:27:33.305]  What will you do when it happens?
[02:27:33.305 --> 02:27:38.328]  When you turn to your loved ones, will you see starvation and fear?
[02:27:38.328 --> 02:27:44.652]  Or confidence because you knew what was coming and got prepared with PatriotFood.com?
[02:27:44.652 --> 02:27:46.533]  The signs are everywhere.
[02:27:46.533 --> 02:27:48.554]  You have no excuses.
[02:27:48.554 --> 02:27:52.817]  Your indifference today will determine the magnitude of your suffering tomorrow.
[02:27:53.517 --> 02:27:58.940]  What good is it to know the truth about any conspiracy unless you take action?
[02:27:58.940 --> 02:28:04.523]  Patriotfood.com has 100 pounds of dry food supplies for just $3 a pound.
[02:28:04.523 --> 02:28:08.545]  At Patriotfood.com, you'll get 20 survival foods.
[02:28:08.545 --> 02:28:15.089]  Varieties like dried tomatoes, wild rice blend, beef base, granola, vegetable mix, and much more.
[02:28:15.089 --> 02:28:17.810]  There are just two kinds of people.
[02:28:17.810 --> 02:28:19.831]  Slave and free.
[02:28:19.831 --> 02:28:20.852]  Be ready.
[02:28:20.852 --> 02:28:21.352]  Be free.
[02:28:21.832 --> 02:28:24.913]  With PatriotFood.com.
[02:28:24.913 --> 02:28:27.114]  May I have everybody's attention please?
[02:28:27.114 --> 02:28:30.515]  I've come with a message of information.
[02:28:30.515 --> 02:28:31.755]  9-11 was an inside job.
[02:28:31.755 --> 02:28:33.315]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[02:28:33.315 --> 02:28:34.956]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[02:28:34.956 --> 02:28:37.917]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[02:28:37.917 --> 02:28:41.558]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the bilateral commission, the CFR?
[02:28:48.404 --> 02:28:54.708]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[02:28:54.708 --> 02:28:56.710]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[02:29:15.094 --> 02:29:16.755]  How much food do you have in your fridge?
[02:29:16.755 --> 02:29:19.057]  How long would it last in the event of a nationwide crisis?
[02:29:19.057 --> 02:29:22.560]  SurvivalGearSource.com is America's number one source for survival kits and supplies.
[02:29:36.491 --> 02:29:36.991]  I think so.
[02:29:55.516 --> 02:30:06.780]  Get prepared for nuclear and bioterrorism with a complete terror protection kit, including gas masks, bio suits, potassium iodate, a solar hand crank flashlight, radio, cell phone charger, and much more!
[02:30:06.780 --> 02:30:07.700]  Prepare now!

[02:30:10.821 --> 02:30:12.642]  That's 877-231-1925.
[02:30:12.642 --> 02:30:17.204]  Or go to survivalgearsource.com.

[02:30:21.525 --> 02:30:22.585]  Survivalgearsource.com.
[02:30:39.295 --> 02:30:45.259]  Ralph Nader is joining us in about 8-9 minutes.
[02:30:45.259 --> 02:30:52.304]  Talk about the bailout, what's happening, what happened to the election, Fox News trying to demonize him, and a lot more.
[02:30:52.304 --> 02:30:57.067]  So that is coming up in a few minutes.
[02:30:57.067 --> 02:31:01.931]  Got Larry Pratt, what's happening with the Second Amendment coming up in the next hour as well.
[02:31:01.931 --> 02:31:07.575]  We will have open phones for the first 30 minutes of the next hour before Larry Pratt joins us.
[02:31:08.784 --> 02:31:18.029]  Uh, the Federal Reserve in Dallas, where I will be on the 22nd, maybe split between there and the grassy knoll.
[02:31:18.029 --> 02:31:22.072]  Same date the Federal Reserve was hatched at Jekyll Island, same date they killed President Kennedy.
[02:31:22.072 --> 02:31:26.154]  The main reason was trying to abolish the Fed, kick out this shadow government.
[02:31:28.552 --> 02:31:34.034]  2,200 North Pearl Street, Dallas, Texas, 75201.
[02:31:34.034 --> 02:31:40.396]  Or you can call the Federal Reserve at 214-922-6000.
[02:31:40.396 --> 02:31:47.918]  But if you go to the inthefed.us, you can find out about... How many Fed locations are you guys going to be at?
[02:31:47.918 --> 02:31:50.539]  Right now I'm looking at the restoretherepublic.net site.
[02:31:50.539 --> 02:31:54.120]  We've got 52 groups actively organizing right now.
[02:31:56.101 --> 02:32:05.764]  Yeah, there's about 38 locations nationwide.
[02:32:05.764 --> 02:32:09.465]  So we want people to go to the major banks.
[02:32:09.465 --> 02:32:17.347]  And if they don't have a major Federal Reserve Bank local, then we want them to find the next best thing, which would be a Federal Reserve Branch office.
[02:32:18.087 --> 02:32:22.729]  And go and protest, or rally, as the terminology we're using.
[02:32:22.729 --> 02:32:26.751]  Go and rally in front of those locations for sound money.
[02:32:26.751 --> 02:32:31.674]  And folks, it doesn't matter if it's only 10 of you, but be sure and go to the site and coordinate with people.
[02:32:31.674 --> 02:32:39.818]  But the key, in my opinion, is to call your local newspapers and TV and say, hey, we're going to be out here protesting.
[02:32:39.818 --> 02:32:40.978]  Leave it simple.
[02:32:40.978 --> 02:32:44.800]  The Fed's policies and the bailout.
[02:32:45.678 --> 02:32:50.200]  And then, you know, once they get out there, they're going to get an earful about the Private Full Reserve and the rest of it.
[02:32:50.200 --> 02:32:51.241]  I mean, I think that's a great idea.
[02:32:51.241 --> 02:32:58.184]  So the key here is to call alternative media, mainstream media, college newspapers.
[02:32:58.184 --> 02:32:58.944]  Get them out there.
[02:32:58.944 --> 02:33:00.125]  And that's the point.
[02:33:00.125 --> 02:33:05.327]  Having rallies at 38 locations, demonstrations saying, we know you're the real government.
[02:33:05.327 --> 02:33:07.288]  We know you're the real cause.
[02:33:07.288 --> 02:33:09.769]  I just salute everybody that's out there.
[02:33:09.769 --> 02:33:11.130]  And Gary, I'm going to put you on hold.
[02:33:11.130 --> 02:33:14.211]  You were saying you'd give me the name and number.
[02:33:15.012 --> 02:33:17.735]  I think she goes by, you said Liberty Bell, up in Dallas.
[02:33:17.735 --> 02:33:20.078]  So let me give her a call, just to let her know I'm going to be coming up there.
[02:33:20.078 --> 02:33:24.343]  Maybe I'll get her on in the next week or so before all this happens.
[02:33:24.343 --> 02:33:27.127]  But fire those websites out again, Gary.
[02:33:27.127 --> 02:33:32.734]  Okay, the place where you want to get organized and put information about the actions and the Fed.us
[02:33:33.875 --> 02:33:46.943]  Local groups are forming at RestoreTheRepublic.net, and then we're all using Republic Magazine, the grand theft America issue, for the tool to awaken the people at RepublicMagazines.com.
[02:33:46.943 --> 02:33:49.165]  Alright, Gary, we'll talk to you soon.
[02:33:49.165 --> 02:33:52.567]  Appreciate you coming up with this great idea.
[02:33:52.567 --> 02:33:53.048]  Thank you.
[02:33:53.048 --> 02:33:54.208]  It was a team effort.
[02:33:54.208 --> 02:33:54.629]  You bet.
[02:33:54.629 --> 02:33:57.931]  Well, I'm just curious, who did hatch the idea?
[02:33:59.012 --> 02:34:01.194]  It actually came from Steven Vincent.
[02:34:01.194 --> 02:34:08.861]  He was a California coordinator with the Ron Paul meet-ups and he approached me and I said, let's do this, let's blow this thing up, let's make it real.
[02:34:08.861 --> 02:34:13.945]  And, you know, we put the full weight and force of Aaron Russo's Restore the Republic behind it.
[02:34:13.945 --> 02:34:17.167]  And, you know, it's just gone viral from there.
[02:34:17.167 --> 02:34:19.730]  Yeah, I appreciate Ted Anderson running all those ads, too.
[02:34:19.730 --> 02:34:23.553]  I hope the listeners of this show take action.
[02:34:23.553 --> 02:34:24.834]  Okay, Gary, good to talk to you.
[02:34:25.549 --> 02:34:26.949]  Thank you Alex, thank you so much.
[02:34:26.949 --> 02:34:28.170]  You bet, I appreciate it.
[02:34:28.170 --> 02:34:44.134]  Okay, going back to another subject before Ralph Nader joins us, UponPrisonPlanet.com is a very important article written by Paul Watson and it says, Obama's civil defense program resembles domestic draft.
[02:34:44.134 --> 02:34:50.056]  And they say in the fine print in his Chief of Staff's book, and what Obama said, what Clinton proposed, what Bush proposed,
[02:34:50.822 --> 02:34:53.763]  You'll all be on the National Guard, and he says that.
[02:34:53.763 --> 02:34:55.044]  Rahm Emanuel says that.
[02:34:55.044 --> 02:35:04.648]  You'll get three months of military training, and they'll call you up for domestic roles, spying roles on fellow citizens, law enforcement roles, all of this.
[02:35:04.648 --> 02:35:05.508]  And that's only part of it.
[02:35:05.508 --> 02:35:08.650]  Then they've got the environmental brigades, millions and millions.
[02:35:08.650 --> 02:35:10.670]  I mean, just the Tattletail Squad's a million.
[02:35:12.655 --> 02:35:20.860]  More evidence has emerged, not just the video clips of him saying it, or his book, or Obama saying it, or Obama's own website saying it and being scrubbed.
[02:35:20.860 --> 02:35:24.462]  You know, look at him trying to hide it now because there's resistance.
[02:35:24.462 --> 02:35:31.206]  He told the New York Daily News in an interview, and this is, you know, in a cocktail party.
[02:35:31.206 --> 02:35:31.786]  This is in 2006.
[02:35:31.786 --> 02:35:35.148]  This ran on the New York Daily News website.
[02:35:35.148 --> 02:35:38.350]  This is their reporter talking to him, and listen carefully.
[02:35:40.325 --> 02:35:46.991]  This week from the Regency Hotel in Manhattan, where I sat down with Congressman Rahm Emanuel.
[02:35:46.991 --> 02:35:57.401]  He was at the Regency raising money for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which he chairs, and is also promoting his new book, which is called The Plan, in which he co-wrote with Bruce Reed.
[02:35:57.401 --> 02:36:01.765]  I wanted to ask you about the Universal Service piece of the plan.
[02:36:01.765 --> 02:36:02.986]  Can you tell me about it?
[02:36:02.986 --> 02:36:04.727]  Like, how's this going to work?
[02:36:04.727 --> 02:36:06.649]  Are people going to, particularly, are people going to live in barracks?
[02:36:08.481 --> 02:36:12.943]  Universal civil defense training.
[02:36:12.943 --> 02:36:17.765]  I think he had it at 18, but we're saying somewhere at the ages of 18 to 25, you will do three months of training.
[02:36:17.765 --> 02:36:21.087]  At some point in college, you just do that.
[02:36:21.087 --> 02:36:27.330]  But there could be nothing wrong with all Americans having a joint similar experience.
[02:36:28.130 --> 02:36:28.871]  We're good to go.
[02:36:44.506 --> 02:36:48.329]  It's a lot more than the US government asks of anybody right now.
[02:36:48.329 --> 02:36:50.250]  I mean, I guess you could argue that from taxes.
[02:36:50.250 --> 02:36:53.753]  So, but I don't mean to get hung up on the aesthetics of it, but like, uniforms and people
[02:37:06.863 --> 02:37:12.348]  If you're worried about doing 50 Jumping Jacks, the answer is yes.
[02:37:23.919 --> 02:37:30.505]  So is it going to be like, you know, you can go 9-5 to some course in the Red Cross building?
[02:37:30.505 --> 02:37:33.367]  I mean, the whole idea there is it will be worked on.
[02:37:33.367 --> 02:37:37.711]  You can do it through your state national guard to be the vehicle for that.
[02:37:37.711 --> 02:37:46.438]  The goal here wasn't to sit here and work on a piece of legislation for you and all that, but that's one venue to doing it.
[02:37:48.141 --> 02:37:53.345]  And would it, I mean I guess, would it, are you, if they have you some sort of glamour hung up on the barracks?
[02:37:53.345 --> 02:37:54.065]  Like is there a reason?
[02:37:54.065 --> 02:37:56.027]  Yeah, is there a reason you want to talk about?
[02:37:56.027 --> 02:37:56.727]  I don't know.
[02:37:56.727 --> 02:37:58.629]  Do you think... I'll have to turn the tape recorder off.
[02:37:58.629 --> 02:37:59.930]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:37:59.930 --> 02:38:02.351]  Do you have Blue Cross Blue Shield coverage on this?
[02:38:02.351 --> 02:38:05.093]  Are you worried about this in some capacity?
[02:38:05.093 --> 02:38:07.775]  No, I'm just, no, I'm just, I'm just here, I'm just trying to sort of imagine it.
[02:38:07.775 --> 02:38:13.880]  Well, rather than figure out whether you'd take a train ride or a barrack, think of it this way.
[02:38:14.740 --> 02:38:16.682]  We're all here for you, okay?
[02:38:16.682 --> 02:38:18.023]  It's a circle of life.
[02:38:43.540 --> 02:38:46.761]  Is this compulsory then?
[02:38:46.761 --> 02:38:50.562]  Well, you have to, in a sense, it's a required of everybody.
[02:38:50.562 --> 02:38:52.182]  18 to 25, 3 months.
[02:38:52.182 --> 02:38:55.103]  Alright, stop right there, back it up a few seconds.
[02:38:55.103 --> 02:39:08.406]  Now at the end it shifts from the New York Daily News story, and then it shifts into him on C-SPAN saying the same thing, it's going to be required, and then Barack Obama saying it's a domestic security force.
[02:39:09.304 --> 02:39:11.705]  The whole point here is, this is a national draft.
[02:39:11.705 --> 02:39:29.569]  If you read the fine print, it says it's for military, it's for domestic law enforcement, and then your school children have to be in these environmental brigades where the shared American experience is these multinational corporations and new world order system brainwashing your children into these youth corps.
[02:39:29.569 --> 02:39:33.230]  So, this is the opposite of true volunteerism.
[02:39:33.230 --> 02:39:36.911]  It's compulsory service, compulsory volunteerism.
[02:39:36.911 --> 02:39:38.011]  It's a Nazi moron
[02:39:38.849 --> 02:39:46.281]  Uh, but they know by imploding the economy, they know they force people into doing this.
[02:39:46.281 --> 02:39:50.548]  They know that by people not being able to have jobs, they're going to want to be part of this.
[02:39:51.474 --> 02:40:15.485]  uh... and uh... you know that's why the last five years they put the military recruiters in the high schools from texas to colorado to california caught on tape threatening saying i'm gonna have you arrested if you don't sign in the marines it's the law you have to join uh... so a lot of the kids they're getting a number one really the uh... low achievers low IQs they're being conned and and and and they're being lied to to be part of this
[02:40:16.212 --> 02:40:17.193]  So, this is all part of it.
[02:40:17.193 --> 02:40:18.775]  It's the law, you've got to take vaccines.
[02:40:18.775 --> 02:40:22.978]  It's the law, you've got to sign this contract to join the Marines or the Army.
[02:40:22.978 --> 02:40:38.012]  It's the law, you've got to... Well, now they really want to make it the law where you don't own your body, you don't control yourself, you don't own your children, you know, your children don't own you, you know, your family has no call on that, like the California's court said a few months ago.
[02:40:38.012 --> 02:40:40.835]  They said parents aren't the parents, the state is.
[02:40:44.079 --> 02:40:51.484]  So that's the type of issue that we are dealing with here.
[02:40:51.484 --> 02:40:55.226]  But the bigger issue isn't just the National Service.
[02:40:55.226 --> 02:40:58.228]  It's how they bring it out and then back off.
[02:40:58.228 --> 02:41:00.129]  And they bring it out and they back off.
[02:41:00.129 --> 02:41:01.710]  Always conditioning the public.
[02:41:01.710 --> 02:41:05.553]  And then lying about it, saying they never proposed it.
[02:41:05.553 --> 02:41:12.317]  When Emmanuel wrote his book, his bestseller about it, when he's the guy that pushed it in the first Clinton administration,
[02:41:14.941 --> 02:41:18.202]  And the second, from 93 through 2000.
[02:41:18.202 --> 02:41:25.344]  And he's the guy who ramrodded through NAFTA.
[02:41:25.344 --> 02:41:36.088]  So... It's just... It's hard to deal with a nation of people trained to be in denial.
[02:41:36.088 --> 02:41:38.909]  But at the same time, the population really isn't in denial now.
[02:41:38.909 --> 02:41:42.590]  I mean, we have the bailout, where we have
[02:41:47.478 --> 02:42:06.110]  Five trillion dollars, two million of it on the Federal Reserve books, that they're saying they won't even say who got it or where it went, and then in a press conference, Treasury Secretary Paulson comes out and says, it's secret who we're giving the money to, we don't have to tell anybody, but we have total transparency to the taxpayers, and this is all above board.
[02:42:06.110 --> 02:42:07.471]  I mean, that is total doublespeak.
[02:42:07.471 --> 02:42:11.954]  That's like breaking somebody's nose and saying, I didn't just punch you in the face.
[02:42:11.954 --> 02:42:17.258]  And then you're just busy, confused, thinking about the amazing lie you just heard.
[02:42:18.221 --> 02:42:26.227]  Uh, there is just a flaunting, a flaunting of corruption.
[02:42:26.227 --> 02:42:30.530]  John, how's it going getting Ralph Nader on?
[02:42:30.530 --> 02:42:35.194]  Yeah, they always get numbers scrambled around and he gets on about five minutes late, we run out of our time.
[02:42:35.194 --> 02:42:39.277]  That's the way it is with any busy people doing a lot of media.
[02:42:39.277 --> 02:42:44.301]  So, um, and then he gets on late with us because he's late on another interview.
[02:42:44.301 --> 02:42:45.662]  And then he's got to go early.
[02:42:47.344 --> 02:42:50.167]  Because he's late for another interview.
[02:42:50.167 --> 02:42:53.710]  So that's how that basically unfolds and how that works when the stuff gets stacked up.
[02:42:53.710 --> 02:43:12.005]  Regardless, I want to get a Ralph Nader's take on a lot of things that are happening and going on in the country and how Fox News really demonized him for saying, will Barack Obama be an Uncle Sam or an Uncle Tom?
[02:43:12.005 --> 02:43:13.867]  I mean, Uncle Tom is a term used
[02:43:14.668 --> 02:43:16.729]  By blacks who invented it.
[02:43:16.729 --> 02:43:26.936]  Well, the book, Uncle Tom's Cabin, when it got picked up, to deal with folks that go along with the system and sell out their people.
[02:43:26.936 --> 02:43:29.037]  And, of course, Nader didn't apologize.
[02:43:29.037 --> 02:43:31.378]  That's a historical fact.
[02:43:31.378 --> 02:43:39.864]  But pretty soon, reading or even being able to talk or even being able to have opposable thumbs will be seen as Al-Qaeda membership.
[02:43:39.864 --> 02:43:43.426]  It's kind of like 1984, where they reduced the language down
[02:43:44.770 --> 02:43:53.192]  So far, that the general public can't even be reached.
[02:43:53.192 --> 02:44:05.055]  I mean, a lot of people out there in society, they don't even know the branches of government, how society works, just what color is somebody, or what color tie are they wearing, or are they promising me a bunch of free stuff?
[02:44:05.055 --> 02:44:13.657]  And that's why the dumbing down has been so complete, that even though the public knows they're being lied to, they don't know what to do, or how to counter, or who the bad guys are.
[02:44:15.819 --> 02:44:18.840]  And that's where this show comes in.
[02:44:18.840 --> 02:44:28.944]  It's just that having a population that's domesticated, dumbed down, enslaved, is a recipe for disaster.
[02:44:28.944 --> 02:44:34.526]  Is a recipe for enslavement.
[02:44:34.526 --> 02:44:36.267]  And any time you have a population
[02:44:37.998 --> 02:44:52.110]  Who isn't aware of their enemies, or isn't aware of corruption, or doesn't have the will to fight back, or doesn't even have the weapons to fight back, whether that's intellectual weapons or physical weapons, they get overrun and enslaved.
[02:44:52.110 --> 02:44:56.113]  And that's what we face as a society today.
[02:44:56.113 --> 02:45:04.940]  I mean, not nowhere in any scale, in any time in history, has an elite stolen
[02:45:06.087 --> 02:45:11.028]  The amount of wealth they are stealing right now, and of course it's fiat wealth, but they're buying real assets with it.
[02:45:11.028 --> 02:45:16.229]  They're gonna leave the people holding the bag, paying it back in taxes, and of course in inflation.
[02:45:16.229 --> 02:45:24.251]  But, um, this is truly, truly unprecedented.
[02:45:24.251 --> 02:45:31.212]  And then I ask myself, every new outrage is topped by another outrage that comes after it.
[02:45:31.212 --> 02:45:34.493]  And then still another outrage, still another flaunting.
[02:45:35.916 --> 02:46:03.953]  So this is a scientific method of just flaunting corruption, training us to have no limits, to just expect anything and everything, and then the public just sheepishly has their expectations lowered down to nothing, and are mentally and psychologically prepared to acquiesce to any level of cultural depravity, enslavement, feudalism, serfdom, slavery.
[02:46:05.965 --> 02:46:17.349]  And they know they have a trendy population that is a mile wide and inch deep.
[02:46:17.349 --> 02:46:20.270]  There's no real substance.
[02:46:20.270 --> 02:46:23.212]  And the people have been demoralized.
[02:46:23.212 --> 02:46:32.295]  Maybe they weren't even ever moralized to begin with, to where they can just be fully thrown around like flotsam and jetsam.
[02:46:32.295 --> 02:46:34.876]  And so I don't know what to take from all of this.
[02:46:37.708 --> 02:46:41.131]  Other than the fact that we don't have a choice but to fight back.
[02:46:41.131 --> 02:46:51.561]  We don't have a choice but to resist, because the level of tyranny, as George Washington said, that we will live under, is the exact level we accept.
[02:46:51.561 --> 02:46:53.623]  I mean, the tyrant isn't going to stop.
[02:46:53.623 --> 02:46:55.165]  It's their nature to enjoy power.
[02:46:55.165 --> 02:46:56.986]  It's their nature to want to control.
[02:46:56.986 --> 02:47:00.009]  It's their nature to want to impoverish as a tool.
[02:47:00.009 --> 02:47:00.810]  A political tool.
[02:47:05.419 --> 02:47:09.560]  And so, we stand here at the crossroads.
[02:47:09.560 --> 02:47:19.982]  We have a scientific, military-industrial complex, media, big pharma system that is very decadent but also, at the same time, focused.
[02:47:19.982 --> 02:47:32.345]  And they have big management PR firms and psychological warfare firms and think tanks that have figured out how humans operate and how to play us off against each other, how to demoralize us, how to control us.
[02:47:33.636 --> 02:47:36.678]  And they are just devastating our society.
[02:47:36.678 --> 02:47:44.382]  They are laying waste as a tool of total siege and what you can call military domination.
[02:47:44.382 --> 02:47:48.624]  This is economic, military, cultural domination.
[02:47:48.624 --> 02:47:51.225]  I mean, the TV culture, just watch it.
[02:47:51.225 --> 02:47:59.950]  The pettiness, the greed, the hate, the backstabbing, the murders, the violence, all of it simulated and real.
[02:47:59.950 --> 02:48:02.451]  It's just oversensitizing us and
[02:48:03.433 --> 02:48:08.978]  To the point where we're desensitized to all of these horrors to ourselves and our fellow man.
[02:48:08.978 --> 02:48:14.883]  We've got to shake ourselves loose of this and realize just how crazy a world we're actually living in.
[02:48:14.883 --> 02:48:20.128]  To the point of realizing we have to get involved and somehow in the society change things.
[02:48:20.128 --> 02:48:21.969]  Alright, we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:21.969 --> 02:48:23.331]  See if we can get Ralph Nader on the horn.
[02:48:25.618 --> 02:48:40.418]  Now that the election is over and the shock is beginning to wear off, Ready Reserve Foods, in an effort to get as many Americans prepared for the promised changes of a new administration, and to help you and your family survive the global economic crash, Ready Reserve is offering the pre-inauguration special.
[02:48:40.418 --> 02:48:41.239]  We're good to
[02:49:02.381 --> 02:49:02.641]  I think so.
[02:49:24.568 --> 02:49:31.337]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:49:31.337 --> 02:49:33.981]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:49:33.981 --> 02:49:35.523]  But who is the enemy?
[02:49:35.523 --> 02:49:36.324]  Bin Laden.
[02:49:36.324 --> 02:49:37.345]  This is his ammo.
[02:49:37.345 --> 02:49:38.727]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:49:38.727 --> 02:49:39.288]  We have to look to...
[02:49:39.448 --> 02:49:43.532]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[02:49:43.532 --> 02:49:45.575]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:49:58.548 --> 02:50:08.633]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:50:08.633 --> 02:50:09.874]  Fabled Enemies.
[02:50:09.874 --> 02:50:17.597]  Get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:50:17.597 --> 02:50:20.979]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[02:50:24.414 --> 02:50:29.497]  Don't be a victim of sudden cardiac arrest due to inflammation of the arterial walls.
[02:50:29.497 --> 02:50:36.582]  Our hemp foods are anti-inflammatory and gluten-free and can greatly benefit the health of the human body.
[02:50:36.582 --> 02:50:44.947]  By calling 908-691-2608 or visiting hempusa.org, you can benefit from this wonderful natural food source.

[02:50:59.078 --> 02:51:07.644]  Hempusa.org believes that now is the time to plan for the future and food will be your greatest asset.
[02:51:07.644 --> 02:51:14.430]  People spend money on all kinds of things, but our warning is prepare now for food shortages in the future.
[02:51:15.265 --> 02:51:20.134]  So don't delay, call today, 908-691-2608 and see what our powder, seeds and oil can do for you!
[02:51:31.241 --> 02:51:32.182]  Alright, it's no big deal.
[02:51:32.182 --> 02:51:33.563]  This stuff happens all the time.
[02:51:33.563 --> 02:51:37.446]  His plane was late getting in, so he's stuck in traffic going to his office.
[02:51:37.446 --> 02:51:39.127]  I don't want to have him on for five minutes.
[02:51:39.127 --> 02:51:39.828]  We can do that.
[02:51:39.828 --> 02:51:42.810]  I'm just going to have Ralph Nader on tomorrow or the next day for like 30 minutes.
[02:51:42.810 --> 02:51:49.214]  We're going to have about 20 minutes with him to get into the banker bailout and really get into some serious issues.
[02:51:49.214 --> 02:51:50.976]  And why do I have people like Ralph Nader on?
[02:51:50.976 --> 02:51:57.321]  It's interesting to hear from him, his perspective, also all of his fans and people that respect him.
[02:51:57.321 --> 02:52:00.343]  So when I talk about the private banking system and the scam and how it's a fraud,
[02:52:01.149 --> 02:52:07.553]  You know, people pay attention, but the synergy of having Ralph Nader on as well, or Ron Paul.
[02:52:07.553 --> 02:52:10.314]  I mean, that Ron Paul interview I did last week.
[02:52:10.314 --> 02:52:13.016]  Hundreds of thousands of views alone on YouTube.
[02:52:13.016 --> 02:52:17.278]  And then it's all over hundreds of other video sites, and people take the audio and put it up there on the video.
[02:52:17.278 --> 02:52:26.604]  You know, another example of all these big guests adding to the synergy that, hey, a lot of Americans know the banks are running a scam.
[02:52:26.604 --> 02:52:27.984]  They know there's a new world order.
[02:52:29.901 --> 02:52:35.884]  The American people are aware that all of this corruption is taking place and transpiring.
[02:52:35.884 --> 02:52:45.069]  There's a lot of prominent people, Republicans, like Ron Paul, and folks you'd call liberal, like Ralph Nader, that know what's going on, that know both parties are controlled.
[02:52:45.069 --> 02:52:46.429]  It's all part of that process.
[02:52:46.429 --> 02:52:54.494]  But the good news is, we don't have another guest for about 34 minutes here, so I can talk to Jim, Alex, Herb, Michelle, Joe, Aaron, and many others.
[02:52:54.494 --> 02:52:57.055]  Folks from Florida, to British Columbia, to Hawaii.
[02:52:58.624 --> 02:53:10.890]  So we'll do that, but I have done two hours and 56 minutes here, and I haven't plugged any videos yet.
[02:53:10.890 --> 02:53:26.117]  And I need to do that, because not only do the videos and books that we sell on the secure online video and bookstore shopping cart at InfoWars.com, not only do they fund this operation and the important work we do here,
[02:53:27.697 --> 02:53:32.200]  As bad as things are, imagine how much worse it'd be if all of us weren't taking action.
[02:53:32.200 --> 02:53:35.462]  The most important reason is they wake people up.
[02:53:35.462 --> 02:53:37.764]  They're informative, they're dynamic.
[02:53:37.764 --> 02:53:41.406]  And everybody needs to have more information, more data, none of us know it all.
[02:53:41.406 --> 02:53:55.415]  But I know this, you may know quite a bit more than I do, but your neighbor, your friends, your family, your boss, your employees, your pastor, your rabbi, whatever, your imam, they don't know what's going on or they've only got a piece of it.
[02:53:55.415 --> 02:53:56.276]  And then thirdly,
[02:53:58.163 --> 02:54:04.525]  And this may be more important than just getting the word out, people are more receptive to the truth now than they've ever been.
[02:54:04.525 --> 02:54:13.287]  So it supports the show, it's powerful material, it's informative, and people are ready to receive it now like they have never been before.
[02:54:13.287 --> 02:54:23.429]  I mean, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, it really is the preeminent overall film to give you general knowledge on who the New World Order are, how they operate, and what their master plan is.
[02:54:25.908 --> 02:54:31.173]  Two-hour, forty-minute film with an hour of extras on one DVD.
[02:54:31.173 --> 02:54:33.395]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:54:33.395 --> 02:54:35.897]  Or Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[02:54:35.897 --> 02:54:39.420]  Or Truth Rising, or Fabled Enemies.
[02:54:39.420 --> 02:54:43.864]  All these videos need to be seen on high-quality DVD.
[02:54:43.864 --> 02:54:44.965]  Don't go to the stores.
[02:54:44.965 --> 02:54:50.110]  Don't blow your money on fruitcakes and ties or Star Wars toys nobody wants.
[02:54:50.976 --> 02:55:00.138]  Give the gift of a high-quality DVD in a beautiful package with a nice cover that reads like an adventure movie, and give it to your friends, your neighbor, your family.
[02:55:00.138 --> 02:55:06.780]  Tell them, hey, watch this, and it's a great film, but also don't give me anything.
[02:55:06.780 --> 02:55:09.520]  Your present to me is that you will watch this.
[02:55:09.520 --> 02:55:12.241]  But frankly, the way psychology works, then they won't want to watch it.
[02:55:12.241 --> 02:55:13.421]  They'll think of it as work.
[02:55:13.421 --> 02:55:16.802]  Tell them, man, this is radical and riveting and really crazy.
[02:55:16.802 --> 02:55:17.602]  What do you think of it?
[02:55:18.931 --> 02:55:19.852]  And that's the best way.
[02:55:19.852 --> 02:55:21.933]  So, InfoWars.com.

[02:55:26.836 --> 02:55:27.576]  Who they are.
[02:55:27.576 --> 02:55:28.377]  How they operate.
[02:55:28.377 --> 02:55:29.838]  The Rothschilds.
[02:55:29.838 --> 02:55:31.739]  1995.
[02:55:31.739 --> 02:55:34.040]  Two DVDs.
[02:55:34.040 --> 02:55:34.120]  1995.

[02:56:25.284 --> 02:56:27.065]  America, freedom to fascism.

[02:56:47.895 --> 02:57:08.024]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:57:08.024 --> 02:57:09.545]  We're live at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:57:12.282 --> 02:57:23.111]  As we are every day in the fourth hour, some days we do the whole show, other days two or three hours, but always at least one hour a day at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:57:23.111 --> 02:57:23.792]  I'm feeling good.
[02:57:23.792 --> 02:57:27.635]  I'm getting over that chest cold I've had the last four or five days.
[02:57:27.635 --> 02:57:28.936]  And we're taking your phone calls.
[02:57:28.936 --> 02:57:31.198]  I've covered a whole lot of issues.
[02:57:31.198 --> 02:57:36.903]  I mean, the private banks are saying we've taken trillions of dollars out of the Treasury, taxpayer money.
[02:57:36.903 --> 02:57:38.505]  We're not going to tell you who we gave it to.
[02:57:40.563 --> 02:57:43.546]  They're calling that transparency.
[02:57:43.546 --> 02:57:46.028]  They got this new Bretton Woods agreement coming up.
[02:57:46.028 --> 02:58:00.241]  Out of that framework, Lord Rothschild, the head of the Rothschild family, is in the major newspaper saying, and I'm going to show that to folks on the document cam later in the show, openly saying,
[02:58:01.394 --> 02:58:07.042]  That they're setting up a new world order and that it's a global government.
[02:58:07.042 --> 02:58:09.927]  That the new world order is global government.
[02:58:11.001 --> 02:58:11.321]  Alex?
[02:58:11.321 --> 02:58:11.922]  Can you hear me?
[02:58:35.049 --> 02:58:39.572]  I think you're probably aware of Obama's use of NLP techniques in his speeches.
[02:58:58.085 --> 02:59:06.653]  I think everybody, once they, there's an article on Rince.com right now, an examination of Obama's use of hidden hypnosis techniques in his speeches.
[02:59:06.653 --> 02:59:09.315]  It's like 67 pages long.
[02:59:09.315 --> 02:59:11.658]  Yeah, we posted that a few weeks ago.
[02:59:11.658 --> 02:59:12.999]  It's a must-read.
[02:59:12.999 --> 02:59:19.445]  It's an absolute must-read to understand how satanically manipulative this man is.
[02:59:19.445 --> 02:59:20.966]  He's very dangerous.
[02:59:22.888 --> 02:59:35.685]  He's going to be, who knows what sort of tricks he's going to be playing because he talked about this French Revolution spirit that they're trying to build in us to set off that
[02:59:36.610 --> 02:59:40.354]  That's a terrible conflagration that I think Albert Pike talks about.
[02:59:40.354 --> 02:59:41.375]  Or a lawyer or whatever, you know.
[02:59:57.901 --> 03:00:09.846]  Yeah, and another thing I wanted to know is, there's a bill on the floor of Congress right now, from what I understand of it, for a draft of people 18 to 49, you're probably aware of that too, right?
[03:00:09.846 --> 03:00:23.591]  Yeah, they've been reintroducing that for the last decade under Congressman Rangel, and then he's got 50-something co-sponsors, last time I checked, and people just say, we're lying, it doesn't exist, even as Barack Obama announces they want to push it.
[03:00:24.605 --> 03:00:28.468]  Well, what are your plans to do when they... because you're in that age group, Alex.
[03:00:28.468 --> 03:00:30.370]  What are you going to do?
[03:00:30.370 --> 03:00:32.352]  Well, I'm not going to be joining.
[03:00:32.352 --> 03:00:34.194]  I'm not anybody's slave.
[03:00:34.194 --> 03:00:36.696]  And I'm not going to be part of any tattletale squad.
[03:00:36.696 --> 03:00:42.201]  But see, they're going to find lots of folks that want to wear black uniforms and want to spy on their neighbors.
[03:00:42.201 --> 03:00:45.564]  That's why we told you they'd have checkpoints and bus stops and trains and...
[03:00:47.095 --> 03:01:13.482]  Yeah, it's shocking to me that a group of all these millions of people could be convinced to vote for a man who has no accomplishments in his life and even a cursory examination of his past shows involvement with all sorts of
[03:01:16.577 --> 03:01:20.200]  Well, still, he's a puppet, and it's shocking to people this could happen.
[03:01:31.750 --> 03:01:51.999]  Then the New World Order will get a new lease on life with a new puppet, and then we'll learn that that puppet's bad because they worked for the bankers and not us, and then there'll be another puppet, and then we'll have to learn that's a bad puppet, but then we'll accept the new puppet as not being a puppet, and then we'll find out they're a puppet, and then they'll give us a new person, and we'll be fooled by that and take a few years to figure out they're a puppet.
[03:01:51.999 --> 03:01:52.620]  We'll be right back.
[03:01:53.359 --> 03:01:55.040]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[03:01:55.040 --> 03:01:59.785]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:01:59.785 --> 03:02:02.747]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:02:02.747 --> 03:02:05.790]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:02:05.790 --> 03:02:10.514]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[03:02:10.734 --> 03:02:11.914]  If you simply prepare.
[03:02:11.914 --> 03:02:15.655]  Our elected representatives wanted a good ol' boy bailout for the special interest.
[03:02:15.655 --> 03:02:17.715]  So they ignored your screams not to do it.
[03:02:17.715 --> 03:02:19.556]  They turned off the telephones and email.
[03:02:19.556 --> 03:02:23.516]  They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air.
[03:02:23.516 --> 03:02:26.337]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[03:02:26.337 --> 03:02:35.478]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities, particularly food, beyond many Americans' reach.
[03:02:35.478 --> 03:02:39.959]  In pre-Nazi Germany superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days.
[03:02:40.219 --> 03:02:42.560]  Until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[03:02:42.560 --> 03:02:47.003]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast, there seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[03:02:47.003 --> 03:02:52.706]  The private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[03:02:52.706 --> 03:02:55.947]  The stores have less food, but jack up prices to stay in business.
[03:02:55.947 --> 03:02:59.089]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[03:02:59.289 --> 03:03:01.111]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[03:03:01.111 --> 03:03:05.194]  One-third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[03:03:05.194 --> 03:03:09.318]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food.
[03:03:09.318 --> 03:03:16.865]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the new old order, has a lot less control over you.
[03:03:16.865 --> 03:03:20.808]  And so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.

[03:04:00.830 --> 03:04:06.231]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:04:06.231 --> 03:04:08.492]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:04:29.178 --> 03:04:31.900]  Eight minutes, twenty-five seconds into this fourth and final hour.
[03:04:31.900 --> 03:04:41.908]  Larry Pratt to discuss the record gun sales, smashing all previous records nationwide as people go out and buy up guns in anticipation of more gun control.
[03:04:41.908 --> 03:04:45.891]  But that'll come after the controlled economic implosion, the controlled rioting
[03:04:47.563 --> 03:05:13.538]  uh... the troops on the streets see the globalist know how to the social engineers know how to make you bag for their tyranny uh... but uh... right now let's go back to your calls and quickly alex in new york you're on the air welcome what alex they were a let him go her but atlanta you're on the air go ahead you know hello sir go ahead
[03:05:14.881 --> 03:05:18.542]  Hey, Muppets and Puppets and Demons, oh my!
[03:05:18.542 --> 03:05:21.283]  You're covering it all today, buddy!
[03:05:21.283 --> 03:05:23.443]  But you know something, Alex?
[03:05:23.443 --> 03:05:29.525]  I'm getting physically ill looking at all politicians except Ron Paul.
[03:05:29.525 --> 03:05:32.345]  Let me say something about Ron Paul right quick.
[03:05:32.345 --> 03:05:41.968]  I read in an article that he made a passionate plea on the floor of the House of Representatives to get rid of the Federal Reserve System, to repeal the Federal Reserve System.
[03:05:41.968 --> 03:05:43.448]  He also called for their arrest.
[03:05:44.537 --> 03:05:44.837]  Absolutely not!
[03:05:44.837 --> 03:05:50.760]  I think it's utterly pathetic that these people are now claiming that they have some kind of sovereign authority that
[03:06:09.678 --> 03:06:14.381]  They're above the law, and all of this crap was set up during a lame duck session of Congress.
[03:06:14.381 --> 03:06:19.484]  I've tried to tell people this, yet they control everything about the U.S.
[03:06:19.484 --> 03:06:21.325]  economy, and you know what?
[03:06:21.325 --> 03:06:34.974]  That is why our government, as you say, is basically corrupt and illegitimate, because the inter-share politicians, they are elected based on what they're willing to do for the Federal Reserve System.
[03:06:36.346 --> 03:06:41.691]  And I'm going to ask you a quick question about Barkey Obama before I ask you about Rambo Emanuel.
[03:06:41.691 --> 03:06:51.441]  Now, do you think that they're going to, the CIA is going to somehow magically produce a copy of this birth certificate, and if they do that, what about his medical records that have been sealed?
[03:06:53.393 --> 03:06:54.915]  You know, I don't know what's going to happen.
[03:06:54.915 --> 03:06:59.701]  In a way, whether he's an American or not, I'm not saying it's a distraction or a diversion.
[03:06:59.701 --> 03:07:01.504]  It's a substantive issue.
[03:07:01.504 --> 03:07:04.928]  But it becomes a red herring from just the issues he supports.
[03:07:04.928 --> 03:07:07.732]  Total banker, takeover of the society,
[03:07:08.513 --> 03:07:23.668]  Uh, domestic drafts, police squads, tattletale squads, carbon taxes that will fully bankrupt our economy and that will make more carbon be produced because it will make all the industry go to India and China where they have no
[03:07:24.629 --> 03:07:25.989]  carbon restrictions.
[03:07:25.989 --> 03:07:47.274]  I mean, even if you believe that carbon dioxide is a deadly chemical weapon that must be banned, oh goodness, plants breathe it, which of course is pure bull, but let's just say that's true, then why would you do what the government studies show would actually increase the overall output of CO2, because it'll just cause it to move to the third world nations that aren't under this.
[03:07:47.274 --> 03:07:48.474]  This is a tax.
[03:07:48.474 --> 03:07:49.514]  This is control.
[03:07:49.514 --> 03:07:52.715]  So that's why I'm really most against Barack Obama.
[03:07:53.998 --> 03:08:10.985]  When you were talking with Jack McLam about the female preachers, he mentioned that when the government goes after, I want you all to hear me very well, when the government goes after the Second Amendment, then that's when they will get their war for the damn Republic.
[03:08:10.985 --> 03:08:14.967]  Now, it's time to have Jack McLam back on.
[03:08:15.737 --> 03:08:23.439]  Because now this is exactly what these propagandist, illegitimate demons are talking about through this Rambo Emanuel.
[03:08:23.439 --> 03:08:24.679]  Who gave him this name?
[03:08:24.679 --> 03:08:27.000]  The name Emanuel means God with us.
[03:08:27.000 --> 03:08:30.261]  We've got dressed up demons amongst us, Alex.
[03:08:30.261 --> 03:08:32.141]  As far as these politicians are concerned.
[03:08:32.141 --> 03:08:33.942]  That's my honest assessment.
[03:08:33.942 --> 03:08:38.743]  Yeah, Ram Emanuel means high with God or in the high place with God.
[03:08:38.743 --> 03:08:41.104]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[03:08:41.104 --> 03:08:44.645]  I want to go through some news here in a minute and also show it to you here on the document cam.
[03:08:46.148 --> 03:08:47.148]  But we'll do that later.
[03:08:47.148 --> 03:08:49.749]  Let's continue with your calls right now.
[03:08:49.749 --> 03:08:54.471]  Let's talk to Michelle in British Columbia.
[03:08:54.471 --> 03:08:55.731]  You're on the air.
[03:08:55.731 --> 03:08:57.751]  Actually, Michelle and Joe dropped off.
[03:08:57.751 --> 03:08:58.992]  Okay.
[03:08:58.992 --> 03:09:01.693]  These callers call in and they drop right off.
[03:09:01.693 --> 03:09:03.113]  Erin in Hawaii.
[03:09:03.113 --> 03:09:05.094]  You're on the air.
[03:09:05.094 --> 03:09:06.214]  Hi there, Alex.
[03:09:06.214 --> 03:09:07.234]  Hi.
[03:09:07.234 --> 03:09:08.935]  I really appreciate what you're doing.
[03:09:11.013 --> 03:09:21.298]  You give me a lot of incentive to contact the senators and the reps here in Hawaii and trying to explain to them what is going on.
[03:09:21.298 --> 03:09:30.823]  My husband and I called and we're completely against the bailout and basically we're just talking to their aides.
[03:09:30.823 --> 03:09:34.064]  I've got different reactions depending on which office.
[03:09:34.064 --> 03:09:37.766]  Everything from screaming back at me and hanging up on me to
[03:09:39.310 --> 03:09:45.872]  One of them saying that they will personally call me back on the 17th.
[03:09:45.872 --> 03:09:53.735]  Just trying to let them know, let my neighbors know here that we know what's going on.
[03:09:53.735 --> 03:09:57.136]  That all of this has been engineered.
[03:09:57.136 --> 03:10:02.238]  They want to take away our sovereignty.
[03:10:02.238 --> 03:10:02.878]  It's frightening.
[03:10:03.948 --> 03:10:23.981]  And here in Maui, it was very strange, you know, because Obama, you know, supposedly was born over on Oahu, and it's real funny because Governor Lingle here sealed his birth, supposedly sealed his birth records, and supposed to remain that way until after the election.
[03:10:23.981 --> 03:10:28.764]  However, the issue just seemed to have been forgotten about, even locally here.
[03:10:30.990 --> 03:10:36.171]  And then I heard that the Kenyan government also was sealing things.
[03:10:36.171 --> 03:10:38.252]  Because possibly he was really bored in Kenya.
[03:10:38.252 --> 03:10:47.013]  Yes, they've been sealing and hiding it and acting very, very suspicious, which is never a good sign, is it?
[03:10:47.013 --> 03:10:48.254]  Oh, no, sir.
[03:10:48.254 --> 03:10:49.214]  No, sir.
[03:10:49.214 --> 03:10:54.035]  There's no reason for the governor to seal something like that.
[03:10:54.035 --> 03:11:00.056]  Just the fact that she said they were sealing it is really, to me, an omission that
[03:11:01.688 --> 03:11:05.229]  He really isn't a citizen.
[03:11:05.229 --> 03:11:16.212]  The private school that he went to, Oahu, here, I forget the name of it, it's in Hawaii, Honoho, I think, it's like $15,000 a year.
[03:11:16.212 --> 03:11:24.055]  How could his family have afforded, if he was a single mom on food stamps and this and
[03:11:25.677 --> 03:11:26.318]  No, no.
[03:11:26.318 --> 03:11:30.260]  The guy is a foundation creation from day one.
[03:11:30.260 --> 03:11:33.041]  I appreciate your call.
[03:11:33.041 --> 03:11:33.822]  Good to hear from you.
[03:11:33.822 --> 03:11:42.626]  We're going to take more calls coming up and we're going to have Larry Pratt on with us, but it was good to hear from you, Aaron, in Hawaii.
[03:11:42.626 --> 03:11:44.968]  Here's that Bloomberg report I talked about yesterday.
[03:11:46.218 --> 03:11:49.941]  Fed Defies Transparency Aim and Refusal to Identify Bank Loans
[03:12:17.118 --> 03:12:31.722]  The University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna did a study with mice and found that it sterilized them and lowered their birth weights and caused all sorts of problems with just one type of Monsanto maize.
[03:12:31.722 --> 03:12:38.603]  So I wanted to show that to everybody who's watching at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:12:38.603 --> 03:12:45.405]  The headline there, of course, is Genetically Modified Maize Lowers Fertility in Mice Study Finds
[03:12:46.906 --> 03:13:06.403]  This is one of the big newspapers over in the United Arab Emirates, it's the National, and they had a big global meeting on the future of banking there last week, or over the weekend, and guess who was there?
[03:13:06.403 --> 03:13:06.983]  This guy,
[03:13:08.618 --> 03:13:13.620]  Baron David de Rothschild, the head of the Rothschild Bank.
[03:13:13.620 --> 03:13:18.961]  The Rothschilds have helped the British government since financing Wellington's army to fight the French in 1815.
[03:13:18.961 --> 03:13:22.403]  That's actually when they bankrupted it by design.
[03:13:22.403 --> 03:13:30.045]  And they actually admit that in the article and say that this guy basically runs world banking.
[03:13:30.045 --> 03:13:35.107]  Then they have him bragging about how they're setting up a New World Order world government.
[03:13:37.270 --> 03:14:03.004]  out of this crisis the first barons of banking is that headline for everybody out there that wants to check it out and then you can open it up to the second page and it gets into the new world order it gets into global government it's all right there in the article uh... for anybody that uh...
[03:14:05.134 --> 03:14:06.075]  that wants to read it.
[03:14:06.075 --> 03:14:11.320]  It's all there for the people that want to see it.
[03:14:11.320 --> 03:14:14.023]  So there's that report.
[03:14:14.023 --> 03:14:16.526]  Continuing, Russia is rejecting U.S.
[03:14:16.526 --> 03:14:22.933]  missile proposals, and that's out of Reuters.
[03:14:24.671 --> 03:14:32.316]  The United States and NATO have moved all sorts of weapons systems and systems to shoot down Russian missiles right up against their border.
[03:14:32.316 --> 03:14:36.258]  In Poland, Czechoslovakia, Ukraine, Georgia.
[03:14:36.258 --> 03:14:43.583]  And NATO admits in its doctrine... That was a good move there.
[03:14:43.583 --> 03:14:46.725]  I've still got a cold here a little bit, folks.
[03:14:46.725 --> 03:14:47.345]  So bear with me.
[03:14:52.145 --> 03:14:53.725]  We're going to punch this up on screen.
[03:14:53.725 --> 03:14:55.226]  Here you go.
[03:14:55.226 --> 03:14:56.646]  Russia rejects U.S.
[03:14:56.646 --> 03:14:58.226]  missile proposal.
[03:14:58.226 --> 03:15:01.447]  The Kremlin on Wednesday rejected U.S.
[03:15:01.447 --> 03:15:15.849]  proposals aimed at easing concerns over a missile defense system in Europe and said it would try again to resolve the fight once Barack Obama is in the White House.
[03:15:15.849 --> 03:15:17.149]  Russia says the planned U.S.
[03:15:17.149 --> 03:15:21.010]  system will threaten its national security and that the administration of George Bush
[03:15:21.994 --> 03:15:35.846]  which leaves office in January has failed to allay its concerns and then they in an asinine fashion come out and say
[03:15:39.332 --> 03:15:42.074]  That it's for Iran to fight terrorists.
[03:15:42.074 --> 03:15:45.678]  So they're just stirring up wars with Russia.
[03:15:45.678 --> 03:15:51.523]  By the way, Barack Obama has announced he's going to have lobbyists in his administration and donors.
[03:15:51.523 --> 03:15:59.350]  That was all lies, and he's not getting rid of Guantanamo Bay, and he's not getting out of Iraq, and he's not getting rid of torture, and he's not getting rid of warrantless wiretapping.
[03:16:01.309 --> 03:16:07.551]  Ionic Zone has the lowest prices in the USA on shock treatment ozone generators starting at $299.
[03:16:07.551 --> 03:16:21.496]  Ionic Zone shock treatment ozone generators are used by remediation contractors and homeowners alike to sterilize homes and cars, making them free from bacteria, molds, viruses, and complete removal of secondhand smoke, pet odors, you name it.
[03:16:21.496 --> 03:16:25.037]  What else can three oxygen atoms, in other words, ozone, do?
[03:16:25.037 --> 03:16:29.519]  Many hospitals sterilize their operating rooms with ozone before and after operations.
[03:16:29.799 --> 03:16:30.019]  I think.
[03:16:44.656 --> 03:16:47.697]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[03:16:47.697 --> 03:16:48.597]  And we knew what to do.
[03:16:48.597 --> 03:16:50.037]  Or at least we thought we did.
[03:16:50.037 --> 03:16:51.757]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film.
[03:17:13.334 --> 03:17:17.499]  It finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[03:17:17.499 --> 03:17:25.989]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[03:17:26.397 --> 03:17:33.501]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[03:17:33.501 --> 03:17:36.662]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[03:17:36.662 --> 03:17:42.445]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[03:17:42.445 --> 03:17:45.506]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[03:17:55.247 --> 03:17:55.467]  I think so.

[03:20:14.033 --> 03:20:16.394]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[03:20:16.394 --> 03:20:19.275]  Going out on the AM and FM dial, global shortwave of the internet.
[03:20:19.275 --> 03:20:25.239]  Don't forget the free podcast downloaded by over 105,000 people a day and growing Monday through Sunday.
[03:20:26.644 --> 03:20:29.045]  Only day off is Saturday.
[03:20:29.045 --> 03:20:30.946]  Free podcast, six days a week.
[03:20:30.946 --> 03:20:34.127]  Listen to how you want, where you want, when you want.
[03:20:34.127 --> 03:20:38.469]  Very thankful to all the listeners and people that love liberty and hate tyranny.
[03:20:38.469 --> 03:20:43.472]  Okay, I've got a lot of callers here, and I got my callers scrambled earlier.
[03:20:43.472 --> 03:20:46.273]  Who's been holding the longest here, John?
[03:20:46.273 --> 03:20:47.253]  Michelle in B.C.
[03:20:47.253 --> 03:20:47.894]  Colbert.
[03:20:47.894 --> 03:20:49.654]  Okay, Michelle in B.C.
[03:20:49.654 --> 03:20:51.935]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[03:20:51.935 --> 03:20:53.136]  Hi, Alex.
[03:20:53.136 --> 03:20:53.436]  Hi.
[03:20:53.436 --> 03:20:55.497]  I hope you're feeling better.
[03:20:56.471 --> 03:21:02.153]  And I've been awakened all this only for about six months and I'm 43 years old.
[03:21:02.153 --> 03:21:05.674]  I should have had this information much sooner in my life.
[03:21:05.674 --> 03:21:09.116]  Anyways, I also want to mention I just recently subscribed to your show.
[03:21:09.116 --> 03:21:10.556]  I've bought some of your videos.
[03:21:10.556 --> 03:21:12.177]  I'm planning on buying more for Christmas.
[03:21:12.177 --> 03:21:15.298]  This will be my Christmas gift to people.
[03:21:15.298 --> 03:21:24.061]  But one thing I wanted to ask you about is up here Canadians tend, I don't know, they think that the Bank of Canada
[03:21:24.651 --> 03:21:51.534]  is controlled by the government of Canada and in the research I've done back in I think it was 72 all of that was turned over to the same thugs actually Mark Carney is the governor of the Bank of Canada who served as director for Goldman Sachs yes the Bank of Canada has governmental power but its profits are private and it is a private
[03:21:52.785 --> 03:22:00.574]  Chartered Bank, just like in 1913, our Federal Reserve, our parasite, you know, it's like my cancer.
[03:22:00.574 --> 03:22:02.396]  You know, I talk about it possessively.
[03:22:02.396 --> 03:22:05.299]  It's not our military, it's not our police, it's the New World Orders.
[03:22:05.299 --> 03:22:09.764]  I'm not saying they're individually bad, but the system itself is evil.
[03:22:09.764 --> 03:22:13.468]  So I have to semantically myself reprogram myself to really use proper terms.
[03:22:14.687 --> 03:22:23.711]  But the Federal Reserve is private, and the Bank of England is private, the Bundesbank is private, and it is the same families that own it.
[03:22:23.711 --> 03:22:26.432]  It's the Dutch, the British Royalty, the Rothschilds.
[03:22:26.432 --> 03:22:30.653]  It's less than 20 families that own the shares in these.
[03:22:30.653 --> 03:22:34.575]  Let me play you, in case you missed it in the first hour, I said I'd play this again.
[03:22:34.575 --> 03:22:36.976]  This is two nights ago, Laird News Hour.
[03:22:36.976 --> 03:22:38.717]  This is Alan Greenspan saying,
[03:22:39.457 --> 03:22:50.144]  But saying it's a good thing, that the Federal Reserve isn't under Congress, the President, it is an agency unto itself, with no oversight, as if that is the American way.
[03:22:50.144 --> 03:22:52.685]  No checks and balances, here it is.
[03:22:52.685 --> 03:23:00.970]  What is the proper relationship, what should be the proper relationship between a chairman of the Fed and a president of the United States?
[03:23:00.970 --> 03:23:08.775]  Well, first of all, the Federal Reserve is an independent agency, and that means basically that there is no
[03:23:09.599 --> 03:23:09.819]  I think?
[03:23:25.718 --> 03:23:34.567]  is requesting that we do things other than what we think is the appropriate thing, then what the relationships are don't frankly matter.
[03:23:34.567 --> 03:23:38.230]  And I've had very good relationships with the President.
[03:23:38.230 --> 03:23:50.382]  Alright, amazing spin, implying with semantics it's federal but never saying it, and then saying that as long as government has no oversight, as long as government
[03:23:51.164 --> 03:23:52.545]  Has no say.
[03:23:52.545 --> 03:23:53.886]  The Fed is legitimate.
[03:23:53.886 --> 03:23:55.787]  You can go watch the whole clip online.
[03:23:55.787 --> 03:23:57.248]  It's like five minutes.
[03:23:57.248 --> 03:23:59.509]  But, I mean, it's a private group.
[03:23:59.509 --> 03:24:02.851]  They control the issuance of currency and liquidity and credit.
[03:24:02.851 --> 03:24:13.417]  They can cut it off, then terrorize the Congress into giving their private banks trillions of dollars, and then they tell us, we said you could look at what we did, but we're not going to tell you anything we did.
[03:24:13.417 --> 03:24:15.158]  It's all secret.
[03:24:15.158 --> 03:24:17.940]  So, it's a new level of corruption, Michelle.
[03:24:19.065 --> 03:24:24.651]  Alex, I get that and it sounds like a lot of Americans are starting to get that.
[03:24:24.651 --> 03:24:29.235]  The issue for me is Canadians just aren't buying it.
[03:24:29.235 --> 03:24:33.820]  I'm fully aware of this and when I post comments on cbc.ca
[03:24:35.069 --> 03:24:41.056]  You know, there'll be like ten pages of replies and only about three posters there where you can see, get it.
[03:24:41.056 --> 03:24:44.320]  Well, that's because they're invested in the system.
[03:24:44.320 --> 03:24:45.381]  They're in denial.
[03:24:45.381 --> 03:24:47.203]  They're invested in the system.
[03:24:47.203 --> 03:24:51.749]  They don't want to admit bad people are robbing them and so they just say it's not true.
[03:24:53.050 --> 03:25:00.394]  As things get worse and worse, they're going to remember what you said in British Columbia, Michelle.
[03:25:00.394 --> 03:25:02.435]  They're going to remember what I said in Austin, Texas.
[03:25:02.435 --> 03:25:07.857]  They're going to remember what people said in London, in Germany, in Japan, in Russia, in Mexico.
[03:25:07.857 --> 03:25:09.618]  And there are more people taking action.
[03:25:09.618 --> 03:25:10.939]  I appreciate your call.
[03:25:10.939 --> 03:25:12.679]  So just continue on warning them.
[03:25:12.679 --> 03:25:15.081]  They're going to laugh, but later they're going to remember.
[03:25:17.099 --> 03:25:21.284]  I keep meaning to plug this, and by plug it, I mean I want to just commend these guys.
[03:25:21.284 --> 03:25:32.477]  There are so many 9-11 truth groups, so many We Are Change groups, so many groups doing yeoman's work of getting involved, confronting politicians, getting out there and educating people.
[03:25:33.078 --> 03:25:36.941]  Getting out there and getting off their butts and turning the tide.
[03:25:36.941 --> 03:25:38.582]  And we are Change San Antonio.
[03:25:38.582 --> 03:25:40.503]  We posted some of their videos yesterday.
[03:25:40.503 --> 03:25:42.024]  The persecution they're going through.
[03:25:42.024 --> 03:25:46.687]  I want to salute those three young men down there in San Antonio, Texas.
[03:25:46.687 --> 03:25:47.307]  Great job.
[03:25:47.307 --> 03:25:50.970]  We'll be right back with Larry Pratt.
[03:25:50.970 --> 03:25:52.351]  We're on the march.
[03:25:52.351 --> 03:25:53.852]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:25:54.864 --> 03:25:57.865]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:25:57.865 --> 03:26:00.906]  Yeah, I'm going to keep going and go ahead and talk to John during the break.
[03:26:00.906 --> 03:26:02.767]  Hey, John?
[03:26:02.767 --> 03:26:03.687]  Yes, sir?
[03:26:03.687 --> 03:26:08.008]  Have you got Pratt on ISDN line?
[03:26:08.008 --> 03:26:12.550]  Yep, I'm going to have to disconnect the backup line and then connect him right now on that.
[03:26:12.550 --> 03:26:13.210]  All right, great.
[03:26:13.210 --> 03:26:15.111]  And then go ahead and get his audio up and everything.
[03:26:15.111 --> 03:26:18.712]  He always has it low.
[03:26:18.712 --> 03:26:21.193]  And we'll talk to everybody out there.
[03:26:22.447 --> 03:26:23.898]  Okay, pal.
[03:26:23.898 --> 03:26:24.806]  Thanks.
[03:26:24.806 --> 03:26:25.350]  Sure, no problem.
[03:26:37.421 --> 03:26:41.824]  Use them and love them, knowing they're all natural and safe, and I say big time.
[03:26:41.824 --> 03:26:43.065]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[03:26:43.065 --> 03:26:43.305]  That's 1-800-340-7091.

[03:27:00.808 --> 03:27:07.571]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:27:07.571 --> 03:27:10.192]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:27:10.192 --> 03:27:11.752]  But who is the enemy?
[03:27:11.752 --> 03:27:12.553]  Bin Laden.
[03:27:12.553 --> 03:27:13.493]  This is his ammo.
[03:27:13.493 --> 03:27:14.894]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:27:14.894 --> 03:27:16.895]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:27:16.895 --> 03:27:24.057]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:27:24.057 --> 03:27:24.538]  Some U.S.
[03:27:24.538 --> 03:27:30.180]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:27:30.880 --> 03:27:34.763]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:27:34.763 --> 03:27:44.870]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[03:27:44.870 --> 03:27:46.091]  Fabled enemies.

[03:27:53.856 --> 03:27:57.219]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[03:28:01.329 --> 03:28:04.571]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[03:28:04.571 --> 03:28:10.214]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[03:28:10.214 --> 03:28:11.755]  Supreme Court.
[03:28:11.755 --> 03:28:16.098]  Yet on February 29, 1892, in an I-nothing decision of the U.S.
[03:28:16.098 --> 03:28:20.681]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[03:28:20.681 --> 03:28:25.904]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.
[03:28:26.727 --> 03:28:36.590]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[03:28:36.590 --> 03:28:38.370]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[03:28:38.370 --> 03:28:38.730]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[03:28:50.655 --> 03:28:51.397]  Call now.

[03:29:22.114 --> 03:29:25.437]  There is more and more guerrilla media taking place.
[03:29:25.437 --> 03:29:30.000]  Somebody put out 1.5 million fake New York Post papers.
[03:29:30.000 --> 03:29:33.443]  Must have been a big organization.
[03:29:33.443 --> 03:29:37.607]  With the headline, Iraq War Over.
[03:29:37.607 --> 03:29:40.889]  Bush Arrested.
[03:29:40.889 --> 03:29:46.134]  And it's those type of things that will shock people out of their catatonic state.
[03:29:48.325 --> 03:30:05.670]  Getting my films, my books, my videos, the materials we carry, getting them out to people, making copies of them, other materials, other information, starting your own local radio show, starting a website, a blog, an audio blog, a video blog, fighting for internet freedom.
[03:30:05.670 --> 03:30:11.711]  In fact, let's punch up the PrisonPlanet.tv document cam.
[03:30:11.711 --> 03:30:14.012]  I want to show folks shots of the New York
[03:30:15.145 --> 03:30:18.227]  It was the New York Times.
[03:30:18.227 --> 03:30:20.729]  The guys were telling me about it during the break, reading me the headline.
[03:30:20.729 --> 03:30:22.430]  They told me the New York Post for some reason.
[03:30:22.430 --> 03:30:25.492]  It's the New York Times, so that's why I ran in and told you about this.
[03:30:25.492 --> 03:30:26.853]  But here it is.
[03:30:26.853 --> 03:30:29.075]  The New York Times.
[03:30:29.075 --> 03:30:32.157]  Iraq War Ends.
[03:30:32.157 --> 03:30:37.681]  And they've got, again, all these other fake headlines there.
[03:30:37.681 --> 03:30:39.682]  Let's read some of them here.
[03:30:39.682 --> 03:30:42.965]  It says, Nation sets its sights on
[03:30:46.878 --> 03:30:56.740]  It's so small I can't read all of it in the screenshot of it but... Ex-Secretary apologizes for WMD scare.
[03:31:12.594 --> 03:31:14.215]  So it goes on and on.
[03:31:14.215 --> 03:31:17.877]  This is obviously from a liberal bent, which you're not going to get from Barack Obama.
[03:31:17.877 --> 03:31:20.719]  You're going to get more wars, more corporate looting.
[03:31:20.719 --> 03:31:23.761]  He's saying he's now going to have lobbyists in his administration.
[03:31:23.761 --> 03:31:26.563]  He's saying that torture is going to continue.
[03:31:26.563 --> 03:31:29.344]  He's saying Guantanamo is going to stay open for now.
[03:31:29.344 --> 03:31:33.367]  The troops are going to stay there for 18 months before he looks at it again.
[03:31:33.367 --> 03:31:36.329]  He's saying wiretapping will continue.
[03:31:36.329 --> 03:31:37.970]  In fact, it's all over the news here today.
[03:31:39.696 --> 03:31:43.958]  Obama's bailout bunch brings us more of the same.
[03:31:43.958 --> 03:31:49.140]  That's out of Bloomberg Financial today.
[03:31:49.140 --> 03:31:52.982]  And that's exactly what he's doing.
[03:31:52.982 --> 03:31:56.243]  Most in AP poll confident Obama will fix economy.
[03:31:56.243 --> 03:31:58.964]  But I went and looked up the actual poll, not just the AP article.
[03:31:58.964 --> 03:32:01.405]  I went and looked it up by the folks that did it.
[03:32:01.405 --> 03:32:05.007]  They only asked registered Republicans and Democrats who had voted in the election.
[03:32:06.676 --> 03:32:09.458]  And so, you know, that's 30-40% of the public.
[03:32:09.458 --> 03:32:11.340]  Well, almost 40% of the public that didn't vote.
[03:32:11.340 --> 03:32:13.161]  They didn't ask them.
[03:32:13.161 --> 03:32:18.206]  But 70% believe Obama will try to fix the economy.
[03:32:18.206 --> 03:32:20.167]  I mean, that's just ridiculous.
[03:32:20.167 --> 03:32:25.472]  Now, if you research into this more, the majority of the public think the economy is going to get worse.
[03:32:27.753 --> 03:32:28.694]  That's the thing with polls.
[03:32:28.694 --> 03:32:32.060]  You've got to look at them from different angles.
[03:32:32.060 --> 03:32:34.485]  Here's an inter-press service report.
[03:32:34.485 --> 03:32:35.727]  Obama's foreign policy.
[03:32:35.727 --> 03:32:38.833]  No sharp break from Bush.
[03:32:38.833 --> 03:32:40.235]  As more companies seek aid.
[03:32:41.755 --> 03:32:43.136]  Where do the bailouts stop?
[03:32:43.136 --> 03:32:44.917]  Well, we haven't had real bailouts of U.S.
[03:32:44.917 --> 03:32:48.638]  companies or actual manufacturing or people's mortgages.
[03:32:48.638 --> 03:32:49.819]  And I'm against it.
[03:32:49.819 --> 03:32:51.580]  By the way, it's socialism.
[03:32:51.580 --> 03:32:52.680]  This isn't even socialism.
[03:32:52.680 --> 03:32:56.582]  This is just foreign banks looting us of over $2 trillion.
[03:32:56.582 --> 03:33:04.466]  But I'm going to shut up about that and go to Larry Pratt for just one segment because we've had record gun sales in the country.
[03:33:06.099 --> 03:33:10.983]  Breaking all of the instant background check records the FBI says.
[03:33:10.983 --> 03:33:14.785]  Gun shops everywhere are almost sold out or sold out.
[03:33:14.785 --> 03:33:20.189]  Most types of semi-autos that Obama wants to go after are there.
[03:33:20.189 --> 03:33:25.633]  But I thought we'd get Larry Pratt on just briefly to talk about what the real threat is and how they're going to do this by stealth.
[03:33:28.573 --> 03:33:33.842]  Where Barack Obama and his Chief of Staff really do stand on the Second Amendment.
[03:33:33.842 --> 03:33:38.189]  He wants a 500% tax on firearms.
[03:33:38.189 --> 03:33:40.994]  So if a gun costs $100, they would add $500 on it.
[03:33:43.308 --> 03:33:47.830]  They want to ban .50 cals, they want to restrict .308, .223.
[03:33:47.830 --> 03:33:50.632]  So they've said that they want to shut down gun shows.
[03:33:50.632 --> 03:33:56.054]  They are coming for your guns, but they've got to stage a mass shooting first or hype one up.
[03:33:56.054 --> 03:34:00.136]  Larry Pratt, head of Gun Owners of America, thanks for coming on with us.
[03:34:00.136 --> 03:34:01.757]  Alex, thank you for having me.
[03:34:01.757 --> 03:34:03.958]  I think you're absolutely correct.
[03:34:03.958 --> 03:34:12.803]  In many ways, I would imagine Obama being a Marxist thug right out of Chicago politics.
[03:34:13.584 --> 03:34:16.045]  Not to mention his Kenya connections.
[03:34:16.045 --> 03:34:17.046]  He's going to go for it.
[03:34:17.046 --> 03:34:19.887]  He's going to go for a lot of different things.
[03:34:19.887 --> 03:34:23.069]  Not speaking of guns at the moment.
[03:34:23.069 --> 03:34:29.092]  Especially I would imagine he's going to go after changing further the voting rules to further
[03:34:29.699 --> 03:34:32.641]  Keep his group of Marxists in power.
[03:34:32.641 --> 03:34:44.308]  Now again, the bankers put him in because the bankers, as Carol Quigley and others said, they like Marxists because they'll destroy the middle class, the competition of the elite, and hand all that money and power and real estate over to them.
[03:34:44.308 --> 03:34:47.030]  And so if you really look at what he's doing, he's coming after the middle class.
[03:34:47.030 --> 03:34:49.851]  His carbon tax will destroy the middle class.
[03:34:49.851 --> 03:34:56.976]  That'll produce poverty and unhappiness, and by changing the voting rules, they will be able to contain
[03:34:57.674 --> 03:35:03.798]  Any voting uprising that might occur, people standing in line all day for a loaf of bread.
[03:35:03.798 --> 03:35:07.540]  All we have to do is look at the Soviet Union, Cuba, other places.
[03:35:07.540 --> 03:35:10.642]  They don't have time to plan an election campaign or anything else.
[03:35:10.642 --> 03:35:14.924]  Yeah, I know you're a student of... I mean, you're a best-selling author and a student of history.
[03:35:14.924 --> 03:35:19.107]  Explain to people that communists aren't stupid.
[03:35:19.107 --> 03:35:20.888]  They always want to steal the wealth.
[03:35:20.888 --> 03:35:23.990]  They know that making you poor is a way to control you.
[03:35:23.990 --> 03:35:24.490]  Tell them about it.
[03:35:25.460 --> 03:35:31.744]  This has been a pattern that we have seen, and I've had to conclude they really do know what they're doing.
[03:35:31.744 --> 03:35:33.626]  It is a control technique.
[03:35:33.626 --> 03:35:37.248]  Communism, socialism, is not an economic theory.
[03:35:37.248 --> 03:35:43.672]  It's a political theory on how to rule, on how to maintain a monopoly of power.
[03:35:43.672 --> 03:35:50.397]  Now, obviously, guns being controlled by the government is part of it, but frankly, I think they're going to have us on our knees before they
[03:35:50.836 --> 03:35:54.417]  Do something bold like even renewing the Clinton gun ban.
[03:35:54.417 --> 03:35:54.877]  Exactly.
[03:35:54.877 --> 03:35:58.417]  They're not going to try to bring in troops to the streets.
[03:35:58.417 --> 03:36:06.299]  They're all set up and locked and loaded until the economic system causes riots and degradation and then the public will beg for it.
[03:36:06.299 --> 03:36:07.199]  Will applaud.
[03:36:07.199 --> 03:36:08.459]  Exactly correct.
[03:36:08.459 --> 03:36:13.220]  I think that's exactly the scenario that they would seek.
[03:36:13.220 --> 03:36:17.821]  And all we have to do is look either in rules for radicals to see what
[03:36:18.625 --> 03:36:37.001]  His communist mentor, not a live mentor, but he read him, Saul Alinsky and Rules for Radicals, or look at the way he collaborated with the takeover in Kenya, a power-sharing arrangement that had no constitutional basis, but the
[03:36:37.904 --> 03:36:44.409]  Victor in the election felt it was the only thing he could do to stop the mayhem, the killing of Christians in Kenya.
[03:36:44.409 --> 03:36:54.338]  And it turns out that Obama advised Odinga, and that's been documented in the emails, even mainstream news, on how to stage riots and kill people.
[03:36:54.338 --> 03:36:58.341]  So, I mean, this guy isn't playing games.
[03:36:58.341 --> 03:36:59.702]  No, he's not playing games.
[03:36:59.702 --> 03:37:06.488]  And he's going to have the youth corps, the million man spy army, which is now admitted back in the... I mean, we're talking about hellish.
[03:37:07.108 --> 03:37:18.355]  So look for something to go through before his first two years that says that for a federal election you have to allow for election day registration.
[03:37:18.355 --> 03:37:32.904]  Of course, amnesty will produce a lot of new Democrat voters, and they might even go so far as to bring statehood for Puerto Rico and D.C., which means four new socialist senators right there.
[03:37:32.904 --> 03:37:35.205]  That gives them closer and closer to a
[03:37:37.122 --> 03:37:39.844]  A defeat-proof majority.
[03:37:39.844 --> 03:37:49.692]  It may be that a majority of the country will be opposed to them, but you won't be able to register that effectively in an acorn-driven election with all the new rules.
[03:37:49.692 --> 03:38:04.845]  And so then gun owners can... We're going to be faced, very likely, with the prospect of the rules being changed, the BATFE, the Federal Gun Police, marching even worse than they are now under Bush.
[03:38:05.370 --> 03:38:06.050]  We're good to go.
[03:38:25.485 --> 03:38:28.906]  They could get that through about any time they wanted.
[03:38:28.906 --> 03:38:31.747]  And that's what they want to stop is private sales.
[03:38:31.747 --> 03:38:36.368]  And the way they write these is a citizen won't be able to even sell one to his neighbor.
[03:38:36.368 --> 03:38:44.530]  That gives the BATF an end to go after their favorite target, the law-abiding citizen who wants it for self-defense.
[03:38:44.530 --> 03:38:47.451]  That's who they love to throw the book at, not the real criminals.
[03:38:47.451 --> 03:38:52.732]  And so then they can really start going after people, seizing whole gun collections to quote
[03:38:53.212 --> 03:39:00.194]  And we know it's not going to bother criminals.
[03:39:00.194 --> 03:39:12.839]  They've got this and more in England, and all they've gotten for their trouble is almost now three times the number of illegal guns in the country as were there when they confiscated them at the beginning of 1997.
[03:39:12.839 --> 03:39:14.439]  So we are looking at a really bad ride
[03:39:20.331 --> 03:39:25.274]  And I think this guy is dedicated enough to power.
[03:39:25.274 --> 03:39:34.298]  He's no Bill Clinton who at least had the quote-unquote redeeming virtue of having, shall we say, extracurricular interest.
[03:39:34.298 --> 03:39:35.739]  This guy's all business.
[03:39:35.739 --> 03:39:39.661]  He is a hard, core, hate-filled Marxist.
[03:39:42.916 --> 03:39:55.383]  And his wife and he have said that he is focused, he wants to destroy the middle class, he loves the internationalists, he loves the bankers, he hates this country.
[03:39:55.383 --> 03:39:57.244]  There's no doubt about that.
[03:39:57.244 --> 03:40:02.387]  These internationalists, they hate the free market and they can't wait.
[03:40:02.387 --> 03:40:09.532]  They say it on NPR, the spoiled, rotten consumers, the Americans, the carbon tax will teach you.
[03:40:11.016 --> 03:40:12.258]  That's exactly right.
[03:40:12.258 --> 03:40:21.067]  I mean, the misery it's going to cause poor folks to bankrupt the coal plants and tax everything that's energy related to carbon.
[03:40:21.067 --> 03:40:21.988]  I mean, this is hellish.
[03:40:21.988 --> 03:40:23.950]  Go ahead, Larry.
[03:40:23.950 --> 03:40:30.357]  To them, it doesn't matter that they will kill the productive engine of the United States and probably the West.
[03:40:32.248 --> 03:40:33.309]  Hans Bricks?
[03:40:33.309 --> 03:40:33.489]  Oh, no!
[03:40:56.594 --> 03:40:57.255]  Oh, hello!
[03:40:57.255 --> 03:41:00.017]  Great to see you again, Hans!
[03:41:00.017 --> 03:41:06.683]  Mr. Eel, I was supposed to be allowed to inspect your palace today, and your guards won't let me into certain areas.
[03:41:06.683 --> 03:41:07.984]  Hans, Hans, Hans!
[03:41:07.984 --> 03:41:10.146]  We've been through this a dozen times!
[03:41:10.146 --> 03:41:13.329]  I don't have any weapons to match destruction!
[03:41:13.329 --> 03:41:14.710]  All right, all right, all right.
[03:41:14.710 --> 03:41:15.671]  Okay, Hans!
[03:41:15.671 --> 03:41:16.892]  Hey, how do you like them?
[03:41:17.625 --> 03:41:19.826]  I'm sorry, just a little bit of joking here.
[03:41:19.826 --> 03:41:21.066]  I meant to play that earlier.
[03:41:21.066 --> 03:41:28.968]  I'm not sad he's had a second stroke and that piece of filth who's murdered millions of his own people is probably going to die soon.
[03:41:28.968 --> 03:41:30.209]  Sorry, Larry, go ahead.
[03:41:30.209 --> 03:41:33.650]  Well, it hasn't stopped him, even though he's destroyed the middle class.
[03:41:33.650 --> 03:41:35.210]  They hardly produced anything.
[03:41:35.723 --> 03:41:46.067]  In North Korea, he lives perfectly luxuriously, or has, at least in the past, until his present illness, and that's the way socialists think.
[03:41:46.067 --> 03:41:49.189]  They look at economics as distribution.
[03:41:49.189 --> 03:42:01.594]  To the extent they believe their own propaganda, they look kind of like Michelle Obama, saying, well, we've got to take a piece of your pie and give it to somebody else who needs it more.
[03:42:02.906 --> 03:42:17.636]  It never occurs to them that the pie is going to be gone and there won't be anything to distribute, but they don't care because they will have attained power, total control for a very long period of time in so doing.
[03:42:17.636 --> 03:42:23.000]  And of course they're going to come after the guns, but they're going to come after the guns someday when we're standing in line.
[03:42:23.000 --> 03:42:25.462]  I was talking to a guy from Bolivia.
[03:42:25.462 --> 03:42:27.023]  They're having terrible times down there.
[03:42:27.023 --> 03:42:30.446]  They have to get in line about one in the morning if they want a loaf of bread later in the day.
[03:42:34.022 --> 03:42:40.745]  Well, that's what these control freaks do, Larry Pratt, as you know, over and over again.
[03:42:40.745 --> 03:42:43.827]  I mean, that's like UNIDIR said on July 7, 2000.
[03:42:43.827 --> 03:42:48.569]  They said we must disarm the civilians to have the power monopoly of the state.
[03:42:48.569 --> 03:43:01.356]  To them, they understand that independent people that are middle class are the enemy, and it's the lower classes dumbed down, working for socialism, that give the power structure to the elite to destroy the middle class.
[03:43:01.356 --> 03:43:02.917]  Again, this is so central.
[03:43:02.917 --> 03:43:03.577]  Please continue.
[03:43:04.645 --> 03:43:12.228]  So, you know, if we're standing in line waiting for a loaf of bread since 1, 2 o'clock in the morning, they can come by our house and collect the guns.
[03:43:12.228 --> 03:43:14.429]  We won't even be there!
[03:43:14.429 --> 03:43:17.751]  That's, metaphorically or figuratively, that's how it's going to be.
[03:43:17.751 --> 03:43:22.433]  Yeah, you won't even have a house to be able to buy guns or shoot them or have a culture.
[03:43:22.433 --> 03:43:23.533]  I have to accept the point.
[03:43:23.533 --> 03:43:24.814]  You're right.
[03:43:24.814 --> 03:43:27.395]  There will be, and it may not happen right away.
[03:43:27.395 --> 03:43:28.776]  You can look at South Africa.
[03:43:28.776 --> 03:43:29.496]  It's been happening
[03:43:30.069 --> 03:43:36.106]  Uh, little by little, but very steadily, for a number of years since the Communists took over the African National Congress.
[03:43:36.919 --> 03:43:38.300]  That's what's coming.
[03:43:38.300 --> 03:43:49.884]  And by the way, they allow selective gangs in South Africa and other countries to kill and murder other African tribes, groups of whites, whites killing other whites, and it's left alone.
[03:43:49.884 --> 03:44:02.129]  I've seen two different videos, and I'm not in a bashing fest here, folks, but if a gay guy got punched in the face and had something taken away and stomped, say a rainbow flag, it'd be international top news.
[03:44:02.129 --> 03:44:04.310]  In California, a group of
[03:44:05.834 --> 03:44:08.915]  Both sides were probably saying hateful things, I'm sure.
[03:44:30.379 --> 03:44:30.919]  No, they weren't.
[03:44:30.919 --> 03:44:37.082]  But the point is, is that they're going to allow selective thuggism.
[03:44:37.082 --> 03:44:38.183]  Exactly.
[03:44:38.183 --> 03:44:38.703]  Exactly.
[03:44:38.703 --> 03:44:44.846]  And they will actually blame the victim by saying it was the church that was speaking hateful stuff.
[03:44:44.846 --> 03:44:48.388]  And so that's why those poor homosexuals were provoked to do what they did.
[03:44:48.388 --> 03:44:54.471]  That's the world we're rapidly becoming part of.
[03:44:54.471 --> 03:44:58.233]  I mean, we've been dealing with a media that was skewered for some time.
[03:44:58.906 --> 03:45:07.619]  Uh, they try to make it seem as if we're in the middle of a big crime wave when we are not, but that's the way they can always sell gun control, like you say, every time there's a...
[03:45:08.500 --> 03:45:13.664]  A big shooting, that's the next opportunity for grabbing some more guns.
[03:45:13.664 --> 03:45:21.709]  Well Larry Pratt, the silver lining here that I want you to speak to in closing is that 10 years ago, 20 years ago, we were in trouble, they were advancing.
[03:45:21.709 --> 03:45:33.236]  Now they're advancing covertly with manufacturing lawsuits, importation restrictions, buying up all the ammo, but they're not advancing overtly anymore.
[03:45:34.617 --> 03:45:37.859]  And that's why Handgun Control and others have said, well, we'll just brainwash your kids.
[03:45:37.859 --> 03:45:38.279]  They brag.
[03:45:38.279 --> 03:45:39.340]  We've got your kids.
[03:45:39.340 --> 03:45:40.801]  I've seen them brag and say that.
[03:45:40.801 --> 03:45:48.866]  So the good news is these bastards are having to go more covert now because we're winning the fight for the hearts and minds.
[03:45:48.866 --> 03:45:50.207]  Well, I hope that's right.
[03:45:50.207 --> 03:45:55.551]  And if it is, we may find that we're going to have to switch to satellite radio.
[03:45:55.551 --> 03:45:58.052]  You're already there, of course.
[03:45:58.052 --> 03:46:02.115]  But these guys could even come after the Internet through a treaty with the U.N.
[03:46:02.560 --> 03:46:06.202]  There are so many stealth ways, we've only scratched the surface.
[03:46:06.202 --> 03:46:07.403]  Oh, I forgot to bring that up.
[03:46:07.403 --> 03:46:17.849]  Stay with us on the, speaking of the internet, we won't be on the AM and FM dial in the shortwave, but during this three minute break, just for the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and hundreds of thousands listening on the web,
[03:46:19.011 --> 03:46:26.977]  And on the podcast, explain how they may try a UN treaty to do that, Larry Pratt.
[03:46:26.977 --> 03:46:33.661]  But before we end this segment, give people the website and toll-free number to find out more.
[03:46:33.661 --> 03:46:37.384]  GunOwners is at gunowners.org on the web.
[03:46:37.384 --> 03:46:39.966]  That's the best way to get us, gunowners.org.
[03:46:39.966 --> 03:46:44.329]  You can join there, you can get on our email alert, which is a freebie, gunowners.org.
[03:46:45.523 --> 03:46:54.366]  And you've also got the Bitter Clinger t-shirt, which we'll talk about behind the scenes right now for theprisonplanet.tv viewers.
[03:46:54.366 --> 03:47:02.509]  Please stay with us, and then I'll be back in the final segment for everybody else.
[03:47:02.509 --> 03:47:06.650]  Okay Larry, get into the UN angle for folks.
[03:47:06.650 --> 03:47:12.132]  Well, for years they've been trying to get the United States looped into a treaty
[03:47:12.914 --> 03:47:18.118]  At the U.N., a small arms treaty is normally the way they call it.
[03:47:18.118 --> 03:47:22.461]  Well, small arms might sound military, and hey, I don't have a military gun.
[03:47:22.461 --> 03:47:26.945]  I just have a semi-automatic handgun or hunting rifle.
[03:47:26.945 --> 03:47:32.709]  Well, believe me, that's what they mean by small arms, and that's the way they could come against us.
[03:47:32.709 --> 03:47:35.551]  They've got this very, very wrong
[03:47:36.087 --> 03:47:40.209]  Notion that a treaty trumps anything in the Constitution.
[03:47:40.209 --> 03:47:43.350]  Actually, it only trumps something that the U.S.
[03:47:43.350 --> 03:47:47.272]  government had authority to enter into a treaty for to begin with.
[03:47:47.272 --> 03:47:49.753]  But they'll look at it as, oh, we got the treaty.
[03:47:49.753 --> 03:47:52.094]  Well, now we have to kiss off the Second Amendment.
[03:47:52.094 --> 03:47:53.074]  Sorry about that.
[03:47:53.074 --> 03:47:54.975]  Sorry about that D.C.
[03:47:54.975 --> 03:47:56.996]  decision that overturned gun ban.
[03:47:56.996 --> 03:47:57.796]  That was then.
[03:47:57.796 --> 03:47:58.796]  This is now.
[03:47:58.796 --> 03:48:00.417]  No more Second Amendment.
[03:48:00.417 --> 03:48:04.999]  And this is the way they've been advancing a lot of their agenda.
[03:48:05.490 --> 03:48:09.411]  For almost a hundred years, they started it with migratory birds.
[03:48:09.411 --> 03:48:14.232]  Oh, we can't keep you from hunting migratory birds with the national law?
[03:48:14.232 --> 03:48:17.333]  Okay, we'll get a treaty with Canada and then we'll stuff it right down your throat.
[03:48:17.333 --> 03:48:30.537]  Or they are now going to list carbon dioxide as a deadly toxic poison, not one of the four main elements of life on the planet, and by claiming polar bears are endangered, which they're at record levels, forty-something thousand just in
[03:48:32.142 --> 03:48:35.843]  Yeah, I guess I must have been dreaming when I saw those videos of polar bears in the Arctic swimming.
[03:48:54.973 --> 03:48:57.014]  No, it's all lies.
[03:48:57.014 --> 03:49:01.377]  And it's no longer global warming, it's now climate change.
[03:49:01.377 --> 03:49:08.703]  Any season, any climate change, the bureaucrats gotta take your house and your factory and your farm, because they care about you.
[03:49:08.703 --> 03:49:12.826]  And if they're doing it for a UN treaty, you really won't have any defense.
[03:49:12.826 --> 03:49:15.868]  Forget about any of your constitutional protections.
[03:49:15.868 --> 03:49:20.472]  Once they think they've got themselves covered with one of these UN treaties, that's it, baby.
[03:49:21.482 --> 03:49:25.705]  And they've been using these things for a long time.
[03:49:25.705 --> 03:49:29.847]  It's simply a matter of moving the chess pieces a little further down the board.
[03:49:29.847 --> 03:49:35.350]  It's not as if they're inventing something brand new.
[03:49:35.350 --> 03:49:43.095]  How do we stop the UN pushing through a treaty just being watchful?
[03:49:43.095 --> 03:49:49.018]  We've got to be watchful, and that's one reason I hope people will go to gunowners.org, get themselves on our email list,
[03:49:49.600 --> 03:49:55.905]  Alertless, because we may have to respond very, very quickly when they try to pull one of these things.
[03:49:55.905 --> 03:50:01.450]  It may come up in any number of backhanded ways from behind closed doors.
[03:50:01.450 --> 03:50:03.591]  And so, we've got to be ever alert.
[03:50:03.591 --> 03:50:09.756]  Folks have to be ready, kind of like Minutemen, to get those emails, or this thing could just pass.
[03:50:09.756 --> 03:50:10.337]  Absolutely.
[03:50:10.337 --> 03:50:11.798]  Larry, we're coming back to the full audience.
[03:50:11.798 --> 03:50:14.780]  Here we go.
[03:50:14.780 --> 03:50:17.703]  I'm going to let Larry Pratt go here in about a minute and a half, because the show's almost over.
[03:50:19.430 --> 03:50:38.493]  Before we do that, Larry, at the state level, at the county level, at the federal regulatory level, what are some of the biggest hot spots right now, some of the most dangerous threats to the Second Amendment, briefly, and then some of the good spots, some of the places where we're reclaiming our basic human right to self-defense?
[03:50:38.493 --> 03:50:47.875]  I would say one of the most important things that we have to do in the area of reclaiming is to get what we would call Katrina laws, laws that prohibit the
[03:50:48.499 --> 03:50:58.943]  The confiscation of guns from people during an emergency, unless they're committing a crime, but if they're just walking down the street with a shotgun... Yeah, you can't have emergency decrees to take people's guns.
[03:50:58.943 --> 03:51:07.406]  And if they do it, and just making it illegal won't stop them, because you hardly ever hear of police officers being prosecuted.
[03:51:07.406 --> 03:51:17.770]  But if you do what was done at the federal level, thanks to Senator Vitter and then Representative Jindal, and if you do it at the state level, as they have done in Utah, you make it so that if
[03:51:18.365 --> 03:51:22.328]  Those guns are confiscated in spite of the law.
[03:51:22.328 --> 03:51:32.575]  The victim can bring a personal lawsuit, meaning that the police department or whatever does not pay for the guy's legal expenses.
[03:51:32.575 --> 03:51:39.820]  And if he loses and there's a monetary settlement against him, because these will be civil suits, he has to pay it out of his own pocket.
[03:51:40.185 --> 03:51:43.949]  There goes his home, there goes his savings, there goes his retirement.
[03:51:43.949 --> 03:51:54.700]  Yeah, we've got to punish people that violate the Bill of Rights and Constitution, and that also gives police, you know, a law to say no to their superiors, or to the governor, or somebody else if they try that.
[03:51:54.700 --> 03:51:56.883]  Larry Pratt, thank you for joining us.
[03:51:56.883 --> 03:51:58.404]  Thank you for having me, Alex.
[03:51:58.404 --> 03:51:59.726]  I forgot, one quick question.
[03:51:59.726 --> 03:52:01.668]  Is it encouraging to see record gun sales?
[03:52:02.987 --> 03:52:06.973]  Yes, I think it is, because I know it's bringing new people into the fold.
[03:52:06.973 --> 03:52:10.298]  I've had calls from people who say, well, I've never owned a gun, but...
[03:52:11.027 --> 03:52:12.768]  Well, you know, ladies typically.
[03:52:12.768 --> 03:52:14.028]  But what kind of gun should I have?
[03:52:14.028 --> 03:52:15.849]  It's a good cultural revolution.
[03:52:15.849 --> 03:52:18.910]  I mean, I know a lot of liberals buying guns.
[03:52:18.910 --> 03:52:23.612]  They are waking up and realizing and understanding it's a very special, precious thing.
[03:52:23.612 --> 03:52:24.992]  Larry, thanks for joining us.
[03:52:24.992 --> 03:52:26.193]  Thank you.
[03:52:26.193 --> 03:52:26.753]  You bet.
[03:52:26.753 --> 03:52:30.955]  There goes Larry Pratt, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:52:30.955 --> 03:52:32.355]  We're about to end this transmission.
[03:52:32.355 --> 03:52:33.716]  We had a bunch of big guests on.
[03:52:33.716 --> 03:52:38.618]  Of course, Gary Franchi about the protest against the Federal Reserve all over the country, Alan Watt and others.
[03:52:40.031 --> 03:52:41.671]  That's coming up at the very end of the show.
[03:52:41.671 --> 03:52:45.652]  I'm getting over my cold, so the radio show is getting back on track.
[03:52:45.652 --> 03:52:55.674]  Before we end the broadcast, I do want to encourage everybody to listen to me very carefully and to start being self-sufficient, not just with firearms, but with storable foods.
[03:52:55.674 --> 03:53:05.896]  And the place to do that with the best storable foods available for the price, freeze-dried and dehydrated, is efoodsdirect.com, the J. Michael Stevens Group, 800-409-5633, with all the craziness and the upheaval.
[03:53:09.457 --> 03:53:09.717]  I think?

[03:53:53.456 --> 03:53:56.197]  They don't just have these neat atmospheric water generators there.
[03:53:56.197 --> 03:53:58.117]  They have a lot of other products.
[03:53:58.117 --> 03:53:59.338]  Solar panels, you name it.
[03:53:59.338 --> 03:54:00.578]  But just check them out.

[03:54:05.639 --> 03:54:06.599]  They manufacture them.
[03:54:06.599 --> 03:54:07.179]  They've got them.
[03:54:07.179 --> 03:54:08.600]  They've got them in stock.
[03:54:08.600 --> 03:54:10.740]  A lot of these atmospheric water generators are sold out, folks.
[03:54:10.740 --> 03:54:11.540]  They have them.
[03:54:11.540 --> 03:54:12.881]  Ecolablue.com.
[03:54:12.881 --> 03:54:14.341]  We have one right here in the office.
[03:54:14.341 --> 03:54:15.241]  I'm drinking it right here.
[03:54:15.241 --> 03:54:16.622]  In fact, put me on TV here real fast.
[03:54:19.252 --> 03:54:22.094]  Good stuff.
