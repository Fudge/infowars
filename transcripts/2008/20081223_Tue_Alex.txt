[00:00:21.192 --> 00:00:28.600]  Hello my friends, it is the 23rd day of December 2008, here in the waning days of 2008.
[00:00:29.862 --> 00:00:38.652]  A year where we saw MSNBC and the New Yorker magazine report that Dick Cheney, according to White House sources, planned to stage terror attacks against U.S.
[00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:40.213]  ships the Strait of Hormuz using
[00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:41.782]  U.S.
[00:00:41.842 --> 00:00:54.567]  Navy SEALs dressed up like Iranians, but the plan was nixed by the Pentagon when Admiral Fox Fallon resigned, refusing to go along with killing his own sailors and Marines.
[00:00:56.248 --> 00:00:59.109]  This is the type of issues that we're dealing with here.
[00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:02.870]  Throughout history, governments have staged terror attacks.
[00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:09.253]  And in the next 30 minutes here at PrisonPlanet.tv, I'm going to break down the story of Building 7.
[00:01:11.567 --> 00:01:37.585]  I think later next week I'm going to do a full hour on this and really go through the majority of the clips because there are hundreds and we do have time constraints here but I saw a new clip up on PrisonPlanet.com last night and a story this morning by Paul Watson and it says
[00:01:39.594 --> 00:01:44.636]  New York Fire Department Lieutenant admitted plan to take down Building 7.
[00:01:49.058 --> 00:01:52.019]  Now he is on MSNBC and he is in the clip.
[00:02:00.951 --> 00:02:08.763]  Openly saying that Building 7 has been burning and it may fall on its own or we may take it down.
[00:02:08.963 --> 00:02:12.148]  Now there's no debating what we may take it down means.
[00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.773]  Now this alone could be, you know,
[00:02:16.952 --> 00:02:19.193]  Still something to investigate, something very suspicious.
[00:02:19.913 --> 00:02:23.955]  Never had a modern steel building fall the way Tower 1, 2, or 7 did.
[00:02:24.115 --> 00:02:32.798]  Tower 7 was the 47-story building, also owned by Silverstein, a second largest spook compound in the world outside of DC.
[00:02:34.378 --> 00:02:35.899]  And what happened there?
[00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.240]  What happened with this case?
[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.921]  Well, Silverstein went on
[00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:55.641]  A program called America Rebuilds and says that there had been such a loss of life and a damage that the fire department made the decision to pull the building and so they gave the order and watched the building come down.
[00:02:56.081 --> 00:02:58.083]  They pulled the building
[00:02:59.662 --> 00:03:02.103]  They gave the order to pull it and watch the building come down.
[00:03:02.484 --> 00:03:05.586]  Now, pull it is a demolition term for controlled demolition.
[00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:19.614]  And in the very same documentary on PBS, 2002, they cut to the next scene and show them blowing up the wreckage of Building 6 that was still standing even though one of the towers fell on it.
[00:03:21.115 --> 00:03:23.796]  And they go, getting ready, getting ready to pull Building 6!
[00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:54.297]  and they have a controlled demolition and also pull it with cranes the direction they want it to fall so it doesn't damage other structures now we have videos of firefighters and police saying get back get back to get ready to bring the building down uh... then we have eyewitnesses that we've gone firefighters emergency workers police officers that say they heard the countdown that they were told to get back from the building and then i remember going
[00:03:55.356 --> 00:04:18.303]  I've been on air all day that day, and I remember rushing up to the local pizza place, I've told the story many times, to get a pizza, take out, and flipping between channels during news, and hearing CBS Radio News, I believe now defunct, I never hear it anymore, and ABC Radio News, both reporting, Building 7, the Solomons Brothers building, they don't want it to damage other nearby buildings, so they may bring it down.
[00:04:19.488 --> 00:04:20.449]  They may bring it down.
[00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:25.872]  Because, see, the Feds had to put out their story to the police and firemen, hey, don't worry, we don't want to damage stuff, we're going to bring it down.
[00:04:26.232 --> 00:04:30.195]  The police and firemen didn't ask, well, it takes weeks or months to rig a building properly.
[00:04:31.716 --> 00:04:33.998]  How are you going to do that?
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:48.187]  Now, since then, it's come out that Fox, CNN, and BBC all reported, in the hour before, Building 7 fell at 5.30 in the afternoon, Eastern,
[00:04:51.550 --> 00:05:16.085]  that the building had fallen due to fires in its own footprint at freefall they got the exact script right and BBC simultaneously on both channels said the exact same thing so we said that's false scripting that's a live video one of them is on a rooftop one of the fellas is on the street and so I said somebody sent out
[00:05:18.621 --> 00:05:20.742]  A news feed that was planted by intelligence.
[00:05:20.802 --> 00:05:25.083]  We know intelligence fills the BBC, fills Reuters, fills AP.
[00:05:26.024 --> 00:05:28.204]  That's been in congressional hearings back in the 70s.
[00:05:28.584 --> 00:05:30.645]  Somebody planted that story earlier.
[00:05:31.345 --> 00:05:38.188]  Kind of like stories were planted in the eastern press in Australia, New Zealand, Thailand that Lee Harvey Oswald
[00:05:40.341 --> 00:05:46.506]  had been caught and had killed Kennedy before he'd even been captured, his name released, you know, it was in newspapers.
[00:05:47.207 --> 00:05:50.630]  Clutcher Pratt, he always talked about that, one of the heads of black ops in the Pentagon.
[00:05:51.991 --> 00:06:04.962]  So here we had this and then people, the Pentagon debunkers came out and said we made it up that that was a tape, that that was a recording on the
[00:06:07.441 --> 00:06:11.824]  BBC and then later BBC said no that was real that was live we just made a mistake.
[00:06:13.025 --> 00:06:24.653]  So we have all of this and so today I wanted to go over some of the clips but first let's play about five minutes here at PrisonPlanet.tv from Terror Storm.
[00:06:25.634 --> 00:06:31.918]  It's a two plus hour film that I produced dealing with the history of government sponsored terror and we spend just a few minutes
[00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:33.451]  on Building 7.
[00:06:33.771 --> 00:06:35.112]  This is a small part of that.
[00:06:35.853 --> 00:06:41.519]  And then I want to go back through some of the other clips and the new clip and why this is such a big deal.
[00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:43.782]  So here's that clip.
[00:06:49.411 --> 00:06:49.912]  It's amazing.
[00:06:51.212 --> 00:06:53.293]  Amazing, incredible, pick your word.
[00:06:54.233 --> 00:07:05.078]  For the third time today, it's reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down.
[00:07:06.718 --> 00:07:13.041]  We have the owner of the World Trade Center complex admitting on tape that he ordered the building demolished on the afternoon of 9-11.
[00:07:13.101 --> 00:07:16.182]  I said, you know, we've had such terrible loss of life.
[00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.175]  Maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it.
[00:07:20.599 --> 00:07:22.143]  And they made that decision to pull.
[00:07:22.464 --> 00:07:24.910]  And then we watched the building collapse.
[00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:47.721]  During our on-the-ground investigations in New York City over the last five-plus years, we've talked to scores of eyewitnesses who had claimed that police and firemen told them to get back from Building 7 because it was going to be brought down or, quote, explode.
[00:07:48.345 --> 00:07:54.666]  Building 7, while I was listening to live feed from our local public radio station later in the afternoon, they talked about Building 7.
[00:07:55.306 --> 00:07:56.767]  Building 7 was fine.
[00:07:57.047 --> 00:07:58.427]  There was no airplane that hit it.
[00:07:58.747 --> 00:08:02.328]  And then they even began to ruminate on the air about demolishing the building.
[00:08:02.368 --> 00:08:03.588]  I said, well, I don't know.
[00:08:03.748 --> 00:08:05.929]  I mean, you can put out fires.
[00:08:06.429 --> 00:08:10.789]  Why would you talk about demolishing a building that wasn't hit by anything?
[00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:13.010]  The fires weren't bad or anything like that.
[00:08:13.644 --> 00:08:19.369]  I will say that I spoke to a cop on 9-11 who said that it was going to come down.
[00:08:19.649 --> 00:08:20.670]  I don't know how he knew that.
[00:08:21.451 --> 00:08:34.682]  Now, archived CNN footage has surfaced showing video footage of a New York City police officer telling cameramen and civilians to get back from Building 7 because the building was going to blow up.
[00:08:44.068 --> 00:08:59.557]  Just in the last few seconds another building, building number seven, one of the buildings in support of the World Trade Center towers has collapsed.
[00:09:15.453 --> 00:09:18.174]  This is no small building as you can see.
[00:09:18.194 --> 00:09:22.216]  At 47 stories, it would stand out in most American cities.
[00:09:27.378 --> 00:09:29.198]  And then, in late February of 2007,
[00:09:31.429 --> 00:09:48.944]  9-11 researchers reviewing archives of live news coverage from September 11th discovered to their shock that BBC World had reported that Building 7, also known as the Solomon Brothers Building, had completely collapsed over 20 minutes before its actual implosion.
[00:09:50.185 --> 00:09:52.888]  First anchors at the London News Desk reported it.
[00:09:54.011 --> 00:09:57.373]  Now more on the latest building collapse in New York.
[00:09:57.393 --> 00:10:01.836]  You might have heard a few moments ago I was talking about the Salomon Brothers building collapsing.
[00:10:02.276 --> 00:10:03.137]  And indeed it has.
[00:10:03.177 --> 00:10:13.784]  Apparently that's only a few hundred yards away from where the... They then cut to BBC reporter Jane Standley in New York who also reported that the Salomon Brothers building had fallen.
[00:10:14.304 --> 00:10:18.467]  All the while with the building clearly visible behind her through the window.
[00:10:18.487 --> 00:10:20.429]  Our correspondent, Jane Stanley.
[00:10:20.669 --> 00:10:24.432]  Jane, what more can you tell us about the Salomon Brothers building and its collapse?
[00:10:26.414 --> 00:10:28.475]  Well, only really what you already know.
[00:10:28.535 --> 00:10:30.197]  Details are very, very sketchy.
[00:10:30.217 --> 00:10:41.686]  There's almost a sense downtown in New York, behind me, down by the World Trade Centers, of just an area completely closed off as the rescue workers try to do their job.
[00:10:42.006 --> 00:10:45.829]  But this isn't the first building that has suffered as a result.
[00:10:45.889 --> 00:10:59.919]  We know that part of the Marriott Hotel next to the World Trade Center also collapsed as a result of this huge amount of falling debris from 110 floors of the two twin towers of the World Trade Center.
[00:11:00.359 --> 00:11:04.981]  As you can see behind me, the Trade Center appears to be still burning.
[00:11:05.021 --> 00:11:15.485]  We see these huge clouds of smoke and ash, and we know that behind that, there's an empty piece of what was a very familiar New York skyline.
[00:11:17.156 --> 00:11:24.317]  Another BBC News Channel, BBC 24, also got the word and reported the collapse 20 minutes before it fell.
[00:11:25.058 --> 00:11:27.818]  Enormous building in New York has collapsed.
[00:11:27.858 --> 00:11:36.860]  It is the 47-story Salomon Brothers building, which was situated very close to the World Trade Center, right there in this financial capital.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:45.862]  It then emerged that Aaron Brown of CNN reported, from a rooftop overlooking Ground Zero, that Building 7 had collapsed over an hour before it actually fell.
[00:11:46.912 --> 00:11:56.229]  We are getting information now that one of the other buildings, building 7 in the World Trade Center complex is on fire and has either collapsed or is collapsing.
[00:11:58.835 --> 00:12:18.146]  You, to be honest, can see these pictures a little bit more clearly than I, but building number seven, one of the buildings in this very large complex of buildings that is the Trade Center, there were, and that is the right way to put it, there were the two towers, but then there are a number of support buildings around it.
[00:12:18.766 --> 00:12:24.569]  And now we are told that there's a fire there and that building may collapse as well as you can see.
[00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:31.793]  We can see as we look now back downtown, we can see the billowing smoke.
[00:12:32.373 --> 00:12:40.798]  CNN and BBC's reports inclusively prove media prior knowledge and false start scripting of Building 7's controlled demolition.
[00:12:43.126 --> 00:12:51.589]  Couple that with hundreds of police, firefighters, and rescue workers stating that they were told to get back from Seven because it was going to be brought down.
[00:12:52.509 --> 00:12:57.611]  There can be no doubt that building Seven's destruction was an orchestrated inside job.
[00:12:57.631 --> 00:13:04.614]  9-11 was just one salvo in an ongoing war against the free peoples of the planet.
[00:13:04.954 --> 00:13:07.095]  It's all part of their terror storm.
[00:13:09.033 --> 00:13:12.477]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for joining us.
[00:13:12.517 --> 00:13:14.599]  So, that's a little bit of background.
[00:13:15.039 --> 00:13:24.709]  We have scores of police, firemen, EMTs, video clips, audio clips, with them saying, yeah, they said the building was rigged, that the feds were blowing it up.
[00:13:26.277 --> 00:13:35.822]  Let's go ahead first though and play Larry Silverstein on national TV saying they made the decision to pull it, gave the order, and watched it come down.
[00:13:36.102 --> 00:13:43.665]  Before I play you, the Deputy Fire Chief, this is a new clip, live from the day, MSNBC.
[00:13:44.185 --> 00:13:46.286]  That's right, but let's play Silverstein now.
[00:13:46.646 --> 00:13:47.167]  Here it is.
[00:13:47.187 --> 00:13:54.470]  I remember getting a call from the Fight Upon Commander telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[00:13:56.101 --> 00:13:58.043]  I said, you know, we've had such a terrible loss of life.
[00:13:58.063 --> 00:14:01.046]  Maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it.
[00:14:02.447 --> 00:14:06.771]  And they made that decision to pull, and then we watched the building collapse.
[00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:14.452]  Now, none of this even gets into the physical evidence.
[00:14:14.492 --> 00:14:25.035]  The bomb blast, the squibs, the building collapsing in on itself in a symmetrical implosion, the firefighters on multiple national TV shows saying they were inside the buildings.
[00:14:25.095 --> 00:14:27.955]  It was like molten steel was running.
[00:14:28.495 --> 00:14:29.556]  Only Thermate can do that.
[00:14:29.596 --> 00:14:34.537]  Let's go ahead and play that clip of New York Fire Department personnel saying it was molten steel.
[00:14:34.877 --> 00:14:35.877]  Then we'll get to the new clip.
[00:14:35.897 --> 00:14:36.337]  Here it is.
[00:14:37.697 --> 00:14:40.078]  Down below you see molten steel.
[00:14:41.634 --> 00:14:43.635]  Molten steel running down the channel rails.
[00:14:45.317 --> 00:14:46.417]  Like you're in a foundry.
[00:14:47.218 --> 00:14:53.261]  And we cut it quickly there because there's been some cussing.
[00:14:54.642 --> 00:14:59.065]  But again, those are senior fire department people telling you.
[00:15:00.346 --> 00:15:02.347]  Again, the temperatures from fires can't do that.
[00:15:04.232 --> 00:15:10.057]  Without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, and we have the name of this fire department commander.
[00:15:10.558 --> 00:15:11.258]  It's in a story.
[00:15:12.499 --> 00:15:17.424]  FDNY Lieutenant admitted plan to take down WTC-7.
[00:15:18.365 --> 00:15:19.786]  And this was on MSNBC.
[00:15:21.943 --> 00:15:25.184]  And his name, it's all on record.
[00:15:25.224 --> 00:15:30.005]  We've got all these other people, cops and firemen, some of them have been killed, some of them have died mysteriously.
[00:15:30.645 --> 00:15:33.005]  Now that they've spoken out, we hope nothing happens to him.
[00:15:33.385 --> 00:15:34.585]  He should go public quickly.
[00:15:35.125 --> 00:15:43.087]  Now that we've found this, and I'm telling you folks, I heard a bunch of other, I heard city officials and FEMA officials on the radio saying they were going to blow it up.
[00:15:44.487 --> 00:15:47.108]  Who's going to go get the ABC radio archives of that day?
[00:15:47.128 --> 00:15:47.888]  It's like 4 o'clock.
[00:15:49.568 --> 00:15:52.549]  Four o'clock central, like five o'clock eastern, thirty minutes before they blew it up.
[00:15:52.869 --> 00:15:54.369]  I'm at Mr. Gatti's getting a pizza.
[00:15:54.689 --> 00:15:55.449]  I'm flipping around.
[00:15:55.489 --> 00:15:56.790]  I'm waiting in the parking lot for the pizza.
[00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:00.650]  You know, I got there a little bit early and I'm listening to the radio.
[00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:02.711]  So I'm going to run home and do my own radio show.
[00:16:03.871 --> 00:16:04.631]  And I'm sitting there.
[00:16:05.471 --> 00:16:07.272]  And I'm hearing them talk about how they're blowing it up.
[00:16:07.392 --> 00:16:08.552]  And see, that's why I didn't even think about it.
[00:16:08.572 --> 00:16:09.972]  No way, they said they blew that up!
[00:16:10.473 --> 00:16:12.413]  Oh, shut up, conspiracy theorist!
[00:16:12.693 --> 00:16:14.413]  You didn't hear that on the radio.
[00:16:14.774 --> 00:16:15.914]  You didn't hear any of that.
[00:16:15.974 --> 00:16:16.574]  You understand?
[00:16:18.373 --> 00:16:19.560]  Let's go ahead and play this clip.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.043]  Here it is.
[00:16:20.506 --> 00:16:21.150]  Here's the new clip.
[00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:27.042]  In fact, you were just told by police that you should move out of your apartment, Fabiana.
[00:16:27.102 --> 00:16:28.083]  You've got Carolina here.
[00:16:28.143 --> 00:16:28.383]  Yes.
[00:16:29.504 --> 00:16:32.886]  They advised us to leave because you have... Oh my God.
[00:16:33.206 --> 00:16:33.766]  Look behind us.
[00:16:33.806 --> 00:16:34.607]  Please pan in this way.
[00:16:34.627 --> 00:16:35.627]  Please be careful of your baby.
[00:16:36.348 --> 00:16:37.068]  This is it.
[00:16:38.049 --> 00:16:38.769]  Oh my God.
[00:16:39.129 --> 00:16:39.650]  Oh my God.
[00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:40.350]  Oh my God.
[00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:40.750]  No.
[00:16:41.331 --> 00:16:41.491]  No.
[00:16:42.191 --> 00:16:42.451]  Listen.
[00:16:42.511 --> 00:16:43.692]  We'll be alright.
[00:16:43.712 --> 00:16:44.192]  We'll be alright.
[00:16:44.453 --> 00:16:45.133]  We're okay.
[00:16:45.353 --> 00:16:46.214]  I think we're okay.
[00:16:46.374 --> 00:16:47.374]  I think we're okay.
[00:16:49.215 --> 00:16:50.536]  All right, we're going to have to move this way.
[00:16:50.556 --> 00:16:51.116]  We're going to have to move.
[00:16:51.136 --> 00:16:51.756]  We're going to have to move.
[00:16:51.776 --> 00:16:53.216]  That cloud is coming this way.
[00:16:53.737 --> 00:16:54.637]  Ashley, get out of there.
[00:16:54.677 --> 00:16:59.959]  Leave the camera on, man, if you need to and get out of there.
[00:17:00.819 --> 00:17:03.560]  What we've been fearing all afternoon has apparently happened.
[00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:04.900]  We were watching No.
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.121]  7 World Trade, which was
[00:17:08.461 --> 00:17:10.782]  You know what, stop it there.
[00:17:11.183 --> 00:17:12.283]  I started this too late.
[00:17:12.303 --> 00:17:15.325]  We're going to come back from break and play it unedited here.
[00:17:15.705 --> 00:17:25.990]  Because then they go to the fire department lieutenant and he says, yeah, you know, they were talking about bringing it down, blowing it up, and now I guess that's happened.
[00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:28.571]  So again, this was on NPR.
[00:17:28.591 --> 00:17:29.892]  This was on CBS.
[00:17:29.912 --> 00:17:32.273]  This was on ABC.
[00:17:32.333 --> 00:17:34.854]  This was on MSNBC.
[00:17:34.874 --> 00:17:35.675]  That's Matt Lauer.
[00:17:37.346 --> 00:17:45.070]  And then we have, you know, we went and found the cops that are in the video on the ground with Amy Goodman when they're being told, get back, get back.
[00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:48.312]  Amy Goodman, Democracy Now!, she witnessed all of this.
[00:17:49.713 --> 00:17:52.575]  She's now been forced to admit that there should be an investigation of seven.
[00:17:53.735 --> 00:17:55.136]  I mean, this is incredible, folks.
[00:17:55.676 --> 00:17:56.197]  Stay with us.
[00:17:57.432 --> 00:18:02.736]  What will you do when the economy collapses, store shelves are empty, and your stored food is gone?
[00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:04.598]  How will you feed your family?
[00:18:04.758 --> 00:18:11.903]  True self-sufficiency and peace of mind is being able to grow a wide range of crops, ensuring a well-balanced diet for your family.

[00:18:27.295 --> 00:18:27.675]  I think so.
[00:19:04.126 --> 00:19:05.667]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:19:05.687 --> 00:19:07.268]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:19:07.368 --> 00:19:10.230]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:13.912]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:19:23.559 --> 00:19:28.489]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:19:29.511 --> 00:19:30.833]  An inside job.
[00:19:32.233 --> 00:19:33.293]  How dare you?
[00:19:34.854 --> 00:19:39.715]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:19:39.735 --> 00:19:42.536]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:19:42.636 --> 00:19:48.798]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rises.

[00:20:58.209 --> 00:21:03.331]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:21:04.031 --> 00:21:06.292]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:21:07.847 --> 00:21:09.588]  We do this with very heavy heart.
[00:21:10.468 --> 00:21:12.429]  You know, I know that 9-11 was an inside job.
[00:21:12.509 --> 00:21:18.512]  I know criminal elements in our government admittedly have staged over 200 declassified terrorist attacks.
[00:21:20.212 --> 00:21:27.496]  But it still shook me last night when I saw this newest clip of hundreds with a New York Fire Department commander.
[00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:32.875]  Talking about, and again, we're not saying they're complicit or involved, this is the official story they're giving.
[00:21:33.316 --> 00:21:36.199]  Oh yeah, it's endangering other buildings, we're going to have to bring it down.
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.944]  It may collapse on its own, we may have to blow it up.
[00:21:39.964 --> 00:21:41.946]  And that's what Silverstein also says.
[00:21:42.827 --> 00:21:44.990]  And then you have all the witnesses to that happening.
[00:21:45.879 --> 00:21:55.281]  And then you have the Deputy Head of Emergency Management talking about bombs going off in it before Tower 1 or 2 fell, and then he mysteriously dies quite quickly, Barry Jennings.
[00:21:56.701 --> 00:21:59.082]  So, I mean, this just gets more and more serious, folks.
[00:21:59.422 --> 00:22:08.944]  We have all these fire department people, all these police, on record, saying that there was a plan to blow it up, and no one asked, how was there a plan to blow it up?
[00:22:10.083 --> 00:22:11.105]  That takes weeks to do.
[00:22:11.806 --> 00:22:14.751]  And then now they say they never said that and we're conspiracy theorists.
[00:22:15.171 --> 00:22:16.774]  Folks, it is an inside job.
[00:22:16.834 --> 00:22:17.435]  It really happened.
[00:22:17.635 --> 00:22:19.619]  You think it's fun for me to confront these murderers?
[00:22:19.659 --> 00:22:20.760]  You think this is a fun job?
[00:22:21.281 --> 00:22:22.022]  I know who they are.
[00:22:23.524 --> 00:22:26.546]  You know, I have a lot of courage, but sometimes I wake up at 3 or 4 a.m.
[00:22:26.586 --> 00:22:29.307]  and it's not even fear, it's more of a shock.
[00:22:29.347 --> 00:22:31.508]  It's like, oh my God, I'm actually fighting these people.
[00:22:31.568 --> 00:22:36.190]  I'm actually on the air confronting people that would kill 3,000 people on 9-11.
[00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:38.071]  These bastards have to be defeated.
[00:22:38.131 --> 00:22:40.392]  My only fear is that we won't be effective.
[00:22:40.713 --> 00:22:41.713]  Now here's the clip.
[00:22:42.173 --> 00:22:42.994]  This is huge.
[00:22:43.474 --> 00:22:50.517]  This is Matt Lauer talking to one of the fire department commanders about the plan to bring down Building 7.
[00:22:50.577 --> 00:22:50.938]  Here it is.
[00:22:52.826 --> 00:22:57.473]  In fact, you were just told by police that you should move out of your apartment, Saviana.
[00:22:57.513 --> 00:22:58.815]  You've got Carolina here.
[00:22:59.916 --> 00:23:00.217]  Yes.
[00:23:00.297 --> 00:23:03.321]  They advised us to leave because you have... Oh my God.
[00:23:03.641 --> 00:23:04.182]  Look behind us.
[00:23:04.222 --> 00:23:05.023]  Please stand in this way.
[00:23:05.043 --> 00:23:06.025]  Please be careful of your baby.
[00:23:06.855 --> 00:23:07.456]  This is it.
[00:23:07.616 --> 00:23:09.178]  Oh my God.
[00:23:09.519 --> 00:23:10.079]  Oh my God.
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:10.940]  Oh my God.
[00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:11.161]  No.
[00:23:11.741 --> 00:23:11.902]  No.
[00:23:12.583 --> 00:23:12.883]  Listen.
[00:23:12.923 --> 00:23:14.125]  We'll be alright.
[00:23:14.145 --> 00:23:16.908]  We'll be alright.
[00:23:17.349 --> 00:23:20.973]  Alright, we're gonna have to move this way.
[00:23:20.993 --> 00:23:21.614]  We're gonna have to move.
[00:23:21.634 --> 00:23:22.195]  We're gonna have to move.
[00:23:22.215 --> 00:23:23.276]  That cloud is coming this way.
[00:23:24.157 --> 00:23:25.057]  Ashley, get out of there.
[00:23:25.097 --> 00:23:30.359]  Leave the camera on, man, if you need to, and get out of there.
[00:23:31.239 --> 00:23:34.000]  What we've been fearing all afternoon has apparently happened.
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:35.320]  We were watching No.
[00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:43.983]  7 World Trade, which was part of the ancillary damage of the explosion and collapse of the other two.
[00:23:44.063 --> 00:23:48.084]  We've been talking all day about how fast these plumes of smoke move.
[00:23:48.764 --> 00:23:53.009]  You're watching one on the move right now that is building dust.
[00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:59.156]  Look at the wider shot on the left from across the river in New York.
[00:24:01.139 --> 00:24:02.901]  This was a 40-story building.
[00:24:02.941 --> 00:24:04.402]  They've been watching all day.
[00:24:04.422 --> 00:24:08.187]  This is like watching the collapse of an active volcano.
[00:24:09.458 --> 00:24:13.862]  And the dust from it is not unlike that from a volcano.
[00:24:13.962 --> 00:24:19.668]  We are on the phone with New York Fire Department Lieutenant David Restuccio.
[00:24:19.988 --> 00:24:21.489]  Lieutenant, where are you right now?
[00:24:21.509 --> 00:24:25.813]  I'm at the corner of Northmore Street and Greenwich Street.
[00:24:25.973 --> 00:24:28.135]  Can you confirm it was number 7 that just went in?
[00:24:28.536 --> 00:24:29.637]  Yes, sir.
[00:24:29.817 --> 00:24:31.959]  And you guys knew this was coming all day?
[00:24:32.856 --> 00:24:41.499]  We had heard reports that the building was unstable and that eventually we need to come down on its own or it would be taken down.
[00:24:41.919 --> 00:24:52.403]  I would imagine it came down on its own and we are just awaiting now at our triage for any other casualties or any other injuries.
[00:24:52.483 --> 00:24:55.524]  Everybody alright where you are, Lieutenant?
[00:24:55.684 --> 00:24:56.745]  Very much so right now.
[00:24:57.697 --> 00:24:59.399]  Alright, back that up about 30 seconds.
[00:25:00.119 --> 00:25:00.700]  Did you hear?
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:05.143]  See, they put out the official story early in the day.
[00:25:05.864 --> 00:25:22.619]  Because Building 7, for some reason, was supposed to go out in the morning, but the plane from Pennsylvania, something happened, it didn't get hit by a plane, so they didn't have that big spectacular, but it was still wired, it was still a spook house, it was still ready to go.
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.181]  FBI, CIA, all in there.
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:31.362]  So for whatever reason, they then tell everybody all day, it's going to come down, it's going to come down.
[00:25:31.382 --> 00:25:34.504]  Before there are even fires in it, they're telling people, get out, it's going to come down.
[00:25:34.524 --> 00:25:35.445]  We'll be right back.
[00:25:35.485 --> 00:25:36.165]  Stay with us.
[00:25:39.507 --> 00:25:41.068]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:25:41.988 --> 00:25:44.329]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:25:44.349 --> 00:25:54.035]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:25:54.415 --> 00:25:56.076]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:25:57.048 --> 00:25:58.069]  But who is the enemy?
[00:25:58.589 --> 00:25:59.110]  Bin Laden.
[00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:00.391]  This is his M.O.
[00:26:00.411 --> 00:26:01.691]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:26:01.731 --> 00:26:03.413]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:26:03.753 --> 00:26:10.498]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:26:10.898 --> 00:26:11.339]  Some U.S.
[00:26:11.379 --> 00:26:17.043]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:26:17.723 --> 00:26:21.186]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:26:21.206 --> 00:26:23.387]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:26:49.961 --> 00:26:51.882]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:26:52.383 --> 00:26:55.284]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:01.789 --> 00:27:02.449]  Big Brother.
[00:27:03.089 --> 00:27:04.130]  Mainstream media.
[00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:05.971]  Government cover-ups.
[00:27:06.612 --> 00:27:07.432]  You want answers?
[00:27:08.213 --> 00:27:09.153]  Well, so does he.
[00:27:10.134 --> 00:27:13.436]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:13.936 --> 00:27:17.999]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27:19.218 --> 00:27:22.160]  We are live here at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:28.165]  We have a police detective, a survivor of 9-11 joining us.
[00:27:29.866 --> 00:27:37.993]  Coming up in the next segment, then later in the hour, Luke Rudowsky being harassed by FBI now for protesting the fact that 9-11 is an inside job.
[00:27:39.534 --> 00:27:40.975]  But what is the system going to do?
[00:27:41.135 --> 00:27:48.178]  There's hundreds of clips of firemen and police and fire commanders saying, yeah, they were going to blow the building up.
[00:27:48.198 --> 00:27:49.019]  They were going to bring it down.
[00:27:50.079 --> 00:27:53.981]  We were told it would fall on its own when it had no fires in it and then it got them.
[00:27:55.141 --> 00:27:56.782]  Or that we would bring it down.
[00:27:56.802 --> 00:27:58.783]  So that's in case it leaked, they were planting bombs.
[00:27:59.123 --> 00:28:00.084]  Oh yeah, we're bringing it down.
[00:28:02.253 --> 00:28:02.993]  Why did they do that?
[00:28:03.514 --> 00:28:03.914]  I don't know.
[00:28:03.954 --> 00:28:05.214]  The point is, they did blow it up.
[00:28:05.955 --> 00:28:07.615]  That shows foreknowledge and involvement.
[00:28:08.116 --> 00:28:09.156]  Let's play that clip.
[00:28:09.196 --> 00:28:10.037]  This is the new clip.
[00:28:10.077 --> 00:28:12.358]  And again, there's countless other ones out there.
[00:28:12.378 --> 00:28:13.818]  We just need you to dig them up and find them.
[00:28:14.018 --> 00:28:15.819]  Because I remember seeing them and hearing them that day.
[00:28:15.859 --> 00:28:16.940]  I didn't know what I was seeing, though.
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.461]  I'm like, they're going to blow up that building.
[00:28:19.481 --> 00:28:20.321]  That doesn't make sense.
[00:28:20.361 --> 00:28:25.324]  And then later they say it just fell on its own, and you kind of forget about it, focus on the big towers, and then
[00:28:26.244 --> 00:28:42.679]  It comes up, and all these disinfo operatives on the web, on every issue say we're a liar, say it isn't real, or say it isn't true, or say BBC didn't report the fall of seven before it fell, and then BBC admits they did, and then they come out and attack something new.
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:49.585]  To those government operatives, and I've seen them at Ground Zero, they'll walk right over, and you'll be like, you're a government agent aren't you?
[00:28:49.605 --> 00:28:50.106]  And they're just like,
[00:28:51.118 --> 00:28:54.882]  We're going to get you truthers, and you can tell some of these folks are probably involved in it.
[00:28:56.104 --> 00:28:58.346]  It is just truly, truly sick.
[00:28:58.987 --> 00:29:10.100]  As more and more evidence comes out, those that have been camp followers, or minions of this whole thing, they
[00:29:12.085 --> 00:29:17.408]  Are really going to look bad, you're really going to feel bad, because now you've made yourselves complicit in the murder of 3,000 people.
[00:29:17.748 --> 00:29:28.114]  Let's go ahead and finish up with the clip one more time with the fire lieutenant talking about how, yes, there was a plan to bring it down, building 7.
[00:29:29.014 --> 00:29:31.096]  That it was going to fall on its own or we were going to bring it down.
[00:29:31.116 --> 00:29:31.416]  Here it is.
[00:29:31.996 --> 00:29:34.637]  Northmore Street and Greenwich Street.
[00:29:34.798 --> 00:29:36.959]  Can you confirm it was number 7 that just went in?
[00:29:37.379 --> 00:29:37.779]  Yes, sir.
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.781]  And you guys knew this was coming all day?
[00:29:41.676 --> 00:29:50.340]  We had heard reports that the building was unstable and that eventually it would come down on its own or it would be taken down.
[00:29:50.761 --> 00:30:02.346]  I would imagine it came down on its own and we are just awaiting now at our triage for any other casualties or any other injuries.
[00:30:02.366 --> 00:30:03.247]  So there you have it.
[00:30:03.507 --> 00:30:10.731]  Again, confirmed by Silverstein, by firefighters, senior firefighters, by all these people that
[00:30:11.724 --> 00:30:15.045]  Building 7, there was a plan to bring it down.
[00:30:15.786 --> 00:30:17.146]  And what did Larry Silverstein say?
[00:30:17.166 --> 00:30:19.227]  Let's play that clip one more time.
[00:30:19.547 --> 00:30:25.489]  There had been such a great loss of life that we made the decision to pull it, and so we gave the order and watched it come down.
[00:30:25.569 --> 00:30:27.650]  Pull it, demolition term for controlled demolition.
[00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:30.691]  We gave the order to pull it, and then watched the building come down.
[00:30:31.431 --> 00:30:32.652]  I mean, what does that mean to you?
[00:30:32.972 --> 00:30:36.933]  And then you see the building with the blast points and the rest of it, and all of it happening.
[00:30:36.953 --> 00:30:37.314]  Here it is.
[00:30:37.334 --> 00:30:40.955]  I remember getting a call from the fight-upon-commander.
[00:30:41.787 --> 00:30:44.308]  Telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[00:30:44.328 --> 00:30:47.909]  I said, you know, we've had such terrible loss of life.
[00:30:48.969 --> 00:30:50.910]  Maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it.
[00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:53.871]  And they made that decision to pull.
[00:30:54.151 --> 00:30:56.552]  And then we watched the building collapse.
[00:31:00.379 --> 00:31:13.204]  So what happens is, as we get dozens and dozens and dozens of more clips every year of firefighters, police, you know, Amy Goodman down there on the ground hearing the countdown, and then suddenly the building falls.
[00:31:15.385 --> 00:31:18.787]  Again, we don't make a big enough deal about this.
[00:31:18.807 --> 00:31:23.288]  I mean, we know it's an inside job, so we don't go out and point out that the evidence just piles up.
[00:31:23.589 --> 00:31:24.489]  This is huge!
[00:31:25.489 --> 00:31:26.850]  And I demand a grand jury.
[00:31:27.876 --> 00:31:33.718]  In New York, New York State, somewhere else in the country, because people were lost from all over the U.S., all over the world.
[00:31:35.719 --> 00:31:46.882]  Call some of these people before them, before the feds, kill them, like this fire lieutenant, and say, okay, you know, exactly who told you they were planning to bring the building down?
[00:31:48.603 --> 00:31:50.923]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, we know it's an inside job.
[00:31:51.163 --> 00:31:53.304]  Here's the evidence in front of you.
[00:31:53.764 --> 00:31:55.265]  It just keeps stacking up.
[00:31:55.325 --> 00:31:55.825]  Stay with us.
[00:31:58.041 --> 00:32:00.608]  Toxic heavy metals negatively impact our health.
[00:32:00.849 --> 00:32:05.401]  They're in the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, the products we use, and the objects
[00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:07.450]  I think so.
[00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:35.900]  I think so.
[00:32:58.098 --> 00:33:00.640]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.241]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[00:33:02.521 --> 00:33:04.522]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:33:04.682 --> 00:33:06.443]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:33:06.583 --> 00:33:07.804]  The late, great USA.
[00:33:08.064 --> 00:33:09.485]  America, freedom to fascism.
[00:33:09.825 --> 00:33:16.669]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[00:33:57.837 --> 00:34:03.161]  With rising unemployment and an economy that continues to fail comes an increase in crime.
[00:34:03.602 --> 00:34:05.343]  Are you safe when you walk to your car?
[00:34:05.884 --> 00:34:07.365]  Are your kids safe when they go out?
[00:34:08.025 --> 00:34:11.628]  Everyone needs something to give that extra edge in case of an attack.
[00:34:12.029 --> 00:34:15.552]  You need DPS pepper spray from MrDefense.com.
[00:34:16.012 --> 00:34:21.897]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray on the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies
[00:34:25.469 --> 00:34:28.391]  The keychain is a great way to surprise a potential attacker.

[00:34:57.766 --> 00:35:03.390]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:35:10.315 --> 00:35:15.999]  He is a New Jersey police detective who responded on 9-11.
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.781]  So he's a 9-11 first responder.
[00:35:19.722 --> 00:35:24.465]  Detective John Carroll, I know he sent Richard Gage in to speak to police in
[00:35:26.204 --> 00:35:33.009]  The New Jersey New York area has a lot of courage and now he's becoming more vocal and I already had him set up for the show yesterday.
[00:35:34.602 --> 00:35:44.709]  But it dovetails perfectly into what I've been covering in the last 30 minutes here at PrisonPlanet.tv and of course on the radio show that we're simulcasting with right now.
[00:35:45.769 --> 00:35:54.075]  And that is that, I mean, firemen, police, I've got a bunch of other audio and video clips I'm going to play this hour, on record saying they heard the countdown.
[00:35:54.135 --> 00:36:00.880]  But not just them saying that to us now, we have CNN and MSNBC and others where they're saying, get back, get back, they're bringing it down.
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:03.942]  And then the feds, when they approach you at Ground Zero,
[00:36:04.912 --> 00:36:07.274]  They go, how dare you?
[00:36:07.314 --> 00:36:08.114]  These guys are wicked.
[00:36:08.714 --> 00:36:10.095]  They'll say, how dare you?
[00:36:10.436 --> 00:36:12.637]  They'll just be like looking at you with dagger eyes.
[00:36:13.037 --> 00:36:15.359]  How dare you say the cops and firemen blew it up?
[00:36:16.039 --> 00:36:17.160]  We go, we didn't say that.
[00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:19.201]  They were just given the official story.
[00:36:19.641 --> 00:36:22.083]  They were bringing it down for everybody's safety and then told to shut up.
[00:36:23.224 --> 00:36:24.104]  They're like, oh.
[00:36:24.164 --> 00:36:26.085]  And they'll tell the crowd, you hear him?
[00:36:26.526 --> 00:36:28.207]  They say the firemen did it.
[00:36:29.845 --> 00:36:55.661]  uh... again and and and then they'll look to see how the how the ops work and i mean these people are sick they are sick and uh... this was a giant false flag attack and there's all the evidence thousands of pieces but building seven not just the evidence uh... of of thermate and thermite and the explosions in the building falling at free fall and NIST now having to admit that
[00:36:57.808 --> 00:37:00.869]  It's that for some reason another plane didn't hit it.
[00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:06.671]  Something else developed.
[00:37:09.151 --> 00:37:09.852]  Something else.
[00:37:11.252 --> 00:37:13.653]  You know guys, when I go into these coughing fits, just put a screen up.
[00:37:13.673 --> 00:37:21.915]  Because I'm in here sick and I just put a screen up whenever you see me going to cough so we don't torture people with that on television or I may not be able to continue the show here.
[00:37:25.096 --> 00:37:25.636]  Yes we can.
[00:37:25.736 --> 00:37:25.997]  Alright.
[00:37:29.541 --> 00:37:34.746]  Again, I'm in here even though I've been sick the last few days because this information is too important, so just bear with me, folks.
[00:37:42.292 --> 00:37:44.834]  What you can do is just aim a camera at the wall and then cut to that.
[00:37:46.455 --> 00:37:46.936]  All right.
[00:37:50.359 --> 00:37:55.063]  Look, you know, I'm way past
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:06.442]  I'm way past even, and this isn't about radio, this isn't about my films, this isn't about anything with me.
[00:38:06.562 --> 00:38:13.864]  I mean, this, other than the fact that I'm in danger from fighting these murdering bastards, and everybody else is that fights them, but we're in greater danger of not standing up to them.
[00:38:16.464 --> 00:38:20.345]  And, this is real, folks!
[00:38:20.385 --> 00:38:26.407]  We're really fighting people that would attack their own country, and then pose as saviors on top of the smoking pile of rubble and dead.
[00:38:28.752 --> 00:38:32.554]  And we really do have a corrupt elite that is just completely out of control.
[00:38:35.275 --> 00:38:37.136]  And they really did stage the terror attacks.
[00:38:37.196 --> 00:38:41.298]  I mean, even if you don't want to believe it, they really do make big mistakes.
[00:38:41.838 --> 00:38:44.879]  And it was known to the police and firemen that they at least blew up Building 7.
[00:38:45.159 --> 00:38:47.741]  And it would take weeks or months to do that.
[00:38:48.201 --> 00:38:52.723]  And it was a spook house full of FBI, Defense Intelligence, CIA, you name it.
[00:38:54.624 --> 00:38:57.465]  And they are killing 9-11 first responders that are blowing the whistle.
[00:38:58.666 --> 00:39:00.467]  And they are going after We Are Change.
[00:39:00.808 --> 00:39:02.289]  And they do have FBI harassing them.
[00:39:02.569 --> 00:39:04.090]  And I do get death threats over this.
[00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:05.992]  And this is real, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:06.532 --> 00:39:07.253]  This is real.
[00:39:07.633 --> 00:39:14.899]  And you just heard a fire department commander on record saying that they'd been told that the Feds had a plan to bring down Building 7.
[00:39:15.099 --> 00:39:17.621]  To quote, protect other buildings.
[00:39:17.921 --> 00:39:18.642]  Which they did.
[00:39:18.702 --> 00:39:20.504]  It went down perfectly in its own footprint.
[00:39:21.314 --> 00:39:22.956]  So, enough said.
[00:39:23.857 --> 00:39:31.247]  Detective John Carroll, I appreciate you coming on the show with us today.
[00:39:31.307 --> 00:39:35.133]  First, I know you were listening earlier, give me your take on the latest.
[00:39:36.274 --> 00:39:42.556]  Mainstream live clip where police, firemen and others were said, we were told to get back, they were going to bring down 7.
[00:39:43.257 --> 00:39:44.737]  We were expecting this all day.
[00:39:45.037 --> 00:39:50.099]  Again, not saying fire and police are involved, but now after the fact, when they cover up, they become complicit.
[00:39:50.419 --> 00:39:52.220]  To some degree, you are not complicit.
[00:39:54.249 --> 00:39:59.010]  Because you're still the hero you were, fighting that day to help the people and fighting today to expose the truth.
[00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:03.871]  But God forbid our police and firemen do come complicit by playing along with this.
[00:40:03.951 --> 00:40:06.352]  So, Detective Carroll, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:40:07.152 --> 00:40:08.132]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[00:40:08.772 --> 00:40:09.132]  You bet!
[00:40:10.352 --> 00:40:10.872]  Absolutely.
[00:40:12.573 --> 00:40:16.834]  I think it's up to all law enforcement, military law enforcement.
[00:40:17.894 --> 00:40:19.454]  We swore to protect this country.
[00:40:20.114 --> 00:40:22.915]  This is what... and we're compensated for it.
[00:40:24.011 --> 00:40:26.192]  You know, I'm a Jersey City detective.
[00:40:27.092 --> 00:40:32.873]  On 9-11, I mean, we knew, I didn't know it was positive 7 at the time.
[00:40:33.413 --> 00:40:34.954]  We just heard a building was definitely coming down.
[00:40:35.654 --> 00:40:38.455]  We ran out, you know, we were just evacuated.
[00:40:38.935 --> 00:40:45.597]  But anybody that's not coming forward in law enforcement at this point is complicit after the fact.
[00:40:46.097 --> 00:40:46.657]  Would you agree with that?
[00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:48.631]  No, I agree with you.
[00:40:48.671 --> 00:41:00.243]  Anybody who's seen the facts and who is in denial, and I've had so many police come up and shake my hand or wave or thank me when I'm down at Ground Zero, but then most of them don't want to go on camera.
[00:41:00.303 --> 00:41:04.707]  Some do now wave at us and give us thumbs up, even commanders, but they won't go on tape.
[00:41:04.727 --> 00:41:10.873]  And then there's always black-op military stalking around in uniform giving us dirty looks, probably involved in the attacks.
[00:41:11.454 --> 00:41:13.655]  Well Alex, I'm a trained professional and I will protect myself and my family.
[00:41:32.921 --> 00:41:38.282]  So the average fireman, the average emergency worker, the average police officer, you just heard 07's coming down.
[00:41:38.823 --> 00:41:39.383]  No big deal.
[00:41:39.403 --> 00:41:39.983]  Three buildings.
[00:41:40.043 --> 00:41:41.423]  First time in history from fire.
[00:41:41.823 --> 00:41:42.524]  It's coming down.
[00:41:42.564 --> 00:41:43.044]  Get back.
[00:41:44.304 --> 00:41:46.685]  Well, again, I'm not a structural engineer.
[00:41:48.965 --> 00:41:56.187]  We weren't aware of the vernacular, but we were told, I would say, about an hour before.
[00:41:56.207 --> 00:42:02.109]  I think, again, I'm Jersey City, so our communications
[00:42:03.608 --> 00:42:05.369]  We're directly across the river.
[00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:10.594]  It was approximately an hour before that we were told to evacuate.
[00:42:15.578 --> 00:42:17.099]  And specifically, what did you hear?
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:20.402]  Just that a building was coming down.
[00:42:22.704 --> 00:42:27.628]  We were Jersey City personnel, so we were just told to evacuate.
[00:42:28.197 --> 00:42:48.187]  So on record they knew Building 7 was coming down and what is it like to hear all these or see all these video clips of police, firemen, emergency workers, all saying that they were told, you know, higher-ups, that the feds were going to bring down Building 7 and then in hindsight, because that proves inside job, to see it all being denied?
[00:42:49.488 --> 00:42:51.089]  Well, it's disheartening.
[00:42:51.869 --> 00:42:53.170]  But you have to put it in proper context.
[00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:54.831]  I mean, how do we move forward?
[00:42:54.851 --> 00:42:56.852]  And I think your show provides the
[00:42:58.564 --> 00:43:01.105]  You know, the apparatus to motivate us.
[00:43:01.686 --> 00:43:03.466]  And I think that's what we're doing.
[00:43:03.486 --> 00:43:07.048]  I think that's individuals like myself and a lot of cops are listening right now, too.
[00:43:07.969 --> 00:43:08.369]  Just so you know.
[00:43:09.810 --> 00:43:13.271]  Well, I want to just beg them to have the courage to stand up and speak out.
[00:43:13.711 --> 00:43:19.513]  An investigation in New York or New Jersey by people inside the system could literally bring down the New World Order.
[00:43:19.874 --> 00:43:26.976]  If it comes out that it's an inside job, mainline, they can't kill all of you, then this will bring down the New World Order.
[00:43:27.016 --> 00:43:28.277]  They cannot survive this.
[00:43:28.837 --> 00:43:36.139]  And I've risked my life and many others have been killed to bring you this information, so I hope to God you'll have the courage to at least investigate what we're saying.
[00:43:36.639 --> 00:43:37.820]  Now, specifically,
[00:43:41.698 --> 00:43:46.702]  In your own saga, trying to wake up your department, that's one of the reasons you're here today.
[00:43:46.742 --> 00:43:47.322]  Break that down.
[00:43:47.342 --> 00:43:48.383]  I mean, talk about whatever you want.
[00:43:51.024 --> 00:43:58.509]  Well, what I've attempted to do, and now I haven't done this formally, so I want to be specific with that and be clear with it.
[00:43:58.529 --> 00:44:06.595]  I haven't put it formally on paper, which I mean, that's how you establish a paper trail as far as making a formal request.
[00:44:08.839 --> 00:44:13.402]  I'm walking a fine line here because they could bring charges against me, so I have to be very careful what I say.
[00:44:14.803 --> 00:44:17.926]  First of all, we're Jersey City.
[00:44:18.606 --> 00:44:22.049]  It's a hotbed of Middle Eastern people.
[00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:26.833]  It's a microcosm of all types of people in Jersey City.
[00:44:27.573 --> 00:44:30.776]  We really are an ethnic bully abyss here.
[00:44:31.496 --> 00:44:37.721]  But we don't have a terrorist task force, which is odd to me.
[00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:51.181]  And when I try to, you know, I attempt to speak to people about the issue, my fellow officers reclure from it, and I have no idea why they do that.
[00:44:53.003 --> 00:45:01.632]  And that's why I wanted to ask you advice on how to present the information to them.
[00:45:03.171 --> 00:45:09.313]  Well, I mean, I don't have all the answers, but first off, I would understand that they're in fear.
[00:45:09.433 --> 00:45:10.573]  Deep down they know it's true.
[00:45:11.174 --> 00:45:11.954]  They're not stupid.
[00:45:12.674 --> 00:45:14.195]  And they want to hold on to their life.
[00:45:14.255 --> 00:45:17.796]  It's too scary to admit there's this big evil power running the government.
[00:45:18.556 --> 00:45:18.897]  I don't know.
[00:45:35.612 --> 00:45:38.794]  The NATO option, Operation Ajax, this is all admitted.
[00:45:39.075 --> 00:45:41.216]  Huge terror attacks staged.
[00:45:41.757 --> 00:45:45.199]  You can give them Northwoods, ABC News, plans to kill U.S.
[00:45:45.259 --> 00:45:47.301]  troops, plans to bomb U.S.
[00:45:47.341 --> 00:45:48.902]  cities and blame it on foreign enemies.
[00:45:49.523 --> 00:45:57.649]  And so, first that this has gone on, and then I would just show them the clips of going, okay, why did they report that Building 7 was going to be brought down?
[00:46:00.188 --> 00:46:07.130]  And then later say that it was just fire that did it, when no steel building had ever done this, and then here's Richard Gage's information.
[00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:09.130]  This needs to be looked into.
[00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:18.533]  And then I would give them the Keith Olbermann clip, talking about Dick Cheney wanting to stage terror attacks against our own ships, the Cy Hirsch report on that, and then say okay.
[00:46:18.813 --> 00:46:23.594]  And then I would also give them the polls, showing the majority of Americans believe that there's a 9-11 cover-up.
[00:46:24.634 --> 00:46:32.867]  I mean, Alex, I'm sorry not to interrupt you, but, I mean, as a police officer, you know, you reconcile your mortality pretty much on a daily basis.
[00:46:33.408 --> 00:46:37.073]  I don't think it's, I really don't think it's a fear for their safety.
[00:46:37.374 --> 00:46:39.156]  I just believe it's more of that with
[00:46:40.066 --> 00:46:41.807]  You know, an emotional fear.
[00:46:42.588 --> 00:46:43.388]  No, no, I agree.
[00:46:43.408 --> 00:46:44.169]  They've done studies.
[00:46:44.189 --> 00:46:44.469]  Stay there.
[00:46:44.489 --> 00:46:45.390]  We'll come back and talk about this.
[00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:48.252]  This is important, but I want to hear what you have to say, not just, you know, myself.
[00:46:49.193 --> 00:46:52.355]  It's easier to charge a machine gun, Ness, to go against your peers.
[00:46:52.795 --> 00:46:54.516]  They found that in psychological studies.
[00:46:54.636 --> 00:46:55.197]  We'll be right back.
[00:46:57.799 --> 00:47:09.507]  Now that the election is over and the shock is beginning to wear off, Ready Reserve Foods, in an effort to get as many Americans prepared for the promised changes of the new administration and to help you and your family survive the global economic crash,
[00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:19.547]  Ready Reserve food offers only the highest quality dehydrated food, packed in double enameled cans in an inert nitrogen atmosphere, allowing a 15 plus year shelf life.
[00:47:19.627 --> 00:47:21.969]  Ready Reserve has been manufacturing since 1972, giving
[00:47:43.541 --> 00:47:47.843]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:47:47.863 --> 00:47:52.304]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds,
[00:48:06.983 --> 00:48:08.064]  It makes me wonder if a U.S.
[00:48:08.104 --> 00:48:12.169]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:26.046]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:48:26.598 --> 00:48:31.901]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:48:32.201 --> 00:48:38.145]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[00:48:38.845 --> 00:48:40.646]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:48:41.707 --> 00:48:44.868]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[00:48:45.309 --> 00:48:45.909]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:48:45.949 --> 00:48:48.110]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[00:48:48.130 --> 00:48:48.190]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:48:56.431 --> 00:49:02.796]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:49:03.176 --> 00:49:05.158]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:49:05.839 --> 00:49:06.859]  But who is the enemy?
[00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:07.900]  Bin Laden.
[00:49:08.181 --> 00:49:09.101]  This is his ammo.
[00:49:09.121 --> 00:49:10.502]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:49:10.542 --> 00:49:12.184]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:49:12.544 --> 00:49:19.289]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:20.130]  Some U.S.
[00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:25.855]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:49:26.515 --> 00:49:29.997]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:49:30.397 --> 00:49:40.263]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:49:40.483 --> 00:49:41.223]  Fabled enemies.
[00:49:41.724 --> 00:49:49.008]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:49:49.468 --> 00:49:52.830]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[00:49:56.249 --> 00:49:59.271]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:49:59.711 --> 00:50:03.014]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:50:03.494 --> 00:50:09.438]  Solar powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[00:50:09.798 --> 00:50:13.941]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[00:50:14.441 --> 00:50:20.165]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[00:50:20.465 --> 00:50:23.467]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:50:26.229 --> 00:50:26.569]  I think so.
[00:50:59.193 --> 00:51:04.563]  Alright, Detective John Carroll from Jersey City, New Jersey is our guest.
[00:51:04.583 --> 00:51:10.193]  He was the first responder on the day of 9-11 and throughout the next few days working there on the pile.
[00:51:11.625 --> 00:51:15.366]  And a lot of his cohorts listening right now there in his department.
[00:51:16.026 --> 00:51:21.507]  Look, sir, I mean, you know more about being a police officer than I do and how to deal with it.
[00:51:22.107 --> 00:51:26.428]  I would just tell these officers, look at 8.5 trillion stolen in eight weeks and counting.
[00:51:27.188 --> 00:51:29.329]  The people that did this attack aren't going to stop.
[00:51:29.389 --> 00:51:32.690]  I mean, and now troops on the streets and all of that.
[00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:36.911]  I mean, we have been taken over by foreign corporate interests that are looting us.
[00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:42.901]  I mean, I guess they can just live in denial and they're going to lose everything they got.
[00:51:43.442 --> 00:51:46.003]  Because criminals that will do something this big aren't going to stop.
[00:51:46.343 --> 00:51:47.664]  But, I mean, go ahead and make your points.
[00:51:47.724 --> 00:51:50.585]  Make your points of your awakening and where you see all this going.
[00:51:52.146 --> 00:51:55.027]  Well, again, Alex, I'm not a professional orator.
[00:51:55.047 --> 00:52:00.930]  I mean, I find myself a fairly articulate person, but... Well, I'm not a professional orator either, but go ahead.
[00:52:01.891 --> 00:52:04.972]  Well, you sure come off like one.
[00:52:05.453 --> 00:52:07.994]  But I think at the end of the day,
[00:52:09.522 --> 00:52:19.847]  To try to inspire people to move forward in general, not just police officers, they need to assimilate to what the reality is.
[00:52:20.987 --> 00:52:28.030]  And I think it's just at such a core level that the 9-11 issue is just such a... it redefines your existence.
[00:52:28.570 --> 00:52:31.631]  And I think that's the wall that I'm bouncing against.
[00:52:32.372 --> 00:52:37.534]  Now, for some reason, I could see through it, but I think that
[00:52:38.348 --> 00:52:42.431]  Police are, you know, we're authoritative.
[00:52:43.712 --> 00:52:46.033]  You become that over and over.
[00:52:46.073 --> 00:52:50.556]  I mean, I was never that type of guy to begin with, excuse me, before I became a cop.
[00:52:51.497 --> 00:52:57.301]  But you sort of become that, and I think that insulates you even more so than a citizen.
[00:52:59.716 --> 00:53:01.717]  Not a citizen, you know what I mean?
[00:53:01.997 --> 00:53:04.218]  No, I understand the general public, the civilians.
[00:53:04.559 --> 00:53:05.159]  Yeah, the civilians.
[00:53:05.399 --> 00:53:11.342]  But the bottom line is, historically, police are one of the most abused groups by corrupt systems.
[00:53:11.822 --> 00:53:14.563]  And so police need to know, historically, you're not immune.
[00:53:14.964 --> 00:53:17.325]  In fact, you're going to get the dirty end of the stick, generally.
[00:53:19.226 --> 00:53:25.969]  I mean, did the New World Order care about the cops and firemen when they blocked the treatment for the dust?
[00:53:26.229 --> 00:53:28.110]  When they told you the dust wasn't bad?
[00:53:29.758 --> 00:53:33.419]  Well, you know, I went for all the tests and I'm healthy as a horse.
[00:53:33.779 --> 00:53:35.460]  No, that's good, but it did kill a lot of people.
[00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:36.460]  Yes, it did.
[00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:37.380]  That's confirmed.
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:38.761]  I mean, Mount Sinai.
[00:53:38.781 --> 00:53:40.961]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:53:41.301 --> 00:53:46.043]  And remember, the government tried to deny that for four years, but now they have all the CAT scans of thousands.
[00:53:46.363 --> 00:53:47.323]  Thousands are dead.
[00:53:48.783 --> 00:53:52.845]  So, good thing that didn't happen to you.
[00:53:52.865 --> 00:53:54.225]  Did you get a breathing mask pretty quick?
[00:53:55.702 --> 00:53:58.104]  No, I pretty much had a spackle mask on the whole time.
[00:53:58.305 --> 00:53:59.726]  Well, you were smart to have that, brother.
[00:53:59.766 --> 00:54:00.587]  That's probably what saved you.
[00:54:01.147 --> 00:54:02.308]  Yeah.
[00:54:03.789 --> 00:54:17.741]  Getting back to the overlying point is that what happened here is so overwhelming that for the average human being to wrap their minds around it, that's where it becomes the issue.
[00:54:17.761 --> 00:54:19.202]  I think that's the core issue.
[00:54:19.682 --> 00:54:21.564]  And you speak to it so eloquently.
[00:54:22.695 --> 00:54:25.836]  But it's just difficult for me to turn people on.
[00:54:25.856 --> 00:54:26.657]  Here's an example.
[00:54:26.877 --> 00:54:35.480]  I knew 15 years ago, 13 years ago when I got on air, that most pork you buy at the store, raw pork, has live worms in it that will eat your brain.
[00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:37.880]  Now I tell people that and they laugh at me.
[00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:43.482]  Now I play a Fox News clip about how suddenly thousands of people are having their brains eaten by these worms.
[00:54:43.842 --> 00:54:44.803]  People finally listen.
[00:54:45.063 --> 00:54:50.785]  Who would believe that there's worms eating people's brains and that nobody's trying to stop these pigs from Mexico coming in?
[00:54:51.345 --> 00:54:55.968]  You know, I'm not making that up, and I'm not making up that 9-11 is an inside job either.
[00:54:56.588 --> 00:54:59.469]  So, you know, I don't know what to say to people.
[00:54:59.690 --> 00:55:04.192]  There's people right now on my website saying we're making it up about the worms that eat people's brains.
[00:55:05.893 --> 00:55:10.756]  So, I mean, I can't do anything other than just tell people that, okay, if you don't want to believe us, that's fine.
[00:55:11.036 --> 00:55:12.877]  But the evidence is over.
[00:55:13.237 --> 00:55:16.539]  We're going to come back in a long segment, and I want to specifically get into
[00:55:18.732 --> 00:55:25.737]  You know, where this goes in your department, challenging people, you know, the types of responses you get, but keep making your points.
[00:55:27.518 --> 00:55:45.890]  Well, again, what I think, collectively, what police should do, especially 9-11 survivors, there needs to be a coalition, and that's what I'm going to try to attempt to do, because I don't trust government at all.
[00:55:46.411 --> 00:55:46.871]  I understand.
[00:55:47.526 --> 00:55:50.007]  But I do trust people, and there's a lot of good people in the government.
[00:55:50.887 --> 00:56:04.393]  So what I want to do is move forward and try to establish just a group of people that can, first of all, wrap their minds around this, and then move forward from there.
[00:56:06.837 --> 00:56:09.400]  Yeah, I would call it police and military for 9-11 truth.
[00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:11.422]  I think they already have similar groups.
[00:56:11.902 --> 00:56:22.213]  Now, you know, what was it, the daughter of the supposed Flight 77 in New Jersey, they admitted was murdered by arson by a can of gas in the face in her hallway.
[00:56:22.233 --> 00:56:25.937]  So I'm just telling you, be careful, Officer Carroll.
[00:56:26.478 --> 00:56:28.480]  I know you're not stupid, but I'm telling you, they will
[00:56:29.451 --> 00:56:31.012]  We're on the march.
[00:56:31.032 --> 00:56:31.973]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:56:31.993 --> 00:56:33.154]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:57.722 --> 00:57:02.024]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:57:02.264 --> 00:57:07.147]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:57:07.347 --> 00:57:08.668]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.

[00:57:57.695 --> 00:58:03.176]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:58:03.416 --> 00:58:04.696]  And we knew what to do.
[00:58:04.716 --> 00:58:06.516]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:58:06.736 --> 00:58:13.158]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:58:13.758 --> 00:58:18.939]  Whitman, EPA Director on the 18th, made a statement.
[00:58:19.909 --> 00:58:22.351]  That the air was safe to breathe.
[00:58:22.671 --> 00:58:29.476]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:58:29.776 --> 00:58:32.858]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:58:32.938 --> 00:58:38.182]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

[00:58:51.698 --> 00:58:52.760]  Government-sponsored terror.

[00:58:57.170 --> 00:59:00.457]  Aging doesn't only show in your face, but it can be felt in your body.

[00:59:57.968 --> 01:00:03.589]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:03.609 --> 01:00:09.030]  All right, we're back live.
[01:00:09.070 --> 01:00:11.531]  Lew Podolsky waiting in the wings.
[01:00:11.951 --> 01:00:18.912]  Detective John Carroll from Jersey City, New Jersey joins us, 9-11 first responder, survivor, hero.
[01:00:19.992 --> 01:00:24.633]  And we have so many types of police, firemen, emergency responders.
[01:00:25.666 --> 01:00:32.208]  I want to play one right now from an EMT who was on the site.
[01:00:32.228 --> 01:00:36.510]  Just a brief clip and then we're going to go back to the police officer and others.
[01:00:37.170 --> 01:00:39.051]  But here is that clip.
[01:00:41.751 --> 01:00:44.352]  It's the next video clip on the DVD.
[01:00:44.472 --> 01:00:45.673]  Yes, from Truth Rising.
[01:00:45.713 --> 01:00:46.053]  Here it is.
[01:00:46.073 --> 01:00:48.494]  My name is Kevin McPadden.
[01:00:48.654 --> 01:00:51.995]  I was a first responder on 9-11 and I'm a prior Air Force medic.
[01:00:53.061 --> 01:00:53.641]  He was there.
[01:00:54.261 --> 01:00:59.743]  He was there when Building 7 came down, and he clearly hears the countdown of the building being demolished.
[01:01:00.504 --> 01:01:04.845]  On the first day, on 9-11, we're staged north of Building 7.
[01:01:05.886 --> 01:01:08.647]  Amy Goodman was out in the intersection part.
[01:01:09.127 --> 01:01:10.267]  World Trade Center, Building 7.
[01:01:10.307 --> 01:01:10.827]  Your opinion?
[01:01:11.568 --> 01:01:14.208]  I think it needs to be further investigated.
[01:01:16.009 --> 01:01:21.051]  They had half of us separate into search and rescue, and half of us into medical assistance.
[01:01:23.283 --> 01:01:31.408]  When we saw the firemen pick up and start grabbing their equipment and bustling back and forth, you know, they were getting ready to do something, we started asking questions.
[01:01:32.609 --> 01:01:36.351]  And so we had our eyes on this Red Cross representative that was holding a radio.
[01:01:36.891 --> 01:01:39.833]  So, you know, usually the person who's holding the radio has answers.
[01:01:41.274 --> 01:01:42.094]  Well, what's going on?
[01:01:42.214 --> 01:01:42.875]  What's going on?
[01:01:43.055 --> 01:01:44.756]  Well, what are the firemen running around for?
[01:01:44.776 --> 01:01:46.097]  Like, there's something going on.
[01:01:47.810 --> 01:01:53.395]  And next thing you know, there's firemen grabbing all their equipment and there was a whole bustle and shuffle of firemen going on.
[01:01:53.755 --> 01:02:00.301]  He goes over, he talks to the firemen, he comes back with his hand covered over the radio and he's like, you know, just sit tight, just sit tight.
[01:02:00.841 --> 01:02:03.223]  Calm down, it's calm down, you know, it's alright.
[01:02:05.906 --> 01:02:08.608]  He finally has this face that is like he was heartbroken.
[01:02:09.068 --> 01:02:11.310]  He's like, just run for your life!
[01:02:13.370 --> 01:02:14.630]  Keep your eye on that building.
[01:02:14.690 --> 01:02:15.791]  It'll be coming down soon.
[01:02:15.811 --> 01:02:17.831]  The building is about to blow up.
[01:02:17.851 --> 01:02:18.371]  Move it back.
[01:02:19.191 --> 01:02:21.652]  Rescue workers push people away from the scene.
[01:02:22.092 --> 01:02:24.673]  We are walking back to the building.
[01:02:24.733 --> 01:02:26.493]  It's about to blow up.
[01:02:26.533 --> 01:02:32.375]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:02:40.788 --> 01:02:42.730]  I said, you know, we've had such a terrible loss of life.
[01:02:43.811 --> 01:02:45.733]  Maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it.
[01:02:47.135 --> 01:02:48.657]  And they made that decision to pull.
[01:02:48.997 --> 01:02:51.440]  And then we watched the building collapse.
[01:02:57.935 --> 01:02:59.537]  Bridgegate is an amazing individual.
[01:02:59.557 --> 01:03:00.838]  He studied architecture.
[01:03:01.258 --> 01:03:02.620]  Again, that's from Truth Rising.
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:06.643]  That's where everybody needs to get the DVD, make copies of it, get it out to everybody.
[01:03:06.703 --> 01:03:13.210]  This is probably the most important 9-11 film out there just because it gets into every aspect of it, including the movement.
[01:03:14.858 --> 01:03:19.622]  But, you know, it's not just that witness or all the other firemen or police or emergency workers.
[01:03:19.762 --> 01:03:26.729]  It's that we even then have the video of Amy Goodman in the shot he's talking about with he and others milling around in the shot.
[01:03:26.749 --> 01:03:28.550]  You can even see him there in the blurred video.
[01:03:29.611 --> 01:03:33.215]  And then we talked to Amy Goodman and she admits she remembers it.
[01:03:34.304 --> 01:03:37.168]  And we have the footage of the cops saying, get back, it's coming down.
[01:03:37.769 --> 01:03:38.730]  They're going to bring it down.
[01:03:38.790 --> 01:03:46.420]  I mean, we don't just have eyewitnesses, we have live CNN and MSNBC news feeds of it happening.
[01:03:48.689 --> 01:04:08.509]  Again, Officer, Detective John Carroll, I mean, what do you call that in a case when the evidence piles up and piles up and piles up and piles up and piles up and piles up and piles up and piles up and then it's all in our face and then they tell us, don't even discuss it, don't even look at it, what do you call that?
[01:04:09.907 --> 01:04:12.208]  Well, just a preponderance of evidence.
[01:04:15.068 --> 01:04:15.688]  What do you mean by that?
[01:04:16.148 --> 01:04:17.909]  Well, I mean, it's a two-parter.
[01:04:17.949 --> 01:04:25.730]  I mean, yeah, I mean, just an overwhelming open and shut case in your face, hidden in plain view, but yeah, and then they just cover that up.
[01:04:25.770 --> 01:04:31.051]  I mean, it's like an elephant sitting on you in the living room and people are saying there's not an elephant in here.
[01:04:31.631 --> 01:04:39.473]  Well, oftentimes in law enforcement, see, again, Alex, I have to be very careful of how I address questions because I'm still held to protocol.
[01:04:40.533 --> 01:04:49.598]  So even commenting about police work, that would give them... How would you get in trouble?
[01:04:49.778 --> 01:04:51.419]  I mean, you don't lose your First Amendment, do you?
[01:04:51.439 --> 01:04:56.341]  You're not even allowed to comment on the 9-11 investigation, or what are you saying?
[01:04:57.261 --> 01:04:57.702]  Well, no.
[01:04:58.602 --> 01:05:08.387]  When it comes to just police work in general, what I'm saying about 9-11, that's going to bring, from my standpoint, things to a forefront.
[01:05:09.048 --> 01:05:09.348]  Yes.
[01:05:09.688 --> 01:05:11.570]  The minute I retire, I'll come on your show for
[01:05:28.464 --> 01:05:31.706]  Anytime, if you'd graciously have me, and I'll speak out in order.
[01:05:31.726 --> 01:05:32.166]  No, sure.
[01:05:32.627 --> 01:05:35.809]  Yesterday, when I got the message relayed from Aaron, I must have misunderstood it.
[01:05:35.849 --> 01:05:39.230]  It was that you're basically throwing down the gauntlet to the department.
[01:05:39.251 --> 01:05:40.191]  Can you clarify that?
[01:05:41.192 --> 01:05:46.455]  Well, what I want to do, and it was sort of short notice, and everyone's on vacation right now.
[01:05:46.495 --> 01:05:49.817]  What I want to do is basically say, I'm not going to work.
[01:05:50.417 --> 01:05:51.578]  Now, I'm a 15-year veteran.
[01:05:52.018 --> 01:05:52.998]  I got all the bells and whistles.
[01:05:53.018 --> 01:05:53.779]  I don't want to go into my
[01:05:54.815 --> 01:06:03.962]  Well, we were talking before the show, and you were talking about the fact that you did swear an oath.
[01:06:21.175 --> 01:06:22.936]  And that oath is to the people, like you said.
[01:06:22.976 --> 01:06:27.018]  It's not to some shadowy intelligence agency that controls the government.
[01:06:27.859 --> 01:06:28.319]  Absolutely.
[01:06:28.819 --> 01:06:31.521]  And I want to speak to all military and police listening right now.
[01:06:33.022 --> 01:06:34.202]  And I'm sure there are a lot.
[01:06:34.703 --> 01:06:35.583]  We swore an oath, people.
[01:06:36.404 --> 01:06:37.624]  This is what you're supposed to be doing.
[01:06:38.585 --> 01:06:39.846]  I don't trust government, never did.
[01:06:40.346 --> 01:06:41.607]  But I trust people in government.
[01:06:41.987 --> 01:06:44.668]  There's enough of us out there that we're not going to let this happen.
[01:06:45.609 --> 01:06:46.629]  We're simply not going to let it happen.
[01:06:48.951 --> 01:06:51.172]  If I'm threatened with death or whatever, I'm a trained professional.
[01:06:52.393 --> 01:06:53.213]  I don't have to cut myself.
[01:06:54.034 --> 01:06:57.235]  And if anybody's planning on doing anything, you know what?
[01:06:57.255 --> 01:06:58.015]  You better send a lot of them.
[01:07:01.177 --> 01:07:04.018]  But, you know, police reconcile their mortality.
[01:07:04.379 --> 01:07:05.079]  I know what I'm doing here.
[01:07:07.202 --> 01:07:08.023]  I will take you out!
[01:07:26.877 --> 01:07:28.558]  I face a lot of different type of dangers.
[01:07:28.618 --> 01:07:33.122]  My name being besmirched, being physically attacked, being audited, things like that.
[01:07:33.162 --> 01:07:38.507]  But it really is liberating in a way to just say I am who I am and I'm not backing down and that's just the end of it.
[01:07:39.147 --> 01:07:39.588]  Yes it is.
[01:07:40.068 --> 01:07:40.709]  It's very liberating.
[01:07:41.289 --> 01:07:46.214]  But as police officers, I think as people in general, I think that's just a human quality.
[01:07:46.674 --> 01:07:52.419]  Once you get past that point of fear that you speak to, that's when you do make that quantum leap.
[01:07:55.127 --> 01:07:57.950]  I've stayed quiet too long.
[01:07:58.391 --> 01:07:59.752]  It was because of my job that I did.
[01:08:01.814 --> 01:08:04.917]  I took my profession seriously.
[01:08:04.937 --> 01:08:06.979]  It provides food for my family.
[01:08:07.439 --> 01:08:14.246]  But I'm compensated for the privilege of helping people.
[01:08:14.861 --> 01:08:15.241]  Imagine that.
[01:08:15.261 --> 01:08:17.103]  Imagine being paid to be a hero.
[01:08:17.663 --> 01:08:22.747]  It's a sacred office as long as it's controlled by the people and a good thing.
[01:08:22.807 --> 01:08:31.133]  It's too bad this corrupt system has been corrupting that and destroying something that really was honorable and still can be salvaged.
[01:08:31.513 --> 01:08:36.897]  What woke you up, Detective Carroll, first to the fact that things were shady surrounding 9-11?
[01:08:36.917 --> 01:08:40.460]  Well, actually on 9-11 itself.
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:43.082]  Again, I'm not a structural engineer and that's where
[01:08:43.843 --> 01:08:50.447]  Richard Gage comes in, and he can speak to it much more articulately than I can from a structural standpoint.
[01:08:50.767 --> 01:08:58.272]  But there was a makeshift, I can speak to this, there was a makeshift mall gun, excuse me, on Liberty Island.
[01:08:59.173 --> 01:09:00.914]  That's what, you know, Statue of Liberty right there.
[01:09:01.674 --> 01:09:05.157]  And we were expecting 20,000 bodies.
[01:09:05.397 --> 01:09:08.159]  It was, it was very hectic that day.
[01:09:09.099 --> 01:09:13.302]  I sort of, I sort of try to forget it.
[01:09:14.414 --> 01:09:29.719]  Try to subliminally push it down, but my XO at the time, now I wasn't there, I wasn't present when he heard it, but he was in civilian, he was in civvies, he was in civilian clothing.
[01:09:30.339 --> 01:09:32.760]  So he was mistakenly taken in as military.
[01:09:33.401 --> 01:09:43.224]  Now I didn't hear this, I wasn't there, but he was taken into a briefing and they had a satellite overlay of ground zero.
[01:09:43.652 --> 01:09:45.953]  What a bunch of, uh, you know, red dots.
[01:09:46.953 --> 01:09:48.814]  And it was, uh, UEDs.
[01:09:49.974 --> 01:09:50.814]  Unexploded Devices.
[01:09:52.695 --> 01:09:54.315]  Now, that's not hearsay.
[01:09:55.035 --> 01:09:55.635]  He told me that.
[01:09:56.236 --> 01:09:57.116]  I won't say his name on air.
[01:09:58.256 --> 01:10:03.638]  But they, you know, it was Army Corps of Engineers, it was, uh, all branches of the military.
[01:10:04.238 --> 01:10:06.139]  And then, there were actually passes.
[01:10:06.759 --> 01:10:08.499]  Now that I saw, they actually had passes.
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:11.140]  Printed passes to get in.
[01:10:12.847 --> 01:10:18.869]  Yeah, they were already ready within hours to control the crime scene because they needed to control it.
[01:10:19.310 --> 01:10:21.710]  They needed to make sure that that evidence was covered up.
[01:10:23.251 --> 01:10:26.112]  I want to go to Luke Rodowski here in a few minutes, but I want to keep you on.
[01:10:26.572 --> 01:10:36.756]  Specifically, when you first called in yesterday, you were, and we ran out of time, you were talking about, you know, other issues, other instances.
[01:10:36.776 --> 01:10:38.017]  You mentioned 93.
[01:10:38.077 --> 01:10:40.818]  You mentioned other things that had happened.
[01:10:41.636 --> 01:10:50.323]  Well, there's all, there's all, the blind sheik, the blind sheik, see again, I'm treading on ground here, but the blind sheik.
[01:10:50.763 --> 01:10:53.365]  Shake Abdel Rahman out of the New Jersey Pizza Place.
[01:10:53.866 --> 01:10:57.609]  Yeah, right above, it was above the police place, that's in Journal Square.
[01:10:58.169 --> 01:11:01.892]  There is all kinds of intel that we simply don't have access to.
[01:11:02.673 --> 01:11:06.936]  And we're the New Jersey City Police Department, how would the, we don't have a terrorist task force?
[01:11:08.962 --> 01:11:14.540]  We should be... If it is a so-called hotbed of terrorist activity...
[01:11:15.086 --> 01:11:17.567]  How are we not involved?
[01:11:17.807 --> 01:11:22.388]  You know about Ahmad Salam, the FBI hires him, they have him cook the bomb, train the driver.
[01:11:22.408 --> 01:11:28.770]  This is real Muslim terrorists, but they literally create the group, point it at the trade center, tell them to park it up against the pillar.
[01:11:28.810 --> 01:11:29.670]  Thank God they didn't.
[01:11:30.230 --> 01:11:33.511]  That's on record because Ahmad Salam figured out they were setting him up.
[01:11:34.191 --> 01:11:37.772]  He wasn't really a Muslim extremist, he had been hired to do this by the FBI.
[01:11:38.052 --> 01:11:40.613]  He recorded them, so they had to pay him a million three.
[01:11:41.793 --> 01:11:49.436]  But I mean, look, it's been in the New York Papers, the New Jersey Papers, the Pennsylvania Papers, that the firefighters and police found three of the four boxes.
[01:11:50.076 --> 01:11:53.238]  That's actually come out in congressional testimony, and the FBI seized them.
[01:11:53.658 --> 01:11:53.998]  Why?
[01:11:54.098 --> 01:11:55.279]  Grab the flight recorders.
[01:11:55.419 --> 01:11:56.519]  What are they covering up?
[01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:01.661]  The way it works, Alex, it really is like TV.
[01:12:02.362 --> 01:12:03.942]  I mean, it really is like the movies.
[01:12:04.182 --> 01:12:08.324]  The way they portray the relationship between local police and FBI.
[01:12:08.344 --> 01:12:10.685]  You know when the Fed comes on the scene and
[01:12:11.229 --> 01:12:14.451]  You know, the local cop just flips them off.
[01:12:14.731 --> 01:12:15.652]  That's pretty much the way it is.
[01:12:16.072 --> 01:12:20.055]  We're just glorified security guards.
[01:12:20.135 --> 01:12:21.376]  So we don't have access to this.
[01:12:21.536 --> 01:12:29.061]  Well, the way it's supposed to work, unless it was a federal marshal with a directive from the President or the Congress, they're not supposed to be involved.
[01:12:29.121 --> 01:12:33.444]  You see, everything is ass-backwards, excuse that term, but that's what it is.
[01:12:33.464 --> 01:12:34.925]  It's all backwards.
[01:12:35.285 --> 01:12:39.328]  The states are supposed to be sovereign, and they're supposed to kiss your boots, not the other way around.
[01:12:40.919 --> 01:12:41.959]  Yeah, but you know what?
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:47.802]  To take that posture, what you want to do is, I mean, I think we just need more access.
[01:12:48.802 --> 01:12:53.544]  No, I know, but that's not going to happen as long as we have Feds running things.
[01:12:53.584 --> 01:12:58.807]  Look, the Feds covered up for Madoff while he stole not a fifty, but a hundred billion bucks.
[01:12:59.847 --> 01:13:01.668]  Okay, and now they're covering for him again.
[01:13:01.688 --> 01:13:04.649]  So, I mean, it's just the Feds aren't foreign.
[01:13:04.849 --> 01:13:07.330]  It's a foreign bank has hijacked America.
[01:13:07.390 --> 01:13:08.331]  It's a corporate takeover.
[01:13:09.011 --> 01:13:25.695]  Any other key points concerning 9-11 or anything else about your XO, your commander, going in there and into that military briefing, out there at the makeshift morgue, out there at the Statue of Liberty, and anything else he saw on those overlays?
[01:13:25.735 --> 01:13:28.596]  Any other little tidbits that are important for people out there?
[01:13:28.616 --> 01:13:38.078]  No, it was basically an overlay map, satellite overlay, and again, I didn't see this, this is a corner of my XO, and that
[01:13:39.353 --> 01:13:42.295]  The Army Corps had sealed it off.
[01:13:42.315 --> 01:13:44.136]  Now, that was later on that night.
[01:13:44.176 --> 01:13:46.337]  That was actually after Plaza 7 fell.
[01:13:46.777 --> 01:13:50.360]  So, I got evacuated from Battery Park.
[01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:54.522]  So, we went directly from Battery Park to Liberty Island.
[01:13:55.302 --> 01:14:03.207]  Now, we just sort of brushed each other as he went in.
[01:14:03.667 --> 01:14:08.110]  And then when he came out, he had this befuddled look on his face, and I asked him, I said,
[01:14:09.727 --> 01:14:12.288]  Oh, what's going on?
[01:14:12.668 --> 01:14:14.908]  Actually, my badge number was 9-11 on 9-11.
[01:14:16.069 --> 01:14:20.190]  And he looked at my badge and he goes, you know your badge number?
[01:14:20.250 --> 01:14:22.471]  I remember he was the first individual to say that to me.
[01:14:22.811 --> 01:14:23.571]  That's amazing.
[01:14:23.971 --> 01:14:27.972]  Well, I mean, I know you had Richard Gage into town to speak to folks.
[01:14:27.992 --> 01:14:30.213]  Did that have an effect on your colleagues?
[01:14:31.353 --> 01:14:31.533]  No.
[01:14:33.194 --> 01:14:36.434]  You know, again, I think it's just a befuddlement.
[01:14:36.674 --> 01:14:38.475]  I think people just can't wrap their minds around it.
[01:14:39.406 --> 01:14:44.107]  And to tell you the truth, you know what they're most likely going to do?
[01:14:44.127 --> 01:14:45.008]  I'm a 15-year vet.
[01:14:46.488 --> 01:14:48.629]  They're going to wind up sending me for a psych.
[01:14:49.149 --> 01:14:50.989]  I'm staying as the next guy.
[01:14:51.930 --> 01:14:53.830]  But I know what I'm up against here.
[01:14:54.530 --> 01:14:55.191]  I know what's going to happen.
[01:14:55.211 --> 01:15:02.393]  Yeah, and I guess if you show all the CNN clips of them saying they blew the building up, I guess all them need psych evaluations as well, right?
[01:15:04.266 --> 01:15:07.068]  Testosterone driven, you know, knuckleheads
[01:15:34.466 --> 01:15:37.028]  You mean the new chapter that we have in our organization?
[01:15:49.144 --> 01:15:56.128]  Well, just two weeks ago we had Jesse Ventura and many Not 11 family members and rescue workers down at Ground Zero.
[01:15:56.148 --> 01:16:02.592]  We're out there every Saturday giving out free DVDs and free flyers to the public out there about the truth behind Not 11.
[01:16:03.292 --> 01:16:08.235]  And two weeks ago we had Jesse Ventura, and then last week we had one of our supporters.
[01:16:08.295 --> 01:16:15.159]  We have many supporters at the Ground Zero community that support us and are huge fans of ours, but are not members.
[01:16:15.772 --> 01:16:16.473]  I don't know.
[01:16:32.475 --> 01:16:34.656]  Family members, rescue workers down at Ground Zero.
[01:16:35.116 --> 01:16:39.997]  And, you know, that's why they came down there, because we're having a huge effect at Ground Zero.
[01:16:40.017 --> 01:16:43.558]  You know, I haven't been keeping touch with Jesse or you guys.
[01:16:43.618 --> 01:16:46.939]  I've been so busy on other things, but I didn't know Ventura was up in New York.
[01:16:47.999 --> 01:16:49.940]  I wish you guys would let me know about that, how to come in.
[01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:52.801]  Jesse Ventura was there for only a little bit.
[01:16:52.821 --> 01:16:55.901]  He was shooting a pilot for his series that he's working on.
[01:16:55.921 --> 01:16:58.002]  Yeah, I knew he was going back to New York for that, yeah.
[01:16:58.507 --> 01:16:59.928]  Yeah, and he stopped by Ground Zero.
[01:16:59.968 --> 01:17:01.989]  We had a lot of family members, a lot of rescue workers.
[01:17:02.109 --> 01:17:05.851]  It was an amazing day two weeks ago at Ground Zero.
[01:17:05.991 --> 01:17:07.491]  How long was he at Ground Zero?
[01:17:08.212 --> 01:17:08.612]  What happened?
[01:17:08.952 --> 01:17:10.193]  How long was he at Ground Zero?
[01:17:10.613 --> 01:17:13.854]  He was only there for, you know, about around an hour or so.
[01:17:13.894 --> 01:17:14.695]  Not that long at all.
[01:17:15.635 --> 01:17:16.676]  I need to give him a call.
[01:17:16.736 --> 01:17:17.876]  He emailed me the other day.
[01:17:17.916 --> 01:17:20.838]  I need to give him a call because I'm working with him on that.
[01:17:20.878 --> 01:17:22.259]  We'll see where that TV program goes.
[01:17:22.899 --> 01:17:27.101]  Luke, what do you think of Detective John Carroll and what he has to say?
[01:17:27.577 --> 01:17:28.737]  I mean, it's a beautiful thing.
[01:17:28.777 --> 01:17:32.619]  We definitely need more police officers and more people in the military on our side.
[01:17:32.659 --> 01:17:36.520]  We get a lot of support, again, in the community at Ground Zero from a lot of people.
[01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:42.442]  And it's sad seeing these people being questioned and harassed by the FBI about our organization.
[01:17:43.027 --> 01:17:44.067]  Again, we have nothing to hide.
[01:17:44.107 --> 01:17:45.488]  We're a peaceful organization.
[01:17:45.528 --> 01:17:52.110]  We want to work with the police, with the military, against the elite, against the New World Order that enslave us.
[01:17:52.130 --> 01:17:53.151]  Now, stay there, stay there.
[01:17:53.351 --> 01:17:56.072]  Fighting for the interest of the United States against the New World Order.
[01:17:56.152 --> 01:17:57.052]  We're the true patriots.
[01:17:57.272 --> 01:18:02.594]  Ionic Zone has the lowest prices in the USA on shock treatment ozone generators, starting at $299.
[01:18:04.375 --> 01:18:17.240]  Ionic Zone Shock Treatment Ozone Generators are used by remediation contractors and homeowners alike to sterilize homes and cars, making them free from bacteria, molds, viruses, and complete removal of second-hand smoke, pet odors, you name it.
[01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:20.701]  What else can three oxygen atoms, in other words, ozone, do?
[01:18:21.001 --> 01:18:25.483]  Many hospitals sterilize their operating rooms with ozone before and after operations.
[01:18:25.763 --> 01:18:27.645]  And have you ever heard of ozone therapy?
[01:18:27.865 --> 01:18:31.127]  Ionic Zone has a wealth of information on ozone therapy.
[01:18:31.428 --> 01:18:38.053]  Ozone therapy is used, among other things, to raise the body's oxygen level, which studies suggest boosts the immune system.
[01:18:38.253 --> 01:18:45.119]  You can learn more about ozone therapy or Ionic Zone ozone generators by going to ioniczone.com or calling 800-549-9535.
[01:18:48.001 --> 01:18:54.567]  That's I-O-N-I-C, zone, dot com, or toll free, 800-549-9535, Ionic Zone.
[01:18:54.787 --> 01:19:03.576]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:19:03.956 --> 01:19:05.618]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:19:06.590 --> 01:19:07.611]  But who is the enemy?
[01:19:08.131 --> 01:19:08.632]  Bin Laden.
[01:19:08.932 --> 01:19:09.893]  This is his M.O.
[01:19:09.913 --> 01:19:11.234]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:19:11.254 --> 01:19:12.895]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:19:13.295 --> 01:19:20.041]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:19:20.441 --> 01:19:20.881]  Some U.S.
[01:19:20.921 --> 01:19:26.586]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:19:27.266 --> 01:19:30.748]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:19:30.768 --> 01:19:33.569]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:19:57.398 --> 01:20:00.399]  So you've finally decided you're going to stock up and store food.
[01:20:00.699 --> 01:20:02.820]  But why settle for bland, tasteless food?
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:04.340]  Why settle for less?
[01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:05.960]  There is an alternative.
[01:20:06.321 --> 01:20:07.781]  InternetGrocer.net.

[01:20:27.867 --> 01:20:30.548]  Choose a variety pack or an entire year's worth of food.

[01:20:44.372 --> 01:20:45.312]  That's 903-356-6443.
[01:20:47.793 --> 01:20:48.633]  Open from 9 a.m.
[01:20:48.673 --> 01:20:49.353]  to 6 p.m.
[01:20:49.393 --> 01:20:50.373]  Central Standard Time.
[01:20:50.634 --> 01:20:53.654]  Or shop online at internet-grocer.net.
[01:20:53.894 --> 01:20:56.495]  Again, that's internet-grocer.net.
[01:21:08.798 --> 01:21:13.359]  Don't call my name out your window when I'm leaving.
[01:21:14.818 --> 01:21:17.242]  I won't even turn my head.
[01:21:19.706 --> 01:21:23.773]  Don't send your kinfolks to give me no talking.
[01:21:26.188 --> 01:21:30.451]  Yeah, it was lonely.
[01:21:30.691 --> 01:21:36.415]  Years before 9-11, making films about government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:21:36.435 --> 01:21:37.996]  Like America Destroyed by Design in 97.
[01:21:38.036 --> 01:21:38.577]  Police State 2000.
[01:21:38.637 --> 01:21:40.398]  And other documentaries.
[01:21:46.062 --> 01:21:51.427]  And then months before 9-11 saying, call the White House, tell them don't blow up the World Trade Center.
[01:21:51.447 --> 01:21:57.632]  First and only time I've said call the White House and tell them don't blow up the buildings.
[01:21:58.633 --> 01:22:04.879]  Because I can see all the preparation on the news, the preparation of the public mind, and that's on record.
[01:22:07.875 --> 01:22:13.959]  You know that aired many times on AXS TV that I aired July 25th live and I turned the tape in that day and it aired a few times.
[01:22:13.999 --> 01:22:17.702]  It aired on the morning of 9-11 again and we got a bunch of death threats.
[01:22:18.062 --> 01:22:22.565]  People thought I was on there on the day saying it was an inside job when it was two months old.
[01:22:22.625 --> 01:22:28.609]  But Jimmy Vaughn, my good friend, who I didn't even know at the time, he saw me live say call the White House.
[01:22:28.669 --> 01:22:29.750]  He was on the fence about me.
[01:22:30.750 --> 01:22:37.215]  And then two months later he saw the attack on the World Trade Centers and he said, oh my God, this stuff is really accurate.
[01:22:38.877 --> 01:22:45.145]  So I'm on record saying that and that's what studying these people can do for you.
[01:22:46.127 --> 01:22:48.710]  You can really understand where they're going to strike next.
[01:22:49.251 --> 01:22:51.213]  Their basic psychology, their criminology.
[01:22:53.533 --> 01:22:57.715]  I want to hold Luke and Detective John Carroll over five minutes to the next segment.
[01:22:57.735 --> 01:23:01.077]  Then we have the author of Target Patent.
[01:23:01.157 --> 01:23:03.759]  It's now come out that what we already knew was true.
[01:23:03.779 --> 01:23:12.584]  The CIA with the NKVD, what was OSS at the time, with the NKVD killed George S. Patton because he wanted, he didn't want
[01:23:13.916 --> 01:23:16.137]  To let the Russians keep 12,000 U.S.
[01:23:16.197 --> 01:23:18.799]  soldiers that had been captured by the Nazis.
[01:23:18.819 --> 01:23:22.081]  The Russians took over those camps and said, we want them for slave labor and for intel.
[01:23:22.861 --> 01:23:24.723]  And Patton said, hell no, I'm going public.
[01:23:24.743 --> 01:23:26.564]  And they said, die!
[01:23:26.844 --> 01:23:27.064]  U.S.
[01:23:27.084 --> 01:23:28.485]  government, die sucker!
[01:23:29.505 --> 01:23:31.967]  Troops don't mean jack squat to us.
[01:23:32.427 --> 01:23:33.828]  That's now mainstream news.
[01:23:34.208 --> 01:23:41.473]  So for the cops out there that can't believe this, can't get it through their heads, or the public can't get it through their heads, they killed Patton over this stuff.
[01:23:41.933 --> 01:23:43.254]  They think of you as dog meat.
[01:23:45.427 --> 01:23:54.510]  Any comments on the dust, on Patton, just on any of this historically, Detective Carroll, and then Luke?
[01:23:57.372 --> 01:24:00.733]  Well, I believe they're capable of doing pretty much anything.
[01:24:01.233 --> 01:24:05.175]  So, I don't know enough about the topic.
[01:24:05.935 --> 01:24:08.216]  I would have to research it, but I take you at your word.
[01:24:09.976 --> 01:24:13.098]  A quick moment of private time.
[01:24:14.540 --> 01:24:15.541]  A little light-hearted thing.
[01:24:16.121 --> 01:24:27.486]  I really appreciated you when you were talking to Richard Gage, when you were interviewing, I should say, Richard Gage, and he was speaking about the imposing hit piece that's going to be coming.
[01:24:28.007 --> 01:24:29.447]  Oh, yeah.
[01:24:30.048 --> 01:24:31.929]  I like the way you presented it.
[01:24:32.049 --> 01:24:33.489]  It was almost like, buckle up, pal.
[01:24:34.290 --> 01:24:36.951]  Wake up to reality.
[01:24:36.971 --> 01:24:39.012]  Rich is a good man, but he's a great man.
[01:24:41.454 --> 01:24:45.598]  Very articulate, I mean, accomplished, but there is a very nuanced, naive, I'd say.
[01:24:49.658 --> 01:24:52.641]  You know how this business works, pal?
[01:24:53.221 --> 01:24:54.502]  Buckle up!
[01:24:55.263 --> 01:24:58.966]  He's like Beaver and the other guys like Eddie Haskell.
[01:24:59.186 --> 01:25:01.548]  And I don't say that just as my opinion.
[01:25:01.949 --> 01:25:09.035]  They have a hit piece specialist who makes films only attacking the alternative media, JFK researchers.
[01:25:09.495 --> 01:25:10.836]  So he is a specialist.
[01:25:11.637 --> 01:25:15.200]  Luke Rudowsky, your comments on the media and all these hit pieces coming out against us.
[01:25:16.752 --> 01:25:17.752]  Well, again, they don't care.
[01:25:17.773 --> 01:25:19.013]  They don't care about the family members.
[01:25:19.033 --> 01:25:20.434]  They don't care about the rest of the workers.
[01:25:20.454 --> 01:25:21.834]  They don't care about the police officers.
[01:25:21.854 --> 01:25:25.116]  It's about us getting the information out there and educating the people.
[01:25:28.758 --> 01:25:29.378]  Absolutely.
[01:25:29.438 --> 01:25:30.719]  Stay there, Luke Rudowski.
[01:25:31.459 --> 01:25:32.960]  And, of course, John Carroll.
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:35.261]  The fourth hour is straight ahead.

[01:26:00.823 --> 01:26:07.585]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[01:26:07.925 --> 01:26:11.507]  And the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:26:11.887 --> 01:26:15.048]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[01:26:15.289 --> 01:26:17.009]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[01:26:17.049 --> 01:26:22.792]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[01:26:50.125 --> 01:26:52.046]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:26:52.506 --> 01:26:55.308]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:27:06.886 --> 01:27:07.066]  Yeah.
[01:27:13.692 --> 01:27:16.092]  Alright, final segment with our two guests.
[01:27:17.413 --> 01:27:37.056]  Anything else you want to add, Detective Carroll, or your email, your contact points for other police, other peace officers in the New Jersey, New York surrounding area that want to join with you to form, I guess, police and military against the 9-11 cover-up, or for a 9-11 investigation, or whatever you want to call it.
[01:27:37.076 --> 01:27:38.416]  You want to give out a contact point?
[01:27:39.476 --> 01:27:42.137]  Yeah, email me at jmkj.
[01:27:43.727 --> 01:27:45.188]  918 at Comcast.net.
[01:27:46.849 --> 01:27:49.610]  Again, give that email out again slowly for folks, please, sir.
[01:27:50.311 --> 01:27:55.093]  JMKJ918 at Comcast.net.
[01:27:55.893 --> 01:28:01.336]  Alright, and come out to Ground Zero with Luke and the guys and the gals.
[01:28:01.876 --> 01:28:05.478]  I mean, I know you've been having some events of your own, but let's all join forces here.
[01:28:06.258 --> 01:28:10.340]  Oh, absolutely, and just leaving
[01:28:10.996 --> 01:28:14.238]  I just want to be very specific about this, because I am coming out.
[01:28:16.139 --> 01:28:18.380]  I am trained very well.
[01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:20.060]  I know exactly what I'm doing here.
[01:28:20.801 --> 01:28:21.921]  So I'm going to be very specific.
[01:28:22.161 --> 01:28:24.182]  I'm calling on all angels.
[01:28:25.203 --> 01:28:29.785]  That means I'm calling to all the patriots that are listening, especially military and police.
[01:28:30.485 --> 01:28:31.746]  This is our responsibility.
[01:28:33.887 --> 01:28:34.647]  This is what we're doing.
[01:28:35.468 --> 01:28:37.429]  Everybody, you're either going to be a hero or you're not.
[01:28:38.749 --> 01:28:40.010]  This is what we're trained to do.
[01:28:41.109 --> 01:28:41.549]  Wake up.
[01:28:42.130 --> 01:28:42.770]  Don't be a dope.
[01:28:44.012 --> 01:28:44.392]  Get a mitt.
[01:28:44.432 --> 01:28:44.912]  Get in the game.
[01:28:44.932 --> 01:28:46.934]  Because I think it's going to get worse from here.
[01:28:49.136 --> 01:28:49.797]  God bless you.
[01:28:49.877 --> 01:28:50.377]  Absolutely.
[01:28:50.417 --> 01:28:50.817]  Don't leave.
[01:28:50.857 --> 01:28:54.521]  I want to have Luke say hi to you here as well.
[01:28:54.841 --> 01:28:58.444]  Luke, I hope you guys get in touch with each other and I hope more people come out to Ground Zero.
[01:28:59.825 --> 01:29:02.788]  A recap here of where We Are Change is going right now.
[01:29:03.686 --> 01:29:05.067]  Right now, we're making a new film.
[01:29:05.127 --> 01:29:06.727]  Right now, we're working very hard.
[01:29:06.747 --> 01:29:08.028]  We're out there every Saturday.
[01:29:08.068 --> 01:29:09.788]  We're out there having meetings every Friday.
[01:29:09.828 --> 01:29:10.929]  We're doing excellent work.
[01:29:11.229 --> 01:29:13.370]  There's a lot of amazing, good people behind us.
[01:29:13.390 --> 01:29:14.830]  A lot of great police officers.
[01:29:15.451 --> 01:29:16.771]  I want to salute the detective.
[01:29:16.891 --> 01:29:18.792]  Thank him so much from the bottom of my heart.
[01:29:19.032 --> 01:29:24.434]  There's a lot of good cops out there, but we're also going through a lot of harassment by a lot of bad cops out there.
[01:29:24.934 --> 01:29:31.177]  Recently, we went out to confront Henry Polson, where I was confronted by police officers trying to arrest me for no reason.
[01:29:31.557 --> 01:29:43.968]  I have the video of the police officer basically stopping me, harassing me, screaming at me for no reason at all for standing on the street corner where Henry Paulson was supposed to be walking by.
[01:29:44.048 --> 01:29:44.988]  Well, he's our God!
[01:29:45.749 --> 01:29:47.450]  He's stolen $8.5 trillion.
[01:29:47.771 --> 01:29:49.172]  We have to love the foreign banker.
[01:29:50.313 --> 01:29:50.813]  Exactly.
[01:29:51.314 --> 01:29:56.458]  And the Secret Service even admitted when we ran up to Paulson and we asked him, how come you threaten martial law?
[01:29:56.860 --> 01:29:59.882]  How come you throw in Congress and the Senate with martial law?
[01:30:00.142 --> 01:30:04.384]  He grabbed the camera, and when Paulson got in his car, he was like, yeah, we were watching you all day.
[01:30:04.824 --> 01:30:11.567]  And then we heard everything that they were talking about with other people inside the event, that they overheard the Secret Service guys talking about us.
[01:30:11.668 --> 01:30:15.930]  Well, Luke, have you gotten this Paulson footage up on the web yet?
[01:30:16.910 --> 01:30:17.370]  Not yet.
[01:30:17.430 --> 01:30:18.171]  We're working on it.
[01:30:18.211 --> 01:30:19.592]  We're working on the film right now.
[01:30:19.612 --> 01:30:24.194]  Well, you know, did you get all the videos I just mailed you?
[01:30:25.345 --> 01:30:26.525]  I did not get anything yet.
[01:30:27.265 --> 01:30:33.227]  Okay, well I know I've seen Rob running around here dubbing videos for you guys to use for weeks, so I don't know what's going on.
[01:30:33.267 --> 01:30:34.607]  We just moved, it's quite a mess.
[01:30:36.128 --> 01:30:51.291]  But yet again, there's a lot of good police officers that need to educate all the other police officers because the level of harassment is really escalating with FBI officials talking to our supporters down at Ground Zero that are not even a part of our group, that are just there working, supporting us.
[01:30:51.673 --> 01:30:53.797]  So we need to educate as many people as we can.
[01:30:53.817 --> 01:31:03.955]  Well that's because the system is threatened and folks can find out more at WeAreChange.org and you've got a lot of new chapters, right Luke?
[01:31:04.605 --> 01:31:07.146]  Yeah, we have over 77 chapters all around the world.
[01:31:07.226 --> 01:31:08.707]  Our news chapter is in Hawaii.
[01:31:08.967 --> 01:31:13.490]  We're working every day all around the world, being the change that we want to see in this world.
[01:31:13.550 --> 01:31:14.730]  And nothing can stop us.
[01:31:14.850 --> 01:31:20.393]  Nothing can stop our spirit, our soul, in finding out what's really happened on 9-11 and fighting the justice.
[01:31:20.673 --> 01:31:29.558]  We have great people like Major Mike McCormick, firefighters like John Frodo, family members, you know, Manny Bedillo, Bob McLevain, being out there at Ground Zero with us.
[01:31:29.958 --> 01:31:32.299]  Talking to regular people that don't know what's going on.
[01:31:32.459 --> 01:31:32.819]  All right.
[01:31:33.319 --> 01:31:35.780]  Luke, we're going to talk to you for a full hour in the near future.
[01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:40.642]  Let me say bye to you when we end this break, and let me say goodbye to Detective John Carroll right now.
[01:31:41.062 --> 01:31:42.363]  John, we'll be watching your back.
[01:31:42.423 --> 01:31:43.023]  Watch ours.
[01:31:43.383 --> 01:31:44.283]  Thanks for coming on with us.
[01:31:44.303 --> 01:31:45.084]  Thanks for your courage.
[01:31:45.704 --> 01:31:46.084]  Thanks, buddy.
[01:31:46.604 --> 01:31:56.188]  You join publicly a lot of other great people that are standing up and fighting for truth, including former presidents of other countries, former defense ministers, you name it.
[01:31:57.754 --> 01:31:59.615]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:31:59.735 --> 01:32:04.918]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:32:05.098 --> 01:32:06.439]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:32:06.699 --> 01:32:14.884]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:32:15.104 --> 01:32:20.827]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:32:21.007 --> 01:32:22.789]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:32:22.849 --> 01:32:25.012]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:32:25.032 --> 01:32:29.377]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:32:29.557 --> 01:32:31.720]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:32:31.780 --> 01:32:39.629]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:32:40.230 --> 01:32:46.153]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:32:46.193 --> 01:32:47.954]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:33:06.690 --> 01:33:07.691]  But who is the enemy?
[01:33:08.232 --> 01:33:08.732]  Bin Laden.
[01:33:09.032 --> 01:33:10.013]  This is his MO.
[01:33:10.034 --> 01:33:11.315]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:33:11.375 --> 01:33:13.017]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:33:13.377 --> 01:33:20.144]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:33:20.544 --> 01:33:20.985]  Some U.S.
[01:33:21.025 --> 01:33:26.711]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:33:27.351 --> 01:33:30.874]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:33:31.255 --> 01:33:41.123]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:33:41.344 --> 01:33:42.084]  Fabled enemies.
[01:33:42.565 --> 01:33:49.851]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:33:50.332 --> 01:33:53.695]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[01:33:57.153 --> 01:34:00.734]  When you're out driving this holiday season, keep in mind you're being watched.
[01:34:01.034 --> 01:34:06.897]  Whether you know it or not, red light and speed cameras are everywhere ready to snap a photo of your license plate.
[01:34:07.537 --> 01:34:13.979]  One simple, harmless error could end up costing you over $500, quickly putting an end to your holiday cheer.
[01:34:14.419 --> 01:34:15.940]  Fight back with Photoblocker.
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:18.461]  Simply spray your plate once and you're done.
[01:34:19.056 --> 01:34:23.537]  Any photos of your license plate will appear overexposed, making them virtually unreadable.
[01:34:23.897 --> 01:34:27.938]  See the newscast showing just how Photoblocker works against traffic cameras.
[01:34:28.279 --> 01:34:37.301]  Christmas is here and the economy is in bad enough shape without spending hundreds of dollars in fees that can be avoided with one simple application of Photoblocker.
[01:34:37.601 --> 01:34:39.101]  Go to SprayYourPlate.com.
[01:34:39.422 --> 01:34:42.022]  That's SprayYourPlate.com or call 1-800-276-9601.
[01:34:42.042 --> 01:34:42.582]  That's 1-800-276-9601.
[01:34:49.650 --> 01:34:50.350]  9-6-0-1.
[01:34:50.751 --> 01:34:52.152]  Don't give your money to the state.
[01:34:52.652 --> 01:34:53.433]  Spray your plate.
[01:34:53.853 --> 01:34:56.416]  And when the cameras flash, you'll save some cash.
[01:34:57.196 --> 01:35:02.261]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:35:02.601 --> 01:35:04.903]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:35:11.710 --> 01:35:18.136]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, this weekend I was blown away to see this headline.
[01:35:18.856 --> 01:35:21.579]  It then made headlines all across the world.
[01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:23.721]  London Telegraph.
[01:35:25.663 --> 01:35:32.729]  General George S. Patton was assassinated to silence his criticism of Allied leaders' claims.
[01:35:33.369 --> 01:35:33.790]  New book.
[01:35:35.154 --> 01:35:53.006]  And in this article, it goes through the evidence that I read little blurbs in other books, other espionage books, other World War II guests, that we interview letters from Patton, home to family and others, his promise to have parades and go to Congress and demand that thousands of U.S.
[01:35:53.066 --> 01:36:00.191]  soldiers captured by Nazis that were then, when the Russians on the Eastern Front came into Germany and Poland, they captured these U.S.
[01:36:00.231 --> 01:36:04.494]  servicemen, Army airmen, Army Marines, and we're going to use them as slave labor
[01:36:05.214 --> 01:36:06.615]  The number's as high as 12,000.
[01:36:06.655 --> 01:36:07.915]  He got very upset about that.
[01:36:08.375 --> 01:36:09.376]  Very patriotic.
[01:36:09.476 --> 01:36:10.596]  Extremely patriotic.
[01:36:11.097 --> 01:36:13.638]  But actually did, you know, have allegiance to his troops.
[01:36:14.338 --> 01:36:20.741]  He expected a lot of them, but... And I don't claim to be... I'm some expert historian on Patton, but most people don't even read about World War II.
[01:36:20.761 --> 01:36:22.021]  I've read a few books about Patton.
[01:36:22.341 --> 01:36:28.864]  Probably read about more than 60 books total about World War II, because it's such a pivotal sea change in world society.
[01:36:30.914 --> 01:36:40.518]  But when I read this, this is what experts that we've had on over the years said about how they favorite OSS slash CIA way to kill somebody.
[01:36:40.758 --> 01:36:49.042]  They rammed his car with a truck, jumped up, shot him with a low-velocity bullet in the throat, didn't kill him, so then they sent in NKVD to kill him.
[01:36:50.582 --> 01:36:54.244]  And we knew he was saying the Russians were a threat.
[01:36:54.304 --> 01:36:58.746]  That same thing MacArthur got relieved from when the Chinese poured across
[01:37:00.811 --> 01:37:22.770]  The Yalu River there in Korea, he wanted to use nukes, and then they went to the UN and stopped the whole deal because, of course, MacArthur wasn't at that grid level, which is now totally declassified, that actually the United States put the Soviets in with money in 1917.
[01:37:24.844 --> 01:37:34.971]  Along with the Bank of England and of course in 1949, now completely declassified even on the History Channel, the CIA actually went with Mao Zedong against Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalists.
[01:37:34.991 --> 01:37:40.435]  So that was part of a larger strategic plan to create a false bipolar world.
[01:37:43.177 --> 01:37:57.241]  You know, I'm getting off the issue here and I appreciate our guest joining us, but this is an example of General George S. Patton, who was upset about a lot of things being murdered, and the London Telegraph has gone over the evidence and says they believe it's conclusive.
[01:37:58.161 --> 01:38:02.183]  The author talked to the famous OSS spy and assassin before he died.
[01:38:02.743 --> 01:38:09.945]  He also has his diary and a lot of other eyewitness reports and material, and it fits in with, it's kind of like Gulf of Tonkin.
[01:38:10.345 --> 01:38:12.526]  You know, we always knew that was staged, but now it's declassified.
[01:38:12.566 --> 01:38:13.407]  CIA admits it.
[01:38:13.867 --> 01:38:14.827]  Well, same thing here.
[01:38:14.887 --> 01:38:22.691]  So we have the expert on with us for the next 15 minutes, and I appreciate Robert K. Wilcox, author of Target Patent.
[01:38:22.711 --> 01:38:25.272]  And this is a book I will be getting, and I will be reading.
[01:38:25.572 --> 01:38:27.613]  In fact, we have an online bookstore at InfoWars.com.
[01:38:27.633 --> 01:38:32.636]  Maybe I should call a publisher and buy a few hundred and sell them on the site, because this is something people need to know.
[01:38:33.316 --> 01:38:36.918]  But again, thank you so much for coming on the show with us, Mr. Wilcox.
[01:38:37.455 --> 01:38:38.456]  Glad to be with you, Alex.
[01:38:38.856 --> 01:38:45.322]  Tell us about yourself, how you got into this as a historian, and then break down what really happened to Patton.
[01:38:45.822 --> 01:38:48.985]  Well, I'm a writer, and I'm always looking for good stories.
[01:38:51.367 --> 01:39:02.917]  My cousin owns a detective agency, and we were working out one day, and he just blurts out that he knew that Patton had been killed because he talked to the guy
[01:39:03.584 --> 01:39:05.786]  Who had a lot of information about it.
[01:39:34.255 --> 01:39:37.198]  Bazzata had lived a long life as a clandestine.
[01:39:37.878 --> 01:39:40.881]  He had stayed on after World War II.
[01:39:40.921 --> 01:39:42.562]  He had been one of the first Jetbirds.
[01:39:42.582 --> 01:39:45.085]  This was the beginning of our Special Forces.
[01:39:46.426 --> 01:39:53.252]  And had jumped in behind Nazi lines in conjunction with D-Day and had organized the Maquis.
[01:39:53.652 --> 01:39:54.553]  Sterling guy!
[01:39:54.613 --> 01:39:58.076]  And one of the things I did was go right into the National Archives and found his records.
[01:39:58.516 --> 01:40:01.319]  Luckily, they had been finally declassified.
[01:40:01.690 --> 01:40:04.272]  And this guy had won as many medals as anybody.
[01:40:04.292 --> 01:40:05.853]  He was just a terrific, terrific guy.
[01:40:06.493 --> 01:40:12.297]  But he had spent a long time as a clandestine and would have never talked to me in a million years, I'm sure.
[01:40:13.178 --> 01:40:20.182]  But he had had a stroke, and he also had been promised that he would be given a big job in the CIA.
[01:40:20.623 --> 01:40:22.704]  When he came back, of course, they didn't know who he was.
[01:40:22.744 --> 01:40:24.886]  There are never any records of anything like here.
[01:40:25.146 --> 01:40:31.490]  He had to fight to get all of his VA benefits for being stabbed, shot.
[01:40:32.105 --> 01:40:32.826]  All these other things.
[01:40:33.246 --> 01:40:36.488]  And he became very, very mad about it all.
[01:40:36.768 --> 01:40:39.030]  Yeah, that's why E. Howard Hunt went public.
[01:40:39.050 --> 01:40:44.673]  He knows that he killed his wife, blew her up, and you know, he did a deathbed confession about running the op to kill Kennedy.
[01:40:44.693 --> 01:40:46.394]  But side issue, please continue.
[01:40:46.635 --> 01:40:48.836]  Yeah, well, so that's very true.
[01:40:48.856 --> 01:40:53.839]  So all these things conversed, and I got him when he was sort of, his guard was down.
[01:40:54.059 --> 01:40:57.021]  And he just began to tell me about it.
[01:40:57.141 --> 01:41:00.764]  And while I did not think that he had been involved, I thought he just knew.
[01:41:01.334 --> 01:41:08.840]  He then told me that he had been given an order by the head of the OSS, Wild Bill Donovan, to kill Patton.
[01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:14.804]  And this, by the way, was the result of a long plot which was, we could call, stop Patton.
[01:41:15.325 --> 01:41:17.266]  And this is bonafide.
[01:41:17.286 --> 01:41:24.512]  And when you read in Target Patton, my book, you'll see that way, way back in 44 and 43, they began to not like Patton.
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:27.482]  Tremendous jealousy because he was so good.
[01:41:27.982 --> 01:41:29.644]  He was anti-communist.
[01:41:29.664 --> 01:41:30.684]  He wasn't a globalist.
[01:41:30.724 --> 01:41:31.465]  He was America.
[01:41:32.366 --> 01:41:40.992]  He had this long pedigree, closely related to George Washington and some of the famous Confederate generals.
[01:41:41.393 --> 01:41:44.215]  So he had this incredible pedigree that they didn't have.
[01:41:44.255 --> 01:41:52.862]  And we know that Eisenhower was very, very jealous of him because he was just a desk clerk and he wasn't playing ball with Uncle Joe.
[01:41:53.362 --> 01:42:00.545]  Stalin, but the key here is this assassin, and that's what the Telegraph researched your book, and they say, yeah, this guy hung out with the royal family.
[01:42:00.785 --> 01:42:05.347]  This guy was like an undercover movie star with the elite, you know, this commando.
[01:42:05.367 --> 01:42:08.809]  So, you know, he is who he says he was, and you have the government records.
[01:42:09.969 --> 01:42:18.953]  Very much so, and I became very impressed with him, not because of basically what he told me, but by going in and researching him, everything he told me was true.
[01:42:19.582 --> 01:42:23.963]  So, when we get to this point, you know, I've got to give him the benefit of the doubt when he told me about this.
[01:42:24.063 --> 01:42:30.965]  But, anyway, Patton, as you've so ably described, you know, he wanted to go to war with the Russians right then.
[01:42:31.025 --> 01:42:31.986]  He was very pre-efficient.
[01:42:32.026 --> 01:42:33.426]  He saw what was going on.
[01:42:34.006 --> 01:42:35.266]  There are so many motives.
[01:42:35.467 --> 01:42:36.607]  That's the word for Patton.
[01:42:36.627 --> 01:42:37.547]  He was prescient.
[01:42:38.347 --> 01:42:38.847]  Absolutely.
[01:42:38.887 --> 01:42:40.208]  That's the key to a good general.
[01:42:40.268 --> 01:42:40.588]  Go ahead.
[01:42:41.028 --> 01:42:47.690]  And he was fighting, basically, an administration, which started with FDR, and then, by the time this happened,
[01:42:48.143 --> 01:42:52.085]  With Truman, who was just following FDR, that loved the Russians.
[01:42:52.185 --> 01:42:53.985]  They wanted to do everything they could.
[01:42:54.105 --> 01:43:06.390]  FDR called Stalin Uncle Joe, and they were so blinded, or worse, because Stalin just wanted, as you know, to take over the Eastern Europe and use it as a buffer, and that's what he got.
[01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:09.341]  And Patton was just nuts over this.
[01:43:10.121 --> 01:43:11.022]  They thought he was nuts.
[01:43:11.082 --> 01:43:22.527]  He was so mad because he said... The looting of the jewels of the Western world as gulag slaves, and of course they mention a line, and I haven't read your book yet, a line about U.S.
[01:43:22.587 --> 01:43:23.027]  prisoners.
[01:43:23.087 --> 01:43:24.928]  I haven't read your book yet.
[01:43:25.008 --> 01:43:26.669]  Is it in there about the 11,000?
[01:43:26.929 --> 01:43:27.869]  It is in there.
[01:43:27.929 --> 01:43:30.711]  That was another thing that Patton was livid over.
[01:43:31.131 --> 01:43:33.592]  You know, once they took over those countries,
[01:43:34.065 --> 01:43:41.010]  Whatever, whoever was in there, including American soldiers, they were just chucked off to the gulag, and that is still an untold story.
[01:43:41.410 --> 01:43:43.311]  I believe you can find books about it now.
[01:44:05.046 --> 01:44:10.451]  But again, using that as PR to make him look bad, but meanwhile he actually really cared about the troops.
[01:44:10.931 --> 01:44:15.795]  Oh, he cared terribly about them, and it was worse than even what you've said.
[01:44:15.935 --> 01:44:20.359]  I mean, FDR squelched and told people that they could not talk.
[01:44:20.379 --> 01:44:21.480]  This is FDR himself.
[01:44:21.860 --> 01:44:25.043]  You know the famous Katyon massacre?
[01:44:25.103 --> 01:44:25.343]  Yes.
[01:44:25.503 --> 01:44:30.728]  Where the Russians massacred most of the Polish leadership so they could take over the country.
[01:44:31.181 --> 01:44:32.782]  And then blamed it on the Nazis.
[01:44:32.822 --> 01:44:37.886]  Well, the Russians have now admitted this in the last few years, what had really happened, that it was the Russians.
[01:44:38.306 --> 01:44:42.209]  Yeah, they dug up the bodies, and there's even Russian bayonets and bullets in them.
[01:44:42.689 --> 01:44:43.170]  Exactly.
[01:44:43.210 --> 01:44:46.032]  Well, there's no question, because the Russians have admitted it now.
[01:44:46.092 --> 01:44:49.974]  They've, you know, sort of cleansed their soul type of thing, that it was us.
[01:44:50.054 --> 01:44:59.141]  But at that time, FDR would not allow the records that he had commissioned, he had an investigation,
[01:44:59.577 --> 01:45:03.340]  To be made public because it made the Russians look bad.
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:04.681]  It was such a dirtbag.
[01:45:04.741 --> 01:45:10.465]  And from what I've read, I haven't read your book yet, the last straw though was the 12,000 troops going to death camps.
[01:45:10.908 --> 01:45:15.329]  Well, I can't confirm that, but that is the figure that I've heard, too.
[01:45:15.489 --> 01:45:18.510]  And I know that there were Americans that were taken away.
[01:45:18.530 --> 01:45:20.810]  Well, how dare Patton not want to send U.S.
[01:45:20.850 --> 01:45:23.210]  troops to Russian camps for no reason?
[01:45:23.571 --> 01:45:24.591]  He deserved to die.
[01:45:24.631 --> 01:45:25.751]  He wasn't a good American.
[01:45:25.771 --> 01:45:27.391]  And of course, that's what Wild Bill said.
[01:45:27.431 --> 01:45:29.872]  He said, he's a great patriot, but I need you to kill him.
[01:45:30.272 --> 01:45:38.113]  Yeah, this is the culmination of a series of meetings that Bozada said he had, which started with the stop, Patton.
[01:45:38.173 --> 01:45:40.474]  And it's a historical fact, we know.
[01:45:41.072 --> 01:45:56.504]  That when Patton, after he'd roared through France, he was poised in 1944, in September, to go into Germany, he would have ended that war in a month or two, and imagine all the American lives that would have been saved.
[01:45:56.864 --> 01:46:09.314]  Well, they stopped him because Eisenhower, who was a diplomat, not a fighter, not a... He got, he wanted the British to, you know, the bridge too far, Montgomery.
[01:46:10.103 --> 01:46:16.167]  And he wanted Montgomery to do this, so they stopped Patton at the German border, and they took his gas.
[01:46:16.487 --> 01:46:18.088]  This is a matter of historical record.
[01:46:18.388 --> 01:46:20.169]  Yeah, that's even in the Battle of the Bulge movie.
[01:46:20.389 --> 01:46:21.950]  And of course, that's kind of the official spin.
[01:46:21.970 --> 01:46:23.992]  They really wanted the Soviets to get half the country.
[01:46:24.652 --> 01:46:31.156]  Well, uh... At what happened afterwards... Germany, half of Germany, go ahead.
[01:46:31.176 --> 01:46:34.538]  Yeah, because Patton couldn't go in there, he had to go
[01:46:35.220 --> 01:46:42.803]  And stop the same Germans who then were able to regroup and hit us at the Battle of the Bulge, which was our worst defeat.
[01:46:42.904 --> 01:46:45.065]  We lost more guys there than we did at D-Day.
[01:46:45.205 --> 01:46:45.945]  Well, riveting.
[01:46:46.005 --> 01:46:46.485]  Stay there, sir.
[01:46:46.505 --> 01:46:49.827]  We're going to come right back to you and let you go through the book play by play here.
[01:46:49.847 --> 01:46:50.707]  I know I'm interrupting a lot.
[01:46:50.727 --> 01:46:52.528]  This is just such amazing history.
[01:46:52.588 --> 01:46:53.929]  Target Patent is the book.
[01:46:54.329 --> 01:46:54.769]  Google it.
[01:46:54.789 --> 01:46:56.350]  You can buy it at Amazon.com.
[01:46:56.370 --> 01:46:56.770]  Stay with us.
[01:46:57.662 --> 01:46:59.224]  The holiday season is here again!
[01:46:59.244 --> 01:47:02.888]  A time to appreciate our friends and family and the many blessings we have.
[01:47:03.128 --> 01:47:05.851]  It's also time to find unique gift ideas for those we love.

[01:47:09.396 --> 01:47:13.981]  A two-ounce bottle of fuel conditioner from Fuel Saver Technologies makes a great stocking stuffer.
[01:47:14.221 --> 01:47:16.303]  It's also an inexpensive and thoughtful present.
[01:47:16.523 --> 01:47:22.548]  A small squeeze of our product in the gas tank improves combustion, boosting fuel economy 10 to 20% or more.
[01:47:22.788 --> 01:47:30.354]  Completely safe for all engines, our fuel additive also reduces emissions, maintenance costs, and reduces the friction of engine moving parts.
[01:47:30.694 --> 01:47:34.477]  Each little bottle treats 100 gallons of gasoline or 50 gallons of diesel.
[01:47:34.777 --> 01:47:38.760]  With a case of 16 or 32 bottles, you'll have plenty to give as gifts!
[01:47:38.940 --> 01:47:42.142]  And the cost is only $6 per bottle with free shipping!

[01:47:57.304 --> 01:47:57.624]  Good day.
[01:47:57.764 --> 01:47:59.205]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:47:59.425 --> 01:48:00.266]  December 23rd, 2008.
[01:48:00.486 --> 01:48:01.947]  Gold opened this morning at $842.80.
[01:48:02.247 --> 01:48:06.169]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $867.82, $433.91 for the half-ounce, and $216.95 for a quarter-ounce.
[01:48:06.189 --> 01:48:06.390]  That's $867.82.
[01:48:13.032 --> 01:48:14.133]  We're good to go.
[01:48:29.671 --> 01:48:29.911]  Call 800-686-2237
[01:48:57.410 --> 01:48:59.412]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[01:48:59.552 --> 01:49:01.934]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:49:01.954 --> 01:49:04.576]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:49:04.596 --> 01:49:05.777]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:49:05.797 --> 01:49:07.418]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:49:07.498 --> 01:49:10.340]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[01:49:10.461 --> 01:49:14.043]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR.
[01:49:23.683 --> 01:49:28.477]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:49:28.557 --> 01:49:29.640]  An inside job.
[01:49:32.339 --> 01:49:33.439]  How dare you?
[01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:39.821]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:49:39.841 --> 01:49:42.462]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:49:42.542 --> 01:49:48.904]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rises.
[01:49:48.924 --> 01:49:51.785]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[01:49:52.065 --> 01:49:54.045]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:49:54.305 --> 01:49:56.786]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:49:57.461 --> 01:50:01.064]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[01:50:01.164 --> 01:50:06.769]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[01:50:06.909 --> 01:50:10.953]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[01:50:11.253 --> 01:50:13.535]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[01:50:13.715 --> 01:50:19.480]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures
[01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:20.301]  We're good to go!
[01:50:51.105 --> 01:50:54.467]  All right, this is a short segment.
[01:50:54.487 --> 01:51:06.495]  We've got a long one coming up, so I want to hurry right back to our guest, Robert K. Wilcox.
[01:51:07.336 --> 01:51:09.297]  Wilcox, author of Target Patent.
[01:51:10.698 --> 01:51:14.861]  That's right, he interviewed the Special Forces OSS assassin.
[01:51:15.856 --> 01:51:31.501]  Larry, let's go through with the start of Stop Patent, discredit him, attack him, don't let him race too fast because we've got to let the Soviets divide this in half, we've got to deal with them, kind of like the Nazis divided Poland previously in 1939.
[01:51:31.581 --> 01:51:32.341]  Continue.
[01:51:34.282 --> 01:51:40.143]  Well, that Stop Patent order came out early, and you know, it's a combination.
[01:51:40.203 --> 01:51:42.864]  He was just a guy who spoke his mind.
[01:51:42.924 --> 01:51:45.365]  He was too good for his own britches, so to speak.
[01:51:46.127 --> 01:51:48.348]  He was better than anybody else, and he proved it.
[01:51:48.428 --> 01:51:52.271]  He just roared through France, and so they stopped him right there.
[01:51:52.891 --> 01:51:59.175]  And what happened was, the Germans, who will tell you themselves, that they were in disarray and would have been defeated.
[01:51:59.904 --> 01:52:01.925]  They then were able to regroup.
[01:52:02.145 --> 01:52:09.230]  Because he was running a Blitzkrieg, similar to what the Desert Fox would do, but by holding them back, that gave them time.
[01:52:09.270 --> 01:52:09.570]  Go ahead.
[01:52:10.010 --> 01:52:15.554]  He traveled and took more ground than any commander ever in the history of the world at that time.
[01:52:15.654 --> 01:52:20.697]  His tanks were rolling, you know, four or five hundred miles in three or four days.
[01:52:20.757 --> 01:52:22.598]  Well, not three or four days, but maybe in a week.
[01:52:22.778 --> 01:52:23.919]  And it was just amazing.
[01:52:24.409 --> 01:52:26.010]  And the Germans were in disarray.
[01:52:26.070 --> 01:52:27.470]  He had pushed them out of France.
[01:52:27.790 --> 01:52:28.790]  They didn't know what to do.
[01:52:28.830 --> 01:52:29.551]  They would have been beaten.
[01:52:29.711 --> 01:52:30.391]  It was a rout.
[01:52:30.791 --> 01:52:32.232]  It was a rout, big time.
[01:52:32.472 --> 01:52:39.554]  And he couldn't believe that suddenly they're stopping him and they're giving the whole war to Montgomery, his arch-rival.
[01:52:40.754 --> 01:52:45.296]  And Montgomery blew it again, which he had done so many times.
[01:52:46.296 --> 01:52:46.736]  And the worst
[01:52:49.031 --> 01:53:12.737]  The Germans were able to mount this, get back together and mount a battle, the Battle of the Bulge, which almost kicked us out of France, but if it hadn't, but there was Patton right there, and Eisenhower, who had set this all up, just, you know, he called his generals together and said, what are we going to do?
[01:53:12.757 --> 01:53:13.317]  What are we going to do?
[01:53:13.737 --> 01:53:16.078]  They didn't know what to do, but Patton said, I know what to do.
[01:53:16.118 --> 01:53:17.198]  I'd already planned for it.
[01:53:17.586 --> 01:53:36.162]  And he turned this huge Third Army all the way up, and stopped the Battle of the Bulge, and beat the Germans there, and then was sent back into Germany, and the worst thing that ever happened to him, the day he cried, literally, was when he could not go to Berlin.
[01:53:36.622 --> 01:53:44.709]  But the Allies, our side, decided to let the Russians come in, as was all planned by Stalin.
[01:53:44.729 --> 01:53:45.790]  He had engineered all this.
[01:53:46.129 --> 01:53:51.052]  And they took Berlin and the rest of Eastern Europe, and Patton had to sit on the sidelines.
[01:53:51.152 --> 01:53:57.976]  So, that is probably, in my opinion, the biggest reason if he was killed.
[01:53:58.557 --> 01:54:07.282]  And understand, it is a mystery still to me, but I believe that I could go to a grand jury and get an indictment based on what we now know.
[01:54:08.643 --> 01:54:12.505]  Whether or not it would go to a conviction, we'd have to let that play out.
[01:54:13.021 --> 01:54:17.223]  But there's a lot more evidence here, and when you're ready, I'll just start it off.
[01:54:17.483 --> 01:54:19.744]  Yeah, let's go over what happened.
[01:54:20.105 --> 01:54:25.627]  You know, the failed assassination attempt that wounded him, and then the NKVD finishing the job.
[01:54:25.988 --> 01:54:31.570]  Yeah, as I said when I first heard about this, I, like most people, thought that he had just died in a normal accident.
[01:54:31.650 --> 01:54:35.973]  But then I studied the accident, and it is really, really mysterious.
[01:54:36.493 --> 01:54:38.674]  It's the last day before Patton is to leave.
[01:54:39.107 --> 01:54:44.991]  There have already been three or four very, very suspicious attempts on his life, in my opinion, which you'll read.
[01:54:45.692 --> 01:54:58.621]  And then here's the last day he's decided to leave the army because they have strings on him so that he can go home and he's going to fight against the Russians, which of course is anathema to the administration.
[01:54:59.081 --> 01:55:07.407]  And he's also going to tell the secrets of how the war had been badly managed and how so many Americans died when they shouldn't have, how he could have gone on and
[01:55:08.238 --> 01:55:12.641]  He's on this lonely road outside of Mannheim, Germany.
[01:55:12.721 --> 01:55:17.885]  It's December 9th, 1945, 60 years ago.
[01:55:19.306 --> 01:55:24.530]  It's just a lonely road, and there's this army truck that's been waiting for him.
[01:55:24.570 --> 01:55:30.254]  They stop at a railroad track, and then they start up.
[01:55:30.294 --> 01:55:37.499]  So they're not going very fast, and the driver, there's two other people in the car with Patton, another general who is his aide,
[01:55:37.944 --> 01:55:40.785]  ...is on the left side, Patton's on the right side in the back seat.
[01:55:40.825 --> 01:55:42.706]  They're in a Cadillac, which is a limousine.
[01:55:43.246 --> 01:55:44.687]  It's a big, it's a big thing.
[01:55:44.747 --> 01:55:45.847]  It's got a lot of leg room.
[01:55:46.148 --> 01:55:53.251]  And there's a driver there, and this driver notices this truck, which starts up when they start up after the, the, um, the railroad track.
[01:55:53.851 --> 01:56:01.274]  And it just comes up slowly, almost abreast, and then suddenly, without signaling, turns in front of Patton's car.
[01:56:01.834 --> 01:56:04.276]  Patton's driver tries to turn a little to the left.
[01:56:04.556 --> 01:56:06.196]  They hit on the right-hand side.
[01:56:06.236 --> 01:56:07.517]  It's really a fender-bender.
[01:56:08.294 --> 01:56:17.510]  But Patton ends up with a broken neck, a tremendous cut on his face, and the other two guys don't even move.
[01:56:17.551 --> 01:56:18.432]  Now this is strange.
[01:56:18.532 --> 01:56:19.394]  Why did this happen?
[01:56:19.815 --> 01:56:24.499]  How could they have a smash and two guys in the car don't get scratched?
[01:56:24.679 --> 01:56:25.680]  Stay there, stay there.
[01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:34.407]  By the way, in declassified admitted MI6 and CIA assassinations, these staged auto accidents are their favorite.
[01:56:34.988 --> 01:56:38.130]  They will kill you, put you in a car, and then smash a truck into it.
[01:56:38.691 --> 01:56:41.213]  Or they will smash a truck in it, then kill you.
[01:56:41.493 --> 01:56:42.774]  That's how they killed Diana.
[01:56:42.934 --> 01:56:44.195]  So a favorite way to kill.
[01:56:44.215 --> 01:56:45.176]  We'll be right back.
[01:56:45.516 --> 01:56:45.957]  Stay with us.
[01:56:47.526 --> 01:56:50.507]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:56:50.527 --> 01:56:54.188]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:56:57.549 --> 01:57:00.810]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:57:00.990 --> 01:57:05.051]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:57:05.231 --> 01:57:13.193]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water
[01:57:13.473 --> 01:57:16.656]  Without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[01:57:16.876 --> 01:57:27.405]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level, and germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[01:57:27.685 --> 01:57:35.691]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements, including colloidal silver, gold, and copper, with a money-back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[01:57:35.892 --> 01:57:42.517]  For four years, Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that would steal our God-given rights of healthcare
[01:57:45.663 --> 01:57:50.846]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:57:51.106 --> 01:57:52.487]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:58:06.724 --> 01:58:07.765]  But who is the enemy?
[01:58:08.265 --> 01:58:08.766]  Bin Laden.
[01:58:09.066 --> 01:58:10.047]  This is his M.O.
[01:58:10.067 --> 01:58:11.368]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:58:11.408 --> 01:58:13.050]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:58:13.430 --> 01:58:20.176]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:58:20.576 --> 01:58:21.017]  Some U.S.
[01:58:21.057 --> 01:58:26.742]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:58:27.402 --> 01:58:30.884]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:58:30.904 --> 01:58:41.150]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:58:41.370 --> 01:58:42.131]  Fabled enemies.
[01:58:42.611 --> 01:58:49.895]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:50.356 --> 01:58:53.718]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[01:58:57.583 --> 01:59:06.307]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:59:06.507 --> 01:59:11.269]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:59:11.650 --> 01:59:22.775]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:59:23.175 --> 01:59:28.719]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[01:59:28.959 --> 01:59:35.024]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:59:35.224 --> 01:59:35.864]  What about you?
[01:59:36.265 --> 01:59:42.289]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[02:00:02.557 --> 02:00:12.982]  This is the end Beautiful friend This is the end
[02:00:15.001 --> 02:00:26.692]  My only friend, the end of all these elaborate plans, the end of everything.
[02:00:32.551 --> 02:00:36.013]  All right, Robert K. Wilcox, author of Target Patents, our guest.
[02:00:36.213 --> 02:00:37.334]  Look, what we know is this.
[02:00:37.434 --> 02:00:42.017]  It's in mainline history, but there were at least 12,000, right at 12,000.
[02:00:42.597 --> 02:00:43.398]  Some estimates are above 22,000.
[02:00:43.478 --> 02:00:45.739]  Let's just say 12,000 U.S.
[02:00:46.079 --> 02:00:56.306]  troops captured in Poland, captured in Eastern Germany and other areas, captured out in the Caucasus, captured in Serbia, what's Serbia today.
[02:00:57.571 --> 02:01:00.073]  I mean, he's a lot of these highly decorated special forces and people.
[02:01:00.574 --> 02:01:01.555]  And what did they get for that?
[02:01:02.556 --> 02:01:03.977]  Ask Stalin, we love you.
[02:01:04.738 --> 02:01:05.718]  We love what you're doing.
[02:01:05.758 --> 02:01:06.799]  Our bankers love you.
[02:01:06.839 --> 02:01:08.301]  They love your new world order.
[02:01:09.062 --> 02:01:11.163]  We're going to just let you keep those guys.
[02:01:11.203 --> 02:01:11.644]  How's that sound?
[02:01:11.684 --> 02:01:12.204]  A little present.
[02:01:12.705 --> 02:01:13.946]  We'll never see their families again.
[02:01:13.986 --> 02:01:14.767]  You'll work them to death.
[02:01:15.107 --> 02:01:16.508]  Torture them to get all our secrets.
[02:01:17.009 --> 02:01:18.250]  That's okay, because we love you.
[02:01:19.369 --> 02:01:21.412]  And Patton was hopping mad about that and he died.
[02:01:22.934 --> 02:01:27.661]  So he's in the car, fender bender, but in that second of the jolt...
[02:01:28.764 --> 02:01:30.225]  That's a Secret Service favorite.
[02:01:31.025 --> 02:01:36.487]  They'll have their patsy just shoot a .22 in the air and then they grab the president and pump the round in him up against him.
[02:01:36.507 --> 02:01:39.849]  But side issue, they love distractions, they love sleight of hand.
[02:01:39.869 --> 02:01:41.549]  That's how they killed Yishak Rabin.
[02:01:41.910 --> 02:01:44.210]  They shot him in the car on the way to the hospital.
[02:01:44.250 --> 02:01:47.752]  We've interviewed the folks from the hospital, the coroner, the doctors, everybody.
[02:01:48.352 --> 02:01:55.995]  But let's continue with, okay, so this truck pulls in front and they have a small fender bender with his Cadillac.
[02:01:56.776 --> 02:01:57.476]  What happened next?
[02:01:58.510 --> 02:02:15.035]  Well, everybody speculated when the crash ends, Patton is laying on the general next to him, and he's got a bloody face, and he's got a broken neck.
[02:02:15.435 --> 02:02:17.595]  The other guys are not even fazed.
[02:02:18.396 --> 02:02:27.258]  And to jump ahead a little bit, Douglas Pizzotta, the OSS assassin, said that he shot through the window a special air-blown type
[02:02:28.041 --> 02:02:28.721]  I don't think so.
[02:02:51.946 --> 02:02:54.947]  And that that's what pushed Patton right across this guy.
[02:02:54.987 --> 02:02:58.007]  But nobody saw, in the car, what happened.
[02:02:58.047 --> 02:03:01.808]  The General, who was next to him, was looking out the left-hand window.
[02:03:02.148 --> 02:03:06.109]  Patton is looking out the right-hand window, and the driver's forward.
[02:03:06.649 --> 02:03:12.150]  And the last thing Patton says, according to a memoir which I found, is that, look at that!
[02:03:12.670 --> 02:03:14.350]  Which makes you wonder, what's he saying?
[02:03:14.390 --> 02:03:14.930]  Look at what?
[02:03:15.030 --> 02:03:15.510]  Look at what?
[02:03:15.590 --> 02:03:16.691]  At a gun pointed at him?
[02:03:16.751 --> 02:03:18.171]  At a guy shooting at him, or what?
[02:03:18.635 --> 02:03:19.836]  Then bam, the crash.
[02:03:19.957 --> 02:03:23.080]  As you said, in that instant, boom, there's the crash.
[02:03:23.701 --> 02:03:25.563]  And then he's laying on top of the General.
[02:03:25.603 --> 02:03:37.135]  Well, the General and the driver all speculated without seeing that Patton had flown through the air in the car and had hit his head on a
[02:03:40.440 --> 02:03:51.083]  You know, a post that's in between the driver... By the way, that's what they said Benazir Bhutto died from, and they released the video of her being machine-gunned, and the bullets going, they said she hit her head.
[02:03:51.823 --> 02:03:52.203]  So that's it.
[02:03:52.223 --> 02:03:58.644]  I hope nobody shoots me and I'm on TV being shot with bullets, you know, like Scarface, and they go, oh look, he hit his head!
[02:04:00.124 --> 02:04:07.266]  That's so true, and as you said, this is the major number one way to kill people, because on accident,
[02:04:07.961 --> 02:04:21.992]  Always looks like an accident, and even this bolt that he hit, that he says he hit Patton with in the face, it goes into the wreckage, and then you don't, nobody thinks anything of it, it's not a bullet, it didn't enter his body, and this kind of thing.
[02:04:22.032 --> 02:04:25.154]  So it's so heavy, a big bolt, it hits you and then snaps the neck.
[02:04:25.494 --> 02:04:26.015]  That's right.
[02:04:26.175 --> 02:04:26.955]  Concussion weapon.
[02:04:27.275 --> 02:04:34.601]  Well, that's what Bazzata said, you know, I've never done it, but that's it, and I have to take him at his word, you know, this is part of the mystery of all this.
[02:04:35.270 --> 02:04:41.914]  But anyway, so the speculation was that he had somehow hit something and broken his neck that way.
[02:04:42.315 --> 02:05:00.967]  Well, I can tell you, I had an accident investigator look at this scene, and because of the way that the car turned just before the hit, Patton would never have flown through the air the four feet in the back of the car, strictly longitudinally.
[02:05:02.010 --> 02:05:07.611]  The direction of the car when it hit would have made him hit just the window that he was looking at.
[02:05:08.271 --> 02:05:13.933]  So that is false anyway, but this is the story that has always gone down.
[02:05:14.373 --> 02:05:16.753]  And all the historians just picked it up.
[02:05:16.793 --> 02:05:20.314]  You know, they write their great books about Patton's life.
[02:05:20.694 --> 02:05:24.015]  When it comes down to how he died, do they want to spend another two years
[02:05:24.522 --> 02:05:26.203]  To investigate it like I did?
[02:05:26.343 --> 02:05:27.223]  No, and they didn't.
[02:05:27.243 --> 02:05:28.444]  Well, what about the media, though?
[02:05:28.464 --> 02:05:32.366]  I mean, I haven't seen the film in decades, but don't they have a horse cart killing him?
[02:05:32.846 --> 02:05:41.891]  Well, now, this is... I mentioned earlier, there were three or four instances that I think were attempts to kill him earlier, and that is one of them.
[02:05:41.991 --> 02:05:46.553]  In that famous film, Patton, at the end, there's a cart, and this did happen.
[02:05:47.294 --> 02:05:53.617]  He was in a Jeep, and a cart comes out of an alley that he's driving by, and it has a scythe on it.
[02:05:53.956 --> 02:05:56.017]  That's a long stick with a knife on it.
[02:05:56.657 --> 02:05:57.958]  They use it to cut wheat with.
[02:05:58.418 --> 02:06:01.420]  And this scythe just about cuts his head off, but it misses him.
[02:06:02.080 --> 02:06:06.202]  That's one of three attempts before what I'm talking about.
[02:06:06.582 --> 02:06:07.702]  Let's go over the other.
[02:06:07.742 --> 02:06:10.064]  Let's briefly go over the other attempts.
[02:06:10.084 --> 02:06:10.164]  Okay.
[02:06:10.184 --> 02:06:15.946]  The earliest was another type Jeep accident, where he has just hit in a car.
[02:06:16.907 --> 02:06:19.248]  He's in a Jeep, and he is injured a little bit.
[02:06:19.308 --> 02:06:21.669]  This happened about three months before what I'm talking about.
[02:06:22.011 --> 02:06:33.073]  But the most sensational one, and the one which is really fishy, is that right at the end of the war, Patton is flying in his Piper Cub, and he's at a very low altitude.
[02:06:33.593 --> 02:06:46.316]  And all of a sudden, five Spitfires, which are supposedly Polish, and remember the Russians have taken over Poland at this time, five Polish Spitfires see him,
[02:06:46.969 --> 02:06:54.636]  And four of them circle while one of them goes down and starts shooting at Patton's Piper Cub.
[02:06:55.176 --> 02:07:07.847]  Thank God the pilot of the Piper Cub is so good, he's able to get so low and into the hills that the Spitfire crashes.
[02:07:08.628 --> 02:07:12.211]  And this is all in Patton's diaries, and they are livid.
[02:07:12.251 --> 02:07:13.152]  What's going on here?
[02:07:13.928 --> 02:07:19.271]  That was, in my opinion, covered up by saying, oh, it was a mistake.
[02:07:19.371 --> 02:07:24.073]  He was a young guy, and he didn't realize it wasn't a Nazi airplane.
[02:07:24.453 --> 02:07:26.374]  Well, this is a little Piper Cub.
[02:07:27.075 --> 02:07:29.156]  You're not going to think this is a Nazi airplane.
[02:07:29.436 --> 02:07:33.658]  And why are these four other guys circling up there, sort of like watching?
[02:07:33.678 --> 02:07:35.379]  You know, they're the signal guys.
[02:07:35.739 --> 02:07:39.641]  So anyway, this ends in the death of the Spitfire pilot.
[02:07:40.106 --> 02:07:45.747]  And they didn't shoot him down, and I think that those three incidents were moving up.
[02:07:45.767 --> 02:07:50.348]  And so was that Soviets in the captured Polish-German Spitfires?
[02:07:50.908 --> 02:07:51.649]  You never know.
[02:07:51.789 --> 02:07:52.989]  There are no records.
[02:07:53.109 --> 02:07:55.149]  And this is a big part of the evidence here.
[02:07:55.629 --> 02:08:03.151]  Do you know that I've looked everywhere, and there are no records on the accident that I've described, on the Polish Spitfire?
[02:08:03.511 --> 02:08:04.692]  It's all gone.
[02:08:04.752 --> 02:08:06.592]  And I'm not talking about two or three
[02:08:07.356 --> 02:08:35.046]  uh... uh... reports on the accident this mysterious accident the patent had i'm talking about at least five including an investigation and possibly eight and they are all on now we know that he's in a course cover-up is is evidence of the crime generally it is a cover-up there's no question about so so we have the motive patents are saying is gonna go back and speak out against the soviets he's gonna go back and tell congress come like uh... we saw macarthur do later secrets
[02:08:35.646 --> 02:08:36.187]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:08:36.227 --> 02:08:37.207]  He's going to tell secrets.
[02:08:37.528 --> 02:08:38.849]  He knows they're helping the Soviets.
[02:08:38.889 --> 02:08:40.009]  He knows they took 12,000 U.S.
[02:08:40.370 --> 02:08:40.690]  troops.
[02:08:41.110 --> 02:08:42.351]  You know, he's going to blow the whistle.
[02:08:43.172 --> 02:08:47.275]  He's going to destroy the future presidential chances of Dwight D. Eisenhower.
[02:08:47.295 --> 02:08:48.216]  Absolutely.
[02:08:48.256 --> 02:08:49.317]  That can't be allowed.
[02:08:49.397 --> 02:08:50.818]  And the Soviets don't like him.
[02:08:51.178 --> 02:08:58.223]  You know, they want America to go quietly into the night and go along with Uncle Joe, who already killed 40-something million people by that time.
[02:08:58.644 --> 02:09:04.048]  Let's go through what they cover in the London Telegraph and then, you know, what's in your book, Target Patent, about
[02:09:04.508 --> 02:09:05.368]  You know, the collusion.
[02:09:05.949 --> 02:09:06.829]  But it doesn't kill him.
[02:09:07.109 --> 02:09:08.330]  He's alive in the hospital.
[02:09:08.670 --> 02:09:09.391]  What comes next?
[02:09:11.752 --> 02:09:14.994]  He goes to the hospital, and he's going to die.
[02:09:15.074 --> 02:09:16.314]  Everybody thinks he's going to die.
[02:09:16.374 --> 02:09:17.515]  I mean, this is a bad thing.
[02:09:17.575 --> 02:09:20.937]  He can't move from the neck down.
[02:09:21.457 --> 02:09:23.778]  But he's a tough guy, and he rallies.
[02:09:24.118 --> 02:09:29.181]  And within a week and a half, he's doing so well, there are twitches in his fingers and his legs.
[02:09:29.693 --> 02:09:36.817]  And they're going to move him, they're going to fly him back to Boston, which is no easy trip at that time, which shows you how well he had become.
[02:09:37.397 --> 02:09:42.000]  And suddenly he has a downturn, and within 14 hours he's dead.
[02:09:42.780 --> 02:09:49.263]  And Bazzara says that it was the NKVD that went in there and used a poison on him.
[02:09:50.344 --> 02:09:56.627]  The cause of death was embolism, which is sort of a blood clot going through your brain.
[02:09:56.667 --> 02:09:58.028]  Stroke, yeah.
[02:09:58.604 --> 02:10:05.607]  But there's no autopsy done on Patton, so we don't really know what happened to him.
[02:10:05.747 --> 02:10:13.631]  And recently, one of the family members of the Pattons was actually approached by a Russian who said, I want to tell you some information.
[02:10:14.291 --> 02:10:23.916]  And putting it all together, and to be real succinct about it, I think that they used a poison that mimics this, that they can do that, and they were doing both the OSS and
[02:10:24.911 --> 02:10:33.635]  The NKVD had labs where they made these kinds of poisons, which would mimic a natural cause of death.
[02:10:33.775 --> 02:10:43.499]  Now again, the NKVD was the internal apparatus for keeping control of the Soviet Union, and it was being brought into Western Europe at that time.
[02:10:43.539 --> 02:10:47.660]  Specifically, let's get into that while Bill Donovan then made a deal.
[02:10:49.021 --> 02:10:54.083]  Go specifically through what the assassin told you about this, and then continue.
[02:10:54.523 --> 02:11:01.429]  Well, even, you know, not many people know that the OSS and the NKVD were in collusion.
[02:11:01.509 --> 02:11:11.598]  They, early on in the war, Donovan flew to Russia and proposed that the two of them work together, which was a good idea at that time.
[02:11:11.658 --> 02:11:21.947]  I mean, the Russians were fighting the Nazis and, you know, Donovan is a very enigmatic man, perhaps the most enigmatic of all in World War II.
[02:11:22.495 --> 02:11:24.457]  And he was a guy who would take a chance.
[02:11:24.957 --> 02:11:26.438]  You know, he'd make a deal with the devil.
[02:11:26.498 --> 02:11:29.841]  He's the guy that flew bombers off an aircraft carrier to bomb Tokyo.
[02:11:30.161 --> 02:11:31.963]  Yeah, I think it's probably his idea.
[02:11:32.003 --> 02:11:33.124]  I'm not certain about that.
[02:11:34.505 --> 02:11:38.769]  But anyway, he went there and he made a deal with the NKVD.
[02:11:38.789 --> 02:11:48.597]  Now let me say that the NKVD just played him for a fool, because they already had so many spies in America, right up to the White House.
[02:11:49.085 --> 02:11:52.769]  We were inundated in the State Department.
[02:11:53.811 --> 02:11:57.555]  McCarthy, whatever his methods were, he didn't know the half of it.
[02:11:57.835 --> 02:12:08.848]  Well, when McCarthy was useful to set up a police state when he was just going after little pinkos, when he found out that the Army was basically running Russia, and if you really study this it sounds like you're pretty educated,
[02:12:09.429 --> 02:12:16.879]  That communism was only a fake system of the Anglo-American Empire, as the head of Georgetown Political Science, Carol Quigley, Bill Clinton's mentor said.
[02:12:17.279 --> 02:12:25.510]  They wanted to work with fascists and communists, as the Milner Group in England said about 100 years ago, what, 98 years ago, that they wanted to...
[02:12:26.411 --> 02:12:28.652]  To work with tyrannical regimes.
[02:12:29.733 --> 02:12:32.634]  And so, bottom line, that's why the U.S.
[02:12:32.654 --> 02:12:43.020]  and England put Mao in, put Lenin in, put all these people in, was, you know, kind of these fake counter-revolutions that look like they're for the people, but they really aren't.
[02:12:43.560 --> 02:12:52.325]  And so, you know, as long as he was saying it was a communist threat from Russia to take over America, that was fine, when really that's butt backwards.
[02:12:53.105 --> 02:12:59.091]  It was the globalists that we know of today who were actually finger-puppeting the Soviets.
[02:12:59.111 --> 02:12:59.512]  Go ahead.
[02:12:59.992 --> 02:13:02.414]  Well, Alex, you're really ahead of me on that one.
[02:13:02.895 --> 02:13:04.096]  You know an awful lot about that.
[02:13:04.116 --> 02:13:14.106]  But what I do know is that Venona, which was our breaking of the Russian codes during World War II, and which has been kept secret until just recently,
[02:13:14.821 --> 02:13:27.550]  Now shows us that there were many, many, many hundreds of spies in our government apparatus, Russian spies, who were telling Stalin daily what was going on.
[02:13:28.010 --> 02:13:36.376]  So, going back to the OSS collusion with the NKVD, they didn't really need it, but they went ahead with it because it served their purposes.
[02:13:37.335 --> 02:13:40.236]  And they played Donovan like a marionette.
[02:13:40.316 --> 02:13:58.921]  But again, do you see how the Western overarching Anglo-American Empire used its Soviet base as a system to send in spies that were untraceable with even the NKVD, KGB spies, in the case of the U.S., not even knowing they were under the control of the larger system?
[02:13:59.761 --> 02:14:01.062]  Well, that certainly could be true.
[02:14:01.222 --> 02:14:03.483]  I just don't know any more than what I've done here.
[02:14:03.523 --> 02:14:06.024]  Well, I mean, when McCarthy found out about it, that's when they blew him away.
[02:14:06.804 --> 02:14:08.045]  That's when they politically shut him down.
[02:14:08.385 --> 02:14:12.347]  There are probably 20 books here, you know, to detail all this.
[02:14:12.487 --> 02:14:16.128]  But all I could really talk about is Patton and what happened to him.
[02:14:16.148 --> 02:14:28.694]  And, you know, we haven't spoken about one thing, and that is that on the NKVD side, I tracked down an American agent who was with Patton's armies.
[02:14:29.352 --> 02:14:30.473]  He was a C.I.C.
[02:14:30.853 --> 02:14:36.856]  agent, a counterintelligence agency, and his job was to find these kinds of plots.
[02:14:37.356 --> 02:14:46.741]  And he was dealing with the Russians, and he found out that Stalin had put a patent on a death list, a hit list.
[02:14:47.401 --> 02:14:54.265]  And so he went back, and he tried to stop this, and he had to deal with Wild Bill Donovan.
[02:14:54.285 --> 02:14:56.066]  This is all written in this man's book.
[02:14:56.406 --> 02:14:57.627]  I did not speak to him.
[02:14:57.667 --> 02:14:58.307]  He died.
[02:14:58.772 --> 02:15:01.835]  But I found his book, which was really written for his children.
[02:15:02.296 --> 02:15:06.680]  They gave it to me, and it is an amazing, amazing document, and it talks all about this.
[02:15:07.461 --> 02:15:19.994]  And through three different sources at three different times, this agent, who had been with Patton and was in Germany at that time, as was Bozada at the time of Patton's death,
[02:15:21.046 --> 02:15:29.010]  He was run out by Donovan under threat of his life, and he had to live here that way for many years.
[02:15:29.470 --> 02:15:39.874]  He eventually came out of that and became a Republican staffer type, and he worked for Reagan and some others.
[02:15:40.315 --> 02:15:47.198]  Both Bozada and this other agent, Steven Skubik, are two great, great witnesses in this.
[02:15:48.138 --> 02:15:49.759]  They really have a lot of credibility.
[02:15:51.012 --> 02:16:03.935]  On that side, on the Russian side, Skubik found out that they had this plan, that they were working with the OSS to kill Patton, tried to stop it, and was run out of Germany under threat of his life.
[02:16:05.115 --> 02:16:06.796]  Just unbelievably amazing.
[02:16:08.736 --> 02:16:14.458]  When you were talking to the assassin, why was he telling you he was going public about this?
[02:16:15.018 --> 02:16:15.978]  Well, that's a great question.
[02:16:17.205 --> 02:16:26.213]  He never would have gone public, but as he came back, as I mentioned to you earlier, he'd been promised a great job with the CIA.
[02:16:26.293 --> 02:16:27.193]  Nobody knew him.
[02:16:27.254 --> 02:16:28.855]  He had to fight for his benefits.
[02:16:30.256 --> 02:16:31.657]  So they screwed him?
[02:16:31.998 --> 02:16:33.599]  They screwed him royally.
[02:16:34.420 --> 02:16:38.703]  And he began to see things that he had always kept quiet be put out in books.
[02:16:39.564 --> 02:16:44.348]  So he became really, really disenchanted with the whole situation.
[02:16:45.023 --> 02:16:58.747]  And so he actually did, in 1979, make a statement to the Spotlight, which was a newspaper which is no longer around.
[02:16:58.787 --> 02:17:01.108]  It was in... It's now American Free Press.
[02:17:01.408 --> 02:17:08.670]  Yes, and in that statement he said, I know who killed Patton because I was given money to do so.
[02:17:09.091 --> 02:17:11.551]  It wasn't me, but I know who did it.
[02:17:11.611 --> 02:17:13.512]  This was his first act of kind of
[02:17:14.416 --> 02:17:15.516]  I'm tired of this.
[02:17:15.776 --> 02:17:17.397]  I'm not going to sit on this any longer.
[02:17:18.117 --> 02:17:33.621]  His father, by the way, was a Presbyterian minister of great reputation in New Jersey, and he had a lot of pangs about that, living the life that he had as an assassin for many, many years for his government.
[02:17:34.381 --> 02:17:36.902]  He just had to get this out of him, and when he had the stroke,
[02:17:37.392 --> 02:17:43.295]  That finally broke down his barriers, and I came along, and he began to tell me this whole thing.
[02:17:43.455 --> 02:17:54.400]  That's right, as we prepare to go across the River Styx, a lot of people finally have that courage to tell the truth and get the wickedness off their chest.
[02:17:54.640 --> 02:17:56.001]  Will you do it before you die?
[02:17:56.021 --> 02:17:59.403]  Hello, I'm Steve Schenck.
[02:17:59.943 --> 02:18:06.086]  For the past several months, folks have constantly asked me to give them the date as to when they should be finished stocking up on food.
[02:18:06.909 --> 02:18:17.052]  We've been so beaten up by stock market banking, housing and unemployment crashes that we're desensitized and frozen inactive like the frog being unknowingly cooked in gradually increasingly hot water.
[02:18:17.533 --> 02:18:18.433]  Well, snap out of it.
[02:18:18.473 --> 02:18:19.473]  We now have a deadline.
[02:18:19.973 --> 02:18:21.474]  Joe Biden said it's going to happen.
[02:18:22.014 --> 02:18:33.298]  Former Secretary of State Colin Powell went on CBS Meet the Press and pointed to about January 22nd as the time a major international incident would force the new president to make unpopular decisions.
[02:18:33.902 --> 02:18:39.588]  Well I take the general of this word and my best advice is to have your food in your possession prior to the inauguration.
[02:18:40.049 --> 02:18:44.914]  Contact efoodsdirect.com for your supplies prior to this deadline for disaster.
[02:18:45.475 --> 02:18:49.259]  Ask yourself is it better to have too much too soon or too little too late?
[02:18:49.820 --> 02:18:51.041]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[02:18:57.139 --> 02:18:58.820]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:18:59.100 --> 02:19:02.562]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:19:02.723 --> 02:19:04.604]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:19:05.184 --> 02:19:07.906]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:19:08.226 --> 02:19:13.689]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:19:13.949 --> 02:19:17.872]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[02:19:18.192 --> 02:19:23.114]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[02:19:23.394 --> 02:19:26.155]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[02:19:49.367 --> 02:19:51.148]  Burn the info bombs to disk.

[02:19:55.271 --> 02:19:56.011]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:19:57.955 --> 02:20:00.697]  Do you take nutritional supplements but don't notice any benefit?
[02:20:01.118 --> 02:20:11.766]  The problem is, today's supplements contain things like DL-alpha-tocopherol, a synthetic form of vitamin E derived from petroleum, or ferrous thimerate, an inorganic form of iron that can actually damage your body.
[02:20:12.267 --> 02:20:16.050]  Many of today's vitamin and mineral supplements are actually stressing your liver and kidneys.
[02:20:16.410 --> 02:20:18.712]  Hi, my name is Steven Heuer, nutritionist.
[02:20:19.072 --> 02:20:26.999]  After 30 years of research and nutritional counseling, I've learned how the body works and how to work with it to bring about its healing and herculean health.
[02:20:27.549 --> 02:20:30.911]  Supplements can be a big waste of money if you're taking ineffective ones.
[02:20:31.551 --> 02:20:40.616]  So if you suffer from addictions, allergies, fatigue, depression, digestive problems, poor sleep, low libido, cancer, or any affliction, I can help.
[02:20:40.916 --> 02:20:44.117]  With my programs, people get positive results in 30 days or less.
[02:20:44.537 --> 02:20:47.319]  Call me for a free mini consultation at 888-988-3325.
[02:20:47.339 --> 02:20:48.680]  That's a free mini consultation at 888-988-3325.
[02:21:10.353 --> 02:21:11.814]  This is not America.
[02:21:13.336 --> 02:21:22.984]  Patton refused to be quiet about 12,000 US troops captured by the Soviets out of German prisoner of war camps going to slave gulags.
[02:21:24.265 --> 02:21:27.268]  Few of the men escaped and books are written about the subject.
[02:21:27.288 --> 02:21:31.411]  There's been mainstream news shows about it, but they claim the US didn't know.
[02:21:32.132 --> 02:21:34.634]  No, the US knew and could care less about those troops.
[02:21:35.274 --> 02:21:36.856]  That's how evil the government was then.
[02:21:38.251 --> 02:21:41.093]  Can you imagine how bad they are now?
[02:21:41.433 --> 02:21:47.378]  Sir, I want to have you back up for a full hour in the next few weeks after the New Year just to take calls from listeners and all the angles they're going to cover.
[02:21:47.418 --> 02:21:49.219]  I'm going to get your book, Target Patent.
[02:21:49.239 --> 02:21:54.403]  I know it's available at Amazon.com and bookstores everywhere and I hope people will get it.
[02:21:55.144 --> 02:21:57.406]  In closing, we've got about two minutes left.
[02:21:57.466 --> 02:21:58.847]  Other key points you haven't gotten to.
[02:22:02.216 --> 02:22:02.776]  Not really.
[02:22:02.816 --> 02:22:05.037]  I think we've covered... Well, yes, there is one great one.
[02:22:06.218 --> 02:22:07.038]  The fake car.
[02:22:07.599 --> 02:22:21.085]  I thought that I would go to the Patton Museum, where they have the car, they say, that Patton was injured in, and I would be able to, at last, you know, sort of see the crime scene and see what happened there.
[02:22:21.165 --> 02:22:29.109]  Well, I took an expert from Detroit on Cadillacs, specifically that Cadillac, the 1938
[02:22:30.754 --> 02:22:39.039]  Cadillac Limousine 7533 is what it's technically called, and we found out that that is not the car.
[02:22:39.259 --> 02:22:59.132]  It's a 1939 car that has been rebuilt, and the major discovery was that, you know, a VIN number, you can take a VIN even today, it's a vehicle identification number, it's soldered into the chassis, and every car has it.
[02:22:59.813 --> 02:23:03.356]  And this VIN number was scraped out.
[02:23:04.277 --> 02:23:14.106]  So there's no question that somebody wanted the museum to think that it was the real car, which they did, but it is not the real car.
[02:23:14.686 --> 02:23:15.747]  It's a 1939.
[02:23:15.928 --> 02:23:17.109]  So more evidence of cover-up.
[02:23:17.129 --> 02:23:18.650]  We're going to have to have you back.
[02:23:18.790 --> 02:23:21.132]  Do you want to fire out your specific website, Mr. Wilcox?
[02:23:21.372 --> 02:23:21.613]  Sure.
[02:23:21.653 --> 02:23:25.216]  I'm at www.robertkwilcox.com.
[02:23:27.097 --> 02:23:34.543]  That's my name, Robert K. Wilcox, but as you said, Amazon has the book, and it's something that everyone needs to read.
[02:23:34.563 --> 02:23:40.648]  All right, I want you to have a great Christmas, a great holiday, and again, I want to have you back up for an hour sometime in January.
[02:23:41.068 --> 02:23:41.949]  I'll be glad, Alex.
[02:23:41.969 --> 02:23:42.730]  Thank you very much.
[02:23:42.990 --> 02:23:43.751]  Thank you for coming on.
[02:23:43.831 --> 02:23:48.655]  Great knowledge, everything that guy said checks out with my own research, and then he expands on it for us.
[02:23:49.375 --> 02:23:51.697]  Speaking of Christmas, I'm not going to be live tomorrow.
[02:23:51.717 --> 02:23:52.498]  I may be live Friday.
[02:23:53.831 --> 02:23:56.212]  Tomorrow I'm going to be downtown serving homeless.
[02:23:57.013 --> 02:24:01.615]  There's a lot of groups doing that, but I'm going to be with my children and my wife downtown.
[02:24:01.655 --> 02:24:04.897]  I'm not saying I'm going to eat two shoes, but that's how I help the community.
[02:24:05.377 --> 02:24:10.800]  I also give money to groups feeding the homeless and helping old people, because we have to
[02:24:12.213 --> 02:24:14.834]  We have to teach our children not to be decadent.
[02:24:15.334 --> 02:24:17.395]  We have to show people how poor folks are living.
[02:24:17.855 --> 02:24:18.895]  So it's also an education.
[02:24:18.915 --> 02:24:20.396]  That's how I'm enriched by helping them.
[02:24:20.976 --> 02:24:22.356]  And it's our job to do that.
[02:24:22.397 --> 02:24:27.698]  So, you know, I know it's fun to sit around sucking your thumb watching football or baseball and thinking about yourself all day.
[02:24:27.718 --> 02:24:30.979]  But if we don't think about each other, we have no future at all.
[02:24:32.740 --> 02:24:35.801]  You should also think about yourself and get financially viable.
[02:24:35.881 --> 02:24:40.383]  And with all these made-off scammers running Wall Street, the dollar and the currency is dead.
[02:24:41.826 --> 02:24:43.508]  And Ted Anderson had a pitch for you today.
[02:24:43.528 --> 02:24:44.629]  The gold he bought at $770.
[02:24:44.910 --> 02:24:48.554]  They happened to get 50 Buffalo coins in that nobody can get.
[02:24:48.894 --> 02:24:50.256]  And there isn't even a premium on these.
[02:24:50.276 --> 02:24:51.337]  These are factored in at the $770 level.
[02:24:53.436 --> 02:24:53.836]  800-686-2237.
[02:24:55.837 --> 02:24:57.518]  British Sovereigns at 252.
[02:24:57.918 --> 02:24:58.298]  Franks at 203.
[02:24:59.018 --> 02:25:00.319]  You can't beat that deal on Franks.
[02:25:00.739 --> 02:25:03.860]  And Walking Liberty, half dollar, silver dollars, 840 apiece.
[02:25:04.201 --> 02:25:06.322]  You can't find a deal like that anywhere, folks.
[02:25:06.342 --> 02:25:07.042]  This is a great deal.
[02:25:07.082 --> 02:25:07.522]  Check it out.
[02:25:07.842 --> 02:25:09.543]  The Brokers will be there through midnight tonight.
[02:25:09.563 --> 02:25:09.723]  800-686-237.
[02:25:09.783 --> 02:25:15.866]  And it's still not too late to give a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[02:25:15.906 --> 02:25:18.467]  And yes, this show needs your financial support.

[02:25:28.594 --> 02:25:29.975]  We are out of time.
[02:25:30.275 --> 02:25:35.779]  Rebroadcast with all the informative guests we had on starts now on the web at InfoWars.com.
[02:25:35.819 --> 02:25:37.040]  And don't forget the free podcast.
[02:25:37.060 --> 02:25:37.761]  Have a great Christmas.
[02:25:37.781 --> 02:25:41.644]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:25:42.044 --> 02:25:43.965]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:25:47.426 --> 02:25:53.796]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:25:54.177 --> 02:25:55.839]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:25:56.989 --> 02:25:57.849]  Who is the enemy?
[02:25:58.349 --> 02:25:58.890]  Bin Laden.
[02:25:59.150 --> 02:26:00.170]  This is his M.O.
[02:26:00.190 --> 02:26:01.470]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:26:01.510 --> 02:26:03.171]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:26:03.511 --> 02:26:10.272]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:26:10.672 --> 02:26:11.113]  Some U.S.
[02:26:11.133 --> 02:26:16.914]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:26:17.494 --> 02:26:20.955]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
