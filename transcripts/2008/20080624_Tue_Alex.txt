[00:00:01.677 --> 00:00:04.308]  Yeah.
[00:00:12.737 --> 00:00:25.942]  Okay, Larry Pratt and Aaron Zellman this hour will be joining us to talk about the sustained attack on the most basic of rights, the right to defend yourself from the criminal rogue government, as well as the average scumbag trying to invade your home in the middle of the night.
[00:00:26.582 --> 00:00:28.823]  Our journey towards enslavement is nearing completion.
[00:00:29.303 --> 00:00:31.444]  Fourth Amendment completely overturned and abandoned.
[00:00:32.144 --> 00:00:33.365]  First Amendment annihilated.
[00:00:33.385 --> 00:00:36.966]  They're moving forward against every one of the most basic rights.
[00:00:38.168 --> 00:00:45.212]  Here in the final days of the old republic, will we be able to have it rise again like a phoenix from the ashes?
[00:00:45.993 --> 00:00:50.015]  Or will the new technocracy of dehumanization reign supreme?
[00:00:50.775 --> 00:00:53.417]  Loaded phone lines to talk to Larry Pratt coming up in the next segment.
[00:00:53.437 --> 00:00:55.218]  We'll get to all of you on the Second Amendment.
[00:00:55.798 --> 00:00:59.440]  Finishing up with a story out of the register out of the United Kingdom.
[00:01:00.041 --> 00:01:00.881]  I experienced this.
[00:01:01.322 --> 00:01:03.143]  We'd be quietly videotaping in London
[00:01:04.103 --> 00:01:09.748]  Interviewing people on the street and cops would walk over and say, get out of here, I'm going to arrest you, no cameras, no interviews.
[00:01:10.448 --> 00:01:12.169]  And I'd say, but is there a law?
[00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:14.571]  And they'd just say, I'm putting you in the database right now.
[00:01:15.292 --> 00:01:16.993]  And I learned it was a terrorist database.
[00:01:17.774 --> 00:01:20.656]  And they hire provocateurs, that's in the news today.
[00:01:20.716 --> 00:01:24.419]  Police dress up and go to rallies and start fights to get people arrested.
[00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.900]  That's all admitted, mainstream news.
[00:01:26.981 --> 00:01:29.082]  And the news kind of says, maybe that's good.
[00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:31.024]  You know, maybe that's what freedom is.
[00:01:31.644 --> 00:01:32.824]  That's kind of the whole attitude.
[00:01:33.385 --> 00:01:35.345]  Our news is like, maybe torture's good.
[00:01:36.186 --> 00:01:37.246]  Maybe all of this is okay.
[00:01:37.286 --> 00:01:38.867]  This is this great evil.
[00:01:39.827 --> 00:01:44.969]  But in D.C., in Austin, Texas, all over I have cops walk over.
[00:01:45.822 --> 00:01:49.365]  And say, turn your camera off, you're not allowed to be protesting, you're not allowed to stand on the street corner.
[00:01:50.666 --> 00:02:00.214]  But England is the worst, so they're going through where they just come up, there's no law, they just grab your film, frisk you, take it from you, doesn't matter, it says if you're mainstream press, they still do it.
[00:02:00.754 --> 00:02:08.400]  They put up all their cameras surveilling us, they watch what we're doing, they face scan us, but then we don't go out and videotape them.
[00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.743]  I mean, this is total police state, this is total East Germany.
[00:02:12.363 --> 00:02:13.184]  I mean, it's happening.
[00:02:14.912 --> 00:02:17.415]  And it goes on, Mr. Carroll requested an explanation.
[00:02:17.455 --> 00:02:19.557]  He asked whether he was obliged to hand over his film.
[00:02:19.597 --> 00:02:21.880]  In vain, every time he asked, back came the same response.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.664]  I'm taking your film, Robocop said.
[00:02:26.445 --> 00:02:31.171]  When he eventually handed over his film, he was asked to turn out his pockets and to show the other films he had on them.
[00:02:32.657 --> 00:02:41.466]  The police filed out of the ubiquitous forms, this one labeled stop and search, and went on their way on the form clearly read, in other words, seized films.
[00:02:42.027 --> 00:02:45.290]  No judge, no jury, no due process, no process.
[00:02:45.951 --> 00:02:50.536]  Just arbitrary, judge, jury, God, absolute king of earth, thug.
[00:02:52.315 --> 00:02:53.136]  What are we to make of this?
[00:02:53.176 --> 00:02:57.542]  A statement from Humberside Police reiterated that Mr. Carroll had been photographing sensitive buildings.
[00:02:58.062 --> 00:02:59.304]  And that's anywhere sensitive.
[00:02:59.965 --> 00:03:02.909]  And remarkably bullish, as they pump the country full of foreigners, by the way.
[00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:09.357]  They added that they would expect other officers within the force to act the same manner if they're given a similar situation.
[00:03:09.637 --> 00:03:10.619]  But what situation?
[00:03:13.183 --> 00:03:16.224]  And then it goes on to say, this is seriously alarming stuff.
[00:03:16.785 --> 00:03:17.885]  These stop-and-talks.
[00:03:17.905 --> 00:03:20.546]  They just stop and interrogate you and put you in a database.
[00:03:21.147 --> 00:03:22.407]  This is seriously alarming stuff.
[00:03:22.427 --> 00:03:28.970]  It's bad enough on its own, but coupled with long catalog of other incidents that have been reported recently, it begins to look like a pattern.
[00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.811]  The government's ordered this.
[00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:30.451]  What are you talking about?
[00:03:31.191 --> 00:03:34.192]  They arrested a woman for reading a newspaper.
[00:03:34.293 --> 00:03:35.793]  Stopped and reading a newspaper.
[00:03:35.833 --> 00:03:39.415]  That was in the London Telegraph last year.
[00:03:40.933 --> 00:03:49.759]  And the cops said that it had a headline about Stop the War and that people on the street weren't allowed to see a... You think I'm joking, folks.
[00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:50.380]  You can go look it up.
[00:03:51.961 --> 00:03:53.862]  That the officer didn't like that headline.
[00:03:53.902 --> 00:03:55.583]  I mean, this is... I'm God.
[00:03:55.704 --> 00:03:56.604]  This is drill camp.
[00:03:56.904 --> 00:03:57.805]  You're at West Point.
[00:03:58.105 --> 00:03:58.846]  You're a cadet.
[00:03:59.306 --> 00:03:59.646]  Shut.
[00:04:00.127 --> 00:04:00.187]  Up.
[00:04:00.447 --> 00:04:00.887]  Slave.
[00:04:01.308 --> 00:04:02.548]  You are a freshman cadet.
[00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:04.290]  I'm gonna line you up.
[00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.031]  I'm gonna tell you you've got no rights.
[00:04:06.391 --> 00:04:08.693]  I'm gonna tell you I'm arresting you for that newspaper.
[00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.733]  Cop walks by, sees a person reading a newspaper with a copy.
[00:04:13.514 --> 00:04:13.874]  You know what?
[00:04:13.894 --> 00:04:15.336]  I'm going to go ahead and arrest you.
[00:04:17.098 --> 00:04:19.261]  See, it's meant to be insane.
[00:04:19.321 --> 00:04:20.803]  It's meant to be crazy.
[00:04:21.003 --> 00:04:22.064]  So you'll accept anything.
[00:04:22.084 --> 00:04:25.628]  Like the White House writing memos saying rip children's genitals off with pliers.
[00:04:26.598 --> 00:04:27.158]  They did that!
[00:04:27.218 --> 00:04:31.361]  It's a searing of the conscience.
[00:04:31.782 --> 00:04:33.343]  It's a bathing in a tyranny.
[00:04:33.843 --> 00:04:38.606]  And then it goes through all these examples and has links to news organizations where it's happening to their people.
[00:04:39.087 --> 00:04:40.428]  And the cops steal the cameras!
[00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:47.053]  Just criminals, hardcore crooks, there to savagely bring you to submission.
[00:04:47.494 --> 00:04:51.836]  And now in Canada, they catch you without a ticket on a train, you are tasered for punishment.
[00:04:51.876 --> 00:04:52.197]  Torture.
[00:04:52.217 --> 00:05:02.383]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film.
[00:05:02.423 --> 00:05:03.203]  ...of the conscience.
[00:05:03.324 --> 00:05:05.565]  It's a, it's a bathing in a tyranny.
[00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:12.695]  And then it goes through all these examples and has links to news organizations where it's happening to their people, and the cops steal the cameras!
[00:05:13.897 --> 00:05:19.320]  Just criminals, hardcore crooks, there to savagely bring you to submission.
[00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.082]  And now in Canada, they catch you without a ticket on a train, you are tasered for punishment.
[00:05:24.122 --> 00:05:24.342]  Torture.
[00:05:24.402 --> 00:05:31.946]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut.
[00:05:32.326 --> 00:05:37.108]  An entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:05:37.548 --> 00:05:41.350]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:48.216]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:05:48.596 --> 00:05:51.799]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:59.506]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.
[00:05:59.907 --> 00:06:07.073]  Secure your copy of Loose Change Final Cut today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com while you're visiting the online video store.
[00:06:07.273 --> 00:06:07.473]  I'm good.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.660]  Hi, neighbor.
[00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.721]  They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[00:06:29.281 --> 00:06:34.002]  Certainly we'd never intend to procrastinate getting our own food supply until there was none left at any price.
[00:06:34.562 --> 00:06:39.703]  We would intend to have plenty of food so the relief organizations could care for those unable to care for themselves.
[00:06:40.303 --> 00:06:47.385]  We would intend not to be standing in the breadline with the ignorant and the foolish who pretend the facts of food disappearance are untrue.
[00:06:47.905 --> 00:06:52.806]  If the experience of the Katrina disaster is evidence, the breadline may have no bread.
[00:06:53.426 --> 00:07:00.471]  Just like the good intentions on the road to that unheavenly place, the good intentions alone to get a supply of food will not feed us.
[00:07:01.251 --> 00:07:05.674]  Only getting our food supply immediately will make us independent and fearless for the future.
[00:07:06.375 --> 00:07:06.635]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:07:06.655 --> 00:07:06.715]  800-409-5633.
[00:07:06.735 --> 00:07:07.695]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[00:07:07.735 --> 00:07:08.016]  Who am I?
[00:07:08.056 --> 00:07:08.196]  Nobody.
[00:07:08.236 --> 00:07:09.276]  Steve Schenck, Someone Who Cares.
[00:07:26.221 --> 00:07:28.523]  Do you stay up late worrying about your teen driver?
[00:07:28.823 --> 00:07:31.925]  Do you need to know the exact location of a loved one or a company vehicle?
[00:07:32.185 --> 00:07:35.888]  What can you do if your vehicle becomes one of the thousands annually targeted for theft?
[00:07:36.188 --> 00:07:44.313]  Now you can log into your own personal website and view the exact location of your vehicle, stationary or moving, in real time, 24 hours a day.
[00:07:44.554 --> 00:07:52.219]  Introducing NowTrack, a revolutionary new GPS vehicle tracking device that requires no activation fee, no monthly fee, and no contract.
[00:08:04.726 --> 00:08:10.669]  Several months ago, the Supreme Court ruled, in secret as they always do, on the meaning of the Second Amendment.
[00:08:10.689 --> 00:08:17.993]  This is a massively historical case, as big as Roe v. Wade, when it comes to a constitutional ruling.
[00:08:19.665 --> 00:08:27.927]  Monday they came out and in the past, within a day or so, they normally, when they have their meeting to announce their rulings, you then hear it.
[00:08:28.327 --> 00:08:35.689]  But now they're talking about today, tomorrow, Monday, what the White House and the Democrats have said.
[00:08:35.729 --> 00:08:37.030]  They're unified on gun control.
[00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:38.050]  To be clear,
[00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:44.924]  Is that they're for the Second Amendment, but the Second Amendment means they can ban your guns and take them from you.
[00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:46.786]  So it's lawyer speak.
[00:08:46.806 --> 00:08:49.710]  They're very good now at not fighting with us.
[00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:52.453]  They make us think we've won and stab us in the back.
[00:08:53.054 --> 00:08:54.456]  It's a corporate Delphi technique.
[00:08:54.476 --> 00:08:56.518]  They say, oh, you've got a right.
[00:08:57.259 --> 00:08:58.880]  The DC gun ban is struck down.
[00:09:00.382 --> 00:09:05.306]  They have to let people have guns through permits, but they don't have to give you a permit.
[00:09:05.866 --> 00:09:08.148]  And then a reign of terror is going to begin everywhere.
[00:09:08.188 --> 00:09:09.690]  They've tripled the size of the BATF.
[00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:10.871]  All this is happening.
[00:09:10.911 --> 00:09:14.614]  Larry Pratt, Executive Director, Gun Owners of America, GunOwners.org.
[00:09:15.515 --> 00:09:20.119]  We've never had more lawsuits, more attacks, more bullet marking rules.
[00:09:20.619 --> 00:09:22.080]  It's all happening now.
[00:09:22.761 --> 00:09:24.422]  More attacks on ammo makers.
[00:09:25.123 --> 00:09:35.069]  Gunowners.org joins us to give us his expert analysis on when we're going to hear the hearing, what he thinks is going to happen, why they're delaying it, which I think is very ominous.
[00:09:35.369 --> 00:09:36.609]  Larry Pratt, thanks for coming on.
[00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:38.651]  Alex, thank you for having me.
[00:09:38.711 --> 00:09:40.111]  I really appreciate being with you again.
[00:09:40.612 --> 00:09:41.012]  Thank you.
[00:09:41.632 --> 00:09:42.333]  Tell us what's happening.
[00:09:43.013 --> 00:09:45.835]  Well, the court has seven more decisions to go.
[00:09:45.875 --> 00:09:48.076]  They've handed down some thirty
[00:09:48.871 --> 00:09:50.432]  Twenty-some, thirty, whatever.
[00:09:51.193 --> 00:09:57.258]  And they typically do all of their handing down of decisions during the month of June.
[00:09:57.438 --> 00:10:04.384]  So that means by the calendar, they probably will get finished doing them by next Monday.
[00:10:04.464 --> 00:10:08.188]  Monday is one of the normal days they hand down decisions through the month.
[00:10:08.708 --> 00:10:09.729]  Thursday is another.
[00:10:09.889 --> 00:10:15.534]  And now we're told that they may have decisions being handed down tomorrow as well.
[00:10:16.098 --> 00:10:24.465]  So my guess is that if there's a last one, it's likely to be DC versus Heller, the DC gun ban case.
[00:10:25.206 --> 00:10:33.873]  They are no doubt faced with some political as well as internal disagreements on the court.
[00:10:35.234 --> 00:10:38.417]  It's not too much of a bit of rocket science to
[00:10:39.059 --> 00:10:48.402]  Conclude that there are going to be at least five justices for the position that there's an individual right to keep and bear arms that's protected by the Second Amendment.
[00:10:49.043 --> 00:11:06.689]  And, you know, as far as it goes, that's good because the antis have been making their argument all along that you had no individual right to keep and bear arms, that if you had a gun, it was only because you were part of the militia of the state of whatever and had nothing to do with an individual right.
[00:11:07.622 --> 00:11:14.045]  That argument is going to go out the window, almost certainly, because five judges have said they buy the individual right.
[00:11:14.445 --> 00:11:27.150]  However, the but means that the devil will be in the details, because none of them seem to be concerned about the last four words, shall not be infringed.
[00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:29.931]  And the discussion that we can
[00:11:30.723 --> 00:11:44.446]  I imagine the discussion that we heard a little bit of in the hearing, the oral argument that was presented before the Supreme Court several weeks ago, has been on how much infringement can they get away with.
[00:11:44.566 --> 00:11:47.207]  Now, Justice Stevens was the most brazen.
[00:11:47.627 --> 00:11:51.308]  He was the one that actually asked Mr. Heller's attorney
[00:11:52.042 --> 00:12:05.331]  Would you agree with the view that the last part of the amendment could be interpreted to read, shall not be unreasonably infringed?
[00:12:05.931 --> 00:12:08.893]  Unhappily, the attorney answered in the affirmative.
[00:12:09.383 --> 00:12:25.019]  And then he was asked two specific questions to nail that down and they were, would it be reasonable then to ban machine guns, another affirmative, and would it be reasonable to require licenses to buy handguns, which is something that was the
[00:12:25.655 --> 00:12:28.137]  underlying law before the D.C.
[00:12:28.197 --> 00:12:31.080]  gun ban, technically as part of the D.C.
[00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:31.420]  gun ban law.
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:36.565]  And the power to license is the power to tax and destroy, and we know that's the Chicago, New York model.
[00:12:36.585 --> 00:12:42.791]  So this is the bottom line, and I want to see if you concur exactly on this or if you want to add a caveat or an addendum.
[00:12:45.169 --> 00:13:08.857]  I have seen the policy in the last ten years, eight years, of the government switch to no longer having a frontal attack on us, because our numbers were growing, we were energized by the attack, we were taking over states and winning political battles, to a stealth mode of, you have a right to own guns, but we have a right to ban them all, basically, or make you jump through 5,000 flaming hoops and find the Bermuda Triangle
[00:13:09.537 --> 00:13:15.718]  And swim around with a mermaid with your hands tied behind your back, and then fly to Pluto, and then you can own a gun.
[00:13:15.738 --> 00:13:24.740]  And so they're going to go into that model, and so we'll actually have a Supreme Court ruling saying, yeah, you can have a license, you can be controlled, and then it's all over a reign of terror.
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:31.801]  I quite agree with that, and I would say so does the Brady campaign to stop gun violence.
[00:13:31.841 --> 00:13:37.622]  The old Handgun Control Incorporated, Paul Helmke, their present spokesman, said that
[00:13:38.144 --> 00:13:54.265]  uh... in a way we can see an advantage of losing out on the idea that we can no longer have an outright ban on guns because now that boogeyman can no longer be used by the pro-gun people uh... now we will just be talking about
[00:13:54.745 --> 00:14:00.529]  Reasonable restrictions on a right to keep and bear arms that has been established.
[00:14:00.549 --> 00:14:01.490]  Now that's key.
[00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:03.451]  Let's understand, everybody, there's no debating this.
[00:14:03.952 --> 00:14:18.602]  The pro-gun ban, the victim disarmament lobby likes this because it's one thing in their little playground of the district of criminals up there to disarm their slaves, their subjects, but now they're going to have a ruling nationwide
[00:14:20.503 --> 00:14:23.827]  That's exactly the Orwellian nature of what we're talking about.
[00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:36.914]  Truly something to behold.
[00:14:36.934 --> 00:14:42.761]  And it was something to behold to watch Justice Stevens in plain sight, recorded.
[00:14:42.881 --> 00:14:47.307]  You can still probably go to the Supreme Court website and hear the recording.
[00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:52.414]  You can almost see him taking out a copy of the Second Amendment.
[00:14:52.814 --> 00:15:05.138]  Getting a hold of those last four words, and between not and infringed, putting one of those little editorial carrots, like an open triangle, in between those last two words, and writing on top, unreasonably.
[00:15:05.158 --> 00:15:12.940]  And hey, we're all in agreement, it protects an individual right, and we will tell you how it can be exercised.
[00:15:14.201 --> 00:15:18.202]  And really the only thing that we're in doubt about, in my opinion,
[00:15:19.037 --> 00:15:27.662]  And what I can't tell you with any specificity until we've read the decision, is how much infringement do they openly declare they can get away with?
[00:15:28.462 --> 00:15:31.684]  And so I think that's the only doubt that we have.
[00:15:32.004 --> 00:15:37.407]  And frankly, once they have any infringement reserved into themselves, that's really the same.
[00:15:37.528 --> 00:15:38.708]  Well, what do you do though?
[00:15:38.728 --> 00:15:42.030]  I mean, the Supreme Court previously said blacks were only two-thirds human.
[00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:45.092]  Obviously, if the Supreme Court rules they can
[00:15:45.692 --> 00:15:47.794]  You know, cut our heads off without due process.
[00:15:47.834 --> 00:15:49.695]  It's unconstitutional.
[00:15:49.755 --> 00:15:50.736]  This is a fraud.
[00:15:50.836 --> 00:15:54.339]  What do we do when the devastating ruling comes down?
[00:15:54.639 --> 00:15:57.402]  A. Because it's going to neutralize mainline conservatives.
[00:15:57.422 --> 00:16:00.084]  They're going to think, oh, it's a victory for the Second Amendment.
[00:16:00.124 --> 00:16:01.205]  It's going to be advertised.
[00:16:01.505 --> 00:16:02.866]  So that's a sleeping gas.
[00:16:03.287 --> 00:16:08.131]  And then the states are all going to move, as well as the feds, with wanton abandon against us.
[00:16:08.551 --> 00:16:13.495]  Well, you hope there's at least one exception among the states, and that's the state of Montana.
[00:16:14.119 --> 00:16:18.981]  It's legislature passed a resolution which they brought to the attention of the Supreme Court.
[00:16:19.101 --> 00:16:23.623]  Wasn't as a formal brief, but I'm pretty sure the Supreme Court knows about it.
[00:16:24.264 --> 00:16:27.505]  It was published as a letter to the editor in the Washington Times.
[00:16:28.426 --> 00:16:42.032]  And this resolution has a lot of whereases and a number of resolves, but the one that's I think the real key is if the Supreme Court were to rule that it could infringe in any degree
[00:16:42.956 --> 00:16:54.818]  The second amendment, then that would put into question the continuing validity of the compact, read contract, the compact by which Montana joined the Union in 1889.
[00:16:55.218 --> 00:17:10.861]  Now, then there is strong words because obviously when a contract is unilaterally broken by one party, in this case the federal government, then Montana is released of any of its obligation to be part of the Union.
[00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:13.151]  And that's what they're saying.
[00:17:13.471 --> 00:17:29.301]  Now, I think I've mentioned to you before, I thought our brief was edgy because we had reminded the court that the Crown got shot at when they kept pushing and shooting at our guys, when they kept shutting down our governments and our militias.
[00:17:30.301 --> 00:17:34.564]  And so this generation is watching what the Supreme Court will do in this case.
[00:17:34.704 --> 00:17:36.145]  And that's why they do it incrementally.
[00:17:36.165 --> 00:17:38.887]  They've got to do it slow or it will become a shooting war.
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:54.030]  Well, I think they're certainly concerned about that, but what would happen if Montana was actually not fooling, which is a big if, I admit, but let's ask the question, are they sure that Montana wouldn't just say, you know what?
[00:17:54.491 --> 00:17:58.734]  You have put, not only into doubt, you busted the contract.
[00:17:58.774 --> 00:18:09.161]  What you guys just did in that June umpteenth decision, DC versus Heller, shows that you have nothing but contempt for the compact by which we entered the union.
[00:18:10.193 --> 00:18:17.355]  And this was something that was guaranteed to not be altered in that compact, and therefore you've gone and broken it.
[00:18:18.215 --> 00:18:20.276]  You know, Montana's not without recourse.
[00:18:20.316 --> 00:18:29.298]  They could sidle up with the province of Alberta, which has nearly identical dislike of being in the Commonwealth of Canada.
[00:18:30.379 --> 00:18:35.400]  And between the two states, they're sitting on tons and tons of oil.
[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:38.981]  They could certainly finance their own
[00:18:39.878 --> 00:18:43.944]  Operation and with air traffic being what it is.
[00:18:44.005 --> 00:18:46.128]  I don't think they have to worry about being landlocked.
[00:18:46.589 --> 00:18:52.980]  So this is not really all that much of an idle threat if they choose to not blink.
[00:18:53.746 --> 00:18:57.089]  Well, we've got a rogue government, Larry Pratt, and nobody can deny that.
[00:18:57.109 --> 00:19:05.517]  I want to come back with you and take some phone calls from Joe and Sandra and Charles and Bobby and others that are patiently holding.
[00:19:05.577 --> 00:19:06.197]  I want to speak with you.
[00:19:06.217 --> 00:19:08.259]  Then we've got Aaron Zellman coming on to talk about this.
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:16.226]  But for those that don't know, this is the biggest thing I've seen in the Second Amendment in my 34, 35 years on the planet.
[00:19:16.787 --> 00:19:20.090]  Larry, is this the most important, biggest, single thing you've ever seen?
[00:19:21.803 --> 00:19:22.943]  What we're about to find out, Larry?
[00:19:23.424 --> 00:19:23.944]  I think so.
[00:19:23.984 --> 00:19:29.246]  Between this and Roe v. Wade, I can't think of any two more major assaults on the Constitution.
[00:19:29.546 --> 00:19:33.687]  Been lots of them, but this is pretty brazen if they do what we think they're going to do.
[00:19:34.007 --> 00:19:37.428]  And do you agree that they're going to come out and announce it as a victory to fool everybody?
[00:19:38.189 --> 00:19:38.909]  Oh, no question.
[00:19:38.949 --> 00:19:39.149]  Why?
[00:19:39.189 --> 00:19:40.789]  We just gave you an individual right.
[00:19:40.909 --> 00:19:41.750]  Gave you, get that?
[00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:47.512]  But we can remove it if prescribed by law, which is what the EU Charter does.
[00:19:47.552 --> 00:19:48.372]  Stay with us, Larry Brad.
[00:19:52.314 --> 00:19:53.354]  I'm going to keep talking to Larry.
[00:19:53.634 --> 00:19:54.055]  Warning!
[00:19:54.235 --> 00:19:57.035]  The EPA states that... John, I'm going to keep talking to Larry.
[00:19:57.375 --> 00:19:58.236]  We're still rolling, guys.
[00:19:58.596 --> 00:20:01.036]  Hey, Larry, I'm doing a webcast for Time Constraints.
[00:20:01.076 --> 00:20:02.657]  I want to keep talking during the breaks, okay?
[00:20:02.937 --> 00:20:03.217]  Sure.
[00:20:04.017 --> 00:20:05.478]  Tell us about Gun Owners of America.
[00:20:05.518 --> 00:20:07.178]  Tell us how people can join.
[00:20:07.398 --> 00:20:08.798]  They're needed now more than ever.
[00:20:09.359 --> 00:20:10.619]  The media is more sophisticated.
[00:20:10.639 --> 00:20:13.020]  They're not letting us know that this is the final assault.
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:14.140]  How do we join?
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:14.820]  How do we support?
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:16.701]  We're at gunowners.org.
[00:20:16.781 --> 00:20:18.421]  That's the easiest way to join, and certainly
[00:20:19.093 --> 00:20:23.176]  For those on the webcast, that would be something they could do while they keep listening.
[00:20:23.636 --> 00:20:30.601]  GunOwners.org is the place where our alerts are archived and they can join, become a life member for $500.
[00:20:30.741 --> 00:20:31.902]  It's only $20 for a year.
[00:20:33.955 --> 00:20:40.482]  And this is, as you say, very important because of the growing constriction on communication.
[00:20:40.862 --> 00:20:48.610]  There's right now a backdoor effort to get at the Fairness Doctrine, without calling it that, called Broadcast Localism.
[00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:51.993]  It's a proposal by the FCC that would
[00:20:52.432 --> 00:21:01.836]  Uh, set up stakeholders, which are these Stalinist People's Tribunals that are appointed by bureaucrats who would decide whether a station's been naughty or nice.
[00:21:01.896 --> 00:21:04.778]  By the way, that really came out of the Stalinist era.
[00:21:04.798 --> 00:21:12.501]  For folks that don't know, political correctness was a term there, the stakeholder thing, and of course these little committees are just fronts for the global corporations.
[00:21:12.821 --> 00:21:16.063]  They just point at them and say, that's the NGO, they say.
[00:21:16.687 --> 00:21:41.263]  That is exactly right, and we filed comments actually belatedly because we didn't know about it until it was technically too late, but we thought it was important all the same to go on the record because we know what they're doing and this would be just as effective a way to shut down Rush Limbaugh or Larry Pratt's little show on Saturday afternoon or anybody in between that doesn't speak enough Spanish, that doesn't have enough
[00:21:41.827 --> 00:21:47.030]  Among job training possibilities on their show.
[00:21:47.290 --> 00:22:02.477]  Now, the fact that the market doesn't demand it, that people acting freely, using their money to get what they want, which is the way radio pretty much operates, that doesn't concern them because we've already identified the mentality that these folks have.
[00:22:02.838 --> 00:22:03.538]  It's Stalinist.
[00:22:03.598 --> 00:22:09.481]  No wonder they want our guns, because they're fixing on telling us exactly what it is we're going to hear, what we're going to think.
[00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:13.971]  Larry, I just can't believe how far this country's fallen.
[00:22:14.251 --> 00:22:18.032]  I mean, did you ever think you would see the Supreme Court?
[00:22:18.612 --> 00:22:23.553]  Because we know, we've already got their oral comments and the debates, and you guys were there.
[00:22:23.933 --> 00:22:29.454]  I mean, they're telling us they're going to say, we can restrict them, we can ban them, we can make you get a license.
[00:22:29.995 --> 00:22:31.715]  I mean, this is going to be hell on earth!
[00:22:32.135 --> 00:22:39.937]  It seems like we're watching the bottom fall out, that the Christian foundations that our founding fathers had given us,
[00:22:40.529 --> 00:22:47.053]  Have held firm long after we allowed erosion and corruption to enter into the foundation itself.
[00:22:47.593 --> 00:22:58.620]  But now the point seems to have been reached when it's all kind of collapsing into the middle and you can almost hear the structure coming down around our ears.
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:10.187]  It's moving very fast because when they start moving on what you're allowed to say and not say, when they can tell you how many guns, if any, you can have
[00:23:11.457 --> 00:23:17.641]  It's getting pretty far along, and they will continue the process of criminalizing politics.
[00:23:18.081 --> 00:23:21.182]  When we disagree with you on anything... Well, they're already all over the U.S.
[00:23:21.202 --> 00:23:24.664]  saying you can't videotape or be on the street while they have cameras on us.
[00:23:24.724 --> 00:23:25.985]  I mean, it's getting bad, Larry.
[00:23:26.205 --> 00:23:26.645]  Exactly.
[00:23:27.145 --> 00:23:27.906]  Gunowners.org.
[00:23:28.086 --> 00:23:31.848]  We're going to go back to the main radio show here in about 20 seconds and take some calls.
[00:23:31.908 --> 00:23:32.428]  Okay, Larry?
[00:23:32.508 --> 00:23:32.948]  Very good.
[00:23:32.968 --> 00:23:35.670]  Do you want to stay on with Aaron Zellman, or are you too busy?
[00:23:36.943 --> 00:23:39.604]  I'd be happy to stay on, although he probably doesn't need anything else.
[00:23:39.624 --> 00:23:40.625]  No, no, let's have you both together.
[00:23:40.665 --> 00:23:41.325]  That's something new.
[00:23:41.565 --> 00:23:48.928]  He's going to be on at the bottom of the hour, but here we go.
[00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:56.571]  Nobody's going to tell you this is the final battle for the Second Amendment.
[00:23:57.291 --> 00:24:00.853]  The criminals in white robes that are about as conservative as Mao Zedong
[00:24:02.172 --> 00:24:05.196]  are going to come out and say, you've got a right to have guns, we've got a right to ban them.
[00:24:05.817 --> 00:24:07.519]  Your right is to have us take them.
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.162]  Your right is to have us tax them.
[00:24:10.522 --> 00:24:12.685]  They're announcing they're going to track every internet purchase.
[00:24:13.025 --> 00:24:14.847]  The government won't even let you report on yourself.
[00:24:14.908 --> 00:24:16.509]  It'll be instantly reported to the government.
[00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:18.272]  No fourth, no fifth.
[00:24:19.052 --> 00:24:20.955]  It's total tyranny, folks.
[00:24:21.355 --> 00:24:21.776]  They are
[00:24:23.223 --> 00:24:24.063]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[00:24:24.083 --> 00:24:24.424]  Yeah, me too.
[00:24:24.444 --> 00:24:25.484]  Welcome back from your vacation.
[00:24:25.864 --> 00:24:26.865]  I hope you enjoyed it with your family.
[00:24:26.885 --> 00:24:28.966]  Well, a couple years ago a friend of mine applied for a
[00:24:53.154 --> 00:25:01.200]  Number one, again they get you used to taking licenses and then within a generation they phase out the license.
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:01.901]  But here's the deal.
[00:25:22.213 --> 00:25:26.256]  Talking about what can be done, we have to admit they're coming after our guns first.
[00:25:26.396 --> 00:25:32.440]  I've had people in gun stores in Austin come up to me and tell me I'm a liar, that Bush wasn't for the assault weapons ban.
[00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:33.000]  Larry Pratt?
[00:25:33.801 --> 00:25:39.645]  Bush said if he had it on his desk, if the Congress delivered it to the White House, he would sign it.
[00:25:41.146 --> 00:25:46.129]  That was a public statement, more than once, that his spokesman made on his behalf.
[00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:50.392]  So we knew the game in the House of Representatives, which at the time we
[00:25:50.902 --> 00:25:58.144]  Had some fairly good muscle, was to keep a vote from happening at all, and then it finally expired, as we know.
[00:25:58.304 --> 00:26:04.386]  Folks, if we have the political will, there's 160 million gun owners, probably more, we can take the country back.
[00:26:04.426 --> 00:26:05.786]  I mean, Larry, is that the true statement?
[00:26:06.026 --> 00:26:13.528]  It will stop letting the NRA sandbag us and put us to sleep, and if we realize they're a Judas goat, we can save the country.
[00:26:13.889 --> 00:26:16.369]  Yeah, we gotta stop trying to put lipstick on a pig.
[00:26:16.589 --> 00:26:18.870]  It really doesn't make the pig look any better.
[00:26:20.709 --> 00:26:21.830]  Exactly, exactly.
[00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:23.291]  So what's your solution?
[00:26:23.591 --> 00:26:25.612]  I say get mad, get aggressive, never stop.
[00:26:26.713 --> 00:26:37.799]  One of the things that's a big challenge that we need to do this year is no matter how discouraged people are about the presidential race, do not neglect to go and vote.
[00:26:37.879 --> 00:26:39.921]  We have congressional races.
[00:26:40.361 --> 00:26:45.224]  In most states we have state races at the statewide level as well as local races.
[00:26:45.882 --> 00:27:02.690]  All of those are terribly important, and if there's a landslide that sweeps in a bunch of far-left Marxists, and whatever you and I both may say about the present rascals that are in there, let's face it, what's fixing to come in the tsunami would be like moving to the Soviet Union.
[00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:09.893]  Well, that's my point, is that both parties are basically wings on the same bird of prey, and if we don't break the left-right paradigm, it's over.
[00:27:09.993 --> 00:27:10.673]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:27:11.034 --> 00:27:14.115]  I mean, Obama, hell on earth is about to be released.
[00:27:14.502 --> 00:27:27.546]  So it's important to go look for those folks that are running for office, not getting the kind of attention that obviously the presidential candidates will, who do show that they have some understanding and gumption.
[00:27:27.786 --> 00:27:31.567]  Look, Republicans need to run from George Bush and run to Ron Paul.
[00:27:31.948 --> 00:27:35.489]  They will get elected if they say, look, we are the real third party.
[00:27:35.569 --> 00:27:37.349]  We are the real patriots.
[00:27:37.709 --> 00:27:39.290]  They've got to explain that to people.
[00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:49.414]  Because conservatives, we're a conservative nation, a patriotic nation, a Bill of Rights nation, but only if it's a real party, only if it's a real candidate.
[00:27:49.755 --> 00:27:49.995]  Sure.
[00:27:50.535 --> 00:28:01.020]  In fact, the conservatives that have been active in the Republican Party often refer to themselves as the Republican wing of the Republican Party, which is a reference to the fact that there's so many of these
[00:28:01.693 --> 00:28:10.715]  Rockefeller socialist types that call themselves Republican, but have no intention whatsoever of doing anything except opposing the Republican agenda.
[00:28:10.875 --> 00:28:16.037]  Sandra in California, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:28:16.077 --> 00:28:16.597]  Thank you.
[00:28:17.217 --> 00:28:24.919]  Larry, I spoke to your secretary yesterday, because you weren't in your office, about a very disturbing email that was dated June 19th.
[00:28:25.459 --> 00:28:29.320]  It basically says, this morning, the members of the Alabama Free Militia
[00:28:29.818 --> 00:28:31.699]  We're arrested and disarmed by the ATF.
[00:28:31.719 --> 00:28:35.180]  Their arsenal will be destroyed on TV.
[00:28:36.161 --> 00:28:38.582]  All members... Oh yeah, listen, listen, listen.
[00:28:38.602 --> 00:28:45.124]  They're raiding guys that have 20 guns, calling it an arsenal now and arresting them for it in states like Indiana where it's legal.
[00:28:45.164 --> 00:28:45.704]  Larry Pratt?
[00:28:45.984 --> 00:28:47.425]  That's right out of Sarah Brady.
[00:28:47.525 --> 00:28:53.247]  She wanted to have and still would like us to have to pay a tax for having an arsenal.
[00:28:53.307 --> 00:28:57.369]  And I believe in her mind, five or seven guns was an arsenal.
[00:28:57.816 --> 00:28:59.737]  So, yeah, you're absolutely right, Alex.
[00:28:59.777 --> 00:29:01.439]  Twenty guns, oh my goodness.
[00:29:01.779 --> 00:29:04.041]  Whoever would need that many guns, as they say.
[00:29:04.301 --> 00:29:10.545]  Who would want to... Well, listen, I'm talking to a lot of veterans, famous former UT football players, you name it.
[00:29:11.346 --> 00:29:13.107]  They're not even allowed to buy guns anymore.
[00:29:13.127 --> 00:29:21.933]  A guy went to McBride's, he has no criminal record, and they said, well, the police are going to come to your house, they say you've got an arsenal, they've got a record, you've bought a bunch of guns lately.
[00:29:22.754 --> 00:29:26.617]  And you're not supposed to have them because the Veterans Disarmament Act says you can't.
[00:29:27.486 --> 00:29:28.207]  Well, that was the thing.
[00:29:28.247 --> 00:29:30.488]  They said, well, you're a veteran, so we're going to take your guns.
[00:29:31.569 --> 00:29:32.009]  Very nice.
[00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:34.151]  You fight for the country so they can take your guns.
[00:29:34.591 --> 00:29:35.432]  Anything else, Sandra?
[00:29:35.992 --> 00:29:41.176]  No, I just, I forwarded this email to Larry and I just wanted to see if he got it and if this was true.
[00:29:41.256 --> 00:29:41.537]  Okay.
[00:29:42.197 --> 00:29:43.078]  We're on the march.
[00:29:43.598 --> 00:29:44.138]  The Empire is on the way.
[00:29:44.158 --> 00:29:45.159]  Let's keep talking about Larry.
[00:29:45.179 --> 00:29:46.020]  Go ahead and get Zelman.
[00:29:47.748 --> 00:29:49.549]  Larry, I don't want to waste any time.
[00:29:49.569 --> 00:29:54.750]  We're on the PrisonPlanet.tv cast, so behind the scenes we're doing this live on the web, too, for tens of thousands.
[00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:55.670]  That's great.
[00:29:56.050 --> 00:30:00.032]  Yeah, were you familiar, because I'm seeing this, where they're raiding like a neighbor.
[00:30:00.312 --> 00:30:02.312]  I saw an Indiana case, I saw an Oklahoma case.
[00:30:02.752 --> 00:30:14.816]  They'll be playing poker next door and say, yeah, we may have a depression, buy guns and storable food, and the people think, oh, that's terrorism, because they've seen that on TV and in the sitcoms and dramas.
[00:30:16.027 --> 00:30:27.852]  In movies, where they equate survivalism, a bunch of guns, with being a terrorist, and then the cops go ahead and raid him and arrest him and say, well, he wasn't doing anything illegal, but we went ahead and took all his guns and we're not going to give them back.
[00:30:28.553 --> 00:30:43.760]  I mean, I know you're seeing those cases, and then I know people now who are veterans, or their dad was a veteran, and they have the same name, and they don't even have post-traumatic stress, and they're just saying, well, it shows you bought five guns this year.
[00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:51.184]  And yeah, I bought a bunch of new shotguns for duck hunting, and they go, well, the guy on the phone said they're going to come to your house.
[00:30:51.344 --> 00:30:53.005]  I mean, it's getting bad, Larry.
[00:30:53.585 --> 00:30:54.766]  Are you getting the same reports?
[00:30:55.086 --> 00:31:07.473]  Well, the report out of Greensburg, Kansas, for example, is very chilling, and apparently they've been doing some of the same gun confiscation door-to-door, not only that they did in New Orleans and in Greensburg,
[00:31:08.377 --> 00:31:14.959]  There's some indication that they've been doing the same thing in Iowa and perhaps other cities that get little towns that get shut down.
[00:31:14.979 --> 00:31:16.820]  I was about to say I have actual newscasts.
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:19.521]  I found them where it said they're going door-to-door and taking the guns.
[00:31:19.881 --> 00:31:25.943]  It's just out of control and these are states that still haven't passed laws that are needed.
[00:31:26.183 --> 00:31:27.724]  Utah's got the best state law.
[00:31:27.944 --> 00:31:28.844]  It's like the federal law.
[00:31:28.864 --> 00:31:34.926]  It says if one of these officers takes your gun and you're not being arrested for committing a real crime,
[00:31:35.475 --> 00:31:44.762]  Then you can sue him personally and he can't have the department... But why are the cops going in everybody's houses with pleasure and taking guns?
[00:31:44.782 --> 00:31:45.762]  They're so evil!
[00:31:46.022 --> 00:31:52.427]  Because there's no consequence and obviously if you say well it's illegal they don't care because they know that they won't be prosecuted.
[00:31:52.447 --> 00:31:54.488]  But how did they get the cops to be like this?
[00:31:55.509 --> 00:31:59.432]  Well part of the problem I think is the training that they get.
[00:31:59.872 --> 00:32:02.454]  I know that in most states when you're elected sheriff
[00:32:03.007 --> 00:32:14.491]  The first thing, by custom or by law, that you do is to go to Quantico and get a training session or two at the FBI operation.
[00:32:14.511 --> 00:32:17.152]  It was the FBI who led the gun confiscation in New Orleans!
[00:32:18.073 --> 00:32:22.194]  Along with federal marshals and the National Guard and the California Highway Patrol.
[00:32:25.329 --> 00:32:33.874]  Folks that, when they come back as sheriffs, and they think, well, gee, you know, the feds really got all these neat toys, and they really know how to do things.
[00:32:34.975 --> 00:32:36.656]  It's just, oh, it's like being in the army.
[00:32:37.076 --> 00:32:41.778]  And, of course, the thing is, there's nobody shooting back at you in this little war game.
[00:32:42.179 --> 00:32:43.720]  It's not like being in the army.
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.260]  And they're waging war against the people.
[00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:46.181]  Larry Pratt, stay there.
[00:32:46.201 --> 00:32:47.061]  We're coming back right now.
[00:32:47.101 --> 00:32:47.962]  We got Aaron Zellman.
[00:32:48.862 --> 00:32:49.483]  He's all set.
[00:32:49.503 --> 00:32:51.264]  Then Charles Bobby.
[00:32:52.695 --> 00:32:53.496]  No, Bobby.
[00:32:53.576 --> 00:33:00.562]  Charles in Louisiana, Fred in Philly, Scott in Colorado, Wilson in Florida, and then... Scott in Colorado?
[00:33:00.943 --> 00:33:02.924]  Yep, Scott in Colorado, Wilson in Florida.
[00:33:02.944 --> 00:33:03.585]  That's good, let's go.
[00:33:03.805 --> 00:33:05.727]  Okay.
[00:33:14.115 --> 00:33:15.476]  I'm just here shaking my head.
[00:33:17.981 --> 00:33:29.043]  They're up there in the flood areas, in houses that are even in dry areas, ordering evacuations, and then they go in your house and they bring cameras and they break in the door and take your guns out of your house.
[00:33:29.523 --> 00:33:30.283]  You never get them back.
[00:33:31.163 --> 00:33:35.184]  Citizens that are caught driving around the streets, they run up and aim guns at you and pull you out.
[00:33:35.524 --> 00:33:37.425]  Just any excuse to go crazy on us.
[00:33:37.905 --> 00:33:40.725]  The Supreme Court's about to rule that they can restrict our Second Amendment.
[00:33:40.765 --> 00:33:43.686]  It'll be hailed as a victory by the Wolf in Sheep's Clothing NRA.
[00:33:45.307 --> 00:33:48.271]  All over the country, they don't let you videotape or talk to people on the street.
[00:33:48.331 --> 00:33:51.315]  Cops come up and fill out reports on you videotaping.
[00:33:51.635 --> 00:33:53.057]  I mean, it's like East Germany.
[00:33:54.419 --> 00:33:55.601]  We have Larry Pratt on with us.
[00:33:55.621 --> 00:34:01.048]  We're also going to have Aaron Zellman on with us for the rest of this hour and take some of your
[00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:08.310]  Your phone calls, the police have been brainwashed that gun confiscation is good.
[00:34:08.330 --> 00:34:10.031]  They're trained by the FBI at Quantico.
[00:34:10.711 --> 00:34:11.711]  Your local police are.
[00:34:13.091 --> 00:34:19.913]  They are treating us like we're the enemy and there's no light at the end of the tunnel.
[00:34:19.973 --> 00:34:24.994]  It just gets worse and worse and worse and worse by the minute.
[00:34:26.234 --> 00:34:27.194]  Aaron Zellman
[00:34:28.573 --> 00:34:33.777]  Every time there's a disaster, the first priority is getting our guns, not giving us aid.
[00:34:34.177 --> 00:34:35.298]  This is a rogue government.
[00:34:35.338 --> 00:34:35.899]  What do we do?
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:40.442]  Well, I think the first thing you can do, Alex, is spread the word.
[00:34:40.462 --> 00:34:43.684]  I mean, more people need to know what's wrong in the country.
[00:34:45.026 --> 00:34:50.770]  More people need to know that this situation could be on their doorstep someday.
[00:34:52.011 --> 00:34:52.771]  Well, that was my other point.
[00:34:52.791 --> 00:34:56.114]  The first thing we have to do is really wake people up.
[00:34:59.375 --> 00:35:03.439]  I wanted to ask you this question too, and of Larry, and then we'll take some calls and talk about the Supreme Court ruling.
[00:35:03.759 --> 00:35:10.846]  Aaron Zellman, the Director of Preservation of Firearms Ownership, JPFO.org, links to it up on InfoWars.
[00:35:11.807 --> 00:35:14.169]  There's so many evil things, I can't pile them all on.
[00:35:14.189 --> 00:35:15.411]  I'm not overstating the case.
[00:35:15.851 --> 00:35:18.394]  As you know, from Dallas, Texas to Tucson, Arizona,
[00:35:18.874 --> 00:35:23.258]  To Denver, to Boston, to New York, to D.C., to Miami.
[00:35:23.798 --> 00:35:28.322]  The police now come and demand Oakland to come in and search for illegal guns.
[00:35:28.362 --> 00:35:33.246]  Knock and talk is where they say, let me in, I want to check your guns in areas where guns are still legal.
[00:35:33.586 --> 00:35:36.108]  Where they're restricted, like New York, they demand to come in.
[00:35:37.089 --> 00:35:44.255]  Now, in Texas, in Ohio, in Indiana, in New York, they quote, check your lock and come in.
[00:35:44.275 --> 00:35:51.381]  I mean, Aaron Zellman, don't these police know that this is classical tyranny?
[00:35:53.163 --> 00:35:59.268]  Well, they may know it, but again, you have to remember that we're no longer a nation that has peace officers.
[00:35:59.328 --> 00:36:02.671]  We're now a nation that has law enforcement officers.
[00:36:04.986 --> 00:36:10.988]  I'm not concerned about keeping the peace as much as they are about enforcing any law they're ordered to enforce.
[00:36:12.548 --> 00:36:15.809]  So tyranny is something that really means very little to them.
[00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:22.171]  And it will simply tell you, we're just doing our job.
[00:36:24.372 --> 00:36:25.733]  And that's their attitude.
[00:36:25.833 --> 00:36:28.793]  Which we've heard before, that just doing our job.
[00:36:28.813 --> 00:36:33.555]  That went down in Nuremberg, where Nazis kept saying, we're just doing our job, just following orders.
[00:36:34.443 --> 00:36:38.545]  And that's what a lot of police officers are doing today, just following orders.
[00:36:39.466 --> 00:36:41.647]  So, you don't have to look too far to find an enemy.
[00:36:41.707 --> 00:36:49.571]  Well, I think it's a cop-out with many when they say, oh, I'm just going to shoot them when they come for my guns, and then they do, and you get SWAT teamed, and that's the end of it.
[00:36:50.191 --> 00:36:59.516]  But, I mean, it's not a cop-out when Larry Pratt puts that in a brief to the Supreme Court that it's going to lead to a shooting war, and I think it really is going to lead to that.
[00:37:02.307 --> 00:37:04.428]  Your comments on that, Aaron Selman, and then Larry Pratt.
[00:37:05.948 --> 00:37:19.753]  Well, I noticed in a brief that we submitted to the Supreme Court, which is on the front page of our website, JPFO.org, we made it very clear that an armed citizen re-existed to defend itself against the government-gone-bad tyranny.
[00:37:20.913 --> 00:37:31.197]  And I'm suspecting, this is speculation of course, but tomorrow or Thursday, when we assume we're going to hear Supremes are going to come down from the mountaintop and pronounce what they think,
[00:37:32.188 --> 00:37:32.248]  I'm
[00:38:02.822 --> 00:38:16.133]  And I think that we are going to see this week, unless I am really surprised and shocked to the extreme, that the battle is going to start now, the battle in real earnest.
[00:38:16.353 --> 00:38:16.954]  This is it.
[00:38:16.994 --> 00:38:21.938]  By the gun haters, by the state, to destroy gun ownership in America.
[00:38:22.018 --> 00:38:22.698]  Yeah, this is it.
[00:38:22.758 --> 00:38:24.700]  I tell you, just one more thing before I forget.
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:32.226]  This is really a double-edged sword, because if they say, well, okay, reasonable regulation is okay for the Second Amendment, which is a right,
[00:38:32.918 --> 00:38:35.299]  And of course the door is wide open for all other rights.
[00:38:35.899 --> 00:38:37.500]  Oh, that is so key.
[00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:40.641]  And they are attacking the Fourth Amendment, the First Amendment.
[00:38:41.061 --> 00:38:44.422]  Larry Pratt comments on that key point that Aaron Zellman just made.
[00:38:45.102 --> 00:38:54.165]  I think he puts it very well, that the only thing we don't know is how much infringement do they think they can infringe and get away with it.
[00:38:54.445 --> 00:39:00.087]  My guess is they're going to assume that they can get away with quite a bit because they've been educating us
[00:39:00.728 --> 00:39:09.811]  To accept the notion that anything the government says, anything, is the law because, quote, the government is the sovereign, which is exactly wrong.
[00:39:10.151 --> 00:39:11.191]  The people are the sovereign.
[00:39:11.231 --> 00:39:13.312]  We tell the government what to do.
[00:39:14.032 --> 00:39:19.773]  That's why we have a Constitution that tells them the few things they can do and all the other things that they cannot do.
[00:39:20.434 --> 00:39:28.936]  And you can look in vain in the Constitution to see any place for the regulation of guns, and you just aren't going to find it.
[00:39:29.629 --> 00:39:35.557]  But they're going to find it because they're going to operate under the notion that they are the Constitution.
[00:39:35.918 --> 00:39:40.244]  That every time they meet, there's a constitutional convention taking place.
[00:39:40.888 --> 00:39:45.869]  And aren't we lucky that we have a Constitution that can keep up with the times.
[00:39:45.969 --> 00:39:47.389]  What about the militia question?
[00:39:47.409 --> 00:39:49.430]  They're also going to rule on that.
[00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:52.091]  We didn't have a National Guard until after 1900.
[00:39:52.671 --> 00:40:01.513]  All the Federalist Papers, all the debates say it's the independent citizens and that it's there to defend against a central government, mainly criminals secondarily.
[00:40:01.533 --> 00:40:06.654]  That was the opinion of Judge Lawrence Silberman at the D.C.
[00:40:06.694 --> 00:40:07.434]  Court of Appeals.
[00:40:08.127 --> 00:40:12.830]  His was an excellent decision, and he did a very good job on this concept of militia.
[00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:21.414]  But again, I think if you assume that you can infringe, then, hey, if you've got an individual right, but we can infringe it, what does that really mean?
[00:40:21.775 --> 00:40:27.838]  Well, it means whatever we might believe before breakfast, and as Humpty Dumpty said, I can believe eight different things!
[00:40:27.998 --> 00:40:29.319]  Well, I want to point something out here.
[00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:31.731]  This isn't a joke, folks.
[00:40:32.252 --> 00:40:34.514]  They aren't just going to take the guns and be friendly.
[00:40:34.554 --> 00:40:36.536]  They want this because they're going to rape the hell out of us.
[00:40:37.156 --> 00:40:39.799]  And you can make no mistake, this government is mad dog evil.
[00:40:40.079 --> 00:40:42.021]  It isn't about George Bush or Barack Obama.
[00:40:42.061 --> 00:40:49.648]  It's all run by the same global corporate interests that want to be able to loot this nation of its capital, for its young men and women, for the military.
[00:40:49.928 --> 00:40:51.090]  They want full control.
[00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:52.791]  They're not backing off.
[00:40:52.831 --> 00:40:55.193]  And Aaron Zellman, I want to ask you both this, then we're going to take calls.
[00:40:56.254 --> 00:40:58.736]  This country started over them coming to take the guns.
[00:40:58.856 --> 00:40:59.377]  That was it.
[00:40:59.737 --> 00:41:07.383]  The raping the daughters, the taxes, the stealing, the guys in red coats beating people up and swaggering and being arrogant.
[00:41:08.383 --> 00:41:14.807]  Well, you may be right on that, Alex, and as you know, I want to remind people of something I've been telling folks for years on your show.
[00:41:38.519 --> 00:41:41.942]  Simply put, master of the art of long-range rifle shooting.
[00:41:42.722 --> 00:41:45.765]  And we'll let someone else peel the onion on that.
[00:41:46.525 --> 00:41:47.046]  But you're right.
[00:41:47.086 --> 00:41:52.890]  In other words, the government is hell-bent to have all the power.
[00:41:54.071 --> 00:42:07.161]  And I will tell people, if they're able to obtain complete ownership of firearms, so the American people are disarmed, you will see a draft come about, drafting people for foreign wars and adventures.
[00:42:07.711 --> 00:42:09.453]  The likes of which you can't even imagine.
[00:42:10.774 --> 00:42:17.519]  So there's a lot of serious issues that are about to explode in this country if the American people are disarmed.
[00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:19.141]  Yeah, tyranny's on the move.
[00:42:19.181 --> 00:42:19.701]  Larry Pratt?
[00:42:20.102 --> 00:42:35.875]  Well, Alex, I guess there's at least one difference between the Revolutionary War era picture that you've just painted and today, and that is that those who are working to take over our freedoms today don't wear red coats.
[00:42:37.262 --> 00:42:42.466]  Exactly, but I mean, how can the BATF, how can the police not know they're in the wrong?
[00:42:43.527 --> 00:42:48.771]  Well, to a certain extent, I think because the law of God's written on all of our hearts, they know that.
[00:42:48.912 --> 00:42:55.537]  But secondarily, there's a lot of willful denial and there's a lot of educated ignorance.
[00:42:56.247 --> 00:43:05.011]  They're going through schools that are telling them that the government is sovereign, and we've got people coming out of schools that can't wait to vote away their freedoms.
[00:43:05.031 --> 00:43:11.574]  That's what the Founders kept saying, is that don't try to invent, don't try to twist what lawyers speak, what this says.
[00:43:11.614 --> 00:43:15.516]  It's very clear, it's to defend against government tyranny, it's an absolute individual right.
[00:43:15.816 --> 00:43:18.397]  I mean, how can the Supreme Court ignore what the Founders said?
[00:43:18.597 --> 00:43:25.340]  The Founders said, anybody who tries to put a lien on this, tries to infringe on this, wage war against them, kill them!
[00:43:26.311 --> 00:43:33.500]  Well, they feel that they can get away with it, and frankly, they have been getting away with it for a long, long time.
[00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:36.624]  They treat the Constitution with utter contempt
[00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:40.871]  Properly understood, they are under the Constitution.
[00:43:41.312 --> 00:43:44.173]  As they understand it, they are the Constitution.
[00:43:44.193 --> 00:43:48.695]  Well, we're going to beat them this way, and I'm going to tell all the listeners this, and I want to get both your take on this, and we will take calls.
[00:43:48.735 --> 00:43:59.719]  Go to GunOwnersOfAmerica.org, JPFO.org, join both groups, buy their books or videos, educate everybody, put them on AXS TV, get the word out, have local groups, because this is life and death.
[00:44:00.239 --> 00:44:03.041]  Take two or three neighbors out a year, bare minimum.
[00:44:03.241 --> 00:44:04.102]  Teach them how to shoot.
[00:44:04.162 --> 00:44:05.743]  Teach them the love of that.
[00:44:05.783 --> 00:44:06.803]  Then get them to be activists.
[00:44:07.124 --> 00:44:08.485]  That's why I think we're going to win.
[00:44:08.545 --> 00:44:11.507]  Because I've seen an awakening, a love of the Second Amendment.
[00:44:12.147 --> 00:44:14.909]  All the liberals I know in Austin have woken up.
[00:44:14.969 --> 00:44:16.270]  They hate both parties now.
[00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:17.611]  They're buying guns.
[00:44:17.671 --> 00:44:18.891]  I mean, for five, six years.
[00:44:19.412 --> 00:44:21.433]  Are you not seeing Aaron Zellman and Larry Pratt?
[00:44:21.773 --> 00:44:24.115]  A huge awakening to government tyranny.
[00:44:24.555 --> 00:44:30.039]  And now liberals, I mean grassroots, not the big ones, are now converting to freedom.
[00:44:31.139 --> 00:44:32.840]  Well, if I can go first on this, Larry.
[00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:50.867]  What I see is a grassroots awakening, not just for Second Amendment issues, but the war on drugs, the Internal Revenue Service, OSHA, all of these government agencies that are dead, that really are a bunch of jackbooted thugs, to put it simply.
[00:44:51.507 --> 00:44:55.749]  And so it is their kind of tyranny that is awakening millions and millions of people.
[00:44:57.761 --> 00:45:00.763]  Many people have to realize you can't just man the barricades.
[00:45:00.803 --> 00:45:05.046]  You've got to be in a situation where you're not going nose-to-nose with evil.
[00:45:06.066 --> 00:45:11.030]  Because evil will be better armed and equipped with your tax dollars, by the way.
[00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:16.673]  However, the American people are financing their own destruction through the tax system.
[00:45:18.074 --> 00:45:24.178]  One of the hopeful signs that I've seen at Gun Owners of America is, well, to give you an example, I went out to speak to a local university
[00:45:25.177 --> 00:45:35.282]  And among the students who were there, and there were a number of students, there were several of them who were already members of Gun Owners of America.
[00:45:35.762 --> 00:45:41.065]  So we're not just dealing with people in their 60s, 70s, and 80s.
[00:45:41.205 --> 00:45:42.466]  We have members of that age.
[00:45:42.966 --> 00:45:48.149]  But I'm quite aware of a large number, and I believe it's a growing number, of
[00:45:49.133 --> 00:45:52.494]  Very young people who, just like Aaron said, they get it.
[00:45:52.754 --> 00:46:02.257]  Well, I know that when my grandfathers went to World War II, they were told things in boot camp and given manuals about, you're going because the Nazis want to take your property rights, your free speech, and your guns.
[00:46:02.617 --> 00:46:05.458]  Or, we're fighting the Soviets because they want your free speech and your guns.
[00:46:05.998 --> 00:46:07.878]  And then now the government's attacking all that.
[00:46:07.978 --> 00:46:09.139]  They are the bad guys.
[00:46:09.419 --> 00:46:09.899]  Period!
[00:46:11.129 --> 00:46:19.216]  They've gotten their role just a little bit confused, but then, after all, they've been allowed to think that they are the sovereigns for a long time.
[00:46:19.976 --> 00:46:21.778]  Not too surprising that they act this way.
[00:46:21.798 --> 00:46:21.998]  Absolutely.
[00:46:22.018 --> 00:46:22.839]  Let's take some calls.
[00:46:22.919 --> 00:46:23.880]  Charles in Louisiana.
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:30.665]  You're on the air with Aaron Zellman of Jews in Preservation of Firearms Ownership, and Larry Pratt, two of the best fighters for the Second Amendment out there.
[00:46:31.486 --> 00:46:33.628]  Well, you know, how you been doing, Mr. Jones?
[00:46:34.845 --> 00:46:44.994]  Mr. Pratt, I was in gun confiscation in New Orleans, and when I seen in New Orleans, I seen one old woman come up to the door with a gun and a knife and they arrested her.
[00:46:45.594 --> 00:46:47.816]  And that's the only resistance New Orleans had.
[00:46:48.517 --> 00:46:52.080]  It was so terrible, now I was mad, but now I laugh at the people.
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:54.862]  They're so, they toast.
[00:46:55.022 --> 00:46:56.063]  American people are toast.
[00:46:56.464 --> 00:46:57.545]  You can't make them fight.
[00:46:57.565 --> 00:46:59.106]  They don't believe in nothing.
[00:46:59.546 --> 00:47:01.308]  All they want is football games and drugs.
[00:47:01.966 --> 00:47:03.887]  I don't believe the American people will ever fight.
[00:47:04.007 --> 00:47:09.909]  I think they finished, and they know they finished, because we have let this government make us domestic cowards.
[00:47:10.429 --> 00:47:26.375]  Well, that's certainly been the hope and the policy I would submit, especially the schools, certainly the entertainment industry, and the government supports that notion very handsomely, but I don't know that they've necessarily succeeded yet.
[00:47:26.795 --> 00:47:28.076]  I think we'd be foolish to
[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:32.981]  To deny that what you've just described is a real big problem.
[00:47:47.845 --> 00:47:48.605]  And we've got more than 5%.
[00:47:48.665 --> 00:47:50.566]  We've still got a lot of good people.
[00:47:50.586 --> 00:47:51.907]  We've got good people in government.
[00:47:52.367 --> 00:47:55.709]  I mean, look, 75% of the Republican donations were to Ron Paul.
[00:47:56.069 --> 00:47:57.950]  And I'm telling you, I'm not being a cheerleader here.
[00:47:58.370 --> 00:48:00.911]  I'm seeing an explosive awakening.
[00:48:01.011 --> 00:48:02.912]  That's why the government's moving against us.
[00:48:02.992 --> 00:48:03.572]  Aaron Zellman?
[00:48:04.813 --> 00:48:07.134]  Well, I think you have a point there, Alex.
[00:48:07.414 --> 00:48:11.356]  Before I forget, you were mentioning about World War II and the films they showed people.
[00:48:12.076 --> 00:48:17.139]  If people have a chance to get a hold of a series of films called Why We Fight, which was
[00:48:18.297 --> 00:48:20.157]  Uh, created during World War II.
[00:48:20.997 --> 00:48:26.638]  Uh, it helps people better understand why the people should fight to preserve American values.
[00:48:27.639 --> 00:48:31.179]  And these films were shown to the American people and, of course, the people in the military.
[00:48:31.979 --> 00:48:37.840]  And it, uh, it created a demand, a groundswell in America to preserve freedom.
[00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:47.502]  And so if you have a chance to get a hold of these films called Why We Fight, uh, most of them, they're very, they're very cheap, they're available, and some of them may even be on YouTube.
[00:48:48.547 --> 00:48:53.209]  At any rate, to go to your next question, I think that there may be an awakening out there.
[00:48:53.229 --> 00:48:54.629]  I don't see that that much.
[00:48:55.450 --> 00:49:00.192]  I think there may be an awakening by some people, but I don't see a lot of gun owners waking up.
[00:49:01.252 --> 00:49:05.214]  I see a lot of gun owners still thinking, well, things are going to be okay.
[00:49:05.254 --> 00:49:06.194]  They couldn't do this.
[00:49:06.234 --> 00:49:07.255]  It couldn't happen here.
[00:49:07.715 --> 00:49:10.476]  They're not going to take my shotgun and all the rest of that nonsense.
[00:49:11.736 --> 00:49:18.319]  And finally, I know that I want to make sure that everyone understands Larry's not joining in with me when I say this.
[00:49:18.803 --> 00:49:26.627]  But I've got a real gripe with the National Rifle Association, because they still do not want to abolish the ATF.
[00:49:26.748 --> 00:49:37.173]  They had the chance many years ago, they took a pass on it, and because of their compromising today, they're innocent gun owners, like Dave Oleson, going to prison.
[00:49:37.213 --> 00:49:40.956]  Well, Aaron Zellman, I don't want to disagree with you, but it's not compromise.
[00:49:40.996 --> 00:49:43.597]  Compromise is if they give up something and we give up something.
[00:49:44.257 --> 00:49:46.699]  We always give in and they always push us over the cliff.
[00:49:48.021 --> 00:49:49.302]  I'm afraid that's accurate.
[00:49:49.963 --> 00:49:51.384]  I'll accept that.
[00:49:51.424 --> 00:49:52.525]  It's not compromising.
[00:49:53.146 --> 00:49:54.587]  It's Benedict Arnold behavior.
[00:49:54.867 --> 00:50:07.919]  But Alex, I think your point that you made a minute ago needs to be kept in mind because we can easily focus on the enormous number of bad things that are happening and forget that it looked at least that grim.
[00:50:07.979 --> 00:50:10.802]  When the men signed the Declaration of Independence,
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:15.624]  They had a kind of scaffold humor as they were signing it, joking with each other.
[00:50:16.005 --> 00:50:18.027]  Well, I'm signing my death certificate.
[00:50:18.908 --> 00:50:21.591]  They knew that... Well, that's what signinger John Hancock meant.
[00:50:21.611 --> 00:50:23.593]  He said, they said, you know, we're going to get killed for this.
[00:50:23.633 --> 00:50:24.354]  He said, well, good.
[00:50:24.614 --> 00:50:25.715]  Let my name be the biggest.
[00:50:25.735 --> 00:50:26.035]  Go ahead.
[00:50:26.055 --> 00:50:26.436]  Sorry, Larry.
[00:50:27.182 --> 00:50:30.525]  The point is, majorities don't make history, it's minorities that do.
[00:50:30.846 --> 00:50:32.127]  They were what, 56 men?
[00:50:32.508 --> 00:50:33.729]  Well, I'm going to say this right now.
[00:50:34.149 --> 00:50:36.332]  I don't want to die, but I am ready to die for this.
[00:50:36.432 --> 00:50:38.915]  And I am not backing down, and I'm not stopping.
[00:50:39.195 --> 00:50:41.418]  I'm going to talk during the break with both of you for the internet cast.
[00:50:41.438 --> 00:50:44.181]  We're going to continue to take calls on the main side of the main radio program.
[00:50:44.441 --> 00:50:44.862]  Stay with us.
[00:50:48.692 --> 00:50:50.674]  Okay, going back to Larry Pratt and Aaron Zellman.
[00:50:51.915 --> 00:50:53.135]  Yeah, we're all on the same page.
[00:50:53.175 --> 00:50:53.956]  It's going to be horrible.
[00:50:54.196 --> 00:50:55.677]  When is this ruling going to come out?
[00:50:55.777 --> 00:50:57.559]  Normally they do it within a day or so.
[00:50:58.379 --> 00:51:00.481]  Is that more ominous that they haven't announced yet?
[00:51:01.121 --> 00:51:04.784]  Well, it's either going to be today or Thursday, as I understand.
[00:51:05.685 --> 00:51:07.266]  And it could be two different reasons.
[00:51:09.096 --> 00:51:14.401]  They're going to do something that will be so controversial, they want to be out of town, so they're not going to be reachable.
[00:51:14.701 --> 00:51:18.204]  Or they're planning a state shooting, to coincide with it.
[00:51:18.804 --> 00:51:19.685]  Well, it could be.
[00:51:20.005 --> 00:51:21.446]  Anything's possible.
[00:51:22.187 --> 00:51:29.013]  We are dealing with the federal government, who has proven not to be our friend, for the most part.
[00:51:29.413 --> 00:51:37.940]  It's really hard to second guess why they're taking so long to do this, other than, as I have joked, they may have a Hollywood agent who's telling them,
[00:51:41.704 --> 00:51:49.601]  Well, our attorneys had indicated they thought it more likely than not that this would be one of the, if not the, last decision
[00:51:50.216 --> 00:51:53.119]  Handed down, which means even perhaps next Monday.
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:52:10.495]  But part of the reason is simply that they know this is a really big one, and unlike even the abortion decision where the dead babies can't shoot back, there is the risk that a place like Montana might just
[00:52:11.069 --> 00:52:15.832]  Go ballistic, you know, and say we're not going to play this game anymore.
[00:52:15.932 --> 00:52:19.774]  I think we need to call for the states to secede and reform the union if this happens.
[00:52:19.814 --> 00:52:20.334]  I'm not kidding.
[00:52:20.374 --> 00:52:22.215]  I mean, we need to get serious.
[00:52:22.636 --> 00:52:28.399]  I think the key here is to let everybody know that when they trumpet this is a victory for the Second Amendment, that that is a cruel hoax.
[00:52:28.979 --> 00:52:33.202]  And then I think it's time to really call for impeachment of the Supreme Court.
[00:52:34.322 --> 00:52:35.523]  Larry, Aaron, what do you think?
[00:52:36.464 --> 00:52:40.346]  Well, impeachment of the Supreme Court would be something long overdue.
[00:52:41.148 --> 00:52:42.570]  Along with a lot of the other judges.
[00:52:43.371 --> 00:52:59.049]  Something that would be legislatively at least conceivable would be legislation stripping their authority in huge areas where the Constitution doesn't give them the authority and just pull out these cases so they never even get into federal court to begin with.
[00:53:00.151 --> 00:53:00.732]  That can be done.
[00:53:00.752 --> 00:53:04.234]  Yeah, then you've got the danger of the other tyrannies rising and the other agencies.
[00:53:04.715 --> 00:53:07.537]  Well, Alex, if I can just address that for a moment, if we have a moment.
[00:53:07.557 --> 00:53:07.957]  Yeah, go ahead.
[00:53:08.538 --> 00:53:18.746]  I still believe, and that's one of the reasons I started this program called TakeYourMoneyBack.com, if we want to end tyranny in America, we have to end the cash flow to the government.
[00:53:19.907 --> 00:53:22.229]  You know, Jack Buddha thugs will not work for free.
[00:53:23.550 --> 00:53:27.954]  And if there's no money to pay them, there's no money to finance their agencies,
[00:53:29.350 --> 00:53:40.113]  That's probably the best way, the most effective way to end all this crazy... No, I agree, but Ron Paul says we don't even have to do it, because they're going to bankrupt everything before it happens, and that may actually stop them.
[00:53:40.313 --> 00:53:41.653]  We're going to come back in the final segment.
[00:53:41.693 --> 00:53:42.773]  Is Charles gone, John?
[00:53:43.473 --> 00:53:44.133]  Yes, he dropped off.
[00:53:44.153 --> 00:53:45.594]  Alright, I appreciate his call.
[00:53:45.614 --> 00:53:46.914]  I only have time for two more.
[00:53:46.974 --> 00:53:48.554]  What, Fred in Philly?
[00:53:49.194 --> 00:53:50.175]  And Scott in Colorado.
[00:53:50.235 --> 00:53:50.975]  Alright, that's it.
[00:53:50.995 --> 00:53:51.275]  Here we go.
[00:53:56.496 --> 00:53:59.297]  The Global Corporate Crime Syndicate fully controls our federal government.
[00:53:59.317 --> 00:54:00.417]  They're moving against the people.
[00:54:00.457 --> 00:54:01.858]  They know we know they're criminals.
[00:54:01.878 --> 00:54:03.298]  That's why they're bringing in the police state.
[00:54:03.678 --> 00:54:04.359]  God help us.
[00:54:04.919 --> 00:54:08.560]  To every good person in government, please stand with us.
[00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:09.981]  Choose which side you're on.
[00:54:10.481 --> 00:54:10.821]  Now.
[00:54:12.041 --> 00:54:13.002]  This is life and death.
[00:54:13.042 --> 00:54:14.242]  Larry Pratt and Aaron Zellman.
[00:54:14.362 --> 00:54:16.363]  I'll be popping back in with us this week if they can.
[00:54:16.963 --> 00:54:18.003]  We can hear the ruling today.
[00:54:18.083 --> 00:54:19.624]  Tomorrow it could be as late as next Monday.
[00:54:19.644 --> 00:54:21.444]  Zellman thinks Thursday.
[00:54:21.765 --> 00:54:23.925]  Pratt's saying his lawyers are saying it could be as late as Monday.
[00:54:25.026 --> 00:54:25.726]  Very ominous.
[00:54:27.523 --> 00:54:30.845]  JPFO.org, Gun Owners of America, GunOwners.org.
[00:54:30.945 --> 00:54:32.006]  Join them both, support them.
[00:54:32.706 --> 00:54:34.147]  Join the InfoWar today, folks.
[00:54:34.167 --> 00:54:35.208]  This isn't a joke, okay?
[00:54:35.228 --> 00:54:38.330]  A lot of you hate guns because you were never brought up around them, you don't understand.
[00:54:38.610 --> 00:54:39.571]  Let me just give you a newsflash.
[00:54:39.951 --> 00:54:42.693]  Hitler was for gun control, the Ku Klux Klan was.
[00:54:43.953 --> 00:54:45.434]  Slaves are disarmed, okay?
[00:54:45.454 --> 00:54:46.295]  Let me give you a newsflash.
[00:54:46.755 --> 00:54:48.116]  Slaves in Rome were disarmed.
[00:54:48.656 --> 00:54:50.698]  This is about your enslavement.
[00:54:51.518 --> 00:54:53.900]  And, my God, it's just unbelievable.
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:55.220]  Let's go ahead and
[00:54:56.977 --> 00:54:59.358]  Talk to Fred in Philly and then Scott in California.
[00:54:59.398 --> 00:55:00.598]  Last callers, quickly, go ahead.
[00:55:00.618 --> 00:55:02.079]  Okay, Alex?
[00:55:02.359 --> 00:55:03.660]  Yes.
[00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:17.365]  I just want to say that you're doing a great job, and the thing to remember is that this is an inalienable right, and it existed even before you had our present Constitution.
[00:55:18.205 --> 00:55:20.446]  The Declaration of Independence states that.
[00:55:20.566 --> 00:55:25.488]  It's an organic right that comes from your being a free human creature, exactly.
[00:55:26.019 --> 00:55:38.243]  And the other thing is that Justice Breyer has been putting on complete fallacious reasoning because he says that should no locale have the right to
[00:55:40.157 --> 00:55:44.058]  Restrict firearms, and it's not the locale that has the right.
[00:55:44.098 --> 00:55:47.019]  It's only the individual that has that God-given right.
[00:55:47.119 --> 00:55:48.079]  And they all know that.
[00:55:48.359 --> 00:55:49.800]  Those arch crooks all know it.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.580]  They were made Supreme Court justices because they're whores.
[00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:53.881]  They're political pimps.
[00:55:54.281 --> 00:55:55.241]  I appreciate your call.
[00:55:55.281 --> 00:55:56.641]  Comments on that, Larry and Aaron.
[00:55:57.842 --> 00:56:02.383]  Well, it's hard to argue with the fact that it isn't an alienable
[00:56:02.918 --> 00:56:03.118]  Right.
[00:56:03.158 --> 00:56:04.519]  It's the way God made us.
[00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:09.964]  He didn't give us the gift of life so that we could throw it away to crooks and to tyrants.
[00:56:10.304 --> 00:56:10.724]  Period.
[00:56:11.184 --> 00:56:12.405]  Humans have always fought.
[00:56:12.425 --> 00:56:14.007]  We've always had tools and weapons.
[00:56:14.927 --> 00:56:20.852]  Let me just share a thought with you very quickly from a Jewish perspective concerning defending your life.
[00:56:21.813 --> 00:56:23.194]  There's a quote from the Talmud.
[00:56:23.234 --> 00:56:27.377]  It says, if a man comes to kill you, arise quickly and kill him.
[00:56:28.558 --> 00:56:31.120]  And I think Americans need to understand that quote fully.
[00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:35.313]  They have to think about it, and think about it, and then be ready to act.
[00:56:36.194 --> 00:56:37.234]  Well, it's common sense.
[00:56:38.536 --> 00:56:42.279]  And when you have a nation of people that are wimps, the tyrants will come.
[00:56:42.599 --> 00:56:45.722]  When you've got a nation of people ready to fight to the death, you have liberty.
[00:56:45.742 --> 00:56:49.745]  I can't believe this is happening.
[00:56:50.246 --> 00:56:52.207]  At times like this, I can't even have composure, folks.
[00:56:53.008 --> 00:56:54.910]  Scott in California, final caller, go ahead.
[00:56:56.806 --> 00:56:58.187]  Yeah, you're looking for Scott in Colorado?
[00:56:58.407 --> 00:56:59.088]  Okay, Colorado.
[00:56:59.108 --> 00:56:59.548]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:56:59.968 --> 00:57:01.669]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[00:57:01.729 --> 00:57:02.610]  Larry and Aaron.
[00:57:03.090 --> 00:57:06.813]  Hey, real quick, what is the definition of a well-organized militia?
[00:57:07.473 --> 00:57:10.735]  Well, that's something that George Mason coined.
[00:57:10.775 --> 00:57:26.426]  It was a term that he began to use in 1775 in the face of growing British oppression, not only closing down legislatures but making it illegal for militias to meet, banning the importation of guns,
[00:57:28.057 --> 00:57:46.110]  The colonists were coming upon a very difficult time in defending themselves, and to distinguish then from what the Brits were trying to do in this particular case to the militia, Mason coined the term of a well-regulated militia, which would be the embodiment of the power of the people.
[00:57:46.130 --> 00:57:52.075]  Yeah, regulated just means every town's got a bunch of people armed and trained, but directed by the locals.
[00:57:52.751 --> 00:58:03.300]  Train being the key element in the word, and as you say, by locals, these things were under government authority, under municipal authority of the people there on the ground.
[00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:04.401]  Yes, we're out of time.
[00:58:04.461 --> 00:58:09.606]  We'll check in with Aaron Zellman, JPFO.org, GunOwners.org, with Larry Pratt.
[00:58:09.666 --> 00:58:10.466]  Thank you, men.
[00:58:10.486 --> 00:58:11.687]  We appreciate you.
[00:58:11.727 --> 00:58:12.228]  God bless.
[00:58:12.748 --> 00:58:13.409]  Take care, Alec.
[00:58:14.142 --> 00:58:14.523]  All right.
[00:58:14.683 --> 00:58:15.083]  Thank you.
[00:58:15.143 --> 00:58:17.125]  We'll talk to those guys as this ruling comes out.
[00:58:17.186 --> 00:58:17.646]  Thank you.
[00:58:18.207 --> 00:58:19.508]  We're out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:19.628 --> 00:58:22.391]  Rebroadcast starts now at InfoWars.com.
[00:58:22.812 --> 00:58:24.113]  Incredible interviews today.
[00:58:24.153 --> 00:58:27.837]  They all restart on the internet streams only at InfoWars.com.
[00:58:27.857 --> 00:58:28.518]  God bless you all.
[00:58:28.558 --> 00:58:29.519]  See you back live tomorrow.
[00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:31.762]  But for everybody else, InfoWars.com.
[00:58:33.424 --> 00:58:35.166]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
