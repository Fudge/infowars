[00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:03.351]  So does he.
[00:00:03.991 --> 00:00:07.633]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:08.194 --> 00:00:12.236]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.685 --> 00:00:27.847]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live here.
[00:00:28.048 --> 00:00:39.076]  We're transmitting over the AM and FM dial, global shortwave, the internet, satellite, and of course over PrisonPlanet.TV now for the next two hours.
[00:00:39.116 --> 00:00:45.441]  We're getting connected up with him in Europe, Michael Tesarian, very interesting guest.
[00:00:45.461 --> 00:00:48.323]  We've never had him on before, but I'm familiar with his work.
[00:00:48.343 --> 00:00:51.766]  And I'll say this, I'm going as far
[00:00:53.035 --> 00:00:54.156]  With him as I can.
[00:00:54.176 --> 00:01:04.763]  You know, he's a character a lot like David Icke in that he's alternative in his views from kind of the mainstream of alternative media and research.
[00:01:05.424 --> 00:01:08.926]  But I think it's important work he's done and interesting and thought-provoking.
[00:01:10.127 --> 00:01:17.572]  And I know this, what he's discovered about the elite, what the elite believe about themselves, what their mindset is,
[00:01:18.813 --> 00:01:46.361]  uh... is uh... very very accurate for my own research of what they believe about themselves now is it real you know i uh... you know or ghost and goblins and all this real the point is the elite believe that they are channeling entities they are into the occult they do engage in satanism and occultism there are secret societies running our world there is a new world order uh... and so as soon as we get him on the line will bring him up uh... after the break
[00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:57.778]  Some of the other news that we've been covering today, for those that just joined us, is the fact that the U.S.
[00:01:57.818 --> 00:02:01.901]  Private Central Bank, the Federal Reserve, has pledged unlimited dollars.
[00:02:02.882 --> 00:02:04.243]  Unlimited dollars!
[00:02:05.324 --> 00:02:09.107]  Now, for a new dollar to be created, a debt is created.
[00:02:09.127 --> 00:02:10.868]  A dollar of debt that taxpayers have to pay back.
[00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.113]  So, foreign banks, foreign corporations, foreign insurance companies are being flooded.
[00:02:16.133 --> 00:02:16.873]  We keep talking about
[00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:39.247]  hyperinflation this is mega hyperinflation uh... this is intensified hyperinflation this is you know every day it's not trillions it's the hundreds of trillions are talking about globally flooding the planet with u.s.
[00:02:39.287 --> 00:02:40.087]  dollars in u.s.
[00:02:40.147 --> 00:02:42.928]  backed government securities
[00:02:44.434 --> 00:02:49.299]  And ladies and gentlemen, to pay those securities when they come due, the tax man comes to knock on your door.
[00:02:49.580 --> 00:03:02.974]  So not only have these foreign international banks set up a system where they triple A rated junk, or credit card debt, housing debt, and then sold the debt into the market as a premium investment.
[00:03:04.366 --> 00:03:07.669]  Most of the international, the media is blaming it on the American people.
[00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:09.350]  We're certainly suckers, but a small part of it.
[00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:18.817]  And then now we're going to have to pay back all of this through income tax, and they're going to double taxes with hyperinflation, devaluing the currency.
[00:03:20.078 --> 00:03:24.101]  And I know I keep talking about that because this is the end of the economy as we know it.
[00:03:24.141 --> 00:03:24.561]  This will be
[00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:28.624]  Just so devastating, it is hard to even imagine.
[00:03:29.464 --> 00:03:32.046]  Iceland, their money is being devalued very quickly.
[00:03:32.086 --> 00:03:39.012]  Their grocery stores have seen double the volume of shoppers as their banks collapse and as they may not, quote, be able to buy more food.
[00:03:40.193 --> 00:03:45.016]  That is out of the Associated Press and Bloomberg today.
[00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:50.014]  And the globalists, the New World Order, crowded the same thing in Argentina.
[00:03:50.854 --> 00:03:51.995]  But I challenge you to go read the story.
[00:03:52.015 --> 00:03:54.557]  I have a link to it up on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[00:03:55.097 --> 00:03:59.260]  Icelandic shoppers splurge as currency woes reduce food imports.
[00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:03.083]  After a four-year spending spree, Icelanders are flooding.
[00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:11.574]  The supermarkets, one last time, stocking up on food as the collapse of the banking system threatens to cut the island off from imports.
[00:04:12.254 --> 00:04:15.016]  And food and things are exploding in price in England and Japan.
[00:04:15.496 --> 00:04:16.737]  Islands are particularly hard hit.
[00:04:17.197 --> 00:04:26.302]  We have had crazy days for a week now, said Johan Samari Olvenson, manager of the Bonus Discount grocery store.
[00:04:27.322 --> 00:04:31.065]  Sales have doubled, and it goes into the currency plunging, the banks shutting down.
[00:04:31.825 --> 00:04:34.947]  And that's going to happen here, but in slower motion.
[00:04:35.568 --> 00:04:40.511]  So the banks are shoring themselves up, so they're strong to buy everything up after they implode the markets.
[00:04:41.412 --> 00:04:46.755]  That's why you saw the financial terrorism of the world's leaders saying, depression, depression, depression, in the last three weeks.
[00:04:46.795 --> 00:04:50.418]  That is to drive markets down, so they can destroy confidence and consolidate.
[00:04:51.658 --> 00:04:53.380]  Lead from solder and copper pipes.
[00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.620]  Mercury from fish.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.481]  Dental fillings.
[00:04:55.621 --> 00:04:56.221]  Vaccines.
[00:04:56.382 --> 00:04:56.722]  Arsenic.
[00:04:57.492 --> 00:04:58.753]  Discount grocery store.
[00:04:59.714 --> 00:05:00.535]  Sales have doubled.
[00:05:00.955 --> 00:05:03.477]  And it goes into the currency plunging, the banks shutting down.
[00:05:04.218 --> 00:05:07.341]  And that's going to happen here but in slower motion.
[00:05:07.961 --> 00:05:12.945]  So the banks are stirring themselves up so they're strong to buy everything up after they implode the markets.
[00:05:13.806 --> 00:05:19.171]  That's why you saw the financial terrorism of the world's leaders saying depression, depression, depression in the last three weeks.
[00:05:19.211 --> 00:05:22.774]  That is to drive markets down so they can destroy confidence and consolidate.
[00:05:23.988 --> 00:05:24.408]  I'm good.
[00:05:41.513 --> 00:05:41.873]  I don't know.
[00:06:03.524 --> 00:06:04.725]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:06:04.785 --> 00:06:07.806]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:06:07.826 --> 00:06:08.907]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.679]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:40.460]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.701]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:06:44.981 --> 00:06:49.882]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[00:06:50.182 --> 00:06:52.942]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.
[00:06:53.222 --> 00:06:57.263]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded or streamed in super high quality.
[00:06:57.583 --> 00:06:57.943]  We're good.
[00:07:24.628 --> 00:07:28.531]  Would you like to know how you can use water as fuel and laugh at the rising price of gas?
[00:07:28.992 --> 00:07:31.013]  Then keep listening for a very special offer.
[00:07:31.514 --> 00:07:36.818]  GasFreedom.info has the information you need to learn about the newest hydrogen technology available.
[00:07:37.178 --> 00:07:40.341]  GasFreedom is an affordable, practical, free energy device.
[00:07:40.921 --> 00:07:45.265]  It uses electricity from your car's battery to separate water into a gas called HHO.
[00:07:46.886 --> 00:07:48.147]  Yeah, John, we're on air right now.
[00:07:48.187 --> 00:07:48.567]  What's up?
[00:08:20.091 --> 00:08:21.912]  Alright, our guest is in Europe right now.
[00:08:21.932 --> 00:08:28.635]  He was born in Ireland and he has made a lot of films, written quite a few books, very prolific.
[00:08:29.215 --> 00:08:31.596]  We've had a lot of listeners request that we have him on.
[00:08:31.616 --> 00:08:45.242]  I want to really get him to talk about the nature of his awakening and then I wanted to just get into what we can prove with Michael Tesarin today about what the elite believe and from his in-depth research, he's done a lot of great research,
[00:08:46.302 --> 00:08:50.763]  Who the global elite are, what their driving mindset is.
[00:08:50.783 --> 00:09:01.906]  We know they have a kingdom of cults, a hierarchical pyramidal structure of power, but who is at the top of that pyramid, and from his unique perspective, what their agenda is.
[00:09:02.346 --> 00:09:06.848]  So we're really honored to have Michael Desarian on with us for the next hour and 15 minutes.
[00:09:06.908 --> 00:09:07.868]  Michael, welcome.
[00:09:09.162 --> 00:09:10.042]  Oh, thanks a lot, Alex.
[00:09:10.102 --> 00:09:10.842]  It's nice to be on.
[00:09:10.883 --> 00:09:11.863]  Thanks for the invitation.
[00:09:12.223 --> 00:09:12.443]  You bet.
[00:09:12.503 --> 00:09:12.843]  It's great.
[00:09:12.883 --> 00:09:15.164]  I'm a big supporter, big supporter of your work.
[00:09:15.844 --> 00:09:23.726]  Followed it from the beginning and just want to offer you my, you know, total congratulations, not only on your work, but the gutsy way that you've been doing it.
[00:09:23.846 --> 00:09:34.589]  And I just want to say to all your listeners out there, if we had more people like you and as gutsy as you to back up what you're talking about with action, you know, we wouldn't be in the mess in America that, you know, we are today.
[00:09:35.907 --> 00:09:38.709]  Give you a lot of kudos for what you've been doing through the years, Alex.
[00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:40.710]  Well, Michael, kudos to you.
[00:09:41.571 --> 00:10:00.882]  For some of my audience that may not know who you are, tell us a little bit about yourself, your awakening, and then let's strike a chord in the present with what the global banking structure is doing, your point of view, your perspective on what's happening there, and then let's get into what makes the New World Order tick and what their endgame is, Michael.
[00:10:02.023 --> 00:10:02.483]  Right, thanks.
[00:10:03.723 --> 00:10:06.045]  My research has started pretty much in Ireland.
[00:10:06.325 --> 00:10:11.369]  And by 13 years of age, I started to realize, you know, two things.
[00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:18.415]  One is that we're being told nothing but a tissue of lies from the official, orthodox, fundamentalistic sort of educational system.
[00:10:18.455 --> 00:10:20.617]  It just doesn't fit the facts.
[00:10:20.697 --> 00:10:24.761]  Growing up in Belfast at that time was very difficult because there was a lot of violence and trouble.
[00:10:25.401 --> 00:10:30.065]  But basically, I started to see through that and check out the, you know, the orange parades that happened on July.
[00:10:31.678 --> 00:10:57.132]  And seeing a lot of the symbolism that was being used there, where one thing led to another, through the study of this symbolism that's being used by the Orange Order, I suddenly started to research the history of the Orange Order, discovered that it's not so much a political, you know, organization as it is a fraternal brotherhood, and then I subsequently later, you know, a few years later, started discovering that this is the same story with the IRA, particularly the Provisional IRA, and then we have the Official IRA,
[00:10:57.745 --> 00:11:06.472]  And then I started to notice, by tracking through all the different symbolism and then going through the research works and the reference works, that basically what we're dealing here is a one-party system.
[00:11:07.053 --> 00:11:25.708]  You know, I mean, this is in the early days, so I didn't have the whole globalist picture here, but just from my own researches in the micro, you know, microcosm of Ireland growing up there, I realized that, you know, we're not being told the truth about these organizations, and how these are connected to the super-Masonic orders, the pre-Masonic orders,
[00:11:26.212 --> 00:11:37.262]  So basically around 15-16 years of age, again pretty much in an Irish context, I broadened my study to look into this whole movement of the secret societies in the world.
[00:11:37.782 --> 00:11:48.131]  And this was, you know, a little bit before coming across the works of the great American scholars like the G. Edward Griffiths and the Eustace Mullins and the Jordan Maxwells and so forth and so on, you know.
[00:11:48.271 --> 00:11:52.115]  I mean, I hadn't had exposure to these thinkers.
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.841]  Even the Ralph Eppersons, you know, all the people who basically connect all the dots.
[00:11:57.861 --> 00:12:07.443]  I had to wait till I came to America, you know, in sort of 82, and then later on in the 90s to really sort of have these teachers help put things together.
[00:12:07.883 --> 00:12:22.286]  But I noticed that, you see, in America, a few people have the whole European understanding of how the British Royals, how some of the Fabian networks, how the Common Purpose, how some of the groups like the Club of the Isles,
[00:12:23.092 --> 00:12:39.025]  And this connects again with high-level Freemasonry, not only Scottish Rite Freemasonry, but like I say, the Orange Order, the orders that are behind the IRA, like the Irish Republic and Brotherhood, the Ancient Order of Hibernians, the Green Ribbon Society, the Clan Magale, all from an Irish context.
[00:12:39.586 --> 00:12:45.651]  My studies then continued to show me that these groups that are funded and armed to the teeth, basically what
[00:12:46.212 --> 00:12:50.259]  The public knows terrorist organizations operating in Ireland are far from merely Irish.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:55.369]  These groups are connected to the internationally free underground of the entire black hand.
[00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:57.923]  Meaning the entire terrorist network.
[00:12:58.183 --> 00:13:04.167]  And that's used to destabilize and frighten the public into accepting the state dominating them.
[00:13:04.467 --> 00:13:12.412]  And it's even come out in mainstream news now that the IRA and the Orange, the Protestants at the highest levels, were really meeting and working together.
[00:13:13.172 --> 00:13:17.095]  And that they were all basically British and international intelligence just completely staged.
[00:13:18.228 --> 00:13:19.089]  On a very high level.
[00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:25.299]  Again, when you point your finger in this direction, people, you know, they sort of poo-poo that they can't see that because they've been so brainwashed.
[00:13:25.679 --> 00:13:30.086]  They've been so, you know, brainwashed by the media that they don't check these things out.
[00:13:30.186 --> 00:13:31.628]  I'm one of only three.
[00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:33.851]  There's three of us that have, you know, studied the
[00:13:34.676 --> 00:13:43.826]  Well, I just know it's come out all over the mainstream news and I've had a lot of the former British commandos S.A.S.
[00:13:44.046 --> 00:13:49.632]  on who they would finally get to the top of the IRA and all three of the leaders were all British intelligence
[00:13:50.353 --> 00:14:06.743]  And then they would, you know, infiltrate the Orange and find out, you know, that the three heads of the IRA were meeting with the three heads of the Orange, and it was just a way to terrorize the public, and they used the infighting and the bombings as a pretext to basically murder and kill and oppress whoever they want.
[00:14:07.683 --> 00:14:19.630]  They've done that, and by consistently, you know, this incredible fear and death toll, and the murder of innocent people in the country on both sides, I'm talking because I'm not partisan, I'm not siding with either side, I'm just looking at this thing
[00:14:20.049 --> 00:14:21.013]  You know, from the overview.
[00:14:21.274 --> 00:14:24.345]  Yeah, that trouble made Ireland a third world country in the West.
[00:14:24.727 --> 00:14:28.670]  They degraded the people, they kept them ignorant, they kept them stupid while they used the land.
[00:14:55.947 --> 00:14:57.448]  How many jugglers can you get in a room?
[00:14:57.688 --> 00:15:00.208]  How many pit bulls can you get into a pen, you know?
[00:15:00.488 --> 00:15:11.231]  This is, I saw firsthand in the Irish context, also, that these groups were connected to these higher Masonic orders, because we're not talking about the street-level stuff here that, you know, people are never going to get their mind around at all.
[00:15:11.771 --> 00:15:19.673]  But anyone who studied the British system and how these clubs and these organizations, fraternal orders, are networked into these terrorist organizations, how they fund them,
[00:15:20.231 --> 00:15:20.471]  I think?
[00:15:37.981 --> 00:15:38.822]  And really it's a gang.
[00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:14.790]  And of course, most masons are well-meaning, good people that understand that the higher levels of their order have been used as a vehicle for secret intelligence agency operations is basically what's happening.
[00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:27.678]  And the New World Order goes to like a wardrobe with a Catholic outfit, a Jewish outfit, a Muslim outfit, a Protestant outfit, and they just put that cloak on, and that's why it's so hard to get after them.
[00:16:28.098 --> 00:16:30.060]  But we know the overriding thing they want
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:36.462]  You know, they say they're trying to get rid of government, but really they create the mega-state through which they can control the society.
[00:16:37.562 --> 00:16:46.525]  And I'm very concerned about what you just said about the fact that we have to start appealing... I mean, my main message is for the complete disbandingment of all secret societies.
[00:16:46.545 --> 00:16:48.865]  You know, I don't belong to any secret society, never have done.
[00:16:49.285 --> 00:16:56.207]  And the message that is often recurrent through my own work is for the total illegality, the making of all these kinds of secret societies.
[00:16:56.227 --> 00:16:58.668]  I don't care if it's Opus Di or Scottish Rite Freemasonry.
[00:16:59.128 --> 00:17:04.670]  With the masses of the world that need to actually start integrating laws that make these groups absolutely illegal.
[00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:14.794]  But more than that, in the meantime, until we do that, my message actually goes out to members, like some of these, the good folks, the good people who are, you know, the rank and file of these orders.
[00:17:15.235 --> 00:17:25.799]  That's why my research has taken me into the subject of masonry and into the occultism, and I've had a lot of backlash from that, from people who don't have a clue in their heads as to why you want to maybe study this kind of subject matter.
[00:17:26.019 --> 00:17:28.600]  Well, how the hell are you going to appeal to people who are, you know,
[00:17:29.696 --> 00:17:37.899]  Well-meaning members of these various secret societies, unless you speak in their own language, in order to try and explain to them some of the symbolism and the rites and the rituals where it comes from.
[00:17:38.399 --> 00:17:41.681]  Not that some of the rites and rituals are wrong, it's just that you're doing a normal critique.
[00:17:41.981 --> 00:17:45.222]  In order to relate to these people, you've got to know what they're doing.
[00:17:45.382 --> 00:17:53.205]  You've got to know what... Well, Michael, I don't want to disagree with you, but anything that has the power to ban something,
[00:17:54.245 --> 00:17:55.826]  You know, there's a right of association.
[00:17:57.087 --> 00:17:59.308]  It itself could turn into a great tyranny.
[00:17:59.328 --> 00:18:01.109]  I mean, I think there should be public exposure.
[00:18:01.849 --> 00:18:03.270]  There should be open discussions.
[00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:12.494]  If groups are found to be involved in collusion, you know, the classic case of, you know, somebody who's committed a murder, you know, the mason in distress sign and they're let off.
[00:18:12.514 --> 00:18:14.095]  That happened with a great-uncle I had.
[00:18:14.135 --> 00:18:15.096]  I mean, he told us about it.
[00:18:15.136 --> 00:18:17.217]  It wasn't, it was the cases in the newspaper.
[00:18:17.737 --> 00:18:28.260]  But, you know, his argument was he had to go through a Masonic trial afterwards, you know, to find out if that was, you know, true or they would have, quote, dealt with him, you know, drowning him, if he would have lied.
[00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:34.341]  You tell low-level Masons that, they just don't, you know, they're just not aware of the higher-level things that go on.
[00:18:34.401 --> 00:18:46.184]  But, asking you a question, I mean, how do you say ban these things, you know, the engine that could ban these societies would rise up into a mighty tyranny itself?
[00:18:47.591 --> 00:18:53.054]  Yeah, there's always that danger, and there's always the danger that, you know, by making them illegal, they go underground.
[00:18:53.094 --> 00:19:01.498]  It's not a total win-lose solution, but what needs to happen is that the ordinary people have got to find out about the tiger and the long grass, and at least arm themselves up with even a modicum.
[00:19:01.719 --> 00:19:03.279]  I mean, that's what our programs are doing.
[00:19:03.299 --> 00:19:04.240]  That's what our work is doing.
[00:19:04.645 --> 00:19:05.786]  And you do have to address it.
[00:19:05.906 --> 00:19:08.088]  I like to address them because it's better to address them.
[00:19:08.108 --> 00:19:13.232]  You know, you can address the beginners, you can address the seasoned, and you have to address the insider as well.
[00:19:13.292 --> 00:19:14.813]  So my work goes a lot to the insiders.
[00:19:14.833 --> 00:19:16.335]  I mean, you said it yourself a few minutes ago.
[00:19:16.855 --> 00:19:20.658]  You had insiders from the Orange Lodge, insiders from the IRA, whistleblowers.
[00:19:21.219 --> 00:19:32.428]  And if you look back through the whole conspiracy movement and the exposure, you'll find that the greatest damage is being done by the generals, by the insiders, by the politicians, you know, even up to the level of presidents who've come out and written memoirs.
[00:19:33.419 --> 00:19:43.685]  Okay, Michael, listen, I'm going to skip this break for Infowars.com listeners.
[00:19:43.705 --> 00:19:46.287]  We'll get a little behind the scenes since we got you on late.
[00:19:46.307 --> 00:19:49.429]  I want to do a little bit of a pre-interview to see what you wanted to get into.
[00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:51.530]  We'll discuss that now for the internet audience only.
[00:19:53.351 --> 00:19:55.635]  Okay, we're on the internet now, not on the AM and FM.
[00:19:55.675 --> 00:19:57.358]  We've got about three or four minutes before we're back.
[00:19:57.878 --> 00:20:00.823]  Michael, I want to really give you a chance to run today.
[00:20:01.344 --> 00:20:05.571]  What is it, because we didn't do a pre-interview, what is it you want to get into today?
[00:20:07.236 --> 00:20:08.317]  Well, there's so much, you know.
[00:20:08.337 --> 00:20:14.461]  I mean, again, my history started... I didn't know that when I came to America that I was going to be knee-deep in all of this kind of thing, you know.
[00:20:14.501 --> 00:20:18.784]  But my philosophy is always to come to another country and do as the Romans do, you know.
[00:20:19.044 --> 00:20:26.309]  So I wanted to learn about American history and I found out that, you know, we always know in Ireland that the Scots-Irish, you know, fought in your War of Independence.
[00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:30.352]  I also found out subsequently that America is famous for losing the wars it wins.
[00:20:30.842 --> 00:20:41.168]  And that, you know, the British Crown, and I'm not talking about British people here, but I'm talking about the oligarchy that's preying over them, you know, realized that it got its ass kicked in a situation of war.
[00:20:41.288 --> 00:20:43.550]  It couldn't take America with force of arms.
[00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:46.531]  It tried it, and it... So it did it through roundtable groups.
[00:20:47.432 --> 00:20:47.932]  Exactly.
[00:20:47.992 --> 00:20:50.554]  And Cecil Rhodes and these people have been my study for, you know,
[00:20:51.187 --> 00:20:52.128]  As long as I can remember.
[00:20:52.448 --> 00:20:53.308]  And that's why I came in.
[00:20:53.368 --> 00:20:59.611]  Not just studying the Fabian movements, not just studying these Masonic orders, you see, but also studying their context.
[00:20:59.671 --> 00:21:02.073]  I suddenly start realizing these people are operating in America.
[00:21:02.393 --> 00:21:10.517]  So my message was to get people out of the political pigsty and say, your troubles are not necessarily within the political sphere.
[00:21:10.537 --> 00:21:11.458]  That's just an effect.
[00:21:11.478 --> 00:21:12.258]  That's not the cause.
[00:21:12.927 --> 00:21:19.111]  And then try to point out the surreptitious war of attrition that's been fought on American shores for the destruction of America.
[00:21:19.351 --> 00:21:30.678]  That was the main point, you know, when I got to America, started to go into the public eye and make this be known, because as I said... And then people will say, well, then they'll say, well, Masons founded America, but that's the whole point.
[00:21:30.758 --> 00:21:34.360]  Bill destroy, Bill destroy, Bill destroy, order out of chaos.
[00:21:34.801 --> 00:21:36.582]  And you've got the lower orders that weren't aware.
[00:21:36.602 --> 00:21:38.363]  You've also had some changes in Masonry.
[00:21:38.863 --> 00:21:45.105]  And George Washington, as you know, came out and spoke out against those groups that were coming in and infiltrating it and changing it.
[00:21:45.585 --> 00:21:49.527]  But really, he was just breaking through and finding out about higher levels to it.
[00:21:49.867 --> 00:22:01.131]  But we have to also understand that there was the secret destiny, as you know, of the United States, where they talked about the 1600s coming here and founding this as the new Atlantis.
[00:22:02.171 --> 00:22:05.312]  So there's the argument, you know, it's always dueled, yin-yang.
[00:22:05.652 --> 00:22:15.595]  You're right on the ball, and it's great to talk to somebody like this who knows that before the official founding of America, these Templars and their agents were already ensconced in the country.
[00:22:15.715 --> 00:22:19.236]  Yeah, they had a bad day yesterday on the 13th anniversary.
[00:22:19.876 --> 00:22:20.616]  That's right.
[00:22:21.236 --> 00:22:28.378]  And we have, you know, the thing that John Adams, President John Adams, President George Washington, they did start to, you know, whistle-blow what was going on.
[00:22:28.438 --> 00:22:31.899]  Yeah, Adams had the anti-Masonic party that came up later.
[00:22:32.697 --> 00:22:33.098]  That's right.
[00:22:33.478 --> 00:22:35.081]  But they did it from being insiders first.
[00:22:35.401 --> 00:22:39.628]  First they hobnobbed with Adam Weishaupt and his cronies.
[00:22:40.049 --> 00:22:46.720]  They hobnobbed with the agents of people like Charles D. Lorraine, you know, from the province of Lorraine in France and the Grand Orient Freemasonry of France.
[00:22:47.173 --> 00:22:51.096]  And then they start to realize, wait a minute, this is a bunch of Luciferianism here, it's not right for America.
[00:22:51.416 --> 00:22:52.837]  And they sounded the warning, you know?
[00:22:53.157 --> 00:23:12.550]  In a modern context, though, these people who are working for the old British system, you know, who operate, people gotta realize that these people have worked through the Russell Trust, they've worked through the Scalabones, they've worked through the Knights of Columbus, they've worked through Scottish Rite Freemasonry, they're alive and well in the American context to take America down because it was too big to take down with a gun to the head situation.
[00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:17.411]  You know, that kind of thing, that jackboot system does work in a small... Okay, we'll get into that.
[00:23:17.431 --> 00:23:28.693]  I also want to get into the hierarchy of the New World Order and the power structure, kind of a historical overview, because I know you're very well informed and I want your unique perspective on that as well.
[00:23:29.153 --> 00:23:34.034]  Okay, so we'll talk about the secret history of the United States and the war with these forces.
[00:23:34.074 --> 00:23:36.935]  We'll talk about who the Globalists are, what their master plan is.
[00:23:37.295 --> 00:23:38.895]  What's some of the other things you want to get into briefly?
[00:23:40.296 --> 00:23:41.437]  Oh, that's good to go with.
[00:23:41.557 --> 00:23:42.717]  We've got an hour, so that's great.
[00:23:42.958 --> 00:23:46.580]  We also want to get into maybe the technology aspect.
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.881]  Hold on, hold on.
[00:23:48.921 --> 00:23:50.302]  We've got an hour and forty minutes, Michael.
[00:23:51.263 --> 00:23:54.084]  Okay, but you're good for an hour and forty, right?
[00:23:55.185 --> 00:23:57.326]  And the whole technological war.
[00:23:57.346 --> 00:23:57.946]  Alright, here we go.
[00:23:58.007 --> 00:23:58.327]  Here we go.
[00:24:00.508 --> 00:24:06.952]  We're going to go over the basic
[00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:16.237]  View from Michael Tesarian of British Secret Society Networks using Freemasonry as one vehicle because of its secrecy.
[00:24:16.998 --> 00:24:18.059]  They can inhabit any group.
[00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:23.283]  And then the secret symbolism, the language that's all around us that they communicate through.
[00:24:23.463 --> 00:24:24.985]  Again, the low-level Masons aren't even part of it.
[00:24:25.305 --> 00:24:27.407]  And there are other religious groups and secret groups.
[00:24:28.087 --> 00:24:30.129]  You know, Masons oversimplifies it.
[00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:33.512]  Then we'll get into what the endgame is and the
[00:24:35.233 --> 00:24:38.774]  Well, that was, you know, when I got over to States, then I had to basically brush up.
[00:24:39.235 --> 00:24:41.215]  And that's when I bumped into the work of Nord Davis.
[00:24:53.147 --> 00:24:55.690]  And especially Ralph Epperson, you know, who's just great.
[00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:57.813]  His work put a lot of pieces together for me.
[00:24:57.833 --> 00:25:02.098]  And then, of course, the great G. Edward Griffin and Eustace Mullins, you know, it became like a study.
[00:25:02.498 --> 00:25:10.067]  Because when I realized that the average American doesn't know anything about this, yeah, I'd bump into the average, you know, I'd bump into occasionally to a Vietnam vet.
[00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:19.748]  Who had been through so much hell, through the VA hospitals, that these guys knew, you know, something about what was going on, especially about the federal system and the Federal Reserve and so on.
[00:25:20.108 --> 00:25:30.698]  And so, my education began in the 90s, you know, to sort of brush up on, okay, I've seen it in an Irish context, I've seen that one picture of tyranny, but how does this work in the American context, you know?
[00:25:31.098 --> 00:25:36.643]  So, as I started to study more and got into the Webster, Tarpley's, you see, and even the Dr. John Coleman's
[00:25:37.483 --> 00:25:59.104]  It was a long discovery to find out that this country didn't really win the War of Independence because they let their guard down, they became so apathetic, they became so decadent and narcissistic that it was easy pickings right from the time of the first presidents basically for this federalistic group to insinuate itself into the body politic of America through the federal systems
[00:25:59.839 --> 00:26:07.324]  To get rid of the Republic, to change the Constitution, to amend it, and so forth and so on, all the stuff that you've covered yourself, and so many things.
[00:26:07.784 --> 00:26:19.812]  You know, this was my education to find out, but my main point was, though, is more of a historian aspect to say, look, never forget that America is just the last in line to be taken down.
[00:26:19.892 --> 00:26:23.794]  The people who are doing this have colonized and colonized the world.
[00:26:24.114 --> 00:26:27.857]  They've been doing it for centuries of time, and my research has led it back to Egypt,
[00:26:28.311 --> 00:26:31.613]  You know, first of all, I had studied the ancient Irish myths.
[00:26:32.114 --> 00:26:41.060]  That helped me, you know, with my first book on Atlantis, to get into a lot of areas there to show just how ancient this actual, you know, oligarchy is, that they keep bloodlines.
[00:26:41.481 --> 00:26:51.388]  And these bloodlines are still today, and the politicians that pop their heads up every, you know, every four years, there they are again with their bloodline connections back to the ancient royal oligarchs of Europe.
[00:26:51.948 --> 00:26:56.552]  But then what happened is I got more and more, you know, into it after the first book was done.
[00:26:57.222 --> 00:27:03.888]  Then I started to really look at the Egyptian roots of this, and my research took me to a group that I refer to as the Atenists.
[00:27:04.309 --> 00:27:10.755]  It's the same group of, you know, people would refer to, say, by the terms such as Luciferian or whatever.
[00:27:11.115 --> 00:27:12.756]  You know, my term for it is Atenists.
[00:27:12.937 --> 00:27:17.060]  This is going back to the 14th Dynasty, the 18th Dynasty of Europe.
[00:27:19.461 --> 00:27:24.223]  18th Dynasty of Egypt, about 1400 years BC, is where it all began.
[00:27:24.703 --> 00:27:28.044]  So I've actually traced it back to the reign of the pharaoh Akhenaten.
[00:27:28.724 --> 00:27:34.606]  Well just to be clear, when you read mainline, even British history, they say they're related to the pharaohs.
[00:27:34.646 --> 00:27:43.429]  They say they are related to Moses, and the queen is coronated on Jacob's stone, and all of this.
[00:27:43.949 --> 00:27:45.450]  And so they really believe this.
[00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:48.411]  And worldwide, international royalty, even in Japan,
[00:27:49.151 --> 00:27:57.795]  says that the greatest queen is the royalty in England and that they all claim they're part of that and are part of the same secret societies there.
[00:27:58.115 --> 00:28:02.498]  So regardless of whether it's true or not, they do claim lineage to the pharaohs.
[00:28:03.638 --> 00:28:09.701]  You're absolutely spot-on and you see it doesn't have to be necessarily just bloodline for a certain amount of the top boys.
[00:28:09.801 --> 00:28:13.823]  It is a bloodline connection for everybody else that serves this monster.
[00:28:13.903 --> 00:28:16.805]  It's an ideological connection.
[00:28:17.045 --> 00:28:17.425]  Equally
[00:28:17.964 --> 00:28:19.664]  Equally as bad, equally as pernicious.
[00:28:19.704 --> 00:28:23.705]  These are not people who serve the good of the human race, or for the uplift of the human race.
[00:28:23.745 --> 00:28:29.346]  These are ancient pharaohs who have kept bloodline dynasties, and people better believe that they have not gone away.
[00:28:29.867 --> 00:28:33.867]  The different houses of Europe that I address, you see, and the symbolism that they use.
[00:28:34.348 --> 00:28:45.850]  So as I start to track this back, it starts to explain these things about, like you say, the symbolism behind the coronation, and all the various other symbolism and regalia that we see throughout all of Europe, as well as Britain.
[00:28:46.238 --> 00:28:55.324]  And it was fascinating to see that, you know, how it all went back to this particular individual and his sort of megalomania, this Akhenaten, and his basically solar cult.
[00:28:55.344 --> 00:28:56.545]  These were worshippers of the sun.
[00:28:57.485 --> 00:28:59.947]  They were worshippers of what I refer to as the dark side of the sun.
[00:29:00.808 --> 00:29:04.730]  And, you know, their generation, they were expurged finally from Egypt.
[00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:14.957]  They had basically committed so much desecration on the land of Egypt that finally, you know, in the reign of Akhenaten, the people of Egypt rose up and basically exiled these guys.
[00:29:15.555 --> 00:29:16.075]  All right, stay there.
[00:29:16.095 --> 00:29:16.355]  Stay there.
[00:29:16.395 --> 00:29:17.096]  We'll be back in three minutes.
[00:29:17.116 --> 00:29:18.536]  Michael Desari and stay with me.
[00:29:18.556 --> 00:29:19.296]  We're on the march.
[00:29:19.316 --> 00:29:19.856]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:45.956 --> 00:29:48.758]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:57.663]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:29:57.903 --> 00:29:59.264]  And we knew what to do.
[00:29:59.945 --> 00:30:01.025]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:30:01.225 --> 00:30:07.649]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:14.974]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air
[00:30:15.657 --> 00:30:16.818]  We're safe to breathe.
[00:30:17.138 --> 00:30:23.964]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:30:24.264 --> 00:30:27.327]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:30:27.427 --> 00:30:32.651]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:30:33.192 --> 00:30:35.834]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[00:33:16.404 --> 00:33:22.968]  Well, it's michaeltesarian.com and the new DVD on technologyarchitectsofcontrol.com.
[00:33:24.554 --> 00:33:25.975]  Yeah, I was checking out the trailer for that.
[00:33:26.035 --> 00:33:27.556]  It looks really powerful.
[00:33:27.596 --> 00:33:30.539]  Tesarian is T-S-A-R-I-O-N.
[00:33:31.019 --> 00:33:32.620]  So micheltesarian.com.
[00:33:35.819 --> 00:33:40.501]  Now again, I don't know if the Queen of England is really related to Moses.
[00:33:41.181 --> 00:33:46.023]  I don't know if she's really related to the Egyptian pharaohs, B.C.
[00:33:46.983 --> 00:33:53.766]  I don't know if the Sun King of France, you know, was really related to Jesus' family.
[00:33:54.346 --> 00:33:56.207]  The point is, they believe they are.
[00:33:56.747 --> 00:33:57.908]  They take it deadly serious.
[00:33:57.948 --> 00:33:59.488]  And I've been inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:33:59.508 --> 00:34:00.709]  People say, oh, that's just a play.
[00:34:01.229 --> 00:34:02.470]  You know, a mock human sacrifice.
[00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:11.056]  Regardless of what it is, those old men that I was with in that crowd of about 1,500 watching the ritual, they were in religious rapture.
[00:34:11.096 --> 00:34:12.037]  They were grinding their teeth.
[00:34:12.077 --> 00:34:14.279]  They were breathing heavy.
[00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:27.129]  Whatever the real ritual was, was over behind some black curtains from the trees across the water before they brought the baby, the small child, the effigy over to burn it before Lilith.
[00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:30.151]  These occultists use different names.
[00:34:30.191 --> 00:34:30.971]  They call it Moloch.
[00:34:31.071 --> 00:34:34.152]  I know that's the bull, but they call their owl Moloch.
[00:34:35.873 --> 00:34:38.574]  They address it as a female, and then as a male deity.
[00:34:39.955 --> 00:34:46.778]  It's all on video in my film, The Order of Death, and then we had somebody else sneak in, who they then set up and sent to prison.
[00:34:47.518 --> 00:34:48.959]  Chris Jones, no relation to me.
[00:34:49.479 --> 00:34:50.819]  So this is really going on.
[00:34:50.939 --> 00:34:53.961]  They really believe this, whether it's true or not.
[00:34:54.061 --> 00:34:59.023]  I know you, from your deep research in Europe and around the world, believe that there is some basis in fact in it.
[00:34:59.703 --> 00:35:01.263]  So let's continue on, Michael.
[00:35:02.384 --> 00:35:03.284]  Well, that's right.
[00:35:03.644 --> 00:35:07.106]  Again, as far as I'm concerned, they believe it in their own heads.
[00:35:07.786 --> 00:35:12.768]  They're not only bloodline connection, they have the ideological henchmen who have sworn allegiance.
[00:35:13.462 --> 00:35:28.537]  For one reason or another, the basic fact is that my researchers did discover this connection to Egypt, not only there, but the basic origin of the Knights Templar, the Order of Sion, just the very Judaic phrases
[00:35:29.151 --> 00:35:32.715]  Which actually, you're more correctly to say, Egyptian atmospheric phrases.
[00:35:32.895 --> 00:35:34.497]  Well, let me stop you right there.
[00:35:34.517 --> 00:35:37.441]  I mean, that's an absolute fact, and that's not even hidden.
[00:35:37.981 --> 00:35:43.507]  That in, you know, basic Masonic literature and basic magic literature, white and black,
[00:35:44.328 --> 00:35:48.492]  It's all about the keys of Solomon, Solomon's ring, the seal of Solomon.
[00:35:49.193 --> 00:35:52.536]  It's all about controlling these djinn, these entities, these angels.
[00:35:53.097 --> 00:35:54.658]  And Solomon was open about it.
[00:35:54.678 --> 00:36:02.506]  It was the secret of Egypt, and the secrets of Greece, and the secrets of Babylon, and the secrets of all of these countries.
[00:36:02.546 --> 00:36:03.347]  And people then say,
[00:36:03.667 --> 00:36:05.627]  Well, the whole New World Order is Judaic.
[00:36:06.027 --> 00:36:10.928]  No, it was the Jews that codified it, and who were big on writing things down.
[00:36:11.208 --> 00:36:18.410]  And so when Alexandria got destroyed in Egypt, and when Rome got destroyed in its libraries, it was the Judaics who carried on the mystery schools.
[00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:19.650]  Right.
[00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:22.530]  Within that, not ordinary Jews, but this elite group.
[00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:24.010]  The Levites.
[00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:25.171]  The Levitical level.
[00:36:25.191 --> 00:36:30.792]  We're talking about the Kabbalistic, Levitical, Mosaic, and also what's called the Gaionim.
[00:36:30.832 --> 00:36:32.792]  This is a word that people have got to become familiar with.
[00:36:33.188 --> 00:36:36.271]  Because it explains the capital G that the masons use.
[00:36:36.351 --> 00:36:40.614]  You know, people want to pick up my Irish Origins of Civilization double volume.
[00:36:40.955 --> 00:37:01.752]  They're going to find chapter after chapter, they're showing this connection between the Judaic elites and the ancient pharaonics and then how that percolates down into modern times through this occult, you know, bloodline, dragon court thread that people really need to be understanding about so they can not only decode the symbolism, but they can find out the roots of this tyranny because we're here in the effects of the tyranny
[00:37:02.145 --> 00:37:04.066]  But we need to know its origins as well.
[00:37:04.506 --> 00:37:07.768]  And the most amazing thing is that these guys mean business.
[00:37:07.908 --> 00:37:09.529]  They lost an empire in the past.
[00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:13.792]  And they subsequently experienced an old world disorder.
[00:37:14.292 --> 00:37:22.857]  And so everything that's being built now, students of the new world order need to realize it's because they're trying to build a new world order to replace an old world order.
[00:37:22.977 --> 00:37:27.240]  And that's why their symbol is the pyramid of the all-seeing eye, which is the black sunshine.
[00:37:28.408 --> 00:37:28.828]  Exactly.
[00:37:28.888 --> 00:37:30.969]  These people do worship the dark side of the sun.
[00:37:30.989 --> 00:37:36.192]  They can rightly be referred... Christians refer to them as Luciferians, and it's perfectly adequate.
[00:37:36.312 --> 00:37:39.594]  And that's what the Nazis' secret highest was, the black sun.
[00:37:41.355 --> 00:37:45.197]  And people say, how could the Zionists and the Nazis worship the same thing?
[00:37:45.377 --> 00:37:46.157]  Because it doesn't matter.
[00:37:46.277 --> 00:37:48.699]  All these people at the top worship the same deal.
[00:37:50.319 --> 00:37:57.263]  How can it be that the same order of the Knights of Malta, the sovereign order of the Knights of Malta, can have members as extreme right?
[00:37:58.223 --> 00:38:05.809]  As Von Papen, and as Herman Goering, and then five minutes later, be initiating into their order, people on the left as Nelson Mandela.
[00:38:05.849 --> 00:38:08.371]  I got a question for people as to why that would be.
[00:38:08.431 --> 00:38:13.495]  They got to realize that behind the large doors, we said earlier, none of these distinctions on the street level mean a dam.
[00:38:13.815 --> 00:38:17.578]  This is an entire, you know, carnival, a dance macabre for people to get caught up in.
[00:38:18.059 --> 00:38:21.741]  You know, it just has no reality, and this is what people need to understand.
[00:38:21.801 --> 00:38:26.285]  If they study the symbolism long enough, if they track it through, and I've done like 30 years of research on this, so
[00:38:26.721 --> 00:38:30.145]  You know, this is the age in which this information is now finally coming to light.
[00:38:31.107 --> 00:38:40.719]  These guys, not only do they fully believe it in their own minds, some of these kings and queens, like Louis XVI of France, and various other potentates have designed entire cities!
[00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:46.384]  Based on Egyptian symbolism, to prove that they believe themselves as the Newborn Sun Kings and Sun Pharaohs.
[00:38:46.404 --> 00:38:48.645]  Yeah, that was the Sun King, and called himself the Sun King.
[00:38:48.685 --> 00:38:54.710]  And then we had Francois Mitterrand admitting that he was channeling Lucifer and going on mountaintops to pray.
[00:38:54.730 --> 00:39:06.918]  Then they had the Japanese architect build a pyramid with 666 pieces of this gold-pink glass, and it has a black pyramid inside.
[00:39:06.938 --> 00:39:09.160]  I mean, this is all right out in the open.
[00:39:10.239 --> 00:39:10.619]  That's right.
[00:39:10.939 --> 00:39:12.200]  I never stop stressing, you see.
[00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:29.765]  I mean, even though I've written a lot on Ireland, you know, the second book in the volume is dedicated to Egypt to show exactly that it came from a specific time, from a specific individual, a specific cult, a specific warped version of solar cultism, you see, and how this continues alive.
[00:39:29.825 --> 00:39:33.046]  That is why there are so many obelisks in Rome and in Vatican City.
[00:39:33.499 --> 00:39:36.921]  That's why Rome has certain, you know, geomantic alignments that it does.
[00:39:37.281 --> 00:39:39.022]  Same thing applies to Washington, D.C.
[00:39:39.242 --> 00:39:41.783]  Same thing applies to Cologne, to Paris.
[00:39:41.803 --> 00:39:45.545]  They believe that they call in spiritual forces from another dimension.
[00:39:46.405 --> 00:39:48.426]  Now, again, whether you believe this or not, folks, the elite believe it.
[00:39:48.466 --> 00:39:51.548]  Explain the sacred architecture.
[00:39:52.628 --> 00:39:53.209]  Well, that's right.
[00:39:53.289 --> 00:39:58.611]  And within masonry, if you look at the highest degrees of masonry, they have that Judaic aspect that you were talking about.
[00:39:58.691 --> 00:39:59.692]  Knights of the Kadosh.
[00:40:00.112 --> 00:40:01.953]  Knights of the, you know, the secret.
[00:40:02.652 --> 00:40:05.334]  You know, all of these weird terminologies they've got right there.
[00:40:05.654 --> 00:40:07.735]  People can see this in the design of the cities.
[00:40:08.055 --> 00:40:12.138]  They can, you know, I have a huge collection of Masonic literature, so we're not making anything up.
[00:40:12.178 --> 00:40:13.418]  This is from the horse's mouth.
[00:40:13.438 --> 00:40:17.861]  You only need to go to the Albert Mackey's and to the actual Masonic encyclopedias.
[00:40:17.881 --> 00:40:20.122]  This is not hard to do, even though it takes a lot of time.
[00:40:20.443 --> 00:40:22.844]  But if people spend the time, you know, see, to peruse our works.
[00:40:23.274 --> 00:40:30.518]  And we put the stuff on DVD, we put it in books, so it's there for people who don't have the time to do all this research, to find out that America is not free.
[00:40:30.598 --> 00:40:39.904]  America has been colonized by the, you know, the royals and the pharaohs of old, and America was ostensibly meant to be the last bastion against these oligarchs, these imperialists.
[00:40:40.304 --> 00:40:47.008]  What the people need to understand, in an America context particularly, is that the imperialism is not gone away.
[00:40:47.309 --> 00:40:52.932]  The stuff that you're seeing now with, you know, the Amaro coming in, and the NAFTA, and the CAFTA, and the destruction of the American Constitution,
[00:40:53.243 --> 00:40:56.105]  This is a form of imperialism that has been insinuating... And take Ireland.
[00:40:56.305 --> 00:41:03.629]  Ireland says no to the Lisbon Treaty, EU expansion, and then they say, we don't care, we're going to bring it back up for another vote, or implement it by fiat.
[00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:08.132]  It's exactly the same way, you know, it's a mafioso situation.
[00:41:08.152 --> 00:41:09.833]  They'll never, this kind of...
[00:41:10.521 --> 00:41:12.802]  Vampire never goes away until it's invited across the globe.
[00:41:12.842 --> 00:41:27.931]  And going back to Egypt, we see it in the Old Testament and in the New, over and over again the Pharaoh would send out to the different slave groups he had and would kill a large portion of their children to keep the slaves at a lower population.
[00:41:28.491 --> 00:41:31.873]  You see the CPS today going out and kidnapping the children.
[00:41:31.893 --> 00:41:39.017]  It's all repeated and they figured out thousands of years ago, thousands of years B.C., how to control societies.
[00:41:40.365 --> 00:41:45.187]  And I want to highlight something you just said a few minutes ago about the kind of dark forces that they're in league with.
[00:41:45.627 --> 00:41:49.108]  Those dark... You know, again, if people don't understand it, that's too bad.
[00:41:49.168 --> 00:41:54.390]  But the fact is, these people do not act in just a material sphere of, you know, of influence.
[00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:56.811]  They are very much tied into something off-world.
[00:41:56.871 --> 00:41:59.472]  They're tied into other dark, angelic forces.
[00:42:00.032 --> 00:42:05.454]  And they have to offer up sacrifices on this planet to those beings that they're in league with.
[00:42:05.714 --> 00:42:09.595]  And that is what, in my view, is, you know, pretty much a lot of the child abduction
[00:42:10.094 --> 00:42:18.966]  The wars, the world wars that we've experienced, and just the general appetite, or not the appetite, but the general, every day, the toxic, you know...
[00:42:20.046 --> 00:42:23.688]  Influx of trauma across the TV, you see, and in our world in general.
[00:42:23.968 --> 00:42:44.098]  They need anxiety, they want to keep people, you know, crippled and... They are changing our neural pathways, showing us millions of simulated murders on TV, traumatizing us, where they now have university studies with the brainwaves, where the area of the brain associated with pleasure, even in quote, quote, mainstream people, is lighting up when they see simulated murders, torture, death.
[00:42:44.138 --> 00:42:46.759]  They are turning us psychically into them.
[00:42:47.873 --> 00:42:55.837]  I couldn't agree more, Alex, and you know, it's a situation of the normal, lower-level sadomasochism that people have multiplied infinitely.
[00:42:56.237 --> 00:43:05.582]  This constant appeal to the limbic and mammalian centers of the brain, you know, and it's a diet, and a diet until you get so used to it that you don't even know what reason is anymore.
[00:43:05.622 --> 00:43:07.103]  You can't critically look at anything.
[00:43:07.383 --> 00:43:16.328]  You have an immediate defense mechanism as soon as they, you know, it's like most of these people that today you have the Internet riddled with Internet assassins and debunkers, so-called, quote-unquote,
[00:43:16.641 --> 00:43:24.405]  And these are people that I describe like the deer in the headlights of the oncoming truth movement who cannot stand that oncoming juggernaut of truth.
[00:43:24.425 --> 00:43:34.931]  And that's the next issue, is the enemy knows throughout history the human spirit rebels, goodness, the light literally blots out their black sunshine as they call it.
[00:43:35.291 --> 00:43:56.664]  And so they're doing everything they can with chemicals and microwaves and frequency pollution and radiation openly, and they write all this in their own documents that we've covered, and we cover in Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, to pollute our minds with the images, the toxins, all of it overlaid, you know, the brainwashing of the television, both semantically and with the frequency of it, to try to blind us.
[00:43:57.464 --> 00:44:00.026]  And I've seen them go from arrogant to now being fearful.
[00:44:00.386 --> 00:44:01.947]  What are they so afraid of, Michael?
[00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:08.844]  Well, they're always afraid of the human race because this is the serf, you know, that they've been able to enslave.
[00:44:08.984 --> 00:44:20.832]  And of course, the big fear is that that, you know, that particular indentured servant, slave, might in fact wake up and throw away, you know, all of the junk that, you know, basically an age of awakening is what they're fearful of.
[00:44:21.352 --> 00:44:31.959]  Anyone who has control that's surreptitious, anyone who has a catalog of criminality like they have, these are super criminals, mega criminals, the genocides, the colonializations, the war on consciousness,
[00:44:32.369 --> 00:44:39.282]  You know, all the devastation they've wreaked, of course these are criminals who don't want, you know, to be discovered or the light to be shone on them.
[00:44:39.362 --> 00:44:40.725]  I've often said in my work that, hey,
[00:44:41.144 --> 00:44:43.085]  These guys say that they're worshippers of the sun.
[00:44:43.365 --> 00:44:44.405]  They claim to worship light.
[00:44:44.665 --> 00:44:45.426]  Well, what happened to them?
[00:44:45.466 --> 00:44:49.247]  Let's see the effects on them when we turn the light of truth and knowledge onto them.
[00:44:49.327 --> 00:44:50.107]  See how they like it.
[00:44:50.608 --> 00:44:54.729]  Well, Revelation says they traffic in the souls of men.
[00:44:55.109 --> 00:45:00.631]  That's really what's valuable to them, is blinders, shutting people down, darkness, destruction.
[00:45:00.651 --> 00:45:02.192]  Look at the artwork the elite buys.
[00:45:02.592 --> 00:45:04.913]  Buckets of maggots, images of dead babies.
[00:45:05.453 --> 00:45:09.476]  I mean, this is the most popular art across the board worldwide with the elites.
[00:45:09.816 --> 00:45:14.919]  You know, 100 million pounds, sometimes 200 million dollars for one piece of blasphemous art.
[00:45:15.159 --> 00:45:22.204]  And they say, we're buying this art to worship it, to adulate it, to give it the support it deserves.
[00:45:22.244 --> 00:45:23.885]  So, what is their master plan?
[00:45:23.925 --> 00:45:27.247]  If they were to win, what is the world they're trying to set up?
[00:45:27.548 --> 00:45:30.309]  Let's get into the technological enslavement.
[00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:32.511]  They're not trying to set it up, they've already been doing it.
[00:45:32.831 --> 00:45:44.256]  As I said before, this imperialist movement of this juggernaut, we're only seeing the latter days of something that has been a continuous, ongoing, incremental movement, you know, down through history.
[00:45:44.336 --> 00:45:45.936]  Americans tend to, you know, not see that.
[00:45:45.976 --> 00:45:49.498]  They don't see, you know, the whole movement of... Well, Michael, I see it.
[00:45:49.518 --> 00:45:50.878]  I'm talking about their endgame.
[00:45:50.918 --> 00:45:52.599]  They're gearing up for something big.
[00:45:53.719 --> 00:45:58.541]  Well, I believe it's basically... This ties into my work on 2012 and what's coming there.
[00:45:58.581 --> 00:45:59.662]  It's a sort of a zero hour.
[00:46:00.102 --> 00:46:02.383]  This is the death of anything human.
[00:46:02.805 --> 00:46:04.087]  It doesn't mean the death of the planet.
[00:46:04.247 --> 00:46:06.590]  It doesn't mean, you know, the end of nature.
[00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:09.994]  It doesn't even necessarily mean the end of the world.
[00:46:10.114 --> 00:46:16.743]  What it means is that the end, and by God, anyone with their eyes open can see it's already taken place, it's a countdown to the extinction.
[00:46:17.259 --> 00:46:19.781]  Of what we would use when we say the word human.
[00:46:20.081 --> 00:46:24.804]  What we will have after 2012, 2015, you see, is a post-human world.
[00:46:25.104 --> 00:46:35.892]  They're racing headlong, you've dealt with it, and then... And all their futurists, all their futurists, they are saying that they will have it by 2012 to 2020, if it's Kurzweil.
[00:46:36.552 --> 00:46:41.255]  You're right, they are incrementally now, but accelerating it, turning all the systems on.
[00:46:42.396 --> 00:46:45.238]  Well, remember, what they're going to turn on happens
[00:46:46.212 --> 00:46:47.372]  2012 and post.
[00:46:47.973 --> 00:46:52.134]  Before you can turn something on, you gotta end, or bring to an end, that which was before.
[00:46:52.394 --> 00:47:02.417]  So all the idioms, all the customs, the traditions, that all the people of the world, especially of the western world, because the western world is now, as you see, being turned into a third world country, and the third world's rising to be a first world.
[00:47:02.897 --> 00:47:09.459]  What we're heading towards right now is basically a post-human dystopia, in which man is either so reduced to a robotic level,
[00:47:09.963 --> 00:47:26.712]  That he runs even more headlong into the pharmaceutical thing, the drug, and to escape himself, or it will literally be some sort of Blade Runner dystopia in which you are literally, you know, going to be vaccinated in a way that would change your, you know, being, or mess with our DNA.
[00:47:26.752 --> 00:47:35.216]  And by the way, 20 years ago they had live viruses and now they're advertising them that go in and create lobotomies in key areas of the brain.
[00:47:35.256 --> 00:47:38.058]  The viruses attack specific brain tissues
[00:47:38.818 --> 00:47:42.119]  Well, I believe, if you also bring in the whole concept of the GMOs,
[00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:10.525]  You start to discover that the hoarding of the actual organic seeds that nature has produced, they're siloing this, they're archiving it.
[00:48:10.685 --> 00:48:11.786]  Doomsday Vaults.
[00:48:12.646 --> 00:48:12.967]  What's that?
[00:48:13.207 --> 00:48:18.050]  They've created Doomsday Vaults, the Rockefellers and the UN have, because they're going to infect everything.
[00:48:19.091 --> 00:48:20.012]  Right, exactly.
[00:48:20.072 --> 00:48:27.137]  My vision is that they may, in fact, unleash some sort of worldwide plague on the plant life, on the flora.
[00:48:27.757 --> 00:48:32.821]  And then this creates us to either be interned underground or in some sort of silo or dome situation.
[00:48:33.194 --> 00:48:39.115]  In which only the privileged are given the right kind of food, etc., etc., and that person has to be totally conformist.
[00:48:39.415 --> 00:48:42.256]  They either wipe out everybody else... No, that, I mean, let me stop you, Michael.
[00:48:42.316 --> 00:48:44.416]  This is the stated reverse-engineered plan.
[00:48:44.696 --> 00:48:52.578]  They state, you know, that they have black op wars, they have drug wars to build up the police, and they stage terror to expand the criminal control grid.
[00:48:52.858 --> 00:48:56.539]  Then they have smaller controlled bioweapon releases to get us into compact cities.
[00:48:56.819 --> 00:48:59.480]  Then they start the real mass exterminations.
[00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:00.960]  That is the stated plan.
[00:49:02.401 --> 00:49:03.121]  I agree with you there.
[00:49:03.861 --> 00:49:10.483]  I absolutely have come to the same conclusions in my own work, that something along these lines is... People are hearing us now thinking we're talking sci-fi.
[00:49:10.824 --> 00:49:12.084]  This is already happening.
[00:49:12.524 --> 00:49:15.625]  The Monsanto and the GMO is all behind us.
[00:49:15.665 --> 00:49:16.585]  There's something going on.
[00:49:16.965 --> 00:49:22.687]  And it ties back to what we said about the inability to be able to control masses of people through the gun-to-the-head system.
[00:49:22.727 --> 00:49:23.547]  That has been tried.
[00:49:23.587 --> 00:49:24.188]  It doesn't work.
[00:49:24.568 --> 00:49:28.589]  The next kind of colonialism that we're going to experience, the next kind of imperialism, is going to be a genetic one.
[00:49:29.284 --> 00:49:32.347]  You know, we deal with this in the Architects of Control DVD.
[00:49:33.368 --> 00:49:35.190]  That DVD covers a lot of ground, actually.
[00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:40.134]  And it also goes into the psychological question of why people lend themselves to this kind of submission.
[00:49:40.214 --> 00:49:41.355]  I don't know if we have time to talk about it.
[00:49:41.395 --> 00:49:42.096]  No, no, we will.
[00:49:42.156 --> 00:49:43.117]  We have plenty of time.
[00:49:43.137 --> 00:49:44.038]  We're going to have you back soon.
[00:49:44.078 --> 00:49:46.460]  We have a whole other hour and ten minutes coming up.
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:53.707]  But the point you're making, Monsanto said in 99, in a public speech, it was in major papers, that they plan to infect everything
[00:49:54.227 --> 00:49:55.707]  So that then no one has a choice.
[00:49:56.087 --> 00:50:03.329]  They admit that this is meant to take over the entire biosphere, and with the Terminator genes and others, end the regular life cycle.
[00:50:03.349 --> 00:50:16.852]  The carbon tax is meant to be a tax on humans, to literally say that humans are bad, with this new guild of millions per country of environmental enforcers, one-child policy, all of this.
[00:50:16.872 --> 00:50:18.232]  I mean, I don't think the public understands.
[00:50:18.512 --> 00:50:22.433]  Hitler, Stalin, Mao, that was only warm-up for what they're getting ready to do.
[00:50:23.479 --> 00:50:24.719]  Well, that's my main point.
[00:50:24.779 --> 00:50:25.279]  It's warm-up.
[00:50:25.299 --> 00:50:27.900]  What we're seeing now is just the preliminary tip of the iceberg.
[00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:28.740]  You know?
[00:50:29.321 --> 00:50:46.665]  Now, this, uh... The Architects of Control DVD is actually dedicated to Jim Keith, and to also Ezra Pound, and these are two people that have a big impact on me, because Jim Keith was always looking, and I know you do as well, at this whole technological leviathan, which is one of the greatest clubs in the hands of the elite.
[00:50:46.905 --> 00:50:48.806]  Stay there, stay there, Michael Tesarian.
[00:50:48.826 --> 00:50:50.246]  We're gonna talk behind the scenes as well now.
[00:50:52.247 --> 00:50:57.370]  Okay, Michael, just to be clear, because you talked about only having an hour, you know you're on with us for a whole other hour, correct?
[00:50:57.811 --> 00:50:58.291]  Yeah, thanks.
[00:50:58.591 --> 00:50:59.051]  Okay, good.
[00:50:59.792 --> 00:51:11.980]  We're on the internet right now, we can skip this break right now, but I don't want to get into any of the main subject you're going to be covering, because I want to share all this with everybody out there on the AM and FM shortwave satellite and the rest of it.
[00:51:14.881 --> 00:51:17.502]  And I keep jumping in because I just want to back up everything you're saying.
[00:51:18.223 --> 00:51:26.366]  I think we need to reach out, like you said 40 minutes ago, to the minions of this, the mid-level servants, who believe the utopia they're being sold.
[00:51:26.526 --> 00:51:29.187]  Most of them, I don't think, understand they're not going to be part of this.
[00:51:29.568 --> 00:51:38.011]  But then on the other side, you have the nihilistic scientists, who I notice are clustered all around bioweapons labs and biology departments, like Eric Pionka.
[00:51:38.412 --> 00:51:40.593]  And the issue is, he says, kill 90% of us now.
[00:51:40.653 --> 00:51:41.493]  They're born Ebola.
[00:51:41.753 --> 00:51:43.154]  He can't wait for his own family to die.
[00:51:44.054 --> 00:51:46.215]  And we even got the FBI to go out and talk to him.
[00:51:46.235 --> 00:51:53.076]  The point is, he gets a 95% standing ovation with the scientists crying when he talks about how everyone's going to be killed.
[00:51:53.316 --> 00:51:56.977]  And then his graduate students send me threatening letters saying, look, he's not extreme.
[00:51:57.277 --> 00:51:59.158]  Most of us believe everyone should be killed.
[00:51:59.398 --> 00:52:03.519]  And you Google the person's name and there they are in a white lab coat working at a bioweapons lab.
[00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:09.523]  The point is, when they make a movie like Thirteen Monkeys, they're not playing games, folks.
[00:52:10.064 --> 00:52:12.345]  Just like we told you about the economic stuff that was going to happen.
[00:52:12.926 --> 00:52:16.409]  Just like I told you about government-sponsored terrorism that was coming and then it happened.
[00:52:16.749 --> 00:52:22.473]  Believe me, all we're doing is opening up the TV Guide and telling you what the enemy says they're going to do.
[00:52:22.493 --> 00:52:25.676]  This is in white papers, this is in UN Biological Diversity Assessments.
[00:52:26.076 --> 00:52:28.978]  This is the stated operation.
[00:52:29.739 --> 00:52:30.980]  So when we come back, I want to get into that.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.201]  But just briefly, behind the scenes,
[00:52:33.174 --> 00:52:51.363]  They're not all-powerful, they're not invincible, just like in the fake French Revolution, the Illuminati Revolution, they tried to go to a 10-day work week, they tried to change the calendar, change the clocks, they tried to destroy everything that had previously been there and remake it, but that failed.
[00:52:51.883 --> 00:52:57.106]  And I know they now have high-tech systems, but I don't see them, I don't see their program being on schedule, Michael.
[00:52:58.703 --> 00:53:00.384]  Well, of course, that's what happened in 2000.
[00:53:00.764 --> 00:53:02.384]  Everyone thought they were going to cap the pyramid.
[00:53:02.404 --> 00:53:03.545]  You know, it was all going to happen then.
[00:53:04.045 --> 00:53:05.205]  And, you know, they have delays.
[00:53:05.265 --> 00:53:06.926]  They even have dynastic rivalries.
[00:53:07.286 --> 00:53:10.968]  They've got... When you're building a New World Order, you know, you have to also feed the dogs.
[00:53:11.328 --> 00:53:23.632]  What's been happening in the last 10 years, especially even with Iraq and Iran, and what they're wanting to do is... This doesn't... These kinds of territorial urges and the fight for oil does not bother the people who are orchestrating this at the top of the pyramid.
[00:53:23.992 --> 00:53:25.693]  That's just the stuff of the oily rags.
[00:53:26.073 --> 00:53:26.454]  We're good to go.
[00:53:37.043 --> 00:53:38.624]  Is the feeding of the monkey.
[00:53:38.904 --> 00:53:48.832]  You've got to feed the... Well, also, it's important to demonize America and have all of this heaped on us to discredit free market capitalism, which it isn't.
[00:53:49.092 --> 00:53:55.737]  So we have to be made the bad guys so the new monopolar New World Order can rise up out of Europe.
[00:53:55.757 --> 00:53:56.057]  Here we go.
[00:54:03.223 --> 00:54:04.945]  Michael Desarian is our guest.
[00:54:04.965 --> 00:54:06.426]  MichaelDesarian.com's website.
[00:54:06.466 --> 00:54:09.509]  Link up on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:54:11.151 --> 00:54:14.854]  It's hard to believe, but in my film, Endgame, we only show you the tip of the iceberg.
[00:54:15.876 --> 00:54:17.317]  About who these global controllers are.
[00:54:17.337 --> 00:54:19.678]  I mean, how do you get scientists in the U.S.
[00:54:19.738 --> 00:54:26.121]  and Russia and everywhere to go nerve gas little children or test radiation on children and kill them or test it on troops?
[00:54:26.441 --> 00:54:27.922]  That isn't about testing the nerve gas.
[00:54:27.942 --> 00:54:29.563]  They know it'll kill a person or the radiation.
[00:54:29.843 --> 00:54:42.689]  It's about creating cadres of scientists who will buy into this and who enjoy exercising the psychopathic power to create larger cadres of subunits to serve the New World Order going into the mass extermination.
[00:54:43.109 --> 00:54:56.617]  And I want you to know, they're going to claim Al Qaeda did it, or claim it came out of a lab, but when you and your family are dying, especially you police out there, you can at least, you know, realize that for those that survive, that the New World Order is real, and that this really happened, and that we really warned you.
[00:54:56.878 --> 00:54:59.499]  We were talking during the break about them not capping the pyramid in 2000.
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:07.624]  As they were openly worshipping what they called anti-beast, or anemon, and you were just talking about that.
[00:55:07.924 --> 00:55:27.236]  It was on worldwide TV, fake fire shooting out of the ground, fireworks, huge horned demons marching on movie screens at the Giza Plateau, worldwide occultism, PBS carried it, open Lucifer worship on TV, and it was like I would mention it to people and no one even seemed to care.
[00:55:27.296 --> 00:55:27.977]  Michael DeSarian?
[00:55:29.130 --> 00:55:29.991]  Well, exactly right.
[00:55:30.071 --> 00:55:38.518]  And people have to realize that these guys, on the highest level, you see, they operate based on an old, stellar form of timing, based on ancient zodiacs.
[00:55:38.819 --> 00:55:42.382]  The whole concept of that when you do something, the timing has to be right.
[00:55:42.862 --> 00:55:48.207]  This I discovered in the context of Ireland when I was studying things like the, you know, the various battles.
[00:55:48.367 --> 00:55:54.213]  I mean, the very fact that the Orange Parade happens, you know, very close to midsummer, the midsummer solstice, just like your bohemian
[00:55:55.345 --> 00:55:58.587]  Uh, Grove Investigation pointed out that the dates are very important.
[00:55:58.607 --> 00:56:00.468]  The midsummer, the summer solstice.
[00:56:00.828 --> 00:56:09.193]  We have the same issue happening in Northern Ireland, where the 12th of July parades are scheduled for the movement of the sun, you know, to the mid, to the center point there.
[00:56:09.213 --> 00:56:16.097]  Uh, the, uh, Black Perceptory, which is a very secret order behind the Orange Lodge, they have their ceremonies on July 13th.
[00:56:16.518 --> 00:56:18.759]  This ritualistic element is very, very important.
[00:56:19.099 --> 00:56:23.722]  People will notice that the declarations of war, whether it's March 17th, the Feast of Purim,
[00:56:24.215 --> 00:56:26.197]  You see, or any other date that comes about.
[00:56:26.237 --> 00:56:27.058]  It's not random.
[00:56:27.118 --> 00:56:28.940]  It is not done by accident.
[00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:41.051]  And so the openings of this, the closings of that, the signing of the Eurodollar, you know, all the things that the MEPs do, or the people who control them do, is done based on ancient solar and stellar and lunar zodiacs.
[00:56:41.091 --> 00:56:42.213]  People have to understand this.
[00:56:42.773 --> 00:56:44.415]  It's based on ancient Masonic timings.
[00:56:44.952 --> 00:57:01.577]  You know, we've got to understand... And by the way, that comes out in mainstream media, that, oh, Tony Blair every morning is possessed by the spirit of the light, he falls on the ground and convulses, he goes to the four corners of the earth to do weird rituals, oh, and Ronald Reagan, everything he does is according to the astrology, and, you know, this all comes out.
[00:57:03.018 --> 00:57:12.221]  Exactly, and that's the reason why my life took me into those areas, to study these secret societies quite intimately, to definitely get into these occult areas, to find out what it is that they're up to,
[00:57:12.731 --> 00:57:13.332]  What are they doing?
[00:57:13.432 --> 00:57:19.777]  And then basically to pull back from the canvas and discover, my God, this is a worldwide ritual that involves many, many tentacles.
[00:57:20.057 --> 00:57:29.865]  But getting back to the point about this whole technotronic age, you know, as I said, my work is dedicated to Jim Keith, and I want people to remember his name because he's one of the greatest American researchers you could imagine.
[00:57:29.885 --> 00:57:30.965]  Do you believe he was murdered?
[00:57:32.166 --> 00:57:33.367]  Absolutely, no doubt in my mind.
[00:57:33.407 --> 00:57:35.609]  And the people closest to him also speculate upon that.
[00:57:35.909 --> 00:57:38.932]  Well, then his publisher died mysteriously right after he did.
[00:57:40.209 --> 00:57:40.949]  Yes, exactly.
[00:57:40.969 --> 00:57:44.651]  And another friend of his, a co-researcher, was also mysteriously killed.
[00:57:45.031 --> 00:57:48.833]  So there's no doubt in my mind that they either, you know, they took this guy out because he was so special.
[00:57:48.853 --> 00:57:51.194]  He had the ability and the charm to reach many, many people.
[00:57:51.214 --> 00:57:53.275]  Well, he also got wide-spectrum analysis.
[00:57:54.675 --> 00:57:54.856]  Yeah.
[00:57:54.916 --> 00:57:56.496]  I mean, he really got the big picture.
[00:57:57.417 --> 00:57:58.917]  Well, remember, these guys were tied up.
[00:57:59.398 --> 00:58:04.480]  Jim had investigated Scientology and did a runner from it because he knew, my God, what the hell is going on here.
[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:09.282]  And then tried to whistle-blow that, and from there, you know, went on to, like I did in my own way,
[00:58:09.781 --> 00:58:13.906]  To, you know, branch out and to find out about the world, the great global conspiracy.
[00:58:13.926 --> 00:58:15.187]  And his work is fundamental.
[00:58:15.227 --> 00:58:22.836]  His book, Mass Control, you know, is an essential part of the DVD we're doing right now, but to release next month, or very shortly.
[00:58:23.316 --> 00:58:24.217]  And this goes into his work.
[00:58:24.278 --> 00:58:25.139]  It's dedicated to his work.
[00:58:25.239 --> 00:58:26.921]  And people have got to understand... All right, stay there.
[00:58:26.941 --> 00:58:28.182]  We're going to break for one minute.
[00:58:28.222 --> 00:58:29.143]  Come back with the next hour.
[00:58:29.223 --> 00:58:30.465]  Michael Dasarian getting into this.
[00:58:33.735 --> 00:58:34.956]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:35.016 --> 00:58:36.656]  Alright, let me go ahead and talk to him now.
[00:58:36.676 --> 00:58:38.297]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:38.757 --> 00:58:46.181]  And from there, you know, went on to, like I did in my own way, to, you know, branch out and to find out about the world, the great global conspiracy.
[00:58:46.221 --> 00:58:47.461]  And his work is fundamental.
[00:58:47.501 --> 00:58:55.104]  His book, Mass Control, you know, is an essential part of the DVD we're doing right now, about to release next month, or very shortly.
[00:58:55.605 --> 00:58:59.246]  And this goes into his work, it's dedicated to his work, and people have got to understand... Alright, stay there.
[00:58:59.266 --> 00:59:00.507]  We're going to break for one minute.
[00:59:00.547 --> 00:59:01.467]  Come back with the next hour.
[00:59:01.567 --> 00:59:02.768]  Michael Lassarian getting into this.
[00:59:06.010 --> 00:59:08.491]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:59:08.511 --> 00:59:13.394]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:59:14.414 --> 00:59:15.795]  It is a big idea.
[00:59:15.815 --> 00:59:17.936]  A new world order.
[00:59:18.636 --> 00:59:22.658]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:59:22.678 --> 00:59:26.340]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:28.581]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:59:29.162 --> 00:59:31.543]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:59:32.325 --> 00:59:39.751]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:59:42.693 --> 00:59:47.657]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:59:48.137 --> 00:59:51.540]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:59:57.768 --> 01:00:01.071]  My websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:00:01.271 --> 01:00:07.716]  InfoWars.net, PrisonPlanet.tv, JonesReport.com, TruthNews.us are some of the alternate auxiliary sites.
[01:00:08.076 --> 01:00:10.358]  They have some exclusive news that's only on those sites.
[01:00:11.019 --> 01:00:16.383]  But the big main sites that are updated three or four times a day are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:00:18.847 --> 01:00:28.839]  Michael, I want to get into a little bit of positive news first, then I want to get into the technological control grid, the enslavement grid, what your new film's about, that was the bad news, but knowing the enemy is at the battle.
[01:00:30.001 --> 01:00:34.746]  But you talk and speak a lot about the exponential awakening, and listen, I tend to
[01:00:36.272 --> 01:00:42.096]  Underestimate how many people I reach individually, and I'm just one, you know, little outpost in all of this.
[01:00:42.516 --> 01:00:56.985]  I don't over-gauge myself, but really, it doesn't matter any guest I call up now, some engineer, or Chuck Norris, or, you know, some politician, or somebody in another country, or I go to foreign countries, people all over the street come up to me now.
[01:00:57.325 --> 01:01:02.569]  You know, I go to Honduras, or I go to England, or I go to Germany, or I go to, you know, some other part of the world,
[01:01:05.130 --> 01:01:06.491]  I'm one little guy in all this.
[01:01:08.512 --> 01:01:10.372]  Take Austin, my center of operations.
[01:01:10.773 --> 01:01:17.396]  It's now where I'll be at the gym and 80% of the people in there come up and aren't just coming up saying hi, they're waking up, they're listening.
[01:01:18.296 --> 01:01:22.038]  And so I see with my own life an exponential explosion
[01:01:22.458 --> 01:01:25.861]  Well, I agree with that totally, otherwise I wouldn't be doing my work.
[01:01:25.881 --> 01:01:33.786]  It is one of the things I also, everything you said is true for me as well, wherever I go, the enormous amount of emails and feedback that I get
[01:01:48.706 --> 01:01:56.449]  You know, and even the negative reaction, at least that shows me that this juggernaut, as I said, the lights, you know, must be blinding some people.
[01:01:56.789 --> 01:02:03.772]  That gives you the reverse understanding that, you know, it must be happening because look at even the reactions it's causing, even in a negative way to people.
[01:02:04.052 --> 01:02:10.034]  You must know that by their threat, you can also tell, you know, by their backlashing, you can tell, my God, you know, our time has come.
[01:02:10.494 --> 01:02:14.496]  And I always describe it as being that people have to stay very optimistic what's happening.
[01:02:14.536 --> 01:02:15.016]  This can
[01:02:16.129 --> 01:02:23.732]  I am not a person who ever believes that evil will ever triumph in the world, because just like nature abhors a vacuum, nature also abhors that which is evil.
[01:02:23.852 --> 01:02:31.615]  And if you are evil, if you're operating from that mindset, you've actually just raised a red flag to the powers of nature to say, come and get me, wipe me out.
[01:02:32.155 --> 01:02:38.517]  And I also believe that we are in the time of the death throes of this kind of sphere of activity.
[01:02:38.942 --> 01:02:40.123]  This kind of imperialism.
[01:02:40.403 --> 01:02:41.723]  We're actually... It's bad.
[01:02:41.783 --> 01:02:42.183]  It's hot.
[01:02:42.343 --> 01:02:42.583]  Yep.
[01:02:42.624 --> 01:02:43.644]  They're up in our face.
[01:02:43.944 --> 01:02:49.666]  But as a matter of fact, I also believe you see that it's a situation in which these individuals, it's their dying days.
[01:02:49.706 --> 01:02:52.227]  They're in the last phase of the tyranny.
[01:02:52.708 --> 01:02:56.629]  And that, you know, it's a situation that we're gonna, you know, overcome it.
[01:02:56.769 --> 01:03:03.472]  And it's just that I don't necessarily... See, I don't entertain any other idea at all because I wouldn't be wasting my time on five minutes.
[01:03:03.931 --> 01:03:13.277]  Of any of this research, if I didn't totally and utterly believe that good always triumphs over evil, and it will do, and that these people are evil, and my message is that we have to study the nature of evil.
[01:03:13.657 --> 01:03:17.500]  Yeah, a person can be good, but a person can also be good and stupid, or good and blind.
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:27.826]  The point is now that the awakening continues as we pass the torch from one person to the other, we get our arms around as much information as we can, we do not bicker because we have minute differences.
[01:03:28.127 --> 01:03:29.167]  We're all on camp here.
[01:03:29.207 --> 01:03:33.190]  I said this in one of my talks in Los Angeles, you know, we're all, we all have our tents
[01:03:33.635 --> 01:03:34.395]  We're good to go.
[01:03:58.559 --> 01:03:59.280]  Yes, we are.
[01:04:11.451 --> 01:04:16.417]  You know, the toothless piranhas that are stifling... Well, have you noticed they never give any proof either?
[01:04:16.878 --> 01:04:20.302]  You know, we're saying we're waking up, we're positive, we're affecting... I know.
[01:04:20.622 --> 01:04:25.288]  But people who are really doing it are waking people up, they're involved, they're saying, let's work together.
[01:04:25.608 --> 01:04:29.373]  But the enemy will attack you and then say, oh, we should work together, why aren't you working together?
[01:04:29.833 --> 01:04:32.334]  You know, they never... it's just unbelievable.
[01:04:32.554 --> 01:04:34.815]  But it's not just conscious enemy operatives.
[01:04:35.656 --> 01:04:45.981]  There are a lot of just broken down, morbid, malfunctioning minds out there that, you know, also have woken up to the New World Order, but still just thrash about attacking everyone.
[01:04:46.421 --> 01:04:48.122]  We're going to continue with Michael Tasarian.
[01:04:48.162 --> 01:04:49.683]  MichaelTasarian.com is his website.
[01:04:49.723 --> 01:04:50.163]  Stay with us.
[01:04:50.823 --> 01:04:51.724]  I'm going to skip this one, too.
[01:04:53.164 --> 01:04:55.205]  John, are you tired of hearing that... Yes, sir.
[01:04:55.265 --> 01:04:56.526]  I'm going to skip this break, too.
[01:04:57.853 --> 01:05:00.894]  Okay, Michael, we're going to skip this one, too, for the internet-only audience.
[01:05:01.314 --> 01:05:05.436]  When we come back, let's get into the control grid and a lot more.
[01:05:05.456 --> 01:05:07.397]  You said you had an address?
[01:05:08.337 --> 01:05:10.118]  Yeah, but we're on air at the end of the show.
[01:05:10.138 --> 01:05:11.938]  I'll just give you my address and I'd like to get your stuff.
[01:05:13.099 --> 01:05:16.960]  I've got several addresses and I don't want to give out my personal address on air.
[01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:19.561]  Yeah, yeah, okay, not on air, yeah.
[01:05:19.961 --> 01:05:24.603]  But, you know, you bring up the debunkers, and just while we're on the internet audience,
[01:05:26.095 --> 01:05:31.266]  It doesn't bother me that so many people attack me or manufacture all these things I've supposedly done.
[01:05:31.286 --> 01:05:34.393]  And I know they do that to you, I know.
[01:05:34.413 --> 01:05:35.676]  Excuse me.
[01:05:37.097 --> 01:05:40.199]  It's that I know that most of them actually aren't government agents.
[01:05:40.779 --> 01:05:43.420]  They are just products of the society.
[01:05:44.341 --> 01:05:47.042]  And it just blows me away where, I mean, here's an example.
[01:05:47.603 --> 01:05:51.545]  There's all these locals in Austin and they just keep claiming lies about me.
[01:05:51.645 --> 01:06:02.631]  I mean, they just keep saying I'm in their business, I'm doing things to them, I'm hurting them, and they call me up and say, you've done this and that, and I'm like, I don't even know what you're talking about.
[01:06:04.665 --> 01:06:14.909]  Well, exactly, and so then it builds a type of delusion, and we see that with the delusion of the fear of the Muslims, or delusion of the fear of this group, or that group.
[01:06:15.069 --> 01:06:20.652]  I mean, I think it's more of a spirit, or a program, a download, not even so much a government operation.
[01:06:20.712 --> 01:06:25.714]  Obviously, some of it is, and it's just so sad to see that...
[01:06:26.434 --> 01:06:26.674]  I agree.
[01:06:26.694 --> 01:06:28.256]  I've also tracked the same thing back to Envy.
[01:06:28.276 --> 01:06:34.901]  I agree wholeheartedly because I've given it so much thought, you know, since I became more publicly known, of course, then I had to address this particular backlashing issue.
[01:06:52.924 --> 01:06:54.026]  And I've tracked it to envy.
[01:06:54.046 --> 01:06:56.809]  I've tracked it to the fact that they are like the deer in the headlights.
[01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:59.954]  They're scared to lose, you know, what they think is their security.
[01:07:00.498 --> 01:07:02.879]  By getting into knowledge, because knowledge threatens you.
[01:07:02.919 --> 01:07:07.102]  Knowledge asks you to think more, to think again, to reevaluate everything you know.
[01:07:07.462 --> 01:07:11.524]  And this is, of course, extremely threatening to most people who've just, you know, felt, hey, good, I was just falling asleep.
[01:07:11.544 --> 01:07:14.325]  I was just rolling over there to go to sleep and have everything be secure.
[01:07:14.726 --> 01:07:21.389]  And now you guys come along and tell me about the Illuminati, or you tell me about, you know, what's waiting for me tomorrow in a dystopia if I don't get up and do something.
[01:07:22.129 --> 01:07:24.911]  You put doubt on me about my elected leaders and so forth and so on.
[01:07:25.231 --> 01:07:31.456]  You tell me to read, you tell me to study, you know, and this is a big threat to those people who are just so apathetic and narcissistic, so of course, you know, they backlash.
[01:07:31.816 --> 01:07:34.098]  I always take it as a positive sign, you know, in the last segment.
[01:07:34.118 --> 01:07:35.939]  Well, no, I agree with you.
[01:07:35.979 --> 01:07:38.561]  But I mean, I agree with you, but I'm saying people, we've even woken up.
[01:07:39.122 --> 01:07:43.265]  They'll admit I've woken them up, or you've woken them up, but then they'll still say, we're bad.
[01:07:43.305 --> 01:07:44.726]  Well, you judge a tree by its fruits.
[01:07:45.066 --> 01:07:49.410]  How do we wake up so many, but then we're bad, and then they manufacture
[01:07:49.890 --> 01:07:54.761]  All these crimes we've supposedly committed so that they have a rationalization to make up more crap about us.
[01:07:55.021 --> 01:07:55.462]  Here we go.
[01:07:57.306 --> 01:07:58.088]  Radio Network.
[01:07:59.386 --> 01:08:05.287]  Okay, we've got about 51 minutes left with Michael Tesarian, great researcher, michaeltesarian.com.
[01:08:05.827 --> 01:08:25.290]  Michael, break down the technological control grid, the microwave guns, the face scanning cameras, the poison in the food and water, all of it admitted, all of it being intensified, 1 in 33 having cancer, now 1 in 2 in men, 1 in 3 in women, you know, just, I mean, the plagues are upon us, it is engineered.
[01:08:27.151 --> 01:08:28.491]  Break down this grid.
[01:08:29.673 --> 01:08:44.376]  Well, like I said, coming out of the work of Jim Keith and the people who have more of a look at this technotronic world, and you even have some of the insiders talking about that they can't wait for this, people of the Bertrand Russell School, you see, and the whole Bread and Circus clan, the intellectual types.
[01:08:44.537 --> 01:08:47.697]  What I've been studying is more the elite type, the people at the top of the pyramid.
[01:08:48.337 --> 01:08:49.438]  What is their thinking?
[01:08:49.478 --> 01:08:50.078]  What do they want?
[01:08:50.138 --> 01:08:51.398]  How do they see mankind?
[01:08:51.418 --> 01:08:59.200]  You know, the people coming out of the Thomas Malthus School, the people coming out of the Frankfurt Schools and the Tavistock Institute, and these highbrows who have always looked at us
[01:08:59.631 --> 01:08:59.911]  I don't
[01:09:18.536 --> 01:09:29.884]  To look at our genes and to present the gene to us in a very subliminally negative way, as some sort of mechanical construct that is just, you know... It's dirty, it's broken, we're bad.
[01:09:29.904 --> 01:09:41.312]  And for those that don't know, they would, 2,000 years ago in Rome, breed large brutish, quote, dumb Germans, Gauls, and others, you know, together when the slaves were mainly white.
[01:09:41.832 --> 01:09:46.095]  And then it's openly in the slave manuals, very politically incorrect to say, but it's actually history.
[01:09:46.115 --> 01:09:53.420]  I'm not saying it worked, but they actually did also breed people in this country to be large and stupid according to what the official documents say.
[01:09:53.481 --> 01:09:53.801]  Go ahead.
[01:09:54.661 --> 01:09:55.062]  That's right.
[01:09:55.682 --> 01:09:56.403]  This is where they're at.
[01:09:56.423 --> 01:09:58.904]  This is what, you know, Jim Keith's work really alerted me to.
[01:09:58.924 --> 01:10:06.390]  The Dr. Delgados, these Frankensteinian, you know, Bela Lugosi creatures that, you know, haunt the technical world that have huge amount of funding.
[01:10:06.949 --> 01:10:30.537]  And what really caught my eye, because as I told you before, my introduction to a lot of this has been through art and through symbolism, I started to notice that the symbolism that these, you know, Alex DeGrasse and these individuals who are now behind the whole Genome Project, and many of the other technological sort of projects and organizations, right from the time of Francis Crick, doing his main research in the Templar zones of London, and then the first genetic experiments being done in the Templar areas of Scotland near Rosslyn,
[01:10:31.072 --> 01:10:37.960]  You know, this kind of stuff started to raise a red flag for me because here we're up against the Templar symbolism again.
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:40.162]  Here we're seeing the Holy Grail symbolism again.
[01:10:40.482 --> 01:10:42.565]  Here we're seeing the man in white with the red crosses.
[01:10:42.845 --> 01:10:43.486]  What is all of this?
[01:10:43.746 --> 01:10:45.027]  What has science got to do with any of this?
[01:10:45.247 --> 01:10:49.872]  So then I started tracking that and got into the work of Jim Keith and others who started talking about it.
[01:10:50.513 --> 01:10:54.055]  The assault on the human race has been on consciousness, but it's also been on biology.
[01:10:54.315 --> 01:11:13.205]  And anyone who stands up against the FDA, the AMA, any of the Dr. Raymond Royal-Rice, the Wilhelm Reich, the Walter Russells, you know, the Max Gersons, the list is endless of anyone who stands up to say, here's how real healing happens, here's how you get, you know, back to your center, both not only legal sovereignty in a social sense, but spiritual sovereignty.
[01:11:13.405 --> 01:11:19.468]  You know, they suppress and molest those people, they burn their works, they purge them, they do not let their knowledge be known.
[01:11:19.884 --> 01:11:28.473]  So, some of the attacks on the human beings, we have to understand the nature of evil and understand the Hydra that is not just attacking in one way.
[01:11:28.753 --> 01:11:34.619]  In fact, often, as Archibald Wavell the General said, watch what the right hand is doing because you're not seeing the left hand.
[01:11:34.979 --> 01:11:38.323]  They may present in front of you some sort of bugbear, some sort of, you know,
[01:11:39.502 --> 01:11:39.822]  What's it?
[01:11:39.922 --> 01:11:45.504]  It's like Wizard of Oz's shadow for you to be, you know, shaking in front of, but the real enemy is coming at you from the back.
[01:11:45.884 --> 01:11:53.126]  So, this is what I've also been studying, and I really do believe that this post-human world is upon us, whether they're going to... See, the global village is upon us.
[01:11:53.827 --> 01:12:00.989]  I mean, that comes out of my studies of Fabianism and studies of the common purpose and all of that, so... But the global village can be many things.
[01:12:01.573 --> 01:12:09.138]  They may not even put chains on you, they may not even build a wall around you, but you can still inhabit this planet as a global slave in the global village.
[01:12:09.178 --> 01:12:10.399]  There's many ways of attaining this.
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:18.185]  And through these RFI chips, the whole situation of the whole digital kingdom opening up for us, this is what's going at breakneck speed.
[01:12:18.601 --> 01:12:27.665]  Since they're sort of falling back of the main military budgets, not too much falling back on it, but as obviously they've scaled back from Star Wars and these other things, where do you think all that money is going?
[01:12:27.925 --> 01:12:41.470]  That money is now going into the whole technological world to create for human race, basically a cyber purgatory, which is going to be what supplants this ending that I've talked about in the next four to five years.
[01:12:41.770 --> 01:12:45.332]  You're going to see a sort of a countdown to extinction of all the traditions
[01:12:45.851 --> 01:12:53.896]  All the accepted norms that our forefathers worked for, that we've understood, that our grandparents and our parents, this is both an education, but specifically a medical.
[01:12:54.216 --> 01:12:57.057]  Just look at the way that children are medicated up their eyeballs right now.
[01:12:57.538 --> 01:13:09.604]  You know, I mean, the complete, there's even one slug from Stanford University, he wants to start introducing the anti, you know, the ADD,
[01:13:11.365 --> 01:13:11.685]  No, no, no.
[01:13:11.725 --> 01:13:15.968]  There's already drugging of children in utero if they quote, come from poor families in Oregon, which is eugenics.
[01:13:25.447 --> 01:13:26.448]  Right, exactly.
[01:13:26.468 --> 01:13:39.100]  This goes back to Mari Stokes, right back to the whole Fabian situation, you know, and back to the... And what it is, is these are really murderous, bloodthirsty control freaks who just have disdain and arrogance for everyone.
[01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:42.102]  And I've actually talked to some of these top scientists and elitists from these big families.
[01:13:43.023 --> 01:13:44.905]  They're almost mentally retarded in a way.
[01:13:44.945 --> 01:13:48.869]  They're gibbering, they're goblin-like, and they're not even that smart.
[01:13:48.889 --> 01:13:51.091]  They're just vicious, vicious little demons.
[01:13:52.145 --> 01:13:59.731]  Well, the more empty you are, the more fearful you are, the more that you need to exercise these controls.
[01:13:59.771 --> 01:14:02.113]  That is the Wizard of Oz shadow situation.
[01:14:02.133 --> 01:14:05.035]  People need to wake up, turn on the lights, and not be afraid of that type of thing.
[01:14:05.055 --> 01:14:08.718]  It ties into the awakening that you spoke of in the previous segment here.
[01:14:09.219 --> 01:14:09.919]  And that is happening.
[01:14:09.979 --> 01:14:11.100]  It needs to continue to happen.
[01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:13.242]  And as I say, I'm very adamant of people
[01:14:13.909 --> 01:14:15.590]  Do not territorialize this knowledge.
[01:14:15.690 --> 01:14:18.950]  First of all, this is an alternative subject that we deal with.
[01:14:19.250 --> 01:14:20.091]  It is not mainstream.
[01:14:20.131 --> 01:14:21.331]  It is not fundamentalistic.
[01:14:21.351 --> 01:14:22.691]  You're not going to territorialize it.
[01:14:22.731 --> 01:14:23.772]  It does not belong to you.
[01:14:24.112 --> 01:14:30.013]  It is knowledge, and you cannot bring the same old world, you know, paradigms of own and control into this area.
[01:14:30.053 --> 01:14:30.874]  You don't belong.
[01:14:30.934 --> 01:14:31.594]  Go and study.
[01:14:31.634 --> 01:14:34.915]  Go back to school, you know, and go back into the orthodox world, is my message to those people.
[01:14:34.935 --> 01:14:39.656]  Yeah, I've noticed people always try to... I noticed people always, in our own, you know, quote,
[01:14:40.393 --> 01:14:45.117]  You know, awakening movement, reality movement, whatever you want to call it.
[01:14:45.137 --> 01:14:55.007]  They always try to territorialize it about who said when 9-11 was going to happen first, or who discovered this, or who discovered that.
[01:14:55.507 --> 01:15:04.309]  And me, I'm always happy to have folks on, give them credit, but I do that almost neurotically just to please those that are keeping score on who came up with this or who thought of this first.
[01:15:04.349 --> 01:15:08.711]  I mean, I have trailblazed thousands of things, coined terms, but it means nothing to me.
[01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:10.611]  I'm hoping people use it.
[01:15:10.711 --> 01:15:16.993]  I'm hoping people expand on my knowledge as I expanded on others, stand on my shoulders as I stood on others.
[01:15:17.033 --> 01:15:22.074]  But you're right, there's this obsession with territorializing, and I've done the opposite.
[01:15:22.094 --> 01:15:24.215]  I've said, make copies of my films, do whatever you want.
[01:15:25.356 --> 01:15:26.177]  Use my material.
[01:15:26.257 --> 01:15:27.337]  Don't even give me credit.
[01:15:27.878 --> 01:15:29.219]  Because it's about survival.
[01:15:30.199 --> 01:15:37.884]  Again, people can wake up to the New World Order, but they haven't woken up to all the conditioning they were already under, and so they've got to break that as well.
[01:15:39.245 --> 01:15:47.931]  Well, they're walking towards... See, the word utopia, if you actually look up the meaning of the word utopia as it was first meant to mean, it actually means no place.
[01:15:48.584 --> 01:15:53.968]  And this of course then opened up, this would not have been understood when Francis Bacon, you know, coined the term or used it.
[01:15:54.348 --> 01:16:00.533]  It certainly makes a lot of sense now because we have virtual kingdoms, we have cyber, you know, purgatories are waiting for us.
[01:16:00.613 --> 01:16:10.681]  We have these virtual reality states in which man, so divorced from his own center, so divorced from his own spirit, not only divorced but running headlong away in the opposite direction from his spirit.
[01:16:11.081 --> 01:16:12.462]  What do you think is waiting there for him?
[01:16:14.003 --> 01:16:19.728]  These individuals are wanting to create a perfect social global village in which you can upload your own consciousness.
[01:16:19.848 --> 01:16:21.869]  The internet is one aspect of this.
[01:16:21.929 --> 01:16:25.732]  It's not negative, but it's an extension of the cerebral spinal system, as many scholars have shown.
[01:16:26.073 --> 01:16:32.698]  The point is, is the way they're engineering the technocracy is to dominate and subjugate and dumb down.
[01:16:33.098 --> 01:16:39.323]  So we're not demonizing technology one way or the other, but the architecture of it has been designed for bad.
[01:16:39.363 --> 01:16:49.150]  There is no doubting that, and we're being inserted into the false reality when our whole development is about this plane of existence, and we need to maintain that.
[01:16:49.871 --> 01:16:58.998]  We can certainly expand, but we need to maintain and expand our core, not give up our core of who we are to, quote, expand into something else, because that will destroy who we really are.
[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:08.402]  Right, and we often, because again of the misuse of terms, because of the media's complicity in all of this, we often think of technology as being nothing to do with spirituality.
[01:17:08.502 --> 01:17:11.282]  In fact, spirit and technology are two words for the same thing.
[01:17:11.702 --> 01:17:19.484]  If you go back in history and you'll notice the emphasis of technology when it's used to write, to build pyramids, to feed the poor, you see, to irrigate great rivers.
[01:17:19.504 --> 01:17:23.785]  I mean, technology was in the hands of all of the most spiritual people in the past.
[01:17:24.187 --> 01:17:30.150]  It's being sequestered, it's being repackaged, it's being sort of territorialized and owned by those who are the darkest of powers.
[01:17:30.170 --> 01:17:31.111]  It doesn't belong to them.
[01:17:31.471 --> 01:17:40.076]  The great samurai, you know, the people who could make the great swords in the past, the great horsemen, or the great, you know, whatever, the musicians, the musicology, the creators of instruments.
[01:17:40.649 --> 01:17:42.151]  You know, all of this is technology, isn't it?
[01:17:42.451 --> 01:17:44.653]  So technology surrounds us as part of who we are.
[01:17:45.113 --> 01:17:46.735]  But it also has a spiritual component.
[01:17:46.795 --> 01:17:53.762]  It needs to be back in the hands of the people who are spiritual, not in the hands of these demonic people who are using it to, you know, destroy humanity.
[01:17:53.782 --> 01:17:54.082]  That's right.
[01:17:54.122 --> 01:17:56.665]  We are a species who envisions and then creates.
[01:17:57.225 --> 01:18:00.950]  We are a magical species compared to everything else on this planet.
[01:18:01.270 --> 01:18:04.474]  As neat as dolphins are, they've got nothing on Homo sapiens sapiens.
[01:18:04.895 --> 01:18:15.909]  And the enemy has to blunt and dumb down that creativity and get us focused off into issues of no significance or brute, bestial, lower level, making that, you know, through the mammalian image,
[01:18:16.929 --> 01:18:17.270]  You got it.
[01:18:17.310 --> 01:18:18.830]  On the Michael Tassarin website,
[01:18:34.864 --> 01:18:41.006]  People will see an article there called Weapons of Mass Destruction Found, and it addresses this whole concept between the magic and the sorcery.
[01:18:41.126 --> 01:18:43.627]  I refer to what they're doing as sorcery, black sorcery.
[01:18:43.667 --> 01:18:58.292]  Basically, these people are possessed by a kind of archon, a demonic force that they serve, or they've... You can look at it the other way, that they have basically uploaded their own consciousness into that place, into that place of fear, envy, endless greed, endless darkness.
[01:18:58.332 --> 01:18:59.593]  It doesn't matter which way you look at it.
[01:18:59.633 --> 01:19:02.414]  Either something's possessed them, or they have uploaded their consciousness
[01:19:03.438 --> 01:19:09.522]  What they've done is they've murdered their own spirit psychologically, and then by doing that, you allow this dark sorcery to enter into you.
[01:19:10.082 --> 01:19:17.787]  Well, you can look at it either way, but the sum result is the infected, the person who is infected by that spiritual virus, cannot sit still.
[01:19:17.807 --> 01:19:20.008]  This is what the people of America and the world need to understand.
[01:19:20.348 --> 01:19:25.271]  That kind of infected person cannot sit still unless they go around and try to infect everybody else.
[01:19:25.631 --> 01:19:28.133]  The thing makes sense when you look at it from a psychological point of view.
[01:19:28.153 --> 01:19:28.453]  That's right.
[01:19:28.473 --> 01:19:31.835]  Faith without works is dead, and that goes for the dark side and the light side.
[01:19:32.375 --> 01:19:36.659]  I mean, people are going to manifest and build what their core is.
[01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:43.587]  And then notice the occultists at the higher levels want to make everybody low-level atheist and not believe any of that, so that blinds us.
[01:19:43.847 --> 01:19:48.332]  But at the top, the real top atheists in people are wild, satanic Luciferians.
[01:19:48.832 --> 01:19:49.953]  We're going to skip this break, too.
[01:19:49.993 --> 01:19:50.654]  BehindTheScenes.com.
[01:19:52.908 --> 01:20:02.057]  Michael, let's just keep going, because have you noticed and seen the Theophilic Societies and the Blavatskyites and the OTO people?
[01:20:02.377 --> 01:20:14.208]  When you get up to high-level folks, like Dr. Pionk, I keep talking about, he's in a Druid outfit, he says, I love Lucifer on his website, on the official UT website, he names his bison bull Lucifer.
[01:20:15.129 --> 01:20:26.491]  You know, when you really get around these guys, they are into the occult, but into their classes and everybody, they're making fun of anybody who's religious, anybody who believes there's other dimensions, anybody who believes there's more to the world.
[01:20:27.051 --> 01:20:40.893]  They go, oh, you're not of reason, and I see that as shuddering people from whatever humans are, and you know, whatever this hunger for religion, you know, shuddering us down here, so they can operate up here with, as you call it, you know, their sorcery, which is their mind control.
[01:20:41.934 --> 01:20:44.254]  That's right, and many of these other organizations
[01:20:44.813 --> 01:20:54.579]  You see, are like fraternal orders in which you have to pass through them in order to be matriculated to get into, you know, what I would say, like what we talked about in the first segment about the Atmos, the true story of masonry.
[01:20:54.599 --> 01:20:56.780]  They're not just going to hand that down to anybody.
[01:20:57.101 --> 01:21:04.185]  So they put, from the school level onwards, through all of these various occult and other organizations, you see, they're like steps on the ladder.
[01:21:04.245 --> 01:21:06.146]  I mean, even the masons use the symbol of the ladder.
[01:21:06.967 --> 01:21:08.888]  You have to die into what you knew.
[01:21:09.108 --> 01:21:10.429]  You have to die to the world that you knew.
[01:21:10.839 --> 01:21:26.660]  And I believe this is a kind of insanity, a form of unsane insanity, and therefore you have to sort of, they have a carrot and a stick approach in which you have to then matriculate, matriculate, matriculate until you are complicit and submissive enough so that they can then infect you with their infection.
[01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:28.202]  It's basically as simple as that.
[01:21:28.633 --> 01:21:36.259]  Until people strengthen themselves through knowledge, which is the only way to strengthen and have a spiritual connection to something, you know, they're not going to be able to warm up.
[01:21:36.580 --> 01:21:39.142]  Well, you talk about psychic vampirism.
[01:21:39.762 --> 01:21:42.084]  There is no doubt that's what this new world order is.
[01:21:43.105 --> 01:21:43.545]  Big time.
[01:21:43.585 --> 01:21:44.586]  You know, we're doing DVDs.
[01:21:44.606 --> 01:21:46.087]  That's another DVD project we're doing.
[01:21:46.568 --> 01:21:54.414]  Right now, I believe that things are moving so fast that, you know, and remember, as we said earlier, there's only so much of this knowledge that we study that people can handle.
[01:21:54.793 --> 01:21:59.414]  They're already balking and they're already, you know, covering their eyes and screaming to hide under the bed.
[01:21:59.794 --> 01:22:07.556]  Even with the sort of lower level stuff about the Illuminati and, you know, the death of the Constitution, they can't even handle that, let alone things like psychic vampirism and war on consciousness.
[01:22:07.956 --> 01:22:16.938]  So, you know, I tend to pace my stuff out there because I realize that sometimes, you know, and this of course does not include everyone, there are people who are totally ready for this, but the masses of the world are not ready for this.
[01:22:16.998 --> 01:22:20.219]  So you have to sort of go slow and pace what you're creating and what you're writing about.
[01:22:20.660 --> 01:22:25.663]  You know, what you're putting out there, you can tell them a little bit about it, because the human race is so unready for a lot of this.
[01:22:25.683 --> 01:22:28.905]  There is an awakening taking place, but it's also a very natal thing.
[01:22:28.925 --> 01:22:29.545]  Well, I know this.
[01:22:29.645 --> 01:22:31.246]  I go off what my gut tells me.
[01:22:31.266 --> 01:22:36.309]  You know, I analyze the real world, what I can prove, but my gut tells me the human race is very, very old.
[01:22:36.729 --> 01:22:44.194]  The human race has incredible potential and is really going to go places if we can only move past this whole new world order system.
[01:22:47.188 --> 01:22:50.909]  My main message in most of my work is to understand the nature of deconstruction.
[01:22:51.309 --> 01:22:57.611]  That moving forward is partly acquisitive and partly an active movement forward, but you also have to jettison.
[01:22:57.911 --> 01:23:01.552]  And anything that moves forward, anything that's going to progress, it also needs to shed skins.
[01:23:01.632 --> 01:23:08.613]  It also needs to jettison and deconstruct all the rubbish and all the miasma and all the webs, you see, of ignorance.
[01:23:09.454 --> 01:23:10.974]  Learning is a dual process.
[01:23:11.014 --> 01:23:15.375]  It requires you to clean, just like we have to wash our bodies when dust accumulates and dirt accumulates.
[01:23:15.782 --> 01:23:18.544]  We have to clean our cars, our homes, everything, the plates we eat off.
[01:23:19.005 --> 01:23:21.386]  And people sometimes have forgotten this in their search for the light.
[01:23:21.647 --> 01:23:32.015]  They also have to realize that there's a lot of parasites, a lot of sharks, a lot of mosquitoes, a lot of, you know, like we talked about earlier, a lot of darkness that comes around as you start moving towards the truth and towards the light.
[01:23:32.315 --> 01:23:34.097]  That's when the dirt is going to be shining up.
[01:23:34.137 --> 01:23:35.838]  That's when you're going to see the dirt for what it is.
[01:23:36.138 --> 01:23:38.300]  You can't say yuck and run away from it or hide.
[01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:43.344]  You've got to know how to take out the right kind of detergent to deal with the dirt, be it psychic or social or anything else.
[01:23:43.846 --> 01:23:53.472]  And in my work, the basic message to everyone is you're not going to have legal, social, political sovereignty or any solvency until you've got it mentally and spiritually.
[01:23:53.512 --> 01:23:55.293]  Stay there, stay there, stay there.
[01:23:56.734 --> 01:23:58.515]  Here we go.
[01:23:59.276 --> 01:24:08.882]  You know, I take myself as a microcosm of a journey of awakening.
[01:24:09.963 --> 01:24:13.065]  Some people misinterpret what I'm doing as fear.
[01:24:14.710 --> 01:24:19.762]  No, fear would put people in their box, in a catatonic state, in a field position, not moving forward.
[01:24:19.822 --> 01:24:20.944]  Why has Alex Jones?
[01:24:22.210 --> 01:24:33.039]  For all my foibles and problems, why have I been the most effective, and I think that's universally pretty much accepted even by my detractors on all fronts, as the most effective at waking people up?
[01:24:33.059 --> 01:24:41.606]  Well, it's because I reached out to the people of the United States and the world and taught them and showed them how much power they had and how much they could do to wake up others.
[01:24:41.707 --> 01:24:46.391]  And that's why, if you're the listeners and the visitors of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com,
[01:24:47.338 --> 01:24:48.739]  So you judge a tree by its fruits.
[01:24:48.859 --> 01:24:52.463]  We have really resisted the New World Order, had a lot of victories against them, woken up a lot of people.
[01:24:52.523 --> 01:25:12.782]  And it's because I have passion, and I am aggressive, and I am angry, and I shake people out of the mesmerized position they're in with the TV and the culture, to then just kind of like a cold bucket of water, ice water, wake them up and shake them out of that.
[01:25:13.542 --> 01:25:18.846]  And Michael Tesari and David Icke, many others have also been very, very successful at doing this.
[01:25:19.587 --> 01:25:25.291]  So, what are your ideas of how to fight this technocracy?
[01:25:25.331 --> 01:25:36.740]  I mean, I want people to see how dangerous it is and know what a great threat it is, so they will move out of the way of the threat and then over it and on top of it and, you know, to denature it.
[01:25:38.968 --> 01:25:49.453]  I mean, what are your ideas of how this revolution of human consciousness, how this is going to play out, and what are your ideas in the solution?
[01:25:50.534 --> 01:25:54.776]  Well, see, whatever you want to call it, God, nature has already given us the tools.
[01:25:54.796 --> 01:25:55.877]  It's called the human reason.
[01:25:56.397 --> 01:25:57.698]  It's called the human curiosity.
[01:25:58.038 --> 01:25:59.338]  This has built the greatest bridges.
[01:25:59.358 --> 01:26:00.919]  It has created the shuttle.
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:03.381]  It has built the greatest nations on earth.
[01:26:03.401 --> 01:26:04.141]  It's built pyramids.
[01:26:04.679 --> 01:26:18.784]  We already have the hardware within us installed, but what has happened is we've been conditioned to not use it, to doubt our own sensibilities, to doubt our own bodies, to doubt that we have control over our own lives and our own families and our own communities.
[01:26:19.284 --> 01:26:21.685]  And this has been the insipid drip-feeding you see of the lie.
[01:26:21.945 --> 01:26:24.706]  I'm going to back up and talk about what you just said there about being angry.
[01:26:25.466 --> 01:26:32.909]  First of all, I do not have a degree in psychology, but I have studied the subject thoroughly, and I can tell you that you, Alex, are neither mad nor paranoid.
[01:26:33.419 --> 01:26:39.600]  And that you are a person who's got the guts to stand up and be as mad as hell, who can channel her anger positively.
[01:26:40.020 --> 01:26:40.821]  And this is what is needed.
[01:26:41.341 --> 01:26:42.401]  Go back to the movie Network.
[01:26:42.621 --> 01:26:43.801]  You gotta be as mad as hell.
[01:26:43.981 --> 01:26:45.661]  You gotta fall in love with the word no.
[01:26:45.902 --> 01:26:47.102]  You gotta ask questions.
[01:26:47.322 --> 01:26:50.162]  And you gotta do it when anyone else comes to help you do it or not.
[01:26:50.642 --> 01:26:52.023]  And this is very vital.
[01:26:52.083 --> 01:26:55.263]  You know, as I said, Ulster men from my country fought in the War of Independence.
[01:26:56.024 --> 01:26:57.644]  This war, to me, is still going on.
[01:26:58.064 --> 01:27:00.805]  And people need to be armed up because something is shooting at us.
[01:27:01.125 --> 01:27:03.185]  Something is taking away that which is most precious.
[01:27:03.570 --> 01:27:04.891]  And therefore something has to be done.
[01:27:05.191 --> 01:27:13.675]  And you have to be as mad as hell, but you also have to channel that madness, and that healthy anger, and be armed up to fight this kind of tiger in the long grass.
[01:27:13.996 --> 01:27:15.977]  It is not something that's going to make itself known.
[01:27:16.317 --> 01:27:18.438]  You could easily shoot in the wrong direction, you see?
[01:27:18.798 --> 01:27:21.400]  So people need to be armed up with knowledge and education.
[01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:31.225]  And I will not stand in my life, you see, which is happening a lot, I see in the world, that these people who come into this subject, either they're bandwagon hoppers, or like we said, they're maybe debunkers or whatever,
[01:27:31.593 --> 01:27:39.157]  Or they may just be a bunch of intellectuals who try to come there, you know, with the same rules that they knew in the college, in the university, in the mainstream, jumping through the hoops.
[01:27:39.437 --> 01:27:41.658]  And then they come into this world and go, where's your qualifications?
[01:27:42.038 --> 01:27:45.500]  You know, what kind of books and DVDs have you written or done?
[01:27:45.820 --> 01:27:49.342]  You know, and they want to territorialize this knowledge and they want to make you jump through the hoops.
[01:27:50.042 --> 01:27:54.243]  See, I've always told, just like you do, the average person, take action, be a leader.
[01:27:54.603 --> 01:27:56.423]  You know, it can do incredible things.
[01:27:56.483 --> 01:27:59.604]  And the enemy hates that, that I tell people that they're empowered individually.
[01:27:59.884 --> 01:28:03.905]  They try to misquote me and misinterpret and claim that I'm saying that people don't have power.
[01:28:03.965 --> 01:28:09.186]  No, I'm saying you do have power, you do affect change, you can change the world around you.
[01:28:10.346 --> 01:28:15.207]  Well, you see, one of the earliest mottos, one of the earliest mottos of the ancient Irish,
[01:28:15.817 --> 01:28:21.639]  It's very simple, and it's said in Gaelic, but in English, it is deeds to match words.
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:30.122]  And this is the fact, that here we are in a situation of colossal attack on the human race.
[01:28:30.382 --> 01:28:37.465]  We are literally dealing with the death of America, if we're not careful, you know, at least the death of the America that was known and built by the forefathers.
[01:28:37.825 --> 01:28:43.367]  And people are sitting there passively and twittering and howling and screeching about meaningless crap.
[01:28:43.772 --> 01:28:46.136]  They gotta get off of their damn ass, is what I say.
[01:28:46.196 --> 01:28:48.299]  You know, people do exactly what you're doing.
[01:28:48.339 --> 01:28:50.682]  So, I'm hoping that people will model themselves on you.
[01:28:50.983 --> 01:28:52.405]  You know, what happens when people watch...
[01:28:52.921 --> 01:28:55.843]  You know, what was the reality back in the 1950s?
[01:28:55.863 --> 01:29:04.147]  You know, people like me in Britain, Alex, grew up watching the Humphrey Bogart, you know, movies, the Jimmy Cagney movies, when people in America looked you right in the eye and told you where to get off.
[01:29:04.447 --> 01:29:05.228]  What the hell happened?
[01:29:05.248 --> 01:29:08.129]  How did everything become so politically correct and so asinine?
[01:29:08.169 --> 01:29:13.532]  Well, notice the mainstream media always tells us, be passive, don't be aggressive, don't stand up for yourself.
[01:29:13.812 --> 01:29:16.534]  But meanwhile, the government is aggressive and pushy towards us.
[01:29:16.914 --> 01:29:18.415]  They're letting us know they're the boss.
[01:29:20.751 --> 01:29:22.473]  Well, Michael Tasarian is our guest.
[01:29:22.493 --> 01:29:24.936]  This is so important for the InfoWars streams.
[01:29:24.996 --> 01:29:28.720]  I'm going to skip this again and come back for everybody else in just three minutes.
[01:29:29.140 --> 01:29:34.686]  This is the one, the only GCN Radio Network and MichaelTasarian.com is the website.
[01:29:34.706 --> 01:29:37.109]  I'll be a routine guest here on the show.
[01:29:37.169 --> 01:29:37.549]  Stay with us.
[01:29:37.569 --> 01:29:38.170]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:41.437 --> 01:29:50.644]  Okay, Michael, when we come back, I want to plug some of your books and videos for the full audience, but in the last 30 minutes when we come back, I've got to plug a few sponsors as well.
[01:29:51.304 --> 01:29:53.085]  What are some of the final things you want to discuss?
[01:29:54.386 --> 01:29:58.069]  Well, let's just talk about... I want to give people a heads up on the DVD that's coming out.
[01:29:58.089 --> 01:29:58.970]  It's actually a series.
[01:29:59.010 --> 01:30:00.751]  We're making like two or three in the series.
[01:30:00.831 --> 01:30:03.333]  It's going to be on technology and basically focusing on the future
[01:30:03.962 --> 01:30:06.904]  Because, you know, there's one thing to critique what's been going on in the past.
[01:30:06.964 --> 01:30:15.070]  It's like my focus is now on where we're heading, and it's very much that this technology used wrongly is going to be one of the major clubs in the hand of the global elite.
[01:30:15.250 --> 01:30:17.232]  Well, what's happening is, incrementally,
[01:30:18.621 --> 01:30:29.606]  Incrementally, they are intensifying the poison in the shots, in the water, in the food, the frequency pollution, which they admit is really hurting people, the cell phones and the wireless and all of it.
[01:30:30.026 --> 01:30:35.808]  And I do see them gradually accelerating now the gradual implementation of all of this.
[01:30:35.948 --> 01:30:39.049]  And I do see it all coming to a head in 2012 and beyond.
[01:30:39.090 --> 01:30:41.991]  I see that as the real kickoff of what they believe to be the final
[01:30:43.011 --> 01:30:43.592]  All the paganism.
[01:31:09.961 --> 01:31:10.602]  It's amazing, well...
[01:31:22.981 --> 01:31:27.124]  When we come back, we'll get into the technocracy, where you see things going.
[01:31:27.164 --> 01:31:37.951]  I mean, break down specifically the type of upheavals you think we're going to witness, how this whole economic banking takeover feeds into it as well, Michael.
[01:31:38.551 --> 01:31:40.513]  And there is so much on your site.
[01:31:40.993 --> 01:31:43.474]  How many documentaries or videos have you done?
[01:31:44.515 --> 01:31:49.078]  Well, I've done one series of 22 DVDs.
[01:31:49.118 --> 01:31:50.119]  There's 6 DVDs, 22 discs in all.
[01:31:50.139 --> 01:31:51.420]  It's called The Origins and Oracles.
[01:31:52.893 --> 01:31:53.434]  Yeah, sure.
[01:31:53.494 --> 01:31:53.874]  Always.
[01:31:53.974 --> 01:31:54.314]  Absolutely.
[01:31:54.374 --> 01:31:57.117]  There's been a barrage of it since, in fact, last year.
[01:31:57.877 --> 01:32:00.399]  So we have to be very cautious, you know.
[01:32:16.943 --> 01:32:19.145]  Yeah, we've had a lot of people have their places broken into.
[01:32:19.185 --> 01:32:21.067]  We've had stuff done to our vehicles over here.
[01:32:21.087 --> 01:32:25.591]  A lot of things I don't get into on air, but man, the attacks are intensifying.
[01:32:26.494 --> 01:32:26.774]  Sure.
[01:32:26.834 --> 01:32:28.236]  These people can prevent you traveling.
[01:32:28.276 --> 01:32:29.697]  They can fuck with you in many ways.
[01:32:29.717 --> 01:32:30.397]  All right.
[01:32:30.638 --> 01:32:32.840]  Listen, it's a good thing we're not on the AM and FM dial right now.
[01:32:33.140 --> 01:32:33.840]  This is the U.S.
[01:32:34.341 --> 01:32:39.325]  This is actually on a lot of AM and FM stations, all these little internet, which are very important shows, but, you know, they can get away with that.
[01:32:39.365 --> 01:32:43.829]  We can't do that, Michael, so be careful when we come back, even with the hells and damns.
[01:32:43.869 --> 01:32:44.830]  I'm not trying to censor you.
[01:32:45.190 --> 01:32:47.252]  I just think it gives people an excuse not to listen to what you have to say.
[01:32:47.492 --> 01:32:48.533]  Okay, here we go, my friend.
[01:32:48.613 --> 01:32:48.893]  Here we go.
[01:33:02.653 --> 01:33:10.696]  I'm going to take five phone calls for Michael Tesarian coming up in about 15 minutes.
[01:33:10.716 --> 01:33:11.016]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:33:11.036 --> 01:33:12.736]  Specific questions for the guests.
[01:33:12.816 --> 01:33:16.298]  Pretty wide ranging, so any topic goes.
[01:33:16.318 --> 01:33:17.278]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:33:17.898 --> 01:33:22.640]  Before we go back to Michael, I wanted to tell you about a couple of our sponsors.
[01:33:23.732 --> 01:33:26.233]  One of them is Food Shortage USA.
[01:33:26.813 --> 01:33:32.735]  And no, this is not eFoodDirect.com, the great folks that are our biggest sponsor for storable food, so you're not dependent on the system.
[01:33:32.755 --> 01:33:36.577]  That's one of the biggest solutions is be self-sufficient, get more and more off their grid.
[01:33:36.937 --> 01:33:40.558]  Food Shortage USA teaches you how to inexpensively store food yourself.
[01:33:40.938 --> 01:33:43.179]  FoodShortage.com is the website.
[01:33:43.199 --> 01:33:44.119]  FoodShortage.com.
[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:53.286]  And phase one of the insider's plan for one world government has been identified with the recent bailout.
[01:33:53.326 --> 01:33:59.471]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new world bank to act as a savior.
[01:33:59.731 --> 01:34:02.213]  And that's globally setting all the currencies at one price.
[01:34:02.253 --> 01:34:03.093]  That is a global currency.
[01:34:03.434 --> 01:34:04.515]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[01:34:04.555 --> 01:34:07.637]  The insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[01:34:07.717 --> 01:34:10.940]  One is the world currency, which are currently being prepared to accept any other as food.
[01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:13.382]  We're witnessing the engineered financial crisis, folks.
[01:34:13.422 --> 01:34:14.543]  Don't wait until it's too late.
[01:34:14.783 --> 01:34:21.150]  Go to FoodShortageUSA.com to learn how to make your own storable foods for you and your family to prepare for the road ahead.
[01:34:21.170 --> 01:34:26.835]  The website reveals a step-by-step way for the average person to get prepared for what's ahead.
[01:34:26.875 --> 01:34:28.056]  FoodShortageUSA.com or 877-327-0365.
[01:34:28.076 --> 01:34:28.216]  877-327-0365.
[01:34:28.257 --> 01:34:28.877]  Great information.
[01:34:28.897 --> 01:34:29.077]  And folks,
[01:34:36.444 --> 01:34:38.326]  The thing here is, it's not that we're in fear.
[01:34:38.666 --> 01:34:40.168]  We know the food prices are going up.
[01:34:40.208 --> 01:34:42.910]  We know there's food shortages worldwide, from Iceland to Africa.
[01:34:42.930 --> 01:34:43.610]  I mean, it's all over.
[01:34:44.031 --> 01:34:46.112]  We know they're artificially doing this.
[01:34:46.133 --> 01:34:47.313]  They're talking about depression.
[01:34:47.434 --> 01:34:48.935]  It's good to be self-sufficient.
[01:34:48.955 --> 01:34:49.996]  We're empowered.
[01:34:51.777 --> 01:34:52.518]  We see a threat.
[01:34:52.558 --> 01:34:53.379]  We prepare for it.
[01:34:54.187 --> 01:34:54.967]  Okay, it's that simple.
[01:34:55.347 --> 01:35:03.829]  Also, another great sponsor is NewVitality.com, an old, established, high-quality vitamin and mineral company that Codex Alimentarius is trying to block.
[01:35:03.849 --> 01:35:05.889]  They don't have any magic cures or miracle stuff.
[01:35:06.790 --> 01:35:12.871]  What they have is just high-quality minerals and vitamins and things that are known to have good health effects, like aloes, colon, and body cleanse.
[01:35:13.491 --> 01:35:14.611]  It's 30 different herbs.
[01:35:15.111 --> 01:35:19.952]  It's super-concentrated aloe vera, well-known to detoxify and flush out your guts, 800-569-4056.
[01:35:20.172 --> 01:35:21.052]  They have super-beta-prostate.
[01:35:24.313 --> 01:35:25.714]  Just very well documented.
[01:35:26.834 --> 01:35:33.396]  The salt palm meadow and other things that are in it, a whole bunch of herbs that are known to shrink the prostate, make it a lot healthier.
[01:35:33.456 --> 01:35:35.116]  Every male over 45 should be taking this.
[01:35:35.697 --> 01:35:39.038]  Just one ingredient, salt palm meadow, is recommended by a lot of medical doctors.
[01:35:39.438 --> 01:35:40.958]  So the plants we have, 1-800-569-4056, 1-800-569-4056, or newvitality.com.
[01:35:40.978 --> 01:35:43.099]  If you forget that banner, there's a link up on infowars.com.
[01:35:49.841 --> 01:35:52.842]  Okay, going back to Michael Tasarian, michaeltasarian.com.
[01:35:53.342 --> 01:36:01.483]  Michael, I want to go to some calls here in about 10 minutes or so, but continue with the technological control grid, and you talk about them clamping down the next three years or so.
[01:36:01.883 --> 01:36:05.604]  Really, I mean, people think we've already seen an intensification of operations by the globalists.
[01:36:05.984 --> 01:36:08.345]  You're talking about really intensifying things.
[01:36:08.745 --> 01:36:09.685]  Break that down for us.
[01:36:10.745 --> 01:36:14.086]  Well, these are people who've always thought of man as some sort of golem.
[01:36:14.246 --> 01:36:15.326]  You know the story of the golem?
[01:36:16.465 --> 01:36:33.429]  And even coming out of the New Age movement, all this stuff about the Greys, you know, I believe that that's been infiltrated, and a lot of that is disinformation, in order to, you know, prepare us to be not only afraid, of course, of some sort of off-world invasion, that, you know, that is science fiction, but it works well to prepare people for what's coming.
[01:36:33.929 --> 01:36:41.931]  But basically, when you start reading the certain schools of Bertrand Russell and these kinds of people, and these other maniacs that I deal with in, you know, my work,
[01:36:43.183 --> 01:36:56.766]  Throughout my books and DVDs, these individuals literally do think of themselves as some sort of robotic, mechanical beings, and nothing could be... In their greatest pipe dreams, you see, is to make a completely controllable human being.
[01:36:57.066 --> 01:37:07.108]  I actually believe that for ritual purposes, certain segments of these Illumined Ones, so-called, wanted to completely devastate and wipe out the human race a long time ago.
[01:37:07.468 --> 01:37:10.389]  And that another quadrant, another section or cadre,
[01:37:11.064 --> 01:37:23.828]  Sort of, you know, frowned upon that in the past and didn't want that, and came up with the idea that, look, to make the perfect robot, all we gotta do is dumb down the people of the world to the level of the robot, to the level of the cyborg, and the job is done.
[01:37:24.428 --> 01:37:25.809]  And that's basically where we're at.
[01:37:25.889 --> 01:37:27.870]  That's where we've been up until now.
[01:37:28.390 --> 01:37:30.310]  Now, they have restored the technology.
[01:37:30.330 --> 01:37:35.272]  Because remember, these people armed themselves to the teeth with not only knowledge, but occult knowledge.
[01:37:35.822 --> 01:37:39.145]  And so, I am not a person who's a Luddite.
[01:37:39.425 --> 01:37:40.646]  I am all for technology.
[01:37:40.946 --> 01:37:48.872]  But I do not want technology in the hands of occultists who are working from, you know, occult knowledge and then arming themselves with this technology.
[01:37:48.892 --> 01:37:49.613]  This is the problem.
[01:37:49.913 --> 01:37:53.676]  And this is also a message to those who are working in these technological sort of enclaves.
[01:37:53.896 --> 01:38:03.063]  They gotta be aware of this and research this to find out about the occult ideologies that are behind these technical orgs and behind some of these, you know, people's champions.
[01:38:03.877 --> 01:38:10.963]  Within the Genome Project and with some of these materialist philosophers and scientists who are just itching to create the global village.
[01:38:11.283 --> 01:38:16.148]  And that, through the electronics, through the technologies, through the cybernetics, you see.
[01:38:16.448 --> 01:38:17.769]  And this is actually an old story.
[01:38:17.789 --> 01:38:22.033]  People are familiar with the work I did in my Atlantis book, know that this is a very old story.
[01:38:22.413 --> 01:38:27.237]  That these cybernetics and cryogenics and the genetic manipulation is not something new.
[01:38:27.658 --> 01:38:31.381]  It's just that they've had to build back the technology at a record pace now.
[01:38:31.963 --> 01:38:34.024]  You know, in the chronology of time.
[01:38:34.404 --> 01:38:35.685]  And they're succeeding to do this.
[01:38:36.145 --> 01:38:39.247]  And that is why I believe they have postponed certain other events.
[01:38:39.687 --> 01:38:42.408]  Because they wanted the tunnel vision on this particular thing.
[01:38:42.688 --> 01:38:45.930]  It's backed up by the work of Jim Keith and these people that I've been mentioning a lot here.
[01:38:46.510 --> 01:38:48.911]  And we've got to realize, you see, that this is coming down.
[01:38:48.971 --> 01:38:51.833]  It's not just with arming the police with superweapons.
[01:38:52.193 --> 01:38:55.815]  It's not just putting the, you know, HAARP technology and microwave technology.
[01:38:56.711 --> 01:39:05.055]  ...installing that on the satellites so that they have a complete police state, global village situation in which no nation or no person can operate independently, you see.
[01:39:05.395 --> 01:39:10.077]  And then they troubleshoot this, they check it out in the terrestrial wars that are going on on the planet.
[01:39:10.798 --> 01:39:14.139]  These block operations that have been exposed... Yeah, they call them laboratories.
[01:39:14.179 --> 01:39:15.260]  They call it a laboratory.
[01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:16.860]  They call a war a laboratory.
[01:39:17.781 --> 01:39:18.081]  That's it.
[01:39:18.501 --> 01:39:22.103]  So they want this particular being, you know, magnetized,
[01:39:22.660 --> 01:39:29.223]  Vaccinated, you know, injected, and completely, you know, digitized so that they can then control every aspect of what you're doing.
[01:39:29.263 --> 01:39:32.425]  Here's one microcosm example.
[01:39:32.805 --> 01:39:40.628]  The GMO milk, the GMO food, the plastics, and there's hundreds of types of plastics they pick for worldwide distribution over 90% of the plastic cups.
[01:39:41.089 --> 01:39:47.071]  The one type of plastic that sheds the estrogen-mimicking hormones, it's a documented fact.
[01:39:47.432 --> 01:39:49.333]  They chose it 40 years ago for that reason.
[01:39:49.373 --> 01:39:49.873]  That's come out.
[01:39:50.373 --> 01:40:02.355]  And then three-year-old girls, four-year-old girls, by the tens of thousands, by the millions at seven, eight, nine, are going into puberty early, then they get breast cancer early, you know, they get sick early, and then they know all that.
[01:40:02.755 --> 01:40:07.036]  And when they go to the doctor, they don't say, quit drinking GMO milk, they don't say, quit drinking out of plastic.
[01:40:07.356 --> 01:40:19.038]  They say, oh, we're going to give you hardcore, complex hormonal injections that then suppress that, but then also give you Cushing's disease and fry all your glands.
[01:40:20.418 --> 01:40:21.699]  So again, they engineer that.
[01:40:21.739 --> 01:40:23.380]  The local doctor is compartmentalized.
[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:24.201]  He doesn't know.
[01:40:24.501 --> 01:40:26.322]  And they give the little girl something that's far worse.
[01:40:26.582 --> 01:40:33.727]  Meanwhile, our boys are on so much estrogen that now they've got 10, 12, 14, 15-year-old boys whose testicles haven't dropped.
[01:40:33.787 --> 01:40:35.948]  And I hate to get technical, but they're like ovaries.
[01:40:35.968 --> 01:40:36.969]  They're still inside the body.
[01:40:37.409 --> 01:40:42.170]  Absolutely, I couldn't agree more, and it goes to this whole idea of the heart of tyranny, the origin of tyranny, and that the human race
[01:41:05.228 --> 01:41:05.388]  Yeah.
[01:41:19.716 --> 01:41:20.096]  Quiet.
[01:41:20.136 --> 01:41:23.580]  They know that there is an awakening taking place, so these guys just don't let that happen.
[01:41:23.980 --> 01:41:40.396]  They have to also, you know, arm themselves to react against the awakening that this... Well, I had one of them on earlier, where they're going to put all these satellite trackers in all the cars to Texas, and from a government study, and he was going, it's okay, it's not coming for a long time, it may not even happen, this is good for you.
[01:41:40.416 --> 01:41:42.698]  I mean, and it's always the same script.
[01:41:44.031 --> 01:41:47.033]  It's always the same script, and I tie it into The Awakening.
[01:41:47.053 --> 01:42:00.642]  You know, I said this in one of my talks entitled Origins of Evil, and in the first ten minutes of that talk I said that, look, as the human child starts to awaken and tries to gain back his spirit, that is exactly at the point where the monster, the vampire comes in.
[01:42:00.922 --> 01:42:06.686]  They're waiting there to infuse you with more, you know, toxicity so that you again fall into your
[01:42:06.886 --> 01:42:07.987]  But see, that's it.
[01:42:08.007 --> 01:42:11.029]  They want you to fall into the sleep, and that's why you're affected, why I'm affected.
[01:42:11.049 --> 01:42:13.331]  We're shaking them, going, no, wake up!
[01:42:13.391 --> 01:42:14.312]  Don't even believe me!
[01:42:14.572 --> 01:42:21.998]  You're being manipulated by Madison Avenue, by the culture, by the propaganda, and if you can't even admit that when it's admitted, there's much more advanced things.
[01:42:22.299 --> 01:42:26.322]  We're shocking them, saying, you need to realize what's going on.
[01:42:26.722 --> 01:42:29.945]  There needs to be that urgency for people to get out
[01:42:30.345 --> 01:42:33.049]  You know, like, I knew cell phones were frying my brain, but I kept using them.
[01:42:33.109 --> 01:42:35.832]  I finally got to where I check my messages about once a day on it.
[01:42:36.112 --> 01:42:37.214]  I keep it far away from me.
[01:42:37.434 --> 01:42:38.976]  My wife isn't using hers anymore.
[01:42:39.196 --> 01:42:40.057]  We're living without it.
[01:42:40.358 --> 01:42:40.918]  It tracks us.
[01:42:40.999 --> 01:42:41.519]  It hurts us.
[01:42:41.780 --> 01:42:43.261]  You know, I could break my habit.
[01:42:43.622 --> 01:42:46.485]  We can all do this, and it takes the urgency, Michael.
[01:42:47.478 --> 01:43:01.646]  Yeah, but when you have a media that turns around and shows you Bill Gates' wife is, you know, injecting her dog with a microchip and then suddenly it's not the dog anymore, it's the children, just like you showed on Road to Tyranny, you have that stupid, gormless LA family who goes, this is just wonderful, I can't wait!
[01:43:02.130 --> 01:43:06.472]  You know, it's going to save abduction, it's going to save kidnapping, it's going to save your dog.
[01:43:06.752 --> 01:43:10.674]  You know, the human race is dumb enough to be turning around and going, yeah, I want one too, where can I get it?
[01:43:10.874 --> 01:43:21.580]  By the way, it turns out that was all fake, and the family worked for Applied Digital Solution, an IBM front directorate, and then magically, magically members of the family started dying.
[01:43:22.864 --> 01:43:23.405]  How about that?
[01:43:23.505 --> 01:43:24.746]  Well, this is the casualty list.
[01:43:24.786 --> 01:43:29.330]  They never publicized that about all the, like they said, with the estrogen that they're pumping into the girls.
[01:43:29.751 --> 01:43:35.917]  And then these court cases that are backed up because there's been so much, you know, reactions in these children and these young people.
[01:43:35.957 --> 01:43:38.299]  I'm very concerned about this whole medicated child bit.
[01:43:38.839 --> 01:43:40.441]  I do a lot of work on that and a lot of research on that.
[01:43:40.461 --> 01:43:43.325]  But see, that's what the HPV is, a live cancer virus.
[01:43:43.645 --> 01:43:47.610]  It's killing a bunch of people, maiming tens of thousands, and they knew it would do that.
[01:43:47.670 --> 01:43:57.843]  They rolled it out as a test of how to cover it up, how to suppress it, how to have these soft kill weapons being openly used out in the public and testing how to compartmentalize it and cover it up.
[01:43:58.976 --> 01:44:00.897]  And they tried on different populations of the world.
[01:44:01.137 --> 01:44:05.980]  Remember, one type of virus is not going to work well on different kinds of nations, different kinds of people.
[01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:16.986]  I can tell you, you know, and I know you know this, that from the AIDS virus down, from the bird flus, and from all of this other stuff, these are rehearsals for the worldwide plague.
[01:44:17.066 --> 01:44:20.188]  They're testing how soft kills move.
[01:44:20.208 --> 01:44:21.589]  Go ahead, absolutely right.
[01:44:22.629 --> 01:44:24.950]  Yeah, they're ready to unleash a global plague.
[01:44:24.990 --> 01:44:27.792]  You know, the science fiction writers have already written about it and tried to warn people.
[01:44:28.317 --> 01:44:29.377]  And this is the perfect way.
[01:44:29.417 --> 01:44:29.958]  Through food.
[01:44:30.058 --> 01:44:30.638]  It's through food.
[01:44:30.678 --> 01:44:33.979]  There's an old statement that says that people are three meals away from revolution.
[01:44:34.399 --> 01:44:36.660]  This was brought out in movies like Three Days of the Condor.
[01:44:37.220 --> 01:44:38.900]  Some people have used it in the context of oil.
[01:44:39.201 --> 01:44:49.624]  But oil is a hell of a lot less important than the food, you know, sort of Damocles that these people are going to use because they're sequestering the organic seeds now just like in some sort of hideous, you know,
[01:44:50.428 --> 01:44:51.750]  Uh, Noah's Ark experiment.
[01:44:52.290 --> 01:44:53.351]  We've got the facts on this.
[01:44:53.371 --> 01:44:54.292]  We've got the proof on this.
[01:44:54.352 --> 01:44:55.474]  They're working overtime on it.
[01:44:55.494 --> 01:44:57.356]  Well, James Bond was Ian Fleming.
[01:44:57.736 --> 01:44:59.638]  OSS and then MI6.
[01:44:59.958 --> 01:45:01.300]  And they love to throw it in your face.
[01:45:01.340 --> 01:45:06.866]  And every one of those movies, later, some manifestation of reality would then be shown.
[01:45:07.346 --> 01:45:11.831]  And remember Moonraker, where the global elitists want to kill everybody and then repopulate the Earth.
[01:45:12.762 --> 01:45:18.809]  That's right, all the way from the first one, Her Majesty's Secret Service, all the way up to the Moonraker.
[01:45:18.849 --> 01:45:20.711]  You're right, they're whistleblowing this through the films.
[01:45:20.731 --> 01:45:21.492]  They want to tell.
[01:45:21.772 --> 01:45:23.454]  Because remember, this is a ritual situation.
[01:45:23.474 --> 01:45:27.619]  You need to tell the sacrificial goat what on earth is happening here.
[01:45:27.639 --> 01:45:28.800]  That's the lesser magic.
[01:45:29.941 --> 01:45:31.903]  Yeah, that's the lesser magic.
[01:45:31.923 --> 01:45:33.065]  They have to do that first, yeah.
[01:45:34.211 --> 01:45:36.554]  I totally agree with it, and that's what basically our job is.
[01:45:36.614 --> 01:45:44.603]  Our job is not to territorialize knowledge, not to jump through hoops, but to try and collate a lot of this information, present it for people, you know, in an unbiased way.
[01:45:44.724 --> 01:45:47.086]  And the enemy are in their own prison.
[01:45:47.387 --> 01:45:48.668]  They are habitualized.
[01:45:48.988 --> 01:45:50.570]  They are very obsessive-compulsive.
[01:45:50.831 --> 01:45:52.973]  They do everything the same over and over again.
[01:45:53.233 --> 01:45:54.515]  I think that's their weakness, Michael.
[01:45:55.598 --> 01:45:55.978]  Well, right.
[01:45:56.018 --> 01:46:00.500]  Remember earlier on you said that there's something wrong with them, there's something sort of inhuman about them?
[01:46:00.641 --> 01:46:09.285]  This, I believe, ties into an experimentation that happened in ancient times, in which certain beings were created, these are the world rulers today, and they don't even have
[01:46:09.781 --> 01:46:11.723]  What we would refer to as spirit or soul.
[01:46:11.743 --> 01:46:23.094]  So we've got to understand that we're talking about people here who are, you know, connected to sorcery and to dynastic concerns that have sworn themselves to this kind of control for years.
[01:46:23.174 --> 01:46:25.476]  They look at us like some people look at the pets.
[01:46:25.777 --> 01:46:29.700]  Like the laboratory, you know, doctor looks at the rats in the maze.
[01:46:29.740 --> 01:46:31.342]  That is exactly how the human race
[01:46:31.892 --> 01:46:35.894]  is to them, and it's something that needs to be controlled, and there's not, in their mind, any question about it.
[01:46:35.974 --> 01:46:59.168]  That's the way it has to go, because they look at us as untidy, unruly, you know, they look at us as just like cannon fodder, they always have done, and people need to understand that the movement of imperialism, the movement of tyranny, involves this invasion of our particular biological sovereignty, and our mental and spiritual sovereignty, just as much as it does working on a legal, political sphere of action.
[01:46:59.208 --> 01:47:00.429]  People tend to focus on that,
[01:47:01.344 --> 01:47:09.592]  You know, what's happening now is I hope that people can start to see the spiritual components of this and realize that there is an occult war taking place and it's on everything that is good.
[01:47:09.973 --> 01:47:16.559]  Well, the bottom line is, folks, you can believe us or not, but war is being waged against you by the technocratic elite.
[01:47:16.940 --> 01:47:18.861]  Whether it's real or not, they're all in the occult.
[01:47:18.921 --> 01:47:19.782]  They believe into it.
[01:47:19.802 --> 01:47:21.444]  You know, they believe what they're saying.
[01:47:21.484 --> 01:47:22.605]  What Michael's telling you is true.
[01:47:22.625 --> 01:47:24.447]  I mean, I don't know how true it would be.
[01:47:24.867 --> 01:47:26.367]  It is in facts, but they believe it.
[01:47:26.627 --> 01:47:31.589]  They believe they're another species, and they believe your baby is a piece of crap that needs to be killed.
[01:47:32.109 --> 01:47:33.529]  And they're coming for us.
[01:47:33.549 --> 01:47:34.489]  They're already attacking us.
[01:47:34.509 --> 01:47:35.589]  They brainwashed the cops.
[01:47:35.910 --> 01:47:37.190]  The military, they brainwashed.
[01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:38.150]  A lot of them are waking up.
[01:47:38.730 --> 01:47:39.870]  We didn't make it this way.
[01:47:40.271 --> 01:47:41.911]  Everything we've told you has come true so far.
[01:47:41.951 --> 01:47:46.152]  We're telling you it's going to get a lot more crazy, and you better realize this is life and death.
[01:47:46.412 --> 01:47:47.332]  Let's take some calls.
[01:47:47.552 --> 01:47:48.773]  Mick in Pennsylvania.
[01:47:49.053 --> 01:47:50.433]  You're on the air with Michael Tesarian.
[01:47:51.161 --> 01:47:51.762]  Thank you very much.
[01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:15.784]  Perhaps through the use of their own fairness doctrine, because we don't have much... Yeah, but they're going to selectively enforce that and use that to shut me down.
[01:48:15.824 --> 01:48:17.645]  That was always selectively used.
[01:48:17.665 --> 01:48:23.088]  We need to intensify the web, not let them take it over, not take it for granted while we still have it right now.
[01:48:24.289 --> 01:48:25.970]  Just real quick, in all his research,
[01:48:46.531 --> 01:48:54.155]  The Israeli identity message of the European race is actually being the supposedly lost tribes of Israel.
[01:48:54.515 --> 01:48:56.956]  Yes, that goes back to what I said earlier.
[01:48:57.497 --> 01:49:00.538]  Let me get Michael to comment on that.
[01:49:01.339 --> 01:49:14.545]  We told you the Queen of England is coronated on the Stone of Jacob, where supposedly Abraham was going to sacrifice him, and so yes, they believe that... This goes back to the Merovingian line.
[01:49:14.585 --> 01:49:15.326]  Do you want to explain this?
[01:49:16.553 --> 01:49:17.494]  Well, you're totally right.
[01:49:17.554 --> 01:49:26.044]  I was just going to say that, that we are in the hands of people who are dynastically linked to these Merovingians, who themselves, their ancestry goes all the way back into Egypt.
[01:49:26.565 --> 01:49:36.496]  And Mick, you know, if you pick up my book on the Irish origins of civilization, you'll have an enlightening experience, because you see, when people like yourself ask questions like this, it's very important to identify the terms.
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.821]  There's the real tribes and then there's the counterfeit.
[01:50:03.803 --> 01:50:04.223]  You bet.
[01:50:04.384 --> 01:50:04.564]  Yeah.
[01:50:04.724 --> 01:50:06.005]  And we've been handed the counterfeit.
[01:50:06.045 --> 01:50:12.913]  The time has come now to look behind the passion play and find out who is really operating behind these sort of, you know, as you say, the lost tribes.
[01:50:12.933 --> 01:50:17.197]  You know, it's a fascinating story of who the real Jews are, who the real Judaics are.
[01:50:17.558 --> 01:50:21.582]  We're using those terms as has been handed down to us from the establishment.
[01:50:21.622 --> 01:50:23.103]  They're not even the correct terms.
[01:50:23.203 --> 01:50:25.466]  So often when we're banding terms around like this,
[01:50:25.922 --> 01:50:28.543]  We're not even using them as their true, occult definition.
[01:50:28.583 --> 01:50:29.563]  This is the biggest problem.
[01:50:29.904 --> 01:50:36.606]  What does a Jew, the word mean to a Freemason, is a totally different meaning of that word than it is to, say, the layman on the street, you see.
[01:50:36.626 --> 01:50:43.689]  So the definition of terms is a research, is a time to study, to find out, you know, first of all, we're not even using the right definition.
[01:50:43.709 --> 01:50:46.370]  All right, Michael Desarian, final segment coming up.
[01:50:46.710 --> 01:50:48.411]  More of your phone calls straight ahead.
[01:50:48.491 --> 01:50:49.771]  Stay with us.
[01:50:50.552 --> 01:50:51.312]  We're going to skip this break.
[01:50:51.912 --> 01:50:52.552]  More than seven.
[01:50:52.572 --> 01:50:54.353]  Okay, I'm going to go back to calls right now.
[01:50:54.433 --> 01:50:56.413]  Let's talk to Michael in Texas.
[01:50:56.773 --> 01:50:57.894]  You're on the air, Michael.
[01:50:57.934 --> 01:50:58.374]  Go ahead.
[01:50:58.394 --> 01:50:58.994]  Thank you.
[01:51:00.094 --> 01:51:00.574]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:51:01.895 --> 01:51:03.095]  Alex?
[01:51:03.375 --> 01:51:03.775]  Yes, sir.
[01:51:03.915 --> 01:51:05.196]  Thank you so much for taking my call.
[01:51:06.276 --> 01:51:07.997]  Michael, I sure appreciate the work you do, too.
[01:51:11.398 --> 01:51:18.680]  Since the beginning of these thought forms of this oligarchy, as you said earlier, around 1500 B.C., the civilizations that have followed
[01:51:20.256 --> 01:51:33.426]  The reason why they've been able to continue this is because we've never been able to rise above their low-level vibration that they so cleverly sustained through their rituals that you were speaking about a while ago.
[01:51:33.446 --> 01:51:38.330]  My question is, how do we go about addressing that and those rituals?
[01:51:38.370 --> 01:51:43.694]  Is it something that we can do through our own meditations?
[01:51:46.030 --> 01:51:54.734]  Like, you know, for instance, covering the world with golden light, so as to... Well, see, I don't get into all the New Age stuff, and I appreciate your call.
[01:51:54.754 --> 01:51:56.315]  I'm going to let Michael comment on that.
[01:51:56.335 --> 01:51:57.615]  This is action.
[01:51:57.655 --> 01:51:58.416]  This is action.
[01:51:58.456 --> 01:51:59.376]  This is in the streets.
[01:51:59.616 --> 01:52:01.597]  I mean, let's say you're spiritually awake and alive.
[01:52:01.877 --> 01:52:03.558]  It is going to physically manifest.
[01:52:03.598 --> 01:52:06.900]  Look at India, where they're all filling it with golden light, and it's a hellhole.
[01:52:07.280 --> 01:52:09.401]  Now, I don't know if Michael agrees with that, but Michael, you want to comment?
[01:52:10.478 --> 01:52:16.302]  Yeah, I do agree with that, because what we have to understand, Michael, is that there is a two-pronged approach to this.
[01:52:16.342 --> 01:52:22.526]  You first have to secure your own spiritual and your own moral and your own mental sovereignty.
[01:52:22.967 --> 01:52:25.248]  And that, remember, is different for every person.
[01:52:25.288 --> 01:52:31.473]  That's why I do not, you know, subscribe to A to Z, fix all, one-size-fits-all, you know, systems here.
[01:52:31.753 --> 01:52:33.734]  This is a very individualistic study.
[01:52:33.774 --> 01:52:34.975]  It's an individualistic work.
[01:52:35.315 --> 01:52:39.118]  You have to use deconstructive models, just as much as you have to have
[01:52:39.560 --> 01:52:40.521]  Constructive models.
[01:52:40.961 --> 01:52:44.483]  You have to study your enemy to know what weapons they're using and how they're employing it.
[01:52:44.924 --> 01:52:52.328]  And it very much starts... See, I do never, I never separate any of this that we're talking about from spiritual activity.
[01:52:52.449 --> 01:52:54.970]  It is all part of... Yeah, let me make a point here.
[01:52:55.010 --> 01:52:56.571]  Let me make a point of your take on it, Michael.
[01:52:57.452 --> 01:53:06.178]  Whenever I'm threatened by the new world order, whenever things seem dark, I cannot even look at my own children, other people's children, innocence, goodness, beauty, a green field, the sky, the stars.
[01:53:06.818 --> 01:53:12.502]  And I know I'm part of something bigger, and I'm not trying to grasp and hold and be greedy, even with my own life.
[01:53:12.862 --> 01:53:23.029]  And then with that, a great peace comes over me, and I realize that I'm on the path of goodness and righteousness, not that I'm perfect, and so there's no more fear, but it's the willingness to fight.
[01:53:23.069 --> 01:53:24.970]  People say, oh, just don't be scared, go along with it.
[01:53:25.191 --> 01:53:29.393]  That's the ultimate form of surrender to evil.
[01:53:29.694 --> 01:53:34.457]  No, it is because I have love, and because I don't have fear, that I do stand up against evil.
[01:53:34.477 --> 01:53:35.998]  Do you see the point I'm making?
[01:53:37.174 --> 01:53:41.297]  I see it perfectly, and we owe a debt to all those individuals of the past.
[01:53:41.317 --> 01:53:53.945]  This is one of my strong motives, is that we owe a debt to all those people, all those children, even of our own family lines, who suffered in the mines, who suffered in the factories, who lost hands, who were maimed, who starved, who fought... Stay there!
[01:53:53.965 --> 01:53:54.365]  Start over!
[01:53:54.385 --> 01:53:55.506]  We've got to come back to the full audience.
[01:53:55.546 --> 01:53:55.806]  Here we go.
[01:54:02.105 --> 01:54:08.451]  Man, I would go into overdrive right now, but I've got to tape an interview with Tex Mars, myself, for his show, right when the show ends.
[01:54:08.471 --> 01:54:10.553]  I was on Man Cal this morning.
[01:54:13.268 --> 01:54:14.409]  They say no rest for the wicked.
[01:54:14.449 --> 01:54:15.349]  I'm not very wicked.
[01:54:15.369 --> 01:54:16.550]  I don't get very much rest.
[01:54:16.610 --> 01:54:17.630]  It's kind of the opposite.
[01:54:18.290 --> 01:54:27.655]  Michael Massarian, I was bringing up standing up against evil, how that is empowering, how once you just love humanity, that I think that's a big part of the solution.
[01:54:27.695 --> 01:54:33.978]  Just that mindset and idea, that truly turns loose of the fear, and then that empowers you, and you were making a key point.
[01:54:34.979 --> 01:54:41.342]  Well, see, Michael needs to come to understand that before you can help another person, you must be strong in yourself.
[01:54:41.863 --> 01:54:50.546]  And then from your model, pretty much like Alex, what you are walking an example of is by your model, people have the egalitarian right then to either do as you do or not to do as you do.
[01:54:50.866 --> 01:54:53.167]  You know, you can't force anything down people's throats.
[01:54:53.227 --> 01:54:54.807]  It's the example, it's the standard.
[01:54:55.768 --> 01:54:56.728]  It's the standard, exactly.
[01:54:56.788 --> 01:55:02.110]  And people who are sovereign within, who've understood that they can find their center, they can find their own inner truth.
[01:55:02.458 --> 01:55:04.380]  And as I said, that's not one-size-fits-all.
[01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:07.782]  It is not going to work on a social level where, you know, because again, that's regimentation.
[01:55:07.822 --> 01:55:08.883]  That's the fascist model.
[01:55:09.223 --> 01:55:12.746]  It's one-size-fits-all for all people, as we say, as we do, not as we act.
[01:55:13.207 --> 01:55:21.073]  So the most important thing is to realize that, yeah, you've got to go within yourself, into the sanctity and the kingdom of your own being, you know, and find your own center.
[01:55:21.113 --> 01:55:27.778]  And then from that place, in a total state of fearlessness and passion, take on the rival or the adversary, you know.
[01:55:28.219 --> 01:55:29.840]  And like I often say in my work,
[01:55:30.342 --> 01:55:38.104]  When you are so strong, I mean this is pretty much borrowed from martial arts, when you are so inherently strong that your enemy cannot destroy you, then your enemy has lost.
[01:55:38.544 --> 01:55:41.204]  You can't go after them using the tools that they've provided for you.
[01:55:41.484 --> 01:55:46.845]  You can't enter into this duel with the swords and the guns that they have primed and offered you.
[01:55:47.085 --> 01:55:49.506]  That has been tried in the past centuries and it hasn't worked.
[01:55:49.886 --> 01:55:58.508]  We have not been able to overcome this tyrant, this Leviathan, for the reasons that you mentioned, because we've not been able to break the spell of their particular kind of sorcery.
[01:55:58.548 --> 01:55:59.448]  That's absolutely right.
[01:55:59.668 --> 01:56:07.815]  But sir, you were bringing up before the break, when we were coming out, I want the full audience to hear it, about we owe it to our ancestors and the enslavement they went through.
[01:56:08.056 --> 01:56:08.716]  Finish that point.
[01:56:09.557 --> 01:56:13.961]  Well this is what my particular motive is, is that even if a person is not humanitarian enough, Alex,
[01:56:14.457 --> 01:56:15.838]  To do it for the rest of humanity?
[01:56:16.098 --> 01:56:16.698]  That's alright.
[01:56:17.018 --> 01:56:19.359]  Do it at least for the dead within your own family.
[01:56:19.439 --> 01:56:26.381]  The mothers, the grandparents, the grandfathers, the ancestors who died on the fields, who plowed, who suffered, who was murdered in wars.
[01:56:26.822 --> 01:56:28.662]  Wars of ritual, wars of blood.
[01:56:28.962 --> 01:56:29.142]  Right?
[01:56:29.202 --> 01:56:30.303]  These are your own ancestors.
[01:56:30.323 --> 01:56:33.924]  For goodness sake, people should be motivated to do it for your own lineage.
[01:56:34.184 --> 01:56:37.025]  The people who cried into the night saying, why is this happening to us?
[01:56:37.105 --> 01:56:39.046]  Why are we living in this month of abject poverty?
[01:56:39.366 --> 01:56:42.549]  Why are our sons and daughters dying on the field of these tyrants?
[01:56:42.569 --> 01:56:44.230]  So we should be motivated just by that.
[01:56:44.511 --> 01:56:53.438]  The incredible sorrow, the glee the enemy had at ripping babies apart, and enslaving, and the nobles loving the people, starving beneath them.
[01:56:54.999 --> 01:56:57.582]  The raw enjoyment of depriving people.
[01:56:57.922 --> 01:57:00.344]  I can't imagine that, but that's the enemy's soul.
[01:57:00.564 --> 01:57:01.525]  They love greed.
[01:57:01.565 --> 01:57:02.686]  They love hurting you.
[01:57:02.906 --> 01:57:04.788]  They are control freaks.
[01:57:05.993 --> 01:57:08.054]  And they can't wait to find another more innocent.
[01:57:08.074 --> 01:57:11.195]  You know, just like the 20 million Inca that were killed in South America.
[01:57:11.595 --> 01:57:12.836]  Or the Irish Genocide.
[01:57:13.116 --> 01:57:14.857]  Or the South African Genocide, you see.
[01:57:15.157 --> 01:57:19.759]  Or the opening of the British East India Company and the terrible degradation they did in India.
[01:57:20.099 --> 01:57:21.740]  They want to subjugate the entire world.
[01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:23.941]  They're trying it now over there in Iraq and Iran.
[01:57:24.321 --> 01:57:28.065]  You see, they don't look at you as an Iranian or as a... if you read their own works.
[01:57:28.305 --> 01:57:40.496]  If people go to their own works and go to the works of these people like the Albert Pike... They look at you as cattle, as an animal, as an insect that is to be eradicated and their religion is viciously tearing you apart.
[01:57:41.277 --> 01:57:41.637]  That's right.
[01:57:41.737 --> 01:57:43.778]  I mean, how many jugglers can you fit into one room?
[01:57:43.858 --> 01:57:46.099]  It doesn't matter, you see, who juggles what ball.
[01:57:46.219 --> 01:57:49.021]  Islamic, Judaic, Christian, Conservative, Labour.
[01:57:49.341 --> 01:57:51.582]  That is all for the juggling act of the world.
[01:57:51.702 --> 01:57:53.103]  It doesn't mean a thing to these people.
[01:57:53.143 --> 01:57:58.906]  They just look at you as basically fodder that can be ritually murdered whenever the time or the particular astrological...
[01:57:59.466 --> 01:58:02.788]  Michael, let me set you up the next few weeks for a part two, okay?
[01:58:16.445 --> 01:58:19.989]  Well let me get the, we're going to release our DVD and I'll make sure you get one and we can talk about that.
