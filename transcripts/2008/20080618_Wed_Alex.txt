[00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:08.194]  Alright folks, we are back at the Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:08.194 --> 00:00:11.755]  I hope everybody had a lovely evening and great morning.
[00:00:11.755 --> 00:00:18.359]  I'm Jason Bermas, I'm going to be sitting in this week.
[00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.320]  Alex will be joining us
[00:00:27.822 --> 00:00:32.746]  At the top of the next hour, in the first hour, we're going to be taking your calls.
[00:00:32.746 --> 00:00:40.093]  And I forgot to mention this yesterday, just because I got caught up with all the other news, and we're going to be going over that Oklahoma secession.
[00:00:40.093 --> 00:00:44.176]  By the way, I'm going to be reading the entire bill that passed, I believe, 92 to 3.
[00:00:44.176 --> 00:00:47.079]  God bless those good people.
[00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.022]  Anyway, the Austin Governor's Mansion.
[00:00:51.022 --> 00:00:55.446]  They are now saying it was politically motivated, and somebody who had a problem
[00:00:56.021 --> 00:00:58.282]  With the system or the governor.
[00:00:58.282 --> 00:01:00.343]  Weird.
[00:01:00.343 --> 00:01:02.984]  We're now more than a week deep into this thing.
[00:01:02.984 --> 00:01:04.084]  They say they have suspects.
[00:01:04.084 --> 00:01:07.745]  They say they have video, but they can't figure out who did it.
[00:01:07.745 --> 00:01:12.507]  The police were suspiciously missing when the event actually happened.
[00:01:12.507 --> 00:01:20.270]  It took, you know, 15, 20 minutes after the fire started for the firefighters to get there and another 10 to 15 minutes for the police to get there.
[00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.471]  And now they're saying it's politically motivated.
[00:01:23.988 --> 00:01:27.590]  How much do you want to bet that's going to be to restrict our freedoms?
[00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.691]  Pass new legislation?
[00:01:29.691 --> 00:01:33.273]  New police state measures?
[00:01:33.273 --> 00:01:36.595]  I can say it's almost a sure thing.
[00:01:36.595 --> 00:01:40.658]  So I think it was the final segment yesterday that somebody handed me this piece of paper.
[00:01:40.658 --> 00:01:41.638]  Oklahoma to Feds!
[00:01:41.638 --> 00:01:42.399]  Don't tread on me!
[00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.460]  This is off of World Net Daily.
[00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.541]  I really like those guys over at World Net Daily.
[00:01:46.541 --> 00:01:47.642]  They publish a lot of great stuff.
[00:01:49.116 --> 00:01:56.461]  Steamed over a perceived increase in federal usurping of states' rights, Oklahoma's House of Representatives told Washington, D.C.
[00:01:56.461 --> 00:01:58.362]  to back off.
[00:01:58.362 --> 00:02:12.392]  Joint Resolution 1089, passed by an overwhelming 92-3 margin, let me say it again, 92-3, reasserts Oklahoma's sovereignty under the 10th Amendment to the U.S.
[00:02:12.392 --> 00:02:12.952]  Constitution.
[00:02:12.952 --> 00:02:14.893]  Can you believe that?
[00:02:14.893 --> 00:02:17.215]  A state that actually does what it says with state rights?
[00:02:17.788 --> 00:02:20.509]  Knows what the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution is?
[00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:22.709]  It's unbelievable!
[00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:31.231]  And according to the resolution's own language, is serving notice to the federal government to cease and desist certain mandates.
[00:02:31.231 --> 00:02:42.934]  The Tenth Amendment states, the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.
[00:02:42.934 --> 00:02:44.414]  That's right, the people.
[00:02:44.414 --> 00:02:44.854]  You and me.
[00:02:46.055 --> 00:02:47.516]  This is great news.
[00:02:47.516 --> 00:02:50.757]  This makes me want to move to Oklahoma.
[00:02:50.757 --> 00:02:57.579]  Traditionally, this language has meant that the federal government is limited in its scope and cannot usurp the sovereign powers of states.
[00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:58.719]  That's the way it should be.
[00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:02.621]  That's why we have states' rights.
[00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:14.085]  In recent decades, however, as the size and reach of the federal government has expanded, many have come to question whether Washington has stepped on states' rights and gotten too big for its bridges.
[00:03:14.085 --> 00:03:15.005]  Of course it has!
[00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.430]  It's put the states on their knees, begging.
[00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.572]  I'm glad somebody stood up and said, wait a minute, we have the power.
[00:03:22.572 --> 00:03:24.212]  And this is the guy that stood up and did it.
[00:03:24.212 --> 00:03:29.535]  Charles Key, the Republican state representative who authored the resolution.
[00:03:29.535 --> 00:03:31.656]  Again, it's not about right or left.
[00:03:31.656 --> 00:03:33.536]  See, this is another thing they don't want to talk about.
[00:03:33.536 --> 00:03:38.178]  How many people on the Republican end that backed Kucinich's impeachment?
[00:03:38.178 --> 00:03:39.719]  They sponsored the bill.
[00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:40.119]  Okay.
[00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:44.621]  It's a Republican who puts out the bill to secede from Oklahoma.
[00:03:46.004 --> 00:03:48.425]  Let's see the whiny neocons try to play this one off.
[00:03:48.425 --> 00:03:50.685]  I'm sure it'll just totally be blacked out by the media.
[00:03:50.685 --> 00:03:55.706]  I know I didn't see anything in the coffee shop when I got my brew-ha-ha this morning.
[00:03:55.706 --> 00:04:01.928]  I didn't see anything about this, but I didn't look too hard, so I don't want to jump to any conclusions.
[00:04:01.928 --> 00:04:14.271]  Charles Key, the Republican state representative who authored the resolution, told WND, that's World Net Daily, that he introduced it because he believes the federal government's overstepping its bounds has put our constitutional form of government in danger.
[00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:16.498]  It's basically eviscerated it.
[00:04:16.498 --> 00:04:25.501]  The more we stand by and watch the federal government get involved in areas where it has no legal authority, we kill the Constitution a little at a time.
[00:04:25.501 --> 00:04:30.282]  The last few decades, the Constitution has been hanging by a thread.
[00:04:30.282 --> 00:04:32.102]  We're going to read the entire bill.
[00:04:32.102 --> 00:04:35.303]  Remember, Alex Jones is going to be with us, top of the hour, next hour.
[00:04:35.303 --> 00:04:36.263]  We're taking your phone calls.

[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.801]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:04:55.801 --> 00:04:59.403]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:04:59.403 --> 00:05:01.504]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:05:01.504 --> 00:05:04.905]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:05:04.905 --> 00:05:10.648]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:05:10.648 --> 00:05:14.550]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:18.879]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:18.879 --> 00:08:19.720]  Alright, we're back.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.401]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:21.401 --> 00:08:22.121]  I'm Jason Bermas.
[00:08:23.849 --> 00:08:27.432]  I'm producer on Loose Change, and I'll be sitting in for the rest of the week.
[00:08:27.432 --> 00:08:31.876]  And I do want to make it clear, you know, this doesn't mean that Oklahoma has totally seceded.
[00:08:31.876 --> 00:08:37.101]  This means the resolution has been passed, and now they're taking it to the next level.
[00:08:37.101 --> 00:08:43.066]  I'm not sure where it goes from here, but I will read the resolution on air.
[00:08:44.071 --> 00:08:55.773]  A joint resolution claiming sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States over certain powers serving notice to the federal government to cease and desist certain mandates and directing distribution.
[00:08:55.773 --> 00:09:10.176]  Whereas the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States reads as follows, the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people.
[00:09:10.176 --> 00:09:12.517]  And whereas the Tenth Amendment defines
[00:09:13.426 --> 00:09:20.668]  The total scope of federal power as being that specifically granted by the Constitution of the United States and no more.
[00:09:20.668 --> 00:09:32.111]  And, whereas, the scope of the power defined by the Tenth Amendment means that the federal government was created by the states specifically to be an agent of the states.
[00:09:32.111 --> 00:09:38.753]  And, whereas, today in 2008 the states are demonstrably treated as agents of the federal government.
[00:09:38.753 --> 00:09:41.894]  And, whereas, many federal mandates
[00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.370]  I don't
[00:09:59.602 --> 00:10:26.433]  uh... commandeer the legislative and regulatory process of the state and whereas a number of proposals from previous administrations and some now pending from the president uh... administration and from congress may further violate the constitution of the united states now therefore be resolved by the house of representatives and the senate of the second session of the fifty first oklahoma legislator that the state of oklahoma hereby claims sovereignty
[00:10:27.316 --> 00:10:37.527]  Under the 10th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States over all powers not otherwise enumerated and granted to the federal government by the Constitution of the United States.
[00:10:37.527 --> 00:10:50.400]  That this serve as notice and demand to the federal government as our agent to cease and desist effective immediately mandates that are beyond the scope of these constitutionally delegated powers.
[00:10:51.072 --> 00:11:10.436]  That a copy of this resolution be distributed to the President of the United States, the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the Speaker of the House of the President of the Senate, of each state's legislator of the United States of America, and each member of Oklahoma Congressional Delegation.
[00:11:10.436 --> 00:11:11.896]  So there it is in its own language.
[00:11:11.896 --> 00:11:18.097]  Take it as, uh, as you will.
[00:11:18.097 --> 00:11:18.637]  I think it's great.
[00:11:19.232 --> 00:11:21.473]  I think it shows that we do have incredible powers.
[00:11:21.473 --> 00:11:28.376]  It shows that the federal government doesn't have the kibosh on the people that they would like.
[00:11:28.376 --> 00:11:31.117]  It doesn't have that iron fist.
[00:11:31.117 --> 00:11:32.878]  There are still some freethinkers out there.
[00:11:32.878 --> 00:11:43.062]  There are still some people who are caught up in politics on the right-left scale, on the Democrat-Republican scale, that do care.
[00:11:43.062 --> 00:11:45.243]  I mean, we had Paul Gregg Roberts on yesterday.
[00:11:45.243 --> 00:11:46.504]  I may not agree with everything he says.
[00:11:46.504 --> 00:11:47.504]  I think he's a smart guy.
[00:11:47.504 --> 00:11:48.845]  I think he's very informed.
[00:11:49.431 --> 00:12:00.679]  I've noticed that a lot of people who have actually served in administrations, I'm not going to name names right now, but a couple people who were in my film, they really are big time against the Israeli lobby.
[00:12:00.679 --> 00:12:04.241]  They feel like that's the numero uno problem.
[00:12:04.241 --> 00:12:13.147]  But I see that as, you know, they butted heads with these people many a times when they were in office and they've seen what our policy looks like in the Middle East.
[00:12:13.147 --> 00:12:17.830]  But if you notice, yesterday when I brought up the Paul Craig Roberts, that
[00:12:18.931 --> 00:12:29.354]  On Friday the mainstream news had reported that a prison was attacked and a thousand militants got out, 400 of them Taliban.
[00:12:29.354 --> 00:12:47.599]  By Monday the Taliban had a stronghold again in Afghanistan, that was CNN, and by Monday afternoon it came out that US forces gave quote-unquote the green light for that attack to take place so those Taliban could scurry about Afghanistan and we could have an excuse to stay there for another five to ten years.
[00:12:48.502 --> 00:12:49.982]  Okay?
[00:12:49.982 --> 00:12:51.122]  Now, he didn't want to talk about that.
[00:12:51.122 --> 00:12:56.143]  He didn't want to talk about, basically, an op.
[00:12:56.143 --> 00:12:57.244]  That's an op.
[00:12:57.244 --> 00:12:58.624]  That's an op for us to stay there.
[00:12:58.624 --> 00:13:08.946]  All the policy in the world, okay, between us and Israel isn't going to stop that if our government continues to provocate matters in the Middle East so they can stay there.
[00:13:08.946 --> 00:13:13.946]  It's just like when those UK soldiers, I think that's all the way back in 2004 now, maybe 2005, were caught
[00:13:17.745 --> 00:13:22.566]  Dressed as Arabs, ready to blow up a mosque.
[00:13:22.566 --> 00:13:37.669]  Okay, when they were detained, by the time that the UK military actually got there to get them out of the prison, and the people who were running the prison already knew to let them go.
[00:13:37.669 --> 00:13:39.710]  Think about that.
[00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:43.130]  I mean, I really want you to think about that.
[00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:45.851]  They let them go.
[00:13:45.851 --> 00:13:46.071]  Why?
[00:13:46.357 --> 00:13:52.821]  Well, they knew that if they didn't let him go, British troops were just going to come in and destroy their prison anyway, maybe kill them.
[00:13:52.821 --> 00:13:54.401]  So they wanted to preempt that.
[00:13:54.401 --> 00:13:55.462]  They know how it goes there.
[00:13:55.462 --> 00:14:01.125]  It's just like, it comes out that the United States aided in the attack on the prison.
[00:14:01.125 --> 00:14:02.226]  The commoners don't know it.
[00:14:02.226 --> 00:14:04.267]  The people who aren't politically involved don't know it.
[00:14:04.267 --> 00:14:06.248]  They think it's all these bad insurgents.
[00:14:06.248 --> 00:14:08.449]  Why can't they just stop?
[00:14:08.449 --> 00:14:09.470]  Why can't they just stop?
[00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:15.253]  But anybody with any political mind over there is like, oh my God, I can't believe the United States is endorsing this.
[00:14:15.891 --> 00:14:18.333]  I can't believe the United States is behind this.
[00:14:18.333 --> 00:14:26.319]  I can't believe that the United States is not only allowing this to happen, but probably helping it.
[00:14:26.319 --> 00:14:29.801]  Well, I can believe it, because they have no intention of bringing our boys home.
[00:14:29.801 --> 00:14:32.003]  Barack Obama, give me a break.
[00:14:32.003 --> 00:14:33.664]  Give me a break.
[00:14:33.664 --> 00:14:38.588]  This guy is bad news, and he's bad news because he's well-spoken.
[00:14:38.588 --> 00:14:42.791]  People really do believe that he is, quote-unquote, change you can vote for.
[00:14:42.791 --> 00:14:43.652]  Change you can vote for.
[00:14:43.652 --> 00:14:44.092]  Sounds great.
[00:14:45.311 --> 00:14:47.832]  He's not going to change anything.
[00:14:47.832 --> 00:14:51.954]  And personally I'm not down with a soft fascism either.
[00:14:51.954 --> 00:14:54.955]  You know, I'm not down with a soft style police state.
[00:14:54.955 --> 00:15:01.097]  I'm not down with somebody who's going to be able to lie to my face and fool eighty to ninety percent of the people because he is well-spoken.
[00:15:01.097 --> 00:15:03.358]  I don't need another Bill Clinton out there.
[00:15:03.358 --> 00:15:04.898]  You know what I'm saying?
[00:15:04.898 --> 00:15:05.479]  You know what I'm saying?
[00:15:05.479 --> 00:15:10.360]  I mean, it's absolutely ridiculous.
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:14.382]  But people are falling into it and he's the lesser of two evils and
[00:15:15.495 --> 00:15:16.976]  I think it's both.
[00:15:16.976 --> 00:15:18.336]  I don't think he's the lesser of two evils.
[00:15:18.336 --> 00:15:21.057]  I think he's the slicker of two evils.
[00:15:21.057 --> 00:15:36.362]  John McCain is just so overt in his fear-mongering, in his war-mongering, in his bomb, bomb, bomb Iran, in his pro-torture stance, parroting that it's a huge mistake that we let habeas corpus pass.
[00:15:36.362 --> 00:15:40.964]  I can't believe that the Supreme Court would give them the right to face their accuser.
[00:15:40.964 --> 00:15:43.265]  It's a sad day for America.
[00:15:43.265 --> 00:15:44.285]  No, actually,
[00:15:44.855 --> 00:15:47.857]  Thank the Lord that it did pass.
[00:15:47.857 --> 00:15:51.560]  It's scary that it only passed five to four.
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:56.543]  And what's what's the problem with us being able to face our accusers?
[00:15:56.543 --> 00:16:01.487]  It's a standard right, you know, from the Magna Carta back in the twelve hundreds.
[00:16:01.487 --> 00:16:02.768]  Right.
[00:16:02.768 --> 00:16:08.632]  I mean, I think we should have that right to redress the grievances against us.
[00:16:08.632 --> 00:16:13.055]  You know, you know, you're the body and I'm sorry, I'm the body.
[00:16:13.055 --> 00:16:14.016]  What are you charging me with?
[00:16:14.494 --> 00:16:15.715]  What are you charging me with?
[00:16:15.715 --> 00:16:16.496]  And they're all upset.
[00:16:16.496 --> 00:16:21.779]  I mean, Newt Gingrich gets on mainstream media and says, Oh, now a whole U.S.
[00:16:21.779 --> 00:16:23.341]  city is going to blow up.
[00:16:23.341 --> 00:16:24.601]  Really?
[00:16:24.601 --> 00:16:28.604]  A city is going to blow up because we have habeas corpus.
[00:16:28.604 --> 00:16:30.126]  That makes absolutely no sense.
[00:16:30.126 --> 00:16:34.949]  It makes zero sense, folks.
[00:16:34.949 --> 00:16:38.332]  We have a common God given right, and that's what's going to blow up the city.
[00:16:38.332 --> 00:16:42.915]  No, it's going to be your little minions in special ops, your little international
[00:16:43.285 --> 00:16:43.665]  I don't know.
[00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:07.931]  You know, he's the politically motivated guy.
[00:17:07.931 --> 00:17:09.232]  He's the guy.
[00:17:09.232 --> 00:17:13.275]  So now it's white people who are in Al Qaeda, blonde people that are in Al Qaeda.
[00:17:13.275 --> 00:17:15.036]  It doesn't even have to be Middle Eastern.
[00:17:15.036 --> 00:17:17.978]  I bet they don't even have to be jihadists.
[00:17:17.978 --> 00:17:19.879]  We know that they're running drills now.
[00:17:19.879 --> 00:17:24.823]  And by the way, I brought up those Denver drills yesterday.
[00:17:24.823 --> 00:17:28.725]  Jonathan from We Are Change Colorado got us a bunch of great footage.
[00:17:28.725 --> 00:17:30.346]  He should be sending that out in the next two days.
[00:17:30.346 --> 00:17:35.790]  About urban warfare drills, black helicopters, Apaches.
[00:17:36.897 --> 00:17:40.658]  Detention centers, the whole nine yards.
[00:17:40.658 --> 00:17:55.462]  Current military, former military, working with the police, right now, as we speak, in Denver, running massive drills, and they're denying it in some publications that it's for the DNC.
[00:17:55.462 --> 00:17:56.943]  But let's be honest.
[00:17:56.943 --> 00:18:00.544]  It is, uh, you know, let's be real.
[00:18:00.544 --> 00:18:01.724]  It's for the DNC.
[00:18:01.724 --> 00:18:03.705]  They'd love to provoke a torrid event there.
[00:18:03.705 --> 00:18:05.085]  That's why a lot of us have to go out there.
[00:18:05.828 --> 00:18:15.254]  You know, if you're not doing anything or you're in the, uh, Denver area, I gotta tell you, you need to figure out a way out there.
[00:18:15.254 --> 00:18:16.655]  You need to go there.
[00:18:16.655 --> 00:18:17.976]  You need to peacefully protest.
[00:18:17.976 --> 00:18:19.957]  You need to bring a hundred DVDs you burned.
[00:18:19.957 --> 00:18:33.806]  You need to hand them out to other people and people you feel that you can reach out that aren't the provocateurs that are being provocateur toward into wearing masks, carrying paint, destroying cameras, basically trying to, uh, stop our free speech.
[00:18:33.806 --> 00:18:34.707]  You need to explain to them,
[00:18:35.959 --> 00:18:41.323]  That the group that first put this together, Recreate68, WANTED violence.
[00:18:41.323 --> 00:18:44.185]  They WANTED violence, okay?
[00:18:44.185 --> 00:18:45.626]  Now that group's done.
[00:18:45.626 --> 00:18:52.391]  But I hear the group that they've put together, and these are the only group that got a permit to protest, weird.
[00:18:52.391 --> 00:19:04.840]  None of the peaceful groups were welcome to protest, but the ones that, you know, put out a PDF file about how you need to build a shield and wear armor and throw paint at people, they're the ones that get the permit, okay?
[00:19:05.285 --> 00:19:07.986]  So now they've changed their name.
[00:19:07.986 --> 00:19:10.968]  You know, different name, probably same old tricks.
[00:19:10.968 --> 00:19:12.068]  We can't let this happen.
[00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:16.871]  It happened in 2000 at the World Trade Organization in Seattle.
[00:19:16.871 --> 00:19:17.671]  And what did they do?
[00:19:17.671 --> 00:19:22.333]  They created huge zones where you couldn't even wear a button against the WTO.
[00:19:22.333 --> 00:19:24.374]  No free speech.
[00:19:24.374 --> 00:19:26.115]  Zero free speech.
[00:19:26.115 --> 00:19:29.077]  That's not what this country's about.
[00:19:29.077 --> 00:19:32.518]  In fact, this country's about, you know, being able to secede from the Union if you want.
[00:19:32.518 --> 00:19:33.899]  Now, they haven't seceded yet, folks, but
[00:19:34.457 --> 00:19:35.197]  Go Oklahoma!
[00:19:35.197 --> 00:19:36.638]  We're going to take your calls.
[00:19:36.638 --> 00:19:37.698]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:37.698 --> 00:19:38.939]  I'm Jason Bermas.
[00:19:38.939 --> 00:19:39.939]  Infowars.com.
[00:19:39.939 --> 00:19:41.180]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:19:54.195 --> 00:19:57.956]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[00:19:57.956 --> 00:20:02.677]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[00:20:02.677 --> 00:20:07.979]  I have run across a company called SFR, who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[00:20:07.979 --> 00:20:19.202]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, Protecta Complete Fuel System Treatment cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage in only one tank full.
[00:20:19.202 --> 00:20:21.543]  Protecta Engine Treatment not only reduces friction,
[00:20:21.963 --> 00:20:24.005]  But it extends the life of your engine.
[00:20:24.005 --> 00:20:24.925]  Let's face it.
[00:20:24.925 --> 00:20:27.768]  With the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[00:20:27.768 --> 00:20:35.774]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment which is a $12.95 value free.
[00:20:35.774 --> 00:20:38.076]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:20:38.076 --> 00:20:41.198]  That number again is 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:20:41.198 --> 00:20:45.261]  Or check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com.
[00:20:45.261 --> 00:20:47.443]  That's oilcompanysecret.com.

[00:20:51.708 --> 00:20:54.292]  Act now.
[00:20:54.292 --> 00:20:55.694]  It is a big idea.
[00:20:55.694 --> 00:20:58.539]  A new world order.
[00:20:58.539 --> 00:21:02.966]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:06.253]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:21:06.253 --> 00:21:09.037]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:21:09.037 --> 00:21:12.221]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:21:12.221 --> 00:21:19.550]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:21:22.574 --> 00:21:28.018]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:21:28.018 --> 00:21:31.901]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:21:31.901 --> 00:21:34.463]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:21:34.463 --> 00:21:35.624]  Most people have no idea.
[00:21:35.624 --> 00:21:36.405]  They're not after money.
[00:21:36.405 --> 00:21:37.686]  They have all the money they need.
[00:21:37.686 --> 00:21:38.666]  They're after power.
[00:21:38.666 --> 00:21:39.807]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:03.866]  A world economic collapse could come any day.
[00:23:03.866 --> 00:23:04.727]  Question.
[00:23:04.727 --> 00:23:09.993]  Are you prepared or are you ignoring the signs?
[00:23:09.993 --> 00:23:10.773]  Question.

[00:24:02.054 --> 00:24:08.557]  Beautiful friend.
[00:24:08.557 --> 00:24:11.558]  This is the end.
[00:24:11.558 --> 00:24:14.059]  My only friend.
[00:24:14.059 --> 00:24:15.059]  The end.
[00:24:15.059 --> 00:24:20.301]  Of all the elaborate plans.
[00:24:20.301 --> 00:24:22.722]  The end.
[00:24:22.722 --> 00:24:26.304]  Of everything that stands.
[00:24:26.304 --> 00:24:28.385]  The end.
[00:24:28.385 --> 00:24:29.425]  No safe
[00:24:30.809 --> 00:24:33.030]  Alright folks, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:34.531]  I am Jason Bermas.
[00:24:34.531 --> 00:24:37.713]  I'm gonna be with you for, uh, at least today, maybe for the next couple days.
[00:24:37.713 --> 00:24:38.173]  I'm not sure.
[00:24:38.173 --> 00:24:39.314]  They might run some replays.
[00:24:39.314 --> 00:24:44.637]  But Alex is gonna be joining us in about 30 minutes.
[00:24:44.637 --> 00:24:46.098]  Let's take some calls.
[00:24:46.098 --> 00:24:49.540]  Let's see what the people have to say about this Oklahoma situation.
[00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:52.061]  The Austin Fire, if you will.
[00:24:52.061 --> 00:24:55.063]  Remember, it's somebody who is politically motivated now.
[00:24:55.063 --> 00:24:55.883]  Very bizarre.
[00:24:55.883 --> 00:24:57.564]  Let's go to Rob in California.
[00:24:57.564 --> 00:24:58.825]  Rob, are you there?
[00:24:58.825 --> 00:24:59.285]  Yeah, Jason.
[00:25:00.283 --> 00:25:07.890]  Um, I'm not, uh, I was calling in, well I'm calling in about, um, a call you had about two days ago, so it's not really on the topic.
[00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:09.532]  Okay, sure, go ahead.
[00:25:09.532 --> 00:25:09.732]  Cool.
[00:25:09.732 --> 00:25:16.639]  I was really concerned, uh, with the way you handled, uh, the call with the lady who was calling in to talk about aliens.
[00:25:16.639 --> 00:25:19.502]  My God, man, cut him off, cut him off!
[00:25:19.502 --> 00:25:23.225]  Listen, we don't talk about aliens on the show.
[00:25:23.225 --> 00:25:24.606]  Look, alright?
[00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:35.014]  There is no hard evidence of any sort, okay, that there are grey aliens, that there are reptoid blood-drinking lizards out there.
[00:25:35.014 --> 00:25:36.114]  It's garbage!
[00:25:36.114 --> 00:25:38.635]  I can't even believe I'm spending any time on this.
[00:25:38.635 --> 00:25:40.976]  Look, it's a political news show.
[00:25:40.976 --> 00:25:42.697]  We don't talk about aliens.
[00:25:42.697 --> 00:25:43.638]  Stop it.
[00:25:43.638 --> 00:25:48.940]  Stop calling in and trying to get me to talk about flying saucers and space martians.
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:49.901]  I'm done with it.
[00:25:49.901 --> 00:25:52.082]  Alright, let's go to Reb in Colorado.
[00:25:52.082 --> 00:25:52.642]  Reb, are you with me?
[00:25:53.427 --> 00:25:54.388]  Yeah, I'm right here.
[00:25:54.388 --> 00:25:55.168]  Hi, how are you?
[00:25:55.168 --> 00:25:56.409]  I'm all right, man.
[00:25:56.409 --> 00:25:57.169]  That's a little frustrating.
[00:25:57.169 --> 00:25:58.450]  We've got an update for you.
[00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:12.159]  We've got what's going on for you at the Denver downtown area, and we give out, all you gotta do is put in Google the words, Office of Counterintelligence, U.S.
[00:26:12.159 --> 00:26:15.561]  Pentagon, or in search Yahoo.
[00:26:15.561 --> 00:26:17.062]  How's that?
[00:26:17.062 --> 00:26:18.063]  Okay, what are they looking for?
[00:26:18.795 --> 00:26:21.817]  Oh, it'll explain what's going on in downtown Denver.
[00:26:21.817 --> 00:26:31.744]  When you, yay, who's even better than Google, and both of them explain the exact situation that the public broadcast doesn't tell you about.
[00:26:31.744 --> 00:26:37.208]  And if you type in, like I said, you gotta type in Office of Counterintelligence, U.S.
[00:26:37.208 --> 00:26:38.089]  Pentagon.
[00:26:38.089 --> 00:26:47.476]  When you see the big, bold letters as you scan down the page, and you click on it, and it gives you the name of where to go under
[00:26:47.972 --> 00:26:52.295]  The, uh, where you see the big letters, and it'll tell you all the information.
[00:26:52.295 --> 00:26:59.080]  Like, our team actually found the headquarters of the group called Recreate 68.
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:02.583]  It's at 1290 Marion Street in Denver.
[00:27:02.583 --> 00:27:04.564]  They don't have a phone number.
[00:27:04.564 --> 00:27:13.111]  And what they do, they link with the local broadcasters in the area when the violence is going to take place.
[00:27:13.111 --> 00:27:17.234]  And they'll be, you know, making problems for everybody there.
[00:27:17.794 --> 00:27:21.435]  And they, of course, are infiltrated, as you well know.
[00:27:21.435 --> 00:27:23.476]  I mean, you've alluded to that.
[00:27:23.476 --> 00:27:26.017]  Yeah, well, they've broken up, actually, Reb.
[00:27:26.017 --> 00:27:27.117]  Thanks for the call.
[00:27:27.117 --> 00:27:32.199]  Like I said, there's a new organization, I guess, and I don't trust them either.
[00:27:32.199 --> 00:27:38.701]  You know, I feel like they're already excluding We Are Changers, and they don't want a peaceful protest.
[00:27:38.701 --> 00:27:40.622]  I think that they want violence.
[00:27:40.622 --> 00:27:42.202]  You know, it's the same people.
[00:27:42.202 --> 00:27:44.243]  All right, let's go to Ken in Boston.
[00:27:44.243 --> 00:27:46.804]  Ken, are you with us?
[00:27:46.804 --> 00:27:47.184]  Ken, are you there?
[00:27:48.737 --> 00:27:49.277]  Jason?
[00:27:49.277 --> 00:27:49.998]  Yes.
[00:27:49.998 --> 00:27:53.319]  Yes, you're doing a great job there.
[00:27:53.319 --> 00:27:54.179]  One quick note.
[00:27:54.179 --> 00:27:59.222]  You know, all these groups, when they get exposed, they just change their name.
[00:27:59.222 --> 00:28:01.823]  I mean, it's kind of a common tactic.
[00:28:01.823 --> 00:28:08.345]  I did want to comment, however, on Representative Charles Key.
[00:28:08.345 --> 00:28:16.649]  Now, a lot of folks may not remember this or know in the first place, but he was the one who really pushed
[00:28:17.168 --> 00:28:19.529]  Yes, I would imagine he is a good man.
[00:28:19.529 --> 00:28:23.611]  I mean, to put something like this together and then, well, it looks like the people are awake.
[00:28:23.611 --> 00:28:25.531]  I mean, 92 to 3, only 3 people voted against it.
[00:28:25.531 --> 00:28:29.593]  It's very encouraging.
[00:28:40.599 --> 00:28:45.764]  Absolutely, but he pushed very, very hard for the report.
[00:28:45.764 --> 00:28:49.588]  He actually did one called the Final Report that exposed everything.
[00:28:49.588 --> 00:28:54.772]  All of the big points that the media just wouldn't touch.
[00:28:54.772 --> 00:28:55.973]  Very similar to 9-11.
[00:28:55.973 --> 00:28:57.495]  Now, by the way, O.K.C.
[00:28:57.495 --> 00:29:03.701]  was my awakening into false flag terror.
[00:29:03.701 --> 00:29:06.163]  And, you know, real funny, just another quick note on that.
[00:29:07.324 --> 00:29:18.412]  Charles Keating, the governor of Oklahoma, his brother Martin wrote the book, The Last Jihad, two years before the actual event happened.
[00:29:18.412 --> 00:29:24.057]  That's very true, and that's Tom McVeigh blowing up the Oklahoma City building, the final jihad.
[00:29:24.057 --> 00:29:25.958]  Very bizarre, huh?
[00:29:25.958 --> 00:29:27.699]  I wonder how he had the foresight for that.
[00:29:27.699 --> 00:29:28.700]  Thanks for the call, Ken.
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:30.461]  We're going to continue to take your calls on the other side.
[00:29:30.461 --> 00:29:31.682]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:31.682 --> 00:29:33.303]  PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com.
[00:29:44.369 --> 00:29:48.301]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:48.301 --> 00:29:50.969]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:54.286 --> 00:29:57.148]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:29:57.148 --> 00:29:58.709]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[00:29:58.709 --> 00:30:00.850]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:02.751]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:30:02.751 --> 00:30:04.252]  The late great USA.
[00:30:04.252 --> 00:30:06.013]  America, freedom to fascism.
[00:30:06.013 --> 00:30:13.037]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[00:30:40.926 --> 00:30:42.487]  Wake up, Protestant America!
[00:30:42.487 --> 00:30:45.509]  There is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state.
[00:30:45.509 --> 00:30:49.311]  This Confederation of Evangelicals, Catholics and Protestant denominations
[00:31:02.639 --> 00:31:02.919]  I'm good.
[00:31:22.461 --> 00:31:25.063]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement.
[00:31:25.063 --> 00:31:30.366]  From history we saw that when church and state united, known as Papal Rome, religious intolerance resulted.
[00:31:30.366 --> 00:31:34.029]  This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation.
[00:31:34.029 --> 00:31:36.831]  America and Papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[00:31:36.831 --> 00:31:39.592]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late!
[00:31:39.592 --> 00:31:41.534]  The prophecies are fast fulfilling.
[00:31:41.534 --> 00:31:43.115]  Jesus is coming soon!
[00:31:43.115 --> 00:31:44.456]  For free materials call 888-211-1715.

[00:31:53.502 --> 00:31:54.202]  We're good to go.
[00:32:11.531 --> 00:32:20.939]  Oxysilver, developed by NASA scientists to keep astronauts healthy, is an evolutionary new dietary supplement making deadly vaccinations and antibiotics obsolete.
[00:32:20.939 --> 00:32:25.603]  Taking one to two teaspoons daily boosts natural immunity without drug toxicity.
[00:32:25.603 --> 00:32:28.726]  Oxysilver combines oxygen and silver in a new way.
[00:32:28.726 --> 00:32:34.831]  The oxygen becomes a supercharged germ killer freeing your immune system to fight colds, flus, cancers and more.
[00:32:35.151 --> 00:32:35.511]  We're good to go!
[00:33:37.718 --> 00:33:38.658]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:38.658 --> 00:33:40.759]  We are back and we're going to keep on taking your calls.
[00:33:40.759 --> 00:33:42.440]  I am Jason Bermas.
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:45.121]  You can check my stuff out over at loosechange911.com.
[00:33:45.121 --> 00:33:46.442]  I post a little blog.
[00:33:46.442 --> 00:33:49.803]  I just put up 10 minutes of the show yesterday.
[00:33:49.803 --> 00:33:51.324]  Let's go to Richard in Texas.
[00:33:52.941 --> 00:33:54.421]  Richard, are you with us?
[00:33:54.421 --> 00:33:55.562]  Yes.
[00:33:55.562 --> 00:33:57.662]  What's on your mind, Richard?
[00:33:57.662 --> 00:34:04.704]  I'm just going to give a heads up of a TV show that's going to be on Friday and Saturday night.
[00:34:04.704 --> 00:34:09.425]  If they allow it to come back on, it's called The Summit.
[00:34:09.425 --> 00:34:11.626]  It's a four hour miniseries.
[00:34:11.626 --> 00:34:15.787]  And I swear, I thought Alex was a consultant for this show.
[00:34:15.787 --> 00:34:19.728]  I've never seen anything like this as a regular movie on TV in my life.
[00:34:19.728 --> 00:34:22.109]  And I really doubt that they'll show it again.
[00:34:22.946 --> 00:34:26.527]  Well, what was so special about it?
[00:34:26.527 --> 00:34:30.548]  It's about a smallpox outbreak in Colombia.
[00:34:30.548 --> 00:34:32.428]  How it's all orchestrated.
[00:34:32.428 --> 00:34:35.849]  They have a summit in Canada.
[00:34:35.849 --> 00:34:38.790]  How they put in anarchists.
[00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:44.851]  I mean, it's just... So it's the government provocatoring a biological attack and using anarchists as the patsies.
[00:34:45.419 --> 00:35:04.533]  Oh yeah, and it goes all the way up to the top of the White House, and it shows... Well they did this not so long ago with that show Jericho, they let off 20 plus nukes in American cities everywhere, they blamed the Iranians and the Koreans working with anarchists within the country, and then it later comes out that in actuality the program was
[00:35:05.555 --> 00:35:12.439]  Uh, put out there by Berkeley and Jensen, I believe, a, uh, private corporation, and the head of, uh, the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:35:12.439 --> 00:35:13.299]  Very bizarre.
[00:35:13.299 --> 00:35:16.221]  And, uh, this show also got cancelled a couple times.
[00:35:16.221 --> 00:35:17.662]  They kinda wrapped it up.
[00:35:17.662 --> 00:35:19.783]  I don't s- I don't think it's gonna be back on the air.
[00:35:19.783 --> 00:35:21.564]  But yeah, uh, people are waking up.
[00:35:21.564 --> 00:35:22.284]  People are putting it up.
[00:35:22.284 --> 00:35:23.685]  I hope it's not to soften us up.
[00:35:23.685 --> 00:35:28.348]  I mean, people like Alan Watt out there will say, it's there to acclimate us to this.
[00:35:28.348 --> 00:35:29.368]  I hope it's warning us.
[00:35:29.368 --> 00:35:31.229]  Let's go to Steven in L.A.
[00:35:31.229 --> 00:35:33.711]  Steven, are you there?
[00:35:33.711 --> 00:35:34.271]  Steven, are you with us?
[00:35:35.109 --> 00:35:35.549]  I'm here.
[00:35:35.549 --> 00:35:36.309]  Can you hear me?
[00:35:36.309 --> 00:35:36.669]  Absolutely.
[00:35:36.669 --> 00:35:37.970]  What's on your mind?
[00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:38.870]  Oh, hi, Jason.
[00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:40.210]  This is Steven Benson.
[00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:46.412]  We shared a table over at the Freedom Conference in San Diego a few months back.
[00:35:46.412 --> 00:35:49.073]  I was working on Real Idea at the time.
[00:35:49.073 --> 00:35:55.295]  And yeah, I wanted to talk to you about a new project that I'm working on, the Great American Walk for Freedom.
[00:35:55.295 --> 00:35:59.516]  And you can check it out at walkforfreedom.org.
[00:35:59.516 --> 00:36:01.236]  Walk the number for freedom.org.
[00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:14.137]  We're going to be walking from Green Bay, Wisconsin, and Ames, Iowa, all the way to Minneapolis.
[00:36:14.137 --> 00:36:16.959]  And we'll be spreading the message of freedom.
[00:36:16.959 --> 00:36:30.648]  Basically, this is starting from the Ron Paul movement, and we'll be, you know, just informing people about the Constitution, the fact that we no longer have one in this country, and that it needs to be restored.
[00:36:31.315 --> 00:36:36.557]  And it's a public educational and organizational campaign.
[00:36:36.557 --> 00:36:42.719]  People are going to walk 280 miles in 21 days and about three weeks.
[00:36:42.719 --> 00:36:55.763]  It's the same length of walk and length of time that Gandhi walked when he walked to the sea to break the British tax on salt.
[00:36:55.763 --> 00:36:57.583]  And so it's a pretty dramatic thing.
[00:36:57.583 --> 00:36:58.864]  It's going to be in the dead of summer.
[00:37:01.014 --> 00:37:03.315]  Where can people find the information for this?
[00:37:03.315 --> 00:37:06.937]  It's walk4freedom.org.
[00:37:06.937 --> 00:37:09.018]  The number 4, not F-O-R.
[00:37:09.018 --> 00:37:11.319]  Walk4freedom.org.
[00:37:11.319 --> 00:37:12.980]  You can sign up to walk there.
[00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:14.920]  You can sign up to volunteer.
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:16.401]  We need lots of help.
[00:37:16.401 --> 00:37:23.364]  We're going to have a fleet of RVs that are going to serve as mobile dormitories, mess halls, bathrooms.
[00:37:25.172 --> 00:37:30.596]  And we need people to drive the RVs, to take care of logistics, food and water.
[00:37:30.596 --> 00:37:31.217]  Excellent, Steven.
[00:37:31.217 --> 00:37:33.498]  I hope people go and check that out.
[00:37:33.498 --> 00:37:37.481]  And, you know, I'm all about things that are promoting the truth, so hopefully we can get that together.
[00:37:37.481 --> 00:37:37.962]  Go check it out.
[00:37:37.962 --> 00:37:40.003]  Let's go to Josh in California.
[00:37:40.003 --> 00:37:40.784]  Josh, you with us?
[00:37:40.784 --> 00:37:41.564]  Hey, how's it going?
[00:37:41.564 --> 00:37:41.885]  Good, man.
[00:37:41.885 --> 00:37:43.066]  What's up?
[00:37:43.066 --> 00:37:47.109]  I wanted to maybe go through a couple ideas about this whole Oklahoma thing.
[00:37:47.109 --> 00:37:48.210]  Let's do it.
[00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:52.613]  I found out about it like two days ago, and it was probably, I think it's one of the best
[00:37:53.471 --> 00:38:16.902]  It turns for the better we've seen in your country as far as the state taking responsibility against the federal government, but I also think that there's a chance that it might set the stage for the opportunity for the federal government to unroll the military upon the state of Oklahoma, putting it under martial law, forcing it to stay a part of the United States.
[00:38:16.902 --> 00:38:20.184]  So you think that it sets the stage for martial law to be completely
[00:38:21.175 --> 00:38:29.361]  So you think that this is a ploy, you know, this is a ploy for the states to resist and then the federal government to come in and maybe declare martial law against them?
[00:38:29.361 --> 00:38:33.344]  Well, because what they're going to want to do is they're saying, like, they're saying to the government, back off.
[00:38:33.344 --> 00:38:37.107]  We don't want you telling us what to do anymore.
[00:38:37.107 --> 00:38:42.151]  And I think if we've seen by the government's actions in the past that they're going to do it by force.
[00:38:42.151 --> 00:38:43.311]  They'll take control by force.
[00:38:44.676 --> 00:38:46.977]  Well, I'm hoping that you're wrong, man.
[00:38:46.977 --> 00:39:00.865]  I mean, obviously that's a possibility, and we'll keep our eyes open for that, but I mean, I honestly think this is a positive thing, and I think the federal government would get a huge amount of flack if they started rolling tanks down in Oklahoma.
[00:39:00.865 --> 00:39:01.986]  I mean, I could be wrong.
[00:39:01.986 --> 00:39:07.489]  The media is great at blacking things out and spinning things, but let's hope it doesn't come to that.
[00:39:07.489 --> 00:39:09.110]  What are your other thoughts on it?
[00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:11.712]  I think it's a good thing.
[00:39:13.206 --> 00:39:22.633]  I really do, and it'll be interesting to see how much the people literally have to take to the streets and stand up for what they believe in to make this happen.
[00:39:22.633 --> 00:39:23.234]  I'm with you, man.
[00:39:23.234 --> 00:39:24.975]  Thank you for the call.
[00:39:24.975 --> 00:39:28.738]  Let's jump to John in Wyoming.
[00:39:28.738 --> 00:39:29.579]  Hi, Jason.
[00:39:29.579 --> 00:39:30.079]  How you doing, man?
[00:39:30.079 --> 00:39:30.980]  What's on your mind?
[00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:32.221]  I'm pretty good.
[00:39:32.221 --> 00:39:41.068]  Living up here in Cheyenne, I get, of course, all the Denver channels on cable, and I've been watching all of these so-called terrorist drills going on in Denver since Sunday.
[00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:44.881]  And they were talking about on Channel 2 and Channel 7.
[00:39:44.881 --> 00:39:52.184]  And by the way, Channel 7's website that has a lot of good photos is thedenverchannel.com.
[00:39:52.184 --> 00:39:55.485]  That's thedenverchannel.com.
[00:39:55.485 --> 00:40:02.468]  And they've been talking about how these so-called exercises are going to be going on for most of the week.
[00:40:02.468 --> 00:40:08.311]  And when people call in to find out what the heck is going on, they're being told it's none of your business.
[00:40:08.311 --> 00:40:11.512]  And this is the same thing that happened in Houston about 15 years ago.
[00:40:12.096 --> 00:40:34.892]  When they were holding live fire exercises in Houston, there at the Houston Ship Channel, and Channel 2 of Houston, KPRC-TV, went down there to cover it, and you saw all the bullet holes and pockmarks in the buildings, and when the police chief at the time, Police Chief Sam Nucci, was asked what's going on here, his comment was, the public doesn't have the right to know.
[00:40:34.892 --> 00:40:39.695]  Now, in a related incident on Channel 2 News out of Denver last night,
[00:40:40.242 --> 00:40:53.446]  Some egghead left-wing professor from Boulder, Colorado has issued a report stating that people who drive with bumper stickers on their car are more prone to aggression.
[00:40:53.446 --> 00:41:04.630]  So, in other words, if you stand up to speak your peace, to exercise your God-given First Amendment rights, then you are prone to aggression, so someone has to keep a sharp eye on you.
[00:41:06.246 --> 00:41:12.277]  Yeah, well I mean right now in Denver there's live fire exercises going on.
[00:41:12.277 --> 00:41:14.000]  They're using live ammunition.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.443]  They've set up detention centers.
[00:41:15.976 --> 00:41:16.476]  Okay.
[00:41:16.476 --> 00:41:18.298]  They're working with the local police.
[00:41:18.298 --> 00:41:20.499]  It's ex-military and current military.
[00:41:20.499 --> 00:41:22.020]  They're using black helicopters.
[00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:23.301]  They're really setting these things up.
[00:41:23.301 --> 00:41:26.924]  They've been doing these urban warfare drills since the 90s.
[00:41:26.924 --> 00:41:29.246]  It's in Alex's films and the police state movies.
[00:41:29.246 --> 00:41:30.987]  It's even a bit of a tyranny a little bit.
[00:41:30.987 --> 00:41:32.828]  I mean, they're really doing this.
[00:41:32.828 --> 00:41:39.173]  And some of these federal Gestapo agents that are participating in the drill are from right here in Cheyenne.
[00:41:39.173 --> 00:41:41.095]  So it's not just locals doing it.
[00:41:41.095 --> 00:41:44.257]  The feds are coming in from Cheyenne and they've got these special
[00:41:45.101 --> 00:42:12.133]  Uh, trucks down there that who knows what the heck they're for, but they're doing this to condition people to the fact, and I called in on a local talk show to try to wake people up this morning, that what they're doing is a little mind conditioning, and they want us to believe that there's an Arab hiding behind every bush with an AK-47, and we're supposed to fear them, but I said the only terrorists we have to fear about basically are from Langley, Virginia.
[00:42:15.663 --> 00:42:18.564]  I think that there's a lot going on.
[00:42:18.564 --> 00:42:20.585]  I mean, I think it's more than just Langley, Virginia.
[00:42:20.585 --> 00:42:24.227]  Although Langley, obviously an intelligence hub, but there's intelligence hubs throughout the country.
[00:42:24.227 --> 00:42:27.689]  I mean, you look what was over in the World Trade Center prior to the attacks.
[00:42:27.689 --> 00:42:31.571]  I mean, World Trade Center 7 housed the largest CIA office outside of Langley.
[00:42:31.571 --> 00:42:35.112]  It had the largest Secret Service office in the world, a large FBI base.
[00:42:35.112 --> 00:42:37.614]  I mean, you know, total spook houses throughout the country.
[00:42:37.614 --> 00:42:39.335]  Obviously, Virginia is a central hub.
[00:42:39.335 --> 00:42:40.275]  I thank you for the call.
[00:42:40.275 --> 00:42:42.696]  Let's go to Dan in Kentucky.
[00:42:42.696 --> 00:42:44.117]  Dan, are you with us?
[00:42:44.117 --> 00:42:44.297]  Hello.
[00:42:44.932 --> 00:42:45.412]  Hey, how you doing?
[00:42:45.412 --> 00:42:46.793]  What's on your mind, man?
[00:42:46.793 --> 00:42:48.273]  Hey, man.
[00:42:48.273 --> 00:43:01.339]  When Alex was up in Bilderberg, you made a comment about Current.com, and coincidentally at the time I was dealing with them on a censorship issue, and your comment was like, you know, how they let stuff go by for the truth movement.
[00:43:01.339 --> 00:43:13.424]  Oddly enough, right now on their site, they've actually let the Mike Revell story for the independent 9-1-1 investigation for the 9-11 ballot initiative
[00:43:14.042 --> 00:43:25.724]  That's actually going to be hitting their news here in a few moments, but I just wanted to tell the community that, uh, you know, it's a good idea if they want to help the fight for truth to get over to current.com and start voicing their opinions.
[00:43:25.724 --> 00:43:27.305]  Um, you know, but be kind.
[00:43:27.305 --> 00:43:28.445]  It's not big.com.
[00:43:28.445 --> 00:43:32.466]  It's not a place that you want to, you know, you want to treat the audience there with respect.
[00:43:32.466 --> 00:43:35.726]  They're intellectuals and you know, they, they, they, they like facts.
[00:43:35.726 --> 00:43:36.686]  They like hard facts.
[00:43:36.686 --> 00:43:39.607]  So that was just one of my thoughts on the, on the subject.
[00:43:40.529 --> 00:43:42.250]  Yeah, absolutely, man.
[00:43:42.250 --> 00:43:42.790]  I thank you for the call.
[00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:45.231]  Let's go to Evangeline in Virginia.
[00:43:45.231 --> 00:43:46.752]  Evangeline, are you there?
[00:43:46.752 --> 00:43:47.292]  Yeah, I'm here.
[00:43:47.292 --> 00:43:48.213]  Hi.
[00:43:48.213 --> 00:43:58.378]  I just wanted to call and, first of all, thank you very much for all the effort that you have put in, and Alex also, in exposing the reality of what's happening.
[00:43:59.445 --> 00:44:13.836]  I'm prior military and I think it was like 2003 is when I first saw loose change and I was at the time thinking because things weren't making sense and it was a really great catalyst for putting me on the path.
[00:44:13.836 --> 00:44:16.037]  Finding what was really going on.
[00:44:16.037 --> 00:44:18.479]  So I'm not listening to your show.
[00:44:18.479 --> 00:44:22.742]  I saw that you guys were going to be talking about weather today.
[00:44:22.742 --> 00:44:24.383]  Yes.
[00:44:24.383 --> 00:44:26.005]  But I don't really have anything to say about that.
[00:44:26.005 --> 00:44:26.945]  I just wanted to say that
[00:44:30.643 --> 00:44:49.709]  In light of Dennis Kucinich's recent heroic thing that he's been doing with the 35 articles for impeachment, if anybody doesn't know, if any of the Alex Jones listeners are ever appointed to a grand jury position, there's a lot of... Have you guys ever talked about that?
[00:44:49.709 --> 00:44:51.490]  Are you aware of...
[00:44:53.091 --> 00:44:59.115]  Yeah, you know, I just think that, you know, Alex has talked about this before, but it seems like a dead end.
[00:44:59.115 --> 00:45:04.598]  I mean, I may be wrong, but I've heard of the Citizen's Grand Jury many times.
[00:45:04.598 --> 00:45:11.522]  I've sat down with conferences with other leaders in the 9-11 truth movement, and I just don't see the light at the end of the tunnel.
[00:45:11.522 --> 00:45:14.263]  I just don't see how this is actually going to work.
[00:45:14.263 --> 00:45:14.943]  I could be wrong.
[00:45:14.943 --> 00:45:15.884]  I mean, I'm not perfect.
[00:45:16.451 --> 00:45:21.753]  Right, and neither am I, definitely, and you guys are definitely, you know, you've made tons of headway.
[00:45:21.753 --> 00:45:34.159]  I mean, if I can call my mom, who's like a fundamental Baptist in Maine, and she is, you know, a die-hard Bush and Reagan fan, and she's been exposed to it, then, I mean, you guys are definitely leading the, you know, I mean, there's no question about it.
[00:45:34.159 --> 00:45:42.183]  But, I did happen to see, there's a really great Google video called LA Law Man.
[00:45:42.882 --> 00:45:45.903]  And, um, it details, like, it's good.
[00:45:45.903 --> 00:45:49.125]  Like, and so if anybody wants to just look it up, Google it, LA Law Man.
[00:45:49.125 --> 00:45:50.906]  It talks about the grand jury and how it would work.
[00:45:50.906 --> 00:45:54.947]  And I definitely don't think it's where we need to put all your attention or energy.
[00:45:54.947 --> 00:46:02.611]  But if you're, if you're called, you know, you should be aware of what your rights and what the potential is for you to make a difference in that situation.
[00:46:02.611 --> 00:46:06.332]  So if you're educating yourself about what's going on, just like take three seconds.
[00:46:06.332 --> 00:46:12.275]  And, you know, if you get a letter in the mail that, that, you know, request your, uh, you know, you stand on a grand jury.
[00:46:14.481 --> 00:46:16.361]  Well, I'll definitely have people look at it.
[00:46:16.361 --> 00:46:17.702]  Thanks for the call, Evangeline.
[00:46:17.702 --> 00:46:19.803]  You know, I've talked with people about this grand jury.
[00:46:19.803 --> 00:46:22.964]  People think that we're like covering it up or whatever.
[00:46:22.964 --> 00:46:26.265]  I just don't know if it has any teeth.
[00:46:26.265 --> 00:46:29.206]  You know, I just I really don't think it does have any teeth.
[00:46:29.206 --> 00:46:29.907]  I may be wrong.
[00:46:29.907 --> 00:46:31.747]  You know, I'm all for these different initiatives.
[00:46:31.747 --> 00:46:37.369]  You know, I'm all for getting the architects and engineers to get a thousand signatures by September 11th this year.
[00:46:37.369 --> 00:46:41.231]  I'm all for the New York City about ballot initiative with which now only has
[00:46:42.005 --> 00:46:45.547]  I think a week to get something like 40,000 signatures.
[00:46:45.547 --> 00:46:49.409]  Please, if you're in New York and you can sign up for that, please do it.
[00:46:49.409 --> 00:46:49.809]  We'll see.
[00:46:49.809 --> 00:46:51.210]  Let's go to more calls.
[00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:52.451]  Let's go to Tony in Illinois.
[00:46:52.451 --> 00:46:53.011]  Tony, are you there?
[00:46:53.011 --> 00:46:55.832]  Tony, are you with us?
[00:46:55.832 --> 00:46:57.013]  Yeah, yeah, Jason.
[00:46:57.013 --> 00:46:57.613]  Okay.
[00:46:57.613 --> 00:46:59.134]  I have a frank question for you.
[00:46:59.134 --> 00:46:59.594]  Sure.
[00:46:59.594 --> 00:47:09.120]  In all your, you know, good work that you've done over the years on 9-1-1, why haven't you brought out the point that 9-1-1, okay, the planning for it,
[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:23.044]  Well, I mean, I do try to point out that the Sudanese, I mean, it's not in our films, but when I go around and give a talk, I try to point out that this is not just the Bush administration.
[00:47:23.044 --> 00:47:27.146]  I do try to point out that the Sudanese did offer bin Laden up.
[00:47:27.146 --> 00:47:33.850]  Instead of taking bin Laden, we bombed Sudan and we ended up, we said it was a target that was bin Laden's, you know, hideout.
[00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:38.552]  It turned out to be one of their big medical centers where they produced most of their aspirin.
[00:47:39.013 --> 00:47:41.395]  So, I mean, I do bring up that portion about it.
[00:47:41.395 --> 00:47:43.356]  Is there something else I'm missing?
[00:47:43.356 --> 00:47:45.717]  Well, let me just ask you this.
[00:47:45.717 --> 00:47:47.859]  You know of David Hawkins?
[00:47:47.859 --> 00:47:48.619]  Uh, no.
[00:47:48.619 --> 00:47:49.360]  You don't know?
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:51.401]  You've never heard the guy, David Hawkins?
[00:47:51.401 --> 00:47:54.643]  Maybe in passing, but I couldn't tell you anything about him off the top of my head.
[00:47:54.643 --> 00:47:57.065]  At HawksCafe.com?
[00:47:57.065 --> 00:47:57.605]  Okay.
[00:47:57.605 --> 00:47:59.026]  HawksCafe.com?
[00:47:59.026 --> 00:47:59.506]  Uh-huh.
[00:47:59.506 --> 00:48:00.927]  You've never been to that site?
[00:48:00.927 --> 00:48:01.328]  No.
[00:48:01.328 --> 00:48:02.348]  I'm not being derogatory.
[00:48:02.348 --> 00:48:03.949]  No, no, I've never been there.
[00:48:03.949 --> 00:48:05.731]  Please, tell me who he is, because I don't know.
[00:48:05.731 --> 00:48:06.411]  He has videos.
[00:48:08.601 --> 00:48:12.184]  He's an ex-Air Force officer, and he has this thing mailed.
[00:48:12.184 --> 00:48:13.985]  You came close.
[00:48:13.985 --> 00:48:15.226]  You came very close.
[00:48:15.226 --> 00:48:18.248]  He has this thing mailed down.
[00:48:18.248 --> 00:48:20.449]  Well, it's hawkscafe.com?
[00:48:20.449 --> 00:48:21.590]  Yeah, hawkscafe.com.
[00:48:21.590 --> 00:48:23.632]  He has part of your video on there.
[00:48:23.632 --> 00:48:26.714]  I was surprised you weren't, you know, working with him.
[00:48:26.714 --> 00:48:27.674]  In touch with him?
[00:48:27.674 --> 00:48:29.236]  No, a lot of people post my video, man.
[00:48:29.236 --> 00:48:31.257]  I mean, we make it available to everybody it's on.
[00:48:31.872 --> 00:48:33.692]  Thousands of sites across the world.
[00:48:33.692 --> 00:48:35.193]  So I'll go check it out.
[00:48:35.193 --> 00:48:38.333]  You know, I'm not trying to be a gatekeeper or hide any information.
[00:48:38.333 --> 00:48:40.074]  I thank you for the call, Tony.
[00:48:40.074 --> 00:48:42.414]  Let's jump to Jim in New York.
[00:48:42.414 --> 00:48:43.834]  Jim, are you with us?
[00:48:43.834 --> 00:48:44.054]  Yes.
[00:48:44.054 --> 00:48:45.575]  Hi, Jason.
[00:48:45.575 --> 00:48:50.776]  What I wanted to ask you, you mentioned about Kandar and a couple of things.
[00:48:50.776 --> 00:48:52.796]  What documentation is there for that?
[00:48:52.796 --> 00:48:53.736]  Because you mentioned it.
[00:48:53.736 --> 00:48:56.217]  And when I when I present this to people,
[00:48:56.923 --> 00:48:59.345]  You know, I'm not sure you'd like to have some kind of document.
[00:48:59.345 --> 00:49:00.126]  Sure, sure, sure.
[00:49:00.126 --> 00:49:03.829]  Let me give you a couple, let me give you a couple links right now.
[00:49:03.829 --> 00:49:08.713]  If you go to the Guardian, okay, that's who reported on Friday that this attack took place.
[00:49:08.713 --> 00:49:10.554]  That's the UK Guardian.
[00:49:10.554 --> 00:49:14.898]  Just type in Guardian Afghan prison attack, okay?
[00:49:14.898 --> 00:49:23.925]  Now, Monday, they reported on CNN, it was on CNN.com, that there was a big insurgent of the Taliban.
[00:49:24.306 --> 00:49:34.530]  in in kandahar afghanistan and other places basically the taliban had took over and then the article that i'm looking at right now that came out in monday uh... on monday afternoon u.s.
[00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:44.654]  role in afghan prison attack if you type that into google in quotation marks the first thing that should come up is this press tv which is an international media source article where it says u.s.
[00:49:44.654 --> 00:49:48.615]  led forces have played a part in a taliban attack on and against
[00:49:49.048 --> 00:49:50.049]  I read a lot of this.
[00:49:50.049 --> 00:49:51.170]  I've been doing it for 30 years.
[00:49:51.170 --> 00:49:52.130]  But anyway, Oklahoma, right?
[00:50:17.290 --> 00:50:17.490]  Yeah.
[00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:20.552]  Where can you find documentation for that?
[00:50:20.552 --> 00:50:21.272]  Sure.
[00:50:21.272 --> 00:50:25.495]  I'm sure if you just Google it, you can get the actual resolution I read on air.
[00:50:25.495 --> 00:50:28.116]  It's House Joint Resolution 1089.
[00:50:28.116 --> 00:50:34.680]  So just type in House Joint Resolution 1089, or I believe the Hart article was set up.
[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:36.241]  Where is it from?
[00:50:36.241 --> 00:50:36.841]  I can't find it.
[00:50:36.841 --> 00:50:39.082]  I've got such a stack of news here.
[00:50:39.082 --> 00:50:40.383]  I'll come back with the Hart article.
[00:50:40.383 --> 00:50:41.484]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:50:41.484 --> 00:50:44.385]  I'm Jason Bermas, InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:50:54.426 --> 00:51:07.579]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.

[00:51:48.201 --> 00:51:56.083]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[00:51:56.083 --> 00:52:00.564]  Another untold story, here it comes.
[00:52:00.564 --> 00:52:05.085]  Another untold story, here it comes.
[00:52:05.085 --> 00:52:11.187]  Another untold story that you have not been told from AnotherUntoldStory.com
[00:52:14.926 --> 00:52:16.827]  Have you been conditioned?
[00:52:16.827 --> 00:52:23.231]  Many have heard the story of Pavel's dogs, the Russian scientists financed by the murderous red dictator Stalin.
[00:52:23.231 --> 00:52:29.975]  Pavel's experimentation with animals and humans popularized the expression, conditioned reflex.
[00:52:29.975 --> 00:52:38.740]  Edward Hunter, in his book, Brainwashing, reports how the scientists conditioned dogs to respond to such things as lights and sounds.
[00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:59.584]  David Noble in his book, The Marxist Minstrels, reports about your brain and Pavel's work saying that it, quote, can receive suggestions and impulses arousing emotions and even bodily actions without the master of the house, the executive organism, realizing his body temple has been invaded, end quote.
[00:53:00.552 --> 00:53:03.074]  Americans, we've been conditioned.
[00:53:03.074 --> 00:53:08.559]  But there is an untold story that has to do with Pavlov's dogs that most have never been told.
[00:53:08.559 --> 00:53:14.545]  A story that has to do with Pavlov's conditioned dogs and how they suddenly became unconditioned.
[00:53:14.545 --> 00:53:22.492]  And that story relates to the ongoing story of weather changes and catastrophes presently going on and increasing.
[00:53:23.132 --> 00:53:49.745]  It's all quite a story told nowhere else but at AnotherUntoldStory.com and it's only posted there but for a short time so go there AnotherUntoldStory.com For another untold story go to AnotherUntoldStory.com AnotherUntoldStory.com AnotherUntoldStory.com AnotherUntoldStory.com
[00:53:57.458 --> 00:54:08.761]  Day after day, alone on a hill, the man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still.
[00:54:08.761 --> 00:54:16.243]  But nobody wants to know him, they can see that he's just a fool.
[00:54:18.391 --> 00:54:30.799]  Well, folks, you just can't keep everybody happy.
[00:54:30.799 --> 00:54:32.960]  I can't tell you how much hate mail I've gotten.
[00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:36.442]  I'm the supposed patriot side.
[00:54:36.442 --> 00:54:37.543]  Giving out my Myspace.
[00:54:37.543 --> 00:54:41.225]  Myspace.com slash Jason Burmess if you want to get a hold of me.
[00:54:41.225 --> 00:54:45.167]  You know, I see where Alex gets frustrated because it's just never enough for some people.
[00:54:45.714 --> 00:54:53.659]  People complain that he doesn't promote this, and he doesn't promote that, and Jason, you don't promote this either, and you're a gatekeeper.
[00:54:53.659 --> 00:54:56.140]  I mean, come on, or I'm too passive.
[00:54:56.140 --> 00:54:59.002]  Someone's mad at me because I said things are going to take time.
[00:54:59.002 --> 00:55:00.403]  Well, they are going to take time.
[00:55:00.403 --> 00:55:02.184]  Nothing is overnight here.
[00:55:02.184 --> 00:55:07.267]  And for that last caller, if you're looking for the actual article, it's at WorldNetDaily.
[00:55:07.267 --> 00:55:13.871]  If you're not just looking for the resolution of Oklahoma trying to secede from the Union, using its state's rights,
[00:55:14.361 --> 00:55:19.303]  It's Oklahoma to Feds, don't tread on me, it's at a World Net Daily, your government at work.
[00:55:19.303 --> 00:55:29.968]  When Alex gets on, and hopefully he'll be on with me at the top of the hour, we're going to be talking about this article out of the New York Times, Bush will seek to end offshore drilling ban.
[00:55:29.968 --> 00:55:37.831]  Now I'm pretty sure that his father is the one that put that ban down, and now he just wants to go around and drill anywhere he can.
[00:55:37.831 --> 00:55:41.493]  We will get the Alex Jones perspective at the top of the hour.
[00:55:42.119 --> 00:55:43.360]  All right, let's keep taking calls.
[00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:45.101]  Let's go to Coyote in Colorado.
[00:55:45.101 --> 00:55:47.342]  Coyote, are you there?
[00:55:47.342 --> 00:55:48.202]  Hey, Jason.
[00:55:48.202 --> 00:55:49.263]  Hey, how you doing, man?
[00:55:49.263 --> 00:55:51.264]  You're doing a masterful job, my friend.
[00:55:51.264 --> 00:55:52.604]  Well, thank you, sir.
[00:55:52.604 --> 00:55:59.568]  You know, I want to reiterate that Oklahoma is not seceding from the Union.
[00:55:59.568 --> 00:56:00.268]  Okay.
[00:56:00.268 --> 00:56:09.613]  Oklahoma is only declaring sovereignty under the 10th Amendment, which, you know, the 10th Amendment is a part of the Constitution.
[00:56:10.103 --> 00:56:12.624]  So they're staying within the law.
[00:56:12.624 --> 00:56:23.251]  But this whole thing started back in 1994, and it's been under the wire for, well, it was on its way up until Oklahoma City.
[00:56:23.251 --> 00:56:24.791]  That's how they obfuscated it.
[00:56:24.791 --> 00:56:32.056]  That's how they got it stopped, because it was grassroots organizations, militia groups,
[00:56:33.248 --> 00:56:34.669]  Constitutional organizations.
[00:56:34.669 --> 00:56:37.550]  So you're saying there was a push for this almost 15 years ago?
[00:56:37.550 --> 00:56:38.070]  Oh yeah.
[00:56:38.070 --> 00:56:39.111]  Okay.
[00:56:39.111 --> 00:56:42.032]  I was directly involved in it, as a matter of fact.
[00:56:42.032 --> 00:56:43.553]  Colorado was the very first one.
[00:56:43.553 --> 00:56:54.658]  If people want to know more about this, and so there'll be less conjecture, you know, the poor fellow earlier who said he just learned about this two days ago.
[00:56:54.658 --> 00:56:59.721]  Well, he's under the misconception that the federal government can come in with military force.
[00:56:59.721 --> 00:57:00.281]  They cannot.
[00:57:00.859 --> 00:57:07.462]  If they do, that would prove the unlawful and rogue nature of the federal government.
[00:57:07.462 --> 00:57:10.344]  Well, I think we've kind of seen that in some places already.
[00:57:10.344 --> 00:57:23.811]  If you look to California, you know, they have all these laws passed for medical marijuana, and they have all these shops where people have cards and they go in, yet the federal government still oversteps their bounds and raids those places, treating them like common drug dealers.
[00:57:23.811 --> 00:57:26.772]  So, I don't think it's quite out of the realm of possibility.
[00:57:26.772 --> 00:57:30.534]  Well, again, you know, there is a federal law against, you know,
[00:57:31.098 --> 00:57:39.924]  certain drugs which that federal law it can be argued and if it was done properly and went to the Supreme Court it would be overturned.
[00:57:39.924 --> 00:57:41.445]  Ron Paul's all for that.
[00:57:41.445 --> 00:57:41.645]  Yeah.
[00:57:41.645 --> 00:58:00.779]  And so am I. The thing is if people want to know more about what Oklahoma's doing go over to PrisonPlanet.com click on the forum and go in to General or into the 11 to 2 live radio broadcast and there's a post in there

[01:00:12.126 --> 01:00:13.606]  All right, folks, we are back.
[01:00:13.606 --> 01:00:14.807]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:14.807 --> 01:00:15.887]  I'm Jason Bermas.
[01:00:15.887 --> 01:00:22.009]  And joining us right now is Alex Jones to give us his take on all this late-breaking news.
[01:00:22.009 --> 01:00:22.849]  Alex, how are you, sir?
[01:00:24.392 --> 01:00:26.333]  Jason, I appreciate you sitting in for me.
[01:00:26.333 --> 01:00:50.086]  I take off a few times a year and take my children down to the Texas beach to build sand castles, and part of this week is just such a thing, but I've been chomping at the bit, seeing all the news and watching President Bush's little speech this morning about energy that I wanted to comment about that, and then listening to you earlier today on the show talking about the Oklahoma Resolution, which I was aware they'd introduced a few months ago.
[01:00:50.086 --> 01:00:53.628]  I wasn't aware that they'd passed, and then also I heard you talking about how
[01:00:54.190 --> 01:00:59.114]  And I actually read this morning myself, they're now saying the Governor's Mansion is politically motivated.
[01:00:59.114 --> 01:01:01.936]  That means they're going to say it is terrorism.
[01:01:01.936 --> 01:01:09.923]  And so, coming up after the break, I want to comment on Bush's three-part energy plan for just one segment.
[01:01:09.923 --> 01:01:14.486]  But in this segment, I might as well go ahead and comment first off on the Governor's Mansion.
[01:01:14.486 --> 01:01:20.271]  For those around the country, we've written key articles at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, because we're in Austin.
[01:01:20.271 --> 01:01:21.091]  There is a huge
[01:01:22.577 --> 01:01:25.638]  Construction fence that's ten feet tall around it.
[01:01:25.638 --> 01:01:33.560]  Then there is an eight to ten foot, depending on which area, around the governor's mansion, wrought iron fence with spiked stars on the top of it.
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:48.685]  There were motion sensors all around the property, and thirty-five plus cameras on top of that, plus the sheriff's department across the street, plus the wheelhouse, as they call it, a garrisoned building of state police, which they admit state police are in.
[01:01:48.685 --> 01:01:49.865]  The state police lied
[01:01:51.276 --> 01:01:55.979]  About, uh, calling in 9-1-1 themselves when they hadn't, calling the fire department.
[01:01:55.979 --> 01:01:57.360]  Turned out they just didn't call.
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:58.701]  Took 18 minutes.
[01:01:58.701 --> 01:02:01.423]  We interviewed the guy, we went down there, who did.
[01:02:01.423 --> 01:02:03.424]  Alfonso, who did make the call.
[01:02:03.424 --> 01:02:06.666]  Uh, and so the whole thing is very, very suspicious.
[01:02:06.666 --> 01:02:18.074]  How did somebody climb over two fences, set a fire, and get out undetected, when normally I've been out there at night videotaping it for films or bullhorning, and they come up and confront us.
[01:02:19.065 --> 01:02:23.088]  Uh, so that when we say inside job, it means the government did it.
[01:02:23.088 --> 01:02:25.810]  The state or federal government, the BATF's investigating it.
[01:02:25.810 --> 01:02:28.072]  They're the folks that covered up Oklahoma City.
[01:02:28.072 --> 01:02:30.774]  They're the people that covered up Waco.
[01:02:30.774 --> 01:02:34.197]  Uh, with Oklahoma City, it looks like they're the ones that planted the bombs.
[01:02:34.197 --> 01:02:42.223]  Uh, they're the ones that covered up 9-11 both times, when they, when the feds cut the bomb and trained the driver in 93, with the World Trade Center.
[01:02:42.223 --> 01:02:45.246]  So, they are the consummate cover-up artists, and I've been down there.
[01:02:46.511 --> 01:02:47.992]  Videotaping the BATF.
[01:02:47.992 --> 01:02:56.357]  You were down there with me, Jason, and there was all this media, but they pointed us out and stopped having a meeting they were having outside the gates and ran back in pointing at our cameras.
[01:02:56.357 --> 01:03:02.902]  They seemed to recognize us out of a sea of 10 or 15 other, there was a whole bunch of other news trucks and news agencies.
[01:03:02.902 --> 01:03:05.303]  You couldn't tell how many because they were swarming around.
[01:03:05.303 --> 01:03:08.005]  But the point is, it was at least 20 reporters out there.
[01:03:08.005 --> 01:03:11.327]  I would guess from probably 10, 15 different agencies, different news groups.
[01:03:12.239 --> 01:03:19.846]  But they pointed us out and noticed we were videotaping them from 50 yards away, pointed right at me, and then went back inside to have their discussion.
[01:03:19.846 --> 01:03:22.508]  So, it's an inside job.
[01:03:22.508 --> 01:03:31.737]  I mean, either it's an employee or somebody with access, a contractor, who acted alone for political reasons, 99% chance, or it's the government.
[01:03:32.336 --> 01:03:43.184]  And we don't know, but we said that if they came out and claimed some lone patriot did it, and now they've got to crack down on, you know, anti-NAFTA superhighway people or anti-toll road people.
[01:03:43.184 --> 01:03:45.286]  Oh my God, you've got to be for the toll roads now.
[01:03:45.286 --> 01:03:50.890]  You've got to be for the tens of billions of dollars sucked out of Texans, and the NAFTA superhighway, or you're for firebombing.
[01:03:50.890 --> 01:03:53.272]  So, we predicted a few weeks ago
[01:03:53.982 --> 01:04:01.086]  When it happened, day one, they would go ahead and say this, and they'll have some mental patient that they'll produce.
[01:04:01.086 --> 01:04:04.488]  If it's a Patsy, they've always got a mental background.
[01:04:04.488 --> 01:04:07.810]  They'll have a bunch of people in their family that work for the state.
[01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:12.693]  Or they will try to frame somebody and burn their house down and kill them inside.
[01:04:12.693 --> 01:04:17.676]  Or they'll just kind of leave it hanging out there saying they believe it's a militia group or something.
[01:04:17.676 --> 01:04:19.076]  But that's the bottom line there.
[01:04:19.076 --> 01:04:19.877]  Burmess, what do you think?
[01:04:20.586 --> 01:04:21.066]  Absolutely.
[01:04:21.066 --> 01:04:25.869]  I think that they're going to try to say it was white Al-Qaeda, Alex, or say it was some kind of patriot group.
[01:04:25.869 --> 01:04:27.950]  I feel like they'd want to set you up.
[01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:29.791]  I mean, it's terrible.
[01:04:29.791 --> 01:04:32.712]  They're saying it was somebody who was politically motivated.
[01:04:32.712 --> 01:04:34.753]  They're saying it could be a terrorist.
[01:04:34.753 --> 01:04:39.895]  You know, God knows what they're actually going to put out in their final report, but they say they have a tape of the guy too, but they're not putting it out.
[01:04:39.895 --> 01:04:41.816]  It's InfoWars.com, PrisonPlan.com.
[01:04:41.816 --> 01:04:42.757]  Be back after this.
[01:04:51.536 --> 01:04:52.957]  It is a big idea.
[01:04:52.957 --> 01:04:55.758]  A New World Order.
[01:04:55.758 --> 01:05:00.661]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:05:00.661 --> 01:05:03.503]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:05:03.503 --> 01:05:06.284]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:05:06.284 --> 01:05:09.466]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:05:09.466 --> 01:05:16.790]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:05:19.807 --> 01:05:25.271]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:05:25.271 --> 01:05:29.173]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.

[01:05:52.768 --> 01:05:54.028]  Let's get real.
[01:05:54.028 --> 01:05:55.749]  Flour is already being rationed.
[01:05:55.749 --> 01:06:00.951]  Prices on food are getting so high warehouses are installing security systems and guards.
[01:06:00.951 --> 01:06:04.852]  You can expect soon to see criminal activity in food.
[01:06:04.852 --> 01:06:12.815]  We're all in a foot race as to whether the food will become so expensive we can't afford it or there will be no food at any price.
[01:06:12.815 --> 01:06:15.316]  We can't grow enough of our own food even with genetically
[01:06:17.551 --> 01:06:18.011]  We're good to go!

[01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:54.625]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:07:54.625 --> 01:07:59.174]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:59.174 --> 01:08:01.699]  Alright folks, we are back at the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:01.699 --> 01:08:03.963]  Alex Jones is on the line.
[01:08:04.702 --> 01:08:08.725]  And Alex, this is another thing that I talked about yesterday, and we have a man on the ground.
[01:08:08.725 --> 01:08:14.770]  They're doing urban warfare drills right now in Denver, Colorado, in preparation for the DNC.
[01:08:14.770 --> 01:08:26.799]  Literally separate types of black helicopters, military, former military, all working with the police, and Jonathan from We Are Change Colorado apparently got like eight hours of footage and he's going to be sending it out to us.
[01:08:26.799 --> 01:08:32.784]  But they're literally training to put us in detention centers for the DNC, Alex.
[01:08:32.784 --> 01:08:33.725]  Well, listen.
[01:08:34.346 --> 01:08:42.328]  It's not my opinion that we have the declassified government documents, PDD-25, PDD-51, going back decades.
[01:08:42.328 --> 01:08:44.509]  I've been to urban warfare training drills.
[01:08:44.509 --> 01:08:50.551]  The military admits they're training to take our guns, break our families up, and put us in forced labor camps.
[01:08:50.551 --> 01:09:03.375]  I have all the mainstream news articles where at federal prisons they already make you work, they force you to, or they do pain compliance and strap you in torture chairs for days, the equivalent of hanging you from the dungeon
[01:09:03.959 --> 01:09:04.179]  I don't
[01:09:24.051 --> 01:09:27.673]  Now they're training the military, the police, the drills get bigger and bigger.
[01:09:27.673 --> 01:09:41.402]  They just had a military martial law takeover drill with live checkpoints all over Indianapolis, Indiana and surrounding areas with 2,000 plus Marines and over 1,000 handlers with them.
[01:09:41.402 --> 01:09:44.204]  They're having the martial law drills, of course, in Denver.
[01:09:44.204 --> 01:09:52.269]  They've done two top-off drills there in the last five years, putting people in the sports stadiums, rounding them up, sound cannons, microwave guns.
[01:09:53.470 --> 01:10:06.120]  Meanwhile, six months before the Oklahoma City bombing, where the feds carried out the attacks, now completely come out that the Southern Poverty Law Center was running the white supremacist compound.
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:10.723]  Andres Socrates Meyer was CIA commanding the facility.
[01:10:10.723 --> 01:10:23.173]  McVeigh had been, quote, sheep-dipped out of special forces, told people, told Larry Nichols and others and sworn affidavits, you know, that he was part of a secret government program, that they were going to bomb the building basically to get more security.
[01:10:23.914 --> 01:10:27.216]  And of course, then he was set up and drugged until he was executed.
[01:10:27.216 --> 01:10:38.561]  Just as we knew, he had the most famous mind-control doctor, Jolion West, in the MKUltra hearings in 77, was his doctor until the day he died a few years ago in Terre Haute, Indiana.
[01:10:38.561 --> 01:10:43.724]  And then, of course, he was... Mr. West died finally last year, Jolion West.
[01:10:43.724 --> 01:10:44.604]  Folks, this is real.
[01:10:44.604 --> 01:10:46.065]  Everything I just said is admitted.
[01:10:46.065 --> 01:10:50.407]  Do you understand it's admitted that Israel attacked the U.S.'
[01:10:50.367 --> 01:10:51.948]  's liberty to blame it on Egypt?
[01:10:51.948 --> 01:10:53.469]  Now NSA declassified.
[01:10:54.235 --> 01:10:56.917]  The Israeli pilots told the truth five years ago.
[01:10:56.917 --> 01:11:01.381]  It's declassified that the Gulf of Tonkin was staged.
[01:11:01.381 --> 01:11:04.083]  All these things we brought out are now admitted.
[01:11:04.083 --> 01:11:04.784]  The U.S.
[01:11:04.784 --> 01:11:07.406]  is going into tyranny receivership.
[01:11:07.406 --> 01:11:12.310]  Now, I really wanted to get into Oklahoma passing this resolution.
[01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:18.475]  Ladies and gentlemen, Arizona almost passed one six years ago because of Senator Karen Johnson.
[01:11:18.475 --> 01:11:22.659]  She saw my film, Police State 2000, and went and got it and tried to get it passed.
[01:11:24.039 --> 01:11:35.244]  Oklahoma did pass a resolution against the UN, against gun control, against the North American Union in late 2004.
[01:11:35.244 --> 01:11:39.746]  And it said that if Clinton continued what he was doing, they were going to pull out of the union.
[01:11:39.746 --> 01:11:45.968]  And so the feds bombed them six months later on April 19th, 1995.
[01:11:45.968 --> 01:11:47.769]  Oklahoma has done the right thing again.
[01:11:48.690 --> 01:11:53.353]  And I would look for the feds to go ahead and savagely bomb them, or bomb somewhere nearby.
[01:11:53.353 --> 01:11:55.294]  This is how they operate.
[01:11:55.294 --> 01:12:03.298]  You know, to teach them to love the abusers, to teach them to love the masters, to learn how to love the tyrants.
[01:12:03.298 --> 01:12:08.141]  And so it's very, very exciting that that resolution has passed.
[01:12:08.141 --> 01:12:16.105]  Also, the week before 9-11, I had members of the legislature of New Hampshire and heads of some of their largest cities on
[01:12:16.972 --> 01:12:37.653]  They were instituting Article 10, Clause 10, Right to Revolt, because their state constitution was set up right when the Declaration of Independence and Bill of Rights, well Declaration of Independence was in 1776, but right when that was codified into the Bill of Rights many years later.
[01:12:38.763 --> 01:12:41.924]  And so, they have the, quote, right to revolt.
[01:12:41.924 --> 01:12:54.829]  We all have that, but it's stated it's their right to viciously, savagely, militarily attack the government if it tries to take any of their basic liberties, and that the state government and the city governments have the right to vote and pull out.
[01:12:54.829 --> 01:12:59.071]  They were scheduled to vote September 13th.
[01:12:59.071 --> 01:13:01.712]  But I'm not saying that's why the bombings took place, the attacks of 9-11.
[01:13:03.279 --> 01:13:04.320]  Uh, 2001.
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:06.061]  The point is, that was happening there.
[01:13:06.061 --> 01:13:07.903]  Arizona's close to doing it.
[01:13:07.903 --> 01:13:09.664]  Other states are close to doing it.
[01:13:09.664 --> 01:13:13.207]  Look, the government... New polls are out.
[01:13:13.207 --> 01:13:17.049]  82% are against the war from 75% two years ago.
[01:13:17.049 --> 01:13:22.133]  99% in major polls are against the NAFTA superhighway expansion.
[01:13:22.133 --> 01:13:24.835]  Uh, we've got 70-plus percent of the troops against it.
[01:13:24.835 --> 01:13:26.616]  91% against open borders.
[01:13:26.616 --> 01:13:31.760]  Everybody is against what's happening, but we're all isolated, balkanized, broken up.
[01:13:32.293 --> 01:13:40.701]  We have to come together now and get really serious, really motivated to wake up our fellow Americans that don't know what's happening.
[01:13:40.701 --> 01:13:43.683]  But Canada's going into receivership.
[01:13:43.683 --> 01:13:45.645]  Australia is going into receivership.
[01:13:45.645 --> 01:13:47.547]  Europe is going into receivership.
[01:13:47.547 --> 01:13:52.351]  Just last week, they shot down the European Union, gobbling up Ireland.
[01:13:52.351 --> 01:13:54.753]  And what did Barroso say the day after, Friday?
[01:13:54.753 --> 01:13:57.396]  He said, we're going to go ahead and go forward with it.
[01:13:57.396 --> 01:13:58.617]  See, they're criminals.
[01:13:59.736 --> 01:14:01.116]  It doesn't matter.
[01:14:01.116 --> 01:14:02.397]  They do what they want.
[01:14:02.397 --> 01:14:07.438]  That's why they're setting up death squads, militarizing the police, brainwashing them.
[01:14:07.438 --> 01:14:13.499]  The only group they've got on their side, partially, is the police, because they're used to shoving the slaves around.
[01:14:13.499 --> 01:14:18.420]  They've been trained it's for their own good, that they're protecting society instead of helping destroy it.
[01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:20.040]  All of this is a trap.
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:22.801]  It's like an anglerfish has a little, uh,
[01:14:23.772 --> 01:14:28.215]  Fishing lure on the front of his nose that he can move around and has a little glowing light on the end.
[01:14:28.215 --> 01:14:29.655]  They throw the drugs out.
[01:14:29.655 --> 01:14:30.796]  It's an angler fish.
[01:14:30.796 --> 01:14:31.296]  We bite.
[01:14:31.296 --> 01:14:33.978]  They suck us into their private prisons.
[01:14:33.978 --> 01:14:35.399]  They are an angler fish.
[01:14:35.399 --> 01:14:36.879]  They throw terrorism out there.
[01:14:36.879 --> 01:14:37.960]  We bite on it.
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:38.861]  They take our liberties.
[01:14:38.861 --> 01:14:40.922]  They gobble us up.
[01:14:40.922 --> 01:14:43.883]  They engineer the energy crisis.
[01:14:43.883 --> 01:14:48.726]  And perhaps now, for the next six, seven minutes, I should get into that, and then I'm going to let you get back to what you were doing, Barmus.
[01:14:48.726 --> 01:14:48.966]  All right.
[01:14:48.966 --> 01:14:49.407]  Sounds good.
[01:14:50.638 --> 01:14:56.300]  Headline at the New York Times is Bush will seek to end offshore drilling, oil drilling ban.
[01:14:56.300 --> 01:15:01.962]  Okay, well I'm here at the little Texas beach looking out at oil rigs everywhere.
[01:15:01.962 --> 01:15:04.942]  I'm looking at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 36 that I can just see on the horizon
[01:15:20.876 --> 01:15:23.718]  I can see what 10 of them are actually drilling right now.
[01:15:23.718 --> 01:15:30.662]  The rest are capped or wells connected, natural gas wells or oil pipeline wells that have already been drilled.
[01:15:30.662 --> 01:15:36.426]  This is one of the sectors in front of Port Aransas, Texas, where they, quote, allow it.
[01:15:36.426 --> 01:15:40.148]  Now, let me just take Bush's plan.
[01:15:40.148 --> 01:15:42.590]  Perhaps Prison Planet or Infowars can do a story on this.
[01:15:42.590 --> 01:15:47.453]  Let me just state what Bush said he's going to do, and then Burmess, go through what he's really going to do.
[01:15:47.453 --> 01:15:49.074]  It may take one more segment, okay?
[01:15:49.074 --> 01:15:49.434]  You got it.
[01:15:50.427 --> 01:15:52.167]  Okay.
[01:15:52.167 --> 01:16:05.470]  Again, I was just going to try to take out four or five days of the family, but I'm sitting there watching Bush's live press conference about three hours ago, and I called up Jason and I said, I need to come on my own show because we need to break down what's happening here.
[01:16:05.470 --> 01:16:08.151]  Now, this is the facts to the public.
[01:16:08.151 --> 01:16:13.852]  Now, remember, listeners, you know the facts, but your neighbors, your friends, your family don't.
[01:16:13.852 --> 01:16:16.693]  Bush gave fake reasons for the crisis.
[01:16:16.693 --> 01:16:18.693]  I watched Barack Obama and Al Gore.
[01:16:20.285 --> 01:16:20.826]  I don't think so.
[01:16:34.164 --> 01:17:01.327]  Because of Lindsey Williams and the oil company executives, the petroleum geologist, and the oil company documents, and the lawsuits that have happened, and the documents we've gotten, the fact that we've written scores of articles about this subject, and we at InfoWars.com and PrisonPilot.com on this radio show, we have talked to all the experts, plus my whole family, almost all my family works in oil, as petroleum geologists, as plant managers, as plant heads, as roughnecks,
[01:17:02.274 --> 01:17:07.796]  Uh, I've even got some family that, you know, got some little oil patches, uh, in their, uh, you know, property.
[01:17:07.796 --> 01:17:11.637]  So, at every level of it, I have an understanding of it.
[01:17:11.637 --> 01:17:15.618]  So, what I'm telling you is the absolute, verifiable fact.
[01:17:15.618 --> 01:17:17.199]  Okay, let's walk through it.
[01:17:17.199 --> 01:17:18.499]  And, Jason, jump anytime you want.
[01:17:18.499 --> 01:17:20.040]  How's my cell phone here?
[01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:20.560]  It sounds good.
[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:21.320]  It sounds good.
[01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:22.861]  You haven't been breaking up at all.
[01:17:22.861 --> 01:17:25.161]  Okay, it's better than when I was at Bilderberg doing this.
[01:17:25.161 --> 01:17:26.762]  Much better, sir.
[01:17:26.762 --> 01:17:29.723]  Okay, um, again, folks, I apologize.
[01:17:30.546 --> 01:17:34.689]  Taking off this week as my kids start begging me not to go to work in the morning, grabbing my leg.
[01:17:34.689 --> 01:17:35.650]  They never see me anymore.
[01:17:35.650 --> 01:17:37.191]  I've got to take some time off.
[01:17:37.191 --> 01:17:38.372]  But here I am feeling guilty.
[01:17:38.372 --> 01:17:41.615]  Everybody's telling me to take off.
[01:17:41.615 --> 01:17:44.017]  Let me just break this down for everybody listening here.
[01:17:44.017 --> 01:17:51.763]  You know, it's so clear when I'm sitting there watching and all the points I want to make and then getting on air and making them was another thing because there's so many facets to the lies.
[01:17:51.763 --> 01:17:54.686]  And I know people have also been pre-programmed for the lies.
[01:17:55.602 --> 01:18:06.331]  Uh, where it's basically impossible for me to even be able to cover every facet because I know the preconditioned cognitive dissonant program triggers they've got to every point I'm about to make.
[01:18:06.331 --> 01:18:08.393]  Okay.
[01:18:08.393 --> 01:18:21.223]  Bush got up and he said today, A, he's going to open the Gulf of Mexico up to exploration and that it can't be blocked.
[01:18:21.223 --> 01:18:24.266]  Basically after a 60 day, uh, permitting.
[01:18:27.679 --> 01:18:46.890]  And then B, he then said that he wanted to open up only a few thousand acres of ANWR in the northern slope of Alaska.
[01:18:46.890 --> 01:18:56.015]  And then, of course, C, he said, open up permitting for more refineries on a 60-day permitting issue.
[01:18:56.710 --> 01:19:10.414]  Now, let me just go through all three of the facts concerning that, and then when we come back, I can finish up with Barack Obama and his disgusting Al Gore endorsement for total socialism and total taxation, okay?
[01:19:10.414 --> 01:19:12.214]  You got it.
[01:19:12.214 --> 01:19:20.716]  Number one, you can look at maps of this online at the federal government, at the Energy Department website.
[01:19:20.716 --> 01:19:23.597]  They'll let you know where oil drilling is allowed.
[01:19:25.433 --> 01:19:27.635]  And we can cover that when we get back.
[01:19:27.635 --> 01:19:28.076]  That's right, folks.
[01:19:28.076 --> 01:19:30.518]  We're going to be covering the oil crisis.
[01:19:30.518 --> 01:19:32.940]  The artificial oil crisis they're trying to put out there.
[01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:35.202]  So they can make more profits on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:35.202 --> 01:19:37.124]  I'm Jason Bermas with Alex Jones.
[01:19:37.124 --> 01:19:41.148]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com is where you're going to find all the info, folks.
[01:19:41.148 --> 01:19:42.109]  We'll be back after this.
[01:19:51.161 --> 01:19:54.023]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:19:54.023 --> 01:19:55.585]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[01:19:55.585 --> 01:19:57.746]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:19:57.746 --> 01:19:59.648]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:19:59.648 --> 01:20:01.129]  The late great USA.
[01:20:01.129 --> 01:20:02.890]  America, freedom to fascism.

[01:20:52.270 --> 01:20:53.711]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:20:53.711 --> 01:20:59.776]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:20:59.776 --> 01:21:00.577]  That's right.
[01:21:00.577 --> 01:21:03.179]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:21:03.179 --> 01:21:10.345]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:21:10.905 --> 01:21:19.051]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:21:19.051 --> 01:21:24.536]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:21:24.536 --> 01:21:30.340]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:30.340 --> 01:21:34.864]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:21:34.864 --> 01:21:35.124]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:35.124 --> 01:21:36.966]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:21:40.188 --> 01:21:40.469]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:40.469 --> 01:21:40.670]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:50.976 --> 01:21:54.737]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[01:21:54.737 --> 01:21:59.778]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[01:21:59.778 --> 01:22:05.239]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[01:22:05.239 --> 01:22:15.721]  Though the people of the U.S., where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reigning them in and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[01:22:16.221 --> 01:22:20.622]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[01:22:20.622 --> 01:22:23.403]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[01:22:23.403 --> 01:22:26.963]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[01:22:26.963 --> 01:22:39.486]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the Earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.
[01:22:39.946 --> 01:22:43.689]  Visit our website at unveilingthem.com.
[01:22:43.689 --> 01:22:47.993]  That's U-N-V-E-I-L-I-N-G them dot com.
[01:22:47.993 --> 01:22:49.254]  The message of His Kingdom.
[01:22:50.376 --> 01:23:01.124]  When I learned that the accumulation of acidic waste was the likely cause of my painful joints, lack of energy, and weight gain, I knew I would have to change to a more alkaline diet, but it just seemed so difficult.
[01:23:01.124 --> 01:23:10.952]  Then a friend suggested I try a Jupiter water ionizer from SnyderHealth.com and detox my body even before I changed my diet by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[01:23:10.952 --> 01:23:11.713]  Drinking water?
[01:23:12.213 --> 01:23:13.874]  Now that's something I can handle.
[01:23:13.874 --> 01:23:19.557]  The guys at Snyder Health took the time to explain all of the different options and help me choose the ionizer that was right for me.
[01:23:19.557 --> 01:23:31.663]  I use my new Jupiter ionizer for everything, for drinking, for cooking, and since I've been drinking the water, I have more energy, my joint pains are gone, and I already lost 7 pounds, and my skin looks great!
[01:23:31.663 --> 01:23:34.284]  Give them a call today at 877-356-2508 to find out which ionizer is right for you.
[01:23:38.666 --> 01:23:43.549]  They offer a full 30-day money-back guarantee and free shipping, so there's absolutely no risk.
[01:23:43.549 --> 01:23:46.390]  You can visit them on the web at SnyderHealth.com.
[01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:48.952]  That's S-N-Y-D-E-R Health dot com.
[01:23:57.597 --> 01:23:58.658]  All right, folks, we're back.
[01:23:58.658 --> 01:23:59.978]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:23:59.978 --> 01:24:02.300]  I am Jason Bermas, sitting in for Alex.
[01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:06.182]  Alex is with us, though, to discuss the energy non-crisis.
[01:24:06.182 --> 01:24:11.224]  Bush wants to drill everywhere, folks, so his cronies can make more money and they can control us further.
[01:24:11.224 --> 01:24:12.965]  Alex?
[01:24:12.965 --> 01:24:14.786]  Yeah, let me break down the basic facts here.
[01:24:14.786 --> 01:24:15.567]  Bush is a puppet.
[01:24:15.567 --> 01:24:16.867]  He runs a nothing.
[01:24:16.867 --> 01:24:23.791]  They use the fake environmentalist as the excuse, as the front, for why there is these incredible oil prices.
[01:24:24.582 --> 01:24:28.549]  Number one, almost all of the Gulf of Mexico is off-limits to U.S.
[01:24:28.549 --> 01:24:29.771]  companies.
[01:24:29.771 --> 01:24:36.322]  Bush doesn't have to wait for Congress to take the restriction off, for him to take the restriction off.
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:45.044]  The first thing Bush did, I mean literally within two days of being in office, the first thing was he took tens of thousands of square miles that the U.S.
[01:24:45.044 --> 01:24:52.247]  had claimed as its oil reserve and gave it to Pemex, gave it to Mexico as part of a sweetheart deal.
[01:24:52.247 --> 01:24:54.928]  And Mexico's been drilling the living daylights out of it.
[01:24:54.928 --> 01:25:03.953]  Okay, there's another 670-something square mile patch off the coast, about 200 miles out, off the coast of Louisiana.
[01:25:03.953 --> 01:25:06.694]  That thing's got more than ANWR does in it.
[01:25:07.758 --> 01:25:16.765]  So, when you hear him say, oh, we're going to take the restriction off, and then it cuts back to CNN, and they say, yeah, but that'll take years to develop, they could have done this decades ago.
[01:25:16.765 --> 01:25:18.207]  It is being developed.
[01:25:18.207 --> 01:25:20.148]  It's sold to other countries.
[01:25:20.148 --> 01:25:20.909]  They decide.
[01:25:20.909 --> 01:25:22.270]  It's an oligopoly.
[01:25:22.270 --> 01:25:29.015]  The oil companies get together with OPEC and others, and they make these deals to create artificial scarcity.
[01:25:29.015 --> 01:25:33.579]  Now, then he moved on to Alaska.
[01:25:33.579 --> 01:25:36.461]  One field at ANWR in Prudhoe Bay,
[01:25:37.369 --> 01:25:42.433]  It has more discoverable oil than in all of Saudi Arabia, and it's light crude.
[01:25:42.433 --> 01:25:49.178]  It's not sweet like it is in Saudi Arabia, but it's light, meaning very easy to refine, only a couple steps.
[01:25:49.178 --> 01:25:56.844]  Light crude comes out very, very pure compared to what you call crude oil, you know, stuff we think of as being black.
[01:25:56.844 --> 01:25:57.444]  Okay?
[01:25:57.444 --> 01:26:03.589]  And, of course, you have the best stuff, the sweet crude that's almost ready to be put in your tank, with just minimal refining.
[01:26:03.589 --> 01:26:05.230]  That's why Saudi Arabia is so important.
[01:26:07.575 --> 01:26:09.716]  So that's a complete fraud, a complete scam.
[01:26:09.716 --> 01:26:11.177]  It's a political football.
[01:26:11.177 --> 01:26:17.661]  They've been doing this since 1980, throwing the football back and forth, talking about never drilling in Alaska.
[01:26:17.661 --> 01:26:20.943]  And yes, the animal, the caribou population's gone up.
[01:26:20.943 --> 01:26:23.225]  There's no hurting the environment.
[01:26:23.225 --> 01:26:24.846]  They literally cap these wells.
[01:26:24.846 --> 01:26:28.568]  They drill the wells, cap them, and put the pipeline in later.
[01:26:28.568 --> 01:26:31.169]  Totally clean, absolutely amazing.
[01:26:31.169 --> 01:26:36.833]  But 80-plus percent, depending on which year you look at, of the oil out of Anwar goes
[01:26:37.598 --> 01:26:39.780]  One place, and that's Asia.
[01:26:39.780 --> 01:26:50.089]  We only get about 15 to 20 percent, depending on the year, it varies, but never more than 20 on the west coast of the United States.
[01:26:50.089 --> 01:26:52.511]  They only have one pipeline coming into the U.S.
[01:26:52.511 --> 01:26:55.113]  They could build five more in just a year.
[01:26:55.113 --> 01:26:59.958]  They could put them in so fast it would make your head spin, but it isn't going to happen.
[01:26:59.958 --> 01:27:05.102]  They can even pump more out of the few fields they've opened up, but those are all capped.
[01:27:05.566 --> 01:27:07.246]  That was done by the oil companies.
[01:27:07.246 --> 01:27:10.967]  Now, then Bush got into building more refineries.
[01:27:10.967 --> 01:27:19.849]  The only new refinery being built is an expansion of one in Texas by Marathon Energy, which is a smaller oil company.
[01:27:19.849 --> 01:27:24.390]  Marathon, they are the only... and I've even got family that works with them, I'll just leave it at that.
[01:27:24.390 --> 01:27:26.731]  That's the only... Now, here's the deal.
[01:27:26.731 --> 01:27:28.751]  In 95 and 96, the Big Ten met,
[01:27:31.793 --> 01:27:34.454]  AP sued to get the documents in 2000.
[01:27:34.454 --> 01:27:37.675]  We wrote articles about it in the last four years as oil went up.
[01:27:37.675 --> 01:27:47.857]  It is an absolute undeniable fact that 200 plus, 220 something, you can look it up, 200 plus refineries were bought in 96, 97, 98 to 2000.
[01:27:52.029 --> 01:27:54.651]  And they shut them down.
[01:27:54.651 --> 01:27:56.653]  They shut them down.
[01:27:56.653 --> 01:28:08.803]  The oil companies say, not a conspiracy theory, a conspiracy fact, they said there's too much oil in the U.S., too many wildcatters are drilling, they're going to keep the price down because they don't have total police state here.
[01:28:08.803 --> 01:28:11.585]  They do in Saudi Arabia, it is government controlled.
[01:28:11.585 --> 01:28:12.246]  In Alaska,
[01:28:12.987 --> 01:28:19.532]  Where it's 90% plus government owned, what is it, 92% owned government land, state and federal in Alaska.
[01:28:19.532 --> 01:28:25.816]  But in Texas and Oklahoma and Dakotas and all over, they don't have total control.
[01:28:25.816 --> 01:28:40.207]  But they do over the refining, where there's not refining capacity, so there's thousands of capped wells in East Texas alone, because there's no refineries that can take it, because they're all over-refining, and now we're shipping in millions of barrels of refined gas.
[01:28:40.757 --> 01:28:48.339]  Not oil, gasoline each day from huge refineries in Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela, and other places.
[01:28:48.339 --> 01:28:50.660]  And environmentalists, they have no controls there.
[01:28:50.660 --> 01:28:53.000]  They dump it all right in the ocean, you idiots.
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.401]  That's why all this Kyoto stuff's such bull.
[01:28:55.401 --> 01:29:02.063]  Even if you believe it's all true, moving it to China and India means we'll have an increase in pollution instead of here where we have all these controls.
[01:29:02.063 --> 01:29:05.744]  So, there are the facts.
[01:29:05.744 --> 01:29:06.504]  Bush talks about
[01:29:07.574 --> 01:29:09.155]  You hear it here first, folks.
[01:29:09.155 --> 01:29:10.455]  Alex Jones breaking it down.
[01:29:10.455 --> 01:29:10.735]  The truth.
[01:29:34.175 --> 01:29:35.396]  You know where you can find the truth?
[01:29:35.396 --> 01:29:39.299]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:29:39.299 --> 01:29:41.600]  We'll be back after this at the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:43.001]  We're on the march.
[01:29:43.001 --> 01:29:45.523]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:45.523 --> 01:29:48.205]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:33:07.941 --> 01:33:13.466]  It's like 15 cents a day, tons of great movies on there, all of Alex Jones' documentary films.
[01:33:13.466 --> 01:33:18.230]  And coming to the InfoWar this July 4th, the 9-11 Chronicles, Truth Rising will be available.
[01:33:18.230 --> 01:33:24.095]  An amazing picture, cinema verite, unlike anything you've ever seen from Alex Jones before, with confrontations,
[01:33:24.670 --> 01:33:25.410]  Absolutely, Jason.
[01:33:25.410 --> 01:33:27.031]  I'm going to let you get back to the main show.
[01:33:27.031 --> 01:33:28.752]  It's just that this is so important.
[01:33:28.752 --> 01:33:29.753]  We should do a basic article
[01:33:53.169 --> 01:33:53.569]  I don't know.
[01:34:14.484 --> 01:34:20.147]  Well, you've got to, you know, go with our environmental movement, and it all sounds very reasonable.
[01:34:20.147 --> 01:34:23.049]  Hey, we're going to create new jobs with all this.
[01:34:23.049 --> 01:34:24.710]  Hey, we're going to clean up the earth.
[01:34:24.710 --> 01:34:38.077]  Hey, you know, they tack on a bunch of other stuff that's good, but then, at the end of the road, their solution is buying carbon credits and cap-and-trade credits from the private central banks.
[01:34:38.077 --> 01:34:40.358]  It is making them the government.
[01:34:42.501 --> 01:34:44.122]  That's what all this is about.
[01:34:44.122 --> 01:34:46.944]  It is about making them the government.
[01:34:46.944 --> 01:35:06.314]  And to just see Al Gore, you know, introducing Barack Obama and saying he's our savior, as if all this isn't bad enough and all of our industry moving to China and India and Mexico isn't bad enough, we're now going to have taxes and regulation and home inspectors and livestock inspectors and farm and ranch inspectors.
[01:35:06.314 --> 01:35:08.896]  They're talking about millions and millions
[01:35:09.848 --> 01:35:10.349]  Okay.
[01:35:29.804 --> 01:35:31.245]  It's in all their own documents.
[01:35:31.245 --> 01:35:35.927]  Richard N. Haas and the CFR, the Club of Rome, the Nature Conservancy, the Sierra Club.
[01:35:35.927 --> 01:35:40.790]  I've been to the Smart Growth Conferences, and they have all these well-meaning people.
[01:35:40.790 --> 01:35:49.434]  I mean, I hardly ever watch television, but being on a few days vacation, I've been watching a bunch of television, and it's just all environmental propaganda.
[01:35:49.434 --> 01:35:51.855]  It's all environmental manipulation.
[01:35:51.855 --> 01:35:53.136]  It's all environmental
[01:35:53.951 --> 01:35:54.731]  We're good to go.
[01:36:14.207 --> 01:36:17.151]  But the general public does not.
[01:36:17.151 --> 01:36:18.513]  This is feudalism.
[01:36:18.513 --> 01:36:19.775]  This is serfdom.
[01:36:19.775 --> 01:36:20.716]  This is control.
[01:36:20.716 --> 01:36:29.729]  And Boyce the Democrats are going to football it back and forth with all these false reasons of the environment and taxes and, well, you can't put these systems in soon enough.
[01:36:30.601 --> 01:36:35.425]  And it's, unless the people discover why all this is happening, it's only going to get worse.
[01:36:35.425 --> 01:36:39.728]  Jason, I'll talk more about it when I'm back live on Sunday, and I'll probably call the show again tomorrow.
[01:36:39.728 --> 01:36:41.249]  God bless you, and thanks for having me on.
[01:36:41.249 --> 01:36:42.009]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:36:42.009 --> 01:36:43.490]  That's Alex Jones, folks.
[01:36:43.490 --> 01:36:49.835]  A real hero, and I just want to thank him for giving me the opportunity to host the show while he is away.
[01:36:49.835 --> 01:36:55.539]  Before we go back to your calls, yesterday I reported on the fact that, well,
[01:36:56.215 --> 01:36:58.277]  They're chipping some students.
[01:36:58.277 --> 01:37:04.901]  They're not actually putting the chips in the students, but in a Rhode Island school, they are actually chipping their backpacks.
[01:37:04.901 --> 01:37:08.564]  I think it's something like 80 kids are going to have their backpacks chipped.
[01:37:08.564 --> 01:37:15.469]  Well, I got a couple emails from some teachers and they were just like, look, everything you're talking about in the schools is real.
[01:37:15.469 --> 01:37:16.750]  There's cameras everywhere.
[01:37:16.750 --> 01:37:19.172]  The police that are in the schools now are out of control.
[01:37:19.172 --> 01:37:20.553]  Well, I want to I haven't played.
[01:37:20.553 --> 01:37:21.633]  I've only watched the clip.
[01:37:21.633 --> 01:37:25.136]  I don't know what the audio entails, but I'm watching this horrific clip.
[01:37:25.526 --> 01:37:33.031]  From MSNBC, where this cop slams this 16-year-old kid's head into a brick wall.
[01:37:33.031 --> 01:37:35.613]  I'm pretty sure it's either brick or cement.
[01:37:35.613 --> 01:37:37.695]  It's, you know, it's inside of the school.
[01:37:37.695 --> 01:37:39.176]  Into the wall and just puts him down.
[01:37:39.176 --> 01:37:43.219]  16-year-old kid, jackboot cop, let's play it.
[01:37:43.219 --> 01:37:44.840]  Let's play the old Clipscan Hutch.
[01:37:46.423 --> 01:37:47.184]  Take a look at this.
[01:37:47.184 --> 01:37:52.688]  A Michigan police officer caught on tape slamming a teenager's head into a wall.
[01:37:52.688 --> 01:37:55.170]  He knocked out three of the young man's teeth.
[01:37:55.170 --> 01:37:59.473]  It happened after the 16-year-old was arrested for violating rules at a transit center.
[01:37:59.473 --> 01:38:02.756]  You also see the 16-year-old being dragged across the floor.
[01:38:02.756 --> 01:38:05.238]  The officer is suspended without pay.
[01:38:05.238 --> 01:38:12.163]  An investigation found the officer used excessive force but concluded that the teen's injuries were, quote, unintentional.
[01:38:12.163 --> 01:38:13.004]  Unintentional.
[01:38:13.004 --> 01:38:15.306]  Let me just slam your face into a wall.
[01:38:15.819 --> 01:38:17.260]  Break your teeth.
[01:38:17.260 --> 01:38:17.801]  It's okay.
[01:38:17.801 --> 01:38:19.783]  I'm above the law.
[01:38:19.783 --> 01:38:22.465]  There's not going to be any assault charges filed against me.
[01:38:22.465 --> 01:38:23.787]  I've got a badge.
[01:38:23.787 --> 01:38:25.448]  I've got a gun.
[01:38:25.448 --> 01:38:29.252]  Bow down.
[01:38:29.252 --> 01:38:30.153]  It's unreal.
[01:38:30.153 --> 01:38:31.614]  And it's only going to get worse.
[01:38:31.614 --> 01:38:33.416]  The police are only going to get more out of control.
[01:38:33.416 --> 01:38:41.103]  Yesterday I, uh, on the TV show, I showed you, uh, some new Jack boot, uh, t-shirts with, uh, the moustached,
[01:38:41.742 --> 01:38:46.488]  Uh, police officer in his belt, you know, throwing out the scumbags!
[01:38:46.488 --> 01:38:48.591]  He's a scumbag stopper!
[01:38:48.591 --> 01:38:50.313]  It's unbelievable to me.
[01:38:50.313 --> 01:38:51.414]  Unbelievable!
[01:38:51.414 --> 01:38:52.816]  But people buy into that nonsense.
[01:38:52.816 --> 01:38:54.178]  They think that these people are here to help.
[01:38:54.178 --> 01:38:55.339]  They're not here to help.
[01:38:55.339 --> 01:38:57.442]  They're here to go on egotistical power trips.
[01:38:59.525 --> 01:39:03.748]  Alright, we're going to go to callers in a second, but before we do that, we have some sponsors to thank.
[01:39:03.748 --> 01:39:06.009]  Again, they also make this show possible.
[01:39:06.009 --> 01:39:08.851]  Our biggest sponsor is eFoods Direct.
[01:39:08.851 --> 01:39:11.492]  The only sure thing about the future is there is no sure thing.
[01:39:11.492 --> 01:39:15.074]  Storing food for your family is one of the most prudent actions you can take.
[01:39:15.074 --> 01:39:19.077]  No one knows what can or will affect the functioning of society or food distribution.
[01:39:19.077 --> 01:39:21.498]  With stored food, you eliminate the worry.
[01:39:21.498 --> 01:39:26.061]  eFoods Direct is the longest continually operating storable foods company in the United States.
[01:39:26.061 --> 01:39:27.422]  These are the experts.
[01:39:28.002 --> 01:39:31.584]  Hey, I wanted to comment on the addresses that were made to AIPAC by First McCain
[01:39:55.467 --> 01:40:00.728]  And then followed Obama, then last but least relevant was Hillary, of course.
[01:40:00.728 --> 01:40:04.649]  And Barack Obama seemed to be the most pro-Israel out of them all.
[01:40:04.649 --> 01:40:13.371]  He suggested that we should be able to transfer our military technology to Israel with the same ease as we would a NATO nation.
[01:40:13.371 --> 01:40:20.773]  And I would like to bring to his attention the fact that we have given it to Israel, and they did it on Lebanon in 2006.
[01:40:22.342 --> 01:40:26.824]  Cluster bombs that explode with hundreds of bomblets.
[01:40:26.824 --> 01:40:27.304]  The U.N.
[01:40:27.304 --> 01:40:31.266]  Mine Action Coordination Center found hundreds of unexploded U.S.
[01:40:31.266 --> 01:40:39.449]  munitions in 249 locations just south of the Latani River in Lebanon.
[01:40:39.449 --> 01:40:49.613]  And then we're also giving Israel the GBU-28 precision-guided bomb, Bunker Buster, 5,000 pounds of explosives, depleted uranium warhead.
[01:40:50.049 --> 01:40:54.810]  Well, it shouldn't be any kind of a shock that we arm Israel relentlessly.
[01:40:54.810 --> 01:41:02.233]  I mean, even Jimmy Carter, a couple of months ago, came out and said, look at all the weaponry that Israel's allowed to have.
[01:41:02.233 --> 01:41:15.437]  And these cluster bombs Reagan had a problem with, and also Israel, of course, jeopardized our relations, our military relations, with the State Department when, at least twice that I've found, they've tried to sell
[01:41:15.868 --> 01:41:16.709]  We're good to go.
[01:41:42.850 --> 01:41:55.712]  In around December of 2001, and then I believe it was in 2004 they caught the first guy who was connected with Pollard, and then I want to say about a month ago they caught another guy that was connected with Pollard, right?
[01:41:55.712 --> 01:41:56.993]  I'm not familiar with that.
[01:41:56.993 --> 01:42:10.955]  Well, Jonathan Pollard was the one who was convicted in the 90s of spying against the United States, and I know in 2004 they caught another one that was connected to him, and I want to say about a month ago they did catch yet another Israeli spy in this country.
[01:42:12.213 --> 01:42:15.354]  Well, that's good news, and that should gain more publicity.
[01:42:15.354 --> 01:42:19.716]  Of course, all these other spying incidents have not.
[01:42:19.716 --> 01:42:39.445]  And also, all the, like I said, McCain, Hillary, and Obama all mentioned that they had spent some time with these poor Israelis who had been attacked by the Hezbollah, and yet they don't mention that we are providing much more deadly, terrible war crimes, munitions, you know, these cluster bombs.
[01:42:39.977 --> 01:42:45.920]  to the Israelis and they're using them indiscriminately and of course are being found unexploded.
[01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:49.662]  The M-26 artillery rockets is what I was talking about.
[01:42:49.662 --> 01:42:57.527]  You know, these anti-personnel weapons that spray bomblets have been found in many areas of southern Lebanon.
[01:42:57.527 --> 01:43:04.651]  Of course, there's the USS Liberty, where they tried to bring us into the attack on Egypt.
[01:43:04.651 --> 01:43:08.873]  And, you know, just so many instances where
[01:43:09.249 --> 01:43:19.235]  We're Israel, well we're not quite, we're not treating them like quite as an ally because they're arming and they're helping arm our enemies.
[01:43:19.235 --> 01:43:22.437]  Well I think that they're just another arm of this globalist empire.
[01:43:22.437 --> 01:43:23.337]  We love Israel.
[01:43:23.337 --> 01:43:29.501]  I mean seriously, I mean they're our stronghold in the Middle East, even though we now have Afghanistan and Iraq, we set up Israel.
[01:43:30.089 --> 01:43:37.592]  You know, I mean, this was set up by European powers and, you know, we can all debate, quote-unquote, who the Zionists are and what the real motivation of Israel is.
[01:43:37.592 --> 01:43:38.872]  But yeah, they're bad people, man.
[01:43:38.872 --> 01:43:39.473]  I'm down with it.
[01:43:39.473 --> 01:43:41.473]  I mean, they're killing innocent civilians.
[01:43:41.473 --> 01:43:43.134]  They're armed to the teeth.
[01:43:43.134 --> 01:43:45.815]  They seem to be going against United States interests.
[01:43:45.815 --> 01:43:50.717]  But then again, people within our own government are constantly going against U.S.
[01:43:50.717 --> 01:43:50.997]  interests.
[01:43:50.997 --> 01:43:52.457]  They're not foreign by the people, man.
[01:43:52.457 --> 01:43:54.398]  They're foreign by the globalists.
[01:43:54.398 --> 01:43:56.279]  Let's jump to Mike in New York.
[01:43:56.279 --> 01:43:56.919]  Mike, you still there?
[01:43:58.686 --> 01:43:59.426]  Hey, Jason.
[01:43:59.426 --> 01:44:00.367]  Hey, what's up, man?
[01:44:00.367 --> 01:44:01.527]  Hey, doing a great job, man.
[01:44:01.527 --> 01:44:02.088]  Filling it.
[01:44:02.088 --> 01:44:03.088]  Thanks, bro.
[01:44:03.088 --> 01:44:10.231]  Um, the thing I was thinking about the last couple days, and it kind of makes me laugh, uh, shock jock, uh, radio, uh, Don Imus.
[01:44:10.231 --> 01:44:10.431]  Okay.
[01:44:10.431 --> 01:44:11.111]  Lost his job.
[01:44:11.111 --> 01:44:12.432]  Mm-hmm.
[01:44:12.432 --> 01:44:19.555]  You know, and, and this guy, you know, makes an open call, you know, uh, you know, for the death of, uh, Mark Dice.
[01:44:19.555 --> 01:44:22.056]  Oh, well, that's, uh, that's not, uh, Don Imus.
[01:44:22.056 --> 01:44:24.037]  That is, uh, Reagan, Michael Reagan.
[01:44:24.037 --> 01:44:25.818]  No, no, no, I'm saying, I'm saying Don Imus.
[01:44:26.494 --> 01:44:32.418]  You remember, not too long ago back, he made some... Oh yeah, when he lost his job on MSNBC for his nappy-headed hose comment.
[01:44:32.418 --> 01:44:33.658]  Yeah, he made some stupid comments.
[01:44:33.658 --> 01:44:35.799]  That guy loses his job for that.
[01:44:35.799 --> 01:44:41.043]  Meanwhile, this guy calls for the death of somebody and nothing happens.
[01:44:41.043 --> 01:44:42.323]  Well, let's keep the pressure on him.
[01:44:42.323 --> 01:44:47.566]  I mean, I gotta tell you, I'm still pretty upset that... I mean, did anybody think about that?
[01:44:47.566 --> 01:44:55.551]  Yeah, yeah, well, we reported on it yesterday and we actually gave out the number where you could call Roberts, who is the president of the network,
[01:44:56.164 --> 01:44:58.186]  And, uh, I believe you go to MarkDice.com.
[01:44:58.186 --> 01:44:59.367]  You can go check out all that stuff.
[01:44:59.367 --> 01:45:03.591]  His email address is, uh, the number, but we just got to keep putting pressure on him to fire him.
[01:45:03.591 --> 01:45:04.912]  They're hoping this goes away.
[01:45:04.912 --> 01:45:20.886]  You know, they don't want this to get national media attention and the media doesn't really want to give it national attention because as far as I know, this is the first time that a, uh, radio show host has called for the death of an American citizen and said he would pay for the bullets.
[01:45:20.886 --> 01:45:21.527]  Don't you agree, Mike?
[01:45:21.971 --> 01:45:22.731]  Yeah, it's insane.
[01:45:22.731 --> 01:45:23.292]  It's crazy.
[01:45:23.292 --> 01:45:24.893]  Yeah, it's absolutely insane, man.
[01:45:24.893 --> 01:45:25.813]  Thanks for the call.
[01:45:25.813 --> 01:45:28.295]  Let's jump to James in Florida.
[01:45:28.295 --> 01:45:29.976]  James, are you there?
[01:45:29.976 --> 01:45:30.856]  Hey, how's it going?
[01:45:30.856 --> 01:45:31.176]  Good, man.
[01:45:31.176 --> 01:45:32.257]  What's poppin'?
[01:45:32.257 --> 01:45:37.520]  Uh, listen, at 12 o'clock today, I just happened to be going to the store, and I heard, like, a helicopter.
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:40.862]  We've been having a lot of helicopter activity in this area.
[01:45:40.862 --> 01:45:41.423]  Mm-hmm.
[01:45:41.423 --> 01:45:50.548]  So I look up, and I see five military helicopters, three troop transports, and two Apaches heading towards Fort Myers Beach.
[01:45:51.311 --> 01:45:56.715]  So I call up the local news people and I ask them, hey, what's going on?
[01:45:56.715 --> 01:46:00.257]  And they said, well, the president's going to be in town on Friday.
[01:46:00.257 --> 01:46:02.419]  So you must have seen him in Naples.
[01:46:02.419 --> 01:46:04.660]  I said, no, this is Fort Myers.
[01:46:04.660 --> 01:46:07.302]  And I just saw him about 10 minutes ago.
[01:46:07.302 --> 01:46:08.943]  He said, well, that's kind of strange.
[01:46:08.943 --> 01:46:12.426]  We'll go ahead and we'll look into it.
[01:46:12.426 --> 01:46:15.748]  Well, you never know what kind of drills they're running.
[01:46:15.748 --> 01:46:17.289]  It's just like I said yesterday.
[01:46:18.221 --> 01:46:19.962]  Um, black helicopters do exist.
[01:46:19.962 --> 01:46:21.723]  They've existed for quite some time.
[01:46:21.723 --> 01:46:28.987]  Every time I hear somebody go, well that's black helicopter stuff, I can't help but snicker and think to myself, well does that mean you're copping to it's true?
[01:46:28.987 --> 01:46:32.009]  I mean, we had a movie, a Hollywood movie called Black Hawk Down.
[01:46:32.009 --> 01:46:33.070]  How many years ago?
[01:46:33.070 --> 01:46:34.791]  We know black helicopters are in this country.
[01:46:34.791 --> 01:46:40.014]  Right now in Denver, they're openly doing urban warfare training with Apaches and other black helicopters.
[01:46:40.014 --> 01:46:41.655]  You know, you just saw some black helicopters.
[01:46:42.176 --> 01:46:44.177]  They have unmarked helicopters.
[01:46:44.177 --> 01:46:48.058]  They are now part of the urban warfare training against the American people.
[01:46:48.058 --> 01:46:49.879]  People need to wake up, alright?
[01:46:49.879 --> 01:46:54.920]  There's a reason that there's been this transformation in the uniforms and the markings on things.
[01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:56.621]  It's so there's no accountability.
[01:46:56.621 --> 01:47:00.902]  It's so that you can't point out a unit and say, alright, that's the unit from the U.S.
[01:47:00.902 --> 01:47:01.823]  Army or the U.S.
[01:47:01.823 --> 01:47:02.943]  Marines or the U.S.
[01:47:02.943 --> 01:47:03.703]  National Guard.
[01:47:03.703 --> 01:47:05.684]  You just see dudes in black uniforms.
[01:47:05.684 --> 01:47:07.865]  You don't know what, you know, unit they're from.
[01:47:07.865 --> 01:47:11.046]  I mean, when I saw that in Road to Tyranny for the first time,
[01:47:11.536 --> 01:47:12.057]  I don't know.
[01:47:23.146 --> 01:47:26.728]  A little public library, and everybody had black masks on, and they're putting off flash bangers.
[01:47:26.728 --> 01:47:28.990]  And I'm thinking to myself, why are they doing this?
[01:47:28.990 --> 01:47:30.230]  It's for anonymity!
[01:47:30.230 --> 01:47:38.175]  It's so when they go and round you up, if you happen to survive, or you want a redress of grievances, you've got no one to put those grievances against.
[01:47:38.175 --> 01:47:39.396]  And I would just keep pressing them.
[01:47:39.396 --> 01:47:41.237]  I'd be like, look, why are there Apaches around?
[01:47:41.237 --> 01:47:42.538]  Is there a drill going on?
[01:47:42.538 --> 01:47:43.799]  Call up Fort Myers.
[01:47:43.799 --> 01:47:45.240]  I mean, we got to keep pressing forward.
[01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:49.342]  If you find out any other info, please email it to us at Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[01:47:49.342 --> 01:47:50.303]  I thank you for the call, James.
[01:47:50.723 --> 01:47:52.124]  All right, let's jump to yet another caller.
[01:47:52.124 --> 01:47:53.785]  Let's go to Ken in California.
[01:47:53.785 --> 01:47:55.486]  Ken, are you there?
[01:47:55.486 --> 01:47:56.327]  Hello, Jason.
[01:47:56.327 --> 01:47:57.808]  How you doing, sir?
[01:47:57.808 --> 01:47:58.809]  I'm hanging in there.
[01:47:58.809 --> 01:47:59.849]  I had a novel idea.
[01:47:59.849 --> 01:48:16.601]  I was listening to you and Mr. Jones speaking, and I'm wondering, as American citizens, since each state is a sovereign state in its own right and has its own constitution, why can't we, as the people of each state, charge our federal government with treason to our federal constitution?
[01:48:17.524 --> 01:48:18.665]  I think we can.
[01:48:18.665 --> 01:48:20.246]  I don't know what... Why don't we?
[01:48:20.246 --> 01:48:24.409]  I mean, why can't all these movements... See, the government loves division.
[01:48:24.409 --> 01:48:26.751]  I mean, you see it firsthand every day.
[01:48:26.751 --> 01:48:28.392]  And they've got enough division going on.
[01:48:28.392 --> 01:48:30.854]  Why don't the people just stand up and say, hey, enough already?
[01:48:30.854 --> 01:48:32.415]  I'll tell you why.
[01:48:32.415 --> 01:48:38.220]  Because as soon as you organize like that and you do pose a real threat, it makes it awfully easy for COINTELPRO to come in.
[01:48:38.220 --> 01:48:41.342]  Now, I'm not saying that means let's not organize, let's not push forward.
[01:48:41.707 --> 01:48:51.927]  I'm just pointing out, as soon as you centralize all the patriot movement, it's going to be a lot easier for them to stick in someone who's going to seem legitimate at first, just like in the 9-11 truth movement.
[01:48:51.927 --> 01:48:53.871]  They're going to come on, they're going to say all the right things.
[01:48:54.403 --> 01:49:03.389]  And then, just like in the 9-11 Truth Movement, instead of saying things like, uh, space beams or no planes hit the towers, they're going to say, we need to violently overthrow our leaders.
[01:49:03.389 --> 01:49:13.415]  It's going to turn from a peaceful initiative where we put out a resolution for secession, uh, just like these people in Oklahoma did, to people calling for the hanging and murders of public officials.
[01:49:13.415 --> 01:49:14.135]  You watch.
[01:49:14.135 --> 01:49:17.357]  Well, I don't think, I don't think we're quite there yet.
[01:49:17.357 --> 01:49:21.160]  Um, really, I mean, but, but what I'm thinking, you know, uh, I, you know,
[01:49:21.801 --> 01:49:31.544]  My whole thing is, and I agree with Alex Jones on this, 1776 is the answer to the Patriot Act and all these bad laws.
[01:49:31.544 --> 01:49:32.865]  We are the people.
[01:49:32.865 --> 01:49:48.269]  What we need to do is prosecute and convict the federal criminals that have violated and voided the Constitution of this once great nation, and the charges simply be high treason and violations of the oath of office, counterfeiting of currency from 1913 to present, violations of the U.S.
[01:49:48.269 --> 01:49:50.090]  Constitution, for instance,
[01:49:50.869 --> 01:49:54.393]  The Bill of Rights Article I through X, and there's too many others.
[01:49:54.393 --> 01:49:55.634]  You know, we don't have enough time.
[01:49:55.634 --> 01:49:57.035]  Well, yeah, I'm with you.
[01:49:57.035 --> 01:50:01.359]  Right now, I see an opportunity with Kucinich's 35 articles of impeachment.
[01:50:01.359 --> 01:50:04.202]  I mean, you just talked about the Federal Reserve Banking System.
[01:50:04.202 --> 01:50:06.524]  Surely we can't get rid of the Bush administration for that.
[01:50:06.524 --> 01:50:07.925]  I do see the problem with that.
[01:50:07.925 --> 01:50:16.073]  Ultimately, you know, it is the banking system that enslaves us, and that's why I was such a huge fan, and still am, of Ron Paul.
[01:50:16.073 --> 01:50:16.533]  A lot of people
[01:50:17.028 --> 01:50:21.671]  Couldn't get behind him because he wasn't pro 9-11 truth movement or he didn't say what everybody wanted to say.
[01:50:21.671 --> 01:50:23.532]  He was going after the root of the problem.
[01:50:23.532 --> 01:50:25.293]  He was going after the money masters.
[01:50:25.293 --> 01:50:27.355]  You know, so I think we all have a separate place.
[01:50:27.355 --> 01:50:28.235]  I thank you for the call.
[01:50:28.235 --> 01:50:30.997]  We're going to take calls on the other side of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:50:30.997 --> 01:50:36.801]  Then at the top of the hour, we're going to have a big talk about chemtrails with Rosalind Peterson.
[01:50:36.801 --> 01:50:38.162]  I'm really looking forward to that.
[01:50:38.162 --> 01:50:40.183]  PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com.
[01:50:40.183 --> 01:50:41.484]  We'll be back after these messages.
[01:50:51.226 --> 01:50:53.187]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:50:53.187 --> 01:50:56.789]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:50:56.789 --> 01:50:58.890]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:50:58.890 --> 01:51:02.291]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:51:02.291 --> 01:51:08.034]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:51:08.034 --> 01:51:11.936]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:26.080]  I think so.
[01:54:00.646 --> 01:54:22.040]  In 1814 we took a little trip Along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi We took a little bacon and we took a little beans And we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin' There wasn't as many as there was a while ago We fired once more and they began to run it On down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
[01:54:24.981 --> 01:54:26.542]  Alright, it's the Alex Jones Show!
[01:54:44.610 --> 01:54:45.370]  I'm Jason Bermas.

[01:54:49.311 --> 01:54:50.251]  Checked in with us earlier.

[01:55:42.940 --> 01:55:47.662]  Or go to infowars.com and click on the big ol' banner.
[01:55:47.662 --> 01:55:50.963]  The number to call is 866-762-9238.
[01:55:50.963 --> 01:55:54.705]  That's 866-762-9238.
[01:55:54.705 --> 01:56:01.388]  Alright, let's jump through a couple callers before we have the big chemtrail discussion.
[01:56:01.388 --> 01:56:02.589]  I'm actually pretty interested in it.
[01:56:02.589 --> 01:56:03.509]  You know, I know they're there.
[01:56:04.681 --> 01:56:07.542]  I know that this woman doesn't refer to them as chemtrails.
[01:56:07.542 --> 01:56:11.623]  I think she refers to them as weather modification tools.
[01:56:11.623 --> 01:56:16.564]  It is California Sky Watch's Rosalind Peterson and she'll be on momentarily.
[01:56:16.564 --> 01:56:17.504]  Let's jump to another caller.
[01:56:17.504 --> 01:56:18.204]  Let's take Betty.
[01:56:18.204 --> 01:56:19.264]  Betty, are you there?
[01:56:19.264 --> 01:56:20.364]  Yes, I am, Jason.
[01:56:20.364 --> 01:56:21.405]  How are you today?
[01:56:21.405 --> 01:56:22.525]  Good, how are you?
[01:56:22.525 --> 01:56:23.305]  I'm doing good.
[01:56:23.305 --> 01:56:28.606]  I'm glad to hear that you and I've got to commend you and Alex Jones for putting this out over the internet.
[01:56:30.071 --> 01:56:35.596]  What I wanted to tell you was, that movie Jericho in 24, I used to watch it all the time.
[01:56:35.596 --> 01:56:41.080]  And I believed in what they had on there, it was showing what the government can do.
[01:56:41.080 --> 01:56:57.494]  Now, what I want to share with you is, here in North Carolina, they got this new system now, where when you go to go get your driver's license or your ID card, that you have to prove, give them your marriage license, your birth certificate, your social security card, and proof of residency.
[01:56:58.041 --> 01:57:01.122]  And isn't that, what's that, the seven points that they want from you?
[01:57:01.122 --> 01:57:02.762]  Yes.
[01:57:02.762 --> 01:57:08.004]  See, I have that problem in New York too sometimes, and luckily I know a couple people at the DMV.
[01:57:08.004 --> 01:57:13.545]  I feel like if I already have a license, the fact that I'm walking in there with a New York State license should be enough.
[01:57:13.545 --> 01:57:15.366]  They shouldn't need seven more points.
[01:57:15.366 --> 01:57:16.906]  But it's this total surveillance society.
[01:57:16.906 --> 01:57:20.307]  For instance, I went to Bank of America last week.
[01:57:20.307 --> 01:57:22.348]  Now, I had a thousand dollar money order.
[01:57:22.961 --> 01:57:33.785]  Okay, from Bank of America to Bank of America, I walk into Bank of America, I give them my ID card, my New York State driver's license, and they ask me if I have a second form of identification.
[01:57:33.785 --> 01:57:39.106]  And I say, sure, you know, I've got my medical card here, I've got my AFTF card here.
[01:57:39.106 --> 01:57:42.648]  No, no, no, we need a credit card, or we need a bank card.
[01:57:42.648 --> 01:57:44.988]  And I'm like, well, I don't subscribe to those programs, you know?
[01:57:44.988 --> 01:57:48.129]  I don't need a bank taking care of my money, and I don't need to be in credit debt.
[01:57:48.129 --> 01:57:49.650]  And they're like, well, we can't do anything for you.
[01:57:50.245 --> 01:57:51.906]  And I'm like, are you kidding me?
[01:57:51.906 --> 01:57:53.867]  And it was just this whole fiasco.
[01:57:53.867 --> 01:57:58.430]  I had to have Corey go down to the Bank of America in New York.
[01:57:58.430 --> 01:58:00.511]  They had to give me a phone number to call.
[01:58:00.511 --> 01:58:01.351]  I had to go back in.
[01:58:01.351 --> 01:58:02.492]  I had to talk to two tellers.
[01:58:02.492 --> 01:58:03.293]  They had to call up.
[01:58:03.293 --> 01:58:06.635]  It's total and complete enslavement.
[01:58:06.635 --> 01:58:08.416]  They want as much as they can get from you.
[01:58:08.416 --> 01:58:09.816]  I thank you for the call, Betty.
[01:58:09.816 --> 01:58:11.357]  Yeah, that's the society we live in.
[01:58:11.357 --> 01:58:12.238]  Those are the times.
[01:58:12.238 --> 01:58:14.879]  They want it all to enslave us.
[01:58:14.879 --> 01:58:18.241]  The Alex Jones Show will be back with Rosalynn Peterson after this.
[01:58:18.241 --> 01:58:19.282]  Infowars.com!
[01:58:33.151 --> 01:58:35.775]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:39.039 --> 01:58:43.285]  It is a big idea.
[01:58:43.285 --> 01:58:46.109]  A new world order.
[01:58:46.109 --> 01:58:46.990]  In the near future.
[01:58:47.924 --> 01:58:51.007]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:58:51.007 --> 01:58:53.829]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:58:53.829 --> 01:58:56.612]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[01:58:56.612 --> 01:58:59.795]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:58:59.795 --> 01:59:07.121]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:59:10.142 --> 01:59:15.584]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:59:15.584 --> 01:59:19.465]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:59:19.465 --> 01:59:22.025]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:59:22.025 --> 01:59:23.186]  Most people have no idea.
[01:59:23.186 --> 01:59:23.966]  They're not after money.
[01:59:23.966 --> 01:59:25.206]  They have all the money they need.
[01:59:25.206 --> 01:59:26.206]  They're after power.
[01:59:26.206 --> 01:59:27.367]  That's what Apple needs here.

[01:59:38.875 --> 01:59:44.061]  You have been warned.
[01:59:44.061 --> 01:59:46.464]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:46.464 --> 01:59:49.227]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.239 --> 02:00:04.359]  I just love it when that music plays, don't you?
[02:00:04.359 --> 02:00:05.100]  It sounds epic!
[02:00:05.100 --> 02:00:08.620]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:08.620 --> 02:00:09.300]  I'm Jason Bermas.
[02:00:09.300 --> 02:00:11.221]  I'm going to be sitting in the rest of the week.
[02:00:11.221 --> 02:00:15.101]  My little website is loosechange911.com.
[02:00:15.101 --> 02:00:20.222]  Producer of Loose Change encouraging you, the listeners, to go to Google Video.
[02:00:20.222 --> 02:00:25.683]  Get a link and spread it across this country and the world.
[02:00:25.683 --> 02:00:28.984]  Right now I'm pleased to announce that we have Rosalind Peterson
[02:00:30.154 --> 02:00:37.179]  of CaliforniaSkyWatch.com and she's here to talk about weather modification and what's going on in the skies.
[02:00:37.179 --> 02:00:39.401]  Rosalind, I thank you for joining us.
[02:00:39.401 --> 02:00:40.342]  Oh, you're quite welcome.
[02:00:40.342 --> 02:00:42.423]  It's a pleasure to be on your show.
[02:00:42.423 --> 02:00:48.608]  So why don't you tell us how you got involved in all this and why you started California Sky Watch.
[02:00:48.608 --> 02:00:56.654]  Well, starting in 2002, it came to my attention that our skies were no longer deep blue.
[02:00:57.406 --> 02:01:05.850]  They were filled with persistent jet contrails and jets flying in every direction, leaving these great huge plumes.
[02:01:05.850 --> 02:01:15.475]  And so in 2002, I knew from just looking at these planes and photographing them and filming them that this was not correct.
[02:01:15.475 --> 02:01:18.456]  This was not how our skies should look.
[02:01:18.456 --> 02:01:23.859]  And so when I saw the crosshatches, the loops, the X's when they looped the loop,
[02:01:24.967 --> 02:01:29.109]  Um, it just brought me to the conclusion that this was not right.
[02:01:29.109 --> 02:01:30.810]  We had to find out what was going on.
[02:01:30.810 --> 02:01:49.878]  And so then I have dedicated, uh, my time since then to, uh, putting up California Skywatch and also to, um, talking to people across the country and discussing what I have found out from diligent research, uh, from myself and from others.
[02:01:49.878 --> 02:01:53.600]  Well, you know, I'm not that, you know, in the light about what
[02:01:54.002 --> 02:01:55.066]  We're good to go.
[02:01:59.687 --> 02:02:02.188]  You know, everybody talks, well, is it weather modification?
[02:02:02.188 --> 02:02:08.612]  I've heard people think it's mind control, but all's I do know is in the past few years, I've seen plenty of them.
[02:02:08.612 --> 02:02:11.973]  And especially where I live in New York, they're, they're up spraying every day.
[02:02:11.973 --> 02:02:18.437]  I've seen a couple out in Austin, Texas, but I've literally driven across the country a couple of times now and they're there.
[02:02:18.437 --> 02:02:21.658]  And there is no official reason why they're there.
[02:02:21.658 --> 02:02:26.240]  And California is one of the few places where there was like a mainline report about chemtrails.
[02:02:26.240 --> 02:02:27.161]  I think it was on, uh,
[02:02:27.688 --> 02:02:30.409]  I'm not sure if it was out of Los Angeles, but it was a local NBC station.
[02:02:30.409 --> 02:02:32.571]  If you type that in, you can watch the YouTube clip.
[02:02:32.571 --> 02:02:37.173]  Otherwise, there's been almost a media blackout on the subject.
[02:02:37.173 --> 02:02:38.313]  Yes, and that's correct.
[02:02:38.313 --> 02:02:48.839]  There has been a media blackout because when I first started my research, I checked the United States Air Force website almost immediately.
[02:02:49.505 --> 02:02:54.408]  To find out what was going on, and a lot of people have talked about chemtrails.
[02:02:54.408 --> 02:03:11.817]  It was kind of on the web, and I decided that I'd go see what they had to say, and right away I realized that their website carried a notation that the word chemtrail was a hoax, and that there was nothing going on, everything was normal.
[02:03:11.817 --> 02:03:18.421]  And then when I wrote my senator, Dianne Feinstein, with regard to these persistent jet contrails, and to find out
[02:03:18.962 --> 02:03:21.365]  More about what was going on.
[02:03:21.365 --> 02:03:32.236]  The response came back from the United States Air Force, stating that the word chemtrail was a hoax, everything was fine, and I should just go away.
[02:03:32.236 --> 02:03:35.099]  And the same with the letter from Senator Feinstein.
[02:03:35.099 --> 02:03:41.105]  So at this point, I had talked to the media, and I found that the media
[02:03:41.843 --> 02:04:10.323]  would be interested for about five minutes and then they would either call the Air Force or they call NOAA or NASA and these gentlemen would say well there's nothing going on it's all normal and so therefore they would say well the word chemtrail is a hoax and then that was the end of the discussion so I have found that by not using the word chemtrail by talking about the documents by talking about the research
[02:04:10.982 --> 02:04:22.508]  And the studies and different things that I can document, that the credibility goes up when you start talking about what's going on with these persistent jet contrails.
[02:04:22.508 --> 02:04:25.870]  Well, we're going to come back after this and we're going to find out what you found out.
[02:04:25.870 --> 02:04:30.512]  Her site has things on HAARF, air pollution, climate change.
[02:04:30.512 --> 02:04:31.813]  It's all there.
[02:04:31.813 --> 02:04:33.474]  It's CaliforniaSkyWatch.com.
[02:04:33.474 --> 02:04:34.354]  We'll be back after this.
[02:04:34.354 --> 02:04:35.195]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:04:48.385 --> 02:04:51.228]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[02:04:51.228 --> 02:04:52.789]  Loose change, final cut.

[02:04:54.951 --> 02:04:56.613]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[02:04:56.733 --> 02:04:57.013]  I think so.
[02:05:14.981 --> 02:05:17.744]  Or you would like a book on the history of the Federal Reserve.
[02:05:17.744 --> 02:05:20.827]  We've got the most well-researched and documented titles.

[02:05:51.488 --> 02:05:56.889]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[02:05:56.889 --> 02:06:02.030]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[02:06:02.030 --> 02:06:13.153]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[02:06:13.553 --> 02:06:19.338]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:06:19.338 --> 02:06:25.604]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[02:06:25.604 --> 02:06:26.645]  What about you?

[02:06:50.606 --> 02:06:54.729]  By the age of 60, half of all men have a prostate-related problem.
[02:06:54.729 --> 02:07:01.334]  In the past, many men have turned to saw palmetto to support prostate health, but now there's something much better.
[02:07:01.334 --> 02:07:02.976]  It's called beta-prostate.
[02:07:02.976 --> 02:07:08.500]  Beta-prostate contains 3,000 times more healthy plant sterols than ordinary saw palmetto.
[02:07:08.500 --> 02:07:14.405]  In fact, you'd have to take a hundred saw palmetto capsules to get the same benefits of one dose of beta-prostate.
[02:07:14.665 --> 02:07:20.389]  It's guaranteed to provide noticeable support even if you're already having prostate-related health issues.

[02:08:11.779 --> 02:08:12.560]  I'm Jason Bermas.
[02:08:12.560 --> 02:08:13.281]  I'll be filling in
[02:08:14.048 --> 02:08:19.169]  For the remainder of the week, you can get at me at MySpace.com slash Jason Burmas.
[02:08:19.169 --> 02:08:30.853]  We're talking to Rosalind Peterson of CaliforniaSkyWatch.com, and she was telling us how she was stonewalled almost at every turn when she tried to find out what was going on in the skies.
[02:08:30.853 --> 02:08:35.154]  And I'm guessing this is when you started to collect your own data.
[02:08:35.154 --> 02:08:42.576]  This is when I started to go and really do some heavy-duty research and try and find out what was going on.
[02:08:43.737 --> 02:08:52.399]  And then take pictures, videotapes of what was going on in the skies with a group of other people who were also interested.
[02:08:52.399 --> 02:09:01.441]  And also trying to figure out why everyone was stonewalled on this subject and just told that it was normal.
[02:09:01.441 --> 02:09:08.763]  I can tell you from long history here in Mendocino County that very few commercial airlines fly over Mendocino County.
[02:09:08.763 --> 02:09:12.804]  And according to FAA records of the flights, they fly straight lines.
[02:09:13.423 --> 02:09:17.467]  And they only go across really one segment of the county.
[02:09:17.467 --> 02:09:26.696]  And there's very few flights that go into San Francisco Airport or San Jose or Oakland Airports that fly over this area.
[02:09:26.696 --> 02:09:32.242]  But the jets that leave the persistent contrails fly in every direction.
[02:09:32.242 --> 02:09:35.525]  Stop and go plumes circling
[02:09:36.247 --> 02:09:41.952]  Sometimes they look like two or three at a time doing a racetrack around our county.
[02:09:41.952 --> 02:09:46.296]  You can watch them with binoculars and sometimes they don't even fly out of sight.
[02:09:46.296 --> 02:09:53.842]  They just play tag with on and off, turning the contrails on and off over our skies.
[02:09:53.842 --> 02:10:02.609]  Other times we're just hazed over in about three hours or they produce different types of man-made clouds or we get black contrails.
[02:10:03.945 --> 02:10:14.328]  Combinations of weird weather patterns that change after they start to hit our skies hard.
[02:10:14.328 --> 02:10:17.869]  So after all this research, you know, everybody always asks me, what are they?
[02:10:17.869 --> 02:10:18.530]  What are they?
[02:10:18.530 --> 02:10:19.690]  What are they?
[02:10:19.690 --> 02:10:25.192]  What do you think the purpose of this campaign is?
[02:10:25.192 --> 02:10:31.774]  I can't answer that question for you because I can only speculate on that answer.
[02:10:32.549 --> 02:10:41.934]  However, what I can tell you from my research is that jets are used in a number of different programs.
[02:10:41.934 --> 02:10:52.078]  NOAA lists over 50 experimental weather modification programs that are ongoing, which use both air-based and ground-based chemicals.
[02:10:52.078 --> 02:10:53.439]  In other words, the U.S.
[02:10:53.439 --> 02:11:01.763]  Air Force flies over and drops aluminum-coated fiberglass, which is chaff, over us, which falls to the ground as particulate matter.
[02:11:02.908 --> 02:11:04.908]  And can have health effects.
[02:11:04.908 --> 02:11:06.309]  It's been noted.
[02:11:06.309 --> 02:11:14.271]  Although the Air Force doesn't like to give out their reports, but it has been noted that there's health effects from the particulates.
[02:11:14.271 --> 02:11:24.233]  And we're not sure because we can't find the studies for what is happening when the aluminum in this fiberglass particulate comes down to the ground.
[02:11:24.233 --> 02:11:27.694]  So we do know that the jets are used in different programs.
[02:11:30.605 --> 02:11:52.522]  I cannot tell you from all of my research exactly what the jets are releasing to leave these persistent contrails, but Patrick Minnis of NASA has now admitted that many of these contrails, one contrail, can expand over 4,000 square kilometers and last for more than 20 hours.
[02:11:52.522 --> 02:11:57.206]  This was unheard of before about 1988.
[02:11:59.123 --> 02:12:05.526]  They're about when people first started noticing them, especially here in Northern California.
[02:12:05.526 --> 02:12:23.395]  So, Professor Gregory Benford on the program with Paul Moyer in Burbank, California, KNBC News program, which anyone can watch on YouTube, had stated that it was kind of interesting that
[02:12:24.284 --> 02:12:39.909]  When Benford was asked about this issue, he said, well, a little bit of barium, a little bit of aluminum, and we can make fluffy white clouds, and we can put them where we want to do what we want, essentially was the context of that.
[02:12:39.909 --> 02:12:50.272]  So, unless they've experimented, we do know that that's the case at this time, is that something is going on, and it's probably called geoengineering.
[02:12:50.580 --> 02:12:56.582]  Yeah, and let's make it clear, uh, aluminum oxide and barium are not healthy for human consumption.
[02:12:56.582 --> 02:12:57.882]  That is correct.
[02:12:57.882 --> 02:13:04.224]  I mean, these are heavy metals that we're more than likely breathing in as this dissipates and falls to the ground.
[02:13:04.224 --> 02:13:08.125]  And it doesn't shock me that they, they cover such a wide area.
[02:13:08.125 --> 02:13:14.827]  I'll literally be outside at around 10 or 11 in the morning out in New York and you'll see them start their campaign.
[02:13:14.827 --> 02:13:17.568]  And then by sundown, you know, around five,
[02:13:18.616 --> 02:13:23.720]  530, the entire, you know, sky is in a haze and we had blue skies in the morning.
[02:13:23.720 --> 02:13:28.744]  I've got to wonder why they're doing this and why they've seemed to up the program.
[02:13:28.744 --> 02:13:33.568]  I mean, you used to see it now and then and people would say, oh, you're kooky, nothing's going on.
[02:13:33.568 --> 02:13:37.411]  That's just, you know, fuel from a commercial airliner.
[02:13:37.411 --> 02:13:39.513]  That's just the gas coming out of it.
[02:13:39.513 --> 02:13:40.354]  It's nothing, Jason.
[02:13:40.354 --> 02:13:44.217]  But now, you know, I literally have people calling it plain foam.
[02:13:44.568 --> 02:13:45.929]  You know, they don't know what it is.
[02:13:45.929 --> 02:13:47.509]  They don't know what's bad for them.
[02:13:47.509 --> 02:13:51.471]  You know, they think everything's all right, but they've given it their own name for it.
[02:13:51.471 --> 02:13:53.832]  And the fact of the matter is, this is toxic.
[02:13:53.832 --> 02:13:54.773]  This is poisonous.
[02:13:54.773 --> 02:13:56.994]  And we don't know what the agenda is.
[02:13:56.994 --> 02:14:03.397]  And you've done some of the most extensive work out there, and you don't know, you know, what exactly the agenda is on this.
[02:14:03.397 --> 02:14:09.860]  Is there any, uh, is there anybody out there in politics that's interested in this subject that's going to try to tackle it?
[02:14:09.860 --> 02:14:11.661]  Anyone in Congress, anyone in the House, anything?
[02:14:12.859 --> 02:14:21.325]  No, because they refer to it as a chemtrail hoax, and as long as the word chemtrail is attached, they don't want to touch the issue.
[02:14:21.325 --> 02:14:34.794]  And that's why I've stopped using the word, because they politically don't want to touch something that the Air Force calls a hoax, that NASA and NOAA call a hoax, and part of a conspiracy theory, so thus they don't want to touch it.
[02:14:34.794 --> 02:14:38.156]  But we're making inroads, because we're beginning to show them
[02:14:39.017 --> 02:15:02.385]  The State of California Water Test results from all 58 counties, a CD held by the California State Department of Health, which shows spiking in all over the state of California, sometimes way above state and federal standards, all in the same time of aluminum, barium, manganese, some of these heavy metals.
[02:15:02.385 --> 02:15:05.966]  And we're finding that this exposure
[02:15:06.574 --> 02:15:10.235]  is quite broad, all over California.
[02:15:10.235 --> 02:15:16.698]  And a friend of mine has done extensive research from 1998 in Arizona.
[02:15:16.698 --> 02:15:22.219]  Bridget Conroy has also been finding huge spikes in Arizona as well.
[02:15:22.219 --> 02:15:35.204]  So we're looking at these water test data and samples from, in other words, not even our own particular data where we went out and took the test ourselves, but from the state of California and the Arizona.
[02:15:36.062 --> 02:15:45.425]  And we find that they're confirming what we've been knowing for a long time is that there's something going on and we're being exposed to it.
[02:15:45.425 --> 02:15:58.310]  But you see, it's not only the exposure in our drinking water system, it's the exposure to the animals, to the trees, to crops, to all kinds of... It's incredible.
[02:15:58.310 --> 02:16:04.672]  The pH of rainwater is beginning to get more acidic, so we're seeing a wide range of things that are happening to the environment.
[02:16:05.726 --> 02:16:28.267]  And my concern about persistent jet contrails, specifically, is that when they cover a sober and white haze or man-made clouds, according to NASA, persistent jet contrails make man-made clouds that exacerbate global warming, that these clouds change our climate and can impact negatively natural resources.
[02:16:29.073 --> 02:16:38.118]  And when you start to take away direct sunlight, you start to reduce photosynthesis, which is required for all living things to grow.
[02:16:38.118 --> 02:16:45.042]  And since my background is agriculture, I've been taking a look at trees and crops.
[02:16:45.042 --> 02:16:49.725]  And without direct sunlight, crop production is going to drop severely.
[02:16:49.725 --> 02:16:53.267]  So you think this is maybe even kind of a terraforming program for the Earth?
[02:16:53.267 --> 02:16:56.149]  Basically stopping our crops, stopping our healthy growth,
[02:16:56.519 --> 02:17:05.224]  Stopping plants from growing in a certain manner, really just changing the way that everything's produced in this country.
[02:17:05.224 --> 02:17:06.505]  It's going to do that.
[02:17:06.505 --> 02:17:19.533]  And when you talk about the jet contrails putting this man-made cloud curver over us, stopping direct sunlight from reaching the earth, not only that, you have an impact from increased molds, mildew.
[02:17:21.130 --> 02:17:39.474]  Health effects like rickets are increasing across the United States in the last few years, and that's lack of vitamin D. And these children are getting brittle bones, not seen since children were forced to work in the coal mines in the early part of our history.
[02:17:39.474 --> 02:17:46.015]  So, it's beginning to be of great concern, but that means that if children are seeing rickets, that means other animals
[02:17:46.676 --> 02:17:48.897]  And plant life are going to be affected as well.
[02:17:48.897 --> 02:17:54.799]  So the implication of keeping us in this man-made cloud cover is tremendous.
[02:17:54.799 --> 02:17:58.781]  And I see them pushing this as saving us from global warming.
[02:17:58.781 --> 02:18:05.123]  You know, eventually I think they're going to have to say something about this program and they're going to say, well, you know, we had to put this program out there.
[02:18:05.123 --> 02:18:08.224]  It'd be just so hot and global warming would have done this to us.
[02:18:08.224 --> 02:18:10.065]  So we're actually trying to save you.
[02:18:10.065 --> 02:18:12.826]  You know, it is very much like 1984 where, you know, truth is lies.
[02:18:15.359 --> 02:18:19.060]  And black is white and white is black because first they deny it.
[02:18:19.060 --> 02:18:20.521]  You know, nothing's going on.
[02:18:20.521 --> 02:18:21.941]  Chemtrails are a hoax.
[02:18:21.941 --> 02:18:24.862]  Now we know that, you know, this is going on.
[02:18:24.862 --> 02:18:26.463]  There is some sort of program.
[02:18:26.463 --> 02:18:28.023]  Now they're going to act like our saviors.
[02:18:28.023 --> 02:18:30.924]  I think that's what's next on the on the agenda.
[02:18:30.924 --> 02:18:36.006]  Well, of course, that's why the global warming drumbeat to get people into hysteria.
[02:18:36.006 --> 02:18:40.588]  So they'll do anything to allow our geoengineers.
[02:18:40.588 --> 02:18:44.029]  These are people that want to change our our atmospheric conditions.
[02:18:44.778 --> 02:18:46.599]  To reduce global warming.
[02:18:46.599 --> 02:18:48.980]  And so that drumbeat is here, alright.
[02:18:48.980 --> 02:19:08.249]  But what happens is, that doesn't explain, because when you take away direct sunlight by putting up chemicals, and you reduce the amount of direct sunlight hitting the Earth, you see NASA goes right back and says, well, according to their studies, they're trapping warmth in the atmosphere and exacerbating global warming.
[02:19:08.249 --> 02:19:11.590]  So, if they're doing this for us, what
[02:19:13.126 --> 02:19:13.927]  What does this mean?
[02:19:13.927 --> 02:19:17.430]  I don't think anybody's doing anything for us.
[02:19:17.430 --> 02:19:21.474]  Because I think that they're experimenting at our expense, is what I think.
[02:19:21.474 --> 02:19:22.495]  I'm with you there.
[02:19:22.495 --> 02:19:27.400]  On the other side, we're going to play this NBC News clip, Chemtrails Over California.
[02:19:27.400 --> 02:19:28.501]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:19:28.501 --> 02:19:31.805]  We have Rosalind Peterson of Californiaskywatch.com.
[02:19:48.274 --> 02:19:50.856]  Do you stay up late worrying about your teen driver?
[02:19:50.856 --> 02:19:54.218]  Do you need to know the exact location of a loved one or a company vehicle?
[02:19:54.218 --> 02:19:58.220]  What can you do if your vehicle becomes one of the thousands annually targeted for theft?
[02:19:58.220 --> 02:20:06.605]  Now you can log into your own personal website and view the exact location of your vehicle, stationary or moving, in real time, 24 hours a day.
[02:20:06.605 --> 02:20:10.548]  Introducing NowTrack, a revolutionary new GPS vehicle tracking device
[02:20:10.708 --> 02:20:10.988]  I think so.
[02:20:25.785 --> 02:20:26.426]  We're good to go!
[02:20:48.107 --> 02:20:54.771]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:20:54.771 --> 02:21:02.896]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:21:02.896 --> 02:21:10.721]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:21:11.061 --> 02:21:16.144]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:21:16.144 --> 02:21:21.367]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:21:21.367 --> 02:21:25.710]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.

[02:24:44.645 --> 02:24:47.746]  But before that, I want to play this NBC news clip.
[02:24:47.746 --> 02:24:51.567]  One of the few mainstream news clips to actually report on the subject.
[02:24:51.567 --> 02:24:52.988]  So let's bring it up!
[02:24:54.245 --> 02:24:55.866]  ...Mountains has a real mystery on its hands.
[02:24:55.866 --> 02:25:03.650]  The official explanation here is that jet contrails are causing strange lines in the sky, and that it's pollen making people sick on the ground.
[02:25:03.650 --> 02:25:12.675]  But others are convinced it is something else, and they ask, is the government experimenting with our weather?
[02:25:12.675 --> 02:25:15.536]  There was a huge dust cloud.
[02:25:15.536 --> 02:25:20.039]  Longtime Cedar Glen resident Gretchen Sherman says she has never seen anything like it.
[02:25:21.727 --> 02:25:24.928]  Oh, it covered the entire Cedar Glen area.
[02:25:24.928 --> 02:25:29.210]  A cloud of dust, leaving a sticky yellow slime all over her car.
[02:25:29.210 --> 02:25:33.772]  It happened again last February, and calls began pouring into the local Alpenhorn newspaper.
[02:25:33.772 --> 02:25:39.795]  And they had a tremendous upsurge of children that were not going to school at that time.
[02:25:39.795 --> 02:25:44.998]  Pharmacist Ed Burrows says it is the most mysterious illness he's seen in 22 years on the mountain.
[02:25:44.998 --> 02:25:47.939]  A lot of eye infection problems, upper respiratory problems.
[02:25:48.696 --> 02:25:49.877]  Uh, nosebleeds.
[02:25:49.877 --> 02:25:52.960]  The nearby March Air Force Base say it didn't come from them.
[02:25:52.960 --> 02:25:55.442]  Others said it was a pollen cloud.
[02:25:55.442 --> 02:25:59.645]  The Department of Health found a yellowish tint on a tissue submitted for testing.
[02:25:59.645 --> 02:26:06.290]  But, quote, there was no sign of any biological form, such as cedar pollen, and the test was ruled inconclusive.
[02:26:06.290 --> 02:26:09.973]  And it wasn't long before things ballooned into a sky-high mystery.
[02:26:09.973 --> 02:26:13.176]  The story is not just here in Crestline and the alleged yellow cloud.
[02:26:13.689 --> 02:26:22.701]  People say the government is up there, in airplanes, spraying all kinds of chemicals to change or manipulate the weather, leaving what you see there, and they call that a chemtrail.
[02:26:22.701 --> 02:26:26.506]  So, what I look at there, and I think are contrails, you're telling me are chemtrails?
[02:26:26.506 --> 02:26:28.809]  Yes, that a contrail would be dissipated by now.
[02:26:28.809 --> 02:26:29.250]  It would?
[02:26:29.250 --> 02:26:29.751]  Yes, it would.
[02:26:30.535 --> 02:26:31.735]  Chemtrails.
[02:26:31.735 --> 02:26:37.017]  On the internet, they are cited as proof of the government creating clouds to combat global warming.
[02:26:37.017 --> 02:26:41.259]  In response, the Air Force says that, quote, there is no such thing as a chemtrail.
[02:26:41.259 --> 02:26:44.800]  The actual contrails are a safe and natural phenomenon.
[02:26:44.800 --> 02:26:51.863]  And that people are seeing more contrails simply because there are more jets forming large clouds, depending on weather conditions.
[02:26:51.863 --> 02:26:55.644]  As in this video of alleged chemtrails shot near San Francisco.
[02:26:55.644 --> 02:26:56.825]  I think these are contrails.
[02:26:57.631 --> 02:27:02.635]  Professor Gregory Benford of UC Irvine works with the Department of Energy on weather research.
[02:27:02.635 --> 02:27:03.775]  That's very odd.
[02:27:03.775 --> 02:27:06.277]  They could be very large contrails.
[02:27:06.277 --> 02:27:10.400]  He says the DOE doesn't know of any jet spraying chemicals to affect the weather.
[02:27:10.400 --> 02:27:13.662]  However, he says, we will probably see it in the near future.
[02:27:13.662 --> 02:27:18.526]  You've got to, in a sense, engineer all these, so you get the right kind of clouds for the effects we want.
[02:27:19.395 --> 02:27:27.901]  It is called geoengineering, fighting global warming by putting a chemical dust in the atmosphere and reflecting harmful radiation back into space.
[02:27:27.901 --> 02:27:32.864]  You could use barium oxide, for example, which makes big fluffy clouds.
[02:27:32.864 --> 02:27:38.208]  You could use tiny little bits of aluminum, which is benign in the environment, and essentially manage the climate.
[02:27:38.208 --> 02:27:45.053]  And what I found was unusual spiking since the early 1990s in barium, aluminum,
[02:27:45.928 --> 02:28:00.387]  But Roslyn Peterson of California Skywatch says Health Department records show a sharp increase in both chemicals in the water supply of Northern California, dating from the time the huge contrails first appeared over her home in Mendocino County.
[02:28:00.387 --> 02:28:02.249]  What's the significance of the barium and the aluminum?
[02:28:02.842 --> 02:28:09.007]  I went and got all the tests, and all these things in the same test would be up way over state and federal standards.
[02:28:09.007 --> 02:28:14.311]  This had to be airborne, because how could it get to such diverse regions of our county?
[02:28:14.311 --> 02:28:16.433]  We have jets going in every direction.
[02:28:16.433 --> 02:28:19.536]  X's, east, west, north, south, circles.
[02:28:19.536 --> 02:28:21.017]  There is something going on in the air.
[02:28:21.017 --> 02:28:24.299]  I don't know exactly what, but I think there's some experimentation.
[02:28:24.299 --> 02:28:25.580]  Is it legal?
[02:28:25.580 --> 02:28:28.623]  I don't know, because we haven't had a public discussion.
[02:28:29.272 --> 02:28:34.656]  But what is unknown today may be actual fact tomorrow, thanks to a bill soon to be voted on in the U.S.
[02:28:34.656 --> 02:28:35.076]  Senate.
[02:28:35.076 --> 02:28:45.364]  A Weather Modification Act calling for research in, quote, attempting to change or control by artificial methods the natural development of atmospheric cloud forms.
[02:28:45.364 --> 02:28:48.386]  Doesn't it seem to you that they're going to be doing it in the future for sure?
[02:28:48.386 --> 02:28:49.687]  Yes.
[02:28:49.687 --> 02:28:51.949]  And if they are, I want to know about it.
[02:28:51.949 --> 02:28:56.032]  In the meantime, a lot of people are wondering if they'll ever get clear skies.
[02:28:56.910 --> 02:28:58.390]  And a clear answer.
[02:28:58.390 --> 02:29:01.751]  The legislation is there, therefore somebody's thinking about this.
[02:29:01.751 --> 02:29:03.252]  How does this make sense?
[02:29:03.252 --> 02:29:05.252]  I don't know, maybe they're practicing?
[02:29:05.252 --> 02:29:06.093]  Over Cedar Glen.
[02:29:06.093 --> 02:29:07.233]  Over Arrowhead.
[02:29:07.233 --> 02:29:09.353]  I guess you have to try it out before you use it.
[02:29:09.353 --> 02:29:13.675]  I'm not sure.
[02:29:13.675 --> 02:29:18.336]  Alright, we're going to be back with Rosalind Peterson that was in this news clip.
[02:29:18.336 --> 02:29:21.177]  Again, they just do it and then they announce they're going to do it later.
[02:29:21.177 --> 02:29:22.557]  But it's already in place.
[02:29:22.557 --> 02:29:24.738]  The Alex Jones Show will be back after this.
[02:29:24.738 --> 02:29:25.698]  Infowars.com.
[02:29:38.516 --> 02:29:42.439]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:42.439 --> 02:29:45.120]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:48.191 --> 02:29:50.152]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:29:50.152 --> 02:29:53.774]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:29:53.774 --> 02:29:56.215]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:29:56.215 --> 02:29:59.256]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:29:59.256 --> 02:30:04.999]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:30:04.999 --> 02:30:08.901]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[02:32:37.728 --> 02:32:39.569]  Cardivine Circulation for Life!
[02:32:39.569 --> 02:32:41.330]  Alright folks, we're back!
[02:33:02.654 --> 02:33:03.575]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:03.575 --> 02:33:04.636]  I'm Jason Bermas, sitting in.
[02:33:04.636 --> 02:33:08.901]  We're with Rosalind Peterson of CaliforniaSkyWatch.com.
[02:33:08.901 --> 02:33:15.529]  And I've seen just such a promotion of these chemtrails, comtrails, whatever you want to talk, even in little kids programming.
[02:33:15.529 --> 02:33:19.194]  There was a film that came out, animated film, that came out a couple years ago called Over the Hedge.
[02:33:19.654 --> 02:33:21.536]  And these things are all over the place.
[02:33:21.536 --> 02:33:23.878]  I mean, they're literally being put up in the background.
[02:33:23.878 --> 02:33:29.804]  There's one scene where the animals are shot all the way up in the air, and you can see the chemtrails behind them.
[02:33:29.804 --> 02:33:33.227]  It really feels like we're being prepped for something bigger.
[02:33:33.227 --> 02:33:40.995]  I'm just wondering, what can the average person do, Rosalind, to get this information out, to try to get the truth about what these things are?
[02:33:42.509 --> 02:33:57.320]  Well, first of all, it comes down to a bit of education and looking at some of the documents that are online, and there are a lot of them, and beginning to bring these issues about their concerns to their elected officials.
[02:33:57.320 --> 02:34:09.729]  And I think that the more pressure we put on our elected officials, the more we go to meetings, the more we look at our water test results in different states and begin to complain about them being way over state and federal standards.
[02:34:10.595 --> 02:34:19.920]  I think that the more we take the tests and I think that local action is absolutely necessary at the ground level to get the attention.
[02:34:19.920 --> 02:34:32.768]  And we have to get the media to take a look and not just be bulldozed over by the Air Force who says it's a hoax, but to really get them to do some independent research and really look up.
[02:34:32.768 --> 02:34:34.348]  And I think that they don't look up.
[02:34:34.348 --> 02:34:37.310]  I think that they want to take someone's word for it sometimes.
[02:34:37.310 --> 02:34:38.771]  I think they want to put their heads in the sand.
[02:34:39.090 --> 02:34:42.872]  But we have some callers that are on topic on the chemtrail issue.
[02:34:42.872 --> 02:34:44.914]  Let's go to Ron in Texas.
[02:34:44.914 --> 02:34:46.815]  Ron, are you with us?
[02:34:46.815 --> 02:34:47.275]  Hey, Jason.
[02:34:47.275 --> 02:34:48.496]  Appreciate you taking my call.
[02:34:48.496 --> 02:34:53.719]  I just want to bring up one real obvious point, being a professional pilot.
[02:34:53.719 --> 02:35:01.984]  There's been some government spew out about the fact that they even added something to the fuel that would cause it to burn more efficiently, etc.
[02:35:01.984 --> 02:35:04.806]  And it was part of the cause of leaving these trails.
[02:35:04.806 --> 02:35:07.067]  Well, there's a very obvious thing in aviation
[02:35:07.540 --> 02:35:09.982]  That everybody seems to miss on this point.
[02:35:09.982 --> 02:35:13.525]  And that's that aviation does not want clouded skies.
[02:35:13.525 --> 02:35:16.607]  The clearer the skies are, the better it is for aviation.
[02:35:16.607 --> 02:35:22.011]  When they put this stuff up there, it's actually endangering the safety of aviation.
[02:35:22.011 --> 02:35:24.113]  And I'll let it go from there and talk at you later.
[02:35:24.113 --> 02:35:25.494]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[02:35:25.494 --> 02:35:30.978]  Um, what do you think, uh, Rosalind, do you think this does hurt, uh, you know, people who are trying to fly planes?
[02:35:30.978 --> 02:35:32.239]  Um, yes I do.
[02:35:32.239 --> 02:35:33.480]  Yes I do.
[02:35:33.480 --> 02:35:37.223]  And I also think that not only does it cut down on visibility,
[02:35:37.816 --> 02:35:53.742]  But when I flew back last year to the United Nations to speak there on the subject as an invited guest for the Climate Change Conference, what I found was, going over, that we couldn't see the ground.
[02:35:53.742 --> 02:35:59.364]  It was always covered with white haze, jet contrails.
[02:35:59.364 --> 02:36:05.706]  It was just fascinating to look out the window and realize that we couldn't see the ground except in a haze.
[02:36:05.706 --> 02:36:07.047]  It wasn't clear anywhere.
[02:36:08.053 --> 02:36:14.457]  And this was all the way across the United States from San Francisco, clear to New York City.
[02:36:14.457 --> 02:36:22.722]  And what we were seeing was something that I never saw when I was flying in the 1970s back east from California.
[02:36:22.722 --> 02:36:30.247]  It used to be beautiful, sparkling, you could look down, you could see the ground, and it was just clear.
[02:36:30.247 --> 02:36:32.768]  And now that's not the case.
[02:36:32.768 --> 02:36:33.609]  Plus the fact
[02:36:34.212 --> 02:36:38.554]  That we're getting all these particulates and different things going on.
[02:36:38.554 --> 02:36:58.504]  I also wish to state that there has been some question about something being put into the jet fuel itself, but aluminum in the fuel could wreck a jet engine, so I don't believe that they're actually putting it in the jet fuel itself, and I've never thought that.
[02:36:58.504 --> 02:37:03.087]  I think that they could have additives afterwards, or
[02:37:03.891 --> 02:37:11.677]  There is what they call one of these MAF, M-A-F-F, and the U.S.
[02:37:11.677 --> 02:37:17.982]  Air Force C-130 Modular Aerial Spray System.
[02:37:17.982 --> 02:37:26.328]  And this spray system is designed to perform aerial applications for chemicals.
[02:37:26.328 --> 02:37:31.252]  And the module loads and mixes and
[02:37:33.299 --> 02:37:41.645]  It has attachments that can be attached to these C-130s so that they can do spraying operations.
[02:37:41.645 --> 02:37:42.766]  And this was on a U.S.
[02:37:42.766 --> 02:37:45.108]  Air Force website.
[02:37:45.108 --> 02:37:52.013]  And they have ultra low volume wing booms for applications.
[02:37:52.013 --> 02:38:01.481]  They have low volume and then they have high volume where they can really put out a lot of chemical.
[02:38:02.398 --> 02:38:11.224]  And so they talk about this mass system, and if anyone wants to do a little research, they can go to the Lockheed Conair.
[02:38:11.224 --> 02:38:13.986]  This is who built the system.
[02:38:13.986 --> 02:38:21.771]  And what it does is it allows for chemicals to be sprayed by these huge Air Force jets.
[02:38:21.771 --> 02:38:24.273]  Well, Lockheed Martin could only have our best interest at heart.
[02:38:24.273 --> 02:38:27.075]  I mean, Lockheed Martin is such a good, good, you know, corporation.
[02:38:27.075 --> 02:38:28.836]  I mean, I'm sure that they're doing it for our own good.
[02:38:29.642 --> 02:38:32.183]  Well, I think that Lockheed Martin got paid to do it.
[02:38:32.183 --> 02:38:34.283]  In other words, they were contracted by the U.S.
[02:38:34.283 --> 02:38:37.344]  government, and that's how all of these things get built.
[02:38:37.344 --> 02:38:48.626]  Sure, I mean, it's plausible deniability on one end, and they just use one of their military-industrial-complex companies to actually do the dirty work, so if anything ever comes out, they can say, oh, well, we didn't really know it was going to be poison.
[02:38:48.626 --> 02:38:51.626]  We thought it was all going to be positive, and they'll shift the blame to them.
[02:38:51.626 --> 02:38:53.107]  Let's take another caller on topic.
[02:38:53.107 --> 02:38:55.327]  Let's go to Kathy in Canada.
[02:38:55.327 --> 02:38:57.208]  Kathy, are you there?
[02:38:57.208 --> 02:38:57.888]  Yeah, hi.
[02:38:57.888 --> 02:38:59.288]  Rosalind, you're doing a great job here.
[02:39:00.368 --> 02:39:01.589]  Well, thank you.
[02:39:01.589 --> 02:39:04.490]  It's hard to pick a topic, but I guess I have to.
[02:39:04.490 --> 02:39:12.875]  I've spent the last four years researching the effects of heavy metals when we get them into our bodies, and especially into, like, our animals.
[02:39:12.875 --> 02:39:15.176]  And I met a gentleman a few years back.
[02:39:15.176 --> 02:39:20.259]  His name was Mark Purdy from England, and he's passed away now from a brain tumor.
[02:39:20.259 --> 02:39:28.603]  But what he discovered was that with the BSE mad cow disease and chronic wasting diseases, these animals are
[02:39:29.222 --> 02:39:32.004]  have been exposed to these metals.
[02:39:32.004 --> 02:39:33.285]  And it's very similar.
[02:39:33.285 --> 02:39:43.171]  He's got 14 peer-reviewed studies, and he discusses how they've been exposed to barium, strontium, cesium, manganese, and all these various things.
[02:39:43.171 --> 02:39:50.496]  And their diet was deficient in the necessary trace minerals, like copper and zinc and selenium.
[02:39:50.496 --> 02:39:54.179]  And what I'm very concerned about is, I think his work is magnificent.
[02:39:54.179 --> 02:39:56.841]  And he has a website, www.markpurdy.com.
[02:39:58.035 --> 02:40:03.038]  And he also has a book that was published last year called Animal Farm.
[02:40:03.038 --> 02:40:05.140]  Farm is spelled P-H-A-R-M.
[02:40:05.140 --> 02:40:07.561]  I encourage people to read it.
[02:40:07.561 --> 02:40:13.185]  The science that he was projecting out there is very much involved with things like viruses as well.
[02:40:13.185 --> 02:40:15.266]  Because viruses are not living.
[02:40:15.266 --> 02:40:21.310]  Viruses are DNA and RNA which is nucleated on a metal particle.
[02:40:21.310 --> 02:40:22.291]  Hello?
[02:40:22.291 --> 02:40:23.571]  Yes, we're here.
[02:40:23.571 --> 02:40:27.134]  Yeah, and the more I look into viruses, I realize that
[02:40:28.383 --> 02:40:34.707]  The effect of proteins by metals is what's causing them to misfold.
[02:40:34.707 --> 02:40:39.711]  And when certain metals attach to these proteins, it's a reversible misfolding.
[02:40:39.711 --> 02:40:54.420]  But when these metals like barium and lead and uranium, like depleted uranium, something I'm heavily into, are involved, they're causing proteins that attach to them to become unable to reverse and fall off of them.
[02:40:54.420 --> 02:40:55.821]  And so I do wonder if this
[02:40:57.383 --> 02:41:00.305]  I mean, I know it's probably involved with HAARP.
[02:41:00.305 --> 02:41:06.909]  It's probably involved with many forms of radar systems to try and allow them to work more efficiently.
[02:41:06.909 --> 02:41:08.190]  Weather control.
[02:41:08.190 --> 02:41:14.275]  But I see these same metal particles being used by the vaccine companies.
[02:41:14.275 --> 02:41:18.217]  Gardasil, for example, has huge amounts of aluminum in it.
[02:41:18.217 --> 02:41:20.779]  The hepatitis B has mercury, I'm told, in it.
[02:41:20.779 --> 02:41:22.380]  Thimerosal, yep.
[02:41:22.380 --> 02:41:23.281]  Yeah, and we're seeing
[02:41:25.103 --> 02:41:29.772]  How in Alberta here where I'm from, our government just announced that they're going to pay for the Gardasil vaccine.
[02:41:30.285 --> 02:41:37.792]  They're injecting this aluminum into your body and they say, oh yeah, by the way, we're going to give it at the same time as the hepatitis shot, which is a mercury shot.
[02:41:37.792 --> 02:41:41.615]  Well, they always say that these are negligible amounts, but obviously it's poison.
[02:41:41.615 --> 02:41:43.657]  I thank you for the call.
[02:41:43.657 --> 02:41:45.899]  They always say, you know, it's for your own good.
[02:41:45.899 --> 02:41:46.919]  It's negligible.
[02:41:46.919 --> 02:41:51.503]  It's not going to have an effect, but we all know that heavy metals aren't good for the body.
[02:41:51.503 --> 02:41:54.586]  And you do have a section on your website about HAARP.
[02:41:54.586 --> 02:41:57.989]  For those who don't know what HAARP is, why don't you give a little overview, Rosalyn?
[02:41:59.903 --> 02:42:07.670]  HAARP is located in Alaska and it's an Air Force Navy project originally.
[02:42:07.670 --> 02:42:24.825]  The Navy is heavily involved in this program and what it does is it's involved with a group of these what they call super heaters and they can heat the atmosphere above us to extremely high temperatures and they use it as an experimental project but
[02:42:26.161 --> 02:42:32.183]  There is some evidence that they can use it for weather modification as well.
[02:42:32.183 --> 02:42:42.627]  My concern is that they're using it to do atmospheric experiments, and some of them NASA is doing at this time.
[02:42:42.627 --> 02:42:48.469]  And what they do is they send these canisters loaded with aluminum and barium, strontium,
[02:42:55.970 --> 02:43:21.763]  Sulfur fluoride, there's a whole group of chemicals that are highly toxic and what they do is they send them up in these canisters either on the space shuttle or they send them up on rockets and when they get these canisters up at certain locations in the ionosphere or at different levels in the atmosphere they superheat them and sometimes they're using the HAARP methodology to actually heat these containers.
[02:43:22.574 --> 02:43:23.214]  The U.S.
[02:43:23.214 --> 02:43:28.457]  Air Force is quite specific and NASA is quite specific in some of their descriptions.
[02:43:28.457 --> 02:43:41.603]  But also, these chemical reactions can have harmful effects on our ionosphere above us and on the cocoon that protects us from UV radiation and other things.
[02:43:41.603 --> 02:43:50.807]  And, I believe from the testing results I've seen in California and water test results, that some of these chemicals are coming down and landing in our drinking water supplies.
[02:43:51.724 --> 02:44:01.107]  So if they're finding them in California drinking water supply tests, that means that they're getting into lakes, rivers, streams, wells, everywhere.
[02:44:01.107 --> 02:44:14.992]  And when you see these huge spikes all across California and in other states, you begin to understand the implication that the chemicals that are going up are coming down and they're having human health effects.
[02:44:14.992 --> 02:44:18.793]  And see, one issue that was just brought up was that
[02:44:19.677 --> 02:44:26.000]  If you filter your drinking water so heavily, you can take out beneficial nutrients.
[02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:31.242]  And this is another cause for concern is if you purify the water too much.
[02:44:31.242 --> 02:44:39.726]  However, on the other hand, I don't think that some water treatment systems will take out these harmful chemicals.
[02:44:39.726 --> 02:44:46.829]  And in addition, many water sources that where the water goes to agriculture are not treated at all.
[02:44:46.829 --> 02:44:48.270]  They go in as raw.
[02:44:49.285 --> 02:44:50.605]  Very interesting stuff.
[02:44:50.605 --> 02:44:52.086]  Let's jump to another caller.
[02:44:52.086 --> 02:44:53.326]  Let's go to Rob in Toronto.
[02:44:53.326 --> 02:44:54.747]  Rob, are you with us?
[02:44:54.747 --> 02:44:55.247]  I am.
[02:44:55.247 --> 02:44:56.747]  Hey, how's it going?
[02:44:56.747 --> 02:44:58.047]  Good, man.
[02:44:58.047 --> 02:44:59.928]  What's on your mind?
[02:45:16.478 --> 02:45:25.545]  I just noticed this article on the Prison Planet Forum actually yesterday and it's basically an admission by the Russian Air Force that they're seeding clouds here.
[02:45:25.545 --> 02:45:29.808]  Well that's the one, hold on, let me read, let me go over that article.
[02:45:29.808 --> 02:45:30.949]  Someone sent me that.
[02:45:30.949 --> 02:45:38.694]  Basically what happened is a bag of cement got loose in the bag while they were seeding the clouds and it crushed the roof of some guy's home.
[02:45:38.694 --> 02:45:42.417]  So they had to admit that they were actually seeding clouds out in Russia, correct?
[02:45:42.975 --> 02:45:43.576]  Right, right.
[02:45:43.576 --> 02:45:49.663]  It says, you know, seeding clouds to prevent rain from spoiling a holiday, Russian media said on Tuesday.
[02:45:49.663 --> 02:45:54.009]  Like, if they can prevent rain from spoiling a holiday, can they not prevent rain from
[02:45:54.588 --> 02:45:58.011]  feeding the crops, and this has major implications.
[02:45:58.011 --> 02:46:15.125]  Sure, but Alex has had Dennis Cuddy on the program a couple years ago, and he was one of the fathers of weather warfare, and he was talking about this type of thing that they were using in Vietnam to create, you know, rain in dense areas where the Vietnamese were, you know, using it as a warfare tool.
[02:46:15.125 --> 02:46:21.850]  So, yeah, I mean, I think that there is absolutely no doubt that there is documented cases of weather modification.
[02:46:21.850 --> 02:46:22.671]  What do you think, Rosalind?
[02:46:23.599 --> 02:46:24.359]  Oh, U.S.
[02:46:24.359 --> 02:46:31.180]  history is loaded with weather modification programs and experiments going back to the 1940s.
[02:46:31.180 --> 02:46:43.223]  And I think by the time of the Vietnam War, they had perfected weather modification and used it over the Ho Chi Minh Trail for many years successfully in Vietnam.
[02:46:43.223 --> 02:46:48.604]  And then since that time, there's no doubt that they've had hurricane control programs.
[02:46:48.604 --> 02:46:50.164]  If you type in
[02:46:51.111 --> 02:46:53.373]  Um, history of weather modification.
[02:46:53.373 --> 02:46:57.216]  You will just come up with an enormous amount of programs.
[02:46:57.216 --> 02:47:00.578]  Some successful, some highly unsuccessful.
[02:47:00.578 --> 02:47:12.767]  And even NASA admits today, I know, admits that there's over 50 to 100 weather modification programs ongoing around the world with other countries like China experimenting.
[02:47:12.767 --> 02:47:20.073]  Um, so we know that, we know that weather modification is working even though there's claims that it doesn't.
[02:47:20.805 --> 02:47:36.212]  Because just in 2005, Wyoming put more snow in the Wyoming mountains than ever before in recorded history from their weather modification program.
[02:47:36.212 --> 02:47:41.754]  And they did that in order to give Southern California more water.
[02:47:41.754 --> 02:47:46.476]  But it backfired and the snow melted too fast and they got some flooding.
[02:47:47.113 --> 02:48:03.300]  But that program subsequently, since that time every year, has put surrounding counties in Wyoming in drought conditions and has put Colorado, I believe, due to the size of the number of square miles involved in the program, into drought conditions.
[02:48:03.300 --> 02:48:11.504]  So what happens is that, for example, this year, according to NOAA's programs, I think I sent you a list of those.
[02:48:12.228 --> 02:48:19.091]  But there was one that was modifying 184,000 square miles.
[02:48:19.091 --> 02:48:39.399]  Well, if you put water or snow in one location, you're going to subtract it from where it would go normally, disrupting agricultural microclimates, putting some parts of the country like Oklahoma in drought, and then you could flood out other areas that weren't supposed to get so much rain.
[02:48:40.251 --> 02:48:59.564]  No one, with all these weather problems ongoing across the United States, is taking a look at if they're still conducting their weather modification programs while people are engaged in fighting off too much rain.
[02:48:59.564 --> 02:49:05.528]  So, modifying the weather can have very adverse effects, and no one is looking.
[02:49:05.528 --> 02:49:09.391]  See, right now, I can pay someone, a weather modification company,
[02:49:09.898 --> 02:49:16.782]  To go and say, I want to modify the weather over New York City, for example.
[02:49:16.782 --> 02:49:20.944]  And I can hire a company and they'll go in and they'll do what I want.
[02:49:20.944 --> 02:49:29.108]  They can dissipate fog, they can make it rain, they can make it snow, anything I want, as long as I have the money to pay them.
[02:49:29.108 --> 02:49:31.950]  And here's the clinker.
[02:49:31.950 --> 02:49:37.253]  Not one government agency has oversight over what I'm doing.
[02:49:37.253 --> 02:49:39.134]  I don't have to notify the public.
[02:49:40.172 --> 02:49:42.934]  And I don't, there's nothing I have to do.
[02:49:42.934 --> 02:49:46.517]  I can just go and pay to have it done.
[02:49:46.517 --> 02:49:52.242]  So universities can do studies and experiments, private companies.
[02:49:52.242 --> 02:50:07.934]  The Dynamat Corporation right now is the, Cordani is the owner and he's outfitted a plane and he's out pouring one of the chemicals that he, that's toxic by the way, that he
[02:50:10.684 --> 02:50:14.347]  That is used by his company to mop up spills.
[02:50:14.347 --> 02:50:21.393]  If a chemical liquid spills on the ground, you put this chemical powder on it and it absorbs it.
[02:50:21.393 --> 02:50:23.134]  He's modifying our weather.
[02:50:23.134 --> 02:50:27.498]  Yeah, it's amazing that this is in private hands and they can do anything they'd like with it.
[02:50:27.498 --> 02:50:30.721]  We have Rosalind Peterson of California Skywatch on the program.
[02:50:30.721 --> 02:50:31.782]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:50:31.782 --> 02:50:32.983]  I'm Jason Bermas.
[02:50:32.983 --> 02:50:34.324]  We'll be back after this with your calls.
[02:50:49.897 --> 02:50:55.982]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[02:50:55.982 --> 02:51:01.927]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high-stress lifestyles.
[02:51:01.927 --> 02:51:06.091]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[02:51:06.091 --> 02:51:10.995]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[02:51:11.235 --> 02:51:19.737]  At SnyderHealth.com we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science, the leader in water ionization technology for over 25 years.

[02:51:48.890 --> 02:51:50.311]  It is a big idea.
[02:51:50.311 --> 02:51:53.133]  A new world order.
[02:51:53.133 --> 02:51:57.396]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:51:58.021 --> 02:52:00.844]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:52:00.844 --> 02:52:03.628]  Put their objective to be world domination.
[02:52:03.628 --> 02:52:06.811]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:52:06.811 --> 02:52:14.140]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:52:17.168 --> 02:52:22.612]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:52:22.612 --> 02:52:26.474]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:52:26.474 --> 02:52:29.036]  Bill Burdick is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:52:29.036 --> 02:52:30.197]  Most people have no idea.
[02:52:30.197 --> 02:52:30.997]  They're not after money.
[02:52:30.997 --> 02:52:32.278]  They have all the money they need.
[02:52:32.278 --> 02:52:33.239]  They're after power.
[02:52:33.239 --> 02:52:34.400]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[02:52:43.145 --> 02:52:45.927]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:52:45.927 --> 02:52:46.968]  You have been warned.
[02:52:48.189 --> 02:52:50.170]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:52:50.170 --> 02:52:57.135]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:52:57.135 --> 02:53:05.541]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:53:05.541 --> 02:53:11.265]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:53:11.445 --> 02:53:13.266]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:53:13.266 --> 02:53:15.466]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:53:15.466 --> 02:53:19.988]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:53:19.988 --> 02:53:22.208]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:53:22.208 --> 02:53:29.951]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[02:53:57.179 --> 02:53:59.099]  All right, folks, we're back at the Alex Jones Show.
[02:53:59.099 --> 02:54:01.580]  I'm Jason Burmas stepping in for the week.
[02:54:01.580 --> 02:54:04.001]  And I just want to remind everybody to support our sponsors.
[02:54:04.001 --> 02:54:07.501]  Without them, this program is not possible.
[02:54:07.501 --> 02:54:08.862]  New Vitality Aloe Ease.
[02:54:08.862 --> 02:54:14.543]  With all the junk we eat, it's important that we do our very best to take care of our digestive systems.
[02:54:14.543 --> 02:54:17.884]  New Vitality, one of our great sponsors, has a product called Aloe Ease.
[02:54:17.884 --> 02:54:24.325]  Aloe Ease is an herbal dietary supplement developed to support healthy digestive function and even helps maintain weight loss.
[02:54:25.035 --> 02:54:30.398]  Aloe is all natural ingredients, nutritionally support regularity and assist your body in removing acclimated waste.
[02:54:30.398 --> 02:54:36.562]  It contains 30 synergistically balanced natural herbs and enzyme that work together to improve overall health.
[02:54:36.562 --> 02:54:41.645]  Do yourself a favor and click on the big banner over at InfoWars.com or you can call them at 1-800-569-4056.
[02:54:41.645 --> 02:54:41.905]  That's 1-800-569-4056.
[02:54:41.905 --> 02:54:46.388]  And we have Rosalind Peterson of CaliforniaSkyWatch.com on with us, really schooling us
[02:54:54.853 --> 02:54:59.495]  Can you give me a list of just the names of the best experts on it and also go through the compounds that are being sprayed?
[02:55:23.326 --> 02:55:38.913]  And I just want to also say that when you contacted your senator and you put that request for information, that is essentially the problem, is that we're allowing ourselves to be lied to.
[02:55:38.913 --> 02:55:45.655]  For them to treat you like a child in those letters is just atrocious.
[02:55:45.655 --> 02:55:50.057]  Then you give me who are the best authors, Cliff Carnicon,
[02:55:52.185 --> 02:55:54.127]  Some of the other people that have been on this show.
[02:55:54.127 --> 02:55:55.428]  All right, let's ask her.
[02:55:55.428 --> 02:55:58.890]  Rosalyn, who do you think the best authors are on this subject?
[02:55:58.890 --> 02:56:04.775]  Well, there's a number of them that have written books on the subject.
[02:56:04.775 --> 02:56:10.920]  And if you just Google a link for books on the subject, they will come right up for you.
[02:56:10.920 --> 02:56:17.885]  What I would say is some good websites to go look at are ArizonaSkyWatch.com.
[02:56:17.885 --> 02:56:20.027]  Bridget Conroy has been researching this since 1999.
[02:56:21.969 --> 02:56:34.439]  And she's especially interested in the health effects for families and children and what's going on with our skies and is a dedicated researcher on this subject and she would be very helpful.
[02:56:34.439 --> 02:56:38.082]  My website contains a lot of information.
[02:56:38.082 --> 02:56:45.768]  There's a lot of books on weather warfare that talk about, in other words, different types of programs.
[02:56:45.768 --> 02:56:49.831]  But I would say your government documents are a good place to start because
[02:56:50.458 --> 02:56:59.325]  There's so much information online, and I can say that I'm going to put up a new website.
[02:56:59.325 --> 02:57:09.994]  It's not up yet, but it's going to be called the Agricultural Defense Coalition, and this is going to contain approximately 8,000 documents.
[02:57:09.994 --> 02:57:16.720]  All my database is right now being put on this website, and I'm hoping to have it up before the end of the month for sure.
[02:57:17.581 --> 02:57:21.962]  And so it's a monumental project to put everything I have.
[02:57:21.962 --> 02:57:29.564]  But there's a lot of documents right now on California Skywatch and on Arizona Skywatch.com.
[02:57:29.564 --> 02:57:38.586]  So I encourage you all to do the research and check in and look at these websites from the government, NOAA, NASA.
[02:57:38.586 --> 02:57:44.188]  Lots of programs there that they talk about and this would be a good research.
[02:57:45.075 --> 02:57:47.677]  I know that there's a variety of weather modification chemicals
[02:58:14.676 --> 02:58:17.977]  that they're using in atmospheric programs.
[02:58:17.977 --> 02:58:29.741]  I can tell you that the canisters that are sent up by NASA contain barium, aluminum, strontium, manganese, magnesium, calcium, lithium.
[02:58:29.741 --> 02:58:30.781]  Oh, we're off the air.
[02:58:30.781 --> 02:58:33.142]  Rosalyn, can you hang on for one more segment?
[02:58:38.655 --> 02:58:41.517]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[02:58:41.517 --> 02:58:43.078]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[02:58:43.078 --> 02:58:45.219]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:58:45.219 --> 02:58:47.120]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[02:58:47.120 --> 02:58:48.621]  The late great USA.
[02:58:48.621 --> 02:58:50.382]  America, freedom to fascism.
[02:58:50.382 --> 02:58:57.406]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[02:59:52.702 --> 02:59:54.463]  Government cover-ups.
[02:59:54.463 --> 02:59:56.044]  You want answers?
[02:59:56.044 --> 02:59:57.585]  Well, so does he.
[02:59:57.585 --> 03:00:01.787]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:01.787 --> 03:00:06.229]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:06.229 --> 03:00:08.711]  Not Alex Jones, Jason Bermas.
[03:00:08.711 --> 03:00:09.831]  I'll be in for the rest of the week.
[03:00:09.831 --> 03:00:14.474]  Alex will be returning for his Sunday program, taking a much-needed break with his family.
[03:00:14.474 --> 03:00:18.796]  And right now we have Rosalind Peterson with us for this final hour on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:00:22.546 --> 03:00:25.367]  And she was just listing off some compounds.
[03:00:25.367 --> 03:00:30.109]  Again, not in every Comtrail or Chemtrail, but what's been found in them.
[03:00:30.109 --> 03:00:33.490]  And we have just a ton more callers, so let's just shoot through them.
[03:00:33.490 --> 03:00:34.451]  Let's get through their questions.
[03:00:34.451 --> 03:00:35.731]  Let's go to Chris in Texas.
[03:00:35.731 --> 03:00:38.592]  Chris, are you there?
[03:00:38.592 --> 03:00:40.693]  Are you with us, Chris?
[03:00:40.693 --> 03:00:42.314]  Are we losing him?
[03:00:42.314 --> 03:00:45.255]  Alright, let's try Chris in Iowa then.
[03:00:45.255 --> 03:00:46.676]  Chris, you with us?
[03:00:46.676 --> 03:00:48.176]  Yes, I'm here.
[03:00:48.176 --> 03:00:49.637]  Let me get off my speakerphone.
[03:00:49.637 --> 03:00:49.957]  Alright.
[03:00:52.270 --> 03:00:54.151]  Alright, what's your question, Chris?
[03:00:54.151 --> 03:01:03.256]  Well, I wanted to talk about using the contrails term to describe these.
[03:01:03.256 --> 03:01:09.039]  I think they should be more like, more called aerosolized particle scattering.
[03:01:09.039 --> 03:01:15.142]  If you go and Google that, I know Jones can never remember that when he's on air.
[03:01:15.142 --> 03:01:18.724]  And there's a semi-direct, indirect, and direct.
[03:01:20.854 --> 03:01:37.377]  Entire campaigns on it that I found like, like one time I found like 5,000 separate, uh, either websites or, um, uh, college studies, people writing whole paperwork, whole dissertations on, uh, on doing this.
[03:01:37.377 --> 03:01:45.299]  And I just found another one just while I was waiting by the Aerospace Corporation.
[03:01:45.299 --> 03:01:47.599]  I found a whole, like a, uh,
[03:01:48.160 --> 03:01:50.562]  A big presentation on all the stuff they've been doing.
[03:01:50.562 --> 03:01:56.267]  The particle size, the effective variance, aerosol, single scattering.
[03:01:56.267 --> 03:02:00.971]  It's... I mean, saying it doesn't exist is like saying the sun doesn't come up.
[03:02:00.971 --> 03:02:06.856]  Well, I mean, again, they just say it doesn't exist even though it's clear in the skies and you would call it aerosolized particle matter?
[03:02:06.856 --> 03:02:08.597]  Particle scattering.
[03:02:08.597 --> 03:02:09.938]  Particle scatter.
[03:02:09.938 --> 03:02:14.342]  Yeah, that's what they... There's actually classes in about 20 or 30 different colleges.
[03:02:15.978 --> 03:02:17.820]  Well, let's get her opinion on it.
[03:02:17.820 --> 03:02:18.500]  She's the expert.
[03:02:18.500 --> 03:02:21.924]  What do you think of that term, Rosalind?
[03:02:21.924 --> 03:02:37.639]  It's just hard to remember, I think, but I think that a lot of websites are beginning to talk about different things, and you can Google different items on the Internet and come up with documents and studies on those things.
[03:02:38.303 --> 03:02:49.010]  And I do believe that we are engaged full-time in this process, because the jets hardly ever leave our skies alone so that we get deep blue skies.
[03:02:49.010 --> 03:03:01.539]  And I don't believe that commercial airlines are as engaged in this process as everyone wants to think, or our government wants us to think, because they can't afford to do the loops in the loop.
[03:03:01.539 --> 03:03:04.061]  They can't afford to go off in all directions.
[03:03:04.741 --> 03:03:06.622]  Because they have to be on a schedule.
[03:03:06.622 --> 03:03:21.049]  They fly straight lines, they're trying to conserve fuel, they're cutting back, and so I can't believe that airlines have the money to do the loop-the-loop and go through keeping planes up, doing all the things that we see in the skies these days.
[03:03:21.049 --> 03:03:23.670]  So, I'm in total agreement.
[03:03:23.670 --> 03:03:24.611]  Yeah, I'm with you.
[03:03:24.611 --> 03:03:25.491]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:03:25.491 --> 03:03:26.792]  Can I read something?
[03:03:26.792 --> 03:03:33.375]  I'm getting a lot of emails, and would you tell everyone that emails me that I will respond back to them personally?
[03:03:34.059 --> 03:03:38.142]  But I got an email from Mike.
[03:03:38.142 --> 03:03:40.864]  He's in Corpus Christi, Texas.
[03:03:40.864 --> 03:03:48.931]  And he just said to say, Texas, he said, Corpus Christi, Texas, our sky is full of persistent, lingering contrails.
[03:03:48.931 --> 03:03:52.394]  He says, anyone with half a brain can see the effects of this spring.
[03:03:52.394 --> 03:03:55.096]  No rainfall, no crops, no food.
[03:03:55.096 --> 03:03:59.119]  We then become dependent on foreign aid that can't be good for the people of the United States.
[03:03:59.119 --> 03:04:01.421]  He says, thanks for taking the time to read my email.
[03:04:02.085 --> 03:04:06.048]  So, I will respond back to the people that emailed to me.
[03:04:06.048 --> 03:04:07.849]  I just wanted to let you know.
[03:04:07.849 --> 03:04:10.591]  Excellent, excellent, because our listeners will engage.
[03:04:10.591 --> 03:04:14.674]  Let me tell you, I've got tons of emails now that I say I take them too.
[03:04:14.674 --> 03:04:15.935]  Oh man, there's so many of them.
[03:04:15.935 --> 03:04:17.916]  But a lot of these callers bring up great points.
[03:04:17.916 --> 03:04:22.679]  And that's why we're going to go to John in Ohio and Kyle in Iowa after the break.
[03:04:22.679 --> 03:04:24.280]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:04:24.280 --> 03:04:27.343]  We have Rosalind Peterson of CaliforniaSkyWatch.com.
[03:04:28.732 --> 03:04:36.416]  I just want to remind everybody that if you missed any of the previous three hours, it's all going to be replayed at InfoWars.com at the bottom of the hour.
[03:04:36.416 --> 03:04:37.277]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:04:45.626 --> 03:04:58.751]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[03:04:58.751 --> 03:05:02.593]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[03:05:02.933 --> 03:05:09.818]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[03:05:09.818 --> 03:05:13.240]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[03:05:13.240 --> 03:05:21.125]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[03:05:45.370 --> 03:05:48.314]  Hemp, the superfood for you and your family.
[03:05:48.314 --> 03:05:52.078]  Hemp has nutritional values that far exceed any known plant.
[03:05:52.078 --> 03:05:55.862]  Hemp, used for food, clothing, and shelter since time began.
[03:05:55.862 --> 03:06:02.931]  Hemp, this God-given food source is controlled by your government, making it not legal to grow for American people and farmers, but legal to import.
[03:06:03.291 --> 03:06:06.815]  Our Founding Fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.
[03:06:06.815 --> 03:06:11.020]  The protein powder, seeds, and oil are available through hempusa.org.
[03:06:11.020 --> 03:06:15.705]  Recommended daily intake of this food source will allow the body to heal itself from many ailments.
[03:06:15.705 --> 03:06:22.092]  Loaded with potassium, magnesium, calcium, essential fatty acids, amino acids, and nutrients not available in other plants.
[03:06:22.412 --> 03:06:26.934]  Hemp can be stored with a long shelf life as a life-sustaining food source for you and your family.
[03:06:26.934 --> 03:06:29.055]  Could this be the government's best-kept secret?

[03:06:45.714 --> 03:06:48.797]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[03:06:48.797 --> 03:06:54.322]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[03:06:54.322 --> 03:07:00.048]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[03:07:00.048 --> 03:07:01.529]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:07:01.529 --> 03:07:10.438]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[03:07:10.838 --> 03:07:12.680]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[03:07:12.680 --> 03:07:16.885]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[03:07:46.482 --> 03:07:53.084]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:07:53.084 --> 03:07:57.766]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:07:57.766 --> 03:07:59.306]  Alright, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:07:59.306 --> 03:08:00.627]  I'm Jason Burmess subbing in.
[03:08:00.627 --> 03:08:03.508]  You can get at me at MySpace.com slash Jason Burmess.
[03:08:03.508 --> 03:08:10.810]  Check out our website LooseChange911.com or you can go to InfoWarsInPrisonPlanet and there's links to a lot of my stuff over there.
[03:08:11.756 --> 03:08:22.543]  Alex will be back on Sunday, and we're talking to Rosalind Peterson, really the foremost authority on weather modification concerning chemtrails, comtrails, whatever you want to talk, want to call them.
[03:08:22.543 --> 03:08:28.947]  Obviously, the military is denying the existence of chemtrails, so she has stayed away from that term.
[03:08:28.947 --> 03:08:30.107]  But we're going to jump to another caller.
[03:08:30.107 --> 03:08:34.050]  Let's see what John in Ohio has to say about the matter.
[03:08:34.050 --> 03:08:34.870]  Yes, sir.
[03:08:34.870 --> 03:08:35.091]  Yes.
[03:08:35.091 --> 03:08:36.411]  What's up, John?
[03:08:36.411 --> 03:08:40.474]  Well, I'd like to look at it from another standpoint.
[03:08:40.474 --> 03:08:40.634]  Sure.
[03:08:41.067 --> 03:08:50.411]  I'm a ham operator, and when the aluminum coated fiberglass is dropped, it just tears the bands up.
[03:08:50.411 --> 03:08:59.094]  Now, I've spoke to Art Bell about this on the radio, or on the ham, and he agrees with it.
[03:08:59.094 --> 03:09:06.717]  Now, the other point is, when some of the aircraft are coming in that are too heavy to land, and they're dumping their fuel,
[03:09:07.779 --> 03:09:11.881]  They say it evaporates before it hits the ground.
[03:09:11.881 --> 03:09:18.044]  Well, if it's a kerosene base, which is extremely oily, that's a little hard to believe.
[03:09:18.044 --> 03:09:23.606]  All right, let's get, uh, let's get, uh, Rosalind's opinion on those two things.
[03:09:23.606 --> 03:09:25.207]  Rosalind?
[03:09:25.207 --> 03:09:34.971]  Uh, yes, jets do at times, uh, dump their jet fuel before they land, and, uh, people have been, uh, had the fuel dumped on them, so I've, I've seen reports of this.
[03:09:35.643 --> 03:09:38.284]  So I don't know if they evaporate.
[03:09:38.284 --> 03:09:39.724]  I would agree with that.
[03:09:39.724 --> 03:09:45.585]  I also know that aluminum-coated fiberglass or chaff does disrupt radar.
[03:09:45.585 --> 03:09:52.726]  It makes it so that it's unworkable at times.
[03:09:52.726 --> 03:10:00.728]  But the military can look at the chaff that's dropped, and they can follow weather systems using chaff as it moves across the United States.
[03:10:01.451 --> 03:10:13.501]  So, they can use it for military purposes, disrupting radar, and they can also follow weather systems, and NASA and NOAA have both admitted that, and also the Weather Channel has mentioned it a couple of times.
[03:10:13.501 --> 03:10:27.272]  Yeah, and you actually were part of this big Discovery Channel chemical contrails, which aired in February of 07, really one of the only mainline shows to do this, and it was an hour-long special?
[03:10:27.272 --> 03:10:27.752]  Yes, it was.
[03:10:28.709 --> 03:10:35.195]  And does this still air every once in a while, or is it something that somebody's going to have to find on Google Video?
[03:10:35.195 --> 03:10:39.638]  It airs every once in a while.
[03:10:39.638 --> 03:10:42.301]  However, they did a bait-and-switch on me.
[03:10:42.301 --> 03:10:55.832]  They were supposed to have tested the actual jet plume in Canada, because they came here from Canada to interview me, and they told me that they were going to actually look at the jet plume, and they had the money,
[03:10:57.051 --> 03:11:03.612]  And they were going to send up the testing to do the testing of the plume to see what was in it.
[03:11:03.612 --> 03:11:08.273]  Later, they bait and switched and test jet fuel instead.
[03:11:08.273 --> 03:11:18.375]  And so there was a little bit of a twist in there that they said that we wanted the jet fuel tested, which I never requested in my entire life.
[03:11:18.375 --> 03:11:24.996]  And also, they turned some of the people into the experts from NASA.
[03:11:26.155 --> 03:11:36.063]  And NOAA and weather modification companies, and then tagged all of us who wanted to talk about the persistent jet contrails as chemtrail believers.
[03:11:36.063 --> 03:11:44.609]  So the narration in there has some things that they say about what I said and others said that isn't true.
[03:11:44.609 --> 03:11:53.196]  So I want everyone to know that it's a program to watch because they do give you a lot of statistics in that about what's happening in our skies.
[03:11:53.857 --> 03:12:08.284]  They do tell you about persistent jet contrails, and they also tell you that weather modification companies think that this water vapor going across our skies is just for theirs for the taking to move it from one place to another.
[03:12:08.284 --> 03:12:21.131]  But I think that weather modification programs are engaged in theft of my microclimates needed for agriculture to grow properly and sustain itself, and also it's theft because
[03:12:22.066 --> 03:12:29.790]  Um, I want the rainfall that would normally go to us and not have it taken and put us in a drought and taken for some other purpose.
[03:12:29.790 --> 03:12:33.372]  So, um, that's my statement on that program.
[03:12:33.372 --> 03:12:45.839]  Well, you know, the mainstream media is always going to try to marginalize us and make us out to be the kooks and try to, uh, promote the authoritize such as the people at NASA and within our military and government, because that's what they do.
[03:12:45.839 --> 03:12:47.080]  They're, they're just worshipers.
[03:12:47.080 --> 03:12:48.681]  They're, they're really never after the truth.
[03:12:48.681 --> 03:12:49.861]  It's very annoying.
[03:12:49.861 --> 03:12:51.362]  All right, let's go to a good guy.
[03:12:52.570 --> 03:12:55.431]  One thing I'd like to say about NASA.
[03:12:55.431 --> 03:13:07.174]  NASA instituted a children's school program going all the way from kindergarten to the 12th grade, starting in the late 1980s.
[03:13:07.174 --> 03:13:10.634]  And they started to talk about persistent jet contrails.
[03:13:10.634 --> 03:13:13.935]  They started to teach children that it was normal.
[03:13:13.935 --> 03:13:21.157]  They started to have children go through school countathons to look up in the skies and to count the contrails.
[03:13:21.678 --> 03:13:33.524]  And they even said that they couldn't see them from the ground, and because NASA couldn't see them from satellites, that they needed children, the expertise of children, to count these contrails.
[03:13:33.524 --> 03:13:35.645]  But we know that from 1994 to 1995, the U.S.
[03:13:35.645 --> 03:13:39.247]  military 24-7 counted contrails at one military airbase.
[03:13:39.247 --> 03:13:41.168]  So, I think that we're undergoing a systematic
[03:13:50.231 --> 03:13:58.214]  In other words, the education system to get us to believe that all this is normal always was here from the earliest history.
[03:13:58.214 --> 03:14:14.660]  However, jet engines haven't been here that long and these type of persistent contrails that covered one where one could cover 4,000 square miles is just not possible in early history because we didn't even have the type of airplanes.
[03:14:14.660 --> 03:14:16.281]  Yeah, well I see them always training us.
[03:14:16.281 --> 03:14:19.402]  I mean, I remember when I was in school it was all about global warming and
[03:14:19.790 --> 03:14:28.833]  You know the earth was going to die and it was going to be 20 degrees hotter and life on earth was going to change and now it's all about a carbon tax where they actually want to tax us for living.
[03:14:28.833 --> 03:14:46.640]  They want to tax you based on how much garbage you produce, how much fuel you use, how many cars you have and I don't know if you went to planetslayer.com it was affiliated with ABC News but they had this little thing where you type in your information and it would tell you when you were supposed to die according to your carbon credits
[03:14:47.054 --> 03:14:58.002]  And they had two pigs on the side and the human being was in the middle and literally it came up to like, you know, you're supposed to be dead by the time you're 14 to 16 months old because you've used up all of your carbon.
[03:14:58.002 --> 03:15:01.485]  It seems like a brainwashing program.
[03:15:01.485 --> 03:15:02.066]  It is.
[03:15:02.066 --> 03:15:10.412]  And you should read the Climate Security Act put out by Senator Lieberman and the one by Senator Boxer.
[03:15:10.412 --> 03:15:10.652]  U.S.
[03:15:10.652 --> 03:15:13.094]  Senate Bill 2191 is Lieberman's bill.
[03:15:13.846 --> 03:15:14.346]  And U.S.
[03:15:14.346 --> 03:15:17.847]  Senate Bill 3036 is Senator Boxer's bill.
[03:15:17.847 --> 03:15:19.627]  It's the Climate Security Act.
[03:15:19.627 --> 03:15:31.350]  But what they want to do is they want to charge all of this extra money as a carbon tax, and then they want to institute a private corporation that's going to buy and sell.
[03:15:31.350 --> 03:15:33.831]  It's called the Climate Credit Corporation.
[03:15:33.831 --> 03:15:43.213]  What it's going to do is buy and sell credits so that these bogus credits that polluters can buy, so that they can keep polluting.
[03:15:43.973 --> 03:15:49.937]  And it's an international market scheme, and it's a private corporation.
[03:15:49.937 --> 03:15:57.943]  The bill itself really has nothing to do with global warming or helping the climate or anything.
[03:15:57.943 --> 03:16:08.370]  It's about giving away our taxpayer dollars and instituting new taxes on us, just so that they can have this private corporation buy and sell credits on the market.
[03:16:09.082 --> 03:16:09.702]  I gotta agree with you.
[03:16:09.702 --> 03:16:10.963]  It's an amazing bill.
[03:16:10.963 --> 03:16:18.045]  Yeah, it's a form of control against the people to further tax them and further incur on their daily lives.
[03:16:18.045 --> 03:16:20.166]  Let's go to Kyle in Iowa.
[03:16:20.166 --> 03:16:21.847]  Kyle, what's on your mind?
[03:16:21.847 --> 03:16:22.967]  How's it going, Burmese?
[03:16:22.967 --> 03:16:24.688]  Good, man.
[03:16:24.688 --> 03:16:34.491]  Well, as you probably know, we've had all kinds of crazy weather here in Iowa lately, and me being an Alex Jones listener, I'm very observant as to my surroundings.
[03:16:34.491 --> 03:16:37.212]  I first want to start the story off with the fact that
[03:16:37.714 --> 03:16:46.158]  We just had a large immigration raid here, and FEMA just happened to be sticking around after that.
[03:16:46.158 --> 03:17:00.204]  Now, right after that FEMA raid, for the immigration, I had started noticing comm trails, chem trails, whatever you want to call them, in the sky, like, I mean, like crazy.
[03:17:00.204 --> 03:17:05.306]  The patterns I've noticed have been grids, like square-shaped grids, diamond grids,
[03:17:07.399 --> 03:17:10.960]  Patterns where they kind of, where it looks like they fan out.
[03:17:10.960 --> 03:17:15.380]  Now, since that immigration raid, we've had an F5 tornado come through here.
[03:17:15.380 --> 03:17:23.462]  It leveled two towns that are kind of within 20 miles of where I'm at.
[03:17:23.462 --> 03:17:26.882]  And then we had this record flooding.
[03:17:26.882 --> 03:17:29.283]  You know, just like boom, one right after another.
[03:17:29.283 --> 03:17:35.804]  And like for the flooding, it was crazy because weather would just pop out of nowhere, it seemed like, on the radar.
[03:17:36.334 --> 03:17:44.738]  And it would just continually just hit our river basin, you know, square in the nose, just right on the target, just boom, boom, boom, boom.
[03:17:44.738 --> 03:17:50.060]  So, you know, and there's tons of martial law things that have been happening around here.
[03:17:50.060 --> 03:18:02.226]  I really wonder if this isn't, with the FEMA raid and the chemtrails, I really wonder if this isn't just a part of a, I know it's speculatory, but I wonder if it's part of a larger
[03:18:08.994 --> 03:18:14.258]  I mean, we just talked about a carbon tax along with this whole thing.
[03:18:14.258 --> 03:18:17.441]  Don't you think there are many parts to this puzzle, Rosalyn?
[03:18:17.441 --> 03:18:19.803]  Oh, I think there's a lot of parts to this puzzle.
[03:18:19.803 --> 03:18:21.165]  I agree with you.
[03:18:21.165 --> 03:18:29.132]  And one of the things I want to say is these experimental weather modification programs that the list is public record and it's listed by NOAA out of Colorado.
[03:18:29.921 --> 03:18:37.065]  And I can tell you from looking at that list that it wouldn't surprise me a bit if your weather is being modified on purpose.
[03:18:37.065 --> 03:18:52.112]  Because I think these programs, even every year and ongoing, and where their capacity to disrupt more and more thousand square miles, I think that it certainly could have a cataclysmic effect.
[03:18:52.112 --> 03:18:56.334]  And also, everywhere people are talking about seeing more jets
[03:18:56.747 --> 03:19:04.111]  Leaving these persistent contrails and weird cloud formations just prior to storm systems coming in.
[03:19:04.111 --> 03:19:10.994]  Sometimes I think they dissipate the systems and other times I think that you do get a lot of excess rain from them.
[03:19:10.994 --> 03:19:17.297]  And I think that this is worth questioning what these jets are doing and what's going on.
[03:19:18.104 --> 03:19:20.547]  Absolutely, and we need to keep pressing for the truth.
[03:19:20.547 --> 03:19:22.229]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:19:22.229 --> 03:19:25.052]  PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com are the websites.
[03:19:25.052 --> 03:19:30.258]  We're going to continue to take your calls with Rosalind Peterson of CaliforniaSkyWatch.com.
[03:19:45.305 --> 03:19:50.829]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[03:19:50.829 --> 03:19:55.852]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for the American empire instead of what's fair for the American people.
[03:19:55.852 --> 03:20:02.037]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism, which is why you should be reading The Nationalist Times each month.

[03:21:53.859 --> 03:21:58.045]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[03:21:58.045 --> 03:21:59.987]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[03:21:59.987 --> 03:22:02.430]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[03:22:02.430 --> 03:22:08.779]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets
[03:22:08.919 --> 03:22:09.499]  We're good to go.

[03:24:00.656 --> 03:24:01.696]  All right, folks, we're back.
[03:24:01.696 --> 03:24:02.837]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:02.837 --> 03:24:03.837]  I am Jason Burmess.
[03:24:03.837 --> 03:24:06.078]  I'll be in all week.
[03:24:06.078 --> 03:24:14.343]  We are with Rosalind Peterson of CaliforniaSkyWatch.com, and we're talking chemtrails, weather modification, contrails.
[03:24:14.343 --> 03:24:15.083]  We're talking it all.
[03:24:15.083 --> 03:24:16.424]  If you missed any of it,
[03:24:16.991 --> 03:24:19.933]  You can check it out over at InfoWars.com at the bottom of the hour.
[03:24:19.933 --> 03:24:30.819]  We'll be replaying all four hours of the show and I want to let everybody know that Alex Jones' latest film, 9-11 Truth Rising... 9-11 Chronicles Truth Rising...
[03:24:31.252 --> 03:24:32.533]  is a blockbuster.
[03:24:32.533 --> 03:24:34.474]  I've seen it a couple times now.
[03:24:34.474 --> 03:24:38.497]  We sent it off to the DVD makers the other day, sent off the cover, the whole nine.
[03:24:38.497 --> 03:24:43.160]  It's going to be available to PrisonPlanet.TV subscribers on the 4th of July.
[03:24:43.160 --> 03:24:55.849]  And really this movie is unlike anything you've seen from Alex Jones with confrontations like the one with Zygmunt Brzezinski, David Rockefeller, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama gets asked some tough questions.
[03:24:55.849 --> 03:24:57.250]  I mean nobody's safe in this movie.
[03:24:57.250 --> 03:24:58.871]  Michael Bloomberg and others
[03:24:59.397 --> 03:24:59.577]  I don't
[03:25:21.701 --> 03:25:21.981]  I think so.
[03:25:43.137 --> 03:25:51.019]  And we know that they're denying it any significance whatsoever, and they're going to come out and say, and they already have in some sense, that it's good.
[03:25:51.019 --> 03:25:53.139]  It's to protect us from global warming.
[03:25:53.139 --> 03:25:54.859]  Be quiet.
[03:25:54.859 --> 03:25:56.940]  So that being said, let's take some more calls.
[03:25:56.940 --> 03:26:00.141]  Let's shoot to John in Utah, I think is next up.
[03:26:00.141 --> 03:26:00.661]  What's up, John?
[03:26:00.661 --> 03:26:02.141]  Hey, Jason.
[03:26:02.141 --> 03:26:02.761]  How are you?
[03:26:02.761 --> 03:26:04.341]  Good, man.
[03:26:04.341 --> 03:26:05.082]  Hey, Rosalynn.
[03:26:05.082 --> 03:26:06.062]  Thank you for being on.
[03:26:06.062 --> 03:26:07.822]  You're welcome.
[03:26:07.822 --> 03:26:11.503]  I have a little bit more of a nightmarish scenario considering all this.
[03:26:12.748 --> 03:26:16.631]  Um, I don't know if you guys have ever heard of John Kanzias.
[03:26:16.631 --> 03:26:25.619]  He is a man who has developed, uh, what looks like it may be a cure for cancer using nanoparticles with radio waves.
[03:26:25.619 --> 03:26:27.060]  No, I haven't heard anything about it.
[03:26:27.060 --> 03:26:28.782]  Well, it's been, it's been done.
[03:26:28.782 --> 03:26:31.464]  He actually discovered it in his garage a couple years ago.
[03:26:31.464 --> 03:26:34.667]  If you look him up on, just look up Kanzias and Google him.
[03:26:34.667 --> 03:26:37.389]  He's out there and he's got millions of dollars coming in.
[03:26:37.389 --> 03:26:40.852]  But the point is he, he, he took,
[03:26:41.846 --> 03:26:46.288]  Tiny particles of metal and injected it into animals.
[03:27:01.035 --> 03:27:06.240]  He actually found a frequency in which water would, salt water, would burn and create energy.
[03:27:06.240 --> 03:27:14.328]  Now, admittedly, the energy to put into the frequency is more than that that comes off of the salt water, so it's not zero-point energy.
[03:27:14.328 --> 03:27:19.854]  But it does show that water can be converted into fuel, and I believe he even modified his car, right?
[03:27:20.339 --> 03:27:24.623]  Well, the most interesting thing he did, I mean, that was like an accidental discovery.
[03:27:24.623 --> 03:27:29.467]  The fact that he could set the saltwater on fire, you know, left side to scratch in their heads.
[03:27:29.467 --> 03:27:29.827]  Yeah.
[03:27:29.827 --> 03:27:48.142]  But what he did was, and now the University of Texas over the last few months has done this with lab animals, they've actually put the nanoparticles, I think with gold attached to these nanoparticles, the nanoparticles went into the bodies of the animals, targeted their cancer, then they hit the animal with a certain radio frequency,
[03:27:48.952 --> 03:27:50.333]  And it killed the cancer.
[03:27:50.333 --> 03:27:55.296]  It slowly heats up the nanoparticles and destroyed the cancer.
[03:27:55.296 --> 03:27:55.817]  So what do you think?
[03:27:55.817 --> 03:27:59.179]  That they're putting these nanoparticles out there to give us cancer and other diseases?
[03:27:59.179 --> 03:28:00.840]  They're not going to give us cancer?
[03:28:00.840 --> 03:28:01.540]  I mean, think about it.
[03:28:01.540 --> 03:28:07.924]  You know, I started thinking, well, if I was some New World Order Nazi, what kind of a plan would I want to come up with?
[03:28:07.924 --> 03:28:15.629]  And I think the weather modification and other things are just distractions because how wonderful it would be to have nanoparticles.
[03:28:15.629 --> 03:28:16.850]  Everybody breathes them in.
[03:28:17.597 --> 03:28:19.818]  Say they target the brain.
[03:28:19.818 --> 03:28:27.783]  And you just had on your website, you had a story where they used a radio frequency machine on fake protesters.
[03:28:27.783 --> 03:28:32.846]  Well, if you could heat those nanoparticles up and they're in our brains, instant aneurysm.
[03:28:32.846 --> 03:28:33.467]  You're dead.
[03:28:33.467 --> 03:28:37.289]  Yeah, well, I'd just like to point out that the article that we did post, and I thank you for the call,
[03:28:37.797 --> 03:29:05.540]  is uh... the sound weapons and they they are openly testing them you can check them out and they have uh... volunteers and even people from the military and basically what they do is they stand them up in a row and then uh... they have this huge dish that's on the top of uh... one of their vehicles and they just shoot it forward and people just I guess they make them feel like their bodies on fire or something it's it's pretty crazy stuff we've been reporting on these uh... types of sound weapons now before the RNC in 2004
[03:29:07.679 --> 03:29:14.590]  So we're going to take more of your callers, hopefully on topic, with Rosalind Peterson of Californiaskywatch.com.
[03:29:14.590 --> 03:29:15.612]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:29:15.612 --> 03:29:17.034]  We'll be back after this.
[03:29:17.034 --> 03:29:19.078]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:29:35.595 --> 03:29:39.521]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:29:39.521 --> 03:29:45.770]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:45.770 --> 03:29:48.955]  Hi neighbor, this is Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[03:29:48.955 --> 03:29:51.498]  Life is a gamble, but you can stack the deck.
[03:29:52.455 --> 03:30:02.410]  If you knew what I know about all the problems food will protect you from, you'd start immediately to put every effort and dollar you can get into the biggest supply of food possible.
[03:30:02.410 --> 03:30:07.658]  When the dollar and economy crash, when the imported and genetically poisoned food is all that's left,
[03:30:08.298 --> 03:30:16.867]  When the quarantine and bird flu hit, our only protection and only chance to be fearless is having control of our own supply of food and enough of it.
[03:30:16.867 --> 03:30:25.075]  But if you knew what we haven't yet discovered, you wouldn't waste time listening to the rest of this announcement before charging out and getting a serious food supply.
[03:30:25.075 --> 03:30:28.298]  Decide, it's food now or probably never.
[03:30:28.298 --> 03:30:30.280]  But can you afford to be wrong?
[03:30:30.280 --> 03:30:31.461]  Decide now.
[03:30:31.461 --> 03:30:32.182]  Place your bet.
[03:30:33.015 --> 03:30:34.836]  Can you afford to be wrong?
[03:30:34.836 --> 03:30:40.660]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[03:30:40.660 --> 03:30:42.522]  Call 800-409-5633.
[03:30:42.522 --> 03:30:47.465]  It is a big idea.
[03:30:47.465 --> 03:30:50.267]  A new world order.
[03:30:50.267 --> 03:30:54.310]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:30:54.310 --> 03:30:57.992]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:30:57.992 --> 03:31:00.174]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:31:00.782 --> 03:31:03.945]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:31:03.945 --> 03:31:11.270]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:31:14.311 --> 03:31:19.754]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:31:19.754 --> 03:31:23.617]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:31:23.617 --> 03:31:26.178]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:31:26.178 --> 03:31:27.359]  Most people have no idea.
[03:31:27.359 --> 03:31:28.139]  They're not after money.
[03:31:28.139 --> 03:31:29.400]  They have all the money they need.
[03:31:29.400 --> 03:31:30.200]  They're after power.
[03:31:30.200 --> 03:31:31.541]  That's what they're after these years.
[03:31:31.541 --> 03:31:35.684]  Order in-game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[03:31:46.186 --> 03:31:48.866]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[03:31:48.866 --> 03:31:58.328]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[03:31:58.328 --> 03:32:05.429]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[03:32:06.149 --> 03:32:12.136]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[03:32:12.136 --> 03:32:22.929]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[03:32:23.710 --> 03:32:26.273]  Laser technology at its best!
[03:32:26.273 --> 03:32:29.457]  For more information call 702-953-0267 or visit www.lasemedinc.com Call 702-953-0267
[03:32:50.816 --> 03:32:51.956]  All right, folks.
[03:32:51.956 --> 03:32:52.457]  We're back.
[03:32:52.457 --> 03:32:54.177]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:32:54.177 --> 03:32:55.838]  Alex will be back on Sunday.
[03:32:55.838 --> 03:32:59.239]  He'll be checking in with us tomorrow, much as he did today, remember?
[03:32:59.239 --> 03:33:04.841]  So refeedinfowars.com after it's all over in 27 minutes.
[03:33:04.841 --> 03:33:09.022]  Let's jump to one more phone call for Rosalyn.
[03:33:09.022 --> 03:33:12.824]  Pete in Texas, what's on your mind, my man?
[03:33:12.824 --> 03:33:18.766]  I just wanted to share one of the interesting coincidences related to the weather, and that is
[03:33:19.707 --> 03:33:35.537]  When the recent cyclone hit Myanmar, I was listening to one of the mainstream news programs, Charles Gibson it might have been, and he reported that the Navy was doing an operation.
[03:33:35.537 --> 03:33:40.440]  It was actually a cyclone rescue operation off the coast of Myanmar.
[03:33:41.297 --> 03:33:43.158]  On the very day that the cyclone hit.
[03:33:43.158 --> 03:33:45.759]  Well, let me say this.
[03:33:45.759 --> 03:33:52.422]  Rebuilding America's Defense is the Project for a New American Century's document that talks about the new Pearl Harbor before 9-11 and all that other stuff.
[03:33:52.422 --> 03:33:56.443]  Well, they also talk about how the wars of the future aren't going to be fought on the battlefield.
[03:33:56.443 --> 03:34:01.125]  That they're actually going to be fought through biological warfare and weather weapons.
[03:34:01.125 --> 03:34:03.066]  And they're going to create earthquakes and all this other stuff.
[03:34:03.066 --> 03:34:05.027]  There's tons of documentation on it.
[03:34:05.027 --> 03:34:09.809]  Aircraft carriers loaded with helicopters
[03:34:10.501 --> 03:34:14.264]  And all kinds of rescue equipment ready to go ashore.
[03:34:14.264 --> 03:34:15.926]  Well, it's definitely suspicious, man.
[03:34:15.926 --> 03:34:25.615]  I just don't like to jump to conclusions, especially with the weather mod stuff with so much of it still being classified and so much of it still being denied and so much of it still being sketchy.
[03:34:25.615 --> 03:34:27.216]  Does it deserve to be looked into?
[03:34:27.216 --> 03:34:27.556]  You bet.
[03:34:27.556 --> 03:34:29.578]  I thank you for the call, Pete.
[03:34:29.578 --> 03:34:31.760]  Rosalind, what do you think about this sort of stuff?
[03:34:31.760 --> 03:34:32.901]  You know, I get this a lot.
[03:34:32.901 --> 03:34:36.645]  I mean, people tell me that Katrina was engineered, you know, that the
[03:34:37.788 --> 03:34:43.510]  Tsunami in Thailand was engineered, and now we have this big earthquake out in Manama.
[03:34:43.510 --> 03:34:49.392]  I mean, it's always a possibility, but there really isn't too much evidence to say that, is there?
[03:34:49.392 --> 03:34:51.352]  No, I don't think that there's too much evidence.
[03:34:51.352 --> 03:34:52.793]  There's a lot of speculation.
[03:34:52.793 --> 03:34:55.694]  There's a lot of people that make claims.
[03:34:55.694 --> 03:35:02.036]  I have yet to see any government documents that specifically state that some of this is engineered.
[03:35:02.678 --> 03:35:22.635]  I do know that the United States government, however, engineered a hurricane to hit at a certain place, and it backfired, and then they, in other words, the hurricane came inland and killed some people, and what they did in the United States was to classify it so they wouldn't have to pay any damages.
[03:35:22.635 --> 03:35:30.122]  So we do know that hurricanes right now are being modified by the Dynamat Corporation and NASA,
[03:35:31.125 --> 03:35:35.789]  And a couple of universities who are doing some research.
[03:35:35.789 --> 03:35:58.366]  So we do know that they're trying to shift them, and an MIT professor on one of the Discovery Channel programs was talking about using black contrails, and they showed the jets with this black contrails, leaving them on the West Coast, and then having weather systems, them causing weather systems to
[03:35:59.105 --> 03:36:05.069]  Move across the United States, and these weather systems would get larger and larger as they moved.
[03:36:05.069 --> 03:36:19.618]  And Professor Emmanuel at that point said that they could have these systems go across the United States to try to go off the East Coast to divert hurricanes away from certain areas along the East Coast.
[03:36:19.618 --> 03:36:28.463]  So, we don't know if they're actually implementing these, but the speculation here that they can do it, and they think it will work,
[03:36:29.167 --> 03:36:34.409]  From their models only means it's a matter of time before they put their models into action.
[03:36:34.409 --> 03:36:42.713]  But I suspect that if they're doing something like that, that could be one of the reasons we haven't seen hurricanes in a while in the United States.
[03:36:42.713 --> 03:36:53.258]  And also, I think that it could change weather systems and put states like Alabama and Oklahoma and other states into drought conditions and put too much rain somewhere else.
[03:36:54.696 --> 03:36:55.096]  This is
[03:37:18.666 --> 03:37:23.869]  The website is CaliforniaSkyWatch.com and I've got a ton of calls off topic.
[03:37:23.869 --> 03:37:30.533]  So, in closing, you know, where can people get the best information and what can people do about this?
[03:37:30.533 --> 03:37:45.921]  Well, I think that looking at government documents is where they can find their best information and I think when they want to do something locally, it's really important that they take their water samples, that they take their documents, government documents and studies,
[03:37:46.924 --> 03:38:01.070]  Um, and I think that they have to go to their water districts and make sure that they get the test results that are required by the EPA for aluminum and barium and where they'll know they'll be over state and federal standards.
[03:38:01.070 --> 03:38:08.453]  They need to get those and they need to start educating their local officials who really don't know anything about this topic.
[03:38:08.453 --> 03:38:13.995]  And they don't beat them up, but educate their staff, educate different people.
[03:38:14.514 --> 03:38:22.480]  And begin to really speak out about the impacts that these jets are having on human health, are having on agriculture, and our climate.
[03:38:22.480 --> 03:38:31.006]  There's a lot of experiments, and if we want to start breaking through the barrier, we can make a change, and we need all of your help to do that.
[03:38:31.006 --> 03:38:32.588]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[03:38:32.588 --> 03:38:33.989]  She's Rosalind Peterson.
[03:38:33.989 --> 03:38:35.850]  The website is California Skywatch.
[03:38:37.412 --> 03:38:47.798]  I'm so glad we had her on, because I just don't know that much about chemtrails, and it doesn't seem like there's too much public info out there, but her website's got a ton of great stuff.
[03:38:47.798 --> 03:38:49.139]  All right, let's take some of these callers.
[03:38:49.139 --> 03:38:54.582]  I know there are a few on topic, but we've got these off-topic ones, and about 20 minutes left in the show.
[03:38:54.582 --> 03:38:56.183]  Let's go to John in Canada.
[03:38:56.183 --> 03:38:58.244]  John, are you there?
[03:38:58.244 --> 03:38:58.925]  Hello.
[03:38:58.925 --> 03:39:00.305]  Hey, what's poppin'?
[03:39:00.305 --> 03:39:02.667]  Wow, what an interview that was.
[03:39:02.667 --> 03:39:04.228]  It was good to talk to you, Burmese, also.
[03:39:04.827 --> 03:39:08.088]  You know, life is interdependent upon everything else.
[03:39:08.088 --> 03:39:09.869]  Like, everything is connected to everything else.
[03:39:09.869 --> 03:39:13.790]  So, if you make a hurricane, it's going to have, you know, a problem over here somewhere.
[03:39:13.790 --> 03:39:15.350]  Nothing is separate.
[03:39:15.350 --> 03:39:16.591]  So, it's like Monsanto.
[03:39:16.591 --> 03:39:19.431]  Monsanto says, we know what we're doing, but scientists say, no, you don't.
[03:39:19.431 --> 03:39:21.052]  You're cross-kingdoming species.
[03:39:21.052 --> 03:39:22.652]  You're threatening all of our existence.
[03:39:22.652 --> 03:39:23.273]  And they go, so what?
[03:39:23.273 --> 03:39:24.973]  What are you going to do about it?
[03:39:24.973 --> 03:39:30.675]  You know, what we want is accountability, and we lose because we don't understand the nature of uncertainty.
[03:39:30.675 --> 03:39:31.035]  You know what?
[03:39:31.658 --> 03:39:40.101]  What can we conclusively understand factually that can't be disputed by anybody but censorship?
[03:39:40.101 --> 03:39:41.701]  Well, let's just say this, though.
[03:39:41.701 --> 03:39:43.122]  You know, what can we say?
[03:39:43.122 --> 03:39:50.804]  I mean, we're pointing at the planes, putting up the chemtrails, and literally the military is denying their very existence.
[03:39:50.804 --> 03:39:51.244]  Right.
[03:39:51.244 --> 03:39:52.144]  You see where I'm going with that?
[03:39:52.144 --> 03:39:53.105]  Right.
[03:39:53.105 --> 03:39:57.146]  So if that's true, then those who are flying those planes are enemies of America,
[03:39:57.668 --> 03:39:59.710]  And enemies of the people.
[03:39:59.710 --> 03:40:04.094]  So you gotta call out to soldiers and say, listen, these guys are enemies of us all.
[03:40:04.094 --> 03:40:07.657]  They claim that they're not even flying the planes and we have it on videotape.
[03:40:07.657 --> 03:40:11.000]  So it's communicating and what we need is open debate.
[03:40:11.000 --> 03:40:19.308]  We need to ask everybody to put in an effort to demand open debate on these critical issues that involve your lives and deaths.
[03:40:19.308 --> 03:40:19.848]  You know, like with 9-11.
[03:40:20.885 --> 03:40:23.026]  You know, Mark Dice is an awesome guy.
[03:40:23.026 --> 03:40:23.726]  He's incredible.
[03:40:23.726 --> 03:40:24.807]  He's got his website there.
[03:40:24.807 --> 03:40:26.007]  He's amazing.
[03:40:26.007 --> 03:40:35.551]  But I just so much wished he'd had practice at debate, because he could have just said, you know, it's the FBI's formal conclusion that General Ahmad financed this operation.
[03:40:35.551 --> 03:40:40.432]  We have videotape of iron flowing from the tower of, like, water.
[03:40:40.432 --> 03:40:41.153]  There's no dispute.
[03:40:41.153 --> 03:40:42.433]  It's on videotape.
[03:40:42.433 --> 03:40:48.635]  And those that tell you bin Laden set the explosives in the Building 7 have a few more questions we'd like to ask them.
[03:40:48.635 --> 03:40:50.096]  And if we demand open debate,
[03:40:50.586 --> 03:40:51.908]  And the lines go silent.
[03:40:51.908 --> 03:40:53.550]  You're going to know what true evil is.
[03:40:53.550 --> 03:41:02.861]  You know, these people who kill ourselves and rape our families, do it in silence and darkness and pretend they're real men, when really they're enemies of us all.
[03:41:02.861 --> 03:41:09.849]  And we just have to isolate through the evidence trail who specifically, personally, is responsible.
[03:41:10.313 --> 03:41:13.835]  For these crimes going unaddressed, as unarrested.
[03:41:13.835 --> 03:41:14.436]  And we can do it.
[03:41:14.436 --> 03:41:16.177]  It's not that complicated.
[03:41:16.177 --> 03:41:27.104]  One thing, George Walker Bush himself demanded the ending of criminal inquiries on 9-11 questions immediately after the terrorist event went down.
[03:41:27.104 --> 03:41:28.985]  According to Tom Daschle.
[03:41:28.985 --> 03:41:34.388]  Well, Cheney actually called Daschle and said he wanted him to limit the investigation on several different occasions.
[03:41:34.388 --> 03:41:35.549]  And of course, Tom Daschle
[03:41:35.939 --> 03:41:39.542]  Was the one who got, uh, Anthrax delivered to his office.
[03:41:39.542 --> 03:41:40.703]  I thank you for the call.
[03:41:40.703 --> 03:41:43.385]  Yeah, I mean, there are a lot of fingers to be pointed.
[03:41:43.385 --> 03:41:45.787]  I really, truly believe we can indict Cheney for 9-11.
[03:41:45.787 --> 03:41:47.449]  I think that's where you start.
[03:41:47.449 --> 03:41:49.351]  You know, you definitely start with Cheney.
[03:41:49.351 --> 03:41:50.592]  You indict him there.
[03:41:50.592 --> 03:42:02.722]  Then you go after the FBI and their obstruction of justice, uh, from not only the General Ahmed $100,000 wire transfer, but the obstruction of justice into John O'Neill's investigation and into Robert Wright and Barry Carmody's investigation.
[03:42:03.376 --> 03:42:16.480]  Okay, that's why Dennis Kucinich was on the floor in his 33rd article of impeachment saying that they were covering up things and thwarting FBI investigations prior to 9-11.
[03:42:16.480 --> 03:42:17.380]  Go, Mr. Kucinich.
[03:42:17.380 --> 03:42:20.621]  Alright, let's go to Frank in Florida.
[03:42:20.621 --> 03:42:21.862]  Frank, you there?
[03:42:21.862 --> 03:42:22.902]  Hey, good afternoon.
[03:42:22.902 --> 03:42:24.502]  A couple quick questions.
[03:42:24.502 --> 03:42:27.563]  I was wondering, in Final Cut, you got the cab driver.
[03:42:27.563 --> 03:42:32.525]  Seems to me he says that he saw the plane come over and hit the light poles, but then
[03:42:33.112 --> 03:42:37.775]  Later, you know, it looks like he's out of the house or something, and he's saying, you would think I would have seen it.
[03:42:37.775 --> 03:42:40.617]  And I was wondering if you could clarify, what is this guy saying?
[03:42:40.617 --> 03:42:41.157]  Alright, sure.
[03:42:41.157 --> 03:42:44.719]  Well, I have the whole interview and I've seen it, I met Lloyd.
[03:42:44.719 --> 03:42:48.782]  He says that he didn't see the plane clip the light poles.
[03:42:48.782 --> 03:43:00.989]  He says he saw the plane go over him, a light pole fell on his car, and when he looked over there was a huge explosion, he never saw the plane actually hit the building, and he said he was really confused,
[03:43:01.414 --> 03:43:08.524]  Because the hole was really small and he didn't see any wings or tail section or anything that the plane had actually hit the building.
[03:43:08.524 --> 03:43:10.867]  He himself seemed a little confused.
[03:43:11.297 --> 03:43:16.219]  Yeah, okay, because in Final Cut he says, you know, he got out of the car and it was all quiet and he didn't see anything.
[03:43:16.219 --> 03:43:17.680]  Yeah, well, that's, that's, that's the truth.
[03:43:17.680 --> 03:43:18.340]  That's what he says.
[03:43:18.340 --> 03:43:20.261]  He says he didn't see it hit the building.
[03:43:20.261 --> 03:43:22.182]  He says he saw the, uh, the hole.
[03:43:22.182 --> 03:43:23.282]  It didn't look quite big.
[03:43:23.282 --> 03:43:26.383]  He, he, you know, watched as the explosion happened.
[03:43:26.383 --> 03:43:31.806]  He said it all happened so fast because out of nowhere, you know, this light pole came through his front window.
[03:43:31.806 --> 03:43:32.286]  Yeah.
[03:43:32.286 --> 03:43:32.566]  Yeah.
[03:43:32.566 --> 03:43:39.829]  But then he also says that someone, and this is, uh, you know, Craig and Aldo over at the Pentagon, you know, and, and I like those guys, you know, I, I don't think
[03:43:40.179 --> 03:43:44.220]  That we have all the answers but I like other people putting out their opinions.
[03:43:44.220 --> 03:43:47.060]  They seem to think that he might be in on it and this and that.
[03:43:47.060 --> 03:43:48.501]  I don't know if I agree with that.
[03:43:48.501 --> 03:43:56.022]  Apparently somebody drove up to him and helped him physically take the light pole off and put it in the back of a truck.
[03:43:56.022 --> 03:43:58.602]  I found that part of the story pretty suspicious.
[03:43:58.602 --> 03:44:03.503]  But there is no doubt that Lloyd was there on the scene in some capacity.
[03:44:03.503 --> 03:44:07.204]  There's plenty of photographs and videos that put him at the scene and what's
[03:44:08.038 --> 03:44:08.258]  Good grief.
[03:44:08.258 --> 03:44:08.318]  Man!
[03:44:30.535 --> 03:44:39.861]  One real quick one, and you can hang up if you need to, but Hess, the attorney in New York, the heavyset gentleman with glasses that says that they were up on the 8th floor.
[03:44:39.861 --> 03:44:41.122]  That's Barry Jennings.
[03:44:41.122 --> 03:44:43.024]  That's Barry Jennings, that's not Michael Hess.
[03:44:43.024 --> 03:44:45.365]  Barry Jennings is a... Right, but Hess was with them.
[03:44:45.365 --> 03:44:46.186]  Yep.
[03:44:46.186 --> 03:44:54.252]  And it seems to me that one time, and I never heard it again, was a recording of them saying that there were bodies in World Trade Center 7.
[03:44:55.566 --> 03:44:59.429]  Not half, but Jennings.
[03:44:59.429 --> 03:45:12.221]  What happened was that we went there, we got his permission, I got the full interview with Barry Jennings, we put out some audio clips and literally the next day people had found out where he worked and the deal was we weren't going to say where he worked because he didn't want to get fired.
[03:45:12.221 --> 03:45:13.782]  He was two years away from retirement.
[03:45:14.022 --> 03:45:15.203]  People started calling him up.
[03:45:15.203 --> 03:45:22.106]  All those all those lovely debunkers that have our best interests at heart started calling up, threatening him, you know, saying this is what you felt.
[03:45:22.106 --> 03:45:23.306]  This is this is the truth.
[03:45:23.306 --> 03:45:24.527]  How dare you?
[03:45:24.527 --> 03:45:27.048]  And he got in touch with us and said, look, they're going to fire me.
[03:45:27.048 --> 03:45:29.009]  You can't use this footage.
[03:45:29.009 --> 03:45:30.209]  And we respected him.
[03:45:30.209 --> 03:45:32.730]  We said, all right, you know, we don't want to see you get fired.
[03:45:32.730 --> 03:45:34.211]  He was a very nice gentleman.
[03:45:34.211 --> 03:45:36.252]  You know, he had seen Loose Chain Second Edition.
[03:45:36.252 --> 03:45:38.713]  He literally had the key to the city from Giuliani.
[03:45:38.713 --> 03:45:40.354]  He knew it was up and
[03:45:41.596 --> 03:45:51.361]  You know, it sucks, but at the same time, I'm going to be putting that in Fabled Enemies because he got interviewed by the BBC recently and he's going to tell his story on a major news network.
[03:45:51.361 --> 03:45:53.461]  Well, I have to tell the story unedited.
[03:45:53.461 --> 03:45:57.884]  You know, I have to show that there were dead bodies in that lobby and that they were stepping over them.
[03:45:57.884 --> 03:46:05.327]  I have to show that he was in that 23rd floor in an abandoned area that should not have been abandoned at all with Michael Hassan, that explosions were going off.
[03:46:05.771 --> 03:46:06.372]  In that building.
[03:46:06.372 --> 03:46:08.113]  So check out Fabled Enemies when it comes out.
[03:46:08.113 --> 03:46:10.756]  It should hit at the end of August, early September.
[03:46:10.756 --> 03:46:12.297]  Frank, thanks for the phone call.
[03:46:12.297 --> 03:46:14.900]  Alright, let's go to Dave in California.
[03:46:14.900 --> 03:46:16.602]  Dave is on topic on the chemtrails.
[03:46:16.602 --> 03:46:17.563]  What's up, man?
[03:46:17.563 --> 03:46:18.123]  Hi, Jason.
[03:46:18.123 --> 03:46:19.184]  Sorry, I missed your guest.
[03:46:19.184 --> 03:46:20.085]  It was a good one.
[03:46:20.085 --> 03:46:21.166]  Yeah, it was a good one.
[03:46:21.166 --> 03:46:24.229]  Okay, well, I'm north of Rosalind's area.
[03:46:24.229 --> 03:46:26.932]  Mendocino is about 200 miles south of me.
[03:46:26.932 --> 03:46:29.234]  And I'm inland about 50 miles off of the coast.
[03:46:29.841 --> 03:46:35.063]  And one piece of good news is we've had high, clear blue sky for about a week right now.
[03:46:35.063 --> 03:46:37.444]  And boy, you can really tell it when they're not spraying.
[03:46:37.444 --> 03:46:38.564]  It's just, it's so beautiful.
[03:46:38.564 --> 03:46:40.164]  You can see the stars at night.
[03:46:40.164 --> 03:46:45.966]  But I want to bring up something that's, that's, I seem to be the only guy that's talking about it.
[03:46:45.966 --> 03:46:49.387]  I'm on the chemtrail issue, but, but it could be related to chemtrail.
[03:46:49.387 --> 03:46:50.548]  It could be related to fluoride.
[03:46:50.548 --> 03:46:53.369]  It could be related to GMO or it could be something.
[03:46:53.369 --> 03:46:55.029]  I have no idea.
[03:46:55.029 --> 03:46:57.110]  Maybe it's a local thing, but, uh,
[03:46:57.745 --> 03:47:08.093]  What we see up here in the wilderness, I'm surrounded by wilderness on every side, is an incredibly huge die-off of all the insects.
[03:47:08.093 --> 03:47:11.936]  Well, that may tie in with all those bees dying that Alex talks about.
[03:47:11.936 --> 03:47:15.739]  Right, the bees were the most noticeable, yes.
[03:47:15.739 --> 03:47:24.866]  And you know, Rosalind just talked about how this could very heavily affect our ecosystem and all the life in it, not only the animals and the insects, but the trees as well.
[03:47:25.307 --> 03:47:26.928]  And I suspect that's what's happening.
[03:47:26.928 --> 03:47:27.489]  That's what's happening.
[03:47:27.489 --> 03:47:34.114]  You know, my brother, you know, he has a young daughter and he's always talking about, I can't believe how much these kids are sick these days.
[03:47:34.114 --> 03:47:52.249]  And he really believes that it has something to do with all these chemtrails, you know, the fact that they're, you know, putting all this crap in the foods, that they're literally trying to kill us by killing our immune system first, by killing off the wildlife, by introducing these toxins into our system that we won't be able to fight in the years to come.
[03:47:52.249 --> 03:47:53.310]  I mean, it's a possibility.
[03:47:53.310 --> 03:47:54.491]  It's a horrific possibility.
[03:47:55.950 --> 03:47:58.431]  Can you give me Rosalynn's email?
[03:47:58.431 --> 03:47:59.471]  I didn't catch it.
[03:47:59.471 --> 03:48:05.573]  I'm not sure what her email is, but if you go to CaliforniaSkyWatch.com, all the links are there, and she's got a ton of information.
[03:48:05.573 --> 03:48:06.753]  Thanks for the call, Dave.
[03:48:06.753 --> 03:48:07.393]  You got it, man.
[03:48:07.393 --> 03:48:11.135]  All right, let's go to Will in Philly, also on topic.
[03:48:11.135 --> 03:48:12.075]  What's up, Will?
[03:48:12.075 --> 03:48:13.115]  Great show, Jason.
[03:48:13.115 --> 03:48:14.916]  Thank you, buddy.
[03:48:14.916 --> 03:48:17.336]  I wanted to talk to Mrs. Peterson.
[03:48:17.336 --> 03:48:18.597]  I just wanted... She's listening.
[03:48:18.597 --> 03:48:21.097]  Thank you so much for standing up.
[03:48:21.097 --> 03:48:22.658]  It takes a lot of courage to do this.
[03:48:24.203 --> 03:48:28.146]  You know they like to kill lots of birds with one stone, Jason.
[03:48:28.146 --> 03:48:30.989]  In 9-11 they got their renovation project.
[03:48:30.989 --> 03:48:36.553]  They got their false flag justification for invasion of Iraq.
[03:48:36.553 --> 03:48:39.955]  They killed John O'Neill and probably a ton of others.
[03:48:39.955 --> 03:48:44.359]  With these chemtrails, I believe they're doing the same thing.
[03:48:44.359 --> 03:48:51.564]  They have the protective guise of weather modification if all fails and they get found out.
[03:48:52.150 --> 03:49:08.237]  These nandle particulates we're breathing in, from the research I've done, essentially make us walking antennas, highly susceptible to the microwave weaponry of HAARP, a shell of revolution.
[03:49:08.237 --> 03:49:11.498]  Conduits for this, if you will.
[03:49:13.157 --> 03:49:32.425]  Well, you know, I've heard that and that's another damn scary possibility, but an actual real one, you know, a few years back, I think it's like three or four, the military actually talked about a smart dust that they had, that they would just spread this dust and it would create this network and people would literally be able to breathe it in and wouldn't even know because it was so
[03:49:32.858 --> 03:49:40.404]  Because it was nanotechnology basically and it would set up this network and they would be able to tell what was within this smart dust network.
[03:49:40.404 --> 03:49:41.205]  So, you know what?
[03:49:41.205 --> 03:49:43.026]  It's a definite possibility, man.
[03:49:43.026 --> 03:49:45.688]  I just try not to speculate too hard.
[03:49:45.688 --> 03:49:47.570]  I'd say give her an email, see what she thinks.
[03:49:47.570 --> 03:49:48.491]  Thanks, Will.
[03:49:48.491 --> 03:49:50.572]  Alright, Turtle, he's been holding forever.
[03:49:50.572 --> 03:49:53.175]  I apologize, but we're gonna go to him.
[03:49:53.175 --> 03:49:54.315]  I think he just came back on.
[03:49:54.315 --> 03:49:55.617]  He's from We Are Change Colorado.
[03:49:55.617 --> 03:49:57.338]  What's up, Turtle?
[03:49:57.338 --> 03:49:58.159]  Oh, not much, man.
[03:49:58.159 --> 03:50:00.721]  I was just calling up to comment on the chemtrails.
[03:50:01.528 --> 03:50:08.277]  Out here in Colorado, yeah, you can wake up in the morning and the day's beautiful blue sky.
[03:50:08.277 --> 03:50:13.423]  Between 8 and 10 o'clock there's planes and by noon, nothing but a haze.
[03:50:13.423 --> 03:50:17.368]  Yeah, it's amazing that they can deny the very existence of these chemtrails, isn't it?
[03:50:17.368 --> 03:50:19.291]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:50:19.861 --> 03:50:26.907]  You know, I mean, when you can look up in the sky and see them, sometimes you can see two planes flying side by side, you know, one with the contrail and one with the chemtrail.
[03:50:26.907 --> 03:50:30.830]  Oh yeah, I see it all the time, and sometimes I see four doing crosshatch patterns.
[03:50:30.830 --> 03:50:31.991]  Turtle, thanks for the call.
[03:50:31.991 --> 03:50:34.093]  It's the Alex Jones Show final segment after this.
[03:50:45.683 --> 03:50:51.526]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[03:50:51.526 --> 03:50:56.949]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[03:50:56.949 --> 03:51:02.332]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[03:51:02.332 --> 03:51:07.855]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[03:51:08.215 --> 03:51:14.460]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[03:51:14.460 --> 03:51:18.243]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[03:51:18.243 --> 03:51:23.067]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[03:51:23.067 --> 03:51:24.108]  Do your part.
[03:51:24.108 --> 03:51:26.310]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!

[03:51:45.376 --> 03:51:48.237]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[03:51:48.237 --> 03:51:49.798]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[03:51:49.798 --> 03:51:51.938]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[03:51:51.938 --> 03:51:53.839]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.

[03:51:55.340 --> 03:51:57.100]  America, freedom to fascism.

[03:54:01.374 --> 03:54:07.397]  It's the Alex Jones Show final segment.
[03:54:07.397 --> 03:54:08.157]  I'm Jason Bermas.
[03:54:08.157 --> 03:54:09.498]  I'll be in the rest of the week.
[03:54:09.498 --> 03:54:11.278]  Alex Jones will be joining us tomorrow.
[03:54:11.278 --> 03:54:12.399]  He joined us today.
[03:54:12.399 --> 03:54:16.321]  And remember, if you missed any of this broadcast, and we covered it all, folks.
[03:54:16.321 --> 03:54:19.962]  We covered the drills over at the DNC.
[03:54:19.962 --> 03:54:28.026]  We covered 1092, which is the resolution for Oklahoma to secede from the United States.
[03:54:28.746 --> 03:54:29.506]  Well, good afternoon, Jason.
[03:54:29.506 --> 03:54:30.587]  I'm sorry I missed your guest.
[03:54:30.587 --> 03:54:35.950]  I just caught the tail end of the interview with Rosalind, so I hope I'm not covering any ground that's already been covered.
[03:54:35.950 --> 03:54:36.490]  I live in Green Bay.
[03:54:59.506 --> 03:55:27.061]  Wisconsin just recently became aware of the issue of chemtrails in March of this year and at that point I occasionally started reminding myself to simply look up and much to my surprise I started seeing these persistent trails in the sky and not only in Green Bay but in Milwaukee and all points in between throughout April and May and man I can't begin to tell you how mad I started getting so I just started videotaping these incidents and showed some of my friends who couldn't believe what they're seeing so
[03:55:27.970 --> 03:55:38.860]  No, I haven't seen much in the air in the past week or so, but given the recent flooding we've seen in southern Wisconsin, eastern Wisconsin, Iowa, and elsewhere in the Midwest, I was wondering if this recent spate of
[03:55:41.988 --> 03:55:50.831]  Well, in her opinion, it's all about weather modification.
[03:55:50.831 --> 03:55:56.993]  Go check out CaliforniaSkyWatch.com and listen to the rebroadcast, because she makes it quite clear she feels this is weather mod.
[03:55:56.993 --> 03:56:04.496]  She doesn't even want to call them chemtrails, because the US military calls that a hoax, and she wants to stay in terms where they're going to address her.
[03:56:04.496 --> 03:56:05.277]  Thank you for the call, Bob.
[03:56:05.277 --> 03:56:07.277]  Let's jump to Steve in Florida.
[03:56:07.277 --> 03:56:08.718]  Steve, are you there?
[03:56:08.718 --> 03:56:09.038]  Yeah, I'm here.
[03:56:09.349 --> 03:56:10.830]  What's up Steve?
[03:56:10.830 --> 03:56:12.151]  Not much.
[03:56:12.151 --> 03:56:15.072]  I've been following this whole New World Order, Illuminati stuff for a long time.
[03:56:15.072 --> 03:56:17.454]  There's something that I've come across a couple of times.
[03:56:17.454 --> 03:56:21.596]  I was wondering if you had any extra information on something called Project Bluebeam?
[03:56:21.596 --> 03:56:23.257]  No, I don't know much about Project Bluebeam.
[03:56:23.257 --> 03:56:24.898]  Why don't you tell us?
[03:56:24.898 --> 03:56:28.481]  It's something, because, I mean, first I'd like to let you know, because I heard you talk about aliens.
[03:56:28.481 --> 03:56:35.525]  I don't believe in none of that stuff, so I don't think I'm trying to say that, but something that apparently NASA was working on where maybe it starts off with a whole bunch of
[03:56:36.582 --> 03:56:43.024]  Certain fossil discoveries produced by earthquakes that they make to disprove God, and then they simulate like a... Project Blue Beam.
[03:56:43.024 --> 03:56:45.585]  Maybe that's the one... Wait a minute, I do think I know what that one is.
[03:56:45.585 --> 03:56:48.506]  Is that the one where they're gonna put up a big Buddha?
[03:56:48.506 --> 03:56:49.306]  A hologram Buddha?
[03:56:49.306 --> 03:56:52.527]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, like fake alien invasion of the flare mark of all... Yeah, yeah, you know what?
[03:56:52.527 --> 03:56:56.028]  Knowing that's covered, I'll tell you where you can find some great information about that.
[03:56:56.028 --> 03:57:00.750]  In Order Out of Chaos, Paul Joseph Watson's book, there's a whole chapter dedicated to it.
[03:57:00.750 --> 03:57:04.271]  Not just that project, but the fake alien invasion.
[03:57:04.770 --> 03:57:05.410]  It seems like
[03:57:31.303 --> 03:57:33.567]  Only Alex Jones is really willing to tackle.
[03:57:33.567 --> 03:57:37.132]  We have got to start criticizing our soldiers, okay?
[03:57:37.132 --> 03:57:38.114]  We love them.
[03:57:38.114 --> 03:57:39.736]  There are women in our church.
[03:57:39.736 --> 03:57:42.801]  If they're going to follow every black operation order,
[03:57:48.189 --> 03:57:55.230]  Hey, I'm with you Richard.
[03:57:55.230 --> 03:57:55.910]  I gotta let you go.
[03:57:55.910 --> 03:57:57.491]  It's the final moment of the show.
