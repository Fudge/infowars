[00:00:04.935 --> 00:00:06.235]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.235 --> 00:00:07.996]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.996 --> 00:00:09.757]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.757 --> 00:00:11.337]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.337 --> 00:00:12.898]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.898 --> 00:00:17.099]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:21.161]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:38.961]  This is an incredibly important broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:00:38.961 --> 00:00:48.210]  We have Congressman Brad Sherman joining us, coming up later in the show today.
[00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.777]  They are debating live on the House floor last night and this morning.
[00:00:57.462 --> 00:01:08.927]  And last night he revealed what we had already gotten from two separate congressmen who said behind the scenes there had been discussions of martial law.
[00:01:08.927 --> 00:01:16.990]  Not just martial law in the Congress and on the House rules.
[00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:26.014]  Basically where the leaders of the House and Senate can break whatever rules they want and ram things through.
[00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.112]  But literal martial law.
[00:01:30.112 --> 00:01:33.735]  Physical martial law.
[00:01:33.735 --> 00:01:53.008]  And this goes on the heels of Northcom announcing in an interview in the Army Times, officially, that they want to bring army brigades in, and is now activated October 1st, one brigade and more brigades to be trained for civil unrest to use non-lethal weapons, microwave guns, sound cannons,
[00:01:54.212 --> 00:02:05.177]  mainstream news give dictatorial sweeping powers, those are the terms used by the Washington Post and others, dictatorial sweeping to the Treasury to buy, sell, do whatever they want.
[00:02:05.177 --> 00:02:11.479]  This is economic martial law, but the Congress is being threatened that if they don't go along with this there will be physical martial law.
[00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:20.263]  Now remember, a few months ago several congressmen when they were asked separately, Democrats on the East Coast, why aren't you being
[00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:34.719]  More aggressive and pushing for impeachment, and they said because martial law will be declared and the president will launch an attack on Iran as the pretext to do it.
[00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:37.321]  So, this is happening, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:37.321 --> 00:02:43.026]  They are seriously considering ending the republic dictatorship flat out.
[00:02:43.026 --> 00:02:48.031]  And don't think for a minute that they can't pull this after John McCain or Barack Obama is in there.
[00:02:48.031 --> 00:02:51.574]  These men are total fronts for the very same institutions.
[00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.431]  And they're identical on all the real policies.
[00:02:55.431 --> 00:03:10.579]  While the public is watching that ridiculous, scripted, non-debate last night, with talking points repeated like parrots over and over again, by those two establishment parrots, the real world is going to Hades in a handbasket, as they say.
[00:03:14.406 --> 00:03:24.973]  When we get back, we're going to play the clip of Congressman Brad Sherman, Marshal Law, and go over some of the current developments here, and then go over the backstory that's key.
[00:03:24.973 --> 00:03:31.838]  And we have several other guests I'll tell you about after the break as well that are coming up today, not just the Congressman.
[00:03:31.838 --> 00:03:38.122]  By the way, Trey, I want you to call Ron Paul's people and say, look, you know, we know the Congressman likes to come on once a month,
[00:03:38.695 --> 00:03:42.199]  They even call us whenever we don't call them to have a once a month visit.
[00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:43.661]  I know he was just gone last week.
[00:03:43.661 --> 00:03:44.562]  We can't wait for that.
[00:03:44.562 --> 00:03:50.590]  We need Ron Paul to comment on what is really going on in the House right now and if he has been told this.
[00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.914]  So I want you to call Ron Paul right now, Trey.
[00:03:53.914 --> 00:03:56.117]  Call the Congressional end.
[00:03:57.054 --> 00:03:58.656]  That's who's honchoing everything.
[00:03:58.656 --> 00:04:00.418]  And then call the Liberty Committee.
[00:04:00.418 --> 00:04:04.422]  Call Benton up right now and say, look, this is hot.
[00:04:04.422 --> 00:04:12.890]  We want Ron Paul on even if it's five minutes to comment on the reports of the Congress, the House, being threatened with martial law.
[00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.193]  We got Representative Brad Sherman coming up later.
[00:04:17.751 --> 00:04:21.396]  We're going to try to get Paul on for you today as well, if not today, Sunday.
[00:04:21.396 --> 00:04:23.678]  Because he needs to respond to this.
[00:04:23.678 --> 00:04:27.283]  He is the predominant leader of the Liberty Movement, and he needs to comment.
[00:04:30.558 --> 00:04:33.119]  They say you can't predict the stock market.
[00:04:33.119 --> 00:04:36.561]  If you trade on a regular basis, you've probably heard that lie.
[00:04:36.561 --> 00:04:42.204]  But what if I told you there's a way to know which way the market will go each week, a whole week in advance?
[00:04:42.204 --> 00:04:44.965]  Do you think you could benefit from this kind of information?
[00:04:44.965 --> 00:04:49.548]  The guys over at eminiforecaster.com put out a weekly forecast line.
[00:04:49.548 --> 00:04:54.911]  They call it a G-line, which forecasts the direction of the stock market a whole week in advance.
[00:04:54.911 --> 00:04:55.431]  Impossible?
[00:04:55.831 --> 00:05:01.054]  Head over to eminiforecaster.com and check out their forecast history to see for yourself.
[00:05:01.054 --> 00:05:05.316]  Eminiforecaster.com predicts the market one whole week in advance.
[00:05:05.316 --> 00:05:09.278]  It's simple to use and can give you the market edge you've been looking for.

[00:05:18.503 --> 00:05:21.705]  Again, that's E-M-I-N-I forecaster.com.
[00:05:23.624 --> 00:05:28.986]  This is Rob at eminyforecaster.com, and I approve this message.
[00:05:28.986 --> 00:05:34.707]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:05:34.707 --> 00:05:36.048]  And we knew what to do.
[00:05:36.048 --> 00:05:38.028]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:05:38.028 --> 00:05:45.050]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:53.333]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:05:55.137 --> 00:05:55.818]  Breathe.
[00:05:55.818 --> 00:06:02.927]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:06:02.927 --> 00:06:06.090]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:11.878]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:06:11.878 --> 00:06:14.441]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:06:14.921 --> 00:06:20.844]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[00:06:20.844 --> 00:06:23.905]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:06:23.905 --> 00:06:28.807]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:06:30.185 --> 00:06:33.627]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[00:06:33.627 --> 00:06:35.928]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[00:06:35.928 --> 00:06:39.230]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:46.114]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:48.235]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[00:06:48.735 --> 00:06:52.017]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[00:06:52.017 --> 00:06:56.820]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.742]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[00:07:00.742 --> 00:07:02.383]  Travel less, meet online.

[00:07:16.471 --> 00:07:19.633]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:19.633 --> 00:07:22.154]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:07:50.916 --> 00:07:58.941]  Ladies and gentlemen, one of the most important broadcasts we've ever done is now taking place.
[00:07:58.941 --> 00:08:06.606]  Previously, going back over a decade, I would maybe say that once a year or so, always in progression, things getting more serious.
[00:08:06.606 --> 00:08:11.929]  Now, every few weeks, I come on air and say that, and it's because everything just intensifies.
[00:08:11.929 --> 00:08:15.011]  Everything is getting more and more serious by the minute.
[00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:34.169]  We have seen the unbelievable financial terrorism, the financial 9-11 of the White House, the Treasury Secretary, the Speaker of the House, the Leader of the Senate, both parties out saying, John McCain saying, pass the bailout bill or there will be a depression.
[00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:36.151]  And then we watch the controlled stock market
[00:08:36.758 --> 00:08:52.644]  Through the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, known as the Plunge Protection Team, not dump money in five days ago on Monday, when the Banker Takeover Bill, the Economic Marshall Law Bill, and that's what it really is, in clear black and white,
[00:08:53.795 --> 00:08:54.596]  Did not pass.
[00:08:54.596 --> 00:08:57.939]  And when it didn't, they did not prop the stock market up.
[00:08:57.939 --> 00:09:10.810]  They prop it up every day with tens of billions, in some cases hundreds of billions, of liquidity and government agencies buying stocks and engaging in all sorts of manipulation.
[00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:19.358]  Now, the Banker Takeover Bill codifies that into law, gives them total immunity and absolute power above and beyond the Congress and even the President.
[00:09:19.358 --> 00:09:20.779]  It is unbelievable.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:35.346]  And people keep thinking, we've had guests on who kept thinking over the last couple weeks, oh, they're going to take this provision out where it says the Treasury Secretary is non-reviewable by any branch of government or by any court of law or any police agency.
[00:09:35.346 --> 00:09:36.666]  Well, guess what?
[00:09:36.666 --> 00:09:45.150]  I've got multiple mainstream reports today who've analyzed it, and even they're saying there's more powers in here than what was previously in it.
[00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:50.412]  This is a complete and total takeover, so make no mistake, this is economic martial law.
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:57.783]  The president can sign PDD 51 saying he's a dictator, saying whoever comes later as president's a dictator.
[00:09:57.783 --> 00:10:03.426]  He can sign the John Warner Defense Authorization Act to put battle-hardened brigades under homeland command in the U.S.
[00:10:03.426 --> 00:10:06.327]  against the American people two years ago and now it's happening.
[00:10:06.327 --> 00:10:18.474]  They can do all of this, but they still want the acquiescence of Congress, at least on paper, to say, see, they signed over totally unconstitutional criminal power, that's what it is, to
[00:10:19.955 --> 00:10:22.216]  The Treasury and the private bankers that run it.
[00:10:22.216 --> 00:10:27.378]  So this is the Federal Reserve basically taking over the Treasury Department fully.
[00:10:27.378 --> 00:10:32.819]  They already engage in manipulation, insider trading, and all sorts of corruption with our tax money through the banking system.
[00:10:32.819 --> 00:10:37.701]  But now, and in this new bill, it has unlimited fractional reserve banking.
[00:10:37.701 --> 00:10:40.542]  Let me explain.
[00:10:40.542 --> 00:10:44.983]  We got into trouble with the 10 to 1 rule.
[00:10:44.983 --> 00:10:49.205]  For every dollar in a bank, they can loan out 10 that don't exist.
[00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:53.351]  Because they could then set up subsidiaries and leverage out to infinity.
[00:10:53.351 --> 00:11:00.133]  Now, in the bill, in the subsections, it clearly states UNLIMITED!
[00:11:00.133 --> 00:11:09.216]  They can just make up whatever they want, any amount of fiat money, and give that to any private institution they wish, or buy anything they wish from themselves.
[00:11:09.216 --> 00:11:11.117]  Total conflict of interest with
[00:11:13.627 --> 00:11:33.338]  This small inner group of private Federal Reserve owning bankers, who own the 12 member banks, which is owned by the Bank of England, and that's why you see the British news, and that's why you see Gordon Brown, the Prime Minister, that's why you see German, and the French leaders saying it's the end, it's the end, global depression, road warrior scenario, they're all saying that, they've even used that term.
[00:11:36.522 --> 00:11:39.344]  I don't know who started using that decades ago, but it's now in popular use.
[00:11:39.344 --> 00:11:46.608]  They're saying, road warrior scenario, total breakdown of society, it's all over the news, unless you give the international banks total control.
[00:11:46.608 --> 00:11:52.492]  And so now the private banks will become the government, not just be separate from the government, issuing the currency and credit.
[00:11:52.492 --> 00:11:53.673]  They are taking over.
[00:11:53.673 --> 00:11:55.854]  They already took over in Europe and England a long time ago.
[00:11:55.854 --> 00:12:00.417]  They are taking over everything, and now they're going to put carbon taxes on us.
[00:12:00.897 --> 00:12:15.285]  I told you, as it's in the Club of Rome, and the CFR, and the Bilderberg minutes, and the documents, and the eyewitnesses, and the IMF and World Bank documents, that they want to have global carbon taxes you pay to the private global central banks, and guess what?
[00:12:15.285 --> 00:12:17.106]  That's in the bill!
[00:12:17.106 --> 00:12:23.770]  That's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:26.712]  Do you understand what is happening here?
[00:12:27.754 --> 00:12:32.237]  Everything we told you, exactly as we said, it would take place.
[00:12:32.237 --> 00:12:54.052]  Now, even in our own Liberty Movement, with the few hundred financial analysts and economists and people, the majority of them admit that the private central banks, because their documents are public, wanted to engineer a collapse, but they are saying, oh, but they've lost control of this.
[00:12:55.265 --> 00:12:58.571]  A minority of us see clearly that they haven't.
[00:12:58.571 --> 00:13:00.053]  This is planned.
[00:13:00.053 --> 00:13:06.344]  Again, we came and told you two and a half years ago, a year before the subprime thing even started, that they were going to implode it starting with that.
[00:13:06.344 --> 00:13:07.246]  That wasn't an accident.
[00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:09.591]  And we're not prescient.
[00:13:09.591 --> 00:13:12.752]  We're not giving you revelation here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:12.752 --> 00:13:14.032]  Divine revelation.
[00:13:14.032 --> 00:13:19.254]  We had moles inside and put it in articles and on video on record.
[00:13:19.254 --> 00:13:20.734]  You cannot argue with it.
[00:13:20.734 --> 00:13:21.835]  It's premeditated.
[00:13:21.835 --> 00:13:23.595]  We have the IMF and World Bank documents.
[00:13:23.595 --> 00:13:24.716]  Keep telling you that's a big deal.
[00:13:24.716 --> 00:13:27.137]  Every day on the show for six years since we got them.
[00:13:27.137 --> 00:13:29.377]  Because they said they're planning it here.
[00:13:29.377 --> 00:13:31.218]  The same stuff they've done in the third world.
[00:13:31.218 --> 00:13:35.380]  Take over the government, run up the debt, implode it, hand everything over to the bankers.
[00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.540]  End of huge middle classes.
[00:13:37.691 --> 00:13:44.575]  In first world nations, the only first world nation in South America and Central America was Argentina.
[00:13:44.575 --> 00:13:45.155]  No longer.
[00:13:45.155 --> 00:13:47.437]  Total third world.
[00:13:47.437 --> 00:13:52.080]  Brazil was approaching first world and got knocked down to third world by these people.
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:55.902]  All by design, all on the record.
[00:13:55.902 --> 00:14:01.165]  And then, they tell you that the economy's fine, they lie to you while they get everybody more leverage into debt.
[00:14:01.949 --> 00:14:16.116]  And then they suddenly pull the trigger and say, depression, depression, depression, knowing that that would then kill the markets and create total and complete non-trust of the people and that all confidence would be lost.
[00:14:16.116 --> 00:14:17.056]  It's over!
[00:14:17.056 --> 00:14:17.536]  It's over.
[00:14:17.536 --> 00:14:18.317]  You understand?
[00:14:18.317 --> 00:14:21.478]  They just need to get these new powers and it's over.
[00:14:21.478 --> 00:14:23.939]  They're gonna pull the plug completely.
[00:14:23.939 --> 00:14:29.322]  When they pass that bailout, ladies and gentlemen, it is a death sentence within two months.
[00:14:29.322 --> 00:14:30.462]  Maybe longer, but I doubt it.
[00:14:30.462 --> 00:14:31.443]  It may even be days.
[00:14:33.442 --> 00:14:37.905]  When they have that done, and when that is completed, that is it.
[00:14:37.905 --> 00:14:38.566]  You understand?
[00:14:38.566 --> 00:14:42.749]  The equivalent of financial Armageddon.
[00:14:42.749 --> 00:14:54.217]  The missiles, the financial missiles, the figurative missiles, to annihilate the middle class of the planet in Western Europe, Japan, the United States, Australia, Canada.
[00:14:54.217 --> 00:14:55.138]  It's gone.
[00:14:55.138 --> 00:14:55.778]  It's over.
[00:14:55.778 --> 00:14:59.121]  They've created hundreds and hundreds of times fiat
[00:15:00.649 --> 00:15:01.170]  We're good to go.
[00:15:18.095 --> 00:15:28.920]  The Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, who openly own the stock in these central banks, they are taking over the financial system, the stocks, the pension funds, they are taking it all.
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:29.840]  Do you read me?
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:38.684]  And they're going to hit you with unbelievable hyperinflation while there is depression and a contraction.
[00:15:38.684 --> 00:15:46.327]  You're going to have what I am coining, not stagflation where you just have markets contracting and sales imploding,
[00:15:47.248 --> 00:15:50.091]  And some joblessness, and then inflation.
[00:15:50.091 --> 00:15:56.497]  You're going to have hyper-inflationary stagflation.
[00:15:56.497 --> 00:16:02.142]  Hyper-stagflation.
[00:16:02.142 --> 00:16:04.684]  Hyper-stagflation.
[00:16:04.684 --> 00:16:05.565]  Get the term right!
[00:16:06.281 --> 00:16:08.383]  It's hyper stagflation.
[00:16:08.383 --> 00:16:10.764]  I've been having an economist on the last week saying, is that a good term?
[00:16:10.764 --> 00:16:12.145]  That's a perfect term.
[00:16:12.145 --> 00:16:14.027]  This is hyper stagflation.
[00:16:14.027 --> 00:16:19.090]  This is mega hyper stagflation.
[00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:25.015]  You're not going to have jobs, you're not going to be able to get money, even as it takes 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100 times more money to buy stuff.
[00:16:25.015 --> 00:16:26.055]  You read me, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:33.524 --> 00:16:42.834]  Hyperinflation is devastating, even when people got money in the streets, and you know, suddenly you're not paid $30,000 a year, you're paid $100,000 because of inflation.
[00:16:42.834 --> 00:16:46.658]  Or you're not paid $100,000, you're paid a million dollars a year.
[00:16:46.658 --> 00:16:48.360]  But you can't buy what you need with it.
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:54.767]  No, you're not going to be able to have the paper, you're not going to have the credit, and they're going to be inflating prices.
[00:16:54.767 --> 00:16:55.348]  You got me?
[00:16:59.992 --> 00:17:12.210]  Inflation's at over 15% a year right now, and because there's been so much depression in the real economy and on Main Street, that's actually held some of the commodities down a little bit because there isn't a big a demand for fuel.
[00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:14.033]  People don't have money to buy gold.
[00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:15.495]  People don't have money to buy silver.
[00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:21.472]  But that equation is now shifting.
[00:17:21.472 --> 00:17:22.513]  Now here's the big news.
[00:17:22.513 --> 00:17:24.813]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:17:24.813 --> 00:17:28.254]  Martial law will be declared if banker bailout not passed.
[00:17:28.254 --> 00:17:32.895]  InfoWars.com.
[00:17:32.895 --> 00:17:34.935]  In-house debate on the banker rescue bill.
[00:17:34.935 --> 00:17:47.838]  Representative Brad Sherman told his fellow Congress critters that the government will declare martial law and the stock market will drop 3,000 points if the bill is not passed.
[00:17:49.375 --> 00:17:56.642]  The panic mongers were to the point of telling people the market would drop 3,000 points and there would be martial law, said Sherman.
[00:17:56.642 --> 00:18:03.428]  Sherman's comment was not in the same context as the comment issued by Representative Michael Burgess, who we interviewed on Monday.
[00:18:03.428 --> 00:18:10.875]  Earlier in the week, Burgess, who appeared on the Alex Jones Show, said Pelosi threatened to invoke House rule
[00:18:13.453 --> 00:18:20.720]  13-6A described as martial law intended to suspend normal procedures and safeguards unless all the House leadership to operate in a more authoritarian fashion.
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:24.884]  Sherman, however, said martial law would be declared on Wall Street, not in the House.
[00:18:24.884 --> 00:18:25.885]  And we've talked to his office.
[00:18:25.885 --> 00:18:26.786]  They confirmed it.
[00:18:26.786 --> 00:18:28.647]  He's coming on later.
[00:18:28.647 --> 00:18:32.631]  They're debating right now, but he's going to run in for about 20 minutes with us in between debate.
[00:18:32.631 --> 00:18:33.912]  Representative Sherman said the
[00:18:35.308 --> 00:18:44.433]  Exaggerated fear-mongering turned out not to be true, and the House can draft a good bill regardless of the pressure put on representatives to pass the Banker Bailout Bill.
[00:18:44.433 --> 00:18:50.496]  The bailout plan is not only economic fascism, as Richard Vigery has correctly noted,
[00:18:51.872 --> 00:19:00.255]  designed to loop the US Treasury and reorganize further consolidated elite control over the economy, but it's also a brazen effort to impose a martial law dictatorship.
[00:19:00.255 --> 00:19:07.618]  Paulson's role as financial dictator, not answerable to Congress and the American people, fully complements additional steps taken over the last few years.
[00:19:07.618 --> 00:19:11.320]  And Kurt Nemo goes through it all.
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:18.583]  Let's call Hamburg, former Congressman Hamburg, he's been warning about this in 2007, in the San Francisco Chronicle, about their plan for martial law.
[00:19:20.396 --> 00:19:22.799]  When I come back, I'm gonna play the clip, finish up the article.
[00:19:22.799 --> 00:19:26.583]  This is a absolute highest level alert.
[00:19:26.583 --> 00:19:30.127]  Get this out to everyone now so they know what's really happening.
[00:19:30.127 --> 00:19:31.389]  Full-scale emergency!
[00:19:31.389 --> 00:19:35.313]  You invest, you buy insurance, you wear your seatbelt, you do things to ensure...
[00:19:35.333 --> 00:19:35.573]  I think so.
[00:19:52.805 --> 00:19:55.806]  Products for pet care, your car, home, office and school.
[00:19:55.806 --> 00:20:00.287]  Protect against all natural disasters and terror attacks that can happen at any time.
[00:20:00.287 --> 00:20:04.048]  If you are not prepared, the last place you want to be is standing in FEMA lines.
[00:20:04.048 --> 00:20:05.969]  Invest in your future now.

[00:20:28.796 --> 00:20:31.517]  Prepare for tomorrow now.
[00:20:31.517 --> 00:20:34.738]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[00:20:34.738 --> 00:20:38.219]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:20:38.219 --> 00:20:40.860]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:42.400]  But who is the enemy?
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.201]  Bin Laden.
[00:20:43.201 --> 00:20:44.181]  This is his ammo.
[00:20:44.181 --> 00:20:45.582]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:20:45.582 --> 00:20:47.022]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:20:47.543 --> 00:20:54.710]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:55.191]  Some U.S.
[00:20:55.191 --> 00:21:01.558]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:21:01.558 --> 00:21:05.002]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:21:05.242 --> 00:21:15.507]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:21:15.507 --> 00:21:16.747]  Fabled enemies.
[00:21:16.747 --> 00:21:24.491]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:21:24.491 --> 00:21:27.853]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:21:31.277 --> 00:21:32.337]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:32.337 --> 00:21:37.278]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:21:37.278 --> 00:21:45.340]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:50.921]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:21:50.921 --> 00:21:57.883]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:21:58.203 --> 00:22:03.787]  A current effort is underway by the Fed, along with other central banks, to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:22:03.787 --> 00:22:08.870]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:16.455]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:22:16.795 --> 00:22:23.358]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:22:23.358 --> 00:22:27.219]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:27.219 --> 00:22:27.639]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:27.639 --> 00:22:33.182]  High gasoline prices got you down?
[00:22:33.182 --> 00:22:36.103]  Is your vehicle not getting the mileage it used to?
[00:22:36.103 --> 00:22:41.785]  Poor quality gasoline and the addition of ethanol plugs your fuel injectors and slowly robs fuel economy.
[00:22:41.785 --> 00:22:45.407]  Mechanics charge up to $300 to clean your fuel system.
[00:22:45.407 --> 00:22:45.967]  Save your money.

[00:23:23.418 --> 00:23:24.739]  Continuing with the article by Kurt Nemo.
[00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:44.734]  Even people in our own movement don't understand this is completely engineered.
[00:23:44.734 --> 00:23:48.557]  They love to think of the elite as bumbling buffoons.
[00:23:48.557 --> 00:23:50.899]  No, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:50.899 --> 00:23:57.365]  They've created genetically engineered crops to take over all the other major food lines and infect the entire biosphere.
[00:23:57.365 --> 00:24:01.868]  They've developed weapons where they can shoot missiles down your chimney and kill your family.
[00:24:01.868 --> 00:24:03.490]  They control the central banking system.
[00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:04.851]  They got control of the world.
[00:24:06.721 --> 00:24:12.743]  In a huge fight between all the hundreds of thousands of tyrants and thugs throughout modern history.
[00:24:12.743 --> 00:24:16.905]  They are the New World Order and they are engineering this in their own words.
[00:24:16.905 --> 00:24:20.346]  They have been preparing for martial law, for economic martial law.
[00:24:20.346 --> 00:24:21.686]  They have been gearing up.
[00:24:21.686 --> 00:24:24.507]  They have been quietly paying off local politicians.
[00:24:24.507 --> 00:24:28.589]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is happening.
[00:24:28.589 --> 00:24:32.050]  Let's just go ahead and play the video, the audio here on air for everybody.
[00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:33.410]  The video is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:24:35.439 --> 00:24:39.362]  This is Representative Brad Sherman about physical martial law.
[00:24:39.362 --> 00:24:44.826]  They were threatened with martial law Monday if they didn't pass the bailout plan.
[00:24:44.826 --> 00:24:47.388]  See, financial terrorism!
[00:24:47.388 --> 00:24:58.055]  We're gonna have a depression and there's gonna be martial law if you don't pass this and they blinked and the globalists... The Congress didn't blink and the globalists blinked and backed off.
[00:24:58.055 --> 00:25:01.318]  Now they've had time to terrorize the public for another four or five days
[00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:05.091]  That both parties tell you, you've got to do this.
[00:25:05.091 --> 00:25:07.832]  And it isn't about the 800 million, it's really 5 trillion.
[00:25:07.832 --> 00:25:10.833]  First it's 700, now 800, now they're saying 5 trillion.
[00:25:10.833 --> 00:25:15.054]  It's the unlimited power that the bankers get.
[00:25:15.054 --> 00:25:15.974]  Go ahead and play the clip.
[00:25:15.974 --> 00:25:18.695]  This is last night, during debate.
[00:25:18.695 --> 00:25:21.016]  This is last night, and this is still going on.
[00:25:21.016 --> 00:25:22.856]  Similar comments this morning are coming in.
[00:25:22.856 --> 00:25:23.897]  Here it is.
[00:25:23.897 --> 00:25:25.497]  ...city from Ohio.
[00:25:25.497 --> 00:25:31.199]  The only way they can pass this bill is by creating and sustaining a panic atmosphere.
[00:25:31.852 --> 00:25:35.155]  That atmosphere is not justified.
[00:25:35.155 --> 00:25:56.211]  Many of us were told in private conversations that if we voted against this bill on Monday, that the sky would fall, the market would drop two or three thousand points the first day, another couple thousand the second day, and a few members were even told that there would be martial law in America if we voted no.
[00:25:56.211 --> 00:25:57.852]  That's what I call fear-mongering.
[00:25:58.656 --> 00:25:59.997]  Unjustified.
[00:25:59.997 --> 00:26:01.378]  Proven wrong.
[00:26:01.378 --> 00:26:05.121]  We've got a week, we've got two weeks, to write a good bill.
[00:26:05.121 --> 00:26:09.844]  The only way to write, to pass a bad bill, keep the panic pressure on.
[00:26:09.844 --> 00:26:13.487]  Now, what has the Senate done to this bill?
[00:26:13.487 --> 00:26:19.851]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, they fear-mongered and said, you never see big officials say this.
[00:26:19.851 --> 00:26:20.512]  Ever.
[00:26:20.512 --> 00:26:20.972]  Never.
[00:26:20.972 --> 00:26:22.713]  They said there will be a depression.
[00:26:22.713 --> 00:26:23.654]  And 1,200,000,000 plus billion, 1.23,
[00:26:27.322 --> 00:26:42.225]  One trillion two hundred billion point three was lost in two hours after the no vote before the stock exchange closed on the Dow Jones alone.
[00:26:42.225 --> 00:26:47.166]  It's incalculable the other markets around the world and the other indexes.
[00:26:47.166 --> 00:26:53.428]  Now, that is terrorism of the highest order.
[00:26:53.428 --> 00:26:54.188]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:26:55.620 --> 00:27:00.763]  That is close to half the money spent in the Iraq War.
[00:27:00.763 --> 00:27:07.587]  That is close to half the GDP gross domestic product of the country in a year.
[00:27:07.587 --> 00:27:10.028]  GONE!
[00:27:10.028 --> 00:27:19.013]  And then these bastards sit up there and tell you they're your savior and give them unlimited power.
[00:27:19.013 --> 00:27:20.794]  A lot of you denied they carried out 9-11.
[00:27:20.794 --> 00:27:21.894]  You couldn't deal with that.
[00:27:21.894 --> 00:27:22.755]  You couldn't face it.
[00:27:23.348 --> 00:27:26.730]  They'll kill 3,000 of us and they'll steal a trillion too.
[00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:31.174]  They'll burn it down in front of you just to scare you.
[00:27:31.174 --> 00:27:34.216]  And it hasn't gained hardly any of that back.
[00:27:34.216 --> 00:27:41.281]  Now, if they pass this and they get these economic powers, they're going to pump things up for a few months.
[00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:47.091]  Maybe even six months, and then they are going to completely enslave everybody.
[00:27:47.091 --> 00:27:48.192]  In fact, they don't even care right now.
[00:27:48.192 --> 00:27:49.012]  They're going for broke.
[00:27:49.012 --> 00:27:50.152]  They're not even hiding it.
[00:27:50.152 --> 00:27:54.113]  They'll probably pass it and have a depression two weeks later.
[00:27:54.113 --> 00:27:55.694]  And then they'll say it isn't a depression.
[00:27:55.694 --> 00:28:00.635]  They'll go back to saying everything's great while everybody's rioting and starving in the streets.
[00:28:00.635 --> 00:28:10.918]  What are you gonna do, police, when people are rioting and starving, and then your mama's calling from a state over, or a city nearby, begging you to come help her?
[00:28:10.918 --> 00:28:11.518]  You're gonna leave.
[00:28:12.392 --> 00:28:13.934]  You're gonna go help your mama, or maybe you won't.
[00:28:13.934 --> 00:28:18.858]  Maybe like Richard, the head of the county that, uh, the parish that, uh, New Orleans is in.
[00:28:18.858 --> 00:28:22.402]  The feds told him to stand down for five days while his mama called him.
[00:28:22.402 --> 00:28:24.904]  Dig that clip up!
[00:28:24.904 --> 00:28:25.705]  It's Richard.
[00:28:25.705 --> 00:28:26.926]  I forget, it was like three years ago.
[00:28:26.926 --> 00:28:30.829]  I forget the name of the exact clip, but we played it a lot.
[00:28:30.829 --> 00:28:31.730]  Just see if you can, John.
[00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:34.393]  I might find it on Google.
[00:28:34.393 --> 00:28:35.454]  It's parish sheriff.
[00:28:38.777 --> 00:28:41.459]  Talks about lack of federal aid or something like that.
[00:28:41.459 --> 00:28:47.222]  Him crying on Good Morning America saying the Feds held him back and Mama called and said, Honey, there's water in here.
[00:28:47.222 --> 00:28:48.063]  I'm in the nursing home.
[00:28:48.063 --> 00:28:48.643]  There's no food.
[00:28:48.643 --> 00:28:49.423]  There's no power.
[00:28:49.423 --> 00:28:50.244]  Help me.
[00:28:50.244 --> 00:28:51.405]  They said, I'm coming, Mama.
[00:28:51.405 --> 00:28:52.826]  I'm coming.
[00:28:52.826 --> 00:28:54.086]  And the Feds said he couldn't go help her.
[00:28:54.086 --> 00:28:56.007]  And the next day, I'm going to follow my orders, Mama.
[00:28:56.007 --> 00:28:56.448]  I'm coming.
[00:28:56.448 --> 00:28:57.068]  I'm coming.
[00:28:57.068 --> 00:28:58.349]  The next day, Mama, I'm coming.
[00:28:58.349 --> 00:28:59.490]  Mama, I'm coming.
[00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:01.010]  The Feds said no, he couldn't go help her.
[00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:03.692]  And then on the fourth day, Mama, I'm coming.
[00:29:03.692 --> 00:29:04.353]  Mama, I'm coming.
[00:29:04.353 --> 00:29:04.813]  I'm going to help you.
[00:29:04.813 --> 00:29:06.594]  On the fifth day, Mama was dead.
[00:29:07.819 --> 00:29:10.041]  Just remember that, police!
[00:29:10.041 --> 00:29:11.262]  Just remember!
[00:29:11.262 --> 00:29:14.526]  And I know your black uniform is more important than your mama!
[00:29:14.526 --> 00:29:21.532]  I know you're evil!
[00:29:21.532 --> 00:29:22.914]  We're on the march.
[00:29:22.914 --> 00:29:25.436]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:25.436 --> 00:29:28.139]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:29:54.694 --> 00:29:57.435]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[00:29:57.435 --> 00:29:59.556]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[00:29:59.556 --> 00:30:00.536]  this fall?
[00:30:00.536 --> 00:30:01.456]  Don't wait.

[00:30:44.501 --> 00:30:48.327]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.

[00:31:31.258 --> 00:31:41.246]  Cameras are everywhere, above stoplights, on toll booths, and scanning the freeways just waiting to snap a photo of your license plate, only to slam you with ridiculous fines.
[00:31:41.246 --> 00:31:44.849]  In California, red light tickets are as high as $400.

[00:32:20.873 --> 00:32:21.333]  That's 800-276-9601 today.
[00:32:21.333 --> 00:32:22.755]  Don't give your money to the state.
[00:32:22.755 --> 00:32:23.596]  Spray your plate!
[00:32:48.753 --> 00:32:49.196]  Get on
[00:33:40.902 --> 00:33:41.703]  I hope so.
[00:34:59.244 --> 00:35:10.235]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm late getting back on air because I was just on the phone with Ron Paul's office battling to get him on today to comment on this martial law development.
[00:35:10.235 --> 00:35:22.687]  Open discussions, Congress people being told physical martial law will be declared if they don't sign over financial martial law powers to the private bankers through Secretary Criminal Paulson.
[00:35:23.982 --> 00:35:25.823]  And he said he'll probably be able to get Ron Paul.
[00:35:25.823 --> 00:35:27.604]  The debate is going on now.
[00:35:27.604 --> 00:35:31.526]  If they can do it, Ron Paul is coming up.
[00:35:31.526 --> 00:35:37.168]  Then we've got Paul Craig Roberts in 54 minutes coming on.
[00:35:37.168 --> 00:35:42.971]  We've got former Congressman Dan Hamburg who predicted all of this last year in the San Francisco Chronicle with a detailed report.
[00:35:42.971 --> 00:35:46.873]  We're linked to up in InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and Curt Nemo's story.
[00:35:47.771 --> 00:35:49.132]  And then, the big one.
[00:35:49.132 --> 00:35:50.492]  Congressman Brad Sherman.
[00:35:50.492 --> 00:35:56.195]  We're going to find out exactly who told him for this martial law.
[00:35:56.195 --> 00:35:56.916]  Oh my God.
[00:35:56.916 --> 00:35:58.316]  I mean, this is insane.
[00:35:58.316 --> 00:36:02.659]  I mean, so much is happening.
[00:36:02.659 --> 00:36:08.522]  Go ahead and play the Brad Sherman clip again for people that don't have computers, that can't go to InfoWars.com and watch the video of it.
[00:36:08.522 --> 00:36:09.442]  Here's the audio today.
[00:36:11.815 --> 00:36:18.178]  The only way they can pass this bill is by creating and sustaining a panic atmosphere.
[00:36:18.178 --> 00:36:21.479]  That atmosphere is not justified.
[00:36:21.479 --> 00:36:41.287]  Many of us were told in private conversations that if we voted against this bill on Monday, that the sky would fall, the market would drop two or three thousand points the first day, another couple thousand the second day, and a few members were even told that there would be martial law in America if we voted no.
[00:36:42.521 --> 00:36:44.982]  That's what I call fear-mongering.
[00:36:44.982 --> 00:36:46.322]  Unjustified.
[00:36:46.322 --> 00:36:47.682]  Proven wrong.
[00:36:47.682 --> 00:36:51.443]  We've got a week, we've got two weeks to write a good bill.
[00:36:51.443 --> 00:36:56.165]  The only way to write, to pass a bad bill, keep the panic pressure on.
[00:36:56.165 --> 00:36:59.085]  Now what has the Senate done to this bill?
[00:36:59.085 --> 00:37:01.666]  And then he goes into hell and hands dictatorial power over.
[00:37:03.371 --> 00:37:05.713]  To the private treasury, and it's basically private.
[00:37:05.713 --> 00:37:08.636]  It operates as a private operation with the private Federal Reserve.
[00:37:08.636 --> 00:37:11.579]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is red level.
[00:37:11.579 --> 00:37:15.903]  They are creating a false threat to the economy, terrorizing the world markets.
[00:37:15.903 --> 00:37:20.748]  A trillion, two hundred billion and change lost in one day from their terrorism.
[00:37:20.748 --> 00:37:24.111]  They're engaging in the same terrorism all week, driving world markets down.
[00:37:26.448 --> 00:37:29.629]  Other congressmen on record have said they've been threatened with martial law.
[00:37:29.629 --> 00:37:32.651]  If they try to impeach, if they say no to this, it's all on record.
[00:37:32.651 --> 00:37:37.673]  There's so many accounts of this, we can't even, in this morning, putting the story together, add them all in there!
[00:37:37.673 --> 00:37:39.033]  Physically write them all down!
[00:37:39.033 --> 00:37:41.775]  There's too many!
[00:37:41.775 --> 00:37:46.036]  We need our volunteers to go into the Prison Planet Forum and find all the mainstream articles.
[00:37:46.036 --> 00:37:47.797]  All the other congressmen.
[00:37:47.797 --> 00:37:48.577]  Who were the two?
[00:37:48.577 --> 00:37:50.158]  It was earlier this year.
[00:37:50.158 --> 00:37:54.320]  With all this craziness going on, I only had five minutes this morning to look for it, because I was working on some other stuff.
[00:37:56.581 --> 00:37:58.883]  Because I want to add it to Nemo's story.
[00:37:58.883 --> 00:38:03.648]  There were two East Coast congressmen and people would go to their public rallies and there's video of it and audio.
[00:38:03.648 --> 00:38:06.691]  And the congressman was asked, why aren't you going for impeachment?
[00:38:06.691 --> 00:38:10.575]  And two separate congressmen said, because we've been threatened with martial law if we do.
[00:38:10.575 --> 00:38:12.977]  They'll launch an attack on Iran as a pretext for martial law.
[00:38:14.938 --> 00:38:17.581]  I mean, this is it, ladies and gentlemen!
[00:38:17.581 --> 00:38:19.843]  We need to create a real panic.
[00:38:19.843 --> 00:38:21.544]  People should be panicked over this.
[00:38:21.544 --> 00:38:23.025]  Panicked calling Congress.
[00:38:23.025 --> 00:38:24.767]  Panicked calling the White House.
[00:38:24.767 --> 00:38:26.849]  Panicked calling the news media.
[00:38:26.849 --> 00:38:28.751]  Acting like this is a big deal.
[00:38:28.751 --> 00:38:30.512]  Not just calmly taking it.
[00:38:30.512 --> 00:38:35.437]  See, they use our normal instinct to stand up and fight back against this, and they say,
[00:38:37.108 --> 00:38:45.069]  You better panic and go for total dictatorship, financial power, for the Treasury and the Private Fellow Reserve, or you're going to lose everything.
[00:38:45.069 --> 00:38:47.410]  That is an incredible crime!
[00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:49.350]  What we're saying is, no!
[00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:51.550]  Stop saying the emergency's that bad!
[00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:53.551]  Stop worsening it!
[00:38:53.551 --> 00:38:57.531]  Stop trying to get dictatorial powers by destroying the markets!
[00:38:57.531 --> 00:39:00.652]  Things could still probably be fixed.
[00:39:00.652 --> 00:39:05.273]  All the economists we've had on have said that, but what they're doing is the opposite, will only make it worse.
[00:39:05.273 --> 00:39:06.233]  They know that!
[00:39:06.937 --> 00:39:10.942]  They're bankrupting everything on purpose!
[00:39:10.942 --> 00:39:14.526]  We are at the key crossroads right now!
[00:39:14.526 --> 00:39:17.589]  I need this story on InfoWars.com.
[00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:23.896]  And I need more detailed ones on PrisonPlanet.com to go mega viral like it never has before.
[00:39:25.177 --> 00:39:30.538]  And I need my web people, my IT guys, to stay on the servers because I know they're smoking right now.
[00:39:30.538 --> 00:39:34.499]  We have to keep InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com up.
[00:39:34.499 --> 00:39:36.060]  We've been getting so much traffic.
[00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:40.341]  We've had all sorts of problems the last few weeks as this intensifies.
[00:39:40.341 --> 00:39:43.362]  That's why I tried to beef up our servers before this came.
[00:39:43.362 --> 00:39:45.382]  That's why I've been trying to get more servers.
[00:39:45.382 --> 00:39:47.423]  We can't screw around.
[00:39:47.423 --> 00:39:51.744]  You understand we are entering the danger zone right now.
[00:39:51.744 --> 00:39:52.964]  I want to settle down and
[00:39:53.783 --> 00:40:00.824]  Reconvene my thoughts here and go through everything that's happening and talk about what we're currently witnessing in a calm fashion.
[00:40:00.824 --> 00:40:03.505]  Speaking of the devil, pull up Danger Zone for me.
[00:40:03.505 --> 00:40:06.265]  Corny 80s song, but I think it says it all.
[00:40:06.265 --> 00:40:07.766]  Cue up Danger Zone for me, Johnny.
[00:40:07.766 --> 00:40:08.986]  Take a couple minute break here.
[00:40:08.986 --> 00:40:10.306]  I just can't.
[00:40:10.306 --> 00:40:15.427]  I'm starting to hyperventilate because I know how real this is.
[00:40:15.427 --> 00:40:18.408]  You know, I have a guardian spirit.
[00:40:18.408 --> 00:40:20.588]  I have a mindset of guardianship.
[00:40:22.907 --> 00:40:32.617]  And driving into work this morning, I saw women, you know, pushing their baby carriages, going up to the bus stops, taking them to the daycare to work.
[00:40:32.617 --> 00:40:43.628]  And, you know, in the past, say 10 years ago, I'd look at a beautiful woman or something and think, man, she's, you know, good looking and you'll be lustful.
[00:40:46.033 --> 00:40:52.478]  And then, in the last ten years or so, I just got to where I admired beautiful women and, you know, people.
[00:40:52.478 --> 00:40:59.182]  And now I just look at men and women and children and everybody and just my heart literally burns with love.
[00:40:59.182 --> 00:41:00.463]  And I just want to protect them.
[00:41:00.463 --> 00:41:03.906]  And I don't even hate them because they're ignorant and silly and don't know what's going on.
[00:41:03.906 --> 00:41:05.647]  I've been brainwashed since birth.
[00:41:05.647 --> 00:41:10.410]  And I just burned with passion to warn them and to save them and to help them.
[00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:12.292]  And I don't have the strength to do it.
[00:41:12.292 --> 00:41:13.873]  And that's why I blow up on air.
[00:41:13.873 --> 00:41:15.514]  Because I don't, I'm not even
[00:41:17.364 --> 00:41:19.647]  I'm not even the way I was three or four years ago, folks.
[00:41:19.647 --> 00:41:22.730]  I don't even think about sex anymore.
[00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:25.333]  I don't even think about food anymore, hardly.
[00:41:25.333 --> 00:41:28.276]  I don't even think about anything but fighting the New World Order.
[00:41:28.276 --> 00:41:29.397]  That's all I think about.
[00:41:29.397 --> 00:41:30.298]  That's all I do.
[00:41:30.298 --> 00:41:31.179]  That's all I am.
[00:41:32.077 --> 00:41:32.978]  I see the evil.
[00:41:32.978 --> 00:41:34.539]  My mind's constantly working.
[00:41:34.539 --> 00:41:35.479]  I know the angles.
[00:41:35.479 --> 00:41:40.983]  I look at the simplest things and see 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 layers of depth into them.
[00:41:40.983 --> 00:41:42.704]  I've got incredible discernment now.
[00:41:42.704 --> 00:41:48.689]  It just gets more intense all the time, and I don't have the intellect to even articulate it.
[00:41:48.689 --> 00:41:50.170]  I just know that it's horrible.
[00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:50.790]  It's real.
[00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:51.911]  Martial law.
[00:41:51.911 --> 00:41:52.691]  FEMA camps.
[00:41:52.691 --> 00:41:53.612]  Death.
[00:41:53.612 --> 00:41:56.574]  And I look at all these good people, and I want to save them!
[00:41:56.574 --> 00:41:57.675]  Not just my family!
[00:42:00.999 --> 00:42:03.140]  I want to save those women with those babies!
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:04.901]  I want to save these dumb cops!
[00:42:04.901 --> 00:42:12.605]  I want to save these dumb low-level bankers and minions and city council people that think they're part of the elite and don't know they're getting set up to be taken down!
[00:42:12.605 --> 00:42:19.908]  I don't know how to... I am just... I don't know why I'm even talking about myself and my mindset.
[00:42:19.908 --> 00:42:25.351]  I just wish other people burned with the same passion and the same brotherly love.
[00:42:25.351 --> 00:42:27.392]  No, I don't want to play that song, actually.
[00:42:27.392 --> 00:42:27.792]  Let's play...
[00:42:28.963 --> 00:42:32.025]  Let's play part of it and then we'll play... Get top ranking.
[00:42:32.025 --> 00:42:34.246]  I wanna play top ranking.
[00:42:34.246 --> 00:42:38.289]  Because liberal, conservative, black, white, old, young, everybody, we gotta drop all of it.
[00:42:38.289 --> 00:42:41.511]  We gotta get serious and focused and positive.
[00:42:41.511 --> 00:42:44.752]  And positive means admitting how bad things are so we can fix it.
[00:42:44.752 --> 00:42:48.415]  Not this new age, positive stuff of denying what's going on.
[00:42:48.415 --> 00:42:49.615]  And magical thinking.
[00:42:49.615 --> 00:42:51.416]  That isn't gonna dig us out of this!
[00:42:51.416 --> 00:42:55.679]  We gotta get fired up and focused and take action and beat these people!
[00:42:56.331 --> 00:43:05.798]  Because the bare minimum, they're going to take everything you've got and make you dispossess people like in Argentina or Nigeria.
[00:43:05.798 --> 00:43:09.340]  And let me tell you, it's a horrible prison economy they're going to set up.
[00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:15.765]  A predatory thing that makes all the tasering and deaths and millions in prison look like nothing!
[00:43:15.765 --> 00:43:17.126]  Here it is, top ranking.
[00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:31.001]  Yeah.
[00:44:23.830 --> 00:44:24.254]  Yeah.
[00:44:45.666 --> 00:44:48.167]  I feel that love this morning.
[00:45:26.827 --> 00:45:30.409]  Keep on killin' one another!
[00:45:55.094 --> 00:45:59.196]  Rise against the New World Order!
[00:45:59.196 --> 00:46:00.897]  Turn on the light!
[00:46:00.897 --> 00:46:03.398]  Push the darkness from the room!
[00:46:03.398 --> 00:46:09.941]  But only you can flip on that light switch!
[00:46:09.941 --> 00:46:12.102]  It's within your grasp!
[00:46:12.102 --> 00:46:18.585]  And make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen, we are in the Danger Zone!
[00:46:18.585 --> 00:46:20.366]  Here it is, realize it, and hey!
[00:46:21.098 --> 00:46:23.683]  Closer to the edge, the higher the intensity.
[00:46:23.683 --> 00:46:24.744]  Here it is!
[00:47:17.668 --> 00:47:19.476]  Shove it into overdrive!
[00:47:47.619 --> 00:47:48.859]  You don't know what you can do till you get on that edge.
[00:47:48.859 --> 00:47:49.839]  Whether you like it or not, we're all on the edge.
[00:47:49.839 --> 00:47:50.159]  Heaven above us.
[00:47:50.159 --> 00:47:50.380]  Hell below.
[00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:50.780]  The choice is yours.
[00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:51.400]  You can break your conditioning.
[00:48:20.503 --> 00:48:23.850]  You can break the spell of the New World Order!
[00:48:23.850 --> 00:48:28.180]  Make no mistake, it's spiritual!
[00:48:58.883 --> 00:49:08.547]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, coming up, Ron Paul, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Congressman Dan Hamburg, Congressman Brad Sherman.
[00:49:08.547 --> 00:49:11.028]  They are threatening Congress with martial law.
[00:49:11.028 --> 00:49:17.291]  The last time they wouldn't pass the Patriot Act, the White House hit them with an anthrax attack.
[00:49:17.291 --> 00:49:22.213]  Pray for Congress!
[00:49:22.213 --> 00:49:24.814]  And even if they're able to pass this banker takeover bill.
[00:49:27.279 --> 00:49:34.684]  We can still expose who are the culprits, who carried out the financial terrorism and did it in front of everybody.
[00:49:34.684 --> 00:49:42.570]  You let your voices be heard now on talk radio, the internet, letters to the editor, calls to the media, signs on the streets.
[00:49:44.241 --> 00:49:50.284]  By going and getting the stories up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and getting it out to everybody aggressively.
[00:49:50.284 --> 00:49:59.930]  This can become the biggest story on the internet, breaking into the mainstream media, and it will force investigations, and it will come out that they are threatening and preparing martial law!
[00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:08.214]  We have got to defend the gates as the enemy comes against us right now!
[00:50:08.214 --> 00:50:09.615]  This is it!
[00:50:09.615 --> 00:50:12.016]  This is the beginning of a real war!
[00:50:14.146 --> 00:50:16.268]  All our labor warning people.
[00:50:16.268 --> 00:50:18.869]  All our labor telling people who the real enemy is.
[00:50:18.869 --> 00:50:21.651]  All our labor exposing the enemy.
[00:50:21.651 --> 00:50:25.713]  Now in the coming months and days we'll be brought to the test.

[00:50:42.032 --> 00:50:44.294]  Teach them to be aware of their surroundings.
[00:50:44.294 --> 00:50:47.016]  Walk on well-lit paths with friends or students.
[00:50:47.016 --> 00:50:50.019]  Secure the windows and doors of their dorm room or apartment.
[00:50:50.019 --> 00:50:51.940]  Know how to reach campus security.

[00:51:26.212 --> 00:51:34.476]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[00:51:34.476 --> 00:51:37.978]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:51:37.978 --> 00:51:40.599]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:51:40.599 --> 00:51:42.160]  But who is the enemy?
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:42.940]  Bin Laden.
[00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:43.860]  This is his MO.
[00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:45.341]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:51:45.341 --> 00:51:46.942]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:51:47.302 --> 00:51:54.448]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:51:54.448 --> 00:51:54.929]  Some U.S.
[00:51:54.929 --> 00:52:01.294]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:01.294 --> 00:52:04.737]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:04.997 --> 00:52:15.263]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:52:15.263 --> 00:52:16.484]  Fabled enemies.

[00:52:44.449 --> 00:52:50.815]  Or confidence because you knew what was coming and got prepared with PatriotFood.com?
[00:52:50.815 --> 00:52:52.677]  The signs are everywhere.

[00:52:59.643 --> 00:53:05.087]  What good is it to know the truth about any conspiracy unless you take action?

[00:53:42.809 --> 00:53:47.131]  It'll build the death planes.
[00:53:47.131 --> 00:53:51.532]  It'll build all the bombs.
[00:53:51.532 --> 00:53:54.053]  It'll hide behind walls.
[00:53:54.053 --> 00:53:55.854]  Hide behind desks.
[00:53:55.854 --> 00:53:57.655]  It'll hide behind desks.
[00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:30.451]  You that never done nothin' You that never done nothin' Put a belt to destroy You play with my world Like it's your little toy You put a gun in my hand And you hide from my eyes
[00:54:32.646 --> 00:55:01.985]  You turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly Like a Judas of old You lie and deceive A world war can be won You want me to believe But I see through your eyes And I see through you
[00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:10.003]  Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.
[00:55:10.003 --> 00:55:21.989]  You fasten all the triggers before the others to fire.
[00:55:21.989 --> 00:55:30.594]  And then you step back and watch when the death count gets higher.
[00:55:32.729 --> 00:55:58.824]  You hide in your mansion While the young people's blood Flows out of their bodies and it's buried in the mud You've thrown the worst fear That can ever be hurled For you to bring children
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:26.795]  Before threatening my baby Unborn and unnamed You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins How much do I know?
[00:56:26.795 --> 00:56:33.320]  But you talk out of turn You must say that I'm young
[00:56:35.473 --> 00:56:57.042]  You might say I'm unlearned But there's one thing I know I'm younger than you Even Jesus would never forgive what you do Let me ask you one question
[00:57:08.185 --> 00:57:12.549]  Do you think that it could?
[00:57:12.549 --> 00:57:29.521]  I think you will find When your death takes its toll All the money you've made will never buy back your soul And I hope that you die
[00:57:42.023 --> 00:57:43.944]  Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:43.944 --> 00:57:46.264]  Absolutely couldn't say it better than Bob Dylan.
[00:57:46.264 --> 00:57:50.105]  And let me just tell you, Bob Dylan knows all about the New World Order.
[00:57:50.105 --> 00:57:54.026]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:57:54.026 --> 00:57:58.188]  How could you write a song like that and not know?
[00:57:58.188 --> 00:58:01.408]  But I do know.
[00:58:01.408 --> 00:58:02.949]  And so do you.

[00:58:31.490 --> 00:58:34.372]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:58:34.372 --> 00:58:40.117]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:58:40.117 --> 00:58:47.664]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door!
[00:58:47.664 --> 00:58:52.588]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:59:00.404 --> 00:59:03.987]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:59:03.987 --> 00:59:06.468]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.

[01:00:07.362 --> 01:00:11.645]  Congressman Ron Paul is being lined up for the show right now, sometime in the next three hours.
[01:00:11.645 --> 01:00:17.669]  Congressman Dan Hamburg is going to be on, concerning the story we're about to cover, coming up in an hour and a half.
[01:00:17.669 --> 01:00:26.796]  And then we have Congressman Brad Sherman, central to the story we're reporting on, joining us as well, coming up in the middle of the fourth hour today.
[01:00:27.416 --> 01:00:30.300]  One of the most important, if not the most important transmission ever.
[01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:41.312]  No doubt more important transmissions will be coming in the near future as the clash between free humanity and those that are on the side of goodness and the light fight against darkness.
[01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:49.653]  Huge story up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com right now.
[01:00:49.653 --> 01:00:53.776]  Martial law will be declared if banker bailout not passed in-house.
[01:00:53.776 --> 01:00:56.778]  Curt Nemo, InfoWars.com.
[01:00:56.778 --> 01:01:10.847]  In-house debate on the banker rescue, bill representative Brad Sherman, coming up later, told his fellow Congress members that the government will declare martial law and the stock market will drop 3,000 points if the bill is not passed.
[01:01:10.847 --> 01:01:13.489]  The panic mongers were to the point of telling people
[01:01:13.929 --> 01:01:19.718]  The market would drop 3,000 points and there would be martial law, said the Congressman.
[01:01:19.718 --> 01:01:22.823]  Physical martial law, not just in Congress, with the rules.
[01:01:26.690 --> 01:01:34.095]  Sherman's comment was not the same context as the comment issued by Representative Michael Burgess earlier in the week on this radio show.
[01:01:34.095 --> 01:01:49.827]  Burgess, who appeared on the Alex Jones Show, said Pelosi threatened to invoke House Rule 1368, described as martial law, intended to subpoena normal procedures, suspend normal procedures and safeguards, and thus allow the House of Leadership to operate in a more authoritarian fashion.
[01:01:49.827 --> 01:01:55.531]  Sherman, however, said martial law would be declared on Wall Street, not in the House of Representatives.
[01:01:56.211 --> 01:01:57.793]  Others are being told this as well.
[01:01:57.793 --> 01:01:58.974]  We have confirmed.
[01:01:58.974 --> 01:02:05.921]  Representative Sherman said that the exaggerated fear-mongering turned out not to be true and the House can draft a good bill.
[01:02:05.921 --> 01:02:15.571]  Regardless of the pressure put on representatives to pass the Banker Bailout Bill, the bailout plan is not only economic fascism, as Richard Vigery has correctly noted, designed to loot the U.S.
[01:02:15.571 --> 01:02:16.793]  Treasury and reorganize,
[01:02:17.728 --> 01:02:25.192]  And further consolidate elite control of the economy, but is also a brazen effort to impose a martial law and dictatorship.
[01:02:25.192 --> 01:02:33.416]  Paulson's role as financial dictator not answerable to Congress or the American people fully complements additional steps taken over the last few years.
[01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:38.438]  I would add that they've made the plan worse than it was last week and earlier this week.
[01:02:38.438 --> 01:02:40.159]  Even more criminal power.
[01:02:43.397 --> 01:03:11.029]  As former California congressman, joining us later in the show, Dan Hamburg, said earlier this year in 2007 in a detailed report in the San Francisco Chronicle, National Defense Authorization Act gives the executive the power to invoke martial law in case of public, major public emergencies, not limited to a natural disaster, a disease outbreak, or terrorist attack, but also any other condition in which the president determines the domestic violence has occurred to the extent that safe, that state officials cannot maintain public order.
[01:03:11.642 --> 01:03:24.694]  Obviously, a financial crash and ensured social chaos of the sort now being implemented by the ruling elite would be characterized as a dire emergency and a near-perfect excuse to impose martial law, a long-standing goal of the elite.
[01:03:24.694 --> 01:03:28.337]  We need to add all the IMF and World Bank document articles we did.
[01:03:28.337 --> 01:03:35.724]  We need to add the reports where we talk about how they detailed this and planned this and the Bilderberg plan this, how we told people years before it happened what they were planning to do.
[01:03:37.173 --> 01:03:45.601]  We need to add, uh, the documents that this is a contrived operation, that they've been gearing up for martial law quietly, so what you're going to see probably happened very soon.
[01:03:45.601 --> 01:03:47.923]  Again, didn't just pop up overnight.
[01:03:51.281 --> 01:04:11.173]  As well, the Military Commissions Act 2006 codifying indefinite imprisonment of dissidents and the National Security Presidential Directive 51 ensuring the continuity of government and separating Congress from that in the event of a catastrophic emergency are tools the government will most assuredly use after the economy implodes and now a foregone conclusion according to many economists.
[01:04:12.904 --> 01:04:17.206]  And remember, they are engineering all of this.
[01:04:17.206 --> 01:04:24.150]  We'll come back, finish up with the article, play some of the more key audio clips, and get to some of the incredible guests we have as we document all of this.
[01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:26.891]  This is so massive!
[01:04:26.891 --> 01:04:29.553]  And these stories are going megaviral, we've got to beef them up!
[01:04:31.519 --> 01:04:38.285]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:04:38.285 --> 01:04:40.927]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:04:40.927 --> 01:04:42.469]  But who is the enemy?
[01:04:42.469 --> 01:04:43.270]  Bin Laden.
[01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:44.150]  This is his MO.
[01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:45.652]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:04:45.652 --> 01:04:46.893]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:04:47.633 --> 01:04:54.779]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:04:54.779 --> 01:04:55.259]  Some U.S.
[01:04:55.259 --> 01:05:01.624]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:05:01.624 --> 01:05:05.067]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:05:05.307 --> 01:05:15.595]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:05:15.595 --> 01:05:16.815]  Fabled enemies.

[01:05:24.581 --> 01:05:27.984]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:05:31.263 --> 01:05:34.688]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[01:05:34.688 --> 01:05:37.011]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[01:05:37.011 --> 01:05:40.315]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[01:05:40.315 --> 01:05:47.204]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[01:05:47.204 --> 01:05:49.307]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[01:05:49.787 --> 01:05:53.089]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[01:05:53.089 --> 01:05:57.871]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[01:05:57.871 --> 01:06:01.814]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[01:06:01.814 --> 01:06:03.435]  Travel less, meet online.
[01:06:03.435 --> 01:06:06.116]  Go to Webex.com and try Webex free.

[01:06:17.262 --> 01:06:17.562]  Let's go.
[01:06:32.719 --> 01:06:35.921]  You know, I know exactly what you're thinking when it comes to this economy.
[01:06:35.921 --> 01:06:37.302]  The banks are crashing.
[01:06:37.302 --> 01:06:38.903]  The stock market's a mess.
[01:06:38.903 --> 01:06:40.564]  There's the mortgage crisis.
[01:06:40.564 --> 01:06:42.506]  There's the lending crisis.
[01:06:42.506 --> 01:06:47.169]  There is the food and gasoline prices through the ceiling crisis.
[01:06:47.169 --> 01:06:48.750]  And we are paralyzed a little bit.
[01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:50.731]  We don't know exactly how to respond to it.
[01:06:50.731 --> 01:06:51.512]  I don't know what to say.
[01:06:51.512 --> 01:06:52.312]  What can you do?
[01:06:52.312 --> 01:06:53.173]  Do what you can do.
[01:06:53.173 --> 01:06:53.793]  That's what you do.
[01:06:53.793 --> 01:06:54.914]  You do what you can do.
[01:06:54.914 --> 01:06:56.595]  What I can do is I can put some food away.
[01:06:56.715 --> 01:06:58.476]  I know there's a global food shortage.
[01:06:58.476 --> 01:06:59.036]  I can read it.
[01:06:59.036 --> 01:07:02.198]  I can go to efoodsdirect.com, read hundreds of articles about this.
[01:07:02.198 --> 01:07:06.580]  I can go up on the Google website and Google food shortage and see the world's a mess.
[01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:07.020]  I know it.
[01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:07.420]  You know it.
[01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:08.201]  Look at the prices.
[01:07:08.201 --> 01:07:08.901]  Look where they're headed.
[01:07:08.901 --> 01:07:09.521]  Be prepared.
[01:07:09.521 --> 01:07:10.202]  Take care of yourself.
[01:07:10.202 --> 01:07:16.305]  You owe your family some security, some sense of self-being, a little bit of self-reliance is a good idea right now.
[01:07:16.305 --> 01:07:18.446]  Get some food from efoodsdirect.com.
[01:07:18.446 --> 01:07:20.167]  Go up to efoodsdirect.com right now.
[01:07:20.167 --> 01:07:21.988]  Look, hey, you don't even have to can your own food anymore.
[01:07:21.988 --> 01:07:22.688]  We canned it for you.
[01:07:22.828 --> 01:07:24.429]  That's 1-800-409-5633, efoodsdirect.com, 1-800-409-5633, call us now.
[01:07:24.429 --> 01:07:27.850]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:01.724 --> 01:08:06.190]  I want to be clear to everyone tuning in.
[01:08:06.190 --> 01:08:17.686]  Congressman Burgess on Monday was told house rules will be suspended and that's unconstitutional and that basically the committee chairman would basically run everything.
[01:08:17.686 --> 01:08:18.387]  They didn't pass it.
[01:08:19.369 --> 01:08:25.414]  Others, congressmen on the record, have said that they've been threatened that martial law be declared if anybody tries to impeach Bush.
[01:08:25.414 --> 01:08:31.759]  When NORTHCOM has been deployed to the United States, it's set up as a theater of operations over the U.S.
[01:08:31.759 --> 01:08:42.648]  PDD 51 was signed last year, saying that President Bush, or any other president to come, is a dictator, Congress is not co-equal, and is now defunct.
[01:08:42.648 --> 01:08:45.631]  Just like the Emperor declared, you know, in Episode 3 of Star Wars.
[01:08:47.094 --> 01:08:49.575]  Again, this isn't a children's movie.
[01:08:49.575 --> 01:08:51.175]  This is the real world.
[01:08:51.175 --> 01:08:59.117]  Of course, on record, George Lucas said that he made that film and kind of changed the script to have it mirror what's happening today.
[01:08:59.117 --> 01:09:01.257]  He said that three years ago.
[01:09:01.257 --> 01:09:05.078]  I'm only pointing out in pop culture that seems to be a good analogy for people.
[01:09:05.078 --> 01:09:08.659]  This is very serious.
[01:09:08.659 --> 01:09:10.379]  Okay, folks.
[01:09:10.379 --> 01:09:14.180]  So, we are here at the crossroads.
[01:09:15.464 --> 01:09:28.789]  We're here at a major crossroads, and Burgess on Monday, who we had on, was talking about martial law just in the house.
[01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:33.731]  This is martial law in the country, and they've geared up for it.
[01:09:33.731 --> 01:09:35.192]  They've announced it, and
[01:09:35.911 --> 01:09:46.817]  The Congress has been told, and the Chairman of the Committee and others have been told of Homeland Security, that are supposedly co-equal with the President and National Security, that they can't see the details of PDD 51.
[01:09:46.817 --> 01:09:52.801]  But the cover sheet says, Congress has no authority and runs nothing during any emergency.
[01:09:52.801 --> 01:09:56.263]  Neither do the Governors.
[01:09:56.263 --> 01:09:59.044]  This hasn't been declared since Lincoln.
[01:09:59.044 --> 01:10:03.287]  And even then, Lincoln, you know, claimed that Congress had power, and was co-equal.
[01:10:04.341 --> 01:10:16.369]  Though he had several congressmen arrested and newspaper owners and editors, actually hundreds of those, but two members of Congress were arrested and basically put on house arrest for months.
[01:10:16.369 --> 01:10:20.832]  This isn't a game, okay?
[01:10:20.832 --> 01:10:31.939]  And only the public, being aware of this police state and saying no, and politically police chiefs, mayors, governors, 800 plus towns and cities,
[01:10:32.904 --> 01:10:36.325]  What, five states passed law saying no to the Patriot Act, no to martial law.
[01:10:36.325 --> 01:10:38.166]  Remember all that in the last four years?
[01:10:38.166 --> 01:10:40.066]  We went down to Austin.
[01:10:40.066 --> 01:10:44.167]  We got the fellow Austinites got it thrown out here.
[01:10:44.167 --> 01:10:45.688]  That footage is in Matrix of Evil.
[01:10:45.688 --> 01:10:49.869]  By the way, I'm going to find that clip from Matrix of Evil.
[01:10:49.869 --> 01:10:53.210]  I'm going to play that when we have time today.
[01:10:53.210 --> 01:10:57.971]  Where you can hear me talking about how they were preparing then.
[01:10:57.971 --> 01:10:59.652]  This is the reality.
[01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:06.022]  It's saying no, it's not going along with it.
[01:11:06.022 --> 01:11:13.445]  It's having grand jurors, grand juries indict some of these banker people for their crimes, as Ron Paul said last week.
[01:11:13.445 --> 01:11:16.387]  And it's, it's, it's, it's death the new world order by a thousand cuts.
[01:11:16.387 --> 01:11:18.348]  It's hitting them at all different angles at all different levels.
[01:11:18.348 --> 01:11:20.008]  There's no magic silver bullet.
[01:11:20.008 --> 01:11:25.531]  It's awareness, it's awakening, and the people are starting to awaken, but they have no idea just how deep the rabbit hole goes.
[01:11:25.531 --> 01:11:31.454]  So let me, let's play Congressman Burgess, Monday, talking about martial law in the House versus
[01:11:32.265 --> 01:11:36.813]  Congressman Brad Sherman talking about nationwide martial law.
[01:11:36.813 --> 01:11:38.216]  Here it is.
[01:11:38.216 --> 01:11:39.298]  Gentlemen, time has expired.
[01:11:39.298 --> 01:11:40.280]  The gentleman from Texas.
[01:11:41.129 --> 01:11:44.512]  Mr. Speaker, I ask permission to address the House for one minute, revise and extend my remarks.
[01:11:44.512 --> 01:11:45.232]  Without objection.
[01:11:45.232 --> 01:11:50.256]  Mr. Speaker, I also come to the floor today to talk about this $700 billion bill that's in front of us.
[01:11:50.256 --> 01:11:54.519]  I use the term bill advisedly because we have seen no bill.
[01:11:54.519 --> 01:12:02.926]  We are here debating talking points on perhaps what is one of the most largest, the largest fundamental change in our nation's financial system in its history.
[01:12:03.832 --> 01:12:06.094]  House Republicans have been cut out of the process.
[01:12:06.094 --> 01:12:13.699]  Not only have we been cut out of the process, we've also been derided by the leadership of the Democratic Party and called unpatriotic for not participating.
[01:12:13.699 --> 01:12:22.224]  Mr. Speaker, I have been thrown out of more meetings in this Capitol in the last 24 hours than I ever thought possible as a duly elected representative of 820,000 citizens of North Texas.
[01:12:25.490 --> 01:12:34.294]  Mr. Speaker, politics is a full contact sport and I understand that, but it is a full contact sport in the light of day, in the public arena.
[01:12:34.294 --> 01:12:41.777]  Since we didn't have hearings, since we didn't have markups, let's at least put this legislation up on the internet for 24 hours.
[01:12:41.777 --> 01:12:43.678]  That's what Thomas was made for.
[01:12:43.678 --> 01:12:47.680]  Let's do that and let the American people see what we have done in the dark of night.
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:54.003]  After all, I have not gotten any more mail, any more emails on any other subject than this one that is before us today.
[01:12:54.683 --> 01:12:59.084]  Mr. Speaker, I understand we're under martial laws declared by the Speaker last night.
[01:12:59.084 --> 01:13:00.504]  I think it's ironic.
[01:13:00.504 --> 01:13:07.906]  House Republicans have not been needed for a single thing in this House to assure passage for the last 22 months.
[01:13:07.906 --> 01:13:15.488]  And today, we're going to be asked to vote for a bill for political cover because Democrats are too weak to stand up to their Speaker.
[01:13:15.488 --> 01:13:16.028]  I yield back.
[01:13:16.028 --> 01:13:18.469]  Gentlemen, this time has expired.
[01:13:18.469 --> 01:13:22.010]  The gentleman from New Jersey.
[01:13:22.010 --> 01:13:23.170]  Now, that's Monday!
[01:13:24.008 --> 01:13:26.049]  This is last night.
[01:13:26.049 --> 01:13:27.850]  And the congressman's coming up later.
[01:13:27.850 --> 01:13:30.771]  They were threatened with martial law nationwide.
[01:13:30.771 --> 01:13:33.753]  Listen carefully.
[01:13:33.753 --> 01:13:40.116]  The only way they can pass this bill is by creating and sustaining a panic atmosphere.
[01:13:40.116 --> 01:13:43.418]  That atmosphere is not justified.
[01:13:43.418 --> 01:13:51.942]  Many of us were told in private conversations that if we voted against this bill on Monday that the sky would fall
[01:13:52.668 --> 01:14:04.451]  The market would drop two or three thousand points the first day, another couple thousand the second day, and a few members were even told that there would be martial law in America if we voted no.
[01:14:04.451 --> 01:14:06.911]  That's what I call fear-mongering.
[01:14:06.911 --> 01:14:08.251]  Unjustified.
[01:14:08.251 --> 01:14:09.632]  Proven wrong.
[01:14:09.632 --> 01:14:13.373]  We've got a week, we've got two weeks, to write a good bill.
[01:14:13.373 --> 01:14:18.094]  The only way to write, to pass a bad bill, keep the panic pressure on.
[01:14:18.094 --> 01:14:19.854]  Now what has the Senate done to this bill?
[01:14:22.842 --> 01:14:45.747]  And how we burned in the camps later thinking what would things have been like if every security operative when he went out at night to make an arrest had been uncertain whether he would return alive and have to say goodbye to his family or if during periods of mass arrest as for example in Leningrad when they arrested a quarter of the entire city people had not simply sat there in their
[01:14:46.844 --> 01:14:47.345]  We're good.
[01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:09.832]  We don't want it to come to that, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:09.832 --> 01:15:11.332]  We don't want it to come to that.
[01:15:32.839 --> 01:15:41.745]  But I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen, the very people that ran the communist operations, the Nazi operations, the same central banks based in London, it is historical fact.
[01:15:41.745 --> 01:15:49.790]  There are mainline, award-winning history books, over 900 pages, like Carol Quigley's and others, where the elite itself admits this.
[01:15:49.790 --> 01:15:53.053]  A recently published book by Zbigniew Brzezinski, he brags about the U.S.
[01:15:53.053 --> 01:15:57.676]  funding Pol Pot to kill two million.
[01:15:57.676 --> 01:16:02.379]  Our own criminal government, which isn't our government, put Mao Zedong into power, that's now declassified.
[01:16:04.457 --> 01:16:05.558]  This doesn't have to happen.
[01:16:05.558 --> 01:16:08.079]  I mean, it wasn't enough to ship in heroin and cocaine into the country.
[01:16:08.079 --> 01:16:09.440]  It wasn't enough to put everybody in prison.
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:10.700]  It wasn't enough to set up a police state.
[01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:12.121]  It wasn't enough to squeeze and squeeze.
[01:16:12.121 --> 01:16:13.922]  They want it all.
[01:16:13.922 --> 01:16:16.443]  They want to destroy America.
[01:16:16.443 --> 01:16:17.624]  And they've got us into debt.
[01:16:17.624 --> 01:16:20.505]  They got us to buy into the baloney of Wall Street and the media.
[01:16:20.505 --> 01:16:22.046]  And now they've got us where they think they want us.
[01:16:22.046 --> 01:16:24.727]  But the good news is the people are finally awakening.
[01:16:24.727 --> 01:16:32.832]  The sleeping giant is finally awakening to what's happening.
[01:16:32.832 --> 01:16:33.212]  And, Kurt,
[01:16:35.609 --> 01:17:00.241]  sent me earlier, it's congressman John Oliver, with John Oliver reporting on it, months ago, and there's another congressman as well, who was told, if you try to impeach George Bush, we will stage martial law on the United States headline, Iran attack, election suspension, martial law on the cards, this is from July 26, 2008, a few months ago,
[01:17:03.866 --> 01:17:07.050]  It didn't make the news, at least not the corporate news, according to Bob Fuhrer.
[01:17:07.050 --> 01:17:10.775]  Bush will attack Iran, declare martial law, and suspend the election.
[01:17:10.775 --> 01:17:18.826]  Congress critter John Oliver apparently made this claim at a town hall meeting at the Jones Library in Amherst, Massachusetts, and it was made in a bunch of newspapers.
[01:17:18.826 --> 01:17:20.588]  And the reporters are on record.
[01:17:20.588 --> 01:17:21.970]  Last July, Fuhrer, a lawyer,
[01:17:23.007 --> 01:17:33.331]  Political activists challenged Oliver in the first congressional district of Massachusetts was at the town hall meeting with others to present Oliver with resolutions to impeach Bush for war crimes.
[01:17:33.331 --> 01:17:41.714]  When Oliver made these comments on July 5th, 2007, the Atmer Downing Street website posted Fuhrer's retelling of the incident.
[01:17:41.714 --> 01:17:44.735]  And it goes into that, and then that was confirmed later, and it was in major newspapers.
[01:17:46.041 --> 01:17:48.743]  There's another congressman on record saying they've been told this.
[01:17:48.743 --> 01:18:05.712]  I mean, North Com, they come into the Army Times and announce, yeah, the Army's gonna be here for riot control, civil unrest, non-lethal weapons, we open up to shoot you with regular bullets, regular brigade, they're gonna rotate more brigades in for this.
[01:18:05.712 --> 01:18:15.318]  And you know, if we back this off, if we stop this, our attractors will say, oh see, you said martial law, it doesn't exist, ha ha ha, North American Union doesn't exist, you know, the WMDs were in Iraq, ha ha ha,
[01:18:17.074 --> 01:18:17.674]  It doesn't matter.
[01:18:17.674 --> 01:18:20.916]  That will be our victory.
[01:18:20.916 --> 01:18:27.979]  And stop... ...stopping it.
[01:18:27.979 --> 01:18:30.660]  I don't know if it can be done, but we should stop.
[01:18:30.660 --> 01:18:32.561]  ...if we can.
[01:18:32.561 --> 01:18:33.781]  And so, we have the facts.
[01:18:33.781 --> 01:18:34.762]  We have the Army Times.
[01:18:34.762 --> 01:18:36.082]  We have all the mainstream news.
[01:18:36.082 --> 01:18:37.323]  We have the Congressman on record.
[01:18:37.323 --> 01:18:38.003]  They're saying this.
[01:18:38.003 --> 01:18:38.844]  They're doing this.
[01:18:38.844 --> 01:18:39.544]  They're pushing this.
[01:18:42.972 --> 01:18:45.474]  We've got to stand firm against this, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:45.474 --> 01:18:56.701]  We've got to get the word out, and I need everybody to go to PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com and get these stories we've written on this subject and get it out to everybody.
[01:18:56.701 --> 01:18:57.982]  I'm not playing at this.
[01:18:57.982 --> 01:19:01.464]  We're not doing this to play patty-kick.
[01:19:01.464 --> 01:19:04.466]  We are fighting the New World Order as hard as we can, risking our lives.
[01:19:04.466 --> 01:19:06.367]  Can you imagine being on the front line of this?
[01:19:08.411 --> 01:19:12.495]  And not just the government, but all the crazies and the rest of it that come out of the woodwork.
[01:19:12.495 --> 01:19:19.181]  It is, it is so essential.
[01:19:19.181 --> 01:19:23.165]  It is so essential.
[01:19:23.165 --> 01:19:25.607]  To stand up against this system now.
[01:19:25.607 --> 01:19:28.730]  To speak out.
[01:19:28.730 --> 01:19:31.733]  And to stand up against this new world order.

[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:10.703]  They oppose everything that is God and Truth.
[01:21:10.703 --> 01:21:14.267]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[01:21:14.267 --> 01:21:26.779]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the Earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.

[01:21:39.215 --> 01:21:42.820]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:44.623]  But in liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:21:45.243 --> 01:21:48.284]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:21:48.284 --> 01:21:54.026]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:21:54.026 --> 01:21:58.288]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[01:22:37.208 --> 01:22:38.989]  Honey, have you seen the remote?
[01:22:38.989 --> 01:22:41.191]  Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?
[01:22:41.191 --> 01:22:42.972]  I can't find my wallet!
[01:22:42.972 --> 01:22:43.813]  Sound familiar?
[01:22:43.813 --> 01:22:47.275]  Why not save time looking for lost things and lose the stress instead?
[01:22:47.275 --> 01:22:52.618]  Introducing our patented Find One, Find All Key Finders, or FOFA XD for short.

[01:23:30.742 --> 01:23:54.176]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joins us to talk about the martial law gear-up we're seeing, and a little bit about the bailout.
[01:23:54.176 --> 01:23:56.377]  Then Congressman Dan Hamburger is going to be popping in.
[01:23:56.377 --> 01:23:59.840]  Congressman Brad Sherman, who was told martial law would be declared.
[01:24:01.653 --> 01:24:03.374]  Nationwide.
[01:24:03.374 --> 01:24:06.195]  If Congress didn't pass it.
[01:24:06.195 --> 01:24:08.897]  The executive saying, do this or we'll take your power.
[01:24:08.897 --> 01:24:10.777]  You can't do that, executive!
[01:24:10.777 --> 01:24:13.239]  You're not above the Congress, even if you claim you are.
[01:24:13.239 --> 01:24:17.581]  Even if you got a bunch of brainwashed North Com drug dealers at the top, that's what they are.
[01:24:17.581 --> 01:24:20.682]  That's how they first corrupted them decades ago.
[01:24:20.682 --> 01:24:23.463]  Who helped carry out your 9-11 attack.
[01:24:23.463 --> 01:24:25.664]  Your dictatorship is gonna be exposed.
[01:24:25.664 --> 01:24:28.686]  And it's a dictatorship of the corporate kleptocracy.
[01:24:28.686 --> 01:24:29.686]  The international bankers.
[01:24:29.686 --> 01:24:30.907]  Bush is just their figurehead.
[01:24:34.288 --> 01:24:36.109]  Oh man, so much is happening.
[01:24:36.109 --> 01:24:40.072]  I'm also going to be playing part of Matrix of Evil, where I warned about this in 2003.
[01:24:40.072 --> 01:24:48.877]  That's when Austin threw out the Patriot Act in hundreds of other cities in multiple states.
[01:24:48.877 --> 01:24:50.578]  You know, and listeners, you took action then.
[01:24:50.578 --> 01:24:53.460]  I put out the idea.
[01:24:53.460 --> 01:25:00.724]  When I wrote the first detailed analysis that won the Project Censored Award, I'm just giving you that as a footnote to find it.
[01:25:00.724 --> 01:25:02.706]  On Patriot Act 1 and 2.
[01:25:07.060 --> 01:25:09.601]  A detailed analysis, took me days to write it.
[01:25:09.601 --> 01:25:11.102]  It's like 12 pages long.
[01:25:11.102 --> 01:25:18.385]  I went through section by section and interviewed constitutional scholars to make sure mine was right, and of course it turned out I was.
[01:25:18.385 --> 01:25:22.786]  Just about how hardcore it really was.
[01:25:22.786 --> 01:25:29.049]  And then I put out the idea, because I can't do it all, for listeners all over the country, to have the idea.
[01:25:32.017 --> 01:25:40.341]  To start a, I forget the name of it, the Committee on Liberty, or to go out and start movements everywhere to throw it out, and it happened everywhere and happened.
[01:25:40.341 --> 01:25:41.542]  We can do the same thing here.
[01:25:41.542 --> 01:25:48.685]  So see now, city councils have heard us come and warn them about this, and now we don't sound like kooks because it's coming true.
[01:25:48.685 --> 01:25:57.989]  States agreed, what is it, four or five states last time I checked, last time I saw it was like eight considering it four or five and passed it, I think it's five now.
[01:25:57.989 --> 01:25:58.930]  Then it kind of fizzled out.
[01:25:59.716 --> 01:26:02.858]  Because the martial law, again, wasn't brought in then.
[01:26:02.858 --> 01:26:06.021]  So we have been warning the public, getting the information out.
[01:26:06.021 --> 01:26:11.464]  I'm gonna play the intro off my own cruddy laptop here, but later we're gonna play it in good audio.
[01:26:11.464 --> 01:26:16.888]  Like 15 minutes of Matrix of Evil after Dr. Roberts leaves us and all these congressmen are lined up to join us.
[01:26:16.888 --> 01:26:22.392]  Uh, but, um... Again, I'm gonna go ahead and take this back to the start.
[01:26:22.392 --> 01:26:22.592]  Here.
[01:26:22.592 --> 01:26:26.135]  By the way, you can now get this film on DVD.
[01:26:26.135 --> 01:26:27.616]  We finally took it off that and put it on, uh...
[01:26:28.444 --> 01:26:36.411]  From VHS, from the original digital tapes and DVDs available on Matrix of Evil.
[01:26:36.411 --> 01:26:44.679]  But I'm going to go ahead and start this now.
[01:26:44.679 --> 01:26:52.927]  Good old YouTube's not playing it.
[01:26:52.927 --> 01:26:54.288]  I just wanted people to hear the intro.
[01:26:55.373 --> 01:26:59.736]  So that they would be able to get an idea of what's coming up.
[01:26:59.736 --> 01:27:07.542]  Again, if you didn't just join us, or if you just did join us, I'm going to recap everything that's going on for everybody.
[01:27:07.542 --> 01:27:09.264]  Coming up with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:27:12.959 --> 01:27:22.964]  We're looking at the literal realization of a military police state in America.
[01:27:22.964 --> 01:27:29.068]  The American people have failed in their oversight of the integrity of our political system.
[01:27:29.068 --> 01:27:35.251]  The entire economy will be prisons, police in black ski masks, a Nazi Germany-like nightmare.
[01:27:35.251 --> 01:27:37.292]  The final target is the American people.
[01:27:38.075 --> 01:27:41.157]  We need to break that connection between the police and the military.
[01:27:41.157 --> 01:27:44.558]  We're charging for weapons of mass destruction because they have marijuana.
[01:27:44.558 --> 01:27:46.199]  I support the Constitution.
[01:27:46.199 --> 01:27:48.460]  We went to the odds with my own party.
[01:27:48.460 --> 01:27:50.001]  There really is an Illuminati.
[01:27:50.001 --> 01:27:51.982]  There really are 13 families.
[01:27:51.982 --> 01:27:53.983]  They own the big banks.
[01:27:53.983 --> 01:27:54.923]  Print the money.
[01:27:54.923 --> 01:27:57.805]  They're in our universities and they're in our conferences.
[01:27:57.805 --> 01:28:00.866]  And they believe in one world, not both.
[01:28:00.866 --> 01:28:07.070]  And plunge the American people into the deepest economic abyss of a generation.
[01:28:10.945 --> 01:28:12.086]  We're good to go.
[01:28:29.324 --> 01:28:34.367]  Topping our news, the approval of a resolution against the Patriot Act by the Austin City Council.
[01:28:34.367 --> 01:28:45.353]  The council approved the measure late last night by a vote of 4-3, and before making the decision, council members heard arguments both for and against the law, which gives the government more surveillance powers.
[01:28:45.353 --> 01:28:48.375]  Veronica Obergano is following the debate and brings us the latest details.
[01:28:50.211 --> 01:28:55.515]  It took more than four hours for the City Council members to adopt a resolution regarding the Patriot Act.
[01:28:55.515 --> 01:29:01.639]  That's because dozens of people signed up to talk on behalf of the Act, and at one point the meeting got a bit heated.
[01:29:01.639 --> 01:29:05.402]  I personally would like all our children
[01:29:06.222 --> 01:29:15.567]  To live in a country where they can have the say and the control over their lives and not some corrupt government official telling them what they can and cannot do.
[01:29:15.567 --> 01:29:17.988]  The USA Patriot Act is unnecessary.
[01:29:17.988 --> 01:29:20.430]  It is an insult to Americans.
[01:29:20.430 --> 01:29:28.013]  It is an insult to the heritage, to our heritage, and everyone who has worked together to create this country.
[01:29:28.013 --> 01:29:29.414]  We're on the march.
[01:29:29.414 --> 01:29:31.035]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:31.035 --> 01:29:34.637]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:37.898 --> 01:29:44.667]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:29:44.667 --> 01:29:47.311]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:29:47.311 --> 01:29:48.853]  But who is the enemy?
[01:29:48.853 --> 01:29:49.634]  Bin Laden.
[01:29:49.634 --> 01:29:50.535]  This is his MO.
[01:29:50.535 --> 01:29:52.017]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:29:52.017 --> 01:29:53.279]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:01.146]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:30:01.146 --> 01:30:01.627]  Some U.S.
[01:30:01.627 --> 01:30:07.993]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:30:07.993 --> 01:30:11.436]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:30:11.676 --> 01:30:21.961]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:30:21.961 --> 01:30:23.181]  Fabled enemies.
[01:30:23.181 --> 01:30:30.725]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:30:30.725 --> 01:30:34.327]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[01:30:37.625 --> 01:30:46.893]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[01:30:46.893 --> 01:30:55.080]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:57.722]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1%
[01:30:58.643 --> 01:30:59.283]  We're good to go!
[01:31:28.692 --> 01:31:29.233]  I think so.
[01:31:38.047 --> 01:31:40.048]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:31:40.048 --> 01:31:47.013]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:31:47.013 --> 01:31:55.398]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:31:55.398 --> 01:32:01.122]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:32:01.542 --> 01:32:03.144]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:32:03.144 --> 01:32:05.427]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:32:05.427 --> 01:32:09.872]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:32:09.872 --> 01:32:12.094]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[01:33:05.640 --> 01:33:07.762]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:07.762 --> 01:33:16.371]  Democratic congressmen, representatives, were threatened with martial law in America over bailout.
[01:33:16.371 --> 01:33:28.603]  This is not Congressman Burgess, who was on this show Monday, being threatened with what's known as martial law in the House, rarely declared, only a few times in its history where the
[01:33:30.063 --> 01:33:33.846]  Chairman and others restrict debate don't allow he was thrown out of meetings.
[01:33:33.846 --> 01:33:51.200]  This is physical martial law Northcom telling the army telling army times they're geared up for domestic operations all the history of this PDD 51 the John Warner Defense Authorization Act the Military Commissions Act
[01:33:51.892 --> 01:33:53.753]  This is actually happening.
[01:33:53.753 --> 01:33:55.113]  This is actually going on.
[01:33:55.113 --> 01:33:55.793]  They're being threatened.
[01:33:55.793 --> 01:33:57.754]  We already saw economic terrorism.
[01:33:57.754 --> 01:34:06.436]  Give the Treasury Secretary these incredible new powers, no oversight, and by the way, that's still in the new bill, or we'll have a depression.
[01:34:06.436 --> 01:34:08.237]  And then you see the market drop $1,200,000,000.3.
[01:34:08.237 --> 01:34:13.218]  That's economic terrorism.
[01:34:13.218 --> 01:34:16.639]  Never heard Treasury Secretaries or Presidents say, do this or there'll be a depression.
[01:34:16.639 --> 01:34:21.581]  And then they did, and then they had the Plunge Protection Team stand down Monday and let it fall to terrorize everybody.
[01:34:22.529 --> 01:34:34.773]  Dr. Roberts, who ran the Treasury, head of policy, number two position, former Wall Street Journal editor, best-selling author, syndicate of Collins, will join us in one minute, but I wanted to play for him, Brad Sherman, Marshall Law.
[01:34:34.773 --> 01:34:42.915]  Now, we talked to Ron Paul's office, he's trying to get on here, after the debate, right around the time Congressman Brad Sherman's coming on, he's confirmed.
[01:34:42.915 --> 01:34:47.957]  Former Congressman Dan Hamburger, who's warned about this in major publications, is coming on as well.
[01:34:47.957 --> 01:34:50.798]  But the point here is, that as soon as I talk to Paul,
[01:34:53.141 --> 01:34:53.942]  And Benton.
[01:34:53.942 --> 01:34:55.803]  They thought, you mean Burgess?
[01:34:55.803 --> 01:34:56.604]  And we said, no.
[01:34:56.604 --> 01:35:01.147]  Of course, we're not going to go to Paul and tell him this, but he's checking into it right now.
[01:35:01.147 --> 01:35:06.190]  And I've talked to other offices saying, yes, we've been told this, but we're not going to go on record with that.
[01:35:06.190 --> 01:35:13.956]  And then we played a clip earlier, and we covered an article earlier where a congressman a few months ago said we can't impeach Bush or he'll declare martial law, we've been told.
[01:35:13.956 --> 01:35:18.019]  Here is the clip from last night, representative Brad Sherman, martial law.
[01:35:18.019 --> 01:35:18.959]  Here it is.
[01:35:18.959 --> 01:35:19.720]  Eddie from Ohio.
[01:35:20.484 --> 01:35:26.847]  The only way they can pass this bill is by creating and sustaining a panic atmosphere.
[01:35:26.847 --> 01:35:30.148]  That atmosphere is not justified.
[01:35:30.148 --> 01:35:49.956]  Many of us were told in private conversations that if we voted against this bill on Monday, that the sky would fall, the market would drop two or three thousand points the first day, another couple thousand the second day, and a few members were even told that there would be martial law in America if we voted no.
[01:35:51.189 --> 01:35:53.651]  That's what I call fear-mongering.
[01:35:53.651 --> 01:35:54.991]  Unjustified.
[01:35:54.991 --> 01:35:56.372]  Proven wrong.
[01:35:56.372 --> 01:36:00.114]  We've got a week, we've got two weeks, to write a good bill.
[01:36:00.114 --> 01:36:04.837]  The only way to write, to pass a bad bill, keep the panic pressure on.
[01:36:04.837 --> 01:36:07.799]  Now what has the Senate done to this bill?
[01:36:07.799 --> 01:36:14.943]  Now notice that they activated NORTHCOM with brigades, not just one, if you read carefully more are coming, on October 1st.
[01:36:14.943 --> 01:36:16.324]  This is unbelievable.
[01:36:16.324 --> 01:36:18.125]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, what do you make of that?
[01:36:19.565 --> 01:36:23.086]  Well, if that was a congressman reporting, where?
[01:36:23.086 --> 01:36:24.607]  On the floor of the House?
[01:36:24.607 --> 01:36:25.767]  Yes, on C-SPAN, sir.
[01:36:25.767 --> 01:36:26.208]  C-SPAN.
[01:36:26.208 --> 01:36:27.568]  We have the video.
[01:36:27.568 --> 01:36:31.750]  Good.
[01:36:31.750 --> 01:36:38.412]  Obviously, they are using panic and threats to get something they want.
[01:36:38.412 --> 01:36:42.274]  There's no doubt about it, if that was an accurate report from a U.S.
[01:36:42.274 --> 01:36:46.075]  congressman.
[01:36:46.075 --> 01:36:47.536]  You know, what do you say of it?
[01:36:49.934 --> 01:37:03.837]  It's an enormous departure from the way government works in the United States, and I just can't believe they would do something like that.
[01:37:03.837 --> 01:37:10.679]  I mean, I know they're corrupt and evil and venal and war criminals and all the rest, but this does seem like it's pushing it.
[01:37:13.758 --> 01:37:14.698]  But we keep saying that.
[01:37:14.698 --> 01:37:19.520]  When we saw memos about torturing children from the White House, we didn't believe it and they admitted it.
[01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:24.821]  I mean, all the anthrax attacks clearly coming out of the White House, it's hard to believe.
[01:37:24.821 --> 01:37:29.522]  But it's all really happening.
[01:37:29.522 --> 01:37:33.343]  It looks that way, Alex.
[01:37:33.343 --> 01:37:37.624]  So they want this bailout probably for the power.
[01:37:38.661 --> 01:37:42.604]  More than to save the banks, but certainly for the two reasons it looks like.
[01:37:42.604 --> 01:38:00.979]  So they're after this sort of fascistic-type power over the financial sector, which gives them control over the whole thing, and they're bailing out their buddies that they got in trouble.
[01:38:00.979 --> 01:38:04.422]  It was Paulson who talked the Securities and Exchange Commission into
[01:38:06.217 --> 01:38:12.582]  Obliterating any capital requirements for their nebulous financial instruments.
[01:38:12.582 --> 01:38:26.693]  So, it looks pretty bad and I hope that the Congress will stand up to them, but I'm not very confident.
[01:38:26.693 --> 01:38:34.899]  Well, Congress has been taught if they say no to something or even balk at it, Anthrax suddenly hits all the enemies of the White House.
[01:38:36.521 --> 01:38:38.503]  Well, they have to just risk that, don't they?
[01:38:38.503 --> 01:38:47.610]  I mean, I think if that happened again, it just looks, you know, it kind of gives the show away.
[01:38:47.610 --> 01:38:57.817]  You know, plausible deniability evaporates with repeated instances of the same thing.
[01:38:57.817 --> 01:38:59.118]  But I don't know, Alex.
[01:38:59.118 --> 01:39:02.621]  I assume that they just
[01:39:04.970 --> 01:39:11.792]  Are using scare tactics to get the bill passed.
[01:39:11.792 --> 01:39:19.353]  It's not clear to me that the panic is that bad.
[01:39:19.353 --> 01:39:22.654]  So I'm not sure what they're after.
[01:39:22.654 --> 01:39:25.694]  Why are they doing it?
[01:39:25.694 --> 01:39:27.755]  Well it's certainly an escalation.
[01:39:29.364 --> 01:39:35.688]  They've shown they don't just threaten, they've shown that they're very reckless, very willful, and megalomaniacal as they are.
[01:39:35.688 --> 01:39:44.635]  Look, they've shown you, and me, and a few others, but I don't think the Congress thinks that the anthrax came from the government.
[01:39:44.635 --> 01:39:46.536]  I don't think they think that.
[01:39:46.536 --> 01:39:53.601]  I mean, I think they kind of believe, for the most part, most of them believe the official story, you know?
[01:39:53.601 --> 01:39:58.144]  The great, good, and decent Americans were attacked by the evil
[01:39:59.330 --> 01:40:02.311]  Uh, Muslim Islamists.
[01:40:02.311 --> 01:40:14.617]  And I think that's what... I think if they believed that they had been attacked by, you know, the Cheney-Neocon operation, they probably would have done something more about it.
[01:40:14.617 --> 01:40:18.619]  Notice how this lines up, and I want your particular perspective on this.
[01:40:18.619 --> 01:40:22.621]  I mean, you ran policy at Treasury, the number two guy there, the father of Reaganomics.
[01:40:24.119 --> 01:40:24.899]  Well, um...
[01:40:48.707 --> 01:41:07.306]  I don't know whether McCain means that the President should do it by eating, or whether he's, you know, the Federal Reserve has this sort of, what's this new facility they have, I forget what it's called, but the ability they have
[01:41:10.547 --> 01:41:17.750]  Um, which was previously, you know, limited to commercial banks who would want to discount the paper.
[01:41:17.750 --> 01:41:19.911]  They, oh yeah, the TAF, they call it.
[01:41:19.911 --> 01:41:30.055]  You know, the TAF, this lets the Fed already take a lot of these instruments.
[01:41:30.055 --> 01:41:32.696]  It's called a Term Auction Facility.
[01:41:32.696 --> 01:41:38.958]  And I think the Fed is already, in effect, doing these things that the bailout would do.
[01:41:40.106 --> 01:41:59.401]  So it may be under current laws or the ways they could interpret them or twist them that they could actually proceed without turning it into a bill.
[01:41:59.401 --> 01:42:08.668]  Now turning it into a bill gives them more things that they want that they wouldn't get just by going ahead
[01:42:09.842 --> 01:42:13.064]  Using things like the term auction facility.
[01:42:13.064 --> 01:42:18.208]  It gives them, if they get it, no review, no accountability.
[01:42:18.208 --> 01:42:34.078]  It lets them do other things that would benefit the accumulation of power in the executive branch and which would benefit
[01:42:34.753 --> 01:42:37.715]  Have you heard the clip of him saying that he aspires to be a dictator?
[01:43:00.044 --> 01:43:02.005]  Well, I think they all do.
[01:43:02.005 --> 01:43:07.449]  In fact, John, there at the network, I've gotten so used to all this tyranny.
[01:43:07.449 --> 01:43:09.330]  We got that two days ago.
[01:43:09.330 --> 01:43:15.333]  I am to tell you, do you have that McCain aspires to be a dictator clip?
[01:43:15.333 --> 01:43:17.375]  Well, just you two, but I want to play it.
[01:43:17.375 --> 01:43:18.775]  McCain aspires to be a dictator.
[01:43:18.775 --> 01:43:20.116]  Go ahead, Dr. Robertson.
[01:43:20.116 --> 01:43:26.200]  Yeah, I think that they all aspire to be one, and they say it, I think, in a joking way, even though they mean it.
[01:43:27.082 --> 01:43:36.492]  But, you know, there are a lot of other power centers that don't aspire for him to be a dictator.
[01:43:36.492 --> 01:43:42.659]  He doesn't have the Roman army like Caesar had.
[01:43:42.659 --> 01:43:47.324]  So, I'm sure that if they could work it by degree,
[01:43:50.515 --> 01:43:53.596]  A little bit here, a little bit there, a little bit there.
[01:43:53.596 --> 01:44:13.440]  The president will end up being a dictator and certainly we have discussed many times the many things that the Bush regime has done to elevate executive authority and to create a lot of movement in the direction of turning the executive branch into the ruling branch.
[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:14.721]  Totally ruling branch.
[01:44:14.721 --> 01:44:16.461]  And I'm sure they'll keep pushing
[01:44:17.538 --> 01:44:18.519]  I'm pushing that.
[01:44:18.519 --> 01:44:20.921]  Well, that's what PDD 51 does.
[01:44:20.921 --> 01:44:43.699]  It tells the Congress, you can't even see our plan, but the cover sheet says, the President, for any reason, including economic, and basically used Northcom, and the Army Times, which is an organ of the Pentagon, it was, quote, private, but it's an organ, every word is looked over, says, oh, we're going to use non-lethal weapons, and we hope we don't have to shoot you, but we're going to be on the streets of America for civil unrest.
[01:44:43.699 --> 01:44:46.501]  Right.
[01:44:46.501 --> 01:44:47.042]  That's right.
[01:44:50.496 --> 01:44:51.656]  Man, I tell you, this is crazy.
[01:44:51.656 --> 01:44:52.977]  This is only a one-minute clip.
[01:44:52.977 --> 01:44:59.959]  Here is John McCain in a press conference two days ago.
[01:44:59.959 --> 01:45:02.540]  I'm not saying this is the perfect answer.
[01:45:02.540 --> 01:45:12.743]  If I were a dictator, which I always aspire to be, I would write it a little bit differently.
[01:45:12.743 --> 01:45:14.304]  He doesn't laugh.
[01:45:14.304 --> 01:45:15.164]  No one else laughs.
[01:45:16.317 --> 01:45:22.602]  Yeah, that was with the newspaper, the Register, in what, Iowa or Idaho?
[01:45:22.602 --> 01:45:22.962]  Yeah.
[01:45:22.962 --> 01:45:25.384]  Iowa, maybe.
[01:45:25.384 --> 01:45:30.067]  Des Moines Register, I think it was.
[01:45:30.067 --> 01:45:40.735]  But I think that, I don't think McCain will become a dictator.
[01:45:40.735 --> 01:45:45.198]  If this crisis was as bad as they're telling the Congress,
[01:45:46.568 --> 01:46:03.635]  You would think that if Bush wanted to be a dictator, he'd just let the thing continue, and have the crisis materialize, and then use the PD-51 that he already has to take over.
[01:46:03.635 --> 01:46:13.779]  Well, Dr. Roberts, Dr. Roberts, what is it when the President and the Treasury Secretary run around and say, Depression, Depression, Destruction, Brown says it in Europe,
[01:46:14.904 --> 01:46:16.365]  I mean, I've never seen leaders do this.
[01:46:16.365 --> 01:46:20.428]  This would normally cause a depression or a massive stock market crash.
[01:46:20.428 --> 01:46:32.117]  So, it looks like they're actually trying to speed it along, and most market analysts that we've read and had on the air have been saying that this is financial terrorism to get what they want, and that it has driven down the market.
[01:46:32.117 --> 01:46:33.178]  So, there you go.
[01:46:33.178 --> 01:46:34.960]  Yeah, well, I think you're right.
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:44.387]  They're using terrorism to get what they want, just like they did with the invasion of Iraq and the invasion of
[01:46:45.206 --> 01:46:53.190]  Afghanistan and like they've tried to do to attack Iran and I'm sure they're doing that.
[01:46:53.190 --> 01:47:07.596]  I don't have any doubt but that they are creating panic and fear just like they did about weapons of mass destruction and I doubt that the panic and fear is justified.
[01:47:09.014 --> 01:47:11.738]  On the other hand, Paulson is not an economist.
[01:47:11.738 --> 01:47:13.780]  He's just a stock salesman.
[01:47:13.780 --> 01:47:17.205]  He's just some kind of a guy that puts deals together.
[01:47:17.205 --> 01:47:25.716]  And the notion that because he's Treasury Secretary that that means he knows anything about it is not true.
[01:47:27.020 --> 01:47:33.741]  The reason Treasury Secretaries have people like me and others is they don't know anything and they need somebody there to tell them.
[01:47:33.741 --> 01:47:35.722]  Well, there does seem to be an internal war.
[01:47:35.722 --> 01:47:43.723]  We've had a bunch of Fed Governors come out and say this is a horrible bailout, this is a police state, this is wrong, this is too much, I mean, it's bizarre.
[01:47:43.723 --> 01:47:55.505]  And then meanwhile you have Bernanke singing, you know, in step with the leaders of both parties, Republicans, Democrats, Bush, Paulson, saying give us everything we want or martial law.
[01:47:55.505 --> 01:47:56.045]  What is that?
[01:47:58.502 --> 01:48:03.844]  Well, I think Congress needs to call the bluff.
[01:48:03.844 --> 01:48:05.024]  That's what I think.
[01:48:05.024 --> 01:48:08.425]  And then let's see what happens.
[01:48:08.425 --> 01:48:09.806]  There's no point.
[01:48:09.806 --> 01:48:14.968]  If they give in, then they've got martial law.
[01:48:14.968 --> 01:48:16.928]  They get what they want anyhow.
[01:48:16.928 --> 01:48:21.350]  So they should just stand up to them and hold hearings.
[01:48:21.909 --> 01:48:25.890]  You know, this whole bailout, look, I can't speculate about this.
[01:48:25.890 --> 01:48:32.891]  I'm just disturbed about what you've said and what I've heard, as you are.
[01:48:32.891 --> 01:48:43.533]  I think that where I can speak with more confidence is that this bailout is working on the wrong end of the problem.
[01:48:43.533 --> 01:48:46.194]  It's not going to solve the problem.
[01:48:46.194 --> 01:48:48.614]  All the Paulson bailout does is it takes
[01:48:49.643 --> 01:48:55.487]  Uh, the troubled assets, the troubled assets off the banks books and puts it on the treasuries books.
[01:48:55.487 --> 01:48:55.948]  That's it.
[01:48:55.948 --> 01:49:04.133]  It secures the very institutions that engineered what is now coming to fruition and then hands the public the bill.
[01:49:04.133 --> 01:49:05.454]  That's the problem.
[01:49:05.454 --> 01:49:12.019]  The problem is the defaulting mortgages and the defaulting mortgages will continue.
[01:49:12.019 --> 01:49:15.101]  So just moving the assets from one book to another book
[01:49:15.811 --> 01:49:20.514]  Doesn't do anything about the problem, which is the foreclosures and the defaults.
[01:49:20.514 --> 01:49:26.997]  And that is rising, and you can expect it will rise faster as the economy sinks deeper into this recession.
[01:49:26.997 --> 01:49:29.178]  We're already in a recession.
[01:49:29.178 --> 01:49:31.880]  It's probably going to be a very bad one.
[01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:36.262]  And so, the Paulson bailout does nothing about the problem.
[01:49:36.262 --> 01:49:42.926]  It just moves it from one set of books to the others, and the problem will continue.
[01:49:42.926 --> 01:49:45.127]  And so, the way you would address this
[01:49:46.232 --> 01:49:50.176]  Is to go where the problem is, and that is the homeowners.
[01:49:50.176 --> 01:49:56.962]  Now what they did in the Great Depression, they created the Homeowners Loan Corporation.
[01:49:56.962 --> 01:50:01.906]  And the federal government went in and refinanced all the mortgages that were in trouble.
[01:50:01.906 --> 01:50:06.170]  I think it was something like a quarter of all the mortgages in the United States.
[01:50:06.170 --> 01:50:10.514]  They refinanced it and took the pressure off
[01:50:11.414 --> 01:50:12.255]  Stay there.
[01:50:12.255 --> 01:50:12.895]  Final segment.
[01:50:12.895 --> 01:50:13.636]  Dr. Paul Greg Roberts.
[01:50:13.636 --> 01:50:14.236]  More on the economy end.
[01:50:14.236 --> 01:50:19.820]  Not just the martial law end, but what he said about if they pass this bailout bill, they get economic martial law power.
[01:50:19.820 --> 01:50:20.641]  See, either way, it's happening.

[01:51:37.880 --> 01:51:43.621]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[01:51:43.621 --> 01:51:44.822]  And we knew what to do.
[01:51:44.822 --> 01:51:46.922]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:51:46.922 --> 01:51:53.284]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:51:53.965 --> 01:52:02.877]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:52:02.877 --> 01:52:09.666]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:52:09.946 --> 01:52:13.108]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:52:13.108 --> 01:52:17.030]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was BOOM!
[01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:17.330]  BOOM!
[01:52:17.330 --> 01:52:17.650]  BOOM!
[01:52:17.650 --> 01:52:17.970]  BOOM!

[01:52:37.182 --> 01:52:42.266]  Don't be a victim of sudden cardiac arrest due to inflammation of the arterial walls.

[01:53:41.151 --> 01:53:45.252]  Ladies and gentlemen, breaking news in the last 60 seconds.
[01:53:45.252 --> 01:53:50.894]  The house just passed the banker takeover bill.
[01:53:52.069 --> 01:54:01.238]  As of last night and this morning, it still had provisions, as the Washington Post said, sweeping the dictatorial powers for the Treasury to buy any assets, basically just do whatever they want.
[01:54:01.238 --> 01:54:02.539]  No oversight, no immunity.
[01:54:02.539 --> 01:54:06.042]  I mean, they actually have immunity.
[01:54:06.042 --> 01:54:10.907]  They just set up some puppet boards set up by the executive through Paulson.
[01:54:10.907 --> 01:54:13.489]  Just unbelievable.
[01:54:13.489 --> 01:54:16.512]  It has now passed, ladies and gentlemen, it says passed in whole.
[01:54:18.095 --> 01:54:19.076]  Well, it's a mistake.
[01:54:19.076 --> 01:54:24.378]  It is a mistake, and it'll probably lead to unanticipated problems, unintended consequences,
[01:54:46.634 --> 01:54:51.516]  And in fact, I see the market has just dropped in half.
[01:54:51.516 --> 01:54:55.717]  It was on a big rally and now it's dropped in half.
[01:54:55.717 --> 01:54:59.319]  Maybe that's in response to the passage.
[01:54:59.319 --> 01:55:03.080]  But the market, which was up 225 points, is now up 114.
[01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:05.281]  And prices have dropped across the board.
[01:55:15.691 --> 01:55:23.220]  If that's the market response to the bill, then already that tells you something.
[01:55:23.220 --> 01:55:26.143]  Look, Alex, governments make enormous mistakes.
[01:55:26.143 --> 01:55:29.608]  In fact, most of what they do is a mistake.
[01:55:32.737 --> 01:55:34.518]  That's how we got the Great Depression.
[01:55:34.518 --> 01:55:36.658]  It was a government mistake.
[01:55:36.658 --> 01:55:52.784]  They just so happen to have all this martial law stuff geared up and... They've got it... I don't know what they're... I don't know what they're up to, Alex, but you know, the thing that keeps coming back to me is that they don't have... The troops.
[01:55:52.784 --> 01:55:53.484]  The troops.
[01:55:53.484 --> 01:55:53.884]  Or the money.
[01:55:54.697 --> 01:55:56.138]  And they haven't got any money.
[01:55:56.138 --> 01:55:58.660]  This bailout, yeah, the market's going down.
[01:55:58.660 --> 01:56:03.462]  No, they just passed a trillion plus dollar defense budget six years ago.
[01:56:03.462 --> 01:56:05.203]  It was four hundred and something billion.
[01:56:05.203 --> 01:56:07.965]  I mean, I mean, it just it's out of control.
[01:56:07.965 --> 01:56:09.946]  Well, Alex, let's let's talk.
[01:56:09.946 --> 01:56:11.707]  Just talk about the details of it now.
[01:56:14.060 --> 01:56:20.965]  This bailout, which I think, didn't it increase from $700 billion to $850 billion?
[01:56:20.965 --> 01:56:25.008]  And then it's got absolutely open line, $851 billion.
[01:56:25.008 --> 01:56:31.732]  Okay, so that has to be, I think, near-term borrowing because this is a near-term crisis.
[01:56:31.732 --> 01:56:35.795]  This isn't something they're going to draw down over 10 or 20 years.
[01:56:35.795 --> 01:56:38.597]  So all of that, the Treasury doesn't have any money.
[01:56:38.597 --> 01:56:38.998]  It hasn't got $8.
[01:56:40.293 --> 01:56:41.574]  Much less, $800 billion.
[01:56:41.574 --> 01:56:43.034]  So all that has to be barred.
[01:56:43.034 --> 01:56:48.636]  It's got to be barred on top of a record budget deficit.
[01:56:48.636 --> 01:56:56.320]  And the record budget deficit itself is understated because it's based on the assumption of no recession.
[01:56:56.320 --> 01:56:57.960]  And we're in a recession.
[01:56:57.960 --> 01:57:03.202]  And the world is already starting to balk at buying more debt.
[01:57:03.202 --> 01:57:09.345]  Alex, so now, if you're the foreign creditors and you're used to, say, lending us
[01:57:10.365 --> 01:57:21.894]  $200 billion every year to finance the budget deficit, and then the budget deficit goes to $450 billion at a minimum, maybe more likely $600 billion.
[01:57:21.894 --> 01:57:23.836]  So it's tripled.
[01:57:23.836 --> 01:57:27.358]  And then you add on top of that another $800 billion.
[01:57:27.358 --> 01:57:34.164]  So, you know, it's more than Quinn tripled the credit demands that we're giving to our foreign bankers.
[01:57:34.164 --> 01:57:36.746]  Now, are they going to blink?
[01:57:36.746 --> 01:57:37.867]  Are they going to say, well,
[01:57:38.757 --> 01:57:46.779]  What's going to happen to the Treasury's own credit rating when it has to take so much debt to market?
[01:57:46.779 --> 01:57:47.740]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:57:47.740 --> 01:57:50.380]  I don't think they've thought about any of this.
[01:57:50.380 --> 01:57:52.821]  And the reason they don't think about it is they're fully hubris.
[01:57:52.821 --> 01:57:56.062]  They think, you know, that we're the superpower.
[01:57:56.062 --> 01:58:01.604]  They have all these imaginary existences for themselves.
[01:58:01.604 --> 01:58:02.624]  So we don't know what
[01:58:03.445 --> 01:58:07.167]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:07.167 --> 01:58:08.548]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:28.044 --> 01:58:34.810]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:58:34.810 --> 01:58:37.453]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:58:37.453 --> 01:58:38.994]  But who is the enemy?
[01:58:38.994 --> 01:58:39.795]  Bin Laden.
[01:58:39.795 --> 01:58:40.656]  This is his ammo.
[01:58:40.656 --> 01:58:42.177]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:58:42.177 --> 01:58:43.759]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:58:44.139 --> 01:58:51.302]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:58:51.302 --> 01:58:51.762]  Some U.S.
[01:58:51.762 --> 01:58:58.125]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:58:58.125 --> 01:59:01.566]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:59:01.826 --> 01:59:12.090]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:59:12.090 --> 01:59:13.330]  Fabled enemies.
[01:59:13.330 --> 01:59:21.073]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:59:21.073 --> 01:59:24.454]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:59:30.491 --> 01:59:32.900]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:32.900 --> 01:59:35.670]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:59:42.165 --> 01:59:46.987]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:59:46.987 --> 01:59:48.568]  You want answers?
[01:59:48.568 --> 01:59:50.129]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:50.129 --> 01:59:54.330]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:54.330 --> 01:59:58.632]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:59:58.632 --> 02:00:02.034]  Alright, we're 90% we're on call on the next two hours.
[02:00:02.034 --> 02:00:06.376]  100% Congressman Dan Hamburg, 100% Congressman Brad Sherman.
[02:00:07.436 --> 02:00:08.657]  Our station's just joining us.
[02:00:08.657 --> 02:00:14.779]  They told them martial law will be declared in the United States physically if House members don't pass this.
[02:00:14.779 --> 02:00:16.599]  Well, they just did.
[02:00:16.599 --> 02:00:18.000]  T-minus eight minutes ago.
[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:19.320]  The vote was eight minutes ago.
[02:00:19.320 --> 02:00:20.801]  They passed it eight minutes ago.
[02:00:20.801 --> 02:00:23.662]  We got four minutes left with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[02:00:23.662 --> 02:00:27.103]  During the one-minute break we were talking about this is leading to complete disaster.
[02:00:27.103 --> 02:00:30.984]  The troops won't be able to carry out martial law because their poor families are going to be starving.
[02:00:30.984 --> 02:00:32.805]  Same thing with cops.
[02:00:32.805 --> 02:00:35.366]  Finish up, sir, with now where you see this going.
[02:00:37.675 --> 02:00:49.041]  Well, I think one of the biggest tests is going to be the response of foreign creditors to the Treasury's assumption of enormous new debt responsibilities.
[02:00:50.120 --> 02:00:52.161]  You know, the world's already flooded with dollars.
[02:00:52.161 --> 02:01:03.245]  You know, the dollar's been losing value in relation to other currencies, in relation to precious metals, in relation to oil, because there's already too much United States government debt.
[02:01:03.245 --> 02:01:04.205]  Too many dollars.
[02:01:04.205 --> 02:01:07.966]  Too big of a trade deficit.
[02:01:07.966 --> 02:01:11.628]  Now the budget deficit is huge, and recession is hitting it.
[02:01:11.628 --> 02:01:12.388]  It will grow.
[02:01:12.388 --> 02:01:18.330]  Now they're going to come up and need to borrow another $800 billion from foreign creditors.
[02:01:19.033 --> 02:01:22.820]  So the test is, will they lend?
[02:01:22.820 --> 02:01:28.150]  Or will they lend at the low interest rates that the bailout really needs in order to be successful?
[02:01:29.772 --> 02:01:32.993]  This is going to be a big test.
[02:01:32.993 --> 02:01:34.774]  I don't think they've thought about that.
[02:01:34.774 --> 02:01:36.875]  What about all the credit card debt coming due, too?
[02:01:36.875 --> 02:01:38.797]  I mean, the real economy is screwed.
[02:01:38.797 --> 02:01:40.638]  Well, that's right.
[02:01:40.638 --> 02:01:47.121]  What is really coming out of this financial crisis is concentration.
[02:01:47.121 --> 02:01:48.922]  We see financial concentration.
[02:01:48.922 --> 02:01:51.003]  We're going to end up with three banks.
[02:01:51.003 --> 02:01:51.824]  Bank of America,
[02:01:52.464 --> 02:01:58.309]  You know, Wells Fargo, Wachovia, and Citicorp.
[02:01:58.309 --> 02:01:59.570]  And we're four banks.
[02:01:59.570 --> 02:02:02.812]  And Chase, and JPMorgan Chase.
[02:02:02.812 --> 02:02:05.694]  So we'll have four giant banks.
[02:02:05.694 --> 02:02:08.476]  It'll be monopoly capitalism.
[02:02:08.476 --> 02:02:11.779]  And it's so funny because it's come out of deregulation.
[02:02:11.779 --> 02:02:15.802]  It's come out of a market ideology.
[02:02:15.802 --> 02:02:21.046]  And so we see that the result of Phil Graham and Newt Gingrich and
[02:02:21.818 --> 02:02:24.118]  And all of that is monopoly capitalism.
[02:02:24.118 --> 02:02:25.819]  The method to the madness, though.
[02:02:25.819 --> 02:02:26.959]  They don't... They want to rule.
[02:02:26.959 --> 02:02:27.859]  It's like Satan.
[02:02:27.859 --> 02:02:29.679]  I'd rather rule in hell than serve in heaven.
[02:02:29.679 --> 02:02:31.740]  And they think they're in control of it.
[02:02:31.740 --> 02:02:36.181]  They want to rule a dung heap instead of the paradise this country was.
[02:02:36.181 --> 02:02:38.201]  Well, maybe that's it.
[02:02:38.201 --> 02:02:50.243]  I don't... You know, the Russian president the other day said, quite truthfully in my opinion, that the era of American dominance is over.
[02:02:51.996 --> 02:03:04.466]  And I think that's true, and I think that we also had the German Foreign Minister also say the same thing, that the dollar would be dethroned as reserve currency.
[02:03:04.466 --> 02:03:10.731]  So what they're going to do is they're going to end up with lots of debts that they're not going to be able to pay in
[02:03:12.501 --> 02:03:12.601]  Yes.
[02:03:35.208 --> 02:03:40.812]  So I don't know what the outcome is, but this bill is not going to be the end of the problem.
[02:03:40.812 --> 02:03:50.479]  It may simply cause worse problems, and as I said earlier in our interview today, it does not address the default rate.
[02:03:50.479 --> 02:03:56.044]  I mean, people are defaulting on the mortgages, and that's the problem, and the bill does nothing.
[02:03:56.917 --> 02:03:58.078]  To stop that.
[02:03:58.078 --> 02:04:00.499]  So that is going to continue with all of its implications.
[02:04:00.499 --> 02:04:01.620]  It only protects the bankers.
[02:04:01.620 --> 02:04:03.761]  It only protects them and it'll destroy them in the end.
[02:04:03.761 --> 02:04:05.622]  In closing, I appreciate you joining us, sir.
[02:04:05.622 --> 02:04:07.123]  We'll talk to you in the near future.
[02:04:07.123 --> 02:04:12.026]  His new book is out, The Journey of Good Intentions, now in an updated version.
[02:04:12.026 --> 02:04:16.148]  But meanwhile, a lot of the yuppies I talk to laugh and giggle and think it's all funny.
[02:04:16.148 --> 02:04:18.910]  They have no idea what's happened as well.
[02:04:18.910 --> 02:04:21.991]  There's a lot of humor that's not just by the elite, but by the general public.
[02:04:21.991 --> 02:04:24.213]  Dr. Roberts, thank you for coming on with us.
[02:04:24.213 --> 02:04:26.154]  Yes, Alex, you keep on doing your good work.
[02:04:26.614 --> 02:04:27.074]  I'll try.
[02:04:27.074 --> 02:04:27.975]  God bless you.
[02:04:27.975 --> 02:04:28.515]  God bless you.
[02:04:28.515 --> 02:04:29.335]  Take care.
[02:04:29.335 --> 02:04:30.356]  Read his columns everywhere.
[02:04:30.356 --> 02:04:31.936]  Just Google Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[02:04:31.936 --> 02:04:32.657]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:32.657 --> 02:04:33.497]  I've got big guys coming up.
[02:04:33.497 --> 02:04:33.897]  Stay with me.
[02:04:42.048 --> 02:04:43.929]  The stock market is crazy.
[02:04:43.929 --> 02:04:46.871]  The chemtrails are spraying us with their chemicals.
[02:04:46.871 --> 02:04:49.213]  It's time to think about what is important.
[02:04:49.213 --> 02:04:52.115]  Most forget just how important life is.
[02:04:52.115 --> 02:04:59.039]  Life Change Tea removes toxins, chemicals, parasites, and bacteria that store up in your body.
[02:04:59.039 --> 02:04:59.740]  It cleanses you.
[02:05:00.120 --> 02:05:02.342]  And gives you results in hours.

[02:05:17.353 --> 02:05:17.373]  3080408.
[02:05:17.373 --> 02:05:18.614]  I'll say it again.
[02:05:18.614 --> 02:05:18.874]  9283080408.

[02:05:26.598 --> 02:05:27.638]  It is a big idea.
[02:05:27.638 --> 02:05:28.318]  A new world order.
[02:05:28.318 --> 02:05:30.980]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful
[02:05:47.190 --> 02:05:50.012]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:05:50.012 --> 02:05:52.795]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:05:52.795 --> 02:05:55.977]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:05:55.977 --> 02:06:06.326]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:06:06.326 --> 02:06:11.290]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:06:11.770 --> 02:06:15.633]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:06:15.633 --> 02:06:19.357]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world which our people... Most people have no idea.
[02:06:19.357 --> 02:06:20.157]  They're not after money.
[02:06:20.157 --> 02:06:21.438]  They have all the money they need.
[02:06:21.438 --> 02:06:22.399]  They're after power.
[02:06:22.399 --> 02:06:23.560]  That's what they're after.

[02:06:35.090 --> 02:06:36.191]  You have been warned.
[02:06:36.883 --> 02:06:40.326]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[02:06:40.326 --> 02:06:42.628]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[02:06:42.628 --> 02:06:45.931]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[02:06:45.931 --> 02:06:52.817]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[02:06:52.817 --> 02:06:54.939]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[02:06:55.439 --> 02:06:58.720]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[02:06:58.720 --> 02:07:03.501]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[02:07:03.501 --> 02:07:07.442]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[02:07:07.442 --> 02:07:09.062]  Travel less, meet online.
[02:07:09.062 --> 02:07:11.743]  Go to Webex.com and try Webex free.

[02:07:18.985 --> 02:07:19.305]  I think so.
[02:07:42.660 --> 02:07:43.981]  Big Brother.
[02:07:43.981 --> 02:07:45.741]  Mainstream media.
[02:07:45.741 --> 02:07:47.502]  Government cover-ups.
[02:07:47.502 --> 02:07:49.082]  You want answers?
[02:07:49.082 --> 02:07:50.643]  Well, so does he.
[02:07:50.643 --> 02:07:54.824]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:07:54.824 --> 02:07:58.906]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:03.952 --> 02:08:10.838]  Wrote a story for the San Francisco Chronicle that detailed the plans for martial law takeover during an economic controlled implosion.
[02:08:10.838 --> 02:08:15.902]  He will join us in T-minus 22 minutes.
[02:08:15.902 --> 02:08:18.024]  Ron Paul, we're very close to getting him on.
[02:08:18.024 --> 02:08:23.708]  He's just having to deal with the vote and now with a ton of media fighting his way in here.
[02:08:23.708 --> 02:08:25.910]  In fact, Trey, call him again.
[02:08:25.910 --> 02:08:29.453]  Stuff happened like me on the phone with Ron Paul and the cord comes out of the phone.
[02:08:29.453 --> 02:08:30.974]  And this office, everything falls apart.
[02:08:30.974 --> 02:08:32.215]  It's like a land crawler in here.
[02:08:33.415 --> 02:08:34.536]  We've got that going on.
[02:08:34.536 --> 02:08:37.918]  Congressman Brad Sherman is coming up.
[02:08:37.918 --> 02:08:42.680]  250 Enish is what it says.
[02:08:42.680 --> 02:08:44.401]  I know that was all so crazy.
[02:08:44.401 --> 02:08:45.302]  The vote is over, though.
[02:08:45.302 --> 02:08:46.602]  It came earlier than they thought.
[02:08:46.602 --> 02:08:52.886]  So, Trey, go ahead and call them and adjust if Congressman Brad Sherman wants to come on earlier.
[02:08:52.886 --> 02:08:57.108]  He's already agreed, but I don't want to wait an hour and five minutes.
[02:08:57.108 --> 02:09:00.610]  I bet because the vote's over he can come in now.
[02:09:00.610 --> 02:09:01.590]  We'll see what happens.
[02:09:01.590 --> 02:09:02.291]  Just stay with us.
[02:09:04.191 --> 02:09:12.717]  For those that just joined us, the Democratic Congressional Representatives were threatened with martial law, nationwide martial law, not just in Congress.
[02:09:12.717 --> 02:09:15.940]  Give American bailout.
[02:09:15.940 --> 02:09:20.002]  Again, Democratic Congressional Representatives were threatened with martial law in America over bailout.
[02:09:20.002 --> 02:09:23.045]  That's the Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com headline.
[02:09:23.045 --> 02:09:27.988]  Actually, that story is from PrisonPlanet.com separately by Steve Watson.
[02:09:27.988 --> 02:09:29.409]  It covers some of the facets.
[02:09:29.409 --> 02:09:33.472]  And then on Infowars.com, there is another story
[02:09:34.521 --> 02:09:37.404]  Uh, that is up there.
[02:09:37.404 --> 02:09:43.051]  That comes from Kurt Nemo, the first one out on this this morning.
[02:09:43.051 --> 02:09:48.617]  There's the video of this being said, Marshall Law will be declared a bank or bailout not passed in-house.
[02:09:48.617 --> 02:09:52.121]  Now we need to say, headline, Congress threatened with Marshall Law.
[02:09:53.726 --> 02:09:57.748]  He's terrorized into passing bill.
[02:09:57.748 --> 02:10:01.230]  Congress house terrorized with threat of martial law.
[02:10:01.230 --> 02:10:02.370]  That needs to be the headline.
[02:10:02.370 --> 02:10:06.452]  I don't care if Steve Watson, Paul Watson, Kurt Nemo, Aaron Dykes are limited riders.
[02:10:06.452 --> 02:10:08.633]  We need it up there now.
[02:10:08.633 --> 02:10:11.234]  That is the bottom line now.
[02:10:11.234 --> 02:10:15.236]  And then just basically take the info and the other two stories and rehash it there, but add the new information.
[02:10:15.891 --> 02:10:26.219]  And you heard the former head of policy, Department of Treasury, just say this bill effectively creates economic martial law through the Treasury with the private banks.
[02:10:26.219 --> 02:10:28.962]  So we just got martial law!
[02:10:28.962 --> 02:10:32.965]  And the magnitude of it isn't even properly affecting me!
[02:10:32.965 --> 02:10:40.571]  We live so close to this problem here that it's actually happening and now we don't even see it for what it is.
[02:10:40.571 --> 02:10:41.492]  Let me explain that again.
[02:10:44.190 --> 02:10:57.235]  House of Representatives terrorized by threat of martial law passes Banker Empowerment Bill that sets up financial dictatorship in the United States.
[02:10:57.235 --> 02:10:59.135]  That is the main headline and sub-headline.
[02:10:59.135 --> 02:11:00.816]  That is what it is.
[02:11:00.816 --> 02:11:04.577]  So we're going to give you martial law unless you give us martial law powers.
[02:11:04.577 --> 02:11:05.837]  Because they didn't want that confrontation.
[02:11:05.837 --> 02:11:07.558]  They didn't want to have to have it come out in the open.
[02:11:07.558 --> 02:11:09.999]  So they said we got North Com standing right by.
[02:11:11.147 --> 02:11:13.289]  We got the anthrax packages right now.
[02:11:13.289 --> 02:11:16.291]  We'll tell them the guys with the beers and the turbines did it.
[02:11:16.291 --> 02:11:22.316]  You pass this right now, we activate NORTHCOM, the brigade standing by at Colorado Springs.
[02:11:22.316 --> 02:11:26.700]  We'll bring them into Washington.
[02:11:26.700 --> 02:11:28.461]  Unbelievable!
[02:11:28.461 --> 02:11:33.725]  And now, you heard Dr. Roberts, all this does is protect the banks, and it will implode the real economy.
[02:11:33.725 --> 02:11:36.908]  Now they're gonna kill the economy, and the market knows that, that's why it's plunging right now.
[02:11:38.204 --> 02:11:40.106]  They terrorize Congress into this.
[02:11:40.106 --> 02:11:45.291]  This is horrible!
[02:11:45.291 --> 02:11:46.652]  Let's go to Steve Schenke.
[02:11:46.652 --> 02:11:49.375]  He was set up for the show and boy what a crazy day to have him on.
[02:11:49.375 --> 02:11:51.017]  He was set up days ago.
[02:11:51.787 --> 02:11:57.715]  I appreciate him letting him move him to a little bit later because I was too busy early on to even have him on today, though it's vital.
[02:11:57.715 --> 02:12:02.021]  And Steve, I got so busy I didn't put in the order a couple weeks ago when you were last on.
[02:12:02.021 --> 02:12:05.466]  I want a year's supply for three people, another one.
[02:12:05.466 --> 02:12:06.688]  I hope I can get it in time.
[02:12:06.688 --> 02:12:08.150]  How fast can you ship it to me?
[02:12:09.303 --> 02:12:10.304]  Just bill me?
[02:12:10.304 --> 02:12:11.405]  Just get it to me?
[02:12:11.405 --> 02:12:14.287]  It's already being billed, Alex.
[02:12:14.287 --> 02:12:22.933]  I assumed that that's what we needed after our last conversation, but Alex, I got to... I got to... I got to talk.
[02:12:22.933 --> 02:12:24.955]  Okay.
[02:12:24.955 --> 02:12:29.117]  One of the... Benny, these jackasses...
[02:12:30.789 --> 02:12:47.397]  With 90% of the people calling these people telling them no, and they go ahead and do it anyway, this is the most phenomenal act of treason that's ever been perpetrated in this country, and I don't know why we can't just impeach the whole stinkin' Congress of the United States in a whole mess.
[02:12:47.397 --> 02:12:49.517]  But the mechanism is controlled, isn't it?
[02:12:49.517 --> 02:12:50.398]  It's protected.
[02:12:50.398 --> 02:12:53.499]  They protect themselves, and I'll guarantee this bill protects them.
[02:12:53.499 --> 02:12:57.161]  If you'd have heard, Glenn Beck did a marvelous job last night
[02:12:58.044 --> 02:13:00.126]  I'm going through some of the issues.
[02:13:00.126 --> 02:13:05.412]  They are setting aside millions of dollars for research on wooden arrows for toys.
[02:13:05.412 --> 02:13:08.856]  But let me tell you, that is the important, but it's the diversion.
[02:13:08.856 --> 02:13:09.517]  Absolutely.
[02:13:09.517 --> 02:13:14.102]  The media is covering the pork barrel and the wooden arrows and carbon taxes.
[02:13:14.102 --> 02:13:18.287]  The real issue is it gives immunity and dictatorial power to the Treasury.
[02:13:18.867 --> 02:13:19.948]  Absolutely.
[02:13:19.948 --> 02:13:21.890]  And immunity to all of these characters.
[02:13:21.890 --> 02:13:23.791]  I'll guarantee you that's built in there.
[02:13:23.791 --> 02:13:25.432]  But let's... No, no, we have the subsection.
[02:13:25.432 --> 02:13:26.773]  You're absolutely right.
[02:13:26.773 --> 02:13:29.515]  Let's talk about what we're dealing with.
[02:13:29.515 --> 02:13:41.865]  You and I have been telling these folks that with the economy going as it was, with the shortages of food, the starvation worldwide and everything, that they had to take... And by the way, food riots exploded worldwide this week.
[02:13:41.865 --> 02:13:42.745]  It's intensifying.
[02:13:42.745 --> 02:13:43.926]  You were right.
[02:13:43.926 --> 02:13:44.507]  I was wrong.
[02:13:45.047 --> 02:13:48.030]  I keep thinking it's not as bad as people are saying.
[02:13:48.030 --> 02:13:50.873]  Well, let me tell you how bad this thing is.
[02:13:50.873 --> 02:13:52.535]  They're talking martial law.
[02:13:52.535 --> 02:13:54.357]  The Second Patriot Act.
[02:13:54.357 --> 02:14:04.046]  If they have any reason or excuse to have a national emergency and martial law is it, they have the power and they will take over distribution of food.
[02:14:04.046 --> 02:14:08.531]  Now our warehouse is buying like crazy trying to get every morsel of food they can get in there.
[02:14:09.171 --> 02:14:16.780]  But it's not going to do one stinking bit of good if they pull a plug on this thing and get runaway inflation going on.
[02:14:16.780 --> 02:14:19.063]  What happens with runaway inflation, Alex?
[02:14:19.063 --> 02:14:20.725]  Prices explode!
[02:14:20.725 --> 02:14:25.511]  They absolutely explode, and unless people have the stuff that they need already bought,
[02:14:26.331 --> 02:14:30.253]  Even if it's on a stinkin' credit card, that will fix the cost.
[02:14:30.253 --> 02:14:47.843]  And they can pay for it with cheap money, but the fact is that if our families out there get caught with either martial law or the runaway inflation when they start filtering this $700 billion down through the monetary system, they will not buy food.
[02:14:47.843 --> 02:14:51.245]  Let me tell listeners what it looks like.
[02:14:51.245 --> 02:14:52.786]  Every time there's a hurricane in Texas,
[02:14:53.533 --> 02:14:58.978]  The 3 million illegal aliens, that's how many are in South Texas, flood all little towns, neighborhoods.
[02:14:58.978 --> 02:14:59.779]  It's a fact.
[02:14:59.779 --> 02:15:01.120]  Robbing, stealing.
[02:15:01.120 --> 02:15:03.963]  I was at a grocery store in Buffalo, Texas during the hurricane.
[02:15:03.963 --> 02:15:06.725]  There were thousands of illegal aliens roving around.
[02:15:06.725 --> 02:15:11.710]  People coming into the gun shop I was at, buying more ammo across the street in Buffalo.
[02:15:11.710 --> 02:15:13.932]  Buffalo Sporting Goods is the name of it.
[02:15:13.932 --> 02:15:15.073]  You can ask folks in Buffalo.
[02:15:15.373 --> 02:15:18.337]  It was on I-45 between Dallas and Houston.
[02:15:18.337 --> 02:15:20.519]  They come in and say, my wallet got stolen out of my car.
[02:15:20.519 --> 02:15:21.741]  My car got robbed.
[02:15:21.741 --> 02:15:23.463]  Folks, it's gonna look much worse than that.
[02:15:24.409 --> 02:15:36.701]  Well, I tell you what, as a result of the runaway inflation that this absolutely ensures, as a result of the martial law that absolutely ensures, there are two things that people better daggum well do.
[02:15:36.701 --> 02:15:44.269]  They better get their 12-gauge set up behind the door with plenty of ammunition, and they better get about three or four years' worth of food, and they better do it now.
[02:15:44.269 --> 02:15:47.172]  We're at capacity, but we're doubling up.
[02:15:47.712 --> 02:15:51.893]  I'm telling you, this thing is the death knell to the country.
[02:15:51.893 --> 02:15:52.933]  Absolutely.
[02:15:52.933 --> 02:15:57.894]  And the only way families are going to survive is if these people take control and get their own food.
[02:15:57.894 --> 02:16:01.215]  You cannot trust these people to your survival.
[02:16:01.215 --> 02:16:01.875]  They're absolute criminals.
[02:16:01.875 --> 02:16:07.036]  And I don't care whether you get it from J. Michael Stevens' group and E-Food's director or not, you go get food.
[02:16:07.036 --> 02:16:09.096]  Don't buy the canned junk out of the grocery store.
[02:16:09.096 --> 02:16:10.677]  You gotta get storable stuff.
[02:16:10.677 --> 02:16:12.417]  But get food wherever you can get it.
[02:16:12.717 --> 02:16:16.939]  Give us a call just as soon as you can, 800-409-5633.
[02:16:16.939 --> 02:16:18.799]  I need these dadgum phone lines flooded.
[02:16:18.799 --> 02:16:20.400]  We'll gear up.
[02:16:20.400 --> 02:16:32.865]  But I'm telling you, Alex, this is absolutely... If there's one damn bit of patriotism in any of our families out there, they gotta move to survive.
[02:16:32.865 --> 02:16:37.667]  Because unless these families survive, we won't have people left to take this thing back when it goes down.
[02:16:38.570 --> 02:16:39.691]  Well, that's the good news.
[02:16:39.691 --> 02:16:42.792]  The silver lining throughout history with remnants.
[02:16:42.792 --> 02:16:43.833]  God warns his people.
[02:16:43.833 --> 02:16:47.395]  People that, you know, read the Bible, they know that you've always got to be prepared.
[02:16:47.395 --> 02:16:52.738]  They follow that and they're always a lot better off than the wicked that laugh at us.
[02:16:52.738 --> 02:16:55.860]  Some people are still laughing, Steve, and I just can't believe their ignorance.
[02:16:56.680 --> 02:17:00.004]  Well, I guess I can believe it.
[02:17:00.004 --> 02:17:02.866]  I see what we've got running for president both ways.
[02:17:02.866 --> 02:17:10.613]  But the fact is, is that this issue this morning, I can't emphasize to our listeners enough, Alex.
[02:17:11.614 --> 02:17:15.575]  They absolutely must move now.
[02:17:15.575 --> 02:17:20.836]  Every asset, resource they can put together, food is going to be the only medium of exchange.
[02:17:20.836 --> 02:17:28.458]  Hey, I get so busy fighting them that I've bought food for family and stuff that didn't care, didn't know, now they appreciate it.
[02:17:28.458 --> 02:17:33.179]  I bought food for family that did know but couldn't afford it, and so I don't even have enough for myself.
[02:17:33.179 --> 02:17:37.240]  You know, I've bought many times from you, but listen, you put me first in a three-year supply
[02:17:38.041 --> 02:17:42.050]  Uh, I can only afford a two year supply for three people.
[02:17:42.050 --> 02:17:43.914]  No, we got three years packed and on its way.
[02:17:44.582 --> 02:17:51.344]  Okay, Steve, give people the number, give them the website.
[02:17:51.344 --> 02:17:57.625]  It's 800-409-5633, 800-409-5633, for those of you that are not computer conscious.
[02:17:57.625 --> 02:18:05.627]  For those of you that can get on a stinking computer, get on efoodsdirect.com, efoodsdirect.com.
[02:18:05.627 --> 02:18:10.008]  If you have any difficulties, give us a call at the 800 number, we'll call you back.
[02:18:10.008 --> 02:18:12.169]  But get it done, and get it done now.
[02:18:13.138 --> 02:18:17.001]  By the way, the stock market is plunging right now.
[02:18:17.001 --> 02:18:18.242]  Absolutely.
[02:18:18.242 --> 02:18:25.328]  It has plunged 80-something points just in the last 30 minutes, less than 30 minutes, almost 30, since they did this.
[02:18:25.328 --> 02:18:31.654]  It's going straight down right now, and it'll go up and down before.
[02:18:31.654 --> 02:18:37.358]  This means total inflation, and again, it's more like 99% of the phone calls they got in emails.
[02:18:37.358 --> 02:18:39.020]  I've had congresspeople on, it's been in the news.
[02:18:39.660 --> 02:18:44.367]  I mean, people talk about 9,000 phone calls a day and five of them are for it.
[02:18:44.367 --> 02:18:49.614]  Another congressman on the show said 2,000 plus phone calls and six calls were for it.
[02:18:49.614 --> 02:18:54.020]  I mean, they just don't care because they were told martial law.
[02:18:54.020 --> 02:18:55.662]  Go up to InfoWars.com, did you know?
[02:18:56.334 --> 02:18:59.858]  This isn't the one earlier on Monday the congressman that was threatening martial law in the House.
[02:18:59.858 --> 02:19:04.223]  They threatened nationwide martial law and basically removing the Congress.
[02:19:04.223 --> 02:19:05.625]  Total dictatorship.
[02:19:05.625 --> 02:19:07.267]  Well that is a dictatorship that does that.
[02:19:07.267 --> 02:19:09.570]  So they gave in and this is martial law.
[02:19:11.411 --> 02:19:13.052]  Give them the number again, Steve.
[02:19:13.052 --> 02:19:13.233]  800-409-5633.
[02:19:13.233 --> 02:19:18.197]  And on the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[02:19:18.197 --> 02:19:19.418]  Alex, I appreciate you.
[02:19:19.418 --> 02:19:20.559]  We got it going.
[02:19:20.559 --> 02:19:24.262]  Big banners at the top of infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:19:24.262 --> 02:19:26.183]  If you forget the address, efoodsdirect.com.
[02:19:26.183 --> 02:19:27.845]  The number one more time, Steve.
[02:19:27.845 --> 02:19:28.345]  800-409-5633.
[02:19:28.345 --> 02:19:34.170]  Alright, we're going to come back with a lot more news and information and several congressmen lined up.
[02:19:34.170 --> 02:19:34.590]  Stay with us.
[02:19:34.590 --> 02:19:35.571]  Transmission straight ahead.
[02:19:38.172 --> 02:19:44.117]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[02:19:44.117 --> 02:19:48.920]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[02:19:48.920 --> 02:19:54.344]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[02:19:54.344 --> 02:19:57.767]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[02:19:58.247 --> 02:20:06.770]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[02:20:06.770 --> 02:20:12.572]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[02:20:12.572 --> 02:20:18.554]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[02:20:18.554 --> 02:20:20.875]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[02:20:21.155 --> 02:20:23.819]  Cannot survive in an alkaline environment?
[02:20:23.819 --> 02:20:29.568]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to AlkaVision.com.
[02:20:29.568 --> 02:20:32.051]  That's A-L-K-A Vision dot com.
[02:20:32.051 --> 02:20:33.073]  Or call 269-344-3420 today!
[02:20:38.024 --> 02:20:44.787]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:20:44.787 --> 02:20:47.429]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:20:47.429 --> 02:20:48.970]  But who is the enemy?
[02:20:48.970 --> 02:20:49.770]  Bin Laden.
[02:20:49.770 --> 02:20:50.771]  This is his ammo.
[02:20:50.771 --> 02:20:52.111]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:20:52.111 --> 02:20:53.592]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:20:54.113 --> 02:21:01.280]  Pabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:21:01.280 --> 02:21:01.761]  Some U.S.
[02:21:01.761 --> 02:21:08.108]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:21:08.108 --> 02:21:11.572]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:21:11.792 --> 02:21:22.080]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:21:22.080 --> 02:21:23.320]  Fabled enemies.
[02:21:23.320 --> 02:21:31.066]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:21:31.066 --> 02:21:34.429]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:21:38.163 --> 02:21:41.686]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:21:41.686 --> 02:21:47.090]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[02:21:47.090 --> 02:21:52.254]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[02:21:52.254 --> 02:22:03.363]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[02:22:03.763 --> 02:22:09.550]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:22:09.550 --> 02:22:15.817]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:22:15.817 --> 02:22:16.859]  What about you?
[02:22:16.859 --> 02:22:18.781]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.

[02:22:37.426 --> 02:22:37.746]  Let's do it!
[02:22:54.940 --> 02:22:55.380]  I think so.
[02:23:17.346 --> 02:23:17.606]  I think so.
[02:23:54.704 --> 02:23:59.169]  Congressman Dan Hamburg popping in at T-minus 8 minutes.
[02:23:59.169 --> 02:24:03.734]  Congressman Brad Sherman coming up in 45 minutes.
[02:24:03.734 --> 02:24:07.558]  Ron Paul, very close to getting him.
[02:24:07.558 --> 02:24:12.464]  The comment on House approves bailout for financial markets.
[02:24:15.160 --> 02:24:25.825]  The House approves a revised 700 million financial rescue package, really 800-something billion, ending a week-long battle over controversial measure after lawmakers came under pressure to head off a growing financial crisis.
[02:24:25.825 --> 02:24:32.668]  You just heard the former head of the Treasury, former head of policy, tell you it's a complete fraud, will not help the economy, it's for the elite, not for the people.
[02:24:32.668 --> 02:24:34.069]  We are in deep trouble.
[02:24:34.069 --> 02:24:35.790]  The plan, which was already approved by the Senate,
[02:24:36.510 --> 02:24:43.891]  It would allow the government to spend billions of dollars to buy bad mortgage-related securities and other devalued assets from troubled financial institutions.
[02:24:43.891 --> 02:24:51.553]  If it works, advocates say, that would allow frozen credit to begin flowing again and prevent a serious recession.
[02:24:51.553 --> 02:24:52.593]  But!
[02:24:52.593 --> 02:24:55.133]  Let's give you the facts now.
[02:24:55.133 --> 02:24:56.974]  It does nothing to help the people.
[02:24:56.974 --> 02:24:58.754]  It will devalue the dollar faster.
[02:24:58.754 --> 02:25:01.994]  It will devalue the U.S.
[02:25:01.994 --> 02:25:04.635]  international rating from AAA down to junk, probably.
[02:25:06.144 --> 02:25:09.766]  And martial law was threatened.
[02:25:09.766 --> 02:25:23.075]  If you tuned in earlier in the week and heard Congressman Dan on, or you heard Congressman Burgess on, they were discussing how they were threatened with martial law in the House.
[02:25:23.075 --> 02:25:26.497]  Basically weren't allowed into meetings, police state actions.
[02:25:26.497 --> 02:25:32.081]  Now, congressmen are being threatened with open, physical, martial law.
[02:25:33.160 --> 02:25:42.065]  They were threatened with physical martial law, just as the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and others have been saying they could act outside Congress.
[02:25:42.065 --> 02:25:43.626]  That is martial law.
[02:25:43.626 --> 02:25:58.714]  Now they've been given financial immunity from their crimes, the power to buy, sell anything they want, to basically take over more of the economy and enfunnel the imploding economy through themselves in an IMF World Bank receivership move.
[02:25:58.714 --> 02:26:01.416]  Play Congressman Shepard.
[02:26:02.546 --> 02:26:05.208]  This is Congressman Shepard on C-SPAN.
[02:26:05.208 --> 02:26:08.089]  Ladies and gentlemen, in the last 24 hours, here it is.
[02:26:08.089 --> 02:26:14.453]  The only way they can pass this bill is by creating and sustaining a panic atmosphere.
[02:26:14.453 --> 02:26:17.755]  That atmosphere is not justified.
[02:26:17.755 --> 02:26:31.003]  Many of us were told in private conversations that if we voted against this bill on Monday, that the sky would fall, the market would drop two or three thousand points the first day, another couple thousand the second day,
[02:26:31.756 --> 02:26:38.778]  And a few members were even told that there would be martial law in America if we voted no.
[02:26:38.778 --> 02:26:41.239]  That's what I call fear-mongering.
[02:26:41.239 --> 02:26:42.599]  Unjustified.
[02:26:42.599 --> 02:26:43.960]  Proven wrong.
[02:26:43.960 --> 02:26:47.721]  We've got a week, we've got two weeks to write a good bill.
[02:26:47.721 --> 02:26:52.442]  The only way to write, to pass a bad bill, keep the panic pressure on.
[02:26:52.442 --> 02:26:56.684]  Now what has the Senate done to this bill?
[02:26:56.684 --> 02:27:01.045]  And ladies and gentlemen, they couldn't remove the pork, but forget the tens of billions
[02:27:02.068 --> 02:27:07.934]  Well, it's $150 billion in pork stacked on the $70 billion, $700 billion.
[02:27:07.934 --> 02:27:13.400]  Now, with the old $700 billion bill, Bloomberg and others said it was really $5 trillion.
[02:27:13.400 --> 02:27:23.090]  So if they went from $700 billion that was really $5 trillion to $850 something billion, I guess that makes it more like $6.5 trillion.
[02:27:25.837 --> 02:27:39.291]  A six and a half trillion dollar transfer from the real economy into the very blood sucking Rothschild Rockefeller banks that have engineered all this and have sucked all these third world countries dry and are now doing it to us and it's going to devalue your currency.
[02:27:40.001 --> 02:27:42.163]  It is going to destroy the stock market.
[02:27:42.163 --> 02:27:43.564]  You watch it happen!
[02:27:43.564 --> 02:27:45.705]  And as it gets worse, they'll say, oh, it's getting worse.
[02:27:45.705 --> 02:27:46.386]  Give us more money.
[02:27:46.386 --> 02:27:47.046]  Give us more power.
[02:27:47.046 --> 02:27:47.947]  We'll fix it.
[02:27:47.947 --> 02:27:48.927]  Then they get it.
[02:27:48.927 --> 02:27:50.228]  Oh, we give us more money, more power.
[02:27:50.228 --> 02:27:51.489]  They don't even need that now.
[02:27:51.489 --> 02:27:55.052]  They have been given martial law powers economically.
[02:27:55.052 --> 02:27:57.373]  The Congress mindlessly signed it away.
[02:27:57.373 --> 02:28:03.378]  And now under Peter 51 Bush and others or Barack Obama or McCain or whoever comes into office can say or do whatever they want.
[02:28:03.378 --> 02:28:07.701]  They're total puppets.
[02:28:07.701 --> 02:28:09.402]  This is so massive.
[02:28:12.259 --> 02:28:19.042]  This is financial martial law, in the words of Dr. Paul Rick Roberts earlier, concurring with me, saying, yes, this is the equivalent of martial law.
[02:28:19.042 --> 02:28:23.443]  So they said, we'll declare martial law on you if you don't do this.
[02:28:23.443 --> 02:28:27.445]  And in the bill is martial law financially, which runs and controls everything.
[02:28:27.445 --> 02:28:30.166]  I heard Dr. Roberts say, that's everything anyways.
[02:28:30.166 --> 02:28:41.370]  And the same week, they activate a brigade, and they say they're going to rotate in more brigades for NORTHCOM, for domestic operations, for quote, civil unrest, microwave guns, and they say, we hope we don't have to shoot Americans with bullets.
[02:28:42.941 --> 02:28:47.782]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:28:47.782 --> 02:28:51.163]  I mean, this is just absolutely amazing.
[02:28:51.163 --> 02:28:56.004]  Like Ron Paul said a few months ago on this show, he said, something big's coming, a total worldwide meltdown.
[02:28:56.004 --> 02:28:59.765]  He's been saying it for 30 years and then he said it's here.
[02:28:59.765 --> 02:29:01.506]  And the very bastards
[02:29:02.859 --> 02:29:05.601]  That orchestrated it all, now get even more power.
[02:29:05.601 --> 02:29:11.305]  And it didn't matter if 90 plus percent of the phone calls and emails said, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:29:11.305 --> 02:29:13.346]  Thousands of calls to one.
[02:29:13.346 --> 02:29:14.267]  They don't care!
[02:29:14.267 --> 02:29:19.951]  They say, we are doing what we want.
[02:29:19.951 --> 02:29:28.097]  This is a government that's launched anthrax attacks, 9-11, illegal wars, they're a pack of criminals, and you're seeing it right now.
[02:29:28.097 --> 02:29:29.037]  We're on the march.
[02:29:29.037 --> 02:29:30.999]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:31.969 --> 02:29:38.092]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:38.092 --> 02:29:41.293]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[02:29:41.293 --> 02:29:43.675]  I've come with a message of information.
[02:29:43.675 --> 02:29:45.215]  9-11 was an inside job.
[02:29:45.215 --> 02:29:46.516]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[02:29:46.516 --> 02:29:48.177]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[02:29:48.177 --> 02:29:51.078]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[02:29:51.078 --> 02:29:54.700]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[02:30:04.350 --> 02:30:09.300]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[02:30:17.113 --> 02:30:20.534]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[02:30:20.534 --> 02:30:23.175]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[02:30:23.175 --> 02:30:29.916]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[02:31:04.144 --> 02:31:06.265]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[02:31:06.265 --> 02:31:07.245]  this fall?

[02:31:44.451 --> 02:31:47.495]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:31:47.495 --> 02:31:50.718]  It's not who votes that counts, it's who counts the votes.

[02:33:29.566 --> 02:33:32.167]  Global shortwave on WWCR.

[02:33:47.296 --> 02:33:48.397]  And I'm not tooting our horn.
[02:33:48.397 --> 02:34:00.707]  I'm letting people realize with just this one radio show and others out there and other websites and other great people, we are carrying the message of truth to the people and they're listening like never before.
[02:34:00.707 --> 02:34:04.611]  Ron Paul coming up sometime in the next hour and a half for a quick interview.
[02:34:05.571 --> 02:34:10.294]  We have Congressman Brad Sherman who was told this has to be passed, or martial law.
[02:34:10.294 --> 02:34:16.398]  Not martial law with the House rules, like we heard from a congressman from North Texas, Burgess, on Monday.
[02:34:16.398 --> 02:34:18.059]  National martial law.
[02:34:18.059 --> 02:34:26.724]  NORTHCOM announcing they are going to use TRIPS domestically, activated brigades, not just one but multiple brigades, for continutive government, for civil unrest.
[02:34:29.059 --> 02:34:30.000]  This is the takeover.
[02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:31.581]  You're seeing what happened in Nazi Germany.
[02:34:31.581 --> 02:34:32.841]  You're seeing what happened in Russia.
[02:34:32.841 --> 02:34:34.583]  You're seeing what happened with Pol Pot.
[02:34:34.583 --> 02:34:36.024]  I mean, this is it.
[02:34:36.024 --> 02:34:37.044]  We have to get the word out.
[02:34:37.044 --> 02:34:38.285]  We have to say no.
[02:34:38.285 --> 02:34:39.166]  We have to stop them.
[02:34:39.166 --> 02:34:40.687]  They engineered all this.
[02:34:40.687 --> 02:34:48.632]  And a man who valiantly exposed this over a year ago is Congressman Dan Hamburg.
[02:34:49.677 --> 02:35:15.214]  uh... from northern california federal congressman on several terms uh... now out of the uh... congress and he wrote a detailed report that we have a link to in the story the curtain memo wrote about this on info wars dot com read it carefully this is a san francisco chronicle picked up by other newspapers across the world because he's highly respected and uh... he started out with this quote rule by fear or rule by law
[02:35:17.250 --> 02:35:30.407]  The power of the executive to cast a man into prison without formulating any charge known to law, and particularly to deny him the judgment of his peers, is the highest degree of odious and is the foundation of all totalitarian governments, whether Nazi or Communist.
[02:35:30.407 --> 02:35:32.410]  Winston Churchill, November 21st, 1943.
[02:35:35.815 --> 02:35:56.564]  And then he goes through the systematic takeover, PDD 51, John Warren Defense Authorization Act, the Military Commissions Act, and then you've got all these covert operations of military buying off mayors and police chiefs that we've interviewed and brought on air about Delta Force and CIA showing up with bags of money saying, just be friends with us with what's coming.
[02:35:56.564 --> 02:36:04.447]  Governor Ventura, first day, this is years ago, as a governor, is called down into the basement, 23 CIA agents, not telling him who their names are.
[02:36:05.854 --> 02:36:08.556]  Black Ops are all around us, folks.
[02:36:08.556 --> 02:36:10.297]  This is the military-industrial complex.
[02:36:10.297 --> 02:36:23.725]  Just like in third world countries, the juntas, where the military takes over, or Roman Caesars being overthrown on a monthly basis in the deep decline before the sack in 410 by Alaric, overthrows every month by the generals.
[02:36:23.725 --> 02:36:24.626]  I mean, this is what
[02:36:25.856 --> 02:36:32.939]  Caesar did 2040-something years ago when he passed the Rubicon and brought his troops into Rome.
[02:36:32.939 --> 02:36:35.221]  Of course, that river in the north up by Austria.
[02:36:35.221 --> 02:36:37.262]  That's what it means to cross the Rubicon.
[02:36:37.262 --> 02:36:39.162]  So I've given you some background here.
[02:36:39.162 --> 02:36:41.183]  This is really happening!
[02:36:41.183 --> 02:36:44.425]  And it's being done, not in slow motion, but in medium motion.
[02:36:44.425 --> 02:36:45.365]  We can't accept it.
[02:36:45.365 --> 02:36:47.166]  We can't go along with it.
[02:36:47.166 --> 02:36:50.988]  To recap, 35 minutes ago, no, exactly 37 minutes ago, the house passed.
[02:36:55.965 --> 02:37:02.513]  Under threat of economic terrorism, when the Plunge Protection Team didn't bail out the stock market as they do daily.
[02:37:02.513 --> 02:37:06.317]  And so it plunged $1,200,000,000 plus in one day on Monday.
[02:37:06.317 --> 02:37:07.618]  That terrorizing didn't work.
[02:37:07.618 --> 02:37:10.482]  Still 90-plus percent against the Banker Empowerment Bill.
[02:37:12.383 --> 02:37:13.665]  The economic takeover bill.
[02:37:13.665 --> 02:37:15.047]  We're going to the Congressman here in just a moment.
[02:37:15.047 --> 02:37:16.108]  I want to recap all this.
[02:37:16.108 --> 02:37:16.990]  This is historic.
[02:37:16.990 --> 02:37:20.374]  I want to get his take on it and how we stop it and turn it around.
[02:37:20.374 --> 02:37:24.681]  And then they told Congress, they said, you pass this or physical martial law will come.
[02:37:24.681 --> 02:37:28.366]  They were told this last night and today and the House passed it under duress.
[02:37:29.187 --> 02:37:31.188]  This ties into everything we've seen.
[02:37:31.188 --> 02:37:35.289]  The clearly launched White House anthrax attacks on Congress.
[02:37:35.289 --> 02:37:36.250]  Folks, my life's in danger.
[02:37:36.250 --> 02:37:37.610]  I'm getting death threats every day now.
[02:37:37.610 --> 02:37:38.471]  Other people are.
[02:37:38.471 --> 02:37:39.731]  This is happening.
[02:37:39.731 --> 02:37:40.531]  You understand?
[02:37:40.531 --> 02:37:42.272]  This is red level.
[02:37:42.272 --> 02:37:43.773]  America is being taken over.
[02:37:43.773 --> 02:37:45.493]  We've got to say no now.
[02:37:45.493 --> 02:37:49.195]  The good news is 90 plus percent are against it and are hopping mad now.
[02:37:49.195 --> 02:37:51.056]  So this government's totally illegitimate.
[02:37:51.056 --> 02:37:52.916]  This vote is illegitimate.
[02:37:52.916 --> 02:37:54.197]  And this is just so amazing.
[02:37:54.197 --> 02:37:56.578]  And now they've got martial law economic powers.
[02:37:57.418 --> 02:37:59.860]  It's right there in the bill in the subsections for the private bankers.
[02:37:59.860 --> 02:38:02.101]  It only protects them, not the people.
[02:38:02.101 --> 02:38:10.726]  Congressman Dan Hamburg, who warned us again in February of last year, more than a year ago, rule by fear, rule by law.
[02:38:10.726 --> 02:38:11.747]  It's happening, sir.
[02:38:11.747 --> 02:38:13.788]  It could get a lot worse.
[02:38:13.788 --> 02:38:18.892]  Break down what it's like to see this happening and go through the points.
[02:38:18.892 --> 02:38:25.756]  Well, you know, this is not something that really should surprise people, but I think the heartening thing is that
[02:38:27.060 --> 02:38:47.109]  The calls that were going into congressional offices were anywhere from 50 to 100 to 1 against this, so I think it's clear that people are finally waking up to the loss of the Constitution, the loss of sovereignty, and also the way this government has set things up
[02:38:48.041 --> 02:38:54.165]  In the way they have in order to systematically tank the economy.
[02:38:54.165 --> 02:39:01.669]  Now, the thing that I'm looking at now, we've got 30 days until a presidential election.
[02:39:01.669 --> 02:39:04.231]  What will happen in those 30 days?
[02:39:04.231 --> 02:39:14.257]  And is the current cabal that's in charge, is the neocon cabal, willing to take the risk of turning this over?
[02:39:15.350 --> 02:39:17.011]  You know, to the Democratic Party.
[02:39:17.011 --> 02:39:22.354]  I mean, we know the Democratic Party is not significantly different from the Republicans.
[02:39:22.354 --> 02:39:32.739]  But still, I have to wonder if there is another surprise in store for us in the month of October besides this.
[02:39:32.739 --> 02:39:41.983]  It's not clear at all that the markets are going to be responsive to this because the underlying economy is what is messed up in this country.
[02:39:41.983 --> 02:39:43.384]  You know, it's the foreclosures.
[02:39:43.971 --> 02:39:46.973]  It's the loss of employment.
[02:39:46.973 --> 02:39:49.755]  It's the fact that the infrastructure of the country is crumbling.
[02:39:49.755 --> 02:39:51.376]  The educational system is crumbling.
[02:39:51.376 --> 02:39:53.437]  The healthcare system is crumbling.
[02:39:53.437 --> 02:40:04.444]  So whether this bailout, it's certainly going to be good for investment bankers and for the confidence on Wall Street in the short term.
[02:40:04.444 --> 02:40:11.789]  But I'm not at all sure that we're not going to see another big surprise in the next month.
[02:40:12.188 --> 02:40:26.223]  And one of those possible surprises, I think, is kind of a Hail Mary pass kind of thing from Cheney and his group inside the administration.
[02:40:26.223 --> 02:40:32.089]  I think back to what happened with the missing nukes from the Air Force Base in North Dakota
[02:40:32.775 --> 02:40:47.064]  I think to the assassination in Houston a couple months ago of a top CIA operative, Roland Carnaby, who was trying to stop a possible false flag attack on the port of Houston.
[02:40:47.064 --> 02:40:52.348]  And I just, you know, I think now that the American people are pretty much
[02:40:55.032 --> 02:41:02.875]  Uncertain of everything that's going on and you know I think about Naomi Klein and her shock doctrine theory.
[02:41:02.875 --> 02:41:19.801]  I think people are in shock right now and that this is the time that people like Cheney most take advantage of that shock to manipulate public opinion and to do what they want to do and to pursue their globalist
[02:41:21.474 --> 02:41:28.819]  You know, agenda which is way beyond anything that the American people would normally tolerate.
[02:41:28.819 --> 02:41:29.419]  Absolutely.
[02:41:29.419 --> 02:41:36.024]  We're seeing things happen on a daily basis that would have shaken the political system to its core just a decade ago.
[02:41:36.024 --> 02:41:49.753]  I mean, from torturing children in front of their parents, to domestic spying on the American people, to the military spying on peace groups, to FEMA camps, to being built openly and being in the newspaper, to just absolute
[02:41:50.683 --> 02:41:55.367]  Crazy corruption, but the good news is it did come out with Cy Hirsch.
[02:41:55.367 --> 02:42:07.256]  It did come out on MSNBC that Cheney, just three months ago, was planning to paint up US Navy patrol boats like Iranian boats and have Navy SEALs launch sneak attacks on larger US ships in the
[02:42:08.417 --> 02:42:11.298]  Also understanding, Alex, that false flag terrorism is nothing new.
[02:42:11.298 --> 02:42:13.279]  I mean, suddenly people are
[02:42:28.536 --> 02:42:45.872]  I'm looking back to the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution and I'm looking back to, you know, the Kennedy assassination and, you know, things start to fall into place and it's like the scales begin to fall from the eyes and people go, aha, this is the kind of country I've been living in all these years.
[02:42:45.872 --> 02:42:54.780]  And where they have this propaganda that's been put out by the elites, been all about, and, you know, that is a very encouraging thing.
[02:42:55.225 --> 02:43:07.629]  But one of the problems, and we know it's one of the big problems, and programs like yours battle against that problem, which is that people still mostly get garbage information from the mainstream media.
[02:43:07.629 --> 02:43:09.130]  Or they get sucked into it.
[02:43:09.130 --> 02:43:11.711]  And the corporate media is corporate controlled.
[02:43:11.711 --> 02:43:18.733]  And you know what is so vital is getting information to people, because the more people that understand what's going on,
[02:43:19.215 --> 02:43:27.638]  The more people there are who are going to stand up and say, no way, not in my name will you commit these corrupt and heinous acts.
[02:43:27.638 --> 02:43:29.879]  Well, I want your take on two things.
[02:43:29.879 --> 02:43:33.240]  A, is this not incredibly revealing and a huge wake-up call?
[02:43:33.240 --> 02:43:34.080]  That's what we're seeing.
[02:43:34.080 --> 02:43:36.301]  People are already waking up and already angry.
[02:43:37.602 --> 02:43:55.455]  They are really waking up now and are really upset at the fact that on average, 95% according to the polls, congressmen and women have said they'll get $2,000, $3,000, $9,000 in one senator from California saying no to the bailout and it still happens.
[02:43:55.455 --> 02:44:02.420]  That's revealing that this establishment doesn't care what the people want or what the people say or even what is constitutional.
[02:44:02.420 --> 02:44:03.861]  And secondarily, I want your comment on that.
[02:44:03.861 --> 02:44:04.381]  Secondarily,
[02:44:05.282 --> 02:44:08.264]  We have open economic terrorism.
[02:44:08.264 --> 02:44:17.810]  Since when do Presidents and Secretaries of Treasury and Democratic leaders scream, you better give us this power under the bailout or there'll be a depression?
[02:44:17.810 --> 02:44:21.392]  That is pure economic terrorism.
[02:44:21.392 --> 02:44:30.238]  Yeah, but we're getting used to that because that's the kind of thing that they did to get us into the Iraq War and that's the kind of thing they do to
[02:44:31.488 --> 02:44:39.910]  You know, when Katrina's hit by a hurricane, you know, what they do is to keep us in a state of shock and confusion.
[02:44:39.910 --> 02:44:46.592]  And I'm really disappointed actually this morning to see 271 votes in favor of this bailout in spite of the fact
[02:44:50.134 --> 02:44:50.234]  Yes.
[02:45:06.172 --> 02:45:13.500]  I mean, I think what we'll see is that a lot of people aren't going to turn out and vote because they're going to go, you know, this government is too corrupt.
[02:45:27.538 --> 02:45:35.781]  And they're, you know, they'll just say, well, I just won't vote this year for a member of Congress who would betray me in this sense.
[02:45:35.781 --> 02:45:42.303]  But I don't see where it's going to mean a substantial shift in governance in the country.
[02:45:42.303 --> 02:45:51.086]  I mean, I don't think the next Congress is going to be significantly different than this one, you know, because of this particular vote or because of
[02:45:51.613 --> 02:45:55.378]  A series of bad votes which have happened over the past several years.
[02:45:59.022 --> 02:46:01.945]  I want to finish playing this clip.
[02:46:01.945 --> 02:46:06.708]  You haven't had a chance to hear it, and then I'll let you finish what you were saying.
[02:46:06.708 --> 02:46:13.874]  This is the Congressman, and this was, and he's coming up, Congressman Brad Sherman next hour.
[02:46:13.874 --> 02:46:21.640]  This is what he said other members of Congress were told, physical martial law in America if they didn't pass this.
[02:46:21.640 --> 02:46:23.381]  Okay, this is official.
[02:46:23.381 --> 02:46:23.822]  Here it is.
[02:46:24.724 --> 02:46:31.066]  The only way they can pass this bill is by creating and sustaining a panic atmosphere.
[02:46:31.066 --> 02:46:34.367]  That atmosphere is not justified.
[02:46:34.367 --> 02:46:54.194]  Many of us were told in private conversations that if we voted against this bill on Monday, that the sky would fall, the market would drop two or three thousand points the first day, another couple thousand the second day, and a few members were even told that there would be martial law in America if we voted no.
[02:46:55.419 --> 02:46:57.861]  That's what I call fear-mongering.
[02:46:57.861 --> 02:46:59.223]  Unjustified.
[02:46:59.223 --> 02:47:00.584]  Proven wrong.
[02:47:00.584 --> 02:47:04.327]  We've got a week, we've got two weeks to write a good bill.
[02:47:04.327 --> 02:47:09.071]  The only way to write, to pass a bad bill, keep the panic pressure on.
[02:47:09.071 --> 02:47:11.554]  Now, what has the Senate done to this bill?
[02:47:11.554 --> 02:47:13.816]  Congressman Dan Hamburg, your comments on that.
[02:47:13.816 --> 02:47:21.322]  You know, I'm afraid that the majority, the great majority of people, not only citizens of this country, but members of the U.S.
[02:47:21.322 --> 02:47:21.783]  Congress,
[02:47:22.219 --> 02:47:43.053]  We're not aware that on August 28th, just about six weeks ago, Bush extended for the seventh time the national state of emergency under which this country has been de facto governed ever since September 11th or September 14th, depending on which document you look at, of 2001.
[02:47:43.053 --> 02:47:48.657]  Bush has extended that state of national emergency under which he implements
[02:47:49.238 --> 02:48:00.828]  Documents like the National Emergencies Act, but more importantly, Homeland Security, Presidential Directive 20, National Security Directive 51, under which economic
[02:48:05.572 --> 02:48:11.838]  The problems are one of the reasons for the declaration of martial law.
[02:48:11.838 --> 02:48:18.224]  So these measures are actually in effect and have been in effect for seven or eight years.
[02:48:18.224 --> 02:48:22.387]  So people should not look at this and say, oh, martial law, no way.
[02:48:22.387 --> 02:48:27.812]  We have been in that state ever since the attacks of 9-11.
[02:48:28.988 --> 02:48:41.322]  And that is why there is nothing more important to the consciousness of the people of this country than the 9-11 Truth Movement and getting to the bottom of what has instigated this eight-year reign of terror.
[02:48:45.066 --> 02:48:50.650]  Again, going back to economic terrorism, they need this implosion now to get the powers they need.
[02:48:50.650 --> 02:48:53.432]  Just as PDD 51 says, it's clear.
[02:48:53.432 --> 02:48:56.555]  They start fear-mongering two weeks ago saying, depression, depression.
[02:48:56.555 --> 02:48:58.956]  It drives down the market and then they're given the power.
[02:48:58.956 --> 02:49:00.137]  I mean, it's transparent.
[02:49:00.137 --> 02:49:02.639]  They did this in front of everyone.
[02:49:02.639 --> 02:49:05.141]  This is incredibly criminal.
[02:49:05.141 --> 02:49:10.225]  This is an incredibly criminal act that they're doing and this shows me they're going for broke.
[02:49:10.225 --> 02:49:11.346]  I think this is just the start.
[02:49:11.907 --> 02:49:14.643]  And I think one way to look at it is this is kind of an economic 9-11.
[02:49:16.189 --> 02:49:27.512]  And I think they are going for broke in terms of destroying the American economy, so that they can come back with a whole new globalist approach and sell that to a desperate people.
[02:49:27.512 --> 02:49:31.713]  We'll start seeing things like the North American Union... They've already said that!
[02:49:31.713 --> 02:49:42.715]  They've already kissed your... The Amaro, you know, replacing the dollar, national sovereignty in the trash can, and these are things that normally people would not tolerate.
[02:49:43.075 --> 02:49:49.537]  But their idea is to get people in such a panic that they will look for the Savior.
[02:49:49.537 --> 02:49:56.320]  You know, this is Weimar Republic type stuff that we're going back to in the United States of America.
[02:49:56.320 --> 02:49:56.920]  Unbelievable.
[02:49:56.920 --> 02:49:57.580]  You're absolutely right.
[02:49:57.580 --> 02:49:58.020]  Stay there, sir.
[02:49:58.020 --> 02:49:59.061]  We're going to break.
[02:49:59.061 --> 02:50:04.943]  We have Congressman Dan Hamburg on with us, more congressmen coming up, sitting congressmen.
[02:50:04.943 --> 02:50:07.584]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is happening.
[02:50:07.584 --> 02:50:10.165]  Remember almost three years ago, we snuck into Bilderberg Group.
[02:50:10.825 --> 02:50:11.826]  We got the information out.
[02:50:11.826 --> 02:50:17.529]  We said they're going to start the implosion by restricting credit on the subprime mortgages.
[02:50:17.529 --> 02:50:18.790]  They are going to engineer this.
[02:50:18.790 --> 02:50:20.151]  We're on record.
[02:50:20.151 --> 02:50:20.631]  Okay?
[02:50:20.631 --> 02:50:22.392]  And now, how did it happen?
[02:50:22.392 --> 02:50:23.473]  Because they run things.
[02:50:23.473 --> 02:50:25.053]  They are orchestrating all of this.
[02:50:25.053 --> 02:50:30.277]  In fact, we're going to skip this break for the PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[02:50:30.277 --> 02:50:32.498]  Congressman, I'm going to skip this break so we don't waste any time.
[02:50:32.498 --> 02:50:33.619]  This is too important.
[02:50:33.619 --> 02:50:37.241]  So we're only here for the internet streams and the TV viewers.
[02:50:40.421 --> 02:50:46.705]  We also have a big story about a known government asset putting out a hoax that all the banks were going to close next week.
[02:50:46.705 --> 02:50:54.750]  I want to get your take on that later, but other points you want to make right now, sir, about ways to counter this and where you see this going?
[02:50:54.750 --> 02:50:59.853]  Well, I think the best way to counter this, as I said before, is information.
[02:50:59.853 --> 02:51:08.279]  And I think that the place we're really going to get into trouble, and I think they've already prepared themselves for this, is shutting down of the internet.
[02:51:09.228 --> 02:51:16.959]  And a Stanford professor recently said that this is in the works.
[02:51:17.549 --> 02:51:27.053]  And there is a plan for a so-called e-terror attack, which will necessitate the government taking much stricter control over the internet.
[02:51:27.053 --> 02:51:37.018]  So, that's something... That's right, he openly talked about it, internet too, that they're setting it all up, regulations, taxation.
[02:51:37.018 --> 02:51:43.300]  YouTube and Google have now accepted Senator Lieberman's deal that whatever the government says take off, they take off.
[02:51:43.300 --> 02:51:44.341]  I mean, it's already happening.
[02:51:45.069 --> 02:51:51.071]  Well, yeah, and it's much like the Patriot Act, which was all written and ready to go when 9-11 happened.
[02:51:51.071 --> 02:51:57.334]  Strangely enough, they had this, you know, thousand-plus page bill already written when 9-11 happened.
[02:51:57.334 --> 02:52:06.658]  And I think that is a tremendous threat, because I think the Internet is an incredible organizing tool right now that those of us who are
[02:52:08.757 --> 02:52:12.540]  You know, totally against what we see our government doing.
[02:52:12.540 --> 02:52:16.983]  I think this is the way we do pull ourselves together and communicate with each other.
[02:52:16.983 --> 02:52:31.154]  And even to the extent of, you know, the protests that went on around the country against this bailout bill were organized by, you know, one guy in New York City who put out an email to a bunch of his friends and the thing
[02:52:31.676 --> 02:52:33.718]  You know, just just mushroomed.
[02:52:33.718 --> 02:52:48.552]  And that's the way I see people taking to the streets in this country is communicating with each other through the Internet and setting up, you know, mass protests and mass actions, which which, you know, will they work?
[02:52:48.552 --> 02:52:49.193]  I don't know.
[02:52:49.193 --> 02:52:55.679]  But I do think people are getting to the point where, you know, they're just not going to sit back in their
[02:52:56.218 --> 02:52:56.679]  I think so.
[02:53:07.975 --> 02:53:13.920]  To try to shore up the economy of the country because they just don't have the money to spend any longer.
[02:53:13.920 --> 02:53:21.145]  So I think things are spiraling and I think things are happening very fast right now.
[02:53:21.145 --> 02:53:30.232]  But I think the good news is that the United States of America is going to have to pay the piper at some point.
[02:53:30.615 --> 02:53:35.760]  For all the things that have gone on in the last whatever, you know.
[02:53:35.760 --> 02:53:37.462]  Stay there, we're coming back with a full audience.
[02:53:37.462 --> 02:53:38.203]  Stay there, stay there.
[02:53:38.203 --> 02:53:38.423]  Here we go.
[02:53:43.258 --> 02:53:47.003]  Congressman Dan Hamburg is our guest.
[02:53:47.003 --> 02:53:50.207]  He's been predicting and writing about the martial law takeover.
[02:53:50.207 --> 02:53:52.210]  Something else is happening.
[02:53:52.210 --> 02:53:56.956]  I was at a little restaurant yesterday grabbing some tacos and I heard people talking about, did you hear?
[02:53:56.956 --> 02:53:58.598]  All the banks will be shut next week.
[02:53:58.598 --> 02:54:00.240]  Everything's going to shut down.
[02:54:00.240 --> 02:54:00.800]  It's over.
[02:54:00.800 --> 02:54:01.642]  Runs on the banks.
[02:54:02.551 --> 02:54:11.434]  And then I got back to the office and Rob was in there going, man, I'm getting all these emails from family and people that aren't even into this stuff about how all the banks are going to shut down next week.
[02:54:11.434 --> 02:54:12.795]  And it wouldn't really say where it was from.
[02:54:12.795 --> 02:54:18.957]  We tracked it back to a reported white supremacist who is a caricature of white supremacists.
[02:54:18.957 --> 02:54:22.699]  And I'm not defending white supremacists, but it's very clownish.
[02:54:22.699 --> 02:54:23.959]  And it's Hal Turner.
[02:54:23.959 --> 02:54:25.120]  I don't like giving the guy attention.
[02:54:26.730 --> 02:54:31.174]  And he says things that if I said them or somebody else said them, he'd be arrested.
[02:54:31.174 --> 02:54:43.224]  He says go blast judges, politicians, go physically attack people, names names, does ridiculous parodies of black people, calling them just every name in the book.
[02:54:45.166 --> 02:54:50.168]  And then of course it turns out that he's tied in with these white supremacist groups that it turned out the leaders are feds.
[02:54:50.168 --> 02:55:03.392]  And then it did come out, the story's up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and it's titled, a Paul Watson story, Hoax Bank Closure Story Peddles Bailout Propaganda.
[02:55:03.392 --> 02:55:09.955]  No surprise, we learned the source of the hoax is Hal Turner who was exposed earlier this year as an FBI informant.
[02:55:10.675 --> 02:55:25.225]  Posing as a white supremacist and he's the guy that comes out with with with Amaro coins that some private mint does and then discredits the fact that they are setting up an Amaro or he's the guy that hoax after hoax after hoax after hoax after hoax but the the the story he put out
[02:55:25.965 --> 02:55:29.747]  Says we've got to have the bailout or everything's destroyed.
[02:55:29.747 --> 02:55:31.787]  So it also always has an angle.
[02:55:31.787 --> 02:55:34.529]  Now this will be used to criticize the internet.
[02:55:34.529 --> 02:55:40.871]  CNN hired reporters to then put out fake stories about Steve Jobs having a heart attack yesterday.
[02:55:40.871 --> 02:55:44.153]  Now CNN's saying we better shut down the web and restrict free speech.
[02:55:44.153 --> 02:55:46.914]  Look what independent people do, but the guy works for them.
[02:55:47.634 --> 02:55:50.477]  And then they're also saying they want to shut the web down, censor it.
[02:55:50.477 --> 02:55:59.546]  We were just talking about it behind the scenes on the internet streams, and not just the MNFM, but during the break at PrisonPlanet.tv with our guest, the Congressman.
[02:55:59.546 --> 02:56:04.831]  So, Internet2, Lieberman, YouTube, and Google are now banning whatever the government wants.
[02:56:05.311 --> 02:56:06.152]  Well, I think that's right.
[02:56:06.152 --> 02:56:07.813]  You know, I think the worse it gets, the more people panic.
[02:56:27.135 --> 02:56:34.974]  And we know from Hitler's minister of propaganda, Joseph Goebbels, that there's nothing that makes people more malleable than when they're in a state of panic.
[02:56:35.467 --> 02:56:40.592]  And they want, you know, anything that will relieve their panic, they will go for.
[02:56:40.592 --> 02:56:43.115]  And this is the bet that they're making.
[02:56:43.115 --> 02:56:58.190]  They're believing that if they, you know, they've already shredded the Constitution, and they believe that now if they, you know, tank the economy, they will frighten people, and then they will come up with their plan to save them.
[02:56:59.864 --> 02:57:12.317]  And it'll be us, the people, the citizens of this country, the people who with our taxes have been supporting this entire charade, who are going to be left with basically nothing.
[02:57:17.501 --> 02:57:31.347]  All of us ordinary people are in a subservient position where we no longer really have anything to say about the way we're governed and we enter this new world order in which the global economy
[02:57:31.867 --> 02:57:39.173]  And a small financial, military, political, industrial elite makes all the decisions for the rest of us.
[02:57:39.173 --> 02:57:48.121]  And really, you know, some people have said that the problem with this bailout is that, you know, we have capitalism on the way up and socialism on the way down.
[02:57:48.121 --> 02:57:54.887]  But the characterization that makes more sense to me is that we're now in an area of authoritarian capitalism.
[02:57:54.887 --> 02:57:55.548]  Absolutely.
[02:57:55.548 --> 02:57:58.070]  And the people are not the authorities.
[02:57:58.470 --> 02:57:59.031]  That's right.
[02:57:59.031 --> 02:58:05.298]  They privatize profit and they socialize loss and they pass it on to the average people.
[02:58:05.298 --> 02:58:06.319]  It's feudalism.
[02:58:06.319 --> 02:58:06.739]  Stay there.
[02:58:06.739 --> 02:58:10.924]  We'll be back in one minute for five more minutes with our guest.

[02:59:36.007 --> 02:59:40.071]  We are now into our number four.
[02:59:40.071 --> 02:59:43.114]  Coming up in about 15 minutes, Congressman Brad Sherman.
[02:59:43.114 --> 02:59:47.899]  It was told, vote for this or we'll declare physical martial law.
[02:59:47.899 --> 02:59:53.704]  Ron Paul, probably popping in, to comment on the bailout passing.
[02:59:53.704 --> 02:59:56.006]  This is the banker takeover.
[02:59:56.006 --> 02:59:58.088]  Former Congressman Dan Hamburg joins us.
[02:59:59.164 --> 03:00:05.635]  Read major articles from major publications detailing how they were planning this controlled financial implosion 16 months ago.
[03:00:05.635 --> 03:00:08.420]  It was one of the bigger ones in the San Francisco Chronicle.
[03:00:09.718 --> 03:00:11.679]  He's with us for about five more minutes.
[03:00:11.679 --> 03:00:13.580]  You heard him say they're coming after the web.
[03:00:13.580 --> 03:00:14.620]  They're attacking the web.
[03:00:14.620 --> 03:00:16.181]  That's their main target.
[03:00:16.181 --> 03:00:18.662]  And a false flag attack that's even come out in mainstream news.
[03:00:18.662 --> 03:00:21.003]  They launch regulations, taxes.
[03:00:21.003 --> 03:00:22.183]  It's all happening.
[03:00:22.183 --> 03:00:30.647]  And they have their reported agents, FBI informant, their reported FBI informant, putting out a hoax that's gotten traction I've never seen.
[03:00:30.647 --> 03:00:32.088]  And he's put out a bunch of hoaxes before.
[03:00:32.768 --> 03:00:35.949]  And believe me, I don't want to get into a fight with this guy, but I have to for the Republic.
[03:00:35.949 --> 03:00:39.011]  Very dangerous crew around him.
[03:00:39.011 --> 03:00:41.732]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's a big history of white supremacists being fed.
[03:00:41.732 --> 03:00:45.033]  It's come out in the news, in Texas Monthly, in Reuters, everywhere.
[03:00:45.033 --> 03:00:51.116]  It's kept very quiet, but it's out there for you saying that all the banks are going to shut down next week.
[03:00:51.676 --> 03:00:53.277]  And this has gotten huge traction.
[03:00:53.277 --> 03:00:55.699]  They're talking about it on the street in Austin.
[03:00:55.699 --> 03:00:56.800]  We can combat this.
[03:00:56.800 --> 03:01:01.904]  Go get our article, Hoax, Bank, Closure Story, Pedals, Bailout Propaganda.
[03:01:01.904 --> 03:01:02.245]  Get it.
[03:01:02.245 --> 03:01:05.307]  Get it out to everybody you know and fight this lie.
[03:01:05.307 --> 03:01:07.229]  And again, it mirrors the White House.
[03:01:07.649 --> 03:01:10.933]  Saying, do everything we say, give us all the power or depression.
[03:01:10.933 --> 03:01:14.258]  They want to orchestrate it to bring in their solution.
[03:01:14.258 --> 03:01:18.744]  Help us get the story out that martial law was threatened on Congress.
[03:01:18.744 --> 03:01:21.467]  Now they've signed over martial law power financially.
[03:01:21.467 --> 03:01:24.010]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts said that an hour and a half ago here.
[03:01:24.671 --> 03:01:29.694]  I mean, we've got the key info up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:01:29.694 --> 03:01:32.235]  Help us counter the lies.
[03:01:32.235 --> 03:01:38.579]  Now is the key time in the battle, because the people are against what the criminal groups in the government are doing, these cartels.
[03:01:38.579 --> 03:01:40.940]  And so they're really ready to hear the truth right now.
[03:01:40.940 --> 03:01:42.561]  Congressman, how important is this?
[03:01:42.561 --> 03:01:46.103]  You have Brad Sherman on, and you have Ron Paul on later.
[03:01:46.103 --> 03:01:50.366]  I hope that you will ask them if they understand
[03:01:51.149 --> 03:02:03.267]  What Bush did on August 28th, when he extended the so-called State of National Emergency, and extended by implication, and I'm sure by law, H.S.P.D 20 and N.S.P.D 51.
[03:02:05.789 --> 03:02:31.830]  I don't believe, and I've discussed this with one of the national authorities on it, Peter Dale Scott, I don't believe that Congress is even aware of their statutory responsibilities under the National Emergencies Act to review any state of emergency declared by the President by statute has to be reviewed by the House and the Senate with resolutions passed to continue them every six months and in nearly
[03:02:32.390 --> 03:02:33.111]  What has it been?
[03:02:33.111 --> 03:02:36.553]  Seven years since 9-11.
[03:02:36.553 --> 03:02:49.423]  There has never, never once been a session of the House or the Senate in which the state of emergency has been even acknowledged to exist.
[03:02:49.423 --> 03:02:51.404]  And Congressman, what you're saying is key.
[03:02:51.404 --> 03:02:55.507]  We have been on the stove with the Marshall Law turned on simmer.
[03:02:55.507 --> 03:02:57.529]  They are now jacking it up to high.
[03:02:58.189 --> 03:02:59.810]  Well, that's exactly right.
[03:02:59.810 --> 03:03:03.392]  And they do have these measures in place.
[03:03:03.392 --> 03:03:22.462]  In fact, we know how bad they are by what we can see, but when Peter DeFazio and Benny Thompson and members of the House Homeland Security Committee tried to find out what was in the agenda under which we, the United States of America, are being ruled, they were told that they were not
[03:03:23.263 --> 03:03:26.788]  They were not going to be allowed to see this information.
[03:03:26.788 --> 03:03:28.210]  And then the chairman asked for it.
[03:03:28.210 --> 03:03:37.203]  So as a former congressman, what does that mean when the White House, the executive, tells the legislative, which is co-equal, that they're not allowed to be involved in that?
[03:03:37.203 --> 03:03:38.886]  That is dictatorship of the executive.
[03:03:39.608 --> 03:03:57.060]  Well, it absolutely is, and that's why I'm saying we are already under this so-called continuity of government, you know, this COG formulation, by virtue of the fact that the Congress has become basically vestigial.
[03:03:57.060 --> 03:04:01.203]  Basically, the Congress is no longer a co-equal branch of the government.
[03:04:01.203 --> 03:04:03.705]  Okay, we're going to end the main... This is a good demonstration of that.
[03:04:03.705 --> 03:04:09.229]  We've got to end the main interview with you, and the other congressman's coming up in about ten minutes, but for the
[03:04:09.389 --> 03:04:19.493]  The Internet listeners and the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, let's do three final minutes with you about solutions, and folks can later see that on PrisonPlanet.tv and when it's ripped all over the web.
[03:04:19.493 --> 03:04:28.036]  So we'll do three more minutes with our guest, the Honorable Congressman Dan Hamburg, and then we will get our next sitting congressman on for you as well.
[03:04:29.625 --> 03:04:30.625]  Okay, sir.
[03:04:30.625 --> 03:04:32.386]  Literally, you've got the floor for the next three minutes.
[03:04:32.386 --> 03:04:33.226]  I've got a multitask.
[03:04:33.226 --> 03:04:37.948]  I'm going to run out of here and go work on the Ron Paul deal with a call that just came in.
[03:04:37.948 --> 03:04:42.030]  So you've got three minutes, Congressman, to revise and extend your remarks.
[03:04:42.030 --> 03:04:43.070]  Okay.
[03:04:43.070 --> 03:04:51.874]  Well, I'm very glad to have a few minutes to talk to Alex's audience out there and to
[03:04:53.928 --> 03:05:04.677]  To let them know that there are many of us out there, and even some of us who have served in Congress, who realize that bailing out the rich
[03:05:06.751 --> 03:05:17.495]  That 700 billion dollar bailouts, which could end up being much more than that, are certainly not in the interest of the people of this country.
[03:05:17.495 --> 03:05:34.641]  And when you hear some of the figures that are being used by people like Congressman Dennis Kucinich, who says that the overall quantity of debt that the American people are going to be shouldering for generations to come is in the
[03:05:35.391 --> 03:05:37.634]  Many, many trillions of dollars.
[03:05:37.634 --> 03:05:44.664]  He actually used the figure a quarter of a quadrillion.
[03:05:44.664 --> 03:05:47.468]  I have never heard the term quadrillion.
[03:05:47.975 --> 03:05:48.255]  Yes.
[03:06:08.925 --> 03:06:26.217]  During those years that the country actually built up a budget surplus, when George Bush came into office, I predicted that he would crash the economy in a short period of time, and he has done that.
[03:06:26.217 --> 03:06:32.902]  And you can't look at what has happened over the last eight years and think that it was not willful.
[03:06:32.902 --> 03:06:34.003]  It was willful.
[03:06:34.003 --> 03:06:38.406]  They do have a very strange
[03:06:39.342 --> 03:06:47.766]  Uh, plan in place under which they will become more powerful and we will become less powerful.
[03:06:47.766 --> 03:06:53.569]  And our constitutional rights, uh, have been compromised again and again and again.
[03:06:53.569 --> 03:07:06.256]  Uh, our role as taxpayers has become compromised to where we are paying, we, the people are paying for the sins of the few and the greed and the corruption of the few.
[03:07:07.253 --> 03:07:09.555]  And we have to put a stop to it.
[03:07:09.555 --> 03:07:12.737]  You know, we simply have to say no.
[03:07:12.737 --> 03:07:25.464]  We may, in a short period of time, have to not only say no, but speak no in ways that we have never been called on to do before.
[03:07:25.464 --> 03:07:27.366]  Alright, the gentleman's time has expired.
[03:07:27.366 --> 03:07:28.947]  We're going to come back to the full audience.
[03:07:28.947 --> 03:07:31.548]  I want you to plug your great websites with a lot of information.
[03:07:31.548 --> 03:07:32.389]  We'll close this out.
[03:07:32.389 --> 03:07:32.709]  Here we go.
[03:07:34.073 --> 03:07:37.615]  ...enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:07:37.615 --> 03:07:41.516]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:07:41.516 --> 03:07:51.101]  Alright, Congressman, in closing, tell us about a couple of your websites, people can check out some of the articles you've written and the research you've done, documenting everything you've been saying.
[03:07:52.721 --> 03:07:59.543]  Myself and my co-author Louis Seiler, we have several articles that are up on our website.
[03:07:59.543 --> 03:08:03.625]  Many articles www.voiceoftheenvironment.org.
[03:08:03.625 --> 03:08:06.526]  Also www.voteaction.org.
[03:08:06.526 --> 03:08:07.986]  You can see the articles we've written.
[03:08:07.986 --> 03:08:13.288]  A recent article we wrote on state of emergency the last six months of the Bush administration.
[03:08:13.288 --> 03:08:18.230]  Many of the things that we were talking about in that article sadly now seem to be coming to pass.
[03:08:19.244 --> 03:08:19.825]  It's my pleasure, Alex.
[03:08:19.825 --> 03:08:20.005]  Good luck.
[03:08:37.796 --> 03:08:39.217]  Good night and good luck and God bless you.
[03:08:39.217 --> 03:08:40.178]  Take care.
[03:08:40.178 --> 03:08:47.985]  All right, in the five minutes or so, while we're waiting for the next congressman, sitting congressman, Brad Sherman, to call in, I want to play, and then later we'll play the rest of it.
[03:08:47.985 --> 03:09:01.796]  This is in, like, just a few minutes into Matrix of Evil, where I go before the city council with over a thousand others, but only about a hundred got to speak because of time constraints for four hours, and expose the Patriot Act and laid out what's now happening.
[03:09:01.796 --> 03:09:04.678]  We'll play as much of this as we can while we get the congressman on.
[03:09:04.678 --> 03:09:05.079]  Here it is.
[03:09:07.409 --> 03:09:08.390]  Okay.
[03:09:08.390 --> 03:09:10.771]  Okay, so Mr. Jones, you're now at your maximum of 15 minutes.
[03:09:10.771 --> 03:09:16.834]  I just will say, folks, occasionally you'll see myself or council members leaving the dais.
[03:09:16.834 --> 03:09:22.016]  I promise you when we're back in the back, there's a television and audio we can hear and see.
[03:09:22.016 --> 03:09:23.537]  Oh yes, I believe you.
[03:09:23.537 --> 03:09:26.498]  Don't be offended when I leave.
[03:09:26.498 --> 03:09:27.499]  I'm not offended.
[03:09:27.499 --> 03:09:28.099]  Welcome, Mr. Jones.
[03:09:28.099 --> 03:09:29.080]  You have 15 minutes.
[03:09:29.080 --> 03:09:29.680]  Well, thank you.
[03:09:30.476 --> 03:09:32.237]  And I hope you do stay, because this is important.
[03:09:32.237 --> 03:09:36.779]  And I want to thank the people that came here that are part of the second American revolution.
[03:09:36.779 --> 03:09:38.680]  We shall prevail.
[03:09:38.680 --> 03:09:44.102]  That is a guarantee.
[03:09:44.102 --> 03:09:48.964]  Because as the new world order turns up the heat, they're going to form more resistance.
[03:09:48.964 --> 03:09:53.586]  The tighter they squeeze, the more people are going to have that light bulb go off above their head.
[03:09:54.127 --> 03:10:01.734]  Now I believe this council is made up of good people and I think it's great that Jackie Goodman, Mayor of Proteum, has brought this forward.
[03:10:01.734 --> 03:10:04.016]  Let's go through the facts.
[03:10:04.016 --> 03:10:17.607]  And John Ashcroft and Lord Bush and their military industrial complex owners, who are setting up a military dictatorship, I mean this is admitted, BNAC documents, cannot hide the reality of what's happening.
[03:10:17.607 --> 03:10:20.850]  In fact, Ashcroft, six months ago, really committed a federal crime.
[03:10:21.684 --> 03:10:23.165]  He's sworn testimony before the House and Senate.
[03:10:23.165 --> 03:10:25.026]  He said there is no new terrorism legislation.
[03:10:25.026 --> 03:10:26.867]  It's not been introduced.
[03:10:26.867 --> 03:10:28.928]  The Domestic Security Enhancement Act.
[03:10:28.928 --> 03:10:30.609]  The Justice Domestic Security Enhancement Act.
[03:10:30.609 --> 03:10:32.050]  House and Senate versions.
[03:10:32.050 --> 03:10:34.391]  It's like if I got up here and said the sun didn't come up this morning.
[03:10:34.391 --> 03:10:35.231]  You'd laugh at me.
[03:10:35.231 --> 03:10:37.713]  But the press didn't call him on it.
[03:10:37.713 --> 03:10:42.695]  Now he's saying there is a Patriot Act II and Victory Act I and Victory Act II and you better pass all of them.
[03:10:42.695 --> 03:10:46.077]  You know what's in Patriot Act II, Section 501?
[03:10:46.077 --> 03:10:50.600]  You put the description of a terrorist under Section 802 of the first Patriot Act.
[03:10:50.600 --> 03:10:51.240]  You can be arrested.
[03:10:52.148 --> 03:10:54.109]  Secretly executed.
[03:10:54.109 --> 03:10:54.929]  That's right.
[03:10:54.929 --> 03:10:58.731]  A three military judge panel.
[03:10:58.731 --> 03:11:08.535]  Now what is section 802 of the first Patriot Act that passed on October 27, 2001 at five in the morning when no one was allowed to read it?
[03:11:08.535 --> 03:11:10.836]  According to members of Congress.
[03:11:10.836 --> 03:11:17.479]  The definition of terrorist is any action that endangers human life that is a violation of any federal or state law.
[03:11:17.479 --> 03:11:20.520]  They have many other definitions about anything that influences government.
[03:11:21.403 --> 03:11:22.544]  Go read it for yourself.
[03:11:22.544 --> 03:11:24.304]  They're counting on you not reading it.
[03:11:24.304 --> 03:11:26.666]  They're counting on you not finding it.
[03:11:26.666 --> 03:11:32.909]  Ron Paul and others have pointed out that Hitler and Stalin and people didn't have the nerve to put stuff like this down on paper.
[03:11:32.909 --> 03:11:34.609]  They just did it!
[03:11:34.609 --> 03:11:38.411]  That's what's so amazing about this.
[03:11:38.411 --> 03:11:39.672]  And to see the Assistant U.S.
[03:11:39.672 --> 03:11:46.375]  Attorney here peddling this is really sad, but I know it's under orders.
[03:11:46.375 --> 03:11:49.817]  Because two months ago it was reported that Ashcroft met out in Hollywood
[03:11:50.506 --> 03:11:55.130]  We're the heads, the big editors of all the newspapers, and the heads of law enforcement.
[03:11:55.130 --> 03:12:01.715]  And so we'd like you to go out and write editorials, editors, we'd like you as attorneys, as attorneys, write editorials, get on talk shows.
[03:12:01.715 --> 03:12:05.058]  Two months ago it was reported that Ashcroft met out in Hollywood.
[03:12:05.058 --> 03:12:09.681]  We're the heads, the big editors of all the newspapers, and the heads of law enforcement.
[03:12:09.681 --> 03:12:16.687]  And so we'd like you to go out and write editorials, editors, we'd like you as attorneys, as attorneys, write editorials, get on talk shows.
[03:12:16.687 --> 03:12:17.848]  Get out there and sell the
[03:12:18.661 --> 03:12:22.563]  This is the people, this is good, this is a wonderful thing.
[03:12:22.563 --> 03:12:29.787]  So I want the council, in case you don't know this, and the people here today to understand that it's a stage-managed event.
[03:12:29.787 --> 03:12:37.071]  I mean it really was hatched in a smoky room to to oppress you, to manipulate you, to con you.
[03:12:37.071 --> 03:12:44.555]  That makes me very angry and that's why it's so exciting that this council may simply just say we have a Bill of Rights and Constitution
[03:12:45.394 --> 03:12:49.016]  And we will not violate the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[03:12:49.016 --> 03:12:51.557]  And in this city, America is still America.
[03:12:51.557 --> 03:12:54.878]  I mean, it's just that simple.
[03:12:54.878 --> 03:12:57.839]  Now, I'm sure you heard about five years ago about the FBI Crime Lab.
[03:12:57.839 --> 03:13:01.481]  The head of it, Dr. Frederick Weihurst, who I've interviewed several times, said, I'm not doing this anymore.
[03:13:01.481 --> 03:13:03.761]  We've been framing people, manufacturing evidence.
[03:13:03.761 --> 03:13:06.503]  This is out of control.
[03:13:06.503 --> 03:13:10.904]  I've interviewed FBI agent Tyrone Powers, who talked about how they would frame people.
[03:13:10.904 --> 03:13:12.345]  The different criminal things they would do.
[03:13:13.689 --> 03:13:15.070]  Tulia, Texas.
[03:13:15.070 --> 03:13:16.130]  56 black people.
[03:13:16.130 --> 03:13:17.110]  No criminal record.
[03:13:17.110 --> 03:13:18.211]  No drug paraphernalia.
[03:13:18.211 --> 03:13:19.011]  No nothing.
[03:13:19.011 --> 03:13:25.594]  On the word of one corrupt cop, gave them all 20 to 90 years in prison.
[03:13:25.594 --> 03:13:26.534]  Now you think about that.
[03:13:26.534 --> 03:13:28.335]  Houston Crime Lab.
[03:13:28.335 --> 03:13:32.877]  Thousands framed indiscriminately.
[03:13:32.877 --> 03:13:36.058]  The police chief had to admit it because his job's on the line.
[03:13:36.058 --> 03:13:38.959]  He's claiming, oh, I'm going to fix that problem.
[03:13:38.959 --> 03:13:43.381]  It's equivalent of Harriman Goring, you know, promising to stop what Hitler was up to.
[03:13:44.440 --> 03:13:46.521]  This is amazing, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:13:46.521 --> 03:13:49.583]  So this is why we restrict the scope and size of government.
[03:13:49.583 --> 03:13:51.363]  And it's power over us and our lives.
[03:13:51.363 --> 03:13:53.004]  Because we know there's criminals on the street.
[03:13:53.004 --> 03:13:54.105]  We know there's bad people.
[03:13:54.105 --> 03:14:06.891]  But they don't have the massive mechanisms, the machinery of government, and military, and militarized police, and prison complexes to oppress at levels... Alex, are you there?
[03:14:09.292 --> 03:14:09.953]  Hello?
[03:14:09.953 --> 03:14:12.616]  Yeah, we're on air right now, streaming on the internet.
[03:14:12.616 --> 03:14:13.437]  Okay, I got your guess.
[03:14:13.437 --> 03:14:14.098]  Alright, here we go, thank you.
[03:14:14.098 --> 03:14:20.947]  So don't tell me we shouldn't have a concern with the most draconian legislation in the history of the world!
[03:14:20.947 --> 03:14:25.173]  Dwarfing Byzantine Spain and France is rolled out against the people!
[03:14:28.186 --> 03:14:30.068]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:14:30.068 --> 03:14:38.519]  That was going back, what, four years ago when we got Austin to throw out the Patriot Act and say the Bill of Rights and Constitution still existed.
[03:14:38.519 --> 03:14:41.042]  And before the show ends, I'm going to air the rest of my speech there.
[03:14:41.042 --> 03:14:43.124]  We'll back it up a little bit so you can hear it all.
[03:14:43.124 --> 03:14:45.027]  That's from the film Matrix of Evil.
[03:14:45.027 --> 03:14:46.428]  I am very honored to have
[03:14:47.990 --> 03:15:06.635]  Congressman Brad Sherman on the air with us, Harvard Law School, this is education, JD, Magna Cum Laude, UCLA, BA, he goes on, instructor, Harvard Law, School International Tax Program, his bio goes on and on, so he can certainly speak to the fact of martial law.
[03:15:06.635 --> 03:15:10.156]  We've talked to other congressmen here on air that have said yes, they've been threatened with the U.S.
[03:15:10.156 --> 03:15:14.917]  collapsing, martial law being installed, the Army has announced in the Army Times,
[03:15:16.337 --> 03:15:23.459]  That, oh, NORTHCOM's deploying a brigade, gonna bring others in for civil unrest, we'll use our microwave cannons on the people.
[03:15:23.459 --> 03:15:34.162]  I mean, this is all happening in the last week, and we saw the financial terrorism of the White House saying, pass this bill, give us immunity, give us all this power, or
[03:15:35.401 --> 03:15:39.924]  We're going to have a depression, and then it didn't pass Monday, so the market dropped $1 trillion, $200 billion.
[03:15:39.924 --> 03:15:42.606]  If that isn't economic terrorism, I don't know what is.
[03:15:42.606 --> 03:15:46.428]  So, we have the Congressman almost, we'll have him for five minutes, five, six minutes.
[03:15:46.428 --> 03:15:49.190]  Congressman Brad Sherman, thank you for coming on, sir.
[03:15:49.190 --> 03:15:50.031]  Good to be with you.
[03:15:50.031 --> 03:16:01.158]  You know, Wall Street used these panic tactics to get us to pass this $700 billion, well, what the bill really is is $700 billion in unmarked bills.
[03:16:03.075 --> 03:16:12.704]  They said the market would drop by 4,000 points, blood would flow in the streets, and lions would be devouring children in the parks of Los Angeles.
[03:16:12.704 --> 03:16:25.116]  Now that the bill has passed, our economy is still going to be very bad in the fall and winter, but the Wall Street folks will come out and say, well, it was a great bill, after all.
[03:16:25.826 --> 03:16:28.527]  There are no lions in the parks of Los Angeles.
[03:16:28.527 --> 03:16:48.176]  So, we've got to do everything we can to focus people's attention on this bill as it's carried out because it allows Paulson to go up to Wall Street, he can give money to one firm, he cannot return phone calls from another firm, he can take
[03:16:48.815 --> 03:16:57.900]  He can, if he wants, find out which firms are donating to the 527 organizations which take secret contributions and then make political advertising.
[03:16:57.900 --> 03:17:00.321]  He can look at the RNC donor list.
[03:17:00.321 --> 03:17:01.722]  He can do anything he wants.
[03:17:01.722 --> 03:17:15.190]  Congressman, I know that you're moving forward now, as a good congressman would, for your constituents now that the corruption has passed through economic terrorism, but let's go back to what you said on the floor in the last 24 hours about members of Congress, and I've talked to some.
[03:17:15.930 --> 03:17:17.371]  Well, I know that some comments like that were made.
[03:17:17.371 --> 03:17:18.532]  I didn't take them seriously.
[03:17:18.532 --> 03:17:19.233]  I know some would.
[03:17:42.624 --> 03:17:49.166]  I thought it was just an overblown effort to create a panic in order to pass a bad bill.
[03:17:49.166 --> 03:17:50.507]  Is that not terrorism?
[03:17:50.507 --> 03:17:56.349]  I mean, is that not the definition to threaten harm or carry out harm for a political aim, sir?
[03:17:56.349 --> 03:18:00.270]  Well, they didn't say they'd shoot anybody.
[03:18:00.270 --> 03:18:10.594]  So, usually terrorism involves threats of violence, and whether a drop in the Dow is violent or not, I mean, I'm sure
[03:18:11.400 --> 03:18:17.205]  That somebody had a heart attack when the market dropped a few hundred points.
[03:18:17.205 --> 03:18:21.088]  But keep in mind, we passed the bill and I'm told the market is down.
[03:18:21.088 --> 03:18:22.269]  Is it not?
[03:18:22.269 --> 03:18:23.630]  Well, sir, we have cyber-terrorism.
[03:18:23.630 --> 03:18:28.074]  They call hacking terrorism under the Patriot Act, Section 802.
[03:18:28.074 --> 03:18:32.157]  Any action, you know, they claim is even a misdemeanor as terrorism.
[03:18:32.157 --> 03:18:38.442]  I mean, to have a trillion, two hundred billion dollar loss in one day with them fear-mongering, I call that economic terrorism.
[03:18:38.442 --> 03:18:40.223]  Well, I don't think of it as that big a loss.
[03:18:41.224 --> 03:18:41.985]  I understand.
[03:18:58.286 --> 03:19:00.929]  I don't think we made a trillion or lost a trillion on anyone.
[03:19:16.565 --> 03:19:19.407]  Sir, here's the $64 million question.
[03:19:19.407 --> 03:19:25.473]  You and other members of Congress say, yeah, well, there were some people threatening martial law, but we don't, you know, think they meant it.
[03:19:25.473 --> 03:19:29.556]  They were just trying to fearmonger, which I call terrorism, into it.
[03:19:29.556 --> 03:19:31.337]  That's a huge issue.
[03:19:31.337 --> 03:19:33.419]  Specifically, sir, we need to know names.
[03:19:33.419 --> 03:19:39.024]  Who told you that they were told that martial law and blood in the streets, as you said, what happened?
[03:19:39.537 --> 03:19:45.961]  Private conversations between members on the floor, you really can't reveal without the permission of the other party.
[03:19:45.961 --> 03:19:49.063]  I understand, but were there armed twisters coming up or were they scared?
[03:19:49.063 --> 03:19:51.104]  I mean, how was it said specifically?
[03:19:51.104 --> 03:19:53.866]  I think these were people who really believed what they were saying.
[03:19:53.866 --> 03:20:00.870]  I don't think these were people who were, you know, got called by Goldman Sachs and said, well, go say this or go say that.
[03:20:00.870 --> 03:20:03.012]  The panic takes a...
[03:20:05.084 --> 03:20:06.104]  A life of its own.
[03:20:06.104 --> 03:20:08.425]  One person says the market will drop 2,000 points.
[03:20:08.425 --> 03:20:10.085]  Somebody else says 2,500.
[03:20:10.085 --> 03:20:11.686]  Somebody else says 3,000.
[03:20:11.686 --> 03:20:15.586]  Somebody else says unemployment will jump immediately to 9%.
[03:20:15.586 --> 03:20:17.227]  It spreads.
[03:20:17.227 --> 03:20:19.247]  It gets worse and worse.
[03:20:19.247 --> 03:20:28.969]  I don't think there was, or at least I'm not aware of this being carefully orchestrated.
[03:20:28.969 --> 03:20:33.190]  But I think now what we have to do is expose those circumstances.
[03:20:33.689 --> 03:20:43.881]  Where we're bailing out a particular firm and how many of the executives of that firm are continuing to make a million dollars a year, five million dollars a year, twenty million dollars a year.
[03:20:43.881 --> 03:20:47.565]  That's the message that needs to get out each and every time.
[03:20:49.950 --> 03:20:56.174]  By the way, Congressman, you are, for the listeners, uniquely positioned to be able to comment on all this.
[03:20:56.174 --> 03:21:06.862]  You work for some of the most important and prestigious firms doing audits of multinational corporations and of government entities, so you know what you're talking about.
[03:21:06.862 --> 03:21:12.025]  I know what I'm talking about, but there's going to be a lot of information that is not public.
[03:21:12.306 --> 03:21:19.209]  And it's going to take investigative reporters to find out things that congressmen can't find out and that the public is not going to be aware of.
[03:21:19.659 --> 03:21:23.522]  You know, I have to go right now, but it's been a pleasure being with you.
[03:21:23.522 --> 03:21:25.524]  Sir, let us get you back on for longer in the near future.
[03:21:25.524 --> 03:21:26.185]  Thank you, Congressman.
[03:21:26.185 --> 03:21:26.945]  I look forward to it.
[03:21:26.945 --> 03:21:28.206]  Thank you.
[03:21:28.206 --> 03:21:33.210]  We skipped that break because we got him on a few minutes late, and then he only had about five, six minutes.
[03:21:33.210 --> 03:21:35.432]  So there you heard it, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:21:35.432 --> 03:21:43.719]  Yeah, there were people on the floor saying they were told martial law and literal blood in the streets if this didn't happen, and they were told this, but I can't tell you who told me.
[03:21:44.680 --> 03:21:50.682]  Meanwhile, the Army is in the Army Times saying, oh, we're here for, you know, for civil emergency, martial law.
[03:21:50.682 --> 03:21:57.323]  The John Warner Defense Authorization Act says that the governors run nothing, Congress runs nothing, PDD 51.
[03:21:57.323 --> 03:21:59.604]  It's all there and this is being threatened.
[03:21:59.604 --> 03:22:05.386]  And now, according to Paul Craig Roberts, Dr. Roberts earlier, this gives economic martial law power to the Treasury.
[03:22:05.386 --> 03:22:08.386]  So, one way or the other, they got it.
[03:22:08.386 --> 03:22:09.647]  Now, I'm going to do this.
[03:22:09.647 --> 03:22:12.468]  I want to open the phones up.
[03:22:12.468 --> 03:22:13.708]  I want to open the phones up.
[03:22:14.940 --> 03:22:22.646]  For people out there listening at the bottom of the hour, specifically on what you think of the banker takeover and the Marshall Law and all of it.
[03:22:22.646 --> 03:22:27.430]  And we're busting our butts here to bring you these congressmen, these eyewitnesses, these reports.
[03:22:27.430 --> 03:22:30.713]  We really appreciate all of you tuning in today.
[03:22:30.713 --> 03:22:31.814]  Record audiences.
[03:22:31.814 --> 03:22:34.276]  The internet's a small part of our audience, hundreds of thousands.
[03:22:35.600 --> 03:22:41.904]  But still, it's a key gauge, and it's record streams listening on the InfoWars streams, record people tuned in just there.
[03:22:41.904 --> 03:22:46.526]  I know there's record numbers listening on the AM and FM dials, shortwave satellite right now.
[03:22:46.526 --> 03:22:47.407]  The internet's engaged.
[03:22:47.407 --> 03:22:48.747]  By the way, I misspoke earlier.
[03:22:48.747 --> 03:22:51.309]  I said 83,000 people a day download the podcast.
[03:22:51.309 --> 03:22:52.149]  It's now 98,000.
[03:22:52.149 --> 03:23:01.174]  In one week, it's grown to 98,000 a day downloading the free podcast at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:23:01.174 --> 03:23:02.635]  Now, we skipped this network break.
[03:23:02.635 --> 03:23:03.055]  Don't worry.
[03:23:03.055 --> 03:23:04.276]  Sponsors will get your ads played.
[03:23:05.056 --> 03:23:09.479]  Just on a later day for that break there.
[03:23:09.479 --> 03:23:13.041]  But in times like these, we've got to take every minute we've got.
[03:23:13.041 --> 03:23:15.302]  So I didn't just skip that on the internet streams.
[03:23:15.302 --> 03:23:18.203]  We skipped that network-wide.
[03:23:18.203 --> 03:23:19.664]  But I'm only going to give each caller about a minute.
[03:23:19.664 --> 03:23:22.185]  I'm really bad about taking long questions than I babble.
[03:23:22.185 --> 03:23:26.488]  I'm just going to let you have your say, kind of like radio graffiti as some call it.
[03:23:26.488 --> 03:23:27.929]  I'm not going to comment much.
[03:23:27.929 --> 03:23:29.489]  I'm just going to let you have your rant.
[03:23:29.489 --> 03:23:29.910]  Be ready.
[03:23:29.910 --> 03:23:29.970]  1-800-259-9231.
[03:23:32.731 --> 03:23:35.414]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[03:23:35.414 --> 03:23:42.903]  A lot of days, Ron Paul says, I can definitely come on at this time, and then he always comes on, or sometimes something comes up, and then he has to reschedule.
[03:23:42.903 --> 03:23:50.912]  He may be popping in still in the next 40 minutes, so that might mess up some of those that want to call in, but barring him calling in during the calls we'll be taking, we'll be going to those.
[03:23:52.085 --> 03:23:57.627]  I'm going to take a break right now for the next five minutes and finish up some of my speech before the City Council in Austin four years ago.
[03:23:57.627 --> 03:24:05.531]  Back that up about 20 seconds for listeners out there and we'll continue with how long ago we were warning everybody about the situation and we'll come back.
[03:24:05.531 --> 03:24:12.614]  We'll take the next break in about four minutes and then we'll come back and take your phone calls right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:24:12.614 --> 03:24:14.475]  Stay with us.
[03:24:14.475 --> 03:24:19.177]  That makes me very angry and that's why it's so exciting that this council may
[03:24:19.941 --> 03:24:28.985]  Simply just say we have a Bill of Rights and Constitution, and we will not violate the Bill of Rights and Constitution, and in this city, America is still America.
[03:24:28.985 --> 03:24:32.306]  I mean, it's just that simple.
[03:24:32.306 --> 03:24:35.268]  Now, I'm sure you heard about five years ago about the FBI Crime Lab.
[03:24:35.268 --> 03:24:38.909]  The head of it, Dr. Frederick Whitehurst, who I've interviewed several times, said, I'm not doing this anymore.
[03:24:38.909 --> 03:24:41.190]  We've been framing people, manufacturing evidence.
[03:24:41.190 --> 03:24:43.911]  This is out of control.
[03:24:43.911 --> 03:24:47.633]  I've interviewed FBI agent Tyrone Powers, who talked about how they would frame people.
[03:24:48.311 --> 03:24:51.113]  The different criminal things they would do.
[03:24:51.113 --> 03:24:52.494]  Tulia, Texas.
[03:24:52.494 --> 03:24:53.554]  56 black people.
[03:24:53.554 --> 03:24:54.535]  No criminal record.
[03:24:54.535 --> 03:24:55.636]  No drug paraphernalia.
[03:24:55.636 --> 03:24:56.416]  No nothing.
[03:24:56.416 --> 03:25:03.021]  On the word of one corrupt cop, gave them all 20 to 90 years in prison.
[03:25:03.021 --> 03:25:03.961]  Now you think about that.
[03:25:03.961 --> 03:25:05.743]  Houston Crime Lab.
[03:25:05.743 --> 03:25:10.306]  Thousands framed indiscriminately.
[03:25:10.306 --> 03:25:12.267]  The police chief had to admit it.
[03:25:12.267 --> 03:25:13.468]  Because his job's on the line.
[03:25:13.468 --> 03:25:15.489]  He's claiming, oh, I'm gonna fix that problem.
[03:25:16.397 --> 03:25:21.838]  It's equivalent of Herman Goering promising to stop what Hitler was up to.
[03:25:21.838 --> 03:25:23.939]  This is amazing, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:25:23.939 --> 03:25:28.780]  So this is why we restrict the scope and size of government and its power over us and our lives.
[03:25:28.780 --> 03:25:43.643]  Because we know there's criminals on the street, we know there's bad people, but they don't have the massive mechanisms, the machinery of government and military and militarized police and prison complexes to oppress at levels never before seen.
[03:25:43.643 --> 03:25:45.864]  Last century, 200 million killed by government.
[03:25:47.270 --> 03:25:48.191]  200 million killed.
[03:25:48.191 --> 03:25:51.432]  Millions of American Indians, Native Americans, killed in this country.
[03:25:51.432 --> 03:26:02.576]  So don't tell me we shouldn't have a concern when the most draconian legislation in the history of the world, dwarfing Byzantine Spain and France, is rolled out against the people.
[03:26:11.430 --> 03:26:20.017]  Now, I could list the crimes of the FBI, the Defense Department, state police, local police, all day long.
[03:26:20.017 --> 03:26:28.544]  My point is, history shows us that we must watch and we must control and we must limit powerful men.
[03:26:28.544 --> 03:26:32.847]  Because power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[03:26:32.847 --> 03:26:36.450]  And I challenge members of this distinguished body
[03:26:37.071 --> 03:26:38.111]  To be part of history.
[03:26:38.111 --> 03:26:39.492]  To not abstain.
[03:26:39.492 --> 03:26:42.072]  To get out on the field in your life.
[03:26:42.072 --> 03:26:44.633]  And you'll truly be alive.
[03:26:44.633 --> 03:26:48.533]  To not sell out to this corrupt system.
[03:26:48.533 --> 03:26:51.314]  You know, I spoke right before Ron Paul just a few weeks ago, right outside Austin.
[03:26:51.314 --> 03:26:54.655]  He talked about how his poll numbers just go up and up and up.
[03:26:54.655 --> 03:26:57.875]  And the support just gets greater and greater and greater as he resists all of this.
[03:26:57.875 --> 03:26:58.855]  And as he says no to this.
[03:26:58.855 --> 03:27:01.236]  And as he throws the lobbyist out of his office.
[03:27:01.236 --> 03:27:06.657]  The truth is, when the whole world's sold out, you guys are going to get more power out of not going with the system.
[03:27:07.415 --> 03:27:11.078]  This thing is in terminal velocity!
[03:27:11.078 --> 03:27:13.440]  This thing is falling down around itself.
[03:27:13.440 --> 03:27:18.264]  The corruption, the comprehensive annual financial reports, the scams.
[03:27:18.264 --> 03:27:20.486]  Now, I've got about nine minutes left.
[03:27:20.486 --> 03:27:25.851]  I'm going to try to go through these points because they're all very, very important.
[03:27:25.851 --> 03:27:33.377]  Section 213 of the First Patriot Act lets them break in your house or any business and take whatever they want or plant whatever they want and not tell you for six months they were there.
[03:27:33.377 --> 03:27:34.578]  And they're administrative.
[03:27:34.578 --> 03:27:35.459]  They're rubber stamps.
[03:27:36.522 --> 03:27:42.115]  They aren't for Billy Bob's house because we think he has this under the Fourth Amendment.
[03:27:42.115 --> 03:27:43.077]  They're for everybody.
[03:27:43.077 --> 03:27:44.521]  They're for whole classes of people.
[03:27:45.402 --> 03:27:51.327]  And now under the new Patriot Act, they have sections where they say, our officers need not even need these administrative subpoenas or warrants.
[03:27:51.327 --> 03:27:55.851]  They can just carte blanche go anywhere they want for any crime or suspected crime.
[03:27:55.851 --> 03:28:10.383]  And the spokesman for the Justice Department just a few months ago, after Ashcroft admitted, OK, there is a Patriot Act too, went before the House and Senate, and this was in the news, in the Associated Press, and said, well, yeah, we're going to use this in all crimes, all drug crimes, everything.
[03:28:10.383 --> 03:28:13.265]  Misdemeanors, third degree felonies, everything.
[03:28:13.265 --> 03:28:14.046]  That's on the record.
[03:28:15.416 --> 03:28:15.576]  U.S.
[03:28:15.576 --> 03:28:20.419]  attorneys, deputy attorneys, system attorneys, all these people, they're saying, yeah, we're going to use this for everything.
[03:28:20.419 --> 03:28:21.760]  They are using it for everything.
[03:28:21.760 --> 03:28:36.788]  The Victory Act, which is a continual salvo in this attack on the American people, clearly states that any possession of a controlled substance is an act of terrorism under Section 802, pointing back to that enacting clause.
[03:28:37.662 --> 03:28:38.683]  Well, it endangers human life.
[03:28:38.683 --> 03:28:40.184]  It's a weapon of mass destruction.
[03:28:40.184 --> 03:28:46.829]  They've actually got articles in the news about, oh yeah, they're charging people with weapons of mass destruction because they had marijuana.
[03:28:46.829 --> 03:28:48.030]  We don't want to be part of this!
[03:28:48.030 --> 03:28:49.612]  This is crazy!
[03:28:49.612 --> 03:28:51.313]  People disappearing in the middle of the night?
[03:28:51.313 --> 03:28:54.856]  I mean, what did Alexander Shultz and Nietzsche say in Gulag Archipelago?
[03:28:54.856 --> 03:29:02.602]  Oh, how we burned in the camps later, wishing that when the secret police went out at night to come to our doors, we would have met them.
[03:29:02.602 --> 03:29:06.125]  Met them downstairs with pokers and axes and daggers.
[03:29:19.938 --> 03:29:23.859]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:23.859 --> 03:29:29.821]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:29.821 --> 03:29:36.582]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:29:36.582 --> 03:29:38.243]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:29:39.218 --> 03:29:40.759]  But who is the enemy?
[03:29:40.759 --> 03:29:41.580]  Bin Laden.
[03:29:41.580 --> 03:29:42.600]  This is his ammo.
[03:29:42.600 --> 03:29:43.901]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:29:43.901 --> 03:29:45.922]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:29:45.922 --> 03:29:53.067]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:29:53.067 --> 03:29:53.547]  Some U.S.
[03:29:53.547 --> 03:29:59.191]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:29:59.891 --> 03:30:03.412]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:30:03.412 --> 03:30:06.192]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[03:30:29.554 --> 03:30:32.979]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[03:30:32.979 --> 03:30:35.302]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[03:30:35.302 --> 03:30:38.606]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[03:30:38.606 --> 03:30:45.495]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[03:30:45.495 --> 03:30:47.598]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[03:30:48.078 --> 03:30:51.381]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[03:30:51.381 --> 03:30:56.165]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[03:30:56.165 --> 03:31:00.108]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[03:31:00.108 --> 03:31:01.729]  Travel less, meet online.

[03:31:33.627 --> 03:31:43.411]  Did you know that the Rhodes Scholar was founded by Cecil Rhodes of England for the purpose of educating bright young men to learn to rule the world?
[03:31:43.411 --> 03:31:51.014]  He said in 1890 that within a hundred or so years there would be enough trained men that world government could be achieved.
[03:31:51.014 --> 03:31:55.475]  President Bill Clinton and several in his administration were Rhodes Scholars.
[03:31:55.475 --> 03:31:57.616]  Was Cecil Rhodes right?
[03:31:57.616 --> 03:31:59.437]  Are we approaching this world government?

[03:33:07.927 --> 03:33:09.748]  Who is that horseman?
[03:33:09.748 --> 03:33:10.328]  I think I know him.
[03:33:10.328 --> 03:33:11.208]  Minnie a young maid.
[03:33:11.208 --> 03:33:12.288]  Minnie a soldier.
[03:33:33.019 --> 03:33:34.959]  You are living history.
[03:33:34.959 --> 03:33:42.443]  Things are negative, but at the very same time, they're very positive.
[03:33:42.443 --> 03:33:47.225]  The New World Order is being revealed.
[03:33:47.225 --> 03:33:59.530]  And the millions of freedom lovers who exposed the New World Order to so many, their credibility is rising right now.
[03:34:10.499 --> 03:34:11.120]  We were there.
[03:34:11.120 --> 03:34:14.883]  They were in prison.
[03:34:14.883 --> 03:34:18.226]  Attacked.
[03:34:18.226 --> 03:34:19.728]  Audited.
[03:34:19.728 --> 03:34:20.789]  Killed.
[03:34:20.789 --> 03:34:21.830]  Persecuted.
[03:34:21.830 --> 03:34:22.330]  Shot at.
[03:34:22.330 --> 03:34:24.672]  To bring you the information you ought
[03:34:32.737 --> 03:34:37.682]  Stand up and be counted for what you are about to receive.
[03:34:37.682 --> 03:34:39.904]  The truth.
[03:34:39.904 --> 03:34:41.766]  Veritas.
[03:34:41.766 --> 03:34:49.213]  That which unlocks the very soul.
[03:34:49.213 --> 03:34:52.456]  We stood in history against the evil.
[03:34:52.456 --> 03:34:54.699]  We told the truth.
[03:34:54.699 --> 03:34:55.579]  We didn't falter.
[03:35:05.942 --> 03:35:14.132]  As the old Norse saying goes, cattle die and kinsmen die.
[03:35:14.132 --> 03:35:17.155]  For that I know it sure.
[03:35:17.155 --> 03:35:19.418]  One thing that never dies.
[03:35:33.595 --> 03:35:33.996]  We're good.
[03:35:54.099 --> 03:35:58.323]  Alright, I'm going to go to Joel, George, Fred, Robert, Travis, and a few others if we have time.
[03:35:58.323 --> 03:36:00.144]  I want to recap the top stories today.
[03:36:00.144 --> 03:36:04.988]  Incredible developments that we have witnessed at the end on the economy.
[03:36:04.988 --> 03:36:09.091]  Before I do that, this show is made possible.
[03:36:09.091 --> 03:36:13.615]  And we're no longer live on PrisonPlanet.tv, right?
[03:36:13.615 --> 03:36:14.215]  Good.
[03:36:14.215 --> 03:36:19.860]  That was a pretty good rant I just did then for the camera.
[03:36:19.860 --> 03:36:21.541]  Love fighting the new world order, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:36:22.549 --> 03:36:29.552]  Before I go any further, I want to tell you about the great folks at Acola Bloom.
[03:36:29.552 --> 03:36:31.352]  It's an atmospheric water generator for the home.
[03:36:31.352 --> 03:36:33.653]  Pays for itself in one year if you buy your water from the store.
[03:36:33.653 --> 03:36:36.994]  Pure clean water without the fluoride and limited water from the humidity in the air.
[03:36:36.994 --> 03:36:40.936]  Machine produces up to 28 liters in 24 hours, 7.5 gallons.
[03:36:40.936 --> 03:36:41.876]  Low operating costs.
[03:36:41.876 --> 03:36:44.297]  On average it costs about 12 cents a gallon and then it's paid off.
[03:36:44.944 --> 03:36:47.166]  But in the first year, 12 cents a gallon and it's paid off.
[03:36:47.166 --> 03:36:49.408]  Great tasting, pure H2O exactly the way nature makes it.
[03:36:49.408 --> 03:36:51.089]  No chemicals, pollutants, or toxins.
[03:36:51.089 --> 03:36:52.370]  Neutral pH.
[03:36:52.370 --> 03:36:57.734]  How it works, the water passes through an active carbon filter, and it's gathered from the atmosphere, the air.
[03:36:57.734 --> 03:37:06.441]  Then a silver impregnated carbon filter, then a reverse osmosis system, then a taste and odor removal filter that is stored in the tank, illuminated by antibacterial fungal UV light.
[03:37:08.010 --> 03:37:11.512]  Also, the machine comes in the colors red, black, white, green, silver, and blue.

[03:37:15.135 --> 03:37:16.876]  Another fine sponsor is New Vitality.
[03:37:30.996 --> 03:37:44.292]  And they have hundreds of just mainline, high-quality, documented, high-quality source, vitamins, minerals, things that are well-known to have nutritive and health effects, like aloe, body cleanse, flushes out the guts, great.
[03:37:44.292 --> 03:37:45.413]  It's got 30 ingredients.
[03:37:45.413 --> 03:37:47.576]  The main ingredient, concentrated aloe vera.
[03:37:48.422 --> 03:37:49.082]  800-569-4056, 800-569-4056.
[03:37:49.082 --> 03:38:01.990]  One of their other best-selling products, a super-beta prostate that even medical studies and mainline medical doctors say, you know, takes salt palmetto, but it's got a bunch of other ingredients as well.
[03:38:01.990 --> 03:38:06.033]  Average 40-45, you really should be taking something for the health of your prostate.
[03:38:06.033 --> 03:38:06.573]  800-569-4056, 800-569-4056.
[03:38:06.573 --> 03:38:08.474]  Our new vitality.com, big banner up on InfoWars.com.
[03:38:08.474 --> 03:38:09.835]  All right, quickly on to your calls.
[03:38:09.835 --> 03:38:11.476]  Joel in Texas, you're on the air.
[03:38:20.481 --> 03:38:20.742]  Hello!
[03:38:32.626 --> 03:38:34.407]  Kay Bailey Hutchinson is running for Governor.
[03:38:34.407 --> 03:38:36.889]  You've got to be Texas Governor, man.
[03:38:36.889 --> 03:38:39.811]  You've got to step up and get into some position of power.
[03:38:39.811 --> 03:38:42.353]  I know you have a huge forum.
[03:38:42.353 --> 03:38:43.614]  No, look, look, look.
[03:38:43.614 --> 03:38:47.436]  Number one, I don't overestimate my reach.
[03:38:47.436 --> 03:38:52.860]  My reach is great, virally, through the mass of people, through you taking action.
[03:38:53.756 --> 03:38:56.377]  The election laws are so corrupt, there's no way to run legally.
[03:38:56.377 --> 03:38:59.339]  They will selectively enforce and put you in jail or fine you.
[03:38:59.339 --> 03:39:03.740]  Also, there's no voting in many areas of Texas now with electronic fraud systems.
[03:39:03.740 --> 03:39:05.481]  And we're way past a lot of that.
[03:39:05.481 --> 03:39:07.022]  People should still vote, still be involved.
[03:39:07.022 --> 03:39:11.284]  But for me, my work is in filmmaking and radio and things.
[03:39:11.284 --> 03:39:11.724]  I gotcha.
[03:39:11.724 --> 03:39:13.685]  What about satellite radio?
[03:39:13.685 --> 03:39:18.967]  Well, satellite radio is owned by a conglomerate and we've tried to get on and they won't do it.
[03:39:19.708 --> 03:39:22.589]  Plus, it's a mouse that roars.
[03:39:22.589 --> 03:39:27.590]  There's only like 8 million people with both merged systems with 500 and something channels.
[03:39:27.590 --> 03:39:28.590]  I mean, they admit they're big.
[03:39:28.590 --> 03:39:31.371]  Out of people who've gotten on there, no response.
[03:39:31.371 --> 03:39:35.632]  I mean, 1,000 watt AM gets a bigger response than your average serious channel.
[03:39:35.632 --> 03:39:37.692]  I mean, it's incredible.
[03:39:37.692 --> 03:39:38.813]  Think about it.
[03:39:38.813 --> 03:39:40.693]  You've got more than 1,000 channels now, right?
[03:39:40.693 --> 03:39:42.453]  But like 500 main ones.
[03:39:42.453 --> 03:39:47.095]  And then you've got 8 million subscribers divided into that.
[03:39:47.095 --> 03:39:48.075]  What's 8 million divided by 500?
[03:39:50.678 --> 03:39:56.821]  And then you think about the fact that the average Sirius or XM listener that's now merged may listen maybe an hour or two a day.
[03:39:56.821 --> 03:40:03.004]  So you got maybe a million listening at any one time?
[03:40:03.004 --> 03:40:12.449]  Because one of the problems I'm running into is, just in kind of trying to spread the truth and stuff, is that the information's out there and people
[03:40:13.733 --> 03:40:17.135]  Uh, they just aren't willing, or just, they don't want to believe it.
[03:40:17.135 --> 03:40:20.016]  Well, Joel, they've got to see it over and over again, and I appreciate your call.
[03:40:20.016 --> 03:40:30.141]  I told you folks we're going to be talking about the bailout that passed a few hours ago, and your response, your take to it, and talk of the Congress people being told, literal martial law, they didn't pass it, blood in the streets.
[03:40:30.141 --> 03:40:34.683]  You heard it from the Congressman earlier, wouldn't tell us who was saying it on the floor, but said it was quite a few people.
[03:40:34.683 --> 03:40:36.904]  Okay, and I'm mad at you, Joel, but we're on topic here.
[03:40:36.904 --> 03:40:38.825]  Georgia and Texas, you're on the air.
[03:40:38.825 --> 03:40:40.426]  Yeah, formerly Georgia, Florida.
[03:40:41.189 --> 03:40:42.152]  I moved to Texas.
[03:40:42.152 --> 03:40:42.813]  Okay, whatever.
[03:40:42.813 --> 03:40:43.876]  Go ahead.
[03:40:43.876 --> 03:40:49.951]  Uh, yes, um, I remember my dad tell me, um, on his deathbed, he was retired commander of the Marine Corps and, uh,
[03:40:50.640 --> 03:41:04.448]  He was in a command meeting in Camp Lejeune and a member from the Armed Services Committee told him, this is back when Nixon, and told him don't follow the orders of the President because I think George W. Bush's Nixon administration on steroids.
[03:41:04.448 --> 03:41:17.776]  Well that's right, it came out in the mainstream news that the Congress and the military, they had meetings and they said the Congress is elected, the President's been proven to be a crook, he may try to launch a war, the military found out he wanted to bomb his own convention.
[03:41:17.776 --> 03:41:20.178]  This is now on PBS, this is Declassified, the tapes.
[03:41:20.598 --> 03:41:27.780]  Bomb his own convention and declare martial law, so the military told all their commanders and all the branches, do not do it.
[03:41:27.780 --> 03:41:32.481]  Today though, they love, you know, the black uniforms a little too much.
[03:41:32.481 --> 03:41:37.682]  Now most of them don't like it, but we're not as moral as we were in the 70s.
[03:41:37.682 --> 03:41:44.304]  Yes, it's just, like I say, it's like Nixon on steroids, and you know, they've got a dumbed down military now.
[03:41:44.304 --> 03:41:44.804]  I hear you.
[03:41:44.804 --> 03:41:46.285]  I'm glad you're bringing up the martial law angle.
[03:41:46.285 --> 03:41:47.565]  Your take on the bailout?
[03:41:48.763 --> 03:41:53.187]  I just think it's a big shift of wealth from the have-nots to the haves.
[03:41:53.187 --> 03:41:54.108]  No, that's it.
[03:41:54.108 --> 03:41:57.330]  Protecting them and fully imploding our economy.
[03:41:57.330 --> 03:42:00.073]  Dr. Paul Gert Roberts said earlier, and he should run the Treasury Department, folks.
[03:42:00.073 --> 03:42:01.934]  Wall Street Journal editor, too.
[03:42:01.934 --> 03:42:03.256]  Fred and Philly, you're on the air.
[03:42:03.256 --> 03:42:05.798]  I can't believe the guests we get for this show.
[03:42:05.798 --> 03:42:07.860]  It's a good radio show, man.
[03:42:07.860 --> 03:42:09.461]  Fred and Philly, go ahead.
[03:42:11.161 --> 03:42:21.165]  Could you explain to me the net worth of AIG and basically my theory might be that AIG was so heavily involved with paying off
[03:42:22.100 --> 03:42:33.088]  Or paying, under certain circumstances, defaulted securities that a lot of these folks already got paid the first time.
[03:42:33.088 --> 03:42:34.249]  No, that happened.
[03:42:34.249 --> 03:42:37.051]  That's why they get to keep it all secret, non-reviewable.
[03:42:37.051 --> 03:42:37.771]  I hear you.
[03:42:37.771 --> 03:42:41.754]  And they're allowed to pay whatever they want, even over market value, to themselves.
[03:42:41.754 --> 03:42:45.997]  It is $700-plus billion paid directly to the bankers that engineered it all.
[03:42:45.997 --> 03:42:47.238]  A huge bank robbery.
[03:42:47.238 --> 03:42:50.120]  No, but I mean, didn't the Treasury also
[03:42:51.361 --> 03:42:56.804]  Bail out AIG with a down payment of $200 billion, something like that?
[03:42:56.804 --> 03:42:57.305]  Yes.
[03:42:57.305 --> 03:43:00.587]  And they're going to continue those payments, right?
[03:43:00.587 --> 03:43:01.047]  That's it.
[03:43:01.047 --> 03:43:03.449]  It's all about bringing the currency down.
[03:43:03.449 --> 03:43:04.790]  They're bringing the country down.
[03:43:04.790 --> 03:43:07.252]  They're just whoring it out.
[03:43:07.252 --> 03:43:08.653]  Again, a picture of the U.S.
[03:43:08.653 --> 03:43:14.757]  is a big mansion full of beautiful paintings and furniture and marble and gold inlaid chandeliers.
[03:43:15.894 --> 03:43:31.065]  They've stolen the plasma TVs, the jewels, the furniture, and then they ripped out the wallpaper, and they ripped out the sinks, the marble sinks, and now they're tearing out the rafters and pulling down the pillars, and now they're grinding up the cement foundation to put it in.
[03:43:31.065 --> 03:43:33.566]  I mean, they are just stealing it all, sir.
[03:43:33.566 --> 03:43:36.248]  If you don't like it, a SWAT team will drop by and blow your head off.
[03:43:36.248 --> 03:43:37.449]  Alright, I appreciate your call.
[03:43:37.449 --> 03:43:39.350]  And I mean, that's what it comes down to.
[03:43:39.350 --> 03:43:43.533]  Just like the sheriff in Broward County, or what's the name of the county that
[03:43:45.775 --> 03:43:49.018]  You ever find that clip, John, from three years ago I wanted to play?
[03:43:49.018 --> 03:43:52.721]  Uh, it's, uh, yeah, Rashard.
[03:43:52.721 --> 03:43:53.742]  You'll find it again.
[03:43:53.742 --> 03:44:07.755]  His mother's dying for five days in the nursing home, and he's told, you can go get your mother, his mother, I was wondering, his mother out of the facility, and all these other cops stood down and followed fed orders, and his mommy died four days later.
[03:44:10.029 --> 03:44:13.155]  So these aren't even bad cops, they're just, like, pathetic.
[03:44:13.155 --> 03:44:14.939]  They'll follow any order.
[03:44:14.939 --> 03:44:21.853]  And that was all a big psychological warfare test, a, uh, what they call a, um, laboratory test.
[03:44:23.214 --> 03:44:23.915]  Here it is.
[03:44:23.915 --> 03:44:31.482]  And so understand, while you're going bankrupt, while you're losing everything, they'll still SWAT team attack, mow the people down, because it feels so good to have a black uniform.
[03:44:31.482 --> 03:44:37.648]  Meanwhile, their mommy, their wife, their cousins are going to be going bankrupt and homeless, too, in another part of the country, even in the same town.
[03:44:37.648 --> 03:44:38.529]  It doesn't matter, though.
[03:44:38.529 --> 03:44:42.012]  There at the barracks, at the police barracks, there's going to be federal slop.
[03:44:42.012 --> 03:44:45.556]  And that's all that matters is that devil tattoo and feeling tough.
[03:44:46.136 --> 03:44:48.978]  Well, don't worry, then you're going to get everything you want.
[03:44:48.978 --> 03:44:50.839]  Go ahead and play it.
[03:44:50.839 --> 03:44:57.564]  National Guard and local parish workers and levy board people, it took us two and a half days working 24-7.
[03:44:57.564 --> 03:44:59.145]  I just closed it.
[03:44:59.145 --> 03:45:03.688]  I'm telling you, most importantly, I want to thank my public employees that have worked 24-7.
[03:45:03.688 --> 03:45:05.149]  They've burned out.
[03:45:05.149 --> 03:45:06.649]  The doctors, the nurses.
[03:45:06.649 --> 03:45:10.272]  And I want to give you one last story, and I'll shut up and let you tell me whatever you want to tell me.
[03:45:10.912 --> 03:45:16.374]  The guy who runs this building I'm in, the emergency management, he's responsible for everything.
[03:45:16.374 --> 03:45:18.475]  His mother was trapped in St.
[03:45:18.475 --> 03:45:24.137]  Bernard Nursing Home and every day she called him and said, are you coming son?
[03:45:24.137 --> 03:45:25.637]  Is somebody coming?
[03:45:25.637 --> 03:45:29.259]  And he said, yeah mama, somebody's coming to get you.
[03:45:29.259 --> 03:45:31.719]  Somebody's coming to get you on Tuesday.
[03:45:31.719 --> 03:45:34.120]  Somebody's coming to get you on Wednesday.
[03:45:34.120 --> 03:45:36.001]  Somebody's coming to get you on Thursday.
[03:45:36.581 --> 03:45:38.982]  Somebody's coming to get you on Friday!
[03:45:38.982 --> 03:45:41.884]  And she drowned it Friday night!
[03:45:41.884 --> 03:45:44.645]  She drowned it Friday night!
[03:45:44.645 --> 03:45:48.307]  Mr. President... Nobody's coming to get us!
[03:45:48.307 --> 03:45:50.388]  Nobody's coming to get us!
[03:45:50.388 --> 03:45:52.109]  The Secretary has promised!
[03:45:52.109 --> 03:45:53.550]  Everybody's promised!
[03:45:53.550 --> 03:45:56.151]  Alright, and then we fleshed it out and interviewed them.
[03:45:56.151 --> 03:45:58.993]  The Feds wouldn't let the National Guard even in and they wanted to break down.
[03:45:58.993 --> 03:46:00.153]  They wouldn't let Walmart in.
[03:46:00.153 --> 03:46:03.175]  They wouldn't let the National, uh, the Coast Guard in.
[03:46:03.175 --> 03:46:05.056]  There's good people in the police and military.
[03:46:06.351 --> 03:46:10.832]  But let me tell you, letting your mama die as the head of emergency management isn't good.
[03:46:10.832 --> 03:46:11.993]  That's evil.
[03:46:11.993 --> 03:46:15.073]  Now you're gonna have some decisions to be making here.
[03:46:15.073 --> 03:46:19.135]  Robert in California, you're on the air.
[03:46:19.135 --> 03:46:30.978]  Um, this shows again that we shouldn't take down the names of everybody who voted yes on this thing, and really look into their financial statements and see who bought and paid for them.
[03:46:32.266 --> 03:46:39.529]  The other thing is, Joel was a little bit right, that it's not necessarily that you should run for office, it's that we all should run for office.
[03:46:39.529 --> 03:46:47.353]  Or at least those people who are good in our neighborhoods that are running for office, that we should get out there and support them.
[03:46:47.353 --> 03:46:49.374]  I agree we should run to expose the election fraud.
[03:46:49.374 --> 03:46:57.457]  See, the globalists preemptively took over most of the voting systems, now about 40% of them are swinging any major national move, so that they block us there.
[03:46:57.457 --> 03:46:59.538]  We have to have signed petitions
[03:47:00.385 --> 03:47:05.889]  To remove nationwide, you have to have a paper ballot removal of the electronic machines.
[03:47:05.889 --> 03:47:16.735]  Yeah, I understand that but also there's smaller elections where we have the base of power in a lot of areas that don't take money and they're not really rigged because they can't rig all of them.
[03:47:16.735 --> 03:47:17.676]  I hear you and I agree with you.
[03:47:17.676 --> 03:47:19.257]  We need to swarm them.
[03:47:19.257 --> 03:47:20.718]  Yes, absolutely.
[03:47:20.718 --> 03:47:22.339]  Good job, Commander.
[03:47:22.339 --> 03:47:24.020]  Let's talk to Travis in Seattle.
[03:47:24.020 --> 03:47:26.602]  You're on the air worldwide.
[03:47:26.602 --> 03:47:27.622]  Alex?
[03:47:27.622 --> 03:47:28.123]  Hello?
[03:47:28.123 --> 03:47:28.543]  Yes, sir!
[03:47:29.438 --> 03:47:33.162]  I would like to explain the parable of the fig tree real quick.
[03:47:33.162 --> 03:47:37.607]  When you go buy stock in a company, or shares, you own part of that company.
[03:47:37.607 --> 03:47:40.711]  You are then responsible for what that company does.
[03:47:40.711 --> 03:47:46.858]  Now, if it's an incorporation, a global outfit, what are the seeds of your fruit of your labor producing?
[03:47:46.858 --> 03:47:48.159]  That's all I gotta say, Alex.
[03:47:48.159 --> 03:47:49.541]  Misery, death, and destruction.
[03:47:51.829 --> 03:47:53.410]  Yeah, a lot of people think evil is cool.
[03:47:53.410 --> 03:47:54.730]  They think corruption is cool.
[03:47:54.730 --> 03:47:56.411]  They think it's all funny.
[03:47:56.411 --> 03:47:58.091]  You're gonna find out how funny it is.
[03:47:58.091 --> 03:48:04.854]  People have been upright throughout history after collapses because they realize how dangerous evil is.
[03:48:04.854 --> 03:48:15.097]  But see, we were taught that it was cute and funny and corruption was cute and funny and we became corrupt and now we're gonna get gang-raped.
[03:48:15.097 --> 03:48:17.578]  Let me tell you something, evil is very, very, very bad.
[03:48:17.578 --> 03:48:19.959]  It's not a game.
[03:48:21.448 --> 03:48:22.210]  It's not a joke.
[03:48:22.210 --> 03:48:24.314]  Good people gotta stand up now and let their light shine.
[03:48:24.314 --> 03:48:29.765]  Alright, I'm gonna bring Ted Anderson up to the balance.
[03:48:31.334 --> 03:48:32.034]  of the broadcast.
[03:48:32.034 --> 03:48:33.775]  I'll be live this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:48:33.775 --> 03:48:36.357]  Huge transmission coming up when this show ends.
[03:48:36.357 --> 03:48:41.619]  Only on the internet with the 93,000 people downloading the podcast one hour after it ends.
[03:48:41.619 --> 03:48:44.821]  The hundreds of thousands that tune in to the restreams.
[03:48:44.821 --> 03:48:48.163]  You'll be able to hear all the congressmen and material and information we had on earlier.
[03:48:48.163 --> 03:48:49.744]  It was unbelievably powerful.
[03:48:49.744 --> 03:48:51.445]  The information is key.
[03:48:51.445 --> 03:48:52.785]  You have to get that information.
[03:48:52.785 --> 03:48:54.226]  Write your own stories, your own facts.
[03:48:54.226 --> 03:48:57.208]  We break it all down and get it out to everybody.
[03:48:57.208 --> 03:48:57.868]  Ted Anderson,
[03:48:59.108 --> 03:49:06.655]  I told you that I wanted some buffaloes, a couple buffaloes, which the Mint can't get gold at the price it wants, so it's basically stopped making coins.
[03:49:06.655 --> 03:49:09.978]  A bunch of other coins are running out or can't be gotten.
[03:49:09.978 --> 03:49:13.841]  The British Sovereigns, the Franks, you've got some
[03:49:15.114 --> 03:49:17.095]  Some half-dollars, U.S.
[03:49:17.095 --> 03:49:23.137]  half-ouncers, one of those Franklins, that are going at a premium, but you got them close to melt.
[03:49:23.137 --> 03:49:31.540]  Incredible deals, and I know that you sold out, you ran out of the Buffalos, but you've got other coins that are almost in as heavy demand.
[03:49:31.540 --> 03:49:41.583]  You're going to try to get more of the Buffalos next week so we can offer those again, but tell folks what you've got if they want to convert some of their paper assets before the globalists steal it all into precious metals.
[03:49:42.023 --> 03:49:44.245]  Well, first of all, I couldn't believe I ran into it.
[03:49:44.245 --> 03:49:48.928]  I've got about 10 of these bags of Franklin Haves, which is unheard of.
[03:49:48.928 --> 03:49:51.489]  That's the coin that was made before the Kennedy.
[03:49:51.489 --> 03:49:53.471]  And Franklin Haves are real tough right now.
[03:49:53.471 --> 03:49:54.571]  Everything's real tough right now.
[03:49:54.571 --> 03:49:56.332]  There's no question about it.
[03:49:56.332 --> 03:49:59.074]  I had to stop promoting the Walking Liberties because I couldn't get them anymore.
[03:49:59.074 --> 03:50:01.416]  That's the one before the Franklin.
[03:50:01.416 --> 03:50:02.496]  They're currently right now at $8.70 apiece.
[03:50:05.078 --> 03:50:07.840]  And I can't believe they just passed that thing.
[03:50:07.840 --> 03:50:10.081]  It drives me, you know... And that's silver.
[03:50:10.081 --> 03:50:12.543]  We're going to talk about that when we get back at your take on things right now.
[03:50:12.543 --> 03:50:13.503]  Tell folks about the coins.
[03:50:13.503 --> 03:50:14.004]  Yeah, sure.
[03:50:14.004 --> 03:50:14.884]  I'll go back into it.
[03:50:14.884 --> 03:50:16.505]  The British Sovereign currently right now $234.
[03:50:16.505 --> 03:50:19.607]  The Frank right now is at $190.
[03:50:19.607 --> 03:50:24.750]  And I can tell you right now, both of those coins, the Sovereign and the Frank, are not available in the United States.
[03:50:24.750 --> 03:50:25.811]  Nobody can get them anymore.
[03:50:27.132 --> 03:50:28.895]  My sources are coming from Europe right now.
[03:50:28.895 --> 03:50:31.539]  That's the only place that I'm getting this stuff.
[03:50:31.539 --> 03:50:35.866]  These European coins are coming in, and I've got them coming in as fast as I can.
[03:50:35.866 --> 03:50:39.772]  To explain that, they made owning gold privately illegal in the 30s, and so...
[03:50:42.483 --> 03:50:47.948]  They did a scam where they sent all the gold to Europe for paper and that's why it's the only stuff you can get now is coming back.
[03:50:47.948 --> 03:50:48.508]  Stay there, Ted.
[03:50:48.508 --> 03:50:57.216]  I want to finish breaking this down and then get your take as a financial expert for close to 30 years on the banker takeover today, the threats of martial law.
[03:50:57.216 --> 03:50:58.357]  Unbelievable.
[03:50:58.357 --> 03:50:59.598]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:51:02.020 --> 03:51:05.101]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[03:51:05.101 --> 03:51:10.643]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[03:51:10.643 --> 03:51:16.345]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[03:51:16.345 --> 03:51:17.826]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:51:17.826 --> 03:51:26.709]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[03:51:26.869 --> 03:51:27.149]  Of course!
[03:51:27.149 --> 03:51:28.990]  Now compare a Cowbend Pure Soap.

[03:54:46.180 --> 03:54:51.263]  Try to kill it all away.
[03:54:51.263 --> 03:54:55.586]  But I remember everything.

[03:55:06.873 --> 03:55:08.234]  Everyone I know.
[03:55:08.234 --> 03:55:13.357]  Everyone I know goes away.
[03:55:18.385 --> 03:55:21.910]  And you could have it all.
[03:55:21.910 --> 03:55:24.473]  The empire of dirt.
[03:55:24.473 --> 03:55:27.076]  My empire of dirt.
[03:55:27.076 --> 03:55:28.999]  I will let you in.
[03:55:28.999 --> 03:55:31.902]  I will let you down.
[03:55:38.988 --> 03:55:42.129]  Yeah, the empire of dirt, the paper money they used to take over the U.S.
[03:55:42.129 --> 03:55:43.610]  and the world, coming down.
[03:55:43.610 --> 03:55:50.032]  Ted Anderson, finish up with those coins and I'm going to get your take on what just happened with the banker takeover.
[03:55:50.032 --> 03:55:51.513]  Yeah, sure, I'd be happy to go with it.
[03:55:51.513 --> 03:55:57.735]  I mean, you asked me a question going into the break about why is the gold chipped to Europe in that time.
[03:55:57.735 --> 03:56:02.437]  When FDR confiscated gold in 1933, they set up a new standard that allowed
[03:56:02.817 --> 03:56:06.180]  Foreigners, foreign banks, to exchange their currency back, U.S.
[03:56:06.180 --> 03:56:08.221]  currency, for gold still, but the U.S.
[03:56:08.221 --> 03:56:09.723]  citizens couldn't.
[03:56:09.723 --> 03:56:17.068]  As they devaluated their currency and gold began to rise, it got up above $33 an ounce, which was the standard at that time.
[03:56:17.068 --> 03:56:22.413]  And so people started, in foreign nations, started requesting gold over paper currency.
[03:56:22.413 --> 03:56:30.859]  In addition to that, when we bailed off all those European countries after World War II, the destruction, we sent a lot of gold over to them, too, because nobody trusted us.
[03:56:32.060 --> 03:56:37.162]  You're one of the biggest and best dealers out there, so you've been able to get a lot of stuff that people can't get any more quickly.
[03:56:37.162 --> 03:56:37.863]  Tell them the coins.
[03:56:37.863 --> 03:56:39.484]  Yeah, I'll go with it right now.
[03:56:39.484 --> 03:56:42.645]  We have British Sovereigns, currently they're at $234.
[03:56:42.645 --> 03:56:47.027]  We have Franks at $190, and I'm not kidding you, there are none in the United States to buy.
[03:56:47.027 --> 03:56:53.390]  And then we also have the Franklin Half, which is, you know... A fabulous silver coin, and you've got a bunch of them.
[03:56:53.390 --> 03:56:54.631]  Yeah, I've got ten bags.
[03:56:55.911 --> 03:57:00.035]  Limited, obviously, but really definitely something that you should get into at this time.
[03:57:00.035 --> 03:57:01.896]  I guess 10 bags isn't a lot for me, it sounds like a lot.
[03:57:01.896 --> 03:57:03.277]  Well, 10 bags at $1,000 per face, which means there's 20,000 coins.
[03:57:03.277 --> 03:57:04.899]  That's not an awful lot, and it's $8.70 a piece.
[03:57:12.125 --> 03:57:12.846]  We're good.
[03:57:27.763 --> 03:57:39.230]  Folks, by buying low so he can sell, you know, to you on a tie, but I mean, he's buying these right at what they are and basically just getting them out the door so he can, you know, introduce you to being the customers and into precious metals.
[03:57:39.230 --> 03:57:41.992]  With all that's happening, they've signaled they're going to kill the dollar.
[03:57:41.992 --> 03:57:45.955]  They are going to kill us with inflation, move into metals now.
[03:57:45.955 --> 03:57:49.097]  They may even try to come after them later, but that's after they've already got your bank money.
[03:57:49.097 --> 03:57:54.240]  So this is another stopgap measure, a hedge against inflation, an emergency purse.
[03:57:54.660 --> 03:57:54.920]  1-800-686-2237.
[03:57:54.920 --> 03:58:02.528]  Got those, you know, great half dollars in silver.
[03:58:02.528 --> 03:58:03.930]  Gorgeous.
[03:58:03.930 --> 03:58:09.416]  You've got the gold that's very collectible because you can't even get them right now.
[03:58:09.416 --> 03:58:09.816]  800-686-2237.
[03:58:09.816 --> 03:58:10.917]  Great deals on that.
[03:58:10.917 --> 03:58:11.798]  Ted, thanks for coming on.
[03:58:11.798 --> 03:58:12.599]  What'd you think of the bailout?
[03:58:13.079 --> 03:58:17.181]  Oh, you know, it's the worst-case scenario that could have ever come across to the United States citizens.
[03:58:17.181 --> 03:58:19.802]  We are in big trouble financially.
[03:58:19.802 --> 03:58:20.922]  And it's only the beginning.
[03:58:20.922 --> 03:58:22.363]  Ted, I'll talk to you after the show.
[03:58:22.363 --> 03:58:23.023]  God bless you.
[03:58:23.023 --> 03:58:24.083]  Yep, thanks, Alex.
[03:58:24.083 --> 03:58:24.364]  You bet.
[03:58:24.364 --> 03:58:28.585]  Ladies and gentlemen, one of the most, or the most powerful transmissions I've ever done.
[03:58:28.585 --> 03:58:32.707]  Jam-packed, breaking down what's really happening in martial law in the House.
[03:58:32.707 --> 03:58:36.728]  Them being forced to vote on this under threat of martial law and quote, blood in the streets.
[03:58:36.728 --> 03:58:40.730]  We'll be right back in one minute, not on the AM and FM, but at InfoWars.com on the streams.
