[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.290]  We're good.
[00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.541]  We're live, my friends.
[00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:35.685]  I am chomping at the bit to expose the ongoing criminal activities of the global crime system known as the New World Order.
[00:00:35.685 --> 00:00:36.106]  Welcome.
[00:00:36.106 --> 00:00:38.287]  It is the 12th day of May, 2008.
[00:00:38.287 --> 00:00:44.770]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours, Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:45.390]  to 3 p.m.
[00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.453]  Central Standard Time, retransmitted on the network from 9 p.m.
[00:00:49.453 --> 00:00:49.873]  to 1 a.m.
[00:00:56.098 --> 00:01:07.890]  We have a ton of vital information that we're going to be covering today for you.
[00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.875]  Let me go ahead and just launch into some of it that I have here in front of me.
[00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:15.178]  First off, I got a call yesterday
[00:01:16.078 --> 00:01:29.427]  By an individual living in East Texas whose friend is a young associate pastor and is about to graduate with his doctorate from a local Bible college.
[00:01:29.427 --> 00:01:37.552]  They had a group of Boy Scouts come into the office, into the college.
[00:01:40.481 --> 00:01:45.885]  When they came in to the school, he didn't even give them an anti-New World Order speech.
[00:01:45.885 --> 00:02:02.659]  He just taught them Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights, Constitution, just gave a speech on the subject, and one of the people that brought the students in recorded it being Homeland Security trained, knowing that you don't talk about the Bill of Rights, Constitution, Declaration of Independence.
[00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.541]  We have Homeland Security training videos.
[00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:11.943]  FEMA training videos where they say that that's illegal and unlawful and not to be discussed in a terrorist document.
[00:02:11.943 --> 00:02:15.864]  By the way, this is not Monty Python satire.
[00:02:15.864 --> 00:02:17.345]  This is not a joke.
[00:02:17.345 --> 00:02:18.845]  This is not a game.
[00:02:18.845 --> 00:02:20.946]  This is not a drill.
[00:02:20.946 --> 00:02:23.887]  We've been documenting this since before 9-11.
[00:02:23.887 --> 00:02:30.889]  And so the person recorded him saying this and Homeland Security was waiting for him with the head of the school
[00:02:31.784 --> 00:02:39.352]  And the guy was in a black suit wearing sunglasses and said, you could be arrested for inciting terrorism.
[00:02:39.352 --> 00:02:48.362]  Now the individual, I don't want to say is scared to come on, but says they don't want to give the school a bad name and they just want to have the mission of saving souls.
[00:02:48.362 --> 00:02:53.307]  But they admit that, well, if they don't go on air, this is a great tyranny to the country.
[00:02:54.048 --> 00:02:59.753]  I know we won't even have any freedom in this nation, much less First Amendment religious freedom, but this type of stuff continues.
[00:02:59.753 --> 00:03:06.258]  Now, I have training manuals, I have government documents, I have video of this, and we're going to write a story and post all of this.
[00:03:06.258 --> 00:03:18.808]  We also know that 26,000 preachers have been recruited to train their flocks, to hand in their guns, go to FEMA camps, let their families be broken up, go to work labor facilities.
[00:03:18.808 --> 00:03:23.392]  I told you this, of course, a year and a half before, gave you secret documents, and now it's on the news.
[00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:35.564]  I mean, just think of the magnitude of this, and how on its face it is hyper-classical tyranny out of Soviet Russia or Nazi Germany.
[00:03:35.564 --> 00:03:41.707]  I mean, this is so off the charts that it's so amazing that it's going on.
[00:03:41.707 --> 00:03:48.810]  But I will have one of the individuals on the show, maybe both, coming up in about 25 minutes.
[00:03:54.941 --> 00:03:58.722]  So, that will be coming up today.
[00:03:58.722 --> 00:04:08.765]  Now, understand, the police and military and all government minions, they swear an oath to protect, defend, uphold the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:04:08.765 --> 00:04:18.207]  But I have FEMA on video teaching police in, of course, Kansas City.
[00:04:18.207 --> 00:04:23.449]  I was also shown video of it being done in Austin, Texas, at an event.
[00:04:24.176 --> 00:04:25.377]  That was six years ago.
[00:04:25.377 --> 00:04:29.979]  The folks that showed me the video at the time agreed with Homeland Security and wouldn't let me use it.
[00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:30.960]  Now they've kind of woken up.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.882]  I need to call them back and see if they'll let me use the video now.
[00:04:34.882 --> 00:04:36.283]  But what's even the point?
[00:04:36.283 --> 00:04:41.325]  Yeah, they said, yeah, you can watch the video, but you can't play the video.
[00:04:41.325 --> 00:04:43.606]  Saying that... I forgot.
[00:04:43.606 --> 00:04:45.267]  I need to call them and get that video.
[00:04:45.267 --> 00:04:46.468]  I think now they've woken up.
[00:04:46.468 --> 00:04:48.909]  They realize it's not good.
[00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:49.590]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.970]  Stay with us.
[00:04:54.355 --> 00:04:55.776]  It is a big idea.
[00:04:55.776 --> 00:04:58.579]  A New World Order.
[00:04:58.579 --> 00:05:03.042]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:05:03.042 --> 00:05:06.325]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:05:06.325 --> 00:05:09.107]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:05:09.107 --> 00:05:12.290]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:19.616]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:22.625 --> 00:05:28.069]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:31.951]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:31.951 --> 00:05:34.513]  Builderburg is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:34.513 --> 00:05:35.674]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:35.674 --> 00:05:36.474]  They're not after money.
[00:05:36.474 --> 00:05:37.735]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:37.735 --> 00:05:38.716]  They're after power.
[00:05:38.716 --> 00:05:39.877]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:52.445]  You have been warned.
[00:05:53.346 --> 00:05:58.710]  The Federal Trade Commission estimates that 9 million Americans are victims of identity theft each year.
[00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.574]  The crime of identity theft occurs every 3.5 seconds, costing the victims an average of $8,000.
[00:06:03.574 --> 00:06:11.560]  If you own a PC, passwords are a common form of authentication and often the only protection between a hacker and your personal information.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:20.882]  Passwords that are stored in a spreadsheet, text file, data file, or any other file that is not encrypted and password protected are vulnerable to malicious theft and misuse.

[00:06:56.823 --> 00:06:59.184]  We're already under a scientific dictatorship.
[00:06:59.184 --> 00:07:02.686]  Martial Law is coming, but it's not going to arrive overnight.
[00:07:02.686 --> 00:07:04.667]  It's going to be incremental.
[00:07:04.667 --> 00:07:06.648]  This country is already teetering on the edge.
[00:07:06.648 --> 00:07:09.730]  Any incident, small or large, could trigger a total takeover.
[00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.211]  Anything could be the final push.
[00:07:11.211 --> 00:07:17.074]  Visit survivemartiallaw.com and download the e-book full of information that will prepare you for life under total military control.
[00:07:17.074 --> 00:07:20.016]  Know how to survive in the conditions that may soon be here on American soil.
[00:07:20.396 --> 00:07:25.280]  Learn how to act around controlling troops, and how to use their own psychology against them through social engineering.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:31.906]  When martial law is officially announced, checkpoints will be enforced, gun confiscations will occur for registered gun owners, and cities will be on lockdown.
[00:07:31.906 --> 00:07:35.769]  You will be dealing with a force that has been in training for years, preparing for this takeover.

[00:07:42.815 --> 00:07:43.135]  That's 866-644-1933.
[00:08:02.253 --> 00:08:06.714]  Everybody knows that the dice are loaded.
[00:08:06.714 --> 00:08:11.456]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[00:08:11.456 --> 00:08:16.078]  Everybody knows the war is over.
[00:08:16.078 --> 00:08:19.499]  Everybody knows the good guy's lost.
[00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:30.604]  My life is like... I just had to talk to a young associate pastor in East Texas.
[00:08:30.604 --> 00:08:32.044]  We'll just cover when the song's over.
[00:08:48.288 --> 00:08:53.371]  Everybody got this broken feeling.
[00:08:53.371 --> 00:08:57.514]  Like their father or their dog just died.
[00:08:57.514 --> 00:09:02.097]  Everybody talking to their pockets.
[00:09:02.097 --> 00:09:11.222]  Everybody wants a box of chocolates and a long stem rose.
[00:09:11.222 --> 00:09:12.603]  Everybody knows.
[00:09:15.928 --> 00:09:20.510]  Everybody knows that you love me, baby.
[00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:25.092]  Everybody knows that you really do.
[00:09:25.092 --> 00:09:30.555]  Everybody knows that you've been faithful.
[00:09:30.555 --> 00:09:33.176]  I give or take a night or two.
[00:09:34.336 --> 00:09:38.037]  Alright, we're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:38.037 --> 00:09:48.300]  It is so upsetting to me what's happening that I can hardly continue this radio show.
[00:10:04.682 --> 00:10:13.149]  I had to stifle smashing the microphone and computer in my studio about 20 seconds ago, okay?
[00:10:13.149 --> 00:10:15.090]  That's how serious this is.
[00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:17.592]  That's how life and death this is.
[00:10:17.592 --> 00:10:20.574]  That's how far gone this country is.
[00:10:20.574 --> 00:10:22.736]  That's how cowed we are.
[00:10:22.736 --> 00:10:30.222]  That's how we're going into a scientific dictatorship where they're incrementally putting the shackles on tighter every minute.
[00:10:34.278 --> 00:10:51.336]  I was talking to the young pastor who's finishing getting his degree at a major Bible school in East Texas, his theology degree, having to beg him and convince him to come on the show, and I know he's listening right now, along with his friend who called me.
[00:10:54.577 --> 00:11:05.201]  And of course, you know, he is saying, well, we do have these outreach programs to Communist China, and so I don't want to hurt the school's name and hurt what we're doing and, you know, hurt the missionary programs.
[00:11:05.201 --> 00:11:11.984]  And I said, sir, we're going to be the equivalent of Communist China or Nazi Germany if we don't end this now.
[00:11:11.984 --> 00:11:12.804]  I mean, that's the point.
[00:11:12.804 --> 00:11:20.167]  Is this country so far gone that the best of the best of who we are, I mean, because most people don't even have the courage to call me,
[00:11:21.192 --> 00:11:32.401]  Are afraid to go on air and talk about how Homeland Security comes to them and says you are not to teach the Bill of Rights to people.
[00:11:32.401 --> 00:11:34.342]  That is a terrorist document.
[00:11:34.342 --> 00:11:41.107]  Reading the Bill of Rights is incitement to terrorism.
[00:11:41.107 --> 00:11:43.769]  That's how bad all of this is.
[00:11:43.769 --> 00:11:46.752]  That's how screwed up all of this is.
[00:11:46.752 --> 00:11:48.573]  That's how far we've fallen.
[00:11:48.573 --> 00:11:49.814]  How far we've gone.
[00:11:51.883 --> 00:11:53.925]  Now I'm going to say it again for everybody out there.
[00:11:53.925 --> 00:12:11.859]  I know we've talked about this a lot, but we have video in Road to Tyranny that a Kansas City firefighter shot of FEMA teaching a room of police, deputies, and firemen that the Founding Fathers are bad terrorists and that the Founding Fathers were bad.
[00:12:11.859 --> 00:12:15.502]  But that isn't even where it begins.
[00:12:15.502 --> 00:12:17.183]  I have, this is from Bill Clinton,
[00:12:18.095 --> 00:12:41.609]  Call a member of the Phoenix FBI Terrorism Task Force, Investigator Al Shearer, Maricopa County Attorney's Office, 602-650-3131, Federal Bureau of Investigation, 602-650-3163, Analyst Terry Chapman, Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, this is how they analyze us,
[00:12:42.378 --> 00:12:55.922]  And it says, if you encounter any of the following, call the Joint Terrorism Task Force, Federal Bureau of Investigation, 201 East Indianola Avenue, Phoenix, Arizona, 85012.
[00:12:55.922 --> 00:13:04.445]  And this is from 1999, and it says, call the FBI if you identify any of these terror groups.
[00:13:04.445 --> 00:13:07.046]  Anyone who, quote, says they are defenders of the U.S.
[00:13:07.046 --> 00:13:10.407]  Constitution against federal government and, quote, U.N.
[00:13:10.407 --> 00:13:10.767]  troops.
[00:13:11.613 --> 00:13:15.075]  Groups of individuals engaging in paramilitary training.
[00:13:15.075 --> 00:13:18.598]  Common law movement proponents.
[00:13:18.598 --> 00:13:23.581]  And it goes on to say, no driver's license, refuse identify self, request authority for stop.
[00:13:23.581 --> 00:13:25.523]  See, you talk to the cop, you get tasered.
[00:13:25.523 --> 00:13:27.004]  Make numerous references to the U.S.
[00:13:27.004 --> 00:13:28.125]  Constitution.
[00:13:28.125 --> 00:13:30.566]  Claim driving is a right, not a privilege.
[00:13:30.566 --> 00:13:31.827]  Attempt to police the police.
[00:13:31.827 --> 00:13:34.709]  Yeah, how dare citizens be involved?
[00:13:34.709 --> 00:13:35.710]  It goes on to say,
[00:13:36.724 --> 00:13:42.606]  Second Amendment organizations, Second Amendment rights groups, land rights groups.
[00:13:42.606 --> 00:13:44.806]  You understand?
[00:13:44.806 --> 00:13:54.209]  And there are neocon organizations that will say that this flyer isn't even real when it was in the Washington Times reported on it.
[00:13:54.209 --> 00:13:56.970]  The Associated Press reported on it at the time it was out.
[00:13:57.768 --> 00:14:00.930]  But I've got FEMA on video saying worse stuff.
[00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:06.974]  Do you understand that they have 26,000 preachers and they're doubling their number in 2008?
[00:14:06.974 --> 00:14:12.697]  And we now see it on national television with the preacher programs on TBN.
[00:14:12.697 --> 00:14:15.439]  We see the local preacher shows all over the country.
[00:14:15.439 --> 00:14:19.962]  They all, for their egomania, have their local TV show where they sit there and beg for money.
[00:14:21.255 --> 00:14:26.979]  And they say, being a slave to government is good, handing in your guns is good, do whatever they say.
[00:14:26.979 --> 00:14:29.861]  I mean, it is just absolutely sick.
[00:14:29.861 --> 00:14:35.605]  They are government stooges, total violation of the First Amendment.
[00:14:35.605 --> 00:14:45.371]  So, of course, they teach that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[00:14:45.371 --> 00:14:49.194]  And during the last break, I had to beg the guest
[00:14:49.853 --> 00:15:05.763]  To keep his guts together and to come on the show, but I said we'll leave it up to you whether you're going to say your name and the name of the East Texas School, the name of the college.
[00:15:05.763 --> 00:15:07.705]  Now, I have the documents.
[00:15:07.705 --> 00:15:08.705]  I have the video.
[00:15:08.705 --> 00:15:09.786]  I have the news articles.
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:24.854]  We have the secret FEMA training for the pastors a year and a half before it happened and we had pastors on who then had Homeland Security come to their offices and say how dare you talk about the secret program and kick them out of it when they recruited them in the first place.
[00:15:26.678 --> 00:15:28.338]  Then it came out in the news.
[00:15:28.338 --> 00:15:30.079]  Do you read me?
[00:15:30.079 --> 00:15:31.519]  This is happening.
[00:15:31.519 --> 00:15:46.982]  And in case you don't know history, when you've got secret police liaisoning and co-opting your local police, your local mayors, your local leaders, your local preachers, it doesn't get any worse and anti-freedom and pro-tyranny than that.
[00:15:46.982 --> 00:15:50.783]  I mean, that is the most... They're building camps.
[00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:51.883]  Do you understand?
[00:15:51.883 --> 00:15:53.744]  They're building FEMA camps.
[00:15:53.744 --> 00:15:55.064]  They're building camps.
[00:15:55.894 --> 00:15:58.896]  They're amassing millions of police and riot police.
[00:15:58.896 --> 00:16:02.998]  This is not for Al-Qaeda, even if you believe it exists.
[00:16:02.998 --> 00:16:11.022]  The entire system is designed for you, those that have licked their boots, those of you that have toadied them.
[00:16:11.022 --> 00:16:18.606]  You understand this is a criminal group moving against you, and they use the smokescreen of the terror they staged to do it.
[00:16:18.606 --> 00:16:23.449]  The United States is not about a young pastor who's finishing his doctorate at a school,
[00:16:24.679 --> 00:16:26.923]  Freedom is not teaching Cub Scouts about the Bill of Rights.
[00:16:37.125 --> 00:16:43.908]  See, yesterday, when I first heard about this, I thought he was giving them, you know, a truly, you know, super patriotic message.
[00:16:43.908 --> 00:16:56.014]  No, no, no, it turns out, now learning more details, he just taught them what he learned when he was a Boy Scout about, you know, protect the freedoms, liberties, Bill of Rights, Constitution, what they taught when I was in Cub Scouts.
[00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:58.991]  Not anymore, folks.
[00:16:58.991 --> 00:17:00.112]  And it was recorded.
[00:17:00.112 --> 00:17:02.535]  See, the issue is that there were adults there.
[00:17:02.535 --> 00:17:03.856]  There was the scout leader there.
[00:17:03.856 --> 00:17:05.317]  There were some parents there.
[00:17:05.317 --> 00:17:08.901]  And they had been given the FBI training all over the nation.
[00:17:08.901 --> 00:17:12.284]  They send out flyers saying, please come to the local community center.
[00:17:12.284 --> 00:17:14.186]  We're going to have an anti-terror training seminar.
[00:17:14.186 --> 00:17:15.888]  We want community volunteers.
[00:17:15.888 --> 00:17:17.590]  And people hear that and they think it's interesting.
[00:17:18.237 --> 00:17:23.278]  And they go to it, and then once they get there, they learn, okay, we're going to fight terror and all crime.
[00:17:23.278 --> 00:17:24.819]  Spy on your neighbor.
[00:17:24.819 --> 00:17:27.539]  Are they dumping motor oil in their backyard?
[00:17:27.539 --> 00:17:30.800]  Do they spank their children?
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.441]  Do you smell marijuana?
[00:17:33.441 --> 00:17:38.922]  And by the way, constitutional patriots, they talk about the Bill of Rights.
[00:17:38.922 --> 00:17:41.843]  That's terrorist code.
[00:17:41.843 --> 00:17:43.504]  That's exactly what happened here.
[00:17:43.504 --> 00:17:44.504]  Do you understand?
[00:17:45.875 --> 00:17:53.002]  In the United States, talking about the Constitution gets Homeland Security after you.
[00:17:53.002 --> 00:17:54.123]  Now, it's all intimidation.
[00:17:54.123 --> 00:17:58.167]  The criminals doing this at Homeland Security know that they're terrorists.
[00:17:58.167 --> 00:17:59.969]  They know what they're doing.
[00:17:59.969 --> 00:18:02.772]  They know they're there to intimidate and shut down freedom and liberty.
[00:18:03.408 --> 00:18:10.113]  They know, and they're there to intimidate you, and they count on you being quiet, and they count on you not speaking out.
[00:18:10.113 --> 00:18:11.514]  I mean, this is case closed!
[00:18:11.514 --> 00:18:20.962]  The government is teaching the police, the preachers, the citizens, that the Bill of Rights is illegal.
[00:18:20.962 --> 00:18:25.545]  Now, again, I've seen hundreds of cases of this, but I'll use the one that affects, you know, that happened to one of our people.
[00:18:25.545 --> 00:18:30.269]  Kelly Rushing, upstanding, no criminal record, Lyon County, Kentucky.
[00:18:31.181 --> 00:18:42.730]  Gives a police officer a videotape with a Ron Paul video, neocon speech he gave, that's the title of the speech, 47 minutes long, and then Road to Tyranny.
[00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:54.580]  And it so freaked out, he had such a crisis of conscience, conscience, that the state police officer saw FEMA saying the Constitution's evil, America's bad, the Founding Fathers, George Washington is bad.
[00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:55.901]  It's all the videos on there!
[00:18:56.946 --> 00:19:03.229]  Abby Newman being arrested in Virginia at a checkpoint for having a pocket constitution.
[00:19:03.229 --> 00:19:05.931]  The state troopers saying the constitution's illegal.
[00:19:05.931 --> 00:19:07.532]  All on video.
[00:19:07.532 --> 00:19:12.054]  See, we don't just have the training, we have it happening from the squad car, video.
[00:19:12.054 --> 00:19:14.095]  That he had a mental illness flip-out.
[00:19:14.095 --> 00:19:19.358]  He had to go ahead and say, yes, it is terrorism, and then they arrested him.
[00:19:19.358 --> 00:19:26.322]  Instead of saying, my God, I've been wrong, I've been deceived, how could what I swear an oath to be illegal, they went and arrested him.
[00:19:28.382 --> 00:19:34.366]  You see, it's the boldness of Homeland Security to say that George Washington is bad.
[00:19:34.366 --> 00:19:37.828]  The boldness of saying the Bill of Rights is illegal.
[00:19:37.828 --> 00:19:41.030]  The boldness to recruit secretly preachers.
[00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:45.393]  The boldness to build FEMA camps for political dissidents.
[00:19:45.393 --> 00:19:49.576]  It is so bold that a lot of people just buy it.
[00:19:49.576 --> 00:19:51.758]  Well, he's got the courage to come on.
[00:19:51.758 --> 00:19:53.078]  He's coming on.
[00:19:53.078 --> 00:19:53.599]  Stay with us.
[00:19:55.148 --> 00:19:57.850]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:07.319]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:07.319 --> 00:20:14.405]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:15.126 --> 00:20:21.114]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:21.114 --> 00:20:31.908]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:32.669 --> 00:20:33.089]  It is a big idea.
[00:20:33.089 --> 00:20:34.150]  A new world order.
[00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:35.410]  In the near future.
[00:21:00.367 --> 00:21:03.410]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:06.253]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:21:06.253 --> 00:21:09.035]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[00:21:09.035 --> 00:21:12.239]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:21:12.239 --> 00:21:19.546]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:21:22.571 --> 00:21:28.015]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:21:28.015 --> 00:21:31.897]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:21:31.897 --> 00:21:34.459]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:21:34.459 --> 00:21:35.620]  Most people have no idea.
[00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:36.400]  They're not after money.
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.681]  They have all the money they need.
[00:21:37.681 --> 00:21:38.662]  They're after power.
[00:21:38.662 --> 00:21:39.823]  That's what they have to lose here.
[00:21:39.823 --> 00:21:48.528]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:21:48.528 --> 00:21:51.350]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:52.431]  You have been warned.
[00:21:53.252 --> 00:21:54.072]  Hey, Emily.
[00:21:54.072 --> 00:21:55.173]  Wow, you look great.
[00:21:55.173 --> 00:21:56.214]  I feel great.
[00:21:56.214 --> 00:21:58.276]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[00:21:58.276 --> 00:21:58.817]  Really?
[00:21:58.817 --> 00:21:59.437]  What is it?
[00:21:59.437 --> 00:22:00.118]  How does it work?
[00:22:00.118 --> 00:22:06.844]  MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from your body.
[00:22:06.844 --> 00:22:09.347]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[00:22:09.347 --> 00:22:14.652]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[00:22:14.992 --> 00:22:15.472]  That's it?
[00:22:15.472 --> 00:22:17.533]  Well, it sounds so easy and convenient.
[00:22:17.533 --> 00:22:18.454]  It is easy.
[00:22:18.454 --> 00:22:25.438]  Plus, the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[00:22:25.438 --> 00:22:27.258]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[00:22:27.258 --> 00:22:28.399]  That's amazing!
[00:22:28.399 --> 00:22:33.742]  And, the bentonite clay and MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[00:22:34.022 --> 00:22:34.582]  Well, how?
[00:22:34.582 --> 00:22:35.983]  Where can I buy a MediCleanse?
[00:22:35.983 --> 00:22:38.905]  A one-month supply is available online at MediCleanse.com.

[00:22:53.216 --> 00:22:55.217]  Her beloved republic is on her knees.
[00:22:55.217 --> 00:22:58.819]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:22:58.819 --> 00:23:00.661]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:23:01.261 --> 00:23:04.304]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:23:04.304 --> 00:23:10.029]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:23:10.029 --> 00:23:14.293]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:23:14.293 --> 00:23:19.498]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[00:23:19.498 --> 00:23:22.540]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[00:23:35.732 --> 00:23:37.574]  My weekly news television broadcast.
[00:23:37.574 --> 00:23:40.516]  Thousands of exclusive audio interviews and so much more.
[00:23:40.516 --> 00:23:43.419]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.
[00:23:43.419 --> 00:23:45.460]  Join PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:47.462]  Burn the info bombs to disk.
[00:23:47.462 --> 00:23:49.584]  Put them on the file sharing networks.
[00:23:49.584 --> 00:23:51.366]  Bring down the New World Order.
[00:23:51.366 --> 00:23:52.126]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:23:55.951 --> 00:23:58.033]  Look, this is what it comes down to.
[00:23:58.033 --> 00:24:00.915]  I can't believe that I'm a radical.
[00:24:00.915 --> 00:24:07.900]  I can't believe that I'm seen as extreme.
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:13.764]  Because I flipped out when I went to Urban Warfare Drills and videotaped U.S.
[00:24:13.764 --> 00:24:20.749]  Marines with foreign troops on video saying they were training to execute American citizens.
[00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:29.015]  And practicing putting us on our knees and blowing our heads off!
[00:24:29.015 --> 00:24:31.597]  Of course I came back and warned everyone.
[00:24:31.597 --> 00:24:33.339]  Of course I put the video out.
[00:24:33.339 --> 00:24:47.229]  And the mind-control public, hundreds of emails and calls, said that I hired a Marine Corps aircraft carrier, the medium-sized ones, the USS Coronado, that I hired hovercraft, that I hired thousands of troops,
[00:24:50.157 --> 00:24:55.942]  Instead of just going to the Marine Corps website where they have their own photos of it.
[00:24:55.942 --> 00:24:58.104]  That's the denial!
[00:24:58.104 --> 00:25:08.072]  Because people couldn't believe the Marines are training to put you on your knees and stick a muzzle to the back of your head and blow your brains out in front of your kids, okay?
[00:25:08.072 --> 00:25:12.416]  You know, that'll make you lose sleep at night, seeing that ten years ago.
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:16.923]  And trying to warn people that they've been gearing up all along.
[00:25:16.923 --> 00:25:20.085]  And don't give me your crap about, what, are you against our Marines?
[00:25:20.085 --> 00:25:22.247]  You bet I am if they're against this country.
[00:25:22.247 --> 00:25:25.229]  You bet I am if they want to kill American citizens.
[00:25:25.229 --> 00:25:27.030]  I'm not against the individual Marines.
[00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:28.972]  I'm against the training they've been getting.
[00:25:28.972 --> 00:25:30.313]  Just like I'm not against guns.
[00:25:30.313 --> 00:25:31.734]  I'm against them being misused.
[00:25:33.553 --> 00:25:34.854]  You're so brainwashed.
[00:25:34.854 --> 00:25:36.075]  You think you're in Kansas.
[00:25:36.075 --> 00:25:37.295]  You think everything's nice.
[00:25:37.295 --> 00:25:37.856]  It's okay.
[00:25:37.856 --> 00:25:38.556]  It's not.
[00:25:38.556 --> 00:25:40.857]  They're dismantling the country right now.
[00:25:40.857 --> 00:25:49.743]  They've geared up the police and military so that when you try to stop their total takeover, when you finally figure it out, they're gonna gun you down in the streets.
[00:25:49.743 --> 00:25:55.767]  They're gonna have their ninnying preachers and their snake oil salesmen running around the streets telling you to go along with it.
[00:25:55.767 --> 00:25:58.228]  And the local news is gonna tell you to go along with it.
[00:25:58.228 --> 00:25:59.669]  When I'm dead in some ditch,
[00:26:00.871 --> 00:26:04.033]  When these murdering drug dealers have had their way with me!
[00:26:04.033 --> 00:26:10.296]  Because you were weak and stupid, they're gonna take everything you've got, you nation of cowards!
[00:26:10.296 --> 00:26:13.037]  I'm gonna tell you something right now.
[00:26:13.037 --> 00:26:18.720]  The fact that, and these guys have more courage than most people.
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:27.425]  I've begged hundreds of preachers, and I've begged hundreds of people going to colleges to come on and talk about this stuff and give their names, and they'll never do it!
[00:26:27.425 --> 00:26:29.786]  The ones that have that Homeland Security come after them.
[00:26:31.132 --> 00:26:35.437]  But what is coming after him coming to him and saying, we're watching you now, you shouldn't have talked!
[00:26:35.437 --> 00:26:38.100]  You shouldn't have talked in our country!
[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.121]  Shouldn't have talked!
[00:26:39.121 --> 00:26:41.644]  Shouldn't have talked about how there's secret police everywhere!
[00:26:41.644 --> 00:26:43.125]  And how they've recruited everybody!
[00:26:43.125 --> 00:26:45.147]  And how our country's going down the tubes!
[00:26:45.147 --> 00:26:46.709]  We gotta stop these people!
[00:26:46.709 --> 00:26:49.052]  They can't succeed if we expose them!
[00:26:51.278 --> 00:27:02.349]  Meanwhile, our movement does nothing but fight with each other and ninny about who likes who and who covers what group and who covers, you know, this group and who knows all the answers and who's exactly right.
[00:27:02.349 --> 00:27:06.453]  Look, all I know is they're carrying eugenics out against us.
[00:27:06.453 --> 00:27:15.082]  All these dumb preachers that are going along with us, all these dumb cops, they're shooting you up full of mercury, cancer, viruses, everything else you can imagine, and that's just in the shots, you fools!
[00:27:16.881 --> 00:27:18.682]  All I know is they're spraying us!
[00:27:18.682 --> 00:27:27.729]  All I know is they're staging wars and devaluing our dollar and gutting us completely!
[00:27:27.729 --> 00:27:33.293]  Meanwhile, our own movement... Not the good people out there taking action.
[00:27:33.293 --> 00:27:41.238]  You're the reason we woke up so many people, but so many of the people that try to actually speak out and become prominent spend half their time attacking other patriots.
[00:27:41.238 --> 00:27:41.979]  I don't do that!
[00:27:43.271 --> 00:27:47.414]  Other people that got their heads screwed on straight like Mark Kornke and others don't do that.
[00:27:47.414 --> 00:27:50.055]  You gotta get your heads out of your hind ends.
[00:27:50.055 --> 00:27:53.177]  Excuse me for talking like that, but this is life and death!
[00:27:53.177 --> 00:27:56.079]  This isn't a game or a joke to me!
[00:27:56.079 --> 00:28:07.046]  Do you understand when men in black suits and sunglasses come and tell people at major colleges here in the United States that they're not allowed to teach children about the Bill of Rights?
[00:28:07.046 --> 00:28:08.167]  We got a problem!
[00:28:10.037 --> 00:28:13.900]  The people that teach that are terrorists on the face of it.
[00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:17.963]  The people that do that have declared themselves enemies of this country.
[00:28:17.963 --> 00:28:22.166]  You can't get a better declaration of their intent and who they are.
[00:28:22.166 --> 00:28:24.948]  They might as well run up the Jolly Roger.
[00:28:24.948 --> 00:28:26.590]  I mean, that is so piratical.
[00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:33.095]  That is so in your face.
[00:28:33.095 --> 00:28:36.237]  No, and this isn't a scene from Red Dawn at the re-education camp.
[00:28:37.526 --> 00:28:43.149]  Where they're calling your founding fathers a pig scum who were oppressing the lower classes.
[00:28:43.149 --> 00:28:53.573]  You ever watch that movie and it's a setting from what they really had in re-education camps in Eastern Europe when they take over Czechoslovakia, Romania, other places?
[00:28:53.573 --> 00:28:55.494]  East Germany?
[00:28:55.494 --> 00:28:55.935]  That's what they do.
[00:28:55.935 --> 00:29:01.157]  They take you to sports stadiums, have you tattle on each other, train you how to be scumbags, break you.
[00:29:02.239 --> 00:29:05.180]  They got their movie screens blurping out all their trash.
[00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:21.686]  That's exactly what you'd hear out of a Hollywood movie about Soviets taking over the United States would be men in black suits telling young pastors that they can't teach boy scouts about the Bill of Rights.
[00:29:21.686 --> 00:29:26.587]  Now we're going to talk to both these guys on the other side and it'll be up to them if they give their names.
[00:29:26.587 --> 00:29:28.668]  It'll be up to them if they talk about where this is happening.
[00:29:29.722 --> 00:29:35.086]  And in this country, this is major courage in this climate.
[00:29:35.086 --> 00:29:37.007]  I'm not attacking our guests, I'm saluting them.
[00:29:37.007 --> 00:29:44.092]  But for me, there's not even a debate about whether I would go public.
[00:29:44.092 --> 00:29:48.015]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:48.015 --> 00:29:50.697]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:54.079 --> 00:29:58.460]  Prepare for an uncertain future with DVDs from the winner of 12 Telly Awards.

[00:30:42.469 --> 00:30:42.910]  That's right.
[00:30:53.863 --> 00:30:55.464]  Wake up, Protestant America!
[00:30:55.464 --> 00:30:59.146]  There is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state.
[00:30:59.146 --> 00:31:05.189]  This confederation of Evangelicals, Catholics, and Protestant denominations will form one huge political voting bloc.
[00:31:05.189 --> 00:31:09.251]  Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation.
[00:31:09.251 --> 00:31:12.653]  Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom.
[00:31:12.853 --> 00:31:14.013]  Liberty of conscience.
[00:31:14.013 --> 00:31:18.674]  History and the Bible prove to them that these two systems, church and state, must be kept separate.
[00:31:18.674 --> 00:31:22.735]  It must be our love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us.
[00:31:22.735 --> 00:31:25.336]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement.
[00:31:25.336 --> 00:31:30.637]  From history we saw that when church and state united, known as Papal Rome, religious intolerance resulted.
[00:31:30.637 --> 00:31:34.298]  This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation.
[00:31:34.298 --> 00:31:36.879]  America and Papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[00:31:37.079 --> 00:31:39.862]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late!
[00:31:39.862 --> 00:31:41.785]  The prophecies are fast fulfilling!
[00:31:41.785 --> 00:31:43.367]  Jesus is coming soon!

[00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:59.972]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:31:59.972 --> 00:32:06.194]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business and the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[00:32:06.194 --> 00:32:09.395]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[00:33:04.006 --> 00:33:06.848]  Okay, we're gonna go ahead and go straight to our guests.
[00:33:06.848 --> 00:33:08.370]  One is Steve, one is Jeff.
[00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:13.294]  It's up to them if they want to, in the course of this interview, give their names.
[00:33:13.294 --> 00:33:17.117]  I know Steve does, but if he does, then that'll expose Jeff.
[00:33:17.117 --> 00:33:23.722]  This is one of the largest, I'll just say that, Christian universities in Texas.
[00:33:26.095 --> 00:33:30.966]  This is a major university.
[00:33:30.966 --> 00:33:33.011]  If I said the biggest, it would give it away.
[00:33:33.011 --> 00:33:35.136]  And this is what our country has turned into.
[00:33:35.136 --> 00:33:36.299]  Now understand, I have...
[00:33:37.023 --> 00:33:50.667]  The FBI training manual, and in the fourth hour when we're doing the TV show where we simulcast the radio as a television transmission for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers, I will show you the FBI flyer, FBI training manuals.
[00:33:50.667 --> 00:33:59.530]  In my film Road to Tyranny, we have video of FEMA teaching police in Kansas City and firemen that the Founding Fathers were bad and terrorists.
[00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:05.932]  Here it says constitutionalist, people that talk about the Constitution, those that make frequent references to the Constitution.
[00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:08.581]  Defenders of the U.S.
[00:34:08.581 --> 00:34:10.503]  Constitution are terrorists.
[00:34:10.503 --> 00:34:12.844]  Call the terrorism hotline immediately.
[00:34:12.844 --> 00:34:14.666]  The police are taught this nationwide.
[00:34:14.666 --> 00:34:20.570]  Now, first it was 13,000 preachers in 2006 when it was a secret program.
[00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:29.676]  We broke it here with secret, marked secret, not for distribution documents with the first 13,000 preachers recruited.
[00:34:29.676 --> 00:34:31.357]  And we had two different pastors on.
[00:34:31.357 --> 00:34:32.398]  Butch Paul actually broke it.
[00:34:32.398 --> 00:34:33.959]  We put it out nationwide here.
[00:34:33.959 --> 00:34:35.180]  We had the pastors on.
[00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:36.541]  One of them got a Homeland Security visit.
[00:34:37.923 --> 00:34:40.745]  Now, we put the secret documents up on the site.
[00:34:40.745 --> 00:34:53.271]  A year plus later, local news and then even national news reported that yes, but they said it was good, preachers are getting their flocks ready for martial law, to have their guns taken and to have their families taken.
[00:34:53.271 --> 00:35:01.755]  Now, the preachers told us they were trained to tell people to let the government take your children, to go to camps, to be forcibly inoculated, to go to labor facilities.
[00:35:01.755 --> 00:35:06.637]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, it then came out, okay,
[00:35:07.378 --> 00:35:10.241]  Now, we're telling you, this is a massive program.
[00:35:10.241 --> 00:35:14.724]  26,000 in InfraGard, major CEOs, community leaders.
[00:35:14.724 --> 00:35:17.407]  They are being paid, in many cases, federal money.
[00:35:17.407 --> 00:35:19.629]  The pastors are being paid to be part of this.
[00:35:19.629 --> 00:35:23.492]  The colleges are getting billions of dollars every year to be part of this.
[00:35:23.492 --> 00:35:26.214]  This is a total violation of the First Amendment.
[00:35:26.214 --> 00:35:28.717]  This is the government taking over.
[00:35:28.717 --> 00:35:30.218]  This is classical tyranny.
[00:35:31.088 --> 00:35:36.114]  And, but it's different to have a government training manual or a video of FEMA saying it.
[00:35:36.114 --> 00:35:43.842]  It's more powerful to have the state police pull Abby Newman over, no criminal record, naval veteran, in Virginia.
[00:35:43.842 --> 00:35:45.243]  This is in Road to Tyranny.
[00:35:45.243 --> 00:35:47.926]  She has a pocket constitution, one of my videos in the back.
[00:35:48.712 --> 00:35:51.553]  And they say, I think this is illegal, let's arrest her.
[00:35:51.553 --> 00:35:53.773]  I don't think she's allowed to have this contraband.
[00:35:53.773 --> 00:35:56.094]  And again, again, they swore an oath to it.
[00:35:56.094 --> 00:35:59.775]  We have state police saying a Constitution is contraband.
[00:35:59.775 --> 00:36:06.677]  Now, I know to the average listener, even mainstream people that are somewhat dumbed down, you're like, the Constitution's illegal?
[00:36:06.677 --> 00:36:10.278]  That's what I'm... This is so crazy!
[00:36:10.278 --> 00:36:12.459]  It's the boldness of this!
[00:36:12.459 --> 00:36:13.839]  It is so bold!
[00:36:13.839 --> 00:36:16.640]  I mean, I've got mainstream law enforcement magazines
[00:36:18.129 --> 00:36:31.043]  That say, like law enforcement technology in 2000 put out an issue and it said, if you see someone with a get us out of the UN sticker, go ahead and arrest them, find reasons to charge them, they're terrorists.
[00:36:31.043 --> 00:36:36.129]  And it said police chiefs, don't punish your officers, just support them for the arrest of the bumper sticker.
[00:36:37.333 --> 00:36:40.576]  I mean, and then I have the manual right here where it says it.
[00:36:40.576 --> 00:36:43.479]  Go ahead and call Homeland Security, call the FBI.
[00:36:43.479 --> 00:36:45.601]  They've got to get us out of the UN sticker.
[00:36:45.601 --> 00:36:47.563]  I mean, folks, it's so far gone.
[00:36:47.563 --> 00:36:50.406]  Huge black ops, FEMA camps built.
[00:36:50.406 --> 00:36:54.790]  I'm going to shut up now, but I know a lot of people will be tuning into this on YouTube and Google when it gets posted.
[00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:57.633]  I wanted them to hear an introduction to this to understand.
[00:36:57.633 --> 00:37:00.296]  And what I've given you is a small piece of it.
[00:37:00.296 --> 00:37:01.016]  Let's go to
[00:37:03.161 --> 00:37:12.305]  Jeff, and we're not going to give Jeff's last name unless he chooses, as calmly as you can, tell us when this happened, what happened.
[00:37:12.305 --> 00:37:13.865]  Are you there, Jeff?
[00:37:13.865 --> 00:37:15.346]  Yes, I'm right here.
[00:37:15.346 --> 00:37:23.829]  Okay, you've got the floor, tell us, tell us, you're in Texas, we'll leave it at that, and just tell us a little bit of details, tell us exactly what happened.
[00:37:23.829 --> 00:37:29.572]  Well, I'm an Obama College student and also an interim pastor at a small church in Mount Vernon, Texas.
[00:37:31.129 --> 00:37:54.078]  At the school I go to, I work in the advising office, and one day, last, it was at the end of September, first of October, right before I took this church I'm at, we had a group of Boy Scouts come by, and part of my duty in the advising office is to give tests and PR-type things.
[00:37:54.078 --> 00:37:59.620]  And so, anyways, they came by, and I was assigned to take them around campus and talk to them
[00:38:01.049 --> 00:38:13.476]  How are we applying Americanism and patriotism and teaching and taking those kinds of things further in higher education, essentially, is what it boils down to.
[00:38:13.476 --> 00:38:22.761]  And so, I was taking them around campus, showing them different things, showing them different monuments and statutes where, you know, people are on campus.
[00:38:22.761 --> 00:38:26.263]  And so, I was sitting down with them outside at a gazebo.
[00:38:29.255 --> 00:38:39.143]  I sat there and I told him, I said, boys, it's going to be you who is going to take this country and to either make or break it.
[00:38:39.143 --> 00:38:47.390]  You need to get back to your Constitution, you need to get to know your Bill of Rights, and you need to stand up for them, because we're fast losing them.
[00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:52.054]  And it's going to be your generation, as well as ours, but yours is really going to get the bun of it.
[00:38:53.283 --> 00:38:55.664]  And, uh, well, so we continue our tour.
[00:38:55.664 --> 00:39:16.948]  Well, the next day, I got called in to... I want to stop you because, and again, I appreciate your courage, I've gotten hundreds of documents, scores of videos, but the average pastor or the average, uh, uh, college student or professor is so scared when they get threatened by these men in black, and that's what happened to you, that, uh, they won't come on air.
[00:39:16.948 --> 00:39:22.889]  Now, let's be specific here about the land of the free, home of the brave, because I want to be specific.
[00:39:23.693 --> 00:39:27.256]  All you said was is that we're losing our Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:39:27.256 --> 00:39:28.837]  It's up to you to defend it.
[00:39:28.837 --> 00:39:35.062]  Can you be as specific about the thought crime you committed, exactly what you said to them?
[00:39:35.062 --> 00:39:45.610]  I mean, like you're talking to those same... Teleport yourself back to that gazebo as you're talking to these 10 and 12 and 13 year olds about their duty as an American.
[00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:48.332]  I mean, there doesn't get any more John Wayne than this.
[00:39:48.332 --> 00:39:51.294]  And then just go back to exactly what you said to them.
[00:39:52.236 --> 00:40:07.121]  Well, I told him, I said, boy, I was a Waybelow Scout, and my Scoutmaster told me, and taught us our Constitution, and it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have memorized a whole lot of it, and come to love it, and come to see it for the document it is.
[00:40:07.121 --> 00:40:13.763]  And I said, boy, it's up to you, because our government is fast losing, fast taking away our rights.
[00:40:13.763 --> 00:40:18.945]  And I said, and I encouraged him to, I mentioned the Patriot Act, and I said, you need to read, you need to study.
[00:40:20.236 --> 00:40:25.159]  And I said, boys, I said, under that, they're stripping us of what we know to be America.
[00:40:25.159 --> 00:40:37.186]  And I told him, I said, listen, what you need to do is you need to reorient yourself to the Constitution, because that is the very founding basis of our government.
[00:40:37.186 --> 00:40:39.647]  And it is the supreme law of the land.
[00:40:39.647 --> 00:40:43.390]  And without it, we cannot stand or fall.
[00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:48.933]  And I said, well, it's going to be up to you, boys, as you grow and as you learn and interpret the Constitution.
[00:40:49.602 --> 00:40:58.827]  It's gonna be you who can either take us down the road to tyranny and to abolish America, or to take us back to where we need to be.
[00:40:58.827 --> 00:41:03.649]  And that's basically what I told them that got me in trouble.
[00:41:03.649 --> 00:41:05.170]  Now, how long ago was this?
[00:41:07.248 --> 00:41:09.310]  In the September 1st of October.
[00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:15.614]  Okay, so it's taken you this long, and I guess to discuss it, you know, pray about it, think about it, to decide to go public.
[00:41:15.614 --> 00:41:17.195]  We'll talk about why you're doing that now.
[00:41:17.195 --> 00:41:23.259]  The next day is what scared me, and I'll be honest with everybody who's listening.
[00:41:23.259 --> 00:41:26.762]  I was a fence-sitter, really, until then.
[00:41:26.762 --> 00:41:33.807]  My friend Steve, who's on, he had shown me some movies and some things, and I had had my suspicions and my doubts.
[00:41:34.861 --> 00:41:47.848]  But the next day, when they called me into the office, the fourth floor of the main administrative building, you know, you get called up there, that's where the president and the provost and all that's at, and so it's pretty big business.
[00:41:47.848 --> 00:41:55.292]  And I got called up there, and then I thought, well, you know, I'm in trouble, they're gonna expel me from the school, or just all those kinds of things.
[00:41:55.292 --> 00:42:03.236]  And so I get up there, and I go into the president's office, and there's this man, he's wearing a black suit, black tie, white shirt, sunglasses,
[00:42:03.795 --> 00:42:09.698]  And there was another man dressed similarly, and he said, sir, did you say such and such?
[00:42:09.698 --> 00:42:16.781]  Did you tell this truth about the Boy Scouts, about the Constitution yesterday?
[00:42:16.781 --> 00:42:18.502]  And I said, well, yeah.
[00:42:18.502 --> 00:42:21.543]  And then he threw down a copy, a transcript of everything I was saying.
[00:42:21.543 --> 00:42:26.945]  He said, could you fill in the blanks here and fill in the blanks here?
[00:42:26.945 --> 00:42:29.587]  And that just, it sent me over the edge.
[00:42:29.587 --> 00:42:31.307]  And Alex, it scared me.
[00:42:31.307 --> 00:42:32.008]  It really did.
[00:42:35.237 --> 00:42:35.958]  I scared you.
[00:42:35.958 --> 00:42:39.160]  I mean, I'm not a tough guy, but I would have had to physically control myself.
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:42.744]  You were in the room with absolute enemies of the Republic.
[00:42:42.744 --> 00:42:45.166]  I mean, you were in the room with cancer.
[00:42:45.166 --> 00:42:48.408]  I asked him, I asked him, I said, well, sir, who are you from?
[00:42:48.408 --> 00:42:55.875]  And he told me, he said, you're committing acts of terror and espionage by telling these students what to do.
[00:42:55.875 --> 00:42:56.916]  He said, that's not your place.
[00:42:58.348 --> 00:43:00.270]  And I said, this is a college campus.
[00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:05.975]  I said, no sir, you don't... I said, you're on the one and I don't appreciate you telling me that, but...
[00:43:07.478 --> 00:43:10.099]  But after that, I just kind of shut up and took my beating, if you will.
[00:43:10.099 --> 00:43:11.920]  Okay, let's stop right there.
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:13.541]  I want everybody listening to understand.
[00:43:13.541 --> 00:43:14.421]  I have the video.
[00:43:14.421 --> 00:43:15.822]  I have the training manuals.
[00:43:15.822 --> 00:43:17.863]  I have the legislation.
[00:43:17.863 --> 00:43:18.443]  All of it.
[00:43:18.443 --> 00:43:21.224]  And I've given it all to you before it came out, years before.
[00:43:21.224 --> 00:43:22.845]  I'm saying that not to toot my horn.
[00:43:22.845 --> 00:43:24.206]  I'm totally freaked out.
[00:43:24.206 --> 00:43:25.566]  This is real.
[00:43:25.566 --> 00:43:28.628]  They are training to blow your head off, okay?
[00:43:28.628 --> 00:43:29.668]  With foreign troops.
[00:43:29.668 --> 00:43:31.189]  You can't make this up.
[00:43:31.189 --> 00:43:32.430]  It's so horrible.
[00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:33.350]  I want you to slowly
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:35.741]  I was, I walked into a conference room
[00:44:02.205 --> 00:44:08.028]  With some officials from the university, and there were two men.
[00:44:08.028 --> 00:44:14.371]  One was, as I said, he was dressed in all black, and he had on sunglasses.
[00:44:14.371 --> 00:44:15.431]  He wouldn't give his name.
[00:44:15.431 --> 00:44:18.453]  He didn't have any kind of real identity.
[00:44:18.453 --> 00:44:22.215]  In fact, I followed the movie, Men in Black.
[00:44:22.215 --> 00:44:24.496]  I thought, well, this is strange.
[00:44:24.496 --> 00:44:25.777]  And there was another man.
[00:44:25.777 --> 00:44:26.897]  He was dressed similarly.
[00:44:26.897 --> 00:44:30.419]  He had on a gray suit with a, I think it was a blue or red tie.
[00:44:31.562 --> 00:44:34.004]  Anyways, they were dressed.
[00:44:34.004 --> 00:44:49.174]  And I walked in and the man in the gray suit put down on the table, he put down a transcript of everything that I had said and that was said in that museum, in that scenario with those students, with those scouts.
[00:44:49.174 --> 00:44:54.438]  And for those of you listening, it's real.
[00:44:54.438 --> 00:44:59.501]  I'm not anybody who's got anything interested or vested or anything like that.
[00:44:59.501 --> 00:45:00.642]  I'm just a college student.
[00:45:01.366 --> 00:45:02.367]  Now, how did they get it?
[00:45:02.367 --> 00:45:05.710]  Did one of the Boy Scouts, was there anybody with them?
[00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:10.874]  Did they get it from a security camera, which they use to spy on the citizens of the gazebo?
[00:45:10.874 --> 00:45:13.436]  Did you find out where they got that transcript?
[00:45:26.383 --> 00:45:27.845]  No, I didn't.
[00:45:27.845 --> 00:45:38.875]  And to be quite honest, I'm scared to even start to work, because my thinking is if they got that much power, then where will it stop?
[00:45:38.875 --> 00:45:41.137]  If I start to pry, what will happen?
[00:45:41.137 --> 00:45:45.601]  Well, it's going to stop when you die of cancer, sir.
[00:45:45.601 --> 00:45:47.583]  They've implanted you in every one of us.
[00:45:47.583 --> 00:45:48.824]  It's taken the inoculations.
[00:45:48.824 --> 00:45:50.025]  These are eugenicists, and we're
[00:45:50.655 --> 00:45:53.656]  We're in a crisis people can't even imagine.
[00:45:53.656 --> 00:45:57.298]  It's so bad and so serious.
[00:45:57.298 --> 00:46:01.400]  By the way, I have all the documents on that for new listeners, and I've done shows, and we'll do more shows on it.
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:03.381]  If you didn't know about that, you need to find out.
[00:46:03.381 --> 00:46:12.645]  For cops listening right now, when your mama, when your kids, when your wife, when your husband's dying, you know, when one in two of us has got it, it's one in three now, maybe then you'll listen!
[00:46:12.645 --> 00:46:15.327]  But let me just go back here to everybody.
[00:46:16.644 --> 00:46:26.508]  Now, you said you sat there... There was a scoutmaster that was with him.
[00:46:26.508 --> 00:46:28.469]  He had a military crew cut.
[00:46:28.469 --> 00:46:30.349]  He looked like a Marine.
[00:46:30.349 --> 00:46:32.030]  He really did.
[00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:36.632]  I don't know if that or the cameras could have picked up something.
[00:46:37.745 --> 00:46:39.868]  It was in a pretty populated area.
[00:46:39.868 --> 00:46:42.631]  You can hear a lot that goes on at that spot.
[00:46:55.368 --> 00:46:57.829]  Well, the guy in black, he acted like he was pretty much in charge.
[00:46:57.829 --> 00:47:05.774]  The guy in gray was kind of his mouthpiece, but every now and then he'd speak up and when he spoke it was like, I don't mean to be sacrilegious, but it was like God speaking.
[00:47:23.789 --> 00:47:27.732]  And what they basically told me was this.
[00:47:27.732 --> 00:47:38.920]  They said, listen, if you say anything, do anything, continue to do these kinds of things, we can have your head on a silver platter and the university's head on a silver platter.
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:42.103]  And all the programs and things that they've got going on.
[00:47:42.103 --> 00:47:43.904]  And I believe them.
[00:47:47.802 --> 00:48:06.288]  Oh, don't worry, they're not going to let go of that college with all those millions of minds they're going to get to put in black uniforms and think they're, quote, defending Jesus, putting people in FEMA camps, you know, because we're of the devil and secretly working with Al-Qaeda, fighting the precious, you know, Israelis.
[00:48:06.288 --> 00:48:08.809]  I mean, that's basically the brainwashing mode that's going on.
[00:48:08.809 --> 00:48:14.851]  They have different nodules, different modes, packages for different colleges, different mindsets.
[00:48:14.851 --> 00:48:16.872]  Every major college is now a factory of evil.
[00:48:17.632 --> 00:48:18.152]  He was.
[00:48:18.152 --> 00:48:20.894]  I've never seen him that nervous.
[00:48:20.894 --> 00:48:22.154]  And he's a pretty steady man.
[00:48:22.154 --> 00:48:22.855]  He's an ex-Marine, ex-Navy.
[00:48:41.553 --> 00:48:49.479]  You know, he's a military veteran, served in Vietnam, and I never, never seen him to be, to be like he was.
[00:48:49.479 --> 00:48:52.721]  And I knew he was, he appeared very much agitated.
[00:48:52.721 --> 00:48:59.686]  Well, that's because our colleges are already under infrastructure, quote, protection, which means they're already locked down prisons.
[00:48:59.686 --> 00:49:03.208]  And I guarantee you, he knew he was seeing the end of the country.
[00:49:03.208 --> 00:49:04.829]  And that's why he was agitated.
[00:49:04.829 --> 00:49:06.250]  I don't think he saw fear.
[00:49:06.250 --> 00:49:07.151]  I think he realizes
[00:49:08.044 --> 00:49:09.385]  Go ahead.
[00:49:09.385 --> 00:49:16.732]  Our university is also, we just are completing the finalization process for our re-accreditation.
[00:49:16.732 --> 00:49:21.356]  And, you know, I'm sure they can mess with that, too.
[00:49:21.356 --> 00:49:25.339]  You know, whatever.
[00:49:25.339 --> 00:49:26.700]  It's scary.
[00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:27.781]  It's scary, Mr. Jones.
[00:49:27.781 --> 00:49:29.062]  Well, that's like Head Start.
[00:49:29.062 --> 00:49:31.865]  Bush is federalizing all the local schools now.
[00:49:31.865 --> 00:49:33.906]  This is all excuses to take control.
[00:49:36.983 --> 00:49:38.465]  I mean, how long did this go on?
[00:49:38.465 --> 00:49:42.929]  As I told you, we could quote, have your head on a silver platter.
[00:49:42.929 --> 00:49:46.572]  It lasted about 20 minutes, 15, 20 minutes.
[00:49:46.572 --> 00:49:48.374]  This is absolutely key.
[00:49:48.374 --> 00:49:50.176]  You've got to go buy one of those little cheap...
[00:49:51.388 --> 00:49:53.149]  Uh, you know, 20, 30 bucks at Best Buy.
[00:49:53.149 --> 00:49:56.752]  Audio recorders get good with it, so you don't fumble.
[00:49:56.752 --> 00:50:02.855]  And then next time they walk up on you, or next time, uh, you know, they're criminals, so they like to sneak up.
[00:50:02.855 --> 00:50:07.838]  You just have it in your pocket and just hit record, uh, so you can get the enemy's operation on tape.
[00:50:07.838 --> 00:50:08.559]  And we're gonna get it.
[00:50:08.559 --> 00:50:09.779]  We're gonna get ya!
[00:50:09.779 --> 00:50:10.740]  We're gonna win!
[00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:14.102]  You may be able to get me, you bastards, but you're not gonna get the country!
[00:50:14.102 --> 00:50:14.982]  You're going down!
[00:50:14.982 --> 00:50:16.723]  I want them to know that.
[00:50:16.723 --> 00:50:17.524]  I mean, what was this?
[00:50:18.244 --> 00:50:22.009]  You know, your friend Steve's been telling you about this, and I'm sorry I'm so angry, Jeff.
[00:50:22.009 --> 00:50:24.011]  It just... They've ruined my life.
[00:50:24.011 --> 00:50:26.013]  They've ruined my country.
[00:50:26.013 --> 00:50:26.533]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:50:26.533 --> 00:50:29.196]  I mean, what was it like for you when you realized it was all true?
[00:50:29.196 --> 00:50:39.247]  Mr. Jones, for all those who are sitting on the sound of this voice, it brought home a lot of things that I had suspected.
[00:50:41.472 --> 00:50:45.879]  I went to my room and I broke down in tears because that's it.
[00:50:45.879 --> 00:50:47.562]  Our country's gone.
[00:50:47.562 --> 00:50:47.982]  Stay there.
[00:50:47.982 --> 00:50:48.483]  Stay there, sir.
[00:50:48.483 --> 00:50:49.364]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:49.364 --> 00:50:50.226]  We'll also talk to Steve.

[00:51:55.363 --> 00:52:02.688]  Another untold story, here it comes Another untold story, here it comes
[00:52:04.281 --> 00:52:11.868]  There is much untold story of the true story of America, such as the fact that Columbus did not discover America.
[00:52:21.741 --> 00:52:26.084]  Such as, Viking Leif Erikson was here long before Columbus.
[00:52:26.084 --> 00:52:37.133]  Such as, there were actually Christians living here a thousand years before Columbus, according to the archaeological record revealed in the book, Christians Before Columbus.
[00:52:37.133 --> 00:52:42.217]  Such as, the name America, what the word America itself means.
[00:52:42.217 --> 00:52:47.321]  Amir or Amil means heaven, and Rike or Rike means kingdom or dominion.
[00:52:47.321 --> 00:52:49.743]  Thus, America means heavenly kingdom.
[00:52:50.780 --> 00:53:05.992]  Of the 31,173 verses in the Bible, there was one verse used as a launching verse by those white Christian Europeans called Pilgrims before they came to America in the 1600s.
[00:53:05.992 --> 00:53:19.483]  Do you know what that verse was and why it, of all the 31,173 verses, was used, and the significance of its use concerning the beginning of what we now call the nation
[00:53:20.263 --> 00:53:22.124]  of America.
[00:53:22.124 --> 00:53:26.765]  It's an untold story told at AnotherUntoldStory.com.
[00:53:26.765 --> 00:53:29.446]  It's quite a story told nowhere else.
[00:53:29.446 --> 00:53:34.207]  Go there because it's only posted there for a short period of time.

[00:53:58.265 --> 00:54:00.587]  Bondage was hard fought.
[00:54:00.587 --> 00:54:03.749]  You know why they called it Old Glory?
[00:54:03.749 --> 00:54:11.936]  Because fighting five to one on average for eight years, we kicked the greatest military in the world's butt that had never been beaten.
[00:54:11.936 --> 00:54:13.797]  They were called the Invincibles.
[00:54:13.797 --> 00:54:14.558]  We beat them again in 1812.
[00:54:16.522 --> 00:54:20.384]  With old Hickory.
[00:54:20.384 --> 00:54:23.285]  Beat the Germans, the Japanese, everybody.
[00:54:23.285 --> 00:54:26.267]  And we did have liberty and freedom to some extent.
[00:54:26.267 --> 00:54:28.548]  And a man held his head high.
[00:54:28.548 --> 00:54:32.009]  You had free speech in this country.
[00:54:32.009 --> 00:54:33.430]  And now, look at it.
[00:54:33.430 --> 00:54:35.131]  Secret police everywhere.
[00:54:35.131 --> 00:54:36.091]  FEMA camps built.
[00:54:36.091 --> 00:54:37.712]  They're poisoning the water.
[00:54:37.712 --> 00:54:39.873]  Spraying you overhead.
[00:54:39.873 --> 00:54:42.614]  They're very, very serious.
[00:54:42.614 --> 00:54:44.535]  You understand, there's secret police everywhere.
[00:54:46.368 --> 00:54:49.170]  Now, if you give in to them, they win.
[00:54:49.170 --> 00:54:50.251]  You see, that's how this works.
[00:54:50.251 --> 00:54:54.613]  They've got to quietly take over all the infrastructure, and then get everybody ready for the next phase.
[00:54:54.613 --> 00:54:57.495]  And that's taking your bank accounts, everything.
[00:54:57.495 --> 00:55:04.220]  Then the yuppies are going to scream bloody murder and say, we'll do whatever you say, as long as you give us milk and honey back.
[00:55:04.220 --> 00:55:05.901]  As long as you give us bread and circuits.
[00:55:05.901 --> 00:55:09.443]  And then they're going to say, okay, you do this.
[00:55:09.443 --> 00:55:11.745]  Now, uh, it's in law now.
[00:55:11.745 --> 00:55:13.486]  It's totally unconstitutional and a fraud.
[00:55:14.264 --> 00:55:20.309]  Well, Bush can't declare himself emperor, Hillary can't, neither can Obama or McCain, that he is a dictator.
[00:55:20.309 --> 00:55:23.972]  Congress can't even see the Continuity of Government plans.
[00:55:23.972 --> 00:55:27.735]  But the cover letter says he's a dictator, and they said you can't see any more.
[00:55:27.735 --> 00:55:37.943]  Now, going back to Jeff, who's at one of the biggest Bible colleges in the country, one of the biggest in Texas, and I want to bring Steve up, your friend.
[00:55:39.153 --> 00:55:41.194]  But who got you to come on air?
[00:55:41.194 --> 00:55:44.856]  I will tell you this, you were a little timid coming on.
[00:55:44.856 --> 00:55:55.340]  You said, well, I don't want to, and I believe you did it for the reasons you said, you don't want to, quote, hurt the outreach and, quote, the good work, you said, like how you guys do outreach overseas and in Communist China and places.
[00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:59.902]  The point is, if we're Communist China or Nazi America, it won't matter.
[00:55:59.902 --> 00:56:08.006]  And does this fit in now with the pieces of the puzzle of how the preachers have been covertly hired by the government and the rest of it, Jeff?
[00:56:09.225 --> 00:56:10.325]  Yes, it does.
[00:56:10.325 --> 00:56:23.510]  And I've heard reports, and I know pastors within my association, the Rehabilitation Association, that have been approached by and have seen and have been given documents like you talk about.
[00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:24.750]  It's real.
[00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:29.792]  And it scares me, Mr. Jones, and to all those who are listening.
[00:56:29.792 --> 00:56:36.974]  I'll just be honest with you, you may not believe it, and you may want to cry, and you may want to do whatever you want to do, but it's real.
[00:56:37.935 --> 00:56:39.797]  They don't care who they go after anymore.
[00:56:39.797 --> 00:56:44.281]  As long as they get their power and have complete control like it is in communist times.
[00:56:59.194 --> 00:57:00.555]  It's an irony.
[00:57:00.555 --> 00:57:03.796]  But you know, Mr. Jones, and all that Brother Barber speak, but I just would like to say this.
[00:57:03.796 --> 00:57:06.137]  There's a lot of good people, innocent people getting hurt by it.
[00:57:28.496 --> 00:57:39.940]  And we as patriots, there's going to be some of us who are going to have to stand up and fight, but there's going to be others of us who are going to have to be out there on the battlefield afterwards, dressing the wounds and healing the families.
[00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:45.942]  And that's my concern, Mr. Jones, especially after seeing that.
[00:57:45.942 --> 00:57:57.586]  And that's one reason for my timidity in quote-unquote going public or coming on this and talking to you about it, because I do want to see those and I want to help them.
[00:57:58.952 --> 00:58:01.713]  No, they didn't.
[00:58:01.713 --> 00:58:15.597]  Well, they did mention DHS and one of the officials had mentioned to me afterwards that FBI was involved.
[00:58:15.597 --> 00:58:20.278]  Somehow there was a state trooper that was on the door watching the door making sure nobody got out.
[00:58:21.903 --> 00:58:24.145]  Yeah, well, remember, remember, don't use their words.
[00:58:24.145 --> 00:58:28.408]  It's a federal trooper, charted in 1936 in the US.
[00:58:28.408 --> 00:58:30.169]  It's all federal.
[00:58:30.169 --> 00:58:30.809]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:30.809 --> 00:58:36.233]  Stay there.
[00:58:36.233 --> 00:58:38.735]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:44.559 --> 00:58:45.860]  It is a big idea.
[00:58:47.020 --> 00:58:48.760]  A New World Order.
[00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:53.661]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:58:53.661 --> 00:58:56.502]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:58:56.502 --> 00:58:59.283]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:58:59.283 --> 00:59:02.463]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:59:02.463 --> 00:59:09.785]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:59:12.830 --> 00:59:18.252]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:59:18.252 --> 00:59:21.553]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:59:21.553 --> 00:59:24.694]  The Oval Party is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:59:24.694 --> 00:59:25.855]  Most people have no idea.
[00:59:25.855 --> 00:59:26.655]  They're not after money.
[00:59:26.655 --> 00:59:27.916]  They have all the money they need.
[00:59:27.916 --> 00:59:28.496]  They're after power.
[00:59:28.496 --> 00:59:30.056]  That's what they're after these years.

[00:59:39.544 --> 00:59:41.567]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:59:41.567 --> 00:59:46.734]  You have been warned.
[00:59:46.734 --> 00:59:49.117]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:49.117 --> 00:59:51.880]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:59:58.789 --> 01:00:00.530]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:02.111]  You want answers?
[01:00:02.111 --> 01:00:03.032]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:03.032 --> 01:00:07.874]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:07.874 --> 01:00:13.277]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:13.277 --> 01:00:19.221]  You gotta love it, men in black suits, swaggering around in black sunglasses with the state police backing them up.
[01:00:19.221 --> 01:00:22.463]  I don't tell you who I am, boy, I tell you what to do!
[01:00:22.463 --> 01:00:25.985]  You don't talk about that Bill of Rights and Constitution ever again.
[01:00:27.048 --> 01:00:30.430]  I will shut down this school so fast it'll make your head spin.
[01:00:30.430 --> 01:00:32.491]  How's that sound like land of the free, home of the brave?
[01:00:32.491 --> 01:00:33.671]  You like that?
[01:00:33.671 --> 01:00:36.493]  We're fighting for freedom!
[01:00:36.493 --> 01:00:45.638]  Fighting to have amnesty and open borders, and fighting to give the illegal aliens federal tuition, and fighting to make you a slave, boy!
[01:00:45.638 --> 01:00:48.379]  Jeff, I want to stay in contact with you.
[01:00:48.379 --> 01:00:52.161]  I told you this beforehand, there's a good chance, and I told Steve this, Steve Barber,
[01:00:53.732 --> 01:00:56.436]  That's pretty obvious where the school is, and you know, you said it.
[01:00:56.436 --> 01:01:05.670]  I said go as far as you want, and let me just tell you, you'll probably now get a visit from them of more threats and more intimidation.
[01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:08.535]  I said go as far as you wanted, but you listed the town, where it's at.
[01:01:10.062 --> 01:01:17.608]  Uh, they did go to adult pastors of major churches and tell them to shut up and how dare you release those documents, but then nothing happened.
[01:01:17.608 --> 01:01:21.211]  Uh, I mean, do you want to go all the way?
[01:01:21.211 --> 01:01:25.114]  Or, let me just tell you, you did go all the way.
[01:01:25.114 --> 01:01:30.519]  Well, uh, no sir, that's as far as I'm comfortable.
[01:01:30.519 --> 01:01:35.403]  And Alex, I know I'm a little tentative on this, but it's a great struggle.
[01:01:36.405 --> 01:01:37.986]  It's a great struggle, personally.
[01:01:37.986 --> 01:01:41.387]  You just don't know how much... No, I know.
[01:01:41.387 --> 01:01:42.368]  You've been going to school.
[01:01:42.368 --> 01:01:44.249]  You're already a pastor.
[01:01:44.249 --> 01:01:50.132]  You want to help people, and you just... Why should you have to have men in black telling you don't talk about the Constitution?
[01:01:50.132 --> 01:01:50.872]  It's insane!
[01:01:50.872 --> 01:01:56.195]  I know, and it's unreal.
[01:01:56.195 --> 01:01:58.056]  So, you were just so flabbergasted.
[01:01:58.056 --> 01:02:00.617]  You never said, why are you doing this?
[01:02:00.617 --> 01:02:01.697]  This is crazy.
[01:02:01.697 --> 01:02:02.378]  I have a right.
[01:02:02.378 --> 01:02:05.119]  You just were just... They were just... They were just there?
[01:02:06.033 --> 01:02:11.938]  I did say, I did say when they approached me with it and asked me to fill in the blanks, I said, that was yesterday, I can't remember.
[01:02:11.938 --> 01:02:14.019]  I said, plus it's none of your business.
[01:02:14.019 --> 01:02:17.282]  I'm not speaking anything that's unrealistic.
[01:02:17.282 --> 01:02:21.906]  And then they, that's when they threatened the university and threatened everything else.
[01:02:21.906 --> 01:02:26.590]  And, and, um, just that's, that was it.
[01:02:26.590 --> 01:02:27.270]  That was the end of that.
[01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:30.773]  And that's, that's when I shut up and said, well, okay, you've got the power.
[01:02:31.804 --> 01:02:34.646]  I'm just going to stand here because I was in a no-win situation.
[01:02:34.646 --> 01:02:37.849]  I mean, I kept my mouth open or I kept it closed.
[01:02:37.849 --> 01:02:39.270]  I was just in a no-win situation.
[01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:43.774]  No, you have incredible courage and I appreciate you and I appreciate what you've done.
[01:02:43.774 --> 01:02:44.795]  I want to bring your friend up.
[01:02:44.795 --> 01:02:46.837]  I know you've got your pastor in the church today.
[01:02:46.837 --> 01:02:48.918]  You've got to get in there and take care of things.
[01:02:48.918 --> 01:02:52.962]  You've got to get out of the office and take care of that with your other duties.
[01:02:52.962 --> 01:02:56.765]  Not just going to school, but you're filling in for the pastor today at your local church.
[01:02:56.765 --> 01:02:57.806]  I want to bring Steve up.
[01:02:58.587 --> 01:03:04.314]  Steve Barber, what was it like when you've been telling your friend this for years and then suddenly it happened in your town?
[01:03:05.402 --> 01:03:08.044]  Well, you know, Alex, it didn't surprise me one bit.
[01:03:08.044 --> 01:03:19.734]  You know, back on September 11, 2001, I've been educating myself for years about this stuff through the John Birch Society, through TechSmars, and through others, and then, of course, through you.
[01:03:19.734 --> 01:03:24.839]  And I really appreciate y'all's efforts and how you are trying to make people aware of what's going on.
[01:03:24.839 --> 01:03:26.600]  But on September 11, 2001, when I saw what happened,
[01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:37.607]  Instinctively, immediately what came to my mind was, uh-huh, so this is how they're going to bring out about martial law in this country.
[01:03:37.607 --> 01:03:48.235]  And I remember calling a radio show here in my local area, talking to this guy John Matthews is no longer on the air, and telling him about what's going on in the aftermath of 9-11.
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:51.942]  And saying, this is going to lead to martial law.
[01:03:51.942 --> 01:03:54.224]  And he said, no, our Constitution protects us.
[01:03:54.224 --> 01:03:57.087]  And I said, you don't understand how much of that's already gone.
[01:03:57.087 --> 01:04:00.730]  He said, Steve, go in the backyard and watch for black helicopters.
[01:04:00.730 --> 01:04:01.851]  And he hung up on me.
[01:04:01.851 --> 01:04:07.496]  However, a year later, he was on the same show talking to a guy that was an expert in dealing with the government.
[01:04:07.956 --> 01:04:10.697]  Talking about the Patriot Act, and he said, have you read this?
[01:04:10.697 --> 01:04:12.457]  This scares me to death!
[01:04:12.457 --> 01:04:13.837]  They're going to take away our liberties!
[01:04:13.837 --> 01:04:15.037]  And I said, uh-huh!
[01:04:15.037 --> 01:04:17.938]  Now you're seeing what I was trying to tell you!
[01:04:17.938 --> 01:04:18.398]  Stay there!
[01:04:18.398 --> 01:04:18.738]  Stay there!
[01:04:18.738 --> 01:04:22.399]  I want to do two more minutes, because he's got to go in and pastor with Jeff.
[01:04:22.399 --> 01:04:31.200]  Jeff, quick break, come back in two minutes, say bye to you, and I'm going to continue with Steve Barber, your friend, who spurred you to go public.
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:35.241]  One of the largest Bible schools in Texas, ladies and gentlemen, and
[01:04:36.664 --> 01:04:45.092]  Guys in black from Homeland Security show up, the state police, FBI, and then they say, boy, you don't talk about that terrorist document.
[01:04:45.092 --> 01:04:46.293]  We'll be right back.

[01:05:19.403 --> 01:05:21.164]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.

[01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:06.262]  Washington You're Fired is a new patriotic documentary from the director of Beyond Treason.
[01:06:06.262 --> 01:06:10.804]  The video is the result of a two-year endeavor to assemble a video tool for engaging
[01:06:11.164 --> 01:06:15.645]  Educating and motivating the American people to climb back into the driver's seat of Congress.
[01:06:15.645 --> 01:06:23.667]  Washington You're Fired lays out the last seven years of fundamentally flawed terror-related spy bills in a linear fashion that no one has ever constructed before.
[01:06:23.667 --> 01:06:28.468]  The resulting shift in our governmental power structure leaves the American people with only two choices.
[01:06:28.468 --> 01:06:31.389]  Be a part of the problem or be a part of the solution.

[01:07:52.597 --> 01:07:59.241]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:59.241 --> 01:08:02.223]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:05.254 --> 01:08:11.401]  Our military, under the control of private intelligence agencies, has overthrown more than a hundred countries.
[01:08:11.401 --> 01:08:12.963]  They've just done it here.
[01:08:12.963 --> 01:08:21.073]  You see, I knew in the late 90s when I interviewed the police chief of San Antonio, they tried to bribe and pay off for covert ops in preparation for martial law.
[01:08:21.073 --> 01:08:23.876]  I knew when I interviewed Thomas Sanchez, Vietnam veteran.
[01:08:24.705 --> 01:08:26.086]  He was an intelligence.
[01:08:26.086 --> 01:08:29.408]  He was approached by the Army to prepare the public for martial law.
[01:08:29.408 --> 01:08:31.710]  We didn't know if martial law was coming, when it was coming.
[01:08:31.710 --> 01:08:39.295]  We just knew, man, there's this huge program in every county and every city to do this, and now it's just massive.
[01:08:39.295 --> 01:08:48.502]  And we said from government documents we got that they would use staged terror as the pretext to really build it up and then use it on us.
[01:08:48.502 --> 01:08:49.162]  And they're doing it.
[01:08:49.162 --> 01:08:50.483]  And it's, again, it's about
[01:08:51.169 --> 01:08:52.409]  Bankrupting the economy.
[01:08:52.409 --> 01:08:54.330]  It's about taking your private property rights.
[01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:56.650]  It's about taking your farms and ranches.
[01:08:56.650 --> 01:08:59.071]  They can do that under tyranny.
[01:08:59.071 --> 01:09:00.651]  So many of you think you're part of the system.
[01:09:00.651 --> 01:09:02.972]  Going back to Jeff.
[01:09:02.972 --> 01:09:07.953]  Jeff, you're there at a major Bible college in East Texas, there in Mount Vernon.
[01:09:07.953 --> 01:09:09.733]  You've given out a lot of the info.
[01:09:09.733 --> 01:09:10.893]  We commend your courage.
[01:09:10.893 --> 01:09:14.154]  I want you to know, and I want them to know, when they listen to this interview,
[01:09:14.989 --> 01:09:19.632]  That, you know, you're good at picking on young men who are the salt of the earth.
[01:09:19.632 --> 01:09:23.574]  You're good at shoving around directors of colleges.
[01:09:23.574 --> 01:09:24.194]  I don't sit here.
[01:09:24.194 --> 01:09:25.055]  I know you're killers.
[01:09:25.055 --> 01:09:27.136]  I know you're mad dog drug dealers.
[01:09:27.136 --> 01:09:29.117]  I know you're mad dog killers.
[01:09:29.117 --> 01:09:33.879]  I know you're a criminal enterprise and this is your time to take over and you're going to get yours.
[01:09:33.879 --> 01:09:36.441]  But I want you to know that in the end, you're going to be brought to justice.
[01:09:37.293 --> 01:09:40.014]  And I want you to know that I'm not afraid of you.
[01:09:40.014 --> 01:09:40.995]  And I do believe in God.
[01:09:40.995 --> 01:09:50.060]  You may be a bunch of atheists that don't believe in God and you think, you know, this is your one life and you're going to screw everybody and get whatever you can, but you're going to fail in the end and you're going to be the bad guys.
[01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:58.044]  And there's going to be Nuremberg trials and it's not going to be thousands, it's going to be tens of thousands of you that are going to get due process and going to get jury trials.
[01:09:58.704 --> 01:10:08.769]  And then for the type of terrorism, and that's terrorism to call a young man in and threaten to quote cut his head off and ruin his life if he doesn't shut up and not have a First Amendment.
[01:10:08.769 --> 01:10:16.993]  So I want you to know, Jeff, that we're here to back you up and I need to give you my cell phone number, my home number, I forgot to do that.
[01:10:16.993 --> 01:10:20.054]  I'm gonna keep Steve on with us, I'll give all that to him.
[01:10:20.054 --> 01:10:22.835]  Call me, call the network, call Genesis.
[01:10:22.835 --> 01:10:26.497]  If anything happens to you, the next 48 hours will be the key time
[01:10:27.297 --> 01:10:29.038]  Well, you know Alex, I love this country.
[01:10:29.038 --> 01:10:31.639]  And for all those who are listening, it's going to take us.
[01:10:31.639 --> 01:10:33.679]  And there's going to be a lot of people who are going to get hurt.
[01:10:33.679 --> 01:10:38.281]  And we've just got to remember to stand firm, like you've talked about.
[01:10:57.693 --> 01:11:09.001]  It takes a lot, and when it happens to you, if it does happen to you, and it will, I'll tell you from my own personal experience, it's going to be a great struggle for you to do what's right.
[01:11:09.608 --> 01:11:13.410]  But it's been very liberating talking with you, Mr. Jones.
[01:11:13.410 --> 01:11:13.910]  It is.
[01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:15.710]  Let me tell you, you've now committed.
[01:11:15.710 --> 01:11:17.651]  You've now done one of the most important things in your life.
[01:11:17.651 --> 01:11:18.652]  You stood up to them then.
[01:11:18.652 --> 01:11:21.693]  You know, you told those young men the truth.
[01:11:21.693 --> 01:11:29.056]  And our young men wouldn't be drug addicts, they wouldn't be lazy if the fathers and the male mentors were like the people that built this country.
[01:11:29.056 --> 01:11:30.836]  You've got to give young men a mission.
[01:11:30.836 --> 01:11:36.819]  You've got to explain to them that they're part of a great cause, a cause of liberty, and then they'll grow up straight and strong.
[01:11:37.399 --> 01:11:39.323]  But see, they've taken that away from our young men.
[01:11:39.323 --> 01:11:43.010]  You were trying to give that back to them, and that scared the enemy.
[01:11:43.010 --> 01:11:46.717]  They're scared of you, and they're scared of the Spirit of the Lord that lives in your heart.
[01:11:46.717 --> 01:11:47.198]  Anything else?
[01:11:48.650 --> 01:11:56.152]  I appreciate you, Alex, and it's going to take every one of us to do our individual part to bring this country back to where it needs to be.
[01:11:56.152 --> 01:12:04.694]  Let me tell you, you've crossed a Rubicon, and you're now in a bigger world, and you've now committed, but you said it was liberating.
[01:12:04.694 --> 01:12:06.374]  Do you feel the freedom now?
[01:12:06.374 --> 01:12:08.235]  I mean, do you feel like things just got bigger?
[01:12:08.235 --> 01:12:10.896]  You didn't get bigger, but like you're more in touch with the world?
[01:12:10.896 --> 01:12:15.297]  I mean, did you just feel that expansion when you stepped up to the plate against evil?
[01:12:15.297 --> 01:12:16.157]  I mean, real evil?
[01:12:17.893 --> 01:12:24.420]  I do, and I feel like I'm ready to preach, and I feel like my preaching is going to be more powerful than what it has been.
[01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:25.861]  Yes, yes.
[01:12:25.861 --> 01:12:26.502]  God bless you.
[01:12:26.502 --> 01:12:27.623]  We appreciate you, Jeff.
[01:12:27.623 --> 01:12:28.864]  You bring tears.
[01:12:28.864 --> 01:12:29.505]  Take care.
[01:12:29.505 --> 01:12:30.325]  God bless you.
[01:12:30.325 --> 01:12:31.407]  We're there with you, my friend.
[01:12:31.407 --> 01:12:33.449]  Everybody should pray for Jeff.
[01:12:33.449 --> 01:12:36.592]  Steve, you're on with us now.
[01:12:36.592 --> 01:12:37.413]  You've got the floor.
[01:12:37.413 --> 01:12:39.174]  Anything you want to say about this case?
[01:12:39.174 --> 01:12:41.837]  What it was like when your friend first told you this had happened?
[01:12:42.819 --> 01:12:48.791]  Yeah, well, like I said, I wasn't a bit surprised, and right now I'm a mixed bag of emotions.
[01:12:48.791 --> 01:12:51.476]  I mean, my heart feels like it's going to bust out of my chest.
[01:12:52.679 --> 01:12:58.303]  You know, people are always telling me, you need to calm down, you know, you shouldn't be so driven by this.
[01:12:58.303 --> 01:13:00.044]  But I'm like you, Alex.
[01:13:00.044 --> 01:13:02.265]  I see what's going on.
[01:13:02.265 --> 01:13:10.210]  And when Jeff shared this with me, the first thing I thought of was, man, you need to get on Alex's show, because I know he'll jump all over this.
[01:13:10.210 --> 01:13:16.714]  Because here's the thing, I've talked to guys in my church, older men that actually went to this same college years ago,
[01:13:17.495 --> 01:13:18.516]  Well, it's a built-in cowardice.
[01:13:18.516 --> 01:13:22.961]  They decided to make a joke out of it because they're upset deep down instead of being a man and letting the anger flow.
[01:13:36.975 --> 01:13:41.717]  Yeah, and also because this is the main thing that we're encountering and you know it.
[01:13:41.717 --> 01:13:44.358]  People are not living in reality.
[01:13:44.358 --> 01:13:51.580]  People are being pleasantly distracted by all this junk like Anna Nicole Smith and OJ Simpson and all this other junk.
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:14:04.706]  And when I'm trying to get across to people, look at folks, this didn't happen up in New York City where we've been hearing about these police brutalities, or over in Nazi Germany, or Stalinist Russia, or Mao's China.
[01:14:04.706 --> 01:14:06.747]  This is in East Texas.
[01:14:06.747 --> 01:14:10.869]  Good ol' boy, Bible Baptist, Bible Belt Texas, folks.
[01:14:10.869 --> 01:14:14.010]  This is close to home in our backyard.
[01:14:14.010 --> 01:14:18.172]  And Alex, listen, I've got a tract that I got years ago.
[01:14:18.172 --> 01:14:20.033]  It was a pro-life tract.
[01:14:20.613 --> 01:14:31.316]  And I just want to, real briefly, I want to read one part of this that was written talking to Christians about taking action against this hideous atrocity called abortion.
[01:14:31.316 --> 01:14:33.937]  But of course, see, this is just one piece of the puzzle.
[01:14:33.937 --> 01:14:38.298]  This guy says, I lived in Germany during the Nazi Holocaust.
[01:14:38.298 --> 01:14:40.098]  I considered myself a Christian.
[01:14:40.098 --> 01:14:42.919]  I attended church since I was a small boy.
[01:14:42.919 --> 01:14:48.901]  We had heard the stories of what was happening to the Jews, but the most, like most people in this country,
[01:14:49.421 --> 01:14:56.346]  We, which is the United States, he's saying, we tried to distance ourselves from the reality of what was really taking place.
[01:14:56.346 --> 01:14:58.147]  What could anyone do to stop it?
[01:14:58.147 --> 01:15:08.315]  And he mentioned in the church what they would do, the song director, when the cars, the cattle cars and the trains were going by with all these people, and they heard them screaming for help.
[01:15:08.755 --> 01:15:11.257]  They told him, sing louder!
[01:15:11.257 --> 01:15:12.959]  And see, this is the thing, Alex.
[01:15:12.959 --> 01:15:14.920]  I talked to my mother just a couple days ago.
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:17.062]  I was trying to tell her about this stuff.
[01:15:17.062 --> 01:15:18.183]  Oh, I don't believe that.
[01:15:18.183 --> 01:15:19.945]  George Bush is a Christian.
[01:15:19.945 --> 01:15:23.368]  And then she started going into a mode of singing praises to the Lord.
[01:15:23.368 --> 01:15:24.829]  And I'm all for that, but listen.
[01:15:25.249 --> 01:15:32.316]  Our Founding Fathers, I've told people this, like Nehemiah of old who had a trough in one hand and a sword in the other.
[01:15:32.316 --> 01:15:38.862]  Our Founding Fathers, when Paul Revere went riding through the night like he did shouting, Two arms!
[01:15:38.862 --> 01:15:39.423]  Two arms!
[01:15:39.423 --> 01:15:40.724]  The British are coming!
[01:15:40.724 --> 01:15:45.469]  Yes, they prayed and they trusted God as they were taking up their muskets.
[01:15:45.789 --> 01:15:54.497]  And they were able to turn back the enemy and do what we now know as the revolution because they were united, because they were aware of what's going on.
[01:15:54.497 --> 01:16:13.173]  And I am so sick and tired of Christians here in America who think that somehow, well, you know, we're just going to trust the Lord and He's going to protect us, but we do nothing other than saying that we believe, when the fact is that God expects something to be done on our part because
[01:16:13.573 --> 01:16:17.457]  I had a brother in the war, a well-meaning brother, told me this, Al.
[01:16:17.457 --> 01:16:21.582]  He said, I believe that the biggest idol here in America today is liberty.
[01:16:21.582 --> 01:16:22.323]  I disagree.
[01:16:22.323 --> 01:16:28.669]  I believe liberty is a precious, God-given commodity that we have a responsibility to guard.
[01:16:28.669 --> 01:16:29.370]  Well, let me stop you.
[01:16:29.370 --> 01:16:29.951]  Let me stop you.
[01:16:30.391 --> 01:16:41.299]  We've got hundreds of millions of people being brainwashed by their churches, telling them to lay down to evil, go along with this, and render unto Caesar, and submit, and being a slave is good, on and on and on.
[01:16:41.299 --> 01:16:43.320]  They know what they're doing.
[01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:45.882]  They understand what they're doing.
[01:16:45.882 --> 01:16:57.690]  And for those who just tuned in, secret police everywhere going in and threatening one of the student administrators who's about to graduate college.
[01:16:58.644 --> 01:17:01.945]  That you better not teach people about the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:17:01.945 --> 01:17:03.386]  That's terrorism.
[01:17:03.386 --> 01:17:06.807]  You could be arrested for terrorism, for your speech.
[01:17:06.807 --> 01:17:09.068]  I mean, this isn't our country.
[01:17:09.068 --> 01:17:12.129]  This is the opposite of that.
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:16.721]  And it shows you these are the bad guys.
[01:17:16.721 --> 01:17:18.142]  These are the bad men.
[01:17:18.142 --> 01:17:21.263]  These are the people who are bad.
[01:17:21.263 --> 01:17:23.124]  I mean, this was going on before 9-11.
[01:17:23.124 --> 01:17:30.707]  They were teaching the local police and others that, oh, if somebody's got a pocket Constitution, arrest them.
[01:17:30.707 --> 01:17:34.248]  I mean, how brainwashed are these cops that they think the Constitution's bad?
[01:17:34.924 --> 01:17:38.946]  Folks, I mean, do you have any idea how deep this has gotten?
[01:17:38.946 --> 01:17:44.028]  What was it like for your friend who you said had seen my films but didn't totally buy it?
[01:17:44.028 --> 01:17:46.829]  I mean, what did he say when Jeff called you, Steve?
[01:17:46.829 --> 01:17:47.489]  What did he say?
[01:17:47.489 --> 01:17:52.471]  I mean, did he call you that first day and say, oh my gosh, Homeland Security just came in and threatened me?
[01:17:53.214 --> 01:18:08.021]  Well, I actually was the one that called him just to say hi, and then, you know, I was talking to him about some of the things I've been hearing on your show recently, and I tried to listen on a daily basis, and he was saying, you know, as a matter of fact, and then he shared with me what happened last September.
[01:18:09.001 --> 01:18:16.748]  And the thing is, it wasn't that he wasn't a believer before, because when I showed him Terror Storm, his mouth was on the ground.
[01:18:16.748 --> 01:18:18.249]  He knew that this was real.
[01:18:18.249 --> 01:18:25.074]  But it's just that he needed to have something to spur him into finally putting feet to his faith and doing something.
[01:18:27.532 --> 01:18:30.494]  Like I said, I thought, man, Alex needs to know about this.
[01:18:30.494 --> 01:18:33.776]  I know he'll jump all over this because this hits real close to home.
[01:18:33.776 --> 01:18:37.498]  This is in the heart of America, and that's what they want to strike at.
[01:18:37.498 --> 01:18:45.062]  And Alex, I believe, I told Jeff this, I believe the reason that they want America as the prize is because this is
[01:18:45.502 --> 01:18:47.944]  And where there is gospel, there is liberty.
[01:18:47.944 --> 01:18:50.446]  But see, now they've already taken over the gospel.
[01:18:50.446 --> 01:18:56.511]  They have the preachers, the major denominations, working for them, just churning out evil.
[01:19:09.494 --> 01:19:16.538]  Folks, if your pastor is telling you to do what the government says, submit, they've been bought and paid for.
[01:19:16.538 --> 01:19:19.820]  You understand that's the opposite of what the Bible actually teaches.
[01:19:19.820 --> 01:19:21.902]  And I know we have a lot of people that aren't Christian, aren't religious.
[01:19:21.902 --> 01:19:23.022]  It doesn't matter.
[01:19:23.022 --> 01:19:25.964]  The enemy is taking over the churches.
[01:19:25.964 --> 01:19:27.665]  This is the main battleground.
[01:19:27.665 --> 01:19:30.407]  You better be aware of this.
[01:19:30.407 --> 01:19:34.209]  Well, I tell you, Steve, during the break I'm going to give you my cell phone, my home number.
[01:19:34.209 --> 01:19:35.630]  Be sure you give that to Jeff.
[01:19:36.390 --> 01:19:38.612]  Uh, this is very, very serious.
[01:19:38.612 --> 01:19:41.554]  Uh, we'll be right back, and I'm gonna get into a bunch of other issues.
[01:19:41.554 --> 01:19:44.796]  They wanna make the public school children wear anklet bracelets.
[01:19:44.796 --> 01:19:52.082]  That's right, the schools are nothing but preparation centers for prison.
[01:19:52.082 --> 01:19:54.563]  It is a big idea.
[01:19:54.563 --> 01:19:56.305]  A new world order.
[01:19:56.305 --> 01:20:00.588]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:20:01.309 --> 01:20:04.031]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:20:04.031 --> 01:20:06.813]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:20:06.813 --> 01:20:09.996]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:20:09.996 --> 01:20:20.344]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:20:20.344 --> 01:20:25.808]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:20:25.808 --> 01:20:29.211]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:20:29.651 --> 01:20:32.212]  Dillberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:20:32.212 --> 01:20:33.373]  Most people have no idea.
[01:20:33.373 --> 01:20:34.173]  They're not after money.
[01:20:34.173 --> 01:20:35.454]  They have all the money they need.
[01:20:35.454 --> 01:20:36.054]  They're after power.
[01:20:36.054 --> 01:20:37.574]  That's what they're after these years.

[01:20:49.099 --> 01:20:50.260]  You have been warned.
[01:20:51.149 --> 01:20:57.155]  Attention GCN listeners, would you like to watch uncensored, unregulated, even banned TV on your computer?

[01:21:18.337 --> 01:21:21.180]  And here's the best part, it's 100% legal.

[01:21:51.246 --> 01:21:53.207]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:21:53.207 --> 01:21:56.829]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:21:56.829 --> 01:21:59.190]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:21:59.190 --> 01:22:02.311]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:22:02.311 --> 01:22:08.054]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:22:08.054 --> 01:22:11.956]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:22:12.296 --> 01:22:17.498]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[01:22:17.498 --> 01:22:20.539]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[01:22:38.564 --> 01:22:40.025]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of
[01:22:53.677 --> 01:22:54.017]  I think so.
[01:23:17.725 --> 01:23:20.226]  Now Calbin soaps are available to you and me.

[01:23:26.389 --> 01:23:27.569]  No animal testing.

[01:23:28.910 --> 01:23:30.791]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[01:23:30.791 --> 01:23:32.211]  And I say big time.

[01:23:52.045 --> 01:23:58.930]  Going back to Steve Barber in Mount Vernon, Texas.
[01:24:03.661 --> 01:24:06.763]  The big East Texas Bible School, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:06.763 --> 01:24:14.226]  Say a big Bible School in Mount Vernon, it's already out, so we're not... The feds already know what they've done, they already monitor everything on the show.
[01:24:14.226 --> 01:24:19.188]  They're already fully aware of their operations, and this is going on everywhere.
[01:24:19.188 --> 01:24:24.751]  I mean, there's local preachers on TV in Austin saying, do what the government says when the time of tribulation cometh.
[01:24:25.505 --> 01:24:26.746]  Go to the camp!
[01:24:26.746 --> 01:24:27.947]  Oh, the Lord!
[01:24:27.947 --> 01:24:30.109]  It's so good to be a slave!
[01:24:30.109 --> 01:24:31.630]  We've played audio of this.
[01:24:31.630 --> 01:24:33.071]  It's insane.
[01:24:33.071 --> 01:24:33.852]  It got even worse.
[01:24:33.852 --> 01:24:37.375]  I was saying to Steve during the break, I said, is there anything else you want to add?
[01:24:37.375 --> 01:24:39.537]  And he said, well, Philip Bobbitt came to town.
[01:24:39.537 --> 01:24:44.621]  Now, remember on the cover of the Statesman a month ago, I made a big deal about it on there because it is a big deal.
[01:24:44.621 --> 01:24:46.743]  They showed a picture of the Constitution being burned.
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:57.405]  And then it said, fighting terrorism under it, and then it went on for two pages to say, getting rid of the Constitution, Bill of Rights and Freedom, is what we need to get rid of America.
[01:24:57.405 --> 01:24:58.446]  It said it!
[01:24:58.446 --> 01:25:00.287]  Said it!
[01:25:00.287 --> 01:25:07.311]  And that's who they have, the nephew of LBJ, top-level strategist, Philip Bobbitt, runs the whole U.T.C.I.A.
[01:25:07.311 --> 01:25:09.052]  recruiting program.
[01:25:09.052 --> 01:25:12.234]  Let's go ahead and go back to Steve.
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:16.301]  Mr. Bobbitt fluttered into town.
[01:25:16.301 --> 01:25:18.903]  Maybe he burned copies of the Constitution while he was there?
[01:25:18.903 --> 01:25:21.044]  I mean, did the police worship this?
[01:25:21.044 --> 01:25:22.525]  I mean, what was happening?
[01:25:22.525 --> 01:25:23.786]  See, this is the thing, Alex.
[01:25:23.786 --> 01:25:32.071]  The reason I wanted Jeff to get in touch is that he has experienced, just him himself, one person, a plethora of the issues you discuss on your show.
[01:25:32.071 --> 01:25:41.077]  He shared one, but he also shared with me about Bobbitt being invited to his college there by a professor of history, I believe it was, to speak
[01:25:41.537 --> 01:25:45.878]  Because he wanted to get an opposing view of what true Americanism was.
[01:25:45.878 --> 01:26:01.881]  And so anyway, when Bobbitt started exposing all his wacko views that are so counterproductive to what we know is right, he said that the professor basically interrupted him and told him that he was guilty of treason, and he was a traitor, and he should be tried as such.
[01:26:01.881 --> 01:26:06.622]  And my understanding was, I think they kicked him out, and he's not, of course, invited back there again.
[01:26:07.463 --> 01:26:12.850]  Uh, you know, but he was calling for dismantling the Constitution and that national sovereignty is bad.
[01:26:12.850 --> 01:26:16.514]  All the things you had already covered that I heard you in commenting on this article.
[01:26:16.514 --> 01:26:20.179]  But then I bet Homeland Security, oh, I bet they've already been out there for the other guy.
[01:26:20.179 --> 01:26:24.385]  I bet if you go ask the professor, I bet he's been threatened and I bet they're fluttering around there.
[01:26:24.785 --> 01:26:26.845]  Yeah, I would imagine that too.
[01:26:26.845 --> 01:26:27.406]  Guaranteed.
[01:26:27.406 --> 01:26:27.846]  Go check it.
[01:26:27.846 --> 01:26:29.046]  You'll find out that's the case.
[01:26:29.046 --> 01:26:31.286]  These guys are so predictable, it's unbelievable.
[01:26:31.286 --> 01:26:41.729]  You know, also, Alex, Jeff has shared with me that they checked the water to the college there, and it had very high concentrations of fluoride and other chemicals.
[01:26:41.729 --> 01:26:50.170]  He said they put a filtration system on the college water system, and since then, the students' health has improved dramatically.
[01:26:50.170 --> 01:26:51.251]  Amazing.
[01:26:51.251 --> 01:26:52.211]  Let me just add this.
[01:26:52.211 --> 01:26:53.031]  I have family.
[01:26:54.557 --> 01:27:17.138]  In a little town in East Texas, and he is the head guy at the water treatment, and it comes out of the ground out of an aquifer, totally clean, they had a big fight six years ago about it, totally clean, and the feds came in and threatened them, and then with the state, made them add fluoride and chlorine to the aquifer, pure spring water.
[01:27:19.276 --> 01:27:20.417]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:27:20.417 --> 01:27:24.778]  And by the way, it's the same level that's in a swimming pool that kills fish, but we drink it.
[01:27:24.778 --> 01:27:31.601]  Guaranteed to cause liver cancer, bladder cancer, kidney cancer, just the chlorine alone.
[01:27:31.601 --> 01:27:34.162]  Again, your loving government.
[01:27:34.162 --> 01:27:39.984]  I mean, and again, that's just another example I was hearing about this weekend from family about how they were going, but why?
[01:27:39.984 --> 01:27:40.904]  The water's perfect.
[01:27:40.904 --> 01:27:41.664]  It's totally clean.
[01:27:41.664 --> 01:27:43.365]  They said, you will add this.
[01:27:43.365 --> 01:27:43.825]  You understand?
[01:27:44.830 --> 01:27:56.933]  Yeah, Alex, Jeff also shared with me, he has a personal friend that's with the police force, I think the sheriff's there in that area, and he quit the force, or he is quitting, because he said now they're issuing them tasers.
[01:28:01.064 --> 01:28:08.993]  And the second you argue or ask a question, they now taser you, and then when you die, the judges order the coroner not to say the tasers kill you.
[01:28:08.993 --> 01:28:15.420]  Hey Alex, if I have time, I'd just like to real briefly share a personal experience I had with CPS.
[01:28:16.341 --> 01:28:18.082]  Oh, it just goes on and on, sure.
[01:28:18.082 --> 01:28:20.804]  Oh yeah, I mean, I'm Mark, I know this.
[01:28:20.804 --> 01:28:25.107]  I'm not, you know, me going on, giving my name, Steve Barber, okay, so what?
[01:28:25.107 --> 01:28:30.050]  You guys already know who I am, but I'm gonna stand up for what I know is right, because I'd rather burn than bow.
[01:28:33.604 --> 01:28:40.470]  Back when my oldest son was 7 years old, this is about like 96, 97, we had an incident happen.
[01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:47.516]  He woke up in the middle of the night and was having apparently what was a nightmare and I tried to wake him up by gently smacking him on both sides of the face.
[01:28:47.516 --> 01:28:48.457]  I left a bruise.
[01:28:49.277 --> 01:28:52.760]  And so, I called a friend of mine, who's a pastor.
[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:59.146]  He took me to a local hospital, and in my heart, I was just having this impression, don't do this, there's gonna be trouble.
[01:28:59.146 --> 01:29:00.187]  Well, we went anyway.
[01:29:00.187 --> 01:29:04.470]  I explained to the intake person what happened.
[01:29:04.470 --> 01:29:07.793]  Then the doctors there talked to me about it.
[01:29:07.793 --> 01:29:13.979]  Then they took my son back to be x-rayed, and the guy doing the x-rays told me, you can't go back there with him.
[01:29:13.979 --> 01:29:16.561]  I've since found out that was a violation of my rights.
[01:29:17.362 --> 01:29:21.965]  They didn't even read me the hospital's policy about this, which I later found out.
[01:29:21.965 --> 01:29:25.628]  But then, the police came and interrogated me about this.
[01:29:25.628 --> 01:29:28.650]  By the way, a lot of people, your son was sleepwalking.
[01:29:28.650 --> 01:29:34.834]  You get in a spot between waking and sleeping and you might have tried cold water, but I understand you're now with Al-Qaeda.
[01:29:34.834 --> 01:29:36.195]  By the way, it's 50 times worse now.
[01:29:36.195 --> 01:29:37.576]  They just hire more and more.
[01:29:37.576 --> 01:29:41.799]  Wait till we get to all the police state news today.
[01:29:41.799 --> 01:29:43.200]  We're on the march.
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:44.721]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:45.712 --> 01:29:51.736]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:51.736 --> 01:29:53.557]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Dimon.
[01:29:53.557 --> 01:29:59.540]  You can now get the most important package ever on what has happened to the Catholic Church in the last 50 years.
[01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:07.445]  Find out how this massive crisis concerning the Catholic Church happened, what happened, and how the Bible predicted it would take place in the last days.
[01:30:07.965 --> 01:30:15.872]  The package contains six DVDs that contain ten different programs, two books that combine to over a thousand pages and other information.

[01:30:51.778 --> 01:30:55.540]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[01:30:55.540 --> 01:31:00.562]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[01:31:00.562 --> 01:31:06.044]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[01:31:06.044 --> 01:31:16.529]  Though the people of the U.S., where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reigning them in and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[01:31:17.029 --> 01:31:21.411]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[01:31:21.411 --> 01:31:24.191]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.

[01:32:38.781 --> 01:32:40.883]  Mention GCN Live for a free gift.
[01:32:55.154 --> 01:33:10.161]  Yeah, I've been spending an hour and a half today talking about how they've secretly recruited tens of thousands of pastors, half a million truck drivers, school teachers, everybody.
[01:33:10.161 --> 01:33:13.542]  And they've got them all looking for terrorists, and they're gonna find them.
[01:33:13.542 --> 01:33:20.605]  And terrorism is talking about freedom and liberty, owning private property, Second Amendment rallies, property rights rallies.
[01:33:20.605 --> 01:33:21.706]  I have their training manuals.
[01:33:22.679 --> 01:33:24.181]  And of course, they are the terrorists.
[01:33:24.181 --> 01:33:25.764]  They are the ones destroying our liberty.
[01:33:25.764 --> 01:33:26.665]  We're the boss.
[01:33:26.665 --> 01:33:28.448]  You're not authorities or officials.
[01:33:28.448 --> 01:33:30.331]  You're servants, you crooks!
[01:33:30.331 --> 01:33:34.898]  But you work for big foreign banks that are subdividing and strip-mining the country now.
[01:33:34.898 --> 01:33:36.581]  We're going into criminal receivership.
[01:33:37.443 --> 01:33:39.224]  Now I got a bunch of news I'm going to cover in a moment.
[01:33:39.224 --> 01:33:46.428]  Then we got We Are Change Ohio popping in who confronted Al Gore about his new false threat of carbon.
[01:33:46.428 --> 01:33:50.231]  Now I hear local ads all over Austin about reduce your carbon footprint.
[01:33:50.231 --> 01:33:50.991]  Anti-human.
[01:33:50.991 --> 01:33:55.774]  Prince Phillips come out again calling for one-child policies in the U.S.
[01:33:55.774 --> 01:33:57.915]  It's all happening boys and girls.
[01:33:57.915 --> 01:33:58.736]  It's all happening.
[01:33:59.648 --> 01:34:01.029]  And so we're going to go over all that.
[01:34:01.029 --> 01:34:04.633]  Then we got G. Edward Griffin for the last hour and a half of the show via telephone.
[01:34:04.633 --> 01:34:06.394]  I enjoyed him in studio so much.
[01:34:06.394 --> 01:34:11.859]  I'm going to do a part two and open the phones up for you to have a chance to call in and talk to him.
[01:34:11.859 --> 01:34:18.665]  But right now, moving quick, going back to Steve Barber out in East Texas at East Texas Bible School.
[01:34:18.665 --> 01:34:19.566]  He lives there in the area.
[01:34:19.566 --> 01:34:23.969]  His friend goes there and was told, you don't teach kids about the Constitution.
[01:34:23.969 --> 01:34:24.770]  That's terrorism.
[01:34:24.770 --> 01:34:25.411]  You'll be arrested.
[01:34:26.572 --> 01:34:28.033]  That's a quote, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:28.033 --> 01:34:29.034]  You're not allowed to do that now.
[01:34:29.034 --> 01:34:30.114]  That's freedom.
[01:34:30.114 --> 01:34:35.538]  I've got to defend the Constitution by not allowing you to teach it.
[01:34:35.538 --> 01:34:38.901]  It's all about creeping and color of law and intimidating people.
[01:34:38.901 --> 01:34:40.962]  These people are crooks.
[01:34:40.962 --> 01:34:41.803]  People run the system.
[01:34:41.803 --> 01:34:43.204]  They know we're coming for them.
[01:34:43.204 --> 01:34:44.925]  So this is their rearguard action.
[01:34:44.925 --> 01:34:49.729]  They need to take over or they know we're going to bring them to justice.
[01:34:49.729 --> 01:34:53.352]  What ended up happening with child kidnapping, child pedophile services?
[01:34:54.269 --> 01:34:56.110]  I've actually had two incidents with them.
[01:34:56.110 --> 01:35:04.394]  The first one I was talking about, they actually sent a young woman out to our door and so she basically interrogated all of our kids.
[01:35:04.394 --> 01:35:10.517]  Now to go back to the part about the police showing up, because your son had been in a sleepwalking incident.
[01:35:10.517 --> 01:35:15.400]  Yeah, they came, the hospital officials called the police unbeknownst to me.
[01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:17.301]  They came out, asked me what happened.
[01:35:17.301 --> 01:35:20.262]  I told them the same exact thing I told the hospital officials.
[01:35:20.262 --> 01:35:21.743]  So they wrote down a bunch of notes.
[01:35:22.583 --> 01:35:28.207]  And this is while my son was back being x-rayed, and they wouldn't let me go back there with him.
[01:35:28.207 --> 01:35:30.389]  Yeah, that was while he was being interrogated.
[01:35:30.389 --> 01:35:30.829]  Right.
[01:35:30.829 --> 01:35:34.612]  Well, my son told me, they're asking, does your parents spank you?
[01:35:34.612 --> 01:35:36.693]  Do you go to church?
[01:35:36.693 --> 01:35:38.374]  You know, they're asking these kind of questions.
[01:35:38.374 --> 01:35:40.616]  Do they smoke marijuana?
[01:35:40.616 --> 01:35:41.597]  Right.
[01:35:41.597 --> 01:35:46.020]  Have you seen your daddy's... Have you seen your... And they pull out a doll that has genitalia?
[01:35:46.721 --> 01:35:49.162]  And, you know, what kid hadn't walked in while you're in the shower?
[01:35:49.162 --> 01:35:50.383]  It's over, kids are gone.
[01:35:50.383 --> 01:35:51.603]  Flown to Saudi Arabia.
[01:35:51.603 --> 01:35:52.244]  Go ahead.
[01:35:52.244 --> 01:35:53.284]  But here's the thing.
[01:35:53.284 --> 01:35:58.767]  The next day, the CPS worker showed up, and so she talked to all our kids individually.
[01:35:58.767 --> 01:36:00.567]  I got a friend named... No warrant, though, right?
[01:36:00.567 --> 01:36:03.048]  The pedophile worker showed up without a warrant.
[01:36:03.048 --> 01:36:03.929]  Right.
[01:36:03.929 --> 01:36:06.230]  And I got a friend named Albert James Dagger.
[01:36:07.118 --> 01:36:15.502]  I've actually just told him he's getting your Endgame documentary, because he's been warning people about the eugenics program since the 60s.
[01:36:15.502 --> 01:36:21.565]  But he wrote a pamphlet called What to Do When They Come for Your Children, and I had just read this that week.
[01:36:21.565 --> 01:36:24.586]  But anyway, I know how to conduct myself with these people, but here's the thing.
[01:36:25.825 --> 01:36:36.850]  The conclusion of this woman's so-called interviews, she said to me, well, I just need to look around in your apartment, and this is a quote, I can see if you have any torture weapons.
[01:36:38.444 --> 01:36:45.308]  This is what she said to me, and when I called my lawyer, who got her to back off, because he said, yeah, this is the kind of tactics they use.
[01:36:45.308 --> 01:36:48.510]  Eventually, we were cleared of any so-called wrongdoing.
[01:36:48.510 --> 01:36:53.513]  And then they call a steak knife in the drawer a torture weapon, yeah.
[01:36:53.513 --> 01:36:53.954]  Right.
[01:36:53.954 --> 01:36:55.955]  Steak knives, get your kids flown to Saudi, yeah.
[01:36:56.255 --> 01:37:04.962]  But in 2003, our youngest child died from a disease called diabetic ketoacidosis of Texas children.
[01:37:04.962 --> 01:37:13.129]  We had CPS show up the next day, and they were actually trying to accuse us of child abuse and medical neglect.
[01:37:13.129 --> 01:37:16.131]  Something that was not in their control whatsoever.
[01:37:16.131 --> 01:37:17.172]  Sorry to hear about your child.
[01:37:17.172 --> 01:37:20.155]  Well, listen, I appreciate you and I appreciate the time.
[01:37:20.155 --> 01:37:20.935]  Yes, sir.
[01:37:20.935 --> 01:37:22.096]  We'll stay in contact.
[01:37:22.096 --> 01:37:23.597]  Oh, God, help me.
[01:37:23.597 --> 01:37:24.218]  I can't handle it.
[01:37:26.893 --> 01:37:30.554]  I can't handle these ravenous packs of wolves running around.
[01:37:30.554 --> 01:37:40.276]  By the way, I wasn't even looking for it, and I saw five articles this morning about CPS workers and CPS chiefs being child rapers.
[01:37:40.276 --> 01:37:46.257]  I mean, every day there is a pack of child raping demons.
[01:37:46.257 --> 01:37:49.238]  No judge, no jury, no due process.
[01:37:49.238 --> 01:37:50.378]  They just rule.
[01:37:51.639 --> 01:37:55.763]  And every year they have to seize more children than the last to get their federal funds.
[01:37:55.763 --> 01:37:59.266]  And the federal documents, textbooks, they say the family's the enemy.
[01:37:59.266 --> 01:38:05.712]  It's all about breaking up the family to reduce population numbers under the eugenics protocol.
[01:38:05.712 --> 01:38:09.295]  Implemented in 1906 in the federal register.
[01:38:09.295 --> 01:38:10.716]  It's just all over.
[01:38:10.716 --> 01:38:14.279]  Oh God, these people are just everywhere.
[01:38:14.279 --> 01:38:16.461]  Scum, trash, filth.
[01:38:16.461 --> 01:38:17.562]  All of them.
[01:38:17.562 --> 01:38:18.023]  Oh man.
[01:38:19.269 --> 01:38:31.832]  And I'm not kidding, tens of thousands of American children flown out to Israel and Saudi Arabia, those are the two main ones, where they're openly snuffed, filmed, murdered, tortured.
[01:38:31.832 --> 01:38:46.355]  I mean, just when they get where they're not sexually desirable to pedophiles anymore, they fly them out to these different island chains, where it's not just a sweat house, sweat shop, they actually chain them to the sewing machines.
[01:38:46.355 --> 01:38:47.775]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:38:49.264 --> 01:38:52.226]  Your government's total, Phil.
[01:38:52.226 --> 01:38:57.831]  I remember back in 2002, it was already over 3,500 kids missing in Florida.
[01:38:57.831 --> 01:39:03.555]  They found some of them buried in shallow graves all over the U.S., heads chopped off, ritually murdered.
[01:39:07.344 --> 01:39:09.806]  You can't even make this, this stuff's so insane!
[01:39:09.806 --> 01:39:32.862]  I'm saying all this and it's like, it sounds made up, it's so nuts, that I have an FBI training manual right here for the police that says if you encounter any of the following, called the Joint Terrorism Task Force, Federal Bureau of Investigation 201 East Indianola Avenue, Phoenix, Arizona 85012, Investigator Al Shearer, and it says those that make frequent references to the U.S.
[01:39:32.862 --> 01:39:36.204]  Constitution, those that say they are quote, defenders of the U.S.
[01:39:36.204 --> 01:39:36.905]  Constitution,
[01:39:38.522 --> 01:39:44.486]  Those that claim that driving is a right, not a privilege.
[01:39:44.486 --> 01:39:46.847]  It says Christian.
[01:39:46.847 --> 01:39:47.568]  Identity.
[01:39:47.568 --> 01:39:52.291]  It says animal rights.
[01:39:52.291 --> 01:39:56.033]  Anti-abortion.
[01:39:56.033 --> 01:39:57.134]  Lone individuals.
[01:39:57.134 --> 01:40:01.216]  And then I got worse manuals where they say wearing blue jeans and having a cell phone.
[01:40:01.216 --> 01:40:03.638]  Having a driving almanac in your car.
[01:40:03.638 --> 01:40:05.219]  Go ahead and bring them in for questioning.
[01:40:07.074 --> 01:40:28.041]  I mean, you try to go to the Texas coast, you try to go down to Bolivar by Galveston, you pull up, and they'll have these ne'er-do-wells in little commando outfits that weigh about 500 pounds, and they pull over the little families and search your car and search you, and I mean, it's all training you how to be a slave.
[01:40:28.041 --> 01:40:30.442]  You gotta have some slob search you.
[01:40:30.442 --> 01:40:33.043]  It's training you how to be a slave.
[01:40:37.779 --> 01:40:39.221]  And this filthy government.
[01:40:39.221 --> 01:40:41.863]  This filthy scumbag.
[01:40:41.863 --> 01:40:44.826]  I can't even talk anymore.
[01:40:44.826 --> 01:40:47.289]  We are just scum.
[01:40:47.289 --> 01:40:50.633]  I'm really having a moment of anger right now.
[01:40:50.633 --> 01:40:53.175]  I can't get mad anymore.
[01:40:53.175 --> 01:41:00.303]  Can you imagine in this country that you teach a group of Boy Scouts that come to visit your college and you work for the administration.
[01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:10.242]  That, uh, you gotta defend the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, and that's your job as a Cub Scout, as a Boy Scout, which is what they taught when I was in there, which is what he was taught.
[01:41:10.242 --> 01:41:12.242]  Just a standard speech!
[01:41:12.242 --> 01:41:20.284]  And Homeland Security shows up and says, you'll be arrested, or worse, if you ever talk like this again, you're not allowed to talk like this.
[01:41:20.284 --> 01:41:22.084]  In America, boy!
[01:41:22.084 --> 01:41:23.264]  You're not allowed!
[01:41:23.264 --> 01:41:27.325]  I mean, it'd be one thing if they said, you're not allowed to talk about Communism.
[01:41:27.325 --> 01:41:31.646]  You know, I'd say, well, I don't agree with Communism, and it's not his place to really be teaching kids that, but
[01:41:32.523 --> 01:41:34.644]  You know, that's your First Amendment right.
[01:41:34.644 --> 01:41:38.425]  No, it wasn't that.
[01:41:38.425 --> 01:41:44.666]  It was, don't talk about freedom.
[01:41:44.666 --> 01:41:46.567]  You can't make this type of stuff up.
[01:41:46.567 --> 01:41:52.229]  Okay, I got a bunch of news here.
[01:41:52.229 --> 01:41:53.289]  Doctors condemn
[01:41:55.382 --> 01:41:57.423]  Threatening taser court ruling.
[01:41:57.423 --> 01:42:05.509]  I wanted to get into that because that dovetails with, in New York, they're saying that you're not allowed to ever bring up the Second Amendment in a court case.
[01:42:05.509 --> 01:42:09.192]  They say that that is, quote, banned.
[01:42:09.192 --> 01:42:19.038]  And of course, we have feds and all these other hundreds of cases, a famous one in Denver, saying that the Constitution is not admissible in federal court.
[01:42:19.038 --> 01:42:22.781]  Just like you can't talk about it to the Boy Scouts.
[01:42:23.874 --> 01:42:29.980]  But I thought I would get to this for you first.
[01:42:29.980 --> 01:42:42.891]  Keeping kids in the classroom, area school system tackling the issue with a focus on prevention and stronger enforcement.
[01:42:42.891 --> 01:42:48.236]  Now remember, these are government training camps designed and chartered to dumb people down and teach them how to not read.
[01:42:49.426 --> 01:42:58.935]  Publicly, we've had 30 plus guests on, read the documents, posted them, sell books that are the size of phone books, just full of government documents, where it says their job.
[01:42:58.935 --> 01:43:01.778]  They test to make sure they've dumbed you down.
[01:43:01.778 --> 01:43:03.900]  That's public.
[01:43:03.900 --> 01:43:04.981]  But look at this.
[01:43:04.981 --> 01:43:14.490]  Keeping kids in the classroom, area school system, tackling the issue with a focus on prevention and stronger enforcement.
[01:43:14.490 --> 01:43:14.550]  Oh!
[01:43:15.279 --> 01:43:29.282]  The problem of truancy has drawn widespread attention this year, prompting some area lawmakers to call for tough measures to keep track of most habitual offenders and leading school officials, officials, not servants, to crack down on those who constantly skip class.
[01:43:30.544 --> 01:43:40.689]  It is recently concluded session, the Maryland General Assembly passed a measure that would make it possible to deny driver's license to students who have too many unexcused absences.
[01:43:40.689 --> 01:43:42.810]  You'll pay a fine even if you drop out of school.
[01:43:42.810 --> 01:43:44.590]  It's all about controlling you.
[01:43:44.590 --> 01:43:46.851]  Governor Martin O'Malley is expected to sign.
[01:43:46.851 --> 01:43:48.672]  They're like, aren't you for being educated?
[01:43:48.672 --> 01:43:55.475]  Going to school where you learn how to take Ritalin and Prozac and where you learn how to buy cocaine and where you learn how to be frisked by the cops?
[01:43:55.475 --> 01:43:56.876]  Don't you want to go to the filth pit?
[01:43:57.668 --> 01:44:06.136]  So you can then go on to a college where the college is, again, a very small percentage, less than 10% of it, is just a school and the football team.
[01:44:06.136 --> 01:44:17.526]  That's a facade for all the money laundering and drug dealing and bank owning and sports team owning and radio network owning and that's who these people are.
[01:44:17.526 --> 01:44:19.208]  UT.
[01:44:19.208 --> 01:44:21.430]  It's not even real, do you understand?
[01:44:21.430 --> 01:44:22.511]  It's a facade!
[01:44:25.385 --> 01:44:34.128]  And they're getting ready to make their full move, so they got Homeland Security out saying, you don't teach Boy Scouts about freedom, that's terrorism.
[01:44:34.128 --> 01:44:36.729]  Because the terrorists attacked us because they hate our freedom.
[01:44:36.729 --> 01:44:37.850]  And who hates our freedom?
[01:44:37.850 --> 01:44:38.530]  The terrorists.
[01:44:38.530 --> 01:44:41.071]  It's very simple.
[01:44:41.071 --> 01:44:44.192]  See, they have little lawyer jokes to your face.
[01:44:44.192 --> 01:44:48.053]  The terrorists did this because they want your freedom, and that's exactly why the terrorists did it.
[01:44:48.053 --> 01:44:49.214]  It's just the terrorists are them.
[01:44:52.242 --> 01:45:00.328]  In its recently concluded session, the Maryland General Assembly passed a measure that would make it possible to deny driver's licenses to students who have too many excused absences.
[01:45:00.328 --> 01:45:09.674]  During the same session, lawmakers and Prince George proposed strapping ankle bracelets on students to electronically monitor the whereabouts of those who constantly skip school.
[01:45:09.674 --> 01:45:17.739]  That bill did not advance, but the county's police announced April 11th that they had caught 425 truants in a crackdown that began in February.
[01:45:17.739 --> 01:45:18.200]  We had the
[01:45:19.930 --> 01:45:27.315]  State prosecutor on for Maryland, who's over Prince George County.
[01:45:27.315 --> 01:45:31.378]  1,500 students.
[01:45:31.378 --> 01:45:37.923]  We posted the CNN newscast, lined up at the courthouse with dogs and police in black riot gear.
[01:45:38.684 --> 01:45:44.766]  Barking with the parents saying, yes, it's the law, we've got to vaccinate them, we're sorry.
[01:45:44.766 --> 01:45:47.667]  Some parents saying, we don't like it, but it's the law, we're here to do it.
[01:45:47.667 --> 01:45:50.048]  No judge, no jury, no summons, no arrest.
[01:45:50.048 --> 01:45:58.591]  Just lying, color of law, fraudulent criminal announcements, that it's the law, that you have to take vaccines, lined up, being injected.
[01:45:58.591 --> 01:46:02.333]  Then I had the attorney on, the state attorney, and I said,
[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:06.482]  Oh, uh, there's no law you have to take this.
[01:46:06.482 --> 01:46:09.365]  He goes, you're right, there's no law and my kids don't vaccinate.
[01:46:09.365 --> 01:46:11.606]  And I said, oh, but you said it was the law there.
[01:46:11.606 --> 01:46:15.570]  And he hemmed and hawed and sidestepped it.
[01:46:15.570 --> 01:46:17.671]  You understand?
[01:46:17.671 --> 01:46:19.413]  They had police dogs there.
[01:46:19.413 --> 01:46:20.874]  It's all criminal.
[01:46:20.874 --> 01:46:23.176]  It's all about conning you.
[01:46:23.176 --> 01:46:25.818]  It's all about manipulating you.
[01:46:25.818 --> 01:46:29.121]  Those cops are under their own system of tyranny with their commanders over them.
[01:46:29.121 --> 01:46:31.563]  They roll their sleeves up and they take their shot too.
[01:46:32.814 --> 01:46:42.502]  So they can lie in that hospital bed with tumors all over their body, their brain, their lungs, their liver, so they can die and so all their savings can be sucked up by the Rockefellers.
[01:46:43.789 --> 01:46:46.671]  And so when you're dying, just love your God.
[01:46:46.671 --> 01:46:51.375]  Just sit there and shoot those kids up and have those dogs there growling.
[01:46:51.375 --> 01:46:55.658]  And come up to reporters we had on the show and tell them they're not allowed to be there.
[01:46:55.658 --> 01:47:03.445]  Tell them they're not allowed to be there while your dog... Imagine cops in black walk over to reporters and say, an activist, you're not allowed to be here talking to the line of people.
[01:47:03.445 --> 01:47:04.245]  Get out of here!
[01:47:04.245 --> 01:47:05.827]  This isn't a free speech zone.
[01:47:05.827 --> 01:47:08.929]  But we're just here handing out literature saying it's not the law.
[01:47:08.929 --> 01:47:09.890]  Get out of here!
[01:47:10.911 --> 01:47:13.755]  You see how it's already a drill for forced inoculations?
[01:47:13.755 --> 01:47:17.960]  The preachers, the police, everywhere brainwashed, everywhere ready.
[01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:28.753]  More and more bureaucracies and viral cops, family cops, family services, elderly services, scanners using the NSA satellites now to look at your houses.
[01:47:29.133 --> 01:47:30.494]  They're the bad guys.
[01:47:30.494 --> 01:47:31.475]  You bet I hate them.
[01:47:31.475 --> 01:47:32.675]  I wish we still had a free country.
[01:47:32.675 --> 01:47:33.796]  I'd be at the beach every weekend.
[01:47:33.796 --> 01:47:35.377]  I'd be fishing every weekend.
[01:47:58.641 --> 01:48:01.783]  I'd be working the minimum amount and spending time with my family.
[01:48:01.783 --> 01:48:04.484]  But instead, I've got a thousand things I want to do.
[01:48:04.484 --> 01:48:06.805]  A thousand different projects I want to carry out.
[01:48:06.805 --> 01:48:11.307]  Books and films I want to make, and websites I want to start, and things I want to do.
[01:48:11.307 --> 01:48:12.788]  To fight you bastards!
[01:48:12.788 --> 01:48:17.650]  It's more than just fighting evil, and that's my main reason, but it's also so crazy!
[01:48:17.650 --> 01:48:20.191]  How do they say George Washington's bad?
[01:48:20.191 --> 01:48:21.912]  How do they say freedom's bad?
[01:48:21.912 --> 01:48:25.394]  And while they say they're protecting freedom, how do they get away with all of this?
[01:48:29.033 --> 01:48:30.074]  They're color of law!
[01:48:30.074 --> 01:48:32.716]  Now they murder us every day with the tasers?
[01:48:32.716 --> 01:48:36.698]  And then they have judges tell the doctors you're not allowed to say that taser kills people?
[01:48:36.698 --> 01:48:41.742]  Tasers, 50,000 volts, electroshock, causes fatal heart rhythm.
[01:48:41.742 --> 01:48:52.409]  And it's got one of the top heart experts in Canada and a major organization coming out and saying, yeah, this thing was never even animal or human tested before it was put out.
[01:48:52.409 --> 01:48:55.251]  Tasers answer?
[01:48:55.251 --> 01:48:58.714]  Well, they just waddle in and declare national security and they're allowed to do whatever they want.
[01:49:00.476 --> 01:49:01.297]  Oh, God help us.
[01:49:01.297 --> 01:49:07.562]  It's just God help us.
[01:49:07.562 --> 01:49:09.684]  It's total evil, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:09.684 --> 01:49:10.304]  Total evil.
[01:49:10.304 --> 01:49:12.546]  You know, here's a key story today.
[01:49:12.546 --> 01:49:14.027]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:49:14.027 --> 01:49:19.452]  Wannabe virus Prince Philip attacks big families.
[01:49:19.452 --> 01:49:22.855]  And of course, photos with him and Hitler and others have come out because he's German.
[01:49:24.233 --> 01:49:42.697]  And there's this weird cult of worshipping the Nazis out there that we're supposed to say they didn't have power, or we're supposed to not say Arnold was a Nazi, or we're not supposed to say that Prince Philip was a Nazi, or Prince Bernhard, the founder of the Bilderberg Group, that we're just supposed to ignore the whole eugenics arm.
[01:49:42.697 --> 01:49:44.098]  I don't know who these people are.
[01:49:44.098 --> 01:49:46.758]  I don't know who they're working for now.
[01:49:46.758 --> 01:49:52.940]  I just know that he has given billions of dollars and raised billions to carry out eugenics programs
[01:49:54.090 --> 01:50:05.556]  And that he says he wants to kill eighty percent of us, and that he's pushing for a global carbon tax, and his son, Prince Charles, is running around pushing it, and was in Austin a few months ago pushing it.
[01:50:05.556 --> 01:50:11.139]  So you can argue all day about, you know, eugenics is part of the agenda.
[01:50:11.139 --> 01:50:12.840]  That's why they're doing all this.
[01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:22.525]  You could argue about what group runs the whole New World Order, but can you just for five minutes instead spend some of your time warning people about the vaccines, and warning them about
[01:50:23.309 --> 01:50:30.795]  Uh, the, the, the, the... 1 in 3 getting cancer from 1 in 33.
[01:50:30.795 --> 01:50:32.737]  And 1 in 3 getting diabetes from 1 in 1,000.
[01:50:32.737 --> 01:50:46.368]  And, and, and... Kids up and down every place I live, and everybody I know with babies dying left and right after they take shots now, and tumors growing out everywhere, and GMO foods, I mean, can't you?
[01:50:46.368 --> 01:50:48.710]  You know, these people are Nazis!
[01:50:48.710 --> 01:50:49.331]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.861]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:50:54.861 --> 01:50:56.422]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[01:50:56.422 --> 01:50:58.562]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:50:58.562 --> 01:51:00.463]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:51:00.463 --> 01:51:01.944]  The late great USA.
[01:51:01.944 --> 01:51:03.724]  America, freedom to fascism.

[01:51:51.616 --> 01:51:55.419]  Hello, I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 15 books on health and natural healing.
[01:51:55.419 --> 01:51:59.541]  Vaccines included, medicines kill more people every year than any illness.
[01:51:59.541 --> 01:52:06.366]  The cost of drug side effects in America is more than $200 billion annually, with a worse toll taken by antibiotics.
[01:52:06.366 --> 01:52:09.248]  But there is a cure for this medical madness that has remained secret.
[01:52:09.648 --> 01:52:19.054]  OxySilver, developed by NASA scientists to keep astronauts healthy, is an evolutionary new dietary supplement making deadly vaccinations and antibiotics obsolete.
[01:52:19.054 --> 01:52:23.718]  Taking one to two teaspoons daily boosts natural immunity without drug toxicity.

[01:52:26.820 --> 01:52:33.284]  The oxygen becomes a supercharged germ killer freeing your immune system to fight colds, flus, cancers, and more.

[01:53:02.396 --> 01:53:07.098]  The Balance Bracelet not only looks good, it performs beyond most people's expectations.

[01:53:10.582 --> 01:53:14.027]  Ask someone who wears one, or better yet, try one for yourself.
[01:53:14.027 --> 01:53:18.133]  The silver band with gold terminals is still the most popular and a best seller.
[01:53:18.133 --> 01:53:25.002]  The balance bracelet has no magnets, but is ionized in such a way that wearers are so delighted they refuse to ever take theirs off.

[01:54:13.312 --> 01:54:15.994]  Bill did a great job on his
[01:54:18.223 --> 01:54:24.668]  Left side of the pincer attack, they use terrorism as the cover to attack the public and enslave us.
[01:54:24.668 --> 01:54:33.334]  On the false right paradigm attack, and on the false left paradigm pincer, they use global warming, which they openly say carbon is the devil weapon.
[01:54:33.334 --> 01:54:36.617]  Carbon dioxide, which humans exhale, therefore we're the enemy.
[01:54:36.617 --> 01:54:39.139]  Official CFR documents.
[01:54:39.139 --> 01:54:43.242]  And everybody bought into the fad, gibbering and giggling like moron monkeys.
[01:54:45.527 --> 01:54:47.267]  You like being conned to public?
[01:54:47.267 --> 01:54:49.288]  You like always being taken for a ride?
[01:54:49.288 --> 01:54:54.611]  You love losing and losing and losing and being moron idiots?
[01:54:54.611 --> 01:54:55.712]  It's just so obvious!
[01:54:55.712 --> 01:54:58.693]  How could anybody be conned by this stuff?
[01:54:58.693 --> 01:55:00.274]  I'm not saying our listeners are idiots.
[01:55:00.274 --> 01:55:01.315]  I mean the general public.
[01:55:01.315 --> 01:55:02.875]  I mean, I just can't handle it anymore!
[01:55:02.875 --> 01:55:06.797]  Okay, I'm gonna stop right there.
[01:55:06.797 --> 01:55:09.339]  Hold on.
[01:55:09.339 --> 01:55:11.119]  I'm gonna stop right there.
[01:55:11.119 --> 01:55:13.981]  An incredible article with Prince Philip
[01:55:16.050 --> 01:55:35.753]  And it says, Nazi collaborator and racist advocate, who says blacks aren't human, but that's okay, mass genocide Prince Philip, a man who has often expressed his desire to return to the earth as a deadly virus to thin the human population by 80%, says there are too many people in the world, as he attacked large families in a television interview set for air this week.
[01:55:36.613 --> 01:55:42.936]  The Duke says that curbing family size must be the best means of keeping a soaring cost of stable food products.
[01:55:42.936 --> 01:55:47.399]  So see, they artificially depress the food supply and then say, oh, there's too many humans.
[01:55:47.399 --> 01:55:48.720]  So that's that's the talking point.
[01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:50.581]  You see Al Gore doing that.
[01:55:50.581 --> 01:55:54.102]  Such as bread and rice in check, reported the London Times.
[01:55:54.102 --> 01:55:58.024]  Food prices are going up, he tells the interviewer, Sir Trevor MacDonald.
[01:55:58.024 --> 01:55:58.725]  Everyone thinks
[01:55:59.887 --> 01:56:03.668]  It's to do with not enough food, but it's really that demand is too great.
[01:56:03.668 --> 01:56:07.850]  Too many people, basically, it's a little embarrassing for everybody.
[01:56:07.850 --> 01:56:09.230]  No one quite knows how to handle it.
[01:56:09.230 --> 01:56:15.033]  Nobody wants their family life to be interfered with by the government, but we have to.
[01:56:15.033 --> 01:56:18.154]  And then it's got all these incredible quotes where he says we've got to kill everybody.
[01:56:18.154 --> 01:56:19.754]  You can go read them.
[01:56:19.754 --> 01:56:23.456]  And it's got photos of him with, you know, Hitler and everybody else.
[01:56:23.456 --> 01:56:26.857]  And see, my whole point is, whoever's running this eugenics, we need to fight it.
[01:56:27.757 --> 01:56:31.379]  I mean, we know the New World Order today isn't what you'd call the original Nazis.
[01:56:31.379 --> 01:56:35.280]  I've always said the Nazis were a sub-brand, a sub-spinoff.
[01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:36.841]  They're obsessed with race.
[01:56:36.841 --> 01:56:39.222]  The Zionists are obsessed with race.
[01:56:39.222 --> 01:56:41.943]  They're all obsessed with breeding and whose family they're from.
[01:56:41.943 --> 01:56:43.904]  The point is, they're attacking us.
[01:56:43.904 --> 01:56:48.906]  Black, white, old, young, Mexican, Chinese, it doesn't matter, folks.
[01:56:48.906 --> 01:56:50.467]  You're under attack by these people.
[01:56:50.467 --> 01:56:57.070]  You can be a white guy in East Texas or a black guy in North Carolina, and we just better realize this is the issue.
[01:56:57.739 --> 01:57:05.062]  I mean, the Hitler lovers out there can't even fight eugenics because they're too busy saying Hitler was a good guy who got a raw deal.
[01:57:05.062 --> 01:57:11.325]  Hey man, all I know is Prince Philip admits he admired Hitler and wants to carry out eugenics against us.
[01:57:11.325 --> 01:57:22.389]  I mean, while you're busy lovey-dovey with Hitler over there, you better realize you better not take that shot, because I guess the guys at the hospital didn't get the memo that you were white so you don't get the cancer injection.
[01:57:27.734 --> 01:57:29.215]  Just please get on to Real Issues.
[01:57:29.215 --> 01:57:32.718]  I'm begging you out there, man.
[01:57:32.718 --> 01:57:33.538]  We don't have time.
[01:57:33.538 --> 01:57:34.479]  We gotta warn everybody.
[01:57:36.545 --> 01:57:40.906]  He goes on, overlooking the fact that Prince Philip himself has four children and eight grandchildren.
[01:57:40.906 --> 01:57:46.247]  The article counts as his comments in the fallacy that His Royal Highness is a eco-warrior.
[01:57:46.247 --> 01:57:57.290]  It completely fails to point out the Duke of Edinburgh's enthusiasm for culling the human herd actually stems from his warped advocacy of eugenics and the Royal Commission on Population by his
[01:57:58.234 --> 01:58:07.341]  The father of his wife, the King of England, Queen Elizabeth's father, says it's not about population of the earth, it is about economic warfare.
[01:58:07.341 --> 01:58:15.106]  As the Alex Jones documents in his seminal documentary, Endgame, the mindset is endgame amongst the elite and is endemic.
[01:58:15.106 --> 01:58:21.591]  Prince Philip's zeal to thin the population of undesirables has little to do with his so-called green credentials as his
[01:58:23.803 --> 01:58:25.004]  Falsely argued.
[01:58:25.004 --> 01:58:26.786]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:26.786 --> 01:58:28.388]  This affects every one of you.
[01:58:28.388 --> 01:58:37.238]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:42.163 --> 01:58:43.464]  It is a big idea.
[01:58:44.611 --> 01:58:46.372]  A New World Order.
[01:58:46.372 --> 01:58:51.276]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:58:51.276 --> 01:58:54.098]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:58:54.098 --> 01:58:56.900]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:58:56.900 --> 01:59:00.082]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:59:00.082 --> 01:59:07.408]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:59:10.421 --> 01:59:15.864]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:59:15.864 --> 01:59:19.746]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:59:19.746 --> 01:59:22.307]  Gilbert is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:59:22.307 --> 01:59:23.468]  Most people have no idea.
[01:59:23.468 --> 01:59:24.248]  They're not after money.
[01:59:24.248 --> 01:59:25.509]  They have all the money they need.
[01:59:25.509 --> 01:59:26.509]  They're after power.
[01:59:26.509 --> 01:59:27.670]  That's what Apple needs here.

[01:59:39.179 --> 01:59:44.345]  You have been warned.
[01:59:44.345 --> 01:59:46.748]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:46.748 --> 01:59:49.510]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:55.891 --> 01:59:57.653]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:57.653 --> 01:59:59.234]  You want answers?
[01:59:59.234 --> 02:00:00.795]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:00.795 --> 02:00:04.979]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:04.979 --> 02:00:11.165]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:11.165 --> 02:00:14.347]  Continuing with scumbag Prince Philip.
[02:00:14.347 --> 02:00:21.133]  Prince Philip's zeal to defend the population of undesirables has little to do with his so-called green credentials as his
[02:00:24.048 --> 02:00:26.370]  Fraudulently argued by the corporate media.
[02:00:26.370 --> 02:00:35.156]  In reality, the Duke of Edinburgh was a Nazi collaborator and his racist tendencies have spilled over into public affairs in many occasions.
[02:00:35.156 --> 02:00:42.381]  Now, every time I bash eugenics, we can't have a eugenics discussion because it turns out that I'm bashing Germans.
[02:00:42.381 --> 02:00:43.462]  Much of my family's German.
[02:00:43.462 --> 02:00:44.562]  I'm not bashing Germans.
[02:00:44.562 --> 02:00:48.445]  That's how you've been mentally programmed not be able to address issues.
[02:00:48.445 --> 02:00:52.408]  You've been, even in your own movement, been programmed to not be able to address serious things.
[02:00:53.028 --> 02:00:54.869]  My point is, it's not even a British family.
[02:00:54.869 --> 02:01:09.177]  It is a German royal family, and he's a Nazi, and I mean, you know, the head of the House of Orange, another Nazi, the founder of the Bilderberg Group, that's Prince Bernhard, this is who we're dealing with.
[02:01:09.177 --> 02:01:12.999]  And they're carrying out eugenics they picked up in England and the U.S.
[02:01:12.999 --> 02:01:15.761]  So that's as far as the Nazi angle and connection goes.
[02:01:17.361 --> 02:01:18.362]  And I'm just addressing that.
[02:01:18.362 --> 02:01:19.884]  Some listeners are going, what is he talking about?
[02:01:19.884 --> 02:01:20.985]  You don't understand, folks.
[02:01:20.985 --> 02:01:27.271]  There's mentally ill members of the population that think eugenics is good, and they think it's just for other groups, not for them.
[02:01:27.271 --> 02:01:39.843]  Or they don't think it's a real issue because the Germans don't have power, and Nazis didn't exist, or are good, and are giving us little prizes under our pillows at night.
[02:01:39.843 --> 02:01:40.804]  No, Prince Philip's bad.
[02:01:43.562 --> 02:01:49.640]  As Alex Jones documents in a similar documentary film, Endgame, this mindset is endemic, again, amongst the elite.
[02:01:50.689 --> 02:02:00.156]  Prince Philip's zeal within the population of undesirables has little to do with his so-called green credentials, as is argued in the corporate media.
[02:02:00.156 --> 02:02:07.521]  In reality, the Duke of Edinburgh was a Nazi collaborator, and his racist tendencies have spilled over into public gaffes in many occasions.
[02:02:07.521 --> 02:02:08.562]  Got a link to that.
[02:02:08.562 --> 02:02:16.908]  In 86, for example, the Queen's husband remarked to a British student during a visit to China, if you stay here much longer, you will go home with slitty eyes.
[02:02:17.895 --> 02:02:22.158]  Just, and they're also so inbred, they're basically mentally retarded.
[02:02:22.158 --> 02:02:26.602]  The so-called leader, a bunch of degenerate, weak trash.
[02:02:26.602 --> 02:02:28.703]  So sick of them!
[02:02:28.703 --> 02:02:34.187]  It goes on, uh, it looks as though it was put in by an Indian, he went on.
[02:02:34.187 --> 02:02:40.712]  Philip observed when he saw a messy fuse box in a factory during a 99 visit.
[02:02:40.712 --> 02:02:45.696]  It was well documented that Prince Philip's sister, Sophia, was married to Christopher of Hesse Castle.
[02:02:47.390 --> 02:02:52.174]  A SS colonel who named his eldest son Karl Adolf in Hitler's honor.
[02:02:52.174 --> 02:02:55.637]  Indeed, all four of Philip's sisters married high-ranking Nazis.
[02:02:55.637 --> 02:02:57.118]  Well, they were German, what do you expect?
[02:02:57.118 --> 02:03:06.126]  The prospect of the former Nazis and Nazi sympathizers attending his 47th wedding to the future Queen of England meant he was only allowed to invite two guests.
[02:03:08.723 --> 02:03:10.004]  And then it goes on.
[02:03:10.004 --> 02:03:24.319]  Two years ago, more revelations of Phillips and Nazi links emerged in a book that featured never-before-published photos of Phillip, aged 16, at the 1937 funeral of his elder sister, flanked by relatives in SS and brownshirt uniforms.
[02:03:24.319 --> 02:03:30.605]  Another picture shows his youngest sister, Sophia, sitting opposite Hitler at the wedding of Hermann Goering.
[02:03:32.190 --> 02:03:44.226]  And it goes on, Philip was forced to concede that his family found Hitler's appetite to restore Germany's power and prestige attractive and admitted they had inhibitions about the Jews.
[02:03:44.226 --> 02:03:46.769]  The Duke was also trained in the Hitler youth.
[02:03:47.842 --> 02:04:06.586]  It goes on, Philip Altman, of course the truth is Britain actually set Hitler up, told him to invade, that's why he let the British evacuate at Dunkirk, that's why when Rudolf Hess flew over and said we have a deal to do this, they held him for decades in a prison by himself, and it all came out that it was all staged, and that's in mainline history books.
[02:04:07.106 --> 02:04:09.648]  They literally set Hitler up, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:09.648 --> 02:04:11.489]  But see, you want to worship Hitler.
[02:04:11.489 --> 02:04:17.933]  You don't want to admit that he was a weak chicken neck, completely set up by the globalists who were ten steps ahead of you.
[02:04:17.933 --> 02:04:25.137]  You'd rather be weak and let them always win!
[02:04:25.137 --> 02:04:26.638]  Don't worry, though.
[02:04:26.638 --> 02:04:35.784]  All of you who love the New World Order, the economy's imploding, tyrannies are growing, there are huge armies of new police march out of the
[02:04:36.863 --> 02:04:40.745]  Police academies every few months ready to destroy your country.
[02:04:40.745 --> 02:04:43.887]  Ready to smash you and take everything you got.
[02:04:43.887 --> 02:04:45.568]  Their dim little eyes.
[02:04:45.568 --> 02:04:48.609]  All they want is more power and they're gonna get it.
[02:04:48.609 --> 02:04:56.553]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut.
[02:04:56.553 --> 02:05:01.296]  An entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[02:05:01.756 --> 02:05:12.824]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[02:05:12.824 --> 02:05:16.226]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[02:05:16.226 --> 02:05:17.987]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[02:05:17.987 --> 02:05:24.131]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[02:05:48.234 --> 02:05:53.578]  The Federal Trade Commission estimates that 9 million Americans are victims of identity theft each year.
[02:05:53.578 --> 02:05:59.604]  The crime of identity theft occurs every 3.5 seconds, costing the victims an average of $8,000.

[02:06:48.340 --> 02:06:52.584]  If your body isn't feeling too well these days, you're gonna start taking this hemp.
[02:06:52.584 --> 02:06:54.245]  I say go to hempusa.org.
[02:06:58.339 --> 02:07:02.783]  You may not like what I'm about to say, but you know I'm gonna say it anyway.
[02:07:02.783 --> 02:07:05.566]  The government doesn't want the best for you.
[02:07:05.566 --> 02:07:08.008]  They keep you down, they keep you blue.
[02:07:08.008 --> 02:07:12.933]  They starve your body for all its nutrients.
[02:07:12.933 --> 02:07:15.395]  They won't let you grow industrial hemp.
[02:07:15.395 --> 02:07:20.761]  It really doesn't make any kind of sense when it's so healthy for the world and useful for you, my friends.
[02:07:22.665 --> 02:07:27.247]  I hope Mr. Bush will hear this song, for the heart of America wants this one.
[02:07:27.247 --> 02:07:32.090]  Go to hempusa.org.
[02:07:32.090 --> 02:07:37.033]  If you're a truther, an anarchist, a renegade, you only want things that God has made.
[02:07:37.033 --> 02:07:41.535]  Go to hempusa.org.
[02:07:41.535 --> 02:07:43.756]  We offer free shipping anywhere in the states.
[02:07:43.756 --> 02:07:45.937]  Go to hempusa.org.
[02:07:48.601 --> 02:07:51.341]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:07:51.341 --> 02:08:06.544]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:06.544 --> 02:08:12.225]  Look, I take off a few days and I get really aggressive, I get really mad.
[02:08:12.225 --> 02:08:16.206]  They know that the
[02:08:19.335 --> 02:08:29.058]  Genetically modified organism foods where they've changed the basic DNA and changed the basic protein amino acid structures.
[02:08:29.058 --> 02:08:32.839]  They know it kills all the guinea pigs, all the rats that eat it.
[02:08:32.839 --> 02:08:34.460]  In thousands of university studies.
[02:08:34.460 --> 02:08:35.300]  They know!
[02:08:35.300 --> 02:08:37.881]  And so they feed it to you and your family.
[02:08:37.881 --> 02:08:39.801]  I know there's no way to avoid all of it.
[02:08:39.801 --> 02:08:41.762]  Unless you live on a deserted island.
[02:08:41.762 --> 02:08:42.902]  And so I'm mad about that.
[02:08:42.902 --> 02:08:45.303]  I'm mad about them assaulting my children every day.
[02:08:45.303 --> 02:08:45.923]  Assaulting me.
[02:08:46.878 --> 02:08:59.289]  I'm real mad about the fact that they've put hundreds of different varieties of cancer viruses that are even timed for hormonal fluctuations to kill you at a certain age to kick in.
[02:08:59.289 --> 02:09:03.272]  I am mad about them admittedly spraying our cities on a routine basis.
[02:09:03.272 --> 02:09:05.153]  That's all declassified.
[02:09:05.153 --> 02:09:13.921]  I am mad that a group of eugenicists that openly, tens of thousands of times, sprayed our troops with chemicals, biologicals, radiologicals, killing them in many cases.
[02:09:14.750 --> 02:09:20.535]  A bunch of control freak scientists running everything that have given you a Madison Avenue false reality.
[02:09:20.535 --> 02:09:23.478]  Have you noticed we're not talking about Barack Obama here?
[02:09:23.478 --> 02:09:25.880]  Have you noticed we're not talking about Hillary and John McCain?
[02:09:25.880 --> 02:09:27.242]  Who cares?
[02:09:27.242 --> 02:09:28.963]  They're all bought and paid for.
[02:09:28.963 --> 02:09:30.525]  They're all owned by the same people.
[02:09:32.310 --> 02:09:34.592]  And, uh, we're not gonna talk about it here on the show.
[02:09:34.592 --> 02:09:37.495]  I mean, you're welcome to call in if you want, but it doesn't matter.
[02:09:37.495 --> 02:09:40.317]  Endless debates about, he said this, he said that.
[02:09:40.317 --> 02:09:47.384]  Did Barack Obama mean that, you know, by saying, uh, McCain's bearings are off, that that's code that he's old?
[02:09:47.384 --> 02:09:56.552]  Uh, it isn't that he's too old, it's that he's already had lymphoma cancer that 90% of the time comes back within 10 years and kills ya, and he had it 8 years ago.
[02:09:57.543 --> 02:09:59.545]  And he's had a couple other types of cancer.
[02:09:59.545 --> 02:10:01.346]  And the guy wants to bomb Iran.
[02:10:01.346 --> 02:10:03.628]  And he's a lunatic who's anti-gun.
[02:10:03.628 --> 02:10:08.152]  You know, they're announcing that the feds are going to give tuition to all the illegal aliens.
[02:10:08.152 --> 02:10:09.253]  Have you heard the latest?
[02:10:09.253 --> 02:10:10.334]  We're totally bankrupt.
[02:10:10.334 --> 02:10:11.375]  No future.
[02:10:11.375 --> 02:10:15.038]  Cops are out getting more tickets than ever as the states go bankrupt.
[02:10:15.038 --> 02:10:21.264]  Running around foaming at the mouth, feeding on us, mindless... I don't even hate them.
[02:10:21.264 --> 02:10:24.567]  They're just like a dumb squirrel running out in front of a car.
[02:10:26.121 --> 02:10:32.243]  I see all these petty nobodies, these men that think they're men.
[02:10:32.243 --> 02:10:40.386]  Maybe I shouldn't even be on the radio today.
[02:10:40.386 --> 02:10:41.207]  I just can't believe it.
[02:10:41.207 --> 02:10:42.827]  I'm living in a twilight zone.
[02:10:42.827 --> 02:10:48.969]  I am.
[02:10:48.969 --> 02:10:50.130]  We are change, Ohio.
[02:10:51.790 --> 02:11:16.982]  I'm gonna try to have them on, I'm told they got a bad cell phone, so who knows how long they'll be on, but let's just play a minute or so of them confronting Al Gore, that sack of trash, that piece of filth, that Viper King Viper, just oil company-owning trash liar scam artist, I mean, with all these well-meaning idiot college students getting taken to suckers one more time,
[02:11:18.061 --> 02:11:18.922]  You idiots!
[02:11:18.922 --> 02:11:28.189]  They had to choose a gas that was good so that none of the big corporations would actually have to cut back on any real toxic waste, you buffoons!
[02:11:28.189 --> 02:11:33.834]  Carbon dioxide is good, you jackasses!
[02:11:33.834 --> 02:11:47.325]  I mean, all these idiot young people working for McCain and working for Barack Obama and Hillary and all starry-eyed like you're doing something, all starry-eyed like you know how stuff works when you don't know anything!
[02:11:48.368 --> 02:11:58.554]  You know nothing!
[02:11:58.554 --> 02:11:59.975]  I'm one of the few sane people around.
[02:11:59.975 --> 02:12:00.956]  I'll tell you that right now.
[02:12:00.956 --> 02:12:01.856]  I know what all this is.
[02:12:01.856 --> 02:12:03.117]  This is a nightmare.
[02:12:03.117 --> 02:12:04.297]  This is hell.
[02:12:04.297 --> 02:12:05.618]  This totally freaks me out.
[02:12:05.618 --> 02:12:06.979]  It totally makes me mad.
[02:12:06.979 --> 02:12:13.743]  I've been robbed.
[02:12:13.743 --> 02:12:16.925]  And just the cowardly, soft, stupid public.
[02:12:17.776 --> 02:12:23.764]  With this group of sycophant backstabbing murderers sitting on top of you.
[02:12:23.764 --> 02:12:30.714]  And Prince Philip running around talking about how he wants to kill you and all these trillionaires and billionaires and yes there are trillionaires.
[02:12:31.383 --> 02:13:00.415]  Who just give all their money to eugenics and just love hurting us and dance with glee as young children die of leukemia and as children are imprisoned mentally for life with autism and all of it as they suck everything out of you and have their way with you, always winning, always getting it over on you, always having their way over and over again because you're focused on football and acting cool and driving fancy cars and strutting around with your idiot neighbors and co-workers.
[02:13:05.322 --> 02:13:08.403]  It's disgusting!
[02:13:08.403 --> 02:13:10.144]  But that's what Milk and Honey creates.
[02:13:10.144 --> 02:13:11.084]  That's what Plenty creates.
[02:13:11.084 --> 02:13:14.305]  You always turn into decadent slobs.
[02:13:14.305 --> 02:13:16.106]  We've all been decadent slobs.
[02:13:16.106 --> 02:13:22.528]  We've all gotten to be self-centered know-it-alls.
[02:13:22.528 --> 02:13:30.290]  And when I realize that I know more than 99% of people, and I still realize I don't know much, I don't have some big high and mighty view.
[02:13:30.290 --> 02:13:31.911]  I mean, that's what completely freaks me out.
[02:13:35.197 --> 02:13:40.181]  The neocons write letters to Iran saying we'll stage terror attacks in public newspapers.
[02:13:40.181 --> 02:13:45.945]  I mean, that's how obvious they are now?
[02:13:45.945 --> 02:13:50.288]  They write newspaper articles about how they want another 9-11, how great it is for them.
[02:13:50.288 --> 02:14:00.915]  I mean, these bastards are so arrogant and think so little of you that they write articles in the Philadelphia Daily News about how wonderful 9-11 is and how they can't wait till another one happens.
[02:14:00.915 --> 02:14:01.916]  That's their answer.
[02:14:06.994 --> 02:14:12.198]  To the Republican memos at the state and federal level coming out saying that they need to stage another attack.
[02:14:12.198 --> 02:14:19.184]  These bastards brag publicly about what they did to us.
[02:14:19.184 --> 02:14:29.233]  And then the idiot police will try to claim that they're going to plant bombs on We Are Change that's out at Building 7, exposing that it was an inside job.
[02:14:29.233 --> 02:14:33.096]  And they'll come over and billy club you, even when you have a permitted march.
[02:14:34.048 --> 02:14:38.491]  And they'll take all your freedoms away and laugh at you like dumb meatballs.
[02:14:38.491 --> 02:14:48.737]  When we were the ones the whole time exposing that you inhaled all that asbestos and are dying and now it's all come out that they knew and covered it all up and didn't give you any health care.
[02:14:48.737 --> 02:14:58.963]  And you'll sit there like a dumb dog whose master feeds it cyanide, licking the boots of the New World Order.
[02:14:58.963 --> 02:15:02.485]  Because you're a demon.
[02:15:02.485 --> 02:15:03.446]  You're a pig demon.
[02:15:05.953 --> 02:15:07.434]  You like it.
[02:15:07.434 --> 02:15:09.835]  You like how they hurt you.
[02:15:09.835 --> 02:15:16.438]  Hey, you don't care if they... poop all over you and rub it in.
[02:15:16.438 --> 02:15:19.500]  As long as you get to do it to us, isn't that really what it's all about?
[02:15:19.500 --> 02:15:23.542]  Isn't that what it's about, being trash and scum and weak?
[02:15:23.542 --> 02:15:27.324]  Isn't that what it's about, having little piggy eyes and a little piggy brain?
[02:15:27.324 --> 02:15:28.805]  I'm talking about the public.
[02:15:28.805 --> 02:15:31.566]  I don't even mean the pig sling for pigs for cops.
[02:15:31.566 --> 02:15:32.667]  I mean, we're pig people.
[02:15:33.744 --> 02:15:38.867]  Little piggy minds, little weak piggies.
[02:15:38.867 --> 02:15:42.989]  Play Al Gore, huh?
[02:15:42.989 --> 02:15:53.135]  We need to reduce carbon dioxide and we need to, we need the commitment on the part of the students to get involved.
[02:15:53.135 --> 02:15:57.998]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry sir, I'm trying to talk to these folks here.
[02:15:59.025 --> 02:16:01.067]  And I believe they want to hear what I have to say.
[02:16:01.067 --> 02:16:03.509]  Hey Al, we don't want your carbon tax!
[02:16:03.509 --> 02:16:06.091]  Planes need carbon dioxide debris!
[02:16:06.091 --> 02:16:07.693]  Come on, cut it out.
[02:16:07.693 --> 02:16:09.775]  We need to.
[02:16:09.775 --> 02:16:11.116]  Stop right there.
[02:16:11.116 --> 02:16:13.398]  Listen to that weak trash.
[02:16:13.398 --> 02:16:18.743]  They're worshipping Al Gore, that eugenics monster.
[02:16:18.743 --> 02:16:20.725]  Cut it out, oh cut it out.
[02:16:20.725 --> 02:16:24.388]  We're here to feel good about how we're all working together.
[02:16:25.734 --> 02:16:36.419]  You know, the government knows we're young people and we want to be involved in social change, so they've given us a false paradigm to waste ourselves in and to carry out eugenics murdering Africans.
[02:16:36.419 --> 02:16:41.241]  Of course, I'm too weak to ever face the facts, even if I knew how to look at the documents.
[02:16:41.241 --> 02:16:46.163]  I'm just gonna push eugenics and we're gonna run everything and tax everybody in the U.S.
[02:16:46.163 --> 02:16:52.186]  and new EnviroCops are gonna inspect all our homes and backyards and ranches and farms.
[02:16:52.186 --> 02:16:52.766]  Be quiet.
[02:16:52.766 --> 02:16:54.287]  Don't say that plants
[02:16:55.504 --> 02:16:58.805]  Want carbon dioxide to breathe?
[02:16:58.805 --> 02:16:59.765]  Just shut up!
[02:16:59.765 --> 02:17:01.146]  Go along with the fraud!
[02:17:01.146 --> 02:17:05.147]  You know, just like a neo-Connolese, be quiet!
[02:17:05.147 --> 02:17:08.228]  Don't say that Al-Qaeda isn't dangerous!
[02:17:08.228 --> 02:17:09.108]  Go along with it!
[02:17:09.108 --> 02:17:10.889]  We're all idiots here!
[02:17:10.889 --> 02:17:11.649]  Keep playing it!
[02:17:13.315 --> 02:17:21.184]  We need to reduce carbon dioxide, and we need to, we need a commitment on the part... That's how plants give us oxygen!
[02:17:21.184 --> 02:17:24.768]  They breathe in carbon dioxide and release oxygen!
[02:17:24.768 --> 02:17:29.072]  I'm sorry sir, I'm trying to talk to these folks here.
[02:17:29.072 --> 02:17:31.935]  And I believe they want to hear what I have to say.
[02:17:39.349 --> 02:17:44.575]  Go to WeCanSolveIt.org and let me conclude with this comment.
[02:17:44.575 --> 02:17:46.938]  I didn't buy a ticket to The Legend of Your Lives!
[02:17:46.938 --> 02:17:54.587]  Not too many years from now, the next generation will ask one of two questions.
[02:17:54.587 --> 02:17:56.769]  They'll look at the beginnings of the 21st century.
[02:17:57.996 --> 02:18:00.398]  It just goes on and on, folks.
[02:18:00.398 --> 02:18:02.960]  It is the biggest, sickest joke ever.
[02:18:02.960 --> 02:18:05.822]  That they're talking about banning carbon dioxide.
[02:18:05.822 --> 02:18:08.384]  Tell us what else happened from We Are Change Ohio.
[02:18:08.384 --> 02:18:08.984]  We got Sam
[02:18:26.565 --> 02:18:27.946]  Logaloo on with us.
[02:18:27.946 --> 02:18:32.130]  Sam, we're going to hold you over in the next segment, see if your cell phone's working okay.
[02:18:32.130 --> 02:18:42.058]  What was it like standing up against that con artist, that snake oil salesman, with that group of weak-minded cult members?
[02:18:46.866 --> 02:18:50.167]  Yeah, his phone was doing that earlier, so we just can't do the interview.
[02:18:50.167 --> 02:18:50.988]  Sam, I'm sorry.
[02:18:50.988 --> 02:18:53.149]  Some other day, when your phone works, we'll be able to do it.
[02:18:53.149 --> 02:18:54.869]  It doesn't even matter anymore.
[02:18:54.869 --> 02:18:58.231]  The people love $4-a-gallon gas.
[02:18:58.231 --> 02:18:59.851]  They love it!
[02:18:59.851 --> 02:19:01.352]  And they're gonna love it even more!
[02:19:01.352 --> 02:19:05.214]  Okay?
[02:19:05.214 --> 02:19:12.937]  Just, just, again, it's so insulting that they've got the public running around, cowering in fear of imaginary Al-Qaeda.
[02:19:14.159 --> 02:19:15.680]  And imaginary carbon dioxide.
[02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:21.402]  You can walk up to the very same people and tell, give them the name for salt.
[02:19:21.402 --> 02:19:22.263]  And they will say, ban it.
[02:19:22.263 --> 02:19:26.585]  Give them the name for water.
[02:19:26.585 --> 02:19:29.506]  And they will scream in fear.
[02:19:29.506 --> 02:19:32.047]  Just like they'll scream in fear of a citizen with a gun.
[02:19:32.047 --> 02:19:36.269]  But they love men in black uniforms and black masks stomping around.
[02:19:36.269 --> 02:19:38.250]  Oh, they feel so safe when they see that.
[02:19:38.250 --> 02:19:40.611]  Because all their common sense and instincts are gone.
[02:19:41.408 --> 02:19:45.575]  You're gonna be butchered like pigs by your masters, you understand?
[02:19:45.575 --> 02:19:49.962]  It is a big idea.
[02:19:51.112 --> 02:19:52.874]  A New World Order.
[02:19:52.874 --> 02:19:57.778]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:19:57.778 --> 02:20:00.601]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:20:00.601 --> 02:20:03.384]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:20:03.384 --> 02:20:06.587]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:20:06.587 --> 02:20:13.893]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:20:16.912 --> 02:20:22.373]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:20:22.373 --> 02:20:26.234]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:20:26.234 --> 02:20:28.795]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:20:28.795 --> 02:20:29.955]  Most people have no idea.
[02:20:29.955 --> 02:20:30.755]  They're not after money.
[02:20:30.755 --> 02:20:32.015]  They have all the money they need.
[02:20:32.015 --> 02:20:32.996]  They're after power.
[02:20:32.996 --> 02:20:34.156]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[02:21:53.311 --> 02:21:55.392]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:21:55.392 --> 02:21:58.814]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:21:58.814 --> 02:22:04.558]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.

[02:22:49.678 --> 02:22:52.980]  They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[02:22:52.980 --> 02:22:58.263]  Certainly we'd never intend to procrastinate getting our own food supply until there was none left at any price.
[02:22:58.263 --> 02:23:04.007]  We would intend to have plenty of food so the relief organizations could care for those unable to care for themselves.
[02:23:04.007 --> 02:23:11.612]  We would intend not to be standing in the breadline with the ignorant and the foolish who pretend the facts of food disappearance are untrue.
[02:23:11.612 --> 02:23:16.495]  If the experience of the Katrina disaster is evidence, the breadline may have no bread.
[02:23:17.114 --> 02:23:24.937]  Just like the good intentions on the road to that unheavenly place, the good intentions alone to get a supply of food will not feed us.
[02:23:24.937 --> 02:23:30.059]  Only getting our food supply immediately will make us independent and fearless for the future.
[02:23:30.059 --> 02:23:30.359]  Call 800-409-5633.
[02:23:30.359 --> 02:23:30.419]  800-409-5633.
[02:23:30.419 --> 02:23:31.359]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[02:23:31.359 --> 02:23:31.739]  Who am I?
[02:23:31.739 --> 02:23:31.879]  Nobody.
[02:23:31.879 --> 02:23:33.040]  Steve Schenck, Someone Who Cares.
[02:23:51.613 --> 02:23:54.614]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[02:23:54.614 --> 02:24:01.456]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:01.456 --> 02:24:07.398]  We use UPS to ship my books and videos that we sell out of the video bookstore, PrimfulWars.com.
[02:24:07.398 --> 02:24:18.822]  And just during the break, Weldon gave me the UPS quarterly magazine that they give us, The Power of Green.
[02:24:18.822 --> 02:24:20.263]  See, this is a whole global tax.
[02:24:22.086 --> 02:24:24.948]  And you can't run to FedEx, they're all pushing the same propaganda.
[02:24:24.948 --> 02:24:27.329]  This is just disgusting.
[02:24:27.329 --> 02:24:29.971]  And you use USPS, they're pushing it all too.
[02:24:29.971 --> 02:24:32.432]  We ship by them as well.
[02:24:32.432 --> 02:24:34.914]  And again, a lot of it sounds reasonable.
[02:24:34.914 --> 02:24:37.775]  They got all these smiling, well-meaning faces selling you the fraud.
[02:24:37.775 --> 02:24:39.816]  And it says, a green glossary.
[02:24:39.816 --> 02:24:41.697]  And we did get our guest, we'll go to him in a minute.
[02:24:41.697 --> 02:24:44.479]  You're going green, but you don't get the lingo.
[02:24:44.479 --> 02:24:47.941]  So you have to learn your new slave lingo.
[02:24:47.941 --> 02:24:49.502]  It starts with carbon dioxide.
[02:24:51.351 --> 02:24:54.174]  And it goes on to say, can increase the Earth's temperature.
[02:24:54.174 --> 02:24:56.036]  Here's a primer of terms.
[02:24:56.036 --> 02:25:01.602]  To learn more, go to compost.ups.com.
[02:25:01.602 --> 02:25:09.369]  It says carbon footprint, the amount of carbon dioxide emissions created by a person or business that they have to tax and regulate and commit crimes with.
[02:25:09.369 --> 02:25:10.330]  You have to be punished.
[02:25:10.330 --> 02:25:11.952]  Carbon tax.
[02:25:11.952 --> 02:25:13.614]  Oh, it's being introduced to us.
[02:25:14.898 --> 02:25:17.160]  And it says you're going green.
[02:25:17.160 --> 02:25:18.661]  See, it's like, oh, everyone's doing it.
[02:25:18.661 --> 02:25:20.742]  And the cattle go, oh, well, I'm doing it.
[02:25:20.742 --> 02:25:23.884]  I'm a idiot.
[02:25:23.884 --> 02:25:25.325]  A carbon tax.
[02:25:25.325 --> 02:25:30.128]  A proposed tax on emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
[02:25:30.128 --> 02:25:31.289]  Greenhouse gases.
[02:25:31.289 --> 02:25:32.230]  Water vapor.
[02:25:32.230 --> 02:25:35.472]  Oh, it's so deadly, water.
[02:25:35.472 --> 02:25:36.873]  Carbon dioxide.
[02:25:36.873 --> 02:25:37.734]  Oh, my God.
[02:25:37.734 --> 02:25:38.754]  Methane.
[02:25:38.754 --> 02:25:41.857]  Nitrous oxide allows sunlight to enter the atmosphere.
[02:25:43.553 --> 02:25:49.535]  The IPC, it teaches us our new master of our farms and ranches and everything they're now taking over.
[02:25:49.535 --> 02:25:58.538]  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an organization established to investigate climate change, its potential impact, and its options to reduce the risk.
[02:25:58.538 --> 02:26:04.860]  VOC's volatile organic compounds or chemical compounds creating carbon and can be harmful.
[02:26:05.723 --> 02:26:11.909]  Meanwhile, genetic engineering butchering everything, toxic waste everywhere, injecting you with biochemical weapons.
[02:26:11.909 --> 02:26:12.830]  Oh, die.
[02:26:12.830 --> 02:26:15.052]  Take your injections, will you, Genesis?
[02:26:15.052 --> 02:26:16.653]  Oh, you're an evil human.
[02:26:16.653 --> 02:26:17.915]  You exhale carbon.
[02:26:17.915 --> 02:26:19.036]  Oh, gosh, we're gonna get you.
[02:26:19.036 --> 02:26:19.556]  Don't worry.
[02:26:19.556 --> 02:26:23.099]  I mean, the head of the CFR says it's about making you the enemy.
[02:26:23.099 --> 02:26:25.782]  What do you think all these scheme-ass cops and cameras for?
[02:26:25.782 --> 02:26:26.963]  They're not for Al-Qaeda.
[02:26:26.963 --> 02:26:27.604]  They're for you.
[02:26:29.332 --> 02:26:30.452]  I shouldn't be doing the show today.
[02:26:30.452 --> 02:26:31.213]  I am so mad.
[02:26:31.213 --> 02:26:32.773]  I hate these people so much.
[02:26:32.773 --> 02:26:36.915]  They've got this poor little pathetic chicken neck here with this little hippie beard.
[02:26:36.915 --> 02:26:37.555]  Means well.
[02:26:37.555 --> 02:26:40.116]  He's got his little suit on, his little monkey outfit.
[02:26:40.116 --> 02:26:43.497]  It says, the employee parking lot at QBP.
[02:26:46.987 --> 02:26:49.249]  It says he's dominated by bikes.
[02:26:49.249 --> 02:26:52.692]  Ezra Taylor doesn't just pedal to work.
[02:26:52.692 --> 02:26:55.675]  He's a cross-cycling racing champion.
[02:26:55.675 --> 02:26:56.896]  See, it's all tailored.
[02:26:56.896 --> 02:26:59.538]  Ooh, you're a winner when you're involved with this.
[02:26:59.538 --> 02:27:01.399]  Ooh, he's a champion.
[02:27:01.399 --> 02:27:03.561]  Ooh, you're going green.
[02:27:03.561 --> 02:27:08.085]  Everything to comfort you as you're put into your new, strapped down your new control grid.
[02:27:08.085 --> 02:27:11.488]  Just like when you're breaking a horse.
[02:27:11.488 --> 02:27:14.230]  First they give you some grain and they put the bridle on.
[02:27:14.230 --> 02:27:15.491]  Shh, shh, it's okay, baby.
[02:27:16.195 --> 02:27:17.336]  Oh, here you go.
[02:27:17.336 --> 02:27:18.396]  Put the bit in your mouth.
[02:27:18.396 --> 02:27:21.717]  Now, let me walk you onto this little trailer here.
[02:27:21.717 --> 02:27:24.658]  We're gonna take you to a nice place where you're government.
[02:27:24.658 --> 02:27:28.220]  Let me just close the back panels, close the back doors.
[02:27:28.220 --> 02:27:30.020]  Let me just throw this bolt.
[02:27:30.020 --> 02:27:30.581]  Ha ha ha!
[02:27:30.581 --> 02:27:32.221]  Got you now, horse!
[02:27:32.221 --> 02:27:34.502]  You're going directly to the glue factory.
[02:27:34.502 --> 02:27:38.884]  We're gonna march you into a squeeze chute and hang you up by your legs and slit your throat.
[02:27:39.264 --> 02:27:42.186]  And then render you down into Elmer's glue.
[02:27:42.186 --> 02:27:45.248]  You go ahead and kick all you want on that door.
[02:27:45.248 --> 02:27:50.552]  When we get your guns, which is going to be very soon, we're going to have our way with you.
[02:27:50.552 --> 02:27:58.397]  You think we're just stopping with going into different colleges and telling people they can't talk about the Constitution or they'll be arrested?
[02:27:58.397 --> 02:27:59.678]  That's only the beginning.
[02:27:59.678 --> 02:28:03.040]  We're going to take your houses, your companies, everything you've got.
[02:28:03.040 --> 02:28:04.621]  We're hardcore criminals.
[02:28:04.621 --> 02:28:06.563]  We didn't join the team for nothing.
[02:28:07.703 --> 02:28:14.145]  Sure, I couldn't run a business or start a company or make a painting or make a film or take care of anybody.
[02:28:14.145 --> 02:28:24.349]  I'm a dirty dirtbag criminal, but I can put on a fancy black uniform with fancy black sunglasses and have you lick my boots and make me God over you.
[02:28:24.349 --> 02:28:28.310]  You understand, you filthy dirtbag trash?
[02:28:28.310 --> 02:28:30.091]  You cowardly scum!
[02:28:30.091 --> 02:28:33.332]  I'm running your life now, and I want to run it good!
[02:28:35.051 --> 02:28:35.892]  You know what I'm sick of?
[02:28:35.892 --> 02:28:42.918]  I'm sick of them all training us to be smiley and friendly and stupid and childlike to them while they have their way with us.
[02:28:42.918 --> 02:28:44.259]  It's time to get mad!
[02:28:44.259 --> 02:28:45.540]  It's time to get angry!
[02:28:45.540 --> 02:28:47.442]  Our ancestors weren't a bunch of wimps!
[02:28:47.442 --> 02:28:48.683]  They were vicious!
[02:28:48.683 --> 02:28:49.804]  They were strong!
[02:28:49.804 --> 02:28:51.685]  But they weren't into backstabbing.
[02:28:51.685 --> 02:28:52.987]  They weren't into cheating.
[02:28:52.987 --> 02:28:54.508]  They weren't into double dealing.
[02:28:54.508 --> 02:28:55.749]  They were adventurers.
[02:28:55.749 --> 02:28:57.030]  And they were builders.
[02:28:57.030 --> 02:28:58.551]  And they were trailblazers.
[02:28:58.551 --> 02:28:58.892]  They were...
[02:28:59.532 --> 02:29:00.533]  Explorers!
[02:29:00.533 --> 02:29:01.674]  They were fighters!
[02:29:01.674 --> 02:29:03.556]  They weren't what we've turned into now!
[02:29:03.556 --> 02:29:05.117]  A nation of filth!
[02:29:05.117 --> 02:29:06.659]  Trash everywhere!
[02:29:06.659 --> 02:29:13.064]  Let me be... I'm gonna let We Are Change comment on this.
[02:29:13.064 --> 02:29:14.045]  We got him with a good phone line.
[02:29:14.045 --> 02:29:16.768]  Apologize, I've been having to hold, but the phone was off when we went to him earlier.
[02:29:16.768 --> 02:29:21.512]  Now just look at this little leek piece of trash!
[02:29:38.682 --> 02:29:42.607]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:42.607 --> 02:29:45.291]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:30:48.649 --> 02:30:54.493]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[02:30:54.493 --> 02:30:59.936]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[02:30:59.936 --> 02:31:05.300]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[02:31:05.300 --> 02:31:11.223]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[02:31:11.223 --> 02:31:15.486]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life,
[02:31:15.686 --> 02:31:17.427]  Most people are overly acidic.
[02:31:17.427 --> 02:31:21.210]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[02:31:21.210 --> 02:31:26.034]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[02:31:26.034 --> 02:31:27.094]  Do your part.
[02:31:27.094 --> 02:31:29.716]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!
[02:31:29.716 --> 02:31:35.841]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink
[02:31:36.061 --> 02:31:41.247]  Hi, my name's Don Whiskin and for over 7 years I've been telling people about Cardivite.
[02:31:41.247 --> 02:31:44.730]  Here's Dr. John Matson, a naturopathic doctor, and his views on Cardivite.
[02:31:57.626 --> 02:32:02.187]  Thank you, Don, for making my job so much easier because your products just make it so simple, right?
[02:32:02.187 --> 02:32:07.968]  To fool around with a lot of exotic things that don't work, we can just put them on cardivite and things start to work almost right away.
[02:32:07.968 --> 02:32:16.389]  I've had dozens and dozens of patients with heart problems who have corrected them and what it's doing, there's so much garlic in there that has a yeast killing effect.
[02:32:16.389 --> 02:32:19.370]  That yeast is a big problem in the gut, pushes the liver hard.
[02:32:19.370 --> 02:32:24.371]  It also has metal chelating effect and most of the other herbs in there I find that strengthen the arteries.
[02:32:24.371 --> 02:32:26.151]  They help to neutralize free radicals.
[02:32:26.351 --> 02:32:31.494]  Your remedy is as close to what we do in our program as you can get as far as one supplement goes.
[02:32:31.494 --> 02:32:35.616]  It's working on the gut, it's working on the liver, it's working on the arteries.
[02:32:35.616 --> 02:32:36.897]  What more can you ask for?
[02:32:36.897 --> 02:32:40.259]  To learn more call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at heartdrop.com.
[02:32:40.259 --> 02:32:41.660]  That's H-E-A-R-T-D-R-O-P dot com.
[02:32:54.229 --> 02:32:56.810]  You wanna know how I really feel when I think about these people?
[02:32:56.810 --> 02:32:59.471]  That's really who I am.
[02:32:59.471 --> 02:33:03.873]  I know, it's embarrassing.
[02:33:03.873 --> 02:33:05.633]  But it's like a ship bulkhead.
[02:33:05.633 --> 02:33:10.895]  We're in a submarine on the bottom, it's engines broken down, we're waiting on rescue.
[02:33:10.895 --> 02:33:13.216]  We don't know if it's coming.
[02:33:13.216 --> 02:33:17.658]  And behind that door is millions of pounds of pressure.
[02:33:17.658 --> 02:33:19.939]  And that bulkhead door is straining, there's a leak in it.
[02:33:22.728 --> 02:33:23.569]  That's the globalist.
[02:33:23.569 --> 02:33:29.874]  I mean, just scum of the earth, want to kill us, already killing us with soft kill weapons, setting up eugenics.
[02:33:29.874 --> 02:33:35.259]  You know, this UPS thing should read, it says, how is green, how green is your business?
[02:33:35.259 --> 02:33:37.040]  Take our quiz.
[02:33:37.040 --> 02:33:39.663]  It should read, how enslaved is your business?
[02:33:39.663 --> 02:33:45.508]  Are you going to help us shut you down and roll you into the new world order with a new global eugenics world government tax?
[02:33:47.594 --> 02:33:48.835]  But see, it isn't honest with people.
[02:33:48.835 --> 02:34:03.389]  It's all PR, all about looking calm, all about being passive, making you lay down, making you think everything's okay, making you think everything's alright, everything's friendly, making you think you're a stakeholder and what you think's really being listened to.
[02:34:03.389 --> 02:34:06.552]  Meanwhile, they build giant prisons and arm police as fast as they can.
[02:34:07.981 --> 02:34:10.924]  I mean, and right behind that door is the host of hell.
[02:34:10.924 --> 02:34:12.525]  And I watch them steal people's kids.
[02:34:12.525 --> 02:34:14.406]  I mean, I've been there and covered it, folks.
[02:34:14.406 --> 02:34:15.547]  I've seen them torture people.
[02:34:15.547 --> 02:34:16.747]  I've seen them get away with their evil.
[02:34:16.747 --> 02:34:18.489]  I am a person who has feelings.
[02:34:18.489 --> 02:34:21.211]  I'm a person who has a lot of love.
[02:34:21.211 --> 02:34:28.756]  And then at an animal level, I just literally just am so mad at the weak public being so stupid.
[02:34:28.756 --> 02:34:30.977]  Do you have any idea who you're dealing with here?
[02:34:30.977 --> 02:34:35.620]  Do you know what they're gonna do to you?
[02:34:35.620 --> 02:34:36.281]  Let's go to Sam.
[02:34:37.478 --> 02:34:46.552]  Logalo of We Are Change, Ohio, who confronted Lord Gore, who is just the biggest snake oil con, just a total piece of trash.
[02:34:47.905 --> 02:35:02.411]  Up there, all the science shows carbon dioxide is 700 years after the warming, and that it's good, and it's just we're in an oxygen and carbon dioxide starved environment in this earth cycle.
[02:35:02.411 --> 02:35:03.371]  But I'm going to shut up.
[02:35:03.371 --> 02:35:05.992]  I mean, always being there, you see more than what happened.
[02:35:05.992 --> 02:35:06.832]  The video's great.
[02:35:06.832 --> 02:35:08.173]  I salute you.
[02:35:08.173 --> 02:35:10.354]  Sorry we had to have you on hold when your phone was out earlier.
[02:35:10.354 --> 02:35:12.174]  Tell me anything else you want to add.
[02:35:14.798 --> 02:35:20.281]  Yeah, Al Gore was in Columbus and we drove up there to confront him.
[02:35:20.281 --> 02:35:23.582]  I'm the guy screaming in the video.
[02:35:23.582 --> 02:35:26.043]  You did a great job, by the way.
[02:35:26.043 --> 02:35:26.444]  Thank you.
[02:35:26.444 --> 02:35:30.446]  Well, I'll tell you, up close, isn't he just a sack of maggot guts?
[02:35:30.446 --> 02:35:33.567]  Isn't he just a pile of evil?
[02:35:33.567 --> 02:35:34.528]  You can see it in his face.
[02:35:34.528 --> 02:35:36.388]  Oh, he's a real piece of crap.
[02:35:36.388 --> 02:35:36.909]  I'm sorry.
[02:35:36.909 --> 02:35:40.751]  The way he talks and the way he looks are totally different.
[02:35:40.751 --> 02:35:42.932]  I mean, he looks purely evil when you look in his face.
[02:35:44.935 --> 02:35:46.496]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:35:46.496 --> 02:35:52.801]  Yeah, so then we went outside, I handed out some literature, and we got the banner out.
[02:35:52.801 --> 02:35:55.123]  Brad made a very nice banner.
[02:35:55.123 --> 02:35:57.425]  No carbon tax at the scam.
[02:35:57.425 --> 02:36:03.690]  And then we talked to the people coming out, and even talked to a few reporters.
[02:36:03.690 --> 02:36:06.832]  And that's really all I can remember right now on the Gore event.
[02:36:06.832 --> 02:36:10.395]  Now tell me about the little brainwashed slaves of death.
[02:36:11.633 --> 02:36:12.153]  That's what they are.
[02:36:12.153 --> 02:36:13.834]  They love Prince Philip.
[02:36:13.834 --> 02:36:19.558]  They love dead black babies and dead Latin American babies and love their mommy dying of engineered cancer.
[02:36:19.558 --> 02:36:21.339]  Tell me about the lovers of death!
[02:36:21.339 --> 02:36:23.700]  Tell me about their weakness!
[02:36:23.700 --> 02:36:25.941]  Yeah, they showed up to a public event.
[02:36:25.941 --> 02:36:27.162]  They just wanted to watch TV.
[02:36:27.162 --> 02:36:30.664]  You know, you interrupt Al Gore and it's like, shut up, you know, I'm watching this TV here.
[02:36:30.664 --> 02:36:33.165]  It's all about them feeling like they're part of something big.
[02:36:33.165 --> 02:36:37.528]  Yeah, they feel real important.
[02:36:37.528 --> 02:36:38.248]  I didn't know they stacked
[02:36:40.504 --> 02:36:43.788]  Excrement that high, but tell me what else they were doing.
[02:36:43.788 --> 02:36:48.615]  Well, inside there, they were telling us to shut up and whatnot.
[02:36:48.615 --> 02:36:50.998]  They didn't like us interrupting their guide.
[02:36:50.998 --> 02:36:54.122]  Then outside, there was a few of them just didn't want to hear it.
[02:36:54.122 --> 02:36:56.004]  You know, this is BS.
[02:36:56.004 --> 02:36:57.767]  Then they'd hop on their bikes and pedal away.
[02:36:58.948 --> 02:37:00.029]  There's nothing wrong with bikes.
[02:37:00.029 --> 02:37:02.771]  There's nothing wrong with getting out of the mall culture.
[02:37:02.771 --> 02:37:12.258]  What the globalists designed us is a sprawling, based on the automobile, and now they're going to cheat us and choke us and wreck our economy and bring in total control in their own admission.
[02:37:12.258 --> 02:37:15.201]  I mean, I saw you out there with that huge sign saying no carbon tax.
[02:37:15.201 --> 02:37:24.087]  Did you explain to the idiots that, I noticed you did, that hey, carbon dioxide's good, this covers up for all the real environmental issues?
[02:37:24.087 --> 02:37:28.531]  Oh yeah, yeah, and in fact, they mentioned that to us several times.
[02:37:29.258 --> 02:37:32.561]  See that's what makes me even madder, is that we have real environmental problems, and it's hurting us!
[02:37:32.561 --> 02:37:35.543]  I mean, I care about the Earth, but forget the Earth, it's hurting me!
[02:37:53.792 --> 02:37:55.393]  We're all interconnected.
[02:37:55.393 --> 02:37:58.334]  And they're doing stuff, it's irreversibly bad.
[02:37:58.334 --> 02:38:01.235]  I mean, they've done... It's just so out of control.
[02:38:01.235 --> 02:38:05.417]  Meanwhile, they've got all these idiots calling for global government and a global tax.
[02:38:05.417 --> 02:38:06.477]  Well, I just commend you.
[02:38:06.477 --> 02:38:08.038]  He's getting confronted everywhere.
[02:38:08.038 --> 02:38:11.660]  He looked like he got upset when you spoke up to him.
[02:38:11.660 --> 02:38:13.400]  Uh, yeah, I think he stumbled a little bit.
[02:38:13.400 --> 02:38:19.043]  He was a little distracted when I interrupted him.
[02:38:19.043 --> 02:38:21.484]  Yeah, he wanted to continue preaching to his flock there.
[02:38:22.128 --> 02:38:25.270]  Is there a We Are Change Ohio website?
[02:38:25.270 --> 02:38:26.210]  Yes.
[02:38:26.210 --> 02:38:28.191]  Type in We Are Change Ohio.
[02:38:28.191 --> 02:38:34.735]  You can go to the regular WeAreChange.org website, and it's linked there.
[02:38:34.735 --> 02:38:39.637]  I didn't hear this on the video, but let me guess.
[02:38:39.637 --> 02:38:45.140]  Did some of these chicken necks tell you you were funded by the oil companies?
[02:38:45.140 --> 02:38:48.442]  One guy did walk by and he said, yeah, how much are you being paid to do this?
[02:38:51.249 --> 02:38:55.632]  That's really all I remember, specifically.
[02:38:55.632 --> 02:38:56.853]  Well, anything else you want to add?
[02:38:56.853 --> 02:38:59.775]  We can just commend you, Sam, and others from We Are Change Ohio.
[02:38:59.775 --> 02:39:00.876]  Anything else?
[02:39:00.876 --> 02:39:07.761]  Yeah, I'm also with another group, if you're in the Cincinnati area, Cincinnati 9-11 Truth.
[02:39:07.761 --> 02:39:11.403]  We are for real, you know, just like We Are Change Ohio.
[02:39:11.403 --> 02:39:16.107]  How do people get in touch with you and join the team?
[02:39:16.107 --> 02:39:17.347]  cincincy911.org.
[02:39:22.385 --> 02:39:26.828]  Alright, I really commend you, and thank you for spending time with us today, sir, and keep it up.
[02:39:26.828 --> 02:39:27.868]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:39:27.868 --> 02:39:28.249]  You bet.
[02:39:28.249 --> 02:39:42.377]  Yeah, going to their little staged events, their little communal bloodletting events, as we learn how bad humans are and learn that government has to organize us around attacking ourselves, and that's official.
[02:39:42.377 --> 02:39:44.979]  It's so ridiculous, the carbon... I mean, I just...
[02:39:47.129 --> 02:39:49.072]  Again, it's a sick joke with these people.
[02:39:49.072 --> 02:39:50.033]  Everything is a sick joke.
[02:39:50.033 --> 02:39:51.995]  We're going to G. Everett Griffin in a minute.
[02:39:51.995 --> 02:39:57.321]  I do want to tell listeners that I'm going to be showing my new film, 9-11 Chronicles Part 1.
[02:39:57.321 --> 02:40:00.665]  Truth Rising is the name of the film, but it's 9-11 Chronicles Part 1, Truth Rising.
[02:40:00.665 --> 02:40:03.368]  The short title, Truth Rising.
[02:40:03.368 --> 02:40:07.033]  Every film I make, I say this is the best, but if you watch them, each one just gets better.
[02:40:08.148 --> 02:40:11.130]  But this really is different.
[02:40:11.130 --> 02:40:13.972]  I mean, and it is the best I've made entertainment-wise.
[02:40:13.972 --> 02:40:16.193]  I mean, it's also very informative.
[02:40:16.193 --> 02:40:25.038]  I mean, we spent 20 minutes of the two hours on how they blew up the towers and how it was an inside job with some incredible eyewitness testimony, emergency workers and others.
[02:40:25.038 --> 02:40:36.825]  But not just that, it's David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski and Larry Silverstein and Bill Clinton and Hillary and John McCain and Barack Obama and
[02:40:38.763 --> 02:40:39.323]  All of them.
[02:40:39.323 --> 02:40:41.464]  I mean, Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[02:40:41.464 --> 02:40:46.206]  All of them being confronted instead of watching some cruddy YouTube video.
[02:40:46.206 --> 02:40:49.727]  I mean, this is high quality, big screen with stuff you've never seen.
[02:40:49.727 --> 02:40:54.129]  And high def footage we shot in New York in the last three years of remembrances there.
[02:40:54.129 --> 02:40:56.490]  And emergency workers and what the dust really did.
[02:40:56.490 --> 02:40:59.851]  And their trip to Washington to try to get healthcare and that being blocked.
[02:40:59.851 --> 02:41:01.552]  And that we are change funded.
[02:41:02.091 --> 02:41:12.709]  I mean, these are kids running this that literally live in one-room apartments and wear the same shirt all week, and they raised all this money and paid for it, and then they were about to get it passed in Washington, and they just said, no funding.
[02:41:15.026 --> 02:41:15.907]  The fight goes on.
[02:41:15.907 --> 02:41:19.809]  I mean, it's just an incredible film, and I'll be showing that coming up this Saturday.
[02:41:19.809 --> 02:41:22.170]  And by the way, there's not going to be 10 showings like there usually is in Austin.
[02:41:22.170 --> 02:41:26.213]  I'm doing two showings, and then we may tweak the film, change a few things in it.
[02:41:26.213 --> 02:41:27.814]  There's also a screening.
[02:41:27.814 --> 02:41:29.755]  This won't be out for about two months.
[02:41:29.755 --> 02:41:31.776]  There's going to be a showing this Saturday, 3.30.
[02:41:31.776 --> 02:41:35.259]  It's a matinee at the Alamo Draft House.
[02:41:35.259 --> 02:41:39.141]  They're on 6th Street.
[02:41:39.141 --> 02:41:40.882]  It's the new Ritz.
[02:41:40.882 --> 02:41:42.363]  It's really nice, what's called the Ritz.
[02:41:42.910 --> 02:41:43.710]  That's not that fancy.
[02:41:43.710 --> 02:41:44.611]  You don't wear a tie or anything.
[02:41:44.611 --> 02:41:45.031]  But you know what?
[02:41:45.031 --> 02:41:45.771]  I mean, it's nice.
[02:41:45.771 --> 02:41:46.432]  It's called the Ritz.
[02:41:46.432 --> 02:41:48.052]  Alamo Draft House Ritz downtown.
[02:41:48.052 --> 02:41:51.074]  And then Sunday at 6.30 after the Sonny Radio Show.
[02:41:51.074 --> 02:41:52.935]  I hope everybody will be there.
[02:41:52.935 --> 02:41:57.777]  All of our showings have always sold out until I had 12 showings last time, and then two of them didn't sell out.
[02:41:57.777 --> 02:42:01.139]  But, you know, when we have two showings, they always sell out.
[02:42:01.139 --> 02:42:02.439]  We have six showings, they always sell out.
[02:42:02.439 --> 02:42:03.740]  We had eight showings, they always sold out.
[02:42:03.740 --> 02:42:06.061]  But 98% of our showings sell out.
[02:42:06.061 --> 02:42:07.482]  That's a good way to put it.
[02:42:07.482 --> 02:42:09.663]  You'll want to get tickets now so you don't get turned away at the door.
[02:42:10.583 --> 02:42:13.986]  We'll let you know Friday, you know, if there's any tickets left.
[02:42:13.986 --> 02:42:15.127]  If you do want to try to show up.
[02:42:15.127 --> 02:42:16.047]  A little secret.
[02:42:16.047 --> 02:42:18.929]  They always hold like 15-20 tickets back for people at the door.
[02:42:18.929 --> 02:42:21.151]  So if you're going to be at the door, be there first.
[02:42:21.151 --> 02:42:25.635]  But go to InfoWars.com and link through or pull up on 6th Street at the Alamo Draft House.
[02:42:25.635 --> 02:42:27.456]  You can buy your tickets now.
[02:42:27.456 --> 02:42:30.238]  And 3.30 on Saturday and 6.30 on Sunday.
[02:42:30.238 --> 02:42:32.840]  And I'll give a 30-minute speech at each event.
[02:42:32.840 --> 02:42:35.722]  And that's basically it.
[02:42:35.722 --> 02:42:36.663]  I hope to see you down there.
[02:42:37.927 --> 02:42:49.898]  Okay, also, this radio show is possible, is made possible by you purchasing books and videos, not just the films I've made or the book I've written, but the books I've published and the books and videos we carry at InfoWars.com.
[02:42:49.898 --> 02:42:51.900]  The best titles out there, bar none.
[02:42:51.900 --> 02:42:55.363]  The new films we're covering are American Drug War, it's got the Fed so upset they
[02:42:56.073 --> 02:42:58.835]  Rated Tommy Chung for basically being in it.
[02:42:58.835 --> 02:43:01.237]  I consulted on that, and I'm in the extras on that.
[02:43:01.237 --> 02:43:03.979]  It's got three hours of extras and a two-hour film.
[02:43:03.979 --> 02:43:04.680]  Five hours, $19.95.
[02:43:04.680 --> 02:43:09.143]  It's really like five films in one for $19.95.
[02:43:09.143 --> 02:43:10.304]  Matt Washington, you're fired.
[02:43:10.304 --> 02:43:13.547]  William Lewis's new film available at InfoWars.com.
[02:43:13.547 --> 02:43:16.129]  Endgame blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:43:16.129 --> 02:43:18.250]  Loose change final cut.
[02:43:18.250 --> 02:43:20.953]  They're all available at InfoWars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.

[02:44:30.065 --> 02:44:32.767]  Also, there is Aloe Ease.
[02:44:32.767 --> 02:44:34.149]  That's one of hundreds of products.
[02:44:34.149 --> 02:44:37.812]  The fine folks at New Vitality, one of the oldest, most respected
[02:44:38.408 --> 02:44:46.940]  Nutrition companies out there, no magic claims, no silver bullets, just high quality stuff that's well known, like aloe, yeast, colon, and body cleanse.
[02:44:46.940 --> 02:44:49.223]  Aloe vera is well known for flushing your guts out.
[02:44:49.858 --> 02:44:54.800]  And really getting those toxins out of there, and a lot of medical studies on that, and that's one of their main products.
[02:44:54.800 --> 02:44:54.960]  1-800-569-4056.
[02:44:54.960 --> 02:44:55.941]  Big banner up on InfoWars.com.
[02:44:55.941 --> 02:44:56.021]  1-800-569-4056.
[02:44:56.021 --> 02:44:59.122]  They've also got Super Beta Prostate, well-known combination of herbs for your prostate.
[02:44:59.122 --> 02:44:59.202]  1-800-569-4056.
[02:44:59.202 --> 02:45:00.763]  Now let's go ahead and go to G. Edward Griffin.
[02:45:14.508 --> 02:45:19.510]  He'll be with us, and I appreciate him holding the last five minutes, he'll be with us until the end of the show today.
[02:45:19.510 --> 02:45:25.912]  And I thought we'd do a part two and mainly take calls and talk more about solutions today.
[02:45:25.912 --> 02:45:38.696]  But with all the things happening in the news, the fake election, the three-stage candidates, I thought I'd bring up that, not to cover it because it's a distraction, but to use it as a learning module to see how they stage events
[02:45:39.116 --> 02:45:50.448]  So I thought out of the first curveball I'd throw him would be getting his take on Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and John McCain and to get his take on this whole exercise in futility.
[02:45:50.448 --> 02:45:52.971]  We had so much fun when he was in a few weeks ago in studio.
[02:45:53.720 --> 02:45:54.321]  Well Alex, thanks.
[02:45:54.321 --> 02:45:55.201]  It's good to be here.
[02:45:55.201 --> 02:45:55.822]  Oh, yes indeed.
[02:45:55.822 --> 02:45:58.784]  My boy, you really cover the waterfront here, and we got a response.
[02:45:58.784 --> 02:46:00.906]  They're still coming in from that, and I appreciate that so much.
[02:46:16.819 --> 02:46:19.260]  Uh, are realistic, focused, and serious.
[02:46:19.260 --> 02:46:22.521]  In some cases, more so than me, because I just can't handle it anymore.
[02:46:22.521 --> 02:46:28.283]  I flip out sometimes and try to push people to good places where they can, uh, move forward.
[02:46:28.283 --> 02:46:30.104]  And I always like how you're classy.
[02:46:30.104 --> 02:46:31.865]  Have you seen the disease in our movement?
[02:46:31.865 --> 02:46:43.469]  How, over time, most people turn into backstabbers who are about egos and who the big dog is on the block instead of realizing we're on a ship in very treacherous waters in an emergency situation?
[02:46:44.669 --> 02:46:46.850]  Yes, I have noticed that, Alex.
[02:46:46.850 --> 02:46:49.451]  I don't know whether that's peculiar to our movement.
[02:46:49.451 --> 02:46:50.491]  I think not.
[02:46:50.491 --> 02:46:56.133]  It's probably peculiar to any group of people who get together and all of us.
[02:46:56.133 --> 02:46:58.074]  They start off all in lockstep.
[02:46:58.074 --> 02:46:59.995]  They've got the same goals, the same ideas.
[02:47:00.771 --> 02:47:02.132]  It's very destructive.
[02:47:02.132 --> 02:47:08.398]  We need to stay focused on key issues we can stop, like the fact that global warming is a global carbon tax fraud.
[02:47:08.398 --> 02:47:09.540]  But before we get into the election,
[02:47:20.295 --> 02:47:27.481]  Since I raised that point, people say Ron Paul is a blood-drinking Mason.
[02:47:27.481 --> 02:47:44.014]  Their proof is that he spoke at Harvard or something and there was a Masonic seal behind him where he spoke, and that he doesn't bash Masons when that's a huge constituency and most Masons aren't bad and are compartmentalized and don't realize that the higher levels it has been used for the program.
[02:47:44.014 --> 02:47:44.254]  You see,
[02:47:44.834 --> 02:47:48.538]  But oh no, there's a masonic seal in one speech he gave of thousands.
[02:47:48.538 --> 02:47:54.423]  It's all over, Ron Paul's a devil, and I won't expose him for being a devil now, so I'm evil too, G. Edward Griffin!
[02:47:54.423 --> 02:47:58.848]  Yeah, well, I think you and I are in the same team.
[02:47:58.848 --> 02:48:08.557]  I don't know whether Ron Paul is a mason or not, I doubt it very much, but even if he were, I don't think he would be one of those guys that we're concerned about at the top, 33 degree or higher.
[02:48:10.290 --> 02:48:20.768]  Uh, your point is so well taken that 99% of the Masons, at least the ones I know, are just good old boys and they have no concept of the history of the
[02:48:21.440 --> 02:48:25.422]  Of the lodges and, you know, the origins in Europe.
[02:48:25.422 --> 02:48:32.826]  And that helps the New World Order when people unfairly attack all Masons and say, you're worshipping Baphomet.
[02:48:32.826 --> 02:48:34.347]  They haven't read Albert Pike.
[02:48:34.347 --> 02:48:35.828]  They haven't read Morals and Dogma.
[02:48:35.828 --> 02:48:37.769]  They haven't read Manly P. Hall.
[02:48:37.769 --> 02:48:39.489]  And so they think these people are nuts.
[02:48:39.489 --> 02:48:41.210]  They're saying, I'm a devil worshipper.
[02:48:41.210 --> 02:48:43.432]  Instead of approaching them and saying, did you see this?
[02:48:43.432 --> 02:48:44.452]  Did you know this?
[02:48:44.452 --> 02:48:47.754]  Again, you aid the evil by being off the hook nuts.
[02:48:48.234 --> 02:48:48.694]  Yeah.
[02:48:48.694 --> 02:48:58.461]  Well, you know, I think that the ugly reality, Alex, is that our enemies are very well aware of this tendency, and I think they fuel it.
[02:48:58.461 --> 02:49:05.446]  I think there are enjamb provocateurs in our midst whose sole job is to get our people going down the wrong track.
[02:49:06.394 --> 02:49:08.395]  And it's, unfortunately, pretty easy at times.
[02:49:25.066 --> 02:49:29.267]  It makes me sick at an intellectual level, because we're in a desperate situation.
[02:49:29.267 --> 02:49:44.732]  We've got to use every ounce of our energy to stay focused on real issues and to wake the public up to the general basics, instead of automatically arguing with them about the secret triumphant of, you know, the Gettys, the Pope, and Sherlock Holmes.
[02:49:44.732 --> 02:49:45.912]  I'm being sarcastic.
[02:49:45.912 --> 02:49:48.853]  I mean, I'd like you to speak on that.
[02:49:48.853 --> 02:49:52.274]  We're about to go to break, and then on the election, and then whatever you want to talk about.
[02:49:52.274 --> 02:49:53.074]  Okay, very good.
[02:49:53.672 --> 02:50:07.776]  Well, like our last session together, Alex, I find that with the way you pose the question to me and you cover the topic so well that there's not much for me to say except, yeah, what you said.
[02:50:07.776 --> 02:50:08.996]  You say it so well.
[02:50:08.996 --> 02:50:10.417]  Oh, I do not.
[02:50:10.417 --> 02:50:10.937]  You do.
[02:50:10.937 --> 02:50:12.017]  I'll watch the interview later.
[02:50:12.017 --> 02:50:13.538]  You're much more eloquent than I, but go ahead.
[02:50:13.538 --> 02:50:20.019]  Well, I don't know about that, but anyway, I'll start off by saying yes, I agree in my own thoughts.
[02:50:20.019 --> 02:50:22.340]  I'll just repeat that I know that our enemies
[02:50:22.936 --> 02:50:23.836]  It is a big idea
[02:50:51.539 --> 02:50:53.300]  A New World Order.
[02:50:53.300 --> 02:50:58.203]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:50:58.203 --> 02:51:01.045]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:51:01.045 --> 02:51:03.826]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:51:03.826 --> 02:51:07.008]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:51:07.008 --> 02:51:14.333]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:51:17.358 --> 02:51:22.784]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:51:22.784 --> 02:51:26.688]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:51:26.688 --> 02:51:29.231]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:51:29.231 --> 02:51:30.392]  Most people have no idea.
[02:51:30.392 --> 02:51:31.193]  They're not after money.
[02:51:31.193 --> 02:51:32.454]  They have all the money they need.
[02:51:32.454 --> 02:51:33.455]  They're after power.
[02:51:33.455 --> 02:51:34.596]  That's what they're after.

[02:51:46.119 --> 02:51:47.282]  You have been warned.
[02:51:49.488 --> 02:51:55.550]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[02:51:55.550 --> 02:52:01.492]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high stress lifestyles.
[02:52:01.492 --> 02:52:05.653]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[02:52:05.653 --> 02:52:10.094]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized
[02:52:10.274 --> 02:52:11.195]  We're good to go!
[02:52:34.793 --> 02:52:39.120]  Let SnyderHealth.com provide the water ionizer that's right for you and your family.

[02:52:48.513 --> 02:52:52.035]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:52:52.035 --> 02:52:57.437]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[02:52:57.437 --> 02:53:02.600]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[02:53:02.600 --> 02:53:13.705]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[02:53:14.105 --> 02:53:19.888]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:53:19.888 --> 02:53:26.152]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[02:53:26.152 --> 02:53:27.192]  What about you?

[02:54:01.860 --> 02:54:06.581]  G. Edward Griffiths, our guest, Freedom Force International.
[02:54:31.817 --> 02:54:35.120]  We'll be opening up the phones next hour at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:54:35.120 --> 02:54:46.808]  Also, this fourth hour, as always, is going to be simulcast via television on the web for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[02:54:46.808 --> 02:54:50.952]  Also, it goes out in, what is it, 64K or 56?
[02:54:50.952 --> 02:54:54.795]  It's better audio, I know that.
[02:54:54.795 --> 02:54:55.515]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:54:58.365 --> 02:55:01.348]  Yeah, but you're very gentile, very intelligent, very calm about this.
[02:55:01.348 --> 02:55:05.593]  I know we talked last time about how I tend to freak out, and you said when you were younger you would.
[02:55:05.593 --> 02:55:08.135]  It's just they're so diabolical.
[02:55:08.135 --> 02:55:09.056]  They're so evil.
[02:55:09.056 --> 02:55:11.679]  They're doing so many bad things.
[02:55:11.679 --> 02:55:12.460]  I just panic.
[02:55:12.460 --> 02:55:13.621]  I want people to stop them.
[02:55:13.621 --> 02:55:14.302]  I want to fight them.
[02:55:15.092 --> 02:55:29.702]  And I know that you've got, you know, an approach to do that, but continuing with how they try to get us to run off rabbit trails to where the general public, when they first hear what we're talking about, thinks we're talking gibberish instead of putting the basics out to people.
[02:55:29.702 --> 02:55:35.466]  Speak to that, then to the election, then to solutions, what you think of the food shortages, anything you want to talk about.
[02:55:35.466 --> 02:55:41.771]  Well, I think probably the most common example that everybody would recognize
[02:55:42.481 --> 02:55:46.023]  Uh, in this business of sending us down rabbit trails.
[02:55:46.023 --> 02:55:56.389]  Uh, anybody that spends any time at all on their email inbox knows that about every, oh, I guess about every five or six weeks, uh, we get an alert from somebody out there.
[02:55:56.389 --> 02:56:00.792]  We never heard of this person before, but there's this alert that, stand by everybody, listen to this.
[02:56:00.792 --> 02:56:01.572]  You got to read this.
[02:56:01.572 --> 02:56:02.353]  This is urgent.
[02:56:02.353 --> 02:56:11.538]  Tell all your friends, uh, inside source, a reliable source tells us that next Tuesday is the big day for an atomic attack against an American city.
[02:56:12.188 --> 02:56:15.230]  Or stand by on May 14th.
[02:56:15.230 --> 02:56:16.790]  We know this for certain now.
[02:56:16.790 --> 02:56:22.313]  May 14th is the day they're going to unleash a bacteriological attack in Chicago.
[02:56:22.313 --> 02:56:23.934]  And tell your friends, you know, the sort of thing.
[02:56:23.934 --> 02:56:26.095]  You get that about every six weeks.
[02:56:26.095 --> 02:56:27.396]  And who are these people?
[02:56:27.396 --> 02:56:29.017]  Where does this come from?
[02:56:29.017 --> 02:56:30.758]  You know, this doesn't just happen.
[02:56:30.758 --> 02:56:32.779]  This is manufactured stuff.
[02:56:32.779 --> 02:56:39.402]  And the whole purpose is to get Johnny Gullible to go along and send it to all of his friends.
[02:56:39.798 --> 02:56:40.941]  Because he's really concerned.
[02:56:40.941 --> 02:56:46.896]  You know, he thinks this could be the real thing, and God knows it could be the real thing at some day, so that they got you there, you know?
[02:56:47.715 --> 02:56:55.898]  But he sends it to all of his friends, and they get excited, and then the date comes and passes, and they think, well, so much for Johnny, he's just a jerk.
[02:56:55.898 --> 02:57:09.523]  And that way, if a real warning ever comes out, people would have heard Wolf cried so much they won't take action, and that way people never do take action, because it's all the world's always ending next week, instead of it's ongoing tyranny.
[02:57:09.523 --> 02:57:13.365]  Martial law isn't coming, we're already in to a certain degree of it.
[02:57:13.365 --> 02:57:13.645]  Go ahead.
[02:57:13.985 --> 02:57:14.686]  Well, that's right.
[02:57:14.686 --> 02:57:18.548]  And then people ask me all the time, when do you think the New World Order is going to be here?
[02:57:18.548 --> 02:57:22.191]  And I look at them, I think, come on, Charlie, it's already here.
[02:57:22.191 --> 02:57:25.513]  It's just that every day they build the wall a little bit higher.
[02:57:25.513 --> 02:57:27.755]  And it's been here for quite a while.
[02:57:27.755 --> 02:57:37.562]  So it's not going to be a day when they ring the bell or you're going to read headlines in the newspapers that the New World Order arrived today at noon and the ceremony was, you know, so forth.
[02:57:37.870 --> 02:57:39.211]  Yeah, you're quite right, Alex.
[02:57:39.211 --> 02:57:49.940]  It's here, and it's creeping gradualism, and we get used to it, and they try to get everybody numb to it, so that they just don't know what to do, don't feel like doing anything.
[02:57:49.940 --> 02:57:53.903]  So, it's an obvious ploy, but what you do about it, I'm not quite sure.
[02:57:53.903 --> 02:57:57.566]  You just have to be aware, and be very, very cautious.
[02:57:57.566 --> 02:57:59.488]  I saw something last night.
[02:57:59.488 --> 02:58:03.131]  I was going over stuff to go into our Unfiltered News weekly service.
[02:58:03.621 --> 02:58:10.946]  And I saw something about, somebody had a photograph of a chemtrail plane, they said.
[02:58:10.946 --> 02:58:12.428]  It was on the ground.
[02:58:12.428 --> 02:58:13.949]  Boy, that looked convincing to me.
[02:58:13.949 --> 02:58:17.191]  And they had pictures of the pods there and everything.
[02:58:17.191 --> 02:58:18.332]  I looked at that.
[02:58:18.332 --> 02:58:20.173]  Wait a minute, where did this come from?
[02:58:20.173 --> 02:58:21.634]  Who is this guy?
[02:58:21.634 --> 02:58:22.555]  What do we know about that?
[02:58:22.555 --> 02:58:23.416]  What is this plane?
[02:58:23.416 --> 02:58:24.596]  Do I know anything about it?
[02:58:24.596 --> 02:58:25.017]  Stay there.
[02:58:25.017 --> 02:58:26.738]  Let's talk more about it on the other side.

[02:59:43.865 --> 02:59:46.648]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:59:56.056 --> 02:59:58.017]  We are now into the fourth hour.
[02:59:58.017 --> 02:59:59.738]  G. Edward Griffin is our guest.
[02:59:59.738 --> 03:00:05.400]  Coming up, we'll be taking your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[03:00:05.400 --> 03:00:09.422]  We'll even skip some of the breaks for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[03:00:09.422 --> 03:00:12.283]  We'll continue on with G. Edward Griffin during a few of the breaks.
[03:00:12.283 --> 03:00:19.326]  Or people listening on the InfoWars.com stream should go over there and be able to hear the behind-the-scenes stuff.
[03:00:19.326 --> 03:00:23.028]  G. Edward Griffin, we're going to give out his website, Freedom Force International, how to get involved.
[03:00:23.028 --> 03:00:24.108]  Great guy.
[03:00:24.108 --> 03:00:25.049]  Been around for
[03:00:25.822 --> 03:00:30.344]  Well, since 1959, fight in the new world order, best-selling author.
[03:00:30.344 --> 03:00:35.767]  I mean, without getting too sidetracked into this, but I think it's important to have discussions about this sometime.
[03:00:35.767 --> 03:00:39.069]  It'll be the same guy who comes out with fake Amaro coins.
[03:00:40.124 --> 03:00:44.008]  Uh, who later comes out as a known FBI operative, hooked in with Sean Hannity.
[03:00:44.008 --> 03:00:47.252]  And then he'll come out and say there was a secret session of Congress.
[03:00:47.252 --> 03:00:52.177]  Or other groups will put out, oh, Nassera, the government's secretly good and everything's fine.
[03:00:52.177 --> 03:00:58.083]  Or Leo Wanta got trillions of dollars and he's good, but only trust him, everyone else secretly works for the Pope.
[03:00:58.809 --> 03:01:08.137]  And you can always tell these government things, they're designed for the lowest common denominator and to get any, you know, idiot camp followers to kind of go along with it.
[03:01:08.137 --> 03:01:16.885]  Instead of saying, we can work together, we're positive, you know, the average person's good, it's evil at the top, we can affect change, we need to stop the collectivist.
[03:01:17.985 --> 03:01:22.067]  You notice that these groups that are government operatives, they never are issue-specific.
[03:01:22.067 --> 03:01:27.850]  They never get into how things work or about what the government's doing or what the corporations are doing.
[03:01:27.850 --> 03:01:36.013]  It's always about what other patriots are doing, and that's why I've been trying to wake up people to stop being part of this bellicose mental illness.
[03:01:36.013 --> 03:01:37.294]  Do you see what I'm saying, J. Eber-Griffin?
[03:01:37.839 --> 03:01:48.283]  Yeah, absolutely, and I'm very grateful that there is a voice such as yours, Alex, that is such a strong voice, heard by so many people, that's preaching common sense on this.
[03:01:48.283 --> 03:01:50.524]  Because, you know, this has been going on for a long time.
[03:01:50.524 --> 03:01:57.606]  You mentioned, I've been in this battle more or less since about 1959, and this was going on even then, believe it or not.
[03:01:57.606 --> 03:02:04.849]  But unfortunately, back in those days, there was no real strong voice against it that reached very many people.
[03:02:05.430 --> 03:02:07.331]  And people fell for it.
[03:02:07.331 --> 03:02:15.377]  All the patriots fell for it, which is, I think, one of the reasons that nothing really developed over the years in the way of a strong counterforce against this.
[03:02:15.377 --> 03:02:17.999]  So they were divided against each other.
[03:02:17.999 --> 03:02:19.540]  They fell for all of these ploys.
[03:02:19.540 --> 03:02:21.582]  And so we see the result of it today.
[03:02:21.582 --> 03:02:23.843]  But thank God you're out there telling the truth today.
[03:02:23.843 --> 03:02:27.025]  And we're trying to do the same thing with Freedom Force International.
[03:02:27.025 --> 03:02:32.329]  So maybe this time around we'll have a little better shot at it.
[03:02:32.329 --> 03:02:32.890]  This is really...
[03:02:33.897 --> 03:02:35.718]  A war for the brain, is it not?
[03:02:35.718 --> 03:02:36.098]  It is.
[03:02:36.098 --> 03:02:45.060]  Yeah, always behind that veiled fist, or that velvet fist, or the glove, I should say.
[03:02:45.060 --> 03:02:46.761]  Behind the glove is the fist.
[03:02:46.761 --> 03:02:48.501]  I'll try to get it out right here.
[03:02:48.501 --> 03:02:52.242]  But yeah, there's always the threat of physical force and coercion.
[03:02:52.242 --> 03:03:01.145]  But really, the greatest strides that our opponents have made in capturing the American people and in other countries, as well as by capturing their brain.
[03:03:01.874 --> 03:03:05.575]  They capture their minds, their information flow.
[03:03:05.575 --> 03:03:07.876]  They engineer their opinions.
[03:03:07.876 --> 03:03:10.797]  And this is how they control people today.
[03:03:10.797 --> 03:03:25.622]  And so we have to be alert to that and have strong leaders that can help us to, you know, weed through these rough paths and find out which are the stepping stones that are safe and which ones are dangerous.
[03:03:25.622 --> 03:03:27.883]  And that's the battle we have today.
[03:03:28.658 --> 03:03:38.261]  Now, the establishment is trying to focus, though, in on organized groups and websites and authors and attacking networks and things like that.
[03:03:38.261 --> 03:03:55.807]  But overall, the loss of confidence in the state and in the organized system, the top-down hierarchical structure, is so massive, and people are becoming more and more distrustful, that I'm intellectually pretty sure that the elite is in for some very rough times themselves.
[03:03:55.807 --> 03:03:58.048]  And, of course, they've foreseen that and tried to build up
[03:03:58.748 --> 03:04:02.090]  Yeah, I think they're quite right, but they're committed.
[03:04:02.090 --> 03:04:06.733]  I don't think the guys at the top are going to have any option of turning around.
[03:04:06.733 --> 03:04:07.173]  They're committed.
[03:04:07.173 --> 03:04:11.956]  So they're not going to back down, and I think the only hope we have is to beat them at their own game, to overpower them.
[03:04:27.253 --> 03:04:29.435]  And, uh, no, we do have numbers.
[03:04:29.435 --> 03:04:30.816]  We do have truth on our side.
[03:04:30.816 --> 03:04:33.159]  They're truly on the dark side.
[03:04:33.159 --> 03:04:35.180]  They are on the dark side.
[03:04:35.180 --> 03:04:37.863]  Like Chaney said in that interview, he says, we're working on the dark side.
[03:04:37.863 --> 03:04:38.463]  Stay there.
[03:04:38.463 --> 03:04:46.190]  I'm going to talk to you during the break for the InfoWars.com stream listeners, and then we'll come back for everybody else on the other side.
[03:04:46.190 --> 03:04:47.512]  It is a big idea.
[03:04:48.638 --> 03:04:50.400]  A New World Order.
[03:04:50.400 --> 03:04:54.924]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:04:54.924 --> 03:04:58.127]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:04:58.127 --> 03:05:00.929]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:05:00.929 --> 03:05:04.112]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:05:04.112 --> 03:05:11.438]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:05:14.454 --> 03:05:19.878]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:05:19.878 --> 03:05:23.760]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:05:23.760 --> 03:05:26.322]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:05:26.322 --> 03:05:27.483]  Most people have no idea.
[03:05:27.483 --> 03:05:28.283]  They're not after money.
[03:05:28.283 --> 03:05:29.564]  They have all the money they need.
[03:05:29.564 --> 03:05:30.545]  They're after power.
[03:05:30.545 --> 03:05:31.686]  That's what they're after these days.
[03:05:31.686 --> 03:05:36.449]  Order In Game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[03:05:43.213 --> 03:05:44.254]  You have been warned.
[03:05:45.314 --> 03:05:48.416]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[03:05:48.416 --> 03:05:53.938]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[03:05:53.938 --> 03:05:59.661]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[03:05:59.661 --> 03:06:01.141]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:06:01.141 --> 03:06:10.025]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[03:06:10.445 --> 03:06:12.286]  Now, compare a Calben Pure Soap.

[03:06:52.943 --> 03:06:54.563]  But the symptoms are there.
[03:06:54.563 --> 03:07:02.966]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[03:07:45.655 --> 03:07:51.036]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:07:51.036 --> 03:07:53.317]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:07:56.045 --> 03:07:57.326]  G. Edward Griffin is our guest.
[03:07:57.326 --> 03:07:59.888]  At the bottom of the hour, I promise, we're going directly to your calls.
[03:07:59.888 --> 03:08:02.390]  He'll be with us at least 20 minutes into overdrive today.
[03:08:02.390 --> 03:08:05.973]  We'll be going to 3.20 Central Standard Time today.
[03:08:05.973 --> 03:08:13.839]  G. Edward Griffin, we were talking about the ways the Globalists distract us, divert us.
[03:08:13.839 --> 03:08:15.400]  They try to destroy our unity.
[03:08:16.300 --> 03:08:18.801]  And I don't mean our unity as one organization.
[03:08:18.801 --> 03:08:20.881]  I don't want one group fighting the new world order.
[03:08:20.881 --> 03:08:24.303]  I want lots of attack frigates out there going after them.
[03:08:24.303 --> 03:08:31.565]  But I mean, unity of purpose, our manifesto, what we believe in, you know, the liberty, you know, ideas like that.
[03:08:31.565 --> 03:08:38.167]  But then shifting gears back into, for the mainline people that are still tuned into the false paradigm, they keep saying Barack Obama
[03:08:39.210 --> 03:08:43.492]  is about making us believe in each other again, bringing us back together.
[03:08:43.492 --> 03:08:58.760]  What they mean is not bringing us back together, but bringing us back into being conned by the state, conned by the left-right paradigm, conned by the two parties one more time, taking us for one more ride while they finish getting their police state control grid in.
[03:08:58.760 --> 03:09:01.341]  And let me be clear, I'm not even entertaining a debate here
[03:09:02.179 --> 03:09:04.560]  I'm not bashing Barack Obama here.
[03:09:04.560 --> 03:09:11.542]  The guy's a total puppet, runs nothing, you know, nice, handsome, friendly, smart guy, but he's a globalist.
[03:09:11.542 --> 03:09:20.244]  I dislike him less than Hillary because she's been around a while, you know, she's the devil I know, and I know she is a devil, but it doesn't matter.
[03:09:20.244 --> 03:09:23.065]  So me saying Barack Obama is a fake,
[03:09:24.165 --> 03:09:25.587]  I'm not saying Hillary's good.
[03:09:25.587 --> 03:09:26.968]  I'm not saying McCain's good.
[03:09:26.968 --> 03:09:29.151]  They're all bad.
[03:09:29.151 --> 03:09:35.197]  And so, occasionally, they give you a new puppet to make you think that things have changed.
[03:09:35.197 --> 03:09:36.899]  I'm not trying to take hope away here.
[03:09:36.899 --> 03:09:44.467]  I want you to know there's hope in real resistance, in a real awakening, in local government, in you taking action.
[03:09:44.867 --> 03:09:56.515]  In you running for office, in you educating others, instead of wasting all our energies like all these young people are doing, starry-eyed, just, I just love Hillary, I love McCain, I love Obama.
[03:09:56.515 --> 03:10:10.263]  You know, you know, you see all these, you know, intelligent, great-looking college girls just out there dedicating themselves to Hillary or Barack Obama, or all these well-meaning business people for McCain, when they're all America killers, they're all globalists.
[03:10:10.263 --> 03:10:10.984]  G. Edward Griffin.
[03:10:12.210 --> 03:10:14.052]  Well, what can you say?
[03:10:14.052 --> 03:10:14.752]  That's true.
[03:10:14.752 --> 03:10:25.341]  And the reason they're that way is because their opinions have been engineered by the media and to a large extent by the educational system that some of those younger people are still in.
[03:10:25.341 --> 03:10:29.445]  When you look at the campaign rhetoric of these major candidates,
[03:10:29.935 --> 03:10:35.896]  They can talk for hours and not really say anything, but they are masters at using words that sound good.
[03:10:35.896 --> 03:10:38.957]  Like, well, Obama's famous word, change.
[03:10:38.957 --> 03:10:42.738]  If we want change, or big chance, yes, change, change, change.
[03:10:42.738 --> 03:10:45.698]  But if you asked any of them, well, what would you change?
[03:10:45.698 --> 03:10:47.979]  They'd probably be dead silent because they don't know.
[03:10:47.979 --> 03:10:49.379]  They'd say, well, we'll change the name.
[03:10:49.379 --> 03:10:54.640]  We'll change the name from Bush to Obama or something.
[03:10:54.640 --> 03:10:57.181]  But they have no idea of political principles.
[03:10:58.508 --> 03:11:09.736]  They have never even thought about the proper role of government or what the Constitution says about what these candidates are allowed or specifically not allowed to do.
[03:11:09.736 --> 03:11:26.769]  They haven't a single thought in their entire brains about political concepts, but yet they're out there carrying these banners and chanting, as you said, and they're all starry-eyed over some kind of a word game, just change or compassion or
[03:11:28.118 --> 03:11:35.101]  Patriotism, or who knows what these words mean at the inner recesses of their minds.
[03:11:35.101 --> 03:11:39.003]  But they certainly don't mean anything in the realm of political principle.
[03:11:39.003 --> 03:11:44.626]  And until the American people start thinking about political principles once again, there is no hope.
[03:11:44.626 --> 03:11:53.130]  So, you're quite right when you say, why should we even entertain a debate or try to choose up sides between all three of these word masters?
[03:11:53.130 --> 03:11:56.231]  And it's not just them, it's the organizations that support them.
[03:11:56.724 --> 03:12:01.787]  When the real issues are never allowed to be even discussed in such a debate.
[03:12:01.787 --> 03:12:12.332]  And so, yes, our job has to be not to get entrapped by this so-called two-party system, when in reality it's not a two-party system.
[03:12:12.332 --> 03:12:14.053]  Well, it's a carnival distraction.
[03:12:14.053 --> 03:12:22.317]  It's like having a traveling carnival, a troupe of trained monkeys dance in front of you while somebody sneaks up on you to stab you in the back.
[03:12:23.835 --> 03:12:25.096]  It's distraction.
[03:12:25.096 --> 03:12:37.824]  It's the same thing that the magician does, where he has his beautiful assistant bend over in front of the crowd while he, you know, stages the hat trick.
[03:12:37.824 --> 03:12:39.605]  It works every time, doesn't it?
[03:12:39.605 --> 03:12:40.565]  Yeah.
[03:12:40.565 --> 03:12:46.609]  Yeah, well, that was the theme of my presentation when I was there in Austin a few weeks ago, as you remember.
[03:12:46.609 --> 03:12:48.190]  We called it the Quigley formula.
[03:12:48.780 --> 03:13:01.451]  And it was named after Professor Carol Quigley, who wrote the book, Tragedy and Hope, who was a sort of an unofficial or maybe an official historian for a secret society founded by Cecil Rhodes.
[03:13:01.451 --> 03:13:03.012]  And we got into all of that history.
[03:13:03.012 --> 03:13:13.942]  And the reason that history is interesting and the reason it's important is because without an understanding of how the two party systems came into being, if you don't know the history,
[03:13:14.306 --> 03:13:24.471]  If you don't know the fact that there is an organization that has a strategy for doing exactly what we're complaining about here, people would say, well, I guess it just happened.
[03:13:24.471 --> 03:13:26.192]  Well, no, it didn't just happen.
[03:13:26.192 --> 03:13:29.594]  This came about as a result of a very well thought out plan.
[03:13:29.594 --> 03:13:37.278]  It's being implemented today by people who have names, who belong to an organization that has a name, has a headquarters in New York and all of that.
[03:13:37.665 --> 03:13:47.312]  And so once you tell people about the facts behind what's happening and the names and the places and the dates, then all of a sudden it becomes real.
[03:13:47.312 --> 03:13:52.676]  Other than that, before they have all that information, they'll just look at you and say, what are you talking about?
[03:13:52.676 --> 03:13:54.478]  You know, I don't think that's true.
[03:13:54.478 --> 03:14:05.426]  And so what we're facing now is the fact that the people of America are starving for information and factual data.
[03:14:07.165 --> 03:14:07.585]  Oh, I agree with you.
[03:14:07.585 --> 03:14:09.907]  And I think that's our role.
[03:14:09.907 --> 03:14:10.387]  I agree with you.
[03:14:10.387 --> 03:14:23.558]  They are starving, and so they give them real simple pap, like change, change, knowing that stacked up against the two establishment candidates that another establishment candidate can be slipped in on them.
[03:14:23.558 --> 03:14:29.202]  Talk a little bit about the Quigley formula, because there are hundreds of published PhD-level
[03:14:30.319 --> 03:14:30.739]  I don't know.
[03:14:45.991 --> 03:15:03.855]  That some good old boy at the gym will waddle over and make fun of me saying I believe in imaginary groups when, you know, the heads of political science divisions of top universities, you know, write books about how they engineer the shadow government system and how we run nothing.
[03:15:03.855 --> 03:15:11.316]  I mean, it's very frustrating to know that we've spent the time to read all these books and watch these people on C-SPAN and then the public
[03:15:11.949 --> 03:15:20.531]  I mean, I hate the globalists, but at the same time, the public has been engineered to laugh at us for trying to save them.
[03:15:20.531 --> 03:15:22.671]  I mean, it's disgusting.
[03:15:22.671 --> 03:15:37.735]  Well, yeah, and you have to not blame the public to a certain extent, because they're just the products of programming, very effective programming, although I still think that if anybody had any kind of an instinct for truth,
[03:15:38.582 --> 03:15:40.183]  They would somehow break through that.
[03:15:40.183 --> 03:15:41.504]  I guess we did somehow.
[03:15:41.504 --> 03:15:47.027]  I don't know whether that was to our benefit or simply because of an accident that happened along the way.
[03:15:47.027 --> 03:15:49.388]  But in any event, yeah, it is frustrating.
[03:15:49.388 --> 03:15:52.870]  But the bottom line is that this is not imaginary.
[03:15:52.870 --> 03:16:00.335]  And anybody who has any intellectual curiosity or honesty about them would say, OK, where are your facts?
[03:16:00.335 --> 03:16:01.896]  And then that's where we come in.
[03:16:01.896 --> 03:16:02.656]  Here are the facts.
[03:16:03.038 --> 03:16:18.089]  And I found that generally, if you have the ability to present the facts without being interrupted, you know, give me 20 or 30 minutes, and if people are interested enough to sit and listen to a presentation for 20 or 30 minutes, I'll convince them.
[03:16:18.089 --> 03:16:22.632]  Not that I'll convince them, but the facts will convince them, because they're irrefutable.
[03:16:22.632 --> 03:16:32.499]  So that's our job, is to find those people, and there won't be many, probably 3% or less, who have the intellectual curiosity and the intellectual honesty.
[03:16:32.935 --> 03:16:35.376]  To ask the question, where are your facts?
[03:16:35.376 --> 03:16:37.817]  And that's all we need, Alex, and you know that.
[03:16:37.817 --> 03:16:42.159]  We don't need that 51, that magic 51% of the population.
[03:16:42.159 --> 03:16:44.000]  The majority never determined anything.
[03:16:44.000 --> 03:16:52.324]  They're always led by the few, 3% or less, who can generate a majority by the strength of their leadership.
[03:16:52.324 --> 03:16:53.704]  And that's what we must do.
[03:16:53.704 --> 03:16:54.985]  That's what our enemies have done.
[03:16:55.427 --> 03:17:03.432]  And as you know, that's what Freedom Force is all about, is to move into the power centers of society, those groups and organizations.
[03:17:03.993 --> 03:17:08.937]  Well, now again, I'm trying to be subtle here, not that I'm delicate, or not that I'm even well-spoken.
[03:17:08.937 --> 03:17:10.778]  Maybe I haven't explained it right to some people.
[03:17:10.778 --> 03:17:11.839]  I'm not against the militia.
[03:17:11.839 --> 03:17:13.540]  I believe in the militia.
[03:17:13.540 --> 03:17:14.541]  I'm a member of the militia.
[03:17:14.541 --> 03:17:15.501]  18 to 44 are all part of it.
[03:17:27.971 --> 03:17:32.216]  Uh, and it's in our Constitution and the Feds say we have no right to own guns.
[03:17:32.216 --> 03:17:36.602]  It's only an organized militia, but that didn't exist until 1907.
[03:17:36.602 --> 03:17:39.786]  Uh, so, so we know it's our right to keep and bear arms.
[03:17:39.786 --> 03:17:42.029]  It's to defend against criminals and the government.
[03:17:42.029 --> 03:17:44.092]  And I've read the Federalist Papers and others on air.
[03:17:45.054 --> 03:18:12.714]  But then you've got what the modern militia movement is, and that's feds setting up innocent good people, and usually the militia leaders are feds, and it's a thing of paranoia, don't trust your neighbors, meet us behind the barn, and then the feds says let's build a bomb so they can send a bunch of innocent farmers to jail, and then asset forfeiture their farms, and then I get on air and I say watch out, we're up front, we're in suits and ties, we're well-spoken, we're the good guys,
[03:18:13.394 --> 03:18:23.644]  But the Feds, when they run these operations, they've tried to always steer our movement into hiding, and like it's secret agent stuff, and it's all, oh my God, everyone's watching you and wanting to get you.
[03:18:23.644 --> 03:18:26.407]  And I'm saying, no, no, no, no, this isn't a thing of paranoia.
[03:18:26.407 --> 03:18:27.708]  We are the good guys.
[03:18:27.708 --> 03:18:32.993]  We're out in the town square with the white hat at high noon saying, bring it on.
[03:18:32.993 --> 03:18:34.314]  Do you see the point I'm making?
[03:18:34.314 --> 03:18:35.075]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:18:35.075 --> 03:18:36.116]  I couldn't agree with you more.
[03:18:36.756 --> 03:18:45.683]  And, yeah, it has always worried me deeply as to the character that the militia movements have taken.
[03:18:45.683 --> 03:18:59.013]  They're going in the wrong direction, and I think the reason, as you've just stated, is because they are under the influence of Asia provocateurs who are sent in there to do that, just to mess it up so it won't possibly work.
[03:18:59.013 --> 03:19:03.016]  Oh, we've caught them hundreds of times in every case.
[03:19:03.016 --> 03:19:04.237]  It turns out that's what they do.
[03:19:05.709 --> 03:19:07.470]  So, they're smart.
[03:19:07.470 --> 03:19:08.710]  So, okay, they're smart.
[03:19:08.710 --> 03:19:09.871]  Now, what are we going to do about it?
[03:19:09.871 --> 03:19:11.031]  Let's be just as smart.
[03:19:11.031 --> 03:19:14.092]  Let's not let them win that game.
[03:19:14.092 --> 03:19:17.493]  Let's be aware of it and move around.
[03:19:17.493 --> 03:19:27.057]  Well, I mean, I remembered when I was just a mainline conservative, but fighting for property rights locally, I'd have a guy show up at an event and say, I want to work with you, let's kill cops.
[03:19:27.057 --> 03:19:30.078]  And I'd follow him outside and the guy would get in an unmarked cop car.
[03:19:31.125 --> 03:19:34.287]  And, you know, I mean, it's just, these people are criminals.
[03:19:34.287 --> 03:19:36.488]  Dirtbag slime.
[03:19:36.488 --> 03:19:41.890]  And, uh, well, Texas Monthly caught the FBI creating a Klan group trying to get them to blow up a chemical plant.
[03:19:41.890 --> 03:19:46.352]  They were so dumb, the FBI couldn't get them to do it.
[03:19:46.352 --> 03:19:48.853]  It is a big idea.
[03:19:48.853 --> 03:19:50.614]  A new world order.
[03:19:50.614 --> 03:19:55.076]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:19:55.498 --> 03:19:58.302]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:19:58.302 --> 03:20:01.106]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:20:01.106 --> 03:20:04.291]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:20:04.291 --> 03:20:11.621]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:20:14.645 --> 03:20:20.089]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:20:20.089 --> 03:20:23.951]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:20:23.951 --> 03:20:26.513]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:20:26.513 --> 03:20:27.674]  Most people have no idea.
[03:20:27.674 --> 03:20:28.474]  They're not after money.
[03:20:28.474 --> 03:20:29.735]  They have all the money they need.
[03:20:29.735 --> 03:20:30.716]  They're after power.
[03:20:30.716 --> 03:20:31.877]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[03:24:18.724 --> 03:24:30.791]  It's because the globalists claim that their breeding makes them god men when they're really a bunch of inbred, mentally retarded individuals at the top.
[03:24:45.706 --> 03:24:51.029]  Well, these criminal bureaucracies that serve them, that's where their genius still lies.
[03:24:51.029 --> 03:24:55.531]  The truth is, from the common people also comes intelligence, and we don't want to be your slaves.
[03:24:56.570 --> 03:24:59.151]  We're not lesser men, and we're not going to go along with you.
[03:24:59.151 --> 03:25:05.054]  Gee, Edward Griffin, we'll talk through the next segment in the next break for Infowars.com, internet stream listeners.
[03:25:05.054 --> 03:25:18.360]  But right now, you want to get into Carol Quigley and the Quigley Method, because I didn't want to kind of give away your thunder when you were on before you gave your UT speech, but maybe now you should spend some time on that, and then we'll start taking phone calls in about 10 minutes.
[03:25:18.977 --> 03:25:24.620]  Yeah, I'd like to do that, Alex, but may I finish where my brain was going with our last segment?
[03:25:24.620 --> 03:25:26.020]  Certainly.
[03:25:26.020 --> 03:25:37.386]  We were talking about false leadership and how effective that can be, especially if the victim is not even aware of the possibility that this tactic is being used.
[03:25:37.386 --> 03:25:47.010]  Every once in a while, after I've written something or said something about this, I'll get an email from some person that'll say, how do we know that you are not a false leader?
[03:25:47.928 --> 03:25:49.429]  And of course that's a darn good question.
[03:25:49.429 --> 03:25:55.011]  I'm very happy to hear that because now I know that people are beginning to look around and question.
[03:25:55.011 --> 03:25:57.292]  And that the answer to that is very simple.
[03:25:57.292 --> 03:26:02.694]  You can tell whether a person is a false leader or not simply by looking at their record.
[03:26:02.694 --> 03:26:05.595]  Where they've been, how long they've been doing it, what they've actually done.
[03:26:05.595 --> 03:26:06.715]  Their fruits!
[03:26:06.715 --> 03:26:08.716]  Their fruits shall reveal them, yeah.
[03:26:09.406 --> 03:26:22.999]  So you see, if they have a record of dividing people, whether they have a record of diverting attention away from the real culprit, which is the government, not government, but people in government, I always want to emphasize that.
[03:26:22.999 --> 03:26:24.741]  We're not opposed to government.
[03:26:24.741 --> 03:26:26.663]  We're opposed to corruption in government.
[03:26:27.464 --> 03:26:36.530]  And if you can see that leaders have been focused on the corruption in government and consistently have tried to unite people, they're probably on the right track.
[03:26:36.530 --> 03:26:48.057]  But if they've always left behind them a debris of broken organizations and anger and division, you've got a pretty good idea that you're dealing with a false leader.
[03:26:49.116 --> 03:26:58.459]  And so what we're trying to do is build a dependable leadership core that people can rely on, especially people coming into the movement early.
[03:26:58.459 --> 03:27:01.060]  I mean, just recently, I should say.
[03:27:01.060 --> 03:27:04.441]  People who haven't had a chance to spend years and years studying this thing.
[03:27:04.441 --> 03:27:07.122]  They need someone they can rely on.
[03:27:07.122 --> 03:27:08.122]  Someone with that record.
[03:27:08.122 --> 03:27:12.664]  And we're hoping that people will consider Freedom Force International to be that.
[03:27:13.164 --> 03:27:19.528]  So, if you're trying to figure out who you can rely on, come to Freedom Force International.
[03:27:19.528 --> 03:27:22.129]  Check us out and ask the question.
[03:27:22.129 --> 03:27:27.472]  Well, I'll say, G. Edward Griffin, the enemy doesn't operate for 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, 40 plus years since 1959.
[03:27:31.294 --> 03:27:32.695]  We're good to go.
[03:27:55.322 --> 03:27:58.544]  Most of the groups and organizations out there are actually good.
[03:27:58.544 --> 03:28:03.869]  The folks out on the ground are good.
[03:28:03.869 --> 03:28:09.514]  But you can really tell the organizations of people that are bad.
[03:28:09.514 --> 03:28:13.217]  And, I mean, Jim Griffin, we know you're good.
[03:28:13.217 --> 03:28:16.560]  We know so many others are good as well.
[03:28:16.560 --> 03:28:18.862]  And a lot of it's also discernment.
[03:28:18.862 --> 03:28:21.084]  You know, having your head in the game a long time.
[03:28:21.084 --> 03:28:21.585]  But also,
[03:28:22.145 --> 03:28:33.052]  You know, not just being aware of disinfo, being aware of also the fact that we can also get too into this where we're too focused and paranoid and then never just move forward.
[03:28:33.052 --> 03:28:45.901]  I think really having a good attitude, viewers out there, listeners out there, you know that you're good people, you know you're leaders, you know that you've done nothing wrong, you know that you're doing this for the right reasons, so you be leaders.
[03:28:45.901 --> 03:28:47.662]  You go out and start organizations.
[03:28:47.662 --> 03:28:50.063]  I mean, I think, you know, there's no excuse there.
[03:28:50.063 --> 03:28:50.884]  Is there, G. Edward Griffin?
[03:28:51.404 --> 03:28:53.846]  No, no, no excuse at all, whatsoever.
[03:28:53.846 --> 03:28:57.929]  And you know, in a way that takes us back finally to the Quigley formula.
[03:28:57.929 --> 03:29:05.595]  Because Quigley was talking to some extent, to a very important extent, about how to provide false leadership.
[03:29:05.595 --> 03:29:08.477]  And so, are we ready for that topic?
[03:29:08.477 --> 03:29:10.579]  Yes, let's continue discussing that.
[03:29:11.357 --> 03:29:18.060]  During this segment, if you're listening to the InfoWars.com audio streams, this discussion will continue in 10 seconds at InfoWars.com.
[03:29:18.060 --> 03:29:22.402]  If not, we'll be back in three minutes to continue fleshing out the Quigley formula.
[03:29:22.402 --> 03:29:24.903]  And then your phone calls with G. Edward Griffin.
[03:29:24.903 --> 03:29:31.126]  We got him on a bit late today, so we'll be going into overdrive today, 20 minutes after the main transmission ends with G. Edward Griffin.
[03:29:31.126 --> 03:29:34.628]  So we have an hour left, or about 50 minutes, before us.
[03:29:34.628 --> 03:29:36.028]  Stay with us.
[03:29:36.028 --> 03:29:37.429]  We're on the march.
[03:29:37.429 --> 03:29:38.930]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:39.945 --> 03:29:42.636]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:46.414 --> 03:29:50.176]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[03:29:50.176 --> 03:29:54.879]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[03:29:54.879 --> 03:30:00.182]  I have run across a company called SFR, who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[03:30:00.182 --> 03:30:11.408]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, Protecta Complete Fuel System Treatment cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage in only one tank full.
[03:30:11.408 --> 03:30:13.770]  Protecta Engine Treatment not only reduces friction,
[03:30:14.170 --> 03:30:16.211]  But it extends the life of your engine.
[03:30:16.211 --> 03:30:17.132]  Let's face it.
[03:30:17.132 --> 03:30:19.973]  With the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[03:30:19.973 --> 03:30:27.978]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment which is a $12.95 value free.
[03:30:27.978 --> 03:30:30.279]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[03:30:30.279 --> 03:30:33.401]  That number again is 888-USE-SFR1.
[03:30:33.401 --> 03:30:37.463]  Or check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com.
[03:30:37.463 --> 03:30:39.644]  That's oilcompanysecret.com.
[03:30:39.644 --> 03:30:42.006]  Satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[03:30:42.467 --> 03:30:44.124]  And it's safe for all cars.
[03:30:44.124 --> 03:30:44.447]  Act now.
[03:30:46.141 --> 03:30:48.662]  Hi, this is Dave from Ready Reserve Foods.
[03:30:48.662 --> 03:30:56.024]  I have been waiting patiently for the government and mainstream media to inform you of what is turning out to be the biggest problem facing the world in the last 50 years.
[03:30:56.024 --> 03:31:01.606]  For the last three years, the earth has consumed more food than it has been able to produce, and it has now finally caught up with this.
[03:31:01.606 --> 03:31:08.549]  In the U.S., commodities such as flour and rice are already being rationed, and the next rice crop won't be available for another four to five months.
[03:31:08.549 --> 03:31:15.171]  It's fall in the southern hemisphere, and many countries are short the food necessary to make it through the winter and have stopped exporting certain commodities altogether.
[03:31:15.956 --> 03:31:17.537]  Remember our trade deficit?
[03:31:17.537 --> 03:31:23.401]  Trillions of dollars have stacked up outside the country and are now rushing in to buy our food production at any price.
[03:31:23.401 --> 03:31:29.785]  By late summer, if not early fall, it is likely our government will step in and control food and food exports under martial law.
[03:31:29.785 --> 03:31:31.266]  Call Ready Reserve Foods at 1-800-453-2202.
[03:31:31.266 --> 03:31:31.346]  1-800-453-2202.

[03:31:48.076 --> 03:31:48.436]  Police!
[03:31:48.436 --> 03:31:49.357]  Fire it!
[03:31:49.357 --> 03:31:51.737]  We're already under a scientific dictatorship.
[03:31:51.737 --> 03:31:55.238]  Martial Law is coming, but it's not going to arrive overnight.
[03:31:55.238 --> 03:31:57.198]  It's going to be incremental.
[03:31:57.198 --> 03:31:59.198]  This country is already teetering on the edge.
[03:31:59.198 --> 03:32:02.279]  Any incident, small or large, could trigger a total takeover.
[03:32:02.279 --> 03:32:03.739]  Anything could be the final push.
[03:32:03.739 --> 03:32:09.620]  Visit survivemartiallaw.com and download the e-book full of information that will prepare you for life under total military control.
[03:32:09.620 --> 03:32:12.561]  Know how to survive in the conditions that may soon be here on American soil.
[03:32:12.941 --> 03:32:17.825]  Learn how to act around controlling troops, and how to use their own psychology against them through social engineering.
[03:32:17.825 --> 03:32:24.450]  When martial law is officially announced, checkpoints will be enforced, gun confiscations will occur for registered gun owners, and cities will be on lockdown.
[03:32:24.450 --> 03:32:28.313]  You will be dealing with a force that has been in training for years, preparing for this takeover.
[03:32:28.313 --> 03:32:30.274]  Visit survivemartiallaw.com.
[03:32:30.274 --> 03:32:32.996]  When ordering this e-book, you also receive weekly updates.
[03:32:32.996 --> 03:32:35.358]  Visit survivemartiallaw.com, or call 866-644-1933.
[03:32:35.358 --> 03:32:35.698]  That's 866-644-1933.
[03:32:52.358 --> 03:32:53.860]  We'll be going into overtime.
[03:32:53.860 --> 03:32:57.563]  That is, the main radio show is four hours, Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[03:32:57.563 --> 03:33:00.746]  to 3 p.m., and I come back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:33:00.746 --> 03:33:04.449]  This New World Order takeover is very serious, and I take it very serious.
[03:33:04.449 --> 03:33:07.432]  That's why I work normally about 14 hours a day.
[03:33:07.432 --> 03:33:09.074]  I've cut back from 18 hours a day.
[03:33:10.404 --> 03:33:18.468]  That's why I've made a new film that I'll be showing at the Alamo Draft House this Saturday at 3.30 at downtown Alamo at their new, quote, Ritz location.
[03:33:18.468 --> 03:33:20.970]  Details at InfoWars.com.
[03:33:20.970 --> 03:33:31.315]  For InfoWars.com listeners on our internet streams, and for those watching PrisonPlanet.tv, we continue during the break talking about Carroll Quigley, who set up the Rhodes Scholarship Program.
[03:33:31.315 --> 03:33:36.398]  He owned the major diamond mines and gold mines in Rhodesia in South Africa, north of there.
[03:33:37.519 --> 03:33:41.082]  And of course, it turned out he was just an agent of the Queen the entire time.
[03:33:41.082 --> 03:33:46.767]  And of course, one of his people that worked for him wrote a book about it after he died.
[03:33:46.767 --> 03:33:50.531]  Do you think everybody that is a Rhodes Scholar ends up staying on their payroll?
[03:33:50.531 --> 03:33:54.414]  Because we see a Kris Kristofferson who speaks out against him.
[03:33:54.414 --> 03:33:57.157]  We see a Naomi Wolf who comes out and
[03:33:58.050 --> 03:33:58.851]  Speaks out against it.
[03:33:58.851 --> 03:34:00.872]  You know, the Marshall Law setup.
[03:34:00.872 --> 03:34:04.135]  But I had her on the show a few months ago and I said, but you're a Rhodes Scholar.
[03:34:04.135 --> 03:34:06.737]  I said, people ask how we get these guests.
[03:34:06.737 --> 03:34:07.977]  We call their publicist.
[03:34:07.977 --> 03:34:08.538]  We get them on.
[03:34:08.538 --> 03:34:10.059]  You could try it too if you'd like.
[03:34:10.059 --> 03:34:11.920]  I think it's a conspiracy that we're able to get them on.
[03:34:11.920 --> 03:34:13.301]  It's a big radio show, folks.
[03:34:13.301 --> 03:34:15.223]  They want to come on and pitch their book.
[03:34:15.223 --> 03:34:18.205]  And you can call them too and get them on your show, probably.
[03:34:18.205 --> 03:34:20.227]  If you know how to talk to somebody on the telephone, that is.
[03:34:20.227 --> 03:34:22.048]  That's the big conspiracy is just to act friendly.
[03:34:22.648 --> 03:34:24.330]  I'm just being sarcastic to some people out there.
[03:34:24.330 --> 03:34:26.132]  But the point is, I had her on and asked the hard question.
[03:34:26.132 --> 03:34:27.774]  I said, are you for a world government?
[03:34:27.774 --> 03:34:28.875]  She said, no.
[03:34:28.875 --> 03:34:30.998]  They didn't teach me that in a Rhodes Scholarship.
[03:34:30.998 --> 03:34:39.267]  But I know that Cecil Rhodes called for world government, called for a British Anglophile-dominated system, merged with the Rothschilds.
[03:34:39.267 --> 03:34:41.009]  So do you think Naomi Wolf is fibbing there?
[03:34:41.977 --> 03:34:46.901]  No, that's a really good question, and you're not the first person that asked that question of me.
[03:34:46.901 --> 03:35:01.433]  I find it hard to believe that a person can be selected as a Rhodes Scholarship and actually go through the whole process and be educated there in London and be part of that group without being a devotee of world government.
[03:35:01.433 --> 03:35:04.195]  I just find that very, very difficult to believe.
[03:35:04.195 --> 03:35:08.819]  You know, Kris Kristofferson's people said they knew who we were, but that he wasn't going to come on the show.
[03:35:09.680 --> 03:35:16.264]  But then we get Willie Nelson and Jesse Ventura and Tommy Chong and Charlie Sheen and German Defense Ministers.
[03:35:16.264 --> 03:35:23.869]  The incredible thing is I had the head of the Kissinger Group on last week, and when I got him on during the break, I said, hello sir, and he started laughing at me.
[03:35:23.869 --> 03:35:24.570]  And I said, what's funny?
[03:35:24.570 --> 03:35:26.251]  He goes, oh, Alex Jones.
[03:35:26.251 --> 03:35:27.432]  And I said, oh, you know who I am?
[03:35:27.432 --> 03:35:27.892]  You're coming on.
[03:35:27.892 --> 03:35:29.433]  He goes, of course we all know who you are.
[03:35:29.433 --> 03:35:32.395]  In fact, John Harmon, running the show, heard it.
[03:35:32.395 --> 03:35:38.259]  Hey, John, were you listening in on that conversation I had with the head of the Kissinger Group?
[03:35:39.855 --> 03:35:41.316]  Are you on air right now?
[03:35:41.316 --> 03:35:42.496]  No, I am.
[03:35:42.496 --> 03:35:43.397]  Bring yourself on air.
[03:35:43.397 --> 03:35:51.380]  Did you hear how he admitted, I mean, I didn't want to toot my horn on air, would have sounded obnoxious, but after the fact, it isn't that he knew who I was, that's actually scary.
[03:35:51.380 --> 03:35:56.923]  This is the head of the Kissinger Group, one of the heads of the Carnegie Endowment, and he's saying, yeah, we know, we all know who you are.
[03:35:56.923 --> 03:35:57.803]  Well, John, you heard it.
[03:35:57.803 --> 03:36:00.324]  Tell, uh, tell Jebber Griffin what he was saying.
[03:36:00.324 --> 03:36:06.367]  Oh, yeah, he was very arrogant, and, uh, you know, Jones was joking with him, calling him master, and he seemed to like that, actually.
[03:36:08.907 --> 03:36:11.091]  Yeah, I'm sure he does like that.
[03:36:11.091 --> 03:36:16.319]  These guys are very arrogant and they want people to just do what they say.
[03:36:17.193 --> 03:36:31.259]  You see, what happened is we got him queued up, and I, you know, John called him at like 29 after, and then he was going to be on at 33 after, so I come on and say, thank you for coming on, we're not live yet, but I'm going to have you on in just a moment, sir.
[03:36:31.259 --> 03:36:33.940]  He started laughing at me, and I said, was something wrong?
[03:36:33.940 --> 03:36:36.821]  And he said, no, Alex Jones.
[03:36:36.821 --> 03:36:38.081]  And I went, what, do you know who I am?
[03:36:38.081 --> 03:36:40.042]  And he goes, of course we know who you are.
[03:36:40.482 --> 03:36:42.744]  I mean, folks, do you realize they know who I am?
[03:36:42.744 --> 03:36:49.488]  G. Edward Griffin, that means we must be hurting him if he was... if he wanted to arrogantly laugh at me before we went on air.
[03:36:49.488 --> 03:36:52.850]  I mean, I remember six years ago in L.A.
[03:36:52.850 --> 03:37:03.377]  having Lionel Chetwin, who made the film about Bush being a hero in 9-11, the head of his film commission, came up in the bathroom while I was at the urinal and threatened me and said, we're gonna get you.
[03:37:03.377 --> 03:37:06.700]  And then I went out on TV and debated him, but I mean, I'm not tooting my horn.
[03:37:06.700 --> 03:37:10.282]  That's actually scary, but that shows how real this is, doesn't it, G. Edward?
[03:37:10.682 --> 03:37:16.448]  Oh yeah, this is real stuff, and usually it doesn't happen in the bathroom.
[03:37:16.448 --> 03:37:23.095]  It usually happens in the boardroom, but it's very real stuff, Alex, and yeah, you bet they know who you are.
[03:37:23.095 --> 03:37:25.818]  You're a thorn in their side.
[03:37:25.818 --> 03:37:27.139]  People ask why they haven't killed me.
[03:37:27.139 --> 03:37:28.240]  Why they haven't killed G.E.B.
[03:37:28.240 --> 03:37:29.582]  or Griffin, haven't killed Alex Jones.
[03:37:29.582 --> 03:37:33.606]  I know you're sick of being asked that, but people are obsessed with it, so please humor them.
[03:37:34.485 --> 03:37:36.366]  Well, I know how they work.
[03:37:36.366 --> 03:37:45.151]  They want us both eliminated, and they have a definite hierarchy of strategies for that.
[03:37:45.151 --> 03:37:46.632]  I've observed it over the years.
[03:37:46.632 --> 03:37:50.834]  The first thing they do if they want to eliminate their opposition is to ignore it.
[03:37:50.834 --> 03:37:54.816]  And you know, in 99% of the cases, that works just fine.
[03:37:54.816 --> 03:37:56.237]  You don't have to do anything.
[03:37:56.741 --> 03:38:05.244]  Because their opponents have no funding, they have no voice, they have no following, they have no way to survive, really.
[03:38:05.244 --> 03:38:10.646]  And so usually they're just a little splash in the pan and then they go away entirely on their own.
[03:38:10.646 --> 03:38:12.687]  So the first step is to ignore it.
[03:38:12.687 --> 03:38:18.589]  If that doesn't work, well, the next step is to discredit it, to destroy it in the eyes of the American public.
[03:38:19.153 --> 03:38:22.935]  This is where they bring their big media guns into play.
[03:38:22.935 --> 03:38:40.106]  They try and paint that big brush around the face of their target that makes them look like some kind of a real nut, a child molester, a tax evader, a terrorist, or God only knows what they can throw at the American public.
[03:38:40.106 --> 03:38:40.606]  A hater!
[03:38:40.606 --> 03:38:42.067]  Some people believe it.
[03:38:42.067 --> 03:38:44.969]  A hater or something like that, a fascist, a Nazi.
[03:38:45.931 --> 03:38:48.172]  Communists, they've got all kinds of words.
[03:38:48.172 --> 03:38:53.013]  Racists, they've got a bushel basket full of words they can throw out.
[03:38:53.013 --> 03:38:56.575]  And unfortunately, most of the American people will believe it.
[03:38:56.575 --> 03:38:58.135]  So, that usually works.
[03:38:58.135 --> 03:39:03.317]  I mean, the few that survive step number one get eliminated at step number two.
[03:39:03.317 --> 03:39:13.000]  If they survive step number two, then the next level of opposition is to try and buy them off, either directly or indirectly.
[03:39:13.430 --> 03:39:25.216]  They provide funding, or they provide investments in their corporations, and they load their board of directors, and over a period of time, all of a sudden, their organizations are bought off.
[03:39:25.216 --> 03:39:26.997]  And sometimes they're even offered money.
[03:39:26.997 --> 03:39:28.438]  Why don't you just go retire?
[03:39:28.438 --> 03:39:29.458]  You're old enough now.
[03:39:29.458 --> 03:39:31.659]  You've done your share.
[03:39:31.659 --> 03:39:37.762]  You can go live in the Bahamas, and we have this estate for you, and a chauffeur, and a limousine, and so forth.
[03:39:37.762 --> 03:39:39.203]  And why don't you just go away?
[03:39:40.154 --> 03:39:49.159]  And if that doesn't work, then finally they turn to more physical things where sometimes people are suicided or that kind of thing.
[03:39:49.159 --> 03:39:52.341]  But I know what they do, it's pretty predictable.
[03:39:52.341 --> 03:40:00.145]  So the fact that you and I are still surviving means that I guess we haven't been discredited yet.
[03:40:00.723 --> 03:40:02.503]  Well, here's what's happening.
[03:40:02.503 --> 03:40:07.005]  I had Nightline call me, and I know that's an operation.
[03:40:07.005 --> 03:40:12.006]  That show's come out, is CIA Pentagon run, and I'm just basically told them no.
[03:40:12.006 --> 03:40:15.207]  I said, I have no... I mean, first they wanted to talk to WeAreChange.
[03:40:15.207 --> 03:40:18.547]  They wanted to talk to me at first, and I said to WeAreChange, do you want to talk to them?
[03:40:18.547 --> 03:40:20.228]  And most people would kill to be on Nightline.
[03:40:20.228 --> 03:40:21.728]  Not me, folks.
[03:40:21.728 --> 03:40:24.629]  The old adage, any publicity is good publicity, is actually not true.
[03:40:25.189 --> 03:40:35.034]  And I just said, you know what, because Discovery Channel comes in, History Channel comes in, BBC comes in, and they'll tell you, oh, I'm a fan.
[03:40:35.034 --> 03:40:36.935]  And I go, come on, I know you're lying.
[03:40:36.935 --> 03:40:38.056]  I see the predatory look.
[03:40:38.056 --> 03:40:39.396]  I know it's a hit piece.
[03:40:39.396 --> 03:40:42.718]  And then it's a total dishonest hit piece.
[03:40:42.718 --> 03:40:48.581]  And now at this point, they are so discredited.
[03:40:48.581 --> 03:40:49.922]  Now, if it's live, I'll do it.
[03:40:49.922 --> 03:40:52.063]  I've always said I won't turn down anything that's live.
[03:40:53.039 --> 03:41:20.515]  uh... but and and and so that you know i do get those opportunities few and far between and i don't turn them down because there i can actually you know try to get something out right but you know to have the head of the kissinger group which as you know is one of the most powerful groups out there very that's a rothschild slash rockefeller management group uh... you know uh... saying i'm coming on i'm coming on the counter you guys and i said on air i said you guys must really be in trouble if you're having to go ahead and come on shows now and he basically was
[03:41:21.235 --> 03:41:30.660]  You know, just said, yeah, and other people have gone out and confronted globalist at events and said, you know, the New World Order is falling apart and they say, well, it's in trouble, but we're going to keep it going.
[03:41:30.660 --> 03:41:31.861]  I mean, this is their life.
[03:41:31.861 --> 03:41:33.582]  Do you want to comment on that?
[03:41:33.582 --> 03:41:40.265]  Well, yeah, I think it is their life and that they know how to manipulate opinion and public opinion.
[03:41:40.265 --> 03:41:45.988]  So these guys must have thought that by coming on to your show that they were clever enough and skilled enough to
[03:41:48.138 --> 03:41:57.626]  To create, to move public opinion against you, I guess, or to capture your audience in some way, or at least to paint the picture that they were really nice guys after all.
[03:41:57.626 --> 03:42:01.249]  They must have had some vision of how... Well, no, they were trying to humanize themselves.
[03:42:01.249 --> 03:42:07.834]  He made... We counted it ten times in a 30-minute interview, which is, I guess, about 25 minutes of airtime.
[03:42:09.207 --> 03:42:17.613]  He said 10 times, well, we've got evil robber barons and we've got to have a world government to contain and control them.
[03:42:17.613 --> 03:42:19.274]  Well, that we've already got a world government.
[03:42:19.274 --> 03:42:21.075]  These guys already do what they want.
[03:42:21.075 --> 03:42:23.336]  We've got to have this global government to control them.
[03:42:23.336 --> 03:42:26.238]  And I said on air, I said, I said, you've said that a bunch of times.
[03:42:26.238 --> 03:42:27.559]  And he got mad at that.
[03:42:27.559 --> 03:42:29.240]  I said, you're just putting a talking point out.
[03:42:29.240 --> 03:42:30.962]  And he said, well, I'm allowed to have my view.
[03:42:30.962 --> 03:42:33.623]  And I said, you are the guys that want the world government.
[03:42:33.623 --> 03:42:35.545]  It's like, please don't throw me in the briar patch.
[03:42:35.545 --> 03:42:38.887]  So I talked to him at the end of the interview and he was, he was upset.
[03:42:40.068 --> 03:42:42.709]  And I didn't taunt him, because I know they're very dangerous.
[03:42:42.709 --> 03:42:44.050]  I just said, look, thank you for coming on.
[03:42:44.050 --> 03:42:47.072]  I really hope you'll change your mind about trying to enslave us.
[03:42:47.072 --> 03:42:49.013]  And he just said goodbye.
[03:42:49.013 --> 03:42:49.954]  But he was not friendly.
[03:42:49.954 --> 03:42:51.395]  In fact, John, did you hear that?
[03:42:51.395 --> 03:42:55.557]  How he was not happy at the end?
[03:42:55.557 --> 03:42:58.879]  Well, I guess he just didn't achieve his goal, that's all.
[03:42:58.879 --> 03:43:05.984]  But you know, thinking back to Naomi, and you asked whether or not she really might be sincere or not.
[03:43:06.531 --> 03:43:18.338]  I have no doubt that she is totally sincere in her opposition to martial law and in her opposition to the neocon agenda, but my question is why does she not mention anything
[03:43:19.351 --> 03:43:24.434]  About the left-wing agenda that is advocated by... It's identical!
[03:43:24.434 --> 03:43:31.477]  It's just got a different... It's like a velvet iron fist, you know, a red glove or a black glove over it.
[03:43:31.477 --> 03:43:39.021]  It's identical, and she plays the game of trying to make it seem like it's all a right-wing conspiracy.
[03:43:39.742 --> 03:43:41.904]  And totally ignores the left wing.
[03:43:41.904 --> 03:43:48.909]  And you and I both know the left wing and the right wing are just two different wings of the same ugly bird called collectivism.
[03:43:48.909 --> 03:43:58.956]  So when I see a Rhodes Scholar that's playing the game of focusing totally on one side of this little scam and not the other, I know what she's doing.
[03:43:58.956 --> 03:44:02.038]  She's trying to generate support for the Democrats.
[03:44:02.853 --> 03:44:04.694]  That's what her mission is, as far as I know.
[03:44:04.694 --> 03:44:06.155]  And so it's like judo.
[03:44:06.155 --> 03:44:08.276]  It's a classic left-right paradigm.
[03:44:08.276 --> 03:44:15.661]  They're using an attack on the right wing of their sector, like a solar panel, to actually energize the other side of the wing.
[03:44:15.661 --> 03:44:16.341]  Exactly.
[03:44:16.341 --> 03:44:17.622]  Exactly.
[03:44:17.622 --> 03:44:24.106]  And I don't think somebody as smart as a Rhodes Scholar would accidentally do that.
[03:44:24.106 --> 03:44:25.807]  I mean, she has to know what she's doing.
[03:44:26.485 --> 03:44:31.508]  Well, I've talked to her privately, and she's really friendly, like a great saleswoman.
[03:44:31.508 --> 03:44:35.130]  And she's like, oh, please send me all that info, Alex.
[03:44:35.130 --> 03:44:36.571]  Thank you so much.
[03:44:36.571 --> 03:44:38.432]  But I can tell it is a mask.
[03:44:39.426 --> 03:44:41.167]  And I'm going to get her back on.
[03:44:41.167 --> 03:44:43.729]  Maybe I should get her back on and have you on with her.
[03:44:43.729 --> 03:44:45.410]  Well, I would love to talk to her.
[03:44:45.410 --> 03:44:47.231]  I would love to sit down and meet her.
[03:44:47.231 --> 03:44:50.213]  You know, there's always the chance that we're wrong or that I'm wrong.
[03:44:50.213 --> 03:44:55.336]  Well, there's always the chance that they see what's happening and they want to turn back.
[03:44:55.336 --> 03:44:56.297]  But you're right.
[03:44:56.297 --> 03:44:59.319]  She would then be attacking the whole left side of the paradigm.
[03:44:59.319 --> 03:45:01.760]  Yes, she should be because there's no difference.
[03:45:01.760 --> 03:45:06.063]  But the good news is everywhere she goes now, as I've seen the YouTubes, that's being brought up to her.
[03:45:06.900 --> 03:45:07.420]  Oh, it is.
[03:45:07.420 --> 03:45:08.141]  By leftists.
[03:45:08.141 --> 03:45:14.145]  They're going... I mean, are you not seeing what I'm... I mean, I just want your opinion because I don't know.
[03:45:14.145 --> 03:45:19.648]  I'm finally seeing the left, like never before, break their chains and become liberty lovers and get past these labels.
[03:45:19.648 --> 03:45:20.949]  They're buying guns.
[03:45:20.949 --> 03:45:22.991]  They understand the government's bad.
[03:45:22.991 --> 03:45:26.873]  They understand any government funding that's given is going to go to corporations.
[03:45:26.873 --> 03:45:29.755]  They finally, you know, they finally, I think, are getting it.
[03:45:30.672 --> 03:45:32.273]  Well, you mean at the grassroots level?
[03:45:32.273 --> 03:45:32.973]  Yes.
[03:45:32.973 --> 03:45:43.740]  Yes, no doubt at the grassroots, but up there at the higher elevations where you need oxygen, debris, those guys know exactly what's going on.
[03:45:43.740 --> 03:45:44.720]  How do they do that?
[03:45:44.720 --> 03:45:45.781]  Because, you know,
[03:45:46.957 --> 03:45:53.385]  You talk about how first they ignore you, then they attack you, or first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win.
[03:45:53.385 --> 03:45:56.870]  As Gandhi said, I kind of had it in reverse.
[03:45:56.870 --> 03:45:58.992]  These headhunters, in 1998, even 1997, I had like
[03:46:02.617 --> 03:46:19.061]  People call me, uh, who were big shot Democrats when I was attacking Bill Clinton, and then I'd find out who they were, and, you know, they would say, well, meet with me, but you've got to promise not to say we met, and so I can't say their names, I always, you know, follow my word, unless it's something criminal, and then you meet with this famous Democrat,
[03:46:19.819 --> 03:46:32.576]  Or you meet with another person and you know this has happened maybe five six times and then later it was corporate offers of millions of dollars to you know be basically a right winger and put out kind of a new hardcore brand of Rush Limbaugh.
[03:46:32.576 --> 03:46:35.320]  I mean I turned down you know 600 stations basically.
[03:46:35.320 --> 03:46:36.561]  I was going to be tested out in
[03:46:38.399 --> 03:46:42.182]  And I guess most people, you just give them the offer that they just want that money.
[03:46:42.182 --> 03:46:43.523]  But money doesn't matter to me.
[03:46:43.523 --> 03:46:46.605]  It's ideas that I traffic in.
[03:46:46.605 --> 03:46:47.586]  It's history.
[03:46:47.586 --> 03:46:48.807]  It's humanity.
[03:46:48.807 --> 03:46:49.928]  It's the species.
[03:46:49.928 --> 03:46:51.168]  It's my children.
[03:46:51.168 --> 03:46:52.429]  I serve ideals.
[03:46:52.429 --> 03:46:55.652]  I guess they see me as a foolish romantic.
[03:46:55.652 --> 03:46:59.254]  But everything we've got was built on romanticism.
[03:46:59.254 --> 03:47:00.575]  God bless you, Alex.
[03:47:00.575 --> 03:47:03.958]  That's exactly the spirit of America that we need to revive.
[03:47:06.089 --> 03:47:12.031]  Well, I just can't... I mean, they generate fiat money out of nothing, and then they buy the world with it.
[03:47:12.031 --> 03:47:13.832]  It's such a scam!
[03:47:13.832 --> 03:47:17.873]  Well, it is a scam, but it works, and it's very frustrating to all of us.
[03:47:17.873 --> 03:47:23.895]  In fact, every once in a while, I still go through that dark night where you wonder, is this really worth it?
[03:47:23.895 --> 03:47:27.056]  Is humanity capable of salvaging itself?
[03:47:27.679 --> 03:47:33.702]  And of course, when the sun rises in the morning, you always say, yes, you bet, and I'm going to be part of it, and you charge back into it.
[03:47:33.702 --> 03:47:45.229]  But boy, it gets awfully discouraging at times, because people, you know, you look around, and even in your closest circle of friends, and even some in your family, you think, well, these are excellent people.
[03:47:45.229 --> 03:47:51.913]  And yet, you see them kind of sell out when it comes time to get a job, for example.
[03:47:51.913 --> 03:47:53.153]  I've seen people work for
[03:47:55.152 --> 03:47:58.518]  Well let's just be specific for the pharmaceutical industry.
[03:47:58.518 --> 03:48:05.751]  Beautiful people I know and yet they're out there selling these drugs and you know deep down underneath they know that they're hurting people.
[03:48:05.751 --> 03:48:07.534]  But boy is that pay good!
[03:48:08.058 --> 03:48:11.419]  And is that car that the company provides, is it nice?
[03:48:11.419 --> 03:48:17.300]  And boy, these trips they take to the South Pacific Islands, all paid for by the company.
[03:48:17.300 --> 03:48:18.580]  Can you turn that down?
[03:48:18.580 --> 03:48:19.600]  But it's all hollow.
[03:48:19.600 --> 03:48:21.941]  I mean, I want to feel good about myself.
[03:48:21.941 --> 03:48:25.121]  I want to know that I'm helping humanity.
[03:48:25.121 --> 03:48:29.742]  And, you know, these yuppies think they can just basically poop everywhere.
[03:48:29.742 --> 03:48:31.263]  I hate to use that analogy, but that's what it is.
[03:48:31.263 --> 03:48:33.763]  And then it won't soil their own nest.
[03:48:33.763 --> 03:48:36.964]  When nobody cares about anybody, everything falls apart.
[03:48:36.964 --> 03:48:37.664]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:48:38.635 --> 03:48:45.958]  Well, as I said before, fortunately we don't need 51% of the population to have their heads screwed on, right?
[03:48:45.958 --> 03:48:54.041]  If we can just get 3% or even 2% who understand and who are willing to dedicate a significant portion of their lives to this thing,
[03:48:54.699 --> 03:48:56.520]  We can recapture the program.
[03:48:56.520 --> 03:48:57.801]  We can't turn it around.
[03:48:57.801 --> 03:48:58.081]  I agree.
[03:48:58.081 --> 03:49:00.563]  Let's jam a call and we'll come back and take a bunch of them.
[03:49:00.563 --> 03:49:03.364]  Richard, where are you calling us from today?
[03:49:03.364 --> 03:49:04.345]  Omaha, Nebraska.
[03:49:04.345 --> 03:49:05.285]  Welcome, sir.
[03:49:05.285 --> 03:49:15.752]  Yeah, last night on Educational Network, Point of View, they had a special about privatization of prisons.
[03:49:15.752 --> 03:49:20.735]  And where they went into detail were what's called corporations.
[03:49:21.722 --> 03:49:22.043]  I don't
[03:49:41.249 --> 03:49:42.530]  Guards and everything.
[03:49:42.530 --> 03:49:48.374]  Sir, sir, sir, a battery in your backyard speeding will now be six months a year in prison.
[03:49:48.374 --> 03:49:48.975]  Yeah.
[03:49:48.975 --> 03:49:51.397]  I mean, uh, G. Eber Griffin, you want to comment on that?
[03:49:51.397 --> 03:49:52.938]  We'll hold you over into the break.
[03:49:52.938 --> 03:49:53.498]  Well, sure.
[03:49:53.498 --> 03:50:06.148]  That's the trend, of course, is to get all of these legitimate functions of government, certainly prisons would be a legitimate function of government, to get it out of the political sphere so that the voters couldn't ever have any chance at reforming it, you know.
[03:50:06.328 --> 03:50:08.290]  And let's be clear, this isn't free market.
[03:50:08.290 --> 03:50:14.976]  We pay the tax money to a private group that just so happens to generally be owned by a money laundering drug cartel.
[03:50:14.976 --> 03:50:15.997]  And I'm surprised.
[03:50:15.997 --> 03:50:23.444]  Was James Dobson saying this was bad that the prisons go and then lobby for tougher laws to put more of us in their prisons?
[03:50:23.444 --> 03:50:25.586]  Well, I didn't catch that, Alex.
[03:50:25.586 --> 03:50:28.508]  No, I mean the listener, Richard.
[03:50:28.508 --> 03:50:29.389]  Richard, are you still there?
[03:50:29.389 --> 03:50:32.112]  I haven't kept up on him lately.
[03:50:33.243 --> 03:50:35.405]  Well, I mean, that's focus on the family you were talking about.
[03:50:35.405 --> 03:50:37.246]  I tell you what, stay there.
[03:50:37.246 --> 03:50:40.748]  Richard, I want to continue for InfoWars.com stream listeners.
[03:50:40.748 --> 03:50:42.910]  We're going to talk during this break so we don't waste time.
[03:50:42.910 --> 03:50:46.713]  With Richard and G. Edward Griffin, we'll come back on the other side with everybody else's calls.
[03:50:46.713 --> 03:50:48.114]  It is a big idea.
[03:50:48.114 --> 03:50:50.956]  A new world order.
[03:50:50.956 --> 03:50:56.039]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:50:56.039 --> 03:50:58.721]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:50:58.721 --> 03:51:00.843]  Put their objective being world domination.
[03:51:01.445 --> 03:51:04.628]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:51:04.628 --> 03:51:11.956]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:51:14.983 --> 03:51:20.407]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:51:20.407 --> 03:51:23.729]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:51:23.729 --> 03:51:26.851]  The Oval Party is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:51:26.851 --> 03:51:28.012]  Most people have no idea.
[03:51:28.012 --> 03:51:28.812]  They're not after money.
[03:51:28.812 --> 03:51:30.073]  They have all the money they need.
[03:51:30.073 --> 03:51:31.074]  They're after power.
[03:51:31.074 --> 03:51:32.215]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[03:53:52.837 --> 03:53:54.578]  We're gonna go 20 minutes into overdrive.
[03:54:10.916 --> 03:54:15.738]  We're going to go to Ray and Scott, but Abraham, Robert, I want to give you guys a local number.
[03:54:15.738 --> 03:54:17.558]  We'll go to you first.
[03:54:17.558 --> 03:54:18.899]  512-646-5400.
[03:54:18.899 --> 03:54:23.280]  We'll be turning that system on in about five minutes.
[03:54:23.280 --> 03:54:25.821]  That's, of course, 512-646-5400.
[03:54:25.821 --> 03:54:30.822]  In fact, you're welcome to call in on that right now.
[03:54:30.822 --> 03:54:39.525]  But you were making a point in the behind-the-scenes interview we were just doing with the InfoWars streams that everybody needs to tune to now, because we won't be on the AM or FM or shortwave.
[03:54:39.875 --> 03:54:45.681]  We'll just, or the satellite will just be at Infowars.com with the audio and PrisonPlanet.tv with the video.
[03:54:45.681 --> 03:54:47.423]  Would you ever grip him for another 20 minutes or so?
[03:54:47.423 --> 03:54:49.084]  We really appreciate him doing that.
[03:54:49.084 --> 03:54:52.948]  You were making the point about how, yeah, the private prisons are lobbying.
[03:54:52.948 --> 03:54:54.430]  That was just in the news the other day.
[03:54:54.430 --> 03:55:01.597]  I'm surprised it's on TV now, that they come and lobby and say, we need more people in prison because we've got private prisons we've opened.
[03:55:01.597 --> 03:55:02.278]  We need to fill them.
[03:55:03.092 --> 03:55:10.595]  And so now we see people being arrested for no turn signal, no seat belt, kids being CPS'd for the smallest of things.
[03:55:10.595 --> 03:55:15.497]  I mean, there's millions of new police and bureaucrats and they're going to find terrorists.
[03:55:15.497 --> 03:55:19.439]  And you talk about O'Brien torturing Winston, saying, hey, this isn't for criminals.
[03:55:19.439 --> 03:55:21.000]  Can you recap that?
[03:55:21.000 --> 03:55:27.042]  Yeah, in 1984, that book, 1984, by George Orwell, the point was made so well.
[03:55:27.042 --> 03:55:29.844]  O'Brien is the master criminal.
[03:55:29.844 --> 03:55:30.844]  He's working for the government.
[03:55:31.388 --> 03:55:36.771]  And he's torturing Winston, who is the good guy, and he's explaining the way that life really is.
[03:55:36.771 --> 03:55:38.212]  He says, Winston, come on.
[03:55:38.212 --> 03:55:38.773]  Wake up.
[03:55:38.773 --> 03:55:39.433]  Be real.
[03:55:39.433 --> 03:55:40.994]  This is the real world you're living in.
[03:55:40.994 --> 03:55:48.299]  And he says, you don't think we have laws in order to keep law and order or to enforce justice, do you?
[03:55:48.299 --> 03:55:49.019]  No, no, no.
[03:55:49.019 --> 03:55:50.220]  He says, Winston, come on.
[03:55:50.220 --> 03:55:50.560]  Wake up.
[03:55:50.990 --> 03:55:57.153]  We have so many laws so that we have so many of them that it's impossible not to break laws no matter what you do.
[03:55:57.153 --> 03:56:03.096]  If you get up in the morning you probably have broken five laws before you brush your teeth.
[03:56:03.096 --> 03:56:16.803]  The purpose of having so many laws is so that everybody becomes a criminal and now we have a reason for arresting anyone and we can control people because they're all criminals.
[03:56:16.803 --> 03:56:19.644]  And I think that's the idea that we're seeing it unfold right now.
[03:56:20.357 --> 03:56:21.199]  In their lives today.
[03:56:21.199 --> 03:56:23.683]  I saw something on the internet last night.
[03:56:23.683 --> 03:56:32.858]  Some poor bloke in the UK got arrested and he spent 18 hours in prison for dropping an apple core on the ground.
[03:56:34.505 --> 03:56:35.526]  That's what it's all about.
[03:56:35.526 --> 03:56:43.350]  It's all about getting total control, getting you in the system, and I think even a lot of police now realize and know this.
[03:56:43.350 --> 03:57:00.601]  I mean, every Roydhead I've seen at the gym, now I see his officers strutting down the street with, you know, deviled skulls tattooed all over them, just smiling with satanic pleasure that this is their time, I guess, and every town's gonna have ne'er-do-well goons in black uniforms.
[03:57:01.541 --> 03:57:06.263]  In fact, next hour, I want to tell you the story briefly, and then we'll go back to the calls.
[03:57:06.263 --> 03:57:21.148]  So for all the callers, Ray, Ann, Scott, and everybody else, just Abraham, Robert, call in right now at 512-646-5400, and you'll go to the head of the line for those callers that we're holding on Genesis lines.
[03:57:21.148 --> 03:57:23.929]  And I want to thank the network for the great job and all the affiliates and everything they do.
[03:57:25.109 --> 03:57:28.893]  But I have the footage of FEMA and Road to Tyranny saying the Founding Fathers are terrorists.
[03:57:28.893 --> 03:57:36.021]  I have the FBI training manuals with their phone numbers on it saying the Constitution's bad, people that talk about it are terrorists.
[03:57:36.021 --> 03:57:42.508]  And I have police squad car video where they arrest people for having pocket constitutions and state police stand there going, I think this is illegal.
[03:57:43.303 --> 03:57:49.910]  But at a Christian school in Texas, major university, they said you're not allowed to say the Bill of Rights and Constitution is good.
[03:57:49.910 --> 03:57:51.952]  It's now a terrorist document.
[03:57:51.952 --> 03:57:54.955]  I mean, it's so over the top.
[03:57:54.955 --> 03:57:56.237]  And I interviewed those guys.
[03:57:56.237 --> 03:57:58.959]  That rebroadcast is coming up in 20 minutes.
[03:57:58.959 --> 03:58:01.442]  But we're going to end the main network transmission now.
[03:58:01.442 --> 03:58:02.323]  We'll be back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[03:58:03.915 --> 03:58:18.660]  3 p.m., but if you want to hear these other calls and more from G. Edward Griffin, you'll want to go like tens of thousands of people are doing right now and listen at InfoWars.com on those streams and those streams alone, or you can watch us at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:58:18.660 --> 03:58:27.382]  We'll be right back on the other side in overdrive with G. Edward Griffin at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:27.382 --> 03:58:30.903]  You are listening to GCN.
[03:58:30.903 --> 03:58:32.764]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:36.246 --> 03:58:38.207]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[03:58:38.207 --> 03:58:41.809]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[03:58:41.809 --> 03:58:44.271]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[03:58:44.271 --> 03:58:47.313]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[03:58:47.313 --> 03:58:53.036]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[03:58:53.036 --> 03:58:56.959]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[03:58:57.279 --> 03:59:02.482]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[03:59:02.482 --> 03:59:05.523]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.
