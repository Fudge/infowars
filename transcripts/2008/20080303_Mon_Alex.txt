[00:00:05.814 --> 00:00:06.494]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.135 --> 00:00:08.195]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.896 --> 00:00:09.996]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.656 --> 00:00:11.477]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.237 --> 00:00:13.138]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.798 --> 00:00:17.540]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.082]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.503 --> 00:00:24.243]  Music
[00:00:36.322 --> 00:00:46.348]  I, well, thank you life, thank you love, and it is true there is some angels in this city.
[00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:48.690]  Thank you so, so much.
[00:00:50.111 --> 00:00:57.195]  Only a week ago, Marion Cotillard was making her acceptance speech at the Oscars after picking up a gong for Best Actress.
[00:00:57.735 --> 00:01:05.500]  Following on from a year where the 32-year-old French star earned under one million pounds, suddenly she was being ticked for big things.
[00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:16.606]  It was always inevitable that her Oscar success, after her portrayal of Edith Piaf in La Vie en Rose, would significantly increase her earning potential and her Hollywood influence.
[00:01:17.146 --> 00:01:22.909]  But it's possible Miss Cotillard has put both in jeopardy after comments she made in an interview in France.
[00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:31.814]  She referred to the two passenger jets flown into the World Trade Center, saying, We see other terrors of the same kind being hit by planes as they burned.
[00:01:32.233 --> 00:01:35.905]  There was a tower I believe it was in Spain which burned for 24 hours.
[00:01:36.326 --> 00:01:37.289]  It never collapsed.
[00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.774]  None of these towers collapsed.
[00:01:39.204 --> 00:01:41.685]  I think we're lied to about a number of things.
[00:01:42.325 --> 00:01:44.546]  Her conspiracy theory didn't end there.
[00:01:44.846 --> 00:01:47.347]  She also spoke of the American Space Program.
[00:01:47.727 --> 00:01:50.008]  She said, did a man really walk on the moon?
[00:01:50.468 --> 00:01:53.389]  I saw plenty of documentaries on it and I really wondered.
[00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.831]  And in any case, I don't believe all they tell me, that's for sure.
[00:01:57.411 --> 00:02:04.674]  The actress faces a potential backlash over her comments made on Paris Premiere, a program first broadcast a year ago.
[00:02:05.194 --> 00:02:06.755]  That's the type of propaganda that is on U.S.
[00:02:06.775 --> 00:02:08.275]  British television right now.
[00:02:08.295 --> 00:02:11.416]  How dare her have an opinion that it was an inside job?
[00:02:11.436 --> 00:02:13.137]  Her career is probably over now.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:49.790]  This is just desperate damage control trying to create a chilling effect image nationwide and worldwide that if you talk about 9-11 being a false flag attack, you are going to get fired.
[00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.011]  You're going to get blacklisted.
[00:02:52.031 --> 00:02:58.856]  McCarthy's going to come out of the grave and you're going to get blackballed.
[00:02:59.856 --> 00:03:02.058]  And notice, they don't want to go after the Italian president's
[00:03:02.918 --> 00:03:03.478]  We're good to go.
[00:03:03.518 --> 00:03:04.059]  We're good to go.
[00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:04.659]  We're good to go.
[00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:26.841]  She's French, and there's this ridiculous hatred of French.
[00:03:27.221 --> 00:03:33.405]  We've kind of picked up the British imperial view, the Anglophile view that they're all bad.
[00:03:33.666 --> 00:03:34.466]  It's a foreigner.
[00:03:34.526 --> 00:03:35.167]  It's a woman.
[00:03:35.227 --> 00:03:36.467]  It's a Hollywood person.
[00:03:36.828 --> 00:03:37.908]  It's a Frenchie.
[00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:39.249]  Man.
[00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.271]  Oh, so the media, hundreds and hundreds of articles.
[00:03:42.611 --> 00:03:44.292]  You type her name in in 9-11.
[00:03:44.693 --> 00:03:46.634]  This is as big as the Charlie Sheen thing.
[00:03:48.303 --> 00:03:50.105]  And they are really going after her.
[00:03:50.125 --> 00:03:51.226]  And I noticed they picked this.
[00:03:51.686 --> 00:03:54.749]  She said this actually about eight months ago, last year, in the middle of 2007.
[00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:00.393]  And she's since made other statements about the New World Order we've dug up.
[00:04:01.114 --> 00:04:02.215]  And so they're really mad at her.
[00:04:03.516 --> 00:04:05.758]  And I've talked to folks that do know her.
[00:04:05.878 --> 00:04:06.859]  She is with us.
[00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:08.080]  She's anti-New World Order.
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.681]  She's anti-globalist.
[00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:11.523]  She's a good person.
[00:04:12.303 --> 00:04:14.265]  And they are afraid of her.
[00:04:15.248 --> 00:04:16.890]  Notice, they didn't want to go after Willie Nelson.
[00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.151]  He's such an icon.
[00:04:18.471 --> 00:04:19.432]  Americana.
[00:04:19.632 --> 00:04:23.495]  So respected by the left and the right that they didn't go after him.
[00:04:23.555 --> 00:04:25.477]  I mean, O'Reilly called him a pinhead and that was it.
[00:04:27.179 --> 00:04:30.422]  No calls for him to be fired or lose money or boycott Willie Nelson.
[00:04:30.442 --> 00:04:31.262]  Plus, it's not going to work.
[00:04:32.503 --> 00:04:33.965]  And they tried to get the Dixie Chicks.
[00:04:33.985 --> 00:04:35.446]  They like to pick on girls.
[00:04:36.061 --> 00:04:37.462]  But that blew up in their face, didn't it?
[00:04:37.882 --> 00:04:44.888]  So another brazen attempt at chilling effect and censorship, blowing up in your dirty, murdering faces, you neocons.
[00:04:44.908 --> 00:04:45.688]  We'll go over this.
[00:04:46.048 --> 00:04:49.751]  We'll go over oil at all-time record highs, gold at all-time record highs.
[00:04:50.572 --> 00:04:56.356]  Gold is $985, $985-plus surging upwards.
[00:04:57.257 --> 00:05:00.139]  Colombia is on the verge of going to war with Venezuela.
[00:05:00.179 --> 00:05:00.960]  It's all coming up.
[00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.463]  It is a big idea, a new world order,
[00:05:06.207 --> 00:05:11.069]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:05:11.109 --> 00:05:12.870]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.172]  Doesn't their objective be world domination?
[00:05:16.732 --> 00:05:19.153]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:19.894 --> 00:05:27.317]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:30.239 --> 00:05:35.201]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:35.701 --> 00:05:39.144]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:39.564 --> 00:05:42.066]  Build-A-Bear is making great progress toward a world of government.
[00:05:42.126 --> 00:05:43.266]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:43.286 --> 00:05:44.047]  They're not after money.
[00:05:44.067 --> 00:05:45.128]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:45.348 --> 00:05:46.088]  They're after power.
[00:05:46.328 --> 00:05:47.349]  That's what they have to do.
[00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:55.675]  Order Endgame on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:05:55.975 --> 00:05:58.677]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:05:59.017 --> 00:06:00.138]  You have been warned.
[00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:05.784]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming and the end of the world?
[00:06:06.124 --> 00:06:08.006]  You shall hear of wars and rumors of wars.
[00:06:08.186 --> 00:06:11.249]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[00:06:11.429 --> 00:06:14.552]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[00:06:14.872 --> 00:06:16.714]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[00:06:16.974 --> 00:06:20.676]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[00:06:20.956 --> 00:06:23.617]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[00:06:23.637 --> 00:06:28.499]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[00:06:28.739 --> 00:06:33.041]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[00:06:33.441 --> 00:06:37.763]  The Bible says, would like you to receive this new offer, packet B, the unholy alliance.
[00:06:38.083 --> 00:06:42.325]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.

[00:06:46.247 --> 00:06:51.270]  As always, these materials are shipped to you at no charge.

[00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:52.711]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[00:06:52.732 --> 00:06:53.652]  And ask for Packet B.
[00:07:01.275 --> 00:07:05.536]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:07:05.796 --> 00:07:10.697]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:07:10.897 --> 00:07:12.238]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:07:12.398 --> 00:07:15.878]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?
[00:07:16.018 --> 00:07:21.180]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% of the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.

[00:07:27.521 --> 00:07:29.963]  Now, Calvin soaps are available to you and me.
[00:07:30.043 --> 00:07:32.345]  Triple concentrated for all your cleaning needs.

[00:07:37.388 --> 00:07:40.310]  I use them and love them, knowing they're all natural and safe.
[00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:41.731]  And I save big time.

[00:07:43.012 --> 00:07:43.372]  That's 1-800-340-7091.

[00:07:53.479 --> 00:08:00.001]  Again, that number, 1-800-340-7091, 5starsoap.com, for all your cleaning needs.
[00:08:02.382 --> 00:08:07.924]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:19.804 --> 00:08:26.669]  Tomorrow is the second big Super Tuesday in the last few major presidential contests.
[00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:39.259]  Things were pretty much sewn up by both the Republican and Democratic frontrunners by the end of the first Super Tuesday.
[00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:47.025]  This is the first time in decades, really since the early 60s, with Kennedy and LBJ.
[00:08:48.357 --> 00:08:58.019]  On the same ticket against Richard Milhouse, Nixon, that Texas has been a major player.
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:15.343]  Now, it does seem somewhat schizophrenic on air that I'm saying, you know, there's massive coast-to-coast election fraud, there's scams, these major candidates have been selected by the establishment,
[00:09:16.861 --> 00:09:18.703]  And so what is the big deal?
[00:09:19.023 --> 00:09:19.663]  Who cares?
[00:09:21.084 --> 00:09:23.486]  Well, we still have to analyze the race.
[00:09:23.526 --> 00:09:38.778]  We still have to break down the different tactics they're using as we dissect it and lay bare the fact that there isn't a dime's worth of difference between Hillary, Rodham Clinton, and Barack Obama, at least on the surface.
[00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:44.763]  I have to say that Hillary overall, and nobody has a crystal ball,
[00:09:45.913 --> 00:09:46.673]  At least no mortal.
[00:09:48.934 --> 00:09:53.956]  That if Hillary got into office, she would have more baggage, more corruption behind her.
[00:09:54.016 --> 00:09:55.457]  People already don't trust her.
[00:09:55.797 --> 00:10:05.380]  It'd be easier to block her, easier to expose her, easier to beat her socialist eugenics, government control, forced inoculations.
[00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:10.702]  See, people who argue against socialist health care, they argue and say, government can't deliver good health care.
[00:10:10.722 --> 00:10:12.103]  They'll bankrupt the economy.
[00:10:13.644 --> 00:10:15.224]  It doesn't work in Europe.
[00:10:15.264 --> 00:10:16.405]  They ration health care.
[00:10:16.825 --> 00:10:17.846]  Forget all that.
[00:10:18.046 --> 00:10:19.446]  Yeah, those are reasons to be against it.
[00:10:19.846 --> 00:10:23.648]  What about the fact that government wants to force poisons and toxins on you?
[00:10:23.948 --> 00:10:29.851]  What about the fact that they're saying they'll deny health care to the old through bioethics, which is just neo-eugenics?
[00:10:30.792 --> 00:10:33.033]  What about the fact that it'll give them all this control?
[00:10:33.753 --> 00:10:37.175]  You see, people aren't even aware of just how serious all this is.
[00:10:37.735 --> 00:10:40.036]  Barack Obama is very charismatic.
[00:10:41.087 --> 00:10:42.768]  He has called for a new world order.
[00:10:43.408 --> 00:10:44.189]  I've never seen this.
[00:10:44.249 --> 00:10:48.891]  I was going around on YouTube and heard him go, the type of world order, the type of world system we want.
[00:10:50.511 --> 00:10:55.774]  I forgot to... No, actually, I did send that clip to John, but it's part of a larger 10-minute clip we'll maybe play today if we have time.
[00:10:57.055 --> 00:10:59.416]  I mean, he has all these horrible advisors behind him.
[00:10:59.456 --> 00:11:00.656]  He's incredibly corrupt.
[00:11:01.857 --> 00:11:06.619]  Then you've got Hillary, just as bad or worse, but at least we know who she is.
[00:11:06.679 --> 00:11:08.620]  More people are the jigs up on her.
[00:11:09.538 --> 00:11:19.847]  Then we have McCain, who's for open borders, gun bans, socialized health care to some extent, but not as much as Obama and Hillary.
[00:11:20.448 --> 00:11:27.314]  But I'm here to tell you, we're getting two to one in most states, Democratic registration and voting.
[00:11:27.954 --> 00:11:29.996]  We have the Democrats coming out in force.
[00:11:30.949 --> 00:11:32.471]  The Republicans are dead ducks.
[00:11:32.511 --> 00:11:35.473]  They've collected about half the money that the Democrats have done.
[00:11:36.014 --> 00:11:41.819]  Clearly, the country is leaning in a big way towards Democrats.
[00:11:41.899 --> 00:11:43.921]  It's going to be a Democrat that gets elected.
[00:11:44.621 --> 00:11:52.528]  Barring Barack Obama or Hillary become the nominee, and you find out they've got literally dead children buried in their backyards.
[00:11:53.172 --> 00:12:05.677]  Barring something like that, and that may happen, you know, it may come out that they're on the payroll of communist generals that's already known with Hillary, or it may come out that Barack really, you know, is a Wahhabist Muslim CIA or something.
[00:12:05.977 --> 00:12:07.397]  I mean, anything could come out.
[00:12:08.078 --> 00:12:11.539]  There's definitely smoke, and where there's smoke, there's fire on both of them.
[00:12:11.559 --> 00:12:17.081]  And then the establishment gets their CFR, world government pushing McCain in.
[00:12:17.984 --> 00:12:19.826]  So either way, the new world order wins.
[00:12:20.226 --> 00:12:21.167]  It's locked in.
[00:12:21.807 --> 00:12:23.769]  But the good news is this.
[00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:26.131]  They have sold the public.
[00:12:27.443 --> 00:12:31.144]  That, at least to some extent, that Barack Obama wants change.
[00:12:31.484 --> 00:12:34.185]  The people want to bring the country back together again.
[00:12:34.205 --> 00:12:35.465]  He can do that.
[00:12:35.545 --> 00:12:37.065]  The country is divided.
[00:12:37.085 --> 00:12:42.366]  The country has never been more divided along party lines.
[00:12:42.446 --> 00:12:45.507]  Well, if you actually look at the polls, it's not along party lines.
[00:12:45.627 --> 00:12:52.449]  Both parties have the lowest approval rating since polling started over 100 years ago, depending on the poll, between 10 and 20%.
[00:12:54.119 --> 00:12:55.180]  But most polls show about 11%.
[00:12:56.101 --> 00:12:58.703]  So they've got about an 11% approval rating.
[00:12:59.323 --> 00:13:01.165]  And I talk about this a lot because it's key.
[00:13:01.585 --> 00:13:03.386]  And I hope you'll repeat this to others.
[00:13:03.406 --> 00:13:04.507]  This is key to understand.
[00:13:04.547 --> 00:13:05.228]  It's very simple.
[00:13:06.689 --> 00:13:11.373]  Before the establishment did, at least since the 50s, own both parties outright.
[00:13:12.373 --> 00:13:14.495]  And if Kennedy tried to get up with him, they just blew his head off.
[00:13:15.376 --> 00:13:16.357]  Oh, you think you're the president?
[00:13:16.377 --> 00:13:16.437]  Die.
[00:13:16.497 --> 00:13:16.797]  Die.
[00:13:19.085 --> 00:13:19.986]  We're good to go.
[00:13:20.026 --> 00:13:20.206]  I think?
[00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:48.918]  And so now the New World Order architects have tailored this campaign around, they're talking about 70% of people coming out and voting in this national election.
[00:13:48.938 --> 00:13:49.638]  That's what they're trending.
[00:13:50.058 --> 00:14:00.720]  They're talking about 80% turnout in Texas in this primary, 80% turnout in the two final big battleground states that Hillary needs.
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:05.241]  That's what they want.
[00:14:05.281 --> 00:14:07.001]  They want to suck you back in
[00:14:08.078 --> 00:14:14.202]  To believe in the process and to think you have a choice and then Obama can bring us back together.
[00:14:14.262 --> 00:14:17.945]  And when you hear back together, that means the people back under the control of the government.
[00:14:18.245 --> 00:14:21.527]  The people back under the control of buying their propaganda.
[00:14:21.788 --> 00:14:27.512]  The people back into being hoodwinked one more time so they can move the agenda down the field again.
[00:14:27.852 --> 00:14:33.656]  It may be four years, it may be six years until you wake up to Barack Obama, but by then they've already...
[00:14:34.516 --> 00:14:47.599]  Debased the dollar more, brought in another 20, 30 million illegal aliens, gotten in socialized health care, gotten in the Pentagon control grid of face-scanning cameras and national ID cards, had another staged terror attack, launched another war.
[00:14:50.339 --> 00:14:51.899]  So it's perfect for them.
[00:14:51.959 --> 00:14:56.840]  That's why they certainly tried to sell Hillary Clinton, the Democratic, the Republican machine.
[00:14:57.241 --> 00:14:59.381]  It looks like people regurgitated her.
[00:15:00.217 --> 00:15:00.317]  So...
[00:15:26.483 --> 00:15:27.865]  Again, people are going to say, well, wait a minute.
[00:15:27.885 --> 00:15:30.789]  You're saying we need to wake up and be involved in the voting process.
[00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:33.252]  We do to expose that it's a fraud.
[00:15:33.312 --> 00:15:38.139]  We do to stay engaged and to run Ron Paul type candidates locally.
[00:15:38.399 --> 00:15:39.601]  They can't shoot us everywhere.
[00:15:39.901 --> 00:15:41.323]  We are discrediting the machines.
[00:15:41.343 --> 00:15:42.505]  We are having them removed.
[00:15:42.865 --> 00:15:45.526]  But as fast as we have them removed, they have them put in in new areas.
[00:15:45.846 --> 00:15:47.126]  The fight starts over new.
[00:15:47.427 --> 00:15:50.288]  Now 85% of the American people know the machines are a fraud.
[00:15:50.588 --> 00:15:51.468]  We've had victories.
[00:15:51.808 --> 00:15:56.270]  Now the Federal Reserve being private and running a scam is a household term.
[00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:59.271]  It's being discussed all over MSNBC and CNN.
[00:16:00.231 --> 00:16:02.452]  People are talking about inflation tax now.
[00:16:02.752 --> 00:16:04.352]  They've learned about the Liberty Movement.
[00:16:04.552 --> 00:16:05.773]  Our ranks are swelling.
[00:16:06.033 --> 00:16:07.733]  This radio show is exploding.
[00:16:08.074 --> 00:16:12.155]  More and more stations are seeking us out, saying, we want to put you on air now.
[00:16:13.203 --> 00:16:28.753]  Just as a microcosm, my websites are exploding, everything's growing because of you believing in Ron Paul, taking action, making tens of thousands of YouTube videos, having tens of thousands of rallies, making millions of phone calls, calling into talk shows.
[00:16:30.485 --> 00:16:43.216]  None of that energy was dissipated or wasted unless you give up now and don't realize the victories we've had and buy their spin and propaganda that, oh, ha ha, you Paul Tards, as they call us, have been defeated.
[00:16:44.611 --> 00:16:47.373]  No, we have set up major beachheads in enemy territory.
[00:16:47.654 --> 00:16:50.876]  We have exposed and dug into their system deeply.
[00:16:51.237 --> 00:16:58.663]  We are literally, if this was a war, we have taken the high ground and we are burning the enemy emplacements as we enter the main city.
[00:16:59.243 --> 00:17:01.365]  Most major fortresses have three to four walls.
[00:17:01.625 --> 00:17:03.086]  We have breached the main wall.
[00:17:03.767 --> 00:17:08.030]  Now they've got more walls and we're going to have to breach those and it's going to get tougher and harder as we go.
[00:17:08.331 --> 00:17:10.332]  But don't you see we've breached them?
[00:17:10.632 --> 00:17:12.434]  We've blown giant holes in them.
[00:17:13.054 --> 00:17:13.495]  If you'll just...
[00:17:14.128 --> 00:17:19.050]  Crazed through the holes in just a crazed fashion.
[00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:20.611]  Wake everybody up.
[00:17:20.731 --> 00:17:21.791]  Redouble your efforts.
[00:17:21.831 --> 00:17:22.532]  Continue.
[00:17:22.952 --> 00:17:25.633]  We've exposed government-sponsored terror.
[00:17:25.913 --> 00:17:28.935]  The majority of Americans in major polls believe it's an inside job.
[00:17:29.535 --> 00:17:30.875]  It's now in the nomenclature.
[00:17:30.895 --> 00:17:32.596]  It's now in the vernacular.
[00:17:32.676 --> 00:17:34.037]  It's now used everywhere.
[00:17:35.057 --> 00:17:38.779]  There's no doubt they're having to back off stage terror because of what you have done.
[00:17:39.565 --> 00:17:48.587]  Willie Nelson and Best Actress and all these other people and all these other presidents in the Japanese Parliament and they're all talking about it.
[00:17:48.987 --> 00:17:50.908]  We're having incredible victories!
[00:17:52.408 --> 00:17:54.409]  And a lot of you don't realize that.
[00:17:54.449 --> 00:17:55.529]  This isn't overnight.
[00:17:55.589 --> 00:18:07.872]  This isn't pull up to McDonald's, sitting there tapping your foot, mad, because it's taken them 30 seconds to take your order and there's two cars in front of you and you're mad in three minutes and you drive through and cram down the hamburger.
[00:18:08.132 --> 00:18:09.132]  You're not satisfied.
[00:18:10.763 --> 00:18:13.024]  Okay, this is instant gratification.
[00:18:14.545 --> 00:18:21.589]  We're taking the steak and rubbing it with A1 and poking holes in it and sticking garlic into it and we're marinating it.
[00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.930]  And we're going to take it out.
[00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:27.433]  We're going to make a salad and baked potatoes and a bunch of other desserts and things.
[00:18:27.453 --> 00:18:28.513]  We're going to take them out on the grill.
[00:18:28.533 --> 00:18:29.274]  We're going to cook them.
[00:18:29.594 --> 00:18:30.955]  We're going to take our time eating it.
[00:18:32.498 --> 00:18:33.698]  That's how this is going to happen.
[00:18:34.219 --> 00:18:37.580]  This isn't going to happen like a bag of hamburgers out the window, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.681]  This is going to happen like a big Thanksgiving dinner you're putting on.
[00:18:42.582 --> 00:18:43.422]  Stuffing the turkey.
[00:18:43.962 --> 00:18:45.103]  They stuffed the turkey.
[00:18:45.323 --> 00:18:48.844]  It took them hundreds of years to get where they're at, and we're blowing holes in it.
[00:18:49.044 --> 00:18:50.384]  They're on the run globally.
[00:18:50.604 --> 00:18:51.965]  They're in trouble everywhere.
[00:18:53.146 --> 00:18:54.667]  They're losing all credibility.
[00:18:54.947 --> 00:18:56.448]  They've been exposed as criminals.
[00:18:57.009 --> 00:19:05.555]  And as long as we don't let them put other shills in there, and as long as we continue to show people the man behind the curtain, we're going to win this thing and we've got a chance.
[00:19:05.955 --> 00:19:07.637]  If we don't, it's over.
[00:19:08.497 --> 00:19:13.981]  And I want to kind of compose my thoughts, and later in the show, I am going to break down the choice we have.
[00:19:15.022 --> 00:19:20.326]  Literal survival of the species or very probable doom.
[00:19:21.818 --> 00:19:28.201]  Now, doom is probable down one path, but it is not probable down another.
[00:19:28.782 --> 00:19:36.326]  And so whether you're an FBI guy or a cop or a school teacher or a government bureaucrat or an oil baron, it doesn't matter.
[00:19:36.766 --> 00:19:38.487]  We're all in the same boat together.
[00:19:38.847 --> 00:19:44.570]  We need to assess how crazy this elite's gotten, how out of control this system's got, and where we're going.
[00:19:45.766 --> 00:19:47.589]  Okay, I'm going to get into the financial news.
[00:19:47.749 --> 00:19:52.416]  Then Venezuela is threatening to attack Colombia because Colombia just attacked their ally.
[00:19:53.138 --> 00:19:58.446]  It is just a totally jam-packed transmission today right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:20:02.836 --> 00:20:04.897]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:05.537 --> 00:20:14.439]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:14.899 --> 00:20:22.081]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:22.825 --> 00:20:26.687]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMed Inc.'
[00:20:26.667 --> 00:20:28.307]  's patented methodology.

[00:21:04.456 --> 00:21:05.516]  A new world order.
[00:21:06.217 --> 00:21:10.419]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:21:10.439 --> 00:21:12.880]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:16.202]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:21:16.722 --> 00:21:19.123]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:21:19.901 --> 00:21:27.234]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:21:30.248 --> 00:21:35.251]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:21:35.712 --> 00:21:39.174]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:21:39.574 --> 00:21:42.076]  Bill Vargas is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:21:42.136 --> 00:21:43.277]  Most people have no idea.
[00:21:43.297 --> 00:21:44.057]  They're not after money.
[00:21:44.077 --> 00:21:45.158]  They have all the money they need.
[00:21:45.338 --> 00:21:46.099]  They're after power.
[00:21:46.339 --> 00:21:47.460]  That's what they have to do.

[00:24:21.955 --> 00:24:29.980]  I tell you what, I'm going to get into what's happening in Venezuela and Colombia right now first.
[00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:35.483]  Then I'm going to get into the economy.
[00:24:50.825 --> 00:24:52.205]  There is so much news today.
[00:24:52.245 --> 00:24:54.166]  A bunch of really key audio clips.
[00:24:54.186 --> 00:24:55.646]  And I'm going to give you my take on 2012.
[00:24:56.946 --> 00:25:00.727]  Coming up at the start of the third hour, we have Jesse Benton in the last 30 minutes.
[00:25:01.227 --> 00:25:02.247]  Maybe Ron Paul.
[00:25:02.287 --> 00:25:03.988]  He's in intense campaigning right now.
[00:25:04.468 --> 00:25:06.048]  Definitely tomorrow, we're told.
[00:25:06.228 --> 00:25:06.868]  Maybe today.
[00:25:07.288 --> 00:25:10.029]  We have a big surprise guest coming up later in the week.
[00:25:10.109 --> 00:25:12.289]  I'm just going to leave it at that for you.
[00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:15.010]  Pretty excited about it, to say the least.
[00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:17.550]  You're like Willie Nelson, folks.
[00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:18.431]  You're going to like this.
[00:25:18.451 --> 00:25:19.951]  That's all I can say.
[00:25:22.466 --> 00:25:26.309]  Chavez sends tanks to Colombian border in dispute.
[00:25:26.869 --> 00:25:27.329]  Reuters.
[00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:42.599]  Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez moved tanks to the Colombian border and mobilized fighter jets on Sunday, warning Bogota could spark a war after its troops struck inside another of its neighbors, Ecuador.
[00:25:43.988 --> 00:25:59.515]  Reacting to Colombia's killing of Saturday, a Colombian rebel over the border of Ecuador, a Venezuelan ally, Chavez also withdrew all of his diplomats from Bogota in the worst dispute between the neighbors since he came into office in 1999.
[00:26:00.756 --> 00:26:06.338]  Mr. Defense Minister, move me ten battalions to the frontier with Colombia immediately.
[00:26:06.819 --> 00:26:07.619]  Tank battalions.
[00:26:08.129 --> 00:26:15.895]  The Air Force should mobilize, Chavez said, adding he will bolster his military's presence along the 1,400-mile border.
[00:26:17.356 --> 00:26:25.641]  May God spare us war, but we are not going to allow them to violate our sovereign territory, the ex-paratrooper added on his weekly TV show.
[00:26:26.542 --> 00:26:30.645]  Columbia's military said on Saturday troops killed Raul Reyes.
[00:26:31.463 --> 00:26:40.130]  A leader of the Marxist FARC rebels during an attack on a jungle camp in Ecuador in a severe blow to Latin America's oldest guerrilla insurgency.
[00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:44.674]  The operation included airstrikes and fighting with rebels across the frontier.
[00:26:45.494 --> 00:26:57.263]  The anti-US Chavez, who has warned of similar operation in Venezuela, would be a cause of war, threatened to send Russian-made fighter jets into US ally Colombia if its troops struck inside OPEC country.
[00:26:58.544 --> 00:27:00.406]  Let's just stop right here and analyze what's happening.
[00:27:02.034 --> 00:27:03.795]  Let's just coldly analyze this.
[00:27:03.835 --> 00:27:05.636]  Let's not side with the U.S.
[00:27:05.716 --> 00:27:08.598]  That means the private European banks that own us and use us as a whore.
[00:27:10.119 --> 00:27:14.561]  Or with the free speech attacking communist who's got his own big problems.
[00:27:14.981 --> 00:27:19.023]  Again, it isn't we're good, they're good, we're bad, they're bad.
[00:27:19.143 --> 00:27:19.944]  It's all bad.
[00:27:22.265 --> 00:27:24.006]  99% of the time, governments are run by evil.
[00:27:26.047 --> 00:27:27.308]  That's what history shows.
[00:27:27.328 --> 00:27:28.329]  It's what the Bible says.
[00:27:28.369 --> 00:27:30.750]  It's what common sense, what the philosophers said.
[00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:34.971]  Bad people who want power and are willing to kill people tend to get into control.
[00:27:37.292 --> 00:27:46.655]  Then they build up systems to maintain that control over their populations, and then it makes it easier for only bad people to stay in using those mechanisms afterwards.
[00:27:47.616 --> 00:27:48.516]  But I'm digressing.
[00:27:50.436 --> 00:27:51.817]  So I'm not even taking sides here.
[00:27:53.538 --> 00:28:00.400]  But because he is the underdog, you have to, and most people do, even conservatives, root for Hugo Chavez.
[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:10.605]  Because he isn't like a Soviet communist who would take 3 million Ukrainians off their land in one year and starve them to death.
[00:28:10.945 --> 00:28:15.308]  They actually did take land from the oil companies and actually did just give it to indigenous people that used to belong.
[00:28:15.348 --> 00:28:21.812]  And they actually are cutting taxes and then just making corporations, you know, the big mega ones that we're getting.
[00:28:22.693 --> 00:28:24.474]  Now, you see, communism, you look at the U.S.
[00:28:24.534 --> 00:28:26.375]  where we had a free market and a free society.
[00:28:26.695 --> 00:28:28.976]  Communism is really bad because we had a middle class.
[00:28:29.016 --> 00:28:29.957]  Why would you want communism?
[00:28:30.848 --> 00:28:37.312]  But when you look at a country where 98% of the people have nothing and 2% have it all, that's why communism is so easy to sell to them.
[00:28:39.293 --> 00:28:43.216]  Then you get a dictator in and he only keeps half and gives you the other half.
[00:28:43.236 --> 00:28:45.377]  Well, that's better than him keeping 98%.
[00:28:45.737 --> 00:28:46.397]  See how that works?
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:55.423]  And you do get communists and socialists who actually believe in what they're doing.
[00:28:56.781 --> 00:28:58.382]  And the globalists always kill those.
[00:28:58.422 --> 00:29:01.145]  You get a Che Guevara who's misguided but means well.
[00:29:01.545 --> 00:29:02.746]  Fidel kicks him out of Cuba.
[00:29:02.766 --> 00:29:03.687]  The CIA kills him.
[00:29:05.448 --> 00:29:07.790]  You get the Trotskyites who believe in what they're doing.
[00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:08.531]  They're kicked out.
[00:29:10.292 --> 00:29:11.833]  And the Soviets hunt them down and kill them.
[00:29:14.856 --> 00:29:17.998]  It's the same story over and over and over and over again.
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.422]  The bankers want to work with corrupt communist leaders.
[00:29:23.556 --> 00:29:28.501]  So when we get back, I'm going to break this down, what all this really means, what this ties in with.
[00:29:28.521 --> 00:29:32.925]  This could be the start of a U.S.-led war down there, and there's no doubt that's what's happening.
[00:29:33.705 --> 00:29:37.349]  And this same FARC leader met with the head of the New York Stock Exchange in 1999.
[00:29:38.029 --> 00:29:43.114]  Publicly, the head of the Stock Exchange went down and publicly said, invest your cocaine money with us or we're going to kill you.
[00:29:44.295 --> 00:29:46.217]  Well, they said no, and now they're dying.
[00:29:47.143 --> 00:29:51.486]  And the government's going to SWAT team you looking for drugs when they publicly ask them to invest their money.
[00:29:51.826 --> 00:29:52.786]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.227 --> 00:29:54.828]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.768 --> 00:29:58.450]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.693 --> 00:30:10.938]  For veterans of all branches of the United States military, HempUSA.org is offering a three-month sampler of our hemp products for increased digestion and immunity health of our returning veterans.
[00:30:11.218 --> 00:30:17.202]  At HempUSA.org, we feel a sense of urgency for the returning troops to try the most densely nutrient food on the planet.
[00:30:17.342 --> 00:30:22.505]  This raw food will rebalance all of their body systems and push all toxins that are found in all of the returning soldiers.
[00:30:22.725 --> 00:30:30.774]  We at HempUSA.org feel the need to let the soldier's past, present, and future know about this great urgency to detoxify the body before it can heal itself.
[00:30:31.054 --> 00:30:38.823]  The body, if given the proper nutrients, will always heal itself mentally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually by calling 908-691-2608 and ordering
[00:30:41.886 --> 00:30:43.227]  Or go to hempusa.org today.
[00:31:01.522 --> 00:31:03.004]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond.
[00:31:03.344 --> 00:31:08.830]  You can now get the most important package ever on what has happened to the Catholic Church in the last 50 years.
[00:31:09.331 --> 00:31:12.875]  Find out how this massive crisis concerning the Catholic Church happened.
[00:31:13.295 --> 00:31:13.836]  What happened?
[00:31:14.147 --> 00:31:15.368]  That's mostholyfamilymonastery.com
[00:31:33.206 --> 00:31:37.087]  The last word monastery is spelled M-O-N-A-S-T-E-R-Y.
[00:31:37.427 --> 00:31:37.887]  Or call us at 1-800-275-1126.
[00:31:37.907 --> 00:31:38.107]  That's 1-800-275-1126.
[00:31:38.127 --> 00:31:40.908]  Or mail in your order to us at 4425 Schneider Road, Fillmore, New York 14735.
[00:31:41.308 --> 00:31:44.989]  The total cost for this massive package of information is only $10.
[00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:46.509]  $15 for UPS Crown or $30 outside the U.S.
[00:32:00.825 --> 00:32:01.125]  Fact.
[00:32:01.306 --> 00:32:07.212]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[00:32:07.332 --> 00:32:11.596]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[00:32:11.676 --> 00:32:19.163]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[00:32:20.164 --> 00:32:28.308]  Detoxification works with Electro-C Premier Energy Foot Spa because it addresses the needs of individual cells, the building blocks of human life.
[00:32:28.328 --> 00:32:31.270]  For mental clarity, restored vitality, a stronger immune system, clear skin,
[00:32:46.497 --> 00:32:48.098]  Before you slip into unconsciousness, I...
[00:33:11.241 --> 00:33:15.205]  We're back live, my friends.
[00:33:15.605 --> 00:33:23.793]  Thank you for joining us today.
[00:33:41.052 --> 00:33:44.836]  We're going to have open phones in the second and into the third hour.
[00:33:44.856 --> 00:33:49.420]  We'll be covering a lot of news and playing some important audio clips.
[00:33:50.982 --> 00:33:53.784]  Let me continue with the news here.
[00:33:56.007 --> 00:34:05.516]  So we have Colombia, the narco-terrorist state where they literally line anybody up that disagrees with the government, machine gun them, our government supports all that, death squads.
[00:34:07.006 --> 00:34:09.268]  I mean, far more oppressive than Hugo Chavez.
[00:34:09.288 --> 00:34:10.208]  And I'm not defending him.
[00:34:10.268 --> 00:34:13.711]  He's getting worse and worse himself about restricting free speech and things.
[00:34:14.632 --> 00:34:17.754]  Though it comes out it is the CIA running the operations.
[00:34:17.814 --> 00:34:20.936]  But you have to allow that and then just counter with your own free speech.
[00:34:22.838 --> 00:34:29.723]  But he has now sent 10 battalions to the frontier with Columbia tank battalions.
[00:34:29.743 --> 00:34:31.224]  The Air Force has been mobilized.
[00:34:32.885 --> 00:34:35.467]  And this is all because...
[00:34:36.221 --> 00:34:45.906]  Venezuela went in and bombed and attacked and blew the daylights out of Ecuador, which Chavez, of course, and Venezuela have a defense treaty with.
[00:34:47.267 --> 00:34:54.090]  Now, the Colombian FARC are from Colombia, and they have been fighting with the government there for more than 20 years.
[00:34:56.751 --> 00:35:01.874]  But as soon as I saw this report this morning, I went, Google time.
[00:35:03.334 --> 00:35:07.097]  And I did the research, and I sent it to Nemo and Paul and Steve and asked one of them.
[00:35:07.237 --> 00:35:10.680]  I'm sure one of them will do a story on this and add their own intellect and information.
[00:35:12.982 --> 00:35:22.149]  But I remembered the AP photo, and I remember photos, and I remember making a big deal about it in 1999 on air.
[00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:29.095]  And I remember it even getting on the news, on a few TV news stations, and they said it was good.
[00:35:29.915 --> 00:35:36.565]  That Richard Grasso, the head of the New York Stock Exchange, a former CIA spook, of course, himself.
[00:35:36.605 --> 00:35:37.186]  They always are.
[00:35:37.206 --> 00:35:37.967]  They run Wall Street.
[00:35:38.347 --> 00:35:40.610]  It's all insider trading, their own private cash machine.
[00:35:41.632 --> 00:35:42.413]  It's not free market.
[00:35:43.214 --> 00:35:44.416]  It's all about suckering you.
[00:35:47.134 --> 00:35:52.720]  Went down to meet with the FARC and literally photos with him landing in a helicopter, hugging the leaders.
[00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:54.462]  They got their big Marxist beards.
[00:35:55.082 --> 00:35:55.923]  They're old guys.
[00:35:56.524 --> 00:36:03.831]  And saying, invest your hundreds of billions in cocaine money with the New York Stock Exchange and we'll leave you alone.
[00:36:06.078 --> 00:36:07.078]  I mean, this was publicly.
[00:36:07.139 --> 00:36:08.199]  Invest your drugs with us.
[00:36:08.339 --> 00:36:14.822]  And there's even a federal law saying that drug money is allowed from out of the country to be invested with banks.
[00:36:14.842 --> 00:36:17.223]  Did you know banks have it to where they're allowed to launder money?
[00:36:17.903 --> 00:36:20.404]  Oh yeah, they're not going to raid banks for laundering money.
[00:36:21.105 --> 00:36:27.087]  If you make a mistake on an income tax and mail it, they're going to call it mail fraud and give you ten years in prison.
[00:36:27.848 --> 00:36:30.309]  They don't use the racketeering laws on real criminals.
[00:36:32.407 --> 00:36:35.669]  And it's in federal law that they can invest drug money.
[00:36:35.949 --> 00:36:36.969]  That's how sick it is.
[00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:41.671]  The cops will be at a checkpoint wanting to search your car, looking for marijuana.
[00:36:43.232 --> 00:36:48.754]  And all these governments publicly invest their narcotics money in the stock market.
[00:36:49.715 --> 00:36:50.715]  Oh, it's so sick.
[00:36:50.815 --> 00:36:52.876]  You can only hurt them by not using their stuff, folks.
[00:36:52.916 --> 00:36:53.656]  Don't use their filth.
[00:36:53.696 --> 00:36:55.877]  Don't ever use it.
[00:36:58.419 --> 00:37:00.059]  So I thought I would dig this up.
[00:37:00.079 --> 00:37:01.540]  So I started doing Google searches.
[00:37:03.687 --> 00:37:06.409]  Under Richard Grasso, New York Stock Exchange, FARC.
[00:37:08.731 --> 00:37:09.332]  Columbia.
[00:37:09.852 --> 00:37:10.413]  Drugs.
[00:37:10.693 --> 00:37:17.699]  And the best site I found was a foreign site.
[00:37:20.786 --> 00:37:21.547]  We're good to go.
[00:37:53.188 --> 00:37:54.889]  I'm going to give you a bunch of headlines here.
[00:37:56.929 --> 00:37:58.009]  This is out of Royers, 625.99.
[00:37:58.330 --> 00:37:58.490]  Okay, 625.99.
[00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:03.751]  And you can just type one line of this and it will come up, the actual article.
[00:38:10.071 --> 00:38:26.384]  The apparent fact that the Army always seems to show up when the FARC or other armed opposition group is engaged in fighting with the paramilitary seems to once again highlight the close nature of the relationship between the Colombian security forces and the paramilitary, notes Carlos Salinas, head of the American section of Amnesty International.
[00:38:26.665 --> 00:38:27.745]  Oh, that was the wrong Reuters.
[00:38:27.826 --> 00:38:28.626]  Where's my Reuters?
[00:38:28.646 --> 00:38:29.507]  There's so many of these.
[00:38:31.716 --> 00:38:34.237]  Reuters, Miami Herald, AP.
[00:38:34.617 --> 00:38:35.037]  Oh, Reuters.
[00:38:35.077 --> 00:38:35.418]  I'm sorry.
[00:38:35.438 --> 00:38:35.938]  I was reading you.
[00:38:36.138 --> 00:38:37.538]  There's so many footnotes here.
[00:38:37.859 --> 00:38:40.700]  And again, you can Google any one of these and then find the specific article.
[00:38:42.641 --> 00:38:49.183]  Anna Cole reported that Grasso extended a personal invitation to leaders of FARC, which is considered a terrorist organization by the U.S.
[00:38:49.243 --> 00:38:53.145]  State Department, to visit Wall Street as soon as possible.
[00:38:53.225 --> 00:38:55.326]  Quote, I invite the members of FARC.
[00:38:56.013 --> 00:39:01.556]  To visit the New York Stock Exchange so that they can get to know the market personally and invest there, and it goes on.
[00:39:02.197 --> 00:39:05.198]  Grasso was quoted as saying, I truly hope that they can do this.
[00:39:05.258 --> 00:39:10.201]  He added, ABC News, $626.99 from Reuters.
[00:39:13.123 --> 00:39:15.424]  Now, again, officer, let me tell you how to really investigate, okay?
[00:39:15.444 --> 00:39:20.047]  You just type in, Anna Cole reported that Grasso extended a personal invitation.
[00:39:20.387 --> 00:39:22.368]  That'll get you ABC and Reuters, okay?
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:24.980]  Here's another one, AP.
[00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:26.361]  All right, you ready for this?
[00:39:27.221 --> 00:39:28.442]  In early June, U.S.
[00:39:28.482 --> 00:39:41.626]  Congressional Representative William DeHunt, Democrat, M.A., also traveled to Columbia and met with the FARC spokesman, Ray, as said, $626.99 from AP.
[00:39:42.006 --> 00:39:44.787]  And they called for him to join the stock market and invest drug proceeds there.
[00:39:46.467 --> 00:39:47.948]  Here's Miami Herald.
[00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:56.501]  And it talks about how they asked them to invest their drug money there.
[00:39:56.921 --> 00:39:59.141]  Here's French news agencies saying the same thing.
[00:39:59.621 --> 00:40:05.562]  So, I only did 20 minutes of recapping research to go back and visit.
[00:40:05.923 --> 00:40:08.443]  As you can find the photo of him hugging the heads of FARC.
[00:40:08.923 --> 00:40:14.924]  Now, the number two, who would become the number one, was killed yesterday.
[00:40:17.665 --> 00:40:19.505]  Last night in bombing attacks.
[00:40:20.712 --> 00:40:21.512]  Now, the U.S.
[00:40:21.592 --> 00:40:40.739]  publicly went down there and said, just like they told the Taliban, a carpet of gold or a carpet of bombs, and they said, listen, we'll let you, you've taken over two-thirds of the country, you have two-thirds of production of cocaine, the biggest cocaine-producing country in the world, you invest your money with us and launder it here, this is public, and we won't invade.
[00:40:41.747 --> 00:40:46.570]  They said no, and in 2001, late 2000, everything was escalated.
[00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:47.490]  10,000 U.S.
[00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:52.153]  troops had been down there full-time running the entire operation that you just saw yesterday.
[00:40:53.594 --> 00:40:56.115]  Of course Chavez is involved in cocaine, too.
[00:40:56.155 --> 00:40:56.815]  They all are.
[00:40:56.875 --> 00:40:57.936]  It's legal down there.
[00:40:57.956 --> 00:40:59.017]  They just publicly grow it.
[00:41:02.519 --> 00:41:06.721]  And whenever he gets criticized for being involved in narcotics, he says, what, your government ships it all in, won't we?
[00:41:08.002 --> 00:41:10.483]  That's just like what happened in Panama.
[00:41:12.401 --> 00:41:12.962]  We're good to go.
[00:41:34.102 --> 00:41:59.416]  You know, 1998, the American people still believed anything and everything, and then we just heard, hey, that dirty Manuel Noriega, didn't matter if he'd been CIA his whole life, he just, we say he's bad, look at him, he looks like a toad, he's got pot marks, you know, he's ugly, he's had lots of acne, and he's down there somewhere in another part of the world, you can't find it on a map, Americans, you can't find your own country, but we just blew up three of their major cities.
[00:42:00.397 --> 00:42:05.141]  With A-10s and with C-130s with howitzers and Gatling guns.
[00:42:05.682 --> 00:42:08.024]  We just killed over 30,000 people in one night.
[00:42:08.044 --> 00:42:09.545]  We've been planning the invasion for a year.
[00:42:09.785 --> 00:42:11.627]  He quit laundering his money with us a year ago.
[00:42:11.647 --> 00:42:13.809]  Of course, that was all over the foreign press.
[00:42:14.029 --> 00:42:15.931]  They grabbed him, don't give him a trial stage at all.
[00:42:17.472 --> 00:42:21.135]  He stopped investing his cocaine money with the Wall Street.
[00:42:21.175 --> 00:42:21.896]  It was over, folks.
[00:42:21.936 --> 00:42:24.578]  It was an invasion in one year.
[00:42:25.262 --> 00:42:29.564]  And the Special Forces were down there for a year, and it's now on television, they admit it, preparing the invasion.
[00:42:29.844 --> 00:42:33.385]  But then when they're ready to do it, they tell you they kidnapped two of our girls.
[00:42:35.046 --> 00:42:44.030]  And they show two blondes on TV and then show this toad-like creature and say, look, this evil, dirty, brown person kidnapped our white women.
[00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:45.210]  Let's kill them.
[00:42:45.610 --> 00:42:49.712]  I mean, they punch our buttons to such an extent.
[00:42:49.812 --> 00:42:51.393]  You understand?
[00:42:51.633 --> 00:42:52.633]  This is admitted.
[00:42:53.994 --> 00:42:54.994]  This is not debated.
[00:42:55.876 --> 00:42:56.737]  Everything I'm telling you.
[00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:06.663]  C-130s just flying around in circles around their major cities, just blowing everything to bits.
[00:43:07.943 --> 00:43:09.765]  With howitzers hanging out the side.
[00:43:11.266 --> 00:43:12.486]  Artillery from the air.
[00:43:12.907 --> 00:43:17.509]  Huge Vulcan cannons firing giant rounds at them.
[00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:20.051]  Spewing thousands of them a second.
[00:43:22.967 --> 00:43:26.930]  We sure blew the daylights out of them!
[00:43:27.411 --> 00:43:28.672]  We're powerful!
[00:43:29.332 --> 00:43:30.273]  You're not powerful.
[00:43:30.333 --> 00:43:36.398]  The same criminal government that did that takes the IRS and takes your house, takes your farm, injects you full of deadly poison.
[00:43:38.139 --> 00:43:38.900]  Through eugenics.
[00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:41.162]  You don't run anything, good old boy.
[00:43:41.762 --> 00:43:45.285]  You're absolutely nothing to these people.
[00:43:46.366 --> 00:43:48.828]  And you need to start understanding that.
[00:43:49.208 --> 00:43:52.431]  And you need to start realizing that and stop feeling so tough
[00:43:54.079 --> 00:44:10.004]  The very people that ran these attacks and that attacked these innocent nations with dictators that the globalists put in who get out of line, they're the very people getting rid of our borders.
[00:44:10.024 --> 00:44:12.045]  They're the very people devaluing our dollars.
[00:44:13.266 --> 00:44:13.586]  We're good to go.
[00:44:27.375 --> 00:44:31.157]  To the Arabs and the Europeans and the Latin Americans, all the kingpins.
[00:44:31.638 --> 00:44:32.898]  We're now a third world country.
[00:44:32.938 --> 00:44:33.959]  They treat us like one.
[00:44:34.199 --> 00:44:43.105]  They have the same looting policies here that we sat around giggling about happening in Asia, Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East.
[00:44:43.585 --> 00:44:45.386]  Is it fun to be treated like a colony?
[00:44:45.826 --> 00:44:47.267]  Is it fun to be strip-mined?
[00:44:49.369 --> 00:44:51.090]  Aggressively to destroy your future.
[00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:56.513]  So stop stumbling around acting cool and thinking you're Hulk Hogan.
[00:44:57.757 --> 00:45:01.979]  And sticking American flags on your car, which then means you support those that run our country.
[00:45:02.919 --> 00:45:06.980]  You're supporting the death of this nation.
[00:45:07.261 --> 00:45:10.942]  75% of the troops in every major poll and some it's higher have figured out this.
[00:45:10.982 --> 00:45:12.162]  That's why they're against the war.
[00:45:12.903 --> 00:45:19.085]  You, the 25% that still believe the official lie, are just absolute idiots.
[00:45:19.145 --> 00:45:19.785]  You're cowards.
[00:45:19.825 --> 00:45:21.246]  You can't admit you've been conned.
[00:45:22.446 --> 00:45:23.887]  I've been conned many times in life.
[00:45:24.127 --> 00:45:25.267]  I've been cheated in business.
[00:45:25.527 --> 00:45:26.548]  I've been taken for rides.
[00:45:26.768 --> 00:45:27.488]  I've been mugged.
[00:45:28.388 --> 00:45:30.109]  I've had girlfriends cheat on me.
[00:45:30.349 --> 00:45:31.650]  I've been screwed plenty of times.
[00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:32.490]  But you know what?
[00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:37.673]  I learned how to deal with it, and I learned how to learn from my mistakes.
[00:45:38.313 --> 00:45:39.674]  And now I don't put up with anything.
[00:45:40.374 --> 00:45:44.937]  It took me years to become hard-skinned and mean, but I am now.
[00:45:45.632 --> 00:45:52.577]  You need to stop being idiots and stop being so easy to fool and so easy to be lied to.
[00:45:52.597 --> 00:45:54.058]  Let me just give you the word.
[00:45:54.398 --> 00:45:55.979]  You've been played, chump.
[00:45:56.359 --> 00:45:57.560]  They're laughing at you.
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:12.169]  It's not cute to keep laughing back at me and posting death threats on our InfoWars message boards and in the comments and laughing about how you're with CENTCOM and how you're going to get us and, yeah, you've trained for martial law and it's funny because I'm a Muslim lover and I'm going to get it.
[00:46:12.409 --> 00:46:13.190]  You idiot!
[00:46:14.048 --> 00:46:21.674]  They're backing the Muslim Wahhabist right now in Lebanon over their government, trying to bring them down against the Shiites.
[00:46:22.234 --> 00:46:25.017]  They're using Wahhabists to attack Iran right now.
[00:46:25.297 --> 00:46:31.462]  They're using Wahhabists to destabilize Afghanistan as a pretext to keep our troops there to fight over the opium.
[00:46:32.803 --> 00:46:34.304]  By the way, the prices just went up again.
[00:46:35.365 --> 00:46:38.267]  Six-year liberation, all-time record high.
[00:46:39.585 --> 00:46:42.726]  Opium's the highest price it's ever been, the largest amounts flooding out.
[00:46:42.746 --> 00:46:45.387]  So they have large supply, and they're bringing it right to your children.
[00:46:47.188 --> 00:46:57.011]  So what's this all about with Columbia attacking Ecuador, huge military assault, backed up by the U.S.
[00:46:57.071 --> 00:46:59.592]  admittedly, killing a bunch of fart gorillas?
[00:47:02.413 --> 00:47:03.513]  Now, they were good communists.
[00:47:03.554 --> 00:47:05.074]  Like Mao, they'd be put in power.
[00:47:05.114 --> 00:47:05.774]  They were given that deal.
[00:47:06.034 --> 00:47:06.875]  Mao took the deal.
[00:47:07.315 --> 00:47:07.655]  Mao and
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:10.442]  By 46 was fully under our control.
[00:47:10.482 --> 00:47:13.124]  Going back to by our, people that run our nation, I keep saying that.
[00:47:13.545 --> 00:47:15.206]  I've got to deprogram myself.
[00:47:16.487 --> 00:47:17.728]  Mao was fighting with the U.S.
[00:47:17.748 --> 00:47:18.929]  going back to 42.
[00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:23.533]  Back before it was even a division of the Flying Tigers and a division of the military.
[00:47:24.854 --> 00:47:25.775]  Attacking was Japanese.
[00:47:25.795 --> 00:47:26.916]  I'm not defending the Japanese either.
[00:47:26.936 --> 00:47:29.958]  The point is, did you know that really since 1940...
[00:47:31.531 --> 00:47:37.452]  A year before we got into the war, we had thousands of advisors there and fighter pilots going in and engaging.
[00:47:37.712 --> 00:47:38.873]  And, you know, U.S.
[00:47:38.893 --> 00:47:44.734]  fighter pilots joined the Chinese military under the Communists and were in there attacking people.
[00:47:47.855 --> 00:47:48.635]  They put Mao in.
[00:47:48.655 --> 00:47:50.075]  That's now declassified and admitted.
[00:47:50.395 --> 00:47:55.416]  And they said, all right, sterilize your people, kill masses of people, and you get the IMF World Bank funds.
[00:47:55.736 --> 00:47:57.517]  And Mao said, absolutely, exterminate.
[00:47:57.537 --> 00:47:57.977]  And they did it.
[00:48:00.586 --> 00:48:03.749]  They come to the FARC, and they say, we want you to do this.
[00:48:03.889 --> 00:48:05.931]  We have the treaties where they said do it, and now did it.
[00:48:07.292 --> 00:48:10.995]  We moved the globalists, moved their bases over there, moved all of our industry over there.
[00:48:11.035 --> 00:48:11.696]  They kept their deal.
[00:48:12.917 --> 00:48:14.338]  They came to the FARC in 1999.
[00:48:14.398 --> 00:48:23.686]  The head of the stock exchange landed, was on television, and everyone was saying, invest your money with us, and we'll pull our troops out.
[00:48:24.705 --> 00:48:28.506]  The FARC said no, and so their leader got killed yesterday.
[00:48:28.867 --> 00:48:37.470]  Photos of him hugging Richard Grasso, the former head of the New York Stock Exchange, when he was current head of the New York Stock Exchange.
[00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:46.753]  So our government sends down the head of the Stock Exchange, now owned by the Fox News, they now own the Dow Jones.
[00:48:47.953 --> 00:48:49.174]  They send them down there,
[00:48:50.535 --> 00:48:56.400]  To go directly to the head of the FARC, the biggest cocaine producers in the world, and say, invest with us and we'll work with you.
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:57.461]  And they say no.
[00:48:57.721 --> 00:49:01.064]  And so we've now been in an eight-year war.
[00:49:01.104 --> 00:49:03.126]  And by we, we're paying for it as taxpayers.
[00:49:03.266 --> 00:49:04.487]  Our sons are there dying.
[00:49:05.568 --> 00:49:09.331]  Mothers every week, every day are told, oh, your son died in a helicopter crash.
[00:49:09.672 --> 00:49:10.873]  Oh, your son died in training.
[00:49:13.255 --> 00:49:15.477]  There's a huge covert war going on down there.
[00:49:16.863 --> 00:49:18.564]  They've gone in and attacked Ecuador.
[00:49:18.824 --> 00:49:24.026]  They're trying to get Chavez to attack and start a war in Central and South America.
[00:49:26.147 --> 00:49:28.188]  In Northern South America is where it's going on right now.
[00:49:28.588 --> 00:49:29.828]  But they're planning to spread it.
[00:49:30.389 --> 00:49:31.009]  All the way up.
[00:49:32.209 --> 00:49:34.030]  This is what's happening right now.
[00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:35.751]  It's over cocaine.
[00:49:36.931 --> 00:49:38.972]  Over cocaine!
[00:49:41.973 --> 00:49:43.054]  And Venezuela's saying...
[00:49:43.903 --> 00:49:45.724]  You don't get 100% of the oil profits.
[00:49:45.744 --> 00:49:47.984]  You've got to leave 20-30% of it here for the government.
[00:49:50.565 --> 00:49:53.846]  And Exxon and the rest say, no, we don't give you anything to take oil out of your country.
[00:49:55.647 --> 00:50:03.830]  Just like in 1953, Mohammad Mosaddegh, pro-U.S., anti-communist, said, look, we're going to keep 25% of the oil money from Anglo-American oil.
[00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:05.230]  You can't just have a monopoly for free.
[00:50:05.590 --> 00:50:09.051]  And they said, you know what, we're going to come stage terror attacks and blame it on you and say you did it.
[00:50:09.271 --> 00:50:10.952]  And they did, and they threw him out, and now look what we have.
[00:50:11.644 --> 00:50:12.745]  And who'd they use to overthrow?
[00:50:13.005 --> 00:50:14.325]  Mohammad Mosaddegh, who was secular?
[00:50:14.886 --> 00:50:15.886]  They used Wahhabists.
[00:50:17.527 --> 00:50:20.869]  Led by the Saudis, and led by Norman Schwarzkopf's father.
[00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:24.210]  A famous CIA general.
[00:50:27.352 --> 00:50:29.173]  That's why they used Schwarzkopf in the next invasion.
[00:50:29.493 --> 00:50:31.254]  He went to school in Saudi Arabia.
[00:50:31.494 --> 00:50:33.195]  He was brought up in Saudi Arabia.
[00:50:33.635 --> 00:50:35.196]  He went to school with the princes.
[00:50:37.897 --> 00:50:38.898]  And the SWAT teams...
[00:50:39.864 --> 00:50:45.546]  Every day in this town where I live, busting innocent houses looking for drugs when the government openly deals it all.
[00:50:46.446 --> 00:50:46.706]  Look!
[00:50:46.926 --> 00:50:47.866]  Enough is enough!
[00:50:48.246 --> 00:50:49.187]  Enough of your frauds!
[00:50:49.507 --> 00:50:50.587]  Enough of your scams!
[00:50:51.867 --> 00:50:56.129]  We'll be right back with more of the geopolitical destabilization and the economic news.
[00:50:56.489 --> 00:50:57.049]  Stay with us!
[00:51:01.972 --> 00:51:03.673]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[00:51:03.974 --> 00:51:07.436]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:51:07.596 --> 00:51:09.498]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:51:09.518 --> 00:51:12.800]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:51:13.121 --> 00:51:18.625]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[00:51:18.905 --> 00:51:23.989]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat in the Info War.
[00:51:24.309 --> 00:51:28.111]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[00:52:08.018 --> 00:52:09.440]  We are entering martial law.
[00:52:09.941 --> 00:52:12.103]  There are ten telling signs of martial law.

[00:53:04.703 --> 00:53:06.144]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:53:06.244 --> 00:53:09.185]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:53:09.325 --> 00:53:12.166]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:53:12.186 --> 00:53:15.048]  It's not who votes that counts, it's who counts the votes.

[00:54:03.256 --> 00:54:05.397]  You win, don't lose, call me to a place you meet.

[00:54:35.229 --> 00:54:36.649]  It is Monday.
[00:54:38.590 --> 00:54:40.071]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:42.252 --> 00:54:46.214]  Hey, Willie Nelson's coming to the Star of Texas Rodeo in Austin, Texas tomorrow.
[00:54:48.215 --> 00:54:48.875]  I'm going to be there.
[00:54:48.895 --> 00:54:52.297]  Hope to see you out there.
[00:54:55.319 --> 00:54:55.719]  And, uh,
[00:54:57.708 --> 00:54:59.229]  Got a big guest coming up later in the week.
[00:54:59.269 --> 00:55:00.170]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:55:03.673 --> 00:55:04.834]  Okay.
[00:55:05.995 --> 00:55:09.017]  Chavez sends tanks into the Columbia border in dispute.
[00:55:09.057 --> 00:55:11.199]  Chavez warns of war with Columbia.
[00:55:14.001 --> 00:55:20.486]  He has said as part of his defense treaty that he may go ahead and use his air force to bomb them and attack their military.
[00:55:21.487 --> 00:55:25.310]  Now, of course, when this happens, they won't say on our news that...
[00:55:28.208 --> 00:55:28.828]  That the U.S.
[00:55:28.908 --> 00:55:37.394]  backed this or that Ecuador was bombed by Colombia.
[00:55:38.915 --> 00:55:39.655]  They won't do that.
[00:55:40.956 --> 00:55:45.059]  They will show Americans in Colombia.
[00:55:45.539 --> 00:55:46.300]  I know how they work.
[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:49.161]  If this escalates, you'll wonder why you keep seeing Americans on the news.
[00:55:49.742 --> 00:55:50.362]  And that's what they'll do.
[00:55:50.382 --> 00:55:51.183]  It's very scary.
[00:55:51.223 --> 00:55:53.684]  We work here and they're attacking and it's horrible.
[00:55:54.085 --> 00:55:55.385]  They're attacking Americans.
[00:55:55.465 --> 00:55:56.166]  Kill them!
[00:55:56.186 --> 00:55:57.767]  And of course it'll be CIA people.
[00:55:59.691 --> 00:56:08.918]  All part of manipulating you, all part of lying to you, when their ally has been massively military attacked because they wouldn't invest their cocaine money.
[00:56:10.319 --> 00:56:20.547]  And by the way, the globalists with our tax money, seven days a week, 365 days a year, fly into Ecuador airspace, fly over Colombia.
[00:56:20.987 --> 00:56:21.928]  They have GPS.
[00:56:21.948 --> 00:56:22.568]  This is admitted.
[00:56:22.888 --> 00:56:24.330]  This has been on our news.
[00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:28.813]  It's like, how dumb do they think we are?
[00:56:33.146 --> 00:56:37.828]  That, oh yeah, the stock exchange wants them to invest their cocaine money or will invade.
[00:56:38.109 --> 00:56:38.649]  Oh yeah.
[00:56:38.669 --> 00:56:44.372]  I mean, it's on the news where they have GPS of which cocaine fields to spray and which not to.
[00:56:45.172 --> 00:56:51.856]  Which ones are farmers in areas that are right up against fart-controlled areas.
[00:56:52.456 --> 00:56:54.917]  And so they fly in and spray their coca plants.
[00:56:55.557 --> 00:57:00.440]  But they'll be a half mile away from the coca plants that our government controls.
[00:57:01.834 --> 00:57:03.856]  It's the same thing in Afghanistan with the poppies.
[00:57:04.957 --> 00:57:06.078]  Poppies.
[00:57:06.278 --> 00:57:07.479]  Sleep, America.
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:09.461]  Enjoy your smack.
[00:57:10.182 --> 00:57:14.246]  If we catch your dopehead kid on it, we're going to give him ten years.
[00:57:16.187 --> 00:57:17.248]  Poppies.
[00:57:17.849 --> 00:57:21.933]  It's so hypocritical and disgusting.
[00:57:28.368 --> 00:57:29.750]  Just like we have private U.S.
[00:57:29.810 --> 00:57:34.495]  contractors flying around Columbia shooting U.S.
[00:57:34.836 --> 00:57:35.937]  missionaries out of the air.
[00:57:36.998 --> 00:57:44.547]  Just seven days a week, 365 days a year, just rogue squadrons flying around, killing whoever they want.
[00:57:44.968 --> 00:57:45.889]  It's so much fun.
[00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:47.030]  And the U.S.
[00:57:47.070 --> 00:57:48.432]  military is down there.
[00:57:49.620 --> 00:58:00.524]  In the capital, in Bogota, and surrounding other capitals, and they give the order on tape, shoot them down, and they go open fire, and they blow that little plane with that woman and her children and her husband to pieces.
[00:58:01.564 --> 00:58:04.365]  Because we kill anybody that comes into our cocaine area.
[00:58:05.925 --> 00:58:07.786]  Anybody that goes into the area we don't control.
[00:58:07.826 --> 00:58:08.726]  We're killing everybody.
[00:58:08.746 --> 00:58:10.787]  You might be trying to fly some of the goods out.
[00:58:10.827 --> 00:58:11.607]  This is a war!
[00:58:11.627 --> 00:58:14.908]  We've got to ship this in for idiot Americans to use it!
[00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:17.089]  So we can throw them in prison!
[00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:20.561]  In front of you, they deal the drugs!
[00:58:22.483 --> 00:58:25.005]  In the war on drugs now, you scurvy rats!
[00:58:27.407 --> 00:58:29.408]  All these innocent cops get killed, too.
[00:58:29.868 --> 00:58:33.211]  Raiding drug dealers for drugs the government ships in.
[00:58:34.652 --> 00:58:35.613]  You don't care about that.
[00:58:35.633 --> 00:58:40.676]  As long as it's for America!
[00:58:43.779 --> 00:58:45.260]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:46.252 --> 00:58:48.613]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:58.439 --> 00:58:59.139]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.739 --> 00:59:00.840]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:02.661]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:03.281 --> 00:59:04.082]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.842 --> 00:59:05.803]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.403 --> 00:59:10.325]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.605 --> 00:59:12.947]  And now, live from Austin, Texas...
[00:59:13.826 --> 00:59:14.687]  Alex Jones.
[00:59:20.170 --> 00:59:33.698]  In the next segment, I want to get your take on Turkish troops having to enter northern Iraq because of communist Kurds attacking them.
[00:59:35.419 --> 00:59:38.421]  On what you think about Al-Qaeda being hired by the U.S.
[00:59:38.441 --> 00:59:40.882]  to attack the Iranians now going into the fourth year.
[00:59:41.223 --> 00:59:41.563]  Admit it.
[00:59:43.457 --> 00:59:44.217]  On the U.S.
[00:59:44.377 --> 00:59:57.940]  backing the Wahhabist again, and having the coal off the shore, openly threatening Lebanon to install Wahhabist from Saudi Arabia.
[01:00:00.021 --> 01:00:02.161]  Boy, they have served the crown well for a hundred years.
[01:00:02.221 --> 01:00:03.262]  Man, they just run everything.
[01:00:03.302 --> 01:00:07.983]  It's like Wahhab... I'm not attacking Sunnis, by the way, but, I mean, let's just admit it.
[01:00:08.503 --> 01:00:12.744]  Your branch of Islam is what the New World Order is literally so in bed with
[01:00:13.855 --> 01:00:14.675]  They just run you.
[01:00:14.915 --> 01:00:19.696]  They basically created you, radicalized you, and you are quite a group.
[01:00:19.716 --> 01:00:20.396]  Let me just tell you that.
[01:00:21.456 --> 01:00:22.176]  Quite a group.
[01:00:23.137 --> 01:00:23.857]  Quite a group.
[01:00:24.357 --> 01:00:25.757]  All the countries you've destroyed.
[01:00:25.777 --> 01:00:27.717]  And it's so sick.
[01:00:27.757 --> 01:00:42.920]  You try to explain this to the average dumb, you know, know-it-all, Bush-loving redneck, or stupid know-it-all liberal, and they just cannot grasp history or subterfuge or Machiavellian systems when it's in textbooks.
[01:00:45.174 --> 01:00:47.855]  Al-Qaeda is the great sword of the New World Order.
[01:00:48.135 --> 01:00:53.696]  They run it, they control it, and it's social mind control.
[01:00:53.716 --> 01:01:00.258]  Instead of having to get somebody like the Bourne Identity, which, by the way, was in the news yesterday, mainstream news admits, yes, the U.S.
[01:01:00.298 --> 01:01:01.759]  government has mind control soldiers.
[01:01:01.779 --> 01:01:02.419]  That's now admitted.
[01:01:02.439 --> 01:01:03.599]  We're going to get to that later.
[01:01:04.939 --> 01:01:07.940]  Of course, that's been declassified for decades, but now more has come out.
[01:01:09.081 --> 01:01:14.322]  That's hard to do, though, because it just takes a lot of work, millions of dollars per person,
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:18.281]  You ruin a lot of people in the process, the reports are.
[01:01:18.661 --> 01:01:21.382]  It's not exact to get peak performance.
[01:01:21.982 --> 01:01:31.325]  No, you just take somebody raised in a Wahhabi-ist deal from the age of two, and they're socially and culturally mind-controlled, they will go blow themselves up, and they believe they're fighting for Allah.
[01:01:31.665 --> 01:01:33.906]  They don't know that their boss is CIA handler.
[01:01:34.326 --> 01:01:35.526]  It's so disgusting.
[01:01:38.147 --> 01:01:40.708]  It is so sophisticated, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:41.748 --> 01:01:43.509]  They have huge mind-control cores.
[01:01:44.292 --> 01:01:49.574]  Trained, brought up, bred, 5th, 6th, 7th generation by the globalists.
[01:01:49.614 --> 01:02:00.959]  The British were radicalizing Wahhabis in Saudi Arabia and exporting them to Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, as their force, as their shock troop.
[01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:13.064]  To come in and, yes, you will be, you know, your great Shia system will run, you know, will be run over by the beautiful
[01:02:15.149 --> 01:02:16.050]  Sunni system.
[01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:19.752]  And we will crush and downtrod your enemy, the Shiites.
[01:02:21.634 --> 01:02:22.474]  On and on and on.
[01:02:24.015 --> 01:02:26.997]  And that's how they control the Muslims, playing those two grips off against each other.
[01:02:29.299 --> 01:02:30.380]  And look, it's all real simple.
[01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:32.861]  The Iranians back the Shiites.
[01:02:32.901 --> 01:02:34.062]  They're a Shiite government.
[01:02:34.462 --> 01:02:42.428]  So when you hear on the news, Iran is backing Al-Qaeda, that's like saying Batman is backing the Joker.
[01:02:44.039 --> 01:02:46.000]  Or black is white and white is black.
[01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:47.361]  I don't know.
[01:02:47.381 --> 01:02:50.303]  That's like saying Lex Luthor is Superman.
[01:02:50.323 --> 01:02:51.184]  You can look at it either way.
[01:02:52.585 --> 01:02:59.449]  But again, Americans can't find Columbia, much less Bogota.
[01:02:59.529 --> 01:03:00.730]  They don't know the history down there.
[01:03:00.770 --> 01:03:01.991]  They don't know the history in the Middle East.
[01:03:02.711 --> 01:03:04.652]  All they know is it's somebody in a turban.
[01:03:05.873 --> 01:03:07.995]  I mean, they think India is Iran.
[01:03:08.295 --> 01:03:09.095]  They don't know.
[01:03:10.536 --> 01:03:11.677]  They don't know anything.
[01:03:13.294 --> 01:03:16.055]  They're lambs to a slaughter.
[01:03:19.556 --> 01:03:23.057]  Absolute braying, begging lambs.
[01:03:24.977 --> 01:03:25.618]  Bedwetting.
[01:03:25.638 --> 01:03:29.219]  We are a nation of bedwetting, chicken-necked cowards.
[01:03:30.499 --> 01:03:36.241]  Or, we're a nation of fired-up, tough, good ol' boys who are being conned and sent off in the wrong direction.
[01:03:36.761 --> 01:03:36.961]  Me!
[01:03:38.191 --> 01:03:40.735]  It's like an old Transformers cartoon in the 80s.
[01:03:40.895 --> 01:03:42.077]  Me Grimlock!
[01:03:42.197 --> 01:03:44.160]  Me work with my new friend!
[01:03:45.042 --> 01:03:45.903]  Megatron!
[01:03:46.264 --> 01:03:48.848]  Me destroy the bad Optimus Prime!
[01:03:49.469 --> 01:03:50.651]  Me Grimlock!
[01:03:51.412 --> 01:03:51.973]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:54.156 --> 01:04:02.098]  For years, you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained the leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[01:04:02.558 --> 01:04:05.698]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?

[01:05:03.973 --> 01:05:05.374]  America, Freedom to Fascism.

[01:05:53.945 --> 01:05:55.105]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, M.D.
[01:05:55.225 --> 01:05:57.486]  of the New Traumatical Report here on Genesis.
[01:05:57.646 --> 01:06:01.327]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S., is a real thing.
[01:06:01.447 --> 01:06:08.328]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer for a fresh, never-before-available garlic.
[01:06:08.448 --> 01:06:19.311]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites, TB, and it kills flesh-eating bacteria, MRSA, and acinetobacter infections that ravage our everyday health.
[01:06:19.431 --> 01:06:20.071]  Take it daily.

[01:06:40.706 --> 01:06:43.989]  That number again, 888-212-8871, the most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[01:06:58.630 --> 01:06:59.290]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.951 --> 01:07:01.031]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:01.711 --> 01:07:02.812]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:03.472 --> 01:07:04.292]  You want answers?
[01:07:05.053 --> 01:07:05.993]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:06.013 --> 01:07:10.575]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.795 --> 01:07:14.916]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:14.936 --> 01:07:26.441]  1-800-259-9231 Our criminal government publicly ships the narcotics in, controls the laundering of it,
[01:07:27.894 --> 01:07:30.055]  Using different drug cartels and distributors.
[01:07:30.075 --> 01:07:36.880]  And if they don't pay their cuts, special ops from the U.S., backed by the client country, go in and kill everybody.
[01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:39.281]  And if it's a village, they walk up and kill every child.
[01:07:40.862 --> 01:07:42.683]  That's mainstream information.
[01:07:43.124 --> 01:07:45.285]  They just come in, seek and destroy, kill everybody.
[01:07:46.065 --> 01:07:49.528]  And the troops literally are told, this is a drug facility.
[01:07:50.208 --> 01:07:52.349]  They're laundering money for terrorists.
[01:07:52.770 --> 01:07:54.871]  But the troops always wake up within a few years...
[01:07:55.652 --> 01:08:03.796]  And then they get out, or some of them are psychopathic and like the cocaine, like the Bogota whores, like the power, and they move up the chain.
[01:08:04.416 --> 01:08:06.257]  They become black-op commanders.
[01:08:08.078 --> 01:08:09.599]  And now they're looking at the U.S.
[01:08:09.879 --> 01:08:11.660]  Oh, having their way with the U.S.
[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:14.341]  Let me just tell you a brief story, then I'm going to get into the economy.
[01:08:17.903 --> 01:08:23.446]  You see the movie The Godfather 1, where they're all sitting around the commission table, the 15 families from the U.S.? ?
[01:08:24.344 --> 01:08:27.565]  And, of course, that's from real congressional hearings and things that came out.
[01:08:27.585 --> 01:08:28.706]  That's exactly how they met.
[01:08:28.806 --> 01:08:30.086]  You ask how organized crime works.
[01:08:30.106 --> 01:08:30.826]  How does our government work?
[01:08:30.927 --> 01:08:31.607]  It works like that.
[01:08:33.648 --> 01:08:36.909]  And they've just had a mob war, which our own criminal system has from time to time.
[01:08:38.389 --> 01:08:44.612]  And Don Corleone, which is based on a real person, and, of course, the character they have in there is the singer who's with the family.
[01:08:44.632 --> 01:08:46.092]  He's also supposed to be Frank Sinatra.
[01:08:48.073 --> 01:08:50.894]  Based on the big New York crime family of a different name than Corleone.
[01:08:52.375 --> 01:08:53.435]  And he wouldn't deal drugs.
[01:08:54.776 --> 01:08:56.157]  Even though he'd gotten up into the 40s.
[01:08:57.858 --> 01:08:58.958]  And he owned all the judges.
[01:08:59.338 --> 01:09:02.320]  And they basically say, look, sell it to the blacks.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.401]  They don't have souls anyways.
[01:09:06.622 --> 01:09:11.945]  And then they also use that as a way to corrupt the police, buy more of them, get the cops involved in narcotics.
[01:09:14.474 --> 01:09:17.475]  But you've got to look at who was shipping the opium in and the cocaine in.
[01:09:17.495 --> 01:09:20.956]  And it was the British East India Company, based out of Skull and Bones.
[01:09:20.996 --> 01:09:22.597]  That's mainstream History Channel news.
[01:09:23.517 --> 01:09:24.397]  That's not even debated.
[01:09:24.417 --> 01:09:28.059]  You understand that the Bushes and the rest of them are opium dynasties.
[01:09:28.079 --> 01:09:29.339]  The Roosevelts, all of them.
[01:09:30.159 --> 01:09:33.421]  So they sell it to the Italians as, quote, the bad guys.
[01:09:33.781 --> 01:09:34.841]  You be the bad guys.
[01:09:36.502 --> 01:09:39.803]  And then they distribute so the big banks don't get their hands dirty.
[01:09:41.543 --> 01:09:43.324]  Now, by the 1950s, that was all over.
[01:09:43.934 --> 01:09:49.977]  The wasp out of Yale, out of Skull and Bones, the entire leadership's Skull and Bones, still today.
[01:09:50.998 --> 01:09:53.719]  They just come in and start running their own ops.
[01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:57.421]  The Italian mafia gets a little bit big for its witches.
[01:09:59.382 --> 01:10:02.183]  And so they start announcing, oh, a mob exists.
[01:10:02.243 --> 01:10:04.905]  And Hoover on their payroll says it's a conspiracy theory.
[01:10:05.205 --> 01:10:06.886]  There's no such thing as La Cosa Nosa.
[01:10:06.926 --> 01:10:07.386]  Remember that?
[01:10:07.726 --> 01:10:09.647]  Famous film footage of him in front of the Congress?
[01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:15.391]  So that was kind of an internal war right there.
[01:10:17.671 --> 01:10:24.093]  The WASP and Jewish mob, which have basically been together in England for 500 years, that's the big mafia.
[01:10:24.814 --> 01:10:25.814]  And they're all intermarried.
[01:10:25.854 --> 01:10:26.714]  It's indistinguishable.
[01:10:28.315 --> 01:10:29.235]  That's what runs things.
[01:10:29.255 --> 01:10:32.176]  The Italians literally are nothing compared to it.
[01:10:35.937 --> 01:10:40.559]  And then they've got their sub-mobs and their sub-city chiefs, the South's the Dixie Mafia,
[01:10:41.471 --> 01:10:43.633]  They got the West Coast WASP mob.
[01:10:47.756 --> 01:10:49.037]  And they got the spy satellites.
[01:10:49.057 --> 01:10:50.599]  They want to stop a drug shipment coming in?
[01:10:50.939 --> 01:10:51.700]  I've talked to many of these.
[01:10:51.740 --> 01:10:52.260]  Come out in the news.
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:54.282]  I've talked to folks who were there spotting shit.
[01:10:54.802 --> 01:10:56.544]  And a guy stands behind them going, let that plane in.
[01:10:57.004 --> 01:10:57.805]  Don't let that one in.
[01:10:58.906 --> 01:10:59.546]  Stop that one.
[01:10:59.787 --> 01:11:00.567]  Shoot that one down.
[01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:05.171]  Oh, that one hadn't paid his cut.
[01:11:05.251 --> 01:11:07.733]  They monitor it when it takes off from an airfield.
[01:11:08.274 --> 01:11:09.775]  They know where it's going, what it's doing.
[01:11:14.161 --> 01:11:23.289]  There's the occasional embarrassment, like two months ago, where a CIA aircraft that had been flying torture flights was doing another run with 3.3 tons of pure cocaine.
[01:11:23.729 --> 01:11:24.389]  Hadn't been cut.
[01:11:24.510 --> 01:11:25.090]  Pure cocaine.
[01:11:25.390 --> 01:11:26.371]  Pure cocaine.
[01:11:27.052 --> 01:11:31.455]  Being flown out of Columbia, crashed in the Yucatan Peninsula in southwestern Mexico.
[01:11:32.736 --> 01:11:37.260]  Because there was a bad storm, bad headwinds, they couldn't get to the field they thought they could.
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:38.982]  We're looking for another airfield.
[01:11:39.082 --> 01:11:39.462]  Crashed.
[01:11:41.010 --> 01:11:42.011]  But it's never in the U.S.
[01:11:42.071 --> 01:11:42.311]  news.
[01:11:42.651 --> 01:11:46.793]  CIA aircraft, 3.3 tons of pure cocaine.
[01:11:51.555 --> 01:11:52.996]  So let me explain how this started.
[01:11:53.036 --> 01:11:59.339]  They didn't just go to the local crime bosses and say, we're going to sell cocaine and heroin to your 10-year-old daughter.
[01:12:00.419 --> 01:12:03.681]  No, they said, the blacks are getting out of control.
[01:12:03.701 --> 01:12:06.222]  Now, this has come out in major historical documents.
[01:12:06.242 --> 01:12:07.403]  That's why they put it in the Godfather.
[01:12:07.423 --> 01:12:07.983]  That's based...
[01:12:09.858 --> 01:12:11.619]  Again, on real happenings, they've put it in fiction.
[01:12:11.639 --> 01:12:12.520]  That's why it's so good.
[01:12:13.581 --> 01:12:22.007]  And we're going to, but don't we're going to sell to the blacks, and then we can use that to put them in prison, and then we'll even have prison industries and make them work as slaves as they should.
[01:12:23.328 --> 01:12:26.030]  And see, a lot of whites said, yeah, go ahead and put those blacks in there.
[01:12:26.270 --> 01:12:27.071]  Now it's everybody.
[01:12:27.091 --> 01:12:27.932]  You see how that works?
[01:12:29.913 --> 01:12:30.714]  Real funny, isn't it?
[01:12:32.955 --> 01:12:36.498]  And they can also show drug dealers and guns and shooting and the scum of them.
[01:12:37.142 --> 01:12:38.903]  And then that makes the drug war look okay.
[01:12:38.943 --> 01:12:41.624]  Well, of course, that scum gravitates towards something that's illegal.
[01:12:42.244 --> 01:12:44.925]  And that scum will be doing something else after you legalize drugs.
[01:12:45.625 --> 01:12:47.466]  It's disgusting.
[01:12:48.466 --> 01:12:49.507]  It corrupts our police.
[01:12:49.547 --> 01:12:50.787]  It corrupts our society.
[01:12:51.187 --> 01:12:52.248]  We have to stop it.
[01:12:52.268 --> 01:13:01.331]  All right, I've spent way too much time on this so far today, but it's a big deal, and I want to take your calls on it at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:13:05.336 --> 01:13:08.318]  On the economy, we're becoming shell-shocked here.
[01:13:08.838 --> 01:13:10.519]  We're becoming kind of passe.
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:19.324]  We're becoming kind of outrage, dull.
[01:13:21.945 --> 01:13:24.967]  Because it's just, yeah, the dollar, another day, the dollar plunges more.
[01:13:25.407 --> 01:13:26.948]  Another day, gold goes up.
[01:13:27.128 --> 01:13:28.829]  Gold is at $9.90 and 40 cents right now.
[01:13:28.849 --> 01:13:29.249]  $990 and 40 cents.
[01:13:34.412 --> 01:13:35.513]  It goes up every day.
[01:13:39.534 --> 01:13:41.275]  It is the best investment out there.
[01:13:43.056 --> 01:13:43.896]  But are people listening?
[01:13:43.936 --> 01:13:44.316]  I don't know.
[01:13:44.796 --> 01:13:47.358]  Oil jumps to record on dollars fall.
[01:13:47.398 --> 01:13:48.118]  This is today.
[01:13:49.418 --> 01:13:54.160]  Oil jumps to new record above $103 a barrel as the dollar declines to a new low against the euro.
[01:13:57.042 --> 01:13:57.742]  Unbelievable.
[01:13:57.782 --> 01:13:58.722]  I'm looking at these numbers.
[01:13:58.762 --> 01:13:59.823]  This is just curtains.
[01:14:01.034 --> 01:14:02.575]  Absolute curtains.
[01:14:02.975 --> 01:14:05.717]  Meanwhile, everybody's freaking out that Boeing didn't get the U.S.
[01:14:05.797 --> 01:14:07.557]  Air Force contract for refuelers.
[01:14:07.577 --> 01:14:10.659]  Of course they didn't.
[01:14:11.099 --> 01:14:14.481]  But it doesn't matter if the French got the contract Airbus.
[01:14:15.261 --> 01:14:16.542]  Boeing's in China!
[01:14:17.983 --> 01:14:18.943]  It's all gone.
[01:14:19.804 --> 01:14:21.364]  You think this government's patriotic?
[01:14:21.625 --> 01:14:24.826]  They're stripping every last piece of meat off our bones right now.
[01:14:25.246 --> 01:14:27.988]  And you're kissing the buzzard thinking it's your mommy.
[01:14:28.681 --> 01:14:31.843]  You dumb neocon followers are trying to suckle a buzzard.
[01:14:32.264 --> 01:14:33.645]  That ain't your mama.
[01:14:34.085 --> 01:14:37.648]  That's a carrion bird eating your guts, you idiot.
[01:14:40.530 --> 01:14:44.472]  You literally are looking for suckle off a buzzard.
[01:14:44.793 --> 01:14:46.894]  You need to be slapped upside the head.
[01:14:48.535 --> 01:14:51.217]  These are hardcore, cold-blooded predator class.
[01:14:52.838 --> 01:14:53.559]  They rule.
[01:14:53.579 --> 01:14:57.542]  And as soon as you figure that out, you idiots, the sooner we can beat them!
[01:14:59.828 --> 01:15:01.089]  I'm sick of it.
[01:15:01.149 --> 01:15:03.731]  Everything's just... The country's gone, man.
[01:15:03.751 --> 01:15:08.194]  If this continues another few months, the dollar ain't coming back, you fools.
[01:15:08.714 --> 01:15:10.015]  I'm talking to people that laugh at me.
[01:15:11.056 --> 01:15:11.876]  This isn't funny.
[01:15:12.096 --> 01:15:13.357]  I actually am patriotic.
[01:15:13.777 --> 01:15:15.559]  I know this country's important and special.
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:18.761]  I admire this nation.
[01:15:19.061 --> 01:15:20.982]  I'm proud of what this country's done in the past.
[01:15:21.242 --> 01:15:22.183]  We haven't been perfect.
[01:15:22.303 --> 01:15:23.164]  We've been the best there is.
[01:15:23.184 --> 01:15:26.366]  And it's all getting flushed down the toilet by people like you!
[01:15:27.987 --> 01:15:29.527]  I expect the evil to be evil.
[01:15:31.408 --> 01:15:35.749]  But I don't expect you to be a bunch of fools that follow it energetically.
[01:15:36.689 --> 01:15:40.991]  When they run the Muslim extremists, they run the communists, and if they don't run them, they kill them.
[01:15:42.191 --> 01:15:43.431]  And they run you in the ground.
[01:15:44.011 --> 01:15:49.433]  And I'm going to tell you again, cops, they're shooting you up full of mercury, they're putting sodium chloride in your water too, Jack.
[01:15:52.254 --> 01:15:53.054]  They've hurt you.
[01:15:53.094 --> 01:15:57.135]  They physically assault you every day, and you still serve this system.
[01:15:57.890 --> 01:16:00.052]  We've got to turn this around right now!
[01:16:00.452 --> 01:16:02.454]  Now, in your gut, you know I'm telling you the truth.
[01:16:02.474 --> 01:16:03.495]  You've got instincts left.
[01:16:03.955 --> 01:16:05.076]  They hadn't fully destroyed them.
[01:16:05.457 --> 01:16:08.359]  Now, you follow those instincts and you go look into what I've said.
[01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:11.001]  And then you find out I'm telling you the truth.
[01:16:11.822 --> 01:16:13.263]  We've got to turn this around.
[01:16:13.483 --> 01:16:15.445]  This leads into something you don't want to be part of.
[01:16:17.627 --> 01:16:25.153]  They tell you all that camaraderie and they condition you to serve in your system and they make you think that you're all safe and it's all about your safety.
[01:16:25.274 --> 01:16:25.434]  Bull!
[01:16:25.454 --> 01:16:25.614]  Bull!
[01:16:26.343 --> 01:16:26.743]  And gold is now at $9.99.
[01:16:55.982 --> 01:16:58.524]  Ted priced this deal you're getting at $9.40.
[01:16:58.924 --> 01:17:01.245]  The deal before that was $9.20 when it was $9.50.
[01:17:02.086 --> 01:17:03.387]  He's going to have to change it again.
[01:17:03.707 --> 01:17:05.288]  It's going to have to go up again soon.
[01:17:05.508 --> 01:17:06.989]  This deal isn't lasting long.
[01:17:08.049 --> 01:17:13.413]  Ted, you've got gold that you priced out at $9.50 an ounce when you set prices, and it's now $9.90.
[01:17:13.953 --> 01:17:16.234]  If people have got money, I don't know what their problem is.
[01:17:16.254 --> 01:17:17.235]  They need to move into gold.
[01:17:18.058 --> 01:17:20.720]  You know, Alex, I really do have to be getting into gold right now.
[01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:28.446]  Gold is just approaching the $1,000 price range and that's such a significant psychological level once we get through that.
[01:17:29.096 --> 01:17:32.179]  You know, we're looking at $1,200, $1,300 gold.
[01:17:32.219 --> 01:17:35.601]  I mean, platinum just blasted through $2,000 an ounce.
[01:17:35.962 --> 01:17:38.864]  It was $1,200 an ounce here just six months ago.
[01:17:39.364 --> 01:17:42.207]  Silver right now is over $20 an ounce now.
[01:17:42.247 --> 01:17:43.708]  We've talked about that, Alex.
[01:17:44.208 --> 01:17:46.750]  Silver has just shot up over $20 an ounce.
[01:17:47.191 --> 01:17:53.756]  And again, another just, you know, it tells us that the United States dollar is doomed.
[01:17:54.744 --> 01:17:57.911]  Grain prices, you know, wheat has doubled in price.
[01:17:58.111 --> 01:17:59.655]  Everything's going up like crazy.
[01:18:00.397 --> 01:18:02.301]  Wheat doubled last week, then it tripled.
[01:18:03.141 --> 01:18:04.703]  So, I mean, there you have it right there.
[01:18:04.723 --> 01:18:09.668]  I mean, we can't even buy the food anymore that we used to buy at the prices that we used to get.
[01:18:09.748 --> 01:18:11.870]  Right now is the time to be getting involved.
[01:18:12.471 --> 01:18:14.834]  Silver right now is just a fantastic buy.
[01:18:14.874 --> 01:18:17.576]  We've got the silver dollars.
[01:18:17.917 --> 01:18:22.722]  When I talk about silver, I'm talking about four dimes or ten dimes or four quarters.
[01:18:22.842 --> 01:18:24.444]  One dollar's face value right now.
[01:18:25.284 --> 01:18:27.105]  21.50.
[01:18:25.784 --> 01:18:27.105]  Gold is going like crazy.
[01:18:28.345 --> 01:18:32.686]  At the other side of the break, we better talk a little bit more about what's available because there's not a whole lot.
[01:18:32.886 --> 01:18:33.806]  Yeah, there's not a lot.
[01:18:34.186 --> 01:18:36.807]  Again, these prices are going to be ending soon, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:36.887 --> 01:18:38.748]  Every time we tell you this happens, it happens.
[01:18:39.748 --> 01:18:40.688]  So listen to us.
[01:18:41.488 --> 01:18:42.388]  Listen carefully.
[01:18:43.269 --> 01:18:44.769]  When these deals are gone, they're gone.
[01:18:44.849 --> 01:18:49.290]  Gold is going straight up like a Titan rocket.
[01:18:49.610 --> 01:18:50.310]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:50.330 --> 01:18:51.531]  We're going to take your calls as well.
[01:18:51.551 --> 01:18:52.291]  A ton of other news.
[01:18:54.528 --> 01:18:55.930]  It is a big idea.
[01:18:55.950 --> 01:18:58.052]  A new world order.
[01:18:58.773 --> 01:19:02.798]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:19:02.818 --> 01:19:05.802]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:19:06.483 --> 01:19:08.745]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[01:19:09.286 --> 01:19:11.669]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:19:12.444 --> 01:19:19.912]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:19:22.795 --> 01:19:27.761]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:19:28.241 --> 01:19:31.724]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:19:32.125 --> 01:19:34.187]  Bill Vargas makes great progress for the world.
[01:19:34.667 --> 01:19:35.828]  Most people have no idea.
[01:19:35.848 --> 01:19:36.609]  They're not after money.
[01:19:36.629 --> 01:19:37.690]  They have all the money they need.
[01:19:37.870 --> 01:19:38.631]  They're after power.
[01:19:38.891 --> 01:19:39.572]  That's what happens.
[01:19:40.052 --> 01:19:48.240]  Order Endgame on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:49.201]  Endgame.
[01:19:49.501 --> 01:19:51.242]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:19:51.563 --> 01:19:52.704]  You have been warned.
[01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:55.450]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[01:19:55.650 --> 01:19:58.691]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[01:19:58.931 --> 01:20:03.552]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:20:03.912 --> 01:20:06.533]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[01:20:06.793 --> 01:20:11.674]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing that the major oil companies have run.
[01:20:11.874 --> 01:20:13.654]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[01:20:13.854 --> 01:20:19.576]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[01:20:19.836 --> 01:20:21.536]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[01:20:22.016 --> 01:20:25.839]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[01:20:26.279 --> 01:20:37.285]  SFR recently ran this ad, and the response from all over the United States was so strong that they are allowing my listeners to buy one at their regular price of $9.95 and get another one free of charge.
[01:20:37.686 --> 01:20:42.749]  If you are not completely delighted with the savings, SFR will refund the purchase price and shipping.
[01:20:42.969 --> 01:20:46.010]  Share in the oil company's secret and get SFR now.
[01:20:46.251 --> 01:20:46.651]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[01:20:48.892 --> 01:20:52.035]  That's 888-USE-SFR1 today.
[01:20:53.356 --> 01:21:06.107]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in Internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:21:06.507 --> 01:21:13.273]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[01:21:13.573 --> 01:21:14.013]  We're good to go.
[01:21:44.494 --> 01:21:46.757]  We're in a no-hold-far information war.
[01:21:47.118 --> 01:21:52.445]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:54.882]  America needs Ron Paul.
[01:21:55.022 --> 01:21:58.445]  There are numerous ways to show your support for him and a better America.
[01:21:58.625 --> 01:22:02.529]  We know that many people would like to show their support but want to do it on a larger scale.
[01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:05.631]  That's why we have created RonPaulFlags.com.
[01:22:05.791 --> 01:22:13.759]  RonPaulFlags.com produces some of the most beautiful flags dedicated to electing the only man fit to be president of our ailing country.
[01:22:13.979 --> 01:22:18.963]  Standard flags are 3 feet by 5 feet and custom flags can be as large as 30 feet by 50 feet.
[01:22:19.704 --> 01:22:23.226]  And if you purchase two or more, you will receive a 16% discount.
[01:22:38.195 --> 01:22:40.638]  Go to RonPaulFlags.com or call 731-664-1526.
[01:22:40.699 --> 01:22:40.999]  That's 731-664-1526.
[01:22:41.019 --> 01:22:44.523]  Stand up for what you believe and stand out from the crowd.
[01:22:44.543 --> 01:22:45.705]  Go to RonPaulFlags.com today.
[01:23:05.501 --> 01:23:08.342]  We were telling you to buy gold, but it was $264 an ounce.
[01:23:09.543 --> 01:23:13.324]  We told you to buy when it was $550.
[01:23:14.365 --> 01:23:13.324]  $600.
[01:23:14.385 --> 01:23:13.324]  $700.
[01:23:14.405 --> 01:23:13.324]  $850.
[01:23:14.425 --> 01:23:17.746]  $900.
[01:23:14.445 --> 01:23:17.746]  $950.
[01:23:16.346 --> 01:23:17.746]  Now $990.
[01:23:17.906 --> 01:23:22.968]  And Ted's got it at very low prices.
[01:23:23.008 --> 01:23:26.090]  You'd be hard-stretched to find a deal like this.
[01:23:26.110 --> 01:23:27.150]  They have it in stock.
[01:23:27.510 --> 01:23:30.812]  They're waiting to take your call right now on these introductory offers.
[01:23:31.612 --> 01:23:33.893]  The British Sovereign is an amazing deal.
[01:23:34.682 --> 01:23:35.802]  Quarter ounce of gold.
[01:23:35.862 --> 01:23:37.363]  The francs are an excellent deal.
[01:23:38.023 --> 01:23:39.103]  Fifth of an ounce of gold.
[01:23:39.483 --> 01:23:47.026]  Plus, those always have higher value per amount of gold per ounce because they are smaller.
[01:23:47.046 --> 01:23:50.366]  For some reason, a big coin is generally less than a bunch of small coins.
[01:23:51.527 --> 01:23:52.907]  And the silver is a great deal.
[01:23:52.987 --> 01:23:53.807]  I've got small silver.
[01:23:53.847 --> 01:23:54.648]  I've got big silver.
[01:23:54.668 --> 01:23:55.728]  That's what I've been getting into.
[01:23:55.768 --> 01:23:57.068]  That's moved a lot.
[01:23:58.049 --> 01:23:59.909]  But you can't beat it.
[01:24:00.389 --> 01:24:02.510]  Ted, tell them about the offers you've got and how long...
[01:24:04.108 --> 01:24:07.432]  How long until this supply runs out and you've got to go up to the $9.90 level?
[01:24:07.992 --> 01:24:14.599]  Well, I mean, obviously the demand is very high right now and there's not a whole lot of supply left out there, period.
[01:24:14.659 --> 01:24:20.025]  I mean, I was offering silver dollars here not too long ago and silver dollars became unavailable.
[01:24:20.772 --> 01:24:23.054]  Right now we're offering silver dimes and quarters.
[01:24:23.514 --> 01:24:24.915]  They'll become unavailable.
[01:24:25.035 --> 01:24:26.736]  Right now they're at $21.50.
[01:24:27.197 --> 01:24:31.440]  Silver right now is at $20.66 an ounce.
[01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:33.141]  That isn't going to hold.
[01:24:33.241 --> 01:24:34.742]  I mean, it's not very long at all.
[01:24:34.782 --> 01:24:35.863]  I can tell you that much, Alex.
[01:24:36.563 --> 01:24:37.304]  We're good to go.
[01:24:57.217 --> 01:24:59.958]  You know, the supplies are real tight.
[01:24:59.978 --> 01:25:01.619]  And I am very, very upset about this.
[01:25:01.639 --> 01:25:03.099]  You'd think that me and Tim would be happy.
[01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:04.660]  We talk to each other at night.
[01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:05.780]  We are very upset.
[01:25:06.261 --> 01:25:14.664]  This is our dear, beloved country going under like a huge, beautiful ship, just with third-world people literally crawling all over it, giggling and laughing as it burns.
[01:25:14.684 --> 01:25:17.265]  They have no idea they're going down into the ice, too.
[01:25:18.346 --> 01:25:25.553]  All of this, the globalists are destroying us by design, as the IMF documents and World Bank documents say, to be able to consolidate everything.
[01:25:25.974 --> 01:25:34.482]  This is the raping of the nation, and the propaganda I'm hearing about Mary Madeline and others, oh, the liberals are saying it's bad because they want to blame Republicans.
[01:25:34.682 --> 01:25:35.924]  The economy's wonderful.
[01:25:36.244 --> 01:25:36.604]  Bull!
[01:25:36.925 --> 01:25:38.707]  Both parties are owned by the same people.
[01:25:39.367 --> 01:25:40.809]  They're all trying to spin this.
[01:25:41.494 --> 01:25:44.797]  And you cannot overstate how serious the economy is.
[01:25:44.837 --> 01:25:48.320]  With all this leveraged debt, the dollar plunging, that's all we have left.
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:49.140]  Get into gold.
[01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:50.561]  Tell them about the offer, Ted.
[01:25:50.601 --> 01:25:55.966]  Yeah, right now we have British sovereigns there at $250, and we have the franc coins at $215.
[01:25:56.386 --> 01:26:01.470]  We have the dollars per dollar face silver right now at $2150.
[01:26:02.391 --> 01:26:06.394]  And like I said, Alex, right now at this particular time, the market is hot.
[01:26:06.434 --> 01:26:07.555]  You've got to get into it now.
[01:26:08.306 --> 01:26:15.511]  If you're sitting in the bank, if you have stocks, if you have bonds, if you have any of these other paper-type investments, you're going to just watch it melt away.
[01:26:16.152 --> 01:26:17.833]  Like you said, ice cube in the desert.
[01:26:18.173 --> 01:26:21.295]  And see, Ted, I'm not a big spender with a little bit of savings.
[01:26:21.335 --> 01:26:24.077]  I don't go to the mall to buy things unless I really need it.
[01:26:24.097 --> 01:26:25.398]  I don't like shopping.
[01:26:26.079 --> 01:26:27.920]  And so people who have a little bit of money in the bank
[01:26:29.005 --> 01:26:29.807]  We're good to go.
[01:26:41.684 --> 01:26:43.886]  I've got a little bit of money left for my children's savings.
[01:26:43.946 --> 01:26:49.910]  I've got to go pull that out, basically close bank accounts now to get more silver and gold and put them in safety deposit boxes.
[01:26:50.330 --> 01:26:51.671]  I mean, it's over, folks.
[01:26:51.971 --> 01:26:52.391]  It's over.
[01:26:52.952 --> 01:26:55.453]  I mean, I'm even having to just get completely out of cash.
[01:26:55.633 --> 01:26:56.054]  It's over.
[01:26:56.654 --> 01:26:56.994]  Okay?
[01:26:57.174 --> 01:26:57.695]  I'm mad.
[01:26:57.935 --> 01:26:59.056]  I'm not happy about this.
[01:26:59.336 --> 01:27:02.938]  You better move into gold and silver right now so you at least have a life raft.
[01:27:03.158 --> 01:27:03.959]  Ted, give them the number.
[01:27:04.159 --> 01:27:04.579]  Yeah, it's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:27:04.599 --> 01:27:04.980]  Again, it's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:27:10.263 --> 01:27:10.864]  We're good to go.
[01:27:35.603 --> 01:27:45.565]  You know, every time we do this, Alex, just a week later, everybody's up so much in price that they can take a real nice profit and come out with extra money if they want to get back to paper.
[01:27:45.926 --> 01:27:47.886]  I'm not suggesting that because it's stupid.
[01:27:48.206 --> 01:27:53.367]  Right now, paper buys gold and you will not always have that opportunity.
[01:27:53.687 --> 01:27:59.169]  Gold will always be able to be traded back to paper, but paper will not always be able to be traded into gold.
[01:28:00.129 --> 01:28:00.189]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:28:02.190 --> 01:28:04.811]  Ted's got great deals for you.
[01:28:04.851 --> 01:28:05.811]  He ships it quick.
[01:28:07.091 --> 01:28:11.013]  But even if you don't get it there, get it somewhere, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:11.033 --> 01:28:12.913]  800-686-2237.
[01:28:14.214 --> 01:28:19.716]  Convert some of those Federal Reserve notes before their value is completely destroyed.
[01:28:19.916 --> 01:28:23.957]  The globalist, the CFR, said a month ago, Ted, you ought to offer that report free.
[01:28:24.237 --> 01:28:25.798]  That big CFR report they put out.
[01:28:26.178 --> 01:28:30.700]  So people can read it where they said they're going to kill the dollar by design and call for a global currency.
[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:35.583]  1-800-686-2237 We'll be back with your calls and a ton of news.
[01:28:35.823 --> 01:28:36.543]  Keep it locked in.
[01:28:44.247 --> 01:28:45.208]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.648 --> 01:28:47.269]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.189 --> 01:28:50.891]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.382 --> 01:29:04.110]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:29:04.311 --> 01:29:09.095]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:29:09.375 --> 01:29:20.486]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:29:20.786 --> 01:29:26.330]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:29:26.550 --> 01:29:32.614]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:29:32.835 --> 01:29:33.475]  What about you?
[01:29:33.755 --> 01:29:35.656]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.
[01:29:35.676 --> 01:29:39.799]  $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.
[01:29:39.979 --> 01:29:41.661]  Call Jeff and order now by calling 562-544-0507.

[01:29:49.426 --> 01:29:49.946]  We're good to go.

[01:30:54.541 --> 01:30:56.383]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:30:56.523 --> 01:31:03.230]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:31:03.490 --> 01:31:11.678]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:31:11.898 --> 01:31:17.363]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:31:17.383 --> 01:31:18.043]  We're good to go.
[01:31:36.155 --> 01:31:36.836]  We're good to go.
[01:32:05.138 --> 01:32:05.538]  That's right.
[01:32:05.558 --> 01:32:07.259]  They used to grow the food in Kansas.
[01:32:07.279 --> 01:32:09.320]  They want to grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
[01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:13.062]  I can see the day coming when your home garden will be against the law.
[01:32:13.102 --> 01:32:17.805]  By the way, they're now passing laws like that around the country.
[01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:32.821]  Total control.
[01:32:33.121 --> 01:32:40.885]  The law-abiding, fed on by a disgusting, militarized criminal class filled with arrogance and aplomb.
[01:32:42.366 --> 01:32:45.488]  Tasering and batoning you into submission.
[01:32:45.508 --> 01:32:50.411]  You better get that through your head!
[01:32:50.431 --> 01:32:52.352]  Ha-ha!
[01:32:54.253 --> 01:32:55.293]  My violence...
[01:33:00.098 --> 01:33:01.058]  Oh, yeah.
[01:33:04.579 --> 01:33:10.001]  Let's be a bunch of chumps who just believe all the baloney we're told.
[01:33:10.061 --> 01:33:11.101]  We're the good guys.
[01:33:11.641 --> 01:33:13.122]  We do the good job.
[01:33:13.142 --> 01:33:16.063]  The government loves you.
[01:33:16.083 --> 01:33:20.244]  Okay, I know we have loaded phone lines.
[01:33:20.324 --> 01:33:23.044]  Joe, Kevin, Michael, Alex, Christian, and many others.
[01:33:23.325 --> 01:33:23.925]  And you know what?
[01:33:23.945 --> 01:33:25.305]  I'm not going to tell you the news that's coming up.
[01:33:25.325 --> 01:33:26.005]  There's a lot of it.
[01:33:26.425 --> 01:33:28.446]  It's important, but I just want to get directly to your calls.
[01:33:29.318 --> 01:33:31.440]  And then I will get to all this other news.
[01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:34.602]  Joe in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[01:33:34.662 --> 01:33:35.082]  Go ahead.
[01:33:35.563 --> 01:33:36.743]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[01:33:37.484 --> 01:33:38.885]  I just wanted to make a comment.
[01:33:39.605 --> 01:33:43.808]  I watched your video, 9-11 Road to Tyranny, with my dad.
[01:33:44.329 --> 01:33:49.172]  And we were just so blown away at all the things that, the information that was in there.
[01:33:49.392 --> 01:33:52.415]  And, you know, I've been doing this, watching it for a while now.
[01:33:54.431 --> 01:33:55.492]  Are you on a regular phone, Nick?
[01:33:55.512 --> 01:33:57.152]  Because I can't have my ears blasted again.
[01:33:57.212 --> 01:33:58.512]  Yeah, I'm on a regular phone.
[01:33:58.633 --> 01:33:59.273]  That was strange.
[01:33:59.533 --> 01:34:00.793]  I'm sorry, I'm on a regular phone.
[01:34:02.334 --> 01:34:16.738]  But anyway, one of the things that really struck us was that comment that you had made about the JFK when he signed the Executive Order 11110 that didn't let the Federal Reserve print the money anymore.
[01:34:16.998 --> 01:34:17.238]  Yep.
[01:34:18.018 --> 01:34:19.578]  And those certificates are out there.
[01:34:19.598 --> 01:34:21.299]  I looked on eBay, and they're out there.
[01:34:21.980 --> 01:34:26.703]  Anyway... No, it's all true, but, you know... Yeah, it's all true, and the thing is, like, he was dead.
[01:34:26.843 --> 01:34:28.003]  You know, I was listening to you.
[01:34:28.063 --> 01:34:40.230]  I was one of those Reagan or Bush-loving brain-dead people, and I'm waking up, and I'm starting to wake up people slowly around me thanks to this information, and I go right on the Internet, and I show them in black and white.
[01:34:40.310 --> 01:34:41.590]  I say, don't believe me.
[01:34:41.770 --> 01:34:42.811]  Go on for yourself.
[01:34:43.431 --> 01:34:44.752]  But anyway, I had a question.
[01:34:44.912 --> 01:34:48.674]  I'm severely disabled, and I have no illusions about what...
[01:34:49.249 --> 01:34:52.071]  Hitler did to the disabled and the elderly and the infirm.
[01:34:52.751 --> 01:35:09.821]  But realistically, when it does all go down, what are really the chances that we have, or I have, or someone like me have, when the goon squad comes in and they rip you out of your house and they threaten to take you away?
[01:35:09.841 --> 01:35:15.865]  I know I'm not in a very good situation, so realistically, what can Americans really do?
[01:35:15.965 --> 01:35:17.226]  Can we really defeat
[01:35:17.816 --> 01:35:20.518]  This beast called the New World Order.
[01:35:21.339 --> 01:35:22.580]  Well, number one, I'm not griping at you.
[01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:23.861]  It just almost blew my eardrums out.
[01:35:23.881 --> 01:35:24.762]  No, no, I understand.
[01:35:25.283 --> 01:35:26.484]  I was just hoping you didn't come back.
[01:35:26.544 --> 01:35:27.705]  Let me just say this.
[01:35:28.706 --> 01:35:33.090]  We almost hope they overplay their hand and try one big giant clamp down.
[01:35:33.150 --> 01:35:34.331]  That will definitely fail.
[01:35:35.026 --> 01:35:39.428]  But if it's this incremental clap down, the goon squads are out there every day thinking they're doing good.
[01:35:39.849 --> 01:35:45.752]  You've got to call in to talk shows, start websites, speak out, all of us doing little things together.
[01:35:46.112 --> 01:35:50.374]  It's not individuals by ourselves overturning the whole New World Order.
[01:35:50.454 --> 01:35:57.258]  It's a collective effort against the globalists from whatever quadrant or area we're in, whatever expertise, skills we have.
[01:35:58.804 --> 01:36:02.866]  And, again, if you look at all the poll numbers, the average cop's awake, pro-Second Amendment.
[01:36:03.267 --> 01:36:05.248]  The military's awake, anti-New World Order.
[01:36:06.248 --> 01:36:09.610]  The problem is the leadership is all controlled by the establishment.
[01:36:10.050 --> 01:36:11.211]  We have to point that out.
[01:36:11.231 --> 01:36:17.734]  We have to point out that they own both parties, that Barack Obama isn't going to save us, that they want to try to, quote, bring the country back together.
[01:36:17.974 --> 01:36:19.555]  We want the country, quote, divided.
[01:36:21.316 --> 01:36:23.017]  It's not divided the people against the people.
[01:36:23.397 --> 01:36:25.238]  It's the people now don't like the government.
[01:36:25.458 --> 01:36:29.941]  So, see, when they say, bring us back together, oh, he's like Reagan.
[01:36:30.261 --> 01:36:31.441]  He brings us back together.
[01:36:31.701 --> 01:36:33.142]  We don't want to be brought back together.
[01:36:33.662 --> 01:36:36.984]  We don't want to be brought back to being a bunch of idiots believing the government.
[01:36:37.885 --> 01:36:41.546]  And so we need to continue to discredit them and continue to expose them.
[01:36:43.567 --> 01:36:48.430]  They may succeed in destroying us financially, but they're not going to get through a lot of the other things they want.
[01:36:48.510 --> 01:36:50.671]  I mean, we're giving them fight right now
[01:36:51.354 --> 01:36:55.657]  We're giving them just an incredible fisticuffs right now.
[01:36:55.677 --> 01:36:57.758]  And so know this.
[01:36:57.838 --> 01:37:05.864]  As long as you've got good family around you, in the near term, I mean the next ten years, they're not going to be able to drag you off and euthanize you.
[01:37:07.765 --> 01:37:15.450]  Though they're starting to try to move, and it could happen quicker than that, most things are where the families allow them to euthanize somebody who gets paralyzed neck down.
[01:37:15.470 --> 01:37:18.592]  There are thousands of cases where you're begging for food and water and they kill you.
[01:37:19.392 --> 01:37:24.555]  I was thinking maybe as I was listening to you that the powers that be, the New World Order, all these financial people, their own problem could implode on them.
[01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:41.100]  Well, exactly.
[01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:45.921]  The problem is the system, the infrastructure's already been set up for command and control tyranny.
[01:37:46.241 --> 01:37:49.022]  The public's already been trained, so evil's like shark teeth.
[01:37:49.442 --> 01:37:55.464]  People wonder why, no matter what government it is or what society or what age in history, evil almost always gets in.
[01:37:55.964 --> 01:37:58.684]  It's because the structure, you know, it's like a groove.
[01:37:58.804 --> 01:38:00.565]  Water flows in canyons, right?
[01:38:01.245 --> 01:38:04.146]  Tyranny has made a canyon, you understand?
[01:38:04.986 --> 01:38:06.526]  You've heard the term stuck in a rut?
[01:38:06.866 --> 01:38:07.186]  Oh, yeah.
[01:38:07.607 --> 01:38:09.567]  That's because why is it hard to get out of a rut?
[01:38:10.385 --> 01:38:11.826]  Because it's a rut.
[01:38:13.148 --> 01:38:14.209]  The lowest point of gravity.
[01:38:14.229 --> 01:38:16.771]  The wheel keeps spinning.
[01:38:16.791 --> 01:38:17.212]  Exactly.
[01:38:17.232 --> 01:38:18.393]  We're stuck in the rut.
[01:38:19.153 --> 01:38:22.036]  And so even if George Bush goes, Barack Obama comes in.
[01:38:22.096 --> 01:38:23.958]  The evil will continue.
[01:38:23.978 --> 01:38:24.639]  It doesn't matter.
[01:38:24.699 --> 01:38:25.980]  They're just puppets themselves.
[01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:27.081]  Scared little puppets.
[01:38:27.984 --> 01:38:30.526]  And that's what I'm going to talk about next hour after some more calls.
[01:38:30.806 --> 01:38:32.467]  The globalists have even lost control.
[01:38:32.847 --> 01:38:40.892]  Well, I'd like to let you know from my point of view, there are people who mocked me like they did in that video when you were at the Grand Canyon and they just laughed.
[01:38:41.393 --> 01:38:42.173]  They were brain dead.
[01:38:42.653 --> 01:38:49.137]  But there are people that are starting to listen to me and I am going to take the DVDs that I bought from you with your permission and burn them.
[01:38:49.237 --> 01:38:49.738]  Of course.
[01:38:50.318 --> 01:38:51.219]  Not my permission.
[01:38:51.339 --> 01:38:52.119]  I beg you to.
[01:38:52.379 --> 01:38:56.222]  Yeah, well, I do thank you for your work and people are waking up over here
[01:38:56.941 --> 01:38:58.822]  And hopefully I can do something.
[01:38:59.142 --> 01:39:00.763]  Joe, good to hear from you.
[01:39:00.783 --> 01:39:01.364]  You're awesome.
[01:39:02.604 --> 01:39:03.745]  And I'll pray for your disability.
[01:39:03.765 --> 01:39:04.366]  Everybody should.
[01:39:04.406 --> 01:39:04.626]  Look.
[01:39:06.107 --> 01:39:07.247]  Yeah, I'm at the Grand Canyon.
[01:39:07.607 --> 01:39:11.310]  They've got UN signs that say under UN treaty, it's under UN control.
[01:39:11.410 --> 01:39:12.630]  Now that's openly being announced.
[01:39:13.411 --> 01:39:14.712]  Legislatures threw it out.
[01:39:14.792 --> 01:39:15.632]  Governments fought it.
[01:39:15.652 --> 01:39:16.713]  We had their own documents.
[01:39:17.213 --> 01:39:18.994]  And I walk into the Grand Canyon politely.
[01:39:19.094 --> 01:39:19.635]  It's all on video.
[01:39:19.695 --> 01:39:20.595]  And I go, hi, how are you doing?
[01:39:21.255 --> 01:39:25.358]  I'd like to talk to one of the rangers in charge of the United Nations designation.
[01:39:27.060 --> 01:39:34.742]  Woman comes out, flipping out, like a one-horn, one-eyed, flying purple people eater was sitting in their office.
[01:39:34.782 --> 01:39:38.083]  I mean, it was like I was Satan had materialized.
[01:39:39.044 --> 01:39:41.504]  I had 14 heads with acid dripping out.
[01:39:42.325 --> 01:39:43.945]  And she says, get back here right now.
[01:39:44.405 --> 01:39:45.546]  Why are you asking about that?
[01:39:45.646 --> 01:39:46.486]  Who are you with?
[01:39:47.026 --> 01:39:48.246]  Are you some type of evil group?
[01:39:48.306 --> 01:39:49.467]  Are you some type of militia?
[01:39:50.947 --> 01:39:52.368]  And I was, but it's America.
[01:39:52.388 --> 01:39:53.788]  She said, get that camera off.
[01:39:55.031 --> 01:39:55.673]  Oh, my gosh.
[01:39:55.733 --> 01:39:56.936]  Oh, my gosh.
[01:39:57.398 --> 01:39:58.320]  I heard you were coming.
[01:39:58.581 --> 01:40:00.085]  Obviously, intelligence told her or something.
[01:40:00.105 --> 01:40:00.947]  I hadn't even talked about it.
[01:40:01.268 --> 01:40:02.091]  That was in 97.
[01:40:02.592 --> 01:40:03.454]  I was nobody then.
[01:40:04.531 --> 01:40:10.873]  And then I go out to the Grand Canyon, the main lookout point there, and I just said, ladies and gentlemen, this has been taken over by the UN.
[01:40:11.293 --> 01:40:13.554]  And they're like, he's talking to us.
[01:40:13.574 --> 01:40:15.915]  You're not supposed to do that as an American.
[01:40:15.935 --> 01:40:17.896]  He's speaking to a crowd.
[01:40:17.916 --> 01:40:20.757]  He's supposed to shut up and only watch television.
[01:40:20.797 --> 01:40:26.238]  I mean, Americans were all about telling other Americans things and about warning people and being involved.
[01:40:26.759 --> 01:40:29.179]  We've had everything we are taken away from us.
[01:40:32.060 --> 01:40:34.001]  We have literally been gelded
[01:40:35.718 --> 01:40:38.579]  And we cannot continue to go along with this.
[01:40:38.599 --> 01:40:40.460]  All right, I've got to move quicker now.
[01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:41.761]  Kevin in New York.
[01:40:42.121 --> 01:40:42.701]  You're on the air.
[01:40:42.721 --> 01:40:43.341]  Go ahead, Kevin.
[01:40:45.002 --> 01:40:45.282]  Yes, sir.
[01:40:45.982 --> 01:40:47.523]  You were talking about the drug war?
[01:40:48.423 --> 01:40:50.904]  Yes, how the government ships in the narcotics to wage war on us.
[01:40:50.924 --> 01:40:51.224]  Yes.
[01:40:51.424 --> 01:40:52.245]  I've got a question.
[01:40:52.285 --> 01:40:53.805]  You think maybe that D.A.R.E.
[01:40:53.885 --> 01:40:59.968]  program could be classified as child abuse and entrapment?
[01:41:01.488 --> 01:41:02.429]  Well, of course it is.
[01:41:02.549 --> 01:41:04.911]  They ship the drugs in, launder the money for their banks.
[01:41:05.651 --> 01:41:12.757]  The drug money laundering banks, also their specialty, is private prisons, so they put you in the prisons for using the drugs they shipped you.
[01:41:13.158 --> 01:41:17.781]  And then, like I said, it could be classified as child abuse, too.
[01:41:18.142 --> 01:41:18.342]  It is.
[01:41:20.342 --> 01:41:20.702]  Drugs?
[01:41:21.002 --> 01:41:22.263]  Well, they noticed that with the D.A.R.E.
[01:41:22.303 --> 01:41:24.363]  program that it actually made drug use go up.
[01:41:24.623 --> 01:41:25.144]  That's right.
[01:41:25.344 --> 01:41:28.745]  Just like anti-suicide programs make kids commit suicide more.
[01:41:28.765 --> 01:41:33.806]  Because they never thought about, when they're nine years old, how to snort cocaine or use heroin.
[01:41:34.226 --> 01:41:35.327]  Or shown bags of it.
[01:41:35.947 --> 01:41:41.789]  And then in a lot of those schools, again, and I saw it growing up in Dallas, the police deal the very drugs that the D.A.R.E.
[01:41:41.829 --> 01:41:42.909]  program teaches you how to use.
[01:41:43.469 --> 01:41:43.690]  Yeah.
[01:41:44.370 --> 01:41:47.671]  You know, they talk about how nobody knows anybody nowadays.
[01:41:47.971 --> 01:41:48.151]  Yeah.
[01:41:48.752 --> 01:42:02.096]  You know, back in the good old days, a hundred years ago or more, in all these projects, people used to work together to do community projects with their churches and civic groups.
[01:42:02.796 --> 01:42:04.617]  They didn't wait for the government to come and do it.
[01:42:04.637 --> 01:42:10.739]  And they loved going and building a barn and then drinking big old glasses of lemonade and maybe a beer.
[01:42:11.519 --> 01:42:14.800]  They made it a festivity doing the community program.
[01:42:15.180 --> 01:42:16.901]  But see, we replaced that with...
[01:42:18.556 --> 01:42:22.698]  With HBO and taking Prozac.
[01:42:23.039 --> 01:42:28.142]  And doing projects like that, it didn't cost them an arm and a leg in taxes either.
[01:42:29.402 --> 01:42:32.784]  Because they volunteered their time or they donated money.
[01:42:33.245 --> 01:42:34.825]  Well, men were more aggressive too.
[01:42:34.926 --> 01:42:39.928]  Men now for 50 years have had estrogen put into their diet to make us more docile.
[01:42:41.609 --> 01:42:44.451]  I mean, can you imagine men 50 years ago if all this was happening?
[01:42:45.732 --> 01:42:47.613]  Men couldn't control themselves back then.
[01:42:48.436 --> 01:42:53.300]  People were very genteel because they were so vicious.
[01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:58.904]  You had to be controlled because you had so much testosterone, you would just rip people apart.
[01:42:59.304 --> 01:43:00.585]  I appreciate your call, my friend.
[01:43:01.726 --> 01:43:10.873]  You see, but now it's the trappings of maleness, acting tough, strutting about, bugging your eyes out, where the truly vicious person isn't like that.
[01:43:11.673 --> 01:43:16.257]  They're constantly afraid of turning it loose because they want to rip somebody's head off if they get in their way.
[01:43:17.924 --> 01:43:25.151]  Most of these guys that act tough, when you actually start ripping their nose off, knocking their teeth out, and hammering their head, they start crying.
[01:43:27.994 --> 01:43:29.675]  Anyways, let's go ahead and take the next call.
[01:43:30.436 --> 01:43:32.318]  Let's go ahead and talk to Michael in Ohio.
[01:43:32.338 --> 01:43:32.938]  You're on the air.
[01:43:32.958 --> 01:43:34.360]  Hi, Alex.
[01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:37.162]  I just got back from voting early in Ohio today.
[01:43:37.182 --> 01:43:41.266]  Just thought I'd share with you that they had this thing on the voter card.
[01:43:41.286 --> 01:43:41.807]  It says...
[01:43:42.657 --> 01:43:48.721]  Voters who do not have any of the above forms of identification, including a social security number, will still be able to vote by signing an affirmation.
[01:43:49.601 --> 01:43:51.262]  I guess that's like how dead people vote or something.
[01:43:52.003 --> 01:43:54.544]  Yeah, it is, but it's a greater evil.
[01:43:55.585 --> 01:44:11.595]  They like us to focus on voter fraud, which does happen and is substantive, but compared to centralized, no-record machines designed for remote access who have a proven history of fraud, election fraud dwarfs the voter fraud.
[01:44:12.509 --> 01:44:15.632]  Yeah, I did have to request a paper route because it was on machines.
[01:44:17.253 --> 01:44:18.334]  Well, good job, my friend.
[01:44:18.354 --> 01:44:19.175]  What else is on your mind?
[01:44:20.075 --> 01:44:24.960]  Um, I just wanted to call in and let you know about that, but I guess that's all.
[01:44:25.780 --> 01:44:26.581]  Good to hear from you.
[01:44:27.101 --> 01:44:28.743]  Alex in New York, you're on the air.
[01:44:30.905 --> 01:44:31.045]  Hey.
[01:44:31.085 --> 01:44:32.106]  Hey, Mr. Jones.
[01:44:32.206 --> 01:44:33.587]  I'm sorry if I sound crackly.
[01:44:33.747 --> 01:44:36.029]  My phone's been tapped for a long time.
[01:44:36.069 --> 01:44:36.910]  Hey, that's okay.
[01:44:37.558 --> 01:44:39.020]  Or you might have water in the lines.
[01:44:40.301 --> 01:44:45.005]  You know when they tap your phone, unless it's a local group, you don't hear any sound, unless they want you to.
[01:44:46.767 --> 01:44:48.809]  It's all done at the switching center, but go ahead.
[01:44:49.490 --> 01:44:52.813]  Anyway, so I'm in kind of a unique situation.
[01:44:54.074 --> 01:44:56.416]  My brother is managing director of J.P.
[01:44:56.456 --> 01:44:57.217]  Morgan.
[01:44:57.317 --> 01:45:00.400]  My brother-in-law is head of real estate for Carlisle Group.
[01:45:00.819 --> 01:45:03.321]  My other brother... Oh, well, you probably do have your phone tapped.
[01:45:03.361 --> 01:45:03.681]  Okay.
[01:45:03.741 --> 01:45:08.043]  Yeah, my other brother's head of finance for the Carnegie Foundation.
[01:45:08.064 --> 01:45:09.184]  Just ridiculous.
[01:45:10.185 --> 01:45:17.089]  But I talk to them about these things, and they know a lot of what I'm talking about, but they're for it.
[01:45:17.149 --> 01:45:19.070]  Now, I cannot reach them.
[01:45:19.130 --> 01:45:21.672]  I'm sure you have more experience talking to people.
[01:45:21.692 --> 01:45:24.314]  Well, they don't want to be reached because they're doing well in the system.
[01:45:25.134 --> 01:45:26.055]  Right, exactly.
[01:45:26.095 --> 01:45:28.156]  But how do you reach them to...
[01:45:28.689 --> 01:45:35.191]  Make them understand that if the system can do this to other people, then it's just an absolute truth that they can do it to them, too.
[01:45:36.791 --> 01:45:39.572]  Well, it's not just they can do it to you.
[01:45:39.672 --> 01:45:40.753]  Do you want that?
[01:45:40.773 --> 01:45:49.755]  I mean, do you want that on your soul to know that you're hurting innocent people, dumbing people down, engaging in mass murder by your tacit support of the system?
[01:45:49.955 --> 01:45:52.636]  And then they'll say, well, I don't believe in a God, so so what?
[01:45:53.231 --> 01:45:59.036]  Well, even in life, your brain is designed to try to help other people, to do good for your tribe.
[01:45:59.496 --> 01:46:04.260]  You're not going to be fulfilled, even if you're a psychopath or a sociopath, doing wrong.
[01:46:05.201 --> 01:46:10.285]  How do you explain that to someone who's driven solely by the desire for money and capital gains?
[01:46:10.565 --> 01:46:11.346]  Well, it's not just that.
[01:46:11.366 --> 01:46:12.467]  It's the competitiveness.
[01:46:14.105 --> 01:46:16.347]  I mean, it even gets to me.
[01:46:16.727 --> 01:46:24.254]  Like other people in the patriot movement attacking me, telling me I shouldn't have sponsors, telling me I shouldn't be successful, jealous of me.
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:27.762]  I shouldn't fight the New World Order because of that.
[01:46:27.782 --> 01:46:30.183]  And I mainly fight it because we've got to stop them, we've got to survive.
[01:46:30.523 --> 01:46:36.106]  But almost in my own genre, I want to dominate because I know it makes them so mad.
[01:46:36.706 --> 01:46:38.888]  And until a few years ago, I wasn't like that.
[01:46:39.628 --> 01:46:41.529]  And then I've even kind of, it's like a disease.
[01:46:41.589 --> 01:46:44.871]  You can't help but be, you know, competitive.
[01:46:44.891 --> 01:46:46.872]  Now, I don't break any rules to be competitive.
[01:46:48.093 --> 01:46:51.635]  But I know what upsets a lot of other talk show hosts, and I get such a big yes.
[01:46:51.655 --> 01:46:53.896]  So I said, well, why don't I just get even more of them?
[01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:58.003]  Or I know it upsets them, you know, that I get a sponsor or two and it makes them mad.
[01:46:58.043 --> 01:46:59.285]  I go, well, it's a free country.
[01:46:59.305 --> 01:47:01.627]  How about I get a whole bunch and expand what I'm doing?
[01:47:01.667 --> 01:47:08.633]  And, you know, it's sick because I should be fighting the New World Order because I want to survive and beat them.
[01:47:09.094 --> 01:47:17.281]  But it's almost like I can tell what happened to your brothers because you just get competitive and you're like, you know what, you little scumbag, you want to try to dominate me?
[01:47:17.601 --> 01:47:19.043]  We'll see who the best man is.
[01:47:19.648 --> 01:47:21.688]  Yeah, that is the mentality there.
[01:47:22.068 --> 01:47:23.429]  Yeah, I fully understand.
[01:47:23.529 --> 01:47:25.609]  I mean, you know, they've still got their huevos.
[01:47:26.849 --> 01:47:34.751]  But see, a real man has to go to another level and never compromise their morals, which I've never done.
[01:47:34.771 --> 01:47:35.651]  I will not do it.
[01:47:35.711 --> 01:47:44.032]  I mean, people kind of poo-poo the fact that I've been offered sellouts and offered big national shows and all this in the past, and I said no to it.
[01:47:44.072 --> 01:47:48.933]  But then those very people that don't act like it, I see them, in a minute they'd sell out, and I've seen them sell out.
[01:47:50.009 --> 01:47:50.389]  You see?
[01:47:51.010 --> 01:47:53.112]  But see, to me it isn't even selling out.
[01:47:53.412 --> 01:47:57.195]  Who I am, what I stand for, is incontrovertible.
[01:47:57.435 --> 01:48:02.660]  I can't change who I am, A. B, I would never change it because that's what's valuable to me.
[01:48:02.980 --> 01:48:06.003]  It's who I am, that I do the right thing, that I am a good guy.
[01:48:06.909 --> 01:48:28.704]  You know, that's, and I know I'm right, and I do my research, and I know I understand their system, and I'm not even afraid of them killing me, because at a very base, hardwired level of my brain, that's what a warrior does, is they don't want to die, but they go out and face the enemy and take on the risk for the tribe, no matter what the cost is, I am committed, and that is a good feeling.
[01:48:29.425 --> 01:48:36.030]  I feel like it's the difference between being driven by principle and being driven by desire, material desire.
[01:48:37.606 --> 01:48:38.026]  Exactly.
[01:48:38.046 --> 01:48:42.308]  And not even a material desire, it's the desire to win.
[01:48:43.388 --> 01:48:47.410]  Why do men want power, want money, want prestige?
[01:48:47.530 --> 01:48:50.851]  It comes down at first when you're young to wanting the better women.
[01:48:51.571 --> 01:48:53.412]  It is a species drive.
[01:48:54.412 --> 01:49:02.635]  Okay, but then later, once you've got your wife and your kids and you've got that hierarchy of needs met, then generally as you get older, it's all these enemies.
[01:49:03.562 --> 01:49:10.905]  Some people I know in Hollywood who are worth hundreds of millions of dollars, they don't do what they do and get up in the morning because they want more money.
[01:49:10.945 --> 01:49:15.607]  It's because all these people wanted them to fail, and they're going to continue to show them, I'm not going to fail.
[01:49:16.387 --> 01:49:18.848]  That is what their driving force has been.
[01:49:18.888 --> 01:49:22.250]  They're mostly people that grew up poor.
[01:49:22.330 --> 01:49:25.371]  We all grew up poor, and then they ended up succeeding.
[01:49:26.291 --> 01:49:27.752]  That is a lot of their motivation.
[01:49:28.416 --> 01:49:29.477]  No, no, that's totally it.
[01:49:29.537 --> 01:49:32.879]  And so we've got to self-analyze ourselves.
[01:49:32.919 --> 01:49:33.419]  Anything else?
[01:49:34.540 --> 01:49:35.201]  Yeah.
[01:49:36.502 --> 01:49:38.943]  I'm part of the Ron Paul group out here in New York.
[01:49:39.003 --> 01:49:42.786]  We're the most active one out here, even though we're not necessarily the biggest one.
[01:49:42.806 --> 01:49:43.226]  Sure, sure.
[01:49:44.167 --> 01:49:47.249]  But what we are doing is we are starting a 501c3.
[01:49:49.808 --> 01:49:51.951]  Beyond just the Ron Paul campaign.
[01:49:51.971 --> 01:49:52.311]  Stay there.
[01:49:52.351 --> 01:49:53.172]  I want to hear about this.
[01:49:53.432 --> 01:49:53.973]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:54.353 --> 01:49:54.994]  It's a fact.
[01:49:55.214 --> 01:50:02.703]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[01:50:02.823 --> 01:50:06.407]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates...
[01:50:06.527 --> 01:50:06.787]  I think so.
[01:50:29.028 --> 01:50:29.508]  Visit FDRS.org today.
[01:50:54.511 --> 01:50:56.193]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[01:50:56.513 --> 01:50:59.977]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:51:00.137 --> 01:51:02.060]  But in liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:05.343]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:51:05.664 --> 01:51:09.428]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding
[01:51:09.488 --> 01:51:09.828]  I don't know.
[01:51:30.085 --> 01:51:30.886]  And so much more.
[01:51:31.266 --> 01:51:33.247]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.
[01:51:33.307 --> 01:51:34.247]  Join PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:51:36.789 --> 01:51:38.389]  Bring down the New World Order.

[01:53:01.638 --> 01:53:07.243]  Alright, I'm going to take a call from Christian, Steve, and Dan after Alex, Mark 2.
[01:53:08.644 --> 01:53:11.346]  Then I've got a couple audio clips I want to play that are very important.
[01:53:12.507 --> 01:53:16.290]  I want to comment on the true cost of what we face in society.
[01:53:17.731 --> 01:53:19.372]  And I've got a news blitz coming up.
[01:53:19.412 --> 01:53:20.894]  I've really got to hurry through these calls.
[01:53:22.034 --> 01:53:24.737]  Going back to Christian, finish up real fast.
[01:53:24.797 --> 01:53:25.617]  No, I'm not Christian.
[01:53:26.278 --> 01:53:27.419]  To Alex in New York.
[01:53:28.175 --> 01:53:32.337]  About taking your Ron Paul Group and continuing it on.
[01:53:32.717 --> 01:53:36.719]  And that's what we've got to do, is not let this all just disappear like vapor at dawn.
[01:53:36.739 --> 01:53:41.461]  We need to now take these millions of people that are activated and set goals against the globalists.
[01:53:41.481 --> 01:53:41.901]  Go ahead.
[01:53:43.082 --> 01:53:48.924]  So what my Ron Paul Group is doing is we're starting a 501c3 nonprofit organization.
[01:53:49.785 --> 01:53:54.347]  And we've gotten in contact with different public access TV channels out here.
[01:53:54.387 --> 01:53:57.468]  And we're going to actually have a public access
[01:53:58.066 --> 01:54:00.529]  You know, they don't have enough infiltrators to get to all the groups.
[01:54:00.569 --> 01:54:02.170]  There are so many thousands.
[01:54:20.453 --> 01:54:22.834]  But you're going to have mental cases and some infiltrators.
[01:54:23.474 --> 01:54:29.035]  And just as soon as somebody calls for violence, you just have by-rules of the group that people agree to to join.
[01:54:29.555 --> 01:54:31.216]  And then you elect the heads of it.
[01:54:31.676 --> 01:54:33.576]  And I wouldn't get into little petty power things.
[01:54:33.976 --> 01:54:38.097]  And then somebody starts saying, hey, let's bomb something or let's do something and say, hey, we're going to report you to the police.
[01:54:38.577 --> 01:54:40.738]  Just have it in your rules that you'll report that to the police.
[01:54:41.358 --> 01:54:55.732]  And then just follow them out, get their plate number, have somebody follow them, and they'll go home, they'll be a local cop or FBI, and then you just go to the media with it, and you go on air and say this FBI guy came by and called for violence, and that's how you burn them.
[01:54:56.152 --> 01:54:57.333]  Then you call for criminal charges.
[01:54:57.353 --> 01:54:57.974]  Appreciate the call.
[01:54:58.795 --> 01:55:02.818]  That's how you handle them, and they run real fast, folks, when they come up.
[01:55:03.278 --> 01:55:04.939]  I just go, look, you dumb cop.
[01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:06.820]  We're not criminals like you.
[01:55:07.121 --> 01:55:09.122]  We're not going to engage in violence, you criminal.
[01:55:09.542 --> 01:55:15.006]  You're trying to come set up a peaceful group so we don't have good political speech and so we can't take our country back.
[01:55:15.506 --> 01:55:16.727]  I'm going to call the police on you.
[01:55:17.027 --> 01:55:20.790]  Now, nothing happens to them, but they get in trouble, and then they start leaving you alone.
[01:55:21.718 --> 01:55:24.500]  Cops will also approach and go, We've got to have security.
[01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:27.843]  We've got to stay real quiet and stick together and only listen to me.
[01:55:28.223 --> 01:55:29.624]  We can't have new members in the group.
[01:55:29.984 --> 01:55:31.005]  Everybody's watching us.
[01:55:31.025 --> 01:55:33.487]  We've got to wear camo and meet in the woods.
[01:55:34.167 --> 01:55:34.788]  I've got a gun.
[01:55:34.828 --> 01:55:35.789]  I want to sell you.
[01:55:35.889 --> 01:55:37.069]  It's fully auto.
[01:55:38.551 --> 01:55:39.491]  That's a cop, folks.
[01:55:39.852 --> 01:55:40.452]  That's a fed.
[01:55:41.132 --> 01:55:42.193]  And they hate America.
[01:55:42.574 --> 01:55:44.675]  Most of them are child molesters.
[01:55:44.695 --> 01:55:46.677]  They've got criminal backgrounds themselves.
[01:55:46.977 --> 01:55:47.737]  They're informants.
[01:55:47.837 --> 01:55:48.878]  I'm serious when I say that.
[01:55:48.898 --> 01:55:51.240]  I mean, who else could the scum get to work for them?
[01:55:51.849 --> 01:55:53.290]  The good cops and people won't do this.
[01:55:54.050 --> 01:55:55.591]  And you just want to stay away from them.
[01:55:56.172 --> 01:55:58.233]  You want to wear a suit and tie, be out in the open.
[01:55:58.713 --> 01:55:59.513]  We're the good guys.
[01:55:59.553 --> 01:56:00.554]  They're the sneaky people.
[01:56:02.555 --> 01:56:06.878]  All right, I'm almost out of time for this hour.
[01:56:09.059 --> 01:56:11.080]  I will cover all this news, and there's so much of it.
[01:56:11.120 --> 01:56:11.600]  Stay with us.
[01:56:13.421 --> 01:56:13.942]  In fact, you know what?
[01:56:13.962 --> 01:56:16.103]  I'm just going to cover news first, and we'll get back, then I'll go to your calls.
[01:56:16.743 --> 01:56:17.724]  So I've got to get through all this.
[01:56:19.053 --> 01:56:32.260]  Before I go any further, special teleclass for herbal essentials, 10 herbs you must have for great health, Tuesday, March 4th, at 8 p.m., 7 p.m.
[01:56:32.300 --> 01:56:33.061]  Central, 6 p.m.
[01:56:33.101 --> 01:56:34.181]  Mountain, 5 p.m.
[01:56:34.221 --> 01:56:34.741]  Pacific.
[01:56:35.062 --> 01:56:40.424]  The topic is herbal essentials, the top 10 herbs you must have on hand for emergencies and everyday use.
[01:56:41.625 --> 01:56:46.908]  And what you do is you call the Inner Food line, Inner Health Botanicals,
[01:56:47.645 --> 01:56:57.070]  And when you call that number, you then punch in a particular code.
[01:56:57.870 --> 01:56:59.050]  So again, 866-762-9238.
[01:57:00.031 --> 01:57:03.212]  You can call them and ask them questions about it.
[01:57:03.232 --> 01:57:07.975]  866-762-9238 or enerfood.com.
[01:57:08.235 --> 01:57:14.658]  They have a bunch of great whole food, green foods, healthy coffees, you name it.
[01:57:17.225 --> 01:57:22.490]  And when you call the number, you just punch the star, and it'll put you through straight to it.
[01:57:22.891 --> 01:57:23.371]  All right.
[01:57:23.972 --> 01:57:28.336]  The third hour is only 70 seconds away.
[01:57:29.036 --> 01:57:30.398]  We shall return.
[01:57:30.418 --> 01:57:31.439]  Stay with us.
[01:57:31.459 --> 01:57:32.740]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:57:32.780 --> 01:57:35.723]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:57:50.524 --> 01:57:51.165]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.825 --> 01:57:52.906]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.607 --> 01:57:54.688]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.348 --> 01:57:56.169]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.929 --> 01:57:57.830]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.850 --> 01:58:02.214]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.674 --> 01:58:06.798]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.958 --> 01:58:12.783]  All right, I'm just going to read headlines right now, and then I'm going to go back through some of these stories in more detail.
[01:58:14.304 --> 01:58:14.564]  U.S.
[01:58:14.584 --> 01:58:17.566]  lawmakers blast Boeing defense contract snob.
[01:58:18.347 --> 01:58:19.128]  French company...
[01:58:20.456 --> 01:58:21.237]  Gets the deal.
[01:58:23.439 --> 01:58:25.181]  North of Grumman's French division.
[01:58:27.684 --> 01:58:29.806]  People are saying the American Boeing doesn't get it.
[01:58:29.846 --> 01:58:30.907]  Boeing's in China now.
[01:58:30.947 --> 01:58:31.948]  Boeing's not American.
[01:58:32.889 --> 01:58:34.450]  For those that didn't get the news flash.
[01:58:35.652 --> 01:58:42.619]  Also, I'm going to play a clip from Doomsday 2012, the end of days, fear-mongering on the History Channel.
[01:58:43.732 --> 01:58:45.193]  I want to comment on that coming up.
[01:58:45.833 --> 01:58:48.435]  As you know, gold went above $103 a barrel.
[01:58:48.835 --> 01:58:54.179]  Gold above $990 an ounce today.
[01:58:55.159 --> 01:58:58.041]  Exposed to military, chemical, and biological warfare test.
[01:58:58.561 --> 01:58:59.982]  They walk among us.
[01:59:00.582 --> 01:59:08.267]  CNET News admitting all the mind control programs and all the chemical and biological, radiological spraying on the troops.
[01:59:08.808 --> 01:59:10.789]  As bad as this sounds, it's a big whitewash.
[01:59:12.951 --> 01:59:16.835]  Desperate Smear campaign follows actress on 9-11 comments.
[01:59:17.816 --> 01:59:21.999]  Marion Cartier has come out saying she believes 9-11 is an inside job.
[01:59:22.019 --> 01:59:24.061]  I'm going to comment on that more later.
[01:59:24.121 --> 01:59:25.522]  She's best actress this year.
[01:59:27.604 --> 01:59:32.008]  OPEC is saying that they are rethinking production cut plans.
[01:59:33.569 --> 01:59:36.492]  They're saying that they've cut production in the last six months.
[01:59:37.162 --> 01:59:41.344]  And oil's at all-time prices, but only for Americans, because the dollar's being devalued.
[01:59:41.704 --> 01:59:45.645]  When the news announces it, they don't explain that, that it's the dollar devaluation.
[01:59:46.226 --> 01:59:51.087]  To the contrary, the Fed chief gets up and says it has nothing to do with oil going up.
[01:59:54.169 --> 01:59:56.530]  I laugh about this because it's just getting too sick.
[01:59:57.310 --> 01:59:59.871]  OPEC, Rethinking Production Cut Plans.
[02:00:00.689 --> 02:00:03.271]  With high oil prices weighing on a struggling U.S.
[02:00:03.311 --> 02:00:09.756]  economy, the OPEC oil cartel is... You mean there's groups of cartels that have monopolies?
[02:00:09.836 --> 02:00:11.178]  That doesn't exist, the media said.
[02:00:11.638 --> 02:00:15.861]  Plans to cut production this week, which could push prices above their current record levels.
[02:00:16.502 --> 02:00:20.785]  Instead, OPEC is likely to keep its output unchanged when its members meet Wednesday.
[02:00:20.805 --> 02:00:21.606]  Oh, how nice of them.
[02:00:25.229 --> 02:00:26.290]  Continuing here...
[02:00:28.092 --> 02:00:29.313]  Turkey tells U.S.
[02:00:29.493 --> 02:00:32.455]  its troops will stay in Iraq for as long as necessary.
[02:00:32.995 --> 02:00:46.142]  They told them that last Friday, but then, of course, Secretary of Defense, former Spook Chief Gates, said, well, you need to get them out, and they did the next day, pulled them out, so they left Friday.
[02:00:46.162 --> 02:00:48.824]  House of Cards.
[02:00:48.924 --> 02:00:53.787]  Consumers turned to credit cards amid mortgage crisis, delaying inevitable defaults.
[02:00:55.242 --> 02:00:57.103]  We've got a little news clip about this.
[02:00:57.143 --> 02:01:02.387]  The Center for American Progress had a report giving all the different labor statistics, U.S.
[02:01:02.427 --> 02:01:03.628]  credit market statistics.
[02:01:05.049 --> 02:01:08.711]  People are just further maxing out their already record debt.
[02:01:08.851 --> 02:01:12.674]  Now, in January of 2007, we broke the record of December 1933 as the worst...
[02:01:17.011 --> 02:01:19.433]  Debt load for private citizens in U.S.
[02:01:19.453 --> 02:01:19.793]  history.
[02:01:20.254 --> 02:01:21.355]  The depth of the Depression.
[02:01:21.615 --> 02:01:23.156]  We passed that more than a year ago.
[02:01:23.716 --> 02:01:27.359]  Now they are just piling on with record credit cards.
[02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:35.305]  Just absolute pedal to the metal on that front.
[02:01:36.345 --> 02:01:42.109]  And so that's why middle of next year is when the cats and dogs eating each other, the...
[02:01:43.564 --> 02:01:46.906]  Bedlam in the streets, the total meltdown, if it's going to happen, it's going to happen.
[02:01:47.306 --> 02:01:55.750]  All of this is just a prelude with pundits running around saying how wonderful the economy is and Al-Qaeda caused it to happen.
[02:01:56.090 --> 02:01:58.291]  You don't say the economy's great, you're with Al-Qaeda.
[02:01:58.891 --> 02:02:01.993]  We actually have newscasts where they say that you're helping the terrorists.
[02:02:02.433 --> 02:02:05.894]  If you don't like the Federal Reserve raping you, you're with Al-Qaeda.
[02:02:06.334 --> 02:02:11.617]  The blonde-haired, blue-eyed, tens of thousands strong, they work for bin Laden, they're everywhere.
[02:02:14.165 --> 02:02:19.287]  A book warns 9-11 was a precursor to the collapse of the world's fiscal superpowers.
[02:02:19.687 --> 02:02:21.328]  Famine, plague, and World War III.
[02:02:21.348 --> 02:02:23.109]  That's out of the Toronto Sun.
[02:02:23.129 --> 02:02:23.909]  We'll try to get into that.

[02:02:28.491 --> 02:02:30.152]  World stock markets are all down.
[02:02:31.326 --> 02:02:34.508]  I got a bunch of other news we haven't even gotten to that I'll shotgun through.

[02:02:41.631 --> 02:02:42.852]  It is super powerful.

[02:04:45.706 --> 02:04:51.349]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH balanced alkaline environment.
[02:04:51.549 --> 02:04:56.691]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[02:04:56.971 --> 02:05:02.054]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[02:05:02.334 --> 02:05:04.115]  People who alkalize the water they drink
[02:05:04.375 --> 02:05:07.918]  Experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[02:05:08.238 --> 02:05:14.243]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[02:05:14.483 --> 02:05:18.006]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[02:05:18.266 --> 02:05:22.810]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[02:05:23.090 --> 02:05:23.871]  Do your part.
[02:05:24.131 --> 02:05:26.393]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now.

[02:05:36.661 --> 02:05:38.363]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:58.454 --> 02:06:05.315]  Gold futures for the next week are trading above $9.92, so that means it's only going to continue to trend up.
[02:06:05.375 --> 02:06:06.796]  Those are almost always accurate.
[02:06:10.156 --> 02:06:12.837]  I know we've got Christian, Mark, Steve, Dan, many others.
[02:06:13.377 --> 02:06:14.997]  We've got a bunch of audio clips I want to play.
[02:06:15.277 --> 02:06:22.739]  Let's play this one first about House of Cards, dealing with the economy being even fully more leveraged into debt.
[02:06:22.759 --> 02:06:23.079]  Here it is.
[02:06:23.658 --> 02:06:29.642]  On the credit front, the biggest insurer in the world said, yes, subprime the problem, and that caused them to have their first loss ever.
[02:06:29.942 --> 02:06:32.844]  But it isn't a credit problem that is just affecting Wall Street anymore.
[02:06:33.245 --> 02:06:37.808]  Right now, the credit problem is affecting regular Americans, too.
[02:06:37.828 --> 02:06:45.693]  34-year-old Jack Zantino and his wife, Betty, found themselves with severe financial problems after the housing crisis hit northern Nevada late last year.
[02:06:46.233 --> 02:06:50.156]  Betty, a real estate agent, was bringing little home, and Jack lost his job.
[02:06:51.334 --> 02:06:54.720]  Jack says he knew they were in big trouble when they broke the 20,000 mark early on.
[02:07:03.544 --> 02:07:04.765]  The Zantinos are not alone.
[02:07:05.165 --> 02:07:12.912]  More and more Americans are saying charge it, using their credit cards to pay rents and mortgages, surging fuel and food costs, as well as daily expenses.
[02:07:13.252 --> 02:07:25.743]  A report released this month by the consumer group Center for American Progress claims banks have made it harder to get a mortgage now than any time in the past 17 years, while at the same time pushing credit cards to make up for the lost business.
[02:07:26.443 --> 02:07:29.686]  Credit card debt now at a record, close to a trillion dollars.
[02:07:30.160 --> 02:07:34.263]  Credit bureau counselors and financial analysts report a credit card binge across the nation.
[02:07:34.824 --> 02:07:37.225]  People use their plastic to stay financially afloat.
[02:07:38.126 --> 02:07:42.669]  It's happening most significantly in parts of the country where the housing and mortgage markets are a complete mess.
[02:07:42.729 --> 02:07:45.311]  California, Arizona... And it goes on and on.
[02:07:45.532 --> 02:07:47.913]  It's up on Infowars.com if you want to see it.
[02:07:47.973 --> 02:07:49.875]  So, let's get this straight.
[02:07:51.856 --> 02:07:52.477]  Since 2001 until late 2007...
[02:07:58.462 --> 02:08:06.027]  The federal government claimed we were in a boom, coming out of recession in late 2001, early 2002, they claim.
[02:08:08.468 --> 02:08:16.513]  The average individual income went down by $1,006, according to the Congressional Budget Office and their numbers.
[02:08:16.934 --> 02:08:18.454]  We've got Dr. Roberts on the cover of this.
[02:08:19.835 --> 02:08:25.539]  So the average person lost over $1,000 a year in overall income, in what they were paid.
[02:08:27.230 --> 02:08:32.972]  Now, how is that a booming economy when you've lost $1,000 a year?
[02:08:34.432 --> 02:08:34.812]  A year!
[02:08:34.872 --> 02:08:38.093]  That was compounded over $6,000 a year in your paycheck.
[02:08:40.014 --> 02:08:41.714]  And I bet most of you are nodding your heads.
[02:08:41.774 --> 02:08:42.555]  That was the average.
[02:08:43.835 --> 02:08:44.435]  You lose $6,000 plus.
[02:08:44.455 --> 02:08:49.657]  And there were no, in six plus years, no new...
[02:08:55.149 --> 02:08:59.694]  Value-added industry jobs added.
[02:09:00.034 --> 02:09:00.515]  No new.
[02:09:00.595 --> 02:09:02.837]  In fact, they lost a few thousand.
[02:09:04.158 --> 02:09:05.360]  And that's even with cookbooks.
[02:09:06.060 --> 02:09:08.563]  So, we lost good-paying jobs.
[02:09:09.184 --> 02:09:11.326]  We gained bad-paying second jobs.
[02:09:12.227 --> 02:09:15.290]  Our pay went down $6,000 over six years.
[02:09:16.331 --> 02:09:17.312]  That is a recession.
[02:09:18.434 --> 02:09:19.475]  So, that gave the illusion...
[02:09:47.997 --> 02:09:51.158]  Of an economy that was doing well.
[02:09:54.560 --> 02:09:58.081]  Now, three years ago, I mean, people were starting to pay attention.
[02:09:58.141 --> 02:09:59.542]  We told you everything was going to happen.
[02:09:59.622 --> 02:10:00.222]  It's not hard.
[02:10:00.262 --> 02:10:04.744]  We go off our own documents and our own sources that have been vetted and proven to be accurate.
[02:10:05.064 --> 02:10:08.666]  We learned the Bilderberg Group wants to suck the middle class dry.
[02:10:09.226 --> 02:10:12.367]  They want to bring down the middle class in Europe and the U.S.
[02:10:12.807 --> 02:10:16.649]  They want to go on to the next level of the Club of Rome feudal society.
[02:10:17.242 --> 02:10:19.784]  And they say to trigger that, they were going to pop the mortgage bubble.
[02:10:21.185 --> 02:10:29.312]  A year and a half before you saw the exposés a year ago telling you about how it was going to be bad and how it was going to go down.
[02:10:29.332 --> 02:10:35.737]  It was the media saying houses were overvalued, which they were, but it was holding up the house of cards.
[02:10:36.578 --> 02:10:37.959]  And would have done it indefinitely, probably.
[02:10:38.319 --> 02:10:41.882]  That bubble, even though the dollar was being devalued, it was covering for that.
[02:10:42.202 --> 02:10:44.844]  Because it was an investment giving you more than 15-20% a year on average.
[02:10:49.358 --> 02:10:51.560]  And so they popped your lifeboat.
[02:10:52.661 --> 02:10:53.141]  Okay?
[02:10:53.201 --> 02:10:57.905]  So they could then see the lower financial orders implode and consolidate.
[02:11:01.028 --> 02:11:03.270]  Alright, I'm going to end up spending the whole hour if I don't shut up and move on.
[02:11:04.062 --> 02:11:07.383]  So, meanwhile, the central banks have decided to devalue the dollar.
[02:11:07.403 --> 02:11:09.123]  They've decided to turn up the debt.
[02:11:09.143 --> 02:11:11.464]  They've decided to increase spending wildly.
[02:11:11.884 --> 02:11:22.506]  They've decided to even give us tax rebates and $600 in the mail, which will weigh more than the value for the amount of cash you give.
[02:11:23.467 --> 02:11:24.087]  It's a scam.
[02:11:24.447 --> 02:11:26.447]  They're devaluing your currency.
[02:11:27.188 --> 02:11:28.408]  Now it's 20% a year.
[02:11:28.868 --> 02:11:32.889]  Inflation is 20%, so that's compounded with inflation, and it's worth less.
[02:11:33.874 --> 02:11:34.995]  Your savings are worth less.
[02:11:35.015 --> 02:11:38.237]  Then they're going to send you $600.
[02:11:38.597 --> 02:11:39.738]  It's a parlor trick.
[02:11:40.599 --> 02:11:44.301]  Or it's like throwing you a life preserver that has holes in it.
[02:11:45.082 --> 02:11:45.902]  It's a sick joke.
[02:11:46.763 --> 02:11:53.867]  But, again, it politically will make you continue to think they got the answer, so you'll go down with the ship with Barack Obama and the New World Order.
[02:11:54.208 --> 02:12:03.694]  See, everything's about change now and getting us back into the scam and believing the system's okay and that we really do have a choice instead of realizing it's totally bankrupt and evil and has to be replaced.
[02:12:05.592 --> 02:12:11.975]  Then they bring in Mary Madeline, married to Carville, and now they've gotten rid of all illusion.
[02:12:12.195 --> 02:12:13.736]  In the past, they wouldn't have them appear together.
[02:12:14.216 --> 02:12:20.399]  Now they have her with her husband, the Democrat, who then says the truth, but when they're in power, he'll say the lies.
[02:12:20.819 --> 02:12:22.720]  See, it's his place to play the part of the good guy.
[02:12:25.061 --> 02:12:28.462]  Just like the two brothers.
[02:12:28.602 --> 02:12:34.925]  One's a Republican, one's a Democrat, and they both like racehorses gambling and partying, and one writes a book on
[02:12:36.079 --> 02:12:38.561]  Virtues and the other plays the part of a crazy Democrat.
[02:12:39.001 --> 02:12:40.082]  It's all staged, folks.
[02:12:40.142 --> 02:12:41.123]  It's family business.
[02:12:41.863 --> 02:12:43.885]  Here she is saying it's the liberal media.
[02:12:44.105 --> 02:12:47.447]  You mean the media owned by the defense contractors that build the cluster bombs?
[02:12:48.148 --> 02:12:50.409]  That poses liberals to fool the idiot liberals?
[02:12:51.330 --> 02:12:51.871]  Here she is.
[02:12:52.451 --> 02:12:55.653]  Let me ask you about the economy, Mary Madeline, because look at this number.
[02:12:55.693 --> 02:12:58.755]  CNBC has a new poll coming out tomorrow, Wealth in America.
[02:12:59.036 --> 02:12:59.976]  They ask one question.
[02:13:00.237 --> 02:13:01.758]  The current state of the economy.
[02:13:02.278 --> 02:13:02.798]  Excellent or good, 16.
[02:13:03.579 --> 02:13:04.179]  Fair or poor, 83.
[02:13:06.164 --> 02:13:16.392]  In an election where the economy is central to people, and Republicans are actually asking, in effect, for a third term in the White House, what do those numbers mean to you?
[02:13:16.412 --> 02:13:24.699]  Well, there's an element of cognitive dissonance there, because if you ask them how their own personal finances are going, those numbers completely switch.
[02:13:25.039 --> 02:13:28.302]  But politically, there has not... Yes, you're looking around, that's completely true.
[02:13:28.322 --> 02:13:30.304]  They've absolutely switched.
[02:13:30.384 --> 02:13:31.565]  Stop right there.
[02:13:31.965 --> 02:13:32.886]  That is total bull.
[02:13:33.740 --> 02:13:34.701]  She just made that up.
[02:13:35.141 --> 02:13:36.302]  Notice there's no source, Kevin.
[02:13:37.443 --> 02:13:38.644]  Just total baloney.
[02:13:39.344 --> 02:13:41.546]  That lady's as conservative as Che Guevara.
[02:13:42.286 --> 02:13:42.767]  Back to her.
[02:13:43.287 --> 02:13:46.530]  Because they're berated with these sort of numbers.
[02:13:46.610 --> 02:13:50.473]  However, politically, we haven't had the contrast yet.
[02:13:50.593 --> 02:13:57.558]  People do not want, as a furtherance of economic policy, the kind of centralization that Obama and Hillary are proposing.
[02:13:57.598 --> 02:13:58.959]  They don't want more regulation.
[02:13:59.459 --> 02:14:00.320]  See, that's true.
[02:14:01.650 --> 02:14:03.472]  But the Republicans are going to give you that, too.
[02:14:03.572 --> 02:14:06.716]  See, so this is about creating the illusion that there's a choice.
[02:14:06.776 --> 02:14:14.444]  And nowhere does this illusion have a thinner veil than her right-by, her space-alien-looking husband, Carville.
[02:14:17.007 --> 02:14:21.953]  So then he comes in and admits the economy's bad, but then tells you the solution is centralization.
[02:14:23.323 --> 02:14:29.448]  And this is designed, people watching this, to go with Carvel and think, oh my God, I'm against these evil Republicans.
[02:14:29.928 --> 02:14:32.650]  I'm for letting the government take over my health care so they can take care of me.
[02:14:32.950 --> 02:14:34.451]  Yes, they can euthanize your butt.
[02:14:34.852 --> 02:14:35.332]  Back to it.
[02:14:36.798 --> 02:14:38.399]  They don't want higher taxes.
[02:14:38.599 --> 02:14:40.019]  They don't want less trade.
[02:14:40.079 --> 02:14:45.281]  Maybe, you know, there's a way to help the transition in Ohio and Pennsylvania in those manufacturing states.
[02:14:45.641 --> 02:14:55.584]  But when you start contrasting liberal, it's not liberal, liberal, liberal, just you redistributionist policies with limited government policies, the limited government... Stop right there.
[02:14:56.624 --> 02:14:59.645]  The Republicans and the Democrats both redistribute our wealth.
[02:14:59.685 --> 02:15:01.666]  They sell the Democrats on redistribution.
[02:15:02.649 --> 02:15:12.079]  To quote with the poor, but that really just is to micromanage, break up families, and run basic eugenics ops from their own founding, read their own documents, and then they give the money to corporations.
[02:15:12.580 --> 02:15:18.106]  Republicans just act like they don't and claim they're for free market while they take the money and give it to select corporations.
[02:15:20.829 --> 02:15:22.971]  Just finish playing the political prostitute.
[02:15:24.241 --> 02:15:25.702]  Economics wins every time.
[02:15:25.742 --> 02:15:26.723]  Isn't the economy stupid?
[02:15:26.763 --> 02:15:27.343]  Of course it is.
[02:15:27.603 --> 02:15:29.164]  And people are feeling it.
[02:15:29.204 --> 02:15:31.305]  This is not something created by the media.
[02:15:31.465 --> 02:15:40.831]  I mean, these mortgages at high energy costs, these pathetic employment numbers, the health care costs, food costs, they're just killing people out there.
[02:15:40.851 --> 02:15:43.012]  They're not being told that things are terrible.
[02:15:43.492 --> 02:15:45.013]  They are feeling this every day.
[02:15:46.074 --> 02:15:46.654]  Exactly.
[02:15:46.794 --> 02:15:52.718]  The media covered it all up as long as they could while you were just getting deeper into debt and they were telling you that was...
[02:15:54.289 --> 02:15:55.730]  A great prosperity.
[02:15:56.591 --> 02:15:58.632]  And just running up credit cards endlessly.
[02:16:00.413 --> 02:16:02.875]  We have to admit we've been living outside our means.
[02:16:03.416 --> 02:16:08.779]  If we would have not lived outside our means, we would have had greater wealth down the road.
[02:16:08.839 --> 02:16:15.064]  But we were taught somehow that credit cards are cute and you're getting away with something when you run up a credit card.
[02:16:15.084 --> 02:16:17.205]  I mean, it's really sick.
[02:16:17.226 --> 02:16:20.608]  I know a lot of people who are into credit cards and they just, it's sick.
[02:16:21.326 --> 02:16:22.607]  And they pay the minimum payment.
[02:16:22.727 --> 02:16:24.708]  A lot of them even have money to pay it off.
[02:16:25.508 --> 02:16:31.592]  But they think somehow in some mental way that having credit cards is like they're getting away with something.
[02:16:32.272 --> 02:16:35.554]  I got debit cards, folks, and I pay the suckers off each month.
[02:16:36.454 --> 02:16:39.276]  But again, I'm not out buying a bunch of extra crap.
[02:16:40.476 --> 02:16:41.097]  I never have.
[02:16:42.297 --> 02:16:45.799]  I mean, if it's my brothers, I wear a T-shirt with holes in it, blue jeans and tennis shoes.
[02:16:45.839 --> 02:16:50.682]  But when it comes to this operation, I dump it all right back in.
[02:16:51.826 --> 02:17:06.474]  That's another reason we've been more successful than other Patriot groups and other organizations is while 10 years ago people like me were buying a new car with money that came in off book sales or something, I was putting it into better cameras and better facilities and better computers.
[02:17:07.695 --> 02:17:10.436]  And it goes with the same thing for just the American people.
[02:17:12.757 --> 02:17:17.380]  But now they've dug a financial hole that we are not going to get out of.
[02:17:18.027 --> 02:17:19.348]  Without total bankruptcy.
[02:17:19.568 --> 02:17:24.250]  And then they're going to use the bankruptcy in the establishment to sell us on bondage because we, quote, owe it.
[02:17:24.550 --> 02:17:25.130]  We don't owe it.
[02:17:25.410 --> 02:17:26.691]  It's fiat crud.
[02:17:27.351 --> 02:17:28.752]  It needs to all be reset.
[02:17:29.232 --> 02:17:31.453]  We need to go back to constitutional money and the dollar.
[02:17:31.773 --> 02:17:37.496]  Instead, they're going to reset us into the Amero, into the Euro, into the new global pyramid currency.
[02:17:38.876 --> 02:17:39.597]  We're going to come back.
[02:17:39.697 --> 02:17:42.098]  Jam in calls quick from Christian, Mark, Steve, and Dan.
[02:17:42.318 --> 02:17:44.419]  Then a bunch more news and audio clips.
[02:17:44.499 --> 02:17:44.999]  Stay with me.
[02:17:46.690 --> 02:17:48.111]  It is a big idea.
[02:17:48.131 --> 02:17:50.233]  A new world order.
[02:17:50.954 --> 02:17:55.157]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:17:55.838 --> 02:17:57.599]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[02:17:58.660 --> 02:18:00.902]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:18:01.462 --> 02:18:03.925]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:18:04.645 --> 02:18:12.011]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:18:14.964 --> 02:18:19.945]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:18:20.445 --> 02:18:23.926]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:18:24.286 --> 02:18:26.807]  Bill Burr is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:18:26.847 --> 02:18:28.007]  Most people have no idea.
[02:18:28.027 --> 02:18:28.787]  They're not after money.
[02:18:28.807 --> 02:18:29.867]  They have all the money they need.
[02:18:30.087 --> 02:18:30.827]  They're after power.
[02:18:31.067 --> 02:18:31.768]  That's what happens.
[02:18:32.208 --> 02:18:40.409]  Order Endgame on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:18:40.549 --> 02:18:41.410]  Endgame.
[02:18:41.690 --> 02:18:43.290]  Home prep for global enslavement.
[02:18:43.710 --> 02:18:44.891]  You have been warned.
[02:18:47.231 --> 02:18:47.752]  Hi, neighbor.
[02:18:48.972 --> 02:18:50.693]  We all know that knowledge is power.
[02:18:51.133 --> 02:18:54.234]  We've tried to give you knowledge to help you prepare for rough times.
[02:18:54.834 --> 02:18:59.516]  There's the worldwide famine and our country's dependence on, often dangerous, food imports.
[02:19:00.156 --> 02:19:02.157]  You know about genetically poisoned food.
[02:19:02.677 --> 02:19:08.259]  Two-thirds of the food is disappearing with the bees along with huge crop failures from all-time record water shortages.
[02:19:08.980 --> 02:19:12.641]  You know they're turning food into fuel with corn ethanol plants.
[02:19:13.599 --> 02:19:17.301]  If we do not control our food, food will be used to control us.
[02:19:17.821 --> 02:19:22.964]  Food control has been the plan historically in every enslaved population and is the plan for America.
[02:19:23.644 --> 02:19:31.908]  The only value of the knowledge you have to take control of your food is if you choose to get a supply while you still have the freedom to choose.
[02:19:32.368 --> 02:19:33.949]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com Call 800-409-5633
[02:19:46.215 --> 02:19:58.958]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in Internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[02:19:59.358 --> 02:20:06.080]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[02:20:06.440 --> 02:20:06.880]  We're good to go.
[02:20:37.341 --> 02:20:39.623]  We're in a no-holds-barred information war.
[02:20:40.004 --> 02:20:45.309]  Truth is our weapon, and prisonplanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[02:20:46.252 --> 02:20:49.175]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:20:49.335 --> 02:20:54.520]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:20:54.860 --> 02:21:00.185]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:21:00.585 --> 02:21:01.706]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:21:02.067 --> 02:21:11.055]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[02:21:13.217 --> 02:21:22.067]  All natural, earth-friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing, they're safe, and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[02:21:22.448 --> 02:21:24.790]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[02:21:26.272 --> 02:21:27.033]  Keep it natural.
[02:21:27.353 --> 02:21:35.517]  Call Calvin Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com.
[02:21:35.758 --> 02:21:41.261]  Try Calvin Pure Soaps and I'll bet you'll never use any other cleaning products again.
[02:21:41.821 --> 02:21:44.903]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[02:21:47.084 --> 02:21:49.826]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:21:49.846 --> 02:21:53.668]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:56.195 --> 02:21:58.017]  Coming up, I'm going to give you my take on 2012.
[02:21:58.377 --> 02:21:59.918]  People keep asking me ad nauseum.
[02:21:59.978 --> 02:22:00.539]  I'm going to do it.
[02:22:01.560 --> 02:22:05.343]  And my comments on really what we truly face as a society.
[02:22:06.564 --> 02:22:07.384]  Counting the cost.
[02:22:07.464 --> 02:22:08.705]  A message really to the elite.
[02:22:09.746 --> 02:22:11.347]  Christian in Wisconsin.
[02:22:11.748 --> 02:22:12.428]  You're on the air.
[02:22:12.468 --> 02:22:13.149]  Thanks for holding.
[02:22:14.030 --> 02:22:14.910]  All right, Alex.
[02:22:14.990 --> 02:22:16.272]  Hey, it's great to talk to you.
[02:22:16.312 --> 02:22:19.054]  And I just want to say thank you for doing what you're doing.
[02:22:19.374 --> 02:22:20.055]  Well, thank you.
[02:22:20.095 --> 02:22:20.415]  Go ahead.
[02:22:20.959 --> 02:22:22.119]  I got a lot of stuff to get to.
[02:22:22.139 --> 02:22:26.781]  I got some notes here, so if I bounce a little bit, you're going to have to excuse me on that.
[02:22:27.621 --> 02:22:36.704]  Ten years ago, I got into this freedom movement, actually, and it was just, I really kind of felt pretty much alone in it and didn't know there was a lot of other people in it.
[02:22:37.905 --> 02:22:47.268]  And recently, you know, a few months ago, and I heard about Ron Paul was running for office, and I heard his message, and I was truly shocked by it, that somebody in
[02:22:48.027 --> 02:22:51.768]  In the mainstream of politics would actually bring up these types of issues.
[02:22:51.788 --> 02:22:56.849]  Well, let me just add a key point here, since you brought it up, and let me think of it before I forget, and then I'll stop interrupting.
[02:22:56.869 --> 02:23:04.050]  A lot of people think Ron Paul and the Ron Paul revolution somehow created all these people, and it did.
[02:23:04.070 --> 02:23:09.311]  It created, you know, it woke up a lot of people, but most of the people were already there.
[02:23:09.411 --> 02:23:12.271]  It was a focal point to bring us together.
[02:23:12.971 --> 02:23:17.272]  And then, through that synergy, then our numbers basically doubled.
[02:23:17.814 --> 02:23:19.715]  And so it's such a beautiful thing that's happened.
[02:23:19.735 --> 02:23:20.075]  Go ahead.
[02:23:20.355 --> 02:23:20.855]  Yes, it is.
[02:23:20.895 --> 02:23:21.456]  Yes, it is.
[02:23:22.356 --> 02:23:29.519]  So anyway, I was encouraged by it, and obviously that energized me even more to work in the freedom movement.
[02:23:29.619 --> 02:23:32.160]  And so I started visiting.
[02:23:32.360 --> 02:23:40.224]  There's this one chat site over at Ron Paul Radio, and I used to hang out in the chat a lot, and I learned a lot of really good information.
[02:23:41.028 --> 02:23:44.590]  And that information really had a shelf life of about 10 seconds.
[02:23:44.751 --> 02:23:56.378]  You know, like a link for whatever website would just get posted and it would zap through the chat and then, you know, unless somebody else posted it, you wouldn't really hear about the information again.
[02:23:56.418 --> 02:24:05.924]  So what I decided to do is I started a website that also had a chat on it and basically all the good information that would come through the chat room I would post on the website.
[02:24:06.304 --> 02:24:08.226]  So the website just got bigger and bigger and bigger.
[02:24:08.266 --> 02:24:09.967]  Go ahead and plug it, sir, and I've got to move on.
[02:24:09.987 --> 02:24:10.067]  Sure.
[02:24:10.447 --> 02:24:10.627]  Sure.
[02:24:10.707 --> 02:24:13.008]  It's ronpaulchat.net.
[02:24:13.328 --> 02:24:13.868]  Good.
[02:24:14.148 --> 02:24:18.949]  And then what happened is we actually had a Java applet on there.
[02:24:19.029 --> 02:24:26.370]  And then what happened with that is people would migrate to an IRC client and then never visit the website anymore.
[02:24:26.430 --> 02:24:28.291]  And people would ask about this or that issue.
[02:24:28.371 --> 02:24:31.732]  And I'd say, well, I've had the link up there for like the past month.
[02:24:31.772 --> 02:24:33.152]  And they're, oh, I didn't even know about it.
[02:24:33.212 --> 02:24:38.233]  So myself and a couple other investors got into this programming.
[02:24:38.689 --> 02:24:47.917]  And we decided to build a web-based chat network, and it's called TalkSuites.com, as in apartments.
[02:24:47.957 --> 02:24:50.299]  Very exciting, sir, and send me some info.
[02:24:50.319 --> 02:24:51.780]  I might have you as a guest or something.
[02:24:51.800 --> 02:24:53.061]  I can't just go on and on.
[02:24:53.081 --> 02:24:54.582]  I'm not going to have time to get to these other callers.
[02:24:55.403 --> 02:24:56.824]  Mark in Atlanta, you're on the air.
[02:24:56.864 --> 02:24:57.304]  Go ahead.
[02:24:58.946 --> 02:25:00.687]  Hey, you can hear me better this time, huh?
[02:25:00.867 --> 02:25:01.548]  Yes, I can, sir.
[02:25:01.568 --> 02:25:01.968]  Go ahead.
[02:25:02.629 --> 02:25:05.591]  Yes, blessings upon you, your reverend, our prayers.
[02:25:06.392 --> 02:25:06.612]  Okay.
[02:25:07.150 --> 02:25:13.035]  The term economics comes from the Greek oikonomos, which means the house of law.
[02:25:13.996 --> 02:25:34.734]  When I studied economics in college, they taught us about the multiplier effect, where the reserve requirement, which was traditionally 10%, being an inverse relationship, basically resulted that the Fed would get the ball rolling by creating, say, $10 billion, and with a 10% reserve requirement, through the way the system works, is basically the
[02:25:35.276 --> 02:25:40.258]  The subsequent subordinate banks would create an additional $90 billion.
[02:25:40.518 --> 02:25:44.420]  And then they create more banks and then leverage it out over and over again.
[02:25:44.600 --> 02:25:50.343]  But that wasn't enough, so in 1993 they changed the rules to just basically unlimited insane land.
[02:25:51.083 --> 02:25:51.343]  Right.
[02:25:51.503 --> 02:25:56.746]  A friend of mine who's a financial analyst said that now the reserve requirement is less than 1%.
[02:25:56.906 --> 02:26:04.169]  Now, I won't go into the mathematical abstractions because it would take a bit and it's
[02:26:04.898 --> 02:26:09.383]  The thing is that... Well, it's infinity.
[02:26:09.423 --> 02:26:18.213]  It's infinity because, again, they can have a bank that's leveraged out ten times and then it can create subsidiaries and leverage out.
[02:26:18.954 --> 02:26:24.380]  Well, that's why my folks are with me about creating a victory garden out in the country and...
[02:26:27.689 --> 02:26:32.371]  You heard me mention this some time ago, the writer with the scales who calls out a denarius for a loaf of bread.
[02:26:32.591 --> 02:26:34.732]  I desperately pray I'm wrong about this.
[02:26:34.972 --> 02:26:41.095]  Well, I'll tell you what's happening is that's why they've got the new, oh, you want you to have your cow in the 4-H club?
[02:26:41.616 --> 02:26:44.537]  Well, your kid's got to sign your property over to be registered.
[02:26:44.557 --> 02:26:49.219]  And when you sign that, you're really signing your land over to federal regulation forever through contract.
[02:26:49.680 --> 02:26:51.701]  So it's the Premonent Society, Animal ID.
[02:26:52.481 --> 02:27:02.065]  And that's why they'll have bureaucrats, and now the Bureau of Land Management, the local county guys, they've all got machine guns, black masks, armored vehicles.
[02:27:02.445 --> 02:27:08.447]  It's all about total death and destruction against us, and the idiots that are part of it don't even see the bigger picture.
[02:27:08.467 --> 02:27:09.107]  I've got to jump.
[02:27:09.627 --> 02:27:20.071]  Again, I gave Christian like three minutes to tell us about websites, and Mark was bringing up really great points, but then I won't be able to get to Steve, Dan, Rachel, and others, or Rochelle, if we don't move on here.
[02:27:20.091 --> 02:27:21.672]  I've got a lot of other ground to cover.
[02:27:23.448 --> 02:27:26.051]  Always great hearing your calls, the different directions you take us in.
[02:27:26.071 --> 02:27:26.672]  Yeah, I'm not kidding.
[02:27:26.692 --> 02:27:29.155]  They're just militarizing every group against us.
[02:27:29.215 --> 02:27:30.757]  The government's gearing up for war.
[02:27:31.237 --> 02:27:32.479]  This is their plan.
[02:27:32.519 --> 02:27:33.820]  They hate you and your family.
[02:27:36.564 --> 02:27:37.465]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.965 --> 02:27:39.567]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.488 --> 02:27:43.192]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.474 --> 02:27:54.878]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on Earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[02:27:55.178 --> 02:28:00.260]  At HempUSA.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the U.S.
[02:28:00.300 --> 02:28:00.861]  and Canada.
[02:28:01.161 --> 02:28:07.704]  At HempUSA.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[02:28:08.264 --> 02:28:11.546]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[02:28:11.666 --> 02:28:13.887]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.
[02:28:14.107 --> 02:28:20.470]  This nutrient-dense food can be stored up to five years when vacuum-packed and is priced affordably to be used as a storable food.
[02:28:20.710 --> 02:28:24.012]  HempUSA.org is a bulk shipper starting with five pounds and up.
[02:28:24.232 --> 02:28:30.896]  To allow this food to work for you, call 908-691-2608 or go to HempUSA.org and order today.
[02:28:31.276 --> 02:28:34.237]  The body will react and heal itself given the proper nutrition.
[02:28:34.437 --> 02:28:37.559]  This superfood will be your greatest asset, so try it today.
[02:28:37.999 --> 02:28:38.580]  We're good to go.
[02:29:04.480 --> 02:29:05.120]  We're good to go.
[02:29:05.220 --> 02:29:05.860]  We're good to go.
[02:29:31.628 --> 02:29:32.770]  or call Dr. William Diegel at 888-212-8871 888-212-8871
[02:29:46.494 --> 02:29:48.315]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:29:48.475 --> 02:29:55.159]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:29:55.419 --> 02:30:03.604]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:30:03.824 --> 02:30:09.547]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:30:09.727 --> 02:30:11.487]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:30:11.568 --> 02:30:13.688]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:30:28.763 --> 02:30:29.283]  We're good to go.
[02:31:03.308 --> 02:31:04.328]  We're back live.
[02:31:04.388 --> 02:31:10.530]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:31:11.351 --> 02:31:14.072]  Ladies and gentlemen, you have found it.
[02:31:18.213 --> 02:31:20.194]  The tip of the spear in the info war.
[02:31:21.074 --> 02:31:21.794]  The front lines.
[02:31:28.229 --> 02:31:33.471]  Mortal Kombat, toe-to-toe with the NWO!
[02:31:33.511 --> 02:31:34.311]  Yeah!
[02:31:35.051 --> 02:31:40.052]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:31:40.112 --> 02:31:44.854]  Look, I'm going to try to get to Steve, Dan, Rochelle, and others, but that'll be it for calls.
[02:32:01.730 --> 02:32:04.552]  But I have a lot of news and information that needs to be covered.
[02:32:09.796 --> 02:32:10.797]  So much going on.
[02:32:14.319 --> 02:32:15.440]  I do want to say this.
[02:32:16.501 --> 02:32:30.531]  Infowars.com has just exploded since we set it up for people to comment in all the stories and set up your own MySpace accounts where you can have your own base of operations on Infowars.com, your own area.
[02:32:31.337 --> 02:32:31.878]  We're good to go.
[02:32:45.859 --> 02:32:52.343]  And then you're welcome to go in and post your own stories as comments onto bigger articles and then link back to your subpage.
[02:32:52.363 --> 02:32:53.423]  That's what we want you to do.
[02:32:53.763 --> 02:32:55.264]  We want you to take advantage of this.
[02:32:55.304 --> 02:32:56.365]  We want you to use it.
[02:32:56.625 --> 02:33:03.269]  We want you to write articles on your own subpage, go out and post it elsewhere, send people back there to build your page, build InfoWars.
[02:33:03.989 --> 02:33:10.813]  We're going to be redesigning Prison Planet in the next few months and launching it in the same type format but with some added bells and whistles.
[02:33:10.833 --> 02:33:14.115]  We've just secured another content distribution network
[02:33:14.910 --> 02:33:21.094]  So we've now got about, I don't know, I'm told about 175 to 200 terabytes.
[02:33:21.815 --> 02:33:24.677]  We're only using about 50 terabytes a month right now.
[02:33:24.737 --> 02:33:32.562]  As you can tell, we're gearing up with 200 terabytes to really take it to the New World Order.
[02:33:33.003 --> 02:33:35.945]  For folks who don't know, that's a lot of bandwidth, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:36.545 --> 02:33:42.169]  We're going to be putting prisonplanet.tv videos out in high def for members.
[02:33:42.529 --> 02:33:42.970]  Oh, yes.
[02:33:44.244 --> 02:33:46.006]  You're going to have to have a mega connection for that.
[02:33:46.026 --> 02:33:47.487]  It's still going to be in all the other formats.
[02:33:48.208 --> 02:33:48.568]  You know what?
[02:33:50.169 --> 02:33:50.610]  The talk.
[02:33:51.991 --> 02:33:54.954]  We talk here, but we talk about the action we take, and then we take that action.
[02:33:55.894 --> 02:33:57.436]  And we're hooking people up together.
[02:33:57.476 --> 02:33:58.177]  We're moving forward.
[02:33:58.197 --> 02:33:59.338]  We're fighting the New World Order.
[02:34:00.018 --> 02:34:05.543]  A lot of people talk about what they're going to do against the New World Order and talk about a bunch of big plans and never build it.
[02:34:06.304 --> 02:34:07.345]  We say we're doing something.
[02:34:07.365 --> 02:34:08.626]  You better believe we're going to do it.
[02:34:09.130 --> 02:34:13.053]  If I've got to be banging my bloody head up against the wall, we're going to make sure that happens.
[02:34:13.093 --> 02:34:15.915]  If I've got to not sleep, we're going to make sure that happens.
[02:34:17.796 --> 02:34:18.537]  And it's you.
[02:34:18.677 --> 02:34:30.225]  We have Digg shutting us down, censoring us, MySpace, all these other sites, all those universities, libraries, corporations, blocking us out when people think they're buying some software to block out evil stuff.
[02:34:30.245 --> 02:34:33.227]  They're really blocking out my site and a bunch of other Patriot sites.
[02:34:33.999 --> 02:34:34.980]  That means we're hurting them.
[02:34:35.100 --> 02:34:42.547]  So just take our URLs, take our stories, and just keep ramming it down their throat, and never giving up and never giving in.
[02:34:43.968 --> 02:35:00.283]  Because the costs are too high, and we're reaching more people than ever, and that's because of you spreading the word about truthnews.us, infowars.net, prisonplanet.com, infowars.com, prisonplanet.tv, jonesreport.com, arnoldexposed.com,
[02:35:01.371 --> 02:35:16.109]  RonPaulWarRoom.com MartialLaw911.info WhatIsTheEndGame.com LooseChangeTheFinalCut.com And they're all big sites, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35:16.149 --> 02:35:18.031]  Some of them are gargantuan.
[02:35:19.022 --> 02:35:20.322]  And that is because of you.
[02:35:20.462 --> 02:35:25.284]  And we took every hack and every attack and everything that happened to us, and we always started a new site.
[02:35:25.784 --> 02:35:27.344]  I'm retiring that policy now.
[02:35:27.384 --> 02:35:29.105]  We're just going to build up all the sites we've got.
[02:35:29.465 --> 02:35:35.766]  Well, I will be starting some new ones, but those will be just per films and per projects, you know, small sites.
[02:35:36.747 --> 02:35:39.527]  But, you know, no more big juggernauts for now.
[02:35:39.567 --> 02:35:45.269]  We're just going to build up these titans that we have and use them effectively against the enemy.
[02:35:45.985 --> 02:35:48.506]  And literally, it's you that powers us up.
[02:35:48.866 --> 02:35:57.248]  It's all of us together, rising in cyberspace, and then it leaks into the real world to great effect.
[02:36:00.269 --> 02:36:06.931]  There were a bunch of big Republican and Democratic politicians at KLBJ, News Radio 590, to do Beyond the Beltway last night.
[02:36:06.951 --> 02:36:07.731]  They were doing it locally.
[02:36:07.911 --> 02:36:08.631]  Big syndicated show.
[02:36:10.723 --> 02:36:17.607]  They were quite a few bigwigs there, and I knew a bunch of them years ago, like Kirk Watson, Senator, and former Mayor of Austin, and a bunch of others.
[02:36:18.208 --> 02:36:26.673]  And used to, they'd laugh at me and whatever, but then they saw me, they were scared to death of me, and coming up, wanting to shake my hand and say, Hi, Alex, keep up the good work.
[02:36:27.073 --> 02:36:29.194]  See, that's how it works, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:36:29.234 --> 02:36:30.455]  You start having an effect.
[02:36:30.935 --> 02:36:31.856]  These people know.
[02:36:32.974 --> 02:36:35.755]  Ten years ago, they knew they had everybody bought into their scam.
[02:36:36.035 --> 02:36:38.416]  Ten years ago, they thought that, boy, they had it all.
[02:36:38.716 --> 02:36:43.938]  Now they know everybody hates them, everybody knows what they are, and the jig is up for them.
[02:36:46.379 --> 02:36:50.801]  Obama's going to fool people for a little while, but they'll wake up to him even faster than they did against Bush.
[02:36:51.781 --> 02:36:54.662]  Sure, Obama's intelligent, good-looking, dynamic, has charisma.
[02:36:54.682 --> 02:36:55.663]  Bush has none of that.
[02:36:57.564 --> 02:37:00.125]  And I've got to say, it looks like I was wrong.
[02:37:00.145 --> 02:37:01.125]  We'll find out tomorrow.
[02:37:01.963 --> 02:37:12.190]  I kept saying Hillary Clinton because the Republicans and Democrats were behind her, but I think they just refused her, so they're giving us Obama to, quote, bring the country together, quote, bring us back to believing the government scams.
[02:37:15.693 --> 02:37:21.657]  You know, Obama's got charisma, but the people running him and his policies are pure evil.
[02:37:22.638 --> 02:37:28.222]  I mean, we played Walter Cronkite talking about how he wants world government and how he stands lovingly next to Satan.
[02:37:29.031 --> 02:37:31.873]  I mean, these people... I know that sounds crazy to new listeners.
[02:37:32.153 --> 02:37:32.773]  Have you seen it?
[02:37:32.813 --> 02:37:34.794]  It's video Walter Cronkite saying it.
[02:37:35.074 --> 02:37:38.136]  You can't make this stuff up.
[02:37:38.636 --> 02:37:42.819]  Who would make up that you'd have an elite that puts poison in the water to brain damage everybody?
[02:37:43.819 --> 02:37:45.440]  Well, they say to make us more easily managed.
[02:37:45.720 --> 02:37:47.361]  They're in control because they're cold-blooded.
[02:37:48.001 --> 02:37:49.542]  You don't need to be cold-blooded.
[02:37:49.782 --> 02:37:51.283]  Just stop being idiots.
[02:37:52.084 --> 02:37:54.285]  Stop being scammed every five minutes.
[02:37:57.136 --> 02:37:59.197]  Look, I want to think about what I'm going to say because it's important.
[02:38:01.337 --> 02:38:04.378]  And we're not going to have time now to take calls.
[02:38:04.418 --> 02:38:05.258]  I apologize, everybody.
[02:38:05.658 --> 02:38:07.639]  The callers that are holding, you call back tomorrow, I'll get to you.
[02:38:07.659 --> 02:38:08.299]  I got to a lot.
[02:38:08.879 --> 02:38:10.640]  I want to play this History Channel piece about 2012.
[02:38:10.780 --> 02:38:13.760]  Now, I think this is a bunch of bunk.
[02:38:14.641 --> 02:38:17.561]  I'm not talking about 2012 itself, but the type of stuff you hear on this newscast.
[02:38:17.581 --> 02:38:22.743]  I'm going to play most of it and then comment on it and then give my challenge to everybody, including the elite.
[02:38:22.983 --> 02:38:23.343]  Here it is.
[02:38:25.925 --> 02:38:29.367]  It is a doomsday that is foretold in the Mayan calendar.
[02:38:30.427 --> 02:38:32.568]  The Chinese Oracle of I Ching.
[02:38:33.629 --> 02:38:38.131]  Even an internet-based prophetic software program.
[02:38:38.151 --> 02:38:38.131]  2012.
[02:38:38.591 --> 02:38:44.213]  A date that is prophesied as the end of the world.
[02:38:45.854 --> 02:38:48.715]  But is there any science behind this dire prediction?
[02:38:49.616 --> 02:38:52.277]  Could ancient oracles truly predict the future?
[02:38:53.394 --> 02:39:10.129]  The answer could affect us all, because history shows a surprisingly good track record for those who say Doomsday is almost here.
[02:39:12.171 --> 02:39:15.413]  There are wars and rumors of war.
[02:39:16.454 --> 02:39:18.977]  Signs and warnings.
[02:39:20.578 --> 02:39:22.119]  There are disasters.
[02:39:23.060 --> 02:39:23.660]  Destruction.
[02:39:25.921 --> 02:39:32.505]  There are those who say that these are dark times, and that these destructive events are not just random.
[02:39:33.346 --> 02:39:42.572]  So if you turn on Fox or CNN news, you're constantly seeing possibilities of terrorism, nuclear attacks, plagues of new diseases.
[02:39:43.012 --> 02:39:45.694]  We seem to be going through an apocalyptic process.
[02:39:48.562 --> 02:40:01.527]  These days were prophesied long ago in the pages of the Bible, the temples of ancient Rome, the pyramids of the ancient Maya, even the World Wide Web.
[02:40:02.888 --> 02:40:09.051]  We have a number of prophecies that all seem to imply that something is going to happen in the 21st century.
[02:40:11.315 --> 02:40:23.166]  It ties into a number of prophecies made in the Old Testament, these warnings of coming judgment, of a coming doomsday because people are not following the rules of the law.
[02:40:24.367 --> 02:40:31.153]  More than one oracle in history points to a single date, a disastrous convergence not far in the future.
[02:40:31.834 --> 02:40:34.497]  The Mayans talked about December 21st, 2012 as being the end of this cycle.
[02:40:38.473 --> 02:40:47.440]  The ancient Mayans of Central America created a calendar so precise that it could predict lunar eclipses literally thousands of years in the future.
[02:40:48.221 --> 02:40:51.684]  Yet the Mayan calendar mysteriously ends on one date.
[02:40:52.684 --> 02:40:54.666]  The winter solstice in the year 2012.
[02:40:54.706 --> 02:41:03.153]  Is the world going to end in 2012 or is there going to be some kind of major shift in cycles of history?
[02:41:04.019 --> 02:41:05.360]  That remains an open question.
[02:41:06.261 --> 02:41:11.946]  And the newest version of the 2012 doomsday prophecy comes from an oracle that isn't even human.
[02:41:12.967 --> 02:41:15.669]  Its inventors call it the Web Bot Project.
[02:41:17.231 --> 02:41:22.215]  It began in the late 1990s as a program to predict possible stock futures.
[02:41:23.016 --> 02:41:28.921]  Anytime anybody makes an investment, they're at the same time making a prediction about the future.
[02:41:29.875 --> 02:41:42.328]  Business consultant George Yor worked with partners and developed a program that uses independent mini-programs called spiders or agents to comb the internet for hints of future financial news.
[02:41:44.050 --> 02:41:51.358]  The concept behind the web bots is that massive scans of language will reveal a direct connection to the collective unconscious.
[02:41:52.248 --> 02:41:53.668]  And a hint of the future.
[02:41:54.169 --> 02:41:59.110]  It's almost a window into the universal subconscious mind.
[02:42:00.150 --> 02:42:03.712]  However it works, the WebBot's track record is impressive.
[02:42:04.892 --> 02:42:09.513]  August 2004, we made a prediction about earthquakes.
[02:42:10.494 --> 02:42:17.036]  We predicted 300,000 dead, the water rising, which turned out to be the tsunami in December of 2004.
[02:42:19.424 --> 02:42:23.846]  The web bots also foretold the anthrax attacks in Washington DC in 2001.
[02:42:24.086 --> 02:42:27.808]  The massive East Coast power outage of 2003.
[02:42:28.028 --> 02:42:32.129]  The destruction of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
[02:42:34.068 --> 02:42:37.710]  But it's the WebBots prophecies for the future that are most disturbing.
[02:42:38.270 --> 02:42:48.435]  If the WebBots are correct, then we should see a series of escalations leading to, I don't like to say it, but something like limited nuclear war in 2008-2009 kind of time frame.
[02:42:56.851 --> 02:43:01.674]  According to the web bots, a series of catastrophes reaches its peak in the year 2012.
[02:43:01.714 --> 02:43:05.376]  I honestly don't know what's going to happen in 2012.
[02:43:05.416 --> 02:43:14.100]  This technology may start meshing with a lot of the other predictive things out there, like Mayan calendar.
[02:43:16.382 --> 02:43:20.884]  Okay, so tomorrow we'll play more of that for you.
[02:43:23.911 --> 02:43:24.872]  I wrote a lot of notes on this.
[02:43:24.892 --> 02:43:27.733]  I'll have to do part two tomorrow, but I'm going to get into this a little bit now.
[02:43:28.694 --> 02:43:34.277]  Number one, there is a lot of baloney mixed in with things that we've confirmed to be true.
[02:43:36.118 --> 02:43:47.824]  The predictive web bot system is the same thing the NSA does, not just in computer cyberspace, but with your phone calls, the radio transmissions, faxes, emails.
[02:43:48.244 --> 02:43:51.526]  With keyword software for decades, it tracks and collates and then
[02:43:52.924 --> 02:43:53.325]  We're good to go.
[02:44:16.858 --> 02:44:17.899]  We're good to go.
[02:44:45.914 --> 02:44:56.056]  They have much more powerful predictive systems to understand societal movements and predictive computer algorithms to literally predict the future.
[02:44:56.436 --> 02:45:03.658]  And Isaac Asimov, a true visionary, wrote books 55, 60 years ago predicting all of that.
[02:45:04.298 --> 02:45:13.600]  And see, whatever a futurist, it's like Arthur C. Clarke, you know, was 18 years old and invented the communications satellite.
[02:45:14.119 --> 02:45:17.641]  He wrote it up, drew it up as a science fiction writer, and he's patented with that.
[02:45:18.081 --> 02:45:19.321]  The Russians picked it up and did it.
[02:45:19.761 --> 02:45:21.902]  It's whatever you can envision.
[02:45:22.883 --> 02:45:29.226]  Like Jimmy Stewart made billions of dollars, not off of movies, but he invented offshore drilling.
[02:45:29.306 --> 02:45:31.246]  He came up with the ideas and the plans.
[02:45:31.847 --> 02:45:33.747]  You see, we are made in the image of God.
[02:45:33.807 --> 02:45:39.510]  Whatever we literally think about and try to manifest and try to build, we can then create.
[02:45:40.541 --> 02:45:41.882]  See, made in the image of a creator.
[02:45:42.342 --> 02:45:45.384]  Even if you don't believe in God, you can't deny that that's what we are.
[02:45:45.424 --> 02:45:46.084]  We are creators.
[02:45:46.304 --> 02:45:47.585]  We're an incredible species.
[02:45:48.265 --> 02:45:49.066]  We're amazing.
[02:45:52.168 --> 02:45:58.091]  Now, we have the scientific dictatorship who themselves are all into the occult.
[02:45:59.384 --> 02:46:11.410]  And so they do believe 2012 is a great consciousness shift, and they want to suppress the consciousness to keep the... They know a great change is coming, a new age.
[02:46:12.463 --> 02:46:19.365]  Kind of like in Lord of the Rings, they incorporate that where Saruman, the once good wizard, tells Gandalf, I am now of the many colors.
[02:46:19.485 --> 02:46:21.885]  I am combining my forces with Mordor.
[02:46:21.925 --> 02:46:22.686]  And he goes, why?
[02:46:22.706 --> 02:46:26.406]  And he goes, that new age is upon us and I must be in control of it.
[02:46:26.807 --> 02:46:28.287]  Well, that's what the New World Order says.
[02:46:28.327 --> 02:46:29.467]  They really believe all this.
[02:46:29.647 --> 02:46:34.949]  See, whether you believe in the new age or the galaxies aligning or any of this, that doesn't matter.
[02:46:35.769 --> 02:46:37.109]  See, I scientifically look at it.
[02:46:37.509 --> 02:46:38.509]  They believe in it.
[02:46:38.769 --> 02:46:40.770]  The elites are obsessed with it.
[02:46:41.906 --> 02:46:48.111]  So they're positioning to dominate and control whatever they believe is coming in 2012.
[02:46:50.173 --> 02:46:50.513]  Okay?
[02:46:51.554 --> 02:46:56.778]  They are positioning to dominate those changes that will develop.
[02:46:57.719 --> 02:47:02.843]  Whether it's real or not, the group consciousness now believes these changes are happening.
[02:47:03.103 --> 02:47:07.847]  The media is feeding back into that in a feedback loop, and so it is manifesting.
[02:47:08.740 --> 02:47:11.202]  Plus you have 9 billion people by 2012.
[02:47:11.742 --> 02:47:19.529]  You have the globalists staging terror, staging bioweapons, saying they want to use race-specific bioweapons.
[02:47:19.869 --> 02:47:23.452]  And I believe they may, and probably are, going to use this as a cover.
[02:47:24.116 --> 02:47:35.686]  For kind of global calamities, global freak-outs, global riots, global famines, to then usher in a global government to, quote, deal with those problems.
[02:47:35.726 --> 02:47:38.388]  And that's actually what they say they're going to do.
[02:47:38.448 --> 02:47:43.573]  That's why they control, not all of it, but the top of the New Age movement, the Christian movements, all of them.
[02:47:43.853 --> 02:47:50.739]  The show also said that all the oracles had said this, from the Roman temples to Saturn to the Christians to the Aztecs.
[02:47:52.046 --> 02:47:56.470]  No, actually, the Romans were very vague about all this.
[02:47:57.190 --> 02:48:00.313]  So was Nostradamus hundreds of, you know, thousands of years later.
[02:48:01.034 --> 02:48:02.175]  Very vague stuff.
[02:48:03.256 --> 02:48:05.638]  Now, the Christians were not vague.
[02:48:05.698 --> 02:48:06.979]  The Bible is not vague.
[02:48:07.419 --> 02:48:10.942]  And I have to be honest, neither were the Mayans and the Aztecs.
[02:48:11.022 --> 02:48:12.563]  It's pretty specific.
[02:48:13.224 --> 02:48:14.905]  And I'm just reporting to you the facts here.
[02:48:15.406 --> 02:48:19.069]  So they kind of mix in that Roman stuff when it was just a bunch of baloney.
[02:48:20.301 --> 02:48:23.122]  The Mayans were really tapped into something, and it was bad, by the way.
[02:48:23.162 --> 02:48:23.782]  It wasn't good.
[02:48:23.802 --> 02:48:25.482]  I can guarantee that.
[02:48:26.682 --> 02:48:30.883]  Blood drinking, killing their own children, this was some hardcore stuff, but they were geniuses.
[02:48:32.123 --> 02:48:34.524]  They took science to levels that are just unbelievable.
[02:48:35.284 --> 02:48:38.084]  We will be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:38.584 --> 02:48:41.905]  My challenge to the global elite, and everybody else for that matter, stay with us.
[02:48:46.966 --> 02:48:48.286]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:49.452 --> 02:48:52.154]  A new world order in the near future.
[02:48:53.035 --> 02:48:55.476]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:48:56.097 --> 02:48:57.878]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[02:48:58.919 --> 02:49:01.180]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:49:01.720 --> 02:49:04.162]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:49:04.903 --> 02:49:12.248]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:15.237 --> 02:49:20.220]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:20.701 --> 02:49:24.163]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:24.563 --> 02:49:27.065]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world of government.
[02:49:27.125 --> 02:49:28.086]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:28.106 --> 02:49:29.066]  They're not after money.
[02:49:29.086 --> 02:49:30.147]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:30.347 --> 02:49:31.068]  They're after power.
[02:49:31.328 --> 02:49:32.188]  That's why they have to use it.
[02:49:32.489 --> 02:49:40.674]  Order Endgame on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:49:40.814 --> 02:49:41.695]  Endgame.
[02:49:41.855 --> 02:49:43.836]  Home prep for global enslavement.
[02:49:43.996 --> 02:49:45.037]  You have been warned.
[02:49:45.077 --> 02:49:46.117]  We're good to go.
[02:49:46.137 --> 02:49:46.938]  We're good to go.
[02:50:00.964 --> 02:50:01.644]  We're good to go.
[02:50:20.538 --> 02:50:20.978]  We're good to go.
[02:50:20.998 --> 02:50:21.138]  I think?
[02:50:46.112 --> 02:50:53.077]  When my son started having behavior problems, the total transformation techniques were like the instruction manual on how to deal with him.
[02:50:53.317 --> 02:50:54.558]  We got immediate results.
[02:50:54.898 --> 02:50:59.622]  Ever wish your kid came with an instruction manual when he's disrespectful, defiant, or even abusive?
[02:50:59.902 --> 02:51:00.703]  Do you know how to fix it?
[02:51:01.123 --> 02:51:06.487]  I'm behavioral therapist James Lehman, and I'll show you how to change your child's behavior right now with the total transformation.
[02:51:06.787 --> 02:51:09.869]  The program that helps you fix every behavior problem under the sun.
[02:51:10.229 --> 02:51:15.232]  Defiance, backtalking, lying, acting out in school, even problems with ADD and ADHD.
[02:51:15.452 --> 02:51:18.214]  There's no screaming, no fighting, no frustration.
[02:51:18.514 --> 02:51:23.457]  The Total Transformation is the program I've used for over 30 years to solve even the worst behavior problems.
[02:51:23.797 --> 02:51:27.538]  Your child will listen to you again and you'll get peace and sanity back into your home.
[02:51:27.858 --> 02:51:28.498]  I guarantee it.
[02:51:28.898 --> 02:51:33.139]  Call now and get how to turn your child's attitude around in one minute or less free with your order.
[02:51:33.159 --> 02:51:33.619]  1-800-373-0402 1-800-373-0402 Call now.
[02:51:33.639 --> 02:51:33.779]  1-800-373-0402 1-800-373-0402
[02:51:57.767 --> 02:52:00.409]  The global elite are great managers.
[02:52:00.449 --> 02:52:01.830]  They do dominate the population.
[02:52:01.850 --> 02:52:02.971]  They control the currency.
[02:52:03.011 --> 02:52:05.433]  They control energy, raw resources.
[02:52:07.114 --> 02:52:08.615]  They believe they're stewards of the earth.
[02:52:08.655 --> 02:52:13.199]  They have to create world government to then forcibly reduce world population by 80% or more.
[02:52:13.900 --> 02:52:15.701]  It's a control freak's dream.
[02:52:16.322 --> 02:52:19.264]  But if you actually study what the elite do, they're poisoning the earth.
[02:52:19.324 --> 02:52:20.405]  They're cheating each other.
[02:52:20.465 --> 02:52:21.726]  They're cheating everybody else.
[02:52:22.307 --> 02:52:23.788]  They co-opt every movement.
[02:52:24.562 --> 02:52:37.373]  And if you look at the fish infusion weapons, if you look at the genetic engineering, open air going in, all the major health problems it's causing, the environmental crises it's causing, and then what are they busy doing?
[02:52:37.393 --> 02:52:49.124]  The elite is busy setting up a world tax off the scam of claiming that what plants breathe, carbon dioxide, is killing the earth.
[02:52:50.345 --> 02:52:58.831]  And then their argument is, okay, well it is a scam, but we've got to get our tax in first for world government to be able to then stop and reverse environmentally what we're doing.
[02:52:59.952 --> 02:53:02.814]  And that's their moral excuse.
[02:53:03.975 --> 02:53:12.521]  But if you really look at who the globalists are and what they do, they're just horribly inbred, incredibly sadistic, murderous, evil people.
[02:53:15.644 --> 02:53:15.784]  And
[02:53:16.821 --> 02:53:23.292]  They are hurtling humanity towards very, very cataclysmic developments.
[02:53:24.204 --> 02:53:27.285]  And they are handing weapons out to every major rival group.
[02:53:27.325 --> 02:53:29.025]  They are doing so many bad things.
[02:53:29.585 --> 02:53:32.466]  CPSing people's children for no reason.
[02:53:32.846 --> 02:53:35.767]  And then drugging them out on Ritalin and Prozac until they're brain damaged.
[02:53:36.107 --> 02:53:38.347]  Just so you make money and have control.
[02:53:38.867 --> 02:53:44.129]  And poisoning our water to dumb us down so the middle class doesn't challenge you for power.
[02:53:44.169 --> 02:53:46.809]  I mean, that is incredibly wicked against the species.
[02:53:46.849 --> 02:53:49.210]  That is a crime against the species.
[02:53:49.250 --> 02:53:49.510]  That is...
[02:53:51.051 --> 02:53:55.115]  There is no excuse, even in your own twisted logic, for what you've done.
[02:53:55.835 --> 02:54:01.580]  And you are not in control.
[02:54:01.660 --> 02:54:02.781]  You are out of control.
[02:54:02.881 --> 02:54:04.903]  You are also losing control globally.
[02:54:05.303 --> 02:54:10.848]  But you arrogantly are just putting the pedal to the metal to accelerate the confrontation with what's left of free humanity.
[02:54:11.749 --> 02:54:18.555]  And the challenge is to people in the elite to really look at yourselves and really look at what you're part of and really look at what you've built.
[02:54:19.558 --> 02:54:27.645]  And that goes from David Rockefeller right down to a cop who's compartmentalized and thinks they're just doing their job and don't see the bigger picture.
[02:54:30.007 --> 02:54:35.031]  Because it is the elites that are pell-mell driving uncontrolled genetic engineering.
[02:54:36.272 --> 02:54:40.816]  It is the elites that are involved in dying core child kidnapping rings.
[02:54:41.397 --> 02:54:43.318]  I mean, in the hundreds of thousands of children a year.
[02:54:43.338 --> 02:54:46.421]  I mean, it's just the numbers of what you do are so huge.
[02:54:47.188 --> 02:54:51.051]  And I know there are many people in the elite system that are just competitive, compartmentalized.
[02:54:51.071 --> 02:54:52.212]  They all have their own pleasures.
[02:54:52.753 --> 02:54:55.295]  Most of them aren't just overtly, totally wicked.
[02:54:55.655 --> 02:54:56.616]  They're just competitive.
[02:54:58.057 --> 02:55:04.423]  And I'm telling people in the lower and middle and even upper strata to count the cost and look at the bigger picture of what you're part of.
[02:55:05.503 --> 02:55:12.810]  And it invites you to come back into the community of true humanity and to realize that...
[02:55:14.221 --> 02:55:23.885]  What you're doing is cutting off your own nose to spite your face that you are not fulfilled and you are unhappy to spite all your power because you've gone against the laws of the universe.
[02:55:24.685 --> 02:55:40.551]  You've gone against everything that it is to be human and be alive and be sentient and conscious and the magic blessing and gift every day of being alive and beholding the natural world and interaction and all the incredible things we have.
[02:55:42.518 --> 02:55:43.279]  We're good to go.
[02:55:43.339 --> 02:55:43.679]  We're good to go.
[02:56:02.603 --> 02:56:04.504]  First hour, particularly powerful.
[02:56:05.024 --> 02:56:07.666]  And I know a lot of AM and FM stations retransmit right now.
[02:56:07.846 --> 02:56:11.948]  If your station doesn't, you can tune back in tomorrow, same time.
[02:56:12.468 --> 02:56:15.470]  Or you can go to InfoWars.com right now, and there's Internet streams.
[02:56:15.750 --> 02:56:16.851]  The show's about to restart.
[02:56:16.871 --> 02:56:19.592]  If you missed the first hour, you've got to go to InfoWars.com.
[02:56:19.612 --> 02:56:20.473]  The streams are right there.
[02:56:20.873 --> 02:56:22.714]  Please spread the word about the show and the films.
[02:56:23.134 --> 02:56:24.395]  God bless you all.
