[00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:06.814]  Holiday travelers hitting the road for the unofficial start of summer have some budget adjustments to make with gas prices at record highs.
[00:00:06.814 --> 00:00:13.639]  The nationwide average for self-serve regular up almost to nickel, and that was overnight, now averaging $3.87 a gallon.
[00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:19.883]  With these daily jumps, it'll be no surprise if it hits $3.90 a gallon this Memorial Day weekend, according to analysts.
[00:00:20.183 --> 00:00:24.687]  Three-time melanoma survivor John McCain is apparently cancer-free and otherwise healthy.

[00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:59.601]  Not stinging and biting.
[00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:01.241]  And itching and scratching.
[00:01:01.241 --> 00:01:04.603]  So this weekend, get Orthomax Lawn Insect Killer.

[00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.190]  Not bugs.
[00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.131]  Get Orthomax this weekend.
[00:01:19.131 --> 00:01:20.652]  Lawn bugs gone.
[00:01:20.652 --> 00:01:21.613]  All season long.
[00:01:23.308 --> 00:01:28.112]  Since the new Subway Big Philly Cheese Steak is meant for everyone, we're trying every advertising approach.
[00:01:28.112 --> 00:01:30.033]  First, the jingle.
[00:01:30.033 --> 00:01:31.355]  Tender steak, melted cheese.
[00:01:31.355 --> 00:01:34.557]  Put a Big Philly in the belly, please.
[00:01:34.557 --> 00:01:36.218]  The celebrity athlete.
[00:01:36.218 --> 00:01:37.620]  Hi, I'm Ryan Howard.

[00:01:39.761 --> 00:01:40.782]  The talking animal.

[00:01:42.724 --> 00:01:43.784]  That just ain't right.
[00:01:43.784 --> 00:01:45.786]  Lastly, the straight announcer.
[00:01:45.786 --> 00:01:47.668]  The new Subway Big Philly Cheese Steak.
[00:01:47.668 --> 00:01:50.470]  Juicy steak and melted cheese on freshly baked bread.
[00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.210]  Subway.
[00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.731]  Eat fresh.
[00:01:53.692 --> 00:02:00.917]  Firefighters in Central California say heavy brush and timber and winds gusting up to 50 miles an hour are proving a pretty good recipe for fire.
[00:02:00.917 --> 00:02:03.178]  Nearly 1,500 homes evacuated.
[00:02:03.178 --> 00:02:07.200]  Governor Schwarzenegger declaring a state of emergency for Santa Cruz County.

[00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.173]  Relief from the federal government should be on its way.
[00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:26.519]  I talked to the National Director of FEMA, as well as the Director of the Department of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff.
[00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:32.065]  They actually were calling me to say they would offer whatever federal assistance was appropriate under the circumstances.
[00:02:32.205 --> 00:02:40.155]  Child welfare officials in Texas are deciding whether to appeal a court decision that pulls the rug out from under a decision to remove hundreds of children from a polygamous sect.
[00:02:40.155 --> 00:02:45.060]  A state appeals court yesterday said the state failed to show the youngsters were in any danger.
[00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.845]  Over 440 children were taken from the ranch during a raid last month.
[00:02:48.845 --> 00:02:51.728]  For the latest news and analysis log on to irnnews.com.

[00:03:04.395 --> 00:03:06.936]  I can buy three and get the fourth tire free?
[00:03:06.936 --> 00:03:08.217]  Any size, any brand.

[00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.801]  But what if I only want one?
[00:03:12.801 --> 00:03:14.402]  Then choose Pep Boys Super Special.

[00:03:28.221 --> 00:03:30.182]  Correspondent Mike Rossi explains.
[00:03:30.182 --> 00:03:35.584]  The proposal would allow telecom lawsuits to go before the secret foreign intelligence surveillance court.
[00:03:35.584 --> 00:03:45.987]  The White House is going along with the proposal after arguing for full immunity for telecommunications companies being sued for allegedly allowing domestic government eavesdropping for nearly six years.
[00:03:45.987 --> 00:03:48.568]  The presidents of China and Russia have condemned a U.S.
[00:03:48.568 --> 00:03:49.428]  plan for a global
[00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:59.436]  ...doesn't help to maintain strategic balance and stability or strengthen international efforts to control proliferation.
[00:03:59.436 --> 00:04:04.259]  The two countries forming closer ties to counterbalance Washington's global dominance.
[00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:09.841]  Israel's Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has been interrogated by police for a second time in a corruption probe.
[00:04:09.841 --> 00:04:16.805]  The allegations and questioning are threatening the Prime Minister's political career along with his government's peace efforts towards Syria and the Palestinians.
[00:04:17.185 --> 00:04:18.526]  No charges have been filed.
[00:04:18.526 --> 00:04:24.650]  Authorities are looking into the possibility Olmert may have taken bribes, violated campaign funding laws, and laundered money.
[00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:31.054]  It's called Click It or Tick It, a nationwide law enforcement effort with zero tolerance for folks who aren't wearing their seatbelts.
[00:04:31.054 --> 00:04:33.735]  Trooper Larry Coggins with the Florida Highway Patrol.
[00:04:33.735 --> 00:04:41.160]  Every day our troopers throughout the state see vehicle crashes involving serious injuries and sometimes death that could have been prevented if someone had just buckled up.
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.510]  We want to remind everyone, not only this holiday weekend, but every single day, drive defensively and buckle up.
[00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:48.331]  I'm Dick Shannon.
[00:04:48.331 --> 00:04:51.155]  You're listening to IRN USA Radio News.
[00:04:54.827 --> 00:05:00.908]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[00:05:00.908 --> 00:05:06.850]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high-stress lifestyles.
[00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.991]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[00:05:10.991 --> 00:05:15.892]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[00:05:16.152 --> 00:05:24.659]  At SnyderHealth.com we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science, the leader in water ionization technology for over 25 years.

[00:06:21.587 --> 00:06:25.229]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:42.594]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on this live Sunday edition.
[00:06:42.594 --> 00:06:49.059]  I did radio six days a week with so much happening, and I always come in on Sunday evenings from 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:06:49.059 --> 00:06:50.500]  Central Standard Time.
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.281]  That's 5 to 7 p.m.
[00:06:52.281 --> 00:06:52.722]  Eastern.
[00:06:52.722 --> 00:07:03.270]  Thank you for tuning in to this worldwide broadcast against tyranny in another attempt to try to wake up my fellow men and women to what's happening in the world.
[00:07:04.915 --> 00:07:07.537]  It, of course, is the 25th of May, 2008.
[00:07:07.537 --> 00:07:09.058]  Tomorrow is Memorial Day.
[00:07:09.058 --> 00:07:17.303]  And I do have some news concerning the war, our troops, the unofficial draft that is going on.
[00:07:17.303 --> 00:07:22.326]  But first, let me just go over some of the news that I'm going to be covering today.
[00:07:22.326 --> 00:07:33.273]  China had another aftershock that made another 70,000 houses collapse and a whole bunch of deaths well past 50 plus thousand.
[00:07:33.871 --> 00:07:37.692]  Dead, just from what happened two weeks ago.
[00:07:37.692 --> 00:07:46.613]  We've also got Hillary Clinton apologizing for saying, hey, you want me to stay in the race, somebody might basically kill Barack Obama.
[00:07:46.613 --> 00:07:54.835]  That's a Clinton threat right there, if there ever was one, and that's what you would expect out of this mafia organization.
[00:07:54.835 --> 00:07:57.335]  Does that mean I'm saying Barack Obama's good?
[00:07:57.335 --> 00:07:57.695]  No!
[00:07:57.695 --> 00:07:59.995]  Gangsters fight with each other.
[00:07:59.995 --> 00:08:03.236]  And they're bought and paid for by the very same interests.
[00:08:04.304 --> 00:08:06.585]  So we'll be going over that.
[00:08:06.585 --> 00:08:10.667]  Also, the Bilderberg Group, they really do govern our world.
[00:08:10.667 --> 00:08:13.508]  If any one group has the greatest control, it's them.
[00:08:13.508 --> 00:08:16.109]  I would say they steer our world.
[00:08:16.109 --> 00:08:23.072]  They don't have total governance government yet, but they're getting close to global governance, as they call it.
[00:08:23.072 --> 00:08:28.035]  And they publish many things talking about how they're doing it and how they're setting it up.
[00:08:28.035 --> 00:08:31.996]  These are the families that own the private central banks that print the money and issue liquidity.
[00:08:31.996 --> 00:08:33.617]  So see, that's why they're able to buy up the world.
[00:08:34.946 --> 00:08:42.069]  They're very upset because we have learned and confirmed their meeting coming up on the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th in Chantilly, Virginia.
[00:08:42.069 --> 00:08:53.494]  I'll be in Virginia covering it, and we'll let you know what we've learned so far from our moles inside Bilderberg coming up today as well.
[00:08:53.494 --> 00:09:03.558]  The New York Times normally has an editor there, so does the Washington Post, but they then write articles saying it doesn't exist, even though other mainstream media for about eight years have been admitting it exists.
[00:09:03.993 --> 00:09:09.635]  Alternative media has been covering it for 40 plus years, been covering it in person for 35.
[00:09:09.635 --> 00:09:11.135]  Jim Tucker and others have.
[00:09:11.135 --> 00:09:13.696]  So just another example of the media's deception.
[00:09:13.696 --> 00:09:16.837]  They go to the event and then say it doesn't exist.
[00:09:16.837 --> 00:09:18.397]  Just amazing.
[00:09:18.397 --> 00:09:24.939]  Squawk Box on MSNBC reporting 12 to 15 dollar a gallon gas is what they predict.
[00:09:24.939 --> 00:09:29.961]  We have another report here, oil per barrel well above $135 per barrel.
[00:09:29.961 --> 00:09:32.962]  Give you an idea, five years ago it was $40 a barrel.
[00:09:32.962 --> 00:09:33.802]  That was considered high.
[00:09:35.207 --> 00:09:43.270]  Also, we'll get into how long it could be until we see $200 a barrel oiled.
[00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:45.851]  You know what frustrates me the most?
[00:09:45.851 --> 00:09:58.595]  I scan through the financial shows, and I read probably ten different financial publications a day, scan through them, some days more, and I interview Nobel Prize winners and the head of the New York Business School, and I interview the head of
[00:10:01.837 --> 00:10:09.182]  Things like Shadow Stats and Congressmen and others, people that are on the House and Senate Banking Committee, Senators and House Members.
[00:10:09.182 --> 00:10:13.505]  And they all know what's going on, but you never see them in the news.
[00:10:13.505 --> 00:10:14.826]  I mean, never, never.
[00:10:14.826 --> 00:10:22.091]  I have probably in the ten times in the last five years heard the media tell the truth.
[00:10:22.091 --> 00:10:23.412]  And that sounds like a lot, but it's not.
[00:10:23.412 --> 00:10:28.916]  I mean, I hear 50 reports or see 50 plus 60 reports a day about oil going up the last five years.
[00:10:29.762 --> 00:10:33.184]  And so I've seen thousands, and it's probably less than 10.
[00:10:33.184 --> 00:10:40.107]  The first time I ever heard the truth said, and of course I already knew it, interviewed experts and understood it, was John Stossel.
[00:10:40.107 --> 00:10:49.372]  The station I'm broadcasting out of, syndicated across the country out of, NewsRadio 590KLBJ, used to air on Sunday nights, John Stossel specials.
[00:10:49.372 --> 00:10:52.754]  And people were griping about $1.50 a gallon, $1.60 a gallon gas, and he went and said,
[00:10:56.963 --> 00:11:05.390]  We got 5% inflation, and so of course, you know, we're up 20% in the last four years because of inflation.
[00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:06.030]  5% a year.
[00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:08.612]  Now, that was back then we had dollar erosion.
[00:11:08.612 --> 00:11:25.065]  This is five years later, and I mean, I never hear anyone tell... I mean, this week there was an MSNBC piece, it's the same one, headline, Squawk Box, Guess Warns of $12 to $15 a gallon gas, and they admitted
[00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:31.032]  Just for a second, they said, well, inflation is the main cause of this.
[00:11:31.032 --> 00:11:36.815]  Then they went into blaming the oil companies and Congress, saying they were all behind it, and this grandstanding.
[00:11:36.815 --> 00:11:37.935]  Congress knows.
[00:11:37.935 --> 00:11:39.816]  Every major economist knows.
[00:11:39.816 --> 00:11:46.719]  These talk show hosts you hear with shows about mutual funds and investments, they all know.
[00:11:46.719 --> 00:11:50.961]  But they don't want to tell you, because I guess they want the dog and pony show to continue forever.
[00:11:50.961 --> 00:11:55.223]  I mean, I'm tied into this fiat system too, but I'm going to tell you the truth.
[00:11:56.308 --> 00:12:03.209]  I mean, we can't just blindly, basically, you know, cover our eyes and jump off the cliff here.
[00:12:03.209 --> 00:12:07.030]  There's still jagged rocks at the bottom here.
[00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:09.471]  Let me explain something to everybody.
[00:12:09.471 --> 00:12:21.933]  The Federal Reserve said we had a 2.3% inflation in 2007, when every other private institution had it between 15 and 13 points.
[00:12:21.933 --> 00:12:23.614]  Let's just say 13 points.
[00:12:23.614 --> 00:12:24.374]  Let's go conservative.
[00:12:25.538 --> 00:12:30.661]  And they're saying less than 3% the private fellow reserve is in Congress before the House Banking Committee.
[00:12:30.661 --> 00:12:32.942]  We've played those clips here.
[00:12:32.942 --> 00:12:36.163]  I mean, this is very insulting to the public.
[00:12:36.163 --> 00:12:37.804]  Very insulting to everyone's intelligence.
[00:12:37.804 --> 00:12:43.447]  But obviously, I don't hear yuppies and know-it-alls and people on talk radio putting out the truth, so they must believe it.
[00:12:44.648 --> 00:12:46.009]  And it's upsetting to me.
[00:12:46.009 --> 00:12:56.452]  I mean, I look at full-grown adults, they're simple-minded, they're smiley-faced, they're happy, they're not bad people, they mean well, but they have the minds of children.
[00:12:56.452 --> 00:13:03.694]  And I don't know how people in the third world know what currency devaluation is, but we can't understand it here.
[00:13:03.694 --> 00:13:05.095]  Well, I know the answer.
[00:13:05.095 --> 00:13:09.516]  It's probably because this has never happened in the United States.
[00:13:09.516 --> 00:13:10.197]  From the 1780s,
[00:13:12.188 --> 00:13:17.031]  Right through to 1900, a dollar was worth a dollar.
[00:13:17.031 --> 00:13:27.817]  And then the private bank started taking over the issuance and control of currency, and now a dollar is worth less than a penny to what it was in 1913.
[00:13:27.817 --> 00:13:33.680]  Now that penny value, that's now what's being devalued down to nothing.
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.942]  And so the oil is denominated in dollars.
[00:13:38.086 --> 00:13:46.532]  And OPEC keeps saying, if you read the foreign papers and actual OPEC statements, they're going, look, we make a small profit, about 20%.
[00:13:46.532 --> 00:13:48.173]  The old companies split it, they get about 9%.
[00:13:48.173 --> 00:14:01.722]  It's still, they buy up refineries and shut them down to create artificial scarcity and bottlenecks, and they do engage in oligopolies and some manipulation, but that's not the main reason you're paying $4.01 on average as of today.
[00:14:05.649 --> 00:14:13.214]  Some areas $5.50 in California and in other areas it's like $3.95 in Texas because we've got refineries here.
[00:14:13.214 --> 00:14:26.262]  The main reason is because the dollar has been devalued by 68% against the Euro since it opened.
[00:14:26.262 --> 00:14:26.803]  68%.
[00:14:26.803 --> 00:14:31.426]  Now, that was already a dollar that had been devalued down to 3 cents on the dollar in 1913.
[00:14:31.426 --> 00:14:33.167]  You're going, wait a minute, you just said 1 cent.
[00:14:34.457 --> 00:14:40.460]  If you go back five and a half, six years ago, when the Euro hit parity with the dollar, 50-50.
[00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.622]  It opened two years before that at 83.
[00:14:42.622 --> 00:14:45.083]  Eighty-three cents to the dollar.
[00:14:45.083 --> 00:14:50.106]  There are different ways of calculating it.
[00:14:50.106 --> 00:14:56.890]  If you look at this, what's happened is, we have a devalued dollar.
[00:14:58.246 --> 00:15:01.229]  And so that's why you're paying more for gas.
[00:15:01.229 --> 00:15:13.882]  And I'm very angry about the fact that I know the globalists hate us, I know they're dismantling the country, breaking up the family, doubling, tripling the police, building prisons everywhere, running warrantless checkpoints where they take blood samples now.
[00:15:13.882 --> 00:15:18.827]  I understand they've got a lawless government, but to see them destroy the dollar,
[00:15:20.697 --> 00:15:28.119]  Because now it's gone from 3 cents 5 years ago to what it was, about 1 cent or less, what it was worth in 1913.
[00:15:28.119 --> 00:15:30.379]  And now that little bit is disappearing.
[00:15:30.379 --> 00:15:33.860]  I mean, all your bank accounts, all your investments, it's all being robbed.
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:38.761]  So when you see your stock market up, it's inflated.
[00:15:38.761 --> 00:15:42.001]  It's like a donut filled with air.
[00:15:42.001 --> 00:15:43.702]  It's not really 12,000, it's more like 4,000.
[00:15:43.702 --> 00:15:45.042]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.143]  It is a big idea.
[00:15:56.269 --> 00:15:58.011]  A New World Order.
[00:15:58.011 --> 00:16:02.935]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:16:02.935 --> 00:16:05.758]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:16:05.758 --> 00:16:08.541]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:16:08.541 --> 00:16:11.724]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:16:11.724 --> 00:16:19.051]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:16:22.051 --> 00:16:27.515]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:16:27.515 --> 00:16:31.397]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:16:31.397 --> 00:16:33.959]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:16:33.959 --> 00:16:35.120]  Most people have no idea.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:35.900]  They're not after money.
[00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:37.161]  They have all the money they need.
[00:16:37.161 --> 00:16:38.162]  They're after power.
[00:16:38.162 --> 00:16:39.323]  That's what I have to do, sir.

[00:16:48.789 --> 00:16:50.830]  Blueprint for global enslaving.
[00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:51.871]  You have been warned.
[00:16:52.771 --> 00:16:56.893]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:16:56.893 --> 00:17:09.597]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking a 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:17:09.597 --> 00:17:10.037]  The U.S.
[00:17:10.037 --> 00:17:15.579]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:17:16.019 --> 00:17:18.981]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:17:18.981 --> 00:17:21.183]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[00:17:21.183 --> 00:17:24.146]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[00:17:24.146 --> 00:17:30.611]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[00:17:30.611 --> 00:17:34.034]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[00:17:34.034 --> 00:17:40.379]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[00:17:40.939 --> 00:17:45.062]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[00:17:45.062 --> 00:17:45.363]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:17:45.363 --> 00:17:45.563]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:54.450]  It's a fact.
[00:17:54.450 --> 00:18:02.032]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:18:02.032 --> 00:18:11.174]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[00:18:11.174 --> 00:18:21.717]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:18:21.977 --> 00:18:28.261]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[00:18:28.261 --> 00:18:33.464]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[00:18:33.464 --> 00:18:38.106]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.

[00:19:55.713 --> 00:19:58.654]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:19:58.654 --> 00:20:00.494]  Home to heart-hitting talk radio.
[00:20:12.554 --> 00:20:16.936]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:20:16.936 --> 00:20:36.421]  If you want to find yourself on the front lines of the info war and find out what's really going on in the world, and what the powerful architects of world government are doing to you right now, what they have stored for you in the future, be sure and visit infowars.com and prisonplanet.com daily.
[00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:40.711]  I want to, I don't normally even throw out a topic.
[00:20:40.711 --> 00:20:43.832]  I cover a bunch of news and then I just go to your calls.
[00:20:43.832 --> 00:20:45.653]  And consequently, we don't screen your calls.
[00:20:45.653 --> 00:20:48.194]  The calls are all over the map.
[00:20:48.194 --> 00:21:02.679]  But I would ask listeners, I would ask people whether they're listening in Austin, Texas or New York or Florida, California, we have stations all over the country, Kansas City right now, Chicago.
[00:21:02.679 --> 00:21:03.940]  Last year, 2007, we had about 13% compounded
[00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:33.102]  Every single year 13% and the year before that was about 10% and about 9% and about 4% 5% I mean you can debate all day in the past years but if you look at the different brokerage houses and different banks and different groups that crunch and give us a real CPI or real inflation we're talking about in the last five years
[00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:42.967]  The average person on a fixed income has had their income cut in half in real purchasing power.
[00:21:42.967 --> 00:21:47.410]  And I can try to make this all technical, but there's really no point.
[00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:55.015]  The government, though, says that inflation is at, now, they were saying 2% last year.
[00:21:55.015 --> 00:21:59.298]  Now they're saying 3-4% this year, depending on which agency.
[00:21:59.298 --> 00:22:02.861]  But the Federal Reserve, the private bank, is saying 3% and some change.
[00:22:03.559 --> 00:22:06.061]  So, so I'm asking you, do you believe the government?
[00:22:06.061 --> 00:22:07.602]  I mean, is this the fault?
[00:22:07.602 --> 00:22:09.963]  I mean, let's go ahead and act like the mainstream media.
[00:22:09.963 --> 00:22:12.245]  Let's not talk about reality and real inflation.
[00:22:12.245 --> 00:22:15.066]  Let's just say, do you feel like there's inflation?
[00:22:15.066 --> 00:22:17.848]  That's how we've been trained to be.
[00:22:17.848 --> 00:22:19.669]  Toll-free number to join us, 877-590-5525.
[00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:20.190]  877-590-5525.
[00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:21.911]  If you're listening in Central Texas, 836-0590.
[00:22:29.858 --> 00:22:44.712]  Because I have people that send me emails and say, you're just anti-government, you just don't like George Bush, you're a dirty Democrat, you're criticizing the economy, the economy's great, we don't have a recession, and the dollar's not devalued, and there's no inflation.
[00:22:44.712 --> 00:22:54.141]  And then if I had time, I'd write back and say, but I'm not anti-gun, I'm not pro-open border, I'm not calling for world government, I don't believe there's any difference between the two parties.
[00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:56.673]  You know, I'm into real issues.
[00:22:56.673 --> 00:23:03.725]  You're caught in a left-right debate which is meant to neutralize you and tie you up in knots while the real world moves on.
[00:23:03.725 --> 00:23:05.728]  And they just answer back, shut up, communist.
[00:23:07.307 --> 00:23:13.992]  And so, a lot of people have bought into the torture, the war, the lies, the police state, the fraud.
[00:23:13.992 --> 00:23:19.075]  And you're along for the ride now, and you're just going to deny and rationalize no matter what you're told.
[00:23:19.075 --> 00:23:22.237]  They tell you the NSA spies on all Americans, no warrants.
[00:23:22.237 --> 00:23:26.780]  They tell you the police are going to take your blood, no warrant on the side of the highway now, at giant checkpoints.
[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:28.161]  You say, amen.
[00:23:28.161 --> 00:23:30.503]  That's land of the free, home of the brave.
[00:23:30.503 --> 00:23:34.005]  They tell you that your gas is going to cost six bucks a gallon.
[00:23:34.005 --> 00:23:35.446]  You're going to say, that's not inflation.
[00:23:36.539 --> 00:23:39.180]  You're living in denial.
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:42.481]  Now, I know that's a minority of people that are living in denial.
[00:23:42.481 --> 00:23:47.383]  Most people have finally woken up and a lot of people have realized that I've been telling you the truth all along.
[00:23:47.383 --> 00:23:51.785]  I mean, I wish the things I talk about weren't coming true.
[00:23:51.785 --> 00:24:05.571]  I read federal documents 12 years ago that said they would introduce it to the public at salons and at gyms and at government institutions and at schools and
[00:24:06.429 --> 00:24:10.231]  Thumbscanning, biometrics, they give grants to businesses to put it in.
[00:24:10.231 --> 00:24:28.497]  They were getting us ready for a cashless society so they can track and trace and tax us and control us and face scanning cameras and license plate reading cameras and Pentagon designed grid they say to control us saying we're an enemy that the military works for foreign banking institutions.
[00:24:28.497 --> 00:24:31.739]  I mean the head of the Naval War College says this on C-SPAN.
[00:24:31.739 --> 00:24:34.520]  That the military works for the global government.
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:34.960]  Kind of like
[00:24:36.314 --> 00:24:39.995]  It's now Blackwater worldwide.
[00:24:39.995 --> 00:24:41.716]  They're now worldwide.
[00:24:41.716 --> 00:24:45.357]  Or Dick Cheney's bought a house in Dubai.
[00:24:45.357 --> 00:24:46.677]  Halliburton's moved to Dubai.
[00:24:46.677 --> 00:24:49.438]  They're all offshore.
[00:24:49.438 --> 00:24:55.680]  You see, but then if you say, hey, they don't deserve no-bid contracts, they say, shut up, we're not giving them to the French.
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:56.940]  They play a mind trick.
[00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:00.522]  Foreigners were never allowed to get the no-bid contracts.
[00:25:00.522 --> 00:25:03.322]  That was other American companies that weren't allowed bids.
[00:25:03.322 --> 00:25:04.803]  But then they played a trick on the radio.
[00:25:05.171 --> 00:25:09.694]  And TV, knowing it would trick mainland conservatives, said, well, the French don't deserve those contracts.
[00:25:09.694 --> 00:25:11.576]  See, I mean, that's just one trick of thousands.
[00:25:11.576 --> 00:25:13.738]  I know almost all their tricks.
[00:25:13.738 --> 00:25:16.760]  And I mean, I've got people watching on TV.
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:18.301]  Here's a hundred plus articles.
[00:25:18.301 --> 00:25:19.042]  I counted them.
[00:25:19.042 --> 00:25:20.683]  Never be able to cover them.
[00:25:20.683 --> 00:25:23.825]  Here's another stack.
[00:25:23.825 --> 00:25:31.091]  There's no way to, I mean, I've got the statesman here about all this baloney about global warming and how it's all over.
[00:25:31.091 --> 00:25:32.732]  We've got to have global taxes.
[00:25:33.422 --> 00:25:37.083]  And Barack Obama says the government's got to control how much food we can eat.
[00:25:37.083 --> 00:25:38.964]  I mean, we're going into feudalism.
[00:25:38.964 --> 00:25:41.785]  And their own documents admit it's an all-of-fraud.
[00:25:41.785 --> 00:25:46.406]  Club of Rome, CFR documents, Rand Corporation, they're all on InfoWars.com.
[00:25:46.406 --> 00:25:47.767]  But, you know, the general public doesn't know.
[00:25:47.767 --> 00:25:52.548]  They're just going to believe the cover of the Statesman.
[00:25:52.548 --> 00:25:54.289]  On this Sunday, here in Austin, Texas.
[00:25:59.355 --> 00:26:02.657]  Bottom line, I can't even articulate all the fraud and lies to you.
[00:26:02.657 --> 00:26:05.859]  The government's gone so bad, so corrupt.
[00:26:05.859 --> 00:26:07.460]  It's simple.
[00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:15.145]  Foreign interest came in, bought up our government, used big think tanks and big policy wonks to fund and finance their own candidates.
[00:26:15.145 --> 00:26:16.606]  They took over our system.
[00:26:16.606 --> 00:26:17.506]  They've used the U.S.
[00:26:17.506 --> 00:26:21.729]  as an engine militarily to take over the planet and hand those interests over to private corporate interest.
[00:26:22.617 --> 00:26:30.722]  Now they have run out all our credit, they've gotten to buy up real assets with it, they've destroyed our currency, and they know we're going to find out about it.
[00:26:30.722 --> 00:26:41.709]  So you hear a local newscast, you know, that says, hey, the Texas Department of Public Safety, the state where I live, boy, they're not ready for terrorism.
[00:26:41.709 --> 00:26:45.532]  They need to, you know, get beefed up and hire more officers and fight terror.
[00:26:45.532 --> 00:26:50.935]  When you hear terrorism, that means someone not giving up their farm or ranch as they're being repossessed.
[00:26:51.573 --> 00:26:53.936]  That means people protesting.
[00:26:53.936 --> 00:27:01.904]  That means DPS intelligence who got caught in the 60s and 70s with files with hundreds of thousands of Texans in it being surveilled illegally.
[00:27:01.904 --> 00:27:04.307]  They're all back doing that again.
[00:27:04.307 --> 00:27:06.790]  That means we're the terrorists, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:10.634]  There's no real Al-Qaeda, Al-Syiada terrorist.
[00:27:10.634 --> 00:27:11.695]  Okay, that's not even real.
[00:27:15.131 --> 00:27:22.592]  So when you hear a newscast about, oh, the DPS needs more funding, or your state police needs more funding to fight terrorism, that means you.
[00:27:22.592 --> 00:27:32.174]  That means more political officers, more spies, more people watching us.
[00:27:32.174 --> 00:27:34.195]  God help us.
[00:27:34.195 --> 00:27:35.495]  God help us.
[00:27:35.495 --> 00:27:37.095]  You ever heard of a hijacking?
[00:27:37.095 --> 00:27:38.775]  You ever heard of a country being seized?
[00:27:38.775 --> 00:27:40.776]  You ever heard of bad people taking over a government?
[00:27:40.776 --> 00:27:41.496]  It's called tyranny.
[00:27:42.116 --> 00:27:44.677]  It happens 99 times out of 100.
[00:27:44.677 --> 00:27:46.018]  It's happened here.
[00:27:46.018 --> 00:28:01.025]  And if we as a nation, school teachers, doctors, lawyers, state policemen, and women, if you'll just decide to stop living a delusion, and stop being ignorant, and look into what I'm saying, we can turn this around.
[00:28:01.025 --> 00:28:05.847]  I mean, I have people email me telling me it's a conspiracy theory that we have high inflation.
[00:28:05.847 --> 00:28:08.368]  We already have hyperinflation.
[00:28:08.368 --> 00:28:09.789]  It's compounding each year.
[00:28:10.999 --> 00:28:17.681]  Your savings, your future, it's all... The country is turning into a third world nation right now.
[00:28:17.681 --> 00:28:21.622]  The globalists got us in this position.
[00:28:21.622 --> 00:28:24.923]  They used our currency to buy up all the infrastructure of the planet.
[00:28:24.923 --> 00:28:27.983]  Now they're imploding it, leaving us holding the bag.
[00:28:27.983 --> 00:28:32.584]  They're talking about us having to pay 87% taxes to, quote, pay off the debt.
[00:28:32.584 --> 00:28:37.066]  See, all this currency that's created, debt's been created and tacked onto our children.
[00:28:37.066 --> 00:28:38.326]  Forget our children, onto us!
[00:28:39.273 --> 00:28:41.062]  I just want you to know who's doing it to you.
[00:28:41.062 --> 00:28:41.946]  We'll be back with your calls.
[00:28:41.946 --> 00:28:43.394]  I want to hear your comments on inflation.
[00:28:54.048 --> 00:28:57.809]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[00:28:57.809 --> 00:29:02.850]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:08.310]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:19.292]  Though the people of the U.S., where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reigning them in and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[00:29:19.292 --> 00:29:23.253]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[00:29:23.673 --> 00:29:24.133]  We're good to go.
[00:29:53.775 --> 00:29:56.117]  Ladies and gentlemen, Ron Paul did not quit.

[00:30:53.691 --> 00:30:57.213]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:30:57.213 --> 00:31:02.615]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:31:02.615 --> 00:31:07.317]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:31:07.757 --> 00:31:19.285]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:31:19.285 --> 00:31:25.069]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:25.069 --> 00:31:31.333]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:31:31.333 --> 00:31:32.373]  What about you?
[00:31:32.373 --> 00:31:34.295]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.

[00:31:52.875 --> 00:31:54.696]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Dimon.

[00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:37.491]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:32:37.491 --> 00:32:38.371]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:33:13.556 --> 00:33:18.857]  More than 300,000 people die a year in the United States.
[00:33:18.857 --> 00:33:19.877]  Go look the numbers up.
[00:33:19.877 --> 00:33:21.258]  CDC admits it.
[00:33:21.258 --> 00:33:22.738]  FDA admits it.
[00:33:22.738 --> 00:33:25.258]  From bad drug interactions.
[00:33:25.258 --> 00:33:28.679]  More than 200,000 die from botched surgeries and infections.
[00:33:28.679 --> 00:33:33.120]  A lot more than die in cars.
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:38.821]  See, 30 years ago, the federal government said, how are we going to federalize the local cities?
[00:33:38.821 --> 00:33:42.162]  They said, well, we've got to have an excuse, something that sounds good.
[00:33:42.162 --> 00:33:43.382]  Oh, we'll say we care about them.
[00:33:44.073 --> 00:33:45.034]  We want them to be safe.
[00:33:45.034 --> 00:33:48.236]  The government could care less.
[00:33:48.236 --> 00:33:54.580]  And so they came into the states and they tell you, click it or tick it, and that gets you used to coming to checkpoints where they see if you're wearing your seatbelt.
[00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:56.242]  Violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[00:33:56.242 --> 00:33:59.064]  And then they want to look inside, see your papers.
[00:33:59.064 --> 00:34:00.204]  You know, it was good in Germany.
[00:34:00.204 --> 00:34:01.145]  It's good here.
[00:34:01.145 --> 00:34:02.406]  Now they want to take your blood.
[00:34:02.406 --> 00:34:07.189]  And from Texas to New York, they pull you over and jam needles in your arms in the dark.
[00:34:07.189 --> 00:34:08.750]  Total violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:10.392]  I thought we're land of the free, home of the brave.
[00:34:10.392 --> 00:34:12.433]  I thought we're the good guys.
[00:34:12.433 --> 00:34:13.754]  We're not like Nazi Germany.
[00:34:15.464 --> 00:34:21.008]  And so all of this is about getting normal people used to having interaction with police.
[00:34:21.008 --> 00:34:26.733]  Kids being, you know, in terror drills, being put in the buses at gunpoint.
[00:34:26.733 --> 00:34:28.294]  You being pulled over, being searched.
[00:34:28.294 --> 00:34:32.197]  It's all about getting you ready to be a slave.
[00:34:32.197 --> 00:34:36.000]  Being watched over, being controlled.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.521]  It's the same thing with man-made global warming.
[00:34:38.521 --> 00:34:40.803]  The Earth heats up, the Earth cools down.
[00:34:40.803 --> 00:34:43.245]  The entire solar system has been heating up.
[00:34:43.598 --> 00:34:49.860]  The ice caps of Mars have been shrinking at about a mile a year for the last 30-plus years.
[00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:59.923]  I was interviewing the head of Live Earth, the big global environmental thing they had last year, and I said, you know, Mars' ice cap is shrinking.
[00:34:59.923 --> 00:35:00.944]  He said, it doesn't have an ice cap.
[00:35:00.944 --> 00:35:03.005]  And I said, yeah, it does.
[00:35:03.005 --> 00:35:05.745]  And then we were talking to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:35:05.745 --> 00:35:10.287]  a few months ago, and we said, hey, the Mars ice cap is shrinking.
[00:35:10.902 --> 00:35:13.223]  He said it doesn't have ice caps and laughed at us.
[00:35:13.223 --> 00:35:16.065]  And then for the general public, they're laughing right now, too!
[00:35:16.065 --> 00:35:26.290]  Just type into Google, Mars Ice Cap, and you'll see photos of it from Viking and all the other explorers, and you can look at its ice caps, but, uh... Point is, the Earth heats up, the Earth cools down.
[00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:33.273]  I mean, where I sit in Texas used to be under 100 feet of water, with, uh, giant, uh, coelacanths, you know, swimming around.
[00:35:33.273 --> 00:35:38.096]  But, um... and mosasaurs.
[00:35:38.096 --> 00:35:38.956]  But that doesn't matter.
[00:35:40.382 --> 00:35:42.583]  All right, I said I'd take your calls on this inflation issue.
[00:35:42.583 --> 00:35:47.286]  Then later I'm going to get into Clinton apologizes for RFK assassination remark.
[00:35:47.286 --> 00:35:51.388]  Yeah, she told a newspaper, as I'm sure all of you know, that, well, I don't understand.
[00:35:51.388 --> 00:35:53.569]  I mean, Bobby Kennedy got killed in June.
[00:35:53.569 --> 00:35:56.891]  That's why we need me to stay in the race.
[00:35:56.891 --> 00:35:57.711]  Open threat.
[00:35:57.711 --> 00:35:59.212]  Everything she says is calculated.
[00:35:59.212 --> 00:36:02.834]  And of course, the government killed Bobby Kennedy.
[00:36:02.834 --> 00:36:04.655]  That's now even admitted on NBC News.
[00:36:05.657 --> 00:36:11.018]  Let's even admit, we've had the guest on this very show, the head of the National Forensic Society.
[00:36:11.018 --> 00:36:12.899]  The BBC's done specials.
[00:36:12.899 --> 00:36:27.922]  Not just the forensics, they now have the film TV footage of three well-known CIA section chiefs in from Asia to run the hit, directing Mr. Caesar to do it, to shoot him in the back, and the coroner said he'd been shot three times in the back, once in the back of the head.
[00:36:27.922 --> 00:36:34.243]  The Sirhan Sirhan was, you know, ten feet away, shooting forward, and had his arm pinned after the first shot with a .22 caliber handgun.
[00:36:35.646 --> 00:36:36.906]  But, I mean, why give you facts?
[00:36:36.906 --> 00:36:38.487]  Why give you evidence?
[00:36:38.487 --> 00:36:46.008]  I mean, you know, they'll just say it's a conspiracy, and Hillary never said, hey, I better stay in, somebody may kill Barack Obama.
[00:36:46.008 --> 00:36:49.209]  And the sun's not up in the sky right now, and the sky isn't blue.
[00:36:49.209 --> 00:36:54.470]  We'll just, again, we're a nation of denial, a nation of denying what's happening.
[00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:59.931]  The private interests that have used this country to take over the world are now going to leave us holding the bag.
[00:36:59.931 --> 00:37:01.672]  That's why you're paying this much for fuel.
[00:37:03.959 --> 00:37:06.161]  Remember, last summer it went up to $3 a gallon.
[00:37:06.161 --> 00:37:06.981]  You were all freaked out.
[00:37:06.981 --> 00:37:08.743]  Then it dropped back down to $2.50.
[00:37:08.743 --> 00:37:11.425]  Now it's gone to $4 something, and it'll drop back down to $3.
[00:37:11.425 --> 00:37:13.066]  And just year by year, it's going to march.
[00:37:13.066 --> 00:37:24.055]  And I told you two years ago, the Bilderberg Group, who runs your life, runs my life, the enemy of freedom, we need to know who the enemy is to get our freedom back, that is the enemy of free people.
[00:37:24.055 --> 00:37:29.739]  If you want to be a slave or a minion, I guess they're your owners, and you should like them.
[00:37:29.739 --> 00:37:31.561]  But they said that by
[00:37:34.781 --> 00:37:37.123]  2009, we would be paying $200 a barrel.
[00:37:37.123 --> 00:37:39.305]  They were going to do that by dollar devaluation.
[00:37:39.305 --> 00:37:42.267]  And our moles inside got this out to you.
[00:37:42.267 --> 00:37:47.511]  We go through great expense and great danger and being arrested and being detained and being shot at.
[00:37:47.511 --> 00:37:51.474]  Oh yeah, it's in my film, Endgame, to bring you this information.
[00:37:51.474 --> 00:37:56.338]  And we're just such a decadent society, it's kind of like, yeah, so what if Alex does that for us?
[00:37:56.338 --> 00:37:56.879]  Ah, you know.
[00:37:59.462 --> 00:38:00.883]  I wonder if Paul still wants to go.
[00:38:00.883 --> 00:38:02.703]  Paul's in there going, hang on, I want to go on the trip with you.
[00:38:02.703 --> 00:38:05.745]  I didn't get shot at, Jim Tucker did, and that was in the newspaper.
[00:38:05.745 --> 00:38:08.366]  Oh yeah, if you get on their property, they open fire on you.
[00:38:08.366 --> 00:38:11.648]  And then the media says it doesn't exist, though.
[00:38:11.648 --> 00:38:14.229]  Okay.
[00:38:14.229 --> 00:38:15.910]  Let's go ahead and go to your calls.
[00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:17.950]  Let's talk to Nicholas in Buffalo.
[00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:19.931]  Nicholas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:38:19.931 --> 00:38:21.772]  Hey Alex, it's a pleasure to talk to you.
[00:38:21.772 --> 00:38:23.333]  First time caller, daily listener.
[00:38:23.992 --> 00:38:26.633]  Let me thank you and all your crew for everything that you do.
[00:38:26.633 --> 00:38:29.793]  You helped to fully wake me up, and I in turn have done the same to others.
[00:38:29.793 --> 00:38:32.014]  Hopefully that will grow exponentially.
[00:38:32.014 --> 00:38:35.915]  Well, it better, because they're building FEMA camps and have brainwashed our police.
[00:38:35.915 --> 00:38:38.995]  Again, they create the crisis, always offer a solution.
[00:38:38.995 --> 00:38:41.376]  Then things get worse, they offer another solution.
[00:38:41.376 --> 00:38:43.596]  Things get worse, they offer another solution.
[00:38:43.596 --> 00:38:46.737]  It's all about enslavement.
[00:38:46.737 --> 00:38:50.218]  It's a very daunting task to wake people up, as I'm sure many of your listeners know.
[00:38:51.096 --> 00:38:57.763]  And let's just hope we can pull all our stuff together and wake up the masses, because like you say, time's running out.
[00:38:57.763 --> 00:39:00.866]  But going back to the inflation topic, of course there's inflation.
[00:39:00.866 --> 00:39:02.588]  No, the government says it's not.
[00:39:03.291 --> 00:39:05.793]  Well, they should go into a local supermarket like I did three years ago.
[00:39:05.793 --> 00:39:07.153]  No, the government doesn't lie, sir.
[00:39:07.153 --> 00:39:08.174]  They care about us.
[00:39:08.174 --> 00:39:11.856]  We should trust them and let them have more police.
[00:39:11.856 --> 00:39:13.357]  Yeah, I'm sure that will solve everything.
[00:39:13.357 --> 00:39:14.377]  Let me explain it, folks.
[00:39:14.377 --> 00:39:23.263]  The police are predominantly there to protect the establishment and the status quo and to make sure you don't riot too bad when they take your bank accounts.
[00:39:23.263 --> 00:39:24.944]  Go ahead.
[00:39:24.944 --> 00:39:31.067]  Going back to the inflation, yeah, I went to the supermarket the other day, and I was just amazed on how much these prices have gone up.
[00:39:31.067 --> 00:39:31.787]  They haven't gone up.
[00:39:31.787 --> 00:39:32.528]  That's a conspiracy.
[00:39:34.727 --> 00:39:45.074]  Listen, they're saying Lou Dobbs is a liar right now in the national news, and that there's no plan for a North American Union, even if there's 300 plus books published by him, and all the official documents, and it's happening.
[00:39:45.074 --> 00:39:47.236]  The media just says it doesn't exist, okay?
[00:39:47.236 --> 00:39:49.558]  Inflation doesn't exist either, you understand?
[00:39:49.558 --> 00:39:50.979]  Learn how to be a slave.
[00:39:50.979 --> 00:39:52.800]  Learn how to be in denial like the rest of the people.
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:55.441]  Uh, no, that's right.
[00:39:55.441 --> 00:39:57.842]  I'll be awake and in tune with what's going on.
[00:39:57.842 --> 00:39:59.322]  That's okay.
[00:39:59.322 --> 00:40:02.684]  By the way, it's all over the hundreds of South American papers.
[00:40:02.684 --> 00:40:07.526]  They formed the South American Union on Friday, and there's nothing in our news.
[00:40:07.526 --> 00:40:12.168]  I'm waiting for them to say the EU doesn't exist.
[00:40:12.168 --> 00:40:13.028]  What else is going on, sir?
[00:40:13.877 --> 00:40:18.819]  Um, actually, I was going to, while we're working on inflation, if you could just touch upon Bilderberg briefly.
[00:40:18.819 --> 00:40:28.622]  I had a conversation with my grandfather the other day ago about how his standard of living in the 40s and 50s was so much higher than it is now, and we kind of briefly talked about that.
[00:40:28.622 --> 00:40:30.623]  Yeah, you didn't have to work as much.
[00:40:30.623 --> 00:40:35.625]  I mean, he was able to single-handedly raise the family for the wife, three kids, put three through college.
[00:40:35.625 --> 00:40:37.766]  Your grandfather didn't exist.
[00:40:37.766 --> 00:40:38.446]  That's not true.
[00:40:39.658 --> 00:40:40.638]  I can attest to that.
[00:40:40.638 --> 00:40:41.178]  Nope.
[00:40:41.178 --> 00:40:41.719]  All lies.
[00:40:41.719 --> 00:40:43.099]  Government's nothing but good.
[00:40:43.099 --> 00:40:44.279]  It does no wrong.
[00:40:44.279 --> 00:40:45.759]  Tasers don't cause heart attacks.
[00:40:45.759 --> 00:40:47.520]  Everything's fine.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:48.780]  Everything's definitely not fine.
[00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:49.460]  One more thing.
[00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:51.541]  You could touch upon Bilderberg.
[00:40:51.541 --> 00:40:54.181]  Who do you think will be picking for Vice President?
[00:40:54.181 --> 00:40:55.061]  And I guess that'll be it.
[00:40:55.061 --> 00:40:55.802]  It was a pleasure talking to you.
[00:40:55.802 --> 00:40:56.242]  Thank you.
[00:40:56.242 --> 00:40:59.622]  Let me take more calls and I'll come back and answer that because I have a Bilderberg section here.
[00:40:59.622 --> 00:41:00.043]  Thank you.
[00:41:00.043 --> 00:41:01.483]  Great call.
[00:41:01.483 --> 00:41:05.444]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ed in Toronto, Canada.
[00:41:05.444 --> 00:41:06.204]  Ed, you're on the air.
[00:41:06.204 --> 00:41:06.524]  Welcome.
[00:41:08.025 --> 00:41:10.306]  9-11 was an inside job!
[00:41:10.306 --> 00:41:17.750]  9-11 was an inside job!
[00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:21.632]  Folks, that is, um, that is Troy from West Virginia.
[00:41:21.632 --> 00:41:24.193]  He is something else.
[00:41:24.193 --> 00:41:25.213]  Oh, man.
[00:41:25.213 --> 00:41:28.174]  Unbelievable.
[00:41:28.174 --> 00:41:35.918]  Troy likes to call people up until they blow up at them at their homes, 9-11 truthers, and then edit it and put it on the web, but it's not too effective, Troy.
[00:41:37.344 --> 00:41:40.925]  Actually, Troy is a very scary person if you really want to get down to it.
[00:41:40.925 --> 00:41:45.346]  Not many people will call you up privately and tell you the type of things he will.
[00:41:45.346 --> 00:41:46.467]  But he's a nice guy.
[00:41:46.467 --> 00:41:47.327]  Hope he's doing well.
[00:41:47.327 --> 00:41:49.288]  The dollar's not devalued, Troy.
[00:41:49.288 --> 00:41:50.548]  Everything's fine, that's right.
[00:41:50.548 --> 00:41:51.888]  Economy's doing great.
[00:41:51.888 --> 00:41:56.510]  I remember you two years ago telling me that the economy was great and the dollar wasn't being devalued.
[00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:58.270]  Do I have time for one more?
[00:41:58.270 --> 00:41:58.831]  I think I do.
[00:41:58.831 --> 00:41:59.931]  Let's go ahead and jam in.
[00:42:00.572 --> 00:42:01.373]  Steve in Texas.
[00:42:01.373 --> 00:42:02.613]  Go ahead, Steve.
[00:42:02.613 --> 00:42:04.455]  Yeah, good afternoon, Alex.
[00:42:04.455 --> 00:42:08.377]  First of all, I wanted to say to Troy, you won't be laughing when you're in the FEMA camp.
[00:42:08.377 --> 00:42:09.438]  Oh, he probably won't be.
[00:42:09.438 --> 00:42:12.360]  He'll probably be, you know, the boss at one.
[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:19.305]  Yeah, I just wanted to say I was having a conversation with three gentlemen at a tire shop I went to the other day.
[00:42:20.098 --> 00:42:28.704]  And my ears perked up when they were talking about the oil prices and the gas, and they were upset because the oil companies are saying that, you know, this has nothing to do with the price of the oil.
[00:42:28.704 --> 00:42:28.944]  Stay there.
[00:42:28.944 --> 00:42:31.125]  I want to hear how you tried to explain it to these idiots.
[00:42:31.125 --> 00:42:31.665]  Okay.
[00:42:31.665 --> 00:42:34.347]  And they probably wanted to... Stay there.
[00:42:34.347 --> 00:42:35.088]  Let me hang up on you.
[00:42:35.088 --> 00:42:35.968]  It was an accident.
[00:42:35.968 --> 00:42:37.309]  Call right back.
[00:42:37.309 --> 00:42:39.130]  Can't even hit the right number.
[00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:42.532]  I'm so shaken up by Troy.
[00:42:42.532 --> 00:42:43.273]  877-590-5525.
[00:42:43.273 --> 00:42:43.993]  Call right back in.
[00:42:43.993 --> 00:42:46.395]  I want to hear... Keep a line open for him.
[00:42:46.395 --> 00:42:47.375]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:47.375 --> 00:42:48.136]  InfoWars.com.
[00:42:53.294 --> 00:42:59.117]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[00:42:59.117 --> 00:43:04.561]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[00:43:04.561 --> 00:43:09.924]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[00:43:09.924 --> 00:43:15.847]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[00:43:15.847 --> 00:43:20.110]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life,
[00:43:20.310 --> 00:43:22.051]  Most people are overly acidic.
[00:43:22.051 --> 00:43:25.834]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[00:43:25.834 --> 00:43:30.658]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[00:43:30.658 --> 00:43:31.719]  Do your part.
[00:43:31.719 --> 00:43:34.321]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!
[00:43:34.321 --> 00:43:40.446]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink
[00:43:40.766 --> 00:43:43.531]  Up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.

[00:43:52.557 --> 00:43:54.658]  My cracked heels were always my nemesis.
[00:43:54.658 --> 00:43:59.201]  All my life, I've had dry heels and rough, thickened skin on the soles and sides of my feet.
[00:43:59.201 --> 00:44:02.163]  Then my podiatrist told me about Kallax Ointment.
[00:44:02.163 --> 00:44:06.526]  I am amazed how fast and efficient this product is at softening the hard spots.
[00:44:06.526 --> 00:44:12.030]  Since using Kallax, the split and cracked skin on my heels is gone, leaving them smooth and healthy-looking.
[00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:15.132]  I'm so grateful, and no longer embarrassed in sandals.
[00:44:15.132 --> 00:44:18.354]  If you have dry, cracked feet, I recommend Kallax Ointment.
[00:44:18.354 --> 00:44:22.357]  You'll find it in the foot care section at drugstores, mass retailers, and supercenters.
[00:44:23.738 --> 00:44:26.679]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[00:44:26.679 --> 00:44:29.300]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:33.122]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:44:33.122 --> 00:44:40.366]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.

[00:44:53.752 --> 00:44:56.614]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:44:56.614 --> 00:44:58.175]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[00:44:58.175 --> 00:45:00.316]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:45:00.316 --> 00:45:02.218]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:45:02.218 --> 00:45:03.699]  The late great USA.
[00:45:03.699 --> 00:45:05.480]  America, freedom to fascism.

[00:45:58.991 --> 00:46:03.813]  They get closer and closer, and suddenly you have a sense something bad is going to happen.
[00:46:03.813 --> 00:46:06.314]  What are you going to do to defend yourself?
[00:46:06.314 --> 00:46:11.017]  Tebowtech specializes in non-lethal self-defense products for you and your family.

[00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:57.380]  That's t-b-o-t-e-c-h dot com.
[00:46:57.380 --> 00:47:01.506]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:47:17.489 --> 00:47:18.370]  You know what's going on?
[00:47:18.370 --> 00:47:22.693]  It's like a faith with people that love government.
[00:47:22.693 --> 00:47:31.260]  Liberals, socialists, they really believe government can deliver Valhalla, milk and honey floating around on clouds, always delivers despotism.
[00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:37.345]  Anytime you centralize something, control freaks, criminals are going to get control of the levers.
[00:47:37.345 --> 00:47:41.648]  That's why free market and individual liberty and local control is the way to go.
[00:47:41.648 --> 00:47:43.530]  You know, global government is not the way to go.
[00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:43.550]  A,
[00:47:44.443 --> 00:47:49.167]  Even if you had angels running it, the second they weren't in control, some thug would get control.
[00:47:49.167 --> 00:47:57.954]  B, psychopathic control freaks are the ones setting up global government, and we can't even get the general public to admit global government's being set up.
[00:47:57.954 --> 00:48:01.356]  They said years ago they were going to jack up oil prices.
[00:48:01.356 --> 00:48:05.600]  They said they wanted to bring down our standard of living, that we didn't deserve to live this well.
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:08.182]  Now I've heard Barack Obama out running around saying that.
[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:14.882]  The government's going to control how much you can eat, what you can wear, where you go, track everything you do.
[00:48:14.882 --> 00:48:23.964]  I remember like seven, eight years ago reading different government policy reports about how they were going to get rid of cash.
[00:48:23.964 --> 00:48:27.065]  You're still going to have cash, but it's going to have an RFID in it.
[00:48:27.065 --> 00:48:33.606]  And so when you scan it, it will then have a record of who you are, where you went, what you did, and they'll use that to control you.
[00:48:33.606 --> 00:48:34.687]  There'll be nowhere to run.
[00:48:34.687 --> 00:48:36.387]  Imagine Hitler if he had those powers.
[00:48:38.223 --> 00:48:46.190]  And now they're saying, oh, federal court ruling, the blind can't use the money, so the government has to come out with the money with chips in it.
[00:48:46.190 --> 00:49:01.823]  But then, 15 years ago, and I learned about it in the last 7 or 8, we wrote articles about it at PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com, the government came out and said that they were going to phase this in and use it to control, track and trace, and that way you can't escape 80-90% taxes.
[00:49:05.891 --> 00:49:13.776]  It's unspeakable the things that are happening and the things that are developing and the things that are unfolding and a lot of people are in denial about it.
[00:49:13.776 --> 00:49:24.182]  I mean, I wish that Troy from West Virginia would have been serious and would have, you know, said, hey Alex, I think you're a liar.
[00:49:24.182 --> 00:49:25.783]  The dollar's not being devalued.
[00:49:25.783 --> 00:49:33.688]  I distinctly remember that guy calling last year and me saying that and him laughing at me and saying, no, it's not happening.
[00:49:33.688 --> 00:49:33.888]  I mean,
[00:49:34.989 --> 00:49:37.371]  It is not an attribute to deny what's happening.
[00:49:37.371 --> 00:49:42.295]  If we admit what's happening, the globalists won't be able to politically carry this out.
[00:49:42.295 --> 00:49:43.235]  I said I'm taking your calls.
[00:49:43.235 --> 00:49:44.236]  Let's just go to them.
[00:49:44.236 --> 00:49:47.218]  I actually hung up on a caller who was telling me about stuff in New York.
[00:49:47.218 --> 00:49:49.100]  Did we ever get him back on?
[00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:49.901]  He never called back.
[00:49:49.901 --> 00:49:54.024]  I wanted to hear what... He was in a tire shop and he was saying they were blaming the oil companies for it.
[00:49:54.024 --> 00:49:55.605]  I'm not defending the oil companies.
[00:49:55.605 --> 00:49:58.547]  They did buy up the refineries to close them.
[00:49:58.547 --> 00:49:59.628]  We have their own documents.
[00:49:59.628 --> 00:50:01.790]  Associated Press, 2001.
[00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:03.071]  Did big reports on it.
[00:50:03.071 --> 00:50:04.632]  It was Texaco.
[00:50:05.359 --> 00:50:30.276]  Dutch Rochelle, BP, Exxon Mobil, and they've said right there, and by the way, you can just Google this if you want, oil companies reduced refining capacity, oil companies bought up refineries to create bottleneck, it should pop up for you there, but they bought up private refineries and shut them down to create an artificial bottleneck.
[00:50:30.276 --> 00:50:33.779]  So they're involved too, but they're only buying
[00:50:34.637 --> 00:50:44.460]  And exploring from the different leaseholders and the people that they're getting those leases from, those nations, those private individuals.
[00:50:44.460 --> 00:51:00.945]  And again, most of this is that the dollar is being devalued, and now it's causing other fiat currencies to have their own crises, and so some of those are also devaluing, and so global inflation has kicked off.
[00:51:00.945 --> 00:51:02.726]  I can't believe I have to even explain this.
[00:51:04.437 --> 00:51:13.503]  How do we go from being the smartest, most intelligent, most informed people in the world, in the U.S., to being the dumbest by every benchmark?
[00:51:13.503 --> 00:51:17.166]  I have just such a sad feeling that all this is happening.
[00:51:17.166 --> 00:51:20.628]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Benny in Indiana.
[00:51:20.628 --> 00:51:22.249]  Benny, you're on the air.
[00:51:22.249 --> 00:51:23.530]  Yeah, Alejandro.
[00:51:23.530 --> 00:51:24.291]  Yes.
[00:51:24.291 --> 00:51:25.852]  Yeah, Benny in northwest Indiana.
[00:51:25.852 --> 00:51:32.577]  Hey, ever since this political process started with trying to find a nominee, you have preached that
[00:51:33.396 --> 00:51:37.278]  You thought Hillary was the anointed one, and I totally agreed with you.
[00:51:37.278 --> 00:51:41.381]  But now, here lately, it's sort of looking the other way.
[00:51:41.381 --> 00:51:42.642]  What's your take on that?
[00:51:42.642 --> 00:51:50.487]  I was about to say, I am rarely wrong, and I am wrong about this, but I mean, Newt Gingrich likes to brag.
[00:51:50.487 --> 00:51:55.810]  He came out and said, we're going to get hit by terrorists, we're going to take all your rights, and then when it happened, he said, see, I told you so.
[00:51:55.810 --> 00:52:01.694]  I mean, Gary Hart bragged beforehand about it with the CFR, these policy makers, they like to
[00:52:02.148 --> 00:52:11.991]  Bragg, and he said it was going to be a Hillary Clinton slash Barack Obama ticket with her as the president and him as the VP.
[00:52:11.991 --> 00:52:17.972]  And that is what everybody else said, and that is what it looked like to me.
[00:52:17.972 --> 00:52:30.816]  I mean, when I saw Rupert Murdoch giving her money, having secret fundraisers for her, when I saw Roger Ailes advising her, and you saw Limbaugh come into her aid and try to get her elected, you know, claiming, oh, I'm doing this to mess him up.
[00:52:30.816 --> 00:52:31.496]  Yeah, sure he is.
[00:52:32.505 --> 00:52:35.506]  Uh, you know, has dinner with Clinton or hangs out with Clinton.
[00:52:35.506 --> 00:52:38.367]  Uh, but, uh, and the Clintons are vacationing with the Bushes.
[00:52:38.367 --> 00:52:39.507]  That's admitted.
[00:52:39.507 --> 00:52:40.768]  They call him the surrogate son.
[00:52:40.768 --> 00:52:41.288]  Bush Sr.
[00:52:41.288 --> 00:52:42.448]  does.
[00:52:42.448 --> 00:52:44.129]  And Barbara does.
[00:52:44.129 --> 00:52:45.929]  Uh, so, but it doesn't matter.
[00:52:45.929 --> 00:52:48.390]  Barack Obama has been given the anointing of Bilderberg.
[00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:51.991]  Uh, but normally both candidates are from either party, so it doesn't matter.
[00:52:51.991 --> 00:52:56.052]  Both the frontrunners of the Democratic and then both the frontrunners of the Republican.
[00:52:56.052 --> 00:53:01.794]  And we have the proof of that from past Bilderberg minutes that we've stolen, uh, at great risk to ourselves.
[00:53:02.386 --> 00:53:05.689]  So the general public can giggle and snicker about it.
[00:53:05.689 --> 00:53:06.970]  Oh, there's no ruling elite.
[00:53:06.970 --> 00:53:08.231]  Those don't exist.
[00:53:08.231 --> 00:53:11.213]  So it does now look like he is being positioned.
[00:53:11.213 --> 00:53:21.701]  But Jesse Ventura said on my show a month and a half ago and again this week when he was back on, former governor, he said, man, I feel like they're going to kill Barack Obama because they want that power.
[00:53:21.701 --> 00:53:23.222]  That doesn't mean he's a good guy.
[00:53:23.222 --> 00:53:26.245]  It means there's some type of power struggle at the higher levels.
[00:53:26.245 --> 00:53:28.126]  And we know those happen throughout history.
[00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:35.005]  I mean, there have been power struggles, not just in the U.S., but all over the world over and over again between political groups.
[00:53:35.005 --> 00:53:42.951]  Only in this modern domesticated country has the public been told that there's no such thing as political assassination or political subterfuge.
[00:53:42.951 --> 00:53:49.436]  There's subterfuge at your job and your business and your life, but not with powerful people controlling trillions of dollars.
[00:53:49.436 --> 00:53:50.417]  They don't want power.
[00:53:50.417 --> 00:53:52.038]  They don't engage in risk-taking.
[00:53:52.038 --> 00:53:54.159]  They don't engage in brinksmanship.
[00:53:54.159 --> 00:53:58.102]  You know, that's like saying Indy 500 racers don't take risk.
[00:53:58.102 --> 00:53:58.643]  Anything else, sir?
[00:53:59.414 --> 00:54:15.267]  Yeah, well I was curious, if Verama does get the nomination, because I come from, uh, racism is a big part of this Northwest Indiana here, and I've had people tell me that if he does get the nomination, even though they're Democrats, they said they're going to vote for McCain.
[00:54:15.267 --> 00:54:18.249]  Do you think that'll open up doors for him to get elected?
[00:54:18.249 --> 00:54:19.210]  Yes, I do.
[00:54:19.210 --> 00:54:22.933]  They've, they've, but listen, I've never seen something this weird.
[00:54:22.933 --> 00:54:27.016]  I've never seen an election where all three candidates are this rotten.
[00:54:28.745 --> 00:54:34.808]  I mean, Barack Obama wants socialized healthcare.
[00:54:34.808 --> 00:54:37.969]  Hillary wants it where you get arrested if you don't pay in.
[00:54:37.969 --> 00:54:39.950]  Barack Obama wants that, too.
[00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:41.650]  McCain has had lymphoma.
[00:54:41.650 --> 00:54:45.532]  90% of the time you die within 10 years of it.
[00:54:45.532 --> 00:54:47.613]  He had it removed 8 years ago.
[00:54:47.613 --> 00:54:50.974]  I mean, he's not a real candidate.
[00:54:50.974 --> 00:54:52.394]  He's got all sorts of health problems.
[00:54:52.394 --> 00:54:52.815]  What, he's 76, is it?
[00:54:55.119 --> 00:54:57.500]  I mean, he's just not up to being the President.
[00:54:57.500 --> 00:54:58.580]  It doesn't matter.
[00:54:58.580 --> 00:55:00.020]  We all focus on the President.
[00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:02.241]  It doesn't matter.
[00:55:02.241 --> 00:55:05.781]  All three horses are bought and paid for.
[00:55:05.781 --> 00:55:12.783]  And so we can pick which pony we think is going to win the prickness, but it doesn't matter.
[00:55:12.783 --> 00:55:16.483]  Why don't people watch professional boxing anymore?
[00:55:16.483 --> 00:55:19.684]  Because everybody knows most of the fights are rigged, and it's come out they've been rigged.
[00:55:21.912 --> 00:55:25.193]  And Don King calling it a conspiracy theory doesn't make it so.
[00:55:25.193 --> 00:55:27.534]  So, professional boxing is dying.
[00:55:27.534 --> 00:55:31.456]  And ultimate fighting... By the way, I got Joe Rogan coming on Tuesday.
[00:55:31.456 --> 00:55:32.056]  Host of that.
[00:55:32.056 --> 00:55:34.417]  What are you in there laughing at?
[00:55:34.417 --> 00:55:37.759]  Both the guys in there are fans of that?
[00:55:37.759 --> 00:55:44.842]  Boy, did he... I heard Saturday he looked like he'd smoked about a half pound of marijuana on that show.
[00:55:44.842 --> 00:55:47.323]  Did you watch it, Trey?
[00:55:47.323 --> 00:55:50.284]  I was at the office and Rob and the... Whoa, man!
[00:55:50.913 --> 00:55:54.074]  Your audio is so high, I just had my ears blown out.
[00:55:54.074 --> 00:55:57.616]  Good Lord, Eddie Bear.
[00:55:57.616 --> 00:55:59.437]  Well, yeah, that's because my audio is so low to me.
[00:55:59.437 --> 00:56:03.399]  With my audio, because you turned me down so low, then you're turned way up.
[00:56:03.399 --> 00:56:04.199]  It doesn't matter.
[00:56:04.199 --> 00:56:05.019]  It doesn't matter anymore.
[00:56:05.019 --> 00:56:08.961]  I mean, sometimes I just think I ought to get the hell out of here and go to a third world country.
[00:56:08.961 --> 00:56:13.463]  And let this nation of just... I mean, I mean, you really got to admit, I mean, I look at adults.
[00:56:13.463 --> 00:56:19.046]  I was driving on South Congress earlier, and these adults are all out happy, sitting by their bikes, looking at the sunny day.
[00:56:19.537 --> 00:56:23.378]  Everybody oh so friendly and it just lambs to the slaughter.
[00:56:23.378 --> 00:56:26.679]  They just have no idea what the real world holds for them.
[00:56:26.679 --> 00:56:28.940]  No idea what's going on.
[00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:31.661]  And I don't even like being up here preaching today.
[00:56:31.661 --> 00:56:39.364]  I mean things are so bad that I can't articulate how serious they are.
[00:56:39.364 --> 00:56:44.345]  How perilous they are.
[00:56:44.345 --> 00:56:45.306]  We got all these callers.
[00:56:47.602 --> 00:56:50.223]  Let's go ahead and talk to George in Florida.
[00:56:50.223 --> 00:56:51.924]  George, you're on the air.
[00:56:51.924 --> 00:56:53.985]  Alright, happy Memorial Day to you, Jack.
[00:56:53.985 --> 00:56:57.266]  I mean, Alex, sorry.
[00:56:57.266 --> 00:57:08.471]  I just want to say, in Florida, they just passed a bill called 2532, where they're going to accelerate the termination of parental rights, and me and my wife are talking about evacuating Florida.
[00:57:08.471 --> 00:57:09.972]  You need to get out of Florida.
[00:57:09.972 --> 00:57:14.934]  They've got the largest child kidnapping service, CPS, in the country.
[00:57:15.646 --> 00:57:17.447]  They have been caught every year.
[00:57:17.447 --> 00:57:22.029]  Just Google top Florida CPS officials pedophiles or family services.
[00:57:22.029 --> 00:57:24.290]  It's a pedophile guild completely.
[00:57:24.290 --> 00:57:26.691]  Well, kind of like Texas Youth Commission.
[00:57:26.691 --> 00:57:28.592]  They had rape parties.
[00:57:28.592 --> 00:57:31.434]  All the Cadillacs would pull up to come in and rape the kids.
[00:57:31.434 --> 00:57:33.535]  And they kind of just swept it under the rug.
[00:57:33.535 --> 00:57:33.995]  Stay there.
[00:57:33.995 --> 00:57:35.116]  I'm not going to hang up on you.
[00:57:35.116 --> 00:57:36.036]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[00:57:36.036 --> 00:57:38.137]  We're going to come back to you after the news.
[00:57:38.137 --> 00:57:39.118]  We'll talk about it.
[00:57:39.118 --> 00:57:40.918]  That's a whole other facet to this.
[00:57:40.918 --> 00:57:41.639]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:41.639 --> 00:57:42.019]  Stay with us.

[00:59:16.161 --> 00:59:27.005]  It's five o'clock in Austin, Texas.
[00:59:27.005 --> 00:59:41.450]  Good afternoon, I'm Jill at Heart State.
[00:59:41.450 --> 00:59:45.412]  To this world I am unimportant
[00:59:46.984 --> 00:59:49.444]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:57.636 --> 01:00:04.038]  Homes that survived this month's earthquake in central China have now been destroyed by a powerful aftershock.
[01:00:04.038 --> 01:00:09.579]  At least one person was killed by the magnitude 6 point tremor and more than 400 others were injured.
[01:00:09.579 --> 01:00:14.000]  The death toll from the initial quake has risen now to more than 62,000.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.241]  Lebanon's parliament has elected an army chief as its president.
[01:00:17.641 --> 01:00:20.402]  For White House Reaction, correspondent Connie Lawn.
[01:00:20.402 --> 01:00:32.088]  President Bush says he's confident Lebanon has chosen a leader committed to protecting its sovereignty, extending the government's authority over all of Lebanon, and upholding Lebanon's international obligations under U.N.
[01:00:32.088 --> 01:00:34.189]  Security Council resolutions.
[01:00:34.189 --> 01:00:41.412]  And President Bush says, we look forward to working with President Sleiman in pursuit of our common values of freedom and independence.
[01:00:41.812 --> 01:00:43.153]  Connie Long, The White House.
[01:00:43.153 --> 01:00:44.815]  The price of gasoline still rising.
[01:00:44.815 --> 01:00:48.057]  AAA reports average regular now $3.93 a gallon.
[01:00:48.057 --> 01:00:51.460]  This is IRN USA Radio News.

[01:01:01.348 --> 01:01:02.389]  I felt self-conscious.

[01:06:28.016 --> 01:06:30.538]  You were down visiting your folks over the weekend.
[01:06:30.538 --> 01:06:36.982]  You were telling me during a break and you said you were in the backseat with family not wearing seatbelts and they pulled you over.
[01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:41.283]  And gave you tickets for that, and you got the ticket there.
[01:06:41.283 --> 01:06:47.768]  And then I went online and looked it up on the state website, because I thought, we don't have to be wearing seatbelt.
[01:06:47.768 --> 01:06:51.090]  And the city municipalities have to follow state law.
[01:06:51.090 --> 01:06:54.253]  And sure enough, my memory was right.
[01:06:54.253 --> 01:06:57.956]  It's front seat, but in the new America, it doesn't matter.
[01:06:57.956 --> 01:07:02.479]  And I bet if you go to court, judge will say, doesn't matter.
[01:07:02.479 --> 01:07:03.080]  It doesn't matter.
[01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:05.021]  You're going to, it's just law.
[01:07:05.021 --> 01:07:07.323]  I mean, they tell you to take vaccines and there's no law.
[01:07:08.902 --> 01:07:12.443]  But it's for your own safety, so why not have him break the law?
[01:07:12.443 --> 01:07:13.924]  So tell me what happened.
[01:07:13.924 --> 01:07:16.505]  Well, I'll definitely keep you posted, because I'm going to fight it.
[01:07:16.505 --> 01:07:23.427]  But yeah, no, I just got, me and my folks were in the Taurus, about to see Indiana Jones.
[01:07:23.427 --> 01:07:26.608]  Committing a thought crime, Al Qaeda.

[01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:33.190]  And got pulled over as we were riding by, and you know, it was really bad.
[01:07:33.190 --> 01:07:37.192]  Now, you said your dad had his on, but he still got a ticket, but you guys were in the backseat.
[01:07:37.192 --> 01:07:37.452]  Yeah.
[01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:46.992]  He had his on, but he had it, you know, because my dad's a bigger guy, so the girth, you know, I don't know, he has a, he had it under his arm, tucked under his arm.
[01:07:46.992 --> 01:07:51.912]  The cop said, well, the sheriff said that, uh, it was on, it wasn't on properly.
[01:07:51.912 --> 01:07:52.833]  Yeah, well, that's not true.
[01:07:52.833 --> 01:07:54.893]  It actually, you have to have a one over your stomach.
[01:07:54.893 --> 01:07:58.454]  I actually have the code here for people out in their squad cars saying I'm full of it.
[01:07:58.454 --> 01:08:00.434]  I could just read all this if they'd like it on air.
[01:08:00.434 --> 01:08:02.654]  I just Googled Texas seatbelt laws.
[01:08:02.654 --> 01:08:06.175]  Uh, now, uh, to, to, uh, be clear, there are laws on child safety seats.
[01:08:06.175 --> 01:08:06.635]  That's different.
[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:07.100]  Yeah.
[01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:09.701]  But there is no law in the back seat.
[01:08:09.701 --> 01:08:14.662]  And I'm looking at the last legislative session and the last time they updated this.
[01:08:14.662 --> 01:08:16.242]  Because see, man, I know the law.
[01:08:16.242 --> 01:08:19.043]  And I mean, if I would have known... That isn't good enough, Slate.
[01:08:19.043 --> 01:08:23.424]  But if I would have known that I could get a ticket for not having that seat, I would have put it on.
[01:08:23.424 --> 01:08:24.844]  But there is no law, sir.
[01:08:24.844 --> 01:08:25.404]  There's no law.
[01:08:25.404 --> 01:08:25.984]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:08:25.984 --> 01:08:29.025]  I was in the back and I thought, I don't... There's no law to take vaccines.
[01:08:29.025 --> 01:08:34.486]  They had 1,500 kids in Maryland lined up with police dogs barking at them and take it, crying, saying, it's the law, I got to do it.
[01:08:34.486 --> 01:08:34.866]  No law.
[01:08:35.475 --> 01:08:37.416]  This government is lawless, my friend.
[01:08:37.416 --> 01:08:41.159]  Listen, you go to court, and you find it, and you make that guy come in there.
[01:08:41.159 --> 01:08:43.421]  And you make him get up there on the stand.
[01:08:43.421 --> 01:08:44.882]  Yeah, I'm all over it.
[01:08:44.882 --> 01:08:45.422]  I got you.
[01:08:45.422 --> 01:08:47.204]  Okay, good.
[01:08:47.204 --> 01:08:47.764]  Have a good one.
[01:08:47.764 --> 01:08:49.365]  The government's now proven it's your God.
[01:08:49.365 --> 01:08:51.607]  Alright, let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[01:08:51.607 --> 01:08:56.611]  We were talking to, uh... Who was the last guy I was talking to where they CPS'd his kids?
[01:08:56.611 --> 01:08:57.331]  Or, no.
[01:08:57.331 --> 01:09:01.274]  They're changing the law where they just CPS them even faster.
[01:09:01.274 --> 01:09:02.455]  He was in Florida.
[01:09:02.455 --> 01:09:03.696]  It was George?
[01:09:03.696 --> 01:09:04.737]  Was it George I was talking to?
[01:09:05.854 --> 01:09:08.295]  Yeah, it was George.
[01:09:08.295 --> 01:09:12.317]  Listen, I'm not, folks, I don't just say stuff on air.
[01:09:12.317 --> 01:09:14.218]  Okay?
[01:09:14.218 --> 01:09:17.839]  Like, I wouldn't even joke about Joe Rogan if I hadn't seen him smoke marijuana.
[01:09:17.839 --> 01:09:19.540]  I don't smoke it, I'm friends with Joe.
[01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:28.844]  I wouldn't even joke, even though he was totally stoned on TV, you know, as the commentator and the announcer for Ultimate Fighting Championships.
[01:09:28.844 --> 01:09:30.725]  And I wouldn't say that
[01:09:33.311 --> 01:09:42.797]  Going back five, six years ago, every year they have to fire the leadership of the CPS, it's called Family Services in Florida, because they're all child rapists.
[01:09:42.797 --> 01:09:46.180]  I mean, the number one, the number two, the number three guy.
[01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:49.302]  It's a guild of them.
[01:09:49.302 --> 01:09:53.545]  3,000 plus children missing in 2003, and then they never said where they went.
[01:09:53.545 --> 01:09:54.565]  These are kids they took.
[01:09:54.565 --> 01:09:56.607]  You want to know who kidnaps the kids?
[01:09:56.607 --> 01:09:57.908]  It's the government.
[01:09:57.908 --> 01:10:01.450]  And they love to find some weirdo polygamist sect doing some weird stuff.
[01:10:01.758 --> 01:10:07.341]  So they can run in with their armored tanks and act all big and act like the saviors.
[01:10:07.341 --> 01:10:14.626]  By the way, somebody sent it to me and I didn't believe it, so I went and found the AP photo and I blew it up myself.
[01:10:14.626 --> 01:10:23.091]  Guess what, when they did that raid on the polygamous a month ago, guess what was on the side of the tank that the local police went in?
[01:10:23.091 --> 01:10:25.052]  How many people they'd killed.
[01:10:25.052 --> 01:10:30.215]  Like in World War II, tankers would put how many tanks they'd destroy on the side, or you know, you'd put on the side of your
[01:10:31.593 --> 01:10:42.736]  Mustang, P-38 or whatever, you'd put on the side of your plane, on the side of your B-17, how many other planes you'd shot down, or how many bombing runs you've done, how many missions.
[01:10:42.736 --> 01:10:51.638]  Well now, when they kill one of us, the slaves, now they put a dead person, a symbol of a human, on the side of the tank.
[01:10:51.638 --> 01:10:54.218]  I mean, we're far gone, folks.
[01:10:54.218 --> 01:10:56.239]  The state sees us as the enemy, and we are.
[01:10:56.239 --> 01:10:56.939]  We're the food.
[01:10:57.902 --> 01:11:04.507]  Uh, we're here to be fed on by the private corporate structure and the public's so dumb, the corporate elites say, hey, they deserve it!
[01:11:04.507 --> 01:11:06.928]  So, okay, fine.
[01:11:06.928 --> 01:11:09.310]  Uh, let's go ahead here and go back to George.
[01:11:09.310 --> 01:11:13.453]  George, you were saying you were gonna flee the state before they kidnap your children?
[01:11:13.453 --> 01:11:14.794]  Uh, yes, I got two boys.
[01:11:14.794 --> 01:11:17.776]  Uh, we're thinking about going to Montana or Oklahoma.
[01:11:17.776 --> 01:11:26.882]  Well, yeah, I mean, if you're, the first time your son falls off a merry-go-round and breaks a finger or falls out of a tree, it doesn't matter how many witnesses you've got, you will have, and I'm not kidding, pedophiles at your house.
[01:11:28.564 --> 01:11:33.927]  And, uh, the thing is, I talked, you know, people in Florida are so pathetic, I want to watch their sobriety checkpoint.
[01:11:33.927 --> 01:11:39.731]  And there are days when people are just, like, begging the cops, can I please lick your boots before you, uh, kick me in the head or something like that?
[01:11:39.731 --> 01:11:42.152]  Land of the cowards, home of the slaves, yep.
[01:11:42.152 --> 01:11:46.215]  Yeah, I mean, I wish I could have heard Officer Jack Boot Thug, you know.
[01:11:46.215 --> 01:11:52.198]  But they're keeping you safe from the liquor, that's why they now build liquor stores the size of Walmarts.
[01:11:52.198 --> 01:11:58.142]  Here in Austin, well, one's in Kyle, I was driving by this thing, it was as big as a Super Walmart, a liquor store.
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:02.761]  I mean, this is a sick joke, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:02.761 --> 01:12:03.541]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:12:03.541 --> 01:12:05.282]  That's Spex, the old Academy.
[01:12:05.282 --> 01:12:07.802]  That's a third the size.
[01:12:07.802 --> 01:12:11.163]  It's like some psychopathic rabbit with bloodshot eyes.
[01:12:11.163 --> 01:12:15.724]  It's like the Trix rabbit, but he's the liquor rabbit.
[01:12:15.724 --> 01:12:16.184]  No, no, no, no.
[01:12:16.184 --> 01:12:18.485]  I'm not talking about that down there in South Austin.
[01:12:18.485 --> 01:12:22.045]  I mean, down in Kyle, they got one the size of an aircraft carrier.
[01:12:22.045 --> 01:12:24.066]  I mean, it makes that one look like a Mini Mart.
[01:12:24.066 --> 01:12:24.486]  I'm sorry.
[01:12:24.486 --> 01:12:25.986]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:12:25.986 --> 01:12:28.247]  Yes, it is just like I like to say.
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:30.181]  The people that are like cattle.
[01:12:30.181 --> 01:12:36.747]  I mean, you know the thing is, I might tell people about the CPS situation, like, well, I got enough money and enough guard dog lawyers around.
[01:12:36.747 --> 01:12:41.351]  I was like, well, the guard dog lawyers will cower under this family judge.
[01:12:41.351 --> 01:12:43.573]  I mean... I hear you, and it's not a real court.
[01:12:43.573 --> 01:12:44.774]  It's not a real court.
[01:12:44.774 --> 01:12:47.877]  They just, there's no due process, no nothing.
[01:12:47.877 --> 01:12:48.738]  It's all far gone.
[01:12:48.738 --> 01:12:50.119]  You're all going to find out though soon.
[01:12:50.119 --> 01:12:51.980]  Just keep laughing, everybody.
[01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:52.661]  Let's go ahead.
[01:12:52.661 --> 01:12:54.743]  I've gotten kind of to a sick, cynical point where
[01:12:55.293 --> 01:12:57.454]  Just, you know, you don't think they're devaluing your dollar?
[01:12:57.454 --> 01:12:58.875]  You like the New World Order?
[01:12:58.875 --> 01:13:00.035]  Fine, enjoy it.
[01:13:00.035 --> 01:13:01.316]  Carl in Montreal, Canada.
[01:13:01.316 --> 01:13:02.836]  You're on the air.
[01:13:02.836 --> 01:13:04.657]  Hey, thank you for taking my call.
[01:13:04.657 --> 01:13:09.579]  I was reading a scripture in the Bible today about how the wicked scheme against the righteous.
[01:13:09.579 --> 01:13:14.461]  You know, but the Bible says the Lord's gonna laugh at him before God sees his day is coming.
[01:13:14.461 --> 01:13:17.182]  You know, I believe they're gonna get what's coming to them.
[01:13:17.182 --> 01:13:18.423]  They think it's all funny now.
[01:13:19.345 --> 01:13:24.927]  Well, the Bible also says they invent all manner of wickedness.
[01:13:24.927 --> 01:13:27.148]  They're inventors of wickedness and evil.
[01:13:27.148 --> 01:13:35.230]  I mean, they think up complex new scams, and they always have idiots that serve them who mean well.
[01:13:35.230 --> 01:13:38.511]  Yeah, but it says in the Bible, also in Psalm 59, some good news.
[01:13:38.511 --> 01:13:40.992]  They'll be caught in their own pride, you know?
[01:13:41.570 --> 01:13:43.514]  I feel totally pathetic, upset, sad.
[01:13:43.514 --> 01:13:44.215]  It's a beautiful day.
[01:13:44.215 --> 01:13:45.678]  So many great things in life, but meanwhile...
[01:13:52.111 --> 01:13:56.294]  Everybody has this feeling of anxiousness, and the government says, that's Al Qaeda.
[01:13:56.294 --> 01:13:57.415]  You're scared of Al Qaeda.
[01:13:57.415 --> 01:13:58.015]  No.
[01:13:58.015 --> 01:14:02.038]  They know that we have legitimate sixth sense, and they know we have a legitimate fear.
[01:14:02.038 --> 01:14:12.545]  You don't feel safe, and you feel like something is bad, because when great evil is in control of your life, and in control of your country and your society, you're supposed to have that disquieted feeling, folks.
[01:14:22.406 --> 01:14:25.108]  You know, I come to Canada from the United States.
[01:14:25.108 --> 01:14:26.509]  I just went through hell there.
[01:14:26.509 --> 01:14:36.037]  You know, I was in prison, and I had evidence to show, you know, what happened was alive, what I was jailed on, and they don't even want to hear it yet.
[01:14:36.037 --> 01:14:42.502]  Exactly, and the average person who goes into the criminal justice system, and it is a criminal system for the human resources they feed on,
[01:14:43.370 --> 01:14:45.852]  You know, the average poor buck-toothed white trash.
[01:14:45.852 --> 01:14:48.113]  He's like, I don't understand!
[01:14:48.113 --> 01:14:51.115]  I didn't really do nothing!
[01:14:51.115 --> 01:14:55.579]  I just was late to class when I was twelve and I never got out of the system!
[01:14:55.579 --> 01:14:58.561]  I don't understand!
[01:14:58.561 --> 01:15:00.182]  The government isn't your friend!
[01:15:00.182 --> 01:15:02.183]  People always say, the government's dumb!
[01:15:02.183 --> 01:15:04.305]  They sent me to jail and I'm innocent!
[01:15:04.305 --> 01:15:06.286]  They're not dumb!
[01:15:06.286 --> 01:15:10.209]  The narcotics traffickers own the banks and own the private prisons!
[01:15:10.209 --> 01:15:11.149]  They run things!
[01:15:11.149 --> 01:15:11.790]  They're smart!
[01:15:12.833 --> 01:15:14.093]  You're dumb.
[01:15:14.093 --> 01:15:15.794]  That's why they've enslaved you.
[01:15:15.794 --> 01:15:17.334]  I'm serious, folks.
[01:15:17.334 --> 01:15:18.175]  I hate the New World Order.
[01:15:18.175 --> 01:15:22.876]  I hate the things they do, but it's time for you to stop being such easy pushovers.
[01:15:22.876 --> 01:15:23.516]  Look at the public.
[01:15:23.516 --> 01:15:24.937]  They're lambs of the slaughter, folks.
[01:15:24.937 --> 01:15:30.038]  If you had any idea how evil the globalists are.
[01:15:30.038 --> 01:15:31.499]  More of your calls straight ahead.
[01:15:31.499 --> 01:15:35.760]  It's Happy Sunday Radio Show.
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:36.320]  Stay with us.
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:37.821]  If you disagree, we'll put you to the head of the line.
[01:15:37.821 --> 01:15:38.361]  877-590-5525 and fullwars.com.
[01:15:50.554 --> 01:15:51.975]  It is a big idea.
[01:15:51.975 --> 01:15:54.777]  A New World Order.
[01:15:54.777 --> 01:15:59.660]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:15:59.660 --> 01:16:02.502]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:16:02.502 --> 01:16:05.304]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:16:05.304 --> 01:16:08.487]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:16:08.487 --> 01:16:15.812]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:16:18.837 --> 01:16:24.279]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:16:24.279 --> 01:16:28.141]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:16:28.141 --> 01:16:30.701]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:16:30.701 --> 01:16:31.862]  Most people have no idea.
[01:16:31.862 --> 01:16:32.662]  They're not after money.
[01:16:32.662 --> 01:16:33.923]  They have all the money they need.
[01:16:33.923 --> 01:16:34.923]  They're after power.
[01:16:34.923 --> 01:16:36.063]  That's what they're after.
[01:16:36.063 --> 01:16:40.245]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[01:16:49.255 --> 01:16:50.036]  Gold.
[01:16:50.036 --> 01:16:51.557]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:16:51.557 --> 01:16:57.844]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:16:57.844 --> 01:17:01.649]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:17:02.009 --> 01:17:03.950]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:17:03.950 --> 01:17:06.372]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:17:06.372 --> 01:17:14.477]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[01:17:14.477 --> 01:17:20.921]  Midas Resources is proud to offer the hard-hitting report that arms you with the truth you need to protect you and your family.
[01:17:20.981 --> 01:17:21.221]  I think so.
[01:17:50.305 --> 01:17:52.826]  Hi, this is Dave from Ready Reserve Foods.
[01:17:52.826 --> 01:18:00.187]  I have been waiting patiently for the government and mainstream media to inform you of what is turning out to be the biggest problem facing the world in the last 50 years.
[01:18:00.187 --> 01:18:05.788]  For the last three years, the Earth has consumed more food than it has been able to produce, and it has now finally caught up with us.
[01:18:05.788 --> 01:18:12.710]  In the U.S., commodities such as flour and rice are already being rationed, and the next rice crop won't be available for another four to five months.
[01:18:12.710 --> 01:18:19.331]  It's fall in the Southern Hemisphere, and many countries are short the food necessary to make it through the winter and have stopped exporting certain commodities altogether.
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:21.701]  Remember our trade deficit?
[01:18:21.701 --> 01:18:27.564]  Trillions of dollars have stacked up outside the country and are now rushing in to buy our food production at any price.
[01:18:27.564 --> 01:18:33.946]  By late summer, if not early fall, it is likely our government will step in and control food and food exports under martial law.

[01:20:27.868 --> 01:20:30.731]  I'm going to try to rampage through your calls as quickly as I can.
[01:20:30.731 --> 01:20:35.755]  Then we're going to come back and go over Clinton's assassination comment about Barack Obama.
[01:20:35.755 --> 01:20:37.736]  Just unbelievable.
[01:20:37.736 --> 01:20:41.319]  Bunch of other really important news I have here in front of me.
[01:20:41.319 --> 01:20:44.882]  Let's go ahead and talk to Stephen in New York.
[01:20:44.882 --> 01:20:45.743]  You're on the air.
[01:20:45.743 --> 01:20:46.123]  Go ahead.
[01:20:46.937 --> 01:20:57.445]  Hey, um, I saw this article you wrote about, um, not, not you wrote, you posted about, um, the birth of the South American Union, and I'd like to make a couple of points about Hugo Chavez.
[01:20:57.445 --> 01:21:10.734]  It seems that, um, he's being used to put in some sort of neo-socialist track to get, and get the rest of South America along with the, for the South American Union.
[01:21:10.734 --> 01:21:12.956]  Um, they knew that, um,
[01:21:14.059 --> 01:21:23.104]  That the people of North and South America would not easily accept a whole gigantic area of the Americas.
[01:21:24.935 --> 01:21:30.276]  All gigantic, um, super state of North and South America.
[01:21:30.276 --> 01:21:33.757]  So they, um, got him to kill the F.T.A.A.
[01:21:33.757 --> 01:21:36.278]  and, um, wait a couple of years.
[01:21:36.278 --> 01:21:39.939]  Because the Illuminati, they're masters of deception, masters of cloak and dagger.
[01:21:39.939 --> 01:21:45.600]  No, I mean, in fact, I believe, and I've said this, that they staged his kidnapping in 2002.
[01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:47.600]  Greg Palast even knew it was going to happen.
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:50.021]  Said it, like, three weeks before it happened on my show.
[01:21:50.021 --> 01:21:52.922]  Uh, you know, he'd heard rumblings of it.
[01:21:52.922 --> 01:21:53.762]  BBC reporter.
[01:21:54.577 --> 01:22:02.063]  And certainly, and then now he's helped spearhead their separate socialist South American Union.
[01:22:02.063 --> 01:22:04.185]  And yeah, they've publicly celebrated it.
[01:22:04.185 --> 01:22:09.589]  British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, visiting during the founding of it, calls the new global covenant.
[01:22:09.589 --> 01:22:21.939]  The founding members of the South American Union are Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, Venezuela, reports Sophie News Agency.
[01:22:23.383 --> 01:22:26.825]  And it's the new Union of South American States.
[01:22:26.825 --> 01:22:33.630]  But you tell an American that, they go, there's no such thing, does not exist, because my media says the globalists aren't moving for that.
[01:22:33.630 --> 01:22:42.497]  Yeah, and he said that the biggest enemy of the South American Union was the evil American Empire.
[01:22:42.497 --> 01:22:43.298]  Can you believe that?
[01:22:43.298 --> 01:22:44.439]  Yeah, the U.S.
[01:22:44.439 --> 01:22:46.921]  Well, I mean, the globalists use us as the front.
[01:22:46.921 --> 01:22:49.723]  The globalists blame us, the globalists act like the U.S.
[01:22:49.723 --> 01:22:49.783]  is
[01:22:50.203 --> 01:22:53.724]  Doing all of this when we're just the muscle, and then we get the blame.
[01:22:53.724 --> 01:22:55.104]  We're birdcage liner.
[01:22:55.104 --> 01:22:58.485]  We take all the heat, then they just remove us and wad us up.
[01:22:58.485 --> 01:23:06.668]  Yeah, um, I actually wrote an article about this, and, um, it goes over all the points, and it's, and, um... Okay, where is it?
[01:23:06.668 --> 01:23:09.208]  Um, warofillusions.wordpress.com.
[01:23:09.208 --> 01:23:14.450]  It's called, um, the South American Union and Hugo Chavez.
[01:23:14.450 --> 01:23:15.790]  Okay, great.
[01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:16.550]  Thank you.
[01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:19.331]  Why don't you post it on the Prison Planet forum, and we might post it on
[01:23:19.793 --> 01:23:20.494]  One of our sites.
[01:23:20.494 --> 01:23:21.694]  Thank you, sir.
[01:23:21.694 --> 01:23:25.377]  And I keep being sarcastic all day, saying this doesn't exist, that doesn't exist.
[01:23:25.377 --> 01:23:33.503]  I get emails and calls and people saying there's no inflation, there's no hyperinflation, and the dollar's strong, and you just hate America.
[01:23:33.503 --> 01:23:42.370]  And I'm like, no, the people running our government have had policies to devalue it, cutting the interest rates and all of this, and it's just denial.
[01:23:42.370 --> 01:23:44.531]  Denial gets you in deep trouble, folks.
[01:23:44.531 --> 01:23:45.973]  It's time to stop denying.
[01:23:45.973 --> 01:23:49.095]  We have a criminal, world government, militarizing the police,
[01:23:49.656 --> 01:23:55.599]  Turning our country into a third world cesspit, and our basic fundamental rights are being scrapped.
[01:23:55.599 --> 01:23:57.920]  That ought to scare the daylights out of you.
[01:23:57.920 --> 01:23:59.681]  Tyranny is serious business.
[01:23:59.681 --> 01:24:01.302]  I gotta move quick here, man.
[01:24:01.302 --> 01:24:04.324]  Everybody sounds like they're stoned.
[01:24:04.324 --> 01:24:06.785]  I'm back on that whole rant there.
[01:24:06.785 --> 01:24:11.948]  By the way, I'm not letting out some secret that, oh, I'd seen Joe Rogan smoke pot, and I'm ratting out one of my friends.
[01:24:11.948 --> 01:24:16.410]  I was in a comedy TV show, and they were gonna shoot a scene, and I was with Joe Rogan.
[01:24:16.410 --> 01:24:18.291]  He said, hey, wanna be in this little TV piece?
[01:24:18.291 --> 01:24:19.192]  I said, sure, I'll come down.
[01:24:20.194 --> 01:24:25.416]  He was visiting here in Austin, and then he starts smoking pot on camera for the scene.
[01:24:25.416 --> 01:24:29.178]  I'm like, hey man, I don't really like marijuana.
[01:24:29.178 --> 01:24:30.338]  It's like, hey, want some?
[01:24:30.338 --> 01:24:33.300]  And I'm like, no, I don't want that, and it ended up being on the TV show.
[01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:34.660]  So, no secret.
[01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:36.341]  Somebody's like on the message board going, what are you doing?
[01:24:36.341 --> 01:24:37.821]  I'm talking about how you smoke pot with him.
[01:24:37.821 --> 01:24:39.242]  I don't smoke pot.
[01:24:39.242 --> 01:24:40.122]  I don't cocaine.
[01:24:40.122 --> 01:24:44.504]  It's one of the only drugs the government doesn't ship in, but I still don't smoke it because I don't like it.
[01:24:44.504 --> 01:24:48.486]  Let's go ahead and talk to Peter in Colorado.
[01:24:49.093 --> 01:24:51.034]  Peter, you are on the air.
[01:24:51.034 --> 01:24:52.255]  Welcome.
[01:24:52.255 --> 01:24:55.398]  How dare you say 9-11 was an inside job?
[01:24:55.398 --> 01:24:57.959]  How dare you?
[01:24:57.959 --> 01:24:58.500]  I'm sorry?
[01:24:58.500 --> 01:24:59.841]  How dare you?
[01:24:59.841 --> 01:25:00.441]  Okay, I hear you.
[01:25:00.441 --> 01:25:03.563]  How dare you say that?
[01:25:03.563 --> 01:25:06.526]  Is this a joke?
[01:25:06.526 --> 01:25:09.588]  How dare you say 9-11 was an inside job?
[01:25:09.588 --> 01:25:12.090]  How dare you say we didn't land on the moon?
[01:25:12.090 --> 01:25:15.212]  How dare you say 9-11 was an inside job?
[01:25:15.212 --> 01:25:16.693]  How dare you?
[01:25:16.693 --> 01:25:17.534]  Is that all you can say?
[01:25:19.057 --> 01:25:22.939]  You like pull a string out and then it says it over and over again?
[01:25:22.939 --> 01:25:25.260]  How dare you say 9-11 was an incident?
[01:25:25.260 --> 01:25:33.143]  You're a fucking nigger, man!
[01:25:33.143 --> 01:25:38.065]  I thought that call was a joke from Colorado.
[01:25:38.065 --> 01:25:43.768]  We had to delay it out and then he started screaming the N-word and calling me that.
[01:25:43.768 --> 01:25:46.269]  Just, just, just, just absolutely amazing.
[01:25:47.682 --> 01:25:49.603]  Listen, troglodyte, don't worry.
[01:25:49.603 --> 01:25:52.504]  The people you think are your government are going to betray you.
[01:25:52.504 --> 01:25:57.206]  The corrupt, fake system you worship is a fraud and is lying to you.
[01:25:57.206 --> 01:25:58.967]  Number one, I believe we went to the moon.
[01:25:58.967 --> 01:26:01.708]  He also tried to mix that in.
[01:26:01.708 --> 01:26:05.890]  He would just say, how dare you say 9-11 wasn't an inside job?
[01:26:05.890 --> 01:26:14.153]  And then, he then started cussing.
[01:26:14.153 --> 01:26:15.514]  Just absolutely amazing.
[01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:21.781]  I've also had these guys email me and say how dare me say our government staged the Gulf of Tonkin.
[01:26:21.781 --> 01:26:23.942]  That's now declassified.
[01:26:23.942 --> 01:26:34.325]  It's now been the Chicago Tribune and declassified that Israel attacked USS Liberty knowing it was a USS ship to try to sink it so the US would attack Egypt and the Soviet Union.
[01:26:34.325 --> 01:26:36.465]  Nuclear bombers were in the air.
[01:26:36.465 --> 01:26:38.646]  B-52s to nuke Russia.
[01:26:39.329 --> 01:26:51.159]  That's now all been declassified, years after I had the admirals and all the different people who were involved on, to tell you it's now the NSA documents have now been released, what, six months ago.
[01:26:51.159 --> 01:26:55.422]  Yes, the people running our government killed 3,000 people on 9-11.
[01:26:55.422 --> 01:26:57.864]  Let me try to explain something to you.
[01:26:57.864 --> 01:27:07.752]  It's in the news that our government is using real Al-Qaeda, the number two and number three of Al-Qaeda, Wahhabi, out of Saudi Arabia, to attack Shiite Iran.
[01:27:08.490 --> 01:27:11.972]  And that they're blowing up mosques, police stations, schools.
[01:27:11.972 --> 01:27:21.197]  And that Iran is now trying to get extradition to Iran of Saudi Arabian bombers, and the U.S.
[01:27:21.197 --> 01:27:22.638]  is protecting them.
[01:27:22.638 --> 01:27:23.358]  Okay?
[01:27:23.358 --> 01:27:26.360]  The people that run our country, we shouldn't even say the U.S.
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:31.403]  People that use our name, use our troops, use our country, they created al-Qaeda.
[01:27:31.403 --> 01:27:33.584]  The British created them about 80 years ago.
[01:27:33.584 --> 01:27:37.266]  Then they used them against the Soviets, started the war with them, got the Soviets to come in.
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:40.881]  Contrary to Tom Hanks' stupid movie.
[01:27:40.881 --> 01:27:44.001]  The folks that, by the way, ran that operation live right here in Austin.
[01:27:44.001 --> 01:27:50.543]  I don't even know one time I was invited to a dinner and then I was suddenly at a dinner with these people and I was totally freaked me out.
[01:27:50.543 --> 01:27:56.264]  They weren't evil people to eat dinner with on the surface, but... I already digress, it doesn't even matter.
[01:27:56.264 --> 01:27:59.024]  I mean, I mean that guy who called in going, HELL DARE YOU!
[01:27:59.024 --> 01:28:00.245]  HELL DARE YOU!
[01:28:00.245 --> 01:28:01.825]  I thought it was a joke.
[01:28:01.825 --> 01:28:04.205]  And I was like, come on, can you say more?
[01:28:04.205 --> 01:28:06.766]  And then he started threatening and cussing and screaming, you...
[01:28:07.501 --> 01:28:09.683]  Effing, you know, N-word.
[01:28:09.683 --> 01:28:12.325]  Well, that isn't an insult to me to call me a black person.
[01:28:12.325 --> 01:28:15.108]  I mean, I'm not black, but I know to you, you thought that really hurt me.
[01:28:15.108 --> 01:28:16.248]  You think I'm like you.
[01:28:16.248 --> 01:28:17.810]  Hates black people.
[01:28:17.810 --> 01:28:20.112]  Look, you... You think you're patriotic.
[01:28:20.112 --> 01:28:22.033]  You think you're saving this country.
[01:28:22.033 --> 01:28:22.414]  You're not.
[01:28:22.414 --> 01:28:23.294]  Okay?
[01:28:23.294 --> 01:28:25.857]  You've been betrayed.
[01:28:25.857 --> 01:28:28.439]  They used Al-Qaeda to attack Serbia.
[01:28:28.439 --> 01:28:30.060]  They're using Al-Qaeda to attack Iran.
[01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:34.084]  Al-Qaeda is a pocket weapon that the globalists pull out and use.
[01:28:34.084 --> 01:28:35.725]  They radicalize the Muslims.
[01:28:36.837 --> 01:28:41.639]  Pre and post-World War II to take down secular governments in the Middle East.
[01:28:41.639 --> 01:28:43.500]  Al-Qaeda works for the globalists.
[01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:44.161]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:44.161 --> 01:28:44.561]  Stay with us.
[01:28:50.313 --> 01:28:54.737]  Prepare for an uncertain future with DVDs from the winner of 13 Telly Awards.
[01:28:54.737 --> 01:28:58.180]  Hoods Woods is the world leader in survival instructional videos.
[01:28:58.180 --> 01:29:01.802]  Hoods Woods produces an outstanding collection of survival DVDs.
[01:29:01.802 --> 01:29:08.468]  From cave cooking to survival basics to home survival DVDs covering topics such as food storage and home emergency planning.
[01:29:08.468 --> 01:29:12.691]  You will learn survival techniques for use in the wild and in your very own home.
[01:29:12.691 --> 01:29:16.154]  Used by scouts, the military, and families around the world.
[01:29:16.154 --> 01:29:19.497]  If you would like to learn more about survival, trapping, cave cooking, navigating,
[01:29:19.497 --> 01:29:19.737]  We're good.
[01:29:50.458 --> 01:29:51.740]  Why should we fire Congress?
[01:29:51.740 --> 01:29:55.365]  Because they use the Constitution of the United States as a scrap of paper.
[01:29:55.365 --> 01:29:57.668]  They swear an oath to follow it, and then they reject it.
[01:29:57.668 --> 01:30:00.492]  That was their employment document.
[01:30:00.492 --> 01:30:01.553]  They haven't followed it.
[01:30:01.553 --> 01:30:03.435]  Congressmen, Senators, you're fired.
[01:30:03.435 --> 01:30:05.158]  Washington, you're fired!
[01:30:05.418 --> 01:30:07.339]  I think it's the next freedom to fascism.
[01:30:07.339 --> 01:30:14.241]  Washington You're Fired was born out of sheer frustration with abuses in our current political system and it gives a voice to Americans across the country.
[01:30:14.241 --> 01:30:27.505]  Washington You're Fired examines constitutional issues as they relate to the Katrina disaster, the president's illegal spy program, NSA data mining, FISA's secret court, the illegal wiretapping of millions of Americans, and the last seven years of terror-related spy bills.
[01:30:27.805 --> 01:30:30.287]  How they affect you and what you can do about it.
[01:30:30.287 --> 01:30:34.670]  Washington You're Fired captures the spirit and zest of an old-fashioned Boston tea party.
[01:30:34.670 --> 01:30:38.513]  Kem Williams describes the film as a rabble-rousing call to arms.
[01:30:38.513 --> 01:30:40.395]  We invite you to make the change with us.
[01:30:40.395 --> 01:30:41.976]  Help take back our government now.

[01:30:50.262 --> 01:30:55.785]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:30:55.785 --> 01:31:00.828]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for the American empire instead of what's fair for the American people.
[01:31:00.828 --> 01:31:06.731]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism, which is why you should be reading the Nationalist Times each month.

[01:32:13.106 --> 01:32:17.212]  The silver band with gold terminals is still the most popular and a bestseller.
[01:32:17.212 --> 01:32:24.081]  The balance bracelet has no magnets, but is ionized in such a way that wearers are so delighted they refuse to ever take theirs off.

[01:33:09.645 --> 01:33:13.468]  Corruption never had a worse enemy.
[01:33:13.468 --> 01:33:15.690]  You're locked into the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:18.015 --> 01:33:21.476]  Let me just read a bunch of headlines and we're going to go back to your calls and into more of the news.
[01:33:21.476 --> 01:33:21.936]  Look at this.
[01:33:21.936 --> 01:33:26.937]  South American Union of Nations established in Brazil.
[01:33:26.937 --> 01:33:29.938]  Okay, that's just a headline.
[01:33:29.938 --> 01:33:33.819]  Oil climbs to record above 135 a gallon.
[01:33:33.819 --> 01:33:35.099]  Denton County.
[01:33:35.099 --> 01:33:41.141]  No refusal weekend targets drunk drivers jamming needles in your arms on the side of the road.
[01:33:41.141 --> 01:33:45.582]  Massive surveillance program the federal government's conducting on eight million potential suspects.
[01:33:46.141 --> 01:33:48.483]  Now it's 8 million, I guess, in the terror database.
[01:33:48.483 --> 01:33:49.984]  We're all terrorists.
[01:33:49.984 --> 01:33:51.004]  It's just ridiculous.
[01:33:51.004 --> 01:33:58.830]  A researcher, famine killed 7 million people in the United States during the Great Depression.
[01:33:58.830 --> 01:34:02.232]  And that's when 90% of people lived on farms.
[01:34:02.232 --> 01:34:06.074]  Now think about a breakdown in society.
[01:34:06.074 --> 01:34:07.335]  Here's another one.
[01:34:07.335 --> 01:34:10.077]  Texas, FLDS case rejected.
[01:34:10.077 --> 01:34:12.599]  Simply no evidence that says that the CPS
[01:34:13.137 --> 01:34:17.538]  Had no evidence on any of the people that they falsely arrested and the children they took.
[01:34:17.538 --> 01:34:18.078]  Doesn't matter.
[01:34:18.078 --> 01:34:21.119]  Those criminals will still have their way with those children.
[01:34:21.119 --> 01:34:23.220]  They're still going to harass the living daylights out of them.
[01:34:23.220 --> 01:34:24.660]  They do what they want, when they want.
[01:34:24.660 --> 01:34:28.161]  There's no group more dangerous for children to be in the custody of than government.
[01:34:28.161 --> 01:34:29.281]  Justice Department numbers.
[01:34:29.281 --> 01:34:36.223]  Five times more likely to be abused in CPS custody than any other place.
[01:34:36.223 --> 01:34:39.024]  They're even safer in juvenile hall when they're older.
[01:34:39.841 --> 01:34:41.503]  That's just the facts.
[01:34:41.503 --> 01:34:42.744]  Government is scum.
[01:34:42.744 --> 01:34:43.665]  Government is filth.
[01:34:43.665 --> 01:34:45.146]  Government is trash.
[01:34:45.146 --> 01:34:46.828]  On average.
[01:34:46.828 --> 01:34:54.935]  I mean, you know, in a latrine, could you stick your hand out in there and maybe find somebody's wedding ring that fell off?
[01:34:54.935 --> 01:34:56.937]  I mean, maybe a diamond fell in the latrine?
[01:34:56.937 --> 01:34:59.720]  I'm not saying there might not be some good people in government.
[01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:01.021]  But in these key areas.
[01:35:01.363 --> 01:35:06.607]  A normal person doesn't want to go snatch kids and abuse people and taser people and have power.
[01:35:06.607 --> 01:35:08.788]  Whack jobs want that on average.
[01:35:08.788 --> 01:35:10.990]  So we got whack jobs running our society.
[01:35:10.990 --> 01:35:14.952]  And frankly, I'm just sick of all of you!
[01:35:14.952 --> 01:35:28.742]  And I know it's upsetting Neocon listeners today that everything I've said is coming true and you're starting to realize that they're devaluing your dollar and raping you at the gas pump and that the New World Order is real and it's very upsetting for you right now.
[01:35:30.849 --> 01:35:31.590]  This story.
[01:35:31.590 --> 01:35:35.413]  Clinton apologizes for RFK assassination remark.
[01:35:35.413 --> 01:35:37.054]  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[01:35:37.054 --> 01:35:39.956]  I mean if I ever have to look at that woman again, it'll be too soon.
[01:35:39.956 --> 01:35:42.478]  Quickly apologized Friday after her death threat.
[01:35:42.478 --> 01:35:43.699]  I'm sorry.
[01:35:43.699 --> 01:35:53.466]  After citing the June 68 assassination of Robert F. Kennedy and defending her decision to keep running for the Democratic presidential nomination despite increasing long odds.
[01:35:54.966 --> 01:36:02.071]  And yeah, she said I better not give up because, you know, Kennedy got killed in June and that could happen to Obama.
[01:36:02.071 --> 01:36:05.073]  Thank God she didn't deny that's what she meant by it.
[01:36:05.073 --> 01:36:10.496]  But don't worry all the racists out there who hate Obama and hate black people and are really freaked out.
[01:36:10.496 --> 01:36:24.786]  I mean, you notice all the white trash bevies out there in the country or, you know, hardline yellow dog Democrats that want mailbox money, welfare money, are all voting against Barack Obama and all these liberal strongholds.
[01:36:25.646 --> 01:36:28.388]  Don't worry, he doesn't run anything.
[01:36:28.388 --> 01:36:31.031]  I mean, Bush doesn't run anything.
[01:36:31.031 --> 01:36:32.912]  McCain, Hillary, it doesn't matter.
[01:36:32.912 --> 01:36:34.854]  Don't you understand they're puppets?
[01:36:34.854 --> 01:36:37.196]  Don't you get that the country's bankrupt?
[01:36:37.196 --> 01:36:39.638]  Don't you understand they've built FEMA camps?
[01:36:39.638 --> 01:36:43.121]  Don't you understand we're entering a long, dark night of the republic?
[01:36:43.121 --> 01:36:47.005]  You've had your way, America.
[01:36:47.005 --> 01:36:52.149]  Your ignorance has brought us to hell and back.
[01:36:52.149 --> 01:36:52.630]  Oh, God.
[01:36:55.489 --> 01:36:57.150]  They're all bad.
[01:36:57.150 --> 01:36:59.452]  I wouldn't vote for either one of them.
[01:36:59.452 --> 01:37:06.897]  Why do we get 60% turnout for presidential races, and then 8% turnout for local, where the real power's at?
[01:37:06.897 --> 01:37:11.201]  Because the media gives you a spectacle, gives you the false left-right choice.
[01:37:11.201 --> 01:37:15.944]  It's like, you want me to punch you in the face with my left hand, or my right hand?
[01:37:15.944 --> 01:37:18.446]  Tell you what, let's just get Paul in here in studio.
[01:37:18.446 --> 01:37:21.168]  Paul, come in here, I'm gonna ask you on camera.
[01:37:21.168 --> 01:37:21.908]  Come right over here.
[01:37:21.908 --> 01:37:24.030]  You want me to slap you with my left hand or my right hand?
[01:37:25.748 --> 01:37:27.749]  Really?
[01:37:27.749 --> 01:37:29.429]  Trey?
[01:37:29.429 --> 01:37:31.050]  Trey, can I have a choice?
[01:37:31.050 --> 01:37:34.071]  Paul, you can punch me with your left or right hand.
[01:37:34.071 --> 01:37:35.792]  That's a choice.
[01:37:35.792 --> 01:37:39.293]  Or how about you can shoot me in the head with your left hand or your right hand?
[01:37:39.293 --> 01:37:42.894]  The hands are attached to arms that are attached to the New World Order.
[01:37:42.894 --> 01:37:46.556]  What, are you going to say something, Trey?
[01:37:46.556 --> 01:37:49.397]  No, I was just saying I'd take the left.
[01:37:49.397 --> 01:37:50.397]  Well, yeah, statistically.
[01:37:50.397 --> 01:37:52.258]  But let's say the arms were both the same size.
[01:37:54.113 --> 01:37:56.655]  Oh God, I'm like a fiddler crab like everybody else.
[01:37:56.655 --> 01:38:00.057]  Alright, one arm's bigger than the other, it doesn't even matter.
[01:38:00.057 --> 01:38:02.338]  Some days I come in here, I mean, look at this news I've got.
[01:38:02.338 --> 01:38:04.439]  Just, just, just look.
[01:38:04.439 --> 01:38:08.162]  Bilderberg luminaries as select Obama's running mate.
[01:38:08.162 --> 01:38:10.703]  Dutch embassy, deep sixes, Bilderberg information.
[01:38:10.703 --> 01:38:15.786]  They'd posted where their prime minister was going and pulled it off their presidential site.
[01:38:15.786 --> 01:38:16.667]  Oh man.
[01:38:16.667 --> 01:38:23.131]  Uh, Pennsylvania turnpike on verge of 75-year lease to Spanish company, same one taking over our roads, to toll road operator.
[01:38:23.922 --> 01:38:27.984]  The $12.8 billion offer may see another piece of U.S.
[01:38:27.984 --> 01:38:30.025]  sold off to foreign investors.
[01:38:30.025 --> 01:38:37.409]  And it turns out they're getting a 75-year lease when this is only the amount of money they'll make in the next 10 years.
[01:38:37.409 --> 01:38:39.550]  Saying that's a bad business deal.
[01:38:39.550 --> 01:38:41.130]  But see, it's all strip mining.
[01:38:41.130 --> 01:38:42.951]  The politicians sell it off.
[01:38:42.951 --> 01:38:48.174]  They then get their daughters, their wives, their husbands, literally all get jobs with the company doing nothing.
[01:38:49.753 --> 01:38:51.294]  Mailbox money again?
[01:38:51.294 --> 01:38:52.834]  See, that's what's scary about government.
[01:38:52.834 --> 01:38:56.235]  They're all just grabbing, selling everything.
[01:38:56.235 --> 01:38:59.456]  I'd liken the country to a mansion.
[01:38:59.456 --> 01:39:14.281]  They've pulled out the carpet, and the drapes, and the furniture, and the paintings, and the fixtures, and now they're ripping out the marble floor, and ripping out the sinks, and ripping out the bathtubs, and ripping out the beams, and ripping out the flower planters.
[01:39:14.281 --> 01:39:19.203]  I mean, they're just looting it, while telling us it's all to stop Al-Qaeda, of course.
[01:39:21.067 --> 01:39:25.169]  Safety lapses raise risk in trailers for Katrina victims.
[01:39:25.169 --> 01:39:25.489]  U.S.
[01:39:25.489 --> 01:39:27.810]  residents and military brigs.
[01:39:27.810 --> 01:39:29.210]  Government says it's war.
[01:39:29.210 --> 01:39:32.212]  AP.
[01:39:32.212 --> 01:39:33.132]  Look at these headlines.
[01:39:33.132 --> 01:39:39.154]  CIA protects Al Qaeda group from extradition.
[01:39:39.154 --> 01:39:39.575]  Bush.
[01:39:39.575 --> 01:39:41.635]  Early Iraq withdrawal would be catastrophic.
[01:39:41.635 --> 01:39:43.036]  I thought we'd be out of there in six months.
[01:39:43.036 --> 01:39:43.936]  You promised.
[01:39:43.936 --> 01:39:45.497]  Oh, it's early to leave in six years.
[01:39:46.414 --> 01:39:48.736]  Fingerprint registry and housing bill.
[01:39:48.736 --> 01:39:54.180]  Notice how you hear all teachers got to be fingerprinted, and then all government workers have got to be thumb scanned to get in.
[01:39:54.180 --> 01:39:57.102]  And then, oh, now all realtors and anyone associated.
[01:39:57.102 --> 01:39:59.984]  That's federal!
[01:39:59.984 --> 01:40:00.704]  And isn't it funny?
[01:40:00.704 --> 01:40:03.426]  Texas passed a bill right before the feds did.
[01:40:03.426 --> 01:40:04.667]  See, it's all unified.
[01:40:04.667 --> 01:40:10.151]  They all get them up at the national associations of counties and cities and city managers, and it's all internet.
[01:40:10.151 --> 01:40:14.354]  The same stuff we do here, they do in Australia at the same time, because it's all globally run.
[01:40:15.478 --> 01:40:19.861]  Getting you ready to buy and sell with your thumbprint.
[01:40:19.861 --> 01:40:22.083]  Just wait.
[01:40:22.083 --> 01:40:25.426]  Fingerprint software integrated with medical marijuana dispensary.
[01:40:25.426 --> 01:40:27.487]  Oh, you want your marijuana dopeheads?
[01:40:27.487 --> 01:40:30.409]  You gotta be thumb scanned to get it.
[01:40:30.409 --> 01:40:34.552]  Employment verification plan triggers fears of Big Brother.
[01:40:34.552 --> 01:40:35.613]  McClatchy newspapers.
[01:40:35.613 --> 01:40:40.497]  And it goes on to say the feds are gonna make you have an ID that's biometrically scanned to have a job.
[01:40:41.118 --> 01:40:42.799]  But they say it'll stop illegals.
[01:40:42.799 --> 01:40:45.720]  But the illegals are going to be legalized under the guest worker.
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:46.720]  That's what that is.
[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:48.981]  We all go under this.
[01:40:48.981 --> 01:40:49.301]  You understand?
[01:40:49.301 --> 01:40:51.302]  They're not arresting the illegals, folks.
[01:40:51.302 --> 01:40:55.304]  They arrest a thousand here, a thousand there, out of four million that pour in each year.
[01:40:55.304 --> 01:40:59.045]  It's all dog and pony shows.
[01:40:59.045 --> 01:41:02.467]  NBC, Army Stop Loss Policy, a backdoor draft.
[01:41:02.467 --> 01:41:04.728]  No, it's a front door draft.
[01:41:04.728 --> 01:41:09.089]  You've already served three tours in Iraq, and they say, we're sending you back for a fourth.
[01:41:09.089 --> 01:41:10.830]  Doesn't matter if your papers say you're out.
[01:41:12.085 --> 01:41:15.027]  Spending on Iraq, poorly tracked.
[01:41:15.027 --> 01:41:16.328]  That's a funny way of saying it.
[01:41:16.328 --> 01:41:20.972]  Audit faults, accounting for $15 billion missing.
[01:41:20.972 --> 01:41:31.340]  Folks, the mainstream media always reports on things like trucks, beds, rocket-propelled grenades, machine guns, you know, low-level theft.
[01:41:31.340 --> 01:41:36.363]  Two days before 9-11, the AP reported $1.9 trillion missing from the Pentagon.
[01:41:36.363 --> 01:41:39.786]  You go, wait a minute, the whole Pentagon budget's $800 billion a year.
[01:41:39.786 --> 01:41:40.567]  At that time, $500 billion.
[01:41:41.468 --> 01:41:43.350]  How would there be trillions missing?
[01:41:43.350 --> 01:41:45.511]  All the pension funds, all the investments.
[01:41:45.511 --> 01:41:47.253]  It was all transferred out of the country.
[01:41:47.253 --> 01:41:48.454]  That's all the Pentagon says.
[01:41:48.454 --> 01:41:54.259]  And I've got video of Rumsfeld in front of Congress saying, I won't tell you where it is.
[01:41:54.259 --> 01:41:54.939]  Oh no!
[01:41:54.939 --> 01:41:57.161]  These guys aren't involved in any terrorism.
[01:41:57.161 --> 01:41:58.982]  There's just trillions missing.
[01:41:58.982 --> 01:42:01.685]  They just do whatever they want.
[01:42:01.685 --> 01:42:02.425]  Here's another one.
[01:42:02.425 --> 01:42:07.669]  Democrats seek Iraq embezzlement probe.
[01:42:07.669 --> 01:42:09.271]  Yeah, well, if the air...
[01:42:10.074 --> 01:42:18.480]  If the happy hooligans from North Dakota wouldn't have refused orders and shot down Flight 93, it was scheduled to go right into the Capitol.
[01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:21.342]  See, that would have shut the Capitol up real quick.
[01:42:21.342 --> 01:42:29.368]  Under Bush's continuity of government, he can just declare himself dictator, so can Obama, Hillary, any of the puppets, and that won't matter.
[01:42:29.368 --> 01:42:32.590]  Okay, I got a bunch of other news, but first we'll take calls.

[01:45:54.697 --> 01:45:56.718]  One child in 10 suffers from asthma.
[01:45:56.718 --> 01:45:58.480]  How can we improve the air we breathe?

[01:46:56.008 --> 01:46:57.289]  Well, search no more.
[01:46:57.289 --> 01:47:05.374]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:47:05.374 --> 01:47:14.360]  Yep, on this Memorial Day coming up tomorrow, remember that our veterans supposedly, they tell us, fought for liberty, freedom, due process, land of the free, home of the brave.
[01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:16.562]  Ask yourself, is that where we are now?
[01:47:16.562 --> 01:47:20.304]  We're a nation overrun by illegal aliens that hate this country, openly.
[01:47:23.186 --> 01:47:29.228]  There's a Mexican radio station in Austin called The Race.
[01:47:29.228 --> 01:47:30.229]  Yeah.
[01:47:30.229 --> 01:47:32.930]  Their motto is, for those inside the race, everything.
[01:47:32.930 --> 01:47:35.471]  For those outside the race, nothing.
[01:47:35.471 --> 01:47:37.312]  Our liberties are gone, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:47:37.312 --> 01:47:39.413]  This country is falling apart.
[01:47:39.413 --> 01:47:41.694]  And it's positive that I'm on air telling you that.
[01:47:41.694 --> 01:47:43.314]  We need to get mad about this.
[01:47:43.314 --> 01:47:44.355]  Get upset about this.
[01:47:44.355 --> 01:47:46.216]  Get involved.
[01:47:46.216 --> 01:47:52.138]  Alright, I'm gonna go to, um... Who was the caller I actually hung up on earlier that I said I was gonna go back to?
[01:47:52.500 --> 01:47:55.661]  We're going to go to Steve, then we're going to go to Sam in Germany.
[01:47:55.661 --> 01:47:56.442]  Steve, you're on the air.
[01:47:56.442 --> 01:47:57.742]  Thanks for holding.
[01:47:57.742 --> 01:47:59.823]  Hey, thanks for getting me back on.
[01:47:59.823 --> 01:48:04.605]  Okay, so you go in the tire place, they're griping about oil prices going up, and I accidentally cut you off.
[01:48:04.605 --> 01:48:08.226]  Right, and before I get back to that, I just want to make a personal comment.
[01:48:08.226 --> 01:48:14.829]  I am so sorry to be an evil, mean, bad, rebellious, stiff-necked, non-conformist, feudal slave.
[01:48:15.526 --> 01:48:21.656]  But I'm going to do what they don't want me to do and that's use the brain God gave me and think critically and then speak out in response.
[01:48:21.656 --> 01:48:25.042]  That's Al-Qaeda, that's Al-Qaeda asking questions.
[01:48:25.042 --> 01:48:26.764]  Right, I know, we just can't do that.
[01:48:26.764 --> 01:48:28.227]  Bang taser to death is good.
[01:48:29.332 --> 01:48:31.975]  And I'm sorry, I'm going to do like our founding fathers did.
[01:48:31.975 --> 01:48:32.676]  I'm going to rebel.
[01:48:32.676 --> 01:48:33.497]  They were bad.
[01:48:33.497 --> 01:48:35.380]  You get arrested for talking about them now.
[01:48:35.380 --> 01:48:36.361]  I have it on video.
[01:48:36.361 --> 01:48:37.262]  By the way, I'm not joking.
[01:48:37.262 --> 01:48:39.505]  I have state police arresting people for constitutions.
[01:48:39.505 --> 01:48:42.148]  They find it and go, who can't believe we got one?
[01:48:42.148 --> 01:48:43.410]  I'm not joking, listeners.
[01:48:43.410 --> 01:48:44.251]  This is not a joke.
[01:48:44.251 --> 01:48:44.691]  Go ahead.
[01:48:44.691 --> 01:48:47.715]  Well, see, the thing is that this is now personal for me because
[01:48:48.414 --> 01:48:59.384]  My friend Jeff is the one you interviewed from the Bible College that had the DHS guy show up and accuse him of committing an act of terrorism and espionage for talking to Boy Scouts about the Constitution.
[01:48:59.384 --> 01:49:01.847]  I know, and the average idiot out there doesn't know that we're telling the truth.
[01:49:01.847 --> 01:49:02.087]  Right.
[01:49:02.087 --> 01:49:03.108]  But listen, I don't have a lot of time.
[01:49:03.108 --> 01:49:04.249]  I gotta hurry to the other callers.
[01:49:04.529 --> 01:49:05.790]  You want to tell the story about the oil.
[01:49:05.790 --> 01:49:06.090]  Right.
[01:49:06.090 --> 01:49:15.914]  So what happened was, I was in this tire store and I heard these guys talking about, you know, who do the oil companies think they're fooling, saying the price per barrel doesn't affect the price of the gas, the pump.
[01:49:15.914 --> 01:49:21.476]  And I chimed in, and this is why I appreciate you, Shell, being armed with the truth, which is our greatest weapon.
[01:49:21.476 --> 01:49:30.379]  I said, well, they're giving you a half-truth because they said actually the main reason that has to do with it, but the main reason is the devaluation of the dollar.
[01:49:30.379 --> 01:49:33.941]  And this one guy, it's like a light went out of his head and he said, yeah, you know, you're right.
[01:49:34.765 --> 01:49:36.806]  And this is the thing that people need to understand.
[01:49:36.806 --> 01:49:38.947]  They will never say that in the media.
[01:49:38.947 --> 01:49:40.107]  It's like a big secret.
[01:49:40.107 --> 01:49:48.791]  I mean, I hear these financial shows, and I appreciate your call, talking about, you get your 8% annual in this mutual fund, and I'm like, none of it matters!
[01:49:48.791 --> 01:49:51.652]  We've got 15% inflation!
[01:49:51.652 --> 01:49:53.012]  13% if you want to be conservative!
[01:49:53.012 --> 01:49:55.994]  Compounded!
[01:49:55.994 --> 01:50:00.155]  You know what that means, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:50:00.155 --> 01:50:01.116]  Oh my gosh.
[01:50:01.116 --> 01:50:03.196]  And by the way, that's what we have domestically.
[01:50:04.909 --> 01:50:09.250]  That's, oh my gosh, it's, it's, it's, I'm very upset about this.
[01:50:09.250 --> 01:50:12.070]  Uh, let's go ahead and take, you know what it means to the economy and our future?
[01:50:12.070 --> 01:50:16.151]  I mean, how are they gonna keep two million cops hired?
[01:50:16.151 --> 01:50:23.193]  And all these bureaucrats, when everything's going bankrupt, they're just gonna write more tickets and squeeze harder.
[01:50:23.193 --> 01:50:25.913]  Go ahead, you're on the air from Germany, Sam.
[01:50:25.913 --> 01:50:27.534]  Hey Alex, how you doing, Patriot?
[01:50:27.534 --> 01:50:29.734]  Thank you for holding from Deutschland, what's on your mind today?
[01:50:30.370 --> 01:50:36.395]  Alex, I want to be a real-world voucher here for the devaluation of the frickin' dollar over here in Europe.
[01:50:36.395 --> 01:50:40.258]  Let me tell you about the euro and how it's just beaten the dollar down to the ground.
[01:50:40.258 --> 01:50:45.662]  I don't know if you've seen today, but the official exchange rate is like, you pay $1.57 for one euro, and that's if you trade millions.
[01:50:48.697 --> 01:50:55.163]  You take $4,700 over here, you'll come over to Europe, you'll end up here with $2,700.
[01:50:55.163 --> 01:50:56.825]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:50:56.825 --> 01:50:58.426]  And I'm just an average Joe, small guy.
[01:50:58.426 --> 01:51:01.089]  I just want to let everybody know, it's real, it's not made up.
[01:51:01.089 --> 01:51:02.750]  No, Germany doesn't exist.
[01:51:02.750 --> 01:51:04.732]  Nothing exists.
[01:51:04.732 --> 01:51:08.155]  Police in black uniforms, tasering people to death is good.
[01:51:08.155 --> 01:51:09.636]  FEMA camps are good.
[01:51:09.636 --> 01:51:11.158]  Millions of people in prison is good.
[01:51:11.158 --> 01:51:11.198]  No.
[01:51:13.755 --> 01:51:14.696]  Well, go Alex!
[01:51:14.696 --> 01:51:15.936]  Rock the world!
[01:51:15.936 --> 01:51:17.277]  So what is it like in Germany?
[01:51:17.277 --> 01:51:20.078]  Are they worried as the dollar implodes?
[01:51:20.078 --> 01:51:20.759]  Yes, they are.
[01:51:20.759 --> 01:51:33.285]  They're saying that if it keeps getting worse and worse, it's going to affect Germany adversely, and especially some of the other countries in Europe that have based so much of their financial data on the dollar.
[01:51:33.285 --> 01:51:34.246]  Germany doesn't have as much.
[01:51:34.246 --> 01:51:34.726]  That's right.
[01:51:34.726 --> 01:51:38.488]  It's causing massive devaluation everywhere.
[01:51:38.488 --> 01:51:40.469]  It's causing global inflation.
[01:51:41.224 --> 01:51:41.904]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:51:41.904 --> 01:51:43.745]  I was pissed off in America about it.
[01:51:43.745 --> 01:51:49.887]  Alex, I'm pissed off that you can't even travel two oceans or an ocean away and have to still deal with this New World Order crap.
[01:51:49.887 --> 01:51:51.147]  This stuff's got to end, Alex.
[01:51:51.147 --> 01:51:53.868]  I hear you, and I appreciate you over there.
[01:51:53.868 --> 01:52:01.331]  Unfortunately, we had it so good in the land of the free, home of the brave, that criminals came in, got good at conning people, and good at PR.
[01:52:01.331 --> 01:52:08.813]  I mean, when you hear about global warming, folks, that's about taxes and social workers in your house, in your business, telling you what to do.
[01:52:09.929 --> 01:52:14.192]  You know, Barack Obama says oil prices are a good thing because it teaches us to get little cars.
[01:52:14.192 --> 01:52:15.733]  It's all a scam!
[01:52:15.733 --> 01:52:20.116]  It's our dollars been devalued.
[01:52:20.116 --> 01:52:21.858]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:52:21.858 --> 01:52:23.159]  Let's talk to Mike in Oregon.
[01:52:23.159 --> 01:52:23.939]  Thanks for holding, Mike.
[01:52:23.939 --> 01:52:25.720]  You're on the air.
[01:52:25.720 --> 01:52:29.263]  Thank you very much indeed, sir, and great shows always.
[01:52:29.722 --> 01:52:39.990]  Everything you say is nothing but the truth, and that stupid guy who said 9-1-1 wasn't inside jobs is absolutely wrong.
[01:52:39.990 --> 01:52:42.472]  9-1-1 was inside jobs.
[01:52:42.472 --> 01:52:47.175]  I tell it today, I tell it tomorrow, I tell it 100 years from now.
[01:52:47.175 --> 01:52:59.144]  And regarding Iran's situation, I would like to speak with you, sir, and when the Bush went to Israel for the 60th anniversary of the Zionist regime,
[01:52:59.620 --> 01:53:00.721]  I don't think so.
[01:53:16.434 --> 01:53:17.074]  I think?
[01:53:34.321 --> 01:53:36.362]  But they separated and then there were...
[01:54:04.421 --> 01:54:10.363]  Why should I care if the White House writes memos saying they can torture small children in front of their parents with pliers?
[01:54:10.363 --> 01:54:12.624]  That's freedom, sir!
[01:54:12.624 --> 01:54:15.545]  Why should I care?
[01:54:15.545 --> 01:54:17.065]  But freedom is bad, sir!
[01:54:17.065 --> 01:54:20.566]  We need to get the new idea and be neocons or be liberals.
[01:54:25.529 --> 01:54:29.450]  And decide that CPS kidnapping our children without due process is good.
[01:54:29.450 --> 01:54:31.191]  I mean, let me get serious for a minute.
[01:54:31.191 --> 01:54:35.912]  Are you more afraid of criminals and the average person in the street, or are you afraid of the government?
[01:54:35.912 --> 01:54:36.892]  You're afraid of the government.
[01:54:36.892 --> 01:54:38.012]  You know they're bad.
[01:54:38.012 --> 01:54:39.393]  You know they're scum.
[01:54:39.393 --> 01:54:43.854]  Now, the government's got a lot of good people in it, but those directing it from the top are bad.
[01:54:43.854 --> 01:54:44.974]  It is illegitimate.
[01:54:44.974 --> 01:54:45.755]  It is rotten.
[01:54:45.755 --> 01:54:46.995]  It is disgusting.
[01:54:46.995 --> 01:54:50.536]  Its crimes are so legion, I can't even list them here.
[01:54:50.536 --> 01:54:52.777]  I mean, it's mind-blowing, the news I've got.
[01:54:52.777 --> 01:54:54.317]  The news I haven't even covered today.
[01:54:57.093 --> 01:54:59.355]  It's just incredible.
[01:54:59.355 --> 01:55:03.858]  Good to hear from you, sir.
[01:55:03.858 --> 01:55:05.299]  Who's up next here?
[01:55:05.299 --> 01:55:07.621]  Avon in Nashville.
[01:55:07.621 --> 01:55:08.161]  You're on the air.
[01:55:08.161 --> 01:55:12.485]  Go ahead.
[01:55:12.485 --> 01:55:22.252]  First place, I would just like to apologize to We Are Change Ohio and We Are Change Kentucky because I was trying to hold them down at the Oliver North thing this past weekend and it kind of dissolved on me at the last minute.
[01:55:22.791 --> 01:55:25.292]  I'd like to give a shout-out to them, because I was definitely there with them as well.
[01:55:25.292 --> 01:55:28.473]  So you're having a private discussion with them on a syndicated radio show?
[01:55:28.473 --> 01:55:31.634]  I don't even know what you're talking about, so how are they going to know?
[01:55:31.634 --> 01:55:34.175]  Of course, but... I don't understand what you're talking about.
[01:55:34.175 --> 01:55:36.416]  Let's go ahead and talk to Gary in California.
[01:55:36.416 --> 01:55:38.496]  Go ahead, Gary, you're on the air.
[01:55:38.496 --> 01:55:39.457]  Yeah, this is Gary.
[01:55:39.457 --> 01:55:44.919]  Hey, I want to talk about the... Yeah, it says Gary right here on my screen, so I'm calling you, Gary.
[01:55:44.919 --> 01:55:47.119]  I'm calling you out!
[01:55:47.119 --> 01:55:49.140]  Hey, you're part of the Esoteric Agenda, right?
[01:55:51.300 --> 01:56:05.548]  You know, I'm trying to figure out how Hillary thinks she can become President, because I noticed in there after watching it happen a number of times that it says that, you know, if you weren't connected to the British dynasty, you know, the clinging and all that stuff, I can't find out where she's connected.
[01:56:05.548 --> 01:56:06.228]  Well, that's right.
[01:56:06.228 --> 01:56:15.133]  Obama is through Cheney and all of his major bloodlines on his mommy's side link back to the Queenie there, like all U.S.
[01:56:15.133 --> 01:56:15.734]  Presidents do.
[01:56:16.998 --> 01:56:19.759]  She does have the... I mean, he does have the bloodline.
[01:56:19.759 --> 01:56:21.359]  Herr Hillary doesn't.
[01:56:21.359 --> 01:56:23.020]  Hitler-y doesn't.
[01:56:23.020 --> 01:56:24.040]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:26.941]  I mean, Barack Obama, all of them, they're all... Who cares?
[01:56:26.941 --> 01:56:27.501]  They're puppets.
[01:56:27.501 --> 01:56:28.881]  They don't run anything.
[01:56:28.881 --> 01:56:29.741]  Oh, I realize that.
[01:56:29.741 --> 01:56:30.621]  I think you do, too.
[01:56:30.621 --> 01:56:35.923]  You know, there's just more to... You don't have... Follow, uh, you know, Michael... Terrence is, right?
[01:56:35.923 --> 01:56:36.503]  Say that again?
[01:56:36.503 --> 01:56:39.964]  T-A-R... I don't understand you.
[01:56:39.964 --> 01:56:40.804]  I'm sorry.
[01:56:40.804 --> 01:56:41.524]  I'm not being mean.
[01:56:41.524 --> 01:56:43.845]  I'm just out of time here to the callers.
[01:56:43.845 --> 01:56:45.045]  And, uh, I, uh...
[01:56:46.226 --> 01:56:48.907]  Personally, just some days don't care anymore.
[01:56:48.907 --> 01:56:51.129]  I have to be quite honest with you.
[01:56:51.129 --> 01:56:54.891]  Great job to the crew in there today, running things.
[01:56:54.891 --> 01:56:59.573]  I want to thank all the listeners, all the affiliates, all the sponsors.
[01:56:59.573 --> 01:57:00.534]  I love this country.
[01:57:00.534 --> 01:57:07.798]  We've been the greatest nation in the history of the world, but we're the spoiled rotten kids of spoiled rotten kids of spoiled rotten kids.
[01:57:07.798 --> 01:57:09.719]  We've gotten pretty decadent.
[01:57:09.719 --> 01:57:11.540]  And let me tell you, I've studied history.
[01:57:12.854 --> 01:57:17.295]  And I can't believe how evil the New World Order is or what they're setting up.
[01:57:17.295 --> 01:57:21.177]  All of you out there better realize that sitting this out isn't going to protect you.
[01:57:21.177 --> 01:57:28.819]  You've got to get involved now to fight tyranny and fight evil and get out there and take on corruption or it's going to eat your lunch, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:57:29.600 --> 01:57:33.421]  If you don't stand up against corruption, hardcore tyranny comes.
[01:57:33.421 --> 01:57:35.661]  Government's killed over 200 million people last century.
[01:57:35.661 --> 01:57:37.642]  They're gearing up to do it here.
[01:57:37.642 --> 01:57:39.402]  I'm not going quietly into the night.
[01:57:39.402 --> 01:57:40.323]  God bless you all.
[01:57:40.323 --> 01:57:40.903]  See you back here.
[01:57:40.903 --> 01:57:41.843]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:57:41.843 --> 01:57:45.104]  As you know, GCN is a huge supporter of Ron Paul and all he stands for.
[01:57:45.104 --> 01:57:53.566]  That's why, for a limited time, I have personally set aside commercial inventory allowing advertisers the chance to show their personal support for Ron Paul while promoting their products.
[01:57:53.566 --> 01:57:58.967]  If you would like to voice your support for Ron Paul's march to the White House and have thought about advertising on GCN,
[01:57:59.107 --> 01:57:59.828]  Give us a call at 877-996-4327.
[01:57:59.828 --> 01:58:02.770]  That's 877-996-4327 or go to GCNlive.com today and click on the Support Ron Paul link on our homepage.
[01:58:12.301 --> 01:58:13.381]  Looking for profit?
[01:58:13.381 --> 01:58:15.202]  Looking for safety and security?
[01:58:15.202 --> 01:58:18.342]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[01:58:18.342 --> 01:58:25.984]  This low mintage collector coin with a total series mintage under $600,000 has sold at four times its current price.
[01:58:25.984 --> 01:58:29.725]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[01:58:29.725 --> 01:58:31.545]  Secure your position today.
[01:58:31.545 --> 01:58:32.825]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:58:32.825 --> 01:58:33.045]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:58:40.478 --> 01:58:40.938]  Fact.
[01:58:40.938 --> 01:58:46.963]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[01:58:46.963 --> 01:58:51.326]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[01:58:51.326 --> 01:58:59.032]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[01:58:59.032 --> 01:58:59.813]  The solution.
[01:58:59.813 --> 01:59:04.016]  Detoxification integrated with Electro-Chi Premier Energy Foot Spa.
[01:59:04.016 --> 01:59:06.038]  The Electro-Chi Premier Energy Foot Spa.
[01:59:06.118 --> 01:59:06.498]  I think so.
[01:59:26.189 --> 01:59:28.531]  And health in every aspect of your being.
