[00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.090]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.851]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.851 --> 00:00:09.631]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.631 --> 00:00:11.191]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.191 --> 00:00:12.752]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.752 --> 00:00:16.933]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:27.815]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.815 --> 00:00:31.796]  Coming up in about 30 minutes, we have the superintendent of schools,
[00:00:33.607 --> 00:00:38.790]  School District here in Texas, where they are arming the teachers.
[00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.812]  He will be joining us in about 30 minutes.
[00:00:41.812 --> 00:00:57.480]  Cindy Sheehan is going to be on with us in the fourth hour today, dealing with her run for the House of Representatives against the Speaker of the House's seat, Nancy, I love war and corruption, and the police state, Pelosi.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.202]  We will also have wide open phones throughout the broadcast today.
[00:01:02.321 --> 00:01:11.348]  There's also an interesting little esoteric item that's up on JonesReport.com right now, an exclusive that I'll be going over a little bit later.
[00:01:11.348 --> 00:01:14.851]  That's JonesReport.com only.
[00:01:14.851 --> 00:01:19.475]  Nuke's unlikely to be affected by Musharraf leaving office.
[00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.633]  And that's because it is a military puppet dictatorship with U.S.
[00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:29.778]  troops guarding those facilities and the same ruling 10 council that he's been a puppet for through the U.S.
[00:01:29.778 --> 00:01:33.281]  and England is in control of the nuclear weapons.
[00:01:33.281 --> 00:01:35.302]  But we'll be going over that.
[00:01:35.302 --> 00:01:40.767]  Ambush of French paratroopers near Kabul kills 10 in Afghanistan.
[00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:41.688]  More U.S.
[00:01:41.688 --> 00:01:45.611]  and, quote, coalition troops are dying now in Afghanistan than in Iraq.
[00:01:47.023 --> 00:01:54.266]  Russian General says that Georgia may commit false flag terrorist attacks.
[00:01:54.266 --> 00:02:02.709]  We even have him saying this up on Russia Today because that is a main tool of government staging terror attacks.
[00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:09.511]  The Russians have done it throughout history but not as much as the British or the folks in the United States or the Israelis.
[00:02:09.511 --> 00:02:11.932]  They just absolutely love it.
[00:02:11.932 --> 00:02:13.493]  The Nazis were
[00:02:14.844 --> 00:02:18.245]  Big supporters of that form of warfare.
[00:02:18.245 --> 00:02:26.329]  And until the public realizes that most of the terror attacks and events you see are state-sponsored to be blamed on their enemies.
[00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:28.550]  I mean, who has the motive?
[00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:35.232]  All the Republican memos and Democratic memos and statesmen on both sides, if you can call them that.
[00:02:35.232 --> 00:02:36.673]  Zbigniew Brzezinski on the left.
[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.462]  You've got all these neocons on the right.
[00:02:40.462 --> 00:02:49.630]  They're all on the same team saying how great false flags are to show the public how to give up their rights and accept wars and basically not question their activities.
[00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.074]  But top Russian general says Georgia may commit false flag terror attacks.
[00:02:54.074 --> 00:02:56.356]  We're going to cover that out of the break.
[00:02:56.356 --> 00:03:00.139]  That's a PrisonPlanet.com exclusive in the Western media.
[00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:04.202]  We picked up on that in the Russian news and it's all detailed there for you at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:03:06.053 --> 00:03:15.058]  Joe Biden, who they're now reporting, the AP and others, is probably who Barack Obama is going to tap if it's not Hillary Clinton.
[00:03:15.058 --> 00:03:23.323]  In fact, Las Vegas is in a dead heat, the people betting that it'll be Joe Biden or it will be hair Hillary Clinton, both.
[00:03:23.963 --> 00:03:25.324]  Master criminals.
[00:03:25.324 --> 00:03:33.851]  Joe Biden promises Georgia a billion dollars to, quote, rebuild after the vicious, premeditated, dastardly sneak attack of the Russians.
[00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:36.533]  Of course, that isn't what happened, but hey, so what?
[00:03:36.533 --> 00:03:41.217]  You know, the public believes fluoride is good for them and mercury is good for them.
[00:03:41.217 --> 00:03:43.859]  Credit crunch may take out large U.S.
[00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.842]  bank, warns former IMF chief,
[00:03:47.987 --> 00:03:49.188]  Some financial news there.
[00:03:49.188 --> 00:03:52.290]  Also, Japan to label goods carbon footprints.
[00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.430]  The AP is reporting.
[00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.832]  And that's similar to what's happening in California and other places.
[00:03:55.832 --> 00:04:00.335]  Once you can label something, you can begin taxing people on their choices.
[00:04:00.335 --> 00:04:04.958]  And to tax, you have to track and chronicle.
[00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:13.503]  Also, Arctic ice sheet grows by 30% in one year at record levels since they've been recording the Arctic's growth.
[00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:14.204]  Doesn't matter.
[00:04:14.204 --> 00:04:16.285]  The public can't find the Arctic.
[00:04:17.478 --> 00:04:19.579]  And so, I'm not being mean here.
[00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.181]  They can just tell them that the polar bears can't swim.
[00:04:22.181 --> 00:04:23.962]  There's more reports of that.
[00:04:23.962 --> 00:04:28.304]  They're reporting on the news that polar bears are drowning because the ice all melted.
[00:04:28.304 --> 00:04:31.646]  Folks, polar bears are the greatest swimming land mammal.
[00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:32.687]  They can swim 300 miles.
[00:04:32.687 --> 00:04:34.347]  They routinely swim 150, 200.
[00:04:34.347 --> 00:04:36.349]  Hunting.
[00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:37.069]  Does it matter?
[00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:37.869]  They can't swim.
[00:04:37.869 --> 00:04:38.730]  The public believes it.
[00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.431]  They also believe Russia attacked Georgia.
[00:04:41.632 --> 00:04:42.993]  It is a big idea.
[00:04:42.993 --> 00:04:43.574]  A new world order.
[00:04:43.574 --> 00:04:46.936]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:05:09.992 --> 00:05:11.954]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[00:05:11.954 --> 00:05:15.619]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[00:05:15.619 --> 00:05:18.802]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:18.802 --> 00:05:24.889]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:29.133 --> 00:05:34.595]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:34.595 --> 00:05:38.457]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:38.457 --> 00:05:41.018]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:41.018 --> 00:05:42.178]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:42.178 --> 00:05:42.979]  They're not after money.
[00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:44.239]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:44.239 --> 00:05:45.220]  They're after power.
[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.380]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.142]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[00:05:57.885 --> 00:06:01.268]  You have been warned.
[00:06:01.268 --> 00:06:08.734]  Even terrible gas prices don't come close to the disaster of food costs from shortages already destroying millions of American families.
[00:06:08.734 --> 00:06:12.778]  Wheat for flour is already four times more expensive than it was about a year ago.
[00:06:12.778 --> 00:06:15.400]  Food costs continue to double because there's no food
[00:06:19.838 --> 00:06:20.719]  We're good to go!
[00:06:38.511 --> 00:06:46.001]  eFoodsDirect.com also has a complete bulk supply of superfood at half the cost of last year's groceries.

[00:06:59.918 --> 00:07:01.899]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:08.863]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:07:08.863 --> 00:07:17.268]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[00:08:00.253 --> 00:08:05.315]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.315 --> 00:08:07.917]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:28.097 --> 00:08:49.007]  There is the visible world of geopolitical jockeying, different power structures colliding, but then there is the unseen or the occult, the hidden.
[00:08:49.007 --> 00:08:53.509]  And I want to just briefly get into the hidden before I get into the seen.
[00:08:55.865 --> 00:09:11.273]  We know that the ruling elite of the planet have been guarding knowledge of the ancients for thousands of years.
[00:09:11.273 --> 00:09:22.038]  The knowledge of architecture, the knowledge of farming, agriculture, military knowledge, organizational knowledge.
[00:09:23.903 --> 00:09:29.105]  Behavioral knowledge on how to govern populations, how to manipulate populations.
[00:09:29.105 --> 00:09:46.950]  That is just a historical fact that statecraft was developed to a high science 4,000 years ago in Egypt and of course in Mesopotamia and other areas of the Middle East and Central Asia, India, China.
[00:09:51.904 --> 00:09:57.789]  And the general public has been convinced, at least in the past, to believe that there is no hidden hand.
[00:09:57.789 --> 00:09:59.250]  There are no elites.
[00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:01.072]  There is no subterfuge going on.
[00:10:01.072 --> 00:10:03.454]  There is no deception going on.
[00:10:03.454 --> 00:10:04.415]  Government's good.
[00:10:04.415 --> 00:10:05.776]  The world's a wonderland.
[00:10:05.776 --> 00:10:06.697]  Everything's happy.
[00:10:06.697 --> 00:10:08.058]  Everything's fun.
[00:10:08.058 --> 00:10:12.041]  Just fall asleep at the wheel and just enjoy yourself.
[00:10:12.041 --> 00:10:13.222]  Life is a merry-go-round.
[00:10:14.736 --> 00:10:38.509]  Meanwhile, carnage and death and destruction goes on all around us continually in the third world and different globalist bodies like the UN and others have been caught paying to have women sterilized and the old euthanized and one-child policies and babies killed and all of that goes on and now instead of denying
[00:10:39.534 --> 00:10:51.497]  That China has, quote, secret torture prisons where they took, not just demonstrators, but people who didn't look right, who might embarrass the Chinese government.
[00:10:51.497 --> 00:11:08.842]  They take them to these facilities, according to mainstream news, and torture them, and kill them, and take their organs, and in every major city, they have 24 mobile execution vans per city that drive around, around the clock, just grabbing people and murdering them.
[00:11:11.577 --> 00:11:13.198]  And does the U.S.
[00:11:13.198 --> 00:11:14.659]  government say that's bad now?
[00:11:14.659 --> 00:11:15.280]  No.
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.062]  They did just 10 years ago, 20 years ago.
[00:11:18.062 --> 00:11:19.663]  Does the British government decry that?
[00:11:19.663 --> 00:11:21.044]  No.
[00:11:21.044 --> 00:11:23.345]  Does the citizenry even really decry that?
[00:11:23.345 --> 00:11:25.086]  No.
[00:11:25.086 --> 00:11:29.109]  And now we get secret jails.
[00:11:29.109 --> 00:11:34.813]  And the police were confronted a week and a half ago about, we hear you've got federal funds to build a secret detainment facility for 5,000 people.
[00:11:34.813 --> 00:11:36.874]  Oh, that's a conspiracy theory.
[00:11:36.874 --> 00:11:38.055]  That's not going on.
[00:11:38.055 --> 00:11:39.656]  And then it turns out they had built it.
[00:11:39.656 --> 00:11:40.517]  It was going on.
[00:11:43.735 --> 00:11:49.577]  I mean, if they're going to have some mass detainment facility, why not just be honest about the fact that you have it?
[00:11:49.577 --> 00:11:52.098]  No, it's all about secretiveness.
[00:11:52.098 --> 00:11:54.599]  This culture of secretiveness.
[00:11:54.599 --> 00:12:00.161]  That's all a cult means, is secretive, hidden.
[00:12:00.161 --> 00:12:06.483]  And we think of one of the vestigial arms of the occult as guys in pointy hats and witches in brooms.
[00:12:06.483 --> 00:12:07.724]  That's a very small part of it.
[00:12:07.724 --> 00:12:08.284]  It just means
[00:12:09.329 --> 00:12:24.893]  Upper knowledge, higher knowledge, walled off knowledge, secreted knowledge, cloistered knowledge, guarded knowledge, and this is what they traffic in.
[00:12:24.893 --> 00:12:28.734]  And their evil cannot stand and we simply become aware of it.
[00:12:28.734 --> 00:12:37.097]  Now going back on the subject of China, they've had fake fireworks displays, they've had fake
[00:12:38.769 --> 00:12:59.520]  Superimposed TV productions that they put out worldwide in several reel showing God stepping into the arena on 888 at 888 in the afternoon with 888 drummers all playing at the same time.
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:03.642]  All occultic mixing bizarre Germanic death cult druid
[00:13:04.762 --> 00:13:12.067]  Rituals of the Olympics that Hitler revived for the 36 Olympics.
[00:13:12.067 --> 00:13:17.750]  He drew the rings, he came up with the torch, the name, everything is Adolf Hitler.
[00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:19.611]  A giant black magic ritual.
[00:13:19.611 --> 00:13:24.614]  I mean, you don't believe me, just go to the encyclopedia, it's admitted.
[00:13:24.614 --> 00:13:30.818]  Every time I throw that out that Hitler, especially years ago when nobody seemed to know, now it's more popularized, it's even been on CNN,
[00:13:32.074 --> 00:13:35.936]  I get emails and calls going, I thought you were crazy and I looked it up and it's true!
[00:13:35.936 --> 00:13:39.938]  It's a weird Nazi black magic ritual.
[00:13:39.938 --> 00:13:41.679]  Well, of course it is!
[00:13:41.679 --> 00:13:44.460]  See, that's all any of these people believe in.
[00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:45.461]  They obsess on it.
[00:13:45.461 --> 00:13:46.281]  It's constant.
[00:13:46.281 --> 00:13:55.566]  Mixed in with a bunch of bizarre Chinese mystery religion 5,000 year old weirdness.
[00:13:55.566 --> 00:13:58.647]  Numerology.
[00:13:58.647 --> 00:13:59.968]  And so with that backdrop,
[00:14:00.976 --> 00:14:28.304]  There have been scores of films, scores of newspaper articles, UN announcements, speeches, there was a Phillips TV ad where it says on 9-11 everything changes, and this was in 1999, and it shows two F-16s drop 2,000 pound bombs on the World Trade Centers and blow them up.
[00:14:29.361 --> 00:14:31.961]  And it says, Phillips changing your world.
[00:14:31.961 --> 00:14:32.201]  What?
[00:14:32.201 --> 00:14:34.042]  I mean, that's not even veiled.
[00:14:34.042 --> 00:14:43.403]  Tom Clancy comes out a year and a half before 9-11 and writes a novel about hijackers hijacking jets to fly them into the World Trade Centers.
[00:14:43.403 --> 00:14:59.046]  Tom Clancy writes the script for the Ghost Troop Ghost Recon video game and in it
[00:15:04.805 --> 00:15:11.207]  In the middle of 2008, the video game was made in 2001, U.S.
[00:15:11.207 --> 00:15:22.811]  forces backing Georgians attack Ossetia, South Ossetia, and are repulsed.
[00:15:22.811 --> 00:15:32.934]  You see, it's so important to them to flaunt it and throw it in your face, and if you study black magic, which I have done, it's... I mean, I've read
[00:15:34.446 --> 00:15:37.348]  Quite a few books on the subject.
[00:15:37.348 --> 00:15:47.534]  If you study the occult, and by black magic, they just believe that they are actively, for their own selfishness, changing the world.
[00:15:47.534 --> 00:15:56.800]  Going out and interfering with others, dominating others, that's black magic, or the left-hand path, or the right-hand path, which all these, quote, white magicians are into.
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:02.223]  Whether you believe it's real or not, the elite really do believe in this, and they believe that
[00:16:03.098 --> 00:16:09.640]  By putting out totems, and signets, and signs, ziggurats, or markers.
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.821]  The Vikings did it, the Egyptians did it, the Aztecs did it, they all do it.
[00:16:12.821 --> 00:16:28.387]  When they were about to have a battle, the Vikings, and the Aztecs, and the Romans, and everybody else, would march up with a stone, or a wooden idol, a standing stone, and place it in the ground, as a marker.
[00:16:28.387 --> 00:16:32.388]  And they believed that that projected the gods strength into them, for the attack.
[00:16:34.821 --> 00:16:43.687]  I was just at the Capitol with family, the Texas Capitol, this weekend, showing them around.
[00:16:43.687 --> 00:16:54.614]  And we went into the Senate chambers that have all those famous paintings of Battle of San Jacinto, Battle of Goliad, Battle of the Alamo.
[00:16:54.614 --> 00:17:01.899]  And on two of the major paintings, the one from, I took photos of it, I meant to put it on the web, from San Jacinto and the Alamo,
[00:17:02.921 --> 00:17:08.204]  There is the flag of the goddess and they're carrying it before them.
[00:17:08.204 --> 00:17:27.135]  So this has been passed on since ancient times and that's what it is when you see all of these movies and all of these programs and I mean there's hundreds of them.
[00:17:27.135 --> 00:17:29.777]  Like I want to open a thread up on the PrisonPlanet.com forum
[00:17:31.033 --> 00:17:45.019]  Last night, when Aaron called me about this latest information he discovered, I just said, I know you're real busy trying to finish up the encoding and the upload of Fabled Enemies for the members at PrisonPlanet.tv and all these different formats and qualities.
[00:17:45.019 --> 00:17:46.880]  I said, but I want you to go ahead and write a blurb.
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:47.861]  He said, sure.
[00:17:47.861 --> 00:17:50.102]  And I said, well, don't spend hours on it.
[00:17:50.102 --> 00:17:53.884]  Just put the lone gunman and the Simpsons and this new one in there.
[00:17:55.538 --> 00:18:18.174]  But we need to add a link on the PrisonPlanet.com forum so that our listeners can, because I can't even remember all the hundreds of totems or lesser magics, the spells is what these are, where they show you, you know, the Masonic US Mint in the years before 9-11 creates the money.
[00:18:20.669 --> 00:18:27.733]  Where you can fold it and show the towers and the Pentagon, and when they're hit, when they're on fire, when they collapse.
[00:18:27.733 --> 00:18:31.474]  And then within an hour of 9-11, that was on the internet already.
[00:18:31.474 --> 00:18:33.375]  People saying, look, you can fold money this way.
[00:18:33.375 --> 00:18:38.198]  Well, those that were involved in the attacks, they put that out.
[00:18:38.198 --> 00:18:42.060]  When that was leaked out on the message boards within one hour of the attack, no one would have noticed that.
[00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:43.200]  No one would have known that.
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.862]  You see, this is important to them in this ritual magic
[00:18:49.833 --> 00:18:51.714]  That they are engaging.
[00:18:51.714 --> 00:18:59.979]  They believe that they need to leave tokens in the real world of what they're doing.
[00:18:59.979 --> 00:19:05.622]  And they are doing it.
[00:19:05.622 --> 00:19:07.543]  And they do this over and over again.
[00:19:07.543 --> 00:19:12.426]  Now this latest piece of hundreds, and I want listeners to go in and contribute.
[00:19:12.426 --> 00:19:14.487]  They're in the Prison Planet forum.
[00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:17.288]  There's a link up on prisonplanet.com to the forum if you haven't been there.
[00:19:17.288 --> 00:19:18.529]  And let's create a thread and let's
[00:19:19.798 --> 00:19:20.558]  There's hundreds.
[00:19:20.558 --> 00:19:21.519]  I mean, I'm thinking of them right now.
[00:19:21.519 --> 00:19:24.739]  There's so many.
[00:19:24.739 --> 00:19:33.962]  I can think of three Hollywood movies where they cut to a clock showing 9-11 in the couple years before 9-11, where they show the clock right when buildings blow up at 9-11.
[00:19:33.962 --> 00:19:37.823]  Like saying, buildings are gonna blow up on 9-11.
[00:19:37.823 --> 00:19:42.365]  But this latest one is from the movie The Matrix.
[00:19:42.365 --> 00:19:43.605]  And we're gonna cover this when we get back.
[00:19:43.605 --> 00:19:45.986]  I'm gonna wrap up this esoteric discussion.
[00:19:45.986 --> 00:19:47.066]  Then we've got this, um...
[00:19:49.489 --> 00:19:52.490]  Superintendent coming on about arming teachers in schools.
[00:19:52.490 --> 00:20:00.614]  Then I'm gonna get into the latest developments with the economy, with the nukes, with Pakistan.
[00:20:00.614 --> 00:20:02.815]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:20:02.815 --> 00:20:05.196]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:20:05.196 --> 00:20:07.457]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:20:07.457 --> 00:20:09.057]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:20:09.057 --> 00:20:10.718]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:20:10.718 --> 00:20:13.619]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:20:13.619 --> 00:20:17.241]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:20:26.905 --> 00:20:31.698]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:20:39.646 --> 00:20:43.228]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:20:43.228 --> 00:20:45.549]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:20:45.549 --> 00:20:52.452]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[00:23:03.122 --> 00:23:07.004]  Fight back by doing what thousands of listeners to the Alex Jones Show have done.
[00:23:07.004 --> 00:23:10.066]  Developed by a major oil company, a product that really works.
[00:23:10.066 --> 00:23:13.829]  Introducing SFR's Protect-to-Complete fuel system and engine treatment.
[00:23:13.829 --> 00:23:16.571]  Just one bottle increases mileage for up to six months.
[00:23:16.571 --> 00:23:20.113]  Fleet tested by major oil companies showing improvements in every car tested.

[00:24:22.048 --> 00:24:25.652]  Welcome back!
[00:24:25.652 --> 00:24:27.114]  Alright, up on jonesreport.com...
[00:24:29.625 --> 00:24:32.186]  ...is a big new development.
[00:24:32.186 --> 00:24:42.229]  The Matrix and other 9-11 Hollywood symbolism, JonesReport.com, Aaron Dykes, insiders love bragging to one another about being on the inside.
[00:24:42.229 --> 00:24:47.670]  Perhaps that's one explanation for the abundance of Illuminati symbolism in mainstream media and corporate logos.
[00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:58.134]  Among these interesting references to 9-11 that have been uncovered in media release before 9-11 is a passport for Neo in the blockbuster film The Matrix, released in 1999.
[00:25:00.057 --> 00:25:11.084]  The passport in Neo's file shows an expiration date of September 11, 2001, seemingly now an eerie coincidence found in the smallest of details.
[00:25:11.084 --> 00:25:13.245]  But guess when his passport was issued?
[00:25:13.245 --> 00:25:16.587]  You know, passports are issued for 10 years.
[00:25:16.587 --> 00:25:21.430]  It was issued on September 11, 1991, when George Herbert Walker Bush gave his
[00:25:27.299 --> 00:25:39.126]  State of the Union speech calling for a New World Order and a thousand points of life, light, and a new world coming into view, a big idea.
[00:25:39.126 --> 00:25:41.487]  So you see that over and over again.
[00:25:41.487 --> 00:25:43.708]  It's issued on the day he calls for the New World Order.
[00:25:43.708 --> 00:25:46.790]  His passport expires on 9-11-2001.
[00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:48.371]  And what scene is this?
[00:25:53.234 --> 00:26:08.182]  It's in the movie when the agents, that he thinks are FBI, he doesn't know it's a Matrix, grab him, and take him, and then put that bug, remember, literally a bug, in his stomach to track him.
[00:26:08.182 --> 00:26:10.303]  Remember that?
[00:26:10.303 --> 00:26:20.189]  And it's in that key scene while he's being interrogated, and they're looking at his United States of America, quote, Capitol City, USA.
[00:26:22.409 --> 00:26:26.350]  And of course, they say the real capital of the United States is New York City.
[00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:27.371]  They call it the capital of the world.
[00:26:27.371 --> 00:26:35.873]  So, Capital City, USA, September 11, 2001, Passport Agency, United States of America.
[00:26:35.873 --> 00:26:37.734]  And they throw it down on the counter in front of him.
[00:26:37.734 --> 00:26:45.476]  You have to flip the video over on its head, which is more occultism, and then you can see it straight on.
[00:26:45.476 --> 00:26:49.577]  So it's backwards.
[00:26:49.577 --> 00:26:50.557]  And the date is September 11, 2001.
[00:26:50.557 --> 00:26:50.638]  Now,
[00:26:52.842 --> 00:26:55.904]  This, in and of itself, is not that strong.
[00:26:55.904 --> 00:27:20.181]  But when you then find out that Chris Carter and the X-Files, six months before 9-11, put out a TV program, The Lone Gunman, the spinoff of the X-Files, where the government, a criminal element within the Pentagon, hijacks a jet by remote control to fly it into the World Trade Center, using remote control and blaming it on hijackers, locking down the communications of the plane,
[00:27:20.982 --> 00:27:28.086]  And then you find out they plan to fly it into the towers to blame it on Afghanistan and launch a war in Central Asia and the Middle East.
[00:27:28.086 --> 00:27:37.792]  And he starts talking to his father, who's one of the, you know, high-level shadow government people, and he says, one of the lone gunmen, he says, Dad, you know, how are they going to cover this up?
[00:27:37.792 --> 00:27:38.472]  How are they going to do it?
[00:27:38.472 --> 00:27:42.134]  He says, an anti-terrorism exercise.
[00:27:42.134 --> 00:27:42.875]  The government
[00:27:45.433 --> 00:27:50.455]  We'll be caught off guard because it's going to be done as part of an anti-terror exercise tonight.
[00:27:50.455 --> 00:28:01.519]  So exactly what happened six months later, the government did run drills of the World Trade Center Pentagon being hit by hijacked jets that day and that was used as the cover.
[00:28:01.519 --> 00:28:13.424]  And don't forget they had tripod two of an anthrax attack going on where they had already days before moved out of building seven and moved to mobile command centers so they could continue to organize and run everything even when they blew their own buildings up.
[00:28:14.159 --> 00:28:16.480]  I mean, it is just amazing!
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:20.062]  And then you look at 7-7.
[00:28:20.062 --> 00:28:32.448]  The exact trains being bombed at the exact same time, at the exact same locations, one out of twenty-three-plus truck-a-gillion, billions of times all the grains of sand in all the world.
[00:28:32.448 --> 00:28:38.631]  But then you see all the other 9-11 symbolism in TV and movies leading up to 9-11.
[00:28:38.631 --> 00:28:43.514]  Then you have the long kiss goodnight in 97, big Hollywood movie, where a
[00:28:44.585 --> 00:28:50.552]  Secret government group of defense contractors have tried to blow up the World Trade Center in 93, which is really what they did.
[00:28:50.552 --> 00:28:51.833]  That came out in the New York Times.
[00:28:51.833 --> 00:28:56.959]  And they say, but this time, you know, the terrorists didn't do a good job for us, so we're just going to blow it up ourselves.
[00:28:56.959 --> 00:29:00.422]  How else are we going to get a war in the Middle East?
[00:29:00.422 --> 00:29:03.426]  So later in the show, I'm going to get back into this and play some of those clips.
[00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:13.746]  Or our great YouTube directors out there are welcome to take my analysis right now and put it in with all those clips of the Matrix and the Lone Gunman and all of this and because I don't have the personnel.
[00:29:13.746 --> 00:29:19.970]  If you want to really wake people up, that'll be a top viral video, whoever makes that.
[00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:23.112]  But this is what we're dealing with here.
[00:29:23.112 --> 00:29:27.595]  And we've got some other examples up on JonesReport.com.
[00:29:27.595 --> 00:29:30.437]  The second story from the top at JonesReport.com.
[00:29:32.754 --> 00:29:36.277]  Now, as I said, we're gonna get into armed teachers in Texas.
[00:29:36.277 --> 00:29:38.959]  I think it's a good idea if it's handled right.
[00:29:38.959 --> 00:29:42.202]  We'll find out what you think later, superintendent joining us, scheduled to.
[00:29:42.202 --> 00:29:47.927]  And then we're going to get into the whole geopolitical situation, and then back into the esoteric, and then Cindy Sheehan.
[00:29:47.927 --> 00:29:50.989]  Stay with me.
[00:29:50.989 --> 00:29:52.370]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:54.912]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.912 --> 00:29:57.575]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.797 --> 00:30:03.660]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:05.222]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[00:30:05.222 --> 00:30:07.385]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:30:07.385 --> 00:30:09.287]  The truth story of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:30:09.287 --> 00:30:10.769]  The late, great USA.
[00:30:10.769 --> 00:30:12.551]  America, freedom to fascism.
[00:30:12.551 --> 00:30:17.196]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us.
[00:30:18.097 --> 00:30:18.757]  We're good to go.
[00:30:39.292 --> 00:30:39.973]  We're good to go.
[00:31:00.013 --> 00:31:03.717]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[00:31:03.717 --> 00:31:06.160]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:09.643]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[00:31:09.643 --> 00:31:18.813]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston, online, from my desk, with Webex.
[00:31:19.413 --> 00:31:22.755]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[00:31:22.755 --> 00:31:27.637]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[00:31:27.637 --> 00:31:32.559]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[00:31:32.559 --> 00:31:35.140]  Travel less, meet online with Webex.
[00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:39.042]  For as little as $59 a month, about the price of a tank of gas.
[00:31:39.042 --> 00:31:42.303]  You can host unlimited meetings every month from your desktop.
[00:31:42.303 --> 00:31:43.344]  Webex from Cisco.
[00:31:43.584 --> 00:31:43.824]  I think so.
[00:32:00.791 --> 00:32:04.614]  Attention, this is an extremely urgent self-reliant news bulletin.

[00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:26.352]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[00:32:26.352 --> 00:32:28.474]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[00:32:28.474 --> 00:32:29.455]  this fall?
[00:32:29.455 --> 00:32:30.356]  Don't wait.

[00:33:04.924 --> 00:33:06.944]  This show is documented.
[00:33:06.944 --> 00:33:12.387]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:12.387 --> 00:33:20.591]  If you look at the unified crime statistics of the Department of Justice since 1991, school shootings have dropped around 25%.
[00:33:20.591 --> 00:33:27.694]  And most of those are gangbangers shooting each other in some of the worst areas of the country.
[00:33:27.694 --> 00:33:29.635]  Chicago, LA, New York.
[00:33:30.484 --> 00:33:39.777]  And normally they're in victim disarmament zones where the general public has been disarmed or there's very strict victim disarmament known as gun control.
[00:33:39.777 --> 00:33:46.267]  But still the media hypes it up to where national studies show the average American believes there's an epidemic of school shootings.
[00:33:47.028 --> 00:33:49.670]  There have been a lot of cases that should be famous, but aren't.
[00:33:49.670 --> 00:34:00.956]  In Louisiana, and Texas, and Arkansas, and New York, just scores of cases of where a teenager comes in and starts shooting and may wound one or two people, may kill one person.
[00:34:00.956 --> 00:34:13.403]  Some cases get shoots but misses, and a teacher has broken the quote law and had a gun in their briefcase, or they've run out of their car quickly and gotten a firearm and shot them or driven them off, till the police can get there.
[00:34:14.324 --> 00:34:18.906]  And it'll be in all regional news, but never national news.
[00:34:18.906 --> 00:34:26.909]  Now, my father grew up, of course, in East Texas in a pretty good-sized rural school district, and he would, during quail season or dove season, he'd take a shotgun to school.
[00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:40.534]  He would, you know, get dropped off or ride the bus in, and he was friends with all the coaches, and he would go hunting with them and, you know, some of the other football players, and they had, just until a few years ago, even New York City still had a shooting club for the people, never had a problem.
[00:34:41.847 --> 00:35:00.638]  In every one of the mass shooting cases, Harrison Kleibold, King Cole, the latest cases, the crazy man up in Blacksburg, Virginia, they're all on serotonin reuptake inhibitors and of course it's admitted on the Prozac insert and all other
[00:35:01.588 --> 00:35:07.792]  Serotonin reuptake inhibitors, drug sheets, fact sheets admit it causes psychotic breaks and violent outbreaks.
[00:35:07.792 --> 00:35:08.732]  It's a hallucinogen.
[00:35:08.732 --> 00:35:11.094]  And so some days you're having a good trip, some days you have a bad trip.
[00:35:11.094 --> 00:35:20.159]  So what we really should control is that in young people, but that's not going to happen because the drug companies are pushing it more than ever through the new Freedom Initiative in the schools for quote, mental health screening.
[00:35:20.159 --> 00:35:22.480]  But that's the real root of so much of this.
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:27.123]  But going to our guest, there have been student groups and colleges
[00:35:28.354 --> 00:35:41.637]  And teacher groups who've been calling for being able to be armed or taking a course or letting it be at the discretion of the superintendent of schools or the principal to have a instant access pistol safe, which only they can access in their desk.
[00:35:41.637 --> 00:35:45.038]  And I think it's a fabulous idea.
[00:35:45.038 --> 00:35:46.798]  And it's been proposed.
[00:35:46.798 --> 00:35:50.439]  Texas School District to let teachers carry guns.
[00:35:50.439 --> 00:35:54.640]  A Texas School District will let teachers bring guns to classes in North Texas.
[00:35:55.545 --> 00:36:03.567]  The District Superintendent said on Friday, in what experts said appeared to be a first in the United States, and I don't like Rick Perry, because he's not a real conservative, but I do like what he's done here.
[00:36:03.567 --> 00:36:07.668]  Texas Governor Rick Perry, okay, but teachers, staff carrying guns at school.
[00:36:07.668 --> 00:36:18.952]  So, this is precedent setting, and we are joined by the Herald ISD Superintendent, David Thweatt.
[00:36:18.952 --> 00:36:20.392]  And David, we appreciate you coming on, sir.
[00:36:21.042 --> 00:36:22.623]  Man, I'm glad to be here.
[00:36:22.623 --> 00:36:24.884]  I kind of prefaced that with some of the history.
[00:36:24.884 --> 00:36:32.088]  Tell us about your school district, your decision to do this, or how this occurred, and where you see all this going.
[00:36:32.088 --> 00:36:44.375]  Well, you know, whenever we're looking at the history of school shooting, and you're talking about them, but I think when we go back to the 95, and the Brady Bill, and not allowing guns in schools, I think we've created a killing zone.
[00:36:44.375 --> 00:36:47.617]  And that's when all these major school shootings have occurred.
[00:36:47.617 --> 00:36:48.998]  When we started looking at security,
[00:36:49.458 --> 00:36:53.199]  We decided, obviously, we needed to do something passive, and that's the first thing we did.
[00:36:53.199 --> 00:36:56.781]  We installed the one-entry school with the electronic entry.
[00:36:56.781 --> 00:37:01.482]  All the teachers have fobs, and they can wave in front of a magnetic strip, unlock the door, etc.
[00:37:01.482 --> 00:37:04.623]  We also installed in that system a panic system.
[00:37:04.623 --> 00:37:09.285]  In the administrative offices, there can be a button, can be pushed, all those doors can be locked, sirens go off.
[00:37:10.029 --> 00:37:17.597]  And we also have state-of-the-art cameras, so we spent a lot of money making sure that we have every passive system in place to avoid things.
[00:37:17.597 --> 00:37:19.359]  But then several things started happening.
[00:37:19.359 --> 00:37:24.945]  The first thing that happened was in October 06, you will remember the shooting in Pennsylvania with the Amish.
[00:37:24.945 --> 00:37:25.926]  That was very disturbing.
[00:37:26.606 --> 00:37:30.029]  Uh, and what was disturbing about that was that was a known entity who came into the school.
[00:37:30.029 --> 00:37:32.310]  I believe he was a milk delivery man, wasn't he?
[00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:36.253]  And he came in and shot, uh, and so they let him in the door.
[00:37:36.253 --> 00:37:37.474]  They welcomed him.
[00:37:37.474 --> 00:37:46.560]  And so we could have a situation where we welcome somebody, a delivery man, somebody who's normally there, somebody who for any number of reasons becomes evil or starts acting that way.
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:49.461]  The next thing that was disturbing was the Virginia Tech.
[00:37:49.461 --> 00:37:57.503]  Now, obviously, part of our plan, and many emergency plans, is that the teachers lock those doors, bring the killed children in, and protect them.
[00:37:57.503 --> 00:38:04.185]  Well, in that case, he just chained the doors shut, and then I think he went and knocked the doors down and went and shot them in the classroom.
[00:38:04.185 --> 00:38:09.607]  So, basically, what we had to say is, what happens if somebody gets in our building?
[00:38:09.607 --> 00:38:12.048]  And it's not too hard to do.
[00:38:12.048 --> 00:38:15.709]  They're going to break in, they're going to do something to work their way in around our
[00:38:16.289 --> 00:38:19.233]  That's right, but here we are, 30 minutes from law enforcement.
[00:38:33.810 --> 00:38:37.513]  So, you know, how much killing can be done in 30 minutes?
[00:38:37.513 --> 00:38:38.434]  A lot.
[00:38:38.434 --> 00:38:53.946]  And not just that, but many of us have our own children in that school, and we could, and we live nearby, we could, but you know, somebody comes in the door, I'm gonna run out of the building, leave my children there to go get a gun, well, you know, that's a hard decision, and I don't think I could make that.
[00:38:53.946 --> 00:38:56.327]  So we had to come up with some solution.
[00:38:56.327 --> 00:39:01.852]  So we started researching the policies, and of course, obviously, when anybody research gun violence, and
[00:39:03.027 --> 00:39:10.172]  The real statistics around it, you're going to find that there's a whole lot of hype, just like you said, in Hollywood and anybody else.
[00:39:10.172 --> 00:39:14.936]  And we found out that, you know, the guns aren't dangerous.
[00:39:14.936 --> 00:39:20.560]  Really what's killing kids is transportation and bathtubs and swimming pools and many other things.
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:21.180]  And football!
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:22.281]  Football!
[00:39:22.281 --> 00:39:24.663]  Accidents kill more each year than school shootings.
[00:39:25.243 --> 00:39:25.723]  Right.
[00:39:25.723 --> 00:39:30.044]  So, I mean, there's a lot of things that we are willing to take risks for.
[00:39:30.044 --> 00:39:35.625]  And so, we decided to go the concealed route, because obviously the state legislature allows that.
[00:39:35.625 --> 00:39:37.486]  Now, we've taken several precautions.
[00:39:37.486 --> 00:39:39.046]  Concealed handgun is needed.
[00:39:39.046 --> 00:39:41.487]  I mean, a concealed license is needed for the teacher.
[00:39:41.487 --> 00:39:44.848]  Then they have to be approved by the board, by name.
[00:39:44.848 --> 00:39:46.628]  Not position, but by name.
[00:39:47.228 --> 00:39:58.991]  And then, we were working on training, hostage, taking room clearance, shooting, a wide gamut, extensive training, okay?
[00:39:58.991 --> 00:40:04.932]  And then we're talking about having to be concealed on that person at all times, and it must be frangible ammunition.
[00:40:04.932 --> 00:40:07.453]  It's got to be ammunition that breaks apart when it hits a hard object.
[00:40:07.453 --> 00:40:08.613]  Yeah, the sear-shaped slugs.
[00:40:08.613 --> 00:40:11.014]  You don't want to go under a wall and kill children on the other side.
[00:40:11.674 --> 00:40:20.568]  So it's the type that are basically plastic bullets that have a metal casing around it, devastating to whoever you shoot, but won't go through a wall.
[00:40:22.732 --> 00:40:24.714]  So we've taken lots of precautions.
[00:40:24.714 --> 00:40:29.057]  And people have talked about, I know I have several reporters asking me, what if somebody takes that gun?
[00:40:29.057 --> 00:40:31.719]  Well, first of all, let's go back historically.
[00:40:31.719 --> 00:40:34.782]  And you were talking about the East Texas stories.
[00:40:34.782 --> 00:40:36.163]  There's all kinds of stories.
[00:40:36.163 --> 00:40:39.305]  Before 95, guns were allowed on campuses.
[00:40:39.305 --> 00:40:44.429]  And many school districts had individual rules, but basically there were guns on campuses.
[00:40:44.429 --> 00:40:50.314]  And there were no, there's no documented, anything documented from 95 on back.
[00:40:50.314 --> 00:40:50.774]  Exactly.
[00:40:52.115 --> 00:41:07.260]  And literally when my father grew up, this was even in big cities not just small towns, I mean during deer season, during other hunting seasons, there were just guys everywhere walking around putting their shotguns in their lockers because they would all get together and go hunting and you never had accidents because safety was taught.
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:22.931]  We were a better country then, I guess, and then they take the guns away and it creates a big giant red flashing sign saying, Victim Disarmament Zone, come here and you'll have a bunch of passive people because you're a coward and you know you can carry out your evil unopposed.
[00:41:23.391 --> 00:41:25.233]  That's right, and this is not just in Texas.
[00:41:25.233 --> 00:41:35.225]  I've heard a story of somebody up in the 60s and 70s in New York City, and they were in a shooting club, and they remember carrying their gun on the subway to school, coming to school, and showing their teacher their new gun.
[00:41:35.225 --> 00:41:37.527]  And the teacher, a woman, says, oh, that's neat.
[00:41:37.527 --> 00:41:40.791]  Look at the pistol I just bought and pulled one out of her purse.
[00:41:40.791 --> 00:41:42.113]  I said, this is stuff that's going on.
[00:41:42.113 --> 00:41:43.114]  This is what's happening.
[00:41:43.294 --> 00:41:53.039]  Hey, I'm not that old, but I remember, you know, up there with the history teacher and also the football coach, you know, showing off who's got the best old Henry pocketknives.
[00:41:53.039 --> 00:41:56.181]  You get caught with one of those now, they'll probably hang you.
[00:41:56.181 --> 00:41:59.902]  Well, what we've done is vilify the tools, not the people.
[00:41:59.902 --> 00:42:01.263]  And we need to do that.
[00:42:01.263 --> 00:42:08.307]  And what makes me mad about the liberal press, somebody tried to question me the other day about police officers missed two-thirds of the time.
[00:42:08.307 --> 00:42:10.548]  Well, that's only half the statistic.
[00:42:10.908 --> 00:42:15.654]  Alex, you know what you really need to say, they're coming in to a situation where they don't know what to think about it.
[00:42:15.654 --> 00:42:18.337]  Guns stop 14 million crimes a year.
[00:42:18.337 --> 00:42:24.365]  Bottom line, guns have saved millions of people every year and all the facts are there.
[00:42:25.106 --> 00:42:26.207]  That's right.
[00:42:26.207 --> 00:42:26.727]  That's right.
[00:42:26.727 --> 00:42:28.288]  And obviously, here we have it.
[00:42:28.288 --> 00:42:35.472]  If somebody can tell me, if somebody can tell me another solution, when you have an active shooter, I can lead them away from a fire.
[00:42:35.472 --> 00:42:37.294]  I can lead them away from a tornado.
[00:42:37.294 --> 00:42:40.996]  I can lead them away from a toxic spill on the railroad that runs near my school.
[00:42:40.996 --> 00:42:43.157]  I cannot lead them away from an active shooter.
[00:42:43.157 --> 00:42:45.239]  You don't take a knife to a gunfight.
[00:42:45.239 --> 00:42:46.519]  What else do you take?
[00:42:46.519 --> 00:42:49.001]  If somebody can tell me the technology, I'll take it.
[00:42:49.321 --> 00:42:53.664]  Well, if you get just three or four teachers that are armed, they're going to come at you with this.
[00:42:53.664 --> 00:42:56.006]  They're going to say, what if one of the teachers goes nuts?
[00:42:56.006 --> 00:42:58.648]  Well, that could happen anyways, and they're going to bring the gun.
[00:42:58.648 --> 00:43:00.009]  They're going to get in.
[00:43:00.009 --> 00:43:03.031]  God forbid, we don't really have any cases of that, but they're going to say that.
[00:43:03.031 --> 00:43:04.192]  They're already saying that.
[00:43:04.192 --> 00:43:05.613]  Well, the answer is yes.
[00:43:05.613 --> 00:43:10.977]  If a trusted person who's normally there gets through with it, we're going to have other people that are armed who can checkmate them.
[00:43:11.557 --> 00:43:12.498]  That's exactly right.
[00:43:12.498 --> 00:43:14.039]  You know, let's do a statistical thing.
[00:43:14.039 --> 00:43:20.463]  Let's say that we don't do anything with drug, I mean, the gun-free zones for the next decade, and we have as many shootings as we've had.
[00:43:20.463 --> 00:43:27.047]  Let's say that there are 10 in a 10-year period, and let's say that we average on average 10 deaths each time.
[00:43:27.047 --> 00:43:29.208]  That's 100 students that have died.
[00:43:29.208 --> 00:43:35.632]  Let's say that we implement some gun safety, and that stops the shootings, but we actually have two accidents.
[00:43:35.632 --> 00:43:37.253]  Let's say we kill two or three people.
[00:43:37.253 --> 00:43:39.194]  Well, just look at the hard, cold facts.
[00:43:39.893 --> 00:43:41.254]  We would have saved 97 lives.
[00:43:41.254 --> 00:43:44.435]  Well, I agree, but bottom line, it's about are we men or mice?
[00:43:44.435 --> 00:43:45.876]  Are we women or mice?
[00:43:45.876 --> 00:43:46.957]  Is this a free country?
[00:43:46.957 --> 00:43:48.457]  Do we have a Second Amendment?
[00:43:48.457 --> 00:43:53.640]  Are we going to give in to terrorists, give in to criminals, give in to schizophrenics, violent schizophrenics?
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:58.142]  Or are we going to go back to the culture of Davy Crockett and self-reliance that made this nation great?
[00:43:58.142 --> 00:44:02.565]  Are we going to teach our children that we're cowards and we just dial 911 and wait to die?
[00:44:02.565 --> 00:44:05.586]  Or are we going to teach them to stand up and take action?
[00:44:05.586 --> 00:44:06.887]  You're preaching to the choir.
[00:44:07.839 --> 00:44:12.580]  Well, it's beautiful, and what do you think when you got a positive response, mainly from this?
[00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:15.061]  I mean, I've seen the national polls.
[00:44:15.061 --> 00:44:19.902]  It was almost 50-50 15 years ago that the gun grabbers had kind of brainwashed the public.
[00:44:19.902 --> 00:44:30.165]  Now most polls show around 75% of the people are sick of the gun control, the victim disarmament, and arming teachers, arming college students, having guns in dorms.
[00:44:30.165 --> 00:44:34.066]  It's now becoming popular, and the gun grabbers are really getting frustrated right now.
[00:44:34.786 --> 00:44:37.349]  I was overwhelmed with the response that I'm getting.
[00:44:37.349 --> 00:44:41.192]  I'm getting emails all over the place, and I'm getting a few negatives.
[00:44:41.192 --> 00:44:48.098]  Obviously, you know, half the negatives are from Europe and other places, like UK and the Netherlands, who don't believe in guns.
[00:44:48.098 --> 00:44:55.025]  But it's overwhelming, Alex, and I would like to thank your listeners who are listening, who have sent those in to me, because it's been very encouraging.
[00:44:55.445 --> 00:44:59.387]  Because the liberal press is trying to put a bad spin on this, and I'm not going to let them.
[00:44:59.387 --> 00:45:01.148]  Because the arguments are not there.
[00:45:01.148 --> 00:45:02.468]  The evidence isn't there.
[00:45:02.468 --> 00:45:05.950]  All they can do is poo-poo the idea, but they cannot bring up evidence.
[00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:12.272]  All they can say is, this is the most dangerous idea in history, as Fallon is saying down in Houston.
[00:45:12.272 --> 00:45:13.053]  But you know what?
[00:45:13.053 --> 00:45:14.193]  She's not an expert on it.
[00:45:14.193 --> 00:45:15.274]  And you know what?
[00:45:15.274 --> 00:45:17.715]  I don't want to hear about it, because give me some reasons.
[00:45:17.715 --> 00:45:18.495]  I can take reasons.
[00:45:18.935 --> 00:45:25.100]  They are scared of the precedent that we are allowed to defend ourselves and that we have a right to defense.
[00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:39.151]  They are scared of, and listen, if we would have just implemented guns in the cockpits instead of taking them out as they did a few years before 9-11, if we would have implemented guns in the schools instead of taking them out in 95 as you said when all this started,
[00:45:39.551 --> 00:45:46.018]  Then we wouldn't need to have these schools be little mini prisons, and our children basically being, you know, trained to be in these little prisons.
[00:45:46.018 --> 00:45:54.066]  Instead of all the passive stuff, we needed to... So listen, you are really doing something revolutionary here, which just gets back to our American roots.
[00:45:54.838 --> 00:45:55.258]  That's right.
[00:45:55.258 --> 00:45:58.821]  Well, you know, it's sad that it has to be this way.
[00:45:58.821 --> 00:46:00.802]  Why in the world did we ever get to this point?
[00:46:00.802 --> 00:46:03.184]  And, you know, I want to know what we did before we had police officers.
[00:46:03.184 --> 00:46:05.025]  I don't think they came along until, like, the 1870s.
[00:46:05.025 --> 00:46:05.545]  That's right.
[00:46:05.545 --> 00:46:08.307]  New York started the first force in 1866.
[00:46:08.307 --> 00:46:08.407]  Right.
[00:46:14.431 --> 00:46:20.017]  So, and that's where we got the word copper, because they had worn copper badges, and then we copied them after London.
[00:46:20.017 --> 00:46:22.819]  And here's another interesting stat about London bobbies.
[00:46:22.819 --> 00:46:27.984]  They didn't carry guns until the 1970s or 80s, until they started disarming their people.
[00:46:29.065 --> 00:46:32.767]  The United States has exploded to the highest in Europe.
[00:46:32.767 --> 00:46:34.608]  Now, we have more murders in the U.S.
[00:46:34.608 --> 00:46:37.089]  per capita, but they have more muggings and woundings.
[00:46:37.089 --> 00:46:42.051]  They have now hundreds of knifings a week in England, murders.
[00:46:42.051 --> 00:46:47.034]  Look at Japan where these killers go in to shopping malls and kill 15 people with a knife.
[00:46:47.034 --> 00:46:49.995]  The answer is letting the people defend themselves.
[00:46:49.995 --> 00:46:56.538]  Instead of setting this monopoly of power where only the state has it, plus, sir, there's the danger of only having the government with the guns.
[00:46:56.538 --> 00:46:57.579]  That always leads to tyranny.
[00:46:58.019 --> 00:46:59.760]  That always does.
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:04.983]  And that's not... I love some blog that said the Second Amendment needs to be adjusted.
[00:47:04.983 --> 00:47:06.083]  Oh my goodness.
[00:47:06.083 --> 00:47:11.806]  I want to know how come we have to go to classes for the Second Amendment when we don't have to do it for freedom of speech or religion.
[00:47:11.806 --> 00:47:15.988]  You know, we don't have to go to classes in order to practice freedom of speech.
[00:47:15.988 --> 00:47:17.309]  The amendments are there.
[00:47:17.309 --> 00:47:22.532]  You know, you can't be talking about wanting to adjust them without changing the very way that we think in America.
[00:47:22.532 --> 00:47:25.914]  Look at the highest crime rates where they have victim disarmament.
[00:47:25.914 --> 00:47:26.514]  Chicago.
[00:47:27.134 --> 00:47:31.855]  DC, New York, where they have crime rates in some cases 100 plus percent higher.
[00:47:31.855 --> 00:47:41.017]  I mean, you don't have a lot of home invasions in Texas because they don't go in your house when you're there like they do in New York because they know half the households have got somebody waiting on the other side with a gun.
[00:47:41.017 --> 00:47:46.778]  And look where they've implemented concealed carry in Florida, in Texas, and in a dozen plus other states.
[00:47:46.778 --> 00:47:54.780]  On average, you can pull these numbers up, a 24% drop in carjackings, in-home invasions within one year.
[00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:57.982]  Yeah, yeah, it's immediate.
[00:47:57.982 --> 00:47:59.003]  The evidence is all there.
[00:47:59.003 --> 00:48:00.404]  So, sir, did you form this plan?
[00:48:00.404 --> 00:48:05.949]  I mean, what was the zenith or the genesis of this idea?
[00:48:05.949 --> 00:48:07.610]  I just, you know, it just made sense.
[00:48:07.610 --> 00:48:10.192]  I mean, it's just a matter of thinking things through.
[00:48:10.192 --> 00:48:14.596]  I've always been an outside-the-box thinker, and this is not the only thing we've done outside the box.
[00:48:14.596 --> 00:48:16.657]  I think we're the only school this size.
[00:48:16.657 --> 00:48:23.443]  I started reading research how that reading music and playing an instrument raises IQ 10 to 15 points permanently.
[00:48:23.763 --> 00:48:26.026]  And so, we started a jazz band program.
[00:48:26.026 --> 00:48:26.987]  Not a marching band.
[00:48:26.987 --> 00:48:28.028]  We don't need the numbers.
[00:48:28.028 --> 00:48:29.249]  We wanted the music.
[00:48:29.249 --> 00:48:32.673]  And this year, we started a K-4 individual piano lesson.
[00:48:32.673 --> 00:48:33.974]  We think outside the box.
[00:48:33.974 --> 00:48:35.075]  What's gonna work?
[00:48:35.075 --> 00:48:38.699]  Let's do something that is actually gonna work.
[00:48:38.699 --> 00:48:39.280]  And that's what we did.
[00:48:40.263 --> 00:48:46.105]  Now, have you been contacted by other school districts around the country or Texas that are interested in seeing what you've done?
[00:48:46.105 --> 00:48:59.729]  No, I think that, you know, it's really interesting in education that obviously there is a certain amount of, we want to stick together on a lot of stuff, but I think a lot of folks are kind of watching and seeing to see what happens.
[00:49:00.029 --> 00:49:06.154]  And I think a lot of people don't understand, and they've bought into all of the propaganda that guns are going to kill.
[00:49:06.154 --> 00:49:10.497]  And I mentioned to one of my friends that we were going to do it, and he said, well, what about the safety?
[00:49:10.497 --> 00:49:11.658]  And I said, what do you mean, the safety?
[00:49:11.658 --> 00:49:14.060]  He goes, you mean, are you talking about guns in the school?
[00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:14.821]  Yeah!
[00:49:14.821 --> 00:49:20.285]  Okay, automatically you think, oh my gosh, you have a gun there, it's going to go off, things are going to happen.
[00:49:20.285 --> 00:49:22.126]  Oh, they think that guns... That's what they automatically think.
[00:49:22.126 --> 00:49:25.049]  They think guns, like, have feet and crawl out of their holsters.
[00:49:26.429 --> 00:49:29.770]  And like have some evil agency to them.
[00:49:29.770 --> 00:49:39.191]  Well, look, I wouldn't put my children in any major city public school because they're federalized, they're dumbing them down, the drugging, the unhealthy food, the commercialism.
[00:49:39.191 --> 00:49:47.293]  There are some rural schools I'm aware of that if I did live in a rural area I might even have them go to public school because I know some of the principals and people that are involved.
[00:49:47.293 --> 00:49:53.534]  And those are the schools that continue to get the high scores almost as good as private and homeschooling because they're not under this
[00:49:53.974 --> 00:50:05.150]  Federal model, but I'll say this, this goes a long way towards making it a public school that you could put your children in, knowing that it's not a victim disarmament zone, a shooting gallery.
[00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:10.658]  And plus, all the media hype advertises the schools as a place for a nut to go to do this.
[00:50:10.658 --> 00:50:10.918]  Go ahead.
[00:50:11.659 --> 00:50:15.263]  I mean, just as a side note, it's funny that you mention the federal program.
[00:50:15.263 --> 00:50:17.165]  I do take some free and reduced money.
[00:50:17.165 --> 00:50:24.234]  We have a large class of low socioeconomic level students, but we don't take any title money.
[00:50:24.234 --> 00:50:24.895]  We don't do that.
[00:50:24.895 --> 00:50:27.198]  We don't do all the Nickleby stuff.
[00:50:27.198 --> 00:50:29.260]  But our scores, we have a recognized school.
[00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:30.582]  We're doing what's right for students.
[00:50:31.573 --> 00:50:33.314]  Well, I really appreciate you joining us.
[00:50:33.314 --> 00:50:39.178]  Is there a website people can visit to learn more about the Herald ISD, David?
[00:50:39.178 --> 00:50:43.000]  Well, it's heraldisd.net, and they can go to that.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.922]  It's two R's in Herald, and go to our new website.
[00:50:46.922 --> 00:50:55.447]  We're still in the process of trying to get it up and going, but it's, you know, we're just a small district just doing our job, and trying to do what's right for students.
[00:50:55.447 --> 00:50:58.269]  Superintendent David Thweatt, thank you for joining us.
[00:50:58.269 --> 00:50:59.830]  We'll check in with you as this unfolds.
[00:51:01.078 --> 00:51:01.919]  Question.
[00:51:01.919 --> 00:51:06.662]  Is the world getting better or vastly worse?
[00:51:06.662 --> 00:51:11.145]  A world economic collapse could come any day.
[00:51:11.145 --> 00:51:11.985]  Question.
[00:51:11.985 --> 00:51:17.249]  Are you prepared or are you ignoring the signs?
[00:51:17.249 --> 00:51:18.030]  Question.
[00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:21.672]  Do you have seven years of healthy food for your family?
[00:51:21.672 --> 00:51:21.912]  Answer.

[00:52:00.799 --> 00:52:01.759]  Hey, Clyde!
[00:52:01.759 --> 00:52:02.760]  What's up, Bonnie?
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:07.221]  Well, I got a question about those shielded, secure sleeves from Identity Stronghold.
[00:52:07.221 --> 00:52:11.963]  Yeah, the sleeves that block us from stealing account numbers from the new credit cards with RFID chips.
[00:52:11.963 --> 00:52:12.763]  What about them?
[00:52:12.763 --> 00:52:17.204]  Well, I mentioned them to our friends, and they want info on purchasing the secure sleeves.
[00:52:17.204 --> 00:52:18.225]  Oh, Bonnie!
[00:52:18.225 --> 00:52:24.727]  If everyone starts hearing about the secure sleeve, it'll destroy our plan to steal credit card numbers at the mall with my new RFID reader.
[00:52:24.727 --> 00:52:26.467]  I know, but these are our friends, Clyde.
[00:52:26.467 --> 00:52:28.028]  They promised not to tell anyone else.
[00:52:28.428 --> 00:52:29.389]  I guess you're right.
[00:52:29.389 --> 00:52:31.211]  That's what friends are for, I suppose.
[00:52:31.211 --> 00:52:36.977]  Tell them they can get a five-pack of secure sleeves that will fit credit cards and driver's licenses for $19.95.
[00:52:36.977 --> 00:52:42.342]  And Identity Stronghold also has a three-pack of secure sleeves for passport books for $14.95.
[00:52:42.342 --> 00:52:43.724]  And where do they buy them?
[00:52:43.724 --> 00:52:47.888]  They can buy them online or get a mail-in order form at IDStronghold.com.
[00:52:47.888 --> 00:52:50.070]  IDStronghold.com.
[00:52:50.070 --> 00:52:51.512]  Okay, well, what if they don't have the Internet?
[00:52:51.972 --> 00:52:52.772]  They can call 1-800-610-2770.
[00:52:52.772 --> 00:52:56.034]  That's 800-610-2770.
[00:52:56.034 --> 00:52:58.795]  Thanks, Clyde.
[00:52:58.795 --> 00:53:07.159]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:53:07.159 --> 00:53:08.820]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:11.342]  But who is the enemy?
[00:53:11.342 --> 00:53:12.142]  Bin Laden.
[00:53:12.142 --> 00:53:13.183]  This is his M.O.
[00:53:13.183 --> 00:53:14.524]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:53:14.524 --> 00:53:16.506]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:53:16.506 --> 00:53:23.652]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:53:23.652 --> 00:53:24.132]  Some U.S.
[00:53:24.132 --> 00:53:29.777]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:53:30.477 --> 00:53:33.980]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:36.142]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:54:03.891 --> 00:54:10.739]  Final segment with Superintendent of Herald ISD in North Texas, David Thweatt.
[00:54:10.739 --> 00:54:20.451]  David, in closing, the reason what you're doing is so important is it does set a precedent and it shows great courage in this gilded, emasculated society.
[00:54:21.424 --> 00:54:38.941]  Uh, the establishment, the UN, has said in treaties with the United States they want a monopoly of power by the state, and tyranny always comes in the form of a uniform in a government disarming its people, and this slide towards disarming us in threatens our entire way of life, but it also threatens the safety of our citizens, and so I want to thank you for being
[00:54:39.561 --> 00:54:45.628]  A true trailblazer, and I'm so proud that so much of the trailblazing we're seeing is happening in Texas.
[00:54:45.628 --> 00:54:47.350]  What was the response of the parents?
[00:54:47.350 --> 00:54:49.533]  I mean, did you first propose this to the school board?
[00:54:49.533 --> 00:54:51.935]  Was this done in an open setting?
[00:54:51.935 --> 00:54:53.657]  When did this debate about doing this start?
[00:54:54.538 --> 00:55:03.384]  I think it started, well, we passed it on October 22, 2007, and I think the debate started about a year and a half before that, as we discussed it and looked at it.
[00:55:03.384 --> 00:55:04.925]  We discussed it several times.
[00:55:04.925 --> 00:55:13.990]  I think, like I said, what drove us over the edge was, first of all, the Amish, and then I think Virginia Tech is what was, I think that was the final straw.
[00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:18.073]  And as we started looking at solving the real problems, and it was passed unanimously by our board.
[00:55:18.613 --> 00:55:29.880]  And the parents of our district, which aren't very many, but they have supported 100%, well, I say mostly 100%.
[00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:41.067]  There's a few that have qualms, but again, I think it's because, again, they have been duped by the media, and they haven't listened to the arguments.
[00:55:41.067 --> 00:55:43.949]  But a lot of our students come from outside the district.
[00:55:43.949 --> 00:55:44.729]  They choose to come here.
[00:55:46.599 --> 00:55:48.362]  I'm sure.
[00:55:48.362 --> 00:55:54.470]  When I travel to England or I travel to New York or Chicago, you see the criminal thug types all over the streets.
[00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:55.151]  They're arrogant.
[00:55:55.151 --> 00:55:56.853]  They look aggressively at you.
[00:55:56.853 --> 00:55:58.155]  You see them intimidating women.
[00:55:58.155 --> 00:56:01.179]  You know, as we said, hundreds of times higher muggings and killings.
[00:56:01.739 --> 00:56:09.162]  And then you go to another Texas city, or Arizona city, or Vermont city, or Florida city, where you've got armed citizenry and the crooks are scared!
[00:56:09.162 --> 00:56:15.284]  I mean, what can't the domesticated people out there, who've never been around a gun, understand about that?
[00:56:15.284 --> 00:56:22.086]  I mean, why do they feel safe when they see a police officer with a gun, but then they don't feel safe when they see a... I mean, now even in Texas, you try to drive with a deer rifle,
[00:56:22.586 --> 00:56:24.429]  In your gun rack, the cops pull you over.
[00:56:24.429 --> 00:56:31.700]  I mean, how did we overnight turn into this idea of guns being in citizens' hands are so scary, and I see you turning the tide?
[00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:33.441]  I don't know.
[00:56:33.441 --> 00:56:34.882]  I really wish I knew.
[00:56:34.882 --> 00:56:38.765]  I think, as you've talked about it, we just want to be a bunch of victims.
[00:56:38.765 --> 00:56:43.489]  We don't want to take the power back into our own lives.
[00:56:43.489 --> 00:56:44.169]  But you know what?
[00:56:44.169 --> 00:56:46.551]  In rural America, we have to do that.
[00:56:46.551 --> 00:56:48.033]  We have to take care of business.
[00:56:48.033 --> 00:56:51.015]  We can't wait around for somebody else to solve the problem for us.
[00:56:51.015 --> 00:56:54.298]  We are our only solution, and we help each other out.
[00:56:54.298 --> 00:56:55.619]  But you know, you have to protect yourself.
[00:56:57.108 --> 00:56:59.189]  And we have seen some nuts in rural areas.
[00:56:59.189 --> 00:57:02.932]  That's where a lot of your shootings have happened, and it's very important what you're doing.
[00:57:02.932 --> 00:57:07.554]  And I think you can get rid of the prison door and the cameras.
[00:57:07.554 --> 00:57:11.076]  I know you're doing that because that's what the feds called for and what was pushed, the money that was offered.
[00:57:11.076 --> 00:57:18.100]  But I really think if you arm four or five teachers, your problem's solved and we can go back to Mayberry RFD.
[00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:22.303]  We really commend you, David Thweatt, Herald ISD Superintendent.
[00:57:22.303 --> 00:57:23.544]  Godspeed.
[00:57:23.544 --> 00:57:24.184]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:57:24.184 --> 00:57:24.924]  Appreciate it.
[00:57:24.924 --> 00:57:25.285]  You bet.
[00:57:25.285 --> 00:57:25.645]  God bless.
[00:57:27.325 --> 00:57:32.249]  Okay, folks, there he goes.
[00:57:32.249 --> 00:57:34.910]  And I appreciate my producer getting him on the broadcast.
[00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:37.252]  He's going to be on Glenn Beck today, later.
[00:57:37.252 --> 00:57:41.735]  So we got him first.
[00:57:41.735 --> 00:57:45.838]  Okay, I got a big stack of important news here that I want to go over.
[00:57:48.979 --> 00:58:09.267]  There has also been more dangerous disinformation in the Patriot movement aimed at myself and Ted Anderson, and so at the bottom of this hour I am just going to, in a nebulous fashion, briefly address it because it is this type of rot-gut poison that stalls and brings down movements, at least on a local front.
[00:58:09.267 --> 00:58:12.649]  So I'll have about a two-minute comment on the
[00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:17.583]  I don't know, delusional, treachery, craziness.
[00:58:17.583 --> 00:58:20.706]  A lot of people are so obsessed with me, it's getting worse and worse.
[00:58:20.706 --> 00:58:27.733]  I mean, I'm really getting to where I don't want to go to events, I don't want to even do this anymore, sometimes.
[00:58:27.733 --> 00:58:30.255]  Because I hate being the center of attention.
[00:58:30.255 --> 00:58:38.122]  And I can't stand all these other people in the movement who literally eat, drink, and sleep Alex Jones, and so they want to hate me, so they invent stuff to hate me about.
[00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:43.470]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:43.470 --> 00:58:51.196]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:51.196 --> 00:58:56.901]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:58:56.901 --> 00:58:58.222]  And we knew what to do.
[00:58:58.222 --> 00:59:00.224]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:59:00.224 --> 00:59:06.589]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:59:07.256 --> 00:59:16.161]  Whitman, EPA director, on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:59:16.161 --> 00:59:23.246]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:59:23.246 --> 00:59:26.408]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:59:26.408 --> 00:59:31.491]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:59:32.171 --> 00:59:35.273]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:53.426]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:59:53.426 --> 00:59:55.828]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.828 --> 00:59:58.590]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.063 --> 01:00:06.364]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.364 --> 01:00:08.124]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.124 --> 01:00:09.885]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.885 --> 01:00:11.466]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.466 --> 01:00:13.026]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.026 --> 01:00:17.208]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.208 --> 01:00:22.290]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.290 --> 01:00:27.792]  Sidney Sheehan running for the House of Representatives against Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi joins us in T-minus two hours.
[01:00:32.308 --> 01:00:37.596]  A whole bunch of thermite explosives experts and intelligence operatives running it.
[01:00:37.596 --> 01:00:44.546]  A couple months ago, their final report was leaked and they admitted it was their report and were very mad about it being leaked.
[01:00:44.546 --> 01:00:48.031]  By leaked, their website was basically hacked.
[01:00:51.178 --> 01:00:52.259]  And it was brought forward.
[01:00:52.259 --> 01:00:56.482]  So we already have the report, and then they scurried around and were trying to revise it.
[01:00:56.482 --> 01:00:57.823]  That is coming out Thursday.
[01:00:57.823 --> 01:01:11.253]  Now, they said they were going to release this in 2005, 2006, 2007, early 2008, and then now they're saying they're doing it, and they've announced before they're going to release it in a few days, and then they have to get their lies straight and don't.
[01:01:11.253 --> 01:01:14.816]  But it'll probably be very similar to the last draft report.
[01:01:14.816 --> 01:01:16.177]  They're calling this one a draft.
[01:01:16.177 --> 01:01:18.799]  It's always a draft, so they can change lies.
[01:01:18.799 --> 01:01:20.340]  In the report, they say that, uh,
[01:01:21.064 --> 01:01:26.007]  They don't know why the towers fell, and it wasn't the fuel oil tank, it wasn't bad construction, it wasn't fire.
[01:01:26.007 --> 01:01:27.288]  We'll see what they do here.
[01:01:27.288 --> 01:01:32.671]  Also, that 25% of the building was not scooped out.
[01:01:32.671 --> 01:01:33.832]  That's all admitted.
[01:01:33.832 --> 01:01:37.294]  Back in Fayetteville, we have the front of the building they say was scooped out, and nothing's scooped out.
[01:01:37.294 --> 01:01:40.296]  A few windows are knocked out on the bottom floor.
[01:01:40.296 --> 01:01:41.197]  Boy, that's scooped out!
[01:01:41.952 --> 01:01:43.354]  We have video inside of there.
[01:01:43.354 --> 01:01:44.536]  It's just incredible deception.
[01:01:44.536 --> 01:01:49.583]  I'm lining up Kevin Ryan, Stephen Jones, and others to talk about this Thursday and Friday.
[01:01:49.583 --> 01:01:51.225]  We're gonna have Burmess pop in.
[01:01:51.225 --> 01:01:55.491]  All next week, Burmess is gonna be in studio.
[01:01:55.491 --> 01:01:58.896]  I am going to be driving out to Denver this weekend.
[01:01:59.591 --> 01:02:07.036]  And I'll be there on the ground, because that's gonna be probably where the fireworks are, where the police state, the secret camp, and the rest of it, and I pray I don't get arrested.
[01:02:07.036 --> 01:02:12.579]  I'm really getting tired of getting manhandled and taken to jail and slammed around, but we'll see what happens.
[01:02:12.579 --> 01:02:23.386]  This country's so far gone, you try to videotape cops from a hundred yards away, they just come over and talk to you like you're a pile of horse manure and just, with pleasure, arrest you.
[01:02:23.386 --> 01:02:26.568]  So, I just feel sorry for them when they're doing it.
[01:02:26.568 --> 01:02:28.950]  This country's so far gone, I just want to resuscitate it.
[01:02:32.884 --> 01:02:34.544]  I was having nightmares all last night.
[01:02:34.544 --> 01:02:40.246]  I was on coast-to-coast AM, and then I went to sleep.
[01:02:40.246 --> 01:02:45.727]  And I was just having these nightmares all... It was like case after case.
[01:02:45.727 --> 01:02:47.988]  You know, you ever have dreams where they just go on all night?
[01:02:47.988 --> 01:02:49.288]  It's not just glimpses of dreams.
[01:02:49.288 --> 01:02:54.110]  It's like long, drawn-out dreams.
[01:02:54.110 --> 01:02:57.991]  And it wasn't my children, except in one of the dreams, being grabbed by CPS.
[01:02:57.991 --> 01:02:59.331]  It was other people's children.
[01:03:02.787 --> 01:03:15.274]  And the dreams were so detailed, it'd be like I'd have a bird's-eye view of a guy pulled over who has an expired driver's license for whatever reason.
[01:03:15.274 --> 01:03:25.900]  And the police find out he's got an expired driver's license, and then they take the two, you know, three and five years old, it looked like, children out of the back of the car.
[01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:31.003]  They're crying, they put them in a CPS van, and the father is taken to jail and the car is impounded.
[01:03:31.613 --> 01:03:49.324]  And then it would be inside the CPS facility, with these sacks of pus, and I'd be looking at their faces in the dream, and watching them interrogate the kids, and not give them food until they lie about their parents, and the CPS with dolls, saying, do they touch you here?
[01:03:52.506 --> 01:04:02.296]  And then of course children have all been cleaned or had their diapers changed and they say yes and then the children being taken and then it would cut back on the dreams of parents crying and freaking out and it went on.
[01:04:02.296 --> 01:04:04.458]  It was like years of this last night.
[01:04:04.458 --> 01:04:05.660]  I was just seeing all this evil.
[01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:10.625]  Of course it was manufactured in my mind but it was all based on real cases of what they really do.
[01:04:12.139 --> 01:04:15.441]  Then I woke up at like 6.38 saying I gotta get out of this country.
[01:04:15.441 --> 01:04:16.102]  I gotta get out of here.
[01:04:16.102 --> 01:04:17.162]  I gotta get out of here.
[01:04:17.162 --> 01:04:22.505]  HempUSA.org is now offering free shipping worldwide to better serve our customers.

[01:04:38.255 --> 01:04:38.695]  I think so.
[01:05:05.586 --> 01:05:08.807]  Why does our government not allow this crop to grow in the US?
[01:05:08.807 --> 01:05:11.328]  This product is also great for pets and animals.

[01:05:16.329 --> 01:05:20.230]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:23.712]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:05:23.712 --> 01:05:26.352]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:05:26.352 --> 01:05:27.893]  But who is the enemy?
[01:05:27.893 --> 01:05:28.693]  Bin Laden.
[01:05:28.693 --> 01:05:29.653]  This is his ammo.
[01:05:29.653 --> 01:05:31.054]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:05:31.054 --> 01:05:31.794]  We have to look to Israel.
[01:05:31.894 --> 01:05:35.939]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[01:05:35.939 --> 01:05:37.941]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:05:50.737 --> 01:06:00.999]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:06:00.999 --> 01:06:02.239]  Fabled enemies.

[01:07:39.988 --> 01:07:44.010]  Nukes unlikely to be affected by Musharraf leaving.
[01:07:44.010 --> 01:07:52.272]  Associated Press, Brezhnev's departure from the presidency is unlikely to have a significant impact on how Pakistan's nuclear weapons are controlled.
[01:07:52.272 --> 01:07:58.014]  Experts say a 10-member committee, and not just the president, make decisions on how to use them and how to complete
[01:07:59.483 --> 01:08:01.364]  Meltdown in governance.
[01:08:01.364 --> 01:08:08.709]  And only a complete meltdown in governance, still a distant prospect in Pakistan, could put the atomic bomb in the hands of extremists.
[01:08:08.709 --> 01:08:18.715]  Pakistan's nuclear assets are not one man's property, said Maria Sultan, a defense analyst and director of the London-based South Asia Strategic Stability Institute.
[01:08:18.715 --> 01:08:27.201]  Any politician in transition into Pakistan will have no effect on Pakistan's nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control.
[01:08:28.829 --> 01:08:40.435]  The committee known as the National Command Authority is served by a military-dominated organization with thousands of security forces and intelligence agents whose personnel are closely screened.
[01:08:40.435 --> 01:08:43.316]  The nuclear facilities are tightly guarded.
[01:08:43.316 --> 01:08:44.757]  Now, let me just give you the facts.
[01:08:44.757 --> 01:08:49.199]  You can go pull all this up if you'd like.
[01:08:49.199 --> 01:08:53.301]  The United States and England, as well as some help from Israel, but mainly England and the U.S.,
[01:08:54.221 --> 01:09:07.774]  In the mid-90s began giving AQ Khan Laboratories, based in Pakistan as their front, the components, the centrifuges, the materials to successfully build atomic bombs.
[01:09:07.774 --> 01:09:16.443]  Then, the West, England, the U.S., Israel again, helped give them the medium-range missiles that have 3,000 kilometer ranges.
[01:09:19.241 --> 01:09:23.425]  That's more than 2,000 mile ranges.
[01:09:23.425 --> 01:09:32.673]  You can draw a 2,200, 300 mile circle and you can go look at different geopolitical and governmental sites that break this down.
[01:09:32.673 --> 01:09:40.820]  You can see, or just type into Google, the nuclear reach of Pakistan's missiles or the reach of Pakistan's nuclear-tipped missiles.
[01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:42.041]  You can pull up all those maps.
[01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:45.761]  But they can hit a lot of countries.
[01:09:45.761 --> 01:09:46.722]  They can hit Russia.
[01:09:46.722 --> 01:09:47.662]  They can hit India.
[01:09:47.662 --> 01:09:49.903]  They can hit China.
[01:09:49.903 --> 01:09:51.564]  They can hit Iran.
[01:09:51.564 --> 01:09:53.105]  But they can reach out further than that.
[01:09:53.105 --> 01:09:55.106]  They can hit Israel.
[01:09:55.106 --> 01:09:57.528]  But that's supposedly okay.
[01:09:57.528 --> 01:10:01.370]  That's supposedly alright if they can hit Turkey.
[01:10:01.370 --> 01:10:03.971]  It's okay if they can hit Georgia.
[01:10:03.971 --> 01:10:10.275]  It's okay if they can hit Afghanistan and scores of other nations.
[01:10:10.275 --> 01:10:10.915]  That's alright.
[01:10:13.032 --> 01:10:30.788]  It's a nuclear Iran that we have to worry about, the media tells us, when Iran has been totally inspected by the UN, given into global government, has no nuclear program, but the AP and everybody else running these deceptive headlines every day saying, Israel may attack Iran's nukes!
[01:10:30.788 --> 01:10:39.336]  And then in the bottom of the article it says, peaceful reactors that can't be used to purify uranium to a level to be used in the crudest of weapons.
[01:10:42.586 --> 01:10:48.088]  Just a fact, but why give the public the facts when you can tell them that Russia attacked Georgia?
[01:10:48.088 --> 01:10:54.791]  Or you can tell the public that there's never been mercury in vaccines and later admit there's mercury in vaccines and say it's good for you.
[01:10:54.791 --> 01:11:00.033]  And they just lie, lie, lie, or say that vaccines are the law to take when it's not the law.
[01:11:00.033 --> 01:11:06.796]  And I use that as an example just of the, or there are WMDs in Iraq and create fake Niger uranium documents.
[01:11:08.638 --> 01:11:09.998]  They just lie, lie, lie.
[01:11:09.998 --> 01:11:25.323]  If you had a neighbor, if you had a spouse, if you had a cousin, if you had a business partner who lied and lied and lied and lied and lied and lied and lied and lied and lied and lied and cheated and backstabbed, wouldn't you stop dealing with them?
[01:11:25.323 --> 01:11:26.644]  Well, actually, no.
[01:11:26.644 --> 01:11:33.466]  It's not just that we've become acclimated to accepting lies by our own government and lies by our local governments.
[01:11:34.235 --> 01:11:42.661]  We've now accepted lies from our bosses, and lies from our employees, and lies from our spouses, and lies from our neighbors, and lies from the media.
[01:11:42.661 --> 01:11:50.347]  It's just become a, yeah, they all lie, but then no one really knows what the truth is, and just doesn't do any studying, and just kind of says, oh, you can't believe anything.
[01:11:50.347 --> 01:11:55.891]  And that's the more astute people.
[01:11:55.891 --> 01:12:01.795]  More often than not, you run into populations who say, well, I choose the reality I want to believe.
[01:12:01.795 --> 01:12:03.296]  I choose to believe Barack Obama.
[01:12:04.076 --> 01:12:05.517]  I choose to believe John McCain.
[01:12:05.517 --> 01:12:07.517]  I choose to believe that they run things.
[01:12:07.517 --> 01:12:08.898]  Or, that's one lie.
[01:12:08.898 --> 01:12:10.559]  Or I choose to believe they're not puppets.
[01:12:10.559 --> 01:12:12.219]  I choose to believe they're good guys.
[01:12:12.219 --> 01:12:17.541]  I choose to believe that George Bush is a good Christian conservative.
[01:12:17.541 --> 01:12:27.525]  I choose to believe Bush when he tells me that they're not having warrantless spying on American people and he promised in press conferences that it came out a month later he was lying and then said, okay, we are spying on you retroactively.
[01:12:27.525 --> 01:12:28.946]  Pass a law so we're not felons.
[01:12:31.132 --> 01:12:36.115]  We accept the lies when Denver says there's no secret camp a week and a half ago.
[01:12:36.115 --> 01:12:37.496]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[01:12:37.496 --> 01:12:38.156]  That was in the news.
[01:12:38.156 --> 01:12:42.839]  Oh, there's rumors of secret roundup plans and secret detention centers.
[01:12:42.839 --> 01:12:45.661]  People say, well, wait a minute, there's federal grants for this.
[01:12:45.661 --> 01:12:47.722]  Oh, they found the location to the grant.
[01:12:47.722 --> 01:12:48.922]  They went out there.
[01:12:48.922 --> 01:12:50.343]  Local independent media.
[01:12:50.343 --> 01:12:51.304]  We are changing others.
[01:12:52.276 --> 01:13:01.944]  And there they are, can hold 5,000 people, barbed wire fences inside, Constantino wire, and it says electroshock devices used in this area.
[01:13:01.944 --> 01:13:03.345]  Letting you know, we're going to shock you.
[01:13:03.345 --> 01:13:04.346]  There's signs up.
[01:13:04.346 --> 01:13:09.190]  We're going to put you in a camp you couldn't keep dogs or horses in, and we're going to shock you.
[01:13:09.190 --> 01:13:15.176]  We're going to drive buses in and run them to make you sick, and the cops stand around laughing outside where everybody vomits.
[01:13:15.176 --> 01:13:16.737]  We're going to hit you with carbon monoxide.
[01:13:17.327 --> 01:13:18.707]  We're going to have people go to the hospital!
[01:13:18.707 --> 01:13:24.189]  We're going to put you in a 70 year old bus terminal with 3 inches of chemicals on it!
[01:13:24.189 --> 01:13:26.790]  And I went to the New York Jail when they were releasing them.
[01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:28.671]  After 2 days in the camp.
[01:13:28.671 --> 01:13:29.791]  Pier 57.
[01:13:29.791 --> 01:13:33.532]  And I watched the huge boils and red chemical burns.
[01:13:33.532 --> 01:13:35.833]  And it's all real funny.
[01:13:35.833 --> 01:13:37.873]  And I'd walk up.
[01:13:37.873 --> 01:13:38.574]  100 and something yards.
[01:13:38.574 --> 01:13:39.734]  It's all in martial law.
[01:13:40.930 --> 01:13:42.691]  9-1-1, rise of the police state.
[01:13:42.691 --> 01:13:43.612]  Cop comes over.
[01:13:43.612 --> 01:13:45.994]  I'm across two streets, behind barricades, videotaping.
[01:13:45.994 --> 01:13:47.895]  He runs over and goes, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
[01:13:47.895 --> 01:13:49.957]  GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!
[01:13:49.957 --> 01:13:50.677]  What are you doing here?
[01:13:50.677 --> 01:13:51.458]  Well, we're here for this.
[01:13:51.458 --> 01:13:58.463]  I TOLD YOU, SHUT UP!
[01:13:58.463 --> 01:14:00.885]  I told you, shut up.
[01:14:00.885 --> 01:14:01.705]  That's America.
[01:14:01.705 --> 01:14:03.327]  They did the same thing.
[01:14:03.327 --> 01:14:05.568]  Though we are changed.
[01:14:05.568 --> 01:14:07.029]  They told CBS, get out of here.
[01:14:07.029 --> 01:14:07.690]  This is secret.
[01:14:08.496 --> 01:14:13.020]  You, the slaves, you see the police call us civilians.
[01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:15.222]  That's military terminology.
[01:14:15.222 --> 01:14:17.664]  Mayors call us, governors call us civilians.
[01:14:17.664 --> 01:14:21.728]  They've been introduced to a military terminology, military culture.
[01:14:21.728 --> 01:14:29.715]  Now the FEMA emergency centers are in every city merging the police departments under federal control with the firemen and emergency management.
[01:14:31.883 --> 01:14:40.430]  The Washington Post comes out Friday and says, yeah, they're about to pass a law openly turning the local departments into intelligence agencies to spy on the citizens.
[01:14:40.430 --> 01:14:42.892]  It's already going on criminally.
[01:14:42.892 --> 01:14:49.156]  They're already breaking the law, having the military and the state police spy on anybody and everybody, unless they're real terrorists.
[01:14:49.156 --> 01:14:59.084]  I mean, if you're real hijackers, you know, working at military bases and riding around with Nick Berg, who later got his head sawed off, and all the rest is, oh, that's all ignored.
[01:14:59.685 --> 01:15:10.333]  If you call the FBI 50 times saying these people are hijackers, they plan to attack, the FBI was told stand down because no, those were just agents out to parrot and quote test security is what they've been told.
[01:15:10.333 --> 01:15:16.937]  Just like the Navy SEALs and the FBI and others practice attacking their own embassies, practice trying to sneak bombs through airports.
[01:15:16.937 --> 01:15:17.918]  See, that's the cover story.
[01:15:18.777 --> 01:15:21.278]  And if I was you, police and military, I wouldn't take part in those drills.
[01:15:21.278 --> 01:15:29.563]  Because sometimes, they're going to have you really go on the plane, and then it's going to blow up, and they're going to say, Tom Jones, or Bill Simon, or whatever the hypothetical name is.
[01:15:29.563 --> 01:15:31.904]  Yeah, he was a white American Al Qaeda.
[01:15:31.904 --> 01:15:35.166]  He went on the plane and blew it up.
[01:15:35.166 --> 01:15:36.327]  And you're taking part in the drill.
[01:15:36.327 --> 01:15:43.771]  That's one of their favorite ways to set you up.
[01:15:43.771 --> 01:15:46.852]  We're dealing with some smart devils here.
[01:15:46.852 --> 01:15:47.953]  But I already digress.
[01:15:49.511 --> 01:15:51.493]  Pakistan is completely run by U.S.
[01:15:51.493 --> 01:15:53.114]  and British intelligence.
[01:15:53.114 --> 01:15:54.296]  The military runs it.
[01:15:54.296 --> 01:15:56.297]  Musharraf was just a front man.
[01:15:56.297 --> 01:16:05.346]  The people don't want him anymore, so they're gonna put a new front man in front of everybody's eyes.
[01:16:05.346 --> 01:16:07.328]  Period.
[01:16:07.328 --> 01:16:07.688]  Period.
[01:16:11.952 --> 01:16:21.399]  The committee known as the National Command Authority is served by a military-dominated organization with thousands of security forces and intelligence agents whose personnel are closely screened.
[01:16:21.399 --> 01:16:23.460]  Britain's been running that country for 150 years.
[01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:25.442]  The nuclear facilities are tightly guarded.
[01:16:25.442 --> 01:16:28.304]  The reality is that Pakistan's government exists on different levels.
[01:16:28.304 --> 01:16:32.947]  One is the level existed and works in the control of its nuclear weapons.
[01:16:32.947 --> 01:16:34.268]  See, that's the shadow government.
[01:16:34.268 --> 01:16:35.889]  That's the cognitive government.
[01:16:35.889 --> 01:16:36.910]  Same thing here.
[01:16:36.910 --> 01:16:41.433]  And it was cognitive government that ran the 9-11 attacks with their clients out of England and Israel.
[01:16:43.268 --> 01:16:44.950]  And some major defense contractors.
[01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:50.857]  And that's what Jason Burmiss' new film, Fabled Enemies, now available.
[01:16:50.857 --> 01:16:54.061]  It covers Israel, Pakistan, England, how they all nexus together.
[01:16:55.041 --> 01:16:56.342]  One Motley Crue, U.S.
[01:16:56.342 --> 01:16:59.503]  intelligence, carrying out the attacks.
[01:16:59.503 --> 01:17:01.224]  You want to know how it was done?
[01:17:01.224 --> 01:17:02.485]  You want to know how they did it?
[01:17:02.485 --> 01:17:03.525]  This film covers it.
[01:17:03.525 --> 01:17:06.206]  You can order it now at InfoWars.com.
[01:17:06.206 --> 01:17:08.327]  Fabled Enemies ships in just 12 days.
[01:17:08.327 --> 01:17:13.149]  You'll be able to see it September 1st at PrisonPlanet.tv in super high quality.
[01:17:13.149 --> 01:17:17.652]  Get your membership today, only 15 cents a day, and see Terror Storm, an in-game and
[01:17:19.241 --> 01:17:24.963]  Truth Rising and my weekly TV reports and get the last hour of the show that we always do as a live video feed.
[01:17:24.963 --> 01:17:25.863]  We have other special guests.
[01:17:25.863 --> 01:17:35.085]  Sometimes we've done four hours of a live video feed for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers with the video cam, the document cam, exclusive video streamed at PrisonPlanet.TV live first.
[01:17:35.085 --> 01:17:39.847]  We also archive the hour we do everyday live, sometimes more, at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:17:39.847 --> 01:17:42.367]  Sunday's show we videotape and put up on the web.
[01:17:42.367 --> 01:17:45.268]  The local TV show I did.
[01:17:45.268 --> 01:17:48.369]  All of it with your PrisonPlanet.TV membership and yes,
[01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:58.006]  Your support of PrisonPlanet.tv funds the servers and so much of what we do.
[01:17:58.006 --> 01:18:00.849]  And this isn't your daddy's internet.
[01:18:00.849 --> 01:18:06.114]  We've got two big CDNs, content distribution networks, that are very expensive.
[01:18:06.114 --> 01:18:09.016]  The CDNs alone are $14,000 a month.
[01:18:10.737 --> 01:18:19.859]  The money comes in here and it goes right back out, ladies and gentlemen, to give PrisonPlanet.tv members the best videos, the best downloads, in super high quality.
[01:18:19.859 --> 01:18:24.320]  And then we use those CDNs to power the other sites, and without it we couldn't operate.
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:29.942]  So I want to thank all of you out there for your support as PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[01:18:31.232 --> 01:18:32.513]  And we're trying to up the ante.
[01:18:32.513 --> 01:18:36.716]  We're trying to gear up the new office and get the personnel in and move forward.
[01:18:36.716 --> 01:18:40.518]  But we have such a skeleton crew that it's so hard to even hire the new people.
[01:18:40.518 --> 01:18:41.799]  I'm not complaining.
[01:18:41.799 --> 01:18:43.961]  I'm saying we're moving as fast as we can.
[01:18:43.961 --> 01:18:44.781]  It's easy to dream.
[01:18:44.781 --> 01:18:45.882]  It's easy to talk.
[01:18:45.882 --> 01:18:48.904]  It's hard to actually get things done.
[01:18:48.904 --> 01:18:56.309]  Especially when you have packs of do-nothing, ne'er-do-wells, who I never even think about, ranging around schizophrenically, thinking I'm obsessing on them.
[01:18:57.407 --> 01:18:58.448]  Doing something to them.
[01:18:58.448 --> 01:18:59.229]  I could care less.
[01:18:59.229 --> 01:19:02.211]  All these rinky-dink other networks and other hosts.
[01:19:02.211 --> 01:19:05.954]  I mean, one of my YouTube videos every day is bigger than what you do in a week.
[01:19:05.954 --> 01:19:06.834]  All of you combined.
[01:19:06.834 --> 01:19:07.695]  It's a joke.
[01:19:07.695 --> 01:19:08.836]  We dwarf you.
[01:19:08.836 --> 01:19:12.278]  It's like we're the planet Jupiter and you're a tiny asteroid.
[01:19:12.278 --> 01:19:12.759]  Get it?
[01:19:12.759 --> 01:19:13.960]  We don't care about you.
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:15.601]  We're moving forward against the New World Order.
[01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:30.872]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:19:30.872 --> 01:19:34.695]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.

[01:20:26.862 --> 01:20:32.304]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[01:20:32.304 --> 01:20:42.828]  Though the people of the U.S., where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reigning them in and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[01:20:43.308 --> 01:20:47.709]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[01:20:47.709 --> 01:20:50.490]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[01:20:50.490 --> 01:20:54.051]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[01:20:54.051 --> 01:21:06.574]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the Earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.

[01:22:17.438 --> 01:22:19.180]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:19.521]  August 19, 2008.
[01:22:19.521 --> 01:22:20.302]  Gold opened at $786.70.
[01:22:20.302 --> 01:22:23.626]  One ounce gold coins can be purchased for $810.59, $399.55 for half ounce, and $199.78 for quarter ounce.
[01:22:23.626 --> 01:22:24.127]  That's $810.59, $399.55, and $199.78.
[01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:47.308]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11,110, was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[01:22:47.308 --> 01:22:50.490]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[01:22:50.490 --> 01:22:53.852]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[01:22:53.852 --> 01:22:56.654]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[01:22:56.914 --> 01:22:59.735]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[01:22:59.735 --> 01:23:02.637]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:23:02.637 --> 01:23:04.918]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[01:23:04.918 --> 01:23:05.758]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:23:05.758 --> 01:23:11.541]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[01:23:11.541 --> 01:23:11.721]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:21.935 --> 01:23:26.898]  To this world we're born.
[01:23:26.898 --> 01:23:29.760]  To this world we're thrown.
[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:40.167]  Think about the majesty of life when you realize how small and pathetic these New World Order people are.
[01:23:52.221 --> 01:23:53.142]  Think about it.
[01:23:53.142 --> 01:24:06.671]  We are creatures living on a gorgeous planet with all these life forms, beautiful deep seas, a giant stone moon orbiting, flying through space.
[01:24:06.671 --> 01:24:08.292]  Just think of that image.
[01:24:08.292 --> 01:24:09.973]  Ah!
[01:24:09.973 --> 01:24:11.194]  Man!
[01:24:11.194 --> 01:24:14.996]  And then none of it matters, does it?
[01:24:14.996 --> 01:24:17.158]  All that matters is life and goodness and decency.
[01:24:19.116 --> 01:24:27.401]  Of course, those lives are over for ten French paratroopers because they've got to guard the opium.
[01:24:27.401 --> 01:24:29.682]  And pull up the international numbers on this.
[01:24:29.682 --> 01:24:32.324]  Eight-fold increase as of last year's numbers.
[01:24:32.324 --> 01:24:33.565]  The new ones aren't out.
[01:24:33.565 --> 01:24:34.685]  And it grows every year.
[01:24:34.685 --> 01:24:35.125]  Record!
[01:24:35.125 --> 01:24:36.766]  Biggest ever!
[01:24:36.766 --> 01:24:44.351]  In the hundreds of years they've been shipping opium out of Afghanistan that has then turned into heroin, purified, concentrated.
[01:24:46.690 --> 01:24:49.992]  It is just pouring out, smack!
[01:24:49.992 --> 01:24:59.516]  Heroin is just pouring out all over the streets of Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, the United States.
[01:24:59.516 --> 01:25:03.758]  And I've talked to the troops that come home, but it's come out in news and it shows the images.
[01:25:03.758 --> 01:25:05.479]  They'll spin it and say, U.S.
[01:25:05.479 --> 01:25:06.400]  Marines, U.S.
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:12.983]  Army, French troops guard poppy fields from the Taliban.
[01:25:14.838 --> 01:25:16.923]  And you read it, just kind of hidden right out in plain view.
[01:25:16.923 --> 01:25:22.877]  Kind of like Richard Grasso, head of the New York Stock Exchange in 99, in Reuters and other newspapers.
[01:25:22.877 --> 01:25:24.460]  He went down, had a meeting with the fart gorillas.
[01:25:25.106 --> 01:25:31.390]  They finally killed the guy they promised they would if he didn't invest the drug money out of Columbia, the communist drug money, in the New York Stock Exchange.
[01:25:31.390 --> 01:25:34.812]  You know it's illegal for drug money to be invested as long as it's offshore and brought in.
[01:25:34.812 --> 01:25:35.292]  That's right.
[01:25:35.292 --> 01:25:37.053]  They have all special rules for themselves.
[01:25:37.053 --> 01:25:43.017]  Richard Grasso hugged the head of the FARC and said, invest your tens of billions a month with us, or you'll be invaded.
[01:25:43.017 --> 01:25:44.918]  And he didn't go along with it, so U.S.
[01:25:44.918 --> 01:25:47.580]  troops then invaded and thousands of U.S.
[01:25:47.580 --> 01:25:49.441]  troops have died there.
[01:25:49.441 --> 01:25:50.742]  It's all just kept quiet, but
[01:25:51.371 --> 01:25:52.671]  Talk to any of the troops that come back.
[01:25:52.671 --> 01:25:55.832]  Oh, it's hardcore combat every day out there.
[01:25:55.832 --> 01:26:02.553]  And then if a missionary tries to fly in, you know, they shoot down any small aircraft that don't have transponders.
[01:26:02.553 --> 01:26:03.433]  But the U.S.
[01:26:03.433 --> 01:26:08.734]  aircraft take off every few minutes with cocaine on board.
[01:26:08.734 --> 01:26:10.174]  Just, oh, just taking off.
[01:26:10.174 --> 01:26:13.375]  But any other little planes land or take off, oh, gunships come in.
[01:26:13.375 --> 01:26:15.895]  They got mercenaries shooting everybody down.
[01:26:15.895 --> 01:26:20.596]  It's just fighting over that cocaine, fighting over that heroin.
[01:26:21.661 --> 01:26:24.844]  And then police are in the schools telling your children, tattle on your parents.
[01:26:24.844 --> 01:26:25.925]  What's in the medicine cabinet?
[01:26:25.925 --> 01:26:28.407]  Do you ever see them roll a cigarette?
[01:26:28.407 --> 01:26:29.107]  Tell us about it.
[01:26:29.107 --> 01:26:29.428]  You'll get $200.
[01:26:29.428 --> 01:26:33.011]  Yeah, and mommy and daddy will be going to jail.
[01:26:33.011 --> 01:26:44.681]  Yeah, we gotta have secret police and spy and have checkpoints to stop the drugs, while the government openly guards the opium and ships it in and openly runs the cocaine.
[01:26:48.954 --> 01:26:54.577]  Now does that mean there aren't smaller cartels and drug rings and cowboys they gotta kill and hunt down and arrest?
[01:26:54.577 --> 01:26:58.479]  Does that mean they don't like snacks and don't bust little local cocaine dealers?
[01:26:58.479 --> 01:27:04.863]  Who are cutting in on the, uh, cops drug dealing?
[01:27:04.863 --> 01:27:06.604]  Absolutely.
[01:27:06.604 --> 01:27:07.324]  It's a war.
[01:27:07.324 --> 01:27:12.727]  So see, they need to have drugs illegal so they can monopolize it and by making a monopoly it jacks up prices.
[01:27:12.727 --> 01:27:14.328]  It's called business.
[01:27:15.715 --> 01:27:21.079]  And his daddy raised him to be a business man.
[01:27:21.079 --> 01:27:23.721]  Cold, ruthless, powerful, focused.
[01:27:23.721 --> 01:27:30.246]  And then you've got a nation, a world of just jellyfish in denial that face any tyranny, any evil, and they just deny it.
[01:27:30.246 --> 01:27:34.149]  Nope, doesn't exist, because you're scared to face it.
[01:27:34.149 --> 01:27:43.277]  You're concerned with your instant gratification and with protecting yourself for the moment, and so you lose the war.
[01:27:43.277 --> 01:27:43.697]  For liberty.
[01:27:44.531 --> 01:27:48.673]  Because you never take the field because you're so scared of the evil at the back of your mind.
[01:27:48.673 --> 01:27:50.154]  Oh, that's just crazy conspiracy.
[01:27:50.154 --> 01:27:51.534]  Uh, everything's fine.
[01:27:51.534 --> 01:27:53.855]  Uh, because it's your job as a cop.
[01:27:53.855 --> 01:27:54.655]  You're not dealing drugs.
[01:27:54.655 --> 01:27:59.297]  You're out giving tickets and getting cats out of trees or, you know, going to domestic disturbances.
[01:27:59.297 --> 01:28:01.238]  You got a tough job.
[01:28:01.238 --> 01:28:07.181]  I wouldn't want to work for $35,000 a year, hanging my butt out in traffic and stumbling around writing tickets all day and dealing with drunks.
[01:28:10.066 --> 01:28:31.750]  But the point is, don't deny it, don't, I mean, it's been in the Miami Herald, it's been in Esquire Magazine, it's been in Reuters, you know, with a plane lands and the local sheriff's deputies have got a tip and they go grab it and it's a plane full of tons of cocaine and the guys all flash CIA badges and the FBI pulls up and tells the local cops, get out of here, or state police in Texas found an 18-wheeler with three tons of coke.
[01:28:31.750 --> 01:28:36.091]  I'm just giving you a few well-known cases, and the FBI shows up and says, that's ours, thank you.
[01:28:40.635 --> 01:28:41.796]  And they're not going to stop.
[01:28:41.796 --> 01:28:44.819]  And they know that you're waking up to them, so they want a police state.
[01:28:44.819 --> 01:28:45.820]  They want a new world order.
[01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:47.461]  They want to lock down America.
[01:28:47.461 --> 01:28:48.782]  Lock down Europe.
[01:28:48.782 --> 01:28:50.004]  So they can keep doing it.
[01:28:50.004 --> 01:28:50.964]  Think about these bastards.
[01:28:50.964 --> 01:28:53.146]  They don't just get you hooked on drugs.
[01:28:53.146 --> 01:28:54.688]  Illegal and legal.
[01:28:54.688 --> 01:28:56.730]  They push them on you.
[01:28:56.730 --> 01:29:05.958]  And then if they catch you using their product, they throw you in a prison where you work for 20 cents an hour for them also displacing the rest of the public that pays to put you in there.
[01:29:07.708 --> 01:29:11.631]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:11.631 --> 01:29:17.975]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:17.975 --> 01:29:20.977]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:29:20.977 --> 01:29:27.882]  Did you know that those working for world government use the same tactics as Adolf Hitler to gain greater power in America?
[01:29:29.122 --> 01:29:34.343]  Hitler had the Reichstag set on fire as an excuse to declare martial law.
[01:29:34.343 --> 01:29:51.906]  Did you see the Twin Towers in New York go down that led to the Patriot Act, Homeland Security, Public Law 109-364 that eliminates the Posse Comitatus Act and gives George Bush the right to declare martial law for just about any reason?
[01:29:51.906 --> 01:29:55.687]  Is America under siege by high-ranking men in the federal government?
[01:29:56.624 --> 01:30:03.933]  We'd like to help you understand these things by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[01:30:03.933 --> 01:30:05.314]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[01:30:05.314 --> 01:30:05.634]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:30:16.929 --> 01:30:20.652]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[01:30:20.652 --> 01:30:23.074]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[01:30:23.074 --> 01:30:26.537]  Tonight, I have a date with the very lovely Rachel.
[01:30:26.537 --> 01:30:33.562]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[01:30:33.562 --> 01:30:35.724]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[01:30:36.324 --> 01:30:39.686]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[01:30:39.686 --> 01:30:44.569]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[01:30:44.569 --> 01:30:49.472]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[01:30:49.472 --> 01:30:52.073]  Travel less, meet online with Webex.
[01:30:52.073 --> 01:30:55.975]  For as little as $59 a month, about the price of a tank of gas.
[01:30:55.975 --> 01:30:59.217]  You can host unlimited meetings every month from your desktop.
[01:30:59.217 --> 01:31:00.278]  Webex from Cisco.
[01:31:00.578 --> 01:31:00.778]  I think.
[01:31:17.152 --> 01:31:23.920]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:26.563]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:31:26.563 --> 01:31:28.105]  But who is the enemy?
[01:31:28.105 --> 01:31:28.926]  Bin Laden.
[01:31:28.926 --> 01:31:29.766]  This is his MO.
[01:31:29.766 --> 01:31:31.268]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:31:31.268 --> 01:31:32.830]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:31:33.250 --> 01:31:40.415]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:31:40.415 --> 01:31:40.895]  Some U.S.
[01:31:40.895 --> 01:31:47.240]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:50.702]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:31:50.942 --> 01:32:01.227]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:32:01.227 --> 01:32:02.447]  Fabled enemies.

[01:32:09.991 --> 01:32:13.573]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:32:18.024 --> 01:32:24.291]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[01:32:24.291 --> 01:32:25.352]  Listen up, enemies!
[01:32:25.352 --> 01:32:30.877]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[01:32:30.877 --> 01:32:36.383]  We're the Renegades, and it's the time it aids!
[01:32:36.383 --> 01:32:38.025]  And we're the Renegades!
[01:32:38.025 --> 01:32:39.987]  It's the time it aids, we're Renegades!
[01:32:45.385 --> 01:32:47.007]  We're good to go.
[01:33:09.935 --> 01:33:11.136]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:11.136 --> 01:33:16.720]  I want to get into more of what's happening with the Georgia-Russia situation, and you're taking some of your phone calls.
[01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:22.784]  Russian General says Georgia may commit false flag terrorist attacks.
[01:33:22.784 --> 01:33:25.145]  Big news.
[01:33:25.145 --> 01:33:30.589]  Up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:33:30.589 --> 01:33:32.090]  Okay.
[01:33:32.090 --> 01:33:39.055]  I said I would address some stuff only for audiences that even know what I'm talking about, because I'm not going to give attention
[01:33:40.152 --> 01:33:57.616]  Uh, on this international program that, you know, members of the Japanese Parliament listen to, and German defense ministers, former defense ministers, Hollywood folks, people in banking, because we know what's going on, we got our heads screwed on straight, we bring the best guests, this is a very important radio show.
[01:33:57.616 --> 01:34:04.537]  And that is a huge responsibility that I have, and that's why I work so hard.
[01:34:04.537 --> 01:34:08.858]  I am constantly being attacked by the national media, alternative media,
[01:34:10.749 --> 01:34:22.680]  Every lie you can imagine has been invented against me, down to hundreds of videos editing my audio online, with me saying I hate America and things like that.
[01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:34.632]  I mean, it is so legion, the things that are done to me, and it doesn't really bother me because it lets me know we're growing, we're effecting change, we're reaching out to more people.
[01:34:36.275 --> 01:34:37.995]  I know human nature, at least I think I do.
[01:34:37.995 --> 01:34:42.016]  I'm always amazed at just how bad it really is, always works than I thought.
[01:34:42.016 --> 01:34:43.637]  But it's also always better than I thought.
[01:34:43.637 --> 01:34:54.839]  There's also so many great people and wonderful people and so many dedicated people with so much creativity and passion and love and honor.
[01:34:54.839 --> 01:35:01.320]  But, um... I don't gossip on the telephone.
[01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:03.841]  I don't have time to do it.
[01:35:03.841 --> 01:35:05.141]  I mean, I have, frankly,
[01:35:06.064 --> 01:35:09.967]  I'm not even very good at the business of expanding what I'm doing here.
[01:35:09.967 --> 01:35:27.818]  When I have people worth hundreds of millions of dollars that call me up and want to do projects with me, and I'm so busy kind of down in the dirt doing my daily radio show, making films, I'm so focused on the task at hand, I'm so task-oriented that I'm not even good at asking people for money.
[01:35:27.818 --> 01:35:30.260]  They're like, I want to give you a bunch of money, and I'm like, I don't know about
[01:35:30.885 --> 01:35:31.846]  Any strings or anything?
[01:35:31.846 --> 01:35:34.849]  I don't know if I could use that right away or what I'd do with that.
[01:35:34.849 --> 01:35:40.955]  Let me get to the next level and then maybe... And I know that's things that other people would kill for, those type of contacts.
[01:35:40.955 --> 01:35:51.145]  But see, people of substance, people of quality, get an instinct for who the little backstabbing cowardly scum are.
[01:35:51.145 --> 01:35:52.046]  And so they
[01:35:53.169 --> 01:35:59.474]  Don't ever really associate with a lot of the other people in the quote patriot movement who are in this for the wrong reason.
[01:35:59.474 --> 01:36:08.101]  They're in it for personal power, they're in it for grandstanding, they're in it for vanity fair, you know, imagining how big and great they are.
[01:36:08.101 --> 01:36:14.526]  And basically pretty much everybody that I think of that you don't hear on this show.
[01:36:14.526 --> 01:36:15.506]  That'll give you a little tip.
[01:36:15.506 --> 01:36:18.589]  You don't hear somebody on the show that you can get an idea of what I know about them.
[01:36:20.313 --> 01:36:26.518]  They are just totally obsessed with Alex Jones, 24-7.
[01:36:26.518 --> 01:36:32.223]  And I'm always learning of the new evils I've supposedly committed and the new things I've supposedly done.
[01:36:32.223 --> 01:36:45.193]  And after you hear that, and then document it, from eyewitness after eyewitness, you just say, well, why do I let these people suck off of me and use my name and use me to go out and represent themselves as my bosses?
[01:36:45.193 --> 01:36:47.375]  You know, why am I involved in that?
[01:36:47.375 --> 01:36:48.716]  So I say, just get out of my life.
[01:36:48.716 --> 01:36:49.557]  Just get away from me.
[01:36:50.242 --> 01:36:54.266]  Get out of my way, go do what you're gonna do, and just stay away from me!
[01:36:54.266 --> 01:36:58.870]  Leave me alone!
[01:36:58.870 --> 01:37:08.378]  And one of the worst areas in my life, because I can't ignore it completely, I can't avoid it completely, is locals here in Austin, Texas.
[01:37:08.378 --> 01:37:14.604]  And I mean local people, kind of in the little petty hierarchy, and all those that have flooded into Austin and moved into Austin.
[01:37:15.978 --> 01:37:21.903]  I gave red carpet to all of them, and then every time I turned my back, a large knife would be placed squarely between my ribs.
[01:37:21.903 --> 01:37:23.645]  And so I just say, hey, you're ostracized.
[01:37:23.645 --> 01:37:25.066]  I don't want to hear from you.
[01:37:25.066 --> 01:37:26.687]  I don't want to see you.
[01:37:26.687 --> 01:37:28.509]  I don't want to be around you.
[01:37:28.509 --> 01:37:32.932]  I just go, and don't go away mad, just go away.
[01:37:32.932 --> 01:37:35.455]  And they will not do that, folks.
[01:37:35.455 --> 01:37:40.899]  And they want to be in my business, in my life, doing things that you just couldn't believe to me if I told you.
[01:37:40.899 --> 01:37:43.461]  Just unbelievable stuff.
[01:37:43.461 --> 01:37:44.362]  And I ignore it.
[01:37:45.996 --> 01:37:54.179]  And then they invent new things to get people to feel sorry for them, people to quote, come to them and demonize me.
[01:37:54.179 --> 01:37:56.620]  That I always learn about after the fact.
[01:37:56.620 --> 01:38:00.021]  And they demonize other good people, who've been nothing but good to them.
[01:38:00.021 --> 01:38:07.003]  And then even when those individuals come to them and publicly say, well, that's not true, that's not even been discussed, it's like, well, we'll see.
[01:38:07.003 --> 01:38:08.164]  We'll see if that's the truth.
[01:38:08.164 --> 01:38:12.025]  You know, it's just, it's horrible.
[01:38:12.025 --> 01:38:14.746]  I've had people call me up and say, you better do what we say,
[01:38:15.777 --> 01:38:20.241]  You better play ball with us, or we're gonna bring out bad things we know about you.
[01:38:20.241 --> 01:38:21.722]  And I just said, go ahead!
[01:38:21.722 --> 01:38:24.565]  There's nothing bad about me.
[01:38:24.565 --> 01:38:27.667]  What, because you've seen me falling down drunk before?
[01:38:27.667 --> 01:38:31.571]  That was the little blackmail thing, and one other.
[01:38:31.571 --> 01:38:34.633]  You know, I've made no bones about that.
[01:38:34.633 --> 01:38:38.296]  That I don't probably drink eight, nine months out of the year, and sometimes I end up going to a party.
[01:38:38.296 --> 01:38:39.798]  That's why I don't go to parties.
[01:38:39.798 --> 01:38:43.381]  And I end up having four drinks, five drinks, six drinks, seven drinks, ten drinks.
[01:38:45.808 --> 01:39:10.703]  I mean that's the kind of unbelievably wicked stuff that I have seen and I just sit here and I take it and I take it and some other guy goes out and says I'm a drug dealer on the air and says they have witnesses to make it sound real and of course never present them and I have to sue them behind the scenes to make them stop doing it and then they swear they're not going to say anything else about me ever and they do it again and I just turn the other cheek.
[01:39:10.703 --> 01:39:12.264]  I mean this isn't a game folks.
[01:39:12.264 --> 01:39:13.765]  You're not going to stop what I'm doing
[01:39:14.398 --> 01:39:21.683]  And you're not going to stop the people I'm reaching out to, and you're not going to stop the work I'm doing, okay?
[01:39:21.683 --> 01:39:22.644]  It's just not going to happen.
[01:39:22.644 --> 01:39:24.185]  The government's not going to stop me.
[01:39:24.185 --> 01:39:25.786]  The death threats aren't going to stop me.
[01:39:25.786 --> 01:39:27.708]  The audits aren't going to stop me.
[01:39:27.708 --> 01:39:30.570]  None of it is going to stop until somebody kills me.
[01:39:30.570 --> 01:39:32.331]  And there are people talking about that now.
[01:39:32.331 --> 01:39:33.672]  Well, I'm going to beat the hell out of him.
[01:39:33.672 --> 01:39:35.454]  Well, I'm going to come kill you.
[01:39:35.454 --> 01:39:37.335]  And these are people signing their names to it.
[01:39:38.067 --> 01:39:41.209]  Because of made-up lies and crap.
[01:39:41.209 --> 01:39:51.754]  Let me explain something to the local peanut gallery and the local people who want to be the grand poobahs of this movement.
[01:39:51.754 --> 01:39:56.536]  I don't think about you until you crap on my porch, basically.
[01:39:56.536 --> 01:40:03.259]  Until I have to scoop up every week the latest bull you have deposited and just throw it in the trash can.
[01:40:03.259 --> 01:40:07.081]  Hold my nose, throw it in the trash can, feel sorry for you, and move on.
[01:40:10.629 --> 01:40:13.391]  Now, I'm going to tell the locals this, and I mean it.
[01:40:13.391 --> 01:40:16.472]  Any more slander about me, any more crap, I'm going to sue you.
[01:40:16.472 --> 01:40:23.096]  And you're going to lose, because in a court of law, it's going to be shown you're completely full of crap.
[01:40:23.096 --> 01:40:29.519]  I'm not involved in your petty infighting, I'm not involved in your tiny pipe dreams, I'm not involved in your little world.
[01:40:29.519 --> 01:40:31.660]  Do you read me?
[01:40:31.660 --> 01:40:36.963]  I've got rock stars calling me up that I haven't even called back.
[01:40:36.963 --> 01:40:38.984]  Because I'm doing my little thing.
[01:40:38.984 --> 01:40:39.885]  I do my task.
[01:40:40.675 --> 01:40:42.496]  I don't care about it.
[01:40:42.496 --> 01:40:44.016]  I get invited to all sorts of things.
[01:40:44.016 --> 01:40:44.617]  I don't go.
[01:40:44.617 --> 01:40:48.438]  I get invited to address a parliament.
[01:40:48.438 --> 01:40:49.679]  I don't go.
[01:40:49.679 --> 01:40:51.379]  I'm not into myself.
[01:40:51.379 --> 01:40:53.380]  I don't frankly like doing this.
[01:40:53.380 --> 01:40:54.360]  I do it too much.
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:55.461]  I'm sick of it.
[01:40:55.461 --> 01:41:01.623]  And I sure don't care about local people.
[01:41:01.623 --> 01:41:04.504]  Folks, you've seen this a million times.
[01:41:04.504 --> 01:41:08.586]  If somebody's got the hot restaurant in town and the other restaurants down the street are pissed off,
[01:41:09.702 --> 01:41:15.108]  Because they don't have a good chef, they start claiming the other restaurant has cockroaches the size of beagles in it.
[01:41:15.108 --> 01:41:18.030]  And that's sad about me.
[01:41:18.030 --> 01:41:19.732]  And I just, I'm tired of it.
[01:41:19.732 --> 01:41:25.298]  You know, I told John Villarreal at AXS TV that I wasn't going to let him hand it over to Time Warner and shut it down.
[01:41:25.298 --> 01:41:31.644]  And I had to sue them, and I had to have PIs, and I sent him to prison for stealing.
[01:41:31.644 --> 01:41:32.425]  And I had to show him.
[01:41:33.231 --> 01:41:39.214]  And I had to sue three other stalkers over the years, because one of them messed with my sister, the other one came to my house.
[01:41:39.214 --> 01:41:41.535]  I told you, I'm not playing games with them.
[01:41:41.535 --> 01:41:43.075]  They had to be drawn into court.
[01:41:43.075 --> 01:41:47.057]  Believe me, I don't want to spend the time or spend the 20 grand doing it.
[01:41:47.057 --> 01:41:54.400]  I don't care what your delusions are and what your lies are and what your attention-getting crap is.
[01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:58.862]  Any more slander or lies about me, I am going to litigate you into the ground.
[01:41:58.862 --> 01:41:59.342]  Any of you.
[01:42:00.217 --> 01:42:04.461]  You... I understand you eat, drink and sleep Alex Jones, that's all you think about.
[01:42:04.461 --> 01:42:06.182]  Because your head is not in the right spot.
[01:42:06.182 --> 01:42:13.689]  And I understand it's hard for you to understand I'm not part of your life, or part of what you're doing, and I don't care about what you're doing.
[01:42:13.689 --> 01:42:20.795]  But because I'm in Austin, I have to constantly deal with the treachery that is a million feet long.
[01:42:20.795 --> 01:42:24.038]  Now, you've been warned.
[01:42:24.038 --> 01:42:25.659]  You've been warned.
[01:42:25.659 --> 01:42:26.220]  Leave me alone.
[01:42:27.583 --> 01:42:29.264]  Let me do what I'm doing and stay out of my way.
[01:42:29.264 --> 01:42:41.112]  Now, I apologize to stations and affiliates and people, but I know anybody that owns a radio station knows the crap they deal with, and the weirdos, and the weird people, and I know anybody who's in business and life knows about these things.
[01:42:41.112 --> 01:42:43.914]  I will be left alone.
[01:42:43.914 --> 01:42:48.177]  And I will not be drawn into your... I mean, imagine, people need to invent fights with me.
[01:42:48.177 --> 01:42:49.538]  They need to invent their importance.
[01:42:49.538 --> 01:42:51.700]  They need to cry wolf and cry out for help.
[01:42:53.840 --> 01:43:04.722]  So I can find out how I'm attacking people when I don't even know about what they're engaged in or what they're doing other than saying, stop representing yourself as me, stop representing yourself as my radio show.
[01:43:04.722 --> 01:43:05.902]  I can't even do that.
[01:43:05.902 --> 01:43:15.084]  I do that and then all these lies are represented about me because people have to invent crap to sell the gullible public.
[01:43:15.084 --> 01:43:22.325]  The same public last week that I just mentioned on there, I said, that looks like a costume, a suit.
[01:43:23.166 --> 01:43:26.489]  And it came out that the Bigfoot thing is a costume.
[01:43:26.489 --> 01:43:28.411]  You can look at it and tell it's a costume.
[01:43:28.411 --> 01:43:29.752]  I mean, I'm not that smart.
[01:43:29.752 --> 01:43:31.434]  Why can I tell how everything works?
[01:43:31.434 --> 01:43:32.815]  Why do I understand things?
[01:43:32.815 --> 01:43:34.176]  Why do I know human nature?
[01:43:34.176 --> 01:43:36.658]  Why can I predict what people are going to do?
[01:43:36.658 --> 01:43:38.640]  I keep thinking everybody else is like me.
[01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:44.806]  I keep thinking everybody else really loves green fields and blue skies and happiness and camaraderie and friendship and niceness.
[01:43:45.754 --> 01:43:52.595]  But building people up, giving people a hand, helping other people, as I've done, nine times out of ten, they come after you, man.
[01:43:52.595 --> 01:43:54.356]  They try to stab you in the back.
[01:43:54.356 --> 01:43:58.237]  Like, I'm the emperor, and they're throwing me down off the throne.
[01:43:58.237 --> 01:44:00.297]  I am not the emperor of all of this stuff.
[01:44:00.297 --> 01:44:01.917]  Yes, am I the biggest thing in the truth movement?
[01:44:01.917 --> 01:44:03.358]  Am I the biggest 9-11 guy?
[01:44:03.358 --> 01:44:06.238]  Am I the person with the biggest websites, the biggest radio show?
[01:44:06.238 --> 01:44:07.178]  Yes, yes, yes.
[01:44:07.178 --> 01:44:11.339]  You understand what a burden that is.
[01:44:11.339 --> 01:44:13.120]  And I tried to work with everybody.
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:14.340]  I tried to be nice to people.
[01:44:14.340 --> 01:44:14.920]  Red carpet.
[01:44:16.152 --> 01:44:23.959]  And all I got was hatred and duplicity and backstabbing out of it, and then new lies for old.
[01:44:23.959 --> 01:44:29.003]  Now, I don't want... I don't want to get into gossip and attacks and all the rest of the crap.
[01:44:29.003 --> 01:44:30.465]  It will not be discussed on my show.
[01:44:30.465 --> 01:44:34.308]  And people are going to be asking, what the hell is Alex Jones talking about?
[01:44:34.308 --> 01:44:37.311]  That's just what my enemies want, is that attention.
[01:44:37.311 --> 01:44:39.553]  And I'm just going to tell them again.
[01:44:40.377 --> 01:44:45.482]  I am going to defeat you if you mess with me, if you attack me anymore, and then lie and say I'm attacking you.
[01:44:45.482 --> 01:44:46.123]  Classic.
[01:44:46.123 --> 01:44:49.506]  They attack Russia, say Russia attack them.
[01:44:49.506 --> 01:44:54.811]  They attack Serbia, they say Serbia attacked Albania, Kosovo.
[01:44:54.811 --> 01:44:59.376]  I mean, this is what our culture, as above so below, that's what the culture does.
[01:44:59.376 --> 01:45:01.278]  It's a culture of lying and crap.
[01:45:01.278 --> 01:45:02.459]  I'm sorry, I got a great mother.
[01:45:03.314 --> 01:45:29.428]  Just a wonderful, pure-hearted, classy... I thought growing up with people that told you what they thought, and who were good, and loving, and honorable, and who read poetry to me when I was little, and who took me to the symphony, and who took me fishing, and hunting, and loved me, and I didn't know how good my father was, a good, honorable man who I watched people cheat, and steal from, and take his goodness, and turn it against him, and I didn't have any idea that my family
[01:45:30.635 --> 01:45:36.578]  All of them are honorable, good, hard-working, salt-of-the-earth, and I never realized what a treasure I had.
[01:45:36.578 --> 01:45:40.080]  I never realized that most people were scum and trash.
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:49.764]  I never realized how sick and degenerate our society was, and how stupid the public was, people in our own movement, to buy crap and bull.
[01:45:49.764 --> 01:45:54.347]  I never realized just how bad this society is.
[01:45:54.347 --> 01:45:56.748]  But we're people who'll go out and kill our own children,
[01:45:59.628 --> 01:46:02.089]  And then think nothing of it.
[01:46:02.089 --> 01:46:05.529]  Go out, get an abortion, go out to the bar that night.
[01:46:05.529 --> 01:46:07.730]  Hell, get pregnant again, have another abortion.
[01:46:07.730 --> 01:46:11.171]  Men pressuring their girlfriends to have it because they're lazy, because they don't want to get married.
[01:46:11.171 --> 01:46:12.451]  They don't want to have to work an extra job.
[01:46:12.451 --> 01:46:13.951]  They don't want to raise those children.
[01:46:13.951 --> 01:46:17.732]  They want to go around screwing other women instead of being a man.
[01:46:17.732 --> 01:46:25.514]  It's a society of lack of responsibility and a delusional society that lies to themselves and invents whatever they need.
[01:46:26.215 --> 01:46:30.437]  To rationalize the evil and the bull that they're involved in.
[01:46:30.437 --> 01:46:35.179]  I'm gonna tell you one more time.
[01:46:35.179 --> 01:46:36.220]  I got work to do.
[01:46:36.220 --> 01:46:38.181]  I've got issues and things to take care of.
[01:46:38.181 --> 01:46:47.025]  But this flare-up and the boils and the maggots that infest Austin.
[01:46:47.025 --> 01:46:50.967]  That have come streaming into here.
[01:46:50.967 --> 01:46:51.727]  I don't care.
[01:46:51.727 --> 01:46:53.148]  You can run around and do what you want.
[01:46:53.999 --> 01:46:59.143]  Just forget I exist and do not lie about me anymore.
[01:46:59.143 --> 01:47:08.309]  You and your delusional camp followers.
[01:47:08.309 --> 01:47:13.793]  It's like a child keeps running down the street and you go, hey, you're going to get in trouble if you do that one more time.
[01:47:13.793 --> 01:47:14.713]  Don't do that again.
[01:47:14.713 --> 01:47:18.696]  It's the same thing with some bully.
[01:47:18.696 --> 01:47:20.417]  He's got you cornered, shoving you, pushing you.
[01:47:20.417 --> 01:47:21.198]  Come on, punk.
[01:47:21.198 --> 01:47:22.039]  Come on, punk.
[01:47:22.039 --> 01:47:22.599]  Come on, punk.
[01:47:23.396 --> 01:47:25.137]  And you just go, man, I don't want to do this.
[01:47:25.137 --> 01:47:27.458]  I don't want to do this.
[01:47:27.458 --> 01:47:28.819]  I don't want to do this.
[01:47:28.819 --> 01:47:34.403]  That's another situation analogous to this.
[01:47:34.403 --> 01:47:38.745]  I mean, you want to jump the shark?
[01:47:38.745 --> 01:47:41.607]  Just realize you're not successful because of who you are.
[01:47:42.685 --> 01:47:45.167]  You're not successful because your spirit is wrong.
[01:47:45.167 --> 01:47:47.448]  You're not successful because you're in this for the wrong reasons.
[01:47:47.448 --> 01:47:48.769]  And it isn't me.
[01:47:48.769 --> 01:47:56.334]  You can't put all your problems on somebody who doesn't care about you, doesn't think about you, and doesn't give a damn what you're doing.
[01:47:56.334 --> 01:47:57.615]  Just do what you want.
[01:47:57.615 --> 01:47:58.996]  Do it over there.
[01:47:58.996 --> 01:48:03.299]  I'm out of your life.
[01:48:03.299 --> 01:48:08.122]  Okay, some of the other news that I have here in front of me.
[01:48:13.118 --> 01:48:16.740]  Russian General says Georgia, this is what this show is really all about, folks.
[01:48:16.740 --> 01:48:22.502]  Russian General says Georgia may commit false flag terror attacks.
[01:48:22.502 --> 01:48:40.549]  Deputy Chief of the Russian General Staff Antonoli, and I'm going to pronounce this wrong, Nogovishin, warns that Georgia may be planning to commit false flag terror attacks by using mercenaries dressed in Russian uniforms as Russia moved to guard sensitive infrastructure against terrorist attacks.
[01:48:40.549 --> 01:48:41.750]  This is so serious, folks.
[01:48:41.750 --> 01:48:42.710]  This is what we need to be focused on.
[01:48:43.507 --> 01:48:44.947]  The depression that's coming.
[01:48:44.947 --> 01:48:46.928]  World War III that could be forming.
[01:48:46.928 --> 01:48:48.068]  The police state they've set up.
[01:48:48.068 --> 01:48:50.689]  This is life and death!
[01:48:50.689 --> 01:49:05.212]  In a news briefing Monday, he said, I cannot rule out that they might use mercenaries with Slavic appearance for a provocation, clad in the uniform of Russian servicemen, in order to commit subversive acts, both on Ossetian and Russian territory.
[01:49:05.212 --> 01:49:08.273]  In response to the threat, Russia has stationed troops around the
[01:49:11.423 --> 01:49:16.907]  Hydroelectric plant viewed as a potential target in Ingrey.
[01:49:16.907 --> 01:49:21.511]  The General Second Command warned that Georgia may resort to subversion.
[01:49:21.511 --> 01:49:22.792]  Oh, false flags.
[01:49:22.792 --> 01:49:26.214]  Screaming that someone's attacking you when you're really attacking them.
[01:49:26.214 --> 01:49:27.275]  Hmm.
[01:49:27.275 --> 01:49:29.337]  We see that below as well as above, don't we?
[01:49:30.723 --> 01:49:37.425]  He warned that Georgia may resort to subversion in order to enhance its well-groomed image of being the victim.
[01:49:37.425 --> 01:49:38.866]  We see that a lot in life, don't we?
[01:49:38.866 --> 01:49:47.809]  Remember in high school or junior high some girl would ask you out and you wouldn't go out with her and next she would start telling people that you'd grabbed her butt in the parking lot?
[01:49:47.809 --> 01:49:50.010]  Same crap these losers do over and over again.
[01:49:50.934 --> 01:50:03.063]  Warning that Georgia might resort to subversion in order to enhance its well-groomed image of being the victim of a war that it started with the horrific bombardment of civilian targets in South Ossetia.
[01:50:03.063 --> 01:50:05.885]  Oh, we attacked you and now you're standing up to us?
[01:50:05.885 --> 01:50:06.845]  Don't!
[01:50:06.845 --> 01:50:08.686]  Don't be a schmuck!
[01:50:08.686 --> 01:50:10.147]  It's like that in life, isn't it?
[01:50:10.147 --> 01:50:11.548]  Good people have to stand up.
[01:50:13.064 --> 01:50:15.926]  Have you heard about American Free Press?
[01:50:15.926 --> 01:50:17.547]  American Free Press.
[01:50:17.547 --> 01:50:22.049]  The only national newspaper that endorsed Ron Paul for president.
[01:50:22.049 --> 01:50:23.790]  American Free Press.
[01:50:23.790 --> 01:50:26.792]  Written by patriots, for patriots.
[01:50:26.792 --> 01:50:29.554]  Standing firm for our Constitution.
[01:50:29.554 --> 01:50:32.555]  Standing firm against the New World Order.
[01:50:32.555 --> 01:50:34.817]  Hammering the enemies of freedom.
[01:50:34.817 --> 01:50:37.118]  Exposing the intrigues of the global elite.
[01:50:37.919 --> 01:50:45.944]  American Free Press hits the Bilderbergers and Trilateralists, and the whole Council on Foreign Relations gang head-on.
[01:50:45.944 --> 01:50:50.186]  Here's your chance to catch up with the news from American Free Press.

[01:51:07.761 --> 01:51:12.166]  American Free Press, the voice of the Second American Revolution.
[01:51:13.072 --> 01:51:21.679]  Here I am at a gathering of friends, minding my own business, when one of our buddies, Bob, walks up to me, very concerned, and he says, wow, have you seen the gasoline prices lately?
[01:51:21.679 --> 01:51:22.900]  And I said, oh, of course.
[01:51:22.900 --> 01:51:24.141]  Woo, they're high.
[01:51:24.141 --> 01:51:24.641]  He says, yeah.
[01:51:24.641 --> 01:51:25.742]  He says, what am I going to do?
[01:51:25.742 --> 01:51:26.302]  I've got a truck.
[01:51:26.302 --> 01:51:29.225]  There's no way anybody's going to buy my truck in this market.
[01:51:29.225 --> 01:51:31.146]  I really need the truck for my job.
[01:51:31.146 --> 01:51:33.148]  It uses more gas than I can afford.
[01:51:33.148 --> 01:51:35.389]  I've got to find a way to come up with some extra money.
[01:51:35.389 --> 01:51:37.071]  I've got a wife with four kids at home.
[01:51:37.071 --> 01:51:38.171]  I don't know what to do.
[01:51:38.171 --> 01:51:39.212]  I said, Bob, relax.
[01:51:39.212 --> 01:51:39.873]  I know what to do.
[01:51:40.453 --> 01:51:44.757]  Call eFoodsDirect.com or go up on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.

[01:52:03.134 --> 01:52:04.335]  Why don't you do that, Bob?
[01:52:04.335 --> 01:52:05.917]  He said, eFoodsDirect.com?
[01:52:05.917 --> 01:52:07.058]  I said, yep, call them at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:52:07.058 --> 01:52:07.418]  That's 1-800-409-5633.
[01:52:07.418 --> 01:52:08.319]  Do it now.
[01:52:08.319 --> 01:52:10.601]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[01:52:10.601 --> 01:52:14.204]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:52:14.204 --> 01:52:19.429]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:52:19.429 --> 01:52:21.030]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:52:21.030 --> 01:52:22.692]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:52:22.692 --> 01:52:25.594]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:52:25.594 --> 01:52:29.217]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:52:38.867 --> 01:52:43.698]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:52:51.614 --> 01:52:55.057]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:52:55.057 --> 01:52:57.840]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:52:57.840 --> 01:53:03.425]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of that.
[01:53:03.425 --> 01:53:04.406]  Truth Rising.
[01:53:04.406 --> 01:53:07.248]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[01:53:07.248 --> 01:53:09.531]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:53:09.531 --> 01:53:11.993]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:53:23.388 --> 01:53:26.471]  But this story is so big.
[01:53:26.471 --> 01:53:30.855]  I mean, we've got Gary Hart sending a letter to Iran and publishing it in the newspaper.
[01:53:51.135 --> 01:53:51.656]  Saying the U.S.
[01:53:51.656 --> 01:53:55.419]  government will stage terror attacks if you don't submit to them.
[01:53:55.419 --> 01:53:57.781]  Thinking the public's so dumb they can issue open threats.
[01:53:57.781 --> 01:54:03.827]  All the neocons and joint use of staff recordings and rumshell recordings about how great another terror attack would be.
[01:54:03.827 --> 01:54:05.509]  Editorials they write saying that.
[01:54:05.509 --> 01:54:06.529]  This is after 9-11.
[01:54:08.706 --> 01:54:18.272]  Comes out in New Yorker Magazine, top investigative journalist, Sy Hersh saying Cheney planned to attack our ships with Navy SEALs dressed up like Iranians in fake Iranian patrol boats.
[01:54:18.272 --> 01:54:19.653]  That's coming out.
[01:54:19.653 --> 01:54:26.517]  Top Russian general says Georgia may commit false flag attacks in one of the biggest publications in Russia.
[01:54:26.517 --> 01:54:29.579]  And in a press conference, that they have intelligence of this.
[01:54:29.579 --> 01:54:33.001]  See, false flag is now being exposed.
[01:54:33.001 --> 01:54:34.282]  Self-inflicted wounds.
[01:54:36.855 --> 01:54:41.397]  It's now being exposed.
[01:54:41.397 --> 01:54:43.858]  Everywhere.
[01:54:43.858 --> 01:54:46.919]  The top... attacked by Russians.
[01:54:46.919 --> 01:54:49.760]  And now, international news crews have gone in, and it's not true.
[01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:51.861]  It's been proven to be a fraud.
[01:54:51.861 --> 01:54:55.582]  In reality, 70% was destroyed.
[01:54:55.582 --> 01:55:00.964]  Whereas Gorey suffered relatively little damage, according to the United Nations aid convoy.
[01:55:01.758 --> 01:55:09.000]  So, the capital of South Ossetia was almost completely destroyed, 70% is devastating, and Gory suffered relatively little damage.
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:13.642]  The Russians went in and dismantled their military.
[01:55:13.642 --> 01:55:26.105]  Russia's TV channel, Zavita, Zavinsta, which has five camera crews working in the capital of South Ossetia, aired the same footage two days before on Monday, reports Pravda.
[01:55:26.105 --> 01:55:27.946]  Sky News showed its reports
[01:55:29.065 --> 01:55:35.028]  With no sound, whereas the people showed in the Russian report could be heard speaking Russian and Ossetian dialects.
[01:55:35.028 --> 01:55:47.395]  The crying people shown in the report were heard cursing Georgian President Chekhov and for destruction and manslaughter.
[01:55:47.395 --> 01:55:49.937]  So you watch the same video and they're cursing Georgia.
[01:55:49.937 --> 01:55:53.799]  Hey, doesn't matter in America and England, they just play the video and say it's Russians being cursed.
[01:55:54.801 --> 01:55:55.942]  Works quite nicely, doesn't it?
[01:55:55.942 --> 01:55:59.303]  You attack somebody, then make up lies about them and say you've been attacked.
[01:55:59.303 --> 01:56:01.164]  Very nice tactics.
[01:56:01.164 --> 01:56:05.006]  After the controversy came to light yesterday, the Sky News clip was quickly pulled from the YouTube.
[01:56:05.006 --> 01:56:15.631]  In addition, CNN last week showed Georgian forces attacking Russian civilians in the capital of South Ossetia, the provincial capital, but then claimed it showed Russians attacking Georgians in the town of Gori.
[01:56:15.631 --> 01:56:23.335]  I remember Friday, two weeks ago, when this first broke, a week and a half ago, on 888, we were watching CNN going at it, showing Russian missile launchers.
[01:56:24.215 --> 01:56:28.397]  And we figured out by the next day that it was, it was, it was, uh, it was Georgian.
[01:56:28.397 --> 01:56:32.279]  But the point is, is that, I mean, I can't even grasp the level of lies.
[01:56:32.279 --> 01:56:33.440]  It even suckered me!
[01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:42.185]  I mean, it's just so amazing that they are able to do this!
[01:56:42.185 --> 01:56:51.090]  A 12-year-old American girl who was caught up in the brutal assault of Georgia of South Ossetia attempted to tell the truth about who the real aggressors were during a live Fox interview, but she was quickly silenced by the host.
[01:56:51.090 --> 01:56:53.371]  Western media coverage of the conflict has reflected a
[01:56:55.419 --> 01:57:07.364]  Verily pro-Georgian bias since the start of the war, once again proving that the press is not independent, but simply a mouthpiece of the same Anglo-American power structure from whom Georgia is merely another client state, a proxy.
[01:57:07.364 --> 01:57:08.504]  Good job, Paul Watson.
[01:57:08.504 --> 01:57:11.125]  Incredible article on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:57:11.125 --> 01:57:16.848]  Don't forget this Matrix 9-11 tie-in that's up on JonesReport.com right now.
[01:57:16.848 --> 01:57:19.068]  Incredible video still up there.
[01:57:19.068 --> 01:57:20.229]  We'll be right back with your calls.
[01:57:23.863 --> 01:57:26.484]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:57:32.487 --> 01:57:39.130]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:57:39.130 --> 01:57:41.771]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:57:41.771 --> 01:57:43.312]  But who is the enemy?
[01:57:43.312 --> 01:57:44.132]  Bin Laden.
[01:57:44.132 --> 01:57:44.953]  This is his MO.
[01:57:44.953 --> 01:57:46.493]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:57:46.493 --> 01:57:48.074]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:57:48.454 --> 01:57:55.621]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:57:55.621 --> 01:57:56.102]  Some U.S.
[01:57:56.102 --> 01:58:02.448]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:58:02.448 --> 01:58:05.912]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:58:06.152 --> 01:58:16.416]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:58:16.416 --> 01:58:17.656]  Fabled enemies.
[01:58:17.656 --> 01:58:25.399]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles, at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:25.399 --> 01:58:28.780]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:58:35.015 --> 01:58:37.417]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:58:37.417 --> 01:58:46.624]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:46.624 --> 01:58:47.945]  Big Brother.
[01:58:47.945 --> 01:58:49.707]  Mainstream media.
[01:58:49.707 --> 01:58:51.468]  Government cover-ups.
[01:58:51.468 --> 01:58:53.029]  You want answers?
[01:58:53.029 --> 01:58:54.590]  Well, so does he.
[01:58:54.590 --> 01:58:58.774]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:58.774 --> 01:59:02.877]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:59:09.057 --> 01:59:12.358]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:59:12.358 --> 01:59:14.979]  Now into the third hour, fourth hour.
[01:59:14.979 --> 01:59:16.260]  Sidney Sheehan joining us.
[01:59:16.260 --> 01:59:21.582]  Wide open phones in this hour and a bunch of other news, like Joe Biden promises Georgia billions of dollars.
[01:59:21.582 --> 01:59:25.303]  Ambush of French paratroopers kills nine in Kabul.
[01:59:25.303 --> 01:59:27.284]  Credit crunch may take out large U.S.
[01:59:27.284 --> 01:59:27.884]  bank warrants.
[01:59:27.884 --> 01:59:28.965]  IMF chief.
[01:59:28.965 --> 01:59:31.926]  Japan to label goods carbon footprints, officials say.
[01:59:31.926 --> 01:59:34.227]  Arctic ice sheet grows 30% in last year.
[01:59:34.227 --> 01:59:35.447]  But first, we're going to take calls.
[01:59:35.447 --> 01:59:36.607]  Chris in Florida.
[01:59:36.607 --> 01:59:37.928]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:59:39.333 --> 01:59:40.474]  Hi, Alex.
[01:59:40.474 --> 01:59:44.977]  Yesterday you had Burmese and Rowan, and they were talking about the R&B concerts.
[01:59:44.977 --> 01:59:48.019]  I'm sorry, not yesterday, but this... I think it was Friday.
[01:59:48.019 --> 01:59:49.040]  I think last week, yeah.
[01:59:49.040 --> 02:00:06.433]  And I wanted to ask if you'd seen the YouTube video of the Illuminati symbolism that's being worn by the rap artists like Kanye West, Jay-Z, Beyonce, Skull & Bones, Bell Buckle, and Nas, who just came out badmouthing Fox News on the Colbert Report.
[02:00:07.773 --> 02:00:23.803]  Well, look, I'm not involved with the stuff coming up in New York other than letting them show the two films I just produced, Truth Rising and Tabled Enemies, for free to give firefighters and police money.
[02:00:23.803 --> 02:00:28.045]  I'm not going to New York because I can't go to Denver and then leave again my family.
[02:00:28.045 --> 02:00:28.966]  It's got to stop.
[02:00:28.966 --> 02:00:29.986]  I'm working too much.
[02:00:29.986 --> 02:00:31.887]  It's like I work so much I can't get off the treadmill.
[02:00:31.887 --> 02:00:33.969]  It's like I've got to somehow slow down.
[02:00:33.969 --> 02:00:35.529]  But let me just finish here.
[02:00:35.529 --> 02:00:36.290]  The style
[02:00:36.949 --> 02:00:40.531]  For the last three years, there's been skull and crossbones everywhere.
[02:00:40.531 --> 02:00:44.573]  Now, when Arnold wears an authentic Nazi belt buckle, that's different.
[02:00:44.573 --> 02:01:04.242]  Uh, but when, I mean, Burmess has got a couple, his girlfriend, who's up in New York and really messes him, she sent him a few weeks ago a couple of shirts she bought at Target and one of them had a skull on it, and I told Burmess that people are going to think we're the Illuminati, please don't wear that around the office, because the public sees that and thinks that, but you go to Target, you go to these stores, and it's just skull and crossbones everywhere.
[02:01:06.132 --> 02:01:17.139]  Kind of like before that, it was all camouflage for a few years, and they admit that a lot of the fashions are set by, you know, by Madison Avenue, by the architects.
[02:01:17.139 --> 02:01:23.643]  I mean, so that's going on, but to say that... I know there's a lot of videos, people don't have discernment.
[02:01:23.643 --> 02:01:31.028]  I've seen a lot of anti-New World Order videos, where they show all seeing eyes, where they show New World Order stuff and they're identifying it and saying it's bad.
[02:01:32.003 --> 02:01:34.104]  And then people see it.
[02:01:34.104 --> 02:01:38.385]  Oh, who's that big guy who did some 9-11 videos about 9-11 being an inside job?
[02:01:38.385 --> 02:01:38.885]  He's huge.
[02:01:38.885 --> 02:01:43.747]  He's a white rapper from Michigan.
[02:01:43.747 --> 02:01:44.387]  What's his name?
[02:01:44.387 --> 02:01:46.308]  I don't pay attention to it.
[02:01:46.308 --> 02:01:47.828]  Eminem.
[02:01:47.828 --> 02:01:48.389]  Yeah, I know.
[02:01:48.389 --> 02:01:49.229]  I've talked to folks that know him.
[02:01:49.229 --> 02:01:50.509]  He's a fan of this show.
[02:01:50.509 --> 02:01:51.070]  Sorry, Eminem.
[02:01:51.070 --> 02:01:52.570]  I just don't keep track of it.
[02:01:52.570 --> 02:01:55.491]  The point is, people thought he was being New World Order there.
[02:01:55.491 --> 02:01:56.672]  He isn't being New World Order.
[02:01:56.672 --> 02:01:57.912]  I mean, here's another example.
[02:01:59.680 --> 02:02:04.984]  Uh, my films, Police State 2, it's Terrorist Storm and Endgame.
[02:02:04.984 --> 02:02:08.946]  When I'm talking about the New World Order, I show pyramids, I show all-seeing eyes.
[02:02:08.946 --> 02:02:10.327]  I show that as the transitions.
[02:02:10.327 --> 02:02:11.688]  I'm talking about them.
[02:02:11.688 --> 02:02:14.430]  I'm saying, New World Order, and I show you their symbol.
[02:02:14.430 --> 02:02:19.233]  And there's all these websites, oh my God, look, it's programming, it's subliminals.
[02:02:19.233 --> 02:02:24.637]  I mean, you'll have a ten-second clip of an all-seeing eye, that's not subliminal, I'm identifying our enemy's flag.
[02:02:24.637 --> 02:02:24.917]  It's like,
[02:02:26.118 --> 02:02:30.921]  If I show a Nazi flag, it doesn't mean that I am for the Nazis.
[02:02:30.921 --> 02:02:33.842]  I'm identifying their symbol.
[02:02:33.842 --> 02:02:37.784]  This is how humans communicate.
[02:02:37.784 --> 02:02:38.445]  Here's an example.
[02:02:38.445 --> 02:02:44.988]  We're redesigning PrisonPlanet.com, and the great designer, and she makes, you know, Hollywood posters, record covers.
[02:02:44.988 --> 02:02:46.349]  She hates the New World Order.
[02:02:46.349 --> 02:02:48.710]  She's made a bunch of designs for the header for the new Prison Planet.
[02:02:48.710 --> 02:02:49.931]  We're about to have another one in the next two weeks.
[02:02:50.632 --> 02:02:52.273]  People don't like this current design, that's fine.
[02:02:52.273 --> 02:02:53.314]  I mean, some do, some don't.
[02:02:53.314 --> 02:02:55.015]  Point is, we're gonna make it even better.
[02:02:55.015 --> 02:03:00.579]  And, uh, her new thing is, uh, it's the Earth with a rising sun coming up behind it, and I know Obama uses that.
[02:03:01.680 --> 02:03:02.801]  And it looks so good.
[02:03:02.801 --> 02:03:04.183]  That's an archetypal image.
[02:03:04.183 --> 02:03:07.906]  They expropriate these basic geometric shapes and ideas.
[02:03:07.906 --> 02:03:10.588]  It's a prison planet.
[02:03:10.588 --> 02:03:16.273]  But even though it looks good, I may have that sun taken off the back just so people don't sit there and say that.
[02:03:16.273 --> 02:03:17.795]  And I'm going to give you another example.
[02:03:17.795 --> 02:03:18.195]  Stay there.
[02:03:18.195 --> 02:03:20.837]  I'm going to come back and give you another example of this.
[02:03:20.837 --> 02:03:24.020]  So we have to have discernment.
[02:03:24.020 --> 02:03:27.103]  I mean, if there's a hundredth of a frame of an all-seeing eye,
[02:03:28.050 --> 02:03:29.971]  In some TV ad.
[02:03:29.971 --> 02:03:31.553]  I mean, you know it's subliminal.
[02:03:31.553 --> 02:03:32.914]  But they're not doing that in subliminals.
[02:03:32.914 --> 02:03:34.195]  It's out in the open.
[02:03:34.195 --> 02:03:36.876]  So these symbols permeate our society.
[02:03:36.876 --> 02:03:37.457]  We'll be right back.
[02:03:42.384 --> 02:03:44.345]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:03:44.345 --> 02:03:47.966]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:03:47.966 --> 02:03:50.407]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:03:50.407 --> 02:03:53.448]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:03:53.448 --> 02:03:59.190]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:03:59.190 --> 02:04:03.111]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[02:04:03.431 --> 02:04:08.633]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[02:04:08.633 --> 02:04:11.695]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[02:04:42.267 --> 02:04:50.631]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on Earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[02:04:50.971 --> 02:04:56.974]  At HempUSA.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the US and Canada.
[02:04:56.974 --> 02:05:04.078]  At HempUSA.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[02:05:04.078 --> 02:05:07.480]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[02:05:07.480 --> 02:05:09.701]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.
[02:05:09.901 --> 02:05:16.505]  This nutrient-dense food can be stored up to five years when vacuum packed and is priced affordably to be used as a storable food.

[02:05:41.972 --> 02:05:50.879]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[02:05:50.879 --> 02:05:56.043]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[02:05:56.043 --> 02:06:07.172]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[02:06:07.552 --> 02:06:13.339]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons, or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:06:13.339 --> 02:06:19.606]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:06:19.606 --> 02:06:20.647]  What about you?

[02:06:53.363 --> 02:06:54.925]  Well, so does he.
[02:06:54.925 --> 02:06:59.109]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:59.109 --> 02:07:04.654]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:07:04.654 --> 02:07:07.997]  Welcome back now into the third hour, eight minutes, twenty-five seconds.
[02:07:07.997 --> 02:07:10.039]  And, okay, Chris, let me finish up and I'm gonna let you have your piece.
[02:07:12.114 --> 02:07:17.578]  I don't even frankly know who these rap groups are and people other than Paris that's coming, who I think is a great guy.
[02:07:17.578 --> 02:07:20.860]  Let's have a lot of good info.
[02:07:20.860 --> 02:07:23.301]  I'm sorry, I'm just not that hip to New York.
[02:07:23.301 --> 02:07:24.362]  I know Luke's a good guy.
[02:07:24.362 --> 02:07:30.005]  Others trying to get big acts there to raise money for 9-11 first responders and get media attention.
[02:07:30.005 --> 02:07:33.027]  I know they want to get Cynthia McKinney and Sidney Sheehan to go.
[02:07:33.027 --> 02:07:34.008]  I think they are going.
[02:07:34.008 --> 02:07:37.310]  Last time I heard, it's tentative.
[02:07:37.310 --> 02:07:37.630]  And so,
[02:07:39.322 --> 02:07:40.123]  I really don't know what to say.
[02:07:40.123 --> 02:07:47.909]  You're saying some of these people wear skull and bones shirts and skull and crossbones and Illuminati symbolism, but I'll give you an example.
[02:07:47.909 --> 02:07:48.609]  I need to call him.
[02:07:48.609 --> 02:07:51.091]  Last time I mentioned this on air, he was listening.
[02:07:51.091 --> 02:07:52.112]  This producer was listening.
[02:07:52.112 --> 02:07:52.972]  Good friend of mine.
[02:07:52.972 --> 02:07:54.153]  I'm just so busy, I have no life.
[02:07:54.153 --> 02:07:54.734]  All of this work.
[02:07:54.734 --> 02:07:59.637]  I did a couple of interviews yesterday on my own show and video editing and then tried to spend some time with my family and it's insane.
[02:08:03.393 --> 02:08:07.556]  A couple weeks ago, there was all these YouTube videos about Alex Jones and Scanner Darkly.
[02:08:07.556 --> 02:08:12.700]  Illuminati symbolism everywhere.
[02:08:12.700 --> 02:08:17.703]  And, back when I was consulting on that film, I had a limited role consulting.
[02:08:17.703 --> 02:08:19.985]  Tommy Pilotta invited me in, Rick Linklater invited me in.
[02:08:19.985 --> 02:08:26.349]  Had been in another film Tommy had produced with Rick Linklater, Waking Life.
[02:08:26.349 --> 02:08:31.973]  And, you know, you've heard Rick here on the air speak out against the New World Order and secret societies, and he really researches it.
[02:08:34.753 --> 02:09:00.187]  Rick told you, Rick told you before it was in Vanity Fair, six months before, that on the set of another film he was making with Bruce Willis, that Bruce Willis had seen Martial Law and Terror Storm in the trailer with Rick, and had said that, well I'm not going to be a neocon anymore, now I know both parties are controlled, I know that the same people that did 9-11 are the ones that killed Kennedy,
[02:09:01.065 --> 02:09:20.276]  And Rick told you that word for word, and then, I don't know, five, six, I don't remember how many months, eight months, I don't know, it was like half a year later, he's interviewed out in Turks and Caicos with his ex-wife and her new husband, that's how, what a cool guy he is with the family, just wants his mother and his children there, so he doesn't care.
[02:09:20.276 --> 02:09:26.960]  And he's there going, yeah, the same people, you know, that killed Kennedy are the ones that are running the current police state and basically did 9-11.
[02:09:28.214 --> 02:09:32.915]  And remember when Rick said that, everybody went on air, and the Neocon blog said it was a lie?
[02:09:32.915 --> 02:09:34.976]  That, oh no, Bruce Willis didn't say that.
[02:09:34.976 --> 02:09:37.036]  Of course, his agent didn't say it was a lie.
[02:09:37.036 --> 02:09:43.398]  It was just some made-up person that claims they know him from the set, uh, who nobody knows said Bruce Willis lied.
[02:09:43.398 --> 02:09:48.899]  But then Bruce Willis went in Vanity Fair.
[02:09:48.899 --> 02:09:54.320]  You know, I'm not even star chasing for this show, though I should, because it really builds the movement and people pay attention to it.
[02:09:54.320 --> 02:09:55.640]  I can get ahold of Bruce Willis.
[02:09:55.640 --> 02:09:56.961]  I ought to try to get him on.
[02:09:56.961 --> 02:09:57.821]  I think I'm going to do that.
[02:10:00.034 --> 02:10:04.056]  But I almost cringe to do it, because as this show gets bigger, it just freaks everybody out.
[02:10:04.056 --> 02:10:07.558]  You know, in the, quote, movement, who want to be the big shots, then they make up more crap.
[02:10:07.558 --> 02:10:09.099]  No, the goal here is to win.
[02:10:09.099 --> 02:10:11.600]  The goal is to take over the country and restore things.
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:12.480]  To be winners.
[02:10:12.480 --> 02:10:13.861]  To have a winning attitude.
[02:10:13.861 --> 02:10:21.365]  To not be a bunch of weird creeps running around talking trash about each other and backstabbing.
[02:10:21.365 --> 02:10:23.646]  So... I'm gonna go back to you in just a second.
[02:10:23.646 --> 02:10:25.026]  I want to finish this part.
[02:10:25.026 --> 02:10:25.607]  Okay?
[02:10:25.607 --> 02:10:26.027]  Stay there.
[02:10:26.027 --> 02:10:27.027]  I'm gonna go to you in just a minute.
[02:10:27.027 --> 02:10:27.968]  I know I was pausing there.
[02:10:28.832 --> 02:10:29.273]  Take a drink.
[02:10:38.306 --> 02:10:50.394]  We think this is what, in 2014, what cell phone tower hubs that scan and control and track the entire population is what we've gotten from DARPA documents.
[02:10:50.394 --> 02:10:51.614]  What do you think of our research?
[02:10:51.614 --> 02:10:54.516]  And I just said, my God, it's as good as mine or better.
[02:10:54.516 --> 02:10:56.657]  And, you know, what do you think of this artist rendering?
[02:10:56.657 --> 02:10:57.538]  What do you think of this idea?
[02:10:57.538 --> 02:11:00.080]  What do you think of, you know, this type of face scanning system?
[02:11:00.080 --> 02:11:03.382]  Does this look realistic to you of what it'll be in 10 years?
[02:11:03.382 --> 02:11:04.682]  I guess it was like 2005.
[02:11:06.440 --> 02:11:07.301]  You know, nine, ten years.
[02:11:07.301 --> 02:11:09.282]  And I was like, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[02:11:09.282 --> 02:11:11.484]  You know, this is set in Southern California.
[02:11:11.484 --> 02:11:18.969]  And they said, also, we want to show people that it's the New World Order running this and shipping in the drugs to basically control the population.
[02:11:18.969 --> 02:11:20.831]  We want to, that's what Philip K. Dick believed.
[02:11:20.831 --> 02:11:22.332]  It's what, you know, his family believed.
[02:11:22.332 --> 02:11:27.576]  So we want to, you know, show a true rendering of his book, A Scanner Darkly.
[02:11:27.576 --> 02:11:30.018]  But then, you know, add some new items to it.
[02:11:30.018 --> 02:11:31.119]  You know, some new.
[02:11:31.119 --> 02:11:31.859]  And I said, yeah.
[02:11:31.859 --> 02:11:35.142]  And so it's not subliminal when Morton Downey Jr.
[02:11:36.087 --> 02:11:36.788]  Not his name?
[02:11:36.788 --> 02:11:40.153]  I met him a couple times, but one of the guys I didn't really get to know on the set good.
[02:11:40.153 --> 02:11:44.379]  Uh, wearing the, um... He's in the new Tropic Thunder movie.
[02:11:44.379 --> 02:11:45.380]  An Iron Man and all that.
[02:11:45.380 --> 02:11:45.881]  Big actor.
[02:11:45.881 --> 02:11:47.764]  I'm embarrassed I can't remember his name properly.
[02:11:47.764 --> 02:11:49.667]  You know, wearing an all-seeing eye on his shirt.
[02:11:49.667 --> 02:11:50.588]  That's not subliminal.
[02:11:52.580 --> 02:11:54.162]  They're showing you.
[02:11:54.162 --> 02:11:57.125]  When they show an Illuminati eye on the wall, they're showing you.
[02:11:57.125 --> 02:11:58.406]  So it goes two ways.
[02:11:58.406 --> 02:12:03.291]  When I am one of my videos, and I was consulted on that and had a little bit of input on that.
[02:12:03.291 --> 02:12:11.500]  I was taken over to this mock house they had where the druggies live addicted to the substance D and hung out with Keanu Reeves, you know, and looked at the set and was asked what I thought of it and
[02:12:12.119 --> 02:12:19.343]  You know, and it was my fans, who were the cameramen and the set builders and the women on it, who were building the sets.
[02:12:19.343 --> 02:12:38.273]  And I was like a little mini-celebrity out there, and it was really great to get to know Keanu Reeves, and I still know him, and know his assistant, and they get my films, and they're very private folks, that's all I'll say, and they're nice folks, and I got to know Woody Harrelson, still talk to him every once in a while, and I got to know Winona Ryder, boy, she was something else, I'll just leave it at that.
[02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:42.661]  Uh, even more pretty in person, I'll tell you.
[02:12:42.661 --> 02:12:46.023]  And very, uh, forward.
[02:12:46.023 --> 02:12:50.445]  But, uh, you know, I mean, they were nice people.
[02:12:50.445 --> 02:12:55.327]  And they don't like the New World Order.
[02:12:55.327 --> 02:13:08.833]  So what does it mean that Keanu Reeves is in the Matrix 1999 film, and they put, and the Wachowski brothers, you know, I mean, in their third movie, it's all about the Illuminati and the New World Order, and Lucifer the Great Architect, and
[02:13:10.811 --> 02:13:12.711]  Keanu Reeves is like Jesus at the end.
[02:13:12.711 --> 02:13:14.852]  I mean, obviously, the whole thing's a cult.
[02:13:14.852 --> 02:13:16.392]  But did Keanu Reeves know about all this?
[02:13:16.392 --> 02:13:20.893]  I'll tell you this, Keanu Reeves is really smart in person.
[02:13:20.893 --> 02:13:28.255]  He just doesn't trust the public or trust anybody, and he's totally closed-lipped, so they say he's retarded on the news.
[02:13:28.255 --> 02:13:30.636]  And Keanu Reeves doesn't like the New World Order.
[02:13:30.636 --> 02:13:35.477]  And that's why he made that film, because it was anti-New World Order for nothing.
[02:13:35.477 --> 02:13:36.517]  Oh, a little tip!
[02:13:36.517 --> 02:13:40.278]  Yeah, I think it was paid $45,000, and that was just to pay for his assistant.
[02:13:42.179 --> 02:13:42.539]  Basically.
[02:13:42.539 --> 02:13:43.919]  You know, he did that.
[02:13:43.919 --> 02:13:49.721]  They all did that for nothing, because they wanted to expose the New World Order.
[02:13:49.721 --> 02:13:51.681]  And then, they're bad.
[02:13:51.681 --> 02:13:54.482]  They're bad, because they are overtly showing you that.
[02:13:54.482 --> 02:14:00.823]  Just like I'm bad with Terror Storm, saying the New World Order and showing a pyramid with an all-seeing eye.
[02:14:00.823 --> 02:14:04.084]  So, I mean, there has to be some level of discernment.
[02:14:04.084 --> 02:14:10.005]  We show you a power pyramid in one of my videos, segmented with the different elites.
[02:14:10.005 --> 02:14:10.685]  That is not
[02:14:11.886 --> 02:14:13.988]  Subliminal programming.
[02:14:13.988 --> 02:14:14.488]  Okay?
[02:14:14.488 --> 02:14:17.630]  Okay, now I'm gonna shut up at that point, and now let you have the floor.
[02:14:17.630 --> 02:14:19.331]  Go ahead, Chris.
[02:14:19.331 --> 02:14:33.182]  Well, I wouldn't have brought it up if I hadn't been using some discernment, but I, you know, you know more than I do in the area of Illuminati symbolism and geometric symbols and such like that, which I wanted to talk about, and, uh, and the Matrix, um, the new story you have on that.
[02:14:33.182 --> 02:14:39.006]  But, uh, in the YouTube videos, uh, I don't know if you've seen the Kanye West, Jay-Z, and, uh, Nas,
[02:14:39.626 --> 02:14:52.236]  They have lyrics, and they do expressions with their hands that are tied to, you know, like having the, doing the basic Masonic symbol with your hands over your left eye, for example.
[02:14:52.236 --> 02:15:01.083]  But, you know, if you look at some of their lyrics, they're a little bit expressive of their pro-Illuminati stance, especially Jay-Z, but I just can't type that right now.
[02:15:01.083 --> 02:15:02.544]  I didn't transcribe the lyrics.
[02:15:03.144 --> 02:15:12.927]  But what I was really calling out... I know Jay-Z's real big, and I just don't... Yeah, I mean, they're just trying to get people that believe 9-11's an inside job who are prominent to come to the thing.
[02:15:12.927 --> 02:15:18.089]  But I would add, people mimic power.
[02:15:18.089 --> 02:15:19.850]  They mimic whoever's the biggest.
[02:15:19.850 --> 02:15:22.591]  I mean, listen to all the other talk show hosts and every other little Patriot outlet.
[02:15:22.591 --> 02:15:28.293]  It's all InfoWars, InfoWars, InfoWars, the InfoWar, where they mimic all my nomenclature.
[02:15:28.293 --> 02:15:32.394]  So above, so below, you know, is the motto of the world, the model of the New World Order.
[02:15:33.966 --> 02:15:39.789]  And certainly you're going to have these rock stars and people who are waking up and who've been in an evil culture.
[02:15:39.789 --> 02:15:45.591]  And so them fluttering over towards the light and wanting to come out for 9-11 Truth or whatever, does that mean they're perfect?
[02:15:45.591 --> 02:15:47.612]  I mean, I have Jesse Ventura on this show.
[02:15:47.612 --> 02:15:48.533]  And we kind of become friends.
[02:15:48.533 --> 02:15:49.773]  I can call him up to his house if I want.
[02:15:49.773 --> 02:15:50.554]  I don't.
[02:15:50.554 --> 02:15:52.675]  But, you know, we talk for a while and he asks me questions.
[02:15:52.675 --> 02:15:53.595]  I ask him questions, you know.
[02:15:54.378 --> 02:15:57.981]  I don't want to brag, but he asked me for advice and stuff.
[02:15:57.981 --> 02:15:58.762]  He's a really nice guy.
[02:15:58.762 --> 02:16:00.443]  He's getting to know me.
[02:16:00.443 --> 02:16:05.247]  And, you know, I met him almost two years ago and gave him some films that really started him off.
[02:16:05.247 --> 02:16:12.253]  And I don't agree with him on his stance on, you know, a few things on abortion and stuff like that.
[02:16:12.253 --> 02:16:16.556]  But, I mean, it's like we put out our message, but we're nice to people.
[02:16:16.556 --> 02:16:20.099]  Did you see Jesus saying, I won't hang out with a prostitute or a money
[02:16:20.891 --> 02:16:24.652]  You know, changer or a collector or a tax collector.
[02:16:24.652 --> 02:16:28.153]  Or, no, he went and then he changed them, but he did it in a loving way.
[02:16:28.153 --> 02:16:29.753]  And I mean, I'm not perfect, man.
[02:16:29.753 --> 02:16:33.614]  I have been promiscuous in high school and college.
[02:16:33.614 --> 02:16:36.535]  I have never done really hard drugs.
[02:16:36.535 --> 02:16:41.876]  I've tried a few here and there and hated them, but I mean, I've, you know, probably gotten drunk 200 times in my life.
[02:16:41.876 --> 02:16:42.796]  I mean, I'm not a big drinker.
[02:16:42.796 --> 02:16:45.037]  I try to stay away from it because I like it too much.
[02:16:45.037 --> 02:16:46.977]  I smoke cigarettes off and on.
[02:16:50.339 --> 02:16:51.481]  I mean, I've never been perfect.
[02:16:51.481 --> 02:17:02.601]  I was... I mean, I just... We have to be reasonable and try to reach out and grow our numbers and then take them over to our side, not just be judgmental about everybody.
[02:17:02.601 --> 02:17:03.262]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[02:17:03.914 --> 02:17:08.317]  Oh yes, and I wanted to ask whether you're judgmental about these symbols.
[02:17:08.317 --> 02:17:26.148]  I want to point out that these symbols are turned upside down, as you mentioned in the Matrix clip, and a symbol like the star, the Christian cross, the swastika, which the Nazis used the male swastika rather than the female, you know, a combination to masculinize the state.
[02:17:26.148 --> 02:17:29.971]  And of course, you know, the fascists is a demasculinization of the people.
[02:17:29.971 --> 02:17:32.032]  But I wanted to mention, say, that these symbols
[02:17:32.612 --> 02:17:39.760]  Our ancients and the sacred geometry comes from Buddhist monks, Hindus, Tibetan lamas, and yogis.
[02:17:39.760 --> 02:17:42.162]  They're not in league with world domination.
[02:17:42.162 --> 02:17:56.537]  And these symbols are seen in meditation, but the state, in my belief, takes them and these very inspiring and uplifting symbols that you can see in meditation in multitudes, as well as other
[02:17:58.158 --> 02:18:16.332]  Yes, there are archetypal, powerful images of God's sacred geometry that the New World Order, the Devil, mimics and counterfeits.
[02:18:16.332 --> 02:18:20.736]  And so I agree, those symbols in and of themselves are not evil.
[02:18:21.681 --> 02:18:24.844]  They're being used because they're powerful.
[02:18:24.844 --> 02:18:27.908]  And they speak to the subconscious.
[02:18:27.908 --> 02:18:28.588]  Okay?
[02:18:28.588 --> 02:18:29.890]  Do you agree with that?
[02:18:29.890 --> 02:18:33.954]  They intimidate, they menace us by taking the natural order and turning it on its head.
[02:18:33.954 --> 02:18:35.455]  And that's their whole intention.
[02:18:35.455 --> 02:18:39.960]  But if you're aware of it, then you can counteract that yourself.
[02:18:39.960 --> 02:18:40.761]  Anything else you want to add?
[02:18:42.179 --> 02:18:42.759]  Yeah, stay there.
[02:18:42.759 --> 02:18:44.761]  I'm gonna come back to you then, Mike and others.
[02:18:44.761 --> 02:18:48.843]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:18:48.843 --> 02:18:54.727]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:18:54.727 --> 02:18:55.827]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[02:18:55.827 --> 02:18:59.830]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:19:00.530 --> 02:19:14.359]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[02:19:14.359 --> 02:19:19.942]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.

[02:19:44.178 --> 02:19:50.945]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:19:50.945 --> 02:19:53.588]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:19:53.588 --> 02:19:55.149]  But who is the enemy?
[02:19:55.149 --> 02:19:55.950]  Bin Laden.
[02:19:55.950 --> 02:19:56.811]  This is his MO.
[02:19:56.811 --> 02:19:58.312]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:19:58.312 --> 02:19:59.874]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:20:00.274 --> 02:20:07.440]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:20:07.440 --> 02:20:07.921]  Some U.S.
[02:20:07.921 --> 02:20:14.286]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:20:14.286 --> 02:20:17.789]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:20:17.789 --> 02:20:28.277]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:20:28.277 --> 02:20:28.978]  Fabled Enemies.
[02:20:29.458 --> 02:20:37.229]  Get the DVD at Infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:20:37.229 --> 02:20:40.593]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists!
[02:20:44.167 --> 02:20:47.269]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:20:47.269 --> 02:20:52.793]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:20:52.793 --> 02:20:58.497]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:20:58.497 --> 02:20:59.999]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:20:59.999 --> 02:21:08.865]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membrane.
[02:21:08.985 --> 02:21:09.305]  Yes!
[02:21:09.305 --> 02:21:11.147]  Now compare a Calvin Pure Soap.

[02:21:44.059 --> 02:21:50.002]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[02:21:50.002 --> 02:21:54.804]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[02:21:54.804 --> 02:22:00.227]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[02:22:00.227 --> 02:22:03.609]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.

[02:22:27.034 --> 02:22:29.695]  Cannot survive in an alkaline environment?

[02:22:50.151 --> 02:22:52.772]  Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive.
[02:22:52.772 --> 02:22:55.172]  He stood six foot six and weighed 245.
[02:22:55.172 --> 02:22:58.213]  Kind of broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip.
[02:22:58.213 --> 02:23:03.594]  And everybody knew you didn't give no lift to Big John.
[02:23:03.594 --> 02:23:06.354]  Big John!
[02:23:06.354 --> 02:23:09.195]  Big John!
[02:23:09.195 --> 02:23:12.075]  Big Bad John!
[02:23:12.075 --> 02:23:13.116]  Big John!
[02:23:15.254 --> 02:23:17.916]  Nobody seemed to know where John called home.
[02:23:17.916 --> 02:23:20.638]  He just drifted into town and stayed all alone.
[02:23:20.638 --> 02:23:24.941]  Didn't say much, kind of quiet and shy, but he spoke it all.
[02:23:24.941 --> 02:23:29.164]  He just said hi to Big John.
[02:23:29.164 --> 02:23:38.751]  Somebody said he came from New Orleans, where he got in a fight over a Cajun queen and a crashing blow from a huge right hand sent a Louisiana fella to the front.
[02:23:38.751 --> 02:23:40.893]  Alright, going back to Chris, then I'm gonna hurry to the other callers.
[02:23:40.893 --> 02:23:41.313]  Mike and
[02:23:42.435 --> 02:23:46.096]  Rashid, Kevin, Mark, Nate and others.
[02:23:46.096 --> 02:23:50.217]  Okay, go ahead and finish up, Chris.
[02:23:50.217 --> 02:23:53.358]  Well, I would say that these world leaders are insane.
[02:23:53.358 --> 02:24:09.023]  They are mad because they have tried to take some of these sacred symbols that would normally raise one's awareness of their miraculous potential and turning that to show off to try to influence others
[02:24:09.823 --> 02:24:23.973]  Um, rather than seeing the, uh, the priority of introspection and communion with God and love and giving, uh, their way is apparently from their symbolism and their actions, their, uh, like I explained,
[02:24:25.194 --> 02:24:52.951]  Physical expressions are about drawing in from the left hand, which in Chinese medicine, in acupuncture, the energy in most people flows in from the left side, so they're more about taking, whereas the more, I guess what you might say, white magic, or which I don't practice, I would say more of a yogi myself, but the white magic seems to be more of the right hand or giving, where the energy flows from the person.
[02:24:53.691 --> 02:25:03.438]  And these world leaders are mad because they see the need to show off a little bit of their power rather than seeking more.
[02:25:03.438 --> 02:25:10.082]  And using these symbols that would normally uplift, turning them upside down is just so arrogant.
[02:25:10.502 --> 02:25:16.325]  They are not aware of the impact that it has on their own psyche and their attempt to influence others.
[02:25:16.325 --> 02:25:24.709]  They're not aware of how they're being used and they rely on the creation for power rather than love, rather than the creation.
[02:25:24.709 --> 02:25:33.213]  Well, I have just found in life, not getting into all this epithereal, you know, ethereal, all this ethereal stuff, I just love to give.
[02:25:33.951 --> 02:25:55.921]  And then I found with so many people, the whole, not just the elite, but the population is in darkness, and I'm certainly not perfect myself, but I have these, you know, pinnacles in my life and my psyche of very, you know, altruistic, you know, very deep spiritual love and brotherly love, and sisterly love, that, but then you try to give, and they take that as weakness, and then like, and then try to overtake you.
[02:25:55.921 --> 02:25:58.282]  You're like, oh, here, let me give, and they're like, alright, bite your hand off.
[02:25:58.945 --> 02:26:03.226]  Yeah, you know, and it's just like, oh my gosh.
[02:26:03.226 --> 02:26:06.007]  I know what you mean, no good deed goes unpunished.
[02:26:06.007 --> 02:26:15.029]  You know, it's like when you cast pearls before swine, but you know, that's why I think you're so brave is that you take that risk with so many people.
[02:26:15.029 --> 02:26:18.610]  In my opinion, I would call your dharma that you've taken on your sense of duty.
[02:26:19.450 --> 02:26:30.216]  To go after these things that would disrupt your peace so much, and you've taken on the duties of other people, I feel like to a great degree.
[02:26:30.216 --> 02:26:31.837]  That's what Alex means.
[02:26:31.837 --> 02:26:32.877]  It means defender of man.
[02:26:32.877 --> 02:26:32.977]  Wow.
[02:26:32.977 --> 02:26:33.778]  That's always what I wanted to do.
[02:26:42.191 --> 02:26:51.940]  And, uh, I just can't believe, I love seeing other people do well, and I didn't figure out until I was a teenager, most people hate seeing you with a nice car or a nice house.
[02:26:51.940 --> 02:26:55.203]  Most people hated if you got a good looking girlfriend or wife, or husband.
[02:26:55.203 --> 02:26:57.986]  They hated if you got nice children.
[02:26:57.986 --> 02:26:59.868]  I mean, I've had, it's sick.
[02:26:59.868 --> 02:27:03.511]  I've had people come up to me and say, we're jealous that your children are so healthy and look so good.
[02:27:03.511 --> 02:27:05.913]  And then you'll see people actually covetously looking at your children.
[02:27:05.913 --> 02:27:07.715]  I mean, it's, I don't understand it.
[02:27:08.562 --> 02:27:11.204]  Living well is the best revenge, as the French say.
[02:27:11.204 --> 02:27:16.948]  And because you're doing well, they can only blame you, I guess, because of the comparison.
[02:27:16.948 --> 02:27:23.772]  But, you know, the polarity, and the idea in these Eastern cultures and meditation is to raise the kundalini.
[02:27:23.772 --> 02:27:28.756]  I know Joe Rogan mentioned that on your show in a call a couple weeks ago, kind of bad-mouthed it.
[02:27:28.756 --> 02:27:29.676]  He wasn't giving it much thought.
[02:27:29.676 --> 02:27:30.677]  Well, I know this.
[02:27:30.677 --> 02:27:34.800]  Whatever it is, you can certainly get in different areas of your mind, your soul.
[02:27:34.800 --> 02:27:38.062]  And Joe Rogan is a lot less worldly and arrogant than when I first knew him.
[02:27:38.682 --> 02:27:40.303]  Gosh, it's been 10 years.
[02:27:40.303 --> 02:27:43.125]  And I still hung out with him a few, you know, I don't know, 10 times or something.
[02:27:43.125 --> 02:27:43.745]  He's a nice guy.
[02:27:43.745 --> 02:27:44.466]  He's real nice.
[02:27:44.466 --> 02:27:46.247]  But he's still real arrogant.
[02:27:46.247 --> 02:27:48.768]  A lot of, you know, whatever you'd call it.
[02:27:48.768 --> 02:27:51.670]  And now he's not as bad as he used to be.
[02:27:51.670 --> 02:27:54.151]  But a lot of that comes with actually getting power.
[02:27:54.151 --> 02:28:04.838]  A lot of that comes when you finally know a bunch of movie stars and all these women are throwing themselves at you and you're on the international television and have a number one TV show and the number one host of Ultimate Fighting.
[02:28:04.838 --> 02:28:06.839]  You kind of figure out that that's not where it's all at.
[02:28:07.774 --> 02:28:14.121]  See, and then you realize, see, people that haven't gotten real success, they don't realize it's really nothing.
[02:28:14.121 --> 02:28:15.502]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[02:28:15.502 --> 02:28:16.423]  Change is good.
[02:28:16.423 --> 02:28:18.986]  Yeah, yeah, they think it's something they'll never attain.
[02:28:18.986 --> 02:28:20.307]  And that's the one thing I don't like.
[02:28:20.307 --> 02:28:21.789]  It's all the envy, man.
[02:28:21.789 --> 02:28:23.610]  It's just, what are you envious of?
[02:28:23.610 --> 02:28:26.213]  I'm nobody, folks.
[02:28:26.213 --> 02:28:27.655]  Everybody is somebody.
[02:28:27.655 --> 02:28:29.156]  But compared to you, I'm nobody.
[02:28:29.156 --> 02:28:29.717]  It's okay.
[02:28:34.702 --> 02:28:35.662]  We're on the march.
[02:28:35.662 --> 02:28:38.643]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:28:38.643 --> 02:28:44.805]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:28:44.805 --> 02:28:50.507]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[02:28:50.507 --> 02:28:51.847]  And we knew what to do.
[02:28:51.847 --> 02:28:53.828]  Or at least we thought we did.
[02:28:53.828 --> 02:29:00.190]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[02:29:00.874 --> 02:29:09.758]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[02:29:09.758 --> 02:29:16.862]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[02:29:16.862 --> 02:29:20.023]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[02:29:20.023 --> 02:29:25.106]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[02:29:25.786 --> 02:29:28.887]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[02:29:28.887 --> 02:29:34.929]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[02:29:34.929 --> 02:29:37.850]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[02:29:37.850 --> 02:29:42.752]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[02:29:44.116 --> 02:29:47.841]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[02:29:47.841 --> 02:29:50.264]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[02:29:50.264 --> 02:29:53.748]  Tonight, I have a date with the very lovely Rachel.
[02:29:53.748 --> 02:30:00.757]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[02:30:00.757 --> 02:30:02.920]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[02:30:03.520 --> 02:30:06.863]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[02:30:06.863 --> 02:30:11.748]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[02:30:11.748 --> 02:30:16.672]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[02:30:16.672 --> 02:30:19.254]  Travel less, meet online with Webex.
[02:30:19.254 --> 02:30:23.178]  For as little as $59 a month, about the price of a tank of gas.
[02:30:23.178 --> 02:30:26.421]  You can host unlimited meetings every month from your desktop.
[02:30:26.421 --> 02:30:27.462]  Webex from Cisco.
[02:30:27.822 --> 02:30:27.982]  I think.
[02:30:44.248 --> 02:30:45.849]  Wake up, Protestant America!
[02:30:45.849 --> 02:30:49.511]  There is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state.
[02:30:49.511 --> 02:30:55.575]  This confederation of evangelicals, Catholics, and Protestant denominations will form one huge political voting bloc.
[02:30:55.575 --> 02:30:59.638]  Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation.
[02:30:59.638 --> 02:31:04.401]  Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom, liberty of conscience.
[02:31:04.401 --> 02:31:09.064]  History and the Bible prove to them that these two systems, church and state, must be kept separate.
[02:31:09.064 --> 02:31:12.786]  It must be our love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us.
[02:31:13.106 --> 02:31:15.708]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement.
[02:31:15.708 --> 02:31:21.011]  From history, we saw that when church and state united, known as Papal Rome, religious intolerance resulted.
[02:31:21.011 --> 02:31:24.674]  This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation.
[02:31:24.674 --> 02:31:27.476]  America and Papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[02:31:27.476 --> 02:31:30.237]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late!
[02:31:30.237 --> 02:31:32.179]  The prophecies are fast fulfilling.
[02:31:32.179 --> 02:31:33.760]  Jesus is coming soon!
[02:31:33.760 --> 02:31:35.121]  For free materials, call 888-211-1715.
[02:31:35.121 --> 02:31:36.942]  Or write The Bible Says, Box 99, Lenore City, Tennessee, 37771.
[02:31:59.915 --> 02:32:08.120]  Your own personal Jesus.
[02:32:08.120 --> 02:32:10.982]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[02:32:10.982 --> 02:32:13.123]  Someone who cares.
[02:32:13.123 --> 02:32:15.725]  Your own personal Jesus.
[02:32:23.674 --> 02:32:24.554]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[02:32:24.554 --> 02:32:25.335]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[02:32:25.335 --> 02:32:25.915]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[02:32:25.915 --> 02:32:26.575]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[02:32:26.575 --> 02:32:27.195]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[02:32:27.195 --> 02:32:27.876]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[02:32:27.876 --> 02:32:28.516]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[02:32:28.516 --> 02:32:29.276]  Someone to hear your prayers.

[02:32:40.700 --> 02:32:41.881]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[02:32:41.881 --> 02:32:42.641]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[02:32:42.641 --> 02:32:43.281]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[02:32:43.281 --> 02:32:44.021]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[02:32:44.021 --> 02:32:44.682]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[02:32:44.682 --> 02:32:45.362]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[02:32:45.362 --> 02:32:45.962]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[02:32:45.962 --> 02:32:46.562]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[02:32:46.562 --> 02:32:47.423]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[02:32:47.423 --> 02:32:48.563]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[02:32:48.563 --> 02:32:49.303]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[02:32:49.303 --> 02:32:50.063]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[02:32:50.063 --> 02:32:51.084]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[02:32:51.084 --> 02:32:51.364]  Someone to
[02:32:52.185 --> 02:32:53.046]  Well, I've had several times.
[02:32:53.046 --> 02:32:55.088]  I don't have the thumb drive that does 36 hours.
[02:32:55.088 --> 02:32:59.512]  I have little video drives that do like 45 minutes, I think.
[02:32:59.512 --> 02:33:00.353]  I don't have the video.
[02:33:00.353 --> 02:33:02.655]  I probably need that, but I've had cameras taken.
[02:33:02.655 --> 02:33:03.596]  I've had them shut off.
[02:33:03.596 --> 02:33:04.837]  I've had them thrown away.
[02:33:04.837 --> 02:33:06.218]  Just, you name it.
[02:33:06.218 --> 02:33:07.319]  Oh, I'd love to hear these stories.
[02:33:07.319 --> 02:33:08.040]  Where's that being done?
[02:33:09.073 --> 02:33:10.493]  Uh, Tipton County, Tennessee.
[02:33:10.493 --> 02:33:13.674]  I, uh, I got fed up with the corruption when we moved here ten years ago.
[02:33:13.674 --> 02:33:16.514]  I actually ran for office two years ago.
[02:33:16.514 --> 02:33:22.095]  We got the black boxes and at 947 I had 4,282 votes.
[02:33:22.095 --> 02:33:23.856]  Uh, a sizable margin.
[02:33:23.856 --> 02:33:25.296]  I had 79% of the votes so I went to bed.
[02:33:25.296 --> 02:33:28.356]  The next day I woke up and I had less than 3,000 votes.
[02:33:28.356 --> 02:33:29.717]  That's how it works?
[02:33:29.717 --> 02:33:33.517]  And then if you start complaining, the cops around you can go get in your car and leave, boy.
[02:33:33.517 --> 02:33:35.018]  This ain't your town.
[02:33:35.018 --> 02:33:37.018]  We run things here, huh?
[02:33:37.018 --> 02:33:37.678]  Is that what happened?
[02:33:38.450 --> 02:33:41.272]  Oh yeah, I've been charged with four felonies.
[02:33:41.272 --> 02:33:43.674]  They shot and killed my dog, shot at me and my wife.
[02:33:43.674 --> 02:33:45.775]  The buddy of the guy I ran against is the old boy.
[02:33:45.775 --> 02:33:49.838]  Oh listen, they're killing sheriffs and other cops all the time in the South.
[02:33:49.838 --> 02:33:51.239]  That's boss hog world, man.
[02:33:53.080 --> 02:34:03.705]  I went to the grand jury to indict the sheriff's deputy who lied, the guy that shot my dog, obviously, and the assistant DA for giving false information to the grand jury.
[02:34:03.705 --> 02:34:09.507]  The jury foreman, who's always the jury foreman for years, same guy, went out and told the DA what I was doing.
[02:34:09.507 --> 02:34:12.869]  Ten minutes later, they arrested me for four counts of aggravated kidnapping.
[02:34:13.229 --> 02:34:14.030]  I said, really?
[02:34:14.030 --> 02:34:14.991]  Let me see the document.
[02:34:14.991 --> 02:34:35.066]  They didn't have a... They had a blank piece of paper they were calling a warrant with no signature, and then... Oh, listen, I've been at the hospitals when they're snatching people's children for no reason, and they'll swear out a five-year-old document with a totally different name saying it's a three-year-old child when it's a newborn, and it's all just totally fake, lawless crooks!
[02:34:35.066 --> 02:34:36.467]  Right, it gets better.
[02:34:36.467 --> 02:34:39.469]  I was giving my father the stuff I had from a
[02:34:40.731 --> 02:34:43.615]  Grand jury presentment and my, uh, calling my wife.
[02:34:43.615 --> 02:34:50.783]  The deputy said I could call my wife and immediately five of these guys surround me and start saying, stop resisting, stop resisting.
[02:34:50.783 --> 02:34:52.685]  And it escalated the volume.
[02:34:52.685 --> 02:34:54.888]  And then one of them jumped on me and started choking me.
[02:34:54.888 --> 02:34:58.813]  So I'm just standing there and I turned my head to keep from being choked.
[02:35:00.695 --> 02:35:06.583]  Well, don't they know, though, that, see, there's bigger criminals above them that are going to hurt them and their family?
[02:35:06.583 --> 02:35:07.644]  No, see, they don't understand.
[02:35:07.644 --> 02:35:12.850]  They think they can take, take, take and never be paid back, but they're going to be paid back so bad.
[02:35:13.516 --> 02:35:14.797]  They don't understand that though.
[02:35:14.797 --> 02:35:17.480]  These people barely have a high school diploma.
[02:35:17.480 --> 02:35:23.845]  This is a rural community where there's... I had Toyota looking at bringing their truck plant to Covington, Tennessee.
[02:35:23.845 --> 02:35:28.229]  They shut down the operation that they were going to move to Marion, Arkansas because of me.
[02:35:28.229 --> 02:35:33.174]  They were looking at moving to Tipton County, but when I lost the election and they saw that the election was rigged,
[02:35:33.915 --> 02:35:39.118]  They pulled out, and you know, there are no good companies going to move to a corrupt community.
[02:35:39.118 --> 02:35:44.621]  That's why all these little bitty towns have just a few little employers, because they want it that way.
[02:35:44.621 --> 02:35:46.162]  It's total power control.
[02:35:46.162 --> 02:35:52.626]  Oh, listen, I've worked and lived in these towns, and there's always, you know, the kids of the officials get to beat up whoever they want.
[02:35:52.626 --> 02:35:58.429]  They stomp around on these just unbelievable power trips, everyone groveling to them.
[02:35:59.410 --> 02:36:03.815]  And the police just literally swagger and people actually bow to them.
[02:36:03.815 --> 02:36:07.619]  And that's what America is now.
[02:36:07.619 --> 02:36:08.640]  It's going to be like that everywhere.
[02:36:09.485 --> 02:36:16.110]  Well, everybody needs to get involved, but everybody needs to be aware of the consequences, and just like being a Christian, it's not the easy life.
[02:36:16.110 --> 02:36:24.355]  When you stand up and speak out for truth and you shine a light on these issues, people are going to come after you, so be prepared and hide your family well.
[02:36:24.355 --> 02:36:25.816]  Well, people say, where's the corruption?
[02:36:25.816 --> 02:36:29.319]  You go scratch the average town or city, it's just rotten.
[02:36:29.319 --> 02:36:33.061]  There's a new coat of paint on it, but under it, it is rotten flesh, man.
[02:36:33.061 --> 02:36:33.682]  It is just...
[02:36:34.512 --> 02:36:38.055]  Any direction you go in, just crime, thieving, stealing.
[02:36:38.055 --> 02:36:43.540]  And that's why they're building this police state up, because they've sucked it so dry they know it's about to collapse.
[02:36:43.540 --> 02:36:46.182]  And then they want to sit on top of the collapse thing as the king of the hill.
[02:36:47.068 --> 02:36:49.630]  And you mentioned about possibly leaving and where to go.
[02:36:49.630 --> 02:36:51.191]  Well, I've got... I'm not going to leave.
[02:36:51.191 --> 02:36:53.914]  The point is, my instinct is, leave, leave.
[02:36:53.914 --> 02:36:56.176]  I wake up in the morning, leave, get out of here.
[02:36:56.176 --> 02:36:59.538]  My instinct is, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[02:36:59.538 --> 02:37:01.980]  Like Jesse Ventura said, you can't help these people.
[02:37:01.980 --> 02:37:05.023]  He told me on the phone, talking to Minnesota, he said, they don't want my help.
[02:37:05.023 --> 02:37:06.064]  They don't want me to run.
[02:37:06.064 --> 02:37:07.425]  They want to be slaves.
[02:37:07.425 --> 02:37:09.306]  I don't totally agree with that.
[02:37:09.306 --> 02:37:11.809]  But I understand why he's just going to Mexico.
[02:37:11.809 --> 02:37:13.650]  You know, and he's not even saying he's running to Liberty.
[02:37:13.650 --> 02:37:14.951]  He's just saying that you can't help them.
[02:37:14.951 --> 02:37:15.892]  They want to be lied to.
[02:37:16.658 --> 02:37:22.260]  I know of two families that have moved to Bolivia of all places, but I don't know the politics or the culture there, or the economy.
[02:37:22.260 --> 02:37:23.441]  It's horrible.
[02:37:23.441 --> 02:37:34.386]  But they believe it's going to be a safer outcome, but I think we need to stand and take our stand here, and as you're doing, educate as many people as possible, and get people to have a backbone.
[02:37:34.386 --> 02:37:35.566]  Don't be afraid to stand up.
[02:37:35.566 --> 02:37:39.388]  I had 15 witnesses that observed me being attacked in the courtroom.
[02:37:39.890 --> 02:37:48.492]  And not a single person is willing to step up because it's like the lady who wrote the bond for me said, if I say anything, I'll be floating down the river.
[02:37:48.492 --> 02:37:50.153]  Everybody in the town... Oh, are you kidding?
[02:37:50.153 --> 02:37:52.173]  Every few months I hear about them.
[02:37:52.173 --> 02:37:57.254]  Some evil boss hog sheriff will be thrown out and then they just kill the new sheriff.
[02:37:57.254 --> 02:37:58.475]  Oh, that's right.
[02:37:58.475 --> 02:38:02.336]  The last sheriff that was replaced, he's now over security in the school system.
[02:38:02.336 --> 02:38:05.556]  They created a job for him and covered up his crimes.
[02:38:05.556 --> 02:38:07.897]  And the one before him supposedly was
[02:38:08.722 --> 02:38:28.617]  Uh... involved in in some murder and they uh... you know what wasn't charged with this you know slowly moved aside and somebody else comes in and and the whole thing is a cover-up the administration covers for each other still born at work and that latter they know they can get to a certain point on that ladder and they're comfortable and as long as you have people with that mentality
[02:38:30.748 --> 02:38:34.091]  People need to wake up, and people need to stand up, and they need to organize.
[02:38:34.091 --> 02:38:42.657]  It is a nation of yes-men, and nice people tend to let people push them around, and push and push and push, and I've just found it's better not to, uh, not to lay down.
[02:38:42.657 --> 02:38:43.518]  It's better to push back.
[02:38:43.518 --> 02:38:44.559]  Thanks for the call.
[02:38:44.559 --> 02:38:45.499]  I appreciate it.
[02:38:45.499 --> 02:38:52.385]  Now, I'll tell you where I've gotten to in my life is just, you know, recommitting ten times harder against evil.
[02:38:53.860 --> 02:38:59.265]  And, you know, I'm the quote biggest thing in the anti-new world order movement in the world.
[02:38:59.265 --> 02:39:00.366]  Well, what a statement!
[02:39:00.366 --> 02:39:01.206]  What a fact!
[02:39:01.206 --> 02:39:06.771]  What an incontrovertible finding of fact!
[02:39:06.771 --> 02:39:07.832]  But does that mean I'm big?
[02:39:07.832 --> 02:39:08.713]  Does that mean I'm bad?
[02:39:08.713 --> 02:39:09.994]  Does that mean I have a lot of power?
[02:39:09.994 --> 02:39:11.655]  No, the contrary!
[02:39:11.655 --> 02:39:20.323]  You know what it's like to know I'm like a little bitty gunboat going up against a fleet of aircraft carriers and battleships
[02:39:21.798 --> 02:39:33.426]  And there's all these people around me in tin cans, griping and bitching about my patrol boat, and I'm like trying to get them into patrol boats to fight the New World Order, and they're just busy saying I'm the New World Order in my little patrol boat.
[02:39:33.426 --> 02:39:36.087]  With a 50-caliber machine gun and two torpedoes on the side.
[02:39:36.087 --> 02:39:39.129]  I mean, you know, it's amazing.
[02:39:39.129 --> 02:39:43.492]  If we can get the people moving, though, that's a lot bigger than the enemy's formation.
[02:39:43.492 --> 02:39:46.394]  And folks think if they grovel and lay down that that makes them safe.
[02:39:46.394 --> 02:39:49.076]  No, that does the opposite.
[02:39:49.076 --> 02:39:50.617]  That brings whole societies down.
[02:39:50.617 --> 02:39:51.197]  It leads into
[02:39:52.648 --> 02:39:54.751]  Real enslavement.
[02:39:54.751 --> 02:39:55.613]  Okay.
[02:39:55.613 --> 02:39:56.594]  Oh, my call list here.
[02:39:56.594 --> 02:39:57.596]  Kevin in Delaware.
[02:39:57.596 --> 02:39:58.037]  You're on the air.
[02:39:58.982 --> 02:40:01.784]  Hey Alex, hey, don't let those people out there get you down.
[02:40:01.784 --> 02:40:12.930]  You've touched a lot of lives, and you've inspired a lot of people, including me, and you've got a lot of crazy glommers on, and stalkers, and just unbelievable.
[02:40:12.930 --> 02:40:18.053]  And every day I kick myself for people I built up that turned out to be just trash of the earth, but go ahead.
[02:40:18.053 --> 02:40:19.334]  No, don't get down.
[02:40:19.334 --> 02:40:24.197]  I wanted to let you know, I called the FCC back because I was kind of wondering what was going on with the
[02:40:26.201 --> 02:40:28.904]  Oh, saying kill 9-11 drug dealers, kill Mark Dyson?
[02:40:28.904 --> 02:40:30.666]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:40:30.666 --> 02:40:41.718]  And this guy on the phone, he's telling me, well, first he starts out, he says, well, you know, that's not really what this complaint form is for, you know, you're kind of, you're using it wrong.
[02:40:41.718 --> 02:40:45.482]  Yeah, you can't say the poopy word, but you can hire out killings.
[02:40:46.837 --> 02:40:49.598]  Well, I just, you know, kind of asking, well, you know, what's wrong?
[02:40:49.598 --> 02:40:57.002]  I mean, I was reading him the, you know, the exact rules about, uh, you know, how, uh, what made it a legitimate complaint.
[02:40:57.002 --> 02:41:00.744]  And he said, those rules are for you, slave, not for us.
[02:41:00.744 --> 02:41:01.784]  Exactly.
[02:41:01.784 --> 02:41:02.565]  So, what did he say?
[02:41:02.565 --> 02:41:09.648]  He kind of tried a different tactic, and he's, he's saying, uh, well, you know, uh, let me get back to you.
[02:41:09.648 --> 02:41:12.630]  I'm gonna... No, you're telling him you will file the complaint.
[02:41:12.630 --> 02:41:14.610]  See, they're not letting the complaints be filed.
[02:41:14.610 --> 02:41:15.551]  They're, they're breaking the law.
[02:41:16.795 --> 02:41:22.498]  Well, I just wanted to... You go to the affiliate station and you file it with his affiliates at the station.
[02:41:22.498 --> 02:41:23.399]  That's how it's done.
[02:41:23.399 --> 02:41:27.941]  And it goes in the permanent file, and they cannot avoid filing a complaint.
[02:41:27.941 --> 02:41:39.948]  Well, I wanted to kind of just get other listeners, anyone out there who filed something, to let them know that, you know, they can't just expect us to, like, forget about it and be distracted... But did he refuse to take your complaint?
[02:41:39.948 --> 02:41:40.468]  I'm sorry?
[02:41:40.468 --> 02:41:41.729]  Did he refuse to take your complaint?
[02:41:42.791 --> 02:41:51.937]  Well, I mean, I'd already lodged, I was kind of asking about the status of it, and he was kind of saying that, well, you know, it wasn't, that's not what this is for.
[02:41:51.937 --> 02:41:52.437]  Yeah, they never filed it.
[02:41:52.437 --> 02:41:52.937]  Yeah, they never filed it.
[02:41:52.937 --> 02:41:53.478]  Yeah, they never filed it.
[02:41:53.478 --> 02:41:54.158]  Yeah, they never filed it.
[02:41:54.158 --> 02:41:54.698]  Yeah, they never filed it.
[02:41:54.698 --> 02:41:55.719]  Yeah, they never filed it.
[02:41:55.719 --> 02:41:57.360]  Yeah, they never filed it.
[02:41:57.360 --> 02:41:57.940]  Yeah, they never filed it.
[02:41:57.940 --> 02:41:58.521]  Yeah, they never filed it.
[02:41:58.521 --> 02:41:59.061]  Yeah, they never filed it.
[02:41:59.061 --> 02:42:00.682]  Yeah, they never filed it.
[02:42:00.682 --> 02:42:01.323]  Yeah, they never filed it.
[02:42:01.323 --> 02:42:01.843]  Yeah, they never filed it.
[02:42:01.843 --> 02:42:02.423]  Yeah, they never filed it.
[02:42:02.423 --> 02:42:03.144]  Yeah, they never filed it.
[02:42:03.144 --> 02:42:03.664]  Yeah, they never filed it.
[02:42:03.664 --> 02:42:05.165]  Yeah, they never filed it.
[02:42:05.165 --> 02:42:05.665]  Yeah, they never filed it.
[02:42:05.665 --> 02:42:06.306]  Yeah, they never filed it.
[02:42:06.306 --> 02:42:06.966]  Yeah, they never filed it.
[02:42:06.966 --> 02:42:07.606]  Yeah, they never filed it.
[02:42:07.606 --> 02:42:08.227]  Yeah, they never filed it.
[02:42:08.227 --> 02:42:08.767]  Yeah, they never filed it.
[02:42:08.767 --> 02:42:09.388]  Yeah, they never filed it.
[02:42:09.388 --> 02:42:09.968]  Yeah, they never filed it.
[02:42:09.968 --> 02:42:10.048]  Yeah,
[02:42:10.896 --> 02:42:11.256]  I hear you.
[02:42:11.256 --> 02:42:12.257]  Let me tell you how radio works.
[02:42:12.257 --> 02:42:14.399]  I appreciate your call.
[02:42:14.399 --> 02:42:18.782]  You file them with the local radio station and it has to go in their FCC permanent file.
[02:42:18.782 --> 02:42:23.126]  But everything is about the people's ignorance and they play it off.
[02:42:23.126 --> 02:42:25.228]  Everything is about the people's ignorance.
[02:42:25.228 --> 02:42:31.653]  They have to put that complaint in their permanent file at the radio station.
[02:42:31.653 --> 02:42:32.934]  So you file it both places.
[02:42:34.480 --> 02:42:37.781]  It's kind of like, you go in and they say, your child must take vaccines and will be arrested.
[02:42:37.781 --> 02:42:39.461]  And then ask them, why will he be arrested?
[02:42:39.461 --> 02:42:41.081]  Well, because we're going to kick him out and they're going to be truant.
[02:42:41.081 --> 02:42:42.482]  Well, wait a minute, but I don't have to take a shot.
[02:42:42.482 --> 02:42:48.243]  They don't have to take a shot, but then you falsely accuse and then falsely kick my child out.
[02:42:48.243 --> 02:42:49.663]  You're the one committing the crime.
[02:42:49.663 --> 02:42:51.864]  Give me that waiver form out of your desk right now.
[02:42:51.864 --> 02:42:53.644]  And they'll go, you know about that?
[02:42:53.644 --> 02:42:54.784]  Here it is.
[02:42:54.784 --> 02:42:57.845]  See, all criminality, all lies, all fraud.
[02:42:57.845 --> 02:43:00.265]  A nation, see, it's not just the government that lies.
[02:43:00.265 --> 02:43:02.066]  We're a nation of liars.
[02:43:02.066 --> 02:43:02.986]  We've become evil.
[02:43:03.928 --> 02:43:04.828]  We were prosperous.
[02:43:04.828 --> 02:43:05.649]  We were never perfect.
[02:43:05.649 --> 02:43:06.809]  We've always had problems.
[02:43:06.809 --> 02:43:11.711]  But we were prosperous because we had Anglo-Saxon common law and people that would fight.
[02:43:11.711 --> 02:43:12.652]  And now we've lost that.
[02:43:12.652 --> 02:43:16.834]  We have corporate fraud law and a nation that's learned how to lie and be scum.
[02:43:16.834 --> 02:43:20.976]  So we're now just a nation of parasites trying to feed on each other.
[02:43:20.976 --> 02:43:24.217]  God forbid you'd be a productive, smart, intelligent, dynamic person.
[02:43:24.217 --> 02:43:27.899]  The parasites come out of the woodwork.
[02:43:27.899 --> 02:43:29.759]  Okay.
[02:43:29.759 --> 02:43:30.580]  Mark in Georgia.
[02:43:30.580 --> 02:43:31.040]  You're on the air.
[02:43:32.611 --> 02:43:32.991]  Hello!
[02:43:32.991 --> 02:43:35.714]  Hey Mark!
[02:43:35.714 --> 02:43:36.875]  Can you hear me?
[02:43:36.875 --> 02:43:38.076]  I sure can!
[02:43:38.076 --> 02:43:42.499]  Oh God bless you brother as you heard me say before.
[02:43:42.499 --> 02:43:45.301]  You're ever in our prayers and you are an answer to our prayer.
[02:43:45.301 --> 02:43:51.507]  I heard something and I want you to understand I'm preparing to respond to this person in your defense.
[02:43:51.507 --> 02:43:53.108]  You've got a lot more allies
[02:43:54.025 --> 02:43:57.086]  And in the truth... I don't want to get into people's lives and rumors here on the air.
[02:43:57.086 --> 02:44:02.547]  There's nothing to say and I... Look, I'm not going to get into the thousands of slanders out there against you.
[02:44:02.547 --> 02:44:03.927]  That only adds to it.
[02:44:03.927 --> 02:44:04.267]  Okay?
[02:44:04.267 --> 02:44:05.367]  I had to put people on notice.
[02:44:05.367 --> 02:44:06.868]  That's all that was earlier.
[02:44:06.868 --> 02:44:08.528]  So if you want to get into something else, that's fine, sir.
[02:44:08.528 --> 02:44:14.069]  Well, the thing is... My approach to it is that honest people make honest mistakes.
[02:44:14.069 --> 02:44:20.650]  And as I say, as you beloved brother in Christ, please show me where I'm wrong because we're all wrong about something, you know?
[02:44:20.650 --> 02:44:22.891]  And the thing is that this person
[02:44:23.970 --> 02:44:25.271]  I don't know the context.
[02:44:25.271 --> 02:44:27.012]  I don't know your side of it.
[02:44:27.012 --> 02:44:30.815]  What happened recently with... Yeah, listen, sir.
[02:44:30.815 --> 02:44:33.457]  I'm not involved with all that stuff.
[02:44:33.457 --> 02:44:34.298]  Ted Anderson...
[02:44:35.245 --> 02:44:54.329]  Cannot allow other people to take our shows and then represent that they own that show, that they have that show, and then go out and do that while they're... All I said to Ted was, I don't like the fact that I don't want to think about these people and they keep lying about me and doing things to me.
[02:44:54.329 --> 02:44:57.030]  And I said, why are you allowing this to go on?
[02:44:58.047 --> 02:45:00.768]  Someone to hold out that they are us.
[02:45:00.768 --> 02:45:02.109]  And he said, you know, you're right.
[02:45:02.109 --> 02:45:05.111]  I just figured I'd be nice a few years ago and let that happen.
[02:45:05.111 --> 02:45:07.332]  And then he went and did something else with somebody completely different.
[02:45:07.332 --> 02:45:09.013]  And then those people made up lies about him.
[02:45:09.013 --> 02:45:12.534]  Because they couldn't counter him on the right of something he has the right to do.
[02:45:12.534 --> 02:45:15.256]  So things had to be invented.
[02:45:15.256 --> 02:45:15.996]  Okay?
[02:45:15.996 --> 02:45:18.517]  And so that's just basically it.
[02:45:18.517 --> 02:45:20.218]  It's just people want to eat my lunch, man.
[02:45:20.218 --> 02:45:22.419]  They want to come in and take over my office.
[02:45:22.419 --> 02:45:23.600]  They want to be us.
[02:45:23.600 --> 02:45:24.920]  They want to run it all.
[02:45:24.920 --> 02:45:25.661]  That's what they do.
[02:45:27.580 --> 02:45:42.685]  I mean, the last time this other group was fighting with some other group, I was not involved in any way, didn't care, it was internal, other network, them fighting with each other, and the nutcase running that said that I was the one running that!
[02:45:42.685 --> 02:45:47.526]  And I had to take the person to court so they would see that that wasn't true, it wasn't true!
[02:45:47.526 --> 02:45:50.167]  Now the other group that this person accused me of running,
[02:45:51.227 --> 02:45:57.749]  Is all fighting with itself and doing all this stuff, and they've sucked me in to say I'm involved in their fight, and it's not true!
[02:45:57.749 --> 02:46:09.751]  It'd be like if you had two neighbors fighting with each other in the front lawn of their house, and then you walk outside with your kids to go to school, and they say, he's behind it, he did it, and you're like, well, what's going on?
[02:46:09.751 --> 02:46:11.692]  It's craziness!
[02:46:11.692 --> 02:46:15.153]  It's... so I'm like, well, God, all I've done is nice things for you.
[02:46:15.153 --> 02:46:16.353]  I don't want to be associated with you.
[02:46:18.121 --> 02:46:19.422]  A den of vipers!
[02:46:19.422 --> 02:46:23.486]  A den of vipers!
[02:46:23.486 --> 02:46:24.867]  This is my radio show.
[02:46:24.867 --> 02:46:26.628]  I own my radio show.
[02:46:26.628 --> 02:46:27.569]  Okay?
[02:46:27.569 --> 02:46:31.512]  And the platform my radio show on is with Ted Anderson.
[02:46:31.512 --> 02:46:35.356]  And I'm not going to allow people to take my show and hold it out as theirs.
[02:46:35.356 --> 02:46:36.717]  That's for AM and FM affiliates.
[02:46:37.466 --> 02:46:43.435]  Not for other hundreds of internet people putting it out and flapping and slapping their stuff on it.
[02:46:43.435 --> 02:46:48.182]  We were so nice we did that and all it did was breed contempt because that wasn't enough.
[02:46:49.193 --> 02:46:51.074]  Letting people hold themselves out as us.
[02:46:51.074 --> 02:46:53.416]  Letting people, uh, pose as us.
[02:46:53.416 --> 02:46:57.018]  Letting people take our advertisers and do it wasn't enough because it wasn't enough for them.
[02:46:57.018 --> 02:46:58.659]  They're like, we want it all!
[02:46:58.659 --> 02:47:00.060]  Give it to us all!
[02:47:00.060 --> 02:47:01.681]  You didn't make us successful!
[02:47:01.681 --> 02:47:04.884]  You didn't slit your throat and bleed into our mouths!
[02:47:04.884 --> 02:47:05.644]  You're bad!
[02:47:05.644 --> 02:47:12.429]  And we're gonna invent BS about you to attack you because we're trash!
[02:47:12.429 --> 02:47:17.712]  I can bring out, it's unbelievable the crap I put up with and I should have never, the other stuff, it's unbelievable.
[02:47:17.712 --> 02:47:18.773]  And that's what people want.
[02:47:19.358 --> 02:47:24.201]  They want their loser lives empowered by somebody like me that's a real workhorse.
[02:47:24.201 --> 02:47:28.985]  That is not what this show is about.
[02:47:28.985 --> 02:47:30.166]  Good God, you people.
[02:47:30.166 --> 02:47:31.527]  The economy is plunging.
[02:47:31.527 --> 02:47:33.488]  The currency is falling apart.
[02:47:33.488 --> 02:47:34.529]  They're starting wars.
[02:47:34.529 --> 02:47:35.890]  The Russians are saying the U.S.
[02:47:35.890 --> 02:47:39.492]  through Georgia may stage false flag attacks.
[02:47:39.492 --> 02:47:42.274]  Millions of people are brain damaged from mercury in the vaccine.
[02:47:42.274 --> 02:47:47.618]  Sodium fluoride is killing people and injuring and brain damaging people all around us.
[02:47:51.141 --> 02:47:54.224]  And the whole world is diseased.
[02:47:54.224 --> 02:47:58.667]  In other businesses, in other things, everybody's in fighting and going crazy.
[02:47:58.667 --> 02:48:04.692]  And neighbors are fighting, and men and women are fighting, and the society is degenerating.
[02:48:04.692 --> 02:48:08.735]  I come on the radio, and I cover news, and I cover information.
[02:48:08.735 --> 02:48:11.938]  And people can't stand that.
[02:48:11.938 --> 02:48:17.242]  And so, they want to sabotage what I'm doing, and they make stuff up.
[02:48:17.242 --> 02:48:19.604]  And then they force me to stand up against it.
[02:48:20.922 --> 02:48:23.903]  They're delusional.
[02:48:23.903 --> 02:48:25.063]  Okay?
[02:48:25.063 --> 02:48:26.203]  It doesn't matter.
[02:48:26.203 --> 02:48:28.904]  It means nothing.
[02:48:28.904 --> 02:48:35.985]  All these piddly dink fake radio networks and things have the listenership of one tiny YouTube channel.
[02:48:35.985 --> 02:48:44.467]  There's probably 30, 40 YouTube channels that put my show up every day where they put up 10, 15, 20, 30 videos a day, each one getting thousands of views within a day.
[02:48:45.549 --> 02:48:46.330]  That's just YouTube.
[02:48:46.330 --> 02:48:48.631]  I'm on every video channel out there.
[02:48:48.631 --> 02:48:51.893]  We're the number one radio show on the internet on Shoutcast.
[02:48:51.893 --> 02:48:52.493]  Go look at it.
[02:48:52.493 --> 02:48:53.954]  Click Stats on there.
[02:48:53.954 --> 02:48:55.335]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:48:55.335 --> 02:48:57.596]  I don't care what people are doing.
[02:48:57.596 --> 02:48:59.197]  They all move here.
[02:48:59.197 --> 02:49:01.158]  They all get in my business.
[02:49:01.158 --> 02:49:04.200]  They constantly make crap up about me.
[02:49:04.200 --> 02:49:06.742]  They say I'm a drug dealer.
[02:49:06.742 --> 02:49:11.405]  They call up and say, you better do what we say or we're gonna bring out dirt on you.
[02:49:11.405 --> 02:49:13.486]  They engage in every form of wickedness.
[02:49:14.332 --> 02:49:17.234]  Stuff I could go on for hours about?
[02:49:17.234 --> 02:49:20.116]  The only issue is, is that I'm here in Austin.
[02:49:20.116 --> 02:49:22.678]  There's stuff going on ten times worse in other places.
[02:49:22.678 --> 02:49:28.762]  But I don't have to sit here, in the middle of it, with all these nuts.
[02:49:28.762 --> 02:49:30.183]  Okay?
[02:49:30.183 --> 02:49:35.386]  Good God, do I have to move out of this town so all these people can just tear each other apart?
[02:49:35.386 --> 02:49:36.367]  Be right back, stay with me.
[02:49:49.093 --> 02:49:50.234]  Here's a story.
[02:49:50.234 --> 02:49:51.075]  You wash your car.
[02:49:51.075 --> 02:49:52.317]  How long does it last?
[02:49:52.317 --> 02:49:53.078]  Three days?
[02:49:53.078 --> 02:49:53.738]  A week?
[02:49:53.738 --> 02:49:54.659]  Two weeks?
[02:49:54.659 --> 02:50:00.145]  Life Change Tea eliminates chemicals, toxins, and parasites, and much more.
[02:50:00.145 --> 02:50:00.866]  The effect?
[02:50:00.866 --> 02:50:01.847]  You lose weight.
[02:50:01.847 --> 02:50:02.308]  That's right.
[02:50:02.308 --> 02:50:03.249]  You lose weight.
[02:50:03.249 --> 02:50:04.610]  So here's the story.
[02:50:04.610 --> 02:50:05.651]  You wash your car.
[02:50:05.651 --> 02:50:06.773]  It gets dirty again.
[02:50:06.773 --> 02:50:07.874]  You cleanse your body.
[02:50:07.874 --> 02:50:09.896]  Chemicals and toxins come back.
[02:50:09.896 --> 02:50:10.196]  The fix?
[02:50:10.817 --> 02:50:11.998]  Stay on the T!

[02:50:23.264 --> 02:50:23.885]  Or call us.
[02:50:23.885 --> 02:50:24.385]  928-308-0408.
[02:50:24.385 --> 02:50:24.865]  That's 928-308-0408.
[02:50:24.865 --> 02:50:25.726]  Get The Tee.
[02:50:25.726 --> 02:50:28.307]  Restoring America's health, one teabag at a time.
[02:50:44.352 --> 02:50:51.119]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:50:51.119 --> 02:50:53.762]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:50:53.762 --> 02:50:55.324]  But who is the enemy?
[02:50:55.324 --> 02:50:56.105]  Bin Laden.
[02:50:56.105 --> 02:50:56.986]  This is his ammo.
[02:50:56.986 --> 02:50:58.487]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:50:58.487 --> 02:50:59.789]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:51:00.449 --> 02:51:07.615]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:51:07.615 --> 02:51:08.095]  Some U.S.
[02:51:08.095 --> 02:51:14.460]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:51:14.460 --> 02:51:17.903]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:51:18.143 --> 02:51:28.433]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:51:28.433 --> 02:51:29.654]  Fabled enemies.
[02:51:29.654 --> 02:51:37.401]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles, at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:51:37.401 --> 02:51:40.784]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:51:44.329 --> 02:51:47.710]  Alabama state code makes it illegal to drive barefoot.
[02:51:47.710 --> 02:51:51.411]  In Downey, California, it's illegal to wash your car in the street.
[02:51:51.411 --> 02:51:55.492]  In Minnesota, you can be fined for displaying that your vehicle is for sale.
[02:51:55.492 --> 02:52:00.194]  These laws are obviously not made to protect us, but instead to help states profit.
[02:52:00.194 --> 02:52:02.994]  The use of red light cameras is another great example.
[02:52:02.994 --> 02:52:08.156]  They intrude on your privacy, are unconstitutional, and cost you valuable time and money.
[02:52:08.636 --> 02:52:15.278]  SprayYourPlate.com is a spray-on photo blocker that protects against red light cameras, toll cameras, and speed cameras.

[02:52:41.132 --> 02:52:42.813]  Don't give your money to the state.
[02:52:42.813 --> 02:52:54.202]  Spray your plate!
[02:52:54.202 --> 02:52:59.026]  Folks, it always happens in every public school.
[02:53:01.087 --> 02:53:05.709]  The guy that all the girls want, they always make crap up and create fake controversies.
[02:53:05.709 --> 02:53:06.809]  It's what a loser society does.
[02:53:06.809 --> 02:53:07.889]  And that's all people do.
[02:53:07.889 --> 02:53:08.630]  And I'm sick of it, man.
[02:53:25.057 --> 02:53:31.761]  I mean, it's literally like, in a scale, it's like somebody one inch tall running around, and I'm always learning of new ones.
[02:53:31.761 --> 02:53:36.484]  I mean, there's just thousands of groups and websites that are Alex Jones.
[02:53:36.484 --> 02:53:38.045]  They don't fight the New World Order.
[02:53:38.045 --> 02:53:40.807]  They make crap up about Alex Jones.
[02:53:40.807 --> 02:53:42.768]  And I'm tired of this show being about me.
[02:53:42.768 --> 02:53:44.249]  I got stacks of news.
[02:53:44.249 --> 02:53:46.070]  Huge guest I want to bring you.
[02:53:46.070 --> 02:53:47.571]  I want to try to get people going.
[02:53:47.571 --> 02:53:49.152]  I want to fight.
[02:53:49.152 --> 02:53:50.313]  And I guess it's constructive if
[02:53:54.423 --> 02:54:00.648]  You know, to illustrate all of this, so people don't keep falling into the trap, we have people to warn.
[02:54:00.648 --> 02:54:01.809]  We have people to wake up.
[02:54:01.809 --> 02:54:03.310]  We have issues to cover.
[02:54:03.310 --> 02:54:07.074]  We have things we need to do.
[02:54:07.074 --> 02:54:10.056]  And we never take responsibility for what we've done.
[02:54:10.056 --> 02:54:12.218]  You know, I try to do that, and it doesn't mean I always do.
[02:54:13.638 --> 02:54:19.022]  But I've just discovered today about more horrors with locals and fighting with each other and that I'm going to be blamed for that.
[02:54:19.022 --> 02:54:22.945]  And I'm like, you go tell those people that I'm not involved in that.
[02:54:22.945 --> 02:54:25.386]  You tell them what the hell is going on now.
[02:54:25.386 --> 02:54:27.188]  Because I'm always the author of everything.
[02:54:27.188 --> 02:54:28.268]  I'm omnipresent.
[02:54:28.268 --> 02:54:31.191]  I can't balance my checkbook.
[02:54:31.191 --> 02:54:33.932]  I've been doing my taxes the last three months.
[02:54:33.932 --> 02:54:38.376]  I'm always forgetting to pay the power bill and the power's getting turned off at my house.
[02:54:38.376 --> 02:54:40.457]  But my God, I run everything, folks.
[02:54:40.457 --> 02:54:41.538]  I'm a mastermind.
[02:54:45.595 --> 02:54:47.236]  I want you to call Cindy Sheehan in five minutes.
[02:54:47.236 --> 02:54:50.759]  I'm not going to take any more calls at this time because I got a bunch of news I want to get to.
[02:54:50.759 --> 02:54:54.102]  And we've also got solutions that need to be discussed.
[02:54:54.102 --> 02:54:56.544]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're turning the heat up here.
[02:54:57.125 --> 02:54:59.527]  I'm working on a JFK film that will be done early next year.
[02:54:59.527 --> 02:55:00.508]  Cinema Verite.
[02:55:00.508 --> 02:55:01.268]  No voiceover.
[02:55:01.268 --> 02:55:01.969]  Excellent.
[02:55:01.969 --> 02:55:03.850]  It gets into the whole new order system.
[02:55:03.850 --> 02:55:05.211]  Breaking information.
[02:55:05.211 --> 02:55:06.312]  Fabled Enemies I produced.
[02:55:06.312 --> 02:55:08.714]  It was directed by Jason Burmess and I also consulted on it.
[02:55:08.714 --> 02:55:10.896]  Worked on it here with Aaron and Rob.
[02:55:10.896 --> 02:55:11.997]  They did great jobs.
[02:55:11.997 --> 02:55:16.440]  We're really going to be sad that Burmess is going to be leaving us in about two weeks to go back to New York.
[02:55:16.440 --> 02:55:22.105]  He's going to come back down in about six months and we're going to hire more editors then because he's got my top editors and it's kind of a hell of a project.
[02:55:22.105 --> 02:55:24.787]  But he's working with us again on another film.
[02:55:24.787 --> 02:55:25.427]  I love Burmess.
[02:55:25.427 --> 02:55:26.048]  He's a good guy.
[02:55:26.681 --> 02:55:30.785]  And we're going to try to build him up.
[02:55:30.785 --> 02:55:35.609]  I've really been watching him for a long time, and I think I can say he's somebody we can finally trust.
[02:55:35.609 --> 02:55:38.852]  He's just a good guy.
[02:55:38.852 --> 02:55:52.365]  And Burmese's new film, Fabled Enemies, is coming out on September 1st, and it addresses the big kahuna, the Israeli situation in 9-11, the Pakistani tie-in with the British and the Israelis, how they did it, what happened.
[02:55:53.112 --> 02:55:54.912]  Taking a big step for us, as big as we are.
[02:55:54.912 --> 02:55:58.213]  It's easy for some 2-bit site with 100 hits a month to cover this subject.
[02:55:58.213 --> 02:56:01.354]  For us, it's a big deal.
[02:56:01.354 --> 02:56:01.894]  And we're doing it.
[02:56:01.894 --> 02:56:02.774]  We're covering the facts.
[02:56:02.774 --> 02:56:04.834]  We're just going where the truth leads us.
[02:56:04.834 --> 02:56:08.055]  And we'll be attacked from all sides for that.
[02:56:08.055 --> 02:56:09.115]  But it is Fabled Enemies.
[02:56:09.115 --> 02:56:12.956]  I hope you pre-order the DVD at InfoWars.com today.
[02:56:12.956 --> 02:56:14.736]  InfoWars.com today.

[02:56:20.698 --> 02:56:21.598]  It takes about 15 cents.
[02:56:22.834 --> 02:56:31.138]  A day to pay for that and it's $5.95 a month it comes out to you get a yearly membership you get three months free it's like 50 bucks or something.
[02:56:31.138 --> 02:56:45.824]  PrisonPlanet.tv and it helps us pay all the IT bills and for the IT people we've got more wanting to hire and everything we're doing here ladies and gentlemen while we fight off the Lillipollies as they try to tie up the Lillipollies you know the what's the story the little people trying to tie the big guy down and
[02:56:46.610 --> 02:56:48.453]  All their little mindless battles.
[02:56:48.453 --> 02:56:49.975]  That's a good analogy for all of this.
[02:56:49.975 --> 02:56:52.759]  And I'm just like being friendly and they're like, he's plotting against us!
[02:56:52.759 --> 02:56:54.121]  And I was like, I don't care!
[02:56:54.121 --> 02:56:54.342]  It's like...
[02:56:55.238 --> 02:57:00.020]  All these people offer me these YouTube channels that have like tens of thousands of members and that have all this stuff.
[02:57:00.020 --> 02:57:01.621]  And I go, oh no, you're doing much better.
[02:57:01.621 --> 02:57:02.921]  You just keep it for yourself.
[02:57:02.921 --> 02:57:05.142]  See, those are normal people they know who are listening.
[02:57:05.142 --> 02:57:06.923]  I don't even... I want you to be empowered.
[02:57:06.923 --> 02:57:09.064]  I want the power of you to take action.
[02:57:09.064 --> 02:57:11.505]  I want you to be leaders.
[02:57:11.505 --> 02:57:13.866]  I want you... I believe in you.
[02:57:13.866 --> 02:57:15.907]  I know we can defeat the New World Order.
[02:57:15.907 --> 02:57:19.268]  We can do that with one more nail in their coffin with Fabled Enemies.
[02:57:19.268 --> 02:57:21.249]  Get it today at Fabled Enemies.
[02:57:26.716 --> 02:57:29.218]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:57:29.218 --> 02:57:35.043]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:57:35.043 --> 02:57:36.464]  It is a big idea.
[02:57:36.464 --> 02:57:39.267]  A new world order.
[02:57:39.267 --> 02:57:44.171]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:57:44.171 --> 02:57:47.013]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[02:57:47.013 --> 02:57:49.796]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:57:49.796 --> 02:57:52.178]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:57:52.956 --> 02:58:00.291]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:58:03.317 --> 02:58:08.759]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:58:08.759 --> 02:58:12.620]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:58:12.620 --> 02:58:15.181]  Build-a-Bear is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:58:15.181 --> 02:58:16.361]  Most people have no idea.
[02:58:16.361 --> 02:58:17.141]  They're not after money.
[02:58:17.141 --> 02:58:18.402]  They have all the money they need.
[02:58:18.402 --> 02:58:19.382]  They're after power.
[02:58:19.382 --> 02:58:20.542]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[02:58:20.542 --> 02:58:25.304]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[02:58:25.304 --> 02:58:28.925]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:58:28.925 --> 02:58:31.566]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslaving.
[02:58:32.026 --> 02:58:38.631]  Well, we are joined in the next couple of segments by an amazing individual.
[02:58:56.024 --> 02:59:10.308]  Her determination to go and live for months on end, out on the scrub brush, next door to Ward Bush's compound, his fake cowboy set, really became a focal point of a woman they couldn't attack.
[02:59:10.308 --> 02:59:15.289]  She lost her son, who bravely fought in Iraq, and she's Cindy Sheehan.
[02:59:15.289 --> 02:59:18.090]  She has been a great leader to all of us, a great example.
[02:59:18.090 --> 02:59:21.291]  She's also become a 9-11 Truth leader in the last year.
[02:59:22.609 --> 02:59:31.835]  And I know myself, Willie Nelson, Jesse Ventura, others I've talked to behind the scenes about her, just admire her and think of her every day.
[02:59:31.835 --> 02:59:41.922]  And we just appreciate her running against that monster Nancy Pelosi, that deceiver who said that, you know, they would bring justice in the war.
[02:59:43.075 --> 02:59:49.998]  Impeach Bush, and all they've done is protect him, all they've done is fawn after him, and it's just unbelievably evil.
[02:59:49.998 --> 02:59:56.960]  Hundreds of thousands have died in Iraq since they got in almost two years ago.
[02:59:56.960 --> 03:00:05.123]  And if we were to listen to Cindy Sheehan and the other mothers and fathers of these dead troops, close to a million people wouldn't be dead right now.
[03:00:05.123 --> 03:00:09.825]  Cindy Sheehan, thanks for coming on with us, and I'm so glad you're running for the House seat of Nancy Pelosi.
[03:00:11.172 --> 03:00:13.914]  Hi Alex, it's great to be on your show again.
[03:00:13.914 --> 03:00:14.795]  It's great to have you there.
[03:00:14.795 --> 03:00:21.861]  Well, I mean, tell us why you're running, how we can support you, and let's break down what's happening in the current world and your take on it.
[03:00:21.861 --> 03:00:34.191]  Well, I'm running and I've been on your show a couple times I think since I announced, but I'm running because, just like you said, Nancy Pelosi has failed to hold the war criminals,
[03:00:36.434 --> 03:00:41.958]  The criminals against our own constitution are responsible, uh, the Bush regime.
[03:00:41.958 --> 03:00:48.323]  And she has failed to use her power to bring the troops home from Iraq and Afghanistan.
[03:00:48.323 --> 03:00:54.407]  And as a matter of fact, she has appropriated a bill with $163 billion that would fund the occupations through next June.
[03:00:54.407 --> 03:00:55.108]  So I think that
[03:01:03.024 --> 03:01:23.031]  The Democrats and the Republicans are co-equally responsible for what's happening in the world today, from the degradation of the environment, to the collapse of our economy, to the astronomical energy prices, to the destruction of our Constitution.
[03:01:23.031 --> 03:01:30.414]  And we have to realize that, that we have to break away from just blind party loyalty
[03:01:31.235 --> 03:01:41.159]  To if we're ever going to solve these deep, deep, horrible problems that are plaguing our nation and our world right now.
[03:01:41.159 --> 03:01:42.499]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[03:01:42.499 --> 03:01:49.842]  And the last time I had you on was probably six, seven months ago when you were considering if she didn't move to end the war impeachment to run.
[03:01:49.842 --> 03:01:53.063]  But now you're officially in the heat of this battle.
[03:01:53.063 --> 03:01:53.964]  That was a year ago.
[03:01:53.964 --> 03:01:55.664]  That was a year ago, Alex.
[03:01:55.664 --> 03:01:56.605]  I announced July 23rd.
[03:02:00.299 --> 03:02:10.307]  Of last year that I was going to run against her and yeah we are definitely in the right and we've been in San Francisco now for over a year.
[03:02:10.307 --> 03:02:12.249]  We've been consolidating our support.
[03:02:12.249 --> 03:02:16.913]  We just went through an enormous task to collect 10,198 signatures to get me on the ballot.
[03:02:20.057 --> 03:02:24.860]  And now we're ready to rock and roll in this campaign and just be very aggressive.
[03:02:24.860 --> 03:02:29.722]  Well, I'll tell you this, if there's not election fraud, you should win.
[03:02:29.722 --> 03:02:31.203]  What are the polls trending?
[03:02:31.203 --> 03:02:33.064]  What are they showing?
[03:02:33.064 --> 03:02:35.626]  Well, we haven't had any polls done yet.
[03:02:35.626 --> 03:02:48.733]  We haven't been able to afford to do any polls, but we're looking into that now because fortunately with Nancy's performance or non-performance hour of
[03:02:50.465 --> 03:03:02.474]  Our donations have gone up, so we're going to check in the polls, and I already know what's important to the people of San Francisco, and I'm fully 100% behind there.
[03:03:02.474 --> 03:03:15.864]  As to election fraud, that's always, you know, a major issue, but we're going to have hundreds of people out on election day, sitting on polls, a team of lawyers, and election fraud hotlines.
[03:03:16.246 --> 03:03:20.707]  And we're going to do everything that's possible to try and prevent that.
[03:03:20.707 --> 03:03:25.209]  Well, Nancy Pelosi is really starting to run scared right now.
[03:03:25.209 --> 03:03:35.272]  Our guest is Cindy Sheehan, and she is running against the monster that is the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi.
[03:03:35.272 --> 03:03:41.074]  We're going to talk more with her on the other side of this quick break.
[03:03:41.074 --> 03:03:41.854]  Hi there.
[03:03:41.854 --> 03:03:43.535]  I want to talk to you about a dirty word.
[03:03:45.112 --> 03:03:46.213]  I know, I know.
[03:03:46.213 --> 03:03:49.775]  As the makers of drink and mate hangover defense tablets, we hear it every day.
[03:03:49.775 --> 03:03:53.037]  Grown, respectable adults don't get hangovers.
[03:03:53.037 --> 03:04:04.525]  Hangovers are what you got in college when you had about ten too many at the frat house and then rolled out of bed bright and early at the crack of noon the next day.
[03:04:04.525 --> 03:04:05.426]  These days?
[03:04:05.426 --> 03:04:11.850]  Well, sure, sometimes you'll have a couple drinks with dinner and sometimes you'll wake up with a little headache feeling just a bit queasy.
[03:04:11.850 --> 03:04:13.631]  But that's not really a hangover, is it?
[03:04:14.872 --> 03:04:15.532]  I don't think so.
[03:04:46.207 --> 03:04:51.852]  Are you tired of hearing that a cure for cancer is coming but it will be available sometime in the future?
[03:04:51.852 --> 03:04:54.494]  At LaysMedInc, the future is here.
[03:04:54.494 --> 03:04:58.158]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with our patented methodology.
[03:04:58.158 --> 03:05:09.588]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can kill skin cancer and breast tumors of any size and many other types of cancer without adverse side effects at our outpatient facility.
[03:05:09.588 --> 03:05:10.048]  We offer
[03:05:10.228 --> 03:05:13.030]  A real solution using real science.
[03:05:13.030 --> 03:05:17.154]  Our unique approach to cancer treatment is what everyone has been waiting for.
[03:05:17.154 --> 03:05:20.617]  A simple, easy way to eliminate the threat of cancer.
[03:05:20.617 --> 03:05:22.879]  Laser technology at its best.

[03:05:31.125 --> 03:05:33.446]  That's L-A-S-E-M-E-D-I-N-C dot com today!
[03:05:44.301 --> 03:05:51.084]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:05:51.084 --> 03:05:53.725]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:05:53.725 --> 03:05:55.266]  But who is the enemy?
[03:05:55.266 --> 03:05:56.066]  Bin Laden.
[03:05:56.066 --> 03:05:56.947]  This is his ammo.
[03:05:56.947 --> 03:05:58.447]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:05:58.447 --> 03:05:59.988]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:06:00.408 --> 03:06:07.573]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:06:07.573 --> 03:06:08.054]  Some U.S.
[03:06:08.054 --> 03:06:14.418]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:06:14.418 --> 03:06:17.861]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:06:18.161 --> 03:06:26.031]  In Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and warnings.

[03:06:33.800 --> 03:06:37.144]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[03:06:42.330 --> 03:06:48.953]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:06:48.953 --> 03:06:53.196]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:06:53.196 --> 03:06:54.796]  Let's talk Turkey.
[03:06:54.796 --> 03:06:59.659]  Barack Obama is run by the same globalists, same neocons that control George Bush.
[03:06:59.659 --> 03:07:01.660]  He's going to continue all this.
[03:07:01.660 --> 03:07:03.301]  John McCain's going to continue it all.
[03:07:03.301 --> 03:07:05.542]  They're co-guilty as
[03:07:07.864 --> 03:07:14.910]  Sidney Sheehan was just saying, and the Democrats in the House, they voted for the secret warrantless spying on American people.
[03:07:14.910 --> 03:07:22.998]  I got a Washington Post article admitting all the police state upgrades, the federalization, it's all being seamlessly transferred to whoever gets elected.
[03:07:23.891 --> 03:07:27.532]  The military-industrial complex, the bomb makers, want it that way.
[03:07:27.532 --> 03:07:28.952]  It's going to be that way.
[03:07:28.952 --> 03:07:36.554]  You have 80-plus percent of the American people in most polls, some say 75, but that's still the majority, who don't want more wars, who don't want all this to happen.
[03:07:36.554 --> 03:07:37.854]  Now, the U.S.
[03:07:37.854 --> 03:07:40.875]  through Georgia has attacked Russia.
[03:07:40.875 --> 03:07:44.175]  The public's so brainwashed that they're being told Russia started it.
[03:07:44.175 --> 03:07:45.676]  I mean, this is dangerous.
[03:07:45.676 --> 03:07:50.477]  And all these top generals and experts have said this could start World War III, they want to go into Iran.
[03:07:51.357 --> 03:07:52.298]  It's common sense.
[03:07:52.298 --> 03:07:53.259]  It's constitutional.
[03:07:53.259 --> 03:07:54.541]  It's the will of the people.
[03:07:54.541 --> 03:07:55.802]  We need to hold them accountable.
[03:07:55.802 --> 03:07:57.264]  And how do we do that?
[03:07:57.264 --> 03:07:58.325]  Electing.
[03:07:58.325 --> 03:08:05.673]  And that will be a major defeat if we take out these evil Democrats and put real anti-war people like
[03:08:06.554 --> 03:08:07.234]  That's absolutely right.
[03:08:07.234 --> 03:08:08.055]  Like we were saying before,
[03:08:36.429 --> 03:08:48.737]  There's very little difference between John McCain and Barack Obama on many key issues that are really important to this country and the world.
[03:08:48.737 --> 03:08:53.419]  Militarism, of course, Barack Obama wants to increase militarism.
[03:08:53.419 --> 03:09:02.425]  He wouldn't be where he was unless he had sold out to the military-industrial complex and AIPAC, which John McCain also has.
[03:09:03.326 --> 03:09:10.952]  And he wouldn't be where he is if he wasn't a puppet or a tool of the war machine.
[03:09:10.952 --> 03:09:18.858]  So it's so important to elect independent people like me to Congress to hold these people accountable.
[03:09:18.858 --> 03:09:24.463]  I could have walked into many districts in this country and won easily.
[03:09:24.463 --> 03:09:28.506]  I could have beaten a Republican or
[03:09:29.085 --> 03:09:34.029]  A Blue Dog Democrat in many, many districts, and it would have been an easy race.
[03:09:34.029 --> 03:09:36.951]  But this is hitting them where it fundamentally hurts.
[03:09:36.951 --> 03:09:46.377]  Nancy Pelosi, no matter what people say, how she's a right-wing liberal, I mean, I'm sorry, a left-wing liberal or whatever, she's not.
[03:09:46.377 --> 03:09:53.302]  She's also part of the system that suppresses us, oppresses us, and keeps us in these wars.
[03:09:53.302 --> 03:09:57.385]  And attacking them right there is attacking them right in the gut, in the very
[03:09:59.757 --> 03:10:04.839]  You know, I think it is extremely and it's an extremely important election.
[03:10:04.839 --> 03:10:23.368]  And if we take Nancy Pelosi out of her seat, that means that there's going to be 534 members of Congress that know that the American public means business and that we want a true change in direction, not just empty rhetoric, but a true change in course.
[03:10:23.368 --> 03:10:28.270]  And I think this will be very, very significant and a very historical
[03:10:29.142 --> 03:10:29.903]  I don't know.
[03:10:41.716 --> 03:10:44.657]  Of peace, accountability, and economic equality.
[03:10:44.657 --> 03:10:46.258]  Well, I'll say this, Cindy.
[03:10:46.258 --> 03:10:49.519]  I've come from, quote, the right, but I don't believe in the left-right paradigm anymore.
[03:10:49.519 --> 03:10:51.799]  No, I don't either.
[03:10:51.799 --> 03:11:07.585]  Exactly, but growing up, but I have to say, Democrats wouldn't wake up to some of Bill Clinton's corruption and attack on Serbia, but Republicans have really shown themselves to be slavish to George Bush and all of his evil that isn't even conservative in the classical sense, but just fascist.
[03:11:08.505 --> 03:11:35.247]  Now, I have to say, I'm really glad to see a lot of people, quote, on the traditional left, really shattering their paradigm, and really getting it, and getting a lot of courage, and understanding the anti-war movements infiltrated, which has come out by military intelligence and others to neutralize it, and foundation money, who realize, and are saying, yeah, a lot of terror is provocative terror, government-sponsored, and I'm seeing a lot of real courage by what you'd call the traditional left right now.
[03:11:35.247 --> 03:11:35.968]  Can you speak to that?
[03:11:37.807 --> 03:11:38.628]  Well, you know, the, uh...
[03:11:42.307 --> 03:11:45.349]  I'm not exactly sure what you're talking about.
[03:11:45.349 --> 03:11:56.318]  Well I understand some folks just got in your car and what I'm saying is I'm seeing more resistance to this and it being non-partisan from people I see on the left.
[03:11:56.318 --> 03:11:59.140]  The biggest awakening I'm seeing is on the left.
[03:11:59.140 --> 03:12:04.404]  They're not being taken for a ride by the Democratic Party for year after year being lied to.
[03:12:04.404 --> 03:12:08.167]  They're not as gullible to their own party as Republicans are.
[03:12:09.318 --> 03:12:11.240]  I'm seeing a little shift in that.
[03:12:11.240 --> 03:12:35.820]  When I first announced last summer that I was leaving the Democratic Party, and then I announced I was running against Nancy Pelosi as an independent, there was, you know, I got so smeared and attacked so badly by the so-called left that I see that they feel the same sense of betrayal by this two-party system that many of us haven't seen for quite a long time.
[03:12:36.678 --> 03:12:49.322]  It's just because of things like Nancy Pelosi giving immunity to telecoms and giving George Bush the power to spy on us without warrants.
[03:12:49.322 --> 03:12:56.004]  They see that Nancy Pelosi was briefed on torture in 2002 and she didn't do anything about it.
[03:12:56.004 --> 03:13:02.346]  And I see that the Democratic Congress has the lowest approval rating of any Congress in history.
[03:13:02.346 --> 03:13:04.627]  It has passed the fewest amount of bills
[03:13:05.530 --> 03:13:06.051]  I don't
[03:13:19.562 --> 03:13:21.864]  And to not hold George Bush and Dick Cheney accountable.
[03:13:21.864 --> 03:13:23.385]  So people are starting to wake up.
[03:13:38.115 --> 03:13:55.300]  You know, a patriot is a scarce thing, hated and feared and scorned, but in time, when their cause succeeds, or when the proof is in the pudding, that Tim would join him, because then it costs nothing to be a patriot like Cindy Sheehan, and now we're a year plus into seeing everything you said being validated, validated, validated.
[03:13:55.300 --> 03:13:56.480]  You're just ahead of the curve.
[03:13:56.480 --> 03:13:58.641]  I'm ahead of the curve, and that's what I'm saying.
[03:13:58.641 --> 03:13:59.241]  I'm not saying
[03:13:59.861 --> 03:14:08.505]  I mean, I'll be honest with you, Cindy, I'm seeing liberals, I mean, even former Congressman Dan Bird come on here and say, you know, he believes in the Second Amendment now because he understands government's tyrannical.
[03:14:08.505 --> 03:14:18.850]  I'm just seeing the paradigm smash, particularly with the left, and really intellectually getting it, and really, I don't know, I'm just impressed with it.
[03:14:18.850 --> 03:14:23.472]  I mean, are there still throngs of Barack Obama zombies and Pelosi zombies?
[03:14:23.472 --> 03:14:23.692]  Sure!
[03:14:24.312 --> 03:14:31.638]  I'm just saying, I have to give credit where it's due, and I have to say that the left is really impressing me, that's all I'm saying.
[03:14:31.638 --> 03:14:52.596]  Well, I think that, I do see that, and I agree with you, and I don't feel as lonely as I did a year ago, but then again, when I first started speaking out that this war was illegal and immoral, and George Bush was a liar, and George Bush was a murderer, and George Bush was a terrorist, you know, I felt lonely then, but most of the country eventually caught up with
[03:14:53.410 --> 03:15:02.381]  So I think that, you know, it takes somebody like me who, I don't say I have courage, but I don't really have a whole lot left to lose.
[03:15:02.381 --> 03:15:10.270]  And I can go out front, and I can take the smears, I can take the attacks, because I've buried my friends.
[03:15:10.905 --> 03:15:18.771]  And if they think that there's anything that the left or the right or the middle or anybody can do to me that's worse than that, that's not going to happen.
[03:15:18.771 --> 03:15:20.473]  What did Janis Joplin say?
[03:15:20.473 --> 03:15:23.695]  Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose?
[03:15:23.695 --> 03:15:26.478]  Nothing left to lose, absolutely.
[03:15:26.478 --> 03:15:39.869]  And I think with the attacks on our Constitution, with the attacks on our rule of law, with the attacks, like you said, it's becoming a fascist police state, and most people don't even realize how close we are to
[03:15:44.478 --> 03:15:58.008]  Yeah, it's time to get past the partisan bull where you put a Republican hat on so you can't talk to anybody else outside that or ever think, or you put a Democrat hat on and then you can't talk to anybody or think.
[03:15:58.008 --> 03:16:03.692]  We've got to end that, you know, not talking, not debating, not being involved.
[03:16:03.692 --> 03:16:08.555]  Well, and I think also you said that the left has started to awaken to that fact and
[03:16:09.529 --> 03:16:14.671]  I believe that just because someone has a D after their name that they must be good because we know that's not true.
[03:16:14.671 --> 03:16:24.395]  We know that Bill Clinton was responsible for killing right now maybe as many of the Iraqis as George Bush has.
[03:16:24.395 --> 03:16:35.340]  That he and his policies were just continuing the fascist police state from the Reagan administration and the George Bush administration.
[03:16:35.922 --> 03:16:38.424]  So, you know, that it is nonpartisan.
[03:16:38.424 --> 03:16:42.066]  I mean, it's a nonpartisan, fascist control of our government.
[03:16:42.066 --> 03:16:47.010]  So we have to join together in a nonpartisan way to challenge them.
[03:16:47.010 --> 03:16:49.731]  And it's also people on the right.
[03:16:49.731 --> 03:17:00.899]  And Ron Paul was able to energize a whole, you know, an entire generation of young people who are willing now to stand up for our Constitution and stand up for the rule of law.
[03:17:00.899 --> 03:17:05.062]  And, you know, I don't agree with every policy of Ron Paul, but
[03:17:05.387 --> 03:17:13.571]  There's many places we interconnect, being anti-war, anti-imperialism, and anti-police state fascism.
[03:17:13.571 --> 03:17:14.632]  We have to work together.
[03:17:14.632 --> 03:17:16.233]  We have to overlook our differences.
[03:17:17.499 --> 03:17:23.085]  Um, to confront this because there's so few of them and there's so many of us.
[03:17:23.085 --> 03:17:23.545]  Yes.
[03:17:23.545 --> 03:17:25.307]  And we have to reclaim our power.
[03:17:25.307 --> 03:17:25.827]  Yes.
[03:17:25.827 --> 03:17:28.450]  Uh, Cindy, we're going to come back in a final segment with you.
[03:17:28.450 --> 03:17:29.431]  Maybe it'll be a little bit longer.
[03:17:29.431 --> 03:17:32.754]  I know you said we could have more time, but I know you're in your car and you need to get into a meeting.
[03:17:32.754 --> 03:17:37.619]  But before we go to break in one minute, fire out the website, the phone number, volunteers, money.
[03:17:37.619 --> 03:17:41.483]  People want to help you bring down Nancy Pelosi and hopefully bring this war to an end.
[03:17:43.114 --> 03:17:45.236]  Cindy4Congress.org.
[03:17:45.236 --> 03:17:49.180]  Cindy, F-O-R, Congress, dot org.
[03:17:49.180 --> 03:17:55.006]  All the contact information, our address, our phone number is on the website.
[03:17:55.006 --> 03:17:56.587]  And people can give nationwide?
[03:17:56.587 --> 03:17:57.168]  They can give nationwide?
[03:17:57.168 --> 03:17:58.449]  They can give nationwide.
[03:17:58.449 --> 03:18:07.698]  We've been able to raise almost $400,000 now, and it's come from donations from $5 all the way up to the maximum donation from just people.
[03:18:08.072 --> 03:18:09.954]  We won't take any money from AIPAC.
[03:18:09.954 --> 03:18:17.620]  We won't take any money from corporate lobbyists who earn their money from oppressing people and violence.
[03:18:17.620 --> 03:18:20.382]  You know, Cindy, I don't want to waste any of my time with you.
[03:18:20.382 --> 03:18:26.147]  I'm going to skip this four-minute break and then come back right at the bottom of the hour at 30 after.
[03:18:26.147 --> 03:18:28.489]  So we've got exactly 10 minutes left with Cindy Sheehan.
[03:18:28.489 --> 03:18:33.213]  We're going to skip this break for all the InfoWars.com stream listeners, that exclusive stream.
[03:18:33.213 --> 03:18:33.733]  Got to go there.
[03:18:33.733 --> 03:18:35.775]  Not the GCN stream, but the InfoWars stream.
[03:18:36.195 --> 03:18:38.476]  And, of course, watching on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:18:38.476 --> 03:18:41.437]  We'll be right back.
[03:18:41.437 --> 03:18:50.421]  Cindy, let's continue with grassroots, what people can do who are in California, who are on the West Coast particularly, but also nationwide.
[03:18:50.421 --> 03:18:56.104]  I mean, people can call into talk shows from, if they're in New York, they can call San Francisco talk shows.
[03:18:56.104 --> 03:18:57.645]  I mean, explain your district.
[03:18:57.645 --> 03:18:58.925]  I mean, there's so much.
[03:18:58.925 --> 03:19:01.266]  Letter-writing campaigns, postcards.
[03:19:01.266 --> 03:19:04.808]  I mean, if everybody does a little bit, we can get you elected.
[03:19:05.626 --> 03:19:06.487]  Yes.
[03:19:06.487 --> 03:19:07.247]  Awesome.
[03:19:07.247 --> 03:19:08.408]  Tell folks about that right now.
[03:19:08.408 --> 03:19:10.429]  We're still on air.
[03:19:10.429 --> 03:19:11.269]  Oh, okay.
[03:19:11.269 --> 03:19:13.230]  I just skipped the break.
[03:19:13.230 --> 03:19:13.711]  Okay.
[03:19:13.711 --> 03:19:14.131]  All right.
[03:19:14.131 --> 03:19:16.532]  Awesome.
[03:19:16.532 --> 03:19:18.914]  Well, let me see.
[03:19:18.914 --> 03:19:20.415]  Where do we start?
[03:19:20.415 --> 03:19:23.496]  First of all, we accept donations.
[03:19:23.496 --> 03:19:24.817]  No amount is too small.
[03:19:24.817 --> 03:19:29.820]  We put every dollar to work in our campaign office.
[03:19:30.290 --> 03:19:39.275]  We are going to have a grassroots section that's coming up really soon where people from outside the district, like you said, could phone bank for us.
[03:19:39.275 --> 03:19:46.499]  They can send postcards inside the district to people explaining why they support me.
[03:19:46.499 --> 03:19:50.341]  We are going to have canvassing and voter registration.
[03:19:50.341 --> 03:19:55.184]  There's so many people in San Francisco who are not registered to vote that are
[03:19:56.539 --> 03:20:00.020]  You know, they're qualified to be registered to vote, but they're not.
[03:20:00.020 --> 03:20:11.023]  They have felt so left out of the process for the last few decades when the corporate control and the rich, you know, established elitists have taken control of the country.
[03:20:11.023 --> 03:20:13.884]  And that's the only people that Nancy Pelosi represents.
[03:20:13.884 --> 03:20:22.827]  She doesn't represent my neighbor on the street who can't afford to buy gas, who are, you know, they're losing their homes and their jobs.
[03:20:23.376 --> 03:20:27.980]  So we're going to do a very targeted grassroots voter registration.
[03:20:27.980 --> 03:20:29.161]  Get out the vote.
[03:20:29.161 --> 03:20:34.826]  We're going to give people... Nancy Poste always brags that she gives 80% of the vote.
[03:20:34.826 --> 03:20:41.031]  She gives 80% of about 20 to 25% of the people who actually come out to vote.
[03:20:41.031 --> 03:20:44.594]  So that's a very, very small percentage.
[03:20:44.594 --> 03:20:50.739]  So we're going to energize people who haven't voted for a long time to go back to the polls.
[03:20:51.195 --> 03:20:53.636]  To give them a reason to go back and vote.
[03:20:53.636 --> 03:20:57.098]  We collected almost 20,000 signatures.
[03:20:57.098 --> 03:21:03.582]  That's halfway to what we need to defeat Nancy Pelosi in November.
[03:21:03.582 --> 03:21:06.103]  And we haven't even started campaigning yet.
[03:21:06.103 --> 03:21:19.390]  So I think that with the help of people around America who realize the historic importance of this election, who realize that they have to do more, not write your congressperson now,
[03:21:19.898 --> 03:21:38.667]  You know, not support the two-party duopoly that really is just one party, but work for a candidate who will bring this fundamental change, who will start... You know, I'm a supporter of the Constitution.
[03:21:38.667 --> 03:21:49.493]  I believe that we have... I believe in the Second Amendment that we have a right to keep and bear arms, and we know, historically, that was to protect us from the government.
[03:21:49.949 --> 03:21:55.732]  But I am just fearful of an armed revolution against this government.
[03:21:55.732 --> 03:21:56.993]  They have Blackwater.
[03:21:56.993 --> 03:22:07.118]  They have, you know, every conceivable weapon that they... Well, Nancy, studying the history of warfare, they will lose if that physical fight starts.
[03:22:07.118 --> 03:22:11.641]  But what we might get out of the revolution may be an even worse government, is what history shows.
[03:22:11.641 --> 03:22:13.021]  We can certainly win it.
[03:22:13.021 --> 03:22:14.022]  Every time.
[03:22:14.022 --> 03:22:16.103]  Every time we've gotten a worse government.
[03:22:16.485 --> 03:22:23.833]  So I believe that taking out Nancy Pelosi is just an amazingly peaceful revolution.
[03:22:23.833 --> 03:22:26.976]  We want something like Gandhi did.
[03:22:26.976 --> 03:22:28.297]  We want what Gandhi did.
[03:22:28.297 --> 03:22:29.879]  We want a bloodless revolution.
[03:22:29.879 --> 03:22:31.540]  We all know it really wasn't totally bloodless.
[03:22:31.540 --> 03:22:33.783]  We're going to come back to the full audience right now.
[03:22:33.783 --> 03:22:35.324]  We were behind the scenes just on the internet.
[03:22:35.324 --> 03:22:36.465]  Now we're going to come back.
[03:22:36.465 --> 03:22:39.448]  I want to talk about is Nancy Pelosi scared of you and where this is going.
[03:22:39.448 --> 03:22:39.729]  Here we go.
[03:22:42.448 --> 03:22:48.272]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:22:48.272 --> 03:22:54.035]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:22:54.035 --> 03:23:00.960]  We are streaming this live as television over the internet at PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com.
[03:23:00.960 --> 03:23:02.941]  And we just came back out of the break.
[03:23:02.941 --> 03:23:04.262]  We skipped that break.
[03:23:04.262 --> 03:23:06.143]  Some stations, though, carried that break.
[03:23:06.143 --> 03:23:09.486]  In the time we've got left, you said such incredibly eloquent things there.
[03:23:11.283 --> 03:23:13.203]  Cindy Sheehan, and people should support you right now.
[03:23:13.203 --> 03:23:15.964]  I'm going to support you.
[03:23:15.964 --> 03:23:20.765]  But before we run out of time here, is Nancy Pelosi starting to get scared?
[03:23:20.765 --> 03:23:22.085]  Is she concerned?
[03:23:22.085 --> 03:23:27.086]  Because we know that you're wildly popular, especially in that area of California.
[03:23:27.086 --> 03:23:38.648]  Well, Nancy Pelosi, you know, she's on her book tour in her very ironically titled book, Know Your Power, when she has abdicated her power, or like we said, used her power just to support
[03:23:39.249 --> 03:23:42.431]  The status quo, you know, the fascist police state.
[03:23:42.431 --> 03:23:51.756]  But at her book signing in San Francisco, I heard, I wasn't there, but I heard that people chanted Cindy, Cindy, Cindy for five minutes.
[03:23:51.756 --> 03:24:04.484]  And just the way they started to invalidate our signatures and starting to scrub the voter rolls in San Francisco from the people who support me, I think that they're very terrified.
[03:24:04.484 --> 03:24:08.526]  They're terrified and all they care about is retaining their power.
[03:24:09.187 --> 03:24:09.367]  I don't
[03:24:28.331 --> 03:24:30.712]  And grandchildren of everybody all over the world.
[03:24:30.712 --> 03:24:35.194]  When America is healthy, then the rest of the planet will be healthy.
[03:24:35.194 --> 03:24:42.498]  And I think that with your support, with the support of your listeners, and other people around America, that I can do it.
[03:24:42.498 --> 03:24:44.859]  And I don't feel like I'm there by myself.
[03:24:44.859 --> 03:24:46.200]  I don't call it my campaign.
[03:24:46.200 --> 03:24:47.720]  I call it our campaign.
[03:24:47.720 --> 03:24:53.023]  If there's ever been a campaign in American history that was the People's Campaign, this is it.
[03:24:53.023 --> 03:24:54.003]  Well, Cindy, I agree.
[03:24:55.603 --> 03:24:56.484]  Look at the costs.
[03:24:56.484 --> 03:24:57.264]  They're not going to stop.
[03:24:57.264 --> 03:24:59.066]  They're trying to start war with Russia.
[03:24:59.066 --> 03:25:00.647]  They're trying to reignite the Cold War.
[03:25:00.647 --> 03:25:04.891]  I mean, this craziness isn't going to end until we put our foot down.
[03:25:04.891 --> 03:25:07.633]  And I just appreciate you as a champion getting there and doing that.
[03:25:07.633 --> 03:25:10.716]  People should support you financially and by getting the word out.
[03:25:10.716 --> 03:25:12.417]  We'll get that side out in a moment before you leave us.
[03:25:12.417 --> 03:25:14.919]  But getting back into the fascist police state.
[03:25:15.640 --> 03:25:24.943]  PDD 51, all these police state measures, the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, camps for the American people, a secret prison in Denver, all of that's happening.
[03:25:24.943 --> 03:25:36.227]  Are you concerned about another false flag or another stage 9-11 as a pretext or even with a new administration so the military-industrial complex can continue to move forward?
[03:25:36.227 --> 03:25:39.328]  Well, as you know, the Presidential Directive 51,
[03:25:42.213 --> 03:25:52.960]  It gives George Bush the right to declare martial law without congressional approval, but it doesn't have to be a terrorist attack.
[03:25:52.960 --> 03:26:00.145]  He could declare martial law economic or a natural disaster.
[03:26:00.145 --> 03:26:08.190]  So, you know, yes, that's very terrifying, and many people think that they're not going to even allow the elections to happen in November.
[03:26:08.854 --> 03:26:13.776]  So if there was ever a time that the people need to take back their power, it's today.
[03:26:13.776 --> 03:26:14.236]  You're right.
[03:26:14.236 --> 03:26:15.537]  This is the time to be vigilant.
[03:26:15.537 --> 03:26:16.837]  This is the crossroads.
[03:26:16.837 --> 03:26:19.498]  This is when the global system is liquid.
[03:26:19.498 --> 03:26:22.219]  Things are changing fast for good or ill.
[03:26:22.219 --> 03:26:24.040]  We're going to be the difference we want to see in the world.
[03:26:24.040 --> 03:26:33.044]  Like Gandhi said, look in the mirror every day and that's where you're going to find the solution with our creator's help and with great champions out there like Cindy Sheehan.
[03:26:33.044 --> 03:26:33.644]  9-11 investigation.
[03:26:36.605 --> 03:26:40.108]  Now all these Republican memos come out saying we need a new 9-11.
[03:26:40.108 --> 03:26:40.868]  9-11 would be great.
[03:26:40.868 --> 03:26:50.394]  Cy Hirsch reports that Dick Cheney just proposed attacking our own ships with fake PT boats with Navy SEALs dressed up like Iranians.
[03:26:50.394 --> 03:26:52.415]  Would you like to see a bigger investigation of that?
[03:26:52.415 --> 03:26:59.639]  Well you know I have always called for a valid investigation into 9-11.
[03:27:01.039 --> 03:27:11.027]  It has nothing to do with the government, but it has experts and Latina power, and that we, um, these people need to swear an oath.
[03:27:11.027 --> 03:27:15.390]  Like, that just cracks me up because they don't care about swearing an oath.
[03:27:15.390 --> 03:27:17.772]  You know, it means nothing to them.
[03:27:17.772 --> 03:27:19.413]  But yes, definitely.
[03:27:19.413 --> 03:27:23.776]  And I have the families of 9-11 to call for that.
[03:27:23.776 --> 03:27:25.978]  The 9-11 investigation that we had was a joke.
[03:27:27.810 --> 03:27:38.955]  What do you think of the courage of Willie Nelson and Jesse Ventura and the former Italian president and the best actress this year, winner, all coming out saying inside job.
[03:27:38.955 --> 03:27:40.696]  What do you think about that?
[03:27:40.696 --> 03:27:42.457]  Well, you know, I think that takes a lot of courage.
[03:27:42.457 --> 03:27:45.698]  And as you know, Alex, I've never been, I've never said inside job.
[03:27:45.698 --> 03:27:49.559]  I've never been convinced by anybody that it wasn't inside job.
[03:27:49.559 --> 03:27:51.580]  You just say it needs to be investigated.
[03:27:51.580 --> 03:27:54.882]  You know that I know, you know that I think that there's so many,
[03:27:56.354 --> 03:28:04.700]  Irregularities and so many questionable things that happen that I'm not ruling Inside Job out at all.
[03:28:04.700 --> 03:28:06.202]  But I haven't been convinced of that.
[03:28:06.202 --> 03:28:12.386]  But you did, I mean, did you hear two weeks ago, even Keith Overman covered it, that Cheney wanted to attack our ships with fake Iranian boats?
[03:28:12.386 --> 03:28:12.827]  I did.
[03:28:12.827 --> 03:28:13.607]  No, I heard that.
[03:28:13.607 --> 03:28:14.308]  I heard that, yes.
[03:28:14.308 --> 03:28:15.929]  I mean, that's bombshell, isn't it?
[03:28:15.929 --> 03:28:16.970]  That's what they wanted to do.
[03:28:16.970 --> 03:28:18.811]  That's what they wanted to do for Ross.
[03:28:18.811 --> 03:28:21.413]  They wanted to... Tell you what, I'm going to skip this break, Cindy.
[03:28:21.413 --> 03:28:22.374]  Stay there for three more minutes.
[03:28:24.275 --> 03:28:28.258]  We're talking to Cindy Sheehan, behind the scenes at Infowars.com.
[03:28:28.258 --> 03:28:30.059]  Okay, Cindy, we've got three minutes left here.
[03:28:30.059 --> 03:28:33.462]  This is going out over the internet, then it's put up on YouTube and everywhere.
[03:28:33.462 --> 03:28:34.743]  Continue finishing up with that.
[03:28:34.743 --> 03:28:43.470]  I mean, that's a big deal when we get these... Well, I think they wanted to provoke Saddam into attacking us because they knew they couldn't get the U.N.
[03:28:43.470 --> 03:28:44.270]  resolution.
[03:28:44.270 --> 03:28:44.811]  White House memo.
[03:28:44.811 --> 03:28:46.392]  These people are monsters.
[03:28:46.392 --> 03:28:51.296]  These people will stop at nothing to have all the power, all the money,
[03:28:52.264 --> 03:28:53.065]  I think so.
[03:29:05.598 --> 03:29:09.039]  A very strong investigation into 9-11.
[03:29:09.039 --> 03:29:09.739]  Well, exactly.
[03:29:09.739 --> 03:29:10.619]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:29:10.619 --> 03:29:15.480]  We have Cy Hirsch saying, oh, my White House source, they plan to attack 12 targets.
[03:29:15.480 --> 03:29:22.702]  One of them was to create fake Iranian boats in our shipyards, put Navy SEALs on board and have them attack our ships and have a shootout.
[03:29:22.702 --> 03:29:24.723]  And then somebody in the White House overruled him.
[03:29:24.723 --> 03:29:25.423]  My point is,
[03:29:26.603 --> 03:29:28.544]  Then we have the White House memo, flying U.S.
[03:29:28.544 --> 03:29:30.564]  planes low, painted like U.N.
[03:29:30.564 --> 03:29:34.365]  But this is even worse, though, to actually attack our own ships.
[03:29:34.365 --> 03:29:35.666]  I mean, that's Cy Hearst.
[03:29:35.666 --> 03:29:36.846]  That's Keith Oberman.
[03:29:36.846 --> 03:29:39.027]  I mean, you've got a big voice, Cindy.
[03:29:39.027 --> 03:29:43.688]  I know you're bringing that up, but will you bring that up to the media?
[03:29:43.688 --> 03:29:46.789]  Well, you know, I have whenever I have an opportunity.
[03:29:46.789 --> 03:29:47.329]  No, I know.
[03:29:47.329 --> 03:29:48.589]  You've just got a lot of power.
[03:29:48.589 --> 03:29:51.310]  And I'm glad I have the opportunity today.
[03:29:52.199 --> 03:29:53.399]  Well, you're just awesome.
[03:29:53.399 --> 03:29:58.201]  I mean, did that blow you away when you heard that Cheney was planning that?
[03:29:58.201 --> 03:30:02.583]  You know, nothing that these people do blow me away anymore.
[03:30:02.583 --> 03:30:04.944]  You know what blows me away?
[03:30:04.944 --> 03:30:07.485]  Is that we have allowed them to get away with it.
[03:30:07.485 --> 03:30:08.265]  Yes.
[03:30:08.265 --> 03:30:09.806]  That's what blows me away.
[03:30:09.806 --> 03:30:11.206]  Yes, absolutely.
[03:30:11.206 --> 03:30:14.167]  Well, you're not letting them get away with it, and we just appreciate you.
[03:30:14.167 --> 03:30:15.968]  Give out the congressional website one more time.
[03:30:17.179 --> 03:30:19.059]  Cindy4Congress.org.
[03:30:19.059 --> 03:30:22.180]  Cindy S-O-R Congress.org.
[03:30:22.180 --> 03:30:23.200]  I don't want to put you on the spot.
[03:30:23.200 --> 03:30:28.362]  I know you're in a car waiting to go into an event on the campaign trail, but do you have the phone numbers?
[03:30:28.362 --> 03:30:36.584]  We have a lot of AM and FM shortwave satellite listeners that aren't at computers and don't have computers that want to call you a lot of elderly... Yes, I do.
[03:30:36.584 --> 03:30:37.244]  It's Erica 415-621-5027.
[03:30:37.244 --> 03:30:38.104]  Give it out again.
[03:30:38.104 --> 03:30:38.144]  415-621-5027.
[03:30:48.238 --> 03:30:50.520]  I'm doing an anti-war concert.
[03:30:50.520 --> 03:30:52.822]  It's already set up, but I don't want to announce it until a little bit.
[03:30:52.822 --> 03:30:58.246]  In October, with Willie Nelson and Jesse Ventura, maybe we can fly you in here or get you in there to be a speaker.
[03:30:58.246 --> 03:30:59.927]  I don't want to put too many speakers in there.
[03:30:59.927 --> 03:31:01.528]  I'll end up not having time to speak.
[03:31:01.528 --> 03:31:05.872]  But maybe we'll get you into Austin, Cindy, and I'll call your... Well, that would be great.
[03:31:05.872 --> 03:31:06.352]  I love Austin.
[03:31:06.352 --> 03:31:07.913]  I miss my friends there.
[03:31:07.913 --> 03:31:09.935]  Well, I know you lived right outside it for a year.
[03:31:12.591 --> 03:31:17.832]  How long total, if you put it all the times together, were you out there at Camp Casey and before?
[03:31:17.832 --> 03:31:19.733]  Oh, gosh.
[03:31:19.733 --> 03:31:21.013]  Months, like you said.
[03:31:21.013 --> 03:31:22.634]  Yeah, off and on a lot.
[03:31:22.634 --> 03:31:25.754]  Okay, well, SydneyForCongress.org, you said?
[03:31:25.754 --> 03:31:27.435]  Yes.
[03:31:27.435 --> 03:31:29.235]  Okay, thank you for everything you're doing.
[03:31:29.235 --> 03:31:30.256]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:31:30.256 --> 03:31:34.117]  Hopefully we can come back on and update you on how things are going.
[03:31:34.117 --> 03:31:35.017]  Please do.
[03:31:35.017 --> 03:31:38.418]  You've got a platform, and we'll just call you in a month and check in with you.
[03:31:38.418 --> 03:31:38.878]  God bless you.
[03:31:39.867 --> 03:31:40.228]  Awesome.
[03:31:40.228 --> 03:31:42.074]  God bless you all and your listeners, too.
[03:31:42.074 --> 03:31:42.856]  Thank you.
[03:31:42.856 --> 03:31:43.157]  You bet.
[03:31:43.157 --> 03:31:44.280]  There goes Cindy Sheehan.
[03:31:44.280 --> 03:31:46.085]  Bye-bye, Cindy.
[03:31:46.085 --> 03:31:46.667]  Okay, here we go.
[03:31:51.988 --> 03:31:53.729]  You know, I'm going to play part of two songs.
[03:31:53.729 --> 03:31:59.592]  Let's play Top Ranking, because I've been skipping so many breaks, I need a break to go to the lavatory, the boys' room, as they say.
[03:31:59.592 --> 03:32:05.355]  And then, I know we played it once on air, I know you've got it in cue, that Janis Joplin, Freedom, or whatever the name of the song is.
[03:32:05.355 --> 03:32:13.039]  Freedom's just another word for nothing else to lose, and there's nothing, there's nothing if you ain't free, or whatever she says.
[03:32:13.039 --> 03:32:15.861]  Try to cue that up, but get me Top Ranking, I need to... It's ready.
[03:32:15.861 --> 03:32:19.383]  The point is, I love this song so bad, I won't even have time to get out of here, I have to sit here and listen to it.
[03:32:20.003 --> 03:32:20.863]  This says it all.
[03:32:20.863 --> 03:32:25.685]  Again, I have always built people up, brought countless people on to raise money.
[03:32:25.685 --> 03:32:28.066]  You, the listeners, have given, given, given.
[03:32:28.066 --> 03:32:33.709]  We have come on here selflessly to build up other talk shows, other filmmakers, everybody.
[03:32:33.709 --> 03:32:39.251]  And we just all need to come together and fight the New World Order and stop killing each other.
[03:32:39.251 --> 03:32:39.771]  That's what they want.
[03:32:39.771 --> 03:32:42.612]  They want us fighting, fussing and fighting and killing each other.
[03:32:42.612 --> 03:32:48.915]  And I have so much brotherly love for people, but I do get just, not even enraged, it's like disgusted
[03:32:49.827 --> 03:33:02.793]  with the fact that so many bad people know that there's power in the anti-new world order movement and get into it and we have to identify these wolves and we have to route them out but then that itself becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy of just infighting.
[03:33:02.793 --> 03:33:08.356]  Let's just listen to the words of the Rasta man, Mr. Naughty Dread.
[03:33:08.356 --> 03:33:12.618]  Here it is.
[03:33:12.618 --> 03:33:16.180]  They don't want to see us
[03:33:17.864 --> 03:33:18.524]  No!
[03:33:18.524 --> 03:33:21.365]  I want to see us fussing and fighting!
[03:33:21.365 --> 03:33:27.346]  All they want us to do is keep on fussing and fighting.
[03:33:27.346 --> 03:33:30.926]  They don't want to see us live together.
[03:33:30.926 --> 03:33:41.308]  All they want us to do is keep on killing one another.
[03:33:41.308 --> 03:33:43.149]  Top ranking!
[03:33:43.149 --> 03:33:44.409]  Top ranking!
[03:33:46.138 --> 03:33:48.199]  Did you mean what you said?
[03:33:48.199 --> 03:33:50.640]  Are you skankin'?
[03:33:50.640 --> 03:33:52.861]  Are you skankin'?
[03:33:52.861 --> 03:33:54.862]  And boy, your lies blew up in your face, didn't they?
[03:33:54.862 --> 03:33:55.743]  Oh, top rankin'!
[03:33:55.743 --> 03:33:56.463]  Top rankin'!
[03:33:56.463 --> 03:33:58.264]  Oh, did you mean what you said?
[03:33:58.264 --> 03:33:59.204]  Are you skankin'?
[03:33:59.204 --> 03:33:59.404]  Skankin'!
[03:33:59.404 --> 03:33:59.825]  Are you skankin'?

[03:34:02.546 --> 03:34:03.326]  Skankin'!
[03:34:03.326 --> 03:34:03.866]  Skankin'!
[03:34:03.866 --> 03:34:04.087]  Skankin'!
[03:34:04.087 --> 03:34:04.327]  Skankin'!
[03:34:04.327 --> 03:34:04.727]  Skankin'!
[03:34:04.727 --> 03:34:04.987]  Skankin'!
[03:34:04.987 --> 03:34:05.207]  Skankin'!
[03:34:05.207 --> 03:34:05.647]  Skankin'!
[03:34:05.647 --> 03:34:06.168]  Skankin'!
[03:34:06.168 --> 03:34:06.448]  Skankin'!

[03:34:07.228 --> 03:34:07.528]  Skankin'!
[03:34:07.528 --> 03:34:07.828]  Skankin'!
[03:34:07.828 --> 03:34:08.088]  Skankin'!
[03:34:08.088 --> 03:34:08.329]  Skankin'!

[03:34:08.689 --> 03:34:09.429]  Skankin'!
[03:34:09.429 --> 03:34:09.829]  Skankin'!
[03:34:09.829 --> 03:34:10.129]  Skankin'!
[03:34:10.129 --> 03:34:10.350]  Skankin'!
[03:34:10.350 --> 03:34:10.770]  Skankin'!
[03:34:10.770 --> 03:34:11.370]  Skankin'!
[03:34:11.370 --> 03:34:11.910]  Skankin'!
[03:34:11.910 --> 03:34:12.371]  Skankin'!
[03:34:12.371 --> 03:34:12.951]  Skankin'!
[03:34:12.951 --> 03:34:13.351]  Skankin'!
[03:34:13.351 --> 03:34:13.691]  Skankin'!
[03:34:13.691 --> 03:34:13.911]  Skankin'!

[03:34:14.712 --> 03:34:15.272]  Skankin'!
[03:34:15.272 --> 03:34:15.412]  Skankin
[03:34:16.849 --> 03:34:22.752]  John saw them coming!
[03:34:22.752 --> 03:34:27.174]  The brotherly love!
[03:34:46.616 --> 03:34:53.301]  I feel this morning.
[03:34:53.301 --> 03:34:55.482]  Never accuse me of what you are.
[03:34:55.482 --> 03:34:57.944]  You know, you don't really hate me.
[03:34:57.944 --> 03:34:59.665]  You hate yourselves.
[03:34:59.665 --> 03:35:01.966]  My enemies.
[03:35:01.966 --> 03:35:05.929]  And I take no pleasure that you're imprisoned inside your own evil mind.
[03:35:05.929 --> 03:35:14.355]  All they want us to do is keep on fussing.
[03:35:17.441 --> 03:35:20.843]  You guys are laughing at me.
[03:35:20.843 --> 03:35:28.088]  No, I know I sound funny, but that's from my heart.
[03:35:28.088 --> 03:35:30.310]  I love everybody.
[03:35:46.380 --> 03:35:51.644]  Yeah, you're a bunch of skanks.
[03:35:51.644 --> 03:35:56.468]  Dirty, creepy, little back-biting, back-stabbing devils.
[03:35:56.468 --> 03:36:00.492]  Skankin', skankin'!
[03:36:00.492 --> 03:36:03.434]  Yeah!
[03:36:03.434 --> 03:36:05.356]  Stop rankin'!
[03:36:05.356 --> 03:36:10.040]  Alright, did you find my Janice Joplin?
[03:36:11.075 --> 03:36:11.795]  I'm still looking for it.
[03:36:11.795 --> 03:36:13.696]  You're still looking for my Janice Joplin?
[03:36:13.696 --> 03:36:17.876]  It's in that evil, confounded, 12-year-old computer they have up there.
[03:36:17.876 --> 03:36:21.137]  They torture John with the equipment up there.
[03:36:21.137 --> 03:36:23.877]  Oh man, I am just exhausted.
[03:36:23.877 --> 03:36:25.278]  I got up at like 6 a.m.
[03:36:25.278 --> 03:36:31.059]  yesterday, then I was on coast-to-coast last night, and I got work to do just to the rafters.
[03:36:31.059 --> 03:36:33.499]  To the rafters.
[03:36:33.499 --> 03:36:34.159]  But you know what?
[03:36:34.159 --> 03:36:35.240]  It is rewarding.
[03:36:35.240 --> 03:36:36.480]  I am so alive.
[03:36:38.445 --> 03:36:40.627]  I just, I also want to just somehow slow down.
[03:36:40.627 --> 03:36:46.871]  It's like, I love working, but I can't even get off of the treadmill.
[03:36:46.871 --> 03:36:51.094]  I am just like continually focused on this.
[03:36:51.094 --> 03:36:53.016]  Well, there's a great story up on JonesReport.com.
[03:36:53.016 --> 03:37:06.245]  I talked about it back in the first hour, and when the show restarts on InfoWars.com on the exclusive streams there, the higher quality streams, more streams, better streams, there at the InfoWars.com streams when the show's over in about 21 minutes,
[03:37:07.970 --> 03:37:08.890]  It will restart.
[03:37:08.890 --> 03:37:10.511]  We will be right back.
[03:37:10.511 --> 03:37:16.794]  And I went over that because it's pointless for me to go over that now because I'm going to go over it again when we start that other hour.
[03:37:16.794 --> 03:37:21.637]  But I wanted to get into some of the other environmental news here.
[03:37:21.637 --> 03:37:22.877]  I want to hear Janis Joplin.
[03:37:22.877 --> 03:37:25.079]  My bones need to hear that song.
[03:37:25.079 --> 03:37:27.120]  That's Tommy McGee's the name of the song.
[03:37:27.120 --> 03:37:27.700]  Bobby McGee.
[03:37:27.700 --> 03:37:28.360]  Bobby McGee.
[03:37:28.360 --> 03:37:28.740]  There you go.
[03:37:28.740 --> 03:37:29.761]  It's downloading.
[03:37:29.761 --> 03:37:30.641]  It's downloading.
[03:37:30.641 --> 03:37:31.742]  Oh, we're having to grab it again.
[03:37:34.943 --> 03:37:36.304]  Chris Christopherson wrote that.
[03:37:36.304 --> 03:37:37.824]  That's interesting.
[03:37:37.824 --> 03:37:39.565]  That's right, because they were going out together.
[03:37:39.565 --> 03:37:41.226]  They just popped in in here.
[03:37:41.226 --> 03:37:43.367]  I can't even get these names straight.
[03:37:43.367 --> 03:37:45.067]  The Goodly Trey.
[03:37:45.067 --> 03:37:50.310]  Can I see the other goodly creatures out the window?
[03:37:50.310 --> 03:37:50.690]  You know what?
[03:37:50.690 --> 03:37:54.932]  Play, while you're downloading that, play Babylon.
[03:37:54.932 --> 03:37:57.313]  The Bob Marley about the vampires.
[03:37:58.936 --> 03:38:01.738]  The Babylon system is the vampire.
[03:38:01.738 --> 03:38:04.040]  Let me load it up, one second.
[03:38:04.040 --> 03:38:08.603]  Babylon system is the vampire.
[03:38:08.603 --> 03:38:11.685]  Always sucking the blood of the children.
[03:38:11.685 --> 03:38:14.767]  That's it.
[03:38:14.767 --> 03:38:16.508]  God, I hate vampires.
[03:38:16.508 --> 03:38:19.150]  Psychic vampires are just everywhere.
[03:38:19.150 --> 03:38:19.971]  It's ready.
[03:38:19.971 --> 03:38:20.691]  Yeah, here it is.
[03:38:20.691 --> 03:38:24.174]  This is a song dedicated to all the psychic vampires out there.
[03:38:24.174 --> 03:38:28.377]  Miserable creatures that will be defeated trying to suck the blood.
[03:38:34.906 --> 03:38:35.507]  It's too long!
[03:38:35.507 --> 03:38:36.247]  Rebellion!
[03:38:36.247 --> 03:38:37.268]  Rebellion!
[03:38:37.268 --> 03:38:42.693]  Babylon system is the vampire, yeah
[03:39:02.321 --> 03:39:25.600]  The Babylon system is a vampire Falling empire Sucking the blood of the sufferers Building churches and universities
[03:39:31.779 --> 03:39:32.619]  Oh, yeah!
[03:39:32.619 --> 03:39:39.042]  This evening, the people continually, yeah, miss a dance.
[03:39:39.042 --> 03:39:41.342]  Ratcheting thieves and murderers.
[03:39:41.342 --> 03:39:45.584]  Look out now, they're sucking the blood
[03:40:12.028 --> 03:40:12.628]  Hey Jones.
[03:40:43.635 --> 03:40:44.436]  Yeah, we're on air right now.
[03:41:12.071 --> 03:41:15.913]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, the immortal Bob Marley.
[03:41:15.913 --> 03:41:21.617]  The Babylon system is the vampire.
[03:41:21.617 --> 03:41:27.500]  I'm going to play part of Bobby McGee, and here it is for you, ladies and gentlemen, on the one and only GCN Radio Network.
[03:41:27.500 --> 03:41:34.625]  I'm going to come back and hit some final news for the last 15 minutes in the zone here before retransmission launches.
[03:41:34.625 --> 03:41:37.506]  T-minus 16 minutes.
[03:41:37.506 --> 03:41:37.987]  Stay with us.
[03:41:41.789 --> 03:42:07.720]  Busted flat in Baton Rouge Waitin' for a train When I feel the nearest faded as my jeans Bobby thumbed a diesel down Just before it rained And rode us all the way to New Orleans I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
[03:42:08.519 --> 03:42:32.612]  I was playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues When she wore her serpentine I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine We sang every song that Javi knew Freedom is just another word for nothin' left to lose Nothin', don't mean nothin' honey if it ain't free
[03:42:37.941 --> 03:42:38.802]  I don't know.
[03:42:52.450 --> 03:43:02.322]  From the Kentucky coal mine to the California sun, Hey Bobby shared the secrets of my soul.
[03:43:02.322 --> 03:43:11.233]  Through all kinds of weather, through everything we've done, Hey Bobby, baby, kept me from the cold.
[03:43:14.193 --> 03:43:15.153]  I don't think so.
[03:43:49.187 --> 03:43:52.108]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[03:43:52.108 --> 03:43:53.069]  to 3 p.m.
[03:43:53.069 --> 03:43:56.810]  Central Standard Time for four hours we're live.
[03:43:56.810 --> 03:44:00.732]  Back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:44:00.732 --> 03:44:03.893]  with an abbreviated beginning of the week transmission.
[03:44:18.100 --> 03:44:20.160]  It's a free podcast at InfoWars.com.
[03:44:20.160 --> 03:44:38.524]  More than 60,000 people a day and growing are downloading the free podcast at InfoWars.com and PresentPlanet.com with their MP3 or iPod device to listen to how they want, when they want, where they want.
[03:44:38.524 --> 03:44:44.225]  Millions and millions every month tune in just over the internet to listen to the radio show, to read the shoutcast stats.
[03:44:44.225 --> 03:44:45.205]  Click on stats at the top
[03:44:46.010 --> 03:44:56.438]  Millions more listen on a growing list of fabulous Eminem affiliates and good old WWCR, Worldwide Shortwave International Service, as well as Satellite.
[03:44:56.438 --> 03:44:59.320]  We're thankful to all the listeners, the sponsors.
[03:44:59.320 --> 03:45:04.544]  We're thankful for everyone that has made this show possible and who have resonated with the message that we brought forward.
[03:45:04.544 --> 03:45:06.586]  And together, we have woken up tens of millions.
[03:45:06.586 --> 03:45:08.808]  We will wake up tens of millions more.
[03:45:08.808 --> 03:45:14.012]  And we're going to give this New World Order dehumanization system one hell of a fight, thanks to all of you and the good Lord above.
[03:45:15.600 --> 03:45:20.729]  I've got some final news I want to hit in the 15 minutes that we have left here today.
[03:45:22.039 --> 03:45:31.809]  Of course, there's a key story up on PrisonPlanet.com that I covered in detail earlier in the show that we'll rebroadcast in a few minutes, but a Russian general says Georgia may commit false flag terror attacks.
[03:45:31.809 --> 03:45:40.357]  The deputy head of the Russian military, number two, says that he's afraid U.S.-backed forces may pose as Russian military and stage false flag events.
[03:45:40.357 --> 03:45:41.859]  Now, the Russians are not angels.
[03:45:41.859 --> 03:45:43.420]  If you remember, they could do that as well.
[03:45:43.420 --> 03:45:45.983]  Just be aware of the false flag type operation.
[03:45:46.563 --> 03:45:52.633]  Also speaking of Georgia, Joe Biden promises Georgia a billion dollars.
[03:45:52.633 --> 03:45:59.704]  The Senate fixture from Delaware, this is by Kurt Nemo, InfoWorks.com, Joe Biden has promised to give your money to the
[03:46:01.417 --> 03:46:04.698]  Horn dictator, Chakasvili, and Georgia.
[03:46:04.698 --> 03:46:08.159]  The United States will consider providing $1 billion in emergency aid to Georgia, a top U.S.
[03:46:08.159 --> 03:46:14.501]  lawmaker said today, on his return from a visit to the conflict-torn nation, reports Dow Jones Newswire.
[03:46:14.501 --> 03:46:21.623]  When Congress reconvenes, I intend to work with the administration to seek congressional approval for $1 billion in emergency assistance from Georgia, said Biden.
[03:46:21.623 --> 03:46:30.286]  This money will help the people of Georgia recover from the damage that has been inflicted on our country, our economy, and send a clear message that the United States will not abandon this young democracy.
[03:46:31.593 --> 03:46:35.615]  Actually, Biden has promised to jack the debt up another billion or so.
[03:46:35.615 --> 03:46:35.955]  The U.S.
[03:46:35.955 --> 03:46:42.558]  debt is now over $100 trillion, so that a mere billion the government says is debt is only $10 trillion.
[03:46:42.558 --> 03:46:48.140]  But the Federal Reserve and the Federal Express says it's closer to $100 trillion, which means
[03:46:51.013 --> 03:46:52.854]  It is over that amount.
[03:46:52.854 --> 03:46:55.495]  At any rate, Biden is simply taking orders from the globalists.
[03:46:55.495 --> 03:46:58.095]  Biden is the head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
[03:46:58.095 --> 03:47:04.418]  It might well be called the Council on Foreign Relations Committee because that's where the marching orders come from.
[03:47:04.418 --> 03:47:14.641]  Russia punched some pretty big holes in the globalist plan for little Georgia and the CIA created client state so the American people have to ante up.
[03:47:14.641 --> 03:47:16.822]  And it goes on a little bit more from there.
[03:47:18.717 --> 03:47:25.679]  Continuing, ladies and gentlemen, Credit Crunch may take out large U.S.
[03:47:25.679 --> 03:47:29.160]  bank Warren's former IMF chief.
[03:47:29.160 --> 03:47:43.305]  They told us eight months ago that the bank foreclosures and the bank collapses were over and the housing foreclosures were over and it just got worse two months later and then they told us six months ago it was getting better and then a couple months later it's got worse and got worse last month and it's worse this month.
[03:47:43.305 --> 03:47:43.905]  The deepening
[03:47:45.342 --> 03:47:49.485]  Toll from global financial crisis could trigger the failure of a large U.S.
[03:47:49.485 --> 03:47:58.553]  bank within months, a respected former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund claimed today, fueling another battering for banking shares.
[03:47:58.553 --> 03:48:12.604]  Professor Kenneth Rogoff, a leading academic economist, said that there was yet worse news to come from the worldwide credit crunch and financial turmoil, particularly in the United States, and that a high-profile
[03:48:13.717 --> 03:48:16.323]  Casualty among American banks was highly likely.
[03:48:16.323 --> 03:48:17.145]  The U.S.
[03:48:17.145 --> 03:48:18.970]  is not out of the woods.
[03:48:18.970 --> 03:48:19.290]  What is it?
[03:48:19.290 --> 03:48:19.992]  Bank of America?
[03:48:19.992 --> 03:48:20.694]  Is it Citibank?
[03:48:20.694 --> 03:48:21.155]  Who's next?
[03:48:22.082 --> 03:48:25.183]  I think the financial crisis is at the halfway point, perhaps.
[03:48:25.183 --> 03:48:31.426]  I would even go further to say that the worst is yet to come, Professor Rogoff said at a conference in Singapore.
[03:48:31.426 --> 03:48:37.488]  In an ominous warning, he added, we're just not going to see mid-sized banks go under.
[03:48:37.488 --> 03:48:40.089]  We're not just going to see mid-sized banks go under the next few months.
[03:48:40.089 --> 03:48:42.090]  We're going to see a whopper.
[03:48:42.090 --> 03:48:44.170]  We're going to see a big one.
[03:48:44.170 --> 03:48:48.332]  One of the big investment banks, or the big banks, he said, rising anxieties.
[03:48:50.285 --> 03:48:50.885]  Over.
[03:48:50.885 --> 03:48:56.607]  Worst to come in the credit crisis since shares tumbling in Europe and Asia.
[03:48:56.607 --> 03:49:02.330]  And then it gets into all of that news and information for you.
[03:49:02.330 --> 03:49:04.951]  When we come back I want to get into the latest global warming.
[03:49:05.953 --> 03:49:13.064]  Which means global tax, global regulation, social workers managing every facet of your life, taxing and tracking everything you do.
[03:49:13.064 --> 03:49:17.150]  We'll come back and hit some news on that and wrap up this transmission.
[03:49:17.150 --> 03:49:17.912]  Stay the course.
[03:49:17.912 --> 03:49:20.836]  And as I said, I covered so much key information.
[03:49:21.958 --> 03:49:39.273]  In the first hour on the whole esoteric agenda and this new connection to the first Matrix movie 2911 so that'll be covered during the rebroadcast you want to find out what happened there when the show is over in t-minus exactly nine minutes and one second from now
[03:49:41.360 --> 03:49:45.124]  The pressures of everyday life can deliver a serious blow to your health.
[03:49:45.124 --> 03:49:50.749]  Stress increases blood pressure, potential heart problems, strokes, ulcers, depression, and insomnia.
[03:49:50.749 --> 03:49:54.012]  Stress suppresses your immune system and inhibits weight control.
[03:49:54.012 --> 03:49:56.695]  Stress makes you nervous, anxious, or irritable.
[03:49:56.695 --> 03:49:59.998]  Introducing Nature's Renewal Supreme Anti-Stress Formula.
[03:49:59.998 --> 03:50:05.383]  When you're stressed out or need to ease nervousness, our Supreme Anti-Stress Formula calms simple nervous tension.
[03:50:05.503 --> 03:50:05.903]  I think so.
[03:50:23.297 --> 03:50:23.857]  I don't know.
[03:50:41.235 --> 03:50:44.097]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[03:50:44.097 --> 03:50:45.658]  Loose Change Final Cut.

[03:50:49.700 --> 03:50:51.201]  The late, great USA.
[03:50:51.201 --> 03:50:52.962]  America, freedom to fascism.

[03:52:58.956 --> 03:53:09.404]  The private banking families that own and dominate our planet to a great extent created communism to con the serfs back into slavery.
[03:53:11.015 --> 03:53:12.496]  It's all declassified, all public.
[03:53:12.496 --> 03:53:16.277]  Put Mao in, Lenin, Stalin, all of it.
[03:53:16.277 --> 03:53:23.300]  Now they need a new way to con people into giving up control of their land, what they do, taxing the air we breathe.
[03:53:23.300 --> 03:53:27.362]  One of the four life-giving things that are needed on this planet.
[03:53:27.362 --> 03:53:30.063]  Water, sunlight, oxygen, and carbon dioxide.
[03:53:34.148 --> 03:53:39.352]  And they're going to put on the side of your car, on the sticker in California, what its carbon footprint is.
[03:53:39.352 --> 03:53:43.594]  They're starting to put it on products, shaming you for your great crime you've committed.
[03:53:43.594 --> 03:53:46.596]  Meanwhile, thousands of true environmental things are going on that are horrible.
[03:53:46.596 --> 03:53:47.157]  Doesn't matter.
[03:53:49.403 --> 03:53:51.744]  Japan's doing it, AP reports.
[03:53:51.744 --> 03:53:54.824]  Japan, this is AFP, excuse me, Agency French Press.
[03:53:54.824 --> 03:53:59.045]  Japan to label goods, carbon footprint, officials say.
[03:53:59.045 --> 03:54:08.207]  Japan is planning to label consumer goods to show their carbon footprint in a bid to raise public awareness about global warming, an official said Tuesday.
[03:54:08.207 --> 03:54:17.149]  Under the plan, a select range of products from beverages to detergent will carry markings on the carbon footprint of how much gas responsible for global warming has emitted through production and delivery.
[03:54:18.596 --> 03:54:32.870]  And so this is, you've got to label something before you start taxing it, and they're going to have your carbon credit card, this has all been announced, globally, through your nation, that you will pay taxes on when you go over that carbon allotment.
[03:54:32.870 --> 03:54:34.812]  So, just absolutely amazing there.
[03:54:34.812 --> 03:54:35.172]  Also,
[03:54:36.408 --> 03:54:40.311]  Arctic ice grows 30% in a year, another Paul Watson article.
[03:54:40.311 --> 03:54:44.254]  Predictions of ice-free summer for the first time in history completely debunked.
[03:54:44.254 --> 03:54:56.003]  Alarmist scientists who predicted that North America could be ice-free this summer as a result of global warming have been embarrassed after it was revealed that Arctic ice has actually grown by around 30% in the year since 2007.
[03:54:56.003 --> 03:55:00.747]  Back in June, numerous prominent voices in the scientific community expressed fears of mass melting of the polar ice caps.
[03:55:01.027 --> 03:55:04.410]  They show the ignorant public ice flows and they think that's it breaking up.
[03:55:04.410 --> 03:55:05.731]  It always does it every summer.
[03:55:05.731 --> 03:55:14.217]  Including David Barber, the University of Manitoba, who told National Geographic Magazine we're actually projecting this year that the North Pole may be free of ice for the first time in history.
[03:55:14.217 --> 03:55:21.202]  Then it goes on with the satellite photos and all the documents that it's actually gotten 30% bigger, growing at record rates.
[03:55:21.202 --> 03:55:26.045]  See, people don't know that it rains on top of the glaciers and on top of the Arctic and Antarctic.
[03:55:26.906 --> 03:55:47.694]  The North and South and then they get bigger and then the weight of the mountains it pushes out and then sloughs off and breaks off so it rains in the Arctic and the Antarctic and it builds them up you see and then in the summer it heats up and the edges melt off and fall and they go look it's breaking off it's melting polar bears are drowning hey look it's on a little bitty eye it's hunting
[03:55:49.045 --> 03:55:50.688]  Hunting beluga whale.
[03:55:50.688 --> 03:55:52.111]  It's hunting seals.
[03:55:52.111 --> 03:55:54.495]  These things swim hundreds of miles just hunting.
[03:55:54.495 --> 03:55:57.541]  I mean, all over the news, drowning polar bears.
[03:55:57.541 --> 03:56:01.348]  They treat you like you are complete and total morons.
