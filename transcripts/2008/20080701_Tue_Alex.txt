[00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:05.750]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now well into the fourth and final hour today.
[00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.571]  I've got a lot of news I want to cover.
[00:00:08.251 --> 00:00:14.632]  And then, of course, we're going to have three different folks from We Are Change on with us for this hour.
[00:00:16.032 --> 00:00:26.995]  Pentagon will buy more satellites to do more spying, Associated Press, and their main new job will be tying the satellites in to the local police departments.
[00:00:28.086 --> 00:00:29.710]  The local departments are being federalized.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:40.844]  And through these FEMA centers, I read about that in 98, and they've now done it, and they track you in real time with your cell phone as a locator beacon off GPS triangulation with the cell towers.
[00:00:42.485 --> 00:00:45.546]  They also dial in listen live time.
[00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.587]  The police are now being upgraded to that in many areas.
[00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:53.710]  They also follow the license plate scanning that tracks everyone where you're at at all times, all part of being a slave.
[00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.051]  And you're debating whether they listen to your phones or not.
[00:00:57.411 --> 00:00:58.592]  How ridiculous!
[00:00:59.372 --> 00:01:03.093]  Google says they're using the cameras and microphones built into the computers that listen to you now.
[00:01:03.634 --> 00:01:04.854]  NSA's dialed in right now.
[00:01:04.894 --> 00:01:06.014]  They're watching me on the camera.
[00:01:06.375 --> 00:01:08.435]  I mean, if they want to pull up their computer program, they can.
[00:01:09.256 --> 00:01:09.636]  Look at me.
[00:01:09.836 --> 00:01:11.656]  Say hi to the pieces of filth over there.
[00:01:12.577 --> 00:01:16.238]  All mainly shaved head mental patients who think they're patriots and conservatives.
[00:01:16.498 --> 00:01:17.579]  You're going to find out real soon.
[00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:18.559]  Your whole family's bankrupt.
[00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.040]  It's all your fault, too, scum, so enjoy your masters.
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:33.085]  And they are now, as we told you ten years ago, in Australia and England and places, harassing their populations with their country's spy satellites, which are really ours that they lease time from.
[00:01:33.965 --> 00:01:34.986]  Did you build a barn?
[00:01:35.046 --> 00:01:36.286]  Did you mow that yard?
[00:01:36.306 --> 00:01:37.607]  Did you cut a tree?
[00:01:38.207 --> 00:01:39.628]  Everything's micromanaged.
[00:01:40.068 --> 00:01:43.970]  They're now saying that they're going to micromanage with the new environmental police
[00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.451]  They're going to live-time launch more satellites that will live-time watch you.
[00:01:48.931 --> 00:01:51.552]  They'll even pick you up spanking your child in the backyard.
[00:01:51.572 --> 00:01:53.632]  They'll try to run out on the street.
[00:01:53.652 --> 00:01:58.454]  You're going to be watched live-time by the local departments with the spy satellites run by the Defense Department.
[00:01:59.654 --> 00:02:02.515]  It's already happening, but they're just announcing it to the slaves.
[00:02:03.831 --> 00:02:04.952]  Let's go to Anthony Yasha.
[00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:13.378]  He's done a lot of great work, even for me, in affiliate relations up in Minnesota and with We Are Change Minnesota.
[00:02:13.598 --> 00:02:15.839]  They've gone and interviewed Jesse Ventura.
[00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:17.641]  About three minutes of an interview they did.
[00:02:17.661 --> 00:02:19.802]  I sat down with him just a few weeks ago.
[00:02:19.822 --> 00:02:24.906]  I was in the extras of the new film that's coming out, Truth Rising.
[00:02:25.888 --> 00:02:35.975]  So I thought we would recognize some of these people, and in a few minutes we're going to have Brian Peterson, We Are Change Minnesota, also on, Anthony Yasha.
[00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:41.499]  We are going to have Nathan Moulton, We Are Change Calgary coming on.
[00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:43.240]  In fact, let's go ahead and get him lined up now.
[00:02:44.081 --> 00:02:46.562]  And Jonathan Ellenhoff of We Are Change Colorado.
[00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:49.304]  In fact, I meant to get everybody on at one time, John.
[00:02:49.344 --> 00:02:49.945]  Do I have them?
[00:02:50.345 --> 00:02:51.766]  Yeah, everyone's here except for Brian.
[00:02:51.786 --> 00:02:52.407]  He's not coming on.
[00:02:52.567 --> 00:02:53.107]  Okay, great.
[00:02:53.147 --> 00:02:53.788]  Fantastic.
[00:02:55.687 --> 00:02:59.429]  Let us now go ahead and say hi to everybody.
[00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:01.650]  First off, Anthony, we are Change Minnesota.
[00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.511]  I want to congratulate you on the fine work you guys are doing.
[00:03:05.831 --> 00:03:12.814]  Tell us about when We Are Change Minnesota was founded and list some of the successes you guys have had.
[00:03:12.834 --> 00:03:16.135]  Well, hey Alex.
[00:03:16.215 --> 00:03:19.536]  We were founded a little over a year ago actually.
[00:03:19.856 --> 00:03:23.738]  When McCain first came, well it wasn't the first time he ever came to town.
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:52.539]  It was our first event where we actually all got together and went out, and McCain took the picture with us with the 9-11 Truth Now signs, and Katherine Statz, whose sister actually died at the Pentagon, and pretty much that was our first initiation into actually going out and confronting these guys, and since then, I mean, definitely we've gotten Conyers, a lot of our local Senators and Congressmen, Bill Clinton, Karl Rove,
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:04:12.148]  Popped out of his car a couple weeks ago, about a month ago, and took a picture with us with the Investigate 9-11 shirts, and just in the last month, I mean, we got a chance to talk to Donnie Hugh, Dan Rather, Amy Goodman, and just seems to be picking up speed the more we get out.
[00:04:15.103 --> 00:04:17.987]  And now, truth rising, you haven't had a chance to see it yet.
[00:04:18.047 --> 00:04:22.213]  We'll be mailing you guys copies on Saturday with everybody else.
[00:04:23.154 --> 00:04:27.380]  What We Are Change Minnesota did really helped energize things.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.401]  Let's go ahead and bring in
[00:04:29.963 --> 00:04:32.145]  Nathan Moulton, We Are Change Calgary.
[00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:35.608]  He's also titled in with 9-11 Truth up in Calvary.
[00:04:35.628 --> 00:04:53.044]  Nathan Moulton's been prolific with the folks up there handing out thousands of TerraStorms, loose changes, going into malls, Halliburton businesses, banner hangs over highways, but also going into Walmart and saying, attention Walmart shoppers, 9-11's an inside job.
[00:04:53.144 --> 00:04:54.506]  Nathan, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:04:55.305 --> 00:05:04.894]  Thanks for having me, Alex, and I would just like to say that I love your work and it's amazing that what really woke me up to 9-11 was your documentary, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:05:05.554 --> 00:05:11.119]  And now, from the actions that I have taken to spread the truth, I'm in one of your films and I'm truly honored by that.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.761]  Well, thank you.
[00:05:12.981 --> 00:05:19.407]  Take a few minutes to talk about how you got involved in 9-11 Truth and what that saga's been like and about what's happening up in Calgary.
[00:05:20.675 --> 00:05:47.684]  I just started looking into the events and it became clear to me that I was an inside job and I started going out to spread the truth and we used a small little digital camera that just took little video clips and me and a friend went out with a bullhorn and we would walk down a mall or go into a gym and bullhorn 9-11 Truth and then we made the video for your Push the Truth video competition which we came in second place
[00:05:48.525 --> 00:05:53.813]  And after I made a few videos, people in Calgary started contacting me and the group here was formed.
[00:05:55.703 --> 00:05:57.825]  Now, I mean, you guys never toot your own horns.
[00:05:58.566 --> 00:06:03.450]  You've had film showings, you've confronted all former prime ministers, leaders.
[00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.594]  I mean, you have been very prolific and there's other 9-11 groups doing it as well.
[00:06:07.634 --> 00:06:20.525]  And again, what's exciting is 9-11 Truth, We Are Change, other groups are getting really aggressive and taking over media events peacefully and making international news every day it's happening with the different We Are Change chapters alone.
[00:06:20.586 --> 00:06:21.666]  Imagine if Americans
[00:06:22.287 --> 00:06:32.151]  period on open borders, or on the dollar devaluation, or on the war did this tactic, the establishment won't be able to go anywhere and have their little photo ops.
[00:06:32.191 --> 00:06:38.413]  Can you speak to how important that is, and jump in any time Anthony, and then we're about to also bring in Jonathan Ellenhoff.
[00:06:38.693 --> 00:06:39.794]  We are Change Colorado.
[00:06:40.902 --> 00:07:08.725]  Yeah, I think the confrontations are definitely important, and I think a lot of people know that 9-11 was an inside job, but aren't taking action like a lot of the truth groups are, and I think that Truth Rising is going to be a very important film in the sense that it's going to show people how energizing and how exciting it is to get out there and to take action, and some of the people that are maybe halfway there will go full force just because of this new film.
[00:07:10.791 --> 00:07:11.472]  I agree with you.
[00:07:11.492 --> 00:07:25.804]  But I mean, run through some of the things, because getting sent all these hundreds of tapes from all over the country and the world, I mean, it becomes staggering even for me, who's focused on this all the time, to put it all in perspective, just how much you've done there in Calgary.
[00:07:26.244 --> 00:07:30.448]  Tell me about some of the other folks on the team and some of the things you've done.
[00:07:31.724 --> 00:07:37.946]  Yeah, well, like you said, we had a screening of Endgame in Calgary a few months ago, and it went really well.
[00:07:38.006 --> 00:07:47.610]  The theater was full, and the reaction to the film was great, and we will definitely be having a screening here of Truth Rising when it comes out.
[00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:48.730]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:08:04.668 --> 00:08:28.010]  About showing people this information and getting them to take action and what I try to do is put a unique spin on it so people will be interested in looking into it and when we go out and hand out free DVDs we get a lot of turn downs but when we put a unique spin on it, like dress up like Santa Claus or whatever, we got rid of 200 DVDs in less than 30 minutes.
[00:08:31.431 --> 00:08:32.571]  Man, that's exciting.
[00:08:33.192 --> 00:08:35.592]  Let's go ahead and bring in Jonathan Elinoff.
[00:08:35.632 --> 00:08:37.173]  We are Change Colorado.
[00:08:37.213 --> 00:08:43.055]  That's particularly important this year because we've got the DNC coming in and ABC News is reporting.
[00:08:43.575 --> 00:08:50.317]  The protesters, anybody that doesn't love the pro-war, pro-world government, pro-destruction of our U.S.
[00:08:50.357 --> 00:08:57.219]  sovereignty, Democrats, the other side of the New World Order wing, you're going to be in a big caged-in free speech zone, aren't you?
[00:08:57.239 --> 00:08:59.760]  I thought the Democrats were against that and were so liberal.
[00:09:01.104 --> 00:09:01.625]  That's right.
[00:09:02.786 --> 00:09:03.647]  We're at Change Colorado.
[00:09:03.667 --> 00:09:05.309]  We're doing an excellent job out here.
[00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:09.435]  We've been tracking what's going on to build up for the DNC.
[00:09:09.495 --> 00:09:16.364]  We just recently tracked the black helicopters, the urban warfare drills, biowarfare drills, and the pandemic drills.
[00:09:17.486 --> 00:09:20.208]  I just released an article today on TruthAlliance.net.
[00:09:20.328 --> 00:09:22.389]  Hopefully we can get it out to the people.
[00:09:23.809 --> 00:09:29.552]  We've found yet another group planning violence at the DNC that actually go to their website.
[00:09:29.612 --> 00:09:33.795]  This new group is actually completely open about their, they call themselves anarchists.
[00:09:33.955 --> 00:09:35.876]  Guaranteed it's led by cops.
[00:09:36.156 --> 00:09:36.996]  Listen folks.
[00:09:37.376 --> 00:09:38.617]  The whole thing is disgusting.
[00:09:38.737 --> 00:09:39.798]  Well, I mean, tell us about it.
[00:09:39.818 --> 00:09:45.921]  They've been caught, Mainstream England, the cops staging riots to stop protesters when Bush was there a week ago.
[00:09:46.341 --> 00:09:50.803]  They have been caught in Canada, in Ottawa, red-handed and had to admit it.
[00:09:51.283 --> 00:09:52.184]  And they're just criminals.
[00:09:52.204 --> 00:09:57.306]  They just think it's good to go out and beat people up so the cops can attack the women and children in strollers.
[00:09:57.606 --> 00:09:57.967]  Go ahead.
[00:09:58.827 --> 00:09:59.287]  Exactly.
[00:10:01.557 --> 00:10:16.090]  You know, the articles I wrote about some of the groups here in Denver really hurt a lot of the movement that was planning violence, and a lot of the members of some of those groups broke away, and actually we destroyed one group entirely.
[00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:24.518]  They broke away, came out and claimed transparency and peace, and there's a new group called Alliance for Real Democracy, and they're claiming peace in this.
[00:10:25.239 --> 00:10:27.661]  But they've banned We Are Change from joining them.
[00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:30.943]  And we went to one of their meetings to ask them, you know, what's the reason?
[00:10:30.963 --> 00:10:34.285]  They said, well, you guys caused us to change our image and do all this work.
[00:10:34.345 --> 00:10:36.386]  And I said, well, isn't that a good thing?
[00:10:36.426 --> 00:10:39.988]  And they said, well, we're progressive radicals and you guys are on the right.
[00:10:40.488 --> 00:10:42.870]  And we said, we're not on the right or the left, man.
[00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:45.331]  We're trying to break the paradigm.
[00:10:45.492 --> 00:10:48.974]  So we immediately, you know, started waking them up.
[00:10:49.014 --> 00:10:50.555]  And then we started talking to people around there.
[00:10:50.575 --> 00:10:54.257]  And there's a group called Unconventional Action that's running this group.
[00:10:54.893 --> 00:10:58.418]  And just like before, Alex, unconventionalaction.org.
[00:10:58.438 --> 00:10:59.860]  It's in the article on truthalliance.net.
[00:11:00.885 --> 00:11:01.726]  Right on their website.
[00:11:01.766 --> 00:11:02.707]  They call for violence.
[00:11:02.747 --> 00:11:04.168]  They call for property destruction.
[00:11:04.188 --> 00:11:05.149]  They're open about it.
[00:11:05.729 --> 00:11:06.910]  Well, that's got to happen.
[00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:15.137]  The cops have got to run those ops to discredit the First Amendment in America, to make sure that that makes the Democrats then look like the good guys.
[00:11:15.617 --> 00:11:17.158]  You've got to demonize the people.
[00:11:17.639 --> 00:11:20.641]  They're so close to bringing the country down and getting what they want.
[00:11:21.442 --> 00:11:23.243]  And they've just got to destroy freedom.
[00:11:23.323 --> 00:11:24.564]  So that's their number one goal.
[00:11:25.365 --> 00:11:28.728]  We are change, Minnesota, Colorado, Canada.
[00:11:28.748 --> 00:11:29.249]  Stay with us.
[00:11:29.889 --> 00:11:42.561]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:11:43.021 --> 00:11:53.705]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:11:54.085 --> 00:11:57.246]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:11:57.486 --> 00:12:04.989]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.
[00:12:05.389 --> 00:12:10.031]  Secure your copy of Loose Change Final Cut today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:12:10.791 --> 00:12:20.600]  While you're visiting the online video store, be sure to check out the huge discounts on films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, America, Freedom to Fascism, and hundreds of other titles.
[00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:23.282]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[00:12:23.642 --> 00:12:28.967]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:33.601]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:12:34.021 --> 00:12:39.445]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:12:39.906 --> 00:12:40.987]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:12:41.007 --> 00:12:45.010]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:59.056]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:12:59.517 --> 00:13:04.819]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:13:05.119 --> 00:13:10.942]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[00:13:11.762 --> 00:13:13.103]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:13:13.243 --> 00:13:17.807]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[00:13:18.227 --> 00:13:18.827]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:13:18.847 --> 00:13:21.049]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[00:13:21.069 --> 00:13:21.129]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:13:29.952 --> 00:13:31.994]  The superfood for you and your family.
[00:13:32.374 --> 00:13:35.657]  Hemp has nutritional values that far exceed any known plant.
[00:13:36.138 --> 00:13:36.398]  Hemp.
[00:13:36.818 --> 00:13:39.581]  Used for food, clothing, and shelter since time began.
[00:13:39.921 --> 00:13:40.202]  Hemp.
[00:13:40.562 --> 00:13:46.988]  This God-given food source is controlled by your government, making it not legal to grow for American people and farmers, but legal to import.
[00:13:47.348 --> 00:13:50.611]  Our Founding Fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.
[00:13:50.891 --> 00:13:54.734]  The protein powder, seeds, and oil are available through hempusa.org.
[00:13:55.074 --> 00:13:59.398]  Recommended daily intake of this food source will allow the body to heal itself from many ailments.
[00:13:59.758 --> 00:14:06.163]  Loaded with potassium, magnesium, calcium, essential fatty acids, amino acids, and nutrients not available in other plants.
[00:14:06.483 --> 00:14:10.766]  Hemp can be stored with a long shelf life as a life-sustaining food source for you and your family.
[00:14:11.006 --> 00:14:12.868]  Could this be the government's best-kept secret?
[00:14:13.108 --> 00:14:19.352]  Call today at 908-691-2608 and see what the powder, seeds, and oil can do for you.
[00:14:19.712 --> 00:14:23.035]  Learn, help, shop at hempusa.org.
[00:14:23.195 --> 00:14:24.276]  We do not charge for shipping.
[00:14:24.336 --> 00:14:25.497]  That's 908-691-2608 or go to hempusa.org today.
[00:14:30.908 --> 00:14:35.109]  Would you like to know how you can use water as fuel and laugh at the rising price of gas?
[00:14:35.309 --> 00:14:37.290]  Then keep listening for a very special offer.
[00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:42.612]  GasFreedom.info has the information you need to learn about a simple technology you can have right now.
[00:14:42.832 --> 00:14:47.033]  GasFreedom is a do-it-yourself, affordable, practical, free energy device.
[00:14:47.293 --> 00:14:51.675]  It uses electricity from your car's battery to separate water into a gas called HHO.
[00:14:52.915 --> 00:14:53.435]  I think so.
[00:15:08.302 --> 00:15:08.722]  I think so.
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:42.105]  Of course, the cops that dress up like anarchists and lead little 10-man, 20-man squads of Ford Foundation and other foundation, oil company foundation, literally,
[00:15:59.721 --> 00:16:00.141]  Groups.
[00:16:01.763 --> 00:16:02.884]  You ever heard of NPR?
[00:16:03.004 --> 00:16:04.045]  It's all oil companies.
[00:16:04.385 --> 00:16:05.726]  Q Foundation, the rest of it.
[00:16:06.487 --> 00:16:08.228]  Q Charitable Trust, that's Exxon Mobil.
[00:16:11.932 --> 00:16:14.474]  They dress up and they think these protests are bad.
[00:16:14.494 --> 00:16:22.821]  They're saying to Americans, we're going to go out and beat the cops up in staged fights so we can... I got video of them in Portland.
[00:16:23.501 --> 00:16:24.883]  Peaceful crowd doing nothing.
[00:16:25.563 --> 00:16:26.944]  Open fire with rubber bullets.
[00:16:27.685 --> 00:16:32.287]  Walk right over to baby carriages and spray babies and say, shut the F up, lady!
[00:16:32.667 --> 00:16:35.408]  Don't bring an effing baby to a protest!
[00:16:35.808 --> 00:16:44.171]  Just a cop in a Darth Vader outfit, and I'm supposed to lick his boots, and oh, he's a good officer, and oh, I love him so much!
[00:16:44.691 --> 00:16:45.851]  We got all these great YouTubers.
[00:16:46.051 --> 00:16:48.812]  Grab me talking about this right now and go get the video of that guy doing it.
[00:16:48.832 --> 00:16:49.312]  Show people.
[00:16:50.213 --> 00:16:52.093]  You know, I'm just, I've had enough!
[00:16:52.654 --> 00:16:53.194]  You understand?
[00:16:53.254 --> 00:16:53.854]  I'm done!
[00:16:54.454 --> 00:16:56.435]  The government's criminal, it's raping the country!
[00:16:57.409 --> 00:17:05.236]  And I want to bring in the other We Are Change guys to comment on this, but yeah, We Are Change isn't just, and the truth groups, and activists, and whatever group you're in.
[00:17:05.716 --> 00:17:07.198]  You're here to fight the New World Order.
[00:17:07.638 --> 00:17:10.601]  Liberals, conservatives, whatever paradigm they're carrying out.
[00:17:11.381 --> 00:17:16.166]  Liberals carry out one part of the attack on liberty, and the Republicans carry out the other attack, that's the pincer attack.
[00:17:19.352 --> 00:17:27.136]  There is We Are Change Colorado, and it was on these people's websites, and it turned out the people heading them up were connected to the government and other ops in the past.
[00:17:28.236 --> 00:17:46.665]  Going back to Jonathan Elinoff, and then Nathan Moulton of Canada, We Are Change, and Anthony, jump in any time, guys, to comment on this, but this is an example of what you're doing, not just with 9-11 Truth, but this overall attack on every liberty we've got.
[00:17:48.004 --> 00:17:49.025]  Yeah, Alex.
[00:17:49.665 --> 00:17:57.951]  You know, this DNC is going to be... I've got people in our group that are preparing to leave town.
[00:17:57.971 --> 00:18:00.113]  They're so worried about violence.
[00:18:01.254 --> 00:18:03.335]  We tracked these urban warfare drills.
[00:18:03.375 --> 00:18:06.197]  I don't know if you know much about what's been going on here.
[00:18:07.518 --> 00:18:14.003]  But the Denver Office of Emergency Management is planning for mass evacuations of the city during the week for the DNC.
[00:18:14.881 --> 00:18:17.622]  Now they did not communicate if there's any intelligence of a threat.
[00:18:17.662 --> 00:18:20.503]  They haven't said, you know, some are saying maybe there's a false flag.
[00:18:21.023 --> 00:18:29.185]  Now you know Nixon wanted to bomb his own Republican convention, this is even on Frontline now, and blame it on anti-war people.
[00:18:29.725 --> 00:18:31.666]  And of course that's not declassified, but go ahead.
[00:18:32.406 --> 00:18:34.586]  You got it, you're hitting right on target.
[00:18:34.646 --> 00:18:40.668]  We have, I've now shown four groups publicly talking about not just property destruction but violence.
[00:18:42.478 --> 00:18:48.163]  Massive, agitated protests that include demands beyond anything that's, I mean, radical.
[00:18:48.243 --> 00:18:49.644]  And again, I want to be clear here.
[00:18:50.064 --> 00:18:51.585]  This is what We Are Change is doing.
[00:18:52.286 --> 00:18:53.447]  And other 9-11 truth groups.
[00:18:53.507 --> 00:18:56.049]  We're going out and exposing provocateur actions.
[00:18:56.389 --> 00:19:00.693]  We're preemptively preempting the secret police from staging events.
[00:19:02.294 --> 00:19:05.937]  Jump in here and comment on how important this is, Nathan and Anthony.
[00:19:07.833 --> 00:19:20.695]  Yeah, it's absolutely important, and up here in Canada, you've got all these neocons talking about how Canada is the only country that hasn't been hit by a major terrorist attack, and it's only a matter of time before it happens.
[00:19:20.715 --> 00:19:28.177]  I mean, I have police on tape saying the same thing, and saying that we need more surveillance cameras to fix the problem.
[00:19:31.077 --> 00:19:32.037]  It's just incredible.
[00:19:33.538 --> 00:19:34.818]  Any comments on that, Anthony?
[00:19:34.858 --> 00:19:35.858]  We are Change Minnesota.
[00:19:38.427 --> 00:19:42.429]  Because Anthony, you've got the RNC coming up there.
[00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:51.595]  Yeah, the RNC really hasn't been making too much news either lately and we've kind of been worried about
[00:19:52.202 --> 00:19:59.104]  Maybe what's going to happen up here and stuff, and we were actually at an event this last week, which the St.
[00:19:59.164 --> 00:20:20.492]  Paul Chief of Police, that actually, I mean, he's going to be running a lot of the stuff during the RNC, where we, he kind of caught us off guard, where he actually was telling the local Fox reporter here that if he wanted to get real news or real coverage of what's going on in the world, that he needed to pay attention to weird change, and we haven't got a chance to follow up with him, but we're
[00:20:22.153 --> 00:20:25.395]  Very glad, and we're hoping that he's possibly a listener to your show.
[00:20:25.955 --> 00:20:26.536]  What happened?
[00:20:26.556 --> 00:20:30.118]  You met with a police chief and he said go to We Are Change for the real info?
[00:20:30.758 --> 00:20:36.582]  We were taught we were going to have an interview with a Fox 9 reporter here.
[00:20:37.322 --> 00:20:40.584]  He was finishing up an interview with the police chief, St.
[00:20:40.604 --> 00:20:49.390]  Paul police chief, and as he was finished wrapping up his interview with Fox, he told the reporter that if he wanted to get real news that he needed to watch We Are Change.
[00:20:50.177 --> 00:20:56.340]  And the guy, I mean, you could tell he didn't like hearing that, but... My God, this means, see, you got some good cops!
[00:20:56.881 --> 00:20:59.282]  We need to call the Minneapolis, I mean, St.
[00:20:59.322 --> 00:21:02.284]  Paul, Minnesota Police Chief and ask him what's going on.
[00:21:02.324 --> 00:21:09.127]  There are some good cops who do care about the country, and, uh, but he, he, I mean, either they're with us or they're with the terrorists.
[00:21:09.167 --> 00:21:10.548]  And when I say that, I'm serious.
[00:21:10.928 --> 00:21:12.049]  That's not a joke, folks.
[00:21:12.729 --> 00:21:15.110]  I mean, the police need to figure out this isn't a joke.
[00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:15.971]  This is the real deal.
[00:21:19.767 --> 00:21:20.688]  We're on the march.
[00:21:21.168 --> 00:21:22.789]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:26.472]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:29.735 --> 00:21:31.857]  Hey Bonnie, no more pickpocketing for us.
[00:21:32.137 --> 00:21:36.300]  I have an easier way we can steal people's credit cards without them even knowing they've been robbed.
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:37.561]  How so, Clyde?
[00:21:37.741 --> 00:21:40.503]  I have this RFID reader I picked up on the internet.
[00:21:40.684 --> 00:21:45.347]  Just by waving it near you, I can skim your credit card information while your cards are still in your purse.
[00:21:45.547 --> 00:21:46.048]  Just watch.
[00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:48.611]  Hey look, that's my info on the screen.
[00:21:48.752 --> 00:21:49.992]  You gotta be kidding me.
[00:21:50.233 --> 00:21:50.473]  Nope.
[00:21:50.613 --> 00:21:54.676]  With 50 million credit cards with hidden RFID chips, I figure we'll make a fortune.
[00:21:54.916 --> 00:21:57.138]  As long as people don't hear about Identity Stronghold.
[00:21:57.338 --> 00:21:57.678]  Why?
[00:21:57.878 --> 00:21:59.659]  What's Identity Stronghold?
[00:21:59.839 --> 00:22:01.180]  They make the Secure Sleeve.
[00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:04.923]  When people keep their credit cards in the shielded Secure Sleeve, I can't read them.
[00:22:04.963 --> 00:22:07.925]  Do a lot of people already know about the Secure Sleeve?
[00:22:08.045 --> 00:22:08.685]  No way.
[00:22:08.906 --> 00:22:12.288]  Most people don't realize they even have chips in their credit cards and passports.
[00:22:12.448 --> 00:22:15.070]  Clyde, we should get some of those Secure Sleeves.
[00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:16.110]  I already got some.
[00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:17.992]  I also got some to fit our passports.
[00:22:18.232 --> 00:22:22.935]  Identity Stronghold has Secure Sleeves for sale right on the internet at IDStronghold.com.
[00:22:23.215 --> 00:22:24.836]  IDStronghold.com?

[00:23:51.956 --> 00:23:55.657]  The total cost for this massive package of information is only $10.
[00:23:55.697 --> 00:24:00.519]  $15 for UPS ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[00:24:01.179 --> 00:24:03.200]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.721]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:24:05.741 --> 00:24:07.862]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:24:08.022 --> 00:24:09.543]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:24:09.563 --> 00:24:11.203]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:24:11.263 --> 00:24:14.144]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:24:14.184 --> 00:24:17.986]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:37.316]  I'm gonna be honest with you out there.
[00:24:37.416 --> 00:24:41.559]  If I sound bitter and mean and upset, I am.
[00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:55.968]  I mean, I only wish FBI people, military people, police, school teachers, black people, white people, Hispanics... I got my head screwed on straight.
[00:24:57.412 --> 00:24:59.854]  In that I know that you're doing well means I'm going to do well.
[00:25:00.775 --> 00:25:02.396]  I'm not an envious, jealous person.
[00:25:04.097 --> 00:25:06.198]  I am a very open, loving, good person.
[00:25:06.238 --> 00:25:08.160]  I'm also very primitive.
[00:25:09.181 --> 00:25:09.941]  I am vicious.
[00:25:10.862 --> 00:25:12.123]  At least I've been in my past.
[00:25:14.484 --> 00:25:17.987]  I mean, I literally, so many people have these personalities where they're one way or the other.
[00:25:18.007 --> 00:25:21.690]  I mean, I've got the whole ball game and in extremes.
[00:25:23.297 --> 00:25:27.581]  I know a lot of you got more to love and more passion than I got.
[00:25:29.102 --> 00:25:31.063]  But, I mean, I only want what's good for people.
[00:25:31.123 --> 00:25:33.105]  And I know the vaccines are hurting people.
[00:25:33.265 --> 00:25:35.127]  I know we're losing our liberties and freedoms.
[00:25:35.287 --> 00:25:39.030]  I know criminals run the government at the highest levels and stage the attacks.
[00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:39.690]  I don't think.
[00:25:39.811 --> 00:25:40.211]  I know.
[00:25:42.753 --> 00:25:47.077]  And I know for new listeners this also sounds like a really extreme
[00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:59.623]  Crazy show, but compared to What's Your Favorite Color and all the bull you hear on regular talk radio, I mean, look, folks, you understand the dollar has already been devalued by 60 plus percent.
[00:26:00.043 --> 00:26:05.009]  You understand mainstream news is talking and major governments are talking about a depression.
[00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:06.791]  That isn't cute.
[00:26:07.272 --> 00:26:08.053]  I am mad!
[00:26:09.445 --> 00:26:25.816]  But I'll tell you this, I thank God every day that I get to associate with people like Anthony and the other folks we've got on the line, Mr. Moulton doing a fabulous job, Jonathan Ellenhoff, and all the 9-11 truth groups and all the 9-11 bloggers.
[00:26:28.598 --> 00:26:42.063]  The Truth Action folks, and Cosmo, and then all the architects and engineers and whistleblowers, and Willie Nelson and Jesse Ventura, and German defense minister, and a highly respected Italian president.
[00:26:42.643 --> 00:26:44.104]  I mean, there's just all these people.
[00:26:45.745 --> 00:26:46.685]  I mean, this is history.
[00:26:47.925 --> 00:26:49.166]  And it's not fun.
[00:26:49.186 --> 00:26:51.327]  People are like, how dare you say that about your government?
[00:26:51.687 --> 00:26:56.669]  Like, it's fun to come on the air day one and say it's an inside job, because you know it is.
[00:26:57.597 --> 00:27:00.899]  And to lose 30% of your radio stations that day.
[00:27:01.379 --> 00:27:11.183]  And to have people hating you and threatening you and, you know, have people, other patriots down at the TV station scream at me in the hall and say, I agree with you on everything else, but you better back off on this.
[00:27:11.203 --> 00:27:14.605]  I mean, you think it's fun to thumb my nose at the New World Order?
[00:27:14.625 --> 00:27:16.065]  You think it's fun with these killers?
[00:27:16.425 --> 00:27:17.886]  I believe everything I say about them.
[00:27:17.966 --> 00:27:18.767]  I know they do it.
[00:27:19.867 --> 00:27:21.128]  This isn't a game for me.
[00:27:21.168 --> 00:27:22.728]  It isn't a game for We Are Change.
[00:27:22.748 --> 00:27:23.949]  It isn't a game for any of us.
[00:27:25.162 --> 00:27:27.283]  This isn't about being the patriot celebrities.
[00:27:27.883 --> 00:27:29.304]  This is war.
[00:27:31.025 --> 00:27:34.807]  And they've got most of the good people neutralized, kind of on the sidelines.
[00:27:34.847 --> 00:27:35.887]  They don't trust anybody.
[00:27:37.608 --> 00:27:47.673]  And then you've got some people serving the evil, and you've got a lot of people serving evil because they know it's evil and they've decided through fear, not just through wanting power, to go ahead and kiss up to the dark side.
[00:27:48.714 --> 00:27:49.034]  Not me.
[00:27:50.401 --> 00:27:52.082]  You know, people think there's only fight or flight.
[00:27:52.442 --> 00:27:55.124]  Fight, flight, hidings type of flight.
[00:27:55.604 --> 00:27:58.125]  But fighting is really the ultimate form of flight.
[00:27:59.146 --> 00:28:13.534]  I mean, I remember the times in my life where three or four big guys, and this is how I grew up in Dallas, thank God Austin didn't like this, but I grew up, a lot of rough stuff, people beat the hell out of each other all the time for no reason, there was more crime there, and I happened to see a lot of rough stuff, and I remember, you know,
[00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:24.305]  The times when I really could just go all the way with somebody, I mean just almost unlimited strength, was when I had my back up against a wall.
[00:28:24.425 --> 00:28:25.486]  And they were big guys.
[00:28:25.586 --> 00:28:32.390]  And every time that happened, people went to the hospital and lost IQ points for life or worse.
[00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:35.531]  And it's the same thing we face with this New World Order.
[00:28:35.591 --> 00:28:36.772]  We don't have a choice.
[00:28:37.713 --> 00:28:43.436]  But the few times I got in a fight with somebody and it was 50-50 whose fault it was,
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.841]  Is the times I got my ass kicked.
[00:28:46.921 --> 00:28:47.681]  Excuse the French.
[00:28:50.762 --> 00:28:53.283]  Because you gotta be a man on the right, folks.
[00:28:53.823 --> 00:28:56.303]  Just like that Texas Ranger saying, a picture I got in here.
[00:28:56.323 --> 00:29:02.565]  A man in the wrong can't stand up against a man on the right who keeps on a coming.
[00:29:03.986 --> 00:29:05.346]  And that is the difference here.
[00:29:06.867 --> 00:29:13.989]  And we are dedicated, we are committed to this because we know we don't have a choice.
[00:29:17.028 --> 00:29:29.816]  And I just wish I could impart to most people in our movement, not most the listeners or your local activists, but the people who run a lot of other sites and news things, so much of it is just backstabbing rottenness.
[00:29:29.856 --> 00:29:40.343]  If you go to a website and they're spending all day fighting with each other, and all day saying who the best is, and all day criticizing other people, or this is disinfo, that's disinfo, folks, that's disinfo, that's government operations.
[00:29:41.616 --> 00:29:43.938]  But some often it's not even government operations.
[00:29:43.958 --> 00:29:46.160]  I have to admit it's just that we're a rotten society.
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:53.427]  Just because people on the New World Order side are bad, doesn't mean that people who've woken up and don't like the New World Order doesn't mean they're not rotten either.
[00:29:53.467 --> 00:29:56.229]  I mean, we really, and you know, I'm rotten to a certain extent.
[00:29:56.269 --> 00:29:57.590]  I get really nasty and angry.
[00:29:57.931 --> 00:29:59.412]  I'm in a disgusted mood right now.
[00:29:59.452 --> 00:30:00.413]  You'd think I'd be happy.
[00:30:00.713 --> 00:30:01.994]  Gold's exploding right now.
[00:30:02.014 --> 00:30:03.075]  Oh, I've been proven right again.
[00:30:03.736 --> 00:30:05.658]  No, I'm very upset right now!
[00:30:08.737 --> 00:30:21.730]  It's kind of like a kid's out in the street and a Mack truck's coming and it's 500 yards away, going 80 miles an hour, and it's going to be here in about 30 seconds, 25 seconds, however long it takes, and you're telling the little kid, get out of the street.
[00:30:22.311 --> 00:30:22.911]  Get out of the street.
[00:30:22.931 --> 00:30:24.413]  You're trying to drag them out of the street now.
[00:30:24.473 --> 00:30:25.414]  It's 10 seconds away.
[00:30:25.594 --> 00:30:26.455]  And they're fighting you.
[00:30:27.536 --> 00:30:29.297]  And would you be mad at the 5-year-old?
[00:30:29.358 --> 00:30:30.499]  You're absolutely right.
[00:30:30.999 --> 00:30:32.561]  You grab the kid by the arm, they bite you.
[00:30:35.097 --> 00:30:37.078]  You pick them up in your arms, they bite your shoulder.
[00:30:37.318 --> 00:30:39.558]  You're trying to get them out of the street so the truck doesn't hit them.
[00:30:41.319 --> 00:30:44.139]  And I mean, I'm sitting here watching, and I mean, it's like 500 yards away now!
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.080]  You think the economy's bad now?
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:47.940]  You've seen nothing.
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:50.961]  And I want to get your comments, We Are Change, all of you, on that.
[00:30:51.041 --> 00:30:57.683]  First off, Jonathan Ellenhoff, We Are Change Colorado, just all of this impending meltdown, it's already here, but
[00:30:59.167 --> 00:31:00.107]  It could get so much worse.
[00:31:00.147 --> 00:31:00.967]  It looks like it is.
[00:31:02.668 --> 00:31:04.768]  It's more important than ever to have you guys out there.
[00:31:06.128 --> 00:31:07.329]  We're prepped.
[00:31:07.389 --> 00:31:09.509]  We have contingency plans.
[00:31:09.769 --> 00:31:16.031]  We just hit a 400-member mark a couple weeks ago at We Are Change Colorado's mailing list.
[00:31:16.451 --> 00:31:18.831]  We have about 60 dedicated, direct activists.
[00:31:18.851 --> 00:31:22.512]  We've got a We Are Change Pueblo that's starting and a We Are Change Colorado Springs.
[00:31:24.452 --> 00:31:26.453]  We have a Boulder group that's already been started.
[00:31:26.493 --> 00:31:27.553]  They're not as visible yet.
[00:31:28.441 --> 00:31:31.187]  And I can tell you right now, we've got contingencies for you name it.
[00:31:31.248 --> 00:31:34.375]  We're ready for... We've been waking people up now for a year.
[00:31:35.117 --> 00:31:37.960]  And we hand out 800 DVDs a week without fail.
[00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:40.382]  I'm just glad to know the people in this movement.
[00:31:40.402 --> 00:31:41.623]  I feel like I've met my brothers.
[00:31:41.903 --> 00:31:50.351]  And let's not forget, from Colorado to New York to Canada, the cops walk up and say, don't hand videos out on the street corner.
[00:31:50.811 --> 00:31:51.892]  Don't talk to people.
[00:31:51.953 --> 00:31:55.115]  You've got to have a permit to talk to people and have five of you standing here.
[00:31:55.656 --> 00:31:57.418]  By the way, we're going to go ahead and arrest you.
[00:31:57.438 --> 00:31:58.679]  We're going to go ahead and cite you.
[00:31:59.219 --> 00:32:01.060]  Alex, I don't know if you got a chance to see.
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:02.020]  WeAreChangedColorado.org.
[00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:03.181]  It should still be up there.
[00:32:03.201 --> 00:32:05.742]  I went through the archived videos and I remembered this.
[00:32:05.762 --> 00:32:07.803]  We went through and found it.
[00:32:07.823 --> 00:32:11.785]  We were on 16th Street Mall where one of our members, Rob, got arrested for handing out DVDs.
[00:32:29.071 --> 00:32:33.912]  And some local security guard had called the cops on us and said that handing out DVDs was illegal.
[00:32:33.932 --> 00:32:35.812]  This was three and a half, four months ago.
[00:32:36.673 --> 00:32:37.433]  Cops showed up.
[00:32:38.093 --> 00:32:42.054]  We had the cop on camera, and he said it was protected by the First Amendment rights.
[00:32:42.074 --> 00:32:44.654]  It's at the same exact location where Rob got arrested.
[00:32:45.014 --> 00:32:49.635]  I posted both videos for everyone to see that the police... And that's a good officer, and that's a good officer.
[00:32:50.475 --> 00:32:54.076]  But then the other ones come and stomp on your rights in the middle of downtown.
[00:32:55.570 --> 00:33:01.035]  They've completely lied and they didn't even begin to represent the law.
[00:33:01.316 --> 00:33:03.758]  They had 17 cops that showed up.
[00:33:03.818 --> 00:33:06.761]  It looked like, Alex, it kind of looked like they were trying to provoke something.
[00:33:06.781 --> 00:33:09.824]  Because all 17 cops had a whole bunch of cars, it made a big scene.
[00:33:10.144 --> 00:33:15.049]  They showed up and they had cops standing at all the corners next to all our guys, looking at them, staring them down in the face.
[00:33:15.709 --> 00:33:18.612]  And then they start arresting Rob, and Rob was completely cooperative.
[00:33:21.123 --> 00:33:23.066]  God, that's like a Nazi Germany, man.
[00:33:23.686 --> 00:33:27.190]  Let's go to Nathan Moulton, Moulton Productions.
[00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:28.953]  You can just Google that, all the great stuff he does.
[00:33:28.993 --> 00:33:30.014]  We are Change Calgary.
[00:33:31.155 --> 00:33:33.638]  What have you run into with your police up there?
[00:33:33.658 --> 00:33:36.642]  Have they been a little bit more observant of free speech?
[00:33:37.987 --> 00:33:45.453]  Uh, mainly what happens to us is we get ragged on for filming and in almost every instant that that happens... Hold on!
[00:33:45.513 --> 00:33:48.836]  Filming on the street while they've got surveillance all over you?
[00:33:48.856 --> 00:33:49.256]  Go ahead.
[00:33:49.757 --> 00:33:51.138]  Exactly, exactly.
[00:33:51.158 --> 00:33:58.084]  There'll be a surveillance camera right over their head, basically, and they're telling us that we can't film on a public street.
[00:33:58.124 --> 00:34:02.668]  It's like they don't even know what our rights are, and they're telling us what they think it should be.
[00:34:03.742 --> 00:34:05.163]  I wonder how they get a cop.
[00:34:05.203 --> 00:34:13.566]  I wonder how they get cops in Canada or Texas or anywhere to dress up like anarchists and hit other cops so they can attack old ladies with billy clubs.
[00:34:13.646 --> 00:34:14.367]  I'm sorry.
[00:34:14.387 --> 00:34:15.067]  Go ahead, Moulton.
[00:34:15.827 --> 00:34:18.148]  Yeah, and they're changing everything to black now.
[00:34:18.188 --> 00:34:24.791]  We got black helicopters flying around Calgary and that's just the main police helicopter that's flying around every day.
[00:34:24.871 --> 00:34:27.052]  But there's no doubt they're the bad guys.
[00:34:27.092 --> 00:34:30.913]  They're telling you you can't videotape in America or Canada.
[00:34:31.133 --> 00:34:31.834]  This is Bull.
[00:34:31.874 --> 00:34:32.234]  Go ahead.
[00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:34.501]  Yeah, and it's just crazy.
[00:34:34.561 --> 00:34:42.566]  They're giving tasers to transit police officers, and they got police officers riding the train.
[00:34:42.606 --> 00:34:45.148]  But like you guys said, there are a lot of good officers out there.
[00:34:45.168 --> 00:34:49.751]  We're not saying all cops are bad, but there's just a lot of them that don't know what they're talking about.
[00:34:49.791 --> 00:34:56.115]  What do you say to them when they walk over and say, we're going to have cameras everywhere, but you can't have a camera in Canada, slave.
[00:34:56.135 --> 00:34:57.636]  This is the Soviet Union.
[00:34:57.676 --> 00:34:58.457]  Turn your camera off.
[00:34:59.511 --> 00:35:01.734]  I say I have every right to be filming here.
[00:35:01.814 --> 00:35:07.181]  You can't, you know, look at, you guys got cameras all over the place and you're telling me I can't film right here.
[00:35:07.221 --> 00:35:08.903]  This is supposed to be free Canada.
[00:35:09.443 --> 00:35:12.888]  And it's like Canada is just becoming a hellhole lately.
[00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:16.671]  Try flying in there if you're not a Canadian.
[00:35:16.711 --> 00:35:18.011]  My God, it's unbelievable.
[00:35:18.732 --> 00:35:19.932]  I got a big story about a U.S.
[00:35:19.972 --> 00:35:22.313]  cop beaten, tortured, kept for a long time.
[00:35:22.333 --> 00:35:26.554]  That's from World Net Daily right here, by the Canadian nut jobs.
[00:35:27.155 --> 00:35:34.838]  The Canadian people are great, but your people at the airports, those customs people are like psychopaths.
[00:35:35.398 --> 00:35:36.858]  Screaming, yelling, laughing.
[00:35:37.138 --> 00:35:38.179]  You're going to jail!
[00:35:38.199 --> 00:35:40.119]  You're going to spend years in our jails!
[00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:42.961]  And black uniforms.
[00:35:43.021 --> 00:35:43.541]  I mean, it's just...
[00:35:44.441 --> 00:35:45.242]  Oh, God help us.
[00:35:45.622 --> 00:35:51.866]  I want to take some phone calls here in just a moment, but you chime in, Anthony, from up there in We Are Change Minnesota.
[00:35:52.146 --> 00:35:54.607]  What's happening with police up there other than the St.
[00:35:54.627 --> 00:35:57.329]  Paul Police Chief saying, We Are Change has got the info?
[00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:02.232]  Well, we've definitely, the last couple of months here, turned our focus.
[00:36:02.252 --> 00:36:09.637]  We're definitely trying to get the public more aware, doing our street actions and stuff, but actually taking the time to talk to police.
[00:36:09.877 --> 00:36:13.039]  I mean, John McCain came through about a week and a half ago.
[00:36:13.911 --> 00:36:16.353]  Did two speeches, one in Minneapolis and one in St.
[00:36:16.393 --> 00:36:16.793]  Paul.
[00:36:16.893 --> 00:36:23.218]  That's where we actually talked to the Chief, but between the two events, they probably had no less than 600 cops.
[00:36:23.798 --> 00:36:29.222]  And between the two events, probably no more than 300 people, tops, in the actual offense.
[00:36:29.802 --> 00:36:40.010]  And like I said, we spent most of our time not covering the BS inside, that he was preaching everybody in there, but actually going out and informing the cops and just standing there and talking to them.
[00:36:40.836 --> 00:37:07.635]  They literally did kind of the Imperial March, where they kind of, as soon as his motorcade was going to leave, they walked over and blocked us off of the wall, and a couple of our members just kind of, I don't know, intuition just started humming the Imperial, Imperial March theme song, and you could just, you could just see the look on some of the police's faces, but they just kind of made them stop and think about what they were doing there, and why they're protecting something like this, and
[00:37:09.186 --> 00:37:24.276]  Well, they just act like anybody with a camera, anybody with a protest sign is, oh, oh my God, in America, or England, or Canada, the citizens are talking, they're, oh my God, it's so scary.
[00:37:26.357 --> 00:37:27.137]  Just amazing.
[00:37:27.458 --> 00:37:28.838]  Let's go ahead and take some calls here.
[00:37:29.559 --> 00:37:34.042]  John in Idaho, then JJ, Dave, and Dana, go ahead.
[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:36.982]  Say, some I never hear talked much about.
[00:37:37.042 --> 00:37:48.831]  We got a little group here in Lewiston, Idaho, but I stumbled across this site one day, and somehow I got turned on to it, that a police car was crushed by a jet engine, one of the jet engines that were attached to the plane that hit the South Tower.
[00:37:49.391 --> 00:37:52.293]  So I did a search for jet engine crushers, police car on 9-11.
[00:37:52.814 --> 00:37:56.757]  There's this site, and all these experts are saying, that wasn't an engine from a 767, it's from a 737.
[00:37:56.797 --> 00:37:57.778]  Military guys, aircraft experts, fire...
[00:38:03.229 --> 00:38:05.530]  Yeah, that might be a good point to put in the film.
[00:38:06.151 --> 00:38:06.691]  I'd forgotten.
[00:38:06.751 --> 00:38:08.512]  I remember seeing that once, yeah.
[00:38:08.952 --> 00:38:12.674]  Yeah, all you've got to do is jet engine crushes police car on 9-11 and it pops right up.
[00:38:14.014 --> 00:38:17.296]  And if that in fact is true, the FBI supposedly took that engine.
[00:38:17.336 --> 00:38:18.256]  Nobody's seen it since.
[00:38:18.436 --> 00:38:26.300]  Well, the firefighters and police said they found all three of the black boxes, and then they said they never found them because they don't want you hearing what's on them.
[00:38:26.881 --> 00:38:27.041]  Right.
[00:38:27.081 --> 00:38:30.963]  Well, my point is that if it's true that that was an engine from a 737, that proves cover-up.
[00:38:32.492 --> 00:38:33.673]  And that's what brought down Nixon.
[00:38:33.713 --> 00:38:35.995]  That's what's destroyed a lot of politicians.
[00:38:36.055 --> 00:38:39.137]  That could, you know, be another major smoking gun.
[00:38:39.177 --> 00:38:43.061]  But I'd really like to see people start saying, hey, look, we got proof here that they're lying.
[00:38:43.501 --> 00:38:43.861]  I hear you.
[00:38:43.881 --> 00:38:46.123]  I appreciate your call from Idaho, John.
[00:38:46.523 --> 00:38:48.265]  Yeah, I'll briefly chime in.
[00:38:48.305 --> 00:38:49.306]  I want to take some more calls.
[00:38:50.146 --> 00:38:59.534]  I mean, to see the parabolic, straight-up growth of 9-11 truth and the fact that those that are still in denial are like, well, nobody believes that.
[00:38:59.554 --> 00:39:00.795]  And you can show them polls of 84 percent
[00:39:02.196 --> 00:39:02.957]  Yeah, that's right Alex.
[00:39:03.017 --> 00:39:09.040]  I didn't know if this was on topic anymore or not, but we've got a film coming out for We Are Change Colorado with Corey Rowe and Jason Vermas.
[00:39:29.767 --> 00:39:30.787]  Love to show it to you, Alex.
[00:39:31.027 --> 00:39:35.368]  And we're covering a whole prior knowledge, I wrote and directed it, of 9-11.
[00:39:35.808 --> 00:39:41.190]  A whole angle that I'm trying to get out there, which is... Say that again, you've got a film coming out with who?
[00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:44.630]  I've been working with Corey Rowe and Jason Burmiss.
[00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:47.511]  And I don't know if Jason's talked to you about it at all.
[00:39:47.591 --> 00:39:48.971]  Core Corruption is the name of the film.
[00:39:49.671 --> 00:39:50.972]  And I've been working on it for a year and a half.
[00:39:53.231 --> 00:39:57.652]  It is basically... I cover that 737 engine story in there.
[00:39:57.672 --> 00:39:58.512]  I've covered a lot.
[00:39:59.472 --> 00:40:00.893]  I used micro-barrel stuff.
[00:40:00.913 --> 00:40:01.773]  I used your stuff.
[00:40:01.913 --> 00:40:03.093]  Your site is excellent.
[00:40:03.433 --> 00:40:05.293]  I've always accredited your work.
[00:40:05.313 --> 00:40:06.234]  Oh, that's great.
[00:40:06.554 --> 00:40:07.494]  He told me something about that.
[00:40:07.514 --> 00:40:08.334]  I'd forgotten about it.
[00:40:08.374 --> 00:40:09.814]  I've forgotten so much.
[00:40:09.874 --> 00:40:10.715]  It's amazing.
[00:40:11.015 --> 00:40:12.655]  Are you refreshed on my memory?
[00:40:12.675 --> 00:40:14.595]  Well, hopefully we can get this information out there.
[00:40:15.936 --> 00:40:21.937]  I didn't know if it was still on target for this or not, but Anthony in Minnesota there, we are changing... Is that right?
[00:40:21.977 --> 00:40:22.177]  Yeah.
[00:40:23.942 --> 00:40:33.710]  The RNC welcoming committee, if you get a chance to go to Truthlines.net, we support Alex Jones, always have loved, I mean, we love you, man.
[00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:35.772]  You don't have to preface that every time you say that.
[00:40:35.852 --> 00:40:37.453]  I got you here to plug your website, man.
[00:40:37.853 --> 00:40:38.274]  I don't care.
[00:40:38.314 --> 00:40:38.894]  Well, cool.
[00:40:39.054 --> 00:40:42.677]  I mean, if you ever go to Truthlines.net, those guys are all over the site, you know.
[00:40:42.897 --> 00:40:47.141]  No, no, that's fine, but I'm not like the other activists and radio shows where I care and people plug their stuff.
[00:40:47.161 --> 00:40:48.022]  That's why you're on the show.
[00:40:48.942 --> 00:40:49.943]  Right on, right on, man.
[00:41:07.901 --> 00:41:10.103]  We can go get a camera on them, ask them questions.
[00:41:10.944 --> 00:41:22.515]  It'd be even better maybe to not neutralize the cops and not let them know and their intelligence group that we know and catch them again like we've caught them in England, Canada and the U.S.
[00:41:23.276 --> 00:41:23.796]  Catch them!
[00:41:24.654 --> 00:41:29.415]  I mean, and catch them provocateuring and then pull out, and then get them that way.
[00:41:29.435 --> 00:41:34.656]  Because it's real, a few more times catching them, the public's finally figuring out their wicked game.
[00:41:35.016 --> 00:41:36.156]  Okay, let's take another call.
[00:41:36.216 --> 00:41:38.317]  JJ in Florida, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:41:39.397 --> 00:41:39.837]  Hello.
[00:41:40.577 --> 00:41:41.377]  Hello, welcome.
[00:41:42.197 --> 00:41:43.518]  Hey, how you doing, sir?
[00:41:43.578 --> 00:41:45.058]  Good, good, welcome JJ.
[00:41:45.678 --> 00:41:50.779]  Yeah, I'm a first time caller, and I really enjoy your program.
[00:41:50.859 --> 00:41:51.139]  Thank you.
[00:41:52.202 --> 00:42:00.047]  Yeah, and I've been writing papers and sending them out all over the internet, and I put Endgame in the last one, so they know who the Bilderbergs are and stuff.
[00:42:01.428 --> 00:42:02.509]  Good sir, what's on your mind?
[00:42:02.549 --> 00:42:09.834]  I've got just a different take than you have on all this New World Order and all this kind of stuff, because I've been studying for like 30, 35 years.
[00:42:12.217 --> 00:42:13.218]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[00:42:13.258 --> 00:42:15.919]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:42:15.939 --> 00:42:17.460]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:42:37.629 --> 00:42:40.371]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:42:40.671 --> 00:42:46.135]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:42:46.415 --> 00:42:50.378]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:42:50.658 --> 00:42:55.581]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.TV is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[00:45:34.213 --> 00:45:41.938]  Okay, and as the Republican-Democratic conventions unfold, we'll have We Are Change Colorado, We Are Change Minnesota on the ground for us.
[00:45:41.958 --> 00:45:45.260]  We're going to have other activist groups there, too, with their perspectives.
[00:45:46.261 --> 00:45:47.862]  Going back quickly to J.J.
[00:45:47.922 --> 00:45:48.542]  in Florida.
[00:45:49.183 --> 00:45:52.104]  Okay, J.J., give me your different perspective on the New World Order.
[00:45:53.185 --> 00:45:59.029]  Well, definitely a New World Order being constructed right before our very eyes.
[00:45:59.963 --> 00:46:17.750]  But I just think that that's the anti-Christ system that's going to envelope the world and, you know, he's probably lurking in the Hilderberg group or, you know, lurking in there, maybe just a little guy that nobody really knows yet until, you know, that's what I've been studying.
[00:46:17.770 --> 00:46:19.131]  My dad got me involved with it.
[00:46:20.011 --> 00:46:23.593]  And, you know, the fight is on, definitely.
[00:46:23.793 --> 00:46:25.354]  But I'm fighting for souls.
[00:46:27.054 --> 00:46:28.176]  And that's just my take.
[00:46:28.437 --> 00:46:29.760]  I love the work you do.
[00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:32.225]  I agree with 90% of it.
[00:46:32.245 --> 00:46:37.195]  They're definitely building the New World Order, but the Antichrist will seize control of it.
[00:46:37.904 --> 00:46:40.446]  And he will come to power for a short season.
[00:46:41.087 --> 00:46:42.228]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[00:46:42.268 --> 00:46:42.948]  Here's the deal.
[00:46:43.469 --> 00:46:57.220]  Most of the Christians are bought and paid for by government foundations through their churches, and they're thinking evil is good now, and wars are good, and the Bible says the Antichrist will say he's Jesus.
[00:46:58.081 --> 00:47:01.382]  Okay, he won't run around with horns on his head, and that's what I see happening.
[00:47:01.422 --> 00:47:06.723]  They could say, Jesus came back and says, kill the Iranians, and they'd say, oh, we love you, Jesus.
[00:47:06.863 --> 00:47:07.944]  See, that's the whole point.
[00:47:07.984 --> 00:47:09.284]  The church will be deceived.
[00:47:09.684 --> 00:47:12.725]  And then the modern Scofield Bible came in and made up a bunch of stuff.
[00:47:12.965 --> 00:47:14.266]  I'm not going to get into that whole debate.
[00:47:14.586 --> 00:47:18.207]  I just know Christians aren't doing their job exposing evil and fighting it.
[00:47:18.527 --> 00:47:19.227]  Most of them aren't.
[00:47:19.747 --> 00:47:23.749]  And there's kind of a cop-out of, well, the anti-crisis is coming, this is going to happen, so what are you going to do?
[00:47:24.269 --> 00:47:25.910]  Well, I'm going to warn people I'm going to fight evil.
[00:47:26.970 --> 00:47:29.452]  Let's real fast go to Dana in New York.
[00:47:29.892 --> 00:47:32.153]  Dana, you're on the air with three great We Are Change guys.
[00:47:32.173 --> 00:47:32.553]  Go ahead.
[00:47:33.574 --> 00:47:34.794]  Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[00:47:34.854 --> 00:47:38.636]  I'd like to say I really appreciate the work that you're doing and all the gentlemen from We Are Change.
[00:47:39.016 --> 00:47:40.197]  I have a real quick question.
[00:47:41.457 --> 00:47:46.180]  Before, someone had mentioned they were showing screenings in their local area.
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:48.801]  I was wondering if anyone could give me any
[00:47:49.693 --> 00:47:50.133]  Tell us
[00:48:09.682 --> 00:48:12.023]  You know, people with influence can make things happen a lot quicker.
[00:48:12.043 --> 00:48:13.344]  It gives a lot more credibility.
[00:48:13.904 --> 00:48:17.706]  It's so overwhelming for a lot of people that they just want to turn away from it in denial.
[00:48:17.746 --> 00:48:20.728]  So, any information on how to set that screening process up?
[00:48:20.748 --> 00:48:20.988]  Sure, sure.
[00:48:21.008 --> 00:48:22.549]  Dana, I hate to cut you short.
[00:48:23.029 --> 00:48:25.851]  I may not even have time to get to Dave in Canada and I apologize.
[00:48:25.891 --> 00:48:27.431]  I'll try to have more open phones tomorrow.
[00:48:27.772 --> 00:48:30.073]  Some big guests coming up the next two days before the fourth.
[00:48:32.557 --> 00:48:57.057]  You just call around to the art house theaters, and for a local showing with not much media, get one with a hundred, big city, maybe a three hundred, four hundred theater, and then you set it a month out, and you usually rent it, and you shouldn't, you know, pay more than say two hundred bucks for a hundred and fifty person theater, four hundred bucks for a two hundred, two hundred and fifty person theater, and then you should be able to sell tickets to make your money back to do that, and then you just show the film there.
[00:48:57.077 --> 00:49:01.001]  Usually you've got to tell them you've got the rights to play it, and that gets into a whole other issue.
[00:49:02.041 --> 00:49:03.522]  And then you get it advertised.
[00:49:03.542 --> 00:49:04.863]  You go on local talk radio.
[00:49:04.923 --> 00:49:08.064]  Hey, locals are going to show a film saying the 9-11 is an inside job.
[00:49:08.084 --> 00:49:10.245]  I mean, that's a basic process.
[00:49:10.806 --> 00:49:16.449]  Or you can show it usually at different government buildings for free, rent them out, then promote it or set aside the time.
[00:49:16.789 --> 00:49:17.829]  That's a whole other subject.
[00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:20.691]  We ought to do shows or have websites on that.
[00:49:20.711 --> 00:49:23.112]  We just don't have the personnel to really have websites on it.
[00:49:23.592 --> 00:49:25.073]  I want to thank We Are Change Minnesota.
[00:49:25.093 --> 00:49:25.773]  We Are Change

[00:49:38.401 --> 00:49:39.882]  Anthony, get out We Are Change website.
[00:49:41.063 --> 00:49:47.447]  MNchange.org MNchange.org Nathan Moulton Calgary911Truth.org Say it again.
