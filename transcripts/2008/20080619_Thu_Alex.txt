[00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:00.950]  I don't know.
[00:00:31.846 --> 00:00:35.158]  Alright folks, we're back.
[00:00:36.463 --> 00:00:37.668]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:39.278 --> 00:00:43.740]  Those joining us at PrisonPlanet.tv on the live video feed, I just want to thank you.
[00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.342]  If you missed any of the previous three hours, we covered a lot, folks.
[00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:52.663]  We had Kevin Titus, who worked over at the Governor's Mansion in Austin, Texas.
[00:00:52.964 --> 00:00:55.945]  We had Barbara Lowe Fisher, the National Vaccine Information Center.
[00:00:56.225 --> 00:00:58.526]  We had Mark Dice of The Resistance.
[00:00:58.946 --> 00:01:05.509]  And we also had Jonathan of We Are Change Colorado, who posted a lot of great videos about the black helicopter ops.
[00:01:06.414 --> 00:01:10.215]  The Urban Warfare drills that are going on in Colorado.
[00:01:10.255 --> 00:01:26.880]  And right now we have Michael Markovich, I hope I'm pronouncing his last name correctly, who was arrested for using his First Amendment outside of Philadelphia, right by the Liberty Bell, and recently convicted of preaching on a sidewalk near the Liberty Bell.
[00:01:27.101 --> 00:01:28.261]  Mr. Markovich, are you with us?
[00:01:28.894 --> 00:01:29.534]  Yes, I am.
[00:01:29.834 --> 00:01:31.155]  Thanks for having me on the program.
[00:01:31.175 --> 00:01:31.695]  I appreciate it.
[00:01:31.775 --> 00:01:34.096]  Well, thanks for coming on the program.
[00:01:34.456 --> 00:01:40.518]  A breakdown for the listeners, what you were doing when you were initially arrested and how this process took place.
[00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:43.900]  Well, I travel to a lot of public venues.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.302]  I've been on Alex's program before and we talked about the RNC Convention in New York City.
[00:01:50.402 --> 00:01:57.485]  Everyone come down, put down on Pier 57 with the free speech areas that are being established more and more.
[00:01:58.212 --> 00:02:12.053]  And here at the Liberty Bell Center in Philadelphia, at Independence Hall, they've established what they call a free speech area, or a free speech zone, in which you also need to get a permit to even engage in activities there.
[00:02:12.657 --> 00:02:16.741]  And I was on the public sidewalk which aligns 6th Street in Philadelphia.
[00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:21.345]  Now they built a new center, it's called the Liberty Bell Center, and that's alongside the sidewalk.
[00:02:21.765 --> 00:02:34.797]  And I was standing on that sidewalk speaking to people waiting in line about the important message that's written right on the Liberty Bell, which is from the Book of Leviticus, which is proclaim liberty throughout the land and all the inhabitants thereof.
[00:02:35.438 --> 00:02:48.643]  So as I was speaking to Passerby about abortion in our country and how it's very grievous that this is continuing and about everyone's need to come to know God through Jesus Christ, I'm an evangelist, that's what I do.
[00:02:48.683 --> 00:02:53.245]  I go out to the public square and I declare this message of repentance and the need for a Savior.
[00:02:53.985 --> 00:03:04.069]  And as I was standing on that sidewalk outside the Liberty Bell Center, I was told to go over there and the ranger motioned where I was to go, which was on the other side of the building.
[00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:07.178]  Um, away from the people I was trying to reach.
[00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:09.139]  And this is on a public sidewalk.
[00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:10.199]  It's open to the public.
[00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:11.399]  It's not shut down.
[00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:15.480]  There are other people there that are engaged in, uh, activities.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.541]  And I was prohibited from continuing, um, with my message.
[00:03:21.521 --> 00:03:28.382]  So I ultimately had been, uh, cited for violating the terms and conditions of a permit.
[00:03:28.522 --> 00:03:32.883]  A permit in which I never accepted, uh, but it was pushed upon me.
[00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:39.032]  And this permit was basically a verbal permit, and I was told to go to this free speech area.
[00:03:39.812 --> 00:03:41.213]  So, that's what happened.
[00:03:41.293 --> 00:03:48.675]  I tried to reason with these park rangers, asking them to please speak with our legal counsel before they start instituting this.
[00:03:49.456 --> 00:03:58.419]  In fact, the chief ranger that oversees the area down there said that that was a new policy that was just rolled out, and it had not made it to the rangers in the field yet.
[00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:01.680]  This is what had been testified to during the criminal trial.
[00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.382]  But I had been charged first with violating the terms and conditions of a permit.
[00:04:06.482 --> 00:04:08.223]  Now, this was a permit I never accepted.
[00:04:09.424 --> 00:04:12.366]  And also, and that was for not going to the free speech zone.
[00:04:13.266 --> 00:04:17.369]  The second charge I got in the mail six months later via certified mail.
[00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:25.514]  And this was a violation of the Code of Federal Regulations, like the permitting issue.
[00:04:26.246 --> 00:04:36.090]  But this one cited that I was interfering with agency functions by standing there and speaking to the people on messages on various topics.
[00:04:36.851 --> 00:04:41.893]  So that's what happened, and ultimately I was put on trial and convicted on those two counts.
[00:04:42.293 --> 00:04:45.675]  Well, I want to get into the trial, I want to get into the conviction on the other side.
[00:04:46.115 --> 00:04:47.315]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:47.355 --> 00:04:49.596]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:50.137 --> 00:04:50.897]  We'll be back after this.
[00:05:03.451 --> 00:05:16.158]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:05:16.578 --> 00:05:20.400]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:27.265]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:05:27.646 --> 00:05:30.828]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:38.555]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:05:47.662 --> 00:05:48.002]  I'm good.
[00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:12.182]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:06:12.362 --> 00:06:17.144]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:06:17.524 --> 00:06:28.628]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:06:29.028 --> 00:06:34.591]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons, or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:40.894]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.

[00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:19.552]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:20.092 --> 00:08:24.134]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:28.001 --> 00:08:32.342]  Alex Jones is out on vacation with his family, taking a well-deserved rest.
[00:08:32.382 --> 00:08:34.263]  He will be back for the Sunday program.
[00:08:34.303 --> 00:08:35.323]  I've been sitting in all week.
[00:08:35.363 --> 00:08:36.343]  I'll be here tomorrow.
[00:08:36.723 --> 00:08:47.246]  And we're talking to Michael Markovich, a preacher who was arrested for spreading the word on the sidewalk, folks, and then, I guess, recently convicted by trial.
[00:08:47.947 --> 00:08:51.628]  I'm wondering, Michael, when they arrested you, did they just give you a ticket?
[00:08:51.648 --> 00:08:52.908]  Did they bring you down to the station?
[00:08:52.968 --> 00:08:54.148]  How did that process go?
[00:08:54.468 --> 00:08:56.549]  And then, tell me what happened at the trial.
[00:08:57.734 --> 00:09:23.825]  Well, first, to your first question, what happened is that as I was speaking, I had been approached one final time by the supervising ranger, Saperstein, supervising ranger Saperstein, who came and several other rangers, and they used pain compliance where they bent my hand behind my back and forcibly made me go into the Liberty Bell Center into a room.
[00:09:24.545 --> 00:09:29.408]  In which I had been questioned and then cited and released.
[00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:38.834]  And after that, the citation, the second citation, which is also a federal violation, came in the mail, certified mail, six months later.
[00:09:40.235 --> 00:09:50.501]  And in relationship to the trial itself, that was a two-day trial in which the prosecution put their case on, of course, and then we put our case on.
[00:09:51.342 --> 00:09:53.463]  And ultimately, I had been found
[00:09:54.082 --> 00:10:04.310]  Guilty of violating the terms and conditions of a permit, and secondly for interfering with agency functions by just simply standing on the sidewalk and speaking with people.
[00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:15.919]  So it definitely is very revealing as to where our country is headed in, or it has been headed in this direction for a very long time now, and it's just getting worse.
[00:10:15.979 --> 00:10:20.082]  And this free speech zone establishment, which is becoming more commonplace at major events,
[00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:26.672]  This is now being instituted here at the Liberty Bell Center and Independent Hall on the public sidewalks.
[00:10:26.952 --> 00:10:32.577]  Yeah, it seems like it doesn't even have to be at a main event like the RNC, like the DNC.
[00:10:33.238 --> 00:10:34.119]  It can be anywhere now.
[00:10:34.299 --> 00:10:37.702]  And they're trying to put these into squelch-free speech even further.
[00:10:38.283 --> 00:10:40.345]  They're arresting people, quote-unquote, for peddling.
[00:10:40.865 --> 00:10:43.127]  Uh, when they're giving away DVDs at this point.
[00:10:43.587 --> 00:10:46.289]  I mean, even at a bank, I get the runaround.
[00:10:46.329 --> 00:10:56.556]  It's a total surveillance society, police state, where they want all these forms of identification, they want all these regulations, so that if they don't agree with what you're saying, you won't be able to say it at all.
[00:10:56.816 --> 00:10:58.697]  And that's what this country has really become.
[00:10:58.997 --> 00:11:06.142]  Anything that is labeled, quote-unquote, a free speech zone is bad news, because the free speech zone is this country.
[00:11:06.442 --> 00:11:10.625]  It's any public property that is in the United States of America, in my opinion.
[00:11:11.526 --> 00:11:11.986]  That's right.
[00:11:12.247 --> 00:11:15.290]  And what was very shocking is what Assistant U.S.
[00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.573]  Attorney Richard Goldberg was arguing.
[00:11:17.993 --> 00:11:22.799]  He was stating that our defense, and that was a part of our defense, that it was propaganda.
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:26.003]  And that I was a clear and present danger.
[00:11:26.996 --> 00:11:29.017]  To people being on that public sidewalk.
[00:11:29.117 --> 00:11:38.101]  In the name of safety, they're starting to shut people down from being able to speak on the public sidewalks about issues that are important to them, and it's happening more and more often.
[00:11:38.521 --> 00:11:40.462]  In fact, what happened is that this U.S.
[00:11:40.522 --> 00:11:54.968]  attorney, Richard Goldberg, asked the judge, Judge Rapoport, who heard this case, to send a message not only to me, but to those in the courtroom and anyone else who would dare stand on public property and share their beliefs without government permission.
[00:11:55.646 --> 00:11:57.747]  And it's very, very revealing.
[00:11:58.268 --> 00:11:59.128]  Yeah, it is.
[00:11:59.608 --> 00:12:02.270]  Much like the government has, quote-unquote, become God.
[00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:17.579]  And we know that a lot of these preachers have really sold their flocks down the river by taking government funding and telling them that when the government comes in, listen to them, go to the camps, it's just unbelievable how far this has gone.
[00:12:17.599 --> 00:12:19.260]  It certainly is.
[00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:20.080]  It certainly is.
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.623]  And, you know, they're trying to send this message, and I think that they are
[00:12:25.316 --> 00:12:29.184]  This is getting some attention because of the fund and because I was put on a year probation.
[00:12:29.685 --> 00:12:31.269]  I have to now go down to the U.S.
[00:12:31.309 --> 00:12:32.972]  Probation Office tomorrow by 2 p.m.
[00:12:34.389 --> 00:12:44.974]  and uh... register and not only get permission uh... for you know being able to exercise my rights in public but anywhere i go i need to now get permission from the u.s.
[00:12:45.014 --> 00:12:54.599]  probation office and they could deny me for whatever reason they so desire if i need to go in uh... to a ministry project in another state i have to get permission from the u.s.
[00:12:55.039 --> 00:12:58.141]  probation office so this is really a shocking decision
[00:12:58.741 --> 00:13:04.384]  And I think that it should awaken some people to voice some opposition and to stand up for what is right.
[00:13:05.004 --> 00:13:07.426]  Where can people find your information?
[00:13:07.466 --> 00:13:08.306]  What's the website?
[00:13:08.346 --> 00:13:09.086]  How can people help?
[00:13:10.147 --> 00:13:13.909]  Well, I encourage people to visit us at repentamerica.com.
[00:13:13.929 --> 00:13:17.371]  That's R-E-P-E-N-T America dot com.
[00:13:17.391 --> 00:13:18.171]  And on our website,
[00:13:18.646 --> 00:13:20.427]  There's actually a link to the video footage now.
[00:13:20.467 --> 00:13:22.889]  I know it's at InfoWars.com as well.
[00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:28.753]  If people would like to take a look at that, they can go to our website at RepentAmerica.com.
[00:13:29.153 --> 00:13:30.895]  You also have it on InfoWars.com.
[00:13:30.995 --> 00:13:38.300]  If they want to see it on YouTube, they can just go to YouTube and use the keyword, Liberty Bell Center, and it's the very first video.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:48.227]  And in that video footage, you will see this supervising ranger approach me a couple of times and instruct me to go to this free speech area.
[00:13:48.903 --> 00:13:52.066]  And I had declined that, as well as the verbal permit that was issued.
[00:13:53.266 --> 00:14:02.273]  Now, nowhere in what they call the compendium or in the Code of Federal Regulations do we see them being able to issue verbal permits.
[00:14:02.634 --> 00:14:04.455]  Nowhere there is that even listed.
[00:14:04.555 --> 00:14:10.580]  And the judge argued in his finding of facts that, well, it's not listed, therefore they can issue it.
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.142]  So it really is a bad decision.
[00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:16.457]  And we're working on an appeal right now.
[00:14:16.817 --> 00:14:21.581]  Our legal counsel, our attorney, Scott Shields, is getting ready to file that appeal.
[00:14:22.341 --> 00:14:37.293]  It's our hope that this gets shut down, because if they shut down the public sidewalks to the free expression of ideas at the Liberty Bell Center and at Independence Hall in the birthplace of American freedom, then our nation, as it is right now, is in trouble.
[00:14:39.185 --> 00:14:39.685]  Absolutely.
[00:14:40.106 --> 00:14:51.975]  And that's why it's so important for people to arm themselves with cameras, because even if you do go down in a courtroom, at least in the court of public opinion, we have a chance.
[00:14:52.275 --> 00:14:57.239]  We can show how corrupt the system is and shed light on that, and show how corrupt it is all around.
[00:14:57.279 --> 00:14:59.500]  It's not just the police, but it's the judge.
[00:15:00.041 --> 00:15:02.482]  It's the court system that would rule in favor
[00:15:03.984 --> 00:15:05.745]  Of this, you know, police state measure.
[00:15:05.805 --> 00:15:07.446]  Rule against the First Amendment.
[00:15:07.666 --> 00:15:09.887]  Rule against the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[00:15:10.748 --> 00:15:12.449]  What else are you guys up to?
[00:15:12.489 --> 00:15:14.671]  What's the next step for Repent America?
[00:15:16.111 --> 00:15:25.818]  Well right now we're really concentrating on this particular situation because of what it all entails and trying to get this overturned and ensuring that people
[00:15:26.385 --> 00:15:28.887]  Not only myself, but people who disagree with our message.
[00:15:28.907 --> 00:15:33.931]  And we do believe Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and the life, and that no man comes to the Father but by Him.
[00:15:34.231 --> 00:15:36.033]  But we know that people are going to disagree with that.
[00:15:36.433 --> 00:15:49.143]  But that's why the public street should be open up to discussion and open up to the free expression of ideas, not shut down by government because they're afraid of safety issues, or they're using this in the name of safety, but they want to silence us.
[00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:54.119]  And we're going to be headed to a couple of events coming up.
[00:15:54.139 --> 00:15:55.579]  We're going to be in Washington, D.C.
[00:15:55.659 --> 00:15:58.100]  for the 4th of July and at some other events.
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:03.261]  But being out there on a regular basis, this is becoming very much commonplace.
[00:16:03.801 --> 00:16:09.603]  The free speech zone establishments that are at these major events, that are not only at major events, as you said, but they're on college campuses.
[00:16:10.441 --> 00:16:18.007]  They're becoming now just a regular part of a city where someone is told you have to go over there if you want to express your views.
[00:16:18.647 --> 00:16:26.894]  And what's going to stop them from just shutting it all down completely without that permit and then denial of those permits?
[00:16:26.994 --> 00:16:33.659]  It's very troublesome in this case, as I said, very revealing as to the direction our country continues to head in.
[00:16:34.454 --> 00:16:35.635]  And what is that direction?
[00:16:35.675 --> 00:16:46.465]  I mean, the way I've been seeing it is, you know, you're gonna have more police on the streets, you're seeing a merger of the military and the police, especially in these drills that are going on in Denver.
[00:16:46.585 --> 00:16:50.249]  I think we're seeing even more sophisticated types of control where
[00:16:50.589 --> 00:17:15.168]  You know, organizations like Recreate 68 get found out, you know, that they're bad, that they're trying to incite violence at the DNC, that they're telling people to bring red paint and throw it on others, to bring shields, to wear armor, and of course this is the only group that actually gets the quote-unquote permit to protest, and then they're exposed, and all they do is they change their name, and it's basically the same members, and they're the only ones that get the permit.
[00:17:15.408 --> 00:17:20.032]  It seems like they're setting up the people that don't know for violence in order to bring in
[00:17:20.612 --> 00:17:27.658]  You know, the military and police, to put the squelch on freedom of speech yet again, to make it seem like the country wants Barack Obama.
[00:17:28.578 --> 00:17:29.559]  There's no question about it.
[00:17:29.739 --> 00:17:33.342]  That's exactly what their goal is.
[00:17:33.502 --> 00:17:40.728]  They're using fear, these fear tactics, and telling the people, well, you know, we can't have that because there'd be riots, there'd be this and there'd be that.
[00:17:40.768 --> 00:17:48.193]  In the name of safety, we're telling people they need to stay over there, behind that building, behind that tree over there, down the street.
[00:17:48.514 --> 00:17:50.335]  You know, there's limits on this.
[00:17:50.931 --> 00:18:01.421]  It's so subjective, and these directives are becoming more and more evident through what's happening to a lot of different people that are out there at these events.
[00:18:01.461 --> 00:18:14.694]  Now, we're headed out to the DNC Convention as well as the RNC Convention, and we have reason to believe that they're going to do as they did in New York City and up in Massachusetts and Boston.
[00:18:15.354 --> 00:18:35.114]  When they had the cages established, these cages, and I'm saying cages because they're fences that basically you're put into, and you could express yourself in those cages, particularly at the DNC convention where that happened, but then at the RNC convention they put people down in an abandoned warehouse on Pier 57,
[00:18:36.639 --> 00:19:03.653]  In caged-in areas, and when I was escorted in there after having been arrested on a public sidewalk there, because I wouldn't go to the sight and sound or the free speech area that they had established, I was sitting in a cage and looking at all these people of different types of political positions and ideas, and they were all criminalized because they were out there exercising their right to free speech, and it's very disturbing.
[00:19:04.113 --> 00:19:06.475]  It's just amazing where this country has gone.
[00:19:06.555 --> 00:19:10.217]  It truly has become land of the coward, home of the slave.
[00:19:10.517 --> 00:19:15.400]  And when they try to tell you that a free speech zone is a cage, think about it.
[00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:16.841]  They're treating you like an animal.
[00:19:16.941 --> 00:19:20.544]  Literally treating you like a pet and letting you know they're the boss.
[00:19:20.984 --> 00:19:22.586]  Well, I'm not in line with that.
[00:19:22.646 --> 00:19:23.447]  I'm not down with it.
[00:19:23.667 --> 00:19:25.008]  I'm not getting into any cage.
[00:19:25.289 --> 00:19:27.731]  If you've got to arrest me because of that, so be it.
[00:19:28.412 --> 00:19:31.255]  Again, I'm encouraging a lot of people to go to the DNC this year.
[00:19:31.375 --> 00:19:32.557]  Arm yourself with cameras.
[00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:34.579]  Let them know you're not going to cause violence.
[00:19:34.839 --> 00:19:38.063]  Let them know that you might not have a permit, but you're going to be there anyway.
[00:19:38.423 --> 00:19:39.945]  Give out the website one more time, Michael.
[00:19:40.706 --> 00:19:44.893]  It is repentamerica.com, R-E-P-E-N-T-A-M-E-R-I-C-A.com.
[00:19:45.113 --> 00:19:46.636]  Alright, thank you for spending time with us, Michael.
[00:19:46.676 --> 00:19:47.577]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:47.598 --> 00:19:51.865]  We're going to take your calls on the other side and play this World Trade Center 7 clip one more time.
[00:20:03.217 --> 00:20:04.879]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:20:05.179 --> 00:20:08.623]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:20:08.783 --> 00:20:10.625]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:20:11.246 --> 00:20:13.969]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:20:14.289 --> 00:20:19.655]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[00:20:20.015 --> 00:20:23.918]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:20:49.755 --> 00:20:51.096]  We're good to go.
[00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:09.862]  Have you ever suffered from giardia, food poisoning, heavy metal poisoning, arthritis, fatigue, or high cholesterol?
[00:21:10.082 --> 00:21:16.243]  Maybe you're one of the 75 million Americans that the Center for Disease Control reports as suffering from internal parasites.
[00:21:16.644 --> 00:21:25.706]  If so, Freshwater Organics is proud to introduce you to a million-year-old miracle that has been used all over the world by health-conscious individuals seeking alternatives to chemicals and drugs.

[00:21:54.441 --> 00:21:54.661]  That's 888-949-3570.
[00:22:02.645 --> 00:22:03.625]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:22:03.685 --> 00:22:08.467]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:22:08.647 --> 00:22:16.450]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:22.072]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:22:22.292 --> 00:22:29.254]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:22:29.554 --> 00:22:34.899]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:39.904]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:22:40.224 --> 00:22:47.852]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:22:48.172 --> 00:22:50.875]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt,
[00:22:51.295 --> 00:22:54.398]  Gold, on its own, has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:22:54.718 --> 00:22:56.380]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:58.582 --> 00:22:58.982]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:59.002 --> 00:23:06.309]  With the hot and muggy season upon us, most people shut their windows to stay cool.
[00:23:06.609 --> 00:23:11.113]  The problem is, the air you breathe inside your home is not as clean as outdoor air.
[00:23:11.434 --> 00:23:16.198]  And who wants an ugly, plastic, noisy air purifier taking up space in their beautiful home?
[00:23:17.219 --> 00:23:18.319]  There is an alternative.
[00:23:18.499 --> 00:23:21.360]  Himalayan Crystal Salt Lamps from Ionic Salts.

[00:24:12.515 --> 00:24:15.058]  Alright folks, we're going to be taking your calls in just a moment.
[00:24:15.078 --> 00:24:16.379]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:16.399 --> 00:24:17.621]  It's the final half hour.
[00:24:18.662 --> 00:24:19.123]  Check it out.
[00:24:19.483 --> 00:24:20.184]  Video feed.
[00:24:20.344 --> 00:24:21.285]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:24:21.325 --> 00:24:26.191]  If you missed any of it, we're going to be replaying the whole thing over at InfoWars.com for four whole hours.
[00:24:26.211 --> 00:24:28.474]  Remember, you're not getting this news anywhere else.
[00:24:29.753 --> 00:24:33.157]  Okay, no one else is showing you video of black helicopters in Denver.
[00:24:33.197 --> 00:24:33.918]  We're doing that.
[00:24:34.238 --> 00:24:37.903]  No one else is covering this, uh, breaking BBC conspiracy files.
[00:24:37.963 --> 00:24:41.387]  It's been talked about, but we're gonna be the first ones to show you this on air.
[00:24:41.908 --> 00:24:42.809]  So let's just go to it.
[00:24:42.849 --> 00:24:46.293]  Let's, let's pop it up and, uh, let's play the clip.
[00:25:11.641 --> 00:25:14.263]  Building 7 is the smoking gun of 9-11.
[00:25:14.603 --> 00:25:19.427]  It is the most obvious example of controlled demolition.
[00:25:20.959 --> 00:25:21.960]  It's not real.
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:25.843]  The materials and the technologies just aren't there.
[00:25:26.143 --> 00:25:27.405]  If they were, I'd know.
[00:25:28.345 --> 00:25:29.586]  In the building, I heard explosions.
[00:25:29.987 --> 00:25:31.208]  Outside the building, I heard explosions.
[00:25:35.717 --> 00:25:40.341]  I saw this building, which had never been hit by a plane, come crashing straight down.
[00:25:40.962 --> 00:25:46.667]  For it to fall symmetrically and completely and rapidly was quite astounding.
[00:25:47.347 --> 00:25:50.550]  Could one use a controlled demolition on any building?
[00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.890]  Sure.
[00:25:51.191 --> 00:25:52.031]  Did it happen to WTC7 on 9-11?
[00:25:52.071 --> 00:25:52.472]  No, it did not.
[00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:03.473]  As far as I know, that's the first time it's happened in architectural history.
[00:26:03.533 --> 00:26:06.496]  A steel high-rise building has collapsed simply because of damage and fire.
[00:26:07.497 --> 00:26:08.978]  You can hear the building creak.
[00:26:09.218 --> 00:26:10.239]  You can hear things fall.
[00:26:10.259 --> 00:26:11.861]  You can hear the fire burning.
[00:26:12.582 --> 00:26:14.504]  And you can hear the destruction way above it.
[00:26:17.707 --> 00:26:21.491]  No steel frame high-rise building has ever collapsed due to fire.
[00:26:25.407 --> 00:26:27.329]  You know, you have to look at what was inside Building 7.
[00:26:27.389 --> 00:26:30.451]  You had the largest Secret Service field office outside of Washington, D.C.
[00:26:30.791 --> 00:26:32.473]  You had the largest CIA field office.
[00:26:32.933 --> 00:26:35.495]  You had a number of government agencies inside the building.
[00:26:35.515 --> 00:26:38.858]  I think we're just about the last ones in this building right now.
[00:26:39.158 --> 00:26:39.919]  I think you should leave.
[00:26:39.939 --> 00:26:46.964]  Everybody else is gone.
[00:26:47.745 --> 00:26:49.707]  The first explosion I heard when I was on the stairwell in.
[00:26:51.368 --> 00:26:52.008]  Like a boom.
[00:26:52.889 --> 00:26:53.890]  Like an explosion.
[00:26:58.544 --> 00:27:00.845]  Jane, what more can you tell us about this collapse?
[00:27:00.925 --> 00:27:02.626]  Details are very, very sketchy.
[00:27:07.748 --> 00:27:10.810]  The entire half inch of the beam is gone.
[00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:12.631]  Entirely dissolved.
[00:27:13.131 --> 00:27:18.413]  Something happened to cause the steel to really thin and in some places to disappear entirely.
[00:27:25.851 --> 00:27:40.744]  Building 7 is the first high-rise building in the world that has collapsed solely due to... Well, there you have it, folks.
[00:27:41.825 --> 00:27:42.606]  The BBC.
[00:27:43.167 --> 00:27:45.909]  First time the PrisonPlan.TV subscribers are seeing it.
[00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:51.094]  And I want to review it one more time before we go to callers, and we're going to take your calls right now.
[00:27:52.366 --> 00:27:53.807]  You have Sandar at the end there.
[00:27:53.867 --> 00:27:56.368]  He's the guy that said 25% of the building was scooped out.
[00:27:56.428 --> 00:27:57.188]  Total nonsense.
[00:27:57.228 --> 00:27:58.749]  You have Richard Clark on there.
[00:27:59.049 --> 00:28:00.110]  Total apologist.
[00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:01.690]  Total official version.
[00:28:02.231 --> 00:28:04.692]  At best, not even a lighthop guy.
[00:28:04.812 --> 00:28:07.733]  More of a, more of a, oh, we're so incompetent.
[00:28:08.113 --> 00:28:08.674]  He's scum.
[00:28:09.054 --> 00:28:09.414]  Okay?
[00:28:09.654 --> 00:28:12.235]  He's total and complete scum.
[00:28:13.096 --> 00:28:13.836]  I'm going to say it again.
[00:28:14.076 --> 00:28:15.117]  Richard Clark is scum.
[00:28:15.797 --> 00:28:19.239]  And Lizzo getting up there and saying, I'd know about it.
[00:28:19.999 --> 00:28:21.420]  I'd know about it.
[00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:22.570]  Really?
[00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:23.851]  Would you tell about it?
[00:28:23.871 --> 00:28:32.216]  Because you have a bunch of government contracts and, you know, you have a family-owned business called Controlled Demolition Incorporated that cleaned up the World Trade Center.
[00:28:33.077 --> 00:28:34.458]  These people are criminals, folks.
[00:28:34.498 --> 00:28:35.718]  They need to be brought to justice.
[00:28:36.039 --> 00:28:38.620]  Let's go to our first caller on the list.
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.021]  Let's go to Dan in Illinois.
[00:28:40.041 --> 00:28:40.701]  Dan, are you there?
[00:28:40.721 --> 00:28:41.922]  Hello, Jason.
[00:28:41.962 --> 00:28:42.803]  How are you doing, Dan?
[00:28:43.163 --> 00:28:43.543]  Okay.
[00:28:43.823 --> 00:28:47.946]  You know, the other day you had a guest on from Counterpunch, a gentleman.
[00:28:48.226 --> 00:28:49.527]  Yes, we had Paul Craig Roberts on.
[00:28:50.322 --> 00:28:53.323]  And he's basically still had the faith in the political system.
[00:28:53.343 --> 00:28:54.084]  Yeah.
[00:28:54.264 --> 00:28:57.185]  Well, you know, we all know that the left and the right is all fake and everything else.
[00:28:57.205 --> 00:29:12.811]  But my question is, how does any thinking person, after 2006, when the United States of America people came out in record numbers and voted against Bush by putting the Democrats in the Congress and the Senate, and in the last two years, they've done absolutely nothing.
[00:29:12.831 --> 00:29:15.872]  In fact, they just gave him a trillion dollars today or something like that for the war.
[00:29:16.536 --> 00:29:18.697]  How can any thinking person have any faith in that?
[00:29:18.878 --> 00:29:19.938]  Well, here's the deal.
[00:29:20.238 --> 00:29:31.886]  With him and others, I've noticed, when you are in these administrations, like Paul Craig Roberts was, like Ray McGovern was, it is extremely difficult for them to get past this left-right paradigm.
[00:29:32.186 --> 00:29:37.009]  Probably because the right-wing end of it is outwardly evil in many cases, man.
[00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:40.231]  I'm gonna get into your question a little bit more on the other side.
[00:29:40.251 --> 00:29:42.133]  It's the Alex Jones Show, InfoWars.com.
[00:29:53.391 --> 00:29:56.378]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:00.026]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.261]  If you're an adult male, you need to listen to this information.
[00:30:06.461 --> 00:30:10.362]  By the age of 60, half of all men have a prostate-related problem.
[00:30:10.582 --> 00:30:16.924]  In the past, many men have turned to saw palmetto to support prostate health, but now there's something much better.
[00:30:17.184 --> 00:30:18.584]  It's called beta-prostate.
[00:30:18.824 --> 00:30:24.085]  Beta-prostate contains 3,000 times more healthy plant sterols than ordinary saw palmetto.
[00:30:24.345 --> 00:30:30.267]  In fact, you'd have to take a hundred saw palmetto capsules to get the same benefits of one dose of beta-prostate.
[00:30:30.527 --> 00:30:35.931]  It's guaranteed to provide noticeable support, even if you're already having prostate-related health issues.
[00:30:36.251 --> 00:30:40.113]  Now you can get Roger Mason's Beta Prostate Formula through this special offer.
[00:30:40.334 --> 00:30:44.536]  And if you call now, you'll learn how to get a free bottle of Beta Prostate with your order.

[00:30:46.878 --> 00:30:47.638]  Here's how to order.
[00:30:47.899 --> 00:30:49.600]  Call now to order Beta Prostate.
[00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:52.662]  Dial 1-800-457-9914.
[00:30:53.082 --> 00:30:55.924]  Support your prostate with safe, all-natural ingredients.
[00:30:56.244 --> 00:30:56.624]  Dial 1-800-457-9914.
[00:31:00.077 --> 00:31:02.459]  That's 1-800-457-9914.
[00:31:03.539 --> 00:31:04.940]  It is a big idea.
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:07.062]  A new world order.
[00:31:07.762 --> 00:31:12.165]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:31:12.665 --> 00:31:14.426]  It's known as the Builder Earth.
[00:31:14.506 --> 00:31:17.748]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:31:18.288 --> 00:31:20.690]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:31:21.457 --> 00:31:28.794]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:31:31.815 --> 00:31:36.778]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:31:37.259 --> 00:31:40.721]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:31:41.121 --> 00:31:43.603]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:31:43.683 --> 00:31:44.844]  Most people have no idea.
[00:31:44.864 --> 00:31:45.624]  They're not after money.
[00:31:45.644 --> 00:31:46.705]  They have all the money they need.
[00:31:46.925 --> 00:31:47.626]  They're after power.
[00:31:47.906 --> 00:31:48.586]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[00:32:00.574 --> 00:32:01.635]  You have been warned.
[00:32:02.435 --> 00:32:04.517]  Hi, this is Dave from Ready Reserve Foods.
[00:32:04.957 --> 00:32:11.582]  I have been waiting patiently for the government and mainstream media to inform you of what is turning out to be the biggest problem facing the world in the last 50 years.
[00:32:12.242 --> 00:32:17.446]  For the last three years, the Earth has consumed more food than it has been able to produce, and it has now finally caught up with us.
[00:32:17.786 --> 00:32:23.870]  In the U.S., commodities such as flour and rice are already being rationed, and the next rice crop won't be available for another four to five months.
[00:32:24.651 --> 00:32:31.095]  It's fall in the Southern Hemisphere, and many countries are short the food necessary to make it through the winter and have stopped exporting certain commodities altogether.
[00:32:31.874 --> 00:32:33.015]  Remember our trade deficit?
[00:32:33.455 --> 00:32:38.498]  Trillions of dollars have stacked up outside the country and are now rushing in to buy our food production at any price.
[00:32:39.138 --> 00:32:44.882]  By late summer, if not early fall, it is likely our government will step in and control food and food exports under martial law.
[00:32:45.442 --> 00:32:46.903]  Call Ready Reserve Foods at 1-800-453-2202.

[00:33:04.614 --> 00:33:09.737]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:10.437 --> 00:33:12.739]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:18.999 --> 00:33:20.721]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back.
[00:33:21.201 --> 00:33:39.097]  It is the Alex Jones Show, and to finish up on that caller's point, everybody I've interviewed that was part of, you know, the Reagan administration in the 80s, or the Bush administration in the 90s, or worked with these people, always seems to fall back into this left-right paradigm.
[00:33:39.457 --> 00:33:48.264]  You know, when I interviewed Ray McGovern years ago, when we had just put the Democrats into office, he feels like, you know, now they need to be emboldened, but they're going to do something.
[00:33:48.304 --> 00:33:49.164]  They didn't do anything.
[00:33:49.705 --> 00:33:50.045]  Okay?
[00:33:50.545 --> 00:33:55.169]  Paul Craig Roberts, although he realizes both of these are corporatized candidates, Barack Obama,
[00:33:55.729 --> 00:33:59.011]  He feels is the better one because he's not associated with the Republicans.
[00:33:59.051 --> 00:34:00.572]  I mean, I brought up Bilderberg to him.
[00:34:00.952 --> 00:34:17.123]  I brought up the fact that him and Hillary had probably met with those guys, and he just does not give any credence to the fact that Bilderberg or Bohemian Grove or Davos or any of this stuff really sets any policy, and I couldn't be of a more different opinion.
[00:34:17.823 --> 00:34:18.844]  Let's go to the next caller.
[00:34:18.904 --> 00:34:24.167]  Let's take, let's see, let's take James in Ohio.
[00:34:24.227 --> 00:34:24.888]  James, you're with me.
[00:34:26.886 --> 00:34:27.466]  We got James.
[00:34:27.486 --> 00:34:28.967]  How you doing, Jason?
[00:34:29.167 --> 00:34:29.727]  How you doing, man?
[00:34:30.848 --> 00:34:31.648]  Not too bad.
[00:34:31.708 --> 00:34:33.049]  I was just calling.
[00:34:33.069 --> 00:34:36.971]  I didn't know if you were aware.
[00:34:37.471 --> 00:34:47.877]  A while back, Alex was talking about some marine exercise, military exercises that were maybe supposed to be going on in Indianapolis.
[00:34:49.033 --> 00:34:51.074]  Yes.
[00:34:51.114 --> 00:34:52.615]  I think they were actually going on this week.
[00:34:52.675 --> 00:35:10.786]  I got a call earlier this week about those types of drills, and the ones I've been focusing on are the ones out in Denver, but apparently there's a couple more going on in the country, and there's a good chance that... I'm pretty sure one of the callers did call in and say it was going on in Indiana, and it was urban warfare training, right?
[00:35:11.386 --> 00:35:14.208]  Right, and the only thing I wanted to bring attention to was
[00:35:14.873 --> 00:35:15.414]  We're good to go.
[00:35:22.472 --> 00:35:24.813]  What is it, Lone Lantern?
[00:35:25.553 --> 00:35:26.554]  LoneLantern.org, sure.
[00:35:26.994 --> 00:35:32.357]  Yeah, but I thought it was supposed to be coming up and I wasn't sure if it was going on.
[00:35:32.497 --> 00:35:33.737]  I ain't seen nothing about it.
[00:35:34.078 --> 00:35:45.163]  Well, I think it is going on right now, but if you want to take a look at the type of drills that they're probably carrying out, go to loosechange911.com and go check out the drills going on over at Colorado.
[00:35:45.183 --> 00:35:45.403]  Go ahead.
[00:35:46.129 --> 00:35:47.090]  I also had a question.
[00:35:48.291 --> 00:35:58.099]  Like I said, I talked to you previously and we talked about just getting a membership to Prison Planet TV, the plethora of information that's there.
[00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:06.025]  And I recently was listening to an old MP3 of Alex's where he talked to Hopsicker.
[00:36:06.466 --> 00:36:07.447]  Sure, Daniel Hopsicker.
[00:36:07.467 --> 00:36:10.229]  He did Muhammad Ata and the Venice Flying Circus.
[00:36:10.879 --> 00:36:14.043]  Right, and I can't find that on Prison Planet TV.
[00:36:14.063 --> 00:36:21.392]  I don't know if anybody... If it's not there, it's probably somewhere archived in the free archives over at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:36:21.472 --> 00:36:23.074]  I'd say run a couple Google searches.
[00:36:23.995 --> 00:36:25.757]  Give me a MySpace message.
[00:36:25.797 --> 00:36:27.019]  I'll see if I can dig it up for you.
[00:36:27.319 --> 00:36:39.843]  Yeah, I really dig Hopsicker's research, because he goes into the fact that the hijackers indeed had very odd intelligence ties, and on top of the intelligence ties, they had ties to being drug dealers.
[00:36:39.883 --> 00:36:44.825]  I mean, these guys weren't radical Islamists, they were cokeheads that were down at strip clubs.
[00:36:44.945 --> 00:36:45.885]  Let's be real, folks.
[00:36:46.485 --> 00:36:48.106]  Let's go to Wes in Idaho.
[00:36:48.186 --> 00:36:48.966]  Wes, are you with us?
[00:36:50.487 --> 00:36:51.247]  What's on your mind, Wes?
[00:36:52.287 --> 00:36:53.348]  Hello, Jason.
[00:36:53.448 --> 00:36:54.188]  Yes, how are you, sir?
[00:36:55.251 --> 00:36:56.172]  Oh, not too bad.
[00:36:56.432 --> 00:37:02.175]  I wanted to comment on vaccinations, flu shots, and allergy shots.
[00:37:02.255 --> 00:37:15.283]  Don't hear much about allergy shots, but on November 22nd, 1963, I just turned 13 years old, I was given an allergy shot and nearly died from a reaction.
[00:37:16.023 --> 00:37:23.848]  This term that Alex continues to use, I just heard, tainted vaccinations, is misleading.
[00:37:24.366 --> 00:37:35.092]  There is never been any scientific proof that vaccinations, and I'll add flu shots and allergy shots, are safe and effective.
[00:37:36.365 --> 00:37:36.965]  No, I'm with you.
[00:37:37.326 --> 00:37:37.706]  You're right.
[00:37:37.726 --> 00:37:41.388]  I mean, I guess that he uses that for the layman's just coming into this.
[00:37:41.668 --> 00:37:41.968]  You're right.
[00:37:42.028 --> 00:37:44.210]  All these vaccinations are poison in my opinion.
[00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:45.270]  I don't trust any of them.
[00:37:45.571 --> 00:37:50.473]  You can add flu shots and allergy shots to those as well.
[00:37:50.554 --> 00:37:53.415]  I don't hear much discussion about allergy shots.
[00:37:53.535 --> 00:37:56.357]  I'd like to know exactly what I was shot up to.
[00:37:57.125 --> 00:38:03.490]  I'll tell you what, why don't you go down to NVIC.org and see what kind of information you can dig up over there.
[00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:12.618]  We had a great guest on earlier today discussing it, but when somebody called me up and asked me if I would take any of these vaccinations or any of these shots, I flat out said no.
[00:38:13.098 --> 00:38:19.924]  I'm not saying that every single shot out there is pure and complete poison, but I'm not putting it past them and I'm not taking the stuff.
[00:38:19.964 --> 00:38:21.005]  I thank you for the call, Wes.
[00:38:21.766 --> 00:38:23.707]  Let's go to Rodney in Kentucky.
[00:38:23.767 --> 00:38:24.408]  Rodney, are you there?
[00:38:26.656 --> 00:38:28.717]  You're doing a fantastic job, sir.
[00:38:28.857 --> 00:38:29.498]  Well, thank you, man.
[00:38:30.739 --> 00:38:36.683]  On the heels of your special guest you had, I'd just like for everybody that's out there to crack open their Bible today and take a look at Psalm 917.
[00:38:37.784 --> 00:38:42.047]  It'll kind of... just ponder it for a minute or two.
[00:38:42.108 --> 00:38:48.052]  The reason I called you is I want to know... I know you can't give a definite answer, but where is the line drawn?
[00:38:48.392 --> 00:38:50.534]  When is too much enough?
[00:38:51.112 --> 00:38:52.837]  You know, I mean, I look at the video.
[00:38:52.997 --> 00:38:55.785]  My big thing, the line in the sand for me is the kids.
[00:38:55.825 --> 00:38:56.166]  You're right.
[00:38:56.186 --> 00:38:57.209]  People out there that have children.
[00:38:57.952 --> 00:39:00.633]  I look at the video of the 16-year-old boy, you know, in the video.
[00:39:01.093 --> 00:39:10.398]  Now then, I'm not trying to be Michael Wagon at all, so I won't even, you know, go down that line, but if that was my son... You're talking about, hold on, you're talking about the kid, let's be clear here.
[00:39:10.618 --> 00:39:12.879]  You're talking about the kid who had his teeth knocked out.
[00:39:12.919 --> 00:39:14.179]  In fact, let's play the video.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.020]  By an officer, yeah.
[00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:16.600]  Yeah, let's play it.
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:18.681]  Hold on one second, we'll get back to your call in a moment.
[00:39:18.701 --> 00:39:18.961]  Sure.
[00:39:19.822 --> 00:39:21.382]  Let me make sure that I'm actually on there.
[00:39:21.723 --> 00:39:22.323]  Am I on there?
[00:39:22.683 --> 00:39:23.183]  Do we have it?
[00:39:23.343 --> 00:39:25.704]  Do we have the video for the... There it is right there.
[00:39:25.744 --> 00:39:27.065]  Alright, let's play it.
[00:39:30.399 --> 00:39:34.942]  A police officer caught on tape slamming a teenager's head into a wall.
[00:39:35.343 --> 00:39:37.724]  He knocked out three of the young man's teeth.
[00:39:37.804 --> 00:39:42.087]  It happened after the 16-year-old was arrested for violating rules at a transit center.
[00:39:42.127 --> 00:39:45.310]  You also see the 16-year-old being dragged across the floor.
[00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:47.331]  The officer is suspended without pay.
[00:39:47.872 --> 00:39:53.716]  An investigation found the officer used excessive force but concluded that the teen's injuries were, quote, unintentional.
[00:39:54.454 --> 00:39:55.395]  Yeah, unintentional.
[00:39:55.655 --> 00:39:56.436]  My God.
[00:39:56.896 --> 00:40:04.003]  They just took this kid, smashed his face into a cinder block or brick wall, and put the guy down.
[00:40:04.043 --> 00:40:06.345]  I mean, this is a 16-year-old kid against a grown man.
[00:40:07.066 --> 00:40:12.711]  I gotta tell you, although there's lines to be drawn on the sand, my line was drawn when I found out about 9-11.
[00:40:12.751 --> 00:40:13.492]  That was it.
[00:40:13.532 --> 00:40:15.514]  That's when I decided to get active.
[00:40:15.534 --> 00:40:17.055]  But I think it's different for everybody.
[00:40:17.075 --> 00:40:17.576]  What do you think?
[00:40:18.308 --> 00:40:27.991]  Well, I mean, I agree with you 100% because I buy 50 blank DVDs every two weeks and copy Loose Chain 2nd Edition, Freedom to Fascism, and Martial Law 9-11 and hand them out.
[00:40:28.431 --> 00:40:33.533]  But what I'm saying is with this, this is one of these times where I'm not calling for anybody to do anything.
[00:40:33.573 --> 00:40:37.514]  I'm saying if that was my son, I have a 15-year-old son, a 5-year-old daughter.
[00:40:37.854 --> 00:40:43.340]  If that man had laid his hand on my son like that, I would give him something to remember that by for the rest of his life.
[00:40:43.601 --> 00:40:47.505]  Every time he couldn't use his right arm or walk with a limp for the rest of his life, he'd think about that.
[00:40:47.525 --> 00:40:49.367]  I mean, that's something like that.
[00:40:49.407 --> 00:40:50.408]  That's our children.
[00:40:50.729 --> 00:40:51.890]  That is the next generation.
[00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:53.331]  That is your flesh and blood.
[00:40:53.792 --> 00:40:59.098]  And if you just sit by and let people do something like that to you, I mean, that to me, something has to be done about that.
[00:40:59.278 --> 00:40:59.979]  I'm with you, man.
[00:40:59.999 --> 00:41:02.420]  I'm glad you're so fired up, because that should get you fired up.
[00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:03.461]  Thanks for the call, Rodney.
[00:41:03.862 --> 00:41:15.471]  You know, another thing that totally fires me up, and another thing I said to this young gentleman who asked me about my Infowars.com bracelet, was, I was like, look, I'm going to lay it out for you right now.
[00:41:16.291 --> 00:41:19.093]  You're telling me that you have no power, you can't do anything about it.
[00:41:20.114 --> 00:41:22.096]  I'm going to just let you know who runs things, okay?
[00:41:22.316 --> 00:41:23.016]  The people that
[00:41:23.877 --> 00:41:31.944]  Say that they're Christian conservatives, that you praise as your leaders, are occultists, that are into pedophilia, that like to rape little kids.
[00:41:32.424 --> 00:41:32.724]  Okay?
[00:41:33.145 --> 00:41:34.066]  That's the bottom line.
[00:41:34.426 --> 00:41:35.266]  That should be enough.
[00:41:35.927 --> 00:41:36.267]  Okay?
[00:41:36.708 --> 00:41:38.089]  A lot of these guys get caught.
[00:41:38.129 --> 00:41:38.809]  Look at Foley.
[00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:41.652]  Foley was heading up the CPS division of the government.
[00:41:41.932 --> 00:41:44.294]  You know, he was, oh, we need to protect the children.
[00:41:44.334 --> 00:41:45.295]  What's he get caught doing?
[00:41:45.375 --> 00:41:47.416]  Oh, he's paging 16-year-old boys.
[00:41:48.328 --> 00:41:54.356]  Dennis Hassard has lived with his male assistant now for years and years and years and years.
[00:41:54.937 --> 00:42:04.350]  We know about Barney Frank getting caught back in the 80s, when I think he was still a Republican, with an underage male brothel in Connecticut.
[00:42:05.174 --> 00:42:05.494]  Okay?
[00:42:05.875 --> 00:42:09.717]  The horror stories that have come out of the Bohemian Grove via the Franklin cover-up.
[00:42:10.017 --> 00:42:11.458]  Go watch Conspiracy of Silence.
[00:42:11.638 --> 00:42:12.859]  You think you've got a strong stomach?
[00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:21.645]  It's 45 minutes long, it's on YouTube, and I'll tell you what, the first time I came across the information, I couldn't keep my lunch down.
[00:42:21.905 --> 00:42:23.507]  Let's go to Peter in North Carolina.
[00:42:23.547 --> 00:42:24.167]  Peter, are you there?
[00:42:24.767 --> 00:42:33.173]  Hey Jason, I want to thank you for having the courage to continue talking about what very few others are willing to talk about.
[00:42:33.193 --> 00:42:34.234]  Well, thank you.
[00:42:35.335 --> 00:42:49.544]  I wanted to comment about, you know, you had a guy on earlier that had a website, Repent America, and I see very few Christians that really see the hand of God and all that is going on.
[00:42:49.564 --> 00:43:01.112]  You know, the Bible talks about a time when Christ will actually be coming back, and I believe that we're seeing that day at hand, and you know, Jesus said that
[00:43:02.350 --> 00:43:03.392]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:43:12.574 --> 00:43:18.696]  Well, I would say this, because most of these Christian communities and these churches are anything but.
[00:43:18.736 --> 00:43:20.157]  They're like cults, man.
[00:43:20.177 --> 00:43:24.879]  They just want to sing and dance and read scripture and think everything's alright.
[00:43:25.199 --> 00:43:27.780]  But the bottom line is they're not really acting like Christians.
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:30.641]  They're not out there trying to solve the social woes that are out there.
[00:43:30.661 --> 00:43:32.382]  They're not reaching out to their fellow man.
[00:43:32.682 --> 00:43:38.224]  And they're willing to just lay down and become sheep and obey the preacher as if he's the godlike figure.
[00:43:38.889 --> 00:43:41.431]  Absolutely, but that's not what I'm saying at all.
[00:43:41.811 --> 00:43:58.622]  I think that the institutionalized Christianity that we see out there is, you know, they're pushing ridiculous subjects that really are not relevant and, you know, separating people by issues like homosexuality or abortion.
[00:43:59.306 --> 00:44:03.748]  Well, the real criminals are raping and robbing, you know, the country blind.
[00:44:03.788 --> 00:44:05.849]  You don't even know how much I'm with you on that.
[00:44:05.889 --> 00:44:06.990]  Thank you for the call, Peter.
[00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:09.251]  I really... Exactly.
[00:44:09.451 --> 00:44:12.673]  Why are we foc... And not that those aren't real issues, you know what I mean?
[00:44:13.013 --> 00:44:14.213]  But they're side issues.
[00:44:14.634 --> 00:44:16.695]  Right now, our country's going down the tubes.
[00:44:17.495 --> 00:44:23.320]  And he's right, you know, homosexual rights and abortion should be side issues for Christians.
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:24.821]  They shouldn't be the main focus.
[00:44:25.101 --> 00:44:29.124]  That's how they get you to use your energy and make you feel like you're doing something positive.
[00:44:29.504 --> 00:44:33.988]  But really, you know, there's a chance that your preacher's the demon, unfortunately.
[00:44:34.368 --> 00:44:36.370]  All right, let's go to Kenny in Wisconsin.
[00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:37.050]  Kenny, are you there?
[00:44:37.491 --> 00:44:39.052]  Yeah, Trucker Kenny here.
[00:44:39.132 --> 00:44:41.073]  Boy, I'll tell you something, Jason.
[00:44:41.133 --> 00:44:43.275]  This ain't the same country I grew up in.
[00:44:43.335 --> 00:44:45.317]  I'm a retired cross-country trucker.
[00:44:46.749 --> 00:44:48.870]  62 years old, and I'll tell you what, bud.
[00:44:49.751 --> 00:44:55.993]  Anyway, the reason I called in, Jason, I've got two websites I want the listening audience to look at.
[00:44:56.233 --> 00:44:59.335]  It's a plethora of research information.
[00:44:59.355 --> 00:45:00.175]  Okay.
[00:45:00.755 --> 00:45:07.438]  It is, the first one is refdesk.com.
[00:45:08.499 --> 00:45:09.399]  Okay, and what's the other one?
[00:45:09.915 --> 00:45:11.435]  Constitution.org.
[00:45:12.096 --> 00:45:15.756]  And what kind of material can we find on these sites?
[00:45:16.137 --> 00:45:21.078]  You're going to find everything from A to Z on RefDesk.
[00:45:21.918 --> 00:45:30.400]  And on Constitution.org, you're going to find everything Constitution-related, including Supreme Court decisions,
[00:45:31.726 --> 00:45:34.828]  The transcripts, the whole nine yards, like in D.C.
[00:45:34.908 --> 00:45:41.773]  v. Heller, you can go to the web blog on Constitution.org and you'll read the whole thing.
[00:45:42.654 --> 00:45:44.355]  All right, Kenny, I'll tell people to check it out.
[00:45:44.375 --> 00:45:45.015]  Thanks for the call.
[00:45:45.035 --> 00:45:46.936]  Let's jump to Jimmy in Tennessee.
[00:45:47.056 --> 00:45:47.897]  Jimmy, are you with us?
[00:45:49.638 --> 00:45:50.579]  Hey, what's up?
[00:45:51.239 --> 00:45:56.303]  I think I got something we could all do that could easily make an effect.
[00:45:57.452 --> 00:46:00.917]  Start actively boycotting all the six media companies.
[00:46:10.683 --> 00:46:14.986]  You start pushing your money into the alternative media that puts out that stuff.
[00:46:15.006 --> 00:46:16.127]  Well, I would just say this, man.
[00:46:16.167 --> 00:46:17.348]  It's going to be awful tough.
[00:46:17.408 --> 00:46:23.272]  I mean, I just know how hard it is to mobilize people and to wean them off mainstream entertainment.
[00:46:23.672 --> 00:46:25.494]  I mean, and we're talking about the big networks here.
[00:46:25.554 --> 00:46:27.435]  Is it going to be almost impossible?
[00:46:27.455 --> 00:46:29.797]  Well, I started doing it even to the point of like,
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:34.121]  I think the key is for us to start our own network.
[00:46:34.141 --> 00:46:37.723]  I had a real long discussion about this with Mark Dice last year.
[00:46:37.743 --> 00:46:38.603]  I wonder if he remembers it.
[00:46:53.348 --> 00:47:17.654]  But I was saying, you know, in order for us to have a chance in this thing, we are going to have to build, at least one of us out in this alternative media, some kind of a empire that is at least one-tenth or one-twentieth the size of a Fox News department or an MSNBC, only because I think we can be the David against their Goliath, but I think that we have to almost play by their rules.
[00:47:17.694 --> 00:47:18.954]  In other words, get them on TV.
[00:47:19.614 --> 00:47:27.340]  We don't even have to be organized if everyone just listening to us made a conscious effort to look on the back of their CDs and DVDs and bought like...
[00:47:27.873 --> 00:47:31.354]  The smaller studios and record labels, it would make a big difference.
[00:47:31.394 --> 00:47:33.575]  We don't have to have rubber stamps on everything.
[00:47:33.735 --> 00:47:39.418]  Unfortunately, we live in an incredible Hulk, Iron Man world where Batman's coming out.
[00:47:39.438 --> 00:47:43.259]  You know, these are the big events for some people's summer lives, man.
[00:47:43.479 --> 00:47:47.841]  It's not even like the barbecue on July 4th or spending time with their kids.
[00:47:48.121 --> 00:47:50.362]  It's, oh my God, look at this Hollywood blockbuster.
[00:47:50.602 --> 00:47:52.363]  That's how much we've fallen as a society.
[00:47:52.423 --> 00:47:53.343]  I thank you for the call.
[00:47:53.684 --> 00:47:55.965]  Let's jump to Matt in Texas.
[00:47:56.065 --> 00:47:56.545]  Matt, are you there?
[00:47:57.682 --> 00:47:57.822]  Hello?
[00:47:58.042 --> 00:47:58.723]  Hey, what's up, Matt?
[00:47:59.664 --> 00:48:00.164]  Uh, nothing.
[00:48:00.204 --> 00:48:04.808]  I actually wanted to talk to you about the Texas Republican State Convention, to which I was a delegate to.
[00:48:05.028 --> 00:48:05.368]  Okay.
[00:48:06.429 --> 00:48:10.232]  Uh, yeah, man, you know, I actually had to fight my way to the convention.
[00:48:10.272 --> 00:48:10.952]  I was an interesting thing.
[00:48:10.992 --> 00:48:14.795]  At my county convention, I managed to snatch a slot away from a cane supporter.
[00:48:15.436 --> 00:48:23.242]  But anyway, when I got there, you know, we did the whole little pre-convention thing where each district goes into its own thing and we vote our delegates out to the main convention, but
[00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:27.373]  I got up to the main convention and was just completely flabbergasted.
[00:48:27.633 --> 00:48:29.555]  The event itself was like Triumph of the Will.
[00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:34.640]  I'm still here.
[00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:35.481]  Can you hear me?
[00:48:35.621 --> 00:48:38.104]  You got the last part right?
[00:48:38.264 --> 00:48:39.245]  Yeah, Triumph of the Will.
[00:48:40.005 --> 00:48:46.632]  Oh yeah, I mean, you know, just huge telescreen, the podiums and all that were all extremely oversized.
[00:48:47.062 --> 00:48:51.286]  You know, they had a soldier come out and help everyone.
[00:48:51.346 --> 00:48:56.210]  He sang the National Anthem and everyone said the Pledge of Allegiance to Texas and the United States.
[00:48:56.310 --> 00:48:57.491]  I was like, what is this, high school?
[00:48:59.313 --> 00:49:02.576]  It was like a demented cross between a pep rally
[00:49:03.926 --> 00:49:06.047]  You know, in the Nazi rally.
[00:49:06.308 --> 00:49:13.951]  No, I watched the actual RNC from 2004, grabbing some footage for my latest flick, and it's like a cult, man.
[00:49:14.332 --> 00:49:20.475]  I mean, these people don't have a clue, they're wearing funny hats, they're pledging their allegiance to blindness, you know?
[00:49:20.715 --> 00:49:24.597]  They're pledging their allegiance to an idea that no longer exists, unfortunately.
[00:49:26.057 --> 00:49:29.539]  There is some good news is that they are slowly waking up, even among the diehards.
[00:49:29.699 --> 00:49:31.240]  I wasn't having that hard of a time of
[00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:38.112]  Trying to convince people that something was wrong and that they needed to check it out.
[00:49:38.433 --> 00:49:48.116]  Even in those circles, you guys, you know, all of us, you know, us and Ron Paul Camp and you guys down at the Alex Jones Show, you know, we're reaching these people so overturely, so we need to keep this up.
[00:49:48.536 --> 00:49:55.539]  You know, at the convention, a new organization for Houston, for Ron Paul and all this other stuff was born and, you know, we're going to try and get people together.
[00:49:57.333 --> 00:49:58.233]  Absolutely, Matt.
[00:49:58.273 --> 00:49:59.494]  We can keep pushing forward.
[00:49:59.534 --> 00:49:59.934]  I'm with you.
[00:49:59.954 --> 00:50:00.714]  I'm with the message.
[00:50:00.975 --> 00:50:02.115]  We all have great power.
[00:50:02.575 --> 00:50:04.616]  We all just have to pick an issue and decide again.
[00:50:05.316 --> 00:50:06.157]  I'm gonna do something.
[00:50:06.797 --> 00:50:07.837]  Have the will to do it.
[00:50:08.378 --> 00:50:10.078]  Alright, let's go to Mike in Tennessee.
[00:50:10.138 --> 00:50:10.759]  Mike, are you there?
[00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:14.000]  Mike, are you with us?
[00:50:15.161 --> 00:50:15.521]  Are you there?
[00:50:15.681 --> 00:50:15.881]  Yep.
[00:50:16.881 --> 00:50:23.384]  I would recommend everybody that can buy your Loose Change DVD and go to the 4th of July events around their communities
[00:50:23.993 --> 00:50:24.533]  I think so.
[00:50:42.628 --> 00:50:45.911]  We could hand that out and have references to the website and such.
[00:50:46.491 --> 00:50:50.415]  Let's see if we can't get that done sometime for PrisonPlanet.tv in the next few months.
[00:50:50.455 --> 00:50:52.176]  It's definitely some work, but not that much.
[00:50:52.497 --> 00:50:53.718]  Mike, I thank you for the call.
[00:50:53.778 --> 00:50:54.178]  I agree.
[00:50:54.218 --> 00:50:55.499]  We need to spread this message.
[00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:57.801]  July 4th is a hell of a time to do it, folks.
[00:50:58.222 --> 00:51:00.223]  And guess what comes to the InfoWar July 4th?
[00:51:00.704 --> 00:51:02.485]  The 9-11 Chronicles truth rising.
[00:51:02.525 --> 00:51:02.926]  Get ready.
[00:51:05.794 --> 00:51:07.916]  Once, America was led by real politicians.
[00:51:08.136 --> 00:51:13.039]  Now politicians in the U.S., city, county, state, and federal are owned and controlled by corporations.
[00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:15.701]  We have corporate representatives instead of politicians.
[00:51:15.922 --> 00:51:20.045]  Criminal corporate manipulation has caused grain prices to soar to the highest levels in history.
[00:51:20.205 --> 00:51:23.087]  Shortages of rice, corn, and wheat now exist in most countries.
[00:51:23.247 --> 00:51:26.489]  Natural disasters have put millions worldwide at risk of starvation.
[00:51:26.589 --> 00:51:31.453]  Food riots and red lines occur daily in 30 nations, and not only is that list growing, but it's headed this way.
[00:51:31.653 --> 00:51:35.594]  Survival Enterprises are master distributors of the highest quality long-term storage foods.

[00:55:11.079 --> 00:55:13.360]  Maybe more amazing than Pink Floyd, I don't know.
[00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:17.541]  I know I'm going to get a hell of a lot of MySpace messages about that.
[00:55:17.561 --> 00:55:18.662]  Pink Floyd's the best!
[00:55:19.362 --> 00:55:23.564]  It's Jason Burmess, and you can get at me at MySpace.com slash Jason Burmess.
[00:55:24.344 --> 00:55:26.405]  And I think Mike's idea is great, you know?
[00:55:26.505 --> 00:55:29.107]  Buy one DVD, make 50 copies, and hand them out.
[00:55:29.347 --> 00:55:31.248]  There's going to be a ton of events on July 4th.
[00:55:31.648 --> 00:55:32.728]  There's even going to be parades!
[00:55:32.768 --> 00:55:35.750]  If you're lucky enough to get on one of those parades with the candy, you know?
[00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:40.872]  What's stopping you from burning up 100 DVDs and tossing them out to the crowd?
[00:55:42.188 --> 00:55:43.729]  Label them Happy Happy Fun Time.
[00:55:43.789 --> 00:55:44.970]  I don't care what you label them.
[00:55:45.010 --> 00:55:47.711]  I just want them to stick them into the DVD player and get the truth.
[00:55:47.932 --> 00:55:48.632]  That's all I want.
[00:55:49.232 --> 00:55:52.995]  I want people to wake up so that we can restore our Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[00:55:53.415 --> 00:55:55.456]  So that we can have a government for and by the people again.
[00:55:55.496 --> 00:55:57.738]  I know I harp on this every day on the show.
[00:55:59.238 --> 00:56:00.079]  But we need to!
[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:02.380]  I'm sick of the excuses.
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:03.521]  What can I do?
[00:56:04.021 --> 00:56:04.962]  Run for City Council.
[00:56:05.802 --> 00:56:06.543]  Run for Congress.
[00:56:07.063 --> 00:56:07.944]  Run for State Senate.
[00:56:08.584 --> 00:56:09.145]  You can do it!
[00:56:09.545 --> 00:56:12.228]  Alright, we can take a couple more calls before the end of the program.
[00:56:12.268 --> 00:56:28.947]  Remember, the whole thing plays over again at InfoWars.com all four hours in case you missed Mark Dice, in case you missed Jonathan from We Are Change Colorado, in case you missed the vaccine talk, in case you missed our coverage of the Austin Governor's Mansion with somebody who works security there, in case you missed Bob Chapman.
[00:56:29.815 --> 00:56:30.776]  Or Michael Markovich.
[00:56:31.316 --> 00:56:31.856]  It's all there.
[00:56:32.677 --> 00:56:33.678]  Infowars.com.
[00:56:34.038 --> 00:56:37.500]  Alright, let's go to Tony in Illinois.
[00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:38.161]  Tony, you're with us.
[00:56:38.421 --> 00:56:39.001]  Yeah, Jason.
[00:56:39.021 --> 00:56:44.385]  Did I hear you say that these Lizzo brothers, these guys that just happened to be down?
[00:56:44.909 --> 00:56:49.113]  You know, on the street that, you know, took the first video.
[00:56:49.133 --> 00:56:50.093]  No, they're separate guys.
[00:56:50.113 --> 00:56:51.535]  You're thinking of the Naudé brothers.
[00:56:52.656 --> 00:56:54.197]  Oh, okay.
[00:56:54.217 --> 00:56:59.061]  So those guys down there had no connection with that firm that took the video.
[00:56:59.221 --> 00:57:03.124]  Now, those guys were commissioned to do a documentary on the firefighters.
[00:57:03.645 --> 00:57:04.986]  I really wonder about that.
[00:57:05.186 --> 00:57:06.207]  But anyway, just one last thing.
[00:57:06.227 --> 00:57:06.707]  I remember the 911.
[00:57:06.747 --> 00:57:07.948]  Do you realize how much equipment
[00:57:13.686 --> 00:57:16.471]  That heavy equipment, how much heavy equipment they got out there so fast.
[00:57:17.096 --> 00:57:23.961]  Well, yeah, I mean, you know, in Loose Change 2nd Edition we cover the fact that they have found those trucks underneath abandoned with gold in them.
[00:57:24.301 --> 00:57:32.747]  So someone must have told these people to get out of the trucks before they were crushed, you know, or they would have been in the trucks when they were crushed.
[00:57:32.787 --> 00:57:39.552]  I mean, they were literally taking gold out of the World Trade Center complex underground and they found these trucks abandoned underneath the World Trade Center.
[00:57:39.592 --> 00:57:40.393]  Someone had to tell them.
[00:57:40.793 --> 00:57:45.056]  How would they know when the tower was going to collapse unless they detonated it themselves?
[00:57:45.637 --> 00:57:52.733]  They had that machinery sitting over on the New Jersey side of the Hudson River waiting to come in because it was there too fast.
[00:57:53.717 --> 00:57:55.018]  It takes a while to get that.
[00:57:55.118 --> 00:57:58.239]  Well, their excuse is going to be that they were running drills, man.
[00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:00.160]  You know, they had those FEMA drills.
[00:58:00.981 --> 00:58:03.382]  They had Tripod going on, so FEMA was there.
[00:58:03.602 --> 00:58:09.245]  See, what they did is they had drills to send counterterrorism experts of the FBI outside of the country.
[00:58:09.285 --> 00:58:12.507]  They were in Monterey, California.
[00:58:12.967 --> 00:58:17.770]  But then they would also have the emergency teams ready to respond on a moment's notice.
[00:58:18.430 --> 00:58:19.930]  Because they were running a bioterror drill.
[00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:21.571]  I thank you for the call, my man.
[00:58:21.611 --> 00:58:24.871]  Remember, you can listen to all of it again over at InfoWars.com.
[00:58:24.931 --> 00:58:25.711]  I'm Jason Burmess.
