[00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.251]  Jason Bermas in studio with us.
[00:00:05.271 --> 00:00:07.032]  He'll be with us for the rest of the broadcast today.
[00:00:07.052 --> 00:00:08.172]  He's still coming up.
[00:00:08.753 --> 00:00:12.014]  Talking to Dean Barkley, SenatorBarkley.com.
[00:00:14.375 --> 00:00:15.395]  Number to their campaign, 763-417-9972.
[00:00:15.415 --> 00:00:15.475]  763-417-9972.
[00:00:15.555 --> 00:00:17.156]  Your chance to be part of history.
[00:00:17.176 --> 00:00:17.456]  Take action.
[00:00:27.892 --> 00:00:28.673]  Will it fix everything?
[00:00:28.713 --> 00:00:31.655]  Probably not, but we know if we sit on our butts, it'll only get worse.
[00:00:32.155 --> 00:00:33.716]  Think how bad it would be if we weren't taking action.
[00:00:34.577 --> 00:00:35.978]  So taking action is half the battle.
[00:00:37.258 --> 00:00:38.679]  I've got unlimited calls to take.
[00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:40.501]  We've got to let our guest go here in about five minutes.
[00:00:42.222 --> 00:00:44.583]  Let's talk to AJ in Minnesota.
[00:00:45.124 --> 00:00:46.765]  AJ in Minnesota, you're on the air.
[00:00:48.106 --> 00:00:51.248]  Yes, hey Alex Dean, it's a pleasure to be with you, a fine gentleman today.
[00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.544]  Before I get to my question here, I just wanted to say, Alex, I tuned in on the web to the concert last night and it was fantastic.
[00:00:57.584 --> 00:00:59.205]  I appreciate you getting that organized.
[00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:00.689]  You bet, you bet.
[00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:17.714]  Well really, what it was, is Willie invited us to that concert and we did some live feeds, but the whole thing was going late, it was overfilled, a whole lot of stuff on it, but we are going to have videos of us there doing interviews and doing live feeds, and some of the feeds didn't go out, but we have recordings from there, so the stuff where the web was going out on us, we're going to get up.
[00:01:18.294 --> 00:01:19.435]  But go ahead and ask your question, sir.
[00:01:19.535 --> 00:01:20.575]  Great, I'll check for it.
[00:01:20.835 --> 00:01:22.736]  Yeah, my question was to both of you.
[00:01:24.711 --> 00:01:29.873]  I don't know if you were aware of the End the Fed campaign that's being organized for November 22nd.
[00:01:30.053 --> 00:01:32.314]  Chris, I know Genesis is promoting that.
[00:01:33.274 --> 00:01:33.675]  Oh, sure.
[00:01:34.295 --> 00:01:35.275]  Running ads for it.
[00:01:35.435 --> 00:01:37.996]  Obviously, you're in support of it, Alex.
[00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:42.518]  Senator, if you were aware of that... Yeah, there's demonstrations everywhere to end the private Federal Reserve.
[00:01:43.258 --> 00:01:45.159]  Are you aware of that New World War operation, Senator?
[00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:46.360]  No, I haven't.
[00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.320]  I'm not aware of that.
[00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.622]  But I haven't many questions with anyone of what the Federal Reserve, why it was created in the first place.
[00:01:53.143 --> 00:01:57.044]  Why we gave up our currency and our treasury to a private institution.
[00:01:57.504 --> 00:02:05.966]  And I certainly am very interested in that position that you're taking, and I certainly will listen to your arguments as to why we think the Federal Reserve has to go.
[00:02:08.306 --> 00:02:09.566]  Alright, anything else, AJ?
[00:02:10.167 --> 00:02:10.487]  What's that?
[00:02:11.067 --> 00:02:12.347]  Anything else from Minnesota?
[00:02:14.547 --> 00:02:16.648]  No, that should be it.
[00:02:16.748 --> 00:02:20.809]  I plan to be out there at our regional branch here in Minneapolis on the 22nd.
[00:02:22.596 --> 00:02:33.525]  Anybody that's listening, I encourage you to get out there and support us.
[00:02:33.725 --> 00:02:36.307]  How are you doing, Alex?
[00:02:36.948 --> 00:02:42.232]  Alex, I'd like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for opening up my eyes to what's going on in this country today.
[00:02:42.852 --> 00:02:51.379]  My question, or comment really, to the Senator is, this is the first time ever I've heard of a Senator that's running for President
[00:02:51.772 --> 00:02:56.213]  To sit and talk on a regular talk show where people can actually ask them a question.
[00:02:56.373 --> 00:02:58.334]  They're running for Senate now.
[00:02:58.354 --> 00:02:58.734]  Pardon me?
[00:02:58.834 --> 00:03:00.915]  Running for Senate, yes.
[00:03:01.395 --> 00:03:04.256]  I mean, it's just nice to have that today.
[00:03:04.276 --> 00:03:07.537]  It really is.
[00:03:09.497 --> 00:03:14.459]  It's just nice for the average person to be able to reach out to a politician.
[00:03:14.895 --> 00:03:16.377]  Well, I have to wait in the long line.
[00:03:17.057 --> 00:03:20.261]  One thing I wanted to tell you, Alex.
[00:03:20.741 --> 00:03:23.624]  I live in a small community here in New Jersey.
[00:03:24.365 --> 00:03:28.029]  And believe it or not, I walked into a store that I always go in.
[00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:29.150]  It's a pharmacy.
[00:03:29.731 --> 00:03:33.455]  And believe it or not, the employees have a thumb scan on the register here now.
[00:03:34.298 --> 00:03:34.538]  No, no.
[00:03:34.578 --> 00:03:37.399]  Thumb scanners to buy and sell going in everywhere.
[00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:40.641]  This is the control grid to shut down any underground economy.
[00:03:40.681 --> 00:03:41.942]  This is total enslavement.
[00:03:42.242 --> 00:03:43.362]  Appreciate your call.
[00:03:43.923 --> 00:03:46.204]  I take it you're not for Big Brother either, Senator Barkley?
[00:03:46.884 --> 00:03:48.385]  No, I read George Orwell in 1984.
[00:03:48.485 --> 00:03:50.185]  I think that we're there.
[00:03:52.326 --> 00:03:55.568]  Well, in closing, overall, what do you think of the election this year?
[00:03:56.128 --> 00:03:57.449]  Just the presidential one.
[00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:59.270]  Well, I think we've got
[00:04:00.692 --> 00:04:02.832]  I don't know, you know, who I'm going to vote for yet.
[00:04:02.972 --> 00:04:06.353]  I think that, I was hoping that Ron Paul would have run as an independent.
[00:04:07.133 --> 00:04:09.254]  We'd have a real choice in this election right now.
[00:04:10.274 --> 00:04:16.975]  Well, he's endorsed, he's endorsed, of course, Chuck Baldwin and the Constitution Party much better than Bob Barr.
[00:04:17.675 --> 00:04:26.437]  Okay, well, you know, we do have Barr, we do have choices, and I urge people to educate themselves and take a look at who you really want.
[00:04:26.537 --> 00:04:28.017]  I mean, the horse race between
[00:04:29.692 --> 00:04:39.619]  In Obama, you know, that's not the only race going on out there, so, you know, go out and find out what these alternatives are, and if you don't like the Democrat or Republican, we'll send the message.
[00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:40.879]  Let's cram one more in.
[00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:42.600]  Jose from New York, go ahead.
[00:04:43.401 --> 00:04:44.201]  Hi, Alex.
[00:04:44.261 --> 00:04:44.502]  Hi.
[00:04:44.562 --> 00:04:53.807]  First time caller and listener for at least a year now, and I, too, am glad that you opened my eyes, too, and also an EMT in New York City and New York State.
[00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:57.730]  A question for Senator
[00:05:00.338 --> 00:05:03.440]  I just wanted to know, did you hear of the Codex Elementaris?
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.362]  I haven't heard of that issue, so I don't want to pretend I know.
[00:05:06.382 --> 00:05:06.422]  No.
[00:05:06.442 --> 00:05:06.682]  No, we're not.
[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:22.840]  Well, sir, it's been an amazing interview.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:31.343]  Let me get you back up once the ads are running, maybe Friday or something, as we go into the last days of this key election for a quick update.
[00:05:31.743 --> 00:05:36.844]  And again, the website is senatorbarkley.com, 763-417-9972.
[00:05:36.904 --> 00:05:37.845]  Thank you so much, sir.
[00:05:38.485 --> 00:05:42.086]  Well, thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak to you.
[00:05:42.685 --> 00:05:42.966]  You bet.
[00:05:42.986 --> 00:05:45.309]  It was great having you here and we will talk to you very soon.
[00:05:45.329 --> 00:05:46.511]  I'll say bye to you here off air.
[00:05:46.531 --> 00:05:48.393]  We'll be right back with Jason Berman, Stella Costello.
[00:05:48.413 --> 00:05:48.794]  Stay with us.
[00:05:48.814 --> 00:05:49.815]  More calls.
[00:05:50.516 --> 00:05:51.918]  You're certainly aware of that going on.
[00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:52.239]  Yeah.
[00:05:53.621 --> 00:05:55.103]  Well, sir, it's been an amazing interview.
[00:05:55.123 --> 00:05:56.245]  Let me get you back up.
[00:05:57.266 --> 00:06:03.570]  Once the ads are running, maybe Friday or something, as we go into the last days of this key election, for a quick update.
[00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:09.053]  And again, the website is senatorbarkley.com 763-417-9972.
[00:06:09.153 --> 00:06:10.074]  Thank you so much, sir.
[00:06:10.654 --> 00:06:14.457]  Well, thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak to your listeners.
[00:06:14.917 --> 00:06:15.197]  You bet.
[00:06:15.217 --> 00:06:17.538]  It was great having you here, and we will talk to you very soon.
[00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:18.759]  I'll say bye to you here off-air.
[00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:20.620]  We'll be right back with Jason Burma, Celica Stillo.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.041]  Stay with us.
[00:06:21.061 --> 00:06:21.421]  More calls.
[00:06:21.721 --> 00:06:22.622]  We're on the march.
[00:06:23.102 --> 00:06:24.623]  The empire's on the run.
[00:06:25.624 --> 00:06:28.309]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:06:32.361 --> 00:06:36.264]  Would you like to know how you can use water as fuel and laugh at the rising price of gas?
[00:06:36.724 --> 00:06:38.785]  Then keep listening for a very special offer.

[00:07:23.334 --> 00:07:23.734]  Call today.
[00:07:31.633 --> 00:07:34.675]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:07:34.815 --> 00:07:37.176]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:07:37.196 --> 00:07:38.397]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:07:38.457 --> 00:07:39.977]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:07:40.017 --> 00:07:41.598]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:07:41.718 --> 00:07:44.540]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.222]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR.
[00:07:57.887 --> 00:08:02.801]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:08:10.613 --> 00:08:14.034]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:08:14.054 --> 00:08:16.835]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:08:16.935 --> 00:08:23.357]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[00:08:23.417 --> 00:08:25.998]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[00:08:26.258 --> 00:08:28.279]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:08:28.519 --> 00:08:31.000]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:36.091]  You know, I know exactly what you're thinking when it comes to this economy.
[00:08:36.211 --> 00:08:37.491]  The banks are crashing.
[00:08:37.591 --> 00:08:39.092]  The stock market's a mess.
[00:08:39.192 --> 00:08:40.692]  There's the mortgage crisis.
[00:08:40.852 --> 00:08:42.633]  There's the lending crisis.
[00:08:42.793 --> 00:08:47.194]  There is the food and gasoline prices through the ceiling crisis.
[00:08:47.454 --> 00:08:48.995]  And we are paralyzed a little bit.
[00:08:49.015 --> 00:08:50.815]  We don't know exactly how to respond to it.
[00:08:50.995 --> 00:08:51.795]  I don't know what to say.
[00:08:52.016 --> 00:08:52.576]  What can you do?
[00:08:52.596 --> 00:08:53.416]  Do what you can do.
[00:08:53.456 --> 00:08:53.996]  That's what you do.
[00:08:54.056 --> 00:08:54.956]  You do what you can do.
[00:08:54.976 --> 00:08:56.897]  What I can do is I can put some food away.
[00:08:56.997 --> 00:08:58.577]  I know there's a global food shortage.
[00:08:58.778 --> 00:08:59.278]  I can read it.
[00:08:59.318 --> 00:09:00.058]  I can go to eFoods.
[00:09:08.191 --> 00:09:11.773]  We are live at PrisonPlanet.tv for the rest of the broadcast.
[00:09:11.793 --> 00:09:17.336]  This man, here on your screen, Jason Burmiss, is riding shotgun with us.
[00:09:18.176 --> 00:09:19.857]  Burmiss, you lived down here for what, five months?
[00:09:20.257 --> 00:09:20.778]  About four.
[00:09:20.838 --> 00:09:21.838]  About four, four and a half, yeah.
[00:09:22.118 --> 00:09:28.762]  Yeah, it was really great having you down here, and it's like old times to have you back, and we're just now about to move the next week or so out of this office.
[00:09:28.782 --> 00:09:34.025]  We're building the radio studio and the TV studio, and it's trying to save money and order stuff.
[00:09:34.645 --> 00:09:40.328]  You know, off eBay and stuff for the parts, because we couldn't afford it if we bought even the low-grade stuff for real TV studios.
[00:09:41.208 --> 00:09:43.949]  On radio, we've got some decent equipment, but that's getting built up.
[00:09:43.969 --> 00:09:44.510]  That's happening.
[00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:45.970]  Have we given you a tour of the new office yet?
[00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:51.473]  Yeah, I was actually down there the last day that I was here, before I flew out.
[00:09:51.773 --> 00:09:55.355]  I went down there and I was with Tim's sister and I got the whole tour, the whole place.
[00:09:55.535 --> 00:09:56.255]  It's exciting, Alex.
[00:09:56.275 --> 00:09:57.355]  But now it's all filled up.
[00:09:57.395 --> 00:09:59.096]  Yeah, it's like 7,800 square feet.
[00:09:59.136 --> 00:09:59.356]  This is 2,200.
[00:09:59.396 --> 00:10:01.017]  Yeah, I haven't been in here in a while.
[00:10:01.057 --> 00:10:02.398]  We're cramming here like sardines.
[00:10:03.198 --> 00:10:05.539]  And we have another little satellite office because this wasn't big enough.
[00:10:05.559 --> 00:10:06.440]  We're getting rid of both of these.
[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:07.400]  We just got rid of the other one.
[00:10:07.641 --> 00:10:08.421]  We're getting rid of this one.
[00:10:08.881 --> 00:10:10.362]  And thanks to everybody's support out there.
[00:10:11.062 --> 00:10:21.968]  I want to go to phone calls and talk about all the insane news here today, but I was going to have you just do the show today, but then Ventura's like, let's get Dean on.
[00:10:22.008 --> 00:10:22.869]  Let's try to help him.
[00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:24.249]  And so I came in.
[00:10:24.269 --> 00:10:25.110]  I'm not trying to be a wimp.
[00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:26.170]  I'm not like Ventura, man.
[00:10:26.371 --> 00:10:28.572]  Three hours sleeping for two days of tiring shooting.
[00:10:29.512 --> 00:10:30.293]  I'm fried right now.
[00:10:31.141 --> 00:10:33.203]  I mean, I am just really, really tired right now.
[00:10:33.243 --> 00:10:34.864]  How good does it feel to get that response?
[00:10:34.904 --> 00:10:38.487]  I mean, he said his phone's off the hook, the website's all over the place.
[00:10:38.527 --> 00:10:40.629]  You might help this guy win a one-in-a-hundred election.
[00:10:40.649 --> 00:10:43.091]  You know, I mean, we only have two senators per state.
[00:10:43.111 --> 00:10:44.052]  This is a huge election.
[00:10:44.072 --> 00:10:47.095]  To get an independent on the Senate floor would be very big.
[00:10:47.415 --> 00:10:48.776]  So I hope this continues all day.
[00:10:48.816 --> 00:10:53.420]  I know you're rebroadcast all day on AM and FM, shortwave, of course, on the Internet.
[00:10:53.961 --> 00:10:54.901]  I don't want people to let up.
[00:10:55.042 --> 00:10:56.203]  You know, let's get this guy elected.
[00:10:56.463 --> 00:10:58.565]  At least we'll have one win in this election season.
[00:10:59.045 --> 00:11:00.286]  Well, it's the will to resist.
[00:11:00.526 --> 00:11:18.854]  And of course there's election fraud, but I found in Minnesota, and I've studied the states, we've had all the voting experts on, Florida's real bad, California's real bad, New York, New Hampshire, all those key states, but Minnesota has some electronic machines, some fraud, but the people are so involved there with, you heard him, 80-something percent highest voter turnout in the country on average.
[00:11:18.894 --> 00:11:19.934]  I mean, they're really active there.
[00:11:19.954 --> 00:11:25.736]  They've had a lot of problems putting in their fraudulent systems, and that's why we've been seeing some independents and people get in there.
[00:11:27.998 --> 00:11:33.963]  The video, the problem is we have three cameras that shot about three and a half hours of footage at Willie's house.
[00:11:34.264 --> 00:11:36.125]  We were there about four, but we shot for three and a half hours.
[00:11:38.467 --> 00:11:40.489]  We had some behind the scenes discussions we didn't want to tape.
[00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:52.019]  So imagine we have all those tapes, then we have about two hours to tape per camera, three cameras, with Ventura driving around in the days he was here, day and a half he was here, or a little more than a day and a half.
[00:11:52.059 --> 00:11:53.721]  Point is, it came in Saturday, left today.
[00:11:54.641 --> 00:11:57.003]  All this going on, that we're going to get this up for everybody.
[00:11:57.023 --> 00:11:59.765]  People are like, oh yeah, interesting Willie Nelson and Ventura and Alex Jones.
[00:11:59.805 --> 00:12:01.726]  No, there's some incredible stuff.
[00:12:02.566 --> 00:12:04.968]  Now, some of it was off-record, we're not going to get into.
[00:12:04.988 --> 00:12:07.009]  I guess the cameras were off, so it doesn't matter.
[00:12:07.029 --> 00:12:09.911]  But without getting into too much of what's going on and some of the things Ventura and I are
[00:12:10.411 --> 00:12:15.554]  Absolutely, and to have Willie Nelson sit there with an independent like Jesse Ventura and really a maverick like yourself
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.962]  And discuss the issues that still matter.
[00:12:32.982 --> 00:12:34.723]  9-11 still matters.
[00:12:35.023 --> 00:12:36.484]  This presidential election still matters.
[00:12:36.504 --> 00:12:39.526]  Talk about the bailout with us and that criminal enterprise.
[00:12:39.566 --> 00:12:43.388]  We talked about farming and how they've made that into a criminal enterprise.
[00:12:43.428 --> 00:12:45.870]  So, you know, it was just so awesome, Alex.
[00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:46.770]  I mean, this is an icon.
[00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:48.691]  This is somebody who's not going to be around forever.
[00:12:48.751 --> 00:12:50.752]  I mean, Willie's 75 years old, you know.
[00:12:51.873 --> 00:12:55.578]  We will make these interviews live on forever, and that's what's great about what we do.
[00:12:55.618 --> 00:13:01.345]  You know, our work will live on far beyond, you know, Alex Jones, Jason Bermas, Jesse Ventura, Willie Nelson.
[00:13:01.805 --> 00:13:09.014]  And to have somebody with that much influence, I mean, you saw those people going crazy for him last night when he was on stage, 6,000 people roaring for Willie Nelson.
[00:13:09.835 --> 00:13:13.678]  More like probably 60 million worldwide that listen to what he has to say.
[00:13:13.758 --> 00:13:16.940]  So, I'm so stoked what we've been able to accomplish in the last two days.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.903]  I'm so excited to put this out for other people to listen to, to other people to see.
[00:13:20.923 --> 00:13:23.885]  And when you see, again, how this man lives, you won't believe it.
[00:13:24.085 --> 00:13:25.786]  I mean, it's a real modest living.
[00:13:25.846 --> 00:13:31.570]  And by the way, I was like, you're sure you want us to take cameras in your house, in your bedroom, in your back rooms, you know, in your... And he was like, come on.
[00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:32.931]  Yeah, he's like, just come on in.
[00:13:32.991 --> 00:13:33.871]  No, everything's good.
[00:13:33.931 --> 00:13:34.972]  I don't care if you roll.
[00:13:34.992 --> 00:13:35.732]  And I was just like, wow.
[00:13:36.633 --> 00:13:38.094]  And he had that awesome balcony.
[00:13:38.114 --> 00:13:41.998]  I mean, I guess some people have seen some of the pictures that we put up so they can see that skyline.
[00:13:42.398 --> 00:13:43.839]  But it's really incredible, man.
[00:13:43.899 --> 00:13:45.621]  He's got all these hills and mountains all around him.
[00:13:45.661 --> 00:13:46.522]  He's up on top of it.
[00:13:46.642 --> 00:13:48.123]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:13:48.143 --> 00:13:52.087]  The point is, it's always great to be up on a big vista with Willie Nelson and Jesse Ventura.
[00:13:52.247 --> 00:13:59.353]  Yeah, and Nelson talking about how, again, at that age, how he's on 200 venues a year, live, and then working even more than that.
[00:13:59.393 --> 00:14:00.654]  And making two or three movies a year.
[00:14:00.694 --> 00:14:01.395]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:14:01.435 --> 00:14:05.839]  And he's even built his own little kind of like a western studio place.
[00:14:05.899 --> 00:14:13.707]  It's kind of like you're going into one of those old villages and then he's got... They built it in the 70s and because it's old churches and real old buildings they brought in from all over Texas.
[00:14:14.547 --> 00:14:16.649]  It's like you're in the real deal with the weeds growing up.
[00:14:16.689 --> 00:14:18.151]  I mean it's not like it's even a fake town.
[00:14:18.211 --> 00:14:20.733]  Yeah, Jesse Ventura said it was like being in Gunsmoke.
[00:14:20.773 --> 00:14:23.896]  He was just waiting for somebody to walk out of the saloon and take out their six-shooter.
[00:14:24.897 --> 00:14:25.877]  I thought that was great.
[00:14:25.897 --> 00:14:28.298]  You know, it was just an incredible time.
[00:14:28.338 --> 00:14:31.359]  We're sitting there, we're looking at the red-headed stranger poster.
[00:14:31.759 --> 00:14:34.379]  We're looking at just Willie throughout the years in the background.
[00:14:34.399 --> 00:14:35.740]  He doesn't really care about himself.
[00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:39.421]  I mean, he's just listening to a little radio and hanging out behind the bar.
[00:14:39.461 --> 00:14:40.921]  It was just the coolest thing ever.
[00:14:41.181 --> 00:14:43.242]  I mean, how about the shot of him on the lawnmower?
[00:14:43.562 --> 00:14:44.562]  You know, he just did that.
[00:14:44.582 --> 00:14:46.343]  He just suddenly jumps out of the truck.
[00:14:46.583 --> 00:14:48.423]  Me and Willie riding around in his truck.
[00:14:48.483 --> 00:14:49.843]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:14:49.883 --> 00:14:51.824]  And he looked like he was having a grand old time.
[00:14:52.424 --> 00:14:57.687]  You see the last video he shot with Woody Harrelson was all up at his house and he has a little track race.
[00:14:57.867 --> 00:14:59.107]  We even got to meet some of his family.
[00:14:59.127 --> 00:15:00.248]  They were very nice people.
[00:15:00.328 --> 00:15:02.929]  I mean, what an experience, folks.
[00:15:02.989 --> 00:15:03.850]  I mean, what an experience.
[00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:07.452]  And the way Jesse was mobbed when we actually went to the backyard in the back, I mean...
[00:15:08.072 --> 00:15:15.037]  You couldn't walk five feet without somebody coming up to Ventura and being, oh Jesse, can I get a... I need a picture right now, Jesse, I love what you do.
[00:15:15.198 --> 00:15:18.620]  And I mean, just as an indicator of how far our movement's gone, we were mobbed by the people.
[00:15:18.961 --> 00:15:20.622]  Not just in the front, but in the backstage.
[00:15:20.702 --> 00:15:22.163]  Oh yeah, there were plenty of people coming up to you.
[00:15:22.223 --> 00:15:22.884]  Myself included, yeah.
[00:15:22.904 --> 00:15:25.366]  Oh yeah, people, Alex, I love what you do, thank you so much.
[00:15:25.386 --> 00:15:26.907]  So the shows were really having an effect.
[00:15:27.027 --> 00:15:28.888]  And the thing is, people have to get ready to win.
[00:15:28.908 --> 00:15:35.593]  You have to get ready for us to get Best Actress this year, and German defense ministers, and an Italian former president.
[00:15:36.434 --> 00:15:41.378]  And Hollywood people, and Bruce Willis, and Rick Linklater, and Naomi Wolf, all these mainline liberals.
[00:15:41.418 --> 00:15:42.679]  We have to be ready to win.
[00:15:43.059 --> 00:15:44.981]  We have to be ready to wake up conservatives and liberals.
[00:15:45.001 --> 00:15:47.683]  We have to be ready to have icons come to our aid.
[00:15:48.224 --> 00:15:51.787]  Because that's showing their courage to speak out.
[00:15:52.287 --> 00:15:54.248]  And I have to say, some of Willie's folks are scared.
[00:15:55.029 --> 00:15:55.810]  Of what he's doing with us.
[00:15:56.030 --> 00:16:00.273]  He's been death-threatened quite a bit for coming on this show and he hasn't given in to it.
[00:16:01.454 --> 00:16:03.195]  But some of the people around him don't like it.
[00:16:03.675 --> 00:16:05.236]  And so that's something that has to be understood too.
[00:16:05.276 --> 00:16:10.420]  There are people out there that are doing everything they can to stop this information from coming out.
[00:16:11.181 --> 00:16:13.622]  We've been getting a lot of death threats here at the office lately.
[00:16:14.423 --> 00:16:16.605]  And some people are even signing their names onto them.
[00:16:16.665 --> 00:16:20.928]  And we're so busy fighting the New World Order that we're not even stopping to deal with that.
[00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:32.952]  Everything that's happening is so exciting, and I know folks are really chomping at the bit to see all these behind-the-scenes videos, because that's the key.
[00:16:33.373 --> 00:16:38.794]  Also, the live little speeches we did there, some of the reports we did from the venue, so that is all coming up.
[00:16:39.054 --> 00:16:42.115]  Burmus, you never turn your cell phone off when you come in the studio.
[00:16:42.195 --> 00:16:42.355]  I try.
[00:16:42.455 --> 00:16:44.196]  But you're like holding it instead of turning it off.
[00:16:44.216 --> 00:16:46.756]  Just take it out and turn it off.
[00:16:46.956 --> 00:16:47.617]  Turning it off, sir.
[00:16:48.017 --> 00:16:50.337]  I know it's radical to say turn your cell phone off.
[00:16:50.717 --> 00:16:51.538]  Hey, look at mine.
[00:16:51.898 --> 00:16:52.478]  It's turned off.
[00:16:53.191 --> 00:16:53.871]  See, mine's busted.
[00:16:53.931 --> 00:16:54.511]  It's hard to turn off.
[00:16:54.551 --> 00:16:55.051]  All right, there we go.
[00:16:55.131 --> 00:16:55.471]  Got it done.
[00:16:58.632 --> 00:16:59.512]  Oh, give me that.
[00:16:59.532 --> 00:17:01.412]  You got my cell phone, good sir.
[00:17:02.573 --> 00:17:04.793]  Put these on both sides of my head and cook my brain up.
[00:17:05.493 --> 00:17:09.454]  How about Jesse Ventura refusing to carry a cell phone?
[00:17:09.474 --> 00:17:09.934]  I love the government.
[00:17:09.994 --> 00:17:11.174]  I love the New World Order.
[00:17:11.794 --> 00:17:13.435]  Ah, the government's good.
[00:17:13.455 --> 00:17:14.115]  They never lie.
[00:17:14.175 --> 00:17:15.175]  Everything's fine.
[00:17:15.595 --> 00:17:20.536]  Sure, they're talking about martial law all over the news and rioting and police state, but it's safe.
[00:17:20.716 --> 00:17:21.836]  Oh, the government loves me.
[00:17:24.037 --> 00:17:26.239]  I'm going to keep this for the duration of the broadcast.
[00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:30.362]  Like the teacher, I'm going to sit it right over here.
[00:17:30.523 --> 00:17:32.885]  You want this!
[00:17:33.065 --> 00:17:34.946]  Take me and strike me down with it!
[00:17:35.507 --> 00:17:36.428]  All of your power!
[00:17:36.848 --> 00:17:38.449]  It's hard not to be hooked in, Alex.
[00:17:38.489 --> 00:17:45.215]  I mean, I guess I kind of envy Ventura because he won't carry around a cell phone, but how is anyone going to get in touch with that man while he's down in Mexico?
[00:17:45.515 --> 00:17:46.456]  I guess it's just not going to happen.
[00:17:46.476 --> 00:17:46.936]  That's the plan.
[00:17:47.016 --> 00:17:48.257]  Yeah, I know that is the plan.
[00:17:48.297 --> 00:17:48.758]  Good for him.
[00:17:49.158 --> 00:17:50.199]  I can't leave society.
[00:17:50.279 --> 00:17:51.000]  I know where he lives now.
[00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:51.940]  Oh yeah, that's right.
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:55.841]  We talked about his whole deal, and dude, again, just awesome.
[00:17:55.961 --> 00:18:02.502]  I mean, Jesse Ventura's talking about how he's powering his whole home down there by solar energy, you know, getting off the grid.
[00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:04.322]  And again, people say, oh, who cares about celebrities?
[00:18:04.342 --> 00:18:05.403]  Well, the point is, the culture does.
[00:18:05.443 --> 00:18:06.023]  They're mad with it.
[00:18:06.043 --> 00:18:06.843]  They're obsessed with it.
[00:18:07.123 --> 00:18:13.424]  And to have big celebrities coming out for 9-11 Truth, coming out against the war, coming out against the New World Order, that is the shift in society.
[00:18:13.824 --> 00:18:15.064]  And the establishment is scared.
[00:18:15.104 --> 00:18:18.485]  And then, to find out that, you know, Jesse Ventura is so real, too.
[00:18:19.005 --> 00:18:24.473]  I mean, I know a lot of celebrities and these are two super genuine guys compared to most celebrities.
[00:18:24.513 --> 00:18:25.634]  I mean, just so real.
[00:18:26.355 --> 00:18:27.957]  And it's not just one time.
[00:18:28.178 --> 00:18:29.519]  They didn't just come on your show one time.
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.342]  They keep pressing the issue.
[00:18:31.582 --> 00:18:33.906]  And there continues to be other people that aren't just celebrities.
[00:18:34.406 --> 00:18:34.867]  For instance,
[00:18:36.008 --> 00:18:40.473]  Who is it, the Japanese parliamentary member, what is it, Fujita, I believe his name is?
[00:18:40.493 --> 00:18:40.614]  Yeah.
[00:18:40.754 --> 00:18:49.083]  He just went again and did a 25 minute speech before Parliament on 9-11 Truth and he keeps pressing that issue in Japan and that is very important.
[00:18:49.103 --> 00:18:50.645]  And he's one of the top leaders in his party.
[00:18:50.785 --> 00:18:52.326]  That's right, and it's the opposition party.
[00:18:52.346 --> 00:18:59.451]  It's one of the two main parties over there, and for him to get up in front of those politicians and say what he's saying is so beneficial to our movement.
[00:18:59.471 --> 00:19:05.055]  It gives us a global credibility that we're going to need to topple these tyrants, you know?
[00:19:05.235 --> 00:19:08.498]  We need more people in governments around the world to start talking about this.
[00:19:08.658 --> 00:19:11.039]  We need more celebrities to start talking about this.
[00:19:11.099 --> 00:19:18.665]  We need more mainline talk show hosts to start talking about this stuff, and I think Jesse Ventura, Willie Nelson, Charlie Sheen,
[00:19:18.945 --> 00:19:22.547]  Rosie O'Donnell, these are great ways to get it out, because they do have that influence.
[00:19:22.587 --> 00:19:30.532]  And it creates a big media circus, which then people hear about 9-11 Truth, they hear about government-sponsored terror, and by exposing, well that was seven years ago.
[00:19:30.592 --> 00:19:38.637]  If we don't expose 9-11, at least in the public mind, you know, much less convictions, then they will continue to carry it out over and over again.
[00:19:38.697 --> 00:19:40.358]  They continue to use it to take your freedoms.
[00:19:40.438 --> 00:19:43.439]  That's right, and it's not like 9-11 is an isolated incident.
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:47.422]  We know the 7-7 bombings in Europe, in London,
[00:19:48.683 --> 00:19:53.149]  Had drills going on at the same exact time of the same exact train stations being blown up.
[00:19:53.469 --> 00:19:54.831]  I mean, is that a coincidence, Alex?
[00:19:54.871 --> 00:19:56.193]  Of course it's not a coincidence.
[00:19:56.654 --> 00:20:03.363]  And the real key to that not being a coincidence, and this being more state-sponsored terror to control people, to instill fear in people,
[00:20:03.883 --> 00:20:06.244]  To grab onto your liberties and freedoms.
[00:20:06.264 --> 00:20:23.748]  You had a member of these drills, a member of Visor Consultants, Peter Powers, someone who was not in the loop, getting on Sky Television and the BBC, and new listeners can check this out, saying that the hair on the back of his neck is standing up right now because at the exact same time they were running drills of blowing up the exact same train stations.
[00:20:24.168 --> 00:20:28.531]  And the BBC guy that follows up on it goes, that is an incredible coincidence.
[00:20:28.551 --> 00:20:30.553]  He's like, yes, it is an incredible coincidence.
[00:20:30.973 --> 00:20:37.818]  And then last year, because of people like you and myself, We Are Change, which is now a global institution.
[00:20:38.038 --> 00:20:39.479]  I mean, if you want it, you got it.
[00:20:39.899 --> 00:20:41.300]  You can go up to a politician.
[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:43.982]  You can go up to somebody who is a corporate entity.
[00:20:44.002 --> 00:20:45.843]  You can go up to one of these elites and ask a question.
[00:20:46.244 --> 00:20:50.367]  We Are Change Ireland, in a country far, far away, finds Peter Powers.
[00:20:51.127 --> 00:20:55.810]  Ask him who he's going to run the drills for, who he was running the drills for, and the man walks into a closet, Alex.
[00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:57.731]  He walks not into another room.
[00:20:57.751 --> 00:20:58.211]  He was hiding.
[00:20:58.471 --> 00:20:59.272]  In a closet!
[00:20:59.652 --> 00:21:05.215]  If that doesn't scream guilt, and that's just, those are just two instances that we can prove in the last two years.
[00:21:05.235 --> 00:21:17.803]  By the way, Nis has had to admit now that the North Tower didn't fall into the South Tower, didn't knock out 25 or 30 percent of it, but Jesse's doing, well I don't want to get into it, the point is he's going around confronting all these people, and they're still just spewing the same bull.
[00:21:18.143 --> 00:21:18.963]  That's right, that's right.
[00:21:19.023 --> 00:21:20.124]  It's the same talking points.
[00:21:20.144 --> 00:21:21.704]  Man, I know so much I can't talk about here.
[00:21:22.184 --> 00:21:24.165]  Well, you know, I mean, I still... A lot of exciting stuff.
[00:21:24.305 --> 00:21:26.466]  I still get those talking points, too.
[00:21:26.486 --> 00:21:30.107]  Oh, 25% of the back face of World Trade Center 7 was scooped out.
[00:21:30.187 --> 00:21:31.307]  And we have video, isn't it?
[00:21:31.387 --> 00:21:31.847]  And it's not!
[00:21:32.047 --> 00:21:33.748]  We have video inside the building!
[00:21:33.788 --> 00:21:35.468]  And now NIST has retracted that.
[00:21:35.548 --> 00:21:36.529]  Yeah, they absolutely have.
[00:21:36.589 --> 00:21:43.131]  And now these big firms, institutions, and big architecture institutes are coming out and saying, we've read your report, this is impossible.
[00:21:43.331 --> 00:21:43.471]  Yeah.
[00:21:43.751 --> 00:21:46.072]  I mean, again, the debunkers
[00:21:47.392 --> 00:21:50.854]  Count on people being stupid and not looking deeper.
[00:21:51.314 --> 00:21:55.556]  They just count on putting out disinformation and that isn't working anymore.
[00:21:55.736 --> 00:21:57.277]  No, that's absolutely right.
[00:21:57.937 --> 00:22:00.138]  Let me give you an example of what they do.
[00:22:00.439 --> 00:22:03.580]  Okay, they just make a claim that is completely untrue and then run with it.
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:10.403]  For instance, one of the big debunkers claims is that the military drills that morning immediately ended as soon as the real attacks happened.
[00:22:10.684 --> 00:22:14.285]  And they just spew this, they give no evidence, but we have the NORAD tapes, Alex.
[00:22:14.305 --> 00:22:15.086]  These drills went on
[00:22:15.566 --> 00:22:23.212]  All morning long, at least through Flight 93 going down, and then when they called into Cheyenne Mountain, it took another 20 to 25 minutes for them to shut these drills down.
[00:22:23.432 --> 00:22:24.052]  That's all morning.
[00:22:24.393 --> 00:22:26.194]  That's not 845 they stopped.
[00:22:26.274 --> 00:22:32.498]  But that doesn't matter, because whenever I talk to a debunker, they say right away, Oh, well they put those drills on hold at 845.
[00:22:32.799 --> 00:22:33.179]  That ended.
[00:22:33.219 --> 00:22:33.799]  That's not real.
[00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:35.801]  There was no hijacking drills that morning.
[00:22:36.061 --> 00:22:45.229]  When you can look at the door at Games, Vigilant Guardian, Vigilant Warrior, Apollo Guardian, Global Guardian, and they're running live hijack drills.
[00:22:45.269 --> 00:22:57.179]  They're running a mass Armageddon exercise where E4Bs, in other words, Mobile Command Centers, for the quote-unquote shadow government or continuity of government program, just happen to be on the scene of the attacks!
[00:22:57.399 --> 00:23:02.743]  Now Burmese, I want to add something here before we get into some other news and take phone calls before Stella Costello joins us.
[00:23:03.584 --> 00:23:06.085]  You're wanting to do a radio show again.
[00:23:06.105 --> 00:23:09.046]  You've been so busy making Fabled Enemies that you quit your Genesis show for a while.
[00:23:09.826 --> 00:23:14.267]  And we're moving into the other studio, but I don't have the people hired to do the video in.
[00:23:14.287 --> 00:23:15.628]  You're going to do a show over Genesis.
[00:23:16.168 --> 00:23:18.088]  I have no desire to get involved with a radio network.
[00:23:18.128 --> 00:23:19.409]  I'm so tired of people telling me that.
[00:23:19.429 --> 00:23:20.189]  There's no way!
[00:23:20.689 --> 00:23:24.993]  I would try to get involved in managing all those personalities and dealing with all of it, but I want to get your show back on Genesis.
[00:23:25.293 --> 00:23:30.798]  It will also be streamed on PrisonPlanet.tv, and so look for that in the next few months.
[00:23:31.498 --> 00:23:35.922]  You're building your studio, you're going to have a nice little area there and do a two-hour show.
[00:23:36.282 --> 00:23:37.964]  We're not sure about what time to do it.
[00:23:40.206 --> 00:23:47.932]  We had talked about this in the past, so Jason Bermas will be coming back on the airwaves in the next few months, but let's not procrastinate forever and then not have it happen.
[00:23:49.173 --> 00:23:55.556]  The other variant of that, it's also going to be on the web at PrisonPlanet.tv, and you're building us a TV studio.
[00:23:55.596 --> 00:23:57.597]  The screen's behind you, you know, video feeds.
[00:23:57.717 --> 00:23:59.158]  I'm very, I'm blessed, Alex.
[00:23:59.238 --> 00:24:04.220]  And then our new studio, you know, not just for the TV show, I'm going to do nationally, that's only one hour a week starting.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.422]  Then also do, you know, web reports from the nice setup and everything.
[00:24:07.862 --> 00:24:16.406]  But we're going to have a studio for radio, it's got little robotic cameras and a big back screen and curtains, and we're just going to have a podium too where I can give speeches or have announcements.
[00:24:16.846 --> 00:24:18.067]  I mean, it's pretty kick-butt.
[00:24:18.127 --> 00:24:22.792]  I really believe we're going to give the mainstream media a hell of a run for their money, and they're not even going to see it coming.
[00:24:22.992 --> 00:24:24.013]  I mean, I really do.
[00:24:24.073 --> 00:24:30.379]  I mean, our studios are going to look slick, hopefully our presentation is going to be bigger than ever, and more people are going to be pulled into this, Alex.
[00:24:30.419 --> 00:24:32.220]  I mean, you've done so much already.
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:38.106]  And folks, we would do this faster, but when you're busy working 16, 17 hours, I mean, more or less.
[00:24:38.266 --> 00:24:39.807]  Hell, last night I got up at 7.
[00:24:40.828 --> 00:24:44.492]  When we had breakfast with Ventura, we went there and got ready and met him for breakfast at 9.
[00:24:45.192 --> 00:24:48.175]  I got up at like really 6.30, left the house at 7, came and met with you guys at 8.
[00:24:49.436 --> 00:24:53.720]  And we went and then last night I dropped him off at 12.30 and we came back here to the office to work some more.
[00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:54.661]  Then I went home.
[00:24:55.502 --> 00:24:56.002]  A 20 hour day?
[00:24:56.082 --> 00:24:56.963]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:24:57.163 --> 00:24:59.586]  And then I couldn't help myself, I had to go look up
[00:25:00.426 --> 00:25:03.848]  This Dean Barclay, a Barclay candidate on the web.
[00:25:03.928 --> 00:25:07.070]  I mean, literally, we're burning with the passion for liberty and freedom.
[00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:08.391]  And people ask how we can work so much.
[00:25:08.671 --> 00:25:09.571]  Because we have passion.
[00:25:09.611 --> 00:25:11.152]  And folks, you've got that same passion.
[00:25:11.492 --> 00:25:13.434]  You've just got to put it into effect in small ways.
[00:25:13.474 --> 00:25:13.994]  It will build.
[00:25:14.014 --> 00:25:17.056]  Whether you're a radio show online that has ten listeners, or a million, you know.
[00:25:18.717 --> 00:25:22.859]  The point is taking action or using AXS TV or Micro-FM.
[00:25:22.879 --> 00:25:25.920]  More people need to put up Micro-FM and put on some of these networks.
[00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:29.382]  I mean, there's so much, but you were talking about something when I interrupted you.
[00:25:29.502 --> 00:25:30.362]  No, that's okay, Alex.
[00:25:30.402 --> 00:25:33.784]  I mean, again, I really think we're going to give the mainstream media a run for their money.
[00:25:33.824 --> 00:25:34.764]  I think we're going to be slick.
[00:25:35.145 --> 00:25:42.508]  You've done such a great job with your PrisonPlanet.tv fourth hour on the air show in the last, what's only been on, what, about six, seven months, not even?
[00:25:42.688 --> 00:25:42.888]  Yeah.
[00:25:43.008 --> 00:25:44.009]  I mean, that's so huge.
[00:25:44.049 --> 00:25:48.431]  I mean, you see it every day and it's getting 10, 15, 20,000 hits on YouTube.
[00:25:48.451 --> 00:25:49.251]  That's awesome.
[00:25:49.412 --> 00:25:50.032]  Yeah, let's explain.
[00:25:50.052 --> 00:25:52.133]  The members get the live stream and the higher quality.
[00:25:52.373 --> 00:25:53.374]  Without it, we couldn't operate.
[00:25:53.554 --> 00:25:56.155]  You folks aren't just getting the higher quality streams and videos.
[00:25:56.195 --> 00:25:57.756]  You are making it possible here.
[00:25:57.796 --> 00:26:00.858]  And then we love the members ripping and getting it all over the map.
[00:26:00.878 --> 00:26:02.699]  But the great guy over at the Alex Jones Channel,
[00:26:03.699 --> 00:26:04.400]  Which is not us.
[00:26:04.901 --> 00:26:05.822]  I mean, we're not control freaks.
[00:26:05.842 --> 00:26:07.924]  He tried to give us the channel, and we're like, you know.
[00:26:08.244 --> 00:26:12.930]  But the more I think about it, maybe we should, just so some other cretin doesn't get in and attack us, because, you know, that's how it works.
[00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:19.017]  But the guy's real nice, but this morning I got an email, literally no sleep, three and a half hours, I'm in here stumbling around before the show, like an hour before.
[00:26:19.717 --> 00:26:24.099]  And we see his email saying, hey guys, you know, you didn't post my latest videos.
[00:26:24.739 --> 00:26:27.000]  I mean, yeah, it's just Kurt Nemo over at Infowars.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.021]  We're overwhelmed.
[00:26:28.361 --> 00:26:34.243]  And that's what I feel bad about, is that our own supporters, people that email me, and I'm not bashing him, he's a great guy.
[00:26:34.403 --> 00:26:35.204]  He works so hard.
[00:26:35.244 --> 00:26:36.944]  He posts like 10, 15 videos a day.
[00:26:37.284 --> 00:26:38.945]  And thank you, Alex Jones Channel guy.
[00:26:39.485 --> 00:26:41.466]  I don't even have time to call him up on the phone and thank him.
[00:26:41.826 --> 00:26:43.547]  I don't have time to hardly see my family anymore.
[00:26:43.987 --> 00:26:46.028]  And I'm going to say this, we're almost done with the studios.
[00:26:46.348 --> 00:26:47.569]  I'm going to have to take some time off.
[00:26:48.089 --> 00:26:49.029]  Just to be with my family.
[00:26:49.069 --> 00:26:52.070]  My children are getting big and I'm seeing them two hours a day.
[00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:55.751]  I'm kind of tired today, so I'm just kind of brainstorming and babbling.
[00:26:55.771 --> 00:26:57.431]  The point is to all of you, we appreciate you.
[00:26:57.451 --> 00:26:59.051]  We just can't respond to the emails and everything.
[00:26:59.191 --> 00:26:59.752]  There's not many of us.
[00:26:59.772 --> 00:27:03.392]  Do you have doubts about the stability of the dollar or your own financial future?
[00:27:03.792 --> 00:27:08.513]  Is a dismal growth rate or rapid inflation affecting the bottom line of your retirement savings account?
[00:27:08.793 --> 00:27:13.835]  Do you worry about uncontrollable economic events which could suddenly wipe out some or all of your hard-earned savings?
[00:27:14.115 --> 00:27:16.035]  You can turn adversity into opportunity.
[00:27:16.215 --> 00:27:24.642]  Individual retirement accounts and most 401Ks, 403Bs, SEPs and other retirement plans can be rolled over into self-directed accounts using gold and silver.
[00:27:24.702 --> 00:27:29.345]  There are definitely some do's and don'ts with this rollover process and that's where Midas Resources comes in.
[00:27:29.685 --> 00:27:35.390]  Call us at 1-866-323-5665 and we can help you with this process.
[00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:40.874]  History has shown that metals will maintain your buying power even if other financial assets are failing.
[00:27:41.354 --> 00:27:45.818]  It's not a question of if you'll need precious metals in your portfolio, it's a question of when.
[00:27:46.298 --> 00:27:51.319]  So whether you're planning for an economic rainy day or a Category 5 hurricane, the solution is the same.
[00:27:51.579 --> 00:27:54.680]  Call us today at 1-866-323-5665.
[00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:56.021]  1-866-323-5665.
[00:27:57.141 --> 00:28:06.003]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:28:06.343 --> 00:28:08.004]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:28:08.996 --> 00:28:10.017]  But who is the enemy?
[00:28:10.517 --> 00:28:11.057]  Bin Laden.
[00:28:11.338 --> 00:28:12.318]  This is his MO.
[00:28:12.338 --> 00:28:13.639]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:28:13.679 --> 00:28:15.340]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:22.445]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:28:22.845 --> 00:28:23.285]  Some U.S.
[00:28:23.325 --> 00:28:29.009]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:28:29.669 --> 00:28:33.150]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:35.971]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:28:59.497 --> 00:29:00.998]  Alex Jones here with a question.

[00:29:52.425 --> 00:29:52.605]  Stingray!
[00:29:52.625 --> 00:29:52.845]  Stingray!
[00:30:16.654 --> 00:30:20.798]  The last bumper music was Jimmy Vaughn.
[00:30:20.818 --> 00:30:23.600]  I got to see him play it live last night on the stage, Alex.
[00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:24.420]  How great was that?
[00:30:24.441 --> 00:30:26.482]  I know we're going to put some of that up there too, Jimmy Vaughn.
[00:30:26.502 --> 00:30:28.184]  Yeah, we did an interview with him in Ventura.
[00:30:28.504 --> 00:30:28.664]  Yeah.
[00:30:28.724 --> 00:30:30.045]  He was a really nice guy.
[00:30:30.786 --> 00:30:31.987]  Yeah, they're great, great people.
[00:30:32.007 --> 00:30:32.907]  And his wife, Robin.
[00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:37.231]  Oh my goodness.
[00:30:38.752 --> 00:30:40.013]  We got Celica Stillo coming up.
[00:30:40.033 --> 00:30:40.994]  That really bums me out.
[00:30:41.014 --> 00:30:41.955]  We'll have him on at the 8 after.
[00:30:43.112 --> 00:30:44.493]  Set up by the Feds.
[00:30:45.534 --> 00:30:46.414]  Three-year conviction.
[00:30:46.754 --> 00:30:48.175]  Is that what they just sent us?
[00:30:48.195 --> 00:30:49.977]  Yeah, I got that fun email this morning.
[00:30:51.778 --> 00:30:53.519]  It's hard enough just to read all these emails.
[00:30:53.559 --> 00:30:55.220]  And Trey's in there reading them as fast as he can.
[00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:58.863]  Aaron's in there trying to read them in between webmastering and posting videos.
[00:30:59.483 --> 00:31:00.304]  And doing everything else.
[00:31:00.324 --> 00:31:01.164]  And am I complaining?
[00:31:01.865 --> 00:31:03.286]  I was trying to explain before the break.
[00:31:03.426 --> 00:31:04.586]  We are limited.
[00:31:05.727 --> 00:31:08.629]  I mean, there's one, two, three...
[00:31:13.325 --> 00:31:16.651]  There's really three people who full-time or even part-time deal with video here.
[00:31:17.332 --> 00:31:20.757]  And then I've got, in this office, two people who can do web stuff.
[00:31:21.879 --> 00:31:23.181]  And then I've got the two Watsons.
[00:31:23.662 --> 00:31:24.323]  And we've got Kurt.
[00:31:25.243 --> 00:31:29.927]  And I mean, in the bigger office we can now get a few extra people to try to go over all this stuff.
[00:31:30.948 --> 00:31:37.153]  I'm just, all the time I get emails going, when I email my Senator I get a response back, I'm not getting a response back from you folks, we don't have it.
[00:31:37.734 --> 00:31:51.466]  Now I'll say this, we have another Bonnie Bomb called, answer all the emails, respond to all the phone calls, Bonnie Bomb, but in a way I don't think that's, I mean, I know I'm missing a lot of calls, I mean when Charlie Sheen tried to get in contact with me, he tried to get in contact with me for a month, until we finally got his email and saw it.
[00:31:55.182 --> 00:31:58.944]  You know, it's the same thing with so many other people that I've missed.
[00:31:58.984 --> 00:32:01.725]  I mean, I've run into celebrities, like, I tried to contact you three years ago.
[00:32:02.386 --> 00:32:09.109]  You know, so we do need to be able to go through everything, but at the same time, I don't even know why I'm getting off into this, it's just I make the point time and time again, I see so many people get mad that we can't respond.
[00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:10.210]  Or we can't tell a story.
[00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:13.491]  Or we can't cover every event, they think it's like a conspiracy.
[00:32:14.252 --> 00:32:16.073]  You know, folks, I am literally
[00:32:16.932 --> 00:32:18.452]  I'm dizzy right now, I'm so tired.
[00:32:18.512 --> 00:32:22.353]  Yeah, I mean I just got an email the other day about this Rothschild situation.
[00:32:22.393 --> 00:32:29.815]  Apparently one of the younger Rothschilds wrote a big letter to the editor in Europe accusing the shadow chancellor over there and Mendelsohn.
[00:32:29.835 --> 00:32:30.596]  Yeah, that's in the press.
[00:32:30.636 --> 00:32:33.636]  Yeah, of taking illegal contributions from this Russian billionaire.
[00:32:33.656 --> 00:32:35.697]  And the guy's like, well why aren't you guys covering it?
[00:32:35.717 --> 00:32:36.557]  It sounds suspicious to me.
[00:32:36.597 --> 00:32:40.858]  I'm like, look man, there's only the BBC America in this network.
[00:32:40.878 --> 00:32:41.918]  No, you just told us!
[00:32:41.958 --> 00:32:42.659]  Yeah, you just told us.
[00:32:42.679 --> 00:32:43.979]  We don't see that in our media.
[00:32:44.199 --> 00:32:51.281]  In fact, we need you to email us stories and links and news, because you're probably a tenth of my emails are, why are you covering this up?
[00:32:51.301 --> 00:32:57.523]  It's something that happened two hours ago, or a day ago, and I'm like... Sometimes it could be a week and we miss it.
[00:32:57.543 --> 00:32:58.463]  I mean, we're not perfect.
[00:32:58.483 --> 00:33:00.663]  We're human beings like everybody else, Alex.
[00:33:00.743 --> 00:33:03.944]  I mean, we're not perfection, you know, and we need more people.
[00:33:04.324 --> 00:33:05.125]  We're far from it.
[00:33:05.185 --> 00:33:05.705]  Are you kidding?
[00:33:06.505 --> 00:33:07.245]  Far from it.
[00:33:07.265 --> 00:33:08.525]  Look at these eyes.
[00:33:09.586 --> 00:33:10.446]  Far from perfection.
[00:33:12.502 --> 00:33:13.382]  Far from perfection.
[00:33:13.442 --> 00:33:17.126]  I was basically going through clouds of smoke yesterday.
[00:33:17.166 --> 00:33:21.449]  I wasn't a second-hand willy-wee.
[00:33:21.669 --> 00:33:22.370]  I'm just joking.
[00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:23.711]  I'm just joking.
[00:33:24.512 --> 00:33:30.437]  I'm just joking.
[00:33:30.477 --> 00:33:32.238]  You know how it is when you're out at the Willy Land.
[00:33:32.278 --> 00:33:34.300]  I mean, how cool is it that he hangs out on this tour bus?
[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:36.001]  I mean, he's literally, you know, you hear that.
[00:33:36.021 --> 00:33:37.783]  No, he walked on the bus and nothing was going on.
[00:33:37.823 --> 00:33:38.744]  It was like layers.
[00:33:42.132 --> 00:33:43.373]  It's just crazy to me, man.
[00:33:43.393 --> 00:33:45.896]  Literally like an old smoke-filled bar, but it wasn't cigarettes.
[00:33:45.956 --> 00:33:48.098]  And it wasn't even really a decked out bus, you know, Willie?
[00:33:48.358 --> 00:33:50.780]  Willie, again, just totally honest.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:52.141]  It looked like my grandmother's kitchen.
[00:33:52.261 --> 00:33:53.563]  Yeah, it's like salt to the earth.
[00:33:53.803 --> 00:33:54.564]  Like, yeah, literally.
[00:33:54.624 --> 00:33:56.385]  Like his house is just one big kitchen.
[00:33:56.545 --> 00:33:57.867]  Everybody really lives in their kitchen.
[00:33:58.447 --> 00:34:00.888]  And if I ever had the money for a really big house, that's what I'd have.
[00:34:01.088 --> 00:34:04.350]  I'd have a house with a huge kitchen built on the living room.
[00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:05.891]  Yeah, and it was a gorgeous house.
[00:34:06.371 --> 00:34:07.132]  Again, very modest.
[00:34:07.292 --> 00:34:08.392]  I'd never seen that construction.
[00:34:08.412 --> 00:34:13.775]  People will see little clips of it, but they actually had cut wood trees in the cement.
[00:34:13.795 --> 00:34:14.816]  That's the German style.
[00:34:15.536 --> 00:34:15.956]  Very cool.
[00:34:16.536 --> 00:34:17.177]  Those are really great.
[00:34:18.157 --> 00:34:19.458]  Alright, we have really babbled here.
[00:34:19.678 --> 00:34:24.621]  You know, you want to go, because I'm going to have Costello on for about 30 minutes, you want to go pull, later during the break, I want you with us.
[00:34:25.121 --> 00:34:30.805]  You want to go pull that particular Rothschild story, because I saw that, I think yesterday, in the morning, I never got to it.
[00:34:31.265 --> 00:34:32.526]  This is the first time I've been back on air.
[00:34:33.026 --> 00:34:35.488]  So we'll cover that too, coming up.
[00:34:35.508 --> 00:34:36.829]  I've got a bunch of other news, stay with us.
[00:34:48.516 --> 00:34:53.020]  Stay with us.

[00:36:23.335 --> 00:36:25.355]  This will be a big news blitz I haven't covered yet.
[00:36:25.796 --> 00:36:29.437]  At the end of the show I covered some of the, about two-thirds of the stack is still here.
[00:36:29.977 --> 00:36:31.498]  Vital info on a host of issues.
[00:36:32.218 --> 00:36:34.079]  One of these articles alone I could spend all day.
[00:36:34.339 --> 00:36:37.541]  The mainstream news now admitting everything we warned them about for the last 13 years.
[00:36:38.581 --> 00:36:42.982]  It's all Pentagon design, face scanning, retina scanning, thumb printing everywhere to buy and sell.
[00:36:43.002 --> 00:36:44.082]  It's going to go in everywhere.
[00:36:44.662 --> 00:36:46.983]  The license plate scanners are following you.
[00:36:47.003 --> 00:36:48.223]  They want you to know now.
[00:36:48.523 --> 00:36:53.444]  Your walk, AI computer systems watching everything you do from the time you leave your home, everything you purchase.
[00:36:53.884 --> 00:36:57.465]  I mean, just no Fourth Amendment, total microscope, total tyranny.
[00:36:57.625 --> 00:37:02.006]  While the government makes everything they do, like the criminal banker takeover, bailout, secret.
[00:37:02.506 --> 00:37:06.387]  And the White House Press Secretary says, well, we just need to trust our Treasury Secretary.
[00:37:06.847 --> 00:37:09.969]  I mean, folks, it is just... they are going for broke, Burmese.
[00:37:10.149 --> 00:37:13.130]  Yeah, and they're integrating new systems all the time.
[00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:18.333]  You know, I have my little price chopper card to get my discount because I can't get anything on sale anymore.
[00:37:18.373 --> 00:37:19.253]  They make you carry the card.
[00:37:19.273 --> 00:37:23.835]  They actually use that to war game to figure out what people can't... it's a complex algorithm to screw you.
[00:37:24.036 --> 00:37:27.157]  And even better now, Alex, they have now teamed up with Sunoco.
[00:37:27.477 --> 00:37:31.779]  So now when I use my card, I get 10, 20, 30 cents off gas.
[00:37:31.799 --> 00:37:32.700]  So now they get me twice.
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:35.501]  All right, now if I go shopping... They're linking databases.
[00:37:35.761 --> 00:37:37.262]  Absolutely linking databases.
[00:37:37.282 --> 00:37:38.382]  And how can you not do it?
[00:37:38.402 --> 00:37:40.083]  I mean, you know you're going to shop there anyway.
[00:37:40.323 --> 00:37:41.444]  You know gas is over $3 a gallon.
[00:37:41.464 --> 00:37:42.604]  How can you not do it, Marmus?
[00:37:42.624 --> 00:37:43.645]  You're so worldly.
[00:37:44.165 --> 00:37:46.446]  I know it's tough, but... You just buy into everything they do.
[00:37:46.746 --> 00:37:50.148]  I'm saying, for the average person, groceries have gone up.
[00:37:50.388 --> 00:37:51.108]  Gas has gone up.
[00:37:51.128 --> 00:37:52.689]  Because they know how to grid us now.
[00:37:52.809 --> 00:37:56.351]  It's all psychological system, warfare system, to destroy us.
[00:37:56.631 --> 00:37:58.952]  And I know, and I get caught up in these systems.
[00:37:58.972 --> 00:38:02.594]  I mean, Alex, my two choices in my town is I can go to the Walmart,
[00:38:03.154 --> 00:38:05.295]  Which is total Chinese slave labor.
[00:38:05.335 --> 00:38:06.736]  Everybody should go out and see Wal-Mart.
[00:38:06.756 --> 00:38:08.736]  The high cost, the low price is a real eye-opener.
[00:38:09.237 --> 00:38:10.797]  Yeah, you live in rural upstate New York.
[00:38:10.817 --> 00:38:12.358]  Yeah, or I can go to Price Chopper.
[00:38:12.738 --> 00:38:26.764]  Now, I can either give my money to these slave masters at Wal-Mart, or I can give my money to these new control masters at Price Chopper, who are now not only tracking what I eat and buy... Well, if you're going to do it, you should at least give them this info name.
[00:38:27.224 --> 00:38:27.644]  Yeah, I don't know.
[00:38:27.664 --> 00:38:28.845]  I don't use my own card, actually.
[00:38:28.905 --> 00:38:30.846]  I use one of my college friends' little card.
[00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:32.271]  That is true.
[00:38:32.291 --> 00:38:39.178]  Let me tell you what they, when I found this out 11 years ago in federal documents, we covered them on air at the time, I don't even remember what they were now.
[00:38:39.759 --> 00:38:42.301]  But you can go pull it up, you'll find it, everything I tell you is documented.
[00:38:42.822 --> 00:38:44.584]  But today my memory's not working too well.
[00:38:44.604 --> 00:38:48.588]  The point is, it said they're going to have a national sales tax, but they're going to keep the income tax, they're just going to rename it.
[00:38:49.008 --> 00:38:50.370]  So all these fair tax, fair tax.
[00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:51.571]  Yeah folks, just wait.
[00:38:51.831 --> 00:38:52.031]  Fine.
[00:38:52.332 --> 00:38:53.913]  Believe that I'm lying and just find out.
[00:38:54.724 --> 00:38:55.164]  You want it?
[00:38:55.204 --> 00:38:55.484]  Fine.
[00:38:55.504 --> 00:38:56.205]  Just, you know what?
[00:38:56.425 --> 00:38:56.725]  Have it.
[00:38:57.005 --> 00:38:58.565]  I told you the banks were hoarding all the money.
[00:38:58.785 --> 00:38:59.646]  Now it's mainstream news.
[00:38:59.806 --> 00:39:00.746]  You're not going to get any of it.
[00:39:00.766 --> 00:39:02.607]  All you're going to get is a barrel in the mouth from some idiot.
[00:39:02.627 --> 00:39:04.127]  And that's New York Times today, by the way.
[00:39:04.327 --> 00:39:04.907]  Yeah, I know.
[00:39:04.947 --> 00:39:08.149]  But the point here is, is that, I don't even care anymore.
[00:39:08.209 --> 00:39:08.929]  Why should I tell them?
[00:39:09.169 --> 00:39:15.991]  The point is, they're getting you ready to show your ID and thumbprint to buy and sell for a national sales tax, which is going to be graduated.
[00:39:16.151 --> 00:39:18.032]  They're going, oh, it's fair if you're poor, you won't pay.
[00:39:18.712 --> 00:39:30.083]  That's only at first, and they're going to crack everything you do, then they're going to have social workers come after you saying you're eating unhealthy food, environmental police, it's going to be carbon credits, it's all official, it's all, it's hell, okay?
[00:39:30.143 --> 00:39:30.584]  It's hell.
[00:39:30.744 --> 00:39:37.791]  And that'll even tie into Codex Alimentarius, which you discussed really briefly earlier, where they're literally trying to now regulate what we eat.
[00:39:38.331 --> 00:39:40.372]  You know, there's no end to it, Burma!
[00:39:40.412 --> 00:39:41.072]  There isn't an end.
[00:39:41.252 --> 00:39:52.015]  And Codex Alimentarius, I encourage people out there to go look into it, because there really has not been a mainstream work, or even a non-mainstream work, an alternative work, that's gone big.
[00:39:52.335 --> 00:39:53.976]  And this is something people need to know about.
[00:39:54.456 --> 00:39:56.656]  They're trying to put this legislation through in 2011 or 2012 at the latest.
[00:39:58.897 --> 00:40:01.620]  And I think it's scary that the government's... Well, a lot of that's red herring.
[00:40:02.121 --> 00:40:04.884]  They're already putting in Codex Alimentarius under other names.
[00:40:05.184 --> 00:40:07.106]  They're already cracking down on vitamin makers and others.
[00:40:07.126 --> 00:40:11.271]  Of course, there's a few bad apples and a few bad examples, but they won't even regulate vitamin C and stuff.
[00:40:11.291 --> 00:40:12.692]  They're already doing it at the state level.
[00:40:13.193 --> 00:40:16.997]  They're threatening vitamin companies to incriminate themselves.
[00:40:17.017 --> 00:40:19.499]  I got a bunch of news I never got to about that last week.
[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:23.441]  Folks, we're getting hit from too many sides here.
[00:40:23.701 --> 00:40:25.481]  I can't even keep track of it anymore.
[00:40:25.521 --> 00:40:26.882]  It's everything we told you and worse.
[00:40:27.182 --> 00:40:28.962]  It's happening faster than I thought.
[00:40:31.683 --> 00:40:36.204]  Well, we're at the tip of the spear, Alex, and we've just got to keep pressing forward, man, and trying to take this Goliath down.
[00:40:38.784 --> 00:40:39.545]  We don't have a choice.
[00:40:39.605 --> 00:40:43.666]  They're building a psychological, technological enslavement grid.
[00:40:43.706 --> 00:40:44.866]  They say that's what it is.
[00:40:47.162 --> 00:40:50.403]  Katie, bar the door, because, I mean, these people are a bunch of eugenicists.
[00:40:50.423 --> 00:40:51.064]  Look at Paulson.
[00:40:51.484 --> 00:40:53.184]  He's the Nature Conservancy former head.
[00:40:53.205 --> 00:40:54.425]  He admits he's anti-human.
[00:40:54.445 --> 00:40:56.066]  I mean, they hate us, man.
[00:40:56.106 --> 00:40:56.886]  They hate us!
[00:40:57.826 --> 00:40:58.527]  We'll be right back.
[00:40:59.507 --> 00:41:03.989]  Ask yourself, is there a natural way to... Oh, God.
[00:41:04.249 --> 00:41:08.691]  Well, we're at the tip of the spear, Alex, and we just gotta keep pressing forward, man, and trying to take this goliath down.
[00:41:11.343 --> 00:41:12.104]  We don't have a choice.
[00:41:12.124 --> 00:41:16.227]  They're building a psychological, technological enslavement grid.
[00:41:16.267 --> 00:41:17.488]  They say that's what it is.
[00:41:18.729 --> 00:41:20.631]  And Katie, bar the door.
[00:41:20.771 --> 00:41:22.973]  Because, I mean, these people are a bunch of eugenicists.
[00:41:22.993 --> 00:41:23.694]  Look at Paulson.
[00:41:24.054 --> 00:41:25.735]  He's the Nature Conservancy former head.
[00:41:25.775 --> 00:41:26.996]  He admits he's anti-human.
[00:41:27.237 --> 00:41:28.638]  I mean, they hate us, man.
[00:41:28.678 --> 00:41:29.358]  They hate us.
[00:41:32.009 --> 00:41:43.459]  Ask yourself, is there a natural way to detoxify your body, lower blood pressure, remove heavy metals and sediment buildup in your body, alkalize and balance your pH level, and lower those cravings for junk food all at once?

[00:42:31.969 --> 00:42:38.354]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:42:38.714 --> 00:42:40.695]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:42:41.356 --> 00:42:42.416]  But who is the enemy?
[00:42:42.897 --> 00:42:43.437]  Bin Laden.
[00:42:43.697 --> 00:42:44.678]  This is his MO.
[00:42:44.698 --> 00:42:46.039]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:42:46.079 --> 00:42:47.500]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:54.786]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:42:55.206 --> 00:42:55.646]  Some U.S.
[00:42:55.686 --> 00:43:01.471]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:43:02.031 --> 00:43:05.494]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:43:05.734 --> 00:43:15.781]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:43:16.001 --> 00:43:16.762]  Fabled enemies.

[00:43:34.521 --> 00:43:35.643]  Here's a startling fact.
[00:43:36.304 --> 00:43:38.106]  The New World Order wants you dead.
[00:43:38.366 --> 00:43:40.169]  Chemicals and toxins are in the air.
[00:43:40.369 --> 00:43:41.270]  Bio-warfare.
[00:43:41.511 --> 00:43:43.333]  Drugs and unknown substances.
[00:43:43.613 --> 00:43:44.935]  Foods with no vitamins.
[00:43:45.356 --> 00:43:46.978]  Fast food for obesity.
[00:43:47.358 --> 00:43:48.680]  Fluoride in our water!
[00:43:49.041 --> 00:43:50.002]  How do we fight back?
[00:43:50.422 --> 00:43:51.203]  What do we do?
[00:43:51.603 --> 00:43:52.964]  Make a life change decision.
[00:43:52.984 --> 00:43:54.184]  Get ahead of the curve.
[00:43:54.445 --> 00:43:55.965]  Get the T dot com.
[00:43:56.126 --> 00:43:59.027]  That's get the T dot com.
[00:43:59.207 --> 00:44:01.969]  Cleanse your body and internal organs.
[00:44:02.269 --> 00:44:04.090]  Lose weight and receive more energy.
[00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:07.532]  Get aboard the life change boat and say no to losing their job.
[00:44:08.873 --> 00:44:10.394]  The dollar buys a nickel's worth.
[00:44:10.874 --> 00:44:11.895]  Banks are going bust.
[00:44:11.975 --> 00:44:13.876]  Shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter.
[00:44:14.536 --> 00:44:16.077]  Punks are running wild in the street.
[00:44:16.157 --> 00:44:18.699]  There's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do and there's no end to it.
[00:44:20.347 --> 00:44:20.727]  We know.
[00:44:21.188 --> 00:44:22.809]  The air is unfit to breathe.
[00:44:22.869 --> 00:44:24.310]  Our food is unfit to eat.
[00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:33.576]  We sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had 15 homicides and 63 violent crimes, as if that's the way it's supposed to be!
[00:44:33.856 --> 00:44:35.898]  We know things are bad, worse than bad!
[00:44:36.528 --> 00:44:37.249]  They're crazy.
[00:44:37.449 --> 00:44:40.493]  It's like everything everywhere is going crazy so we don't go out anymore.
[00:44:40.873 --> 00:44:47.781]  We sit in the house and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller and all we say is, please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms.
[00:44:47.821 --> 00:44:52.186]  Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radios and I won't say anything.
[00:44:52.386 --> 00:44:53.267]  Just leave us alone.
[00:44:53.447 --> 00:44:54.849]  Well, I'm not gonna leave you alone.
[00:44:55.690 --> 00:44:56.791]  I want you to get mad!
[00:44:57.984 --> 00:44:58.945]  I don't want you to protest.
[00:44:59.065 --> 00:45:00.066]  I don't want you to riot.
[00:45:00.086 --> 00:45:03.049]  I don't want you to write to your congressmen because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write.
[00:45:03.409 --> 00:45:07.713]  I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street.
[00:45:08.053 --> 00:45:10.596]  All I know is that first, you've got to get mad!
[00:45:11.036 --> 00:45:12.918]  You've got to say, I'm a human being!
[00:45:13.158 --> 00:45:14.379]  My life has value!
[00:45:15.981 --> 00:45:18.583]  I want you to get up now.
[00:45:19.444 --> 00:45:21.426]  I want all of you to get up out of your chairs.
[00:45:22.797 --> 00:45:33.183]  I want you to get up right now, go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell, I'm as tired as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!
[00:45:33.203 --> 00:45:46.912]  I want you to get up right now, get up, go to your windows, open them and stick your head out and yell, I'm as tired as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!
[00:46:03.558 --> 00:46:06.800]  Well, I wish we could have him on under better circumstances.
[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:08.821]  You know, again, our listeners.
[00:46:10.049 --> 00:46:10.829]  We didn't used to do it a lot.
[00:46:10.849 --> 00:46:12.630]  We do it more and more trying to help people in distress.
[00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:18.153]  He raced quite a bit for his defense but not enough and obviously it was a rigged game.
[00:46:18.654 --> 00:46:21.815]  So now I guess he's going to try to appeal or going away for three years.
[00:46:22.396 --> 00:46:23.156]  So look at Stello.
[00:46:23.256 --> 00:46:26.018]  He was an army sniper in Vietnam.
[00:46:26.658 --> 00:46:27.819]  He was then a sheriff's deputy.
[00:46:28.972 --> 00:46:35.294]  Down on the border, he then was a DEA agent, the head guy down there over quite a few in Central and South America and Mexico.
[00:46:36.135 --> 00:46:40.376]  Witnessed government drug dealing and shipping narcotics into the United States out of Jalapeno and others.
[00:46:42.337 --> 00:46:46.418]  And Sally likes to go to gun shows and sell his book, Powder Burns.
[00:46:47.378 --> 00:46:49.379]  And I remember going back, must have been like
[00:46:51.007 --> 00:46:58.057]  Now, when I first interviewed Sully and talked to him probably about eight years ago, and then Kevin Booth made the drug war film that's been on national television and they really got mad.
[00:46:58.097 --> 00:47:00.160]  They even mentioned that when they set him up and arrested him.
[00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:00.720]  Oh, the guy on TV.
[00:47:02.541 --> 00:47:09.223]  That's been won a bunch of awards, been on Showtime, and incidentally we have that video available on DVD at InfoWars.com, American Drug War.
[00:47:09.243 --> 00:47:10.883]  It's two hours long with three hours of extra.
[00:47:10.903 --> 00:47:12.864]  It's really like five hours, five hour film.
[00:47:14.204 --> 00:47:16.705]  But Shelly got set up.
[00:47:16.725 --> 00:47:18.765]  So Shelly, why don't you recap.
[00:47:18.785 --> 00:47:19.966]  First off, we're praying for you.
[00:47:20.186 --> 00:47:21.506]  We tried our best to help you here.
[00:47:22.486 --> 00:47:28.268]  First off, about how you got set up, what happened, what happened in the trial, because you haven't been speaking a lot during the trial.
[00:47:30.689 --> 00:47:48.199]  Well, you know, from the get-go, Alex, I knew that I hadn't done anything illegal, and I complained to the agents about it, and so forth.
[00:47:48.559 --> 00:47:52.301]  And my attorney brought this to the attention of the U.S.
[00:47:52.322 --> 00:47:53.822]  Attorney's Office, and they said,
[00:47:55.410 --> 00:47:55.950]  He's guilty.
[00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:57.511]  You know, he's going to do this and that and this and that.
[00:47:57.551 --> 00:48:08.836]  Well, bottom line, Alex, seven months later, on October 1st, the government dismissed my case completely under Pope versus U.S.
[00:48:09.256 --> 00:48:11.017]  And I wasn't a prohibited person.
[00:48:11.697 --> 00:48:13.578]  And what I was doing was not against the law.
[00:48:14.458 --> 00:48:22.742]  So when I went up there before to get my charges dropped, well, Lord and behold, a U.S.
[00:48:22.782 --> 00:48:23.362]  prosecutor
[00:48:27.716 --> 00:48:41.379]  So it really is double jeopardy because, I mean it's not the classic double jeopardy but it is, you're found not, it's thrown out and so they just slap more on you.
[00:48:48.217 --> 00:48:50.699]  Well, let's go back to the original case, how they set you up.
[00:48:50.739 --> 00:48:52.801]  I mean, you're not some big gun dealer.
[00:48:52.821 --> 00:48:54.142]  You're allowed to have private sales.
[00:48:54.642 --> 00:48:55.543]  Well, exactly.
[00:48:55.583 --> 00:49:01.208]  You know, I was at the gun shows and I was, you know, doing like what half of the vendors do at the gun shows, you know.
[00:49:01.228 --> 00:49:03.790]  It's like you told me about four years ago when I saw you at the gun show.
[00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:07.111]  I said, oh, last time I didn't see you selling guns and you had two or three on the table.
[00:49:07.531 --> 00:49:14.914]  You said, yeah, I can't even afford to drive around Texas a few times a month as a school teacher, the gas, to sell five or six books.
[00:49:15.234 --> 00:49:20.016]  So just to be here and educate the public, you know, I might sell and trade as a collector.
[00:49:20.336 --> 00:49:21.877]  I mean, you're a gun guy.
[00:49:21.897 --> 00:49:23.437]  Your dad was a World War II hero.
[00:49:23.457 --> 00:49:26.719]  You're a cop, a sniper, a DEA guy.
[00:49:26.799 --> 00:49:29.160]  I mean, you know, we're allowed to go and sell guns here.
[00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:29.740]  I mean, come on.
[00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:30.760]  Exactly.
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:44.367]  So anyway, Alex, to make a long story short, I left the courtroom on the first, and I called my mom, just 84 years old, Alex, and she said, you know, son, you probably could beat this case if you wanted to, but you know what?
[00:49:44.427 --> 00:49:52.291]  It's going to take forever, and I don't have that long, and if you do lose, you'll be going away for about seven years, so I won't be around, and I want you to be out.
[00:49:52.711 --> 00:49:55.732]  So I went back in there, and I pled guilty to the two counts.
[00:49:55.873 --> 00:49:57.113]  It was a five-year count each.
[00:49:59.213 --> 00:50:00.014]  That was it, you know.
[00:50:01.034 --> 00:50:15.384]  And then I come up to sentences on the 22nd of this month, and I put my letters in like everybody else has, and you know, the professors, law enforcement guys, professors, you name it.
[00:50:15.704 --> 00:50:19.446]  I put about eight letters in there, a character reference, which were great.
[00:50:20.207 --> 00:50:23.829]  And I went up there and the judge, you know, said that
[00:50:25.461 --> 00:50:29.342]  He was going to sentence me to the minimum of the guidelines for 37 months.
[00:50:29.402 --> 00:50:34.384]  And I said, you know, he didn't take it for granted my post-traumatic stress disorder or anything else like that.
[00:50:34.444 --> 00:50:39.026]  I mean, you know, and I wrote him a letter also and I said, you know, whatever it is, it is.
[00:50:39.146 --> 00:50:43.667]  And, you know, I need to, uh, uh, if you're going to sentence me, then fine.
[00:50:43.747 --> 00:50:45.848]  And I argued my points.
[00:50:46.508 --> 00:50:49.269]  I had five issues I needed to argue on him and I did.
[00:50:49.289 --> 00:50:51.830]  And, um, basically he, um,
[00:50:52.921 --> 00:51:02.286]  He objected to all of them and sentenced me to 37 months in a medical facility, Alex.
[00:51:03.306 --> 00:51:13.791]  So I'll be in a medical facility somewhere for 3 years and I'm trying to get my attorney... Well thank God you're not going to be in general population!
[00:51:13.871 --> 00:51:16.353]  Well that's the big plus on it, Alex.
[00:51:16.513 --> 00:51:20.975]  And you know the thing about it is I got to appeal my sentence and I got 10 days to do that.
[00:51:21.707 --> 00:51:31.551]  And if anybody can help me, just go to my email address, which is powderburnsatprodigy.net, and I'll email you right back, you know, for some assistance.
[00:51:31.771 --> 00:51:42.195]  But, you know, Alex, I believed in your digital system, and for some reason, I mean, it was just, I got, you know, nothing.
[00:51:42.235 --> 00:51:43.635]  I'm 59 years old, Alex.
[00:51:45.136 --> 00:51:46.696]  Never been in trouble before in my life.
[00:51:46.716 --> 00:51:48.557]  20 years of federal law enforcement.
[00:51:49.059 --> 00:51:53.387]  Being a teacher, being an activist, being everything that I could have done for my country.
[00:51:55.583 --> 00:51:56.103]  I got 37 months.
[00:51:56.203 --> 00:51:56.603]  I know, Alex.
[00:52:21.332 --> 00:52:25.595]  No, Sully, we appreciate you, but I want to try to explain something to people here.
[00:52:26.415 --> 00:52:35.361]  Sully sounds very resigned now to this, and you know, he's a real man and a real hero and a patriot, but he's not even telling you today what he told you six months ago or five months ago here on the show.
[00:52:35.762 --> 00:52:38.664]  He was clearly set up, just like Randy Weaver,
[00:52:39.524 --> 00:53:07.170]  uh... this person kept coming to him saying please buy these thirteen guns or whatever the number was please please please i'll give you a deal almost for nothing and selling these money and so he's living in a trailer taking care of his kids a school teacher in south texas makes almost nothing he's medically disabled uh... you know he's been all this combat over and over again and and i mean i have to know if she you know it's a little a lot of money and and and and so you know i will y'all all take these guns and sell them you know that's totally legal but it's how they
[00:53:07.850 --> 00:53:08.971]  Yeah, well basically, that's what it was.
[00:53:09.011 --> 00:53:09.951]  You know, the guy who sold me the guns,
[00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:35.862]  It was an individual who did the straw purchases.
[00:53:35.882 --> 00:53:43.628]  You know, Alex, he was never arrested until a few months ago, because I threatened to address the issue with the judge, and they went out and arrested him.
[00:53:44.269 --> 00:53:49.133]  But I don't know if they'll dismiss the case on him now or not.
[00:53:50.073 --> 00:53:57.019]  I would feel that they probably would do that, because he set me up and got me.
[00:53:57.139 --> 00:54:00.762]  But he's the individual who actually did the straw purchases.
[00:54:01.428 --> 00:54:01.988]  And not me.
[00:54:02.228 --> 00:54:04.629]  And he sold them to me, and I just sold the guns.
[00:54:04.789 --> 00:54:22.732]  And bottom line is, I beat him on the first thing, and now I need to go back and file the appeal on my sentencing, which is... You know, I had two hours' argument with the judge, and he gave me, I think, some pretty good leeway on evidence for appeal.
[00:54:23.292 --> 00:54:30.674]  And if I do appeal that, I'll probably go down maybe ten levels on the federal guidelines, which means I would qualify for probation.
[00:54:31.041 --> 00:54:32.161]  Well, let's be clear here.
[00:54:59.175 --> 00:55:00.276]  And I've looked at these cases.
[00:55:00.356 --> 00:55:05.199]  Normally somebody is selling a couple of, quote, guns that were straw purchased at gun shows.
[00:55:05.219 --> 00:55:05.920]  You hadn't even done that.
[00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:06.800]  You had them at your house.
[00:55:07.361 --> 00:55:07.521]  Right.
[00:55:07.661 --> 00:55:11.904]  I mean, you're talking about maybe probation, maybe plea bargain down to nothing.
[00:55:12.284 --> 00:55:16.187]  I mean, hardcore murderers are spending, you know, a couple years in prison.
[00:55:16.247 --> 00:55:18.509]  Home invasion people are spending six months a lot of times.
[00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:23.732]  But here you are with a sparkling record, commendations from President George H.W.
[00:55:23.772 --> 00:55:24.093]  Bush.
[00:55:24.473 --> 00:55:26.474]  It's like they threw the book at Compiosis and
[00:55:27.855 --> 00:55:38.219]  The problem with that, Alex, to me this is a death sentence because of my health issues.
[00:55:38.939 --> 00:55:41.160]  Whether it's one year or two years or three years.
[00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:45.341]  I went up there and I looked for a headstone already.
[00:55:45.821 --> 00:55:47.482]  And I went up there and I did my obituary.
[00:55:48.089 --> 00:55:50.233]  Because I don't think I'm going to survive those three years.
[00:55:59.864 --> 00:56:00.824]  On September 11, 2000.
[00:56:01.064 --> 00:56:02.525]  They almost kill them in prison.
[00:56:02.865 --> 00:56:04.485]  They love burning cops, man.
[00:56:04.565 --> 00:56:10.627]  The problem with that, Alex, that I will... To me, this is a death sentence because of my health issues.
[00:56:10.707 --> 00:56:14.108]  Whether it's one year or two years or three years, you know.
[00:56:14.128 --> 00:56:17.169]  I went up there and I looked for a headstone already.
[00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:19.950]  And I went up there and I did my obituary.
[00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:23.031]  Because I don't think I'm going to survive those three years in prison.
[00:56:23.251 --> 00:56:24.692]  You have a lot of medical problems.
[00:56:24.732 --> 00:56:26.193]  If you want to talk about those, people know.
[00:56:26.233 --> 00:56:27.513]  We can talk about them on the other side.
[00:56:27.874 --> 00:56:29.795]  Be right back with Sonny Costello and Jason Berman.
[00:56:32.236 --> 00:56:37.659]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:56:37.959 --> 00:56:39.260]  And we knew what to do.
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:41.061]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:56:41.281 --> 00:56:47.645]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:56:48.314 --> 00:56:56.857]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:56:57.197 --> 00:57:03.999]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:57:04.299 --> 00:57:07.320]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:12.522]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:57:13.223 --> 00:57:15.886]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:57:16.327 --> 00:57:22.195]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.

[00:57:25.299 --> 00:57:30.206]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:57:31.601 --> 00:57:33.483]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:57:33.703 --> 00:57:33.984]  October 27, 2008.

[00:57:49.782 --> 00:57:55.289]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[00:57:55.329 --> 00:57:59.313]  treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing the Yan revolution.
[00:57:59.614 --> 00:58:07.423]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[00:58:07.463 --> 00:58:09.826]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[00:58:10.086 --> 00:58:13.687]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[00:58:13.847 --> 00:58:19.770]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.

[00:59:32.526 --> 00:59:35.890]  Are you sick and tired of spending your hard-earned money to fill your gas tank?
[00:59:36.210 --> 00:59:37.572]  Then do something about it.
[00:59:37.892 --> 00:59:41.397]  Fuel Saver's Fuel Conditioner lets you drive further on each gallon of fuel.
[00:59:41.677 --> 00:59:43.379]  Completely safe for all engines.

[01:00:06.276 --> 01:00:07.337]  Well, Shelly's a great guy.
[01:00:07.357 --> 01:00:11.559]  He was just thanking the listeners to me during the break without the $5,000 or whatever it was.
[01:00:11.579 --> 01:00:12.879]  I'm surprised it wasn't more.
[01:00:15.017 --> 01:00:15.317]  That's right.
[01:00:30.270 --> 01:00:46.222]  When the stupid state policeman here in Texas doesn't know that Danny Romero that does his website for him and Celica Stillo and all the people that are exposing the phony drug war are just out there taking a risk to do that.
[01:00:47.263 --> 01:00:49.565]  The website of course is PowderBurns.com
[01:00:51.622 --> 01:00:53.865]  Yeah, PowderBurns.org.
[01:00:54.165 --> 01:01:00.213]  And I take a risk saying this, I take a risk doing this here on air.
[01:01:01.955 --> 01:01:06.621]  The other people, like Danny and others that have supported, Sully, take a risk, Sully.
[01:01:07.322 --> 01:01:09.302]  You know, took a huge risk and got all sorts of threats.
[01:01:09.362 --> 01:01:13.723]  I remember you, two years ago on the show, saying, I've had threats, they're telling me they're going to set me up.
[01:01:14.543 --> 01:01:19.724]  And we're going to keep you over and talk about your appeal and how folks can help you and the medical issues.
[01:01:19.744 --> 01:01:24.445]  But, I mean, I want people to understand what you've gone through in this saga, exposing government drug dealing.
[01:01:24.905 --> 01:01:25.486]  Celica Stillo.
[01:01:25.946 --> 01:01:32.747]  Yeah, well, you know, I've exposed it from the get-go, from the human rights violations by the CIA down in Central America.
[01:01:33.453 --> 01:01:36.314]  And a lot of people will say, well, that happened back in the 80s.
[01:01:36.394 --> 01:01:38.114]  Why the issue is still going on?
[01:01:38.594 --> 01:01:51.377]  Well, what a lot of people don't realize, Alex, the same people that were at the White House at that time period are still working at the White House, like Negra Ponte and Abrams and other people there.
[01:01:51.777 --> 01:01:53.858]  They're still running this administration.
[01:01:54.138 --> 01:01:58.559]  And it's very important because they're using the same blueprints that they used back in the 80s.
[01:02:00.052 --> 01:02:00.312]  I don't
[01:02:24.669 --> 01:02:31.413]  You know, when that night I got arrested, I got thrown with a hundred of the worst criminals in Texas.
[01:02:32.714 --> 01:02:33.694]  Can you imagine?
[01:02:33.835 --> 01:02:36.696]  One of them would have found out what I had done for a living, you know?
[01:02:37.176 --> 01:02:39.618]  And they didn't even take my six-inch blade from me.
[01:02:40.238 --> 01:02:42.580]  And I had it with me all day.
[01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:46.342]  And thank God I didn't get hurt.
[01:02:46.402 --> 01:02:50.064]  You're saying the police, when they threw you back in there, let you keep your knife?
[01:02:50.529 --> 01:02:57.735]  Yes, not only that, they let me keep my $200 I had in my pocket and I was not given my medication.
[01:02:59.456 --> 01:03:02.139]  Although they did have my medication, but they didn't give it to me.
[01:03:02.659 --> 01:03:12.087]  So I felt that I was being set up to get whacked or killed or whatever because this is a federal facility.
[01:03:12.787 --> 01:03:15.109]  How is it possible that they didn't search me?
[01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:19.753]  I kept waiting for them to search me and do everything they had to do, but I just
[01:03:20.194 --> 01:03:23.955]  And I called him several times and he just kept saying, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:03:24.515 --> 01:03:25.956]  Oh, you told him, take my knife!
[01:03:27.136 --> 01:03:33.477]  Well, I didn't want to say that because then the other guys would have probably tried to rush me and try to get the knife from me, you know?
[01:03:33.918 --> 01:03:34.598]  Oh, I understand.
[01:03:34.758 --> 01:03:38.939]  Yeah, tell us about the second arrest, because the judge throws out the first one.
[01:03:39.239 --> 01:03:41.419]  Explain why that setup was thrown out.
[01:03:41.519 --> 01:03:45.501]  Well, it was set up because there's a case law called Polk v. U.S.
[01:03:45.521 --> 01:03:45.621]  that
[01:03:47.785 --> 01:04:01.853]  And they basically charged me with the wrong count, and my attorney beat that, and finally they told them that they were going to have to dismiss the case, but they would not dismiss my case until I pled out to the two new counts.
[01:04:03.193 --> 01:04:16.461]  So it was, I didn't even have time to read the whole agreement that I was pleading out to, and the reason that I, one of the other reasons that I pled out was because the U.S.
[01:04:16.541 --> 01:04:17.241]  Attorney told me
[01:04:17.754 --> 01:04:20.156]  If you plead after this, you will not lose your benefits.
[01:04:36.946 --> 01:04:50.517]  Well, I just want to thank everybody that has helped you, all the listeners, Ted Anderson having you on, Kevin Booth exposing all the information that you brought forward, Danny Romero doing your website, everybody, but especially the listeners.

[01:05:27.313 --> 01:05:44.948]  All right, we're going to come back and get more into the case and where this is going, and then talk about government narcotics trafficking with that CIA aircraft a few months ago crashing with 3.3 tons of pure cocaine on a CIA aircraft.
[01:05:45.308 --> 01:05:46.069]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:46.349 --> 01:05:46.810]  Stay with us.
[01:05:46.850 --> 01:05:47.951]  Shelley Costello is our guest.

[01:05:56.374 --> 01:05:56.814]  Once again, 956-345-5770.
[01:06:05.345 --> 01:06:17.334]  All right, we're going to come back and get more into the case and where this is going and then talk about government narcotics trafficking with that CIA aircraft a few months ago crashing with 3.3 tons of pure cocaine on a CIA aircraft.

[01:06:18.755 --> 01:06:19.216]  Stay with us.
[01:06:19.256 --> 01:06:20.397]  Celica Stillo is our guest.
[01:06:21.838 --> 01:06:22.758]  We're on the march.
[01:06:23.259 --> 01:06:24.840]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:06:25.761 --> 01:06:28.443]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:33.644 --> 01:06:38.946]  Are you tired of hearing that a cure for cancer is coming, but it will be available sometime in the future?
[01:06:39.286 --> 01:06:41.567]  At LaysMedInc, the future is here.

[01:07:17.188 --> 01:07:19.150]  That's L-A-S-E M-E-D-I-N-C dot com today.
[01:07:31.784 --> 01:07:38.193]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:07:38.553 --> 01:07:40.536]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:07:41.197 --> 01:07:42.258]  But who is the enemy?
[01:07:42.739 --> 01:07:43.279]  Bin Laden.
[01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:44.361]  This is his ammo.
[01:07:44.401 --> 01:07:45.883]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:07:45.923 --> 01:07:46.664]  We have to look to Uzbekistan.
[01:07:46.744 --> 01:07:49.947]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[01:07:49.967 --> 01:07:51.888]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:15.605]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:08:15.845 --> 01:08:16.586]  Fabled enemies.

[01:08:24.830 --> 01:08:28.212]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[01:08:31.764 --> 01:08:34.705]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:08:34.725 --> 01:08:40.047]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:08:40.367 --> 01:08:45.689]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:08:46.069 --> 01:08:47.230]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:08:47.570 --> 01:08:53.592]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headache,
[01:08:53.632 --> 01:08:58.495]  I know we've got phone calls holding and somebody's going to leave us here in about 10 minutes.
[01:08:58.656 --> 01:09:00.357]  We'll go to your calls.
[01:09:00.437 --> 01:09:05.941]  Burmish, you want to run out and find that Rothschild clip you keep talking about so John can play it?
[01:09:05.961 --> 01:09:06.901]  You reminded me about that.
[01:09:24.167 --> 01:09:30.933]  Sally, what was it like to learn that another CIA aircraft crashed in Mexico with 3.3 tons of pure cocaine?
[01:09:31.693 --> 01:09:37.979]  And, of course, that means it's coming directly from the source, and it turned out it was one of the torture aircraft the CIA was using for kidnapped people in the U.S.
[01:09:38.299 --> 01:09:41.482]  to fly them out of the country and fly drugs back in.
[01:09:41.502 --> 01:09:48.548]  I mean, did that surprise you to see that add to the list of hundreds of times that they've been caught with the cocaine and heroin in their hands?
[01:09:49.148 --> 01:09:52.890]  Well, no, not at all, because that's how they support their covert operations.
[01:09:52.930 --> 01:09:55.072]  That's how they did it in Central America.
[01:09:55.532 --> 01:10:00.535]  You know, they ran those drugs from South America into the U.S.
[01:10:00.575 --> 01:10:01.856]  for guns and brought them back.
[01:10:02.016 --> 01:10:08.140]  And, you know, you go back to the Vietnam War, Alex, you know, when they were smuggling the heroin in body bags.
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:15.364]  So, you know, there's always been consistency in the evidence of our government being complicit in drug trafficking.
[01:10:15.424 --> 01:10:16.985]  So it didn't surprise me at all when I
[01:10:17.452 --> 01:10:17.792]  I think so.
[01:10:33.742 --> 01:10:37.165]  Whether Mexico or Central America or back to Iraq.
[01:10:50.515 --> 01:11:04.560]  You also talked about thousands being killed every few months in Mexico, total drug war with CIA and bank-backed government, at war with real cartels that you said, from memory, about 20% of the business is theirs, 80% U.S.
[01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:05.020]  government.
[01:11:06.861 --> 01:11:10.163]  Yeah, what's coming in the future, Alex, is they're going to start taking out a lot of the federal agents
[01:11:36.683 --> 01:11:37.984]  For example, ATF.
[01:11:38.585 --> 01:11:49.194]  ATF has gone rogue warriors in the border here, and they're just arresting people, leaving the gun shows and this and that.
[01:11:49.594 --> 01:11:57.140]  And what's going to happen is they're going to start taking these guys out because they buy the weapons here in the U.S.
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:58.321]  And you know what, Alex?
[01:11:58.801 --> 01:12:01.604]  The majority of the weapons are going into Mexico.
[01:12:01.644 --> 01:12:03.165]  They're going to the military.
[01:12:04.191 --> 01:12:09.692]  Because the military has now built what is known as paramilitary, just like they did in Colombia.
[01:12:10.093 --> 01:12:11.433]  They're building them in Mexico.
[01:12:11.893 --> 01:12:13.273]  So they're mercs.
[01:12:13.553 --> 01:12:16.854]  They're going out and having scrimmages with the cartels.
[01:12:17.394 --> 01:12:22.036]  So they need the weapons for their own organization.
[01:12:22.056 --> 01:12:23.896]  And basically that's what they're doing.
[01:12:23.916 --> 01:12:31.018]  Just remember that the military's got those 50 cals and so forth, and they're nothing compared to the cartels.
[01:12:32.192 --> 01:12:36.173]  The military is heavily, heavily involved in drug trafficking to the U.S.
[01:12:36.273 --> 01:12:45.476]  and, you know, they ship, you know, a lot of weapons and a lot of money into Mexico via the border.
[01:12:46.196 --> 01:12:49.237]  And, of course, there's no exception.
[01:12:49.277 --> 01:13:00.341]  There's a couple of ATF agents that are on the payroll, a couple of, one FBI, I think, and several DEA agents who've been working for the cartels for many, many years, and they're still doing it.
[01:13:00.361 --> 01:13:01.481]  So they get intelligence.
[01:13:01.977 --> 01:13:08.481]  They know what's coming down the pipeline and who's being targeted and so forth.
[01:13:08.501 --> 01:13:16.706]  It's very well organized, but there's a lot of competition and a lot of freelancers, and that's when people are getting whacked.
[01:13:21.442 --> 01:13:22.523]  We just lost him.
[01:13:22.563 --> 01:13:23.504]  We just lost him.
[01:13:23.565 --> 01:13:26.748]  Let's get him back on the line there.
[01:13:27.689 --> 01:13:29.031]  That's why they don't want him out.
[01:13:29.231 --> 01:13:34.818]  By the way, he's been on Frontline, he's been on Nightline, he's been on Dateline.
[01:13:35.439 --> 01:13:36.980]  You can go to his website and see all those clips.
[01:13:41.601 --> 01:14:07.089]  It's just amazing that he's done all of this, went public, and he was there with Oliver North as they were loading the cocaine on, the planes in El Pongo, and then I can have Terry Reid on, who was CIA, at MENA with Bill Clinton and all them, and he's there just kind of running, keeping the aircraft in order, he'd done that and been a pilot, he was one of the trainers for the new CIA guys, and he was watching the cocaine land on the other end.
[01:14:08.189 --> 01:14:09.651]  And this is pure cocaine.
[01:14:09.671 --> 01:14:11.272]  I mean, it's coming directly from the source.
[01:14:12.053 --> 01:14:15.357]  And what they do in Colombia is, and this is even on our news, the U.S.
[01:14:15.397 --> 01:14:18.861]  spray planes in the war on drugs only spray the communist-owned coca.
[01:14:19.758 --> 01:14:20.718]  They don't spray this site.
[01:14:21.059 --> 01:14:30.122]  And I've talked to, and it's been in the news as well, but a lot of troops separately, not just in the news, have been in Afghanistan, where it's eight-fold what it was in 2001.
[01:14:30.763 --> 01:14:32.523]  And it's about double the previous record.
[01:14:32.543 --> 01:14:34.064]  It was only four-fold the previous record.
[01:14:34.324 --> 01:14:35.304]  So it's eight times.
[01:14:35.745 --> 01:14:39.066]  Heroin is just flooding Europe, flooding Asia, flooding the United States.
[01:14:39.606 --> 01:14:40.266]  Super cheap.
[01:14:40.286 --> 01:14:41.087]  Get everybody addicted.
[01:14:41.987 --> 01:14:43.648]  Just like the British brought down China that way.
[01:14:44.508 --> 01:14:48.490]  And I've talked to the troops who were there, and they say, yeah, we go and we guard
[01:14:49.548 --> 01:14:49.888]  Absolutely.
[01:14:49.908 --> 01:14:51.189]  We go to Mexico and Colombia and Peru and Bolivia.
[01:15:16.267 --> 01:15:25.694]  I remember at one time or another, we had the best satellite photos of all the coca plantations, the hectares and so forth, and we never sprayed them.
[01:15:25.874 --> 01:15:36.782]  We only sprayed a small amount to put on a Doc and Pony show, and every year we have a bigger production of cocaine coming into the U.S., and then heroin in Afghanistan, the same thing.
[01:15:36.842 --> 01:15:44.267]  Now we control Afghanistan, and we've got the biggest production harvest of heroin coming into the U.S., so it's going to tell you that
[01:15:45.034 --> 01:15:48.337]  The United States government is incomplicit in the drug trade.
[01:15:49.458 --> 01:15:50.059]  Simple as that.
[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:54.303]  I mean, how much more obvious selling Estella does it have to get for people?
[01:15:54.823 --> 01:16:09.237]  Well, basically what happens now, Alex, it's now one in three of the immediate families that are either using or selling drugs, so it's affecting the families and it's destroying the families, and basically that's why we have a lot of
[01:16:10.283 --> 01:16:38.365]  uh... one parent family you know and and and their parents are going to jail and listen to brothers and uncles and I knew I knew gorgeous girl smart the best in school turned into total crack whores you know I knew you had great friends handsome smart football players ruined and uh... the amount of poison that's in the illegal drugs when you decriminalize and all that poison isn't added to them and like the methamphetamine is the poison in it to make it because they're using other ingredients
[01:16:39.606 --> 01:16:44.189]  I mean, before drugs were illegal, this country was a lot better, weren't they?
[01:16:44.270 --> 01:16:45.370]  I mean, bottom line, Sully.
[01:16:45.951 --> 01:16:46.391]  Exactly.
[01:16:46.612 --> 01:16:47.993]  And, you know, we're continuing.
[01:16:48.033 --> 01:16:50.535]  That's why, you know, just remember one thing, Alex.
[01:16:50.575 --> 01:16:59.242]  We spend billions of dollars in forced countries like Colombia and Peru or Afghanistan to try to stop this so-called war on drugs.
[01:16:59.823 --> 01:17:00.603]  And it doesn't work.
[01:17:00.803 --> 01:17:01.764]  It has never worked.
[01:17:02.024 --> 01:17:03.726]  Law enforcement has never worked.
[01:17:04.246 --> 01:17:07.389]  We've got over 40 years of experience that has not worked.
[01:17:07.901 --> 01:17:13.242]  So the answer and the solution has got to be education, prevention, and treatment.
[01:17:14.243 --> 01:17:33.207]  As a member of LEAP, Law Enforcement Against Probation, you know, we need to educate the public that we've got to do something to stop probation, especially on marijuana and so forth, because it's hurting a lot of people and our civil liberties are being stamped on.
[01:17:34.889 --> 01:17:36.010]  You're absolutely right, Sully.
[01:17:36.130 --> 01:17:36.910]  Jason, jump in there.
[01:17:36.931 --> 01:17:37.491]  Jason Bermas.
[01:17:37.631 --> 01:17:58.506]  Yeah, you know, we were talking about the drug war with Jesse Ventura, and it just made me think to make the point that they do like people convicted of smaller crimes, these smaller drug crimes, even marijuanas, criminalized, to put people in the system into their privatized prisons so they can work for AT&T or Sprint for 39 cents an hour at slave wages and not have to outsource to third-world countries.
[01:17:58.927 --> 01:18:01.068]  So, for them, you know, it's a win-win.
[01:18:01.268 --> 01:18:03.110]  They're smuggling the stuff in dirt cheap,
[01:18:03.530 --> 01:18:09.354]  They're making a premium on it, and then the people that use it go to their privatized prisons to work slave labor for them.
[01:18:09.394 --> 01:18:11.016]  This system has to change, Alex.
[01:18:11.036 --> 01:18:14.298]  And then all these good old boys go, good, make them criminals work!
[01:18:14.398 --> 01:18:15.599]  But it's, it's, it's dry.
[01:18:15.659 --> 01:18:18.361]  I mean, you think somebody in India getting two bucks an hour is taking your job.
[01:18:18.621 --> 01:18:21.063]  You think somebody in Mexico making two bucks an hour is taking your job.
[01:18:21.123 --> 01:18:24.385]  Or here in the U.S., for four bucks, you know, some illegal immigrant.
[01:18:24.846 --> 01:18:25.726]  Well, forget them.
[01:18:26.667 --> 01:18:34.113]  The real threat to our jobs, and is the 4 million behind bars, another 4 million in the system, working for slave labor.
[01:18:34.153 --> 01:18:35.975]  And they make people work in these prisons.
[01:18:36.996 --> 01:18:42.180]  And people don't know, they're doing a lot of the telemarketing, they're booking flights for people.
[01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:44.182]  They are taking over the industries right now.
[01:18:45.279 --> 01:18:51.283]  Absolutely, and it's just incredible that the general populace is totally and completely ignorant to this fact.
[01:18:51.303 --> 01:18:59.068]  They really need to get involved and see what these private institutions are doing, how they interact with one another, and really how it is a control grid for the common man.
[01:18:59.288 --> 01:19:05.852]  You know, I had a couple friends, unfortunately, this year succumb to heroin addiction and have to go to rehab, and they're still struggling with it.
[01:19:06.513 --> 01:19:09.695]  These are people I would have never thought, Alex, and it's just crazy to me.
[01:19:10.215 --> 01:19:11.476]  And, you know, we're not out there to help them.
[01:19:11.496 --> 01:19:12.957]  We're really out there to imprison them.
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:19.003]  Well, I mean, the people shipping it in are the ones that are running the police, and there's no doubt of that.
[01:19:19.043 --> 01:19:19.764]  Everybody knows it.
[01:19:19.784 --> 01:19:20.564]  We're just tired of it.
[01:19:20.584 --> 01:19:22.005]  We're tired of your criminal activities.
[01:19:22.706 --> 01:19:25.988]  That's why I tell young people, don't ever use drugs that first time.
[01:19:26.288 --> 01:19:29.150]  And I'm not talking about a few beers or, you know, even somebody smoking marijuana.
[01:19:29.170 --> 01:19:31.972]  The problem is, that brings you into cultures.
[01:19:32.132 --> 01:19:34.254]  It is a gateway to the stronger drugs.
[01:19:35.354 --> 01:19:40.238]  And what kills more people is prescription drugs and the Ritalin and the Prozac than all illegal drugs combined.
[01:19:40.258 --> 01:19:40.978]  You can look at those numbers.
[01:19:40.998 --> 01:19:41.759]  It's just staggering.
[01:19:42.699 --> 01:19:44.300]  But, you know, alcohol is very dangerous.
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:45.401]  Cigarettes are dangerous.
[01:19:46.422 --> 01:19:48.563]  You know, thank God I never got into hard drugs.
[01:19:48.643 --> 01:19:50.684]  I tried them once or twice and always hated the way they made me feel.
[01:19:51.064 --> 01:19:53.065]  But I struggle with alcohol, cigarettes.
[01:19:53.105 --> 01:19:56.327]  I mean, I have a serious issue with those because, I mean, I'm like a ping-pong.
[01:19:56.447 --> 01:19:58.469]  Not a lot of alcohol, but drink a few beers, smoke cigarettes.
[01:19:58.529 --> 01:19:59.129]  It's not good for me.
[01:19:59.409 --> 01:20:00.890]  Then I get off of it, get back on it.
[01:20:01.230 --> 01:20:03.672]  So, I mean, imagine going to prison for cigarettes and beer.
[01:20:04.232 --> 01:20:17.640]  You know, but I mean, that's basically, because cigarettes affect the same areas of the brain and has the, you know, in a CAT scan, or a scan of the brain, it lights up the same areas as cocaine and heroin.
[01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:19.801]  Do we put cigarette smokers in prison?
[01:20:20.942 --> 01:20:21.242]  Sally?
[01:20:21.802 --> 01:20:26.105]  Yeah, you know, it's just, it's amazing how they're doing this.
[01:20:26.265 --> 01:20:32.829]  And you know, one of the things I think that you might have missed, Alex, is the fact that once you're a convicted felon, you don't vote.
[01:20:34.096 --> 01:20:39.039]  So that's a good way of trying to suppress a lot of the people from voting.
[01:20:39.439 --> 01:20:44.282]  They're also destroying the economy, so everybody's got to join the military, because that's all that's left is government jobs.
[01:20:44.302 --> 01:20:49.805]  That's all there's left, and a lot of people are getting hurt by going into the military.
[01:20:49.865 --> 01:20:54.668]  And remember, they're looking for survival, and hoping that they won't get hurt.
[01:20:54.888 --> 01:21:00.011]  And once they do get hurt, they lose a limb or something, then they know they commit suicide.
[01:21:00.273 --> 01:21:05.574]  Well, Selly, let's give out, you're saying the best place for people is to email you at this address.
[01:21:06.034 --> 01:21:08.534]  Right, at PowderBurnsAtProdigy.net.
[01:21:08.674 --> 01:21:19.776]  You can send your donations there, because I do need to pay my attorney now, and I have to pay for that appeal on the sentencing, so if you please could help, and I would certainly appreciate it.
[01:21:20.416 --> 01:21:27.758]  And once again, you can go straight to my email address at PowderBurnsAtProdigy.net, or you can call me at 956-345-4000.
[01:21:30.220 --> 01:21:38.568]  I certainly thank you Alex for what you're doing for me.
[01:21:38.628 --> 01:21:49.677]  The judge was great at giving me self-surrender on March 5th, so he gave me plenty of time to take care of my family before I leave.
[01:21:51.150 --> 01:21:54.232]  You know, I certainly do appreciate that the judges give me that.
[01:21:54.292 --> 01:22:03.677]  Well, they know they're sending an innocent person to jail for fake gun laws put into place by the drug-dealing government, so they can imprison American citizens and have a reason to harass us.
[01:22:03.737 --> 01:22:06.759]  You know, Alex, I might be incarcerated, but I'll never be silent.
[01:22:06.879 --> 01:22:12.042]  You know, I'll do my activism from inside, and then when I get out, I'll do the same thing.
[01:22:12.102 --> 01:22:17.985]  I'll continue to educate the public, and basically that's the big answer to a lot of our problems.
[01:22:18.587 --> 01:22:30.218]  People are not aware of what's going on, whether it's with a drug issue or suppression of other stuff, but we need to educate the public, and you're certainly doing a great job on that.
[01:22:30.499 --> 01:22:34.563]  Well, Sully, stay in touch with us as this unfolds and develops, and thanks for getting in touch with us.
[01:22:34.763 --> 01:22:35.043]  Okay.
[01:22:35.223 --> 01:22:36.745]  Thank you so much, Alex, for having me.
[01:22:36.805 --> 01:22:37.345]  You bet.
[01:22:38.406 --> 01:22:38.967]  Sully, you still there?
[01:22:39.668 --> 01:22:40.028]  Okay, great.
[01:22:40.048 --> 01:22:40.368]  He's gone.
[01:22:40.388 --> 01:22:40.929]  I thought he'd hung up.
[01:22:42.236 --> 01:22:43.997]  Yeah, and again, when it rains it pours.
[01:22:44.017 --> 01:22:47.379]  This day is like, help this Senator out, you know, help Sully Costillo out.
[01:22:47.399 --> 01:22:49.160]  You know, that's so many people.
[01:22:49.761 --> 01:22:50.481]  We try to help.
[01:22:50.521 --> 01:22:53.423]  We try to be a platform and we ask the listeners for a lot.
[01:22:53.943 --> 01:23:02.408]  You know, I only ask the listeners to support our sponsors and get our books and videos because this is not cheap doing this and operating here.
[01:23:02.809 --> 01:23:05.550]  And I want to get into this Rothschild news and a few other news stories at the end of the show.
[01:23:05.570 --> 01:23:07.251]  It looks like we're not going to have time to get to those calls.
[01:23:08.132 --> 01:23:09.833]  And Burmese, let's just set this up now.
[01:23:11.550 --> 01:23:19.996]  Let's have you fill in a full day one day this week, and then maybe one or two hours the other day.
[01:23:20.016 --> 01:23:25.799]  Because I've got so much to get done, plus you're one of the few people out there who can really actually do the show well.
[01:23:26.079 --> 01:23:35.325]  We've had a lot of people fill in and do the show, have done a great job, but you hold the internet numbers, which we use as a gauge, at the closest to what I'm able to hold them at, and we use that as a gauge.
[01:23:36.246 --> 01:23:47.790]  For the listeners, so that's certainly good to have you when you are here in town, and I can't wait to hear your studio set up up there in upstate New York, because then you can fill in on this show.
[01:23:48.271 --> 01:23:52.112]  And then maybe I'll have you some days when I'm out of town, and maybe Bob Dacey together or something.
[01:23:52.672 --> 01:23:53.993]  Go back and forth, that's a good mix.
[01:23:55.393 --> 01:23:59.515]  Speaking of funding, our sponsors are how we pay for this show.
[01:24:00.991 --> 01:24:07.076]  And we're going to go to break here in a minute, come back and hit a few final news stories, but I want to tell you on air about who does make this show possible.
[01:24:07.537 --> 01:24:11.220]  This is what supports us, and we appreciate you doing that, especially in these hard times.
[01:24:12.401 --> 01:24:14.763]  But the other thing is, I only get sponsors I believe in.
[01:24:16.118 --> 01:24:17.479]  And we have four big sponsors.
[01:24:17.559 --> 01:24:21.860]  eFoods Direct, Cola Blue, New Vitality, and Food Shortage USA.
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:23.261]  Let me tell you about eFoods Direct.
[01:24:23.281 --> 01:24:27.082]  They are the longest continually operating storable foods company in the nation.
[01:24:27.482 --> 01:24:29.683]  They are where I have chosen to get my storable foods.
[01:24:31.704 --> 01:24:33.705]  Bought food for other family that couldn't afford it.
[01:24:33.785 --> 01:24:35.085]  Yes, I really believe all this.
[01:24:35.165 --> 01:24:55.990]  I really believe they're setting up a depression and see it's all happening and I really believe the new world order is poisoning and killing us and see I happen to have the documents so I don't trust them and I know I'll never stand in a bread line because I have my own bread and I'm not going to the Superdome and I'm not going to a FEMA camp and it's my job to take care of my family so I've got food that'll last more than 10 years in climate control, 10 years climate controlled, high quality, freeze-dried and
[01:24:57.071 --> 01:25:00.636]  Also, dehydrated, so it's jam-packed in the cans.
[01:25:00.696 --> 01:25:04.082]  It's condensed, so a lot fits in a small place.
[01:25:04.102 --> 01:25:04.482]  800-409-5633.
[01:25:04.502 --> 01:25:04.562]  800-409-5633.
[01:25:04.582 --> 01:25:05.224]  Call and get a free...
[01:25:11.112 --> 01:25:14.795]  Brochure, a free catalog, or a free audio CD about what they have to offer, 800-409-5633.
[01:25:14.835 --> 01:25:21.340]  And Steve Schenck, the owner of the company, also has his own show from 6 to 8 p.m.
[01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:24.682]  Sunday nights after my Sunday, an abbreviated two-hour program.
[01:25:25.203 --> 01:25:27.224]  You can also go to efoodsdirect.com.
[01:25:27.244 --> 01:25:28.905]  Then there's also a Cola Blue.
[01:25:30.166 --> 01:25:33.209]  This is the amazing atmospheric water generator.
[01:25:35.245 --> 01:25:36.706]  By the way, Willie has his own brand of these.
[01:25:37.207 --> 01:25:37.788]  They're really neat.
[01:25:37.808 --> 01:25:38.669]  Ventura couldn't believe it.
[01:25:39.249 --> 01:25:44.155]  Seven gallons or more, but in the desert about three gallons a day with the basic unit.
[01:25:44.556 --> 01:25:46.738]  Very affordable atmospheric water generator for your home.
[01:25:46.778 --> 01:25:49.421]  Pays for itself in one year if you buy your water from the store.
[01:25:49.502 --> 01:25:50.783]  Pure, clean water without the fluoride.
[01:25:52.046 --> 01:25:54.928]  Unlimited water from the humidity in the air, 7.5 gallons a day.
[01:25:55.268 --> 01:25:57.529]  Rate tasting pure H2O, exactly the way nature makes it.
[01:25:57.669 --> 01:25:58.489]  Neutral pH.
[01:25:58.729 --> 01:26:01.371]  Then it goes through five other filters, so it's no fluoride.
[01:26:01.391 --> 01:26:02.871]  866-585-4044, 1-866-585-4044, or acolablue.com.
[01:26:02.891 --> 01:26:04.172]  Had four hours to plug my sponsors.
[01:26:04.192 --> 01:26:05.392]  I'm just so focused on the info.
[01:26:12.876 --> 01:26:14.197]  Never really plug the videos anymore.
[01:26:14.217 --> 01:26:15.258]  I need to plug Fabled Enemies.
[01:26:15.638 --> 01:26:16.438]  This week you can do it.
[01:26:16.458 --> 01:26:17.059]  That's a good film.
[01:26:17.099 --> 01:26:17.759]  Needs to get out there.
[01:26:18.099 --> 01:26:19.560]  But again at Coloblue.com.
[01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:22.362]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com.
[01:26:23.023 --> 01:26:26.885]  And in closing here with the sponsors, Food Shortage USA.
[01:26:27.325 --> 01:26:27.986]  Fabulous folks.
[01:26:28.006 --> 01:26:31.428]  They tell you how inexpensively in your own home to store food.
[01:26:31.468 --> 01:26:36.892]  They tell you the secrets to doing that.
[01:26:37.961 --> 01:26:40.463]  And it's FoodShortageUSA.com.
[01:26:40.523 --> 01:26:41.923]  FoodShortageUSA.com.
[01:26:41.943 --> 01:26:42.664]  Go check it out.
[01:26:43.544 --> 01:26:44.685]  They're not even selling food.
[01:26:44.945 --> 01:26:46.666]  It's literature and videos and materials.
[01:26:46.726 --> 01:26:47.127]  Learn that.
[01:26:47.427 --> 01:26:48.367]  FoodShortageUSA.com or 877-327-0365.
[01:26:48.387 --> 01:26:48.427]  877-327-0365.
[01:26:48.467 --> 01:26:49.248]  FoodShortageUSA.com.
[01:26:49.268 --> 01:26:49.748]  We'll be right back.
[01:26:59.588 --> 01:27:07.354]  You know what, we've had so much time here that I haven't even gotten to this and I don't want to not spend time on FoodShortageUSA.com, at least for the internet audience.
[01:27:07.374 --> 01:27:08.595]  I'm going to give them an extra plug here.
[01:27:09.376 --> 01:27:10.316]  Just great materials.
[01:27:10.917 --> 01:27:17.262]  Go to FoodShortageUSA.com to learn how to make your own storable foods for you and your family to prepare for the road ahead.
[01:27:17.282 --> 01:27:21.785]  The website reveals a step-by-step way for the average guy to get prepared for what's ahead.
[01:27:21.805 --> 01:27:27.550]  I think the best part about the system is it gets you off the food grid even if you don't have a lot of money to spend on this site.
[01:27:27.910 --> 01:27:29.571]  Again, it's foodshortageusa.com.
[01:27:30.332 --> 01:27:31.092]  It's not too late.
[01:27:31.152 --> 01:27:37.076]  You can still prepare by learning how to make your own survival foods, and you can do this for pennies a day, or pennies on the dollar.
[01:27:37.336 --> 01:27:38.517]  Go to foodshortageusa.com or 877-327-0365.
[01:27:38.537 --> 01:27:41.219]  Hold off on that Rothschild thing until we get back to the full audience here at the end.
[01:27:47.583 --> 01:27:48.565]  A little bit dingy today.
[01:27:48.585 --> 01:27:51.830]  I had like three and a half hours sleep after two wild days with Jesse Ventura.
[01:27:51.850 --> 01:27:55.155]  And an afternoon with Willie Nelson.
[01:27:55.496 --> 01:27:57.319]  And an evening that was quite insane.
[01:27:59.665 --> 01:28:05.692]  You know, I got to this top story at the start of the show, and I really can't do justice to it.
[01:28:06.553 --> 01:28:11.558]  Senator predicts a revolution if banks don't lend, and Senator says that basically they're hoarding all the money.
[01:28:11.679 --> 01:28:12.840]  Senator Dodd, same thing we've said.
[01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:13.701]  That's in the New York Times.
[01:28:14.221 --> 01:28:16.404]  And Paul did a great story on it on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:28:16.424 --> 01:28:17.345]  Burmish, your take on this?
[01:28:17.645 --> 01:28:18.386]  Well, obviously.
[01:28:18.446 --> 01:28:19.506]  I mean, what did they say?
[01:28:19.546 --> 01:28:25.470]  They gave their first $25 billion to Chase Manhattan, but they have no interest whatsoever in loaning out any of that money.
[01:28:25.850 --> 01:28:28.032]  And all they're going to do is recapitalize themselves.
[01:28:28.052 --> 01:28:29.072]  Well, that's not a shocker.
[01:28:29.973 --> 01:28:30.754]  Let's be clear.
[01:28:30.814 --> 01:28:31.594]  Gave them the money.
[01:28:31.834 --> 01:28:33.515]  These aren't just regular Federal Reserve loans.
[01:28:33.555 --> 01:28:34.316]  It's just, here, have it.
[01:28:34.516 --> 01:28:35.096]  Yeah.
[01:28:35.136 --> 01:28:36.317]  This is not a loan, folks.
[01:28:36.357 --> 01:28:38.619]  We gave them this money.
[01:28:38.719 --> 01:28:40.800]  And Chase Manhattan is not going down.
[01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:42.041]  Me and you both know that, Alex.
[01:28:42.061 --> 01:28:42.961]  This is a rock and roll loan.
[01:28:42.981 --> 01:28:43.722]  It's the kingpin.
[01:28:43.942 --> 01:28:44.322]  Yeah!
[01:28:44.342 --> 01:28:45.323]  They're running the whole show!
[01:28:45.383 --> 01:28:45.844]  Exactly!
[01:28:45.864 --> 01:28:48.346]  They're the biggest of the banks.
[01:28:48.667 --> 01:28:49.848]  They're not going anywhere.
[01:28:50.088 --> 01:28:52.450]  They're the last people that need this $25 billion.
[01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:56.534]  Why didn't that $25 billion, Alex, go to the local banks that do have a shot at going out?
[01:28:56.754 --> 01:28:58.536]  Going to the people that really need it the most.
[01:28:58.596 --> 01:28:59.437]  It didn't go there, did it?
[01:28:59.837 --> 01:29:01.218]  It went to this empire!
[01:29:01.799 --> 01:29:05.502]  And, you know, I can't remember his name, but there's... It's also international.
[01:29:05.542 --> 01:29:06.543]  Most of it's going offshore.
[01:29:06.583 --> 01:29:07.364]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:29:07.464 --> 01:29:08.785]  And their tie, I think it's...
[01:29:10.066 --> 01:29:14.829]  Man, I can't remember the name, but he's basically saying, yeah, we're going to recapitalize our banks.
[01:29:15.189 --> 01:29:17.251]  We really can't give out any new loans.
[01:29:17.391 --> 01:29:18.932]  I wouldn't expect that to happen.
[01:29:19.012 --> 01:29:21.694]  In fact, I would expect less loans to be going out.
[01:29:21.914 --> 01:29:22.714]  So here's how it works.
[01:29:22.734 --> 01:29:24.535]  We're going to get $5 trillion of your money.
[01:29:24.575 --> 01:29:26.276]  That's what they're admitting, and it's not $700 billion.
[01:29:26.777 --> 01:29:30.139]  We're going to get, you've heard Ron Paul say that, it's in Bloomberg as well, $5 trillion.
[01:29:30.799 --> 01:29:34.242]  And you can't even see who we're giving it to or see the secret contracts.
[01:29:34.702 --> 01:29:39.465]  And we're also paying around brokerage firms hundreds of billions of dollars at the end of the day to hand out the trillion.
[01:29:39.645 --> 01:29:46.737]  And not only will there never be any oversight over this bill, but it will never be able to be reviewed by any agency, anytime, anywhere, ever.
[01:29:46.897 --> 01:29:49.081]  And if Congress doesn't like it, they tell them publicly.
[01:29:49.969 --> 01:29:51.730]  North Com and the military standing by.
[01:29:52.110 --> 01:29:55.912]  You're going to stand here while we take all your money and destroy your future, and you're going to pay it all back in taxes.
[01:29:56.313 --> 01:30:02.916]  They get the money, we pay for it, and the tax man... I mean, there's more cops, more checkpoints, more tickets, more IRS grabbing houses.
[01:30:03.217 --> 01:30:06.499]  They are just going to squeeze us and squeeze us and squeeze us and squeeze us.
[01:30:06.539 --> 01:30:06.859]  That's right.
[01:30:06.899 --> 01:30:13.523]  They basically threaten members of Congress with mass bank closures, the little guys, and then that would create... We're going back to the full audience.
[01:30:13.563 --> 01:30:13.803]  Go ahead.
[01:30:13.863 --> 01:30:14.083]  Here we go.
[01:30:16.863 --> 01:30:17.884]  Strange days are here.
[01:30:17.904 --> 01:30:19.646]  Finish up with what you were talking about, the banks.
[01:30:20.106 --> 01:30:29.736]  Yeah, I was just mentioning how, you know, they threaten members of Congress by saying all these small banks are going to go under, we're going to have riots in the streets, we're going to have to put the military on the streets and declare martial law.
[01:30:29.796 --> 01:30:30.357]  No big deal.
[01:30:30.397 --> 01:30:33.220]  So please pass this bailout so we don't have to strong-arm you.
[01:30:33.740 --> 01:30:35.701]  You know, but that is a strong-arm tactic.
[01:30:35.761 --> 01:30:37.821]  It's unbelievable we stood up for it, Alex.
[01:30:38.021 --> 01:30:42.243]  It's unbelievable that not one person in the mainstream media even reported on that.
[01:30:42.643 --> 01:30:49.185]  Thank God for C-SPAN, because without it we wouldn't even know these members of Congress had been threatened in private meetings.
[01:30:52.426 --> 01:30:53.846]  Well, maybe they're with Al-Qaeda.
[01:30:55.107 --> 01:30:58.408]  You don't let the bankers have everything, you're with Al-Qaeda, boy.
[01:30:59.465 --> 01:31:01.667]  You don't get rid of America, you're not patriotic.
[01:31:01.687 --> 01:31:03.508]  You know, and speaking of bankers... Yeah, let's get into that.
[01:31:03.728 --> 01:31:09.112]  This is a good transition, because the Rothschild family is one of these massive banking families.
[01:31:09.152 --> 01:31:14.537]  And here it is, The Telegraph, one of the biggest papers in London.
[01:31:14.857 --> 01:31:17.839]  I'm not reading this off Prison Planet or Infowars.com.
[01:31:17.859 --> 01:31:20.561]  This is mainline media.
[01:31:20.601 --> 01:31:23.944]  And let me just read the first couple paragraphs, and we'll get into it and why it's important.
[01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:38.194]  Rather than the eclectic group of Richard Pley, the shadow chancellor in Europe was unwittingly made privy to a closely guarded relationship between Mendelssohn and the Rothschild family that spanned nearly two decades.
[01:31:38.214 --> 01:31:41.978]  By the way, news, the media, a decade ago, it said the Rothschilds didn't exist.
[01:31:42.478 --> 01:31:47.385]  Yeah, and now they're saying, oh, well, they have a two-decade relationship with the Parliament, you know?
[01:31:47.805 --> 01:31:48.226]  Absolutely.
[01:31:48.766 --> 01:32:00.502]  During this time, their business and personal lives had become entwined many times, including on this occasion with their mutual friend, the Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska, and had forged a far stronger bond than
[01:32:00.882 --> 01:32:04.423]  But it turns out every time they bust an oligarch, it's really a Rothschild front in Russia.
[01:32:04.483 --> 01:32:07.503]  Yeah, yeah, with university chum and host Nathaniel Rothschild.
[01:32:07.883 --> 01:32:13.025]  Now, why am I getting into this other than the fact that they're showing that the Rothschilds and the government have a huge relationship?
[01:32:13.505 --> 01:32:17.546]  Well, it was Nathaniel Rothschild that rolled on this shadow chancellor.
[01:32:17.946 --> 01:32:18.246]  Why?
[01:32:18.666 --> 01:32:22.627]  Now, what he's saying is, and John Harmon's got the clip, I don't know if we're actually going to be able to get to it.
[01:32:22.647 --> 01:32:23.507]  How long is that clip, Harmon?
[01:32:23.527 --> 01:32:24.107]  About five minutes.
[01:32:25.054 --> 01:32:37.718]  But it basically states that Rothschild wrote in to one of the main papers, a letter to the editor, said that this billionaire in Russia was giving Mendelsohn and the shadow chancellor illegal funds and he's trying to burn them.
[01:32:38.078 --> 01:32:39.378]  Why is he trying to burn them?
[01:32:39.398 --> 01:32:46.240]  Well we know because the oligarchs were fronts for the Rothschilds, that's come out in the financial times of London, and so they're now, might be losing some control, probably trying to burn him.
[01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:49.361]  Exactly, it makes me think that the shadow chancellor... Well we know that's happened before.
[01:32:49.381 --> 01:32:51.421]  Yeah, is probably going against one of their policies.
[01:32:51.582 --> 01:32:53.302]  And now... No, these guys fight with each other.
[01:32:53.362 --> 01:32:53.985]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:32:54.045 --> 01:32:56.255]  Hey, is that clip up on InfoWars?
[01:32:56.557 --> 01:32:58.385]  We'll post that Rothschild clip.
[01:32:59.189 --> 01:33:01.971]  I've got Aaron out there editing all this Willie video that's going up.
[01:33:02.471 --> 01:33:07.014]  Oh, look for that this evening to go viral at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:33:07.034 --> 01:33:07.394]  You know what?
[01:33:07.915 --> 01:33:10.216]  When you fill in on the show tomorrow or Wednesday, play the clip.
[01:33:10.356 --> 01:33:11.877]  Yeah, we will definitely play that clip.
[01:33:12.958 --> 01:33:14.479]  Yes, John Harmon will have it.
[01:33:14.519 --> 01:33:16.200]  The great guy over at GCN.
[01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:17.181]  Harmy and Burmy.
[01:33:18.622 --> 01:33:19.122]  I love John.
[01:33:19.162 --> 01:33:20.383]  He does a great job for this network.
[01:33:20.643 --> 01:33:21.544]  Everybody here does a great job.
[01:33:21.564 --> 01:33:22.485]  And Paul's got a nickname.
[01:33:22.505 --> 01:33:22.985]  What is it?
[01:33:23.345 --> 01:33:23.685]  Hoosh?
[01:33:24.866 --> 01:33:27.208]  Hoosh, Burmy, Harmy.
[01:33:28.342 --> 01:33:29.163]  What about Jacobson?
[01:33:29.563 --> 01:33:30.624]  What about Robbie?
[01:33:31.245 --> 01:33:32.606]  Robbie?
[01:33:33.767 --> 01:33:36.850]  We've got to give Ventura... Ventura?
[01:33:36.870 --> 01:33:38.111]  I don't want to give him a nickname.
[01:33:38.391 --> 01:33:42.415]  He'll probably end up in my bedroom at 3 in the morning staring at me like a CL1.
[01:33:42.555 --> 01:33:49.681]  Some of the stuff he's like, if you tell anybody what I've told you, just remember I will be in your bedroom years from now and you don't expect it.
[01:33:49.961 --> 01:33:51.563]  We don't get angry, we get even.
[01:33:52.063 --> 01:33:53.224]  And we take our time.
[01:33:53.284 --> 01:33:55.085]  It doesn't have to be today, Alex.
[01:33:55.125 --> 01:33:56.485]  It doesn't have to be tomorrow.
[01:33:56.545 --> 01:33:58.646]  It could be a week, a month, or a year from now.
[01:33:59.587 --> 01:34:01.188]  You know how I deal with poachers?
[01:34:02.348 --> 01:34:04.309]  You know how I deal with poachers on my little lake?
[01:34:05.490 --> 01:34:11.253]  I strap my 9mm to my side and I go right up to them, Alex, and I let them know, this is a private lake.
[01:34:11.293 --> 01:34:12.913]  Who gave you permission to go here?
[01:34:13.914 --> 01:34:15.755]  And you know what happens if they give me crap?
[01:34:17.645 --> 01:34:20.287]  I take their bike, Alex, and I bring it to the police.
[01:34:20.767 --> 01:34:21.808]  I take their crap.
[01:34:22.328 --> 01:34:23.909]  I take them to the police myself.
