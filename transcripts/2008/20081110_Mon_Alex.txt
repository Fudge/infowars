[00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:00.969]  Gold is up by $13.20 today.
[00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:02.650]  A little bit of economic news coming up later.
[00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.311]  But I shut open phones in this fourth and final hour.
[00:00:25.232 --> 00:00:25.493]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:00:25.513 --> 00:00:32.399]  We are live at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.785]  Also, I've been telling this story all day, but I'm going to show it later in the hour.
[00:00:40.826 --> 00:00:42.488]  I was at my parents' house.
[00:00:42.728 --> 00:00:43.749]  I'm mainly an internet person.
[00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:46.451]  There's not a lot of newspapers and magazines around the house anymore.
[00:00:46.952 --> 00:00:49.154]  I read them all online, but I was rummaging through their stuff.
[00:00:50.316 --> 00:01:00.279]  And it's just every magazine, every newspaper, it has Barack Obama saving the Earth, saving the Bill of Rights, saving the Constitution.
[00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:05.640]  And South Park last week did a piece making fun of it, and they're not even exaggerating.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.142]  I mean, it's people just saying, all my problems are solved, Barack Obama is God.
[00:01:10.162 --> 00:01:13.943]  I want to show one of these on the document cam now.
[00:01:13.983 --> 00:01:14.783]  We'll show more later.
[00:01:17.284 --> 00:01:18.945]  And I literally dug around for about three minutes.
[00:01:18.965 --> 00:01:19.825]  This is just everywhere.
[00:01:20.725 --> 00:01:21.745]  I'm sure you're seeing this.
[00:01:21.785 --> 00:01:30.108]  In fact, mail them in to me at the mailing address on the website and I'll do a whole show in the future just showing all the magazine articles and editorials where he's gone.
[00:01:31.268 --> 00:01:36.050]  If you look at this shot, it's on the document cam at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.011]  This is out of Newsweek Magazine.
[00:01:40.551 --> 00:01:46.734]  There he is, putting the Constitution, with all these little pieces of tape, and he's putting the last piece in, dutifully.
[00:01:47.235 --> 00:01:53.178]  He's got his tape, and he's in the Oval Office, and day one, he's putting it back together.
[00:01:53.318 --> 00:01:58.640]  Folks, this guy wants compulsory national service, gun control, disarming you.
[00:01:59.021 --> 00:02:03.363]  That's ripping huge pieces out of the Constitution.
[00:02:04.588 --> 00:02:06.629]  I mean, how much of this do we have to put up with?
[00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.091]  How much crap do we have to put up with?
[00:02:09.131 --> 00:02:12.013]  Well, I'm going to be exposing Mr. Obama.
[00:02:12.333 --> 00:02:17.396]  Not that he runs anything, but as the front man, how much they can get through on their agenda.
[00:02:17.917 --> 00:02:19.158]  I mean, I would love to...
[00:02:23.752 --> 00:02:33.556]  I would love to be able to like Barack Obama, but I'm sorry, I would have loved to have been able to like George Bush, but I'm about policies and what they actually do versus rhetoric.
[00:02:34.136 --> 00:02:36.037]  So there is your savior, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:36.317 --> 00:02:38.478]  We'll be going over that later in the hour.
[00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.099]  Right now, let's go ahead and go back to your calls.
[00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:44.100]  Pull my call list up here.
[00:02:45.221 --> 00:02:47.001]  Let's talk to Brandon in New York.
[00:02:47.021 --> 00:02:47.942]  You're on the air, Brandon.
[00:02:47.962 --> 00:02:50.503]  Hey Alex, how are you doing today?
[00:02:50.563 --> 00:02:50.983]  Pretty good.
[00:02:51.543 --> 00:02:51.843]  Thank you.
[00:02:51.863 --> 00:02:53.344]  Thank you for having me on your show.
[00:02:54.042 --> 00:02:59.686]  I have been listening to you for quite some time now, and I would also like to thank you for opening my mind, sir.
[00:03:00.306 --> 00:03:07.471]  People like you that are actually doing greatness for the people in the United States, unlike the scumbag elites that are trying to control us.
[00:03:08.611 --> 00:03:15.556]  I'm actually talking to you today because I'm up here in New York at what is dubbed by the common people as Mission Control.
[00:03:16.256 --> 00:03:19.138]  We're a hub that basically monitors the internet.
[00:03:20.058 --> 00:03:23.482]  And I found an article today that I think you would be really interested in.
[00:03:23.562 --> 00:03:25.204]  It's in the Los Angeles Times.
[00:03:26.165 --> 00:03:33.833]  And it's basically showing how there are different corporations such as AT&T, Comcast, Time Warner, Fairpoint.
[00:03:34.213 --> 00:03:37.437]  And what they're doing is they're actually putting a cap on the Internet.
[00:03:38.155 --> 00:03:44.180]  And how much information you can actually bring into and from your ISPs.
[00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.242]  Yeah, no, that's getting rid of net neutrality.
[00:03:46.262 --> 00:03:48.184]  They're also going to restrict the number of sites you can visit.
[00:03:48.684 --> 00:04:02.015]  And people are emailing me saying I'm conspiracy-theoring when it's admitted by them and governments are saying they're encouraging ISPs and providers like Comcast and others and Time Warner to now shut people off.
[00:04:02.035 --> 00:04:03.497]  I mean, it's already happening!
[00:04:04.017 --> 00:04:04.317]  It is.
[00:04:04.738 --> 00:04:11.361]  And there's Cyblock proxies, there's Cybin proxies for reporting servers, Log Analyze servers.
[00:04:11.842 --> 00:04:16.604]  I mean, the general public should know, anytime you're on the internet, all those things are being recorded.
[00:04:16.924 --> 00:04:21.227]  Don't think that your ISP provider isn't looking at all the information that you're looking up.
[00:04:21.807 --> 00:04:22.488]  And let's be specific.
[00:04:45.123 --> 00:04:49.404]  You signed up and are paying for that and then I'm paying to stream it to you.
[00:04:49.964 --> 00:05:03.626]  They're just hijacking the web just like they're hijacking our entire banking system right now and literally feeding the Treasury and all of our currency and our tax money directly into themselves.
[00:05:04.327 --> 00:05:05.867]  I mean, folks, they're going for broke.
[00:05:05.887 --> 00:05:07.987]  They're taking it all down right now.
[00:05:08.067 --> 00:05:08.427]  Stay there.
[00:05:09.308 --> 00:05:11.748]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:05:12.563 --> 00:05:15.245]  Patrick Henry said, give me liberty or give me death.
[00:05:15.946 --> 00:05:32.119]  Did you know that he also forced the adoption of the Bill of Rights as a part of the Constitution of 1787 to guarantee your unalienable or unchangeable rights of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom to own a gun to protect our nation from tyranny.
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.264]  There is now an assault upon the unalienable, unchangeable rights to deprive you of them.
[00:05:39.079 --> 00:05:47.024]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[00:05:48.025 --> 00:05:48.545]  Just call 1-800-516-8736.
[00:05:48.565 --> 00:05:48.885]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:05:48.925 --> 00:05:50.326]  The call is free.
[00:05:50.346 --> 00:05:54.469]  Our operators are standing by to take your order for a year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[00:06:08.829 --> 00:06:15.193]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:06:15.573 --> 00:06:17.554]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:06:18.215 --> 00:06:19.255]  But who is the enemy?
[00:06:19.756 --> 00:06:20.316]  Bin Laden.
[00:06:20.556 --> 00:06:21.497]  This is his ammo.
[00:06:21.517 --> 00:06:22.858]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:06:22.878 --> 00:06:24.579]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:31.683]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:06:32.063 --> 00:06:32.503]  Some U.S.
[00:06:32.543 --> 00:06:38.207]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:06:38.887 --> 00:06:42.368]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:06:42.388 --> 00:06:45.189]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:07:08.638 --> 00:07:11.680]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.402]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:07:15.882 --> 00:07:21.825]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[00:07:22.206 --> 00:07:26.348]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[00:07:26.848 --> 00:07:32.572]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[00:07:32.852 --> 00:07:35.933]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:07:36.274 --> 00:07:36.934]  Run some pumps,
[00:07:40.196 --> 00:07:40.676]  Spoiling.
[00:07:40.916 --> 00:07:46.859]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:07:47.139 --> 00:07:51.761]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready with the solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[00:07:52.121 --> 00:07:56.103]  Go to mysolarbackup.com and get off the grid today.
[00:07:56.443 --> 00:07:58.244]  That's mysolarbackup.com today.
[00:07:58.264 --> 00:07:58.744]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[00:07:58.764 --> 00:07:58.844]  877-327-0365.
[00:07:58.864 --> 00:07:59.504]  Don't wait.
[00:07:59.624 --> 00:08:00.004]  Call today.
[00:08:13.522 --> 00:08:21.765]  We are back live and we were talking to one of the callers who was discussing the fact that
[00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:47.351]  His ISP is restricting the amount of downloads, the amount of data he can take onto his computer.
[00:08:48.392 --> 00:08:52.432]  And again, these are pitiful amounts of bandwidth.
[00:08:53.013 --> 00:08:56.213]  His subscription way more than pays for it.
[00:08:56.813 --> 00:09:03.955]  But in most towns, even big cities, you'll have two or three providers you can go through for fast downloads, for fast connections.
[00:09:03.995 --> 00:09:06.896]  You can get your DSL, the phone company, your cable modem.
[00:09:07.961 --> 00:09:19.367]  Maybe another choice, but it's really three or four companies all over North America, three or four in Europe, and they're all getting together and saying, we're not going to let you visit most websites.
[00:09:19.387 --> 00:09:21.248]  We're not going to let you download that much material.
[00:09:21.608 --> 00:09:22.808]  We're going to track what you do.
[00:09:23.189 --> 00:09:24.149]  Take Austin, Texas.
[00:09:24.169 --> 00:09:28.171]  When you type in a wrong website now, you don't get a computer error on your computer.
[00:09:28.611 --> 00:09:31.753]  You get a computer error on the Time Warner server.
[00:09:32.622 --> 00:09:36.944]  And they log everything you do, they track everything you do, the government's plugged right in, they watch it all.
[00:09:37.444 --> 00:09:42.906]  Your digital cable box watches everything you watch, creates a record of that for psychological makeup.
[00:09:44.307 --> 00:09:49.930]  And then they argue with you and say, we're not listening to any of your phone calls, and of course it turns out they're listening to everything.
[00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:51.810]  And it's criminal what they're doing.
[00:09:52.431 --> 00:09:53.311]  But they just don't care.
[00:09:53.611 --> 00:09:55.272]  Anything else, Brandon from New York?
[00:09:56.201 --> 00:10:10.655]  I would just like these elite scumbags to know that there's a coalition of elite hackers out there in this world that aren't sensitized, that are about the freedom of information and everything that's going on in this world.
[00:10:10.955 --> 00:10:13.358]  We know all about your site proxy program.
[00:10:13.857 --> 00:10:23.946]  We're just waiting to drop our viruses into your servers and destroy all that information right from the get-go so we can open the internet back up to where it should have been.
[00:10:24.366 --> 00:10:33.053]  Not paid for, free, by the people, for all the information and everybody to get, just like it was in the beginning.
[00:10:33.554 --> 00:10:39.299]  And now there's Silicon Valley insiders that are out there working for us and not against us.
[00:10:40.435 --> 00:10:40.995]  Well, that's right.
[00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:45.118]  As the tyranny gets worse and worse, as the people find out what's really happened.
[00:10:45.138 --> 00:10:47.620]  I mean, did you hear the poor guy in the first hour?
[00:10:48.101 --> 00:10:48.641]  And I believe him.
[00:10:48.661 --> 00:10:49.582]  He was going to send it all to me.
[00:10:49.602 --> 00:10:51.303]  He wanted to get a clerical job at the FBI.
[00:10:51.323 --> 00:10:52.604]  And they said, OK, we're going to hire you.
[00:10:53.064 --> 00:10:56.487]  And then they came and said, oh, sorry, we did more research on you.
[00:10:56.507 --> 00:10:58.408]  You visit Alex Jones's website.
[00:10:59.329 --> 00:11:01.070]  And the guy's like, well, how do you know this?
[00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:04.893]  Well, it's just amazing.
[00:11:05.093 --> 00:11:06.454]  I had, years ago,
[00:11:08.753 --> 00:11:28.465]  A lawyer involved exposing a bunch of corruption in Arkansas, dealing with Bill Clinton murders, from way back then, and then tied into Oklahoma City, and then when he was in a lawsuit with the Feds, there were his emails to me, like a decade ago, in the file, because it was all being grabbed.
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.001]  Explain to people, though, what they're setting up and what they're doing.
[00:11:34.201 --> 00:11:35.802]  See, that's why the web's slowing down.
[00:11:36.102 --> 00:11:42.784]  They're placing all their hubs, all their snoopers, in front of it, so you've got to go through their switchers.
[00:11:42.804 --> 00:11:43.684]  You want to explain that to them?
[00:11:44.385 --> 00:11:44.645]  Yeah.
[00:11:45.065 --> 00:11:56.909]  Basically what happened is, when Microsoft took over a corporation, okay, they started designing computers so that you had access to the internet through a phone line, okay?
[00:11:57.169 --> 00:11:58.790]  And that's how the internet started out.
[00:11:59.230 --> 00:11:59.610]  Well, as
[00:12:00.336 --> 00:12:02.959]  Everything came along and technology progressed.
[00:12:03.279 --> 00:12:12.790]  They started taking out these little things like your DOS running programs in your computer, or your hyperlink terminals in your computer, because phone lines were obsolete.
[00:12:13.368 --> 00:12:19.610]  And the reason that they were doing that was because they had no monitoring system through a phone line or a DSL.
[00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:27.893]  It was tracked just like back in the early 90s when people used to do things like phone freaking and call for free long distance.
[00:12:28.253 --> 00:12:37.957]  And when the government figured out that we could still get our information and it couldn't be monitored, they automatically switched everything over into an ISP protected network.
[00:12:38.812 --> 00:12:43.493]  And when that happened, they started raping you of your information from the get-go.
[00:12:43.893 --> 00:12:48.114]  And I would say that was probably somewhere in the midst of 97 until current.
[00:12:50.595 --> 00:12:54.256]  Absolutely, ladies and gentlemen, and they've got complete files on everybody.
[00:12:54.296 --> 00:12:55.756]  Now don't let that intimidate you.
[00:12:55.816 --> 00:12:56.636]  They're the crooks.
[00:12:56.716 --> 00:13:03.578]  They're the dirty, peeping toms, watching what you do, looking at what you do, in your bank accounts.
[00:13:04.938 --> 00:13:06.139]  They're the bad guys.
[00:13:06.299 --> 00:13:07.339]  They are the criminals.
[00:13:08.473 --> 00:13:09.434]  This is disgusting.
[00:13:10.475 --> 00:13:14.217]  You know, I would just like to let the American public know one thing.
[00:13:15.518 --> 00:13:26.186]  These people on the internet that get blasted as hackers that are, you know, you see them cracking IDF security database and other such things.
[00:13:26.966 --> 00:13:31.930]  The American people need to know that these people are fighting for you and your freedom.
[00:13:33.149 --> 00:13:35.089]  We're not the scumbag elite.
[00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:40.991]  We're trying to keep the information highways free so that you people can get this information.
[00:13:42.311 --> 00:13:49.993]  See, the general code of hacker elites usually work as, we won't do anything unless there's a probable cause for it.
[00:13:50.353 --> 00:13:54.194]  Well now the government's giving us a probable cause to defend ourselves.
[00:13:55.322 --> 00:13:59.945]  Well, we wouldn't have the internet today if it wasn't for the hackers defending it for the last 20 years.
[00:14:01.086 --> 00:14:16.097]  We know a lot of the bad hacking that we've seen has led right back to the Feds provocateur-ing it, or every time they want to restrict free speech or pass a hate law, we've caught them putting child porn out, putting Nazi stuff out, you know, going and hacking... Is there anything tied to the U.S.
[00:14:16.137 --> 00:14:22.502]  Department of Justice, Homeland Security, any sort of the military branches, Air Force, Navy, anything?
[00:14:24.013 --> 00:14:24.613]  That's right.
[00:14:24.934 --> 00:14:28.696]  And it's staged just as much as Barack Obama staged.
[00:14:29.236 --> 00:14:36.201]  You know, Alex, I would like to make a statement here and say, if there was a messiah in our world, I would have to say it's you.
[00:14:37.942 --> 00:14:45.867]  Everything that we need to know instead of the crap that's being filtered through TV that everybody eats up.
[00:14:46.267 --> 00:14:51.691]  It makes me absolutely disgusting to look at the TV and see the one
[00:14:53.047 --> 00:15:00.462]  No person that's an elected official in the country of the United States should be promoted as Jesus Christ.
[00:15:00.923 --> 00:15:02.827]  And that scares me.
[00:15:05.242 --> 00:15:06.043]  I hear you, my friend.
[00:15:06.083 --> 00:15:06.884]  Good to hear from you.
[00:15:07.204 --> 00:15:08.285]  Call back again, Brandon.
[00:15:08.605 --> 00:15:12.950]  I want to get to Scott, Arthur, Vicki, Aaron, because these calls are all so interesting.
[00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:13.991]  You want to hear the next one.
[00:15:14.351 --> 00:15:18.515]  And if you go too long, you don't get to hear the next one, but then you don't get to spend enough time with the last person.
[00:15:19.055 --> 00:15:24.040]  I think I had so many points I wanted to make, and then he said that thing about me, and it made me laugh, and I forgot them.
[00:15:28.244 --> 00:15:29.305]  The elites are ruthless.
[00:15:30.233 --> 00:15:35.996]  They're hurting us really, really bad right now, but they can't carry out their crimes and have a free internet.
[00:15:36.616 --> 00:15:39.338]  So that's why they're trying to shut it down right now, and they are.
[00:15:40.599 --> 00:15:50.664]  And that's why, folks, you should take the fact that you can see Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement online for free as something really valuable.
[00:15:52.425 --> 00:15:55.907]  You should take the fact that you can see Terror Storm or Loose Change Final Cut for free.
[00:15:58.157 --> 00:15:59.838]  They don't want that to happen for long.
[00:15:59.898 --> 00:16:02.701]  They've expunged it off of a lot of different servers and sites.
[00:16:04.823 --> 00:16:10.968]  And I'm so busy covering the news and things, I don't even really get into my films, but that's really a big part of the solution.
[00:16:11.348 --> 00:16:16.512]  And we may have to go back to, you know, hand-to-hand giving people videos and books and things.
[00:16:18.033 --> 00:16:22.217]  You know, as our only means, because the establishment is moving in to try to block our free speech.
[00:16:25.967 --> 00:16:39.914]  The point I wanted to make is, we've caught the government many times doing the hacks, doing the malicious things, you know, hacking hospitals and saying, oh, the hacker tried to turn off the power at the hospital so the old people would die.
[00:16:41.295 --> 00:16:44.416]  Folks, 99% of the time that's government.
[00:16:45.897 --> 00:16:48.878]  I mean, is there some mentally ill person out there that would try something like that?
[00:16:48.959 --> 00:16:49.699]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:16:50.459 --> 00:16:51.380]  Absolutely.
[00:16:52.902 --> 00:16:54.843]  But every time we track it back, it's the cops.
[00:16:55.184 --> 00:16:56.705]  I mean, I remember we're pulling into Denver.
[00:16:57.326 --> 00:17:01.770]  I'm talking to We Are Change and 9-11 Truth activists, and they said these guys were cops.
[00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:03.191]  They were pushing people.
[00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:03.932]  They were hitting people.
[00:17:03.972 --> 00:17:04.813]  They started a fight.
[00:17:06.174 --> 00:17:09.777]  And then we got there, and we witnessed people that were clearly cops stirring stuff up.
[00:17:10.318 --> 00:17:15.823]  And I went on air and said that witnesses saw Marines causing a riot one night.
[00:17:17.122 --> 00:17:20.883]  Dressed up like anarchists, but getting out of white vans marked, you know, U.S.
[00:17:20.903 --> 00:17:21.243]  government.
[00:17:21.943 --> 00:17:23.384]  It's now in the Denver Post!
[00:17:23.444 --> 00:17:24.984]  We've got to make this a big story!
[00:17:26.185 --> 00:17:30.706]  That they just admit!
[00:17:30.846 --> 00:17:37.868]  The cops go, yeah, we had officers out there dressed up like protesters and we had them attack police.
[00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:53.781]  I mean, let that sink in out there, folks.
[00:17:55.481 --> 00:17:57.382]  I'm not here bashing the police.
[00:17:57.542 --> 00:17:58.983]  I want the police on our side.
[00:17:59.883 --> 00:18:05.125]  I want them to say no to all this, but I happen to know the Feds bombed the World Trade Center the first time.
[00:18:05.145 --> 00:18:08.386]  I mean, that's even publicly admitted.
[00:18:08.426 --> 00:18:10.567]  They cooked the bomb, trained the drivers, gave them the detonators.
[00:18:11.347 --> 00:18:14.068]  I mean, they found two nuts to do it, but it was their idea.
[00:18:14.128 --> 00:18:14.888]  They created it.
[00:18:14.928 --> 00:18:15.889]  They got the informants.
[00:18:16.189 --> 00:18:18.830]  They went out and organized and led the attack.
[00:18:26.596 --> 00:18:28.657]  So, what am I supposed to do?
[00:18:28.717 --> 00:18:29.537]  Just ignore that?
[00:18:31.237 --> 00:18:32.718]  And the Feds bombed Oklahoma City.
[00:18:32.758 --> 00:18:34.458]  I mean, they just outright bombed it themselves.
[00:18:34.558 --> 00:18:35.318]  BATF did.
[00:18:37.939 --> 00:18:40.179]  And then the Feds did 9-11.
[00:18:40.259 --> 00:18:43.660]  And it's in the Army Field Manuals.
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:44.801]  It's in two of them.
[00:18:45.601 --> 00:18:46.961]  One of them just got declassified.
[00:18:46.981 --> 00:18:52.562]  And every time I mention this, people don't believe me and then go pull it up themselves.
[00:18:52.602 --> 00:18:54.263]  And it talks about false flag, torture.
[00:18:55.137 --> 00:18:56.238]  Staging terror attacks.
[00:18:56.358 --> 00:19:06.748]  I mean, the Army Field Manual for Captains and above tells them how to stage terror attacks.
[00:19:06.808 --> 00:19:08.609]  I mean, it's in the manual!
[00:19:13.093 --> 00:19:13.834]  I'm sick of it!
[00:19:14.855 --> 00:19:20.020]  I mean, do listeners think I'm having fun going up against these people?
[00:19:20.948 --> 00:19:21.949]  No, I'm not stupid.
[00:19:21.969 --> 00:19:26.915]  I mean, you think I like getting up here on air and that I enjoy standing up to these people?
[00:19:30.299 --> 00:19:31.641]  Believe me, folks, I'm a big fish.
[00:19:31.661 --> 00:19:33.162]  It's the only reason I'm not in prison or dead.
[00:19:33.922 --> 00:19:36.284]  And they may just say, you know, we don't care and kill me anyway.
[00:19:36.344 --> 00:19:37.845]  Because they don't care now, folks.
[00:19:37.865 --> 00:19:39.626]  They're taking all the money out of the banks.
[00:19:40.187 --> 00:19:41.368]  They're stealing everything.
[00:19:41.388 --> 00:19:42.969]  They're restricting free speech.
[00:19:43.629 --> 00:19:51.115]  They got local cops in Minnesota and Denver ready to follow federal orders to go out and attack other cops to blame it on the American people.
[00:19:52.596 --> 00:19:54.277]  I mean, the system is broken.
[00:19:56.559 --> 00:19:58.961]  And it comes out in the newspaper and nobody gets in trouble.
[00:19:59.981 --> 00:20:01.843]  I'm going to skip this break because I'm so far behind.
[00:20:01.863 --> 00:20:03.124]  I don't want to continue with your phone calls.
[00:20:04.801 --> 00:20:09.265]  So here we go, for folks on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:20:09.945 --> 00:20:11.527]  Scott in Oregon, you're on the air.
[00:20:11.607 --> 00:20:11.947]  Welcome.
[00:20:13.708 --> 00:20:14.569]  You're feeling better.
[00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:17.351]  Yeah, I've been hitting the cough button quite a bit.
[00:20:17.371 --> 00:20:18.973]  There's those long pauses, but thank you.
[00:20:20.034 --> 00:20:26.319]  Well, I'm calling from Central Oregon, and I'm calling to give a report, plus two questions for you.
[00:20:27.043 --> 00:20:32.145]  One report is I've been making contact with my emergency management crew here in Mill, Oregon.
[00:20:32.425 --> 00:20:34.706]  I've been contacting the state and local police.
[00:20:35.346 --> 00:20:40.468]  I have two National Guard stations here in my Central Oregon area.
[00:20:40.969 --> 00:20:54.794]  I went to the administration of the National Guard here, and I asked the CO there, do you know anything about the upcoming martial law, Rex 84, Operation Garden Plot, and Cable Splicer?
[00:20:55.868 --> 00:21:01.892]  Can you believe all these agencies, they all acted stupid, like I was crazy, okay?
[00:21:02.712 --> 00:21:21.583]  Then, I go down to the training facility here for a National Guard, and I walked right into the barracks, and I walked right up to the CO's desk, and I talked to him for a minute, and he acted stupid, and I told him I was proud to be a Red Lister, and he jokingly,
[00:21:22.418 --> 00:21:26.040]  Laughed and said, if you're a red lister, I will shoot you.
[00:21:28.882 --> 00:21:30.743]  Oh no, it's all about their personal power.
[00:21:30.783 --> 00:21:34.104]  See, they're looking forward to it like it's deer hunting.
[00:21:34.765 --> 00:21:40.428]  They want to ride around with miniguns in the backs of trucks laughing like they did in Iraq, just shooting us off the road.
[00:21:40.808 --> 00:21:43.129]  And there'll be lots of families out with flags waving it.
[00:21:43.389 --> 00:21:45.891]  They're fighting the domestic wide Al Qaeda!
[00:21:46.311 --> 00:21:46.851]  Get them!
[00:21:47.271 --> 00:21:49.232]  Let the bankers have all our money!
[00:21:50.544 --> 00:21:56.867]  And he tried to deny it and tried to act stupid, and then at the end of it, I said, I'm going to be a Red Lister.
[00:21:56.887 --> 00:22:01.849]  And he goes, well, laughingly, trying to make a joke of it, if you're a Red Lister, I'll have to shoot you.
[00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:03.210]  You know?
[00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:08.032]  So, anyway, and after I made... And you hadn't mentioned anything about Red Lister to him?
[00:22:08.972 --> 00:22:09.393]  Excuse me?
[00:22:09.593 --> 00:22:11.353]  You hadn't mentioned anything about Red Lister to him?
[00:22:12.214 --> 00:22:16.876]  Well, after he played stupid and I told him to Google, right there, I said, turn on your computer.
[00:22:17.876 --> 00:22:21.959]  I said, clear off the screen and type in red list, blue list.
[00:22:22.579 --> 00:22:27.342]  And he looked at it for about two seconds and turned around and said, well if you're a red lister I'm going to have to shoot you.
[00:22:28.603 --> 00:22:29.443]  And then he laughed.
[00:22:29.943 --> 00:22:32.085]  Of course I didn't take that too kindly, you know.
[00:22:33.666 --> 00:22:34.866]  This was two weeks ago.
[00:22:35.467 --> 00:22:46.433]  Now, after I've made my visits and my contacts with the emergency management, the National Guard, the state and local police, I immediately start getting phone calls.
[00:22:47.318 --> 00:22:52.762]  From survey groups, the Gallup polls, people trying to take polls and ask me questions.
[00:22:53.202 --> 00:22:58.425]  And their questions were so sensitive that it was just, it was insane.
[00:22:59.266 --> 00:23:00.967]  Pretty much, how many people live in your house?
[00:23:01.487 --> 00:23:02.368]  How strong are you?
[00:23:02.408 --> 00:23:04.389]  Can you do physical this or that?
[00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:06.450]  Or, you know, how much do you weigh?
[00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:07.531]  How tall are you?
[00:23:08.652 --> 00:23:16.797]  And to me, and I'm asking you this, a question, I believe and I feel with all my heart that this is all going into a database on people getting
[00:23:17.426 --> 00:23:17.826]  Yes.
[00:23:17.987 --> 00:23:18.167]  Yes.
[00:23:39.785 --> 00:23:40.465]  Yeah.
[00:23:40.605 --> 00:23:48.468]  So it's all going in databases because the bankers that own our government, their business is controlling slaves.
[00:23:49.068 --> 00:23:52.589]  Their business is managing us, the slaves.
[00:23:53.689 --> 00:23:56.890]  It is not making or manufacturing anything.
[00:23:57.391 --> 00:24:01.312]  And so everything they do is about how to control us, how to dumb us down, how to divide us.
[00:24:01.692 --> 00:24:02.932]  Scott, I appreciate your call.
[00:24:04.653 --> 00:24:04.993]  Here we go.
[00:24:13.111 --> 00:24:20.653]  Alright, I want to hurry through your calls because I want to get into a bunch of news in the Barack Obama worship that I've been witnessing.
[00:24:20.673 --> 00:24:28.095]  Let's go ahead and talk to Arthur in New Jersey.
[00:24:28.195 --> 00:24:29.096]  Arthur, you're on the air.
[00:24:29.976 --> 00:24:30.356]  Yeah, hi.
[00:24:30.376 --> 00:24:36.598]  I just want to... I do see a New World Order, but I do not see a Western-controlled New World Order.
[00:24:37.278 --> 00:24:40.179]  If China and Japan dump their treasuries tomorrow,
[00:24:40.657 --> 00:24:42.779]  The dollar would be completely worthless and the U.S.
[00:24:42.799 --> 00:24:44.320]  would essentially go into bankruptcy.
[00:24:45.201 --> 00:24:49.986]  What I do see in the future is that you're going to have the U.S.
[00:24:50.346 --> 00:24:56.512]  go bankrupt and you're going to have these foreign countries that have holdings in U.S.
[00:24:56.552 --> 00:24:58.754]  Treasuries essentially going to be a bankruptcy liquidation.
[00:24:58.774 --> 00:24:59.955]  You're going to see U.S.
[00:24:59.995 --> 00:25:02.377]  corporations being sold out to these foreign countries.
[00:25:05.367 --> 00:25:09.029]  Well, that's exactly what the New World Order is.
[00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:13.412]  Except, hang on, it's not the New World Order, per se.
[00:25:14.813 --> 00:25:33.304]  Oswald Spengler wrote in The Decline of the West, a great book, that civilization is going in cycles, and that Western civilization is currently in its winter, which means it's currently on its deathbed, essentially, and that it will not be able to survive.
[00:25:33.384 --> 00:25:35.125]  It's lost its culture, it's lost its
[00:25:36.067 --> 00:25:47.696]  Ideal, essentially it's a form of second religiousness which lost its original faith, the Western interpretation of Christianity, and essentially it's morally bankrupt.
[00:25:49.297 --> 00:25:55.402]  Spengler compared the Western men, he compared it to the Faustian men from Goethe's Faust.
[00:25:55.482 --> 00:26:04.049]  Essentially what they're doing is they're selling out their soul for a few quick bucks, when in reality what's going to happen is that ramifications are just
[00:26:05.037 --> 00:26:05.257]  Yes.
[00:26:26.064 --> 00:26:27.245]  No, there's no turning back.
[00:26:27.926 --> 00:26:29.187]  Let me just stop you right there.
[00:26:30.388 --> 00:26:34.671]  You know, it's easy to sit here and say this is all just a cycle and there's not really a new world order.
[00:26:35.652 --> 00:26:37.673]  I'm going off all the governmental documents.
[00:26:38.114 --> 00:26:40.756]  They said they were going to engineer this economic collapse.
[00:26:41.216 --> 00:26:46.420]  They said they were going to morally bankrupt us so we wouldn't stick together to make us more easily manageable slaves.
[00:26:46.921 --> 00:26:48.722]  This is being done by design.
[00:26:49.262 --> 00:26:51.564]  Here's Gordon Brown, the London Telegraph today.
[00:26:51.584 --> 00:26:53.065]  I'll put this up on the document cam, please.
[00:26:54.006 --> 00:26:55.387]  There's Gordon Brown right there.
[00:26:55.447 --> 00:26:59.331]  Gordon Brown calls for a new world order to beat recession.
[00:26:59.671 --> 00:27:09.239]  Again, the bankers engineer the crisis, and then they offer the solution, which is world government, run for and by the bankers.
[00:27:09.999 --> 00:27:11.701]  And so that's what they're setting up.
[00:27:11.741 --> 00:27:17.826]  It isn't like, it's my opinion, a long time beforehand we laid out what's going on.
[00:27:18.646 --> 00:27:20.148]  So I appreciate your call, Arthur.
[00:27:20.548 --> 00:27:22.650]  Vicki in Ohio, you're on the air, welcome.
[00:27:24.039 --> 00:27:25.140]  Oh, hello?
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:25.620]  Yes!
[00:27:26.441 --> 00:27:28.423]  Okay, I heard a big beep, I didn't know if I got cut off.
[00:27:29.043 --> 00:27:41.773]  Um, um, just to, like, make you feel better about it, um, years ago, after 9-11, I started doing some research on the computer about why Islam and Christianity would want to kill each other, both monolithic, that I ran into the conspiracy theorists.
[00:27:42.654 --> 00:27:44.315]  North American, I wrote you off as nuts.
[00:27:45.577 --> 00:27:49.159]  And then I started looking at what's going on in the news, I'm like, um, it's all coming true!
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.021]  Now you got my attention.
[00:27:52.126 --> 00:27:54.007]  Um, and I gave up on the political system years ago.
[00:27:54.027 --> 00:27:55.247]  I just never put the pieces together.
[00:27:55.267 --> 00:27:57.108]  I figured, I don't give a crap what you put in that office.
[00:27:57.128 --> 00:27:57.988]  They do anything anyway.
[00:27:59.048 --> 00:28:00.429]  But I do have a few questions to make short.
[00:28:00.769 --> 00:28:04.230]  And number one, I am an Evangelical Christian that knows the Word of God is the Bible.
[00:28:05.071 --> 00:28:19.275]  And, not to criticize you, I'm trying to get some of the heat off you, there is a verse in Epaphians, you know, don't go along like a little sheep, it says in the Bible, Christians, if you don't believe me, check it out, it says, God's command, take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them.
[00:28:19.636 --> 00:28:20.756]  You are right, they are wrong.
[00:28:21.926 --> 00:28:22.866]  This is corrupt as hell.
[00:28:23.627 --> 00:28:25.728]  Number one, you are doing the right thing.
[00:28:25.748 --> 00:28:30.810]  Yeah, I forget that, uh, what exact verse is that in Ephesians?
[00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:32.051]  It's in Ephesians.
[00:28:32.111 --> 00:28:34.592]  I'm sorry, I'm so upset right now, because my head's about to explode.
[00:28:34.612 --> 00:28:34.592]  511.
[00:28:34.772 --> 00:28:39.154]  It says, God's command, take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness.
[00:28:39.554 --> 00:28:40.395]  Instead, expose them.
[00:28:40.955 --> 00:28:42.015]  God's law is love.
[00:28:43.656 --> 00:28:44.697]  Absolutely.
[00:28:45.037 --> 00:28:47.498]  And if you love people, you're going to... Love protects the weaker.
[00:28:47.578 --> 00:28:49.539]  I don't give a damn who's doing it, your government or what.
[00:28:50.219 --> 00:28:51.700]  Love protects the weaker.
[00:28:53.243 --> 00:28:59.086]  Number two, um, they think they're going to get raptured out of here when the Antichrist comes?
[00:28:59.706 --> 00:29:00.907]  Wrong story, bad theology.
[00:29:01.527 --> 00:29:04.869]  The Bible, and I just want to get some heat off your back, you're going to be here.
[00:29:05.209 --> 00:29:12.233]  The Bible, God protects, God promises protection for His people from the plagues He will enforce.
[00:29:12.773 --> 00:29:14.974]  If you're not here, you don't need that protection.
[00:29:15.354 --> 00:29:18.216]  Baby, I hate to tell you people this, I don't want you with your pants down.
[00:29:18.636 --> 00:29:20.677]  If it comes down, your butts are going to be here.
[00:29:20.697 --> 00:29:22.178]  You might as well wake up and smell the coffee.
[00:29:23.294 --> 00:29:25.615]  God does not need to promise protection for people who are raptured out of here.
[00:29:25.655 --> 00:29:28.096]  Yes, there is a rapture, probably just before Christ comes.
[00:29:28.356 --> 00:29:29.277]  Bad theology again.
[00:29:30.377 --> 00:29:32.538]  And number two, that unilateral support for Israel.
[00:29:32.798 --> 00:29:37.160]  I hate to tell you evangelicals this, God gave Israel no mandate to go kill innocent Arabs.
[00:29:38.361 --> 00:29:40.181]  He says a nation will be born in a day.
[00:29:40.281 --> 00:29:41.322]  He meant spiritually born.
[00:29:41.562 --> 00:29:42.983]  Israel, we're going to repent of Christ's coming.
[00:29:43.583 --> 00:29:44.123]  You are wrong.
[00:29:44.223 --> 00:29:47.265]  God does not approve of slaughtering and murdering innocent Arabs.
[00:29:47.505 --> 00:29:48.105]  He loved them too.
[00:29:49.116 --> 00:29:50.757]  So, you might as well wake up and smell the coffee.
[00:29:51.157 --> 00:29:52.699]  You guys are wrong, this guy is right.
[00:29:52.799 --> 00:29:56.321]  Hold on, I'm going to let you finish up on the PrisonPlanet.tv end of it.
[00:29:56.521 --> 00:29:58.102]  We're going to come back and talk to BL and others.
[00:29:58.122 --> 00:29:59.263]  Stay with me.
[00:30:00.204 --> 00:30:02.545]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.645 --> 00:30:05.107]  It's the Alex Jones Show on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:06.268 --> 00:30:13.113]  Again, coming up, I'm going to go through just a few of the editorial cartoons I saw worshipping Obama and some other news articles and calls, but I wanted to let
[00:30:14.648 --> 00:30:19.032]  Get a chance to let you finish up what you were saying, Vickie from Ohio, go ahead.
[00:30:21.594 --> 00:30:21.854]  Hello?
[00:30:22.094 --> 00:30:24.156]  Yes, Vickie, you're still on the air, we're just on the internet.
[00:30:24.176 --> 00:30:27.599]  Oh, I'm sorry, okay, I had a couple of questions I'm trying to ask, but not wise your time.
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:33.364]  Oh no, it's not my time, it's just we've got to... Go ahead and finish up your points.
[00:30:34.044 --> 00:30:37.808]  The food situation, I've been trying to do some independent checking.
[00:30:38.048 --> 00:30:41.350]  Are the grocery stores and the farmers getting credit so we'll at least have food in a couple months?
[00:30:41.411 --> 00:30:41.771]  Yes or no?
[00:30:43.208 --> 00:30:47.131]  There is all sorts of speculation that's driven up the price of food.
[00:30:47.191 --> 00:30:52.635]  There has been food riots in more than 50 countries with shortages.
[00:30:53.296 --> 00:30:56.679]  I don't know if that's going to happen here in the United States.
[00:30:56.779 --> 00:31:03.864]  I know a lot of people who I trust think that that is going on, but I just don't know.
[00:31:03.884 --> 00:31:07.467]  I mean, we've got so many supplies of food, so many ways to get food.
[00:31:07.487 --> 00:31:10.910]  Okay, so I don't have to start really interrupting myself.
[00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:12.331]  Well, what I think is clear
[00:31:12.995 --> 00:31:16.337]  That's one thing you said, I can't independently verify, and you never claimed it was true.
[00:31:16.377 --> 00:31:20.780]  Yeah, well, I mean, to be specific, food prices have already gone up a lot.
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:28.765]  And so, I've been saying for the last year, buy food in case we go into a full-bore depression, because people starved to death during the last one.
[00:31:29.445 --> 00:31:34.128]  Okay, so, all I'm saying is, it's good in uncertain times to have storable food.
[00:31:34.889 --> 00:31:38.431]  Right, yeah, but it's just, I mean, in my position, the stores are going to be bankrupt.
[00:31:40.225 --> 00:31:40.765]  Okay, number two.
[00:31:40.805 --> 00:31:42.806]  I live relatively close to the Canadian border.
[00:31:43.247 --> 00:31:45.968]  I keep trying to explain this to people, and they've dumbed down America so much.
[00:31:45.988 --> 00:31:50.791]  They don't understand economic theory, finance, and how the banking system works, so they don't understand the dollar's close to collapse.
[00:31:52.092 --> 00:31:57.094]  And they look at me like I'm nuts, but I have more education, and my IQ's a little bit higher, so I understand.
[00:31:57.135 --> 00:31:59.356]  I try to put some material together to explain it to them.
[00:31:59.776 --> 00:32:02.137]  I live in a very short drive to the Canadian border.
[00:32:02.658 --> 00:32:03.538]  I don't have a lot of money.
[00:32:03.598 --> 00:32:06.780]  Would Canadian currency be worth anything if the dollar collapses?
[00:32:07.748 --> 00:32:30.738]  You know, there's so many different things the New World Order can do, but they told us in the Trilateral Commission documents, in the IMF and World Bank documents, they told us over and over again, excuse me, getting out that cold, they told us over and over again that they were going to do specific things in specific order.
[00:32:34.379 --> 00:32:36.320]  If the dollar collapsed, that would probably not
[00:32:37.329 --> 00:32:41.991]  Portend well for the loony, but I just don't know and I've got to jump.
[00:32:42.051 --> 00:32:43.872]  I appreciate your call, Vicky.
[00:32:45.453 --> 00:33:00.601]  We're going to come back and take your phone calls here as we go live to the full broadcast.
[00:33:01.181 --> 00:33:01.802]  So here we go.
[00:33:03.655 --> 00:33:05.476]  Visit survivalproperty.com.
[00:33:05.796 --> 00:33:07.657]  That's survivalproperty.com.
[00:33:09.018 --> 00:33:12.819]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[00:33:16.701 --> 00:33:20.223]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:40.331]  Okay, we're back live.
[00:33:40.371 --> 00:33:44.653]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:33:45.854 --> 00:33:52.258]  I want to go over the Barack Obama coverage that we've been witnessing.
[00:33:55.460 --> 00:34:03.725]  First off, people keep saying everything has changed, everything is different.
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:12.287]  That we are all saved now because Barack Obama is here.
[00:34:13.488 --> 00:34:26.501]  They're saying that we can basically all go back to sleep now because he's been elected.
[00:34:29.244 --> 00:34:43.389]  And I just see this over and over and over and over again, and people are going to find out things are not different, other than we've got a new president who's a complete puppet of the very same financial interest.
[00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:50.391]  Who he's appointing in his cabinet, his chief of staff, his policies.
[00:34:50.451 --> 00:34:53.212]  He was the guy that supported the
[00:34:55.498 --> 00:34:59.802]  Banker empowerment, banker takeover bill, not one red cent given to the economy.
[00:34:59.942 --> 00:35:07.148]  All of it, the banks bragged for bonuses and to buy up other financial institutions and elements of the real economy, which they're now doing.
[00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:15.295]  But I was at my parents' house last night, eating dinner, and back on the back porch they have a cockatoo.
[00:35:15.795 --> 00:35:20.960]  And back there, that's where they put their magazines and newspapers for recycling, and some of it's used for birdcage liners.
[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:21.861]  So I've made the point that
[00:35:23.377 --> 00:35:27.500]  Literally, this is only good for birdcage liner, and that's what it was intended for.
[00:35:29.341 --> 00:35:33.444]  But take this Newsweek here, and I only dug around for about three minutes.
[00:35:33.504 --> 00:35:41.488]  Then I went to work last night, to the radio station, and there were magazines and newspapers laying around, and I saw the same thing.
[00:35:41.528 --> 00:35:45.311]  And so I know you're seeing it out there yourself.
[00:35:47.432 --> 00:35:51.895]  President Barack Obama, this is out of Newsweek magazine.
[00:35:53.089 --> 00:35:57.471]  Right here, and I'm going to show this to people on PrisonPlanet.tv on the document cam.
[00:36:00.092 --> 00:36:13.256]  And in here they show him as the savior of the Bill of Rights, the savior of the Constitution, the Constitution, we the people, and he's sitting at the Oval Office.
[00:36:13.756 --> 00:36:15.077]  I'll put that on screen for people.
[00:36:17.478 --> 00:36:20.339]  He is sitting in the Oval Office
[00:36:21.676 --> 00:36:35.246]  Lovingly trying to fix it, he's got his little roll of tape there and he's putting the last piece of the Bill of Rights that's been torn in pieces back together again.
[00:36:37.327 --> 00:36:43.632]  So he's the good guy and right next to it is the evil Dick Cheney and George Bush.
[00:36:44.492 --> 00:36:46.494]  They're playing their part, you know, they're being bad.
[00:36:46.514 --> 00:36:48.255]  It says, Golly Dick,
[00:36:50.071 --> 00:36:56.732]  As our time in office comes to a close, I reflect on all we both have accomplished.
[00:36:59.413 --> 00:37:01.233]  And then Cheney says we didn't get impeached.
[00:37:02.253 --> 00:37:03.633]  But that's an interesting point.
[00:37:04.033 --> 00:37:07.474]  If we've got so much change, then crime should be punished.
[00:37:07.494 --> 00:37:10.295]  You know, Bill Clinton was protected by George Bush Sr.
[00:37:14.035 --> 00:37:18.096]  George Bush Jr., whenever he got into office,
[00:37:19.778 --> 00:37:29.240]  Blocked Congressman Dan Burton's committee from going after him for pardon gait of convicted cocaine dealers and others and Chinese generals paying people off in the Commerce Department.
[00:37:30.461 --> 00:37:31.421]  But here is this image.
[00:37:31.461 --> 00:37:43.844]  Barack Obama lovingly is putting the Constitution back together again.
[00:37:44.704 --> 00:37:53.109]  Barack Obama is saying he's going to have youth brigades, a million-man spy force, that they're going to spy more on the American people.
[00:37:53.169 --> 00:37:57.953]  He voted for warrantless wiretapping and to not have a Fourth or Fifth Amendment in the U.S., basically.
[00:37:59.093 --> 00:38:00.954]  He is saying that we're going to have more wars.
[00:38:03.436 --> 00:38:04.517]  The list goes on and on.
[00:38:06.758 --> 00:38:08.599]  He's for the phony drug war.
[00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:11.481]  You don't hear him saying reform drug laws.
[00:38:11.681 --> 00:38:12.122]  Nothing!
[00:38:13.066 --> 00:38:16.067]  He's appointing a who's who of Wall Street that have already looted us.
[00:38:16.107 --> 00:38:17.288]  He's promising more looting.
[00:38:17.628 --> 00:38:18.308]  But they don't care.
[00:38:18.568 --> 00:38:26.691]  The simple-minded public can get Newsweek and can pull it open and go, oh gee, he's putting the Constitution back together.
[00:38:27.892 --> 00:38:32.013]  Now actually, in by their dinner table I read this first and thought, what propaganda?
[00:38:32.574 --> 00:38:38.196]  So then I'm walking by the newspaper and I see a whole page
[00:38:39.412 --> 00:38:42.253]  of these in the Sundays Insight area.
[00:38:42.873 --> 00:38:45.534]  A whole page of how, you know, the same thing.
[00:38:45.574 --> 00:38:46.675]  He's fixing the Constitution.
[00:38:46.695 --> 00:38:47.755]  He's fixing the Bill of Rights.
[00:38:47.795 --> 00:38:49.056]  He's fixing America.
[00:38:49.276 --> 00:38:55.158]  Folks, if you have these, scan these in and email them to Aaron at InfoWars.com because I want to come on the show tomorrow.
[00:38:55.418 --> 00:39:02.621]  I'm tempted to go to like Barnes and Nobles or something to a newsstand and just buy like 20 magazines and just show this unified propaganda.
[00:39:03.902 --> 00:39:04.682]  But here is the
[00:39:08.925 --> 00:39:10.366]  Here's the Austin American Statesman.
[00:39:11.126 --> 00:39:14.488]  It's got people crying and worshipping him and everything's saved.
[00:39:14.528 --> 00:39:16.409]  And they have this editorial cartoon.
[00:39:16.829 --> 00:39:17.710]  White House Attic.
[00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:19.051]  Hey, cool old stuff.
[00:39:19.471 --> 00:39:20.551]  And what's the cool old stuff?
[00:39:20.591 --> 00:39:22.473]  Government of the people, by the people, for the people.
[00:39:24.334 --> 00:39:25.994]  And he's lovingly looking at it.
[00:39:26.054 --> 00:39:27.415]  He loves freedom.
[00:39:27.855 --> 00:39:29.196]  He loves America.
[00:39:29.857 --> 00:39:31.217]  He's going to fix all that.
[00:39:32.798 --> 00:39:34.139]  He's not saying a word about it.
[00:39:34.179 --> 00:39:37.601]  He's moving ahead with all these police state measures.
[00:39:39.266 --> 00:39:47.351]  He's supporting everything, but... There's the shot for you, watching on the internet.
[00:39:49.172 --> 00:39:49.932]  Ben Sargent.
[00:39:52.193 --> 00:40:00.798]  I put a Ben Sargent cartoon in my book, 9-11 Assent to Tyranny, where it's Ashcroft arresting Uncle Sam, and he has a Bill of Rights, and he says, Oh!
[00:40:01.318 --> 00:40:04.020]  Carrying one of those terrorist manuals, are you?
[00:40:05.728 --> 00:40:16.293]  See, that was inaccurate, because in reality, Ben Sargent lives in town, and I was told by one of his friends, oh yeah, he got that idea from your show, because I was joking around about terrorist manuals with a pocket constitution.
[00:40:16.614 --> 00:40:23.917]  That's actually in my film, Road to Tyranny, where they were listing people that have pocket constitutions as terrorists.
[00:40:24.398 --> 00:40:26.599]  So Ben Sargent, local cartoonist, he did that.
[00:40:26.619 --> 00:40:32.502]  Well, see, now Ben Sargent does one that's deceptive.
[00:40:34.076 --> 00:40:36.637]  Hey, cool old stuff in the White House attic!
[00:40:38.078 --> 00:40:40.118]  Government of the people, by the people, for the people.
[00:40:41.259 --> 00:40:41.439]  Why?
[00:40:41.459 --> 00:40:44.420]  Because the people can be suckered and he can give a better speech?
[00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:46.341]  And he can con the public?
[00:40:50.410 --> 00:40:56.373]  And then it just goes on and on with similar editorials and so email them to erininfowars.com.
[00:40:56.413 --> 00:40:58.334]  The next few days we'll show you a whole bunch more of them.
[00:40:58.774 --> 00:41:00.555]  And then there's just lots of coverage like this.
[00:41:01.275 --> 00:41:04.837]  Fun, fun, fun, post-election, cuddling begins on page 24.
[00:41:09.939 --> 00:41:19.084]  And they've got similar things in here and articles with people crying
[00:41:19.943 --> 00:41:33.231]  You know, it's just everything is solved, everything is fine, and you can find these clips all over YouTube from mainstream television with people saying, I don't have to worry about my bills again, I don't have to worry about health care again, I'm saved, my future is great.
[00:41:33.592 --> 00:41:44.759]  And optimism is great if it's based on some type of real reform that quantitatively, historically will actually help the people.
[00:41:45.515 --> 00:41:58.285]  But it's not when it's based on fraud, and you know the agenda is continuing, run by the same corporate elites, openly setting up a new world order, and they have no intention of changing it.
[00:41:59.446 --> 00:42:03.690]  They're just continuing, but because the person has different rhetoric, everything's okay.
[00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:04.911]  Here's another one.
[00:42:06.772 --> 00:42:08.234]  Austin American Statesman, Monday.
[00:42:08.974 --> 00:42:12.297]  Now understand, this is three minutes, digging around in some newspapers.
[00:42:16.308 --> 00:42:18.029]  Because I thought, man, it's in this magazine.
[00:42:18.069 --> 00:42:19.150]  Wait, it's in that magazine.
[00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:20.571]  Everything I was opening had it.
[00:42:21.232 --> 00:42:22.693]  National, local, didn't matter.
[00:42:23.133 --> 00:42:25.375]  I opened up a Time magazine.
[00:42:25.435 --> 00:42:26.756]  My mom said, don't take that with you.
[00:42:26.776 --> 00:42:27.397]  I haven't read it yet.
[00:42:28.257 --> 00:42:30.779]  And it had them in there, with him fixing the Bill of Rights.
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:32.060]  Here it is.
[00:42:32.661 --> 00:42:34.022]  Passing the Torch.
[00:42:34.042 --> 00:42:39.986]  This is the sign Wilkinson, Philadelphia Daily News.
[00:42:40.407 --> 00:42:41.267]  Passing the Torch.
[00:42:41.387 --> 00:42:43.269]  And it's the Torch of Liberty.
[00:42:45.204 --> 00:43:06.623]  uh... it's uh... just gone out and obama is reaching for it and it says jumbo matches in his hand there you go for prison planet dot tv viewers actually have some more here but jumbo matches and and and
[00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:09.911]  Just every magazine, every newspaper, the same thing.
[00:43:10.271 --> 00:43:11.612]  He's going to reignite liberty.
[00:43:11.972 --> 00:43:13.912]  He's going to fix the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:43:14.253 --> 00:43:29.439]  But he's saying nothing about it, and everything he's doing is promising more attacks on individual liberty, the Second Amendment, right to defend yourself, victim disarmament, warrantless wiretapping, more wars, domestic spy forces as strong as the U.S.
[00:43:29.479 --> 00:43:29.919]  military.
[00:43:31.158 --> 00:43:38.000]  In fact, when he first said this about six, seven months ago in the Chicago Tribune reported on it, people didn't believe it and they denied it.
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:47.442]  John, pull that audio clip up about a domestic spy force as strong as the military.
[00:43:50.442 --> 00:43:51.482]  Jumbo matches.
[00:43:51.522 --> 00:43:52.103]  Put it back up there.
[00:43:53.183 --> 00:43:54.403]  He's going to fix it.
[00:43:55.683 --> 00:43:56.724]  Everything is solved.
[00:43:57.324 --> 00:43:58.184]  Everything is fine.
[00:44:00.054 --> 00:44:02.255]  Again, I'm going to go ahead and stop going through these.
[00:44:02.536 --> 00:44:03.556]  There are even more.
[00:44:06.338 --> 00:44:08.499]  And I am going to make a documentary on Barack Obama.
[00:44:08.539 --> 00:44:09.180]  I've decided it.
[00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:14.263]  In fact, I'm just going to say now, I'm still going up to Dallas for the anniversary of JFK.
[00:44:14.303 --> 00:44:20.727]  I'm making that film with a bunch of people in it, but that is going to be going on the shelf.
[00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:25.071]  So is my film on the overall eugenics plan.
[00:44:25.091 --> 00:44:26.172]  That's going to be the masterpiece.
[00:44:26.972 --> 00:44:31.895]  I'm just going to put out a quick film on Obama because we need something to go viral and go viral now.
[00:44:32.295 --> 00:44:34.796]  So send me all your videos of Obama, all your research.
[00:44:34.836 --> 00:44:35.516]  We want it all.
[00:44:36.337 --> 00:44:41.339]  Send it to 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[00:44:47.622 --> 00:44:49.503]  And then there's all these type of headlines.
[00:44:49.523 --> 00:44:50.964]  I just knocked my stack off here.
[00:44:55.069 --> 00:44:56.850]  About Obama to change world.
[00:44:56.930 --> 00:44:58.510]  Obama to save world.
[00:45:00.511 --> 00:45:03.152]  On and on and on and on and on.
[00:45:05.913 --> 00:45:07.413]  Now, I want to go to your phone calls.
[00:45:07.433 --> 00:45:18.577]  I want to go to your phone calls, but there's a bunch of other news I haven't gotten to yet, so let me hurriedly go over this.
[00:45:22.619 --> 00:45:39.052]  To participate in Exercise VIGILANT SHIELD 09, and they're going to do a coordinated practice takeover of the local constabulary in multiple states for three simultaneous nukes going off in the United States, November 12th through the 18th.
[00:45:39.513 --> 00:45:47.960]  Always got to look at those because they use that as a pretext to carry out real attacks as an overall cover.
[00:45:50.492 --> 00:45:52.972]  On the Barack Obama issue, this is the one I was looking for.
[00:45:53.272 --> 00:45:55.413]  Barack Obama vows to change the world.
[00:45:55.453 --> 00:45:58.393]  Look, he's the one.
[00:45:59.854 --> 00:46:01.314]  He's going to change it all.
[00:46:04.494 --> 00:46:06.075]  They're saying Bin Laden is going to attack.
[00:46:06.155 --> 00:46:07.035]  It's not to test him.
[00:46:07.095 --> 00:46:14.076]  The CIA may stage another terror attack, or Israel, or somebody else, to then embolden him and say, we've got to get behind him.
[00:46:14.136 --> 00:46:15.456]  Now he's got to have another war.
[00:46:15.796 --> 00:46:19.697]  He didn't want to, but he has to, because the terrorists hit us again.
[00:46:24.215 --> 00:46:26.597]  But let me get into this one.
[00:46:29.159 --> 00:46:40.489]  Mainstream News is reporting that George Washington Blogspot has done a boil down of this about we must push for a prosecution of Bush and Cheney.
[00:46:41.109 --> 00:46:42.350]  That is certainly important.
[00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:43.031]  We need to do that.
[00:46:44.932 --> 00:46:52.599]  I have a couple other stories here, but I've got so many I need to be careful about how many I cover because I won't have time to cover them all.
[00:46:56.411 --> 00:47:11.503]  There was another one here out of AFP where the New York Times is reporting that
[00:47:13.459 --> 00:47:13.999]  The U.S.
[00:47:14.079 --> 00:47:17.762]  ran secret terror attacks inside Iran trying to topple the government.
[00:47:18.522 --> 00:47:21.904]  I've been telling you that for five years, and the White House submitted it over a year ago.
[00:47:22.525 --> 00:47:24.066]  Now the New York Times is breaking it.
[00:47:24.086 --> 00:47:26.287]  They'll probably get a Pulitzer Prize or something.
[00:47:27.508 --> 00:47:30.690]  Before we do that, before we go back to your phone calls,
[00:47:42.315 --> 00:47:44.677]  This is what happens when I go on the air when I've got a cold, folks.
[00:47:44.717 --> 00:47:45.958]  I'm kind of out of it a little bit today.
[00:47:46.798 --> 00:47:47.879]  Before I go to B.E.L.
[00:47:47.919 --> 00:47:56.085]  and Texas and others that are holding, there's a couple sponsors I want to tell you about that make this broadcast possible.
[00:47:57.206 --> 00:48:03.030]  One of them is Cola Blue, the great atmospheric water generator that I use here in my office.
[00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:05.371]  I just ordered another one for my home.
[00:48:06.317 --> 00:48:07.917]  Same thing Willie Nelson basically pushes.
[00:48:08.738 --> 00:48:10.578]  It's got five filters in it.
[00:48:10.658 --> 00:48:12.919]  It grabs the water out of the air and then runs through the five filters.
[00:48:13.279 --> 00:48:15.639]  Find out more at ECOLOBLUE.COM.
[00:48:16.119 --> 00:48:17.240]  You really want to check this out.
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:18.280]  ECOLOBLUE.COM or 1-866-585-4044.
[00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:20.340]  There's big banners at the top of Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:48:26.502 --> 00:48:27.983]  And I really think you should check it out.
[00:48:28.023 --> 00:48:28.884]  Again, acolablue.com or 866-585-4044.
[00:48:28.904 --> 00:48:29.825]  1-866-585-4044. acolablue.com.
[00:48:29.885 --> 00:48:31.927]  Atmospheric Water Generator for your home.
[00:48:31.967 --> 00:48:33.168]  You really can't beat it!
[00:48:43.590 --> 00:48:46.753]  Another one of our fine sponsors is New Vitality.
[00:48:47.154 --> 00:48:48.935]  Their website is www.newvitality.com.
[00:48:48.975 --> 00:48:53.900]  I have a banner up on www.infowars.com and www.prisonplanet.com for those folks.
[00:48:53.940 --> 00:49:00.627]  And they've got hundreds of just mainline, high-quality herbs and vitamins and minerals that have been well documented to have nutritive and health effects.
[00:49:01.748 --> 00:49:03.710]  And you can go to www.prisonplanet.com.
[00:49:04.651 --> 00:49:11.654]  NewVitality.com or call 800-569-4056 and ask them for a catalog or brochure.
[00:49:11.674 --> 00:49:11.734]  1-800-569-4056.
[00:49:12.115 --> 00:49:16.257]  Some of their products are aloes, colon, and body cleanse.
[00:49:16.477 --> 00:49:19.138]  Really good at flushing out and detoxifying.
[00:49:19.198 --> 00:49:21.419]  Or Super Beta Prostate for men above 45.
[00:49:22.019 --> 00:49:22.440]  Excellent.
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:23.660]  Super Beta Prostate.
[00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:23.740]  1-800-569-4056.
[00:49:27.942 --> 00:49:29.983]  I certainly hope that you will check that out.
[00:49:30.023 --> 00:49:52.730]  I certainly hope that you will give them a call and that you will find out about the line of great products that they have at www.NewVitality.com We're going to come back with the final segment and I'm going to dig around here because I had several stories I wanted to cover and
[00:49:54.585 --> 00:50:01.892]  I'm not finding them here so I'll use this break to find those and I'll take a few final calls.
[00:50:03.654 --> 00:50:15.947]  But the key to all this is just the lawlessness of the Denver Police admitting that they attacked their own police to blame it on the citizenry to give a bad name to protesting.
[00:50:16.167 --> 00:50:17.849]  Because the agenda is to ban protesting.
[00:50:18.697 --> 00:50:22.080]  Because the government wants to do really bad things to us and knows that we're going to revolt against it.
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:25.964]  They don't want the image of the people not going along with it on TV.
[00:50:26.845 --> 00:50:29.707]  Well, the same thing goes with the New York Times admitting that the U.S.
[00:50:29.747 --> 00:50:37.454]  government staged all these terror attacks inside Iran for the last five years, trying to get Iran to attack us back.
[00:50:38.115 --> 00:50:39.816]  I mean, that's a criminal government, folks.
[00:50:40.477 --> 00:50:42.419]  We've got a really evil government.
[00:50:44.404 --> 00:50:45.985]  And it's not our government.
[00:50:46.385 --> 00:50:51.967]  It's just a private corporate management group that does whatever it wants, whenever it wants, however it wants.
[00:50:53.327 --> 00:50:59.530]  So I'm going to dig that out there in the break and go over it.
[00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:01.850]  And I'm starting to get desensitized.
[00:51:01.931 --> 00:51:07.693]  All these world leaders calling for world government and then our media never says, Oh, Alex Jones was right.
[00:51:09.613 --> 00:51:11.294]  Hello, I'm Steve Shane.
[00:51:11.954 --> 00:51:14.957]  We're entering a holiday season never before seen in America.
[00:51:15.417 --> 00:51:23.824]  We're thankful for the warning given by members of Mr. Obama's campaign team of the coming international incident, which will force unpopular decisions.
[00:51:24.245 --> 00:51:34.193]  Without this warning, many of us who still have money available would have unknowingly wasted it on Christmas gifts that will be useless when the only food available is in a government breadline.
[00:51:34.434 --> 00:51:38.157]  When the President is faced with the expected national security incident,
[00:51:38.592 --> 00:51:42.795]  The in-place Patriot legislation will control transport and distribution of food.
[00:51:43.275 --> 00:51:47.358]  Those of us who are able to take care of ourselves must put in supplies of food.
[00:51:47.598 --> 00:51:53.342]  This will free up the relief organizations to give food to those unable or not smart enough to prepare.
[00:51:53.722 --> 00:51:56.564]  The greatest gift this Christmas is life itself.
[00:51:56.905 --> 00:51:58.866]  Food for these unknown times.
[00:51:59.226 --> 00:52:00.667]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com 800-409-5633
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:10.301]  It is a big idea.
[00:52:10.321 --> 00:52:12.423]  A New World Order.
[00:52:13.124 --> 00:52:17.728]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:52:18.008 --> 00:52:20.831]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:52:20.851 --> 00:52:23.093]  Put their objective to be world domination.
[00:52:23.633 --> 00:52:26.075]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:52:26.816 --> 00:52:34.142]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:52:37.165 --> 00:52:42.148]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:52:42.609 --> 00:52:46.091]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:52:46.471 --> 00:52:48.993]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:52:49.033 --> 00:52:50.174]  Most people have no idea.
[00:52:50.194 --> 00:52:50.974]  They're not after money.
[00:52:50.994 --> 00:52:52.055]  They have all the money they need.
[00:52:52.255 --> 00:52:52.976]  They're after power.
[00:52:53.256 --> 00:52:54.377]  That's what they're after these years.
[00:52:54.397 --> 00:52:58.940]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:02.622]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:53:03.122 --> 00:53:03.503]  Endgame.
[00:53:03.883 --> 00:53:05.584]  Blueprint for global enslaving.
[00:53:05.924 --> 00:53:06.945]  You have been warned.
[00:53:07.965 --> 00:53:10.906]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:53:11.066 --> 00:53:16.308]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:53:16.588 --> 00:53:21.930]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:53:22.290 --> 00:53:23.410]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:53:23.770 --> 00:53:32.673]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:53:33.093 --> 00:53:34.715]  Now, compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[00:53:34.935 --> 00:53:39.100]  All natural, earth-friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:43.805]  They're safe, and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[00:53:44.166 --> 00:53:45.828]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[00:53:47.970 --> 00:53:49.291]  Alright, it's the final segment.
[00:53:49.311 --> 00:53:52.733]  I'm tempted to go into overdrive so I can talk to Chloe and Michelle and Chris and
[00:54:18.777 --> 00:54:21.639]  Aaron, BL, BL's next.
[00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:23.661]  And I meant to get into this.
[00:54:23.741 --> 00:54:26.883]  I mentioned this on the Sunday Show, and I never even got to it today.
[00:54:28.224 --> 00:54:30.125]  It's actually a CBC documentary.
[00:54:31.186 --> 00:54:40.973]  The Disappearing Male, and it admits that just the chemicals in plastic are deforming and sterilizing men, but they don't tell you that was all done by design.
[00:54:41.814 --> 00:54:46.618]  And you notice the EPA is not saying
[00:54:48.274 --> 00:54:48.554]  Hi Alex.
[00:55:12.426 --> 00:55:28.260]  Thanks to the efforts of Attorney Berg, Dr. Corsi, your organization, Matt Bruce in Florida, so many others, it's coming out and getting some traction in the media that we seem to have elected an illegal alien as president.
[00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:36.227]  That brings up some serious constitutional issues here, assuming that it gets some traction with the Supremes.
[00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:40.562]  I'm just wondering where we go from there.
[00:55:40.983 --> 00:55:42.203]  Does that leave us with Bush?
[00:55:42.303 --> 00:55:43.764]  Do we have the election over again?
[00:55:43.784 --> 00:55:45.185]  That's a crisis.
[00:55:45.265 --> 00:55:50.109]  No, you'd end up with Biden, and yeah, then they'd have some type of special election probably.
[00:55:50.649 --> 00:55:53.451]  But if it came out now before the Electoral College,
[00:55:54.051 --> 00:55:59.193]  That's why they have that, is so that the states... People say, well, that bypasses popular vote.
[00:55:59.273 --> 00:56:03.615]  No, it's your state legislature, which you also elected as another check and balance.
[00:56:04.436 --> 00:56:09.618]  Then the Electoral College would not elect Obama and would put McCain in.
[00:56:10.478 --> 00:56:13.980]  The problem is, of course, then the new world order would still win, because he's total globalist.
[00:56:15.701 --> 00:56:16.161]  It's a mess.
[00:56:17.442 --> 00:56:20.323]  But, I mean, by getting traction, it is in the news that
[00:56:21.423 --> 00:56:29.406]  It isn't just the issue of that his mother didn't live here long enough and did have him out of the country and that they falsify the birth certificate and won't show the original.
[00:56:29.787 --> 00:56:35.469]  It's also the issue of his real name being something else and now even who his dad is being in question.
[00:56:36.109 --> 00:56:37.770]  But that's why the elite chose him.
[00:56:37.830 --> 00:56:42.412]  It's because there's so much dirt on Barkie.
[00:56:44.893 --> 00:56:45.694]  Barry Sidoro?
[00:56:46.934 --> 00:56:47.134]  Yeah.
[00:56:49.847 --> 00:56:58.476]  Fort Worth on Friday at one of the big ammunition discounters and I couldn't get, I could hardly get anything.
[00:56:58.656 --> 00:57:04.763]  Less than 24 hours before they had gotten a million dollar shipment of ammunition and you couldn't get any.
[00:57:06.263 --> 00:57:11.469]  You couldn't get shotgun shells, you couldn't get most handgun ammunition, a lot of rifle ammunition.
[00:57:11.650 --> 00:57:13.232]  I mean, you can't get it, Alex.
[00:57:13.332 --> 00:57:16.996]  Well, I mean, I had a whole article here today that I never got to.
[00:57:17.016 --> 00:57:19.379]  I was kicking myself during the break looking at all this.
[00:57:20.422 --> 00:57:23.844]  Where it was a mainstream news article listing all the gun control.
[00:57:24.384 --> 00:57:26.085]  And by the way, the article's for it.
[00:57:26.826 --> 00:57:27.766]  How great it is.
[00:57:27.786 --> 00:57:30.908]  And I mean, he's coming after everything.
[00:57:31.308 --> 00:57:33.209]  So I guess in a way it's change.
[00:57:33.730 --> 00:57:39.633]  Because like I said, every president we get is just going to get worse, regardless of what color they are or what party.
[00:57:39.933 --> 00:57:42.075]  Because the agenda is just building, BL.
[00:57:42.835 --> 00:57:44.396]  Change only a globalist could love.
[00:57:45.387 --> 00:57:50.130]  Well, I mean, did you ever... I mean, we're living to see them call for world government and Limbaugh isn't talking about it.
[00:57:52.832 --> 00:57:55.374]  I guess they've printed enough money to buy everybody off.
[00:57:56.294 --> 00:58:01.378]  Yeah, and then they're going to leave us holding the bag with the debt for the money they issued to buy everybody off.
[00:58:03.248 --> 00:58:04.708]  It's the old Chinese curse, Alex.
[00:58:04.808 --> 00:58:06.269]  May you live in interesting times.
[00:58:06.609 --> 00:58:07.389]  Well, we do, buddy.
[00:58:07.449 --> 00:58:08.369]  I appreciate your call.
[00:58:08.389 --> 00:58:09.209]  Good to hear from you.
[00:58:09.489 --> 00:58:12.470]  Yeah, all records were broken in the last week for gun sales.
[00:58:13.050 --> 00:58:13.630]  Ammo sales.
[00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:14.770]  You can go pull that up.
[00:58:14.830 --> 00:58:15.330]  It's everywhere.
[00:58:15.890 --> 00:58:17.851]  Just every state level, federal record.
[00:58:17.891 --> 00:58:19.351]  Just done good.
[00:58:19.951 --> 00:58:20.391]  I love it.
[00:58:20.651 --> 00:58:21.571]  More weapons.
[00:58:21.651 --> 00:58:22.651]  More firearms.
[00:58:23.312 --> 00:58:25.932]  Because it's a symbol that we're not gelded.
[00:58:26.472 --> 00:58:31.173]  We don't want to go to that, but it's that great final thing when, you know what?
[00:58:32.970 --> 00:58:39.473]  Everybody will know the time, but if they bring tyranny far enough, then you know what to do, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:39.493 --> 00:58:39.473]  1776.
[00:58:41.214 --> 00:58:47.557]  Rebroadcast starts right now at Infowars.com and on M&M's across the country throughout the evening.
[00:58:47.577 --> 00:58:48.297]  God bless you all.
[00:58:50.058 --> 00:58:53.560]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
