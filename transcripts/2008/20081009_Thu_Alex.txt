[00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.995]  Either you are with us... Now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:27.704]  Well, for the next hour we have Beth Harris on with us, and you know I'm neurotic about throwing in points, asking too many questions.
[00:00:27.744 --> 00:00:37.991]  She is the premier expert on election fraud, blackboxvoting.org, the non-profit, her incredible documentary, Hacking Democracy, back on HBO.
[00:00:38.291 --> 00:00:39.152]  Proving fraud.
[00:00:39.212 --> 00:00:40.072]  Proving scams.
[00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:44.575]  Proving that you can hack these systems, remote control thousands of systems.
[00:00:44.976 --> 00:00:46.397]  Proving it's designed for that.
[00:00:46.757 --> 00:00:50.279]  Catching them throwing out the computer tapes in the trash when they said they didn't have them.
[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.540]  I mean, so much.
[00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.123]  So, Bev, in the hour we've got together, I'm going to try to really give you the floor.
[00:00:55.483 --> 00:00:56.984]  Like, you're doing an hour presentation.
[00:00:57.204 --> 00:00:58.585]  I'll throw in a few questions here or there.
[00:00:58.665 --> 00:00:59.586]  Take us in and out of break.
[00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:00.927]  But I want you to really
[00:01:02.014 --> 00:01:13.371]  Overview, the basic history of the election fraud, not just the new touchscreens or systems, but the scantrons that are still centrally tabulated, where we're going, what happened in the
[00:01:16.482 --> 00:01:29.780]  You know, some of the anomalies we saw in problems earlier in the campaign, this year going to the primaries, and then now what you're seeing coming up 27 days away from the election right now.
[00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.642]  Which again, as you point out in your film,
[00:01:32.443 --> 00:01:32.703]  Well, great.
[00:01:32.743 --> 00:01:34.705]  It's always good to be here, Alex.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:12.883]  Yeah, well, in a nutshell, we converted our whole country, almost our whole country, except for about 600 small population hand sites.
[00:02:13.664 --> 00:02:18.325]  We converted it to secret vote counting, controlled by government insiders and vendors.
[00:02:19.565 --> 00:02:23.587]  Therefore, we actually transferred power.
[00:02:24.127 --> 00:02:24.907]  This is what we did.
[00:02:24.927 --> 00:02:29.168]  As a citizenry, we used to have control over our elections.
[00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:30.969]  We transferred power
[00:02:31.587 --> 00:02:33.308]  To government insiders and vendors.
[00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:41.675]  And people kind of act like I'm a radical when I say we don't actually have democratic elections anymore.
[00:02:41.975 --> 00:02:42.496]  But we don't.
[00:02:43.716 --> 00:02:53.204]  This is not the way the country was founded when we say, I'll tell you what, we're going to trust some insiders to count our votes in secret.
[00:02:53.544 --> 00:02:55.506]  But that's what we're really dealing with right now.
[00:02:56.246 --> 00:02:58.708]  And you're absolutely right what you started off with.
[00:02:58.748 --> 00:02:59.669]  Whoever's in power,
[00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.591]  We're at the mercy of whoever's in power and controls those systems, which is not a definition of freedom.
[00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:15.273]  So, you know, it started when we decided that we should use voting machines to vote.
[00:03:15.693 --> 00:03:25.115]  Now, I'm not against technology, but I am against, you know, just building something on mechanics without having a design specification.
[00:03:26.075 --> 00:03:30.616]  It's kind of like we went out and we built a big, big, tall building without an architect.
[00:03:31.977 --> 00:03:40.623]  The architect is actually the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, and it says the people must be sovereign over the government.
[00:03:40.903 --> 00:03:57.673]  Well, they left that part out, and they basically made vendors and insiders in the government sovereign, put it into voting machines that those people control, and said, here you go, this is our elections, we control them, trust us.
[00:03:58.354 --> 00:04:00.095]  So we've actually ceded power.
[00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.133]  And, you know, a lot of people say, well, what are we going to do for November 2008?
[00:04:05.253 --> 00:04:06.995]  It's like, well, you know what?
[00:04:07.035 --> 00:04:12.939]  You ceded power to a bunch of insiders, and we haven't gotten it back.
[00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:23.768]  So, um, you know, there's a kind of a bigger picture we can draw in terms of all kinds of specifics, but in a nutshell, that's what we're dealing with.
[00:04:23.788 --> 00:04:24.648]  All right, Bev, stay there.
[00:04:24.668 --> 00:04:25.149]  Quick break.
[00:04:26.769 --> 00:04:35.415]  For those who don't understand, not only is it non-transparent secret, every time Bev Harris spot checks them, every time, there's fraud, there's chicanery, there's lies.
[00:04:35.936 --> 00:04:40.999]  The systems are designed to be secretly snuck into and then have the visit erased.
[00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:42.721]  I mean, they're designed for fraud.
[00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:43.701]  Bev Harris, straight ahead.
[00:04:45.703 --> 00:04:47.124]  It is a big idea.
[00:04:47.144 --> 00:04:47.564]  Ted Jones?
[00:04:49.265 --> 00:04:49.686]  Yeah, John.
[00:04:49.986 --> 00:04:50.947]  Ted wants to talk to you real quick.
[00:04:50.967 --> 00:04:51.467]  We're on air.
[00:04:52.228 --> 00:04:52.648]  Oh, okay.
[00:04:52.668 --> 00:04:53.769]  I'll call him on the studio phone.
[00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:53.969]  Gotcha.
[00:05:00.422 --> 00:05:02.884]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:03.625 --> 00:05:10.953]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:13.962 --> 00:05:18.945]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:19.446 --> 00:05:22.888]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:23.288 --> 00:05:25.750]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:26.991]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:27.011 --> 00:05:27.771]  They're not after money.
[00:05:27.791 --> 00:05:28.892]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:29.072 --> 00:05:29.813]  They're after power.
[00:05:30.053 --> 00:05:30.893]  That's what they're after.

[00:05:42.721 --> 00:05:43.782]  You have been warned.
[00:05:46.303 --> 00:05:49.364]  You know, I know exactly what you're thinking when it comes to this economy.
[00:05:49.484 --> 00:05:50.765]  The banks are crashing.
[00:05:50.865 --> 00:05:52.346]  The stock market's a mess.
[00:05:52.466 --> 00:05:53.986]  There's the mortgage crisis.
[00:05:54.126 --> 00:05:55.927]  There's the lending crisis.
[00:05:56.067 --> 00:06:00.469]  There is the food and gasoline prices through the ceiling crisis.
[00:06:00.769 --> 00:06:02.290]  And we are paralyzed a little bit.
[00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.090]  We don't know exactly how to respond to it.
[00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:05.071]  I don't know what to say.
[00:06:05.091 --> 00:06:05.851]  What can you do?
[00:06:05.871 --> 00:06:06.711]  Do what you can do.
[00:06:06.732 --> 00:06:07.292]  That's what you do.
[00:06:07.332 --> 00:06:08.272]  You do what you can do.
[00:06:08.492 --> 00:06:10.153]  What I can do is I can put some food away.
[00:06:10.333 --> 00:06:11.854]  I know there's a global food shortage.
[00:06:12.054 --> 00:06:12.555]  I can read it.
[00:06:12.575 --> 00:06:15.597]  I can go to eFoodsDirect.com, read hundreds of articles about this.
[00:06:15.777 --> 00:06:19.981]  I can go up on the Google website and Google food shortage and see the world's a mess.
[00:06:20.161 --> 00:06:20.481]  I know it.
[00:06:20.581 --> 00:06:20.922]  You know it.
[00:06:21.002 --> 00:06:21.722]  Look at the prices.
[00:06:21.762 --> 00:06:22.383]  Look where they're headed.
[00:06:22.463 --> 00:06:23.043]  Be prepared.
[00:06:23.083 --> 00:06:23.704]  Take care of yourself.
[00:06:23.784 --> 00:06:29.729]  You owe your family some security, some sense of self-being, a little bit of self-reliance is a good idea right now.

[00:07:46.798 --> 00:07:52.823]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:07:53.424 --> 00:07:56.467]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:07:58.328 --> 00:08:05.715]  We have come a long way when I was talking about election fraud with the Collier brothers 13 years ago on air, and they've been doing it for a decade before that.
[00:08:07.585 --> 00:08:13.370]  It didn't matter if they had video of the League of Women Voters falsifying the ballots by hand in Florida.
[00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.291]  The news media wouldn't air it.
[00:08:16.032 --> 00:08:21.396]  But today we have the internet and people like Bev Harris, who's a corporate fraud investigator, an auditor.
[00:08:22.377 --> 00:08:25.700]  Well, she decided to look into it years ago and it's been quite a saga.
[00:08:26.633 --> 00:08:28.794]  And I know it's hard for some of you out there to believe this is happening.
[00:08:28.834 --> 00:08:37.716]  It's also hard to believe that the Goldman Sachs former head and his deputy are running the entire bailout, handing tens of billions personally to their own companies.
[00:08:39.017 --> 00:08:39.657]  But it's happening.
[00:08:39.917 --> 00:08:43.878]  Every law, every canon of a free society, every check and balance, gone.
[00:08:45.319 --> 00:08:48.860]  Diebold, Hardener Civics, Sequoia, all caught
[00:08:49.949 --> 00:08:50.689]  It's unbelievable.
[00:08:50.749 --> 00:08:58.393]  So, Bev Harris, I'm going to turn my mic off, I'm going to sit back, and we're going to go directly to you, blackboxvoting.org.
[00:08:58.993 --> 00:09:03.615]  I know the listeners know about this, but do your friends, your family, your neighbors, and do you really think you know?
[00:09:03.655 --> 00:09:18.702]  You know, I've seen Hacking Democracy twice, and as I said yesterday in the morning, I was already thinking about getting Bev on, I was on the treadmill, I wanted to be on for 30 minutes, ended up being on an hour, watching HBO in the garage with Bev Harris on it, and
[00:09:20.285 --> 00:09:21.126]  That's where I got my equipment.
[00:09:21.146 --> 00:09:21.987]  I don't have room in the house.
[00:09:22.888 --> 00:09:30.475]  And I'm in there watching her, and it's just... Even though I'd seen all this, even though I knew this, even before this stuff was in the film, I'd seen it on YouTube and Google.
[00:09:30.835 --> 00:09:32.777]  You know, the little clips she put out in pieces.
[00:09:33.198 --> 00:09:34.679]  Seeing it, just an hour of it.
[00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:37.242]  And that's stuff years ago!
[00:09:38.407 --> 00:09:42.288]  What this woman's done with her helpers and people supporting her is send people to prison!
[00:09:43.148 --> 00:09:44.349]  So financially support her.
[00:09:44.549 --> 00:09:45.189]  Support us!
[00:09:45.509 --> 00:09:49.230]  We're here, the alternative media, going toe-to-toe with the military-industrial complex.
[00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:52.491]  So, as Beth said, we don't have voting for all intents and purposes.
[00:09:53.652 --> 00:10:00.634]  You know, one of the really great people working on this issue is a lawyer by the name of Paul Leto.
[00:10:01.443 --> 00:10:12.412]  And he said the other day, in discussing what we're really dealing with, he said, you know, if one can keep their head while those around them are losing theirs, perhaps they don't quite understand the full extent of the problem.
[00:10:13.493 --> 00:10:15.274]  And I have to agree.
[00:10:16.055 --> 00:10:21.599]  People come to this slowly because I think it's something they don't want to see.
[00:10:21.779 --> 00:10:24.961]  It's like we want to believe we have the best country.
[00:10:25.002 --> 00:10:26.743]  We've been told that since we've been children.
[00:10:26.783 --> 00:10:29.405]  We have the best and goodest and most virtuous and
[00:10:29.918 --> 00:10:35.105]  And we do have that if you look at the people that are involved in this country.
[00:10:35.165 --> 00:10:36.828]  But it's because we're so good!
[00:10:37.328 --> 00:10:40.833]  But we don't have that in terms of the system.
[00:10:41.394 --> 00:10:44.298]  People have the idea that they think that we have these
[00:10:46.255 --> 00:10:48.617]  The systems that have checks and balances.
[00:10:48.717 --> 00:10:56.663]  What's so interesting is when I first started studying this, people said, well, don't worry about the flaws with the voting machines because we have checks and balances that would catch it.
[00:10:57.023 --> 00:11:00.225]  So I spent the last two years evaluating the checks and balances.
[00:11:00.765 --> 00:11:01.606]  They don't use them.
[00:11:02.587 --> 00:11:06.970]  The checks and balances are every bit as broken down as the voting machine system.
[00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:13.267]  So, then they say, well, it's not that important that the seals weren't on the thing and that the seal numbers didn't match.
[00:11:13.328 --> 00:11:14.169]  It's like, well, wait a minute.
[00:11:14.189 --> 00:11:21.999]  You're telling me that it's okay if the machines are defective because you have checks and balances, and now you're telling me the checks and balances aren't that important.
[00:11:22.875 --> 00:11:26.018]  What you're really telling me is, don't trust the system.
[00:11:26.438 --> 00:11:27.760]  Well, Bev, I want you to start over.
[00:11:30.162 --> 00:11:32.304]  I want you to roll through all of this because it's so incredible.
[00:11:32.344 --> 00:11:34.246]  But what you just said, I want to restate that.
[00:11:34.606 --> 00:11:39.671]  It's like coming home, opening your door up, and the couches, the TVs, everything has been stolen.
[00:11:40.332 --> 00:11:43.835]  People have come in on the weekend, in a few hours, and taken everything.
[00:11:44.056 --> 00:11:45.957]  Robberies like that happen every day in every city.
[00:11:46.398 --> 00:11:47.379]  And you're in shock.
[00:11:47.899 --> 00:11:55.723]  And exactly, because the general public are good, they can't imagine they're actually being taken at every level by a criminal tyranny.
[00:11:56.143 --> 00:11:56.963]  Now, I'm going to shut up.
[00:11:57.003 --> 00:11:57.944]  Go ahead and walk through that.
[00:11:59.044 --> 00:12:15.392]  Well, you know, even, I think one of the things that sometimes helps, people get excited when we talk about fraud, but we don't even have to prove fraud, because what got taken away from us was the ability to control the system at all.
[00:12:16.144 --> 00:12:27.246]  So, it's like, suppose you own a small business and you are told you're not going to be allowed to see what your bookkeeper did with the money, you're just not allowed to see it.
[00:12:29.087 --> 00:12:33.008]  You know, it obviously, you don't own that business anymore, right?
[00:12:33.288 --> 00:12:34.028]  You really don't.
[00:12:34.108 --> 00:12:35.148]  Your bookkeeper owns it.
[00:12:35.748 --> 00:12:37.629]  The situation we've got in the U.S.
[00:12:37.669 --> 00:12:39.709]  is that we don't have control anymore.
[00:12:40.589 --> 00:12:51.137]  And so we, of course, of course when you don't control it and people can gain power and money when they do control it, those people will commit crimes and those people will commit fraud.
[00:12:52.599 --> 00:12:53.659]  It's how it's going to happen.
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:13:04.888]  Some of them will be honest, but it is not, it's not freedom to have to depend on insiders being honest and benevolent.
[00:13:05.949 --> 00:13:06.990]  That's not freedom.
[00:13:07.617 --> 00:13:28.227]  And so what we have to understand is right now the system we've got took away our fundamental civil rights, and took away our freedoms, and until we get control of the election system again, no amount of, well this election official is honest, she's a good one, don't worry about her, that is not the point.
[00:13:28.727 --> 00:13:31.268]  The point is we have to be able to control the system.
[00:13:32.324 --> 00:13:40.687]  It's just exactly like if you are a business owner and someone says, well, you can't see what happened to your money, but trust me, your bookkeeper is a nice lady.
[00:13:41.688 --> 00:13:43.008]  None of us would accept that.
[00:13:43.368 --> 00:13:46.729]  Or sometimes they say, we're going to propose a system now.
[00:13:46.809 --> 00:13:50.651]  Boy, the mitigations they come up with are just even dumber than the problem.
[00:13:50.891 --> 00:14:01.535]  They've got one now where the guy, some scientist from Stanford is saying, well, I've got one where you can check your own vote and it relies on invisible ink to make sure it's secure.
[00:14:02.358 --> 00:14:07.581]  And I'm thinking, okay, so that sounds a little bit like the Emperor's New Clothes.
[00:14:07.781 --> 00:14:09.762]  Invisible ink and you can check one vote.
[00:14:09.982 --> 00:14:15.345]  If you own a business, imagine if they say, you can check one transaction, that's all.
[00:14:15.965 --> 00:14:19.467]  And your bank will just tell you what you have in the bank besides that.
[00:14:19.487 --> 00:14:20.127]  Just trust them.
[00:14:20.707 --> 00:14:23.969]  So, you know, we've got a situation where we've lost control of it.
[00:14:24.469 --> 00:14:27.871]  And until we regain control, people will be cheating.
[00:14:28.388 --> 00:14:29.069]  Of course!
[00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:34.654]  Because there's power and money, and they've always cheated in elections, even when they were very open and public.
[00:14:34.674 --> 00:14:40.179]  You know, LBJ back in 1948 got caught cheating in Texas.
[00:14:40.799 --> 00:14:42.641]  So, it's nothing new.
[00:14:43.442 --> 00:14:46.665]  But what is new is that they have removed public control.
[00:14:50.668 --> 00:14:52.430]  So, ask me a question, Alex.
[00:14:53.991 --> 00:14:54.532]  Well, Bev,
[00:14:56.007 --> 00:14:57.028]  I mean, I'm just listening to you.
[00:14:57.048 --> 00:14:58.769]  I want you to walk through this for people.
[00:14:58.789 --> 00:15:05.213]  I mean, you like to prove the fact that it can't be confirmed and it's designed so it can be covered up, but you have caught them cheating.
[00:15:05.253 --> 00:15:08.075]  You have caught them violating things.
[00:15:08.095 --> 00:15:09.956]  You have caught them rigging votes.
[00:15:10.416 --> 00:15:18.722]  And the polls come out, which were always accurate in the past, in the exit polls, showing that somebody's going to win, but if they're anti-establishment, they lose.
[00:15:18.782 --> 00:15:25.046]  And it's the perfect system, because once you've stolen the right to vote, once you have the fraud in place, it's hard for the people
[00:15:25.986 --> 00:15:29.788]  To ever throw the rascals out, because they're in control of the whole system.
[00:15:30.128 --> 00:15:31.329]  Right, that's the key.
[00:15:31.409 --> 00:15:34.931]  I mean, you have to have a system where you can throw the bums out, if they're bums, right?
[00:15:35.751 --> 00:15:46.256]  A lot of times I have people come to me and say, well, the system is actually going to be okay in Oregon, because we have a good Secretary of State and we really like our mail-in voting and our election official is honest.
[00:15:47.016 --> 00:15:51.999]  And when I tell them, okay, take your Oregon election system and take it to Kentucky,
[00:15:53.106 --> 00:16:02.608]  Where we still have, you know, Festus and Buford sometimes running the local government with their family, and sometimes the sheriff is the drug dealer.
[00:16:03.028 --> 00:16:05.809]  And tell me if your organ system works there.
[00:16:06.029 --> 00:16:09.850]  Well, they always admit, well, no, it won't work if the insider is crooked.
[00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:12.750]  Well, then it's not acceptable.
[00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:15.171]  It has to be in public view, the whole thing.
[00:16:15.611 --> 00:16:16.771]  And you're right, you know.
[00:16:17.327 --> 00:16:29.010]  We have caught situations where there's fraud, but the bigger problem is that because they're counting in secret, they have set it up so that it's impossible to prove whether there was fraud or not.
[00:16:30.651 --> 00:16:37.853]  So, you see, we've actually lost something bigger than just, oh, they've created a tamperable system.
[00:16:38.653 --> 00:16:45.315]  And this is an important point because people think when they want to solve it, they go, oh, let's just build a more secure computer.
[00:16:46.158 --> 00:16:50.221]  But it doesn't actually solve it until you put the public back in control.
[00:16:50.241 --> 00:16:57.146]  But then you find out with the computers, with the systems, they've set it up so they can remotely access it and cover up they were even there.
[00:16:57.586 --> 00:17:07.053]  Then you go get the trash in county after county and you get the real paperwork that shows that it was the opposite of what they said.
[00:17:07.093 --> 00:17:13.457]  I mean you have caught them and people have gone to jail for rigging elections and we know what's going on and they've
[00:17:15.019 --> 00:17:16.660]  It's just so amazing to watch.
[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:23.886]  But what they will do, you see, is just make it harder to catch them by making it so that we can see even less information.
[00:17:24.226 --> 00:17:28.109]  Or they have... Their solution is going to be, let's hide more information.
[00:17:28.509 --> 00:17:29.110]  Well, I agree.
[00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:30.871]  And then we've had the state commissions.
[00:17:31.412 --> 00:17:33.433]  I remember here in Texas, we caught them in election fraud.
[00:17:33.473 --> 00:17:39.398]  They said double-counting ballot boxes, falsifying signatures, breaking safety seals, double-counting boxes.
[00:17:39.878 --> 00:17:41.620]  And then the state said it was an accident.
[00:17:42.193 --> 00:17:44.374]  Oh, I'm glad you brought that up.
[00:17:44.434 --> 00:17:46.015]  I call it the oops excuse.
[00:17:47.235 --> 00:17:51.297]  I have less polite words for it, but let's call it that.
[00:17:51.818 --> 00:17:54.579]  And you see, it's like running out the clock.
[00:17:54.639 --> 00:18:06.605]  It's like if in basketball you could, you know, commit a foul and say oops and then run out the clock and get your basket anyway and then say, but my basket still counts because it was an accident that I ran over that guy.
[00:18:07.045 --> 00:18:10.907]  You know, elections are all about running out the clock.
[00:18:11.784 --> 00:18:16.885]  So, in politics, they do anything they can get away with and say, oops, if they possibly can.
[00:18:17.165 --> 00:18:20.986]  And so they like to set things up so that it has plausible deniability.
[00:18:21.666 --> 00:18:23.787]  And you should see the oops excuses.
[00:18:24.067 --> 00:18:25.387]  They're ridiculous.
[00:18:25.948 --> 00:18:31.589]  In New Mexico, in the primary, now, we have the voting machines.
[00:18:32.082 --> 00:18:34.824]  That was pushed in through this Help America Vote Act.
[00:18:34.864 --> 00:18:37.425]  Yeah, where the Feds pay to put the fraud machines in.
[00:18:37.545 --> 00:18:47.811]  In 2004, it's in the film, Kerry even admitted that, well wait a minute, the exit polls all show I won, but I won everywhere except where we have the computer machines, and everywhere there he lost.
[00:18:48.251 --> 00:18:48.451]  Right.
[00:18:48.891 --> 00:18:55.455]  Well now, we put the voting machines in with this Help America Vote Act.
[00:18:56.303 --> 00:18:57.844]  And there was two parts to it.
[00:18:58.124 --> 00:19:02.067]  The second part is going to come to play for the first time in 2008.
[00:19:03.488 --> 00:19:14.316]  And that is, in addition to having the voting machines, we now have, for the first time in every state, a statewide centralized database of the voters.
[00:19:15.537 --> 00:19:19.800]  Now, these databases could really be messed with in New Mexico in the primary,
[00:19:20.347 --> 00:19:23.029]  A whole bunch of people couldn't vote because they weren't on the list.
[00:19:23.109 --> 00:19:23.549]  That's right.
[00:19:23.569 --> 00:19:25.391]  We're always coming... We gave you the wrong list.
[00:19:25.411 --> 00:19:25.851]  We gotta break.
[00:19:25.871 --> 00:19:26.451]  We gotta break.
[00:19:26.491 --> 00:19:26.812]  Stay there.
[00:19:26.832 --> 00:19:27.912]  We'll come back and explain this.
[00:19:28.353 --> 00:19:32.996]  Folks, it isn't just that they're stealing votes and flipping votes with the computers and cheating people.
[00:19:33.356 --> 00:19:38.860]  Now they're, they've always done this, but now in a greater extent they're throwing people off who aren't felons, who aren't criminals.
[00:19:39.861 --> 00:19:43.924]  So they're also using computers with the databases of voters to keep people
[00:19:44.184 --> 00:19:45.126]  From Voting, stay with us.
[00:19:54.696 --> 00:19:55.737]  But who is the enemy?
[00:19:56.218 --> 00:19:56.758]  Bin Laden.
[00:19:57.039 --> 00:19:57.999]  This is his MO.
[00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.341]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:19:59.381 --> 00:20:01.023]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:20:01.383 --> 00:20:08.150]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:08.971]  Some U.S.
[00:20:09.031 --> 00:20:14.717]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:20:15.357 --> 00:20:18.860]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:21.663]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:20:45.379 --> 00:20:55.027]  In a world of government oppression and tyranny, the struggle between freedom and fascism comes a story about two people who are faced with the challenge to stand up and do the right thing for liberty.
[00:20:55.047 --> 00:20:58.390]  Her face was every face I've ever known.
[00:20:58.857 --> 00:21:00.577]  Your face was my own face.
[00:21:00.857 --> 00:21:03.178]  GCN brings you Uncivil Liberties.

[00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:14.301]  The enemy of my enemy is my ally.

[00:21:48.677 --> 00:21:51.602]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:21:51.743 --> 00:21:54.588]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:21:54.608 --> 00:21:57.454]  It's not who votes that counts, it's who counts the votes.

[00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:49.512]  Would you like to know how you can use water as fuel and laugh at the rising price of gas?
[00:22:49.972 --> 00:22:51.933]  Then keep listening for a very special offer.
[00:22:52.492 --> 00:22:57.813]  GasFreedom.info has the information you need to learn about the newest hydrogen technology available.
[00:22:58.153 --> 00:23:01.334]  GasFreedom is an affordable, practical, free energy device.
[00:23:01.874 --> 00:23:06.756]  It uses electricity from your car's battery to separate water into a gas called HHO.
[00:23:07.376 --> 00:23:11.957]  HHO, also called browns gas, burns efficiently and provides the energy your car needs.
[00:23:12.397 --> 00:23:15.358]  In just 10 minutes, you'll discover exactly how this is possible.
[00:23:15.738 --> 00:23:17.898]  This is the secret the oil companies don't want you to know.
[00:23:18.318 --> 00:23:20.679]  Learn how easy it is to extract energy from water
[00:23:20.879 --> 00:23:21.479]  We're good to go.
[00:23:52.262 --> 00:24:02.357]  Okay, let's go right back to Bev Harris as she continues to break down the different ways they're disenfranchising voters.
[00:24:03.038 --> 00:24:05.241]  Not just at the ballot box, but keeping them from getting
[00:24:06.138 --> 00:24:14.461]  To the ballot box, and then I want to go through all the evidence of tampering and where she sees this election going up that we're less than a month away from.
[00:24:14.521 --> 00:24:15.041]  Beth Harris?
[00:24:15.481 --> 00:24:23.904]  Yeah, well it's not even... You know, people often talk about these voter lists as keeping people from the ballots, but it's actually worse than that.
[00:24:24.444 --> 00:24:30.586]  What they have is the ability to turn on and off people's eligibility in the middle of an election.
[00:24:32.116 --> 00:24:38.399]  Let me kind of run down some examples that I have been able to prove out, okay?
[00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:49.926]  In Georgia, in 2006, elderly people, senior citizens, were coming into the polls and they were trying to vote and they were told, you've already voted.
[00:24:51.226 --> 00:24:53.327]  And of course, so that would disenfranchise them, right?
[00:24:53.668 --> 00:24:59.491]  Well, some of the elderly people really asserted themselves and they said, no, you know, I know I haven't voted,
[00:25:00.231 --> 00:25:03.992]  And so they would call up and ask what to do, the poll workers.
[00:25:04.012 --> 00:25:05.953]  This is according to the poll workers' own notes.
[00:25:06.653 --> 00:25:09.715]  And they were told, tell them to come back this afternoon.
[00:25:10.575 --> 00:25:16.577]  So the senior citizens came back that afternoon, and lo and behold, they said, oh, you can vote, you haven't already voted.
[00:25:17.677 --> 00:25:27.021]  Now what that tells you, they were using an electronic poll book, which was interfacing with the electronic database that's held by the state now, that's centralized.
[00:25:27.688 --> 00:25:34.889]  And what that tells you is that they were able to turn on and off these people's eligibility during the middle of the vote.
[00:25:34.949 --> 00:25:41.931]  So they would have a bunch of eligibility turned off, targeting senior citizens, thinking they might forget or not be assertive, I suppose.
[00:25:42.971 --> 00:25:45.651]  And if they asserted themselves, they could turn it back on again.
[00:25:46.931 --> 00:25:55.693]  Now, in Lake County, Indiana, and this, I think what we need to look at these databases as is a room full of on and off switches.
[00:25:56.954 --> 00:26:01.777]  In Lake County, Indiana, they had a number of absentee ballots, which they had ruled ineligible.
[00:26:02.957 --> 00:26:15.804]  They come in, and all of a sudden, one day, they see that, this is shortly after the election, they see that they're all eligible, because the absentee ballots, whether they're eligible or ineligible, is in a computer program now.
[00:26:16.656 --> 00:26:19.678]  And all these ineligibles were made eligible.
[00:26:20.399 --> 00:26:25.542]  So they contacted the state because they knew they didn't do it in Lake County, Indiana.
[00:26:26.123 --> 00:26:28.785]  It was done remotely from the state database.
[00:26:29.485 --> 00:26:33.928]  The vendor for the state database admitted it and said they were just testing something.
[00:26:34.049 --> 00:26:35.370]  It didn't affect the results.
[00:26:38.372 --> 00:26:39.853]  Now, how scary is that?
[00:26:40.433 --> 00:26:42.755]  Basically, you have someone at a switchboard
[00:26:43.749 --> 00:26:57.147]  Who can activate and deactivate absentee ballots in the middle of an election during the count, and you have somebody who can activate and deactivate a person's eligibility to vote in the middle of election day.
[00:26:58.249 --> 00:27:01.493]  That's what these voter databases are really enabling.
[00:27:04.764 --> 00:27:22.355]  Now Bev, there are also other things like, and it's always in key demographics, if Democrats are controlling a county or a voting district, magically in the Republican areas they'll give them a tenth of the machines that are needed for the average voter turnout.
[00:27:22.995 --> 00:27:26.058]  But then in the Democratic areas, there'll be plenty of machines.
[00:27:26.538 --> 00:27:35.987]  Vice versa, like Ohio, in areas where they know it's going to go 9 to 1, say a black area, for John Kerry, magically there's two machines for 10,000 people.
[00:27:36.467 --> 00:27:39.510]  And then in the Republican area, there's a machine for every thousand.
[00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:42.473]  So there's all sorts of tricks that are being played here.
[00:27:42.493 --> 00:27:47.337]  And then you also expose weird cash payments by the Republican Party
[00:27:48.818 --> 00:27:57.502]  that are made to Diebold and others at a county-by-county basis that aren't campaign contributions right before elections.
[00:27:57.542 --> 00:27:58.403]  I mean, this is amazing.
[00:27:58.843 --> 00:27:59.103]  Right.
[00:27:59.303 --> 00:28:06.106]  Well, and, you know, there were also very large cash contributions from Diebold to Ken Blackwell.
[00:28:06.466 --> 00:28:09.868]  He got some stock, I guess, that he was given and so forth.
[00:28:09.888 --> 00:28:13.589]  But let's go back to what you were talking about.
[00:28:13.729 --> 00:28:17.131]  Before we got to the cash contributions, you had something I wanted to address.
[00:28:18.527 --> 00:28:22.428]  It was, oh golly, it's already slipped my mind what I wanted to say.
[00:28:23.788 --> 00:28:27.129]  Well, let me remind you, I was talking about how they would have less machines.
[00:28:27.509 --> 00:28:28.909]  Oh yeah, that's what I wanted to address.
[00:28:29.609 --> 00:28:34.890]  This is going to be really interesting because in some of this stuff, it's just stupid.
[00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:37.130]  It's not criminal, it's just stupid.
[00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:43.692]  What they did was they decided that everybody had to go out and buy these touchscreen and DRE voting machines in Texas.
[00:28:43.732 --> 00:28:45.852]  You use a lot of heart, which is a dial-a-vote thing.
[00:28:46.816 --> 00:28:53.539]  And it takes a certain amount of time for each person to vote on those machines because they have to monopolize the machine while they're on it.
[00:28:53.639 --> 00:28:57.660]  It's not like the paper ballots where they can go off in a corner and then just run it through later.
[00:28:58.541 --> 00:29:03.182]  Well, what they did not anticipate is an election that might have a higher turnout.
[00:29:03.602 --> 00:29:09.945]  So they only allocated not even enough money to buy the machines and not enough to buy the machines for a high turnout.
[00:29:12.526 --> 00:29:13.747]  Bev Harris, we're going to come back.
[00:29:13.847 --> 00:29:15.168]  Long segment coming up.
[00:29:15.208 --> 00:29:16.389]  Plenty of time to break it down.
[00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:21.034]  I want to get into what you see happening in the election in 27 days.
[00:29:22.395 --> 00:29:30.682]  In hindsight, integrating information we have from the primaries just six, seven months ago and all the shenanigans and activities we saw there.
[00:29:30.702 --> 00:29:32.123]  And then ways to counter this.
[00:29:32.564 --> 00:29:33.324]  Solutions!
[00:29:35.526 --> 00:29:36.447]  We're on the march.
[00:29:36.927 --> 00:29:38.429]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:39.421 --> 00:29:42.282]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:45.303 --> 00:29:47.323]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:29:47.443 --> 00:29:49.844]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:29:49.864 --> 00:29:51.984]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:29:52.124 --> 00:29:53.665]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:29:53.685 --> 00:29:55.325]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:29:55.385 --> 00:29:58.226]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:29:58.286 --> 00:30:01.927]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:30:11.571 --> 00:30:16.515]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:30:16.716 --> 00:30:18.877]  An inside job?
[00:30:20.239 --> 00:30:21.280]  How dare you?
[00:30:22.681 --> 00:30:27.745]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:30:27.765 --> 00:30:30.187]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:30:30.247 --> 00:30:33.450]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years...
[00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:37.052]  We will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[00:30:42.215 --> 00:30:44.736]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:30:45.077 --> 00:30:48.138]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[00:30:48.499 --> 00:30:50.560]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:53.822]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[00:30:54.122 --> 00:31:00.605]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[00:31:00.986 --> 00:31:03.107]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.

[00:31:11.692 --> 00:31:15.375]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[00:31:15.615 --> 00:31:17.136]  Travel less, meet online.

[00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:06.310]  I'm good.
[00:32:24.795 --> 00:32:25.115]  I think so.
[00:32:51.252 --> 00:32:54.953]  Okay, Bev Harris, we've only got about 20 minutes left with you.
[00:32:55.033 --> 00:32:59.494]  Let's break down the rest of the story.
[00:33:00.254 --> 00:33:04.175]  As they say, people can find out more at blackboxvoting.org.
[00:33:04.975 --> 00:33:08.416]  They can also go to Amazon and other places and buy the great film, Hacking Democracy.
[00:33:08.816 --> 00:33:11.616]  If you don't have HBO, it's airing every couple days on HBO.
[00:33:11.676 --> 00:33:14.997]  Watch it and understand it's far worse than even that film covers.
[00:33:16.257 --> 00:33:27.146]  But, again, we need more Americans like Bev Harris and her cohorts going out, digging through the trash, always finding bad stuff at these voting systems companies, at the counties where the voting's happening.
[00:33:27.546 --> 00:33:35.773]  Go through the fraud we saw in the primary, what you see it building up to now, other facets, other areas we haven't gotten into, and then most importantly, solutions.
[00:33:35.793 --> 00:33:43.639]  I mean, the positive news that I've got for everybody here today is this.
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:49.182]  Ten years ago, you'd see polls, almost no one thought it was election fraud.
[00:33:49.542 --> 00:33:52.504]  Now, over 90% of major polls say they know it's a fraud.
[00:33:52.924 --> 00:33:58.667]  So the good news is, the establishment is not selling the lie that they're not engaging in orchestrated takeovers.
[00:33:58.707 --> 00:34:00.128]  So before you leave us, let's get into that.
[00:34:00.749 --> 00:34:07.752]  You can tackle that positive thing now, but let's continue to expose what's happening, where you see things going, and then, as I said, solutions.
[00:34:07.792 --> 00:34:08.233]  Bev Harris.
[00:34:08.773 --> 00:34:08.973]  Yeah.
[00:34:09.433 --> 00:34:12.195]  Well, every election that we've looked at, we've found
