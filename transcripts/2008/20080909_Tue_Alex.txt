[00:00:05.445 --> 00:00:06.066]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.746 --> 00:00:07.827]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.527 --> 00:00:09.648]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.268 --> 00:00:11.109]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:12.730]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.393]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.613 --> 00:00:21.736]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.779]  Iraq is a laboratory.
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.061]  Afghanistan is a laboratory.
[00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:34.264]  Georgia, South Ossetia, Abkhazia are laboratories.
[00:00:36.853 --> 00:00:42.457]  Laboratories in oppression, in scientific dictatorship, in elimination.
[00:00:44.418 --> 00:01:05.011]  And when you go to the RNC or the DNC and see the police state control grid, that is admittedly a laboratory on how to corral and suppress and control populations as we go forward into the brave new New World Order system and control grid.
[00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:17.979]  I raise that issue on this 9th day of September 2008, live Tuesday edition, because a secret killing program is key in Iraq, Bob Woodward says.
[00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:26.385]  The dramatic drop in violence in Iraq is due in large part to a secret program the U.S.
[00:01:26.405 --> 00:01:34.291]  military has used to kill terrorists, according to a new book by Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Bob Woodward.
[00:01:36.343 --> 00:01:42.025]  There's layer after layer after layer of lies and propaganda and deceit in this story.
[00:01:42.045 --> 00:01:42.926]  We're going to walk through it.
[00:01:44.707 --> 00:01:49.148]  Number one, notice that anyone who resists being occupied or killed is called a terrorist.
[00:01:52.230 --> 00:02:04.395]  They also cooked up a few years ago, even before the war started, a plan to go in, stage violence, liquidate the military, the government, so there'd be a civil war, then later pay off the warring factions,
[00:02:05.322 --> 00:02:06.122]  And declare victory.
[00:02:07.023 --> 00:02:09.584]  Victory is five and a half years of carnage.
[00:02:12.505 --> 00:02:14.865]  Victory is genocide against the Iraqi people.
[00:02:15.566 --> 00:02:19.967]  And then you say, oh, we just had this surge idea, it worked so great, we won the war.
[00:02:20.107 --> 00:02:21.788]  Victory, victory, victory.
[00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.390]  Meanwhile, it's all a big laboratory.
[00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.392]  In through-the-wall, ground-penetrating radar technology,
[00:02:34.301 --> 00:02:44.646]  New smart bombs, new smart guns, DU weapons, HUMET, spies, radiation guns.
[00:02:46.847 --> 00:03:02.255]  The program which Woodward compares to the World War II era Manhattan Project that developed the atomic bomb, see it's a huge, giant, secret program, must remain secret for now or it would get people killed, Woodward said Monday on CNN's Larry King Live.
[00:03:03.815 --> 00:03:10.520]  It's a wonderful example of how the American ingenuity solved a problem in war, as we often have, Woodward said.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.522]  Ah, see, America did a great job.
[00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:31.814]  While America's being dismantled, while the borders are being liquidated, while the dollar's being imploded, while Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are being bankrupted on the people's backs, while America ceases to exist, while its Bill of Rights and Constitution and Fourth Amendment end, they like to always tell you how it's for America.
[00:03:33.015 --> 00:03:45.064]  In The War Within, Secret Winehouse History, Woodward discloses the existence of secret operational capabilities developed by the military to locate, target, and kill leaders of an Al-Qaeda in Iraq and other insurgent leaders.
[00:03:47.286 --> 00:03:57.433]  National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley, in a written statement reacting to Woodward's book, acknowledged the new strategy, yet he disputed Woodward's conclusion that the surge of 30,000 U.S.
[00:03:57.693 --> 00:04:01.436]  troops in Iraq was not the primary reason for decline in violent attacks.
[00:04:02.561 --> 00:04:10.583]  It was the surge that provided more resources and a security context to support newly developed techniques and operations, Hadley wrote.
[00:04:15.825 --> 00:04:20.526]  So, if you think a million, 300,000 dead Iraqis, 5,000 dead U.S.
[00:04:20.566 --> 00:04:27.689]  troops, over 50,000 maimed, 5,000 that died in country, another 15,000 died outside.
[00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:29.149]  They cooked the books there like everything else.
[00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:34.341]  If you call our name being destroyed, lying to go to war, victory, then we had a victory.
[00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:37.663]  If you call this our government, then we had a victory.
[00:04:38.003 --> 00:04:39.084]  But we didn't have anything.
[00:04:40.865 --> 00:04:43.087]  We had America's name and treasury destroyed.
[00:04:44.788 --> 00:04:46.509]  But what are these super weapons?
[00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:50.332]  What is this super tactic that's as big as the Manhattan Project?
[00:04:52.633 --> 00:04:53.093]  What is it?
[00:04:54.214 --> 00:04:55.675]  We'll talk about that when we get back.
[00:04:56.436 --> 00:04:56.876]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.434 --> 00:05:11.060]  Cameras are everywhere, above stoplights, on toll booths, and scanning the freeways just waiting to snap a photo of your license plate, only to slam you with ridiculous fines.
[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.702]  In California, red light tickets are as high as $400.

[00:05:58.079 --> 00:05:59.499]  Don't give your money to the state.
[00:05:59.799 --> 00:06:00.500]  Spray your plate!
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.902]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:06:07.242 --> 00:06:08.522]  And we knew what to do.
[00:06:08.542 --> 00:06:10.303]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:06:10.543 --> 00:06:16.885]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:06:17.595 --> 00:06:26.142]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:06:26.483 --> 00:06:33.288]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:36.651]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:06:36.751 --> 00:06:41.816]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:06:42.516 --> 00:06:45.259]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:51.486]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[00:06:51.506 --> 00:06:54.129]  Or order the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:59.495]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:06.721]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[00:07:07.001 --> 00:07:11.762]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[00:07:11.782 --> 00:07:17.004]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[00:07:17.204 --> 00:07:20.645]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[00:07:21.125 --> 00:07:29.311]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[00:07:29.651 --> 00:07:34.615]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[00:07:35.456 --> 00:07:41.200]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.762]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[00:07:44.022 --> 00:07:46.465]  Cannot survive in an alkaline environment?

[00:08:05.442 --> 00:08:06.083]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.763 --> 00:08:07.824]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.525 --> 00:08:09.646]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.287 --> 00:08:11.128]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.868 --> 00:08:12.749]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:17.073]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.614 --> 00:08:21.738]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.439 --> 00:08:29.666]  To say that our entire economy, our civilization, has been shifted into a police state,
[00:08:36.227 --> 00:08:42.789]  It's being converted into a surveillance, eugenics, extermination grid.
[00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:52.531]  It is being turned into a mechanized dehumanization platform.
[00:08:54.252 --> 00:08:57.693]  And Bob Woodward comes out, hint hint, total spook that he is.
[00:08:57.713 --> 00:09:02.334]  He used to bring down Nixon because he wasn't playing ball and not defending Nixon.
[00:09:03.507 --> 00:09:13.592]  comes out and says, oh, the surge is wonderful, and Barack Obama says the surge is wonderful, and see, now a new administration's coming, whether it's Barack Obama or John McCain, it doesn't matter.
[00:09:13.932 --> 00:09:26.318]  So we have to start over new and con the public with a new birdcage liner, suck the public back in for another four to eight years, and accepting that we're getting legitimate change so we don't rebel.
[00:09:27.679 --> 00:09:29.160]  So we don't take our country back,
[00:09:30.309 --> 00:09:33.351]  Before the grid is fully in place.
[00:09:38.414 --> 00:09:58.085]  And remember, military and police, when you're dying of a controlled bio-attack, or when you're there by your child's bedside dying of an advanced viral leukemia, remember you were on a power trip, you like being stupid, you like serving the corrupt system, you love the lie,
[00:09:58.846 --> 00:10:06.211]  You love the power trip of the technocracy, and so you helped bring our civilization down.
[00:10:09.414 --> 00:10:23.964]  Are they going to say it's smart dust, nanotech dust, a modern rip-off of radioactive isotopes being left in the homes of political
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:31.885]  Enemies, so they could then track with special goggles where they walked, where they went, the meetings they went to.
[00:10:35.628 --> 00:10:43.214]  A modern example of that is Google, the NSA designed and run, CIA, MIT created, that's admitted.
[00:10:44.675 --> 00:10:45.596]  Do no evil.
[00:10:45.716 --> 00:10:46.756]  Ha, ha, ha!
[00:10:48.117 --> 00:10:49.559]  Oh, the government's not surveilling us.
[00:10:49.879 --> 00:10:51.440]  Ha, ha, ha!
[00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:52.741]  The government.
[00:10:53.826 --> 00:10:56.008]  The criminal rape gang on a power trip.
[00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:07.255]  Will it be satellites with pinpoint radiation beams?
[00:11:08.716 --> 00:11:21.965]  Will it be see-through wall, see-through wall, ground-penetrating radar, sonar,
[00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:38.223]  Will it be hunter-seeker biometric projectiles that scan the face of the target and then hunt and seek?
[00:11:39.623 --> 00:11:47.545]  Will it be little nanotech moths flying in off of pheromones and looking for their target?
[00:11:50.986 --> 00:11:53.706]  What it is, is made-up propaganda and bull.
[00:11:55.327 --> 00:11:56.307]  Oh, they've got
[00:11:57.489 --> 00:12:01.993]  C-130s and DC-10s with chemical lasers in their noses.
[00:12:04.314 --> 00:12:11.200]  They've got particle beams, radiation beams, microwave guns, that's all out there.
[00:12:13.281 --> 00:12:17.744]  Kind of like we had a national ID card in 1993 and they're just now telling the slaves now.
[00:12:18.225 --> 00:12:19.366]  It was not a secret.
[00:12:20.386 --> 00:12:22.168]  Just like we've had a North American Union since 2005.
[00:12:24.401 --> 00:12:26.542]  It's public, but not popularly known.
[00:12:27.103 --> 00:12:33.447]  So when they get around to telling the slaves, they'll... See, they just had the 50th anniversary last year of the European Union.
[00:12:35.648 --> 00:12:39.470]  And even a lot of Europeans went, well wait a minute, it didn't start until 2000, how's it the 50th?
[00:12:40.031 --> 00:12:46.175]  And they announced, the leaders of Europe said, oh well, it's really been around since 1957, with the Treaty of Rome.
[00:12:48.456 --> 00:12:51.478]  So this is just meant to intimidate and scare Russia and China,
[00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:55.211]  But at another level, they're being back-door given the technology.
[00:12:55.231 --> 00:12:57.411]  You've got to proliferate to keep the arms race going.
[00:12:59.892 --> 00:13:01.812]  Globalists, you know, hand out nukes here and there.
[00:13:02.052 --> 00:13:07.973]  Hand out nukes to India, hand out nukes to China, hand out nukes to Russia before that, hand out nukes to Pakistan.
[00:13:10.774 --> 00:13:17.635]  No, day one, the Pentagon went in and broke the country into three sectors, really four total.
[00:13:20.046 --> 00:13:23.067]  And then funded the groups to attack each other and had U.S.
[00:13:23.087 --> 00:13:40.134]  Special Forces, CIA, MI6, SAS go around and shoot our troops and shoot our military and shoot contractors and kill different religious leaders to stir up fights and attack police stations.
[00:13:40.774 --> 00:13:42.315]  And they were caught over and over again.
[00:13:42.855 --> 00:13:44.296]  And Mossad was caught as well.
[00:13:45.436 --> 00:13:46.737]  Even came out in mainstream news.
[00:13:52.279 --> 00:13:53.580]  I mean, they said what they do.
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:54.921]  I told you what they do.
[00:13:55.021 --> 00:14:01.707]  They go in, break the country in multiple parts, sow sectarian violence for five to seven years.
[00:14:01.727 --> 00:14:09.713]  That's what the Israelis and the Pentagon, Israel separately and the Israeli Defense Forces said they do.
[00:14:09.833 --> 00:14:12.275]  In 83, by the way, they wrote the plan.
[00:14:12.635 --> 00:14:13.696]  The Pentagon said that in 2000, 2001, 2003, 2002.
[00:14:19.469 --> 00:14:23.871]  And they went in and, oh my gosh, we can't lose the war, so they let that go on for four or five years.
[00:14:23.931 --> 00:14:33.654]  Then, oh, we got a surge, and all the surge was, was billions of dollars of payments a month to the warlords on a neighborhood-by-neighborhood basis.
[00:14:39.037 --> 00:14:44.399]  And if you want to corrupt the military, you just come in and give privates $30,000, sergeants $80,000, higher level sergeants $100,000, $200,000,
[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.642]  All the different ranks of sergeant.
[00:14:51.323 --> 00:14:52.984]  Millions and millions to colonels.
[00:14:55.447 --> 00:14:56.868]  Hundreds of millions to generals.
[00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:06.778]  By the head of CENTCOM, it's reported gets a cool billion a year.
[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:11.483]  That's how this works.
[00:15:12.671 --> 00:15:19.235]  And they come to our police chiefs, and our governors, and our mayors, and they bought them off at least 20 years ago.
[00:15:21.476 --> 00:15:25.959]  And if they don't take the payment, they get caught with a hooker.
[00:15:26.399 --> 00:15:28.701]  They get caught with drugs, or some corruption comes out.
[00:15:29.561 --> 00:15:30.722]  That one of their underlings did.
[00:15:32.203 --> 00:15:34.864]  And that's full spectrum domination.
[00:15:35.164 --> 00:15:37.906]  So when you hear ads like this one, for children,
[00:15:39.582 --> 00:15:42.863]  And then ads like the next one airing on radio and TV for adults.
[00:15:44.323 --> 00:15:45.204]  You know what it's about.
[00:15:45.324 --> 00:15:59.567]  Recruiting the criminal group that is radically expanding, that will run every facet of our lives through the green environmental bureaucrats and through the terror bureaucrats.
[00:15:59.887 --> 00:16:02.908]  The bureaucrats that fight terror but are really stozzy.
[00:16:02.928 --> 00:16:06.029]  You're going to have the hot pressure with the men in black
[00:16:07.731 --> 00:16:10.692]  And then you're going to have the cool pressure with the social services.
[00:16:11.673 --> 00:16:14.174]  And God help every one of us.
[00:16:16.194 --> 00:16:18.655]  You want social engineering on steroids times 10?
[00:16:18.756 --> 00:16:19.556]  You're going to get it.
[00:16:19.896 --> 00:16:21.937]  You want covert black ops in your daily life?
[00:16:22.277 --> 00:16:24.858]  You want something that makes the Soviet Union look tame?
[00:16:25.278 --> 00:16:31.561]  That makes Marcus Wolf and the Stasi, who they hired for consulting, look tame?
[00:16:31.661 --> 00:16:32.101]  This is it.
[00:16:34.119 --> 00:16:34.459]  Go ahead.
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.620]  Play whichever one you like first.
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.081]  The ones for children.
[00:16:39.422 --> 00:16:42.043]  About how they have little robot moths and how much fun it is.
[00:16:42.083 --> 00:16:44.205]  And you want to see secret technology.
[00:16:44.225 --> 00:16:45.205]  See they're enticing.
[00:16:45.485 --> 00:16:47.947]  And all the major toy lines are about spy kids.
[00:16:47.987 --> 00:16:50.728]  And the movies are about the kids being spies.
[00:16:50.768 --> 00:16:52.329]  And everything is how much fun it is.
[00:16:52.369 --> 00:16:54.750]  And now, oh, they're really saying, report on your parents.
[00:16:56.571 --> 00:17:00.773]  So they have you make, believe, and imagine, and dream first.
[00:17:00.814 --> 00:17:03.255]  And then they fulfill those dreams.
[00:17:04.542 --> 00:17:08.104]  And now they're enticing the country with, ooh, we're going to tell you about our secret weapons.
[00:17:08.124 --> 00:17:10.245]  See, that'll get us to be militarized and warlike.
[00:17:10.705 --> 00:17:15.788]  Ooh, you know, can we be hyped up and gotten, you know, real hyped up?
[00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:23.072]  Can we get crunked into loving it and getting into all of it?
[00:17:23.092 --> 00:17:25.254]  The TV shows, the MacGyver angle.
[00:17:25.814 --> 00:17:30.897]  Everybody loves the James Bond super weapons.
[00:17:33.419 --> 00:17:35.581]  The real superweapon is knowing who our enemy is.
[00:17:36.201 --> 00:17:38.683]  Knowing who's taking our children, who's poisoning us.
[00:17:38.983 --> 00:17:39.724]  You bastards.
[00:17:40.785 --> 00:17:46.169]  But here it is, the seduction of our children by the CIA, and then there's... Yeah, air the one for kids first.
[00:17:46.209 --> 00:17:50.151]  Here it is.
[00:17:50.172 --> 00:17:51.613]  Some of our bugs have been...
[00:17:57.884 --> 00:18:06.353]  At the CIA, our scientists and engineers create and apply innovative technology to meet intelligence needs.
[00:18:07.855 --> 00:18:08.876]  Care to join them?
[00:18:09.236 --> 00:18:13.761]  Technology is so advanced, it's classified.
[00:18:13.821 --> 00:18:13.881]  U.S.
[00:18:13.901 --> 00:18:16.064]  citizenship required.
[00:18:16.744 --> 00:18:18.767]  Kind of like sodium fluoride put in the water in 1947.
[00:18:20.996 --> 00:18:25.838]  And of course, under the guise of sodium fluoride, not just the deadly fluoride, the mercury, the lead, go read it!
[00:18:26.298 --> 00:18:28.138]  The heavy metals they put in your water every day.
[00:18:29.499 --> 00:18:32.300]  So secret it's classified, you murdering bastards, huh?
[00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:32.800]  It's funny?
[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:39.702]  It's funny what you've done to us, turning us into a nation of retarded savages, so we're more easily managed by you?
[00:18:41.803 --> 00:18:44.044]  You got a bunch of power-tripping young kids joining you?
[00:18:45.037 --> 00:18:48.238]  So you can kick all the older people out who aren't perfect.
[00:18:48.579 --> 00:18:51.760]  You got some very evil divisions, but you're going all evil, aren't you?
[00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:55.462]  Go ahead and play the next wicked ad airing on radio nationwide.
[00:18:57.082 --> 00:18:58.723]  A world of possibilities?
[00:18:58.883 --> 00:19:02.004]  A world of ambiguity and adventure?
[00:19:02.024 --> 00:19:09.848]  Are you a person of purpose, patriotism, professionalism, with curiosity and integrity?
[00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:13.092]  Are you ready to make a world of difference?
[00:19:13.972 --> 00:19:17.635]  Be a part of the National Clandestine Service at the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:19:18.215 --> 00:19:18.976]  The CIA.
[00:19:19.336 --> 00:19:20.537]  The work of a nation.
[00:19:20.557 --> 00:19:22.338]  The center of intelligence.
[00:19:26.721 --> 00:19:29.083]  Of course, they say it's illegal for the CIA to operate.
[00:19:29.123 --> 00:19:35.207]  They've run the Dallas Police Department, the Los Angeles Police Department, at least since the 60s.
[00:19:35.667 --> 00:19:37.809]  New York, Detroit, Chicago, Miami.
[00:19:40.419 --> 00:19:42.622]  Now they got their little federal emergency centers locally.
[00:19:43.183 --> 00:19:45.807]  They got hit teams of cops that kill people on the streets.
[00:19:46.227 --> 00:19:47.209]  Hit men in badges.
[00:19:47.229 --> 00:19:49.171]  They just pull up and execute you down on the side of the street.
[00:19:49.472 --> 00:19:50.053]  Nothing happens.
[00:19:51.074 --> 00:19:52.416]  They ship in the narcotics.
[00:19:54.238 --> 00:19:55.019]  Integrity.
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:55.841]  You may be sick.
[00:20:01.309 --> 00:20:07.719]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:20:08.079 --> 00:20:10.062]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:20:10.723 --> 00:20:11.745]  But who is the enemy?
[00:20:12.265 --> 00:20:12.786]  Bin Laden.
[00:20:13.066 --> 00:20:14.068]  This is his ammo.
[00:20:14.088 --> 00:20:15.410]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:16.852]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:20:17.412 --> 00:20:24.178]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:20:24.578 --> 00:20:25.019]  Some U.S.
[00:20:25.059 --> 00:20:30.823]  investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:20:31.404 --> 00:20:34.907]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:20:34.927 --> 00:20:45.175]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:20:45.395 --> 00:20:46.136]  Fabled Enemies.
[00:20:46.596 --> 00:20:57.782]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists!
[00:21:01.121 --> 00:21:02.102]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:02.182 --> 00:21:06.966]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:21:07.146 --> 00:21:14.953]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:21:15.213 --> 00:21:20.578]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:21:20.798 --> 00:21:27.764]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:21:28.064 --> 00:21:33.389]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:38.374]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:21:38.734 --> 00:21:46.321]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:21:46.661 --> 00:21:52.911]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:21:53.231 --> 00:21:54.273]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:54.293 --> 00:21:54.513]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:00.498 --> 00:22:01.919]  Honey, have you seen the remote?
[00:22:02.259 --> 00:22:04.061]  Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?
[00:22:04.481 --> 00:22:05.922]  I can't find my wallet!
[00:22:06.262 --> 00:22:06.963]  Sound familiar?
[00:22:07.103 --> 00:22:10.405]  Why not save time looking for lost things, and lose the stress instead?
[00:22:10.565 --> 00:22:15.689]  Introducing our patented Find One, Find All Key Finders, or FOFA XD for short.
[00:22:15.909 --> 00:22:21.833]  Once a FOFA key finder is attached to each of those easy to lose things, it can find and be found by all the rest.
[00:22:22.093 --> 00:22:28.398]  Use your wallet to find your keys, your keys to find the remote control, or any of them to find an uncharged or muted cell phone.
[00:22:28.558 --> 00:22:29.959]  The possibilities are endless.
[00:22:30.119 --> 00:22:35.862]  Fofa goes through walls, cushions, and laundry baskets up to 30 feet and projects a clear 90 plus decibel beep.
[00:22:36.443 --> 00:22:37.523]  Got the remote!
[00:22:38.304 --> 00:22:39.324]  Oh, my keys!
[00:22:39.925 --> 00:22:41.025]  There's my wallet!
[00:22:41.285 --> 00:22:48.710]  Order your Fofa today with batteries included along with a 30-day money-back guarantee by calling Find One Find All at 866-245-8670.
[00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:48.950]  That's 866-245-8670.
[00:23:00.276 --> 00:23:09.381]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[00:23:09.541 --> 00:23:17.585]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[00:23:17.725 --> 00:23:20.987]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[00:23:22.568 --> 00:23:36.376]  If you continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis, now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning, and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.
[00:23:36.616 --> 00:23:42.820]  FPP is used around the world, has numerous uses, and is now available to you from Freshwater Organics.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:50.824]  FPP strengthens skin, hair, and bones, lowers cholesterol, and is an excellent source of natural plant-based silica with 14 trace minerals.
[00:23:50.964 --> 00:23:51.965]  Order some today.
[00:23:52.205 --> 00:23:53.466]  Same tactics over and over again.
[00:23:53.626 --> 00:23:54.186]  Oh, superweapons.
[00:23:54.226 --> 00:23:54.607]  James Bond.
[00:23:54.627 --> 00:23:56.448]  Superweapons are what turn the tide in Iraq.
[00:24:17.592 --> 00:24:25.915]  Meanwhile, that's how they're selling the CIA for domestic operations, introducing the American people, their new domestic Stasi force.
[00:24:27.376 --> 00:24:32.198]  I mean, it's not enough to ship heroin and cocaine in and then put the people that use it in your prisons.
[00:24:33.198 --> 00:24:38.480]  I mean, you crooks, it's not enough to push Prozac and Ritalin and hundreds of other deadly drugs on our kids.
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:45.223]  It's not enough to grab a million, 400,000 children a year in the U.S., breaking up our families through eugenics.
[00:24:46.149 --> 00:24:48.090]  It's not enough to do all the things you do.
[00:24:48.731 --> 00:24:52.433]  Well, no, because now you've stolen $4 trillion from the Pentagon.
[00:24:53.133 --> 00:25:06.741]  Now you have leveraged the $54 trillion at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and loaned that out 10 times, 10 times, 10 times, 10, leveraging it through fractional reserve investment, leaving us holding the bag.
[00:25:07.641 --> 00:25:11.664]  And you know there's going to be nothing left now, except your offshore duchies.
[00:25:12.724 --> 00:25:13.785]  You've really done it.
[00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:16.932]  You've had total secrecy in power since 47.
[00:25:16.972 --> 00:25:20.795]  You've built underground bases all over the country and all over the world.
[00:25:21.435 --> 00:25:22.716]  You've got over 1,000 U.S.
[00:25:22.756 --> 00:25:24.978]  military bases in 160-plus nations.
[00:25:25.758 --> 00:25:27.260]  You've brainwashed our military.
[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:30.062]  You give them shots that kill them every day.
[00:25:30.522 --> 00:25:32.864]  You test bio and chemical weapons on the troops.
[00:25:33.164 --> 00:25:34.765]  You radiate foster children.
[00:25:35.706 --> 00:25:40.950]  You ship out a million-plus ampules of Factor VIII, giving everybody hepatitis and HIV.
[00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:42.231]  And it's all funny!
[00:25:42.511 --> 00:25:43.412]  It's all cute!
[00:25:45.234 --> 00:25:46.275]  It's so much fun!
[00:25:47.015 --> 00:26:05.044]  And the NSA, and Defense Intelligence, and the CIA, and the National Reconnaissance Office, you got all these pocket protector nerds, who really think they're fighting for America with the flag flapping outside, while you laugh at them, while your killers sit on top of them and go out and carry out your murders and your corruption all day.
[00:26:05.404 --> 00:26:11.407]  You take our best and brightest farm boys, you put them through special forces, then you sheep-dip them into black ops,
[00:26:12.532 --> 00:26:15.993]  You send the good ones off to die in no-win battles.
[00:26:16.233 --> 00:26:21.055]  You take the ones that are psychopaths and you recruit them into higher operations to run operations.
[00:26:22.836 --> 00:26:31.219]  And now the number one profession for our young women, our best and brightest, is being whores and hookers and porno.
[00:26:34.921 --> 00:26:38.662]  All forms of third-world diseases like cholera and leprosy and
[00:26:40.809 --> 00:26:55.680]  Oh, you name it, it's spreading everywhere, and drug-immune TB, and trichinosis, and chalmonella, and we're just overrun, everything bankrupt, corruption everywhere, the country's a bunch of slovenly hogs, know-it-all trash, myself included.
[00:26:56.841 --> 00:26:58.001]  God, we're evil!
[00:26:58.021 --> 00:27:01.444]  50-plus million aborted babies and counting.
[00:27:02.415 --> 00:27:17.446]  Both parties totally bought, mindless liberals thinking Barack Obama's going to save them, mindless idiot fake conservatives thinking open borders, gun-grabbing socialists, Keating 5, corrupt McCain, and Sarah Palin are going to save you.
[00:27:18.026 --> 00:27:19.387]  When they run, nothing to begin with.
[00:27:20.167 --> 00:27:21.969]  But if they did run something, my goodness!
[00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:29.714]  And during the children's hour on children's TV, they're running CIA recruitment ads everywhere.
[00:27:29.874 --> 00:27:30.755]  God help us!
[00:27:31.915 --> 00:27:33.396]  God help us!
[00:27:35.818 --> 00:27:36.678]  And there's no end.
[00:27:37.619 --> 00:27:46.885]  It's an absolute fact, the eugenicists know, that the cross-species GMO, gene-spliced organisms, are hurting every one of us that eat it.
[00:27:47.986 --> 00:27:49.547]  It's an absolute fact.
[00:27:49.587 --> 00:27:56.751]  They're spraying the atmosphere with all sorts of ozone-eating garbage, while they claim they're trying to save the Earth.
[00:27:57.032 --> 00:27:58.893]  I mean, we got psychos running things!
[00:28:00.442 --> 00:28:01.923]  And don't tell me that's not the case.
[00:28:03.544 --> 00:28:08.108]  Look at the Aztecs, look at the Romans, look at the Babylonians, look at the Chinese, look at every culture.
[00:28:08.148 --> 00:28:10.049]  They go power mad and nuts.
[00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:15.933]  And the elites always start dressing up like women and drinking blood and sacrificing people.
[00:28:16.033 --> 00:28:16.734]  I don't know why.
[00:28:17.374 --> 00:28:24.899]  They always start marrying their horses and smearing themselves with feces and just every other form of degeneracy.
[00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:29.763]  And you people out there don't know how serious it is!
[00:28:30.835 --> 00:28:37.019]  I happen to be every day facing it and really facing history and who these people are and what they do.
[00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:39.721]  You study this stuff hour after hour.
[00:28:39.761 --> 00:28:41.082]  It's all I can think about now.
[00:28:45.485 --> 00:28:46.946]  I am becoming the opposite of worldly.
[00:28:47.727 --> 00:28:51.369]  I look at a gorgeous, beautiful woman now on the street and I don't even have lust.
[00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:53.311]  Something I had years ago.
[00:28:53.711 --> 00:28:54.932]  You know, the stir that a man has.
[00:28:55.292 --> 00:28:57.854]  I admire them as God's creation but it's not even
[00:29:01.275 --> 00:29:03.035]  It's not even sexual anymore.
[00:29:03.156 --> 00:29:09.217]  All I think about is data and information and then how they operate and how they splice the propaganda and the fusion of it.
[00:29:09.237 --> 00:29:10.977]  And I can see their operation.
[00:29:11.198 --> 00:29:14.238]  I can read their own documents, but I can see the overlay, the mastery of it.
[00:29:15.779 --> 00:29:21.340]  I mean, these people are just burning geniuses, aflame with evil, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:23.701]  We have incredible enemies to deal with.
[00:29:24.081 --> 00:29:28.562]  And being fat slovenly, and by fat I mean psychologically, spiritually slovenly,
[00:29:29.481 --> 00:29:33.504]  You don't even know basic geography.
[00:29:33.965 --> 00:29:37.407]  How can you even begin to deal with this or face this?
[00:29:39.149 --> 00:29:43.112]  When you're dealing with pure evil, do you think they're propagandist ham-fisted?
[00:29:43.152 --> 00:29:43.672]  No, it's not.
[00:29:43.712 --> 00:29:45.874]  It's designed to just overwhelm you.
[00:29:46.654 --> 00:29:48.696]  God help us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:51.318 --> 00:29:52.299]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.319 --> 00:29:54.320]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.241 --> 00:29:57.943]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.727 --> 00:30:03.128]  It is a big idea.
[00:30:03.148 --> 00:30:05.269]  A New World Order.
[00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:10.853]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:30:10.873 --> 00:30:12.614]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[00:30:13.694 --> 00:30:15.976]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:30:16.496 --> 00:30:18.918]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:30:19.678 --> 00:30:27.003]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:30:30.009 --> 00:30:34.991]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:30:35.472 --> 00:30:38.933]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:30:38.973 --> 00:30:41.875]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:30:41.915 --> 00:30:43.035]  Most people have no idea.
[00:30:43.055 --> 00:30:43.816]  They're not after money.
[00:30:43.836 --> 00:30:44.896]  They have all the money they need.
[00:30:44.916 --> 00:30:45.937]  They're after power.
[00:30:46.117 --> 00:30:47.037]  That's what they're after these days.

[00:30:58.783 --> 00:31:00.023]  You have been warned.
[00:31:00.583 --> 00:31:03.644]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[00:31:04.024 --> 00:31:06.085]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[00:31:06.325 --> 00:31:09.346]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[00:31:09.626 --> 00:31:16.107]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[00:31:16.507 --> 00:31:18.628]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[00:31:19.128 --> 00:31:22.189]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[00:31:22.409 --> 00:31:27.051]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[00:31:27.211 --> 00:31:30.952]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[00:31:31.132 --> 00:31:32.673]  Travel less, meet online.

[00:31:46.698 --> 00:31:47.098]  I don't know.
[00:32:09.136 --> 00:32:14.938]  You've heard the commercials on Life Change T. The all-natural, clean your system and lose weight product.
[00:32:15.478 --> 00:32:16.898]  Well, maybe you don't believe.

[00:32:31.002 --> 00:32:32.123]  So what are you waiting for?

[00:32:52.382 --> 00:32:53.182]  Read up on us.
[00:32:53.703 --> 00:32:56.465]  You have nothing to lose, but wait.
[00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:12.713]  There's a famous case with the CPS in Florida where they kidnapped the man's children for literally no reason.
[00:33:14.433 --> 00:33:15.274]  Christian family.
[00:33:15.334 --> 00:33:18.195]  And then it even came out in court that the CPS lied.
[00:33:18.595 --> 00:33:19.616]  She went to jail for it.
[00:33:21.377 --> 00:33:25.278]  But he was put in a mental institution for complaining about it, basically.
[00:33:26.739 --> 00:33:27.759]  He'll be joining us.
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:29.620]  It's now insane, you see.
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:33.042]  Do not want this to happen to you.
[00:33:39.628 --> 00:33:51.834]  But I would like to hear from Special Forces, current and former, you know, they say in this CNN article, and Bob Woodward also said on 60 Minutes that, oh, Al-Qaeda, and Iran, of course, Al-Qaeda is Iran, it's not, but so what?
[00:33:51.854 --> 00:33:57.116]  You know, you've got a public that thinks, thinks the Middle East is in Antarctica.
[00:33:57.136 --> 00:34:08.662]  You know, he says Al-Qaeda knows all about the new weapons system, but of course the American people can't be told about any of this.
[00:34:10.979 --> 00:34:12.739]  Well, this is all hype.
[00:34:12.879 --> 00:34:16.080]  What worked was the White House plan.
[00:34:17.561 --> 00:34:25.322]  You see, you're told that the government plan is to create intelligent, dynamic, informed young people who have high test scores.
[00:34:26.082 --> 00:34:35.345]  But the official Department of Education plan is to break up the family, prepare the children for institutionalization in prisons or on welfare, or in the military.
[00:34:35.745 --> 00:34:37.005]  This is all stated in public.
[00:34:39.386 --> 00:34:43.928]  In books like Deliberate Dumbing Down by Charlotte Isserby, who was the head of Policy Department of Education.
[00:34:43.969 --> 00:34:46.950]  We sell her book, Deliberate Dumbing Down, at InfoWars.com, by the way.
[00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:51.272]  If you want the sources on that.
[00:34:53.093 --> 00:34:57.456]  But there are thousands of mainstream articles where they say we've got to eradicate the family, it's a disease.
[00:35:00.057 --> 00:35:03.799]  So the public face of the war on drugs is to stop drugs.
[00:35:04.306 --> 00:35:16.597]  Really, it's to ship more drugs in, but cut down on the competition, to streamline it so the US-based and British Central-based banks get to launder all the money and leverage it out ten times ten with the fractional reserve banking.
[00:35:16.837 --> 00:35:18.138]  So they leverage it over and over again.
[00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:28.608]  And to build up a police state, a grid, to legitimize spy forces, surveillance forces, domestic police forces, federal police forces, surveillance.
[00:35:30.015 --> 00:35:33.799]  The war on drugs is meant to create a monopoly on the narcotics and ship them to you.
[00:35:33.819 --> 00:35:49.694]  In fact, the CIA, in their own admission, was founded by the Skull and Bones, which was founded by the Opium Trust, the opium monopoly into this country, the Lucius Trust over there, the Russell Trust, shipping it in.
[00:35:49.714 --> 00:35:51.856]  So it was founded out of Yale.
[00:35:52.637 --> 00:35:54.979]  So it's always been about bringing narcotics in.
[00:35:58.286 --> 00:35:59.086]  So it's the same thing.
[00:35:59.306 --> 00:36:02.167]  You hear education, they want to help the kids.
[00:36:02.187 --> 00:36:06.068]  That means dumb them down, turn them into mindless consumers who can't talk.
[00:36:08.149 --> 00:36:12.670]  And who are the dumbest, most uneducated people in the world, the most ignorant.
[00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:15.651]  But the most arrogant and full of themselves at the same time.
[00:36:17.312 --> 00:36:18.232]  Same thing with the war.
[00:36:18.992 --> 00:36:21.873]  It's meant to be widened, it's meant to continue on forever.
[00:36:24.261 --> 00:36:27.724]  And they stated they would go into Iraq, break it in three parts, sow sectarian violence.
[00:36:27.744 --> 00:36:33.989]  That's why they disbanded the military, disbanded the civil service, fired all the police, so civil war would break out.
[00:36:34.649 --> 00:36:41.915]  But it didn't break out, so they handed out weapons to different factions, and then the United States, Israel, and England committed terrorist attacks.
[00:36:42.795 --> 00:36:44.157]  It would even come out in mainstream news.
[00:36:44.217 --> 00:36:45.337]  Yeah, U.S.
[00:36:45.377 --> 00:36:51.602]  Special Forces went in for eight hours and planted bombs in the Golden Mosque, and then blew it up and put it on the U.S.
[00:36:51.662 --> 00:36:52.263]  News that
[00:36:54.207 --> 00:36:58.271]  The Shiites had done it to the Sunnis.
[00:37:00.673 --> 00:37:02.634]  And then vice versa, blowing up other mosques.
[00:37:04.216 --> 00:37:07.799]  I mean, they even... Because an American doesn't even really know what a mosque is.
[00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:10.821]  Or what a Sunni or a Shiite is.
[00:37:10.861 --> 00:37:12.723]  And so, you can even have U.S.
[00:37:12.763 --> 00:37:14.665]  troops blow it up in front of everybody!
[00:37:14.845 --> 00:37:16.066]  It doesn't even matter!
[00:37:21.787 --> 00:37:24.649]  And then they start paying off the factions.
[00:37:24.889 --> 00:37:26.490]  They do let the police do their job.
[00:37:26.871 --> 00:37:29.813]  And so the death toll goes down by about half.
[00:37:31.014 --> 00:37:42.001]  And now the forced inoculations and the government brainwashing and the... Well, I mean, it's admitted the first major act was to ban statistic gathering by the Iraqi government.
[00:37:42.021 --> 00:37:44.683]  They're not allowed to report on cancer, rapes, murders.
[00:37:46.744 --> 00:37:50.267]  Because you got to do that so those numbers don't conflict with your fake numbers you're putting out.
[00:37:53.246 --> 00:37:59.472]  But the triple-checked, separate, Lanzik, British Medical Journal, U.S.
[00:37:59.512 --> 00:38:01.533]  Medical, all of them have gone over and looked.
[00:38:01.553 --> 00:38:02.034]  1.3 million dead.
[00:38:03.615 --> 00:38:05.016]  Things are going very well.
[00:38:05.917 --> 00:38:09.040]  That's 1.3 million in the last five and a half years of liberation.
[00:38:11.302 --> 00:38:18.048]  It, of course, was over a million and a half in the previous 14 years of liberation.
[00:38:24.381 --> 00:38:31.587]  And so now they give you your fake victory and say, oh, super weapons allowed this to happen.
[00:38:31.947 --> 00:38:37.532]  We can't tell you what this huge program is, as big as the Manhattan Project, but it's giant and it's secret.
[00:38:40.514 --> 00:38:47.500]  Are they getting ready to announce the space-based particle beams?
[00:38:49.341 --> 00:38:51.503]  But see, those don't have the power to shoot through
[00:38:55.188 --> 00:39:12.733]  The word we've got from James and other sources, James Weapons Quarterly and others, and former head of Star Wars, we've interviewed many times, and others, is you see, you can have a high-powered laser in space, but it's only going to have maybe one shot in it, for what it takes to shoot through concrete or shoot through walls.
[00:39:13.574 --> 00:39:24.397]  But if you're just firing out of some type of cyclotron, particles, or to boil it down, a radiation gun,
[00:39:27.822 --> 00:39:31.425]  Or if you're dropping from space, DU Sabos.
[00:39:32.826 --> 00:39:36.990]  You know, they've got them that weigh a hundred pounds, they've got them down to weigh just a few ounces.
[00:39:41.153 --> 00:39:51.762]  I mean, by 1980, they had squadrons of robotic DU, basically, gravity well, meteor gun, orbital craft.
[00:39:52.382 --> 00:39:54.104]  Can you imagine what they've got now?
[00:39:55.817 --> 00:39:57.058]  So is that what they're going to announce?
[00:39:57.078 --> 00:40:01.140]  Are they going to announce that we dropped little DU tubelets?
[00:40:02.461 --> 00:40:03.522]  Little DU tarps?
[00:40:03.582 --> 00:40:04.703]  I mean, just a couple ounces.
[00:40:05.883 --> 00:40:07.204]  Dropped out of a gravity well.
[00:40:07.244 --> 00:40:09.646]  Gets up to 30,000 miles an hour.
[00:40:10.967 --> 00:40:13.368]  And you drop that on a building, bye-bye.
[00:40:14.009 --> 00:40:16.110]  You drop that on a bunker, bye-bye.
[00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:21.934]  Of course, they got the big ones to get bunkers 500, 1,000 feet, 2,000 feet under the ground.
[00:40:26.286 --> 00:40:32.707]  These are full-spectrum dominance, global government decapitation weapons.
[00:40:32.787 --> 00:40:37.128]  They can kill every world leader in the world in five minutes.
[00:40:38.089 --> 00:40:40.109]  They can decapitate the entire Congress.
[00:40:40.209 --> 00:40:41.409]  Oh, you know that's the main target.
[00:40:41.649 --> 00:40:42.349]  It's not outside.
[00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:43.710]  That's secondary targets.
[00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:46.890]  They can decapitate the entire corporate leadership.
[00:40:47.811 --> 00:40:53.612]  And they brought them into that hangar up in Nebraska on the morning of 9-11
[00:40:55.319 --> 00:41:06.126]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of CEOs were called their quote for a secret meeting set up weeks before and were told in a hangar something secret in Nebraska.
[00:41:07.067 --> 00:41:07.467]  Remember that?
[00:41:07.487 --> 00:41:08.528]  It was in the Associated Press.
[00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:12.410]  What were they told?
[00:41:13.511 --> 00:41:16.132]  With Warren Buffett as the Master of Ceremonies.
[00:41:17.473 --> 00:41:18.934]  With the head of NORTHCOM there.
[00:41:20.415 --> 00:41:21.676]  While they ran the attacks.
[00:41:22.777 --> 00:41:24.738]  While they killed 3,000 of our own people.
[00:41:28.337 --> 00:41:31.999]  A meeting set for 8.30 in the morning, Eastern Time.
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:37.622]  Right when it all started, in a big hangar, with big TV screens.
[00:41:39.983 --> 00:41:46.706]  And boy, those CEOs, a lot of them who worked in the World Trade Center, who've been called out and away, wonder what they were let in on.
[00:41:51.328 --> 00:41:52.829]  You see what we're doing right now?
[00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:56.191]  All of you do exactly as you're told,
[00:41:57.509 --> 00:41:59.150]  We're now under continuity of government.
[00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:00.290]  It's in full force.
[00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:02.451]  This is martial law.
[00:42:03.051 --> 00:42:04.872]  You do what you're told, you'll be well taken care of.
[00:42:04.932 --> 00:42:06.492]  Most of you are fellow travelers with us.
[00:42:07.073 --> 00:42:08.233]  If you don't, you're dead.
[00:42:09.654 --> 00:42:10.754]  All of you are being watched.
[00:42:12.195 --> 00:42:13.195]  We know that's what was said.
[00:42:17.797 --> 00:42:21.518]  And then I think about the fact that I am the biggest person fighting this.
[00:42:22.439 --> 00:42:23.179]  I don't like that.
[00:42:27.924 --> 00:42:32.847]  You'd think I'd take a thrill out of all these big movie stars being fans of my radio show and TV show.
[00:42:33.567 --> 00:42:36.068]  All these big music icons.
[00:42:37.169 --> 00:42:38.410]  Talked to a huge one this morning.
[00:42:40.571 --> 00:42:41.431]  Ended up calling us.
[00:42:43.372 --> 00:42:44.913]  No, there's certainly no pleasure in that.
[00:42:45.233 --> 00:42:48.875]  There's pleasure in a job well done, I guess you could say, but it's not that well done.
[00:42:49.176 --> 00:42:50.276]  I don't do that good of a job.
[00:42:52.738 --> 00:42:53.278]  To know
[00:42:55.347 --> 00:42:56.848]  And I have this selfish side of me.
[00:42:56.908 --> 00:42:58.229]  It's a very small side of me.
[00:42:58.249 --> 00:43:06.794]  It's like a street light you pass in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night.
[00:43:06.814 --> 00:43:08.255]  You see it fading off in the distance.
[00:43:08.275 --> 00:43:10.196]  But I remember that could have been my life.
[00:43:10.236 --> 00:43:21.743]  That could have been me just working on a farm or working on a ranch or just being a businessman and not having this pressure on me.
[00:43:25.803 --> 00:43:26.943]  But that's a lie.
[00:43:27.003 --> 00:43:28.444]  There wouldn't have been safety in that.
[00:43:29.304 --> 00:43:30.784]  There wouldn't have been a real future in that.
[00:43:30.804 --> 00:43:34.605]  There would have just been living in a lie and going into this whole system.
[00:43:40.887 --> 00:43:46.388]  I mean, I've had to come to grips with just how influential this radio show is.
[00:43:49.989 --> 00:43:52.770]  The enormous influence we have
[00:43:54.468 --> 00:43:59.111]  And the responsibility of that is just staggering.
[00:44:01.033 --> 00:44:02.153]  I turn it all over to God.
[00:44:02.173 --> 00:44:07.477]  I turn it all over to God.
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:22.388]  But to understand what we're facing, to know what we're dealing with, in fact 95% of it plus is just all admitted in white papers, in Pentagon papers, in
[00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:25.591]  White papers put out by the Ministry of Defense in England.
[00:44:28.212 --> 00:44:29.473]  It's written about by futurists.
[00:44:29.513 --> 00:44:33.535]  It's written about by computer company owners.
[00:44:35.916 --> 00:44:37.297]  The highest level technocrats.
[00:44:41.039 --> 00:44:45.621]  They come right out and say, like Bill Joy that I talk about so much, but many others.
[00:44:46.361 --> 00:44:48.102]  Because he's the only one that's saying it's bad.
[00:44:48.852 --> 00:44:58.581]  I went to a big elite meeting of top computer company and IT experts, 200 of us, and all we talked about basically at the meeting was, will the majority be killed?
[00:44:59.502 --> 00:45:02.084]  With the new technologies we've got, are we going to let them in on it?
[00:45:02.464 --> 00:45:04.286]  People aren't needed anymore for labor.
[00:45:04.626 --> 00:45:06.508]  There's a lot of suppressed technology.
[00:45:07.348 --> 00:45:10.531]  The government, if you can call it that, has all these super weapons.
[00:45:12.753 --> 00:45:15.756]  And he's like, man, it's sad that they're talking about killing everybody.
[00:45:16.716 --> 00:45:19.118]  And he wrote a cover story for Wired Magazine.
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:25.024]  April issue, 2000, Why the Future Doesn't Need Us.
[00:45:25.084 --> 00:45:27.166]  And it was the same thing Theodore Kaczynski said.
[00:45:27.186 --> 00:45:28.827]  He quoted the Unabomber in it.
[00:45:29.368 --> 00:45:32.030]  You know, Theodore Kaczynski volunteered for the CIA in 1964.
[00:45:37.955 --> 00:45:40.797]  He was brought into high-level mind control projects.
[00:45:40.857 --> 00:45:43.639]  He was under mind control himself, carried out mind control programs.
[00:45:43.959 --> 00:45:44.740]  That's been in the L.A.
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:45.100]  Times.
[00:45:45.621 --> 00:46:05.475]  And then he was led into a higher level of the program, and it was explained to him that they were planning to do all this with the GMO, and planning to basically end the human species as it's known, with this new cybernetic evolution for the elite, the extermination of the vast majority, and he flipped out and moved out to a place in the middle of nowhere and started bombing the people involved.
[00:46:09.361 --> 00:46:13.502]  Really, the only thing a sane man would do if you were going to go with violence.
[00:46:15.663 --> 00:46:16.964]  Because he believed that was the only way.
[00:46:17.204 --> 00:46:20.785]  I don't agree with that, but I could see a sane man going with that.
[00:46:22.566 --> 00:46:23.946]  Theodore Kaczynski, a genius.
[00:46:26.507 --> 00:46:27.307]  Help us, God.
[00:46:27.347 --> 00:46:27.728]  Help us.
[00:46:28.648 --> 00:46:31.009]  This is all power talks about.
[00:46:31.029 --> 00:46:33.410]  This is all power deals with.
[00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:37.251]  This is all they discuss.
[00:46:40.845 --> 00:46:42.527]  Free energy has been invented.
[00:46:42.887 --> 00:46:49.453]  Humans have been cloned and spliced with hundreds of other species for at least 30 years.
[00:46:49.673 --> 00:46:51.074]  That's now declassified, by the way.
[00:46:51.374 --> 00:46:52.195]  Hidden in plain view.
[00:46:53.416 --> 00:46:55.238]  It's all being disclosed right now.
[00:46:56.374 --> 00:46:57.395]  And the public doesn't care.
[00:46:57.755 --> 00:47:00.857]  They're busy acting cool, trying to be radical and tough.
[00:47:01.438 --> 00:47:05.721]  Men are trying to, you know, run around acting radical and studly, unlike Steve McQueen.
[00:47:06.201 --> 00:47:13.006]  Women are completely insecure, under the mind control of Madison Avenue, believing they're fat and ugly, and obsessing on Weight Watchers.
[00:47:14.768 --> 00:47:16.789]  Everything's gyrating, falling apart.
[00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:22.313]  I mean, we are just destroyed.
[00:47:22.353 --> 00:47:22.974]  Destroto.
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:27.222]  And I look at the elite, and I'm like, God, what have you done?
[00:47:27.262 --> 00:47:29.503]  And they say, full-spectrum dominance.
[00:47:30.704 --> 00:47:39.650]  We are going to aggressively and cold-bloodedly have full-spectrum dominance for our families.
[00:47:41.851 --> 00:47:43.352]  There's only a few hundred families.
[00:47:43.372 --> 00:47:51.498]  And then we're gonna have a small servant class who's been promised they'll be part of it if they go along, and it is... You notice the last few James Bond movies?
[00:47:53.659 --> 00:48:09.383]  One is about genetic engineering and kidnapping people to get their genetics and basically organ harvesting, and another is about government-sponsored terror, corporate-sponsored terror, and another is... And Ian Fleming, of course, was with MI5 and MI6 when it was OSS, and this is how they throw it in your face.
[00:48:09.403 --> 00:48:18.566]  Remember Moonraker, where the big banker head, the richest guy in the world, teamed up with the other rich people and they're gonna kill everybody on Earth for a perfect eugenic society?
[00:48:21.423 --> 00:48:23.845]  That's what they're doing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:24.925 --> 00:48:26.406]  We don't get to be part of the future.
[00:48:26.686 --> 00:48:27.887]  We don't get to go forward.
[00:48:28.167 --> 00:48:31.289]  And they've even told us that this is what they're going to do to us.
[00:48:35.072 --> 00:48:38.114]  And the elites don't have control of their laboratories and their GMO.
[00:48:38.614 --> 00:48:41.316]  They're very reckless, and they say we enjoy being reckless.
[00:48:41.696 --> 00:48:49.081]  Yes, we know the Hadron Heavy Reactor
[00:48:49.949 --> 00:48:56.552]  But they're going to be cooling down for the next five years and accelerating the streams, what, four times stronger than it's ever been?
[00:48:56.632 --> 00:48:57.272]  Seven times?
[00:48:58.233 --> 00:48:59.093]  And then on and on and on.
[00:49:00.534 --> 00:49:05.916]  Crossing the streams, running them into each other, and admitting, yes, it could destroy the Earth, but it probably won't.
[00:49:10.458 --> 00:49:14.000]  Meanwhile, they're recruiting young people to be spies.
[00:49:16.178 --> 00:49:17.178]  Well, this song's for you.
[00:49:17.199 --> 00:49:24.782]  We're going to come back, get into what these superweapons are, and then we'll take calls from special forces and people who want to chime in on this.
[00:49:25.122 --> 00:49:26.143]  We'll be right back.
[00:49:26.203 --> 00:49:26.803]  Stay with us.
[00:49:49.074 --> 00:50:15.255]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:50:23.749 --> 00:50:24.190]  I think so.
[00:50:52.547 --> 00:51:04.636]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[00:51:04.696 --> 00:51:07.838]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:51:08.198 --> 00:51:10.180]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:12.001]  But who is the enemy?
[00:51:12.382 --> 00:51:12.962]  Bin Laden.
[00:51:13.162 --> 00:51:14.163]  This is his ammo.
[00:51:14.183 --> 00:51:15.544]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:51:15.564 --> 00:51:17.005]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:51:17.525 --> 00:51:24.270]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:51:24.690 --> 00:51:25.130]  Some U.S.
[00:51:25.170 --> 00:51:30.934]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:51:31.514 --> 00:51:34.997]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:51:35.017 --> 00:51:45.283]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:51:45.523 --> 00:51:46.244]  Fabled Enemies.
[00:51:46.724 --> 00:51:54.016]  Get the DVD at Infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:51:54.477 --> 00:51:57.883]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists!
[00:52:01.374 --> 00:52:05.177]  Do you have doubts about the stability of the dollar or your own financial future?
[00:52:05.577 --> 00:52:10.321]  Is a dismal growth rate or rapid inflation affecting the bottom line of your retirement savings account?
[00:52:10.521 --> 00:52:15.625]  Do you worry about uncontrollable economic events which could suddenly wipe out some or all of your hard-earned savings?
[00:52:15.805 --> 00:52:17.807]  You can turn adversity into opportunity.
[00:52:17.987 --> 00:52:26.430]  Individual retirement accounts and most 401Ks, 403Bs, SEPs and other retirement plans can be rolled over into self-directed accounts using gold and silver.
[00:52:26.491 --> 00:52:31.112]  There are definitely some do's and don'ts with this rollover process and that's where Midas Resources comes in.
[00:52:31.132 --> 00:52:33.173]  Call us at 1-866-323-5665 and we can help you with this process.
[00:52:37.675 --> 00:52:42.880]  History has shown that metals will maintain your buying power even if other financial assets are failing.
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:47.624]  It's not a question of if you'll need precious metals in your portfolio, it's a question of when.
[00:52:48.085 --> 00:52:53.130]  So whether you're planning for an economic rainy day or a Category 5 hurricane, the solution is the same.
[00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:54.211]  Call us today at 1-866-323-5665.

[00:53:01.797 --> 00:53:05.259]  Attention, this is an extremely urgent self-reliant news bulletin.
[00:53:05.619 --> 00:53:12.062]  If you have ever wanted to produce your own cheaper-than-dirt survival food, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:53:12.742 --> 00:53:13.563]  Here is why.
[00:53:14.183 --> 00:53:24.108]  This network has just learned of a new video course that reveals the secrets of how to safely prepare and store all types of survival foods in an event of social unrest and food shortages here in the U.S.
[00:53:24.628 --> 00:53:27.010]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[00:53:27.370 --> 00:53:29.451]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[00:53:29.491 --> 00:53:29.991]  this fall?
[00:53:30.472 --> 00:53:30.992]  Don't wait.
[00:53:31.352 --> 00:53:35.034]  Learn the food shortage skills that can keep you and your family alive in a crisis.
[00:53:35.335 --> 00:53:38.176]  Get the details at FoodShortageUSA.com.
[00:53:38.677 --> 00:53:41.478]  That's FoodShortageUSA.com.

[00:53:54.967 --> 00:53:55.267]  Act now!
[00:54:28.815 --> 00:54:31.638]  Coming up in the next segment, next hour, we'll be taking your phone calls.
[00:54:31.678 --> 00:54:32.959]  What are these super weapons?
[00:54:32.999 --> 00:54:43.248]  What is this program as big as the Manhattan Project that they used to win the war in Iraq?
[00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:52.074]  It's called thousand-dollar bills on big pallets.
[00:54:52.514 --> 00:54:55.817]  It was called contriving the Civil War from the beginning so you can turn it off.
[00:54:56.257 --> 00:55:01.100]  But they want to advertise their gadgets and seduce more people into getting behind the war.
[00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:02.321]  It's a little mind trick.
[00:55:04.483 --> 00:55:06.464]  Now they say they never went to Iraq for WMDs.
[00:55:06.484 --> 00:55:07.705]  They went to bring democracy.
[00:55:08.166 --> 00:55:09.406]  The Iraqis say, get out.
[00:55:09.466 --> 00:55:12.208]  They say, oh, well, we came there so they could say, get out.
[00:55:14.350 --> 00:55:15.671]  Lie after lie after lie.
[00:55:17.651 --> 00:55:18.271]  Then the U.N.
[00:55:18.291 --> 00:55:26.536]  can come in later as their savior, as they're now preparing for I-4 and the rest of them to come in, as Bush announces 15,000 U.S.
[00:55:26.576 --> 00:55:27.337]  troop pullback.
[00:55:29.878 --> 00:55:30.759]  Build down.
[00:55:30.779 --> 00:55:34.361]  The military now can tell the truth about nothing, so it's a build down.
[00:55:35.301 --> 00:55:36.882]  I'm sorry, a build down.
[00:55:37.323 --> 00:55:38.603]  Just everything is doublespeak.
[00:55:38.864 --> 00:55:44.047]  As soon as Budweiser isn't brewed in the U.S., they call it American Ale on all the bottles.
[00:55:44.087 --> 00:55:46.348]  See, it's just real simple, but it's just everywhere.
[00:55:47.977 --> 00:55:49.038]  It's total deception.
[00:55:50.739 --> 00:56:03.688]  Now, why do they want to convert the Air Force over almost entirely, unless you're talking about troop transport, to robotically controlled and robotically programmed, where humans aren't even piloting it from remote locations from the ground?
[00:56:06.250 --> 00:56:10.553]  Why do they want ground fighting robots, ground remote-controlled tanks?
[00:56:11.654 --> 00:56:12.915]  Why are they deploying these?
[00:56:13.355 --> 00:56:16.037]  Why are they testing them in the laboratory that's Iraq and Afghanistan?
[00:56:18.522 --> 00:56:22.265]  Because they don't want to have to worry about soldiers.
[00:56:22.285 --> 00:56:24.006]  They don't want to have to have a draft.
[00:56:24.607 --> 00:56:25.548]  The military says this.
[00:56:25.588 --> 00:56:26.809]  They're just going to get rid of soldiers.
[00:56:27.329 --> 00:56:37.637]  And soldiers will be technicians in the rear with the gear who are just maintaining the robotic forces.
[00:56:38.318 --> 00:56:39.859]  And yes, it's 2008, folks.
[00:56:43.062 --> 00:56:44.463]  This is all happening right now.
[00:56:45.063 --> 00:56:46.725]  The new fighter aircraft orders.
[00:56:47.737 --> 00:56:51.039]  More than half of them already are pilotless drones.
[00:56:53.361 --> 00:56:54.241]  The Reaper.
[00:56:54.741 --> 00:56:55.602]  The Predator.
[00:56:57.103 --> 00:57:05.468]  See, that takes the human decision out of the equation and allows the elites to master program things and allows very small, tiny groups to have control.
[00:57:06.529 --> 00:57:13.153]  It also allows, in the future, artificially intelligent or malfunctioning computer systems
[00:57:14.258 --> 00:57:15.439]  To attack themselves.
[00:57:15.999 --> 00:57:17.920]  And the elite is fully aware of this.
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:21.782]  The elite could also launch an attack and then blame it on the computers.
[00:57:22.202 --> 00:57:26.844]  Or claim terrorists hacked in to the computers and did it themselves.
[00:57:27.384 --> 00:57:29.986]  There's endless mischief that this will bring.
[00:57:33.447 --> 00:57:34.868]  So what are the secret weapons?
[00:57:34.968 --> 00:57:37.089]  Smart dust and nanotechnology?
[00:57:38.050 --> 00:57:39.030]  Robo-rats?
[00:57:40.671 --> 00:57:41.531]  Particle beams?
[00:57:41.731 --> 00:57:42.772]  Radiation beams?
[00:57:44.901 --> 00:57:55.327]  C-130s with radiation cannons, radiation guns, see-through wall technology, infrared, ground-penetrating radar, sonar.
[00:57:56.748 --> 00:57:59.429]  Same stuff they're putting in airports to scan your naked body and record you.
[00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:02.931]  Remember, NORTHCOM's over the U.S.
[00:58:02.971 --> 00:58:06.613]  now, and Congress has been told they're under a state of emergency since 9-11.
[00:58:08.514 --> 00:58:12.156]  COG is in place, and they can't even see PDD-51.
[00:58:16.938 --> 00:58:18.059]  You understand how this works?
[00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:25.623]  You got a bunch of fat-ass generals sitting up there smoking their cigars, going to the Watergate every night, banging your daughters.
[00:58:26.003 --> 00:58:27.004]  Excuse my French, folks.
[00:58:27.044 --> 00:58:28.784]  I'm using your daughters up.
[00:58:29.485 --> 00:58:37.089]  Huge whorehouses everywhere, and they're just little low-level puppets for the bankers and the technocratic scientists, the eggheads on top, running it all.
[00:58:37.869 --> 00:58:38.630]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:38.650 --> 00:58:39.150]  Stay with us.
[00:58:39.170 --> 00:58:43.632]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:51.522 --> 00:58:53.583]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:58:53.703 --> 00:58:56.064]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:58:56.084 --> 00:58:58.304]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:58:58.344 --> 00:58:59.905]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:58:59.925 --> 00:59:01.525]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:59:01.545 --> 00:59:04.466]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:59:04.506 --> 00:59:08.227]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFO?
[00:59:17.808 --> 00:59:23.851]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:59:23.951 --> 00:59:25.111]  An inside job?
[00:59:26.472 --> 00:59:30.314]  How dare you?
[00:59:30.574 --> 00:59:33.975]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:59:34.135 --> 00:59:36.736]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:59:42.299 --> 00:59:43.280]  Truth Rises.

[00:59:48.443 --> 00:59:50.945]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:59:54.087 --> 00:59:56.028]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.468 --> 00:59:59.250]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.718 --> 01:00:06.359]  Big Brother.
[01:00:07.019 --> 01:00:08.100]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:09.901]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.562 --> 01:00:11.382]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.123 --> 01:00:13.003]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.444 --> 01:00:17.307]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.887 --> 01:00:21.990]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.671 --> 01:00:26.973]  Okay, every few weeks we have an on-topic call-in.
[01:00:27.034 --> 01:00:32.538]  That means we do screen your calls, only to find out that you're on topic.
[01:00:32.598 --> 01:00:34.399]  You can agree, you can disagree,
[01:00:37.193 --> 01:00:39.635]  Call yourself and don't use non-King's English.
[01:00:42.296 --> 01:00:58.928]  We got Bob Woodward, the government's spook, running around, posing as a trendy liberal, telling us that the war is basically wonderful and that the military won with super-secret weapon development that is bigger than the Manhattan Project and is just wonderful.
[01:01:00.188 --> 01:01:01.749]  They love to say that, these huge programs.
[01:01:02.130 --> 01:01:06.793]  There's a program bigger than the Manhattan Project, quote, to kill the web and force you on the internet, too.
[01:01:07.743 --> 01:01:13.646]  That's what the Pentagon said about six months ago when MIT announced, with pleasure, because they are scared of us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:14.126 --> 01:01:19.928]  They're scared we're reaching their technicians, their people inside the system, who are compartmentalized, nothing ever made sense to them.
[01:01:20.368 --> 01:01:22.049]  They listen to this show, everything makes sense.
[01:01:22.449 --> 01:01:24.770]  We give you all the footnotes, where it came from, who said it.
[01:01:25.450 --> 01:01:27.551]  Then you find out, it's all right in your face.
[01:01:28.072 --> 01:01:31.393]  I'm somebody that stepped back from the elephant and went, you know, I was like,
[01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:33.941]  It's got gray skin, it's got hair, it smells.
[01:01:34.561 --> 01:01:36.382]  And I went on, let me just step back from this.
[01:01:36.602 --> 01:01:37.102]  Whoa!
[01:01:37.202 --> 01:01:37.842]  It's an elephant!
[01:01:40.003 --> 01:01:41.363]  It's like the emperor's new clothes.
[01:01:41.403 --> 01:01:43.604]  Three-year-old steps forward and says the emperor's naked.
[01:01:44.804 --> 01:01:47.885]  I don't claim to even be the sharpest knife in the drawer.
[01:01:48.886 --> 01:01:51.026]  Or that my elevator goes all the way to the top every day.
[01:01:52.147 --> 01:01:54.308]  But see, people's elevators do, quote, go to the top.
[01:01:54.948 --> 01:01:56.648]  What is sane versus insane?
[01:01:57.048 --> 01:01:59.509]  Sane means you believe vaccines are the law to take.
[01:01:59.909 --> 01:02:01.510]  There's no law you gotta take them, but it doesn't matter.
[01:02:02.681 --> 01:02:03.162]  Sane!
[01:02:03.302 --> 01:02:07.005]  Most Americans believe that their quote refund check is free money.
[01:02:07.325 --> 01:02:07.985]  They've done polls.
[01:02:10.447 --> 01:02:12.629]  Some polls over 70% believe that's free money.
[01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:20.655]  Other polls show that over 70% believe federal aid to the states is free money that you didn't pay taxes for.
[01:02:20.675 --> 01:02:25.719]  It is sane to believe that 9-11 happened in 2003.
[01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:27.601]  They've had national polls.
[01:02:28.041 --> 01:02:29.602]  Most Americans believe 9-11 happened in 2003.
[01:02:31.429 --> 01:02:32.210]  Don't go pull that up.
[01:02:33.050 --> 01:02:36.292]  I think the headline was most Americans don't know what year 9-11 happened.
[01:02:36.372 --> 01:02:38.793]  It's sane to believe sodium fluoride is good for you.
[01:02:39.553 --> 01:02:43.075]  It is sane to believe that corn syrup is good for you.
[01:02:43.735 --> 01:02:45.716]  It is sane to believe that aspartame is good for you.
[01:02:45.856 --> 01:02:49.578]  It's sane to believe cameras on street corners with wide open borders is sane.
[01:02:50.939 --> 01:02:53.540]  It is sane to think being lied to is a good thing.
[01:02:56.682 --> 01:02:58.203]  More to have without due process.
[01:02:58.623 --> 01:03:00.804]  A million four hundred thousand children snatched every year.
[01:03:04.199 --> 01:03:06.099]  So, uh, we are now going to take your call.
[01:03:06.159 --> 01:03:09.520]  Specifically, what are these incredible new super weapons?
[01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:11.120]  Again, they lure everyone in.
[01:03:11.661 --> 01:03:12.541]  Oh, it's like MacGyver.
[01:03:12.561 --> 01:03:13.421]  It's like James Bond.
[01:03:13.481 --> 01:03:15.001]  Oh, I guess the war's so cool.
[01:03:15.041 --> 01:03:17.282]  These... Oh, the government's invincible.
[01:03:17.342 --> 01:03:19.342]  It's all about flaunting the power.
[01:03:19.502 --> 01:03:20.382]  Ah, we rule you.
[01:03:20.602 --> 01:03:22.983]  The technocracy has full spectrum domination.
[01:03:24.203 --> 01:03:25.123]  James in Canada.
[01:03:25.143 --> 01:03:25.744]  You're on the air.
[01:03:26.364 --> 01:03:27.104]  Yes, hello, Alex.
[01:03:27.584 --> 01:03:27.704]  Hi.
[01:03:28.616 --> 01:03:31.677]  Alex, you are royalty, man, worthiest of the most respect.
[01:03:32.297 --> 01:03:38.799]  But I want to say that it's time that humanity concentrates on making a refuge from the captivity of the demonic cultures, you know?
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:54.285]  Something like a system that would allow us to provide healing services, and through voluntary service, to procure faculties and residence for within, like the Vatican, where we could live within our own and be independent of the evil government.
[01:03:54.405 --> 01:03:54.985]  What do you think of that?
[01:03:55.726 --> 01:03:57.909]  Well, I mean, I'm getting these calls every day about the Vatican.
[01:03:58.470 --> 01:04:06.824]  You're talking about people who hate the New World Order, who love liberty, need to have our own organization, or our own, you know, declare our own independent state.
[01:04:08.502 --> 01:04:09.463]  Well, here's the problem.
[01:04:09.543 --> 01:04:12.726]  That is a top-down structure, pyramidal structure.
[01:04:12.746 --> 01:04:14.268]  It's easy to cut the head off.
[01:04:14.748 --> 01:04:23.537]  What's invincible is lone wolf resistance in the info war, unlocking minds to where people at Colorado Springs, Colorado, figure out what they're part of.
[01:04:23.998 --> 01:04:26.581]  Or where people in the think tanks figure out what they're part of.
[01:04:27.562 --> 01:04:31.506]  Or where, you know, individuals involved in all of this
[01:04:32.384 --> 01:04:34.286]  You see, that's how we're going to turn this around.
[01:04:34.306 --> 01:04:35.406]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:04:36.427 --> 01:04:38.008]  And we're all royalty in God's eyes.
[01:04:38.389 --> 01:04:39.209]  We're God's children.
[01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:41.471]  You know, part of his kingdom.
[01:04:41.491 --> 01:04:47.115]  But the point is, thank you, James, but that was not about what these secret weapons are.
[01:04:47.415 --> 01:04:49.917]  I want it on topic or I'm going to basically cut you off, folks.
[01:04:51.078 --> 01:04:55.101]  And I know... You see, the problem is, I know we know what it is.
[01:04:55.181 --> 01:04:59.444]  There's just so many new secret weapons that have been brought forward that we don't know which one it is.
[01:05:00.024 --> 01:05:00.545]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:07.962]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:05:08.322 --> 01:05:10.283]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:05:10.963 --> 01:05:11.983]  But who is the enemy?
[01:05:12.504 --> 01:05:13.024]  Bin Laden.
[01:05:13.304 --> 01:05:14.284]  This is his ammo.
[01:05:14.304 --> 01:05:15.665]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:05:15.685 --> 01:05:17.125]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:05:17.645 --> 01:05:24.408]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:05:24.808 --> 01:05:25.249]  Some U.S.
[01:05:25.289 --> 01:05:31.051]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:05:31.651 --> 01:05:35.133]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:05:35.153 --> 01:05:45.417]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:05:45.638 --> 01:05:46.358]  Fabled Enemies.
[01:05:46.838 --> 01:05:54.153]  Get the DVD at Infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:05:54.614 --> 01:05:58.021]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists!
[01:06:01.317 --> 01:06:04.381]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[01:06:04.742 --> 01:06:06.824]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[01:06:07.065 --> 01:06:10.068]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[01:06:10.369 --> 01:06:16.857]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized the contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[01:06:17.258 --> 01:06:19.361]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[01:06:19.861 --> 01:06:22.923]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[01:06:23.143 --> 01:06:27.765]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[01:06:27.945 --> 01:06:31.647]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[01:06:31.867 --> 01:06:33.408]  Travel less, meet online.
[01:06:33.508 --> 01:06:35.989]  Go to Webex.com and try Webex free.
[01:06:36.169 --> 01:06:41.772]  Just click the radiographic and enter promo code 500 to get a free trial and a free webcam too.
[01:06:42.092 --> 01:06:45.614]  Remember that code, 500, to qualify for the free webcam.
[01:06:45.854 --> 01:06:47.335]  Webex, now part of Cisco.
[01:06:47.495 --> 01:06:47.815]  I don't know.
[01:07:01.579 --> 01:07:04.982]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:07:05.102 --> 01:07:10.327]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:07:10.507 --> 01:07:15.291]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:07:15.672 --> 01:07:26.802]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:07:27.182 --> 01:07:32.727]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:07:32.967 --> 01:07:39.033]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:07:39.213 --> 01:07:39.853]  What about you?
[01:07:40.254 --> 01:07:42.175]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.
[01:07:42.195 --> 01:07:44.858]  $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[01:08:02.665 --> 01:08:08.728]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:09.308 --> 01:08:12.349]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:13.429 --> 01:08:14.870]  That's right, we are occupied.
[01:08:17.043 --> 01:08:18.944]  I think so.
[01:08:39.747 --> 01:08:42.769]  We're very individualistic, so it's hard to get us together to begin with.
[01:08:42.849 --> 01:08:46.291]  Plus, anything centralized is very easy to infiltrate.
[01:08:46.811 --> 01:08:50.213]  Anything that has one leader or a couple leaders can be decapitated.
[01:08:51.534 --> 01:08:52.294]  Let me explain something.
[01:08:54.496 --> 01:09:00.659]  Nothing short of nuclear weapons would be used on Congress if they ever tried to actually overthrow the military-industrial complex.
[01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:06.683]  If the people marched on Washington, this isn't me saying this, this is in white papers.
[01:09:06.983 --> 01:09:08.364]  British Ministry of Defense, others.
[01:09:09.128 --> 01:09:11.170]  Neutron bombs will be used.
[01:09:12.591 --> 01:09:13.812]  Well, then Alex, hang it up.
[01:09:13.873 --> 01:09:14.253]  It's over.
[01:09:14.693 --> 01:09:15.654]  Roll over and die.
[01:09:15.814 --> 01:09:16.195]  No.
[01:09:17.876 --> 01:09:19.458]  We can take over the small towns.
[01:09:19.678 --> 01:09:21.960]  We can take over the cities with the information.
[01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:23.301]  Person to person.
[01:09:24.302 --> 01:09:28.366]  We can fully discredit the mainstream media as a false reality projecting matrix.
[01:09:29.287 --> 01:09:32.810]  We can expose the universities as fronts for money laundering operations.
[01:09:33.010 --> 01:09:33.611]  That's what they are.
[01:09:34.412 --> 01:09:36.713]  Cities are fronts for money laundering.
[01:09:37.253 --> 01:09:40.453]  A tiny fraction of the tax money you pay ever went for streets or cops.
[01:09:40.813 --> 01:09:48.215]  Most of it went into international investments, which were then leveraged and leveraged and leveraged militarily to buy up and get more raw assets.
[01:09:48.915 --> 01:09:52.796]  Everything's going corrupt now, folks.
[01:09:53.516 --> 01:09:54.696]  Oil companies aren't paying people.
[01:09:54.716 --> 01:09:55.876]  The oil leases their money.
[01:09:57.737 --> 01:09:58.997]  Businesses are defaulting.
[01:09:59.057 --> 01:10:00.317]  Corruption, stealing.
[01:10:00.657 --> 01:10:03.038]  The elites are themselves scared by what they built.
[01:10:03.118 --> 01:10:03.958]  They're all running to
[01:10:04.696 --> 01:10:11.057]  You know, jungle fortresses and island fortresses and private security firms are exploding.
[01:10:11.497 --> 01:10:21.900]  They want national ID and world ID and tracker systems and biometric tracking systems to protect themselves from the crimes they've committed and how they've destroyed society.
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:31.401]  See, they had to dumb us down to take control of us, but a lot of the policy thinkers and makers, policy developers, have said that they've destroyed us too badly.
[01:10:31.922 --> 01:10:33.682]  That they've damaged the public too much.
[01:10:37.862 --> 01:10:51.867]  So that it may be hard to even carry out their master plan of exterminating the majority out of us, because their own minions are so stupid, and they're so corrupt and backstabbing and evil, that it's hard for them even to work cohesively or not be cowardly.
[01:10:52.888 --> 01:10:54.168]  I mean, these SWAT teams are cowardly.
[01:10:54.669 --> 01:10:55.869]  These militaries are cowardly.
[01:10:56.689 --> 01:10:58.310]  These intelligence operatives are cowardly.
[01:10:58.894 --> 01:11:05.296]  Now they got a lot of farm-raised Christian good ol' boys who aren't stupid, but are in such a tightly controlled box.
[01:11:05.536 --> 01:11:08.176]  They're out murdering, running hits, shipping drugs in.
[01:11:08.536 --> 01:11:09.537]  But it's all for Jesus.
[01:11:09.577 --> 01:11:10.677]  It's all to fight Communists.
[01:11:10.737 --> 01:11:11.997]  It's all to fight Muslims.
[01:11:12.417 --> 01:11:14.518]  We gotta be more evil than them to defend America.
[01:11:14.738 --> 01:11:17.499]  People just don't know the real world, how tough it is out there.
[01:11:17.819 --> 01:11:22.880]  Yeah, I've committed a lot of murders and a lot of hits, and even kidnapped people's kids, you know, to get jobs done.
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:25.921]  But it's for the greater good, and that's why I pray to Jesus every night.
[01:11:28.101 --> 01:11:33.384]  They fly them to Israel and, you're a good Christian, you understand, oh, you're a part of it.
[01:11:33.404 --> 01:11:35.425]  They fly them to England, oh, you're a part of it.
[01:11:37.726 --> 01:11:40.347]  Give them tour, show them what they want, mind control them.
[01:11:41.427 --> 01:11:44.669]  Huge brigades of our farm-raised men are just killers.
[01:11:46.330 --> 01:11:54.474]  And then there's the psychopaths above them that laugh at them and go to the bars and, you know, go to their retreats and just laugh at the idiots below them.
[01:11:54.554 --> 01:11:57.095]  It's so funny what schmucks you are, they say.
[01:12:02.802 --> 01:12:05.564]  And that's how it all works, a compartmentalized system of evil.
[01:12:05.884 --> 01:12:14.750]  But even those good ol' boys, you know, the higher-up, former special ops guys, they don't really know that the fluoride's being put in their water.
[01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:16.371]  They don't know about the cancer viruses.
[01:12:17.112 --> 01:12:18.733]  And but see, they're starting to go read.
[01:12:18.773 --> 01:12:19.293]  They hear me.
[01:12:19.813 --> 01:12:21.875]  And they go and they look and they go, oh, that's really true.
[01:12:21.895 --> 01:12:30.261]  I wonder why my buddy Sam, hypothetical story, I wonder why my buddy Sam did die at 41 of that cancer.
[01:12:32.555 --> 01:12:39.501]  And yeah, you know, in my million-dollar house, they start thinking, just on my block, a couple little kids have died of cancer in the last couple years.
[01:12:39.541 --> 01:12:40.662]  I mean, go look at the statistics.
[01:12:42.423 --> 01:12:44.064]  My God, we are being soft-killed.
[01:12:44.104 --> 01:12:45.305]  Well, I wouldn't let in on that.
[01:12:45.646 --> 01:12:47.727]  And you're not going to be letting in on that, buddy.
[01:12:48.268 --> 01:12:58.136]  You think the egghead controllers, the master chess players, want you in the underground bunkers when they release the death plague, the super plague, the white death?
[01:13:00.037 --> 01:13:00.858]  Do you think they want
[01:13:03.314 --> 01:13:06.017]  Cully, Predator killers like you around?
[01:13:06.497 --> 01:13:12.443]  When they're done, they're going to be ninnying around in their little white togas, worshipping Lucifer.
[01:13:12.683 --> 01:13:14.805]  We're not going to be here, jackass.
[01:13:16.767 --> 01:13:18.488]  Not me, not you, not anybody else.
[01:13:19.209 --> 01:13:20.190]  This isn't a game.
[01:13:20.510 --> 01:13:21.491]  This isn't a joke.
[01:13:21.832 --> 01:13:25.315]  I'm not risking my life to tell you the absolute truth for nothing.
[01:13:30.572 --> 01:13:31.872]  And they've got all those little subgroups.
[01:13:31.892 --> 01:13:34.873]  They've got little hardcore Baptist New World Order killers.
[01:13:34.893 --> 01:13:38.774]  And they've got their little hardcore sequestered Mormon killers in intelligence.
[01:13:38.794 --> 01:13:40.714]  And they've got their little Zionist killers in there.
[01:13:40.734 --> 01:13:45.856]  And they've got their little Buddhist Earth First, Earth First Pale Horse Death Brigades.
[01:13:46.536 --> 01:13:49.116]  And they've got all their little weird New Agey groups.
[01:13:49.136 --> 01:13:52.597]  I mean, I've had the former head of the army on here to tell you about that.
[01:13:54.458 --> 01:13:55.158]  It's real!
[01:13:57.555 --> 01:13:59.477]  I played a high-level Mason yesterday.
[01:13:59.737 --> 01:14:02.179]  Walk right to the camera and say, Sweet Lucifer.
[01:14:02.539 --> 01:14:03.079]  Cue that up.
[01:14:04.781 --> 01:14:07.763]  Got one of the big head Shriners going into a meeting of Shriners.
[01:14:08.163 --> 01:14:09.184]  The Christian's talking to him.
[01:14:09.224 --> 01:14:10.025]  He talks about sweet.
[01:14:10.045 --> 01:14:17.911]  You know, I said I'd get to Matt and Ted and Rick and Ray, but just play the Lucifer clip again for folks.
[01:14:19.611 --> 01:14:21.171]  Lucifer, what is your problem?
[01:14:21.412 --> 01:14:22.152]  Just that, sir.
[01:14:23.472 --> 01:14:24.772]  I'm a Christian, sir.
[01:14:24.953 --> 01:14:27.413]  I'm pure and virtuous and wholesome and innocent.
[01:14:27.813 --> 01:14:29.954]  How can you say anything right about me?
[01:14:30.274 --> 01:14:31.534]  Sir, you need to be born again.
[01:14:32.235 --> 01:14:33.075]  I am born again.
[01:14:33.415 --> 01:14:35.155]  Did you just say that you're Lucifer?
[01:14:35.295 --> 01:14:35.996]  I am Lucifer.
[01:14:36.056 --> 01:14:37.756]  Okay, define Lucifer for me.
[01:14:37.796 --> 01:14:42.237]  Pure, virtuous, wholesome, innocent individual that's out to help people.
[01:14:42.437 --> 01:14:42.998]  It was.
[01:14:43.218 --> 01:14:44.598]  Lucifer is?
[01:14:44.638 --> 01:14:45.338]  It started over again.
[01:14:45.358 --> 01:14:46.699]  Do you hear that guy's voice?
[01:14:46.859 --> 01:14:48.159]  That resonance?
[01:14:49.125 --> 01:14:53.790]  I mean, that's someone who believes, whether it's real or not, that he has the power of Lucifer seething.
[01:14:54.130 --> 01:14:57.113]  That's the 32nd degree, that's the secret rites above that.
[01:14:57.553 --> 01:14:59.415]  He is having Lucifer enter your body.
[01:14:59.435 --> 01:15:01.337]  You become Lucifer.
[01:15:02.538 --> 01:15:07.843]  Now listen to him, I'm pure, I'm virtuous, he's seething with it.
[01:15:07.903 --> 01:15:08.264]  Go ahead.
[01:15:09.325 --> 01:15:10.226]  What is your problem?
[01:15:10.446 --> 01:15:11.087]  Just that, sir.
[01:15:12.472 --> 01:15:13.733]  I'm a Christian, sir.
[01:15:13.893 --> 01:15:16.375]  I'm pure and virtuous and wholesome and innocent.
[01:15:16.755 --> 01:15:18.976]  How can you say anything right about me?
[01:15:19.237 --> 01:15:20.517]  Sir, you need to be born again.
[01:15:21.218 --> 01:15:22.359]  I am born again.
[01:15:22.379 --> 01:15:24.120]  Did you just say that you're Lucifer?
[01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:24.980]  I am Lucifer.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:26.341]  Okay, define Lucifer for me.
[01:15:26.761 --> 01:15:31.505]  Pure, virtuous, wholesome, innocent individual that's out to help people.
[01:15:31.525 --> 01:15:32.385]  Lucifer is?
[01:15:32.505 --> 01:15:33.206]  Yeah.
[01:15:33.326 --> 01:15:33.906]  Say that again.
[01:15:33.966 --> 01:15:35.207]  Lucifer is a pure,
[01:15:36.562 --> 01:15:37.082]  Virtuous!
[01:15:37.283 --> 01:15:38.003]  Virtuous!
[01:15:38.243 --> 01:15:39.884]  Now, see the Lucifer that God created?
[01:15:40.305 --> 01:15:41.065]  That's the same one.
[01:15:41.225 --> 01:15:42.086]  Oh, man, this is great.
[01:15:42.126 --> 01:15:43.367]  I'm going to put this on the internet.
[01:15:43.647 --> 01:15:45.549]  Oh, God bless you, brother.
[01:15:45.769 --> 01:15:50.572]  Because that's exactly what the Shriners and Masons teach, is that Lucifer, Lucifer is light.
[01:15:50.612 --> 01:15:50.652]  No.
[01:15:50.712 --> 01:15:51.813]  And you're confirming it.
[01:15:51.873 --> 01:15:53.034]  What about those hospitals?
[01:15:53.675 --> 01:15:54.775]  You know what, sir?
[01:15:55.276 --> 01:16:00.019]  Jesus said, many will say to me on that day, Lord, Lord, we did not do these good deeds in your name.
[01:16:00.239 --> 01:16:02.441]  And you'll say, away from me, you workers of iniquity.
[01:16:02.581 --> 01:16:03.261]  I never knew you.
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:09.363]  Jesus said in Matthew Chapter 5, Mercy.
[01:16:09.944 --> 01:16:11.545]  Now, that's hard to believe.
[01:16:11.565 --> 01:16:13.566]  So, you're a Christian and you don't know that.
[01:16:14.226 --> 01:16:16.748]  No, I really am.
[01:16:16.808 --> 01:16:18.329]  No, I really am.
[01:16:18.349 --> 01:16:24.793]  That's exactly what Jesus would talk to the people possessed with devils.
[01:16:24.813 --> 01:16:26.234]  They would say, Mercy.
[01:16:26.895 --> 01:16:27.655]  Mercy.
[01:16:28.115 --> 01:16:29.276]  He reads that scripture to them.
[01:16:29.776 --> 01:16:30.497]  Mercy.
[01:16:32.225 --> 01:16:38.208]  I mean, how could somebody who just believes they're worshipping Lucifer say exactly what devils said 2,000 years ago?
[01:16:39.928 --> 01:16:43.930]  I mean, how would he just speak that exactly as they did in the Old Testament and the New Testament?
[01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:45.390]  Mercy!
[01:16:45.511 --> 01:16:46.611]  Mercy!
[01:16:47.751 --> 01:16:49.312]  Oh, give me mercy!
[01:16:49.852 --> 01:16:50.673]  I mean, did you hear that?
[01:16:50.693 --> 01:16:56.175]  Alright, I said I want to know what the superweapons are, and I'm making everybody wait on hold.
[01:16:57.375 --> 01:17:00.497]  Let's go ahead and talk to Matt in the UK.
[01:17:00.597 --> 01:17:01.217]  Go ahead, Matt.
[01:17:02.153 --> 01:17:02.836]  Hi, I, uh...
[01:17:03.911 --> 01:17:06.593]  Hi Alex, pleased to meet you and thank you for letting me on your show.
[01:17:07.233 --> 01:17:21.203]  The first question is, I've got a radio show in the UK, which is w.boroughfm.co.uk, the talk show, and I'd like to thank you almost for waking me up, and my family, on all the issues of what we've talked about.
[01:17:21.884 --> 01:17:28.668]  I've watched your station, listened to your radio station, for quite a while now, and I've called many times.
[01:17:28.688 --> 01:17:32.111]  But also, the question I would like to ask,
[01:17:33.071 --> 01:17:37.353]  Is the CIA in the UK?
[01:17:37.973 --> 01:17:39.733]  Are they got operatives in the UK?
[01:17:39.793 --> 01:17:40.394]  Are you kidding?
[01:17:40.414 --> 01:17:43.695]  They've got the biggest substation in the world in London.
[01:17:44.335 --> 01:17:52.818]  Giant, the main antennas, the biggest array of them, cluster of them, is belting central England for the National Security Agency.
[01:17:53.795 --> 01:18:09.945]  Right, because the question I'm asking is, people can email me, which is PropagandaBin at GoogleMail.com if they want to email, which I'd like you guys to do, because I'm always informed of your show, and it's actually welcome.
[01:18:09.965 --> 01:18:19.271]  Sir, I'm glad we woke you up, and I'm glad you've got your own radio show, but I want you to tell me, because see, I want special forces to call in.
[01:18:19.651 --> 01:18:21.913]  I want them to be able to get in on the line, and I appreciate your call, man.
[01:18:25.109 --> 01:18:30.554]  I want people to call in with what they believe the super-weapons are that they claim turn the tide in Iraq.
[01:18:33.196 --> 01:18:33.636]  Okay?
[01:18:34.597 --> 01:18:38.260]  Now, we've given out a list of the super-weapons, the high-tech weapons they're using.
[01:18:39.361 --> 01:18:44.245]  I don't know which one Woodward says is going to come out in the future and it's going to be as big as the Manhattan Project.
[01:18:45.366 --> 01:18:51.251]  Probably space-based particle beams, because they're ready to break a bunch of international treaties by announcing that.
[01:18:51.791 --> 01:18:53.813]  Or DU Sabo's drop from space,
[01:18:54.774 --> 01:18:56.776]  Or robo-rats, robo-bugs.
[01:18:57.317 --> 01:19:00.880]  I know they've got to wear a roach climbing in your ear when you're asleep and blows the side of your head off.
[01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:03.242]  They've got see-through wall technology.
[01:19:04.003 --> 01:19:05.544]  There's a whole cocktail of things.
[01:19:08.487 --> 01:19:11.670]  They've got satellites that can watch your biometric walk from space.
[01:19:12.311 --> 01:19:15.434]  They can keep track of people even in different disguises.
[01:19:16.756 --> 01:19:21.940]  I would think that it would be a cocktail of technologies, but I'm specifically wanting the military to call in and tell us.
[01:19:22.241 --> 01:19:29.066]  Because they say on CNN and 60 Minutes that Al-Qaeda knows and it's not really a secret, but they're not going to tell us.
[01:19:29.106 --> 01:19:31.848]  Well, I know about all the technologies.
[01:19:32.809 --> 01:19:35.851]  I just don't know which one they're going to claim it is, or they're going to say a cocktail.
[01:19:35.871 --> 01:19:36.552]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:19:36.612 --> 01:19:38.253]  I'm going to shut up.
[01:19:38.273 --> 01:19:43.978]  We're going to talk to Ted, Rick, Ray, Peter, and others, but I'm telling you.
[01:19:45.146 --> 01:19:53.059]  Folks, if you don't at least tell me what you think the superweapon is or if you know, I'm gonna hang up on you, okay?
[01:19:53.741 --> 01:19:57.968]  Every few weeks, maybe once a month, I ask for this and people never, never do that.
[01:20:01.603 --> 01:20:05.224]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.

[01:22:01.766 --> 01:22:05.108]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[01:22:05.548 --> 01:22:10.171]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[01:22:10.591 --> 01:22:19.357]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S., though the people of the U.S., where their numbers and influence are strongest,
[01:22:19.557 --> 01:22:19.897]  I think?
[01:22:38.814 --> 01:22:39.355]  Thanks for watching!
[01:23:03.015 --> 01:23:04.916]  We live in a world of vanishing privacy.
[01:23:05.176 --> 01:23:12.657]  The added threat of invisible radio waves sending out personal information to anyone willing to receive them makes our privacy as citizens even less secure.
[01:23:12.678 --> 01:23:16.498]  The RFID tags and ID cards have been proven to be not secure.
[01:23:16.739 --> 01:23:20.479]  Thieves are able to read information stored on these tags to steal your identity.

[01:23:30.482 --> 01:23:34.524]  Many countries, including the U.S., have begun to institute RFID in passports.
[01:23:34.764 --> 01:23:35.684]  Why take a chance?
[01:23:35.924 --> 01:23:37.825]  This is your personal information.
[01:23:37.965 --> 01:23:38.706]  Protect yourself.
[01:23:38.926 --> 01:23:47.689]  ProSpy.com also offers a complete selection of spy gear and security equipment, including bug detectors, camera finders, countermeasure equipment, and night vision gear.

[01:24:01.496 --> 01:24:01.917]  We're good to go.
[01:24:17.719 --> 01:24:25.807]  Operating in total secrecy since 1947, can you imagine the entitledness, the arrogance, the corruption, what is bread?
[01:24:25.827 --> 01:24:32.394]  Imagine if you for 50-something years let your employees do whatever they wanted and gave them unlimited funds.
[01:24:32.574 --> 01:24:36.298]  I mean, you'd show up, none of them would be there.
[01:24:36.398 --> 01:24:39.061]  None of them, they'd be out, you know, fishing or whatever.
[01:24:39.101 --> 01:24:41.063]  Well, it's hundreds of times worse than that.
[01:24:41.795 --> 01:24:42.876]  They'd steal you blind.
[01:24:43.496 --> 01:24:49.459]  And that's what's happened, and we've been taught to be a nation of thumb-sucking, pathetic cattle, that by any lie we're fed.
[01:24:49.499 --> 01:24:52.001]  It's time to stop that, because it's getting too dangerous.
[01:24:52.021 --> 01:24:55.523]  Because these people are eugenicists, and they want to kill the majority of us.
[01:24:57.143 --> 01:24:58.724]  That's what always happens in history.
[01:24:58.764 --> 01:25:00.625]  It's happening again, but this time they can really do it.
[01:25:01.086 --> 01:25:02.747]  Let's see the next callers on topic.
[01:25:03.307 --> 01:25:07.829]  What is the government's super-weapon that they're saying they're using in Iraq?
[01:25:07.909 --> 01:25:08.830]  Ted in Los Angeles.
[01:25:09.739 --> 01:25:10.660]  Alex, how are you doing, buddy?
[01:25:10.700 --> 01:25:14.562]  Look, I'm not with the military, but I've been trying to talk to you for a couple weeks about superweapons.
[01:25:15.083 --> 01:25:15.803]  It's very similar.
[01:25:16.203 --> 01:25:17.064]  Look, I live in L.A.
[01:25:17.104 --> 01:25:23.208]  I live on a hill, and for the last year and a half since I woke up, you haven't woken up, I've noticed a heavy chem spray.
[01:25:23.268 --> 01:25:24.349]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[01:25:24.729 --> 01:25:26.430]  And now, out of the blue, it's stopped.
[01:25:26.891 --> 01:25:28.952]  They spent hundreds of millions of dollars to do that.
[01:25:29.292 --> 01:25:30.153]  Why did they stop?
[01:25:30.453 --> 01:25:37.598]  Does that make a city a target for a potential neutron bomb when they stopped spending hundreds of millions of dollars to chem spray?
[01:25:37.718 --> 01:25:39.359]  Well, when I said neutron bomb, sir,
[01:25:40.119 --> 01:25:44.981]  Those are used if the Congress or the people ever try to set the United States up again.
[01:25:45.001 --> 01:25:46.902]  I mean, it's been going for a long time.
[01:25:47.442 --> 01:25:48.863]  That's a decapitation weapon.
[01:25:48.883 --> 01:25:51.084]  That's why I'm saying we can't just go take the Capitol over.
[01:25:51.564 --> 01:25:59.007]  We have to peacefully educate people about the shadow government, stop complying with everything, to then have a real debate with the elite.
[01:25:59.387 --> 01:26:08.691]  But if we don't admit with a real atmosphere what we're really dealing with, and our enemy's real philosophy, then we never have any chance of defeating it, as long as we are perpetually children.
[01:26:09.389 --> 01:26:17.011]  What would be the motivation to stop Pinspring out of nowhere, just stop it, when they spend so much money to initiate the process, and just to quit?
[01:26:17.171 --> 01:26:18.592]  I'm very curious about that.
[01:26:19.172 --> 01:26:20.672]  Well, most of that is classified.
[01:26:20.892 --> 01:26:21.712]  Or was that a question?
[01:26:22.513 --> 01:26:23.273]  Yeah, that was a question.
[01:26:23.313 --> 01:26:23.593]  Go ahead.
[01:26:24.613 --> 01:26:26.134]  Well, number one, I appreciate your call.
[01:26:26.254 --> 01:26:27.974]  It isn't really exactly on topic.
[01:26:28.954 --> 01:26:30.675]  I don't think we've ever had a caller on topic.
[01:26:32.435 --> 01:26:33.596]  I mean, I'm asking the listeners.
[01:26:34.036 --> 01:26:37.917]  I know we have a lot of military people, former military people, listening.
[01:26:38.897 --> 01:26:43.139]  And, uh, they're admitting that it's no secret to the troops, no secret to the foreigners.
[01:26:44.420 --> 01:26:48.122]  And so, I mean, I know it's microwave guns, radiation guns.
[01:26:48.943 --> 01:26:52.865]  They have got, they've been caught using microwave weapons in Fallujah.
[01:26:55.867 --> 01:26:56.607]  Nerve gas.
[01:26:57.207 --> 01:26:59.809]  But that's not some new super technology, nerve gas.
[01:27:00.609 --> 01:27:02.790]  Does particle beams fit into some new super weapon?
[01:27:03.211 --> 01:27:05.432]  Bigger than the, as big as the Manhattan Project?
[01:27:07.839 --> 01:27:09.980]  Your question was, why would they stop chemtrails in your area?
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.301]  The answer is, it's a secret program.
[01:27:11.341 --> 01:27:11.922]  We don't know, sir.
[01:27:12.282 --> 01:27:20.727]  They just admit that there is a large Department of Energy program since the mid-90s when the ice trails stopped lasting a minute and started lasting five hours.
[01:27:21.267 --> 01:27:22.508]  Because they're not ice trails anymore.
[01:27:22.768 --> 01:27:23.729]  When the plains are spring.
[01:27:24.189 --> 01:27:26.090]  They admit they're spring for weather modification.
[01:27:26.430 --> 01:27:27.611]  That's only one part of the program.
[01:27:28.031 --> 01:27:28.472]  I don't know!
[01:27:29.112 --> 01:27:29.332]  Okay?
[01:27:29.352 --> 01:27:30.673]  I don't know why they're stopping in your area.
[01:27:31.353 --> 01:27:32.234]  I don't have a crystal ball.
[01:27:32.694 --> 01:27:33.935]  Rick in California, go ahead.
[01:27:35.916 --> 01:27:36.316]  Go ahead.
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:08.621]  But we're being like with the microwave weapon.
[01:28:09.402 --> 01:28:16.206]  Well, I mean, we know that they're showing us 1960s technology, these particle beams that shoot down rockets, shoot down missiles.
[01:28:16.686 --> 01:28:19.728]  And yes, they've got all sorts of new beams, new rays.
[01:28:20.689 --> 01:28:21.269]  We know that.
[01:28:21.309 --> 01:28:22.410]  And they're certainly using them.
[01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:24.351]  We know they used them in Desert Storm One.
[01:28:25.131 --> 01:28:27.193]  I mean, there would be people where the Jeep wasn't burned.
[01:28:27.233 --> 01:28:30.895]  Everybody's laying there like disintegrated from attack from Mars or something.
[01:28:31.997 --> 01:28:43.936]  Well, right, but there's a gentleman, a former Army colonel, who's got a website that talks about some of the... He's a physicist that's been in the alternative energy or the...
[01:28:44.676 --> 01:28:46.016]  We're good to go.
[01:29:10.203 --> 01:29:16.088]  And it seems that there is some evidence from photographs in Iraq that they're using a smaller version of that right now.
[01:29:16.328 --> 01:29:21.492]  Well, if they're getting ready to announce it, we know they're using radiation guns, is what they are.
[01:29:22.733 --> 01:29:25.075]  We know they're using radiation guns, and it's a laboratory.
[01:29:26.556 --> 01:29:30.379]  You know, the Iraqis are slated for extermination, and that's what's going on.
[01:29:31.060 --> 01:29:31.840]  I appreciate your call.
[01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:33.822]  So, will it be directed-energy weapons?
[01:29:34.983 --> 01:29:38.466]  I mean, we know they have them.
[01:29:39.392 --> 01:29:50.715]  Particle beams, lasers, things like that, but compared to these cyclotrons that then add it to a light beam, it's powerful stuff.
[01:29:51.915 --> 01:29:54.916]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.836 --> 01:29:58.517]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.770 --> 01:30:08.173]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:30:08.533 --> 01:30:10.534]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:30:11.174 --> 01:30:12.195]  But who is the enemy?
[01:30:12.715 --> 01:30:13.255]  Bin Laden.
[01:30:13.515 --> 01:30:14.336]  This is his ammo.
[01:30:14.396 --> 01:30:15.876]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:30:15.896 --> 01:30:17.497]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:30:17.877 --> 01:30:24.621]  Disabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:30:25.041 --> 01:30:25.481]  Some U.S.
[01:30:25.521 --> 01:30:31.264]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:30:31.864 --> 01:30:35.306]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:30:35.746 --> 01:30:38.428]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:31:03.135 --> 01:31:06.218]  You know, I know exactly what you're thinking when it comes to this economy.
[01:31:06.238 --> 01:31:07.579]  The banks are crashing.
[01:31:07.699 --> 01:31:09.200]  The stock market's a mess.
[01:31:09.301 --> 01:31:10.842]  There's the mortgage crisis.
[01:31:10.962 --> 01:31:12.784]  There's the lending crisis.
[01:31:12.904 --> 01:31:17.328]  There is the food and gasoline prices through the ceiling crisis.
[01:31:17.588 --> 01:31:19.129]  And we are paralyzed a little bit.
[01:31:19.149 --> 01:31:20.931]  We don't know exactly how to respond to it.
[01:31:21.111 --> 01:31:21.912]  I don't know what to say.
[01:31:22.132 --> 01:31:22.692]  What can you do?
[01:31:22.712 --> 01:31:23.533]  Do what you can do.
[01:31:23.573 --> 01:31:24.133]  That's what you do.
[01:31:24.173 --> 01:31:25.114]  You do what you can do.
[01:31:25.334 --> 01:31:26.996]  What I can do is I can put some food away.
[01:31:27.096 --> 01:31:28.677]  I know there's a global food shortage.
[01:31:28.877 --> 01:31:29.377]  I can read it.
[01:31:29.437 --> 01:31:32.418]  I can go to efoodsdirect.com, read hundreds of articles about this.
[01:31:32.599 --> 01:31:36.820]  I can go up on the Google website and Google food shortage and see the world's a mess.
[01:31:36.981 --> 01:31:37.341]  I know it.
[01:31:37.401 --> 01:31:37.761]  You know it.
[01:31:37.821 --> 01:31:38.561]  Look at the prices.
[01:31:38.581 --> 01:31:39.242]  Look where they're headed.
[01:31:39.282 --> 01:31:39.862]  Be prepared.
[01:31:39.922 --> 01:31:40.542]  Take care of yourself.
[01:31:40.602 --> 01:31:46.565]  You owe your family some security, some sense of self-being, a little bit of self-reliance is a good idea right now.

[01:32:10.681 --> 01:32:18.844]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[01:33:11.833 --> 01:33:13.453]  I want to hear from the military.
[01:33:16.574 --> 01:33:21.595]  We've seen these antenna arrays on the backs of armored vehicles mounted on roofs.
[01:33:24.056 --> 01:33:26.236]  They look like microwave-based weapons.
[01:33:29.137 --> 01:33:32.378]  You know, the answer here... Let me just finish up.
[01:33:33.618 --> 01:33:38.239]  I'm gonna go back to your calls in a moment, but I want to just recap what we're talking about for listeners that just joined us.
[01:33:39.631 --> 01:33:45.172]  Secret killing program is key in Iraq, Woodward says.
[01:33:45.572 --> 01:33:50.633]  The dramatic drop in violence in Iraq is due, in large part, to a secret program the U.S.
[01:33:50.673 --> 01:33:52.413]  military has used to kill terrorists.
[01:33:52.973 --> 01:33:56.334]  Now again, anybody that resists them, anybody that doesn't want millions of Iraqis to die as a terrorist.
[01:33:56.934 --> 01:34:06.916]  According to a new book by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Bob Woodward, the program which Woodward compares to the World War II-era Manhattan Project that developed the atomic bomb must remain secret for now.
[01:34:07.660 --> 01:34:09.321]  Or, would it get people killed?
[01:34:09.842 --> 01:34:11.743]  Woodward said, on Larry King's line.
[01:34:12.704 --> 01:34:18.228]  It is a wonderful example of American ingenuity, solving a problem in war, as we often have, Woodward said.
[01:34:18.588 --> 01:34:24.092]  Now, it goes on down here to say, though, that the insurgents all know what it is, and that it's not really a secret.
[01:34:27.394 --> 01:34:36.921]  Well, the space planes, uh, with the SABO DU rounds they can drop in the gravity well, particle beams, microwave guns,
[01:34:37.885 --> 01:34:41.107]  Basically directed energy weapons is the overall name.
[01:34:43.548 --> 01:34:45.829]  They've got ground penetrating radar to look through your walls.
[01:34:46.849 --> 01:34:55.794]  Woodward told Larry King that while there is debate over how much credit the new secret operation should get for the drop in violence, he concluded it accounts for a good portion.
[01:34:56.494 --> 01:34:59.075]  I would somewhat compare it to the Manhattan Project in World War II.
[01:34:59.456 --> 01:35:00.016]  He said it's
[01:35:01.710 --> 01:35:04.913]  A skis club right down in a matter of months cutting the violence in half.
[01:35:05.253 --> 01:35:10.337]  This isn't going to happen with a bunch of joint security stations or the search.
[01:35:11.298 --> 01:35:27.371]  So the big lie here is the main reason was they disbanded the military, disbanded the police, had it break down, had special forces stage terror attacks, blow up mosques, get different sides killing each other using their religious fervor and the mindlessness of it all to fight with each other.
[01:35:28.934 --> 01:35:31.275]  And then they stopped doing that when the surge started.
[01:35:31.576 --> 01:35:34.297]  And then openly started paying everybody off not to kill each other.
[01:35:35.237 --> 01:35:47.784]  That's why they've got White House officials and people in the Army saying, well, no, there's a secret program and it's part of it, but the biggest thing is the surge and they mean the payoff.
[01:35:49.225 --> 01:35:54.268]  While he would not reveal the details, Woodward said the terrorists who had been targeted were already aware of the capabilities.
[01:35:57.054 --> 01:36:00.457]  The enemy has a heads up because they've been getting wiped out.
[01:36:00.477 --> 01:36:02.739]  A lot of them have been killed, he said.
[01:36:02.859 --> 01:36:03.800]  It's not news to them.
[01:36:04.461 --> 01:36:20.635]  If you were a member of Al-Qaeda, Al-Qaeda, C-I-A-D-A, or the resistance, see now we're talking about real people, or the resistance, or some extremist militia, people that don't want to be slaves, you would be wise to get your rear end out of town, Woodward said.
[01:36:20.815 --> 01:36:22.457]  It is very dangerous.
[01:36:25.703 --> 01:36:29.986]  No, they can just fly over with a C-130 with microwaves and fry everybody in the whole town.
[01:36:31.526 --> 01:36:32.307]  And that's what they did.
[01:36:33.308 --> 01:36:36.609]  The blood starts running out your eyes, you just cook right there, it's so sick.
[01:36:37.850 --> 01:36:42.293]  And all the good ol' boys are good, murdered all of them, kill them!
[01:36:43.594 --> 01:36:48.637]  Don't worry, they're gonna kill your dollar, your bank account, your future, they're gonna pump you full of deadly soft kill, too, punk.
[01:36:49.437 --> 01:36:50.918]  You think you're part of the system, you're not.
[01:36:55.774 --> 01:36:56.895]  So that's why they're so arrogant.
[01:36:56.915 --> 01:36:58.876]  That's why they're launching sneak attacks on the Russians.
[01:36:59.857 --> 01:37:02.919]  That's why they don't care if you know all this stuff now.
[01:37:02.959 --> 01:37:03.760]  It's just like, hey!
[01:37:04.761 --> 01:37:08.543]  We can decapitate every world leader in five minutes with the space planes in orbit.
[01:37:10.685 --> 01:37:12.846]  With their meteor guns, firing DU.
[01:37:15.068 --> 01:37:15.328]  Hey!
[01:37:15.829 --> 01:37:17.970]  We got bio-plagues of a clever person on Earth.
[01:37:18.210 --> 01:37:20.552]  We got neutron bombs ready to take out every government.
[01:37:20.892 --> 01:37:21.673]  Including ours.
[01:37:22.273 --> 01:37:24.735]  Sit down, shut up, and roll your sleeve up!
[01:37:25.908 --> 01:37:32.714]  But they are going to have to physically come in and make us roll our sleeves up and take the shots.
[01:37:32.734 --> 01:37:38.039]  They're going to have to get us to acquiesce and pay them taxes and fund them and go along with all of it.
[01:37:39.059 --> 01:37:44.104]  And they're going to have to make sure we can't reach out to the minds of the military and police and show them what's going on.
[01:37:44.124 --> 01:37:50.850]  I mean, they may have full spectrum dominance and have all these secret weapons, but people don't believe anything they say now.
[01:37:51.250 --> 01:37:53.632]  You got maybe 10% of the population that will still buy their crap.
[01:37:58.473 --> 01:38:04.296]  And that's why they're giving you a woman and a black guy to try to suck you back into the process to believe the puppets actually run something.
[01:38:04.316 --> 01:38:06.577]  Alright, I'm going to plug sponsors and I'm going back to your calls.
[01:38:07.118 --> 01:38:07.878]  And I'm going to move quick.
[01:38:07.918 --> 01:38:14.621]  I want to hear specifically at 1-800-259-9231 what you think or know the superweapons are.
[01:38:16.582 --> 01:38:19.264]  Or if you don't want to call in, if you've been in the military, and tell us what it is.
[01:38:19.284 --> 01:38:21.645]  Of course, they're not even telling you it's a superweapon.
[01:38:21.945 --> 01:38:25.027]  They're just telling you it's part of a larger package of high-tech weapons.
[01:38:26.010 --> 01:38:30.093]  I mean, hell, they were using some type of direct energy weapon in Panama.
[01:38:30.133 --> 01:38:30.733]  That's admitted.
[01:38:31.533 --> 01:38:33.535]  I mean, you can just point me in the direction of a movie.
[01:38:33.595 --> 01:38:35.876]  Point me in the direction of something that's been admitted.
[01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:44.962]  They got drones that fly around face scanning people and killing them.
[01:38:45.302 --> 01:38:46.323]  That's been declassified.
[01:38:46.823 --> 01:38:48.484]  Most of this has been declassified.
[01:38:49.338 --> 01:38:53.499]  You know the CIA classifies thousands of news articles every year as classified?
[01:38:53.859 --> 01:38:56.940]  They take it, grab it, snip it out and put it in their files as classified.
[01:38:56.980 --> 01:38:57.680]  It's ridiculous.
[01:38:57.700 --> 01:39:00.601]  I want to tell you about a few sponsors that were going to your calls.
[01:39:01.361 --> 01:39:04.001]  E-Foods Direct, folks, is our biggest sponsor.
[01:39:04.502 --> 01:39:05.582]  Next to Minus Resources.
[01:39:06.602 --> 01:39:07.562]  And they're just great people.
[01:39:08.842 --> 01:39:15.144]  With all the uncertainty, the talk of war with Russia, the talk of war with Iran, the economy, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae,
[01:39:16.324 --> 01:39:18.846]  Going into government receivership in the Ponzi scheme.
[01:39:19.367 --> 01:39:23.310]  With all the things that are happening, it's smart to have a year's supply of food for everybody in your family.
[01:39:23.670 --> 01:39:25.732]  It's very affordable, very inexpensive.
[01:39:26.012 --> 01:39:29.015]  They've got month supplies, two-month supplies, boogie-pack supplies.
[01:39:29.415 --> 01:39:33.759]  Really is high-quality, hydrated and freeze-dried food.
[01:39:34.319 --> 01:39:34.940]  Great folks.
[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:36.601]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:39:37.182 --> 01:39:38.203]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:39:38.223 --> 01:39:42.006]  Big banners up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:39:42.907 --> 01:39:44.328]  Don't end up like the Superdome people.
[01:39:44.910 --> 01:39:48.251]  Having to go turn their guns in, you know, to go in and get rape ganged.
[01:39:48.551 --> 01:39:50.431]  That was they thought we were going to get food, and of course they didn't.
[01:39:50.471 --> 01:39:52.311]  It was all laboratory tests to see what would happen.
[01:39:52.331 --> 01:39:59.353]  800-409-5633, 800-409-5633, efoodsdirect.com.
[01:39:59.433 --> 01:40:03.793]  Again, big banners up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:40:04.113 --> 01:40:06.514]  You'll never have to stand in the bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:40:06.574 --> 01:40:08.594]  That is their motto.
[01:40:10.375 --> 01:40:12.915]  And another one of our fine sponsors is a cola blue.
[01:40:13.633 --> 01:40:14.373]  A Cola Blue.
[01:40:14.533 --> 01:40:16.114]  They just got more of their unit in, by the way.
[01:40:16.134 --> 01:40:17.575]  They sold out because of this show.
[01:40:18.995 --> 01:40:19.976]  It's a great system.
[01:40:20.076 --> 01:40:21.917]  Atmospheric water generator for the home.
[01:40:22.557 --> 01:40:26.839]  Pays for itself in one year if you buy your water from the store.
[01:40:27.339 --> 01:40:28.920]  Pure, clean water without the fluoride.
[01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:31.081]  Unlimited water from the humidity in the air.
[01:40:31.221 --> 01:40:32.541]  They've got more machines in, folks.
[01:40:33.022 --> 01:40:34.602]  Machine produces up to 28 liters or 7.5 gallons a day.
[01:40:36.443 --> 01:40:38.524]  About half that in the desert, even more in some areas.
[01:40:39.104 --> 01:40:42.565]  Low operating cost, on average 12 cents a gallon, pays for itself.
[01:40:43.025 --> 01:40:45.666]  Great tasting, pure H2O, exactly the way nature makes it.
[01:40:45.946 --> 01:40:47.446]  No chemicals, pollutants, or toxins.
[01:40:47.866 --> 01:40:52.148]  Natural pH, neutral pH, 866-585-4044, 866-585-4044, or Ecoloblue.com, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E, dot com.
[01:40:52.168 --> 01:40:53.028]  Ecoloblue, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E,
[01:41:15.735 --> 01:41:16.615]  Who's up next here?
[01:41:19.637 --> 01:41:21.058]  Ray, Peter, John, Ed, and others.
[01:41:21.118 --> 01:41:21.719]  Okay, Ray.
[01:41:22.239 --> 01:41:24.721]  Are you the first caller that's actually fully on topic?
[01:41:28.643 --> 01:41:29.204]  Oh, God.
[01:41:29.464 --> 01:41:30.104]  Ray, are you there?
[01:41:30.124 --> 01:41:32.105]  Hey, Alex.
[01:41:32.406 --> 01:41:32.886]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:41:33.860 --> 01:41:34.540]  Hey, what's up, man?
[01:41:34.580 --> 01:41:35.781]  I'm right here in Austin, man.
[01:41:36.241 --> 01:41:38.042]  Thanks, I appreciate everything you do.
[01:41:38.202 --> 01:41:40.303]  You know, I've seen all your films, or most of them.
[01:41:40.383 --> 01:41:41.164]  Thank you.
[01:41:41.404 --> 01:41:43.805]  What really turned me on was the Waco one.
[01:41:44.405 --> 01:41:47.787]  I'd always question the official story and all that stuff, so, you know, thanks, man.
[01:41:49.028 --> 01:41:49.948]  You know, I am on topic.
[01:41:50.288 --> 01:42:03.335]  I wonder if it had anything to do with the fact that, you know, no one saw Sarah Palin coming, and maybe it had been pre-promised to her in exchange for her looking the other way about the heart projects that are going on in Alaska.
[01:42:04.505 --> 01:42:06.247]  Well, I mean, a governor runs nothing.
[01:42:06.267 --> 01:42:08.549]  I mean, they have true power, but they don't know it.
[01:42:08.589 --> 01:42:09.690]  They're totally federalized.
[01:42:09.710 --> 01:42:12.672]  The Congress has been told they can't even be involved in government now.
[01:42:12.993 --> 01:42:14.614]  NORTHCOM fully rules the U.S.
[01:42:14.634 --> 01:42:20.099]  The United States has been listed as an enemy population for eugenics extermination, just like the Iraqis.
[01:42:21.216 --> 01:42:21.897]  Literally, folks.
[01:42:21.937 --> 01:42:22.618]  It's not a joke.
[01:42:23.619 --> 01:42:25.340]  Yes, reality is hardcore, isn't it?
[01:42:26.281 --> 01:42:29.544]  So, I don't know really what to say about Sarah Palin.
[01:42:31.246 --> 01:42:38.213]  I don't know what you know about it, but I read the Matt Lauer interview, and I have him quoted.
[01:42:38.233 --> 01:42:44.459]  He said, a breakout in technology and covert tactics to seek out and kill insurgent leaders.
[01:42:45.575 --> 01:42:49.837]  And Bob Woodward keeps saying this, you know, I've seen him in two interviews now, and he keeps saying the same thing.
[01:42:49.857 --> 01:42:58.741]  He's mentioned the Manhattan Project, and then he says, all of a sudden, by surprise, one morning, it just, it was peaceful.
[01:42:58.821 --> 01:43:00.861]  You know, that's pretty scary stuff, man.
[01:43:01.422 --> 01:43:05.864]  You know, they mean to shock Russia, shock the world, as they get ready to start World War III.
[01:43:05.904 --> 01:43:06.764]  I appreciate your call.
[01:43:06.784 --> 01:43:11.506]  I mean, what did I say to Dr. Roberts last week when he was on with us?
[01:43:13.571 --> 01:43:15.972]  And by the way, he's coming up in a few minutes.
[01:43:17.972 --> 01:43:23.814]  I said they're doing this unless they're completely megalomaniacs and just completely crazy.
[01:43:24.314 --> 01:43:26.655]  You know, counting flowers on the wall.
[01:43:27.715 --> 01:43:29.556]  That don't bother me at all.
[01:43:29.636 --> 01:43:33.517]  Smoking cigarettes and watching Captain Kangaroo.
[01:43:33.877 --> 01:43:39.939]  I mean, unless they're just dressing up like Easter bunnies and hopping around the front yard.
[01:43:41.094 --> 01:43:44.275]  Uh, while drinking antifreeze, they've got superweapons.
[01:43:44.335 --> 01:43:45.976]  We know they have the superweapons.
[01:43:48.217 --> 01:43:51.158]  They used our money, and now they've turned them against us.
[01:43:51.838 --> 01:43:56.999]  And you got all these prideful people, I'm proud of the USA, hell yeah, we got some bad stuff.
[01:43:59.160 --> 01:43:59.660]  Oh, God.
[01:44:01.721 --> 01:44:04.262]  So we're, again, for listeners tuning in,
[01:44:05.117 --> 01:44:08.960]  Yes, CNN, CBS, oh some incredible new technology.
[01:44:09.341 --> 01:44:11.703]  Folks, they've got so many new technologies it's insane.
[01:44:12.163 --> 01:44:21.731]  You can see them getting ready for all these big announcements and the Pope saying aliens are real and are basically about to land and astronauts and it's just more hoaxes, more scams.
[01:44:22.852 --> 01:44:25.715]  And they want to roll out some, you know, big microwave laser
[01:44:28.445 --> 01:44:30.666]  Radiation gun and scare the hell out of everybody.
[01:44:30.867 --> 01:44:31.167]  Oh!
[01:44:31.727 --> 01:44:31.867]  Oh!
[01:44:32.588 --> 01:44:35.829]  And by the way, they've already given cops ground penetrating radar.
[01:44:36.950 --> 01:44:38.131]  They already looked through your walls.
[01:44:38.171 --> 01:44:42.573]  They already have got ground penetrating radar when you walk through the airport, scanning your naked body.
[01:44:42.854 --> 01:44:44.394]  I mean, a lot of this stuff's already out there.
[01:44:44.715 --> 01:44:45.575]  So we'll see what it is.
[01:44:45.875 --> 01:44:47.476]  It's probably just microwave guns.
[01:44:49.678 --> 01:44:50.038]  Let's go.
[01:44:50.058 --> 01:44:51.058]  I mean, we know they got those.
[01:44:51.579 --> 01:44:53.900]  Hell, they use them on protesters, but turned down on low.
[01:44:54.741 --> 01:44:56.802]  Let's go ahead and talk to
[01:44:58.419 --> 01:44:59.460]  Peter in New York.
[01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:00.000]  Go ahead, Peter.
[01:45:00.561 --> 01:45:00.981]  Hi, Alex.
[01:45:02.803 --> 01:45:04.624]  One of the other callers mentioned Tom Bearden.
[01:45:06.265 --> 01:45:13.851]  It reminded me of an article, because I haven't been to his website in a few years, but I'm pretty sure I remember an article on his website.
[01:45:13.871 --> 01:45:23.739]  You might want to bring this up with him if you do get him on, about technology allowing them to transmit viruses through radio frequencies.
[01:45:24.995 --> 01:45:37.419]  Oh, that's well, well actually, there's dormant viruses that have embedded when your immune system beats them, there's still shells of the viruses all throughout your body and it basically, they can go in with certain frequencies and turn them all on.
[01:45:38.380 --> 01:45:38.620]  Nice.
[01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:45.122]  Yeah, to be specific, they're not transmitting viruses through the air, they are activating viruses.
[01:45:45.948 --> 01:45:48.950]  Well, it's been a few years since I read it.
[01:45:48.990 --> 01:45:51.352]  I wasn't sure if that was the case or not.
[01:45:51.372 --> 01:45:52.193]  Boy, that's deadly.
[01:45:52.373 --> 01:45:53.414]  That's deadly dangerous.
[01:45:54.274 --> 01:45:55.435]  Yeah, it's Buck Rogers, man.
[01:45:55.475 --> 01:45:55.575]  It's 2008.
[01:45:55.615 --> 01:45:58.237]  We got psychopathic eugenicists in control.
[01:45:58.718 --> 01:46:00.579]  I appreciate your input there, Peter.
[01:46:01.179 --> 01:46:02.641]  John in Michigan, you're on the air.
[01:46:04.862 --> 01:46:05.102]  Alex?
[01:46:05.483 --> 01:46:05.783]  Yes, sir.
[01:46:05.863 --> 01:46:06.243]  Hello?
[01:46:06.804 --> 01:46:06.944]  Yes.
[01:46:07.024 --> 01:46:07.124]  Alex?
[01:46:08.105 --> 01:46:09.646]  I can only... What, you don't hear me?
[01:46:10.527 --> 01:46:11.567]  Oh yeah, I hear you.
[01:46:11.667 --> 01:46:13.808]  I just, I was on a cell phone speaker.
[01:46:13.908 --> 01:46:14.548]  Okay, it's okay.
[01:46:14.568 --> 01:46:15.089]  Go ahead.
[01:46:15.169 --> 01:46:17.229]  I read Tom Burden's same information.
[01:46:17.389 --> 01:46:18.850]  I listened to him last night.
[01:46:18.870 --> 01:46:23.172]  He was talking about the super rockets that are on the way.
[01:46:23.332 --> 01:46:24.852]  I'm going to have to let you go.
[01:46:24.892 --> 01:46:25.712]  Your phone's bad.
[01:46:26.073 --> 01:46:27.733]  Call me back if you can get it working, John.
[01:46:27.753 --> 01:46:30.074]  Ed in Utah, you're on the air.
[01:46:32.375 --> 01:46:33.575]  Hey Alex, thanks for everything.
[01:46:33.915 --> 01:46:34.275]  Thank you.
[01:46:34.916 --> 01:46:38.637]  We're planting the stakes of patriotism really deep here in Utah.
[01:46:39.865 --> 01:46:41.506]  Thanks to you and lots of other good people.
[01:46:41.927 --> 01:46:42.427]  Thank you.
[01:46:42.967 --> 01:46:44.889]  I just wanted to say HAARP.
[01:46:45.149 --> 01:46:50.772]  I was going to conjecture that it's the HAARP technology that they're using for the superweapons.
[01:46:51.073 --> 01:46:58.498]  Yeah, not specifically from Alaska or the one they've got in Europe, but localized.
[01:46:59.498 --> 01:47:06.523]  Yeah, and when he says, it's time for everybody to get out of town, like you said earlier, you know, they can blanket the whole area.
[01:47:07.543 --> 01:47:09.670]  with this harp technology very easily.
[01:47:09.690 --> 01:47:13.763]  And you can tell they've done it because there's rings in the sky.
[01:47:14.984 --> 01:47:35.957]  Exactly, and in the spring, because it's somehow involved in the residents, they can do weather control, mind control, and by the way, that's major government white papers, research institutes going back 30, 40 years, and that's even the Baltimore Sun admits DARPA has put up towers in our cities and is practicing different residences to manipulate our brains.
[01:47:36.317 --> 01:47:37.558]  I mean, it's real, folks.
[01:47:37.598 --> 01:47:38.739]  These people are out of control.
[01:47:39.419 --> 01:47:40.860]  That's why they're so arrogant.
[01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:42.621]  That's why it's so funny to them.
[01:47:44.505 --> 01:47:44.945]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:47:44.985 --> 01:47:45.586]  God bless you.
[01:47:46.106 --> 01:47:46.707]  Thank you, sir.
[01:47:46.747 --> 01:47:47.748]  I appreciate your call.
[01:47:48.248 --> 01:47:50.010]  Listen, a $64 million question.
[01:47:50.050 --> 01:47:51.751]  I'm going to leave the phones open all day for this.
[01:47:53.813 --> 01:47:54.894]  Is military people.
[01:47:55.454 --> 01:47:57.976]  It is not secret that you've got microwave weapons.
[01:47:58.637 --> 01:48:05.923]  It is not secret that they've got aircraft with different directed energy weapons, chemical lasers, particle beams, is what's declassified.
[01:48:05.943 --> 01:48:08.125]  You know, that's been out for 20 years.
[01:48:08.825 --> 01:48:10.527]  It's not secret that they've got
[01:48:12.216 --> 01:48:17.921]  Robotic space planes, weapons platforms that have meteor guns.
[01:48:19.222 --> 01:48:21.684]  They're called a meteor gun because that's why a meteor speeds up so fast.
[01:48:21.704 --> 01:48:25.287]  But it's DU, fired, it comes in at 30,000 miles an hour.
[01:48:25.567 --> 01:48:26.768]  It's a decapitation weapon.
[01:48:28.950 --> 01:48:33.053]  We know they've got the see-through walls technologies, both sonar, radars, the same technology.
[01:48:33.634 --> 01:48:34.755]  We know they've got all that.
[01:48:36.027 --> 01:48:37.109]  We've had that for decades.
[01:48:37.269 --> 01:48:38.491]  And again, there's my psychology.
[01:48:38.591 --> 01:48:38.871]  We.
[01:48:38.952 --> 01:48:39.152]  We.
[01:48:39.212 --> 01:48:39.833]  I'm an American.
[01:48:39.873 --> 01:48:40.554]  It's my government.
[01:48:40.574 --> 01:48:41.255]  It's my military.
[01:48:41.295 --> 01:48:44.400]  It's not this cancer that hijacked us.
[01:48:44.680 --> 01:48:46.223]  Look, the country's dying of cancer.
[01:48:46.243 --> 01:48:47.104]  The world's dying of cancer.
[01:48:47.144 --> 01:48:47.965]  That's basically what it is.
[01:48:48.166 --> 01:48:48.887]  These people are cancer.
[01:48:50.101 --> 01:48:53.483]  Totally sick killers, and they enjoy their power, and they're going to use it.
[01:48:53.963 --> 01:49:00.388]  But all we can do is wake everybody up to it, to where just everybody's in awe, and not going along with it anymore, and just openly rebuking it.
[01:49:00.668 --> 01:49:04.891]  And saying, we don't care if you keep lying, we know what you're doing, government's criminal, we're not going along with it.
[01:49:05.131 --> 01:49:10.294]  You know, week-long strikes, you know, saying no to everything, just a mass awakening.
[01:49:12.096 --> 01:49:13.697]  Alright, who's up next here?
[01:49:17.059 --> 01:49:18.500]  Chris in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[01:49:20.339 --> 01:49:21.000]  Hello, Alex.
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:28.366]  Alex, in our lifetime, about two years back, DirecTV came out with their satellite system.
[01:49:29.006 --> 01:49:32.349]  And in the earlier models, they had a system which was called an H-card.
[01:49:33.050 --> 01:49:38.335]  And people figured out a way to make that card get TV without paying for it.
[01:49:38.935 --> 01:49:47.943]  So, DirecTV got mad about it and sent waves through your system to blow your card up in that chip.
[01:49:50.470 --> 01:49:52.311]  I remember reading something about that, yeah.
[01:49:53.011 --> 01:50:10.018]  Yeah, so, the way it killed that system like that, and also, I've also heard about these systems now, our Star Wars system, one of the key weapons is a large blimp that has lasers on the front of it, supposed to shoot a missile.
[01:50:10.338 --> 01:50:12.959]  Yeah, that's admitted, they've already got those tethered over the U.S.
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:14.000]  Yes, sir.
[01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:19.482]  But the main thing is instead of burning you, shooting you, they just radiate you and you die a few hours later or a day later.
[01:50:20.259 --> 01:50:37.842]  Correct, and I think in the next 20 years the radiation for cell phones, but the fact of the matter is you can see some of these movies in Hollywood where they slide this device into somebody's car and it kills the computer in a car and kills the alternator and then you're stuck.
[01:50:37.922 --> 01:50:46.844]  But the thing that really kind of interests me is some of these new space weapons where they can launch a bomb in our orbit, which our atmosphere is I think 120 miles above Earth.
[01:50:49.226 --> 01:50:51.109]  Now you're talking about a magnetic pulse weapon.
[01:50:51.129 --> 01:50:51.590]  Stay there.
[01:50:51.610 --> 01:50:51.911]  Stay there.
[01:50:52.031 --> 01:50:53.394]  I want to hear more.
[01:51:01.581 --> 01:51:06.305]  Don't be a victim of sudden cardiac arrest due to inflammation of the arterial walls.
[01:51:06.685 --> 01:51:13.010]  Our hemp foods are anti-inflammatory and gluten-free and can greatly benefit the health of the human body.
[01:51:13.770 --> 01:51:22.117]  By calling 908-691-2608 or visiting hempusa.org, you can benefit from this wonderful natural food source.
[01:51:22.777 --> 01:51:30.201]  Our customers are also purchasing this natural food for long-term storage, camping, survival and emergency food rations.
[01:51:30.722 --> 01:51:36.225]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit hempusa.org today.
[01:51:36.245 --> 01:51:44.190]  Hempusa.org believes that now is the time to plan for the future and food will be your greatest asset.
[01:51:44.810 --> 01:51:51.594]  People spend money on all kinds of things, but our warning is prepare now for food shortages in the future.
[01:51:52.432 --> 01:52:01.118]  So don't delay, call today, 908-691-2608 and see what our powder, seeds and oil can do for you.
[01:52:01.138 --> 01:52:09.003]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero and we knew what to do.
[01:52:09.023 --> 01:52:10.825]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:52:11.045 --> 01:52:17.389]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:52:18.084 --> 01:52:26.666]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:52:26.986 --> 01:52:33.788]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:52:34.068 --> 01:52:37.109]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:52:37.129 --> 01:52:43.010]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:52:43.030 --> 01:52:45.591]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:52:46.091 --> 01:52:54.698]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide, or order the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:52:55.058 --> 01:53:00.102]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[01:53:02.284 --> 01:53:05.447]  How much longer will you ignore the warning signs?
[01:53:07.586 --> 01:53:10.832]  How much longer will you turn away like a blind man?
[01:53:11.012 --> 01:53:16.884]  A choice of life or death, abundance or starvation is made today.
[01:53:16.904 --> 01:53:18.527]  Do you have a long term food solution?
[01:53:19.782 --> 01:53:21.724]  Go to SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[01:53:21.844 --> 01:53:28.428]  Now, for the first time... Now, for the first time, Survivalist Seeds is offering a single-person, 7-year heirloom seed supply.

[01:53:36.074 --> 01:53:37.635]  This is a limited offer.
[01:53:37.675 --> 01:53:41.137]  Just $65 for a 7-year heirloom seed supply.
[01:53:41.217 --> 01:53:42.718]  Only from SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[01:53:42.758 --> 01:53:45.901]  Family size still available at SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[01:53:45.961 --> 01:53:47.082]  Patriots Prepare.
[01:53:47.102 --> 01:53:47.662]  Patriots Prepare.
[01:53:48.162 --> 01:53:49.583]  Slaves hesitate.
[01:53:49.603 --> 01:53:50.743]  Soon we'll know which one you are.
[01:53:50.783 --> 01:53:51.644]  You have no more excuses.
[01:53:51.684 --> 01:53:52.504]  Survivalistseeds.com
[01:54:13.701 --> 01:54:16.822]  The New World Order did a bad, bad thing.
[01:54:21.342 --> 01:54:34.205]  Doesn't matter what super weapons they've got, if we just stop believing in them, stop going along with them, stop funding them, let the establishment know that we're not buying into this anymore, it can all stop now.
[01:54:36.185 --> 01:54:40.386]  Now once their control grid gets more in place, and we're just talking maybe five years away,
[01:54:41.588 --> 01:54:51.617]  It's going to be tough going, folks, and just a lot of you won't listen now, you will listen then, but remember, you won't have a choice but to fight back then.
[01:54:51.637 --> 01:54:58.403]  And a lot of you are going to lose family through these soft kill weapons.
[01:54:58.963 --> 01:55:06.270]  And the bio and chemical weapon program that's going on with the water supply, the food and the air, which is documented, is admitted is much worse than even
[01:55:07.108 --> 01:55:10.069]  All their fancy space-based weapons meant to terrorize and scare people.
[01:55:10.089 --> 01:55:11.689]  This is really just a disinfo hype.
[01:55:12.129 --> 01:55:18.511]  Yeah, they're testing laser guns and microwave guns and stuff they send through the wiring in your house to fry you.
[01:55:18.531 --> 01:55:19.291]  I'd forgotten about that.
[01:55:19.311 --> 01:55:20.272]  I'm glad Chris brought it up.
[01:55:21.252 --> 01:55:22.052]  That's all admitted.
[01:55:23.032 --> 01:55:24.933]  And they've got the blimps tethered and the rest of it.
[01:55:27.314 --> 01:55:31.155]  And we've always talked about how, you know, they can radiate you or they can even put the pellets in your car.
[01:55:31.195 --> 01:55:31.955]  They've been caught doing that.
[01:55:32.095 --> 01:55:33.495]  They got the fast-acting viruses.
[01:55:33.515 --> 01:55:35.136]  That's declassified back in the 60s.
[01:55:36.778 --> 01:55:37.598]  Cancer viruses.
[01:55:38.058 --> 01:55:40.479]  They put the slow-acting ones in your shots, because they love you.
[01:55:40.499 --> 01:55:41.679]  The government's so good, folks.
[01:55:41.699 --> 01:55:42.280]  They're so loving.
[01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:46.841]  Bayer's really nice, giving a million-plus ampules of AIDS out.
[01:55:47.001 --> 01:55:47.681]  HIV, uh-huh.
[01:55:49.522 --> 01:55:50.182]  Don't roll your eyes.
[01:55:50.202 --> 01:55:51.942]  You'd think they'd sue me if that wasn't true, right?
[01:55:52.743 --> 01:55:53.083]  It's true.
[01:55:54.863 --> 01:55:56.123]  So, again, go check into it.
[01:55:57.464 --> 01:56:04.466]  But... Written calls and emails that Rush Limbaugh had
[01:56:05.623 --> 01:56:07.946]  Jason Lewis, out of Minneapolis, St.
[01:56:07.966 --> 01:56:08.647]  Paul, I know him.
[01:56:10.329 --> 01:56:19.961]  On there, talking about us taking over the Democratic Convention, and attacking me or something, I don't know.
[01:56:20.502 --> 01:56:21.763]  Did somebody hear it?
[01:56:21.783 --> 01:56:23.145]  We're getting emails and calls about it.
[01:56:25.157 --> 01:56:30.338]  Okay, and then some smart mouth response about, I don't know why he was bullhorning MSNBC.
[01:56:30.398 --> 01:56:31.038]  They're liberals.
[01:56:31.079 --> 01:56:32.519]  They all know it's an inside job.
[01:56:32.979 --> 01:56:34.059]  And here's the New York Times.
[01:56:34.079 --> 01:56:36.740]  9-11 rumors that become conventional wisdom.
[01:56:41.821 --> 01:56:42.901]  And it just goes into that.
[01:56:42.981 --> 01:56:44.522]  Yeah, it is conventional wisdom.
[01:56:44.542 --> 01:56:45.622]  There's nothing you can do about it.
[01:56:46.402 --> 01:56:46.662]  Okay?
[01:56:47.182 --> 01:56:50.903]  And it's going to become conventional wisdom that you put cancer viruses in the kids' shots.
[01:56:51.584 --> 01:56:53.164]  And that you put mercury lead
[01:56:54.585 --> 01:57:02.473]  Arsenic and every other known heavy metal in our water supply on purpose and call it fluoride, you murderers.
[01:57:04.294 --> 01:57:10.661]  You know, Dr. Monteith brought that up last week and I'd forgotten because it's admitted that they take toxic waste and call it fluoride.
[01:57:10.861 --> 01:57:12.402]  You know, as if the fluoride isn't bad enough.
[01:57:12.863 --> 01:57:14.144]  Chris in Tennessee, finish up.
[01:57:14.767 --> 01:57:25.515]  Yeah, Alex, real quickly, when DirecTV purposely burnt all these cards, no one's talked about this story, and to me, it was electronic warfare when you brought this up.
[01:57:25.555 --> 01:57:30.138]  But Alex, in the 70s, I grew up next to Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York,
[01:57:30.618 --> 01:57:36.881]  And at that time, they were experimenting with a high-pitched noise that was really deafening, similar to a dog whistle.
[01:57:37.281 --> 01:57:44.644]  And I think those type of weapons that will blow people's eardrums out and make their brains bleed is something that they're working on.
[01:57:44.664 --> 01:57:45.284]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:57:46.104 --> 01:57:48.065]  And they baby-step us with PAP.
[01:57:48.545 --> 01:57:50.066]  A little bit of rice cereal first.
[01:57:50.966 --> 01:57:53.827]  They rolled those out in the RNC four years ago.
[01:57:53.847 --> 01:57:55.648]  Now they've got them in most police departments waiting.
[01:57:56.331 --> 01:58:02.574]  When you were talking about the contest you had for the Constitution yesterday, with so many people who replied, I thought about you needing to bail out like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
[01:58:25.506 --> 01:58:27.967]  I think the best thing is to have everybody read it and pick one.
[01:58:28.167 --> 01:58:34.691]  But Alex, no one's discussed this subject again, and I want to thank you again with 9-1-1 approaching us.
[01:58:34.731 --> 01:58:35.532]  Today's 9-9-0-8.
[01:58:35.692 --> 01:58:38.414]  We're finally getting some facts out.
[01:58:38.694 --> 01:58:39.874]  Good job, Chris.
[01:58:39.894 --> 01:58:40.555]  We got a job.
[01:58:40.615 --> 01:58:41.455]  More calls straight ahead.
[01:58:43.276 --> 01:58:46.798]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.879 --> 01:58:48.680]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.915 --> 01:58:58.320]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:58:58.660 --> 01:59:00.642]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:59:01.322 --> 01:59:02.343]  But who is the enemy?
[01:59:02.864 --> 01:59:03.364]  Bin Laden.
[01:59:03.644 --> 01:59:04.485]  This is his M.O.
[01:59:04.525 --> 01:59:06.026]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:59:06.046 --> 01:59:07.687]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:59:08.028 --> 01:59:14.773]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:59:15.173 --> 01:59:15.613]  Some U.S.
[01:59:15.653 --> 01:59:21.318]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:59:21.998 --> 01:59:25.480]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:59:25.500 --> 01:59:28.301]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:59:54.389 --> 01:59:56.330]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.790 --> 01:59:59.670]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:06.172 --> 02:00:06.812]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.472 --> 02:00:09.173]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:09.233 --> 02:00:10.353]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.993 --> 02:00:11.813]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.574 --> 02:00:13.434]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.134 --> 02:00:17.795]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.315 --> 02:00:22.456]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.914 --> 02:00:24.614]  Calling U.S.
[02:00:24.674 --> 02:00:26.595]  military, calling former military.
[02:00:26.615 --> 02:00:29.496]  I don't want you to give out anything classified on air.
[02:00:29.556 --> 02:00:31.876]  None of this stuff is classified.
[02:00:32.836 --> 02:00:35.957]  They always think it up in think tanks and brag right in our face what they're doing.
[02:00:36.297 --> 02:00:38.678]  And there's always classified versions of it.
[02:00:39.058 --> 02:00:53.022]  You know, the particle beams, the radiation guns, the microwave guns, the sound cannons, the direct energy weapons through phone lines, power lines, looking through wall technology, drones, robo-rats,
[02:00:53.917 --> 02:00:57.721]  Cockroaches with explosives that crawl in your ear and blow the side of your head off.
[02:00:57.761 --> 02:00:58.802]  That's all declassified.
[02:01:00.163 --> 02:01:04.266]  Race-specific bioweapons targeted to certain families or clans.
[02:01:05.508 --> 02:01:09.611]  We know all that's being tested in death laboratories, death core laboratories.
[02:01:10.972 --> 02:01:12.214]  An excellent one
[02:01:14.167 --> 02:01:32.450]  1,300,000 extermination over the last five and a half years in Iraq by excellent, excellent results for the new world order, excellent results with the drug war, more drugs, more people in prison, the economy falling apart, more robberies, education, excellent job, everybody being dumbed down, mindless idiots, just a mechanized evil going quite well.
[02:01:32.511 --> 02:01:36.031]  It's hard to build stuff and be good, nice and help people and be loving and be strong.
[02:01:36.411 --> 02:01:40.392]  It's easy to be evil and sickening and twisted and degenerate and scum filled.
[02:01:42.096 --> 02:01:44.479]  So we're taking your calls about what are the superweapons.
[02:01:44.539 --> 02:01:46.242]  I want the military to call in here.
[02:01:49.105 --> 02:01:50.167]  I've listed all of these.
[02:01:50.247 --> 02:01:54.653]  Bob Woodward's out saying there's this incredible superweapon as big as the Manhattan Project.
[02:01:54.713 --> 02:01:55.454]  Leap forward.
[02:01:55.474 --> 02:01:58.498]  Well, we know what all these systems are.
[02:01:58.578 --> 02:02:00.000]  Which one is he talking about?
[02:02:00.729 --> 02:02:02.050]  It's so wondrous in Iraq.
[02:02:02.070 --> 02:02:02.891]  We know that's all bull.
[02:02:02.911 --> 02:02:09.717]  We know they funded the attacks, funded it, funded the breakup, funded the three groups killing each other, and then paid them off to stop.
[02:02:09.757 --> 02:02:11.378]  And that's admitted, so it's not my opinion.
[02:02:11.858 --> 02:02:23.929]  This isn't just trying to scare everybody and act real, you know, elitist, and claim, you know, our economy may be imploding, and we may have leveraged fiat currency and bought up the planet with it, but we've got, we've got space rage.
[02:02:24.309 --> 02:02:24.769]  Don't run!
[02:02:24.809 --> 02:02:25.650]  We are your friends!
[02:02:25.710 --> 02:02:27.712]  You know, Mars attacks, shooting everybody.
[02:02:29.125 --> 02:02:30.666]  I mean, whatever, man, whatever.
[02:02:32.146 --> 02:02:33.867]  Let's go to Dan in Georgia, then Dennis.
[02:02:34.947 --> 02:02:36.027]  Uh-oh, claims he has it.
[02:02:36.107 --> 02:02:36.508]  J.D.
[02:02:36.548 --> 02:02:37.588]  in Idaho.
[02:02:37.628 --> 02:02:38.848]  Let's skip to J.D.
[02:02:39.249 --> 02:02:40.109]  J.D., what is it?
[02:02:41.249 --> 02:02:41.609]  I'm there.
[02:02:41.629 --> 02:02:42.590]  Are you ready?
[02:02:42.790 --> 02:02:43.030]  Yes.
[02:02:43.850 --> 02:02:47.011]  Okay, everybody who knows history knows the inventor of A.C.
[02:02:47.051 --> 02:02:49.112]  was Nikola Tesla, correct?
[02:02:49.272 --> 02:02:49.532]  Yes.
[02:02:50.032 --> 02:02:50.312]  Okay.
[02:02:51.253 --> 02:02:53.493]  He had many, many inventions, hundreds of them.
[02:02:53.794 --> 02:02:57.535]  And the FBI grabbed it and burned down his place and killed a bunch of people.
[02:02:59.358 --> 02:03:05.783]  The one weapon that is, from what I've learned, is the deadliest of all, is scalar weapons.
[02:03:06.164 --> 02:03:07.225]  The scalar death ray.
[02:03:07.565 --> 02:03:13.491]  Scalar weapons can pinpoint anyone in the world, one person, and kill him.
[02:03:13.711 --> 02:03:14.732]  Doesn't matter where he's at.
[02:03:15.212 --> 02:03:18.195]  If they can pinpoint him, they can kill him from anywhere in the world.
[02:03:18.655 --> 02:03:19.676]  And this is scary stuff.
[02:03:19.716 --> 02:03:21.498]  I learned about this five or six years ago.
[02:03:21.518 --> 02:03:22.579]  And it's scary.
[02:03:23.326 --> 02:03:25.606]  And who knows what they've done with it since then.
[02:03:25.687 --> 02:03:29.307]  Possibly they could destroy hundreds, if not thousands of people.
[02:03:29.427 --> 02:03:29.967]  I don't know.
[02:03:30.027 --> 02:03:30.728]  But it's scary.
[02:03:30.768 --> 02:03:31.588]  Now, let me stop you.
[02:03:31.628 --> 02:03:32.648]  Scalar is real.
[02:03:33.348 --> 02:03:33.568]  Yes.
[02:03:33.728 --> 02:03:39.449]  There's a lot of kooks and quacks who then claim that they have reverse engineered it and they're full of baloney.
[02:03:39.809 --> 02:03:44.070]  That's the problem, is that a lot of this stuff has a basis in reality.
[02:03:44.430 --> 02:03:46.431]  It's just that the quacks have run wild with it.
[02:03:47.251 --> 02:03:48.151]  Well, how do you feel about it?
[02:03:49.280 --> 02:03:50.001]  I mean, I know.
[02:03:50.141 --> 02:03:56.249]  I've read in major scientific journals that they've discovered decades ago and confirmed Tesla's scalar properties.
[02:03:56.850 --> 02:03:58.813]  They just don't know how to control it.
[02:03:59.557 --> 02:04:04.000]  I've heard that they can actually increase the strength of a hurricane by using a scalar weapon.
[02:04:04.040 --> 02:04:11.645]  Now that was all certified Stanford Research Institute, declassified three years ago, AP, Reuters, Fox News.
[02:04:12.026 --> 02:04:20.371]  They could create, control, steer, weaken, strengthen hurricanes with eight airplanes in 1967 with conventional nuclei spring.
[02:04:23.113 --> 02:04:24.274]  So I don't know about scalar.
[02:04:25.271 --> 02:04:27.494]  It's pretty scary stuff what I have researched.
[02:04:27.614 --> 02:04:30.438]  If you ever get the time, do some research on it.
[02:04:31.118 --> 02:04:33.181]  No, I've done research.
[02:04:33.802 --> 02:04:37.266]  Most of the academics that have written on it are too scared to come on the show.
[02:04:37.927 --> 02:04:44.575]  And I mean academics, not the quacks running around claiming they've got, you know, proton beams in their backyard, but I mean the real deal.
[02:04:45.367 --> 02:04:46.848]  And they've killed so many of these people.
[02:04:46.868 --> 02:04:47.809]  They kill them all the time.
[02:04:48.189 --> 02:04:50.130]  It's just absolute mass murder everywhere.
[02:04:50.490 --> 02:04:52.071]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts straight ahead.
[02:04:52.111 --> 02:04:57.234]  I will get to Dan and Dennis and JD and Kilroy and everybody else.
[02:04:57.294 --> 02:04:58.115]  I'm gonna get to all of you.
[02:04:58.135 --> 02:04:58.495]  Stay with us.
[02:05:01.918 --> 02:05:14.651]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[02:05:15.052 --> 02:05:18.896]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[02:05:19.236 --> 02:05:25.759]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[02:05:26.100 --> 02:05:29.281]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[02:05:29.521 --> 02:05:37.025]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[02:05:53.053 --> 02:05:55.314]  We're in a no-holds-barred information war.
[02:05:55.694 --> 02:06:00.997]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[02:06:01.602 --> 02:06:08.525]  Drink and Mate proudly presents another mind-boggling episode of America's toughest quiz show, That's Too Complicated!
[02:06:08.885 --> 02:06:14.488]  Let's see if we can figure out which contestant got the intellectual edge after an evening of partying by using Drink and Mate!
[02:06:14.588 --> 02:06:22.091]  For 20 points in the wind, Milt, Glur-5 and blank kinate receptor subunits in hippocampal neurons co-assemble to form functional receptors.
[02:06:22.431 --> 02:06:23.631]  Uh, uh, Pony?
[02:06:24.932 --> 02:06:26.012]  Oh, too bad!
[02:06:26.433 --> 02:06:26.973]  Yes, Chip!
[02:06:27.722 --> 02:06:30.303]  The logical companion of Glur 5, Glur 6.
[02:06:31.384 --> 02:06:32.685]  You've won the game!
[02:06:32.765 --> 02:06:34.065]  Hey, life is like a game.
[02:06:34.146 --> 02:06:36.967]  And if you want to win, you've got to give it your best every day.
[02:06:37.087 --> 02:06:40.429]  Which doesn't always happen after an evening of celebrating with friends and family.
[02:06:40.669 --> 02:06:42.210]  That's why there's Drink and Mate.
[02:06:42.370 --> 02:06:46.812]  A patented formula of guava leaf extract, proven to reduce the effects of hangover.
[02:06:46.832 --> 02:06:50.434]  It restores balance to your body, keeping headaches and nausea at bay.
[02:06:50.614 --> 02:06:51.635]  And it really works!
[02:06:51.795 --> 02:06:52.475]  Tell them, Don!
[02:06:52.656 --> 02:06:53.296]  Drink and Mate!
[02:06:53.676 --> 02:06:55.618]  I wouldn't be able to read this without it!
[02:06:55.938 --> 02:06:58.301]  Available at quality retailers nationwide.
[02:06:58.461 --> 02:07:00.803]  Drinkinator urges you to please drink responsibly.
[02:07:01.844 --> 02:07:04.387]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:07:05.008 --> 02:07:14.197]  Have you ever wondered what former President George Herbert Walker Bush meant in 1990 by saying the Desert Storm War was a good chance to start the New World Order?
[02:07:15.154 --> 02:07:21.965]  The New World Order would cause us to lose our freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and also our national sovereignty.
[02:07:22.867 --> 02:07:24.329]  Is this what Americans want?
[02:07:24.550 --> 02:07:27.595]  To be merged into a communist-style one-world government?
[02:07:28.570 --> 02:07:37.118]  We'd like to help you to understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:08:01.891 --> 02:08:07.493]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:11.354 --> 02:08:13.114]  I had Dr. Paul Greg Roberts on
[02:08:13.857 --> 02:08:16.701]  A few weeks ago, we said, why did they sneak attack Russia?
[02:08:17.141 --> 02:08:17.682]  Why did the U.S.
[02:08:17.742 --> 02:08:18.643]  back towards it to do it?
[02:08:18.683 --> 02:08:20.225]  Why are they starting World War III?
[02:08:20.786 --> 02:08:22.488]  Why are they so arrogant?
[02:08:22.648 --> 02:08:24.150]  And I said, superweapons.
[02:08:25.212 --> 02:08:29.056]  We know they've got a decapitation system through Star Wars, a bunch of robotic...
[02:08:30.203 --> 02:08:40.645]  Platforms that have basically meteor guns for dropping, and this has been declassified parts of it, dropping DU rounds, solid rounds that get up to about 30,000 miles an hour.
[02:08:41.185 --> 02:08:44.145]  They can kill people in, you know, 500-foot deep bunkers.
[02:08:45.006 --> 02:08:45.706]  No problem.
[02:08:45.886 --> 02:08:47.786]  Devastating effect.
[02:08:47.826 --> 02:08:49.866]  Blows the whole side of a mountain out, just one of them.
[02:08:49.986 --> 02:08:51.447]  Weighs about 100 pounds, the bigger ones.
[02:08:52.067 --> 02:08:54.607]  They've got microwave guns, particle beams.
[02:08:55.387 --> 02:08:56.247]  I mean, you name it.
[02:08:56.267 --> 02:08:59.268]  And then now Bob Woodward comes on
[02:09:01.529 --> 02:09:07.751]  60 Minutes, he goes on CNN Larry King Live last night, and he says they've got a super weapon as big as the Manhattan Project.
[02:09:08.271 --> 02:09:09.992]  That's what made the surge succeed.
[02:09:10.832 --> 02:09:19.015]  Well, funny, talking to people in the military and then even what's been in the press, it was billions of dollars in payoffs to the factions to stop killing each other.
[02:09:19.395 --> 02:09:24.917]  And day one, they ordered the Ba'athists to break up, which caused a civil war, which they knew it would do as an excuse to stay there.
[02:09:25.337 --> 02:09:25.977]  Now they claim
[02:09:27.020 --> 02:09:31.525]  It is a victory to just have the killings subside somewhat.
[02:09:31.585 --> 02:09:34.668]  Now, that's a side issue, but I do want to get Dr. Roberts' take.
[02:09:34.888 --> 02:09:40.874]  A, has he heard about this big sensation with Woodward, Pulitzer Prize winner, talking about superweapons.
[02:09:41.254 --> 02:09:45.699]  This is really like 1984, where they're always giving us a new superweapon to scare the world.
[02:09:46.279 --> 02:09:48.602]  And then I want to get into Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.
[02:09:49.282 --> 02:09:49.742]  Sure, Alex.
[02:10:19.583 --> 02:10:21.565]  What do you think about talk of superweapons?
[02:10:22.645 --> 02:10:25.988]  Well, I don't know what Woodward thinks he's talking about.
[02:10:26.008 --> 02:10:27.209]  It's obviously quite silly.
[02:10:27.569 --> 02:10:32.072]  As you pointed out, they weren't used in Iraq, even if they exist.
[02:10:32.973 --> 02:10:45.963]  And you're correct that the Iraqi violence was essentially contained by us putting 80,000 insurgents on our payroll and by Iran
[02:10:46.893 --> 02:11:09.774]  uh... telling uh... how later to stand down his militia because the continuing violence uh... played into the bush regime's hands but they had to stay there to prevent a bloodbath so the wind-down of violence is due to the iranians calling off the shiites whom they control
[02:11:10.962 --> 02:11:17.624]  And to the United States, hiring the Zunis and putting them on the payroll and paying them not to shoot at us.
[02:11:17.724 --> 02:11:22.246]  So that's all there is to that.
[02:11:23.727 --> 02:11:38.092]  Whatever super weapons Woodward thinks we have, they won't be useful against intercontinental ballistic missiles coming in from Russia or China or whoever we stupidly provoke.
[02:11:40.223 --> 02:11:50.508]  It strikes me as just some kind of BS, maybe propaganda, to make Americans feel secure while their leaders pick a war with Russia.
[02:11:51.188 --> 02:11:52.769]  It sounds like something right out of 1984.
[02:11:52.889 --> 02:11:57.070]  I mean, Big Brother's always got a new superweapon every month.
[02:11:57.331 --> 02:12:00.212]  Yeah, well, that's what Hitler was saying in his final days, remember?
[02:12:01.312 --> 02:12:04.834]  Hitler was raving about all the new superweapons that were going to turn the
[02:12:06.461 --> 02:12:08.742]  Oh my God, I didn't put two and two together!
[02:12:08.822 --> 02:12:09.643]  They are!
[02:12:10.083 --> 02:12:14.365]  They've literally entered bunker mentality with bragging about superweapons.
[02:12:15.845 --> 02:12:25.409]  Well, uh, I think the, uh, uh, they, if they have any superweapons, uh, they don't have economic ones, or they haven't, they showed them to us yet.
[02:12:25.609 --> 02:12:33.833]  Um, this Fannie, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, uh, coming under the Treasuries,
[02:12:35.406 --> 02:12:37.548]  Let me tell you what I think that's about.
[02:12:40.751 --> 02:12:53.341]  The United States, because of its huge budget and trade deficits, has to rely on the recycling of the trade deficit dollars to come back and finance our government and to finance our mortgage market.
[02:12:56.039 --> 02:13:09.085]  The foreigners were getting more and more reluctant to continue the recycling at the same rate because of dollar weakness and because of the apparent loss in value of these mortgages.
[02:13:09.385 --> 02:13:10.866]  And low interest rates.
[02:13:11.326 --> 02:13:11.786]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:13:11.846 --> 02:13:22.211]  And also, you know, you see Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, they issue their own debt in order to be able to carry these mortgages.
[02:13:23.197 --> 02:13:48.598]  They weren't able to borrow and so what the Treasury has done is to give some kind of additional protection to these mortgage giants in order to reassure foreign lenders so they will continue to recycle dollars into the U.S.
[02:13:48.678 --> 02:13:49.459]  mortgage market.
[02:13:50.340 --> 02:13:58.347]  And otherwise, there would be really no prospect at all of keeping the interest rates low.
[02:13:58.647 --> 02:14:01.269]  So this is just bringing the Ponzi scheme to another level?
[02:14:03.111 --> 02:14:04.392]  That's what it is.
[02:14:04.472 --> 02:14:19.004]  Now, the thing that's unsure to my mind about this, and I haven't had time to study this very carefully, but what it seems to me is if the Treasury
[02:14:19.908 --> 02:14:24.573]  Uh, takeover or whatever they've done with these two mortgage jobs.
[02:14:25.254 --> 02:14:44.052]  If this means a guarantee of both, all of the mortgages, as well as the two companies' bonds, that is the bonds issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, if it means not just a guarantee of their bonds, but of the mortgages,
[02:14:44.986 --> 02:15:01.870]  Then I'm not sure that the United States Treasury has not placed its own ability to borrow at risk, because the size of that mortgage portfolio is so large that it's unrealistic to think
[02:15:02.967 --> 02:15:03.447]  The U.S.
[02:15:04.088 --> 02:15:05.389]  Treasury can guarantee it.
[02:15:05.809 --> 02:15:13.115]  Well, sir, the way I read it, and of course you're a top economist and I'm not, but the way I read it in the papers, is that they're saying they're guaranteeing all of it.
[02:15:13.155 --> 02:15:16.057]  They're guaranteeing the debt that was sold to people.
[02:15:16.097 --> 02:15:17.438]  They're guaranteeing the packages.
[02:15:17.778 --> 02:15:19.180]  They're guaranteeing the whole thing.
[02:15:19.800 --> 02:15:32.650]  Well, what this suggests to me, then, that they have overreached because sooner or later, financial markets and foreign creditors will figure out that
[02:15:33.866 --> 02:15:48.183]  Such a massive guarantee undermines the Treasury's own financial capability, and therefore it may undermine the ability of the Treasury to sell its own bonds.
[02:15:53.237 --> 02:15:54.957]  They looked like they were laying an egg.
[02:15:54.997 --> 02:16:04.760]  I mean, they were trying to project bad confidence and trying to project that they looked like they'd just been caught with their hand in the cookie jar, you know, caught robbing a bank.
[02:16:04.820 --> 02:16:07.400]  I mean, they were white-faced.
[02:16:07.440 --> 02:16:09.541]  They looked completely freaked out.
[02:16:10.981 --> 02:16:13.701]  The markets seemed to love it, at least for a while.
[02:16:13.762 --> 02:16:15.562]  I mean, this is madness.
[02:16:15.602 --> 02:16:19.883]  And even foreign governments are saying, you know, have we become more communist than China?
[02:16:22.046 --> 02:16:30.308]  Well, I don't think... You see, the notion of it being nationalized or whatever, that's not the real issue.
[02:16:30.348 --> 02:16:41.071]  The real issue is whether the United States Treasury has assumed a financial responsibility beyond its capability, and therefore it would have no credibility.
[02:16:42.131 --> 02:16:46.912]  And that's what I think may come out.
[02:16:46.992 --> 02:16:49.453]  If that comes out, then the whole
[02:16:50.424 --> 02:17:16.940]  The thing is over with very quickly because if people conclude that this guarantee is worthless because the Treasury can't make good on it, just like the guarantee the British gave the Poles in 1940 against the Germans was worthless because they had no way of enforcing it, that may be what we have here.
[02:17:19.086 --> 02:17:21.727]  Well, I don't know what the numbers are.
[02:17:47.606 --> 02:18:04.071]  I think that they're kind of large to give that much of a guarantee, and it may disturb people who are lending the money.
[02:18:04.091 --> 02:18:05.451]  I've got CNBC right here.
[02:18:05.491 --> 02:18:13.313]  It says $54 trillion is what the total assets or the debt, the whole shoot and match of those two groups are.
[02:18:15.742 --> 02:18:17.063]  It seems too much to me.
[02:18:17.083 --> 02:18:20.804]  Well, the way they're always leveraging things, God knows.
[02:18:22.225 --> 02:18:37.470]  Well, I think that temporarily we have a risk fight because the Bush government got foreign central banks to agree to buy dollars so that we could keep the low interest rates through the election.
[02:18:38.190 --> 02:18:42.292]  And this has given some comeback to the dollar.
[02:18:43.227 --> 02:18:52.952]  People will be relieved because they'll see the dollar rising, but it won't occur to them that it'll never go back to parity with the euro.
[02:18:53.372 --> 02:18:55.033]  And the oil price is coming down.
[02:18:55.053 --> 02:18:58.695]  See, when the oil price ran up toward 150, everybody got nervous.
[02:18:58.775 --> 02:19:00.856]  It falls down toward 100, they feel relieved.
[02:19:01.296 --> 02:19:05.178]  The fact that it's not going to go back to 30, they don't think about.
[02:19:06.298 --> 02:19:08.760]  And any time you have
[02:19:09.810 --> 02:19:14.033]  A rise or a decline in market speculators usually take it too far.
[02:19:14.113 --> 02:19:19.097]  They either take it too far up, which it falls back, or they take it too far down, in which it comes back.
[02:19:19.217 --> 02:19:21.198]  But it doesn't mean that it's over.
[02:19:21.939 --> 02:19:23.500]  It renews and starts again.
[02:19:24.441 --> 02:19:36.089]  And I don't see anything that has been done by the United States government or the Treasury that would reverse the bad condition of the dollar.
[02:19:36.829 --> 02:19:38.691]  And I'm fearful
[02:19:39.738 --> 02:19:49.101]  And if this guarantee they've given is as big as it sounds like, then it will impair the Treasury's own ability to borrow.
[02:19:49.301 --> 02:19:55.342]  And therefore, the Great Superfile will come to an end a lot quicker than we thought.
[02:19:55.402 --> 02:19:56.203]  Okay, Doc, stay there.
[02:19:56.263 --> 02:19:57.323]  See, I'm getting different numbers.
[02:19:57.363 --> 02:20:01.364]  Here's a Wall Street Journal saying it's only $1.5 trillion in bad debt.
[02:20:03.689 --> 02:20:04.870]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:20:05.270 --> 02:20:10.735]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:20:11.316 --> 02:20:11.816]  That's right.
[02:20:12.136 --> 02:20:14.779]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:20:14.979 --> 02:20:21.905]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:20:22.445 --> 02:20:30.150]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:20:30.590 --> 02:20:35.454]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:20:36.074 --> 02:20:41.517]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:41.898 --> 02:20:46.020]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:20:46.401 --> 02:20:46.661]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:46.681 --> 02:20:48.502]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:20:51.764 --> 02:20:54.065]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:54.225 --> 02:20:57.908]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:58.208 --> 02:21:08.314]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:21:08.654 --> 02:21:10.655]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:21:11.315 --> 02:21:12.336]  But who is the enemy?
[02:21:12.856 --> 02:21:13.356]  Bin Laden.
[02:21:13.657 --> 02:21:14.637]  This is his MO.
[02:21:14.657 --> 02:21:15.998]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:21:16.018 --> 02:21:17.599]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:21:17.999 --> 02:21:24.742]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:21:25.143 --> 02:21:25.603]  Some U.S.
[02:21:25.643 --> 02:21:31.426]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:21:31.986 --> 02:21:35.467]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:21:35.487 --> 02:21:45.732]  From Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:21:45.752 --> 02:21:46.693]  Fabled Enemies.

[02:22:32.958 --> 02:22:47.838]  I had the opportunity to speak to my 90-year-old grandmother at some length here recently, and she was talking about the Great Depression, and we were talking about the gas prices, the food prices, this economic uncertainty we're in, these, you know, really kind of perilous times, no one knows where we're headed or where we might end up, and she was reminded
[02:22:47.858 --> 02:22:47.998]  I don't
[02:23:04.002 --> 02:23:04.042]  No.
[02:23:04.242 --> 02:23:05.683]  We know one thing's certain right now.
[02:23:05.723 --> 02:23:09.565]  We're headed into much higher prices on food, and there is a global food shortage.
[02:23:09.685 --> 02:23:10.806]  Now, what can you do to prepare?
[02:23:10.826 --> 02:23:11.627]  Do what I did.
[02:23:11.827 --> 02:23:13.288]  Sell some toys off in the garage.
[02:23:13.388 --> 02:23:16.069]  Go to the J. Michael Stevens eFoodsDirect.com company.
[02:23:16.189 --> 02:23:17.990]  Get some food and put it away, and be safe.

[02:23:21.813 --> 02:23:22.413]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:23:22.433 --> 02:23:22.513]  1-800-409-5633.
[02:23:22.533 --> 02:23:23.214]  Put some food away.
[02:23:23.234 --> 02:23:23.694]  Do it now.
[02:23:23.714 --> 02:23:23.774]  1-800-409-5633.
[02:23:33.641 --> 02:23:34.101]  Okay.
[02:23:37.244 --> 02:23:40.126]  During the break, I read about, scanned through about 10 different articles.
[02:23:41.707 --> 02:23:47.251]  They're talking about the global mortgage structure being $15 plus trillion.
[02:23:47.751 --> 02:23:48.512]  The total U.S.
[02:23:48.572 --> 02:23:50.573]  mortgage AP says is $12 trillion.
[02:23:51.213 --> 02:23:52.855]  It says more than $5 trillion of that.
[02:23:52.895 --> 02:23:53.835]  I'm reading it right now.
[02:23:54.336 --> 02:23:56.817]  Bailout doesn't curb all credit woes is the headline.
[02:23:57.558 --> 02:24:00.320]  $5 trillion of that is Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
[02:24:01.247 --> 02:24:05.911]  But regardless, when you get into these numbers, it's just staggering, and then it causes a domino effect.
[02:24:06.712 --> 02:24:08.994]  Dr. Roberts, they're trying to do this balancing act.
[02:24:09.655 --> 02:24:16.881]  I mean, what do you think of the current policy, and does this take over both good or bad for the future of the economy?
[02:24:18.202 --> 02:24:27.451]  Well, I think, as we were saying, that it's created a new problem, which is the Treasury's own credibility, because it's now guaranteed
[02:24:29.073 --> 02:24:30.794]  Probably beyond its ability.
[02:24:31.214 --> 02:24:35.676]  The only way it can make good on the guarantee is to borrow the money itself.
[02:24:36.617 --> 02:24:52.764]  Now, I'm looking here at a Reuters news release yesterday, and it says that China owned $376 billion of the debt issued by U.S.
[02:24:52.804 --> 02:24:55.745]  government agencies, principally Fannie and Freddie.
[02:24:56.710 --> 02:25:08.179]  So that means they own the bonds issued by the two mortgage companies, which is a different trouble instrument from the mortgages themselves.
[02:25:09.480 --> 02:25:16.225]  And, of course, the bonds of the two mortgage companies were trouble because their mortgage holdings were trouble.
[02:25:16.385 --> 02:25:22.790]  So the question China faces is that when the U.S.
[02:25:22.830 --> 02:25:23.250]  Treasury
[02:25:24.219 --> 02:25:25.140]  I think so.
[02:25:37.908 --> 02:25:50.460]  They already have to issue $600 billion just to finish... So what you're saying is if governments of Europe, the Arabs, China, Japan don't buy this new questionable debt, then what happens?
[02:25:51.081 --> 02:25:52.462]  Yeah, then the whole empire is over.
[02:25:55.094 --> 02:25:58.176]  Okay, you were saying that before the break, talking about not having credibility.
[02:25:58.656 --> 02:26:02.538]  They went to the Euro, tried to get NATO and the Euro to put sanctions on.
[02:26:03.118 --> 02:26:04.339]  Russia didn't happen.
[02:26:04.359 --> 02:26:07.121]  Italy said it was ridiculous.
[02:26:07.241 --> 02:26:08.601]  Russia laughed at us.
[02:26:09.702 --> 02:26:12.844]  And then meanwhile, our government's talking about super weapons.
[02:26:12.924 --> 02:26:15.585]  It does look like Hitler in the bunker.
[02:26:17.606 --> 02:26:22.149]  Well, I don't know if they are that aware of their precarious position.
[02:26:24.299 --> 02:26:27.420]  I'm not sure that they are, but they may be.
[02:26:28.981 --> 02:26:32.303]  In which case, that's a good analogy.
[02:26:33.703 --> 02:26:47.610]  But I think one thing we can conclude is that the Treasury had to step in and do something because of the recycling of dollars.
[02:26:48.430 --> 02:26:51.532]  If the foreigners quit recycling the dollars,
[02:26:52.509 --> 02:26:54.890]  That they earn from our trade deficit.
[02:26:55.511 --> 02:26:57.192]  We have no way to finance the government.
[02:26:57.932 --> 02:27:03.715]  Just the government's daily operations, which is independent of all these other financial crises.
[02:27:04.276 --> 02:27:07.417]  Now, you used to run the Treasury, so they have to know these dangers.
[02:27:07.557 --> 02:27:15.742]  I mean, you know, they're up there running it now, so why did they do the bailout if it endangers the entire credibility of the overall structure?
[02:27:16.537 --> 02:27:20.478]  Well, you may assume that they know more than they do.
[02:27:20.638 --> 02:27:23.880]  Remember that this government has shown every kind of hubris.
[02:27:25.780 --> 02:27:34.923]  And hubris leads people to overreach and to step into quicksand and to do all kinds of stupid things that they shouldn't do.
[02:27:34.963 --> 02:27:38.825]  You have to also know that when I was in the Treasury, we still had regulation.
[02:27:38.865 --> 02:27:45.107]  We didn't have all of these unregulated financial instruments that nobody really understands.
[02:27:45.945 --> 02:27:49.369]  And we didn't have these kinds of vulnerable debt structures.
[02:27:50.571 --> 02:27:58.020]  All of this has been created in the decades after Reagan, from the progressive deregulation.
[02:27:58.160 --> 02:27:58.901]  Now what, in 93 and then 96?
[02:28:02.126 --> 02:28:03.987]  I just don't remember right now, Alex.
[02:28:04.407 --> 02:28:16.558]  But I mean, I read the foreign publications, the foreign mainline publications about what happened there, and they talk about leveraging, like where they would take debt instruments and then loan it out through fractional reserve banking and then create new banks and loan it out again.
[02:28:16.598 --> 02:28:17.759]  I mean, is that what you're talking about?
[02:28:17.779 --> 02:28:18.519]  That's right.
[02:28:18.539 --> 02:28:22.983]  And look, I don't know how much time we have left, but there's one other thing.
[02:28:25.894 --> 02:28:29.536]  And I don't know all about this, but I do know something.
[02:28:29.556 --> 02:28:32.056]  They have these credit default swaps.
[02:28:33.257 --> 02:28:35.538]  That is, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
[02:28:35.878 --> 02:28:45.981]  They have all these credit default swaps that I think, when the Treasury steps in like this, legally now have to be unwound.
[02:28:47.161 --> 02:28:54.444]  And I'm not sure what the implications of that is, because
[02:28:55.384 --> 02:28:56.548]  I think so.
[02:29:02.902 --> 02:29:07.804]  That's so large, it's just huge to unwind all of these credit default swaps.
[02:29:08.525 --> 02:29:11.986]  So, I don't know, they may find some legal way not to do it.
[02:29:12.126 --> 02:29:15.008]  Well, Dr. Roberts, we know you'll check in with us as this develops.
[02:29:15.048 --> 02:29:16.468]  We appreciate your great input.
[02:29:16.688 --> 02:29:17.609]  Go write your column.
[02:29:17.629 --> 02:29:18.929]  We appreciate you spending time with us.
[02:29:19.730 --> 02:29:20.310]  Okay, Alex.
[02:29:20.990 --> 02:29:21.771]  Thank you so much.
[02:29:21.931 --> 02:29:22.871]  We're on the march.
[02:29:23.331 --> 02:29:24.932]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:25.853 --> 02:29:28.534]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:43.947 --> 02:29:49.689]  9-11 was a stage, it was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission is here for you.
[02:29:49.729 --> 02:29:57.933]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[02:29:57.973 --> 02:30:02.895]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[02:30:10.727 --> 02:30:14.156]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[02:30:14.176 --> 02:30:16.864]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[02:30:29.201 --> 02:30:34.543]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[02:30:34.903 --> 02:30:36.964]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[02:30:37.224 --> 02:30:40.245]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[02:30:40.525 --> 02:30:47.008]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[02:30:47.408 --> 02:30:49.529]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[02:30:50.009 --> 02:30:53.090]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[02:30:53.310 --> 02:30:57.951]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[02:30:58.091 --> 02:31:01.812]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[02:31:02.032 --> 02:31:03.573]  Travel less, meet online.

[02:32:18.984 --> 02:32:22.806]  Ask yourself, why does our government not allow this crop to grow in the U.S.?
[02:32:23.067 --> 02:32:25.428]  This product is also great for pets and animals.
[02:32:25.588 --> 02:32:26.749]  Call 908-691-2608 or go to hempusa.org today.
[02:32:42.367 --> 02:32:45.609]  There's a man going around taking names.
[02:32:47.129 --> 02:32:50.431]  And he decides who to free and who to blame.
[02:32:52.732 --> 02:32:55.534]  Everybody won't be treated all the same.
[02:32:57.394 --> 02:33:03.537]  There'll be a golden letter reaching down.
[02:33:03.678 --> 02:33:05.318]  When the man comes around.
[02:33:05.478 --> 02:33:08.620]  I wonder if their space planes and particle beams will save them from that.
[02:33:09.947 --> 02:33:18.110]  The hairs on your arm will stand up at the terror in each sip and in each suck.
[02:33:20.011 --> 02:33:32.636]  Will you partake of that last offered cup or disappear into the butterscrap when the man comes around?
[02:33:33.557 --> 02:33:34.377]  We need to stop being
[02:33:40.529 --> 02:33:56.462]  Well, you just heard the former head of the Treasury.
[02:34:09.272 --> 02:34:09.812]  We're good to go.
[02:34:37.068 --> 02:34:46.972]  And they always like to give us a little terror attack or something so we gather around them while they abuse us, while they rape us financially and physically.
[02:34:49.152 --> 02:34:52.594]  Now, Paul Watson is doing an article about what is the secret weapon.
[02:34:52.654 --> 02:35:02.177]  What is the secret weapon that is being used in Iraq that supposedly won the day, which is made up.
[02:35:02.237 --> 02:35:03.918]  It was cash payoffs that won the day.
[02:35:04.648 --> 02:35:10.649]  Pentagon official policy was to go in and break the country up, so sectarian violence is a pretext to stay.
[02:35:11.289 --> 02:35:16.451]  Then they would pay off the insurgents to bring some level of order.
[02:35:16.711 --> 02:35:18.351]  I said that the day of the war.
[02:35:18.851 --> 02:35:20.171]  I said it the day before the war.
[02:35:20.231 --> 02:35:23.492]  I said it the day after the war started in March of 2003.
[02:35:25.292 --> 02:35:26.313]  Not because I'm smart.
[02:35:27.013 --> 02:35:30.113]  I've learned to read what the enemies of liberty and freedom have to say.
[02:35:30.454 --> 02:35:32.374]  What the hijackers of this nation say.
[02:35:34.079 --> 02:35:47.873]  You know, we treat this criminal, illegitimate government like it's official because it wears fancy blue uniforms and fancy green uniforms and lots of shiny epaulets and fancy hats and tells us we've got to bow down to them and, oh, it's so nicely tailored.
[02:35:54.520 --> 02:35:55.120]  It's a joke.
[02:35:55.180 --> 02:35:55.821]  It's a fraud.
[02:35:58.337 --> 02:36:18.004]  I mean, if you were in a Greyhound bus, and some guy came in when you were, you know, parked at a gas station, everybody goes into the rest stop, and somebody comes in, clubs the bus driver in the head in front of you, but then puts on his uniform, everybody would just get on board and say, oh, well, it doesn't matter if you clubbed him in the head.
[02:36:18.024 --> 02:36:21.445]  It doesn't matter if you're hijacking this bus.
[02:36:22.005 --> 02:36:27.087]  We're going to just go ahead and say it's official because you're wearing a blue cap and a blue blazer.
[02:36:28.160 --> 02:36:29.381]  I mean, what has NORTHCOM done?
[02:36:29.421 --> 02:36:33.324]  What has the presidency done, saying Congress runs nothing, and declaring the U.S.
[02:36:33.364 --> 02:36:46.534]  a war zone, and the people enemies, and the CIA domestically operating, and overturning the Bill of Rights and Constitution, and just corruption running rampant, and attacking innocent countries, and lying about why we're there?
[02:36:48.976 --> 02:36:49.716]  It's got to stop.
[02:36:49.737 --> 02:36:50.877]  Let's go to Dan in Georgia.
[02:36:50.917 --> 02:36:51.518]  Dan, go ahead.
[02:36:54.934 --> 02:36:56.595]  Hey Alex, good talking to you, love your show.
[02:36:57.575 --> 02:37:10.624]  I know it's not cosmic or anything, but the microwave gun that we're talking about from the 60 Minutes show, we're led to believe it's just a pulse device for crowd control, population control.
[02:37:11.064 --> 02:37:16.087]  But I'd like to point out an article on Reese.com where it goes right into the
[02:37:17.348 --> 02:37:18.871]  The title is Horrifying U.S.
[02:37:18.931 --> 02:37:30.451]  Secret Weapon Unleashed in Baghdad and it was released August 25, 2003 and it's the account from an Iraqi Infantryman and if I could, could I just read a paragraph from it?
[02:37:30.471 --> 02:37:30.972]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:37:31.895 --> 02:37:36.858]  It says, um, in the midst of fighting, he noticed that Americans had called up an oddly configured tank.
[02:37:37.018 --> 02:37:46.064]  Then, to his amazement, the tank suddenly let loose a blinding stream of what seemed like fire and lightning, engulfing a large passenger bus and three automobiles.
[02:37:46.384 --> 02:37:52.167]  Within seconds, the bus had become semi-molten, sagging, like a wet rag, as he put it.
[02:37:52.508 --> 02:37:54.629]  He said the bus rapidly melted under his
[02:37:55.109 --> 02:38:02.274]  Withering Blast, under this Withering Blast, shrinking it until it was a twisted blob about the dimensions of a VW Bug.
[02:38:02.874 --> 02:38:08.658]  Explicitly described seeing numerous bodies shriveled to the size of newborn babies.
[02:38:09.099 --> 02:38:19.646]  By the time local street fighting ended that day, he estimates between 500 and 600 soldiers and civilians have been cooked alive as a result of the mysterious tank mounted device.
[02:38:21.524 --> 02:38:23.765]  Which again is nothing but a terror weapon.
[02:38:23.806 --> 02:38:26.067]  It's not even as good as normal projectile weapons.
[02:38:26.467 --> 02:38:27.948]  It just produces horror.
[02:38:29.088 --> 02:38:30.769]  And we do know they have things like that.
[02:38:31.810 --> 02:38:35.832]  Yeah, that's sick.
[02:38:37.273 --> 02:38:39.414]  Well, it was photographed in Fallujah.
[02:38:39.474 --> 02:38:40.615]  They use nerve gas.
[02:38:41.760 --> 02:38:49.747]  Artillery launched and they used microwave guns that are not the type you see on 60 Minutes where they widen the beam and it just hurts.
[02:38:50.107 --> 02:38:51.569]  They can focus that and it burns you.
[02:38:52.810 --> 02:38:55.332]  But of course they tell the cattle that it's safe and good.
[02:38:55.732 --> 02:39:09.584]  Remember a year and a half ago the head of the Air Force, the civilian head, like you have the Secretary of the Army, Secretary of the Air Force, came out in Associated Press and said under international convention
[02:39:10.456 --> 02:39:20.679]  It's illegal for us to use microwave guns in Iraq, but if we use it first in the U.S., we can claim that sets a precedent that it's a police device and use them in Iraq.
[02:39:20.699 --> 02:39:22.040]  That should be added to your story, Paul Watson.
[02:39:22.120 --> 02:39:22.720]  I remember that.
[02:39:22.780 --> 02:39:23.440]  I know about that.
[02:39:23.460 --> 02:39:25.481]  Paul Watson's listening.
[02:39:25.501 --> 02:39:26.221]  I wanted to add that.
[02:39:26.881 --> 02:39:29.885]  This device is not just population control.
[02:39:29.905 --> 02:39:33.749]  It just doesn't increase your temperature to 130 degrees.
[02:39:34.330 --> 02:39:35.752]  Molten metal is a big deal.
[02:39:35.912 --> 02:39:41.498]  If they put it out like you said at the DNC, this is population control.
[02:39:41.538 --> 02:39:43.761]  This is giving up our rights as a civilian.
[02:39:44.021 --> 02:39:45.543]  We have no rights anymore.
[02:39:46.784 --> 02:39:48.186]  You know, get together as a group.
[02:39:48.366 --> 02:39:50.288]  Why do you think mayors call us civilians?
[02:39:50.328 --> 02:39:51.790]  You can't do anything at this point.
[02:39:51.830 --> 02:39:54.153]  Why do you think mayors call us civilians for 10 years?
[02:39:54.513 --> 02:39:56.115]  They've been paid off by Delta Force.
[02:39:56.516 --> 02:39:59.920]  They've been paid off, I mean literally, with bags of cash they took over a long time ago.
[02:40:01.597 --> 02:40:15.768]  Woodrow Wilson described that the biggest mistake he made as president was giving the banking system to the elite private bankers, the 12 elite bankers in the entire country.
[02:40:16.128 --> 02:40:20.332]  The issuance of currency, they bought the world with it and then left us holding the bag.
[02:40:21.032 --> 02:40:23.554]  And if we don't like it, we'll just be killed!
[02:40:25.395 --> 02:40:31.040]  And a bunch of dumb, know-it-all individuals
[02:40:32.563 --> 02:40:43.612]  are just running around, still worshipping the government, still flapping Chinese desecrated American flags made by slaves, still just believing the Kool-Aid.
[02:40:43.732 --> 02:40:46.174]  And you better stop believing the Kool-Aid, folks.
[02:40:46.354 --> 02:40:47.575]  That's the only way to turn this around.
[02:40:48.015 --> 02:40:49.817]  The nightmare has not even begun.
[02:40:49.897 --> 02:40:54.020]  And if you don't wake up, the nightmare is going to take place.
[02:40:54.300 --> 02:40:55.241]  And it's that simple.
[02:40:55.681 --> 02:40:58.423]  Dennis in Maryland and Jason, Joe, Alex, Richard and others.
[02:40:58.463 --> 02:40:59.004]  Go ahead, Dennis.
[02:41:01.129 --> 02:41:01.749]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[02:41:01.789 --> 02:41:13.934]  I'm looking at an article here, Army's Greatest Inventions of 2007, and one of the things I want to ensure, all these space weapons pretty much have to have line of sight to work properly, and you've got a lot of air traffic up there.
[02:41:14.414 --> 02:41:25.059]  Well, what's one of these ten weapons that we're honored here is an XM982 Excalibur Precision Guided Extended Range Artillery Projectile.
[02:41:25.679 --> 02:41:27.880]  Now, what this amounts to is a GPS
[02:41:28.812 --> 02:41:34.315]  Navigated artillery round which makes it a mini cruise missile.
[02:41:35.275 --> 02:41:38.317]  And this is old fried and true technology.
[02:41:38.377 --> 02:41:39.177]  Yeah, let me stop.
[02:41:39.217 --> 02:41:40.918]  My cousin was telling me about this.
[02:41:41.358 --> 02:41:47.701]  He was talking about when they're in their bases and they're shooting mortars over the line at them.
[02:41:47.721 --> 02:41:50.943]  How, what was he saying?
[02:41:51.043 --> 02:41:55.645]  It's a system that triangulates and he mentioned
[02:41:56.921 --> 02:41:59.503]  Uh, how they see the arc, the trajectory.
[02:41:59.543 --> 02:42:01.385]  Was he saying it was a new radar?
[02:42:01.925 --> 02:42:02.846]  What was he saying it was?
[02:42:03.126 --> 02:42:10.793]  To where they know exactly where it is, and then their artillery automatically, with GPS, aims down to like a foot of where that came from.
[02:42:12.114 --> 02:42:25.525]  I was, uh, I'm a veteran, and back in 1972, when I joined the Marine Corps, we had an artillery officer who was our enlistment officer, and he went to the range at that time and fired an artillery round that he thought he was safe
[02:42:26.329 --> 02:42:28.251]  Location and within three minutes.
[02:42:28.291 --> 02:42:30.173]  He was told his exact record.
[02:42:30.193 --> 02:42:44.367]  This is this is back in 1972 So but this particular Artillery round with GPS in it it can be it doesn't have to have line of sight and it's true didn't try technology They probably got him even smaller
[02:42:45.194 --> 02:42:48.795]  And these things, GPS is basically a data stream.
[02:42:48.895 --> 02:42:53.816]  So the computer that's on board this projectile, it doesn't have to hit a target.
[02:42:54.196 --> 02:43:03.118]  In other words, it can, as long as it has a GPS location, that computer, as soon as it reaches that location digitally, it can explode.
[02:43:03.519 --> 02:43:09.260]  So that means it can fly into the open window of an automobile, explode before it goes out the open window on the other side.
[02:43:11.199 --> 02:43:21.526]  And the GPS is tried, true, reliable, faithful, and I believe it worked very well for them in the Twin Towers in New York City, and I believe it worked very well for them at the Pentagon.
[02:43:22.026 --> 02:43:24.528]  Well, it certainly did, that 16-foot hole.
[02:43:24.588 --> 02:43:26.509]  Now, wait, I have to go back to memory.
[02:43:27.730 --> 02:43:32.593]  It was out at our ranch at a party about a month and a half ago, two months ago.
[02:43:33.854 --> 02:43:37.076]  My cousin, fresh back from Baghdad, he's been in the Army like 18 years.
[02:43:38.857 --> 02:43:39.738]  He was laughing.
[02:43:41.349 --> 02:43:49.957]  About how they would launch mortar attacks at them and how they would go out and look at them like they were fireworks displays because, you know, they were bored.
[02:43:51.198 --> 02:43:52.239]  And what did he say?
[02:43:52.379 --> 02:43:53.420]  What is the system?
[02:43:54.721 --> 02:43:59.866]  He described it and I was halfway listening because I'd read about, you know, other things like that.
[02:44:00.947 --> 02:44:05.551]  They have those Humvees that have those big cannons, you know, those big 50 cals on the top that
[02:44:06.374 --> 02:44:30.887]  Has infrared and the scope and it electronically like a video game follows wherever you are wherever you're acoustically shooting at them from the gun automatically focuses in on your location and then it fires at you so wherever wherever you know it sees muzzle flashes wherever it gets the you know acoustic reverberation of being fired on it fires at
[02:44:31.654 --> 02:44:32.315]  With precision.
[02:44:32.335 --> 02:44:33.416]  I mean, that's an Urban Warrior 1999.
[02:44:33.536 --> 02:44:37.019]  We're out there filming the Marine Corps with their Humvees doing that.
[02:44:38.020 --> 02:44:40.402]  But my cousin was talking about something else.
[02:44:40.823 --> 02:44:55.055]  It was radar, but he said it's incredibly powerful where they see it as soon as it goes up above like 10 feet and then it automatically maps and dials into their artillery and their mortars and then lays it down on them where it's just completely devastating.
[02:44:55.095 --> 02:44:56.717]  So we should add that, Paul Watson,
[02:44:57.386 --> 02:45:01.490]  I don't know if it's guided artillery rounds, but that would certainly be part of the cocktail of super weapons.
[02:45:19.941 --> 02:45:20.942]  Anything else, Dennis?
[02:45:21.402 --> 02:45:39.780]  No, that's pretty much it, and you know, there's an indication to me anyway that that's probably what hit the Pentagon was a bunker buster, and that may have been the reason for the secondary explosion at the Pentagon, because these bunker busters are designed, engineered to explode and destroy themselves in cases of dud.
[02:45:40.467 --> 02:45:42.868]  Well, they penetrate and then they explode.
[02:45:43.308 --> 02:45:53.512]  Yeah, they explode, but there's explosions throughout the body of the device to assure that there's no identifiable or reverse engineering capabilities on any of the components.
[02:45:53.752 --> 02:45:55.513]  Plus, you don't know who blew up the bunker.
[02:45:55.553 --> 02:45:56.434]  They can also deny it.
[02:45:56.774 --> 02:45:56.954]  Yeah.
[02:45:57.674 --> 02:45:58.314]  That's all, Alex.
[02:45:58.354 --> 02:45:58.654]  Thank you.
[02:45:58.855 --> 02:46:00.095]  Alright, I appreciate your call.
[02:46:00.135 --> 02:46:01.916]  All part of the friendliness of the government.
[02:46:02.836 --> 02:46:05.337]  Let's go ahead and the criminal government.
[02:46:06.358 --> 02:46:07.198]  It's just so sick!
[02:46:08.169 --> 02:46:09.430]  I want them to be good guys.
[02:46:09.470 --> 02:46:10.890]  I want to think everything's okay.
[02:46:10.930 --> 02:46:11.490]  It's not!
[02:46:11.510 --> 02:46:12.531]  They're poisoning us!
[02:46:13.491 --> 02:46:14.972]  And all of us are under the attack!
[02:46:15.952 --> 02:46:18.033]  99% of us are on the wrong end of the stick.
[02:46:19.714 --> 02:46:21.034]  We have to understand we're together.
[02:46:21.134 --> 02:46:22.495]  Military, police, government.
[02:46:23.295 --> 02:46:24.116]  This is real!
[02:46:24.696 --> 02:46:26.577]  And you denying it doesn't make it go away!
[02:46:27.717 --> 02:46:28.478]  God help us!
[02:46:30.298 --> 02:46:32.399]  Jason in Illinois, you're on the air.
[02:46:32.939 --> 02:46:33.800]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:46:33.880 --> 02:46:34.220]  Good, sir.
[02:46:35.687 --> 02:46:37.548]  Well, it's an honor to talk to you, actually.
[02:46:38.389 --> 02:46:44.974]  I just started listening to you a little while ago when I first started, and I apologize for being off topic, but I do hope you'll take my call.
[02:46:45.034 --> 02:46:45.294]  It's fine.
[02:46:45.334 --> 02:46:46.595]  Go ahead.
[02:46:47.196 --> 02:46:57.163]  When I first started listening was around the time that a caller called with Willie Nelson, and all of a sudden, there's an event coming up.
[02:46:57.243 --> 02:46:58.284]  There's an event happening.
[02:46:58.344 --> 02:47:03.288]  So I've got something I just want to kind of throw at you and see what you think.
[02:47:05.089 --> 02:47:17.145]  With the platform that you have, what if you call out some of these egomaniacs like Sean Hannity or someone like that and say, you know what, let's do a televised event.
[02:47:17.966 --> 02:47:20.429]  I'll bring my information, you bring what you got.
[02:47:21.380 --> 02:47:31.366]  Why would the establishment give, we've done that, why would they give us a platform so that we could debunk them and give us attention?
[02:47:31.827 --> 02:47:35.749]  The game they've been playing is ignoring us.
[02:47:37.410 --> 02:47:39.832]  First they ignore you, then they attack you.
[02:47:41.473 --> 02:47:44.315]  First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win.
[02:47:45.515 --> 02:47:49.718]  And I'm just telling you that they're not going to have any televised debates with me.
[02:47:52.081 --> 02:47:52.682]  Okay, thanks.
[02:47:52.762 --> 02:47:53.883]  Well, I just thought it might be a good idea.
[02:47:53.923 --> 02:47:55.924]  I'm not saying it's a bad idea to bring it forward.
[02:47:57.025 --> 02:48:04.170]  I mean, it's one thing if Rush Limbaugh occasionally says I'm a nut, but Limbaugh just bashed us a bunch yesterday, and I haven't listened to the whole clip.
[02:48:04.210 --> 02:48:04.931]  John has.
[02:48:05.371 --> 02:48:07.193]  John, they don't mention us by name, do they?
[02:48:09.374 --> 02:48:10.975]  Yeah, see, they're very careful.
[02:48:11.336 --> 02:48:15.158]  Now, Limbaugh's mentioned me before by name and so have others, but generally they don't.
[02:48:15.659 --> 02:48:16.840]  They're very careful.
[02:48:16.880 --> 02:48:18.441]  They don't want to give us any publicity.
[02:48:19.409 --> 02:48:22.491]  Because they know we're already viral against their disease.
[02:48:22.592 --> 02:48:24.913]  They already know that we're hitting the high ground.
[02:48:25.394 --> 02:48:32.279]  And so they don't want to elevate us or quote, you know, validate it, would be their words.
[02:48:34.641 --> 02:48:36.202]  I think it'd be worth a try still.
[02:48:36.863 --> 02:48:38.224]  Well, we've tried many times.
[02:48:38.264 --> 02:48:39.164]  Thanks for the call, though.
[02:48:39.465 --> 02:48:43.047]  But I'm not bashing you for coming up with the idea.
[02:48:43.067 --> 02:48:44.228]  I'm just telling you we've done it.
[02:48:44.809 --> 02:48:46.450]  But hey, it's your challenges to all of them.
[02:48:47.501 --> 02:48:50.743]  They just arrogantly think I'm begging to challenge them.
[02:48:51.503 --> 02:48:53.504]  These guys only do things if stuff's rigged.
[02:48:53.984 --> 02:48:54.665]  They're cowards.
[02:48:58.227 --> 02:48:59.868]  They think they're still the biggest game in town.
[02:49:00.248 --> 02:49:00.908]  That's changing.
[02:49:01.308 --> 02:49:02.529]  That's why they want to shut the web down.
[02:49:02.789 --> 02:49:04.430]  There was a Washington Post editorial
[02:49:05.376 --> 02:49:18.498]  A few days ago, Kurt Nemo did a big editorial on it last night, saying, shut down the internet, shut down free speech, shut down blogs, and basically register people, tax people, to be able to even basically post on message boards.
[02:49:20.779 --> 02:49:22.419]  I mean, their industry's being shut down.
[02:49:22.459 --> 02:49:29.260]  They're lying, puke-filled, spook-filled, mainline media is dying, and hey, it's too late!
[02:49:30.080 --> 02:49:33.021]  It's too late, like the, uh, Def Leppard song.
[02:49:34.910 --> 02:49:36.531]  I mean, it is too late.
[02:49:37.112 --> 02:49:38.112]  Too late for you.
[02:49:39.413 --> 02:49:41.935]  You can get us individually, but you can't kill this idea.
[02:49:42.756 --> 02:49:44.197]  Ideas are bulletproof.
[02:49:45.638 --> 02:49:46.979]  Okay, who's up next?
[02:49:47.079 --> 02:49:48.460]  Joe in Philly, you're on the air.
[02:49:51.946 --> 02:49:52.266]  Hello?
[02:49:52.526 --> 02:49:53.126]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:49:53.146 --> 02:49:54.287]  I'm going to hold you over, but go ahead.
[02:49:54.707 --> 02:49:55.487]  Hey, how are you?
[02:49:55.507 --> 02:49:57.848]  I'm a Prism Planet TV member.
[02:49:57.908 --> 02:49:59.109]  I listen to you all the time.
[02:49:59.629 --> 02:50:02.290]  I'd like to expand on Dr. Roberts' analysis.
[02:50:03.310 --> 02:50:03.971]  Sure, stay there.
[02:50:03.991 --> 02:50:05.131]  We'll come back, talk about it.
[02:50:06.392 --> 02:50:15.435]  And then we'll also talk to a bunch of other people like Alex, Richard, Helen, and others.
[02:50:15.455 --> 02:50:17.476]  We don't have another guest joining us for about
[02:50:19.629 --> 02:50:20.469]  45 minutes or so.
[02:50:21.530 --> 02:50:22.291]  Very important, guys.
[02:50:22.351 --> 02:50:23.191]  Hope you'll stay with us for that.
[02:50:23.232 --> 02:50:28.516]  But I got some of yesterday's news and today's news that I haven't gotten to, I want to cover, so stay with us.
[02:50:28.556 --> 02:50:38.123]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:50:38.484 --> 02:50:40.425]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:50:41.126 --> 02:50:42.147]  But who is the enemy?
[02:50:42.667 --> 02:50:43.188]  Bin Laden.
[02:50:43.468 --> 02:50:44.188]  This is his M.O.s.
[02:50:44.328 --> 02:50:45.810]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:50:45.850 --> 02:50:47.451]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:50:47.811 --> 02:50:54.556]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:50:54.976 --> 02:50:55.417]  Some U.S.
[02:50:55.457 --> 02:51:01.221]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:51:01.801 --> 02:51:05.244]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:51:05.684 --> 02:51:08.367]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:51:31.824 --> 02:51:34.805]  Every 22 seconds a violent crime is committed.
[02:51:35.065 --> 02:51:37.086]  Are you concerned about your personal safety?
[02:51:37.387 --> 02:51:40.728]  Why wait for something bad to happen when you can take action now?
[02:51:41.008 --> 02:51:41.688]  Be smart.
[02:51:41.949 --> 02:51:42.649]  Be safe.
[02:51:42.929 --> 02:51:44.890]  Trust Pepper Spray instead of your luck.

[02:52:40.218 --> 02:52:45.541]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.

[02:52:47.423 --> 02:52:56.308]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[02:52:56.568 --> 02:52:56.688]  Yes!

[02:53:42.216 --> 02:53:43.699]  Joe and Philly we were talking
[02:53:56.161 --> 02:54:01.064]  Joe, you wanted to bring up something about Dr. Roberts' analysis of the economy.
[02:54:01.084 --> 02:54:01.925]  Go ahead.
[02:54:01.965 --> 02:54:09.309]  Yeah, he hit almost a point, and I'm sure, you know, with his background, he's trying to speak to the layman.
[02:54:10.770 --> 02:54:15.513]  What really happened with Fannie and Freddie is a double-edged sword here.
[02:54:17.134 --> 02:54:20.196]  They were unable to sell their bonds on the market.
[02:54:20.936 --> 02:54:22.357]  Now, historically speaking,
[02:54:24.079 --> 02:54:29.661]  The international market bought Fannie and Freddie bonds similar to the way they purchase Treasuries.
[02:54:30.241 --> 02:54:32.002]  They were considered competing markets.
[02:54:33.503 --> 02:54:38.885]  And now, Roberts is saying that this may have tainted further U.S.
[02:54:38.945 --> 02:54:40.305]  Treasury bonds themselves.
[02:54:40.685 --> 02:54:41.346]  That's correct.
[02:54:41.566 --> 02:54:43.086]  He is correct in that assessment.
[02:54:43.386 --> 02:54:44.507]  Because here's what happened.
[02:54:45.747 --> 02:54:47.828]  There was always this implied guarantee
[02:54:49.139 --> 02:54:54.165]  That in the event that Fannie and Freddie would default, that the government would step in.
[02:54:54.185 --> 02:55:02.494]  But it's not just the default of the mortgages, it's the securities they sold.
[02:55:03.655 --> 02:55:04.175]  That's correct.
[02:55:04.215 --> 02:55:09.137]  In other words, the securities or the bonds that Fannie and Freddie sold are international contracts.
[02:55:09.177 --> 02:55:18.220]  And then those have been leveraged out ten times in fractional reserve banking, and then ten times again, and so that's why we get numbers in the 50-plus trillion.
[02:55:18.380 --> 02:55:28.624]  I mean, it's just... That's correct, because oftentimes the bank will sell the mortgages to Fannie and Freddie, like Citigroup or Welles Fargo.
[02:55:28.644 --> 02:55:30.105]  Well, you sure are informed about this.
[02:55:30.125 --> 02:55:31.265]  This is what you do for a living?
[02:55:32.795 --> 02:55:36.917]  I was actually a regulator for quite a while.
[02:55:37.337 --> 02:55:39.558]  And so I guess there's no regulators anymore.
[02:55:39.618 --> 02:55:40.698]  I guess they're playing golf.
[02:55:41.219 --> 02:55:44.300]  Well, I was one of the people who actually drew the line in the sand.
[02:55:44.400 --> 02:55:46.060]  I haven't worked for a couple years.
[02:55:47.061 --> 02:55:47.361]  Really?
[02:55:50.062 --> 02:55:50.942]  Well, then you're an expert.
[02:55:50.962 --> 02:55:51.703]  You've got the floor.
[02:55:51.783 --> 02:55:52.423]  Tell us what happened.
[02:55:53.254 --> 02:56:02.997]  Okay, so, yes, you're correct in terms of the expansion of the money supply, in that the banks would sell the loans.
[02:56:03.998 --> 02:56:09.940]  Fannie and Freddie would bundle them up in AAA rated securities, which is kind of a false rating.
[02:56:10.660 --> 02:56:12.641]  And then the bank would buy the bond back.
[02:56:13.121 --> 02:56:17.682]  So now the bank has an asset on their books.
[02:56:18.563 --> 02:56:21.964]  And that asset they can now leverage against that asset.
[02:56:24.568 --> 02:56:25.349]  Does that make sense?
[02:56:25.849 --> 02:56:27.670]  Yeah, it sounds like a complete scam.
[02:56:28.171 --> 02:56:28.691]  Well, it is.
[02:56:28.731 --> 02:56:30.753]  It's part of the Ponzi scheme, and you're correct.
[02:56:30.833 --> 02:56:35.376]  It is a Ponzi scheme, but the bottom line is they sell the loans to Fannie and Freddie.
[02:56:35.516 --> 02:56:40.921]  They bundle it up into securities and oftentimes would sell it back to the bank.
[02:56:41.681 --> 02:56:47.065]  Now, here's what happened at the beginning of the year, which is why they went insolvent.
[02:56:48.126 --> 02:56:52.049]  They increased the per-loan limit to $750,000 per loan.
[02:56:55.632 --> 02:57:08.457]  What this did is it enabled the Citigroups, the Wells Fargos, the Wachovias, blah, blah, blah, blah, to sell a risky component known as the jumbo market to Fannie and Freddie.
[02:57:10.418 --> 02:57:18.162]  But the thing is, is that they could no longer sell, Fannie and Freddie could no longer sell their bonds because no one was buying them.
[02:57:18.422 --> 02:57:22.483]  Now the jumbo, what is, uh, $500,000 home loans and above?
[02:57:23.004 --> 02:57:23.924]  And above, that's correct.
[02:57:24.756 --> 02:57:38.494]  So by increasing the loan limit, the banks were able to sell off a larger portion of their portfolios that were causing them to be illiquid.
[02:57:40.557 --> 02:57:42.920]  But they also forced the hand of the government.
[02:57:43.763 --> 02:57:45.565]  Which was to bail out Fannie and Freddie.
[02:57:45.945 --> 02:57:49.769]  Because Fannie and Freddie could no longer sell their bonds on the international market.
[02:57:50.409 --> 02:57:51.110]  Hey Joe, stay there.
[02:57:51.130 --> 02:57:52.411]  We'll be back in one minute.
[02:57:52.911 --> 02:58:01.599]  And then I want you to talk about, from a regulator's perspective, where you see this going, how you see this unfolding.
[02:58:01.619 --> 02:58:02.080]  We'll be back.
[02:58:02.500 --> 02:58:05.222]  Folks, I've done three hours of radio and I haven't even plugged yet.

[02:58:23.793 --> 02:58:27.256]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:58:27.276 --> 02:58:29.277]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:58:29.858 --> 02:58:32.600]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.

[02:59:26.850 --> 02:59:29.631]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:59:35.911 --> 02:59:44.018]  We are now into the fourth and final hour of this Tuesday, 9th day of September, 2008 edition.
[02:59:46.400 --> 03:00:00.253]  Coming up, we're talking to Greg Pound, who had his children kidnapped by the Eugenics Services, Child Pervert Services, the CPS, who lawlessly have kidnapped over a million children a year.
[03:00:01.093 --> 03:00:02.094]  Recap his story.
[03:00:03.385 --> 03:00:05.526]  Amazing story and some new developments.
[03:00:06.407 --> 03:00:14.210]  The next 30 minutes I want to cover some of the news we've been going over and I haven't gotten to yet, and continue with your phone calls, Alex, Richard, Helen, John and many others.
[03:00:15.191 --> 03:00:23.995]  For those who are just now watching live on PrisonPlanet.tv and over the web, we were just talking, we had Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former head of policy at the Treasury on.
[03:00:24.636 --> 03:00:26.857]  He said he believes the Freddie and
[03:00:28.809 --> 03:00:29.730]  Fannie Bailout
[03:00:46.821 --> 03:00:47.001]  Okay, so
[03:01:15.706 --> 03:01:17.427]  Here's what the bottom line is.
[03:01:18.567 --> 03:01:25.710]  It was always implied in the international markets that Fannie and Freddie were implicitly guaranteed by the government.
[03:01:26.610 --> 03:01:35.574]  Had the bonds gone into default, these are international contracts, the bonds are international contracts, then it would compromise the very nature
[03:01:36.306 --> 03:01:38.447]  Of selling any bonds from the U.S.
[03:01:38.507 --> 03:01:44.111]  In other words, it would have brought down the whole system because nobody would have believed in the value of the bonds.
[03:01:44.271 --> 03:01:50.474]  Yeah, so we're talking about being on the verge every month now with some new crisis of a total depression.
[03:01:51.275 --> 03:01:53.236]  It's a double-edged sword.
[03:01:53.576 --> 03:02:02.201]  They had to imply, well, but they did imply, and in fact they did make the guarantee this weekend by taking over the guarantee of that debt.
[03:02:04.189 --> 03:02:06.290]  Which is roughly five trillion dollars.
[03:02:06.971 --> 03:02:09.533]  Now, keep in mind that the government doesn't own the debt.
[03:02:09.573 --> 03:02:11.354]  The bondholders own the debt.
[03:02:12.435 --> 03:02:17.179]  But the government is now making the guarantee on that debt.
[03:02:17.199 --> 03:02:21.802]  It's like an FDIC $100,000 guarantee, but more.
[03:02:21.862 --> 03:02:23.283]  They're saying, we're going to back that up.
[03:02:24.104 --> 03:02:24.464]  That's right.
[03:02:24.484 --> 03:02:27.447]  They're backing up five trillion dollars more of it.
[03:02:27.507 --> 03:02:33.051]  So basically... And the whole economy is a couple trillion a year, but go ahead.
[03:02:34.229 --> 03:02:34.849]  That's correct.
[03:02:34.909 --> 03:02:43.935]  So basically, they've just taken on $5 trillion more worth of guarantees on bonds, which does in fact compromise the Treasuries.
[03:02:45.035 --> 03:02:52.219]  Because now you're talking about the Treasury market as well as the Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac aggregate bond issuance.
[03:02:53.900 --> 03:02:55.121]  So where do you see this going?
[03:02:56.760 --> 03:03:05.780]  Well, I pretty much take Dr. Roberts' point of view, as well as your point of view, that they can only prop up the Ponzi scheme so long.
[03:03:06.243 --> 03:03:16.506]  Now, what happens to all the bankers and the shareholders and the establishment people who bought railroads and land and resorts and gold mines and chateaus with this?
[03:03:16.526 --> 03:03:18.726]  I mean, what happens to them?
[03:03:19.207 --> 03:03:30.830]  Because, you know, they knew what they were doing the whole time, and I believe they've engineered this for a global collapse, then they'll pose as the saviors again and bring us into an even bigger Ponzi scheme with global carbon taxes, as they've said.
[03:03:32.390 --> 03:03:36.292]  As a regulator, do you think they just had hubris and got greedy?
[03:03:37.933 --> 03:03:39.234]  They had hubris and got greedy.
[03:03:40.094 --> 03:03:41.074]  Which is even scarier.
[03:03:41.095 --> 03:03:46.557]  I don't think they actually thought that the whole system would come down as fast as it would.
[03:03:48.378 --> 03:03:52.320]  So this is a replay of what we saw with one brokerage firm in 99, just 100 times bigger?
[03:03:52.340 --> 03:03:52.780]  Oh, this is huge.
[03:03:56.810 --> 03:04:13.323]  This is huge because when you look at the trade deficits, and Dr. Roberts has gotten into this before, we don't have an ability to shrink or to pay off that deficit, let alone our own public debt.
[03:04:15.440 --> 03:04:15.780]  You know what?
[03:04:15.800 --> 03:04:19.582]  I'm going to skip this break because I want to get to all the other callers and we have a guest coming up.
[03:04:20.143 --> 03:04:24.205]  For PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and InfoWars.com stream listeners, we'll continue.
[03:04:24.225 --> 03:04:25.685]  For everybody else, we'll be back in three minutes.
[03:04:26.226 --> 03:04:28.447]  Stay with us and stay there, Joe.
[03:04:29.952 --> 03:04:37.294]  Okay Joe, I know my basic facts on this, but it's clear that you know what you're talking about here.
[03:04:37.774 --> 03:04:41.255]  In three minutes we've gotten this little behind-the-scenes segment that a lot of folks are watching.
[03:04:42.235 --> 03:04:51.237]  Finish up your point of where you think this is going, how people can protect themselves, or any other ideas you've got personally.
[03:04:52.757 --> 03:04:55.898]  Well, I've been listening to you for about two years.
[03:04:56.887 --> 03:05:25.724]  uh... and uh... my actually pretty much agree with you wholeheartedly that this is a manipulation uh... but uh... under the anglo-american empire and that they very much intend to implode the entire system uh... because uh... basically from poverty you can arise a a a very menacing tyrannical fascist global type of
[03:05:27.275 --> 03:05:30.976]  management because people who are desperate will do anything.
[03:05:31.356 --> 03:05:36.897]  And you see them gearing up for the new jobs to be police, checkpoints, surveillance, military.
[03:05:36.957 --> 03:05:38.057]  Yeah, they're doing it.
[03:05:38.838 --> 03:05:44.519]  Oh no, this is definitely, this is definitely, this is definitely fascism before feudalism.
[03:05:45.839 --> 03:05:46.839]  Wow, that's well put.
[03:05:47.199 --> 03:05:48.620]  Fascism to feudalism.
[03:05:48.960 --> 03:05:52.781]  Fascism is the path to their global feudal state.
[03:05:53.301 --> 03:05:53.841]  That's correct.
[03:05:54.434 --> 03:05:55.575]  Fascism to feudalism.
[03:05:55.835 --> 03:06:00.479]  They need the fascist reality to create the feudalistic reality.
[03:06:02.740 --> 03:06:04.822]  Well, I really agree with you, Joe.
[03:06:06.603 --> 03:06:19.793]  The good news is people aren't buying their bull anymore, but I think they're Straussian, and so they're the school of the dictator makes right, and so they're kind of saying, we don't care if you don't like it, we're just going to kill you.
[03:06:20.874 --> 03:06:21.395]  That's correct.
[03:06:21.415 --> 03:06:22.235]  They're full of hubris.
[03:06:23.823 --> 03:06:28.484]  They don't care what you think, because they believe that they possess the power.
[03:06:29.665 --> 03:06:34.346]  So I have a little kind of a metaphysical expression.
[03:06:35.246 --> 03:06:36.526]  Hubris is a paradox.
[03:06:37.227 --> 03:06:39.527]  Those who possess it don't realize what they are.
[03:06:42.848 --> 03:06:44.568]  Well, I don't see things going well for them.
[03:06:44.608 --> 03:06:50.130]  In fact, when we talked to many other economists that come on, they believe, like,
[03:06:51.633 --> 03:06:57.377]  Bob Chapman, that they meant to do the implosion later, but that this came too soon, that they're not ready.
[03:06:58.457 --> 03:06:59.158]  I agree with that.
[03:06:59.278 --> 03:06:59.958]  That is correct.
[03:07:00.839 --> 03:07:03.420]  It's come sooner than they thought it would.
[03:07:03.440 --> 03:07:14.187]  You know, people think that they're calculating, and they are incredibly ruthless in calculating, but they simply didn't see how quickly they had taken down the system.
[03:07:16.408 --> 03:07:17.429]  And now it's coming down.
[03:07:17.569 --> 03:07:18.890]  So they did too good a job.
[03:07:20.776 --> 03:07:25.078]  Uh, well, I think that people of hubris simply can't see reality.
[03:07:25.498 --> 03:07:31.141]  I mean, people at the top of the food chain think that, uh, you know, even people with a couple million dollars... Stay there!
[03:07:31.841 --> 03:07:32.602]  Let's finish up with you.
[03:07:32.622 --> 03:07:32.862]  Stay there.
[03:07:32.882 --> 03:07:33.182]  Here we go.
[03:07:33.202 --> 03:07:37.424]  Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:07:38.744 --> 03:07:41.986]  Fascinating call with the Joe of Regulator.
[03:07:45.509 --> 03:07:51.992]  And he was talking about feudalism in a little behind-the-scenes segment, fascism to feudalism, and how they're blinded by the hubris.
[03:07:52.012 --> 03:07:59.935]  They may be intelligent, they may have their program running, but they're not seeing just how serious it is, what they're creating.
[03:08:00.836 --> 03:08:02.476]  Finish up your point on that.
[03:08:04.977 --> 03:08:12.801]  Well, I mean, I think even people with a couple million dollars in the bank think that they're somehow
[03:08:14.679 --> 03:08:17.825]  That they're going to escape reality.
[03:08:19.068 --> 03:08:23.958]  That is until everything comes crashing down and then they're going to be as impoverished as everybody else.
[03:08:28.473 --> 03:08:45.020]  What's scary is, I can have the head of the New York Business School on, I can have Joseph Stiklitz on, Nobel Prize winner, I can have Dr. Roberts on, I can have economists, historians, economic historians, and they say they've never seen something this bad coming, and no one sees any way out of it.
[03:08:46.021 --> 03:08:57.006]  Except, I think, World War III, which is even worse, and you've got the government running around saying, we have super weapons, we're invincible, and we're seeing a pathology we witnessed before.
[03:08:58.257 --> 03:09:09.820]  Well, I agree with that analysis, is that to divert the ignorant populace from the economic realities, they're going to create wars, more wars.
[03:09:10.020 --> 03:09:19.862]  What do other regulators and people that are in the economic structure, you know, studying it, looking at it, watching it, trying to control it, what are they saying?
[03:09:19.882 --> 03:09:22.663]  I mean, do they see what's happening, or are they drinking Kool-Aid?
[03:09:24.283 --> 03:09:26.424]  Well, you have to realize that these people make
[03:09:27.509 --> 03:09:33.871]  You know, I was one of the few people who spoke out against it from the beginning, and as a result, I've been harassed for 15 years.
[03:09:35.111 --> 03:09:43.853]  But I think that they're willing to toe the line because they get to put their food on the table.
[03:09:45.534 --> 03:09:50.475]  So they toe the line, and that's part of the whole corruption within the whole system.
[03:09:50.615 --> 03:09:55.357]  Well, I mean, they're still delusionally on most of the financial news saying the worst is over.
[03:09:55.397 --> 03:09:56.437]  They've been saying that for a year.
[03:09:57.675 --> 03:09:59.819]  That's a joke.
[03:09:59.979 --> 03:10:03.945]  We're talking about Fannie and Freddie just going into receivership.
[03:10:05.186 --> 03:10:09.433]  These are two of the largest financial
[03:10:10.226 --> 03:10:16.069]  Uh, financial institutions in the world with the debt that they've issued.
[03:10:16.469 --> 03:10:25.294]  So how anyone could say that we're not in a recession, how anyone can say that everything is fine and dandy is delusional.
[03:10:25.334 --> 03:10:26.954]  In fact, I think they're beyond delusional.
[03:10:26.995 --> 03:10:27.835]  I think they're demented.
[03:10:28.215 --> 03:10:45.630]  Well, I agree with you, but then you look at, say, cross-species, gene spliced, they change one gene that makes a tomato taste better or last longer, it randomly changes thousands of others, always creates new amino acids that are horribly toxic to us, they know that's happening, they don't care, they put it on the table.
[03:10:46.251 --> 03:10:52.857]  They know the wreck, because in their mind of hubris, they believe that they are playing the role of God.
[03:10:54.963 --> 03:10:57.266]  And when you study elites, they always start thinking they're God.
[03:10:57.507 --> 03:10:58.408]  I don't understand this.
[03:10:59.790 --> 03:11:07.080]  I mean, you know, it certainly, you know, Hitler was insane.
[03:11:07.340 --> 03:11:12.087]  I think anyone who would study Hitler would think that he is insane.
[03:11:13.707 --> 03:11:25.095]  And I would certainly say that the elites of the United States of America today, or really what I would consider the Anglo-American empire, these people are insane.
[03:11:26.001 --> 03:11:27.142]  No, they really are insane.
[03:11:27.803 --> 03:11:31.446]  I mean, they scientifically know what they're doing, but it's crazy.
[03:11:31.466 --> 03:11:36.771]  It's like, okay, you know how to do this, but why are you, I mean, launching sneak attacks on Russia?
[03:11:37.372 --> 03:11:40.415]  And then being so arrogant as to tell the public Russia did it?
[03:11:40.455 --> 03:11:43.938]  I mean, there's new levels of lying, is what I'm saying.
[03:11:44.038 --> 03:11:47.541]  New levels of deception that are just so...
[03:11:50.584 --> 03:11:52.567]  Off the charts, you know, is the word to use.
[03:11:53.468 --> 03:11:54.609]  And God help us.
[03:11:54.649 --> 03:11:56.331]  Well, listen, it was good talking to you, Joe.
[03:11:56.351 --> 03:11:57.292]  I appreciate your input.
[03:11:59.555 --> 03:12:01.698]  Very interesting talking to Joe there from Philly.
[03:12:01.838 --> 03:12:03.300]  Alex in Connecticut, you're on the air.
[03:12:03.320 --> 03:12:03.861]  Go ahead, Alex.
[03:12:06.054 --> 03:12:07.335]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[03:12:07.375 --> 03:12:07.755]  Good, sir.
[03:12:08.435 --> 03:12:18.363]  Good, um, this is a little off topic, but I just want to let you know I've been erring, truth-writing like crazy to prepare, try to get people awake for the coming day here.
[03:12:18.743 --> 03:12:21.145]  So, in your parish on AXS TV?
[03:12:22.006 --> 03:12:25.989]  Oh yeah, over and up, in my town.
[03:12:26.890 --> 03:12:32.374]  But I just found out that, um, I wanted your opinion on this, if I should do this.
[03:12:32.984 --> 03:12:35.425]  They're having like a 9-11 dedication.
[03:12:35.485 --> 03:12:43.927]  I guess one of the people here in my town, their husband died on the World Trade Center, and I saw it's like a gymnasium.
[03:12:44.827 --> 03:12:54.009]  They're rededicating, I guess Joey Rowe's gonna be there, Senator Chris Dodd, Larson's gonna be there, pour all his money into it, and I saw they have a beam on there and everything.
[03:12:54.784 --> 03:12:57.225]  I was wondering, is it a good event to go there?
[03:12:57.245 --> 03:12:58.805]  There's going to be 5,000 people there.
[03:12:58.825 --> 03:13:00.105]  It's open to the public.
[03:13:00.125 --> 03:13:00.346]  Yes.
[03:13:00.526 --> 03:13:03.346]  I just don't know if I should mention, hey, 9-11 is an inside job.
[03:13:03.406 --> 03:13:04.647]  Wear t-shirts and crasses.
[03:13:04.667 --> 03:13:05.587]  This is what you should do.
[03:13:06.567 --> 03:13:14.289]  The media, the controlled corporate Pentagon media, that's what they literally are, with all their fake brands of liberal, conservative, whatever.
[03:13:14.309 --> 03:13:18.410]  They give you different flavors of the Kool-Aid at the Jonestown massacre.
[03:13:19.531 --> 03:13:20.391]  What they do is,
[03:13:22.523 --> 03:13:25.645]  They say the victim's families hate 9-11 truthers.
[03:13:25.725 --> 03:13:26.365]  They're angry.
[03:13:27.266 --> 03:13:34.810]  But then when you talk to 9-11 families, and I've had some of the biggest, in fact I've had the biggest group on their head.
[03:13:34.850 --> 03:13:36.251]  Bill Doyle lost his son Joey.
[03:13:36.592 --> 03:13:40.034]  He said more than half of his members believe it's an inside job.
[03:13:40.494 --> 03:13:41.895]  He believes it's an inside job.
[03:13:41.915 --> 03:13:51.921]  9-11 victims within one year stood around the White House in a ring, several thousand, holding hands saying Bush did it, Bush knew.
[03:13:53.519 --> 03:13:58.360]  And so again, another lie, another hoax that the families get mad, the families get angry.
[03:13:58.440 --> 03:14:19.927]  Now, that said, there is no better way to honor someone who was wrongfully murdered and whose murderers have not been brought to justice than to go to their memorial where you've got evil government and corporate chiefs using their courage, using their murder, using the person that died's image
[03:14:21.138 --> 03:14:48.396]  next to the memorial next to a picture of them to create a motion and while the people are looking at the screen and having or are looking at the stage but they'll also be watching it on TV looking at the screen they will associate those senators those business leaders with the fallen and with the courage of the firefighters and police and emergency workers and so it's a reflected glow they bask in it
[03:14:49.096 --> 03:14:51.080]  When it's their system that committed the attacks.
[03:14:52.843 --> 03:14:55.368]  So that's what Hitler did when he firebombed his own Reichstag.
[03:14:55.388 --> 03:14:57.692]  So it's the same thing over and over again.
[03:14:57.712 --> 03:15:01.259]  So I would burn a bunch of copies of Terror Storm
[03:15:02.668 --> 03:15:08.693]  I think Terror Storm Final Cut, the second edition is what it is, but it's the final cut, is the best 9-11 film out there.
[03:15:09.053 --> 03:15:14.617]  It covers the history of terror and then how they did it on 9-11 and Building 7 and the rest of it and the false start in news reporting.
[03:15:15.298 --> 03:15:20.161]  And then I would go to Kinko's and print up a flyer that just says, you know,
[03:15:21.022 --> 03:15:22.423]  Defend the memory of the victims.
[03:15:22.463 --> 03:15:25.066]  Don't let their loss be used for a police state in wars.
[03:15:25.666 --> 03:15:28.108]  Our government's staged terror attacks more than 200 times.
[03:15:28.188 --> 03:15:28.969]  It's not our government.
[03:15:29.449 --> 03:15:31.331]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:15:31.651 --> 03:15:34.013]  Go watch Terror Storm on Google for free.
[03:15:34.434 --> 03:15:35.354]  Google Terror Storm.
[03:15:36.573 --> 03:15:45.619]  I mean, to make 500 copies of that and to go and hand those out would just cost you, you know, $15, $10, whatever the printer cost at Kinko's or whatever.
[03:15:46.499 --> 03:15:47.820]  So, that's the cheapest thing.
[03:15:48.000 --> 03:15:52.743]  If you have the money and friends, you know, I'd have a backpack and hand them out and I would just be nice.
[03:15:52.783 --> 03:15:53.864]  Hey, check it out.
[03:15:53.904 --> 03:15:54.985]  It deals with the attacks.
[03:15:55.005 --> 03:15:56.846]  It deals with the first responders.
[03:15:57.266 --> 03:15:59.808]  You know, it's for their memory and I would be respectful and nice.
[03:16:00.348 --> 03:16:01.189]  Well, yeah, of course.
[03:16:01.269 --> 03:16:03.050]  I would have a bullhorn in your car, though.
[03:16:03.630 --> 03:16:06.091]  And if they get rude or pushy with you, you pull it out.
[03:16:06.652 --> 03:16:07.452]  But just be careful.
[03:16:12.776 --> 03:16:16.798]  You know, to the corrupt police and corrupt government, it's a sick sacrament of their worship.
[03:16:17.179 --> 03:16:20.060]  They hold out whoever died and said, see, we're heroes.
[03:16:20.420 --> 03:16:22.642]  See, us abusing you is a good thing.
[03:16:22.982 --> 03:16:24.002]  We take care of you.
[03:16:24.042 --> 03:16:25.223]  It's a sick sacrament.
[03:16:25.443 --> 03:16:30.766]  So they get upset by a slave coming to a public event that's to teach you to worship government.
[03:16:31.367 --> 03:16:33.308]  That's a temple of worship to government and evil.
[03:16:33.928 --> 03:16:43.572]  So they don't want you at the temple where they're murdering that person that was killed again and using their death again as a recreation of their supping, their Black Sabbath.
[03:16:45.092 --> 03:16:53.535]  Now, also, if I could, um, the lady, she lives in my town, would it be better to maybe try to get a hold of her before all this happens?
[03:16:53.736 --> 03:16:55.396]  No, they'll probably horn in on you.
[03:16:55.556 --> 03:16:57.177]  Oh, you mean the lady who lost her husband?
[03:16:57.884 --> 03:17:01.326]  Yeah, because I guess she put in a lot of money into the gymnasium, too.
[03:17:01.867 --> 03:17:06.510]  And then, I guess, Roger O'Derell and Larson and all them, they put a lot of money into it.
[03:17:06.530 --> 03:17:07.030]  No, they might.
[03:17:07.090 --> 03:17:08.291]  I don't know why.
[03:17:08.471 --> 03:17:09.672]  Listen, they might flip out on you.
[03:17:09.732 --> 03:17:10.753]  It's your First Amendment right.
[03:17:10.793 --> 03:17:11.614]  It's open to the public.
[03:17:12.274 --> 03:17:17.398]  Just go and say, hey, information, information, information about those who were killed and bring a note, you know.
[03:17:17.438 --> 03:17:24.463]  And if they ask you, say, I'm here to ask why Bin Laden hasn't been indicted for this, but he has for the USS Cole.
[03:17:25.143 --> 03:17:31.167]  And the Tanzanian bombings, you know, and just say, interesting information, oh yeah, and they say, no solicitation.
[03:17:31.427 --> 03:17:33.088]  Say, it's not, it's my First Amendment.
[03:17:33.648 --> 03:17:48.118]  And then if it's some little petty bureaucrat, you know, who's totally bought into the lie, their subconscious knows the truth, totally freaked out, so they burrow into the lie even more, and they're wanting to start a fight with you, and then they shove you or something, come on, do something so we can kill you!
[03:17:48.318 --> 03:17:50.399]  And the cops are behind them, do something so we can get you!
[03:17:50.419 --> 03:17:51.580]  We're just waiting!
[03:17:52.020 --> 03:17:52.981]  Yeah, I thought it was kind of funny.
[03:17:53.001 --> 03:17:55.962]  Jody's actually in the film clandestinely next to Arnold.
[03:17:55.982 --> 03:17:56.363]  I was like, whoa!
[03:18:07.766 --> 03:18:10.889]  Yeah, Truth Rising where Schwarzenegger gets confronted.
[03:18:10.969 --> 03:18:11.790]  Thank you so much.
[03:18:12.110 --> 03:18:13.911]  Yeah, Truth Rising is such an amazing film, folks.
[03:18:13.951 --> 03:18:14.432]  You've got to get it.
[03:18:14.692 --> 03:18:18.035]  I'm going to go to a call right now and then we'll go over into the break with that caller.
[03:18:18.695 --> 03:18:19.516]  That was Alex.
[03:18:19.776 --> 03:18:21.017]  Richard in Texas.
[03:18:21.037 --> 03:18:21.938]  You're on the air, Richard.
[03:18:23.599 --> 03:18:23.759]  Hello.
[03:18:24.500 --> 03:18:25.161]  Hello, Richard.
[03:18:25.881 --> 03:18:26.282]  How's it going?
[03:18:26.542 --> 03:18:26.762]  Good.
[03:18:27.242 --> 03:18:29.424]  Back to the weapons that we have.
[03:18:30.025 --> 03:18:31.606]  There's a weapon called the Mayhem.
[03:18:32.202 --> 03:18:48.691]  M-A-H-E-M, which is an acronym for Magneto Hydrodynamic Explosive Munition, which is, uh, they put it in a plane, basically, and it's this huge, uh, I just typed it, I just typed in weapons, uh... That's the one that sucks the air out of your lungs?
[03:18:49.491 --> 03:18:55.374]  I think so, yeah, it was a huge description, along with the... It's a fuel air bomb, yeah, yeah, but see, that's not secret.
[03:18:55.394 --> 03:18:57.815]  You know, they're saying it's a secret super weapon.
[03:18:58.696 --> 03:18:58.756]  Ah.
[03:18:59.522 --> 03:19:06.886]  Well, another thing, I sent a couple links to you on your MySpace of Russia building pyramids.
[03:19:07.706 --> 03:19:14.690]  They say the secret power of pyramids is to make people less harmful and less agitated, and they're building pyramids all over Russia.
[03:19:15.690 --> 03:19:16.891]  They've done scientific studies.
[03:19:18.272 --> 03:19:21.793]  Also, they have a lot... No, no, all these governments are into the occult.
[03:19:21.894 --> 03:19:22.574]  I have seen that.
[03:19:22.594 --> 03:19:25.055]  The government's building pyramids and having massive breeding programs.
[03:19:25.355 --> 03:19:25.675]  Stay there.
[03:19:25.695 --> 03:19:26.676]  We're going to keep talking right now.
[03:19:26.716 --> 03:19:27.937]  Behind the scenes at InfoWars.com.
[03:19:30.842 --> 03:19:34.806]  Okay, continue with what you were saying there, Richard.
[03:19:35.106 --> 03:19:46.697]  Also, there's a video on, I saw it on Russia Today in the newspaper there, but a video of a Georgian troop firing on all the houses.
[03:19:46.917 --> 03:19:47.958]  Yeah, I've seen it.
[03:19:47.978 --> 03:19:48.799]  We posted it.
[03:19:49.599 --> 03:19:50.480]  Oh, awesome.
[03:19:50.500 --> 03:19:52.182]  But I'm just backing you up that I've seen the video.
[03:19:52.222 --> 03:19:55.224]  I wasn't like, I've seen that, yeah, so what?
[03:19:55.425 --> 03:19:56.586]  I'm just saying I agree with you, yeah.
[03:19:57.475 --> 03:19:59.317]  Yeah, and there's something else.
[03:19:59.417 --> 03:20:02.640]  Oh, the street named after President Bush in Georgia.
[03:20:02.660 --> 03:20:05.483]  Are you kidding?
[03:20:05.523 --> 03:20:08.946]  They have giant pictures of him on buildings there.
[03:20:08.986 --> 03:20:10.187]  Same thing in Albania.
[03:20:11.528 --> 03:20:13.190]  Just totally brainwashed slaves.
[03:20:13.230 --> 03:20:13.690]  They love it.
[03:20:14.471 --> 03:20:16.393]  I love the show, Alex, man.
[03:20:17.354 --> 03:20:18.275]  Prison Planet TV, too.
[03:20:18.315 --> 03:20:18.915]  New viewer there.
[03:20:18.955 --> 03:20:19.496]  It's excellent.
[03:20:19.881 --> 03:20:20.642]  Thank you, my friend.
[03:20:20.662 --> 03:20:22.184]  Appreciate the support.
[03:20:22.264 --> 03:20:28.110]  Yeah, PrisonPlanet.tv, Fabled Enemies, also my new film, Truth Rising, up there right now, folks.
[03:20:29.171 --> 03:20:35.358]  If you're an activist, you can go there and burn DVD copies, you know, to discs that play on most DVD players and hand those out.
[03:20:35.939 --> 03:20:38.302]  And just tell them, if it doesn't blow on your DVD player, it'll blow on your computer.
[03:20:38.802 --> 03:20:39.543]  Key information.
[03:20:39.583 --> 03:20:39.984]  Tell them.
[03:20:41.235 --> 03:20:43.016]  Shocking info.
[03:20:43.036 --> 03:20:44.517]  Tell them, this fights Al-Qaeda.
[03:20:44.837 --> 03:20:45.597]  Fight Al-Qaeda.
[03:20:45.637 --> 03:20:45.997]  Fight Al-Qaeda.
[03:20:46.017 --> 03:20:46.397]  And it will.
[03:20:46.417 --> 03:20:47.698]  It will expose Al-Qaeda.
[03:20:48.498 --> 03:20:50.359]  So say, hey, this video is about fighting Al-Qaeda.
[03:20:50.740 --> 03:20:55.602]  You know, if you've got neocons, they'll go, oh, good, I fought Al-Qaeda.
[03:20:55.642 --> 03:20:58.383]  Let's go ahead and, it's true, they'll be fighting their bosses.
[03:20:58.643 --> 03:21:00.204]  They'll learn how their bosses did it and run Al-Qaeda.
[03:21:01.184 --> 03:21:03.986]  Let's go ahead and talk to Helen in Florida.
[03:21:04.006 --> 03:21:06.367]  Helen, thank you for holding her on the air worldwide.
[03:21:06.820 --> 03:21:07.320]  Yes, Alex.
[03:21:07.721 --> 03:21:14.226]  First of all, everybody's born to divine ingrained instincts and seek truth and goodness, your will and your intellect.
[03:21:14.707 --> 03:21:22.774]  But then the real problem is, and Peter Spensky says in the Church of McAnim, all of man's problems rise with dualities, ego versus his soul.
[03:21:23.354 --> 03:21:25.196]  So even Hitler, his ego took over.
[03:21:25.576 --> 03:21:34.144]  But another important good point I want to hear, I heard last evening, that Collins Montana said that Ron Paul is on the ballot,
[03:21:34.605 --> 03:21:40.567]  Because I guess Bob Barr and others, the lesser parties, are getting together to put Ron Paul on the ballot.
[03:21:41.087 --> 03:21:45.508]  And I talked to a gentleman today from Minnesota, and he said he wrote in Ron Paul.
[03:21:45.548 --> 03:21:47.649]  I'm glad you bring this up, and I appreciate your call.
[03:21:48.309 --> 03:21:55.871]  There is a big announcement supposedly coming from Bob Barr, Chuck Baldwin, and Ron Paul tomorrow.
[03:21:56.992 --> 03:22:00.633]  And Ron Paul said he would not run unless it was on a Republican ticket.
[03:22:02.178 --> 03:22:05.840]  But is Chuck Baldwin going to step down tomorrow?
[03:22:05.860 --> 03:22:06.660]  I meant to get to this.
[03:22:07.020 --> 03:22:09.261]  We need an article about this on InfoWars.com.
[03:22:11.242 --> 03:22:13.283]  Is Chuck Baldwin going to step down?
[03:22:15.420 --> 03:22:18.244]  Is Chuck Baldwin going to step down?
[03:22:18.264 --> 03:22:20.646]  Will his VP be Ron Paul?
[03:22:35.102 --> 03:22:39.004]  It could be they're announcing that Ron Paul will be, could be a stunt, you know.
[03:22:39.344 --> 03:22:43.106]  Ron Paul will be an advisor to the campaign.
[03:22:43.186 --> 03:22:52.511]  Ron Paul is throwing the Ron Paul revolution support behind the Bob Barr, Chuck Baldwin campaign.
[03:22:53.451 --> 03:22:56.013]  Ron Paul is going to be in the cabinet
[03:22:56.755 --> 03:23:11.523]  Which is really the same thing as saying he's throwing his support behind, that he will be in the Cabinet, or he will be Treasury Secretary, or he will be Secretary of Defense, or something, if Chuck Baldwin and Bob Barr win.
[03:23:11.563 --> 03:23:13.805]  I mean, that's probably what you're going to hear.
[03:23:14.285 --> 03:23:17.347]  It is going to be a bombshell off the charts.
[03:23:18.107 --> 03:23:23.210]  If they announce that Chuck Baldwin's stepping down and that Ron Paul is going to be running with him.
[03:23:23.490 --> 03:23:25.831]  In fact, let me just plug them to the full audience that real quick.
[03:23:25.851 --> 03:23:26.672]  We'll go to some more calls.
[03:23:26.712 --> 03:23:27.112]  Stay with us.
[03:23:35.817 --> 03:23:55.761]  Yeah, I meant to get to this.
[03:23:55.801 --> 03:24:02.262]  Ron Paul's supposed to make some huge announcement tomorrow with Chuck Baldwin and the CIA guy Bob Barr.
[03:24:05.710 --> 03:24:06.831]  Please help us, buddies.
[03:24:06.851 --> 03:24:08.432]  It doesn't matter.
[03:24:08.933 --> 03:24:12.796]  I tell you, next to McCain and Obama, though, Bob Barr would be better.
[03:24:13.697 --> 03:24:23.244]  But let us not forget he's a pretty sneaky creature and has been on this show many times and has been refusing to come on the last few months with his presidential run because we want to grill Bob Barr here.
[03:24:23.665 --> 03:24:28.649]  But some are saying that Ron Paul is going to be running VP with Bob Barr and that Baldwin is stepping down.
[03:24:29.890 --> 03:24:30.711]  I wouldn't look for that.
[03:24:30.771 --> 03:24:34.494]  I would look for the announcement that the Ron Paul revolution is throwing its weight
[03:24:35.808 --> 03:24:46.672]  Behind Bob Barr and Chuck Baldwin and that he's gonna, Ron Paul's gonna ask the revolution to get behind them and that Ron Paul will be part of the cabinet when they're elected.
[03:24:47.172 --> 03:24:50.013]  Now I'm predicting that will be the big announcement tomorrow.
[03:24:50.033 --> 03:24:51.213]  I have no inside knowledge.
[03:24:51.793 --> 03:24:53.594]  I heard about this, something about this last week.
[03:24:53.634 --> 03:24:54.554]  They had some big announcement.
[03:24:54.594 --> 03:24:57.895]  I didn't even bother to call them because frankly we'll find out when it's announced.
[03:24:57.955 --> 03:24:59.016]  I don't have time for such things.
[03:24:59.036 --> 03:25:01.857]  I don't revel in knowing something others don't know.
[03:25:02.897 --> 03:25:06.399]  Because I want to know it to tell people.
[03:25:06.460 --> 03:25:08.521]  So what's the point of me knowing without other people knowing?
[03:25:09.421 --> 03:25:10.262]  I'm sure they'd tell me.
[03:25:10.282 --> 03:25:11.263]  They told me lots of stuff.
[03:25:11.323 --> 03:25:15.045]  But the point is that we'll find out tomorrow.
[03:25:15.705 --> 03:25:20.829]  And we need a little blurb up on InfoWars or Prison Planet about, hey, big announcement tomorrow.
[03:25:20.949 --> 03:25:22.230]  Alex thinks it's going to be this.
[03:25:22.850 --> 03:25:25.592]  But it could be that Ron Paul's running for president or vice president.
[03:25:26.414 --> 03:25:31.316]  That's an important discussion and a little blurblet, little churblet up on the site.
[03:25:31.776 --> 03:25:34.597]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[03:25:36.697 --> 03:25:38.638]  What's so many calls coming in?
[03:25:38.678 --> 03:25:39.778]  I can't keep track of all these.
[03:25:40.919 --> 03:25:43.480]  Let's go ahead and talk to Misty in North Carolina.
[03:25:43.860 --> 03:25:44.360]  You're on the air.
[03:25:44.380 --> 03:25:45.060]  She just dropped off.
[03:25:45.080 --> 03:25:45.960]  She just dropped off.
[03:25:46.040 --> 03:25:47.761]  Okay, Eddie and Callie.
[03:25:49.102 --> 03:25:49.702]  Hey Alex.
[03:25:50.222 --> 03:25:50.862]  Hey, how you doing?
[03:25:51.762 --> 03:25:52.883]  I'm good, I'm good.
[03:25:54.002 --> 03:26:10.315]  I just wanted to talk to you about... I was in the Navy, and when I found out what was going on, I actually asked my captain if he could let me out, and he said, sure, you're a smart guy, and he actually signed me off the ship, honorable discharge.
[03:26:11.516 --> 03:26:22.064]  And the things that we have in the military, I mean, people don't believe it, but
[03:26:23.089 --> 03:26:27.472]  They have a lot of stuff for years and years that they don't make public.
[03:26:28.053 --> 03:26:36.399]  I know the Master at Arms, so I had high-level clearance and I was actually able to see some of these things and know about them.
[03:26:37.020 --> 03:26:48.148]  And since Vietnam, they've had cameras that could pretty much tell what color your eyes are, and it's really amazing.
[03:26:48.547 --> 03:26:56.673]  To me, no one would think that our military would be able to even find someone who's hiding in a cave with all the stuff they have.
[03:26:56.913 --> 03:27:01.636]  You're saying, tell what color their eyes are when in the dark or through walls?
[03:27:02.957 --> 03:27:05.699]  Well, I know that from high altitudes.
[03:27:07.147 --> 03:27:23.380]  Um, but they've had... Well, well, well, they admit they have live feed digital satellites, which, which, which, which, which, which the ground cameras track how you walk, and then that's uploaded, and then from above, with that and your shadow, they know it's you.
[03:27:23.400 --> 03:27:26.762]  And that may be one of the secret weapons they're using, but go ahead.
[03:27:27.423 --> 03:27:30.125]  Absolutely, we've had it since Vietnam.
[03:27:30.165 --> 03:27:34.428]  My grandfather was on the flight crew in the Navy in Vietnam.
[03:27:35.032 --> 03:27:37.974]  And he actually did fly over as reconnaissance.
[03:27:38.735 --> 03:27:46.660]  Well, the moral is, though, if the people know how to shoot straight, and the people fight back, all those superweapons won't even help them.
[03:27:46.740 --> 03:27:47.540]  I appreciate your call.
[03:27:48.381 --> 03:27:49.962]  Let's go ahead and take another one here.
[03:27:50.662 --> 03:27:51.503]  Who's up next here?
[03:27:51.543 --> 03:27:52.424]  There's so many of these.
[03:27:52.464 --> 03:27:53.344]  Jeremy in Arkansas.
[03:27:53.364 --> 03:27:54.345]  Jeremy in Arkansas.
[03:27:54.365 --> 03:27:54.725]  Go ahead.
[03:27:55.386 --> 03:27:56.766]  Hey, Alex.
[03:27:56.827 --> 03:27:57.347]  Hey, how you doing?
[03:27:58.007 --> 03:27:59.728]  Hey, I have a question for you.
[03:28:00.289 --> 03:28:01.530]  I always thought it was strange that
[03:28:02.481 --> 03:28:09.470]  One of the 9-11 Commission members was, at the time, she was a member of, she was the vice chairman of the Fannie Mae, Jamie Gorelick I believe is her name?
[03:28:09.650 --> 03:28:09.950]  Yeah.
[03:28:10.531 --> 03:28:11.632]  Which one of you thought about that?
[03:28:13.206 --> 03:28:15.147]  Well, I mean, it's just all a pack of crooks.
[03:28:16.688 --> 03:28:26.934]  Katherine Austin Fitts was one of the high-level people at HUD with Clinton, and she went public saying it was a huge money laundering scam five, six years ago, and you've got to give credit where credit's due.
[03:28:27.414 --> 03:28:28.875]  Mike Rupert was right about all this.
[03:28:28.915 --> 03:28:40.261]  He said, like, five years ago that Freddie and Fannie were going to collapse and it was all a big scam and that they were selling junk and that it was all a big fraud, and he's right.
[03:28:40.281 --> 03:28:41.562]  You've got to give credit where credit's due.
[03:28:42.580 --> 03:28:44.142]  So they were ahead of the curve on that.
[03:28:44.743 --> 03:28:44.943]  Hmm.
[03:28:45.284 --> 03:28:45.404]  Okay.
[03:28:45.444 --> 03:28:47.286]  I appreciate it.
[03:28:47.727 --> 03:28:48.768]  Hey, I appreciate you.
[03:28:48.788 --> 03:28:49.770]  You bet.
[03:28:52.196 --> 03:28:54.637]  Yeah, I think Mike Rupert's an example of ego.
[03:28:54.657 --> 03:28:56.738]  I mean, we really built him up.
[03:28:56.939 --> 03:28:57.559]  Great guest.
[03:28:57.619 --> 03:28:58.499]  Really smart guy.
[03:28:58.900 --> 03:29:00.040]  He got really popular.
[03:29:00.100 --> 03:29:01.361]  Went to his head and he went crazy.
[03:29:01.381 --> 03:29:03.622]  Started attacking me, everybody else.
[03:29:03.642 --> 03:29:04.983]  And it was just sad.
[03:29:05.023 --> 03:29:05.763]  I wasn't pleased.
[03:29:05.823 --> 03:29:08.585]  Like, oh, competition's down.
[03:29:08.685 --> 03:29:09.285]  Oh, great.
[03:29:09.445 --> 03:29:12.367]  No, I'm like, man, that was a talented, smart guy.
[03:29:12.407 --> 03:29:13.808]  Too bad he went bonkers, you know?
[03:29:14.568 --> 03:29:15.408]  Or whatever he went.
[03:29:16.249 --> 03:29:17.349]  Off the reservation, he quit.
[03:29:18.769 --> 03:29:19.991]  Uh, you know, Mike's a good guy.
[03:29:20.171 --> 03:29:21.072]  We're on the march.
[03:29:21.572 --> 03:29:23.154]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:24.095 --> 03:29:29.282]  Alex Jones and the GCN... Or whatever he went, uh, off the reservation, he quit.
[03:29:29.502 --> 03:29:31.905]  Uh, you know, Mike's a good guy.
[03:29:32.025 --> 03:29:32.926]  We're on the march.
[03:29:33.426 --> 03:29:35.008]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:35.949 --> 03:29:38.653]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:42.040 --> 03:29:48.444]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:29:48.804 --> 03:29:50.766]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:29:51.446 --> 03:29:52.467]  But who is the enemy?
[03:29:52.987 --> 03:29:53.507]  Bin Laden.
[03:29:53.787 --> 03:29:54.608]  This is his MO.
[03:29:54.668 --> 03:29:56.149]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:29:56.169 --> 03:29:57.770]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:29:58.150 --> 03:30:04.895]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:30:05.295 --> 03:30:05.735]  Some U.S.
[03:30:05.775 --> 03:30:11.559]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:30:12.140 --> 03:30:15.622]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:30:15.642 --> 03:30:25.889]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[03:30:26.129 --> 03:30:26.850]  Fabled Enemies.

[03:30:41.775 --> 03:30:44.839]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[03:30:45.220 --> 03:30:47.282]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[03:30:47.523 --> 03:30:50.526]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[03:30:50.827 --> 03:30:57.315]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[03:30:57.716 --> 03:30:59.839]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[03:31:00.319 --> 03:31:03.381]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[03:31:03.601 --> 03:31:08.245]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[03:31:08.405 --> 03:31:12.127]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[03:31:12.327 --> 03:31:13.868]  Travel less, meet online.

[03:31:41.762 --> 03:31:43.143]  Wake up, Protestant America!
[03:31:43.363 --> 03:31:46.885]  There is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state.
[03:31:47.045 --> 03:31:52.969]  This confederation of evangelicals, Catholics, and Protestant denominations will form one huge political voting block.
[03:31:53.089 --> 03:31:56.852]  Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation.
[03:31:57.172 --> 03:32:01.655]  Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom, liberty of conscience.
[03:32:01.915 --> 03:32:06.397]  History and the Bible prove to them that these two systems, church and state, must be kept separate.
[03:32:06.598 --> 03:32:10.300]  It must be our love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us.
[03:32:10.640 --> 03:32:13.042]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement.
[03:32:13.242 --> 03:32:18.347]  From history we saw that when church and state united, known as Papal Rome, religious intolerance resulted.
[03:32:18.547 --> 03:32:21.930]  This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation.
[03:32:22.210 --> 03:32:24.853]  America and Papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[03:32:24.993 --> 03:32:27.535]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late.
[03:32:27.775 --> 03:32:29.457]  The prophecies are fast fulfilling.
[03:32:29.697 --> 03:32:31.038]  Jesus is coming soon!

[03:32:34.539 --> 03:32:36.459]  UFC Ultimate Fighting Champion Tanner dead at 37.
[03:33:00.663 --> 03:33:07.669]  He went on a desert expedition by himself, a cleansing, and died in the desert.
[03:33:09.571 --> 03:33:10.352]  See, that's hubris.
[03:33:10.532 --> 03:33:11.933]  I'm not saying the guy's a bad person.
[03:33:12.654 --> 03:33:23.204]  My point is, big, tough, smart guy, and it sounds interesting to me to go into the desert, but it was 114 during the day, 50 degrees at night, he died.
[03:33:25.578 --> 03:33:25.998]  He died.
[03:33:26.979 --> 03:33:29.362]  And it's the same thing with so many other people I know.
[03:33:29.382 --> 03:33:36.088]  As I get more power, and again this is a tiny planet in the middle of the universe, the whole planet really is nothing.
[03:33:36.828 --> 03:33:40.552]  I see myself as like a little butterfly or a mouse or something.
[03:33:41.993 --> 03:33:48.139]  I'm into the species, I'm into the universe, I'm into what we can build, our potential, but individually
[03:33:51.551 --> 03:33:54.773]  I have never been that arrogant or on a power trip.
[03:33:54.954 --> 03:33:56.675]  I've always realized that I'm weak.
[03:33:57.275 --> 03:33:59.197]  I've always realized that I'm not that smart.
[03:33:59.817 --> 03:34:03.780]  I've always realized that I always underestimated myself.
[03:34:03.800 --> 03:34:08.403]  I don't want to talk about myself individually, but it's a journey we all have, so I can only talk about myself.
[03:34:09.124 --> 03:34:12.726]  I remember being in high school and kind of having the idea that people didn't like me.
[03:34:15.128 --> 03:34:20.512]  Then later I read my yearbooks when I was in Dallas, and then I talked to people, you
[03:34:22.977 --> 03:34:25.218]  You were like the most popular person in school.
[03:34:25.238 --> 03:34:34.301]  I was like the James Dean rebel, getting in fights and partying and being wild and everything else.
[03:34:35.961 --> 03:34:38.162]  My point is that I don't have that big of an ego.
[03:34:41.903 --> 03:34:46.545]  And people say, well it sure sounds like that when you're arrogant and aggressive and go up and bullhorn national television.
[03:34:46.605 --> 03:34:47.485]  No, no, no.
[03:34:47.505 --> 03:34:48.785]  That's mission-oriented.
[03:34:48.825 --> 03:34:50.686]  I mean, don't think that I won't get in your face.
[03:34:50.746 --> 03:34:51.466]  I'm not aggressive.
[03:34:51.806 --> 03:34:52.487]  But that's different.
[03:34:52.547 --> 03:34:58.108]  That's more of a survival instinct.
[03:34:58.229 --> 03:35:00.149]  But see, I wouldn't go into the desert by myself.
[03:35:00.609 --> 03:35:04.451]  Doesn't mean that I don't think I could maybe make it or that I'd be alright.
[03:35:04.991 --> 03:35:06.351]  It's just I know it's tempting fate.
[03:35:07.432 --> 03:35:09.292]  And I don't have that much confidence in myself.
[03:35:13.919 --> 03:35:15.779]  I don't even know why I'm going off on this jag.
[03:35:18.460 --> 03:35:27.781]  I've had so many people I've worked with and been around, people in the Patriot Movement, not the great listeners, the best folks in the world, but people that come to this because they want power and they are ego.
[03:35:28.241 --> 03:35:34.502]  As soon as they get a little bit of an audience or a little bit of a website, they suddenly attack me, everybody else, they kind of go wild.
[03:35:35.903 --> 03:35:36.963]  And I see that in business.
[03:35:37.023 --> 03:35:40.343]  People have a little bit of early success and then they just think they've got it.
[03:35:40.363 --> 03:35:41.224]  They think they're magic.
[03:35:42.484 --> 03:35:43.144]  Overconfident.
[03:35:44.701 --> 03:35:46.242]  You don't want to be overconfident, folks.
[03:35:47.743 --> 03:35:50.386]  You don't want to be overconfident in this fight against the New World Order.
[03:35:50.986 --> 03:36:05.518]  I mean, that's why I tell you how bad it really is, so we can get people who are rationalizing, or saying, oh, it'll be alright, or, oh, it's not real, to really listen and go, no, this is serious, and this is dangerous, and you better pay attention.
[03:36:07.860 --> 03:36:08.540]  You've been warned.
[03:36:08.580 --> 03:36:09.621]  This is at your own peril.
[03:36:11.883 --> 03:36:12.643]  I've digressed.
[03:36:20.379 --> 03:36:37.774]  I just see so many good old boys that are so arrogant, so full of themselves, nobody can mess with them, they're the tough guy, they stick their chest out at people at bars and on the street, and with their wife or girlfriends looking up at them, and they're just kind of this delusional fruitcake lamb, but then some cop pulls that guy over and he pees in his pants.
[03:36:41.558 --> 03:36:44.160]  Or they get a letter from the IRS and they have a heart attack.
[03:36:46.479 --> 03:36:52.344]  You know, it's moral courage is what we need, and courage on real issues and real missions.
[03:36:53.966 --> 03:36:59.351]  Not just walking around like you see a lot of these men, just like... And they're actually delusional.
[03:37:00.192 --> 03:37:04.476]  It's like a five-year-old imagining they're a space captain, or Darth Vader.
[03:37:04.496 --> 03:37:08.739]  You know, see a five-year-old going... and they're acting tough and really getting into it.
[03:37:09.100 --> 03:37:10.181]  I see adults like that.
[03:37:12.406 --> 03:37:20.351]  I was like, if you really were a badass and you've been in a bunch of fights, you know how bad it is to get your butt kicked and then on any given day you run into the wrong person, you'll end up in the hospital.
[03:37:20.592 --> 03:37:22.893]  If you were so tough, you wouldn't be walking around acting like that.
[03:37:23.514 --> 03:37:28.597]  The really tough guys are people who try to stay out of the way and don't want to be bothered by people and are very friendly.
[03:37:29.718 --> 03:37:34.161]  And again, that's an expression of the government, the police, the military, everybody else.
[03:37:34.841 --> 03:37:39.685]  They just, they aren't connecting with reality and they think they're bulletproof.
[03:37:40.165 --> 03:37:41.566]  And folks, none of us are bulletproof.
[03:37:43.021 --> 03:37:51.066]  Another thing is, a million plus children are kidnapped every year.
[03:37:51.126 --> 03:37:55.148]  If I went over the crimes of the CPS, it would dwarf anything you could really imagine.
[03:37:55.709 --> 03:37:57.710]  It's hard for me to grasp it.
[03:38:01.016 --> 03:38:03.858]  14 sports stadiums filled with 100,000 people apiece.
[03:38:04.699 --> 03:38:11.166]  That's how many children, according to the Department of Justice, are grabbed by Child Protective Services.
[03:38:11.186 --> 03:38:14.929]  1.4 million.
[03:38:14.949 --> 03:38:19.274]  14 of the biggest sports stadiums filled every year.
[03:38:20.902 --> 03:38:24.923]  No due process, no judge, no jury, no indictment, no claims.
[03:38:25.343 --> 03:38:29.264]  They find ignorant parents that are trusting in the government going, well, we didn't do nothing.
[03:38:29.284 --> 03:38:32.986]  Yeah, we'll sign agreements that you can oversee us and we've done some wrong.
[03:38:33.026 --> 03:38:35.666]  If that makes us... Oh, you're taking my child?
[03:38:35.706 --> 03:38:36.026]  Well, what?
[03:38:36.106 --> 03:38:37.067]  I didn't know...
[03:38:38.257 --> 03:38:40.139]  Folks, your child gets bitten by a dog.
[03:38:40.759 --> 03:38:41.540]  Happened to all of us.
[03:38:41.600 --> 03:38:43.382]  I was bit by neighborhood dogs over and over again.
[03:38:43.662 --> 03:38:44.923]  Probably ten times growing up.
[03:38:45.543 --> 03:38:47.425]  Run up, bite you on the butt, bite you on the leg.
[03:38:47.725 --> 03:38:50.448]  Sheepdog run up, you know, you bite you on the hand.
[03:38:50.468 --> 03:38:52.430]  You go ahead and kick it upside the head and it runs off.
[03:38:52.470 --> 03:38:55.592]  I mean, Paul, you ever been bit by a dog?
[03:38:56.373 --> 03:38:56.873]  How many times?
[03:38:57.934 --> 03:38:58.355]  Once, okay.
[03:39:00.359 --> 03:39:03.120]  One time I had this big, fat chihuahua that my buddy had.
[03:39:03.140 --> 03:39:04.800]  And it was always growling at me at his house.
[03:39:04.840 --> 03:39:06.421]  And finally, I was wearing shorts one day over there.
[03:39:06.441 --> 03:39:07.121]  I was like 14.
[03:39:07.181 --> 03:39:09.421]  It just bit a huge chunk out of the back of my leg.
[03:39:10.101 --> 03:39:10.822]  Little bastard.
[03:39:13.102 --> 03:39:16.003]  Anyways, the point is, that happens.
[03:39:16.343 --> 03:39:17.503]  CPS is going to take a kid.
[03:39:17.523 --> 03:39:19.224]  They're going to try.
[03:39:19.284 --> 03:39:23.265]  When you go in to have a baby, and they ask the husband, will you drop this form downstairs for me?
[03:39:23.485 --> 03:39:25.125]  They ask your wife, you got enough money at home?
[03:39:25.785 --> 03:39:26.225]  You doing well?
[03:39:26.245 --> 03:39:27.166]  You guys ever argue?
[03:39:27.626 --> 03:39:28.526]  Boom, your kids are gone.
[03:39:30.691 --> 03:39:33.232]  You need to know that this is a criminal prison grid.
[03:39:33.552 --> 03:39:35.792]  The schools, the school counselors, all of it.
[03:39:36.073 --> 03:39:37.653]  It's all meant to break your family up.
[03:39:37.673 --> 03:39:39.393]  The government believes a family is a disease.
[03:39:40.854 --> 03:39:43.674]  They've got over two-thirds of foster children on psychotropic drugs.
[03:39:43.714 --> 03:39:45.555]  They say it's because they have bad genes.
[03:39:45.595 --> 03:39:46.335]  That's in Endgame.
[03:39:48.116 --> 03:39:52.037]  For the next twenty minutes, I want to bring... I can't go into overdrive.
[03:39:52.077 --> 03:39:53.097]  I'm on some British radio.
[03:39:54.195 --> 03:40:00.979]  I want to get over all these calls everybody else is holding, but the point is, this is real, it's happening, and go out there on your own peril.
[03:40:01.399 --> 03:40:03.380]  Billboards aren't going to tell you about the danger.
[03:40:03.981 --> 03:40:09.644]  Public service announcements in between the CIA announcing they're working with their local government, you know, that's not going to save you.
[03:40:11.025 --> 03:40:13.747]  Everybody's been learned to be gelded, to cower to government.
[03:40:14.687 --> 03:40:17.289]  You have pedophile rings that run the CPS on average.
[03:40:17.589 --> 03:40:21.111]  They were set up over a hundred years ago as eugenics cores.
[03:40:21.411 --> 03:40:22.432]  I have all that in endgame.
[03:40:23.553 --> 03:40:25.234]  And, uh, that's who they are.
[03:40:26.354 --> 03:40:30.156]  They set up separate eugenics courts about a hundred years ago in this country.
[03:40:31.557 --> 03:40:36.779]  They sterilized over 500,000 people, euthanized hundreds of thousands of newborn babies and children.
[03:40:36.799 --> 03:40:38.780]  You know, they murder babies in this country.
[03:40:40.440 --> 03:40:42.441]  They should just take them and drown them or kill them right there.
[03:40:42.481 --> 03:40:46.303]  They take the poor woman's baby, something's wrong with your baby, you know, just, oh, baby died.
[03:40:47.763 --> 03:40:49.124]  Death warrant signed by the judge.
[03:40:49.144 --> 03:40:51.225]  You didn't know about that, Paul?
[03:40:54.039 --> 03:41:03.847]  Yeah, type in 35 states for sterilization laws, or US for sterilization laws, and then just kind of footnote it in there as they also like to kill the babies.
[03:41:04.507 --> 03:41:16.898]  Now, this same pack of scum has now metastasized, and the last three major directors of the CPS in Florida, or family services there, have been caught to be pedophile ring runners.
[03:41:19.340 --> 03:41:19.740]  What is it?
[03:41:19.860 --> 03:41:23.383]  Last time I checked, 5,000 plus kids are missing in Florida that the government took.
[03:41:24.659 --> 03:41:25.500]  Oh, you think I'm joking?
[03:41:26.061 --> 03:41:28.784]  Paul's looking at... Do you know about the Texas Youth Commission, Paul?
[03:41:30.446 --> 03:41:31.327]  The big rape rooms?
[03:41:32.128 --> 03:41:32.929]  And selling the kids?
[03:41:32.989 --> 03:41:35.753]  Okay, that's the... Texas Rangers weren't allowed to stop them?
[03:41:35.773 --> 03:41:36.854]  Yeah, that's what we're talking about.
[03:41:37.455 --> 03:41:37.635]  So...
[03:41:38.908 --> 03:41:40.590]  That's the criminals we're talking about.
[03:41:40.650 --> 03:41:45.454]  Now, for speaking out against this, our guest was put in a mental institution for a little while.
[03:41:45.874 --> 03:41:47.115]  Greg Pound's a great guy.
[03:41:47.155 --> 03:41:49.998]  He and his Christian wife, no criminal record, homeschooling.
[03:41:50.438 --> 03:41:51.359]  They black-opted him.
[03:41:51.379 --> 03:41:53.701]  The lady that did it was found guilty of lying about him.
[03:41:53.901 --> 03:41:56.423]  The state says, we don't care if it's not true, you don't get to see your children.
[03:41:57.064 --> 03:42:00.227]  And Greg, I want you to give out your number, your website, for support.
[03:42:00.267 --> 03:42:01.528]  You haven't been on with us in about a year.
[03:42:01.548 --> 03:42:04.330]  I'm going to have you back on as this develops, but in a nutshell,
[03:42:05.071 --> 03:42:11.714]  Tell people what happened to your children, where they are now, and then the latest thing here in the Soviet America.
[03:42:12.715 --> 03:42:13.735]  Okay, Alex, can you hear me?
[03:42:14.175 --> 03:42:15.036]  Yes, Mr. Pound.
[03:42:15.276 --> 03:42:17.657]  Okay, listen, Alex, I want to thank you for your program.
[03:42:17.677 --> 03:42:19.958]  Can I just share something with you?
[03:42:20.338 --> 03:42:21.619]  This is a verse out of the Bible.
[03:42:21.639 --> 03:42:23.359]  This is what it says.
[03:42:23.479 --> 03:42:29.822]  To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness of the truth.
[03:42:30.223 --> 03:42:33.324]  Everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice.
[03:42:34.119 --> 03:42:37.141]  And, you know, I just thank you for your program and speaking the truth.
[03:42:37.161 --> 03:42:38.642]  That's what we need, is the truth.
[03:42:38.682 --> 03:42:45.387]  And sometimes, with what I'm dealing with, with being separated from my wife for two years and not seeing my kids, sometimes it's hard for me to listen to your program.
[03:42:45.407 --> 03:42:48.029]  That's right, your wife had to escape, so they wanted the others.
[03:42:48.370 --> 03:42:49.891]  The child rapers wanted the other ones.
[03:42:50.871 --> 03:42:52.513]  Now, I'm not kidding, the pedophile ring.
[03:42:53.754 --> 03:42:56.416]  In a nutshell, tell folks about what the pedophile rings did to you.
[03:42:57.116 --> 03:43:02.360]  Well, what it is, is they came in, they're filing false police reports to steal people's kids.
[03:43:03.001 --> 03:43:06.783]  And at the bottom line, as we found out, was for federal grant money.
[03:43:06.823 --> 03:43:08.584]  It's the money that's coming in from the Fed.
[03:43:08.764 --> 03:43:09.684]  There's a bounty on them.
[03:43:10.144 --> 03:43:10.625]  Exactly.
[03:43:10.685 --> 03:43:12.366]  There's a bounty on people's children.
[03:43:12.926 --> 03:43:15.527]  And it's just unbelievable how much money they're coming in.
[03:43:15.587 --> 03:43:19.089]  And we believe it's coming from the United Nations because our federal government is broke.
[03:43:19.269 --> 03:43:20.629]  No, no, that's under UNESCO.
[03:43:20.709 --> 03:43:24.191]  It's, absolutely, there's been IMF and World Bank money on the bounty.
[03:43:24.611 --> 03:43:24.911]  Okay.
[03:43:25.292 --> 03:43:27.413]  And so, I mean, so this is what we're dealing with.
[03:43:27.453 --> 03:43:29.294]  We haven't seen our kids now for four years.
[03:43:29.374 --> 03:43:32.155]  My wife's been hiding for two and a half years with our little baby.
[03:43:32.808 --> 03:43:35.631]  And you've already sent, you've already convicted one monster.
[03:43:55.035 --> 03:43:59.217]  People need to realize this is Pinellas County where Terry Schiavo was starved to death.
[03:43:59.437 --> 03:44:05.060]  This is the exact same county where these people think they're gods.
[03:44:05.720 --> 03:44:14.165]  When they can go ahead and kill people and steal people's little children... Bernie McCabe, you can read the... Well, why don't you briefly tell folks how this all started.
[03:44:14.824 --> 03:44:16.845]  Well, it started with an accidental dog bite.
[03:44:17.225 --> 03:44:21.946]  Dog bites are the number one accident among children, as you were talking earlier, and that's what happened.
[03:44:21.986 --> 03:44:23.487]  My daughter accidentally got bit.
[03:44:23.547 --> 03:44:24.207]  My wife called 911.
[03:44:25.347 --> 03:44:33.589]  A case manager comes out, this young girl with a steel rod in her tongue, hair shaved off her head, jet black, and she's out here confiscating people's kids.
[03:44:33.629 --> 03:44:36.050]  Now, she committed 96 third-degree felonies.
[03:44:36.070 --> 03:44:42.212]  She committed 26 degree felonies in filing false police reports, 70 counts of grand theft,
[03:44:42.651 --> 03:44:47.173]  And this is all related to money coming in from the federal government.
[03:44:47.273 --> 03:44:50.574]  And she didn't sit four days or four hours in jail.
[03:44:50.634 --> 03:44:52.035]  But she was convicted of lying.
[03:44:52.315 --> 03:44:53.195]  She was convicted.
[03:44:53.376 --> 03:44:57.337]  Where is this Kerr right now?
[03:44:59.218 --> 03:45:01.099]  Megan Gallagher, I don't know where she went.
[03:45:02.359 --> 03:45:03.580]  She's disappeared.
[03:45:03.660 --> 03:45:07.581]  I just pray that God brings judgment upon her.
[03:45:07.621 --> 03:45:08.622]  Let's pray together right now.
[03:45:08.642 --> 03:45:10.943]  I want you to pray.
[03:45:11.431 --> 03:45:15.053]  Father, we come in the name and through the blood of your Son, our Savior and our Redeemer.
[03:45:15.093 --> 03:45:17.734]  We ask that you'll bring judgment on these evil people, Father.
[03:45:18.215 --> 03:45:23.678]  We ask that you would, Father, bring... You said, we pray that you'd bring them to either repentance or bring them to death.
[03:45:24.238 --> 03:45:31.002]  Give them life or give them death, Father, but we ask that you will bring weight upon them that'll push them down to the place where they cry for mercy.
[03:45:31.442 --> 03:45:32.823]  And we ask these things in Christ's name.
[03:45:33.683 --> 03:45:33.983]  Amen.
[03:45:34.504 --> 03:45:36.505]  And our listeners are all praying that right now.
[03:45:38.379 --> 03:45:42.141]  And I have absolute faith that she will pay today for what she's done.
[03:45:42.401 --> 03:45:45.663]  I know she's already paid in many ways, but she will pay further.
[03:45:46.084 --> 03:45:50.967]  You know, Alex, once you see the judgment that's coming down on these people... Oh, I know.
[03:45:50.987 --> 03:45:51.647]  They're dying.
[03:45:51.667 --> 03:45:52.688]  They're dying in car wrecks.
[03:45:52.988 --> 03:45:53.968]  Their kids are all dying.
[03:45:53.988 --> 03:45:54.609]  I know.
[03:45:54.689 --> 03:45:55.389]  It's real.
[03:45:55.790 --> 03:45:56.070]  It is.
[03:45:56.350 --> 03:45:56.570]  It is.
[03:45:56.630 --> 03:45:57.951]  Our attorney got shot in the head.
[03:45:58.011 --> 03:46:03.754]  The girl who was working with the juvenile court judge, who was doing all this, she was...
[03:46:05.269 --> 03:46:06.571]  Uh, Stacey Plummer.
[03:46:06.591 --> 03:46:07.892]  You can go back and read about it.
[03:46:07.932 --> 03:46:08.993]  I mean, she was our attorney.
[03:46:09.153 --> 03:46:12.816]  I told her, listen, I told her and the judge, I said, there's a guy that judges judges.
[03:46:13.297 --> 03:46:15.519]  And I said, you and, and they ripped us off for our money.
[03:46:16.920 --> 03:46:19.942]  And she ended up getting shot in the head and she's dead now.
[03:46:20.123 --> 03:46:23.646]  I used to see her go by, stand out front of that courthouse every single day.
[03:46:23.906 --> 03:46:25.608]  I've been out there now for going on four years.
[03:46:26.188 --> 03:46:28.270]  And so what happens is now that I'm running for sheriff,
[03:46:28.743 --> 03:46:40.568]  And people, I mean, what they did, this thing, I went to the Republican convention here for McCain, they were having a big party for him, and so I'm a Republican running as an independent for a sheriff in Pinellas County.
[03:46:41.248 --> 03:46:51.813]  And what happens is that I went to this party, and these guys came in like the robo-cops, and undercover, I mean, this is at a Republican party, and this is in the
[03:46:52.498 --> 03:46:55.760]  The sheriff there made a move on me that was just totally insane.
[03:46:55.840 --> 03:46:59.603]  Drug me out of a place where I'm sitting in a big ballroom with 600 other people.
[03:46:59.623 --> 03:47:00.343]  Now let's be clear.
[03:47:00.363 --> 03:47:01.764]  You're running against the sheriff.
[03:47:02.064 --> 03:47:05.086]  Now all the time you hear about sheriffs killing other people running for sheriffs.
[03:47:05.146 --> 03:47:07.128]  I mean, this is America.
[03:47:07.968 --> 03:47:09.209]  And so they even kill each other.
[03:47:09.529 --> 03:47:11.050]  So you're running against him.
[03:47:11.090 --> 03:47:11.991]  He has you grabbed.
[03:47:12.111 --> 03:47:12.912]  What happens next?
[03:47:13.452 --> 03:47:17.455]  Well, the next thing is they drag me out the back door of the Hilton.
[03:47:18.175 --> 03:47:22.258]  And they take all my stuff, everything I had on me, went through my papers.
[03:47:22.916 --> 03:47:23.316]  I think so.
[03:47:41.445 --> 03:47:42.266]  I shouldn't even be here.
[03:47:42.327 --> 03:47:46.353]  If I sign a release form, that means that I'm saying I'm going to come and stand before a judge.
[03:47:46.713 --> 03:47:48.656]  Which is the same thing that happened with your children.
[03:47:48.676 --> 03:47:50.659]  They just go, sign it and everything will be alright.
[03:47:50.739 --> 03:47:52.321]  And they go, I've got your child now.
[03:47:52.562 --> 03:47:57.369]  It's just like in A Little Mermaid, when she says sign the contract, she signs it, and the witch goes, ha ha ha!
[03:47:57.689 --> 03:47:58.790]  Yes!
[03:47:59.931 --> 03:48:12.538]  I mean, this is a criminal government that lies and says it's the law, your children have to take vaccines, and they line up at courthouses everywhere with drug dogs and guys in riot gear injecting thousands of children, and there's not even a law.
[03:48:12.558 --> 03:48:15.820]  I mean, see, the government is totally bankrupt and wicked.
[03:48:15.840 --> 03:48:16.201]  Go ahead.
[03:48:16.881 --> 03:48:18.443]  Well, that's where it's at.
[03:48:18.463 --> 03:48:20.486]  They put me directly into a psych unit.
[03:48:20.787 --> 03:48:22.509]  And this is what they're doing.
[03:48:22.529 --> 03:48:24.071]  Well, you're a crazy person!
[03:48:24.111 --> 03:48:25.433]  You want your children back!
[03:48:25.773 --> 03:48:27.896]  Oh my God, how dare you!
[03:48:27.916 --> 03:48:30.219]  Well, we're not giving up our kids.
[03:48:31.080 --> 03:48:33.283]  How long have the kidnappers had your children?
[03:48:33.544 --> 03:48:34.044]  Four years.
[03:48:34.884 --> 03:48:36.746]  And August 3rd was four years.
[03:48:36.846 --> 03:48:39.008]  And do you know where they have your children?
[03:48:39.368 --> 03:48:39.788]  No, I don't.
[03:48:40.529 --> 03:48:45.513]  Now tell us, these are human beings, so the psychopaths are listening, but some of them are just borderline psychopaths.
[03:48:45.753 --> 03:48:48.716]  So for the scum that's out there, talk about them.
[03:48:48.736 --> 03:48:50.257]  These are human beings they're abusing.
[03:48:50.598 --> 03:48:52.259]  Tell us the children's names.
[03:48:52.639 --> 03:48:56.663]  Okay, Hannah, Isaiah, Joanna, and Susanna.
[03:48:57.222 --> 03:49:00.445]  My son, Isaiah, had no cavities when they took him.
[03:49:00.705 --> 03:49:05.809]  A year and a half after they had him, when he would smile, you'd see six big cavities in his teeth.
[03:49:06.190 --> 03:49:07.251]  It'd just make us cry.
[03:49:07.331 --> 03:49:13.376]  My wife was a dental assistant in an all-children's dental facility, and we would look at our kids and look what they've done to our children.
[03:49:13.416 --> 03:49:14.097]  We would just cry.
[03:49:14.157 --> 03:49:15.057]  We didn't know what else to do.
[03:49:15.598 --> 03:49:20.942]  We would cry like babies, and we just... And I've been at these events with other parents.
[03:49:21.263 --> 03:49:23.605]  The CPS workers just sit there, just like...
[03:49:26.468 --> 03:49:42.098]  The only way we can imagine, that's why we put together the website FreeOurKids.com where we show how they take a nine-year-old boy and torture this kid for three years and he tells the story.
[03:49:42.718 --> 03:49:45.420]  If you get your listeners to watch FreeOurKids.com
[03:49:45.859 --> 03:49:48.359]  And listen to what this nine-year-old boy tells what they did to him.
[03:49:48.379 --> 03:49:49.860]  He gives the names of the people.
[03:49:50.020 --> 03:49:56.721]  Hey, every day, and I'm not looking for it, I find out where new social workers or foster parents have kids locked in cages.
[03:49:56.761 --> 03:49:57.381]  That's standard.
[03:49:57.641 --> 03:49:59.242]  Feed them like one hot dog a day.
[03:49:59.302 --> 03:50:00.322]  They'll starve them to death.
[03:50:00.742 --> 03:50:01.762]  They rape them.
[03:50:01.802 --> 03:50:02.822]  He'll stand there and show you.
[03:50:03.082 --> 03:50:05.063]  The pictures that we have of him, how skinny he was.
[03:50:05.603 --> 03:50:06.823]  It's just unbelievable.
[03:50:07.303 --> 03:50:08.083]  They will pay.
[03:50:08.103 --> 03:50:11.804]  Let me tell you, that's why these people are rotten, unhappy scum.
[03:50:13.211 --> 03:50:14.954]  Let me tell you, God is going to cut you down.
[03:50:14.974 --> 03:50:15.835]  We don't have to do a thing.
[03:50:16.696 --> 03:50:18.359]  You may not believe in God, but we do.
[03:50:18.399 --> 03:50:19.721]  And let me tell you something, trash.
[03:50:19.761 --> 03:50:20.743]  You rape what you sow.
[03:50:22.585 --> 03:50:23.567]  Absolute filth.
[03:50:23.667 --> 03:50:24.188]  Stay there.
[03:50:24.208 --> 03:50:25.910]  I'm going to talk behind the scenes with our guest.
[03:50:30.538 --> 03:50:31.579]  Alright, let's continue.
[03:50:31.600 --> 03:50:34.363]  I'm just skipping that break right now.
[03:50:34.924 --> 03:50:45.257]  Greg Pound continued to talk about, I mean, when I talk about thousands of missing Florida children the government took, I mean, when I talk about the rape rooms here in Texas, admittedly, I mean, it's the pure evil!
[03:50:45.598 --> 03:50:47.280]  You people, I don't think, can understand.
[03:50:47.340 --> 03:50:48.762]  We're not exaggerating here.
[03:50:50.479 --> 03:51:00.088]  They go to the website NorthCountryGazette.org and look how the prosecuting attorney, Bernie McCabe, has allegations of molesting little children that he was adopting.
[03:51:01.310 --> 03:51:05.234]  How many Homeland Security deputies have been caught doing this?
[03:51:05.774 --> 03:51:11.396]  Well, the federal prosecutor in Pinellas, not in Pinellas, up in the Panhandle, went to have sex with that five-year-old little girl.
[03:51:11.416 --> 03:51:12.656]  I don't know if you heard about that.
[03:51:12.737 --> 03:51:12.997]  Yeah.
[03:51:13.297 --> 03:51:15.598]  But the city council chairman for St.
[03:51:15.658 --> 03:51:18.579]  Petersburg, he was doing the same thing.
[03:51:18.619 --> 03:51:20.799]  He was adopting little children and molesting them.
[03:51:20.959 --> 03:51:25.141]  Al Zimmerman, the spokesman for the whole state of Florida, was molesting little boys.
[03:51:25.601 --> 03:51:26.382]  The F.D.L.E.
[03:51:26.402 --> 03:51:28.863]  in the state of Florida wouldn't arrest him, so they had the F.B.I.
[03:51:28.903 --> 03:51:29.244]  come in.
[03:51:29.264 --> 03:51:30.244]  The F.B.I.
[03:51:30.284 --> 03:51:31.925]  here in the state had to come in and arrest him.
[03:51:31.945 --> 03:51:39.691]  Well, I mean, every week, every day, you hear about some state senator or somebody else who's the head of stopping exploited children, and then they're running the rape ops.
[03:51:40.091 --> 03:51:41.852]  Congressman Foley here in Florida.
[03:51:42.032 --> 03:51:42.813]  Right here in Pinellas.
[03:51:42.853 --> 03:51:43.673]  Congressman Foley.
[03:51:43.913 --> 03:51:47.115]  He was the one who got picked up to that big scandal on the Republican Party.
[03:51:47.135 --> 03:51:48.336]  Do you remember that, Alex?
[03:51:48.556 --> 03:51:48.877]  Oh, yeah.
[03:51:48.917 --> 03:51:49.337]  No, no, no.
[03:51:49.377 --> 03:51:51.939]  But, I mean, you see it all the time.
[03:51:52.019 --> 03:51:53.039]  Yeah, it's just constant.
[03:51:53.440 --> 03:51:55.081]  Well, they've got to get children.
[03:51:56.021 --> 03:51:57.282]  That they've got to get them!
[03:51:57.342 --> 03:52:00.964]  I mean, they are just... I'm just so sick of it!
[03:52:01.064 --> 03:52:04.086]  Alex, have you ever heard why they want to have sex with children?
[03:52:05.227 --> 03:52:05.307]  No.
[03:52:05.327 --> 03:52:06.227]  Do you ever wonder why?
[03:52:07.088 --> 03:52:07.248]  No.
[03:52:07.968 --> 03:52:09.469]  Because they say it feels tighter.
[03:52:11.330 --> 03:52:19.695]  That's why they have sex, men with men and little children, is because Al Zimmerman says, when they finally got to him, they said, he likes having sex with children because it feels tighter.
[03:52:21.124 --> 03:52:21.985]  That's what you're dealing with.
[03:52:22.125 --> 03:52:23.926]  These are the kind of creeps that we got right here.
[03:52:23.946 --> 03:52:28.130]  And they've got a national security state coming in over all of us, folks.
[03:52:29.371 --> 03:52:31.033]  And see, they're just a low-level scum.
[03:52:31.353 --> 03:52:35.316]  The evil up top are the eugenicists running all of this.
[03:52:35.717 --> 03:52:37.538]  I mean, and this is what we're dealing with.
[03:52:37.598 --> 03:52:39.460]  Me and my... I mean, we just don't know what to do.
[03:52:39.520 --> 03:52:40.261]  We just don't know.
[03:52:40.621 --> 03:52:45.465]  I mean, and I'm going to stand, and I'm going to... Now, do you ever even get to see your children anymore?
[03:52:45.485 --> 03:52:46.306]  Have they fully taken them?
[03:52:46.646 --> 03:52:47.347]  No, they're gone.
[03:52:47.947 --> 03:52:55.455]  They're telling me, I'm not giving up my kids, they're going to either kill me, listen it says live free on New Hampshire's license plate, it says live free or die.
[03:52:56.736 --> 03:52:58.518]  Do you know if they've shipped your children out of state?
[03:53:00.120 --> 03:53:02.022]  I don't know.
[03:53:02.042 --> 03:53:10.951]  I mean, I'm constantly trying to find out, the one thing is... And this was all over the dog bite.
[03:53:11.528 --> 03:53:13.210]  All over an accidental dog bite.
[03:53:13.270 --> 03:53:14.211]  It has nothing to do with anything.
[03:53:14.231 --> 03:53:18.756]  Listen, listen, I know well-to-do women and families in Austin, well-to-do.
[03:53:19.137 --> 03:53:22.200]  Their child will break their finger on a jungle gym, CPS tries to take them.
[03:53:22.220 --> 03:53:23.061]  Doesn't matter if they're women.
[03:53:23.101 --> 03:53:23.421]  Oh, yeah.
[03:53:23.441 --> 03:53:24.583]  Every day of the year.
[03:53:24.603 --> 03:53:26.224]  For any reason, they go to the doctors.
[03:53:26.565 --> 03:53:28.387]  The doctors are required.
[03:53:28.407 --> 03:53:28.987]  Explain that to people.
[03:53:29.007 --> 03:53:29.288]  Here we go.
[03:53:37.236 --> 03:53:43.179]  If you break your finger, if your child falls off and breaks their finger in front of witnesses, it doesn't even enrich people that are going after their kids now.
[03:53:45.000 --> 03:53:51.143]  And literally, they have these weirdo judges who they name the buildings after them while they're still in office.
[03:53:52.972 --> 03:53:54.974]  And they're coming straight on for our children.
[03:53:55.014 --> 03:53:59.017]  They are just attacking, attacking, attacking, attacking their own textbooks.
[03:53:59.757 --> 03:54:03.800]  Months ago I said the textbooks say that the families of disease, they want to eradicate it.
[03:54:03.820 --> 03:54:04.901]  The social worker textbooks.
[03:54:05.161 --> 03:54:05.962]  People didn't believe it.
[03:54:06.202 --> 03:54:11.706]  And there was like 20, 30 textbook links and articles that were posted on the PrisonPlanet.com forum.
[03:54:12.726 --> 03:54:13.847]  The doctors are spying.
[03:54:13.887 --> 03:54:15.007]  The nurses are spying.
[03:54:15.307 --> 03:54:16.688]  The whole system is predatory.
[03:54:16.728 --> 03:54:18.809]  They want your children.
[03:54:18.829 --> 03:54:20.610]  They get hundreds of thousands to adopt them.
[03:54:21.730 --> 03:54:24.592]  Local officials want them for their sex rings.
[03:54:25.072 --> 03:54:25.772]  I mean, you're lucky.
[03:54:25.792 --> 03:54:28.153]  You're blessed if they kidnap your child and it just gets adopted.
[03:54:28.554 --> 03:54:29.594]  Most of the time they're okay.
[03:54:29.934 --> 03:54:35.037]  If it goes to one of the officials, and you'll notice most of these officials in your towns, they all got adopted kids.
[03:54:35.097 --> 03:54:35.897]  You can't make this up.
[03:54:37.918 --> 03:54:48.546]  We've got about three or four minutes left here with our guest, Greg Pound, and the website we've got up on the video screen for people watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, FreeOurKids.com.
[03:54:49.346 --> 03:54:55.091]  But listen, when you go to the hospital to have babies, they're there interrogating, and your wife doesn't know.
[03:54:55.111 --> 03:54:57.713]  If you say, oh yeah, we're having trouble with money, they're going to come.
[03:54:57.733 --> 03:55:00.535]  I mean, you've got to realize, the black ops are everywhere.
[03:55:02.296 --> 03:55:03.597]  Anything else you want to add here at the end?
[03:55:03.951 --> 03:55:07.414]  I tried to appeal in court on the issue that we have a right to a trial by jury.
[03:55:07.774 --> 03:55:12.358]  And they said, you can have a right to a trial by jury over a cat if you get a divorce.
[03:55:12.398 --> 03:55:18.363]  A divorced couple, we've got an article where this couple got a right to a trial by jury over a cat because it was worth over $20.
[03:55:18.503 --> 03:55:20.725]  You get a trial by jury for a parking ticket!
[03:55:21.005 --> 03:55:22.646]  But they won't give it to us for our five kids!
[03:55:22.706 --> 03:55:24.028]  I said, isn't that convenient?
[03:55:24.088 --> 03:55:29.352]  In the state of Florida, you don't have a right to a trial by jury for five kids, but you can get one over a cat?
[03:55:29.392 --> 03:55:30.633]  And see, people don't know that.
[03:55:30.693 --> 03:55:32.494]  They don't know these... It's insane!
[03:55:32.634 --> 03:55:33.896]  Have you seen my film, Endgame?
[03:55:34.376 --> 03:55:34.916]  No, I haven't.
[03:55:34.936 --> 03:55:35.837]  I need to send you a copy.
[03:55:36.117 --> 03:55:40.981]  Because we discovered, this is mainline history, it was set up for eugenics courts.
[03:55:41.462 --> 03:55:48.908]  They would sterilize your kids, and because juries wouldn't say that, they claimed it was a health department thing, and just did it.
[03:55:49.508 --> 03:55:51.229]  That's where all this power comes from.
[03:55:52.150 --> 03:55:59.576]  That's why the nurses fill out the forms and the computer stuff when you're having babies at the hospital for the CPS on every family.
[03:56:00.117 --> 03:56:02.599]  Because it goes back to that eugenics, but go ahead.
[03:56:03.119 --> 03:56:05.501]  Well, there's got to be something we can do as an American people.
[03:56:05.641 --> 03:56:07.603]  Our rights don't come from the government, they come from God.
[03:56:07.823 --> 03:56:08.944]  We have a right to our kids.
[03:56:09.484 --> 03:56:12.667]  We have a right to our children, and the children have a right to their parents.
[03:56:13.686 --> 03:56:14.947]  And we want our children back!
[03:56:15.387 --> 03:56:23.454]  And all I can do to ask your listeners to please pray and cry out that God will bring judgment on the state of Florida for the evil they're doing to people and their children.
[03:56:23.474 --> 03:56:25.796]  Now, now, now, they terminated your rights a year into this.
[03:56:25.836 --> 03:56:27.077]  You haven't seen them in three years.
[03:56:28.518 --> 03:56:32.681]  The government child kidnappers, again, name the names of the children they kidnapped.
[03:56:33.382 --> 03:56:37.125]  Hannah, Isaiah, Joanna, Susanna.
[03:56:37.185 --> 03:56:41.769]  My wife's been hiding with... We named our last baby Baby Moses, the one that they're after now.
[03:56:42.671 --> 03:56:47.734]  We've been hiding for two and a half years to keep the state from getting our jobs.
[03:56:47.754 --> 03:56:48.774]  Well, you know, that's a good point.
[03:56:49.134 --> 03:56:57.098]  Governments, the Aztecs, the Babylonians, the others, the Egyptians, would routinely go steal the children of their local slave groups.
[03:56:57.178 --> 03:56:58.679]  So, it's the same policy.
[03:57:00.980 --> 03:57:02.781]  So, I just don't know.
[03:57:03.141 --> 03:57:06.823]  I mean, I wasn't here when the accident happened and neither was my other three kids.
[03:57:07.446 --> 03:57:09.547]  And I mean, we haven't done anything.
[03:57:09.587 --> 03:57:11.087]  We don't smoke, drink, or do drugs.
[03:57:11.467 --> 03:57:12.367]  We love our country.
[03:57:12.807 --> 03:57:15.908]  Well, we know they target Christian families.
[03:57:15.928 --> 03:57:16.548]  They've said that.
[03:57:17.349 --> 03:57:22.070]  People can support you by going to the website, donating there, getting the word out about it.
[03:57:22.190 --> 03:57:26.671]  But by this evil that happened to you, you're a great testament to warn others.
[03:57:27.211 --> 03:57:31.492]  And so I know that this has been a great tribulation for you, but God bless you.
[03:57:31.512 --> 03:57:33.053]  We'll be praying for you and your wife.
[03:57:33.373 --> 03:57:34.373]  Give out your website again.
[03:57:34.853 --> 03:57:35.113]  Okay.
[03:57:35.494 --> 03:57:37.835]  Alex, I want to thank you for your show, brother, and keep it up.
[03:57:38.175 --> 03:57:41.918]  FreeOurKids.com or FreeOurChildren.com.
[03:57:41.938 --> 03:57:43.079]  You can put kids or children.
[03:57:43.119 --> 03:57:43.960]  Either one, it'll come up.
[03:57:44.180 --> 03:57:44.580]  You know what?
[03:57:44.860 --> 03:57:45.781]  20 minutes isn't enough.
[03:57:46.081 --> 03:57:46.822]  Let me set you up.
[03:57:48.325 --> 03:57:51.246]  Let me set you up later this week or next week for a full hour, okay?
[03:57:51.526 --> 03:57:51.686]  Alright.
[03:57:52.207 --> 03:57:52.727]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:57:52.847 --> 03:57:53.147]  You bet.
[03:57:53.167 --> 03:57:53.547]  Take care.
[03:57:53.587 --> 03:57:54.147]  There he goes.
[03:57:54.207 --> 03:57:54.888]  It's not a joke.
[03:57:54.948 --> 03:57:55.608]  It's not a game.
[03:57:55.968 --> 03:57:59.750]  The lawless criminal government is absolutely engaged in every crime imaginable.
[03:58:00.050 --> 03:58:02.891]  Retransmission with a bunch of powerful news and information.
[03:58:03.431 --> 03:58:04.872]  It was a really powerful show today.
[03:58:04.892 --> 03:58:09.014]  Starts at Infowars.com on the audio streams right now and the free podcast.
[03:58:09.034 --> 03:58:10.254]  For everybody else, God bless you all.
