[00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:01.770]  You want answers?
[00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:03.511]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:04.071 --> 00:00:07.453]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:12.396]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.857 --> 00:00:37.400]  I talked some about this yesterday on the broadcast, but I didn't spend as much time on it as I wanted to.
[00:00:38.721 --> 00:00:52.667]  So early in this first hour today, I want to spend some time on this Wednesday edition, the 16th day of April 2008, on a cover story in the local paper here in Austin, Texas, that outlined everything
[00:01:21.186 --> 00:01:21.266]  Yeah.
[00:02:05.882 --> 00:02:06.582]  Hello, my friends.
[00:02:06.642 --> 00:02:07.683]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:02:07.903 --> 00:02:14.125]  As promised, I am going to take your phone calls right now.
[00:02:14.145 --> 00:02:17.907]  And then we are going to get into this little tidbit.
[00:02:18.407 --> 00:02:25.710]  Report Netanyahu says 9-11 terror attacks good for Israel.
[00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.551]  Very, very arrogant.
[00:02:28.311 --> 00:02:30.612]  Very, very in your face.
[00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.850]  Look at that.
[00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.092]  Isn't that a nice little headline for you.
[00:02:37.112 --> 00:02:41.935]  So we'll be breaking that down.
[00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:47.037]  Also, inside sources in Israel saying that there is going to be an attack on Iran.
[00:02:47.537 --> 00:02:48.618]  We will be covering that.
[00:02:48.678 --> 00:02:51.799]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to Joshua in Los Angeles.
[00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:52.419]  You're on the air.
[00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.420]  Thank you for holding.
[00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.680]  Good morning Alex.
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.261]  How are you doing?
[00:02:55.521 --> 00:02:55.741]  Good.
[00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:07.032]  Um, I just got a few things that I wanted to discuss, because I keep seeing, uh, what I think is a problem in the way that we, uh... Well, do me a favor, uh, are you on a cordless, because I can't really hear you.
[00:03:07.492 --> 00:03:08.912]  Oh, yeah, let me switch over.
[00:03:08.932 --> 00:03:10.692]  Sounds like you're fumbling around quite a bit.
[00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:12.433]  Okay, is this better?
[00:03:12.933 --> 00:03:15.053]  Yeah, just try to hold the phone there and go ahead.
[00:03:15.673 --> 00:03:21.214]  Okay, um, well, first of all, the style of language that we use, I think, needs to be modified.
[00:03:21.254 --> 00:03:25.195]  We should be able to preface, uh, what we're saying with, um,
[00:03:26.112 --> 00:03:27.133]  We're good to go.
[00:03:45.501 --> 00:04:01.197]  Well, if you watch in American Drug War, when I confront General McCaffrey, I have the news articles, and I do read them and source them, but you can't always do that, and by Hart saying that he never said New World Order, we did go get the source and then show him as a liar later.
[00:04:01.858 --> 00:04:03.660]  That's the thing, though, that delay there.
[00:04:04.061 --> 00:04:05.462]  I mean, I know you cite sources.
[00:04:05.482 --> 00:04:10.488]  This is more for the listeners than for you, because I know you've got your stuff together, but a lot of us don't because we don't have the experience.
[00:04:10.908 --> 00:04:12.350]  We need to use academic language.
[00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.252]  We need to use academic sourcing.
[00:04:14.873 --> 00:04:19.998]  We need to make sure that we don't make incorrect references, and if we can't remember sources, we need to carry them with us.
[00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:22.121]  If we're not going to carry the sources with us,
[00:04:22.621 --> 00:04:25.803]  Or take the time to do proper research and make proper references.
[00:04:25.883 --> 00:04:27.964]  And that's just lazy and it's completely pointless.
[00:04:28.004 --> 00:04:33.387]  Because you're just, at that point, a person that's doing that is just trying to get it off their chest and isn't really affecting any change.
[00:04:33.907 --> 00:04:35.428]  And if anything... Well, I mean, come on.
[00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:38.769]  I think somebody just screaming at Gary Hart gets something done.
[00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:43.271]  And I think, you know, they went there and said you called for a New World Order and said use a disaster for it.
[00:04:44.392 --> 00:04:45.513]  I think they did a pretty good job.
[00:04:45.573 --> 00:04:46.815]  I mean, none of us are going to be perfect.
[00:04:46.835 --> 00:04:49.337]  If we try to become perfectionists, it'll never get done.
[00:04:49.357 --> 00:04:52.360]  I think it's more important to get out in the field and take action.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:05:03.412]  But, I mean, certainly if they would have dug up the source and said on C-SPAN, September 13, 2001, you said, quote, that would have been a little bit better.
[00:05:03.452 --> 00:05:06.455]  But I don't want to, like, Monday morning quarterback these guys.
[00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:08.610]  Well, you have a legitimate point, Alex.
[00:05:08.671 --> 00:05:14.395]  I just think that if you go to China and you're speaking English to people, they're not going to understand it.
[00:05:14.415 --> 00:05:24.524]  A lot of the people that we're trying to talk to are educated, they're conditioned in a certain manner, and they have a certain culture, and we need to respect that culture in order to speak to them if we want to be effective.
[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:31.905]  We're not going to be able to speak to them in this manner and be taken seriously by other people, because these people that we're talking to aren't going to listen to us.
[00:05:31.925 --> 00:05:33.686]  It's the people that are watching that we want to reach.
[00:05:34.126 --> 00:05:42.292]  And academics and intellectuals are the type of people that are watching these types of things, and if we can speak in a language that they will understand, and that they will respect, then we will succeed.
[00:05:42.312 --> 00:05:44.433]  But I mean, I think they did, and I appreciate your call.
[00:05:45.154 --> 00:05:48.356]  I mean, I think they did.
[00:05:48.376 --> 00:05:51.098]  I don't fully understand what you're saying.
[00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:59.200]  I mean, they did say, you said, and then they, on the video, shoved Gary Hart lying.
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.060]  And that's the audience we're talking to.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.460]  I'm not just targeting intellectuals.
[00:06:03.521 --> 00:06:14.202]  Most of them that are in the institutions are too cowardly of even losing their pension or their tenure to much less even talk about any serious issues.
[00:06:16.523 --> 00:06:23.424]  I want to pull up this article, because it's up on PrisonPlanet.com, to mention it and show it to people.
[00:06:24.383 --> 00:06:26.264]  Because I had it here in my stack and I can't find it.
[00:06:26.845 --> 00:06:32.369]  Paul posted it last night about Israel insiders saying that there's going to be an attack on Iran.
[00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:34.771]  And I'm not saying that means it's going to happen.
[00:06:35.971 --> 00:06:42.056]  But what we do have to look at is that the neocons have boldly attacked quite a few countries that didn't have anything to do with 9-11.
[00:06:45.816 --> 00:06:48.597]  We have to be conscious of the fact that they do do bold things.
[00:06:48.617 --> 00:06:50.537]  I mean, they attacked us on 9-11.
[00:06:51.397 --> 00:06:54.218]  There is no telling what they might do.
[00:06:54.258 --> 00:06:59.039]  There is no telling what they might be capable of doing.
[00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:01.760]  And so we can't underestimate that.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.540]  They do have the aircraft carriers over there.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:12.162]  The neocons are leaving office soon, though they control most of the people that are already in office in both parties.
[00:07:12.702 --> 00:07:14.423]  So it's going to just be passing a torch
[00:07:15.635 --> 00:07:16.796]  Here's a story right here.
[00:07:17.596 --> 00:07:19.777]  This is out of Newsmax.
[00:07:20.297 --> 00:07:22.478]  Jim Meyer's source, U.S.
[00:07:22.519 --> 00:07:24.139]  strike on Iran nearing.
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:33.204]  And then meanwhile, we have comments like this from Benjamin Netanyahu, who says 9-11 terror attacks good for Israel.
[00:07:34.024 --> 00:07:39.207]  That's what I'm going to be talking about after
[00:07:40.871 --> 00:07:42.332]  We take some more of your calls.
[00:07:42.932 --> 00:07:47.315]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Michigan's next.
[00:07:47.876 --> 00:07:49.657]  John in Michigan, you're on the air.
[00:07:49.737 --> 00:07:50.077]  Welcome.
[00:07:51.658 --> 00:07:52.438]  Hiya, Alex.
[00:07:52.899 --> 00:07:54.160]  How's my audio?
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.020]  It's good.
[00:07:56.401 --> 00:07:56.961]  Oh, that's good.
[00:07:56.981 --> 00:08:01.004]  Just turned off my wall air conditioner so you can hear me better.
[00:08:01.084 --> 00:08:01.604]  Well, thank you.
[00:08:04.775 --> 00:08:15.926]  Boy, it's pretty wild with all this technology that the world banking gangsters have with being able to read our minds and, you know, know everything about us.
[00:08:16.587 --> 00:08:20.310]  And I'll be honest with you, personally, I don't have a problem with that.
[00:08:21.211 --> 00:08:26.737]  Because I understand in the spiritual realm, our lives are an open book anyway.
[00:08:30.715 --> 00:08:32.296]  Well, there's a problem with that, sir.
[00:08:32.436 --> 00:08:34.218]  They're not going to read any minds.
[00:08:34.278 --> 00:08:47.729]  They're just going to lie and claim that the computer says that you're guilty and then con the public that you deserve to go to Guantanamo Bay because the computer says so.
[00:08:47.749 --> 00:08:49.190]  And I will cover this as well today.
[00:08:49.491 --> 00:08:51.873]  The government is trying to wrap its mind around yours.
[00:08:54.554 --> 00:09:21.480]  Well, there's some interesting relationships in the book of Revelation with dealing with how all the technologies that the intelligence community has and how they are basically building an evil machine and this evil machine is what people are going to be following and
[00:09:25.004 --> 00:09:40.173]  Uh... becoming subjected to... Yeah, Revelation talks about artificial creations that talk and look like a giant man in Jerusalem and all sorts of wonders that will certainly con the general public.
[00:09:40.193 --> 00:09:40.933]  Thanks for the call.
[00:09:41.273 --> 00:09:42.294]  I appreciate it, John.
[00:09:43.594 --> 00:09:45.736]  Yeah, a lot of people say, well, I have nothing to hide.
[00:09:46.636 --> 00:09:47.896]  Let the government read my mind.
[00:09:48.657 --> 00:09:49.697]  You have privacy.
[00:09:50.477 --> 00:09:53.338]  You see, it's tyrannies that want to spy on you.
[00:09:53.638 --> 00:09:55.399]  It's the bad things that they want to do.
[00:09:56.019 --> 00:10:01.741]  It isn't that, oh, well, let me leave my doors unlocked because I'm a good person, I have nothing to hide.
[00:10:02.241 --> 00:10:04.982]  Yeah, but bad people want to then come in your house and rob you.
[00:10:06.341 --> 00:10:09.524]  Or, you know, your toddler may walk out in the middle of the street and get run over.
[00:10:09.864 --> 00:10:11.526]  It's safe to lock the door.
[00:10:11.906 --> 00:10:14.449]  It isn't that you're living in fear, you're living in control.
[00:10:14.829 --> 00:10:17.872]  Or trying to control your environment as much as you can.
[00:10:17.892 --> 00:10:19.353]  That's what civilization is.
[00:10:20.835 --> 00:10:22.256]  You know, privacy is a good thing.
[00:10:23.017 --> 00:10:24.418]  I mean, let's just go ahead and get graphic.
[00:10:25.139 --> 00:10:28.001]  I don't ask my wife to come into the bathroom when I'm using the bathroom.
[00:10:29.783 --> 00:10:31.264]  Well, what do I have to hide?
[00:10:33.311 --> 00:10:38.574]  And so I do see a lot of copping out, though, with the Bible, saying, well, it's of the Lord.
[00:10:38.614 --> 00:10:39.595]  I mean, it's all coming.
[00:10:39.935 --> 00:10:42.316]  We shouldn't fight against it because the Lord's coming.
[00:10:43.337 --> 00:10:44.498]  They thought that was Hitler.
[00:10:44.538 --> 00:10:46.379]  They thought it hundreds of years ago.
[00:10:46.419 --> 00:10:48.040]  And I mean, the people always think that.
[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:49.601]  I have a job to do.
[00:10:49.701 --> 00:10:50.822]  I'm going to confront corruption.
[00:10:51.882 --> 00:10:53.903]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ken in Austin.
[00:10:53.923 --> 00:10:54.684]  You're on the air, Ken.
[00:10:55.424 --> 00:10:56.405]  Yes, Alex Jones.
[00:10:56.545 --> 00:10:59.567]  I'm glad to have this opportunity to talk with you.
[00:11:00.819 --> 00:11:01.900]  I wanted to thank you.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.862]  You did a great service for me and you telling the information and all.
[00:11:07.722 --> 00:11:14.205]  I wanted to tell you that I was telling a customer one time about my childhood and my experiences.
[00:11:14.265 --> 00:11:18.027]  I've operated all over the world and he wanted me to read a book.
[00:11:18.067 --> 00:11:21.249]  It was by David Icke and it had MKUltra in there.
[00:11:21.769 --> 00:11:23.710]  And it was really, I mean, it was all these things.
[00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:24.530]  I didn't believe it.
[00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:28.432]  Then I was listening to you one day and you were talking about MKUltra.
[00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:31.171]  And I decided to investigate it.
[00:11:31.211 --> 00:11:32.752]  I googled it and studied about it.
[00:11:33.573 --> 00:11:37.996]  And the things that happened to me in my childhood, I'm an MKUltra child.
[00:11:38.816 --> 00:11:43.019]  And I really appreciate that, that you're doing this job for everybody.
[00:11:43.059 --> 00:11:43.699]  Helping everybody.
[00:11:43.719 --> 00:11:45.420]  What, your parents worked for the government?
[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:46.481]  You lived all over the world?
[00:11:46.501 --> 00:11:47.681]  They did what, experiments on you?
[00:11:48.562 --> 00:11:53.525]  No, I... My stepfather was with the police and the masons.
[00:11:53.725 --> 00:11:58.168]  And I was one of the people that had trauma-induced programming.
[00:11:58.849 --> 00:12:07.776]  And I've operated in different parts of the world, and the Central Intelligence Agency agents have come and done things, and I'm one of those people.
[00:12:08.537 --> 00:12:15.642]  Well, they admit, this is even on Discovery Channel and Major TV, and the point is they had it out years after we'd exposed it.
[00:12:16.583 --> 00:12:18.565]  I'm not just going off them as the source, is my point.
[00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:24.089]  And Dr. Ewan Cameron, thousands and thousands, more than 10,000,
[00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:30.893]  Women and children, and some men, but women and children are easier, were taken to facilities in Canada.
[00:12:30.913 --> 00:12:32.534]  They were taken out of foster homes, you name it.
[00:12:33.314 --> 00:12:36.916]  Brainwashed, electroshock, drugs, reprogramming.
[00:12:37.357 --> 00:12:42.860]  I mean, the stuff you see in movies like The Bourne Identity or The Bourne Supremacy.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.541]  Oh, what's the latest one?
[00:12:44.801 --> 00:12:45.721]  The Bourne Ultimatum.
[00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:47.682]  I mean, that's really how they do it.
[00:12:48.683 --> 00:12:50.704]  And how did you discover this?
[00:12:50.744 --> 00:12:51.765]  By then learning about it?
[00:12:52.085 --> 00:12:54.086]  And then did that bring up memories or what happened?
[00:12:54.847 --> 00:12:59.091]  Well, I'm 50 years old, and I've always wanted to figure out what it was done to me.
[00:12:59.912 --> 00:13:05.777]  And when I was doing the Google search, there's a Dr. Ross in Dallas, and he's written books from the medical journals.
[00:13:06.718 --> 00:13:11.402]  And they talked about the tapes, the psychic driving tapes, and I remembered them.
[00:13:11.422 --> 00:13:13.664]  It's trauma-induced programming.
[00:13:16.287 --> 00:13:17.548]  My left frontal lobe was
[00:13:18.311 --> 00:13:19.552]  I guess damaged.
[00:13:19.612 --> 00:13:21.134]  They put a shotgun next to it.
[00:13:21.754 --> 00:13:22.876]  I was then programmed.
[00:13:22.936 --> 00:13:24.417]  It was from the age of 6 to 12.
[00:13:25.658 --> 00:13:28.681]  And when I got to the... They shot you in the head with a shotgun?
[00:13:28.821 --> 00:13:29.342]  No, no.
[00:13:29.362 --> 00:13:30.903]  They put the barrel next to it.
[00:13:31.204 --> 00:13:31.704]  The barrel.
[00:13:32.285 --> 00:13:33.426]  When I was 8 years old.
[00:13:34.247 --> 00:13:35.308]  And that was a trauma.
[00:13:36.248 --> 00:13:42.695]  And, you know, if I wrote the book and told the story, you would get all the details and you would understand.
[00:13:43.576 --> 00:13:47.038]  It's really what I've lived in my life.
[00:13:47.098 --> 00:13:48.359]  I speak many languages.
[00:13:48.439 --> 00:13:50.300]  I spent nearly 10 years at UT.
[00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.961]  I've operated in many countries.
[00:13:52.741 --> 00:14:03.307]  And, you know, when Admiral Stansfield Turner was telling the Congress that he was trying to find the MKUltra children, this guy came up to me during that time in 1978.
[00:14:03.407 --> 00:14:06.689]  And I was in Korea at the time.
[00:14:07.349 --> 00:14:12.932]  And, you know, it's a long story, but I don't want to get into it because it has national security things.
[00:14:13.564 --> 00:14:22.551]  But this is true, and it took two years from the day you said it on the radio for me to admit to myself that I'm one of these MK Ultras.
[00:14:22.952 --> 00:14:33.480]  Well, there's tens of thousands that we know of, but what's interesting about all of this is that David Icke wrote about it, but you didn't even believe it.
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.223]  You didn't know that it was declassified and admitted.
[00:14:36.683 --> 00:14:36.903]  Right.
[00:14:37.143 --> 00:14:38.825]  I thought it was the craziest thing I ever heard.
[00:14:39.395 --> 00:14:46.263]  I found out later a guy called John Marks wrote a book called In Search of the Manchurian Candidate, Mind Control in America.
[00:14:46.323 --> 00:14:49.987]  He did this from 16,000 pages of CIA documents.
[00:14:50.568 --> 00:14:54.953]  And then I found out about the church, Senator Church hearings, and I read everything.
[00:14:55.433 --> 00:14:59.598]  And when I came across Dr. Ross, because he was down in the medical details,
[00:15:00.157 --> 00:15:01.378]  I appreciate what you did.
[00:15:01.398 --> 00:15:03.139]  It's a great service.
[00:15:03.179 --> 00:15:05.680]  When you wake up in the morning, I want you to feel good that you helped somebody.
[00:15:21.684 --> 00:15:22.304]  Well, I try.
[00:15:22.324 --> 00:15:22.905]  I try.
[00:15:22.925 --> 00:15:24.846]  And I appreciate your call, Ken.
[00:15:25.766 --> 00:15:28.147]  I don't doubt that Ken's telling the truth.
[00:15:28.167 --> 00:15:39.153]  See, that's the problem with David Icke, and I'm going to get him back on the show in the near future, is David will talk about MKUltra, he'll talk about the Private Federal Reserve, he'll talk about Bohemian Grove, he'll talk about other Satanism, and all of it's true.
[00:15:39.633 --> 00:15:43.114]  About 95% of what Icke says is absolutely well documented.
[00:15:43.475 --> 00:15:44.515]  He's very well spoken.
[00:15:44.535 --> 00:15:45.916]  I mean, he's a championship goalie.
[00:15:46.376 --> 00:15:48.857]  He was the national presenter for championship games.
[00:15:48.877 --> 00:15:49.898]  I mean, he's like the
[00:15:50.658 --> 00:15:53.319]  Madden of soccer, of football over there.
[00:15:54.059 --> 00:15:55.640]  They call it football, we call it soccer.
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:03.022]  But he's a very well spoken, very charismatic guy and he says all these true things and then he says blood drinking lizards run it.
[00:16:03.622 --> 00:16:06.543]  And then his evidence of that I don't really think is very compelling.
[00:16:09.144 --> 00:16:13.445]  But it kind of discredits a lot of what we do, but I like David, he's a nice guy.
[00:16:15.835 --> 00:16:17.556]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Texas.
[00:16:17.596 --> 00:16:18.357]  Steve, you're on the air.
[00:16:18.937 --> 00:16:20.318]  Yeah, good afternoon, Alex.
[00:16:20.538 --> 00:16:21.078]  Hi.
[00:16:22.019 --> 00:16:38.689]  First of all, I just wanted to say that I am so appreciative of what you and so many others are doing, because I was first made aware of the conspiracy way back in the, I guess, late 80s, early 90s, through the work that the John Birch Society has done.
[00:16:39.551 --> 00:16:45.275]  I believe the guy's name was John McManus, came out with a book called Global Tyranny, step-by-step about the UN.
[00:16:45.616 --> 00:17:01.527]  No, no, their fruits are wonderful, they've educated so many people, and then people try to come out and say that they're government agents, and then their evidence is that one of the board members was Jewish, as if if you're Jewish that means you're automatically evil.
[00:17:02.628 --> 00:17:08.814]  But ignore all the incredible work of the John Birch Society and all the things they've done, all the people they've woken up.
[00:17:09.394 --> 00:17:10.876]  And I mean, they were the first, really.
[00:17:10.896 --> 00:17:13.358]  And then people demonize them.
[00:17:13.778 --> 00:17:19.984]  I mean, I get mad at them because they're not hardcore enough, they're not fast-moving enough, you know, they're backwards a little bit.
[00:17:20.865 --> 00:17:24.588]  But overall, we owe a debt to them, and they're certainly not government agents.
[00:17:24.688 --> 00:17:25.149]  Yes, sir.
[00:17:25.249 --> 00:17:27.371]  And I just wanted to share a couple quick things.
[00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:30.491]  First of all, I don't have a lot of money.
[00:17:30.551 --> 00:17:35.534]  I would love to buy 10,000 of your DVDs and send them to people all over the place.
[00:17:35.914 --> 00:17:37.595]  This is what I want to encourage people about.
[00:17:38.216 --> 00:17:39.516]  Everybody can do their part.
[00:17:39.556 --> 00:17:44.019]  What I've been doing is, I'm doing a simple thing and this is real easy.
[00:17:44.159 --> 00:17:44.959]  Anybody can do this.
[00:17:45.079 --> 00:17:46.020]  I'm telling people,
[00:17:46.676 --> 00:17:49.997]  Go to Google, put in your search, two words, End Game.
[00:17:50.017 --> 00:17:57.319]  When you get the first of the results, End Game by Alex Jones, I tell them it's a two-hour, 19-minute documentary, and I tell them, watch it.
[00:17:57.339 --> 00:17:59.560]  I ask people, have you ever heard of eugenics?
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.321]  Most people have not.
[00:18:02.381 --> 00:18:04.241]  Do you know about the Trans-Texas Quarter?
[00:18:04.261 --> 00:18:05.682]  A lot of people don't know about that.
[00:18:05.762 --> 00:18:06.882]  So I tell them, you need to go.
[00:18:07.728 --> 00:18:08.448]  And it's amazing.
[00:18:08.488 --> 00:18:12.969]  I have had people come back to me saying, wow, I didn't realize this stuff was going on.
[00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:14.389]  Well, that's what I always say.
[00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:25.292]  I mean, I just did three hours of radio and did a one-time plug that we're carrying a video, American Drug War, that exposes the government shipping the drugs in and it's all a fraud.
[00:18:25.772 --> 00:18:28.353]  If everybody saw that, we could end this.
[00:18:28.913 --> 00:18:30.553]  Or even a majority of people saw it.
[00:18:31.293 --> 00:18:34.594]  Same thing with Endgame or Terror Storm, a loose change final cut.
[00:18:35.174 --> 00:18:37.899]  And those are all available on the internet for free.
[00:18:38.419 --> 00:18:43.067]  People that can't afford them need to know that we can't go on making films if somebody doesn't buy some of these from us.
[00:18:43.568 --> 00:18:47.254]  But at the same time, it doesn't even matter because if you don't have money...
[00:18:48.365 --> 00:18:51.846]  Or even if you do have money, spread the word about how they're free on the web.
[00:18:51.886 --> 00:19:03.070]  I mean, there's so much promotion that's gone into some fictional 9-11 book about peak oil, which is fine with me, but I don't know why all that energy, and I interviewed the guy, too, to be nice, but it's like now that's everything.
[00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:07.532]  You just push this one thing instead of all the free videos.
[00:19:07.872 --> 00:19:09.432]  You know, Americans watch now.
[00:19:09.452 --> 00:19:10.673]  They don't read predominantly.
[00:19:11.093 --> 00:19:11.633]  Right.
[00:19:11.693 --> 00:19:24.860]  And the power of saying, hey, here's Terror Storm on Google, or here's Endgame, or if you have $5.95 a month, get a PrisonPlanet.tv member and watch Endgame in super high quality, it's almost DVD quality, and burn it to disk in higher quality.
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:30.483]  I mean, if you have the money, it's pretty cheap to buy 10 DVDs and burn 10 copies of Endgame.
[00:19:30.803 --> 00:19:33.124]  But if you can't afford it, send them to the free web.
[00:19:33.744 --> 00:19:38.506]  All I want to do is not die for nothing, you know, at the end of my life.
[00:19:38.666 --> 00:19:40.467]  I want to fight these criminals.
[00:19:40.507 --> 00:19:42.068]  I mean, I want to expose these people.
[00:19:42.508 --> 00:19:45.470]  You know, and you mentioned, Alex, about, now, I am a Christian.
[00:19:45.490 --> 00:20:00.517]  I've been saved for 29 years, but it galls me that so many people out there that say they're Christians that believe the Bible, you know, you use the word conspiracy, and they look at you, and they give you this deer-in-the-headlights stare response, like, oh, you're crazy, but yet,
[00:20:01.109 --> 00:20:26.464]  That's a Bible term, and the Bible predicts there's going to be a conglomeration of the world's leaders that are going to gather together, and there are talks about reductions in the world's population, drastic reductions, and ultimately they're fighting against God under their master, the devil, and it just got me, and you brought this out so much, the dumbing down of our whole society means people are just too busy
[00:20:26.949 --> 00:20:39.053]  With things that do not matter, and the reason our founding fathers were able to accomplish what they did with the revolution was because they were united, they weren't distracted with all this nonsense that we have today.
[00:20:39.533 --> 00:20:41.393]  I don't care who shot J.R.
[00:20:41.874 --> 00:20:48.996]  and how the last episode of Friends is gonna end, and who won, you know, American Idol and all this junk.
[00:20:49.396 --> 00:20:56.418]  I care about the fact that we have this very precious commodity called liberty that's a God-given commodity,
[00:20:56.917 --> 00:20:57.618]  And you know what?
[00:20:57.698 --> 00:21:07.104]  If we don't do what you've promoted on your show, which is eternal freedom, in order to maintain freedom, we have to have eternal vigilance.
[00:21:07.264 --> 00:21:10.026]  I hear you, and amen to all of that, Steve.
[00:21:10.706 --> 00:21:14.349]  Now let's go ahead and talk to Vince in Nebraska.
[00:21:14.789 --> 00:21:15.769]  Vince, thanks for holding.
[00:21:15.789 --> 00:21:16.410]  You're on the air.
[00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:17.631]  Hi, Alex.
[00:21:18.011 --> 00:21:18.291]  Hello.
[00:21:18.311 --> 00:21:21.093]  I took the bait and decided to call in for the first time.
[00:21:21.833 --> 00:21:22.554]  Good to hear from you.
[00:21:25.038 --> 00:21:27.099]  Take care of some local business here.
[00:21:27.139 --> 00:21:36.163]  I've heard you talk about comprehensive annual financial reports, and I'm going to University of Nebraska here, and they keep jacking up the tuition.
[00:21:36.203 --> 00:21:38.784]  They added an engineering fee on this and everything.
[00:21:38.844 --> 00:21:45.707]  I looked at the report for last year, and it was, boy, there's never a paper trail.
[00:21:45.787 --> 00:21:51.149]  I never saw one before, if that isn't it.
[00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:52.730]  I was wondering,
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:22:00.013]  How could I go about maybe fighting this and maybe, you know, exposing this?
[00:22:02.633 --> 00:22:05.215]  Well, most people don't like paperwork.
[00:22:05.275 --> 00:22:06.116]  Lord knows I don't.
[00:22:07.497 --> 00:22:14.363]  And you can send off your state comprehensive annual financial report, federal ones, different agencies, water districts, school districts, colleges.
[00:22:14.963 --> 00:22:16.104]  You'll always find the same.
[00:22:16.224 --> 00:22:24.431]  Some small 400-person town will have $100 million in slush funds and companies owned and run by the mayor or invested somewhere.
[00:22:25.151 --> 00:22:26.592]  And all they ever talk about is the budget.
[00:22:26.752 --> 00:22:27.413]  Oh, we're broke.
[00:22:27.453 --> 00:22:29.234]  We don't have money on the budget.
[00:22:29.274 --> 00:22:30.515]  That's exactly right.
[00:22:30.535 --> 00:22:37.841]  But the budget, for those that don't know, is what they allot to spend and talk about in the media, while they have the whole second set of books.
[00:22:37.921 --> 00:22:38.761]  It's the whole world.
[00:22:39.682 --> 00:22:45.847]  And if people don't find out what the Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports are, and now they're hidden in plain view, they'll just keep being slaves.
[00:22:45.887 --> 00:22:47.588]  But they won't fill the potholes.
[00:22:47.628 --> 00:22:49.349]  They won't fix the squad car radios.
[00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:53.513]  They'll let schools shut down as stunts.
[00:22:54.453 --> 00:23:02.879]  Well, I heard they're cooking the books for, you know, computers missing and, you know, nobody cares and just life goes on.
[00:23:03.599 --> 00:23:05.721]  And I just thought maybe it'd be nice to do something.
[00:23:07.195 --> 00:23:17.180]  I mean, look, the University of Texas, last time I looked, had fifty, just a few years ago it was twenty-four, fifty-something billion off-budget, just in cream cash.
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.701]  And then they've got hundreds of billions in assets.
[00:23:20.721 --> 00:23:23.863]  The university and the students is a very small part of what they do now.
[00:23:24.463 --> 00:23:27.764]  And then it's only Bebo and the football game and kind of a facade.
[00:23:29.145 --> 00:23:35.551]  Doubling tuition, and increasing parking, and people in state gotta pay out the nose, and it's all paid for.
[00:23:35.611 --> 00:23:38.654]  It's all taxpayer funded, but it's a private organization.
[00:23:39.315 --> 00:23:41.517]  And then they went and financed buying the Rangers.
[00:23:41.557 --> 00:23:43.959]  They went and, you know, this is just the University of Texas at Austin.
[00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:48.664]  They financed buying and making Clear Channel, then handing it over to Mitt Romney's company.
[00:23:48.684 --> 00:23:49.645]  That deal's fallen through.
[00:23:50.305 --> 00:23:53.287]  And it's just all, that's why UT is so important.
[00:23:53.628 --> 00:23:57.871]  All these guys that work at the university, it's the biggest university in the world, and it's a private business.
[00:23:58.271 --> 00:24:02.595]  The students, and people wonder why you don't see professors there anymore, or there's not even really teaching.
[00:24:03.175 --> 00:24:10.841]  It's all either research into controlling or psych warfare, or weapons development, or marketing, or it's tuition.
[00:24:11.162 --> 00:24:12.823]  You send your kids to learn nothing.
[00:24:13.942 --> 00:24:14.422]  Basically.
[00:24:14.923 --> 00:24:19.685]  Unless it's a medical school or engineering side, and then it's some foreigner teaching you.
[00:24:19.805 --> 00:24:20.566]  It's a total scam.
[00:24:20.606 --> 00:24:21.306]  I appreciate your call.
[00:24:22.187 --> 00:24:23.688]  Yeah, go ahead.
[00:24:25.589 --> 00:24:25.989]  Anything else?
[00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:26.609]  Okay, he's gone.
[00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:28.290]  I'm going to try to move really quick here.
[00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:32.393]  These are all wonderful calls, but I want to move as quickly as possible through all of these.
[00:24:33.021 --> 00:24:34.623]  Yeah, it's a facade.
[00:24:35.083 --> 00:24:36.424]  The universities aren't real.
[00:24:36.765 --> 00:24:37.445]  None of it's real.
[00:24:38.086 --> 00:24:46.895]  Just like there's from 300,000 cops to 2 million cops in 15 years, but 15 years ago when there were 300,000 cops, if your house got robbed, they came.
[00:24:46.915 --> 00:24:48.576]  If your car got stolen, they came.
[00:24:48.596 --> 00:24:49.657]  That was when they were still cops.
[00:24:50.118 --> 00:24:51.099]  Now they're there to write tickets.
[00:24:52.619 --> 00:24:53.680]  Here's a case point example.
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.882]  Cops didn't used to give you a ticket going six, seven miles over.
[00:24:56.342 --> 00:24:58.464]  You go five miles over the speed limit, they give you a ticket now.
[00:24:58.864 --> 00:25:03.428]  It's all about you the schmuck, me the schmuck, being sucked off of.
[00:25:04.149 --> 00:25:05.110]  This is piracy.
[00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:05.970]  This is abuse.
[00:25:06.571 --> 00:25:07.452]  That's all it is.
[00:25:08.831 --> 00:25:10.152]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[00:25:10.812 --> 00:25:12.513]  Let's talk to Ernest in New York.
[00:25:12.553 --> 00:25:13.373]  You're on the air, Ernest.
[00:25:13.853 --> 00:25:14.894]  Hey Alex, what's going on?
[00:25:14.914 --> 00:25:17.235]  I'm sorry I can't really talk that much.
[00:25:17.275 --> 00:25:18.955]  I'm working at Morgan Stanley right now.
[00:25:19.055 --> 00:25:19.556]  That's okay.
[00:25:19.616 --> 00:25:21.256]  But I just wanted to give you a quick tip.
[00:25:21.937 --> 00:25:24.978]  I sent over last night some information on your InfoWars.
[00:25:24.998 --> 00:25:28.840]  I don't know if you know about Tavis Smiley on PBS?
[00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:32.041]  Now what email address did you send it?
[00:25:32.061 --> 00:25:32.681]  I'll try to find it.
[00:25:33.322 --> 00:25:35.923]  It should be on device.cdent.hotmail.com.
[00:25:36.687 --> 00:25:38.908]  But I mean, whose email boxes did you send it to?
[00:25:38.968 --> 00:25:43.351]  I sent it to the contact page on InfoWars.
[00:25:43.731 --> 00:25:45.752]  I think it just goes into it.
[00:25:46.334 --> 00:25:47.995]  Okay, well tell me what this individual said.
[00:26:16.894 --> 00:26:20.236]  He's been basically, you know, asking very tough questions.
[00:26:20.877 --> 00:26:21.937]  But then what do you do?
[00:26:22.337 --> 00:26:25.159]  Because Hillary has got all the same people behind her.
[00:26:25.519 --> 00:26:26.259]  Exactly.
[00:26:26.279 --> 00:26:31.542]  But the thing is that he was pretty much posing out all these questions about what's going on.
[00:26:31.602 --> 00:26:39.567]  And the way he's been talking on the show, it seemed that he knew, he's found out exactly what is going on.
[00:26:40.067 --> 00:26:41.828]  But, you know, he's been editing himself.
[00:26:42.288 --> 00:26:48.776]  Just trying to just be straight line and not come out and say, you know, like Alex Jones, New World or New World, but he's just pointing out some questions.
[00:26:48.796 --> 00:26:58.648]  But because he's done that and because of all the mind programming and all the propagandas out there, he's been demonized so much that he actually, the last two weeks, he quit his show.
[00:27:00.016 --> 00:27:09.325]  He literally said that, I mean, it was just, he's just been so demonized that he just said screw it, he quit, and he didn't want to, he was just so disgusted with the whole situation.
[00:27:09.706 --> 00:27:11.808]  Well that's too bad, he should have stayed in the fight.
[00:27:11.908 --> 00:27:22.678]  Yeah, but no, but I just thought that he might be, you know, a good person to have on the show and just, you know, maybe to get his idea because he's someone who has a pulse on the African American community.
[00:27:22.958 --> 00:27:27.660]  No, in fact, I wrote down Travis Smiley's name and I know who he is and I will attempt to get him on.
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:34.444]  I put everything on the contact as an article, a newspaper article.
[00:27:34.464 --> 00:27:43.428]  You should be able to read about that and get the full perspective, but I don't want to take up too much of your time because they're calling me back to the plantation right now.
[00:27:43.468 --> 00:27:46.009]  I'll talk to you whenever I get a chance to.
[00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:46.930]  Good to hear from you.
[00:27:47.867 --> 00:27:49.948]  Yeah, I should have talked about this more on the show.
[00:27:49.968 --> 00:27:51.628]  I should say this every hour on the hour.
[00:27:51.708 --> 00:27:52.988]  We all have a choice to make.
[00:27:54.029 --> 00:27:56.949]  Are we on the side of good, or are we on the side of evil?
[00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:03.671]  You know, George Bush said, you're either with us or against us, and then meanwhile he's blocked people going after Bin Laden, and that's admitted.
[00:28:04.131 --> 00:28:06.912]  And Bin Laden isn't even in the FBI's most wanted list.
[00:28:07.492 --> 00:28:13.074]  Somebody posted a local newscast where they called the FBI, and the FBI said, yeah, we're not saying he did 9-11.
[00:28:13.874 --> 00:28:16.995]  I mean, he's not on the most wanted list for 9-11, did you know that?
[00:28:18.558 --> 00:28:19.979]  I mean, this is an evil government.
[00:28:19.999 --> 00:28:27.443]  These are manifestly evil people that are in control of our government, and you're either against them or you're for them.
[00:28:28.624 --> 00:28:31.246]  And they're planning more and more evil.
[00:28:31.306 --> 00:28:34.207]  If they're not stopped, God knows what they'll do.
[00:28:35.368 --> 00:28:39.411]  And I know most of you tuned in here, I hate to even preach at you because you are involved, you do care.
[00:28:40.422 --> 00:28:44.165]  And you're having more and more people on the left, more and more people on the right realize it's a false paradigm.
[00:28:44.605 --> 00:28:48.607]  And they are speaking out, and they are coming out and saying it's an inside job, and that we're in a lot of trouble.
[00:28:50.068 --> 00:28:51.029]  And that's what it's going to take.
[00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:56.112]  Just saying, you know what, I don't care how dangerous this is, or what my neighbors think.
[00:28:56.753 --> 00:28:58.874]  It's more dangerous to not speak out.
[00:28:58.894 --> 00:29:00.795]  It's more dangerous to not be involved.
[00:29:01.536 --> 00:29:02.877]  And that's the choice you have out there.
[00:29:04.434 --> 00:29:16.918]  I mean, are you going to let Karl Rove and others say they control reality and you don't matter and you're just basically a mannequin that is part of the set and they're the director?
[00:29:19.339 --> 00:29:20.120]  It's really that simple.
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:27.122]  Let's go ahead and talk to Eric in California.
[00:29:27.162 --> 00:29:27.682]  Go ahead, Eric.
[00:29:28.943 --> 00:29:29.963]  Hey, how are you doing today, Alex?
[00:29:30.003 --> 00:29:30.263]  Good.
[00:29:31.263 --> 00:29:32.584]  I really appreciate your fourth hour.
[00:29:33.319 --> 00:29:37.280]  I just can't get enough of your in-depth analysis of just everything that's going on.
[00:29:38.521 --> 00:30:02.929]  I want to share my frustration, and I'm sure it's the frustration of many others out there, when Darrell Issa's story broke about him denying funding for dying first responders, my gut reaction was, you know, I've got to do everything I possibly can to make sure that he doesn't get re-elected, because he's my supposed representative in my district.
[00:30:05.351 --> 00:30:10.713]  Unfortunately, that is a huge machine and I kind of had to come to my senses on that.
[00:30:11.913 --> 00:30:22.256]  However, at the LA Symposium, and this is also something that's been very frustrating, at the LA Symposium you told me to get a public access channel.
[00:30:22.316 --> 00:30:31.799]  And I looked into it, I talked to somebody who has a channel, a public access channel show, and I looked into it and I just realized I don't have the time for that as well.
[00:30:32.657 --> 00:30:35.078]  You've got to make the time, man.
[00:30:35.699 --> 00:30:35.999]  I know.
[00:30:36.039 --> 00:30:41.701]  Well, you know, I'm struggling to keep my family fed and be a father and a husband.
[00:30:41.841 --> 00:30:43.082]  Oh, no, I'm not knocking you.
[00:30:43.142 --> 00:30:44.043]  I'm not saying you're bad.
[00:30:45.183 --> 00:30:45.683]  No, I know.
[00:30:45.803 --> 00:30:46.784]  How old are your children?
[00:30:46.824 --> 00:30:48.144]  Take them down to the TV station with you.
[00:30:49.125 --> 00:30:56.829]  I've got a 14-year-old son, and he actually talks to his friends at middle school about the Federal Reserve.
[00:30:56.849 --> 00:30:56.929]  Good.
[00:30:56.969 --> 00:30:57.149]  Yeah.
[00:31:00.242 --> 00:31:29.831]  So, uh, what I've kind of realized is that the most effective thing that I can do that doesn't require too much time is to blanket my immediate neighborhood, you know, just like a radius, figure out, you know, five mile radius or one mile radius or whatever, and just hand out two of the most effective DVDs that you and others have put out, and then just hang them on people's mailboxes and invite them to check it out, you know, write up a short one-page thing of why they need to watch it and
[00:31:34.132 --> 00:31:36.954]  I think that is something that just about everybody can do.
[00:31:45.635 --> 00:31:47.856]  And I'll just continue my operation on that.
[00:31:48.296 --> 00:31:49.297]  It's very effective.
[00:31:49.337 --> 00:31:49.817]  Know this.
[00:31:49.837 --> 00:31:59.481]  If it wasn't for all of you out there making copies of documentaries and calling into talk shows and talking to their neighbors and handing out flyers, they would have already staged more terror attacks.
[00:31:59.521 --> 00:32:02.882]  We'd be in Iran right now and their New World Order would be moving forward.
[00:32:03.183 --> 00:32:06.024]  But instead, you've taken action and you're really kicking butt.
[00:32:06.064 --> 00:32:06.964]  I appreciate your call.
[00:32:07.444 --> 00:32:08.705]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[00:32:08.725 --> 00:32:10.626]  I've got to move quicker because I've got some news I want to cover.
[00:32:11.226 --> 00:32:13.786]  And the phone calls are just pouring in faster than I can take them.
[00:32:14.287 --> 00:32:15.727]  I'm going to really start moving quick.
[00:32:15.767 --> 00:32:16.827]  Each caller gets one minute.
[00:32:16.867 --> 00:32:17.707]  Toby in Indiana.
[00:32:17.927 --> 00:32:18.207]  Welcome.
[00:32:19.107 --> 00:32:20.208]  Hello, thanks for taking my call.
[00:32:20.448 --> 00:32:20.968]  Thanks for calling.
[00:32:21.408 --> 00:32:33.310]  I just wanted to briefly talk about your JFK film that you're coming up with and ask if you're covering basically the street drain that's on Elm Street.
[00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:35.510]  I saw a documentary years ago.
[00:32:35.971 --> 00:32:38.071]  It's the only one I've ever seen that ever mentioned it.
[00:32:38.809 --> 00:32:45.813]  Well, basically this guy brought in an ex-special forces guy and said, hey, if you had to snipe someone from here, where would you go?
[00:32:45.954 --> 00:32:55.219]  And he found this street drain that was big enough to squat down in and it was a perfect shot as the limo would come down the hill towards the bridge.
[00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:58.481]  Well, there had been workmen in the drain and a lot of weird stuff going on there.
[00:32:58.501 --> 00:33:00.203]  They had shooters all over the place.
[00:33:01.563 --> 00:33:03.805]  And yes, Mars does talk a little bit about the drain.
[00:33:03.825 --> 00:33:05.226]  I don't know if it's going to be in the film.
[00:33:05.746 --> 00:33:05.986]  Okay.
[00:33:06.166 --> 00:33:06.727]  Alright, well, thank you.
[00:33:07.554 --> 00:33:09.215]  No, thank you, that's a really great question.
[00:33:10.156 --> 00:33:12.197]  Now let's go ahead and go to Will in Pennsylvania.
[00:33:12.237 --> 00:33:13.017]  Will, you're on the air.
[00:33:13.037 --> 00:33:14.778]  Mr. Stinky Feet.
[00:33:15.599 --> 00:33:16.399]  Hey, man, how you doing?
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:17.780]  How you doing, man?
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:27.046]  I'm really proud of you, man, because your behavior in the past could be construed by some as sort of hesitant on the Israel connection.
[00:33:27.066 --> 00:33:34.070]  I used to be a hardcore Zionist run and all, but I'm starting to see the Anglo-American establishment's power and influence.
[00:33:38.509 --> 00:33:48.717]  I'm calling just if anybody out there in Canada has any video footage of Donald Rumsfeld talking about the aerosolized Prozac and Valium.
[00:33:49.157 --> 00:33:58.045]  If you have any information, could you please contact me at MySpace slash P-A-Y-Z-E.
[00:33:58.085 --> 00:33:58.925]  That's PAYZ.
[00:33:59.066 --> 00:33:59.986]  P-A-Y-Z-E.
[00:34:00.166 --> 00:34:01.968]  There's also lots of good truth music there.
[00:34:02.623 --> 00:34:07.565]  I get told every day it's the most powerful truth music people have ever heard, hip-hop.
[00:34:08.805 --> 00:34:10.966]  But I need to know about this aerosolized Prozac.
[00:34:11.686 --> 00:34:12.527]  Let me stop you.
[00:34:13.407 --> 00:34:16.128]  Is there some report about an aerosolized Prozac?
[00:34:16.848 --> 00:34:20.690]  Alan Watts said he's seen it on CBC.
[00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:28.793]  A while back they asked Donald Rumsfeld what's the plans of any attacks or mass panic.
[00:34:28.833 --> 00:34:29.513]  He said we have
[00:34:30.532 --> 00:34:34.318]  Allegedly, we have aerosolized Prozac and Valium ready to go.
[00:34:39.562 --> 00:34:45.085]  The Sunshine Project did discover they have knockout opiates to knock out whole cities.
[00:34:45.705 --> 00:34:47.966]  And that's documented.
[00:34:47.986 --> 00:34:51.388]  Sunshine Project right out of Texas got that about six years ago now.
[00:34:52.269 --> 00:34:59.993]  And I know that there have been Pentagon programs and plans testing spraying knockout gases, pleasure type chemicals.
[00:35:00.593 --> 00:35:02.754]  Different things have been tested, even back to Vietnam.
[00:35:03.194 --> 00:35:06.476]  But Alan's usually pretty accurate, so I'll have to get him back on and ask him about that.
[00:35:06.656 --> 00:35:08.157]  A.J., they scrubbed it.
[00:35:08.577 --> 00:35:11.079]  I did a search and you can tell they scrubbed it.
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.261]  Whatever was there was just scrubbed completely.
[00:35:14.281 --> 00:35:19.364]  If somebody has information, please, myspace.com.
[00:35:20.785 --> 00:35:25.548]  Also free truth music to download.
[00:35:25.649 --> 00:35:30.812]  Massad's motto isn't that we shall do war by deception?
[00:35:31.292 --> 00:35:35.455]  And the Army School of Advanced Military Studies
[00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:47.161]  Even said they're cunning, ruthless, wild card, able to attack our American forces and blame it on Palestinian people.
[00:35:47.202 --> 00:35:50.024]  Yeah, that was in the Washington Post a few days before 9-11.
[00:35:50.625 --> 00:35:51.226]  Yes, yes.
[00:35:52.587 --> 00:35:57.492]  Just like on September 10th, we have Rumsfeld coming out talking about $2.3 trillion, then what, another $1.2 trillion?
[00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:11.492]  Yeah, my whole thing on Israel is that it's all part of the same thing.
[00:36:11.512 --> 00:36:12.752]  I mean, it's indistinguishable.
[00:36:13.792 --> 00:36:18.013]  And so, when you go with the buzzword of that, it just allows the establishment to attack you.
[00:36:18.733 --> 00:36:23.614]  Anglo-American establishment, the mainline Israelis, you know, it's just indistinguishable.
[00:36:24.494 --> 00:36:27.075]  The intelligence agencies all nexus in together.
[00:36:29.159 --> 00:36:30.840]  I don't like all the different camps.
[00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:34.220]  They've got biblical camps that fight with each other.
[00:36:34.901 --> 00:36:37.661]  They've got the camps that think that Catholics run everything.
[00:36:37.701 --> 00:36:39.762]  They've got camps that think it's all about Jews.
[00:36:40.782 --> 00:36:42.143]  And they all fight with each other.
[00:36:42.243 --> 00:36:45.023]  And then, I mean, can't we just all agree and fight the New World Order?
[00:36:45.504 --> 00:36:54.086]  And can't we all agree on liberty and freedom, the Bill of Rights, Constitution, controlling our sovereignty, our borders, lower taxes?
[00:36:54.106 --> 00:36:57.167]  I mean, can't we just agree on
[00:36:59.454 --> 00:37:00.255]  Things that work?
[00:37:01.476 --> 00:37:04.799]  Can't we agree on things we can get done?
[00:37:04.879 --> 00:37:06.000]  Things that we can agree on?
[00:37:07.381 --> 00:37:09.803]  Can't we agree to focus on things that we agree on?
[00:37:11.085 --> 00:37:12.005]  I mean, it's really simple.
[00:37:13.427 --> 00:37:16.790]  I mean, I have a radio show that people can tune into, not that I'm perfect,
[00:37:18.852 --> 00:37:20.273]  And we're talking about different issues.
[00:37:20.333 --> 00:37:22.254]  I mean, we're going to cover news.
[00:37:22.294 --> 00:37:24.094]  We cover a lot of ground.
[00:37:24.415 --> 00:37:25.695]  The calls bring up a lot of issues.
[00:37:25.735 --> 00:37:30.337]  And you tune into other shows, man, and it's all Catholics are evil all the time.
[00:37:30.878 --> 00:37:33.099]  Or it's all Jews are evil all the time.
[00:37:34.119 --> 00:37:36.800]  And those people said, oh, it's not Jews, it's Zionists.
[00:37:37.561 --> 00:37:40.982]  And then now they say, don't you just say it's just Zionists, it's Jews.
[00:37:42.083 --> 00:37:44.504]  You know, and I'm just like, man, I'm, you know.
[00:37:46.064 --> 00:37:47.506]  I'm not here to hurt people's feelings.
[00:37:47.546 --> 00:37:49.848]  I'm not here to make this a big racial discussion.
[00:37:50.869 --> 00:37:51.970]  But I'm doing a lot of good work.
[00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:52.851]  I'm waking people up.
[00:37:52.911 --> 00:37:54.032]  I'm talking about real issues.
[00:37:55.353 --> 00:37:59.537]  And I'm not normally tired.
[00:38:00.558 --> 00:38:04.743]  But today, for some reason, the engineer in the run thing has been watching me.
[00:38:04.863 --> 00:38:07.886]  I keep hitting the document button going, oh, yes, scholar.
[00:38:09.141 --> 00:38:10.342]  It's kind of cozy in here.
[00:38:10.402 --> 00:38:11.222]  It's kind of warm.
[00:38:11.242 --> 00:38:13.743]  I might as well just take a nap for a minute.
[00:38:16.524 --> 00:38:17.385]  New kind of radio.
[00:38:20.206 --> 00:38:21.846]  Man, I don't know why I'm so tired.
[00:38:23.347 --> 00:38:25.008]  It hit me right when this fourth hour started.
[00:38:26.488 --> 00:38:29.089]  I am just absolutely hammered tired.
[00:38:33.635 --> 00:38:34.516]  That'll be on YouTube.
[00:38:34.556 --> 00:38:35.317]  I'm just joking around.
[00:38:35.717 --> 00:38:36.878]  I am super relaxed now.
[00:38:36.938 --> 00:38:38.379]  I mean, I could go to sleep right now.
[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:40.281]  I don't ever really take naps.
[00:38:41.082 --> 00:38:42.563]  Here's some news I want to cover.
[00:38:42.623 --> 00:38:45.125]  I've got government is trying to wrap its mind around yours.
[00:38:45.766 --> 00:38:50.350]  Kurt Nimmo is leaving to go on a plane in a little while, so I've got to end the show on time today so I can say bye to him.
[00:38:51.371 --> 00:38:52.932]  Burmese is down here doing a project with us.
[00:38:53.733 --> 00:38:54.654]  Everything must go.
[00:38:54.674 --> 00:38:55.875]  I've already covered that.
[00:38:55.935 --> 00:38:59.278]  Report Netanyahu says 9-11 terror attack is good for Israel.
[00:39:01.124 --> 00:39:04.166]  And then I got Bush saying Pakistan-based militants may attack U.S.
[00:39:04.606 --> 00:39:06.288]  That ties into the Israel comment.
[00:39:07.248 --> 00:39:09.190]  But let me go ahead and cover some news now.
[00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:11.491]  Oh, I got Hal in India.
[00:39:12.432 --> 00:39:12.872]  Indiana.
[00:39:14.033 --> 00:39:14.753]  Steve in Utah.
[00:39:14.793 --> 00:39:16.154]  Tell them I'm tired.
[00:39:16.254 --> 00:39:16.635]  India.
[00:39:17.535 --> 00:39:18.356]  David in Texas.
[00:39:18.376 --> 00:39:19.196]  Chris, Louisiana.
[00:39:19.216 --> 00:39:19.937]  John, Michigan.
[00:39:20.357 --> 00:39:21.238]  Keith, Kentucky.
[00:39:21.678 --> 00:39:22.639]  And a couple others.
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:26.962]  We'll see what we can do, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:29.770]  The filibuster.
[00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:31.191]  I've got to wake up.
[00:39:31.291 --> 00:39:32.471]  It's not like I'm even sleepy.
[00:39:32.511 --> 00:39:33.692]  I'm like super relaxed.
[00:39:35.032 --> 00:39:37.653]  Somebody put something in my Chinese food you guys brought me today?
[00:39:37.673 --> 00:39:40.154]  A little something.
[00:39:40.174 --> 00:39:46.116]  I really feel like I'm tired and had four glasses of wine or something.
[00:39:47.497 --> 00:39:52.879]  I think it was tiring not taking one call for three hours in the first three hours of the show ranting.
[00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:02.264]  The government is trying to wrap its mind around yours.
[00:40:02.344 --> 00:40:03.805]  Let me just get to the Israel stuff first.
[00:40:07.109 --> 00:40:09.531]  Now remember, Israel and the U.S.
[00:40:09.551 --> 00:40:15.377]  government, the British, would have you believe that the only threat to society is... dun-dun-dun-dun...
[00:40:18.047 --> 00:40:19.087]  is Al-Qaeda.
[00:40:20.027 --> 00:40:34.470]  And it's admitted it was created by our government, it's admitted that it doesn't even exist outside of a kind of intelligence envelope that Western agencies use to overthrow Arab nations or Central Asian nations, if they're secular and start competing with the globalists.
[00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:42.872]  But every time we try to get our freedoms back, they say, no, and this appears to attack
[00:40:44.353 --> 00:40:46.074]  Al-Qaeda!
[00:40:46.634 --> 00:40:48.475]  Al-Qaeda will get you!
[00:40:48.495 --> 00:40:50.897]  Alright, I'm going to stop acting stupid.
[00:40:52.879 --> 00:40:54.560]  Hey, a little humor, that woke me up.
[00:40:57.062 --> 00:40:57.322]  Okay.
[00:40:58.903 --> 00:41:01.345]  Report, Netanyahu says 9-11 terror attacks good for Israel.
[00:41:10.836 --> 00:41:14.117]  Report, Netanyahu says 9-11 terror attacks good for Israel.
[00:41:15.018 --> 00:41:16.318]  This is Haratz.
[00:41:16.599 --> 00:41:22.541]  Now every time we post one of these articles or a link to it, people comment on the InfoWars site, don't bash Israel, how dare you!
[00:41:23.942 --> 00:41:31.305]  When a major Israeli paper last week said 1,000 dead Arabs isn't worth one dead Jewish boy,
[00:41:33.652 --> 00:41:42.574]  I mean, that is really Nazi-like, or tribal, whatever you want to call it, and it's despicable, and it goes against everything that Israel claims they're against.
[00:41:43.914 --> 00:41:51.656]  And people, we posted part of the story and put a link to the rest of it as customary on the web, and people were posting, how dare you bash Israel?
[00:41:52.216 --> 00:41:59.797]  So, I mean, there's that other extreme side of just worshipping, which then only gives a blank check to Israel to behave in these ways.
[00:41:59.817 --> 00:42:03.118]  In our report, Netanyahu says 9-11 terror attacks are good for Israel.
[00:42:03.769 --> 00:42:12.354]  Well, remember the neocon writer in the Philadelphia Daily News saying 9-11 was wonderful, we need more 9-11 attacks, oh yes, they're good, and all the Republican memos?
[00:42:12.414 --> 00:42:13.394]  I mean, see the motive here?
[00:42:14.595 --> 00:42:30.483]  The Israeli newspaper Ma'ariv on Wednesday reported that Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu told an audience at Bar-Ian University that the September 11, 2001 terror attacks had been beneficial for Israel.
[00:42:30.664 --> 00:42:31.244]  No kidding.
[00:42:33.151 --> 00:42:37.474]  But see, you had that nexus of competing interests that were together on this.
[00:42:37.955 --> 00:42:49.244]  The Israel Zionist, the weapons contractors, the oil dealers, those that want domestic police states, all those interests coming together, making a fist.
[00:42:50.305 --> 00:42:54.868]  If I punch you with my fist, does that mean that this finger is guilty and this finger is innocent?
[00:42:54.928 --> 00:42:57.110]  No, it means it's all part of the same system.
[00:42:57.350 --> 00:43:01.694]  Because saying all these groups work together doesn't absolve any one other group.
[00:43:04.363 --> 00:43:06.864]  You know, the major Protestant groups are for the New World Order now.
[00:43:06.904 --> 00:43:08.645]  The major Catholic groups are for the New World Order.
[00:43:09.665 --> 00:43:11.866]  The major Israeli groups are for a New World Order.
[00:43:11.926 --> 00:43:15.248]  The major conservative, liberal groups, it's all by the same people.
[00:43:16.068 --> 00:43:17.889]  And that forms a fist.
[00:43:17.909 --> 00:43:21.630]  And once you have a debate about one finger, it's really about a whole hand.
[00:43:21.871 --> 00:43:26.092]  And if you attack the whole hand, no one feels left out or singled out.
[00:43:26.112 --> 00:43:29.614]  And everybody can go, oh yes, the man, the system is corrupt.
[00:43:30.114 --> 00:43:30.894]  It's out of control.
[00:43:30.934 --> 00:43:31.735]  They understand, see?
[00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:36.163]  By telling the truth, by giving people wide-spectrum information.
[00:43:37.143 --> 00:43:40.586]  Then you're not pigeon-holed and balkanized as the globalists want.
[00:43:43.288 --> 00:43:45.869]  They want you focused on the Bin Laden bogeyman.
[00:43:47.771 --> 00:43:48.791]  You want to see it again, folks?
[00:43:49.012 --> 00:43:49.652]  Very vicious.
[00:43:51.073 --> 00:43:51.654]  So stupid.
[00:43:52.674 --> 00:43:54.395]  I did draw that in five seconds the other day.
[00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:04.303]  We are benefiting from one thing, and that is the attack on the Twin Towers and Pentagon, and the American struggle in Iraq.
[00:44:05.704 --> 00:44:08.125]  Notice that he's saying that.
[00:44:10.787 --> 00:44:14.249]  Why would Al Qaeda attack, knowing it would bring down the wrath and would benefit Israel?
[00:44:14.269 --> 00:44:16.050]  See, that's a one-on-one equation.
[00:44:16.310 --> 00:44:20.012]  I mean, people that know how to run hijackings from caves, they know that would have helped Israel.
[00:44:20.472 --> 00:44:21.473]  But see, they didn't do it.
[00:44:22.333 --> 00:44:26.756]  We are benefiting from one thing, and that is the attack on the Twin Towers and Pentagon, and the American struggle in Iraq.
[00:44:28.066 --> 00:44:33.790]  Quoted the former Prime Minister as saying, he reportedly added, that the events swung American public opinion in our favor.
[00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:43.057]  Netanyahu reportedly made the comments during a conference at Bar-Illin University, a division of Jerusalem, as part of the peace deal with the Palestinians.
[00:44:43.097 --> 00:44:54.065]  Meanwhile, Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad cast doubt over the veracity of September 11th attacks Thursday, calling it a pretext to invade Afghanistan and Iraq.
[00:44:54.625 --> 00:44:55.766]  This is Haratz, folks.
[00:44:56.226 --> 00:44:57.407]  They're agreeing with us, I guess.
[00:44:57.447 --> 00:44:58.047]  It's really weird.
[00:44:58.648 --> 00:45:01.750]  Haratz reports that Israel stages fake terror attacks against itself.
[00:45:02.291 --> 00:45:05.673]  Haratz is a pretty interesting newspaper, I've got to tell you.
[00:45:06.554 --> 00:45:08.255]  This is being reported by two Israeli papers.
[00:45:09.534 --> 00:45:12.016]  Four or five years ago, a suspicious event occurred in New York.
[00:45:12.116 --> 00:45:20.621]  A building collapsed and they said 3,000 people had been killed, but never published their names, Akhmedinejad told Iranians in the holy city of Qom.
[00:45:21.382 --> 00:45:22.742]  Under the pretext, they have the U.S.
[00:45:22.762 --> 00:45:27.205]  attacked Afghanistan and Iraq, and since then a million people have been killed, only in Iraq, which is true.
[00:45:27.746 --> 00:45:32.409]  Speaking Wednesday at a news conference on the Iran threat, Netanyahu compared Akhmedinejad to Hitler,
[00:45:33.309 --> 00:45:42.573]  No, the Iranians never funded Hitler to go after the Jews like the Zionists did, and linked Tehran's nuclear program to threats that Nazis posed in Europe in the late 1930s.
[00:45:44.326 --> 00:45:56.776]  Netanyahu said Iran differed from Nazis, in one vital respect, explaining that where the Nazi regime embarked on global conflict before it developed nuclear weapons, he said, this regime, Iran, is developing nuclear weapons before it embarks on global conflict.
[00:45:57.157 --> 00:46:01.560]  Meanwhile, they're eight years away from a nuke, if left alone, and they're not even building one now.
[00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:02.741]  That's if they start.
[00:46:03.061 --> 00:46:12.109]  Meanwhile, Pakistan's got a bunch of nukes about to be taken over by Wahhabi and Saudi Arabians, run by the CIA, and nobody's worried about that, as they threaten to attack peaceful India.
[00:46:15.276 --> 00:46:16.998]  I mean, can you put two and two together here?
[00:46:17.598 --> 00:46:19.921]  Can you put two and two together here, my friends?
[00:46:22.323 --> 00:46:23.224]  And the story goes on.
[00:46:23.264 --> 00:46:26.387]  It's up on JonesReport.com if you want to see the rest of it.
[00:46:27.909 --> 00:46:28.669]  Where's the other one here?
[00:46:28.709 --> 00:46:33.494]  This is out of Newsmax, which is basically a semi-neocon run publication.
[00:46:34.867 --> 00:46:35.467]  Source, U.S.
[00:46:35.507 --> 00:46:42.831]  strike on Iran nearing, contrary to some claims, that the Bush administration will allow diplomacy to handle Iran's nuclear weapons program.
[00:46:42.851 --> 00:46:48.274]  A leading member of the American Jewish community tells Newsmax that the military strike is not only on the table, but likely.
[00:46:48.754 --> 00:47:02.181]  Israel is preparing for heavy casualties, the source said, suggesting that although Israel will not take part in the strike, it is expected to be the target of Iranian retribution, which will be called terrorism.
[00:47:03.188 --> 00:47:07.610]  Newsmax has got that thing where they refresh every five minutes to get more hits.
[00:47:07.650 --> 00:47:08.091]  We don't do that.
[00:47:08.111 --> 00:47:09.871]  We want real statistics, not fake ones.
[00:47:09.911 --> 00:47:11.172]  Just did that refresh thing that does
[00:47:32.623 --> 00:47:36.867]  An Iranian attack will prompt a severe reaction from Israel which will destroy the Iranian nation, he said.
[00:47:38.228 --> 00:47:51.179]  When Israel was conducting the largest homeland home front military exercise in its history last week, Israel's National Infrastructure Minister Benjamin Ben Elitzer warned Tehran about expected attacks on the Jewish state.
[00:47:51.619 --> 00:47:56.363]  An Iranian attack will prompt a severe reaction from Israel which will destroy the Iranian nation, he said.
[00:47:56.863 --> 00:47:58.545]  Yeah, they're going to nuke it from end to end.
[00:48:00.031 --> 00:48:02.334]  This is what I see happening if they do go into Iran.
[00:48:02.354 --> 00:48:09.205]  I'm not saying it's going to happen, but they've certainly got the safety off the gun to the head, and they're starting to squeeze the trigger thinking about it.
[00:48:10.114 --> 00:48:18.801]  There's no doubt with all the aircraft carriers for five months waiting and troops mass and more troops going into Iraq and building up on the border and Al-Qaeda forces under U.S.
[00:48:18.841 --> 00:48:29.228]  command publicly, they just admit it in the newspaper, Al-Qaeda forces, Saudi Arabian, Wahhabi forces attacking the Iranians, blowing things up, bombing mosques inside Iran.
[00:48:29.609 --> 00:48:32.251]  Iran tries to play it down and ignore it so they don't look weak.
[00:48:32.871 --> 00:48:34.412]  That's just been happening the last few days.
[00:48:35.632 --> 00:48:38.374]  That if this happens, you're probably going to see Iran.
[00:48:38.414 --> 00:48:39.474]  They've been very shrewd.
[00:48:39.494 --> 00:48:51.622]  You're going to probably see Iran go ahead and just take the bombardment, which will be politically damaging, but they have no other choice, though they've made some threats.
[00:48:51.642 --> 00:48:55.384]  And then Israel will go ahead and may set off a nuke.
[00:48:56.285 --> 00:48:57.505]  It'll be some small town.
[00:48:57.525 --> 00:49:01.448]  They'll claim some palace, or a dirty bomb, or they'll blow up something.
[00:49:01.488 --> 00:49:04.590]  I mean, it's a very good chance Mossad will do this, or Shin Bet.
[00:49:05.490 --> 00:49:12.152]  And then they will just nuke Iran, and we've had members of the Knesset say they'll nuke Europe if they don't go along, and the U.S.
[00:49:12.172 --> 00:49:20.375]  responds by handing them more nukes, and half the Israelis don't like it, but they can't really unelect the government because they do a parliamentary manipulation.
[00:49:20.715 --> 00:49:22.796]  If a Prime Minister is against it, they get assassinated.
[00:49:23.716 --> 00:49:24.736]  And it's just hell on earth.
[00:49:24.796 --> 00:49:26.097]  It's how the new world order operates.
[00:49:28.384 --> 00:49:29.485]  It just never ends.
[00:49:29.505 --> 00:49:35.792]  They've got to have World War III because everybody's waking up to them, so they've got to escalate to an even bigger level inside the New World Order.
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:39.881]  Meanwhile, a lot of rich Jews are fleeing Israel.
[00:49:40.421 --> 00:49:42.702]  It's a reverse of a trend we've seen in the last 50 years.
[00:49:43.223 --> 00:49:47.545]  To France, to Paris, but mainly to London.
[00:49:48.105 --> 00:49:50.746]  And they're buying, you know, 100 million pound homes and things.
[00:49:50.766 --> 00:49:51.867]  That was in the news last few weeks.
[00:49:51.927 --> 00:49:54.228]  In fact, Israel's richest man left.
[00:49:54.728 --> 00:49:56.149]  He's even selling his homes in Israel.
[00:49:57.209 --> 00:49:57.869]  What do they know?
[00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:01.251]  I think that they're going to blow the hell out of Israel.
[00:50:01.911 --> 00:50:02.852]  The more I think about it.
[00:50:03.452 --> 00:50:05.753]  And it's not going to be Arabs or the Persians doing it.
[00:50:09.264 --> 00:50:15.310]  You know, I got ten phone calls I want to take, and it has been four days in.
[00:50:15.711 --> 00:50:27.703]  I wanted to cover this Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and I just don't have, you know, I'll have tons of energy like in an hour, but I always when I get off air after three hours kind of just go ugh for about ten minutes, and just sit in a chair and drink a big glass of water.
[00:50:28.184 --> 00:50:30.867]  Doing this fourth hour hadn't been getting to me, but today it's kind of hammering me.
[00:50:30.887 --> 00:50:31.347]  I'm kind of like,
[00:50:32.159 --> 00:50:34.441]  We're dingy a little bit.
[00:50:34.601 --> 00:50:36.522]  So I'm not going to cover this today.
[00:50:36.822 --> 00:50:39.864]  I'm going to start the show with this unless there's some huge news, which there always is.
[00:50:40.645 --> 00:50:42.466]  So here it is in the document cam.
[00:50:43.707 --> 00:50:46.909]  Oh, Al Qaeda will get us.
[00:50:47.849 --> 00:50:51.072]  People will say on YouTube that's a secret devil code I'm sending out to get them.
[00:50:51.652 --> 00:50:54.294]  No, I'm saying it's a boogeyman that they threaten you with with Al Qaeda.
[00:50:56.095 --> 00:50:57.376]  Look, I even gave him a sword.
[00:51:03.891 --> 00:51:07.674]  I don't know.
[00:51:08.035 --> 00:51:08.395]  I don't know.
[00:51:08.455 --> 00:51:08.735]  I don't know.
[00:51:31.374 --> 00:51:35.015]  Hey man, I want to say I love your show.
[00:51:35.075 --> 00:51:37.936]  I want to say that I did something here about a month ago.
[00:51:37.956 --> 00:51:42.038]  I took one of the copies of Endgame and donated it to the local
[00:52:00.418 --> 00:52:01.298]  Good!
[00:52:02.459 --> 00:52:07.283]  That way 50 people can see it in its average rental life and give one to the library.
[00:52:07.303 --> 00:52:09.624]  You know, just anything you can to fight these terrorists.
[00:52:10.085 --> 00:52:11.366]  Our library already has one.
[00:52:11.406 --> 00:52:12.326]  It's pretty cool.
[00:52:12.346 --> 00:52:14.788]  The reason I called, I wanted to ask you why.
[00:52:14.828 --> 00:52:16.269]  I haven't really heard you mention it.
[00:52:16.289 --> 00:52:20.873]  I know you had Jeffrey Smith on and I thank you for that because that really turned me on to a lot of stuff.
[00:52:21.553 --> 00:52:24.295]  But I'm really getting into this Morgellons disease.
[00:52:24.535 --> 00:52:26.317]  I know there was a conference out there on the 29th.
[00:52:28.179 --> 00:52:33.529]  And, uh, you know, there's 830 Texans reportedly, uh, infected with this disease.
[00:52:34.271 --> 00:52:35.854]  And I haven't heard you mention anything about it.
[00:52:35.874 --> 00:52:37.717]  I wonder what your thoughts were about it.
[00:52:38.550 --> 00:52:42.812]  You know, there's all sorts of biological accidents that have gotten out.
[00:52:42.852 --> 00:52:44.673]  There's all these hundreds of new diseases.
[00:52:44.693 --> 00:52:48.794]  I mean, they called microplasm fake for a decade and then admitted it was real.
[00:52:49.435 --> 00:52:51.856]  They called Gulf War illness fake and then admitted it was real.
[00:52:51.896 --> 00:52:59.119]  And major institutes like, and I appreciate your call, I'm getting an echo, like MD Anderson and others went in and checked it and found it was true.
[00:52:59.179 --> 00:53:03.301]  And I think there's a lot of people that really are affected by something weird.
[00:53:04.241 --> 00:53:11.402]  These fibers and things growing in them, but I've seen evidence in medical facilities in Oklahoma and universities and others have said something's going on.
[00:53:11.923 --> 00:53:21.985]  But then there's schizophrenics who, you know, show up and say, look, it's in me, and they're picking their face until it's bloody, and look, look, that's a satellite following me and it's the sun.
[00:53:22.005 --> 00:53:24.085]  I mean, that's uncommon.
[00:53:24.105 --> 00:53:26.966]  They think the moon or sun or streetlights are out to kill them.
[00:53:31.058 --> 00:53:33.960]  Schizophrenics have always been paranoid.
[00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:36.241]  Schizophrenics particularly have always thought people are after them.
[00:53:37.842 --> 00:53:44.465]  And then I think that adds a cover for people that are really under my control, real programs they admit are happening, and real people that have real sicknesses.
[00:53:44.505 --> 00:53:51.308]  I mean, hell, you can be in a car wreck and have broken vertebrae now, and your back's totally fried, and the HMOs try to give you Prozac and say everything's fine.
[00:53:52.229 --> 00:53:55.431]  And if the doctors don't go along with it, they fire them out of these HMO clinics.
[00:53:56.653 --> 00:53:59.574]  And medicine's transferring over to that, so it's all bad.
[00:53:59.914 --> 00:54:01.435]  I don't doubt there's stuff we don't know about.
[00:54:02.355 --> 00:54:11.499]  I know this, though, we're not having more Gellons conferences about the fact that all the mammals they feed these GMO foods to die, and then they're feeding them to us and now everybody's getting sick.
[00:54:13.379 --> 00:54:16.961]  I mean, you know, there's big stuff I know, big crises I know.
[00:54:17.821 --> 00:54:18.841]  I know we were 1 in 33 died of cancer.
[00:54:21.587 --> 00:54:23.948]  Decades ago and now it's one in three about to be one in two.
[00:54:25.209 --> 00:54:28.830]  I know that it was one out of a couple thousand got diabetes and now it's one out of three.
[00:54:29.731 --> 00:54:30.851]  And it isn't just corn syrup.
[00:54:30.871 --> 00:54:32.452]  I mean, there's a lot of stuff going on.
[00:54:32.512 --> 00:54:33.532]  Steven, Utah, go ahead.
[00:54:34.273 --> 00:54:35.633]  Hey, what's up, Alex?
[00:54:36.273 --> 00:54:40.195]  Thank you, God bless you, and doing an excellent job.
[00:54:41.896 --> 00:54:44.977]  Just wanted to say those and just give you encouragement.
[00:54:45.037 --> 00:54:45.838]  Don't get down.
[00:54:46.098 --> 00:54:47.959]  Don't think people aren't listening.
[00:54:48.059 --> 00:54:48.859]  I'm not down.
[00:54:48.919 --> 00:54:49.439]  I'm not down.
[00:54:49.479 --> 00:54:50.920]  I'm a workaholic and I work too much.
[00:54:51.956 --> 00:54:56.077]  Thank you, though.
[00:54:56.097 --> 00:55:06.159]  Yeah, we do nothing just because maybe it's written a certain way that, yeah, this is going to happen, this is supposed to happen, and we're just supposed to let it happen.
[00:55:06.179 --> 00:55:07.139]  I think that's a sin.
[00:55:07.619 --> 00:55:15.041]  God gave us brains, God gave us muscle, and if we don't use it, that's ultimately a sin.
[00:55:15.661 --> 00:55:21.122]  And I like to hit the AM radios in the evening and talk about 9-11 and talk about other things
[00:55:21.857 --> 00:55:31.265]  You know, kind of pertain to this type of issue, and lately I've been on the website trying to debunk the 9-11, trying to debunk what you say, and it hasn't been working.
[00:55:31.325 --> 00:55:33.587]  So, good work, and thank you very much.
[00:55:33.607 --> 00:55:34.908]  Thank you, I appreciate it, Steve.
[00:55:34.928 --> 00:55:37.590]  Yeah, I recommend you try to debunk the things I say.
[00:55:38.831 --> 00:55:45.297]  Because, you know, a lot of times I'll say, like in a week, I'll say, Benjamin Netanyahu came out and said 9-11 helped Israel.
[00:55:47.574 --> 00:55:50.357]  And I'll get emails saying, you liar, how dare you do that?
[00:55:51.018 --> 00:55:53.341]  And then, used to, I'd even try to email the person in the article.
[00:55:53.361 --> 00:55:54.542]  I don't have time for that now.
[00:55:54.602 --> 00:55:57.846]  Dig it up, send it to them, and they usually F you back, or, you know.
[00:56:00.009 --> 00:56:05.653]  You know, I don't always source everything I say here, like this is some college treatise, but I do source most of it.
[00:56:06.093 --> 00:56:14.339]  You know, like in a month, I'll say, yeah, Philip Bobbitt at UT, one of the top neocon strategists, he called for getting rid of the Constitution, Bill of Rights, and preemptive war.
[00:56:14.379 --> 00:56:17.301]  People say, I want to see the documentation on that.
[00:56:18.442 --> 00:56:19.062]  Well, okay.
[00:56:19.763 --> 00:56:20.283]  Here it is.
[00:56:21.484 --> 00:56:23.485]  Everything must go, including the Constitution.
[00:56:24.543 --> 00:56:32.387]  And that's in the Statesman, but it's not my job, I've already shown that like five times today and five times yesterday, with the date, to always give it to you.
[00:56:32.427 --> 00:56:33.428]  Just go look it up for yourself.
[00:56:34.168 --> 00:56:35.269]  Find out I'm telling you the truth.
[00:56:36.649 --> 00:56:37.930]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:39.671]  David in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:56:40.779 --> 00:56:41.139]  Hello.
[00:56:41.319 --> 00:56:41.620]  Hi.
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:48.506]  I was going to point out that thing about Barack Obama, made those recent comments criticizing rural, moderate voters.
[00:56:48.786 --> 00:56:52.449]  Yeah, I mean, all elitists hate religious gun owners.
[00:56:52.469 --> 00:56:53.130]  They hate our guys.
[00:56:53.330 --> 00:57:04.520]  Did you notice that, look at the things he described, people who are moderate to conservative, rural or small town, are religious, Christians mostly, and or who own guns.
[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:07.983]  Now, who are some famous Americans who meet those descriptions?
[00:57:08.464 --> 00:57:12.566]  Like Thomas Jefferson and George Washington, maybe, and most of the Founding Fathers?
[00:57:12.586 --> 00:57:13.386]  Well, it's more than that.
[00:57:13.426 --> 00:57:19.348]  Remember Janet Reno on 60 Minutes saying all Christians are cult members and enemies of the government?
[00:57:19.388 --> 00:57:27.212]  I mean, and then they defended her, and then you've got FBI training manuals they give the police saying those that talk about the Constitution are terrorists.
[00:57:27.252 --> 00:57:28.492]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[00:57:28.852 --> 00:57:31.393]  I've got FEMA on tape saying the Founding Fathers were bad.
[00:57:31.413 --> 00:57:34.675]  I mean, look, here's Philip Bobbitt in The Statesman
[00:57:35.709 --> 00:57:38.230]  Saying, get rid of the Constitution, get rid of freedom.
[00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:39.351]  I've met that guy.
[00:57:39.371 --> 00:57:41.132]  He's a real piece of work.
[00:57:41.152 --> 00:57:41.952]  I don't agree with him.
[00:57:42.012 --> 00:57:42.872]  I'm with you.
[00:57:42.952 --> 00:57:45.013]  But I mean, they say how to fight terrorism.
[00:57:45.314 --> 00:57:46.354]  Get rid of the Constitution.
[00:57:46.674 --> 00:57:49.035]  But I mean, they're right out in the open.
[00:57:49.075 --> 00:57:49.916]  They're the enemy.
[00:57:50.296 --> 00:57:50.636]  They are.
[00:57:50.716 --> 00:57:51.536]  We need to get back.
[00:57:51.837 --> 00:57:55.078]  I'm the guy, I don't know if you've heard me, I've called some other shows in the years a couple times.
[00:57:55.498 --> 00:57:57.239]  We need to get back to more constitutional government.
[00:57:57.259 --> 00:58:01.141]  I have some ideas of proposed amendments to try and make the Constitution work better.
[00:58:01.621 --> 00:58:05.403]  Reforming the Electoral College, term limits, balanced budget amendments, hard asset money.
[00:58:06.167 --> 00:58:07.468]  Uh, getting rid of the Federal Reserve.
[00:58:08.288 --> 00:58:10.890]  Uh, having the state legislature pick senators again.
[00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:12.671]  And, uh, several other things.
[00:58:12.691 --> 00:58:13.652]  Getting rid of the income tax.
[00:58:14.632 --> 00:58:17.334]  I even call for getting rid of property, what's called property tax.
[00:58:17.414 --> 00:58:19.115]  It's really a property assessment tax.
[00:58:19.535 --> 00:58:19.935]  I hear ya.
[00:58:19.975 --> 00:58:20.956]  I gotta jump now.
[00:58:21.016 --> 00:58:22.297]  I wanna just jam in a few more.
[00:58:22.317 --> 00:58:22.737]  Alright.
[00:58:22.797 --> 00:58:23.638]  David in Texas.
[00:58:23.678 --> 00:58:23.998]  Thank you.
[00:58:24.038 --> 00:58:24.718]  David, go ahead.
[00:58:25.739 --> 00:58:26.720]  Or Chris in Louisiana.
[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:27.680]  Go ahead.
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:28.661]  Okay, or whoever.
[00:58:28.801 --> 00:58:29.421]  It's moving around.
[00:58:29.461 --> 00:58:30.202]  Go ahead, Chris.
[00:58:31.345 --> 00:58:31.885]  Hey, Alex.
[00:58:33.025 --> 00:58:40.387]  I went to Baton Rouge, Louisiana the other day at State Capitol for the April 15th tax strike that was supposed to occur nationwide.
[00:58:41.587 --> 00:58:45.608]  I was very disheartened because no one showed up.
[00:58:46.488 --> 00:58:50.668]  So myself and two friends, we went down to the local IRS office.
[00:58:51.189 --> 00:58:56.409]  It was in the JTS building near Corporate Boulevard in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
[00:58:57.430 --> 00:58:58.990]  And I went in there, Alex, and
[00:59:00.347 --> 00:59:03.328]  We had no signs or placards, nothing on our shirts, nothing.
[00:59:03.368 --> 00:59:05.950]  We were just clean cut looking young men.
[00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:12.973]  We go in there and my friends start passing out pamphlets to the people in line.
[00:59:13.713 --> 00:59:16.655]  And I went, I didn't do anything, I didn't have any pamphlets or anything.
[00:59:19.176 --> 00:59:25.298]  So I go to a lady and she's working behind her desk and I say, excuse me ma'am, my name's Chris.
[00:59:26.877 --> 00:59:30.982]  I have some questions about the constitutional legality of the income tax.
[00:59:31.722 --> 00:59:40.272]  And I would just like someone to show me the law that requires Americans to pay an income tax or direct me somewhere where I can get more information on that.
[00:59:40.432 --> 00:59:42.394]  And I was exceedingly polite with her.
[00:59:42.414 --> 00:59:43.495]  I was very well-mannered.
[00:59:43.515 --> 00:59:45.978]  And acted like you were all kind of.
[00:59:46.779 --> 00:59:47.920]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:59:48.379 --> 00:59:51.841]  So, she says, okay, go sit down, we'll have somebody be with you.
[00:59:51.861 --> 00:59:54.322]  What do you think this whole shifting of society is about?
[00:59:54.362 --> 00:59:58.845]  It's not for the figment of imagination, Al-Qaeda boogeyman.
[00:59:58.905 --> 01:00:03.147]  It's not for this creature.
[01:00:03.988 --> 01:00:05.268]  It is for you.
[01:00:06.209 --> 01:00:07.710]  I'm part of our active duty army.
[01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:10.031]  I mean, I was in an airborne unit.
[01:00:10.071 --> 01:00:10.891]  I was infantry.
[01:00:11.932 --> 01:00:14.794]  I mean, I've honorably served my country.
[01:00:15.074 --> 01:00:16.415]  When they're done, you're going to be Al-Qaeda.
[01:00:16.455 --> 01:00:17.035]  I'm not kidding.
[01:00:18.092 --> 01:00:20.855]  And so anyways, so they sit me down.
[01:00:20.875 --> 01:00:21.616]  I get up.
[01:00:21.676 --> 01:00:22.537]  This lady comes out.
[01:00:22.597 --> 01:00:23.819]  She's furious, right?
[01:00:23.899 --> 01:00:25.040]  I mean, we're not loud.
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:25.781]  We're not yelling.
[01:00:25.801 --> 01:00:26.982]  We're not arguing nothing.
[01:00:27.283 --> 01:00:28.264]  I mean, I'm just sitting there.
[01:00:28.825 --> 01:00:29.585]  She comes out.
[01:00:30.046 --> 01:00:32.108]  He says, I need to speak with you outside, sir.
[01:00:32.168 --> 01:00:33.390]  So we walk outside the doors.
[01:00:33.891 --> 01:00:35.552]  And she says, you need to leave immediately.
[01:00:35.572 --> 01:00:40.654]  And all of a sudden, there's this big, black, strapping, muscled-up fellow with his hand on a revolver.
[01:00:40.994 --> 01:00:41.875]  And I'm just in there.
[01:00:41.915 --> 01:00:44.116]  I said, letty, I'm not trying to cause any problems.
[01:00:44.576 --> 01:00:45.857]  I'm just trying to get some information.
[01:00:45.877 --> 01:00:48.858]  In the near future, you're going to go to a facility, Chris.
[01:00:49.618 --> 01:00:50.139]  Exactly.
[01:00:50.439 --> 01:00:52.020]  It's not whether the income tax...
[01:00:53.613 --> 01:00:55.074]  I was at a neutral position.
[01:00:55.114 --> 01:00:56.455]  I don't know whether it's legal or not.
[01:00:56.515 --> 01:00:59.896]  I think the 16th Amendment removes the 14th Amendment requirement.
[01:00:59.916 --> 01:01:00.797]  No, no, it's not legal.
[01:01:00.837 --> 01:01:01.797]  Look, there's no doubt.
[01:01:01.857 --> 01:01:02.398]  I've studied it.
[01:01:02.758 --> 01:01:03.498]  It is a fraud.
[01:01:03.558 --> 01:01:05.079]  Not one cent goes to run the country.
[01:01:05.439 --> 01:01:07.821]  It is a tax right to the Rothschilds, period.
[01:01:08.641 --> 01:01:11.763]  But the legality of it, though... Totally illegal.
[01:01:13.263 --> 01:01:16.005]  Is it technically legal in the sense that they pass the 16th Amendment?
[01:01:16.045 --> 01:01:17.886]  It's technically legal as they'll come kill you.
[01:01:19.304 --> 01:01:21.346]  It's technically legal, they'll put you in prison.
[01:01:21.366 --> 01:01:25.852]  They escorted me immediately off the premises, and I was very polite with them.
[01:01:25.972 --> 01:01:28.254]  And I mean, I just said, okay ma'am, I'm gonna leave.
[01:01:28.635 --> 01:01:35.523]  But if the IRS is, you know, taxing us, why don't they just have a little, okay, we have a pamphlet in our office and it explains
[01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:37.791]  Common Tax Protester, Minister.
[01:01:37.871 --> 01:01:39.693]  Or why can't they open the book and look at the show?
[01:01:39.713 --> 01:01:47.618]  Because they never ratify the 16th Amendment and a income tax is unconstitutional according to sections of the Constitution.
[01:01:47.959 --> 01:01:49.059]  And they brought it in in 1913.
[01:01:49.199 --> 01:01:50.420]  I appreciate your call.
[01:01:50.801 --> 01:01:55.824]  And they always bring up these lines about, oh well, we wouldn't be able to build the country without this.
[01:01:56.224 --> 01:01:57.846]  We didn't have it until 1913.
[01:01:58.206 --> 01:02:01.888]  It wasn't more than 1% until the end of World War II.
[01:02:02.389 --> 01:02:03.009]  So we've had it 60 years.
[01:02:05.643 --> 01:02:09.286]  We've had it 60 years, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:11.148 --> 01:02:11.548]  Okay?
[01:02:12.389 --> 01:02:15.772]  By the way, they raised the tax brackets this year and didn't even tell anybody.
[01:02:17.033 --> 01:02:19.214]  In fact, I'm looking at my guys outside the studio.
[01:02:19.495 --> 01:02:21.777]  Did you know they raised the tax brackets for everybody this year?
[01:02:22.177 --> 01:02:22.998]  And didn't even tell anybody?
[01:02:23.218 --> 01:02:25.460]  See, now they increase taxes and don't even tell you.
[01:02:26.881 --> 01:02:30.324]  Now people say, well you're a coward, why don't you then not pay them if it's a fraud?
[01:02:31.305 --> 01:02:32.686]  Because I'm choosing my battles.
[01:02:34.571 --> 01:02:36.672]  I mean, I can't stay out of their crosshairs.
[01:02:36.712 --> 01:02:40.934]  I went five miles over the speed limit and got pulled over, and the cops said, yeah, you were going five over.
[01:02:42.055 --> 01:02:42.955]  Next it'll be one.
[01:02:42.975 --> 01:02:44.916]  Next it'll be a $50,000 fine.
[01:02:45.157 --> 01:02:47.938]  Hell, they're trying to take your license now if you get three tickets in three years.
[01:02:48.778 --> 01:02:59.144]  It's all about, you're the slave, you're the scum, you are to be abused, you're to be sucked off of, while there's TV ads and billboards and radio ads worshiping government and how wonderful it is.
[01:02:59.504 --> 01:03:02.326]  That's how we live, that's what we're under, that's what it is.
[01:03:03.410 --> 01:03:04.871]  Land of the Cowards, Home of the Slaves.
[01:03:07.894 --> 01:03:09.215]  Keith in Kentucky, go ahead.
[01:03:10.135 --> 01:03:11.757]  Hey Alex, nice speaking to you again.
[01:03:11.817 --> 01:03:13.978]  Been on the show once before, really love your work.
[01:03:14.199 --> 01:03:14.879]  Welcome, my friend.
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:17.121]  Well, welcome indeed.
[01:03:18.062 --> 01:03:24.367]  I am a good buddy with a fella here who's a freedom fighter such as yourself, who's very vocal.
[01:03:24.947 --> 01:03:32.033]  And we've come to the conclusion that it's about time somebody just sued the IRS and civil court and had them show in court where
[01:03:32.543 --> 01:03:36.404]  You're not responsible for your taxes, or for where you're responsible for them.
[01:03:37.024 --> 01:03:43.806]  And then if they can't do it, then in civil court, wouldn't a judge have to award you the back taxes, or the taxes you've already paid in?
[01:03:44.906 --> 01:03:55.989]  Well, I hate to rain on your parade, but there have been tens of thousands of suits against the IRS, probably hundreds of thousands, and hundreds along those lines.
[01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:58.290]  You have to wait... Well, I'm not trying to argue.
[01:03:58.550 --> 01:04:01.751]  The whole point isn't to argue that you owe the tax, or that you
[01:04:02.712 --> 01:04:13.837]  Uh, are obligated to pay the taxes, it's for them to show you documentation of where... Well, no, that's been done, but people sue them on the fact that filling out the forms makes you waive your Fifth Amendment right.
[01:04:14.418 --> 01:04:17.619]  I mean, an axe murderer doesn't have to incriminate themselves, but you have to.
[01:04:18.319 --> 01:04:21.161]  And the point is, is they have their own courts is the problem.
[01:04:21.997 --> 01:04:23.738]  Yeah, I'm very aware of that.
[01:04:24.258 --> 01:04:25.718]  And it shows the political problem.
[01:04:25.738 --> 01:04:31.000]  But I agree, the suit should continue, the educational process should continue.
[01:04:32.701 --> 01:04:38.783]  Here's one thing about our state versus a lot of states, is out here where I am, everybody is armed, okay?
[01:04:39.344 --> 01:04:46.626]  We have one of the lowest crime rates in the country, yet prescription drug issues just are killing our area.
[01:04:46.667 --> 01:04:47.767]  Like, everybody around here
[01:04:48.457 --> 01:04:56.244]  Just about pick something up their nose made by some pharmaceutical company that's controlled by some neocon butthole.
[01:04:57.865 --> 01:05:04.791]  And yet we can't get any legislation in our state, even though our Senators tell us that they're going to pass this legislation, none of them make an effort to.
[01:05:06.392 --> 01:05:07.513]  What say you to that issue?
[01:05:08.294 --> 01:05:10.395]  Well, they're bought and paid for, and I appreciate your call.
[01:05:11.496 --> 01:05:14.059]  Speaking of the devil, the polygamous sect
[01:05:15.511 --> 01:05:18.273]  I mean, you've got Africans moving in here who have two or three wives.
[01:05:18.293 --> 01:05:21.055]  You've got Saudi Arabians living all over New York and you name it.
[01:05:21.415 --> 01:05:23.716]  They've got 10 or 15 wives in their big penthouses.
[01:05:25.658 --> 01:05:29.200]  They fly our women out and basically make them sex slaves over there and our children.
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:30.401]  But that's okay.
[01:05:30.441 --> 01:05:31.922]  They raid this polygamous sect.
[01:05:32.879 --> 01:05:37.984]  And there's not, you know, any real allegations of child abuse unless you believe the 16-year-old thing.
[01:05:38.004 --> 01:05:38.925]  They're obviously weird.
[01:05:39.885 --> 01:05:45.270]  But the point is that CPS just takes all their kids where they're five times more likely to actually be abused.
[01:05:45.851 --> 01:05:48.013]  And those kids they took, there's no allegations of abuse.
[01:05:48.033 --> 01:05:49.634]  The CPS says you'll never see them again.
[01:05:50.054 --> 01:05:50.955]  No judge, no jury.
[01:05:50.975 --> 01:05:51.696]  They're just God.
[01:05:53.137 --> 01:05:56.720]  But Pentagon funds AIDS, polygamous sect.
[01:05:57.702 --> 01:06:01.864]  Millions and millions of dollars for aircraft parts, you name it, up until 2006.
[01:06:02.325 --> 01:06:18.874]  And that's how, and I'm not going to get into a Mormon bashing fest here, it's just that that's how it works, is with any of these little groups, these mafias, and I'm not saying the Mormons are a mafia, I'm saying some groups within it operate like that.
[01:06:19.714 --> 01:06:22.115]  They give each other all these contracts.
[01:06:22.156 --> 01:06:26.298]  I mean, it was five Mormons on the AXS TV board trying to take it down.
[01:06:28.142 --> 01:06:31.418]  in Austin, and Mormons are less than two percent in Austin.
[01:06:32.133 --> 01:06:36.334]  You know, they were bringing their people in, and I ran into that there, and I don't appreciate it.
[01:06:36.374 --> 01:06:38.155]  Now, if other Mormons don't like that, that's good.
[01:06:38.595 --> 01:06:40.816]  They should speak up against it and expose it.
[01:06:41.436 --> 01:06:43.217]  But pretty weird little twist there.
[01:06:43.997 --> 01:06:44.477]  You know what?
[01:06:44.537 --> 01:06:48.098]  I'm just going to go ahead and end transmission with Robert in Washington.
[01:06:48.679 --> 01:06:50.799]  I can't go to... Well, I want to go to a woman.
[01:06:50.879 --> 01:06:53.020]  I think I had one woman call today.
[01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:54.400]  Oh, fine.
[01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:56.161]  We'll go to Brandy in Dallas, then we'll go to Robert.
[01:06:56.181 --> 01:06:58.102]  I don't want to jip him and John, but let's be quick.
[01:06:58.502 --> 01:06:59.202]  Brandy, welcome.
[01:06:59.222 --> 01:06:59.842]  Thanks for calling.
[01:07:00.102 --> 01:07:00.763]  Thank you, sir.
[01:07:00.823 --> 01:07:01.743]  I'm glad to be on.
[01:07:02.290 --> 01:07:09.831]  I just wanted to give a little tip for the caller that called earlier about his 9-11 DVDs hanging them on his neighbor's mailboxes.
[01:07:11.046 --> 01:07:18.350]  I learned doing canned food drives that it's actually a federal offense to use a mailbox without postage on whatever it is you're delivering.
[01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:22.872]  And if you're hanging a deal about pizza coupons, it's okay, or about your church, it's fine.
[01:07:22.892 --> 01:07:26.634]  Well, you have to put it on the front door or rubber band it to a front gate or something.
[01:07:26.674 --> 01:07:29.796]  I was about to say, but they will SWAT team you if it's Patriot info.
[01:07:30.056 --> 01:07:32.117]  That's right, and you can get up to a $300 fine per piece.
[01:07:34.753 --> 01:07:35.953]  of mail that you put.
[01:07:35.973 --> 01:07:38.014]  Because that's the federal property slave.
[01:07:38.334 --> 01:07:40.614]  Right, because we don't own our own mailboxes or anything.
[01:07:42.474 --> 01:07:43.514]  Well, that was the tip.
[01:07:44.375 --> 01:07:45.195]  Thank you so much.
[01:07:45.235 --> 01:07:46.695]  I appreciate that call, Brandi.
[01:07:47.595 --> 01:07:48.995]  Let's talk to Robert in Washington.
[01:07:49.015 --> 01:07:49.576]  You're on the air.
[01:07:49.596 --> 01:07:50.916]  Oh, Alex?
[01:07:51.156 --> 01:07:51.356]  Yeah.
[01:07:52.156 --> 01:07:52.876]  Oh, awesome, awesome.
[01:07:52.916 --> 01:07:55.877]  I've been listening to you for about five and a half years, ever since I saw Headline News.
[01:07:55.977 --> 01:08:03.278]  Somebody was trying to... They were talking about 9-1-1, and they'd mentioned your name, and talking about what a conspiracy nut you were, and that only encouraged me to look up your name.
[01:08:04.628 --> 01:08:13.152]  From there I found somebody had posted Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, and I watched that from some file sharing network, and ever since then I've just been hooked.
[01:08:13.192 --> 01:08:21.595]  I've been sharing it with my neighbors, who's one's a minister, just everybody, you know, my brother, my family, just my dad, everybody, and it's just been amazing.
[01:08:21.915 --> 01:08:24.937]  Thank you for your work, and we're waking people up out here.
[01:08:24.957 --> 01:08:27.658]  That was in Idaho, northern Idaho, five, six years ago.
[01:08:28.379 --> 01:08:31.781]  Hey Alex, what do you think about Amish already being above the tyranny?
[01:08:55.066 --> 01:09:03.809]  Well, the Amish aren't above the tyranny, they're now CPSing their children, they're now squeezing and harassing them, and ignoring the age-old conventions to leave them alone.
[01:09:04.769 --> 01:09:11.551]  Now, it shows that most of this tyranny is opted into and then made common law, like vaccinations and the rest of it, so they haven't been within that.
[01:09:12.131 --> 01:09:15.072]  But they are going after the Amish more and more, and I think that's wrong.
[01:09:15.412 --> 01:09:20.514]  Just like they should leave the Amish and the Native Americans alone, they should leave all of us alone, but they want to suck off of us.
[01:09:21.345 --> 01:09:30.212]  Well don't you think that us in the Infowars movement could learn a lot about the Amish
[01:09:32.074 --> 01:09:34.716]  Really become above the tyranny?
[01:09:34.776 --> 01:09:39.498]  Your ways are very powerful.
[01:09:55.467 --> 01:10:03.257]  If you'll just tell your friends and neighbors and co-workers to tune in, whether it's on the AM or FM shortwave internet, we will continue to reach more people and cover these serious issues.
[01:10:03.837 --> 01:10:10.546]  I mean, a lot of what we do is just cover the serious news, and it's nothing special, but not many people do that, so this show is special.
[01:10:11.627 --> 01:10:13.449]  Thanks to the crew, everybody, John Harmon.
[01:10:15.489 --> 01:10:16.469]  Paul Martin in there.
[01:10:17.490 --> 01:10:19.491]  We've also got Bermas out there.
[01:10:20.111 --> 01:10:22.292]  Kurt Nemo's about to leave the InfoPad.
[01:10:22.612 --> 01:10:23.652]  Really appreciate him.
[01:10:24.133 --> 01:10:25.913]  God bless you all, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:10:26.213 --> 01:10:27.874]  I'll see you back live 11 a.m.
[01:10:28.354 --> 01:10:29.155]  to 4 p.m.
[01:10:29.175 --> 01:10:30.655]  11 p.m.
[01:10:30.675 --> 01:10:31.256]  to 3 p.m.
[01:10:31.276 --> 01:10:32.256]  Some days we go to 4 p.m.
[01:10:32.936 --> 01:10:33.477]  Tomorrow.
[01:10:33.497 --> 01:10:35.657]  All right, take care, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:10:36.278 --> 01:10:39.259]  And I hope you get the new film, American Drug War at Infowars.com.
[01:10:39.619 --> 01:10:41.200]  It needs to be seen!
