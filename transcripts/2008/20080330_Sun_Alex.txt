[00:00:20.018 --> 00:00:23.040]  Hillary Clinton ripping the Bush administration again.
[00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:32.427]  Clinton says the president has jeopardized national security and the ability to intervene in world crises because of the massive U.S.
[00:00:32.507 --> 00:00:34.629]  debt held partly by China.
[00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:44.275]  Democratic presidential hopeful claims the national debt of some $9 trillion puts the country at the mercy of many other nations.
[00:00:44.736 --> 00:00:47.658]  Clinton also says she is not stepping down in the race.
[00:00:48.218 --> 00:00:49.401]  This is IRN USA Radio News.
[00:01:02.557 --> 00:01:02.977]  I don't think so.
[00:01:22.538 --> 00:01:25.900]  This has really made my experience in America much better.
[00:01:26.521 --> 00:01:30.644]  And I met nice people and able to earn financial freedom.

[00:01:56.984 --> 00:02:00.829]  It's not every day that Americans look forward to hearing from the Internal Revenue Service.
[00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:05.895]  But over the past few weeks, many Americans have received a letter from the IRS with some good news.
[00:02:06.055 --> 00:02:09.599]  President Bush says the rebates, coupled with the incentives to business
[00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:10.900]  We're good to go.
[00:02:37.981 --> 00:02:46.495]  Officials say if USC doesn't remove the flag or replace it with the red and yellow striped flag of the former government of South Vietnam, there'll be protest.

[00:02:53.181 --> 00:02:58.527]  Here's a word about Israel from Dr. Jack Hayford, President of the International Church of the Four Square Gospel.
[00:02:58.567 --> 00:03:02.250]  To go to Israel is to change the way you will ever approach the Bible.
[00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.416]  The Bible becomes faced in an entirely deeper and richer way because you have been where it happened.
[00:03:08.797 --> 00:03:11.780]  You'll never be the same when you visit Israel.

[00:03:23.547 --> 00:03:29.350]  In Miami, a man is now in custody following a hostage incident at a drugstore today.
[00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.572]  Police captured the man after he crashed a getaway car.
[00:03:32.592 --> 00:03:37.774]  Authorities say the man was armed when he took the store manager hostage during an attempted robbery.
[00:03:38.155 --> 00:03:42.257]  The manager was able to escape before he could be forced into the car.
[00:03:42.317 --> 00:03:44.458]  The man did suffer minor injuries.
[00:03:45.038 --> 00:03:52.242]  With Pope Benedict set to arrive in New York next month, church officials are finding rather unique ways to honor him.
[00:03:52.842 --> 00:03:54.023]  Mike Watts explains.
[00:03:54.103 --> 00:04:00.347]  A planned gift from the Archdiocese of New York to Pope Benedict during the Pontiff's New York visit gives new meaning to the term Holy Roller.
[00:04:00.628 --> 00:04:05.451]  The Archdiocese is planning to present the Pope with a special skateboard with graphics designed by a local child.
[00:04:05.771 --> 00:04:11.435]  Dozens of young teens have entered a contest to design the skateboard, which church officials say will feature graphics with a religious theme.
[00:04:11.836 --> 00:04:21.502]  Officials say while skateboarding and the Pope don't go together in most people's minds, the church is using the contest to show that there is nothing ungodly about skateboarding and that the sport can be used to teach religious message.
[00:04:21.883 --> 00:04:22.443]  Mike Watts, New York.
[00:04:22.983 --> 00:04:30.245]  In Jacksonville, Florida, Dunkin' Donuts will offer free coffee to tax preparers and postal workers in April.

[00:06:35.163 --> 00:06:38.184]  Hello ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[00:06:38.364 --> 00:06:46.667]  It is already the March 30th, 2008, April Fool's Day, rapidly approaching everyone.
[00:06:46.687 --> 00:06:50.688]  We're gonna be live here for the next two hours.
[00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:59.371]  We have Yuki Hisa Uchida joining us, coming up to start of the next hour.
[00:07:00.031 --> 00:07:03.292]  He is on Japan's National Security Council.
[00:07:05.815 --> 00:07:19.222]  He is also the leader of Japan's second-largest party, and he has had nationwide televised hearings in the Japanese Parliament concerning 9-11 being an inside job.
[00:07:19.563 --> 00:07:24.565]  They play the clips of firefighters and police saying, get back, the government's going to blow up Building 7.
[00:07:24.625 --> 00:07:31.669]  Yeah, there's just a whole bunch of CNN, Fox clips where they say, we're gonna blow up Building 7, we'll bring it down.
[00:07:31.709 --> 00:07:33.290]  The cops say, get back, we're blowing it up.
[00:07:34.329 --> 00:07:37.091]  And they say it fell on its own, 47 story building.
[00:07:37.852 --> 00:07:41.435]  And he goes through hours of that every month now on the Japanese diet.
[00:07:42.435 --> 00:07:45.438]  And then at the Higher Council, above that.
[00:07:46.559 --> 00:07:48.460]  And it's just coming out everywhere.
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:55.766]  We have one of the most respected and longest serving, the longest serving, in the modern age, it's Mussolini.
[00:07:57.807 --> 00:08:01.390]  Served seven plus years as Italy's president, was the former head.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:02.920]  of their CIA.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.702]  He's gone public saying that criminals running our government carried out the attacks.
[00:08:07.342 --> 00:08:13.084]  A bunch of former CIA section chiefs, like Bill Christensen and others, have gone public saying it's an inside job.
[00:08:14.204 --> 00:08:22.947]  But the media is very good at only giving it attention of some Hollywood person that they think that they can attack, like, well, Oscar winner.
[00:08:23.647 --> 00:08:24.988]  This year she got Best Actress.
[00:08:25.028 --> 00:08:29.849]  She came out and talked about it, so they did focus on that in the media because she's foreign, she's French, she's a woman.
[00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:31.590]  They can try to demonize her.
[00:08:32.253 --> 00:08:59.627]  uh... but uh... you can he said fugitive will be on with us coming up uh... for about twenty or thirty minutes in at the second hour today at jim mars or before we start telegram reporter he wrote the screenplay of the film jfk he's gonna be popping in a bc news bbc nbc have come out with separate reports uh... the head of the national forensics society
[00:09:00.704 --> 00:09:05.146]  And then also one of the top doctorates in sound acoustics.
[00:09:05.666 --> 00:09:16.209]  They had a big symposium out in California a few weeks ago, documenting how Sirhan Sirhan didn't shoot RFK, 40th anniversary coming up.
[00:09:17.389 --> 00:09:26.972]  But separately, the BBC just got the films analyzed, showing four CIA operatives, one of them a section chief from Asia.
[00:09:27.573 --> 00:09:28.433]  They're in the crowd.
[00:09:29.363 --> 00:09:35.207]  They've also analyzed the gun that was used to shoot Bobby in the back.
[00:09:35.387 --> 00:09:36.548]  Of course, we always knew this.
[00:09:36.588 --> 00:09:43.773]  The LA coroner said that he was shot in the back at point-blank powder burns, not by the mental patient that they set up, Sirhan Sirhan.
[00:09:44.194 --> 00:09:46.395]  So that's coming up in about 20 minutes.
[00:09:47.496 --> 00:09:51.459]  Now, we'll take a few calls today, but I'm not taking many.
[00:09:51.499 --> 00:09:54.541]  So just understand that some shows we take nothing but calls, some shows we
[00:09:55.211 --> 00:09:56.811]  Don't take many, and today is one of those.
[00:09:56.831 --> 00:09:59.392]  So I don't know when we're going to get to you, but we will get to you.
[00:09:59.412 --> 00:10:03.712]  Because I've got a lot of news I want to cover while these two guests are on with us as well.
[00:10:03.732 --> 00:10:06.753]  So John in Florida, and Moe in Oregon, and Paul in Montana.
[00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:09.073]  We'll get to you, but just be prepared to wait.
[00:10:09.854 --> 00:10:10.174]  Okay?
[00:10:12.234 --> 00:10:15.335]  Let me just give you the stacks of news I have here in front of me.
[00:10:16.335 --> 00:10:19.755]  China has been caught cloaking soldiers as monks to incite riots.
[00:10:20.795 --> 00:10:22.496]  British government is now saying that's even the case.
[00:10:22.516 --> 00:10:23.836]  We told you that about a week and a half ago.
[00:10:24.794 --> 00:10:29.176]  Also, airport security forces woman to remove nipple ring with pliers.
[00:10:30.537 --> 00:10:38.521]  And how that ties into other reports that we have, like cops beat peaceful Tibetan protesters in America.
[00:10:39.761 --> 00:10:43.964]  How this is all training for the police state, and how the elites are engaging in this training.
[00:10:44.524 --> 00:10:46.865]  Also, mobile phones more dangerous than smoking.
[00:10:47.285 --> 00:10:48.306]  Top government report.
[00:10:49.886 --> 00:10:53.028]  But people are going to continue their heavy use, radiating in their brains.
[00:10:53.755 --> 00:10:58.357]  Also, Mukasey says, the Attorney General, terrorists behind copyright violations.
[00:10:58.557 --> 00:11:04.800]  They're saying that copyright violation of any type now will be terrorism and you won't get a Bill of Rights or Constitution or due process.
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.821]  You can't make this stuff up.
[00:11:07.501 --> 00:11:10.903]  All misdemeanors under Section 802 of the Patriot Act are terrorism.
[00:11:13.124 --> 00:11:17.205]  10% of the college graduates going into Homeland Security isn't for real terrorism, folks.
[00:11:17.525 --> 00:11:18.626]  It's to run your life.
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:20.981]  Is to have secret police everywhere.
[00:11:21.041 --> 00:11:22.782]  It's the new America.
[00:11:23.283 --> 00:11:25.264]  So we'll be going over some of that as well.
[00:11:25.784 --> 00:11:28.006]  And then I've got this report, this group of reports.
[00:11:28.886 --> 00:11:31.908]  Under siege in Baghdad's Mahdi Army stronghold.
[00:11:33.629 --> 00:11:38.873]  Areas of Baghdad fall to militias as Iraq Army falters in Basra.
[00:11:41.874 --> 00:11:47.018]  Iraqi police in Basra shed their uniforms, kept their rifles, and switched sides.
[00:11:47.867 --> 00:11:50.489]  I was listening to fake conservatives, because they're not real conservatives.
[00:11:50.569 --> 00:11:51.991]  They're neutralized real conservatives.
[00:11:52.291 --> 00:11:53.832]  So it's too late to the globalist agenda.
[00:11:54.353 --> 00:12:09.166]  I listened to some San Antonio radio and some national radio, and it was Al-Qaeda is attacking in Basra, and Al-Qaeda is attacking in Baghdad, and that Al-Qaeda, backed by Iran, is attacking the Green Zone.
[00:12:09.206 --> 00:12:13.430]  Now, I talk about this every week, and it's finally getting some attention.
[00:12:16.872 --> 00:12:18.093]  Iran is Shiite.
[00:12:19.454 --> 00:12:24.418]  It is predominantly Shiites attacking the minority-run Sunni government.
[00:12:25.018 --> 00:12:27.220]  Sunni is the group that Al-Qaeda comes from.
[00:12:31.283 --> 00:12:37.267]  So when you listen to the news, and you listen to McCain, and I'm not saying vote for the Democrats either, the point is they're all a pack of criminals.
[00:12:38.428 --> 00:12:42.031]  They talk to you like you're two-year-old fools.
[00:12:43.072 --> 00:12:43.472]  So just
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.921]  Find out where Iraq is on a map.
[00:12:45.961 --> 00:12:47.362]  Get a globe out, or get a map out.
[00:12:47.862 --> 00:12:49.423]  Learn about the different branches of Islam.
[00:12:49.763 --> 00:12:51.144]  Learn about how they're at each other's throats.
[00:12:51.204 --> 00:12:54.666]  And then, watch the news and realize that they lie to you.
[00:12:55.887 --> 00:12:56.247]  Okay?
[00:12:56.587 --> 00:12:57.728]  Now, why did all this start?
[00:12:57.768 --> 00:12:59.449]  They were about to have fair elections again.
[00:12:59.849 --> 00:13:01.851]  It clearly showed that the Shiites were going to win.
[00:13:02.651 --> 00:13:03.672]  They can't have that.
[00:13:05.193 --> 00:13:12.517]  And so, the Sunni started invading strongholds, and they broke the ceasefire that had... Not the surge, isn't what worked.
[00:13:13.888 --> 00:13:21.770]  The ceasefire a year and a half ago, and by working, it did cut back about 50% the violence against Iraqis and the troops on both sides.
[00:13:23.571 --> 00:13:24.551]  I say all three sides.
[00:13:24.571 --> 00:13:29.112]  The Iraqi government, puppet troops, our troops, and then the Shiites.
[00:13:31.093 --> 00:13:35.894]  So, there was a ceasefire with al-Sadr, and that's admitted.
[00:13:35.934 --> 00:13:41.356]  A week ago, they rolled in there, started trying to get him, started trying to get others, started trying to take over Basra.
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:52.526]  For no reason, and now all hell has broken loose, that way you can't have a real election, and that way the people can't actually have their will.
[00:13:55.327 --> 00:13:57.388]  And now they've got an excuse to keep our troops there even longer.
[00:13:58.149 --> 00:13:59.450]  It's called the strategy of tension.
[00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:11.897]  When people get, you know, first they say we're going to Iraq for six weeks, then they say six months, then they say mission accomplished, then they say, oh, well, we've got to stop the violence, then they make deals and cut back on the violence, which is still just epidemic.
[00:14:13.035 --> 00:14:17.757]  Call it having one leg sawed off, and then they saw off the other, and then they tourniquet one and say, well, you're OK.
[00:14:18.057 --> 00:14:20.098]  Both legs are sawed off, but a tourniquet's on one.
[00:14:21.019 --> 00:14:24.381]  And then now they're going to say, oh, we've got to stay forever, because now the violence has started again.
[00:14:25.261 --> 00:14:37.687]  When you read the Pentagon plans and Israeli plans from more than a decade ago, they said split it in three parts, have the groups fight each other, and then set up military bases to project power into Iran, and then, of course, into Syria and surrounding areas.
[00:14:39.628 --> 00:14:41.209]  So, that's the basics there.
[00:14:41.749 --> 00:14:45.151]  And now, these vaunted brigades of troops trained by the U.S.
[00:14:45.191 --> 00:14:53.435]  and England are ordered to go in and attack their fellow Shiites and their fellow Iraqis, and they're laying their guns down.
[00:14:53.995 --> 00:14:57.197]  And I saw a London Guardian article calling them turncoats.
[00:14:59.618 --> 00:15:01.059]  No, they're not turncoats.
[00:15:01.099 --> 00:15:03.520]  They're with their people, with their religion.
[00:15:04.418 --> 00:15:06.099]  Would you expect Americans to do anything else?
[00:15:06.599 --> 00:15:12.641]  Again, the people running our government knowingly attacked them to get them to fight back because they don't want peace in the country.
[00:15:12.841 --> 00:15:13.581]  They want turmoil.
[00:15:13.621 --> 00:15:14.381]  That's the strategy.
[00:15:15.942 --> 00:15:17.603]  Now, the really big news when we get back.
[00:15:19.403 --> 00:15:21.704]  This is not Alex Jones, though I've talked a lot about this.
[00:15:21.744 --> 00:15:24.625]  I'm very thankful to see this in the New York Times.
[00:15:26.065 --> 00:15:29.226]  Asking the judge to save the world or more.
[00:15:30.627 --> 00:15:32.648]  When we get back, antimatter weapons.
[00:15:33.208 --> 00:15:33.608]  Stay with us.
[00:15:53.984 --> 00:15:55.384]  It is a big idea.
[00:15:55.404 --> 00:15:57.505]  A new world order.
[00:15:58.205 --> 00:16:02.227]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:16:02.247 --> 00:16:05.908]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:16:05.948 --> 00:16:08.109]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:16:08.715 --> 00:16:11.140]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:16:11.902 --> 00:16:19.217]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:16:22.254 --> 00:16:27.216]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:16:27.696 --> 00:16:31.497]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:16:31.577 --> 00:16:34.118]  Bill Burgess is making great progress for the world government.
[00:16:34.138 --> 00:16:35.278]  Most people have no idea.
[00:16:35.298 --> 00:16:36.039]  They're not after money.
[00:16:36.079 --> 00:16:37.139]  They have all the money they need.
[00:16:37.359 --> 00:16:38.059]  They're after power.
[00:16:38.359 --> 00:16:39.160]  That's what they're after.

[00:16:48.205 --> 00:16:48.565]  Endgame.
[00:16:48.946 --> 00:16:50.447]  Blueprint for Global and Slate.
[00:16:51.008 --> 00:16:52.169]  You have been warned.
[00:16:52.669 --> 00:16:53.670]  Ted Anderson for Midas.
[00:16:53.711 --> 00:16:53.951]  March 26, 2008.
[00:16:54.011 --> 00:16:54.151]  Gold 940, 270.
[00:16:54.251 --> 00:16:57.194]  Else gold coins can be purchased for 969.71, 477.55 for half, 238.78 for quarter.
[00:16:57.254 --> 00:16:57.654]  That's 969.71, 477.55, and 238.78.
[00:17:08.385 --> 00:17:10.946]  Edgy funds caught in the malaise of mortgage bankruptcies.
[00:17:10.986 --> 00:17:12.747]  The bond market continues to slump.
[00:17:12.927 --> 00:17:16.168]  JP Morgan gets caught in a $10 billion bad deal for Chrysler.
[00:17:16.188 --> 00:17:18.369]  Housing sales fell 6.6%.
[00:17:18.429 --> 00:17:23.210]  Mortgage giant Countrywide showed mortgage payment woes spreading to the middle and upper class.
[00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:25.651]  Investors cast doubt on investment banks.
[00:17:25.771 --> 00:17:30.053]  Credit protection insurance for mortgage lenders are skyrocketing due to the increased risk.
[00:17:30.433 --> 00:17:30.813]  The U.S.
[00:17:30.853 --> 00:17:35.137]  dollar is free-falling against foreign currencies and countries that previously financed the U.S.
[00:17:35.237 --> 00:17:36.958]  are now seeking safer alternatives.
[00:17:37.398 --> 00:17:40.120]  Economist Rody Boyd published the report, Bubble Leaking.
[00:17:40.361 --> 00:17:41.702]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[00:17:43.103 --> 00:17:47.126]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[00:17:47.206 --> 00:17:47.466]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:17:47.526 --> 00:17:47.806]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:17:47.826 --> 00:17:48.067]  Bill!
[00:17:54.705 --> 00:17:55.165]  Hi, neighbor.
[00:17:55.485 --> 00:17:58.206]  They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[00:17:58.786 --> 00:18:03.508]  Certainly we'd never intend to procrastinate getting our own food supply until there was none left at any price.
[00:18:04.068 --> 00:18:09.210]  We would intend to have plenty of food so the relief organizations could care for those unable to care for themselves.
[00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:16.892]  We would intend not to be standing in the breadline with the ignorant and the foolish who pretend the facts of food disappearance are untrue.
[00:18:17.412 --> 00:18:22.294]  If the experience of the Katrina disaster is evidence, the breadline may have no bread.
[00:18:22.934 --> 00:18:29.978]  Just like the good intentions on the road to that unheavenly place, the good intentions alone to get a supply of food will not feed us.
[00:18:30.758 --> 00:18:35.180]  Only getting our food supply immediately will make us independent and fearless for the future.
[00:18:35.861 --> 00:18:36.161]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:18:36.181 --> 00:18:36.221]  800-409-5633.
[00:18:36.241 --> 00:18:37.181]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[00:18:37.201 --> 00:18:37.521]  Who am I?
[00:18:37.541 --> 00:18:37.702]  Nobody.
[00:18:37.742 --> 00:18:38.842]  Steve Schenck, someone who cares.
[00:18:55.447 --> 00:18:59.470]  We all know that the Berkey water systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.
[00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:16.622]  The revolutionary Berkey Light self-sterilizing and recleanable purification elements purify water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels, and by extracting harmful chemicals such as herbicides, pesticides, VOCs, organic solvents, radon-222, and trihalomethanes.
[00:19:16.762 --> 00:19:21.185]  They also reduce nitrates, nitrates, sediment, and unhealthy minerals such as lead and mercury.
[00:19:21.385 --> 00:19:28.533]  As an authorized dealer for over two and a half years, serving thousands of satisfied customers, we offer amazing specials for Berkey Light water systems.

[00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:48.350]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:49.271]  Home to hard-hitting talk radio.
[00:20:07.859 --> 00:20:09.320]  All right, my friends, we're back live here.
[00:20:12.983 --> 00:20:27.493]  I remember in college, and I remember watching PBS and reading a few books by quantum mechanics and physicists about the danger of superconducting super colliders.
[00:20:31.176 --> 00:20:32.337]  And there's a lot of other
[00:20:34.474 --> 00:20:48.204]  Different devices and systems, and they've had machines for 40 years that take the amount of power that Cincinnati, was one example, uses in a week to change elements.
[00:20:48.264 --> 00:20:53.088]  They can change different metals into gold, or they can create totally new elements.
[00:20:53.108 --> 00:20:55.349]  They've created a bunch of them.
[00:20:55.389 --> 00:20:56.210]  That's one example.
[00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:58.452]  I mean, this science fiction stuff's been around 40 years.
[00:20:59.032 --> 00:21:02.795]  They were going to build a superconducting supercollider from Waxahachie down to Austin, Texas.
[00:21:03.675 --> 00:21:08.379]  And I remember at the time, reading about it when it stalled in the mid-1990s.
[00:21:08.479 --> 00:21:09.240]  Actually, when Bush Sr.
[00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:10.721]  left office in 1993, he killed it.
[00:21:12.502 --> 00:21:16.265]  They built a large part of it, a huge underground labyrinth up at Waxahachie.
[00:21:18.347 --> 00:21:19.448]  They built about a third of it.
[00:21:21.009 --> 00:21:33.239]  And they shoot different particles of lead and uranium and plutonium and gold and other heavy elements
[00:21:33.826 --> 00:21:38.069]  At the speed of light into other elements, or they accelerate them towards each other.
[00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:40.731]  And these things cost hundreds of billions of dollars to build.
[00:21:40.971 --> 00:21:42.572]  The European Union built the biggest one.
[00:21:42.933 --> 00:21:44.814]  They've got a whole bunch of them here in the US.
[00:21:46.115 --> 00:21:48.817]  And I'm going to get a bunch of top scientists and physicists on about this.
[00:21:48.897 --> 00:21:52.079]  Every time I mention this, people email me and say, man, you're nuts.
[00:21:52.199 --> 00:21:54.081]  This is UFO stuff.
[00:21:54.121 --> 00:21:56.662]  Look, I don't cover stuff that isn't documented.
[00:21:57.643 --> 00:22:00.085]  And all I know is the head of the British
[00:22:00.774 --> 00:22:08.781]  Royal Society, the most prestigious in the world, who's a physicist, wrote a book 20 years ago saying this could easily destroy the planet or the solar system.
[00:22:09.441 --> 00:22:23.373]  There's a bunch of physicists that are now suing to block this new collider that the equations show that there is a possibility of basically antimatter explosions, is the simplest way to put it.
[00:22:24.594 --> 00:22:28.617]  But I thought instead of... I mean, sometime this week, someday on the weekday show or
[00:22:29.727 --> 00:22:30.748]  Maybe even tomorrow.
[00:22:31.789 --> 00:22:37.433]  In fact, Trey, my producer in there yesterday, I dug up one of these physicists who's suing.
[00:22:37.853 --> 00:22:38.734]  Number in Hawaii.
[00:22:39.214 --> 00:22:39.814]  I sent that to you.
[00:22:39.834 --> 00:22:40.995]  I want to get him on in the next few days.
[00:22:41.015 --> 00:22:42.256]  We're going to have a bunch of them on.
[00:22:43.257 --> 00:22:44.198]  And these are not quacks.
[00:22:44.218 --> 00:22:45.499]  These are highly respected physicists.
[00:22:46.359 --> 00:22:50.222]  And they're saying that the equations are showing all sorts of problems.
[00:22:50.983 --> 00:22:53.725]  Now, they're talking about it creating black holes.
[00:22:54.845 --> 00:22:58.128]  And these same physicists, and it's a large group of them, have been saying this for
[00:22:58.564 --> 00:23:08.789]  In the equations for 40 years, complaining for 20, lawsuits for, well, since 1990, different groups have been filing suits, so that's 18 years.
[00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:17.834]  And they said, theoretically, this shows that there's a probability, if they do thousands of tests, that you will get black holes.
[00:23:17.934 --> 00:23:19.455]  Well, now they got black holes.
[00:23:20.751 --> 00:23:23.232]  And the New York Times obviously didn't do its research on this.
[00:23:23.252 --> 00:23:26.934]  I mean, they say it's a real threat, but they say, oh, that's not going to make a black hole.
[00:23:27.414 --> 00:23:30.035]  They have the head of one of these colliders saying that's kooky.
[00:23:30.395 --> 00:23:36.317]  Well, funny, already in similar colliders, National Geographic, black hole.
[00:23:36.878 --> 00:23:41.900]  A Brown University physicist has created a black hole in a particle accelerator.
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.661]  That's National Geographic.
[00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:47.560]  That was March 18, 2005.
[00:23:49.041 --> 00:23:49.901]  Here's Fox News.
[00:23:50.261 --> 00:23:52.462]  Scientists create artificial black hole in lab.
[00:23:53.502 --> 00:23:59.703]  Exactly what these physicists warned everybody about 20 years ago is what they're now doing.
[00:24:00.584 --> 00:24:04.465]  Now, I've got LA Times here.
[00:24:04.705 --> 00:24:06.205]  Here's a San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:24:07.325 --> 00:24:09.566]  Air Force pursuing antimatter weapons.
[00:24:10.316 --> 00:24:19.319]  The program was touted publicly, then official gag order came, and it goes into this long article admitting that the Air Force, seven years ago, admitted they had already created antimatter weapons.
[00:24:20.119 --> 00:24:32.464]  Isolated them in these particle accelerators, then they've got to hold them in these huge facilities with these different magnetic fields that take the power of a city, literally, just to hold it.
[00:24:32.504 --> 00:24:35.665]  And then they go, but don't worry, they decay before they explode.
[00:24:35.945 --> 00:24:38.366]  And then, oh, don't worry, physicist Hawking's
[00:24:39.305 --> 00:24:44.532]  Uh, Hawking, he said that it would make black holes, but that they would decay and break down.
[00:24:45.873 --> 00:24:48.957]  But he said that after these were developed.
[00:24:49.277 --> 00:24:57.027]  The physicists that predicted they would make black holes, even by accident, in these superconducting super colliders, predicted it, and they laughed at it, and then they made them!
[00:24:58.689 --> 00:25:03.192]  Now, the problem is that they say, well, we're holding these black holes in these fields.
[00:25:03.873 --> 00:25:09.157]  And so they're unable to get more matter to energize themselves and grow, and so they decay and break up.
[00:25:10.158 --> 00:25:17.523]  You see, if a black hole is able to start grabbing other particles around it, its core gets smaller and denser.
[00:25:19.065 --> 00:25:21.126]  But don't worry, if this happens, you won't feel anything.
[00:25:21.867 --> 00:25:27.511]  You will be crushed into subatomic quarks, and that's little subdivisions of atoms.
[00:25:27.901 --> 00:25:31.663]  And sucked into something smaller than a pinhead instantly.
[00:25:32.043 --> 00:25:40.527]  You will feel no pain, no nothing, just all the birds, all the bees, your boathouse, your home, pictures of grandma, it's all gone.
[00:25:40.687 --> 00:25:42.407]  The whole planet, everything gone.
[00:25:42.627 --> 00:25:45.369]  Solar system pulled in, sun pulled in, everything gone.
[00:25:46.909 --> 00:25:51.772]  But that's only one of the hundreds of things that physicists have predicted that these would be able to create.
[00:25:51.872 --> 00:25:52.772]  Now they're creating them!
[00:25:55.319 --> 00:25:58.840]  But don't worry, you're worried about taking some farmer's ranch, the name of environmentalism.
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:03.481]  Or you're worried for some corrupt developer who runs the local environmental front group.
[00:26:03.961 --> 00:26:09.582]  Or you're worried about the ozone gases, the carbon dioxide that plants breathe that humans exhale.
[00:26:09.722 --> 00:26:10.863]  We've got to tax that.
[00:26:11.963 --> 00:26:14.704]  Or, all these petty issues.
[00:26:14.824 --> 00:26:24.226]  You're not worried about the genetic engineering, the thousands of labs randomly cross-spicing different species, huge megaviruses that have already gotten out, all sorts of serious problems.
[00:26:24.827 --> 00:26:26.207]  I've had double prize winners on about this.
[00:26:26.347 --> 00:26:27.548]  I'm not giving you my opinion.
[00:26:27.708 --> 00:26:28.548]  This is already happening.
[00:26:30.788 --> 00:26:34.309]  You like 1 in 33 having cancer, now it's 1 in 3 about to be 1 in 2.
[00:26:34.589 --> 00:26:36.710]  You like everybody having diabetes, all the stuff that's happening.
[00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:37.850]  You like GMO food.
[00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:40.510]  You like the fact that these GMO foods kill all the rats that eat it.
[00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:42.011]  They still certify it and feed it to us.
[00:26:42.571 --> 00:26:44.611]  We're a lot tougher than a rat, folks, but it's messing us up.
[00:26:45.991 --> 00:26:48.352]  You like what sodium fluoride does to your kidneys and your brain?
[00:26:49.568 --> 00:26:52.189]  My point is, the elites are out of their mind.
[00:26:52.209 --> 00:26:53.429]  They've got to have this power.
[00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:57.331]  They've got to be the ones that, well, whoever discovers it will have total control.
[00:26:57.811 --> 00:27:02.113]  And whoever has the antimatter weapons, whoever has the free energy, we, you know, we have to do this.
[00:27:03.473 --> 00:27:13.637]  I don't know if Atlantis existed, but the, you know, the legend is, is they created an energy system and were playing with this type of stuff and it totally blew the continent to pieces in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
[00:27:14.386 --> 00:27:15.588]  I don't believe in stuff like that.
[00:27:15.828 --> 00:27:16.769]  Who knows if that was true?
[00:27:16.969 --> 00:27:28.703]  The point is, we're coming up to some type of Atlantean disaster here, with the genetic engineering, with what they're doing in superconducting super colliders.
[00:27:29.624 --> 00:27:31.807]  And that's only one class of these laboratories.
[00:27:31.827 --> 00:27:33.429]  There's literally hundreds of these things.
[00:27:35.683 --> 00:27:37.866]  Air Force pursuing antimatter weapons.
[00:27:38.427 --> 00:27:40.610]  Program was touted publicly, then came official gag order.
[00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:44.295]  But before I get into that, let me just read you the New York Times from Friday.
[00:27:45.577 --> 00:27:47.880]  Asking a judge to save the world or more.
[00:27:49.397 --> 00:27:56.480]  More fighting in Iraq, Somalian chaos, people in this country can't afford their mortgages, and in some places now, they can't even afford rice.
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:06.985]  None of this, nor the rest of the grimness on the front page today, will matter a bit, though, if the two men pursuing a lawsuit in federal court in Hawaii turn out to be right.
[00:28:07.045 --> 00:28:15.889]  They think a giant particle accelerator that will begin smashing protons together outside Geneva this summer might produce a black hole or something else that will spell the end of Earth, and maybe the universe.
[00:28:17.093 --> 00:28:20.475]  And it goes on to say that a lot of top scientists agree with him.
[00:28:21.615 --> 00:28:22.536]  We'll finish up with this.
[00:28:22.596 --> 00:28:23.636]  Go to Jim Mars.
[00:28:24.317 --> 00:28:26.958]  He's now basically admitted the government killed RFK.
[00:28:27.559 --> 00:28:33.362]  Then we've got a high-level member of the Japanese Parliament coming on to talk about 9-11 being an inside job.
[00:28:33.382 --> 00:28:33.802]  Stay with us.
[00:28:53.712 --> 00:28:55.393]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:28:55.713 --> 00:28:59.135]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:28:59.315 --> 00:29:01.176]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:29:01.797 --> 00:29:04.558]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:29:04.858 --> 00:29:10.361]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:29:10.642 --> 00:29:14.564]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:29:14.904 --> 00:29:19.845]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[00:29:20.125 --> 00:29:22.906]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[00:30:53.294 --> 00:31:03.877]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[00:31:04.177 --> 00:31:08.099]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[00:31:08.359 --> 00:31:10.159]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[00:31:10.519 --> 00:31:15.961]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[00:31:16.141 --> 00:31:25.906]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[00:31:26.166 --> 00:31:32.409]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:35.991]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[00:31:36.011 --> 00:31:37.832]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[00:31:38.072 --> 00:31:41.174]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[00:31:41.494 --> 00:31:44.757]  Here are just a few of the benefits associated with heart and body extract.
[00:31:44.957 --> 00:31:48.020]  Blood sugar, cholesterol, and circulation levels return to normal.
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:49.381]  Arteries unclog.
[00:31:49.641 --> 00:31:51.423]  Angina is gone in just a few days.
[00:31:51.443 --> 00:31:53.104]  Blood pressure goes back to normal.
[00:31:53.284 --> 00:31:55.626]  An irregular heartbeat returns to normal.
[00:31:55.947 --> 00:32:00.691]  Heart and body extract works by making sure your body is in balance naturally without
[00:32:00.891 --> 00:32:02.693]  Absolutely no negative side effects.
[00:32:02.973 --> 00:32:07.016]  Doctors who've tried heart and body extract with their patients are thrilled with the results.
[00:32:07.296 --> 00:32:12.441]  Dr. Mark Goodman talks about his experience with a patient of his who started taking heart and body extract.
[00:32:18.806 --> 00:32:23.751]  He could not walk from his house to the mailbox to get his mail because he had congestive heart failure.
[00:32:23.911 --> 00:32:29.316]  And after being on this product for about four to six weeks, he was able to walk 50 minutes per day.
[00:32:29.476 --> 00:32:32.139]  And after two months, he was walking up to three miles per day.
[00:32:32.299 --> 00:32:34.421]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.
[00:32:34.781 --> 00:32:35.681]  You are listening to GCN!
[00:32:35.721 --> 00:32:36.862]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[00:33:10.128 --> 00:33:11.028]  Alright, we're back live.
[00:33:11.048 --> 00:33:18.392]  We're about to go to a man who is recognized as the world expert on the JFK and RFK assassinations.
[00:33:18.412 --> 00:33:23.574]  He was the first person to teach an accredited college course in the assassination.
[00:33:23.614 --> 00:33:24.115]  Of course, he was
[00:33:25.123 --> 00:33:38.955]  Working Dallas and Fort Worth as a crime reporter that he even danced on the bar at Jack Ruby's bar in the weeks before The JFK assassination in Dallas 43 years ago, but Bobby's in the news now That's coming up in just a few minutes.
[00:33:39.455 --> 00:33:47.783]  Yeah later this week on the weekday show or maybe even next Sunday I'm gonna do like two hours on advanced technologies on the types of
[00:33:48.885 --> 00:33:59.270]  Things that the superconducting super colliders, that the quantum mechanics, that the engineers, the physicists are doing there.
[00:34:00.791 --> 00:34:11.876]  And a lot of, I mean, the head physicist, the guy who previously headed up the Royal Society in England, said 20 years ago he thought it could create black holes.
[00:34:12.932 --> 00:34:19.476]  And that's why other physicists checked into it and said, my God, we think they're going to create black holes in these colliders.
[00:34:19.496 --> 00:34:25.078]  There's a good chance that if they do thousands of experiments with these heavy particles that this will happen.
[00:34:26.059 --> 00:34:27.640]  And there's a bunch of other things they can create.
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:29.441]  And now they've been doing that.
[00:34:30.402 --> 00:34:33.983]  And you understand, if a black hole gets going, it'll just suck the whole planet into it, everything.
[00:34:34.483 --> 00:34:36.843]  Down to something much smaller than the head of a pen.
[00:34:37.363 --> 00:34:43.745]  And if you want to laugh at these equations, Planck and others in 1910, Einstein just picked it up and codified it.
[00:34:44.125 --> 00:34:52.707]  German physicists came up with the plans and said, our mathematics show that if you do this with uranium or plutonium, that you'll have this happen.
[00:34:53.027 --> 00:34:57.728]  And they were able to predict the yields exactly 30 years before it happened in 1944.
[00:34:59.764 --> 00:35:00.384]  And they dropped it in 45.
[00:35:01.705 --> 00:35:03.386]  That's 60 plus years ago.
[00:35:03.646 --> 00:35:04.726]  Almost 70 years ago.
[00:35:05.446 --> 00:35:07.908]  And then the Air Force admits they've made antimatter weapons.
[00:35:08.988 --> 00:35:11.429]  They admit that they've isolated antimatter in these chambers.
[00:35:15.291 --> 00:35:19.192]  And then the New York Times comes out and says, well, it is a problem.
[00:35:19.913 --> 00:35:22.154]  But then they talk to the head of the European Collider.
[00:35:23.354 --> 00:35:24.415]  They call it the Heavy Reactor.
[00:35:28.297 --> 00:35:29.698]  We only have Jim for about 25 minutes.
[00:35:29.718 --> 00:35:30.718]  I better shut up.
[00:35:31.018 --> 00:35:32.238]  How do you get into a subject like this?
[00:35:32.258 --> 00:35:35.520]  This is the type of thing, while my kids are playing in the backyard, I'm thinking about this.
[00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:38.741]  And I'm thinking about all the other serious issues.
[00:35:38.801 --> 00:35:39.381]  Why wouldn't you?
[00:35:39.501 --> 00:35:41.242]  It's not like I'm special or intellectual.
[00:35:41.542 --> 00:35:43.242]  You find out about this, you get concerned.
[00:35:44.663 --> 00:35:47.844]  And you find out all these other top scientists are all concerned.
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:53.766]  And the governments, though, all are in races with each other, and they're randomly splicing genetics.
[00:35:54.026 --> 00:35:57.690]  They're randomly colliding heavy particles in superconducting supercolliders.
[00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:00.092]  They're randomly, just to see what'll happen!
[00:36:04.677 --> 00:36:08.662]  Meanwhile, the public's watching Britney Spears getting her Botox.
[00:36:10.632 --> 00:36:11.312]  I don't know what to do.
[00:36:11.352 --> 00:36:14.914]  You know, I know Jim's actually written about subjects like this, but we're about to get into Bobby here briefly.
[00:36:15.775 --> 00:36:26.481]  Jim, I know you've been concerned about these superconducting supercolliders, but I've talked to people with degrees, even people who, you know, have got science degrees, and they're not even aware of this, Jim.
[00:36:27.221 --> 00:36:38.407]  Well, what we all need to keep in mind is that back when they tested the first atomic bomb at the Trinity site in New Mexico, this is in the spring of 1945,
[00:36:41.016 --> 00:36:59.348]  Fully half or more of the scientists working on the Manhattan Project sincerely believed that once they set off a nuclear chain reaction, they would not be able to stop it, and it would eventually catch the atmosphere on fire and would incinerate the entire planet.
[00:36:59.868 --> 00:37:01.209]  But they set it off anyway!
[00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:04.091]  Luckily, they were wrong about that one.
[00:37:04.591 --> 00:37:06.012]  But you're absolutely right, Alex.
[00:37:06.884 --> 00:37:13.909]  There's no question in my mind that right now, even as we speak and even as your listeners are listening, there are deep, secret
[00:37:15.973 --> 00:37:24.417]  Government laboratories where they are tinkering with the basic energy building blocks of the universe.
[00:37:24.737 --> 00:37:25.498]  Now let's be clear.
[00:37:25.958 --> 00:37:34.002]  In public labs they're doing things that their own equations say have a good chance of blowing the whole solar system to kingdom come.
[00:37:34.042 --> 00:37:35.202]  But blowing is the wrong word.
[00:37:35.242 --> 00:37:37.003]  It won't be expanding, it'll be contracting.
[00:37:37.684 --> 00:37:38.944]  And that's just one of the threats.
[00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:42.551]  I mean, what is wrong with these people?
[00:37:42.591 --> 00:37:57.883]  In fact, they've got that famous documentary from Discovery Channel, The Trinity, where it showed the secret test for the first time, where they detonated in one night, like a hundred high-powered hydrogen bombs in the atmosphere, to see if it would set the Earth's atmosphere on fire.
[00:37:58.643 --> 00:38:04.147]  I mean, and that's on mainstream television, at one night, hundreds of nukes going off in the atmosphere.
[00:38:04.948 --> 00:38:08.671]  And now we're wondering why there's a hole in the ozone layer.
[00:38:10.026 --> 00:38:12.327]  These people, I mean, what is wrong with the New World Order?
[00:38:13.128 --> 00:38:24.374]  One reason that they have been dismissing global warming for so long, because once you really look at it, you figure out that it was the above-ground atomic testing that blew the holes in the atmosphere.
[00:38:25.226 --> 00:38:26.387]  There's major studies on that.
[00:38:26.447 --> 00:38:28.467]  I tell you, there's not a subject Jim isn't an expert on.
[00:38:28.668 --> 00:38:30.348]  We only have about 20 minutes, Jim.
[00:38:30.628 --> 00:38:43.594]  Let's quickly get into the two separate articles that have broken two separate camps, the BBC, three-year investigation, Newsnight, their most prestigious program, basically their nightly news, saying that
[00:38:45.387 --> 00:38:53.232]  Four CIA high-level operatives from Southeast Asia photographed, filmed around Bobby at the time, something you've always said.
[00:38:53.672 --> 00:38:58.935]  And then separately, we always knew that the coroner had talked about him being shot in the back, not in the front.
[00:38:59.256 --> 00:39:06.580]  And now we have the head of the National Forensic Society and a whole bunch of other top scientists saying, yes, he was shot from the back, not from the front.
[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:09.502]  Boil it down for folks, the two separate camps.
[00:39:09.542 --> 00:39:11.003]  Then let's go into detail on both sides.
[00:39:11.536 --> 00:39:14.957]  Well, of course, this is actually nothing new.
[00:39:16.097 --> 00:39:31.940]  Me and many other people, almost since the time of the Robert Kennedy assassination, have loudly tried to shout out that he was not killed by Sirhan Sirhan, who cannot remember anything that happened since he was probably brainwashed.
[00:39:33.281 --> 00:39:40.082]  But what is happening is, and what makes these stories significant, is that after all these years and after all the
[00:39:41.114 --> 00:39:44.497]  Further evidence, including scientific evidence, comes out.
[00:39:45.238 --> 00:40:01.911]  More and more people are waking up and beginning to realize that the so-called conspiracy theorists were actually right all along, just as we were in the Kennedy assassination, just as we were in the Martin Luther King assassination, just as we were in the... Gulf of Tonkin!
[00:40:02.191 --> 00:40:09.757]  ...Waco, the bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City,
[00:40:10.608 --> 00:40:21.213]  You know, they're finally beginning to kind of wake up, and it's almost too late, because I know you, like I do, keep up with the economic news, and it does not look good at all.
[00:40:22.934 --> 00:40:33.519]  Basically, we're a nation that's broke, because according to the government's own statistics, the total government obligations total more than $53 trillion.
[00:40:36.602 --> 00:40:39.643]  And compare that against the net worth of all U.S.
[00:40:39.683 --> 00:40:45.205]  households, which is estimated as just slightly above $40 trillion.
[00:40:45.245 --> 00:40:47.506]  So we owe more money than we could possibly ever...
[00:40:53.028 --> 00:40:55.532]  Economists call it a financial black hole.
[00:40:55.892 --> 00:41:01.980]  Its mass is so much greater than all real assets, it cannot be escaped, and the bankers will have a consolidation.
[00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:09.590]  The Federal Reserve in 93 and then in 99 publicly changed the rules to allow the criminal lending we have just witnessed that popped
[00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:11.011]  That's exactly correct.
[00:41:11.031 --> 00:41:12.471]  In fact, if you go back and check out the
[00:41:38.982 --> 00:41:40.022]  We're good to go.
[00:42:00.276 --> 00:42:01.337]  We're good to go.
[00:42:20.379 --> 00:42:26.502]  And now we gave the private bankers total control over the fiat currency, and they're going to completely rape us.
[00:42:27.083 --> 00:42:35.407]  Jim, though, I want to, in the last segment we've got with you, I want us, I know you've written books on it, covered it nauseam, it's old news for you, but it's all over the news now.
[00:42:35.808 --> 00:42:39.750]  Walk through exactly how they killed Bobby in the back.
[00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:43.351]  Now they've even isolated that it was his gun that did it.
[00:42:44.372 --> 00:42:50.935]  This is mainstream news, but I want to go over how they engineered that and a lot more with our guest on the other side, Jim Mars on Alex Jones.
[00:42:53.811 --> 00:42:56.332]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:42:56.672 --> 00:42:57.952]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[00:42:58.232 --> 00:43:00.233]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:43:00.393 --> 00:43:02.134]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:43:02.294 --> 00:43:03.514]  The late, great USA.
[00:43:03.774 --> 00:43:05.195]  America, freedom to fascism.
[00:43:05.535 --> 00:43:12.357]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[00:43:53.137 --> 00:43:59.501]  Hi neighbor, no matter when the time comes to survive on our food supply, every single one of us who have prepared will have two regrets.
[00:44:00.141 --> 00:44:05.924]  Even those who haven't wasted a single penny on Christmas, birthdays, and vacations in order to store all the food possible.
[00:44:06.645 --> 00:44:09.886]  Even those who have sold stuff and taken on part-time jobs to buy food.
[00:44:10.547 --> 00:44:13.769]  Even those who have traded their gold while it will still buy food.
[00:44:14.429 --> 00:44:17.811]  Yes, we will have been called stupid, crazy and foolish.
[00:44:18.411 --> 00:44:22.914]  When folks won't be able to afford food and there won't be any food for any amount of money.
[00:44:23.655 --> 00:44:25.616]  We will still have two regrets.
[00:44:26.276 --> 00:44:29.618]  We will regret that we didn't get more serious about more food sooner.
[00:44:30.298 --> 00:44:33.180]  We will deeply regret that we didn't get enough food.
[00:44:33.961 --> 00:44:40.785]  Putting off emergency food preparations to celebrate the holidays will be the most dangerous decision that some of us will ever make.
[00:44:41.565 --> 00:44:41.825]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:44:41.845 --> 00:44:42.946]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.

[00:44:43.106 --> 00:44:43.587]  It is a big idea.
[00:44:43.607 --> 00:44:44.447]  A new world order.
[00:44:44.888 --> 00:44:47.870]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:45:03.328 --> 00:45:05.470]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:45:06.130 --> 00:45:08.372]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:45:08.912 --> 00:45:11.354]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:45:12.094 --> 00:45:19.420]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:45:22.442 --> 00:45:27.407]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:45:27.908 --> 00:45:31.371]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:45:31.771 --> 00:45:34.314]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:45:34.354 --> 00:45:35.495]  Most people have no idea.
[00:45:35.515 --> 00:45:36.275]  They're not after money.
[00:45:36.295 --> 00:45:37.336]  They have all the money they need.
[00:45:37.577 --> 00:45:37.997]  They're after power.
[00:45:38.017 --> 00:45:39.378]  That's what they're after these days.

[00:45:51.188 --> 00:45:52.229]  You have been warned.
[00:45:53.348 --> 00:45:56.731]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:45:56.871 --> 00:46:02.076]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:46:02.256 --> 00:46:07.040]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:46:07.421 --> 00:46:18.551]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:46:18.931 --> 00:46:24.473]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[00:46:24.713 --> 00:46:30.776]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.

[00:47:10.768 --> 00:47:11.968]  Jim Mars is our guest.
[00:47:12.008 --> 00:47:16.730]  Jim Mars is consulting and, of course, in a JFK film I'm putting out.
[00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:20.311]  I think we're going to add a little bit about Bobby in there as well.
[00:47:20.351 --> 00:47:21.592]  That'll be out in about six, eight months.
[00:47:21.612 --> 00:47:25.113]  You've got a new book coming out, too.
[00:47:25.673 --> 00:47:27.113]  Are you ready to tell folks what it's about?
[00:47:27.194 --> 00:47:31.755]  Proving how the whole Nazi system was just transplanted over here, Jim?
[00:47:32.435 --> 00:47:40.258]  Well, that's pretty much the story, except, of course, that sounds pretty outrageous that, oh, wait a minute, we are now the Fourth Reich.
[00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:42.091]  I think so.
[00:47:53.976 --> 00:47:56.657]  Hitler's Third Reich was defeated in World War II.
[00:47:56.717 --> 00:48:01.520]  They simply brought thousands and thousands of Nazis and pro-Nazis.
[00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:05.482]  And that's because there was already a huge Nazi apparatus with the Rockefellers.
[00:48:05.882 --> 00:48:06.122]  Right.
[00:48:06.242 --> 00:48:10.585]  Over here, the owner, Thomas Watson of IBM.
[00:48:11.405 --> 00:48:12.045]  Bush Sr.
[00:48:12.085 --> 00:48:12.626]  was the head.
[00:48:12.946 --> 00:48:18.929]  Nazi backband of the big... Yeah, the names of prominent Americans who supported Hitler is
[00:48:19.429 --> 00:48:20.791]  It's pretty amazing.
[00:48:21.471 --> 00:48:23.513]  You've got Watson of IBM.
[00:48:23.533 --> 00:48:25.655]  You've got Henry Ford of Ford Motor Company.
[00:48:25.675 --> 00:48:28.338]  You've got Chase Bank and John J. McCloy.
[00:48:28.738 --> 00:48:33.362]  You've got the Dulles brothers, who are all representing the Rockefellers.
[00:48:33.442 --> 00:48:40.189]  Standard Oil, by the way, had tankers that were refueling German U-boats in the Caribbean
[00:48:41.269 --> 00:48:45.712]  In late 1944, almost towards the end of the war.
[00:48:46.473 --> 00:48:47.974]  It's always a deal.
[00:48:48.034 --> 00:48:49.795]  It's always a business deal.
[00:48:49.815 --> 00:48:52.516]  Well, they put Hitler in power and then set him up.
[00:48:53.257 --> 00:48:55.458]  I mean, as you know, but that's all mainstream history.
[00:48:55.518 --> 00:48:55.858]  I can't wait.
[00:48:55.878 --> 00:48:59.841]  I'm going to carry the book on the shopping cart to the bookstore at InfoWars.com.
[00:48:59.941 --> 00:49:01.082]  Okay, we've got about ten minutes left.
[00:49:01.482 --> 00:49:02.983]  Get into the Bobby situation.
[00:49:03.523 --> 00:49:05.965]  I mean, for people that don't know the basics of what really happened.
[00:49:06.145 --> 00:49:09.627]  Okay, what most people know is that Robert Kennedy
[00:49:10.737 --> 00:49:20.264]  On the very night in June of 1968, when he received the California nomination for president, that pretty well cinched him for the national Democratic nomination.
[00:49:20.284 --> 00:49:25.908]  In other words, he was going to be the presidential candidate in 1968.
[00:49:28.850 --> 00:49:38.296]  Just a few days before that, before his assassination, he was asked, you know, what can you do about the death of your brother, President John F. Kennedy?
[00:49:38.795 --> 00:49:38.895]  Yes.
[00:49:58.652 --> 00:50:09.558]  Kennedy assassination, but of course he never got a chance to do that because walking through the pantry, a back pantry of the Ambassador Hotel, shots were fired and he was fatally wounded.
[00:50:10.079 --> 00:50:11.400]  Okay, now we all know that.
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:18.023]  We all know that Sirhan Sirhan went to trial and is serving a life sentence for doing the shooting.
[00:50:18.584 --> 00:50:21.606]  Here's what you need to remember about the Robert Kennedy assassination.
[00:50:22.066 --> 00:50:27.269]  Number one, Sirhan Sirhan never got closer than three or four feet in front
[00:50:27.865 --> 00:50:41.149]  of Kennedy, and yet Thomas Noguchi, a world-class medical examiner, testified under oath in court that the shot that killed Robert Kennedy was fired right behind the right ear, at the right mastoid.
[00:50:41.169 --> 00:50:42.970]  There were four shots pumped into him.
[00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:45.811]  Yeah, one in the back and one in the head.
[00:50:47.852 --> 00:50:51.973]  So the thing to remember is that Noguchi said that the shot to his
[00:50:52.483 --> 00:50:57.465]  Right Mastoid, behind his right ear, was at no more than three inches away.
[00:50:58.045 --> 00:51:04.268]  So he was shot by someone standing right beside him.
[00:51:04.308 --> 00:51:08.690]  By the way, he was the big LA coroner, but they went after him, but then he got vindicated later.
[00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:19.374]  I mean, this is the coroner, medical examiner, saying he was shot in the back, and we have his little friend behind him, and now it's the same gun we know he owned that these acoustics experts have matched.
[00:51:19.394 --> 00:51:19.754]  But go ahead.
[00:51:20.074 --> 00:51:20.554]  That's right.
[00:51:20.674 --> 00:51:27.635]  So the actual killer of Robert Kennedy was a part-time security guard named Thayne Cesar.
[00:51:27.775 --> 00:51:30.176]  And his name has been bounced around for years.
[00:51:30.596 --> 00:51:36.357]  And if there's no truth to this, you'd think that Cesar or his family would have filed suit and made lots of money.
[00:51:36.657 --> 00:51:38.077]  But nobody said anything.
[00:51:38.457 --> 00:51:47.099]  And interestingly enough, his day job was working at a U-2 spy plane facility run by the CIA.
[00:51:48.126 --> 00:51:51.928]  So we see the footprints of CIA and of government.
[00:51:51.968 --> 00:51:55.429]  Funny, Lee Harvey Oswald worked at the U2 spy base.
[00:51:55.729 --> 00:51:56.349]  That's true.
[00:51:56.750 --> 00:52:05.213]  And Lee Harvey Oswald, by the way, and this has been totally confirmed, was being used operationally by the CIA prior to the assassination.
[00:52:05.413 --> 00:52:08.875]  Now that control number has now been declassified, but I'm interrupting here.
[00:52:09.395 --> 00:52:11.135]  We're not just saying this about Mr. Caesar.
[00:52:12.276 --> 00:52:17.038]  He's the guy standing right behind Kennedy when all of this happened, and now, this is ABC News,
[00:52:17.438 --> 00:52:18.759]  This is CBS, NBC.
[00:52:18.979 --> 00:52:20.060]  They're coming out and saying it.
[00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:32.967]  The top forensic experts in the country, the top... I mean, the guy that heads up the society, they have gone in with the audio and isolated it to 14 shots, explained that, and then they matched it to the gun that Caesar even had a license for.
[00:52:33.228 --> 00:52:33.708]  That's right.
[00:52:33.748 --> 00:52:42.753]  There were more shots fired than was possible for Sirhan's six-shot revolver to accommodate.
[00:52:43.294 --> 00:52:46.936]  Now, everything... This is the same thing that's going on and on.
[00:52:47.535 --> 00:52:59.192]  Uh, 40 years after the Kennedy assassination, we finally, anybody that cared to look, uh, could determine for themselves that he was killed as a result of a conspiracy to track right back to the federal government of the United States.
[00:52:59.645 --> 00:53:01.106]  Same thing now with Robert Kennedy.
[00:53:01.186 --> 00:53:04.727]  And he had just won, I mean, he had locked in the Democratic nomination.
[00:53:04.907 --> 00:53:05.968]  Right.
[00:53:06.168 --> 00:53:15.432]  But my point is, is that 40 years later, it's like, okay, we'll tell the truth now, or we'll allow the truth to come out, because who's going to do anything?
[00:53:15.832 --> 00:53:21.755]  And I say this because 9-11 is not that far back, and we are still embroiled in the effects of 9-11.
[00:53:22.215 --> 00:53:26.797]  Homeland Security, the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, and it was all based on lies.
[00:53:27.432 --> 00:53:33.538]  Right down the line, and as more information comes out, we're finding that 9-11 was indeed an inside job.
[00:53:33.558 --> 00:53:33.938]  Stop there.
[00:53:33.958 --> 00:53:38.622]  I want to get into that in closing, but let's go back for people to be clear, for police officers listening, for instance.
[00:53:39.303 --> 00:53:43.207]  It's mainstream news admitted the coroner, the police, and they were told to shut up about it.
[00:53:43.607 --> 00:53:49.172]  Fourteen bullet holes, they dug out two different calibers, and Sirhan had this six-shot gun.
[00:53:49.673 --> 00:53:49.893]  Right.
[00:53:50.444 --> 00:53:54.626]  And by the way, he was grabbed after the first shot and his arm pinned down.
[00:53:54.806 --> 00:53:55.347]  That's true.
[00:53:56.447 --> 00:54:03.471]  Rafer Johnson and some other big old football player, Rosie Greer, they all jumped on him.
[00:54:03.511 --> 00:54:07.493]  He may have gotten off one decent shot and the rest of the shots went wild.
[00:54:07.553 --> 00:54:10.815]  In fact, that's another thing to remember in the death of Robert Kennedy.
[00:54:11.255 --> 00:54:14.397]  There were bullet holes in door panels and in the ceiling tiles.
[00:54:14.718 --> 00:54:19.381]  These were all taken away by the Los Angeles Police Department and have now disappeared.
[00:54:19.801 --> 00:54:21.383]  They're not available to anybody.
[00:54:21.843 --> 00:54:22.203]  Okay?
[00:54:22.263 --> 00:54:25.365]  If that's not evidence of a cover-up, then I don't know what is.
[00:54:25.385 --> 00:54:26.867]  It's the same thing with Oklahoma City.
[00:54:27.127 --> 00:54:30.249]  They have Controlled Demolition Incorporated come in and blow up the rest of the building.
[00:54:30.569 --> 00:54:31.490]  Hide it under guard.
[00:54:31.550 --> 00:54:32.811]  Pour concrete in with the chunks.
[00:54:33.211 --> 00:54:34.412]  Same thing with JFK.
[00:54:34.432 --> 00:54:35.553]  Same thing with 9-11.
[00:54:35.833 --> 00:54:36.894]  Same thing with Waco.
[00:54:37.174 --> 00:54:38.315]  Covering up the evidence.
[00:54:39.091 --> 00:54:39.692]  Exactly.
[00:54:40.172 --> 00:54:45.736]  And they are now so arrogant about it that they don't even take too much pain and trouble to cover it up.
[00:54:46.096 --> 00:54:48.018]  They even blow up Building 7 in front of everybody.
[00:54:48.258 --> 00:54:48.838]  That's right.
[00:54:49.258 --> 00:54:51.660]  And then just said, well, there was a little fire in it somewhere.
[00:54:52.821 --> 00:55:04.069]  But now we have just everybody, all these physicists, all these scientists, Italian presidents, CIA section chiefs, Willie Nelson.
[00:55:05.993 --> 00:55:09.034]  All these top actors, best actress this year.
[00:55:09.214 --> 00:55:09.934]  Bruce Willis.
[00:55:10.154 --> 00:55:15.596]  Bruce Willis, no longer being a neocon, saying they killed Kennedy and the same group that did that basically did 9-11.
[00:55:15.736 --> 00:55:17.936]  I mean, they're losing all their own people.
[00:55:17.976 --> 00:55:18.657]  What are they going to do?
[00:55:19.997 --> 00:55:30.320]  Well, unfortunately they'll probably go to the tactic of desperation, which is to launch another war or to set off a nuke or some terrible terrorist attack.
[00:55:30.879 --> 00:55:32.600]  I don't know, but they need to be stopped.
[00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:32.961]  Absolutely.
[00:55:55.527 --> 00:55:56.028]  Absolutely.
[00:55:56.088 --> 00:55:57.609]  And a little power is not enough.
[00:55:58.571 --> 00:56:02.715]  All of this is being orchestrated by the oligarchy that runs this country.
[00:56:02.795 --> 00:56:05.598]  The little, small, wealthy elite.
[00:56:05.919 --> 00:56:08.381]  And these people deal in millions of dollars.
[00:56:08.501 --> 00:56:11.485]  I mean, you know, five, ten million to them is pocket change.
[00:56:12.205 --> 00:56:15.229]  How much more wealth and power do you want?
[00:56:16.772 --> 00:56:18.934]  Well, it's their very nature to be hyper-competitive.
[00:56:19.654 --> 00:56:24.237]  And plus, just the mad scientists out there who will do anything.
[00:56:24.698 --> 00:56:33.684]  I mean, thousands of factories randomly splicing every type of DNA you can imagine, already giving rise to super viruses, super bacteria.
[00:56:33.965 --> 00:56:36.867]  I mean, that alone can create the Andromeda strain.
[00:56:36.887 --> 00:56:43.331]  I mean, that's why so many top scientists say they believe there's a very low probability that we'll even survive as a species, Jim.
[00:56:45.052 --> 00:56:49.295]  If we're going to survive, we better start paying attention and start standing up for ourselves.
[00:56:50.116 --> 00:57:02.664]  Well, I'm not an anti-technology person, but we need to put serious brakes on all of these hyper-sensitive technologies, because they admit they're doing all these experiments, having no idea what it's going to do.
[00:57:03.064 --> 00:57:08.708]  Well, what we need to do is pass laws that says all of this should be done in the open.
[00:57:09.168 --> 00:57:09.488]  Okay?
[00:57:09.588 --> 00:57:12.250]  Everybody needs to know what they're working on, how they're working on it.
[00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:13.231]  Okay?
[00:57:13.391 --> 00:57:19.555]  And that way, then the public can thoughtfully decide if that's proper or not.
[00:57:19.575 --> 00:57:21.916]  But like Dick Cheney says, he doesn't care what the people want.
[00:57:21.936 --> 00:57:24.098]  It doesn't matter to the leader what they want.
[00:57:24.238 --> 00:57:25.479]  Fire up your website, Jim Mars.
[00:57:26.138 --> 00:57:26.819]  JimMars.com.
[00:57:26.839 --> 00:57:30.004]  Jim, I want to have you on in the next few weeks for two hours.
[00:57:30.044 --> 00:57:31.486]  We can really break all this down.
[00:57:31.526 --> 00:57:32.428]  Thanks for spending time with us.
[00:57:32.768 --> 00:57:33.209]  Okay.
[00:57:33.409 --> 00:57:33.910]  Take care.
[00:57:34.090 --> 00:57:34.350]  You bet.
[00:57:34.371 --> 00:57:35.392]  There goes Jim Mars.
[00:57:35.452 --> 00:57:36.354]  JimMars.com.

[00:57:39.819 --> 00:57:40.420]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:43.849 --> 00:57:44.790]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:57:44.850 --> 00:57:47.972]  As you know, GCN is a huge supporter of Ron Paul and all he stands for.
[00:57:48.092 --> 00:57:56.357]  That's why, for a limited time, I have personally set aside commercial inventory allowing advertisers the chance to show their personal support for Ron Paul while promoting their products.

[00:58:21.317 --> 00:58:28.882]  This low-mintage collector coin, with a total series mintage under $600,000, has sold at four times its current price.
[00:58:28.942 --> 00:58:32.405]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.

[00:59:57.540 --> 01:00:05.947]  Iraqi authorities have extended that curfew in Baghdad indefinitely to contain battles between the terrorist and Iraqi security teams.
[01:00:06.327 --> 01:00:10.851]  The move to extend the curfew comes as violence threatens to spiral out of control.
[01:00:11.411 --> 01:00:19.518]  One Iraqi Shiite cleric is telling his followers to hang on to their weapons in the face of pressure from Baghdad to surrender them.

[01:00:35.566 --> 01:00:43.409]  And repair work now underway on a jet fuel storage tank that sprang a leak earlier in the day at Reagan National Airport in Washington.
[01:00:43.850 --> 01:00:44.990]  No one was hurt.

[01:00:50.765 --> 01:00:51.465]  Psoriasis.
[01:00:51.665 --> 01:00:56.867]  The itching, flaking, and irritation is painful, but the emotional suffering can be even more devastating.
[01:00:56.987 --> 01:00:58.067]  My body was so sore.
[01:00:58.147 --> 01:00:59.288]  My mind was so worn out.
[01:00:59.348 --> 01:01:00.408]  I could not sleep at night.
[01:01:00.628 --> 01:01:01.648]  I felt self-conscious.
[01:01:01.668 --> 01:01:03.109]  Nobody knows what that flaking is.
[01:01:03.169 --> 01:01:05.570]  And people say, ew, it just made me feel like you're dirty.
[01:01:05.590 --> 01:01:06.630]  I don't want people knowing I have this.
[01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:07.130]  It's embarrassing.
[01:01:07.150 --> 01:01:08.550]  Of course I felt self-conscious.
[01:01:08.590 --> 01:01:09.931]  Not very attractive to look at.

[01:01:59.155 --> 01:02:10.519]  Authorities say the suspect allegedly entered Doctors Hospital in Columbus armed with three guns, killing two hospital employees and a truck driver before he was shot and wounded by an officer.
[01:02:10.539 --> 01:02:16.902]  Authorities say the suspect apparently had been holding a grudge against one of the nurses at the hospital since his
[01:02:19.627 --> 01:02:25.951]  Three seal hunters dying today when a fishing vessel capsized in icy waters off Canada.
[01:02:26.351 --> 01:02:28.692]  The ship carrying the hunters went down on the St.
[01:02:28.752 --> 01:02:35.597]  Lawrence Gulf after it had been reported to have steering problems and rolled over while being towed.
[01:02:35.937 --> 01:02:38.959]  Two of the six men aboard were rescued by another fishing boat.
[01:02:39.339 --> 01:02:41.681]  Divers are still searching for another fisherman.
[01:02:42.001 --> 01:02:44.883]  Officials say conditions were extremely rough.

[01:02:50.798 --> 01:02:55.039]  With a word about Israel, here's best-selling author and Bible teacher, Kay Arthur.
[01:02:55.119 --> 01:03:06.862]  If you could only visit one country, one nation on the face of this earth, it should be Israel, because then you'll never be the same.

[01:03:21.497 --> 01:03:30.459]  Although Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice says, quote, I don't do politics, she is talking about the speech on race given by Barack Obama.
[01:03:30.799 --> 01:03:37.261]  Rice says she watched the speech when Obama delivered it last week and thought it was important for a number of reasons.
[01:03:37.741 --> 01:03:48.384]  The top-ranking black in President Bush's cabinet says the United States has struggled with racial issues, calling them a paradox for the country, saying they have not been resolved.
[01:03:49.096 --> 01:03:59.022]  It could make for some awkward times in the Clinton home, but former first daughter Chelsea says her mother will make a better president than her dad was.
[01:03:59.042 --> 01:04:04.866]  Again, I don't take anything for granted, but hopefully, with Pennsylvania's help, she will be our next president.
[01:04:04.986 --> 01:04:06.867]  And yes, I do think she'll be a better president.
[01:04:07.407 --> 01:04:10.390]  The younger Clinton did not elaborate on her viewpoint.
[01:04:10.751 --> 01:04:18.399]  Researchers hope to expand the size of a study to determine the heart benefits of the controversial cholesterol fighter Vitorin.
[01:04:18.819 --> 01:04:20.421]  They expect results in 2012.

[01:06:27.694 --> 01:06:31.898]  Yuka Hisa Fujita is our guest for the next 30 minutes.
[01:06:32.779 --> 01:06:48.353]  He is a member of the Japanese Parliament, the Democratic Party of Japan, a member of the House of Councillors in the Diet, that's the elite chamber in Japan, and he's been speaking at 9-11 Truth Conferences in Sydney and other areas.
[01:06:49.214 --> 01:06:51.336]  He, of course, several months ago went public
[01:06:53.579 --> 01:07:08.734]  On national Japanese television in the house of counselors and brought a lot of information Documented at 9-11 as an inside job and that idea that information is taking hold in Japan and all over the world and so I want to welcome
[01:07:10.407 --> 01:07:12.208]  Mr. Fujita on the show with us.
[01:07:12.749 --> 01:07:25.198]  Sir, we really appreciate your research, your courage, and the fact that you do have the courage to speak out on an issue that more and more people know is true, but do not have the courage to speak out.
[01:07:25.218 --> 01:07:26.479]  So we appreciate your courage.
[01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:28.200]  Thank you so much.
[01:07:29.501 --> 01:07:32.423]  When did you first start to question the official story?
[01:07:32.463 --> 01:07:37.907]  When did you first begin to look into questions of 9-11 attacks?
[01:07:39.645 --> 01:07:48.410]  About two years ago when I watched the video of the plane flight and also some documents and some photos from two years ago.
[01:07:49.810 --> 01:07:54.333]  What was it like for you as you began to research some of the alternative views of 9-11?
[01:07:54.693 --> 01:07:56.674]  What was that awakening process like?
[01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:03.262]  Well, at the beginning, I thought I couldn't believe, you know, this can't be true.
[01:08:03.662 --> 01:08:23.089]  But then, last year, when I heard more about various facts and the photos, such as the collapse of the 7th building in the World Trade Center, and also have heard about the put options that were obviously conducted a few days before the 9-11,
[01:08:24.352 --> 01:08:24.592]  I think
[01:08:42.884 --> 01:08:50.607]  Well, I was very surprised that there were, yes, one or two people who said that I'm anti-American, anti-government, but a lot of people, a few dozens of people replied to my email
[01:09:12.265 --> 01:09:20.650]  Encouraging my efforts and thanked me for my courage to ask the questions in public to the Prime Minister.
[01:09:21.230 --> 01:09:30.115]  And I was also surprised that actually quite a few fellow MPs in my party had known bits and pieces of 9-11.
[01:09:30.675 --> 01:09:37.439]  Someone knew about some FBI person who testified in the commission
[01:09:38.119 --> 01:09:38.980]  Yes sir.
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:46.003]  For those that don't know what put options are, would you like to explain it to them?
[01:10:04.395 --> 01:10:07.296]  You can buy certain stocks by a set price.
[01:10:07.777 --> 01:10:18.102]  So if the price of the stock fell down, as it did for United Airlines and American Airlines, you can receive a lot of profit out of it.
[01:10:20.383 --> 01:10:26.466]  And then the government engaged in a cover-up of that, though it led back to the CIA director, Buzzy Krongart.
[01:10:28.887 --> 01:10:29.187]  Yes.
[01:10:29.507 --> 01:10:30.408]  Very suspicious.
[01:10:31.502 --> 01:10:33.103]  What about the fact that U.S.
[01:10:33.183 --> 01:10:40.630]  troops, 44,000 U.S., 18,000 British troops, aircraft carriers, had already massed around Afghanistan?
[01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:50.618]  President Bush, President Bushiro, had signed the document to attack Afghanistan the day before 9-11.
[01:10:53.365 --> 01:10:57.787]  Well, obviously various facts are coming up that the U.S.
[01:10:57.987 --> 01:11:02.848]  government obviously had been planning the attacks for Afghanistan and later for Iraq.
[01:11:03.469 --> 01:11:10.991]  Now, that is another reason why I thought to take up this question because, you know, 24 Japanese were killed in New York.
[01:11:11.491 --> 01:11:14.212]  And because of that, the Japanese government followed the U.S.
[01:11:14.252 --> 01:11:18.434]  government to go into the warfare in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[01:11:19.088 --> 01:11:27.094]  But when I asked the Prime Minister of Japan how those 24 Japanese were killed, he didn't actually answer properly.
[01:11:27.474 --> 01:11:33.598]  The Japanese government had not have physical evidence of how those 24 Japanese were killed.
[01:11:34.018 --> 01:11:41.243]  I asked them if DNA test was conducted for some of them, for those whose bodies were not found.
[01:11:41.703 --> 01:11:43.845]  The answer was that they do not have evidence.
[01:11:44.867 --> 01:11:52.476]  Well, even the FBI, sir, as you know, but listeners may not, does not have bin Laden listed as a wanted man for 9-11.
[01:11:53.957 --> 01:11:56.200]  The FBI won't even say bin Laden did it.
[01:11:57.099 --> 01:11:57.299]  Yeah.
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:02.886]  And this is why I am now asking written questions to the Prime Minister.
[01:12:02.926 --> 01:12:06.751]  We have a system to ask written questions to the Prime Minister properly.
[01:12:07.051 --> 01:12:15.582]  So I've been going on two rounds of questions and answers, and I have done the third question to be answered next week.
[01:12:16.934 --> 01:12:24.958]  So two separate times you have gone before the highest body of the Parliament, which you're a member of, and have brought this forward.
[01:12:24.978 --> 01:12:34.822]  I have to tell you, reading the faces of the Prime Minister and others, they looked very, I don't want to say afraid, but very concerned, very upset.
[01:12:35.122 --> 01:12:39.564]  They were not laughing at you, which again shows they know this is serious.
[01:12:40.788 --> 01:12:48.974]  Yes, actually what the Prime Minister was looking at was the Japanese translation of some of the quotes from Patriots Question 9-11.
[01:12:49.935 --> 01:13:02.584]  And I included, you know, former Minister of Defence of Germany and former President of Central Bank of Germany who admitted that there were good options.
[01:13:02.644 --> 01:13:05.126]  By the way, I went to see him the
[01:13:06.334 --> 01:13:11.219]  Chairman of Bundesbank, Central Bank of Germany, who had said there were good options.
[01:13:11.359 --> 01:13:14.962]  I met him in person a few weeks ago in Europe.
[01:13:15.703 --> 01:13:22.570]  And therefore the Prime Minister in the hearing in Japan could not deny what I was trying to prove.
[01:13:24.404 --> 01:13:25.745]  Amazing, amazing.
[01:13:25.925 --> 01:13:27.825]  People with your type of courage may save us.
[01:13:27.985 --> 01:13:32.407]  We have Andres von Bulow, who was the defense head in Parliament.
[01:13:32.847 --> 01:13:39.129]  We have the former, very respected President of Italy saying that the U.S.
[01:13:39.169 --> 01:13:44.551]  staged terror attacks, which have been declassified in Europe to blame it on Communists.
[01:13:44.591 --> 01:13:45.892]  Gulf of Tonkin was staged.
[01:13:45.972 --> 01:13:47.272]  USS Liberty was staged.
[01:13:47.312 --> 01:13:49.233]  That's now been declassified.
[01:13:50.325 --> 01:13:52.145]  I want to be clear, it's not our whole government.
[01:13:52.185 --> 01:13:55.366]  It is criminals inside of it doing this.
[01:13:56.646 --> 01:13:59.867]  What are they going to do as the truth begins to break through the dam?
[01:14:01.787 --> 01:14:08.228]  Well, I studied from the aspect of the 24 Japanese killed.
[01:14:09.388 --> 01:14:15.790]  And the government also has said, in answering to my question, that terrorism is a crime.
[01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:18.230]  And if it is a crime, you have to investigate.
[01:14:18.877 --> 01:14:38.689]  Therefore, I urge the Japanese government to invest directly or indirectly, then to verify if it was right for Japan to support the warfare in Afghanistan and Iraq, then eventually ask the Japanese government to ask the US government to have proper investigation again.
[01:14:39.049 --> 01:14:43.172]  And this is something we parliamentarians of various countries could ask.
[01:14:43.572 --> 01:14:46.194]  I was in Europe meeting with European MPs,
[01:14:46.843 --> 01:14:50.245]  The perpetrators, I think, are starting to get scared.
[01:15:04.188 --> 01:15:05.249]  Um, I don't know.
[01:15:05.390 --> 01:15:09.995]  Therefore, some people say that I better be careful about my own, you know, life.
[01:15:10.576 --> 01:15:16.182]  They better be careful because millions of people who have courage like yourself are starting to stand up.
[01:15:16.282 --> 01:15:17.504]  Stay there, policer.
[01:15:18.105 --> 01:15:22.570]  We'll be right back with our guest, member of the Japanese Parliament,
[01:15:24.443 --> 01:15:25.843]  It is a big idea.
[01:15:53.075 --> 01:15:54.135]  A New World Order.
[01:15:54.835 --> 01:15:59.137]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:15:59.157 --> 01:16:01.897]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:16:02.557 --> 01:16:04.778]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:16:05.338 --> 01:16:07.799]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:16:08.519 --> 01:16:15.841]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:16:18.869 --> 01:16:23.833]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:16:24.333 --> 01:16:27.595]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:16:27.635 --> 01:16:30.657]  The Oval Bureau is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:16:30.757 --> 01:16:31.918]  Most people have no idea.
[01:16:31.938 --> 01:16:32.679]  They're not after money.
[01:16:32.699 --> 01:16:33.780]  They have all the money they need.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:34.700]  They're after power.
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:35.801]  That's what happens here.

[01:16:44.847 --> 01:16:45.208]  Endgame.
[01:16:45.608 --> 01:16:47.129]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:16:47.629 --> 01:16:48.769]  You have been warned.
[01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:51.410]  Hi neighbor.
[01:16:52.611 --> 01:16:54.331]  We all know that knowledge is power.
[01:16:54.751 --> 01:16:57.853]  We've tried to give you knowledge to help you prepare for rough times.
[01:16:58.473 --> 01:17:03.154]  There's the worldwide famine and our country's dependence on often dangerous food imports.
[01:17:03.795 --> 01:17:05.775]  You know about genetically poisoned food.
[01:17:06.315 --> 01:17:11.897]  Two-thirds of the food is disappearing with the bees along with huge crop failures from all-time record water shortages.
[01:17:12.618 --> 01:17:16.279]  You know they're turning food into fuel with corn ethanol plants.
[01:17:17.219 --> 01:17:20.922]  If we do not control our food, food will be used to control us.
[01:17:21.462 --> 01:17:26.606]  Food control has been the plan historically in every enslaved population and is the plan for America.
[01:17:27.286 --> 01:17:35.532]  The only value of the knowledge you have to take control of your food is if you choose to get a supply while you still have the freedom to choose.
[01:17:36.012 --> 01:17:37.273]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.

[01:17:50.367 --> 01:17:56.569]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:17:57.029 --> 01:18:04.791]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:18:05.152 --> 01:18:12.974]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:18:13.314 --> 01:18:18.058]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:18:18.398 --> 01:18:23.122]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:18:23.622 --> 01:18:27.486]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:18:27.966 --> 01:18:28.987]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:18:29.067 --> 01:18:33.150]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[01:18:38.475 --> 01:18:40.977]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[01:18:46.559 --> 01:18:51.281]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:18:51.581 --> 01:18:55.042]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:18:55.202 --> 01:18:57.063]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:18:57.663 --> 01:19:00.424]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:19:00.744 --> 01:19:06.247]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:19:06.507 --> 01:19:10.509]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:19:10.789 --> 01:19:15.731]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[01:19:48.114 --> 01:19:48.854]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:19:52.213 --> 01:19:54.294]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:19:54.834 --> 01:20:04.019]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:20:04.059 --> 01:20:12.924]  Yukihisa Fujita is our guest, senior member of the Japanese parliament, one of the leaders of his party, the Democratic Party of Japan.
[01:20:12.964 --> 01:20:18.807]  He is in the elite upper house of the Diet,
[01:20:21.755 --> 01:20:27.116]  The Councilors area, House of the Councilors, and he joins us here today.
[01:20:28.717 --> 01:20:39.320]  We have stories up on PrisonPlanet.com of the hundreds of CIA section chiefs from the U.S., other intelligence directors, two different former heads of German intelligence.
[01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:41.220]  I mean, it goes on and on.
[01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:42.320]  Russian generals.
[01:20:42.881 --> 01:20:43.821]  Anyone who looks at 9-11
[01:20:45.282 --> 01:20:55.131]  Uh, Mr. Fujita, isn't it an insult to our intelligence when we have firemen and police on video saying, get back, they're going to blow up building seven, they're going to bring it down.
[01:20:55.451 --> 01:20:57.933]  And we have all these witnesses and, and, and all of this happening.
[01:20:58.474 --> 01:21:04.099]  Why do you think the perpetrators thought we were so stupid and that they could do this in plain view?
[01:21:06.020 --> 01:21:12.286]  I think, uh, they did not think that the internet world was so, um,
[01:21:12.904 --> 01:21:19.951]  Prevailing that citizens can have access to those informations years later what happened.
[01:21:20.531 --> 01:21:34.405]  But you know, I have been to Europe to see the truth seekers in 11 European countries and I have also been to Australia to a conference on 9-11 organized by truth seekers there.
[01:21:35.069 --> 01:21:38.731]  You know, the internet was an invention by the military people.
[01:21:39.211 --> 01:21:42.233]  But now, citizens are making the best use of it.
[01:21:42.613 --> 01:21:46.274]  And citizens now can have access to the information.
[01:21:46.395 --> 01:21:50.757]  So, what has been able to be hidden by now cannot be hidden anymore.
[01:21:51.017 --> 01:21:54.939]  And they have opened Pandora's box, I think inadvertently.
[01:21:55.479 --> 01:21:56.239]  You're absolutely right.
[01:21:56.279 --> 01:21:59.281]  And to be clear, you just had a presentation
[01:21:59.901 --> 01:22:04.543]  Yes, and I think the film shown in the United, I mean, EU building was a film called Zero, made by an Italian member of parliament.
[01:22:26.730 --> 01:22:38.444]  Now, the important thing about The Zero is that this film is not meant to be shown in the internet world, but in the film theatres in various cities, in various countries.
[01:22:38.804 --> 01:22:46.634]  And I think the most important thing now is that we have to go out from internet world to sort of daylight world.
[01:22:47.234 --> 01:22:47.895]  That's right.
[01:22:47.935 --> 01:22:53.439]  We have to take it out of the cyberspace and then physically manifest in the three-dimensional universe.
[01:23:02.884 --> 01:23:03.925]  Well, you're helping do that.
[01:23:04.565 --> 01:23:15.052]  I mean, when we've got all the top actors, and Willie Nelson, and the media can't ignore them, but they are ignoring the scientists and experts because they're afraid.
[01:23:15.413 --> 01:23:18.755]  How do we force them to look at all the scientists and experts?
[01:23:18.835 --> 01:23:21.917]  And Bill Christensen was a CIA section chief in Europe.
[01:23:21.957 --> 01:23:23.918]  I mean, this guy's very high-level.
[01:23:23.979 --> 01:23:25.039]  He's saying inside job.
[01:23:25.299 --> 01:23:26.300]  How do they ignore that?
[01:23:27.841 --> 01:23:30.363]  Well, I think the team efforts
[01:23:30.905 --> 01:23:53.504]  By the scientists of various continents together, and the politicians of various continents together, and the media people of various continents together, to have a common sort of strategy to pursue the investigation of the thing, either through the UN or various European MPs' network.
[01:23:54.665 --> 01:23:59.009]  And I have been very encouraged by various US politicians
[01:23:59.724 --> 01:23:59.824]  Yes.
[01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:10.742]  Investigation again on those productions.
[01:24:11.022 --> 01:24:14.204]  Yes, we had him on the announcement a few months ago.
[01:24:14.865 --> 01:24:16.366]  And boy, they have gone after him.
[01:24:17.307 --> 01:24:22.770]  The good news is, if we don't expose the people that did this, and they've now been caught.
[01:24:22.911 --> 01:24:25.332]  Gulf of Tonkin declassified to get us into Vietnam.
[01:24:25.893 --> 01:24:28.034]  USS Liberty declassified, that was staged.
[01:24:28.074 --> 01:24:28.895]  Chicago Tribune.
[01:24:30.016 --> 01:24:33.959]  So many things, that they killed Kennedy, they killed Bobby Kennedy, all coming out.
[01:24:34.795 --> 01:24:39.518]  Very small military group controlled by a few central banks in Europe.
[01:24:40.118 --> 01:24:42.259]  They cannot stand exposure.
[01:24:42.539 --> 01:24:49.503]  But if we don't expose them, as you know, Mr. Fujita, Member of Parliament, they are going to continue to use the problem-reaction solution.
[01:24:50.784 --> 01:24:54.466]  Same thing Hitler used, firebombing his own Reichstag to take over Germany.
[01:24:54.846 --> 01:24:59.129]  I mean, do you agree that we've got to expose them or they will continue to stage more events?
[01:25:02.850 --> 01:25:03.951]  Yes, I think so.
[01:25:04.231 --> 01:25:16.061]  The way we have been, or you have been, exposing the things more in the internet world, now has to expose those things in physical media means.
[01:25:16.741 --> 01:25:19.824]  You told me you'd seen some of my films or pieces of them.
[01:25:19.904 --> 01:25:20.744]  Which have you seen?
[01:25:20.985 --> 01:25:22.326]  Because I'm going to send you all of them.
[01:25:24.127 --> 01:25:24.327]  Yes.
[01:25:25.586 --> 01:25:31.570]  Sorry, I have seen various films by so many people, so I can't sort of remember which of you have.
[01:25:31.590 --> 01:25:32.811]  Well, I will send them all to you.
[01:25:33.192 --> 01:25:34.192]  My film... Yes, please.
[01:25:34.733 --> 01:25:39.977]  I think our strongest point is the science, but also the admission of false flag terror.
[01:25:39.997 --> 01:25:43.159]  You know, the fact that governments have been caught doing it before.
[01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:49.784]  I don't think the public realizes that false flag inside job is so popular in history.
[01:25:51.165 --> 01:25:51.365]  Yeah.
[01:25:51.945 --> 01:25:53.627]  I think we seem to have more
[01:25:54.582 --> 01:25:55.062]  I think so.
[01:26:08.803 --> 01:26:15.885]  And to make those evidences to be more visual by the common people who do not use computers.
[01:26:16.045 --> 01:26:16.405]  Yes, sir.
[01:26:16.485 --> 01:26:31.070]  In closing, when you were there at the highest level of the Japanese Parliament presenting video clips and stills of firemen talking about bombs going off and being told to get back they were going to blow it up, what was the average response of other members of Parliament?
[01:26:31.090 --> 01:26:34.051]  Were they... they looked shocked to be seeing this.
[01:26:34.131 --> 01:26:34.791]  Were they shocked?
[01:26:36.212 --> 01:26:38.434]  They were shocked and they were surprised.
[01:26:38.654 --> 01:26:46.700]  And the number 7 building story, I think the most compelling, most convincing for them to understand.
[01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:54.525]  And production was another sort of convincing element.
[01:26:56.167 --> 01:26:56.947]  Absolutely.
[01:26:58.468 --> 01:27:03.892]  In Japan, I've been told that people are really starting to get into 9-11 million inside jobs.
[01:27:03.932 --> 01:27:04.513]  Is that the case?
[01:27:06.107 --> 01:27:18.074]  Well, as I said, quite a few, several dozen MPs in my party now are quite convinced about the wrongs about 9-11's official report.
[01:27:18.394 --> 01:27:24.017]  And they are supporting me to have a more thorough sort of approach.
[01:27:24.137 --> 01:27:29.040]  And tomorrow morning in Japan, actually, I'm invited to properly report
[01:27:29.932 --> 01:27:34.698]  To the federal MPs in my party on my time at the European Parliament and Australia.
[01:27:34.718 --> 01:27:37.562]  So you're going to be reporting to the government, the federal government?
[01:27:37.622 --> 01:27:37.943]  No, no.
[01:27:38.443 --> 01:27:41.547]  Not to my party, federal members in my party.
[01:27:41.607 --> 01:27:42.569]  Okay, so to your party.
[01:27:42.589 --> 01:27:47.315]  To my own party, I would like to enlarge to the MPs of other parties.
[01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:48.900]  Absolutely.
[01:27:48.961 --> 01:27:58.686]  Well, we really appreciate your time, and again, I'd like to have you back on as your operation against tyranny expands, and definitely work together.
[01:27:58.706 --> 01:28:01.948]  And again, we appreciate your amazing courage.
[01:28:01.988 --> 01:28:06.270]  The type of courage you and others are showing is what just may save us.
[01:28:06.330 --> 01:28:08.111]  Without you, we are lost.
[01:28:08.372 --> 01:28:09.072]  God bless you.
[01:28:09.112 --> 01:28:09.792]  Godspeed.
[01:28:10.073 --> 01:28:11.894]  We commend you, Mr. Fujita.
[01:28:13.297 --> 01:28:13.917]  Thank you so much.
[01:28:13.957 --> 01:28:14.737]  Very kind of you.
[01:28:14.897 --> 01:28:15.978]  Take care and thank you for speaking.
[01:28:15.998 --> 01:28:16.698]  We work together.
[01:28:16.718 --> 01:28:17.458]  We work together.
[01:28:17.778 --> 01:28:18.158]  Yes, sir.
[01:28:18.238 --> 01:28:18.878]  Thank you.
[01:28:19.558 --> 01:28:20.059]  Godspeed.
[01:28:20.079 --> 01:28:20.419]  Thank you.
[01:28:20.999 --> 01:28:21.359]  Take care.
[01:28:21.379 --> 01:28:22.579]  All right.
[01:28:22.619 --> 01:28:22.979]  Bye-bye.
[01:28:23.459 --> 01:28:23.840]  Okay.
[01:28:23.900 --> 01:28:25.700]  Amazing individual, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:28.341]  We really appreciate him spending time with us.
[01:28:28.401 --> 01:28:29.501]  Infowars.com.
[01:28:29.821 --> 01:28:30.521]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:28:30.541 --> 01:28:34.722]  We're going to come back, take a bunch of your calls on this subject and a lot of others at 877-590-5525.
[01:28:34.742 --> 01:28:35.282]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:43.285 --> 01:28:43.365]  Yeah.
[01:28:50.174 --> 01:28:50.814]  It's a fact.
[01:28:51.034 --> 01:28:58.517]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[01:28:58.637 --> 01:29:07.500]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[01:29:07.780 --> 01:29:18.324]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecure debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:29:18.584 --> 01:29:24.669]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[01:29:24.889 --> 01:29:29.914]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[01:29:30.094 --> 01:29:34.598]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[01:29:34.738 --> 01:29:36.540]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:36.880]  That's 877-943-8600.

[01:29:51.832 --> 01:29:57.577]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[01:29:57.917 --> 01:30:03.542]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high-stress lifestyles.
[01:30:03.862 --> 01:30:07.725]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[01:30:08.025 --> 01:30:12.929]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[01:30:13.169 --> 01:30:21.314]  At SnyderHealth.com, we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science, the leader in water ionization technology for over 25 years.

[01:30:45.494 --> 01:30:46.655]  That's SnyderHealth.com.
[01:30:50.296 --> 01:30:52.417]  All you men out there, you need to listen up.
[01:30:52.757 --> 01:30:57.900]  By the age of 60, 1 in 2 men already have a prostate-related health issue.
[01:30:58.060 --> 01:30:58.740]  What does this mean?
[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:00.581]  It might be an enlarged prostate.
[01:31:00.821 --> 01:31:02.842]  Difficulty going to the bathroom.
[01:31:03.022 --> 01:31:04.723]  And a diminished sex drive.
[01:31:05.003 --> 01:31:06.004]  Not a pretty picture.
[01:31:06.284 --> 01:31:10.246]  If you're a man, you need to give your body nutrition to support prostate health.
[01:31:10.526 --> 01:31:11.586]  There's no question about it.
[01:31:11.626 --> 01:31:13.968]  Many people hear this and they might think Saw Palmetto.
[01:31:14.208 --> 01:31:16.529]  But there's something so much better out there.
[01:31:16.909 --> 01:31:23.311]  It's called Beta Prostate, and it contains 3,000 times more healthy plant sterols than ordinary saw palmetto.
[01:31:23.451 --> 01:31:26.993]  So before you try anything else, try Beta Prostate.
[01:31:27.413 --> 01:31:29.994]  Ignoring your prostate's not going to make the problems go away.
[01:31:30.294 --> 01:31:35.055]  Taking Beta Prostate is guaranteed to provide effective, all-natural support.
[01:31:35.075 --> 01:31:35.395]  Dial 1-800-457-9914.
[01:31:35.415 --> 01:31:35.696]  That's 1-800-457-9914.
[01:31:35.716 --> 01:31:38.877]  Call now and find out how you can get a free bottle of Beta Prostate with your order.
[01:31:45.899 --> 01:31:48.720]  Dial 1-800-457-9914.
[01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:49.541]  Call now!
[01:31:49.821 --> 01:31:50.101]  Fact.
[01:31:50.281 --> 01:31:56.184]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[01:31:56.324 --> 01:32:00.566]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[01:32:00.666 --> 01:32:08.150]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[01:32:08.370 --> 01:32:08.970]  The solution.
[01:32:09.150 --> 01:32:13.212]  Detoxification integrated with Electro-Qi Premier Energy Foot Spa.
[01:32:13.372 --> 01:32:22.376]  The Electro-Qi Premier Energy Foot Spa helps to aid in cleansing the body of harmful toxins while energizing and oxygenating your entire body at the cellular level.

[01:32:35.561 --> 01:32:37.343]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:32:37.403 --> 01:32:39.345]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today!
[01:33:04.853 --> 01:33:09.962]  Yeah, I do a syndicated radio show for more than 11 years, Monday through Friday.
[01:33:11.304 --> 01:33:12.045]  That wasn't enough.
[01:33:13.868 --> 01:33:15.371]  No, I come in Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:19.222 --> 01:33:21.704]  Central Standard Time, and this show's growing by leaps and bounds.
[01:33:22.064 --> 01:33:31.372]  We're glad you're listening on AM and FM stations from San Diego to Kansas City to Niagara Falls to Austin, Texas, where we come to you from NewsRadio 590 KLBJ from the studios.
[01:33:31.992 --> 01:33:37.417]  Simulcast on the internet at InfoWars.com and at Global Shortwave WWCR as well as Shortwave.
[01:33:39.779 --> 01:33:40.479]  Okay, here's the deal.
[01:33:40.579 --> 01:33:42.121]  I know we'll have calls all over the map.
[01:33:42.161 --> 01:33:44.563]  A bunch of different issues.
[01:33:44.603 --> 01:33:47.345]  In the final segment, I'm going to head on mobile phones.
[01:33:47.385 --> 01:33:48.446]  More dangerous than smoking.
[01:33:49.716 --> 01:33:53.318]  The Attorney General says that copyright violation is an act of terrorism.
[01:33:54.638 --> 01:33:57.620]  Not having your teeth brushed will be terrorism before they're done.
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:02.122]  Also, what's happening in Baghdad, a little bit of what I'll be hitting on before we end this transmission.
[01:34:02.962 --> 01:34:05.823]  Right now, though, let's go ahead and go to these loaded phone lines.
[01:34:07.464 --> 01:34:11.066]  Let's talk to John in Florida, been holding the longest.
[01:34:11.846 --> 01:34:13.807]  You are on the air, John.
[01:34:13.867 --> 01:34:14.187]  Welcome.
[01:34:15.208 --> 01:34:15.608]  Hi, Alex.
[01:34:15.928 --> 01:34:16.128]  Hello.
[01:34:17.136 --> 01:34:18.956]  Yes, I want to make this quick as possible.
[01:34:18.976 --> 01:34:23.917]  I have a cell phone, so I want to get this microwave away from my head before it increases my brain temperature too much.
[01:34:23.957 --> 01:34:24.537]  Don't say that!
[01:34:24.577 --> 01:34:27.458]  That hurts valuable infrastructure, bad mouths, U.S.
[01:34:27.478 --> 01:34:28.478]  companies, you're with Al-Qaeda.
[01:34:28.518 --> 01:34:29.018]  Go ahead, shut up.
[01:34:29.518 --> 01:34:30.098]  I understand that.
[01:34:30.478 --> 01:34:44.501]  But I would just like to speak about the cost of... I don't know whether the cost, for me, has been more from the economic downturn or, say, from trying to relate this information to people I know.
[01:34:45.958 --> 01:34:47.039]  I live in Florida.
[01:34:47.099 --> 01:34:50.841]  My mom is a real estate broker and now she is broke.
[01:34:51.681 --> 01:34:53.362]  My dad is a contractor of Georgia.
[01:34:53.822 --> 01:34:59.805]  He is selling the houses he has contracted to get out from under them from keep losing money.
[01:35:00.906 --> 01:35:06.949]  And I try to relate this information to people about how the IMS documents came out saying that they were going to bust it.
[01:35:07.751 --> 01:35:14.395]  Real estate bubble and, you know, all this other information, and people call me a brainwashed conspiracy theorist.
[01:35:14.535 --> 01:35:21.659]  Well, they're, no, they're the ones, they're scared that it's going to get worse, and it is scary to know this was all engineered.
[01:35:22.019 --> 01:35:24.560]  And it is, but even the financial towns of London admit that.
[01:35:25.101 --> 01:35:27.262]  It is scary to find out there's bad people running things.
[01:35:27.782 --> 01:35:31.324]  And so they'd rather keep living in a fantasy land, but look, they're going to wake up, don't worry.
[01:35:31.344 --> 01:35:32.284]  I know.
[01:35:32.325 --> 01:35:34.786]  They're probably going to, it's too late, but you know, they're going to wake up.
[01:35:35.370 --> 01:35:37.772]  And I get into arguments with my boss.
[01:35:37.792 --> 01:35:46.198]  He's an ex-police officer, and now we're in the metals business, and we're sending out, you know, metals to China as fast as we can.
[01:35:46.258 --> 01:35:50.501]  And because he thinks he's making good money off this, the economy's fine.
[01:35:51.161 --> 01:36:01.008]  But, you know, his economic situation... Well, yeah, I mean, it's a recession when your neighbor's out of work.
[01:36:01.068 --> 01:36:02.389]  It's a depression when you're out of work.
[01:36:03.539 --> 01:36:06.862]  And I'm not saying he shouldn't even be in the raw business of selling raw material.
[01:36:07.503 --> 01:36:15.170]  The point is the government, and I appreciate your call, they set up in tax incentives to move offshore.
[01:36:15.431 --> 01:36:22.778]  And the globalists said they were going to get rid of all of our industries and drive us into debt so they could fully bankrupt us and then buy everything up for pennies on the dollar.
[01:36:24.793 --> 01:36:30.897]  You know, it's the Federal Reserve that set the policies in 93 and 99 that got everybody leveraged out.
[01:36:31.257 --> 01:36:33.598]  And the subprime mortgage is only one part of that, about a third of it.
[01:36:34.399 --> 01:36:35.960]  The credit cards, all of it.
[01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:36.680]  They knew.
[01:36:36.740 --> 01:36:37.941]  They issued credit out of nothing.
[01:36:38.261 --> 01:36:41.283]  They, the banks, bought up all the real assets while that was happening, or a lot of them.
[01:36:41.783 --> 01:36:47.527]  Now, they're, quote, bailing themselves out with more of our tax money as they devalue the dollar at the same time.
[01:36:47.867 --> 01:36:53.330]  And then the Federal Reserve, who engineered it all, who's just a shareholder in the global banking system,
[01:36:53.959 --> 01:36:55.319]  Federal Reserve is privately owned, folks.
[01:36:56.360 --> 01:36:57.840]  Most banks don't own stock in it.
[01:36:58.060 --> 01:36:59.040]  Things like Chase do.
[01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:00.761]  JPMorgan Chase.
[01:37:01.641 --> 01:37:04.121]  And that's why they quote, you know, do the bailouts.
[01:37:04.141 --> 01:37:05.282]  Well, they are the Federal Reserve.
[01:37:05.902 --> 01:37:08.442]  And so this is just criminal bank consolidation going on.
[01:37:09.663 --> 01:37:12.283]  And they want to hurt you and hurt you real bad.
[01:37:13.263 --> 01:37:15.904]  And that's why they got riot police and FEMA camps built.
[01:37:16.226 --> 01:37:18.406]  Because they plan to bring it down to absolute nothing.
[01:37:18.807 --> 01:37:21.287]  Now, they can do that this year, next year, three years from now, I don't know.
[01:37:21.767 --> 01:37:28.168]  But the IMF documents... Well, I mean, you know, your friends and family don't have to say they don't believe you.
[01:37:28.328 --> 01:37:30.229]  You can just go to the BBC.
[01:37:30.349 --> 01:37:36.470]  When it broke, Joseph Stiklitz, their chief economist, Nobel Prize winner, I've interviewed him several times, he went public.
[01:37:37.450 --> 01:37:38.491]  And the documents came out.
[01:37:39.091 --> 01:37:41.611]  And it said they were going to engineer collapses and do all of this.
[01:37:42.671 --> 01:37:43.912]  And so you can just take them that.
[01:37:44.072 --> 01:37:45.332]  They'll probably say that's not true either.
[01:37:46.181 --> 01:37:49.043]  But if your family's laughing at you, move on.
[01:37:50.384 --> 01:37:51.845]  You know, pearls before swine.
[01:37:51.865 --> 01:37:53.866]  I'm not calling your parents pigs, but you know, Christ said that.
[01:37:54.607 --> 01:37:59.130]  Somebody wants to laugh and giggle, I mean, the average American can't find the U.S.
[01:37:59.190 --> 01:37:59.630]  on a map.
[01:37:59.670 --> 01:38:02.612]  The average American hardly knows how to wipe their hind end.
[01:38:05.494 --> 01:38:15.241]  Because their forebears were the smartest, toughest, most root-and-tootinest, hardest-working people there were, and we're the children of the children of the children of the children of spoiled, rotten people.
[01:38:16.434 --> 01:38:17.675]  So we're lambs of the slaughter!
[01:38:21.398 --> 01:38:23.300]  All you can do is tell them who's going to rape them.
[01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:24.441]  They're going to laugh at you.
[01:38:24.661 --> 01:38:27.263]  But after they're good and raped by the man, then they'll know.
[01:38:27.283 --> 01:38:28.804]  Let's go to the calls here.
[01:38:29.465 --> 01:38:32.528]  Let's go ahead and talk to Abdul in New York.
[01:38:32.548 --> 01:38:33.108]  You're on the air.
[01:38:34.890 --> 01:38:35.350]  Yes, hello?
[01:38:35.590 --> 01:38:36.171]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:38:36.551 --> 01:38:37.852]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:38:37.932 --> 01:38:39.513]  First time caller from New York.
[01:38:39.734 --> 01:38:40.034]  Welcome.
[01:38:40.074 --> 01:38:43.657]  I was listening to the Koch interview on Friday.
[01:38:44.238 --> 01:38:52.968]  And I was a little annoyed and, you know, to him being completely oblivious to, you know, the whole 9-11 building number 7.
[01:38:53.068 --> 01:38:58.635]  That's right, I interviewed former New York Mayor Koch, former Congressman, and he said basically, ban free speech is fine.
[01:38:59.155 --> 01:39:01.057]  Yeah, which doesn't make any sense.
[01:39:01.755 --> 01:39:02.376]  Well, yeah it does.
[01:39:02.396 --> 01:39:04.317]  They're gonna come arrest you if you speak.
[01:39:04.637 --> 01:39:05.638]  It makes sense for the man.
[01:39:05.658 --> 01:39:13.325]  They're gonna tell people that America never had free speech, and that America fought free speech, and the dumb yuppies, they know how to apply makeup.
[01:39:13.545 --> 01:39:15.546]  They know how to act tough at the sports bar.
[01:39:15.707 --> 01:39:16.968]  They don't know what America is.
[01:39:17.328 --> 01:39:17.888]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:39:17.908 --> 01:39:18.589]  And then he claims
[01:39:19.048 --> 01:39:23.150]  You know, nothing was worse than the Holocaust of World War II.
[01:39:23.210 --> 01:39:26.511]  I mean, what about the Holocaust of the Russian kulak farmers?
[01:39:26.671 --> 01:39:27.311]  You know what I mean?
[01:39:27.771 --> 01:39:31.593]  What about the Holocaust of more than 50 million black people?
[01:39:32.393 --> 01:39:33.293]  Of course, exactly.
[01:39:33.353 --> 01:39:45.998]  Did you know that about 55% of people in the transatlantic slave trade from the late 1400s right through to the 1800s, that over half the people on each ship of 400 slaves would die?
[01:39:46.673 --> 01:39:47.194]  Exactly.
[01:39:47.634 --> 01:39:53.020]  And even that, back to the Holocaust... Well, look, the Holocaust was terrible.
[01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:58.745]  My point is, is that it's not the worst thing that ever happened in history.
[01:39:59.486 --> 01:40:03.310]  Yeah, I know, but he was completely oblivious to everything you said.
[01:40:03.350 --> 01:40:04.371]  I mean, of course he knows.
[01:40:05.070 --> 01:40:08.974]  Well, my issue was that we shouldn't take people's free speech.
[01:40:09.635 --> 01:40:15.480]  And in Europe, they're taking free speech to criticize the government now, and that's in the news, and he just said I was a liar.
[01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:24.629]  Well, we're going to take that Ed Koch video of me interviewing him, we videotaped it, and we're going to put news articles over everything he's saying with the headlines.
[01:40:25.307 --> 01:40:26.807]  So don't worry, we win, see?
[01:40:27.528 --> 01:40:32.189]  He's used to the old media way of a bunch of ignoramuses just thinking he's telling the truth.
[01:40:32.389 --> 01:40:33.509]  We're going to just slam him.
[01:40:34.090 --> 01:40:35.490]  Every statement he makes, we're going to hit him.
[01:40:36.190 --> 01:40:37.431]  Thanks Alex, good talking to you.
[01:40:37.531 --> 01:40:38.991]  Yeah, good talking to you, I appreciate it.
[01:40:39.191 --> 01:40:40.731]  Look, I got caught trying to be friendly.
[01:40:40.811 --> 01:40:49.294]  I got caught talking about his book and bashing Giuliani, and I just brought up how he supports these commissions that want to ban free speech, and he just said, yeah, I want to ban free speech.
[01:40:50.254 --> 01:40:52.775]  He plain blank said, you don't need free speech, it's not good.
[01:40:55.032 --> 01:40:57.353]  And, uh, you know, that's not, that's un-American.
[01:40:58.813 --> 01:41:01.134]  Let's go, I mean, I can't believe we have to argue about this now.
[01:41:01.454 --> 01:41:02.935]  Paul in Montana, you're on the air.
[01:41:03.695 --> 01:41:04.855]  Yeah, Alex, good show.
[01:41:04.955 --> 01:41:05.295]  Thank you.
[01:41:06.096 --> 01:41:22.221]  Yeah, hey, listen, now, when I hear the, uh, the Japanese fellow speak, uh, it brings to mind, uh, what this guy Benjamin Fulfer had to say about, uh, the Japanese and, uh... Yeah, Forbes, right, that their government found out about the black-op plan to use bioweapons to kill most Asians, which is now declassified as the real upset, yes.
[01:41:23.007 --> 01:41:23.207]  Right.
[01:41:23.427 --> 01:41:24.509]  Well, that's very interesting.
[01:41:24.549 --> 01:41:29.273]  You know, you talk about how the Americans are so dumbed down they can't think for themselves or do anything for themselves.
[01:41:29.714 --> 01:41:37.621]  I wonder if it will actually take other governments having the courage and the power to speak up and start exposing and coming out and helping.
[01:41:37.641 --> 01:41:40.284]  We've already had number three in the Blair government, Michael Meacher.
[01:41:40.304 --> 01:41:41.866]  I flew to London to interview him three years ago.
[01:41:42.526 --> 01:41:44.567]  Terror Storm, say it's an inside job.
[01:41:45.108 --> 01:41:50.151]  Look, we've already had all these former CIA, I mean, Ronald Reagan's top CIA advisors gone public.
[01:41:50.491 --> 01:41:51.792]  The guy that advised him every morning.
[01:41:52.112 --> 01:41:56.094]  Ronald Reagan's favorite CIA intel analyst, I mean, has come out.
[01:41:56.135 --> 01:42:00.697]  I mean, what more, look, the media just better hope that they can keep covering this up.
[01:42:00.717 --> 01:42:01.578]  No, but they can't.
[01:42:01.678 --> 01:42:02.558]  It's going to come out.
[01:42:02.919 --> 01:42:11.384]  Look, and I don't want to say Americans, Americans are statistically the lowest test scores now in the world.
[01:42:12.622 --> 01:42:16.143]  Statistically the most dumbed down, but everybody else is dumbed down too.
[01:42:16.344 --> 01:42:20.966]  Alex, here's another plea for those who know to speak forward and use your show as the platform.
[01:42:21.126 --> 01:42:21.766]  Good work, Alex.
[01:42:22.166 --> 01:42:22.806]  Thank you, my friend.
[01:42:22.826 --> 01:42:24.447]  We'll just keep bringing you bigger and bigger guests.
[01:42:25.187 --> 01:42:27.888]  Yeah, we had a bunch of big guests last week.
[01:42:28.349 --> 01:42:30.950]  I got a huge guest coming up Tuesday to be unannounced.
[01:42:31.630 --> 01:42:34.154]  And then you'll hear highlights on the Sunday show, don't worry.
[01:42:34.915 --> 01:42:40.202]  And it just gets, later in the month, mega massive, guys.
[01:42:40.542 --> 01:42:46.951]  Next Monday, not this Monday, tomorrow, but 8-9 days from now, huge announcement on that Monday at InfoWars.com.
[01:42:46.991 --> 01:42:48.193]  We'll be right back, final segment.
[01:42:50.475 --> 01:42:52.997]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:42:53.337 --> 01:42:54.598]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[01:42:54.899 --> 01:42:56.900]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:42:57.040 --> 01:42:58.802]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:42:58.942 --> 01:43:00.183]  The late, great USA.
[01:43:00.443 --> 01:43:01.844]  America, freedom to fascism.
[01:43:02.205 --> 01:43:09.050]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[01:43:49.134 --> 01:43:52.356]  Hi neighbor, this is Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[01:43:52.936 --> 01:43:55.478]  Life is a gamble, but you can stack the deck.
[01:43:56.458 --> 01:44:05.706]  If you knew what I know about all the problems food will protect you from, you'd start immediately to put every effort and dollar you can get into the biggest supply of food possible.
[01:44:06.406 --> 01:44:11.651]  When the dollar and economy crash, when the imported and genetically poisoned food is all that's left.
[01:44:12.291 --> 01:44:20.577]  When the quarantine and bird flu hit, our only protection and only chance to be fearless is having control of our own supply of food and enough of it.
[01:44:20.857 --> 01:44:28.543]  But if you knew what we haven't yet discovered, you wouldn't waste time listening to the rest of this announcement before charging out and getting a serious food supply.
[01:44:29.083 --> 01:44:31.905]  Decide, it's food now or probably never.
[01:44:32.306 --> 01:44:33.627]  But can you afford to be wrong?
[01:44:34.267 --> 01:44:34.988]  Decide now.
[01:44:35.448 --> 01:44:36.189]  Place your bet.
[01:44:37.009 --> 01:44:38.471]  Can you afford to be wrong?
[01:44:38.851 --> 01:44:40.252]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[01:44:40.272 --> 01:44:40.413]  Call 800-409-5633.

[01:44:40.913 --> 01:44:41.694]  A new world order.
[01:44:42.034 --> 01:44:43.255]  In the near future.
[01:44:56.866 --> 01:44:59.527]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:44:59.947 --> 01:45:02.107]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:45:02.768 --> 01:45:05.008]  Put their objective being world domination.
[01:45:05.548 --> 01:45:07.989]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:45:08.729 --> 01:45:16.031]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:45:19.076 --> 01:45:24.540]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[01:45:28.402 --> 01:45:30.924]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for the world government.
[01:45:30.964 --> 01:45:32.125]  Most people have no idea.
[01:45:32.145 --> 01:45:32.905]  They're not after money.
[01:45:32.925 --> 01:45:33.986]  They have all the money they need.
[01:45:34.206 --> 01:45:34.907]  They're after power.
[01:45:35.187 --> 01:45:36.187]  That's what they're after.

[01:45:47.855 --> 01:45:48.876]  You have been warned.
[01:45:49.556 --> 01:45:51.038]  America needs Ron Paul.
[01:45:51.258 --> 01:45:52.319]  He needs your support.
[01:45:52.539 --> 01:45:53.540]  The time is now.
[01:45:53.921 --> 01:45:57.804]  As long as he has your support, he will continue to fight until the very end.
[01:45:58.145 --> 01:46:02.228]  We know that many people would like to show their support, but want to do it on a larger scale.

[01:46:47.232 --> 01:46:48.934]  Fly a Ron Paul flag today.
[01:46:53.578 --> 01:46:55.960]  Are you tired of searching for great talk radio?
[01:46:56.060 --> 01:46:57.281]  Well, search no more.
[01:46:57.341 --> 01:46:59.523]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:47:07.762 --> 01:47:16.824]  Final segment, and I'm going to be taking a lot of your phone calls, so if I'm going to do that, you've got to have your question and your comment ready, because I'm moving to the next person quick here.

[01:47:23.846 --> 01:47:25.146]  We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.
[01:47:25.166 --> 01:47:29.367]  We wouldn't be fighting the man on a global front if it wasn't for you.

[01:47:39.310 --> 01:47:40.832]  I want you right beside me.
[01:47:41.712 --> 01:47:43.934]  We're on our way to bringing the New World Order to justice.
[01:47:44.554 --> 01:47:46.275]  The alternatives abject slavery.
[01:47:48.257 --> 01:47:49.818]  Shattering the left-right paradigm.
[01:47:49.838 --> 01:47:52.800]  Let's go to Paul in Austin.
[01:47:52.820 --> 01:47:54.702]  Paul, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:47:55.339 --> 01:47:57.120]  Yeah, Alex, thanks for taking my call today.
[01:47:57.160 --> 01:47:57.901]  Great show, brother.
[01:47:57.941 --> 01:47:58.321]  Thank you.
[01:47:58.841 --> 01:48:07.366]  Hey, man, briefly, I just wanted to let you know, in South Austin, our Republican Convention... You guys captured some delegate sectors.
[01:48:08.007 --> 01:48:08.447]  Oh, yes.
[01:48:08.607 --> 01:48:09.207]  Big time.
[01:48:09.808 --> 01:48:14.570]  It was a close fight, but our people took over the whole convention.
[01:48:15.151 --> 01:48:16.792]  I heard it went on for 18 hours.
[01:48:17.592 --> 01:48:19.213]  Well, the North one did.
[01:48:19.693 --> 01:48:21.134]  They had a little bit rougher time.
[01:48:21.415 --> 01:48:23.756]  And the Congressional District got taken over, too, didn't it?
[01:48:24.286 --> 01:48:24.946]  Yes, it did.
[01:48:24.966 --> 01:48:25.907]  It did.
[01:48:26.367 --> 01:48:33.489]  Now, for those that don't know how that works, and I even have studied it and it's hard to understand, so, Byzantine, this is a big deal.
[01:48:33.509 --> 01:48:38.851]  You guys are getting to now basically write the party platform at the state level, and if this continues, it could happen at the national level.
[01:48:39.552 --> 01:48:40.172]  Yeah, totally.
[01:48:40.192 --> 01:48:44.253]  We're going to have Ron Paul, anti-New World Order people, all through the machinery of the country.
[01:48:44.533 --> 01:48:45.834]  I'm all for it, I think it's wonderful.
[01:48:46.134 --> 01:48:49.095]  Is there still talk, though, of trying to go to the convention and demanding Ron Paul?
[01:48:50.206 --> 01:48:51.988]  Um, I haven't heard much about that.
[01:48:52.048 --> 01:48:56.791]  I've heard of some type of revolt on the floor, possibly, but I don't know what that would entail.
[01:48:56.811 --> 01:49:13.805]  Well, I'm for any revolt that stages these events, I mean, that exposes these staged events, but I don't like a revolt if they try to claim that they want him for president, because if you've got 60 delegates and McCain's got over a thousand, the media will crucify us with that, claiming we're stealing people's votes with the delegates.
[01:49:14.417 --> 01:49:17.119]  Yeah, people need to wake up to the truth about this all.
[01:49:17.159 --> 01:49:18.440]  We've done what we've done.
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:20.342]  I was so proud of everybody yesterday.
[01:49:21.543 --> 01:49:24.785]  But, you know, we've got to be realistic about what's going on.
[01:49:25.586 --> 01:49:26.987]  Listen, we've got people everywhere.
[01:49:28.248 --> 01:49:39.834]  In government everywhere, and every... the military, the police, and our numbers are growing, and the globalists, if they stage more terror attacks, or try more New World Order ops, need to know that this is getting very serious.
[01:49:40.335 --> 01:49:44.617]  Our people are growing exponentially, they're everywhere, and we're going to defend America.
[01:49:44.637 --> 01:49:45.677]  We're going to defend the Republic.
[01:49:46.338 --> 01:49:48.519]  And just understand New World Order, you better back off.
[01:49:48.879 --> 01:49:52.261]  You know, you know, that you're in a losing scenario.
[01:49:53.675 --> 01:49:54.616]  Stage a nuke attack.
[01:49:54.656 --> 01:49:55.677]  Try to blame it on somebody.
[01:49:55.717 --> 01:49:56.798]  It's not going to work, Globalist.
[01:49:57.618 --> 01:49:58.819]  Let's go ahead and make another call here.
[01:49:58.839 --> 01:49:59.880]  We've got to move really fast now.
[01:50:01.041 --> 01:50:04.884]  Let us talk to Stephan in New York.
[01:50:04.924 --> 01:50:05.465]  You're on the air.
[01:50:06.285 --> 01:50:09.628]  Yeah, I'd like to talk about that Jericho show that got canceled.
[01:50:09.828 --> 01:50:18.536]  It's like what they do, they... It's like when the government posts a notice in the paper about, we're going to take this car, do this thing.
[01:50:18.856 --> 01:50:19.356]  They do that.
[01:50:19.416 --> 01:50:21.358]  They did that with that Titan bug back in the...
[01:50:22.509 --> 01:50:23.690]  Yes, it's kabbalistic esoterica.
[01:50:23.970 --> 01:50:25.992]  I don't believe in it, but most of the elite
[01:50:41.005 --> 01:50:43.948]  And believe me, you start meeting billionaires, you say, do you believe in black magic?
[01:50:43.968 --> 01:50:45.289]  Do you believe in, and they'll say yes.
[01:50:46.090 --> 01:50:50.234]  I mean, these people are nuts, and I've got to move quick, great point.
[01:50:50.934 --> 01:51:04.647]  And yes, Lone Gunman episode, I've interviewed the people that wrote it, I've interviewed the stars of it, like Dean Haglund, the CIA came to them, planted that story basically on them, to do a simulation of a hijacked jet by remote control being flown to the World Trade Center.
[01:51:05.839 --> 01:51:15.705]  In the X-Files show, six months before 9-11, where the government then even was going to blame it on Afghanistan, and they were going to use hijacking drills to confuse NORAD so it stood down.
[01:51:15.965 --> 01:51:19.267]  I mean, the exact same thing six months before of what they really did.
[01:51:20.848 --> 01:51:23.749]  Like Tom Clancy admits the CIA gives him his plots.
[01:51:24.089 --> 01:51:25.610]  He wrote that a year before 9-11.
[01:51:26.351 --> 01:51:28.052]  And you'll find out the governor
[01:51:29.104 --> 01:51:38.449]  His brother, Keating's brother in Oklahoma, wrote a book, and a Tom McVeigh bombs the Alfred P. Murrah building, published one year before.
[01:51:39.090 --> 01:51:39.750]  Let me explain again.
[01:51:40.030 --> 01:51:44.312]  The governor's brother, and dedicated the book to the Knights of the Secret Circle.
[01:51:45.333 --> 01:51:48.555]  You might want to Google and find out what the Knights of the Secret Circle is.
[01:51:48.695 --> 01:51:49.735]  They're not very friendly.
[01:51:50.596 --> 01:51:52.557]  Pointed hats, I'll just leave it at that.
[01:51:53.738 --> 01:51:54.258]  Oh yeah.
[01:51:55.318 --> 01:51:56.599]  They like to brag.
[01:51:56.619 --> 01:51:57.820]  They like to leave an ace card.
[01:51:58.780 --> 01:52:00.762]  You read about psychopaths who leave mementos?
[01:52:00.822 --> 01:52:01.842]  Well, these are big psychos.
[01:52:02.823 --> 01:52:05.605]  I mean, I'm sure the governor's brother just... It's an accident.
[01:52:05.625 --> 01:52:06.226]  It's a coincidence.
[01:52:06.246 --> 01:52:07.086]  I'm sure everything's fine.
[01:52:07.687 --> 01:52:08.708]  I mean, you know, he's a good guy.
[01:52:08.828 --> 01:52:11.149]  And the Knights of the Secret Circle are very friendly, too.
[01:52:11.169 --> 01:52:13.191]  You know, that's his book, not mine.
[01:52:13.932 --> 01:52:16.493]  Let's go ahead and take another ring-a-dingy.
[01:52:17.054 --> 01:52:21.938]  Let's go ahead and talk to N.I.K., Nick in Arizona.
[01:52:22.018 --> 01:52:22.678]  You're on the air.
[01:52:22.698 --> 01:52:24.540]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:52:24.660 --> 01:52:24.880]  Good.
[01:52:26.008 --> 01:52:26.728]  I just want to thank you.
[01:52:26.748 --> 01:52:28.308]  You're an inspiration, absolutely.
[01:52:28.348 --> 01:52:35.870]  Me and my brother started this website called lookupandwakeup.org here in the Phoenix Valley, and we're starting to cover the chemtrails and the surveillance.
[01:52:35.890 --> 01:52:42.371]  I just want to give you a quick example of what happened to me the other night, about 12.30 in the morning or so.
[01:52:42.551 --> 01:52:43.971]  I was here in a chopper going over my house.
[01:52:44.572 --> 01:52:51.973]  About 20 minutes later, I go outside to have a cigarette, and I see the chopper in the distance, and as soon as I step outside, it goes towards me.
[01:52:52.509 --> 01:52:55.451]  And then all of a sudden he's got his lights shining down different houses or so.
[01:52:55.511 --> 01:52:57.592]  Good, you're all kind of.
[01:52:57.752 --> 01:52:59.193]  He can't have that chopper on the border.
[01:52:59.213 --> 01:52:59.934]  It's got to be on you.
[01:53:01.034 --> 01:53:01.215]  Yeah.
[01:53:01.655 --> 01:53:05.077]  And then now, so he started coming towards me, and then he was flashing in a different direction.
[01:53:05.097 --> 01:53:08.439]  He gave me a quick flash, and then he turned around my house.
[01:53:08.839 --> 01:53:10.100]  And it was a full moon that night.
[01:53:10.140 --> 01:53:10.961]  Well, drink fluoride.
[01:53:10.981 --> 01:53:11.641]  Everything's okay.
[01:53:12.382 --> 01:53:12.822]  Calm down.
[01:53:12.842 --> 01:53:13.382]  Drink fluoride.
[01:53:13.402 --> 01:53:13.943]  Drink fluoride.
[01:53:14.203 --> 01:53:14.963]  It's going to be alright.
[01:53:15.003 --> 01:53:15.544]  Submit to him.
[01:53:15.584 --> 01:53:15.944]  He's good.
[01:53:17.682 --> 01:53:24.786]  So I got out and all of a sudden I'm looking around and I'm hearing this chopper and then all of a sudden this guy's flying over my house like stealth mode.
[01:53:25.006 --> 01:53:27.488]  Didn't have his light on and I turn around and then BAM!
[01:53:27.808 --> 01:53:30.970]  The freakin' light is shining down on me like for no reason at all.
[01:53:31.050 --> 01:53:31.730]  I'm just staying up.
[01:53:31.770 --> 01:53:32.911]  Well, you're out, sir.
[01:53:32.951 --> 01:53:34.192]  You're evil, okay?
[01:53:34.892 --> 01:53:38.174]  You need to be tracked and traced and there's no more warrants, no more free speech.
[01:53:38.574 --> 01:53:39.595]  You're bad, okay?
[01:53:40.155 --> 01:53:40.895]  Submit to it.
[01:53:40.935 --> 01:53:41.776]  It doesn't exist.
[01:53:42.216 --> 01:53:43.757]  Trans-Texas Corridor doesn't exist.
[01:53:43.777 --> 01:53:45.318]  The billboards don't exist, CNN says.
[01:53:45.558 --> 01:53:46.899]  There's no toll roads on the roads.
[01:53:47.428 --> 01:53:49.870]  Cintra isn't Spanish owned, the Washington Chronicle says.
[01:53:50.231 --> 01:53:50.891]  Everything's fine.
[01:53:50.931 --> 01:53:51.372]  Go to sleep.
[01:53:51.412 --> 01:53:51.772]  Shut up.
[01:53:51.812 --> 01:53:52.493]  Submit to government.
[01:53:52.733 --> 01:53:53.093]  Love them.
[01:53:53.133 --> 01:53:53.834]  Drink your fluoride.
[01:53:53.854 --> 01:53:55.495]  Take your mercury-filled injections.
[01:53:55.756 --> 01:53:56.136]  Love them.
[01:53:56.176 --> 01:53:56.536]  Love them.
[01:53:57.397 --> 01:53:59.139]  Just please learn to submit to them.
[01:54:00.820 --> 01:54:01.581]  Oh, it's so simple.
[01:54:02.682 --> 01:54:07.826]  Yeah, the TV show Jericho, where the government nukes itself to bring in martial law.
[01:54:08.947 --> 01:54:10.008]  There's two ways to look at that.
[01:54:10.309 --> 01:54:13.852]  Is that them, like, putting an ad in the newspaper when they're going to repossess something?
[01:54:14.466 --> 01:54:16.087]  Or imminent domain.
[01:54:16.768 --> 01:54:17.328]  And it is.
[01:54:17.368 --> 01:54:18.950]  You know, a vampire from legend.
[01:54:19.010 --> 01:54:20.371]  I don't seem to really vampire.
[01:54:20.411 --> 01:54:21.592]  That's where those ideas come from.
[01:54:22.152 --> 01:54:23.053]  Has to trick you.
[01:54:23.093 --> 01:54:24.194]  Has to tell you what it's going to do.
[01:54:24.214 --> 01:54:27.056]  Has to trick you to have you invite them once into your house.
[01:54:27.597 --> 01:54:28.418]  Across the threshold.
[01:54:29.819 --> 01:54:35.824]  And Mayor Nagin was in a TV show called Oil Storm six months before the hurricane hit.
[01:54:35.864 --> 01:54:39.206]  And did the exact same thing the Made for TV movie did for FX.
[01:54:40.628 --> 01:54:41.668]  But again, it's a coincidence.
[01:54:41.748 --> 01:54:42.329]  Everything's fine.
[01:54:42.895 --> 01:54:46.463]  The government, of course, patented in 68 to control and create hurricanes.
[01:54:46.483 --> 01:54:47.866]  I've had the father of weather weapons.
[01:54:49.642 --> 01:54:54.564]  Before it was even on the Associated Press on, they can create and steer the hurricanes, but everything's fine.
[01:54:55.605 --> 01:54:58.186]  Let's go ahead now and take another call.
[01:54:58.246 --> 01:55:00.587]  Steve in Denver, Colorado.
[01:55:00.627 --> 01:55:01.268]  You're on the air.
[01:55:01.608 --> 01:55:02.908]  Hey Alex, good show again today.
[01:55:03.028 --> 01:55:17.935]  I was going to suggest, what if we had something like a Woodstock 9-11 big concert where we had one day where we had all these musicians and all these actors and famous people come together and we just spent one day, and I'm kind of helping the people with our architects and engineers for 9-11 Truth right now.
[01:55:17.975 --> 01:55:18.896]  We've suggested that.
[01:55:19.306 --> 01:55:26.590]  As a media event, and we could just have one major big event that we could videotape, sell, and try to show everybody how many people there are from the show.
[01:55:26.610 --> 01:55:29.992]  Sure, here's the problem, you know, and it's like that in any society or group.
[01:55:31.192 --> 01:55:33.954]  It would take a lot of groups getting involved, and the groups would never agree.
[01:55:34.794 --> 01:55:40.017]  And also, no one group, I'm probably the only person that could actually pull it off, could go out and get the celebrities.
[01:55:40.597 --> 01:55:46.180]  Because the celebrities don't know or don't trust, because they don't know these other groups, they haven't been around as long as I am.
[01:55:46.530 --> 01:55:49.291]  You know, the celebrities just call me up, and the phone rings, and they're on.
[01:55:50.532 --> 01:55:54.474]  And that's because they know I've been around a long time, they're aware of what I've been doing a long time.
[01:55:54.954 --> 01:56:02.478]  That's been batted around by people, but I haven't really actively gone out and pushed it, just because I couldn't imagine the headache of it all.
[01:56:03.238 --> 01:56:18.608]  Uh, plus the logistics of trying to get people who are in rock bands or people that have national number one TV shows or people that are, you know, best actress or, you know, people who, you know, make movies about pirates or people who, you know, trying to get all these groups together to do that at one time.
[01:56:19.069 --> 01:56:20.370]  It could probably be done.
[01:56:21.731 --> 01:56:23.752]  But then people don't even want you to charge for the tickets.
[01:56:23.772 --> 01:56:28.555]  You know, you're supposed to rent some park or get someplace and it's, you know, $100,000 a day.
[01:56:29.436 --> 01:56:32.037]  You know, in a big city like New York or LA, how much a building that holds 1,500 is?
[01:56:33.792 --> 01:56:35.053]  It's like $40,000 a day.
[01:56:36.613 --> 01:56:38.634]  And then you get it and groups try to block you.
[01:56:38.694 --> 01:56:41.735]  I had that LA Symposium with Charlie Sheen and a bunch of other big people.
[01:56:42.255 --> 01:56:44.256]  The guy that made Enemy of the State was there, a bunch of others.
[01:56:44.996 --> 01:56:46.937]  And people tried to get that shut down.
[01:56:46.957 --> 01:56:49.298]  They tried to put pressure on Sheridan.
[01:56:49.958 --> 01:56:52.299]  And I had to basically threaten people to not let them cancel it.
[01:56:52.339 --> 01:56:53.800]  Nobody ever knew about that, I'm telling you now.
[01:56:54.620 --> 01:56:55.300]  So it's not fun.
[01:56:58.712 --> 01:57:01.514]  You know, I'd rather just sit in there body-blowin' the New World Order.
[01:57:02.235 --> 01:57:04.817]  I'm, uh, doin' interviews every day on other radio shows.
[01:57:04.917 --> 01:57:06.979]  My website's gettin' millions of visitors a week.
[01:57:07.739 --> 01:57:08.900]  Other people are comin' to public.
[01:57:08.920 --> 01:57:09.821]  We're just spreadin' the word.
[01:57:10.762 --> 01:57:13.964]  Man, they've had little Woodstocks and little meetings with a few thousand people out of them, I have.
[01:57:14.725 --> 01:57:15.866]  Uh, but yeah, it might be a good idea.
[01:57:15.906 --> 01:57:16.426]  It'd be fun.
[01:57:17.427 --> 01:57:19.249]  C-SPAN carried our symposium, we did.
[01:57:19.569 --> 01:57:20.269]  Heard it four times.
[01:57:20.770 --> 01:57:21.871]  All right, we're out of time.
[01:57:21.931 --> 01:57:24.393]  Sorry to Galen, Josh, and Kyle.
[01:57:25.213 --> 01:57:27.795]  But I'll see you back next Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:57:27.835 --> 01:57:28.176]  Central.
[01:57:28.977 --> 01:57:30.279]  And, of course, during the weekday show.
[01:57:30.319 --> 01:57:31.101]  God bless you all.
[01:57:31.141 --> 01:57:34.987]  Great job, the producer of this show, Eddie Bear and Paul and everybody else.
[01:57:35.828 --> 01:57:37.170]  Get out there and take on the new old order.
[01:57:37.190 --> 01:57:37.891]  We don't have a choice.
[01:57:38.653 --> 01:57:39.013]  Take care.
[01:57:40.490 --> 01:57:41.531]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
